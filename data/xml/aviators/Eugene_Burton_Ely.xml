'''Eugene Burton Ely''' (October 21, 1886&lt;ref&gt;1900 census, Scott County, Iowa.[http://www.forensicgenealogy.info/images/ely_1900_census.jpg] Williamsburg (IA) Historical Commission Obituary Collection Index {{cite web |url=http://iagenweb.org/iowa/bmd/obits-index-netha-2-body.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120709161408/http://iagenweb.org/iowa/bmd/obits-index-netha-2-body.htm |archivedate=July 9, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  – October 19, 1911) was an [[aviator|aviation pioneer]], credited with the first shipboard aircraft [[takeoff|take off]] and [[landing]].

==Background==
Ely was born in [[Williamsburg, Iowa]], and raised in [[Davenport, Iowa]]. Having completed the eighth grade, he graduated from Davenport Grammar School 4 in January 1901.&lt;ref&gt;Davenport ''Daily Leader'', January 21, 1901, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Although some sources indicate that he attended and graduated from the [[Iowa State University]] in 1904 (when he would have been 17), the registrar of ISU reports that there is no record of his having done so - nor did he attend the University of Iowa or the University of Northern Iowa.&lt;ref&gt;Becky Jordan, reference specialist, Iowa State University, March 12, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Ely likewise does not appear in the graduations lists for Davenport High School. &lt;ref&gt;Richardson-Sloane Special Collections Center, Davenport Public Library, March 26, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; 
By 1904, Ely was employed as a chauffeur to the Rev. Fr. Smyth, a Catholic priest in [[Cosgrove, Iowa]], who shared Ely's love of fast driving; in Father Smyth's car (a red Franklin), Ely set the speed record between Iowa City and Davenport.&lt;ref&gt;Iowa City ''Daily Press'', August 26, 1904, p. 4; September 28, 1904, p. 4; December 3, 1904, p. 8; December 5, 1904, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Ely was living in San Francisco at the time of the great earthquake and fire of 1906&lt;ref&gt;Williamsburg ''Journal Tribune'', April 26, 1906, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; and was active there in the early days of the sales and [[auto racing|racing]] of automobiles.&lt;ref name="proceedings"&gt;Moore (January 1981) pp.58–63&lt;/ref&gt; He married Mabel Hall on August 7, 1907; he was 21 and she was 17, which meant the marriage required her mother's consent;&lt;ref name="proceedings"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://genforum.genealogy.com/ca/marin/messages/85.html ''Genforum Genealogy''] courtesy of Cathy Gowder&lt;/ref&gt; they honeymooned in Colorado.&lt;ref&gt;Williamsburg ''Journal Tribune'', August 29, 1907, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;  The Elys relocated to [[Nevada City, California]], in 1909, and for a time he drove an "auto stage" delivery route.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nevadacityadvocate.com/nevada-city/3723.html |title=Nevada City ''Advocate'' |accessdate=March 12, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610212710/http://www.nevadacityadvocate.com/nevada-city/3723.html |archivedate=June 10, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The couple moved to [[Portland, Oregon]], in early 1910, where he got a job as an auto salesman, working for [[E. Henry Wemme]].&lt;ref name="proceedings"/&gt; [[1910 in aviation|Soon after]], Wemme purchased one of [[Glenn Curtiss]]' first four-cylinder [[biplane]]s and acquired the [[franchising|franchise]] for the [[Pacific Northwest]]. Wemme was unable to fly the [[Curtiss Model D|Curtiss biplane]], but Ely, believing that flying was as easy as driving a car, offered to fly it. He ended up crashing it instead, and feeling responsible, he bought the wreck from Wemme.&lt;ref name="proceedings"/&gt;  Within a few months he had repaired the aircraft and learned to fly.&lt;ref name="proceedings"/&gt;  He flew it in the Portland area, then headed to [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]] in June 1910 to participate in an exhibition, where he met Curtiss and started working for him.&lt;ref name="proceedings"/&gt; After an unsuccessful attempt in [[Sioux City, Iowa]],&lt;ref&gt;''Atlantic Daily Telegraph'', July 2, 1910, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Ely's first reported exhibition on behalf of Curtiss was in [[Winnipeg]] in July 1910.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.winnipegrealtors.ca/Resources/Article/?sysid=74|title=WinnipegREALTORS®|work=winnipegrealtors.ca|accessdate=November 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ely received the [[Aero Club of America]] pilot's license #17 on October 5, 1910.&lt;ref name="proceedings"/&gt;

==Naval aviation firsts==
[[File:First airplane takeoff from a warship.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Ely takes off from the [[USS Birmingham (CL-2)|USS ''Birmingham'']], Hampton Roads, Virginia, November 14, 1910]]
In October, Ely and Curtiss met Captain [[Washington Chambers]], USN, who had been appointed by [[George von Lengerke Meyer]], the [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]], to investigate military uses for [[Naval aviation|aviation within the Navy]]. This led to two experiments. On November 14, 1910, Ely took off in a Curtiss [[Pusher configuration|pusher]] from a temporary platform erected over the bow of the [[light cruiser]] [[USS Birmingham (CL-2)|USS ''Birmingham'']].&lt;ref name="proceedings"/&gt;{{refn|Modifications for take-off required outfitting the ship with "an 83-foot-long ramp, sloping 5 degrees over the bow. The ramp’s forward edge was 37 feet above the water".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mersky|first1=P.|date=|year=2011|title=Ely’s Flights – Part 1, The First Launch|journal=Approach: The Naval Safety Center's Aviation Magazine|volume=56|issue=1|page=3|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;| group="nb"}}  The airplane plunged downward as soon as it cleared the 83-foot platform runway; and the aircraft wheels dipped into the water before rising.&lt;ref name="proceedings"/&gt;  Ely's goggles were covered with spray, and the aviator promptly landed on a beach rather than circling the harbor and landing at the Norfolk Navy Yard as planned.&lt;ref name="proceedings"/&gt;  John Barry Ryan offered $500 to build the platform, and a $500 prize, for a ship to shore flight.&lt;ref&gt;Hiller B. Zobel, John H. Zobel, "Those Magnificent Men", ''American Heritage'', Winter 2011, pp.46–51&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:USS Pennsylvania - First airplane landing.jpg|250px|thumb|left|First fixed-wing aircraft landing on a warship: Ely landing his plane on board the [[USS Pennsylvania (ACR-4)|USS ''Pennsylvania'']] in San Francisco Bay, January 18, 1911.]]
Two months later, on January 18, 1911, Ely landed his Curtiss pusher airplane on a platform on the [[armored cruiser]] [[USS Pennsylvania (ACR-4)|USS ''Pennsylvania'']] anchored in [[San Francisco Bay]].{{refn|"The landing platform, constructed of pine planks, was 130 feet long by 32 feet wide. Ten feet of it hung at an angle – with a drop of four feet – over the stern of the ship. The arresting gear comprised 21 ropes – each with 50-pound sandbags attached to either end – laid across the runway. Each rope was suspended 8 inches above the deck. Three hooks had been affixed to the underside of the aircraft to catch on the ropes when the landing was made".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Demers|first1=D.J.|date=|year=2011|title=What goes up…|journal=Naval History |volume=25|issue=1|page=48|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;| group="nb"}}  Ely flew from the [[Tanforan Racetrack]] in [[San Bruno, California]] and landed on the ''Pennsylvania'', which was the first successful shipboard landing of an aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/events/ev-1910s/ev-1911/ely-pa.htm Accessed February 8, 2007.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/pers-us/uspers-e/eb-ely.htm Accessed February 8, 2007.]&lt;/ref&gt; This flight was also the first ever using a [[tailhook]] system, designed and built by circus performer and aviator [[Hugh Armstrong Robinson|Hugh Robinson]].&lt;ref name="proceedings"/&gt;  Ely told a reporter: "It was easy enough. I think the trick could be successfully turned nine times out of ten."

Ely communicated with the United States Navy requesting employment, but United States naval aviation was not yet organized.&lt;ref name="proceedings"/&gt;  Ely continued flying in exhibitions while Captain Chambers promised to "keep him in mind" if Navy flying stations were created.&lt;ref name="proceedings"/&gt;  Captain Chambers advised Ely to cut out the sensational features for his safety and the sake of aviation.&lt;ref name="proceedings"/&gt;  When asked about retiring, ''The Des Moines Register'' quoted Ely as replying: "I guess I will be like the rest of them, keep at it until I am killed."&lt;ref name="proceedings"/&gt;

[[File:1911 Curtiss-Ely Pusher Replica 2.jpg|thumb|[[Curtiss Model D|Curtiss Pusher]] replica in flight in 2011]]
To commemorate the 100th anniversary of the flight, Naval Commander Bob Coolbaugh flew a personally built replica of Ely's Curtiss from the runway at [[NAS Norfolk]] on November 12, 2010. The U.S. Navy planned to feature the flying demonstration at Naval anniversary events across America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EAAer Flies Curtiss Pusher Replica in Navy Centennial Ceremony|url=http://www.eaa.org/news/2010/2010-11-18_pusher.asp|accessdate=December 6, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125110039/http://www.eaa.org/news/2010/2010-11-18_pusher.asp|archivedate=November 25, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
On October 19, 1911, while flying at an exhibition in [[Macon, Georgia]], his plane was late pulling out of a dive and crashed.&lt;ref name="proceedings"/&gt;  Ely jumped clear of the wrecked aircraft, but his neck was broken, and he died a few minutes later.&lt;ref name="proceedings"/&gt; Spectators picked the wreckage clean looking for souvenirs, including Ely's gloves, tie, and cap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Skylark: the life, lies, and inventions of [[Harry Atwood]]|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; On what would have been his twenty-fifth birthday, his body was returned to his birthplace for burial.&lt;ref&gt;Cedar Rapids ''Evening Gazette'', October 21, 1911, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 16, 1933, Congress awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (USA)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] posthumously to Ely, "for extraordinary achievement as a pioneer civilian aviator and for his significant contribution to the development of aviation in the United States Navy."&lt;ref&gt;''U.S. Air Services'', Vol. XVIII No. 3 p. 14 (March 1933)&lt;/ref&gt; An exhibit of retired naval aircraft at [[Naval Air Station Norfolk]] in Virginia bears Ely's name, and a granite historical marker in [[Newport News, Virginia]], overlooks the waters where Ely made his historic flight in 1911 and recalls his contribution to military aviation, naval in particular.
