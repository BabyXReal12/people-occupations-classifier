'''James "Jabby" Jabara''' (10 October 1923 – 17 November 1966) was the first American and [[United States Air Force]] [[flying ace|jet ace]] in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=[[United Press International|United Press]]|title=Jet Ace Out of Combat|work=[[The New York Times]], ''22 May 1951 (Fee required)''|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0E16FF39591A7B93C0AB178ED85F458585F9|accessdate=9 July 2011|date=22 May 1951}}&lt;/ref&gt; Born in Oklahoma, he lived in Kansas where he enlisted as an aviation cadet at [[Fort Riley]] after graduating from high school. Jabara attended four flying schools in Texas before he received his pilot's wings and was commissioned as a second lieutenant. Jabara flew two tours of combat duty in Europe during [[World War II]] as a [[North American P-51 Mustang]] pilot, and scored 1.5 air victories against German aircraft.

Jabara flew his first jet aircraft in 1948, the USAF [[Lockheed F-80 Shooting Star]] before transitioning to the USAF [[North American F-86 Sabre]]. Jabara used this aircraft to shoot down multiple Soviet-built [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15|MiG-15]] jets during the [[Korean War]]. He achieved his first confirmed air victory of the war on 3 April 1951. A month later he scored his fifth and sixth victories, making him the first American jet ace in history. He eventually scored 15 victories, giving him the title of "triple ace". Jabara was ranked as the second-highest-scoring U.S. ace of the Korean War. He received the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]], [[Silver Star]], [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]], [[Air Medal]], and the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|British Distinguished Flying Cross]] for his accomplishments in combat.

Jabara next held a series of commands at various Air Force bases across the United States. He flew the [[Lockheed F-104 Starfighter]] and later the [[Convair B-58 Hustler]]. In 1966, while on leave from service in Vietnam, Colonel Jabara was traveling with his family in two cars to their new home when his daughter crashed the car she was driving and he was riding in, killing them both. They were buried together at [[Arlington National Cemetery]]. In recognition of his contributions to military aviation, an airport outside of Wichita, Kansas was named in his honor. Each year the [[United States Air Force Academy]] alumni association bestows the [[Jabara Award]] upon an Academy graduate whose aerospace accomplishments demonstrate superior performance.

==Early life==
Jabara was born in [[Muskogee, Oklahoma]],&lt;ref name="Crash"&gt;{{cite news|agency=[[United Press International]]|title=First American Jet Ace Dies As Car Overturns in Florida|work=[[The New York Times]], ''18 November 1966 (Fee required)''|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0815FD3C5A137B93CAA8178AD95F428685F9|accessdate=9 July 2011|date=18 November 1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] descent; his father, John, and mother came from [[Marjayoun]], a town in [[Southern Lebanon]].&lt;ref name="Heroism"&gt;{{cite news|last=Dorr |first=Robert F. |title=History: Heroism across the ages |work=[[Navy Times]], ''2 September 2007'' |url=http://www.navytimes.com/community/opinion/airforce_60th_incredibleflights_070924w/ |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/604IwkPb1?url=http://www.navytimes.com/community/opinion/airforce_60th_incredibleflights_070924w/ |archivedate=10 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jabara joined the [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scouts]], eventually becoming an [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]].&lt;ref name="AirW"&gt;Boyne 2001, p. 331.&lt;/ref&gt; At an early age, he was set on becoming a pilot, "I used to read articles about [[Eddie Rickenbacker|[Eddie] Rickenbacker]] and all these novels you read about air combat, and I guess from the sixth grade it was my ambition to be a fighter pilot."&lt;ref name="HistAce"&gt;{{cite news|last=Allmon|first=William B|title=Captain James Jabara: Ace of the Korean War|work=Aviation History, ''March 1995''|publisher=HistoryNet.com|url=http://www.historynet.com/captain-james-jabara-ace-of-the-korean-war.htm|accessdate=10 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He worked at his parents' grocery store&lt;ref name="Young"&gt;{{cite news|last=Patrick |first=Bethanne Kelly |title=Col.

==World War II==
[[File:JamesJabaraCockpix1940s.jpg|thumb|right|Jabara sitting in a cockpit c. 1940s]]
During [[World War II]], the [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] fought German aircraft across the [[European Theatre of World War II|European Theater]]. The Allies used several fighter aircraft, including the [[North American P-51 Mustang]]. Jabara was assigned to two tours of combat duty as a P-51 pilot across Europe. His first tour lasted from January to October 1944 with the [[363d Training Group|363d Fighter Group]] of the [[Ninth Air Force]]. On his first mission he was assigned to attacking German railroad targets in [[Belgium]].&lt;ref name="HistAce"/&gt; In a March 1944 mission while Jabara was escorting bombers to Germany, a German pilot shot off his canopy. Although he faced below freezing temperatures at the high altitude, he was able to shoot down a German aircraft before returning to base.&lt;ref name="Lead"/&gt; During one mission, while in formation, he and another P-51 pilot collided in midair. They both safely bailed out while the aircraft were destroyed.&lt;ref name="Blue"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Randall|first=Peter|title=Database Search|publisher=Little Friends|url=http://www.littlefriends.co.uk/search.php?action=list_records&amp;searchString=jabara&amp;sort_order=ASC&amp;order_by=Pilot&amp;recs=100|accessdate=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another incident, while Jabara engaged a German aircraft, they collided in mid-air, and when both pilots safely floated to the ground, they met and shook hands.&lt;ref name="Young"/&gt; When Jabara's first tour ended, he returned to the United States as an instructor for other pilots.&lt;ref name="Blue"/&gt; He returned to Europe again for his second tour from February to December 1945 with the [[355th Operations Group|355th Group]] of the [[Eighth Air Force]].&lt;ref name="Lead"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Blue"/&gt; During his European combat (and known then as "the Ceegar Kid" for his penchant for smoking cigars), Jabara flew 108 combat missions.&lt;ref name="HistAce"/&gt; He was credited with the destruction of one and a half German aircraft in aerial combat (the half considered shared with another pilot)&lt;ref&gt;Wyllie 2005 (''WWII Victories''), p. 397.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dorr et al. 1995, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; and four on the ground. He received a [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] with one [[Oak Leaf Cluster]] for his 1.5 victories as well as an [[Air Medal]] with 18 Oak Leaf Clusters.&lt;ref name="AirW"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HistAce"/&gt;

After World War II, Jabara considered leaving the military to attend college, but later decided to attend the Tactical Air School at [[Tyndall Air Force Base]], [[Florida]].&lt;ref name="HistAce"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lead"/&gt; From 1947 to 1949 he was stationed on [[Okinawa]] with the [[53d Fighter Group]].&lt;ref name="Lead"/&gt; At Okinawa in 1948, Jabara flew his first jet aircraft, the  Lockheed [[F-80 Shooting Star]].&lt;ref name="HistAce"/&gt; Reflecting on the transition to jet aircraft, he said "It was entirely different. I was at 10,000 feet before I remembered to raise my landing gear. ...It was so quiet and fast. ...I guess that was probably the happiest moment of my life."&lt;ref name="HistAce"/&gt; Jabara returned to the United States and was assigned as a flight commander, now at the rank of captain, with the [[4th Fighter Wing|4th Fighter-Interceptor Wing]], flying the newly operational North American [[F-86 Sabre]] jet fighter at the [[New Castle Airport|New Castle County Airport]] in [[Delaware]].&lt;ref name="HistAce"/&gt;

==Korean War==
[[File:JamesJabaraCockpitStanding1950s.jpg|thumb|left|Jabara standing on his F-86 Sabre in April 1953]]
Before the start of the [[Korean War]], the [[Korean Peninsula]] was split by an American-backed government at the south and a Soviet-backed opposing government at the north. Divided by the [[Division of Korea|38th Parallel]], both the United States and the Soviet Union agreed to maintain the division until a mutual decision was made about the future of the peninsula. On 25 June 1950, North Korean troops crossed the parallel and attacked several key South Korean targets. As the United States prepared military assistance with the South Koreans, the Soviet Union also helped the North Koreans by training pilots and providing [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15|MiG-15]] aircraft. Jabara arrived in Korea on 13 December 1950 with the [[334th Fighter Squadron|334th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron]] of the 4th Fighter-Interceptor Wing. The squadron was the first F-86 Sabre unit deployed to the [[Fifth Air Force]] to counter the threat by the Soviet MiG-15s.&lt;ref name="Blue"/&gt; By 2 January 1951, he had flown five combat missions in F-86s and had damaged one MiG-15 Korean jet fighter in air combat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Parrott|first=Lindesay|title=Attack Gains Some Ground On Right Flank of 8th Army|work=[[The New York Times]], ''31 December 1950 (Fee required)''|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1950/12/31/archives/attack-gains-some-ground-on-right-flank-of-8th-army-un-troops.html|accessdate=9 July 2011|date=31 December 1950}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jabara achieved his first confirmed victory on 3 April 1951 when 12 F-86 Sabres took on 12 MiG-15s in [[MiG Alley]], a region in northwestern [[North Korea]].&lt;ref name="HistAce"/&gt; He was credited with another on 10 April, a third on 12 April,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=''The New York Times'' staff|title=Foe Seeks to Halt Attack|work=[[The New York Times]], ''13 April 1951 (Fee required)''|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1951/04/13/archives/8-migs-destroyed-in-great-air-fight-us-fliers-score-in-clashes-as.html|accessdate=9 July 2011|date=13 April 1951}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a fourth on 22 April. Eager to get his fifth victory to be deemed a flying ace, Jabara voluntarily transferred to the [[335th Fighter Squadron|335th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron]] when the 334th was rotated back to the United States.&lt;ref name="HistAce"/&gt;

On 20 May, two flights of F-86 Sabres encountered multiple MiG-15s in MiG Alley, and through radio communications, two additional flights of F-86 Sabres joined the battle, including Jabara.&lt;ref name="JWar"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Farris |first=Phillip |title=Jet War |journal=[[Air Force Association|Air Force Magazine]] |url=http://www.airforce-magazine.com/MagazineArchive/Pages/1990/June%201990/0690jetwar.aspx |volume=73 |number=6, June 1990 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/604txzV3L?url=http://www.airforce-magazine.com/MagazineArchive/Pages/1990/June%201990/0690jetwar.aspx |archivedate=10 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In preparation for the oncoming battle, Jabara and the other F-86 Sabre pilots were ordered to jettison their auxiliary fuel tanks to improve their maneuverability. Jabara's right fuel tank failed to separate from his wing, and protocol required he return to base as the aircraft would be impeded by the extra weight and imbalance, and limit his potential to match off with a MiG.&lt;ref name="Carrot"/&gt; However, with his desire to become a jet ace, Jabara decided to continue to the air battle, where he was able to still handle his aircraft well enough to be credited with shooting down two MiG-15s with .50 caliber machine gun fire.&lt;ref name="Heroism"/&gt; The first was in a group of three MiGs and the other was the last in a six-plane group. Jabara was able to see the first aircraft explode from his gunfire, but he only saw his second victory go into a tailspin as he was avoiding being targeted by another MiG.&lt;ref&gt;Gurney 1958, p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt; His fifth and sixth victories made Jabara the first American in history to use jet aircraft to become an ace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=[[Associated Press]]|title=U.N.

Nevertheless, American military forces claimed that Jabara was the first jet-versus-jet ace.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.acig.org/artman/publish/article_315.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; Jabara later stated in an interview, "That was my bag for the day, and it made me feel pretty good to know that I was the first jet ace in the history of aerial warfare."&lt;ref name="Blue"/&gt; The mission was his 63rd&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=[[United Press International|United Press]]|title=Jabara to Fight Again|work=[[The New York Times]], ''26 November 1952 (Fee required)''|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1952/11/26/archives/jabara-to-fight-again-jet-ace-receives-permission-to-complete-tour.html|accessdate=9 July 2011|date=26 November 1952}}&lt;/ref&gt; Korean mission of an eventual 163;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=[[Associated Press]]|title=Jabara Misses Record|work=[[The New York Times]], ''18 July 1953''|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was awarded a [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]], the nation's second-highest decoration.&lt;ref name="AirW"/&gt;

Against his wishes, Jabara received a stateside leave for a publicity tour. The Jabara family grocery store in Wichita was thronged with people for days, and both he and his father John appeared on local and national radio and television. Wichita mounted one of its most-attended parades in the city's history.&lt;ref name="Carrot"/&gt; Jabara was even sent on a goodwill tour with his father through the Middle East, and gave a speech in his father's hometown of Marjayoun, Lebanon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=[[Associated Press]]|title=Jet Ace Pilot on Tour|work=[[The New York Times]], ''8 January 1952 (Fee required)''|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1952/01/08/archives/jet-ace-pilot-on-tour-major-jabara-takes-father-on-middle-east.html|accessdate=11 July 2011|date=8 January 1952}}&lt;/ref&gt; Film [[newsreels]] included footage of his aircraft and other accolades included his own song ("That Jabara Bird") and a ritual rewarding of his Distinguished Service Cross at a Boston baseball game.&lt;ref name="HistAce"/&gt; Jabara returned to the United States in May 1951 for temporary assignment to Air Force Headquarters, Washington, D.C.

By then a major, on his second tour, Jabara was credited with shooting down nine more MiGs for a total of 15 victories.&lt;ref name="Blue"/&gt; On 16 May 1953 he recorded his seventh victory, and on 26 May he shot down two additional MiGs for a total of nine for the war.&lt;ref name="HistAce"/&gt; On 10 June, Jabara shot down two more MiGs. Eight days later his flight group encountered four MiGs, and he encountered mechanical problems that nearly caused his aircraft to crash into an elevated hill. After resolving his aircraft's issues, he returned to the battle and was able to shoot down an already damaged MiG.&lt;ref name="HistAce"/&gt; On 30 June, his first of two missions for the day resulted in one MiG victory. The second mission involved escorting F-86 Sabre fighter-bombers and he shot down a MiG before he came under heavy fire by other MiGs. In an attempt to evade their attack, he quickly accelerated but his engine flamed out. He maneuvered his aircraft for the ocean for a potential water rescue if he crashed, but he was able to restart the engine and return to base.&lt;ref name="HistAce"/&gt; Jabara recorded his final victory on 15 July.&lt;ref name="HistAce"/&gt; Two days later he flew his last two missions, and although he was eager to find more MiGs in an attempt to tie or surpass [[Joseph C.
