'''Rajiv Ratna Gandhi''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|ɑː|dʒ|iː|v|_|ˈ|ɡ|ɑː|n|d|iː|audio=Hi-RajivGandhi.ogg}}; 20 August 1944 – 21 May 1991) was an Indian politician who served as the 7th [[List of Prime Ministers of India|Prime Minister of India]] from 1984 to 1989. He took office after the [[Assassination of Indira Gandhi|1984 assassination]] of his mother, Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]], to become the youngest Indian Prime Minister at the age of 40.

Gandhi was a [[lineal descendant|scion]] of the politically powerful [[Nehru–Gandhi family]], which had been associated with the [[Indian National Congress]] party. For much of his childhood, his maternal grandfather [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] was Prime Minister. Gandhi attended college in the United Kingdom. He returned to India in 1966 and became a professional pilot for the state-owned [[Indian Airlines]]. In 1968 he married [[Sonia Gandhi]]; the couple settled in Delhi to a domestic life with their children [[Rahul Gandhi]] and [[Priyanka Gandhi Vadra]]. For much of the 1970s, his mother [[Indira Gandhi]] was prime minister and his brother [[Sanjay Gandhi]] (earlier Sanjay) an MP; despite this, Rajiv Gandhi remained apolitical. After Sanjay's death in an aeroplane crash in 1980, Gandhi reluctantly entered politics at the behest of Indira. The following year he won his brother's Parliamentary seat of [[Amethi (Lok Sabha constituency)|Amethi]] and became a member of the [[Lok Sabha]]—the lower house of [[Parliament of India|India's Parliament]]. As part of his political grooming, Rajiv was made a general secretary of the Congress party and given significant responsibility in organising the [[1982 Asian Games]].

On the morning of 31 October 1984, his mother was assassinated by two of her bodyguards; later that day, Gandhi was appointed Prime Minister. His leadership was tested over the next few days as organised mobs [[1984 anti-Sikh riots|rioted against the Sikh community]], resulting in riots in Delhi. That December, an [[Indian general election, 1984|almost nationwide sympathy vote]] for the Congress party helped it win the largest Lok Sabha majority to date, 411 seats out of 542. Rajiv Gandhi's period in office was mired in controversies; perhaps the greatest crises were the [[Bhopal disaster]] and the [[Shah Bano case]]. In 1988 he reversed the [[1988 Maldives Coup|coup in Maldives]], antagonising militant Tamil groups such as [[People's Liberation Organisation of Tamil Eelam|PLOTE]], intervening and then sending [[Indian Peace Keeping Force|peacekeeping]] troops to Sri Lanka in 1987, leading to open conflict with the [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]] (LTTE). In mid-1987 the [[Bofors scandal]] damaged his corruption-free image and resulted in a major defeat for his party in the [[Indian general election, 1989|1989 election]].

Gandhi remained [[Congress President]] until the [[Indian general election, 1991|elections in 1991]]. While campaigning for the elections, [[Assassination of Rajiv Gandhi|he was assassinated]] by a suicide bomber from the LTTE. His widow Sonia became the president of the Congress party in 1998 and led the party to victory in the 2004 and 2009 parliamentary elections. His son Rahul is a Member of Parliament and the current President of Indian National Congress. In 1991 the Indian government posthumously awarded Gandhi the [[Bharat Ratna]], the country's highest civilian award. At the India Leadership Conclave in 2009, the ''Revolutionary Leader of Modern India'' award was conferred posthumously on Gandhi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Special award bestowed on Rajiv Gandhi|url = http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/special-award-bestowed-on-rajiv-gandhi/article192344.ece|newspaper = The Hindu|date = 2009-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==
[[File:Indira Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Rajiv Gandhi and Sanjay Gandhi.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Indira Gandhi]], [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], Rajiv Gandhi and [[Sanjay Gandhi]]]]
Rajiv Gandhi was born in [[Bombay]] on 20 August 1944 to [[Indira Gandhi|Indira]] and [[Feroze Gandhi]]. In 1951, Rajiv and Sanjay were admitted to Shiv Niketan school, where the teachers said Rajiv was shy and introverted, and  "greatly enjoyed painting and drawing".&lt;ref&gt;Chand p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;  He was admitted to the [[Welham Boys' School]] and [[Doon School]] in 1954, where Sanjay joined him two years later.&lt;ref&gt;Agarwal, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Rajiv was sent to London in 1961 to study [[A-level]]s. From 1962 to 1965 he studied engineering at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], but did not obtain a degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rahul first in three generations with a world university degree|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2014/20140218/main6.htm|publisher=Tribune India|accessdate=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966 he began a course in mechanical engineering at [[Imperial College London]], but did not complete it. Gandhi really was not interested in 'mugging for his exams', as he went on to admit later.&lt;ref&gt;'GANDHI, Rajiv', Who Was Who, A &amp; C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 1920–2016; online edn, Oxford University Press, 2014; online edn, April 2014 [http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whowaswho/U172595 accessed 2 April 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

Gandhi returned to India in 1966, the year his mother became Prime Minister. He went to Delhi and became a member of the Flying Club, where he was trained as a pilot. In 1970, he was employed as a pilot by [[Air India]]; unlike Sanjay, he did not exhibit any interest of joining politics.&lt;ref&gt;Agarwal, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, after three years of courtship, he married [[Sonia Gandhi|Edvige Antonia Albina Màino]], who changed her name to Sonia Gandhi and made India her home. Their first child, a son, [[Rahul Gandhi]] was born in 1970. In 1972, the couple had a daughter, [[Priyanka Gandhi]], who married [[Robert Vadra]].&lt;ref&gt;Khan, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;

==Entry into politics==
On 23 June 1980, Rajiv's younger brother Sanjay Gandhi died unexpectedly in an airplane crash. At that time, Rajiv Gandhi was in London as part of his foreign tour. Hearing the news, he returned to Delhi and cremated Sanjay's body.&lt;ref&gt;Agarwal, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; As per Agarwal, in the week following Sanjay's death, Shankaracharya Swami Shri Swaroopanand, a saint from [[Badrinath]], visited the family's house to offer his condolences.&lt;ref&gt;Agarwal, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; He advised Rajiv not to fly aeroplanes and instead "dedicate himself to the service of the nation".&lt;ref name="Meenatt"&gt;Agarwal, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; 70 members of the Congress party signed a proposal and went to Indira, urging Rajiv to enter politics. Indira told them it was Rajiv's decision whether to enter politics. When he was questioned about it, he replied, "If my mother gets help from it, then I will enter politics".&lt;ref name="Meenatt"/&gt; Rajiv entered politics on 16 February 1981, when he addressed a national farmers' rally in Delhi.&lt;ref name="TH"&gt;Agarwal, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, he was still an employee of Air India.&lt;ref name="Anant"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kirusna Anant|title=India Since Independence: Making Sense of Indian Politics|publisher=Pearson Education India|isbn=9788131725672|page=257}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Participation in active politics===
On 4 May 1981, Indira Gandhi presided over a meeting of the [[All India Congress Committee]]. [[Vasantdada Patil]] proposed Rajiv as a candidate for the [[Amethi (Lok Sabha constituency)|Amethi constituency]], which was accepted by all members at the meeting. A week later, the party officially announced his candidacy for the constituency. He then paid the party membership fees of the party and flew to [[Sultanpur, Uttar Pradesh|Sultanpur]] to file his nomination papers and completed other formalities.&lt;ref&gt;Agarwal, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; He won the seat, defeating [[Lok Dal]] candidate [[Sharad Yadav]] by a margin of 237,000 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Satinder Sharma, Indra Sharma|title=Rajiv Gandhi: an annotated bibliography, 1944–1982|publisher=University of Michigan|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; He took his oath on 17 August as [[Member of Parliament]].&lt;ref name="Anant"/&gt;

Rajiv Gandhi's first political tour was to England, where he attended the wedding ceremony of [[Prince Charles]] and [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Lady Diana Spencer]] on 29 July 1981.&lt;ref name="TF"&gt;Agarwal, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; In December the same year, he was put in charge of the [[Indian Youth Congress]].&lt;ref name="TF"/&gt; He first showed his organisational ability by "working round the clock" on the [[1982 Asian Games]].&lt;ref&gt;Chand, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of 33 members of the Indian parliament who were part of the Games' organising committee; sports historian [[Boria Majumdar]] writes that being "son of the prime minister he had a moral and unofficial authority" over the others.&lt;ref name="Boria"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Boria Majumdar|authorlink1=Boria Majumdar|title=Olympics - The India Story|publisher=[[HarperCollins Publishers]]|isbn=9789350295090|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report submitted by the Asian Games committee mentions Gandhi's "drive, zeal and initiative" for the "outstanding success" of the games.&lt;ref name="Boria"/&gt;

===Indira Gandhi's death===
{{Main|1984 anti-Sikh riots}}
[[File:Rajiv Gandhi meeting Russian Hare Krishna devotees in New Delhi 1989.jpg|thumb|Meeting Russian [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna]] devotees in 1989.]]

On 31 October 1984, the Prime Minister, Rajiv Gandhi's mother Indira Gandhi, was assassinated by her Sikh bodyguards, which led to violent riots against Sikhs.&lt;ref name="AS"/&gt; At a Boat Club rally 19 days after the assassination, Gandhi said, "Some riots took place in the country following the murder of Indiraji. We know the people were very angry and for a few days it seemed that India had been shaken. But, when a mighty tree falls, it is only natural that the earth around it does shake a little".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Indu Prakash Singh|title=The aborted revolution|publisher=University of Michigan|page=235}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Verinder Grover, the statement made by Gandhi was a "virtual justification" of the riots.&lt;ref name="AS"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Verinder Grover|title=Indian Political System: Trends and Challenges|publisher=Deep and Deep Publications|isbn=9788171008834|page=366}}&lt;/ref&gt; Congress leader [[Mani Shankar Aiyar]] wrote, "Did it constitute an incitement to mass murder?" He also criticised Gandhi for his reluctance to bring the army from [[Meerut]] to handle the mob.&lt;ref&gt;Aiyar, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prime Minister of India==
Rajiv Gandhi was in West Bengal on 31 October 1984 when his mother, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, was assassinated by two of her Sikh bodyguards, [[Satwant Singh]] and [[Beant Singh (assassin)|Beant Singh]], to avenge the military attack on the [[Harmandir Sahib|Golden Temple]] during [[Operation Blue Star]]. Sardar Buta Singh and President [[Zail Singh]] pressed Rajiv to succeed his mother as Prime Minister within hours of her murder. Commenting on the anti-Sikh riots in Delhi, Rajiv Gandhi said, "When a giant tree falls, the earth below shakes";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl1504/15040190.htm |title=Back to the dynasty |work=Frontline |publisher=Hinduonnet.com |date=6 March 1998 |accessdate=7 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090110022524/http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl1504/15040190.htm |archivedate=10 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a statement for which he was widely criticised. Many Congress politicians were accused of orchestrating the violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/4130962.stm |title=World &amp;#124; South Asia &amp;#124; Leaders 'incited' anti-Sikh riots|publisher=BBC News  |date=8 August 2005 |accessdate=7 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after assuming office, Gandhi asked President Singh to dissolve Parliament and hold fresh elections, as the Lok Sabha had completed its five-year term. Gandhi officially became the President of the Congress party, which won a landslide victory with the largest majority in history of the Indian Parliament, giving Gandhi absolute control of government. He benefited from his youth and a general perception of being free of a background in corrupt politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | work=BBC News | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/29/newsid_3314000/3314987.stm | title =

===Cabinet ministers===
{{Main|Rajiv Gandhi ministry}}
After his swearing-in as Prime Minister, Gandhi appointed his fourteen-member cabinet. He said he would monitor their performance and would "fire ministers who do not come to the mark".{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} From the [[Third Indira Gandhi ministry]], he removed two powerful figures; Finance Minister [[Pranab Mukherjee]] and Railway Minister [[A. B. A. Ghani Khan Choudhury]]. [[Mohsina Kidwai]] became the Minister of Railways; she was the only female figure in the cabinet. Former Home Minister [[PV Narasimha Rao]] was put in charge of [[Minister of Defence (India)|defence]].&lt;ref name="oath"&gt;{{cite news|title=Rajiv Gandhi takes oath as India's prime minister|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=336&amp;dat=19841231&amp;id=sTdTAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=B4MDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3454,6835384&amp;hl=en|accessdate=25 May 2015|publisher=The Deseret News|date=31 December 1984|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[V.P.

The [[West Bengal]] chief minister [[Jyoti Basu]] said, "The Cabinet change reflects the instability of the Congress (I) Government at the Centre".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wheel of confusion|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/whenever-in-doubt-rajiv-gandhi-plays-the-cabinet-reshuffle-card/1/329067.html|publisher=India Today|accessdate=26 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-defection law===
Gandhi's first action as Prime Minister was passing the [[Parliamentary system|anti-defection law]] in January 1985. According to this law, an elected Member of Parliament or legislative assembly could not join an opposition party until the next election. Historian Manish Telikicherla Chary calls it a measure of curbing corruption and bribery of ministers by switching parties so they could gain majority.&lt;ref&gt;Chary, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; Many such defections occurred during the 1980s as elected leaders of the Congress party joined opposition parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Provisions of Anti-Defection Law in India|url=http://www.elections.in/political-corner/provisions-of-anti-defection-law-in-india/|publisher=Elections|accessdate=26 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shah Bano case===
{{Main|Shah Bano case}}

In 1985, the [[Supreme Court of India]] ruled in favour of Muslim divorcee [[Shah Bano]], declaring that her husband should give her [[alimony]]. Some Indian Muslims treated it as an encroachment upon [[Muslim Personal Law]] and protested against it. Gandhi agreed to their demands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://homepages.uc.edu/thro/shahbano/sb-rajiv.htm |title=Shah Bano – Rajiv Gandhi |publisher=Homepages.uc.edu |accessdate=7 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, the Parliament of India passed [[The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act 1986]], which nullified the Supreme Court's judgment in the Shah Bano case. The Act diluted the Supreme Court judgment and allowed maintenance payments to divorced women only during the period of [[Iddah]], or until 90 days after the divorce, according to the provisions of Islamic law. This was in contrast to Section 125 of the Code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=From Shah Bano to Salma|url=http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/from-shah-bano-to-salma/520890/0|publisher=Indian Express|accessdate=26 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Shah Bano legacy|url=http://www.hindu.com/2003/08/10/stories/2003081000221500.htm|publisher=The Hindu|accessdate=26 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indian magazine ''Business and Economics'' called it a minority appeasement by Gandhi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The ghost of Shah Bano|url=http://www.businessandeconomy.org/14052009/storyd.asp?sid=4364&amp;pageno=1|publisher=Business and Economy|accessdate=26 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lawyer and former Law Minister of India, [[Ram Jethmalani]], called the Act "retrogressive obscurantism for short-term minority populism".&lt;ref name="medio"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cementing of dynastic democracy|url=http://www.sunday-guardian.com/analysis/cementing-of-dynastic-democracy|publisher=Sunday Guardian|accessdate=26 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gandhi's colleague [[Arif Mohammad Khan]], who was then a Member of Parliament, resigned in protest.&lt;ref name=indiaafterind&gt;{{cite book|title=India Since Independence|date=1 January 2008|publisher=Penguin Books India|location=India|isbn=0143104098|page=362|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dE9qEg-NgHMC&amp;pg=PA362&amp;lpg=PA362&amp;dq=arif+mohammad+khan+muslim+shah+bano+resigned&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZH1m8ZhYR9&amp;sig=x2X64kRTARgjy428EyF73KnYxV8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Y_NkU6KZFdOhugTPyIK4Dg&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=arif%20mohammad%20khan%20muslim%20shah%20bano%20resigned&amp;f=false|author=Bipan Chandra|authorlink1=Bipan Chandra|author2=Aditya Mukherjee |author3=Mridula Mukherjee |editor=Penguin Books India}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also became compulsory for Muslim divorced men to give money to their ex wife

===Economic policy===
[[File:Pandit Ram Kishore Shukla with Rajiv Gandhi at 7, Race course road in 1988.jpg|thumb|Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi with [[Ram Kishore Shukla]] in 1988.]]

In his election manifesto for the [[Indian general election, 1984|1984 general election]], he did not mention any economic reforms, but after assuming office he tried to liberalise the country's economy.&lt;ref name="EP"&gt;Kohli, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; He did so by providing incentives to make private production profitable. Subsidies were given to corporate companies to increase industrial production, especially of durable goods. It was hoped this would increase economic growth and improve the quality of investment.&lt;ref&gt;Kohli, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; But according to Professor [[Atul Kohli]] of [[Princeton University]] in a book published by Cambridge University, Gandhi faced stiff opposition from Congress leadership who thought "it would open the economy to external economic influences".&lt;ref name="EP"/&gt; Rural and tribal people protested because they saw them as "pro-rich" and "pro-city" reforms.&lt;ref name="EP"/&gt;

Gandhi increased government support for science, technology and associated industries, and reduced import quotas, taxes and tariffs on technology-based industries, especially computers, airlines, defence and telecommunications. In 1986, he announced a [[National Policy on Education]] to modernise and expand higher education programs across India. In 1986, he founded the [[Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya]] System, which is a Central government-based education institution that provides rural populations with free residential education from grades six to twelve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.basearticles.com/Art/65874/216/Rajiv-Gandhi-aimed-at-value-based-education-in-rural-India-through-JNVs.html | title=Rajiv Gandhi aimed at value based education in rural India through JNVs | accessdate=19 February 2011 | publisher=Pressbrief}}&lt;/ref&gt; His efforts created [[MTNL]] in 1986, and his public call offices—better known as PCOs—helped develop the telephone network in rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://meachq.in/html/rahul_memo.pdf | title=MTNL Letter | accessdate=19 February 2011 | date=16 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He introduced measures to significantly reduce the ''[[Licence Raj]]'' after 1990, allowing businesses and individuals to purchase capital, consumer goods and import without bureaucratic restrictions.&lt;ref name="princeton.edu"&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.princeton.edu/~reddings/pubpapers/ABRZ_AER_Sept2008.pdf|title=Unequal effects of Liberalisation – Dismantling the license raj in India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign policy===

According to [[Rejaul Karim Laskar]], a scholar of [[Indian foreign policy]] and an ideologue of [[Indian National Congress|Congress party]], Rajiv Gandhi's vision for a new world order was premised on [[India]]'s place in its front rank.&lt;ref name="diplomatist.com"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Laskar|first1=Rejaul|title=Rajiv Gandhi's Diplomacy: Historic Significance and Contemporary  Relevance|journal=Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary Diplomatist|date=September 2014|volume=2|issue=9|page=46|url=http://www.diplomatist.com/dipom09y2014/article015.html|accessdate=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Rejaul Karim Laskar|Laskar]], the "whole gamut" of Rajiv Gandhi's [[foreign policy]] was "geared towards" making India "strong, independent, self-reliant and in the front rank of the nations of the world." &lt;ref name="diplomatist.com"/&gt; According to [[Rejaul Karim Laskar|Laskar]], Rajiv Gandhi's diplomacy was "properly calibrated" so as to be "conciliatory and accommodating when required" and "assertive when the occasion demanded." &lt;ref name="diplomatist.com"/&gt;

In 1986, by request of the President of Seychelles [[France-Albert René]], Gandhi sent India's navy to [[Seychelles]] to oppose an attempted coup against René. The intervention of India averted the coup. This mission was codenamed as [[Operation Flowers are Blooming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Modi to the land where India staged 'Operation Wild Flowers are Blooming'|url=http://www.aniin.com/top-story-details.php?va=MzEwMjA=|publisher=Asian News International|accessdate=26 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, India re-occupied the Quaid Post in the disputed [[Siachen]] region of the [[Indo-Pakistani border]] after winning what was termed [[Operation Rajiv]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1987 Siachen hero passes away|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/1987-Siachen-hero-passes-away/articleshow/16802705.cms|publisher=Times of India|accessdate=26 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[1988 Maldives coup d'état]], the Maldives president [[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom]] asked for help from Gandhi. He dispatched 1500 soldiers and the coup was suppressed.&lt;ref&gt;Agarwal, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in US House of Representatives.jpg|thumb|Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi gives a speech to the [[United States House of Representatives]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://commerce.wazeedigital.com/license/clip/587005_007.do]&lt;/ref&gt;]] --&gt;On Thursday, 9 June 1988, at the fifteenth special session of the [[United Nations General Assembly]], held at Headquarters, New York, Gandhi made vocal his views on a world free of nuclear weapons, to be realised through an, 'Action Plan for Ushering in a Nuclear-Weapon Free and Non-Violent World Order.'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/rajiv-gandhi-plan-a-valuable-solution/article559548.ece Rajiv Gandhi Plan: a valuable solution]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;PM Rajeev Gandhi at the Fifteenth special session of [[United Nations General Assembly]][http://fissilematerials.org/library/gan98.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

He said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Alas, nuclear weapons are not the only weapons of mass destruction. New knowledge is being generated in the life sciences. Military applications of these developments could rapidly undermine the existing convention against the military use of biological weapons. The ambit of our concern must extend to all means of mass [[annihilation]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This was based on his prior historic speech before the Japanese [[National Diet]] on 29 November 1985, in which he said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Let us remove the mental partitions which obstruct the ennobling vision of the human family linked together in peace and prosperity. The Buddha's message of compassion is the very condition of human survival in our age.&lt;ref&gt;Japanese [[National Diet]] on 29 November 1985 [http://www.sgiquarterly.org/global2009Oct-1.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ioc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~worldjpn/documents/indices/JPSA/index-ENG.html Documents related to Japan - South Asia Relations]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Speech by Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of India at the Joint Session of the Japanese Upper and Lower Houses [http://www.ioc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~worldjpn/documents/texts/JPSA/19851129.S1J.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The foiled bid of India recently to enter the [[Nuclear Suppliers Group]], echoed his policy of  non-proliferation to be linked to universal disarmament, which the [[World Nuclear Association]] refuses to recognise; non-proliferation being seen by India as essentially a weapon of the arms control regime, of the big nuclear powers as United States, Russia, United Kingdom, France, and China.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newslaundry.com/shorts/indias-nsg-bid-foiled-china-stands-tall-switzerland-backstabs/ India’s NSG bid foiled – China stands tall, Switzerland ‘backstabs’]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.dailypakistan.com.pk/pakistan/china-foils-indias-bid-to-join-nsg/ China foils India’s bid to join NSG]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pakistan====
In February 1987, the Pakistani President [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|Zia-ul-Haq]] visited Delhi, where he met Gandhi to discuss "routine military exercises of the Indian army" on the borders of [[Rajasthan]] and [[Punjab, India|Punjab]].  Gandhi reciprocated , in December 1988, by visiting [[Islamabad]] and meeting the new Prime Minister  of Pakistan, [[Benazir Bhutto]], to reaffirm the [[1972 Shimla agreement]].&lt;ref name="Sharma, p. 16"&gt;Sharma, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sri Lanka====
{{See also|Sri Lankan civil war|Indian intervention in the Sri Lankan Civil War}}
The [[Sri Lankan Civil War]] broke out with the [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]] (LTTE), which was demanding an independent [[Tamil people|Tamil]] state in Sri Lanka. Gandhi discussed the matter with the Sri Lankan Prime Minister [[Ranasinghe Premadasa]] at the [[SAARC]] meeting in 1986. In that year, the Sri Lankan army blockaded the Tamil majority district of [[Jaffna District|Jaffna]]; Gandhi ordered relief supplies to be dropped into the area by parachute because the Sri Lankan navy did not allow the [[Indian Navy]] to enter.&lt;ref&gt;Sharma, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

Gandhi signed the [[Indo-Sri Lanka Accord]] in July 1987. The accord "envisaged a devolution of power to the Tamil-majority areas", dissolved the LTTE, and designated [[Tamil language|Tamil]] as an official language of Sri Lanka.&lt;ref name="SL"/&gt; Gandhi said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Government of India believe that, despite some problems and delays, many of which were foreseen but unavoidable in the resolution of an issue of this magnitude and complexity, this Agreement represents the only way of safeguarding legitimate Tamil interests and ensuring a durable peace in Sri Lanka. Some have chosen to criticise the Agreement. None has shown a better way of meeting the legitimate aspirations of the Tamils in Sri Lanka, restoring peace in that country and of meeting our own security concern in the region. We have accepted a role which is difficult, but which is in our national interests to discharge. We shall not shrink our obligations and commitments. This is a national endeavour.&lt;ref name="SL"&gt;Sharma, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, the LTTE refused to give up violence and used propaganda against India, threatening Tamils opposed to its cause. In 1987, Gandhi sent the [[Indian Peace Keeping Force]] (IPKF) to protect civilians and to apprehend anyone carrying arms. The IPKF was attacked by LTTE, which led to the former disarming the latter. Gandhi withdrew the IPKF in 1989.&lt;ref name="Sharma, p. 16"/&gt;

====Assault by Sri Lankan guard====
On 30 July 1987, a day after Gandhi went to Sri Lanka and signed the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord, an honour guard named [[Vijitha Rohana]] hit him on his shoulder with his rifle; Gandhi's quick reflexes saved him from injury. The guard was then dragged off by his security personnel.&lt;ref name="NIE"&gt;{{cite web|title=No regrets for attack on Rajiv, says Lankan guard|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/world/No-regrets-for-attack-on-Rajiv-says-Lankan-guard/2013/07/30/article1708707.ece|publisher=New Indian Express|accessdate=26 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="injure"/&gt; The guard said his intention was to kill Gandhi because of "the damage he had caused" to Sri Lanka. Wijemuni was imprisoned for two-and-a-half years for the assault.&lt;ref name="NIE"/&gt; Gandhi later said about the incident:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When I was inspecting the guard of honour and as I walked past one person, I saw through the corner of my eye some movement. I ducked down a little bit in a reflex action. By my ducking, he missed my head and the brunt of the blow came on my shoulder below the left ear.&lt;ref name="injure"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sri Lankan in Honour Guard Attacks Gandhi|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-07-30/news/mn-453_1_sri-lankan|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=26 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Regional issues===
[[File:Bajaj-Polar-3.jpg|thumb|right|Rajiv Gandhi (left) congratulates Indian Army explorers for reaching the South Pole.]]

====Punjab====
Soon after assuming office, Gandhi released the leaders of the [[Akali Dal]] who had been imprisoned since 1984's Operation Blue Star during Indira Gandhi's prime ministership. He lifted the ban on [[All India Sikh Students Federation]] and filed an inquiry into the [[1984 Anti-Sikh Riots]]. He also held a closed-door meeting with senior Akali Dal leaders to find a solution to the Punjab problem. Despite Akali opposition, in January 1985, Gandhi signed the [[Rajiv-Longowal Accord]] with Akali leader HS Longowal. Punjab's state assembly election was scheduled in September 1985, but Longowal died and was replaced by [[Surjit Singh Barnala]], who formed the government. After two years, in 1987, Barnala resigned his office because of a breakdown of law and order, leading to the implementation of [[President's rule]] in the state.&lt;ref&gt;Sharma, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1988, Gandhi launched the [[Operation Black Thunder]] to clear the Golden Temple in [[Amritsar]] of arms and gunmen. Two groups called National Security Guard and Special Action Group were created; they surrounded the temple in a 10-day siege during which the extremists' weapons were confiscated. Congress leader [[Anand Sharma]] said, "Operation Black Thunder effectively demonstrated the will of Rajiv Gandhi's government to take firm action to bring peace to Punjab".&lt;ref&gt;Sharma, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

====Northeast India====
Gandhi's prime-ministership marked an increase of [[Insurgency in Northeast India|insurgency in northeast India]]. [[Mizo National Front]] demanded independence for [[Mizoram]]. In 1987, Gandhi addressed this problem; Mizoram and [[Arunachal Pradesh]] were given the status of states that were earlier union territories.&lt;ref&gt;Sharma, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Gandhi also ended the [[Assam Movement]], which was launched by Assamese people to protest against the alleged illegal migration of Bangladeshi Muslims and immigration of other Bengalis to their state, which had reduced the Assamese to a minority there. He signed the [[Assam Accord]] on 15 August 1985. According to the accord, foreigners who came to the state between 1951 and 1961 were given full citizenship but those who arrived there between 1961 and 1971 did not get right to vote for the next ten years.&lt;ref&gt;Sharma, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technology===
Gandhi employed former [[Rockwell International]] executive [[Sam Pitroda]] as his adviser on public information infrastructure and innovation. During Gandhi's time in office, public sector telecom companies [[MTNL]] and [[VSNL]] was developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Marcus F. Franda|title=China and India Online: Information Technology Politics and Diplomacy in the|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=9780742519466|page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Pitroda, Gandhi's ability to resist pressure from multi-national companies to abandon his plan to spread telecommunication services has been an important factor in India's development. According to news website [[Oneindia]], "About 20 years ago telephones were considered to be a thing for the use of the rich, but credit goes to Rajiv Gandhi for taking them to the rural masses".&lt;ref name="RG"&gt;{{cite web|title=Telecom revolution driving development; credit to Rajiv|url=http://www.oneindia.com/2007/01/18/telecom-revolution-driving-development-credit-to-rajiv-pitroda-1169113386.html|publisher=One India|accessdate=26 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pitroda also said their plan to expand India's telephone network succeeded because of Gandhi's political support. According to Pitroda, by 2007 they were "adding six million phones every month".&lt;ref name="RG"/&gt; Gandhi's government also allowed the import of fully assembled motherboards, which led to the price of computers being reduced.&lt;ref name="tel"/&gt; According to some commentators,  the seed for the information technology (IT) revolution was also planted during Rajiv Gandhi's time.&lt;ref name="tel"&gt;{{cite web|title=Economic Milestone: Ushering in Telecom Reforms (1985)|url=http://forbesindia.com/article/independence-day-special/economic-milestone-ushering-in-telecom-reforms-(1985)/38441/1?utm=slidebox|publisher=Forbes India|accessdate=26 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bofors scandal and 1989 elections defeat===
{{Main|Bofors scandal}}

Rajiv Gandhi's finance minister, [[V. P. Singh]], uncovered compromising details about government and political corruption, to the consternation of Congress leaders. Transferred to the Defence Ministry, Singh uncovered what became known as the Bofors scandal, which involved millions of US dollars and concerned alleged payoffs by the Swedish arms company [[Bofors]] through Italian businessman and Gandhi family associate [[Ottavio Quattrocchi]], in return for Indian contracts. Upon discovering the scandal, Singh was dismissed from office and later resigned his Congress membership. Gandhi was later personally implicated in the scandal when the investigation was continued by [[Narasimhan Ram]] and Chitra Subramaniam of ''[[The Hindu]]'' newspaper, damaging his image as an honest politician. In 2004, he was posthumously cleared of this allegation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/3458319.stm |title=Rajiv Gandhi cleared over bribery |publisher=BBC News  |date=4 February 2004 |accessdate=7 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book, ''Unknown Facets of Rajiv Gandhi, Jyoti Basu and Indrajit Gupta'', released in November 2013, former [[Central Bureau of Investigation|CBI]] director Dr. A P Mukherjee wrote that Gandhi wanted commission paid by defence suppliers to be used exclusively for meeting running expenses of the Congress party.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indianexpress.com/news/rajiv-gandhi-told-me-to-use-arms-deal-payoffs-for-party-funds-excbi-chief/1194313/ Rajiv Gandhi told me to use arms deal payoffs for party funds: Ex-CBI chief].

Opposition parties Lok Dal, [[Indian National Congress (Socialist)]] and [[Jan Morcha]] united under Singh to form the [[Janata Dal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Janata Parivar: Can 'socialist' Mulayam and co stop the Modi wave?|url=http://m.firstpost.com/politics/janata-parivar-can-socialist-mulayam-and-co-stop-the-modi-wave-1835149.html|publisher=First Post|accessdate=26 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singh led the [[National Front (India)|National Front]] coalition to victory in [[Indian general election, 1989|1989 elections]] and he was sworn in as Prime Minister. Though the coalition won 143 seats compared to Congress's 197, it gained majority in the lower house of the parliament through outside support from the [[Bharatiya Janta Party]] under the leadership of [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]] and [[Lal Krishna Advani]] and the left parties such as the [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)]] and the [[Communist Party of India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Lok Sabha elections|url=http://www.smetimes.in/smetimes/general-elections-2009/miscellaneous/2009/Mar/23/history-of-lok-sabha-elections5584.html|publisher=SME Times|accessdate=26 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eminent lawyer and politician, former [[Ministry of Law and Justice (India)|Law Minister of India]] [[Ram Jethmalani]] said that as Prime Minister, Gandhi was "lacklustre and mediocre".&lt;ref name="medio"/&gt;

==Later years==

===Allegations of black money===
In November 1991, ''[[Schweizer Illustrierte]]'' magazine published an article on [[black money]] held in secret accounts by [[Imelda Marcos]] and 14 other rulers of Third World countries. Citing [[McKinsey &amp; Company|McKinsey]] as a source, the article stated that Rajiv Gandhi held 2.5 billion [[Swiss franc]]s in secret Indian accounts in Switzerland.&lt;ref name="jethmalani"&gt;{{cite web |last=Jethmalani | first=Ram |url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/dacoits+have+looted+india/1/123602.html|title=Dacoits have looted India|date=17 December 2010|publisher=India Today|accessdate=30 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gisler 38–41"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gisler|first=Daniela|date=11 November 1991|title=Fluchtgelder – Die Schweizer Konten der Diktatoren|trans-title=Flight capital – the Swiss accounts of the dictators|journal=Schweizer Illustrierte|language=German|publisher=Ringier AG|location=Zürich, Switzerland|issue=46|pages=38–41|url=http://www.schweizer-illustrierte.ch/sites/default/files/SI-46-1991-Seiten-38-41.pdf|accessdate=30 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several leaders of opposition parties in India have raised the issue, citing the Schweizer Illustrierte article. In December 1991, Amal Datta raised the issue in the Indian Parliament; the Speaker of the Lok Sabha, [[Shivraj Patil]], expunged Rajiv Gandhi's name from the proceedings.&lt;ref name="gurumurthy"/&gt; In December 2011, [[Subramanian Swamy]] wrote to the director of the Central Bureau of Investigation, citing the article and asking him to take action on black money accounts of the [[Nehru–Gandhi family|Nehru-Gandhi family]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=7 December 2011 |url=http://www.moneylife.in/article/dr-subramanian-swamy-asks-cbi-to-take-action-on-gandhi-familys-black-money-accounts/22045.html |title=Dr Subramanian Swamy asks CBI to take action on Rajiv Gandhi's family's black money accounts|work=Moneylife|accessdate=30 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 December 2011, Ram Jethmalani made an indirect reference to the issue in the [[Rajya Sabha]], calling it a shame that one of India's former Prime Ministers was named by a Swiss magazine. This was met by uproar and a demand for withdrawal of the remark by the ruling Congress party members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=29 December 2011 |url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/lokpal-bill-debate-in-rajya-sabha-ram-jethmalani/1/166383.html |title=Lokpal debate: Ram Jethmalani creates ruckus in Rajya Sabha|work=India Today|accessdate=30 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Funding from KGB===
In 1992, the Indian newspapers ''[[Times of India]]'' and ''The Hindu'' published reports alleging that Rajiv Gandhi had received funds from the [[KGB]].&lt;ref name="gurumurthy"&gt;{{cite web |last=Gurumurthy | first=S |url=http://newindianexpress.com/opinion/article402584.ece|title=Zero tolerance, secret billions|date=30 January 2011|work=The New Indian Express |accessdate=30 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian government confirmed this disclosure and defended the payments as necessary for Soviet ideological interest.&lt;ref name="puri"/&gt; In their 1994 book ''The State Within a State'', journalists [[Yevgenia Albats]] and [[Catherine A.

==Assassination==
{{Main|Assassination of Rajiv Gandhi}}

Rajiv Gandhi's last public meeting was on 21 May 1991, at [[Sriperumbudur]], a village approximately {{Convert|40|km|miles|abbr=on}} from [[Madras]], where he was assassinated while campaigning for the Sriperumbudur Lok Sabha Congress candidate. At 10:10&amp;nbsp;pm, a woman later identified as [[Thenmozhi Rajaratnam]], approached Gandhi in public and greeted him.

The Supreme Court judgement, by Justice [[K. T. Thomas (Justice)|K. T. Thomas]], confirmed that Gandhi was killed because of personal animosity by the LTTE chief [[Velupillai Prabhakaran|Prabhakaran]] arising from his sending the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) to Sri Lanka and the alleged IPKF atrocities against Sri Lankan Tamils.&lt;ref&gt;''State of Tamil Nadu through Superintendent of Police, CBI/SIT vs. Nalini &amp; 25 Ors.'', Death Ref.

In the [[Jain Commission]] report, various people and agencies are named as suspects in the murder of Rajiv Gandhi.

The report of the Jain Commission created controversy when it accused the [[Tamil Nadu]] chief minister [[Karunanidhi]] of a role in the assassination, leading to Congress withdrawing its support for the [[I. K. Gujral]] government and fresh elections in 1998. LTTE spokesman [[Anton Balasingham]] told the Indian television channel [[NDTV]] the killing was a "great tragedy, a monumental historical tragedy which we deeply regret".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=70062 |title=We deeply regret Rajiv's death: LTTE |work=The Indian Express    |date=27 June 2006 |accessdate=7 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/5122032.stm |title=Tamil Tiger 'regret' over Gandhi |publisher=BBC News  |date=27 June 2006 |accessdate=7 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A memorial called [[Raj Ghat and other memorials|Veer Bhumi]] was constructed at the place of Gandhi's cremation in Delhi.
