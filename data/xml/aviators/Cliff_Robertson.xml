'''Clifford Parker Robertson III''' (September 9, 1923 – September 10, 2011) was an American actor with a film and television career that spanned half a century. Robertson portrayed a young [[John F. Kennedy]] in the 1963 film ''[[PT 109 (film)|PT 109]]'', and won the 1968 [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] for his role in the movie ''[[Charly]]''. On television, he portrayed retired astronaut [[Buzz Aldrin]] in the 1976 adaptation of Aldrin's autobiographic ''Return to Earth'', played a fictional character based on [[Director of Central Intelligence]] [[Richard Helms]] in the 1977 miniseries ''[[Washington: Behind Closed Doors]]'', and portrayed [[Henry Ford]] in the 1987 ''Ford: The Man and the Machine''. His last well-known film appearances were from 2002–2007 as [[Uncle Ben]] in the [[Spider-Man in film|''Spider-Man'' film trilogy]].

==Early life and education==
Robertson was born in [[La Jolla, California]],&lt;ref name="Times Obit" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/news/ni15215258/ IMDb]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Birth Index"&gt;[http://www.familytreelegends.com/records/39461?c=search&amp;first=clifford%20parker&amp;last=robertson California Births, 1905–1995] ''Familytreelegends.com''&lt;/ref&gt; the son of Clifford Parker Robertson Jr. (1902–1968), and his first wife, Audrey Olga Robertson (''[[née]]'' Willingham; 1903–1925).&lt;ref&gt;Several obituaries have stated that Robertson was adopted by his parents. However, the California Birth Index of 1905–1995 states that Clifford P. Robertson was born to a mother whose maiden name was Willingham, in [[Los Angeles County]], California, on September 9, 1923.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mother's birth and death information per records accessed on ancestry.com on September 12, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  His [[Texas]]-born father was described as "the idle heir to a tidy sum of ranching money".&lt;ref&gt;Father's birthplace accessed on ancestry.com on September 12, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Robertson once said, "[My father] was a very romantic figure – tall, handsome. He married four or five times, and between marriages he'd pop in to see me. He was a great raconteur, and he was always surrounded by psychopaths who let him pick up the tab. During the Depression, he tapped the trust for $500,000, and six months later he was back for more."&lt;ref name=Mag&gt;{{cite web|last=Green|first=Michelle|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20086490,00.html|title=Cliff Robertson profile at|work=People|date=December 5, 1983|accessdate=November 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robertson's parents divorced when he was one, and his mother died of [[peritonitis]] a year later in [[El Paso, Texas]], at the age of 21.&lt;ref name="Times Obit"&gt;{{cite news|last=Keepnews|first=Peter|title=Cliff Robertson, Oscar-Winning Rebel, Dies at 88|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/11/movies/cliff-robertson-oscar-winning-rebel-dies-at-88.html|accessdate=September 11, 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mag/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mother's death information per records accessed on ancestry.com on September 12, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; He was raised by his maternal grandmother, Mary Eleanor "Eleanora" Willingham (''née'' Sawyer, 1875–1957), in [[California]], and rarely saw his father.&lt;ref name="Times Obit"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mag/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grandmother's name and dates accessed on ancestry.com on September 12, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated in 1941 from [[La Jolla High School]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmreference.com/Actors-and-Actresses-Ro-Sc/Robertson-Cliff.html Cliff Robertson biodata], FilmReference.com; accessed April 26, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; where he was known as "The Walking Phoenix".&lt;ref name="Walk of Fame"&gt;{{cite web|last=|title=Cliff Robertson/Hollywood Walk of Fame|url=http://www.walkoffame.com/cliff-robertson|publisher=Hollywood Chamber of Commerce|accessdate=September 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He served in the [[United States Merchant Marine|U.S. Merchant Marine]] in [[World War II]],&lt;ref name="Times Obit"/&gt; before attending [[Antioch College]] in [[Yellow Springs, Ohio]], and dropping out to work as a journalist for a short time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmreference.com/Actors-and-Actresses-Ro-Sc/Robertson-Cliff.html "Cliff Robertson"].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="yahoo"&gt;[https://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800029948/bio Cliff Robertson biodata], yahoo.com; accessed April 26, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Robertson studied at the [[Actors Studio]], becoming a life member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|quote=|first=David |last=Garfield|title=A Player's Place: The Story of The Actors Studio|year=1980|publisher=MacMillan Publishing Co., Inc.|location=New York|isbn=0-02-542650-8|page=278|chapter=Appendix: Life Members of The Actors Studio as of January 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the early 50s he worked steadily on television, including a stint in the lead of ''[[Rod Brown of the Rocket Rangers]]'' (1953–54). He appeared in Broadway in ''Late Love'' (1953–54) and ''The Wisteria Tree'' (1955), the latter written by [[Joshua Logan]].

===Columbia===
Robertson made his film debut in ''[[Picnic (1955 film)|Picnic]]'' (1955), directed by Logan. Robertson played the role of [[William Holden]]'s best friend - a part originated on stage by [[Paul Newman]].

The film was a big hit and Robertson was promoted to [[Joan Crawford]]'s co star in ''[[Autumn Leaves (film)|Autumn Leaves]]'' (1956), also at Columbia, playing her mentally unstable younger lover. This meant he had to pass up the chance to replace [[Ben Gazzara]] on Broadway in ''[[Cat on a Hot Tin Roof]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Schallert, E. (1955, Aug 18).

Los Angeles Times (1923-Current File) Retrieved from https://search-proquest-com.ezproxy.sl.nsw.gov.au/docview/166816412?accountid=13902&lt;/ref&gt; However he did return to Broadway to appear in ''[[Orpheus Descending]]'' by [[Tennessee Williams]], which only had a short run.

Robertson went to RKO to make two movies: ''[[The Naked and the Dead (film)|The Naked and the Dead]]'' (1958), an adaptation of the famous novel, co-starring [[Aldo Ray]]; and ''[[The Girl Most Likely]]'' (1958), a musical - the last film made by RKO Studios.  Robertson received superb reviews for ''[[Days of Wine and Roses (Playhouse 90)|Days of Wine and Roses]]'' on TV with [[Piper Laurie]].

He was in Columbia's ''[[Gidget (film)|Gidget]]'' (1959) appearing opposite [[Sandra Dee]] as the Big [[Kahuna]]. It was popular and led to two sequels, neither of which Robertson appeared in. Less successful was a war film at Columbia, ''[[Battle of the Coral Sea (film)|Battle of the Coral Sea]]'' (1959).

Robertson had better luck on TV, appearing in the excellent "[[A Hundred Yards Over the Rim]]" for ''The Twilight Zone''. He was third lead in Paramount's ''[[All in a Night's Work (film)|All in a Night's Work]]'' (1961) and starred in [[Samuel Fuller]]'s ''[[Underworld U.S.A.]]'' (1961) at Columbia. 

Robertson supported [[Esther Williams]] in ''[[The Big Show (1961 film)|The Big Show]]'' (1961). He had his first film hit since ''Gidget'' with Columbia's ''[[The Interns (film)|The Interns]]'' (1962). After supporting [[Debbie Reynolds]] in ''[[My Six Loves]]'' (1963), Robertson was President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s personal choice to play him in 1963's ''[[PT 109 (film)|PT 109]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Hoberman, J. |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/news/0335,hoberman,46558,1.html |title=Lights, Camera, Exploitation |work=Village Voice |date=August 26, 2003 |accessdate=November 25, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080630070747/http://www.villagevoice.com/news/0335%2Choberman%2C46558%2C1.html |archivedate=June 30, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was not a success at the box office.

More popular was ''[[Sunday in New York]]'' (1963), where Robertson supported [[Rod Taylor]] and [[Jane Fonda]], and ''[[The Best Man (1964 film)|The Best Man]]'' where he was a ruthless presidential candidate. 

Robertson appeared in a popular war film ''[[633 Squadron]]'' (1964) then supported [[Lana Turner]] in a melodrama, ''[[Love Has Many Faces]]'' (1965). In 1965 he said his contract with Columbia was for one film a year.&lt;ref&gt;Hopper, H. (1965, Aug 08). Cliff robertson: Career that's flying high. Los Angeles Times (1923-Current File) Retrieved from https://search-proquest-com.ezproxy.sl.nsw.gov.au/docview/155264948?accountid=13902&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Charly''===
Frustrated at the progress of his career, Robertson optioned the rights to a TV play he had appeared in, ''[[Flowers for Algernon]]''. He hired [[William Goldman]] to write a script. Before Goldman completed his work, Robertson arranged for Goldman to be hired to Americanize the dialogue for ''[[Masquerade (1965 film)|Masquerade]]'' (1965), a spy spoof which Robertson starred in, replacing [[Rex Harrison]].

Robertson then made a war film, ''[[Up from the Beach]]'' (1965) for Fox and guest starred on that studio's TV show, ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' (1966). He co-starred with Harrison in ''[[The Honey Pot]]'' (1967) for [[Joseph Manckiewicz]] then was in another war movie, ''[[The Devil's Brigade (film)|The Devil's Brigade]]'' (1968) with [[William Holden]].

Robertson disliked Goldman's ''Algernon'' script and replaced the writer with [[Stirling Silliphant]] for what became ''[[Charly]]'' (1968). The film was a big hit and Robertson won the [[Academy Award for Best Actor#1960s|1968 Academy Award for Best Actor]] for his portrayal of a mentally disabled man.

===Stardom===
''Charly'' was made by ABC Pictures who insisted [[Robert Aldrich]] use him in ''[[Too Late the Hero (film)|Too Late the Hero]]'' (1970), a war film with [[Michael Caine]] that disappointed at the box office. 

He turned down roles in ''[[The Anderson Tapes]]'', ''[[Straw Dogs (1971 film)|Straw Dogs]]'' (before Peckinpah was involved) and ''[[Dirty Harry]]''.&lt;ref name="coop"/&gt; Instead Robertson co-wrote, starred in and directed ''[[J. W. Coop]]'' (1972), another commercial disappointment despite excellent reviews. Looking back on his career he said "nobody made more mediocre movies than I did. Nobody ever did such a wide variety of mediocrity."&lt;ref name="coop"&gt;By, A. H. (1972, Jul 16). Cliff robertson flies the 'coop' to glory. New York Times (1923-Current File) Retrieved from https://search-proquest-com.ezproxy.sl.nsw.gov.au/docview/119540258?accountid=13902&lt;/ref&gt;

He was [[Cole Younger]] in ''[[The Great Northfield Minnesota Raid]]'' (1972) and played a pilot in ''[[Ace Eli and Rodger of the Skies]]'' (1973). He was in a thriller ''[[Man on a Swing]]'' (1974) and British drama ''[[Out of Season (film)|Out of Season]]'' (1975).

===Career decline===
Robertson returned to supporting parts in ''[[Three Days of the Condor]]'' (1975), a big hit. He did play the lead in ''[[Obsession (1976 film)|Obsession]]'' (1976), a popular thriller from [[Brian De Palma]] and [[Paul Schrader]], and ''[[Shoot (film)|Shoot]]'' (1976) a Canadian drama. He was one of several stars in ''[[Midway (film)|Midway]]'' (1976).

Robertson turned to television for ''[[Washington: Behind Closed Doors]]'' (1977) then had the lead in a thriller, ''[[Dominique (1978 film)|Dominique]]'' (1978). He returned to directing for ''[[The Pilot (film)|The Pilot]]'' (1980), also playing the title role, an alcoholic flyer. Robertson played [[Hugh Hefner]] in ''[[Star 80]]'' (1980). He attempted to make ''[[Charly II]]'' in 1980 but it did not happen.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce McCabe, G. S. (1980, Sep 08). CLIFF ROBERTSON BRINGING CHARLY BACK TO SOUTH BOSTON.

He commented on his website: "Since ''Spider-Man 1'' and ''2'', I seem to have a whole new generation of fans. That in itself is a fine residual."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cliffrobertson.info/career.htm "Cliff Robertson's Career Achievements"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006110034/http://cliffrobertson.info/career.htm |date=2011-10-06 }}.

===Young Eagles initiative===
A certified private pilot, he was a longtime member of the [[Experimental Aircraft Association]] (EAA), working his way through the ranks in prominence and eventually co-founding the [[Young Eagles|Young Eagles Program]] with EAA president [[Tom Poberezny]]. Robertson chaired the program from its 1992 inception to 1994 (succeeded by former test pilot [[Chuck Yeager|Gen. Chuck Yeager]]). Along with educating youth around aviation, the initial goal of the Young Eagles was to fly one million children (many of them never having flown before) prior to the 100th Anniversary of Flight celebration on December 17, 2003. That goal was achieved on November 13, 2003. On July 28, 2016, the two millionth Young Eagle was flown by actor [[Harrison Ford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Harrison Ford Flies 2 Millionth Young Eagle|url=http://www.eaa.org/en/airventure/eaa-airventure-news-and-multimedia/eaa-airventure-news/eaa-airventure-oshkosh/07-27-2016-2-millionth-young-eagle-flies-today|accessdate= 25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Columbia Pictures scandal==
In 1977, Robertson discovered that his signature had been forged on a $10,000 check payable to him, although it was for work he had not performed. He also learned that the forgery had been carried out by [[Columbia Pictures]] head [[David Begelman]], and on reporting it he inadvertently triggered one of the biggest Hollywood scandals of the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cliff Robertson|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/film-obituaries/8756059/Cliff-Robertson.html|newspaper=The Telegraph|location=London|date= September 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Begelman was charged with [[embezzlement]], convicted, and later fired from Columbia. Despite pressure to remain quiet, Robertson and his wife [[Dina Merrill]] spoke to the press. As a result, Hollywood producers blacklisted him.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, G. (1980, Mar 28).

He finally returned to studio film five years later, starring in ''[[Brainstorm (1983 film)|Brainstorm]]'' (1983).&lt;ref name="yahoo"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McClintick, David. ''Indecent Exposure: A True Story of Hollywood and Wall Street'', [[William Morrow and Company]], 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; The story of the scandal is told in David McClintick's 1982 bestseller ''Indecent Exposure''.

Rumbough Jr.]]; they had a daughter, Heather (1969–2007), before divorcing.&lt;ref name="Times Obit"/&gt; By this marriage, he also had stepchildren Stanley Hutton Rumbough, David Post Rumbough, and Nedenia Colgate Rumbough.

===Aviation===

As a 13-year-old he would clean hangars for airplane rides. He met [[Paul Mantz]], [[Art Scholl]], and [[Charles Lindbergh]] while flying at local California airports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|magazine=Air Progress|date=December 1987|title=Real Airport Kids Never Grow Up|author=Gene Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt; His piloting skills helped him get the part as the squadron leader in the British war film ''[[633 Squadron]]''. He entered balloon races, including one in 1964 from the mainland to [[Santa Catalina Island, California|Catalina Island]] that ended with him being rescued from the Pacific Ocean. 

In 1969, during the [[Nigerian Civil War|civil war conflict in Nigeria]], Robertson helped organize an effort to fly food and medical supplies into the area. He also organized flights of supplies to the ravaged country of [[Ethiopia]] when it experienced famine in 1978.&lt;ref name=go-star/&gt; Within the [[Experimental Aircraft Association|EAA]], he founded the Cliff Robertson Work Experience in 1993, which offers youths the chance to work for flight and ground school instruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eaa.org/en/eaa/aviation-education-and-resources/eaa-youth-education/eaa-internships-and-work-study-programs/eaa-air-academy-internships/cliff-robertson-work-experience-for-ages-16-17|title=Cliff Robertson Work Experience|accessdate= 9 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Robertson was flying a private [[Beechcraft Baron]] over New York City on the morning of [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001]]. He was directly above the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] climbing through 7,500 feet when the [[American Airlines Flight 11|first Boeing 767]] struck. He was instructed by air traffic control to land immediately at the nearest airport after a nationwide order to ground all civilian and commercial aircraft following the attacks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cliffrobertson.info/aviation2.htm ''Official Cliff Robertson site''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002115148/http://www.cliffrobertson.info/aviation2.htm |date=2011-10-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
