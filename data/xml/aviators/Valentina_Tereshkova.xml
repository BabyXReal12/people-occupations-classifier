'''Valentina Vladimirovna Tereshkova''' ({{lang-rus|Валенти́на Влади́мировна Терешко́ва|p=vɐlʲɪnʲˈtʲinə vlɐˈdʲimʲɪrəvnə tʲɪrʲɪʂˈkovə|a=Valentina Tereshkova.ogg}}; born 6 March 1937) is a retired Russian [[cosmonaut]], [[engineer]], and politician. She is the [[List of female astronauts|first]] [[Women in space|woman to have flown in space]], having been selected from more than 400 applicants and five finalists to pilot [[Vostok 6]] on 16 June 1963. 

In order to join the Cosmonaut Corps, Tereshkova was honorarily inducted into the [[Soviet Air Force]] and thus she also became the first civilian to fly in space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yarregion.ru/eng/Pages/famous_people_Valentina_Vladimirovna_Tereshkova.aspx |title=Valentina Vladimirovna Tereshkova |work=Yaroslavl Region |year=2016 |accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before her recruitment as a cosmonaut, Tereshkova was a textile-factory assembly worker and an amateur [[skydiver]]. After the dissolution of the first group of female cosmonauts in 1969, she became a prominent member of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], holding various political offices. She remained politically active following the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]] and is regarded as a hero in post-Soviet Russia and much of the world. Having orbited Earth 48 times, Tereshkova remains the only woman ever to have been on a solo space mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rt.com/news/379550-tereshkova-facts-80-anniversary|title=8 surprising facts about stellar career of Valentina Tereshkova, the 1st woman in space|website=rt.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2017/mar/29/valentina-tereshkova-first-woman-in-space-people-waste-money-on-wars|title=The first woman in space: 'People shouldn’t waste money on wars'|first=Mary|last=Dejevsky|date=29 March 2017|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, she offered to go on a one-way trip to [[Mars]] if the opportunity arose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.news.com.au/technology/science/first-female-astronaut-valentina-tereshkovas-mars-plan/story-fn5fsgyc-1226660740625#ixzz2XWZKQD1c |title=First female astronaut Valentina Tereshkova wants one-way Mars ticket |work=[[News.com.au]] |date=9 June 2013 |accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Tereshkova was born in the village of [[Bolshoye Maslennikovo|Maslennikovo]] in [[Tutayevsky District]], [[Yaroslavl Oblast]], in central Russia. Her parents had migrated from [[Belarus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nn.by/?c=ar&amp;i=25785 |title=Першая жанчына‑касманаўт ў дзяцінстве гаварыла па‑беларуску |trans-title=The first woman in space spoke Belarusian as a child |work=[[Nasha Niva]] |date=24 April 2009 |accessdate=3 April 2016 |language=Belarusian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tereshkova's father was a tractor driver and her mother worked in a textile plant. Tereshkova went to school in 1945 at the age 8; however, she left school in 1953 at 16 and continued her education by correspondence courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/whos_who_level2/tereshkova.html |title=Valentina Tereshkova |work=StarChild: NASA Goddard Space Flight Center |year=2016 |accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She became interested in parachuting from a young age, and trained in [[skydiving]] at the local Aeroclub, making her first jump at age 22 on 21 May 1959; at the time, she was employed as a textile worker in a local factory. It was her expertise in skydiving that led to her selection as a cosmonaut. In 1961, she became Secretary of the local [[Komsomol]] (Young Communist League) and later joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbRxuvmiXKY |title=President Vladimir Putin of Russia Congratulates Valentina Tereshkova, First Woman In Space on 80th Birthday  |website=YouTube.com |publisher=''Russia Today'' |date=6 March 2017 |accessdate=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career in the Soviet space program==
[[File:RIAN archive 619144 Cosmonauts Valentina Tereshkova and Valery Bykovsky among children.jpg|thumb|left|Cosmonauts Valentina Tereshkova and [[Valery Bykovsky]] among children]]
After the flight of [[Yuri Gagarin]] in 1961, [[Sergey Korolyov]], the chief Soviet rocket engineer, came up with the idea of putting a woman in space. On 16 February 1962, Valentina Tereshkova was selected to join the female cosmonaut corps. Out of more than 400 applicants, five were selected: [[Tatyana Kuznetsova]], [[Irina Solovyova]], [[Zhanna Yorkina]], [[Valentina Ponomaryova]], and Tereshkova. Qualifications included that they be parachutists under 30 years of age, under {{Convert|170|cm|ftin|abbr=on}} tall, and under {{Convert|70|kg|lb|abbr=on|0}} in weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-34270395 |title=Valentina Tereshkova: USSR was 'worried' about women in space |first=Pallab |last=Ghosh |work=[[BBC News]] |date=17 September 2015 |accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tereshkova was considered a particularly worthy candidate, partly due to her "[[proletarian]]" background, and because her father, tank leader [[sergeant]] Vladimir Tereshkov, was a [[war hero]]. He died in the Finnish [[Winter War]] during World War II in the [[Lemetti]] area in Finnish [[Karelia]] when Tereshkova was two years old. After her mission, she was asked how the [[Soviet Union]] should thank her for her service to the country. Tereshkova asked that the government search for, and publish, the location where her father was [[killed in action]]. This was done, and a monument now stands at the site in Lemetti—now on the Russian side of the border. Tereshkova has since visited Finland several times.

Training included weightless flights, isolation tests, centrifuge tests, rocket theory, spacecraft engineering, 120 parachute jumps and pilot training in [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15|MiG-15UTI]] jet fighters. The group spent several months in intensive training, concluding with examinations in November 1962, after which four remaining candidates were commissioned Junior Lieutenants in the Soviet Air Force. Tereshkova, Solovyova and Ponomaryova were the leading candidates, and a joint mission profile was developed that would see two women launched into space, on solo Vostok flights on consecutive days in March or April 1963.&lt;ref name="earthmagazine"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.earthmagazine.org/article/benchmarks-june-16-1963-june-18-1983-valentina-tereshkova-and-sally-ride-become-first-and |first=Megan |last=Sever |title=June 16, 1963 &amp; June 18, 1983: Valentina Tereshkova and Sally Ride Become First and Third Women in Space |journal=[[Earth (magazine)|Earth]] |date=June 2014 |volume=59 |issue=6 |pages=60–61 |accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally it was intended that Tereshkova would launch first in Vostok 5 while Ponomaryova would follow her into orbit in Vostok 6. However, this flight plan was altered in March 1963. Vostok 5 would now carry a male cosmonaut [[Valery Bykovsky]] flying the joint mission with a woman aboard Vostok 6 in June 1963. The State Space Commission nominated Tereshkova to pilot Vostok 6 at their meeting on 21 May and this was confirmed by [[Nikita Khrushchev]] himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Colin |last1=Burgis |first2=Bert |last2=Vis |title=Interkosmos: The Eastern Bloc's Early Space Program |publisher=Springer Paxis Books |year=2015 |isbn=978-3319241616}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tereshkova was exactly ten years younger than the youngest [[Mercury Seven]] astronaut, [[Gordon Cooper]].

After watching the successful launch of [[Vostok 5]] on 14 June, Tereshkova began final preparations for her own flight. She was 26 at the time. On the morning of 16 June 1963, Tereshkova and her backup Solovyova were both dressed in spacesuits and taken to the [[launch pad]] by bus. After completing her communication and life support checks, she was sealed inside the Vostok. After a two-hour countdown, [[Vostok 6]] launched faultlessly, and Tereshkova became the first woman in space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/space/11871598/Russia-forgot-to-send-toothbrush-with-first-woman-in-space.html |title=Russia forgot to send toothbrush with first woman in space  |first=Sarah |last=Knapton |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=17 September 2015 |accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her call sign in this flight was '''Chaika''' (English: [[Seagull]]; {{lang-ru|Ча́йка}}), later commemorated as the name of an asteroid, [[1671 Chaika]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Kelly |last=Knight |title=Earth calling Seagull |journal=[[Astronomy (magazine)|Astronomy]] |date=June 2003 |volume=31 |issue=6 |page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RIAN archive 159271 Nikita Khrushchev, Valentina Tereshkova, Pavel Popovich and Yury Gagarin at Lenin Mausoleum.jpg|thumb|left|From left to right: [[Yuri Gagarin]], [[Pavel Popovich]], Valentina Tereshkova, and [[Nikita Khrushchev]] at the [[Lenin Mausoleum]], during a celebration honoring the Soviet cosmonauts, 1963]]
Although Tereshkova experienced [[nausea]] and physical discomfort for much of the flight,&lt;ref name=rian&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ria.ru/review/20060616/49619382.html |title=Валентина Терешкова: чьей воле покорялась женщина, покорившая космос |trans-title=Valentina Tereshkova: the Woman who Conquered Space |work=[[RIA Novosti]] |date=16 June 2006 |accessdate=3 April 2016 |language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; she orbited the earth 48 times and spent almost three days in space. With a single flight, she logged more flight time than the combined times of all American astronauts who had flown before that date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/sep/17/first-woman-in-space-valentina-tereshkova |title=First woman in space recalls mission's teething troubles |first=Maev |last=Kennedy |work=The Guardian |date=17 September 2015 |accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tereshkova also maintained a flight log and took photographs of the horizon, which were later used to identify [[aerosol]] layers within the [[atmosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Valentina |last=Tereshkova |title=Three days in outer space |journal=[[The Saturday Evening Post]] |date=4 January 1964 |volume=237 |issue=1 |pages=62–63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vostok 6]] was the final Vostok flight and was launched two days after [[Vostok 5]] which carried [[Valery Bykovsky]] into a similar orbit for five days, landing three hours after Tereshkova. The two vessels approached each other within {{convert|5|km|mi|abbr=on}} at one point, and Tereshkova communicated with Bykovsky and with Khrushchev by radio.

Even though there were plans for further flights by women, it took 19 years until the second woman, [[Svetlana Savitskaya]], flew into space. None of the other four in Tereshkova's early group flew, and, in October 1969, the pioneering female cosmonaut group was dissolved.&lt;ref name="earthmagazine"/&gt;

In September 1963, Tereshkova donated a silver cup at the women's [[1963 European Rowing Championships (women)|1963 European Rowing Championships]] held in [[Khimki]] near Moscow for the most successful nation, which went to the team from the Soviet Union as they won gold in all five boat classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Fünf Europatitel für UdSSR-Ruderinnen |url= http://zefys.staatsbibliothek-berlin.de/ddr-presse/ergebnisanzeige/?purl=SNP2532889X-19630909-0-6-61-0 |accessdate=13 January 2018 |work=[[Neues Deutschland]] |volume=18 |issue=247 |date=9 September 1963 |page=6 | language=de |registration=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
[[File:RIAN archive 16350 Tereshkova, skiing.jpg|thumb|upright|Tereshkova, skiing, 1964]]
After her flight, Tereshkova studied at the [[ Zhukovsky Air Force Academy ]] and graduated with distinction as a cosmonaut engineer. In 1977 she earned a doctorate in engineering.

==Soviet political career==
Due to her prominence, Tereshkova was chosen for several political positions: from 1966 to 1974 she was a member of the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union]], from 1974 to 1989 a member of the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet]], and from 1969 to 1991 she was in the [[Central Committee of the CPSU|Central Committee of the Communist Party]]. In 1997, she was retired from the [[Russian Air Force]] and the cosmonaut corps by presidential order.

Beyond her recognized political offices within the Soviet Union, Tereshkova also became a well-known representative of the Soviet Union abroad. She was made a member of the [[World Peace Council]] in 1966, a member of the [[Yaroslavl Oblast|Yaroslavl]] Soviet in 1967. She was also the Soviet representative to the UN Conference for the [[International Women's Year]] in [[Mexico City]] in 1975. She also led the Soviet delegation to the World Conference on Women in Copenhagen and played a critical role in shaping the socialist women's global agenda for peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Ghodsee | first = Kristen | title = Rethinking State Socialist Mass Women's Organizations: The Committee of the Bulgarian Women's Movement and the United Nations Decade for Women, 1975-1985 | journal = [[Journal of Women's History]] | volume = 24 | issue = 4 | pages = 49&amp;ndash;73 | doi = 10.1353/jowh.2012.0044 | date = Winter 2012 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; She attained the rank of deputy to the Supreme Soviet, membership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union Central Committee, Vice President of the International Woman’s Democratic Federation and President of the Soviet-Algerian Friendship Society.

She was decorated with the [[Hero of the Soviet Union]] medal, the USSR's highest award. She was also awarded the [[Order of Lenin]], [[Order of the October Revolution]], numerous other medals, and foreign orders including the [[Karl Marx Order]], United Nations Gold Medal of Peace and the Simba International Women’s Movement Award. She was also bestowed a title of the [[Hero of Socialist Labor of Czechoslovakia]], [[Hero of Labor of Vietnam]], and [[Hero of Mongolia]]. In 1990 she received an honorary doctorate from the [[University of Edinburgh]]. [[Tereshkova (crater)|Tereshkova crater]] on the [[far side of the Moon]] was named after her.

==Post-Soviet political career==

After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Tereshkova lost her political office but none of her prestige. To this day, she is revered as a hero, and to some her importance in Russian space history is only surpassed by [[Yuri Gagarin]] and [[Alexey Leonov]]. She was elected to the [[State Duma]], the lower house of the Russian legislature, in 2011 as a member of [[United Russia]] where she continues to serve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.duma.gov.ru/structure/deputies/131193/ |title=Терешкова Валентина Владимировна |trans-title=Tereshkova, Valentina Vladimirovna |work=[[State Duma|The State Duma of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation]] |year=2016 |accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tereshkova's life and spaceflight were first written of in the West in the 1975 book: ''[[It Is I, Sea Gull; Valentina Tereshkova, the first woman in space]]'' by [[Mitchel R. Sharpe]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title="It is I, Sea gull;": Valentina Tereshkova, first woman in space |first=Mitchell R. |last=Sharpe |publisher=Crowell |year=1975 |isbn=978-0-690-00646-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then again in greater detail of her life and spaceflight in the 2007 book ''[[Into That Silent Sea]]'' by [[Colin Burgess (author)|Colin Burgess]] and [[Francis French]], including interviews with Tereshkova and her colleagues.

Tereshkova was invited to Prime Minister [[Vladimir Putin]]'s residence in [[Novo-Ogaryovo]] for the celebration of her 70th birthday. While there she said that she would like to fly to Mars, even if it meant that it was a one-way trip.&lt;ref name=Mars&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/scienceNews/idUSL0647601420070306 |title=First woman in space dreams of flying to Mars |work=[[Reuters]] |accessdate=26 May 2008 |date=6 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 April 2008, she was a torchbearer of the [[2008 Summer Olympics torch relay]] in [[Saint Petersburg]], Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.kp.ru/daily/24075/312208/ |title=Олимпийский огонь понесут Друзь, Фрейндлих и Плющенко |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=16 October 2012 |newspaper=[[Komsomolskaya Pravda]] |accessdate=4 March 2013 |language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She received the [[Eduard Rhein Ring of Honor]] from the German [[Eduard Rhein Foundation]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eduard-rhein-stiftung.de/html/Ehrenring_e.html |title=The Eduard Rhein Ring of Honor Recipients |work=[[Eduard Rhein Foundation]] |accessdate=5 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718234106/http://www.eduard-rhein-stiftung.de/html/Ehrenring_e.html |archivedate=18 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eduard-rhein-stiftung.de/html/2007/Ehrenring.html |title=Ring of Honor 2007 – Dr. techn.

On 8 June 1964, nearly one year after her space flight, she gave birth to their daughter Elena Andrianovna Nikolaeva-Tereshkova,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Feldman |first=Heather |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r_LHO5_AzwQC&amp;pg=PT24#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Valentina Tereshkova: The First Woman in Space |publisher=Rosen Publishing Group |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-8239-6246-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; who became a doctor and was the first person to have both a mother and father who had travelled into space. She and Nikolayev divorced in 1982. Her second husband, the orthopaedist Yuliy G. Shaposhnikov, died in 1999.

==In popular culture==
In 1997, London-based electronic pop group [[Komputer]] released a song entitled "Valentina" which gives a more-or-less direct account of her career as a cosmonaut. It was released as a single and appears on their album ''The World of Tomorrow''. The band [[Public Service Broadcasting (band)|Public Service Broadcasting]] has a song entitled "Valentina" on their 2015 album ''[[The Race for Space (album)|The Race for Space]]'' in tribute to her. In the same year, [[Findlay Napier]]'s album ''[[VIP: Very Interesting Persons]]'' included a song "Valentina", written in her honour by Napier and [[Boo Hewerdine]].

Tereshkova was featured in the 2003 made-for-television adaption of A Wrinkle in Time. She was portrayed by Apollonia Vanova 

In season three of ''[[Orange is the New Black]]'', Red describes Tereshkova as her hero, and notes her focus in wanting to travel to Mars, despite being in her seventies.

In 2015, a short film entitled ''Valentina's Dream'' was released by Meat Bingo Productions. The film stars [[Rebecca Front]] as Tereshkova and is based on an interview by the former cosmonaut where she expressed a desire to journey to Mars.

The 2007 video game ''[[Mass Effect]]'' included a fictional star system named for Tereshkova.&lt;ref name="Converse2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Cris Converse|title=Mass Effect Game Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G62qCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA60|date=3 March 2016|publisher=Booksmango|isbn=978-1-63323-677-6|pages=60–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Streets in Ukraine that bore Tereshkova's name have been renamed due to the country's [[decommunization in Ukraine|2015 decommunization law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{uk icon}} [http://pda.pravda.com.ua/news/id_7105274/ Muscovite renamed all the streets Valentina Tereshkova], [[Ukrayinska Pravda]] (12 April 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://z-news.link/the-scandal-with-the-renaming-in-odessa-the-city-council-gave-the-answer/|title=The scandal with the renaming in Odessa: the city Council gave the answer|website=z-news.link}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2015 space flight simulator ''[[Kerbal Space Program]]'' features a pilot Kerbal named Valentina in her honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|user=KerbalSpaceP|author=Kerbal Space Program|number=570181771133898752|date=24 February 2015|title=@xZise She's named after Valentina Tereshkova, the first woman in space.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2017 mobile RPG ''[[Alliance: Heroes of the Spire]]'' has a hero named "Valentina, the Star Pioneer" in honor of Tereshkova.

In 2017, Uruguayan electronic duo ''[[Corvis]]'' released a full album inspired by Valentina's courage, ''Krasnyy''. They specially made her a tribute naming "Chaika" to the most climatic and emotional track of the album.

The BBC drama ''[[Call the Midwife]]'' (Season 7, Episode 4; broadcast 11 February 2018) used the space flight of Tereshkova as an example of heroism by a woman.
