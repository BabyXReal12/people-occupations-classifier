'''Cory Fulton Lidle''' (March 22, 1972 – October 11, 2006) was an American [[professional baseball]] player. A [[right-handed]] [[pitcher]], Lidle spent nine seasons in [[Major League Baseball]] with seven different teams.  Lidle was killed when the small aircraft he owned [[2006 New York City plane crash|crashed into a residential building]] in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name = "mlb_death"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/news/article.jsp?ymd=20061011&amp;content_id=1708962&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=mlb|title=Yankees' Lidle killed in plane crash|website=Major League Baseball}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Baseball career==
===Early career: 1990–97===
Lidle graduated from [[South Hills High School (West Covina, California)|South Hills High School]] in [[West Covina, California]] in 1990 and was signed in 1990 by the [[Minnesota Twins]] as an amateur [[free agent]]. He was released in 1993 and spent a season playing for the unaffiliated [[Pocatello Posse]] in Idaho while tending bar.&lt;ref name="kepner"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kepner|first1=Tyler|title=Lidle Had Passion for Flying, And for Speaking His Mind|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/12/sports/baseball/12lidle.html|accessdate=19 January 2018|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=12 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; After one season in Pocatello, he was signed by the [[Milwaukee Brewers]]. Due to his participation as a [[replacement player]] during the [[1994 Major League Baseball strike]], he was ineligible to join the [[Major League Baseball Players Association]].&lt;ref name="kepner" /&gt; He was then traded in 1996 to the [[New York Mets]], with whom he made his major league debut on May 8, 1997.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

===Later career: 1999–2006===
Lidle later appeared for the [[Tampa Bay Rays|Tampa Bay Devil Rays]], [[Oakland Athletics]], [[Toronto Blue Jays]], [[Cincinnati Reds]], [[Philadelphia Phillies]] and [[New York Yankees]]. His best season was 2001, when he achieved a 13-6 record with a 3.59 ERA (10th in the American League) for Oakland, helping the Athletics win the [[wild card (sports)|wild card]]. His career zenith occurred in August 2002,{{citation needed|date=January 2010}} when he gave up only one [[run (baseball)|run]] during the whole month (setting Oakland's record for consecutive innings without an earned run), [[Win (baseball)|won]] all five of his starts, and was one of the prime movers in the A's historic run of 20 straight wins. It was on this Oakland team where he earned the nickname "Snacks", for his apparent love of "inhaling" junk food in the bullpen.&lt;ref name=ALPM&gt;Michael Urban, [http://mlb.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/oak/news/oak_gameday_recap.jsp?ymd=20020831&amp;content_id=118385&amp;vkey=recap&amp;fext=.jsp "Chavez clutch in A's 17th straight"] from ''MLB.com,'' August 31, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2006/10/12/MNGC2LNQQR1.DTL|title=The A's remember the man they fondly called 'Snacks' |last=Slusser|first=Susan|authorlink=Susan Slusser|date=October 12, 2006|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle|pages=A-14|accessdate=April 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Lidle was posthumously inducted into the Binghamton Baseball Shrine since he had played for the Double-A [[Binghamton Mets]] (New York Mets).

===As a Yankee: 2006===
On July 30, 2006, Lidle was traded along with [[outfielder]] [[Bobby Abreu]] from the Philadelphia Phillies to the New York Yankees for minor league [[shortstop]] [[C. J. Henry]], the Yankees' first round pick in the 2005 draft, along with [[left-handed]] reliever [[Matt Smith (baseball)|Matt Smith]], minor league [[catcher]] Jesús Sánchez, and minor league [[right-hander]] [[Carlos Monasterios]]. After being traded, he criticized his former team: "On the days I'm pitching, it's almost a coin flip as to know if the guys behind me are going to be there to play 100 percent." He noted he was joining a Yankee team that expects to win all the time: "That's why I'm most excited about it. Sometimes I felt I got caught up kind of going into the clubhouse nonchalantly sometimes, because all the other guys in the clubhouse didn't go there with one goal in mind."&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, [http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2536712 "Lidle backs off criticism, but Rhodes keeps firing"] from ''ESPN.com,'' August 2, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his first start for the Yankees, he went six innings, giving up one run on four [[hit (baseball)|hits]], [[wikt:en route|en route]] to an 8-1 Yankee victory as part of a sweep against the Toronto Blue Jays.&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, [http://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/articles/2006/08/04/lidle_pitches_in_yankees_sweep/ "Lidle pitches in Yankees sweep] from ''Boston.com,'' August 4, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; On August 21, 2006, he went six three-hit shutout innings, completing an improbable five-game sweep (in four days) over the then second place [[Boston Red Sox]] (who went from {{frac|1|1|2}} games behind to {{frac|6|1|2}}  games behind).&lt;ref&gt;ESPN Wire Services, [http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=260821102 "Yanks finish Boston beatdown, sweep five-game series"] from ''ESPN.com,'' August 21, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 7, in his final game (Game 4 of the [[2006 American League Division Series|2006 ALDS]]), he lasted only an inning and a third, allowing three [[earned run]]s on four hits as the Yankees lost to the [[Detroit Tigers]], 8-3. He was criticized for telling a reporter, "We got matched up with a team that, I think, was a little more ready to play than we were," which was taken by some as a jab at manager [[Joe Torre]]. For damage control, he called the radio talk show ''[[Mike and the Mad Dog]]'' and gave an extended defense of himself and the Yankees.&lt;ref name="kepner" /&gt; The snippy exchange was punctuated by co-host [[Chris Russo]]'s implication that Lidle was not entitled to "enjoy a day in New York" and co-host [[Mike Francesa]] commenting, "I haven't thought much about you at all, to be honest with you." Following reports of his death, both hosts of the popular New York radio show expressed remorse for their hostility to him.&lt;ref&gt;Neil Best, "Francesa feels haunted by Lidle interview" from ''Newsday,'' October 12, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Marchand, "Interview got ugly" from the ''New York Post,'' October 12, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scouting report==
Lidle threw an 88–90&amp;nbsp;mph [[fastball]] with cut and sink. He threw a low-70s [[curveball]] to keep hitters off balance, and a low-80s [[slider]].  He was a finesse pitcher who had to rely on changing speeds and pinpoint location.

==Death==
{{main|2006 New York City plane crash}}
On October 11, 2006, Lidle and co-pilot/flight instructor Tyler Stanger were flying a [[Cirrus SR20]] airplane when it crashed into the [[Belaire Apartments]] complex at 527 East 72nd Street on New York City's [[Upper East Side]], killing them both.&lt;ref name="CNNFlames"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/10/11/plane.crash/index.html|title= Yankees pitcher killed in crash of small plane in Manhattan|date=October 12, 2006|publisher=CNN|accessdate=May 8, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090415025229/http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/10/11/plane.crash/index.html| archivedate=April 15, 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plane was flying above the East River past the [[Queensboro Bridge]] toward restricted airspace. A strong wind from the east due to an incoming front caused the plane to be blown into the building as it was making a 180-degree turn. In addition to the deaths of Lidle and Stanger, 26 were injured in the accident, about half of them [[New York City Fire Department|New York City firefighters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ntsb.gov/Pressrel/2006/061103.htm |title=Update on Cirrus Plane Crash in Manhattan, New York|publisher=NTSB |date=November 3, 2006|accessdate=May 8, 2009|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090514235615/http://ntsb.gov/Pressrel/2006/061103.htm |archivedate = May 14, 2009|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Woman Burned in NYC Plane Crash Released |agency=Associated Press |publisher=[[Fox News Channel|Fox News]] |date=November 10, 2006 |url=http://origin.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,228732,00.html |accessdate=May 8, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711022239/http://origin.foxnews.com/story/0%2C2933%2C228732%2C00.html |archivedate=July 11, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lidle was the third Yankee to die in a plane crash. The prior two were catcher [[Thurman Munson]] (on August 2, 1979) and pitcher [[Jim Hardin]] (on March 9, 1991). Yankees owner [[George Steinbrenner]] described Lidle's death as a "terrible and shocking tragedy that has stunned the entire Yankees organization" and offered his condolences to Lidle's wife and six-year-old son.&lt;ref&gt;"Investigators go over Lidle crash scene", Hajela, Deepti, Associated Press. October 12, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; On October 12, 2006, before the [[2006 National League Championship Series|2006 NLCS]] game in New York City between the New York Mets and the [[St. Louis Cardinals]], both teams and all spectators observed a [[moment of silence]] in Lidle's memory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/wire?section=mlb&amp;id=2622813 ALCS Game 3 on Friday afternoon; NLCS Game 2 at night], Associated Press. October 12, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Yankees wore black armbands during the entire 2007 season in memory of Lidle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sportsnetwork.com/default.asp?c=sportsnetwork&amp;page=/mlb/news/AAN4063367.htm|title=Yankees to honor Lidle with armband|date=February 15, 2007|publisher=[[The Sports Network]]}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 2, 2007, Cory's widow Melanie and his son Christopher both threw the [[ceremonial first pitch]] on [[Opening Day]] at [[Yankee Stadium]]. Melanie Lidle attended the 2007 graduation ceremony at [[Mt. San Antonio College]] in [[Walnut, California]]. The community college's aviation team flew across the graduation field during the ceremony to pay respect to both Lidle and Stanger.

Lidle is buried in Forest Lawn Memorial Park - Covina Hills, in [[Covina, California]]. One of the baseball fields at West Covina's Cortez Park is named "Cory Lidle Field" in his memory.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

==Personal life==
Lidle was a descendant of [[Robert Fulton]], the inventor of the steamboat, as reflected in his middle name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/mlb/news/story?id=2621860|title=Lidle dies after plane crashes into Manhattan high-rise|date=October 11, 2006|website=ESPN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lidle's twin brother, Kevin, also played baseball, as a catcher and pitcher for various [[Minor League Baseball|minor league]] teams between 1992 and 2002, and for an [[Independent baseball league|independent]] team in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.fcgi?id=lidle-001kev |title=Kevin Lidle Minor &amp; Independent Leagues Statistics &amp; History |website=[[Baseball-Reference.com]] |date=January 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
