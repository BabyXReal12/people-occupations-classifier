'''Malcolm Stevenson Forbes''' (19 August 1919&amp;nbsp;– 24 February 1990) was an American entrepreneur most prominently known as the publisher of ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine, founded by his father [[B. C. Forbes]]. He was known as an avid promoter of capitalism and free market trade, and for an extravagant lifestyle, spending on parties, travel, and his collection of homes, yachts, aircraft, art, motorcycles, and [[Fabergé egg]]s.

==Life and career==
Forbes was born on 19 August 1919 in [[Englewood, New Jersey]], the son of Adelaide Mary (Stevenson) and Scottish-born financial journalist and author [[B. C. Forbes]].&lt;ref&gt;James, George. [https://www.nytimes.com/1990/02/25/obituaries/malcolm-forbes-publisher-dies-at-70.html "Malcolm Forbes, Publisher, Dies at 70"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', February 25, 1990. Accessed November 25, 2017. "Born in Englewood, N.J., on August 19, 1919, Mr. Forbes was the third son of Bertie Charles Forbes, a Scottish emigrant who founded Forbes magazine in 1917. Young Forbes attended the Lawrenceville School and Princeton University, where he majored in politics and economics."&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from the [[Lawrenceville School]] in 1937&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawrenceville.org/about/history/notable-alumni/index.aspx |title=NOTABLE ALUMNI |publisher=The Lawrenceville School |accessdate=16 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Princeton University]].&lt;ref name=NYTObit&gt;{{cite news |author= |author2= |title=Malcolm Forbes, publisher, Dies at 70 |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CEFDC1438F935A15751C0A966958260 |quote=Malcolm Forbes, chairman and editor in chief of Forbes Magazine and a flamboyant multimillionaire whose enthusiastic pursuits included yachting, motorcycling and ballooning, died Saturday of a heart attack in his sleep at his home in Far Hills, N.J. ... Young Forbes attended the Lawrenceville School and Princeton University, where he majored in politics and economics.... Entering politics in 1949, he was elected to the Borough Council in Bernardsville, N.J., and from 1951 to 1957 served in the New Jersey Senate and then ran for governor on the Republican ticket with a pledge of 'No State Income Tax.' |work=[[New York Times]] |date=26 February 1990 |accessdate=3 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Forbes enlisted in the Army in 1942 and served as a machine gunner in the [[84th Infantry Division (United States)|84th Infantry Division]] in [[European theatre of World War II|Europe]], rising to the rank of [[staff sergeant]].  Forbes received a thigh wound in combat, and received a [[Bronze Star]] and a [[Purple Heart]].&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;

After dabbling in politics, including service in the [[New Jersey Senate]] from 1951 to 1957 and an unsuccessful candidacy for [[Governor of New Jersey]],&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt; he committed to the magazine full-time by 1957, three years after his father's death.  After the death of his brother Bruce Charles Forbes in 1964, he acquired sole control of the company.

The magazine grew steadily under his leadership, and he diversified into real estate sales and other ventures. One of his last projects was the magazine ''Egg'', which chronicled New York's nightlife. (The title had nothing to do with Forbes's famous [[Fabergé egg]] collection.) To honor his contribution to the magazine, Forbes won the [[Walter Cronkite Award for Excellence in Journalism]] in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Arizona State University|title=Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication|url=https://cronkite.asu.edu/about/walter-cronkite-and-asu/walter-cronkite-award|accessdate=November 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malcolm Forbes had a lavish lifestyle, exemplified by his private ''Capitalist Tool'' [[Boeing 727]] [[trijet]], ever larger ''Highlander'' yachts, huge art collection, substantial collection of [[Harley-Davidson]] motorbikes, his French Chateau ([[Château de Balleroy]] in Normandy), his collections of special shape [[hot air balloon]]s and historical documents, as well as his opulent birthday parties. Additionally in the mid-1960s he was a fixture at NYC's famous Cat Club on Wednesday nights, supporting local musical talents.
[[File:Chateau de Balleroy.JPG|thumb|Forbes' [[Château de Balleroy]]]]
He chose the Palais Mendoub (which he had acquired from the Moroccan government in 1970) in the northwestern city of [[Tangier]], Morocco, to host his 70th birthday party. Spending an estimated $2.5&amp;nbsp;million, he chartered a [[Boeing 747]], a DC-8 and a [[Concorde]] to fly in eight hundred of the world's rich and famous from New York and London. The guests included his friend [[Elizabeth Taylor]] (who acted as a co-host), [[Gianni Agnelli]], [[Robert Maxwell]], [[Barbara Walters]], [[Henry Kissinger]], half a dozen US state governors, and the CEOs of scores of multinational corporations likely to advertise in his magazine. The party entertainment was on a grand scale, including 600 drummers, acrobats and dancers and a fantasia&amp;nbsp;– a cavalry charge which ends with the firing of muskets into the air&amp;nbsp;– by 300 [[Berber people|Berber]] horsemen.

Forbes became a motorcyclist late in life. He founded and rode with a motorcycle club called the Capitalist Tools. His estate in New Jersey was a regular meeting place for tours that he organised for fellow New Jersey and New York motorcyclists. He had a stable of motorcycles but was partial to [[Harley-Davidson]] machines. He was known for his gift of Purple Passion, a Harley-Davidson, to actress [[Elizabeth Taylor]]. He was also instrumental in getting legislation passed to allow motorcycles on the cars-only Garden State Parkway in New Jersey. He was inducted to the [[Motorcycle Hall of Fame]] in 1999.&lt;ref name=AMA/&gt; In 2008, he was inducted into the [[New Jersey Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bruce leads first group of inductees into New Jersey Hall of Fame |last=Rothman |first=Carly |date=5 May 2008 |url=http://www.nj.com/news/ledger/topstories/index.ssf/2008/05/bruce_leads_inductees_into_nj.html | newspaper=[[The Newark Star Ledger]] |access-date=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Forbes was married for thirty-nine years to Roberta Remsen Laidlaw before their divorce in 1985. The couple had five children: Malcolm S. Jr., Robert Laidlaw, Christopher Charles, Timothy Carter, and Moira Hamilton. Malcolm S. Forbes Jr., known as Steve, ran for president in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/literature-and-arts/journalism-and-publishing-biographies/malcolm-forbes&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Forbes died in 1990 of a heart attack at age 70, at his home, Timberfield, in [[Far Hills, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt; He was pronounced dead by his friend and physician, Dr. Oscar Kruesi, said Don Garson, director of corporate communications for Forbes Inc.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1990/02/26/obituaries/malcolm-forbes-publisher-dies-at-70.html?pagewanted=all&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1990, soon after his death, ''[[OutWeek]]'' magazine published a story with the cover headline "The Secret Gay Life of Malcolm Forbes," by [[Michelangelo Signorile]], which [[outed]] Forbes as a gay man.&lt;ref name="teoo"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=FineLine: the Newsletter on Journalism Ethics|volume=2|issue=2|date=May 1990|pages=6|url=http://journalism.indiana.edu/resources/ethics/invading-privacy/the-ethics-of-outing/|title=The ethics of "outing": Breaking the silence code on homosexuality|publisher=Archived at Indiana University School of Journalism ethics cases online|author=Gabriel Rotello|accessdate=3 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Signorile was critical of the media for helping Forbes publicise many aspects of his life while keeping his homosexuality a secret. The writer asked, "Is our society so overwhelmingly repressive that even individuals as all-powerful as the late Malcolm Forbes feel they absolutely cannot come out of the
closet?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Even in death, the media was reluctant to disclose his sexuality; the ''[[New York Times]]'' would refer only to him as a "famous, deceased millionaire"&lt;ref name="teoo"/&gt; while reporting on the controversy. Since Malcolm Forbes' death, his son [[Steve Forbes]] has been editor-in-chief but the business is no longer family-controlled.

[[Donald Trump]], in his 1990 memoir ''Trump: Surviving at the Top'', alleged that his temporary removal from the [[Forbes 400]] in the year Forbes died was due to a feud that had arisen after Trump had not allowed Forbes to bring "two young men who appeared to be well under the legal drinking age" into the bar at the [[Plaza Hotel]]. Trump stated that Forbes "lived openly as a homosexual... but expected the media and his famous friends to cover for him."&lt;ref name="TrumpLeerhsen1990"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Donald Trump|author2=Charles Leerhsen|title=Trump: surviving at the top|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jnSfMHluCxEC|date=14 August 1990|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-0-394-57597-1|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HaddenLuce1990"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Briton Hadden|author2=Henry Robinson Luce|title=Time|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EhYnAQAAIAAJ|date=July 1990|publisher=Time Incorporated|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
