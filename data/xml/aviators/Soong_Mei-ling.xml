'''Soong Mei-ling''' or '''Soong May-ling''' ({{zh|t=宋美齡|p=Sòng Měilíng}}; March 5, 1898&lt;ref name="birth"/&gt; – October 23, 2003), also known as '''Madame Chiang Kai-shek''' or '''Madame Chiang''', was a Chinese political figure who was [[First Lady]] of the Republic of China, the wife of [[Generalissimo]] and [[President of the Republic of China|President]] [[Chiang Kai-shek]]. Soong played a prominent role in the politics of the Republic of China and was the sister-in-law of [[Sun Yat-sen]], the founder and the leader of the Republic of China. She was active in the civic life of her country and held many honorary and active positions, including chairman of [[Fu Jen Catholic University]]. During the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] she rallied her people against the Japanese invasion and in 1943 conducted an eight month speaking tour of the [[United States|United States of America]] to gain support. She was also the youngest and the last surviving of the three [[Soong sisters]], and one of only two [[first lady|first ladies]] during World War II (along with [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]], 1900-2002) who lived into the 21st century.  Her life traversed three centuries.&lt;ref name=nytobit/&gt;

==Early life==
She was born in [[Hongkou District]], [[Shanghai]], [[China]], on March 5, 1898,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Karon|first1=Tony|title=Madame Chiang Kai-Shek, 1898-2003|url=http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,526008,00.html|accessdate=12 August 2017|work=Time|date=24 October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; though some biographies give the year as 1897, since [[East Asian age reckoning|Chinese tradition considers one to be a year old at birth]].&lt;ref name="birth"&gt;While records at [[Wellesley College]] and the Encyclopædia Britannica indicate she was born in 1897, the Republic of China government as well as the BBC and the New York Times cite her year of birth as 1897.{{clarify |reason=Which sources claim "1898" and which claim "1897"? Right now, this note says that Wellesley, Britannica, ROC, BBC &amp; NYT all claim 1897.|date=May 2016}} The ''New York Times'' obituary includes the following explanation: "some references give 1897 as the year because the Chinese usually consider everyone to be one year old at birth." cf: [[East Asian age reckoning]]. However, early sources such as the Columbia Encyclopedia, 1960, give her date of birth as 1896, making it possible that "one year" was subtracted twice.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nytobit/&gt;

She was the fourth of six children of [[Charlie Soong]], a wealthy businessman and former [[Methodist]] missionary from [[Hainan]], and his wife Ni Kwei-tseng (倪桂珍 ''Ní Guìzhēn''). Mei-ling's siblings were sister [[Soong Ai-ling|Ai-ling]], sister [[Soong Ching-ling|Ching-ling, who later became Madame Sun Yat-sen]], older brother [[T. V. Soong|Tse-ven]] and younger brothers Tse-liang (T.L.) and Tse-an (T.A.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tyson Li |first=Laura |title=[[Madame Chiang Kai-shek: China's Eternal First Lady]] |year=2006 |publisher=Grove Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-8021-4322-8 |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
[[File:Soong May ling Wesleyan student photo.jpg|thumb|upright|left|May-ling as a student at [[Wesleyan College]] c. 1910]]
In Shanghai, May-ling attended the [[McTyeire School]] for Girls with her sister, Ching-ling. Their father, who had studied in the United States, arranged to have them continue their education in the US in 1907. May-ling and Ching-ling attended a private school in [[Summit, New Jersey]]. In 1908, Ching-ling was accepted by her sister Ai-ling's alma mater, [[Wesleyan College]], at age 15 and both sisters moved to [[Macon, Georgia]], to join Ai-ling. However, she could not get permission to stay on campus as a family member nor could she be a student because she was too young.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}
May-ling spent the year in [[Demorest, Georgia]], with Ai-ling's Wesleyan friend, Blanche Moss, who enrolled May-ling as an 8th grader at  [[Piedmont College]]. In 1909, Wesleyan's newly appointed president, William Newman Ainsworth, gave her permission to stay at Wesleyan and assigned her tutors. She briefly attended [[DuBose Conference Center|Fairmount College]] in [[Monteagle, Tennessee]] in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Southeast Tennessee Tourist Association|url=http://www.southeasttennessee.com/www/docs/665.2722/church-training-school-in-monteagle-tennessee.htm|publisher=Southeast Tourist Tourist Association|accessdate=9 July 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003123646/http://www.southeasttennessee.com/www/docs/665.2722/church-training-school-in-monteagle-tennessee.htm|archivedate=3 October 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chitty, Arther and Elizabeth, ''Sewanee Sampler'', 1978, p. 106; {{ISBN|0-9627687-7-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

May-ling was officially registered as a freshman at Wesleyan in 1912 at the age of 15. She then transferred to [[Wellesley College]] two years later to be closer to her older brother, T. V., who, at the time, was studying at [[Harvard]]. By then, both her sisters had graduated and returned to Shanghai. She graduated from Wellesley as one of the 33 "Durant Scholars" on June 19, 1917, with a major in [[English literature]] and minor in [[philosophy]]. She was also a member of Tau Zeta Epsilon, Wellesley's Arts and Music Society. As a result of being educated in English all her life, she spoke excellent English, with a pronounced [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] accent which helped her connect with American audiences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wellesley.edu/Anniversary/chiang.html Profile], wellesley.edu; accessed July 28, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Madame Chiang==
[[File:1927 Chiang Soong wedding photo1.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Chiang-Soong wedding photo]]
Soong Mei-ling met [[Chiang Kai-shek]] in 1920. Since he was eleven years her elder, already married, and a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]], Mei-ling's mother vehemently opposed the marriage between the two, but finally agreed after Chiang showed proof of his divorce and promised to convert to [[Christianity]]. Chiang told his future mother-in-law that he could not convert immediately, because religion needed to be gradually absorbed, not swallowed like a pill. They married in Shanghai on December 1, 1927.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=CHINA: Soong Sisters|author= |newspaper=TIME|date=December 12, 1927|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,737073,00.html|accessdate=May 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; While biographers regard the marriage with varying appraisals of partnership, love, politics and competition, it lasted 48 years. The couple had no children. In 1928, she was made a member of the [[Committee of Yuans]] by Chiang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=CHINA: Potent Mrs. Chiang|author= |newspaper=TIME|date=November 26, 1928|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,732100,00.html|accessdate=May 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
They renewed their wedding vows on May 24, 1944 at St. Bartholomew's Church in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;St. Bartholomew's Church Marriage Registration 1944.&lt;/ref&gt; Polly Smith sang the Lord's Prayer at the ceremony.

Madame Chiang initiated the [[New Life Movement]] and became actively engaged in Chinese politics. She was a member of the [[Legislative Yuan]] from 1930 to 1932 and Secretary-General of the Chinese Aeronautical Affairs Commission from 1936 to 1938. In 1945 she became a member of the [[Kuomintang#Organization|Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang]]. As her husband rose to become Generalissimo and leader of the [[Kuomintang]], Madame Chiang acted as his English translator, secretary and advisor. She was his muse, his eyes, his ears, and his most loyal champion. During [[World War II]], Madame Chiang tried to promote the Chinese cause and build a legacy for her husband on a par with [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]], [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] and [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]. Well-versed in both Chinese and Western culture, she became popular both in China and abroad. Her prominence led [[Joseph Stilwell]] to quip that she ought to be appointed minister of defense.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

In 1931, Soong Mei-ling had a villa built for her on the east side of [[Nanjing]]. Located a few hundred meters east of the Sifangcheng Pavilion of the [[Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum]], the villa still exists, and is commonly known as Meilinggong (美龄宫), "Mei-ling Palace".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.synotrip.com/nanjing/tourist-attractions/meiling-villa-1444.shtml Meiling Villa], synotrip.com; accessed July 28, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Warphans"==
[[File:Liangyou 136 cover - Soong May-ling.jpg|thumb|upright|Soong Mei-ling on the cover of ''[[The Young Companion]]'', April 1938, as Deputy Commander of the [[Republic of China Air Force]]]]
Although Soong Mei-ling initially avoided the public eye after marrying Chiang, she soon began an ambitious social welfare project to establish schools for the orphans of Chinese soldiers. The orphanages were well-appointed: with playgrounds, hotels, swimming pools, a gymnasium, model classrooms, and dormitories. Soong Mei-ling was deeply involved in the project and even picked all of the teachers herself. There were two schools - one for boys and one for girls—built on a thousand-acre site at the foot of [[Purple Mountain]], in Nanjing. She referred to these children as her "warphans" and made them a personal cause.&lt;ref&gt;Tyson Li 2006, pp. 87–88&lt;/ref&gt; The fate of the children of fallen soldiers became a much more important issue in China after the beginning of the war with Japan in 1937. In order to better provide for these children she established the Chinese Women's National War Relief Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scott Wong|first=Kevin|title=Americans first: Chinese Americans and the Second World War |year=2005 |publisher=Harvard University Press |page=93 |isbn=9780674016712 |url=http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674016712}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visits to the U.S.==
[[File:Madamn Chiang Kaishek US Congress speech(1).ogg|thumb|left|On February 18, 1943, she addressed both houses of the US Congress.]]
Soong Mei-ling made several tours to the [[United States]] to lobby support for the Nationalists' war effort. She drew crowds as large as 30,000 people and in 1943 made the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'' magazine for a third time. She had earlier appeared on the October 26, 1931 cover alongside her husband and on the January 3, 1937 cover with her husband as "[[Time Person of the Year|Man and Wife of the Year]]"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19380103,00.html TIME Magazine cover]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Karon|first=Tony|title=Madame Chiang Kai-shek, 1898-2003|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,526008,00.html|publisher=Time.com|accessdate=27 July 2011|date=October 24, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both husband and wife were on good terms with ''Time'' magazine senior editor and co-founder [[Henry Luce]], who frequently tried to rally money and support from the American public for the [[Republic of China]]. On February 18, 1943, she became the first Chinese national and the second woman to address both houses of the [[Congress of the United States|US Congress]]. After the defeat of her husband's government in the [[Chinese Civil War]] in 1949, Madame Chiang followed her husband to [[Taiwan]], while her sister [[Soong Ching-ling]] stayed in [[mainland China]], siding with the [[Communist Party of China|communists]]. Madame Chiang continued to play a prominent international role. She was a Patron of the [[International Red Cross Committee]], honorary chair of the British United Aid to China Fund, and First Honorary Member of the Bill of Rights Commemorative Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=|url=http://academics.wellesley.edu/Polisci/wj/208/Madame%20Chiang%20Kai-Shek.html|title=Madame Chiang Kai-Shek|publisher=Wellesley College|accessdate=1 August 2017|date=14 August 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
[[File:Chiang Kai-shek and Soong May-ling in 1955.jpg|thumb|right|Soong Mei-ling and [[Chiang Kai-shek]] in [[Taipei]], [[Taiwan]]]]
After the death of her husband in 1975, Madame Chiang assumed a low profile. She was first diagnosed with [[breast cancer]] in 1975 and would undergo two mastectomies in [[Taiwan]]. She also had an ovarian tumor removed in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Pakula 2009, p. 659&lt;/ref&gt;

Chiang Kai-shek was succeeded to power by his eldest son [[Chiang Ching-kuo]], from a previous marriage, with whom Madame Chiang had rocky relations. In 1975, she emigrated from [[Taiwan]] to her family's 36 acre (14.6 hectare) estate in [[Lattingtown, New York]], where she kept a portrait of her late husband in full military regalia in her living room. She kept a residence in [[Wolfeboro, New Hampshire]], where she vacationed in the summer. Madame Chiang returned to Taiwan upon Chiang Ching-kuo's death in 1988, to shore up support among her old allies. However, Chiang Ching-kuo's successor, [[Lee Teng-hui]], proved more adept at politics than she was, and consolidated his position. She again returned to the U.S. and made a rare public appearance in 1995 when she attended a reception held on [[United States Capitol|Capitol Hill]] in her honor in connection with celebrations of the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II. Madame Chiang made her last visit to Taiwan in 1995. In the [[ROC presidential election, 2000|2000 Presidential Election on Taiwan]], the [[Kuomintang]] produced a letter from her in which she purportedly supported the KMT candidate [[Lien Chan]] over independent candidate [[James Soong]] (no relation). James Soong had never disputed the authenticity of the letter. Soong sold her [[Long Island]] estate in 2000 and spent the rest of her life in a Gracie Square apartment on the [[Upper East Side]] of [[Manhattan]] owned by her niece. An open house viewing of the estate drew many Taiwanese expatriates. When Madame Chiang was 103 years old, she had an exhibition of her Chinese paintings in New York.&lt;ref&gt;Pakula 2009, p. 670&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Madame Chiang died in her sleep in [[New York City]], in her [[Manhattan]] apartment on October 23, 2003, at the age of 105.&lt;ref name=nytobit&gt;{{cite news |first=Seth |last=Faison |title=Madame Chiang Kai-shek, a Power in Husband's China and Abroad, Dies at 106 |quote=Madame Chiang Kai-shek, a pivotal figure in one of the 20th century's great epics — the struggle for control of post-imperial China waged between the Nationalists and the Communists during the Japanese invasion and the violent aftermath of World War II — died on Thursday in Manhattan, the Foreign Ministry of Taiwan reported yesterday.

Upon her death, The White House released a statement:

===Appraisals by international press===
[[File:Chiang Kai-shek &amp; Mme. Chiang Time Cover.jpg|thumb|upright|Soong and Chiang on the cover of ''TIME'' magazine, Oct 26, 1931]]
The New York Times obituary wrote:
{{quote|As a fluent English speaker, as a Christian, as a model of what many Americans hoped China to become, Madame Chiang struck a chord with American audiences as she traveled across the country, starting in the 1930s, raising money and lobbying for support of her husband's government. She seemed to many Americans to be the very symbol of the modern, educated, pro-American China they yearned to see emerge—even as many Chinese dismissed her as a corrupt, power-hungry symbol of the past they wanted to escape.&lt;ref name=nytobit/&gt;}}
