'''Dennis Alan "Denny" Smith''' (born  January 19, 1938) is a businessman and former United States congressman from the state of [[Oregon]]. A native of the state, he served in the Air Force before working in the airline industry and taking over the family's newspaper business. A Republican, he served ten years in Congress from 1981 until 1991. His father was former Oregon Governor [[Elmo Smith]].

==Early life==
Dennis Smith was born in the [[Eastern Oregon]] city of [[Ontario, Oregon]], on January 19, 1938.&lt;ref name="congbio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=S000527|title=Dennis Alan Smith|work=Biographical Directory of the United States Congress|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=2009-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1956, he graduated from [[Grant Union High School (John Day, Oregon)|Grant Union High School]] in [[John Day, Oregon|John Day]] and enrolled at [[Willamette University]] in [[Salem, Oregon|Salem]].&lt;ref name="congbio"/&gt;

He joined the [[United States Air Force]] in 1958, and served until 1960, when he joined the [[Oregon Air National Guard]].&lt;ref name="congbio"/&gt; Smith then earned a bachelor of arts degree from Willamette in 1961.&lt;ref name="congbio"/&gt; He returned to the Air Force in 1962 and remained there until 1967,&lt;ref name="congbio"/&gt; serving as a fighter pilot in the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name="rg"/&gt; In the war, he flew the [[F-4C Phantom]] and completed about 180 missions.&lt;ref name="rg"/&gt; Smith remained in the aviation field as a flight engineer and co-pilot for a commercial airline, flying from 1967 until 1976.&lt;ref name="congbio"/&gt;

In 1968, he also took over the family's newspaper business when his father died.&lt;ref name="rg"/&gt; He worked for [[Pan American Airlines]], and in 1974 was chosen by fellow employees to serve as the union's lobbyist in [[Washington, DC]].&lt;ref name="rg"/&gt; He was inducted into the [[Oregon Aviation Hall of Honor]] in 2009.

==Political career==
Smith was first elected to the [[United States House of Representatives]] in [[United States House elections, 1980|1980]] to represent [[Oregon's 2nd congressional district]] as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]].&lt;ref name="congbio"/&gt; He defeated 12-term [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Al Ullman]] by only 3,700 votes.&lt;ref name="rg"/&gt;  Smith was undoubtedly helped by [[Ronald Reagan]] winning every county in the sprawling district.  When the [[United States Census, 1980|1980 census]] gave Oregon another [[congressional district]], Smith's home in [[Salem, Oregon|Salem]] was placed in the newly created [[Oregon's 5th congressional district|5th district]].  He was elected from this district in [[United States House elections, 1982|1982]] and was reelected three more times.  While in the House, Smith served on the [[United States House Committee on the Budget|Budget]], the [[United States House Committee on Resources|Interior and Insular Affairs]], and [[United States House Committee on Veterans' Affairs|Veterans' Affairs]] committees.

Smith was comfortably reelected in 1984 and 1986.  In 1988, however, he was nearly defeated by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Michael J. Kopetski|Mike Kopetski]], winning by only 707 votes.  Kopetski sought a rematch in 1990 and won by attacking Smith for his ties to several collapsed [[savings and loan crisis|savings and loans]].&lt;ref name="Rasky"&gt;{{cite news|last = Rasky| first = Susan F|title = Four Issues and How They Played at the Polls Before Uncertain Voters|work = New York Times | pages = B10|date = 1990-11-08| url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE4DE123DF93BA35752C1A966958260|accessdate = 2008-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; While still serving in Congress, Smith established and headed Oregonians Against Crime, which placed Oregon's 1988 Anti-crime Bill on the ballot by [[initiative|initiative petition]] and successfully campaigned for its passage. In [[Oregon gubernatorial election, 1994|1994]], Smith was the Republican nominee for Oregon governor, losing to Democrat [[John Kitzhaber]].

==Later years==
Smith is now the chairman of [[Eagle Newspapers (Oregon)|Eagle Newspapers]], a printing and publishing company in the [[Pacific Northwest]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eaglenewspapers.com/About.aspx Eagle Newspapers: About Us]&lt;/ref&gt;
