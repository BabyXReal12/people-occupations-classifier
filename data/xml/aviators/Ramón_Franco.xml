[[File:RAMON FRANCO AÑO 1926.JPG|thumb|150px|right]]
'''Ramón Franco Bahamonde''' (born 2 February 1896 in the naval station of [[Ferrol, Spain|Ferrol]] in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], [[Spain]] &amp;ndash;28 October 1938),  was a Spanish [[aviator|pioneer of aviation]], a political figure and brother of later [[caudillo]] [[Francisco Franco]]. Well before the [[Spanish Civil War]], during the reign of [[Alfonso XIII of Spain|Alfonso XIII]], both brothers were acclaimed as national heroes in Spain; however, the two had strongly differing political views.  They had a less-known brother, [[Nicolás Franco (politician)|Nicolás]].

==The Aviator==

Ramón started his career as an ordinary successful military officer in the infantry, assigned to [[Morocco]] in 1914. In 1920 he joined the [[Spanish Air Force]], participating in activities that earned him international attention. In [[1926 in aviation|1926]] he became a national hero when he piloted the [[Plus Ultra (hydroplane)|''Plus Ultra'']] flying boat on a [[transatlantic flight]]. His co-pilot was [[Julio Ruiz de Alda Miqueleiz]]; the other crew members were Teniente de Navio (Navy Lieutenant) Juan Manuel Duran and the mechanic Pablo Rada. The ''Plus Ultra'' departed from [[Palos de la Frontera]], in [[Huelva (province)|Huelva]], Spain on January 22 and arrived in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]] on January 26. It stopped over at [[Gran Canaria]], [[Cape Verde]], [[Pernambuco]], [[Rio de Janeiro]] and [[Montevideo]]. The 10,270&amp;nbsp;km journey was completed in 59 hours and 39 minutes.

The event appeared in most of the major newspapers worldwide. Throughout the Spanish-speaking world the Spanish aviators were glamorously acclaimed, particularly in Argentina and Spain where thousands gathered at [[Christopher Columbus]] square in [[Madrid]]. 

In 1929 he attempted another trans-[[Atlantic]] flight, this time crashing the airplane to the sea. The crew was rescued days later by an [[aircraft carrier]] of the British [[Royal Navy]].

==Political activism==
During the reign of [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]] he declared himself on several occasions against the regime. He conspired against the Monarchy, inflicted losses on the army and was sent to prison, from which he was able to escape.  In December 1930, along with other [[Second Spanish Republic|Republican]] aviators, he seized some aircraft at the aerodrome of [[Spanish Air Force|Cuatro Vientos]] and flew over Madrid dropping leaflets which falsely stated a republican revolution had broken out all over Spain, calling on citizens and soldiers to aid the movement and stating that troops' quarters would be bombed shortly if they did not help in the revolution. He fled to [[Portugal]] and returned to Spain when the [[Second Spanish Republic]] was proclaimed.

Reentering the Army, he was named chief of a main directorate of Aeronautics, a position from which he was dismissed shortly afterwards for his participation in an [[anarchist]] revolt in [[Andalusia]]. He was elected as a deputy in the [[Cortes Generales|Cortes]] for [[Republican Left of Catalonia]] in [[Barcelona]], retiring from the army and focused on politics.

==Civil War==
When the [[Spanish Civil War]] exploded in July 1936, he was in the [[United States]] as an [[air attaché]] of the Spanish Embassy.

Upon his return to Spain, in spite of his [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] political past, he joined the [[Francoist Spain|Nationalist]] side, of which his brother Francisco was a main leader. He was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel and was named head of the airbase at [[Majorca]].  His receipt of the command in Majorca was "received very badly" by his fellow aviators,&lt;ref&gt;Payne, S.G. ''The Franco Regime, 1936-1975''. Madison: University of Wisconsin, 1987. p 195 note 91.&lt;/ref&gt; who resented that Ramón, a [[Freemason]] who had been dismissed, had been promoted over officers with war merits.

==Death==
Ramón Franco was killed in an [[air accident]] on October 28, 1938 when his [[seaplane|hydroplane]] crashed off [[Pollença]], near the coast of Majorca, while attempting to bomb Republican-controlled [[Valencia (city in Spain)|Valencia]].  His body was found floating in the water and his death lead to rumors of conspiracies and sabotage.&lt;ref&gt;Payne, S.G. ''The Franco Regime: 1936-1975''. Madison: University of Wisconsin, 1987. p 195 &amp; note 91.&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the crash his brother Francisco, who would rule Spain for the next three decades, severed most relations with his brother's widow and daughter.&lt;ref&gt;Payne, S.G. ''The Franco Regime, 1936-1975''.  Madison: University of Wisconsin, 1987. p 195-96.&lt;/ref&gt;
