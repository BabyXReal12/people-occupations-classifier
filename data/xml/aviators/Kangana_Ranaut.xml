'''Kangana Ranaut''' ({{IPA-hns|kəŋɡənaː raːɳoːʈʰ|pron}}; born 23 March 1987) is an Indian actress who works in [[Bollywood|Hindi films]]. One of the highest-paid actresses in the country, she is the recipient of [[Kangana Ranaut, roles and awards#Awards and nominations|several awards]], including three [[National Film Awards]] and four [[Filmfare Awards]]. Ranaut has featured five times in ''[[Forbes India]]''{{'s}} [[Celebrity 100]] list.

Born in Bhambla, a small town in [[Himachal Pradesh]], Ranaut initially aspired to become a doctor at the insistence of her parents. Determined to build her own career path, she relocated to [[Delhi]] at age sixteen, where she briefly became a model. After training under the theatre director [[Arvind Gaur]], Ranaut made her feature film debut in the 2006 thriller ''[[Gangster (2006 film)|Gangster]]'', for which she was awarded the [[Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut]]. She received praise for portraying emotionally intense characters in the dramas ''[[Woh Lamhe]]'' (2006), ''[[Life in a... Metro]]'' (2007) and ''[[Fashion (2008 film)|Fashion]]'' (2008). For the last of these, she won the [[National Film Award for Best Supporting Actress]].

Ranaut featured in the commercially successful films ''[[Raaz: The Mystery Continues]]'' (2009) and ''[[Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai]]'' (2010), though she was criticised for being [[Typecasting (acting)|typecast]] in [[neurosis|neurotic]] roles. A comic role opposite [[R. Madhavan]] in the 2011 box office hit ''[[Tanu Weds Manu]]'' was well-received, though this was followed by a series of brief, glamorous roles in films that failed to propel her career forward. This changed in 2013 when she played a [[mutant]] opposite [[Hrithik Roshan]] in the science fiction film ''[[Krrish 3]]'' (2013), one of the [[List of highest-grossing Indian films|highest-grossing Indian films]]. Ranaut went on to win two consecutive [[National Film Award for Best Actress|National Film Awards for Best Actress]] for playing a naive woman in the comedy-drama ''[[Queen (2014 film)|Queen]]'' (2014) and a dual role in the comedy sequel ''[[Tanu Weds Manu: Returns]]'' (2015), which ranks as the most successful Hindi film featuring a female protagonist. She followed this by starring in a series of films that did not perform well commercially.

Ranaut is credited in the media as one of the most fashionable celebrities in the country, and she has launched her own clothing lines for the brand [[Bestseller (company)|Vero Moda]]. Her reputation for expressing her honest opinions in public and her troubled relationships have frequently sparked controversy.

==Early life and background==

In Delhi, Ranaut was unsure which career to choose; the [[Elite Model Management|Elite Modelling Agency]] were impressed by her looks and suggested that she model for them.&lt;ref name="biography"/&gt;&lt;ref name="soul"/&gt; She took on a few modelling assignments, but generally disliked the career as she found "no scope for creativity".&lt;ref name="biography"/&gt;&lt;ref name="soul"/&gt; Ranaut decided to shift focus towards acting and joined the Asmita Theatre Group, where she trained under the theatre director [[Arvind Gaur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mahajan |first=Esha |title=Two decades of Asmita theatre |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/Two-decades-of-Asmita-theatre/articleshow/14242879.cms?referral=PM |accessdate=9 March 2014 |newspaper=The Times of India |date=18 June 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161230165629/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/Two-decades-of-Asmita-theatre/articleshow/14242879.cms?referral=PM |archivedate=30 December 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She participated in Gaur's theatre workshop at the [[India Habitat Centre]], acting in several of his plays, including the [[Girish Karnad]]-scripted ''[[Taledanda]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=10 things you didn't know about Kangna Ranaut |url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/report/slide-show-1-10-things-you-didnt-know-about-kangna-ranaut/20140307.htm#1 |publisher=[[Rediff.com]] |accessdate=9 March 2014 |date=7 March 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140309113920/http://www.rediff.com/movies/report/slide-show-1-10-things-you-didnt-know-about-kangna-ranaut/20140307.htm |archivedate= 9 March 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During a performance, when one of the male actors went missing, Ranaut played his part along with her original role of a woman.&lt;ref name="hearts"&gt;{{cite news|last=Uniyal |first=Parmita |title=Kangana Ranaut: from tragedy queen to queen of hearts |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/entertainment/bollywood/kangana-ranaut-from-tragedy-queen-to-queen-of-hearts/article1-1198920.aspx#sthash.Pzc3J6G9.dpuf |accessdate=25 March 2014 |newspaper=Hindustan Times |date=22 March 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140325015859/http://www.hindustantimes.com/entertainment/bollywood/kangana-ranaut-from-tragedy-queen-to-queen-of-hearts/article1-1198920.aspx |archivedate=25 March 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A positive reaction from the audience prompted her to relocate to [[Mumbai]] to pursue a career in film and she enrolled herself for a four-month acting course in Asha Chandra's drama school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sahani |first=Alaka |title=Kangana Ranaut: ‘Queen’ is changing the way my contemporaries perceive me |url=http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/kangana-ranaut-queen-is-changing-the-way-my-contemporaries-perceive-me/99/ |accessdate=26 March 2014 |newspaper=The Indian Express |date=23 March 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140326062902/http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/kangana-ranaut-queen-is-changing-the-way-my-contemporaries-perceive-me/99/ |archivedate=26 March 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ranaut struggled with her meager earnings during this period, eating only "bread and [[Pickles in India and Pakistan|aachar]] (pickle)".

In 2004, the producers Ramesh Sharma and Pahlaj Nilani announced that Ranaut would make her film debut with the Deepak Shivdasani-directed ''I Love You Boss''.&lt;ref name="debut"/&gt;&lt;ref name="catch"&gt;{{cite news|last=Shah |first=Kunal M. |title=Catch 22 |url=http://www.mumbaimirror.com/entertainment/bollywood/Catch-22/articleshow/15913784.cms |accessdate=21 March 2014 |newspaper=[[Mumbai Mirror]] |date=1 April 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030127/http://www.mumbaimirror.com/entertainment/bollywood/Catch-22/articleshow/15913784.cms |archivedate=22 March 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, an agent took her to the office of the producer [[Mahesh Bhatt]], where she interacted with the director [[Anurag Basu]] and auditioned for the lead role in the romantic thriller ''[[Gangster (2006 film)|Gangster]]''.&lt;ref name="soul"/&gt;&lt;ref name="loss"&gt;{{cite news|title=Chitrangada Singh's loss was Kangana Ranaut's gain |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Entertainment/Hindi/TV/News/Chitrangada-Singhs-loss-was-Kangana-Ranauts-gain/articleshow/39037411.cms |accessdate=27 July 2014 |newspaper=The Times of India |date=26 July 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150830170630/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Entertainment/Hindi/TV/News/Chitrangada-Singhs-loss-was-Kangana-Ranauts-gain/articleshow/39037411.cms |archivedate=30 August 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bhatt felt that she was too young for the role and signed [[Chitrangada Singh]] instead.

==Personal life==
[[File:Kangana Ranaut.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=Kangana Ranaut is walking the ramp|Ranaut at the 2011 [[Femina Miss India]] ceremony]]
Ranaut has stated that her initial years in the film industry were marred with difficulties as she was unprepared to be an actress.&lt;ref name="english"/&gt; She was conscious of her poor command of the English language and struggled to "fit in".&lt;ref name="english"/&gt; In a 2013 interview with ''Daily News and Analysis'', Ranaut recollected:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"People in the industry treated me like I didn't deserve to be spoken to and I was some unwanted object. I couldn't speak English fluently and people made fun of me for that. So dealing with rejection became a part of life.&amp;nbsp;... All that has taken a toll, I guess. I find it hard to deal with praise. Today, when people say that I have made it and made it on my own, I feel like locking up myself somewhere&amp;nbsp;... It scares me."&lt;ref name="treat"&gt;{{cite news|last=Naval-Shetye |first=Aakanksha |title=I was treated like a dog: Kangana Ranaut |url=http://www.dnaindia.com/entertainment/report-i-was-treated-like-a-dog-kangana-ranaut-1806754 |accessdate=28 March 2014 |newspaper=Daily News and Analysis |date=3 March 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328055919/http://www.dnaindia.com/entertainment/report-i-was-treated-like-a-dog-kangana-ranaut-1806754 |archivedate=28 March 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
