'''Veronica Lake''' (born '''Constance Frances Marie Ockelman'''; November 14, 1922&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Census, April 1, 1930, [[Washington (state)|State of Washington]], [[King County, Washington|County of Kings]], enumeration district 1657, page 8-B, family 151, Constance Ockelman (''sic''), age 7 years, born in [[Seattle]]. Her father, Harry Ockelman, Jr., is listed as unmarried in the [[1920 United States Census]] of [[Pennsylvania]].&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– July 7, 1973) was an American film, stage, and television actress. Lake won both popular and critical acclaim for her role in ''[[Sullivan's Travels]]'' and for [[femme fatale]] roles in [[film noir]]s with [[Alan Ladd]], during the 1940s. She was also well known for her peek-a-boo hairstyle. Lake's career had begun to decline by the late 1940s, in part due to her [[alcoholism]]. She made only one film in the 1950s but appeared in several [[guest appearance]] roles on television. She returned to the screen in 1966 with a role in the film ''[[Footsteps in the Snow]]'', but the role failed to revitalize her career.

Lake released her memoirs, ''Veronica: The Autobiography of Veronica Lake'', in 1970. She used the money she made from the book to finance a low-budget horror film ''[[Flesh Feast (film)|Flesh Feast]]''. It was her final onscreen role. Lake died in July 1973 from [[hepatitis]] and [[acute kidney injury]] at the age of 50.

==Youth==
Lake was born '''Constance Frances Marie Ockelman''' in the New York City borough of [[Brooklyn]]. Her father, Harry Eugene Ockelman, was of [[German Americans|German]] and [[Irish people|Irish]] descent,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/MG8H-R9J |title= Person Details for Harry E Ockelman in household of Harry Ockelman, "United States Census, 1910"&amp;nbsp;— FamilySearch.org|publisher=ancestry.com|access-date=June 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Parrish|first=Robert James|title=The Paramount Pretties|year=1972|publisher=Arlington House|isbn=0-025-08170-5|page=410}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomas|first=Calvin Beck|title=Scream Queens: Heroines of the Horrors|year=1978|publisher=Macmillian|isbn=0-025-08170-5|page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Burroughs Hannsberry|first=Karen|title=Femme Noir: Bad Girls of Film|year=1998|publisher=McFarland|isbn=0-786-40429-9|page=300}}&lt;/ref&gt; and worked for an oil company aboard a ship. He died in an industrial explosion in [[Philadelphia]] in 1932. Lake's mother, Constance Frances Charlotta (née Trimble; 1902–1992), of Irish descent, married Anthony Keane, a newspaper staff artist, also of Irish descent, in 1933, and Lake began using his surname.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=May 17, 1943|title=I, Veronica|journal=Life|publisher=Time, Inc.|volume=14|issue=20|page=78|issn=0024-3019|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=700EAAAAMBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=veronica%20lake&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Keanes lived in [[Saranac Lake, New York]], where young Lake attended St. Bernard's School for a time, then was sent to [[Villa Maria (school)|Villa Maria]], an all-girls Catholic boarding school in [[Montreal|Montreal, Quebec]], Canada, from which she was expelled. Lake later claimed she attended [[McGill University]] and took a premed course for a year, intending to become a surgeon. With this being included in many press biographies (although she later declared her claim was a fabrication), Lake felt guilty and subsequently apologized to the president of McGill who was simply amused when she explained her habit of self-dramatizing.&lt;ref&gt;Life magazine, 17 May 1943, pg 82&lt;/ref&gt; But when her stepfather fell ill during her second year, the Keane family later moved to [[Miami, Florida]].&lt;ref name="girl" /&gt; Lake attended [[Miami High School]], where she was known for her beauty. She had a troubled childhood and was diagnosed with [[schizophrenia]], according to her mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Chierichetti|2004|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film career==
===Constance Keane===
In 1938, the Keanes moved to [[Beverly Hills, California]], and while briefly under contract with MGM, Lake enrolled in that studio's acting farm, the Bliss-Hayden School of Acting (now the [[Beverly Hills Playhouse]]). She made friends with a girl named Gwen Horn and accompanied her when Horn went to audition at RKO.&lt;ref name="girl" /&gt; She appeared in the play ''Thought for Food'' in January 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=January 29, 1939|title=Current Films|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|page=C4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''She Made Her Bed'', the theatre critic from the ''Los Angeles Times'' called her "a fetching little trick".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Von Blon|first=Katherine|date=August 21, 1939|title=She Made Her Bed|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She also appeared as an extra in a number of movies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=May 17, 1943|title=I, Veronica|journal=Life|publisher=Time, Inc.|volume=14|issue=20|page=77|issn=0024-3019|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=700EAAAAMBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=veronica%20lake&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keane's first appearance on screen was for [[RKO Pictures|RKO]], playing a small role among several coeds in the film ''[[Sorority House (film)|Sorority House]]'' (1939). The part wound up being cut out of the film, but she was encouraged to continue. Similar roles followed, including ''[[All Women Have Secrets]]'', ''[[Young as You Feel (1940 film)|Young as Your Feel]]'', ''[[Forty Little Mothers]]'' and ''[[Dancing Co-Ed]]''. ''[[Forty Little Mothers]]'' was the first time she let her hair down on screen.&lt;ref name="strauss"&gt;{{cite news|title=Veronica Lake, Full Face|last=Strauss|first=Theodore|newspaper=New York Times|date=November 8, 1942|page=X3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She attracted the interest of Fred Wilcox, an assistant director, who shot a test scene of Lake performing from a play and showed it to an agent. The agent, in turn, showed it to producer [[Arthur Hornblow Jr.]] who was looking for a new girl to play the part of a [[Nightclub act|nightclub singer]] in a military drama, ''[[I Wanted Wings]]'' (1940). Still, in her teens, the role would make her a star.&lt;ref name="girl" /&gt; It was Hornblow who changed her name to Veronica Lake. According to him, her eyes, "calm and clear like a blue lake", were the deciding factor in her new name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Veronica Lake is Paramount's Bid for Year's Best Glamor Starlet|journal=LIFE|date=March 3, 1941|volume=10|issue=9|page=83|url=https://books.google.com/?id=IUoEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA82&amp;dq=Constance+Keane+%22veronica+lake%22#v=onepage&amp;q=Constance%20Keane%20%22veronica%20lake%22&amp;f=false|access-date=August 7, 2017|publisher=Time Inc|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stardom===
[[File:Veronica Lake and Joel McCrea in Sullivan's Travels trailer.jpg|thumb|Lake in her first starring role, opposite [[Joel McCrea]] in ''[[Sullivan's Travels]]'' (1941)]]
It was during the filming of ''I Wanted Wings'' that Lake developed her signature look. Lake's long blonde hair accidentally fell over her right eye during a take and created a "peek-a-boo" effect. "I was playing a sympathetic drunk, I had my arm on a table&amp;nbsp;... it slipped&amp;nbsp;... and my hair&amp;nbsp;— it was always baby fine and had this natural break&amp;nbsp;— fell over my face&amp;nbsp;... It became my trademark and purely by accident", she recalled.&lt;ref name="gale" /&gt;

''I Wanted Wings'' was a big hit, The hairstyle became Lake's trademark and was widely copied by women.&lt;ref name=victoria&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=861&amp;dat=19730708&amp;id=zb4bAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=WFoEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5468,1042862|title='Peek-a-Boo' Star Veronica Lake Hepatitis Victim|date=July 8, 1973|newspaper=The Victoria Advocate|page=6-A|access-date=April 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even before the film came out, Lake was dubbed "the find of 1941".&lt;ref name="girl"&gt;{{cite news|date=February 23, 1941|title=Cinderell Girl of '41|newspaper=Chicago Daily Tribune|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; However Lake did not think this meant she would have a long career and maintained her goal was to be a surgeon. "Only the older actors keep on a long time&amp;nbsp;... I don't want to hang on after I've reached a peak. I'll go back to medical school", she said.&lt;ref name="girl" /&gt; Paramount announced two follow up movies, ''China Pass'' and ''[[Blonde Venus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Churchill|first=Douglas|date=April 2, 1945|page=27|title=Warners Buys the Corn is Green |newspaper=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Lake was cast in ''[[Sullivan's Travels]]'' for [[Preston Sturges]] with [[Joel McCrea]]. She had been six months pregnant when filming began.

Paramount put her in a thriller, ''[[This Gun for Hire]]'' (1942); her love interest was Robert Preston, but she shared more scenes with [[Alan Ladd]] and the two of them would be so popular together they would be reteamed in lead roles for three more films.&lt;ref name=deseret&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=336&amp;dat=19480303&amp;id=ASgcAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=-lcEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6715,318905|title=Ladd, Lake Together In 'Saigon'|date=March 3, 1948|newspaper=The Deseret News|page=13|access-date=April 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both had cameos in ''[[Star Spangled Rhythm]]'' (1942), an all-star Paramount movie.

She was meant to be reunited with McCrea in another comedy, ''[[I Married a Witch]]'', (also 1942) produced by Sturges, and directed by [[René Clair]], but McCrea refused to act with her again, reportedly saying "Life's too short for two films with Veronica Lake".&lt;ref&gt;Robert Osborne, Turner Classic Movies, October 6, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Production was delayed, enabling Lake to be reunited with Ladd in ''[[The Glass Key (1942 film)|The Glass Key]]'' (again 1942), replacing [[Patricia Morison]]. The male lead in ''I Married a Witch'' was eventually played by [[Fredric March]] and the resulting movie, like ''The Glass Key'', was successful at the box-office. René Clair, the director of ''I Married a Witch'', said of Lake "She was a very gifted girl, but she didn't believe she was gifted."&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Terkel|1999|p=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lake was meant to co-star with [[Charles Boyer]] in ''Hong Kong'' for Arthur Hornblow, but it was not made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Of Local Origin|newspaper=New York Times|date=October 24, 1941|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; She received acclaim for her part as a suicidal nurse in ''[[So Proudly We Hail!]]'' (1943). At the peak of her popularity, she earned $4,500 a week.&lt;ref name=victoria /&gt;

Although popular with the public, Lake had a complex personality and acquired a reputation for being difficult to work with. [[Eddie Bracken]], her co-star in ''[[Star Spangled Rhythm]]'', in which Lake appeared in a musical number, was quoted as saying, "She was known as 'The Bitch' and she deserved the title."&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Donnelley|2003|p=392}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Parish|Pitts|2003|p=480}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Lake and McCrea did make another film together, the 1947 production [[Ramrod]]. During filming of ''[[The Blue Dahlia]]'' (1946), screenwriter [[Raymond Chandler]] referred to her as "Moronica Lake".&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Hiney|1999|p=154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During World War II, Lake changed her trademark peek-a-boo hairstyle at the urging of the government to encourage women working in war industry factories to adopt more practical, safer hairstyles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2004-10-12-veronica-lake_x.htm|title=Veronica Lake's remains resurface|date=October 12, 2004|website=usatoday.com|access-date=June 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the change helped to decrease accidents involving women getting their hair caught in machinery, doing so may have damaged Lake's career.&lt;ref name="starr2003"&gt;{{harv|Starr|2003|pp=128–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=brenner&gt;{{cite news|last=Brenner|first=John Lanouette|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2209&amp;dat=19670826&amp;id=9K0rAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=kf0FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7213,5706895|title=Veronica Lake Gives Telegraph Exclusive Personal Interview|date=August 26, 1967|newspaper=The Telegraph|page=9|access-date=April 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also became a popular [[Pin-up model |pin-up girl]] for soldiers during World War II and traveled throughout the United States to raise money for [[war bond]]s.&lt;ref name=brenner /&gt;

==Later career==
In June 1944, Lake appeared at a war bond drive in Boston, where her services as a dishwasher were auctioned off. She also performed in a revue, with papers saying her "talk was on the grim side".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tobin Shines As Butler At Bond Lunch: $100,000 Luncheon Served at Tobin Home|newspaper=The Christian Science Monitor|location=Boston|date=June 13, 1944|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hedda Hopper]] later claimed this appearance was responsible for Paramount giving her the third lead in ''[[Out of This World (1945 film)|Out of This World]]'', supporting [[Diana Lynn]], saying "Lake clipped her own wings in her Boston bond appearance ... It's lucky for Lake, after Boston, that she isn't out of pictures".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hopper|first=Hedda|title=Sonny Sings a Song!|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=July 20, 1944|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lake's career faltered with her unsympathetic role as [[Nazism|Nazi]] spy Dora Bruckman in ''[[The Hour Before the Dawn]]'' (1944). Scathing reviews of ''The Hour Before the Dawn'' included criticism of her unconvincing German accent.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} She had begun drinking more heavily during this period, and a growing number of people refused to work with her. Lake had a number of months off work, during which time she lost a child and was divorced. She was brought back in ''[[Bring On the Girls (film)|Bring On the Girls]]'' (1945), Lake's first proper musical, although she had sung in ''This Gun for Hire'' and ''Star Spangled Rhythm''. There were two more movies with Bracken, ''[[Out of This World (1945 film)|Out of This World]]'' and ''[[Hold That Blonde]]'', both also 1945.

[[File:Lake-ladd-trailer.jpg|thumb|left|222px|Lake and [[Alan Ladd]] in trailer for ''[[The Blue Dahlia]]'' (1946)]]
Lake then made two films produced by [[John Houseman]], ''[[Miss Susie Slagle's]]'' and ''[[The Blue Dahlia]]'' (both 1946). While waiting for the films to be released in 1945, she took stock of her career, claiming, "I had to learn about acting. I've played all sorts of parts, taken just what came along regardless of high merit. In fact, I've been a sort of general utility person. I haven't liked all the roles. One or two were pretty bad".&lt;ref name="edwin" /&gt;

One role Lake really liked was ''Hold That Blonde'' (1945), supporting [[Eddie Bracken]] (in a part turned down by Bob Hope). "It's a comedy, rather like what [[Carole Lombard]] used to do ... It represents a real change of pace".&lt;ref name="edwin"&gt;{{cite news|last=Schallert|first=Edwin|date=July 8, 1945|page=C1|title=Change of Pace in Roles Beckons Veronica Lake: Star to Pause at Career's Crossroads Roles to Shift for Veronica|work=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; She thought she had a good part in ''The Blue Dahlia''.&lt;ref name="edwin" /&gt;

Lake expressed interest in renegotiating her deal with Paramount:&lt;blockquote&gt;The studio feels that way about it too. They have indicated they are going to fuss more about the pictures in which I appear. I think I'll enjoy being fussed about&amp;nbsp;... I want this to be the turning point and I think that it will. I am free and clear of unpleasant characters, unless they are strongly justified. I've had a varied experience playing them and also appearing as heroines. The roles themselves haven't been noteworthy and sometimes not even especially spotlighted, but I think they've all been beneficial in one way or another. From here on there should be a certain pattern of development, and that is what I am going to fight for if necessary, though I don't believe it will be because they are so understanding here at Paramount.&lt;ref name="edwin" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

She made her first film outside Paramount since she became a star, a Western, ''[[Ramrod (film)|Ramrod]]'' (1947), directed by her then-husband [[Andre DeToth]], which reunited her with Joel McCrea, despite his earlier reservation. Back at her home studio she had a cameo in ''[[Variety Girl]]'' (1947) then was united with Ladd for the last time in ''[[Saigon (1948 film)|Saigon]]'' (1948), in which she returned to her former peek-a-boo hairstyle; the movie was not particularly well received. Neither was a romantic drama, ''[[Isn't It Romantic? (1948 film)|Isn't It Romantic]]'' (also 1948) or a comedy ''[[The Sainted Sisters]]'' (1948). In 1948 Paramount decided not to renew Lake's contract. {{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

===Leaving Paramount===
Lake moved to [[20th Century Fox]] to make ''[[Slattery's Hurricane]]'' (1949), directed by DeToth. It was only a support role and there were not many other offers. In 1950 it was announced she and DeToth would make ''Before I Wake'' (from a suspense novel by Mel Devrett) and ''Flanagan Boy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Drama: D'Arrast, Glazer Plan Spanish Feature; Power Debates British Stage|last=Schallert|first=Edwin|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=March 11, 1950|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither was made. She appeared in ''[[Stronghold (1951 film)|Stronghold]]'' (1951), which she later described as "a dog", an independent production from [[Robert L. Lippert|Lippert Pictures]] shot in Mexico. She later sued for unpaid wages on the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Veronica Lake, Named as Film Suit Claimant|newspaper =Los Angeles Times|date=March 28, 1962|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lake and DeToth filed for bankruptcy that same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=LncoAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=GMgEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4541,6166208&amp;dq=veronica+lake+andre+de+toth&amp;hl=en|title=Veronica Lake Says She's Bankrupt|date=August 17, 1951|newspaper=Daytona Beach Morning Journal|page=1|access-date=January 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] later seized their home for unpaid taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=R3EzAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=5u4HAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3658,602906&amp;dq=veronica+lake+tax+seized&amp;hl=en|title=Actress Loses Home For Not Paying Tax|date=April 7, 1951|newspaper=Lodi News–Sentinel|page=8|access-date=January 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the verge of a nervous breakdown and bankrupt, Lake ran away, left DeToth, and flew alone to New York.

===New York===
[[File:Veronica Lake still.jpg|thumb|Publicity photo c. 1950s]]
In the summer of 1951, she was fed up; two marriages had failed, and she was typecast in Hollywood as a sex symbol. As a result of her disillusionment with Hollywood and not liking what it did with people, she walked out on Hollywood, took her three children, and headed to New York to restart her career. Lake wanted to leave her sexy image behind, and New York offered the opportunity to work in theater and the new medium, television.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"They said, 'She'll be back in a couple of months,' recalled Lake. "Well I never returned. Enough was enough already. Did I want to be one of the walking dead or a real person?"&lt;ref name="gale" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

She performed in [[summer stock theatre]] and in stage roles in England.&lt;ref name=klemesrud&gt;{{cite news|last=Klemesrud|first=Judy|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=1oIyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=frcFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=894,6028745&amp;dq=veronica+lake+autobiography+brood&amp;hl=en|title=What Ever Happened to Veronica Lake?|date=March 14, 1971|work=The Palm Beach Post|page=C6|access-date=January 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1955, she collapsed in Detroit, where she had been appearing on stage in ''The Little Hut''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1300&amp;dat=19551028&amp;id=-TlVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=nZUDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4458,4305402|title=Veronica Lake In Hospital|date=October 28, 1955|newspaper=The Age|page=1|access-date=April 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==
After her third divorce, Lake drifted between cheap hotels in New York City, and was arrested several times for public drunkenness and disorderly conduct. In 1962, a ''[[New York Post]]'' reporter found her living at the all-women's [[The Redbury New York|Martha Washington Hotel]] in [[Manhattan]], working as a waitress downstairs in the cocktail lounge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=8ToaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=BScEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7223,662510&amp;dq=veronica+lake&amp;hl=en|title=Veronica Lake is a Waitress Now|date=March 22, 1962|newspaper=The Milwaukee Journal|page=11|access-date=April 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was working under the name "Connie de Toth". Lake said she took the job in part because "I like people. I like to talk to them".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Once Glittering Star: Veronica Lake Now Cocktail Waitress|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=March 23, 1962|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reporter's widely distributed story led to speculation that Lake was destitute. After the story ran, fans of Lake sent her money which she returned as "a matter of pride".&lt;ref name=klemesrud /&gt; Lake vehemently denied that she was destitute and stated, "It's as though people were making me out to be down-and-out. I wasn't. I was paying $190 a month rent then, and that's a long way from being broke".&lt;ref name=virginisland&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=757&amp;dat=19730709&amp;id=rrhNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=yUQDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4092,661735|title=Actress Veronica Lake Dies In Vermont Hospital|date=July 9, 1973|work=The Virgin Island Daily News|page=2|access-date=April 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story did revive some interest in Lake and led to some television and stage appearances, most notably in the 1963 off-Broadway revival of the musical ''[[Best Foot Forward (musical)|Best Foot Forward]]''.&lt;ref name=virginisland /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lortel.org/Archives/Production/1429 ''Best Foot Forward'' (1963 Off-Broadway Revival)] at [[Internet Off-Broadway Database]] &lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, she had a brief stint as a television hostess in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], along with a largely ignored film role in ''[[Footsteps in the Snow]]''. She also continued appearing in stage roles.&lt;ref name=brenner /&gt; She went to Freeport in the Bahamas to visit a friend and ended up living there for a few years.&lt;ref name="gale" /&gt;

Lake's memoirs, ''Veronica: The Autobiography of Veronica Lake'', which she dictated to the writer [[Donald Bain (writer)|Donald Bain]], were published in the United Kingdom in 1969, and in the United States the following year. In the book, Lake discusses her career, her failed marriages, her romances with [[Howard Hughes]], [[Tommy Manville]] and [[Aristotle Onassis]], her alcoholism, and her guilt over not spending enough time with her children.&lt;ref name=victoria /&gt; In the book, Lake stated to Bain that her mother pushed her into a career as an actress. Bain quoted Lake, looking back at her career, as saying, "I never did [[Pin-up model|cheesecake]] like [[Ann Sheridan]] or [[Betty Grable]]. I just used my hair". She also laughed off the term "sex symbol" and instead referred to herself as a "sex zombie".&lt;ref name=klemesrud /&gt;
[[File:Veronika-lake-trailer.jpg|thumb|Lake in trailer for her final film ''Flesh Feast'' (1970)]]
When she went to the UK to promote her book in 1969 she received an offer to appear on stage in ''Madam Chairman''.&lt;ref name="gale"&gt;{{cite news|title=Lake: 'To Work ...and to Live': Veronica Lake|last=Gale|first=Bill|newspaper = New York Times|date=August 24, 1969|page=D13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1969, Lake essayed the role of [[Blanche DuBois]] in a revival of ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire]]'' on the English stage; her performance won rave reviews.&lt;ref name=sarasota&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1755&amp;dat=19730708&amp;id=ncEqAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=smYEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7411,3142317|title=Peek-A-Boo Veronica Lake Dies At 51|date=July 8, 1973|work=Sarasota Herald-Tribune|page=9-A|access-date=April 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the proceeds from her autobiography, after she had divided them with Bain, she co-produced and starred in her final film, ''[[Flesh Feast (film)|Flesh Feast]]'' (1970), a low-budget horror movie with a Nazi-myth storyline.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

==Personal life==
After purchasing an airplane for her husband, André de Toth, Lake earned her pilot's license in 1946. She later flew solo between Los Angeles and New York when leaving him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcmdb.com/participant.jsp?participantId=107416|title=Turner Classic Movies|publisher=Tcmdb.com|access-date=October 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marriages and children===
Lake's first marriage was to art director [[John S. Detlie]], in 1940. They had a daughter, Elaine (born in 1941),&lt;ref name=miami&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=vgQtAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=0tMFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3782,207545&amp;dq=veronica+lake+john+s+detlie&amp;hl=en|title=Veronica Lake Wins Divorce|date=December 2, 1943|work=The Miami News|page=1|access-date=January 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a son, Anthony (born July 8, 1943). According to news from the time, Lake's son was born prematurely after she tripped on a lighting cable while filming a movie. Anthony died on July 15, 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=w6IhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=C5gFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1621,1211377&amp;dq=veronica+lake+premature&amp;hl=en|title=Veronica Lake's Baby, Born Prematurely, Dies|date=July 16, 1943|work=Reading Eagle|page=18|access-date=January 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lake and Detlie separated in August 1943 and divorced in December 1943.&lt;ref name=miami /&gt; In 1944, Lake married film director [[Andre DeToth]] with whom she had a son, Andre Anthony Michael III (known as Michael DeToth), and a daughter, Diana (born October 1948). Days before Diana's birth, Lake's mother sued her for support payments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ROk-AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Mk0MAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2220,896226&amp;dq=veronica+lake+andre+de+toth&amp;hl=en|title=Veronica Lake Sued By Mother|date=October 12, 1948|work=The Tuscaloosa News|access-date=January 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lake and DeToth divorced in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=a-YhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=v2QEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3746,539222&amp;dq=veronica+lake+de+toth+divorce&amp;hl=en|title=Veronica Lake Wins Divorce From Director|work=Sarasota Herald-Tribune|publisher=June 3, 1952|page=12|access-date=January 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1955, she married songwriter Joseph Allan McCarthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=a_4yAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=4gAGAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5374,4239700&amp;dq=veronica+lake+joseph+a+mccarthy+divorce&amp;hl=en|title=Veronica Lake Weds Ex-County Tunesmith|date=September 4, 1955|work=The Herald|page=2|access-date=January 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were divorced in 1959. In 1969, she revealed that she rarely saw her children.&lt;ref name="gale" /&gt;

==Death==
In June 1973, Lake returned to the United States and while traveling in Vermont, visited a local doctor, complaining of stomach pains. She was discovered to have [[cirrhosis]] of the liver as a result of her years of drinking, and on June 26, she checked into the [[University of Vermont Medical Center]] in [[Burlington, Vermont|Burlington]].&lt;ref name=sarasota /&gt;

She died there on July 7, 1973, of [[Hepatitis#Acute|acute hepatitis]] and [[acute kidney injury]].&lt;ref&gt;''Vermont Death Records, 1909–2003''. Vermont State Archives and Records Administration, Montpelier, Vermont.&lt;/ref&gt; Her son Michael claimed her body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=sLhNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=yUQDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3440,916647&amp;dq=veronica+lake+memorial+universal+chapel&amp;hl=en|title=Veronica Lake to Be Buried in Islands|date=July 11, 1973|work=The Virgin Islands Daily News|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lake's memorial service was held at the Universal Chapel in New York City on July 11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rites for Miss Lake Today|date=July 11, 1973|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was cremated and, according to her wishes, her ashes were scattered off the coast of the Virgin Islands. In 2004, some of Lake's ashes were reportedly found in a New York antique store.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnston|first=Lauren|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/veronica-lakes-ashes-for-sale|title=Veronica Lake's Ashes For Sale?|date=October 12, 2004|website=cbsnews.com|access-date=April 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hollywood Boulevard==
