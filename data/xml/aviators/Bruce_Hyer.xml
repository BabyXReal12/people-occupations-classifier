'''Bruce Tolhurst Hyer'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bolt.lakeheadu.ca/~lusec/minutes/s97-0514.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716070756/http://bolt.lakeheadu.ca/~lusec/minutes/s97-0514.htm |archivedate=2011-07-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (born August 6, 1946) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] politician, the deputy leader of the [[Green Party of Canada]] and the former Member of Parliament for [[Thunder Bay—Superior North]]. Hyer was elected in the [[Canadian federal election, 2008|2008 federal election]], and re-elected with a wider margin in the [[Canadian federal election, 2011|2011 federal election]]; on both occasions while standing for the [[New Democratic Party]].

==Early life==
Hyer was born in [[Hartford, Connecticut]], United States in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=df92b768-cbe1-4222-9526-8f3fd5d9f540&amp;Language=E Parliamentary Biographies]&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated in 1964 from [[Hall High School (Connecticut)|Hall High School]], and was a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Berkowitz|first1=Michael|title=50th Reunion: Back to School|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-berkowitz/50th-reunion-back-to-scho_b_6065662.html|website=Huffington Post|accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Willimantic, Connecticut]] he worked as a police officer, using his knowledge of Spanish to conduct outreach to the Hispanic community. After graduating from [[Central Connecticut State University]], Hyer helped to create the Connecticut State Department of Environmental Protection, where as a Senior Environmental Analyst, he worked on water and air pollution, land use planning, and was in charge of pesticide registration. He played a key role in banning [[DDT]] and many other of the “dirty dozen” chlorinated pesticides, and ended the spraying of non-selective chemical insecticides in unmanaged forests. At age 29, he moved to Canada to live in the wilderness 40&amp;nbsp;km (25 miles) west of [[Armstrong Station, Ontario]].&lt;ref name="BeyondPolitics"&gt;[http://cpac.ca/forms/index.asp?dsp=template&amp;act=view3&amp;pagetype=vod&amp;hl=e&amp;clipID=5666 "Beyond Politics - Catherine Clark interviews Bruce Hyer"]&lt;/ref&gt;  Hyer lived for two years mostly off the land in the Canadian wilderness; first in a tipi and later in a log cabin he constructed himself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wabakimi.com/stories1.htm WildWaters Nature Tours - A Small Boy's Log Cabin]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978 he moved to Thunder Bay, where he started a retail outdoor and camera store called WildWaters Wilderness Shop. He married Margaret Wanlin in 1993. Their son Michael was born in 1995.&lt;ref name="BeyondPolitics" /&gt;

==Early career==
Hyer has had a number of vocations and avocations, including consultant, wilderness guide, log building and whitewater canoeing instructor, biologist, teacher (high school, college, university), bush pilot, and land use planner.

From the beginning of his days in Canada, Hyer acted as a biologist and entrepreneur in the Thunder Bay area, operating an [[ecotourism|ecotourist]] company with offices in [[Thunder Bay]] and [[Armstrong, Thunder Bay District, Ontario|Armstrong]]. As one of the early tourist operators in the area, Hyer also headed the North of Superior Tourism Board for many years. He received a [[Master of Science]] degree in [[Forestry]] from [[Lakehead University]] in 1997 for his scientific work on the effects of human disturbance on woodland caribou. This work was partially supported by Buchanan Forest Products Limited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hyer|first1=Bruce|title=Experimental Log Hauling Through a Traditional Caribou Wintering Area|journal=Rangifer|date=1998|issue=10|page=256|url=http://septentrio.uit.no/index.php/rangifer/article/view/1562/1467|accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout this period, Hyer worked as a consultant in biodiversity, wildlife biology, and ecotourism, including travelling to Japan in 2004 to work with the government of [[Akita Prefecture]] on the protection and ecotourism planning for of one of Japan's last undammed rivers, the Omonogawa.

==Political career==
Hyer began his professional political career in 2003. In the 2004 election, Hyer almost doubled the vote share received by the NDP and advanced their standing to second place. In the following election in 2006, Hyer came even closer, falling short of the Liberal incumbent [[Joe Comuzzi]] by only 408 votes. In 2008, Hyer was elected to the 40th Canadian Parliament with a 9% lead over the Liberals.

===First term===

After taking his seat in October, 2008, Hyer started work on climate change legislation. On February 10, 2009, Hyer tabled Bill C-311&lt;ref&gt;Climate Change Accountability Act http://www2.parl.gc.ca/Sites/LOP/LEGISINFO/index.asp?Language=E&amp;query=6747&amp;Session=23&amp;List=toc&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Climate Change Accountability Act (Bill C-311)]] as his first [[private member's bill]] in the [[House of Commons of Canada]]. The bill was passed by the House of Commons in a minority Conservative government at 3rd Reading on May 5, 2010 with 149 votes for and 136 votes against.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Doc=40&amp;Language=E&amp;Mode=1&amp;Parl=40&amp;Pub=Hansard&amp;Ses=3#SOB-3144365 |title=Official Report * Table of Contents * Number 040 (Official Version) |publisher=Parl.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2015-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was defeated on November 16, 2010 by a vote of 43 to 32 in the Conservative-controlled Senate; to date, this remains the only bill in Canada's parliamentary history to be passed in the House of Commons, only to be defeated in the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/Content/SEN/Chamber/403/Debates/065db_2010-11-16-E.htm?Language=E&amp;Parl=40&amp;Ses=3#43 |title=Debates - Issue 65 - November 16, 2010 |publisher=Parl.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2015-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brucehyer.ca/meet-bruce |title=Meet Bruce Hyer |publisher=Brucehyer.ca |date= |accessdate=2015-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other bills Hyer has introduced include Bill C-312 the Made in Canada Act,&lt;ref&gt;Made in Canada Act http://www2.parl.gc.ca/Sites/LOP/LEGISINFO/index.asp?Language=E&amp;query=5716&amp;Session=22&amp;List=toc&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Cell Phone Freedom Act]]&lt;ref&gt;Cell Phone Freedom Act http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Docid=4640240&amp;file=4&lt;/ref&gt; and a number of motions including the Northwest Ontario Passenger Rail Motion,&lt;ref&gt;Northwest Ontario passenger Rail Motion {{cite web|url=http://www.ReviveSuperiorRail.ca/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706202217/http://www.revivesuperiorrail.ca/ |archivedate=2011-07-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which mandates the return of [[Via Rail]] service to the north shore of [[Lake Superior]] and to Thunder Bay. Hyer served as the NDP's small business and tourism critic from 2008 to 2011.

===Second term===
In the [[Canadian federal election, 2011|2011 election]], Hyer was re-elected with 49.8% of the vote, 7,000 votes more than his nearest opponent. Following his re-election, the issue of the long gun registry was tabled in the House of Commons. As he had promised voters over four elections, Hyer voted in favour of ending the registration of hunting rifles and shotguns, given that all legal firearm owners were already licensed and registered themselves under the Possession and Acquisition Licence (PAL). This move was viewed unfavourably within the NDP, even though firearm registration was not mentioned in party policies or platforms.  As a result of his decision, Hyer was stripped of his critic roles, barred from international travel on House business and was no longer given the opportunity to speak in the House. On April 23, 2012 Hyer announced he would sit as an [[Independent (politician)|independent]], which he remained for a year and a half.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bruce Hyer quits NDP caucus to sit as an Independent|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/bruce-hyer-quits-ndp-caucus-to-sit-as-an-independent-1.1170157|publisher=CBC News|accessdate=May 29, 2018|date=April 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Green Party===
On December 13, 2013, Hyer announced that he would join the [[Green Party of Canada]], doubling the number of members the party has in the House of Commons by joining the leader of the party, [[Elizabeth May]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/thunder-bay-mp-bruce-hyer-joins-green-party-doubles-caucus-1.2462983|title=Thunder Bay MP Bruce Hyer joins Green Party, doubles caucus|date=December 13, 2013|accessdate=December 13, 2013|publisher=[[CBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hyer gave as reasoning for his decision that: the Green Party has the best leader and platform; and that they are the only party in Parliament that is truly democratic, allowing Green MPs to put their constituents and conscience before party control. One year later, on December 13, 2014, Hyer was acclaimed as the Green Party candidate for the [[Thunder Bay—Superior North]] riding in the [[Canadian federal election, 2015|2015 election]]. On October 19, 2015, he lost the election to Liberal Party candidate [[Patty Hajdu]], getting only 13.8% of the votes.
