'''Nevil Shute Norway''' (17 January 1899{{spaced ndash}}12 January 1960) was an English novelist and  [[aeronautical engineer]] who spent his later years in Australia. He used his full name in his engineering career and '''Nevil Shute''' as his pen name to protect his engineering career from any potential negative publicity in connection with his novels, which included ''[[On the Beach (novel)|On the Beach]]'' and ''[[A Town Like Alice]]''.

== Early life ==
Born in Somerset Road, [[Ealing]], [[Middlesex]]&lt;!-- Do not change to London, Ealing was in Middlesex in 1899 --&gt;, he was educated at the [[Dragon School]], [[Shrewsbury School]] and [[Balliol College, Oxford]]; he graduated from Oxford University in 1922 with a third-class degree in engineering science. Shute's father, Arthur Hamilton Norway, became head of the Post Office in Ireland before the First World War and was based at the main post office in Dublin in 1916 at the time of the [[Easter Rising]]. Shute himself was later commended for his role as a stretcher-bearer during the rising.&lt;ref name="A. P. Ryan"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ryan|first1=A. P.|title=Extract from the Dictionary of National Biography 1951–1960|url=http://www.nevilshute.org/Biography/dictionarynationalbio.php|website=Nevil Shute Foundation|accessdate=23 April 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150902014922/http://www.nevilshute.org/Biography/dictionarynationalbio.php|archivedate=2 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 June 1915 his elder brother, Fredrick Hamilton Norway, aged 19, was wounded at Epinette, near [[Armentières]], and was evacuated to [[Wimereux]] where he died, on 4 July, with his parents by his side. He was buried at Wimereux Communal Cemetery, [[Pas-de-Calais]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nevilshute.org/PhotoLine/PLD-1911-1920/pl-1911-1920-02.php|title=Photo Timeline: 1911–1920 page 2|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419073441/http://www.nevilshute.org/PhotoLine/PLD-1911-1920/pl-1911-1920-02.php|archivedate=19 April 2012|deadurl=no|publisher=Nevil Shute Foundation|accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shute attended the [[Royal Military Academy, Woolwich]], but because of his [[Stuttering|stammer]] was unable to take up a commission in the [[Royal Flying Corps]], instead serving in the [[World War I|Great War]] as a soldier in the [[Suffolk Regiment]].&lt;ref name="A. P. Ryan" /&gt;

== Career in aviation ==
An [[aerospace engineering|aeronautical engineer]] as well as a pilot, he began his engineering career with the [[De Havilland Aircraft Company]]. (He used his pen-name as an author to protect his engineering career from any potential negative publicity in connection with his novels.)&lt;ref&gt;''Slide Rule: Autobiography of an Engineer'' (1954) {{ISBN|1-84232-291-5}} pages 44–45; (1964) p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dissatisfied with the lack of opportunities for advancement, he took a position in 1924 with [[Vickers#Aviation|Vickers Ltd.]], where he was involved with the development of [[airship]]s, working as Chief Calculator ([[stress engineer]]) on the [[R100]] airship project for the Vickers subsidiary Airship Guarantee Company. In 1929 he was promoted to Deputy [[Chief Engineer]] of the R100 project under [[Barnes Wallis]] and when Wallis left the project he became the Chief Engineer.&lt;ref name="A. P. Ryan" /&gt;

The R100 was a prototype for passenger-carrying airships that would serve the needs of Britain's empire. The government-funded but privately developed R100 made a successful 1930 round trip to Canada. While in Canada it made trips from [[Montreal]] to [[Ottawa]], Toronto and [[Niagara Falls]]. The fatal 1930 crash in France of its government-developed counterpart [[R101]] ended British interest in [[dirigibles]]. The [[Secretary of State for Air]], [[Christopher Thomson, 1st Baron Thomson|Lord Thomson]], was killed in the crash along with several senior figures in the airship development program.&lt;ref name="A. P. Ryan" /&gt; The R100 was immediately grounded and subsequently scrapped. Shute gives a detailed account of the development of the two airships in his 1954 autobiographical work, ''[[Slide Rule: Autobiography of an Engineer|Slide Rule]]''. His account is very critical of the R101 design and management team, and strongly hints that senior team members were complicit in concealing flaws in the airship's design and construction.  In ''The Tender Ship,'' [[Manhattan Project]] engineer and [[Virginia Tech]] professor [[Arthur Squires]] used Shute's account of the R100 and R101 as a primary illustration of his thesis that governments are usually incompetent managers of technology projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Tender Ship|last=Squires|first=Arthur|publisher=Birkhauser|year=1986|isbn=|location=|pages=3–10|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1931, with the cancellation of the R100 project, Shute teamed up with the talented de Havilland trained designer [[A. H. Tiltman|A. Hessell Tiltman]] to found the aircraft construction company [[Airspeed Ltd]].&lt;ref name="A. P. Ryan" /&gt;

A site was available in a former [[trolleybus]] garage on Piccadilly, [[York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stead|first1=Mark|title=New aviation museum planned for city centre|url=http://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/10765852.New_aviation_museum_planned_for_city_centre/|work=[[The Press (York)|The Press]]|date=26 October 2013|location=York|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150714012006/http://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/10765852.New_aviation_museum_planned_for_city_centre/|archivedate=14 July 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite setbacks, including the usual problems of a new business, Airspeed Limited eventually gained recognition when its [[Airspeed Envoy|Envoy]] aircraft was chosen for the [[King's Flight]]. With the approach of war, a military version of the Envoy was developed, to be called the [[Airspeed Oxford]]. The Oxford became the standard advanced multi-engined trainer for the RAF and British Commonwealth, with over 8,500 being built.

For the innovation of developing a hydraulic retractable undercarriage for the [[Airspeed Courier]], and his work on R100, Shute was made a Fellow of the [[Royal Aeronautical Society]].

On 7 March 1931, Shute married Frances Mary Heaton, a 28-year-old medical practitioner. They had two daughters, Heather and Shirley.

== Second World War==
By the outbreak of the [[World War II|Second World War]], Shute was already a rising novelist. Even as war seemed imminent he was working on military projects with his former boss at Vickers, [[Charles Dennistoun Burney|Sir Dennistoun Burney]]. He was commissioned into the [[Royal Naval Reserve|Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve]] as a sub-lieutenant and quickly ended up in what would become the [[Directorate of Miscellaneous Weapons Development]]. There he was a head of engineering, working on secret weapons such as [[Panjandrum]], a job that appealed to the engineer in him.  He also developed the [[RP-3#Anti-submarine|Rocket Spear]], an anti-submarine missile with a fluted cast iron head.  After the first U-boat was sunk by it, [[Charles Goodeve]] sent him a message concluding "I am particularly pleased as it fully substantiates the foresight you showed in pushing this in its early stages.  My congratulations."&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Pawle (1957), ''Secret Weapons of World War II'' (original title, ''The Secret War''), 1967 reprint, New York:  Ballantine, Part II, "The Enemy under the Waters", Ch. 18, "Harrying the U-boats", pp. 183-186.&lt;/ref&gt;

His celebrity as a writer caused the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]] to send him to the [[Normandy Landings]] on 6 June 1944 and later to [[Burma]] as a correspondent. He finished the war with the rank of lieutenant commander in the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserves ([[RNVR]]).

== Literary career ==
Shute's first novel, ''[[Stephen Morris (novel)|Stephen Morris]]'', was written in 1923, but not published until 1961.

His first published novel was ''Marazan'', which came out in 1926. After that he averaged one novel every two years through the 1950s, with the exception of a six-year hiatus while he was establishing his own aircraft construction company, Airspeed Ltd. His popularity grew slowly with each novel, but he became much more famous after the publication of ''On the Beach'' in 1957.

Shute's novels are written in a simple, highly readable style, with clearly delineated plot lines. Where there is a romantic element, sex is referred to only obliquely. Many of the stories are introduced by a narrator who is not a character in the story. The most common theme in Shute's novels is the [[dignity of work]], spanning all classes, whether an Eastern European bar "hostess" (''Ruined City'') or brilliant [[boffin]] (''[[No Highway]]'').

Another recurrent theme is the bridging of social barriers such as class (''[[Lonely Road (novel)|Lonely Road]]'' and ''Landfall''), race (''[[The Chequer Board]]''), or religion (''[[Round the Bend (1951 novel)|Round the Bend]]''). The Australian novels are individual hymns to that country, with subtle disparagement of the mores of the United States (''[[Beyond the Black Stump]]'') and overt antipathy towards the post-World War II socialist government of Shute's native Britain (''[[The Far Country (1952 novel)|The Far Country]]'' and ''[[In the Wet]]'').

Shute's heroes tended to be like himself: middle class solicitors, doctors, accountants, bank managers, engineers, generally university graduates. However (as in ''[[Trustee from the Toolroom]]''), Shute valued the honest artisans and their social integrity and contributions to society more than the contributions of the upper classes.

Aviation and engineering provide the backdrop for many of Shute's novels. He identified how engineering, science, and design could improve human life and more than once used the anonymous epigram, "It has been said an engineer is a man who can do for five shillings what any fool can do for a pound."&lt;ref&gt;Quote from Shute's autobiography ''Slide Rule'', 2nd ed., London: Pan, 1969, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;

Several of Shute's novels explored the boundary between accepted science and rational belief, on the one hand, and [[mystical]] or [[paranormal]] possibilities, including [[reincarnation]], on the other hand. Shute did this by including elements of fantasy and science fiction in novels that were considered mainstream. They included [[Buddhist astrology]] and folk prophecy in ''The Chequer Board''; the effective use of a [[ouija board]] in ''No Highway;'' a [[messiah]] figure in ''Round the Bend''; reincarnation, science fiction, and Aboriginal psychic powers in ''In the Wet.''

Twenty-four of his novels and novellas have been published. Many of his books have been adapted for the screen, including ''Lonely Road'' [[The Lonely Road|in 1936]]; ''Landfall: A Channel Story'' [[Landfall (film)|in 1949]]; ''[[Pied Piper (novel)|Pied Piper]]'' [[The Pied Piper (1942 film)|in 1942]], 1959, and as ''Crossing to Freedom,'' a CBS [[made-for-television]] movie, in 1990; ''On the Beach'' [[On the Beach (1959 film)|in 1959]] and [[On the Beach (2000 film)|in 2000]] as a two-part miniseries; and ''No Highway'' [[No Highway in the Sky|in 1951]].  ''A Town Like Alice'' was adapted [[A Town Like Alice (1956 film)|in 1956]] and serialized for [[Australian television]]  [[A Town Like Alice (miniseries)|in 1981]], and was broadcast on [[BBC Radio 2]] in 1997 starring [[Jason Connery]], [[Becky Hindley]], [[Bernard Hepton]] and [[Virginia McKenna]]. Shute's 1952 novel ''[[The Far Country (novel)|The Far Country]]'' was filmed for television as six one-hour episodes in 1972, and as a two-part [[miniseries]] in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first = Scott|last = Murray|title = Australia on the small screen, 1970-1995: The complete guide to tele-features and mini-series|publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]|year = 1996|page = 193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vintage Books]] reprinted all 23 of his books in 2009.&lt;ref name="Telegraph London"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hensher|first1=Philip|title=Nevil Shute: profile|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/6718768/Nevil-Shute-profile.html|accessdate=12 April 2013|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=4 December 2009|location=London|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602021929/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/6718768/Nevil-Shute-profile.html|archivedate=2 June 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shute's final work was published more than 40 years after his death.  ''[[The Seafarers (novel)|The Seafarers]]'' was first drafted in 1946–47, subsequently rewritten, and then put aside. In 1948, Shute again rewrote it, changing the title to ''Blind Understanding,'' but he left the manuscript incomplete.  According to Dan Telfair in the foreword of the 2002 edition, some of the themes in ''The Seafarers'' and ''Blind Understanding'' were used in Shute's 1955 novel ''[[Requiem for a Wren]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|contributor-last = Telfair|contributor-first = Dan|contribution = Foreword|last = Shute|first = Nevil|title = The Seafarers |publisher = [[Paper Tiger Books]]|year = 2002|isbn = 9781889439327|url = https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Seafarers.html?id=fMgUPQAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post war activities ==
In 1948, Shute flew his own [[Percival Proctor]] airplane to Australia and back, accompanied by the writer [[James Riddell (skier)|James Riddell]], who published a book, ''Flight of Fancy,'' based on the trip, in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nevilshute.org/Reviews/flightoffancy.php|title=Nevil Shute Foundation—Title|last=|first=|date=|website=Nevil Shute Foundation|access-date=7 December 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171207140722/https://www.nevilshute.org/Reviews/flightoffancy.php|archivedate=7 December 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On his return, concerned about what he saw as the decline of his home country, he decided that he and his family would emigrate to Australia. In 1950, he settled with his wife and two daughters on farmland at [[Langwarrin]], south-east of [[Melbourne]].&lt;ref&gt;Croft (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; Remembering his 1930 trip to Canada and his decision to emigrate to Australia, he wrote, in 1954, "For the first time in my life I saw how people live in an English-speaking country outside England." &lt;ref&gt;''Slide Rule'', (1964), pp. 113–114.&lt;/ref&gt; Although he intended to remain in Australia, he did not apply for [[Australian citizenship]], which was at that time a mere formality because he was a [[British subject]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Citizenship in Australia – Fact sheet 187|url=http://www.naa.gov.au/collection/fact-sheets/fs187.aspx|publisher=National Archives of Australia|accessdate=28 December 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130122112713/http://naa.gov.au/collection/fact-sheets/fs187.aspx|archivedate=22 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s and 1960s he was one of the world's best-selling novelists, although his popularity has since declined in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Meacham|first1=Steve|title=Remaindered with little honour in his adopted land|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/07/24/1058853193968.html|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=25 July 2003|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080507021356/http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/07/24/1058853193968.html|archivedate=7 May 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1956 and 1958 in Australia, he took up car racing as a hobby, driving a white [[Jaguar XK140]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Photo Timeline 1951–1960 page 5|url=http://www.nevilshute.org/PhotoLine/PLD-1951-1960/pl-1951-1960-05.php|publisher=Nevil Shute Norway Foundation|accessdate=11 June 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419180231/http://www.nevilshute.org/PhotoLine/PLD-1951-1960/pl-1951-1960-05.php|archivedate=19 April 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of this experience found its way into his book ''On the Beach ''.

Shute died in Melbourne in 1960 after a stroke.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,939151,00.html "Books: The Two Lives of Nevil Shute"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110220011228/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,939151,00.html |date=20 February 2011 }}, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', 25 January 1960.
