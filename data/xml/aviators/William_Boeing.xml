'''William Edward Boeing''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|oʊ|ɪ|ŋ}}; October 1, 1881 – September 28, 1956) was an [[United States|American]] [[aviation]] pioneer who founded [[The Boeing Company]] in 1916.

==Early life==
Boeing was born in [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]] to Marie M. Ortmann, from [[Vienna, Austria]], and Wilhelm Böing (1846–1890)&lt;!--, a wealthy mining engineer,--&gt; from [[Hagen-Hohenlimburg|Hagen-Hohenlimburg, Germany]].&lt;ref name=web/&gt; From a successful family, Wilhelm Böing emigrated to the [[United States]] in 1868 and initially worked as a laborer.&lt;ref name=hlink06&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.historylink.org/File/8023 |work=HistoryLink |last1=Schultz |first1=John |last2=Wilma |first2=David |title=Boeing, William Edward (1881-1956) |date=December 21, 2006 |accessdate=July 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His move to America was not popular with his father and he received no financial support. He later made a fortune from [[Laurentian Mixed Forest Province|North Woods]] timber lands and mineral rights near [[Lake Superior]].&lt;ref name=web&gt;{{cite web|title=Biography of William E. Boeing|publisher=[[Boeing]]|url=http://www.boeing.com/resources/boeingdotcom/history-biography/pdf/william-e-boeing-biography.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1890, at age eight, the younger Boeing lost his father to [[influenza]], and his mother soon remarried.&lt;ref name=hlink06/&gt; He attended school in [[Europe]] at [[Vevey]], [[Switzerland]], and returned to the U.S. for a year of prep school in [[Boston]].&lt;ref name=hlink06/&gt; He [[Anglicisation|anglicized]] his name to "William Boeing"{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} and enrolled at [[Yale University]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut]].&lt;ref&gt;From the PBS documentary "Pioneers in Aviation: The Race for the Moon Episode I; The Early Years"&lt;/ref&gt; He left Yale in 1903 before graduating to go into the lumber business.

==Career==
Boeing moved to the [[Pacific Northwest]] at [[Hoquiam, Washington]], and purchased extensive timberlands around [[Grays Harbor]] on the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] (west) side of the [[Olympic Peninsula]] and also bought into lumber operations. He made a success of the venture, in part by shipping lumber to the East Coast via the new [[Panama Canal]], generating funds that he would later apply to a very different business.&lt;ref name=BeebMundo&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-36676196 The Panama Canal's unexpected winners], BBC Mundo, July 4, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

While president of Greenwood Timber Company, Boeing, who had experimented with boat design, traveled to [[Seattle]], where, during the [[Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition]] in 1909, he saw a manned flying machine for the first time and became fascinated with [[aircraft]]. Boeing decided to take lessons at the [[Glenn L. Martin]] Flying School in Los Angeles and he purchased one of Martin's planes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Schefke, Brian. [http://www.immigrantentrepreneurship.org/entry.php?rec=66 "William Edward Boeing."] In ''Immigrant Entrepreneurship: German-American Business Biographies, 1720 to the Present'', vol. 4, edited by Jeffrey Fear. German Historical Institute. Last modified June 3, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Martin pilot [[James Floyd Smith]] traveled to Seattle to assemble Boeing's new [[Glenn L. Martin Company|Martin TA hydroaeroplane]] and continue to teach its owner to fly. Huge crates arrived by train, and Smith assembled the plane in a tent hangar erected on the shore of Lake Union. William Boeing became a pilot. Boeing's test pilot, Herb Munter, soon damaged the plane. When he was told by Martin that replacement parts would not become available for months, Boeing told his friend Cdr. [[George Conrad Westervelt]] (USN), "We could build a better plane ourselves and build it faster". Westervelt agreed. They soon built and flew the [[B &amp; W Seaplane]], an amphibian biplane that had outstanding performance. Boeing decided to go into the aircraft business and bought an old boat works on the [[Duwamish River]] near Seattle for his factory.

===Founding of Boeing Aircraft===
In 1916, Boeing went into business with [[George Conrad Westervelt]] as "B &amp; W" and founded the Pacific Aero Products Co. The company's first plane was the [[Boeing Model 1|Boeing Model 1 (B &amp; W Seaplane)]]. When America entered the [[World War I|First World War]] on April 8, 1917, a little more than a month later, Boeing changed the name from Pacific Aero Products Co. to [[Boeing Airplane Company]]&lt;ref name=web/&gt; and obtained orders from the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] for 50 planes. At the end of the war, Boeing began to concentrate on commercial aircraft. He secured contracts to supply [[airmail]] service, and built a successful airmail operation and later passenger service that evolved into [[United Airlines]].

==Boeing family==
In 1921, Boeing married Bertha Marie Potter Paschall (1891-1977). She had previously been married to Nathaniel Paschall, a real estate broker with whom she had two sons, Nathaniel "Nat" Paschall Jr. and Cranston Paschall, and these two became Boeing's stepsons. The couple had a son of their own, [[William E. Boeing Jr.]] (1922–2015).&lt;ref name=bbjobit&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.seattletimes.com/business/bill-boeing-jr-son-of-jetmakerrsquos-founder-dies-at-92/ |work=Seattle Times |last=Gates |first=Dominic |title=Bill Boeing Jr., son of jetmaker’s founder, dies at 92  |date=January 8, 2015 |accessdate=July 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fndgrbbj&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=141092752 |work=Find a Grave |title=William Edward "Bill" Boeing, Jr |accessdate=July 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stepsons went into aviation manufacturing as a career. Nat Paschall was a sales manager for competitor [[Douglas Aircraft]], later  [[McDonnell Douglas]]. Bill Jr. became a noted private pilot and industrial real estate developer.&lt;ref name=bbjobit/&gt;

Bertha Potter Paschall Boeing was the daughter of Howard Cranston Potter and Alice Kershaw Potter. Through her father, Bertha was a descendant of merchant bankers Alexander Brown of Baltimore, James Brown and Brown's son-in-law and partner [[Howard Potter]] of New York; and through her mother, the granddaughter of [[Charles James Kershaw]] and Mary Leavenworth Kershaw (a descendant of [[Henry Leavenworth]]).

==Breakup of Boeing Group==
In 1929, Boeing joined with [[Frederick Rentschler]] of [[Pratt &amp; Whitney]] to form [[United Aircraft and Transport Corporation]]. The new grouping was a [[vertical integration|vertically integrated]] company with interests in all aspects of aviation, intending to serve all aviation markets. In a short time, it bought a host of small airlines, merging them with Boeing's pioneering airline under a holding company, [[United Airlines|United Air Lines]].

In 1934, the [[United States government]] accused William Boeing of [[antitrust|monopolistic practices]]. The same year, the [[Air Mail Act]] forced airplane companies to separate flight operations from development and manufacturing. William Boeing divested himself of ownership as his holding company, [[United Aircraft and Transport Corporation]], broke into three separate entities:

* United Aircraft Corporation, holding the former eastern US manufacturing (now [[United Technologies Corporation]])
* [[Boeing Airplane Company]], with western US manufacturing, which later became [[The Boeing Company]]
* [[United Airlines|United Air Lines]] for flight operations

He began investing most of his time in his horses in 1937.
Boeing Airplane Company, though a major manufacturer in a fragmented industry, did not really become successful until the beginning of [[World War II]].

==Later life==
[[File:Portrait, Boeing, William E.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Portrait of Boeing]]
Between 1935 and 1944, William Boeing and his wife Bertha set aside a large tract of land north of the Seattle city limits for subdivision, including the future communities of Richmond Beach, Richmond Heights, Innis Arden, Blue Ridge and Shoreview.&lt;ref name="taylor"&gt;{{cite book|title=Toxic Communities|first=Dorceta E.|last=Taylor|authorlink=Dorceta Taylor|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York|year=2014|isbn=978-1-479-86178-1|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Boeings placed racially restrictive covenants on their land to enforce segregation, forbidding properties from being "sold, conveyed, rented, or leased in whole or in part to any person not of the White or Caucasian race." Non-whites could only occupy a property on the land if they were employed as a domestic servant "by a person of the White or Caucasian race."&lt;ref name=taylor/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Homeowners find records still hold blot of racism|date=June 3, 2005|first=Lornet|last=Turnbull|work=[[The Seattle Times]]|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/homeowners-find-records-still-hold-blot-of-racism/|accessdate=April 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boeing retired from the aircraft industry. He then spent the remainder of his years in property development and thoroughbred [[horse breeding]]. Concerned about the possibility of World War II battles in the [[Pacific Northwest]], he purchased a {{convert|650|acre|adj=on}} farm in the countryside east of Seattle, which he dubbed "Aldarra". The estate remained in the family until most of the land was sold and developed into a [[golf course]] in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/sports/article/From-The-Bunkers-It-s-an-exclusive-Aldarra-1052892.php |title=From The Bunkers: It's an exclusive: Aldarra opens on May 4 |first=Dan |last=Raley |newspaper=Seattle Post-Intelligencer |date=April 23, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several acres, however, remained in the family, including the Boeing's own and two smaller houses. His primary residence for most of his life, however, was a mansion in [[The Highlands (Seattle)|The Highlands]] community close to Seattle; the [[William E. Boeing House]] was later listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nps.gov/articles/william-e-boeing-house.htm|title=William E. Boeing House|publisher=[[National Park Service]]|accessdate=August 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Boeing Creek]] running near this property bears his name.

William Boeing died on September 28, 1956, at the age of 74, just three days before his 75th birthday, and a year before the first successful commercial jet airliner, the [[Boeing 707]], would take its first flight. He was pronounced [[dead on arrival]] at the Seattle Yacht Club, having had a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] aboard his [[yacht]] in [[Puget Sound]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=William Boeing, Plane Pioneer, 74.

He was posthumously inducted into the [[National Aviation Hall of Fame|Aviation Hall of Fame]] in [[Dayton, Ohio]], in 1966.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1984, Boeing was inducted into the [[International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame]] at the [[San Diego Air &amp; Space Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;Sprekelmeyer, Linda, editor.
