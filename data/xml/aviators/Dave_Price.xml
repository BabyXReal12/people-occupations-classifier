He was quoted by Newsday as saying "The chance to rejoin Fox 5 and be a part of the ‘Good Day New York’ family again was one I couldn't pass up. I've been friends with Rosanna [Scotto] forever and to be honest—it's tough to get a table at Fresco—so this will help a lot. I can't wait to start the day with our viewers and provide all the news and information they need and maybe a few smiles and laughs each morning, too. It doesn't get much better than this. I'm raring to go.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/tv/tv-zone-1.811968/channel-5-shakeup-anastos-out-at-10-dave-price-returns-1.3811134|title=Channel 5 shakeup: Anastos out at 10; Dave Price returns|work=Newsday|accessdate=5 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
