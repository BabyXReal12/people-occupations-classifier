==Education and scientific career==
Holland attended [[Pacifica High School (Garden Grove, California)|Pacifica High School]] in [[Garden Grove, California]], where he graduated as class [[valedictorian]] in 1984. During high school, Holland was the best student in mathematics in his year, and he found it "just as exciting as punk rock."&lt;ref name="Bravo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reocities.com/CollegePark/2638/Offspring/bravo.html|title=An Interview with Dexter Holland|work=Bravo|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then attended the [[University of Southern California]], where he earned a [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] degree in biology and an [[Master of Science|M.S.]] degree in molecular biology, and commenced a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in molecular biology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themortonreport.com/entertainment/music/smart-rock-stars/ |title=Greg Graffin PhD and Smart Rock Stars by Jaan Uhelszki |publisher=themortonreport.com |date=May 19, 2011 |accessdate=2012-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after the success of [[The Offspring]], he suspended his candidature to focus on music. Holland had said in 1995 that, when he turns 40, he would rather be a professor at a university than play music.&lt;ref name="Bravo"/&gt;

Holland was a doctoral student at the Laboratory of Viral Oncology and Proteomics Research, [[Keck School of Medicine]], where he was supervised by Professor Suraiya Rasheed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N46mokeEZxI|title=Dexter Holland Discusses His Recently Published Paper 3/22/2013|first=|last=Suzy Tilley|date=March 22, 2013|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2013, Holland and co-authors published a paper in ''[[PLoS One]]'' regarding [[microRNA]] in HIV [[genomes]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kroq.cbslocal.com/2013/03/21/dexter-holland-from-the-offspring-publishes-research-paper-what-the-heck-is-it-about/ |title=Dexter Holland from The Offspring Publishes Research Paper…What the Heck Is It About? |publisher=KROQ |date = March 21, 2013 |accessdate=2013-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; titled "Identification of Human MicroRNA-Like Sequences Embedded within the Protein-Encoding Genes of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus".&lt;ref&gt;Bryan Holland, Jonathan Wong, Meng Li, Suraiya Rasheed. (2013.) [http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0058586 "Identification of Human MicroRNA-Like Sequences Embedded within the Protein-Encoding Genes of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus"], ''PLoS One'', 8(3):1–10.&lt;/ref&gt; The original [[academic paper]] describes the use of [[Computational biology|computational molecular biological]] (''[[in silico]]'') approaches to identify [[microRNA]]-like sequences in HIV. These sequences are suggested to have evolved to self-regulate survival of the virus in the host by evading its immune responses and thus influence the persistence, replication, and pathogenicity of HIV. Holland was awarded his Ph.D. degree in molecular biology during the USC Commencement on May 12, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis |last=Holland |first=Bryan |title=Discovery of mature microRNA sequences within the protein-coding regions of global HIV-1 genomes: predictions of novel mechanisms for viral infection and pathogenicity  |date=2017-04-20 |degree=Ph.D. |publisher=University of Southern California |url=http://digitallibrary.usc.edu/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15799coll40/id/364391/rec/1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musical career==
[[File:DexterPiano.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Dexter Holland performing in 2009.]]
Holland's early influences include [[Aerosmith]], [[The Beatles]], the [[Sex Pistols]], the [[Ramones]], [[Kiss (band)|KISS]], [[Bob Marley]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]], and [[The Rolling Stones]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indian.ruvr.ru/2012_12_29/Dexter-Holland-turns-47/|title=Dexter Holland turns 47|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After he met friend and cross-country teammate [[Greg Kriesel|Greg K.]], they started a local punk band called Manic Subsidal in 1983, where he played the drums. It formed after the duo failed to get into a [[Social Distortion]] concert in 1984. After Jim Benton was hired as their drummer, Holland switched to both vocals and guitars. They never released any albums, but some demos have existed online.

After some line-up changes, Manic Subsidal changed their name to [[The Offspring]] in 1985. After recording a demo in 1988,&lt;ref name="NIPPbio"&gt;[http://www.nipp.com/artists/detail/the-offspring The Offspring] at NIPP, obtained November 10, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The Offspring signed a deal with a small-time label, [[Nemesis Records]], for whom they recorded their first full-length album, ''[[The Offspring (album)|The Offspring]]'', in March 1989.&lt;ref name="NIPPbio" /&gt; This album would eventually be re-issued on November 21, 1995 by Holland's own record label, Nitro Records.

In 1991, The Offspring signed with [[Epitaph Records]] (home of [[Bad Religion]], [[L7 (band)|L7]], [[NOFX]], [[Pennywise (band)|Pennywise]] and other similar bands). Their first release on the label was ''[[Ignition (The Offspring album)|Ignition]]'', which was released in 1992. Their last album for that label was 1994's ''[[Smash (The Offspring album)|Smash]]'', which still holds the world record for most sales of an album on an independent label.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.offspring.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/Offspring.woa/wa/bio |title=Greatest Hits Bio (2005) |publisher=Offspring.com |accessdate=August 18, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311090427/http://www.offspring.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/Offspring.woa/wa/bio |archivedate=March 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The band then signed with [[Columbia Records]] in 1996 (although Dexter claims that [[Brett Gurewitz]], owner of Epitaph and guitarist for [[Bad Religion]], sold the contract to Columbia&lt;ref name="Dexter Holland Letter to Offspring Mailing List"&gt;{{cite web |url=//members.aol.com/delirium4u/offspring/letter1.txt |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=January 21, 2007 |accessdate=2011-11-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070121115627/http://members.aol.com/delirium4u/offspring/letter1.txt |archivedate=January 21, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;) for whom they released their next six albums, ''[[Ixnay on the Hombre]]'' (1997), ''[[Americana (The Offspring album)|Americana]]'' (1998), ''[[Conspiracy of One]]'' (2000), ''[[Splinter (The Offspring album)|Splinter]]'' (2003), ''[[Rise and Fall, Rage and Grace]]'' (2008), and their most recent, ''[[Days Go By (The Offspring album)|Days Go By]]'' (2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=New Offspring Single And Album |date=April 23, 2012 |url=http://www.offspring.com/news | publisher=offspring.com | accessdate=2012-04-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dexter Holland sometimes plays the piano during live shows. Occasionally the band plays "[[Gone Away (song)|Gone Away]]", with only Dexter playing the song on piano. Holland sings in the tenor range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://diffuser.fm/dexter-holland-airplanes/ |title=Offspring's Dexter Holland Can't Afford All of His Airplanes |date=May 26, 2014 |publisher=Diffuser.fm |accessdate=December 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business interests==
[[File:Gringobandito.jpg|thumb|Dexter Holland's "Gringo Bandito", his own brand of [[hot sauce]] with his picture on it.]]
Holland has his own brand of [[hot sauce]] named Gringo Bandito&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-ca-offspring15-2008jun15,0,1497135.story |title=Why don't you get a job? by Geoff Boucher, LA Times, June 15, 2008 |publisher=Latimes.com |date=June 15, 2008 |accessdate=2011-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and featuring Holland with bandoliers, revolvers, a sombrero and shades—as a possible homage to the logo for [[Tapatío hot sauce]] or [[Pancho Villa]].&lt;ref name="OCWeekly"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ocweekly.com/2010-03-04/food/dexter-holland-gringo-bandito/full/|title=How Far Can Dexter Holland's Gringo Bandito Go?|work=OC Weekly|date=March 4, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141113154536/http://www.ocweekly.com/2010-03-04/food/dexter-holland-gringo-bandito/full/|archivedate=November 13, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gringo Bandito was launched in late 2006, after Holland, who grew up in [[Southern California]] where [[Mexican cuisine]] is considered a "part of the way of life", wondered "if [he] could do [a hot sauce] better".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/features/la-fo-hotsauce7-2009jan07,0,5131325.story#axzz2nVm5mJYV|title=Rocker Dexter Holland's spicy offspring: Gringo Bandito hot sauce|first=Geoff|last=Boucher|date=January 7, 2009|work=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the conception of the hot sauce, Holland states that in the early 2000s, while eating Mexican food, he began to read the label of a bottle of [[Tapatío hot sauce|Tapatío]]; "It just clicked that I had to make one," he says. "People who like hot sauce are a certain type of people. They're passionate. They'll have a bottle with them wherever they go. I'm one of those people. And when I'm into something, I really get into it. It's like my music—I liked records, so I learned how to play a guitar. After that? A band".&lt;ref name="OCWeekly"/&gt;

In 2015, they hosted a Gringo Bandito Taco-eating challenge at [[Jason Acuña|Weeman]]'s Chronic Tacos in [[Redondo Beach, California|Redondo Beach]] featuring professional eater [[Takeru Kobayashi|Kobayashi]].

The headquarters for Gringo Bandito are located in a [[Huntington Beach]] [[industrial park]], next to The Offspring's recording studio.&lt;ref name="OCWeekly"/&gt;

He is also the co founder of the record label [[Nitro Records]] which he operated from 1994 to 2013.

==Philanthropy==
In 1997, Holland and former [[Dead Kennedys]] singer [[Jello Biafra]] teamed up to form the F.S.U. Foundation, which raised funds through charity concerts. The foundation did benefit shows to raise money for various charities including [[AIDS Project Los Angeles]], Poor People's United Fund, Trees Foundation, and [[Amnesty International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1425698/jello-biafra-dexter-holland-get-charitable.jhtml|title=Jello Biafra And Dexter Holland Get Charitable|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Holland participated in the 2006 and 2008 [[Los Angeles Marathon]]; his charity of choice was the [[Innocence Project]], a non-profit legal clinic that handles legal cases where post-conviction [[DNA profiling#DNA evidence as evidence in criminal trials|DNA testing of evidence]] can yield conclusive proof of innocence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.athlinks.com/myresults.aspx?rid=5846712 |title=Athlinks search – Bryan Holland |publisher=Athlinks.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Holland was married to hairstylist Kristine Luna. She co-wrote the song "Session" from the ''[[Ignition (The Offspring album)|Ignition]]'' album and also appears in the Offspring music video "I Choose." Holland and Luna met in 1992, married in 1995,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=g}}&lt;/ref&gt; and divorced in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.purevolume.com/news/The-Offspring-Dexter-Holland-PureVolume-Exclusive-Interview| title=The PV Q&amp;A: The Offspring's Dexter Holland on Making Punk Music as the "Days Go By"| publisher=PureVolume| date=September 25, 2012}}http://www.theoffspringsite.com/tos/en/index.php?page=band&amp;sub=member&amp;persID=lg_d3Xt3rP|title=Dexter Holland|publisher=The Offsprin}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfexaminer.com/sanfrancisco/older-wiser-angrier-offspring/Content?oid=2127527| title=Older, wiser, angrier Offspring| first=Tom| last=Lanham| work=San Francisco Examiner| date=September 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He married Amber Sasse in 2013.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
