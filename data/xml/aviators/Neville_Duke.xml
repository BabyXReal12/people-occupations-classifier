[[Squadron Leader]] '''Neville Frederick Duke''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|sep=,|DSO|OBE|DFC2|AFC|FRAeS}} (11 January 1922 – 7 April 2007) was a British test pilot and [[fighter ace]] of the [[Second World War]]. He was the most successful Western Allied ace in the [[Mediterranean Theatre of Operations|Mediterranean Theatre]], and was credited with the destruction of 27 enemy aircraft. After the end of the war, Duke was acknowledged as one of the world's foremost [[test pilot]]s. In 1953, he became holder of the world [[air speed record]] when he flew a [[Hawker Hunter]] at {{convert|727.63|mph|kph|abbr=on}} over [[Littlehampton]].

==Early life==
Duke was born in [[Tonbridge]], [[Kent]], and educated at the Convent of [[St Mary]] and [[The Judd School]] in Tonbridge. One of the four houses at Judd is now named after him, following the reinstating of a house system to the school in 2008. He started working as an auctioneer and estate agent before attempting to join the [[Fleet Air Arm]] on his 18th birthday.  He was rejected and joined the RAF instead as a cadet in June 1940.

==Second World War==
===Initial combat===
Duke underwent pilot training and was commissioned at No.&amp;nbsp;58 Operational Training Unit, [[Grangemouth]] in February 1941, before being posted to [[No. 92 Squadron RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;92 Squadron]] at [[Biggin Hill]] in April, flying [[Supermarine Spitfire]] Mk Vs.  Operating over occupied Europe, Duke's obvious talents as a fighter pilot meant he often flew as wingman to Biggin Hill's [[wing leader]], Wing Commander [[Adolph Malan|Adolph "Sailor" Malan]]. By August 1941, Duke had claimed two [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]]s shot down. When the unit was withdrawn for a rest in October 1941, Duke was posted to North Africa to fly with [[No. 112 Squadron RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;112 Squadron]] on the [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk|Curtiss Tomahawk]].

===Desert operations===
[[File:Royal Air Force- Italy,the Balkans and South-east Europe, 1942-1945. CNA3177.jpg|thumb|Duke (left) during WWII]]
Duke found flying the P-40 less agreeable than the Spitfire, and on a familiarisation flight crashed ''AM390''.&lt;ref name="Thomas 2005, p. 15"&gt;Thomas 2005, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 November 1941, Duke was shot down by the high scoring German ace ''[[Oberfeldwebel]]'' Otto Schulz from [[Jagdgeschwader 27]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas 2005, pp. 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 December, he was again shot down by a pilot from JG 27. However, his own tally of victories continued to mount and, after the squadron was re-equipped with the more capable [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk|Curtiss Kittyhawk]], by February 1942, Duke had at least eight victories, resulting in the award of the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] (DFC) in March. These victories included a [[Fiat CR.42]] and a Bf 109 on 20 and 21 December.&lt;ref name="Thomas 2005, p. 15"/&gt; He completed his first tour of operations the next month and then spent six months instructing at the fighter school in the [[Suez Canal|Canal Zone]].

In November 1942, Duke rejoined 92 Squadron, which has been transferred to North Africa flying the tropicalised [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire Mark V]].&lt;ref group=Note&gt;For an explanation of different Spitfire marks, see [[Supermarine Spitfire variants]]&lt;/ref&gt; He became a flight commander in February 1943 and received a [[Distinguished Service Order]] in March. By the end of his second tour in June, Duke had amassed a further 14 victories to his total and was awarded a [[Medal bar|bar]] to his DFC.

Promoted to [[squadron leader]], Duke was posted to [[No. 73 Operational Training Unit]] at [[Abu Sueir]] as chief flying instructor before returning to operations in March 1944 for his third tour, as [[commanding officer]] of [[No. 145 Squadron RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;145 Squadron]] in Italy, flying [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire Mk VIII]]s. He claimed five more aircraft shot down in May, gaining a second bar to his DFC. On 7 June, Duke was shot down by [[flak]] and baled out into [[Lake Bracciano]], almost drowning when unable to release his parachute harness. He sheltered with [[Italian partisans]] until U.S. troops arrived.

Downing two [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190|Fw 190]]s of [[Organization of the Luftwaffe (1933-1945)#Geschwader|Schlachtgeschwader 4]] in May, Duke scored his final kills on 7 September 1944, becoming the Mediterranean Theatre's top Allied fighter ace at the age of 22.  In 486 sorties and some 712 operational hours, he claimed 27 outright victories and two shared, one probable, six damaged and two shared destroyed on the ground.&lt;ref&gt;Shores and Williams 1994, p. 234.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Test pilot==
Duke returned to the UK and took up a position as test pilot for [[Hawker Aircraft|Hawker]] in January 1945. He attended No 4 Course at the [[Empire Test Pilots' School]] at [[Cranfield]] in 1946 and then joined the RAF's [[High Speed Flight RAF|High Speed Flight unit]], commanded by [[Edward Mortlock Donaldson|Teddy Donaldson]]. It was Donaldson who set a new official world air speed record on 7 September 1946, later being the first official man to break the 1,000&amp;nbsp;km/h barrier.  After demonstrating a [[Gloster Meteor]] at an air display in Prague, he was presented with the [[Czechoslovak War Cross 1939-1945|Czech War Cross]] for his wartime service.

Duke was awarded the [[Air Force Cross (United Kingdom)|Air Force Cross]] recognising his test flying from 1947–1948 at the [[Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment]] at [[Boscombe Down]], where he flew research flights to explore aircraft performance at high [[Mach number]]s and high altitudes.  Duke resigned from the RAF in August 1948, joining the [[Royal Auxiliary Air Force]], flying Spitfires and Meteors from Biggin Hill. He was CO of [[No. 615 Squadron RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;615 Squadron]] in 1950 and 1951, whose honorary [[air commodore]] was [[Winston Churchill]].

Duke joined Hawker as an assistant chief test pilot in 1948, and became Hawker's chief test pilot in 1951, following the death of [[Trevor Sidney Wade|"Wimpy" Wade]], his predecessor.  He was particularly involved in the development of the highly successful [[Hawker Hunter]], flying the [[Hawker Hunter|Hawker P1067]] in its trials in July 1951. He gave a display in the new fighter at the [[Farnborough Airshow]] on 6 September 1952, shortly after [[1952 Farnborough Airshow DH.110 crash|a prototype de Havilland DH 110]], piloted by his friend [[John Derry]], had broken up in flight, killing Derry and his observer Tony Richards, along with 28 spectators.  "My dear Duke", the Prime Minister wrote to him the next day, "it was characteristic of you to go up yesterday after the shocking accident. Accept my salute. Yours, in grief, Winston Churchill."

Duke was appointed an [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] in January 1953 for his contribution to supersonic flight and ground breaking achievements at Hawker. On 7 September 1953, Duke set a new [[Flight airspeed record|world air speed record]] of {{convert|727.63|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}, flying Hunter ''WB188''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://speedrecordclub.com/records/outair.htm |title="Air Speed Records." |accessdate=2011-03-10 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013142357/http://speedrecordclub.com/records/outair.htm |archivedate=13 October 2007 |df=dmy-all }} ''Outright Records'' via ''web.archive.org.'' Retrieved: 10 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; (With this world record Neville Duke exceeded the unofficial world record set by Heini Dittmar with the [[Messerschmitt Me 163#Later versions|Me 163 BV18]])&lt;ref&gt;Käsemann 1999, pp. 47, 122, 128 World records.&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded the [[Queen's Commendation for Valuable Service in the Air]] for saving his aircraft after an engine failure in August 1955.  Two days later, Duke fractured his spine following a forced landing in a Hunter at [[Thorney Island (West Sussex)|Thorney Island]].  Another heavy landing in May 1956 caused further spinal injuries; he was forced to resign in October 1956 after being immobilised for several months.

==Later life==
Duke married Gwendoline Fellows in 1947.

Duke took up freelance aviation consultancy work until 1960, when he formed Duke Aviation Limited.  He was Sir [[George Dowty]]'s personal pilot for most of the 1960s and 1970s.  He sold the company in 1982. He also became a test pilot for Edgley Aircraft and later Brooklands Aircraft on the [[Edgley Optica]] and Brooklands Firemaster 65.

Duke wrote several books based on his experiences.  His autobiography, ''Test Pilot'', was published in 1953 and reprinted in 1992.  His other books include ''The Sound Barrier'' (1953), ''The Crowded Sky'' (1959) and ''The War Diaries of Neville Duke'' (1995).  He was awarded the [[Royal Aero Club]]'s Gold Medal, and was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Aeronautical Society]] in 1993. In 2002, he received the [[Air League]]'s [[Jeffrey Quill Medal]] and the Award of Honour from the [[Guild of Air Pilots and Navigators]] for "his unique and incomparable record".

Duke became one of the vice presidents of the [[Eagle Club]], formed by the ''[[Eagle (comic)|Eagle]]'' magazine, in 1950, and many schoolboys from that era came to know of Duke through this association.  It is speculated that "[[Dan Dare|Dan Dare, Pilot of the Future]]" may have been inspired by Duke's achievements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buzzle.com/articles/134079.html "Squadron Leader Neville Duke, Obituary: Fighter ace and record-breaking test pilot who played a key role in the development of the Hawker Hunter."]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''Guardian News &amp; Media 2008'' via ''Buzzle.com'', 13 April 2007. Retrieved: 6 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Duke was honorary president of [[Tangmere Military Aviation Museum]], where his record-breaking Hunter is displayed.

After three burglaries, Duke sold his war medals in 2006 when the costs of insuring them became prohibitive.  He denied press reports that he needed the money to pay for a hip operation for his wife Gwen.  On 7 April 2007, the couple were flying their private aircraft when Duke became ill. He landed safely at [[Popham Airfield]], but collapsed as he left the aircraft. He was taken by ambulance to hospital in [[Basingstoke]] where he was diagnosed as suffering from an [[aneurysm]]. He was transferred to [[St Peter's Hospital, Chertsey]], Surrey, and died later that same evening after an operation, at the age of 85.
