Chesley Sullenberger was born in [[Denison, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.biography.com/people/chesley-sullenberger-20851353 "Chesley Sullenberger"]. [[Biography.com]]. Retrieved August 1, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  His father was a descendant of [[Swiss people|Swiss-German]] immigrants named Sollenberger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bernerzeitung.ch/region/emmental/Held-vom-Hudson-stammt-aus-Wynigen/story/11891131|title="Held vom Hudson" stammt aus Wynigen|date=January 20, 2009|work=[[Berner Zeitung]]|language=English|accessdate=January 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has one sister, Mary. The street on which he grew up in Denison was named after his mother's family. According to his sister, Sullenberger built model planes and [[aircraft carrier]]s during his childhood, and says he became interested in flying after seeing military jets from an Air Force base near his house.&lt;ref name=Rivera&gt;{{cite news |first=Ray |last=Rivera |title=In a Split Second, a Pilot Becomes a Hero Years in the Making |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/17/nyregion/17pilot.html?hp |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=January 16, 2009 |accessdate=January 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went to school in Denison, and was consistently on the 99th [[percentile]] in every academic category.&lt;ref name=FOXNewsTwo&gt;{{cite web |title = Hero Pilot's Records, IQ Scores Released by School District in 'Accident' |publisher=[[Fox News]] |date = January 16, 2009 |url = http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,480250,00.html| accessdate=January 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sullenberger was appointed to the [[United States Air Force Academy]], entering with the Class of 1973 in June 1969.

Following completion of his graduate degree at Purdue, he was assigned to UPT at [[Columbus AFB]], Mississippi, flying the [[T-37 Tweet]] and [[T-38 Talon]]. After earning his wings in 1975 as a [[U.S. Air Force aeronautical rating|USAF Pilot]], he completed replacement training in the [[F-4 Phantom II]] at [[Luke AFB]], Arizona.
