'''Percy Sinclair Pilcher''' (16 January 1866 – 2 October 1899) was a British inventor and pioneer aviator who was his country's foremost experimenter in unpowered flight at the end of the nineteenth century.

He was planning a flight with a motor-driven [[hang glider]], but died in the crash of another glider before he could make the attempt.

His memorial is in a field opposite [[Stanford Hall, Leicestershire|Stanford Hall]].

==Early life==
Percy Pilcher was born in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] in 1866, and served in the [[Royal Navy]] for seven years from 1880.  Thereafter he became an apprentice with the shipbuilders, Randolph, Elder and Company, of Govan in [[Glasgow]].&lt;ref name="geo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottish-places.info/people/famousfirst894.html |title=Percy Sinclair Pilcher|work=The Gazetteer for Scotland|publisher=The Institute of Geography, University of Edinburgh.|accessdate=29 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
[[Image:Hawk hangglider Pilcher.jpg|thumb|200px|The hang glider ''The Hawk'', 1897. Shown might be Miss Dorothy Pilcher, Percy's cousin who was towed in a flight.]] In 1891 Pilcher began work as assistant lecturer at [[Glasgow University]] and took a growing interest in aviation. He built a [[History of hang gliding|hang glider]] called ''The Bat'' which he flew for the first time in 1895;&lt;ref name="geo"/&gt; 
Later that year Pilcher met [[Otto Lilienthal]], who was the leading expert in gliding in Germany. These discussions led to Pilcher building two more gliders, ''The Beetle'' and ''The Gull''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spartacus-educational.com/SCIpilcher.htm|title=Percy Pilcher|publisher=Spartacus|accessdate=29 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the work of his mentor Otto Lilienthal, in 1897 Pilcher built a glider called ''The Hawk'' with which he broke the world distance record when he flew 250&amp;nbsp;m (820&amp;nbsp;ft) at the grounds of [[Stanford Hall (Lutterworth)|Stanford Hall]] near [[Lutterworth]] in [[Leicestershire]], England.

Pilcher set his sights upon powered flight: he developed a [[triplane]] that was to be powered by a 4 [[Horsepower|hp]] (3&amp;nbsp;kW) engine; however, construction of the triplane put him heavily into debt, and Pilcher needed sponsorship to complete his work.

Pilcher formed a company with [[Walter Gordon Wilson]], who was later to become a successful motor engineer and credited by the 1919 [[Royal Commission on Awards to Inventors]] as the co-inventor of the [[tank]], along with [[Sir William Tritton]].

==Death==
On 30 September 1899, having completed his triplane, he had intended to demonstrate it to a group of onlookers and potential sponsors in a field near Stanford Hall.  However, days before, the engine crankshaft had broken and, so as not to disappoint his guests, he decided to fly the Hawk instead.  The weather was stormy and rainy, but by 4&amp;nbsp;pm Pilcher decided the weather was good enough to fly.&lt;ref&gt;'Mr Leicester'. 2008. The Rise and fall of Percy Pilcher. Leicester Mercury Saturday 2 February pp 16–17.)&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst flying, the tail snapped and Pilcher plunged 10 metres (30&amp;nbsp;ft) to the ground: he died two days later from his injuries with his triplane having never been publicly flown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2003/dec/01/theairlineindustry.g2|title=Soaring ambition|last=Burkeman|first=Oliver|date=1 December 2003|work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=29 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is buried in [[Brompton Cemetery]], west London.

==Legacy==
A stone monument to him stands in the field near Stanford Hall at the point where he crashed, and a full-sized replica of his "The Hawk" glider is also displayed at Stanford Hall. The original Hawk has survived and is in the collections of [[National Museums Scotland]].

Pilcher is one of the unsuccessful aviation pioneers mentioned in the [[Marc Blitzstein]] composition [[Airborne Symphony|The Airborne Symphony]].

In 2011 he was one of seven inaugural inductees to the [[Scottish Engineering Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.engineeringhalloffame.org/listing-2.html |title=Scottish Engineering Hall of Fame 2011 Inductees (2)|publisher=Scottish Engineering Hall of Fame|year=2012 |accessdate=June 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pilcher's plans were lost for many years, and his name was also long forgotten except by a few enthusiasts. When the centenary of the [[Wright brothers]]' flight approached, a new effort was made to find the lost work, and some correspondence was found in a private American collection. From this it was possible to discern the general direction of his plans and the basis of his design. Based on Lilienthal's work, Pilcher understood how to produce lift using winglike structures, but at this time a full mathematical description was years away, so many elements were still missing.

In particular, Pilcher was stuck trying to design a wing that could lift the weight of an engine, the aircraft itself and the occupant&amp;nbsp;– each increase in wing area increased the weight so much that yet more lift was required, requiring a larger wing&amp;nbsp;– a seemingly vicious circle. Pilcher's breakthrough, thanks to correspondence with another pioneer, [[Octave Chanute]], was to stack smaller, lighter wings one atop the other in an arrangement we know today as the biplane or triplane. This allowed the wings to generate much more lift without a corresponding increase in weight.

In 2003, a research effort carried out at the School of Aeronautics at [[Cranfield University]], commissioned by the [[BBC2]] television series "[[Horizon (BBC TV series)|Horizon]]", has shown that Pilcher's design was more or less workable, and had he been able to develop his engine, it is possible he would have succeeded in being the first to fly a heavier-than-air powered aircraft with some degree of control.&lt;ref name=Horizon&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/horizon/2003/percypilchertrans.shtml
|title=Percy Pilcher's Flying Machine&amp;nbsp;–  transcript|work=Horizon|publisher=BBC |accessdate=29 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Cranfield built a replica of Pilcher's aircraft and added the Wright brothers' innovation of wing-warping as a safety backup for roll control. Pilcher's original design did not include aerodynamic controls such as ailerons or elevator. After a very short initial test flight piloted by the aircraft designer Bill Brookes, the craft achieved a sustained flight of 1 minute and 25 seconds, compared to 59 seconds for the Wright Brothers' best flight at [[Kitty Hawk, North Carolina|Kitty Hawk]]. This was achieved under dead calm conditions as an additional safety measure;&lt;ref name=Horizon/&gt;
the Wrights in 1903 flew in a 20&amp;nbsp;mph+ wind to achieve sufficient airspeed.
