'''Craig Ferguson''' (born 17 May 1962) is a Scottish-American television host, comedian, author and actor. He was the host of both the [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] game show ''[[Celebrity Name Game]]'' (2014–2017), for which he has won two [[Daytime Emmy Awards]], and of ''[[Join or Die with Craig Ferguson]]'' (2016) on [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History]].&lt;ref name="deadline20160106"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://deadline.com/2016/01/join-or-die-craig-ferguson-premiere-date-historytca-1201676991/ |title='Join Or Die With Craig Ferguson' Gets Premiere Date on History |publisher=Deadline.com |first=Erik |last=Pedersen |date=6 January 2016 |accessdate=15 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also the host of the [[CBS]] [[late-night talk show]] ''[[The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson]]'' (2005–2014). In 2017 he released a web show with his wife Megan, titled ''Couple Thinkers''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vulture.com/2017/10/gant-couple-thinkers-web-series.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLbs8SHnHZM&lt;/ref&gt; It ran for six episodes from  October 9, 2017. It is available on [[YouTube]].

After starting his career in Britain with music, comedy and theatre, Ferguson moved to the United States where he appeared in the role of [[Nigel Wick]] on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] sitcom ''[[The Drew Carey Show]]'' (1996–2004). He has written and starred in three films, directing one of them, and has appeared in several others, including several voice-over roles for animations. Ferguson has also written two books: ''[[Between the Bridge and the River]]'', a novel, and ''[[American on Purpose]]'', a memoir. He was [[naturalised]] as a [[Citizenship in the United States|United States citizen]] in 2008.

==Early life and education==
Ferguson was born in [[Stobhill Hospital]], in the [[Springburn]] district of [[Glasgow]], to Robert and Janet Ferguson, on 17 May 1962,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Monitor |journal=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=17 May 2013 |issue=1259 |pages=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tennant-about"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://talkshows.about.com/od/craigferguson/p/BioCraig.htm |title=Bio Brief: Craig Ferguson |publisher=About.com |first=Thomas |last=Tennant |accessdate=6 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and raised in nearby [[Cumbernauld]], growing up "chubby and bullied".&lt;ref name="nyt09"/&gt;{{sfn |Ferguson |2009 |pp=14–15}} When he was six months old, he and his family moved from their Springburn flat to a [[council house]] in Cumbernauld. They lived there as Glasgow was re-housing many people following [[Clydebank Blitz|damage to the city from World War II]].{{sfn |Ferguson |2009 |pp=14–15}}  Ferguson attended Muirfield Primary School&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hubsouthwestscotland.co.uk/news/134-new-cumbernauld-community-centre-handed-over&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.knowhere.co.uk/Cumbernauld/North-Lanarkshire/Scotland/messages&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Cumbernauld High School]].{{sfn |Ferguson |2009 |p=31}} At age sixteen, Ferguson left Cumbernauld High School and began an apprenticeship to be an electronics technician at a local factory of American company [[Burroughs Corporation]].{{sfn |Ferguson |2009 |pp=66–68}}

His first visit to the United States was in 1975 when he was 13 to visit an uncle who lived on [[Long Island]], near New York City.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJWlNPq0ftM |title=Craig Ferguson Eulogizes his Father |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=17 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he moved to New York City in 1983, he worked in construction in [[Harlem]].&lt;ref name="Great Scot"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20144925,00.html |title=Great Scot |journal=Entertainment Weekly |first=Ken |last=Tucker |issue=958 |date=12 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn |Ferguson |2009 |p=110}} Ferguson later became a bouncer at the nightclub [[Save the Robots]].{{sfn |Ferguson |2009 |pp=112–113}}

==Career==

===UK career===
Ferguson's experience in entertainment began as a drummer in a rock band called Exposure. He then joined a [[punk rock|punk]] band called The Bastards from Hell. The band, later renamed "Dreamboys", and fronted by vocalist [[Peter Capaldi]], performed regularly in Glasgow from 1980 to 1982.&lt;ref name="AmericanOnPurpose"&gt;{{harvnb|Ferguson|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ferguson credits Capaldi for inspiring him to try comedy.&lt;ref name="nyt09"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/04/books/review/Borowitz-t.html |title=The&amp;nbsp;Scotsman |work=The New York Times |first=Andy |last=Borowitz |authorlink=Andy Borowitz |date=1 October 2009 |accessdate=6 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a nerve-wracking first appearance, he decided to create a character that was a "parody of all the über-patriotic native folk singers who seemed to infect every public performance in Scotland".&lt;ref name="nyt09"/&gt; The character, "Bing Hitler" (actually coined by Capaldi as Ferguson started under the name "Nico Fulton" but admittedly later stole the name for his "own nefarious ends"),&lt;ref name="AmericanOnPurpose"/&gt; premiered in Glasgow, and subsequently became a hit at the 1986 [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]].  A recording of his stage act as Bing Hitler was made at Glasgow's Tron Theatre and released in the 1980s;&lt;ref name="inlay"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.discogs.com/Bing-Hitler-Live-At-The-Tron/release/2150881 |title=Bing Hitler: Live at the Tron |publisher=discogs |accessdate=21 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Bing Hitler monologue ("A Lecture for [[Burns Night]]") appears on the compilation cassette ''[[Honey at the Core]].''

After enjoying success at the [[Edinburgh Festival]], Ferguson appeared on television as 'Confidence' in ''[[Red Dwarf]]'', [[STV (TV channel)|STV]]'s ''Hogmanay Show'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scotlandontv.tv/scotland_on_tv/video.html?vxSiteId=60fdd544-9c52-4e17-be7e-57a2a2d76992&amp;vxChannel=Culture%20On%20Stage&amp;vxClipId=1380_SMG1264&amp;vxBitrate=300 |title=Craig Ferguson stand-up comedy clip |work=ScotlandonTV.tv |publisher=SMG Productions |accessdate=23 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008110318/http://www.scotlandontv.tv/scotland_on_tv/video.html?vxSiteId=60fdd544-9c52-4e17-be7e-57a2a2d76992&amp;vxChannel=Culture%20On%20Stage&amp;vxClipId=1380_SMG1264&amp;vxBitrate=300 |archivedate=8 October 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1993 ''[[One Foot in the Grave]]'' Christmas special ''One Foot in the Algarve.'' In 1990 a pilot was broadcast ''The Craig Ferguson Show'', a one-off comedy pilot for [[Granada Television]], which co-starred [[Paul Whitehouse]] and [[Helen Atkinson-Wood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|id=0398895|title=The Craig Ferguson Show |accessdate=6 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by Ferguson's own 1992 show ''2000 Not Out''. In 1993, Ferguson presented a series on Scottish archaeology for [[Scottish Television]] entitled ''Dirt Detective.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scotlandontv.tv/scotland_on_tv/video.html?vxSiteId=60fdd544-9c52-4e17-be7e-57a2a2d76992&amp;vxChannel=History%20Archaeology&amp;vxClipId=1380_SMG124&amp;vxBitrate=300 |title=Craig Ferguson in Dirt Detective |work=ScotlandonTV.tv |publisher=SMG Productions |accessdate=22 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008110434/http://www.scotlandontv.tv/scotland_on_tv/video.html?vxSiteId=60fdd544-9c52-4e17-be7e-57a2a2d76992&amp;vxChannel=History%20Archaeology&amp;vxClipId=1380_SMG124&amp;vxBitrate=300 |archivedate=8 October 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; He travelled throughout the country examining archaeological history, including [[Skara Brae]] and [[Paisley Abbey]]. He will return to UK television for the first time in 25 years &lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-40769271&lt;/ref&gt; in a guest role in [[BBC Scotland|BBC Scotland's]] comedy ''[[Still Game]]'' in 2017,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-40769271|title=US host Ferguson to appear in Still Game|date=2017-07-30|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-01-26|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; to be shown in 2018.

Ferguson also found success in musical theatre. Beginning in 1991, he appeared on stage as Brad Majors in the London production of ''[[The Rocky Horror Show]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rockymusic.org/album/rhs-vocalselections.php |title=The Rocky Horror Show Vocal Selections Book &amp; CD |publisher=Rockymusic.org |accessdate=7 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, Ferguson played Father MacLean in  production of ''[[Bad Boy Johnny and the Prophets of Doom]]'' at the [[Union Chapel, Islington|Union Chapel]] in London. The same year, he appeared again at the Edinburgh Fringe, as Oscar Madison in ''[[The Odd Couple (play)|The Odd Couple]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/29/arts/television/29fergus.html |title=Late Night Transplant Looks Back at His Path |work=[[The New York Times]] |first=Bill |last=Carter |date=29 September 2009 |accessdate=6 November 2009 |quote=We did it exactly the same except for soccer references instead of baseball, and we brought down the house every night.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===US career===
Ferguson moved to Los Angeles in November 1994 after his soon-to-be agent Rick Siegel saw Ferguson during the [[Edinburgh Festival]] and suggested he come to America.{{sfn|Ferguson|2009|loc=ch. 31}} His first US role was as baker Logan McDonough on the short-lived 1995 [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] comedy ''[[Maybe This Time]]'', which starred [[Betty White]] and [[Marie Osmond]].

His breakthrough in the US came when he was cast on ''[[The Drew Carey Show]]'' as the title character's boss, Mr. Wick, a role that he played from 1996 to 2003. He played the role with an over-the-top posh English accent "to make up for generations of English actors doing crap Scottish accents". In his comedy special "A Wee Bit O' Revolution", he specifically identified [[James Doohan]]'s portrayal of Montgomery Scott on ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' as the foundation of his "revenge". (At the end of one episode, though, Ferguson broke the [[fourth wall]] and began talking to the audience at home in his regular Scottish accent.) His character was memorable for his unique methods of laying employees off, almost always "firing Johnson", the most common last name of the to-be-fired workers.&lt;ref name="sunday"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/scotland/article3868137.ece |title=Craig Ferguson 'may be next Letterman' |work=[[The Sunday Times]] |first=Mark |last=Macaskill |date=4 May 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517065353/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/scotland/article3868137.ece |archivedate=17 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even after leaving the show in 2003, he remained a recurring character on the series for the last two seasons, and was part of the two part series finale in 2004.

During production of ''The Drew Carey Show'', Ferguson devoted his off-time as a cast member to writing, working in his trailer on set in between shooting his scenes. He wrote and starred in three films: ''[[The Big Tease]]'', ''[[Saving Grace (2000 film)|Saving Grace]]'', and ''[[I'll Be There (2003 film)|I'll Be There]]'', which he also directed and for which he won the Audience Award for Best Film at the Aspen, Dallas and Valencia film festivals. He was named Best New Director at the Napa Valley Film Festival. These were among other scripts that, "... in the great tradition of the movie business, about half a dozen that I got paid a fortune for but never got made."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Episode dated 17 February 2009 |series=[[Conversations with Michael Eisner]] |network=[[CNBC]] |date=17 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His other acting credits in films include ''[[Niagara Motel]]'', ''[[Lenny the Wonder Dog]]'', ''[[Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events]]'', ''[[Chain of Fools (film)|Chain of Fools]]'', ''[[Born Romantic]]'', ''[[The Ugly Truth (film)|The Ugly Truth]]'', ''[[Kick-Ass (film)|Kick-Ass]]'', and as a [[voice-over]] actor, ''[[How to Train Your Dragon (film)|How to Train Your Dragon]]'', ''[[How to Train Your Dragon 2]]'', ''[[Brave (2012 film)|Brave]]'', and ''[[Winnie the Pooh (2011 film)|Winnie the Pooh]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tribute.ca/people/craig-ferguson/2559/|title=Craig Ferguson biography and filmography {{!}} Craig Ferguson movies|website=Tribute.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ferguson has been touring the United States and Canada with a comedy show since the late 2000s, including a performance at [[Carnegie Hall]] on 23 October 2010 and a performance at [[Radio City Music Hall]] on 6 October 2012. He has performed two stand-up television specials on [[Comedy Central]], both released on DVD: ''A Wee Bit o' Revolution'' in 2009 and ''Does This Need to Be Said?'' in 2011. His third comedy special, ''[[I'm Here to Help]]'', was released on [[Netflix]] in 2013, garnering positive reviews on 4 out of 5 stars on Netflix and peaking at number 6 on [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] top comedy albums.&lt;ref name="netflix2013"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Craig_Ferguson_I_m_Here_to_Help/70270530 |title=Craig Ferguson: I'm Here to Help |publisher=Netflix |accessdate=7 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="billboard2013"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/5638642/craig-ferguson/chart |title=Craig Ferguson: Chart History |work=Billboard |accessdate=7 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also received a [[56th Annual Grammy Awards|2014 Grammy Award]] nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album|Best Comedy Album]].&lt;ref name="billboard20131206"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/5819883/grammy-awards-2014-full-nominations-list-complete-nominees |title=Grammy Awards 2014: Full Nominations List |work=Billboard |date=6 December 2013 |accessdate=7 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ferguson was awarded the [[Peter Ustinov]] Comedy Award by the [[Banff World Media Festival]] on 11 June 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://variety.com/2013/tv/markets-festivals/banff-to-honor-craig-ferguson-with-ustinov-award-1200354756/ |title=Banff to Fete Craig Ferguson with Ustinov Comedy Award |work=Variety |first=Shalini |last=Dore |date=12 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Late Late Show''===
&lt;!-- This section should be short; details belong in the show's article --&gt;
{{Main article|The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson}}
In December 2004, it was announced that Ferguson would be the successor to [[Craig Kilborn]] on [[CBS]]'s ''The Late Late Show''. His first show as the regular host aired on 3 January 2005. By May 2008, Ben Alba, an American television historian and an authority on US talk shows, said Ferguson "has already made his mark, taking the TV [[monologue]] to new levels with an underlying story.  But he is only just starting ... He is making up his own rules: It's the immigrant experience."&lt;ref name="sunday"/&gt;

The show was unique in that it had no "human" sidekicks such as [[Ed McMahon]] on ''[[The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson]]'' or [[Conan O'Brien]]'s [[Andy Richter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|id=0001992|name=Johnny Carson|accessdate=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://teamcoco.com/ |title=Conan O'Brien Presents: Team Coco @ TeamCoco.com |accessdate=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had a remotely operated robot skeleton named [[Geoff Peterson]] and two silent performers in a pantomime horse costume that were added in 2010. His monologues were conducted within a few feet of the camera versus the long distance that Johnny Carson kept from the camera and audience.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/user/CraigFergusonCBSShow&lt;/ref&gt;

===American citizenship===
During 2007, Ferguson, who at the time held only [[British Nationality Act 1981|British citizenship]], used ''The Late Late Show'' as a forum for seeking [[Honorary citizen of the United States|honorary citizenship]] from every state in the US.
