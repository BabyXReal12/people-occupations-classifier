Hoover learned to fly at [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]]'s [[Nashville International Airport|Berry Field]] while working at a local grocery store to pay for the flight training.&lt;ref name="Forever_Flying_p15_16"&gt;Hoover 1997, pp. 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt; He enlisted in the [[Tennessee Military Department|Tennessee National Guard]] and was sent for pilot training with the [[United States Army|Army]].&lt;ref name="Forever_Flying_p17"&gt;Hoover 1997, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

During World War II, Hoover was sent to [[Casablanca]], where his first major assignment was flight testing the assembled aircraft ready for service.&lt;ref name="Forever_Flying_p37"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Hoover |title=Forever Flying |page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was later assigned to the [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]]-equipped [[52d Operations Group|52d Fighter Group]] in [[Sicily]].&lt;ref name="Forever_Flying_p50"&gt;Hoover 1997, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; On February 9, 1944, on his 59th mission, his malfunctioning Mark V Spitfire was shot down by a pilot of [[Jagdgeschwader 2]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://bbs.hitechcreations.com/smf/index.php?topic=277903.0 |title=Bob Hoover and the Stolen FW-190 to escape from Stalag Luft 1 |work=Aces High Bulletin Board |accessdate=July 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190]] off the coast of Southern France, and he was taken prisoner.&lt;ref name="Forever_Flying_p65_67"&gt;Hoover 1997, pp. 65–67.&lt;/ref&gt; He spent 16 months at the German [[internment|prison camp]] [[Stalag]] Luft 1 in [[Barth, Germany]].&lt;ref name="Forever_Flying_p90"&gt;Hoover 1997, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

After a staged fight covered his escape from the prison camp, Hoover managed to steal an [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190|Fw 190]] from a recovery unit's unguarded field&amp;nbsp;— the one flyable plane being kept there for spare parts&amp;nbsp;— and flew to safety in the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref name="Forever_Flying_p88_90"&gt;Hoover 1997, pp. 88–90.&lt;/ref&gt; He was assigned to flight-test duty at [[Wilbur Wright Field]] after the war. There he impressed and befriended [[Chuck Yeager]].&lt;ref name="Forever_Flying_p93"&gt;Hoover 1997, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; When Yeager was later asked whom he wanted for flight crew for the [[Supersonic speed|supersonic]] [[Bell X-1]] flight, he named Hoover. Hoover became Yeager's backup pilot in the Bell X-1 program and flew chase for Yeager in a [[Lockheed P-80 Shooting Star]] during the [[Mach number|Mach]] 1 flight.&lt;ref name="Forever_Flying_110"&gt;Hoover 1997, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; He also flew chase for the 50th anniversary of the Mach 1 flight in a [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon]].&lt;ref name="athens_post"&gt;[http://www.thepost.ohiou.edu/archives/archives/101597/briefly.html "Hoover Flys Chase for Yeager."] ''Ohio University Post'', October 15, 1997. Retrieved: November 29, 2008.{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoover left the Air Force for civilian jobs in 1948.&lt;ref name="Forever_Flying_p137"&gt;Hoover 1997, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; After a brief time with [[Allison Engine Company]], he worked as a test/demonstration pilot with [[North American Aviation]], in which capacity he went to Korea to teach pilots in the [[Korean War]] how to dive-bomb with the [[North American F-86 Sabre|F-86 Sabre]]. During his six weeks in Korea, Hoover flew many combat bombing missions over enemy territory, but was denied permission to engage in air-to-air combat flights.&lt;ref&gt;Hoover 1997, pp. 187–189.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1950s, Hoover visited many active-duty, reserve, and [[Air National Guard]] units to demonstrate planes' capabilities to their pilots. Hoover flew flight tests on the [[North American FJ-2 Fury|FJ-2 Fury]], F-86 Sabre, and the [[North American F-100 Super Sabre|F-100 Super Sabre]].

In the early 1960s, Hoover began flying the [[North American P-51 Mustang]] at air shows around the country. The Hoover Mustang (N2251D) was purchased by North American Aviation from Dave Lindsay's [[Cavalier Aircraft|Cavalier Aircraft Corp.]] in 1962. A second Mustang (N51RH), later named "Ole Yeller", was purchased by North American Rockwell from Cavalier in 1971 to replace the earlier aircraft, which had been destroyed in a ground accident when an oxygen bottle exploded after being overfilled. Hoover demonstrated the Mustang and later the [[Aero Commander 500 family|Aero Commander]] at hundreds of air shows until his retirement in the 1990s. In 1997, Hoover sold "Ole Yeller" to his good friend John Bagley of Rexburg, Idaho. "Ole Yeller" still flies frequently and is based at the Legacy Flight Museum&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legacyflightmuseum.com/planes.aspx "Library of Planes: Old Yeller."] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090512144432/http://www.legacyflightmuseum.com/planes.aspx |date=May 12, 2009 }} ''Legacyflightmuseum.com''.

Hoover set transcontinental, time-to-climb, and speed records,&lt;ref name="Forever_Flying_p251_253"&gt;Hoover 1997, pp. 251–253.&lt;/ref&gt; and personally knew such great aviators as [[Wright brothers|Orville Wright]], [[Eddie Rickenbacker]], [[Charles Lindbergh]], [[Jimmy Doolittle]], [[Chuck Yeager]], [[Jacqueline Cochran]], [[Neil Armstrong]], and [[Yuri Gagarin]].&lt;ref name="Forever_Flying_p247"&gt;Hoover 1997, p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoover was best known for his civil air show career, which started when he was hired to demonstrate the capabilities of [[Aero Commander]]'s [[Aero Commander 500 family|Shrike]] Commander, a twin piston-engined business aircraft that had developed a staid reputation due to its bulky shape. Hoover showed the strength of the plane as he put the aircraft through rolls, loops, and other maneuvers, which most people would not associate with executive aircraft. As a grand finale, he shut down both engines and executed a loop and an eight-point hesitation slow roll as he headed back to the runway. Upon landing he would touch down on one tire followed gradually by the other. After pulling off the runway, he would start his engines to taxi back to the parking area. On airfields with large enough parking ramps (such as the [[Reno Stead Airport]], where the [[Reno Air Races]] take place), Hoover would sometimes land directly on the ramp and coast all the way back to his parking spot in front of the grandstand without restarting the engines. He was also known for creating the stunt of successfully pouring a cup of tea while performing a [[g-force|1G]] [[barrel roll]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9pvG_ZSnCc |title=Bob Hoover Barrel Roll|publisher=YouTube |date=2014 |accessdate=2017-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His air show aerobatics career ended in 1999, but was marked by issues with the FAA over his medical certification that began when Hoover's medical certificate was revoked by the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name="Forever_Flying_p278_279"&gt;Hoover 1997, pp. 278–279.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Facts"&gt;Jordan, Jon L., MD, JD.

Retrieved: July 19, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly before his revocation, Hoover experienced serious engine problems in a [[North American T-28 Trojan]] off the coast of California. During his return to [[Torrance, California|Torrance]], he was able to keep the engine running intermittently by constantly manipulating the throttle, mixture, and propeller levers. The engine seized at the moment of touchdown. Hoover believed his successful management of this difficult emergency should have convinced the FAA that he hadn't lost any ability.&lt;ref name="Forever_Flying_p280"&gt;Hoover 1997, p. 280.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Hoover was granted a pilot's license, and medical certificate by Australia's aviation authorities.&lt;ref name="Forever_Flying_p281_282"&gt;Hoover 1997, pp. 281–282.&lt;/ref&gt; Hoover's medical certificate was restored shortly afterward and he returned to the American air show circuit for several years before retiring in 1999. At 77 years old Hoover still felt capable of performing and passed a rigorous FAA physical post retirement, but he was unable to obtain insurance for air shows. Although he had had free insurance for several years as part of air show sponsorship deals, he was forced in 1999 to pay for it out of his own pocket and could not get coverage under $2 million. His final air show was on November 13, 1999 at Luke Air Force base. His last flight in his famous Shrike Commander was on October 10, 2003 from Lakeland, Florida to the Smithsonian Air and Space museum in Washington D.C. with long time friend Steve Clegg.

Following Hoover's retirement, his [[Shrike Commander]] was placed on display at the [[National Air and Space Museum]], [[Udvar-Hazy Center]], in [[Dulles, Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://airandspace.si.edu/collections/artifact.cfm?id=A20000796000 "North American Rockwell Shrike Commander 500S, Robert A.

==Death==
Hoover died on October 25, 2016 near his home in [[Los Angeles]] at the age of 94.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/26/us/bob-hoover-dead.html?_r=0 |title=Bob Hoover, Aviator Whose Aerobatic Stunts Are Legend, Dies at 94 |work=[[The New York Times]] |last=Mellow |first=Craig H. |date=October 25, 2016 |accessdate=July 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A memorial service and celebration of life honoring Bob Hoover was held on November 18, 2016, hosted by aerobatic legend [[Sean D. Tucker]] and world renowned pilot [[Clay Lacy]] at the [[Van Nuys Airport]]. Nearly 1,500 family and friends attended the memorial, with speakers such as Hollywood icon [[Harrison Ford]], film producer [[David Ellison]], Jonna Doolittle (granddaughter of [[Jimmy Doolittle]]) and many others. The event culminated with the [[United States Air Force]] [[Honor guard|Honor Guard]] presenting the American Flag to the family - which coincided with a three element fly-over. The lead element featured a [[Rockwell Sabreliner]] similar to that which Hoover flew during airshows, along with two [[F-16 Falcon|F-16s]] from the [[USAF Thunderbirds]] and a [[CT-114]] from the [[Canadian Forces Snowbirds]].

==Hoover Nozzle and Hoover Ring==
The "Hoover Nozzle", used on jet fuel pumps, is designed with a flattened bell shape. It cannot be inserted in the filler neck of a plane with the "Hoover Ring" installed, thus preventing the tank from accidentally being filled with jet fuel.

This system was given this name following an accident in which Hoover was seriously injured, when both engines on his Shrike Commander failed during takeoff. Investigators found that the plane had just been fueled by line personnel who mistook the piston-engine Shrike for a similar [[turboprop]] model, filling the tanks with [[jet fuel]] instead of [[avgas]] (aviation gasoline).&lt;ref name="Forever_Flying_p275_277"&gt;Hoover 1997, pp. 275–277.&lt;/ref&gt; There was enough avgas in the fuel system to taxi to the runway and take off, but then the jet fuel was drawn into the engines, causing them to stop.

Once Hoover recovered, he widely promoted&lt;ref&gt;[http://avstop.com/news_sept_2010/six_aviation_legends_to_be_recognized_as_master_pilots.htm "Six aviation legends to be recognized as 'Master Pilots'."] ''Aviation Online Magazine'', September 19, 2010. Retrieved: June 24, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; the use of the new type of nozzle with the support and funding of the [[National Air Transportation Association]], [[General Aviation Manufacturers Association]], and various other aviation groups (the nozzle is now required by Federal regulation on jet fuel pumps).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faa.gov/news/safety_briefing/2005/media/julaug2005.pdf   "The Causes and Remedies of Aviation Misfueling."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924050324/http://www.faa.gov/news/safety_briefing/2005/media/julaug2005.pdf |date=2015-09-24 }} ''Federal Aviation Administration'', July–August 2005, p. 20.
