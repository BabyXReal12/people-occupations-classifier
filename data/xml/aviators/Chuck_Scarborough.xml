'''Charles Bishop Scarborough III''' (born November 4, 1943) is an American television journalist and author. Since 1974, he has been the lead news anchor at [[WNBC]], the [[New York City]] [[flagship station]] of the [[NBC|NBC Television Network]], and has also appeared on [[NBC News]]. He currently anchors at 6pm on WNBC.&lt;ref name="NBCBIO"&gt;[http://www.nbcnewyork.com/station/about-us/Chuck_Scarborough.html "Bio: Chuck Scarborough"], NBC News official site&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
A native of [[Pittsburgh]] and a graduate of the [[University of Southern Mississippi]], Scarborough served in the [[United States Air Force]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aopa.org/news-and-media/all-news/2011/september/pilot/pilots&lt;/ref&gt; and currently has a commercial [[aviator|pilot]] certificate. His career in television began in [[Mississippi]] as a reporter at [[WLOX-TV]] in [[Biloxi, Mississippi|Biloxi]] and later [[WDAM-TV]] in [[Laurel, Mississippi|Laurel]], before moving to [[WAGA-TV]] in [[Atlanta]].

Scarborough's first major market anchoring job came in 1972, at [[WNAC-TV (defunct)|WNAC-TV]] in [[Boston]]. He was originally hired as part of a two-man anchor team with respected New England journalist Lee Nelson, but was soon made the solo anchor of the station's news broadcasts. In addition to his anchor work, he was called on to host a weekly program called ''Mass Reaction'', in which the public was invited to the studio to question news broadcasters and newsmakers.

In his final broadcast on WNAC-TV, Scarborough ended the newscast with a commentary in which he identified the issue of race as the most important challenge facing Boston. A scant few months later, Boston erupted into racial unrest as the result of a federal court order to end its policy of de facto racial segregation in the public schools. While WNAC had been the perennial trailer among Boston's three VHF television news broadcasts, with Scarborough as anchor the station managed to best its rivals in the 6pm newscast ratings.

Scarborough joined [[NBC News]] in March 1974 as sole anchor of [[WNBC-TV]]'s then-new 5:00 PM newscast, ''NewsCenter 4'' (later renamed ''[[News 4 New York]]'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC-IDX/74-OCR/1974-03-18-BC-0085.pdf "New anchor at WNBC-TV."

''Broadcasting'', May 6, 1974, pg. 36. [http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC-IDX/74-OCR/1974-05-06-BC-0036.pdf]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, he became the station's lead anchor at 6pm and 11pm. In 2003, he became the unofficial "dean" of New York-area television news anchors when [[WABC-TV]] anchor [[Bill Beutel]] retired after 37 years. He surpassed Beutel as New York's most tenured English-language news anchor in 2011. Five years later, Scarborough succeeded [[Rafael Pineda (television journalist)|Rafael Pineda]] of Spanish-language [[WXTV]] as the longest-serving anchor in New York television history. For much of his first 20 years with NBC, he occasionally appeared on the network as a correspondent and often anchored the network's prime-time news updates.

At WNBC, he has worked alongside [[Marv Albert]], [[Len Berman]], [[Jack Cafferty]], [[Frank Field (meteorologist)|Dr. Frank Field]], [[John Hambrick]], [[Pat Harper]], [[Pia Lindstrom]], [[Sue Simmons]], [[Michele Marsh (reporter)|Michele Marsh]], [[Al Roker]], and [[Tom Snyder]], among others.

Scarborough was the host of the [[Television syndication|syndicated]] programs ''Images â€“ A Year in Review'' and ''Memories...Then and Now'' in the late 1980s-early 1990s, and also co-anchored the NBC network documentary series ''Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow'' with [[Maria Shriver]] and [[Mary Alice Williams]].

The 11:00 pm broadcast on July 14, 2017, marked Scarborough's last in that time slot after 42 years, as he cut back on his schedule to working only the 6pm. Taking his place at 11 will be Stefan Holt, the son of ''[[NBC Nightly News]]'' anchor [[Lester Holt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=WNBC anchor Chuck Scarborough leaving late-night job after 42 years for earlier shift|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/wnbc-anchor-chuck-scarborough-drops-late-night-gig-article-1.3289710|first=Don|last=Kaplan|website=nydailynews.com|publisher=[[New York Daily News]]|date=June 30, 2017|accessdate=July 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
