'''Richard Hugh McCaw''' {{post-nominals|country=NZL|ONZ}} (born 31 December 1980) is a retired New Zealand [[rugby union]] player. He [[captain (sports)|captained]] the [[New Zealand national rugby union team|national team]], the All Blacks, in 110 out of his 148 test matches, and won two [[Rugby World Cup]]s. He is the [[List of rugby union Test caps leaders|most capped test rugby player]] of all time, and has won the [[World Rugby Player of the Year|World Rugby player of the year]] award a joint record three times.

McCaw predominantly played in the [[Flanker (rugby union)|openside flanker]] position for the New Zealand, [[Crusaders (rugby)|Crusaders]] and [[Canterbury Rugby Football Union|Canterbury]] teams, but also played as a blindside flanker and [[Rugby union positions#Number Eight|no. 8]]. During McCaw's career, Canterbury won the NPC (later ITM Cup) five times, and the Crusaders won four [[Super Rugby]] titles. As well as two world cups, the All Blacks won seven [[Tri Nations (rugby union)|Tri-Nations]] titles, completed three successful [[Grand Slam (rugby union)|Grand Slam tours]] and won the [[Bledisloe Cup]] eight times.

He made his debut in 2001 for the Crusaders, and was selected for the All Blacks' 2001 end-of-year tour, despite having played only eight minutes of Super 12 rugby. His debut for New Zealand was against [[Ireland national rugby union team|Ireland]], where he was awarded man-of-the-match. McCaw became a regular selection for New Zealand, only missing a few games due to recurring [[concussion]]s. In 2004 he was appointed captain of the All Blacks, whom he led at the [[2007 Rugby World Cup|2007 World Cup]]. After their elimination in the quarter-finals, his captaincy came under criticism, but he was retained and eventually led the team to consecutive world cup titles in [[2011 Rugby World Cup|2011]] and [[2015 Rugby World Cup|2015]], becoming one of only [[List of dual Rugby Union World Cup winners|twenty players]] who have won two rugby union world cups.

McCaw was the first All Black to reach 100 caps, and the first rugby union player to win 100 tests. He is the [[List of rugby union Test caps leaders|most-capped player in rugby union history]] with 148 caps, having overtaken [[Brian O'Driscoll]]'s record in 2015. McCaw has also equaled the record for most appearances at the Rugby World Cup with [[Jason Leonard]].

==Early years==

McCaw's great-great-grandfather immigrated to New Zealand from the [[Scottish Borders]] in 1893,&lt;ref name="Kimmage 2006"&gt;{{cite news |title=The Big Interview: Richie McCaw |first=Paul |last=Kimmage |date=5 November 2006 |newspaper=Times |location=UK |url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/sport/article167129.ece |accessdate=7 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and settled in the [[Hakataramea]] Valley, South Canterbury. McCaw's father took over the family farm and his mother was a teacher at [[Kurow]].&lt;ref name="Gray2006"&gt;{{cite news |title=The rise and rise of Richie McCaw |author=Wynne Gray |date=12 May 2006 |newspaper=The New Zealand Herald |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&amp;objectid=10381356}}&lt;/ref&gt; On New Year's Eve 1980, Richard Hugh McCaw was born in the nearby town of [[Oamaru]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/photograph/40040/richie-mccaw-holds-the-webb-ellis-trophy|title=Rugby union - Rugby World Cup|last=Palenski|first=Ron|last2=|first2=New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage Te Manatu|date=19 Sep 2016|website=Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand|language=en|access-date=2017-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up on his parents' farm along with his sister Joanna. McCaw started flying gliders with his grandfather J H 'Jim' McCaw,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=All Blacks captain Richie McCaw has special reason to recognise Armistice Day|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/international/newzealand/3417548/All-Blacks-captain-Richie-McCaw-has-special-reason-to-recognise-Armistice-Day-Rugby-Union.html|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=10 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Hawker Tempest|Tempest]] pilot during [[World War II]] credited with shooting down 20 V1 missiles, when he was nine years old.&lt;ref name="Kimmage 2006" /&gt; He played rugby for the local Kurow rugby club as a youngster,&lt;ref name="Gray2006" /&gt; but it was not until 1994, when he [[Boarding school|boarded]] at [[Otago Boys' High School]] in [[Dunedin]], that he started to take the game seriously.&lt;ref name="Kimmage 2006" /&gt;

In his last year at Otago Boys High, McCaw was [[head boy]], ''proxime accessit'' (runner up) to the [[dux]] and played in the school's starting XV.&lt;ref name="Gray2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ODT 2006"&gt;{{cite news |title=McCaw fulfils destiny as All Black captain |newspaper=Otago Daily Times |date=13 May 2006 |url=http://richie-mccaw.blogspot.com/2007/06/mccaw-fulfils-destiny-as-all-black.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; McCaw came to the attention of national selectors during a 5-all draw with [[Rotorua Boys' High School]] in the 1998 New Zealand secondary schools rugby final in [[Christchurch]].&lt;ref name="Kimmage 2006" /&gt; However, he failed to make the [[New Zealand national schoolboy rugby union team|New Zealand Secondary Schools Team]], losing out to [[Sam Harding (rugby union)|Sam Harding]], [[Angus Macdonald (rugby union)|Angus McDonald]] and [[Hale T-Pole]].&lt;ref name="ODT 2006" /&gt; With Sam Harding moving south to study at the [[University of Otago]], McCaw headed to Christchurch's [[Lincoln University, New Zealand|Lincoln University]] to study [[agricultural science]] and pursue his rugby interests.&lt;ref name="Gray2006" /&gt; He achieved all but two papers for his Bachelor of Agricultural Science degree before deciding to pursue his rugby career instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tvnz.co.nz/national-news/richie-mccaw-honorary-doctorate-pretty-awesome-4843480 |title=Richie McCaw: Honorary doctorate 'pretty awesome' |date=20 April 2012 |publisher=TVOne News |accessdate=28 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received an honorary doctorate in recognition of his sporting achievements in April 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Ashleigh |last=Stewart |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/rugby/news/6781944/All-Blacks-captain-McCaw-receives-doctorate |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130223065626/http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/rugby/news/6781944/All-Blacks-captain-McCaw-receives-doctorate |dead-url=yes |archive-date=23 February 2013 |title=All Blacks captain McCaw receives doctorate |date=20 April 2012 |work=Rugby Heaven |accessdate=28 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, McCaw was selected in the [[New Zealand national under-19 rugby union team|New Zealand under-19]] squad (coached by [[Mark Shaw (rugby union)|Mark Shaw]]), which won the world championship in Wales. During that series, McCaw realised his All Blacks dream could be attainable.&lt;ref name="Kimmage 2006" /&gt; The following year he was selected in the [[New Zealand national under-21 rugby union team|New Zealand under-21]] squad and debuted for [[Canterbury Rugby Football Union|Canterbury]] in the [[National Provincial Championship]] (NPC) against [[North Harbour Rugby Union|North Harbour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Richie McCaw: Player Profile |publisher=Canterbury Rugby Football Union |url=http://www.canterburyrugby.co.nz/profile/richie-mccaw/78/player-details.aspx |accessdate=30 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100526042617/http://www.canterburyrugby.co.nz/profile/richie-mccaw/78/player-details.aspx |archivedate=26 May 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 March 2001, he made his [[Super Rugby]] debut with the [[Crusaders (rugby)|Crusaders]], playing a few minutes in a losing effort against the [[Hurricanes (Super rugby franchise)|Hurricanes]].&lt;ref name="Gray2006" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Player Profiles: Richie McCaw |publisher=Crusaders |url=http://www.crusaders.co.nz/profile/richie-mccaw/1/player-details.aspx |accessdate=30 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100526172801/http://www.crusaders.co.nz/profile/richie-mccaw/1/player-details.aspx |archivedate=26 May 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; That year he only played twice for the Crusaders, both times as a substitute, for a total of just eight minutes playing time.&lt;ref name="Gray17-7-09"&gt;{{cite news |title=All Blacks: Ruling game from sun-up to breakdown |author=Wynne Gray |date=17 July 2009 |newspaper=The New Zealand Herald |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&amp;objectid=10584933}}&lt;/ref&gt; He did however play a full season with NPC champions Canterbury and captained the New Zealand Under 21s.&lt;ref name="Unfazed 2001"&gt;{{cite news |title=McCaw unfazed by Kronfeld criticism |newspaper=The New Zealand Herald |date=9 November 2001 |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&amp;objectid=227478}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Colts players tipped for greater things |newspaper=The New Zealand Herald |date=2 July 2001 |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&amp;objectid=197846}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Playing career==

===International debut===
Although the then 20-year-old McCaw had only played seventeen matches for Canterbury, [[John Mitchell (rugby union)|John Mitchell]], the new All Black coach, selected him for the 2001 end of year tour to Ireland, Scotland and Argentina. This led [[Josh Kronfeld]], a former All Black [[Flanker (rugby union)|openside flanker]], to criticise the selection: "You might as well just give All Black jerseys to everybody. The fact they picked guys off one NPC season is bloody incredible".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kronfeld critical of the new No 7s |date=6 November 2001 |newspaper=The New Zealand Herald |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&amp;objectid=226794}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McCaw's debut international test was against [[Ireland national rugby union team|Ireland]] at [[Lansdowne Road]] on 17 November 2001. His first touch of the game resulted in a [[Knock-on (rugby union)|knock-on]] when he was hit in a [[Tackle (football move)|tackle]] and New Zealand were trailing the Irish 16–7 at half-time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Lansdowne Road impresses McCaw |date=20 November 2010 |first=Julian |last=Guyer |newspaper=Times Live |location=South Africa |url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/sport/rugby/article773707.ece/Lansdowne-Road-impresses-McCaw}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second half the All Blacks recovered to win 40–29 and McCaw was named [[man of the match]], receiving a standing ovation at the post-match function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Interview: Richie McCaw |first=Marc |last=Hinto |newspaper=The Guardian |date=20 June 2005 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2005/jun/20/lions2005.rugbyunion1 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; A turning point came in the second half when McCaw was able to steal the ball from Ireland, which led to a try to [[Winger (sports)|left wing]] [[Jonah Lomu]].&lt;ref name="impact 2001"&gt;{{cite news |title=Bruised star makes big impact |date=19 November 2001 |newspaper=The New Zealand Herald |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&amp;objectid=228959}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the match McCaw recalled the experience: "it was a hell of a stadium to play at, a real rugby stadium, a big crowd – something I'll always remember, very special."&lt;ref name="impact 2001" /&gt;

McCaw played all three tests on the tour, with the All Blacks beating [[Scottish national rugby union team|Scotland]] 37–6&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=All Blacks have to find some answers |date=23 June 2002 |newspaper=The New Zealand Herald |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&amp;objectid=2048119}}&lt;/ref&gt; and winning 24–20 against [[Argentina national rugby union team|Argentina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=All Blacks almost humbled by Pumas |date=3 December 2001 |first=Wynne |last=Gray |newspaper=The New Zealand Herald |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&amp;objectid=231276}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of season rugby awards, McCaw was selected as both the [[New Zealand Rugby Football Union]] Under-21 and [[Air New Zealand]] NPC Division One Player of the Year.&lt;ref name="Blackadder2001"&gt;{{cite news |title=Blackadder is named our top rugby personality |date=6 December 2001 |newspaper=The New Zealand Herald |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&amp;objectid=231792}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2002–03===
In the lead-up to the [[2003 Rugby World Cup|2003 World Cup]] McCaw was a regular player for Canterbury, the Crusaders and the All Blacks. In 2002 and 2003 the Crusaders competed in the Super Rugby final, beating the [[Brumbies]] in 2002&lt;ref name="Crusaders 2002"&gt;{{cite news |title=Crusaders all-conquering champions of Super 12 |first=Wynne |last=Gray |date=25 May 2002 |newspaper=The New Zealand Herald |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&amp;objectid=2043246}}&lt;/ref&gt; and losing to the [[Blues (Super Rugby)|Blues]] in 2003.&lt;ref name="Blues 2003"&gt;{{cite news |title=Blues are Super 12 champs |date=24 May 2003 |newspaper=The New Zealand Herald |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&amp;objectid=3503806}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Canterbury provincial rugby team lost the semi final to the eventual winners [[Auckland Rugby Football Union|Auckland]] in 2002.&lt;ref name="Auckland2002"&gt;{{cite news |title=Auckland one step from glory |first=Wynne |last=Gray |date=19 October 2002 |newspaper=The New Zealand Herald |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&amp;objectid=3000020}}&lt;/ref&gt; McCaw and the other All Blacks were "rested" during the 2003 national provincial championship.&lt;ref name="Spectators2003"&gt;{{cite news |title=Canterbury spectators as NPC climax nears |date=12 October 2003 |newspaper=The New Zealand Herald |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&amp;objectid=3528397}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 McCaw played for the All Blacks against the touring Ireland team (15–6 and 40–8 victories) and in the [[The Rugby Championship|Tri&amp;nbsp;Nations]] against [[Australia national rugby union team|Australia]] and [[South Africa national rugby union team|South Africa]]. Of the six 2002 test matches McCaw played in, five were won by New Zealand with the only loss to Australia.&lt;ref name="Kimmage 2006" /&gt; The 14–16 loss occurred in New Zealand's third Tri&amp;nbsp;Nations match and ensured the [[Bledisloe Cup]] stayed with Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald  |title=Backs hog headlines but the pigs save our bacon |first=Mark |last=Ella |date=9 August 2002 |url=http://newsstore.smh.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?page=1&amp;sy=smh&amp;kw=bledisloe+and+2002+and+burke&amp;pb=all_ffx&amp;dt=selectRange&amp;dr=10years&amp;so=relevance&amp;sf=text&amp;sf=headline&amp;rc=10&amp;rm=200&amp;sp=nrm&amp;clsPage=1&amp;docID=SMH020809NCKHA0A78QU}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the All Blacks match against South Africa in [[Kings Park Stadium|Durban]] a pitch invader attacked Irish [[Rugby union match officials|referee]] [[David McHugh]] as a [[Scrum (rugby)|scrum]] was being set, dislocating his shoulder in the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Crash tackled ref to sue Bok 'fan' |date=12 August 2002 |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald |url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/08/12/1028158064422.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; McCaw and [[A.J. Venter]] wrestled the assailant off the referee and, according to McHugh, if they had not got involved his shoulder would have been broken.&lt;ref name="Gray2006" /&gt; McCaw was rested, along with 20 other members of the Tri&amp;nbsp;Nations squad, from the 2002 end-of-year tour to Europe.&lt;ref name="2002 squad"&gt;{{cite news |title=Randell back as captain of new-look All Blacks |date=28 October 2002 |newspaper=The New Zealand Herald |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&amp;objectid=3001391}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 McCaw was voted as Newcomer of the Year by the International Rugby Players Association.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;[http://www.allblacks.com/index.cfm?layout=PlayerProfile&amp;playerID=1121 "player profiles – Richie McCaw"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511230921/http://www.allblacks.com/index.cfm?layout=PlayerProfile&amp;playerID=1121 |date=11 May 2013 }} allblacks.com&lt;/ref&gt; This award is voted on by all international players, with players not allowed to vote for members of their own team.

After another successful campaign with the Crusaders in 2003 (reaching the Super 12 finals), McCaw was again selected as first choice openside flanker for the All Blacks. In June he was involved in a narrow 13–15 defeat at home to England, was a non-playing reserve in a 55–3 victory against Wales and played in a 31–23 win over France.&lt;ref name="measure 2003"&gt;{{cite news |title=World Cup will measure success of Mitchell's journey |date=30 September 2003 |newspaper=The New Zealand Herald |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&amp;objectid=3526271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McCaw was selected as first choice openside flanker and made vice captain. In the first test against England he was escorted off the field after suffering [[concussion]] following a clash of heads with fellow All Black [[Xavier Rush]].

Another [[paraplegic]] in the ward told him he had broken his neck swimming on holiday in Fiji, convincing McCaw that it could happen anywhere, and you may as well "do what you enjoy".&lt;ref name="Kimmage 2006" /&gt; A month later, in May 2005, McCaw returned to training with the Crusaders and led them in their semi-final and final victories.&lt;ref name="farewell"&gt;{{cite news |title=Crusaders provide fitting farewell |author=Wynne Gray |date=30 May 2005 |newspaper=The New Zealand Herald |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&amp;objectid=10128164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McCaw returned to international rugby in 2005, playing in the 91–0 victory over [[Fiji national rugby union team|Fiji]] before the [[British and Irish Lions]] arrived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=All Blacks scorch hapless Fiji |date=10 June 2005 |newspaper=The New Zealand Herald |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&amp;objectid=10330063}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then played the first two test against the Lions, including a record 48–18 victory in Wellington.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=All Blacks secure record win over Lions |author=Paul Smith |date=2 July 2005 |newspaper=The New Zealand Herald |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&amp;objectid=10333873}}&lt;/ref&gt; The All Blacks defeated the touring Lions 3–0 in the series.

Because 2007 was a World Cup year, All Black management decided that a select group of 22 players, including McCaw, would undergo "reconditioning" by not playing in the first seven rounds of the Super 14.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Rugby: Deans confronts his toughest challenge |first=Dylan |last=Cleaver |date=28 January 2007 |newspaper=The New Zealand Herald |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&amp;objectid=10421220}}&lt;/ref&gt; McCaw returned to the Crusaders in the eighth round and helped them reach the semi-finals.&lt;ref name="Semis 2007"&gt;{{cite news |title=Rugby: Deans not going for Wallabies job |date=18 May 2007 |newspaper=The New Zealand Herald |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&amp;objectid=10440410}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Zealand then beat a below-strength&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Rugby: More a training run than a test |date=16 June 2007 |first=Wynne |last=Gray |newspaper=The New Zealand Herald |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&amp;objectid=10446049}}&lt;/ref&gt; France team in two tests and won a one-off test against Canada.

====2007 World Cup====
The [[2007 Rugby World Cup|2007 World Cup]] was held in France, Scotland and Wales. The All Blacks were in a pool that included Italy, [[Portugal national rugby union team|Portugal]], Scotland and [[Romania national rugby union team|Romania]]. The All Blacks comfortably made it through the pool play with scores of 76–14, 108–13, 40–0 and 85–8 respectively. McCaw made just three appearances (two starts and one as a reserve) due to Henry's rotation policy. In the quarter-finals the All Blacks lost to France 18–20, resulting in New Zealand's earliest exit from a World Cup. With semi-final exits after being among the favourites at the 1991, 1999 and 2003 World Cups, they were once again accused of "choking on the world's biggest stage".&lt;ref name="emotional"&gt;{{cite news |title=Rugby: McCaw struggles to cope with World Cup exit |newspaper=The New Zealand Herald |date=7 October 2007 |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&amp;objectid=10468441 |first=Julian |last=Guyer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An emotional McCaw could not hide his disappointment at the after-match press conference: "If I knew the answers we would have sorted it out. We will be thinking about it for a long time".&lt;ref name="emotional" /&gt; McCaw denied New Zealand's easy run into the quarter-finals played a part in the loss "A lot of the guys have been through this before, they've played big test matches."&lt;ref name="emotional" /&gt; Graham Henry's policy of using squad rotation and resting key players during the Super 14 was  criticised.&lt;ref name="Slade"&gt;{{cite news |title=Book blames Henry for loss |first=Maria |last=Slade |date=21 October 2007 |newspaper=The New Zealand Herald |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&amp;objectid=10471137}}&lt;/ref&gt; McCaw also came under attack. He was accused of not inspiring his team, lacking the ability to change policy when plan A was not working&lt;ref name="Slade" /&gt; and not providing enough leadership on the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=All Black takers rather than givers |first=John |last=Hart |date=8 December 2007 |newspaper=The New Zealand Herald |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&amp;objectid=10480988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 a fourth [[Bledisloe Cup|Bledisloe match]] was played in Hong Kong with the intention of expanding the game of rugby&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hong Kong to host Bledisloe Cup test |date=3 March 2008 |newspaper=The New Zealand Herald |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&amp;objectid=10495889}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in a close 19–14 game McCaw scored the match winning try. The Grand Slam tour to the United Kingdom and Ireland resulted in victories over Scotland (32–6), Ireland (22–3), Wales (29–9) and England (32–6).&lt;ref name="review 2008" /&gt;  During 2008 McCaw won every test he captained and a total of 26 out of 28 games he played in at all levels. The All Blacks won 13 of a record 15 tests, retained the Bledisloe Cup and Tri&amp;nbsp;Nations Trophy, completed the Grand Slam and reclaimed the world No. 1 ranking from South Africa.&lt;ref name="review 2008" /&gt;

===2009–10===
The Crusaders, under new coach [[Todd Blackadder]], had a slow start to the 2009 season, losing four of their first five games. They recovered to finish fourth on the table, losing the semi-final at [[Loftus Versfeld]] to the Bulls.&lt;ref name="Steyn 2009"&gt;{{cite news |title=Rugby: Steyn boots Crusaders out of Super 14 |date=24 May 2009 |newspaper=The New Zealand Herald |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&amp;objectid=10574257}}&lt;/ref&gt; McCaw injured his knee and missed the start of the international season,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Rugby: Injury puts McCaw out of All Black tests |date=29 May 2009 |newspaper=The New Zealand Herald |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&amp;objectid=10575229}}&lt;/ref&gt; returning for the Tri&amp;nbsp;Nations tournament.

A fourth Bledisloe Test against Australia was played in Japan before New Zealand toured Europe. Although New Zealand won every match on tour, an earlier loss to France and three defeats by the South Africans were the most suffered by the All Blacks in a season since McCaw joined the team in 2001.&lt;ref name="tour 2009" /&gt; Despite the team's relatively poor season, McCaw was named the IRB International Player of the Year for a second time.&lt;ref name="tour 2009" /&gt;

During preseason training in January 2011 McCaw injured his foot, subsequent x-rays revealed that he had received a stress fracture in the fifth metatarsal of his right foot.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theroar.com.au/2011/02/09/richie-mccaw-sidelined-by-stress-fracture/ "Richie McCaw sidelined by stress fracture"], The Roar&lt;/ref&gt; It was determined his best chance of recovery was to undergo an operation where a pin was inserted.

In order to rest his injury, he was forced to skip the more physical aspects of training and miss the All Blacks' final pool match against Canada. Prior to the Quarter-final against Argentina McCaw decided against having another x-ray.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://www.therugbysite.com/blog_posts/128-how-i-beat-the-pain-to-play-in-the-world-cup-final-by-richie-mccaw "How I beat the pain to play in the World Cup final by Richie McCaw"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029204354/http://www.therugbysite.com/blog_posts/128-how-i-beat-the-pain-to-play-in-the-world-cup-final-by-richie-mccaw |date=29 October 2013 }}.

This was the lowest score in a final in World Cup history. After the final, the All Black coach [[Graham Henry]] stated "He can hardly walk and how he played today I just don't know,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/oct/23/rugby-world-cup-final-henry-mccaw |location=London |work=The Guardian |first=Paul |last=Rees |title=Rugby World Cup final: New Zealand's Graham Henry praises Richie McCaw |date=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he acknowledged the All Blacks probably would not have won without him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hepburn |first=Steve |url=http://www.odt.co.nz/sport/rugby/240793/rugby-end-nigh |title=Rugby: Is the end nigh? |work=Otago Daily Times |date=29 December 2012 |accessdate=8 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the World Cup x-rays showed that the screw in his foot, necessary to stop the deterioration of the original injury had caused a second fracture.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; The fracture again, required a further operation.

After the Rugby World Cup McCaw was selected in the RWC Dream Team. This team was determined by public vote, with over 160,000 votes cast.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rugbyworldcup.com/home/news/newsid=2060457.html Official RWC 2015 Site – RWC 2011 Facebook Dream Team&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022084102/http://www.rugbyworldcup.com/home/news/newsid%3D2060457.html |date=22 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, for the second successive year McCaw was named the New Zealand sportsperson of the year at the Halberg Awards.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/halberg-awards/news/article.cfm?c_id=1500885&amp;objectid=10784552 |work=The New Zealand Herald |title=Halberg sweep caps All Blacks' great year – Halberg Awards – NZ Herald News |date=10 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2012–2015===
Under new coach Steve Hansen, the All Blacks won 12 tests, drew one and only lost one test in 2012, as well as winning the new Rugby Championship with a 100% winning record. During this time McCaw overtook George Gregan for most times on the winning side with 94. He also recorded his 100th win against South Africa in Dunedin. McCaw was a nominee for the IRB Player of the Year award but lost out to teammate Dan Carter.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

In the first half of 2013, in order to rest his body and improve his chances of playing in the [[2015 Rugby World Cup]] McCaw enforced the sabbatical clause in his [[NZRFU]] contract. As a result, he only played the latter rounds of [[2013 Super Rugby season|Super Rugby]], and missed the [[2013 France rugby union tour of New Zealand|2013 French Test Series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.3news.co.nz/Super-Rugby-2013-playoff-previews-Crusaders-V-Reds-Brumbies-V-Cheetahs/tabid/415/articleID/305590/Default.aspx |title=Super Rugby 2013 playoff previews, Crusaders V Reds, Brumbies V Cheetahs – Story – 3 Sport|publisher=3 News|accessdate=8 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later returned to captain the All Blacks as they successfully defended the Rugby Championship. During this campaign, McCaw equalled (with [[Brian O'Driscoll]] of Ireland and [[John Smit]] of South Africa) the record as captaining the most test matches (83). McCaw subsequently overtook this record when playing in Japan on 2 November 2013.&lt;ref name="espnscrum1"&gt;[http://stats.espnscrum.com/scrum/rugby/records/player/most_matches_captain.html?id=1;type=class "Test matches – Most matches as a captain"], ESPN Scrum; accessed 21 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the All Blacks victory over the Springboks in [[Ellis Park Stadium|Ellis Park]], McCaw has played and won at every major Rugby Test stadium.&lt;ref name="autogenerated5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://keo.co.za/index-old.php/2013/09/mighty-mccaw-wants-a-taste-of-ellis-park|title=All Blacks captain Richie McCaw wants to experience Ellis Park – The Rugby Championship|publisher=Keo.co.za|date=29 September 2013|accessdate=8 May 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140508063657/http://keo.co.za/index-old.php/2013/09/mighty-mccaw-wants-a-taste-of-ellis-park/|archivedate=8 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Along with Kieran Read, McCaw led the All Blacks to a perfect season in 2013, winning 14 out of 14.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planetrugby.com/story/0,25883,3551_9040200,00.html|title=Perfect year for All Blacks|publisher=Planet Rugby|date=24 November 2013|accessdate=8 May 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140508062824/http://www.planetrugby.com/story/0,25883,3551_9040200,00.html|archivedate=8 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Playing style==
McCaw predominately played at openside flanker, although he has played in the other "loose forward" positions of blindside flanker and number eight for the Crusaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=It is different at the ruck, but McCaw will stay put|first=James|last=Mortimer|date=17 April 2010|accessdate=14 March 2013|publisher=All Blacks|url=http://www.allblacks.com/news/12721/It-is-different-at-the-ruck-but-McCaw-will-stay-put}}&lt;/ref&gt; The openside flanker binds  to the side of the scrum farthest from the [[touch-line]] and is usually one of the first players to reach a [[breakdown (rugby union)|breakdown]]. In 2008, McCaw told the IRB:&lt;blockquote&gt;"My main role as a flanker is, defensively, to tie in with the back line to ensure that the defence works well. On attack I think my primary role at first phase is to look after our ball. You attack the back line and I'm usually the first person there to make sure we secure that ball. Thirdly I put pressure on [[breakdown (rugby union)|break downs]] and make sure I disturb their ball and try to [[Turnover (rugby union)|turn their ball over]]."&lt;ref name="master class"&gt;{{cite web|title=Back &amp; McCaw: Open side master class|date=21 November 2008|work=Total Rugby Radio|publisher=International Rugby Board|url=http://www.irb.com/home/totalrugbyradio/newsid=2027651.html|accessdate=21 April 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140422232042/http://www.irb.com/home/totalrugbyradio/newsid%3D2027651.html|archivedate=22 April 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Personal life==
In January 2013 it was reported that he had been [[Dating|seeing]] hockey player [[Gemma Flynn]] for the past six months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/news/article.cfm?c_id=6&amp;objectid=10860837 |title=Captain Richie dating young Black Sticks star |date=23 January 2013 |work=The New Zealand Herald |accessdate=20 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; McCaw announced his engagement to Flynn in January 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Former All Black captain Richie McCaw engaged to Gemma Flynn&lt;!-- title of print version, published on 13 January, was "Richie McCaw engaged" --&gt; |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/rugby/75836350/richie-mccaw-engaged-to-gemma-flynn | work=[[The Press]] | page=A2 |publisher= Fairfax New Zealand |date= 12 January 2015 |accessdate= 12 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They married on 14 January 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=van Beynen |first1=Martin |title=Richie McCaw's and Gemma Flynn's big day arrives |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/rugby/88415527/richie-mccaws-and-gemma-flynns-big-day-arrives |accessdate=14 January 2017 |work=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |date=14 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His other sporting passion is flying and he was made an honorary [[Squadron Leader]] in the [[Royal New Zealand Air Force]] in 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New high-flying role for McCaw |date=12 March 2010 |newspaper=TVNZ |url=http://tvnz.co.nz/rugby-news/new-high-flying-role-mccaw-3412955 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614103906/http://tvnz.co.nz/rugby-news/new-high-flying-role-mccaw-3412955 |archivedate=14 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was promoted to honorary [[Wing commander (rank)|Wing Commander]] in September 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Richie McCaw promoted to Wing Commander in Royal New Zealand Air Force |date=29 September 2016 |newspaper=stuff.co.nz|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/rugby/84811623/Richie-McCaw-promoted-to-Wing-Commander-in-Royal-New-Zealand-Air-Force}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McCaw was taught to fly gliders by his grandfather J H 'Jim' McCaw who flew more than 300 missions in the Second World War.&lt;ref name="times"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Times |date=28 November 2009 |title=Richie McCaw combines substance with style |first=Mark |last=Souster |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/rugby_union/article5248244.ece |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 he convinced the head of the [[Discovery network]] in Australia and New Zealand to do a show about gliding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Richie McCaw's other passion – gliding |first=Scott |last=Kara |date=25 October 2009 |newspaper=The New Zealand Herald |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/news/article.cfm?c_id=6&amp;objectid=10605675}}&lt;/ref&gt; They filmed McCaw gliding at [[Omarama]] on the [[extreme sport]]s series ''Sportstar Insider'', which was hosted by former Australian [[rugby league]] player [[Andrew Ettingshausen]]. After the [[2010 Canterbury earthquake]] he auctioned a personal flying lesson through [[Trade Me]] to raise money for the badly damaged [[Hororata]] St Johns Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nzaviation.com/magazine/2010/11/high-flying-all-blacks-captain-auctions-flight/ |title=High flying All Blacks Captain auctions flight |date=2 November 2010 |work=NZ Aviation Magazine |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101209083447/http://nzaviation.com/magazine/2010/11/high-flying-all-blacks-captain-auctions-flight/ |archivedate=9 December 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also raising money for a young Samoan who broke his neck playing rugby and whose village was destroyed in the [[2009 Samoa earthquake and tsunami]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Richie McCaw's campaign for a young Samoan rugby star |date=12 August 2010 |newspaper=3 News |url=http://www.3news.co.nz/Richie-McCaws-campaign-for-a-young-Samoan-rugby-star/tabid/817/articleID/170418/Default.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--He is a fan of [[Bon Jovi]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Richie has a ball with Bon Jovi |newspaper=New |date=3 February 2008 |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/rugby/news/250443}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; It was revealed at his retirement announcement in 2015 that McCaw would work at Christchurch Helicopters, where he is a Director and Shareholder, and was obtaining a commercial helicopter licence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = McCaw aims for sky post-rugby|url = http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/74211136/richie-mccaw-aims-for-the-sky-in-postrugby-career|website = Stuff|accessdate = 2015-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; McCaw has since obtained said licence and has continued working as a helicopter pilot. He flew several rescue and reconnaissance missions following the [[2016 Kaikoura earthquake]] that struck the South Island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&amp;objectid=11747666 |title=All Blacks great Richie McCaw joins deadly earthquake rescue efforts |first=Kurt |last=Bayer |newspaper=The New Zealand Herald |date=14 November 2016 |accessdate=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also performed milk drops around rural areas of New Zealand while having an endorsement with [[Fonterra]], in which his sister and her husband are dairy farmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fonterra.com/nz/en/what-we-stand-for/fonterra-milk-for-schools/richies-milk-run/find-out-more.html|title=Find Out More|website=www.fonterra.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, McCaw and Dan Carter were on a NZ$750,000 a year contract that saw them through to the end of the [[2011 Rugby World Cup]], making them the highest paid rugby players in New Zealand at the time. This contract would still have applied if they had not been selected for the World Cup squad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Rodney So'oialo, Ali Williams on a roll |first=Greg |last=Ford |newspaper=Star Times |date=14 November 2010 |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/rugby/all-blacks/4343395/Rodney-So-oialo-Ali-Williams-on-a-roll }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Order of New Zealand===
In December 2011, then Prime Minister [[John Key]] revealed that he had asked McCaw about the possibility of a [[New Zealand Order of Merit|knighthood]] in the [[2012 New Year Honours (New Zealand)|2012 New Year Honours]], but that McCaw had turned it down. According to Key, "He made the call that he's still in his playing career and it didn't feel quite right for him, that day where he's no longer on the pitch may be the right time for him." No formal offer was ultimately made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://tvnz.co.nz/all-blacks/mccaw-turns-down-knighthood-4647230 |title=McCaw turns down knighthood |publisher=TVNZ |date=16 December 2011 |accessdate=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; McCaw was appointed a member of New Zealand's highest honour, the [[Order of New Zealand]], in the [[2016 New Year Honours (New Zealand)|2016 New Year Honours]]. The honour surpassed the knighthood he had previously turned down prior to his retirement because only 20 living New Zealanders can gain membership at any one time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Richie McCaw surpasses knighthood, appointed NZ's top honour|url=https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/richie-mccaw-surpasses-knighthood-appointed-nzs-top-honour|accessdate=30 December 2015|work=TVNZ|date=30 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = McCaw joins exclusive club in honours list|url = http://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/news/national/mccaw-joins-exclusive-club-in-honours-list/|website = www.newstalkzb.co.nz|accessdate = 2015-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
