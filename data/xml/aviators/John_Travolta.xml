===Downturn===
[[File:John T color 01.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Travolta in 1983]]
After ''[[Urban Cowboy]]'', Travolta starred in a series of commercial and critical failures that sidelined his acting career. These included ''[[Two of a Kind (1983 film)|Two of a Kind]]'' (1983), a romantic comedy reteaming him with [[Olivia Newton-John]], and ''[[Perfect (film)|Perfect]]'' (1985), co-starring [[Jamie Lee Curtis]]. He also starred in ''[[Staying Alive (1983 film)|Staying Alive]]'', the 1983 sequel to ''Saturday Night Fever'', for which he trained rigorously and lost 20 pounds;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title='Staying Alive' Revives Travolta |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/10/arts/staying-alive-revives-travolta.html |first=Stephan |last=Farber |publisher=''The New York Times'' |date=July 10, 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; the film was a financial success, grossing over $65 million, though it too was scorned by critics.

During that time Travolta was offered, but declined, lead roles in what would become box-office hits, including ''[[American Gigolo]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/highconcept-high-roller-1317555.html |title=High-concept high roller |work=The Independent |first=Kevin |last=Jackson |date=February 6, 1996 |accessdate=August 26, 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[An Officer and a Gentleman]]'', both of which went to [[Richard Gere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/john-travolta-goes-the-whole-hog-with-his-new-hit-movie-443516.html |title=John Travolta goes the whole Hog with his new hit movie |work=The Independent |date=April 6, 2007 |accessdate=August 26, 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resurgence===
[[File:John Travolta 1997.jpg|thumb|upright|Travolta in 1997]]
In 1989, Travolta starred with [[Kirstie Alley]] in ''[[Look Who's Talking]]'', which grossed $297&amp;nbsp;million making it his most successful film since ''Grease''. Next came ''[[Look Who's Talking Too]]'' (1990) and ''[[Look Who's Talking Now]]'' (1993) but it was not until he played [[Vincent Vega]] in [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s hit ''[[Pulp Fiction]]'' (1994), for which he received an [[Academy Award]] nomination, that his career revived.&lt;ref name=tca/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/1995/10/15/PK67911.DTL&amp;type=printable |title=Making Movies With the Mob / John Travolta stars as gangster producer in Elmore Leonard's 'Get Shorty' |publisher=Sfgate.com |date=October 15, 1995 |accessdate=August 26, 2009 | first=Mick | last=Lasalle}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=James |first=Caryn |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A03EEDB1E3EF931A35751C1A9629C8B63 |title=CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK; As Praise Flows, Travolta Awaits His 3rd Comeback |work=New York Times |date=December 2, 2004 |accessdate=August 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movie shifted him back onto the [[A-list]], and he was inundated with offers. Notable roles following ''Pulp Fiction'' include a movie-buff [[loan shark]] in ''[[Get Shorty (film)|Get Shorty]]'' (1995), an FBI agent and terrorist in ''[[Face/Off]]'' (1997), a desperate attorney in ''[[A Civil Action (film)|A Civil Action]]'' (1998), a [[Bill Clinton]]-esque presidential candidate in ''[[Primary Colors (film)|Primary Colors]]'' (1998),&lt;ref name=tca/&gt; and a military investigator in ''[[The General's Daughter (film)|The General's Daughter]]'' (1999).

===2000–present===

In 2000, Travolta starred in and co-produced the science fiction film ''[[Battlefield Earth (film)|Battlefield Earth]]'', based on [[Battlefield Earth (novel)|the novel of the same name]] by [[L. Ron Hubbard]], in which he played the leader of a group of aliens that enslaves humanity on a bleak future Earth. The film had been a dream project for Travolta since the book's release in 1982, when Hubbard had personally written him to try to help make a film adaptation.&lt;ref name="hs"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Staff|title=Science Friction|work=Herald Sun |location=Australia|date=April 12, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film received almost universally negative reviews and did very poorly at the box office.&lt;ref&gt;{{rotten-tomatoes|battlefield_earth}}&lt;/ref&gt; Travolta's performance in ''Battlefield Earth'' also earned him two [[Golden Raspberry Award|Razzie Awards]].

Throughout the 2000s, Travolta remained busy as an actor, starring in many films including ''[[Swordfish (film)|Swordfish]]'' (2001), ''[[Ladder 49]]'' (2004), ''[[Be Cool]]'' (2005), ''[[Wild Hogs]]'' (2007), the animated film ''[[Bolt (2008 film)|Bolt]]'' (2008), in which Travolta voiced the [[Bolt (Disney character)|title character]], ''[[The Taking of Pelham 123 (2009 film)|The Taking of Pelham 123]]'' and ''[[Old Dogs (film)|Old Dogs]]'' (both 2009).

In 2007, Travolta played Edna Turnblad in the remake of ''[[Hairspray (2007 film)|Hairspray]]'', his first musical since ''Grease''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stv.tv/content/out/film/displayHotnow.html?id=opencms%3A%2Fout%2Fhotnow%2Ffilms%2FExclusivex_John_Travolta_on_becoming_a_w |title=''Travolta on becoming a woman'', interview with stv/movies, June 2007 |accessdate=2017-04-26 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219204211/http://www.stv.tv/content/out/film/displayHotnow.html?id=opencms%3A%2Fout%2Fhotnow%2Ffilms%2FExclusivex_John_Travolta_on_becoming_a_w |archivedate=December 19, 2007 |df= }} [[stv.tv]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2010, Travolta has starred mostly in [[action film]]s and [[thriller film|thrillers]].

Travolta was in a relationship with actress [[Diana Hyland]], whom he met while filming ''[[The Boy in the Plastic Bubble]]''.

Travolta married actress [[Kelly Preston]] in 1991, and bought a house in [[Islesboro, Maine]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/john-travolta-and-kelly-preston-maine-house Tour John Travolta and Kelly Preston's Shingle Style Home in Maine | Architectural Digest] Retrieved 2017-04-27.&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had a son, Jett.

In May 1991, ''Time'' magazine published a cover story entitled "[[The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power]]".  In the article, former [[Church of Scientology]] Executive Director William Franks alleged that Travolta was wary of leaving the faith because he feared the Church would publish detailed revelations of his private life, to include homosexual behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Behar|first=Richard|title=The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power| url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,972865,00.html |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=February 24, 2015|date=May 6, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; These claims were reiterated by Franks and other Scientology defectors in Lawrence Wright's 2013 book ''[[Going Clear (book)|Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood, and the Prison of Belief]]'', and former Church official [[Marty Rathbun]] claimed that he worked with Travolta's attorneys several times to keep allegations about Travolta's homosexuality out of the press and resolve lawsuits against the star.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wright |first=Lawrence |date=2013 |title=Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood, and the Prison of Belief |publisher=Vintage Books, A Division of [[Random House]]|isbn=978-0307745309|pages=199, 383}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Yahr|first1=Emily|title=How Scientology controls John Travolta and Tom Cruise, according to 'Going Clear'|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2015/03/30/how-scientology-controls-john-travolta-and-tom-cruise-according-to-going-clear/|accessdate=November 1, 2017|work=Washington Post|date=March 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexual assault allegations===
In May 2012, an anonymous masseur filed a lawsuit against Travolta citing claims of sexual assault and battery. A lawyer for Travolta said that the allegations were "complete fiction and fabrication" and someone wanting their [[15 minutes of fame]]. Travolta's counsel also stated that his client would be able to prove that he was not in California on the day in question and asserted that Travolta would "sue the attorney and Plaintiff for malicious prosecution" after getting the case thrown out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John Travolta Sued for Assault and Sexual Battery by Masseur, Actor's Rep Calls Claim a "Baseless Lie"|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/john_travolta_sued_assault_sexual/314284|publisher=E!

A judge ruled to dismiss a defamation lawsuit against Travolta and his attorney Marty Singer by writer Robert Randolph. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Malcolm Mackey dismissed the case on September 27, 2012, because he found that a letter, written by Singer in response to allegations in a book by Randolph, had free speech protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Matthews|first=KJ|title=Lawsuit against John Travolta dismissed, again|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/09/28/showbiz/travolta-lawsuit/index.html|publisher=CNN|accessdate=September 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2014, Travolta denied claims made in January 2014 by his former pilot, Douglas Gotterba, that they had shared a sexual relationship while working for Travolta's aircraft company, Alto, for six years before leaving voluntarily in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/john-travolta-addresses-allegations-made-by-his-former-pilot-that-he-used-to-be-in-a-gay-relationship-with-him-9736104.html | location=London | work=The Independent | title=John Travolta addresses former pilot's gay romance allegations publicly for the first time | date=September 16, 2014 | first=Jenn | last=Selby}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Travolta was named in a criminal complaint by a masseur who accused the actor of sexual battery that reportedly took place in 2000. The masseur was aged 21 at the time.&lt;ref name="news.com.au"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/celebrity-life/celebrities-gone-bad/john-travolta-accused-of-sexual-battery-by-male-masseur-police-report/news-story/289654c615447c187613cd098331d99d |title=John Travolta accused of 'sexual battery' by male masseur: police report |date=November 15, 2017 |work=news.com.au |access-date=January 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Son's death===
In 2009, Travolta's son, Jett, died at age 16 while on a Christmas vacation in the [[The Bahamas|Bahamas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Jett Travolta, son of actors, dies at 16 |work=CNN |url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/Movies/01/02/obit.jett.travolta/ |date=January 2, 2009 |accessdate=January 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='bbcnews20090102'&gt;{{cite news |title=John Travolta's teenage son dies |url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7809172.stm |work=BBC News Online |publisher=BBC |accessdate=January 2, 2009 | date=January 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Bahamian death certificate was issued, attributing the cause of death to a [[seizure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/MindMoodNews/story?id=6576215&amp;page=1 |title=Death Certificate: John Travolta's Son Died of a Seizure |publisher=ABC News |date=January 5, 2009 |accessdate=January 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jett, who had a history of seizures, reportedly suffered from [[Kawasaki disease]] at the age of two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20249865,00.html |title=John Travolta's 16-Year-Old Son Dies |work=[[People (American magazine)|People]] |date=January 2, 2009 |accessdate=January 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Errico |first=Marcus |url=http://uk.eonline.com/uberblog/b77259_john_travoltas_son_jett_dead_16.html |title=John Travolta's Son Jett Dead at 16 |publisher=[[E!]] Online |date=January 2, 2009 |accessdate=January 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Travolta confirmed speculation that his son had [[autism]] and suffered regular seizures and immediately made his public statements while giving testimony after a multimillion-dollar extortion plot against him in connection to his son's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Mary Rose |last=Abraham |title=From John Travolta: I Ran Down the Stairs To Help My Son |publisher=ABC News |date=September 23, 2009 |accessdate=September 23, 2009 |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/john-travolta-bahamas-testify-extortion-case/story?id=8649816}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a mistrial, Travolta dropped the charges and has credited his immediate family and Scientology with helping him survive the death of his son and in moving forward with his film career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Usborne |first=David |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/judge-declares-mistrial-in-travolta-extortion-case-1807653.html |title=Judge declares mistrial in Travolta extortion case |work=The Independent |date=October 23, 2009 |accessdate=June 28, 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Allen |first=Nick |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/7985783/John-Travolta-to-drop-charges-in-extortion-case.html |title=John Travolta to drop charges in extortion case |work=The Telegraph |date=September 6, 2010 |accessdate=June 28, 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/01/28/john-travolta-scientology_n_441399.html |title=John Travolta: Scientology Helped Me Heal |publisher=huffingtonpost.com |date=January 28, 2010 |accessdate=June 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In memory of his son, Travolta created the Jett Travolta Foundation, a non-profit organization to help children with special needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jett-travolta-foundation.org/ |title=The Jett Travolta Foundation |publisher=jett-travolta-foundation.org |deadurl=no  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925194147/https://jett-travolta-foundation.org/ |archivedate=September 25, 2015 |accessdate=August 8, 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has contributed to organizations such as the [[Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy]], [[The Institutes for the Achievement of Human Potential]], and the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.jett-travolta-foundation.org/donated/index.html |title=The Jett Travolta Foundation Donated |publisher=jett-travolta-foundation.org }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
Travolta has been a practitioner of [[Scientology]] since 1975 when he was given the book ''[[Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health|Dianetics]]'' while filming the movie ''[[The Devil's Rain]]'' in [[Durango]], Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Successes of Scientology |url=http://www.whatisscientology.org/html/Part05/chp19/pg0308.html |publisher=Church of Scientology International |date=May 2007 |accessdate=May 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]], joining other celebrities in helping with the relief efforts, Travolta reportedly flew his [[Boeing 707]] full of supplies, doctors, and Scientologist [[Volunteer Ministers]] into the disaster area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=John Travolta's mercy flight to Haiti |url=http://marquee.blogs.cnn.com/2010/01/25/john-travoltas-mercy-flight-to-haiti/?hpt=T2 |publisher=Douglas Hyde – CNN Entertainment Producer |date=January 25, 2010 |accessdate=January 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
