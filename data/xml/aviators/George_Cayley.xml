'''Sir George Cayley, 6th Baronet''' (27 December 1773 – 15 December 1857) was an English engineer, inventor, and aviator. He is one of the most important people in the history of [[aeronautics]]. Many consider him to be the first true scientific aerial investigator and the first person to understand the underlying principles and forces of [[flight]].&lt;ref name="Father of aviation"&gt;

He was a pioneer of [[aeronautical engineering]] and is sometimes referred to as "the father of aviation."&lt;ref name="Father of aviation"/&gt; He discovered and identified the four forces which act on a heavier-than-air flying vehicle: [[weight]], [[Lift (force)|lift]], [[Drag (physics)|drag]] and [[thrust]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Modern aeroplane design is based on those discoveries and on the importance of [[Camber (aerodynamics)|cambered wings]], also identified by Cayley.&lt;ref&gt;[[C. H.

He designed the first glider reliably reported to carry a human aloft. He correctly predicted that sustained flight would not occur until a lightweight engine was developed to provide adequate thrust and lift.&lt;ref name="Pioneers"/&gt; The [[Wright brothers]] acknowledged his importance to the development of aviation.&lt;ref name="Pioneers"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Pioneers: Aviation and Airmodelling |url=http://www.ctie.monash.edu.au/hargrave/cayley.html |publisher=  |accessdate=26 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cayley represented the [[British Whig Party|Whig]] party as [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Scarborough (UK Parliament constituency)|Scarborough]] from 1832 to 1835, and in 1838, helped found the UK's first Polytechnic Institute, the Royal Polytechnic Institution (now [[University of Westminster]]) and served as its chairman for many years. He was a founding member of the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]] and was a distant cousin of the [[mathematics|mathematician]] [[Arthur Cayley]].

==General engineering projects==
Cayley, from [[Brompton, Scarborough|Brompton-by-Sawdon]], near [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]] in [[Yorkshire]], inherited Brompton Hall and [[Wydale Hall]] and other estates on the death of his father, the 5th baronet.  Captured by the optimism of the times, he engaged in a wide variety of [[engineering]] projects.  Among the many things that he developed are self-righting [[Lifeboat (rescue)|lifeboat]]s, [[Wire wheels|tension-spoke wheel]]s,
&lt;ref&gt;In his notebook, dated March 19, 1808, Cayley proposed that in order to produce "the lightest possible wheel for aerial navigation cars," one should "do away with wooden spokes altogether and refer the whole firmness of the wheel to the strength of the rim only, by the intervention of tight strong cording … "  See:  J.A.D. Ackroyd (2011) [http://aerosociety.com/Assets/Docs/Publications/The%20Journal%20of%20Aeronautical%20History/2011-06Cayley-Ackroyd2.pdf "Sir George Cayley:  The invention of the aeroplane near Scarborough at the time of Trafalgar,"] ''Journal of Aeronautical History'' [Internet publication], paper no. 6, pages 130–181.  Cayley's tension-spoke wheel appears on page 152, "3.7  The Tension  Wheel, 1808".&lt;/ref&gt; the "Universal Railway" (his term for [[caterpillar track|caterpillar tractors]]),&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_roAAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA225#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Sir George Cayley's patent universal railway,"] ''Mechanics' Magazine'', '''5''' (127) :  225–227 (January 28, 1826).&lt;/ref&gt; automatic signals for railway crossings,&lt;ref&gt;George Cayley (February 13, 1841) [https://books.google.com/books?id=E9tQAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=PA180&amp;ots=ZxdTdnUfpZ&amp;pg=PA129#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Essay on the means of promoting safety in railway carriages,"] ''Mechanics' Magazine'', '''34''' (914) :  129–133.

==Flying machines==
[[File:Governableparachute.jpg|thumb|upright|Cayley's glider in ''Mechanics Magazine'', 1852]]
He is mainly remembered for his pioneering studies and experiments with [[flying machine]]s, including the working, piloted [[glider aircraft|glider]] that he designed and built. He wrote a landmark three-part treatise titled "On Aerial Navigation" (1809–1810),&lt;ref name="AerNav123"&gt;''Cayley, George''. "On Aerial Navigation" [http://www.aeronautics.nasa.gov/fap/OnAerialNavigationPt1.pdf Part 1] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511071413/http://www.aeronautics.nasa.gov/fap/OnAerialNavigationPt1.pdf |date=11 May 2013 }} , [http://www.aeronautics.nasa.gov/fap/OnAerialNavigationPt2.pdf Part 2] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511041814/http://www.aeronautics.nasa.gov/fap/OnAerialNavigationPt2.pdf |date=11 May 2013 }} , [http://www.aeronautics.nasa.gov/fap/OnAerialNavigationPt3.pdf Part 3] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511052409/http://www.aeronautics.nasa.gov/fap/OnAerialNavigationPt3.pdf |date=11 May 2013 }} ''Nicholson's Journal of Natural Philosophy'', 1809–1810.

Retrieved: 30 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; which was published in [[William Nicholson (chemist)|Nicholson]]'s ''Journal of Natural Philosophy, Chemistry and the Arts''. The 2007 discovery of sketches in Cayley's school notebooks (held in the archive of the [[Royal Aeronautical Society]] Library)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.adsadvance.co.uk/sir-george-cayley-s-notebooks-featured-on-antiques-roadshow.html&lt;/ref&gt; revealed that even at school Cayley was developing his ideas on the theories of flight. It has been claimed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Dee |first= Richard |authorlink= Richard Dee |coauthors= |title= The Man who Discovered Flight: George Cayley and the First Airplane |year= 2007|publisher= McClelland and Stewart|location= Toronto |isbn= 978-0-7710-2971-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that these images indicate that Cayley identified the principle of a lift-generating inclined plane as early as 1792. To measure the drag on objects at different speeds and angles of attack, he later built a "whirling-arm apparatus", a development of earlier work in ballistics and air resistance. He also experimented with rotating wing sections of various forms in the stairwells at Brompton Hall.

{{Quote box|width=28%|align=left|quote="About 100 years ago, an Englishman, Sir George Cayley, carried the science of flight to a point which it had never reached before and which it scarcely reached again during the last century."|source =— [[Wilbur Wright]], 1909.&lt;ref name="Pioneers"/&gt;}}
These scientific experiments led him to develop an efficient [[camber (aerodynamics)|cambered]] [[airfoil]] and to identify the four vector forces that influence an aircraft: ''thrust'', ''lift'', ''drag'', and ''gravity''. He discovered the importance of the [[dihedral (aircraft)|dihedral]] angle for lateral stability in flight, and deliberately set the [[centre of gravity]] of many of his models well below the wings for this reason; these principles influenced the development of [[hang gliders]]. As a result of his investigations into many other theoretical aspects of flight, many now acknowledge him as the first [[aerospace engineer|aeronautical engineer]].  His emphasis on lightness led him to invent a new method of constructing [[wire wheel|lightweight wheels]] which is in common use today.  For his landing wheels, he shifted the spoke's forces from [[compression (physical)|compression]] to [[Tension (physics)|tension]] by making them from tightly-stretched string, in effect "reinventing the wheel".&lt;ref name="FG54"&gt;Pritchard, J.

[[File:George Cayley Glider (Nigel Coates).jpg|thumb|right||Replica of Cayley's glider at the Yorkshire Air Museum]]
The model glider successfully flown by Cayley in 1804 had the layout of a modern aircraft, with a kite-shaped wing towards the front and an adjustable  tailplane at the back consisting of [[horizontal stabiliser]]s and a [[Vertical stabilizer|vertical fin]].  A movable weight allowed adjustment of the model's [[centre of gravity]].&lt;ref&gt;Gibbs-Smith 2002, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;  Around 1843 he was the first to suggest the idea for a convertiplane, an idea which was published in a paper written that same year.  At some time before 1849 he designed and built a biplane in which an unknown ten-year-old boy flew. Later, with the continued assistance of his grandson George John Cayley and his resident engineer Thomas Vick, he developed a larger scale glider (also probably fitted with "flappers") which flew across Brompton Dale in front of [[Wydale Hall]] in 1853. The first adult aviator has been claimed to be either Cayley's coachman, footman or butler: one source ([[Charles Harvard Gibbs-Smith|Gibbs-Smith]]) has suggested that it was John Appleby, a Cayley employee: however there is no definitive evidence to fully identify the pilot. An entry in volume IX of the 8th Encyclopædia Britannica of 1855 is the most contemporaneous authoritative account regarding the event. A 2007 biography of Cayley (Richard Dee's ''The Man Who Discovered Flight: George Cayley and the First Airplane'') claims the first pilot was Cayley's grandson George John Cayley (1826–1878).

A replica of the 1853 machine was flown at the original site in Brompton Dale by [[Derek Piggott]] in 1973&lt;ref name="glidmag1"&gt;Piggott, Derek.

[[File:George Cayley Plaque 309 Regent Street.jpg|thumb|right|Plaque at 309 Regent Street]]
Cayley is commemorated in Scarborough at the [[University of Hull, Scarborough Campus]], where a [[hall of residence]] and a teaching building are named after him. He is one of many scientists and engineers commemorated by having a hall of residence and a bar at [[Loughborough University]] named after him. The [[University of Westminster]] also honours Cayley's contribution to the formation of the institution with a gold plaque at the entrance of the [[Regent Street]] building.

There are display boards and a video film at the [[Royal Air Force Museum London]] in Hendon honouring Cayley's achievements and a modern exhibition and film "Pioneers of Aviation" at the Yorkshire Air Museum, Elvington,York. The Sir George Cayley Sailwing Club is a Yorkshire-based free flight club, affiliated to the British Hang Gliding and Paragliding Association, which has borne his name since its founding in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cayleyparagliding.co.uk/ |title=Sir George Cayley Sailwing Club |publisher=cayleyparagliding.co.uk |accessdate=July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
