'''Charles E. McGee ''' (born December 7, 1919) is a retired [[African-American]] [[fighter pilot]] who was one of the [[Tuskegee Airmen]] and a career officer in the [[United States Air Force]] for 30 years who flew a total of 409 combat missions in World War II, Korea and Vietnam.

==Early years==
McGee was born in Cleveland, Ohio on December 7, 1919, to Lewis Allen and Ruth Elizabeth Lewis McGee who died shortly after the birth of his sister. His father was, at times, a teacher, social worker and Methodist minister, jobs that led to frequent moves.&lt;ref&gt;Smith and McGee 199. pp. 12–14.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a youth, McGee was a member of the [[Boy Scouts of America]] and earned the [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]] award on August 9, 1940. He later served in district and regional positions in the BSA. At the [[2010 National Scout Jamboree]], he was recognized with the [[Distinguished Eagle Scout Award]].&lt;ref name="Maw"&gt;Maw, Michael.

==World War II== 
In March 1942, McGee was a sophomore at the [[University of Illinois]] studying engineering. While at the University of Illinois he was a member of the National Society of [[Pershing Rifles]]. He also became a member of the Tau chapter of [[Alpha Phi Alpha]] fraternity. After enlisting in the US Army on October 26, 1942, he became a part of the Tuskegee Airmen having earned his [[United States Aviator Badge|pilot's wings]], and graduating from Class 43-F on June 30, 1943.&lt;ref name="Tuskegee"&gt;Francis and Caso 1997, p. 323.&lt;/ref&gt;

By February 1944, McGee was stationed in Italy with the 302nd Fighter Squadron of the [[332d Fighter Group]], flying his first mission on February 14.&lt;ref name="Tuskegee"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sherman, Stephen. [http://acepilots.com/usaaf_tusk.html "The Tuskegee Airmen: First Group of African-American Fighter Pilots in WW2."] ''acepilots.com'', June 29, 2011. Retrieved: January 2, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; McGee flew the [[Bell P-39 Airacobra|Bell P-39Q Airacobra]], [[Republic P-47 Thunderbolt|Republic P-47D Thunderbolt]] and [[North American P-51 Mustang]] fighter aircraft, escorting [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator]] and [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]] bombers over Germany, Austria and the Balkans. During missions, he also engaged in low level attacks over enemy airfields and rail yards.&lt;ref&gt;Tillman 2012, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 23, 1944, while escorting B-17s over Czechoslovakia, McGee engaged a formation of [[Luftwaffe]] fighters and downed a [[Focke Wulf Fw 190]].&lt;ref name="Eagle"&gt;"[http://www.afhra.af.mil/Portals/16/documents/Timelines/World%20War%20II/Misconceptions_About_the_Tuskegee_Airmen.pdf?ver=2016-09-02-115550-823 Misconceptions About the Tuskegee Airmen]." ''Air Force Historical Research Agency.'' Retrieved: February 16, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

Promoted to Captain, McGee had flown a total of 137 combat missions, and had returned to the United States on December 1, 1944, to become an instructor on the [[North American B-25 Mitchell]] bombers that another unit of the Tuskegee Airmen were working up. He remained at Tuskegee Army Air Field until 1946, when the base was closed.&lt;ref name="Tuskegee"/&gt;

==Postwar==
After World War II, McGee was sent to Lockbourne Army Air Field (now Rickenbacker ANGB, Columbus, Ohio) to become the base operations and training officer, later in 1948, being posted to an  Aircraft Maintenance Technical Course and was assigned to an air refueling unit. When the [[Korean War]] broke out, he flew P-51 Mustangs again in the 67th Fighter Bomber Squadron, completing 100 missions, and was promoted to major. Continuing his service with the [[United States Air Force]] as it was reconstituted, McGee continued to serve as a fighter pilot, flying [[Lockheed P-80 Shooting Star|Lockheed F-80 Shooting Star]] and [[Northrop F-89 Scorpion]] aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Ray, Mark. "National Treasure: Decorated Col. Charles McGee Continues to Impact America's Youth." ''Eagle Scout Magazine,'' Winter 2010,  pp. 5–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Vietnam war]], as a Lt. Colonel, McGee flew 172 combat missions in a [[McDonnell F-4 Phantom II|McDonnell RF-4]] photo-reconnaissance aircraft. During his Southeast Asia combat tour, then-LT COL McGee served as the Squadron Commander of the 16th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron (TRS), of the 460th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing, of which was based at Tan Son Nhut Air Base, in South Vietnam.  The 16th TRS flew the RF-4C "photo-recce" Phantom II jet aircraft.

In a 30-year active service career, he achieved a three-war fighter mission total of 409 combat missions, one of the highest by any Air Force fighter pilot.&lt;ref name="Eagle"/&gt;

After a series of other appointments both in the United States as well as in Italy and Germany, and promotion to Colonel, McGee retired on January 31, 1973.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper et al. 1996, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; He ended his military career with 6,308 flying hours.&lt;ref name="Tuskegee1"&gt;Francis and Caso 1997, p. 324.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==
After his military service, McGee held many prestigious functional and honorary positions around the field of aviation. In 1978, at the age of 58, he completed the college degree at [[Columbia College (Missouri)|Columbia College]] in Kansas City, over thirty years after his initial enrollment at the University of Illinois. Though interrupted by World War II, attaining a college degree had been a lifelong goal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccis.edu/connections/article.asp?i=33&amp;a=202 "Flying high: interview with Col. Charles McGee."] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150103080017/http://www.ccis.edu/connections/article.asp?i=33&amp;a=202 |date=January 3, 2015 }} ''Columbia College Spotlight'', July 2008. Retrieved: August 14, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

McGee served as the Director of the Kansas City airport and as a member of the Aviation Advisory Commission. For over 30 years, he has been an ambassador of the Tuskegee Airmen, Inc., giving numerous public addresses and has received accolades including the National Aeronautical Associations "Elder Statesman of Aviation." McGee served as National President of the Association from 1983 to 1985, and is currently serving as its president.&lt;ref name="Eagle"/&gt;

In 2005, McGee intended to be part of a group of former Tuskegee Airmen, who flew to Balad, Iraq, to speak to active duty airmen serving in the [[332nd Air Expeditionary Wing]], the current incarnation of the 332nd Fighter Group.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/iraq/2005-10-22-tuskegee-airmen_x.htm "Tuskegee Airmen suit up, head to Iraq."] ''USA Today,'' October 22, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, McGee was hospitalized prior to the trip and was unable to go.

==Honors==
McGee was recognized for his combat and military service with a number of awards including: Distinguished Flying Cross with two Oak Leaf Clusters, Legion of Merit with one Oak Leaf Cluster, Bronze Star, Air Medal with 25 Oak Leaf Clusters, [[Army Commendation Medal]], Presidential Unit Citation, Korean Presidential Unit Citation, Hellenic Republic World War II Commemorative Medal along with related campaign and service ribbons. In 2007, President [[George W. Bush]] awarded McGee and all other surviving Tuskegee Airmen the Congressional Gold Medal, the nation's highest civilian award.&lt;ref name="Tuskegee1"/&gt;

In 2011, McGee was inducted into the [[National Aviation Hall of Fame]] in Dayton, Ohio. He also served as a consultant to the 2012 [[George Lucas]] film, ''[[Red Tails]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccis.edu/connections/article.asp?i=94&amp;a=856 "Columbia College alumnus Col.
