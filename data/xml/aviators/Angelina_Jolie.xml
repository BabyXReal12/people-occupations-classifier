She has received an [[Academy Award]], two [[Screen Actors Guild Awards]], and three [[Golden Globe Awards]], and has been cited as Hollywood's highest-paid actress. Jolie made her screen debut as a child alongside her father, [[Jon Voight]], in ''[[Lookin' to Get Out]]'' (1982). Her film career began in earnest a decade later with the low-budget production ''[[Cyborg 2]]'' (1993), followed by her first leading role in a major film, ''[[Hackers (film)|Hackers]]'' (1995). She starred in the critically acclaimed biographical cable films ''[[George Wallace (film)|George Wallace]]'' (1997) and ''[[Gia]]'' (1998), and won an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for her performance in the drama ''[[Girl, Interrupted (film)|Girl, Interrupted]]'' (1999).

Jolie's starring role as the video game heroine [[Lara Croft]] in ''[[Lara Croft: Tomb Raider]]'' (2001) established her as a leading Hollywood actress. She continued her successful action-star career with ''[[Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith (2005 film)|Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith]]'' (2005), ''[[Wanted (2008 film)|Wanted]]'' (2008), and ''[[Salt (2010 film)|Salt]]'' (2010), and received critical acclaim for her performances in the dramas ''[[A Mighty Heart (film)|A Mighty Heart]]'' (2007) and ''[[Changeling (film)|Changeling]]'' (2008), which earned her a nomination for an [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]. Her biggest commercial success came with the fantasy picture ''[[Maleficent (film)|Maleficent]]'' (2014). In the 2010s, Jolie expanded her career into directing, screenwriting, and producing, with ''[[In the Land of Blood and Honey]]'' (2011), ''[[Unbroken (film)|Unbroken]]'' (2014), ''[[By the Sea (2015 film)|By the Sea]]'' (2015), and ''[[First They Killed My Father (film)|First They Killed My Father]]'' (2017).

In addition to her film career, Jolie is noted for her humanitarian efforts, for which she has received a [[Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award]] and an honorary damehood of the [[Order of St Michael and St George]] (DCMG), among other honors. She promotes various causes, including conservation, education, and women's rights, and is most noted for her advocacy on behalf of refugees as a [[Special Envoy]] for the [[UNHCR|United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR). As a public figure, Jolie has been cited as one of the most influential and powerful people in the American entertainment industry. For a number of years, she was cited as the world's most beautiful woman by various media outlets, and her personal life is the subject of wide publicity. Divorced from actors [[Jonny Lee Miller]] and [[Billy Bob Thornton]], she separated from her third husband, actor [[Brad Pitt]], in September 2016. They have six children together, three of whom were adopted internationally.

==Early life and family==
Born in Los Angeles, California, Jolie is the daughter of actors [[Jon Voight]] and [[Marcheline Bertrand]].

After her parents' separation in 1976, Jolie and her brother lived with their mother, who had abandoned her acting ambitions to focus on raising her children.&lt;ref name="Angelina Jolie: Body Beautiful"&gt;{{cite magazine | last=Van Meter | first=Jonathan | url=http://www.style.com/vogue/feature/032602/page2.html | title=Angelina Jolie: Body Beautiful | magazine=Vogue | date=April 2002 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020606140742/http://www.style.com/vogue/feature/032602/page2.html |archivedate=June 6, 2002 | deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother raised her Catholic, but did not require her to go to church.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2008/07/jolie200807|title=A Woman in Full|last=Cohen|first=Rich|work=Vanities|access-date=2017-09-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a child, she often watched films with her mother and it was this, rather than her father's successful career, that inspired her interest in acting,&lt;ref name="Angelina Jolie Biography"&gt;{{cite web | last=Wills | first=Dominic | url=http://www.talktalk.co.uk/entertainment/film/biography/artist/angelina-jolie/biography/3 | title=Angelina Jolie Biography | publisher=TalkTalk | accessdate=December 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; though at age five she had a bit part in Voight's ''[[Lookin' to Get Out]]'' (1982).&lt;ref name="Blood, Sugar, Sex, Magic"/&gt; When Jolie was six years old, Bertrand and her live-in partner, filmmaker [[Bill Day (filmmaker)|Bill Day]], moved the family to [[Palisades, New York]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | last=Jerome | first=Jim | url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20084718,00.html | title=For Single Father Jon Voight 'Table for Five' Is a Story Close to His Own Painful Experience | magazine=People | date=April 11, 1983 | accessdate=December 28, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; they returned to Los Angeles five years later.&lt;ref name="Angelina Jolie: Body Beautiful"/&gt; Jolie then decided she wanted to act and enrolled at the [[Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute]], where she trained for two years and appeared in several stage productions.

Jolie first attended [[Beverly Hills High School]], where she felt isolated among the children of some of the area's affluent families because her mother survived on a more modest income. She was teased by other students, who targeted her for being extremely thin and for wearing glasses and braces.&lt;ref name="Angelina Jolie Biography"/&gt; Her early attempts at modeling, at her mother's insistence, proved unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="Parade 2010"&gt;{{cite magazine | last=Rader | first=Dotson | url= http://parade.com/131662/dotsonrader/angelina-jolie-taming-her-wild-heart/ | title=Angelina Jolie: Taming Her Wild Heart | magazine=Parade | date=July 11, 2010 | accessdate=December 28, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Elias | first=Justine | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/25/tv/cover-story-a-chic-heroine-but-not-a-pretty-story.html | title= A Chic Heroine, but Not a Pretty Story | newspaper=The New York Times |date=January 25, 1998 | accessdate=January 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She then transferred to Moreno High School, an [[alternative school]], where she became a "punk outsider,"&lt;ref name="Parade 2010"/&gt; wearing all-black clothing, going out [[moshing]], and experimenting with [[knife play]] with her live-in boyfriend.&lt;ref name="Angelina Jolie Biography"/&gt; She dropped out of her acting classes and aspired to become a funeral director,&lt;ref name="Blood, Sugar, Sex, Magic"&gt;{{cite magazine | last=Heath | first=Chris | url=http://madeinatlantis.com/angelina_jolie/interview2.htm | title = Blood, Sugar, Sex, Magic | magazine=Rolling Stone | date=July 5, 2001 | accessdate=December 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; taking at-home courses to study embalming.&lt;ref name="And Baby Makes Two"&gt;{{cite magazine | last=Tauber | first=Michelle | url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20140693,00.html | title=And Baby Makes Two | magazine=People | date=August 4, 2003 | accessdate=January 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At age 16, after the relationship had ended, Jolie graduated from high school and rented her own apartment, before returning to theater studies,&lt;ref name="Angelina Jolie: Body Beautiful"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Parade 2010"/&gt; though in 2004 she referred to this period with the observation, "I am still at heart—and always will be—just a punk kid with tattoos."&lt;ref name="Learning To Fly"&gt;{{cite magazine | last=Van Meter| first=Jonathan | url= http://www.style.com/vogue/feature/022304/page2.html | title=Learning to Fly | magazine=Vogue | date=March 2004 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20040504212442/http://www.style.com/vogue/feature/022304/page2.html |archivedate=May 4, 2004 | deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a teenager, Jolie found it difficult to emotionally connect with other people, and as a result she [[self-harm]]ed,&lt;ref name="Wild at heart"&gt;{{cite magazine | last=Sessums | first=Kevin | url= http://www.wutheringjolie.com/nuke/modules.php?name=Content&amp;pa=showpage&amp;pid=449 | title=Wild at Heart | magazine=Allure | date=November 2004 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161110121918/http://www.wutheringjolie.com/nuke/modules.php?name=Content&amp;pa=showpage&amp;pid=449 |archive-date=November 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; later commenting, "For some reason, the ritual of having cut myself and feeling the pain, maybe feeling alive, feeling some kind of release, it was somehow therapeutic to me."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | last=Zahn | first=Paula (host) | title=Angelina Jolie Profile | series=Paula Zahn Now | date=June 9, 2005 | url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0506/09/pzn.01.html | network=CNN | accessdate=December 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also struggled with [[insomnia]] and an [[eating disorder]],&lt;ref name="And Baby Makes Two"/&gt; and began experimenting with drugs; by age 20, she had used "just about every drug possible," particularly [[heroin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/%27Sick+Boy%27+weds+former+addict.-a061316656 | title='Sick Boy' weds former addict | newspaper=Daily Mirror | date=May 3, 1996 | accessdate=December 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jolie suffered episodes of depression and twice planned to commit suicide—at age 19 and again at 22, when she attempted to hire a hitman to kill her.&lt;ref name="Blood, Sugar, Sex, Magic"/&gt; When she was 24, she experienced a [[nervous breakdown]] and was admitted for [[5150 (Involuntary psychiatric hold)|72 hours]] to [[Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center|UCLA Medical Center]]'s psychiatric ward.&lt;ref name="Blood, Sugar, Sex, Magic"/&gt; Two years later, after adopting her first child, Jolie found stability in her life, later stating, "I knew once I committed to Maddox, I would never be self-destructive again."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Wloszczyna | first=Susan | url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/story/2011-12-08/2011-angelina-jolie/51752708/1 | title=Jolie in charge, as director and mom | newspaper=USA Today | date=December 9, 2011 | accessdate=December 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===1991–1997: Early work===
Jolie committed to acting professionally at the age of 16, but initially found it difficult to pass auditions, often being told that her demeanor was "too dark."&lt;ref name="Blood, Sugar, Sex, Magic"/&gt; She appeared in five of her brother's student films, made while he attended the [[USC School of Cinema-Television]], as well as in several music videos, namely [[Lenny Kravitz]]'s "Stand by My Woman" (1991), [[Antonello Venditti]]'s "Alta Marea" (1991), [[The Lemonheads]]'s "It's About Time" (1993), and [[Meat Loaf]]'s "[[Rock and Roll Dreams Come Through]]" (1993). She began to learn from her father, as she noticed his method of observing people to become like them. Their relationship during this time was less strained, with Jolie realizing that they were both "drama queens."&lt;ref name="Angelina Jolie Biography"/&gt;

Jolie began her professional film career in 1993, when she played her first leading role in the straight-to-video science-fiction sequel ''[[Cyborg 2]]'', as a near-human robot designed for corporate espionage and assassination.

''[[The New York Times]]'' critic [[Janet Maslin]] wrote, "Kate stands out. That's because she scowls even more sourly than [her co-stars] and is that rare female hacker who sits intently at her keyboard in a see-through top."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Maslin | first=Janet | url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=990CE2D61631F936A2575AC0A963958260 | title=Those Wacky Teenagers and Their Crazy Fads | newspaper=The New York Times | date=September 15, 1995 | accessdate=December 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Hackers'' failed to make a profit at the box office, but developed a cult following after its video release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | last=Brandt | first=Andrew | url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/TECH/internet/04/05/hacking.hollywood.idg/index.html?related | title=How Hollywood portrays hackers | magazine=PC World | date=May 4, 2001 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060510124043/http://archives.cnn.com/2001/TECH/internet/04/05/hacking.hollywood.idg/index.html?related | archivedate=May 10, 2006 | deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After starring in the modern-day ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' adaptation ''[[Love Is All There Is]]'' (1996), Jolie appeared in the road movie ''[[Mojave Moon]]'' (1996), of which ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' said, "Jolie, an actress whom the camera truly adores, reveals a comic flair and the kind of blatant sexuality that makes it entirely credible that [[Danny Aiello]]'s character would drop everything just for the chance of being with her."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | url=https://www.imdb.com/news/ni0184646/ | title=Film review: 'Mojave Moon' | magazine=The Hollywood Reporter | date=November 24, 1996 | accessdate=December 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Foxfire (1996 film)|Foxfire]]'' (1996) she played a drifter who unites four teenage girls against a teacher who has sexually harassed them. Jack Mathews of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote of her performance, "It took a lot of hogwash to develop this character, but Jolie, Jon Voight's knockout daughter, has the presence to overcome the stereotype. Though the story is narrated by Maddy, Legs is the subject and the catalyst."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Mathews | first=Jack | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-08-23/entertainment/ca-36764_1_drifter | title=Rebellion in 'Foxfire' Loses Impact in Leap to the '90s | newspaper=Los Angeles Times | date=August 23, 1996 | accessdate=December 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, Jolie starred with [[David Duchovny]] in the thriller ''[[Playing God (1997 film)|Playing God]]'', set in the Los Angeles underworld. The film was not well received by critics; ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' critic [[Roger Ebert]] noted that Jolie "finds a certain warmth in a kind of role that is usually hard and aggressive; she seems too nice to be [a mobster's] girlfriend, and maybe she is."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Ebert | first=Roger | url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19971017/REVIEWS/710170306/1023 | title=Reviews: Playing God | newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times | date=October 17, 1997 | accessdate=December 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her next work, as a frontierswoman in the [[CBS]] miniseries ''[[True Women]]'' (1997), was even less successful; writing for ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'', Robert Strauss dismissed her as "horrid, a fourth-rate [[Scarlett O'Hara]]" who relies on "gnashed teeth and overly pouted lips."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Strauss | first=Robert | url=http://articles.philly.com/1997-05-16/entertainment/25564646_1_janice-woods-windle-true-women-annabeth-gish | newspaper=The Philadelphia Inquirer | title='True Women' Cooks Up a Tale of Suffering With No Nutritional Value | date=May 16, 1997 | accessdate=January 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jolie also starred in the music video for the [[Rolling Stones]]'s "[[Anybody Seen My Baby?]]" as a stripper who leaves mid-performance to wander New York City.&lt;ref&gt;Childers, Chad (11 July 2013).

===1998–2000: Breakthrough===
Jolie's career prospects began to improve after she won a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Series, Miniseries or Television Film|Golden Globe Award]] for her performance in [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]]'s ''[[George Wallace (film)|George Wallace]]'' (1997), about the life of the segregationist Alabama Governor and presidential candidate [[George Wallace]], played by [[Gary Sinise]]. Jolie portrayed Wallace's second wife, [[Cornelia Wallace|Cornelia]], a performance Lee Winfrey of ''The Philadelphia Inquirer'' considered a highlight of the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Winfrey | first=Lee | url=http://articles.philly.com/1997-08-24/entertainment/25569021_1_george-wallace-arthur-bremer-alabama-gov | title= A Story Of Civil Wrongs And Eventual Repentance | newspaper=The Philadelphia Inquirer | date=August 24, 1997 | accessdate=January 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''George Wallace'' was very well received by critics and won, among other awards, the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Miniseries or Television Film]]. Jolie also received a nomination for an [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Miniseries or a Movie|Emmy Award]] for her performance.

Jolie's first breakthrough came when she portrayed supermodel [[Gia Carangi]] in [[HBO]]'s ''[[Gia]]'' (1998). The film chronicles the destruction of Carangi's life and career as a result of her addiction to heroin, and her decline and death from AIDS in the mid-1980s. Vanessa Vance of Reel.com retrospectively noted, "Jolie gained wide recognition for her role as the titular Gia, and it's easy to see why. Jolie is fierce in her portrayal—filling the part with nerve, charm, and desperation—and her role in this film is quite possibly the most beautiful train wreck ever filmed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vance |first=Vanessa |url=http://www.reel.com/movie.asp?MID=42045&amp;PID=10086013&amp;Tab=reviews&amp;CID=18 |title=Gia (1998) |publisher=Reel.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090611143609/http://www.reel.com/movie.asp?MID=42045&amp;PID=10086013&amp;Tab=reviews&amp;CID=18 |archivedate=June 11, 2009 |deadurl=unfit }}&lt;/ref&gt; For the second consecutive year, Jolie won a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Miniseries or Television Film|Golden Globe Award]] and was nominated for an [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries or a Movie|Emmy Award]]. She also won her first [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Miniseries or Television Movie|Screen Actors Guild Award]].

In accordance with [[Lee Strasberg]]'s [[method acting]], Jolie preferred to stay in character in between scenes during many of her early films, and as a result had gained a reputation for being difficult to deal with. While shooting ''Gia'', she told her husband, [[Jonny Lee Miller]], that she would not be able to phone him: "I'd tell him: 'I'm alone; I'm dying; I'm gay; I'm not going to see you for weeks.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | url=http://angelanna3.tripod.com/interviews2000/id12.html | title=Star Light, Star Bright – Hollywood's shining starlets | magazine=Pavement | date=February–March 2000 | accessdate=December 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After ''Gia'' [[wrap (filmmaking)|wrapped]], she briefly gave up acting, because she felt that she had "nothing else to give."&lt;ref name="Blood, Sugar, Sex, Magic"/&gt; She separated from Miller and moved to New York, where she took night classes at [[New York University]] to study directing and screenwriting.&lt;ref name="Angelina Jolie: Body Beautiful"/&gt; Encouraged by her Golden Globe Award win for ''George Wallace'' and the positive critical reception of ''Gia'', Jolie resumed her career.&lt;ref name="Blood, Sugar, Sex, Magic"/&gt;

Following the previously filmed gangster film ''[[Hell's Kitchen (1998 film)|Hell's Kitchen]]'' (1998), Jolie returned to the screen in ''[[Playing by Heart]]'' (1998), part of an ensemble cast that included [[Sean Connery]], [[Gillian Anderson]], and [[Ryan Phillippe]]. The film received predominantly positive reviews, and Jolie was praised in particular; ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' critic Peter Stack wrote, "Jolie, working through an overwritten part, is a sensation as the desperate club crawler learning truths about what she's willing to gamble."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Stack | first=Peter | url= http://www.sfgate.com/movies/article/Heart-Barely-Misses-a-Beat-Small-life-stories-2951376.php | title='Heart' Barely Misses a Beat | newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle | date=January 22, 1999 | accessdate=December 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She won the Breakthrough Performance Award from the [[National Board of Review]].

In 1999, Jolie starred in the comedy-drama ''[[Pushing Tin]]'', alongside [[John Cusack]], [[Billy Bob Thornton]], and [[Cate Blanchett]]. The film met with mixed reception from critics, and Jolie's character—Thornton's seductive wife—was particularly criticized; writing for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', [[Desson Howe]] dismissed her as "a completely ludicrous writer's creation of a free-spirited woman who weeps over hibiscus plants that die, wears lots of turquoise rings and gets real lonely when Russell spends entire nights away from home."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Howe | first=Desson | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/movies/reviews/pushingtinhowe.htm | title='Pushing Tin': A Bumpy Ride | newspaper=The Washington Post | date=April 23, 1999 | accessdate=December 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jolie then co-starred with [[Denzel Washington]] in ''[[The Bone Collector]]'' (1999), playing a police officer who reluctantly helps Washington's [[paraplegic]] detective track down a serial killer. The film grossed $151.5 million worldwide,&lt;ref name="Angelina Jolie Movie Box Office Results"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/people/chart/?view=Actor&amp;id=angelinajolie.htm |publisher=Box Office Mojo |title=Angelina Jolie Movie Box Office Results (Actor)|accessdate=December 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was critically unsuccessful. Terry Lawson of the ''[[Detroit Free Press]]'' concluded, "Jolie, while always delicious to look at, is simply and woefully miscast."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Lawson | first=Terry | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/bone_collector/reviews/?type=top_critics | title=The Bone Collector | newspaper=Detroit Free Press | date=January 1, 2000 | accessdate=December 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jolie next took the supporting role of a [[antisocial personality disorder|sociopathic]] mental patient in ''[[Girl, Interrupted (film)|Girl, Interrupted]]'' (1999), an adaptation of [[Susanna Kaysen]]'s [[Girl, Interrupted|memoir of the same name]]. While [[Winona Ryder]] played the main character in what was hoped to be a comeback for her, the film instead marked Jolie's final breakthrough in Hollywood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= https://www.imdb.com/MotDArchive/2003/motd.20030307 | title=IMDb Movie of the Day | publisher=IMDb | date=March 7, 2003 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20031222154652/http://www.imdb.com/MotDArchive/2003/motd.20030307 |archivedate=December 22, 2003 | deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; She won her third [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Motion Picture|Golden Globe Award]], her second [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role|Screen Actors Guild Award]], and an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]]. For ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', [[Emanuel Levy]] noted, "Jolie is excellent as the flamboyant, irresponsible girl who turns out to be far more instrumental than the doctors in Susanna's rehabilitation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | last=Levy | first=Emanuel | url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117759846?refcatid=31 | title=Reviews: Girl, Interrupted | magazine=Variety | date=December 9, 1999 | accessdate=December 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Jolie appeared in her first summer blockbuster, ''[[Gone in 60 Seconds (2000 film)|Gone in 60 Seconds]]'', which became her highest-grossing film to that point, earning $237.2 million internationally.&lt;ref name="Angelina Jolie Movie Box Office Results"/&gt; She had a minor role as the mechanic ex-girlfriend of a car thief played by [[Nicolas Cage]]; ''The Washington Post'' writer [[Stephen Hunter]] criticized that "all she does in this movie is stand around, cooling down, modeling those fleshy, pulsating muscle-tubes that nest so provocatively around her teeth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Hunter | first=Stephen | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/entertainment/movies/reviews/gonein60secondshunter.htm | title='Gone in 60 Seconds': Lost in the Exhaust | newspaper=The Washington Post | date=June 9, 2000 | accessdate=December 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jolie later explained that the film had been a welcome relief after her emotionally demanding role in ''Girl, Interrupted''.

===2001–2004: Mainstream recognition===
Although highly regarded for her acting abilities, Jolie had rarely found films that appealed to a wide audience, but ''Lara Croft: Tomb Raider'' (2001) made her an international superstar. An adaptation of the popular ''[[Tomb Raider]]'' videogames, the film required her to learn an English accent and undergo extensive martial arts training to play the archaeologist-adventurer [[Lara Croft]]. Although the film generated mostly negative reviews, Jolie was generally praised for her physical performance; ''[[Newsday]]''{{'}}s John Anderson commented, "Jolie makes the title character a virtual icon of female competence and coolth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Anderson | first=John | url=http://www.newsday.com/content/movies/nd9040.htm | newspaper=Newsday | title=It's No Game: She's a Woman of Action | date=June 15, 2001 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010625111019/http://www.newsday.com/content/movies/nd9040.htm |archivedate=June 25, 2001 | deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was an international hit, earning $274.7 million worldwide,&lt;ref name="Angelina Jolie Movie Box Office Results"/&gt; and launched her global reputation as a female action star.

[[File:Angelina Jolie.jpg|thumb|upright|Jolie at the Cologne premiere of ''[[Alexander (2004 film)|Alexander]]'' in December 2004]]

Jolie next starred opposite [[Antonio Banderas]] as his mail-order bride in ''[[Original Sin (2001 film)|Original Sin]]'' (2001), the first of a string of films that were poorly received by critics and audiences alike. ''The New York Times'' critic [[Elvis Mitchell]] questioned Jolie's decision to follow her Oscar-winning performance with "soft-core nonsense."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Mitchell | first=Elvis | url= https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C0CE1D9143CF930A3575BC0A9679C8B63 | title=Original Sin: The Item You Ordered May Be Sneaky | newspaper=The New York Times | date=August 3, 2001 | accessdate=December 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The romantic comedy ''[[Life or Something Like It]]'' (2002), though equally unsuccessful, marked an unusual choice for Jolie. ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]''{{'}}s [[Allen Barra]] considered her ambitious newscaster character a rare attempt at playing a conventional women's role, noting that her performance "doesn't get off the ground until a scene where she goes punk and leads a group of striking bus workers in singing '[[(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction|Satisfaction]]'".&lt;ref name="Salon"&gt;{{cite web | last=Barra | first=Allen | url=http://www.salon.com/2005/06/11/angelina_jolie/ | website=Salon | title= Angelina Jolie's Hollywood exile | date=June 11, 2005 | accessdate=January 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite her lack of box office success, Jolie remained in demand as an actress;&lt;ref name="Learning To Fly"/&gt; in 2002, she established herself among Hollywood's highest-paid actresses, earning $10–$15 million per film for the next five years.&lt;ref name="highest paid actresses"&gt;{{cite magazine | url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Nicole+Kidman+Tops+The+Hollywood+Reporter%27s+Annual+Actress+Salary...-a0155216809 | title=Nicole Kidman Tops The Hollywood Reporter's Annual Actress Salary List | magazine=The Hollywood Reporter | date=November 30, 2006 | accessdate=December 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jolie reprised her role as Lara Croft in ''[[Lara Croft: Tomb Raider – The Cradle of Life]]'' (2003), which was not as lucrative as the original, earning $156.5 million at the international box office.&lt;ref name="Angelina Jolie Movie Box Office Results"/&gt; She also starred in the music video for [[Korn]]'s "[[Did My Time]]", which was used to promote the sequel. Her next film was ''[[Beyond Borders (film)|Beyond Borders]]'' (2003), in which she portrayed a socialite who joins an aid worker played by [[Clive Owen]]. Though unsuccessful with audiences, the film stands as the first of several passion projects Jolie has made to bring attention to humanitarian causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last=Sims | first=David | url=https://news.yahoo.com/angelina-jolie-struggled-beyond-borders-first-many-passion-214300789.html | title=Angelina Jolie Struggled With 'Beyond Borders,' the First of Many Passion Projects | magazine=The Atlantic | date=May 29, 2014 | accessdate=January 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Beyond Borders'' was a critical failure; [[Kenneth Turan]] of the ''Los Angeles Times'' acknowledged Jolie's ability to "bring electricity and believability to roles," but wrote that "the limbo of a hybrid character, a badly written cardboard person in a fly-infested, blood-and-guts world, completely defeats her."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Turan | first=Kenneth | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/oct/24/entertainment/et-borders24 | title=No getting beyond borderline silliness | newspaper=Los Angeles Times | date=October 24, 2003 | accessdate=December 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The year 2004 saw the release of four films featuring Jolie. She first starred in the thriller ''[[Taking Lives]]'' as an FBI profiler summoned to help Montreal law enforcement hunt down a serial killer. The film received mixed reviews; ''The Hollywood Reporter'' critic Kirk Honeycutt concluded, "Jolie plays a role that definitely feels like something she has already done, but she does add an unmistakable dash of excitement and glamour."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | last=Honeycutt | first=Kirk | url= http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000462115 | title=Taking Lives | magazine=The Hollywood Reporter | date=March 15, 2004 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071011080057/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000462115 | archivedate=October 11, 2007 | deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jolie made a brief appearance as a fighter pilot in ''[[Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow]]'', a science fiction adventure shot entirely with actors in front of a [[Chroma key|bluescreen]], and voiced her first family film, the [[DreamWorks]] animation ''[[Shark Tale]]''. Her supporting role as Queen [[Olympias]] in [[Oliver Stone]]'s ''[[Alexander (2004 film)|Alexander]]'', about the life of [[Alexander the Great]], was met with mixed reception, particularly concerning her Slavic accent.&lt;ref name="Salon"/&gt; Commercially, the film failed in North America, which Stone attributed to disapproval of the depiction of Alexander's bisexuality,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2005/jan/06/news1 | title=Stone blames 'moral fundamentalism' for US box office flop | newspaper=The Guardian | date=January 6, 2005 | accessdate=December 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it succeeded internationally, for a total revenue of $167.3 million.&lt;ref name="Angelina Jolie Movie Box Office Results"/&gt;

===2005–2010: Commercial success===
In 2005, Jolie returned to major box office success with the action-comedy ''[[Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith (2005 film)|Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith]]'', in which she starred opposite [[Brad Pitt]] as a bored married couple who find out that they are both secret assassins. The film received mixed reviews, but was generally lauded for the chemistry between the two leads; ''[[Star Tribune]]'' critic Colin Covert noted, "While the story feels haphazard, the movie gets by on gregarious charm, galloping energy and the stars' thermonuclear screen chemistry."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Covert |first=Colin | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mr_and_mrs_smith/reviews/?type=top_critics |title=Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith | newspaper=Minneapolis Star Tribune | date=June 9, 2005 | accessdate=December 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; With box office takings of $478.2 million worldwide, ''Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith'' was the seventh-highest grossing picture of the year and remained Jolie's highest-grossing live-action film for the next decade.&lt;ref name="Angelina Jolie Movie Box Office Results"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?view2=worldwide&amp;yr=2005&amp;p=.htm | title=2005 Worldwide Grosses | publisher=Box Office Mojo | accessdate=December 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a supporting role as the neglected wife of a CIA officer in [[Robert De Niro]]'s ''[[The Good Shepherd (film)|The Good Shepherd]]'' (2006), Jolie starred as [[Mariane Pearl]] in the documentary-style drama ''[[A Mighty Heart (film)|A Mighty Heart]]'' (2007).

As Jolie preferred to dedicate herself to her humanitarian work, her cinematic output remained infrequent. ''[[First They Killed My Father (film)|First They Killed My Father]]'' (2017), a drama set during Cambodia's [[Khmer Rouge]] era, again enabled her to combine both interests.

On April 17, 2012, after more than a decade of service as a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador, Jolie was promoted to the rank of [[Special Envoy]] to High Commissioner [[António Guterres]], the first to take on such a position within the organization.

===Conservation and community development===
[[File:Angelina Jolie at Davos.jpg|thumb|upright|Jolie at the [[World Economic Forum]]'s annual meeting in January 2005]]

In an effort to connect her Cambodian-born son with his heritage, Jolie purchased a house in his country of birth in 2003. The traditional home sat on 39 hectares in the northwestern province [[Battambang Province|Battambang]], adjacent to [[Samlaut Multiple Use Area|Samlout national park]] in the [[Cardamom mountains]], which had become infiltrated with poachers who threatened endangered species. She purchased the park's 60,000 hectares and turned the area into a wildlife reserve named for her son, the Maddox Jolie Project.&lt;ref name="Esquire07"&gt;{{cite magazine | last=Junod | first=Tom | url=http://www.esquire.com/women/women-we-love/angelina-jolie-interview-pics-0707 | title=Angelina Jolie Dies for Our Sins | magazine=Esquire | date=July 2007 | accessdate=December 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recognition of her conservation efforts, King [[Norodom Sihamoni]] awarded her Cambodian citizenship on July 31, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4144518.stm | title=Jolie given Cambodian citizenship | publisher=BBC News | date=August 12, 2005 | accessdate=December 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2006, Jolie expanded the scope of the project—renamed the Maddox Jolie-Pitt Foundation (MJP)—to create Asia's first [[Millennium Villages Project|Millennium Village]], in accordance with [[Millennium Development Goals|UN development goals]].&lt;ref name="Help Cambodia"&gt;{{cite magazine | last=Green | first=Mary | url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20005434,00.html | title=Brad and Angelina's New Year's Resolution: Help Cambodia | magazine=People | date=December 27, 2006 | accessdate=December 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was inspired by a meeting with the founder of [[Millennium Promise]], noted economist [[Jeffrey Sachs]], at the [[World Economic Forum]] in [[Davos]],&lt;ref name="Esquire07"/&gt; where she was an invited speaker in 2005 and 2006. Together they filmed a 2005 MTV special, ''The Diary of Angelina Jolie &amp; Dr. Jeffrey Sachs in Africa'', which followed them on a trip to a Millennium Village in western Kenya. By mid-2007, some 6,000 villagers and 72 employees—some of them former poachers employed as rangers—lived and worked at MJP, in ten villages previously isolated from one another. The compound includes schools, roads, and a soy milk factory, all funded by Jolie. Her home functions as the MJP field headquarters.&lt;ref name="Esquire07"/&gt;

After filming ''Beyond Borders'' (2003) in Namibia, Jolie became patron of the [[Harnas Wildlife Foundation]], a wildlife orphanage and medical center in the [[Kalahari desert]]. She first visited the Harnas farm during production of the film, which features vultures rescued by the foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | newspaper=International Herald Tribune|agency=Associated Press | title= Namibian family turn farm into animal sanctuary | url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/11/23/africa/AF_FEA_TRV_Namibia_Wildlife_Sanctuary.php | date=November 22, 2006 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061123071338/http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/11/23/africa/AF_FEA_TRV_Namibia_Wildlife_Sanctuary.php | archivedate=November 23, 2006 | deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2010, Jolie and her partner, Brad Pitt, established the Shiloh Jolie-Pitt Foundation to support conservation work by the [[Naankuse Wildlife Sanctuary]], a nature reserve also located in the Kalahari.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Shiloh Jolie-Pitt Foundation| url= http://www.naankuse.com/jolie-pitt-foundation.html | publisher=Naankuse Foundation | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110314192059/http://www.naankuse.com/jolie-pitt-foundation.html | archivedate=March 14, 2011 | deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In name of their Namibian-born daughter, they have funded large-animal conservation projects as well as a free health clinic, housing, and a school for the [[San people|San Bushmen]] community at Naankuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last= D'Zurilla | first=Christie | newspaper=Los Angeles Times | title= Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt donate $2 million to African wildlife sanctuary | url= http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/gossip/2011/01/angelina-jolie-brad-pitt-donate-2-million-to-african-wildlife-sanctuary.html | date=January 3, 2011 | accessdate=January 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/entertainment/celebrity/2015/01/06/jolie-and-pitt-donate-enclosure-for-endangered-cheetah | title=Jolie and Pitt donate enclosure for endangered cheetah | newspaper=The Times | location=South Africa | date=January 6, 2015 | accessdate=January 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.naankuselodge.com/supporters-partners.html | title=Supporters and Partners | publisher=Naankuse Foundation | accessdate=January 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jolie and Pitt support other causes through the Jolie-Pitt Foundation, established in September 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Green |first=Mary |url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,26334,1537302,00.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070307112930/http://www.people.com/people/article/0%2C26334%2C1537302%2C00.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=March 7, 2007 |title=Brad and Angelina Start Charitable Group |magazine=People |date=September 20, 2006 |accessdate=January 7, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jolie has fronted a campaign against [[war rape|sexual violence in military conflict zones]] by the UK government, which made the issue a priority of its [[39th G8 summit|2013 G8 presidency]].

==Personal life==

===Relationships and marriages===
Jolie had a serious boyfriend for two years from the age of 14. Her mother allowed them to live together in her home, of which Jolie later said, "I was either going to be reckless on the streets with my boyfriend or he was going to be with me in my bedroom with my mom in the next room. She made the choice, and because of it, I continued to go to school every morning and explored my first relationship in a safe way."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | last=Kasle Furmaniak | first=Jennifer | url= http://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/news/a1570/angelina-jolie-03/ | title=Angelina Holds Nothing Back | magazine=Cosmopolitan | date=August 2003 | accessdate=January 9, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She has compared the relationship to a marriage in its emotional intensity, and said that the breakup compelled her to dedicate herself to her acting career at the age of 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Hobson | first=Louis B. | url=http://www.jonnyleemiller.co.uk/angelinajolie.html | title=Jolie's rocky relationships | newspaper=Calgary Sun | year=2000 | accessdate=January 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During filming of ''Hackers'' (1995), Jolie had a romance with British actor Jonny Lee Miller, her first lover since the relationship in her early teens.&lt;ref name="Blood, Sugar, Sex, Magic"/&gt; They were not in touch for many months after production ended, but eventually reconnected and married soon after in March 1996. She attended her wedding in black rubber pants and a white T-shirt, upon which she had written the groom's name in her blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Bandon | first=Alexandra | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C07E7DF1230F936A1575BC0A960958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all | title=Following, Ambivalently, in Mom or Dad's Footsteps | newspaper=The New York Times | date=August 25, 1996 | accessdate=January 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the relationship ended for good the following year, Jolie remained on good terms with Miller, whom she called "a solid man and a solid friend".&lt;ref name="And Baby Makes Two"/&gt; Their divorce, initiated by Jolie in February 1999, was finalized shortly before she remarried the next year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20127629,00.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150919231918/http://www.people.com/people/article/0%2C%2C20127629%2C00.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=September 19, 2015 |title=Passages |first=David Cobb |last=Craig |work=People |date=February 22, 1999 |accessdate=September 20, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Early to Wed"&gt;{{cite magazine | last=Dam | first=Julie K.L. | url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20131307,00.html | title=Early to Wed | magazine=People | date=May 22, 2000 | accessdate=January 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to her marriage to Miller, Jolie began a relationship with model-actress [[Jenny Shimizu]] on the set of ''Foxfire'' (1996). She later said, "I would probably have married Jenny if I hadn't married my husband. I fell in love with her the first second I saw her."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | url=http://angelanna3.tripod.com/interviews/id4.html | title=Tis the Season to Be Jolie | magazine=Girlfriends | date=December 1997 | accessdate=January 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Shimizu, their relationship lasted several years and continued even while Jolie was romantically involved with other people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Czyzselska |first=Jane |url=http://www.divamag.co.uk/category/arts-entertainment/jenny-shimizu-rebecca-loos-what%27s-the-story.aspx |title=Jenny Shimizu and Rebecca Loos: what's the story? |magazine=Diva |date=November 2005 |accessdate=January 9, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150109065919/http://www.divamag.co.uk/category/arts-entertainment/jenny-shimizu-rebecca-loos-what%27s-the-story.aspx |archivedate=January 9, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, when asked if she was bisexual, Jolie responded, "Of course.

Yes!"&lt;ref name="Angelina, saint vs. sinner"&gt;{{cite news | last=Kesner | first=Julian |last2=Megna | first2=Michelle | url= http://www.nydailynews.com/front/story/387860p-329048c.html | title=Angelina, saint vs. sinner | newspaper=Daily News | location=New York | date=February 2, 2006 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060207100110/http://www.nydailynews.com/front/story/387860p-329048c.html | archivedate=February 7, 2006 | deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a two-month courtship, Jolie married actor Billy Bob Thornton on May 5, 2000, in Las Vegas. They had met on the set of ''Pushing Tin'' (1999), but did not pursue a relationship at that time as Thornton was engaged to actress [[Laura Dern]], while Jolie was reportedly dating actor [[Timothy Hutton]], her co-star in ''Playing God'' (1997).&lt;ref name="Early to Wed"/&gt; As a result of their frequent public declarations of passion and gestures of love—most famously wearing one another's blood in vials around their necks—their marriage became a favorite topic of the entertainment media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.imdb.com/news/ni0056657/ | title=Thornton Still Has Angelina Blood Locket | publisher=WENN | date=April 21, 2004 | accessdate=January 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jolie and Thornton announced the adoption of a child from Cambodia in March 2002, but abruptly separated three months later.&lt;ref name="Marriage, Interrupted"&gt;{{cite magazine | last=Smolowee | first=Jill | url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20137667,00.html | title=Marriage, Interrupted | magazine=People | date=August 5, 2002 | accessdate=January 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their divorce was finalized on May 27, 2003. When asked about the sudden dissolution of their marriage, Jolie stated, "It took me by surprise, too, because overnight, we totally changed. I think one day we had just nothing in common. And it's scary but&amp;nbsp;... I think it can happen when you get involved and you don't know yourself yet."&lt;ref name="Learning To Fly"/&gt;

Jolie was involved in a well-publicized Hollywood scandal when she was accused of having caused the 2005 divorce of actors [[Brad Pitt]] and [[Jennifer Aniston]]. She had fallen in love with Pitt during filming of ''Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith'' (2005), but dismissed allegations of an affair,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Harris | first=Mark | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/19/movies/19harr.html?_r=2&amp;pagewanted=all | title=The Mommy Track | newspaper=The New York Times | date=October 15, 2008 | accessdate=January 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; saying, "To be intimate with a married man, when my own father cheated on my mother, is not something I could forgive. I could not look at myself in the morning if I did that. I wouldn't be attracted to a man who would cheat on his wife."&lt;ref name="Angelina, saint vs. sinner"/&gt; Jolie and Pitt did not publicly comment on the nature of their relationship until January 2006, when she confirmed that she was pregnant with his child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,1145171,00.html | title=Angelina Jolie Pregnant | magazine=People | date=January 11, 2006 | accessdate=January 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cancer prevention treatment===
On February 16, 2013, at age 37, Jolie underwent a [[preventive double mastectomy]] after learning she had an 87% risk of developing breast cancer due to a defective [[BRCA1]] gene.&lt;ref name="My Medical Choice"&gt;{{cite news|last=Jolie|first=Angelina|title=My Medical Choice|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/14/opinion/my-medical-choice.html| newspaper=The New York Times|date=May 14, 2013 | accessdate=January 13, 2015|}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her maternal family history warranted genetic testing for [[BRCA mutation]]s: her mother, actress Marcheline Bertrand, had breast cancer and died from [[ovarian cancer]], while her grandmother died from ovarian cancer.&lt;ref name="A Patient's Journey"&gt;{{cite web|last=Funk|first=Kristi|title=A Patient's Journey: Angelina Jolie|url=http://www.pinklotusbreastcenter.com/breast-cancer-101/2013/05/a-patients-journey-angelina-jolie/|publisher=Pink Lotus Breast Center|date=May 14, 2013|accessdate=January 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Diary of a Surgery"&gt;{{cite news|last=Jolie Pitt|first=Angelina|title=Angelina Jolie Pitt: Diary of a Surgery|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/24/opinion/angelina-jolie-pitt-diary-of-a-surgery.html| newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 24, 2015 | accessdate=March 24, 2015|}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her aunt, who had the same BRCA1 defect, died from breast cancer three months after Jolie's operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Angelina Jolie's aunt dies of breast cancer|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/may/27/angelina-jolie-aunt-breast-cancer|newspaper=The Guardian|agency=Associated Press|date=May 27, 2013 |accessdate=January 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the mastectomy, which lowered her chances of developing breast cancer to under 5 percent, Jolie had reconstructive surgery involving implants and [[allografts]].&lt;ref name="A Patient's Journey"/&gt; Two years later, in March 2015, after annual test results indicated possible signs of early ovarian cancer, she underwent a preventive [[oophorectomy]], as she had a 50% risk of developing ovarian cancer due to the same genetic anomaly.

After completing each operation, Jolie discussed her mastectomy and oophorectomy in [[op-ed]]s published by ''The New York Times'', with the aim of helping other women make informed health choices.

As the daughter of actor Jon Voight, Jolie appeared in the media from an early age.&lt;ref name="Hiltbrand July 23, 2003"/&gt; After embarking on her own career, she earned a reputation as a "wild child", which contributed to her early success in the late 1990s and early 2000s.&lt;ref name="Rebel without a pause"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Ressner |first=Jeffrey |title=Rebel without a pause |magazine=Time |date=January 24, 2000 |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,995905-2,00.html |accessdate=January 14, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070815090521/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C995905%2C00.html |archivedate=August 15, 2007 |deadurl=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Celebrity profiles routinely covered her fascination with blood and knives, experiences with drugs, and her sex life, particularly her bisexuality and interest in [[sadomasochism]].&lt;ref name="Rebel without a pause"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jane, February 2000"&gt;{{cite magazine | last=Colon | first=Suzan| magazine=Jane | title=What the hell is wrong with Angelina Jolie? | url=http://angelanna3.tripod.com/interviews2000/id3.html | date=February 2000 | accessdate=January 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, when asked about her outspokenness, she stated, "I say things that other people might go through.

Professionally, Jolie's status as a sex symbol has been considered both an asset and a hindrance. Some of her most commercially successful films, including ''Lara Croft: Tomb Raider'' (2001) and ''Beowulf'' (2007), overtly relied at least in part on her sex appeal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Seiler | first=Andy | last2=Snider | first2=Mike | url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/movies/2001-06-15-lara-croft.htm | newspaper=USA Today | title=Lara Croft's greatest leap | date=June 15, 2001 | accessdate=January 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vulture.com/2007/11/sure_beowulf_is_a_technologica.html | title=Yes, 'Beowulf' Is a Technological Marvel — But How Does Angelina Jolie Look Naked? | publisher=[[Vulture (website)|Vulture]] | date=November 16, 2007 | accessdate=January 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with ''Empire'' stating that her "pneumatic figure", "feline eyes", and "bee-stung lips" have greatly contributed to her appeal to cinema audiences.&lt;ref name="Empire sexiest"&gt;{{cite magazine | url= http://www.empireonline.com/100sexiest/default.asp?star=1 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120310214149/http://www.empireonline.com/100sexiest/default.asp?star=1 | dead-url= yes | archive-date= March 10, 2012 | title=Angelina Jolie 'Sexiest Movie Star Ever' | magazine=Empire | date=December 5, 2007 | accessdate=January 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, ''Salon'' writer Allen Barra agreed with critics who suggested that Jolie's "dark and intense sexuality" has limited her in the types of roles she can be cast in, rendering her unconvincing in many conventional women's roles,&lt;ref name="Salon"/&gt; while Clint Eastwood, who directed her Oscar-nominated performance in ''Changeling'' (2008), opined that having "the most beautiful face on the planet" sometimes harmed her dramatic credibility with audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.smh.com.au/news/entertainment/film/beautiful-face-hampers-jolie-eastwood/2008/10/06/1223145233452.html | newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|publisher=Australian Associated Press | title= Beautiful face hampers Jolie: Eastwood |date=October 6, 2008 | accessdate=January 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond her career, Jolie's appearance has been credited with influencing popular culture at large. In 2002, [[AfterEllen]] founder [[Sarah Warn]] observed that many women of all sexual orientations had publicly expressed their attraction to Jolie, which she considered a new development in American culture, adding that "there are many beautiful women in Hollywood, and few generate the same kind of overwhelming interest across genders and sexual orientations that she does".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Warn | first=Sarah | url=http://www.afterellen.com/people/4213-the-angelina-jolie-phenomenon | title=The Angelina Jolie Phenomenon | publisher=AfterEllen | date=July 1, 2002 | accessdate=January 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jolie's physical attributes became highly sought-after among western women seeking cosmetic surgery; by 2007, she was considered "the gold standard of beauty",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/beauty/jolie-good/2007/04/12/1175971251818.html | title=Everyone wants to look like Jolie | newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald |publisher=Australian Associated Press | date=April 12, 2007 | accessdate=January 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with her full lips remaining the most imitated celebrity feature well into the 2010s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Landman | first=Beth | url=https://nypost.com/2013/04/23/nycs-most-wanted-face/ | title=NYC's most wanted face | newspaper=New York Post | date=April 23, 2013 | accessdate=January 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Douglas | first=Joanna | url=https://www.yahoo.com/beauty/everyone-wants-angelina-jolies-lips-kim-109212427563.html | title= Everyone Wants Angelina Jolie's Lips, Kim Kardashian's Eyes, and Brad Pitt's Nose | publisher=Yahoo!
