'''Patty Wagstaff''' ([[n√©e]] Patricia Rosalie Kearns Combs; born 11 September 1951) is an American aviator and U.S. National Aerobatic Champion.

Wagstaff was introduced to aviation as a child; her father was a pilot for [[Japan Airlines]], and she moved to Japan when she was nine years old.  After graduating from high school in California, she moved to Australia for five years where she traveled up the west coast of Australia in a small single-engine boat with no radio.  After moving to Alaska in 1978, she worked for the Bristol Bay Native Association in Dillingham, Alaska where she started taking flying lessons and began her own career as a pilot. Her first flight in a small airplane in the Alaskan bush ended in a crash and that was when she decided to learn to fly.  Her first lesson was in a [[Cessna 185]].  After earning her single and multi-engine land, single engine sea and commercial and instrument ratings, she became a Certified Flight and Instrument Instructor.   Since then she has earned a commercial rotorcraft rating and has flown many types of aircraft.  She  holds type ratings in the TBM Avenger, T-28, L-39 and Tucano.  Her sister, Toni, is a pilot for [[United Airlines]].&lt;ref name=halloffame&gt;[http://www.icasfoundation.org/hall_fame/2006/wagstaff.htm Patty Wagstaff] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927091607/http://www.icasfoundation.org/hall_fame/2006/wagstaff.htm |date=2007-09-27 }}, International Council of Air Shows Foundation Hall of Fame, accessed April 4, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
