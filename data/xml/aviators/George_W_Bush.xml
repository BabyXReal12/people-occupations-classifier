The [[September 11 terrorist attacks]] occurred eight months into Bush's first term.

====Primary====
[[File:George W. Bush in Concord, New Hampshire signing papers for presidential run.jpg|thumb|George W. Bush in Concord, New Hampshire, signing to be a candidate for president]]
Incumbent Democratic president [[Bill Clinton]] was completing his second and final term, and the field for nomination for President of both parties was wide open. Bush was the Governor of Texas in June 1999 when he announced his candidacy for President of the United States. He entered a large field of hopefuls for the Republican Party presidential nomination that included [[John McCain]], [[Alan Keyes]], [[Steve Forbes]], [[Gary Bauer]], [[Orrin Hatch]], [[Elizabeth Dole]], [[Dan Quayle]], [[Pat Buchanan]], [[Lamar Alexander]], [[John Kasich]], and [[Bob Smith (American politician)|Bob Smith]].

Bush portrayed himself as a [[compassionate conservatism|compassionate conservative]], implying he was more centrist than other Republicans. He campaigned on a platform that included bringing integrity and honor back to the White House, increasing the size of the [[United States Armed Forces]], cutting taxes, improving education, and aiding minorities.&lt;ref name=msn/&gt; By early 2000, the race had centered on Bush and McCain.&lt;ref name=msn/&gt;

Bush won the [[Iowa caucuses]], and although he was heavily favored to win the [[New Hampshire primary]], he trailed McCain by 19&amp;nbsp;percent and lost that primary. Despite this, Bush regained momentum, and according to political observers, he effectively became the front runner after the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 2000|South Carolina primary]]—which according to ''[[The Boston Globe]]''—made history for his campaign's negativity. ''[[The New York Times]]'' described it as a [[smear campaign]].&lt;ref name=anatomy&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2004/03/21/the_anatomy_of_a_smear_campaign/ |title=The anatomy of a smear campaign |work=Boston Globe |last=Davis |first=Richard H. |date=March 21, 2004 |accessdate=June 23, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060515081611/http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2004/03/21/the_anatomy_of_a_smear_campaign/ |archivedate=May 15, 2006 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hook |first1=Janet |author2=Michael Finnegan |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/mar/17/nation/na-mccain17 |title=McCain loses some of his rebel edge |work=Los Angeles Times |date=March 17, 2007 |accessdate=June 23, 2009 |archivedate=May 15, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060515081611/http://articles.latimes.com/2007/mar/17/nation/na-mccain17 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/19/us/politics/19mccain.html |title=Confronting Ghosts of 2000 in South Carolina |work=The New York Times |date=October 19, 2007 |accessdate=April 14, 2013 |last=Steinhauer |first=Jennifer |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209070019/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/19/us/politics/19mccain.html |archivedate=December 9, 2008 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 25, 2000, Bush surprised some observers when he selected [[Dick Cheney]]—a former [[White House Chief of Staff]], [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]], and [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]]—to be his [[running mate]]. At the time, Cheney was serving as head of Bush's vice presidential search committee. Soon after at the [[2000 Republican National Convention]], Bush and Cheney were officially nominated by the Republican Party.

Bush continued to campaign across the country and touted his record as Governor of Texas.&lt;ref name=msn/&gt; During his campaign, Bush criticized his Democratic opponent, incumbent Vice President [[Al Gore]], over [[Gun law in the United States|gun control]] and taxation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=Sack, Kevin |author2=Toner, Robin |date=August 13, 2000 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/13/us/2000-campaign-record-congress-gore-selected-issues-ready-for-prime-time.html |title=The 2000 Campaign: The Record; In Congress, Gore Selected Issues Ready for Prime Time |work=The New York Times |accessdate=June 23, 2009 |archivedate=May 15, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060515081611/http://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/13/us/2000-campaign-record-congress-gore-selected-issues-ready-for-prime-time.html |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The closeness of the Florida outcome led to a [[United States presidential election in Florida, 2000|recount]].&lt;ref name="msn"/&gt; The initial recount also went to Bush, but the outcome was tied up in lower courts for a month until eventually reaching the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/00-949.ZPC.html George W.

The Bush campaign advertised across the U.S. against Democratic candidates, including Bush's emerging opponent, Massachusetts Senator [[John Kerry]]. Kerry and other Democrats attacked Bush on the [[Iraq War]], and accused him of failing to stimulate the economy and job growth. The Bush campaign portrayed Kerry as a staunch [[liberalism in the United States|liberal]] who would raise taxes and increase the size of government. The Bush campaign continuously criticized Kerry's seemingly contradictory statements on the war in Iraq,&lt;ref name=msn/&gt; and argued that Kerry lacked the decisiveness and vision necessary for success in the War on Terror.

In the election, Bush carried 31 of 50 states, receiving a total of 286 [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral votes]]. He won an absolute majority of the popular vote (50.7&amp;nbsp;percent to his opponent's 48.3&amp;nbsp;percent).&lt;ref name="16 years"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/nov/04/uselections2004.usa16 |title=And now... four more years |accessdate=September 1, 2008 |date=November 4, 2004 |work=The Guardian |location=London |first=Julian |last=Borger |archivedate=May 15, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060515081611/http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2004/nov/04/uselections2004.usa16 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bush's father George H.W. Bush was the previous president who won an absolute majority of the popular vote; he accomplished that feat in the 1988 election. Additionally, it was the first time since [[Herbert Hoover]]'s [[United States presidential election, 1928|election in 1928]] that a Republican president was elected alongside re-elected Republican majorities in both Houses of Congress.

This landmark education initiative passed with broad bipartisan support, including that of Senator [[Ted Kennedy]] of [[Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The New York Times |url=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/n/no_child_left_behind_act/index.html |date=March 16, 2010 |accessdate=September 26, 2010 |first=Sam |last=Dillon |title=No Child Left Behind Act |archivedate=October 6, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131006034714/http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/n/no_child_left_behind_act/index.html |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was signed into law by Bush in early 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2002/01/20020108-1.html |title=President Signs Landmark No Child Left Behind Education Bill |date=January 8, 2002 |publisher=The White House |accessdate=May 5, 2008 |archivedate=October 6, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131006034714/http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2002/01/20020108-1.html |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many contend that the initiative has been successful, as cited by the fact that students in the U.S. have performed significantly better on state reading and math tests since Bush signed "No Child Left Behind" into law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/05/AR2007060502684.html |title=Scores Up Since 'No Child' Was Signed |accessdate=May 30, 2008 |date=June 6, 2007 |work=The Washington Post |author=Paley, Amit R}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics argue that it is underfunded&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=W.

After being re-elected, Bush signed into law a [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] drug benefit program that, according to [[Jan Crawford]], resulted in "the greatest expansion in America's [[welfare state]] in forty years;" the bill's costs approached $7&amp;nbsp;trillion.&lt;ref&gt;Greenburg, Jan Crawford, Supreme Conflict: The Inside Story of the Struggle for Control of the United States Supreme Court, 2007, Penguin Books, p. 274&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Bush opposed and vetoed [[State Children's Health Insurance Program]] (SCHIP) legislation, which was added by the Democrats onto a war funding bill and passed by Congress. The SCHIP legislation would have significantly expanded federally funded health care benefits and plans to children of some low-income families from about six&amp;nbsp;million to ten&amp;nbsp;million children. It was to be funded by an increase in the cigarette tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=Michael Abramowitz |author2=Jonathan Weisman |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/03/AR2007100300116_pf.html |title=Bush Vetoes Health Measure |work=The Washington Post |date=October 4, 2007 |accessdate=October 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bush viewed the legislation as a move toward [[socialized health care]], and asserted that the program could benefit families making as much as $83,000 per year who did not need the help.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=October 4, 2007 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/04/washington/04bush.html |title=Bush Vetoes Child Health Bill Privately |work=The New York Times |accessdate=September 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Social services and Social Security====
Following Republican efforts to pass the [[Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act|Medicare Act of 2003]], Bush signed the bill, which included major changes to the [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] program by providing beneficiaries with some assistance in paying for prescription drugs, while relying on private insurance for the delivery of benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncpssm.org/pdf/PL108summary.pdf |title=Summary of Medicare Act of 2003 |accessdate=August 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The retired persons lobby group [[AARP]] worked with the Bush Administration on the program and gave their endorsement. Bush said the law, estimated to cost $400&amp;nbsp;billion over the first ten years, would give the elderly "better choices and more control over their health care".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=The White House |url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2003/12/20031208-2.html |title=President Signs Medicare Legislation |date=December 8, 2003 |accessdate=September 1, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131006034714/http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2003/12/20031208-2.html |archivedate=October 6, 2013 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:President George W. Bush discussing Social Security.jpg|thumb|left|President Bush discussing Social Security reform at the Lake Nona YMCA Family Center in Orlando, Florida, March 18, 2005]]
Bush began his second term by outlining a major initiative to "[[Social Security debate in the United States|reform]]" Social Security,&lt;ref name="ss-msnbc"&gt;{{cite news |author=Wolk, Martin |publisher=MSNBC |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6903273/ |title=Bush pushes his Social Security overhaul |accessdate=August 20, 2008 |date=February 16, 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021105550/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6903273/ |archivedate=October 21, 2012 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was facing record deficit projections beginning in 2005. Bush made it the centerpiece of his domestic agenda despite opposition from some in the U.S. Congress.&lt;ref name="ss-msnbc"/&gt; In his [[2005 State of the Union Address]], Bush discussed the potential impending bankruptcy of the program and outlined his new program, which included partial privatization of the system, personal Social Security accounts, and options to permit Americans to divert a portion of their Social Security tax ([[Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax|FICA]]) into secured investments.&lt;ref name="ss-msnbc"/&gt; Democrats opposed the proposal to partially privatize the system.&lt;ref name="ss-msnbc"/&gt;

Bush embarked on a 60-day national tour, campaigning for his initiative in media events known as "Conversations on Social Security", in an attempt to gain public support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |accessdate=September 1, 2008 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A28120-2005Mar11.html |title=Social Security: On With the Show |author1=Jim VandeHei |author2=Peter Baker |date=February 12, 2005 |newspaper=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, public support for the proposal declined&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=April 28, 2005 |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/f944a850-b830-11d9-bc7c-00000e2511c8,_i_rssPage=80fdaff6-cbe5-11d7-81c6-0820abe49a01.html |title=Bush shifts approach on Social Security reform |accessdate=September 9, 2007 |newspaper=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the House Republican leadership decided not to put Social Security reform on the priority list for the remainder of their 2005 legislative agenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://thehill.com/thehill/export/TheHill/News/Frontpage/060105/social.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051205090810/http://thehill.com/thehill/export/TheHill/News/Frontpage/060105/social.html |archivedate=December 5, 2005 |title=Social Security in Limbo |work=The Hill |date=June 1, 2005 |author=Patrick O'Connor |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal's legislative prospects were further diminished by the fall of 2005 political fallout from [[Hurricane Katrina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Hurricane dims Bush's hopes on Social Security |date=September 22, 2005 |last=Yeager |first=Holly |url=http://news.ft.com/cms/s/00d6ee20-2b9f-11da-995a-00000e2511c8.html |accessdate=September 9, 2007 |work=Financial Times |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050923024100/http://news.ft.com/cms/s/00d6ee20-2b9f-11da-995a-00000e2511c8.html |archivedate=September 23, 2005 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Democrats gained control of both houses of Congress as a result of the [[United States Senate elections, 2006|2006 midterm elections]], there was no prospect of further congressional action on the Bush proposal for the remainder of his term in office.

====Environmental policies====
{{Main|Domestic policy of the George W. Bush administration#Environment}}
Upon taking office in 2001, Bush stated his opposition to the [[Kyoto Protocol]], an amendment to the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] which seeks to impose mandatory targets for reducing [[greenhouse gas]] emissions, citing that the treaty exempted 80&amp;nbsp;percent of the world's population&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=March 13, 2001 |url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2001/03/20010314.html |title=Letter from the President to Senators Hagel, Helms, Craig, and Roberts |publisher=Office of the Press Secretary |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130507053351/http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2001/03/20010314.html |deadurl=yes |archivedate=May 7, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and would have cost tens of billions of dollars per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/kyoto/economic.htm |title=Summary of the Kyoto Report&amp;nbsp;– Assessment of Economic Impacts |publisher=Energy Information Administration |date=July 16, 2002 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110523060852/http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/kyoto/economic.htm |deadurl=yes |archivedate=May 23, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also cited that the Senate had voted 95–0 in 1997 on a resolution expressing its disapproval of the protocol.

In May 2001, Bush signed an [[executive order]] to create an interagency task force to streamline energy projects,&lt;ref name=eo13212&gt;Bush, George W.

In 2002, Bush announced the [[Clear Skies Act of 2003]],&lt;ref name="EXsummary"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2002/02/clearskies.html |title=Executive Summary&amp;nbsp;– The Clear Skies Initiative |publisher=The White House |date=February 14, 2002 |accessdate=September 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; which aimed at amending the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] to reduce air pollution through the use of [[emissions trading]] programs. Many experts argued that this legislation would have weakened the original legislation by allowing higher emission rates of pollutants than were previously legal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sierraclub.org/cleanair/clear_skies.asp |publisher=The [[Sierra Club]] |title=Clear Skies Proposal Weakens the Clean Air Act |accessdate=September 1, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917224422/http://www.sierraclub.org/cleanair/clear_skies.asp |archivedate=September 17, 2008 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The initiative was introduced to Congress, but failed to make it out of committee.

Later in 2006, Bush declared the [[Northwestern Hawaiian Islands]] a national monument, creating the largest [[marine reserve]] to date. The [[Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument]] comprises 84&amp;nbsp;million acres (340,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and is home to 7,000 species of fish, birds, and other marine animals, many of which are specific to only those islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13300363/ |title=Bush creates world's biggest ocean preserve |date=June 16, 2006 |publisher=MSNBC |accessdate=September 1, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108120830/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13300363/ |archivedate=November 8, 2012 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The move was hailed by conservationists for "its foresight and leadership in protecting this incredible area".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nature.org/initiatives/marine/press/press2489.html |title=The Nature Conservancy Applauds President Bush for Creating World's Largest Marine Conservation Area in Hawaii |date=June 16, 2006 |publisher=[[The Nature Conservancy]] |accessdate=September 1, 2008 |archivedate=November 28, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081128101124/http://www.nature.org/initiatives/marine/press/press2489.html |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his [[2006 State of the Union Address]], Bush declared, "America is addicted to oil" and announced his Advanced Energy Initiative to increase [[energy development]] research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=January 31, 2006 |accessdate=October 1, 2006 |url=http://legacy.c-span.org/Transcripts/SOTU-2006.aspx |title=President George W.

In his [[2007 State of the Union Address]], Bush renewed his pledge to work toward diminished reliance on foreign oil by reducing [[fossil fuel]] consumption and increasing [[alternative fuel]] production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2007/01/20070123-2.html |title=President Bush Delivers State of the Union Address |publisher=The White House |date=January 23, 2007 |accessdate=June 23, 2009 |archivedate=May 2, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502232627/http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2007/01/20070123-2.html |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Amid high gasoline prices in 2008, Bush lifted a ban on [[offshore drilling]].&lt;ref name="drilling-cnn"&gt;{{cite news |accessdate=August 3, 2008 |date=July 14, 2008 |url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/07/14/bush.offshore/ |title=Bush lifts executive ban on offshore oil drilling |publisher=CNN |archivedate=May 2, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502232627/http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/07/14/bush.offshore/ |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the move was largely symbolic because there was still a federal law banning offshore drilling. Bush said, "This means that the only thing standing between the American people and these vast oil reserves is action from the U.S. Congress."&lt;ref name="drilling-cnn"/&gt; Bush had said in June 2008, "In the long run, the solution is to reduce demand for oil by promoting alternative energy technologies. My administration has worked with Congress to invest in gas-saving technologies like advanced batteries and hydrogen [[fuel cell]]s... In the short run, the American economy will continue to rely largely on oil. And that means we need to increase supply, especially here at home. So my administration has repeatedly called on Congress to expand domestic oil production."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/06/20080618.html |title=President Bush Discusses Energy |date=June 18, 2008 |accessdate=August 3, 2008 |publisher=The White House |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502232627/http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/06/20080618.html |archivedate=May 2, 2013 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his [[2008 State of the Union Address]], Bush announced that the U.S. would commit $2&amp;nbsp;billion over the next three years to a new international fund to promote clean energy technologies and fight climate change, saying, "Along with contributions from other countries, this fund will increase and accelerate the deployment of all forms of cleaner, more efficient technologies in developing nations like India and China, and help leverage substantial private-sector capital by making clean energy projects more financially attractive." He also announced plans to reaffirm the United States' commitment to work with major economies, and, through the UN, to complete an international agreement that will slow, stop, and eventually reverse the growth of greenhouse gases; he stated, "This agreement will be effective only if it includes commitments by every major economy and gives none a free ride."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/stateoftheunion2008.htm |title=George W.

====Stem cell research and first veto====
Federal funding for medical research involving the creation or destruction of human embryos through the [[Department of Health and Human Services]] and the [[National Institutes of Health]] has been forbidden by law since the passage in 1995 of the [[Dickey-Wicker Amendment]] by Congress and the signature of President [[Bill Clinton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=September 1, 2008 |url=http://www.aaas.org/spp/cstc/briefs/stemcells/index.shtml |title=AAAS Policy Brief: Stem Cell Research |publisher=[[American Association for the Advancement of Science]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bush has said that he supports adult [[stem cell]] research and has supported federal legislation that finances adult stem cell research.

The issue had been debated for 13 years before it finally became law. The measure is designed to protect citizens without hindering genetic research.

According to the prosecutors, there was insufficient evidence to pursue prosecution for any criminal offense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/connecticut/articles/2010/07/21/doj_prosecutor_firing_was_politics_not_crime/ |title=DOJ: Prosecutor firing was politics, not crime |newspaper=Boston Globe |date=July 21, 2010 |accessdate=July 31, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100723130805/http://www.boston.com/news/local/connecticut/articles/2010/07/21/doj_prosecutor_firing_was_politics_not_crime/ |archivedate=July 23, 2010 |first1=Matt |last1=Apuzzo |first2=Pete |last2=Yost |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Purge of the Central Intelligence Agency====
Following the resignation of CIA director [[George Tenet]] in 2004, Bush nominated [[Porter Goss]] to head the agency. The White House ordered Goss to purge agency officers who were disloyal to the administration.&lt;ref name=salon&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.salon.com/2004/11/15/cia_13/ |title=Purging the disloyal at the CIA |newspaper=Salon.com |date=November 15, 2004 |accessdate=April 4, 2017 |first1=Geraldine |last1=Sealey}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Goss' appointment, many of the CIA's senior agents were fired or quit. The CIA has been accused of deliberately leaking classified information to undermine the 2004 election.&lt;ref name=wapo&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A45940-2005Jan3.html |title=Dubious Purge at the CIA |newspaper=Washington Post |date=January 4, 2005 |accessdate=April 4, 2017 |first1=Haviland |last1=Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2001, Bush visited [[Pope John Paul II]] at Castel Gandolfo.&lt;ref&gt;Decision Points Bush, George W. Random House 2010 page 116&lt;/ref&gt;
During his presidential campaign, Bush's [[Foreign policy of the United States|foreign policy]] platform included support for stronger economic and political relationship with [[Latin America]], especially [[Mexico]], and a reduction of involvement in "[[nation-building]]" and other small-scale military engagements. The administration pursued a [[national missile defense]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://fas.org/nuke/control/abmt/news/010501bush.html |title=President Bush Speech on Missile Defense |publisher=[[Federation of American Scientists]] |date=May 1, 2001 |accessdate=September 1, 2008 |archivedate=March 13, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080313022704/http://www.fas.org/nuke/control/abmt/news/010501bush.html |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bush was an advocate of China's entry into the [[World Trade Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/asiapcf/east/04/05/china.WTO/ |title=Bush backs China's WTO entry despite standoff |publisher=CNN |date=April 6, 2001 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515133508/http://edition.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/asiapcf/east/04/05/china.WTO/ |archivedate=May 15, 2011 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 2002 State of the Union Address, Bush referred to an [[axis of evil]] including [[Iraq]], [[Iran]] and [[North Korea]].&lt;ref name=suterror&gt;{{cite web |url=http://millercenter.org/president/speeches/detail/4540 |title=State of the Union Address (January 29, 2002)&amp;nbsp;– Miller Center |publisher=Millercenter.org |date=January 29, 2002 |accessdate=July 31, 2012 |author=P.O.

In 2003, Bush then launched the [[Iraq War|invasion of Iraq]], searching for Weapons of Mass Destruction, which he described as being part of the War on Terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=November 30, 2005 |accessdate=January 19, 2009 |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/11/30/bush.excerpts/index.html |title=Key points from Bush speech |publisher=CNN |archivedate=May 15, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515133532/http://edition.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/11/30/bush.excerpts/index.html |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Those invasions led to the toppling of the [[Taliban]] regime in Afghanistan and the removal of [[Saddam Hussein]] from power in Iraq.

[[File:Bush meets Pranab Mukherjee.jpg|thumb|left|Foreign Minister of India [[Pranab Mukherjee]] with President Bush, March 2008]]
Bush began his second term with an emphasis on improving strained relations with European nations. He appointed long-time adviser [[Karen Hughes]] to oversee a global public relations campaign. Bush lauded the pro-democracy struggles in Georgia and Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Freedom Agenda |url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/infocus/freedomagenda/ |website=georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov |publisher=georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov |accessdate=November 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2006, Bush reversed decades of U.S. policy when he visited India; the trip led to renewed ties between the two countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2006-03-02-nuclear-pact_x.htm |title=Nuclear deal announced as Bush visits India |newspaper=USA Today |date=March 2, 2006 |accessdate=March 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The visit focused particularly on areas of [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]], counter-terrorism cooperation, and discussions that would eventually lead to the [[India–United States Civil Nuclear Agreement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2006/03/20060302-5.html |title=U.S. –India Joint Statement |date=March 2, 2006 |publisher=The White House |accessdate=September 1, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090611161845/http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2006/03/20060302-5.html |archivedate=June 11, 2009 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bush's visit was in stark contrast to the stance taken by his predecessor, Bill Clinton, whose approach and response to India after the 1998 nuclear tests was that of sanctions and hectoring. The relationship between India and the United States was one that dramatically improved during Bush's tenure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1109/29825.html |title=Roemer key to U.S. –India relationship&amp;nbsp;– Daniel Libit and Laura Rozen |publisher=Politico.Com |accessdate=March 16, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091126182109/http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1109/29825.html |archivedate=November 26, 2009 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Midway through Bush's second term, questions arose whether Bush was retreating from his freedom and democracy agenda, which was highlighted in policy changes toward some oil-rich former Soviet republics in central Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/23/AR2006042301017.html |title=Retreat From the Freedom Agenda |accessdate=September 1, 2008 |last=Diehl |first=Jackson |date=April 24, 2005 |newspaper=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an address before both Houses of Congress on September 20, 2001, Bush thanked the nations of the world for their support following the September 11 attacks. He specifically thanked [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|UK Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]] for traveling to Washington to show "unity of purpose with America", and said "America has no truer friend than Great Britain."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2001/09/20010920-8.html |title=Address to a Joint Session of Congress and the American People |author=Bush, George W. |publisher=[[The White House]] |date=September 20, 2001 |accessdate=April 6, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090527194111/http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2001/09/20010920-8.html |archivedate=May 27, 2009 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The September 11 terrorist attacks were a major turning point in Bush's presidency. That evening, he addressed the nation from the [[Oval Office]], promising a strong response to the attacks. He also emphasized the need for the nation to come together and comfort the families of the victims. Three days after the attacks, Bush visited [[World Trade Center site|Ground Zero]] and met with Mayor [[Rudy Giuliani]], firefighters, police officers, and volunteers. To much applause, Bush addressed the gathering via a megaphone while standing in a heap of rubble: "I can hear you. The rest of the world hears you. And the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2001/09/20010914-9.html |date=September 14, 2001 |title=President Bush Salutes Heroes in New York |publisher=The White House |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225062850/http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2001/09/20010914-9.html |archivedate=February 25, 2008 |accessdate=June 23, 2009 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a September 20 speech, Bush condemned [[Osama bin Laden]] and his organization [[Al-Qaeda]], and issued an ultimatum to the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, where bin Laden was operating, to "hand over the terrorists, or ... share in their fate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2001/09/20010920-8.html |date=September 20, 2001 |title=Address to a Joint Session of Congress and the American People |publisher=The White House |accessdate=June 23, 2009 |archivedate=May 27, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090527194111/http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2001/09/20010920-8.html |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 7, 2001, U.S. and British forces initiated bombing campaigns that led to the arrival of [[Northern Alliance]] troops in [[Kabul]] on November 13. The main goals of the war were to defeat the [[Taliban]], drive [[al-Qaeda]] out of Afghanistan, and capture key al-Qaeda leaders. In December 2001, the Pentagon reported that the Taliban had been defeated,&lt;ref name=taliband&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/11/world/nation-challenged-military-campaign-taliban-defeated-pentagon-asserts-but-war.html |accessdate=June 23, 2009 |date=December 11, 2001 |author1=Shanker, Tom |author2=Eric Schmitt |newspaper=The New York Times |title=A Nation Challenged; Military Campaign; Taliban Defeated, Pentagon Asserts, but War Goes On |archivedate=February 25, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225062850/http://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/11/world/nation-challenged-military-campaign-taliban-defeated-pentagon-asserts-but-war.html |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; but cautioned that the war would go on to continue weakening Taliban and al-Qaeda leaders.&lt;ref name=taliband/&gt; Later that month the UN had installed the [[Afghan Transitional Administration]] chaired by [[Hamid Karzai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cdi.org/terrorism/isaf.cfm |title=Fact Sheet: International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan |publisher=[[Center for Defense Information]] |date=February 14, 2002 |accessdate=September 1, 2008 |archivedate=February 25, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225062850/http://www.cdi.org/terrorism/isaf.cfm |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4673026.stm |title=More Dutch troops for Afghanistan |publisher=BBC News |date=February 3, 2006 |accessdate=September 1, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225062850/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4673026.stm |archivedate=February 25, 2008 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, based on [[UNICEF]] figures, [[Nicholas Kristof]] reported that "our invasion of Afghanistan may end up saving one million lives over the next decade" as the result of improved healthcare and greater access to humanitarian aid.&lt;ref&gt;Kristof, Nicholas D., [https://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/01/opinion/a-merciful-war.html "A Merciful War,"] ''The New York Times'', February 1, 2002. "Now aid is pouring in and lives are being saved on an enormous scale. Unicef, for example, has vaccinated 734,000 children against measles over the last two months, in a country where virtually no one had been vaccinated against the disease in the previous 10 years. Because measles often led to death in Afghanistan, the vaccination campaign will save at least 35,000 children's lives each year... Heidi J. Larson of Unicef says that if all goes well, child and maternal mortality rates will drop in half in Afghanistan over the next five years. That would mean 112,000 fewer children and 7,500 fewer pregnant women dying each year."&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning with his January 29, 2002 [[State of the Union]] address, Bush began publicly focusing attention on Iraq, which he labeled as part of an "[[axis of evil]]" allied with terrorists and posing "a grave and growing danger" to U.S. interests through possession of [[weapons of mass destruction]].&lt;ref name=sotu2002/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Iraq: The War Card |url=http://www.iwatchnews.org/accountability/iraq-war-card |publisher=The Center for Public Integrity |accessdate=November 9, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225062850/http://www.iwatchnews.org/accountability/iraq-war-card |archivedate=February 25, 2008 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bush withdrew U.S. support for several international agreements, including the [[Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty]] (ABM) with Russia. He also signed the [[Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty]] with Russia.

Bush emphasized a careful approach to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians; he denounced [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] leader [[Yasser Arafat]] for his support of violence, but sponsored dialogues between Prime Minister [[Ariel Sharon]] and Palestinian National Authority President [[Mahmoud Abbas]]. Bush supported Sharon's unilateral disengagement plan, and lauded the democratic elections held in Palestine after Arafat's death.

Bush opened the [[2002 Winter Olympics]] in Salt Lake City, Utah. Departing from previous practice, he stood among a group of U.S. athletes rather than from a ceremonial stand or box, saying: "On behalf of a proud, determined, and grateful nation, I declare open the Games of Salt Lake City, celebrating the Olympic Winter Games."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2002/02/20020209-2.html |title=President Bush Opens 2002 Olympic Games |date=February 8, 2002 |publisher=The White House |accessdate=June 23, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514195905/http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2002/02/20020209-2.html |archivedate=May 14, 2011 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, in the course of a good-will trip to Asia, he attended the [[2008 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in Beijing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=August 22, 2008 |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26131736/ |title=Bush: Olympics exceeded my expectations |agency=Associated Press |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080822105310/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26131736 |archivedate=August 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bush twice invoked [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution#Section 3: Presidential declaration|Section 3 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment]], which allows a president to temporarily transfer the powers and duties of his office to the vice president, who then becomes [[Acting President of the United States|acting president]]. On June 29, 2002, Bush underwent a [[colonoscopy]] and chose to invoke Section 3 of the amendment, making Vice President [[Dick Cheney]] the acting president. The medical procedure began at 7:09&amp;nbsp;am. EDT and ended at 7:29&amp;nbsp;am. EDT. Bush woke up twenty minutes later, but did not resume his presidential powers and duties until 9:24&amp;nbsp;am. EDT after the president's doctor, [[Richard Tubb]], conducted an overall examination. Tubb said he recommended the additional time to make sure the sedative had no after effects. On July 21, 2007, Bush again invoked Section 3 in response to having to undergo a colonoscopy, again making Vice President Cheney the acting president. Bush invoked Section 3 at 7:16&amp;nbsp;am. EDT. He reclaimed his powers at 9:21&amp;nbsp;am. EDT. In both cases, Bush specifically cited Section 3 when he transferred the presidential powers to the Vice President and when he reclaimed those powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/acting_presidents.php |title=Acting Presidents Under the 25th Amendment |publisher=American Presidency Project |accessdate=November 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the announcement of [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] Justice [[Sandra Day O'Connor]]'s retirement on July 1, 2005, Bush nominated [[John Roberts]] to succeed her. On September 5, following the death of [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[William Rehnquist]], this nomination was withdrawn and Bush instead nominated Roberts for Chief Justice to succeed Rehnquist. Roberts was confirmed by the Senate as the 17th Chief Justice on September 29, 2005.

On October 3, 2005, Bush nominated long time White House Counsel [[Harriet Miers]] for O'Connor's position. After facing significant opposition from both parties, who found her to be ill-prepared and uninformed on the law,&lt;ref name="Greenburg, Jan Crawford 2007. Page 278"&gt;Greenburg, Jan Crawford.

Four days later, on October 31, Bush nominated federal appellate judge [[Samuel Alito]]. Alito was confirmed as the 110th Supreme Court Justice on January 31, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=U.S. Senate Roll Call Votes&amp;nbsp;– Nomination of Samuel Alito |url=https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=109&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00002 |publisher=Senate.gov |accessdate=July 31, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829201552/https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=109&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00002 |archivedate=August 29, 2008 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other courts====
{{Main|List of federal judges appointed by George W. Bush}}
In addition to his two Supreme Court appointments, Bush appointed 61 judges to the [[United States courts of appeals]] and 261 judges to the [[United States district court]]s. Each of these numbers, along with his total of 324 judicial appointments, is third in American history, behind both [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[Bill Clinton]]. Bush experienced a number of [[George W. Bush judicial appointment controversies|judicial appointment controversies]]. Debate during one confirmation session lasted "39 stupefying hours" according to ''The New York Times''. On August 3, 2001, the Senate did not consent to keep existing nominations in ''status quo'', returning 40 judicial nominations, and 164 total nominations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/10/20081006-5.html |title=President Bush Discusses Judicial Accomplishments and Philosophy |date=October 6, 2008 |publisher=The White House |place=Cincinnati, Ohio |accessdate=June 23, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813153034/http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/10/20081006-5.html |archivedate=August 13, 2009 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Source states "For the first time in history, the Senate used a filibuster to block a nominee to the Court of Appeals" hence one specific example is exactly in source {{not in source|date=June 2012}}--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/16/weekinreview/page-two-buzzwords.html |title=PAGE TWO: BUZZWORDS |newspaper=The New York Times |date=November 16, 2003 |archivedate=April 24, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130424160347/http://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/16/weekinreview/page-two-buzzwords.html |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Denis Steven Rutkus |author2=Mitchel A.

At the outset, Judicature magazine noted that the "Senate Democrats were gearing up for the approaching confirmation hearings" before the first set of nominees were sent to the Senate. It then cites ''The New York Times'' as saying "Senate Democrats have pledged they will not automatically vote to confirm Mr. Bush's judicial nominees and will subject them to intense scrutiny."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-2564309961.html |title="Strict Scrutiny?" the Content of Senate Judicial Confirmation Hearings during the George W.

===Reception===
The George W. Bush presidency has been ranked among the worst in [[Historical rankings of Presidents of the United States|surveys of presidential scholars]] published in the late 2000s and 2010s.&lt;ref name="US News"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Austin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mann"/&gt;

After his re-election in 2004, Bush received increasingly heated [[Public image of George W. Bush|criticism]] from across the [[political spectrum]]&lt;ref name="Republican right abandoning Bush"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kelley Beaucar Vlahos"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Baker"/&gt; for his handling of the Iraq War, [[Hurricane Katrina]],&lt;ref name="TVNZ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mike M. Ahlers"/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; and other challenges. Amid this criticism, the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] regained control of Congress in the [[United States elections, 2006|2006 elections]]. In December 2007, the United States entered its longest post-[[World War II]] recession, often referred to as the "[[Great Recession]]", prompting the Bush administration to obtain congressional passage of multiple economic programs intended to preserve the country's financial system. Nationally, Bush was both one of the most popular and unpopular presidents in history, having received the highest recorded presidential approval ratings in the wake of the September 11 attacks, as well as one of the lowest approval ratings during the [[Financial crisis of 2007–08|2008 financial crisis]].&lt;ref name="Gallup"/&gt;

Bush said in 2013, "Ultimately history will judge the decisions I made, and I won't be around because it will take time for the objective historians to show up. So I am pretty comfortable with it. I did what I did."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/jul/2/george-w-bush-history-will-judge-opinion-polls-i-c/ |title=George W.

Bush also attacked Obama's withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq in 2011, calling it a "strategic blunder", borrowing a term that had been used by South Carolina Senator [[Lindsey Graham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-04-28/the-lone-jewish-republican-in-congress-is-nostalgic-for-president-bush |title=The Lone Jewish Republican in Congress Is Nostalgic for George W.

In an interview published by ''[[Israel Hayom]]'' magazine on June 12, 2015, Bush said that "boots on the ground" would be needed in order to defeat the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIS). He added that people had said during his presidency that he should withdraw American troops from Iraq, but he chose the opposite, sending 30,000 more troops in order to defeat [[Al Qaeda in Iraq]], and that Al Qaeda in Iraq was defeated. Bush was also asked about Iran but declined to answer, stating that any answer he gives would be interpreted as undermining President [[Barack Obama]].&lt;ref name=IsraelHayom&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.israelhayom.com/site/newsletter_article.php?id=26127 |title=My position was: you need to have boots on the ground |author1=Amos Regev |author2=Boaz Bismuth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the white nationalist [[Unite the Right rally]] in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]], Bush and his father released a joint statement condemning the violence and ideologies present at the rally; “America must always reject racial bigotry, anti-Semitism, and hatred in all forms.

President Bush's legacy continues to develop today. Supporters credit Bush's counterterrorism policies with preventing another major terrorist attack from occurring in the US after 9/11 and also praise individual policies such as the [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] prescription drug benefit and the AIDS relief program known as [[PEPFAR]]. Critics often point to his handling of the [[Iraq War]], specifically the failure to find [[Iraq and weapons of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]], that were the main rationale behind the initial invasion—as well as his handling of [[Taxation in the United States|tax policy]], [[Hurricane Katrina]], [[climate change]] and the [[2008 financial crisis]]—as proof that George W.

Several historians and commentators hold the view that Bush was one of the most consequential presidents in American history.
