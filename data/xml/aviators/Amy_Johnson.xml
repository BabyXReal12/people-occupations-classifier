'''Amy Johnson''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|size=100%|CBE}} (1 July 1903 – 5 January 1941) was a pioneering English  [[aviator]] who was the first female pilot to fly alone from Britain to Australia.

Flying solo or with her husband, [[Jim Mollison]], she set numerous long-distance records during the 1930s. She flew in the [[World War II|Second World War]] as a part of the [[Air Transport Auxiliary]] and died during a [[Ferry flying|ferry flight]].&lt;ref name="Live"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/8-unsung-women-explorers-180658286.html |title=8 Unsung Women Explorers.|work=Our Amazing Planet, [[LiveScience.com]]|date= 30 April 2012|accessdate= 30 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Amy Johnson was born at 154 St. George's Road in [[Kingston upon Hull]], [[East Riding of Yorkshire]], the eldest of the four daughters of
John William Johnson, a member of the family fish merchants firm of Andrew Johnson, Knudtzon and Company, and Amy Hodge, granddaughter of William Hodge, [[List of Mayors of Kingston upon Hull|Mayor of Hull]] in 1860.&lt;ref name="local_studies"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hullwebs.co.uk/content/l-20c/people/amy-johnson/amy-johnson.pdf |title=Amy Johnson pioneering aviator |publisher=Hull Local Studies Library, Hull City Council |accessdate=19 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson was educated at Boulevard Municipal Secondary School (later [[Kingston High School, Hull|Kingston High School]]) and the [[University of Sheffield]], where she graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics.&lt;ref name=d194&gt;Dunmore, Spencer (2004). "Undaunted: Long-Distance Flyers in the Golden Age of Aviation" Toronto: McClelland &amp; Stewart. {{ISBN|0771029373}}. pp. 194–195.&lt;/ref&gt; She then worked in London as secretary to a solicitor, William Charles Crocker. She was introduced to flying as a hobby, gaining an aviator's certificate, No. 8662, on 28 June 1929,&lt;ref&gt;''Flight'' magazine, 23 October 1929&lt;/ref&gt; and a pilot's "A" Licence, No. 1979, on 6 July 1929, both at the London Aeroplane Club under the tutelage of Captain [[Valentine Baker (pilot)|Valentine Baker]]. In that same year, she became the first British woman to obtain a ground engineer's "C" licence.&lt;ref name="Aitken"&gt;Aitken, Kenneth (July 1991). "Amy Johnson (The Speed Seekers)." ''Aeroplane Monthly'', Vol. 19, no. 7, Issue no. 219. p. 440.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aviation career ==
[[File:Amy Johnson 1930-06-14.jpg|thumb|left|Johnson in her Black Hawk Moth leaving Australia for Newcastle, 14 June 1930]]
Johnson obtained the funds for her first aircraft from her father, who would always be one of her strongest supporters, and [[Charles Wakefield, 1st Viscount Wakefield|Lord Wakefield]].&lt;ref name=d194/&gt; She purchased a second-hand [[de Havilland DH.60 Moth|de Havilland DH.60 Gipsy Moth]] G-AAAH and named it ''Jason'' after her father's business trade mark.{{#tag:ref|Her father was a partner in the Andrew Johnson Knudtzon Fish Merchants.|group=Note}}

Johnson achieved worldwide recognition when, in 1930, she became the first woman pilot or aviatrix to fly solo from England to Australia. Flying G-AAAH ''Jason'', she left [[Croydon]], south of London, on 5 May and landed at [[Darwin, Northern Territory]] on 24 May {{convert|11000|mi}}.&lt;ref name="Newnes"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Marshall, A.

"Jason" was later flown to Mascot, Sydney, by Captain Lester Brain.&lt;ref name="State Library of New South Wales"&gt;{{cite book|title=Captain Lester Brain beside Amy's "Jason"|year=1931|publisher=Ted Hood | quote= information from original catalogue record|url=http://archival.sl.nsw.gov.au/Details/archive/110423419J}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article2304553 |title=MISS AMY JOHNSON |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] |volume=4, |issue=813 |location=Australian Capital Territory, Australia |date=30 May 1930 |accessdate=24 May 2018 |page=1 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The aircraft is preserved in the [[Science Museum (London)|Science Museum]], London. She received the [[Harmon Trophy]] as well as a [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] in [[George V]]'s [[1930 Birthday Honours]] in recognition of this achievement, and was also honoured with the No. 1 civil pilot's licence under Australia's 1921 Air Navigation Regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=33611 |date=30 May 1930 |page=3481  |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="slwa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slwa.wa.gov.au/treasures/brearley/index.htm |title=Brearley Pilot's Licences|work=Treasures of the Battye Library|publisher= [[State Library of Western Australia]]|accessdate=15 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|A de Havilland DH 60G Gipsy Moth ''G-ABDV'', named "Jason III" was given to Johnson on her return to England.&lt;ref name="Science Museum"&gt;[http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/onlinestuff/stories/amy_johnson.aspx?page=6 "Amy Johnson."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120917003512/http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/onlinestuff/stories/amy_johnson.aspx?page=6 |date=17 September 2012 }} ''The Science Museum'' (South Kensington. UK), 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}

Johnson next obtained [[de Havilland Puss Moth|de Havilland DH.80 Puss Moth]] G-AAZV which she named ''Jason II''. In July 1931, she and co-pilot [[Jack Humphreys]] became the first to fly from London to [[Moscow]] in one day, completing the {{convert|1760|mi}} journey in approximately 21 hours. From there, they continued across [[Siberia]] and on to [[Tokyo]], setting a record time for Britain to Japan.&lt;ref name="Science Museum" /&gt;

In 1932, Johnson married Scottish pilot [[Jim Mollison]], who had proposed to her during a flight together some eight hours after they had first met. In July 1932, Johnson set a solo record for the flight from London to [[Cape Town]], South Africa in Puss Moth G-ACAB, named ''Desert Cloud'',  breaking her new husband's record.&lt;ref name="Science Museum" /&gt;

[[File:Mollison and Johnson.jpg|thumb|left|On 29 July 1932, Amy Johnson and Jim Mollison married.]]
Her next flights were with Mollison as a duo. In July 1933, they first flew ''G-ACCV'', named "''Seafarer''," a [[de Havilland Dragon|de Havilland DH.84 Dragon I]]&lt;ref name="Science Museum" /&gt; nonstop from [[Pendine Sands]], [[South Wales]], heading to [[Floyd Bennett Field]] in [[Brooklyn]], New York.&lt;ref&gt;Ignasher, Jim (30 December 2015).

Retrieved: 9 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Their aircraft ran out of fuel and crash-landed at Bridgeport Municipal Airport (now [[Sikorsky Memorial Airport]]) in [[Stratford, Connecticut]]; both were injured.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1933/07/24/page/1/article/fly-ocean-crash-near-goal "Fly ocean, crash near goal."] ''Chicago Daily Tribune'', 24 July 1933. Retrieved: 9 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; After recuperating, the pair were feted by New York society and received a [[ticker tape]] parade down Wall Street.&lt;ref name="Aitken" /&gt;

The Mollisons also flew, in record time, from Britain to India in 1934 in ''G-ACSP'', named "''Black Magic''", a [[de Havilland DH.88]] Comet as part of the Britain to Australia [[MacRobertson Air Race]]. They were forced to retire from the race at [[Allahabad]] because of engine trouble.&lt;ref name="Science Museum" /&gt;

In May 1936, Johnson made her last record-breaking flight, regaining her Britain to South Africa record in ''G-ADZO'', a [[Percival Gull]] Six.&lt;ref name="Aitken" /&gt;

In 1938, Johnson overturned her glider when landing after a display at [[Walsall Aerodrome]] in England, but was not seriously hurt.&lt;ref name="BCB"&gt;[http://www.blackcountrybugle.co.uk/News/Helliwells-aircraft-component-factory-at-Walsall-airport.htm "Helliwells aircraft component factory at Walsall airport."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928060551/http://www.blackcountrybugle.co.uk/News/Helliwells-aircraft-component-factory-at-Walsall-airport.htm |date=28 September 2011 }} ''Black Country Bugle'', 25 November 2010. Retrieved: 19 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  The same year, she divorced Mollison. Soon afterwards, she reverted to her maiden name.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Constance Babington (2004). ''Amy Johnson''.  Stroud, Gloucestershire, UK: The History Press Ltd. {{ISBN|978-0-75093-703-0}}. pp. 312–313.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Second World War ==
In 1940, during the Second World War, Johnson joined the newly formed [[Air Transport Auxiliary]] (ATA), whose job was to transport [[Royal Air Force]] aircraft around the country – and rose to [[Air Transport Auxiliary#Ranks|First Officer]]. Her former husband also flew for the ATA throughout the war.&lt;ref name="Live" /&gt;

== Death ==
On 5 January 1941, while flying an [[Airspeed Oxford]] for the ATA from Prestwick via [[Blackpool International Airport|Blackpool]] to [[RAF Kidlington]] near [[Oxford]], Johnson went off course in adverse weather conditions. Reportedly out of fuel, she bailed out as her aircraft crashed into the [[Thames Estuary]] near Herne Bay.

The crew of [[HMS Haslemere]]{{#tag:ref|''Haslemere'' was a small, former ferry that in Royal Navy wartime service was being used as a [[barrage balloon]] ship.|group=Note}} spotted Johnson's parachute coming down and saw her alive in the water, calling for help. Conditions were poor – there was a heavy sea and a strong tide, snow was falling and it was intensely cold.&lt;ref name="Times17May41" /&gt; Lt Cmdr Walter Fletcher, the commander of ''Haslemere'', dived into the water in an attempt to rescue Johnson.&lt;ref name="Times17May41" /&gt; Fletcher failed in the attempt. As a result of the intense cold he died in hospital days later. In 2016, Alec Gill, a historian, claimed that the son of a crew member stated that Johnson had died because she was sucked into the blades of the ship's propellers; the crewman did not observe this to occur, but believes it is true.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/12085305/Flying-pioneer-Amy-Johnson-chopped-to-pieces-by-Royal-Navy-ships-propeller-historian-says.html "Flying pioneer Amy Johnson 'chopped to pieces by Royal Navy ship's propeller', historian says"], ''Daily Telegraph'', by Sophie Jameson &amp; Patrick Foster, 6 January 2016, retrieved 18 August 2016&lt;/ref&gt; This claim has not been verified, as Johnson's body was never recovered.

A memorial service was held for Johnson in the church of [[St. Martin in the Fields]] on 14 January 1941. Walter Fletcher was posthumously awarded the [[Albert Medal (lifesaving)|Albert Medal]] in May 1941.&lt;ref name="Times17May41"&gt;"Heroes Of Air Raids Civil Defence Awards, Rescues In Face Of Danger." ''The Times'' (London), Issue 48928, 17 May 1941, p. 2. Retrieved: 27 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a member of the ATA with no known grave, she is (under the name Amy V. Johnson) commemorated by the [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]] on the [[Air Forces Memorial]] at [[Runnymede]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/1802112/JOHNSON,%20AMY%20V "CWGC Casualty Record: Johnson, Amy V.] ''Commonwealth War Graves Commission''. Retrieved: 10 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Disputed circumstances ===
Johnson had been one of the original subscribers to the share offer for Airspeed.&lt;ref&gt;McKee, Alexander (1982). ''Great Mysteries of Aviation''. New York: Stein &amp; Day. {{ISBN|0-8128-2840-2}}. pp. 139–152, 293.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been more recently hinted her death was due to [[friendly fire]]. In 1999, it was reported that Tom Mitchell, from [[Crowborough]], [[Sussex]], claimed to have shot Johnson's aircraft down when she twice failed to give the correct identification code during the flight. Mitchell explained how the aircraft was sighted and contacted by radio. A request was made for the signal. She gave the wrong one twice. "Sixteen rounds of shells were fired and the plane dived into the Thames Estuary. We all thought it was an enemy plane until the next day when we read the papers and discovered it was Amy. The officers told us never to tell anyone what happened."&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Alison (6 February 1999). "I think I shot down Amy Johnson." ''The Scotsman''.&lt;/ref&gt;

During her life, Johnson was recognised in many ways. In June 1930, Johnson's flight to Australia was the subject of a contemporary popular song, "Amy, Wonderful Amy", composed by Horatio Nicholls and recorded by [[Harry Bidgood]], Jack Hylton, Arthur Lally, Arthur Rosebery and Debroy Somers. She was also the guest of honour at the opening of the first [[Butlins]] holiday camp, in [[Skegness]] in 1936. From 1935 to 1937, Johnson was the President of the [[Women's Engineering Society]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wes.org.uk/?q=content/past-presidents "Past Presidents."] ''Women's Engineering Society.''
