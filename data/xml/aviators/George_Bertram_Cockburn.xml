'''George Bertram Cockburn''' [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] (8 January 1872 – 25 February 1931) was a research chemist who became an aviation pioneer.   He represented Great Britain in the first international air race at [[Rheims]] and co-founded the first aerodrome for the army at [[Larkhill]].   He also trained the first four  pilots of what was to become the [[Fleet Air Arm]].    During [[World War I]] he worked as a Government Inspector of Aeroplanes for the [[Royal Flying Corps]] at [[Farnborough Airfield|Farnborough]] and subsequently became Head of the [[Air Accidents Investigation Branch|Accidents Branch]] of the Department of the Controller-General of [[Civil Aviation]] at the [[Air Ministry]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/warinairbeingsto01raleuoft/warinairbeingsto01raleuoft_djvu.txt Raleigh, Sir Walter, (1922), ''The War in the Air''], page 143, Hamish Hamilton SBN 241 01805 6&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Bertram Cockburn was the youngest child of George Cockburn, a [[Liverpool]] provisions merchant, and his second wife Katherine Jessie Stitt (née Bertram). Both his parents having previously been widowed, he had four older half siblings from his parents' first marriages –  John Scott Cockburn,  Ada Cockburn, Mary Cockburn and Katie Stitt.&lt;ref&gt;BMD Records England and Scotland&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wishful-thinking.org.uk/genuki/GLS/Taynton/MIs.html Taynton Memorial Inscriptions]&lt;/ref&gt;  The family lived across the [[River Mersey]] at Lingdale Lodge, Shrewsbury Road in [[Oxton, Merseyside|Oxton]], [[Birkenhead]].&lt;ref&gt;1871,1881,1901 Census Records&lt;/ref&gt; 
Several earlier generations of the Cockburn family had lived in [[Inveresk]] south east of [[Edinburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;Registers of Inveresk Parish  Kirk&lt;/ref&gt;  However, George Cockburn (Senior), who had travelled south to seek his fortune, had become sufficiently prosperous to be able to send both his sons to be educated at fee paying schools in [[Scotland]].   John, who became a [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] minister,&lt;ref&gt;Records of St. Paul's United Reformed Church (formerly Presbyterian) Harrogate&lt;/ref&gt;  attended [[Edinburgh Academy]] then [[Glasgow University]] &lt;ref&gt;Records of Edinburgh Academy&lt;/ref&gt; and George (Junior) was sent to [[Loretto School]] in [[Musselburgh]] from 1887 until 1892.&lt;ref&gt;Records of Loretto School&lt;/ref&gt;
In  October 1892 Bertram Cockburn entered [[New College, Oxford]] to read [[Natural Sciences]] specialising in [[Chemistry]].   He graduated in 1895.&lt;ref&gt;Register of New College, Oxford&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Research Chemist===
On leaving [[Oxford]] he went to the Chemistry Laboratory of [[St George's Hospital]] in London to work with John Addyman Gardner  &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsc.org/publishing/journals/JR/article.asp?doi=JR9470000865 Obituary Notice, John Addyman Gardner]&lt;/ref&gt; on the study of fenchones.  Between 1897 and 1898 they jointly published four papers in the [[Journal of the Chemical Society]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsc.org/publishing/journals/CT/article.asp?doi=CT8977101156 John Addyman Gardner M.A.  and George Bertram Cockburn B.A.  ''Action of Phosphorus Pentachloride on Fenchone''], (1897) Journal of the Chemical Society Transactions&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsc.org/publishing/journals/CT/article.asp?doi=CT8987300275 John Addyman Gardner M.A. and George Bertram Cockburn B.A. ''Researches on the terpenes. II. On the oxidation of fenchene''], (1898) Journal of the Chemical Society Transactions&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsc.org/publishing/journals/CT/article.asp?doi=CT8987300704 John Addyman Gardner M.A.  and George Bertram Cockburn B.A. ''Researches on the terpenes. III. Halogen derivatives of fenchone and their reactions''], (1898) Journal of the Chemical Society Transactions&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsc.org/publishing/journals/CT/article.asp?doi=CT8987300708 John Addyman Gardner M.A. and George Bertram Cockburn B.A. ''Researches on the terpenes. IV. On the oxidation of fenchone''], (1898) Journal of the Chemical Society Transactions&lt;/ref&gt; In 1899 Bertram Cockburn published a fifth paper on fencholenic acids independently of Gardner.  By this time, he had received his BSc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsc.org/publishing/journals/CT/article.asp?doi=CT8997500501 George Bertram Cockburn B.A., B.Sc.,  ''Isomeric fencholenic acids''], (1898) Journal of the Chemical Society Transactions&lt;/ref&gt;

His father died in 1893 while he was at Oxford &lt;ref&gt;BMD Records England&lt;/ref&gt; and, by 1901, he had returned to Birkenhead to live with his widowed mother and unmarried sister Mary.&lt;ref&gt;1901 Census Records&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the death of his mother in 1903,&lt;ref&gt;BMD Records England&lt;/ref&gt; they sold the family home and moved to Taynton in [[Gloucestershire]].&lt;ref&gt;Kelly's Directory, (1910) Gloucestershire&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pioneer Aviator===
In February 1909 Bertram Cockburn was elected to membership of the [[Royal Aero Club]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1909/1909%20-%200121.html?search=cockburn ''Flight Magazine'', 27 February 1909]&lt;/ref&gt; and, later that year, travelled to France to become the first pupil in [[Henri Farman]]'s flying school at [[Châlons-sur-Marne]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=tDmR7DhM_uEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=contact+early+aviators&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=mMldm8r3Vs&amp;sig=3dJ84Z9-4Nlhfu1gJvVnuvbPa2U&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=YNHoS5CCJpv40wTGzbHgDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=cockburn&amp;f=false Villard, Henry(1987) ''Contact! The Story of the Early Aviators''], page 76, Smithsonian Institution Press, {{ISBN|0-486-42327-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his first flight in June of that year &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1909/1909%20-%200361.html?search=cockburn ''Flight Magazine'', 19 June 1909]&lt;/ref&gt; and took part in the [[Grande Semaine d'Aviation]] at Rheims in August.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/photos/publicresourceorg/494114621/ Events 1909 Rheims, Grande Semaine D'Aviation de la Champagne]&lt;/ref&gt; He represented Great Britain in the competition for the [[Gordon Bennett Trophy (aeroplanes)|Gordon Bennett Cup]] but unfortunately crashed into a haystack and was unable to complete the course.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liv.ac.uk/flightscience/rheims_1909.htm University of Liverpool, Flight Science and Technology, The Reims Air Meeting 1909]&lt;/ref&gt;

He returned to Britain with a [[Farman III]] biplane and, on 26 April the following year, he received [[Royal Aero Club]] certificate number 5.   By this time he was resident at [[St Mary Bourne]] near [[Andover, Hampshire]].&lt;ref&gt;Records of the Royal Aero Club&lt;/ref&gt;  In June 1910, he won a prize of £100 in the 'Quick Starting' Competition at the [[Wolverhampton]] Air Meet .&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1910/1910%20-%200500.html?search=cockburn ''Flight Magazine'', 2 July 1910]&lt;/ref&gt;
Although he actively promoted  air races as an incentive to develop improvements in aircraft performance,&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9A07E5DB1230E233A2575AC1A9619C946196D6CF ''New York Times'',  19 July 1910]&lt;/ref&gt; he never flew competitively again following the death of his friend [[Charles Rolls]] at [[Bournemouth]].   In 1912 he became a founder member of the Royal Aero Club's Public Safety and Accidents Investigation Committee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1912/1912%20-%200971.html?search=cockburn ''Flight Magazine'', 26 October 1912]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trainer of Pilots===
On returning from France, Bertram Cockburn devoted himself to the training of other pilots.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=VAn3ySgxNXkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=old+flying+days&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qkCKBko-GJ&amp;sig=b2Sagbn4_uX_fTX3Q2EiaY-o1mQ&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=tBTnS4uUOIn40wT28bDWBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Turner ,Charles Cyril, (1972), ''The Old Flying Days''], page 200, Arno Press, {{ISBN|0-405-03783-X}},&lt;/ref&gt;  He obtained permission from the army to rent a shed at Larkhill adjacent to [[Salisbury Plain]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=sjWsAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=the+impact+of+air+power+on+the+British+people+and+their+government&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=McK5dn9a6V&amp;sig=h-UBtW8W96kUQPU8zyG5VeVHHR0&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=SBfnS5roH5j60wTb3eXQBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=cockburn&amp;f=false Gollin, Alfred M., ''The Impact of Air Power on the British People and their Government (1909–1914)''], pages 92 &amp; 93, Stanford University Press, {{ISBN|0-8047-1591-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; From here he and other aviators gave private instruction in flying to army officers.   By 1910, he and [[John Fulton (aviator)|Captain JBD Fulton]] had founded the first aerodrome for the army.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.this-is-amesbury.co.uk/military.html Aviation on Salisbury Plain]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1911, following the death of [[Cecil Grace]] in a flying accident, he volunteered to train the first four naval pilots at [[Eastchurch]] on the [[Isle of Sheppey]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1911/1911%20-%200418.html?search=cockburn ''Flight Magazine'', 13 May 1911]&lt;/ref&gt; This he did free of charge&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=VAn3ySgxNXkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=old+flying+days&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qkCKBko-GJ&amp;sig=b2Sagbn4_uX_fTX3Q2EiaY-o1mQ&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=tBTnS4uUOIn40wT28bDWBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Turner, Charles Cyril, (1972) ''The Old Flying Days''], page 19, Arno Press, {{ISBN|0-405-03783-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; while lodging with [[Maurice Egerton]] &lt;ref&gt;1911 Census Records&lt;/ref&gt; after which he returned to Larkhill.

===Aircraft Inspector===
In 1913, as war approached, Bertram Cockburn resigned his Fellowship of the [[Chemical Society]]  &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsc.org/delivery/_ArticleLinking/DisplayArticleForFree.cfm?doi=CT9130300700&amp;JournalCode=CT Chemical Society Annual General Meeting, 14 May 1913]&lt;/ref&gt;  and in 1914 was appointed to be an Inspector of Aeroplanes for the Aeronautical Inspection Directorate of the [[Royal Flying Corps]] at [[Farnborough Airfield|Farnborough]].   In the New Years Honours of 1918, he was awarded an [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] for his services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/30460/supplements/376 ''Supplement to the London Gazette'', 7 January 1918]&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly afterwards, he became Head of the newly established [[Air Accidents Investigation Branch|Accidents Branch]] of the Department of the Controller-General of Civil Aviation, Air Ministry.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=VAn3ySgxNXkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=old+flying+days&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qkCKBko-GJ&amp;sig=b2Sagbn4_uX_fTX3Q2EiaY-o1mQ&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=tBTnS4uUOIn40wT28bDWBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Turner ,Charles Cyril (1972) ''The Old Flying Days''], page 72, Arno Press, {{ISBN|0-405-03783-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1919/oct/30/route-to-egypt-losses-inquiry ''Route to Egypt Losses Enquiry'', Hansard, 30 October 1919 vol 120 cc914-5W]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
On 12 February 1913 he married Lilian Woodhouse, daughter of a sugar broker. They had one daughter, Joan, who was born in 1914.  He died at Larksborough near [[Whitchurch, Hampshire|Whitchurch]] in [[Hampshire]] in 1931, aged of 59.&lt;ref&gt;BMD Records England&lt;/ref&gt;
