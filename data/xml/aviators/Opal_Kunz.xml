'''Opal Kunz''' (November 6, 1894 – May 15, 1967)&lt;ref name=birthdate/&gt;  was an early American [[aviator]], the chief organizer of the [[Betsy Ross Air Corps]], and a charter member of the [[Ninety-Nines]] organization of women pilots. In 1930, she became the first woman pilot to race with men in an open competition. She made many public appearances to urge more women to take up flying. 

==Personal history==
Opal Logan Giberson was born in 1894 or 1896 in Missouri to Edward F. Giberson and his wife.&lt;ref name=maidenname/&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt8/&gt; She graduated from Dana Hall School in Wellesley, Massachusetts.&lt;ref name=nyt8/&gt;

In 1923, she married mineralogist [[George Frederick Kunz]] (1856–1932).&lt;ref name="Craig"/&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt7/&gt; The marriage was annulled in 1929.&lt;ref name=nyt3/&gt; The couple remained on good terms, with Kunz caring for George for the remainder of his life.&lt;ref name=nyt3/&gt; On his death, he left her a substantial bequest.&lt;ref name=nyt2/&gt;&lt;ref name=wdn/&gt;

==Aviation career==
Kunz earned her pilot's license in 1929. A crash two weeks later in New Jersey drew extensive press coverage; she escaped uninjured.&lt;ref name=nyt5/&gt;&lt;ref name=dn29/&gt; A second crash two years later left her with gasoline burns. &lt;ref name=nys3/&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt9/&gt; 

She spent a great deal of time and money on her flying pursuits and always named her planes after [[Betsy Ross]].&lt;ref name="Craig"/&gt; On April 7, 1930, at the Philadelphia American Legion Benefit Air Meet, she became the first woman to race with men in open competition.&lt;ref name="Craig"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kennedy"/&gt; She won the race.&lt;ref name=nyt4/&gt; 

Kunz gave frequent press interviews and radio addresses to urge more women to take up flying.&lt;ref name=wabc/&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt6/&gt;&lt;ref name=nys4/&gt;

===Powder Puff Derby===
In 1929, Kunz participated in the first [[Women's Air Derby]], later dubbed the "Powder Puff Derby" by humorist Will Rogers. At the time, there were only 70 licensed female pilots in the entire United States, and only 40 qualified to take part in this contest. The transcontinental course began in Santa Monica, California, and ended in Cleveland, Ohio. 

Race rules stipulated that the aircraft must have horsepower "appropriate for a woman." Kunz was told her own 300-horsepower Beech [[Travel Air]] was too fast for a woman to handle and would not be allowed. Forced to  borrow a less-powerful airplane in order to take part in the race, she finished eighth.&lt;ref name="Jessen"&gt;Jessen, Gene Nora. [http://www.ninety-nines.org/1929airrace.html "The 1929 Air Race"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090519071136/http://www.ninety-nines.org/1929airrace.html |date=2009-05-19 }}. The Ninety-Nines website. Accessed  May 14, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death of Jack Donaldson===
On September 7, 1930, Kunz loaned her plane to aviator [[John Donaldson (aviator)|John Donaldson]] at the American Legion Air Races meet in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Donaldson suffered fatal injuries when the airplane fell from a height of 1,800 feet straight down into the municipal airfield.&lt;ref name=gscn/&gt;

===Betsy Ross Air Corps===
Kunz was an organizer of the [[Betsy Ross Air Corps]], a paramilitary service formed to support to support the Army Air Corps (the precursor to the U.S. Air Force) in national defense and to serve as humanitarian "air minutemen"&lt;ref name=simbeck/&gt; in times of emergency.&lt;ref name="Kennedy"/&gt;&lt;ref name=douglas/&gt;&lt;ref name=nys/&gt;&lt;ref name=johnson/&gt;&lt;ref name=newark/&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; It also had the goal of offering flight instruction to women in order to build a reserve group of women aviators.&lt;ref name=nys/&gt;&lt;ref name=es/&gt;&lt;ref name=es2/&gt; Kunz grew the corps to about 100 members, partially funding it herself.&lt;ref name="Kennedy"/&gt;&lt;ref name=nyht/&gt; She served as the corps' first commander, and her husband designed its insignia.&lt;ref name=nys/&gt;&lt;ref name=dmaf/&gt;&lt;ref name=nys2/&gt;&lt;ref name=altick/&gt; The short-lived corps (1931–1933) was never formally recognized by the U.S. military.

===World War II===
As World War II approached, Kunz began teaching aviation students at [[Arkansas State College]]. In 1942, she moved to Rhode Island, and at the start of World War II became an instructor at the [[T. F. Green Airport|Rhode Island state airport]] for Navy cadets and for the government-sponsored [[Civilian Pilot Training Program]]. She taught several hundred young men how to fly for the war effort.&lt;ref name="Canton"/&gt; 

==Later years==
After the war, she became an inspector for the [[Aerojet]] Corporation in California.&lt;ref name="Canton"/&gt; 

In 1961, following after the historic space flight of the Russian cosmonaut [[Yuri Gagarin]], she wrote to President [[John F. Kennedy]] to volunteer her services as an American astronaut. In honor of her extensive aviation experience, the president wrote her a courteous reply.&lt;ref name=Canton /&gt;

Kunz [https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/48266661/opal-logan-kunz died] at home in [[Auburn, California]] in 1967.
