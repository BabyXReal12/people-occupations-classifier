'''Otto Lilienthal''' (23 May 1848 &amp;ndash; 10 August 1896) was a [[Germany|German]] pioneer of [[aviation]] who became known as the  ''flying man&lt;ref&gt;e. g. [http://lilienthal-museum.museumnet.eu/content/15851 newspaper article] New York Herald August 12th, 1896&lt;/ref&gt;''. He was the first person to make well-documented, repeated, successful flights with [[Glider (aircraft)|glider]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dlr.de/dlr/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-10280/385_read-16705/year-all/#/gallery/21944] ''DLR baut das erste Serien-Flugzeug der Welt nach,'' 2017. Retrieved: 3 March 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Newspapers and magazines published photographs of Lilienthal gliding, favorably influencing public and scientific opinion about the possibility of flying machines becoming practical. On 9 August 1896, his glider stalled and he was unable to regain control. Falling from about 15&amp;nbsp;m (50&amp;nbsp;ft), he broke his neck and died the next day, 10 August 1896.

==Early life==
Lilienthal was born on 23 May 1848 in [[Anklam]], [[Pomerania Province (1815-1945)|Pomerania Province]], German kingdom of [[Prussia]]. According to his birth certificate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.carnetdevol.org/Otto/naissance.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923200545/http://www.carnetdevol.org/Otto/naissance.html |archivedate=2015-09-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; his parents were Gustav and Caroline née Pohle. They belonged to the St. Nikolai evangelical church community in Anklam, where he later attended grammar school, and where he eventually studied the flight of birds with his brother Gustav (1849–1933).&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Transportation.'' New York: Rand-McNally, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; Fascinated by the idea of manned flight, Lilienthal and his brother made strap-on wings, but failed in their attempts to fly. He then attended the regional technical school in [[Potsdam]] for two years and trained at the Schwarzkopf Company before becoming a professional design engineer. He would later attend the Royal Technical Academy in Berlin.

In 1867, Lilienthal began experiments on the force of air in earnest, interrupted when he served in the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. As a staff engineer in various engineering companies, Lilienthal received his first patent for a mining machine. Five years later he founded his own company to make boilers and steam engines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lilienthal-museum.de/olma/edampf.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2018-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lilienthal published his famous book ''Birdflight as the Basis of Aviation'' in 1889.

Lilienthal was born to middle-class parents. They had eight children, but only three of them survived infancy: Otto, [[Gustav Lilienthal|Gustav]], and Marie.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson 2001, p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; The brothers worked together all their lives on technical, social, and cultural projects.

On 6 June 1878, Lilienthal married Agnes Fischer, daughter of a deputy. Music brought them together; she was trained in piano and voice while Lilienthal played the [[French horn]] and had a good [[tenor]] voice.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson 2001, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; After marriage, they took up residence in Berlin and had four children: Otto, Anna, Fritz, and Frida.&lt;ref name=FamilyTree&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Otto_Lilienthal.aspx "Otto Lilienthal."] ''Encyclopedia of World Biography,'' 2004.

==Experiments in flight==
[[File:Whitestorkflight.png|thumb|left|Mechanics of [[white stork]] flight in his ''Der Vogelflug als Grundlage der Fliegekunst'' (1889)]]
[[File:Otto Lilienthal gliding experiment ppmsca.02546.jpg|thumb|Lilienthal in mid-flight, c. 1895]]
Lilienthal's greatest contribution was in the development of heavier-than-air flight. He made his flights from an artificial hill he built near [[Berlin]] and from natural hills, especially in the [[Rhinow]] region.

The filing of a U.S. Patent in 1894 by Lilienthal directed pilots to grip the "bar" for carrying and flying the hang glider.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents?id=10xzAAAAEBAJ&amp;dq=544816 "Flying-Machine Otto Lilienthal.] ''Patents. Retrieved: 16 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The A-frame of [[Percy Pilcher]] and Lilienthal echoes in today's control frame for [[hang gliders]] and [[ultralight trike|ultralight]] aircraft.  Working in conjunction with his brother Gustav, Lilienthal made over 2,000 flights in gliders of his design starting in 1891 with his first glider version, the [[Derwitzer Glider|Derwitzer]], until his death in a gliding crash in 1896. His total flying time was five hours.&lt;ref name=Wright&gt;[http://www.lilienthal-museum.de/olma/ewright.htm "From Lilienthal to the Wrights."] ''Otto Lilienthal Museum.''  Retrieved: 8 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning, in 1891, Lilienthal succeeded with jumps and flights covering a distance of about {{Convert|25|m|ft}}. He could use the [[updraft]] of a 10&amp;nbsp;m/s wind against a hill to remain stationary with respect to the ground, shouting to a photographer on the ground to manoeuvre into the best position for a photo. In 1893, in the Rhinow Hills, he was able to achieve flight distances as long as {{Convert|250|m|ft}}.  This record remained unbeaten for him or anyone else at the time of his death.&lt;ref name=Wright/&gt;

Lilienthal did research in accurately describing the flight of birds, especially [[stork]]s, and used [[Polar curve (aviation)|polar diagrams]] for describing the [[aerodynamics]] of their wings. He made many experiments in an attempt to gather reliable aeronautical data.

===Projects===

[[File:Lilienthal hang glider.jpg|thumb|Restored 1894 glider displayed at the [[National Air and Space Museum]]. It is one of five surviving Lilienthal gliders in the world.]]
During his short flying career, Lilienthal developed a dozen models of [[monoplane]]s, [[ornithopter|wing flapping aircraft]] and two [[biplane]]s.&lt;ref name=Discovery&gt;[http://www.yourdiscovery.com/flight/pioneers_of_flight/otto_lilienthal/index.shtml "Pioneers of Flight: Otto Lilienthal."] ''[[Discovery Channel]].'' Retrieved: 8 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; His gliders were carefully designed to distribute weight as evenly as possible to ensure a stable flight. Lilienthal controlled them by changing the [[center of gravity]] by shifting his body, much like modern [[hang glider]]s.  However they were difficult to maneuvre and had a tendency to pitch down, from which it was difficult to recover.  One reason for this was that he held the glider by his shoulders, rather than hanging from it like a modern hang glider.  Only his legs and lower body could be moved, which limited the amount of weight shift he could achieve.

Lilienthal made many attempts to improve stability with varying degrees of success.  These included making a biplane which halved the wing span for a given wing area, and by having a hinged tailplane that could move upwards to make the flare at the end of a flight easier.  He speculated that flapping wings of birds might be necessary and had begun work on such a powered aircraft.

While his lifelong pursuit was flight, Lilienthal was also an inventor and devised a small engine that worked on a system of tubular boilers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lilienthal-museum.de/olma/edampf.htm "Documentation of the only preserved Lilienthal engine"] ''Otto Lilienthal Museum.'' Retrieved: 12 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; His engine was much safer than the other small engines of the time. This invention gave him the financial freedom to focus on [[aviation]]. His brother Gustav (1849–1933) was living in [[Australia]] at the time, and Lilienthal did not engage in aviation experiments until his brother's return in 1885.&lt;ref&gt;Runge and Lukasch: Erfinderleben. Die Brüder Otto und Gustav Lilienthal. Berlin 2007. {{ISBN|978-3-8333-0467-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Test locations===
Lilienthal performed his first gliding attempts in mid-1891 at the so-called "Windmühlenberg" near to the villages of Krielow and Derwitz which are located west of Potsdam.&lt;ref&gt;Seifert and Waßermann: Otto Lilienthal. Leben und Werk. Eine Biographie. Hamburg 1992: pp.&amp;nbsp;62–65. {{ISBN|3-924562-02-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1892, Lilienthal's training area was a hill formation called "Maihöhe" in [[Berlin-Steglitz|Steglitz]], near Berlin. He built a {{Convert|4|m|ft}} high shed, in the shape of a tower, on top of it. This way, he obtained a "jumping off" place {{Convert|10|m|ft}} high. The shed served also for storing his apparatus.&lt;ref name="The Flying Man"&gt;Chanute, O. [http://invention.psychology.msstate.edu/i/Chanute/library/Prog_Lilienthal_Flying.html "The Flying Man."] ''Progress in Flying Machines.'' Retrieved: 16 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1893, Lilienthal also started to perform gliding attempts in the "Rhinower Berge", at the "Hauptmannsberg" near to Rhinow and later, 1896, at the "Gollenberg" near to Stölln.&lt;ref&gt;Seifert and Waßermann: Otto Lilienthal. Leben und Werk. Eine Biographie. Hamburg 1992: pp.&amp;nbsp;73–80. {{ISBN|3-924562-02-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1894, Lilienthal built an artificial conical hill near his home in [[Lichterfelde (Berlin)|Lichterfelde]], called ''Fliegeberg'' (lit. "Fly Hill").&lt;ref&gt;[http://journeytoberlin.com/content/the-man-who-jumped-off-hills-otto-lilienthals-fliegerberg "The man who jumped off hills: Otto Lilienthal's Fliegerberg."] ''journeytoberlin.com.'' Retrieved: 8 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; It allowed him to launch his gliders into the wind no matter which direction it was coming from.&lt;ref name=Discovery/&gt; The hill was {{Convert|15|m|ft}} high.

==Worldwide notice==
{{unref|section|date=August 2018}}
Reports of Lilienthal's flights spread in Germany and elsewhere, with photographs appearing in scientific and popular publications. Among those who photographed him were [[History of photography|pioneers]] such as [[Ottomar Anschütz]] and American [[physicist]] [[Robert Williams Wood]]. He soon became known as the 'father of flight' as he had successfully controlled a heavier-than-air aircraft in sustained flight.

Lilienthal was a member of the ''[[Verein zur Förderung der Luftschifffahrt]]'', and regularly detailed his experiences in articles in its journal, the ''Zeitschrift für Luftschifffahrt und Physik der Atmosphäre'', and in the popular weekly publication ''Prometheus''. These were translated in the United States, France and Russia. Many people from around the world came to visit him, including [[Samuel Pierpont Langley]] from the United States, Russian [[Nikolai Yegorovich Zhukovsky|Nikolai Zhukovsky]], Englishman [[Percy Pilcher]] and Austrian [[Wilhelm Kress]]. Zhukovsky wrote that Lilienthal's flying machine was the most important invention in the aviation field. Lilienthal corresponded with many people, among them [[Octave Chanute]], [[James Means]], [[Alois Wolfmüller]] and other [[List of aviation pioneers|flight pioneers]].

==Final flight==
On 9 August 1896, Lilienthal went, as on previous weekends, to the Rhinow Hills. The day was very sunny and not too hot (about 20&amp;nbsp;°C, or 68&amp;nbsp;°F). The first flights were successful, reaching a distance of {{Convert|250|m|ft}} in his normal glider. During the fourth flight Lilienthal's glide pitched forward heading down quickly.  Lilienthal had previously had difficulty in recovering from this position because the glider relied on weight shift which was difficult to achieve when pointed at the ground.  His attempts failed and he fell from a height of about {{Convert|15|m|ft}}, while still in the glider.&lt;ref name=crash&gt;Harsch, Viktor, Benny Bardrum and Petra Illig. [http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/asma/asem/2008/00000079/00000010/art00011 "Lilienthal's Fatal Glider Crash in 1896: Evidence Regarding the Cause of Death."] ''Aviation, Space, and Environmental Medicine,'' Volume 79, Issue 101, October 2008, pp. 993–994. Retrieved: 7 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul Beylich, Lilienthal's glider mechanic, transported him by horse-drawn carriage to [[Stölln]], where he was examined by a physician. Lilienthal had a fracture of the [[Cervical vertebra 3|third cervical vertebra]] and soon became unconscious. Later that day he was transported in a cargo train to [[Berlin Hauptbahnhof|Lehrter train station]] in [[Berlin]], and the next morning to the clinic of [[Ernst von Bergmann]], one of the most famous and successful surgeons in Europe at the time. Lilienthal died there a few hours later (about 36 hours after the crash). 

There are differing accounts of Lilienthal's last words. A popular account, inscribed on his tombstone, is "{{Lang|de|Opfer müssen gebracht werden!}}" ("Sacrifices must be made!"). The director of the Otto Lilienthal Museum doubts that these were his last words. &lt;ref&gt;Reichhardt, Tony.

Retrieved: June 27, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;
Otto Lilienthal was buried at [[Lankwitz]] public cemetery in Berlin.

==Legacy==
Lilienthal's research was well known to the [[Wright brothers]], and they credited him as a major inspiration for their decision to pursue manned flight. However, they abandoned his aeronautical data after two seasons of gliding and began using their own wind tunnel data.&lt;ref&gt;Crouch 1989, pp. 226–228.&lt;/ref&gt;I

{{quote|"Of all the men who attacked the flying problem in the 19th century, Otto Lilienthal was easily the most important.&amp;nbsp;... It is true that attempts at gliding had been made hundreds of years before him, and that in the nineteenth century, [[George Cayley|Cayley]], Spencer, Wenham, Mouillard, and many others were reported to have made feeble attempts to glide, but their failures were so complete that nothing of value resulted."|''[[Wilbur Wright]] &lt;ref&gt;''Aero Club of America Bulletin'', September 1912.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Berlin's busiest airport, [[Berlin Tegel Airport|Berlin Tegel "Otto Lilienthal" Airport]], is named after him.

In September 1909, Orville Wright was in Germany making demonstration flights at [[Berlin Tempelhof Airport|Tempelhof]] aerodrome. He paid a call to Lilienthal's widow and, on behalf of himself and Wilbur, paid tribute to Lilienthal for his influence on aviation and on their own initial experiments in 1899.

In 1972, Lilienthal was inducted into the [[International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;Sprekelmeyer, Linda, editor. ''These We Honor: The International Aerospace Hall of Fame''.

Lilienthal was regularly joined by photographers at his request. Most of them are well known, like [[Ottomar Anschütz]]. Lilienthal was also constantly taking his own photographs of his flying machines after 1891.&lt;ref name=foto&gt;Lukasch, Bernd. [http://www.lilienthal-museum.de/olma/efoto.htm "Lilienthal and Photography."] ''Otto Lilienthal Museum.'' Retrieved: 13 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; There are at least 145 known photographs documenting his test flights, some of excellent quality. All of them are available online at [http://www.lilienthal-museum.de/olma/ebarchi.htm Otto Lilienthal Museum] website. The only negatives, preserved in the [[Deutsches Museum]] in Munich, were destroyed during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lilienthal-museum.de/olma/ebarchi.htm "Lilienthal Photo archives."] ''Otto Lilienthal Museum.''
