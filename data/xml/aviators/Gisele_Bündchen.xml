In September 2000, ''[[Newsweek]]'' drew attention to a craze for modeling in Brazil because of Bündchen's success:

{{quote|''Capricho'', a glossy teen magazine, recently asked 1,100 Brazilian teenagers if they wanted to become fashion models. Eighty-six percent said yes. The reason for this craze stands 1.77 meters tall and has smoldering blue eyes. Her name is Gisele Bundchen—known to all as Gisele—and she is the most celebrated Brazilian since Pele. First introduced by designer Alexander McQueen two years ago, Gisele, now 20, is the world's top cover girl, taking to more than 1,600 catwalks and earning a reported $7,000 an hour. When she struts her trademark runway walk—sassy and high-stepping, like a filly in tall grass—hearts beat faster from Milan to Manhattan. She has become an international icon: ''Vogue'' put the Brazilian bombshell on its cover three times last year and in December crowned her "Model of the Year."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=This Year's Model|url=http://www.newsweek.com/years-model-159397|website=Newsweek.com|accessdate=1 November 2014|date=25 September 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Bündchen pioneered the "horse walk", a stomping movement created when a model picks her knees up high and kicks her feet out in front.&lt;ref name="O'Connell"/&gt;

As of 2014, she is listed by ''Forbes'' as the 89th most powerful woman in the world.&lt;ref name=Forbes14&gt;{{cite news|title=The World's 100 Most Powerful Women|url=https://www.forbes.com/power-women/list/2/#tab:overall|website=Forbes.com|accessdate=26 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bündchen is the No. 2 biggest Brazilian celebrity of 2015 according to Forbes Brasil, based on media presence and overall influence in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=This Year's Model|url=https://www.forbes.com.br/listas/2015/11/25-maiores-celebridades-do-brasil-em-2015/#foto1|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170320015943/http://www.forbes.com.br/listas/2015/11/25-maiores-celebridades-do-brasil-em-2015/#foto1|archivedate=20 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Bündchen was dubbed the "Boobs from Brazil" for inspiring the 36,000 breast enhancement surgeries performed that year in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.people.com/people/gisele_bundchen "Celebrity Central / Top 25 Celebs"]. ''People''&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2006, ''[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]'' surveyed the American leading stylists and asked them to name the star whose hair was a favourite for their clients. More than 50 percent gave Bündchen the title of best hair in Hollywood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gisele Bundchen&amp;nbsp;– Gisele Tops Elle Hair Poll|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/article/gisele%20tops%20elle%20hair%20poll_1004086  |publisher=Contactmusic.com |accessdate=3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2008, a survey by the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (ISAPS) asked the question, "What influences do celebrities have on the decisions patients make"? The survey was sent to more than 20,000 plastic surgeons in 84 countries. Bündchen was among the most frequently mentioned celebrities. Bündchen won the abdomen and hair categories and placed second in the breasts category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isaps.org/uploads/news_pdf/MELB-PR-Celebrity.pdf |title=Celebrity Influences on Plastic Surgery |format=PDF |accessdate=22 June 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090612101906/http://www.isaps.org/uploads/news_pdf/MELB-PR-Celebrity.pdf |archivedate=12 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2008, a black-and-white photo of Bündchen, shot by [[Irving Penn]], auctioned for $193,000 (£96,000). Bündchen's fetched by far the most on the night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vogue.co.uk/person/gisele-bundchen |title=Gisele Bundchen |publisher=Vogue.co.uk |date= |accessdate=19 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was second on ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]''{{'}}s World's Most Beautiful poll in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/online/daily/2009/04/angelina-jolie-is-the-most-beautiful-woman-in-the-world |title=Angelina Jolie Is the Most Beautiful Woman in the World|accessdate=27 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In January 2011, Bündchen came in first in the ''most desired female body'' on the ''14th Annual Famed Hottest Looks'' survey, compiled by Beverly Hills plastic surgeons Richard Fleming and Toby Mayer. Even after giving birth in December 2009, her body was the most requested by the doctors' patients. "Different body types are represented on the list because most women are shaped differently and want to look naturally beautiful," explained Dr. Fleming. "Some women want the lean look like Gisele [...]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2011/01/06/gisele-bundchen-mark-wahlberg-plastic-surgery-celeb-bodies/ |publisher=Fox News |title=EXCLUSIVE: 14th Annual America's Most Wanted Celebrity Body Parts |date=6 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, [[AskMen.com]] revealed their annual "Most Desirable Women" list. Bündchen, along with [[Angelina Jolie]] and [[Beyoncé Knowles|Beyoncé]], are the only women to have made the list every year for 10 years in a row.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imnotobsessed.com/2011/02/01/askmen-99-most-desirable-women-blake-lively-mila-kunis-sofia-vergara-angelina-jolie-gisele-beyonc/ |title=Who's the Most Desirable Actress in Hollywood? |publisher=Imnotobsessed.com |date=19 September 2011 |accessdate=24 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130126113338/http://www.imnotobsessed.com/2011/02/01/askmen-99-most-desirable-women-blake-lively-mila-kunis-sofia-vergara-angelina-jolie-gisele-beyonc/ |archivedate=26 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Beyoncé in a 2011 Harper's Bazaar interview named Bündchen as one of her fashion inspirations stating that "I always admire [[Victoria Beckham]] and Gisele [Bündchen].

A designer from the Tibi Spring/Summer 2012 fashion show at New York Fashion week in fall 2011 explained, "The inspiration is taken heavily from the '90s—a freshly scrubbed Gisele from the pages of Vogue—clean, crisp, sporty looks and relaxed styles you want to live in."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackbookmag.com/article/amy-smilovic-elin-kling-on-styling-tibis-ss12-runway/26953 "Gisele Bündchen Closes Out Givenchy's All-Star Show"] 3 October 2011, New York Fashion.&lt;/ref&gt;
''Vogue'' editor [[Anna Wintour]] called her the "model of the millennium," and the magazine called her "The return of the sexy model". ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' declared her "The Most Beautiful Girl in the World" in 2000 and ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' published an article titled "...&amp;nbsp;And God Created Gisele" in 2009.&lt;ref name="vogue.com"/&gt; In 2012, the 26th edition of Casa Cor in Brazil, one of the world´s biggest decorating, landscaping, and architecture events, paid tribute to Bündchen with a wood sculpture in her image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.giselebundchen.com/.../casa-cor-pays-tribute-to-gisele |title=Gisele Bündchen - Site Oficial |publisher=Giselebundchen.com |date= |accessdate=24 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130628120405/http://www.giselebundchen.com/.../casa-cor-pays-tribute-to-gisele |archivedate=28 June 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2014, Bündchen was ranked No. 89 on ''Forbes''{{'}} 100 Most Powerful Women in the world list from the success of her various brands. She was the only model on the list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The World's Most Powerful Women 2014 - Forbes|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/carolinehoward/2014/05/28/the-worlds-most-powerful-women-2014/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2014, Bündchen was ranked No. 5 by ''Forbes Brasil'', as the 25 biggest celebrities in Brasil in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=25 maiores celebridades do Brasil em 2014 - Forbes Brasil |url=http://www.forbesbrasil.co/listas/15-maiores-celebridades-do-brasil-em-2014/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141204193653/http://www.forbesbrasil.co/listas/15-maiores-celebridades-do-brasil-em-2014/ |archivedate=4 December 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on media presence and overall influence, Bündchen ranked No. 2 biggest Brazilian celeb in 2015, according to Forbes Brasil.&lt;ref name="fashionweekdaily.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RANKING: 25 maiores celebridades do Brasil em 2015 - Forbes Brasil|url=https://www.forbes.com.br/listas/2015/11/25-maiores-celebridades-do-brasil-em-2015/#foto1/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170320015943/http://www.forbes.com.br/listas/2015/11/25-maiores-celebridades-do-brasil-em-2015/#foto1/|archivedate=20 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
In November 2002, Bündchen was paid a reported £320,000 and given two black mink coats by American fur company [[Blackglama]] to head its new advertising campaign. Activists from [[PETA]] (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals), invaded the runway during the Victoria's Secret show in New York and brandished placards saying "Gisele: fur scum". The Brazilian was one of the most prominent models to wear fur since it began to come back into acceptability in fashion circles. A PETA spokesperson said: "By getting into bed with the fur-pushers, Gisele has become PETA enemy number one. Every time that Gisele or anyone else wears furs they are sentencing countless animals to a violent and cruel death."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/1413381/Gisele-left-exposed-on-catwalk-by-fur-protest.html|title=Gisele left exposed on catwalk by fur protest|publisher=[[The Sunday Telegraph]]|date=16 November 2002|accessdate=13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2010, she was criticized after saying that breastfeeding should be law. She told ''[[Harper's Bazaar|Harper's Bazaar UK]]'', "Some people here [in the U.S.] think they don't have to breastfeed, and I think 'Are you going to give chemical food to your child when they are so little?'...I think there should be a worldwide law, in my opinion, that mothers should breastfeed their babies for six months."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/7927001/Gisele-Bundchen-forced-to-apologise-over-breastfeeding-comments.html|title=Gisele Bundchen forced to apologise over breastfeeding comments|publisher=[[The Sunday Telegraph]]|date=4 August 2010|accessdate=13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bündchen later posted a statement on her blog saying, "My intention in making a comment about the importance of breastfeeding has nothing to do with the law. It comes from my passionate beliefs about children. Being a new mom has brought a lot of questions. I feel like I am in a constant search for answers on what might be the best for my child. It's unfortunate that in an interview sometimes things can seem so black and white."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=If Only All Moms Could Breastfeed Like Gisele|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/10/gisele-breastfeeding-instagram_n_4421101.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2011, she infuriated cancer experts when she said of sunscreen: "I cannot put this poison on my skin...I do not use anything synthetic." The statement was made as she launched her own organic skin care line Sejaa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gisele: Sunscreen Is 'Poison'|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/02/04/gisele-sunscreen-poison_n_818704.html|publisher=[[Huffington Post]]|date=4 February 2011|accessdate=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1353581/Gisele-Bundchen-angers-cancer-experts-saying-sun-cream-poison.html|title=It's poison: Gisele Bundchen angers cancer experts by saying people shouldn't wear sun lotion|publisher=[[Daily Mail]]|date=4 February 2011|accessdate=13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bündchen has made advertising for [[Nivea|Nivea Sun]] in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newsvideo/celebrity-news-video/8301406/Gisele-Bundchens-Nivea-Sun-commercial.html|title=Gisele Bundchen's Nivea Sun commercial|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=3 February 2011|accessdate=13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bündchen's publicist Amber Clapp added, telling StyleList:
"Gisele would never say not to use sunscreen because she has had family members who have had skin cancer. She simply stated that her all-natural skin-care line does not have SPF because there is not an all natural SPF available....When using sunscreens, she selects ones that are free of parabens, oxybenzone, PABA and retinyl palmitate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gisele Clarifies Sunscreen Comments|url=http://www.mindbodygreen.com/0-1976/Gisele-Clarifies-Sunscreen-Comments.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, Ted Southern, former designer of [[Victoria's Secret]] Angels' wings, revealed that Gisele was difficult to work with; "She's really tough," he said. "She's always screaming, 'What the f--k is this?'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/news-features/TMG8433946/Gisele-Bundchen-is-no-angel.html|title=Gisele Bündchen is no 'angel'|work=Telegraph|date=7 April 2011|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, a lingerie TV ad starring Bündchen in Brazil, was deemed "offensive and sexist" by the Brazilian government department for policies for women, which called for the ad to be banned, saying in a statement that the campaign "reinforce the wrong stereotypes of the woman as a husband's mere sex object and ignore the great advances we've achieved in deconstructing sexist thoughts and practices." The secretariat petitioned the National Council for Advertising Self-Regulation (known by its Portuguese acronym CONAR), to open an investigation into whether the campaign was sexist, and CONAR accepted the request.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2096771,00.html|title=Gisele's Sexist TV Ad?

Women were taught to use their charm and sexy lingerie to control their husbands in the ads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/sep/30/gisele-bundchen-sexist-lingerie-ads-brazil|title=Gisele's sexist lingerie ads are no laughing matter in Brazil|work=Telegraph|date=30 September 2011|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2012, after the Patriots lost in [[Super Bowl XLVI]] and Bündchen was heckled by several [[New York Giants]] fans, she was caught on video saying, "My husband cannot fucking throw the ball and catch the ball at the same time!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Video of Super Bowl XLVI comment|url=http://www.nypost.com/video?vcid=23569919&amp;freewheel=90861&amp;sitesection=nypostns |date = 5 February 2012 |work=New York Post|accessdate =10 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/gisele-bundchen-tells-tom-brady-played-best-game-life-slamming-patriots-article-1.1018579?localLinksEnabled=false | title = Super Bowl XLVI comment | date = 7 February 2012 |work=Daily News |location=New York | accessdate =10 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The comment, which was widely publicized both in the traditional media&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/entertainment/2012/02/gisele-bundchen-curses-tom-bradys-super-bowl-loss/ |title=Gisele Bundchen Curses Tom Brady's Super Bowl Loss |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=6 February 2012 |accessdate=24 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.nydailynews.com/2012-02-06/news/31031995_1_patriots-locker-room-tom-brady-ball "Gisele Bundchen slams Patriots receivers?"] ''Daily News'' (New York). 6 February 2012.

In November 2012, Bündchen was criticized by doctors and mothers after making a post in her website claiming that hospital birth is "violence against women and babies".

In January 2014, the model was criticized after being photographed in Costa Rica riding an [[All-terrain vehicle|ATV]] while carrying her 13-month-old daughter Vivian in one arm and without helmet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bostonmagazine.com/arts-entertainment/blog/2014/01/14/gisele-bundchen-carries-baby-riding-four-wheeler-costa-rica/|title=Gisele Bundchen Takes Baby on Four-Wheeler with No Helmets|publisher=Boston Magazine|date=14 January 2014 |accessdate=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was slammed for what many called "dangerous behavior".

On 13 March 2013, when Vivian was just 3 months old, she was photographed doing the same thing.

Bündchen told ''Vitals'' magazine in 2005 that she has been involved in business and investing in real estate since she was 18 years old.

On 1 May 2007, it was announced that Bündchen had ended her contract with Victoria's Secret.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Triggs |first=Charlotte |url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20037350,00.html |title=Gisele Bündchen, Victoria's Secret Part Ways |work=People |date=1 May 2007 |accessdate=3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a stock market analysis in 2007, when Bündchen terminated her agreement with Victoria's Secret, which is owned by [[L Brands|Limited Brands]], Limited was selling for $26.80 per share.
