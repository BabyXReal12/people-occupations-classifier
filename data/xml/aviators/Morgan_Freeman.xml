==Career==

===Acting career===
Although his first credited film appearance was in 1971's ''Who Says I Can't Ride a Rainbow?'', Freeman first became known in the American media through roles on the soap opera ''[[Another World (TV series)|Another World]]'' and the [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] kids' show ''[[The Electric Company]]''&lt;ref name="actors"/&gt; (notably as Easy Reader, Mel Mounds the DJ, and Vincent the Vegetable Vampire&lt;sup&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c99NfY7S1aA &lt;nowiki&gt;[clip]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt;).

[[Joan Ganz Cooney]] claims that Freeman regrets doing ''The Electric Company'', saying "it was a very unhappy period in his life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOAXUuT205s|title=Joan Ganz Cooney discusses the beginnings of "The Electric Company"- EMMYTVLEGENDS|date=October 21, 2011|work=YouTube|accessdate=August 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Freeman himself admitted in an interview that he never thinks about his tenure with the show, but he acknowledged that, contrary to Cooney’s claims, he was glad to have been a part of it.&lt;ref name=street&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JezWgZV7P6A|title=Morgan Freeman talks 'Street Smart', winning an Oscar and reveals that acting isn't hard|date=August 21, 2014|work=YouTube|accessdate=August 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since then, Freeman has considered his ''[[Street Smart (film)|Street Smart]]'' (1987) character Fast Black, rather than any of the characters he played in ''The Electric Company'', to be his [[breakthrough role]].&lt;ref name=street/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIno3CaFjPg|title=Morgan Freeman Talks About His Big Career Break|date=April 7, 2011|work=YouTube|accessdate=August 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the mid-1980s, Freeman began playing prominent supporting roles in many feature films, earning him a reputation for depicting wise, fatherly characters.&lt;ref name="actors"/&gt; As he gained fame, he went on to bigger roles in films such as the chauffeur Hoke in ''Driving Miss Daisy'', and Sergeant Major Rawlins in ''[[Glory (1989 film)|Glory]]'' (both in 1989).&lt;ref name="actors"/&gt; In 1994, he portrayed Red, the redeemed convict in the acclaimed ''[[The Shawshank Redemption]]''. In the same year he was a member of the jury at the [[44th Berlin International Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="Berlinale 1994"&gt;{{cite web |title=Berlinale: 1994 Juries |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1994/04_jury_1994/04_Jury_1994.html |accessdate=June 9, 2011 |website=berlinale.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Morgan Freeman - Discovery Shoot (6559314831).jpg|left|upright|Freeman in December 2008|thumb]]
He also starred in such films as ''[[Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves]]'', ''[[Unforgiven]]'', ''[[Seven (1995 film)|Seven]]'', and ''[[Deep Impact (film)|Deep Impact]]''.

Freeman also hosts the channel ''Our Space'' on ClickStar, with specially crafted film clips in which he shares his love for the sciences, especially space exploration and aeronautics.

After three previous nominations - a [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] nomination for ''Street Smart'', and [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] nominations for ''Driving Miss Daisy'' and ''The Shawshank Redemption''—he won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in ''[[Million Dollar Baby]]'' at the [[77th Academy Awards]].&lt;ref name="actors"/&gt; Freeman is recognized for his distinctive voice, making him a frequent choice for narration. In 2005 alone, he provided narration for two films, ''[[War of the Worlds (2005 film)|War of the Worlds]]'' and the [[Academy Award]]-winning documentary film ''[[March of the Penguins]]''.

Freeman appeared as [[God in Christianity|God]] in the hit film ''[[Bruce Almighty]]'' and its sequel, ''[[Evan Almighty]]''.

===Comments on racism===
In 2005, Freeman criticized the celebration of [[Black History Month]], saying, "I don't want a black history month. Black history is American history."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; He opined that the only way to end racism is to stop talking about it, and he noted that there is no "white history month."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|first=Isabelle|last=Khoo|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2017/02/10/morgan-freeman-black-history-month_n_14642958.html |title=Morgan Freeman Calls Black History Month 'Ridiculous' In Throwback Video |website=[[Huffington Post]]| |publisher=[[Huffington Post Media Group]] |location=New York City|date=February 10, 2017 |accessdate=May 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freeman once said in an interview with ''[[60 Minutes]]''{{'}}s [[Mike Wallace (journalist)|Mike Wallace]], "I am going to stop calling you a white man and I'm going to ask you to stop calling me a black man."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snopes.com/politics/quotes/blackhistory.asp A verbatim transcript] of this segment of the Mike Wallace interview where Morgan Freeman suggests the abandonment of language that reinforces racism, is posted at the Snopes web site.&lt;/ref&gt; Freeman supported the defeated proposal to change the [[Flag of Mississippi|Mississippi state flag]], which contains the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] [[Rebel flag|battle flag]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first= David | last= Firestone| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/18/us/mississippi-votes-wide-margin-keep-state-flag-that-includes-confederate-emblem.html |title=Mississippi Votes by wide margin to keep state flag That includes Confederate emblem|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=New York Times Company|location=New York City|date=April 18, 2001|accessdate=April 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Carol|last=Kopp|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/12/14/60minutes/main1127684.shtml|title=Morgan Freeman defies labels |website=cbsnews.com |publisher=CBS News| date= December 18, 2005| accessdate=April 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freeman sparked controversy in 2011 when, on CNN's ''[[Piers Morgan Tonight]]'', he accused the [[Tea Party movement]] of racism.&lt;ref name="THRracist"&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/morgan-freeman-sparks-outcry-tea-party-racist-239872 |title=Morgan Freeman Sparks Outcry After Calling Tea Party Racist |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |publisher=[[Eldridge Industries]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date=September 24, 2011 |accessdate=January 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2011/09/24/morgan-freeman-calls-tea-party-racist/ |title=Morgan Freeman Calls Tea Party 'Racist' (Video) |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |publisher=Dow Jones &amp; Company|location=New York City|date=September 24, 2011 |accessdate=January 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=David|last=Jackson|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/theoval/post/2011/09/obama-backer-attacks-rooted-in-race/1 |title=Obama backer: Some attacks are 'a racist thing' |work=[[USA Today]] |publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|location=McLean, Virginia|date=September 25, 2011 |accessdate=January 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In reaction to the [[death of Freddie Gray]] and the [[2015 Baltimore protests]], Freeman said he was "absolutely" supportive of the protesters. "That unrest [in Baltimore] has nothing to do with terrorism at all, except the terrorism we suffer from the police. [...] Because of the technology—everybody has a smartphone—now we can see what the police are doing. We can show the world, Look, this is what happened in that situation. So why are so many people dying in police custody? And why are they all black? And why are all the police killing them white? What is that? The police have always said, 'I feared for my safety.' Well, now we know. OK. You feared for your safety while a guy was running away from you, right?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Zach|last=Schonfeld|url=http://www.newsweek.com/morgan-freeman-baltimore-and-terrorism-we-suffer-police-327300|title=Morgan Freeman on Baltimore and the ‘Terrorism We Suffer From the Police’|work=[[Newsweek]]|publisher=IBT Media|location=New York City|date=April 30, 2015|accessdate=August 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
