'''Kimberly Anyadike''' (born 1994) is a pilot from [[Compton, California]]. In 2009, at the age of 15, she became the youngest [[Nigerian]] American woman to complete a [[transcontinental flight]] across the United States, from [[Los Angeles, California]] to [[Newport News, Virginia]]. Anyadike was accompanied by an adult safety pilot, and by a retired Air Force pilot who had served with the WWII [[Tuskegee Airmen]]. Her plane was autographed by about 50 Tuskegee airmen as she stopped at different cities across the US, and she completed the round-trip journey in a single-engine [[Cessna 172]] in 13 days. In 2015, Anyadike received the first [[Young Aviator's Award]] from the Tuskegee Airmen in recognition of her achievements. In 2016, she graduated from the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] with an undergraduate degree.

== Early life  ==
Born in 1994, Anyadike grew up in Compton, California.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://milwaukeecourieronline.com/index.php/2015/07/04/compton-15-year-old-became-the-youngest-african-american-female-to-pilot-plane-cross-country/|title=Compton 15-Year-Old Became the Youngest African American Female to Pilot Plane Cross-Country {{!}} Milwaukee Courier Weekly Newspaper|website=milwaukeecourieronline.com|language=en|access-date=2017-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has an older brother and sister.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Her parents are originally from [[Nigeria]],&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201508172091.html|title=Nigeria: Kimberly Anyadike – First African-American Teen to Fly Across the United States|last=Ogunsina|first=Bukola|date=2015-08-17|work=Leadership (Abuja)|access-date=2017-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their surname Anyadike means "eye of the warrior" in the [[Igbo language|Igbo]] language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://amazingafrica.planetfem.com/kimberly-anyadike/|title=Amazing Young Africans: Kimberly Anyadike|date=2015-08-09|work=Amazing Africa – African inspired fashion, design and style|access-date=2017-07-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://newsofnigeria.com/kimberly-anyadike-the-nigerian-the-first-female-african-american-teen-to-fly-an-airplane/|title=Kimberly Anyadike the Nigerian, the first Female African-American Teen to Fly an Airplane|website=newsofnigeria.com|access-date=2017-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anyadike took dance lessons at the Lula Washington Dance Academy, served as a junior lifeguard at [[Venice beach|Venice Beach]] for five years, and volunteered as a youth leader at her local church.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; At a young age, she showed a strong interest in medical science and anatomy; her mother taught her to identify and name all 206 bones in the body. Anyadike later attended science classes at the [[Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science|Charles Drew University]] Saturday Science Academy, an L.A.-based [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] subjects program for youth ranging in age from preschool to grade 12.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Aviation training ==
Anyadike took her first flying lessons at the age of 12, attending an after-school aviation program offered by [[Tomorrow's Aeronautical Museum]] for disadvantaged youths.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/kimberly-anyadike-15-youngest-african-american-female-pilot-plane-cross-country-article-1.399825|title=Kimberly Anyadike, 15, becomes youngest African American female to pilot plane cross-country|date=14 July 2009|publisher=[[New York Daily News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wn.com/kimberly_anyadike_on_cnn_with_kiran_chetry|title=Kimberly Anyadike On Cnn With Kiran Chetry|website=World News|language=en|access-date=2017-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was inspired to take lessons after reading about [[Jonathan Strickland]], an earlier participant of the program who became the youngest person to fly a fixed-wing aircraft and a helicopter solo in a single day.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Anyadike paid for her flight lessons with "museum dollars" earned by washing airplanes and working odd jobs around the Compton Airport.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; As part of the program's requirements, she maintained a strong academic record throughout the period.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Despite having a fear of heights, Anyadike says that being in the cockpit of a plane is "an amazing experience".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Transcontinental flight ==
As Anyadike gradually built up 100 hours of flight time, she conceived the idea of flying across the country.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2009-10-01|title=A Dream Takes Wing!|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-1864342901.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; She wanted to inspire other youth, while also honouring the [[Tuskegee Airmen]], an African-American air combat unit that served during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Departing on June 29, 2009,&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; 15-year-old Anyadike flew a single-engine [[Cessna 172]] from Compton, California to [[Newport News, Virginia]] and back, completing the journey in 13 days.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://newsroom.ucla.edu/stories/ucla-senior-has-a-new-flight-plan|title=UCLA senior has a new flight plan|last=Kendall|first=Rebecca|website=UCLA Newsroom|language=en|access-date=2017-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; She was accompanied by adult safety pilot Ronnell Norman, and Major Levi H. Thornhill, an 87-year-old retired [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] pilot who had served as a member of the Tuskegee Airmen.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
[[File:Cessna 172 on final (558933903).jpg|left|thumb|A Cessna 172 aircraft]]
Anyadike made at least a dozen scheduled stops along the way, and navigated through thunderstorms as she flew across Texas.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2009/07/teenage-girl-flies-a-plane-across-the-county.html|title=Teen becomes youngest African American female to complete flight across U.S.|date=2009-07-11|website=LA Times Blogs – L.A. NOW|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Washington, D.C.]], Congresswoman [[Laura Richardson]] came to congratulate the young pilot, and in [[Tuskegee, Alabama]], Mayor Omar Neal proclaimed July 2 to be "Kimberly Anyadike Day".&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2009-07-23|title=15 year-old girl has made history by flying 'sea to shining sea'|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-1830974491.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; During stops in different cities, Anyadike's plane was autographed by about 50 different Tuskegee Airmen.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Major Thornhill acted as Anyadike's representative to make the necessary introductions with regional chapters of the airmen.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Although the record had never been officially tracked before her journey,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2009-07-12|title=Young pilot's trip across country honors history.(Front)|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-203437537.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anyadike is considered the youngest black American woman — and possibly the youngest person of any race or gender — to have successfully piloted a plane coast-to-coast across the United States.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Upon her arrival home on July 11, 2009, Anyadike received an award from the [[County of Los Angeles]], and was personally invited by [[Arnold Schwarzenegger|Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger]] to visit the [[California State Capitol]].&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; In May 2015, Anyadike received the Tuskegee Airmen's inaugural Young Aviator's Award in Tuskegee, Alabama, in recognition of her achievements as a pilot.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 2017, Anyadike was interviewed about her transcontinental flight for a special [[Disney Channel]] segment for [[Black History Month]] entitled 'True Heroes Are Timeless'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.essence.com/entertainment/disney-channel-launches-black-history-month-programming|title=First Look: Disney Channel Launches 'Be Inspired' Programming For Black History Month|date=2017-02-01|work=Essence.com|access-date=2017-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.twistmagazine.com/posts/nathaniel-potvin-s-black-history-month-video-for-disney-channel-at-tomorrow-s-aeronautical-museum-124538/photos/nathaniel-potvin-230073?age_gate%5Bbirth_year%5D=|title=Nathaniel Potvin Shares About His Experience Working On Disney Channel's New Black History Month Feature|date=2017-02-02|work=Twist|access-date=2017-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://goodblacknews.org/tag/floyd-norman/|title=Floyd Norman {{!}} GOOD BLACK NEWS|website=goodblacknews.org|language=en|access-date=2017-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== College education ==
For her college education, Anyadike enrolled at the [[University of California, Los Angeles|University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)]], majoring in physiological science with minors in African-American studies and Spanish. During her senior year, she was also working as a registered emergency medical technician, and was volunteering for her local chapter of the [[The Flying Samaritans|Flying Samaritans]] to bring medical care to [[Tijuana]], [[Mexico]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She graduated with her undergraduate degree from UCLA in June 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://newsroom.ucla.edu/stories/ucla-graduates-of-2016-are-told-that-the-world-needs-you|title=UCLA graduates are told ‘the world needs you’|last=Hewitt|first=Alison|website=UCLA Newsroom|language=en|access-date=2017-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked about future aspirations, Anyadike has said that she plans to enroll in medical school and become a cardiovascular surgeon.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Family ==
Anyadike's older sister, Kelly, also took aviation lessons at Tomorrow's Aeronautical Museum.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 2008, on her sixteenth birthday, Kelly became the youngest African-American woman to pilot four different fixed-wing aircraft in a single day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://now.biola.edu/news/article/2012/mar/06/kelly-anyadike-pilots-her-way-guiness-book-world-r/|title=Kelly Anyadike pilots her way into the Guinness Book of World Records|access-date=2017-07-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://milwaukeecourieronline.com/index.php/2012/02/25/the-sky-is-no-longer-the-limit-six-world-records-set-at-16-years-old/|title=The sky is no longer the limit, six world records set at 16 years-old {{!}} Milwaukee Courier Weekly Newspaper|website=milwaukeecourieronline.com|language=en|access-date=2017-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In interviews, Anyadike has said that a friendly rivalry with Kelly helped inspire her to complete her own piloting achievements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2011-10-01|title=Planes on the brain.(Kimberly and Kelly Anyadike)|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-272444769.html|journal=Faces: People, Places, and Cultures}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
