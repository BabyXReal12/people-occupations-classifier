'''Paul Moyer''' (born June 13, 1941)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.californiabirthindex.org/birth/paul_douglas_moir_born_1941_2375385|website=California Birth Index|title=California Birth Records|accessdate=March 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an American [[Journalism|journalist]]. He co-anchored the 5 PM and 11 PM weekday editions of [[KNBC-TV]]'s ''Channel 4 News'' with [[Colleen Williams]]. Moyer has worked primarily in the two major television markets—[[New York City|New York]] and [[Los Angeles]]—in addition to briefly working on network newscasts.  Moyer was Los Angeles' longest-running news anchor following the death of [[KTLA]] anchor [[Hal Fishman]] on August 7, 2007. He is married and has four children, Elise, Paul, Dylan and Kyle.

On April 1, 2009, KNBC's [[Colleen Williams]] announced, during the evening newscast, that Moyer had decided to retire after 25 years at the station.&lt;ref name=LAT&gt;[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2009/04/veteran-anchor-paul-moyer-is-retiring-from-knbc-where-he-has-been-the-main-face-of-the-news-room-for-nearly-a-quarter-centur.html' KNBC-TV Channel 4 anchor Paul Moyer to retire]&lt;/ref&gt; Moyer's salary was estimated at more than $3 million a year of his time of retirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2009/scene/markets-festivals/knbc-s-paul-moyer-set-to-retire-1118001997/ |date=1 April 2009|accessdate=2018-05-02|title=KNBC's Paul Moyer Set to Retire}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980 he was earning $250,000, and by 1993 it was cut to $1 million per annum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1997-06-06/entertainment/ca-526_1_salary-disclosure Moyer's salaries]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 he sold the family home worth $9.5 million to buy a more modest retirement home in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMB3we2ni98 Paul Moyer's retirement]&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.latimes.com/business/realestate/la-hm-hotprop-paul-moyer-20110803-story.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career==
Moyer was born in Los Angeles. He attended [[Torrance High School]] and the [[University of Arizona]] (class of 1964), and tried out for the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]], before beginning a broadcasting career. He served positions at [[KTIV]] in [[Sioux City, Iowa]], [[WMBD-TV]] and [[WMBD (AM)|WMBD radio]] in [[Peoria, Illinois]], [[KTVI]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], [[KDKA-TV]] and [[KDKA (AM)|KDKA]] radio in [[Pittsburgh]], and then [[WCBS-TV]] in [[New York City]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schneider|first=Michael|title=KNBC’s Paul Moyer set to retire|url=https://variety.com/2009/scene/news/knbc-s-paul-moyer-set-to-retire-1118001997/|publisher=Variety|accessdate=March 26, 2014|date=April 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; before returning to Los Angeles and joining KNBC in March 1972 as reporter and weekend anchor. The ''KNBC Newservice'', as it was known, then featured [[Jess Marlow]], [[Tom Snyder]], and [[Tom Brokaw]] as the main nightly anchors and was the first serious competition in the local news ratings against [[KCBS-TV|KNXT]]'s ''The Big News'' with [[Jerry Dunphy]].  Moyer soon moved to the 11 p.m. newscast in July 1973 and to the 6 p.m. newscast in December 1974 with the respective departures of Brokaw and Snyder (the latter instance followed the addition of [[John Schubeck]] to the late news).

Moyer would anchor at KNBC and host its ''Sunday'' program, in both cases working alongside longtime KNBC anchorwoman [[Kelly Lange]].  However, after the station relieved him of his anchor duties, he moved over to rival [[KABC-TV]] in 1979 initially as a "special correspondent" for ''Eyewitness News''.  Soon, however, when the weekday operation expanded to three hours in the early evening in the fall of 1980, Moyer was named co-anchor of the 5 p.m. hour with [[Ann Martin (journalist)|Ann Martin]].  He soon replaced Dunphy (who had moved to KABC in 1975) on the 11 p.m. news after the latter was shot during a robbery attempt near the studio in 1983; the appointment would become permanent a year later.

==Career==
Moyer was a visible face on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] network in the mid-1980s, appearing as a correspondent on ''Eye on Hollywood'' and substituting on ''World News This Morning'' and ''[[Good Morning America]]''.  But in 1992, after a highly publicized bidding war, Moyer returned to KNBC in July 1992 to co-anchor with longtime [[San Francisco]] anchorwoman-journalist [[Wendy Tokuda]].  However, when ratings failed to surpass KABC's, Moyer was once again paired with Lange; both received a seven-figure salary. According to a June 2007 article in ''Los Angeles Magazine'', Moyer's salary was rumored to be closer to $8 million.

Moyer appeared as himself on the TV show ''[[The West Wing (TV series)|The West Wing]]'' while doing an election-night stint for [[MSNBC]].  His nephew, Micah Ohlman, had anchored the weekend newscasts at rival KABC and is now anchoring at [[KTLA]]. He was at one time designated the honorary mayor of [[West Los Angeles]].

Moyer is known as an avid car collector, particularly interested in [[Ferrari]] cars, Ford GTs, and other sports cars.  He won the [[Toyota Pro/Celebrity Race]] in 1988.

On April 30, 1992, he toured Los Angeles in a helicopter to observe damage from the [[1992 Los Angeles riots|Los Angeles riots]].

In April 2009, Moyer announced that he would be retiring from KNBC where he had been a fixture for over 30 years.

==In popular culture==
The morning duo [[Kevin and Bean]] on [[KROQ-FM]] made fun of Moyer on a regular basis for his presentation style and alleged behind-the-scenes temper. An audio tape from the early 1990s&lt;ref name=LAObserved&gt;[http://www.laobserved.com/archive/2004/12/catfight_at_cha.php Catfight at Channel 7]&lt;/ref&gt; features Moyer verbally berating [[Ann Martin (journalist)|Ann Martin]] when they anchored together just seconds before the newscast began.  The audio tape references Moyer bad-mouthing rival anchor [[Harold Greene (journalist)|Harold Greene]] while accusing Martin of drinking before the newscast.  Moyer suggests the two should take up their issues with [[Roger Bell]], KABC-TV's News Director.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aprilwinchell.com/media/audio/PaulMoyer_AnnMartin.mp3 Tape of the exchange]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, Moyer had a short-lived stint as Bill Cosby's replacement as the face of Jell-O pudding snacks.

In May 2006, Moyer led an investigation on the rapidly increasing Chemtrail/Weather modification problem in Southern California. His four-minute report ''Toxic Sky'', produced for KNBC in Los Angeles, went viral on the Internet almost as soon as it was posted to their official website NBC4.TV (now nbclosangeles.com).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNDMJCTFslw ''Toxic Sky'' Part 1]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ev8AMhkesuo ''Toxic Sky'' Part 2]&lt;/ref&gt;
