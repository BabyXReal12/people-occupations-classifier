[[The Honourable]] '''Charles Stewart Rolls''' (27 August 1877 – 12 July 1910) was a Welsh motoring and aviation pioneer. Together with [[Henry Royce]] he co-founded the [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]] car manufacturing firm. He was the first Briton to be killed in an aeronautical accident with a powered aircraft, when the tail of his [[Wright Model A|Wright Flyer]] broke off during a flying display in the [[Southbourne, Dorset|Southbourne]] district of [[Bournemouth]]. He was aged 32.

==Early life==
[[File:Charles Rolls driving medal at Monmouth Museum, Wales.JPG|thumb|right|150px|Driving medals won by Rolls, at [[Monmouth Museum]]]]
Rolls was born in [[Berkeley Square]], London, third son of the [[John Rolls, 1st Baron Llangattock|1st Baron Llangattock]] and [[Lady Llangattock]]. Despite his London birth, he retained a strong family connection with his ancestral home&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/372038 | title=The Hendre | publisher=Geograph Britain and Ireland | accessdate=29 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[The Hendre]], near [[Monmouth]], Wales. After attending Mortimer Vicarage [[Preparatory school (UK)|Preparatory School]] in Berkshire, he was educated at [[Eton College]] where his developing interest in engines earned him the nickname ''dirty Rolls''.&lt;ref name="The_Magic_Of_A_Name"&gt;{{cite book | last = Pugh | first = Peter | title = The Magic of a Name – The Rolls-Royce Story: The First 40 Years | publisher = Icon Books | year = 2001 | isbn = 1-84046-151-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1894 he attended a private [[Cram school|crammer]] in Cambridge which helped him gain entry to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], where he studied mechanical and applied science. In 1896, at the age of 18, he travelled to Paris to buy his first car, a [[Peugeot]] [[Phaeton body|Phaeton]], and joined the [[French Automobile Club|Automobile Club of France]]. His Peugeot is believed to have been the first car based in Cambridge, and one of the first three cars owned in Wales. An early motoring enthusiast, he joined the Self-Propelled Traffic Association, which campaigned against the restrictions imposed on motor vehicles by the [[Locomotive Act]], and became a founder member of the [[Royal Automobile Club|Automobile Club of Great Britain]], with which the Association merged in 1897.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Vance | first = James | title = Ways of the World: A History of the World's Roads and of the Vehicles That Used Them | publisher = Rutgers University Press | year = 1992 | isbn = 0-8135-2691-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rolls was a keen cyclist and spent time at Cambridge bicycle racing. In 1896, he won a [[Blue (university sport)|Half Blue]] and the following year became captain of the Cambridge University Bicycle Club.&lt;ref name=TT39323&gt;Aeroplane Accident, Mr Rolls Killed at Bournemouth. ''The Times'', Wednesday, Jul 13, 1910; pg. 12; Issue 39323&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Bicycle, 15 July 1942, pG. Rolls won a half-blue because cycling was not considered a full sport. Rolls also had a collection of bicycles from solos up to four-man tandems.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rolls graduated from Cambridge in 1898 and began working on the [[steam yacht]] ''Santa Maria'' followed by a position at the [[London and North Western Railway]] in [[Crewe]].&lt;ref name="The_Magic_Of_A_Name"/&gt; However, his talents lay more in salesmanship and motoring pioneering than practical engineering; in January 1903, with the help of £6,600 provided by his father, he started one of Britain's first car dealerships,&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; C.S.Rolls &amp; Co. based in [[Fulham]], to import and sell French [[Peugeot]] and Belgian [[Minerva (automobile)|Minerva]] vehicles.
&lt;!--Rolls was a tall man, standing at about 1.95 m (6'5"). no citation, unable to verify--&gt;

==Partnership with Royce==
[[File:Panhard &amp; Levassor autocar, C S Rolls driver and George V.jpg|thumb|right|235px|[[George V of the United Kingdom|HRH The Duke of York]], Lord and Lady Llangattock, Sir Charles Cust and the Hon. C.S. Rolls at 'The Hendre', 1900]]
{{Main|Rolls-Royce Limited}}

Rolls was introduced to [[Henry Royce]] by a friend at the [[Royal Automobile Club]], Henry Edmunds, who was also a director of Royce Ltd. Edmunds showed him Royce's car and arranged the historic meeting between Rolls and Royce at the [[Midland Hotel (Manchester)|Midland Hotel]], Manchester, on 4 May 1904. In spite of his preference for three or four cylinder cars, Rolls was impressed with the two-cylinder Royce 10 and in a subsequent agreement of 23 December 1904 agreed to take all the cars Royce could make. These would be of two, three, four and six cylinders and would be badged as Rolls-Royces.

[[File:CharlesRolls.jpg|thumb|left|123px|Bronze bust at [[Derby Industrial Museum]]]]
The first Rolls-Royce car, the [[Rolls-Royce 10 hp]], was unveiled at the [[Paris Motor Show|Paris Salon]] in December 1904, although in the early advertising it was the name of Rolls that was emphasised over that of Royce. In 1906 Rolls and Royce formalised their partnership by creating Rolls-Royce Limited, with Rolls appointed Technical managing director on a salary of £750 per annum plus 4% of the profits in excess of £10,000. Rolls provided the financial backing and business acumen to complement Royce's technical expertise. In 1907 Rolls-Royce Limited bought out C.S. Rolls &amp; Co.

Rolls put much effort into publicising the quietness and smoothness of the Rolls-Royce, and at the end of 1906 travelled to the USA to promote the new cars. The company was winning awards for the quality and reliability of its cars by 1907. But by 1909 Rolls' interest in the business was waning, and at the end of the year he resigned as Technical managing director and became a [[non-executive director]].&lt;ref name="The_Magic_Of_A_Name"/&gt;

[[File:The late C.S. Rolls and Hon. Mrs Assheton Harbord.jpg|thumb|C. S. Rolls in a balloon probably his 'Midget']]
==Pioneer aviator==
Rolls was also a pioneer aviator and initially, balloonist,&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Charles Rolls|publisher=''[[BBC]]''|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/southeast/halloffame/historical_figures/charles_rolls.shtml|accessdate=29 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; making over 170 balloon ascents. In 1903 he won the [[James Gordon Bennett Jr.|Gordon Bennett]] Gold Medal for the longest single flight time.

By 1907 Rolls' interest turned increasingly to flying and he tried to persuade Royce to design an aero engine. He became the second Englishman to go up in an aeroplane. Piloted by  [[Wilbur Wright]] their flight on 8 October 1908 from Camp d'Auvours, eleven kilometres east of [[Le Mans]], lasted four minutes and twenty seconds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cabangu.com.br/pai_da_aviacao/9-luso/wrigth/Flight%20Log%201908%20Camp%20d%27Auvours,%20Le%20Mans,%20France.htm "U.S Centennial of Flight Commission: Wilbur &amp; Orville Wright: A Chronology"].Flight Log 1908 Camp d'Auvours, Le Mans, France.Retrieved 25 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt; He bought one of six [[Wright Model A|Wright Flyer]] aircraft built by [[Short Brothers]] under licence from the [[Wright Brothers]] and from early October 1909&lt;ref name="The_Magic_Of_A_Name"/&gt; made more than 200 flights.

==Death==
[[File:Death of Charles Stewart Rolls - Illustrated London News 2.jpg|thumb|right|Photograph on the front page of the Illustrated London News, 16 July 1910, showing the wreckage of the plane crash which killed Rolls]]
On 12 July 1910, at the age of 32, Rolls was killed in an air crash at Hengistbury Airfield,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.hengistbury-head.co.uk/history20.htm | title=Hengistbury Head in the 20th Century | publisher=Hengistbury Head | accessdate=29 June 2011 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110920111139/http://www.hengistbury-head.co.uk/history20.htm | archivedate=20 September 2011 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Southbourne, [[Bournemouth]] when the tail of his [[Wright Model A|Wright Flyer]] broke off during a flying display. He was the first Briton to be killed in an aeronautical accident with a powered aircraft, and the eleventh person internationally. His was also the first powered aviation fatality in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=TT39323/&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;"Mr. Rolls is the tenth airman who has met with a fatal accident in a motor-driven flying machine, and he is the first Englishman who has sacrificed his life in the cause of modern aviation." (Aeroplane Accident, Mr Rolls Killed at Bournemouth. ''The Times'', Wednesday, Jul 13, 1910; pg. 12; Issue 39323)&lt;/ref&gt; 

A [[Statue of Charles Rolls, Monmouth|statue]] in his memory, in which he is seen holding a biplane model, was erected in Agincourt Square, [[Monmouth]]. A further memorial to him was unveiled in 1981 in the bottom playing field of [[St Peter's Catholic Comprehensive School|St Peter's School]], which was developed on the site of Hengistbury Airfield.

His grave lies at the churchyard of [[Church of St Cadoc, Llangattock Vibon Avel|St Cadoc's Church]], [[Llangattock-Vibon-Avel]], where many of the Rolls family lie buried in various family tombs. His grave is just below Llangattock Manor and bears the inscription:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
