In November 1896 she won the ''Course de 12 Jours'' (12-day race) in the [[Royal Aquarium]], [[London]], England,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sixday.org.uk/html/1896_london.html|title=1896 London|website=sixday.org.uk|access-date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and In August 1898 she won the ''Grand Prix d’Europe'' (Grand Prix of Europe). [[Leopold II of Belgium]] awarded Dutrieu the Cross of St André with diamonds in honour of her cycling success. She later became a motorcycle and [[Auto racing|automobile racer]].

=== Stuntwoman ===
She began performing in variety shows as a cycling [[music hall|speciality act]] and in July 1903 she cycled a loop inside a vertical track at the Eldorado in [[Marseille]], France. She also invented her own stunt, ''"La Flèche Humaine"'' (''"The Human Arrow"''), which was a c. 15 m jump with a bicycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k5782538p|title=L'Universel : magazine hebdomadaire illustré|date=1903-09-24|website=Gallica|access-date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1903 she appeared at l'Olympia, Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k7535526z|title=Gil Blas / dir.

=== Acting career ===
Hélène Dutrieu had played a small role at the [[Théâtre Déjazet|Déjazet theatre]] in 1903&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k550498k|title=La Presse|date=1903-01-30|website=Gallica|access-date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; (she played “''Hélène''” in “''Môssieu le Maire''“ by Gustave Stoskopf&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k549740|title=Les Annales du théâtre et de la musique / Édouard Noël et Edmond Stoullig|last=Noël|first=Édouard (1846-1926) Auteur du texte|last2=Stoullig|first2=Edmond (1845-1918) Auteur du texte|date=1903-01-01|website=Gallica|access-date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;). After regaining her health she went back to the theatre playing comedy in 1906-1909. She performed on stages such as [[Théâtre des Capucines]], Théâtre des Mathurins, Porte Saint-Martin and Théâtre Michel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k5702798f|title = La Semaine politique et littéraire de Paris / directeur : Jean Borghèse|date = 1913-01-12|website = Gallica|access-date = 2016-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Achievements in aviation===
[[Image:Hélène Dutrieu.jpg|thumb|left|Hélène Dutrieu in her aeroplane, c. 1911.]]

Dutrieu learned to fly using a [[Santos-Dumont Demoiselle]] [[monoplane]] in early 1910.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1910/1910%20-%200032.html|title=Flight International Flight, 8 January 1910, p.28.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 April 1910 she reputedly became the first woman pilot to fly with a passenger. On 25 November 1910 Dutrieu became the fourth woman in the world, and the first Belgian woman, licensed as an aeroplane pilot, receiving ''Aéro-Club de Belgique'' (Aero Club of Belgium) licence #27. Her appearances at air shows earned her the [[nickname]] the ''"Girl Hawk"''. There was a minor scandal early in her aviation career when it was revealed to the press that she did not wear a [[corset]] while flying.

She was also style conscious, wearing the first known high fashion pilot suit, designed by the Paris couturier Bernard &lt;ref&gt;''Les Modes'', March 1910&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1910 Dutrieu flew non-stop from [[Ostend]] to [[Bruges]], [[Belgium]]. From 26 September to 1 October she flew, frequently carrying passengers, at the aviation week in [[Burton-upon-Trent]], England. She was the first woman pilot to stay airborne for more than an hour and on 21 December 1910 she became the first winner of the ''[[Coupe Femina]]'' (Femina Cup) for a non-stop flight of 167&amp;nbsp;km in 2 hours 35 minutes. In 1911 she regained the ''[[Coupe Femina]]'' temporarily with a flight of 254&amp;nbsp;km in 2 hours 58 minutes but that year's cup was eventually won by [[Marie Marvingt]]. In September 1911 Dutrieu travelled to the United States with her [[Farman III]] [[biplane]]. She competed for the women's altitude record and the ''Rodman-Wanamaker trophy'', subsequently won by [[Matilde E. Moisant|Matilde Moisant]], at the Nassau Boulevard airfield meeting in [[Garden City, New York]]. In the same year Dutrieu beat 14 male pilots to win the ''Coppa del Re'' (King's Cup) in [[Florence]], [[Italy]]. In 1912 she reputedly became the first woman to pilot a [[seaplane]]. Later the same year she won a prize in competition against four other seaplane pilots, including [[Caudron|Réne Caudron]], at [[Ouchy]]-[[Lausanne]], [[Switzerland]]. In 1913 Dutrieu became the first woman aviator awarded membership of the ''[[Légion d'honneur]]'' (French Legion of Honour).

===World War I and afterward===
During [[World War I]] Dutrieu became an [[ambulance]] driver. Général Février put her in charge of the ambulances at Messimi Hospital. She later became the director of [[Val-de-Grâce|Campagne à Val-de Grâce military hospital]].  After the war she became a [[journalist]]. In 1922 she married Pierre Mortier and took French nationality. She later became vice president of the women’s section of the ''Aéro-Club de France'' (Aero Club of France). In 1953 she was awarded the [[Médaille de l'Aéronautique]] (French Medal for Aeronautics).{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} In 1956 she created the ''Coupe Hélène Dutrieu-Mortier'' (Hélène Dutrieu-Mortier Cup) with a prize of 200,000 francs for the French or Belgian woman pilot who made the longest non-stop flight each year.

===Death===
Hélène Dutrieu died in [[Paris]], France, on 26 June 1961, at the age of 83.&lt;ref name=ea&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.earlyaviators.com/edutrieu.htm |title=Helene Dutrieu, Aviator, Is Dead.

She was born at Tournai on 10 July 1877. Like so many of the other early female aviators, she was a sportswoman who took up flying as a new sport. She lived in Paris, where she was a music-hall performer. Further, she was a champion on the bicycle, holding several speed records, including those of 1897-1999. ...  |publisher=Ralph Cooper }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=French Pioneer Flier Won Legion of Honor in 1913 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1961/06/28/archives/helene-dutrieu-aviator-is-dead-french-pioneer-flier-won-legion-of.html |quote=Helene Dutrieu, pioneer woman aviator, died yesterday at the age of 84. |publisher=[[New York Times]] |date=28 June 1961 |accessdate=2008-06-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
