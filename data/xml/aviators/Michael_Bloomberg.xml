He has joined [[The Giving Pledge]], whereby billionaires pledge to give away at least half of their wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704017904575409713589040490|title=Mayor Pledges Wealth|last=Banjo|first=Shelly|date=2010-08-05|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=2017-04-22|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bloomberg is the founder, CEO, and owner of [[Bloomberg L.P.]], a global financial services, mass media, and software company that bears his name, and is notable for its [[Bloomberg Terminal]], a computer software system providing financial data widely used in the global financial services industry. He began his career at the securities brokerage [[Salomon Brothers]], before forming his own company in 1981 and spending the next twenty years as its chairman and CEO. Bloomberg also served as chairman of the board of trustees at his alma mater, [[Johns Hopkins University]], from 1996 to 2002.

Bloomberg has served as the [[List of mayors of New York City|108th]] [[Mayor of New York City]], holding office for three consecutive terms, beginning with [[New York City mayoral election, 2001|his first election in 2001]]. A [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] before seeking elective office, Bloomberg switched his party registration in 2001 to run for mayor as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]. He defeated opponent [[Mark J. Green|Mark Green]] in a close election held just weeks after the [[September 11 terrorist attacks]]. He won a second term in 2005, and left the Republican Party two years later. Bloomberg campaigned to change the city's term limits law, and was elected to his third term in 2009 as an [[Independent (politician)|Independent candidate]] on the Republican ballot line.

Bloomberg was frequently mentioned as a possible [[centrist]] candidate for the U.S. Presidential elections in [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008]], and [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012]], as well as for Governor of New York in [[New York gubernatorial election, 2010|2010]]. He declined to seek either office, opting to continue serving as the Mayor of New York City.

On January 1, 2014, [[Bill de Blasio]] succeeded Bloomberg as the Mayor of New York City. After a brief stint as a full-time philanthropist, Bloomberg re-assumed the position of CEO at Bloomberg L.P. by the end of 2014. On March 7, 2016, Bloomberg announced that he would not run as a third party candidate in the [[United States Presidential election, 2016|2016 U.S. presidential election]] despite widespread speculation that he would, and later endorsed Democratic nominee [[Hillary Clinton]] for president.

==Early life==
Michael Bloomberg was born at [[St. Elizabeth's Medical Center (Boston)|St. Elizabeth's Hospital]], in the [[Brighton, Massachusetts|Brighton]] neighborhood of [[Boston]], on February 14, 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Charlotte R.

Bloomberg's father, William Henry Bloomberg (1906–1963), was born in Chelsea, Massachusetts, and worked as an accountant for a dairy company. He was the son of Alexander "Elick" Bloomberg, an [[Immigration of Eastern European Jews|immigrant from Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Michael-Bloomberg|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|title=Michael Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Baker Library/Bloomberg Center|Bloomberg Center]] at the [[Harvard Business School]] was named in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Baker Library/Bloomberg Center|url=http://www.hbs.edu/about/campus-and-culture/campus-built-on-philanthropy/Pages/baker-library-bloomberg-center.aspx|website=Harvard Business School|accessdate=October 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother, Charlotte (Rubens) Bloomberg (January 2, 1909 – June 19, 2011) was a native of [[Jersey City]], [[New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/20/nyregion/charlotte-r-bloomberg-mayors-mother-dies-at-102.html|title=Charlotte R.

The family lived in [[Allston, Massachusetts|Allston]], Massachusetts, until Bloomberg was two years old, when they moved to [[Brookline, Massachusetts|Brookline]] for the next two years, finally settling in [[Medford, Massachusetts|Medford]], a Boston suburb, where he lived until after he graduated from college.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/19/nyregion/bloombergs-hometown-medford-mass-struggles-to-keep-his-attention.html|title=Mayor's Ties to Hometown Fade, but for a Few, They Are Still Felt|work=The New York Times|date=March 19, 2012|author=Michael M.

Bloomberg attended [[Johns Hopkins University]], where he joined the fraternity [[Phi Kappa Psi]]. In 1962, as a sophomore, he constructed the school's mascot, the [[Johns Hopkins Blue Jays|blue jay]]. He graduated in 1964 with a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in [[Electrical Engineering]].

==Business career==
In 1973, Bloomberg became a [[general partner]] at [[Salomon Brothers]], a [[bulge-bracket]] [[Wall Street]] investment bank, where he headed [[equity trading]] and, later, [[systems development]]. In 1981, Salomon Brothers was bought&lt;ref&gt;Bloomberg, Michael (1997). ''Bloomberg by Bloomberg'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. [https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/b/bloomberg-bloomberg.html?_r=2 "The Last Supper"], {{ISBN|0-471-15545-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Phibro Corporation, and Bloomberg was laid off from the [[investment bank]].&lt;ref&gt;Patrick McGeehan, [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/19/nyregion/19bankers.html?hp "City Will Help Retrain Laid-Off Wall Streeters"], "The New York Times", February 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He was given no severance package, but owned $10 million worth of equity as a partner at the firm.

Using this money, Bloomberg went on to set up a company named Innovative Market Systems. His business plan was based on the realization that Wall Street (and the financial community generally) was willing to pay for high-quality business information, delivered as quickly as possible and in as many usable forms possible, via technology (e.g., graphs of highly specific trends).&lt;ref&gt;Richard S. Goldberg (January 2009). ''The Battle for Wall Street'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.

Bloomberg—Democratization of Information"], {{ISBN|0470222794}}/{{ISBN|9780470222799}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, [[Merrill Lynch]] became the new company's first customer, installing 22 of the company's Market Master terminals and investing $30 million in the company. The company was renamed [[Bloomberg L.P.]] in 1987.&lt;ref name="FMB"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/michael-bloomberg|title=Michael Bloomberg|date=September 2016|work=[[Forbes]]|accessdate=February 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1990, it had installed 8,000 terminals.&lt;ref&gt;Bloomberg, Michael (1997). ''Bloomberg by Bloomberg'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.; {{ISBN|0-471-15545-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, ancillary products including Bloomberg News, Bloomberg Message, and Bloomberg Tradebook were launched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloombergtradebook.com|title=Bloomberg Tradebook website|publisher=Bloombergtradebook.com|accessdate=April 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of October 2015, the company had more than 325,000 terminal subscribers worldwide.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title=How the Bloomberg Terminal Made History--And Stays Ever Relevant|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/3051883/behind-the-brand/the-bloomberg-terminal|website=FastCompany.com|accessdate=February 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His company also has a radio network which currently has 1130 [[WBBR (AM)|WBBR AM]] in New York City as its flagship station. He left the position of CEO to pursue a political career as the mayor of New York City. Bloomberg was replaced as CEO by Lex Fenwick.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dowjones.com/djcom/leadership/LFenwick.asp] Lex Fenwick's biography {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202221539/http://www.dowjones.com/djcom/leadership/LFenwick.asp|date=December 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During Bloomberg's three mayoral terms, the company was led by president [[Daniel L.

After completing his final term as the mayor of New York City, Bloomberg spent his first eight months out of office as a full-time philanthropist. In the fall of 2014, he announced that he would return to Bloomberg L.P. as CEO at the end of 2014,&lt;ref name="Andrww Ross Sorkin"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/04/business/media/michael-bloomberg-to-return-as-chief-of-company-he-founded.html|title=Michael Bloomberg to Return to Lead Bloomberg L.P.|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=[[Andrew Ross Sorkin]]|date=September 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; succeeding Doctoroff, who had led the company since retiring from the Bloomberg administration in February 2008.&lt;ref name="Andrww Ross Sorkin"/&gt; Bloomberg remains the CEO of Bloomberg L.P.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://about.bloomberg.com/company.html|title=Bloomberg's website|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|accessdate=April 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/lists/2008/54/400list08_Michael-Bloomberg_C610.html|title=The 400 Richest Americans: #8 Michael Bloomberg|date=September 17, 2008|accessdate=September 17, 2008|work=[[Forbes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wealth===
In March 2009, Forbes reported Bloomberg's wealth at $16 billion, a gain of $4.5 billion over the previous year, enjoying the world's biggest increase in wealth in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author=Farrell, Andrew |title=Billionaires Who Made Billions More |work=[[Forbes]] |url=https://www.forbes.com/2009/03/10/made-millions-worlds-richest-people-billionaires-2009-billionaires-gainer_slide_2.html?thisSpeed=3000 |accessdate=July 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, there were only four fortunes in the U.S. that were larger (although the [[Wal-Mart]] family fortune is split among four people). He had moved from 142nd to 17th in the ''[[Forbes]]'' list of the world's billionaires in only two years (March 2007 – March 2009).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/lists/2007/10/07billionaires_Michael-Bloomberg_C610.html "The World's Billionaires"], ''Forbes'', March 8, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/lists/2009/10/billionaires-2009-richest-people_Michael-Bloomberg_C610.html "The World's Billionaires"], Forbes.com, March 1, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2013, Forbes reported Bloomberg's wealth as $33 billion and ranked him as the 13th richest person in the world.

==Political career==
{{Main|Mayoralty of Michael Bloomberg}}

Bloomberg assumed office as the 108th [[Mayor of New York City]] on January 1, 2002. He won re-election in 2005 and again in 2009. As mayor, Bloomberg initially struggled to gain high approval levels from the public; however, he subsequently developed and maintained high approval ratings.&lt;ref&gt;Joyce Purnick, ''Mike Bloomberg: Money, Power, Politics'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; His re-election meant the Republicans had won the previous four mayoral elections (although Bloomberg's decision to leave the Republican Party and be declared an independent on June 19, 2007, resulted in the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]'s losing the mayor's seat prior to the expiration of his second term). Bloomberg joined [[Rudy Giuliani]] and [[Fiorello La Guardia]] as re-elected Republican mayors in the mostly Democratic city. ([[John Lindsay]] was also elected mayor of New York City twice while a registered Republican; however, Lindsay did not receive the Republican Party nomination during his [[New York City mayoral elections#1969|1969 campaign for re-election]] but ran successfully on the [[Liberal Party of New York|Liberal]] ticket and joined the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] during his second term.){{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

Bloomberg stated that he wanted [[public education]] reform to be the legacy of his first term and addressing poverty to be the legacy of his second.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gothamgazette.com/article/finance/20060907/8/1964 "The Mayor's Legacy"], ''[[Gotham Gazette]]'', September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the National Assessment of Educational Performance, fourth-grade reading scores from 2002-09 rose nationally by 11 points. However, on May 10, 2010, ''The New York Times'' reported:

&lt;blockquote&gt;According to the test [NAEP], New York City eighth graders have shown no significant improvement [in math or reading] since they began taking it in 2003, mirroring the largely flat performance of American eighth graders as a whole during that period. In the city, the lack of improvement held true across ethnic groups and also among lower-income students.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some activists (including [[Diane Ravitch]]) opposed Bloomberg's reforms, claiming his approach to the New York City education system was largely unsuccessful because of skewed numbers. Under the reformed approach, a school had to have done better than the previous year to receive funding. Due to this requirement, it was alleged that many successful schools were closed for being "unsuccessful" based on their inability to raise test scores, even though they were top performing schools, while many unsuccessful schools received the bulk of funding for simply raising their scores slightly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ravich|first=Diane|title=The Death and Life of The Great American School System: How Testing and Choice are Undermining Education|publisher=[[Basic Books]]|year=2010|isbn=978-0-465-01491-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bloomberg chose to apply a statistical, results-based approach to city management, appointing city commissioners based on their expertise and granting them wide autonomy in their decision-making. Breaking with 190 years of tradition, he implemented what ''New York Times'' political reporter [[Adam Nagourney]] called a "bullpen" open office plan, similar to a [[Wall Street]] trading floor, in which dozens of aides and managerial staff are seated together in a large chamber. The design is intended to promote accountability and accessibility.&lt;ref&gt;Nagourney, Adam (December 25, 2001).

In efforts to create "cutbacks" in the New York City Spending Bracket, Bloomberg declined to receive a city salary. He accepted a [[One-dollar salary|remuneration of $1 annually]] for his services.&lt;ref&gt;Biographiq (March 2008).

Anybody With a Phone Book"], "The New York Times", July 13, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and during his term as mayor, he lived not in [[Gracie Mansion]] – the official mayoral residence – but instead at his own home on the [[Upper East Side]] of [[Manhattan]]. He also has homes in London, [[Bermuda]] and [[Vail, Colorado]].&lt;ref&gt;Chris Smith, [http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/people/features/14573 "The Mayor and His Money"], nymag.com, September 26, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Bloomberg stated that during his mayoralty, he rode the [[New York City Subway]] on a daily basis, particularly in the commute from his 79th Street home to his office at [[New York City Hall|City Hall]]. An August 2007 story in ''[[The New York Times]]'' stated that he was often seen chauffeured by two [[New York Police Department]]-owned SUVs to an express train station to avoid having to change from the local to the express trains on the [[IRT Lexington Avenue Line]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael M. Grynbaum [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/01/nyregion/01bloomberg.html "Mayor Takes the Subway — by Way of S.U.V."], "The New York Times", August 1, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

He supported the construction of the [[7 Subway Extension]] and the [[Second Avenue Subway]]; on December 20, 2013, Bloomberg took a ceremonial ride on a train to the new [[34th Street (IRT Flushing Line)|34th Street]] station to celebrate a part of his legacy as mayor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Three cheers for the No. 7 extension |url=https://nypost.com/2013/12/20/mayor-mikes-hudson-yards-feat|date=December 20, 2013|work=New York Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/bloomberg-sneak-ride-7-line-extension-article-1.1554643|title=Mayor Bloomberg gets ride on No. 7 subway line extension he championed|work=Daily News|location=New York|date=October 21, 2013|accessdate=December 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elections===
====2001 election====
{{Main|New York City mayoral election, 2001}}
In 2001, the incumbent mayor of New York City, [[Rudy Giuliani]], was ineligible for re-election, as the city limited the mayoralty to two consecutive terms. Several well-known New York City politicians aspired to succeed him. Bloomberg, a lifelong member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], decided to run for mayor as a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] ticket. Voting in the primary began on the morning of September 11, 2001. The primary was postponed later that day, due to the [[September 11 attacks]]. In the rescheduled primary, Bloomberg defeated [[Herman Badillo]], a former [[United States House of Representatives|Congressman]], to become the Republican nominee. Meanwhile, the Democratic primary did not produce a first-round winner. After a [[Two-round system|runoff]], the Democratic nomination went to [[New York City Public Advocate]] [[Mark J. Green]].

In the general election, Bloomberg received Giuliani's endorsement. He also had a huge spending advantage. Although New York City's [[Campaign finance in the United States|campaign finance]] law restricts the amount of contributions which a candidate can accept, Bloomberg chose not to use public campaign funds and therefore his campaign was not subject to these restrictions. He spent $73 million of his own money on his campaign, outspending Green five to one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ideas_opinions/story/143966p-127415c.html |title=Mike's Wrong, Campaign Fixes Make Sense |work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|location=New York|author=[[Gene Russianoff|Russianoff, Gene]]|date=December 9, 2003|archivedate=January 5, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060105025803/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ideas_opinions/story/143966p-127415c.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the major themes of his campaign was that, with the city's economy suffering from the effects of the World Trade Center attacks, it needed a mayor with business experience.

In addition to serving as the Republican nominee, Bloomberg had the ballot line of the controversial [[Independence Party of New York|Independence Party]], in which "[[Social Therapy]]" leaders [[Fred Newman (philosopher)|Fred Newman]] and [[Lenora Fulani]] exert strong influence. Some{{Who|date=January 2018}} say that endorsement was important, as Bloomberg's votes on that line exceeded his margin of victory over Green. (Under New York's [[Electoral fusion|fusion]] rules, a candidate can run on more than one party's line and combine all the votes received on all lines. Green, the Democrat, had the ballot line of the [[Working Families Party]]. He also created an independent line called Students First whose votes were combined with those on the Independence line). Another factor was the vote in [[Staten Island]], which has traditionally been far friendlier to Republicans than the rest of the city. Bloomberg handily beat Green in that borough, taking 75 percent of the vote there. Overall, [[Election results for mayor of New York|Bloomberg won 50 percent to 48 percent]].{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

Bloomberg's election marked the first time in New York City history that two different Republicans had been elected mayor consecutively. New York City has not been won by a Republican in a presidential election since [[Calvin Coolidge]] won in [[United States presidential election, 1924|1924]]. Bloomberg is considered a social [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]], who is [[pro-choice]], in favor of [[legalization|legalizing]] [[same-sex marriage]] and an advocate for stricter [[gun control]] laws. Although 68 percent of New York City's registered voters are Democrats, Bloomberg decided the city should host the 2004 Republican National Convention. The convention drew thousands of protesters, many of them local residents angry over the Iraq war and other issues. The New York Police Department arrested approximately 1,800 protesters, but according to ''The New York Times'', more than 90 percent of the cases were later dismissed or dropped for lack of evidence.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

====2005 election====
{{Main|New York City mayoral election, 2005}}
Bloomberg was [[New York City mayoral election, 2005|re-elected]] mayor in November 2005 by a margin of 20 percent, the widest margin ever for a Republican mayor of New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/story/363961p-309955c.html|title=Bloomberg wins by a KO: Crushes Ferrer by nearly 20-point margin|work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|location=New York|date=November 9, 2005|accessdate=November 12, 2008|archivedate=November 26, 2005|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051126142753/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/story/363961p-309955c.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spent almost $78 million on his campaign, exceeding the record of $74 million he spent on the previous election.

====2009 election====
{{Main|New York City mayoral election, 2009}}
On October 2, 2008, Bloomberg announced he would seek to extend the [[New York City mayoral elections#Terms and term limits (since 1834)|city's term limits law]] and run for a third mayoral term in 2009, arguing a leader of his field was needed following the [[financial crisis of 2007–08]]. "Handling this financial crisis while strengthening essential services&amp;nbsp;... is a challenge I want to take on," Bloomberg said at a news conference. "So should the City Council vote to amend term limits, I plan to ask New Yorkers to look at my record of independent leadership and then decide if I have earned another term."&lt;ref name=Honan_Reuters_20081002&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/marketsNews/idUSN0228265920081002|title=NYC's Bloomberg Says To Seek Third Term as Mayor|date=October 2, 2008|author=Honan, Edith|agency=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ronald Lauder, who campaigned for New York City's term limits in 1993 and spent over 4 million dollars of his own money to limit the maximum years a mayor could serve to eight years,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/24/nyregion/ronald-lauder-leader-of-term-limit-band.html|title=Ronald Lauder, Leader Of Term-Limit Band|author=Steven Lee Myers|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 24, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; sided with Bloomberg in running for a third term and agreed to stay out of future legality issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/30/lauder-favors-a-third-term-for-bloomberg/?gwh=8A7834701200D6D78B2C4A9152DBC171&amp;gwt=pay|title=Lauder Favors a Third Term for Bloomberg|author=Jonathan P.

Some people and organizations objected and [[NYPIRG]] filed a complaint with the City Conflict of Interest Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mas.org/citizens-unionnypirg-forum-on-term-limits-tonight|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106100625/http://mas.org/citizens-unionnypirg-forum-on-term-limits-tonight/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2012-01-06|title=Citizens Union/NYPIRG Forum on Term Limits Tonight|publisher=mas.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 23, 2008, the City Council voted 29–22 in favor of extending the term limit to three consecutive four-year terms, thus allowing Bloomberg to run for office again.&lt;ref name="nyccouncil"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://wcbstv.com/breakingnewsalerts/bloomberg.third.term.2.847239.html |title={{-'}}Aye' And Mighty: Bloomberg's Wish Is Granted |publisher=[[WCBS-TV]] |date=October 23, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081025085132/http://wcbstv.com/breakingnewsalerts/bloomberg.third.term.2.847239.html |archivedate=October 25, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After two days of public hearings, Bloomberg signed the bill into law on November 3.&lt;ref name=Chan-Chen_NYT_20081103&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/03/bloomberg-hears-opponents-of-term-limits-bill|title=City Room: After an Earful, Mayor Signs Term Limits Bill|work=[[The New York Times]]|authorlink=Sewell Chan|last=Chan|first=Sewell|last2=Chen|first2=David W.|date=November 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bloomberg's bid for a third term generated some controversy. Civil libertarians such as former [[New York Civil Liberties Union]] Director [[Norman Siegel]] and New York Civil Rights Coalition Executive Director Michael Meyers joined with local politicians such as New York State Senator [[Eric Adams (politician)|Eric Adams]] to protest the term-limits extension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.sohojournal.com/?p=1374|title=the SoHo Journal|publisher=Archive.sohojournal.com|date=October 6, 2008|accessdate=November 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bloomberg's opponent was [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] and [[Working Families Party]] nominee [[Bill Thompson (New York)|Bill Thompson]], who had been [[New York City Comptroller]] for the past eight years and before that, President of the [[New York City Board of Education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comptroller.nyc.gov|title=Office of the New York City Controller|publisher=Comptroller.nyc.gov|date=April 14, 2014|accessdate=April 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bloomberg defeated Thompson by a vote of 51% to 46%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://elections.nytimes.com/2009/results/index.html |title=2009 Election Results |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 5, 2009 |accessdate=May 12, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091107034641/http://elections.nytimes.com/2009/results/index.html |archivedate=November 7, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the release of Independence Party campaign filings in January 2010, it was reported that Bloomberg had made two $600,000 contributions from his personal account to the Independence Party on October 30 and November 2, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|authorlink=Elizabeth Benjamin (journalist)|last=Benjamin|first=Elizabeth|title=Bloomberg's Independence (Pay)Day|work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|location=New York|date=January 25, 2010|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/2010/01/bloombergs-independence-payday.html|accessdate=April 17, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100130014725/http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/2010/01/bloombergs-independence-payday.html |archivedate=January 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Independence Party then paid $750,000 of that money to Republican Party political operative John Haggerty Jr.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Eligon, John|title=How G.O.P.

Prior to the announcement in an interview in ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine, Bloomberg praised ''[[The New York Times]]'' for its endorsement of [[Christine Quinn]] and [[Joe Lhota]] as their favorite candidates in the Democratic and Republican primaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=In Conversation: Michael Bloomberg |url=http://nymag.com/news/politics/bloomberg/in-conversation-2013-9/#|first=Chris|last=Smith|work=New York|date=September 7, 2013|accessdate=October 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Michael Bloomberg: I Won't Endorse Candidate In New York City Mayor Race|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/13/michael-bloomberg-endorse-no-new-york-city-mayor-race_n_3920428.html|work=The Huffington Post|date=September 13, 2013|accessdate=October 10, 2013|first=Christopher|last=Mathias}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quinn came in third in the Democratic primary and Lhota won the Republican primary.

Earlier in the month, Bloomberg was chastised in the press for his remarks regarding Democratic mayoral candidate [[Bill de Blasio]]'s campaign methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Louis |first=Errol|title=Bloomberg's 'racist' remark reveals much |url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/09/09/opinion/louis-bloomberg-de-blasio|publisher=CNN|date=September 9, 2013|accessdate=October 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bloomberg said initially in the ''New York'' magazine interview that he considered de Blasio's campaign "racist" and when asked about his comment, Bloomberg explained what he meant by his remark.&lt;ref name=AtlanticRacist&gt;{{cite news|last=Simpson|first=Connor|title=New York Alters Bloomberg 'Racist' Accusation|url=http://www.theatlanticwire.com/politics/2013/09/michael-bloomberg-calls-bill-de-blasios-campaign-racist/69157|work=The Atlantic|date=September 7, 2013|accessdate=October 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Well, no, no, I mean he's making an appeal using his family to gain support. I think it's pretty obvious to anyone watching what he's been doing.

On January 1, 2014, de Blasio became New York City's new mayor, succeeding Bloomberg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Deprez|first=Esmé E.|title=Obama Endorses Fellow Democrat De Blasio for New York Mayor|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-09-23/obama-endorses-fellow-democrat-de-blasio-for-new-york-city-mayor.html|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|accessdate=October 10, 2013|date=September 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political stances===
Some of the policies Bloomberg advocates parallel those of either the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] or the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] party platform. He is socially [[Social liberalism|liberal]] or [[Progressivism|progressive]], supporting abortion rights, same-sex marriage, strict gun control measures, and citizenship for illegal immigrants, for example. On economics, foreign, and domestic issues, Bloomberg tends to be conservative or moderate. He opposed a timeline for withdrawal from the [[Iraq War]], and criticized those who favored one. Economically, he supports government involvement in issues such as public welfare, while being strongly in favor of free trade, pro-business, and describing himself as a [[Fiscal conservatism|fiscal conservative]] because he balanced the city's budget.&lt;ref name=ukspeech&gt;[http://www.nyc.gov/portal/site/nycgov/menuitem.c0935b9a57bb4ef3daf2f1c701c789a0/index.jsp?pageID=mayor_press_release&amp;catID=1194&amp;doc_name=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nyc.gov%2Fhtml%2Fom%2Fhtml%2F2007b%2Fpr348-07.html&amp;cc=unused1978&amp;rc=1194&amp;ndi=1 Mayor Bloomberg Delivers Remarks at 2007 Conservative Party Conference]".

====Social issues====
Bloomberg supports abortion rights, stating, "Reproductive choice is a fundamental human right and we can never take it for granted. On this issue, you're either with us or against us." He has criticized "[[pro-choice]]" politicians who support "[[pro-life]]" candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/2008/Mike_Bloomberg_Abortion.htm|title=Mike Bloomberg on Abortion|accessdate=August 2, 2007|work=[[On The Issues]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bloomberg supports governmental funding for [[embryonic stem cell]] research, calling the Republican position [[Stem cell controversy|on the issue]] "insanity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mudge.essoenn.com/2007/07/10/mm056-rolling-stone-bloomberg-08-can-a-republican-mayor-of-new-york-take-the-white-house|title=Bloomberg '08: Can a Republican Mayor of New York Take the White House?|publisher=Mudge.essoenn.com|date=July 10, 2007|accessdate=November 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He supports [[same-sex marriage]] with the rationale that "government shouldn't tell you whom to marry."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/1010/Bloomberg_for_samesex_marriage.html|title=Bloomberg for same-sex marriage|author=Smith, Ben|date=October 4, 2010|accessdate=April 5, 2012|work=Politico}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bloomberg supports the strict drug laws of New York City. He has stated that he smoked [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] in the past, and was quoted in a 2001 interview as saying "You bet I did. I enjoyed it." This led to a reported $500,000 advertising campaign by [[NORML]], featuring his image and the quote. Bloomberg stated in a 2002 interview that he regrets the remark and does not believe that marijuana should be decriminalized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04E6D6113DF933A25757C0A9649C8B63 |title=Bloomberg Says He Regrets Marijuana Remarks |work=[[The New York Times]]|author=Steinhauer, Jennifer|date=April 10, 2002|accessdate=January 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Crime and punishment====
In April 2006, along with Boston mayor [[Thomas Menino]], Bloomberg co-founded [[Mayors Against Illegal Guns]].&lt;ref name=MAIG-PR131219&gt;{{cite news|title=Mayors Against Illegal Guns And Moms Demand Action To Join Forces, Unite A National Movement To Protect Communities And Save Lives|url=http://www.sacbee.com/2013/12/19/6013494/mayors-against-illegal-guns-and.html|newspaper=Sacramento Bee |date=December 19, 2013|type=Press Release|accessdate=December 28, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230232604/http://www.sacbee.com/2013/12/19/6013494/mayors-against-illegal-guns-and.html|archivedate=December 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BloombergMeninoWSJOp&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bloomberg |first1=Michael R.|last2=Menino|first2=Thomas M.|date=June 30, 2008|title=Some Gun Rules We Can All Agree On|url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB121478283640414407|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|location=New York|type=Opinion|accessdate=December 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A December 2013 press release by the group said the bipartisan coalition included over 1,000 mayors.&lt;ref name=MAIG-PR131219/&gt; In 2014, the organisation merged with Moms Demand Action For Gun Sense in America to form [[Everytown for Gun Safety]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2016/06/20/everytowns-survivors-network-stands-on-the-front-lines-of-the-gun-control-battle/&lt;/ref&gt; which in 2018 in collaboration with student groups organized the [[March For Our Lives]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-43105699&lt;/ref&gt;

As mayor, Bloomberg increased the mandatory minimum sentence for illegal possession of a loaded handgun, saying: "Illegal guns don't belong on our streets and we're sending that message loud and clear. We're determined to see that gun dealers who break the law are held accountable, and that criminals who carry illegal loaded guns serve serious time behind bars."&lt;ref name="crime"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/2008/Mike_Bloomberg_Crime.htm|title=Mike Bloomberg on Crime|accessdate=August 2, 2007|work=[[On The Issues]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He opposes the death penalty, saying he would "rather lock somebody up and throw away the key and put them in [[Penal labour|hard labor]]".&lt;ref name="crime"/&gt; Bloomberg is a staunch proponent of [[stop-and-frisk in New York City]] and cited that Stop and Frisk dramatically reduced crime rates.&lt;ref name="crime"/&gt;

====Education====
Bloomberg replaced the school board set up by the state with direct mayoral control over [[public education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cityandstateny.com/allies|title=Allies|publisher=City &amp; State|accessdate=November 5, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120416022013/http://www.cityandstateny.com/allies|archivedate=April 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He raised the salaries of teachers by fifteen percent&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/39427801/ns/nbc_press/t/transcriptmayor-michael-bloomberg-speech-nbcs-tom-brokaw-introduction|title=Transcript: Mayor Michael Bloomberg Speech; NBC'S Tom Brokaw Introduction|publisher=MSNBC|date=September 29, 2010|accessdate=November 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the test scores of students in the city and the graduation rate rose as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Mayor praises NYC high school graduation rate|url=http://www.boston.com/news/education/articles/2012/06/12/mayor_praises_nyc_high_school_graduation_rate|date=June 12, 2012|first=Verena|last=Dobnik|work=Boston Globe |agency=Associated Press|accessdate=May 2, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203014029/http://www.boston.com/news/education/articles/2012/06/12/mayor_praises_nyc_high_school_graduation_rate|archivedate=December 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He opposes [[social promotion]], stating that students should be promoted only when they are adequately prepared for the next grade level. He favors after-school programs to help students who are behind. As mayor, Bloomberg strengthened the cell-phone ban in schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/2008/Mike_Bloomberg_Education.htm|title=Mike Bloomberg on Education|accessdate=August 2, 2007|work=[[On The Issues]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Environmental issues====
During his second term as the mayor of New York City, Bloomberg unveiled [[PlaNYC]]: A Greener, Greater New York on April 22, 2007, to fight global warming, protect the environment and prepare for the projected 1 million additional people expected to be living in the city by the year 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Bloomberg Draws a Blueprint for a Greener City|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/23/nyregion/23mayor.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 23, 2007|accessdate=November 15, 2015|issn=0362-4331|first=Thomas J.|last=Lueck}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under PlaNYC, in just 6 years New York City reduced citywide greenhouse gas emissions by 19% since 2005 and was on track to achieve a 30% reduction ahead of the PlaNYC 2030 goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and new expanded programs to continue the progress |url=http://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/440-13/mayor-bloomberg-deputy-mayor-holloway-office-long-term-planning-sustainibility |website=The official website of the City of New York |date=December 30, 2013 |accessdate=November 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2007, as part of PlaNYC, Bloomberg launched the Million Trees NYC initiative, which aimed to plant and care for one million trees throughout the city in the next decade. In November 2015, New York City planted its one millionth tree, two years ahead of the original 10-year schedule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Bronx Planting Caps Off a Drive to Add a Million Trees |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/21/nyregion/new-york-city-prepares-to-plant-one-millionth-tree-fulfilling-a-promise.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=October 20, 2015|access-date = November 15, 2015 |issn=0362-4331 |first=Lisa W. |last=Foderaro}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Bloomberg convened the [[New York City Panel on Climate Change]] (NPCC), an effort to prepare the city for climate change.&lt;ref name="NPCC1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nyas.org/Publications/Annals/Detail.aspx?cid=ab9d0f9f-1cb1-4f21-b0c8-7607daa5dfcc |title=Climate Change Adaptation in New York City: Building a Risk Management Response |publisher=The New York Academy of Sciences |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, ''[[Travel + Leisure]]'' readers voted New York City the "Dirtiest American City," for having the most extant litter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.travelandleisure.com/articles/americas-dirtiest-cities America's Dirtiest Cities – Articles | Travel + Leisure]. Travelandleisure.com. Retrieved August 16, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Bloomberg has been involved in motivating other cities to make changes and has spoken about reducing [[carbon dioxide emissions]], using cleaner and more efficient [[fuels]], using [[congestion pricing in New York City]], and encouraging [[public transportation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mikebloomberg.com/en/issues/environment_sustainability/mayor_michael_bloomberg_delivers_keynote_address_at_the_c40_large_cities_climate_summit |title=Mayor Michael Bloomberg Delivers Keynote Address at the C40 Large Cities Climate Summit |date=May 15, 2007 |accessdate=August 2, 2007 |publisher=mikebloomberg.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928061215/http://www.mikebloomberg.com/en/issues/environment_sustainability/mayor_michael_bloomberg_delivers_keynote_address_at_the_c40_large_cities_climate_summit |archivedate=September 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bloomberg unveiled the Special Initiative for Rebuilding and Resiliency (SIRR) in June 2013, after the city was affected by [[Hurricane Sandy]] in October 2012. The $20-billion initiative laid out extensive plans to protect New York City against future the [[Effects of global warming|impacts of climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=3 Years After Hurricane Sandy, Is New York Prepared for the Next Great Storm? |url=http://www.thenation.com/article/3-years-after-hurricane-sandy-is-new-york-prepared-for-the-next-great-storm|newspaper=The Nation|accessdate=November 15, 2015|issn=0027-8378}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 26, 2013, Bloomberg announced that his administration's air pollution reduction efforts had resulted in the best air quality in New York City in more than 50 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=New York's Air Is Cleanest in 50 Years, Survey Finds|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/27/nyregion/new-yorks-air-is-cleanest-in-50-years-survey-finds.html|newspaper=The New York Times |date=September 26, 2013|accessdate=November 15, 2015|issn=0362-4331|first=Kate|last=Taylor}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the air quality improvement was attributed to the phasing out of heavy polluting heating oils through New York's "Clean Heat" program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Cleanest air in 50 years!

====Immigration====
On issues of domestic and [[homeland security]], Bloomberg has attacked [[social conservative]]s on [[Illegal immigration in the United States|immigration]], calling their stance unrealistic: "We're not going to deport 12 million people, so let's stop this fiction. Let's give them permanent status."&lt;ref name="NYTimmigration"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/31/nyregion/31bloomberg.html?adxnnl=1&amp;adxnnlx=1198350110-vYFGBtHCTCLxOWUXqw9TUw|title=Mayor Attacks 2 Main Ideas on Immigrants|accessdate=December 22, 2007|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=[[Sewell Chan|Chan, Sewell]] |date=March 31, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He supports a federal ID database that uses [[DNA]] and [[fingerprint]] technology to keep track of all citizens and to verify their legal status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/2008/Mike_Bloomberg_Homeland_Security.htm|title=Mike Bloomberg on Homeland Security|accessdate=August 2, 2007|work=[[On The Issues]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bloomberg has held that illegal immigrants should be offered legalization and supported the congressional efforts of [[John McCain]] and the late [[Ted Kennedy]] in their attempt at [[Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007|immigration reform]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052748703387904576279293334248326|title=A New Immigration Consensus|author=Michael R. Bloomberg |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=May 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding border security, he compared it to the tide, stating, "It's as if we expect border control agents to do what a century of communism could not: defeat the natural market forces of supply and demand... and defeat the natural human desire for freedom and opportunity. You might as well as sit in your beach chair and tell the tide not to come in. As long as America remains a nation dedicated to the proposition that 'all Men are created equal, endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness', people from near and far will continue to seek entry into our country."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://judiciary.senate.gov/hearings/testimony.cfm?id=1983&amp;wit_id=5493|title=Testimony of The Honorable Michael R.

In 2006, Bloomberg stated on his weekly [[WABC (AM)|WABC]] radio show that illegal immigration does not strain the financial resources of New York City, since many immigrants are hard working and "do not avail themselves of services until their situation is dire".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/records/pdf/mayoral-collections/michael-r-bloomberg-2002-2013.pdf|title=Guide to Office of the Mayor|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

====Health regulations====
In January 2011, city schools began a pilot program which allows girls over 14 years old to be provided with Plan B emergency contraception without parental consent, unless parents opt out in writing. Beginning with five schools, the pilot had been expanded to thirteen schools by September 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/24/nyregion/resistance-low-to-school-contraceptives-effort-new-york-health-officials-say.html|first=Anemona|last=Hartocollis|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=More Access to Contraceptives in City Schools|date=September 23, 2012|accessdate=March 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/york-city-plan-contraception-teens-school/story?id=17310468|first=Susan|last=Donaldson James|publisher=[[ABC News]]|title=New York City Schools Give Plan B 'Morning After' Pill to Teens|date=September 24, 2012|accessdate=March 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2012, the city passed a law limiting the practice of circumcision among Orthodox Jews. The legislation requires that at each event, the [[mohel]] receives signed consent forms from the parents, acknowledging that they were notified of health risks associated with cleaning the wound by sucking blood from the male baby's organ. This regulation caused an outcry among certain Orthodox Jewish communities on this alleged infringement of their religious freedom,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nysun.com/editorials/new-york-to-regulate-circumcision/87981|work=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]|location=London, UK|title=New York To Regulate Circumcision|date=September 12, 2012|accessdate=November 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2012-09-13/news/33823098_1_circumcision-wound-metzitzah-mohel|work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|location=New York |title=Leave circumcision ritual alone|date=September 13, 2012|accessdate=November 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the matter was taken to federal court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.algemeiner.com/2012/10/12/jewish-groups-sue-nyc-over-circumcision-regulation|work=[[The Algemeiner]]|title=Jewish Groups Sue NYC Over Circumcision Regulation|date=September 12, 2012|accessdate=November 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the same month, the [[New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene|NYC Board of Health]] approved Bloomberg's [[New York City soft drink size limit|proposal to ban]] the sale of many sweetened drinks more than 16 ounces (473&amp;nbsp;ml) in volume. The limit would have applied to businesses such as restaurants and movie theaters, but did not apply to grocery stores, including 7-Eleven. Diet varieties of sweetened drinks were unaffected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/13/new-york-approves-soda-ban-big-sugary-drinks_n_1880868.html|work=[[The Huffington Post]] |title=New York Soda Ban Approved: Board Of Health OKs Limiting Sale Of Large-Sized, Sugary Drinks|first=Jill|last=Colvin|date=September 13, 2012|accessdate=November 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 12, 2013, hours before the ban was scheduled to take effect, [[New York Supreme Court|State Supreme Court]] Justice Milton Tingling struck it down, ruling that the Board of Health lacked the jurisdiction to enforce it and that the rule was "arbitrary and capricious". The city appealed the decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New York City Soda Ban Health Fallout: Bloomberg's Legislation Struck Down...

Bloomberg announced that the city would appeal the decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/07/30/us/new-york-large-soda-ban/index.html?hpt=hp_t2|title=New York-size sodas get green light from appeals court|first=Erinn|last=Cawthon|publisher=CNN|date=July 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bloomberg has been criticized for some of his policies which have been described by many as facilitating the creation of a [[nanny state]].&lt;ref name=cnnnanny&gt;{{cite news|first=Tom|last=Watkins|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6GH0ToVTN?url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/03/24/us/michael-bloomberg-profile|archivedate=April 30, 2013|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/03/24/us/michael-bloomberg-profile|title=Bloomberg: Nanny-in-chief or health crusader?|publisher=CNN|date=March 24, 2013|accessdate=April 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comedian [[Bill Maher]], while on ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live]]'', said that Bloomberg's soda ban "gives liberals a bad name".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Jessica|last=Chasmar|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/apr/3/bill-maher-jimmy-kimmel-bloombergs-soda-ban-gives-|title=Bill Maher to Jimmy Kimmel: Bloomberg's soda ban 'gives liberals a bad name{{'-}}|work=The Washington Times|date =April 3, 2013|accessdate=April 29, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the soda ban, The [[Center for Consumer Freedom]] ran a full-page ad in ''[[The New York Times]]'' featuring an image of Bloomberg's face superimposed on an elderly female body wearing a dress and scarf, with the title "The Nanny", and the tagline "New Yorkers Need a Mayor, Not a Nanny."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Ron|last=Dicker|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/04/nanny-bloomberg-ad-in-new_n_1568037.html|title={{-'}}Nanny Bloomberg' Ad in New York Times Targets N.Y.

Criticism of Bloomberg's attempt to ban the sale of large soft drinks was picked up, mostly by [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] and [[libertarianism|libertarian]] commentators and politicians, as a line of attack in political campaigns around the United States. In one example, [[Virginia]] Attorney General [[Ken Cuccinelli]] and [[Kentucky]] Senator [[Rand Paul]] brought [[Big Gulp]]s to a joint appearance for Cuccinelli's ultimately unsuccessful [[Virginia gubernatorial election, 2013|2013 gubernatorial campaign]] to symbolize Bloomberg's efforts to restrict soft drink sales, criticizing the mayor for wanting "to buy the governor's office down here", a reference to pro-[[gun control]] advertisements his [[political action committee]] was running in the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/10/31/ken-cuccinelli-s-libertarian-love-affair.html|work=The Daily Beast|title=Ken Cuccinelli's Libertarian Love Affair|date=October 31, 2013|accessdate=November 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Republican legislators in [[Wisconsin]] reacted to the ban by inserting language to prohibit communities from restricting the sale of large soft drinks throughout the state in a 2013 budget bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.wpr.org/post/gop-lawmakers-want-prohibit-restrictions-big-gulp-sodas|publisher=Wisconsin Public Radio|title=GOP Lawmakers Want To Prohibit Restrictions on Big Gulp Sodas|date=May 9, 2013|accessdate=November 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Response to 9/11====
Bloomberg believes that the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] were not intended to be solitary events. When he assumed office, he set up a Counterterrorism Bureau which works along with the NYPD intelligence division to gather information about terrorism affecting New York City worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-YoDS2xu1aQC&amp;pg=PT23&amp;dq=michael+bloomberg+counterterrorism+bureau&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hAviT-2XGfS00AHfy9jUAw&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=michael%20bloomberg%20counterterrorism%20bureau&amp;f=false|title=A Decade of Hope: Stories of Grief and Endurance from 9/11 Families and Friends – Dennis Smith – Google Books|publisher=Books.google.com|accessdate=November 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believes that funding for [[Homeland Security]] by the federal government should be distributed by risk, where cities that are considered to have the highest threat for a terrorist attack would get the most money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hsgac.senate.gov/_files/010907Bloomberg.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070110071504/http://hsgac.senate.gov/_files/010907Bloomberg.pdf |archivedate=January 10, 2007 |title=Michael Bloomberg addresses the Senate |accessdate=August 2, 2007 |publisher=U.S. Senate}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bloomberg is also a supporter of the [[USA PATRIOT Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ontheissues.org/Mike_Bloomberg_VoteMatch.htm |title=Mike Bloomberg on the Issues |accessdate=August 2, 2007 |work=[[On The Issues]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the April 15, 2013, [[Boston Marathon bombings]], Bloomberg expressed the view that terrorism threats may require a reconsideration of civil liberties, saying "the people who are worried about privacy have a legitimate worry, but we live in a complex world where you're going to have to have a level of security greater than you did back in the olden days, if you will&amp;nbsp;... our laws and our interpretation of the Constitution, I think, have to change."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2013/04/23/mayor-bloomberg-interpretation-of-u-s-constitution-will-have-to-change-following-boston-bombings/ "Mayor Bloomberg: Interpretation of U.S. Constitution Will 'Have to Change' Following Boston Bombings"].

====Economic issues====
Bloomberg characterizes himself as a fiscal conservative for turning the city's $6-billion deficit into a $3-billion surplus; however, conservative PAC [[Club for Growth]] has criticized him because he increased [[property tax]]es and spending while doing so.

{{Quote|Being a fiscal conservative is not about slashing programs that help the poor, or improve health care, or ensure a [[social safety net]]. It's about insisting services are provided efficiently, get to only the people that need them, and achieve the desired results. Fiscal conservatives have hearts too&amp;nbsp;– but we also insist on using our brains, and that means demanding results and holding government accountable for producing them.

To me, fiscal conservatism means balancing budgets&amp;nbsp;– not running deficits that the next generation can't afford. It means improving the efficiency of delivering services by finding innovative ways to do more with less. It means cutting taxes when possible and prudent to do so, raising them overall only when necessary to balance the budget, and only in combination with spending cuts. It means when you run a surplus, you save it; you don't squander it. And most importantly, being a fiscal conservative means preparing for the inevitable economic downturns&amp;nbsp;– and by all indications, we've got one coming.|Michael Bloomberg|speech to [[UK Conservative Party]], September 30, 2007&lt;ref name=ukspeech/&gt;}}

Bloomberg has expressed a distaste of taxes, stating, "Taxes are not good things, but if you want services, somebody's got to pay for them, so they're a necessary evil."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.woopidoo.com/business_quotes/authors/michael-bloomberg-quotes.htm |title=Michael Bloomberg Quotes|accessdate=August 2, 2007|publisher=woopidoo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; As mayor, he did raise property taxes to fund budget projects; however, in January 2007, he proposed cuts in property taxes by five percent and cuts in sales taxes, including the elimination of taxes on clothing and footwear. Bloomberg pointed to the [[Wall Street]] profits and the real estate market as evidence that the city's economy is booming and could handle a tax break.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30914FF3A540C748DDDA80894DF404482&amp;n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fSubjects%2fP%2fProperty%20Taxes|title=Mayor Plans Cut in Property Tax And End to Sales Tax on Clothes|work=[[The New York Times]]|first=Diane|last=Cardwell|date=January 17, 2007|accessdate=August 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bloomberg's self-described fiscal conservatism also led him to eliminate the existing $6-billion deficit when he assumed office. Bloomberg balanced the budget of New York City by raising [[property taxes]] and making cuts to city agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rubinstein|first=Dana|url=http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/politics/2012/05/5832308/bloomberg-presents-balanced-budget-moving-parts|title=Bloomberg presents a balanced budget, with moving parts|publisher=Capital New York|date=May 3, 2012|accessdate=November 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bloomberg is in favor of providing tax breaks to big corporations for the good of the whole community. As mayor, Bloomberg lobbied the CEO of [[Goldman Sachs]] to establish its headquarters across from [[Ground Zero#World Trade Center|Ground Zero]] by promising $1.65 billion in tax breaks. Regarding this deal, Bloomberg stated, "This [New York City] is where the best want to live and work. So I told him [CEO of Goldman Sachs], 'We can help with minimizing taxes. Minimizing your rent. Improving security. But in the end, this is about people.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/people/features/14573/index1.html|title=The Strange Dichotomy of Mayor Michael Bloomberg – Philanthropist and politician|work=New York|date=October 3, 2005|accessdate=November 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bloomberg had less cordial relations with unions as mayor. In 2002, when New York City's transit workers threatened to strike, Bloomberg responded by riding a mountain bike through the city to show how the city could deal with the transit strike by finding alternate means of transportation and not pandering to the unions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transalt.org/press/askta/021216.html |title=Bikes, Mike and Transit Strike |accessdate=August 2, 2007 |publisher=transalt.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927000156/http://www.transalt.org/press/askta/021216.html |archivedate=September 27, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later, a clash over wages and union benefits led to a three-day strike. Negotiations led to the end of the strike in December 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,179800,00.html|publisher=Fox News Channel|title=Bloomberg Remarks on Transit Strike Raise Charges of Racism|date=December 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bloomberg is a staunch advocate of [[free trade]] and is strongly opposed to [[protectionism]], stating, "The things that we have to worry about is this protectionist movement that has reared its head again in this country...." He worries about the growth of China and fears the lessening gap between the United States and other countries: "The rest of the world is catching up, and, there are people that say, surpassing us. I hope they are wrong. I hope those who think we are still in good shape are right. But nevertheless, the time to address these issues is right now."&lt;ref name="income_gap"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/14/nyregion/14mayor.html|title=New York Mayor Warns Against Growing Inequality in U.S.|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=[[Sewell Chan|Chan, Sewell]]|date=March 14, 2007|accessdate=January 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bloomberg has placed a strong emphasis on [[public health]] and welfare, adopting many [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] policies. As the mayor he made HIV, [[diabetes]], and [[hypertension]] all top priorities. He extended the city's smoking ban to all commercial establishments and implemented a [[trans fat]] ban in restaurants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/2008/Mike_Bloomberg_Health_Care.htm|title=Mike Bloomberg on Health Care|accessdate=August 2, 2007|work=[[On The Issues]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bloomberg has been a strong supporter of the [[New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation]]&amp;nbsp;– the largest urban healthcare agency in the United States&amp;nbsp;– serving over 1.3 million New Yorkers, and has touted its use of information technology and [[Electronic Health Record]]s to increase efficiency and enhance patient care.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ci.nyc.ny.us:80/portal/site/nycgov/menuitem.c0935b9a57bb4ef3daf2f1c701c789a0/index.jsp?pageID=mayor_press_release&amp;catID=1194&amp;doc_name=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ci.nyc.ny.us%2Fhtml%2Fom%2Fhtml%2F2009a%2Fpr149-09.html&amp;cc=unused1978&amp;rc=1194&amp;ndi=1 Mayor Bloomberg Urges Mayors In Both Parties To Join Him In Support Of President Obama's Nonpartisan Principles For Health Reform And To Push For A Consensus Reform Package This Year] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809200742/http://www.ci.nyc.ny.us/portal/site/nycgov/menuitem.c0935b9a57bb4ef3daf2f1c701c789a0/index.jsp?pageID=mayor_press_release&amp;catID=1194&amp;doc_name=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ci.nyc.ny.us%2Fhtml%2Fom%2Fhtml%2F2009a%2Fpr149-09.html&amp;cc=unused1978&amp;rc=1194&amp;ndi=1 |date=August 9, 2011 }}.

March 31, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He launched a program called [[Opportunity NYC]] which is the nation's first-ever [[conditional cash transfer]] pilot program designed to help New Yorkers break the cycle of poverty in the city. He instituted a $7.5-billion municipal affordable housing plan, the largest in the nation, that is supposed to provide 500,000 New Yorkers with housing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ontheissues.org/2008/Mike_Bloomberg_Welfare_+_Poverty.htm |title=Mike Bloomberg on Welfare and Poverty |accessdate=August 2, 2007 |work=[[On The Issues]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bloomberg has expressed concern about poverty and growing class-divisions stating, "This society cannot go forward, the way we have been going forward, where the gap between the rich and the poor keeps growing."&lt;ref name="income_gap"/&gt;

====Foreign policy====
As mayor, Bloomberg made trips to Mexico, the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Israel in the first four months of 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ontheissues.org/2008/Mike_Bloomberg_Foreign_Policy.htm |title=Mike Bloomberg on Foreign Policy |accessdate=August 2, 2007 |work=[[On The Issues]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2007 he conducted an Asia trip that brought him to China, where he called for greater freedom of information to promote innovation. He attended the United Nations Climate Conference in [[Bali]].

Initially, Bloomberg strongly supported the war in [[Iraq War|Iraq]] and the rationale for going in. He stated, "Don't forget that the war started not very many blocks from here,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Larison|first=Daniel|url=http://www.theamericanconservative.com/larison/friedmans-bloomberg-fetish-and-centrist-foreign-policy|title=Friedman's Bloomberg Fetish and "Centrist" Foreign Policy|publisher=The American Conservative|date=April 18, 2012|accessdate=November 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; alluding to Ground Zero. In regard to the global [[War on Terrorism]] including Iraq he said, "It's not only to protect Americans. It's America's responsibility to protect people around the world who want to be free." During the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential election]] campaign, New York City hosted the [[Republican National Convention]] at which Bloomberg endorsed President [[George W. Bush]] for President of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A46503-2004Aug30.html|work=[[The Washington Post]]|title=Text of Mayor Michael Bloomberg's Speech at the Republican National Convention|date=August 30, 2004|accessdate=May 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His enthusiasm seemed to have lessened somewhat over the course of the war. In August 2005, he said, "I think everybody has very mixed emotions about the war that was started to find weapons of mass destruction and then they were not found."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/news/0542,barrett1,68949,5.html |title=Mayor Mute |date=October 11, 2005 |first=Wayne |last=Barrett |accessdate=June 18, 2011 |work=[[The Village Voice]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bloomberg expressed criticism of Democrats in [[United States Congress|Congress]] who wanted to set a timetable for withdrawal from Iraq, calling them "irresponsible".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2007/05/bloomberg_would_take_from_demo.html |title=Bloomberg would take from the Democrats |date=May 16, 2007 |first=Jack |last=Kelly |accessdate=June 18, 2011 |publisher=[[RealClearPolitics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Preservation and development issues====
[[File:Michael Bloomberg speech cropped (2).jpg|thumb|250px|Bloomberg delivering a speech]]
Bloomberg is a proponent of large-scale [[Urban development|development]]. He has repeatedly come down in favor of projects such as the [[Pacific Park, Brooklyn|Pacific Park]] mega-development, the [[Hudson Yards, Manhattan|Hudson Yards]] redevelopment (even supporting a [[7 Subway Extension|subway extension]] to Hudson Yards), and the [[Harlem]] rezoning proposal.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Timothy (April 2, 2008).

''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; On smaller-scale issues, Bloomberg usually takes the side of development as well. He favors the demolition of [[Admiral's Row]]&lt;ref&gt;Belenkaya, Veronika. [http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/brooklyn/2007/11/08/2007-11-08_navy_yard_museum_approved_but_admirals_r.html "Navy Yard Museum Approved but 'Admiral's Row' Gotta Go"], ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'', November 21, 2007. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111013091907/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/brooklyn/2007/11/08/2007-11-08_navy_yard_museum_approved_but_admirals_r.html|date=October 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; to build a supermarket parking lot. However, Bloomberg has occasionally come down on the side of preservation, most notably in vetoing landmark revocation for the Austin Nichols warehouse.&lt;ref&gt;Pogrebin, Robin (December 8, 2005). [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/08/arts/08land.html "Bloomberg, a Landmark and, Suddenly, a Veto"]. ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; This move was widely applauded by architectural historians.

===Political involvement outside New York===
====2008 presidential campaign speculation====
{{See also|Draft Bloomberg movement}}
On February 27, 2008, Bloomberg announced that he would not run for president in 2008, and that he would endorse a candidate who takes an independent and non-partisan approach.&lt;ref name=notrunning&gt;{{Cite news |author=Bloomberg, Michael R. |title=I'm Not Running for President, but ... |date=February 28, 2008 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/28/opinion/28mike.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=February 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had also stated unequivocally, live on ''[[Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve]]'', December 31, 2007, that he was not going to run for president in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.9wsyr.com/political/story.aspx?content_id=1c0e9b8d-35fb-4cdc-aee5-9c73c8d8a58f |title=Bloomberg: "I'm not running." |publisher=[[WSYR-TV]] |location=Syracuse, NY |date=January 1, 2008 |quote='Look, I'm not running for President,' Bloomberg said. }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite prior public statements by Bloomberg denying plans for a presidential run,&lt;ref&gt;Cardwell, Diane; Steinhauer, Jennifer (June 20, 2007).

''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; many pundits believed Bloomberg would announce a campaign at a later date. On January 7, 2008, he met at the [[University of Oklahoma]] with a bipartisan group, including (now former) [[Nebraska]] Senator [[Chuck Hagel]] and former [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] Senator [[Sam Nunn]], both of whom had been frequently mentioned as possible running mates – to pressure the major party candidates to promote national unity and reduce [[Partisanship|partisan]] [[gridlock]]. Speculation that Bloomberg would choose this forum to announce his candidacy proved to be unfounded.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Sam (December 31, 2007).

In summer 2006, he met with [[Al From]] of the [[Democratic Leadership Council]], a centrist group, to talk about the logistics of a possible run.&lt;ref&gt;Heilemann, John. [http://nymag.com/news/politics/25015 "His American Dream"]. ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'', December 11, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; After a conversation with Bloomberg, Republican [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Chuck Hagel]] of [[Nebraska]] suggested that he and Bloomberg could run on a shared independent ticket for the presidency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/05/13/ftn/main2795705.shtml "Hagel-Bloomberg In '08? – You Never Know"].

On ''[[This Week (ABC TV series)|This Week]]'' on June 10, 2007, anchor [[George Stephanopoulos]] included panelist [[Jay Carney]], who mentioned a conversation between Bloomberg and top staffers where he heard Bloomberg ask approximately how much a presidential campaign would cost. Carney said that one staffer replied, "Around $500 million." According to a ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' article, a $500-million budget would allow Bloomberg to circumvent many of the common obstacles faced by [[Third party (United States)|third-party]] presidential candidates.&lt;ref name="wp-shear"&gt;{{Cite news|author=Shear, Michael D.|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/25/AR2007032501334.html|title=N.Y.

On August 9, 2007, in an interview with former [[CBS News]] anchor [[Dan Rather]] that aired on August 21, Bloomberg categorically stated that he was not running for president, that he would not be running, and that there were no circumstances in which he would, saying, "If somebody asks me where I stand, I tell them. And that's not a way to get elected, generally. Nobody's going to elect me president of the United States. What I'd like to do is to be able to influence the dialogue. I'm a citizen."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author=[[Sewell Chan|Chan, Sewell]]|url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/08/17/rather-says-bloomberg-ruled-out-white-house-bid|title=City Room: Rather Says Bloomberg Ruled Out White House Bid|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=August 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite continued denials, a possible Bloomberg candidacy continued to be the subject of media attention, including a November ''[[Newsweek]]'' cover story.&lt;ref&gt;Meacham, Jon (November 12, 2007).

When Bloomberg asked the significance of 271, one guest answered correctly: the number of electoral votes received by George W. Bush in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/31/us/politics/31bloomberg.html|title=Bloomberg Closer to Running for President|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=Roberts, Sam|date=December 31, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2008, [[CNN]] reported that a source close to Bloomberg said that the mayor had launched a research effort to assess his chances of winning a potential presidential bid. According to the report, the unidentified source also stated that Bloomberg had set early March as a timetable for making a decision as to whether or not to run.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/01/10/bloomberg/ "Source: Bloomberg Research Effort Assessing Presidential Run"]. [[CNN]]. Retrieved January 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; On January 16, 2008, it was reported that Bloomberg's business interests were placed in "a sort of [[blind trust]]" because of his possible run for the presidency. His interests were put under the management of [[Quadrangle Group]], co-founded by reported Bloomberg friend [[Steven Rattner]], though Bloomberg would continue to control particular investment decisions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Ross Sorkin|Sorkin, Andrew Ross]] (January 16, 2008).

In January 2008, the [[Associated Press]] reported that Bloomberg met with Clay Mulford, a ballot-access expert and campaign manager for [[Ross Perot]]'s third-party presidential campaigns. Bloomberg denied that the meeting concerned a possible presidential campaign, and said the following month, "I am not – and will not be – a candidate for president." He added that he is "hopeful that the current campaigns can rise to the challenge by offering truly independent leadership. The most productive role that I can serve is to push them forward, by using the means at my disposal to promote a real and honest debate.&lt;ref name=notrunning/&gt;

At the same time that the presidential run was being considered, there was also some speculation that Bloomberg could be a candidate for the vice presidency in 2008. In a blog posting of June 21, 2007, [[Ben Smith (journalist)|Ben Smith]] of ''[[The Politico]]'' asked the question of whether a vice-presidential candidate can self-finance an entire presidential ticket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0607/Mike_for_Veep.html|title=Mike for Veep?|work=[[Politico (newspaper)|Politico]]|author=Smith, Ben|date=June 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rumored gubernatorial campaign====
In November 2007, the ''[[New York Post]]'' detailed efforts by [[New York State]] Republicans to recruit Bloomberg to oppose Governor [[Eliot Spitzer]] in the [[New York gubernatorial election, 2010|2010 election]].

====2012 presidential campaign speculation and role====
In March 2010, Bloomberg's top political strategist [[Kevin Sheekey]] resigned from his mayoral advisory position and returned to [[Bloomberg LP]], Bloomberg's company. It was speculated that the move would allow Sheekey to begin preliminary efforts for a Bloomberg presidential campaign in the [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012 election]]. An individual close to Bloomberg said, "the idea of continuing onward is not far from his [Bloomberg's] mind".&lt;ref&gt;Saul, Michael Howard (March 3, 2010).

In the speech, Bloomberg warned of the dangers a Trump presidency would pose. He said Trump "wants you to believe that we can solve our biggest problems by deporting Mexicans and shutting out Muslims. He wants you to believe that erecting trade barriers will bring back good jobs. He's wrong on both counts." Bloomberg also said Trump's economic plans "would make it harder for small businesses to compete" and would "erode our influence in the world."

====2018 elections====
In June 2018, Bloomberg made plans to give $80 million to support Democratic congressional candidates in the [[United States House of Representatives election, 2018|2018 election]], with the goal of flipping control of the Republican-controlled House to Democrats. In a statement, Bloomberg said that Republican House leadership were "absolutely feckless" and had failed to govern responsibly.

===Environmental advocacy===
Bloomberg is a dedicated environmentalist and has advocated policy to fight climate change at least since he became the mayor of New York City. At the national level, Bloomberg has consistently pushed for transitioning the United States' energy mix from fossil fuels to clean energy. In July 2011, Bloomberg donated $50 million through Bloomberg Philanthropies to [[Sierra Club]]'s [[Beyond Coal]] campaign, allowing the campaign to expand its efforts to shut down coal-fired power plants from 15 states to 45 states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=N.Y.
