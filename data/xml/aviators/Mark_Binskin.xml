==Early life==
Binskin was born in Sydney and grew up in [[Campbelltown, New South Wales]], where he attended Campbelltown Public School. He completed secondary schooling at [[Hurlstone Agricultural High School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://campbelltown.yourguide.com.au/news/local/general/flying-high/1224629.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120707044513/http://campbelltown.yourguide.com.au/news/local/general/flying-high/1224629.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=7 July 2012 |title=Flying high |accessdate=1 May 2008 |last=Gharahkani |first=Soraiya |date=16 April 2008 |work=Cambelltown Macarthur Advertiser }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Service history==
Binskin joined the [[Royal Australian Navy]] (RAN) in May 1978, and on completion of flying training was posted to fly [[McDonnell Douglas A-4G Skyhawk|A-4G Skyhawk]] aircraft at Naval Air Station [[HMAS Albatross (air station)|HMAS ''Albatross'']].&lt;ref name="raaf.gov.au - Chief of Air Force bio" /&gt; In January 1982, he was selected as the first RAN pilot to undergo an exchange with the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF), flying [[Dassault Mirage III|Mirage III]] aircraft. On completion of this exchange, and with the disbanding of the Navy's fixed wing capability, he transferred to the RAAF in 1984.&lt;ref name="raaf.gov.au - Chief of Air Force bio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.raaf.gov.au/Leaders/caf.aspx |title=Chief of Air Force |year=2009 |publisher=raaf.gov.au |accessdate=12 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100317143050/http://www.raaf.gov.au/leaders/caf.aspx |archivedate=17 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
