'''Harriet Quimby''' (May 11, 1875 – July 1, 1912) was an early American aviator and a movie screenwriter. In 1911, she was awarded a U.S. pilot's certificate by the [[Aero Club of America]], becoming the first woman to gain a pilot's license in the United States.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;  In 1912, she became the first woman to fly across the [[English Channel]]. Although Quimby lived only to the age of 37, she influenced the role of [[women in aviation]].

==Early life and early career==
She was born on May 11, 1875 in [[Arcadia Township, Manistee County, Michigan]]. After her family moved to [[San Francisco, California]], in the early 1900s, she became a journalist. She moved to [[Manhattan, New York City]] in 1903 to work as a theater critic for ''[[Leslie's Illustrated Weekly]]'' and more than 250 of her articles were published over a nine-year period.&lt;ref name=aopa2011&gt;{{cite web |first= Jill W. |last= Tallman |title= Thanks, Harriet |url= http://blog.aopa.org/blog/?p=2017 |publisher= AOPA Pilot |type= Harriet Quimby profile |accessdate= December 21, 2014 |date= August 2, 2011 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141221222536/http://blog.aopa.org/blog/?p=2017 |archivedate= December 21, 2014 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quimby became interested in aviation in 1910, when she attended the ''[[Belmont Park]] International Aviation Tournament'' in [[Elmont, New York]].&lt;ref name=aopa2011/&gt; There she met [[John Moisant]], a well-known aviator and operator of a flight school, and his sister [[Matilde Moisant|Matilde]].&lt;ref name=NAHoF&gt;{{cite web|title=Harriet Quimby profile|url=http://www.nationalaviation.org/our-enshrinees/quimby-harriet/|website=The National Aviation Hall of Fame|accessdate=October 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

On August 1, 1911, she took her pilot's test and became the first U.S. woman to earn an [[Aero Club of America]] aviator's certificate.&lt;ref name=aopa2011/&gt; [[Matilde Moisant]] soon followed and became the second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1911/1911%20-%200747.html|title=An American Lady Aviator|publisher=[[Flight International|''Flight'']]|date=August 26, 1911|accessdate=May 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hollywood==
In 1911 Quimby authored seven [[screenplays]] or [[scenarios]] that were made into [[silent film]] shorts by [[Biograph Studios]]. All seven were directed by director [[D. W. Griffith]]. Stars in her films included [[Florence La Badie]], [[Wilfred Lucas]], and [[Blanche Sweet]]. Quimby had a small acting role in one movie.&lt;ref&gt;Internet Movie Database, [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0703644/ Harriet Quimby] (and links therein); accessed April 16, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vin Fiz ==
The [[Vin Fiz]] Company, a division of [[Armour and Company|Armour Meat Packing]] Plant of [[Chicago]], recruited Quimby as the spokesperson for the new grape soda, Vin Fiz, after the death of [[Calbraith Perry Rodgers]] in April 1912. Her distinctive purple aviator uniform and image graced many of the advertising pieces of the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://airportjournals.com/vin-fiz-reborn |publisher=Airport journal |title=Vin Fiz reborn |first1=Henry M. |last1=Holden |accessdate=October 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==English Channel flight==
On April 16, 1912, Quimby took off from [[Dover, England]], en route to [[Calais, France]], and made the flight in 59 minutes, landing about {{convert|25|mi}} from Calais on a beach in [[Équihen-Plage]], [[Pas-de-Calais]]. She became the first woman to pilot an aircraft across the English Channel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1912/1912%20-%200345.html "Miss Quimby Flies The Channel"][[Flight International|''Flight'']] April 20, 1912&lt;/ref&gt;  Her accomplishment received little media attention, however, as the [[Sinking of the RMS Titanic|sinking]] of the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']] the day before consumed the interest of the public and filled newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Titanic Sinks Four Hours After Hitting Iceberg|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1912/04/16/|accessdate=October 3, 2016|work=The New York Times|date=April 16, 1912}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
[[File:Portrait of Matilde Moisant (left) and Harriet Quimby (right) Circa 1911-1912.jpg|thumb|Harriet Quimby and [[Matilde E. Moisant|Matilde Moisant]], circa 1911–12]]
On July 1, 1912, she flew in the ''Third Annual Boston Aviation Meet'' at [[Squantum (Quincy, Massachusetts)|Squantum, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news |author= |title=Miss Quimby Dies In Airship Fall. Noted Woman Aviator and W.A.P. Willard, Passenger, Are Thrown 1,000 Feet |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E07E1DE123CE633A25751C0A9619C946396D6CF&amp;legacy=true |quote= |newspaper=The New York Times |date=July 2, 1912 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although she had obtained her ACA certificate to be allowed to participate in ACA events, the Boston meet was an unsanctioned contest. Quimby flew out to [[Boston Light]] in [[Boston Harbor]] at about 3,000 feet, then returned and circled the airfield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Harriet Quimby Crash, 1912|url=http://www.celebrateboston.com/disasters/harriet-quimby-crash.htm|website=CelebrateBoston.com|accessdate=October 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William A.P. Willard]], the organizer of the event and father of the aviator [[Charles Willard (aviator)|Charles Willard]], was a passenger in her brand-new two-seat [[Blériot XI|Bleriot]] [[monoplane]]. At an altitude of {{convert|1000|ft}} the aircraft unexpectedly pitched forward for reasons still unknown. Both Willard and Quimby were ejected from their seats and fell to their deaths, while the plane "glided down and lodged itself in the mud".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centennialofflight.net/essay/Explorers_Record_Setters_and_Daredevils/quimby/EX5.htm|title=Harriet Quimby profile|publisher=centennialofflight.net|accessdate=May 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harriet Quimby was buried in the [[Woodlawn Cemetery, Bronx|Woodlawn Cemetery]] in [[The Bronx, New York]]. The following year her remains were moved to the [[Kensico Cemetery]] in [[Valhalla, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://allstar.fiu.edu/aero/quimby.htm |title=Aeronautics – Harriet Quimby |date=December 20, 2004 |website=Aeronautics Learning Laboratory for Science Technology and Research |publisher=[[Florida International University]] |access-date=April 13, 2018 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
A 1991 United States [[Airmails of the United States|airmail]] [[List of people on stamps of the United States#Q|postage stamp]] featured Quimby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sama|first1=Dominic|title=Stamp Honors First Woman Licensed Pilot|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1991-04-28/entertainment/9102070488_1_self-addressed-envelopes-commemorative-stamp-postal-service|accessdate=October 3, 2016|work=Chicago Tribune|agency=Knight-Ridder Newspapers|date=April 28, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She is memorialized in two official Michigan historical markers. One is located near [[Coldwater, Michigan|Coldwater]] where she was born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Harriet Quimby|url=http://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=67528|website=The Historical Marker database|accessdate=October 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other was erected near the now abandoned farmhouse in [[Arcadia Township, Manistee County, Michigan|Arcadia Township]] where Quimby grew up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Harriet Quimby Childhood Home|url=http://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=97460|website=The Historical Marker database|accessdate=October 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2004 Quimby was inducted into the [[National Aviation Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref name=NAHoF/&gt;

In 2012 Quimby was inducted into the Long Island Air and Space Hall of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sentinelandenterprise.com/local/ci_20634833/fitchburg-pays-tribute-first-woman-fly-across-english#ixzz1v26meZbb|title=Fitchburg pays tribute to first woman to fly across English Channel|location=Fitchburg, Massachusetts|publisher=[[Sentinel &amp; Enterprise]]|first1=Alana|last1=Melanson|date=May 16, 2012|accessdate=May 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Old Rhinebeck Aerodrome]] possesses a flyable [[Anzani]]-powered one-seater [[Blériot XI]], which bears the Blériot factory's serial number 56, showing that it was manufactured in 1909. Since Quimby's plane, in 1912, was a brand new two-seater, the idea that the former was the aircraft that she was flying in 1912 seems to be an [[urban legend]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Pat Trenner|title=Did Harriet Quimby’s Blériot End Up in New York?|url=http://www.airspacemag.com/daily-planet/did-harriet-quimbys-bleriot-end-up-in-new-york-22770842/|publisher=airspacemag|date=April 15, 2013|accessdate=March 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
