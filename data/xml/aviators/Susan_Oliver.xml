'''Susan Oliver''' (born '''Charlotte Gercke''', February 13, 1932 – May 10, 1990) was an American actress, television director and [[Pilot (aeronautics)|aviator]].

==Early life and family==
Susan Oliver was born the daughter of George Gercke, journalist, and [[Ruth Hale Oliver]], an [[astrology]] practitioner, in [[New York City]] in 1932. Her father was a political reporter and [[journalist]] for the ''[[New York World]]''. Her parents divorced when she was still a child. In June 1949, Oliver joined her mother in [[Southern California]], where Ruth was in the process of becoming a well known [[Hollywood]] astrologer. Oliver made a decision to embark upon a career as an actress and chose the stage name Susan Oliver.&lt;ref name="imdb"/&gt;

==Career==

===Early years===
By September 1949 and using her new name, Oliver returned to the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] to begin drama studies at [[Swarthmore College]], followed by professional training at the [[Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre]] in New York City. After working in [[summer stock]], regional theater and in unbilled bits in daytime and primetime TV shows and commercials, she made her first major television appearance in a supporting role in the July 31, 1955, episode of the live drama series ''Goodyear TV Playhouse,'' and quickly progressed to leading parts in other shows.

Oliver did numerous TV shows in 1957, and appeared on stage. She began the year with an [[Ingenue (stock character)|ingenue]] part, as the daughter of an 18th-century [[Manhattan]] family, in her first Broadway play, ''Small War on Murray Hill,'' a [[Robert E. Sherwood]] comedy.&lt;ref&gt;The play's opening night at the [[Ethel Barrymore Theatre]] was on January 3, 1957, and, 12 performances later, closing night was January 12. [[Leo Genn]] as [[General Howe]]&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, Oliver replaced [[Mary Ure]] as the female lead in the Broadway production of [[John Osborne]]'s play ''[[Look Back in Anger]].''

The play's short run was immediately followed by larger roles in live TV plays on ''Kaiser Aluminum Hour,'' ''[[The United States Steel Hour]]'' and ''Matinee Theater.'' Oliver then went to [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]], where she appeared in the November 14, 1957, episode of ''[[Climax! (TV series)|Climax!]],'' one of the few live drama series based on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], as well as in a number of filmed shows, including one of the first episodes of [[NBC]]'s ''[[Wagon Train]],'' ''[[Father Knows Best]],'' ''[[The Americans (1961 TV series)|The Americans]],'' and ''[[Johnny Staccato]].''

In July 1957, Oliver was chosen for the title role in her first motion picture, ''[[The Green-Eyed Blonde]],'' a low-budget [[independent film|independent]] [[melodrama]] scripted by [[Dalton Trumbo]] (under a pseudonym), and released by [[Warner Bros.]] in December on the bottom half of a double bill.&lt;ref&gt;The film was scripted by [[Hollywood blacklist|blacklisted]] writer [[Dalton Trumbo]] and credited to "[[Hollywood blacklist|front]]" Sally Stubblefield.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the only motion picture on which Oliver received top billing.

In mid-1958, Oliver began rehearsals for a co-starring role in ''Patate,'' her second Broadway play.&lt;ref&gt;The melancholy comedy, written by [[France|French]] playwright [[Marcel Achard]], played to sold-out theaters in [[Paris]] upon its premiere in 1957. Adapted for American audiences by [[Irwin Shaw]], ''Patate'' (which in [[French language|French]] means "[[Wiktionary:spud|spud]]", but can also mean "[[Wiktionary:chump|chump]]") paired Oliver with veteran leading man [[Tom Ewell]] (in the title role) and [[Lee Bowman]]. The play opened at [[Henry Miller's Theatre]] on October 28, 1958, and closed on November 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Its seven performance run was even shorter than that of ''Small War on Murray Hill,'' but won Oliver a [[Theatre World Award]] for "Outstanding Breakout Performance;" it was her last Broadway appearance.

===Television and films===

On April 6, 1960, the 28-year-old Oliver played a spoiled young runaway, Maggie Hamilton, in "The Maggie Hamilton Story" on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Wagon Train]]''. Flint McCullough, played by [[Robert Horton (actor)|Robert Horton]], searches for her so the wagon train can proceed on schedule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0743192/|title=The Maggie Hamilton Story|publisher=[[Internet Movie Data Base]]|accessdate=May 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 9, 1960, she was cast as the lead guest star in "The Cathy Eckhart Story" on ''Wagon Train'', with husband-and-wife actors [[John Larch]] and [[Vivi Janiss]] as Ben and Sarah Harness.

Oliver was cast in the 1960 episode of ''[[The Deputy (TV series)|The Deputy]]'' as the long-lost daughter of star [[Henry Fonda]]'s late girl friend, and appeared in ''[[Dick Powell's Zane Grey Theatre]]'' episode "Knife of Hate" as Susan Pittman. In 1961, Oliver played the part of Laurie Evans in the episode "Incident of His Brother's Keeper" on CBS's ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]'', and in 1963, she played Judy Hall in the episode "Incident at Spider Rock", Also in 1962 Oliver appeared as Jeanie in the television series ''[[Laramie (TV series)|Laramie]]'' in the episode "Shadows in the Dust".

Oliver was cast in episodes of ''[[Adventures in Paradise (TV series)|Adventures in Paradise]]'', ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|Twilight Zone]]'', ''[[Route 66 (TV series)|Route 66]]'', ''[[Dr. Kildare]]'', ''[[The Naked City]]'', ''[[The Barbara Stanwyck Show]]'', ''[[Burke's Law (1963 TV series)|Burke's Law]]'', ''[[The Fugitive (TV series)|The Fugitive]]'', ''[[Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.]]'', ''[[I Spy (1965 TV series)|I Spy]]'', ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]'', and ''[[The Name of the Game (TV series)|The Name of the Game]]''. She made one appearance on ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'' and ABC's family western series, ''[[The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters (TV series)|The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters]]''. She also made two appearances in ''"The Invaders"'' (eps. "Inquisition" and "The Ivy Curtain").

Her most challenging role during this time was as the ambitious wife of doomed country music legend Hank Williams (George Hamilton) in ''[[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|Your Cheatin' Heart]]'' (1964). The same year she also starred opposite [[Jerry Lewis]] in ''[[The Disorderly Orderly]]'', and also appeared in ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E]]'' (1965), and ''[[The Love-Ins]]'' (1967) with [[Richard Todd]].

Oliver appeared in television films including ''[[Carter's Army]]''. Oliver had a continuing role as Ann Howard on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s prime-time serial ''[[Peyton Place (TV series)|Peyton Place]]'' in 1966.

Oliver played the female lead character Vina in "[[The Cage (Star Trek: The Original Series)|The Cage]]" (1964), which was the first pilot of [[Gene Roddenberry]]'s new show, ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]''. Two years later, Oliver's performance was re-used in the first season, two-part episode "[[The Menagerie (Star Trek: The Original Series)|The Menagerie]]" (1966). The framing device was needed because of significant format and cast changes, in particular [[Jeffrey Hunter]] played "[[Captain Christopher Pike]]" in the pilot episode, but [[William Shatner]] became the new captain of the [[Starship Enterprise]] when the series was green-lit in 1966.
For the fantasy sequence in the pilot, in which her character appeared as an "Orion slave girl", Oliver was covered in green makeup all over her body, and a dark brunette wig.&lt;ref name=asherman&gt;{{cite book|last=Asherman|first=Allan|title=The Star Trek Compendium|publisher=WH Allen, Star Books|year=1983|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; A still of her with green skin is frequently seen in the end credits of the [[TV series]], and it became an iconic image of ''Star Trek''. Hence the documentary about Susan Oliver's life in 2014 was titled ''The Green Girl''.&lt;ref name=ew&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2013/02/13/star-treks-green-girl-documentary|date=13 Feb 2013|accessdate=31 Dec 2015|publisher=ew.com - Entertainment Weekly|title=Star Trek's original Green Girl the subject of Kickstarter documentary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1975 to 1976, Oliver was a regular cast member of the TV soap opera ''[[Days of Our Lives]]''. In 1976, she received her only [[Emmy Award|Emmy Award nomination]] (for "Outstanding Performance by a Supporting Actress") in the three-hour-long [[made-for-TV movie]] ''Amelia Earhart'', broadcast on October 15, 1976 on [[NBC-TV]].

In addition to her scores of television appearances, Oliver also had roles in several theatrical features including ''[[The Gene Krupa Story]]'' (1959), ''[[BUtterfield 8]]'' (1960), and ''[[The Caretakers]]'' (1963).&lt;ref name="imdb"/&gt;

===Directing and later years===
By the late 1970s with acting assignments becoming scarcer, Oliver turned to directing. She was one of the original 19 women admitted to the [[American Film Institute]]'s [[Directing Workshop for Women]] (AFI DWW) "who, upon her early death, left a good chunk of funding for the DWW."&lt;ref&gt;''WOMEN DIRECTORS IN HOLLYWOOD, The Founding of the Directing Workshop for Women of the American Film Institute, a History, THE DREAM OF THE MARBLE BRIDGE,'' http://janhaag.com/ESessays.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977, she wrote and directed ''Cowboysan'', her AFI DWW short film which presents the fantasy scenario of a Japanese actor and actress playing leads in an American [[western (genre)|western]]. Oliver directed two TV episodes, the October 25, 1982 installment of ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'' and the December 4, 1983 entry of one of its sequel series, ''[[Trapper John, M.D.]]''.&lt;ref name="imdb"&gt;{{IMDb name|0647010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Oliver's last fully active years, she also appeared in the February 21, 1985 episode of ''[[Magnum, P.I.]]'', two episodes of ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'' (March 31 and December 1), the February 12, 1987 episode of ''[[Simon &amp; Simon]]'', and the January 10, 1988 episode of the [[NBC]] domestic drama ''[[Our House (1986 TV series)|Our House]]''. She made her last onscreen appearance in the November 6, 1988 episode of the syndicated horror anthology ''[[Freddy's Nightmares]]''. During her career in Hollywood, Oliver appeared in more than one hundred television programs.&lt;ref name="imdb"/&gt;

==Aviator and author==
Oliver experienced an event in February 1959 that underscored her later aviation accomplishments. She was a passenger aboard [[Pan Am Flight 115]], a [[Boeing 707]] on a transatlantic flight from [[Paris]] to [[New York City]] when it dropped from {{convert|35000|ft}} to {{convert|6000|ft}}. It was February 3, 1959, the same day [[Buddy Holly]] died in an airplane crash. These events caused her to avoid flying for the next year, even turning down job offers (with the exception of auditioning for ''[[BUtterfield 8]]'') if they were so short notice she could only travel by air. She eventually underwent hypnosis to overcome her fear of flying.&lt;ref name=odyssey/&gt;

In July 1964, [[Hal Fishman]] introduced her to personal flying when he took her on an evening flight over [[Los Angeles]] in a [[Cessna 172]].&lt;ref name=odyssey&gt;{{cite book|last=Oliver|first=Susan|title=Odyssey: A Daring Transatlantic Journey|publisher=Macmillan Publishing Co.|year=1983|isbn=0-02-592920-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The experience motivated her to return the next day to the [[Santa Monica Airport]] to begin training for a Private Pilot certificate. In 1966, while preparing for her own transatlantic flight, she was a passenger in a [[Piper J-3 Cub]] when the pilot ran into wires while "show-boating";&lt;ref name=odyssey /&gt; the airplane flipped and crashed. She and the pilot escaped injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ntsb.gov/aviationquery/brief.aspx?ev_id=75958&amp;key=0|title=NTSB No. LAX67D0086|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, piloting her own [[Aero Commander 200]], she became the fourth&lt;!--History records Amelia Earhart as the first woman to fly across the Atlantic, she did it alone in a Lockheed Vega in 1932. Gerry Mock did it in 1964 in a [[Cessna 180]] as part of the first solo round-the-world flight by a woman. Sheila Scott did it in 1966, also as part of a solo round the world flight, her transatlantic segment departed from New York.--&gt; woman to fly a single-engine aircraft solo across the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and the second to do it from New York City. Although she was attempting to fly to [[Moscow]], her odyssey ended in [[Denmark]] after the government of the [[Soviet Union]] denied her permission to enter its air space. She wrote about her aviation exploits and philosophy of life in an autobiography published in 1983.&lt;ref name=odyssey/&gt;

In 1968, she was contacted by Learjet to see if she was interested in getting a type rating in one of their jets with the intent to set record flights for them. She earned the rating and even flew some charters (having by that time acquired a commercial pilot certificate in single and multiengine land airplanes), but did not fly any record flights in their jets.&lt;ref name=odyssey/&gt;

In 1970, Oliver co-piloted a [[Piper PA-24 Comanche|Piper Comanche]] to victory in the 2760-mile transcontinental race known as the "[[Powder Puff Derby (1947)|Powder Puff Derby]]", which resulted in her being named Pilot of the Year. The pilot was Margaret Mead (not the famous anthropologist), an experienced pilot who had flown in several derbies with different co-pilots. In 1972, her training for a glider rating was chronicled for an episode of the television series ''[[The American Sportsman]]'' and the segment aired in March 1973.&lt;ref&gt;[https://newspaperarchive.com/robesonian/1973-03-18/page-27 Robesonian newspaper archives], March 18, 1973; accessed March 7, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''FAA Registry'', the glider rating was issued to Oliver on July 21, 1972. It was her last rating. ''The Registry'' shows her to have earned commercial pilot ratings for airplane single engine land, airplane multiengine land, instrument airplane, and private privileges for glider. Her last aviation medical exam was in May 1976; therefore, she could not legally pilot any aircraft except gliders after May 1978, marking the end of her piloting of powered aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;[https://amsrvs.registry.faa.gov/airmeninquiry Profile], amsrvs.registry.faa.gov; accessed March 7, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Oliver was diagnosed with colorectal cancer that later metastasized to her lungs and she died on May 10, 1990 at the [[Motion Picture &amp; Television Hospital]] in [[Woodland Hills, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/15/obituaries/susan-oliver-is-dead-television-actress-61.html|title=Susan Oliver Is Dead; Television Actress|newspaper=New York Times|date=1990-05-15|accessdate=January 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
