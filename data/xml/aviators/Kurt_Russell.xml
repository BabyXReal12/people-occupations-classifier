While in the field turning the pivot of a [[double play]] early in the season, the incoming runner at second base collided with him and tore the [[rotator cuff]] in Russell's right (throwing) shoulder. He did not return to El Paso, but was a [[designated hitter]] for the independent [[Portland Mavericks]] back in the Northwest League late in their short season. The team was owned by his father, and he had been doing promotional work for them in the interim.&lt;ref name=wkrtjmros&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=GDpYAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=WvcDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4325%2C2505341 |newspaper=The Bulletin|location=Bend, Oregon|agency=Associated Press |title=Wise, Kurt Russell to join Mavericks for rest of season|date=July 27, 1973 |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The injury forced his retirement from baseball in 1973 and led to his return to acting.&lt;ref name=bpkr&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=9JhJAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=coQMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1258,367525|newspaper=Youngstown Vindicator|location=Ohio|agency=Newhouse News Service |last=Freedman|first=Richard|title=Baseball player Kurt Russell banging out hits in new field |date=August 2, 1981|page=B6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the autumn of [[1974 in television|1974]], he appeared in the ABC series ''[[The New Land (TV series)|The New Land]]'', inspired by the [[1972 in film|1972]] [[Sweden|Swedish]] film of the [[The New Land|same name]]. Critically acclaimed, it suffered very low ratings and only aired six of the 13 episodes. In 1976, Russell appeared with [[Tim Matheson]] in the 15-episode NBC series ''[[The Quest (1976 TV series)|The Quest]]''{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} In 1980, Russell was nominated for an [[Emmy Award]] for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited Series or a Special for the made-for-television film ''[[Elvis (1979 film)|Elvis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nominees/Winners|url=http://www.emmys.com/awards/nominees-winners/1979 |website=Television Academy|accessdate=May 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1980s, Russell teamed with Carpenter several times, helping create some of his best-known roles, usually as [[anti-hero]]es, including the infamous [[Snake Plissken]] of ''[[Escape from New York]]'' and its sequel, ''[[Escape from L.A.]]''. Among their collaborations was ''[[The Thing (1982 film)|The Thing]]'' (1982), based upon the short story ''[[Who Goes There?]]'' by [[John W. Campbell, Jr.]], which had been interpreted on film before, albeit loosely, in 1951's ''[[The Thing from Another World]]''. In 1986, Russell played a truck driver caught in an ancient Chinese war in ''[[Big Trouble in Little China]]'', which was a financial failure like ''The Thing'' and has since gained a cult audience. He was nominated for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture]] for his performance in ''[[Silkwood]]'' (1983).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goldenglobes.com/film/silkwood|title=Silkwood|website=Golden Globes|accessdate=March 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990–present===
[[File:Kurt Russell.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Russell in 2005]]
Russell played Lt. Stephen "Bull" McCaffrey in ''[[Backdraft (film)|Backdraft]]'' (1991), [[Wyatt Earp]] in ''[[Tombstone (film)|Tombstone]]'' (1993) and Colonel Jack O'Neil in the [[military science fiction]] film ''[[Stargate (film)|Stargate]]'' (1994). His portrayal of U.S. Olympic hockey coach [[Herb Brooks]] in the 2004 film ''[[Miracle (2004 film)|Miracle]]'', won the praise of critics. "In many ways", wrote Claudia Puig of ''[[USA Today]]'', "''Miracle'' belongs to Kurt Russell." [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' wrote, "Russell does real acting here."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/miracle-2004|title=Miracle Movie Review &amp; Film Summary (2004) {{!}} Roger Ebert|last=Ebert|first=Roger|website=www.rogerebert.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elvis Mitchell]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, "Mr. Russell&lt;nowiki&gt;'s cagey and remote performance gives ''Miracle''&lt;/nowiki&gt; its few breezes of fresh air. "&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/06/movies/film-review-a-hollywood-ending-from-real-life.html|title=FILM REVIEW; A Hollywood Ending From Real Life|last=Mitchell|first=Elvis|date=2004-02-06|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-05-09|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Russell claimed in one interview that [[George P. Cosmatos]] had ghost-directed the hit 1993 western film ''[[Tombstone (film)|Tombstone]]'' on Russell's behalf, saying he gave Cosmatos shot lists.&lt;ref name="beck"&gt;Beck, Henry Cabot.{{cite web|url=http://www.truewestmagazine.com/archives/westerns/2006/western-russell_godfather_10_06.htm|title=Archived copy |accessdate=December 10, 2007|deadurl=unfit|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070122213246/http://www.truewestmagazine.com/archives/westerns/2006/western-russell_godfather_10_06.htm |archivedate=January 22, 2007}} ''True West Magazine'', October 2006; accessed May 6, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Russell claimed [[Sylvester Stallone]] recommended Cosmatos to him after the removal of the first director, writer [[Kevin Jarre]], but Cosmatos had also worked with ''Tombstone'' executive producer [[Andrew G. Vajna]] before on ''[[Rambo: First Blood Part II]]''. Russell said he promised Cosmatos he would keep it a secret as long as Cosmatos was alive; Cosmatos died in April 2005.&lt;ref name="beck"/&gt; Russell said he didn’t get a chance to edit his version, but Vajna gave him a tape of "everything on the movie" and that he might try to "reconstruct the movie", although he would need to go back to the script and all his notes.&lt;ref name="beck"/&gt;

Russell played the villainous Stuntman Mike in [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s segment ''[[Death Proof]]'' of the film ''[[Grindhouse (film)|Grindhouse]]''. After a remake of ''Escape from New York'' was announced, Russell was reportedly upset with [[Gerard Butler]] for playing his signature character, Snake Plissken, as he believed the character 'was quintessentially [...] American.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Stax|url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/775/775013p1.html |title=IGN: Kurt Blasts 'Escape' Remake|publisher=Movies.ign.com|date=March 22, 2007 |accessdate=August 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pr-inside.com/russell-enraged-with-new-snake-plissken-r75552.htm |title=News Russell Enraged with New Snake Plissken |publisher=Pr-inside.com |accessdate=August 15, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610002318/http://www.pr-inside.com/russell-enraged-with-new-snake-plissken-r75552.htm |archivedate=June 10, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
