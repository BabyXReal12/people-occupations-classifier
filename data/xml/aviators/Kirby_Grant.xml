'''Kirby Grant''' (November 24, 1911 – October 30, 1985), born '''Kirby Grant Hoon Jr.''', was a long-time [[B movie]] and [[television]] [[actor]], mostly remembered for having played the title role in the [[Western (genre)|Western]]-themed [[adventure]] [[television series]] ''[[Sky King]]''. Between 1949 and 1954, Grant played the title role in the series of ten  [[Corporal Rod Webb (film series)|Corporal Rod Webb]] films.

==Early life and career==
Grant was born in [[Butte, Montana|Butte]] in [[Silver Bow County, Montana|Silver Bow County]] in southwestern [[Montana]]. He was a [[child prodigy]] [[violin]]ist. He continued to study music and became a professional [[singer]] and bandleader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://members.cox.net/skykingtv/skykingt.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2002-12-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021227065827/http://members.cox.net/skykingtv/skykingt.html |archivedate=2002-12-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Movie career==
In 1939 the ''[[Gateway to Hollywood]]'' talent-search contest awarded him a movie contract. These "Gateway" contracts were already prepared with fictitious [[Stage name|screen names]] (thus Josephine Cottle became "[[Gale Storm]]" and Ralph Bowman became "[[John Archer (actor)|John Archer]]"; Grant won with Dorothy Howe, who became "[[Virginia Vale]]"). Grant's contract was made out to "Robert Stanton," and Grant used the pseudonym in his earliest films before adopting his first and middle names professionally. "Robert Stanton" and "Virginia Vale" were introduced in the [[RKO Radio Pictures]] feature ''Three Sons'', with Edward Ellis and [[William Gargan]]. For the next few years Grant freelanced among various studios; his most familiar picture from this period (as Kirby Grant) is probably ''Blondie Goes Latin'', a 1941 film with [[Penny Singleton]] and [[Arthur Lake (actor)|Arthur Lake]].

In 1943, Grant signed with [[Universal Pictures]], where he played romantic leads in B musicals, and in [[Abbott and Costello]] and [[Olsen and Johnson]] comedies. His smooth baritone voice got him teamed with Universal's singing star [[Gloria Jean]] for two features in 1944, and then Universal selected him to replace [[Rod Cameron (actor)|Rod Cameron]] (who had just been promoted to more important roles) as the studio's B-[[western (genre)|Western]] series star in 1945.  Grant also appeared briefly in the 1943 submarine picture [[Destination Tokyo]], playing the role of Lieutenant Colonel James H. Doolittle, organizer of the famous [[Doolittle Raid]] on Japan.

These seven westerns established Kirby Grant as an action star. In the late 1940s [[Monogram Pictures]] hired him for a series of mounted-police adventures, featuring "Chinook the Wonder Dog." Grant was working in this capacity when television beckoned in 1951 with the contemporary series ''Sky King''.

==''Sky King''==
Grant starred in the series ''Sky King'' during its entire run from 1951 to 1959, filming 72 episodes in all. He played [[Arizona]] rancher-pilot Schuyler "Sky" King, who fought bad guys and rescued people with his airplane. Early villains were bank robbers and kidnappers; some later foils were Russian spies and saboteurs. Sky's first airplane was a [[Cessna T-50]] (known among pilots as the "Bamboo Bomber" because of its wooden wings), and later a much more modern [[Cessna 310]]B. Sky's airplanes were named "Songbird". Sky and his niece Penny, played by [[Gloria Winters]], lived on the "Flying Crown Ranch". The series called for Grant to wear the same outfit in each episode. This was a common practice in the early days of television: the series regulars in ''[[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|Adventures of Superman]]'' and ''[[Dragnet (series)|Dragnet]]'', for example, always wore the same outfits so different episodes could be filmed at the same time, and file footage could be added to new footage without anyone noticing.

==Later appearances and retirement==
Grant did little acting after ''Sky King'' ended, although he and Gloria Winters were in demand for personal appearances at fairs and aviation events. He traveled with the Carson and Barnes Circus from 1965 to 1967. Grant retired in 1970. ''Sky King'' continued to play in reruns from 1959 to 1966, but Grant received no residuals.

Grant and his wife, Carolyn, had three children. In the early 1970s, the Grants moved from [[California]] to [[Florida]].

The couple founded the nonprofit Sky King Youth Ranches of America, which provided homes for abandoned or orphaned children. He had plans to resurrect the ''Sky King'' series with the Flying Crown Ranch becoming a home for such kids, and publicizing their stories, but it never materialized.

==Death==
At about 8&amp;nbsp;a.m. on October 30, 1985, Grant was killed in an automobile accident west of [[Titusville, Florida|Titusville]] in [[Brevard County, Florida|Brevard County]], Florida. Three vehicles were traveling east bound in single file, Grant was in the third vehicle. He pulled out of line (to the left) to pass both vehicles in front of him, when the middle vehicle also pulled out to pass at the same time. To avoid a collision, Grant suddenly swerved further left, and went onto the shoulder of the oncoming lane, he then over-corrected back all the way to the right, when his vehicle left the roadway and spun into a ditch, which contained three feet of standing water. Grant was thrown out of his car and into the water. A passerby pulled him out, and he was taken to [[Parrish Medical Center|Jess Parrish Hospital]] in Titusville, but was dead on arrival. That morning, Grant was en route from his condominium in [[Winter Springs, Florida|Winter Spings]] to the [[Kennedy Space Center]] to watch the ([[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|last successful]]) launch of the [[Space Shuttle Challenger]] at [[Cape Canaveral]].&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|3uIobms4kYg|Headline News – on the Death of Sky King, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was to have been honored by the astronauts for encouraging aviation and space flight. He was 73 years old.  Kirby is interred in [[Missoula, Montana|Missoula]], Montana.

== Recording career ==
Kirby Grant is listed as the recording artist on two [[Wizard Records]] singles, #245-A "Loving Time" and 245-B "Letter from Tina" circa 1970.

== Grant's pilot status ==
{{Original research section|date=May 2009}} 
{{Essay-like|section|an investigative report|date=May 2009}}
According to Kirby Grant III, his father was a pilot, and the two flew together many times. Grant was rejected for pilot training during [[World War II]] because of [[color blindness]]. In the article "310 B Goes To Hollywood," Bill Fergusson, the show's usual stunt pilot on loan from the [[Cessna|Cessna Aircraft Company]], recalled how Grant flew the 310B like a professional. According to Gloria Winters, Grant started his flying career in a 1929 [[Waco Aircraft Company|Waco]].

As in his television series, Grant was a rancher and flier. His ranch was located in [[Valley Center, California|Valley Center]], California.  His home was on Valley Center Road at the end of his private airstrip.(4)

It has been reported that Kirby Grant's pilot's license was issued in 1929. There are many anecdotal reports of Grant flying airplanes at air shows.
