&lt;strong&gt;Charles Augustus Lindbergh&lt;/strong&gt; (February 4, 1902 – August 26, 1974), nicknamed '''Lucky Lindy''', '''The Lone Eagle''', and '''Slim'''&lt;ref&gt;Every and Tracy 1927, pp. 60, 84, 91, 208.&lt;/ref&gt; was an American aviator, military officer, author, inventor, explorer, and environmental activist. At age 25 in 1927, he went from obscurity as a [[U.S. Air Mail]] pilot to instantaneous world fame by winning the [[Orteig Prize]]: making a nonstop flight from [[Roosevelt Field (airport)|Roosevelt Field]], [[Long Island]], [[New York (state)|New York]], to [[Paris]], France. Lindbergh covered the {{frac|33|1|2}}-hour, {{convert|3,600|smi|km}} alone in a single-engine purpose-built Ryan [[monoplane]], ''[[Spirit of St. Louis]]''. This was not the [[Transatlantic flight of Alcock and Brown|first flight between North America and Europe]], but he did achieve the first solo [[transatlantic flight]] and the first non-stop flight between North America and the European mainland. Lindbergh was an officer in the [[United States Army Reserve|U.S. Army Air Corps Reserve]], and he received the United States' highest military decoration, the [[Medal of Honor]], for the feat.{{sfn |Bryson |2013 |pp=25–104}}

His achievement spurred interest in both commercial aviation and air mail, and Lindbergh himself devoted much time and effort to promoting such activity. Lindbergh's historic flight and celebrity status led to tragedy. In March 1932, his infant son, Charles Jr., [[Lindbergh kidnapping|was kidnapped and murdered]] in what American media called the "Crime of the Century" and described by [[H. L. Mencken|H.&amp;nbsp;L.&amp;nbsp;Mencken]] as "the biggest story since the [[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection]]".&lt;ref&gt;Newton 2012, [http://www.mcfarlandbooks.com/book-2.php?id=978-0-7864-6620-7 p. 197] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170204202216/http://www.mcfarlandbooks.com/book-2.php?id=978-0-7864-6620-7 |date=February 4, 2017 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The case prompted the United States Congress to establish [[Federal Kidnapping Act|kidnapping]] as a federal crime once the kidnapper had crossed state lines with their victim. By late 1935 the hysteria surrounding the case had driven the Lindbergh family into voluntary exile in Europe, from which they returned in 1939.

Before the United States formally entered [[World War II]], some people accused Lindbergh of being a [[fascism|fascist]] sympathizer. An advocate of [[non-interventionism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charleslindbergh.com/americanfirst/|title=Charles Lindbergh's Noninterventionist Efforts &amp; America First Committee|website=www.charleslindbergh.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; he supported the antiwar [[America First Committee]], which opposed American aid to Britain in its war against Germany, and resigned his commission in the [[United States Army Air Forces]] in 1941 after President [[Franklin Roosevelt]] publicly rebuked him for his views. Nevertheless, he publicly supported the U.S. war effort after the [[Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor]] and flew fifty combat missions in the [[Pacific War|Pacific Theater]] of World War II as a civilian consultant{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}, though Roosevelt refused to reinstate his Air Corps colonel's commission.
In his later years, Lindbergh became a prolific prize-winning author, international explorer, inventor, and environmentalist.

Lindbergh and his wife, the former [[Anne Morrow]], were the parents of six children. In 2003—twenty-nine years after Lindbergh's death and two years after his wife died—it was revealed that beginning in 1957 (when he was 55 years old), Lindbergh had engaged in several covert adulterous affairs with three European women, with whom he fathered seven more children, none of whom learned of their  father's true identity until a decade after his 1974 death.

==Rise to fame==
===Early childhood===
[[File:Charles&amp;Dad.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.75|Charles A. Lindbergh and his father, circa 1910]]

Lindbergh was born in [[Detroit]], Michigan, on {{nowrap|February 4}}, 1902, and spent most of his childhood in [[Little Falls, Minnesota]], and Washington, D.C. He was the third child of [[Charles August Lindbergh]] ([[Name at birth|birth name]] Carl Månsson; 1859–1924) who had emigrated from Sweden to [[Melrose, Minnesota]] as an infant, and his only child with his second wife, Evangeline Lodge Land Lindbergh (1876–1954), of Detroit. Charles' parents separated in 1909 when he was seven.&lt;ref&gt;Larson 1973, pp. 31–32.&lt;/ref&gt; Lindbergh's father, a [[United States Congress|U.S. Congressman]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-[[Minnesota|MN]]-6) from 1907 to 1917, was one of the few Congressmen to oppose the entry of the U.S. into World War I (although his Congressional term ended one month prior to the House of Representatives voting to declare war on Germany).&lt;ref&gt;Larson 1973, pp. 208–209.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lindbergh's mother was a chemistry teacher at [[Cass Technical High School]] in Detroit and later at Little Falls High School, from which her son graduated on {{nowrap|June 5}}, 1918. Lindbergh also attended over a dozen other schools from Washington, D.C., to California, during his childhood and teenage years (none for more than a year or two), including the Force School and [[Sidwell Friends School]] while living in Washington with his father, and [[Redondo Union High School]] in [[Redondo Beach, California]], while living there with his mother.&lt;ref&gt;Lindbergh 1927, pp. 19–22.&lt;/ref&gt; Although he enrolled in the College of Engineering at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] in late 1920, Lindbergh dropped out in the middle of his sophomore year and then went to [[Lincoln, Nebraska]], in March 1922 to begin flight training.&lt;ref&gt;Lindbergh 1927, pp.&amp;nbsp;22–25.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early aviation career===
[[File:Lincoln Standard biplane.jpg|thumb|left|[[Standard J|Lincoln Standard J]] biplane]]

From an early age, Lindbergh had exhibited an interest in the mechanics of motorized transportation, including his family's [[Saxon (automobile)|Saxon Six]] automobile, and later his [[Excelsior Motor Manufacturing &amp; Supply Company|Excelsior]] motorbike. By the time he started college as a [[mechanical engineering]] student, he had also become fascinated with flying, though he "had never been close enough to a plane to touch it".&lt;ref&gt;Lindbergh 1927, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; After quitting college in February 1922, Lindbergh enrolled at the Nebraska Aircraft Corporation's flying school in Lincoln and flew for the first time on {{nowrap|April 9}}, as a passenger in a two-seat [[Standard J|Lincoln Standard "Tourabout"]] biplane trainer piloted by [[Otto Timm]].&lt;ref&gt;Lindbergh 1927, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

A few days later, Lindbergh took his first formal flying lesson in that same machine, though he was never permitted to solo because he could not afford to post the requisite damage bond.&lt;ref&gt;Lindbergh 1927, pp. 26–28.&lt;/ref&gt; To gain flight experience and earn money for further instruction, Lindbergh left Lincoln in June to spend the next few months [[barnstorming]] across Nebraska, Kansas, Colorado, Wyoming, and Montana as a [[wing walking|wing walker]] and [[Parachuting|parachutist]]. He also briefly worked as an airplane mechanic at the [[Billings, Montana]], municipal airport.&lt;ref&gt;Lindbergh 1927, pp. 29–36.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Westover, Lee Ann.

[[File:"Daredevil Lindbergh".jpg|thumb|right|"Daredevil Lindbergh" in a re-engined Standard J-1, the plane in this photo often misidentified as a Curtiss "Jenny", probably 1925]]

Lindbergh left flying with the onset of winter and returned to his father's home in Minnesota.&lt;ref&gt;Lindbergh 1927, pp. 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt; His return to the air and first solo flight did not come until half a year later in May 1923 at [[Jimmy Carter Regional Airport|Souther Field]] in [[Americus, Georgia]], a former Army flight training field, where he had come to buy a World War I surplus [[Curtiss JN-4|Curtiss JN-4 "Jenny"]] biplane. Though Lindbergh had not touched an airplane in more than six months, he had already secretly decided he was ready to take to the air by himself. After a half-hour of dual time with a pilot who was visiting the field to pick up another surplus JN-4, Lindbergh flew solo for the first time in the Jenny he had just purchased for $500.&lt;ref&gt;Lindbergh 1927, pp. 39–43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charleslindbergh.com/plane/firstplane.asp "Charles Lindbergh's First Solo Flight &amp; First Plane"]. Charles Lindbergh official site. Retrieved: February 15, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; After spending another week or so at the field to "practice" (thereby acquiring five hours of "pilot in command" time), Lindbergh took off from Americus for [[Montgomery, Alabama]], some 140 miles to the west, for his first solo cross-country flight.&lt;ref&gt;Lindbergh 1927, pp. 43–44.&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to spend much of the rest of 1923 engaged in almost nonstop barnstorming under the name of "Daredevil Lindbergh". Unlike the previous year, this time Lindbergh flew in his "own ship" as pilot.&lt;ref&gt;Lindbergh 1927, pp. 44–45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/lindbergh/sfeature/daredevil.html "Daredevil Lindbergh and His Barnstorming Days"] ''American Experience'', PBS (WGBH), 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; A few weeks after leaving Americus, the young airman also achieved another key aviation milestone when he made his first flight at night near [[Lake Village, Arkansas]].&lt;ref&gt;Lindbergh 1927, pp. 63–65.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Charles Lindbergh 1925.JPG|thumb|left|upright=0.75|2nd Lt. Charles A. Lindbergh, USASRC March 1925]]

While Lindbergh was barnstorming in [[Lone Rock, Wisconsin]], on two occasions he flew a local physician across the Wisconsin River to emergency calls that were otherwise unreachable due to flooding.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Susan Lampert "Dr. Bertha Stories: Dr. Bertha's Decades in the River Valley Included remarkable Medical Feats". ''Wisconsin State Journal'', April 20, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; He broke his propeller several times while landing, and on {{nowrap|June 3}}, 1923 he was grounded for a week when he ran into a ditch in [[Glencoe, Minnesota]] while flying his father—then running for the U.S. Senate—to a campaign stop. In October, Lindbergh flew his Jenny to [[Iowa]], where he sold it to a flying student. After selling the Jenny, Lindbergh returned to Lincoln by train. There, he joined Leon Klink and continued to barnstorm through the South for the next few months in Klink's Curtiss JN-4C "Canuck" (the Canadian version of the Jenny). Lindbergh also "cracked up" this aircraft once when his engine failed shortly after take-off in [[Pensacola, Florida]], but again he managed to repair the damage himself.&lt;ref&gt;Lindbergh 1927, pp. 84–93.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a few months of barnstorming through the South, the two pilots parted company in [[San Antonio]], Texas, where Lindbergh reported to [[Brooks City-Base|Brooks Field]] on {{nowrap|March 19}}, 1924, to begin a year of military flight training with the [[United States Army Air Service]] there (and later at nearby [[Kelly Field Annex|Kelly Field]]).&lt;ref&gt;Berg 1998, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; Lindbergh had his most serious flying accident on {{nowrap|March 5}}, 1925, eight days before graduation, when a midair collision with another Army [[Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5|S.E.5]] during aerial combat maneuvers forced him to bail out.&lt;ref&gt;Lindbergh 1927, pp. 144–148.&lt;/ref&gt; Only 18 of the 104 cadets who started flight training a year earlier remained when Lindbergh graduated first overall in his class in March 1925, thereby earning his Army pilot's wings and a commission as a [[Second Lieutenant#United States|2nd Lieutenant]] in the [[Military reserve force|Air Service Reserve Corps]].&lt;ref&gt;Moseley 1976, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Dates of military rank: Cadet, Army Air Corps – March 19, 1924, 2nd Lieutenant, Officer Reserve Corps (ORC) – March 14, 1925, 1st Lieutenant, ORC – December 7, 1925, Captain, ORC – July 13, 1926, Colonel, ORC – July 18, 1927 (As of 1927, Lindbergh was a member of the Missouri National Guard and was assigned to the 110th Observation Squadron in St. Louis.&lt;ref&gt;Official National Guard Register. 1927. p. 529.&lt;/ref&gt;), Brigadier General, USAFR – April 7, 1954.&lt;ref&gt;Berg 1998, p. 488.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=N}}

Lindbergh later said that this year was critical to his development as both a focused, goal-oriented individual and as an aviator.{{refn|"Always there was some new experience, always something interesting going on to make the time spent at Brooks and Kelly one of the banner years in a pilot's life. The training is difficult and rigid, but there is none better. A cadet must be willing to forget all other interest in life when he enters the Texas flying schools and he must enter with the intention of devoting every effort and all of the energy during the next 12 months towards a single goal. But when he receives the wings at Kelly a year later, he has the satisfaction of knowing that he has graduated from one of the world's finest flying schools." ''"WE"'' p. 125 |group=N}} The Army did not need additional active-duty pilots, however, so immediately following graduation Lindbergh returned to civilian aviation as a barnstormer and [[flight instructor]], although as a reserve officer he also continued to do some part-time military flying by joining the [[110th Bomb Squadron|110th Observation Squadron]], 35th Division, Missouri [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]], in St. Louis. He was soon promoted to [[First Lieutenant#United States|1st Lieutenant]], and to captain in July 1926.&lt;ref name="American Aviator"&gt;[http://www.charleslindbergh.com/timeline/index.asp "Charles Lindbergh: An American Aviator"]. charleslindbergh.com. Retrieved: February 15, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Air Mail pilot===
[[File:CharlesLindbergh PostOfficeOath.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.1]]

In October 1925, Lindbergh was hired by the [[Robertson Aircraft Corporation]] (RAC) at the [[Lambert-St. Louis International Airport|Lambert-St. Louis Flying Field]] in Anglum, MO (where he had been working as a flight instructor) to first lay out and then serve as chief pilot for the newly designated {{convert|278|mi|km|adj=on}} [[Airmails of the United States#Beginning Contract Air Mail (CAM) service|Contract Air Mail]] Route #2 (CAM-2) to provide service between [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] and [[Chicago]] (Maywood Field) with two intermediate stops in [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]] and [[Peoria, Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charleslindbergh.com/mystory/thompson.asp "Robertson Aircraft Corporation"]. charleslindbergh.com.&lt;/ref&gt; Lindbergh and three other RAC pilots, Philip R. Love, Thomas P. Nelson, and [[Harlan Gurney|Harlan A. "Bud" Gurney]], flew the mail over CAM-2 in a fleet of four modified war-surplus [[Airco DH.4|de Havilland DH-4]] [[biplane]]s.

Just before signing on to fly with CAM, Lindbergh had applied to serve as a pilot on [[Richard E. Byrd]]'s North Pole expedition, but apparently his bid came too late.&lt;ref name=Berg&gt;Berg [http://www.us.penguingroup.com/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9781101494288,00.html?Lindbergh_A._Scott_Berg 1995, p. 95.]&lt;/ref&gt;

On {{nowrap|April 13}}, 1926, Lindbergh executed the Post Office Department's Oath of Mail Messengers,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charleslindbergh.com/pdf/lindyoath.pdf "Certificate of the Oath of Mail Messengers executed by Charles A. Lindbergh, Pilot, CAM-2, April 13, 1926"]. charleslindbergh.com.&lt;/ref&gt; and two days later he opened service on the new route. Twice combinations of bad weather, equipment failure, and fuel exhaustion forced him to bail out on night approach to Chicago;&lt;ref&gt;Lindbergh 1927, pp. 185–7, 192–3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lindbergh 1953, pp. 6-8"&gt;Lindbergh 1953, pp. 6–8.&lt;/ref&gt; both times he reached the ground without serious injury and immediately set about ensuring his cargo was located and sent on with minimum delay.&lt;ref name="Lindbergh 1953, pp. 6-8"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lindbergh 1927, pp. 185–193&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-February 1927 he left for [[San Diego]], California, to oversee design and construction of the ''Spirit of St. Louis''.&lt;ref&gt;Lindbergh 1953, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

==New York{{ndash}}Paris flight==
===Orteig Prize===
{{Main|Orteig Prize}}

The world's first nonstop transatlantic flight (though at 1,890{{nbsp}}mi, or 3,040{{nbsp}}km, far shorter than Lindbergh's 3,600{{nbsp}}mi, or 5,800{{nbsp}}km, flight) was made eight years earlier by British aviators [[Alcock and Brown|John Alcock and Arthur Whitten Brown]], in a modified [[Vickers Vimy]] IV bomber. They left [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's, Newfoundland]] on {{nowrap|June 14}}, 1919 and arrived in Ireland, the following day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aviation-history.com/airmen/alcock.htm "Alcock and Brown: The First Non-stop Aerial Crossing of the Atlantic"]. The Aviation History Online Museum. Retrieved: July 17, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the same time, French-born New York hotelier [[Raymond Orteig]] was approached by [[Augustus Post]], secretary of the Aero Club of America, and prompted to put up a $25,000 award for the first successful nonstop transatlantic flight specifically between New York City and Paris (in either direction) within five years after its establishment. When that time limit lapsed in 1924 without a serious attempt, Orteig renewed the offer for another five years, this time attracting a number of well-known, highly experienced, and well-financed contenders&lt;ref&gt;Lindbergh 1953, pp. 31, 74.&lt;/ref&gt;{{mdashb}}none of whom were successful. On {{nowrap|September 21}}, 1926 World War{{nbsp}}I French [[flying ace]] [[René Fonck]]'s [[Sikorsky S-35]] crashed on takeoff from [[Roosevelt Field]] in New York. U.S. Naval aviators [[Wooster and Davis|Noel Davis]] and [[Wooster and Davis|Stanton H. Wooster]] were killed at [[Langley Air Force Base|Langley Field]], Virginia on {{nowrap|April 26}}, 1927, while testing their [[Keystone Pathfinder]].

===''Spirit of St. Louis''===
[[File:Lindbergh check.jpg|thumb|right|Part of the funding for the ''Spirit of St. Louis'' came from Lindbergh's earnings as a U.S. Air Mail pilot.]]

Financing the operation of the historic flight was a challenge due to Lindbergh's obscurity, but two St. Louis businessmen eventually obtained a $15,000 bank loan. Lindbergh contributed $2,000 ($27,280.45 in 2017)&lt;ref&gt;[http://dollartimes.com/inflation/inflation.php?amount=2000&amp;year=1927 dollartimes.com] Retrieved July 3, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; of his own money and another $1,000 was donated by RAC. The total of $18,000 was far less than was available to Lindbergh's rivals.&lt;ref&gt;Lindbergh 1953, pp. 25, 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

The group tried to buy an "off-the-peg" single or multiengine monoplane from [[Wright Aeronautical]], then [[Travel Air]], and finally the newly formed [[Columbia Aircraft Corporation]], but all insisted on selecting the pilot as a condition of sale.&lt;ref&gt;"Air Race to Paris promised by backer of Bellanca plane" ''The New York Times'', April 16, 1927 p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Mail flyer chosen for Bellanca hop" ''The New York Times'', April 20, 1927 p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Acosta withdraws from Paris Flight" ''The New York Times'', April 29, 1927 p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; Finally the much smaller [[Ryan Aeronautical|Ryan Aircraft Company]] of San Diego agreed to design and build a custom monoplane for $10,580, and on {{nowrap|February 25}} a deal was formally closed.&lt;ref&gt;Lindbergh 1953, pp. 85–86.&lt;/ref&gt; Dubbed the ''[[Spirit of St. Louis]]'', the fabric-covered, single-seat, single-engine "Ryan NYP" high-wing monoplane ([[Civil Aeronautics Authority|CAB]] registration: N-X-211) was designed jointly by Lindbergh and the Ryan's chief engineer [[Donald A.

===Flight===
[[File:Charles Lindbergh and the Spirit of Saint Louis (Crisco restoration, with wings).jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.75|Lindbergh with the ''Spirit of St. Louis'' before his Paris flight]]

In the early morning of Friday, {{nowrap|May 20}}, 1927, Lindbergh took off from [[Roosevelt Field (airport)|Roosevelt Field]] across the Atlantic Ocean for Paris, France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgCIUUn7E-w|title=First Pictures Of Lindbergh As He Reaches Paris In Flight From New York|first=|last=AP Archive|date=July 24, 2015|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; His monoplane was loaded with 450 U.S. gallons (1,704 liters) of [[Aviation fuel|fuel]] that was strained repeatedly to avoid fuel line blockage. The fully loaded aircraft weighed {{convert|5135|lb|abbr=on}}, and takeoff was hampered by a muddy, rain-soaked runway. Lindbergh's monoplane was powered by a [[Wright R-790 Whirlwind|J-5C]] [[Wright Whirlwind]] radial engine and gained speed very slowly during its 7:52{{nbsp}}a.m. takeoff, but cleared telephone lines at the far end of the field "by about twenty feet [six meters] with a fair reserve of flying speed".&lt;ref&gt;Lindbergh 1927, p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next {{frac|33|1|2}} hours, Lindbergh and the ''Spirit'' faced many challenges, which included skimming over [[Cumulonimbus cloud|storm clouds]] at {{convert|10000|ft|m|abbr=on}} and wave tops at as low as {{convert|10|ft|m|abbr=on}}. The aircraft fought [[Icing conditions|icing]], flew blind through fog for several hours, and Lindbergh navigated only by [[Dead reckoning#Air navigation|dead reckoning]]. (He was not proficient at navigating [[Celestial navigation|by the sun and stars]] and he rejected [[radio navigation]] gear as heavy and unreliable. He was fortunate that the winds over the Atlantic cancelled each other out, giving him zero wind drift – and thus accurate navigation during the long flight over featureless ocean.)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.airspacemag.com/history-of-flight/even-lindbergh-got-lost-3381643/ Retrieved January 24, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hodinkee.com/articles/the-history-and-science-behind-the-lindbergh-longines-hour-angle-watch/ More on the navigational issues and one of his post-flight attempts to reduce them.

A crowd estimated at 150,000 stormed the field, dragged Lindbergh out of the cockpit, and literally carried him around above their heads for "nearly half an hour".

Even the first walk on the moon doesn't come close. The twenties was such an innocent time, and people were still so religious—I think they felt like this man was sent by God to do this. And it changed aviation forever because all of a sudden the [[Wall Street]]ers were banging on doors looking for airplanes to invest in. We'd been standing on our heads trying to get them to notice us but after Lindbergh, suddenly everyone wanted to fly, and there weren't enough planes to carry them.&lt;ref&gt;Jennings and Brewster 1998, p. 420.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Autobiography and tours===
{{Main|"WE" (1927 book)}}
Barely two months after Lindbergh arrived in Paris, G. P. Putnam's Sons published his 318-page autobiography ''"WE"'', which was the first of 15 books he eventually wrote or to which he made significant contributions. The company was run by aviation enthusiast [[George P. Putnam]].&lt;ref&gt;Herrmann, Anne [http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?cc=mqr;c=mqr;c=mqrarchive;idno=act2080.0039.110;rgn=main;view=text;xc=1;g=mqrg "On Amelia Earhart: The Aviatrix as American Dandy"] Ann Arnbor, MI:''The Michigan Quarterly Review'' Volume XXXIX, Issue 1, Winter 2000&lt;/ref&gt;
The dustjacket notes said that Lindbergh wanted to share the "story of his life and his transatlantic flight together with his views on the future of aviation", and that ''"WE"'' referred to the "spiritual partnership" that had developed "between himself and his airplane during the dark hours of his flight".&lt;ref&gt;Wohl, Robert. ''The Spectacle of Flight: Aviation and the Western Imagination, 1920–1950''.

Putnam's Sons (The Knickerbocker Press), July 1927. Dustjacket notes, First Edition, July 1927&lt;/ref&gt; But Putnam's had selected the title without Lindbergh's knowledge, and he complained, "we" actually referred to himself and his St. Louis financial backers, though his frequent unconscious use of the phrase seemed to suggest otherwise.{{explain|date=January 2017}}&lt;ref name="Berg 1998 Chapt 7"&gt;Berg (1998) Chapt 7&lt;/ref&gt;

''"WE"'' was soon translated into most major languages and sold more than 650,000 copies in the first year, earning Lindbergh more than $250,000. Its success was considerably aided by Lindbergh's three-month, {{convert|22,350|mi|km|adj=on}} tour of the United States in the ''Spirit'' on behalf of the [[Daniel Guggenheim Fund for the Promotion of Aeronautics]]. Between {{nowrap|July 20}} and {{nowrap|October 23}}, 1927 Lindbergh visited 82 cities in all 48 states, delivered 147 speeches, rode {{convert|1290|mi|km|abbr=on}} in parades,&lt;ref name="Berg 1998 Chapt 7"/&gt;{{refn|Cities in which Lindbergh and the ''Spirit of St. Louis'' landed during the Guggenheim Tour included: New York, N.Y.; Hartford, Conn.; Providence, R.I.; Boston, Mass.; Concord, N.H.; Orchard Beach &amp; Portland, Me.; Springfield, Vt.; Albany, Schenectady, Syracuse, Rochester, &amp; Buffalo, N.Y.; Cleveland, Ohio; Pittsburgh, Pa.; Wheeling, W.V.; Dayton &amp; Cincinnati, Ohio; Louisville, Ky.; Indianapolis, Ind.; Detroit &amp; Grand Rapids, Mich.; Chicago &amp; Springfield, Ill.; St. Louis &amp; Kansas City, Mo.; Wichita, Kan.; St. Joseph, Mo.; Moline, Ill.; Milwaukee &amp; Madison, Wis.; Minneapolis/St. Paul &amp; Little Falls, Minn.; Fargo, N.D.; Sioux Falls, S.D.; Des Moines, Iowa; Omaha, Neb.; Denver, Colo.; Pierre, S.D.; Cheyenne, Wyo.; Salt Lake City, Utah; Boise, Idaho; Butte &amp; Helena, Mont.; Spokane &amp; Seattle, Wash.; Portland, Ore.; San Francisco, Oakland, &amp; Sacramento, Calif.; Reno, Nev.; Los Angeles &amp; San Diego, Calif.; Tucson, Ariz.; Lordsburg, N.M.; El Paso, Texas; Santa Fe, N.M.; Abilene, Fort Worth &amp; Dallas, Texas; Oklahoma City, Tulsa &amp; Muskogee, Okla.; Little Rock, Ark.; Memphis &amp; Chattanooga, Tenn.; Birmingham, Alabama; Jackson, Miss.; New Orleans, La.; Jacksonville, Fla.; Spartensburg, S.C.; Greensboro &amp; Winston-Salen, N.C.; Richmond, Va.; Washington, D.C.; Baltimore, Md.; Atlantic City, N.J.; Wilmington, Del.; Philadelphia, Pa.; New York, N.Y.|group=N}} was seen by more than 30 million Americans, one quarter of the nation's population.&lt;ref name="Berg 1998 Chapt 7"/&gt;

Lindbergh then toured 16 Latin America countries between {{nowrap|December 13}}, 1927 and {{nowrap|February 8}}, 1928.

Lindbergh and [[Pan American World Airways]] head [[Juan Trippe]] were interested in developing a [[great circle]] air route across Alaska and Siberia to China and Japan. In the summer of 1931, with Trippe's support, Lindbergh and his wife flew from Long Island to [[Nome, Alaska]] and from there to Siberia, Japan and China. The route was not available for commercial service until after World War{{nbsp}}II, as prewar aircraft lacked the range to fly Alaska to Japan nonstop, and the United States had not officially recognized the Soviet government.&lt;ref&gt;Kiffer, Dave.

[[File:CAL SoSL STD HAV.jpg|thumb|upright=1|right|B.L. Rowe corner cover flown in the ''Spirit of St. Louis'' from Santo Domingo to Port-au-Prince and Havana]]

Two weeks after his Latin American tour, Lindbergh piloted a series of special flights over his old CAM-2 route on {{nowrap|February 20}} and {{nowrap|February 21}}. Tens of thousands of self-addressed souvenir covers were sent in from all over the world, so at each stop Lindbergh switched to another of the three planes he and his fellow CAM-2 pilots had used, so it could be said that each cover had been flown by him. The covers were then backstamped and returned to their senders as promotion of the Air Mail Service.&lt;ref&gt;"Lindbergh Flies His Old Mail Route".

In 1929–1931, Lindbergh carried much smaller numbers of souvenir covers on the first flights over routes in [[Latin America]] and the [[Caribbean]], which he had earlier laid out as a consultant to [[Pan American World Airways|Pan American Airways]] to be then flown under contract to the Post Office as Foreign Air Mail (FAM) routes 5 and 6.&lt;ref&gt;"The American Air Mail Catalogue" Fifth Edition, Volume 3, pp. 1418–1455 ''The American Air Mail Society'' (1978)&lt;/ref&gt;

In his autobiography, Lindbergh derided pilots he met as womanizing "barnstormers;" he also criticized Army cadets for their "facile" approach to relationships. He wrote that the ideal romance was stable and long-term, with a woman with keen intellect, good health, and strong genes,&lt;ref&gt;Lindbergh 1977, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; his "experience in breeding animals on our farm [having taught him] the importance of good heredity".&lt;ref&gt;Lindbergh 1977, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anne Morrow Lindbergh]] (1906–2001) was the daughter of [[Dwight Morrow]] who, as partner at [[J.P. Morgan &amp; Co.]], had acted as financial adviser to Lindbergh. He was also the U.S. Ambassador to Mexico in 1927. Invited by Morrow on a goodwill tour to Mexico, Lindbergh met Anne in Mexico City in December 1927.{{sfn |Bryson |2013 |p=434}}

In 1930, Lindbergh's sister-in-law developed a fatal heart condition. Lindbergh began to wonder why hearts could not be repaired with surgery. Starting in early 1931 at the Rockefeller Institute and continuing during his time living in France, Lindbergh studied the [[perfusion]] of organs outside the body with [[Nobel Prize]]-winning French surgeon Dr. [[Alexis Carrel]]. Although perfused organs were said to have survived surprisingly well, all showed progressive [[Degenerative disease|degenerative]] changes within a few days.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ctsnet.org/edmunds/Chapter1section7.html "The Development of Cardiopulmonary Bypass"]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203130828/http://www.ctsnet.org/edmunds/Chapter1section7.html |date=February 3, 2007 }} ctsnet.org.

===Overseas visits===
At the request of the United States military, Lindbergh traveled to Germany several times between 1936 and 1938 to evaluate German aviation.&lt;ref name="Time Magazine, January 19, 1939"&gt;''Time'' magazine, January 19, 1939.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hanna Reitsch]] demonstrated the [[Focke-Wulf Fw 61]] helicopter to Lindbergh in 1937,&lt;ref name=Reitsch&gt;Reitsch, H., 1955, ''The Sky My Kingdom'', London: Biddles Limited, Guildford and King's Lynn, {{ISBN|1853672629}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|121}}
and he was the first American to examine Germany's newest bomber, the [[Junkers Ju 88]], and Germany's front-line [[fighter aircraft]], the [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]], which he was allowed to pilot. He said of the Bf 109 that he knew of "no other pursuit plane which combines simplicity of construction with such excellent performance characteristics".&lt;ref name="Time Magazine, January 19, 1939"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Herman, Arthur pp. 289-93"&gt;Herman, Arthur.

There is disagreement on how accurate Lindbergh's reports were, but Cole asserts that the consensus among British and American officials was that they were slightly exaggerated but badly needed.&lt;ref name="Cole 1974"/&gt;
Lindbergh also undertook a survey of aviation in the [[Soviet Union]] in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;Cole 1974, pp. 39–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hermann Goering gives Charles Lindbergh a Nazi medal.jpg|right|thumb|Göring presenting Lindbergh with a medal on behalf of [[Adolf Hitler]] in October 1938]]

In 1938, [[Hugh R. Wilson|Hugh Wilson]], the American ambassador to Germany, hosted a dinner for Lindbergh with Germany's air chief, [[Hermann Göring]] and three central figures in German aviation, [[Ernst Heinkel]], [[Adolf Baeumker]], and [[Willy Messerschmitt]].
At this dinner Göring presented Lindbergh with the Commander Cross of the [[Order of the German Eagle]]. Lindbergh's acceptance proved controversial after [[Kristallnacht]], an anti-Jewish pogrom in Germany a few weeks later. Lindbergh declined to return the medal, later writing: "It seems to me that the returning of decorations, which were given in times of peace and as a gesture of friendship, can have no constructive effect. If I were to return the German medal, it seems to me that it would be an unnecessary insult. Even if war develops between us, I can see no gain in indulging in a spitting contest before that war begins."&lt;ref&gt;Ross 2006, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-Interventionism and America First involvement===
At the urging of U.S. Ambassador [[Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr.|Joseph Kennedy]], Lindbergh wrote a secret memo to the British warning that a military response by Britain and France to Hitler's violation of the [[Munich Agreement]] would be disastrous; he claimed that France was militarily weak and Britain over-reliant on its navy. He urgently recommended that they strengthen their air power to force Hitler to redirect his aggression against "Asiatic [[Communism]]".&lt;ref name="Cole 1974"&gt;Cole 1974{{Page needed|date=March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In a controversial 1939 ''[[Reader's Digest]]'' article he wrote, "Our civilization depends on peace among Western nations&amp;nbsp;... and therefore on united strength, for Peace is a virgin who dare not show her face without Strength, her father, for protection."&lt;ref&gt;Lindbergh, Col.

{{anchor|America First}}
Following Hitler's invasion of Czechoslovakia and Poland, Lindbergh decried suggestions that the United States should send aid to countries under threat,{{Elucidate|date=January 2017|reason=to whom?}} writing "I do not believe that repealing the arms embargo would assist democracy in Europe" and&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;October 13, 1939 speech excerpted in CharlesLindbergh.com&lt;/ref&gt; "If we repeal the arms embargo with the idea of assisting one of the warring sides to overcome the other, then why mislead ourselves by talk of neutrality?"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; He equated assistance with war profiteering: "To those who argue that we could make a profit and build up our own industry by selling munitions abroad, I reply that we in America have not yet reached a point where we wish to capitalize on the destruction and death of war."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In late 1940 Lindbergh became spokesman of the non-interventionist [[America First Committee]],&lt;ref&gt;Mosley 1976, p. 257.&lt;/ref&gt; soon speaking to overflow crowds at [[Madison Square Garden (1925)|Madison Square Garden]] and Chicago's [[Soldier Field]], with millions listening by radio. He argued that America had no business attacking Germany; in writings published posthumously he justified this stance:

{{quote|I was deeply concerned that the potentially gigantic power of America, guided by uninformed and impractical idealism, might crusade into Europe to destroy Hitler without realizing that Hitler's destruction would lay Europe open to the rape, loot and barbarism of [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|Soviet Russia]]'s forces, causing possibly the fatal wounding of western civilization.&lt;ref&gt;Lindbergh 1977, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Amrally.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Lindbergh speaking at an AFC rally]]

In his 1941 testimony before the [[United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs|House Committee on Foreign Affairs]] opposing the [[Lend-Lease|Lend-Lease bill]], Lindbergh proposed that the United States negotiate a neutrality pact with Germany.&lt;ref&gt;"Urges Neutrality: Aviator Testifies He Wants Neither Side to Win Conflict". ''The New York Times'', January 24, 1941, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Franklin Roosevelt]] publicly decried Lindbergh's views as those of a "defeatist and appeaser", comparing him to [[Clement Laird Vallandigham|U.S. Rep. Clement L. Vallandigham]], who had led the [[Copperheads (politics)|"Copperhead"]] movement that had opposed the [[American Civil War]]. Lindbergh promptly resigned his commission as a colonel in the U.S. Army Air Corps, writing that he saw "no honorable alternative" given that Roosevelt had publicly questioned his loyalty.&lt;ref&gt;"Lingbergh Quits Air Corps; Sees His Loyalty Questioned". ''The New York Times'', April 29, 1941, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

At an America First rally in September, Lindbergh accused three groups of "pressing this country toward war[:] the British, the Jewish, and the Roosevelt Administration":{{sfn |Bryson |2013 |p=439}}

{{quote|Instead of agitating for war, the Jewish groups in this country should be opposing it in every possible way for they will be among the first to feel its consequences.

He went on to warn of "large [Jewish] ownership and influence in our motion pictures, our press, our radio, and our government", though he condemned Germany's [[antisemitism]]: "No person with a sense of the dignity of mankind can condone the persecution of the Jewish race in Germany." He continued,

{{quote|I am not attacking either the Jewish or the British people. Both races, I admire. But I am saying that the leaders of both the British and the Jewish races, for reasons which are as understandable from their viewpoint as they are inadvisable from ours, for reasons which are not American, wish to involve us in the war.

Anne Lindbergh felt that the speech might tarnish Lindbergh's reputation unjustly; she wrote in her diary:
{{quote|I have the greatest faith in [Lindbergh] as a person{{mdashb}}in his integrity, his courage, and his essential ''goodness'', fairness, and kindness{{mdashb}}his nobility really&amp;nbsp;... How then explain my profound feeling of grief about what he is doing? If what he said is the truth (and I am inclined to think it is), why was it wrong to state it?

[[Interventionism (politics)|Interventionists]] created pamphlets pointing out his efforts were praised in [[Nazi Germany]] and included quotations such as "Racial strength is vital; politics, a luxury". They included pictures of him and other America Firsters using the stiff-armed [[Bellamy salute]] (a hand gesture described by [[Francis Bellamy]] to accompany his [[Pledge of Allegiance]] to the [[American flag]]); the photos were taken from an angle not showing the flag, so to observers it was indistinguishable from the [[Hitler salute]].&lt;ref&gt;Birkhead, L.M.

===Attitudes toward race and racism===
Lindbergh elucidated his beliefs regarding [[White people|white race]] in a 1939 article in ''Reader's Digest'':

Lindbergh's speeches and writings reflected his adoption of views on race and religion similar to that of the Nazis.&lt;ref&gt;The Wartime Journals of Charles Lindbergh&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of his trips to Nazi Germany that were combined with a belief in [[eugenics]],&lt;ref&gt;Wallace 2005, pp. 83–85.&lt;/ref&gt; Lindbergh was suspected of being a Nazi sympathizer.

Lindbergh's reaction to Kristallnacht was entrusted to his diary: "I do not understand these riots on the part of the Germans," he wrote. "It seems so contrary to their sense of order and intelligence. They have undoubtedly had a difficult '[[Jewish question|Jewish problem]]', but why is it necessary to handle it so unreasonably?"&lt;ref&gt;Wallace 2005, p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt; Lindbergh had planned to move to Berlin for the winter of 1938–39. He had provisionally found a house in [[Wannsee]], but after Nazi friends discouraged him from leasing it because it had been formerly owned by Jews,&lt;ref name="Wallace p. 175"&gt;Wallace 2005, p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; it was recommended that he contact [[Albert Speer]], who said he would build the Lindberghs a house anywhere they wanted.

In his diaries, he wrote: "We must limit to a reasonable amount the Jewish influence&amp;nbsp;... Whenever the Jewish percentage of total population becomes too high, a reaction seems to invariably occur. It is too bad because a few Jews of the right type are, I believe, an asset to any country."

;Nazi classification and racial definition

Lindbergh's anticommunism resonated deeply with many Americans, while eugenics and [[Nordic race|Nordicism]] enjoyed social acceptance.&lt;ref name="Rosen"/&gt;

Lindbergh developed a long-term friendship with the automobile pioneer [[Henry Ford]], who was well known for his anti-Semitic newspaper ''[[The Dearborn Independent]]''. In a famous comment about Lindbergh to [[Detroit]]'s former FBI field office special agent in charge in July 1940, Ford said: "When Charles comes out here, we only talk about the Jews."&lt;ref&gt;Collier and Horowitz 1987, pp. 205 and note, p. 457.

Lindbergh considered Russia a "semi-Asiatic" country compared to Germany, and he believed Communism was an ideology that would destroy the West's "racial strength" and replace everyone of European descent with "a pressing sea of Yellow, Black, and Brown". He stated that if he had to choose, he would rather see America allied with Nazi Germany than Soviet Russia. He preferred [[Nordic race|Nordics]], but he believed, after Soviet Communism was defeated, Russia would be a valuable ally against potential aggression from [[East Asia]].&lt;ref name="Eagle to Earth"/&gt;&lt;ref name="preface"&gt;MacDonald, Kevin.

Lindbergh said certain races have "demonstrated superior ability in the design, manufacture, and operation of machines".&lt;ref&gt;Cole 1974, pp. 81–82.&lt;/ref&gt; He further said, "The growth of our western civilization has been closely related to this superiority."&lt;ref&gt;Cole 1974, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; Lindbergh admired "the German genius for science and organization, the English genius for government and commerce, the French genius for living and the understanding of life". He believed, "in America they can be blended to form the greatest genius of all."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Vital Speeches of the Day]]'', Volume 5, pp. 751–752.&lt;/ref&gt; His message was popular throughout many Northern communities and especially well received in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], while the [[Southern United States|American South]] was [[Anglophilia|anglophilic]] and supported a pro-British foreign policy.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, David.

In his book ''[[The American Axis: Henry Ford, Charles Lindbergh and the Rise of the Third Reich|The American Axis]]'', [[Holocaust]] researcher and investigative journalist [[Max Wallace]] agreed with Franklin Roosevelt's assessment that Lindbergh was "pro-Nazi". However, he found that the Roosevelt Administration's accusations of dual loyalty or treason were unsubstantiated. Wallace considered Lindbergh to be a well-intentioned but bigoted and misguided Nazi sympathizer whose career as the leader of the isolationist movement had a destructive impact on Jewish people.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace 2005, p. 358.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lindbergh's [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning biographer, [[A. Scott Berg]], contended that Lindbergh was not so much a supporter of the Nazi regime as someone so stubborn in his convictions and relatively inexperienced in political maneuvering that he easily allowed rivals to portray him as one. Lindbergh's receipt of the German medal was approved without objection by the American embassy; the war had not yet begun in Europe. The award did not cause controversy until the war began and Lindbergh returned to the United States in 1939 to spread his message of nonintervention. Berg contended Lindbergh's views were commonplace in the United States in the pre–World War II era. Lindbergh's support for the America First Committee was representative of the sentiments of a number of American people.&lt;ref&gt;Berg 1998{{Page needed|date=March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet Berg also noted, "As late as April 1939{{mdashb}}after Germany overtook Czechoslovakia{{mdashb}}Lindbergh was willing to make excuses for Hitler. 'Much as I disapprove of many things Hitler had done,' he wrote in his diary on {{nowrap|April 2}}, 1939, 'I believe she [Germany] has pursued the only consistent policy in Europe in recent years. I cannot support her broken promises, but she has only moved a little faster than other nations&amp;nbsp;... in breaking promises. The question of right and wrong is one thing by law and another thing by history.'" Berg also explained that leading up to the war, in Lindbergh's mind, the great battle would be between the Soviet Union and Germany, not fascism and democracy.

Wallace noted that it was difficult to find social scientists among Lindbergh's contemporaries in the 1930s who found validity in racial explanations for human behavior. Wallace went on to observe, "throughout his life, eugenics would remain one of Lindbergh's enduring passions."&lt;ref&gt;Wallace 2005, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lindbergh always preached military strength and alertness.&lt;ref&gt;Lindbergh, Charles A.

Retrieved: January 19, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Berg revealed that while the attack on Pearl Harbor came as a shock to Lindbergh, he did predict that America's "wavering policy in the [[Philippines]]" would invite a bloody war there, and, in one speech, he warned, "we should either fortify these islands adequately, or get out of them entirely."&lt;ref&gt;Berg 1998{{Page needed|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War II==
After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Lindbergh sought to be recommissioned in the USAAF. The Secretary of War, [[Henry L. Stimson]], declined the request on instructions from the White House.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/lindbergh2.htm "Charles Lindbergh in Combat, 1944"].

Unable to take on an active military role, Lindbergh approached a number of aviation companies and offered his services as a consultant. As a technical adviser with Ford in 1942, he was heavily involved in troubleshooting early problems encountered at the [[Willow Run]] [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator]] bomber production line. As B-24 production smoothed out, he joined [[United Aircraft]] in 1943 as an engineering consultant, devoting most of his time to its [[Chance-Vought|Chance-Vought Division]].&lt;ref&gt;Herman, Arthur. ''Freedom's Forge: How American Business Produced Victory in World War II'', pp. 232–6, Random House, New York, NY. {{ISBN|978-1-4000-6964-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, Lindbergh persuaded United Aircraft to designate him as a technical representative in the [[Pacific War|Pacific Theater]] to study aircraft performances under combat conditions. Among other things, he showed Marine pilots how to take off safely with a bomb load double the [[Vought F4U Corsair]] fighter-bomber's rated capacity. At the time, several Marine squadrons were flying bomber escorts to destroy the Japanese stronghold of [[Rabaul]], [[New Britain]], in the Australian [[Territory of New Guinea]]. On {{nowrap|May 21}}, 1944, Lindbergh flew his first combat mission: a strafing run with [[VMF-222]] near the Japanese garrison of Rabaul.&lt;ref name="mersky"/&gt; He also flew with [[VMF-216]], from the Marine Air Base at [[Torokina]], [[Bougainville Island|Bougainville]]. Lindbergh was escorted on one of these missions by Lt. Robert E. (Lefty) McDonough, who refused to fly with Lindbergh again, as he did not want to be known as "the guy who killed Lindbergh".&lt;ref name="mersky"/&gt;

[[File:433dfws.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.7|433rd Fighter Squadron "Satan's Angels"]]

In his six months in the Pacific in 1944, Lindbergh took part in fighter bomber raids on Japanese positions, flying 50 combat missions (again as a civilian).&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, Daniel (1989) "Fifty Missions: The Combat Career of Col.

Retrieved: January 19, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Lindbergh introduced [[Air–fuel ratio|engine-leaning techniques]] to P-38 pilots, greatly improving fuel consumption at cruise speeds, enabling the long-range fighter aircraft to fly longer range missions. The U.S. Marine and Army Air Force pilots who served with Lindbergh praised his courage and defended his patriotism.&lt;ref name="mersky"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herman, Arthur.

==Later life==
After World War II, Lindbergh lived in [[Darien, Connecticut|Darien]], [[Connecticut]] and served as a consultant to the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force]] and to [[Pan American World Airways]]. With most of eastern Europe under Communist control, Lindbergh believed that his prewar assessments of the Soviet threat were correct. Lindbergh witnessed firsthand the defeat of Germany and the Holocaust, and Berg reported, "he knew the American public no longer gave a hoot about his opinions." In 1954, on the recommendation of President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], Lindbergh was commissioned a [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] in the [[U.S. Air Force Reserve]]. Also in that year, he served on a Congressional advisory panel that recommended the site of the [[United States Air Force Academy]].{{Citation needed|date = May 2017}}

===Double life and secret European children===
Beginning in 1957, Lindbergh had engaged in lengthy sexual relationships with three women while he remained married to Anne Morrow. He fathered three children with hatmaker Brigitte Hesshaimer (1926–2001), who had lived in the small Bavarian town of [[Geretsried]]. He had two children with her sister Mariette, a painter living in [[Grimisuat]]. Lindbergh also had a son and daughter (born in 1959 and 1961) with Valeska, an East Prussian aristocrat who was his private secretary in Europe and lived in [[Baden-Baden]].&lt;ref&gt;Lindbergh, Reeve.

Ten days before he died, Lindbergh wrote to each of his European mistresses, imploring them to maintain the utmost secrecy about his illicit activities with them even after his death.&lt;ref&gt;Lindbergh letter to Brigitte Hesshaimer dated August 16, 1974 reproduced in ''Das Doppelleben des Charles A. Lindbergh''&lt;/ref&gt; The three women (none of whom ever married) all managed to keep their affairs secret even from their children, who during his lifetime (and for almost a decade after his death) did not know the true identity of their father, whom they had only known by the alias Careu Kent and they had only seen him when he briefly visited them once or twice per year. However, after reading a magazine article about Lindbergh in the mid-1980s, Brigitte's daughter Astrid deduced the truth; she later discovered snapshots and more than 150 love letters from Lindbergh to Brigitte. After Brigitte and Anne Lindbergh had both died, she made her findings public; in 2003 DNA tests confirmed that Lindbergh had fathered Astrid and her two siblings.&lt;ref name="Schröck"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"DNA Proves Lindbergh Led a Double Life" ''The New York Times'' November 29, 2003, p.

==Books==
In addition to ''"WE"'' and ''The Spirit of St. Louis'', Lindbergh wrote prolifically over the years on other topics, including science, technology, nationalism, war, materialism, and values. Included among those writings were five other books: ''The Culture of Organs'' (with [[Alexis Carrel|Dr. Alexis Carrel]]) (1938), ''Of Flight and Life'' (1948), ''The Wartime Journals of Charles A. Lindbergh'' (1970), ''Boyhood on the Upper Mississippi'' (1972), and his unfinished ''Autobiography of Values'' (posthumous, 1978).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goodreads.com/author/list/158062.Charles_A_Lindbergh "List of books by Charles Lindbergh"] Goodreads.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, Eric F.

In addition to many biographies such as A. Scott Berg's massive ''"Lindbergh"'' published in 1999 and others, Lindbergh also influenced or was the model for characters in a variety of works of fiction.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=917118 "List of books about Charles Lindbergh"] Amazon.com&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after he made his famous flight, the [[Stratemeyer Syndicate]] began publishing a series of books for juvenile readers called the ''[[Ted Scott Flying Stories]]'' (1927–1943), which were written by a number of authors all using the ''[[pen name|nom de plume]]'' of [[Franklin W. Dixon]], in which the pilot hero was closely modeled after Lindbergh. Ted Scott duplicated the solo flight to Paris in the series' first volume, entitled ''Over the Ocean to Paris'' published in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;Dixon, Franklin ''"Over the Ocean to Paris"'' New York:Grosset &amp; Dunlop (1927) First edition dusk jacket notes.&lt;/ref&gt; Another fictional literary reference to Lindbergh appears in the [[Agatha Christie]] book (1934) and movie ''[[Murder on the Orient Express (1974 film)|Murder on the Orient Express]]'' (1974) which begins with a fictionalized depiction of the [[Lindbergh baby kidnapping]].&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Amy [http://www.litencyc.com/php/sworks.php?rec=true&amp;UID=3395 "Agatha Christie: Murder on the Orient Express"] The Literary Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Denis MacEoin|Daniel Easterman]]'s [[K is for Killing]] (1997), a fictional Charles Lindbergh becomes President of a fascist United States. His vice-president, and power behind the throne, is the notorious rapist and Grand Dragon of the Ku Klux Klan, [[D. C. Stephenson|David Stephenson]]. Eventually, Lindbergh is assassinated in the novel and it is implied that Stephenson, who has now risen to President of the United States, orchestrated Lindbergh's murder.

The [[Philip Roth]] novel ''[[The Plot Against America]]'' (2004) explores an [[alternate history]] where [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] is defeated in the 1940 presidential election by Lindbergh, who allies the United States with [[Nazi Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;Berman, Paul [http://nyti.ms/1E4wSPs "The Plot Against America"] The New York ''Times'' October 3, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

* In the motion picture ''[[The Spirit of St. Louis (film)|The Spirit of St. Louis]]'', directed by [[Billy Wilder]] and released in 1957, Lindbergh was played by [[James Stewart]], an admirer of Lindbergh and himself an aviator who had flown bombing missions in World War{{nbsp}}II.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, Gene D.

===Music===

Within days of the flight, dozens of [[Tin Pan Alley]] publishers rushed a variety of popular songs into print celebrating Lindbergh and the ''Spirit of St. Louis'' including "[[Lindbergh (The Eagle of the U.S.A.)]]" by Howard Johnson and [[Al Sherman]], and "Lucky Lindy" by [[L. Wolfe Gilbert]] and Abel Baer. In the two-year period following Lindbergh's flight, the U.S. Copyright Office recorded three hundred applications for Lindbergh songs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charleslindbergh.com/music/ ''Charles Lindbergh Music Clips"] CharlesLindbergh.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Lucky Lindy" ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', June 4, 1928&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tony Randall]] revived "Lucky Lindy" in an album of [[Jazz Age]] and [[Great Depression|Depression]]-era songs that he recorded entitled ''Vo Vo De Oh Doe'' (1967).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.starpulse.com/Actors/Randall,_Tony/ "Tony Randall Biography"].

In 1929, [[Bertolt Brecht]] wrote a musical called ''Der Lindberghflug'' (The Lindbergh Flight) with music by [[Kurt Weill]] and [[Paul Hindemith]]. Because of Lindbergh's apparent Nazi sympathies, in 1950 Brecht removed all direct references to Lindbergh and renamed the piece ''[[The Flight across the Ocean|Der Ozeanflug]]'' (The Ocean Flight).&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, Steven [http://www.classical.net/music/recs/reviews/c/cap60012a.php ''Der Lindberghflug'' (The Lindbergh Flight)] Classical net review of Capriccio recording (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cartoons===
During World War II, Lindbergh was a frequent target of [[Dr Seuss]]'s first political cartoons, published in the New York magazine [[PM (newspaper)|PM]], in which Geisel emphasised Lindbergh's anti-semitism and Nazi sympathies.&lt;ref&gt;see https://library.ucsd.edu/dc/search?f%5Bcollection_sim%5D%5B%5D=Dr.+Seuss+Political+Cartoons&amp;id=bb65202085&lt;/ref&gt;
