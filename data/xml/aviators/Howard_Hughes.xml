'''Howard Robard Hughes Jr.''' (December 24, 1905 – April 5, 1976) was an American [[business magnate]], investor, record-setting pilot, engineer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Howard R. Hughes |url= https://www.unlv.edu/engineering/hughes |work = UNLV Howard R. Hughes College of Engineering | accessdate = July 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; film director, and [[Philanthropy|philanthropist]], known during his lifetime as one of the most financially successful individuals in the world. He first made a name for himself as a film producer, and then became an influential figure in the aviation industry. Later in life, he became known for his [[eccentric behavior]] and reclusive lifestyle—oddities that were caused in part by a worsening [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]] (OCD), [[chronic pain]] from several plane crashes, and increasing deafness.

As a maverick film tycoon, Hughes gained prominence in [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] beginning in the late 1920s, when he produced big-budget and often controversial films such as ''[[The Racket (1928 film)|The Racket]]'' (1928),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/85281%7C0/The-Racket.html|title=The Racket (1928)|website=Turner Classic Movies|access-date=August 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Hell's Angels (film)|Hell's Angels]]'' (1930),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/78352%7C0/Hell-s-Angels.html|title=Hell's Angels|website=Turner Classic Movies|access-date=August 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Scarface (1932 film)|Scarface]]'' (1932). Later he controlled the [[RKO Pictures|RKO]] film studio.

Hughes formed the [[Hughes Aircraft Company]] in 1932, hiring numerous engineers and designers. He spent the rest of the 1930s and much of the 1940s setting multiple [[Flight airspeed record|world air speed records]] and building the [[Hughes H-1 Racer]] and [[H-4 Hercules]] (the ''Spruce Goose''). He acquired and expanded [[Trans World Airlines]] and later acquired [[Hughes Airwest|Air West]], renaming it [[Hughes Airwest]]. Hughes was included in [[Flying (magazine)|''Flying'' Magazine]]'s list of the 51 Heroes of Aviation, ranked at {{Abbr|No.|Number}} 25.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flyingmag.com/photo-gallery/photos/51-heroes-aviation?pnid=41829 "51 Heroes of Aviation."] ''Flying'' Magazine.

==Early years==
[[File:Howard Hughes as child (4729132038).jpg|thumb|upright|Hughes in April 1912]]
The birthplace of Howard Hughes is recorded as either [[Humble, Texas|Humble]] or [[Houston|Houston, Texas]]. The date remains uncertain due to conflicting dates from various sources. He repeatedly claimed that his birthday was on Christmas Eve. A 1941 [[affidavit]] [[birth certificate]] of Hughes that was signed by his aunt Annette Gano Lummis and Estelle Boughton Sharp states that he was born on December 24, 1905, in [[Harris County, Texas]].{{#tag:ref|No time of birth is listed. Record nr. 234358, of December 29, 1941, filed January 5, 1942, Bureau of Vital Statistics of Texas Department of Health.|group=N}} However, his certificate of [[Infant baptism|baptism]] recorded on October 7, 1906, in the parish register of St. John's Episcopal Church in [[Keokuk, Iowa]], listed his birth as September 24, 1905 without any reference to the place of birth.{{#tag:ref|The handwriting of the baptismal record is a rather trembling one. The clerk was an aged person and there is a chance that, supposedly being hard of hearing, they misheard "December 24" as "September 24" instead. This is speculative.|group=N}}

Hughes was the son of Allene Stone Gano and [[Howard R. Hughes Sr.]], a successful inventor and businessman from [[Missouri]]. He was of [[English American|English]], [[Welsh American|Welsh]] and some French [[Huguenot]], ancestry,&lt;ref&gt;Barlett and Steele 2004, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; and was a descendant of [[John Gano]], the minister who baptized [[George Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;Barlett, Donald L. and Steele, James B. ''Howard Hughes: His Life and Madness'' Norton, 2011, page 29.&lt;/ref&gt; His father had patented the [[Well drilling|two-cone roller bit]], which allowed rotary [[Oil well#Drilling|drilling]] for petroleum in previously inaccessible places. The senior Hughes made the shrewd and lucrative decision to commercialize the invention by leasing the bits instead of selling them, obtained several early patents, and founded the [[Hughes Tool Company]] in 1909. Hughes' uncle was the famed novelist, screenwriter, and film director [[Rupert Hughes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.anb.org/articles/10/10-01809.html|title=American National Biography Online: Hughes, Howard|website=www.anb.org|access-date=August 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a young age, Hughes demonstrated interest in science and technology. In particular, he had great engineering aptitude and built Houston's first "wireless" radio [[transmitter]] at age 11.&lt;ref name=encarta&gt;[http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761553204/Howard_Hughes.html "Howard Hughes."] ''MSN Encarta online,'' October 21, 2009. Retrieved: January 5, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to be one of the first licensed [[ham radio]] operators in Houston, having the assigned callsign W5CY (originally 5CY).&lt;ref&gt;http://users.tellurian.com/gjurrens/famous_hams.html {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140519025753/http://users.tellurian.com/gjurrens/famous_hams.html |date=May 19, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At 12, Hughes was photographed in the local newspaper, identified as being the first boy in Houston to have a "[[Motorcycle|motorized]]" bicycle, which he had built from parts from his father's [[steam engine]].&lt;ref name="cof.net"&gt;[http://www.century-of-flight.net/Aviation%20history/pathfinders/Howard%20Hughes.htm "Howard Hughes."] ''U.S. Centennial of Flight Commission,'' 2003. Retrieved: January 5, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; He was an indifferent student, with a liking for mathematics, flying, and mechanics. He took his first flying lesson at 14, and attended [[Fessenden School]] in Massachusetts in 1921.

He later attended math and aeronautical engineering courses at [[Caltech]].&lt;ref name=encarta/&gt;&lt;ref name="cof.net"/&gt; The red brick house where Hughes lived as a teenager at 3921 Yoakum St., Houston today serves as the headquarters of the Theology Department of the [[University of St. Thomas (Texas)|University of St. Thomas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Mail Goes Through But Flavor Is Gone|date=March 8, 1972|last=Beeney|first=Bill|work=The Democrat Chronicle|location=Rochester, New York|page=31|quote=Our facility residence is in the 4000 block on Yoakum Blvd. The building next to it at 3900 is the Modern Language Department, It is the former Howard Hughes home.

His mother Allene died in March 1922 from complications of an [[ectopic pregnancy]]. Howard Hughes Sr. died of a heart attack in 1924. Their deaths apparently inspired Hughes to include the creation of a [[Howard Hughes Medical Institute|medical research laboratory]] in the will that he signed in 1925 at age 19. Howard Sr.'s will had not been updated since Allene's death, and Hughes inherited 75% of the family fortune.&lt;ref&gt;[http://history1900s.about.com/od/peoplewhomadeanimpact/p/howardhughes.htm "Howard Hughes."] ''about.com''. Retrieved: January 5, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; On his 19th birthday, Hughes was declared an [[Emancipation of minors|emancipated minor]], enabling him to take full control of his life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.golfonline.com/golfonline/features/features/article/0,17742,1013633-2,00.html "Golf's Bizarre Billionaire."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014014020/http://www.golfonline.com/golfonline/features/features/article/0,17742,1013633-2,00.html |date=October 14, 2007 }} ''golfonline.com''.

From a young age, Hughes was an excellent and enthusiastic golfer. He often scored near par figures, played the game to a three handicap during his twenties, and for a time aimed for a professional golf career. He played frequently with top players, including [[Gene Sarazen]]. Hughes rarely played competitively and gradually gave up his passion for the sport to pursue other interests.&lt;ref&gt;Barkow 1986, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hughes withdrew from [[Rice University]] shortly after his father's death. On June 1, 1925, he married Ella Botts Rice, daughter of David Rice and Martha Lawson Botts of Houston. They moved to Los Angeles, where he hoped to make a name for himself as a filmmaker.

==Business career==
{{Main|Summa Corporation}}
Hughes enjoyed a highly successful business career beyond engineering, aviation, and filmmaking, though many of his career endeavors involved varying entrepreneurial roles. The Summa Corporation was the name adopted for the business interests of Howard Hughes after he sold the tool division of [[Hughes Tool Company]] in 1972. The company serves as the principal holding company for Hughes' business ventures and investments. It is primarily involved in aerospace and defense, electronics, mass media, manufacturing, and hospitality industries, but has maintained a strong presence in a wide variety of industries including real estate, petroleum drilling and oilfield services, consulting, entertainment, and engineering. Much of his fortune was later used for philanthropic causes, notably towards health care and medical research.

===Entertainment===
Hughes entered the entertainment industry after dropping out of Rice University and moving to Los Angeles. His first two films, ''Everybody's Acting'' (1927) and ''[[Two Arabian Knights]]'' (1928), were financial successes, the latter winning the first [[Academy Award for Best Director]] of a comedy picture. ''[[The Racket (1928 film)|The Racket]]'' (1928) and ''[[The Front Page (1931 film)|The Front Page]]'' (1931) were also nominated for [[Academy Awards]].

Hughes spent $3.8&amp;nbsp;million to make the flying film ''[[Hell's Angels (film)|Hell's Angels]]'' (1930). It earned nearly $8 million, about double the production and advertising costs.{{Clarify|reason=as figures differ from Wikipedia's discreet "Hell's Angels" entry.|date=February 2018}} ''Hell's Angels'' received one [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]]. He produced another hit, ''[[Scarface (1932 film)|Scarface]]'' (1932), a production delayed by censors' concern over its violence.

''[[The Outlaw]]'' (1943) was completed in 1941 and featured [[Jane Russell]]. It also received considerable attention from industry censors, this time owing to Russell's revealing costumes. Hughes designed a special [[bra]] for his leading lady, although Russell said it was uncomfortable and decided against wearing it.

====RKO====
{{Main|RKO Pictures}}

[[File:Howard-Hughes-TIME-1948.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Hughes on the cover of [[TIME Magazine]], July 1948 (with [[Spruce Goose]] on the background)]]

During the 1940s to the late 1950s, the Hughes Tool Company ventured into the film industry when it obtained partial ownership of the RKO companies which included RKO Pictures, RKO Studios, a chain of movie theaters known as RKO Theatres and a network of radio stations known as the RKO Radio Network.

In 1948, Hughes gained control of [[RKO]], a struggling major Hollywood studio, by acquiring 25% of the outstanding stock from [[Floyd Odlum]]'s [[Atlas Corporation]]. Within weeks of acquiring the studio, Hughes dismissed three-quarters of the work force and production was shut down for six months during which time investigations were conducted of each employee who remained with RKO as far as their political leanings were concerned. Only after ensuring that the stars under contract to RKO had no suspect affiliations would Hughes approve completed pictures to be sent back for re-shooting. This was especially true of the women who were under contract to RKO at that time. If Hughes felt that his stars did not properly represent the political views of his liking or if a film's [[anti-communism|anti-communist]] politics were not sufficiently clear, he pulled the plug. In 1952, an abortive sale to a Chicago-based group connected to the mafia with no experience in the industry also disrupted studio operations at RKO even further.

In 1953, Hughes was involved with a high profile lawsuit as part of the settlement of the ''[[United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.]]'' [[Antitrust]] Case. As a result of the hearings, the shaky status of RKO became increasingly apparent. A steady stream of lawsuits from RKO's minority shareholders had grown to be extremely annoying to Hughes. They had accused him of financial misconduct and corporate mismanagement. Since Hughes wanted to focus primarily on his aircraft manufacturing and TWA holdings during the [[Korean War]] years, Hughes offered to buy out all other stockholders in order to dispense with their distractions.

By the end of 1954 Hughes had gained near-total control of RKO at a cost of nearly $24&amp;nbsp;million, becoming the closest thing to a sole owner of a Hollywood studio seen in three decades. Six months later, Hughes sold the studio to the [[General Tire and Rubber Company]] for $25&amp;nbsp;million. Hughes retained the rights to pictures that he had personally produced, including those made at RKO. He also retained Jane Russell's contract. For Howard Hughes, this was the virtual end of his 25-year involvement in the motion picture industry. However, his reputation as a financial wizard emerged unscathed. During that time period, RKO became known as the home of film noir classic productions thanks in part to the limited budgets required to make such films during Hughes' tenure. Hughes reportedly walked away from RKO having made $6.5&amp;nbsp;million in personal profit.&lt;ref&gt;Lasky 1989, p. 229.&lt;/ref&gt;

General Tire was interested mainly in exploiting the value of the RKO library for television programming even though it made some attempts to continue producing films. After a year and a half of mixed success, General Tire shut down film production entirely at RKO at the end of January 1957. The studio lots in Hollywood and [[Culver City]] were sold to [[Desilu Productions]] later that year for $6.15&amp;nbsp;million.

===Real estate===
{{main|Howard Hughes Corporation}}

Beyond extending his business prowess in the manufacturing, aviation, entertainment, and hospitality industries, Hughes was a successful [[real estate]] investor. Hughes was deeply involved in the American real estate industry where he amassed vast holdings of undeveloped land both in [[Las Vegas]] and in the desert surrounding the city that had gone unused during his lifetime. In 1968, the [[Hughes Tool Company]] purchased the North Las Vegas Air Terminal.

Originally known as Summa Corporation, The Howard Hughes Corporation was formed in 1972 when the oil tools business of Hughes Tool Company, then owned by Howard Hughes Jr., was floated on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] under the Hughes Tool name. This forced the remaining businesses of the "original" Hughes Tool to adopt a new corporate name Summa. The name "Summa"{{emdash}}Latin for "highest"{{emdash}}was adopted without the approval of Hughes himself, who preferred to keep his own name on the business, and suggested HRH Properties (for Hughes Resorts and Hotels, and also his own initials). In 1988, Summa announced plans for [[Summerlin, Nevada|Summerlin]], a master-planned community named for the paternal grandmother of Howard Hughes, Jean Amelia Summerlin.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Initially staying in the [[Desert Inn]], Hughes refused to vacate his room, and instead decided to purchase the entire hotel. Hughes extended his financial empire to include Las Vegas real estate, hotels, and media outlets, spending an estimated $300 million, and using his considerable powers to take-over many of the well known hotels, especially the [[Organized crime in the United States|organized crime]] connected venues. He quickly became one of the most powerful men in Las Vegas. He was instrumental in changing the image of Las Vegas from its [[Wild West]] roots into a more refined cosmopolitan city.

===Aviation and aerospace===
[[File:Howard Hughes.jpg|thumb|Hughes with his [[Boeing 100]] in the 1940s]]

Another portion of Hughes' business interests lay in aviation, airlines, and the aerospace and defense industries. Hughes was a lifelong aircraft enthusiast and pilot. He survived four airplane accidents: one while filming ''Hell's Angels'', one while setting the air speed record in the Hughes Racer, one at Lake Mead in 1943, and the near fatal crash of the Hughes XF-11 in 1946. At Rogers Airport in Los Angeles, he learned to fly from pioneer aviators, including [[Moye Stephens]]. He set many world records and commissioned the construction of custom aircraft for himself while heading [[Hughes Aircraft]] at the [[Grand Central Airport (United States)|airport in Glendale]], CA. Operating from there, the most technologically important aircraft he commissioned was the [[Hughes H-1 Racer]]. On September 13, 1935, Hughes, flying the H-1, set the landplane [[Flight airspeed record|airspeed record]] of {{convert|352|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} over his test course near [[Santa Ana, California]] ([[Giuseppe Motta (aviator)|Giuseppe Motta]] reached 362&amp;nbsp;mph in 1929 and [[George Stainforth]] reached 407.5&amp;nbsp;mph in 1931, both in seaplanes). This was the last time in history that the world airspeed record was set in an aircraft built by a private individual. A year and a half later, on January 19, 1937, flying the same H-1 Racer fitted with longer wings, Hughes set a new [[transcontinental airspeed record]] by flying non-stop from Los Angeles to Newark in 7 hours, 28 minutes, and 25 seconds (beating his own previous record of 9 hours, 27 minutes). His average ground speed over the flight was {{convert|322|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Onkst, David H. [http://www.centennialofflight.net/essay/Explorers_Record_Setters_and_Daredevils/Hughes/EX28.htm "Howard R. Hughes Jr. – The Record Setter."] ''U.S. Centennial of Flight Commission'', 2003.

The H-1 Racer featured a number of design innovations: it had retractable landing gear (as [[Boeing Monomail]] had five years before) and all rivets and joints set flush into the body of the aircraft to reduce drag. The H-1 Racer is thought to have influenced the design of a number of [[World War II]] fighters such as the [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero]], [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190]], and [[F8F Bearcat]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wrightools.com/hughes/h1_history.htm "Aviator Howard Hughes H-1 Racer History."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050830082007/http://www.wrightools.com/hughes/h1_history.htm |date=August 30, 2005 }} ''wrightools.com''.

====Round-the-world flight====
On July 14, 1938, Hughes set another record by completing a flight around the world in just 91 hours (3 days, 19 hours, 17 minutes), beating the previous record set in 1933 by [[Wiley Post]] in a single engine [[Lockheed Vega]] by almost four days. Hughes returned home ahead of photographs of his flight. Taking off from [[New York City]], Hughes continued to [[Paris]], [[Moscow]], [[Omsk]], [[Yakutsk]], [[Fairbanks, Alaska|Fairbanks]], [[Minneapolis]], then returning to New York City. For this flight he flew a [[Lockheed Model 14 Super Electra|Lockheed 14 Super Electra]] (NX18973, a twin-engine transport with a four-man crew) fitted with the latest radio and navigational equipment. Hughes wanted the flight to be a triumph of American aviation technology, illustrating that safe, long-distance air travel was possible. Albert Lodwick of [[Mystic, Iowa]] provided organizational skills as the [[Flight operations quality assurance|flight operations]] manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Around the World in 91 Hours | url = http://www.historicalmarkerproject.com/markers/HM1P4Z_around-the-world-in-91-hours_Centerville-IA.html | work = Historical Marker Project website | accessdate = July 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While he had previously been relatively obscure despite his wealth, being better known for dating [[Katharine Hepburn]], New York City now gave Hughes a [[ticker-tape parade]] in the [[Canyon of Heroes]].&lt;ref name="life19380725"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=n08EAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;ots=Q9tkmm_XWR&amp;pg=PA9#v=onepage&amp;f=true "A Rich Young Texan with a Poet's Face Gets Hero's Welcome on World Flight."] ''Life '', July 25, 1938, pp. 9–11, 14.

He received many awards as an aviator, including the [[Harmon Trophy]] in 1936 and 1938, the [[Collier Trophy]] and the Bibesco Cup of the [[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale]] in 1938, the [[Octave Chanute Award]] in 1940, and a special [[Congressional Gold Medal]] in 1939 "in recognition of the achievements of Howard Hughes in advancing the science of aviation and thus bringing great credit to his country throughout the world". According to his [[obituary]] in the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'', Hughes never bothered to come to Washington to pick up the [[Congressional Gold Medal]], which was eventually mailed to him.

====Hughes D-2 and XF-11====
{{Main|Hughes D-2}}
The [[Hughes D-2]] was conceived in 1939 as a bomber with five crew members, powered by 42-cylinder [[Wright R-2160]] Tornado engines. In the end it appeared as two-seat fighter-reconnaissance aircraft designated the D-2A, powered by two [[Pratt &amp; Whitney R-2800]]-49 engines. The aircraft was constructed using the [[Duramold|Duramold process]]. The prototype was brought to Harper's Dry Lake California in great secrecy in 1943 and first flew on June 20 of that year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aerofiles.com/_h.html "Aircraft Ha to Hy."] ''Aerofiles''. Retrieved: July 31, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Acting on a recommendation of the president's son, Colonel [[Elliott Roosevelt]], who had become friends with Hughes, in September 1943 the USAAF ordered 100 of a reconnaissance development of the D-2, known as the F-11. Hughes then attempted to get the military to pay for the development of the D-2. In November 1944, the hangar containing the D-2A was reportedly hit by lightning and the aircraft was destroyed. The D-2 design was abandoned, but led to the extremely controversial [[Hughes XF-11]]. The XF-11 was a large all-metal, two-seat reconnaissance aircraft, powered by two [[Pratt &amp; Whitney R-4360]]-31 engines, each driving a set of [[contra-rotating propellers]]. Only the two prototypes were completed; the second one with a single propeller per side.&lt;ref&gt;Parker 2013, pp. 49–51&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 17, 1943, Hughes flew the Sikorsky from California carrying two CAA aviation inspectors, two of his employees, and actress [[Ava Gardner]]. Hughes dropped Gardner off in Las Vegas and proceeded to Lake Mead to conduct qualifying tests in the S-43. The test flight did not go well. The Sikorsky crashed into Lake Mead, killing CAA inspector Ceco Cline and Hughes employee Richard Felt. Hughes suffered a severe gash on the top of his head when he hit the upper control panel and had to be rescued by one of the others on board.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aviatorhowardhughes.com/hughes-lasvegas.htm "Hughes: Las Vegas."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328094805/http://www.aviatorhowardhughes.com/hughes-lasvegas.htm |date=March 28, 2012 }} ''aviatorhowardhughes.com''.

[[File:1946-07-11 Hughes Plane Crash.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=3|1946 newsreel]]

Hughes was involved in another near-fatal aircraft accident on July 7, 1946, while performing the first flight of the prototype [[U.S. Army Air Forces]] [[reconnaissance aircraft]], the [[Hughes XF-11|XF-11]], near Hughes airfield at [[Culver City, California]]. An oil leak caused one of the [[contra-rotating propellers]] to reverse pitch, causing the aircraft to [[Yaw angle|yaw]] sharply and lose altitude rapidly. Hughes attempted to save the aircraft by landing it at the [[Los Angeles Country Club]] golf course, but just seconds before reaching the course, the XF-11 started to drop dramatically and crashed in the [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]] neighborhood surrounding the country club.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.check-six.com/Crash_Sites/XF-11_crash_site.htm "Crash of the XF-11."] ''check-six.com''.

When the XF-11 finally came to a halt after destroying three houses, the fuel tanks exploded, setting fire to the aircraft and a nearby home at 808 North Whittier Drive, owned by Lt Col. Charles E. Meyer.&lt;ref&gt;Barlett and Steele 2004, p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; Hughes managed to pull himself out of the flaming wreckage but lay beside the aircraft until he was rescued by [[USMC|Marine]] [[Master sergeant#United States|Master Sgt.]] William L.

Despite his physical injuries, Hughes was proud that his mind was still working. As he lay in his hospital bed, he decided that he did not like the bed's design. He called in plant engineers to design a customized bed, equipped with hot and cold running water, built in six sections, and operated by 30 electric motors, with push-button adjustments.&lt;ref&gt;"Hughes Designs Hospital Bed." ''Associated Press'' wire article, August 14, 1946.&lt;/ref&gt; The hospital bed was designed by Hughes specifically to alleviate the pain caused by moving with severe burn injuries. Although he never used the bed that he designed, Hughes' bed served as a prototype for the modern [[hospital bed]].&lt;ref name="Barlett and Steele p. 143"&gt;Barlett and Steele 2004, p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; Hughes' doctors considered his recovery almost miraculous. Hughes, however, believed that neither miracle nor modern medicine contributed to his recovery, instead asserting the natural life-giving properties of fresh-squeezed [[orange juice]] were responsible.&lt;ref name="Barlett and Steele p. 143"/&gt;

====H-4 Hercules====
{{Main|Hughes H-4 Hercules}}
[[File:H-4 Hercules 2.jpg|thumb|The [[Hughes H-4 Hercules]] with Hughes at the controls]]
The [[War Production Board]] (not the military) originally contracted with [[Henry J. Kaiser|Henry Kaiser]] and Hughes to produce the gigantic HK-1 Hercules flying boat for use during [[World War II]] to transport troops and equipment across the Atlantic as an alternative to seagoing troop transport ships that were vulnerable to German [[U-boat]]s. The project was opposed by the military services, thinking it would siphon resources from higher priority programs, but was advocated by Hughes' powerful allies in Washington, D.C. After disputes, Kaiser withdrew from the project and Hughes elected to continue it as the H-4 Hercules. However, the aircraft was not completed until after the end of World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Parker 2013,'' pp. 49–58.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herman 2012, pp. 277–280.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hercules was the world's largest flying boat, the largest aircraft made from wood,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/design/q0188.shtml "Largest Plane in the World."] ''Aerospaceweb.org'' . Retrieved: March 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and, at {{convert|319|ft|11|in|m}}, had the longest [[wingspan]] of any aircraft (the next largest wingspan was about {{convert|310|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}). (The Hercules is no longer the longest or heaviest aircraft ever built; both of those titles are currently held by the [[Antonov An-225 Mriya|Antonov An-225 ''Mriya'']].)

The Hercules flew only once for one mile (1.6&amp;nbsp;km), and {{convert|70|ft|m}} above the water, with Hughes at the controls, on November 2, 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Parker, Dana T. ''Building Victory: Aircraft Manufacturing in the Los Angeles Area in World War II,'' pp. 58, Cypress, CA, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hercules was nicknamed the ''Spruce Goose'' by its critics, but it was actually made largely from [[birch]], not [[spruce]], rather than of aluminum, because the contract required that Hughes build the aircraft of "non-[[strategic material]]s". It was built in Hughes' [[Westchester, California]], facility. In 1947, Howard Hughes was summoned to testify before the [[Senate War Investigating Committee]] to explain why the H-4 development had been so troubled, and why $22 million had produced only two prototypes of the F-11. General Elliott Roosevelt and numerous other USAAF officers were also called to testify in hearings that transfixed the nation during August and November 1947. In hotly disputed testimony over [[Trans World Airlines|TWA]]'s route awards and malfeasance in the defense acquisition process, Hughes turned the tables on his main interlocutor, Maine Senator [[Owen Brewster]], and the hearings were widely interpreted as a Hughes victory. After being displayed at the harbor of Long Beach, California, the Hercules was moved to [[McMinnville, Oregon]], where it is now part of the [[Evergreen Aviation &amp; Space Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.evergreenmuseum.org/the-museum/aircraft-exhibits/the-spruce-goose/ "Spruce Goose."] ''Evergreen Aviation and Space Museum''.

====Hughes Aircraft====
{{Main|Hughes Aircraft}}
[[File:HughesAircraftCo.png|right|thumb|Hughes Aircraft Company logo until 1985]]
Hughes Aircraft Company, a division of Hughes Tool Company, was founded by Hughes in 1932, in a rented corner of a Lockheed Aircraft Corporation hangar in Burbank, California, to build the H-1 racer. During and after World War II, Hughes fashioned his company into a major defense contractor. The [[Hughes Helicopters]] division started in 1947 when [[helicopter]] manufacturer [[Kellett Autogiro Corporation|Kellett]] sold their latest design to Hughes for production. The company was a major American aerospace and defense contractor manufacturing numerous technology related products that include spacecraft vehicles, military aircraft, radar systems, electro-optical systems, the first working laser, aircraft computer systems, missile systems, ion-propulsion engines (for space travel), commercial satellites, and other electronics systems.

In 1948, Hughes created a new division of the company: the [[Hughes Aerospace#Hughes Aerospace Group|Hughes Aerospace]] Group. The Hughes Space and Communications Group and the Hughes Space Systems Division were later spun off in 1948 to form their own divisions and ultimately became the [[Hughes Space and Communications Company#Hughes Space and Communications|Hughes Space and Communications Company]] in 1961. In 1953, Howard Hughes gave all his stock in the Hughes Aircraft Company to the newly formed Howard Hughes Medical Institute, thereby turning the aerospace and defense contractor into a tax-exempt charitable organization. The Howard Hughes Medical Institute sold Hughes Aircraft in 1985 to General Motors for $5.2 billion. In 1997, General Motors sold Hughes Aircraft to [[Raytheon]] and in 2000, sold Hughes Space &amp; Communications to Boeing. A combination of Boeing, GM, and [[Raytheon]] acquired the [[Hughes Research Laboratories]], where it focused on advanced developments in microelectronics, information &amp; systems sciences, materials, sensors, and photonics; their workspace spans from basic research to product delivery. It has particularly emphasized capabilities in high performance integrated circuits, high power lasers, antennas, networking, and smart materials.

====Airlines====
In 1939, at the urging of [[Jack Frye]], president of [[Trans World Airlines]] ([[TWA]]), Hughes began to quietly purchase a majority share of TWA stock, and took a controlling interest in the airline by 1944.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Bartlett and Steele 2011, p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt; Although he never had an official position with TWA, Hughes handpicked the board of directors, and often issued orders directly to airline staff.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.stlmag.com/TWA-Death-Of-A-Legend/|title=TWA – Death Of A Legend|last=Grant|first=Elaine X.|date=July 28, 2006|work=St. Louis Magazine|access-date=January 10, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Lockheed L-1049G Super Constellation, Trans World Airlines (TWA) JP7078570.jpg|thumb|Lockheed Constellation in TWA livery]]
Hughes is commonly credited as the driving force behind the [[Lockheed Constellation]] airliner, which Hughes and Frye ordered in 1939 as a long-range replacement for TWA's fleet of [[Boeing 307|Boeing 307 Stratoliner]]s, Hughes personally financed TWA's acquisition of 40 Constellations for $18 million, the largest aircraft order in history up to that time. The Constellations were among the highest-performing commercial aircraft of the late 1940s and 1950s, and allowed TWA to pioneer nonstop transcontinental service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://airwaysmag.com/best-of-airways/howard-hughes-twas-constellations/|title=Howard Hughes and TWA´S Constellations – Airways Magazine|date=June 6, 2016|work=Airways Magazine|access-date=January 10, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; During World War II, Hughes leveraged political connections in Washington to obtain rights for TWA to serve Europe, making it the only U.S. carrier with a combination of domestic and transatlantic routes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

After the [[Boeing 707]] was announced, Hughes opted to pursue a more unique jet aircraft for TWA and approached [[Convair]] in late 1954. Convair proposed two concepts to Hughes, but Hughes was unable to decide which concept to adopt, and Convair eventually abandoned its initial jet project after the mockups of the 707 and [[Douglas DC-8]] were unveiled.&lt;ref&gt;Barlett and Steele 2011, pp. 218–219.&lt;/ref&gt; Even after competitors such as [[United Airlines]], [[American Airlines]] and [[Pan American World Airways]] had placed large orders for the 707, Hughes only placed eight orders for 707s through the Hughes Tool Company and forbade TWA from using the aircraft.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; After finally beginning to reserve 707 orders in 1956, Hughes embarked on a plan to build his own "superior" jet aircraft for TWA, applied for [[Civil Aeronautics Board|CAB]] permission to sell Hughes aircraft to TWA, and began negotiations with the state of Florida to build a manufacturing plant there. However, he abandoned this plan around 1958, and in the interim, negotiated new contracts for 707 and [[Convair 880]] aircraft and engines totaling $400 million.&lt;ref&gt;Barlett and Steele 2011, pp. 219–222.&lt;/ref&gt;

The financing of TWA's jet orders precipitated the end of Hughes' relationship with [[Noah Dietrich]], and ultimately Hughes's ouster from control of TWA. Hughes did not have enough cash on hand or future cash flow to pay for the orders, and did not immediately seek bank financing. Hughes's refusal to heed Dietrich's financing advice led to a major rift between the two by the end of 1956. Hughes believed that Dietrich wished to have Hughes committed as mentally incompetent, although the evidence of this is inconclusive. Dietrich resigned by telephone in May 1957 after repeated requests for stock options, which Hughes refused to grant, and with no further progress on the jet financing.&lt;ref&gt;Barlett and Steele 2011, p. 224-228.&lt;/ref&gt; As Hughes's mental state worsened, he ordered various tactics to delay payments to Boeing and Convair; his behavior led TWA's banks to insist that he be removed from management as a condition for further financing.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 1960, Hughes was ultimately forced out of management of TWA, although he continued to own 78% of the company. In 1961, TWA filed suit against Hughes Tool Company, claiming that the latter had violated antitrust law by using TWA as a captive market for aircraft trading. The claim was largely dependent upon obtaining testimony from Hughes himself. Hughes went into hiding and refused to testify. A default judgment was issued against Hughes Tool Company for $135 million in 1963, but was overturned by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in 1973, on the basis that Hughes was immune from prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/12/23/archives/just-about-everybody-versus-howard-hughes-the-strange-case-of-twa.html|title=The strange case of T.W.A. vs. Howard Hughes vs. T.W.A.|last=Brooks|first=John|date=December 23, 1973|work=The New York Times|access-date=January 10, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966, a U.S. federal court forced Hughes to sell his TWA shares because of concerns over [[conflict of interest]] between his ownership of both TWA and Hughes Aircraft. The sale of his TWA shares netted him a profit of $547&amp;nbsp;million.

Hughes acquired control of Boston-based [[Northeast Airlines]] in 1962. However, the airline's lucrative route authority between major northeastern cities and Miami was terminated by a CAB decision around the time of the acquisition, and Hughes sold control of the company to a trustee in 1964. Northeast went on to merge with [[Delta Air Lines]] in 1972.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.deltamuseum.org/exhibits/delta-history/family-tree/northeast-airlines|title=Northeast Airlines|website=www.deltamuseum.org|access-date=January 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Hughes Airwest McDonnell Douglas DC-9-31 Silagi-1.jpg|thumb|Douglas DC-9s in Hughes Airwest livery]]
In 1970, Hughes acquired [[San Francisco]]-based Air West and renaming it [[Hughes Airwest]]. Air West had been formed in 1968 by the merger of [[Bonanza Air Lines]], [[Pacific Air Lines]], and [[West Coast Airlines]], all of which operated in the western U.S. By the late 1970s, Hughes Airwest operated an all-jet fleet of [[Boeing 727-200]], [[Douglas DC-9-10]], and [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30]] jetliners serving an extensive route network in the western U.S. with flights to Mexico and western Canada as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.departedflights.com/ January 15, 1978 Hughes Airwest route map]&lt;/ref&gt; By 1980, the airline's route system reached as far east as Houston ([[Hobby Airport]]) and [[Milwaukee]] with a total of 42 destinations being served.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.departedflights.com/ September 1, 1980 Hughes Airwest system timetable]&lt;/ref&gt; Hughes Airwest was then acquired by and merged into [[Republic Airlines (1979–1986)]] in late 1980. Republic was subsequently acquired by and merged into [[Northwest Airlines]] which in turn was ultimately merged into [[Delta Air Lines]] in 2008.

==Howard Hughes Medical Institute==
{{Main|Howard Hughes Medical Institute}}

In 1953, Hughes launched the [[Howard Hughes Medical Institute]] in [[Miami, Florida]] (currently located in [[Chevy Chase (CDP), Maryland|Chevy Chase, Maryland]]) with the expressed goal of basic [[biomedical research]], including trying to understand, in Hughes' words, the "genesis of life itself," due to his lifelong interest in science and technology. Hughes' first [[Will and testament|will]], which he signed in 1925 at the age of 19, stipulated that a portion of his estate should be used to create a medical institute bearing his name.&lt;ref&gt;Brown and Broeske 1996, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; When a major battle with the IRS loomed ahead, Hughes gave all his stock in the Hughes Aircraft Company to the institute, thereby turning the aerospace and defense contractor into a for-profit entity of a fully tax-exempt charity. Hughes' internist, [[Verne Mason]], who treated Hughes after his 1946 aircraft crash, was chairman of the institute's medical advisory committee.&lt;ref&gt;"Dr. Verne Mason. Miami Physician. Howard Hughes aide dies. Also treated Pershing." ''The New York Times,'' November 17, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; The Howard Hughes Medical Institute's new board of trustees sold Hughes Aircraft in 1985 to General Motors for $5.2&amp;nbsp;billion, allowing the institute to grow dramatically.

The deal was the topic of a protracted legal battle between Hughes and the [[Internal Revenue Service]], which Hughes ultimately won. After his death in 1976, many thought that the balance of Hughes' estate would go to the institute, although it was ultimately divided among his cousins and other heirs, given the lack of a will to the contrary. The HHMI was the fourth largest private organization as of 2007 and the largest devoted to biological and medical research, with an [[Financial endowment|endowment]] of $16.3 billion as of June 2007.&lt;ref&gt;"2007 Annual Report".

==Glomar Explorer and the taking of K-129==
{{Main|USNS Glomar Explorer (T-AG-193)}}
In 1972, during the [[Cold War|cold war era]], Hughes was approached by the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] through his longtime partner, David Charnay, to help secretly recover the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[submarine]] [[Soviet submarine K-129 (1960)|K-129]], which had sunk near Hawaii four years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu//nukevault/ebb305/doc01.pdf |title=C05301269 |publisher=[[George Washington University|GWU Freedom of Information Act Research]]|accessdate=November 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hughes' involvement provided the CIA with a plausible cover story, conducting expensive civilian marine research at extreme depths and the mining of undersea [[manganese nodule]]s. The recovery plan used the special-purpose salvage vessel ''Glomar Explorer''. In the summer of 1974, ''Glomar Explorer'' attempted to raise the Soviet vessel.&lt;ref name="The Taking of K-129"&gt;{{cite book |url= https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/534584/the-taking-of-k-129-by-josh-dean/9781101984437/ |author=Josh Dean |title= The Taking of K-129: How the CIA Used Howard Hughes to Steal a Russian Sub in the Most Daring Covert Operation in History |publisher=Penguin Books |date=September 5, 2017 |page=50 |isbn= 9780525501534}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burleson 1997, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; However, during the recovery a mechanical failure in the ship's [[Grapple (tool)|grapple]] caused half of the submarine to break off and fall to the ocean floor. This section is believed to have held many of the most sought-after items, including its code book and nuclear missiles. Two nuclear-tipped torpedoes and some cryptographic machines were recovered, along with the bodies of six Soviet [[submarine]]rs who were subsequently given formal burial at sea in a filmed ceremony. The operation, known as [[Project Azorian]] (but incorrectly referred to by the press as Project Jennifer), became public in February 1975 after secret documents were released, obtained by burglars of Hughes' headquarters during a burglary in June 1974.&lt;ref&gt;Burleson 1997, pp. 157–158.&lt;/ref&gt; Though he lent his name and his company's resources to the operation, Hughes and his companies had no operational involvement in the project. The ''Glomar Explorer'' was eventually acquired by [[Transocean Inc.]] (an offshore oil and gas drilling rig company) and was sent to the scrap yard in 2015 during a large decline in oil prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kitsapsun.com/story/news/local/2017/10/26/u-s-snatched-up-russian-sub/782204001/ |title=Using Howard Hughes as cover, the U.S. snatched up a Russian sub |publisher=[[Kitsap Sun|Kitsap Sun NewsPaper Online]]|accessdate=November 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
===Early romances===
In 1929, Hughes' wife, Ella, returned to Houston and filed for divorce. Hughes dated many famous women, many of them decades younger, including [[Billie Dove]], [[Faith Domergue]], [[Bette Davis]], [[Ava Gardner]], [[Olivia de Havilland]], [[Katharine Hepburn]], [[Hedy Lamarr]], [[Ginger Rogers]], [[Janet Leigh]], [[Rita Hayworth]], [[Mamie Van Doren]] and [[Gene Tierney]]. He also proposed to [[Joan Fontaine]] several times, according to her autobiography ''No Bed of Roses''. [[Jean Harlow]] accompanied him to the premiere of ''Hell's Angels'', but [[Noah Dietrich]] wrote many years later that the relationship was strictly professional, as Hughes apparently personally disliked Harlow. In his 1971 book, ''Howard: The Amazing Mr. Hughes'', Dietrich said that Hughes genuinely liked and respected [[Jane Russell]], but never sought romantic involvement with her. According to Russell's autobiography, however, Hughes once tried to bed her after a party. Russell (who was married at the time) refused him, and Hughes promised it would never happen again. The two maintained a professional and private friendship for many years. Hughes remained good friends with Tierney who, after his failed attempts to seduce her, was quoted as saying "I don't think Howard could love anything that did not have a motor in it." Later, when Tierney's daughter Daria was born deaf and blind and with a severe [[learning disability]] because of Tierney's being exposed to [[rubella]] during her pregnancy, Hughes saw to it that Daria received the best medical care and paid all expenses.&lt;ref&gt;Tierney and Herskowitz 1978, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buys luxury yacht, fatal car accident===
In 1933, Hughes made a purchase of an unseen luxury steam yacht named the ''[[Rover (yacht)|Rover]]'', which was previously owned by British shipping magnate [[James Mackay, 1st Earl of Inchcape|Lord Inchcape]]. "I have never seen the ''Rover'' but bought it on the blue prints, photographs and the reports of Lloyd's surveyors. My experience is that the English are the most honest race in the world."&lt;ref&gt;[http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19331221-1.2.8.aspx "Lord Inchcape's Yacht Bought By American."] ''The Straits Times'' (Singapore Government), December 21, 1933.

On July 11, 1936, Hughes struck and killed a pedestrian named Gabriel S. Meyer with his car at the corner of 3rd Street and Lorraine in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/483044492.html?dids=483044492:483044492&amp;FMT=CITE&amp;FMTS=CITE:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Jul+12%2C+1936&amp;author=&amp;pub=Chicago+Tribune&amp;desc=HOWARD+HUGHES'+AUTO+KILLS+MAN+IN+HOLLYWOOD&amp;pqatl=google "Howard Hughes' auto kills man in Hollywood."] ''Chicago Tribune'', July 12, 1936.

A witness to the crash told police that Hughes was driving erratically and too fast, and that Meyer had been standing in the safety zone of a streetcar stop. Hughes was booked on suspicion of [[negligent homicide]] and held overnight in jail until his attorney, [[Neil S. McCarthy]], obtained a writ of [[habeas corpus]] for his release pending a coroner's inquest.&lt;ref&gt;[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/402103021.html?dids=402103021:402103021&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Jul+13%2C+1936&amp;author=&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;desc=Sportsman+Arrested+After+Traffic+Death&amp;pqatl=google "Sportsman Arrested After Traffic Death."] ''Los Angeles Times'', July 13, 1936.

Nancy Bayly (Watts), who was in the car with Hughes at the time of the crash, corroborated this version of the story. On July 16, 1936, Hughes was held blameless by a coroner's jury at the inquest into Meyer's death.&lt;ref&gt;[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/402113781.html?dids=402113781:402113781&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Jul+16%2C+1936&amp;author=&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;desc=Millionaire+Flyer+and+Society+Girl+Testify+at+Inquest&amp;pqatl=google "Millionaire Flyer and Society Girl testify at Inquest."] ''Los Angeles Times'', July 13, 1936. Retrieved: December 13, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Hughes told reporters outside the inquiry, "I was driving slowly and a man stepped out of the darkness in front of me."

===Marriage to Jean Peters===
On January 12, 1957, Hughes married actress [[Jean Peters]]. The couple met in the 1940s, before Peters became a film actress.&lt;ref&gt;The ''Delta Democrat-Times'' (Greenville, Mississippi), September 29, 1946, p.4.&lt;/ref&gt; They had a highly publicized romance in 1947 and there was talk of marriage, but she said she could not combine it with her career.&lt;ref name="wdc"&gt;"Interview with [[Louella Parsons]]."

"Hughes and Jean Peters." ''[[The Gadsden Times]]'', April 13, 1976, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; and he reportedly had his security officers follow her everywhere even when they were not in a relationship. Such reports were confirmed by actor [[Max Showalter]], who became a close friend of Peters while shooting ''[[Niagara (1953 film)|Niagara]]'' (1953).&lt;ref name="casey"&gt;Weaver 2004, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Showalter told in an interview that because he frequently met with Peters, Hughes' men threatened to ruin his career if he did not leave her alone.&lt;ref name="casey" /&gt;

===Nixon scandal===
Shortly before the [[United States presidential election, 1960|1960 Presidential election]], [[Richard Nixon]] was alarmed when it was revealed that his brother, [[Donald Nixon|Donald]], received a $205,000 loan from Hughes. It has long been speculated&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/the_spectator/2012/04/robert_redford_s_watergate_documentary_will_it_explain_whether_nixon_ordered_the_watergate_break_in_.html|title=A Challenge to Robert Redford|last=Rosenbaum|first=Ron|date=April 27, 2012|work=Slate|access-date=October 4, 2017|language=en-US|issn=1091-2339}}&lt;/ref&gt; that Nixon's drive to learn what the Democrats were planning in 1972 was based in part on his belief that the Democrats knew about a later bribe that his friend [[Bebe Rebozo]] had received from Hughes after Nixon took office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://lasvegassun.com/news/2005/feb/28/hughes-bribe-of-nixon-alleged/|title=Hughes bribe of Nixon alleged|newspaper=[[Las Vegas Sun]]|publisher=[[Greenspun Media Group]]|location=Las Vegas, Nevada|date=February 28, 2005|accessdate=August 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1971, Donald Nixon was collecting intelligence for his brother in preparation for the upcoming presidential election. One of his sources was [[John H. Meier]], a former business adviser of Hughes who had also worked with [[Democratic National Committee]] Chair [[Larry O'Brien]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.archives.gov/research/investigations/watergate/index.html "Records of the Watergate Special Prosecution Force."] ''archives.gov.'' Retrieved: February 25, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meier, in collaboration with former Vice President [[Hubert Humphrey]] and others, wanted to feed misinformation to the Nixon campaign. Meier told Donald that he was sure the Democrats would win the election because Larry O'Brien had a great deal of information on Richard Nixon's illicit dealings with Howard Hughes that had never been released;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.archives.gov/research/investigations/watergate/hughes-investigation.html "Campaign Contributions Task Force #804 – Hughes/Rebozo Investigation."] ''archives.gov.''

While directing ''The Outlaw'', Hughes became fixated on a small flaw in one of [[Jane Russell]]'s blouses, claiming that the fabric bunched up along a seam and gave the appearance of two nipples on each breast. He wrote a detailed memorandum to the crew on how to fix the problem. [[Richard Fleischer]], who directed ''[[His Kind of Woman]]'' with Hughes as executive producer, wrote at length in his autobiography about the difficulty of dealing with the tycoon. In his book, ''Just Tell Me When to Cry'', Fleischer explained that Hughes was fixated on trivial details and was alternately indecisive and obstinate. He also revealed that Hughes' unpredictable [[mood swing]]s made him wonder if the film would ever be completed.

In 1958, Hughes told his aides that he wanted to screen some movies at a film studio near his home. He stayed in the studio's darkened screening room for more than four months, never leaving. He ate only [[chocolate]] bars and chicken and drank only [[milk]], and was surrounded by dozens of [[Kleenex]] boxes that he continuously stacked and re-arranged. He wrote detailed memos to his aides giving them explicit instructions neither to look at him nor speak to him unless spoken to. Throughout this period, Hughes sat fixated in his chair, often naked, continually watching movies. When he finally emerged in the summer of 1958, his hygiene was terrible. He had neither bathed nor cut his hair and nails for weeks; this may have been due to [[allodynia]], which results in a pain response to stimuli that would normally not cause pain.&lt;ref name=PPM.Tennant/&gt;

After the screening room incident, Hughes moved into a [[bungalow]] at the [[Beverly Hills Hotel]] where he also rented rooms for his aides, his wife, and numerous girlfriends. He would sit naked in his bedroom with a pink hotel napkin placed over his genitals, watching movies. This may have been because Hughes found the touch of clothing painful due to allodynia. He may have watched movies to distract himself from his pain—a common practice among patients with intractable pain, especially those who do not receive adequate treatment.&lt;ref name=PPM.Tennant/&gt; In one year, Hughes spent an estimated $11&amp;nbsp;million at the hotel.

Hughes began purchasing all restaurant chains and four star hotels that had been founded within the state of [[Texas]]. This included, if for only a short period, many unknown franchises currently out of business. He placed ownership of the restaurants with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, and all licenses were resold shortly after.

Another time, he became obsessed with the 1968 film ''[[Ice Station Zebra]]'', and had it run on a continuous loop in his home. According to his aides, he watched it 150 times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,918526,00.html|title=TYCOONS: The Secret Life of Howard Hughes|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|publisher=[[TIME Inc.]]|location=New York City|date=December 13, 1976|accessdate=March 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Dave|last=Kehr|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/11/movies/11dvd.html?_r=0|title=New DVDs: 'Ice Station Zebra'|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=New York Times Company|location=New York City|date=January 11, 2005|accessdate=November 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hughes insisted on using tissues to pick up objects to insulate himself from germs. He would also notice dust, stains, or other imperfections on people's clothes and demand that they take care of them. Once one of the most visible men in America, Hughes ultimately vanished from public view, although tabloids continued to follow rumors of his behavior and whereabouts. He was reported to be terminally ill, mentally unstable, or even dead.

Injuries from numerous aircraft crashes caused Hughes to spend much of his later life in pain, and he eventually became addicted to [[codeine]], which he injected [[Intramuscular injection|intramuscularly]].&lt;ref name=PPM.Tennant/&gt; Hughes had his hair cut and nails trimmed only once a year, likely due to the pain caused by the [[Complex Regional Pain Syndrome|RSD/CRPS]], which was caused by the plane crashes.&lt;ref name=PPM.Tennant/&gt; He also stored his urine in bottles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0201/20/lklw.00.html|title=Guests Discuss the Late Howard Hughes|publisher=CNN|date=January 20, 2002|accessdate=May 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=William|last=Booth|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A7810-2004Dec17.html|title=Leo and Howard|work=[[The Washington Post]]|publisher=Nash Holdings LLC|location=Washington, DC|date=December 19, 2004|accessdate=May 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later years as a Las Vegas recluse===
The wealthy and aging Hughes, accompanied by his entourage of personal aides, began moving from one hotel to another, always taking up residence in the top floor penthouse. In the last ten years of his life, 1966 to 1976, Hughes lived in hotels in many cities—including [[Beverly Hills]], [[Boston]], [[Las Vegas]], [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]], [[Freeport, Bahamas|Freeport]], [[Vancouver]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Aaron|last=Chapman|url=http://www.vancourier.com/issues04/123204/news/123204nn1.html|title=Man of mystery|work=[[Vancouver Courier]]|publisher=[[Glacier Media]]|location=Vancouver, British Columbia|date=December 15, 2004|dead-url=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050124103855/http://www.vancourier.com/issues04/123204/news/123204nn1.html |archivedate=January 24, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[London]], [[Managua]], and [[Acapulco]].

On November 24, 1966 (Thanksgiving Day),&lt;ref name=lvrj1&gt;{{cite news|first=Corey|last=Levitan|url=https://www.reviewjournal.com/life/gritty-city/|title=Top 10 Scandals: Gritty City|work=[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]]|publisher=News + Media Capital Group LLC|location=Las Vegas, Nevada|date=March 2, 2008|accessdate=March 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hughes arrived in Las Vegas by railroad car and moved into the [[Desert Inn]]. Because he refused to leave the hotel and to avoid further conflicts with the owners, Hughes bought the Desert Inn in early 1967. The hotel's eighth floor became the nerve center of Hughes' empire and the ninth-floor penthouse became his personal residence. Between 1966 and 1968, he bought several other hotel-casinos, including the [[Castaways (casino)|Castaways]], [[New Frontier Hotel and Casino|New Frontier]], [[the Landmark Hotel and Casino]], and the [[Sands Hotel|Sands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=K.J.|last=Evans|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/howard-hughes|title=Howard Hughes|work=[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]]|publisher=News + Media Capital Group LLC|location=las Vegas, Nevada|date=February 7, 1999|accessdate=September 12, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; He bought the small [[Silver Slipper]] casino for the sole purpose of moving its trademark neon silver slipper; visible from Hughes' bedroom, it had apparently kept him awake at night.

After Hughes left the Desert Inn, hotel employees discovered that his drapes had not been opened during the time he lived there and had rotted through.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Megan|last1=Messerly|first2=J.D.|last2=Morris|title=A peek into the mind of Howard Hughes|url=https://lasvegassun.com/news/2015/dec/28/a-peek-into-the-mind-of-howard-hughes/|work=[[Las Vegas Sun]]|publisher=Greenspun Media Group|location=Las Vegas, Nevada|date=December 28, 2015|accessdate=March 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his 1954 engagement at the [[New Frontier Hotel and Casino|Last Frontier hotel]], entertainer [[Liberace]] mistook Hughes for his lighting director, instructing him to instantly bring up a blue light should he start to play "[[Suite bergamasque#"Clair de lune"|Clair de lune]]". Hughes nodded in compliance, before the hotel's entertainment director arrived and introduced Hughes to Liberace.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas 1987, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hughes wanted to change the image of Las Vegas to something more glamorous. As Hughes wrote in a memo to an aide, "I like to think of Las Vegas in terms of a well-dressed man in a dinner jacket and a beautifully jeweled and furred female getting out of an expensive car." Hughes bought several local television stations (including [[KLAS-TV]]).

Hughes' considerable business holdings were overseen by a small panel unofficially dubbed "The Mormon Mafia" because of the many [[Latter-day Saint]]s on the committee, led by [[Frank William Gay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,918528,00.html|title=The Keepers of the King|magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|publisher=[[Time, Inc.]]|location=New York City|date=December 13, 1976|accessdate=January 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to supervising day-to-day business operations and Hughes' health, they also went to great pains to satisfy Hughes' every whim. For example, Hughes once became fond of [[Baskin-Robbins]]' banana nut ice cream, so his aides sought to secure a bulk shipment for him, only to discover that Baskin-Robbins had discontinued the flavor. They put in a request for the smallest amount the company could provide for a special order, 350 gallons (1,300 L), and had it shipped from Los Angeles. A few days after the order arrived, Hughes announced he was tired of banana nut and wanted only French vanilla ice cream. The Desert Inn ended up distributing free banana nut ice cream to casino customers for a year.&lt;ref&gt;Brown and Broeske 1996, p. 341.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1996 interview, ex–Howard Hughes communicator [[Robert Maheu]] said, "There is a rumor that there is still some banana nut ice cream left in the freezer. It is most likely true."

As an owner of several major Las Vegas businesses, Hughes wielded much political and economic influence in Nevada and elsewhere. During the 1960s and early 1970s, he disapproved of underground nuclear testing at the [[Nevada Test Site]]. Hughes was concerned about the risk from residual [[Ionizing radiation|nuclear radiation]], and attempted to halt the tests. When the tests finally went through despite Hughes' efforts, the detonations were powerful enough that the entire hotel where he was staying trembled due to the shock waves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Ralph|last=Vartabedian|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-hometown-nuke28-2009jun28,0,1389110.story|title=Howard Hughes and the atomic bomb in middle of Nevada|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tronc]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date=June 28, 2009|accessdate=July 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In two separate, last-ditch maneuvers, Hughes instructed his representatives to offer million-dollar bribes to both presidents [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] and Richard Nixon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Michael|last=Carlson|title=Obituary: Robert Maheu|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/20/usa|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|location=London, England|date=August 20, 2008|accessdate=July 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, [[Jean Peters]] filed for divorce. The two had not lived together for many years. Peters requested a lifetime [[alimony]] payment of $70,000 a year, adjusted for inflation, and waived all claims to Hughes' estate. Hughes offered her a settlement of over a million dollars, but she declined it. Hughes did not insist on a [[gag order|confidentiality agreement]] from Peters as a condition of the divorce. Aides reported that Hughes never spoke ill of her. She refused to discuss her life with Hughes and declined several lucrative offers from publishers and biographers. Peters would state only that she had not seen Hughes for several years before their divorce and had only dealt with him by phone.

Hughes was living in the Intercontinental Hotel near [[Lake Managua]] in Nicaragua, seeking privacy and security,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Jay|last=Mallin|url=http://www.ineter.gob.ni/geofisica/sis/managua72/mallin/great04.htm|title=The Great Managua Earthquake|publisher=SamHar Press|location=Charlotte, New York|date=1974|dead-url=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070220073628/http://www.ineter.gob.ni/geofisica/sis/managua72/mallin/great01.html|archive-date=February 20, 2007|access-date=April 23, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; when a [[1972 Nicaragua earthquake|magnitude 6.5 earthquake]] damaged [[Managua]] in December 1972. As a precaution, Hughes moved first to a rather large tent, facing the hotel, then after a few days there to the Nicaraguan National Palace and stayed there as a guest of [[Anastasio Somoza Debayle]] before leaving for Florida on a private jet the following day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/H/history/e-h/hughes1.html "Howard Hughes: A Chronology."] ''Channel 4''. Retrieved: January 5, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently moved into the Penthouse at the Xanadu Princess Resort on [[Grand Bahama Island]], which he had recently purchased. He lived almost exclusively in the penthouse of the [[Xanadu Beach Resort &amp; Marina]] for the last four years of his life. Hughes had spent a total of $300&amp;nbsp;million on his many properties in Las Vegas.&lt;ref name=lvrj1/&gt;

====Memoir hoax====
In 1972, author [[Clifford Irving]] caused a media sensation when he claimed he had co-written an authorized autobiography of Hughes. Hughes was so reclusive that he did not immediately publicly refute Irving's statement, leading many to believe the Irving book was genuine. However, before the book's publication, Hughes finally denounced Irving in a teleconference and the entire project was eventually exposed as a hoax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/clifford-irving-dead-howard-hughes-prankster-was-87-1069918|title=Clifford Irving, Howard Hughes Prankster, Dies at 87|newspaper=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=[[Eldridge Industries]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date=December 21, 2017|accessdate=June 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Irving was later convicted of fraud and spent 17 months in prison. In 1974, the [[Orson Welles]] film ''[[F for Fake]]'' included a section on the Hughes biography hoax. In 1977, ''The Hoax'' by Clifford Irving was published in the [[United Kingdom]], telling his story of these events. The 2006 film ''[[The Hoax (film)|The Hoax]]'', starring [[Richard Gere]], is also based on these events.{{sfn|Irving|1999|p=309}}

Hughes was reported to have died on April 5, 1976, at 1:27&amp;nbsp;p.m. on board an aircraft owned by Robert Graf and piloted by Jeff Abrams. He was en route from his penthouse at the Acapulco Fairmont Princess Hotel in Mexico to [[the Methodist Hospital]] in Houston. Other accounts indicate that he died on the flight from [[Freeport, Bahamas|Freeport]], [[Grand Bahama]], to Houston.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Mark|last=Lisheron|url=http://www.statesman.com/news/content/news/stories/local/01/03/0103owensobit.html|title=Obituary for Lex Dale Owens, owner of Air Ambulance, Inc|website=Statesman.com|date=January 3, 2009|accessdate=March 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After receiving a call, his senior counsel, [[Frank P. Morse]], ordered his staff to get his body on a plane and return him to the United States. It was common that foreign countries would hold a corpse as ransom so that an estate could not be settled. Morse ordered the pilots to announce Hughes' death once they entered U.S. [[airspace]].&lt;ref name="Morse, 2015"&gt;Morse, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=January 2016}}

===Estate===
Approximately three weeks after Hughes' death, a [[Holographic will|handwritten will]] was found on the desk of an official of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints]] in [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]]. The so-called "Mormon Will" gave $1.56 billion to various charitable organizations (including $625&amp;nbsp;million to the [[Howard Hughes Medical Institute]]), nearly $470&amp;nbsp;million to the upper management in Hughes' companies and to his aides, $156&amp;nbsp;million to first cousin William Lummis, and $156&amp;nbsp;million split equally between his two ex-wives Ella Rice and [[Jean Peters]].

In this will, Hughes left his entire estate to the Hughes Medical Institute, as he had no connection to family and was seriously ill. This is contrary to the many wills that have surfaced after his death. The original will that included payments to aides never surfaced. It was apparently in a home surrounding the Desert Inn Golf Course belonging to the mother of an assistant. He had no desire to leave any money to family, aides or churches, including William Gay and Frank Morse.&lt;ref&gt;Morse, 1976&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=January 2016}} Hughes was not Mormon and had no reason to leave his estate to that church. Frank P. Morse is still the attorney of record for Hughes.

A further $156&amp;nbsp;million was endowed to a gas-station owner, [[Melvin Dummar]], who told reporters that in 1967, he found a disheveled and dirty man lying along [[U.S. Route 95]], just {{convert|150|mi|km}} north of [[Las Vegas]]. The man asked for a ride to Vegas. Dropping him off at the [[Sands Hotel]], Dummar said the man told him that he was Hughes. Dummar later claimed that days after Hughes' death a "mysterious man" appeared at his gas station, leaving an envelope containing the will on his desk. Unsure if the will was genuine and unsure of what to do, Dummar left the will at the LDS Church office. In 1978, a [[Nevada]] court ruled the Mormon Will a forgery, and officially declared that Hughes had died intestate (without a valid will). Dummar's story was later adapted into [[Jonathan Demme]]'s film ''[[Melvin and Howard]]'' in 1980.

Hughes' $2.5&amp;nbsp;billion estate was eventually split in 1983 among 22 cousins, including William Lummis, who serves as a trustee of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. The [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ruled that [[Hughes Aircraft]] was owned by the [[Howard Hughes Medical Institute]], which sold it to [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] in 1985 for $5.2&amp;nbsp;billion. The court rejected suits by the states of California and Texas that claimed they were owed [[inheritance tax]]. In 1984 Hughes' estate paid an undisclosed amount to [[Terry Moore (actress)|Terry Moore]], who claimed she and Hughes had secretly married on a yacht in [[international waters]] off [[Mexico]] in 1949 and never divorced. Moore never produced proof of a marriage, but her book, ''The Beauty and the Billionaire,'' became a bestseller.
