Captain '''Sir John William''' "'''Jack'''" '''Alcock''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%||KBE|DSC}} (5 November 1892{{spaced ndash}}18 December 1919) was a  [[Royal Navy]] and later [[Royal Air Force]] officer who, with navigator Lieutenant [[Arthur Whitten Brown]], piloted the [[Alcock and Brown|first non-stop transatlantic flight]] from [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] to [[Clifden]], [[Connemara]], Ireland. He died in a flying accident in France in 1919.

==Early life==
John Alcock was born on 5 November 1892 at Basford House on Seymour Grove, [[Firswood]], [[Manchester]], [[England]]. He attended St Thomas's Primary School in [[Heaton Chapel]], [[Stockport]] and Heyhouses School in [[Lytham St Annes]].&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.st-thomasheaton.stockport.sch.uk/1919.htm St. Thomas's, Stockport] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005211158/http://www.st-thomasheaton.stockport.sch.uk/1919.htm |date=5 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Blue Plaques|url=http://www.lsacivic.org/215-2/|work=Lytham St Annes Civic Society|accessdate=10 August 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826120703/http://www.lsacivic.org/215-2/|archivedate=26 August 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He first became interested in flying at the age of 17. His first job was at the Empress Motor Works in Manchester. In 1910 he became an assistant to Works Manager Charles Fletcher, an early Manchester aviator&lt;ref&gt;Scholefield p.212&lt;/ref&gt; and Norman Crossland, a motor engineer and founder of Manchester Aero Club. It was during this period that Alcock met the Frenchman [[Maurice Ducrocq]] who was both a demonstration pilot and UK sales representative for aero engines made by the Italian [[Spirito Mario Viale]].

Ducrocq took Alcock on as a mechanic at the [[Brooklands]] aerodrome, Surrey, where he learned to fly at Ducrocq's flying school, gaining his pilot's licence there in November 1912. Alcock then joined the [[Sunbeam Motor Car Company]] as a racing pilot. By summer 1914 he was proficient enough to compete in a Hendon-Birmingham-Manchester and return air race, flying a [[Farman]] biplane. He landed at [[Trafford Park Aerodrome (Manchester)|Trafford Park Aerodrome]] and flew back to Hendon the same day.

==Military career==
At the outbreak of World War I, Alcock joined the [[Royal Naval Air Service]] as a warrant-officer instructor at the [[Royal Naval Flying School]] at [[RAF Eastchurch|Eastchurch]] in [[Kent]]. It was whilst at Eastchurch that Alcock received his commission as a flight sub-lieutenant in December 1915. In 1916 he was transferred to a squadron operating at [[Moudros]], on the Greek island of [[Lemnos]]. While stationed at Moudros he conceived and built the  ''[[Alcock Scout]]'', a fighter aircraft built out of the remnants of unused and abandoned aircraft.

On 30 September 1917, whilst piloting a [[Sopwith Camel]] Alcock attacked three enemy aircraft, forcing two to crash into the sea. For this action he was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Service Cross]]. After returning to base he then piloted a Handley Page bomber on a raid to [[Constantinople]]. He was forced to turn back to base after an engine failed near [[Gallipoli]]. After flying on a single engine for more than 60 miles, that engine failed and the aircraft ditched in the sea, near [[Suvla Bay]]. Alcock and his crew of two were unable to attract nearby British destroyers, and when the plane finally began to sink they swam for an hour to reach the enemy-held shore. All three were taken prisoner next day by the Turkish forces. Alcock remained a prisoner of war until the Armistice and retired from the Royal Air Force in March 1919.

==First non-stop flight across the Atlantic==

{{Main article|Transatlantic flight of Alcock and Brown}}
After the war Alcock became a test pilot for Vickers and took up the challenge of attempting to be the first to fly directly across the [[Atlantic]].  Alcock and [[Arthur Whitten Brown]] took off from St John's, Newfoundland, at 1:45 pm local time on 14 June 1919, and landed in Derrygimla bog near Clifden, Ireland, 16 hours and 12 minutes later on 15 June 1919 after flying {{convert|1980|miles|km|abbr=on}}. The flight had been much affected by bad weather, making accurate navigation difficult; the intrepid duo also had to cope with turbulence, instrument failure, and ice on the wings. The flight was made in a modified [[Vickers Vimy]] bomber and won a [[Daily Mail aviation prizes|£10,000 prize]] offered by London's ''[[Daily Mail]]'' newspaper for the first non-stop flight across the Atlantic.

A few days after the flight both Alcock and Brown were honoured with a reception at [[Windsor Castle]] during which [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] invested them with their insignia as [[Order of the British Empire|Knights Commanders of the Order of the British Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msim.org.uk/media/161884/captain%20jack%20alcock.pdf |format=PDF |title=Captain Jack Alcock (1892–1919) |publisher=Museum of Science &amp; Industry, Manchester, England |accessdate=2008-04-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410194708/http://www.msim.org.uk/media/161884/captain%20jack%20alcock.pdf |archivedate=10 April 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alcock was present at the [[Science Museum (London)|Science Museum]] in [[London]] on 15 December 1919 when the recovered Vimy aircraft was presented to the nation.

==Death==
On 18 December 1919, Alcock was piloting a new Vickers amphibious aircraft, the [[Vickers Viking]], to the first post-war aeronautical exhibition in [[Paris]] when he crashed in fog at [[Cottévrard]], near [[Rouen]] in [[Normandy]]. Alcock suffered a fractured skull and never regained consciousness after being transferred to a hospital in Rouen.

His grave in [[Southern Cemetery, Manchester]] is marked by a large stone memorial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John William Alcock|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/10709883|publisher=Find A Grave|accessdate=13 September 2013|author=|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
