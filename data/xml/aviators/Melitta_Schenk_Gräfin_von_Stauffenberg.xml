'''Melitta Schenk Gräfin&lt;ref&gt;{{german title|Gräfin}}&lt;/ref&gt; von Stauffenberg''', born '''Melitta Schiller''' (3 January 1903 &amp;ndash; 8 April 1945)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Amazons to Fighter Pilots - A Biographical Dictionary of Military Women (Volume 2).|last=Pennington|first=Reina|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=2003|isbn=0-313-29197-7|location=Westport, Connecticut|pages=416-418}}&lt;/ref&gt;, was an [[aviatrix]] who served as a [[test pilot]] in the [[Luftwaffe]] before and during [[World War II]].

She was the second German woman to be awarded the honorary title of ''[[Flugkapitän]]'' ({{lang-en|flight captain}}) and also flew over 2,500 test flights in [[dive bomber]]s, the second most of any Luftwaffe test pilot. Von Stauffenberg was awarded the [[Iron Cross|Iron Cross Second Class]] and the [[Front Flying Clasp of the Luftwaffe|Gold Front Flying Clasp for Bombers]] with diamonds, for performing over 1,500 test flights in dive bomber aircraft. In 1944, she was arrested with other [[Stauffenberg]] family members on suspicion of conspiring with her brothers-in-law to [[20 July plot|assassinate]] [[Adolf Hitler]], but she was later released to continue her test flight duties.

Countess von Stauffenberg died after being shot down by an [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] fighter plane on 8 April 1945.

==Biography==
Melitta was born in [[Krotoszyn|Krotoschin]], [[Prussia]].  Her father was Michael Schiller. Her mother was Margaret Eberstein. She had four siblings: Marie-Luise, Otto, Jutta and Klara. The family moved to [[Jelenia Góra|Hirschberg]] in [[Silesia]].

===Early life===
Melitta passed the diploma for university entrance in 1922. There she studied [[mathematics]], [[physics]] and [[Engineering]], eventually specialising in aeronautical engineering at the [[Technical University of Munich]]. In 1927 she graduated ''[[cum laude]]''.

===Aviation experience===
Melitta started working for the ''[[Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Luftfahrt]]'' (DVL), an experimental institute for aviation, in Berlin-Adlershof in 1928. She also took flying lessons. She married the historian [[Alexander Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg]] in 1937.

On 28 October 1937, she qualified as a ''Flugkapitänin'', or "aircraft captain", a rank reserved for test pilots in Germany at the time, and became only the second woman in Germany, after [[Hanna Reitsch]], to achieve this. She eventually gained licences for all classes of powered aircraft, the acrobatic flying licence, and the [[Glider (sailplane)|glider]] licence.

===World War II===
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2011}}
At the beginning of [[World War II]], Melitta wanted to work for the [[Red Cross]] but was ordered to become a [[test pilot]] for the ''Luftwaffe'' at [[Rechlin-Lärz Airfield|the central ''Erprobungsstelle'' test facility]] in [[Rechlin]], [[Mecklenburg]]. She did test dives in warplanes, up to 15 times a day, from a height of 4,000 metres. 
From 1942, Melitta Schenk Gräfin von Stauffenberg continued her test-flights at the Luftwaffe's technical academy in [[RAF Gatow|Berlin-Gatow]]. She was attacked by Allied aircraft, and was awarded the [[Iron Cross|Iron Cross 2nd Class]] on 22 January 1943. She made her dissertation for her Masters qualification in 1944, and received an A grade. She then became technical chief of the ''Versuchsstelle für Flugsondergeräte'', another test institute, in the same year.

When the 20 July plot failed, she was arrested with the rest of the [[Stauffenberg]] family. Although her two brothers-in-law, [[Claus von Stauffenberg|Claus]] and [[Berthold Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg|Berthold]] were executed and the other adult members were held in concentration camps, she was released on 2 September, because of the military importance of her work. As the name von Stauffenberg was anything but popular among the Nazis, she was now officially addressed as "Gräfin Schenk" instead of "Gräfin Schenk von Stauffenberg". Her husband and her sisters-in-law were confined in concentration camps, and the Stauffenberg children were taken away from their mothers. Melitta used her prominent position to help as much as she could.

She felt loyal to Germany, but not to the [[National Socialist German Workers Party|National Socialists]]. She therefore supported the Luftwaffe, but she confessed in her diaries that this moral conflict tormented her. {{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

===Death===
On 8 April 1945, while transferring a small [[Bü 181 Bestmann]] trainer to southern Germany, Gräfin von Stauffenberg was shot down by a U.S. fighter{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} near [[Straßkirchen]], [[Bavaria]]. She crash-landed the aircraft and was conscious when civilians arrived to help. She asked for assistance to get out of the aircraft, and was extracted from the aircraft alive. The civilians reported her most serious injury appeared to be a broken leg. A local doctor, Hans Siegl from Straßkirchen, arrived at the scene but was told a military doctor had attended von Stauffenberg's injuries and his services were not needed. Von Stauffenberg's injuries did not appear life threatening, but she died two hours later. Her remains were taken to the hospital in [[Straubing]], where the town mortuary book noted as the cause of death "...skull base fracture, tearing of the left thigh, fracture of the right ankle."
