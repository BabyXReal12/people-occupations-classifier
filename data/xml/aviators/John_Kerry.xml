'''John Forbes Kerry''' (born December 11, 1943) is an American politician who served as the [[List of Secretaries of State of the United States|68th]] [[United States Secretary of State]] from 2013 to 2017. A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], Kerry previously represented [[Massachusetts]] in the [[United States Senate]] from 1985 to 2013. He was the Democratic nominee in the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential election]], losing to [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] incumbent [[George W. Bush]].

Kerry was born in [[Aurora, Colorado]] and attended [[boarding school]] in [[Massachusetts]] and [[New Hampshire]]. He graduated from [[Yale University]] in 1966 with a major in [[political science]]. Kerry enlisted in the [[United States Naval Reserve|Naval Reserve]] in 1966, and between 1968 and 1969, he served an abbreviated four-month tour of duty in [[South Vietnam]] as [[Duty officer|officer-in-charge]] (OIC) of a [[Patrol Craft Fast|Swift Boat]]. For that service, he was awarded combat medals that include the [[Silver Star Medal]], [[Bronze Star Medal]] and three [[Purple Heart Medals]]. Securing an early return to the United States, Kerry joined the [[Vietnam Veterans Against the War]] organization in which he served as a nationally recognized spokesman and as an outspoken [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|opponent of the Vietnam War]]. He appeared in the [[Fulbright Hearings]] before the Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs where he deemed United States war policy in Vietnam to be the cause of [[war crimes]].

After receiving a [[Juris Doctor]] from [[Boston College Law School]], Kerry worked as an [[Assistant District Attorney]] in Massachusetts. He served as [[Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts|Lieutenant Governor]] under [[Michael Dukakis]] from 1983 to 1985 and was elected to the U.S. Senate in [[United States Senate election in Massachusetts, 1984|1984]] and was sworn in the following January. On the [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations|Senate Foreign Relations Committee]], he led a [[Kerry Committee report|series of hearings]] from 1987 to 1989 which were a precursor to the [[Iran–Contra affair]]. Kerry was reelected to additional terms in [[United States Senate election in Massachusetts, 1990|1990]], [[United States Senate election in Massachusetts, 1996|1996]], [[United States Senate election in Massachusetts, 2002|2002]] and [[United States Senate election in Massachusetts, 2008|2008]]. On October 11, 2002, Kerry voted to authorize the President "to use force, if necessary, to disarm [[Saddam Hussein]]," but warned that the administration should exhaust its diplomatic avenues before launching war.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=107&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00237 107th Congress-2nd Session 237th Roll Call Vote by members of the Senate], October 11, 2002. Retrieved 9 January 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential campaign]], Kerry criticized [[George W. Bush]] for the [[Iraq War]]. He and his running mate, U.S. Senator from North Carolina [[John Edwards]], lost the election, finishing 35 [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral votes]] behind Bush and [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Dick Cheney]]. Kerry returned to the Senate, becoming Chairman of the [[Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship]] in 2007 and then of the Foreign Relations Committee in 2009. In January 2013, Kerry was nominated by President [[Barack Obama]] to succeed outgoing Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] and then confirmed by the U.S. Senate, assuming the office on February 1, 2013. Kerry retained the position until the end of Obama's tenure on [[Inauguration of Donald Trump|January 20, 2017]].

==Early life and education (1943–1966)==
John Forbes Kerry was born on December 11, 1943 at [[Fitzsimons Army Medical Center]] in [[Aurora, Colorado]]. He is the second of four children born to [[Richard John Kerry]], a Foreign Service officer and lawyer, and [[Rosemary Forbes Kerry|Rosemary Isabel Forbes]], a nurse and social activist. His father was raised [[Catholic]] (John's paternal grandparents were [[Austro-Hungarian]] [[Jews|Jewish]] immigrants who converted to Catholicism) and his mother was [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalian]]. He was raised with an elder sister named Margaret, a younger sister named Diana, and a younger brother named [[Cameron Kerry|Cameron]]. The children were raised in their father's Catholic faith, and John served as an [[altar server|altar boy]].&lt;ref name=ReligionBackground&gt;{{cite web|last=Caldwell|first=Deborah|title=Not a Prodigal Son|url=http://www.beliefnet.com/News/Politics/2004/08/Not-A-Prodigal-Son.aspx|publisher=beliefnet.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kerry grew up a [[military brat]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |title=Army Brats Soar |url=http://www.ausa.org/publications/armymagazine/archive/2014/Documents/11November14/SteeleBrats_November2014.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402124238/http://www.ausa.org/publications/armymagazine/archive/2014/Documents/11November14/SteeleBrats_November2014.pdf |magazine=Army Magazine |format=pdf |date=November 11, 2014 |accessdate=July 2, 2016 |archivedate=April 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; until his father was discharged from the [[United States Army Air Corps|Army Air Corps]], causing the family to settle in [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2267657/Sen-John-Kerry-chokes-talking-diplomat-father-gets-kiss-approval-Hillary-Clinton-Secretary-State-confirmation-hearing.html|title=Sen.

His maternal extended family enjoyed great wealth as members of the [[Forbes family|Forbes]] and [[Dudley–Winthrop family|Dudley–Winthrop]] families.&lt;ref name="news.google.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=KrRAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=8yAGAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5080,615343&amp;dq=robert+winthrop+john+kerry&amp;hl=en|title='Outsider' label follows Kerry in Massachusetts despite years in office|newspaper=News-Sentinel|date=July 6, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kerry's parents themselves were [[upper-middle class]], and a wealthy [[great aunt|great-aunt]] paid for him to attend elite [[boarding schools]].&lt;ref name="ReligionBackground"/&gt;

In 1957, his father was stationed at the U.S. Embassy in [[Oslo]], [[Norway]], and Kerry was sent back to the United States to attend boarding school. He first attended the [[Fessenden School]] in [[Newton, Massachusetts]], and later [[St. Paul's, Concord, New Hampshire]], where he learned skills in [[public speaking]] and began developing an interest in [[politics]].&lt;ref name="ReligionBackground"/&gt; Kerry founded the [[John Winant]] Society at St. Paul's to debate the issues of the day; the Society still exists there.&lt;ref name="navydove"&gt;{{cite news|first=Samuel Z.|last=Goldhaber|title=John Kerry: A Navy Dove Runs for Congress|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=352185|date=February 18, 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="citm-pt1"&gt;{{cite news|first=Michael|last=Kranish|title=A privileged youth, a taste for risk|url=http://www.boston.com/globe/nation/packages/kerry/061503.shtml|work=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=June 15, 2003|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030801233903/http://www.boston.com/globe/nation/packages/kerry/061503.shtml|archivedate=August 1, 2003|accessdate=July 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:KN-C23433-JFK with wife Jackie and John Kerry among others.jpg|thumb|A young John Kerry (in white) aboard the yacht of [[John F. Kennedy]], in 1962]]
In 1962, Kerry entered [[Yale University]], majoring in [[political science]] and residing in [[Jonathan Edwards College]].&lt;ref name="Kerry-GlobeBio"/&gt;{{rp|35}} While at Yale, Kerry briefly dated [[Janet Auchincloss Rutherfurd|Janet Auchincloss]], the younger half-sister of [[First Lady]] [[Jacqueline Kennedy]]. Through Auchincloss, Kerry was invited to a day of sailing with then-President [[John F.

Kerry played on the varsity [[Yale Bulldogs Men's soccer]] team, earning his only letter in his senior year. He also played freshman and JV [[Yale Bulldogs men's ice hockey|hockey]] and, in his senior year, JV [[Yale Bulldogs men's lacrosse|lacrosse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=merron/kerry/040726|title=ESPN.com: Page 2 : Rink turns and big deals|date=|work=go.com|accessdate=August 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he was a member of the Psi Upsilon fraternity and took flying lessons.&lt;ref name="Kerry-GlobeBio" /&gt;{{rp|37, 43}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2003/02/14/kerry-66-he-was-going-to-be-president/|title=Kerry '66: 'He was going to be president'|date=|work=Yale Daily News|accessdate=August 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his [[sophomore]] year, Kerry became the Chairman of the Liberal Party of the [[Yale Political Union]], and a year later he served as President of the Union. Amongst his influential teachers in this period was Professor [[H. Bradford Westerfield]], who was himself a former President of the Political Union.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/27/education/27westerfield.html?scp=1&amp;sq=H.+Bradford+Westerfield&amp;st=nyt Martin, Douglas.

January 27, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; His involvement with the Political Union gave him an opportunity to be involved with important issues of the day, such as the [[civil rights movement]] and the [[New Frontier]] program. He also became a [[List of Skull and Bones members|member]] of [[Skull and Bones|Skull and Bones Society]], and traveled to Switzerland&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yaledailynews.com/news/university-news/2007/01/22/at-50-aiesec-ponders-its-future|title=At 50, AIESEC ponders its future|publisher=Yale Daily News|date=January 22, 2007|accessdate=March 12, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100419033955/http://www.yaledailynews.com/news/university-news/2007/01/22/at-50-aiesec-ponders-its-future/|archivedate=April 19, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; through [[AIESEC]] Yale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aiesec.org/AI|title=Welcome to AIESEC|publisher=Aiesec.org|accessdate=March 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yale.edu/aiesec|title=AIESEC Yale|publisher=Yale.edu|accessdate=April 22, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130217121541/http://www.yale.edu/aiesec/|archivedate=February 17, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the guidance of the speaking coach and history professor [[Rollin G. Osterweis]], Kerry won many debates against other college students from across the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://images.library.yale.edu/madid/oneItem.aspx?id=1780700&amp;q=john%20kerry%20debate&amp;q1=&amp;q2=&amp;qc1=&amp;qc2=&amp;qf1=&amp;qf2=&amp;qn=&amp;qo=&amp;qm=&amp;qs=&amp;sid=&amp;qx=|title=Yale Debate Team, 1965–1966, Yale University Manuscripts &amp; Archives Digital Images Database, Yale University|publisher=Images.library.yale.edu|date=June 18, 2013|accessdate=June 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1965, as the Vietnam War escalated, he won the Ten Eyck prize as the best [[orator]] in the junior class for a speech that was critical of U.S. [[foreign policy]]. In the speech he said, "It is the spectre of Western [[imperialism]] that causes more fear among Africans and Asians than communism and thus, it is self-defeating."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2003/02/14/kerry-66-he-was-going-to-be-president|title=Kerry '66: 'He was going to be president'|accessdate=December 22, 2012|last=Leibenluft|first=Jacob|date=February 14, 2003|publisher=Yale Daily News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kerry graduated from Yale with a [[Bachelor of Arts degree]] in 1966. Overall, he had lackluster [[Grading (education)|grades]], graduating with a cumulative average of 76 over his four years. His freshman-year average was a 71, but he improved to an 81 average for his senior year. He never received an "A" during his time at Yale; his highest grade was an 89.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kranish|first=Michael|date=June 7, 2005|title=Yale grades portray Kerry as a lackluster student|url=http://archive.boston.com/news/education/higher/articles/2005/06/07/yale_grades_portray_kerry_as_a_lackluster_student/?page=full|newspaper=The Boston Globe|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815185643/http://www.boston.com:80/news/education/higher/articles/2005/06/07/yale_grades_portray_kerry_as_a_lackluster_student/?page=full|archivedate=August 15, 2012|deadurl=no|accessdate=July 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military service (1966–1970)==
{{Main|Military career of John Kerry}}

===Duty on the USS ''Gridley''===
On February 18, 1966, Kerry enlisted in the Naval Reserve.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20040723192004/http://www.johnkerry.com/pdf/jkmilservice/Request_For_History_of_Service.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; He began his active duty military service on August 19, 1966. After completing 16 weeks of [[Officer Candidate School]] at the U.S. Naval Training Center in [[Newport, Rhode Island]], Kerry received his officer's commission on December 16, 1966. During the 2004 election, Kerry posted his military records at his website, and permitted reporters to inspect his medical records. In 2005, Kerry released his military and medical records to the representatives of three news organizations, but has not authorized full public access to those records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Michael |last=Kranish |title=Kerry allows Navy release of military, medical records |url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2005/06/07/kerry_allows_navy_release_of_military_medical_records/ |date=June 7, 2005 | work=The Boston Globe}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Josh |last=Gerstein |title=Kerry Grants Three Reporters Broad Access to Navy Records |url=http://www.nysun.com/article/15790 |date=June 21, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his tour on the [[guided missile]] [[frigate]] {{USS|Gridley|DLG-21|6}}, Kerry requested duty in South Vietnam, listing as his first preference a position as the commander of a [[Fast Patrol Craft]] (PCF), also known as a "Swift boat."&lt;ref name="rqstswiftboat"&gt;[http://fl1.findlaw.com/news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/jkerry/rqstswiftboat.pdf Official Record Copy of request for duty in Vietnam]. Retrieved November 4, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; These {{convert|50|ft|m|adj=on}} boats have [[aluminum]] [[hull (watercraft)|hulls]] and have little or no armor, but are heavily armed and rely on speed. "I didn't really want to get involved in the war", Kerry said in a book of Vietnam reminiscences published in 1986. "When I signed up for the swift boats, they had very little to do with the war. They were engaged in coastal patrolling and that's what I thought I was going to be doing."&lt;ref name="citm-pt2"&gt;{{cite news|first=Michael |last=Kranish |title=Heroism, and growing concern about war |url=http://www.boston.com/globe/nation/packages/kerry/061603.shtml |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=June 16, 2003|accessdate=July 7, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030801234002/http://www.boston.com/globe/nation/packages/kerry/061603.shtml|archivedate=August 1, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, his second choice of billet was on a river patrol boat, or "[[Patrol boat, rigid|PBR]]", which at the time was serving a more dangerous duty on the rivers of Vietnam.&lt;ref name="rqstswiftboat" /&gt;

===Military honors===
During the night of December 2 and early morning of December 3, 1968, Kerry was in charge of a small boat operating near a peninsula north of [[Cam Ranh Bay]] together with a Swift boat (PCF-60). According to Kerry and the two crewmen who accompanied him that night, Patrick Runyon and William Zaladonis, they surprised a group of Vietnamese men unloading [[sampan]]s at a river crossing, who began running and failed to obey an order to stop. As the men fled, Kerry and his crew opened fire on the sampans and destroyed them, then rapidly left. During this encounter, Kerry received a shrapnel wound in the left arm above the elbow. It was for this injury that Kerry received his first [[Purple Heart|Purple Heart Medal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/2004/04/17/kerry_purple/index.html |publisher=Salon |title=John Kerry's first Purple Heart |first=Douglas |last=Brinkley |accessdate=January 3, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/658F4pZWb?url=http://www.salon.com/2004/04/17/kerry_purple/ |archivedate=February 1, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kerry received his second Purple Heart for a wound received in action on the [[Bồ Đề River]] on February 20, 1969. The plan had been for the Swift boats to be accompanied by support helicopters. On the way up the Bo De, however, the helicopters were attacked. As the Swift boats reached the [[Cửa Lớn River]], Kerry's boat was hit by a [[RPG-2|B-40 rocket]] (rocket propelled grenade round), and a piece of [[shrapnel shell|shrapnel]] hit Kerry's left leg, wounding him. Thereafter, enemy fire ceased and his boat reached the [[Gulf of Thailand]] safely. Kerry continues to have shrapnel embedded in his left thigh because the doctors that first treated him decided to remove the damaged tissue and close the wound with [[surgical suture|sutures]] rather than make a wide opening to remove the shrapnel.&lt;ref name="Rasmussen1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kerryvietnam.org/PDFs/Doyle.pdf|title=Primary Sources: John Kerry's Vietnam Medals|first=Eric|last=Rasmussen|year=2004|work=Truth and Unfit for Command A Review|publisher=kerryvietnam.org|accessdate=September 5, 2013|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though wounded like several others earlier that day, Kerry did not lose any time off from duty.&lt;ref name="Rasmussen2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kerryvietnam.org/PDFs/SeaLords324.pdf|title=Primary Sources: John Kerry's Vietnam Medals|first=Eric|last=Rasmussen|year=2004|work=Truth and Unfit for Command A Review|publisher=kerryvietnam.org|accessdate=September 5, 2013|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rasmussen3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kerryvietnam.org/PDFs/SeaLords312-316.pdf|title=Part I: John Kerry in Vietnam|first=Eric|last=Rasmussen|year=2004|work=Truth and Unfit for Command A Review|publisher=kerryvietnam.org|accessdate=September 5, 2013|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Silver Star====
Eight days later, on February 28, 1969, came the events for which Kerry was awarded his [[Silver Star Medal]]. On this occasion, Kerry was in tactical command of his Swift boat and two other Swift boats during a combat operation. Their mission on the [[Duong Keo River]] included bringing an underwater demolition team and dozens of South Vietnamese Marines to destroy enemy [[sampan]]s, structures and bunkers as described in the story ''The Death Of PCF 43''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mwweb.com/ndc/SwiftBoats/pcf43.htm |title=LTJG Peter N. Upton, ''The Death Of PCF 43'' |publisher=Mwweb.com |date=April 12, 1969 |accessdate=March 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Running into heavy small arms fire from the river banks, Kerry "directed the units to turn to the beach and charge the [[Viet Cong]] positions" and he "expertly directed" his boat's fire causing the enemy to flee while at the same time coordinating the insertion of the ninety South Vietnamese troops (according to the original medal citation signed by Admiral Zumwalt). Moving a short distance upstream, Kerry's boat was the target of a B-40 rocket round; Kerry charged the enemy positions and as his boat [[Heaving to|hove to]] and [[Beaching (nautical)|beached]], a Viet Cong ("VC") insurgent armed with a rocket launcher emerged from a [[spider hole]] and ran. While the boat's gunner opened fire, wounding the VC in the leg, and while the other boats approached and offered cover fire, Kerry jumped from the boat to pursue the VC insurgent, subsequently killing him and capturing his loaded rocket launcher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fl1.findlaw.com/news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/jkerry/jksilverstar.pdf |title=Silver Star Medal – John F.

Kerry's commanding officer, [[Lieutenant Commander]] George Elliott, stated to [[Douglas Brinkley]] in 2003 that he did not know whether to court-martial Kerry for beaching the boat without orders or give him a medal for saving the crew. Elliott recommended Kerry for the Silver Star, and Zumwalt flew into An Thoi to personally award medals to Kerry and the rest of the sailors involved in the mission. The Navy's account of Kerry's actions is presented in the original [[s:Silver Star Citation - John Kerry|medal citation]] signed by Zumwalt. The engagement was documented in an after-action report, a press release written on March 1, 1969, and a historical summary dated March 17, 1969.&lt;ref name=Rasmussen6&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kerryvietnam.org/PDFs/Monthly_Historical_Summary.pdf|title=Primary Sources: John Kerry's Vietnam Medals|first=Eric|last=Rasmussen|year=2004|work=Truth and Unfit for Command A Review|publisher=kerryvietnam.org|accessdate=September 5, 2013|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bronze Star====
On March 13, 1969, on the Bái Háp River, Kerry was in charge of one of five Swift boats that were returning to their base after performing an [[Operation Sealords]] mission to transport South Vietnamese troops from the garrison at [[Cái Nước]] and [[MIKE Force]] advisors for a raid on a Vietcong camp located on the Rach Dong Cung canal. Earlier in the day, Kerry received a slight shrapnel wound in the buttocks from blowing up a rice bunker. Debarking some but not all of the passengers at a small village, the boats approached a fishing [[weir]]; one group of boats went around to the left of the weir, hugging the shore, and a group with Kerry's PCF-94 boat went around to the right, along the shoreline. A mine was detonated directly beneath the lead boat, PCF-3, as it crossed the weir to the left, lifting PCF-3 "about 2-3 ft out of water".&lt;ref name=Rasmussen7&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kerryvietnam.org/PDFs/SeaLords358.pdf|title=Primary Sources: John Kerry's Vietnam Medals|first=Eric|last=Rasmussen|year=2004|work=Truth and Unfit for Command A Review|publisher=kerryvietnam.org|accessdate=September 5, 2013|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Rassmann]], a [[United States Army Special Forces|Green Beret]] advisor who was aboard Kerry's PCF-94, was knocked overboard when, according to witnesses and the documentation of the event, a mine or rocket exploded close to the boat. According to the documentation for the event, Kerry's arm was injured when he was thrown against a bulkhead during the explosion. PCF 94 returned to the scene and Kerry rescued Rassmann who was receiving sniper fire from the water. Kerry received the [[Bronze Star Medal]] with [[Combat "V"]] for "heroic achievement", for his actions during this incident; he also received his third Purple Heart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fl1.findlaw.com/news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/jkerry/jkbronzestar.pdf |title=Bronze Star Medal – John F. Kerry |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=March 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return from Vietnam===
After Kerry's third qualifying wound, he was entitled per Navy regulations to reassignment away from combat duties. Kerry's preferred choice for reassignment was as a military aide in Boston, [[New York City]] or [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://files.findlaw.com/news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/jkerry/thricewnd.pdf "Thrice wounded"], Official Record Copy via ''findlaw.com'', March 2, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; On April 11, 1969, he reported to the [[Brooklyn, New York|Brooklyn]]-based Atlantic [[Military Sea Transportation Service]], where he would remain on active duty for the following year as a personal aide to an officer, Rear Admiral Walter Schlech. On January 1, 1970, Kerry was temporarily promoted to full [[lieutenant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.johnkerry.com/about/Temporary_Orders_and_Ranks.pdf |title=Temporary Orders and Ranks (Internet Archive mirror) |accessdate=September 8, 2006 |author=United States Navy |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040426002850/http://www.johnkerry.com/about/Temporary_Orders_and_Ranks.pdf |archivedate=April 26, 2004 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kerry had agreed to an extension of his active duty obligation from December 1969 to August 1970 in order to perform Swift Boat duty.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/jkerry/rqstswiftboat.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/jkerry/releaseactduty.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; John Kerry was on active duty in the United States Navy from August 1966 until January 1970.

===Controversy===
{{Main|John Kerry military service controversy}}
With the continuing [[George W. Bush military service controversy|controversy]] that had surrounded the military service of [[George W. Bush]] since the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 Presidential election]] (when he was accused of having used his father's political influence to gain entrance to the [[Texas Air National Guard]], thereby protecting himself from conscription into the [[United States Army]], and possible service in the [[Vietnam War]]), John Kerry's contrasting status as a decorated Vietnam War veteran posed a problem for Bush's re-election campaign, which Republicans sought to counter by calling Kerry's war record into question. As the presidential campaign of 2004 developed, approximately 250 members of a group called [[Swift Boat Veterans for Truth]] (SBVT, later renamed Swift Vets and POWs for Truth) opposed Kerry's campaign. The group held press conferences, ran ads and endorsed a book questioning Kerry's service record and his military awards. The group included several members of Kerry's unit, such as Larry Thurlow, who commanded a swift boat alongside of Kerry's,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5765243/ns/msnbc_tv-about_msnbc_tv |title='Hardball with Chris Matthews' for August 19 |publisher=[[MSNBC]] |date=August 19, 2004 |accessdate=April 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Stephen Gardner, who served on Kerry's boat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,599034,00.html | work=Time | first=Douglas | last=Brinkley | title=The Tenth Brother | date=March 9, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign inspired the widely used political pejorative '[[swiftboating]]', to describe an unfair or untrue political attack.&lt;ref name="Casey"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/dissent/v056/56.2.casey.html |title=No redemption song: The Case of Bill Ayers |last=Casey |first=Leo |date=Spring 2009 |work=Dissent |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |volume=56 |number=2 |pages=107–111 |issn=0012-3846 |doi=10.1353/dss.0.0041 |quote=In recent elections, the patriotism and good names of Democratic war hero candidates, from John Kerry to Max Cleland, had been impugned so successfully that a neologism for such smears—to 'swift boat'—was coined out of the assault on Kerry.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of Kerry's former crewmates have stated that SBVT's allegations are false.&lt;ref&gt;

==Anti-war activism (1970–1971)==
{{Main|Vietnam Veterans Against the War}}
After returning to the United States, Kerry joined the [[Vietnam Veterans Against the War]] (VVAW).&lt;ref name=Fire&gt;{{cite book | last1=O'Donnell |first1=Lawrence |date=2017 |title="Playing with Fire – The 1968 Elections and the Transformation of American Politics” |edition=1st |publisher=[[Penguin Press]] |page=6 |isbn=9780399563140}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then numbering about 20,000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jerry |last=Lembcke |title=Still a Force for Peace |url=http://www.vvaw.org/veteran/article/?id=378 |date=Fall 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; VVAW was considered by some (including the administration of President [[Richard Nixon]]) to be an effective, if controversial, component of the antiwar movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Brian |last=Williams |authorlink=Brian Williams |title=Nixon targeted Kerry for anti-war views |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4534274/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kerry participated in the "[[Winter Soldier Investigation]]" conducted by VVAW of U.S. atrocities in Vietnam, and he appears in a film by that name that documents the investigation.&lt;ref&gt;''The Washington Post'', December 9, 2005, "'Winter Soldier': Cold Days in Hell," https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/08/AR2005120801996.html&lt;/ref&gt; According to Nixon Secretary of Defense [[Melvin Laird]], "I didn't approve of what he did, but I understood the protesters quite well", and he declined two requests from the Navy to court martial Reserve Lieutenant Kerry over his antiwar activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Roots of John Kerry’s secretary of state ambition lie in wake of 2004 defeat |author= |first=Tracy |last=Jan |author2=Bryan Bender |url=http://www.boston.com/politicalintelligence/2012/12/21/roots-john-kerry-secretary-state-ambition-lie-wake-defeat/qE3obS65phxPdk6qlOdjGP/story.html |newspaper=The Boston Globe |date=December 21, 2012 |accessdate=January 12, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121230190821/www.boston.com/politicalintelligence/2012/12/21/roots-john-kerry-secretary-state-ambition-lie-wake-defeat/qE3obS65phxPdk6qlOdjGP/story.html|archivedate=December 30, 2012 |quote=Just three months after losing his campaign to be president}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 22, 1971, Kerry appeared before a U.S. Senate committee hearing on proposals relating to ending the war. The day after this testimony, Kerry participated in a demonstration with thousands of other veterans in which he and other Vietnam War veterans threw their medals and service ribbons over a fence erected at the front steps of the [[United States Capitol]] building to dramatize their opposition to the war. Jack Smith, a [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]], read a statement explaining why the veterans were returning their military awards to the government. For more than two hours, almost 1000 angry veterans tossed their medals, ribbons, hats, jackets, and military papers over the fence. Each veteran gave his or her name, hometown, branch of service and a statement. Kerry threw some of his own decorations and awards as well as some given to him by other veterans to throw. As Kerry threw his decorations over the fence, his statement was: "I'm not doing this for any violent reasons, but for peace and justice, and to try and make this country wake up once and for all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Tom |last=Oliphant |authorlink=Tom Oliphant |title=I watched Kerry throw his war decorations |url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2004/04/27/i_watched_kerry_throw_his_war_decorations/ | work=The Boston Globe | date=April 27, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kerry was arrested on May 30, 1971, during a VVAW march to honor American [[prisoner of war|POWs]] held captive by [[North Vietnam]]. The march was planned as a multi-day event from [[Concord, Massachusetts|Concord]] to Boston, and while in [[Lexington, Massachusetts|Lexington]], participants tried to camp on the village green. At 2:30&amp;nbsp;a.m., local and state police arrested 441 demonstrators, including Kerry, for trespassing. All were given the [[Miranda Warning]] and were hauled away on school buses to spend the night at the Lexington Public Works Garage. Kerry and the other protesters later paid a $5 fine, and were released. The mass arrests caused a community backlash and ended up giving positive coverage to the VVAW.&lt;ref&gt;Unfinished Symphony: Democracy and Dissent – Documentary, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Against the Vietnam War: Writings by Activists, Mary Susannah Robbins, pp. 78–90.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lexington Minute-Man Newspaper, May 23, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early political career (1972–1985)==

===1972 congressional election===
In 1970, Kerry had considered running for Congress in the Democratic primary against hawkish Democrat [[Philip J. Philbin]] of [[Massachusetts's 3rd congressional district]], but deferred in favor of [[Robert Drinan]], a Jesuit priest and anti-war activist, who went on to defeat Philbin.&lt;ref name="citm-pt4"&gt;{{cite news |first=Brian C.|last=Mooney |title=First campaign ends in defeat |url=http://www.boston.com/globe/nation/packages/kerry/061803.shtml |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=June 18, 2003 |accessdate=April 9, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031002060303/http://www.boston.com/globe/nation/packages/kerry/061803.shtml|archivedate=October 2, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1972, Kerry's wife bought a house in [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]], with Kerry intending to run against the [[Massachusetts's 4th congressional district|4th district's]] aging thirteen-term incumbent Democrat, [[Harold Donohue]].&lt;ref name="citm-pt4"/&gt; The couple never moved in. After Republican Congressman [[F. Bradford Morse]] of the neighboring [[Massachusetts's 5th congressional district|5th district]] announced his retirement and then resignation to become [[Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations|Under-Secretary-General for Political and General Assembly Affairs]] at the [[United Nations]], the couple instead rented an apartment in [[Lowell, Massachusetts|Lowell]], so that Kerry could run to succeed him.&lt;ref name="citm-pt4"/&gt;

Including Kerry, the Democratic primary race had 10 candidates, including attorney [[Paul J. Sheehy]], State Representative Anthony R. DiFruscia, John J. Desmond and [[Robert B. Kennedy]]. Kerry ran a "very expensive, sophisticated campaign", financed by out-of-state backers and supported by many young volunteers.&lt;ref name="citm-pt4"/&gt; DiFruscia's campaign headquarters shared the same building as Kerry's. On the eve of the September 19 primary, police found Kerry's younger brother [[Cameron Kerry|Cameron]] and campaign field director Thomas J. Vallely, breaking into where the building's telephone lines were located. They were arrested and charged with "[[burglary|breaking and entering]] with the intent to commit [[grand larceny]]", but the charges were dropped a year later. At the time of the incident, DiFruscia alleged that the two were trying to disrupt his get-out-the vote efforts. Vallely and Cameron Kerry maintained that they were only checking their own telephone lines because they had received an anonymous call warning that the Kerry lines would be cut.&lt;ref name="citm-pt4"/&gt;

Despite the arrests, Kerry won the primary with 20,771 votes (27.56%). Sheehy came second with 15,641 votes (20.75%), followed by DiFruscia with 12,222 votes (16.22%), Desmond with 10,213 votes (13.55%) and Kennedy with 5,632 votes (7.47%). The remaining 10,891 votes were split amongst the other five candidates, with 1970 nominee Richard Williams coming last with just 1,706 votes (2.26%).&lt;ref name="citm-pt4"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=382445|title=MA District 5 - D Primary 1972|publisher=Our Campaigns|accessdate=April 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the general election, Kerry was initially favored to defeat the Republican candidate, former State Representative [[Paul W. Cronin]], and conservative Democrat Roger P. Durkin, who ran as an Independent. A week after the primary, one poll put Kerry 26-points ahead of Cronin.&lt;ref name="citm-pt4"/&gt; His campaign called for a national health insurance system, discounted prescription drugs for the unemployed, a jobs program to clean up the [[Merrimack River]] and rent controls in Lowell and [[Lawrence, Massachusetts|Lawrence]]. A major obstacle, however, was the district's leading newspaper, the [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] ''[[The Sun (Lowell)|The Sun]]''. The paper editorialized against him. It also ran critical news stories about his out-of-state contributions and his "[[carpetbagger|carpetbagging]]", because he had only moved into the district in April. Subsequently, released "Watergate" Oval Office tape recordings of the Nixon White House showed that defeating Kerry's candidacy had attracted the personal attention of President Nixon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/24/politics/campaign/echoes-of-a-1972-loss-haunt-a-2004-campaign.html|title=Echoes of a 1972 Loss Haunt a 2004 Campaign|author=Todd Purdum|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=September 24, 2004|accessdate=April 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kerry himself asserts that Nixon sent operatives to Lowell to help derail his campaign.&lt;ref name="citm-pt4"/&gt;

The race was the most expensive for Congress in the country that year&lt;ref name="citm-pt4"/&gt; and four days before the general election, Durkin withdrew and endorsed Cronin, hoping to see Kerry defeated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Associated Press |date=November 6, 1972 |title=Durkin Pulls Out of Race in Effort to Defeat Kerry |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2209&amp;dat=19721106&amp;id=TZwrAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=DvwFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5949,837728&amp;hl=en |newspaper=Nashua Telegraph |location=Nashua, NH |page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The week before, a poll had put Kerry 10 points ahead of Cronin, with Dukin on 13%.&lt;ref name="citm-pt4"/&gt; In the final days of the campaign, Kerry sensed that it was "slipping away" and Cronin emerged victorious by 110,970 votes (53.45%) to Kerry's 92,847 (44.72%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=54220&amp;ShowAllMUPoll=Y |title=MA District 5 1972|publisher=Our Campaigns |accessdate=April 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his defeat, Kerry lamented in a letter to supporters that "for two solid weeks, [''The Sun''] called me un-American, New Left antiwar agitator, unpatriotic, and labeled me every other 'un-' and 'anti-' that they could find. It's hard to believe that one newspaper could be so powerful, but they were."&lt;ref name="citm-pt4"/&gt; He later felt that his failure to respond directly to ''The Sun''{{'}}s attacks cost him the race.&lt;ref name="citm-pt4"/&gt;

In January 1977, Droney promoted him to First Assistant District Attorney, essentially making Kerry his campaign and media surrogate because Droney was afflicted with [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS, or [[Lou Gehrig]]'s Disease). As First Assistant, Kerry tried cases, which included winning convictions in a high-profile rape case and a murder. He also played a role in administering the office, including initiating the creation of special white-collar and organized crime units, creating programs to address the problems of rape and other crime victims and witnesses, and managing trial calendars to reflect case priorities.&lt;ref name=ktrials&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2004/05/10/kerrys-trials|title=Kerry's Trials: What the Candidate Learned as a Lawyer|publisher=The New Yorker|author=Jeffrey Toobin|date=May 10, 2004|accessdate=April 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was in this role in 1978 that Kerry announced an investigation into possible criminal charges against then Senator [[Edward Brooke]], regarding "misstatements" in his first divorce trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/globe/nation/packages/kerry/images/day5/01.htm |title=/ Photo gallery |publisher=Boston.com |date=June 16, 1978 |accessdate=March 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inquiry ended with no charges being brought after investigators and prosecutors determined that Brooke's misstatements were pertinent to the case, but were not material enough to have affected the outcome.&lt;ref&gt;United Press International, Galveston Daily News, [https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/16988434/ Sen.

Droney's health was poor and Kerry had decided to run for his position in the 1978 election should Droney drop out. However, Droney was re-elected and his health improved; he went on to re-assume many of the duties that he had delegated to Kerry.&lt;ref name="citm-pt4"/&gt; Kerry thus decided to leave, departing in 1979 with assistant DA Roanne Sragow to set up their own law firm.&lt;ref name="citm-pt4"/&gt;&lt;ref name=ktrials/&gt; Kerry also worked as a commentator for [[WCVB-TV]] and co-founded a bakery, Kilvert &amp; Forbes Ltd., with businessman and former [[Kennedy family|Kennedy]] aide K.

===Iran–Contra hearings===
{{Main|Kerry Committee report}}
On April 18, 1985, a few months after taking his Senate seat, Kerry and Senator [[Tom Harkin]] of [[Iowa]] traveled to [[Nicaragua]] and met the country's president, [[Daniel Ortega]]. Though Ortega had won internationally certified elections, the trip was criticized because Ortega and his [[leftist]] [[Sandinista]] government had strong ties to [[Cuba]] and the [[USSR]] and were accused of human rights abuses. The Sandinista government was opposed by the [[right-wing]] [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]-backed rebels known as the [[Contra (guerrillas)|Contras]]. While in Nicaragua, Kerry and Harkin talked to people on both sides of the conflict. Through the senators, Ortega offered a cease-fire agreement in exchange for the U.S. dropping support of the Contras. The offer was denounced by the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] administration as a "[[propaganda]] initiative" designed to influence a House vote on a $14 million Contra [[foreign aid|aid package]], but Kerry said "I am willing..... to take the risk in the effort to put to test the good faith of the Sandinistas." The House voted down the Contra aid, but Ortega flew to Moscow to accept a $200 million loan the next day, which in part prompted the House to pass a larger $27 million aid package six weeks later.&lt;ref name="citm-pt6"&gt;{{cite news |first=John Aloysius |last=Farrell |title=With probes, making his mark |url=http://www.boston.com/globe/nation/packages/kerry/062003.shtml |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=June 20, 2003|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030621071459/http://www.boston.com/globe/nation/packages/kerry/062003.shtml|archivedate=June 21, 2003 |accessdate=July 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:JohnKerry.jpg|thumb|A Senate portrait of Kerry]]
Meanwhile, Kerry's staff began their own investigations and, on October 14, issued a report that exposed illegal activities on the part of [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Oliver North]], who had set up a private network involving the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] and the CIA to deliver military equipment to right-wing Nicaraguan rebels (Contras). In effect, North and certain members of the President's administration were accused by Kerry's report of illegally funding and supplying armed militants without the authorization of Congress. Kerry's staff investigation, based on a year-long inquiry and interviews with fifty unnamed sources, is said to raise "serious questions about whether the United States has abided by the law in its handling of the contras over the past three years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=October 15, 1986 |title=White House Official Linked To Arms Deliveries to Contras |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |page=6 |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE3D71339F936A25753C1A960948260&amp;n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fPeople%2fK%2fKerry%2c%20John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Kerry Committee report]] found that "the Contra drug links included..... payments to drug traffickers by the U.S. State Department of funds authorized by the Congress for humanitarian assistance to the Contras, in some cases after the traffickers had been indicted by federal law enforcement agencies on drug charges, in others while traffickers were under active investigation by these same agencies."&lt;ref name="report"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pinknoiz.com/covert/contracoke.html |title=Selections from the Senate Committee Report on Drugs, Law Enforcement and Foreign Policy chaired by Senator John F.

The Kerry report was a precursor to the [[Iran–Contra affair]]. On May 4, 1989, North was convicted of charges relating to the Iran/Contra controversy, including three felonies. On September 16, 1991, however, North's convictions were overturned on appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=David |last=Johnston |date=December 24, 1992 |title=Bush Pardons 6 In Iran Affair, Aborting A Weinberger Trial; Prosecutor Assails 'Cover-Up' Bush Diary at Issue 6-Year Inquiry Into Deal of Arms for Hostages All but Swept Away |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/991224onthisday_big.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===George H. W. Bush administration===
On November 15, 1988, at a businessmen's breakfast in [[Lynn, Massachusetts|East Lynn]], Massachusetts, Kerry made a joke about then-[[President-elect of the United States|President-elect]] [[George H. W. Bush]] and his running mate, saying "if Bush is shot, the [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] has orders to shoot [[Dan Quayle]]." He apologized the following day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SL&amp;p_theme=sl&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB32978E9020931&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date |title=Senator repudiates 'Shoot Quayle' joke |publisher= St. Louis Post-Dispatch Archives/AP via Nl.newsbank.com |date=November 17, 1988 |accessdate=March 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During their investigation of Noriega, Kerry's staff found reason to believe that the [[Pakistan]]-based [[Bank of Credit and Commerce International]] (BCCI) had facilitated Noriega's drug trafficking and [[money laundering]]. This led to a separate inquiry into BCCI, and as a result, banking regulators shut down BCCI in 1991. In December 1992, Kerry and Senator [[Hank Brown]], a Republican from Colorado, released ''The BCCI Affair'', a report on the BCCI scandal. The report showed that the bank was crooked and was working with [[terrorism|terrorists]], including [[Abu Nidal]]. It blasted the [[U.S. Department of Justice|Department of Justice]], the [[U.S. Department of the Treasury|Department of the Treasury]], the [[United States Customs Service|Customs Service]], the [[Federal Reserve System|Federal Reserve Bank]], as well as influential [[lobbying|lobbyists]] and the CIA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2004/0409.sirota.html |title=Follow the Money |last=Sirota |first=David |author2=Baskin, Jonathan |date=September 2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040911081424/http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2004/0409.sirota.html |archivedate=September 11, 2004 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kerry was criticized by some Democrats for having pursued his own party members, including former [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] [[Clark Clifford]], although Republicans said he should have pressed against some Democrats even harder. The BCCI scandal was later turned over to the [[New York County District Attorney|Manhattan District Attorney]]'s office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/irp/congress/1992_rpt/bcci/19rogers.htm |title=The BCCI Affair – 19 Ed Rogers and Kamal Adham|publisher=Fas.org |date= |accessdate=March 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Precursors to presidential bid===
{{See also|Massachusetts United States Senate election, 1996|United States presidential election, 2000}}
In 1996, Kerry faced a difficult re-election fight against Governor [[William Weld]], a popular Republican incumbent who had been re-elected in 1994 with 71% of the vote. The race was covered nationwide as one of the most closely watched Senate races that year. Kerry and Weld held several debates and negotiated a campaign spending cap of $6.9 million at Kerry's [[Beacon Hill, Boston, Massachusetts|Beacon Hill]] townhouse. Both candidates spent more than the cap, with each camp accusing the other of being first to break the agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rimer |first=Sara |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C02E5D91130F936A15753C1A960958260 |title=Promises Yield to Old-Fashioned Politics |publisher=''The New York Times'' |date=October 25, 1996 |accessdate=March 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the campaign, Kerry spoke briefly at the [[1996 Democratic National Convention]].

==="You get stuck in Iraq" controversy===
On October 30, 2006, Kerry was a headline speaker at a campaign rally being held for Democratic [[California gubernatorial election, 2006|California gubernatorial candidate]] [[Phil Angelides]] at [[Pasadena City College]] in [[Pasadena, California]]. Speaking to an audience composed mainly of college students, Kerry said, "You know, education, if you make the most of it, you study hard, you do your homework and you make an effort to be smart, you can do well. If you don't, you get stuck in Iraq."&lt;ref name=botched&gt;{{cite news |last=Ryan |first=Andrew |title=Kerry says he "botched joke" and lashes out at GOP |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |date =October 31, 2006 |url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/city_region/breaking_news/2006/10/kerry_says_he_b.html |accessdate=January 11, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061119132504/http://www.boston.com:80/news/globe/city_region/breaking_news/2006/10/kerry_says_he_b.html|archivedate=November 19, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The day after the remarks were made public, leaders from both sides of the political spectrum criticized Kerry's remarks, which he said were a botched joke. Republicans including President George W. Bush, Senator [[John McCain]] and then-Speaker of the House [[Dennis Hastert]], said that Kerry's comments were insulting to American military forces fighting in Iraq. Democratic Representative [[Harold Ford, Jr.]] called on Kerry to apologize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Runningen|first=Roger| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aSkiYG2_QwvM | title =Kerry Events Cut as Democrats Criticize Iraq Remark  | publisher =Bloomberg News| date =November 1, 2006 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402194319/https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aSkiYG2_QwvM|archivedate=April 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Kerry's prepared remarks, which he released during the ensuing media frenzy, the corresponding line was "... you end up getting us stuck in a war in Iraq. Just ask President Bush." He also said that from the context of the speech which, prior to the "stuck in Iraq" line, made several specific references to Bush and elements of his biography, that Kerry was referring to President Bush and not American troops in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

A ''Washington Post'' report in May 2011 stated that Kerry "has emerged in the past few years as an important envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan during times of crisis," as he undertook another trip to the two countries. The killing of [[Osama bin Laden]] "has generated perhaps the most important crossroads yet," the report continued, as the senator spoke at a press conference and prepared to fly from [[Kabul]] to Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Partlow|first=Joshua|title=Kerry: U.S. relationship with Pakistan at 'critical moment'|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/kerry-us-relationship-with-pakistan-at-critical-moment/2011/05/15/AFnx4D4G_story.html?hpid=z3|publisher=''The Washington Post''|accessdate=May 15, 2011|date=May 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among matters discussed during the May visit to Pakistan, under the general rubric of "recalibrating" the bilateral relationship, Kerry sought and retrieved from the Pakistanis the tail-section of the [[Death of Osama bin Laden#"Stealth helicopter" revealed, retrieved|U.S. helicopter]] which had had to be abandoned at [[Abbottabad]] during the bin Laden strike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brulliard|first=Karin|title=Pakistan to return U.S. helicopter tail, Kerry says|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/sen-john-kerry-arrives-in-pakistan-for-meetings-that-could-sway-future-us-aid-prospects/2011/05/16/AFJJIZ4G_story.html|publisher=''The Washington Post''|accessdate=May 17, 2011|date=May 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Kerry met with Pakistan's army chief [[Ashfaq Parvez Kayani|Gen.

===Voting record===

====Overall====
Most analyses place Kerry's voting record on the left within the Senate Democratic caucus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.factcheck.org/how_liberal_is_john_kerry.html How Liberal is John Kerry?] FactCheck.org. Retrieved January 28, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 2004 presidential election he was portrayed as a staunch [[Liberalism in the United States|liberal]] by conservative groups and the Bush campaign, who often noted that in 2003 Kerry was rated the ''[[National Journal]]'''s top Senate liberal. However, that rating was based only upon voting on legislation within that past year. In fact, in terms of career voting records, the ''National Journal'' found that Kerry is the 11th most liberal member of the Senate. Most analyses find that Kerry is at least slightly more liberal than the typical Democratic Senator. Kerry has stated that he opposes privatizing [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]], supports [[abortion]] rights for adult women and minors, supports [[same-sex marriage]], opposes [[capital punishment]] except for [[terrorists]], supports most [[Gun politics in the United States#Gun control laws|gun control laws]], and is generally a supporter of trade agreements. Kerry supported the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] and [[Most Favored Nation]] status for China, but opposed the [[Central American Free Trade Agreement]].{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

In July 1997 Kerry joined his Senate colleagues in voting against ratification of the [[Kyoto Treaty]] on [[global warming]] without greenhouse gas emissions limits on nations deemed developing, including India and China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=105&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00205 |title=U.S. Senate: Legislation &amp; Records Home &gt; Votes &gt; Roll Call Vote |publisher=Senate.gov |date= |accessdate=March 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, Kerry has attacked President Bush, charging him with opposition to international efforts to combat global warming.&lt;ref name="pariah"&gt;{{cite news |title=Kerry says U.S. 'a sort of international pariah' |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2007-01-27-kerry-us-policy_x.htm?csp=34 |work= |publisher=[[USA TODAY]] |date=January 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 1, 2008, Kerry voted for [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008]], also known as the [[Troubled Asset Relief Program|TARP]] bailout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=110&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00212 |title=U.S. Senate: Legislation &amp; Records Home &gt; Votes &gt; Roll Call Vote |publisher=Senate.gov |date= |accessdate=March 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Iraq====
In the lead up to the [[Iraq War]], Kerry said on October 9, 2002; "I will be voting to give the President of the United States the authority to use force, if necessary, to disarm Saddam Hussein because I believe that a deadly arsenal of weapons of mass destruction in his hands is a real and grave threat to our security." Bush relied on that resolution in ordering the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]]. Kerry also gave a January 23, 2003 speech to [[Georgetown University]] saying "Without question, we need to disarm Saddam Hussein. He is a brutal, murderous dictator; leading an oppressive regime he presents a particularly grievous threat because he is so consistently prone to miscalculation. So the threat of Saddam Hussein with weapons of mass destruction is real." Kerry did, however, warn that the administration should exhaust its diplomatic avenues before launching war: "Mr. President, do not rush to war, take the time to build the coalition, because it's not winning the war that's hard, it's winning the peace that's hard."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kerry Makes It Official |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/09/02/politics/main571162.shtml |publisher=[[CBS]] |date=September 2, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the invasion of Iraq, when no [[weapons of mass destruction]] were found, Kerry strongly criticized Bush, contending that he had misled the country: "When the President of the United States looks at you and tells you something, there should be some trust."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bush defends Iraq war in face of WMD findings |url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/US/01/27/sprj.nirq.bush/ |publisher=CNN |date=January 28, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Libya====
In 2011, Kerry supported American military action in Libya.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-libya-usa-kerry/kerry-warns-u-s-against-failing-to-act-on-libya-idUSTRE72F98D20110316&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/libya/8723533/Libya-Col-Gaddafi-feared-full-US-invasion.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leadership===
Kerry chaired the [[Senate Select Committee on POW/MIA Affairs]] from 1991 to 1993. The committee's report, which Kerry endorsed, stated there was "no compelling evidence that proves that any American remains alive in captivity in Southeast Asia."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://fas.org/irp/congress/1993_rpt/pow-exec.html |title=Report of the Select Committee on POW/MIA Affairs |publisher=[[U.S. Senate]] |date=January 13, 1993 |accessdate=January 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994 the Senate passed a resolution, sponsored by Kerry and fellow Vietnam veteran [[John McCain]], that called for an end to the existing trade embargo against Vietnam; it was intended to pave the way for normalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A02E3DC1639F93BA15752C0A962958260 |title=Senate Urges End to U.S. Embargo Against Vietnam |author=Greenhouse, Steven |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=January 28, 1994 |accessdate=January 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, President [[Bill Clinton]] normalized diplomatic relations with the country of Vietnam.&lt;ref name="time072495"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,983202,00.html |title=Good Morning, Vietnam |author=Walsh, James |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=July 24, 1995 |accessdate=January 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kerry was the chairman of the [[Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee]] from 1987 to 1989. He was reelected to the Senate in [[United States Senate election, 1990|1990]], [[United States Senate election, 1996|1996]] (after winning re-election against the then-[[List of Governors of Massachusetts|Governor of Massachusetts]] Republican [[William Weld]]), [[United States Senate election, 2002|2002]], and [[United States Senate election, 2008|2008]]. In January 2009, Kerry replaced [[Joe Biden]] as the chairman of the [[Senate Foreign Relations Committee]].&lt;ref name="boston.com"&gt;{{cite news| url = http://archive.boston.com/news/politics/2008/articles/2008/11/20/kerry_poised_to_cap_long_journey/?page=full| title = Kerry poised to cap long journey| author = Bryan Bender| date = November 20, 2008| newspaper = [[The Boston Globe]]|accessdate=July 7, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121110205728/http://www.boston.com/news/politics/2008/articles/2008/11/20/kerry_poised_to_cap_long_journey/?page=full|archivedate=November 10, 2012|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a role model for campus leaders across the nation and strong advocate for global development, Kerry was honored by the Millennium Campus Network (MCN) as a [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO33By_msYw Global Generation Award winner] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/lifestyle/blogs/thenextgreatgeneration/2011/09/global_generation_awards_honor.html |title=Global Generation Awards Honor Gen Y's Humanitarian Heroes - The Next Great Generation |publisher=Boston.com |date= September 19, 2011|accessdate=April 22, 2013 |first=Alex |last=Pearlman}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/celebrity/articles/2011/09/20/dushku_honored_at_global_generation_awards/ |title=Dushku honored at Global Generation Awards |publisher=Boston.com |date=September 20, 2011 |accessdate=April 22, 2013 |first1=Mark |last1=Shanahan |first2=Meredith |last2=Goldstein}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Seniority===
{{Main|Seniority in the United States Senate}}
From the beginning of the [[113th United States Congress]] until his resignation, Kerry ranked as the 7th most senior U.S. Senator. Due to the [[longevity]] of Ted Kennedy's service, Kerry was the most senior ''junior Senator'' in the [[List of United States Senators in the 111th Congress by seniority|111th United States Congress]]. On Tuesday, August 25, 2009, Kerry became the senior senator from Massachusetts following Ted Kennedy's death.

==2004 presidential campaign==
{{Main|United States presidential election, 2004|John Kerry presidential campaign, 2004|2004 United States presidential election controversy and irregularities}}

[[File:Kerry, baby, horizontal.jpg|thumb|Kerry on the campaign trail in [[Rochester, Minnesota]]]]
In the 2004 Democratic [[United States presidential primary|presidential primaries]], John Kerry defeated several Democratic rivals, including Sen. [[John Edwards]] (D-North Carolina.), former Vermont Governor [[Howard Dean]] and retired [[United States Army|Army]] General [[Wesley Clark]]. His victory in the Iowa caucuses is widely believed to be the tipping point where Kerry revived his sagging campaign in New Hampshire and the February 3, 2004, primary states like Arizona, South Carolina and New Mexico. Kerry then went on to win landslide victories in Nevada and Wisconsin. Kerry thus won the Democratic nomination to run for President of the United States against incumbent George W. Bush. On July 6, 2004, he announced his selection of [[John Edwards]] as his running mate. Democratic strategist [[Bob Shrum]], who was Kerry's 2004 campaign adviser, wrote an article in [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] claiming that after the election, Kerry had said that he wished he had never picked Edwards, and that the two have since stopped speaking to each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shrum |first=Robert |url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1626498-2,00.html |title=Kerry's Regrets About John Edwards |publisher=Time.com |date=May 30, 2007 |accessdate=March 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a subsequent appearance on ABC's ''This Week'', Kerry refused to respond to Shrum's allegation, calling it a "ridiculous waste of time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/01/13/kerry-disregards-bob-shru_n_81260.html |title=Kerry Disregards Bob Shrum Book: "Ridiculous Waste Of Time" |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date= January 13, 2008|accessdate=March 12, 2010 |first=Nico |last=Pitney}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his bid to be elected president in [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004]], Kerry frequently criticized President [[George W. Bush]] for starting the [[Iraq War]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbcnews.com/id/5552784/#.UU4rEpGZwg9 "Text of Kerry's Acceptance Speech,"], [[NBC News]], July 29, 2004. "Saying there are weapons of mass destruction in Iraq doesn't make it so. Saying we can fight a war on the cheap doesn't make it so. And proclaiming mission accomplished certainly doesn't make it so."&lt;/ref&gt; While Kerry had initially voted in support of authorizing President Bush to use force in dealing with Saddam Hussein, he voted against an $87 billion supplemental appropriations bill to pay for the subsequent war. His statement on March 16, 2004, "I actually did vote for the $87 billion before I voted against it," helped the Bush campaign to paint him as a flip-flopper and has been cited as contributing to Kerry's defeat.&lt;ref name="baroneandcohen"&gt;{{cite book|first=Michael|last=Barone|first2=Richard E.|last2=Cohen |title = The Almanac of American Politics 2010|location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=National Journal Group|year = 2009|page = 731|isbn = 978-0-89234-120-7|authorlink=Michael Barone (pundit)|quote = Bush's job approval hovered under 50%, and he trailed Kerry in polls for much of the seven-month campaign. Kerry performed well in debates, being judged the winner in snap polls in all three. Yet he lost. One reason may have been encapsulated by his March 16 defense of his 2003 vote against the supplemental appropriation for Iraq: 'I actually did vote for the $87 billion before I voted against it.' The Bush campaign painted Kerry as a flip-flopper.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 3, 2004, Kerry conceded the race. Kerry won 59.03 million votes, or 48.3 percent of the popular vote; Bush won 62.04 million votes, or 50.7 percent of the popular vote. Kerry carried states with a total of 252 [[United States Electoral College|electoral votes]]. One Kerry elector voted for Kerry's running mate, Edwards, so in the final tally Kerry had 251 electoral votes to Bush's 286.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fec.gov/pubrec/fe2004/federalelections2004.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later presidential election activities==
[[File:John Kerry DNC 2008.jpg|thumb|Kerry speaking during the third night of the [[2008 Democratic National Convention]] in [[Denver]], [[Colorado]]]]
Immediately after the 2004 election, some Democrats mentioned Kerry as a possible contender for the 2008 Democratic nomination. His brother had said such a campaign was "conceivable", and Kerry himself reportedly said at a farewell party for his 2004 campaign staff, "There's always another four years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Glen |last=Johnson |title=Kerry run in '08 called conceivable |url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2004/11/09/kerry_run_in_08_called_conceivable/|work=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=November 9, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kerry established a separate [[political action committee]], Keeping America's Promise, which declared as its mandate "A Democratic Congress will restore accountability to Washington and help change a disastrous course in Iraq",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.keepingamericaspromise.com/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061116051342/http://www.keepingamericaspromise.com/ |archivedate=November 16, 2006 |title=Keeping America's Promise |publisher=Keepingamericaspromise.com |date=July 5, 2007 |accessdate=March 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and raised money and channeled contributions to Democratic candidates in state and federal races.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Glen |last=Johnson |title=Kerry creates PAC to back candidates |url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2004/12/05/kerry_creates_pac_to_back_candidates/ |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=December 5, 2004|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050128194628/http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2004/12/05/kerry_creates_pac_to_back_candidates/|archivedate=January 28, 2005|accessdate=July 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through Keeping America's Promise in 2005, Kerry raised over $5.5 million for other Democrats up and down the ballot. Through his campaign account and his political action committee, the Kerry campaign operation generated more than $10 million for various party committees and 179 candidates for the U.S. House, Senate, state and local offices in 42 states focusing on the midterm elections during the 2006 election cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Brain C. |last=Mooney |title=Kerry's barnstorming sparks talk of a run |url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2006/10/09/kerrys_barnstorming_sparks_talk_of_a_run/ |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=October 9, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724211845/http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2006/10/09/kerrys_barnstorming_sparks_talk_of_a_run/|archivedate=July 24, 2008|accessdate=July 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Cumulatively, John Kerry has done as much if not more than any other individual senator", Hassan Nemazee, the national finance chairman of the [[Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee|DSCC]] said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Rick |last=Klein |author2=Kranish, Michael |title=Kerry is pressured to share campaign wealth |url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2006/10/21/kerry_is_pressured_to_share_campaign_wealth/|work=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=October 21, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207093333/http://www.boston.com:80/news/nation/articles/2006/10/21/kerry_is_pressured_to_share_campaign_wealth/?page=2|archivedate=December 7, 2008|accessdate=July 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 10, 2008, Kerry endorsed Illinois Senator [[Barack Obama]] for president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/01/10/kerry.obama/index.html |title=Kerry endorses Obama over '04 running mate |publisher=CNN.com |date=January 10, 2008 |accessdate=March 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was mentioned as a possible vice presidential candidate for Senator Obama, although fellow Senator [[Joe Biden]] was eventually chosen.

After six months of rigorous diplomacy within the [[Middle East]], Secretary Kerry was able to have [[Israel]]i and [[State of Palestine|Palestinian]] negotiators agree to start the [[2013–14 Israeli–Palestinian peace talks]].

On September 27, 2013, he met with the [[Iran]]ian [[Foreign Affairs Minister of Iran|Foreign Minister]] [[Mohammad Javad Zarif]] during the [[P5+1]] and Iran summit, which eventually led to the [[Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action|JCPOA]] nuclear agreement.

In the State Department, Kerry quickly earned a reputation "for being aloof, keeping to himself, and not bothering to read staff memos." Career State Department officials have complained that power has become too centralized under Kerry's leadership, which slows department operations when Kerry is on one of his frequent overseas trips. Others in State describe Kerry as having "a kind of diplomatic attention deficit disorder" as he shifts from topic to topic instead of focusing on long-term strategy. When asked whether he was traveling too much, he responded, "Hell no. I'm not slowing down." Despite Kerry's early achievements, morale at State is lower than under Hillary Clinton according to department employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rohde|first=David|date=November 20, 2013|title=How John Kerry Could End Up Outdoing Hillary Clinton|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2013/12/john-kerry-will-not-be-denied/354688/|newspaper=The Atlantic}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after Kerry's first six months in the State Department, a Gallup poll found he had high approval ratings among Americans as Secretary of State.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Arkin|first=James|date=September 16, 2013|title=Poll: John Kerry's approval tops President Obama's|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2013/09/john-kerry-approval-rating-poll-96842.html|newspaper=Politico}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a year, another poll showed Kerry's favorability continued to rise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Swift|first=Art|date=March 5, 2014|title=Secretary of State Kerry's Favorability Rising in the U.S.|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/167741/secretary-state-kerry-favorability-rising.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; Less than two years into Kerry's term, the Foreign Policy Magazine's 2014 Ivory Tower survey of international relations scholars asked, "Who was the most effective U.S. Secretary of State in the past 50 years?"; John Kerry and [[Lawrence Eagleburger]] tied for 11th place out of the 15 confirmed Secretaries of State in that period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kamen|first=Al|date=February 5, 2015|title=Scholars votes put Kerry dead last in terms of effectiveness|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/in-the-loop/wp/2015/02/05/scholars-rank-kerry-dead-last-in-terms-of-effectiveness/|newspaper=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Maliniak|first=Daniel|date=February 5, 2015|title=The Best International Relations Schools in the World|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/02/03/top-twenty-five-schools-international-relations/|newspaper=Foreign Policy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2014, having met with Secretary of State, [[Archbishop]] [[Pietro Parolin]], Kerry said "We touched on just about every major issue that we are both working on, that are issues of concern to all of us. First of all, we talked at great length about Syria, and I was particularly appreciative for the Archbishop's raising this issue, and equally grateful for the Holy Father's comments – the Pope's comments yesterday regarding his support for the Geneva II process. We welcome that support. It is very important to have broad support, and I know that the Pope is particularly concerned about the massive numbers of displaced human beings and the violence that has taken over 130,000 lives".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.state.gov/md219654.htm|title=Remarks After Meeting With Secretary of State of the Holy See Pietro Parolin|work=state.gov|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203112534/http://m.state.gov/md219654.htm|archivedate=February 3, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kerry expressed support for Israel's right to defend itself during the [[2014 Israel–Gaza conflict]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/after-airstrikes-kill-dozens-in-gaza-kerry-backs-israels-right-to-defend-itself/ |title=After airstrikes kill dozens in Gaza, Kerry backs Israel's right to defend itself |date=July 20, 2014 |work=The Times of Israel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kerry said the United States supported the [[Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen]] because [[Saudi Arabia]], an ally, was threatened "very directly" by the takeover of neighboring Yemen by the [[Houthis]], but noted that the United States would not reflexively support Saudi Arabia's proxy wars against Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/14/world/middleeast/yemen-saudi-us.html?_r=0 |title=Quiet Support for Saudis Entangles U.S. in Yemen |work=The New York Times |date=March 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 28, 2016, soon after [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334]] passed 14-0 with the U.S. abstaining, Kerry joined the rest of the [[United Nations Security Council|U.N. Security Council]] in strongly criticizing Israel's [[Israeli settlement|settlement policies]] in a speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1=Sanger | first1=David E. | title=Kerry Rebukes Israel, Calling Settlements a Threat to Peace | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/28/us/politics/john-kerry-israel-palestine-peace.html?_r=0 | date=December 28, 2016 | publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' | accessdate=January 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His speech and criticisms met negative reactions from Israeli Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Israel-Palestinians: Netanyahu Condemns John Kerry Speech | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-38455753 | date=December 29, 2016 | publisher=[[BBC]] | accessdate=January 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; while UK Prime Minister [[Theresa May]] distanced the UK from Kerry's strongly worded speech in what appeared to be an attempt to build bridges with the incoming Trump administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1=Stewart | first1=Heather | title=Theresa May's Criticism of John Kerry Israel Speech Sparks Blunt US Reply | url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/dec/29/theresa-may-john-kerry-comments-israel-palestine-un-resolution | date=December 29, 2016 | publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' | accessdate=January 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kerry's speech received positive reactions from Arab nations, but some criticized his remarks as too little, too late from the outgoing administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1=Hubbard | first1=Ben | title=Praise for Kerry's Israel Speech in Arab World, but Shrugs, Too | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/29/world/middleeast/john-kerry-israel-speech-arabs.html | date=December 29, 2016 | publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' | accessdate=January 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Syria===
Following the August 21, 2013, [[Ghouta chemical attack|chemical weapons attack on the Ghouta suburbs of Damascus]] attributed to Syrian government forces, Kerry became a leading advocate for the use of military force against the Syrian government for what he called "a despot's brutal and flagrant use of chemical weapons."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=August 30, 2013 |title=Kerry Becomes Chief Advocate for U.S. Attack |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/31/world/middleeast/john-kerry-syria.html?_r=0&amp;pagewanted=all |newspaper=The New York Times |first1=Peter |last1=Baker |first2=Michael R. |last2=Gordon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kerry said on September 9 in response to a reporter's question about whether Syrian President [[Bashar al-Assad]] could avert a military strike: "He could turn over every single bit of his chemical weapons to the international community in the next week. Turn it over, all of it, without delay, and allow a full and total accounting for that. But he isn't about to do it, and it can't be done, obviously." This unscripted remark initiated a process that would lead to Syria agreeing to relinquish and destroy its chemical weapons arsenal, as Russia treated Kerry's statement as a serious proposal. Russian Foreign Minister [[Sergey Lavrov]] said Russia would work "immediately" to convince Syria relinquish and destroy its large chemical weapons arsenal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=September 10, 2013 |title=Syria timeline: how Kerry's gaffe became a plan |url=http://www.smh.com.au/world/syria-timeline-how-kerrys-gaffe-became-a-plan-20130910-2ti4z.html |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=September 9, 2013 |title=John Kerry's Gaffe Heard Round the World |url=http://www.thewire.com/politics/2013/09/gaffe-heard-round-world/69205/ |newspaper=The Wire }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=September 9, 2013 |title=Kerry's Syria 'gaffe' gains swift traction |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5ias_Ba-6bNuttPmPTTgcVZp1BUhw?docId=CNG.57b1e73f97bfc9c11ac2f3f75999a7f9.4e1 |agency=AFP }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=September 9, 2013 |title=White House's Syria gaffe offers Obama a chance to climb back from war |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/09/white-house-syria-gaffe-obama-war |agency=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Syria quickly welcomed this proposal and on September 14, the UN formally accepted Syria's application to join the convention banning chemical weapons, and separately, the U.S. and Russia agreed on a plan to eliminate Syria's chemical weapons by the middle of 2014, leading Kerry to declare on July 20, 2014: "we struck a deal where we got 100 percent of the chemical weapons out."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.politifact.com/john-kerry-syria-archive/&lt;/ref&gt;  On September 28, the UN Security Council passed a resolution ordering the destruction of Syria's chemical weapons and condemning the August 21 Ghouta attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=October 6, 2013 |title=Timeline of events leading up to Syria chemical disarmament |url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/afp/131006/timeline-events-leading-syria-chemical-disarmament |agency=AFP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latin America===
In a speech before the [[Organization of American States]] in November 2013, Kerry remarked that the era of the [[Monroe Doctrine]] was over. He went on to explain, "The relationship that we seek and that we have worked hard to foster is not about a United States declaration about how and when it will intervene in the affairs of other American states. It's about all of our countries viewing one another as equals, sharing responsibilities, cooperating on security issues, and adhering not to doctrine, but to the decisions that we make as partners to advance the values and the interests that we share."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Keith|title=Kerry Makes It Official: 'Era of Monroe Doctrine Is Over'|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2013/11/18/kerry-makes-it-official-era-of-monroe-doctrine-is-over/|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|date=November 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmentalism===
Kerry has had a long-standing concern with environmentalism as a global issue. In April 2016, he signed the [[Paris Agreement|Paris Climate Accords]] at the United Nations in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2016/04/22/3771889/paris-agreement-signing/|title=Alongside 174 Nations And Holding His Granddaughter, John Kerry Signs Paris Climate Accord — ThinkProgress|first=|last=ThinkProgress|date=April 22, 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 11, 2016, Kerry became the first Secretary of State and highest-ranking U.S. official to date to visit [[Antarctica]]. Kerry spent two days on the continent meeting with researchers and staying overnight at [[McMurdo Station]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/john-kerry-lands-antarctica-highest-us-official-visit-43458138|title=John Kerry Lands in Antarctica, Highest US Official to Visit|date=November 11, 2016|publisher=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, Kerry led opposition to continued funding for the [[Integral Fast Reactor]], which resulting in the end of funding for the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesciencecouncil.com/pdfs/PlentifulEnergy.pdf|title=Plentiful Energy: The Story of the Integral Fast Reactor|author=Charles E. Till &amp; Yoon Il Chang|date=2011|publisher=Self-published}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in light of increasing concerns regarding climate change, in 2017 Kerry reversed his position on nuclear power, saying "Given this challenge we face today, and given the progress of fourth generation nuclear: go for it. No other alternative, zero emissions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wbur.org/bostonomix/2017/01/09/john-kerry-mit-climate-change|title=Speaking At MIT, Secretary Of State John Kerry Urges Action On Climate Change|first=Bruce|last=Gellerman|date=January 9, 2017|accessdate=January 11, 2017|publisher=WBUR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Global Connect initiative===
In September 2015, the U.S. Department of State unveiled a new initiative called "Global Connect" which seeks to provide internet access to over 1.5 billion people around the world who do not have online connectivity by year 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2015/09/247374.htm|title=U.S. State Department Launches Global Connect Initiatives at UNGA|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, in partnership with [[Overseas Private Investment Corporation|OPIC]], Kerry announced an investment of $171 million to enable "a low-cost and rapidly scalable wireless broadband network in India".

==Post-Obama Administration==
Kerry retired from his diplomatic work following the end of the Obama administration on January 20, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[https://history.state.gov/departmenthistory/people/kerry-john-forbes John Kerry CV at State Department website]&lt;/ref&gt; He did not attend [[inauguration of Donald Trump|Donald Trump's inauguration]] on that day, and the following day took part in the [[2017 Women's March]] in Washington D.C.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/john-kerry-shows-up-at-womens-march-withhis-dog/article/2612580 John Kerry shows up at Women's March with his dog, ''Washington Examiner'', January 21, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;
Kerry has taken a strong stand against Trump policies and joined in filing a [[brief (law)#United States|brief]] arguing against the new president's executive order [[Executive Order 13769|banning entry of persons from seven Muslim countries]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.yahoo.com/news/kerry-albright-urge-court-uphold-block-trump-travel-111059791.html "Kerry, Albright urge court to uphold block on Trump travel ban"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal and family life==

===Ancestry===
Kerry's paternal grandparents, shoe businessman Frederick A. "Fred" Kerry and musician Ida Lowe, were immigrants from the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]].

===Marriages and children===
[[File:Secretary Kerry is Congratulated by his Family.jpg|thumb|Kerry's daughter Vanessa and grandson Alexander]]
Kerry was married to [[Julia Thorne|Julia Stimson Thorne]] in 1970, and they had two daughters together:
* [[Alexandra Kerry|Alexandra Forbes Kerry]] (born September 5, 1973), documentary filmmaker
* [[Vanessa Kerry|Vanessa Bradford Kerry]] (born December 31, 1976), physician

Alexandra was born days before Kerry began law school. In 1982, Julia asked Kerry for a separation while she was suffering from severe [[clinical depression|depression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.washingtonian.com/people/madame_ex.html |last=McLellan |first=Diana |title=Lunch with Diana McLellan – Madame Ex |work=Washingtonian |publisher=Washington Magazine Inc. |issue=July 1996 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051123094018/http://www.washingtonian.com/people/madame_ex.html |postscript=. |archivedate=November 23, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were divorced on July 25, 1988, and the marriage was formally [[annulment|annulled]] in 1997. "After 14 years as a political wife, I associated politics only with anger, fear and loneliness" she wrote in ''A Change of Heart'', her book about depression. Thorne later married Richard Charlesworth, an [[architect]], and moved to [[Bozeman, Montana]], where she became active in local environmental groups such as the [[Greater Yellowstone Coalition]]. Thorne supported Kerry's 2004 presidential run. She died of cancer on April 27, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2006/04/28/julia_thorne_author_and_ex_wife_of_sen_kerry_dead_at_61/|title=Julia Thorne, author and ex-wife of Sen. Kerry, dead at 61|work=boston.com | date=April 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kerry and his second wife, [[Portuguese Mozambique|Mozambican]]-born businesswoman and philanthropist [[Teresa Heinz]], the widow of Kerry's late Pennsylvania Republican Senate colleague [[John Heinz]], were introduced to each other by Heinz at an [[Earth Day]] rally in 1990. Early the following year, Senator Heinz was killed in a plane crash near [[Lower Merion Township, Pennsylvania|Lower Merion]]. Teresa has three sons from her previous marriage to Heinz, Henry John IV, [[André Heinz|André]], and [[Christopher Heinz|Christopher]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/nation/president/2004-05-23-heinz-kerry-cover_x.htm|title=With Teresa, expect an unconventional campaign|work=usatoday.com | first1=Jill|last1=Lawrence|date=May 26, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heinz and Kerry were married on May 26, 1995, in [[Nantucket, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://old.post-gazette.com/nation/20020605teresanat1p1.asp|title=What Teresa Heinz found and what she lost|date=|work=post-gazette.com|accessdate=August 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Forbes 400]]'' survey estimated in 2004 that Teresa Heinz Kerry had a [[net worth]] of $750 million. However, estimates have frequently varied, ranging from around $165 million to as high as $3.2 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]], according to a study in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. Regardless of which figure is correct, Kerry was the wealthiest U.S. Senator while serving in the Senate. Independent of Heinz, Kerry is wealthy in his own right, and is the beneficiary of at least four trusts inherited from [[Forbes family]] relatives, including his mother, [[Rosemary Forbes Kerry]], who died in 2002. ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine (named for the [[Forbes family (publishers)|Forbes family of publishers]], unrelated to Kerry) estimated that if elected, and if Heinz family assets were included, Kerry would have been the third-richest U.S. President in history, when adjusted for [[inflation]].&lt;ref name=Ackman102904&gt;{{cite news |first=Dan |last=Ackman |authorlink=Dan Ackman |title=Kerry Would Be Third-Richest U.S. President If Elected |url=https://www.forbes.com/2004/02/13/cx_da_0213kerry.html |work=Forbes|date=October 29, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; This assessment was based on Heinz and Kerry's combined assets, but the couple signed a [[prenuptial agreement]] that keeps their assets separate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ask.yahoo.com/ask/20040823.html |title=What is George W.

This included slightly more than three million dollars worth of [[H. J. Heinz Company]] assets, which increased in value by over six hundred thousand dollars in 2013 when [[Berkshire Hathaway]] announced their intention to purchase the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=John Kerry May Have Made $670,000 On Today's Heinz Deal |author=Julia La Roche |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/john-kerry-heinz-ketchup-2013-2 |newspaper=Business Insider |date=February 14, 2013 |accessdate=February 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious beliefs===
[[File:Secretary Kerry Tours Chinese Automotive Factory (12538003213).jpg|thumb|Kerry touring a Chinese automobile factory in [[Beijing]]]]
Kerry is a [[Roman Catholic]], and is said to have carried a religious [[rosary]], a [[prayer book]], and a [[St. Christopher]] medal (the patron saint of travelers) when he campaigned. Discussing his faith, Kerry said: "I thought of being a priest. I was very religious while at school in [[Switzerland]]. I was an altar boy and prayed all the time. I was very centered around the Mass and the church." He also said that the [[Pauline epistles|Letters of Paul]] ([[Paul the Apostle|Apostle Paul]]) moved him the most, stating that they taught him to "not feel sorry for myself."&lt;ref name=ReligionBackground/&gt;

Kerry told ''[[Christianity Today]]'' in October 2004:

{{blockquote|text=I'm a Catholic and I practice, but at the same time I have an open-mindedness to many other expressions of spirituality that come through different religions... I've spent some time reading and thinking about religion and trying to study it, and I've arrived at not so much a sense of the differences, but a sense of the similarities in so many ways.&lt;ref name="ctoday"/&gt;}}

He said that he believed that the [[Torah]], the [[Quran]], and the [[Bible]] all share a fundamental story which connects with readers.&lt;ref name="ctoday"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ctlibrary.com/ct/2004/october/20.28.html |title=John Kerry's Open Mind |last=Stricherz |first=Mark |date=October 1, 2004 |publisher=Christianity Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Athletics and sailing===
In addition to the sports he played at Yale, Kerry is described by ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', among others, as an "avid [[cycling|cyclist]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Tim |last=Maloney |title=Kerry Au Tour |url=http://autobus.cyclingnews.com/road/2005/tour05/news/?id=/news/2005/jul05/jul24news2 |date=July 24, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Politics?

Prior to his presidential bid, Kerry had participated in several long-distance [[challenge riding|rides]]. During his many campaigns, he was reported to have visited bicycle stores in both his home state and elsewhere. His staff requested recumbent stationary bikes for his hotel rooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/0327061kerry2.html |title=JK hotel needs |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100418062714/http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/0327061kerry2.html |archivedate=April 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also been a snowboarder, windsurfer, and sailor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=merron/kerry/040726|title=ESPN.com: Page 2 : Rink turns and big deals|work=go.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Boston Herald]]'' reported on July 23, 2010 that Kerry commissioned construction on a new $7 million yacht (a Friendship 75) in New Zealand and moored it in [[Portsmouth, Rhode Island]], where the Friendship yacht company is based.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.friendshipyachtcompany.com/contacts.html |title=Friendship Yacht Company |publisher=Friendship Yacht Company |date= |accessdate=August 29, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510161359/http://www.friendshipyachtcompany.com/contacts.html |archivedate=May 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The article claimed this allowed him to avoid paying Massachusetts taxes on the property including approximately $437,500 in sales tax and an annual excise tax of about $500.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fee|first=Gayle|last2=Raposa|first2=Laura|url=http://www.bostonherald.com/track/inside_track/view/20100723senator_skipper_skips_town_on_sails_tax/|title=Sen.
