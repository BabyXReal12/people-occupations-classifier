In his first run for political office, he upset 18-term [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] incumbent [[Jim Oberstar]] by a margin of 4,400 votes to become the first [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] since 1947 to represent the district.&lt;ref name="giant killer"/&gt; Previously, Cravaack was a pilot for [[Northwest Airlines]], and before that he was a [[United States Naval Aviator|Navy pilot]], and a graduate of the [[United States Naval Academy|U.S. Naval Academy]].

==Early life and education==

Cravaack was born in [[Charleston, West Virginia]] on January 29, 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Official Congressional Directory : 112th Congress.|date=2011|publisher=United States Government Printing Office|location=Washington, D. C.|isbn=9780160886539|page=146|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fVSkbYQp6qgC&amp;pg=PA146&amp;lpg=PA146&amp;dq=Chip+Cravaack+29+1959&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=dftJ4AenBk&amp;sig=Hi8jNTd_ZzW4rLfP1IM1s74ZTpg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TVIRU83AJMzy2gWxwYGABQ&amp;ved=0CHMQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Chip%20Cravaack%2029%201959&amp;f=false|chapter=Raymond "Chip" Cravaack}}&lt;/ref&gt; His ancestry includes [[German American|German]], [[Italian American|Italian]], and [[Germans of Romania|Romanian-German]].&lt;ref&gt;http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~battle/reps/cravaack.htm&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up in the suburbs of [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], graduating from [[St. Xavier High School (Cincinnati)|St.&amp;nbsp;Xavier High School]] in 1977.&lt;ref name="St. Xavier"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gets ready"/&gt; He was raised a Republican in a family that had a military background; his father, Ray, served in the [[Korean War]], and his grandfather served in [[World War&amp;nbsp;I]].&lt;ref name="gets ready"/&gt; Cravaack graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1981, receiving a bachelor of science degree.

==Military service==
Following graduation, Cravaack served in the [[U.S. Navy|Navy]] as a helicopter pilot, fulfilling an early ambition.&lt;ref name="giant killer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gets ready"/&gt; While in the Navy, he earned a [[Master of Education|master's degree in education]] from the [[University of West Florida]] to prepare for his post-military career.&lt;ref name="gets ready"/&gt; After his discharge from active duty, he served in the [[United States Navy Reserve|Naval Reserve]], primarily with [[aircraft carrier]] crew augmentation unit, doing administrative work in support, and retiring in 2009 with the rank of [[Captain (U.S. Navy)|Captain]].&lt;ref name="gets ready"/&gt;

==Northwest Airlines career==
Cravaack moved to Minnesota and began working as a pilot for [[Northwest Airlines]] in 1990. He was out of work for two years in the early 1990s due to layoffs, during which time he became a simulator instructor for a subsidiary of Northwest Airlines teaching foreign pilots.&lt;ref name="gets ready"/&gt;&lt;ref name="met his match"/&gt;

He was a [[union steward]] for the [[Airline Pilots Association]].&lt;ref name="giant killer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="met his match"/&gt; He served as a "strike coordinator" during the 1998 pilots' [[Strike action|strike]], bringing military discipline and parade-ground style marching to the [[Picketing (protest)|picket lines]].&lt;ref name="gets ready"/&gt;

He and his family settled in [[Lindstrom, Minnesota|Lindstrom]], northeast of [[Minneapolis]].&lt;ref name="about"/&gt; He retired from Northwest in 2007 due to [[sleep apnea]], receiving a $79,000 per year as medical [[disability pension]], and becoming a [[stay-at-home dad]] for a time.&lt;ref name="giant killer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gets ready"/&gt; In addition, Cravaack has said he drew [[unemployment benefits]] during a [[furlough]] from Northwest in the early 1990s.

Presently Cravaack resides in New Hampshire and is a teacher, teaching U.S. History, Economics and U.S. Government.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
;2010
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Minnesota, 2010#District 8}}

He was inspired to run for Congress by a suggestion from a [[talk radio]] show host that voters demand [[town hall meeting]]s with their congressmen during the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|health care bill]] [[Tea Party movement]] protests of August 2009.&lt;ref name="gets ready"/&gt; Cravaack went with 25&amp;nbsp;people to one of Oberstar's Minnesota offices asking for a meeting that day and when Oberstar did not come, Cravaack decided to challenge him in the November 2010 election.&lt;ref name="giant killer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gets ready"/&gt;

Cravaack entered the race as a political novice and an underdog.&lt;ref name="met his match"/&gt; The 8th had been in Democratic hands since 1947, and Oberstar was the longest-serving Congressman in Minnesota's history, usually cruising to re‑election.&lt;ref name="gets ready"/&gt;&lt;ref name="met his match"/&gt;  Geography also seemed to be against Cravaack as well; his home in Lindstrom is located in [[Chisago County]], in the southern portion of the district.

According to the ''[[Star Tribune]]'', Cravaack's campaign was "structured like a military operation".&lt;ref name="gets ready"/&gt; He toured the district in a [[motor home]] dubbed "The War Wagon," and ranked volunteers with titles such as commander, captain, and precinct lieutenant.&lt;ref name="met his match"/&gt; He discovered that his experience as a [[union steward]] attracted the interest of district voters, especially the [[miner]]s.&lt;ref name="met his match"/&gt;

Cravaack campaigned on a platform of [[free-market]] principles and government spending cuts.&lt;ref name="gets ready"/&gt; He attacked Oberstar's vote on the health care bill, saying he would vote to repeal and replace it, and called an Oberstar-approved extension of the [[Clean Water Act]] to include wet meadows, a "land grab" by the federal government.&lt;ref name="met his match"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jobs carry"/&gt; He criticized the [[Earmark (politics)|earmark]] process that Oberstar had used to fund [[infrastructure]] projects in the district, saying it was time for the spending to stop.&lt;ref name="giant killer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="met his match"/&gt; Cravaack also attacked Oberstar's vote on "[[Emissions trading|cap and trade]]" legislation to limit [[carbon emissions]], saying it would result in higher energy prices.&lt;ref name="met his match"/&gt;  In his first ad, Cravaack paid homage to Oberstar's service, saying that he ran against Oberstar "with all due respect," but accused him of having lost touch with the district.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|zkfLMe9G8HQ|Cravaack's first ad}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A candidate debate held in [[Duluth, Minnesota|Duluth]] featured a crowd that jeered Oberstar, with Oberstar calling for a more civil atmosphere at the next debate.&lt;ref name="jobs carry"/&gt; The second debate centered on economic issues.&lt;ref name="jobs carry"/&gt; Cravaack argued that the 2003 [[Bush tax cuts]] should be continued on all [[tax bracket]]s to stimulate employment, and Oberstar said he would end the tax cut for the top two percent of earners, because the lowered tax had caused part of the [[Deficit spending|deficit]].&lt;ref name="jobs carry"/&gt;

A poll conducted for [[KSTP-TV]] in the [[Minneapolis–Saint Paul|Twin Cities]] in October showed Oberstar ahead of Cravaack by only one point, 47 to 46 percent.&lt;ref name="poll"/&gt; Cravaack received the [[Political endorsement|endorsement]] of former [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] [[Newt Gingrich]] as the polls tightened.&lt;ref name="met his match"/&gt; He was also endorsed by Minnesota's largest [[Opposition to legal abortion|pro-life]] organization, [[Minnesota Citizens Concerned for Life]], and the largest newspaper in the district, the ''[[Duluth News Tribune]]''.&lt;ref name="giant killer"/&gt; In the November 2 election, Cravaack scored one of the biggest upsets in Minnesota political history,&lt;ref name="stunning"/&gt; defeating Oberstar by only 4,400 votes, 48 percent to 47 percent.&lt;ref name="defeats"/&gt; Cravaack believed the abortion issue was crucial to his victory; he had argued that the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|health care legislation]] that Oberstar had voted for allowed for the [[Abortion in the United States#Abortion financing|payment of abortions]] with taxpayer funds, and [[Legality of euthanasia#United States|encouraged euthanasia]] for the elderly.&lt;ref name="gets ready"/&gt; By the time he won the election, Cravaack characterized the bill as an example of [[socialized medicine]] that will result in the rationing of medical care.&lt;ref name="gets ready"/&gt;

;2012
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Minnesota, 2012#District 8}}
Cravaack was defeated by Democratic nominee [[Rick Nolan]], a former U.S. Representative for the 6th district.

===Tenure===
Following his election in November 2010, Cravaack backed fellow Minnesota Representative, [[Michele Bachmann]] for the number four GOP leadership position of House Republican Conference chair.&lt;ref name="backs Bachmann"/&gt;

In March 2011, Cravaack came under criticism by Duluth students and community leaders for his vote in favor of a budget bill made cuts to increased federal spending on federal [[Pell Grant]] program that provides [[Student financial aid in the United States|financial aid]] to college students, including 30 percent of the students at the [[University of Minnesota Duluth]].&lt;ref name="under fire"/&gt; He also came to press attention for implying during a [[United States House Committee on Homeland Security|House Homeland Security Committee]] hearing that [[Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department|Los Angeles County Sheriff]] [[Lee Baca]] was furthering the goals of a terrorist organization.&lt;ref name="tangles with"/&gt;

In March 2012 Cravaack introduced a bill in Congress that would allow [[mining]] and [[logging]] in the [[Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness]] and [[Superior National Forest]] through a land exchange that would rely on the state environmental review process and bypass federal environmental reviews, with proceeds going to the school districts.&lt;ref name="BWCA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="school trust"/&gt;

He also sponsored a bill,  which became law that the TSA ensures that military personnel were treated with respect while traveling on orders or while wearing their uniforms.  “The bill’s intent, he said, is that the military personnel would be able to go through security with the same ease as registered flyers.” &lt;ref name="brainerddispatch.com"&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Rourke|first=Mike|title=Cravaack: Nation’s Financial Problems Demand Action Now |work=Brainerd Dispatch | location=Brainerd, Minnesota |date=October 21, 2012 |url=http://brainerddispatch.com/news/political/2012-10-21/cravaack-nations-financial-problems-demand-action-now}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is against sequestration and voted against the Budget Control Act, stating “You cut with a scalpel not a meat ax." &lt;ref name="brainerddispatch.com"/&gt;

Cravaack ran for 2012 reelection and was endorsed by ''Mesabi Daily News'' in [[Virginia, Minnesota|Virginia]] and ''Duluth News Tribune''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Kimball|first=Joe|title=Duluth Paper Again Endorses Cravaack in 8th District Congressional Race |publisher=MinnPost |date=October 22, 2012 |url=http://www.minnpost.com/political-agenda/2012/10/duluth-paper-again-endorses-cravaack-8th-district-congressional-race}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the elections held on November 6, 2012, Cravaak was defeated for re-election by 9 points by Democratic former Congressman [[Rick Nolan]].
