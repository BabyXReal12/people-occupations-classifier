'''James Maitland Stewart''' (May 20, 1908{{spaced ndash}}July 2, 1997) was an American actor and military officer who is among the most honored and popular stars in film history. A major [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] contract player, Stewart was known for his distinctive drawl and down-to-earth persona, which helped him often portray American middle-class men struggling in crisis. Many of the films in which he starred have become enduring classics.

Stewart was nominated for five [[Academy Awards]], winning one for ''[[The Philadelphia Story (film)|The Philadelphia Story]]'' (1940), and received an [[Academy Honorary Award|Academy Lifetime Achievement]] award in 1985. In 1999, Stewart was named [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars|the third-greatest male screen legend]] of the [[Golden Age of Hollywood]] by the [[American Film Institute]], behind [[Humphrey Bogart]] and [[Cary Grant]].&lt;ref name="Stars"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.afi.com/100years/stars.aspx |title=AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Stars |website=American Film Institute (Afi.com) |date=June 16, 1999 |accessdate=June 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American Film Institute has also named five of Stewart's films to its list of the 100 best American films ever made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1980 James Stewart Tribute|url=http://www.afi.com/laa/laa80.aspx|website=AFI Life Achievement Award|publisher=American Film Institute|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100617061647/http://www.afi.com/laa/laa80.aspx|archivedate=June 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also had a noted military career and was a [[World War II]] and [[Vietnam War]] veteran and [[aviator|pilot]], who rose to the rank of [[Brigadier General (United States)|Brigadier General]] in the [[Air Force Reserve Command|United States Air Force Reserve]], becoming the highest-ranking actor in military history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Smith |first=Lynn |title=In Supporting Roles |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=March 30, 2003 |page=193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==
[[File:James Stewart in After the Thin Man trailer.jpg|left|thumb|''[[After the Thin Man]]'' (1936)]]

James Maitland Stewart was born on May 20, 1908, in [[Indiana, Pennsylvania]], the son of Elizabeth Ruth (''née'' Jackson; March 16, 1875{{snds}}August 2, 1953) and Alexander Maitland Stewart (May 19, 1871 – December 28, 1961), who owned a hardware store.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmreference.com/film/84/James-Stewart.html "James Stewart profile"].

Retrieved October 28, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Stewart was mainly of [[Scottish people|Scottish]] ancestry and was raised as a [[Presbyterian]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/packages/html/movies/bestpictures/take-ar.html "Movies: Best Pictures"].

Retrieved March 7, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=elt12&gt;Eliot 2006, pp. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt; He was descended from veterans of the [[American Revolution]], the [[War of 1812]], and the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref name=elt12/&gt; The eldest of three children (he had two younger sisters, Virginia Wilson Stewart and Mary Kelly Stewart), young Jimmy was expected to one day inherit his father's store and continue a business that had been in the family for three generations.&lt;ref name="1920 Census"&gt;[https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/3:1:33SQ-GRX7-566?i=12&amp;cc=1488411 "Fourteenth Census of the United States: 1920"], enumeration dates January 8–9, 1920; 4th Ward, Indiana Borough, Indiana County, Pennsylvania. Digital copy of original census page, [[FamilySearch]]. Retrieved August 3, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eliot 2006, p. 15"&gt;Eliot 2006, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; His mother was an excellent pianist, but his father discouraged Stewart's request for music lessons. When his father once accepted a gift of an accordion from a guest, Stewart quickly learned to play the instrument, which became a fixture offstage during his acting career. As the family grew, music continued to be an important part of family life.&lt;ref name="Eliot 2006, p. 15"/&gt;

Stewart attended [[Mercersburg Academy]] prep school, graduating in 1928. He was active in a variety of activities. He played on the football and track teams (competing as a high jumper under coach [[Jimmy Curran]]), was art editor of the ''KARUX'' yearbook, and a member of the choir club, [[glee club]], and John Marshall Literary Society. During his first summer break, Stewart returned to his hometown to work as a brick loader for a local construction company and on highway and road construction jobs where he painted lines on the roads. Over the following two summers, he took a job as an assistant with a professional magician.&lt;ref name="The Jimmy Stewart Museum"&gt;[http://www.jimmy.org/biography "Biography"]. ''The Jimmy Stewart Museum''. Retrieved January 11, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; He made his first appearance onstage at Mercersburg, as Buquet in the play ''The Wolves''.&lt;ref&gt;Eliot 2006, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

A shy child, Stewart spent much of his after-school time in the basement working on model airplanes, mechanical drawing, and chemistry—all with a dream of going into aviation. It was a dream greatly enhanced by the legendary 1927 flight of [[Charles Lindbergh]], whose progress 19-year-old Stewart, then stricken with [[scarlet fever]], was avidly following from home, foreshadowing his starring movie role as Lindbergh 30 years later.&lt;ref name=Berg&gt;{{cite book|last=Berg|first=A. Scott|title=Lindbergh|date=1999|publisher=Berkley/Penguin|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-425-17041-0|page=121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, he abandoned visions of being a pilot when his father insisted that instead of the [[United States Naval Academy]] he attend [[Princeton University]]. Stewart enrolled at Princeton in 1928 as a member of the class of 1932. He excelled at studying [[architecture]], so impressing his professors with his thesis on an airport design that he was awarded a scholarship for graduate studies,&lt;ref name="The Jimmy Stewart Museum"/&gt; but he gradually became attracted to the school's drama and music clubs, including the [[Princeton Triangle Club]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.princeton.edu/~triangle/content_page/history.html "Princeton Triangle Club"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002221003/http://www.princeton.edu/~triangle/content_page/history.html |date=2011-10-02 }}. ''princeton.edu''. Retrieved January 11, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; His acting and accordion talents at Princeton led him to be invited to the [[University Players]], an intercollegiate summer stock company in [[West Falmouth, Massachusetts]], on [[Cape Cod]]. The company had been organized in 1928 and would run until 1932, with [[Joshua Logan]], [[Bretaigne Windust]] and Charles Leatherbee as directors. Stewart performed in bit parts in the Players' productions in [[Cape Cod]] during the summer of 1932, after he graduated.

The troupe had previously included [[Henry Fonda]] and [[Margaret Sullavan]]. Stewart and Fonda became close friends over the summer of 1932 when they shared an apartment with [[Joshua Logan]] and [[Myron McCormick]].&lt;ref&gt;Fonda and Teichmann 1981, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; When Stewart came to New York at the end of the summer stock season, which had included the Broadway tryout of ''Goodbye Again'', he shared an apartment with Fonda, who had by then finalized his divorce from Sullavan. Along with fellow University Players [[Alfred Dalrymple]] and [[Myron McCormick]], Stewart debuted on Broadway in the brief run of ''[[Carry Nation (play)|Carry Nation]]'' and a few weeks later – again with McCormick and Dalrymple – as a chauffeur in the comedy ''Goodbye Again'', in which he had two lines. ''[[The New Yorker]]'' commented, "Mr. James Stewart's chauffeur... comes on for three minutes and walks off to a round of spontaneous applause."&lt;ref&gt;Eliot 2006, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Yellow Jack play starring James Stewart, drawing from Herald Tribune.jpg|thumb|right|[[Al Hirschfeld]] drawing of a scene from ''[[Yellow Jack (play)|Yellow Jack]]'' (Stewart is at upper left)]]
The play was a moderate success, but times were hard. Many Broadway theaters had been converted to movie houses and the [[Great Depression|Depression]] was reaching bottom. "From 1932 through 1934", Stewart later recalled, "I'd only worked three months. Every play I got into folded."&lt;ref&gt;Eliot 2006, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1934, he was given more substantial stage roles, including the modest hit ''Page Miss Glory'' and his first dramatic stage role in [[Sidney Howard]]'s ''[[Yellow Jack (play)|Yellow Jack]]'', which convinced him to continue his acting career. However, Stewart and Fonda, still roommates, were both struggling. In the fall of 1934, Fonda's success in ''[[The Farmer Takes a Wife]]'' took him to [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]]. Finally, Stewart attracted the interest of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] scout Bill Grady who saw Stewart on the opening night of ''Divided by Three'', a glittering première with many luminaries in attendance, including [[Irving Berlin]], [[Moss Hart]] and Fonda, who had returned to New York for the show. With Fonda's encouragement, Stewart agreed to take a screen test, after which he signed a contract with MGM in April 1935, as a contract player for up to seven years at $350 a week.&lt;ref&gt;Eliot 2006, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Shopworn Angel trailer.JPG|thumb|left|Stewart made four features with [[Margaret Sullavan]], the second of which was ''[[The Shopworn Angel]]'' (1938)]]
Upon Stewart's arrival by train in Los Angeles, Fonda greeted him at the station and took him to Fonda's studio-supplied lodging, next door to [[Greta Garbo]]. Stewart's first job at the studio was as a participant in screen tests with newly arrived starlets. At first, he had trouble being cast in Hollywood films owing to his gangling looks and shy, humble screen presence. Aside from an unbilled appearance in a [[Shemp Howard]] comedy [[short subject|short]] called ''[[Art Trouble]]'' in 1934, his first film was the poorly received [[Spencer Tracy]] vehicle ''[[The Murder Man]]'' (1935). ''[[Rose Marie (1936 film)|Rose Marie]]'' (1936), an adaptation of a popular operetta, was more successful. After having mixed success in films, he received his first intensely dramatic role in 1936's ''[[After the Thin Man]]'', and played [[Jean Harlow]]'s character's frustrated boyfriend in the [[Clark Gable]] vehicle ''[[Wife vs. Secretary]]'' earlier that same year.

On the romantic front, he dated newly divorced [[Ginger Rogers]].&lt;ref&gt;Eliot 2006, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; The romance soon cooled, however, and by chance Stewart encountered Margaret Sullavan again. Stewart found his footing in Hollywood thanks largely to Sullavan, who campaigned for Stewart to be her [[leading man]] in the 1936 romantic comedy ''[[Next Time We Love]]''. She rehearsed extensively with him, having a noticeable effect on his confidence. She encouraged Stewart to feel comfortable with his unique mannerisms and boyish charm and use them naturally as his own style. Stewart was enjoying Hollywood life and had no regrets about giving up the stage, as he worked six days a week in the MGM factory.&lt;ref&gt;Eliot 2006, pp. 84, 87.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936, he acquired big-time agent [[Leland Hayward]], who would eventually marry Sullavan. Hayward started to chart Stewart's career, deciding that the best path for him was through loan-outs to other studios.

==Pre-war success==
[[File:James Stewart in You Can't Take It with You.jpg|thumb|left|[[Frank Capra]]'s comedy ''[[You Can't Take It With You (film)|You Can't Take It With You]]'' (1938) was one of the films that brought Stewart widespread attention]]
In 1938 Stewart had a brief, tumultuous romance with Hollywood queen [[Norma Shearer]], whose husband, [[Irving Thalberg]], head of production at MGM, had died two years earlier. Stewart began a successful partnership with director [[Frank Capra]] in 1938, when he was loaned out to [[Columbia Pictures]] to star in ''[[You Can't Take It With You (film)|You Can't Take It With You]]''. Capra had been impressed by Stewart's minor role in ''[[Navy Blue and Gold (film)|Navy Blue and Gold]]'' (1937). The director had recently completed several well received films, including ''[[It Happened One Night]]'' (1934), and was looking for the right actor to suit his needs—other recent actors in Capra's films such as [[Clark Gable]], [[Ronald Colman]], and [[Gary Cooper]] did not quite fit. Not only was Stewart just what he was looking for, but Capra also found Stewart understood that archetype intuitively and required very little directing. Later Capra commented, "I think he's probably the best actor who's ever hit the screen."&lt;ref name="Eliot p. 105"&gt;Eliot 2006, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[You Can't Take It With You (film)|You Can't Take It With You]]'', starring Capra's "favorite actress", comedian [[Jean Arthur]], won the 1938 [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]. The following year saw Stewart work with Capra and Arthur again in the political comedy-drama ''[[Mr. Smith Goes to Washington]]''. Stewart replaced intended star [[Gary Cooper]] in the film, playing an idealist thrown into the political arena. Upon its October 1939 release, the film garnered critical praise and became a box-office success. Stewart received the first of five Academy Award nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]]. Stewart's father was still trying to talk him into leaving Hollywood and its sinful ways and to return to his home town to lead a decent life. Stewart took a secret trip to Europe to take a break and returned home in 1939 just as [[Invasion of Poland|Germany invaded Poland]].&lt;ref name="Eliot p. 105"/&gt;

''[[Destry Rides Again]]'', also released in 1939, became Stewart's first [[western movie|western film]], a genre with which he would become identified later in his career. In this western parody, he is a pacifist lawman and [[Marlene Dietrich]] is the dancing saloon girl who comes to love him, but does not get him. Off-screen, Dietrich did get her man, but the romance was short-lived.&lt;ref&gt;Eliot 2006, p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Made for Each Other (1939 film)|Made for Each Other]]'' (1939) had Stewart sharing the screen with [[Carole Lombard]] in a melodrama that garnered good reviews for both stars, but did less well with the public. ''[[Newsweek]]'' wrote that they were "perfectly cast in the leading roles".&lt;ref&gt;Jones, McClure and Twomey 1970, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; Between movies, Stewart began a radio career and became a distinctive voice on the [[Lux Radio Theater]]'s ''[[The Screen Guild Theater]]'' and other shows. So well-known had his slow drawl become that comedians began impersonating him.&lt;ref&gt;Eliot 2006, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940 Stewart and Sullavan reunited for two films. The first, the [[Ernst Lubitsch]] romantic comedy, ''[[The Shop Around the Corner]]'', starred them as co-workers unknowingly involved in a pen-pal romance but who cannot stand each other in real life. It was Stewart's fifth film of the year and one of the rare ones shot in sequence; it was completed in only 27 days.&lt;ref&gt;Eliot 2006, p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Mortal Storm]]'', directed by [[Frank Borzage]], was one of the first blatantly anti-[[Nazism|Nazi]] films to be produced in Hollywood and featured Sullavan and Stewart as friends and then lovers caught in turmoil upon [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s rise to power, literally hunted down by their own friends.

[[File:Philadelphia Story 13.jpg|right|thumb|Stewart won his only [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] for 1940's ''[[The Philadelphia Story (film)|The Philadelphia Story]]''. He is seen here with co-star [[Katharine Hepburn]]]]
Stewart also starred with [[Cary Grant]] and [[Katharine Hepburn]] in [[George Cukor]]'s classic ''[[The Philadelphia Story (film)|The Philadelphia Story]]'' (1940). His performance as an intrusive, fast-talking reporter earned him his only Academy Award in a competitive category (Best Actor, 1941); he beat out his good friend Henry Fonda (''[[The Grapes of Wrath (film)|The Grapes of Wrath]]''). Stewart thought his performance "entertaining and slick and smooth" but lacking the "guts" of "Mr. Smith".&lt;ref&gt;Eliot 2006, p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt; Stewart gave the Oscar statuette to his father, who displayed it for many years in a case inside the front door of his hardware store, alongside other family awards and military medals.

During the months before he began military service, Stewart appeared in a series of [[screwball comedy|screwball comedies]] with varying levels of success. He followed ''[[No Time for Comedy]]'' (1940) with [[Rosalind Russell]] and ''[[Come Live with Me (film)|Come Live with Me]]'' (1941) with [[Hedy Lamarr]] with the [[Judy Garland]] musical ''[[Ziegfeld Girl (film)|Ziegfeld Girl]]'' and the [[George Marshall (director)|George Marshall]] romantic comedy ''[[Pot o' Gold (film)|Pot o' Gold]]'', featuring [[Paulette Goddard]]. Stewart was drafted in late 1940, a situation that coincided with the lapse in his [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] contract, marking a turning point in Stewart's career, with 28 movies to his credit at that point.&lt;ref&gt;Eliot 2006, p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stewart's family on both sides had deep military roots, as both grandfathers had fought in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]],&lt;ref name=elt12/&gt; and his father had served during both the [[Spanish–American War]] and [[World War I]]. Stewart considered his father to be the biggest influence on his life, so it was not surprising that, when another war came, he too was willing to serve. Members of his family had previously been in the infantry, but Stewart chose to become a flier.&lt;ref&gt;Smith 2005, pp. 25–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

An early interest in flying led Stewart to gain his [[Private Pilot License|private pilot certificate]] in 1935 and [[Commercial Pilot Licence|commercial pilot license]] in 1938. He often flew cross-country to visit his parents in Pennsylvania, navigating by the railroad tracks.&lt;ref name="The Jimmy Stewart Museum" /&gt; Nearly two years before the December 1941 [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], Stewart had accumulated over 400 hours of flying time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=1670 "Brigadier General James Stewart"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110318134905/http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=1670 |date=2011-03-18 }}.

Considered a highly proficient pilot, he entered a cross-country race as a co-pilot in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;Smith 2005, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Stewart, along with musician/composer [[Hoagy Carmichael]], saw the need for trained war pilots, and joined with other Hollywood celebrities to invest in [[Thunderbird Field]], a pilot-training school built and operated by [[Southwest Airways]] in [[Glendale, Arizona]]. This airfield became part of the [[United States Army Air Forces]] training establishment and trained more than 10,000 pilots during World War II.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110622085538/http://www.airfields-freeman.com/AZ/Airfields_AZ_Phoenix_NW.htm "Thunderbird Field"]. airfields-freeman.com.

In October 1940, Stewart was drafted into the [[United States Army]] but was rejected for failing to meet the weight requirements for his height for new recruits—Stewart was {{convert|5|lbs|kg}} under the standard. To get up to {{convert|143|lbs|kg}}, he sought out the help of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's muscle man and trainer Don Loomis, who was noted for his ability to help people gain or lose weight in his studio gymnasium. Stewart subsequently attempted to enlist in the [[United States Army Air Corps|Air Corps]], but still came in underweight, although he persuaded the enlistment officer to run new tests, this time passing the weigh-in,&lt;ref name="Smith p. 30"&gt;Smith 2005, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Stewart later confided that he had a 'friend' operating the weight scales.&lt;ref name="Smith p. 30" /&gt;|group=N}} with the result that Stewart enlisted and was inducted in the Army on March 22, 1941. He became the first major American movie star to wear a military uniform in [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=Munn&gt;Munn, Michael.

Stewart enlisted as a private&lt;ref name="The Jimmy Stewart Museum" /&gt;&lt;ref name="jcs-group" /&gt; but applied for an Air Corps commission and [[Auxiliary Pilot Badge#Service Pilot|Service Pilot]] rating as both a college graduate and a licensed commercial pilot. Soon to be 33, he was almost six years beyond the maximum age restriction for Aviation Cadet training, the normal path of commissioning for pilots, navigators and bombardiers. The now-obsolete auxiliary pilot ratings (Glider Pilot, Liaison Pilot and Service Pilot) differed from the Aviation Cadet Program in that a higher maximum age limit and corrected vision were allowed upon initial entry. Stewart received his commission as a second lieutenant on January 1, 1942,&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, "James Stewart Now Is Second Lieutenant", ''The Spokesman-Review'', Spokane, Washington, Friday 2 January 1942, Volume 59, Number 233, page 2.&lt;/ref&gt;   shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor, while a corporal at [[Moffett Field]], California. He received his Service Pilot rating at that time, under the [[Auxiliary Pilot Badge|Service Pilot]] program established in March 1942 for experienced former civilian pilots. Although Service Pilots were normally restricted to noncombat flying, they were permitted to fly overseas on cargo and utility transports, typically with Air Transport, Ferry or Troop Carrier Commands. Under the regulations of the period, a Service Pilot could obtain an unrestricted Pilot rating after one year of USAAF service on flying status, provided he met certain flight experience requirements and passed an evaluation board, and some did in fact go on to combat flying assignments.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Army Air Forces (1 October 1943).

Public appearances by Stewart were limited engagements scheduled by the Army Air Forces. "Stewart appeared several times on network radio with [[Edgar Bergen]] and [[Charlie McCarthy]].

Stewart was concerned that his expertise and celebrity status would relegate him to instructor duties "behind the lines".&lt;ref&gt;Smith 2005, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; His fears were confirmed when, after his promotion to first lieutenant on July 7, 1942,&lt;ref name="sm273"&gt;Smith 2005, p. 273.&lt;/ref&gt; he was stationed from August to December 1942 at [[Kirtland Air Force Base|Kirtland Army Airfield]] in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]], piloting [[Beechcraft Model 18|AT-11 Kansans]] used in training bombardiers. He was transferred to [[Hobbs Army Airfield]], New Mexico, for three months of transition training in the four-engine [[B-17 Flying Fortress]], then sent to the Combat Crew Processing Center in [[Salt Lake City]], where he expected to be assigned to a combat unit. Instead, he was assigned in early 1943 to an operational training unit, the [[29th Flying Training Wing|29th Bombardment Group]] at [[Boise Airport#Gowen Field|Gowen Field]], [[Boise, Idaho]], as an instructor.&lt;ref name="jcs-group" /&gt; He was promoted to captain on July 9, 1943,&lt;ref name="sm273" /&gt; and appointed a squadron commander.&lt;ref name="sm42" /&gt; To Stewart, now 35, combat duty seemed far away and unreachable, and he had no clear plans for the future.

[[File:Maj. Jimmy Stewart.jpg|right|thumb|Major Jimmy Stewart in 1943]]
In August 1943, Stewart was assigned to the 445th Bomb Group as operations officer of the [[703d Bombardment Squadron]], but after three weeks became its commander. On October 12, 1943, judged ready to go overseas, the 445th Bomb Group staged to [[Lincoln Army Airfield]], Nebraska. Flying individually, the aircraft first flew to [[Palm Beach Air Force Base|Morrison Army Airfield]], Florida, and then on the circuitous [[South Atlantic air ferry route in World War II|Southern Route]] along the coasts of South America and Africa to [[RAF Tibenham]], [[Norfolk]], [[England]]. After several weeks of training missions, in which Stewart flew with most of his combat crews, the group flew its first combat mission on December 13, 1943, to bomb the [[U-boat]] facilities at [[Kiel]], [[Germany]], followed three days later by a mission to [[Bremen]]. Stewart led the high squadron of the group formation on the first mission, and the entire group on the second.&lt;ref name="sm44"&gt;McGowan "From Private to Colonel", p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Following a mission to [[Ludwigshafen]], Germany, on January 7, 1944, Stewart was promoted to major.&lt;ref name="sm44" /&gt;{{refn|While leading the 445th on this date, Stewart made a decision in combat to not break formation from another group that had made an error in navigation. The other group lost four bombers in a subsequent interception, but Stewart's decision possibly saved it from annihilation and incurred considerable damage to his own 48 aircraft. His decision resulted in a letter of commendation and promotion to major on January 20, 1944. [[Sy Bartlett]] and [[Beirne Lay]] used the episode in their novel ''12 O'Clock High''.&lt;ref name="sm273" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sm44" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bowman 1979, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=N}} Stewart was awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] for actions as deputy commander of the [[2d Bombardment Wing (World War II)|2nd Combat Bombardment Wing]] on the first day of "[[Big Week]]" operations in February and flew two other missions that week.&lt;ref name="sm45"&gt;McGowan "From Private to Colonel", p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 22, 1944, Stewart flew his 12th combat mission, leading the 2nd Bomb Wing in an attack on [[Berlin]]. On March 30, 1944, he was sent to [[RAF Old Buckenham]] to become group operations officer of the [[453rd Bombardment Group]], a new B-24 unit that had just lost both its commander and operations officer on missions.&lt;ref name="sm4546"&gt;McGowan "From Private to Colonel", pp. 45–46.&lt;/ref&gt; To inspire the unit, Stewart flew as command pilot in the lead B-24 on several missions deep into Nazi-occupied Europe. As a staff officer, Stewart was assigned to the 453rd "for the duration" and thus not subject to a quota of missions of a combat tour. He nevertheless assigned himself as a combat crewman on the group's missions until his promotion to lieutenant colonel on June 3&lt;ref name="sm273" /&gt; and reassignment on July 1, 1944, to the 2nd Bomb Wing, assigned as [[executive officer]] to Brigadier General Edward J. Timberlake. His official tally of mission credits while assigned to the 445th and 453rd Bomb Groups was 20 sorties.

Stewart continued to go on missions uncredited, flying with the [[pathfinder (RAF)|pathfinder]] squadron of the [[389th Bombardment Group]], with his two former groups and with groups of the [[20th Bombardment Wing (World War II)|20th Combat Bomb Wing]].&lt;ref name="sm4647"&gt;McGowan "From Private to Colonel", pp. 46–47.&lt;/ref&gt; He received a second award of the Distinguished Flying Cross for actions in combat and was awarded the French [[Croix de guerre 1939–1945|Croix de Guerre]]. He also was awarded the [[Air Medal]] with three [[oak leaf cluster]]s.

Stewart served in a number of staff positions in the 2nd and 20th Bomb Wings between July 1944 and the end of the war in Europe, and was promoted to full colonel on March 29, 1945.&lt;ref name="sm273" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McGowan "From Private to Colonel", p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;  Less than two months later, on May 10, he succeeded to command briefly the 2nd Bomb Wing, a position he held until June 15, 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Maurer 1983, p. 375.&lt;/ref&gt; Stewart was one of the few Americans to ever rise from private to colonel in only four years during the Second World War.&lt;ref name="The Jimmy Stewart Museum" /&gt;&lt;ref name="jcs-group" /&gt;

At the beginning of June 1945, Stewart was the presiding officer of the [[court-martial]] of a pilot and navigator who were charged with dereliction of duty for having [[Bombings of Switzerland in World War II#Zurich and Basel|accidentally bombed the Swiss city of Zurich]] the previous March—the first instance of U.S. personnel being tried for an attack on a neutral country.

Stewart continued to play a role in the Army Air Forces Reserve following World War II and the new [[Air Force Reserve Command|United States Air Force Reserve]] after the official establishment of the [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] as an independent service in 1947.

Stewart, however, often did his part in publicizing and promoting military service in general and the United States Air Force in particular.

==Postwar career==
After the war, Stewart took time off to reassess his career.&lt;ref&gt;Eliot 2006, p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt; He was an early investor in [[Southwest Airways]], founded by [[Leland Hayward]], and considered going into the aviation industry if his restarted film career did not prosper.&lt;ref&gt;Eliot 2006, p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon Stewart's return to Hollywood in fall 1945, he decided not to renew his MGM contract. He signed with the [[Music Corporation of America|MCA]] talent agency.

For his first film in five years, Stewart appeared in his third and final [[Frank Capra]] production, ''It's a Wonderful Life ''(1946).&lt;ref name="Cox p. 6"&gt;Cox 2005, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Although Stewart was always Capra's first choice, in an interview later in life, he conceded that "Henry Fonda was in the running."&lt;ref name="Cox p. 6"/&gt;|group=N}} The role was Stewart's first since returning from service in World War II, during which he experienced what is now recognized as [[post-traumatic stress disorder]]. Capra paid RKO for the rights to the story and formed his own production company, [[Liberty Films]]. The female lead went to [[Donna Reed]] when Capra's perennial first choice, [[Jean Arthur]], was unavailable, and after [[Ginger Rogers]], [[Olivia de Havilland]], [[Ann Dvorak]], and [[Martha Scott]] had all turned down the role.&lt;ref&gt;Eliot 2006, p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt; Stewart appeared as [[George Bailey (fictional character)|George Bailey]], an upstanding small-town man who becomes increasingly frustrated by his ordinary existence and financial troubles. Driven to [[suicide]] on [[Christmas Eve]], he is led to reassess his life by [[Clarence Odbody]],&lt;ref&gt;Cox 2005, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; an "angel, second class" played by [[Henry Travers]].

Although ''It's a Wonderful Life'' was nominated for five Academy Awards, including Stewart's third Best Actor nomination, it received mixed reviews and only disappointingly moderate success at the box office.&lt;ref&gt;Eliot 2006, p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the decades since the film's release, it grew to define Stewart's film persona and is widely considered as a sentimental Christmas film classic and, according to the [[American Film Institute]], one of the [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies|100 best American movies]] ever made. In an interview with [[Michael Parkinson]] in 1973, Stewart declared that out of all the movies he had made, ''It's a Wonderful Life'' was his favorite. After viewing the film, President [[Harry S. Truman]] concluded, "If Bess and I had a son we'd want him to be just like Jimmy Stewart."&lt;ref name="Hesitant Hero"/&gt; In the aftermath of the film, Capra's production company went into bankruptcy, while Stewart started to have doubts about his ability to act after his military hiatus.&lt;ref&gt;Eliot 2006, p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; His father kept insisting he come home and marry a local girl. Meanwhile, in Hollywood, his generation of actors were fading and a new wave of actors would soon remake the town, including [[Marlon Brando]], [[Montgomery Clift]] and [[James Dean]].&lt;ref&gt;Eliot 2006, pp. 208, 211.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:You Gotta Stay Happy poster.jpg|right|thumb|135px]]
''[[Magic Town]]'' (1947), a comedy film directed by [[William A. Wellman]], starring James Stewart and [[Jane Wyman]], was one of the first films about the then-new science of public opinion polling. It was poorly received. He completed ''[[Rope (film)|Rope]]'' (1948) directed by Alfred Hitchcock and ''[[Call Northside 777]]'' (1948), and weathered two box-office disappointments with ''[[On Our Merry Way]]'' (1948), a comedic musical ensemble in which Stewart and Henry Fonda were paired as two jazz musicians, and ''[[You Gotta Stay Happy]]'' (1949), for which the posters depicted Stewart being kissed on one cheek by [[Joan Fontaine]] and on the other by a [[chimpanzee]]. In the [[documentary film]] ''James Stewart: A Wonderful Life'' (1987), hosted by [[Johnny Carson]], Stewart said that he went back to [[Western (genre)|Westerns]] in 1950 in part because of the string of flops.

He returned to the stage to star in [[Mary Coyle Chase]]'s ''[[Harvey (play)|Harvey]]'', which had opened to nearly universal praise in November 1944,&lt;ref name="Eliot 2006, p. 214"&gt;Eliot 2006, p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt; as Elwood P. Dowd, a wealthy eccentric living with his sister and niece, and whose best friend is an invisible rabbit as large as a man. Dowd's eccentricity, especially the friendship with the rabbit, is ruining the niece's hopes of finding a husband. While trying to have Dowd committed to a [[sanatorium]], his sister is committed herself while the play follows Dowd on an ordinary day in his not-so-ordinary life. Stewart took over the role from [[Frank Fay (American actor)|Frank Fay]] and gained an increased [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] following in the unconventional play.&lt;ref name="Eliot 2006, p. 214"/&gt; The play, which ran for nearly three years with Stewart as its star, was successfully adapted into a 1950 [[Harvey (film)|film]], directed by [[Henry Koster]], with Stewart reprising his role and [[Josephine Hull]] portraying his sister. [[Bing Crosby]] was the first choice, but he declined.&lt;ref&gt;Eliot 2006, pp. 208, 213.&lt;/ref&gt; Stewart received his fourth Best Actor nomination for his performance.  Stewart also played the role on Broadway in 1970, which was shot on videotape for NBC as part of the Hallmark Hall of Fame series in 1972, and on the London stage in 1975.

After ''Harvey'', the World War II film ''[[Malaya (film)|Malaya]]'' (1949) with [[Spencer Tracy]], and the conventional but highly successful biographical film ''[[The Stratton Story]]'' in 1949, Stewart's first pairing with "on-screen wife" [[June Allyson]], his career took another turn.&lt;ref&gt;Eliot 2006, p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1950s, he expanded into the [[Western movie|Western]] and [[suspense]] genres, thanks to collaborations with [[Alfred Hitchcock]] and [[Anthony Mann]].

Other performances by Stewart during this time include the critically acclaimed 1950 [[Delmer Daves]] Western ''[[Broken Arrow (1950 film)|Broken Arrow]]'', which featured Stewart as an ex-soldier and Indian agent making peace with the [[Apache]]; a troubled clown in the 1952 [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] ''[[The Greatest Show on Earth (film)|The Greatest Show on Earth]]''; and Stewart's role as Charles Lindbergh in [[Billy Wilder]]'s 1957 ''[[The Spirit of St. Louis (film)|The Spirit of St. Louis]]''. He also starred in the Western radio show ''[[The Six Shooter]]'' for its one-season run from 1953 to 1954. During this time, Stewart wore the same [[cowboy hat]] and rode the same horse, "Pie", in most of his Westerns.&lt;ref name="pie"&gt;[http://www.wildwestweb.net/pie.html "James Stewart's Horse"].

[[Cary Grant]] said of Stewart's acting technique:&lt;blockquote&gt;He had the ability to talk naturally. He knew that in conversations people ''do'' often interrupt one another and it's not always so easy to get a thought out. It took a little time for the sound men to get used to him, but he had an ''enormous'' impact. And then, some years later, [[Marlon Brando|Marlon]] came out and did the same thing all over again—but what people forget is that Jimmy did it first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1997-07-06/entertainment/9707031555_1_jimmy-stewart-james-stewart-george-bailey|title=Jimmy Stewart: The Biggest Little Man|work=Orlando Sentinel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Collaborations with Hitchcock and Mann==
In Stewart's collaborations with director [[Anthony Mann]], he entered the realm of the [[western movie|western]]. Stewart's first appearance in a film directed by Mann came with the 1950 western, ''[[Winchester '73]]''. In choosing Mann (after first choice [[Fritz Lang]] declined), Stewart cemented a powerful partnership.&lt;ref name="Eliot 2006, p. 248"&gt;Eliot 2006, p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt; The film, which became a box-office hit upon its release, set the pattern for their future collaborations. In it, Stewart is a tough, vengeful sharpshooter, the winner of a prized rifle which is stolen and then passes through many hands, until the showdown between Stewart and his brother ([[Stephen McNally]]).&lt;ref name="Eliot 2006, p. 248" /&gt;

[[File:Nakedspur trailer 3.jpg|thumb|right|Stewart made eight films for director [[Anthony Mann]]. Five of them were [[Western (genre)|Westerns]], including ''[[The Naked Spur]]'' (1953).]]

Other Stewart–Mann westerns, such as ''[[Bend of the River]]'' (1952), ''[[The Naked Spur]]'' (1953), ''[[The Far Country]]'' (1954) and ''[[The Man from Laramie]]'' (1955), were perennial favorites among young audiences entranced by the [[American West]]. Frequently, the films featured Stewart as a troubled cowboy seeking redemption, while facing corrupt cattlemen, ranchers and outlaws—a man who knows violence first hand and struggles to control it. The Stewart–Mann collaborations laid the foundation for many of the westerns of the 1950s and remain popular today for their grittier, more realistic depiction of the classic movie genre. Audiences saw Stewart's screen persona evolve into a more mature, more ambiguous, and edgier presence.&lt;ref&gt;Eliot 2006, p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stewart and Mann also collaborated on other films outside the [[western movie|western]] genre. ''[[The Glenn Miller Story]]'' (1954) was critically acclaimed, garnering Stewart a [[BAFTA Award]] nomination, and (together with ''The Spirit of St. Louis'') continued Stewart's portrayals of 'American heroes'. ''[[Thunder Bay (film)|Thunder Bay]]'', released the same year, transplanted the plot arc of their western collaborations to a more contemporary setting, with Stewart as a [[Louisiana]] oil driller facing hostile fishermen. ''[[Strategic Air Command (film)|Strategic Air Command]]'', released in 1955, allowed Stewart to use his experiences in the United States Air Force on film.

Stewart's starring role in ''Winchester '73'' was also a turning point in Hollywood. [[Universal Studios]], who wanted Stewart to appear in both that film and ''Harvey,'' balked at his $200,000 asking price. His agent, [[Lew Wasserman]], brokered an alternate deal, in which Stewart would appear in both films for no pay, in exchange for a percentage of the profits as well as cast and director approval.&lt;ref name="Eliot 2006, p. 245"&gt;Eliot 2006, p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt; Stewart ended up earning about $600,000 for ''Winchester '73'' alone.&lt;ref name="Eliot 2006, p. 245" /&gt; Hollywood's other stars quickly capitalized on this new way of doing business, which further undermined the decaying "[[studio system]]".&lt;ref&gt;Eliot 2006, p. 254.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second collaboration to define Stewart's career in the 1950s was with director [[Alfred Hitchcock]]. Like Mann, Hitchcock uncovered new depths to Stewart's acting, showing a protagonist confronting his fears and his repressed desires. Stewart's first movie with Hitchcock was the technologically innovative 1948 film ''[[Rope (film)|Rope]]'', shot in long "real time" takes.&lt;ref&gt;Eliot 2006, p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:James Stewart in Rear Window trailer 2.jpg|left|thumb|''[[Rear Window]]'' (1954) was one of four films Stewart made with [[Alfred Hitchcock]]. Stewart became the highest-grossing star of 1954 as a result.]]

The two collaborated for the second of four times on the 1954 hit ''[[Rear Window]]'', widely considered one of Hitchcock's masterpieces. Stewart portrays photographer L.B. "Jeff" Jeffries, loosely based on ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' photographer [[Robert Capa]], who projects his fantasies and fears onto the people he observes out his apartment window while on hiatus due to a broken leg. Jeffries gets into more than he can handle, however, when he believes he has witnessed a salesman ([[Raymond Burr]]) hiding evidence of a murder, and when his glamorous girlfriend ([[Grace Kelly]]), at first disdainful of his voyeurism and skeptical about any crime, eventually is drawn in and tries to help solve the mystery. Limited by his wheelchair, Stewart is led by Hitchcock to react to what his character sees with mostly facial responses. It was a landmark year for Stewart, becoming the highest grossing actor of 1954 and the most popular Hollywood star in the world, displacing [[John Wayne]].&lt;ref&gt;Eliot 2006, p. 278.&lt;/ref&gt; Hitchcock and Stewart formed a corporation, Patron Inc., to produce the film, which later became the subject of a [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] case ''[[Stewart v. Abend]]'' (1990).
[[File:Vertigo 1958 trailer embrace.jpg|thumb|With [[Kim Novak]] in ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'', 1958]]
After starring in Hitchcock's remake of the director's [[The Man Who Knew Too Much (1934 film)|earlier]] production, ''[[The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956 film)|The Man Who Knew Too Much]]'' (1956), with [[Doris Day]], Stewart starred, with [[Kim Novak]], in what many consider Hitchcock's most personal film, ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' (1958).&lt;ref&gt;Eliot 2006, p. 310.&lt;/ref&gt; The movie starred Stewart as John "Scottie" Ferguson, a former police investigator suffering from [[acrophobia]], who develops an obsession with a woman he is shadowing. Scottie's obsession inevitably leads to the destruction of everything he once had and believed in. Though the film is widely considered a classic today, ''Vertigo'' met with very mixed reviews and poor box-office receipts upon its release, and marked the last collaboration between Stewart and Hitchcock.&lt;ref&gt;Eliot 2006, p. 321.&lt;/ref&gt; The director reportedly blamed the film's failure on Stewart looking too old to be Kim Novak's love interest, and cast [[Cary Grant]] as Roger Thornhill in ''[[North by Northwest]]'' (1959), a role Stewart had very much wanted. (Grant was actually four years older than Stewart but photographed much younger.) Critical appreciation of all three films continues to be strong. In 2012 ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' was ranked highest in the  ''[[Sight &amp; Sound]]'' critics poll for the greatest films ever made, taking the title from long-standing favorite ''[[Citizen Kane]]''.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-19078948 "Vertigo is named 'greatest film of all time{{'"}}].

===Career in the 1960s and 1970s===
[[File:James Stewart - 1959.jpg|thumb|''Anatomy of a Murder'' (1959)]]
In 1960, Stewart was awarded the [[New York Film Critics Circle Award]] for [[New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] and received his fifth and final [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] nomination, for his role in the 1959 [[Otto Preminger]] film ''[[Anatomy of a Murder]]''. This [[courtroom drama]] stars Stewart as Paul Biegler, the lawyer of a hot-tempered soldier (played by [[Ben Gazzara]]) who claims [[temporary insanity]] after murdering a tavern owner who raped his wife. The film featured a career-making performance by [[George C. Scott]] as the prosecutor. The film was considered quite explicit for its time, and it was a box-office success.&lt;ref&gt;Eliot 2006, p. 332.&lt;/ref&gt; Stewart's nomination was one of seven for the film ([[Charlton Heston]] was the winner with ''Ben-Hur''), and saw his transition into the final decades of his career.

On January 1, 1960, Stewart received news of the death of [[Margaret Sullavan]].&lt;ref&gt;Eliot 2006, p. 337.&lt;/ref&gt; As a friend, mentor, and focus of his early romantic feelings, she had a unique influence on Stewart's life. On April 17, 1961, longtime friend [[Gary Cooper]] was too ill to attend the [[33rd Academy Awards]] ceremony, so Stewart accepted the honorary Oscar on his behalf. Stewart's emotional speech hinted that something was seriously wrong, and the next day newspapers ran the headline, "Gary Cooper has cancer". One month later, on May 13, 1961, six days after his 60th birthday, Cooper died.

In the early 1960s, Stewart took leading roles in three [[John Ford]] films, his first work with the director. The first, ''[[Two Rode Together]]'', paired him with [[Richard Widmark]] in a Western with thematic echoes of Ford's ''[[The Searchers (film)|The Searchers]]''. The next, 1962's ''[[The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance]]'', Stewart's first picture with [[John Wayne]], is a classic "psychological" western, shot in [[black and white]] [[film noir]] style featuring powerful use of shadows in the climactic sequence, with Stewart as an Eastern attorney who goes against his non-violent principles when he is forced to confront a psychopathic outlaw (played by [[Lee Marvin]]) in a small frontier town. At story's end, Stewart's character — now a rising political figure — faces a difficult ethical choice as he attempts to reconcile his actions with his personal integrity. The film's billing is unusual in that Stewart was given [[Billing (filmmaking)|top billing]] over Wayne in the trailers and on the posters but Wayne was listed above Stewart in the film itself. The complex picture garnered mixed reviews but was an instant hit at the box office and became a critical favorite over the ensuing decades.

[[File:Westwon trailer Stewart.png|thumb|&lt;center&gt;''[[How the West Was Won (film)|How the West Was Won]]'' (1962)&lt;/center&gt;]]
''[[How the West Was Won (film)|How the West Was Won]]'' (which Ford co-directed, though without directing Stewart's scenes) and ''[[Cheyenne Autumn]]'' were western epics released in 1962 and 1964 respectively. One of only a handful of movies filmed in true [[Cinerama]], shot with three cameras and exhibited with three simultaneous projectors in theatres, ''How the West Was Won'' went on to win three [[Academy Awards|Oscars]] and reap massive box-office figures. ''[[Cheyenne Autumn]]'', in which a white-suited Stewart played [[Wyatt Earp]] in a long semi-comedic sequence in the middle of the movie, failed domestically and was quickly forgotten. The historical drama was Ford's final Western and Stewart's last feature film with Ford. Stewart's entertainingly memorable middle sequence is not directly connected with the rest of the film and was often excised from the lengthy film in later theatrical exhibition prints and some television broadcasts.

Having played his last romantic lead in ''[[Bell, Book and Candle]]'' (1958), with Kim Novak, and silver-haired (although not all was his—he wore a partial hairpiece starting with ''It's a Wonderful Life'' and in every film thereafter), Stewart transitioned into more family-related films in the 1960s when he signed a multi-movie deal with 20th Century Fox. These included the successful [[Henry Koster]] outing ''[[Mr. Hobbs Takes a Vacation]]'' (1962), and the less memorable films ''[[Take Her, She's Mine]]'' (1963) and ''[[Dear Brigitte]]'' (1965), which featured French model [[Brigitte Bardot]] as the object of Stewart's son's mash notes. The [[American Civil War|Civil War]] period film ''[[Shenandoah (film)|Shenandoah]]'' (1965) and the [[western movie|western]] family film ''[[The Rare Breed]]'' fared better at the box office; the Civil War movie, with strong antiwar and humanitarian themes, was a hit in the South.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

[[File:James stewart hawkins 1973.JPG|left|upright|thumb|In 1973 TV series ''[[Hawkins (TV series)|Hawkins]]''.]]

As an aviator, Stewart was particularly interested in aviation films and had pushed to appear in several in the 1950s, including ''[[No Highway in the Sky]]'' (1951), and ''[[Strategic Air Command (film)|Strategic Air Command]]'' (1955) and ''[[The Spirit of St. Louis (film)|The Spirit of St. Louis]]'' (1957). He continued in this vein in the 1960s, in a role as a hard-bitten pilot in ''[[The Flight of the Phoenix (1965 film)|The Flight of the Phoenix]]'' (1965). Subbing for Stewart, famed stunt pilot and air racer [[Paul Mantz]] was killed when he crashed the "[[Tallmantz Phoenix P-1]]", the specially made, single-engined movie airplane, in an abortive "touch-and-go". Stewart also narrated the film ''[[X-15 (film)|X-15]]'' in 1961. In 1964, he and several other military aviators, including [[Curtis LeMay]], [[Paul Tibbets]], [[Bruce Sundlun]] and [[Arthur Godfrey]], became the founding directors on the board of [[NetJets|Executive Jet Aviation Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;"Paul Tibbets: A Rendezvous With History, Part 3". ''Airport Journals'', June 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

After a progression of lesser western films in the late 1960s and early 1970s, Stewart transitioned from cinema to television. In the 1950s he had made guest appearances on the ''[[Jack Benny]] Program''. Stewart first starred in the [[National Broadcasting Company|NBC]] comedy ''[[The Jimmy Stewart Show]]'', on which he played a college professor. He followed it with the [[Columbia Broadcasting Company|CBS]] [[Mystery fiction|mystery]] ''[[Hawkins (TV series)|Hawkins]]'', in which he played a small town lawyer investigating cases, similar to his character in ''Anatomy of a Murder.'' The series garnered Stewart a [[Golden Globe]] for Best Actor in a Dramatic TV Series, but failed to gain a wide audience, possibly because it rotated with ''[[Shaft (TV series)|Shaft]]'', another high-quality series but with a starkly conflicting demographic, and was cancelled after one season. During this time, Stewart periodically appeared on [[Johnny Carson]]'s ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson|The Tonight Show]]'', sharing poems he had written at different times in his life. His poems were later compiled into a short collection, ''Jimmy Stewart and His Poems'' (1989).&lt;ref&gt;Krier, Beth Ann. [http://articles.latimes.com/1989-09-10/news/vw-2722_1_jimmy-stewart "The muse within Jimmy Stewart"].

Stewart returned to films after an absence of five years with a major supporting role in [[John Wayne]]'s final film, ''[[The Shootist]]'' (1976) where Stewart played a doctor giving Wayne's gunfighter a terminal cancer diagnosis. At one point, both Wayne and Stewart were flubbing their lines repeatedly and Stewart turned to director [[Don Siegel]] and said, "You'd better get two better actors." Stewart also appeared in supporting roles in ''[[Airport '77]]'', the 1978 [[remake]] of ''[[The Big Sleep (1978 film)|The Big Sleep]]'' starring [[Robert Mitchum]] as [[Raymond Chandler]]'s [[Philip Marlowe]], and ''[[The Magic of Lassie]]'' (1978). All three movies received poor reviews, and ''[[The Magic of Lassie]]'' flopped at the box office.

==Later career and last years==
[[File:JamesStewart1981.jpg|thumb|upright|Speaking at [[The Kennedy Center]] on Inauguration Day, 1981, in Washington D.C.]]

Following the failure of ''[[The Magic of Lassie]]'', Stewart went into semi-retirement from acting. He donated his papers, films, and other records to [[Brigham Young University]]'s [[Harold B. Lee Library]] in 1983.&lt;ref name="tollestrup20060213"&gt;Tollestrup, Jon. [http://universe.byu.edu/2006/02/13/collections-thousands-of-artifacts-centuries-of-history/ "Collections: Thousands of Artifacts, Centuries of History"] ''The Daily Universe'', February 13, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Stewart had diversified investments including real estate, oil wells, a charter-plane company and membership on major corporate boards, and he became a multimillionaire. In the 1980s and '90s, he did voiceover work for commercials for [[Campbell Soup Company|Campbell's Soups]].

Stewart's longtime friend [[Henry Fonda]] died in 1982, and former co-star and friend [[Grace Kelly]] died after a car crash shortly afterwards. A few months later, Stewart starred with [[Bette Davis]] in ''[[Right of Way (film)|Right of Way]]''. He filmed several [[television movie]]s in the 1980s, including ''[[Mr. Krueger's Christmas]]'', which allowed him to fulfill a lifelong dream to conduct the [[Mormon Tabernacle Choir]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Joe |last=Bauman |url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/705280308/Utah-Hollywood-connection-runs-deep.html |title=Utah-Hollywood connection runs deep |newspaper=[[Deseret News]] |date=January 26, 2009 |page=B2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made frequent visits to the Reagan White House and traveled on the lecture circuit. The re-release of his Hitchcock films gained Stewart renewed recognition. ''[[Rear Window]]'' and ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' were particularly praised by film critics, which helped bring these pictures to the attention of younger movie-goers. He was presented with an [[Academy Honorary Award]] by [[Cary Grant]] in 1985, "for his 50 years of memorable performances, for his high ideals both on and off the screen, with respect and affection of his colleagues".&lt;ref name="Hesitant Hero"/&gt;

In 1988, Stewart made an impassioned plea in Congressional hearings, along with, among many others, [[Burt Lancaster]], [[Katharine Hepburn]], [[Ginger Rogers]], and film director [[Martin Scorsese]], against [[Ted Turner]]'s decision to '[[Film colorization|colorize]]' classic black and white films, including ''It's a Wonderful Life''. Stewart stated, "the coloring of black-and-white films is wrong. It's morally and artistically wrong and these profiteers should leave our film industry alone".&lt;ref&gt;Eliot 2006, p. 405.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, Stewart founded the [[American Spirit Foundation]] to apply entertainment industry resources to developing innovative approaches to public education and to assist the emerging democracy movements in the former [[Iron Curtain]] countries. [[Peter F. Paul]] arranged for Stewart, through the offices of President [[Boris Yeltsin]], to send a special print of ''It's a Wonderful Life'', translated by [[Lomonosov Moscow State University]], to Russia as the first American program ever to be broadcast on Russian television. It first aired on Russian TV Channel 2 on January 5, 1992, the first day of the existence of the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] and  two days before [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]] [[Christmas]].

In association with politicians and celebrities such as President [[Ronald Reagan]], Supreme Court Chief Justice [[Warren Burger]], California Governor [[George Deukmejian]], [[Bob Hope]] and [[Charlton Heston]], Stewart worked from 1987 to 1993 on projects that enhanced the public appreciation and understanding of the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights.

In 1991, James Stewart voiced the character of Sheriff Wylie Burp in the movie ''[[An American Tail: Fievel Goes West]]'', which was his last film role. Shortly before his 80th birthday, he was asked how he wanted to be remembered. "As someone who 'believed in hard work and love of country, love of family and love of community.'"&lt;ref name="Hesitant Hero"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0520.html "Obituary: James Stewart, the hesitant hero, dies at 89"]. ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 3, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Stewart was almost universally described by his collaborators as a kind, soft-spoken man and a true professional.&lt;ref&gt;Eliot 2006, pp. 164–68.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joan Crawford]] praised the actor as an "endearing perfectionist" with "a droll sense of humor and a shy way of watching you to see if you react to that humor".&lt;ref name="Hesitant Hero"/&gt;
[[File:J.StewartMarriage.jpg|right|thumb|Stewart was married to [[Gloria Hatrick McLean]] from 1949 to her death in 1994]]
When [[Henry Fonda]] moved to Hollywood in 1934, he was again a roommate with Stewart in an apartment in Brentwood,&lt;ref&gt;Fonda and Teichmann 1981, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; and the two gained reputations as playboys.&lt;ref&gt;Fonda and Teichmann 1981, pp. 107–08.&lt;/ref&gt; Both men's children later noted that their favorite activity when not working seemed to be quietly sharing time together while building and painting [[Model aircraft|model airplanes]], a hobby they had taken up in New York, years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Fonda and Teichmann 1981, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

After World War II, Stewart settled down, at age 41, marrying former model [[Gloria Hatrick McLean]] on August 9, 1949. As Stewart loved to recount in self-mockery, "I, I, I pitched the big question to her last night and to my surprise she, she, she said yes!"&lt;ref&gt;Eliot 2006, p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt; Stewart adopted her two sons, Michael and Ronald, and with Gloria he had twin daughters, Judy and Kelly, on May 7, 1951. The couple remained married until her death from lung cancer on February 16, 1994, at the age of 75. Ronald was killed in action in [[Vietnam]] on June 8, 1969, at the age of 24, while serving as a lieutenant in the Marine Corps.&lt;ref name=NYT-GS-1994-02-18&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A03E1DD143BF93BA25751C0A962958260 "Gloria Stewart obituary"].

One of Stewart's lesser-known talents was his homespun poetry. Once, while on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'', he read a poem entitled "[[Beau (poem)|Beau]]" that he had written about his dog. By the end of this reading, Carson's eyes were welling with tears.&lt;ref name=McMahonE-MSNBC-2006-09-12&gt;McMahon, Ed.

Following the assassination of Senator [[Robert F. Kennedy]] in 1968, Stewart, [[Charlton Heston]], [[Kirk Douglas]] and [[Gregory Peck]] issued a statement calling for support of President [[Lyndon B. Johnson|Lyndon Johnson's]] [[Gun Control Act of 1968]].

One of his best friends was fellow actor [[Henry Fonda]], despite the fact that the pair had very different political ideologies. A political argument in 1947 resulted in a fistfight, but they maintained their friendship by never discussing politics again.&lt;ref&gt;Robbins 1985, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; This tale may be apocryphal as Jhan Robbins quotes Stewart as saying: "Our views never interfered with our feelings for each other, we just didn't talk about certain things. I can't remember ever having an argument with him—ever!" However, [[Jane Fonda]] told Donald Dewey for his 1996 biography of Stewart that her father did have a falling out with Stewart at that time, although she did not know whether it was because of their political differences. There is a brief reference to their political differences in character in their film ''[[The Cheyenne Social Club]].''

The library at [[Brigham Young University]] houses his personal papers and movie memorabilia including letters, scrapbooks, and recordings of early radio programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/570301/Jimmy-Stewart.html |title=Jimmy Stewart |date=July 4, 1997 |newspaper=[[Deseret News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Edward L. |last=Carter |url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/570267/BYU-ready-to-expand-its-Stewart-collection.html |title=BYU ready to expand its Stewart collection |date=July 4, 1997 |newspaper=[[Deseret News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1980, Stewart was honored by [[Freedoms Foundation]] of [[Valley Forge, Pennsylvania]], along with [[U.S. Senator]] [[Jake Garn]], [[Ambassadors of the United States|U.S. Ambassador]] [[Shirley Temple|Shirley Temple Black]], [[singer]] [[John Denver]], and [[Nahim Abraham|Tom Abraham]], a businessman from [[Canadian, Texas]], who worked with [[immigrant]]s seeking to become U.S. citizens.&lt;ref&gt;"Tom Abraham to be honored by Freedoms Foundation Feb. 22", ''Canadian Record'', [[Canadian, Texas]], February 14, 1980, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

The registered office is at 835 Philadelphia Street, Indiana, Pa, 15701 and is located within easy walking distance of his place of birth, the home in which he grew up, and the former location of his father's hardware store. A large statue of Stewart stands on the lawn of the Indiana County Courthouse, just feet from the museum.

The Jimmy Stewart Museum houses movie posters and photos, awards, personal artifacts, a gift shop and an intimate 1930's era theatre in which his films are regularly shown.

The [[Indiana County–Jimmy Stewart Airport]] was named in his honor.
