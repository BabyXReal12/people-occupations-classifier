'''Vladimir Konstantinovich Kokkinaki''' ({{lang-ru|Владимир Константинович Коккинаки}}, {{OldStyleDate|25 June|1904|12 June}} - 6 January 1985) was a [[test pilot]] in the [[Soviet Union]], notable for setting twenty-two [[world record]]s and serving as president of the ''[[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale]]''.&lt;ref name=bse&gt;[http://bse.sci-lib.com/article062616.html Great Soviet Encyclopedia entry]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==

Kokkinaki was born in [[Novorossiysk]] on 12 June 1904 (O.S.) to a family of [[Greek people|Greek]] descent. His younger brother, [[Konstantin Kokkinaki]] (1910–1990), was also a distinguished test pilot. In 1921 he finished elementary school, and worked on grape plantations and in the Novorossiysk port.&lt;ref name=warheroes&gt;[http://www.warheroes.ru/hero/hero.asp?Hero_id=591 Biography at ''warheroes.ru'']&lt;/ref&gt;

He entered the [[Red Army]] in 1925, and served in the infantry until July 1927. He then entered the Leningrad Military-Theoretical School of the Red Air Force, from where he graduated in 1928. He subsequently entered the [[Borisoglebsk]] pilot school, from where he graduated in 1930. In April 1931, after a period of service in the 11th Fighter Squadron in the Moscow military district, he was transferred back to the Leningrad Military-Theoretical School as an instructor because of his pilot skills.&lt;ref name=warheroes/&gt;

In the period 1932-1935 he served as test pilot for the Air Force, testing a series of aircraft. The first aircraft he tested was the attack aircraft Kocherigin-Gurevich TSh-3.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ctrl-c.liu.se/misc/RAM/tsh-3.html TSh-3, TsKB-4 (S.A. Kocherigin and M.I.Gurevich)]&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, he entered the [[Ilyushin]] Design Bureau ([[OKB]]) as its chief test pilot, where he remained until 1964. Throughout that period, he was the first to test fly all the aircraft of the OKB, including the prototypes of the [[Ilyushin Il-4]] medium bomber, the [[Ilyushin Il-2|Ilyushin Il-2 ''Shturmovik'']] attack aircraft, the [[Ilyushin Il-28]] jet bomber, and the [[Ilyushin Il-14]] transport aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilyushin.org/eng/history/dates.html Dates of Maiden Flights of Aircraft designed by the Ilyushin Design Bureau] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718094235/http://www.ilyushin.org/eng/history/dates.html |date=2011-07-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He became a member of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] in 1938.&lt;ref name=bse/&gt; Promoted to Major General of Aviation in 1943, during the Second World War Kokkinaki served as head of the Main Inspectorate of the [[People's Commissariat]] for the Aircraft Industry and as head of its flight-test service between the years 1943-1947. He retired from the Air Force in January 1966, but continued working for OKB Ilyushin in a supervisory capacity with overall responsibility for flight testing, with his last project being the [[Ilyushin Il-62]].&lt;ref name=warheroes/&gt;

He became the vice chairman of [[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale]] (FAI) in 1961 and assumed the position of chairman in 1966, a position he held until 1967,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.fai.org/about/history/presidents |title=FAI Presidents |access-date=2008-08-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829220719/http://www.fai.org/about/history/presidents |archive-date=2008-08-29 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; after which he was appointed to the honorary chairmanship.&lt;ref name=peoples&gt;[http://www.peoples.ru/military/aviation/kokkinaki/ Biography at ''peoples.ru'']&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s, he also served as chairman of the USSR Aviation Sport Federation. Kokkinakis lived in Moscow, where he died on 7 January 1985. He is buried in the [[Novodevichy cemetery]] in Moscow, along with his wife, Valentina.&lt;ref name=warheroes/&gt;

==Records==
On 21 November 1935, Kokkinaki managed to obtain the unofficial [[Aircraft records|world record for ceiling]] in a [[Polikarpov I-15]] fighter, reaching the altitude of 14,575 meters. On 20 April 1936, he performed the Nesterov Loop for the first time with a twin-engine aircraft, a  TsKB-26 (the prototype of the [[Ilyushin Il-4]]), in the presence of [[Joseph Stalin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ctrl-c.liu.se/misc/ram/tskb-26.html TsKB-26 (S.V. Ilyushin)]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936-1937, Kokkinaki set seven successive altitude with varying payload records with the TsKB-26.&lt;ref name=airwar&gt;[http://www.airwar.ru/history/aces/legend/pilot/kokkinaki.html Biography at ''airwar.ru'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=records&gt;[http://www.ilyushin.org/eng/history/records.html World Records set up by the Aircraft Developed by the Ilyushin Experimental Design Bureau]&lt;/ref&gt; His first official record, on 17 July 1936, was also the first official Soviet aviation record.&lt;ref name=McCannon&gt;McCannon (1998), p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 June 1937 Kokkinaki flew the circular Moscow - [[Sevastopol]] - [[Yekaterinburg|Sverdlovsk]] - Moscow route, a distance of 5018&amp;nbsp;km, with a DB-3, setting a record in both speed at 5000&amp;nbsp;km range (with a median speed of 325&amp;nbsp;km/h) and range on a circular route.&lt;ref name=records/&gt; This flight was followed three months later by the 4000&amp;nbsp;km Moscow - [[Baku]] - Moscow route.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilyushin.org/eng/history/flights.html Remarkable Flights accomplished by the aircraft developed by the Ilyushin Experimental Design Bureau]&lt;/ref&gt; On 27–28 June 1938, on board a modified TsKB-30 named "[[Moscow|Moskva]]", with A.M. Bryandinskiy as his [[navigator]], Kokkinaki flew from Moscow to [[Spassk-Dalny]] in the Soviet Far East, covering a distance of 7,580&amp;nbsp;km in 24 h 36 min, mostly at an altitude of 7000 meters, with an average speed of 307&amp;nbsp;km/h.&lt;ref name=TsKB-30&gt;[http://www.ctrl-c.liu.se/misc/RAM/tskb-30.html TsKB-30 (S.V. Ilyushin)]&lt;/ref&gt; For this feat, he was awarded the title "[[Hero of the Soviet Union]]" on 17 July.&lt;ref name=warheroes/&gt; On 28 April 1939, with Mikhail Kh. Gordienko as co-pilot, he tried to surpass this feat by performing a non-stop east-west transatlantic flight from Moscow to [[New York City]], to coincide with the opening of the [[1939 New York World's Fair|"Land of Tomorrow" World Fair]].&lt;ref name=McCannon&gt;McCannon (1998), p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to encountering bad weather, the airplane was forced to come down on [[Miscou Island]] in New Brunswick, Canada ([http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,761240,00.html TIME magazine account]). Coming not long after the death of [[Valery Chkalov]], and with the approaching war, this well-publicized debacle spelled the end of the Soviet [[Arctic aviation]] exploits of the 1930s. Despite failing to reach his original destination, he still covered a distance of 8,000&amp;nbsp;km in 22 h 56 min, at an average speed of 348&amp;nbsp;km/h,&lt;ref name=TsKB-30/&gt; and since 1959, the route he used ([[Moscow]]- [[Novgorod]] - [[Helsinki]] - [[Trondheim]] - [[Iceland]] - [[Cape Farewell, Greenland|Cape Farewell]] - Miscou Island) is used for the regular flights between New York and Moscow. In 1965, he was honored by the [[International Air Transport Association]] with the diamond "[[Compass rose|wind rose]]" necklace for his finding the "shortest flight route between Europe and America".&lt;ref name=bse/&gt;&lt;ref name=warheroes/&gt;

From 1958 to 1960, he set another series of thirteen altitude with load and speed records flying the [[Ilyushin Il-18]].&lt;ref name=warheroes/&gt; His last world record was in 1960, when he flew an Il-18 at a distance of 5,018 kilometers with a payload of 10,000&amp;nbsp;kg and a median speed of 693&amp;nbsp;km/h.&lt;ref name=records/&gt;
