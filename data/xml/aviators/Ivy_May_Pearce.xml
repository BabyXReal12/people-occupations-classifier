[[Image:Young Ivy.jpg|thumb|right]]
'''Ivy May Pearce''' (8 June 1914 – 26 April 1998, married name '''Hassard''') was one of the first female pilots in the southern hemisphere and a pioneer of the [[Gold Coast, Queensland]], Australia (Dwyer, N. 1998). She was also noted for a number of fashion boutiques she established in the region and her association with ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' Australia.

==Early life==
Pearce was born in [[Ipswich, Queensland|Ipswich]], Queensland to George and Sarah-Ann Pearce and was raised in a succession of hotels. At three years of age, in 1917, she fell ill with a lung condition that almost claimed her life. She struggled through life and by the time she was 6 her parents decided to send her to [[Dalby, Queensland|Dalby]], in the hope that the drier climate may help her recover.

Pearce and her younger sister, Merle, lived in the [[St Columba's Convent, Dalby|St Columba's Convent]] at Dalby, as this was the only place their parents could find for them to stay. At the convent she began piano lessons, at which she excelled. On her return to [[Brisbane]] she attended [[All Hallows' School|All Hallows Catholic School]] where she also learnt the cello and the violin. It was here that she also received her piano letters.

== Aviator ==
[[File:Archbishop Duhig, after he had flown as her passenger, congratulates Miss Ivy Pearce on the capable manner in which she manages her plane, 4 September 1935.jpg|thumb|Archbishop Duhig, after he had flown as her passenger, congratulates Miss Ivy Pearce on the capable manner in which she manages her plane, 4 September 1935]]
After leaving All Hallows, Pearce developed an interest in flying after her father gave her a [[Tiger Moth]] plane. She was soon flying around her home town of [[Surfers Paradise]] and went on to become one of Australia's first aerobatic pilots, taking her first flying lessons aged only 16, and by 18, had her A-class pilot's licence.

Pearce was an [[aviator]] during the 1930s. One of her best friends of that period was Gloria (''née'' Osborne) Pritchett of [[Bundaberg, Queensland|Bundaberg]]. Gloria frequently flew with Ivy in a two-seat configured biplane and was a bridesmaid at Ivy's wedding. Gloria resided in [[Coronado, California]] until she died in 2008.[[File:Ivy May Pearce and Ernest Hassard before taking off for the Brisbane to Adelaide air race, 1936.jpg|thumb|Ivy May Pearce and Jason Hassard before taking off for the Brisbane to Adelaide air race, 1936]]Described as "one of the countries first aerobatic pilots" (Dwyer, N. 1998) and an [[aviatrix]], in 1934 Pearce was runner up in ''[[The Courier-Mail]]'' Flying Scholarship behind the winner [[Harry Poulsen]]. Pearce "was the only female among five males who scored free lessons and a year's membership to the Aero Club" (Clare Mackenzie, 1993). Due to there being no other female pilots, let alone ones who could do loops in the air and were only 18 years of age, she had trouble finding a willing passenger. Brisbane Catholic Archbishop [[James Duhig]] volunteered to be the first passenger on a flight from Brisbane's [[Archerfield Airport]] to Ipswich on 4 September 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article35943004|title=AIRWOMAN'S FIRST PASSENGER|date=5 September 1935|newspaper=[[The Courier-Mail]]|accessdate=19 January 2018|issue=630|location=Brisbane|page=12|via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards Duhig reported that Pearce had handled the plane admirably and that the machine was perfectly steady through the flight with the turns almost imperceptible.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article181216945|title=GIRL PILOT'S FIRST PASSENGER|last=|first=|date=5 September 1935|newspaper=[[The Telegraph (Brisbane)|The Telegraph]]|accessdate=19 January 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|location=Brisbane|page=2|edition=LATE CITY|via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pearce once said "I've never been absolutely sure whether he put his faith in me or the Almighty on that occasion". Her father was her passenger for her second flight.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
[[File:Wedding cake for aviators Ivy Pearce and Jason Hassard features a replica of the groom's monoplane, 1937.jpg|thumb|Wedding cake with replica monoplane, 12 June 1937]]
She competed in the 16 December 1936 [[Brisbane]] to [[Adelaide]] air race. Pearce made national headlines as the youngest entrant who recorded the fastest time of any woman pilot, heavily handicapped and just two seconds behind the eventual winner. She beat [[Reg Ansett]], founder of [[Ansett Australia|Ansett Airlines]] (Mackenzie (1993)).

Pearce's navigator in the Brisband to Adelaide race was Ernest Jason Hassard (nephew of aviator [[Keith Virtue]]). A few days after the race they announced their engagement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article47773295|title=Air Race Pilot And Navigator To Marry|date=29 December 1936|newspaper=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]]|accessdate=19 January 2018|location=Adelaide|page=11|via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aged 23, Pearce married Jason Hassard on Saturday 12 June 1937 in [[St John's Cathedral (Brisbane)|St John's Cathedral]] in Brisbane. Jason Hassard was also a pilot. As the bride and groom left the cathedral, three female pilots flew low in formation over the cathedral. On top of the wedding cake at the reception at [[Rowes Building|Rowes Cafe]] was a tiny replica of a monoplane being flown by Jason Hassard. Their honeymoon was spent touring New South Wales by car and aeroplane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article97886343|title=GIRLS FLY OVER CATHEDRAL WEDDING|last=|first=|date=13 June 1937|newspaper=[[Sunday Mail (Brisbane)|Sunday Mail]]|accessdate=19 January 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|issue=373|location=Queensland, Australia|page=21|via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fashion ==
[[File:Ivy Hassard and John Dolby, partners in fashion design, Gold Coast, 1954.jpg|thumb|Ivy Hassard and John Dolby, partners in a Gold Coast fashion business, discuss a design, 1954]]
In 1946 Pearce opened the first fashion boutique on the Gold Coast. She used her own design and later organised fashion parades for the region, being some of the first fashion parades for that area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article229712814 |title=Women's News Fashion and Gossip |newspaper=[[The Sun (Sydney)|The Sun]] |issue=13835 |location=Sydney |date=16 June 1954 |accessdate=18 January 2018 |page=41|edition=LATE FINAL EXTRA |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article226326576 |title=FASHION SHOW AT S. PARADISE |newspaper=[[South Coast Bulletin]] |volume=, |issue=1642 |location=Queensland, Australia |date=11 August 1954 |accessdate=18 January 2018 |page=8 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1950s she opened a beauty salon called 'Jollie Madame', named after her favourite perfume. By this time she had three children. Her marriage to Jason ended in 1950.

A fashion parade in August 1954, featuring the designs of Pearce (now Hassard) and business partner John Dolby, was marred by the discovery that others in the fashion industry in the audience were using [[spy camera]]s to photograph the designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article229172789|title=Women's News and Gossip|date=10 August 1954|newspaper=[[The Sun (Sydney)|The Sun]]|accessdate=19 January 2018|issue=13,882|location=Sydney|page=33|edition=LATE FINAL EXTRA|via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1960s Pearce opened her third boutique, 'Ivy Hassard Fashions', which used to be at the ANA hotel site.

== Later life ==
Due to her lung condition, she was not expected to live to child bearing age. She defied medical authorities and survived to be 84. On 26 April 1998 Ivy Pearce died, the lung condition finally claiming her life, leaving behind three children and numerous grandchildren.

When her ex-husband Jason Hassard retired, he had completed 36,695 flying hours (the 2nd highest in the world).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.saam.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SAAMTrophiesApr131917.pdf|title=Significant aviator, aircraft &amp; aviation events profiles|last=|first=|date=|website=[[South Australian Aviation Museum]]|page=11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180118140734/http://www.saam.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SAAMTrophiesApr131917.pdf|archive-date=18 January 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2016, the [[Gold Coast Airport]] opened a new commercial building called the Ivy Pearce Building in her honour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://qldairports.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/QAL-Annual-Report-2015_16.pdf|title=Annual Report 2015/6|last=|first=|date=|website=Queensland Airports Ltd|page=22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180118134639/http://qldairports.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/QAL-Annual-Report-2015_16.pdf|archive-date=18 January 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
