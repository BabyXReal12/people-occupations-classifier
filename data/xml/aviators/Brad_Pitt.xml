Pitt's perceived [[sex appeal]] has been picked up by many sources, including ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'', who named him one of the 25 sexiest stars in film history in 1995.&lt;ref name="fox film" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc brad" /&gt;&lt;ref name="www. foxnews. com"&gt;{{cite news|author=Jeanna Bryner |title=Study: Men With 'Cavemen' Faces Most Attractive to Women |publisher=[[Fox News Channel|Fox News]]|date=August 23, 2007 |accessdate=January 1, 2008 |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,294134,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, Pitt won ''[[People (American magazine)|People]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s [[Sexiest Man Alive]], an accolade he won again in 2000.&lt;ref name="bbc brad"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1003789.stm |title=Brad Pitt 'Sexiest Man Alive' |date=November 2, 2000 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=November 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/06/06/entertainment/main2896111.shtml |title=George Clooney Sizes Up Brad Pitt's Feet |author=Judy Faber |date=June 6, 2007 |publisher=[[CBS News]] |accessdate=November 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pitt appeared on ''[[Forbes]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s annual [[Celebrity 100]] list of the 100 most powerful celebrities in 2006, 2007, and 2008, at No. 20, No. 5, and No. 10 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/2006/06/12/06celebrities_money-power-celebrities-list_land.html|title=The Celebrity 100 |author=Lea Goldman; Kiri Blakeley |date=June 12, 2006 |work=Forbes |accessdate=November 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/lists/2007/53/07celebrities_The-Celebrity-100_Rank.html |title=The Celebrity 100 |date=June 14, 2007 |work=Forbes |accessdate=November 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,365903,00.html |title=Oprah, Tiger Woods, Angelina Jolie Top Forbes' Celebrity 100 List |date=June 12, 2008 |publisher=[[Fox News Channel|Fox News]]|accessdate=May 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, he was listed among the [[Time 100]], a compilation of the 100 most influential people in the world, as selected annually by ''TIME''.&lt;ref name="time 100" /&gt; The magazine credited Pitt with using "his star power to get people to look [to where] cameras don't usually catch".&lt;ref name="time 100"&gt;{{cite news |author=Rebecca Winters Keegan |url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/time100/article/0,28804,1595326_1595332_1616809,00.html |title=Brad Pitt |accessdate=July 11, 2007 |work=TIME}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pitt was again included in the Time 100 in 2009, this time in the Builders and Titans list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1894410_1893837_1894161,00.html |title=Brad Pitt |author=James Carville; Mary Matalin |work=TIME|accessdate=May 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 2005, Pitt's relationship with Angelina Jolie became one of the most reported celebrity stories worldwide. After confirming that Jolie was pregnant in early 2006, the significant media hype surrounding the couple reached what [[Reuters]], in a story titled "The [[Brangelina]] fever," called "the point of insanity".&lt;ref name="fever"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2006/02/06/1139074140202.html |title=The Brangelina Fever |accessdate=September 8, 2008 |date=February 6, 2006 |agency=Reuters |work=The Age |location=Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; To avoid media attention, the couple flew to [[Namibia]] for the birth of their daughter Shiloh, which was described by a paparazzi blog as "the most anticipated baby since Jesus Christ."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Terry Leonard |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/25/AR2006052501187.html |title=Namibia Shielding Pitt and Jolie |accessdate=December 30, 2008 |date=May 25, 2006 |work=The Washington Post |agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, intense media interest greeted the announcement two years later of Jolie's second pregnancy; for the two weeks Jolie spent in a seaside hospital in [[Nice]], reporters and photographers camped outside on the promenade to report on the birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Ben Gruber |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2008/07/15/us-jolie-idUSL1322562520080715 |title=Jolie twins doctor admits to pre-birth pressure |accessdate=December 30, 2008 |date=July 15, 2008 |agency=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2006 global industry survey by [[ACNielsen]] in 42 international markets, Pitt, together with Jolie, was found to be the favorite celebrity endorser for brands and products worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afaqs.com/news/company_briefs/index.html?id=9263_Angelina+Jolie+Brad+Pitt+top+the+charts+as+favourite+celebrity+endorsers:+AC+Nielsen+survey|title=Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt top the charts, as favourite celebrity endorsers|publisher=|accessdate=September 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pitt has appeared in several [[television commercials]]. For the U.S. market, he starred in a [[Heineken Pilsener|Heineken]] commercial aired during the [[Super Bowl XXXIX|2005 Super Bowl]]; it was directed by [[David Fincher]], who had directed Pitt in ''[[Seven (1995 film)|Seven]]'', ''[[Fight Club (film)|Fight Club]]'', and ''[[The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (film)|The Curious Case of Benjamin Button]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Lucy Kaylin |url=https://www.gq.com/entertainment/celebrities/200505/brad-pitt-divorce-hollywood-lucy-kaylin?currentPage=5 |title=American Idol |accessdate=March 22, 2010 |date=June 2005 |work=[[GQ]] |page=5 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5oRqnoPPs?url=http://www.gq.com/entertainment/celebrities/200505/brad-pitt-divorce-hollywood-lucy-kaylin?currentPage=5 |archivedate=March 23, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other commercial appearances came in television spots including [[Honda Integra|Acura Integra]], in which he was featured opposite Russian model [[Tatiana Sorokko]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/gossip/hot-copy-article-1.707366|title=Hot Copy|date=December 22, 1995|publisher=''[[The New York Daily News]]''|accessdate=September 22, 2014|location=New York|first1=Michael|last1=Lewittes|first2=A.J. |last2=Benza}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[SoftBank]], and [[Edwin (clothing brand)|Edwin Jeans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/04/business/media/04japander.html/partner/rssnyt/ |title=For Celebrities, Ads Made Abroad Shed Some Stigma |author=Cate Doty |date=February 4, 2008 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=March 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 2, 2015, the [[minor planet]] 29132 Bradpitt was named in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.minorplanetcenter.net/iau/ECS/MPCArchive/2015/MPC_20150602.pdf | title=Minor Planet Center | publisher=[[International Astronomical Union]] | date=June 2, 2015 | accessdate=September 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
