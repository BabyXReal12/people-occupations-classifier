'''Joseph-Michel Montgolfier''' (26 August 1740 – 26 June 1810) and '''Jacques-Étienne Montgolfier'''  (6 January 1745 – 2 August 1799) were paper manufacturers from [[Annonay]], in [[Ardèche]], France best known as inventors of the '''''Montgolfière'''''-style [[hot air balloon]], globe aérostatique. They launched the first piloted ascent, carrying Étienne. Joseph Michel also invented the self-acting [[hydraulic ram]] (1796), Jacques Étienne founded the first paper-making vocational school and the brothers invented a process to manufacture [[Vellum#Paper vellum|transparent paper]].

==Early years==

The Montgolfier brothers Joseph-Michel and Jacques-Étienne were born into a family of paper manufacturers founded in 1534 in [[Annonay]], in [[Ardèche]], France.&lt;ref name=canson/&gt; Their parents were Pierre Montgolfier (1700–1793) and his wife, Anne Duret (1701–1760), who had 16&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Joseph-Michel and Jacques-Étienne Montgolfier FRENCH AVIATORS|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Montgolfier-brothers|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|accessdate=11 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; children. Pierre Montgolfier established his eldest son, Raymond (1730–1772), as his successor.

Joseph-Michel was the 12th child and was described as a maverick and dreamer ("a typical inventor's temperament") and was impractical in terms of business and personal affairs. Étienne was the 15th child, had a much more even and businesslike temperament and was sent to Paris to train as an architect. After the sudden and unexpected death of Raymond in 1772, he was recalled to Annonay to run the family business. In the subsequent 10 years, Étienne applied his talent for technical innovation to the family business of paper making, which then as now was a high-tech industry. He succeeded in incorporating the latest Dutch innovations of the day into the family mills.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

==Hot air balloon experiments, 1782-84==
===Early balloon experiments, 1782===

Of the two brothers, it was Joseph who was first interested in aeronautics, as early as 1775 he built parachutes, and once jumped from the family house. He first contemplated building machines when he observed laundry drying over a fire incidentally form pockets that billowed upwards.&lt;ref&gt;C.C. Gillispie, ''The Montgolfier brothers and the invention of aviation 1783-1784'', p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;  Joseph made his first definitive experiments in November 1782 while living in [[Avignon]]. He reported some years later that he was watching a fire one evening while contemplating one of the great military issues of the day—an assault on the fortress of [[Gibraltar]], which had proved impregnable from both sea and land.&lt;ref&gt;C.C. Gillispie, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph mused on the possibility of an air assault using troops lifted by the same force that was lifting the embers from the fire. He believed that the smoke itself was the buoyant part and contained within it a special gas, which he called "Montgolfier Gas", with a special property he called levity, which is why he preferred smoldering fuel.

Joseph then built a box-like chamber 1×1×1.3&amp;nbsp;m (3&amp;nbsp;ft by {{convert|3|ft|m|abbr=on}} by 4&amp;nbsp;ft) out of very thin wood, and covering the sides and top with lightweight [[taffeta]] cloth. He crumpled and lit some paper under the bottom of the box. The contraption quickly lifted off its stand and collided with the ceiling. 

Joseph recruited his brother to balloon building by writing, "Get in a supply of taffeta and of cordage, quickly, and you will see one of the most astonishing sights in the world." The two brothers built a similar device, scaled up by three (so 27 times greater in volume). On 14 December 1782 they did their very first test flight, lighting with wool and hay, and the lifting force was so great, that they lost control of their craft. The device floated nearly two kilometers (about 1.2&amp;nbsp;mi) and was destroyed after landing by the "indiscretion" of passersby.&lt;ref&gt;C.C. Gillispie, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, Joseph Michel had a best friend named Hans - Alchemr Girn who owned a pet goat named Patris that Joseph Michel used in further balloon experiments

===Public demonstrations, summer 1783===

[[File:Early flight 02562u (2).jpg|thumb|right|150px|First public demonstration in [[Annonay]], 4&amp;nbsp;June 1783]]
To make a public demonstration and to claim its invention the brothers constructed a globe-shaped balloon of [[hessian (cloth)|sackcloth]] tightened with three thin layers of paper inside. The envelope could contain nearly 790&amp;nbsp;m³ (28,000 cubic feet) of air and weighed 225&amp;nbsp;kg (500&amp;nbsp;lb). It was constructed of four pieces (the dome and three lateral bands) and held together by 1,800 buttons. A reinforcing fish net of cord covered the outside of the envelope.

On 4 June 1783, they flew the balloon at [[Annonay]] in front of a group of dignitaries from the ''États ″particuliers″″''. The flight covered 2&amp;nbsp;km (1.2&amp;nbsp;mi), lasted 10 minutes, and had an estimated altitude of 1,600-2,000&amp;nbsp;m (5,200-6,600&amp;nbsp;ft). Word of their success quickly reached Paris. Étienne went to the capital to make further demonstrations and to solidify the brothers' claim to the invention of flight. Joseph, given his unkempt appearance and shyness, remained with the family. Étienne was ''the epitome of sober virtues ... modest in clothes and manner...''&lt;ref&gt;[[S. Schama]] (1989) [[Citizens. A Chronicle of the French Revolution]], p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt;  

In collaboration with the wallpaper manufacturer [[Jean-Baptiste Réveillon]], Étienne constructed a {{convert|37500|cuft|m3|sing=on}} envelope of taffeta coated with a varnish of [[alum]] for fireproofing.  The balloon was sky blue and decorated with golden flourishes, signs of the [[zodiac]], and suns. The design showed the intervention of Réveillon. The next test was on 11 September from the grounds of ''la [[Folie Titon]]'', close to Réveillon's house.  There was some concern about the effects of flight into the upper atmosphere on living creatures. The king proposed to launch two convicted criminals, but it is most likely that the inventors decided to send a sheep, a duck, and a rooster aloft first.

On 19 September 1783, the ''Aérostat Réveillon'' was flown with the first living beings in a basket attached to the balloon: a sheep called Montauciel ("Climb-to-the-sky"), a duck and a rooster. The sheep was believed to have a reasonable approximation of human physiology. The duck was expected to be unharmed by being lifted and was included as a control for effects created by the aircraft rather than the altitude. The rooster was included as a further control as it was a bird that did not fly at high altitudes. The demonstration was performed at the royal palace in [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]], before King [[Louis XVI of France]] and Queen [[Marie Antoinette]] and a crowd.&lt;ref&gt;C.C. Gillispie, pp. 92–3.&lt;/ref&gt;  The flight lasted approximately eight minutes, covered two miles (3&amp;nbsp;km), and obtained an altitude of about {{convert|1500|ft|m}}. The craft landed safely after flying.

===Piloted flight, autumn 1783===

[[File:1783 balloonj.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A 1786 depiction of the Montgolfier brothers' historic balloon with engineering data. Translated details are available on the image hosting page.]]
Since the animals survived, the king allowed flights with humans. Again in collaboration with Réveillon, Étienne built a {{convert|60000|cuft|m3|sing=on}} balloon for the purpose of making flights with humans.It was about seventy-five feet (23 m) tall and about fifty feet (15 m) in diameter. Réveillon supplied rich decorative touches of gold figures on a deep blue background, including fleur-de-lis, signs of the zodiac, and suns with Louis XVI's face in the center interlaced with the royal monogram in the central section. Red and blue drapery and golden eagles were at the base of the balloon. Étienne Montgolfier was the first human to lift off the Earth, making a tethered test flight from the yard of the Réveillon workshop in the [[Faubourg Saint-Antoine]], most likely on October 15, 1783. A little while later on that same day, physicist [[Pilâtre de Rozier]] became the second to ascend into the air, to an altitude of {{convert|80|ft|m}}, which was the length of the tether.&lt;ref name = Crouch&gt;{{cite book| title = Lighter Than Air| author = Tom Davis. Crouch| pages= 28, 178| publisher= The Johns Hopkins University Press| year = 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Gillispie&gt;{{cite book| author = Charles Gillispie| title = The Montgolfier Brothers, and the Invention of Aviation| pages = 45, 46, 178, 179, 183–185| publisher = Princeton University Press| year = 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Model for a Proposed Monument to Commemorate the Invention of the Balloon MET DP248127.jpg|thumb|left|''Proposed Monument to Commemorate the Invention of the Balloon'' by [[Claude Michel]], ca, 1784.]]
On 21 November 1783, the first free flight by humans was made by [[Pilâtre de Rozier]], together with an army officer, the [[marquis d'Arlandes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Lighter_than_air/Early_Balloon_Flight_in_Europe/LTA1.htm| title = U.S. Centennial of Flight Commission: Early Balloon Flight in Europe| accessdate = 2008-06-04| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080602012700/http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Lighter_than_air/Early_Balloon_Flight_in_Europe/LTA1.htm| archivedate = 2 June 2008| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flight began from the grounds of the [[Château de la Muette]] close to the [[Bois de Boulogne]] park in the western outskirts of Paris. They flew about {{convert|3000|ft|m}} above [[Paris]] for a distance of nine kilometers. After 25 minutes, the balloon landed between the windmills, outside the city ramparts, on the [[Butte-aux-Cailles]]. Enough fuel remained on board at the end of the flight to have allowed the balloon to fly four to five times as far. However, burning embers from the fire were scorching the balloon fabric and had to be daubed out with sponges. As it appeared it could destroy the balloon, Pilâtre took off his coat to stop the fire.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

The early flights made a sensation. Numerous engravings commemorated the events. Chairs were designed with balloon backs, and mantel clocks were produced in enamel and gilt-bronze replicas set with a dial in the balloon. One could buy crockery decorated with naive pictures of balloons.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

In December 1783, father Pierre Montgolfier was elevated to the nobility and the hereditary appellation of '''de Montgolfier''' by King [[Louis XVI of France]].

===Other balloons, competing claims===

Some claim that the hot air balloon was invented about 3 years earlier by the Brazilian/Portuguese priest [[Bartolomeu de Gusmão]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.instituto-camoes.pt/cvc/ciencia/p2.html Reis, Fernando. ''Bartolomeu de Gusmão''.Ciência em Portugal.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070119182148/http://www.instituto-camoes.pt/CVC/ciencia/p2.html |date=19 January 2007 }} Centro Virtual Camões, in Portuguese&lt;/ref&gt; A description of his invention was published in 1709(?) in Vienna, and another one was found in the Vatican in about 1917.&lt;ref&gt;[http://purl.pt/706/3/ Gusmao, Bartolomeu de.] ''{{lang|fr|Reproduction fac-similé d'un dessin à la plume de sa description et de la pétition addressée au Jean V. (de Portugal) en langue latine et en écriture contemporaine (1709) retrouvés récemment dans les archives du Vatican du célèbre aéronef de Bartholomeu Lourenco de Gusmão "l'homme volant" portugais, né au Brésil (1685-1724) précurseur des navigateurs aériens et premier inventeur des aérostats.}}'' 1917 (Lausanne: Impr. Réunies S. A.) {{fr icon}}, {{la icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
However, this claim is not generally recognized by aviation historians outside the Portuguese-speaking community, in particular the [[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale]].

On 1 December 1783, [[Jacques Alexandre César Charles]] rose to an altitude of about 3 km near Paris in a hydrogen filled balloon he had developed.

In early 1784, the Flesselles balloon, named after the unfortunate [[Jacques de Flesselles]], later to be an early casualty at the Bastille, gave a rough landing to its passengers.{{cn|date=July 2017}} 
In June 1784, the [[Gustave (balloon)|Gustave]] (a hot air balloon christened La Gustave in honour of King Gustav III of Sweden's visit to Lyon ) saw the first (singing) female aeronaut, [[Élisabeth Thible]].

==Other Montgolfier inventions==

Both brothers invented a process to manufacture [[Onionskin|transparent paper]] looking like [[vellum]], reproducing the technique of the English, followed by the papermakers Johannot and [[Réveillon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.canson.com/our-history/1777 Our History 1777] Canson, n.d., 2 July 2017&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1796, Joseph Michel Montgolfier invented the first self-acting [[hydraulic ram]], a water pump to raise water for his paper mill at [[Voiron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=de Montgolfier|first=J.M.|title=Note sur le bélier hydraulique, et sur la manière d'en calculer les effets|trans-title=Note on the hydraulic ram, and on the method of calculating its effects|  pages=42–51| url=http://annales.ensmp.fr/articles/1802-1803-1/32-38.pdf|work=Journal des Mines, 13 (73)| language=French| year=1803}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1772, the British clockmaker [[John Whitehurst]] had invented its precursor, the "pulsation engine".  
In 1797, Montgolfier's friend [[Matthew Boulton]] took out a British patent on his behalf. 

In 1816, Joseph Michel's sons obtained a British patent for an improved version of the pump.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example: [https://books.google.com/books?id=dGQ7AQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA405#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "New Patents: Pierre François Montgolfier"] ''The Annals of Philosophy'', '''7''' (41) : 405 (May 1816).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death, the Montgolfier company==
Both brothers were freemasons in [[Les Neuf Soeurs]] lodge in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Dictionnaire de la Franc-Maçonnerie (Daniel Ligou, Presses Universitaires de France, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1799, Etienne de Montgolfier died on the way from Lyon to Annonay.&lt;ref name = "EB"&gt;{{cite web
| url = https://www.britannica.com/biography/Montgolfier-brothers
| title = Joseph-Michel and Jacques-Étienne Montgolfier
| publisher = Encyclopædia Britannica
| accessdate = 2017-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; His son-in-law, Barthélémy Barou de la Lombardière de Canson (1774–1859), succeeded him as the head of the company, thanks to his marriage with Alexandrine de Montgolfier. The company became "[[Canson|Montgolfier et Canson]]" in 1801, then "Canson-Montgolfier" in 1807. In 1810, Joseph-Michel died in Balaruc-les-Bains.&lt;ref name = "EB"/&gt;

The [[Canson|Montgolfier Company]] in Annonay still exists under the name Canson. It produces fine art papers, school drawing papers and digital fine art and photography papers  sold in 150 countries.&lt;ref name=canson&gt;[http://en.canson.com/company/our-values Our Values] Canson, n.d., 2 July 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, the Montgolfier brothers were inducted into the [[International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame]] at the [[San Diego Air &amp; Space Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;Sprekelmeyer, Linda, editor.
