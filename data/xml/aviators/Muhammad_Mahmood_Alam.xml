He was awarded the [[Sitara-e-Jurat]] (''"The star of courage"''), the nation's third highest military award and Bar for his actions during the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965]].

==Early life==
Alam was born on 6 July 1935 to a well-educated family of [[Calcutta]], British India. Born and raised in [[Bengal]], Alam was a fluent [[Bengali language|Bengali]] speaker, however his paternal line was of [[Urdu]]-speaking [[Bihari people|Bihari]] origin; having emigrated from [[Patna]] and settled in the [[Bengal Presidency|Bengal]] province of British India for a long time.&lt;ref name="Nation"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nation.com.pk/national/06-Sep-2013/knowing-mm-alam|title=Knowing MM Alam|work=The Nation|accessdate=8 September 2014|date=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family migrated from Calcutta to eastern Bengal which became [[East Pakistan]] following the formation of Pakistan in 1947.&lt;ref name="Nation"/&gt; It was in East Pakistan, where Alam completed his secondary education, graduating from the Government High School in [[Dhaka]] in 1951. He joined the then RPAF (now PAF) in 1952, being commissioned on 2 October 1953.&lt;ref name="The News International"&gt;[http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-4-166043-Iconic-war-veteran-MM-Alam-passes-away Iconic war veteran MM Alam passes away], [[The News International]]. Retrieved on 19 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Alam's brothers are [[M. Shahid Alam]], an economist and a professor at [[Northeastern University, Boston|Northeastern University]],&lt;ref&gt;Institute for Policy Research &amp; Development, [http://iprd.org.uk/?page_id=30 Advisory Board]; [http://iprd.org.uk/?page_id=6291 Dr. M.

Sajjad Alam]], a particle physicist at [[SUNY Albany]].&lt;ref&gt;Department of Physics&amp;nbsp;– , [http://www.albany.edu/undergraduate_bulletin/department_physics.html M. Sajjad Alam]&lt;/ref&gt;

His family moved to [[West Pakistan]] in around 1971, after the secession of [[East Pakistan]].&lt;ref name="Nation"/&gt; Being the eldest of his 11 siblings, Alam did not marry as he had to assume the responsibilities of the upbringing of his family. Some of his younger brothers became distinguished in various academic careers.&lt;ref name="The News International" /&gt;

==Service with the Pakistan Air Force==

===Indo-Pakistani War of 1965===
{{main|Indo-Pakistani War of 1965}}
Alam was listed on the top of the hall of fame list at the PAF Museum in Karachi. Alam is considered a national hero for Pakistan, most significantly for his service in the war of 1965 when he was posted at [[Sargodha]]. During this war he was involved in various [[dogfight]]s while flying his [[F-86 Sabre]] fighter. Alam's credited kills are as follows:

* 6 September 1965, 1× [[Hawker Hunter]]
** [[Squadron Leader]] Ajit Kumar Rawlley, No. 7 Sqn, [[Killed in action|KIA]] near [[Tarn Taran Sahib|Tarn Taran]].
* 7 September 1965, 5× [[Hawker Hunter]]s
** [[Squadron Leader]] Onkar Nath Kacker, No. 27 Sqn, [[POW]]
** [[Squadron Leader]] [[Ajjamada B Devaiah|A B Devayya]], No. 7 Sqn. (IAF shows him a Mystere Pilot &amp; he belonged to No 1 Squadron)&lt;ref name="Citation"&gt;{{cite web|title=Service Record for Sqn Ldr Ajammada Boppaya Devayya|website=Bharat-Rakshak.com|url=http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/IAF/Database/4810}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 16 September 1965, 1× [[Hawker Hunter]]
** Flying Officer Farokh Dara Bunsha, No. 7 Sqn, KIA, near [[Amritsar]].
Although the figures have been confirmed by some independent sources,&lt;ref name="Polmar"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YlHDyi87AQYC|title=One hundred years of world military aircraft|last1=Polmar|first1=Norman|last2=Bell|first2=Dana|publisher=Naval Institute Press|year=2003|isbn=978-1-59114-686-5|page=354|quote=Mohammed Mahmood Alam claimed five victories against Indian Air Force Hawker Hunters, four of them in less than one minute!

In 1978, when Alam gave speech in Karachi university he told that during the fight he saw a spiritual force coming from the sky.&lt;ref name=Rakshak&gt;[http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/IAF/History/1965War/Chapter5.html 30 Seconds Over Sargodha – The Making of a Myth: 1965 Indo-Pak Air War, Chapter 5] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100207194926/http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/IAF/History/1965War/Chapter5.html |date=7 February 2010 }}, [[Bharat Rakshak]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, Alam was transferred as the Squadron Commander of the first squadron of [[Dassault Mirage III]] fighters procured by the [[Pakistan Air Force|PAF]]. He was removed from staff college over his alleged excessive involvement with Tableeghi Jamat and focusing more on preaching religion instead of carrying out his core responsibilities. In 1982, Alam retired as an [[Air commodore]] and took up residence in [[Karachi]]. Since retiring, Alam had become more deeply interested in religion.

==Death==
The Air Force legend was admitted to Pakistan Naval Station Shifa Hospital in Karachi.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dawn.com/2013/03/18/m-m-alam-passes-away-in-karachi/ M. M. Alam passes away in Karachi], Dawn (newspaper). Retrieved on 19 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Alam died in Karachi on 18 March 2013. He was 77. He was being treated for respiratory problems for 18 months. Alam's funeral prayer was performed at the [[PAF Base Masroor]], where he served some of the significant years of his career. Alam was buried at the Shuhuda (Martyrs) Graveyard, located at PAF Masroor Airbase. Air Chief Marshal Tahir Rafique Butt, Sindh Governor Dr Ishratul Ebad, Air Chief Marshal (Ret.) Farooq Feroz Khan, Sindh corps commander Lt. Gen Ijaz Chaudhry, Pakistan Rangers (Sindh) Director-General Maj. Gen. Rizwan Akhter, Base Commander PAF Base Masroor Air Commodore Usaid ur Rehman, many war veterans of the 1965 war and Alam's closest colleagues attended the funeral. One of the younger brothers of the deceased, Zubair Alam, was also present.&lt;ref name="The News International" /&gt;
