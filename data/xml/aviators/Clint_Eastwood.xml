'''Clinton Eastwood Jr.''' (born May 31, 1930) is an American actor, filmmaker, musician, and political figure. After achieving success in the [[Western (genre)|Western]] TV series ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]'', he rose to international fame with his role as the [[Man with No Name]] in [[Sergio Leone]]'s [[Dollars Trilogy|''Dollars'' Trilogy]] of [[spaghetti Western]]s during the 1960s, and as [[antihero]] cop [[Dirty Harry (character)|Harry Callahan]] in the five ''[[Dirty Harry (film series)|Dirty Harry]]'' films throughout the 1970s and 1980s. These roles, among others, have made Eastwood an enduring [[cultural icon]] of [[masculinity]].&lt;ref name="Fischer, Landy &amp; Smith"&gt;Fischer, Landy &amp; Smith, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kitses, p. 307.&lt;/ref&gt;

For his work in the Western film ''[[Unforgiven]]'' (1992) and the sports drama ''[[Million Dollar Baby]]'' (2004), Eastwood won Academy Awards for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], as well as receiving nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]]. Eastwood's greatest commercial successes have been the adventure comedy ''[[Every Which Way but Loose (film)|Every Which Way But Loose]]'' (1978) and its sequel, the action comedy ''[[Any Which Way You Can]]'' (1980), after adjustment for inflation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Clint Eastwood Movie Box Office Results |publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]] |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/people/chart/?id=clinteastwood.htm |accessdate=January 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other popular films include the Western ''[[Hang 'Em High]]'' (1968), the psychological thriller ''[[Play Misty for Me]]'' (1971), the crime film ''[[Thunderbolt and Lightfoot]]'' (1974), the Western ''[[The Outlaw Josey Wales]]'' (1976), the prison film ''[[Escape from Alcatraz (film)|Escape from Alcatraz]]'' (1979), the action film ''[[Firefox (film)|Firefox]]'' (1982), the suspense thriller ''[[Tightrope (film)|Tightrope]]'' (1984), the Western ''[[Pale Rider]]'' (1985), the war films ''[[Where Eagles Dare]]'' (1968), ''[[Kelly's Heroes]]'' (1970), and ''[[Heartbreak Ridge]]'' (1986), the action thriller ''[[In the Line of Fire]]'' (1993), the romantic drama ''[[The Bridges of Madison County (film)|The Bridges of Madison County]]'' (1995), and the drama ''[[Gran Torino]]'' (2008).

In addition to directing many of his own [[star vehicle]]s, Eastwood has also directed films in which he did not appear, such as the mystery drama ''[[Mystic River (film)|Mystic River]]'' (2003) and the war film ''[[Letters from Iwo Jima]]'' (2006), for which he received Academy Award nominations, the drama ''[[Changeling (film)|Changeling]]'' (2008), and the South African biographical political sports drama ''[[Invictus (film)|Invictus]]'' (2009). The war drama biopic ''[[American Sniper]]'' (2014) set box office records for the largest January release ever and was also the largest opening ever for an Eastwood film.

Eastwood received considerable critical praise in [[France]] for several films, including some that were not well received in the United States.&lt;!--which ones?--&gt; Eastwood has been awarded two of France's highest honors: in 1994 he became a recipient of the [[Commander]] of the [[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres]], and in 2007 he was awarded the [[Legion of Honour]] medal. In 2000, Eastwood was awarded the Italian [[Venice Film Festival]] [[Golden Lion]] for lifetime achievement.

Since 1967, Eastwood has run his own production company, [[Malpaso Productions]], which has produced all but four of his American films. Starting in 1986, Eastwood served for two years as mayor of [[Carmel-by-the-Sea, California]], a non-partisan office.

==Early life==

Eastwood was born on May 31, 1930, in [[San Francisco|San Francisco, California]], the son of Clinton Eastwood Sr. (1906–1970) and Ruth (Runner) Wood (1909–2006). Ruth later took the surname of her second husband, John Belden Wood (1913–2004), whom she married after the death of Clinton Sr.&lt;ref name="McGilligan231"&gt;McGilligan, p. 231&lt;/ref&gt; Eastwood was nicknamed "Samson" by the hospital nurses because he weighed {{convert|11|lb|6|oz|kg}} at birth.&lt;ref name="At80"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/eastwood-at-80-1986872.html|title=Eastwood at 80|last1=Amara|first1=Pavan|last2=Sundberg|first2=Charlotte|date=May 30, 2010|work=[[The Independent]]|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vnYapQvw?url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/eastwood-at-80-1986872.html|archivedate=January 17, 2011|location=London|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian 08"&gt;{{cite news|last=Day|first=Elizabeth|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/nov/02/clint-eastwood-drama|title=Gentle Man Clint|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=November 2, 2008|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vnYkOYuP?url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2008/nov/02/clint-eastwood-drama|archivedate=January 17, 2011|location=London, UK|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has one younger sister, Jeanne Bernhardt (born 1934).&lt;ref name="Eliot14"&gt;Eliot, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Eastwood is of English, Irish, Scottish, and Dutch ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; He is descended from [[Mayflower]] passenger [[William Bradford (Plymouth Colony governor)|William Bradford]], and through this line is the 12th generation of his family born in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mayflowerhistory.com/famous-descendants|title=Famous Descendants|work=MayflowerHistory.com|accessdate=November 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schickel, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zmi12"&gt;Zmijewsky, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

I think that was his major," joked classmate Don Kincaid.&lt;ref name="McGilligan40"/&gt; Another high school friend, Don Loomis, echoed "I don't think he was spending that much time at school because he was having a pretty good time elsewhere."&lt;ref name="McGilligan40"/&gt; "I think what happened is he just went off and started having a good time. I just don't think he finished high school," explained Fritz Manes,&lt;ref name="McGilligan40"/&gt; a boyhood friend two years younger than Eastwood, who remained associated with him until their falling out in the mid-1980s. Biographer [[Patrick McGilligan]] notes that high school graduation records are a matter of strict legal confidentiality.&lt;ref name="McGilligan40"/&gt;

Eastwood held a number of jobs, including as a lifeguard, paper carrier, grocery clerk, forest firefighter, and golf caddy.&lt;ref name="Eliot17"&gt;Eliot, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Eastwood has said that he tried to enroll at [[Seattle University]] in 1951&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Eastwood|first1=Clint|title=Eastwood: In His Own Words|url=http://www.clinteastwood.net/ownwords/|website=ClinteastWood.net|accessdate=July 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but instead was drafted into the [[United States Army]] during the [[Korean War]].&lt;ref name="Eliot1819"&gt;Eliot, pp. 18–19&lt;/ref&gt; "He always dropped the Korean War reference, hoping everyone would conclude that he was in combat and might be some sort of hero. Actually, he'd been a lifeguard at [[Fort Ord]] in northern California for his entire stint in the military," commented Eastwood's former longtime companion, [[Sondra Locke]].&lt;ref name="autobio"/&gt; Don Loomis recalled hearing that Eastwood was romancing one of the daughters of a Fort Ord officer, who might have been entreated to watch out for him when names came up for postings.&lt;ref name="McGilligan49"&gt;McGilligan, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; While returning from a prearranged tryst&lt;ref name="McGilligan49"/&gt; in [[Seattle, Washington]], he was a passenger on a [[Douglas A-1 Skyraider|Douglas AD bomber]] that ran out of fuel and crashed into the ocean near [[Point Reyes]].&lt;ref&gt;Frank (1982), p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schickel, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; Using a life raft, he and the pilot swam {{convert|2|mi|km}} to safety.&lt;ref name="McGilligan50"&gt;McGilligan, p.50&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the CBS press release for ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]'', the [[Universal Studios|Universal]] (known then as Universal-International) film company was shooting in Fort Ord when an enterprising assistant spotted Eastwood and invited him to meet the director.&lt;ref name="McGilligan52"&gt;McGilligan, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; According to Eastwood's official biography, the key figure was a man named Chuck Hill, who was stationed in Fort Ord and had contacts in Hollywood.&lt;ref name="McGilligan52" /&gt; While in Los Angeles, Hill became reacquainted with Eastwood and managed to sneak Eastwood into a Universal studio, where he introduced him to cameraman [[Irving Glassberg]].&lt;ref name="McGilligan52" /&gt; Glassberg arranged for an audition under [[Arthur Lubin]], who, although very impressed with Clint's appearance and stature at 6'4" (193&amp;nbsp;cm), disapproved initially of his acting skills, remarking, "He was quite amateurish. He didn't know which way to turn or which way to go or do anything".&lt;ref name="McGilligan60"&gt;McGilligan, p.60&lt;/ref&gt;  Lubin suggested that he attend drama classes and arranged for Eastwood's initial contract in April 1954, at $100 per week.&lt;ref name="McGilligan60" /&gt; After signing, Eastwood was initially criticized for his stiff manner and delivering his lines through his teeth, a lifelong trademark.&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1954, Eastwood made his first real audition for ''[[Six Bridges to Cross]]'' but was rejected by [[Joseph Pevney]].&lt;ref name="McGilligan63"&gt;McGilligan, p.63&lt;/ref&gt; After many unsuccessful auditions, he was eventually given a minor role by director [[Jack Arnold (director)|Jack Arnold]] in ''[[Revenge of the Creature]]'' (1955), a sequel to the recently released ''[[The Creature from the Black Lagoon]]''.&lt;ref name="McGilligan64"&gt;McGilligan, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1954, Eastwood worked for three weeks on Arthur Lubin's ''[[Lady Godiva of Coventry]]'', won a role in February 1955, playing "Jonesy", a sailor in ''[[Francis in the Navy]]'' and appeared uncredited in another Jack Arnold film, ''[[Tarantula (film)|Tarantula]]'', where he played a squadron pilot.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald &amp; Magers, p. 264&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1955, Eastwood put four hours' work into the film ''[[Never Say Goodbye (1956 film)|Never Say Goodbye]]'' and had a minor uncredited role as a ranch hand (his first western film) in August 1955 with ''Law Man'', also known as ''[[Star in the Dust]]''.&lt;ref name="McGilligan81"&gt;McGilligan, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; Universal presented him with his first television role on July 2, 1955, on [[NBC]]'s ''Allen in Movieland'', which starred comedian [[Steve Allen]], actor [[Tony Curtis]] and swing musician [[Benny Goodman]].&lt;ref name="McGilligan86"&gt;McGilligan, p.86&lt;/ref&gt; Although he continued to develop as an actor, Universal terminated his contract on October 23, 1955.&lt;ref name="Eliot36"&gt;Eliot, p.36&lt;/ref&gt;

Eastwood joined the Marsh Agency, and although Lubin landed him his biggest role to date in ''[[The First Traveling Saleslady]]'' (1956) and later hired him for ''[[Escapade in Japan]]'', without a formal contract Eastwood was struggling.&lt;ref name="McGilligan85"&gt;McGilligan, p.85&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the advice of [[Irving Leonard (financial adviser)|Irving Leonard]], his financial advisor, he changed talent agencies to the Kumin-Olenick Agency in 1956 and Mitchell Gertz in 1957. He landed several small roles in 1956 as a temperamental army officer for a segment of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''Reader's Digest'' series, and as a motorcycle gang member on a ''Highway Patrol'' episode.&lt;ref name="McGilligan85" /&gt; In 1957, Eastwood played a cadet in ''[[The West Point Story (TV series)|West Point]]'' series and a suicidal gold prospector on ''[[Death Valley Days]]''.&lt;ref name="McGilligan87"&gt;McGilligan, p.87&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958, he played a Navy lieutenant in a segment of ''[[Navy Log]]'' and in early 1959 made a notable guest appearance on ''[[Maverick (TV series)|Maverick]]'' opposite [[James Garner]] as a cowardly villain intent on marrying a rich girl for money.&lt;ref name="McGilligan87" /&gt; Eastwood had a small part as an aviator in the French picture ''[[Lafayette Escadrille (film)|Lafayette Escadrille]]'' and played a major role as an ex-renegade of the Confederacy in ''[[Ambush at Cimarron Pass]]'', a film which Eastwood viewed disastrously and professes to be the lowest point of his career.&lt;ref&gt;Frayling, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien (1996), p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McGilligan93"&gt;McGilligan, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Clint Eastwood-Rawhide publicity.JPG|thumb|right|Publicity photo for ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]'', 1961]]
In 1958, Eastwood was cast as Rowdy Yates for the CBS hour-long western series ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]'', the breakthrough in his career he had long been searching for.&lt;ref name="McGilligan95"&gt;McGilligan, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eliot45"&gt;Eliot, p.45&lt;/ref&gt; However, Eastwood was not especially happy with his character; Eastwood was almost 30, and Rowdy was too young and too cloddish for Clint to feel comfortable with the part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Miller, Kenneth|url=http://www.readersdigest.com.au/content/rd-face-to-face-clint-eastwood/|title=RD Face to Face: Clint Eastwood|publisher=Reader's Digest Australia|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080726195125/http://www.readersdigest.com.au/content/rd-face-to-face-clint-eastwood/|archivedate=July 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Filming began in Arizona in the summer of 1958.&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien (1996), p.29&lt;/ref&gt; It took just three weeks for ''Rawhide'' to reach the top 20 in TV ratings and although it never won an [[Emmy]], it was a major success for several years, and reached its peak at number six in the ratings between October 1960 and April 1961.&lt;ref name="McGilligan110"&gt;McGilligan, p.110&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Rawhide'' years (1959–65) were some of the most grueling of Eastwood's career, often filming six days a week for an average of twelve hours a day, yet he still received criticism by some directors for not working hard enough.&lt;ref name="McGilligan110" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McGilligan111"&gt;McGilligan, p.111&lt;/ref&gt; By late 1963 ''Rawhide'' was beginning to decline in popularity and lacked freshness in the script; it was canceled in the middle of the 1965–66 television season.&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; Eastwood made his first attempt at directing when he filmed several trailers for the show, although he was unable to convince producers to let him direct an episode.&lt;ref&gt;Emery, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; In the show's first season Eastwood earned $750 an episode. At the time of ''Rawhide''{{'}}s cancellation, he received $119,000 an episode as severance pay.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, p. xxvi&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1960s ===
{{Main|Clint Eastwood in the 1960s}}

In late 1963, Eastwood's co-star on ''Rawhide'', [[Eric Fleming]], rejected an offer to star in an Italian-made western called ''A Fistful of Dollars'', to be directed in a remote region of Spain by the then relatively unknown [[Sergio Leone]].&lt;ref name="McG126"&gt;McGilligan, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Harrison (actor)|Richard Harrison]] suggested Eastwood to Leone because Harrison knew Eastwood could play a cowboy convincingly. Eastwood thought the film would be an opportunity to escape from his ''Rawhide'' image. Eastwood signed a contract for $15,000 in wages for eleven&amp;nbsp;weeks' work, with a bonus of a [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]] automobile upon completion.&lt;ref name="Eliot59"&gt;Eliot, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McG128"&gt;McGilligan, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; Eastwood later spoke of the transition from a television western to ''A Fistful of Dollars'': "In ''Rawhide'' I did get awfully tired of playing the conventional white hat. The hero who kisses old ladies and dogs and was kind to everybody. I decided it was time to be an anti-hero."&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Eastwood was instrumental in creating the [[Man with No Name]] character's distinctive visual style and, although a non-smoker, Leone insisted Eastwood smoke cigars as an essential ingredient of the "mask" he was attempting to create for the loner character.&lt;ref name="McG131"&gt;McGilligan, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Clint Eastwood - 1960s.JPG|thumb|left|As the [[Man with No Name]] in ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'' (1964)]]

''A Fistful of Dollars'' proved a landmark in the development of [[spaghetti Western]]s, with Leone depicting a more lawless and desolate world than traditional westerns, and challenging American stereotypes of a western hero with a morally ambiguous [[antihero]]. The film's success made Eastwood a major star in Italy&lt;ref&gt;Mercer, p. 272&lt;/ref&gt; and he was re-hired to star in ''[[For a Few Dollars More]]'' (1965), the second of the trilogy. Through the efforts of screenwriter [[Luciano Vincenzoni]], the rights to ''For a Few Dollars More'' and the final film of the trilogy (''[[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]]'') were sold to [[United Artists]] for about $900,000.&lt;ref name="McG148"&gt;McGilligan, p. 148&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1966, Eastwood met producer [[Dino De Laurentiis]] in New York City and agreed to star in a non-Western five-part anthology production named ''[[Le Streghe]]'' ("The Witches") opposite De Laurentiis' wife, actress [[Silvana Mangano]].&lt;ref name="McG150"&gt;McGilligan, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; Eastwood's nineteen-minute installment took only a few days to shoot, but his performance did not please the critics, one writing that "no other performance of his is quite so 'un-Clintlike'."&lt;ref name="McG151"&gt;McGilligan, p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; Two months later Eastwood began work on the third ''Dollars'' film, ''The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'', again playing the mysterious Man with No Name. [[Lee Van Cleef]] returned as a ruthless fortune seeker, with [[Eli Wallach]] portraying the cunning Mexican bandit Tuco Ramirez. The storyline involved the search for a cache of [[Confederate gold]] buried in a cemetery. During the filming of a scene in which a bridge was blown up, Eastwood urged Wallach to retreat to a hilltop. "I know about these things," he said. "Stay as far away from special effects and explosives as you can."&lt;ref name="McG156"&gt;McGillagan, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; Minutes later confusion among the crew over the word "Vaya!" resulted in a premature explosion that could have killed Wallach.&lt;ref name="McG156" /&gt;

{{quote|I wanted to play it with an economy of words and create this whole feeling through attitude and movement. It was just the kind of character I had envisioned for a long time, keep to the mystery and allude to what happened in the past. It came about after the frustration of doing ''Rawhide'' for so long. I felt the less he said, the stronger he became and the more he grew in the imagination of the audience.|source=Eastwood, on playing the Man with No Name character&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The ''Dollars'' trilogy was not released in the United States until 1967, when ''A Fistful of Dollars'' opened on January 18, followed by ''For a Few Dollars More'' on May 10, and ''The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'' on December 29.&lt;ref name="McG157"&gt;McGilligan, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; All the films were commercially successful, particularly ''The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'', which eventually earned $8&amp;nbsp;million in rental earnings and turned Eastwood into a major film star.&lt;ref name="McG157" /&gt; All three films received bad reviews, and marked the beginning of a battle for Eastwood to win American film critics' respect.&lt;ref name="McG158"&gt;McGilligan, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; [[Judith Crist]] described ''A Fistful of Dollars'' as "cheapjack,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Crist|first=Judith|title=Plain Murder All the Way|work=[[New York World Journal Tribune]]|date=February 2, 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; while ''[[Newsweek]]'' considered ''For a Few Dollars More'' as "excruciatingly dopey."&lt;ref name="McG158" /&gt; [[Renata Adler]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said ''The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'' was "...the most expensive, pious and repellent movie in the history of its peculiar genre."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Adler|first=Renata|title=The Screen:Zane Grey Meets the Marquis de Sade|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1968/01/25/archives/the-screen-zane-grey-meets-the-marquis-de-sade-the-good-the-bad-and.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=January 25, 1968|accessdate=January 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine drew attention to the film's wooden acting, especially on the part of Eastwood, though a few critics such as [[Vincent Canby]] and [[Bosley Crowther]] of ''The New York Times'' praised Eastwood's coolness in playing the tall, lone stranger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Crowther|first=Bosley|title=A Fistful of Dollars (1964)|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1967/02/02/archives/screen-a-fistful-of-dollars-opens-western-film-cliches-all-used-in.html?sq=A+Fistful+of+Dollars&amp;scp=1&amp;st=p|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=February 2, 1967|accessdate=January 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leone's cinematography was widely acclaimed, even by critics who disparaged the acting in the film.&lt;ref name="McG158" /&gt;

Stardom brought more roles for Eastwood. He signed to star in the American revisionist western ''[[Hang 'Em High]]'' (1968), featured alongside [[Inger Stevens]], [[Pat Hingle]], [[Dennis Hopper]], [[Ed Begley]], [[Alan Hale, Jr.|Alan Hale]], [[Ben Johnson (actor)|Ben Johnson]], [[Bruce Dern]], and [[James MacArthur]],&lt;ref name="McG159"&gt;McGilligan, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; playing a man who takes up a Marshal's badge and seeks revenge as a lawman after being lynched by vigilantes and left for dead.&lt;ref name="McG160"&gt;McGilligan, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; The film earned Eastwood a fee of $400,000 and 25&amp;nbsp;percent of its net box-office takings.&lt;ref name="McG159" /&gt; Using money earned from the ''Dollars'' trilogy, accountant and Eastwood advisor Irving Leonard helped establish Eastwood's own production company, [[Malpaso Productions]], named after [[Malpaso Creek]] on Eastwood's property in [[Monterey County, California]]. As recently as a month prior to the film's release, 38-year-old Eastwood was still a relative unknown; in July 1968, syndicated columnist Dorothy Manners noted "The proverbial man in the street is still asking, "Who's Clint Eastwood?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Manners, Dorothy| date=July 14, 1968| title=Italy Made Eastwood A Hollywood Hero| url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/106343899| newspaper=[[The Indianapolis Star]] | location=[[Indianapolis, Indiana]] | page=117 | issn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leonard arranged for ''Hang 'Em High'' to be a joint production with United Artists;&lt;ref name="McG162"&gt;McGilligan, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; when it opened in August 1968, it had the largest opening weekend in United Artists' history. ''Hang 'Em High'' was widely praised by critics, including Archer Winsten of the ''[[New York Post]]'', who described it as, "a western of quality, courage, danger and excitement."&lt;ref name="Zmi12" /&gt;

Before the release of ''Hang 'Em High'', Eastwood had already begun working on ''[[Coogan's Bluff (film)|Coogan's Bluff]]'', about an Arizona deputy sheriff tracking a wanted psychopathic criminal ([[Don Stroud]]) through the streets of New York City. He was reunited with Universal Studios for it after receiving an offer of $1&amp;nbsp;million—more than double his previous salary.&lt;ref name="McG165"&gt;McGilligan, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jennings Lang]] arranged for Eastwood to meet [[Don Siegel]], a Universal contract director who later became Eastwood's close friend, forming a partnership that would last more than ten years and produce five films.&lt;ref name="McG167"&gt;McGilligan, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; Shooting began in November 1967, before the script had been finalized.&lt;ref name="McG169"&gt;McGilligan, p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; The film was controversial for its portrayal of violence.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd and Robinson, p. 417&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Slocum, p. 205&lt;/ref&gt; ''Coogan's Bluff'' also became the first collaboration with Argentine composer [[Lalo Schifrin]], who would later compose the jazzy score to several Eastwood films in the 1970s and 1980s, including the ''Dirty Harry'' films.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Eastwood was paid $750,000 in 1968 for the war epic ''[[Where Eagles Dare]]'',&lt;ref name="McG172"&gt;McGilligan, p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; about a World War II squad parachuting into a [[Gestapo]] stronghold in the alpine mountains. [[Richard Burton]] played the squad's commander, with Eastwood as his right-hand man. Eastwood was also cast as [[Two-Face]] in the [[Batman (TV series)|''Batman'']] television show, but the series was canceled before filming began.&lt;ref name="Eliot83"&gt;Eliot, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

Eastwood then branched out to star in the only [[musical film|musical]] of his career, ''[[Paint Your Wagon (film)|Paint Your Wagon]]'' (1969). Eastwood and [[Lee Marvin]] play gold miners who buy a Mormon settler's less favored wife ([[Jean Seberg]]) at an auction. Bad weather and delays plagued the production, and the film's budget eventually exceeded $20&amp;nbsp;million, which was extremely expensive for the time.&lt;ref name="McG173"&gt;McGilligan, p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; The film was not a critical or commercial success, although it was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture&amp;nbsp;– Musical or Comedy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Paint Your Wagon (1969) |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/37096/Paint-Your-Wagon/details |work=[[The New York Times]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vcZqgkCy?url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/37096/Paint-Your-Wagon/details |archivedate=January 10, 2011 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1970s ===
{{Main|Clint Eastwood in the 1970s}}

In 1970, Eastwood starred with [[Shirley MacLaine]] in the western ''[[Two Mules for Sister Sara]]'', directed by Don Siegel. The film follows an American mercenary, who gets mixed up with a prostitute disguised as a nun, and ends up helping a group of Juarista rebels during the reign of Emperor [[Maximilian I of Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;Frayling, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; Eastwood once again played a mysterious stranger—unshaven, wearing a serape-like vest, and smoking a cigar.&lt;ref&gt;Schickel, p. 226&lt;/ref&gt; Although it received moderate reviews,&lt;ref name="McG182"&gt;McGilligan, p. 182&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kauffman|first= Stanley|title=Stanley Kauffman on Films|work=[[The New Republic]]|date=August 1, 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schickel, p. 227&lt;/ref&gt; the film is listed in ''The New York Times Guide to the Best 1,000&amp;nbsp;Movies Ever Made''.&lt;ref&gt;Canby, Maslin, and Nichols&lt;/ref&gt; Later the same year, Eastwood starred as one of a group of Americans who steal a fortune in gold from the Nazis, in the World War II film ''[[Kelly's Heroes]]'', with [[Donald Sutherland]] and [[Telly Savalas]]. ''Kelly's Heroes'' was the last film Eastwood appeared in that was not produced by his own Malpaso Productions.&lt;ref name="McG184"&gt;McGilligan, p. 184&lt;/ref&gt; Filming commenced in July 1969 [[Filming location|on location]] in [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] and in London.&lt;ref name="McG183"&gt;McGilligan, p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; The film received mostly a positive reception and its anti-war sentiments were recognized.&lt;ref name="McG184" /&gt; In the winter of 1969–70, Eastwood and Siegel began planning his next film, ''[[The Beguiled (1971 film)|The Beguiled]]'', a tale of a wounded Union soldier, held captive by the sexually repressed matron (played by [[Geraldine Page]]) of a Southern girls' school.&lt;ref name="McG185"&gt;McGilligan, p. 185&lt;/ref&gt; Upon release the film received major recognition in France and is considered one of Eastwood's finest works by the French.&lt;ref name="McG190"&gt;McGilligan, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; However, it grossed less than $1&amp;nbsp;million and, according to Eastwood and Lang, flopped due to poor publicity and the "emasculated" role of Eastwood.&lt;ref name="McG189"&gt;McGilligan, p. 189&lt;/ref&gt;

Eastwood's career reached a turning point in 1971.&lt;ref name="McG196"&gt;McGilligan, p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; Before Irving Leonard died, he and Eastwood had discussed the idea of Malpaso producing ''[[Play Misty for Me]]'', a film that was to give Eastwood the artistic control he desired, and his debut as a director.&lt;ref name="McG192"&gt;McGilligan, p. 192&lt;/ref&gt; The script was about a jazz disc jockey named Dave (Eastwood), who has a casual affair with Evelyn ([[Jessica Walter]]), a listener who had been calling the radio station repeatedly at night, asking him to play her favorite song – [[Erroll Garner]]'s ''[[Misty (song)|Misty]]''. When Dave ends their relationship, the unhinged Evelyn becomes a murderous stalker.&lt;ref name="McG193"&gt;McGilligan, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; Filming commenced in [[Monterey]] in September 1970 and included footage of that year's [[Monterey Jazz Festival]].&lt;ref name="McG194"&gt;McGilligan, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; The film was highly acclaimed with critics, such as [[Jay Cocks]] in ''Time'' magazine, [[Andrew Sarris]] in the ''[[Village Voice]]'', and Archer Winsten in the ''New York Post'' all praising the film, as well as Eastwood's directorial skills and performance.&lt;ref name="McG195"&gt;McGilligan, p. 195&lt;/ref&gt; Walter was nominated for a Golden Globe Best Actress Award (Drama), for her performance in the film.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

''[[Dirty Harry]]'' (1971), written by [[Harry Julian Fink|Harry and Rita Fink]], centers on a hard-edged New York City (later changed to San Francisco) [[Police inspector#Municipal police|police inspector]] named [[Harry Callahan (character)|Harry Callahan]] who is determined to stop a psychotic killer by any means.&lt;ref name="McG205"&gt;McGilligan, p. 205&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dirty Harry'' has been described as being arguably Eastwood's most memorable character, and the film has been credited with inventing the "loose-cannon cop" genre.&lt;ref&gt;Mathijs and Mendik, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cardullo, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; Author Eric Lichtenfeld argues that Eastwood's role as Dirty Harry established the "first true archetype" of the action film genre.&lt;ref&gt;Lichtenfeld, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; His lines (quoted above) are regarded by firearms historians, such as Garry James and Richard Venola, as the force that catapulted the ownership of [[.44 Magnum]] revolvers to new heights in the United States; specifically the [[Smith &amp; Wesson Model 29]] carried by Harry Callahan.&lt;ref name="Communications2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hicks|first=Jerry|title=A Line to Remember|work=Orange Coast|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TAQEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA23|accessdate=January 13, 2011|date=March 2003|page=23|issn=0279-0483}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sweeney, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dirty Harry'' achieved huge success after its release in December 1971, earning $22&amp;nbsp;million in the United States and Canada alone.&lt;ref&gt;Schickel, p. 272&lt;/ref&gt; It was Siegel's highest-grossing film and the start of a series of films featuring the character Harry Callahan. Although a number of critics praised Eastwood's performance as Dirty Harry, such as Jay Cocks of ''Time'' magazine who described him as "...giving his best performance so far, tense, tough, full of implicit identification with his character,"&lt;ref name="McG210"&gt;McGilligan, p. 210&lt;/ref&gt; the film was also widely criticized as being [[fascism|fascistic]].&lt;ref&gt;Schickel, p. 273&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schickel, p. 281&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baker, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;

Following [[Sean Connery]]'s announcement that he would not play [[James Bond]] again, Eastwood was offered the role but turned it down because he believed the character should be played by an English actor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Boucher |first=Geoff |title=Clint Eastwood as Superman or James Bond?

During filming, Eastwood suffered symptoms of a bronchial infection and several panic attacks.&lt;ref name="McG219"&gt;McGilligan, p. 219&lt;/ref&gt; ''Joe Kidd'' received a mixed reception, with [[Roger Greenspun]] of ''The New York Times'' writing that it was unremarkable, with foolish symbolism and sloppy editing, although he praised Eastwood's performance.&lt;ref name="GreenNYT"&gt;{{cite news|last=Greenspun|first=Roger|authorlink=Roger Greenspun|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=950DE6D71F31E73BBC4851DFB1668389669EDE|title=Joe Kidd (1972)|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 20, 1972|accessdate=January 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, Eastwood directed his first western, ''[[High Plains Drifter]]'', in which he also starred. The film had a moral and supernatural theme, later emulated in ''Pale Rider''. The plot follows a mysterious stranger (Eastwood) who arrives in a brooding Western town where the people hire him to protect them against three soon-to-be-released felons. There remains confusion during the film as to whether the stranger is the brother of the deputy, whom the felons lynched and murdered, or his ghost. Holes in the plot were filled with black humor and [[allegory]], influenced by Leone.&lt;ref name="McG221"&gt;McGilligan, p. 221&lt;/ref&gt; The revisionist film received a mixed reception, but was a major box office success. A number of critics thought Eastwood's directing was "as derivative as it was expressive," with [[Arthur Knight (film critic)|Arthur Knight]] of the ''[[Saturday Review (US magazine)|Saturday Review]]'' remarking that Eastwood had "...absorbed the approaches of Siegel and Leone and fused them with his own paranoid vision of society."&lt;ref name="McG223"&gt;McGilligan, p. 223&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Wayne]], who had declined a role in the film, sent a letter to Eastwood soon after the film's release in which he complained that, "The townspeople did not represent the true spirit of the American pioneer, the spirit that made America great."&lt;ref&gt;Schickel, p. 291&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Clint Eastwood-Holden-Breezy.jpg|thumb|left|Directing [[William Holden]] in ''Breezy'' (1973)]]

Eastwood next turned his attention towards ''[[Breezy]]'' (1973), a film about love blossoming between a middle-aged man and a teenage girl. During casting for the film Eastwood met [[Sondra Locke]] for the first time, an actress who would play major roles in six of his films over the next ten years and would become an important figure in his life.&lt;ref name="McG229"&gt;McGilligan, p. 229&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kay Lenz]] got the part of Breezy because Locke, at age 29, was considered too old. &lt;!-- by whom?? --&gt;The film, shot very quickly and efficiently by Eastwood and [[Frank Stanley (cinematographer)|Frank Stanley]], came in $1&amp;nbsp;million under budget and was finished three days ahead of schedule.&lt;ref name="McG230"&gt;McGilligan, p. 230&lt;/ref&gt; ''Breezy'' was not a major critical or commercial success and it was only made available on video in 1998.&lt;ref name="McGilligan231"/&gt;

Once filming of ''Breezy'' had finished, Warners announced that Eastwood had agreed to reprise his role as Callahan in ''[[Magnum Force]]'' (1973), a sequel to ''Dirty Harry'', about a group of rogue young officers (among them [[David Soul]], [[Robert Urich]] and [[Tim Matheson]]) in the San Francisco Police Department who systematically exterminate the city's worst criminals.&lt;ref name="McG233"&gt;McGilligan, p. 233&lt;/ref&gt; Although the film was a major success after release, grossing $58.1&amp;nbsp;million in the United States (a record for Eastwood), it was not a critical success.&lt;ref name="Eliot153"&gt;Eliot, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McG236"&gt;McGilligan, p. 236&lt;/ref&gt; ''The New York Times'' critic [[Nora Sayre]] panned the often contradictory moral themes of the film, while the paper's [[Frank Rich]] called it "the same old stuff".&lt;ref name="McG236" /&gt;

In 1974, Eastwood teamed up with [[Jeff Bridges]] and [[George Kennedy]] in the buddy action caper ''[[Thunderbolt and Lightfoot]]'', a road movie about a veteran bank robber Thunderbolt (Eastwood) and a young con man drifter, Lightfoot (Bridges). On its release, in spring 1974, the film was praised for its offbeat comedy mixed with high suspense and tragedy but was only a modest success at the box office, earning $32.4&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="McG241"&gt;McGilligan, p. 241&lt;/ref&gt; Eastwood's acting was noted by critics, but was overshadowed by Bridges who was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]]. Eastwood reportedly fumed at the lack of Academy Award recognition for him and swore that he would never work for United Artists again.&lt;ref name="McG241" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McG240"&gt;McGilligan, p. 240&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Film shoot for The Eiger Sanction in Zurich (10).jpg|thumb|At a film shoot for ''The Eiger Sanction'' (1975)]]

Eastwood's next film ''[[The Eiger Sanction (film)|The Eiger Sanction]]'' (1975) was based on [[Trevanian]]'s [[The Eiger Sanction|critically acclaimed spy novel]] of the same name. Eastwood plays Jonathan Hemlock in a role originally intended for [[Paul Newman]], an assassin turned college art professor who decides to return to his former profession for one last "sanction" in return for a rare [[Pissarro]] painting. In the process he must climb the north face of the [[Eiger]] in Switzerland under perilous conditions. [[Mike Hoover]] taught Eastwood how to climb during several weeks of preparation at [[Yosemite]] in the summer of 1974 before filming commenced in [[Grindelwald]], Switzerland on August 12, 1974.&lt;ref&gt;Schickel, p. 314&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McG244"&gt;McGilligan, p. 244&lt;/ref&gt; Despite prior warnings about the perils of the Eiger the film crew suffered a number of accidents, including one fatality.&lt;ref&gt;Schickel, p. 315&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zmijewsky, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the danger, Eastwood insisted on doing all his own climbing and stunts. Upon release in May 1975 ''The Eiger Sanction'' was marginally successful commercially, receiving $14.2&amp;nbsp;million at the box office, and was received with mixed reviews.&lt;ref name="McG253"&gt;McGilligan, p. 253&lt;/ref&gt; Joy Gould Boyum of the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' dismissed the film as "brutal fantasy".&lt;ref name="McG253" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schickel, p. 316&lt;/ref&gt; Eastwood blamed Universal Studios for the film's poor promotion and turned his back on them to make an agreement with [[Warner Brothers]], through [[Frank Wells]], that has lasted to the present day.&lt;ref name="McG256"&gt;McGilligan, p. 256&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Outlaw Josey Wales]]'' (1976), a western inspired by [[Asa Carter]]'s 1972&amp;nbsp;novel of the same name,&lt;ref name="McG257"&gt;McGilligan, p. 257&lt;/ref&gt; has lead character Josey Wales (Eastwood) as a pro-Confederate guerilla who refuses to surrender his arms after the [[American Civil War]] and is chased across the old southwest by a group of enforcers. The supporting cast included Locke as his love interest and [[Chief Dan George]] as an elderly [[Cherokee]] who strikes up a friendship with Wales. Director [[Philip Kaufman]] was fired by producer Bob Daley under Eastwood's command, resulting in a fine reported to be around $60,000 from the [[Directors Guild of America]]—who subsequently passed new legislation reserving the right to impose a major fine on a producer for discharging and replacing a director.&lt;ref name="McG264"&gt;McGilligan, p. 264&lt;/ref&gt; The film was pre-screened at the [[Sun Valley, Idaho|Sun Valley]] Center for the Arts and Humanities in [[Idaho]] during a six-day conference entitled ''Western Movies: Myths and Images''. Invited to the screening were a number of esteemed film critics, including Jay Cocks and Arthur Knight; directors such as [[King Vidor]], [[William Wyler]], and [[Howard Hawks]]; and a number of academics.&lt;ref name="McG266"&gt;McGilligan, p. 266&lt;/ref&gt; Upon release in the summer of 1976 ''The Outlaw Josey Wales'' was widely acclaimed, with many critics and viewers seeing Eastwood's role as an iconic one that related to America's ancestral past and the destiny of the nation after the American Civil War.&lt;ref name="McG266" /&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] compared the nature and vulnerability of Eastwood's portrayal of Josey Wales with his Man with No Name character in the ''Dollars'' westerns and praised the film's atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19760101/REVIEWS/601010306/1023 |last=Ebert |first=Roger |authorlink=Roger Ebert |title=The Outlaw Josey Wales |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |date=January 1, 1976 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100116002157/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F19760101%2FREVIEWS%2F601010306%2F1023 |archivedate=January 16, 2010 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film would later appear in ''Time''{{'s}} "Top 10 Films of the Year".&lt;ref name="McGilligan267"&gt;McGilligan, p. 267&lt;/ref&gt;

Eastwood was then offered the role of [[Benjamin L. Willard]] in [[Francis Ford Coppola|Francis Coppola's]] ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'', but declined as he did not want to spend weeks on location in the Philippines.&lt;ref name="McG268"&gt;McGilligan, p. 268&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kitses, p. 305&lt;/ref&gt; He also refused the part of a platoon leader in [[Ted Post]]'s [[Vietnam War]] film, ''[[Go Tell the Spartans]]''&lt;ref name="McG268" /&gt; and instead decided to make a third ''Dirty Harry'' film, ''[[The Enforcer (1976 film)|The Enforcer]]''. The film had Callahan partnered with a new female officer ([[Tyne Daly]]) to face a San Francisco Bay area group resembling the [[Symbionese Liberation Army]]. The film, culminating in a shootout on [[Alcatraz]] island, was considerably shorter than the previous ''Dirty Harry'' films at 95{{nbsp}}minutes,&lt;ref name="McG273"&gt;McGilligan, p. 273&lt;/ref&gt; but was a major commercial success grossing $100&amp;nbsp;million worldwide to become Eastwood's highest-grossing film to date.&lt;ref name="McG278"&gt;McGilligan, p. 278&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, he directed and starred in ''[[The Gauntlet (film)|The Gauntlet]]'' opposite Locke, Pat Hingle, [[William Prince (actor)|William Prince]], [[Bill McKinney]], and [[Mara Corday]]. Eastwood portrays a down-and-out cop assigned to escort a prostitute from Las Vegas to Phoenix to testify against the [[organized crime|mob]]. Although a moderate hit with the viewing public, critics had mixed feelings about the film, with many believing it was overly violent. Ebert, in contrast, gave the film three stars and called it "...&amp;nbsp;classic Clint Eastwood: fast, furious, and funny."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ebert |first=Roger |authorlink=Roger Ebert |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19770101/REVIEWS/701010304/1023 |title=The Gauntlet |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |date=January 1, 1977 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612184015/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F19770101%2FREVIEWS%2F701010304%2F1023 |archivedate=June 12, 2010 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, he starred in ''[[Every Which Way but Loose (film)|Every Which Way But Loose]]'' in an uncharacteristic offbeat comedy role. He played Philo Beddoe, a trucker and brawler who roams the American West searching for a lost love (Locke) accompanied by his brother (played by [[Geoffrey Lewis (actor)|Geoffrey Lewis]]) and an [[orangutan]] called Clyde. The film proved surprisingly successful upon its release and became Eastwood's most commercially successful film up to that time. Panned by critics, it ranked high among the box office successes of his career and was the second-highest-grossing film of 1978.&lt;ref name="McG302"&gt;McGilligan, p. 302&lt;/ref&gt;

Eastwood starred in ''[[Escape from Alcatraz (film)|Escape from Alcatraz]]'' in 1979, the last of his films directed by Siegel. It was based on the true story of [[Frank Morris (prisoner)|Frank Lee Morris]] who, along with [[John Anglin (criminal)|John]] and [[Clarence Anglin]], escaped from the notorious [[Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary]] in 1962. The film was a major success; [[Stanley Kauffmann]] of ''[[The New Republic]]'' praised it as "crystalline cinema"&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, p. 307&lt;/ref&gt; and Frank Rich of ''Time'' described it as "cool, cinematic grace".&lt;ref&gt;Zmijewsky, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1980s ===
{{Main|Clint Eastwood in the 1980s}}

In 1980, Eastwood directed and played the title role in ''[[Bronco Billy]]'' alongside Locke, [[Scatman Crothers]], and [[Sam Bottoms]].&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, p. 317&lt;/ref&gt; Eastwood has cited ''Bronco Billy'' as being one of the most relaxed shoots of his career and biographer Richard Schickel has argued that Bronco Billy is Eastwood's most self-referential character.&lt;ref&gt;Schickel, p. 362&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schickel, p. 365&lt;/ref&gt; The film was a rare commercial disappointment in Eastwood's career,&lt;ref name="Maslin 1280"&gt;{{cite news|last=Maslin |first=Janet |authorlink=Janet Maslin |title=Any Which Way You Can (1980): Screen: Clint and Clyde |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E03E7DB1339F934A25751C1A966948260 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 17, 1980 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vckh1zY1?url=https://myaccount.nytimes.com/auth/login?URI=http%3A%2F%2Fmovies.nytimes.com%2Fmovie%2Freview&amp;OQ=_rQ3D2Q26resQ3D9E03E7DB1339F934A25751C1A966948260 |archivedate=January 10, 2011 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but was liked by critics. [[Janet Maslin]] of ''The New York Times'' wrote that film was "...the best and funniest Clint Eastwood movie in quite a while", and praised Eastwood's directing, intricately juxtaposing the old West and the new West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Maslin |first=Janet |authorlink=Janet Maslin |title=Bronco Billy (1980): Eastwood Stars and Directs 'Bronco Billy' |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C01E5D61638F932A25755C0A966948260 |date=June 11, 1980 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vckcsP1W?url=https://myaccount.nytimes.com/auth/login?URI=http%3A%2F%2Fmovies.nytimes.com%2Fmovie%2Freview&amp;OQ=_rQ3D2Q26resQ3D9C01E5D61638F932A25755C0A966948260 |archivedate=January 10, 2011 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, Eastwood starred in ''[[Any Which Way You Can]]'', the sequel to ''Every Which Way But Loose''. The film received a number of bad reviews from critics, although Maslin described it as "funnier and even better than its predecessor".&lt;ref name="Maslin 1280" /&gt; Released over the Christmas season of 1980, ''Any Which Way You Can'' was a major box office success and ranked among the top five highest-grossing films of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?yr=1980|title=1980 Yearly Box Office Results at Boxofficemojo.com|accessdate=November 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Eastwood1981.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Eastwood in 1981]]

In 1982, Eastwood directed and starred in ''[[Honkytonk Man]]'', based on the eponymous [[Clancy Carlile]]'s [[Great Depression|depression-era]] novel. Eastwood portrays a struggling western singer Red Stovall who suffers from [[tuberculosis]], but has finally been given an opportunity to make it big at the [[Grand Ole Opry]]. He is accompanied by his young nephew (played by real-life son [[Kyle Eastwood|Kyle]]) to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], where he is supposed to record a song. Only ''Time'' gave the film a good review in the United States, with most reviewers criticizing its blend of muted humor and tragedy.&lt;ref&gt;Schickel, p. 383&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the film received critical acclaim in France, where it was compared to [[John Ford]]'s ''[[The Grapes of Wrath (film)|The Grapes of Wrath]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Schickel, p. 384&lt;/ref&gt; and it has since acquired the very high rating of 93{{nbsp}}percent on Rotten Tomatoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/honkytonk_man|title=Honkytonk Man (1982)|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=May 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year Eastwood directed, produced, and starred in the [[Cold War]]-themed ''[[Firefox (film)|Firefox]]''. Based on a 1977 [[Firefox (novel)|novel with the same name]] written by [[Craig Thomas (author)|Craig Thomas]], the film was shot before but released after ''Honkeytonk Man''. Russian filming locations were not possible due to the Cold War, and the film had to be shot in [[Vienna]] and other locations in Austria to simulate many of the Eurasian story locations. With a production cost of $20&amp;nbsp;million, it was Eastwood's highest budget film to date.&lt;ref name="Schickel378"&gt;Schickel, p. 378&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[People (American magazine)|People]]'' magazine likened Eastwood's performance to "[[Luke Skywalker]] trapped in Dirty Harry's Soul".&lt;ref name="Schickel378" /&gt;

Eastwood directed and starred in the fourth ''Dirty Harry'' film, ''[[Sudden Impact]]'', which was shot in the spring and summer of 1983 and is considered the darkest and most violent of the series.&lt;ref&gt;Zmijewsky and Pfeiffer, p. 232&lt;/ref&gt; By this time Eastwood received 60&amp;nbsp;percent of all profits from films he starred in and directed, with the rest going to the studio.&lt;ref&gt;Munn, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sudden Impact'' was his final on-screen collaboration with Locke. She plays an artist who, along with her sister, was gang-raped a decade before the story takes place and seeks revenge for her sister's now-vegetative state by systematically murdering the rapists. The line "[[Go ahead, make my day]]" (uttered by Eastwood during an early scene in a coffee shop) has been cited as one of cinema's immortal lines. It was quoted by President [[Ronald Reagan]] in a speech to Congress, and used during the [[United States presidential election, 1984|1984 presidential elections]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afi.com/Docs/100Years/quotes100.pdf |title=Frankly, My Dear, I Don't Give A Damn |publisher=[[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5x1HnwHWc?url=http://www.afi.com/Docs/100Years/quotes100.pdf |archivedate=March 8, 2011 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rogin, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; The film was the second most commercially successful of the ''Dirty Harry'' films, after ''The Enforcer'', earning $70&amp;nbsp;million. It received very positive reviews, with many critics praising the feminist aspects of the film through its explorations of the physical and psychological consequences of rape.&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, p. 352&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Tightrope (film)|Tightrope]]'' (1984) had Eastwood starring opposite [[Geneviève Bujold]] in a provocative thriller, inspired by newspaper articles about an elusive Bay Area rapist. Set in [[New Orleans]] to avoid confusion with the ''Dirty Harry'' films,&lt;ref&gt;Schickel, p. 389&lt;/ref&gt; Eastwood played a divorced cop drawn into his target's tortured psychology and fascination for [[sadomasochism]].&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, p. 361&lt;/ref&gt; ''Tightrope'' was a critical and commercial hit and became the fourth highest-grossing [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|R-rated]] film of 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=tightrope.htm |title=Tightrope (1984) |publisher=Box Office Mojo |date=October 23, 1984 |accessdate=July 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eastwood next starred in the crime comedy ''[[City Heat]]'' (1984) alongside [[Burt Reynolds]], a film about a private eye and his partner who get mixed up with gangsters in the [[prohibition]] era of the 1930s. The film grossed around $50&amp;nbsp;million domestically, but was overshadowed by [[Eddie Murphy]]'s ''[[Beverly Hills Cop]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Schickel, p. 400&lt;/ref&gt;

Eastwood made his only foray into TV direction with the 1985 ''[[Amazing Stories]]'' episode ''Vanessa in the Garden'', which starred [[Harvey Keitel]] and Locke. This was his first collaboration with [[Steven Spielberg]], who later co-produced ''[[Flags of Our Fathers (film)|Flags of Our Fathers]]'' and ''[[Letters from Iwo Jima]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Halbfinger |first=David M. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/21/movies/21flag.html |title=The Power of an Image Drives Film by Eastwood |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=September 21, 2006 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uuiqkSBy?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/21/movies/21flag.html?_r=2&amp;ref=movies |archivedate=December 12, 2010 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He would revisit the Western genre when he directed and starred in ''[[Pale Rider]]'' (1985), a film based on the classic 1953&amp;nbsp;western ''[[Shane (film)|Shane]]'' and follows a preacher descending from the mists of the Sierras to side with the miners during the [[California Gold Rush]] of 1850.&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, p. 371&lt;/ref&gt; The title is a reference to the [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]], as the rider of the pale horse is Death, and shows similarities to Eastwood's 1973&amp;nbsp;western ''High Plains Drifter'' in its themes of morality and justice as well as its exploration of the supernatural.&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, p. 375&lt;/ref&gt; ''Pale Rider'' became one of Eastwood's most successful films to date. It was hailed as one of the best films of 1985 and the best western to appear for a considerable period, with [[Gene Siskel]] of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' remarking, "This year (1985) will go down in film history as the moment Clint Eastwood finally earned respect as an artist".&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, p. 378&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, Eastwood co-starred with [[Marsha Mason]] in the military drama ''[[Heartbreak Ridge]]'', about the 1983&amp;nbsp;United States [[invasion of Grenada]]. He portrays a [[United States Marine Corps|United States Marine]] [[Gunnery Sergeant]] veteran of the [[Korean War]] and Vietnam War who realizes he is nearing the end of his military service. Production and filming were marred by internal disagreements between Eastwood and long-time friend and producer Fritz Manes, as well as between Eastwood and the [[United States Department of Defense]] who expressed contempt for the film.&lt;ref name="McG398"&gt;McGilligan, p. 398&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, p. 406&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the film was a commercial rather than a critical success, and has only come to be viewed more favorably in recent times.&lt;ref&gt;Schickel, p. 421&lt;/ref&gt; The film grossed $70&amp;nbsp;million domestically.&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, p. 407&lt;/ref&gt;

Eastwood starred in ''[[The Dead Pool]]'' (1988), the fifth and final film in the ''Dirty Harry'' series. It co-starred [[Patricia Clarkson]], [[Liam Neeson]], and a young [[Jim Carrey]] who plays Johnny Squares, a drug-addled rock star and the first of the victims on a list of celebrities drawn up by horror film director Peter Swan (Neeson) who are deemed most likely to die, the so-called "Dead Pool". The list is stolen by an obsessed fan who, in mimicking his favorite director, makes his way through the list killing off celebrities, of which Dirty Harry is also included. ''The Dead Pool'' grossed nearly $38&amp;nbsp;million, relatively low receipts for a ''Dirty Harry'' film. It is generally viewed as the weakest film of the series, though Roger Ebert thought it was as good as the original.&lt;ref name="The Film journal"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Film journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hAnsAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=May 1, 2011|date=July 1, 1988|publisher=Pubsun Corp.|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ebert1992"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ebert|first=Roger|authorlink=Roger Ebert|title=Roger Ebert's movie home companion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lTshz3206kYC|accessdate=May 1, 2011|year=1992|publisher=Andrews and McMeel|isbn=978-0-8362-6243-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eastwood began working on smaller, more personal projects and experienced a lull in his career between 1988 and 1992. Always interested in jazz, he directed ''[[Bird (1988 film)|Bird]]'' (1988), a biopic starring [[Forest Whitaker]] as jazz musician [[Charlie Parker|Charlie "Bird" Parker]]. Alto saxophonist [[Jackie McLean]] and [[Spike Lee]], son of jazz bassist [[Bill Lee (musician)|Bill Lee]] and a long time critic of Eastwood, criticized the characterization of Charlie Parker remarking that it did not capture his true essence and sense of humor.&lt;ref name="McG433"&gt;McGilligan, p. 433&lt;/ref&gt; Eastwood received two [[Golden Globes]] for the film, the [[Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award|Cecil B. DeMille Award]] for his lifelong contribution, and the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Director|Best Director award]]. However, ''Bird'' was a commercial failure, earning just $11&amp;nbsp;million, which Eastwood attributed to the declining interest in jazz among black people.&lt;ref&gt;Schickel, p. 435&lt;/ref&gt; Carrey would appear with Eastwood again in the poorly-received comedy ''[[Pink Cadillac (film)|Pink Cadillac]]'' (1989). The film is about a [[bounty hunter]] and a group of white supremacists chasing an innocent woman ([[Bernadette Peters]]) who tries to outrun everyone in her husband's prized pink [[Cadillac]]. The film failed both critically and commercially,&lt;ref&gt;Schickel, p. 442&lt;/ref&gt; earning barely more than ''Bird'' and marking a low point in Eastwood's career.&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, p. 437&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1990s ===
{{Main|Clint Eastwood in the 1990s}}

Eastwood directed and starred in ''[[White Hunter Black Heart]]'' (1990), an adaptation of [[Peter Viertel]]'s ''[[roman à clef]]'', about [[John Huston]] and the making of the classic film ''[[The African Queen (film)|The African Queen]]''. Shot on location in [[Zimbabwe]] in the summer of 1989,&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, p. 452&lt;/ref&gt; the film received some critical attention but with only a limited release earned just $8.4&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="McG461"&gt;McGilligan, p. 461&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 1990, Eastwood directed and co-starred with [[Charlie Sheen]] in ''[[The Rookie (1990 film)|The Rookie]]'', a [[buddy cop]] action film. Critics found the film's plot and characterization unconvincing, but praised its action sequences.&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, p. 460&lt;/ref&gt; An ongoing lawsuit, in response to Eastwood allegedly ramming a woman's car,&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, p. 466&lt;/ref&gt; resulted in no Eastwood films being shown in cinemas in 1991.&lt;ref name="McG467"&gt;McGilligan, p. 467&lt;/ref&gt; Eastwood won the suit and agreed to pay the complainant's legal fees if she did not appeal.&lt;ref name="McG467" /&gt;

In 1992, Eastwood revisited the western genre in his film ''[[Unforgiven]]'', a film in which he directed and starred as an aging ex-[[gunfighting|gunfighter]] long past his prime. Scripts existed for the film as early as 1976 under titles such as ''The Cut-Whore Killings'' and ''The William Munny Killings'' but Eastwood delayed the project because he wanted to wait until he was old enough to play his character and to savor it as the last of his western films.&lt;ref name="McG467" /&gt; ''Unforgiven'' was a major commercial and critical success; Jack Methews of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' described it as "the finest classical western to come along since perhaps John Ford's 1956 ''[[The Searchers (film)|The Searchers]]''.&lt;ref name="McG473"&gt;McGilligan, p. 473&lt;/ref&gt; The film was nominated for nine [[Academy Award]]s,&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, p. 475&lt;/ref&gt; (including [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Eastwood and Best Original Screenplay for [[David Webb Peoples]]) and won four, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Eastwood.

Eastwood played Frank Horrigan in the [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] thriller ''[[In the Line of Fire]]'' (1993), directed by [[Wolfgang Petersen]] and co-starring [[John Malkovich]] and [[Rene Russo]]. Horrigan is a guilt-ridden Secret Service agent haunted by his failure to save [[John F.

In 1997, Eastwood directed and starred in the political thriller ''[[Absolute Power (film)|Absolute Power]]'', alongside [[Gene Hackman]] (with whom he had appeared in ''Unforgiven'').

Eastwood directed and starred in ''[[True Crime (1999 film)|True Crime]]'' (1999). He plays Steve Everett, a journalist and recovering alcoholic, who has to cover the execution of murderer Frank Beechum (played by [[Isaiah Washington]]). ''True Crime'' received a mixed reception, with Janet Maslin of ''The New York Times'' writing, "his direction is galvanized by a sense of second chances and tragic misunderstandings, and by contrasting a larger sense of justice with the peculiar minutiae of crime. Perhaps he goes a shade too far in the latter direction, though."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9807EFD61731F93AA25750C0A96F958260|last=Maslin|first=Janet|authorlink=Janet Maslin|title=True Crime|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=March 19, 1999|accessdate=January 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was a box office failure, earning less than half its $55&amp;nbsp;million budget and was Eastwood's worst-performing film of the 1990s aside from ''White Hunter Black Heart'', which had a limited release.&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, p. 539&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Eastwood directed ''[[Hereafter (film)|Hereafter]]'', again working with Matt Damon, who portrayed a psychic.

=== Directing ===

Beginning with the thriller ''Play Misty for Me'', Eastwood has directed over 30 films, including Westerns, action films, and dramas. He is one of few top Hollywood actors to have also become a critically and commercially successful director. ''[[The New Yorker]]''{{'}}s [[David Denby]] wrote that, unlike Eastwood,&lt;ref name="denby20100308"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/03/08/100308fa_fact_denby?currentPage=all|title=Out of the West|work=The New Yorker|date=March 8, 2010|accessdate=September 1, 2012|author=Denby, David}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|quote=John Ford appeared in just a few silent films; Howard Hawks never acted in movies. Clark Gable, Gary Cooper, Spencer Tracy, James Stewart, Cary Grant, Humphrey Bogart, William Holden, Steve McQueen, and Sean Connery never directed a feature. John Wayne directed only twice, and badly; ditto Burt Lancaster. Paul Newman, Jack Nicholson, Warren Beatty, Robert Redford, Robert De Niro, and Sean Penn have directed a few movies each, with mixed commercial and artistic success.}}

From the very early days of his career Eastwood was frustrated by directors' insistence that scenes be re-shot multiple times and perfected, and when he began directing in 1970, he made a conscious attempt to avoid any aspects of directing he had been indifferent to as an actor. As a result, Eastwood is renowned for his efficient film directing and ability to reduce filming time and control budgets. He usually avoids actors' rehearsing and prefers to complete most scenes on the first take.&lt;ref&gt;Munn, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Biskind19697"&gt;Kapsis and Coblentz, pp. 196–197 (interviewer Peter Biskind)&lt;/ref&gt; Eastwood's rapid filmmaking practices have been compared to those of [[Woody Allen]], [[Ingmar Bergman]], [[Jean-Luc Godard]], and the [[Coen brothers]]. When acting in others' films he sometimes takes over directing, such as for ''The Outlaw Josey Wales'', if he believes production is too slow.{{r|denby20100308}} In preparation for filming Eastwood rarely uses [[storyboard]]s for developing the layout of a shooting schedule.&lt;ref name="Gentry65"&gt;Kapsis and Coblentz, p. 65 (interviewer Ric Gentry)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Abb173"&gt;Kapsis and Coblentz, p. 173 (interviewer Denise Abbott)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pascal235"&gt;Kapsis and Coblentz, p. 235 (interviewer [[Pascal Mérigeau]])&lt;/ref&gt; He also attempts to reduce script background details on characters to allow the audience to become more involved in the film,&lt;ref name="Intp678"&gt;Kapsis and Coblentz, pp. 67–68 (interviewer Ric Gentry)&lt;/ref&gt; considering their imagination a requirement for a film that connects with viewers.&lt;ref name="Intp678" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Intp91"&gt;Kapsis and Coblentz, p. 91 (interviewer David Thomson)&lt;/ref&gt; Eastwood has indicated that he lays out a film's plot to provide the audience with necessary details, but not "so much that it insults their intelligence."&lt;ref name="Intp60"&gt;Kapsis and Coblentz, p. 60 (interviewer Ric Gentry)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine, "Eastwood's style is to shoot first and act afterward. He etches his characters virtually without words. He has developed the art of underplaying to the point that anyone around him who so much as flinches looks hammily histrionic."&lt;ref name="Inc1971"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fayard|first=Judy|work=[[Life (magazine)|Life]]|title=Who can stand 32,580 seconds of Clint Eastwood?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OEAEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA44|accessdate=March 8, 2011|date=July 23, 1971|page=46|issn=0024-3019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interviewers Richard Thompson and Tim Hunter note that Eastwood's films are "superbly paced: unhurried; cool; and [give] a strong sense of real time, regardless of the speed of the narrative"&lt;ref name="Intp45"&gt;Kapsis and Coblentz, p. 45 (interviewers Richard Thompson and Tim Hunter)&lt;/ref&gt; while Ric Gentry considers Eastwood's pacing "unrushed and relaxed."&lt;ref name="Intp71"&gt;Kapsis and Coblentz, p. 71 (interviewer Ric Gentry)&lt;/ref&gt; Eastwood is fond of low-key lighting and back-lighting to give his movies a [[Film noir|"noir-ish"]] feel.&lt;ref name="Biskind19697" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Milan143"&gt;Kapsis and Coblentz, p. 143 (interviewer Milan Pavolić)&lt;/ref&gt;

Eastwood's frequent exploration of ethical values has drawn the attention of scholars, who have explored Eastwood's work from ethical and theological perspectives, including his portrayal of justice, mercy, suicide and the angel of death.&lt;ref&gt;Sara Anson Vaux, ''The Ethical Vision of Clint Eastwood'' (Wm.

Eastwood has been recognized with multiple awards and nominations for his work in film, television, and music. His widest reception has been in film work, for which he has received Academy Awards, [[Directors Guild of America Award]]s, Golden Globe Awards, and [[People's Choice Awards]], among others. Eastwood is one of only two people to have been twice nominated for Best Actor and Best Director for the same film (''Unforgiven'' and ''Million Dollar Baby'') the other being [[Warren Beatty]] (''[[Heaven Can Wait (1978 film)|Heaven Can Wait]]'' and ''[[Reds (film)|Reds]]''). Along with Beatty, [[Robert Redford]], [[Richard Attenborough]], Kevin Costner, and [[Mel Gibson]], he is one of the few directors best known as an actor to win an Academy Award for directing. On February 27, 2005, he became one of only three living directors (along with [[Miloš Forman]] and Francis Ford Coppola) to have directed two Best Picture winners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=French |first=Philip |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/feb/25/clinteastwood.oscars |title=Interview: Clint Eastwood, 'I figured I'd retire gradually, just ride off into the sunset&amp;nbsp;...' |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=February 25, 2007 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5w8kkpugi?url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2007/feb/25/clinteastwood.oscars |archivedate=January 31, 2011 |location=London |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 74, he was the oldest recipient of the Academy Award for Best Director to date. Eastwood has directed five actors in Academy Award–winning performances: Gene Hackman in ''Unforgiven'', Tim Robbins and Sean Penn in ''Mystic River'', and Morgan Freeman and Hilary Swank in ''Million Dollar Baby''.

On August 22, 1984, Eastwood was honored at a ceremony at Grauman's Chinese theater to record his hand and footprints in cement.&lt;ref name="Eliot213"&gt;Eliot, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt; Eastwood received the AFI Life Achievement Award in 1996, and received an honorary degree from AFI in 2009.

In early 2007, Eastwood was presented with the highest civilian distinction in France, [[Légion d'honneur]], at a ceremony in Paris. French President [[Jacques Chirac]] told Eastwood that he embodied "the best of Hollywood."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Eastwood receives French honour |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6371461.stm |date=February 17, 2007 |publisher=[[BBC News Online]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uuo2v0vq?url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6371461.stm |archivedate=December 12, 2010 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2009, he was honored by the [[Lumière Award]] (in honor of the [[Auguste and Louis Lumière|Lumière Brothers]], inventors of the [[Cinematograph]]) during the first edition of the [[Lumière Film Festival]] in [[Lyon]], France.

== Personal life ==
{{Main|Personal life of Clint Eastwood}}

Eastwood has had numerous casual and serious relationships of varying length and intensity over his life. Between proposing to and marrying "Maggie" Johnson in 1953, he had an affair that allegedly resulted in a child who was given up for adoption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Munn |first=Michael |title=Clint Eastwood: Hollywood's Loner |publisher=Robson |year=1992 |location=London |isbn=978-0-86051-790-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|19}} He continued having affairs while married to Johnson, including a 14 year long relationship with actress and stunt woman Roxanne Tunis that produced a daughter.&lt;ref name="McG139"&gt;McGilligan, p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="independent2"&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-1259606.html The Good, the Bad and the Ugly] Young, Josh (May 4, 1997).

=== Leisure activities===

Despite smoking in some of his films, Eastwood is a lifelong non-smoker, has been conscious of his health and fitness since he was a teenager, and practices healthful eating and daily [[Transcendental Meditation technique|Transcendental Meditation]].&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oates, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Corliss|first= Richard|title=The Last Roundup|work=Time|date=August 10, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He opened an old English-inspired pub called the Hog's Breath Inn in [[Carmel-by-the-Sea, California|Carmel-by-the-Sea]], [[California]] in 1971.&lt;ref name="McG204"&gt;McGilligan, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt; Eastwood sold the pub and now owns the Mission Ranch Hotel and Restaurant in Carmel-by-the-Sea.&lt;ref name="Him" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.missionranchcarmel.com/ |title=Welcome to Mission Ranch |publisher=Mission Ranch Hotel and Restaurant |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vckpm2bV?url=http://www.missionranchcarmel.com/ |archivedate=January 10, 2011 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spiritual beliefs ===

In 1973, Eastwood told the late film critic [[Gene Siskel]], "No, I don't believe in God."&lt;ref&gt;Gene Siskel, "Clint: The Cynical King who Outdrew the Duke," ''Chicago Tribune'', January 7, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly four decades later while promoting his film, ''[[Hereafter]]'' (2010), Eastwood stated that "I was always respectful of people who were deeply religious because I always felt that if they gave themselves to it, then it had to be important to them. But if you can go through life without it, that’s OK, too. It’s whatever suits you. I do believe in self-help. I’m not a [[New Age]] person but I do believe in meditation, and for that reason I’ve always liked the [[Buddhist]] religion. When I’ve been to Japan I’ve been to Buddhist temples and meditated and I found that rewarding."{{cn|date=June 2018}}

As much as anything, Eastwood has found spirituality in nature (as suggested by his 1985 Western, ''Pale Rider''), stating that "I was born during the Depression and I was brought up with no specific church. We moved every four or five months during the first 14 years of my life, so I was sent to a different church depending on wherever we lived. Most of them were [[Protestant]], but I went to other churches because my parents wanted me to try to figure out things for myself. They always said, ‘I just want to expose you to some religious order and see if that’s something you like’. So although my religious training was not really specific, I do feel spiritual things. If I stand on the side of the Grand Canyon and look down, it moves me in some way."{{cn|date=June 2018}}

"Of course, it would be wonderful to talk with my parents again, who are, of course, deceased. It makes the idea of death much less scary. But then again, if you think that nothing happens after you die, maybe it makes you live life better. Maybe you’re supposed to do the best you can by the gift you’re given of life and that alone"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.showbizspy.com/article/228386/clint-eastwood-on-the-fence-about-god-director-clint-eastwood-discusses-his-religious-beliefs.html|title=SHOWBIZ SPY - OUR SPIES ARE EVERYWHERE!|website=SHOWBIZ SPY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eastwood has been conscious of his health and fitness since he was a teenager, and practices healthful eating habits. As a young man making a name for himself during the production of ''Rawhide'', Eastwood would be featured in magazines and journals, which often documented his health-conscious lifestyle. In the August 1959 edition of ''TV Guide'', for example, Eastwood was photographed doing push-ups. He gave tips on fitness and nutrition, telling people to eat plenty of fruit and raw vegetables, to take vitamins, and to avoid sugar-loaded beverages, excessive alcohol, and overloading on carbohydrates.&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, p.108&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 21, 1970, Eastwood's father died unexpectedly of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]]  at the age of 64.&lt;ref name="McGilligan192"&gt;McGilligan, p.192&lt;/ref&gt; The death, described by Fritz Manes as "the only bad thing that ever happened to him in his life", came as a shock to Eastwood, since his grandfather had lived to be 92. It had a profound impact on Eastwood's life; from then on he became more productive, working with a greater sense of urgency and with more speed and efficiency on set.&lt;ref name="McGilligan193"&gt;McGilligan, p.193&lt;/ref&gt; Although Eastwood had always been a health and fitness enthusiast, he became more so after his father's death. He abstained from hard liquor, adopted a more rigorous health regime, and sought to stay fit.&lt;ref name="McGilligan193" /&gt; However, he still favored cold beer and opened a pub called the Hog's Breath Inn in [[Carmel-by-the-Sea, California|Carmel-by-the-Sea]] in 1971.&lt;ref name="McGilligan204"&gt;McGilligan, p.204&lt;/ref&gt; Eastwood eventually sold the pub and now owns the Mission Ranch Hotel and Restaurant, also located in Carmel-by-the-Sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.missionranchcarmel.com/|title=Welcome to Mission Ranch|publisher=Missionranchcarmel.com|accessdate=April 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, Eastwood publicly proclaimed his participation in [[Transcendental Meditation technique|Transcendental Meditation]] when he appeared on ''[[The Merv Griffin Show]]'' with [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]], the founder of Transcendental Meditation.&lt;ref&gt;Oates (1976), p.17&lt;/ref&gt; He has meditated every morning for years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Corliss, Richard|title=The Last Roundup|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=August 10, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eastwood is an experienced pilot, and sometimes flies his own helicopter to the studio to avoid traffic.&lt;ref&gt;Schickel, p.25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eliot131"/&gt;

Eastwood is an [[audiophile]] and has had a strong passion for music all his life, particularly jazz and country and western music.&lt;ref name="McGilligan114"&gt;McGilligan, p.114&lt;/ref&gt; He dabbled in music early on, and in late 1959 he produced the album ''[[Cowboy Favorites]]'', which was released on the Cameo label.&lt;ref name="McGilligan114" /&gt; The album included some classics such as [[Bob Wills]]'s ''[[San Antonio Rose]]'' and [[Cole Porter]]'s ''[[Don't Fence Me In (song)|Don't Fence Me In]]''. Despite his attempts to plug the album by going on a tour, it never reached the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].&lt;ref name="McGilligan114" /&gt; In 1963, Cameo producer [[Kal Mann]] told him that "he would never make it big as a singer".&lt;ref name="McGilligan115"&gt;McGilligan, p.115&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, during the off season of filming ''Rawhide'', Eastwood and [[Paul Brinegar]]—sometimes joined by [[Sheb Wooley]]—toured rodeos, state fairs, and festivals. In 1962, their act, entitled ''Amusement Business Cavalcade of Fairs'', earned them as much as $15,000 a performance.&lt;ref name="McGilligan115" /&gt; Eastwood has his own [[Warner Bros. Records]]-distributed imprint, Malpaso Records, as part of his deal with Warner Brothers. This deal was unchanged when [[Warner Music Group]] was sold by Time Warner to private investors.&lt;ref name=krall/&gt; 

Eastwood favors [[jazz]] (especially [[bebop]]), [[blues]], classic [[rhythm and blues]], classical, and country-and-western music; his favorite musicians include saxophonists [[Charlie Parker]] and [[Lester Young]], pianists [[Thelonious Monk]], [[Oscar Peterson]], [[Dave Brubeck]], and [[Fats Waller]], and [[Delta blues]]man [[Robert Johnson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Nick|last=Tosches |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2008/12/eastwood200812 |title=Nick Tosches on Clint Eastwood |publisher=Vanity Fair |accessdate=September 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also a pianist and composer.&lt;ref name="McG114"&gt;McGilligan, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; Jazz has played an important role in Eastwood's life from a young age and, although he never made it as a professional musician, he passed on the influence to his son Kyle Eastwood, a successful jazz bassist and composer. Eastwood developed as a boogie-woogie pianist early on and had originally intended to pursue a career in music by studying for a music theory degree after graduating from high school. In late 1959 he produced the album ''Cowboy Favorites'', released on the Cameo label.&lt;ref name="McG114" /&gt;

Eastwood has his own [[Warner Bros. Records]]-distributed imprint Malpaso Records, as part of his deal with Warner Brothers, which has released all of the scores of Eastwood's films from ''The Bridges of Madison County'' onward. Eastwood co-wrote "Why Should I Care" with [[Linda Thompson (singer)|Linda Thompson]] and [[Carole Bayer Sager]], which was recorded by [[Diana Krall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Krall, Eastwood Team For 'crime' |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |publisher=AllBusiness.com |url=http://www.allbusiness.com/retail-trade/miscellaneous-retail-retail-stores-not/4607056-1.html |date=March 11, 1999 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uunYzwbK?url=http://www.allbusiness.com/retail-trade/miscellaneous-retail-retail-stores-not/4607056-1.html |archivedate=December 12, 2010 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
