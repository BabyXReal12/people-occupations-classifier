==Biography==
Conrad was born on January 21, 1903 in [[Winona, Minnesota]],&lt;ref name=solo&gt;[http://soloflights.org/conrad_data_e.html Solo Flights Around the World] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101031094718/http://soloflights.org/conrad_data_e.html |date=2010-10-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where he later attended [[Cotter High School (Winona, Minnesota)|Cotter High School]], graduating in 1921.

In 1929, while Conrad operated Conrad Flying Service, a woman was killed at [[Frontenac, Minnesota]] when she walked into the spinning propeller of Conrad's aircraft. He had jumped out to try and stop her but was himself struck in the head. Conrad took months to recover.&lt;ref name=win2&gt;[http://www.winonadailynews.com/articles/2004/11/13/neighbors/02files.txt "From the Files", ''Winona Daily News'', November 13, 2004]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=win1&gt;[http://www.winonadailynews.com/articles/2005/04/11/news/01max.txt "Biographer exploring flying ace's ups, downs", ''Winona Daily News'', April 11, 2005]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Conrad's students during 1940 was [[Art Donahue|Arthur "Art" Donahue]] who, as a teenager, learned to fly at Conrad Flying Service. After learning how to fly and becoming Minnesota's youngest commercially certificated pilot at the age of 19, Donahue worked for Conrad helping to run the flight school until he left to join the [[Royal Air Force]].&lt;ref name=win4/&gt; He became one of only seven American pilots to fly for the RAF during the [[Battle of Britain]], earned [[Flying ace|ace]] status and was later killed in combat over the [[English Channel]].&lt;ref name=win4&gt;[http://www.winonadailynews.com/articles/2006/11/11/news/03flier11.txt "First hero: St. Charles man an early WWII hero" ''Winona Daily News'', November 11, 2006]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tally&gt;Donahue, Arthur Gerald, ''Tally-Ho! Yankee in a Spitfire'' McMillan &amp; Company, 1942&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cwgc&gt;[http://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/232337 Commonwealth War Graves Commission]&lt;/ref&gt;

Conrad's brother was killed in a plane crash.&lt;ref name=win1/&gt;

On March 24, 1957, Conrad left Logan International Airport for his 25th Atlantic crossing.&lt;ref name=win3&gt;[http://www.winonadailynews.com/articles/2007/03/23/neighbors/02files.txt "From the Files" ''Winona Daily News'', March 23, 2007]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Record flights==

===Flights from Casablanca===
From June 2–4, 1959 Conrad flew [[Piper PA-24 Comanche|Comanche 250]] N110LF non-stop from [[Casablanca]], [[Morocco]] to [[Los Angeles]], a distance of {{convert|7668|mi|km|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=solo/&gt; This distance record (for aircraft in the 1750-3000 kilogram weight class) stood until 1987. With interior seats replaced by fuel tanks, the aircraft was loaded {{convert|2000|lb|kg|abbr=on}} over its production gross weight limit when Conrad took off from Casablanca.

A few months later, on November 24, 1959, Conrad set the record (that still stands) for the 1000–1750&amp;nbsp;kg weight class, flying from Casablanca to [[El Paso, Texas]] in the same aircraft fitted with a smaller engine, with a flight time of 56 hours.&lt;ref name=solo/&gt; At the time he also held the 500–1000&amp;nbsp;kg record, set on his transcontinental Pacer flight in 1952.

===Around-the-world record===
Having chosen a westward route that exceeded the length of the Earth's equatorial circumference, Conrad left [[Miami]] in a PA-23 Aztec named ''New Frontiers'' (registration N4445P) on February 27, 1961 and touched down in Miami on March 8. His average speed was {{convert|123.19|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. He made stops in [[Long Beach, California]], [[Honolulu]], [[Wake Island]], [[Guam]], [[Manila]], [[Singapore]], [[Bombay]], [[Nairobi]], [[Lagos]], [[Dakar]], [[Amapá (city)|Amapa, Brazil]], [[Atkinson Field]] ([[British Guiana]]), [[Port of Spain]] ([[Trinidad]]), and crossed the [[equator]] twice.&lt;ref name=solo/&gt;

Conrad was accompanied by Richard Jennings, an observer for the record flight.

===FAI certified world records===
Conrad set nine official aviation world records (as recognized by the [[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale]] or FAI, the aviation world record adjudicating body).&lt;ref name=fai2/&gt;

==Other flights==

===Vinson Massif controversy===
In 1966, Conrad was involved in a controversial attempt to climb [[Vinson Massif]]. Vinson is the highest mountain in [[Antarctica]], located about {{convert|1200|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the [[South Pole]]. That year, a team of climbers were sponsored to climb the mountain by the American Alpine Club and the National Geographic Society, and supported in the field by the U.S. Navy and the National Science Foundation Office of Antarctic Programs. At the same time, an unauthorized attempt was announced by [[Woodrow Wilson Sayre]], who was planning to fly in a Piper Apache piloted by Conrad with four companions into the Sentinel Range to climb the Vinson Massif. Sayre had a reputation for problematic trips as a result of his unauthorized, unsuccessful, and nearly fatal attempt to climb [[Mount Everest]] from the north in 1962. His unauthorized incursion into [[Tibet]] led [[China]] to file an official protest with the U.S. State Department. However, the attempt did not materialize. Conrad had difficulties with his plane, and according to press reports at the time, he and Sayre were still in [[Buenos Aires]] on the day the first four members of authorized team reached Vinson's summit.

==Awards==
On August 8, 1965, Conrad was named that year's winner of the Harmon International Aviation Trophy, (although the ''New York Times'' indicates that Joan Smith also received the trophy for the flight, the official Harmon Trophy site does not list her).&lt;ref name="nyt1964"/&gt; The Harmon trophies are described by the Clifford B. Harmon Trust as "American awards for the most outstanding international achievements in the arts and/or science of aeronautics for the preceding year, with the art of flying receiving first consideration."&lt;ref&gt;

==Family==
Max and his wife Betty had ten children.
