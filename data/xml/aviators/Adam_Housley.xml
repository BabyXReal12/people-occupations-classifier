He was on air in Kuwait when the first missiles and warning sirens began on March 20, 2003 and earlier that month boarded ships in the Persian Gulf along with U.S. Special Forces as they looked for illegal shipments of weapons into Iraq. His reports also came via video phone from the deck of the U.S.S. Milius, a United States destroyer that would eventually fire the first missiles into Iraq to begin the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/personalities/adam-housley/bio/#s=h-l |title=Adam Housley |publisher=[[Fox News]] |date= |accessdate=2016-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dan |first=By |url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/news-articles/networks-get-ready-war/97693 |title=Networks Get Ready for War &amp;#124; Broadcasting &amp; Cable |website=Broadcastingcable.com |date=2003-02-02 |accessdate=2016-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2005, Housley was one of a few reporters selected to witness the execution of murderer [[Tookie Williams|Stanley "Tookie" Williams]] at San Quentin.&lt;ref name=mjames&gt;Marty James [http://www.napavalleyregister.com/articles/2006/06/30/sports/local/doc44a4971d8c9b9314662562.txt Crushers' Housley a news hound for Fox TV] at ''Napa Valley Register'', Napa, California, June 30, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Housley also reported live on the shooting at the Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), the suspension of New York Yankees third baseman Alex Rodriguez and the aftermath of the deadly crash of Asiana Airlines Flight 214 live from the San Francisco Airport (SFO). Previously, he covered the 2012 wildfires in Waldo Canyon, Colorado &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/personalities/adam-housley/bio/#s=h-l |title=Adam Housley |publisher=Fox News |date= |accessdate=2016-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In April 2013, he secured an exclusive interview with a Special Operations whistle-blower who felt the government betrayed the four men who died in the Benghazi attacks on September 11. 

Adam has reported in eight Latin American countries including [[Nicaragua]], [[Venezuela]], [[Guyana]], [[El Salvador]], [[Colombia]], [[Mexico]], [[Chile]], and [[El Salvador]] reporting on the war against drugs and scoring an exclusive interview with [[Sandinista]] leader [[Daniel Ortega]].

====Notable coverings====
Housley was one of the first correspondents on assignment in Haiti, covering the devastation left in the wake of the earthquake that struck it on January 12, 2010. He wound up using a plug-in mike he found at the Consumer Electronics show the week earlier to record reports shot on his iPhone. Housley and his cameraman, Eric Barnes, were able to turn rescue footage shot by Congressman [[Kendrick Meek]] (D-FL) into broadcast news.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://blog.zap2it.com/kate_ohare/2010/01/fncs-adam-housley-goes-from-gadgets-to-tragedy-in-haiti.html |title=FNC&amp;apos;s Adam Housley Goes From Gadgets in Vegas to Tragedy in Haiti – Zap2It |website=Blog.zap2it.com |date=2010-01-19 |accessdate=2016-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Housley was one of the first Western journalists to provide extensive on-site coverage in the wake of the Southeast Asian tsunami. He reported on recovery efforts and the search for bodies along with his crew on location from Phuket, Patong Beach, Phi Phi Island and Khao Lak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2004/12/30/interview-americares-ceo-curt-welling.html |title=Interview: AmeriCares CEO Curt Welling |publisher=[[Fox News]] |date= |accessdate=2016-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2005/01/05/reporter-notebook-pieces-phuket.html |title=Reporter's Notebook: Pieces of Phuket |publisher=[[Fox News]] |date=2005-01-05 |accessdate=2016-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Housley was one of the first American reporters on scene in Japan to cover the devastation following the 9.0 earthquake and subsequent tsunami. He and his crew at one point got within 70 miles of the reactors, filming live streaming reports for [[Fox News]] before the nuclear threat forced them to return to Tokyo. His coverage was featured in, among others, ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'', ''[[Mediabistro]]'' and ''The Napa Register''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://napavalleyregister.com/news/local/article_e0952672-52b7-11e0-9c77-001cc4c002e0.html|title=Napa native sees ‘history from the front row’|first=JAMES|last=NOONAN|website=Napavalleyregister.com|accessdate=2016-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Chris Ariens |url=http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/shepard-smith-en-route-to-japan-greg-palkots-first-reporting-since-being-attacked-in-egypt_b57198 |title=Shepard Smith en route to Japan; Greg Palkot’s first reporting since being attacked in Egypt &amp;#124; TVNewser |website=Mediabistro.com |date=2011-03-13 |accessdate=2016-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2011/03/japan-earthquake-and-tsunami-coverage-drives-huge-traffic-gains-for-cnn-and-fox-news-.html |title=Japan earthquake and tsunami coverage drives huge traffic gains for CNN and Fox News |website=Latimesblogs.latimes.com |accessdate=2016-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fluent in Spanish, Housley covered the Chilean mining accident for Fox. He was on site and reporting on October 12–13, 2010, as each of the 33 miners, trapped for 69 days, was brought to the surface one at a time in a rescue capsule.&lt;ref name=farrell /&gt;

During the protests in August and November 2014, Housley was one of the reporters for Fox on the scene in [[Ferguson, Missouri]]. He reported live as the fires were still burning on Florissant Avenue, and some of his tweets prompted viewers to donate money to local businesses who lost everything due to looting and subsequent fires caused by arson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/adamhousley/status/537178355465216000|title=Adam Housley |publisher=[[Twitter]]|accessdate=2016-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://twitchy.com/misstripleem-35/2014/11/25/inspirational-reader-sends-check-to-owner-of-ferguson-barber-shop-targeted-by-rioters-photos/ |title=Inspirational: Reader sends check to owner of Ferguson barber shop targeted by rioters [photos&amp;#93; – |website=Twitchy.com |date=2014-11-25 |accessdate=2016-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Housley was one of the first reporters in the world on site for [[2015 San Bernardino attack|the December 2015 terrorist attack]] in San Bernardino. He and his crew obtained exclusive video of the shootout that ended with the gunmen, [[Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik]], being shot and killed by police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEmO4pgiv4Y.|title=Exclusive video of shootout between police, suspects|first=|last=Fox News|date=December 2, 2015|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also broke a number of major developments in the case, including the plan to charge an accomplice, Enrique Marquez Jr., with terror-related offenses,&lt;ref&gt;[https://search.yahoo.com/yhs/search?p=adam%20housley%20and%20san%20bernardino&amp;ei=UTF-8&amp;hspart=mozilla&amp;hsimp=yhs-002] {{dead link|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; federal investigators looking for a missing hard drive,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://video.foxnews.com/v/4713560728001/fbi-searching-for-missing-hard-drive-in-san-bernardino-probe/?#sp=show-clips |title=FBI searching for missing hard drive in San Bernardino probe&amp;#124; Latest News Videos &amp;#124; Fox News |website=Video.foxnews.com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; the FBI knew of terror connections early on,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.breitbart.com/tag/adam-housley/ |title=adam housley Articles |publisher=Breitbart |date= |accessdate=2016-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Farook and Malik practiced at a local gun range.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.foxnews.com/us/2015/12/07/dry-run-san-bernardino-shooter-practiced-at-gun-range-days-before-attack.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
He married ''[[Sister, Sister (TV series)|Sister, Sister]]'' actress and co-host of ''[[The Real (TV series)|The Real]]''  [[Tamera Mowry]] on May 15, 2011. Housley is president of his family's Century Oak Winery in [[Lodi, California]]. The couple welcomed their first child, a son, named Aden John Tanner Housley, on November 12, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/entertainment/2012/11/tamera-mowry-housley-adam-housley-welcome-baby|title=Tamera Mowry-Housley, Adam Housley Welcome Baby|publisher=Abcnews.go.com|date=2012-11-14|accessdate=2012-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It was announced that they were expecting their second child in January 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.essence.com/2015/01/10/real-tamera-mowry-housley-learns-having-girl|title=‘The Real’s Tamera Mowry-Housley Learns She’s Having A Girl On Set|first=Charli|last=Penn|date=10 January 2015|website=Essence./com|accessdate=2016-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple welcomed their second child, a daughter, named Ariah Talea Housley, on July 1, 2015.

The couple competed and won the ''[[Cupcake Wars|Celebrity Cupcake Wars]]'' on [[Food Network]] in 2016. Their jalapeño cornbread, chocolate cabernet, and vanilla port cupcakes beat out three other teams for the title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foodnetwork.com/shows/cupcake-wars/900-series/celebrity-cupcakes-in-space.html/ |title=Celebrity: Cupcakes in Space : Cupcake Wars |publisher=Food Network |date= |accessdate=2016-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Housleys donated their winnings to the charity SnowballExpress.org which helps children of fallen U.S. military members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Chris Ariens |url=http://www.adweek.com/tvnewser/why-fncs-adam-housley-put-on-an-apron-on-tv-last-night/291753/ |title=Why FNC’s Adam Housley Put on An Apron on TV Last Night &amp;#124; TVNewser |website=Adweek.com |date=2016-04-26 |accessdate=2016-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Housley and his wife have received backlash on social media for their marriage, largely focusing on their interracial relationship and also because of his position at Fox News. He has aggressively defended his wife and family with some harsh words for those who levy racially charged insults. In one response, Housley said: "The fact that, in this day and age, we get attacked for our interracial relationship is beyond sad... it is pathetic. Yes I am white. Yes she is half black. Marrying a white man does not erase her color, and marrying a woman who is half black does not mean I am blinded. The problem isn't pigmentation... the problem is backwards, [[bigotry|bigoted]] thought from people who should know better."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediaite.com/tv/fox-reporter-adam-housley-slams-bigoted-and-pathetic-racial-remarks-about-his-interracial-marriage/ |title=Fox’s Adam Housley Slams ‘Bigoted’ and ‘Pathetic’ Racial Remarks About His Interracial Marriage |website=Mediaite.com |date=2014-01-14 |accessdate=2016-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
