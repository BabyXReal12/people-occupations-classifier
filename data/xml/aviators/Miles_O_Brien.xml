'''Miles O'Brien''' (born June 9, 1959) is an independent American [[broadcast journalism|broadcast news]] journalist specializing in science, technology, and [[aerospace]] who has been serving as national science correspondent for ''[[PBS NewsHour]]'' since 2010.

==Early life==
Born in [[Detroit]] and raised in [[Grosse Pointe Farms, Michigan]], O’Brien attended [[Georgetown University]]. In 1982, he was offered and accepted his first broadcasting position with [[WRC-TV]] in Washington, DC. He was later a reporter and anchor at TV stations in Boston, Massachusetts; Tampa, Florida; Albany, New York; and St. Joseph, Missouri. O’Brien joined [[CNN]] in 1992.

He is a third-generation [[general aviation]] pilot. His father, a private pilot, shared his love of flying with him at an early age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Muntean|first=Pete|title=ON AIR An Interview With Newsman Miles O'Brien|url=http://www.pilotmag.com/departments10|accessdate=17 August 2012|newspaper=Pilot Magazine|date=July–August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first flights were in small [[Cessna]]s and [[Piper Aircraft|Pipers]] rented by his father. O'Brien's paternal and maternal grandfathers were also both pilots.

== CNN correspondent and anchor ==

While with CNN in Atlanta and New York, O’Brien served as CNN’s science, space, aviation technology, and environment correspondent. He anchored programs including ''Science and Technology Week,'' ''[[Headline News]],'' ''Primetime,'' ''Live From…(CNN),'' and CNN ''[[American Morning]].''

O’Brien covered all aspects of the [[United States space program]] for CNN including reports on the [[Hubble Space Telescope]], the shuttle dockings at Mir, the first space station launch from [[Kazakhstan]], [[John Glenn]]’s return to space (with broadcast journalist [[Walter Cronkite]]), landings on Mars, the winning of the Ansari X-Prize, and the tragic loss of the [[Space Shuttle Columbia]] and its crew, a story he told to the world in a 16-hour marathon of live coverage. After years of negotiations, [[NASA]] had signed an agreement with CNN that, if not for the disaster, would have made O’Brien the first journalist to fly on a space shuttle. O’Brien followed the investigation and successful return to flight.

In 2000, O’Brien produced, shot and wrote a one-hour documentary on the process of readying a space shuttle for flight: "Terminal Count: What it Takes to Make the Space Shuttle Fly," which aired in May 2001.

A private pilot since 1988, O’Brien also reported extensively on civil aviation issues and crash investigations. O'Brien reported the airliner crashes of [[US Airways Flight 427]], [[ValuJet 592]], [[TWA 800]], [[EgyptAir 990]], [[American Airlines 587]], [[Comair 5191]], [[John F. Kennedy, Jr.]], [[Payne Stewart]], [[Paul Wellstone]], the C-150 incursion into the Washington DC Air Defense Identification Zone, and the [[Cory Lidle]] crash in Manhattan. In the wake of the [[September 11 attacks]], O'Brien provided viewers radar tracks of the hijacked flights while the twin towers were still standing. During the [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq]] invasions, he, along with various retired generals, reported on military aviation techniques and strategy.

His coverage of non-aerospace topics included anchoring ''[[The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer|The Situation Room]],'' covering the [[November 2008 Mumbai attacks|terrorist attack in Mumbai]] on the [[Oberoi Trident]] and [[Taj Mahal Palace &amp; Tower|Taj Mahal]] hotels, as well as several other locations. He also covered [[Hurricane Katrina]] for several weeks, anchoring CNN's [[Peabody Award|Peabody]] and [[Dupont Awards|Dupont Award]]-winning coverage.

O’Brien left CNN in December 2008. He was rehired by CNN as an aviation analyst in March, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Too Much Coverage of Missing Plane?; Interview with Liz Wahl |url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1403/23/rs.01.html |website=CNN |publisher=CNN |accessdate=26 June 2016 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140324035344/http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1403/23/rs.01.html |archivedate=24 March 2014 |date=23 March 2014 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Independent correspondent/journalist==

After leaving CNN, O’Brien formed Miles O’Brien Productions, LLC in Washington, DC. Through this independent company, O’Brien creates stories for numerous outlets including [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]], [[Science Channel|Discovery Science (TV channel)]], [[National Science Foundation]], Spaceflightnow.com, and corporate clients. One of his most notable series productions for PBS was "Blueprint America"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/blueprintamerica/|title=Blueprint America - PBS|work=Blueprint America|accessdate=13 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; that dealt with rebuilding American mass transit infrastructure.

O’Brien joined [https://web.archive.org/web/20100605120509/http://trueslant.com/milesobrien/ "True/Slant"] as a blogger in 2009. He co-founded the Spaceflight Now podcast, "This Week in Space" in 2009, and hosted shows until the shuttles’ retirement in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spaceflightnow.com/|title=Spaceflight Now - The leading source for online space news|work=spaceflightnow.com|accessdate=13 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 2009, O’Brien joined the [[National Science Foundation]] as a correspondent for the “Science Nation” series,&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/news/special_reports/science_nation/producers/obrien.jsp|title=US NSF - Meet the Producers: Miles O'Brien|work=nsf.gov|accessdate=13 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and joined the PBS ''[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]'' produced by [[WGBH-TV]] Boston, as a writer and correspondent.

He worked on the ''Frontline'' documentary, "Flying Cheap"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/flyingcheap/|title=Flying Cheap - FRONTLINE - PBS|work=pbs.org|accessdate=13 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which aired on the one-year anniversary of the [[Colgan Air Flight 3407|Colgan Air plane crash]] in Buffalo, NY. The highly acclaimed documentary featured former [[Colgan Air]] pilots revealing shocking details about some attempts to keep underpaid pilots flying beyond legal limits.

In 2010, O'Brien became a ''[[PBS NewsHour]]'' science correspondent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/author/mobrien/|title=Miles O'Brien|work=PBS NewsHour|accessdate=13 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, O’Brien produced and directed “Mind of a Rampage Killer”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/body/mind-rampage-killer.html|title=NOVA - Mind of a Rampage Killer|work=pbs.org|accessdate=13 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and “Manhunt: Boston Bombers”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/tech/manhunt-boston-bombers.html|title=NOVA - Manhunt—Boston Bombers|work=pbs.org|accessdate=13 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and “Megastorm Aftermath”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/earth/megastorm-aftermath.html|title=NOVA - Megastorm Aftermath|work=pbs.org|accessdate=13 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; for PBS' ''[[Nova (TV series)|Nova]].'' In 2014, he produced and narrated "Why Planes Vanish?" for NOVA, adapted from "Where is Flight MH370" from the [[BBC]] science program [[Horizon]]. He also narrated a recent view after the Fukushima disaster on a new episode of [[Nova]].
