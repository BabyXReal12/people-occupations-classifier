'''Hanna Reitsch''' (29 March 1912&amp;nbsp;– 24 August 1979) was a German [[Pilot (aeronautics)|aviatrix]] and [[test pilot]]. During the Nazi era, she and [[Melitta von Stauffenberg]] flight tested many of the regime's new aircraft.

She set more than 40 [[flight altitude record]]s and women's endurance records in [[gliding]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fai.org/record-gliding |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-09-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316232118/http://www.fai.org/record-gliding |archivedate=16 March 2015 |df=dmy-all }} February 8, 2016 FAI portal{{deadlink|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; before and after World War II. In the 1960s, she was sponsored by the West German foreign office as a technical adviser in Ghana and elsewhere,&lt;ref&gt;Bernhard Rieger, "Hanna Reitsch (1912–1979): The Global Career of a Nazi Celebrity." ''German History'' 26.3 (2008): 383–405.&lt;/ref&gt; and founded a gliding school in [[Ghana]], where she worked for [[Kwame Nkrumah]].

==Early life and education==
Reitsch was born in [[Jelenia Góra|Hirschberg]], [[Province of Silesia|Silesia]] (today Jelenia Góra in [[Poland]]) on 29 March 1912 to an upper-middle-class family. She had a brother, Kurt, and a sister. She began flight training in 1932 at the School of Gliding in [[Jeżów Sudecki|Grunau]].&lt;ref name="reitsch"/&gt;&lt;ref name="reitsch"&gt;Reitsch, Hanna (2009). ''The Sky My Kingdom: Memoirs of the Famous German World War II Test Pilot''. Drexel Hill, Pennsylvania: Casemate Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|14}} While a medical student in Berlin she enrolled in a German Air Mail amateur flying school for powered aircraft at [[Staaken]], in a [[Klemm Kl 25]].&lt;ref name="reitsch"/&gt;{{rp|30,33–34}}

==Career==
===1933–1937===
In 1933, Reitsch left medical school at the [[University of Kiel]] to become, at the invitation of [[Wolf Hirth]], a full-time glider pilot/instructor at [[Hornberg]] in Baden-Württemberg.&lt;ref name="reitsch"/&gt;{{rp|55}} Reitsch contracted with the [[Ufa Film Company]] as a stunt pilot and set an unofficial endurance record for women of eleven hours and twenty minutes.&lt;ref name="reitsch"/&gt;{{rp|59,61,63}} 
In January 1934, she joined a South America expedition to study thermal conditions, along with Wolf Hirth, [[Peter Riedel]] and [[Heini Dittmar]].&lt;ref name="reitsch"/&gt;{{rp|64–65}} While in Argentina, she became the first woman to earn the [[FAI Gliding Commission#Badges|Silver C Badge]], the 25th to do so among world glider pilots.&lt;ref name="reitsch"/&gt;{{rp|75}}

In June 1934, Reitsch became a member of the [[Deutsche Forschungsanstalt für Segelflug]] (DFS) and became a [[test pilot]] in 1935.&lt;ref name="reitsch"/&gt;{{rp|76,101,105}} Reitsch enrolled in the Civil Airways Training School in [[Szczecin|Stettin]], where she flew a twin-engine on a cross country flight and [[aerobatics]] in a [[Focke-Wulf Fw 44]].&lt;ref name="reitsch"/&gt;{{rp|78–87}} 
In 1937, [[Ernst Udet]] gave Reitsch the honorary title of "Flugkapitän" after she had successfully tested [[Hans Jacobs]]' [[Air brake (aeronautics)|divebrakes]] for gliders.&lt;ref name="reitsch"/&gt;{{rp|108–11}}
At the DFS she test flew transport and troop-carrying gliders, including the [[DFS 230]] used at the [[Battle of Fort Eben-Emael]].&lt;ref name="reitsch"/&gt;{{rp|155–156}}

===1937–1945===

In September 1937, Reitsch was drafted in the [[Luftwaffe]] and posted at the testing centre at [[Rechlin-Lärz Airfield]] by [[Ernst Udet]].&lt;ref name="reitsch"/&gt;{{rp|117}}

Her flying skill, desire for publicity, and [[photogenic]] qualities made her a star of [[Nazi propaganda]]. Physically she was petite in stature, very slender with blonde hair, blue eyes and a "ready smile".&lt;ref name="profiles"/&gt; She appeared in Nazi propaganda throughout the late 1930s and early 1940s.&lt;ref name="reitsch"/&gt;{{rp|123}} 

Reitsch was the first female [[helicopter]] pilot and one of the few pilots to fly the [[Focke-Wulf Fw 61|Focke-Achgelis Fa 61]], the first fully controllable helicopter, for which she received the Military Flying Medal.&lt;ref name="reitsch"/&gt;{{rp|119–123}} In 1938, during the three weeks of the International Automobile Exhibition in Berlin, she made daily flights of the Fw 61 helicopter inside the ''[[Deutschlandhalle]]''.&lt;ref name="reitsch"/&gt;{{rp|123}}

In September 1938, Reitsch flew the [[DFS Habicht]] in the Cleveland [[National Air Races]].&lt;ref name="reitsch"/&gt;{{rp|129–138}}

Reitsch was a test pilot on the [[Junkers Ju 87]] ''Stuka'' [[dive bomber]] and [[Dornier Do 17]] [[light bomber|light/fast bomber]] projects, for which she received the Iron Cross, Second Class, from Hitler on 28 March 1941.&lt;ref name=Reitsch&gt;Reitsch, H., 1955, The Sky My Kingdom, London: Biddles Limited, Guildford and King's Lynn, {{ISBN|1853672629}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|166, 170–171}}
Reitsch was asked to fly many of Germany's latest designs, among them the rocket-propelled [[Messerschmitt Me 163]] ''Komet'' in 1942.&lt;ref name=Reitsch/&gt;{{rp|173–174}} A crash landing on her fifth Me 163 flight badly injured Reitsch; she spent five months in a hospital recovering.&lt;ref name="reitsch"/&gt;{{rp|175–179}} Reitsch received the Iron Cross First Class following the accident, one of only three women to do so.&lt;ref name="reitsch"/&gt;{{rp|179}}

In February 1943 after news of the defeat in the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] she accepted an invitation from Col. Gen. [[Ritter von Greim]] to visit the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]. She spent three weeks visiting Luftwaffe units, flying a [[Fieseler Storch|Fieseler Fi 156 ''Storch'']].&lt;ref name="reitsch"/&gt;{{rp|185–187}}

====V-1, 1944====
On 28 February 1944, she presented the idea of Operation Suicide to Hitler at [[Berchtesgaden]], which "would require men who were ready to sacrifice themselves in the conviction that only by this means could their country be saved." Although Hitler "did not consider the war situation sufficiently serious to warrant them...and...this was not the right psychological moment", he gave his approval. The project was assigned to Gen. [[Günther Korten]].&lt;ref name="reitsch"/&gt;{{rp|189,191–193}} There were about seventy volunteers who enrolled in the Suicide Group as pilots for the human glider-bomb.&lt;ref name="reitsch"/&gt;{{rp|193}} By April 1944, Reitsch and Heinz Kensche finished tests of the [[Me 328]], carried aloft by a [[Dornier Do 217]].&lt;ref name="reitsch"/&gt;{{rp|194}} By then, she was approached by [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]-''[[Obersturmbannführer]]'' [[Otto Skorzeny]], a founding member of the ''SS-Selbstopferkommando Leonidas'' ([[Leonidas Squadron]]). They adapted the [[Fieseler Fi 103R Reichenberg|V-1]] into three models, a two-seater, and a single-seater with and without the mechanisms to land.&lt;ref name="reitsch"/&gt;{{rp|195–196}} The plan was never implemented operationally, "the decisive moment had been missed."&lt;ref name="reitsch"/&gt;{{rp|198}}

In her autobiography ''Fliegen, mein Leben'' Reitsch recalled that after two initial crashes with the [[V-1 flying bomb]] she and Heinz Kensche took over tests of the prototype [[Fieseler Fi 103R Reichenberg]]. She made several successful test flights before training the instructors. "Though an average pilot could fly the V1 without difficulty once it was in the air, to land it called for exceptional skill, in that it had a very high landing speed and, moreover, in training it was the glider model, without engine, that was usually employed." &lt;ref name="reitsch"/&gt;{{rp|196–198}} 

In October 1944, she was shown a booklet Peter Riedel had obtained while in the German Embassy in Stockholm, concerning the [[extermination camps|gas chambers]]. She claims she believed it to be enemy propaganda, but agreed to inform [[Heinrich Himmler]] about it. Himmler asked her if she believed it, and she replied, "No, of course not. But you must do something to counter it. You can't let them shoulder this onto Germany." "You are right," Himmler replied.&lt;ref name="reitsch"/&gt;{{rp|184}}

====Berlin, 1945====
[[File:Fieseler Fi156.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Fieseler Fi 156]] ''Storch'' similar to the one Reitsch landed in the [[Grosser Tiergarten|Tiergarten]] near the [[Brandenburg Gate]] during the [[Battle of Berlin]]]]

During the [[Battle of Berlin|last days of the war]], Hitler dismissed [[Hermann Göring]] as head of the Luftwaffe and appointed her lover [[Colonel General#Germany|Generaloberst]] [[Robert Ritter von Greim]] to replace him. Greim and his mistress Reitsch flew from [[Gatow Airport]] into embattled Berlin to meet Hitler in the ''[[Führerbunker]]'', arriving on 26 April as the [[Red Army]] troops were already in the central area of Berlin.&lt;ref name="reitsch"/&gt;{{rp|205–210}} Reitsch landed on an improvised airstrip in the Tiergarten near the [[Brandenburg Gate]].&lt;ref name="reitsch"/&gt;{{rp|206}} Hitler gave Reitsch two vials of poison for herself and von Greim.&lt;ref name="reitsch"/&gt;{{rp|211}} She accepted the capsule.&lt;ref&gt;[[William L. Shirer|Shirer, William L.]], ''[[The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich: A History of Nazi Germany]]'', New York: Simon and Schuster, 1960, {{ISBN|978-0-671-62420-0}}, p. 1454.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the evening of 28 April, Reitsch flew von Greim out of Berlin in an [[Arado Ar 96]] from the same improvised airstrip. This was the last plane out of Berlin.&lt;ref name="reitsch"/&gt;{{rp|203,213}} Von Greim was ordered to get the Luftwaffe to attack the Soviet forces that had just reached [[Potsdamer Platz]] and to make sure [[Heinrich Himmler]] was punished for his treachery in making unauthorised contact with the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]] so as to surrender.&lt;ref&gt;The Luftwaffe order differs in different sources: Beevor states it was to attack Potsdamer Platz, but Ziemke states it was to support General [[Walther Wenck|Wenck's]] [[12th Army (Wehrmacht)|12th Army]] attack (towards Potsdam) – both agree that he was also ordered to make sure Himmler was punished.({{harvnb|Ziemke|1969|p=118}}{{harvnb|Beevor|2002|p=342}})&lt;/ref&gt; Troops of the Soviet [[3rd Shock Army]], which was fighting its way through the [[Tiergarten (park)|Tiergarten]] from the north, tried to shoot the plane down fearing that Hitler was escaping in the plane, but it took off successfully.{{sfn|Ziemke|1969|p=118}}{{sfn|Beevor|2002|p=342}}

====Capture, 1945====
Reitsch was soon captured along with von Greim and the two were interviewed together by U.S. military intelligence officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Hitler's Woman Pilot Seized |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1945/10/10/archives/hitlers-woman-pilot-seized.html |quote=The question whether Adolf Hitler is dead or alive may be answered by the testimony of Hanna Reitsch, woman Luftwaffe pilot, who was in a Berlin bomb shelter with him a few hours before the Russians captured it. She was arrested in the United States zone of occupation today and is being interrogated. |publisher=[[New York Times]] |date=10 October 1945 |accessdate=7 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked about being ordered to leave the ''Führerbunker'' on 28 April 1945, Reitsch and von Greim reportedly repeated the same answer: "It was the blackest day when we could not die at our Führer's side." Reitsch also said: "We should all kneel down in reverence and prayer before the altar of the Fatherland." When the interviewers asked what she meant by "Altar of the Fatherland" she answered, "Why, the Führer's bunker in Berlin&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref&gt;Hans Dollinger with Hans Adolf Jacobsen, tr. [[Arnold Pomerans]], ''The Decline and Fall of Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan: A Pictorial History of the Final Days of World War II'', New York: Crown, [1968], {{OCLC|712594}}, p. 234.&lt;/ref&gt; She was held for eighteen months.&lt;ref name="reitsch"/&gt;{{rp|219}} Greim killed himself on 24 May 1945.

Evacuated from Silesia ahead of the Soviet troops, Reitsch's family took refuge in Salzburg.&lt;ref name="reitsch"/&gt;{{rp|202}} During  the night of 3 May 1945, after hearing a rumour that all refugees were to be taken back to their original homes in the Soviet occupation zone, Reitsch's father shot and killed her mother and sister&lt;ref name="reitsch"/&gt;{{rp|215}} and her sister's three children before killing himself.&lt;ref&gt;Piszkiewicz, Dennis, ''From Nazi Test Pilot to Hitler's Bunker: The Fantastic Flights of Hanna Reitsch'', Praeger Publishers, 1997. {{ISBN|978-0-275-95456-7}}, from [http://personal.georgiasouthern.edu/~etmcmull/HANNA.htm summary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302091709/http://personal.georgiasouthern.edu/~etmcmull/HANNA.htm |date=2 March 2012 }} by Emerson Thomas McMullen, retrieved 8 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===1945–1979===
After her release Reitsch settled in [[Frankfurt am Main]]. Following the war, German citizens were barred from flying powered aircraft, but within a few years [[gliding]] was allowed, which she took up again. In 1952, Reitsch won a bronze medal in the [[World Gliding Championships]] in [[Francoist Spain|Spain]]; she was the first woman to compete.&lt;ref name="reitsch"/&gt;{{rp|220}} and in 1955 she became German champion.&lt;ref name="reitsch"/&gt;{{rp|220}} She continued to break records, including the women's altitude record [{{convert|6848|m|abbr=on}}] in 1957 and her first diamond of the Gold-C badge.&lt;ref name="reitsch"/&gt;{{rp|220}}

During the mid-1950s, Reitsch was interviewed on film and talked about her wartime flight tests of the [[Fw 61|Fa 61]], [[Me 262]], and [[Me 163]]. 

In 1959, Indian Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] invited  Reitsch who spoke fluent English to start a gliding centre, and flew with him over [[New Delhi]].&lt;ref name="reitsch"/&gt;{{rp|220}} 

In 1961, [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[John F. Kennedy]] invited her to the [[White House]].&lt;ref name="reitsch"/&gt;{{rp|221}}

From 1962 to 1966, she lived in [[Ghana]]. [[Kwame Nkrumah]] invited Reitsch to Ghana after reading of her work in India. At Afienya she founded the first black African national gliding school, working closely with the government and the armed forces. The West German government supported her as technical adviser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Phantoms of the Archive: Kwame Nkrumah, a Nazi Pilot named Hanna, and the Contingencies of Postcolonial History-Writing|url=https://academic.oup.com/ahr/article/118/1/104/42008/Phantoms-of-the-Archive-Kwame-Nkrumah-a-Nazi-Pilot | author=Jean Allman | journal=[[American Historical Review]] | date =February 2013 | volume=118 | issue=1 | pages=108 | doi=10.1093/ahr/118.1.104}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The school was commanded by [[JES de Graft-Hayford]], with gliders such as the double-seated Schleicher K7, Slingsby T21, and a Bergfalk, along with a single-seated Schleicher K8.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/16/hitler-pilot-women-fly-ghana |title= Hitler's pilot helped Ghana's women to fly |author= Afua Hirsch |date= 16 April 2012 |newspaper= The Guardian |accessdate= 16 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She gained the [[FAI Gliding Commission#Badges|Diamond Badge]] in 1970.&lt;ref name=obituary&gt;{{cite journal | last = Slater | first = AE | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Obituary | journal = Sailplane &amp; Gliding | volume = 30 | issue = 6 | pages = 302 | publisher = [[British Gliding Association]] | date = December 1979 – January 1980 | url = | doi = | id = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project was evidently of great importance to Nkrumah and has been interpreted as part of a "modernist" development ideology.&lt;ref&gt;Allman, "Phantoms of the Archive: Kwame Nkrumah, a Nazi Pilot named Hanna, and the Contingencies of Postcolonial History-Writing", ''American Historical Review'', vol. 118 no. 1 (Feb. 2013) p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

Reitsch's attitudes to race underwent a change. "Earlier in my life, it would never have occurred to me to treat a black person as a friend or partner&amp;nbsp;..." She now experienced guilt at her earlier "presumptuousness and arrogance".&lt;ref&gt;Reitsch, ''Ich flog für Kwame Nkrumah'' (I flew for Kwame Nkrumah), pp. 29–30, quoted in Allman, "Phantoms of the Archive: Kwame Nkrumah, a Nazi Pilot named Hanna, and the Contingencies of Postcolonial History-Writing", ''American Historical Review'', vol. 118 no. 1 (Feb. 2013) p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; She became close to Nkrumah. The details of their relationship are now unclear due to the destruction of documents, but some surviving letters are intimate in tone.&lt;ref&gt;Allman, "Phantoms of the Archive: Kwame Nkrumah, a Nazi Pilot named Hanna, and the Contingencies of Postcolonial History-Writing", ''American Historical Review'', vol. 118 no. 1 (Feb. 2013) pp. 124–6&lt;/ref&gt;

In Ghana, some Africans were disturbed by the prominence of a person with Reitsch's past, but [[Shirley Graham Du Bois]], a noted African-American writer who had emigrated to Ghana and was friendly towards Reitsch, agreed with Nkrumah that Reitsch was extremely naive politically.&lt;ref&gt;Shirley Graham Du Bois to Nkrumah, 28 June 1965, box 3 file 57, Nkrumah Papers, quoted in Allman, "Phantoms of the Archive: Kwame Nkrumah, a Nazi Pilot named Hanna, and the Contingencies of Postcolonial History-Writing", ''American Historical Review'', vol. 118 no. 1 (Feb. 2013) p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary Ghanaian press reports seem to show a lack of interest in her past.&lt;ref&gt;Allman, "Phantoms of the Archive: Kwame Nkrumah, a Nazi Pilot named Hanna, and the Contingencies of Postcolonial History-Writing", ''American Historical Review'', vol. 118 no. 1 (Feb. 2013) pp. 104–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 1970s, Reitsch broke gliding records in many categories, including the "Women's Out and Return World Record" twice, once in 1976 [{{convert|715|km|abbr=on}}] and again, in 1979, [{{convert|802|km|abbr=on}}] flying along the [[Appalachian mountains|Appalachian Ridges]] in the United States. During this time, she also finished first in the women's section of the first world helicopter championships.&lt;ref name="profiles"&gt;wwiihistorymagazine.com, ''[http://www.wwiihistorymagazine.com/2005/may/col-profiles.html Profiles]'', May 2005, retrieved 6 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

====Last interview, 1970s====
Reitsch was interviewed and photographed several times in the 1970s, towards the end of her life, by Jewish-American photo-journalist Ron Laytner. In her closing remarks she is quoted as saying:

{{quote|And what have we now in Germany? A country of bankers and car-makers. Even our great army has gone soft. Soldiers wear beards and question orders. I am not ashamed to say I believed in National Socialism. I still wear the Iron Cross with diamonds Hitler gave me. But today in all of Germany you can't find a single person who voted Adolf Hitler into power&amp;nbsp;... Many Germans feel guilty about the war. But they don't explain the real guilt we share&amp;nbsp;– that we lost.&lt;ref&gt;Ron Laytner, "The first astronaut: tiny, daring Hanna", ''[[The Deseret News]]'' 19 February 1981, pp. C1+, [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=kz8jAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=TYMDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5612,5305691&amp;dq=i-still-wear-the-iron-cross-with-diamonds-hitler-gave-me-but-today-in-all-germany-you-can-t-find-a-single-person-who-voted-adolf-hitler-into-power&amp;hl=en p. 12C.]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In a little known statement in the same interview, she is quoted as saying, {{quote|I asked Herman Goering one day, "What is this I am hearing that Germany is killing Jews?"
Goering responded angrily, 'A totally outrageous lie made up by the British and American press. It will be used as a rope to hang us someday if we lose the war.'}}

==Death==
Reitsch died in Frankfurt at the age of 67, on 24 August 1979, apparently after a heart attack.

Former British test pilot and [[Royal Navy]] officer [[Eric Brown (pilot)|Eric Brown]] said he received a letter from Reitsch in early August 1979 in which she said,  "It began in the bunker, there it shall end." Within weeks she was dead. Brown speculated that Reitsch had taken the cyanide capsule Hitler had given her in the bunker, and that she had taken it as part of a suicide pact with Greim. No autopsy was performed, or at least no such report is available.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Brown's Book "Wings On My Sleeve – The World's Greatest Test Pilot Tells His Story", pp. 113–114&lt;/ref&gt;
