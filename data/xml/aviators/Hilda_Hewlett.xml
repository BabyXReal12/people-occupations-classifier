'''Hilda Beatrice Hewlett''' (17 February 1864 – 21 August 1943) was an early [[aviator]] and aviation entrepreneur. She was the first British woman to earn a [[pilot's licence]]. She founded and ran two related businesses: the first [[flying school]] in the United Kingdom, and a successful [[Fixed-wing aircraft|aircraft]] manufacturing business which produced more than 800 aeroplanes and employed up to 700 people. She later emigrated to New Zealand.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Hilda Beatrice Hewlett was born in [[Vauxhall]], London on 17 February 1864 to Louisa Herbert née Hopgood and George William Herbert, a [[Church of England]] [[vicar]].&lt;ref name="Census1881"&gt;[[Census in the United Kingdom|1891 Census of Lambeth]], RG11/599, Folio 25, Page 1, Hilda Beatrice Herbert, Parsonage, Lambeth (Father George William Herbert is described as ''Vicar of St Peters'')&lt;/ref&gt; Hilda was one of nine siblings.&lt;ref name= "Dictionary of New Zealand Biography"&gt;Pat Irene Winton. 'Hewlett, Hilda Beatrice - Biography', from the Dictionary of New Zealand Biography. Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand, updated 1-Sep-10&lt;/ref&gt;

As a young woman she attended the [[Royal College of Art|National Art Training School]] in [[South Kensington]]. She specialised in three skills which served her well in her later aviation engineering career: woodwork, metalwork, and needlework. Her art was good enough to be exhibited. When she was 19 she visited Egypt with her parents. At the age of 21 she spent a year training as a nurse at a hospital in [[Berlin]]. She was an [[Bike_boom#1890s|early bicycle]] and motor car enthusiast and participated in automobile rallies.

She married [[Maurice Hewlett|Maurice Henry Hewlett]] on 3 January 1888 in [[St Peter's Church, Vauxhall]], where her father was the incumbent. The couple had two children, a daughter, Pia, and a son, Francis, but separated in 1914. Maurice Hewlett was unsympathetic to his wife's involvement in aviation and claimed, "Women will never be as successful in aviation as men. They have not the right kind of nerve." &lt;ref name="Elmbridge"&gt;The Elmbridge Hundred, 2009, 2010 – Article on Hilda Hewlett by Anne Wright. {{cite web |url=http://www.elmbridgemuseum.org.uk/elmbridgehundred/biographies/biography.asp?id=387 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102050655/http://www.elmbridgemuseum.org.uk/elmbridgehundred/biographies/biography.asp?id=387 |archivedate=2 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}  accessed 9 Jan 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Achievements in aviation===
Hewlett attended her first aviation meeting at [[Blackpool]] in 1909. Later that year, after adopting the pseudonym "Grace Bird", she travelled to the airfield at [[Mourmelon-le-Grand]], France, to study aeronautics. She met aviation engineer [[Gustav Blondeau]] and they became business partners. Hewlett returned to England with a [[Farman III]] [[biplane]], nicknamed the ''Blue Bird''. In the summer of 1910 she and Blondeau opened the first flying school in the United Kingdom at the [[Brooklands]] motor-racing circuit at [[Weybridge]], Surrey. Many people gained their first experience of flying at Hewlett and Blondeau's school, including [[Thomas Sopwith]]. Thirteen pupils graduated from the school in the year and a half it operated and, with a remarkable safety record for the time, there were no accidents.

On 29 August 1911, at Brooklands, Hilda Hewlett became the first woman in the UK to earn a pilot's licence when she received [[List of pilots awarded an Aviator's Certificate by the Royal Aero Club in 1911|certificate No.122]] from the [[Royal Aero Club]] after completing the test in her biplane. Hewlett also taught her son, Francis, to fly; he earned [[List of pilots awarded an Aviator's Certificate by the Royal Aero Club in 1911|pilot's certificate no. 156]] on 14 November 1911 and went on to have a distinguished military aviation career in both the UK&lt;ref&gt;He took part in the [[Cuxhaven Raid]], during which he had to ditch his aircraft, a [[Short Admiralty Type 135|Short Type 135]], due to engine failure. He was rescued by a Dutch fishing vessel, which took him to the Dutch port of Ymunden, where he arrived on 2 January 1915; from there he was able to make his way back to England.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[New Zealand]], making him the first military pilot taught to fly by his mother. He earned a [[Distinguished Service Order]] in 1915 and rose to the rank of [[group captain]].

Hilda Hewlett participated in airshows and aviation competitions. On 11 September 1911 she flew her Farman biplane in an airshow at Chelson Meadow, [[Plymouth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Hewlett and Blondeau started an aircraft manufacturing business, [[Hewlett and Blondeau|Hewlett &amp; Blondeau Limited]], which was managed by Hewlett. They built [[Henry Farman|Farman]], [[Caudron]] and [[Hanriot]] aircraft under licence. The business began at Brooklands, moved to [[Battersea]], London, and finally settled on a {{convert|10|acre|m2|sing=on}} site at [[Leagrave]], Bedfordshire, in May 1914. By August 1914 the company had produced 10 different types of aircraft. During the [[First World War]], Hewlett's company manufactured more than 800 military aircraft, a specialised {{convert|90|hp|abbr=on}} engine which the British government considered vital to the war effort, and employed up to 700 people. After the war the business diversified into making farming equipment, but the factory had closed by the end of October 1920. The site remained unsold until 1926.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bath.ac.uk/~ensegb/hbomnia.htm Hewlett and Blondeau history] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050910022149/http://www.bath.ac.uk/~ensegb/hbomnia.htm |date=10 September 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A road in Luton, Hewlett Road, was named after her in recognition of the importance of the company towards the war effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.luton-dunstable.co.uk/Howard-s-Streets-Luton-road-named-UK-woman-gain/story-27483212-detail/story.html | title=Howard's Streets: Which Luton road is named after the first UK woman to gain a pilot's licence? | last =Chandler | first=Howard | publisher=LutonOnSunday | date=25 July 2015 | accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emigration to New Zealand===
Hewlett had previously spent nine months touring [[New Zealand]], [[Rarotonga]], and the United States, but it was not until the factory site was sold that she emigrated to [[Tauranga]], New Zealand, with her daughter Pia Richards and Pia's family. Hilda stated, "The urge to escape from the three Cs, crowds, convention, and civilization, became strong." She enjoyed the outdoor life, especially camping and fishing. Her family gave her the nickname "Old Bird".

In June 1932 Hewlett was present at the inaugural meeting of the Tauranga Aero and Gliding Club. In July she was elected as the club's first president. In January 1939, at the opening of a new aerodrome in Tauranga, Frederick Jones, New Zealand's then Minister of Defence, named a nearby road after Hilda Hewlett and her son Francis, in recognition of their services to aviation.

===Death and afterwards===
Hewlett died on 21 August 1943 in Tauranga, North Island, New Zealand. Following a service on the railway wharf, she was buried at sea.

Her grandson's wife Gail has carried out exhaustive research into the lives of both Hilda and Maurice Hewlett and recently published the results of this work;&lt;ref&gt;Hewlett, Gail (2010) 'Old Bird – The Irrepressible Mrs Hewlett' (Troubadour Publishing Ltd, Leicester, {{ISBN|978-1-84876-337-1}})&lt;/ref&gt; the book was officially launched on 26 April 2010 at St Peter's Church in Vauxhall, London.
