'''Moretta Fenton Beall "Molly" Reilly''' (February 25, 1922 – November 24, 1980) became the first female Canadian pilot to reach the rank of captain, the first female Canadian corporate pilot, and the [[Beechcraft Duke]] were used to improve the aircraft's. Over the course of her career, Reilly logged over 10,000 flight hours as a pilot-in-command — without a single accident. She is a member of the [[Canadian Aviation Hall of Fame]].

== Early life ==
Reilly was born February 25, 1922, in [[Lindsay, Ontario]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://collectionscanada.gc.ca/eppp-archive/100/200/301/ic/can_digital_collections/aviation/m056.htm|title=Moretta Fenton Beall Reilly|website=collectionscanada.gc.ca|access-date=2017-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cahf.ca/CUSTOMPAGES/907/MemberList.cfm?firstLetter=R#175|title=Moretta Fenton Beall Reilly|last=|first=|date=|website=www.cahf.ca|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/39209984|title=Encyclopedia of women in aviation and space|last=Rosanne.|first=Welch,|date=1998|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=|isbn=0874369584|location=Santa Barbara, Calif.|pages=180-181|oclc=39209984}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had seven siblings, three sisters and four brothers, at least one brother enlisted as a pilot during [[World War II|WWII]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Career ==

=== World War II ===
After graduating from high school in 1940, Reilly took flying lessons at Pat Paterson's Flyers Limited School at [[Barker Field]]. One of her teachers was fellow Canadian aviator [[Violet Milstead]]. Reilly's flight training was cut short when WWII forced civilian aviators to stay grounded, so she applied to join the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] (RCAF) in order to complete her pilot certification, but was rejected due to her gender. Although the [[Air Transport Auxiliary]] accepted women, Reilly couldn't join without her pilot's license. Determined to find a job that involved flying, in 1941 she finally enlisted with the RCAF as a photographer in the new [[Royal Canadian Air Force Women's Division|Women's Division]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; She continued working as a [[Non-commissioned officer|non-commissioned officer]] for the RCAF until 1946.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Post-war era ===
In 1946, after the war ended, Reilly was finally able to finish her flight lessons, earning her private pilot's license from what would later become the [[Rockcliffe Flying Club]] in [[Ottawa]]. By 1947, she had earned her commercial flight license. 

That same year, Reilly gained national media attention when she participated in the 1947 [[Webster Memorial Trophy|Webster Trophy]] aviation race.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; She was awarded the Sanderson Shield for placing as runner-up&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/eppp-archive/100/200/301/ic/can_digital_collections/aviation/e056.htm|title=Moretta Fenton Beall Reilly (extra information)|website=www.collectionscanada.gc.ca|access-date=2017-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;, finishing barely three-tenths of a point behind the first place winner.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

After completing her instructor's certification, Reilly was hired as a flight instructor at the [[Leavens Brothers Flying School]] in [[Toronto]]. During her employment at the school, she continued to upgrade her aviation skills, earning multi-engine and instrument ratings at the [[Spartan School of Aeronautics]] before completing her seaplane pilot qualifications at [[Port Alberni]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 1953, Reilly travelled to England to earn a senior commercial license, a public transport license, and her air transport ratings.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; A year later, she was hired as the chief flying instructor and charter pilot for [[Canadian Aircraft Renters]]. In 1957, she was promoted as full-time charter pilot for the company, transferred to its subsidiary [[Southern Provincial Airlines]], becoming the first Canadian female pilot to reach the rank of captain.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; During her work at Southern Provincial Airlines, Reilly became the first woman to fly professionally to the [[Arctic]]&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;, and assisted in the development of the company's air ambulance service in Eastern Canada.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Taking a new job with the [[Calgary]] company Peter Bawden Drilling in 1959, Reilly co-piloted a [[DC-3]] airliner.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; She flew extensively throughout the north, piloting back and forth between major oil airfields and making runs to places such as [[Frobisher Bay]] and [[Resolute Bay]]. Reilly often dealt with extreme weather conditions, poor visibility, and few navigational aids.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 1965, Reilly joined [[Canadian Coachways]] (later [[Canadian Utilities]]&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;) and was hired as their chief pilot, becoming the first female corporate pilot in Canada.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She flew a [[Beechcraft Duke]] throughout North America, and made modifications to the aircraft in order to fly more efficiently in the Arctic, receiving a personal commendation from the [[Beechcraft]] chairwoman [[Olive Beech]] in the process.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Honours ==
In 1974, Reilly was inducted into the [[Canadian Aviation Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Personal life ==
In 1959, Reilly accepted a marriage proposal from pilot Jack Reilly, whom she had met through her first post-war job at the Leavens Brothers Flying School. He was her co-pilot for the DC-3 airliner at Peter Bawden Drilling.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Death and legacy ==
Reilly died on November 24, 1980.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; By the end of her career, she had logged over 10,000 hours as a pilot-in-command — without a single accident.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
