In 1937, hours after disembarking at San Francisco after a swimming tour of Japan, she commenced a three-day streak at the Nationals which produced an unprecedented four individual swimming titles.&lt;ref&gt;Nason, p. 226&lt;/ref&gt; For this she was named [[Associated Press Female Athlete of the Year]] for 1937,&lt;ref&gt;
