'''David Ascalon''' ({{lang-he|דוד אשקלון}}; born March 8, 1945) is an Israeli contemporary [[sculpture|sculptor]] and [[stained glass]] artist, and co-founder of [[Ascalon Studios]].

==Biography==
Ascalon was born in [[Tel Aviv]], in the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]] (now [[Israel]]) on March 8, 1945. He received his early artistic training as an apprentice of his father, the [[Hungary|Hungarian]]-born sculptor and industrial designer, [[Maurice Ascalon]] (1913–2003).

Ascalon came to the [[United States of America|United States]] as a teenager when his father took the family across the Atlantic as a means to broaden their horizons. He attended [[Beverly Hills High School]] in [[Beverly Hills, California]] and graduated in 1963.
David studied art and design at the [[California State University at Northridge]] as well as architecture and interior design at [[California Polytechnic State University]] in San Luis Obispo, and [[Pratt Institute]] in New York, where he received his degree. Throughout the 1970s, Ascalon worked in the fields of [[interior design]] and architecture in New York, and for the firm of the noted Israeli architect [[Aryeh Elhanani]] in Tel Aviv. Seeking a more immediate means of artistic expression than the architectural arts would allow, he began experimenting in sculptural [[metalwork]], exploring abstract compositions with a [[welding torch]]. He currently resides in the Philadelphia suburb of [[Cherry Hill, New Jersey]], and in the [[Hamptons]] on the east end of [[Long Island]], [[New York (state)|New York]].  In recent years, Ascalon has taken an active role on issues of artist rights advocacy, and in 2010 filed a federal suit under the [[Visual Artists Rights Act]] (VARA) in a case involving the rights of artist with respect to the restoration of public sculpture.  Among David's other relatives are his son, contemporary [[industrial designer]] [[Brad Ascalon]], and older brother Adir Ascalon ('''d'''.2003). Adir was a surrealist painter and sculptor who collaborated with the noted Mexican muralist [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]]. David is also a licensed airplane [[private pilot]].

==Ascalon Studios==
In 1977, David relocated to the [[Philadelphia]] area where he joined up with his father to form Ascalon Studios. It was then that he began focusing his efforts on the creation of site-specific artwork for worship and public spaces. Much of his work draws on [[ecclesiastical]] themes, however utilizing non-traditional approaches and contemporary forms. In the years since its founding, Ascalon Studios, under David’s direction, has executed hundreds of projects throughout [[North America]], ranging from monumental sculptures and liturgical [[stained glass windows]], to [[mosaic]] murals. Many of his works adorn [[synagogue architecture]] and other venues for worship. Among his sculptural installations are a number of [[Holocaust Memorial]]s that pay tribute to the victims of the atrocities (included are many from his own family).

==Awards and recognitions==
David has been the recipient of major international design commissions and awards, including from the [[American Institute of Architects]]' Interfaith Forum on Religion, Art and Architecture. He is a member of the [[International Sculpture Center]], and he is past president of the [[American Guild of Judaic Art]] and has lectured on the subject of [[Judaic]] art.
