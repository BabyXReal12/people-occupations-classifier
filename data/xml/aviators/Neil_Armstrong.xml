'''Neil Alden Armstrong''' (August 5, 1930 – August 25, 2012) was an American [[astronaut]] and [[aerospace engineering|aeronautical engineer]] who was the [[Apollo 11#Lunar surface operations|first person to walk on the Moon]]. He was also a [[United States Naval Aviator|naval aviator]], [[test pilot]], and [[university professor]].

A graduate of [[Purdue University]], Armstrong studied aeronautical engineering with his college tuition paid for by the [[U.S. Navy]] under the [[James L. Holloway, Jr.#Holloway Plan|Holloway Plan]]. He became a [[midshipman]] in 1949, and a naval aviator the following year. He saw action in the [[Korean War]], flying the [[Grumman F9F Panther]] from the [[aircraft carrier]] {{USS|Essex|CV-9|6}}. In September 1951, he was hit by [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft fire]] while making a low bombing run, and forced to bail out.  After the war, he completed his bachelor's degree at Purdue, and became a test pilot at the [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]] (NACA) [[Armstrong Flight Research Center|High-Speed Flight Station]] at [[Edwards Air Force Base]] in [[California]]. He was the project pilot on [[Century Series]] fighters, and flew the [[North American X-15]] seven times. He was also a participant in the [[U.S. Air Force]]'s [[Man in Space Soonest]] and [[Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar|X-20 Dyna-Soar]] [[human spaceflight]] programs.

Armstrong joined the [[NASA Astronaut Corps]] in the [[NASA Astronaut Group 2|second group]], which was selected in 1962. He made his first spaceflight as commander of [[Gemini 8]] in March 1966, becoming [[NASA]]'s first civilian astronaut to fly in space. During this mission with pilot [[David Scott]], he performed the first [[Spacecraft docking and berthing mechanisms|docking]] of two [[spacecraft]]; the mission was aborted after Armstrong used some of his reentry control fuel to prevent a dangerous spin caused by a stuck thruster. During training for Armstrong's second and last spaceflight as commander of [[Apollo 11]], he had to eject from the [[Lunar Landing Research Vehicle]] moments before a fiery crash.

In July 1969, Armstrong and Apollo 11 [[Lunar Module]] pilot [[Buzz Aldrin]] performed the first manned [[Moon landing]], and spent two and a half hours outside the spacecraft while [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]] remained in lunar orbit in the [[Apollo Command/Service Module|Command/Service Module]]. When Armstrong stepped onto the lunar surface, he famously said: "That's one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind." Along with Collins and Aldrin, Armstrong was awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Richard Nixon]]. President [[Jimmy Carter]] presented Armstrong with the [[Congressional Space Medal of Honor]] in 1978, and Armstrong and his former crewmates received a [[Congressional Gold Medal]] in 2009.

After he resigned from NASA in 1971, Armstrong taught in the Department of Aerospace Engineering at the [[University of Cincinnati]] until 1979. He served on the [[Apollo 13]] accident investigation, and on the [[Rogers Commission Report|Rogers Commission]], which investigated the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|Space Shuttle ''Challenger'' disaster]]. He acted as a spokesman for several businesses, and appeared in advertising for the automotive brand [[Chrysler]] starting in January 1979.

== Early years ==
Armstrong was born on August 5, 1930, near [[Wapakoneta, Ohio]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=History of Wapakoneta (or is it Wapaghkonnetta?) |publisher=City of Wapakoneta, Ohio |url=http://www.wapakoneta.net/history |access-date=August 25, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111126114925/http://www.wapakoneta.net/history |archive-date=November 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=49–50}} to Stephen Koenig Armstrong and Viola Louise Engel. He was of German and Scottish ancestry,{{sfn|Hansen|2005|p=13, 20}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Angelique |last=Chrisafis |title=Ulster Scots' Eagle fails to take off |date=May 28, 2004 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/may/28/arts.northernireland |accessdate=March 26, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402210821/http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/may/28/arts.northernireland |archivedate=April 2, 2015  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and had a younger sister, June, and a younger brother, Dean. His father worked as an [[auditor]] for the [[Government of Ohio|Ohio state government]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Neil Armstrong grants rare interview to accountants organization |publisher=CBC News |date=May 24, 2012 |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/neil-armstrong-grants-rare-interview-to-accountants-organization-1.1289392 |accessdate=April 8, 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180107163955/http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/neil-armstrong-grants-rare-interview-to-accountants-organization-1.1289392 |archivedate=January 7, 2018  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the family moved around the state repeatedly, living in sixteen towns over the next fourteen years.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|p=29}} Armstrong's love for flying grew during this time, having started early when his father took his two-year-old son to the [[National Air Races|Cleveland Air Races]]. When he was five or six, he experienced his first airplane flight in [[Warren, Ohio]], when he and his father took a ride in a [[Ford Trimotor]], also known as the "Tin Goose".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Project Apollo: Astronaut Biographies |publisher=NASA |url=https://history.nasa.gov/ap11ann/astrobios.htm#Armstrong |access-date=May 12, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110428105817/http://history.nasa.gov/ap11ann/astrobios.htm#Armstrong |archivedate=April 28, 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Hansen|2005|p=45|ps=.  "According to a volunteer group in Warren. Ohio that had worked through the 2000s to turn the Warren Airport into a historical exhibit, the date of Neil's inaugural; flight was July 26, 1936. If that date is correct, Neil was still only five when he experienced his first airplane ride, his sixth birthday not coming for ten more days." }}

His father's last move was in 1944, back to Wapakoneta. Armstrong attended [[Blume High School]], and took flying lessons at the grassy Wapakoneta airfield.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=49–50}} He earned a student flight certificate on his sixteenth birthday, then [[First solo flight|soloed]] in August, all before he had a driver's license.{{sfn|Koestler-Grack|2010|p=14}} He was active in the [[Scouting in Ohio|Boy Scouts]] and earned the rank of [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]]. As an adult, he was recognized by the [[Boy Scouts of America]] with its [[Distinguished Eagle Scout Award]] and [[Silver Buffalo Award]].&lt;ref name="desalista"&gt;{{cite web |title=Distinguished Eagle Scouts |publisher=Boy Scouts of America |url=http://www.scouting.org/filestore/pdf/02-529.pdf |access-date=November 4, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312002744/http://www.scouting.org/filestore/pdf/02-529.pdf |archivedate=March 12, 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 18, 1969, while flying toward the [[Moon]], Armstrong greeted the Scouts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |quote="I'd like to say hello to all my fellow Scouts and Scouters at [[Farragut State Park]] in [[Idaho]] having a [[National Scout jamboree (Boy Scouts of America)|National Jamboree]] there this week; and Apollo 11 would like to send them best wishes".  [[Capsule communicator]] [[Charles Duke]] replied: "Thank you, Apollo 11. I'm sure that, if they didn't hear that, they'll get the word through the news. Certainly appreciate that."|title=Apollo 11 – Day 3, part 2: Entering Eagle – Transcript |publisher=NASA |date=April 11, 2010 |url=https://history.nasa.gov/ap11fj/09day3-entering-eagle.htm |accessdate=February 10, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110104123750/http://history.nasa.gov/ap11fj/09day3-entering-eagle.htm |archivedate=January 4, 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the few personal items that he carried with him to the Moon and back was a World Scout Badge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=World Scouting salutes Neil Armstrong |publisher=World Organization of the Scout Movement |url=http://oldsite.scout.org/en/information_events/news/world_scouting_salutes_neil_armstrong |accessdate=July 27, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904004807/http://oldsite.scout.org/en/information_events/news/world_scouting_salutes_neil_armstrong |archivedate=September 4, 2015  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1947, at age 17, Armstrong began studying [[Aerospace engineering|aeronautical engineering]] at [[Purdue University]]. He was the second person in his family to attend college. He was also accepted to the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), but an uncle who had attended MIT dissuaded him from attending, telling him that it was not necessary to go all the way to [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], for a good education. His college tuition was paid for under the [[James L. Holloway, Jr.#Holloway Plan|Holloway Plan]]. Successful applicants committed to two years of study, followed by two years of flight training and one year of service in the U.S. Navy as an aviator, then completion of the final two years of their [[bachelor's degree]].{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=55–56}} He did not take courses in naval science, nor did he join the [[Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps]] at Purdue.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|p=58}}

== Navy service ==

Armstrong's call-up from the Navy arrived on January 26, 1949, requiring him to report to [[Naval Air Station Pensacola]] in [[Florida]] for flight training with class 5-49. After passing the medical examinations, he became a [[midshipman]] on February 24, 1949.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=68–69}} Flight training was conducted in a [[North American T-6 Texan|North American SNJ trainer]], in which he soloed on September 9, 1949.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|p=71}} On March 2, 1950, he made his first [[aircraft carrier]] landing on the {{USS|Cabot|CVL-28|6}}, an achievement he considered comparable to his first solo flight.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|p=71}} He was then sent to [[Naval Air Station Corpus Christi]] in Texas for training on the [[Grumman F8F Bearcat]], culminating in a carrier landing on the {{USS|Wright|CVL-49|6}}. On August 16, 1950, Armstrong was informed by letter that he was a fully qualified [[United States Naval Aviator|naval aviator]]. His mother and sister attended his graduation ceremony on August 23, 1950.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=76–79}}

Armstrong's assignment was to Fleet Aircraft Service Squadron 7 (FASRON 7) at [[Naval Air Station North Island|NAS San Diego]] (now known as NAS North Island). On November 27, 1950, he was assigned to [[VF-51]], an all-jet squadron, becoming its youngest officer, and made his first flight in a jet, a [[Grumman F9F Panther]], on January 5, 1951. He was promoted to [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]] on June 5, 1951, and made his first jet carrier landing on {{USS|Essex|CV-9|6}} two days later. On June 28, 1951, ''Essex'' had set sail for Korea, with VF-51 aboard to act as [[ground-attack aircraft]]. VF-51 flew ahead to [[Naval Air Station Barbers Point]] in Hawaii, where it conducted fighter-bomber training before rejoining the ship at the end of July.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=79–85}}

On August 29, 1951, Armstrong saw action in the [[Korean War]] as an escort for a photo [[reconnaissance]] plane over [[Songjin]].{{sfn|Hansen|2005|p=90}} Five days later, on September 3, he flew armed reconnaissance over the primary transportation and storage facilities south of the village of Majon-ni, west of [[Wonsan]]. Making a low bombing run at {{convert|350|mph|-1|abbr=on}}, Armstrong's F9F Panther was hit by [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft fire]]. While trying to regain control, he collided with a pole at a height of {{convert|20|ft|0}}, which sliced off {{convert|3|ft|0}} of the Panther's right wing.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=92–93}}

The planes have wingtip drop tanks and bubble canopies.]]
Armstrong flew the plane back to friendly territory, but due to the loss of the [[aileron]], [[ejection seat|ejection]] was his only safe option. He intended to eject over water and await rescue by Navy helicopters, but his parachute was blown back over land. A jeep driven by a roommate from flight school picked him up; it is unknown what happened to the wreckage of his aircraft, F9F-2 BuNo ''125122''.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=95–96}}

In all, Armstrong flew 78 missions over Korea for a total of 121 hours in the air, a third of them in January 1952, with the final mission on March 5, 1952. Of 492 U.S. Navy personnel killed in the Korean War, 27 of them were from the ''Essex'' on this war cruise. Armstrong received the [[Air Medal]] for 20 combat missions, two [[5/16 inch star|gold stars]] for the next 40, the [[Korean Service Medal]] and Engagement Star,{{sfn|Hansen|2005|p=112}} the [[National Defense Service Medal]] and the [[United Nations Korea Medal]]. His regular commission was terminated on February 25, 1952, and he became an ensign in the [[United States Navy Reserve]]. On completion of his combat tour with ''Essex'', he was assigned to a transport squadron, VR-32, in May 1952. He was released from active duty on August 23, 1952, but remained in the reserves, and was promoted to [[lieutenant (junior grade)]] on May 9, 1953.&lt;ref name="USN record" /&gt; As a reservist, he continued to fly, with VF-724 at [[Naval Air Station Glenview]] in Illinois, and then, after moving to California, with VF-773 at [[Naval Air Station Los Alamitos]].{{sfn|Hansen|2005|p=118}} He remained in the reserve for eight years, before resigning his commission on October 21, 1960.&lt;ref name="USN record"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.history.navy.mil/content/dam/nhhc/research/histories/bios/Armstrong-Neil/Armstrong_redacted_Redacted.pdf |title=Ex-Lieutenant (junior grade) Neil Alden Armstrong, U.S. Naval Reserve, Transcript of Naval Service |access-date=February 28, 2018 |publisher=United States Navy |date=March 27, 1967 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170506025424/https://www.history.navy.mil/content/dam/nhhc/research/histories/bios/Armstrong-Neil/Armstrong_redacted_Redacted.pdf |archivedate=May 6, 2017  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== College years ==
After his service with the Navy, Armstrong returned to Purdue. His previously earned good but not outstanding [[Academic grading in the United States#Six-point system|grades]] now improved, lifting his final Grade Point Average (GPA) to a respectable but not outstanding 4.8 out of 6.0. He pledged the [[Phi Delta Theta]] [[Fraternities and sororities in North America|fraternity]], and lived in its fraternity house. He wrote and co-directed two musicals as part of the all-student revue. The first was a version of ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarves'', co-directed with his girlfriend Joanne Alford from the [[Alpha Chi Omega]] sorority, with songs from the [[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Walt Disney film]], including ''[[Someday My Prince Will Come]]''; the second was titled ''The Land of Egelloc'', with music from [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] but new lyrics. He was chairman of the Purdue Aero Flying Club, and flew the club's aircraft, an [[Aeronca Aircraft|Aeronca]] and a couple of [[Piper Aircraft|Pipers]], which were kept at nearby Aretz Airport in [[Lafayette, Indiana]]. Flying the Aeronca to Wapakoneta in 1954, he damaged it in a rough landing in a farmer's field, and it had to be hauled back to Lafayette on a trailer.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=61–62}} He was a [[baritone horn|baritone]] player in the [[Purdue All-American Marching Band]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Purdue mourns alumnus Neil Armstrong|url=https://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2012/Q3/purdue-mourns-alumnus-neil-armstrong.html|access-date=April 2, 2018|date=August 25, 2012|publisher=Purdue University|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171216125803/http://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2012/Q3/purdue-mourns-alumnus-neil-armstrong.html|archivedate=December 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ten years later he was made an honorary member of [[Kappa Kappa Psi]] national band honorary fraternity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.purdue.edu/uns/html3month/1997/970425.Bands.campaign.html |access-date=July 10, 2018 |date=April 25, 1997 |title=Purdue Bands launch $2 million fund-raising campaign |publisher=Purdue University }}&lt;/ref&gt; Armstrong graduated with a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in [[Aeronautical Engineering]] in January 1955.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|p=118}} In 1970 he completed his [[Master of Science]] degree in [[Aerospace Engineering]] at the [[University of Southern California]] (USC).&lt;ref name=NASA-bio&gt;{{cite web |title=Biographical Data: Neil A.

Armstrong met Janet Elizabeth Shearon, who was majoring in [[family and consumer science|home economics]], at a party hosted by Alpha Chi Omega.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|p=62}} According to the couple, there was no real courtship, and neither could remember the exact circumstances of their engagement. They were married on January 28, 1956, at the Congregational Church in [[Wilmette, Illinois]]. When he moved to [[Edwards Air Force Base]], he lived in the bachelor quarters of the base, while Janet lived in the [[Westwood, Los Angeles|Westwood]] district of [[Los Angeles]]. After one semester, they moved into a house in [[Antelope Valley]]. Janet did not finish her degree, a fact she regretted later in life. The couple had three children: Eric, Karen, and Mark.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=124–128}} In June 1961, Karen was diagnosed with a [[malignant]] [[tumor]] of the middle part of her [[Brainstem|brain stem]]; X-ray treatment slowed its growth, but her health deteriorated to the point where she could no longer walk or talk. She died of [[pneumonia]], related to her weakened health, on January 28, 1962, aged two.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=161–164}}

== Test pilot ==
Following his graduation from Purdue, Armstrong became an experimental research test pilot. He applied at the [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]] (NACA) [[Armstrong Flight Research Center|High-Speed Flight Station]] at Edwards Air Force Base.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=119–120}} NACA had no open positions, and forwarded his application to the [[Glenn Research Center|Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory]] in [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]], where Armstrong made his first test flight on March 1, 1955.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=119–120}} Armstrong's stint at Cleveland lasted only a couple of months before a position at the High-Speed Flight Station became available, and he reported for work there on July 11, 1955.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|p=130}}

On his first day, Armstrong was tasked with piloting [[chase plane]]s during releases of experimental aircraft from modified bombers. He also flew the modified bombers, and on one of these missions had his first flight incident at Edwards. On March 22, 1956, he was in a [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]],{{sfn|Hansen|2005|p=134}} which was to air-drop a [[Douglas D-558-2 Skyrocket]]. He sat in the right-hand pilot seat while the left-hand seat commander, Stan Butchart, flew the B-29.&lt;ref name="Early NASA Years"&gt;{{cite web |last=Creech |first=Gray |title=From the Mojave to the Moon: Neil Armstrong's Early NASA Years |publisher=NASA |date=July 15, 2004 |url=http://www.nasa.gov/missions/research/neil_armstrong.html |access-date=May 17, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110630200654/http://www.nasa.gov/missions/research/neil_armstrong.html |archivedate=June 30, 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As they climbed to {{convert|30000|ft|km|0}}, the [[aircraft engine position number|number-four engine]] stopped and the [[Propeller (aircraft)|propeller]] began windmilling (rotating freely) in the airstream. Hitting the switch that would stop the propeller's spinning, Butchart found it slowed but then started spinning again, this time even faster than the others; if it spun too fast, it would break apart. Their aircraft needed to hold an airspeed of {{convert|210|mph|0|abbr=on}} to launch its Skyrocket payload, and the B-29 could not land with the Skyrocket attached to its belly. Armstrong and Butchart brought the aircraft into a nose-down [[Attitude (geometry)|attitude]] to increase speed, then launched the Skyrocket. At the instant of launch, the number-four engine propeller disintegrated. Pieces of it damaged the number-three engine and hit the number-two engine. Butchart and Armstrong were forced to shut down the damaged number-three engine, along with the number-one engine, due to the [[torque]] it created. They made a slow, circling descent from {{convert|30000|ft|km|0|abbr=on}} using only the number-two engine, and landed safely.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=134–136}}

Armstrong served as project pilot on [[Century Series]] fighters, including the [[North American F-100 Super Sabre]] A and C variants, the [[McDonnell F-101 Voodoo]], the [[Lockheed F-104 Starfighter]], the [[Republic F-105 Thunderchief]] and the [[Convair F-106 Delta Dart]]. He also flew the [[Douglas DC-3]], [[Lockheed T-33 Shooting Star]], [[North American F-86 Sabre]], [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II]], [[Douglas F5D-1 Skylancer]], Boeing B-29 Superfortress, [[Boeing B-47 Stratojet]] and [[Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker]], and was one of eight elite pilots involved in the [[NASA Paresev|Parasev]] paraglider research vehicle program.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=136–138}} Over his career, he flew more than 200 different models of aircraft.&lt;ref name=NASA-bio /&gt; His first flight in a [[rocket-powered aircraft]] was on August 15, 1957, in the [[Bell X-1]]B, to an altitude of {{convert|11.4|mi|km|1}}. On landing, the poorly designed [[Landing gear|nose landing gear]] failed, as had happened on about a dozen previous flights of the Bell X-1B. He flew the [[North American X-15]] seven times,{{sfn|Hansen|2005|p=145}} including the first flight with the Q-ball system, the first flight of the number 3 X-15 airframe, and the first flight of the [[MH-96]] adaptive flight control system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mach25media.com/Resources/X15FlightLog.pdf |title=The X-15 Rocket Plane: , Flight Log |pp=22, 25 |publisher=Mach 25 Media |first=Michelle |last=Evans |date=2013 |access-date=February 28, 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180413002147/http://www.mach25media.com/Resources/X15FlightLog.pdf |archivedate=April 13, 2018  }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Hansen|2005|p=147}} He became an employee of the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA) when it was established on October 1, 1958, absorbing NACA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/Biographies/glennan.html |title=T.

Armstrong was involved in several incidents that went down in Edwards folklore or were chronicled in the memoirs of colleagues. During his sixth X-15 flight on April 20, 1962, when Armstrong was testing the MH-96 control system, he flew to a height of over {{convert|207,000|ft|km}} (the highest he flew before [[Gemini 8]]). He held up the aircraft nose for too long during its descent to demonstrate the MH-96's g-limiting performance, and the X-15 ballooned back up to around {{convert|140,000|feet|km}}. He flew past the landing field at [[Mach number|Mach]] 3 ({{convert|2000|mph|-2|abbr=on|disp=comma}}) at over {{convert|100000|ft|km}} in altitude, and ended up {{convert|40|mi|km}} south of Edwards. After sufficient descent, he turned back toward the landing area, and landed, just missing [[Yucca brevifolia|Joshua trees]] at the south end. It was the longest X-15 flight in both flight time and length of the ground track.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=178–184}}

Many of the test pilots at Edwards praised Armstrong's engineering ability. [[Milton Orville Thompson|Milt Thompson]] said he was "the most technically capable of the early X-15 pilots". [[Bill Dana (pilot)|Bill Dana]] said Armstrong "had a mind that absorbed things like a sponge". Those who flew for the Air Force tended to have a different opinion, especially people like Yeager and [[William J. Knight|Pete Knight]], who did not have engineering degrees. Knight said that pilot-engineers flew in a way that was "more mechanical than it is flying", and gave this as the reason why some pilot-engineers got into trouble: their flying skills did not come naturally.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=138–139}} Armstrong made seven [[List of X-15 flights|flights in the X-15]] between November 30, 1960, and July 26, 1962.{{sfn|Jenkins|2000|pp=118–121}} He reached a top speed of Mach 5.74 ({{convert|3989|mph|0|abbr=on|disp=comma}}) in the X-15-1, and left the Flight Research Center with a total of 2,400 flying hours.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|p=210}}

On April 24, 1962, Armstrong flew for the only time with [[Chuck Yeager]]. Their job, flying a T-33, was to evaluate Smith Ranch Dry Lake in [[Nevada]] for use as an emergency landing site for the X-15. In his autobiography, Yeager wrote that he knew the lake bed was unsuitable for landings after recent rains, but Armstrong insisted on flying out anyway. As they attempted a [[Touch-and-go landing|touch-and-go]], the wheels became stuck and they had to wait for rescue. As Armstrong told the story, Yeager never tried to talk him out of it and they made a first successful landing on the east side of the lake. Then Yeager told him to try again, this time a bit slower. On the second landing, they became stuck, provoking Yeager to fits of laughter.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=184–189}}

On May 21, 1962, Armstrong was involved in the "Nellis Affair". He was sent in an F-104 to inspect [[Delamar Dry Lake]] in southern Nevada, again for emergency landings. He misjudged his altitude, and did not realize that the landing gear had not fully extended. As he touched down, the landing gear began to retract; Armstrong applied full power to abort the landing, but the ventral fin and landing gear door struck the ground, damaging the radio and releasing [[hydraulic fluid]]. Without radio communication, Armstrong flew south to [[Nellis Air Force Base]], past the control tower, and waggled his wings, the signal for a no-radio approach. The loss of hydraulic fluid caused the [[tailhook]] to release, and upon landing, he caught the arresting wire attached to an anchor chain, and dragged the chain along the runway.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=189–192}}

It took thirty minutes to clear the runway and rig another arresting cable. Armstrong telephoned Edwards and asked for someone to collect him. Milt Thompson was sent in an F-104B, the only two-seater available, but a plane Thompson had never flown. With great difficulty, Thompson made it to Nellis, where a strong crosswind caused a hard landing and the left main tire suffered a blowout. The runway was again closed to clear it, and Bill Dana was sent to Nellis in a T-33, but he almost landed long. The Nellis base operations office then decided that to avoid any further problems, it would be best to find the three NASA pilots ground transport back to Edwards.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=189–192}}

In June 1958, Armstrong was selected for the U.S. Air Force's [[Man In Space Soonest]] program, but the [[Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (ARPA) cancelled its funding on August 1, 1958, and on November 5, 1958, it was superseded by [[Project Mercury]], a civilian project run by NASA. As a NASA civilian test pilot, Armstrong was ineligible to become one of its astronauts at this time, as selection was restricted to military test pilots.{{sfn|Burgess|2013|pp=17–18}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.airspacemag.com/space-exploration/first_up.html |title=First Up? |first=Tony |last=Reichhardt |magazine=Air &amp; Space Magazine |date=August–September 2000 |access-date=February 28, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In November 1960, he was chosen as part of the pilot consultant group for the [[Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar|X-20 Dyna-Soar]], a military space plane under development by Boeing for the U.S. Air Force, and on March 15, 1962, he was selected by the U.S. Air Force as one of seven pilot-engineers who would fly the X-20 when it got off the design board.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=171–173}}{{sfn|Burgess|2013|pp=19–21}}

In April 1962, NASA announced that applications were being sought for the second group of NASA astronauts for [[Project Gemini]], a proposed two-man spacecraft. This time, selection was open to qualified civilian test pilots.{{sfn|Burgess|2013|pp=4–6}} Armstrong visited the [[Seattle World's Fair]] in May 1962, and attended a conference there on space exploration that was co-sponsored by NASA. After he returned from [[Seattle]] on June 4, he applied to become an astronaut. His application arrived about a week past the June 1, 1962, deadline, but Dick Day, a flight simulator expert with whom Armstrong had worked closely at Edwards, saw the late arrival of the application and slipped it into the pile before anyone noticed.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=193–195}} At [[Brooks Air Force Base]] at the end of June, Armstrong underwent a medical exam that many of the applicants described as painful and at times seemingly pointless.{{sfn|Burgess|2013|pp=29–30}}

NASA's Director of Flight Crew Operations, [[Deke Slayton]], called Armstrong on September 13, 1962, and asked whether he would be interested in joining the [[NASA Astronaut Corps]] as part of what the press dubbed "the [[NASA Astronaut Group 2|New Nine]]"; without hesitation, Armstrong said yes. The selections were kept secret until three days later, although newspaper reports had been circulating since earlier that year that he would be selected as the "first civilian astronaut".{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=201–202}} Armstrong was one of two civilian pilots selected for this group;{{sfn|Burgess|2013|pp=64–66}} the other was [[Elliot See]], another former naval aviator.&lt;ref name=USastronaut&gt;{{cite web |title=Elliot M.

=== Gemini program ===
==== Gemini 5 ====
On February 8, 1965, Armstrong and See were announced as the backup crew for [[Gemini 5]], with Armstrong as its commander, supporting the prime crew of [[Gordon Cooper]] and [[Pete Conrad]].{{sfn|Reichl|2016|p=78}} The purpose of the mission was to practice [[space rendezvous]] and to develop procedures and equipment for a long-duration flight of seven days. These would be required for a mission to the Moon. With two other flights ([[Gemini 3]] and [[Gemini 4]]) in preparation, there were six crews competing for simulator time, resulting in Gemini 5 being postponed. The mission lifted off on August 21.{{sfn|Hacker|Grimwood|2010|pp=255–256}} Armstrong and See watched the launch at [[Cape Kennedy]], and then flew to the [[Manned Spacecraft Center]] in Houston.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|p=239}} The mission was generally successful, despite a problem with the [[fuel cell]]s that prevented a rendezvous.

The crew assignments for Gemini 8 were announced on September 20, 1965. Under the normal rotation system, the backup crew for one mission would become the prime crew for the third mission after, but Slayton designated [[David Scott]] as the pilot of Gemini 8.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|p=240}}{{sfn|Hacker|Grimwood|2010|pp=523–529}} Scott was the first member of the [[NASA Astronaut Group 3|third group of astronauts]], whose selection was announced on October 18, 1963, to receive a prime crew assignment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/roundups/issues/63-10-30.pdf |title=14 New Astronauts Introduced at Press Conference |newspaper=Space News |volume=3 |issue=1 |date=October 30, 1963 |access-date=February 28, 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161222121909/http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/roundups/issues/63-10-30.pdf |archivedate=December 22, 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt; See was designated to command [[Gemini 9]]. Henceforth, each Gemini mission would be commanded by a member of Armstrong's group, with a member of Scott's group as the pilot. Conrad would be Armstrong's backup this time, with [[Richard F.

They were replaced by the backup crew of [[Thomas P. Stafford|Tom Stafford]] and [[Gene Cernan]], while [[Jim Lovell]] and [[Buzz Aldrin]] moved up from the backup crew of [[Gemini 10]] to become the backup for Gemini 9,{{sfn|Hacker|Grimwood|2010|pp=323–325}} and would eventually fly [[Gemini 12]].{{sfn|Cunningham|2010|p=258}}

Gemini 8 launched on March 16, 1966. It was to be the most complex yet, with a rendezvous and docking with an unmanned [[Agena target vehicle]], and the second American [[extravehicular activity]] (EVA) by Scott. In total, the mission was planned to last 75 hours and 55 orbits. After the Agena lifted off at 10:00:00 [[Eastern Time Zone|EST]],{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=242–244}} the [[Titan II GLV|Titan II]] rocket carrying Armstrong and Scott ignited at 11:41:02 EST, putting them into an orbit from which they chased the Agena.{{sfn|Hacker|Grimwood|2010|p=526}} They achieved the first-ever docking between two spacecraft in orbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=March 16, 1966: Gemini's First Docking of Two Spacecraft in Earth Orbit |publisher=NASA |url=https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/march-16-1966-geminis-first-docking-of-two-spacecraft-in-earth-orbit |access-date=April 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contact with the crew was intermittent due to the lack of tracking stations covering their entire orbits. Out of contact with the ground, the docked spacecraft began to roll, and Armstrong attempted to correct this with the [[Orbital Maneuvering System|Orbital Attitude and Maneuvering System]] (OAMS) of the Gemini spacecraft. Following the earlier advice of Mission Control, they undocked, but found that the roll increased dramatically to the point where they were turning about once per second, indicating a problem with Gemini's attitude control. Armstrong engaged the Reentry Control System (RCS) and turned off the OAMS. Mission rules dictated that once this system was turned on, the spacecraft had to re-enter at the next possible opportunity. It was later thought that damaged wiring caused one of the thrusters to become stuck in the on position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Merritt |first=Larry |title=The abbreviated flight of Gemini 8 |publisher=Boeing |url=http://bts.boeing.com/news/frontiers/archive/2006/march/i_history.html |date=March 2006 |accessdate=May 14, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812222659/http://bts.boeing.com/news/frontiers/archive/2006/march/i_history.html |archivedate=August 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were a few people in the Astronaut Office, including [[Walter Cunningham]], who felt that Armstrong and Scott "had botched their first mission".{{sfn|Cunningham|2010|pp=111–112}} There was speculation that Armstrong could have salvaged the mission if he had turned on only one of the two RCS rings, saving the other for mission objectives. These criticisms were unfounded; no malfunction procedures had been written, and it was only possible to turn on both RCS rings, not just one or the other.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=270–271}} [[Gene Kranz]] wrote, "the crew reacted as they were trained, and they reacted wrong because we trained them wrong." The mission planners and controllers had failed to realize that when two spacecraft are docked together, they must be considered to be one spacecraft. Kranz considered this the most important lesson.{{sfn|Kranz|2000|p=174}} Armstrong himself was depressed that the mission had been cut short,{{sfn|Hansen|2005|p=274}} canceling most mission objectives and robbing Scott of his EVA. The Agena was later re-used as a docking target by Gemini 10.{{sfn|Hacker|Grimwood|2010|pp=321–322}} Armstrong and Scott received the [[NASA Exceptional Service Medal]],&lt;ref name="NASA Awards"&gt;{{cite |url=https://searchpub.nssc.nasa.gov/servlet/sm.web.Fetch/Agency_Awards_Historical_Recipient_List.pdf?rhid=1000&amp;did=2120817&amp;type=released |title=Agency Awards Historical Recipient List |publisher=NASA |access-date=February 28, 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202083252/https://searchpub.nssc.nasa.gov/servlet/sm.web.Fetch/Agency_Awards_Historical_Recipient_List.pdf?rhid=1000&amp;did=2120817&amp;type=released |archivedate=December 2, 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Air Force awarded Scott the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://valor.militarytimes.com/recipient.php?recipientid=143831 |title=Valor awards for David Randolph Scott |publisher=Military Times Hall of Valor|access-date=February 28, 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180301225001/https://valor.militarytimes.com/recipient.php?recipientid=143831 |archivedate=March 1, 2018  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scott was promoted to [[lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]], and Armstrong received a $678 raise in pay to $21,653 a year ({{Inflation|US|21,653|1966|fmt=eq}}), making him NASA's highest paid astronaut.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|p=274}}

==== Gemini 11 ====
{{Main|Gemini 11}}
The final assignment for Armstrong in the Gemini program was as the back-up Command Pilot for [[Gemini 11]], announced two days after the landing of Gemini 8. Having trained for two flights, Armstrong was quite knowledgeable about the systems and took on a teaching role for the rookie backup Pilot, [[William Anders]].{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=292–293}} The launch was on September 12, 1966,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Gemini-XI |publisher=NASA (Kennedy Space Center) |url=http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/history/gemini/gemini-xi/gemini-xi.html |access-date=July 24, 2010 |date=August 25, 2000 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/64v3PKGaL?url=http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/history/gemini/gemini-xi/gemini-xi.html |archivedate=January 24, 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt; with Conrad and Gordon on board, who successfully completed the mission objectives, while Armstrong served as a [[capsule communicator]] (CAPCOM).{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=294–296}}

Following the flight, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] asked Armstrong and his wife to take part in a 24-day goodwill tour of South America.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=296–297}} Also on the tour, which took in 11 countries and 14 major cities, were Dick Gordon, [[George Low]], their wives, and other government officials. In Paraguay, Armstrong greeted dignitaries in their local language, [[Guarani language|Guarani]]; in Brazil he talked about the exploits of the Brazilian-born [[Alberto Santos-Dumont]].{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=298–299}}

=== Apollo program ===
On January 27, 1967, the date of the [[Apollo 1 fire]], Armstrong was in Washington, D.C., with Cooper, Gordon, Lovell and [[Scott Carpenter]] for the signing of the United Nations [[Outer Space Treaty]]. The astronauts chatted with the assembled dignitaries until 18:45, when Carpenter went to the airport, and the others returned to the Georgetown Inn, where they each found messages to phone the [[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center|Manned Spacecraft Center]]. During these telephone calls, they learned of the deaths of [[Gus Grissom]], [[Ed White (astronaut)|Ed White]] and [[Roger B. Chaffee|Roger Chaffee]] in the fire. Armstrong and the group spent the rest of the night drinking scotch and discussing what had happened.{{sfn|Lovell|Kluger|2000|pp=24–25}}

On April 5, 1967, the same day the Apollo 1 investigation released its final report on the fire, Armstrong assembled with 17 other astronauts for a meeting with Slayton. The first thing Slayton said was, "The guys who are going to fly the first lunar missions are the guys in this room."{{sfn|Cernan|Davis|1999|p=165}} According to Cernan, one of the astronauts present, Armstrong showed no reaction to the statement. To Armstrong it came as no surprise—the room was full of veterans of Project Gemini, the only people who could fly the lunar missions. Slayton talked about the planned missions and named Armstrong to the backup crew for [[Apollo 9]], which at that stage was planned to be a [[medium Earth orbit]] test of the [[Lunar Module]]–[[Apollo Command/Service Module|Command/Service Module]] combination.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=312–313}}

This crew assignment was officially announced on November 20, 1967.{{sfn|Brooks et al.|2009|p=374}} For crewmates, he was assigned Lovell and Aldrin, the crew of Gemini 12. After design and manufacturing delays in the Lunar Module (LM), [[Apollo 8]] and Apollo 9 swapped prime and backup crews. Based on the normal crew rotation scheme, Armstrong would command Apollo 11.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=312–313}} There would be one change. [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Mike Collins]] on the Apollo 8 crew began experiencing trouble with his legs. Doctors diagnosed the problem as a bony growth between his fifth and sixth vertebrae, requiring surgery.{{sfn|Collins|2001|pp=288–289}} Lovell took his place on the Apollo 8 crew, and, when he recovered, Collins joined Armstrong's crew.{{sfn|Cunningham|2010|p=109}}

To give the astronauts experience with how the LM would fly on its final landing descent, NASA commissioned [[Bell Aircraft]] to build two [[Lunar Landing Research Vehicle]]s (LLRV), later augmented with three Lunar Landing Training Vehicles (LLTV). Nicknamed the "Flying Bedsteads", they simulated the Moon's one-sixth of Earth's gravity by using a [[turbofan]] engine to support five-sixths of the craft's weight. On May 6, 1968, {{convert|100|feet|m|0}} above the ground, Armstrong's controls started to degrade and the LLRV began [[aircraft principal axes|rolling]].{{sfn|Hansen|2005|p=330}} He ejected safely. Later analysis suggested that if he had ejected half a second later, his parachute would not have opened in time. His only injury was from biting his tongue. The LLRV was completely destroyed.{{sfn|Kraft|2001|p=312}} Even though he was nearly killed, Armstrong maintained that without the LLRV and LLTV, the lunar landings would not have been successful, as they gave commanders valuable experience in the behavior of lunar landing craft.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|p=334}}

In addition to the LLRV training, NASA began lunar landing simulator training after Apollo 10 was completed. Aldrin and Armstrong worked with the instructors to train for the most feasible possibilities they could encounter during a real lunar landing.{{sfn|Chaikin|1994|p=171}} The pair only made time to go on one geological expedition, to the mountains of west Texas. The press found out, and filled the area with cars and a helicopter, which made it hard for the astronauts to hear the geologist. They also received briefings from geologists while at NASA.{{sfn|Chaikin|1994|p=179}}

After Armstrong served as backup commander for Apollo 8, Slayton offered him the post of commander of Apollo 11 on December 23, 1968, as Apollo 8 orbited the Moon.{{sfn|Nelson|2009|p=17}} In a meeting that was not made public until the publication of Armstrong's biography in 2005, Slayton told him that although the planned crew was Armstrong as Commander, Lunar Module (LM) Pilot Buzz Aldrin and Command Module (CM) Pilot Michael Collins, he was offering Armstrong the chance to replace Aldrin with Jim Lovell. After thinking it over for a day, Armstrong told Slayton he would stick with Aldrin, as he had no difficulty working with him and thought Lovell deserved his own command. Replacing Aldrin with Lovell would have made Lovell the Lunar Module Pilot, unofficially the lowest ranked member, and Armstrong could not justify placing Lovell, the commander of Gemini 12, in the number 3 position of the crew.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|p=338}} The crew of Apollo 11 was officially announced on January 9, 1969, as Armstrong, Collins and Aldrin, with Lovell, Anders and [[Fred Haise]] as the backup crew.{{sfn|Collins|2001|pp=312–313}}

According to [[Christopher C. Kraft Jr.|Chris Kraft]], a March 1969 meeting between Slayton, George Low, [[Robert R. Gilruth|Bob Gilruth]] and Kraft determined that Armstrong would be the first person on the Moon, in part because NASA management saw him as a person who did not have a large ego. A press conference on April 14, 1969, gave the design of the LM cabin as the reason for Armstrong's being first; the hatch opened inwards and to the right, making it difficult for the Lunar Module Pilot, on the right-hand side, to exit first. At the time of their meeting, the four men did not know about the hatch consideration. The first knowledge of the meeting outside the small group came when Kraft wrote his book.{{sfn|Kraft|2001|pp=323–324}}{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=365–373}} Methods of circumventing this difficulty existed, but it is not known if these were considered at the time. Slayton added, "Secondly, just on a pure protocol basis, I figured the commander ought to be the first guy out&amp;nbsp;... I changed it as soon as I found they had the time line that showed that. Bob Gilruth approved my decision."{{sfn|Cortright|1975|p=160}}

===== Voyage to the Moon =====
A [[Saturn V]] rocket launched Apollo 11 from [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|Launch Complex 39]] site at the [[Kennedy Space Center]] on July 16, 1969, at 13:32:00 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] (09:32:00 EDT local time).{{sfn|Orloff|2000|p=92}} Armstrong's wife Janet and two sons watched from a yacht moored on the [[Banana River]].{{sfn|Hansen|2005|p=2}} During the launch, Armstrong's heart rate peaked at 110 beats per minute.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|p=410}} He found the first stage to be the loudest—much noisier than the Gemini 8 Titan II launch. The Apollo CM was relatively roomy compared to the Gemini spacecraft. None of the Apollo 11 crew suffered from [[Space adaptation syndrome|space sickness]], as some members of previous crews had. Armstrong was especially happy, as he had been prone to [[motion sickness]] as a child and could experience [[nausea]] after doing long periods of [[aerobatics]].{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=411–412}}

[[File:Neil Armstrong.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Armstrong smiling in his spacesuit with the helmet off. He wears a headset and his eyes look slightly watery.|Armstrong in the lunar module after the completion of the [[extravehicular activity|EVA]]]]
The objective of Apollo 11 was to land safely rather than to touch down with precision on a particular spot. Three minutes into the lunar descent burn, Armstrong noted that craters were passing about two seconds too early, which meant the LM ''Eagle'' would probably touch down several miles beyond the planned landing zone.{{sfn|Smith|2005|p=11}} As the ''Eagle''{{'}}s landing [[radar]] acquired the surface, several computer error alarms appeared. The first was a code [[Jack Garman#1202|1202]] alarm, and even with their extensive training, neither Armstrong nor Aldrin was aware of what this code meant. They promptly received word from CAPCOM [[Charles Duke]] in Houston that the alarms were not a concern; the 1202 and 1201 alarms were caused by an [[Computer multitasking|executive overflow]] in the [[Apollo Guidance Computer|Lunar Module computer]]. As described by Buzz Aldrin in the documentary ''[[In the Shadow of the Moon (film)|In the Shadow of the Moon]]'', the overflow condition was caused by his own counter-checklist choice of leaving the docking radar on during the landing process, so the computer had to process unnecessary radar data and did not have enough time to execute all tasks, dropping lower-priority ones. Aldrin stated that he did so with the objective of facilitating re-docking with the CM should an abort become necessary, not realizing that it would cause the overflow condition.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=459–465}}

When Armstrong noticed they were heading toward a landing area which he believed was unsafe, he took over manual control of the LM, and attempted to find an area which seemed safer, taking longer than expected, and longer than most simulations had taken.{{sfn|Chaikin|1994|p=199}} For this reason, there was concern from Mission Control that the LM was running low on fuel.{{sfn|Chaikin|1994|p=198}} Upon landing, Aldrin and Armstrong believed they had 40 seconds left on their fuel, including the 20 seconds' worth which had to be saved in the event of an abort.{{sfn|Chaikin|1994|p=200}} During training, Armstrong had landed the LLTV with less than 15 seconds left on several occasions, and he was also confident the LM could survive a vertical fall from {{convert|50|ft|m}} if needed. Analysis after the mission showed that at touchdown there was 45 to 50 seconds of propellant burn time left.{{sfn|Manned Spacecraft Center|1969|pp=9-23–9-24}}

The landing on the surface of the Moon occurred several seconds after 20:17:40 UTC on July 20, 1969,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Jones |first=Eric M. |title=The First Lunar Landing, time 109:45:40 |url=http://www.history.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.landing.html |work=Apollo 11 Surface Journal |publisher=NASA |access-date=March 4, 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171225232200/https://history.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.landing.html |archivedate=December 25, 2017  }} That was the time of probe contact; the exact time of landing is difficult to determine, because Armstrong said the landing was "very gentle" and "It was hard to tell when we were on."&lt;/ref&gt; at which time one of three {{convert|67|in|cm|adj=on}} probes attached to three of the Lunar Module's four legs made contact with the surface, a panel light inside the LM lit up, and Aldrin called out, "Contact light." Armstrong shut the engine off and said, "Shutdown." As the LM settled onto the surface, Aldrin said, "Okay. Engine stop", then they both called out some post-landing checklist items. After a ten-second pause, Duke acknowledged the landing with, "We copy you down, ''Eagle''." Armstrong announced the landing to Mission Control and the world with the words, "Houston, [[Tranquility Base]] here. The ''Eagle'' has landed."

The official NASA flight plan called for a crew rest period before extravehicular activity, but Armstrong requested that the EVA be moved to earlier in the evening, [[Central Time Zone (North America)|Houston time]]. Once Armstrong and Aldrin were ready to go outside, ''Eagle'' was depressurized, the hatch was opened and Armstrong made his way down the ladder.{{sfn|Cortright|1975|p=215}} At the bottom of the ladder Armstrong said, "I'm going to step off the LM now". He turned and set his left boot on the lunar surface at 02:56 [[UTC]] July 21, 1969,{{sfn|Harland|1999|p=23}} then spoke the now-famous words, "That's one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind."&lt;ref name="Snopes"&gt;{{cite web |last=Mikkelson |first=Barbara |first2=David |last2=Mikkelson |title=One Small Misstep: Neil Armstrong's First Words on the Moon |date=October 2006 |website=Snopes.com |url=http://www.snopes.com/quotes/onesmall.asp |accessdate=September 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Armstrong prepared his famous [[epigram]] on his own.&lt;ref name="Plimpton" /&gt; In a post-flight press conference, he said that he chose the words "just prior to leaving the LM."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Apollo 11 Post Flight Press Conference, 16 September 1969|url=https://history.nasa.gov/ap11ann/FirstLunarLanding/ch-7.html|publisher=NASA|accessdate=July 24, 2015|quote=Yes, I did think about it.

Recordings of Armstrong's transmission do not evidence the indefinite article "a" before "man", though NASA and Armstrong insisted for years that static had obscured it. Armstrong stated he would never make such a mistake, but after repeated listenings to recordings, he eventually conceded he must have dropped the "a".&lt;ref name="Snopes" /&gt; He later said he "would hope that history would grant me leeway for dropping the syllable and understand that it was certainly intended, even if it was not said—although it might actually have been".{{sfn|Nickell|2008|p=175}} There have since been claims and counter-claims about whether acoustic analysis of the recording reveals the presence of the missing "a";&lt;ref name="Snopes" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Goddard |first=Jacqui |title=One small word is one giant sigh of relief for Armstrong |newspaper=[[The Times]] |location=London |date=October 2, 2006 |url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/world/americas/article2000645.ece |accessdate=December 31, 2012 |url-access=subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Shann Ford]], an Australian computer programmer, conducted a digital audio analysis and claims that Armstrong did say "a man", but the "a" was inaudible due to the limitations of communications technology of the time.&lt;ref name="Snopes" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ford |first=Peter Shann |title=Electronic Evidence and Physiological Reasoning Identifying the Elusive Vowel "a" in Neil Armstrong's Statement on First Stepping onto the Lunar Surface |website=CollectSpace.com |date=September 17, 2006 |url=http://www.collectspace.com/news/news-100306a.html |accessdate=August 28, 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927015424/http://www.collectspace.com/news/news-100306a.html |archivedate=September 27, 2007  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Software Finds Missing 'a' in Armstrong's Moon Quote |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=October 1, 2006 |url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/09/30/moon.quote.ap/index.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061004151135/http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/09/30/moon.quote.ap/index.html |archivedate=October 4, 2006|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ford and [[James R.

The President spoke for about a minute, after which Armstrong responded for about thirty seconds.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=505–506}} In the Apollo 11 photographic record there are only five images of Armstrong partly shown or reflected.

After helping to set up the [[Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package|Early Apollo Scientific Experiment Package]], Armstrong went for a walk to what is now known as East Crater, {{convert|65|yd|m}} east of the LM, the greatest distance traveled from the LM on the mission. Armstrong's final task was to remind Aldrin to leave a small package of memorial items to Soviet [[List of cosmonauts|cosmonauts]] [[Yuri Gagarin]] and [[Vladimir Komarov]], and Apollo 1 astronauts Grissom, White and Chaffee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Jones |first1=Eric M. |last2=Glover |first2=Ken |title=EASEP Deployment and Closeout |url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.clsout.html |work=Apollo 11 Lunar Surface Journal |publisher=NASA |accessdate=March 28, 2014 |at=111:36:38 |date=1995 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140225025455/http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.clsout.html |archivedate=February 25, 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The time spent on EVA during Apollo 11 was two and a half hours;&lt;ref name=ApolloSum /&gt; each of the subsequent five landings was allotted a progressively longer period for EVA activities—the crew of [[Apollo 17]] spent over 22 hours exploring the lunar surface.&lt;ref name=ApolloSum&gt;{{cite web |title=Summary Data on Apollo Missions |publisher=NASA |url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4214/app5.html |accessdate=May 20, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117134054/http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4214/app5.html |archivedate=January 17, 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2010 interview, Armstrong explained that NASA limited his Moon walk because they were unsure how the spacesuits would cope with the extremely high temperature on the Moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.space.com/10469-neil-armstrong-explains-famous-apollo-11-moonwalk.html |title=Neil Armstrong Explains His Famous Apollo 11 Moonwalk |website=Space.com |accessdate=October 14, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130802234446/http://www.space.com/10469-neil-armstrong-explains-famous-apollo-11-moonwalk.html |archivedate=August 2, 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After they re-entered the LM, the hatch was closed and sealed. While preparing for the liftoff from the lunar surface, Armstrong and Aldrin discovered that, in their bulky spacesuits, they had broken the ignition switch for the ascent engine; using part of a pen, they pushed the circuit breaker in to activate the launch sequence.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=489–490}} The ''Eagle'' then continued to its rendezvous in lunar orbit, where it docked with ''Columbia'', the [[Command and Service Module]]. The three astronauts returned to Earth and splashed down in the [[Pacific Ocean]], to be picked up by the {{USS|Hornet|CV-12|6}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1969-059A |title=Apollo 11 Command and Service Module (CSM) |publisher=NASA |accessdate=August 26, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918002017/http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1969-059A |archivedate=September 18, 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After being released from an 18-day quarantine to ensure that they had not picked up any infections or diseases from the Moon, the crew were feted across the United States and around the world as part of a 45-day "Giant Leap" tour. Armstrong then took part in [[Bob Hope]]'s 1969 [[United Service Organizations|USO]] show, primarily to Vietnam.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|p=580}} In May 1970, Armstrong traveled to the Soviet Union to present a talk at the 13th annual conference of the International Committee on Space Research; after arriving in [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] from Poland, he traveled to Moscow where he met [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Premier]] [[Alexei Kosygin]]. Armstrong was the first westerner to see the supersonic [[Tupolev Tu-144]] and was given a tour of the [[Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center]], which he described as "a bit Victorian in nature".{{sfn|Hansen|2005|p=583}} At the end of the day, he was surprised to view delayed video of the launch of [[Soyuz 9]]—it had not occurred to Armstrong that the mission was taking place, even though [[Valentina Tereshkova]] had been his host and her husband, [[Andriyan Nikolayev]], was on board.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=582–584}}

=== Teaching ===

Armstrong announced shortly after the Apollo 11 flight that he did not plan to fly in space again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Christopher |last=Riley |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/jul/09/apollo-astronauts-walking-moon |title=The Moon Walkers: Twelve Men Who Have Visited Another World |date=July 10, 2009 |accessdate=May 3, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140204055219/http://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/jul/09/apollo-astronauts-walking-moon |archivedate=February 4, 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed Deputy Associate Administrator for aeronautics for the Office of Advanced Research and Technology at ARPA; he served in this position for only a year, and resigned from it and NASA in 1971.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|p=584}} He accepted a teaching position in the Department of Aerospace Engineering at the [[University of Cincinnati]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Neil Armstrong Remembered|url = http://ceas.uc.edu/about/neil-armstrong-remembered.html|website = University of Cincinnati|accessdate = November 28, 2015|language = en-US|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151208165113/http://ceas.uc.edu/about/neil-armstrong-remembered.html|archivedate = December 8, 2015|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; having chosen Cincinnati over other universities, including his ''alma mater'', Purdue, because Cincinnati had a small aerospace department.{{sfn|Hansen|2012|p=590}} He hoped that the faculty members would not be annoyed that he came straight into a professorship with only the USC master's degree.&lt;ref name="a11 crew"&gt;{{cite web |title=Apollo 11 Crew Information |work=Apollo 11 Lunar Surface Journal |last1=Jones |first1=Eric M. |publisher=NASA |date=November 1, 2005 |url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.crew.html |accessdate=August 28, 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070828070600/http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.crew.html |archivedate=August 28, 2007  }}&lt;/ref&gt; He began his master's degree while stationed at Edwards years before, and completed it after Apollo 11 by presenting a report on various aspects of Apollo, instead of a thesis on the simulation of hypersonic flight.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=590–594}}

At Cincinnati he was University Professor of Aerospace Engineering. He took a heavy teaching load and taught core classes. Armstrong created two graduate-level classes while at the university: aircraft design and experimental flight mechanics.{{sfn|Hansen|2012|p=592}} He was considered a good teacher, and was a tough grader. For research, he did not work with NASA. He did not want to give the appearance of favoritism, and he later regretted that decision. After teaching for eight years, he resigned in 1980. When the university changed from an independent municipal university to a state school, bureaucracy increased. He did not want to be a part of the faculty collective bargaining group, so he decided to teach half-time. According to Armstrong, he had the same amount of work but received half of his salary. In 1979, less than 10% of his income came from his university salary. Employees at the university did not know why he left.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=590–594}}

=== NASA commissions ===
In 1970, after the explosion and aborted lunar landing of [[Apollo 13]], Armstrong was part of [[Edgar Cortright]]'s accident investigation. He produced a detailed chronology of the flight. A 28-volt thermostat switch in an oxygen tank was supposed to be replaced with a 65-volt version, which led to the explosion. Cortright recommended a redesign of the entire tank, at a cost of $40 million. Many NASA managers, as well as Armstrong, opposed the report's recommendation to re-design the oxygen tanks, since the thermostat switch was the source of the explosion. They lost the argument, and the tanks were redesigned.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=600–603}}

In 1986, President [[Ronald Reagan]] requested that Armstrong join the [[Rogers Commission Report|Rogers Commission]], which investigated the ''Challenger'' disaster. Armstrong was appointed vice chairman of the commission. He was in charge of the operational side of the commission, and performed private interviews with contacts he developed over the years to help determine the cause of the accident. As vice chair, he helped keep the number of recommendations the committee gave to nine. He believed if there were too many recommendations, NASA would not act on them.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=610–616}}

Armstrong was appointed to a fourteen-member commission by President Reagan, to develop a plan for American civilian spaceflight in the 21st century. The commission was chaired by Dr. [[Thomas O. Paine]], former NASA administrator, who Armstrong had worked with during the Apollo program. The group published a book titled ''Pioneering the Space Frontier: The Report on the National Commission on Space''. The commission recommended establishing a permanent lunar base by 2006 and sending humans to Mars by 2015. The recommendations were largely ignored, as the fallout from the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|Space Shuttle ''Challenger'' disaster]] took priority.{{sfn|Hansen|2012|pp=609–610}}

Armstrong and his wife attended the memorial service for the victims of the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|Space Shuttle ''Columbia'' disaster]] in 2003, at the invitation of President [[George W. Bush]].{{sfn|Hansen|2012|pp=616–617}}

=== Business activities ===
After Armstrong retired from NASA in 1971, he acted as a spokesman for several businesses. The first company to successfully approach him was [[Chrysler]], for whom he appeared in advertising starting in January 1979. Armstrong thought they had a strong engineering division, and they were in financial difficulty. He later acted as a spokesman for other American companies, including General Time Corporation and the Bankers Association of America.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|p=595}} He only acted as a spokesman for American companies.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|p=596}}

Along with spokesman duties, he also served on the board of directors of several companies. The first company which Armstrong joined the board was [[Gates Learjet]], chairing their technical committee. He flew their new and experimental jets and even set a climb and altitude record for business jets. Armstrong became a member of [[Cincinnati Gas &amp; Electric Company]]'s board in 1973. They were interested in nuclear power and wanted to increase the company's technical competence. He served on the board of [[Taft Broadcasting]], also based in Cincinnati. Armstrong joined [[Thiokol]]'s board in 1989, after he was vice-chair of the Rogers Commission; the [[Space Shuttle]] ''Challenger'' was destroyed due to a problem with the Thiokol-manufactured solid rocket boosters. When Armstrong left the University of Cincinnati, he became the chairman of [[Cardwell International Ltd]]., a company that manufactured drilling rigs. He served on additional aerospace boards, first [[United Airlines]] in 1978 and later [[Eaton Corporation]] in 1980. He was asked to chair the board of directors for a subsidiary of Eaton, [[AIL Systems]]. He chaired the board through the company's 2000 merger with [[EDO Corporation]], until his retirement in 2002.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=596–598}}

=== North Pole expedition ===
In 1985, professional expedition leader Mike Dunn organized a trip to take men he deemed the "greatest explorers" to the [[North Pole]]. The group included Armstrong, [[Edmund Hillary]], [[Peter Hillary|Hillary's son Peter]], [[Steve Fossett]], and [[Patrick Morrow]], and arrived on April 6, 1985. Armstrong said he was curious to see what the North Pole looked like from ground level, as he had only seen it from the Moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/neil-armstrong-and-sir-edmund-hillarys-trip-to-the-north-pole|title=When Neil Armstrong and Edmund Hillary Took a Trip to the North Pole|date=August 27, 2013|publisher=Atlas Obscura|access-date=May 19, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160512111015/http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/neil-armstrong-and-sir-edmund-hillarys-trip-to-the-north-pole|archivedate=May 12, 2016|last1=Bruhns|first1=Sarah}}&lt;/ref&gt; Armstrong wanted to keep the expedition private, and kept the media in the dark about the trip.{{sfn|Hansen|2012|p=609}}

=== Television and film ===
In 2010, he voiced the character of Dr. Jack Morrow in ''[[Quantum Quest: A Cassini Space Odyssey]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/2010/09/quantum-quest/ |title=NASA Footage Sets Scene for Quantum Quest Movie |first=Hugh |last=Hart |publisher=WIRED |date=March 9, 2010 |access-date=February 28, 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180301224818/https://www.wired.com/2010/09/quantum-quest/ |archivedate=March 1, 2018  }}&lt;/ref&gt; an animated educational sci-fi adventure film initiated by JPL/NASA through a grant from Jet Propulsion Lab.&lt;ref name=J9P&gt;{{cite web  |title=Quantum Quest  |publisher=jupiter9productions.com  |url=http://jupiter9productions.com/news.aspx  |accessdate=October 8, 2012  |deadurl=yes  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130108191010/http://jupiter9productions.com/News.aspx  |archivedate=January 8, 2013    }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Between 1991 and 1993, he hosted ''[[First Flights with Neil Armstrong]]'', an [[aviation history]] [[documentary series]] on [[A&amp;E (TV channel)|A&amp;E]].{{sfn|Shapiro|2012|pp=9, 267, 268}}

=== Reclusiveness ===

Armstrong kept a low profile later in his life, which led to the belief that he was a recluse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2012/08/26/opinion/seymour-armstrong-appreciation/index.html|title=Neil Armstrong, a hero who shunned fame|last1=Seymour|first1=Gene|publisher=CNN|date=August 27, 2012|access-date=June 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wapo1&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/19/AR2009071901771.html?noredirect=on|title=Neil Armstrong Took One Small Step, Then Made a Giant Retreat Into Private Life|last1=Farhi|first1=Paul|newspaper=Washington Post|date=July 20, 2009|access-date=June 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He turned down most interviews and declined many public appearances. Michael Collins said in his book ''Carrying the Fire'' that when Armstrong moved to a dairy farm to become a college professor it was like he "retreated to his castle and pulled up the drawbridge". Armstrong found this amusing, and noted that, "...those of us that live out in the hinterlands think that people that live inside the Beltway are the ones that have the problems." Andrew Chaikin says in ''A Man on the Moon'' that Armstrong kept a low profile, but was not a recluse, due to participation in interviews, advertisements for Chrysler, and hosting a cable television series.{{sfn|Chaikin|2007|pp=568–570}}

Armstrong used to autograph everything except for [[first day cover]]s. Around 1993, he found out his signatures were being sold online, and most of them were forgeries, so he stopped autographing material.&lt;ref name=wapo1 /&gt; Armstrong also wrote letters congratulating Eagle Scouts on their accomplishment. He used to answer all requests for congratulations. In part of 2003, he had received 950 requests for letters to Eagle Scouts. He decided to quit the practice in the 1990s because he felt the letters should be written by people who knew the scout. These things combined contributed to the reclusiveness myth.{{sfn|Hansen|2012|pp=622–623}}

== Personal life ==
Armstrong's family described him as a "reluctant American hero".&lt;ref name="The National"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]] |title=Neil Armstrong, first man on the Moon, dead at 82 |date=August 26, 2012 |url=https://www.thenational.ae/uae/neil-armstrong-first-man-on-the-moon-dead-at-82-1.607011 |access-date=February 28, 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180304172524/https://www.thenational.ae/uae/neil-armstrong-first-man-on-the-moon-dead-at-82-1.607011 |archivedate=March 4, 2018  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/content/neil-armstrong-praised-as-a-reluctant-american-hero |date=August 30, 2012 |title=Neil Armstrong Praised as a Reluctant American Hero |first=Bob |last=Granath |publisher=NASA |access-date=July 8, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Neil Armstrong a 'reluctant American hero': family |newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]] |date=August 25, 2012 |first=Olivia |last=Hampton |access-date=July 8, 2018 | url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/neil-armstrong-a-reluctant-american-hero-family/article4499479/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Glenn]], the first American to orbit Earth, recalled Armstrong's humility. "He didn't feel that he should be out huckstering himself," Glenn told CNN. "He was a humble person, and that's the way he remained after his lunar flight, as well as before."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |title=Tributes paid to Neil Armstrong, the humblest of American heroes |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/space/9500380/Tributes-paid-to-Neil-Armstrong-the-humblest-of-American-heroes.html |date=August 26, 2013 |access-date=July 8, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some former astronauts (such as Glenn and [[Harrison Schmitt]]) sought political careers after leaving NASA, but although Armstrong was approached by political groups from both parties, he declined all offers. He described his political leanings as favoring [[states' rights]] and opposing the United States acting as the "world's policeman".{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=600–601}}

When, Armstrong applied at a local Methodist church to lead a Boy Scout troop in the late 1950s, he gave his religious affiliation as "[[deist]]".{{sfn|Hansen|2005|p=33}} His mother later said that Armstrong's religious views caused her grief and distress in later life as she was more religious.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|p=35}}  In the early 1980s, Armstrong was the subject of a hoax saying that he converted to Islam after hearing the ''[[adhan]]'', the Muslim call to prayer, while walking on the Moon. The Indonesian singer Suhaemi wrote a song called "Gema Suara Adzan di Bulan" ("The Resonant Sound of the Call to Prayer on the Moon") which described Armstrong's conversion; the song was discussed widely in various [[Jakarta]] news outlets in 1983.{{sfn|Abramson|2004|p=93}} Other similar hoax stories were seen in Egypt and Malaysia. In March 1983, the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] responded by issuing a message to embassies and consulates in Muslim countries saying that Armstrong "has not converted to Islam".{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=630–631}} The hoax surfaced occasionally for the next three decades. Part of the confusion arose from the similarity between the names of Armstrong's American residence in [[Lebanon, Ohio]], and the country of [[Lebanon]], which has a majority Muslim population.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=630–631}}

In 1972, Armstrong visited the town of [[Langholm]], Scotland, the traditional seat of [[Clan Armstrong]]; he was made the first freeman of the [[burgh]], and happily declared the town his home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Johnston |first=Willie |title=Recalling Moon man's 'muckle' leap |publisher=BBC News |date=July 20, 2009 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/8158762.stm |access-date=July 20, 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090720100435/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/8158762.stm |archivedate=July 20, 2009  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Justice of the Peace]] read from an unrepealed 400-year-old law that required him to hang any Armstrong found in the town.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|p=13}}

While working at his farm near Lebanon, Ohio, in November 1978, Armstrong jumped off the back of his grain truck and his wedding ring got caught in the wheel, tearing off the tip of his left hand's ring finger. He collected the severed digit and packed it in ice, and surgeons reattached it at the Jewish Hospital in Louisville, Kentucky.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|p=608}} In February 1991, a year after his father had died, and nine months after the death of his mother, he suffered a mild heart attack while skiing with friends at [[Aspen, Colorado]].{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=639–640}}

Armstrong's first wife, Janet, divorced him in 1994, after 38 years of marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Schorn |first=Daniel |title=Being The First Man On The Moon  |publisher=CBS News |date=July 2, 2006 |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/11/03/60minutes/main1008288_page3.shtml |accessdate=January 9, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101013013459/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/11/03/60minutes/main1008288_page3.shtml |archivedate=October 13, 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt; He had already met his second wife, Carol Held Knight, in 1992 at a golf tournament, where they were seated together at the breakfast table. She said little to Armstrong, but two weeks later she received a call from him asking what she was doing—she replied she was cutting down a cherry tree; 35 minutes later Armstrong was at her house to help out. They were married on June 12, 1994, in Ohio, and then had a second ceremony, at San Ysidro Ranch, in California. He lived in [[Indian Hill, Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Johnston |first=John |last2=Amrhein |first2=Saundra |last3=Thompson |first3=Richelle |title=Neil Armstrong, Reluctant Hero |date=July 18, 1999 |newspaper=[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]] |url=http://www.enquirer.com/editions/1999/07/18/loc_neil_armstrong_the.html |access-date=March 4, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=643–645}}

After 1993, Armstrong refused all requests for autographs because his signed items were selling for large amounts of money and many forgeries were in circulation; any requests that were sent to him received a [[form letter]] in reply, saying that he had stopped signing.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=622–623}} Although his no-autograph policy was well known, author [[Andrew Smith (author)|Andrew Smith]] observed people at the 2002 [[Reno Air Races]] trying to get signatures, with one person claiming, "If you shove something close enough in front of his face, he'll sign."{{sfn|Smith|2005|p=134}} He also stopped sending out congratulatory letters to new Eagle Scouts, because he believed these letters should come from people who knew the Scouts personally.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|p=623}}

In a eulogy, Charles Bolden praised Armstrong's "courage, grace, and humility". Cernan recalled Armstrong's low-fuel approach to the Moon: "When the gauge says empty we all know there's a gallon or two left in the tank!" [[Diana Krall]] sang the song "[[Fly Me to the Moon]]". Collins led prayers. Scott recalled their Gemini 8 mission with Armstrong when he spoke, possibly for the first time, about an incident in which glue spilled on his harness and prevented it from locking correctly minutes before the hatch had to be sealed or the mission aborted.

In September 2012, the U.S. Navy announced that the first ''Armstrong''-class vessel would be named {{warship|RV|Neil Armstrong|AGOR-27|6}}. The ship was delivered to the Navy on September 23, 2015.  It is a modern oceanographic research platform capable of supporting a wide range of oceanographic research activities conducted by academic groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Navy Announces Research Vessel to be Named in Honor of Neil Armstrong |date=September 24, 2012 |publisher=United States Navy |url=http://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=69758 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121202044715/http://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=69758 |archivedate=December 2, 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Armstrong's authorized biography, ''[[First Man: The Life of Neil A. Armstrong]]'', was published in 2005. For many years, Armstrong turned down biography offers from authors such as [[Stephen Ambrose]] and [[James A. Michener]], but agreed to work with James R. Hansen after reading one of Hansen's other biographies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=McGauley |first=John |title=Discovering the Man Behind 'First Man' |date=October 14, 2005 |website=CollectSpace.com |url=http://www.collectspace.com/news/news-013003b.html#100305 |access-date=February 28, 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180131140927/http://www.collectspace.com/news/news-013003b.html#100305 |archivedate=January 31, 2018  }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[First Man (film)|film adaptation of the book]] starring [[Ryan Gosling]] and directed by [[Damien Chazelle]] is scheduled to be released in October 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/ryan-gosling-damien-chazelle-neil-armstrong-biopic-first-man-release-date-trailer-oscars-2019-best-a7618146.html |title=First Man: Damien Chazelle and Ryan Gosling's Neil Armstrong biopic gets awards season release date |first=Jacob |last=Stolworthy |date=March 8, 2017 |access-date=February 28, 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180201013746/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/ryan-gosling-damien-chazelle-neil-armstrong-biopic-first-man-release-date-trailer-oscars-2019-best-a7618146.html |archivedate=February 1, 2018  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2010 ''Space Foundation'' survey, Armstrong was ranked as the #1 most popular space hero,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Space Foundation Survey Reveals Broad Range of Space Heroes |publisher=Space Foundation |date=October 27, 2010 |accessdate=May 13, 2011 |url=http://www.spacefoundation.org/news/story.php?id=1038 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69vzcgxKu?url=http://www.spacefoundation.org/media/press-releases/space-foundation-survey-reveals-broad-range-space-heroes-early-astronauts-still?id=1038 |archivedate=August 15, 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2013, ''[[Flying (magazine)|Flying]]'' magazine ranked him at #1 on its list of the "51 Heroes of Aviation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=51 Heroes of Aviation |newspaper=Flying |url=http://www.flyingmag.com/photo-gallery/photos/51-heroes-aviation?pnid=41853 |access-date=February 28, 2018 |date=July 24, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016015011/http://www.flyingmag.com/photo-gallery/photos/51-heroes-aviation?pnid=41853 |archivedate=October 16, 2015  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The press often asked Armstrong for his views on the future of spaceflight. In 2005, Armstrong said that a [[manned mission to Mars]] will be easier than the lunar challenge of the 1960s. In 2010, he made a rare public criticism of the decision to cancel the [[Ares I]] launch vehicle and the [[Constellation program|Constellation Moon landing program]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|quote=I suspect that even though the various questions are difficult and many, they are not as difficult and many as those we faced when we started the Apollo [space program] in 1961.|last=Kaplan |first=Jeremy A. |title=Star Wars: Neil Armstrong, Obama Spar Over NASA's Future |date=April 14, 2010 |publisher=Fox News |url=http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2010/04/14/obama-vs-neil-armstrong-nasa-constellation/?test=latestnews |access-date=February 28, 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151029081228/http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2010/04/14/obama-vs-neil-armstrong-nasa-constellation/?test=latestnews |archivedate=October 29, 2015  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an open letter also signed by fellow Apollo veterans Lovell and Cernan, he noted, "For The United States, the leading space faring nation for nearly half a century, to be without carriage to low Earth orbit and with no human exploration capability to go beyond Earth orbit for an indeterminate time into the future, destines our nation to become one of second or even third rate stature".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Armstrong |first=Neil |last2=Lovell |first2=James |last3=Cernan |first3=Eugene |title=Armstrong: Obama NASA plan 'devastating' |date=April 14, 2010 |publisher=NBC Nightly News |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/36470363 |access-date=February 28, 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103111342/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/36470363 |archivedate=November 3, 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Armstrong had also publicly recalled his initial concerns about the Apollo 11 mission, when he had believed there was only a 50 percent chance of landing on the Moon. "I was elated, ecstatic and extremely surprised that we were successful", he later said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Sean |last=Yoong |title=Neil Armstrong: Manned Mars mission 20 years away |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |location=Washington DC |date=September 6, 2005 |url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/space/2005-09-06-mars-armstrong_x.htm |accessdate=May 3, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726194523/http://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/space/2005-09-06-mars-armstrong_x.htm |archivedate=July 26, 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 18, 2010, aged 80, Armstrong said in a speech during the ''[[Meet the Future, Science &amp; Technology Summit 2010|Science &amp; Technology Summit]]'' in The Hague, Netherlands, that he would offer his services as commander on a mission to Mars if he were asked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Neil Armstrong wil nog best naar Mars |trans-title=Neil Armstrong still wants to go to Mars |newspaper=NU.nl |via=ANP |language=nl |date=November 18, 2010 |url=http://www.nu.nl/wetenschap/2382331/neil-armstrong-wil-nog-best-mars.html |access-date=February 28, 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180220151853/https://www.nu.nl/wetenschap/2382331/neil-armstrong-wil-nog-best-mars.html |archivedate=February 20, 2018  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
