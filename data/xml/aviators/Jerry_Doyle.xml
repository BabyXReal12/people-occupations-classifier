'''Jerry Doyle''' (July 16, 1956 – July 27, 2016) was an American [[talk radio]] host, [[right-libertarian]] [[political commentator]], [[television actor]] and founder of the content platform [[EpicTimes]]. His [[radio syndication|nationally syndicated]] [[talk radio|talk show]], ''The Jerry Doyle Show'', aired throughout the United States on [[Talk Radio Network]]. As an actor, Doyle is known for his role as [[Michael Garibaldi]] in the [[science fiction on television|science fiction series]] ''[[Babylon 5]]'' (1994–1998).

==Early life==
Doyle grew up in [[Brooklyn, New York]], raised as the eldest son of a police officer and a housewife. He spent the first six months of his life in an orphanage before being adopted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Babylon 5 actor Jerry Doyle dead at age 60 after he was found unresponsive in his Las Vegas home|url=http://www.wydailynews.com/trending/26845-babylon-5-actor-jerry-doyle-dead-at-age-60-after-he-was-found-unresponsive-in-his-las-vegas-home.html|accessdate=July 28, 2016|work=Wyoming Daily News|date=July 28, 2016}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from Pope John XXIII Regional High School in [[Sparta, New Jersey]], in 1973, where he played varsity football and basketball. In 1978, Doyle earned a Bachelor of Science Degree in Aeronautics from [[Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University]],&lt;ref name=deadline/&gt; while also receiving his flight training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Flayton|first1=Leigh|title=On the Air|url=http://lift.erau.edu/wp-content/uploads/lift-2009-spring.pdf|accessdate=July 28, 2016|work=Lift|date=Spring 2009|pages=8–11|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Television and radio career==
Previously a corporate [[Jet aircraft|jet]] [[aviator|pilot]] and after a decade as a [[stockbroker]] on [[Wall Street]],&lt;ref name=ign/&gt; Doyle made an abrupt career change into acting in 1991, when he moved to Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=deadline/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbcobit"&gt;{{cite news|title=Babylon 5 actor Jerry Doyle dies aged 60|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-36918773|accessdate=July 28, 2016|work=BBC News|date=July 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first television role was on the series ''[[Moonlighting (TV series)|Moonlighting]]'' where he played a potential replacement for [[Bruce Willis]]' character.&lt;ref name=deadline/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gilman|first1=Greg|title=Jerry Doyle, ‘Babylon 5’ Star and EpicTimes Founder, Dies at 60|url=http://www.thewrap.com/jerry-doyle-dead-babylon-5-actor-epictimes-founder-died-60/|publisher=TheWrap|accessdate=July 28, 2016|date=July 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by a recurring role as a lawyer on the soap opera ''[[The Bold and the Beautiful]]''. ''Babylon 5'' was his first significant starring role, starring as security officer Michael Garibaldi.&lt;ref name=deadline/&gt; Doyle quipped that on ''Babylon 5'' he was a "[[List of ethnic slurs#M|Mick]] from Brooklyn playing a [[Wop]] from Mars."&lt;ref name=deadline&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lincoln|first1=Ross A.|title=Jerry Doyle Dies: ‘Bablylon 5’ Actor &amp; Talk Radio Host Was 60|url=http://deadline.com/2016/07/babylon-5-actor-jerry-doyle-dies-at-60-1201794378/|accessdate=July 28, 2016|work=Deadline Hollywood|date=July 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1996 to 1997 Doyle was the voice of the title character in animated cartoon ''[[Captain Simian &amp; the Space Monkeys]]''.

He began his own production company to move into production television and independent films, which he described as an "experiment". Other work included a series on the aircraft of the [[Second World War]] entitled ''Keep 'em Flying'', alongside producer John Copeland, with whom Doyle had previously worked on ''Babylon 5''.&lt;ref name=ign&gt;{{cite web|last1=P|first1=Ken|title=Interview: Jerry Doyle|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2003/08/26/interview-jerry-doyle|publisher=IGN|accessdate=July 28, 2016|date=August 26, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Doyle was a frequent guest on [[Newsmax Media]] TV, primarily on the program Midpoint with Ed Berliner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jerry Doyle On Newsmax TV: Has America Lost It's Mojo?|url=http://www.epictimes.com/08/08/2014/jerry-doyle-on-newsmax-tv-has-america-lost-its-mojo/|publisher=EpicTimes|accessdate=July 28, 2016|date=August 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had also been a featured guest on ''[[Fox &amp; Friends]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jerry Doyle opines on the economy on Fox &amp; Friends|url=http://rbr.com/jerry-doyle-opines-on-the-economy-on-fox-friends/|publisher=Radio+Television|accessdate=July 28, 2016|date=December 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radio===
Weekdays from 3&amp;nbsp;p.m.–6&amp;nbsp;p.m. PT (6&amp;nbsp;–9&amp;nbsp; ET), the ''Jerry Doyle Show'' aired on the [[Talk Radio Network]], although the show aired at different times in different markets. It was the sixth most popular talk radio show in the country, with an average of 3.75 million listeners on a weekly basis by early 2012.&lt;ref name="ronpaul"/&gt;

Doyle was announced as the replacement program for ''[[The Savage Nation]]'' in Talk Radio Network's lineup in October 2012. ''The Savage Nation'', at the time the third most-listened-to radio talk show in the United States, abruptly ended its run September 26 when host [[Michael Savage]] won a lawsuit against TRN. Doyle replaced Savage on all of Savage's approximately 300 affiliates except for those who chose their own replacement programs. He launched the new media content platform [[EpicTimes]] in February 2013, which served as a "one stop shop" for both hard hitting news of the day as well as entertaining "[[water cooler#Water cooler effect|water cooler]]" type pieces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Jerry Doyle Launches EpicTimes.com|work=Radio Syndication Talk|date=February 12, 2013|accessdate=September 10, 2014|url=http://radiosyndicationtalk.com/2013/02/12/jerry-doyle-launches-epictimes-com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title='Babylon 5' Star and Syndicated Radio Personality Jerry Doyle Announces EpicTimes.com Digital Network Expansion with Kickstarter Campaign|publisher=PRWeb|date=June 12, 2014|accessdate=September 10, 2014|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2014/06/prweb11937432.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was subsequently banned within China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chinese Government Bans “The Jerry Doyle Show’s” Digital Platform, EpicTimes.com|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/news/community/prweb11443275.htm|publisher=PRWeb|accessdate=July 28, 2016|date=December 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Doyle was married to his ''[[Babylon 5]]'' co-star [[Andrea Thompson]] from 1995 to 1997.&lt;ref name="tmz"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tmz.com/2016/07/28/jerry-doyle-babylon-5-dead/|title='Babylon 5' Star Jerry Doyle – Dead at 60|date=July 28, 2016|website=TMZ|access-date=July 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were married in [[Cabo San Lucas]], in [[Baja California Sur]], in a short ceremony. Doyle remarked that "If the ceremony takes longer than it takes for a margarita to separate, it's too long".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Beck|first1=Marilyn|last2=Jenel Smith|first2=Stacy|title=Lansbury Says Her Hip is Fine, and That's All She Wrote|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-25002247.html|accessdate=July 28, 2016|work=Daily News|date=May 2, 1995|location=Los Angeles, CA|subscription=yes|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political efforts===

Following his work on ''Babylon 5'', Doyle ran as the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] candidate for a seat in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] in 2000.&lt;ref name="bbcobit" /&gt; During the primary, Doyle did not spend any money on the campaign, and received 43,000 votes, less than half as many as the victor, incumbent [[Brad Sherman]]. He lost the general election on November 7, 2000 with Sherman earning 66% of the vote to Doyle's 30%, the Libertarian candidate's 3%, and the Natural Law candidate's 1%. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Incumbents Hold Advantage in Local Congressional Races|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-83402717.html|accessdate=July 28, 2016|work=Daily News|date=October 12, 2000|location=Los Angeles, CA|subscription=yes|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2011, Doyle endorsed [[Ron Paul]] for the Presidency of the United States.&lt;ref name="ronpaul"&gt;{{cite news|title=Ron Paul Endorsed by Nationally Syndicated Radio Talk Show Host Jerry Doyle|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-276565333.html|accessdate=July 28, 2016|work=Defense &amp; Aerospace Week|date=January 4, 2012|subscription=yes|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Death ===
On July 27, 2016, eleven days after his 60th birthday, Doyle was found unresponsive in his Las Vegas home, and declared dead shortly thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bacle|first1=Ariana|title=Jerry Doyle, Babylon 5 star, dies|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/07/28/jerry-doyle-babylon-5-dead-dies|accessdate=July 28, 2016|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=July 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Condolences were received from his former co-stars, including from [[Bruce Boxleitner]], who wrote that he was "so devastated at the news of the untimely death of my good friend".&lt;ref name="bbcobit"/&gt; ''Babylon 5'' creator [[J. Michael Straczynski]] released a statement, saying "Regardless of whatever was going on in his life, whether it was marital issues, a broken arm, forced couch-surfing with Bruce and Andreas or other problems, he never once pulled a [[prima donna]] on us; he showed up every day on time, knew his lines, and insisted that the guest cast live up to the standards of the main cast."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fletcher|first1=Harry|title=Babylon 5 star Jerry Doyle dies, aged 60|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/ustv/news/a802929/babylon-5-star-jerry-doyle-dies-aged-60/|publisher=Digital Spy|accessdate=July 28, 2016|date=July 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Clark County Coroner's Office later stated that Doyle died from natural causes, with complications from chronic alcoholism being a contributing factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tmz.com/2016/08/31/jerry-doyle-cause-of-death-alcoholism/|title='Babylon 5' Star Jerry Doyle -- Chronic Alcoholism Contributed to Death|website=TMZ|access-date=2016-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
