==Early life==
Igor Sikorsky was born in [[Kiev]], [[Russian Empire]] (&lt;!-- Kiev --&gt;in present-day [[Ukraine]]), the youngest of five children. His father, Ivan Alexeevich Sikorsky, was a professor of [[psychology]] of Kiev St. Vladimir University, a psychiatrist with an international reputation, and an ardent Russian nationalist.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=TvqM0Fbjlb0C&amp;pg=PA72 "Homo Imperii A History of Physical Anthropology in Russia''], Marina Mogilner 2013, p.72"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=TvqM0Fbjlb0C&amp;pg=PA167 Homo Imperii A History of Physical Anthropology in Russia''], Marina Mogilner 2013, p.167"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=TvqM0Fbjlb0C&amp;pg=PA177 Homo Imperii A History of Physical Anthropology in Russia''], Marina Mogilner 2013, p.177"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Children of Rus': Right-Bank Ukraine and the Invention of a Russian Nation 2013, by Faith Hillis, {{ISBN|0801452198}}, p.259&lt;/ref&gt;

Igor Sikorsky was an Orthodox Christian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sikorskyarchives.com/His_Philosophy.php Sikorskyarchives.com]&lt;/ref&gt; When questioned regarding his roots, he would answer: "My family is of Russian origin. My grandfather and other ancestors from the time of Peter the Great were Russian Orthodox priests."&lt;ref name="Igor Sikorsky Was a Reflection of His Heritage and Experiences in life"&gt;[http://www.sikorskyarchives.com/pdf/news%202013/April%202013%202.pdf] "My family is of Russian origin."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sikorskyarchives.com/pdf/news%202013/April%202013%202.pdf Igor Sikorsky Was a Reflection of His Heritage and Experiences in life].

While [[homeschooling]] young Igor, she gave him a great love for art, especially in the life and work of [[Leonardo da Vinci]], and the stories of [[Jules Verne]]. In 1900, at age 11, he accompanied his father to Germany and through conversations with his father, became interested in [[natural sciences]]. After returning home, Sikorsky began to experiment with model flying machines, and by age 12, he had made a small rubber band-powered helicopter.&lt;ref&gt;Woods 1979, p. 254.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sikorsky began studying at the [[Saint Petersburg]] Maritime Cadet Corps, in 1903, at the age of 14. In 1906, he determined that his future lay in engineering, so he resigned from the academy, despite his satisfactory standing, and left the Russian Empire to study in Paris. He returned to the Russian Empire in 1907, enrolling at the Mechanical College of the [[Kiev Polytechnic Institute]]. After the academic year, Sikorsky again accompanied his father to Germany in the summer of 1908, where he learned of the accomplishments of the [[Wright brothers]]' Flyer and [[Ferdinand von Zeppelin]]'s [[dirigible]].&lt;ref name="franklin2"&gt;[https://www.fi.edu/case-files/igor-sikorsky "The Case Files: Igor Sikorsky"].

By the start of World War I in 1914, Sikorsky's airplane research and production business in Kiev was flourishing, and his factory made bombers during the war. After the [[October Revolution|Bolshevik revolution]] began in 1917, Igor Sikorsky fled his homeland, because the new government threatened to shoot him.&lt;ref name="300.years.spb.ru"&gt;[http://www.300.years.spb.ru/eng/3_spb_3.html?id=24] "Sergei Sikorsky: My father's fate (English translation version of an interview published in Russian by pravmir.ru)"&lt;/ref&gt; He moved to France where he was offered a contract for the design of a new, more powerful Muromets-type plane. But in November 1918 the war ended and the French government stopped subsidizing military orders, he arrived in the U.S. a few months later in 1919.&lt;ref name="300.years.spb.ru" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pravmir.ru/igor-ivanovich-sikorskij-otec-aviacii-i-xramostroitel/] "An interview with Sergei Sikorsky in Russian by pravmir.ru"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kutuzov, Mikhail.

==Aircraft designer==

With financial backing from his sister Olga, Sikorsky returned to Paris, the center of the aviation world at the time, in 1909. Sikorsky met with aviation pioneers, to ask them questions about aircraft and flying. In May 1909, he returned to Russia and began designing his first helicopter, which he began testing in July 1909. Despite his progress in solving technical problems of control, Sikorsky realized that the aircraft would never fly. He finally disassembled the aircraft in October 1909, after he determined that he could learn nothing more from the design.&lt;ref name="Woods 255"&gt;Woods 1979, p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I had learned enough to recognize that with the existing state of the art, engines, materials, and – most of all – the shortage of money and lack of experience... I would not be able to produce a successful helicopter at that time.&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/543984/Igor-Ivan-Sikorsky "Igor Sikorsky."] ''Encyclopædia Britannica, 2009'' via ''britannica.com''. Retrieved: October 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sikorsky's first aircraft of his own design, the S-1 used a 15&amp;nbsp;hp [[Anzani 3-cylinder fan engine]] in a [[pusher configuration]], that could not lift the aircraft. His second design called the S-2 was powered by a 25&amp;nbsp;hp Anzani engine in a [[tractor configuration]] and first flew on June 3, 1910 at a height of a few feet. On June 30 after some modifications, Sikorsky reached an altitude of "sixty or eighty feet" before the S-2 stalled and was completely destroyed when it crashed in a ravine.&lt;ref name=winged&gt;{{cite book |last=Sikorsky |first=Igor|first2=|last2=|title=The Story of the Winged-S|year=1944|publisher=Dodd, Mead &amp; Company|location=New York|isbn=9781258163556|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Sikorsky Celebrates." ''Popular Aviation'' September 1930, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Sikorsky built the two-seat [[Sikorsky S-5|S-5]], his first design not based on other European aircraft. Flying this original aircraft, Sikorsky earned his [[pilot license]]; [[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale]] (FAI) license No. 64 issued by the Imperial Aero Club of Russia in 1911.&lt;ref name="Woods 1979, p. 256"&gt;Woods 1979, p. 256.&lt;/ref&gt; During a demonstration of the S-5, the engine quit and Sikorsky was forced to make a crash landing to avoid a wall. It was discovered that a [[mosquito]] in the gasoline had been drawn into the [[carburetor]], starving the engine of fuel. The close call convinced Sikorsky of the need for an aircraft that could continue flying if it lost an engine.&lt;ref&gt;''Current Biography 1940'', pp. 734–736.&lt;/ref&gt; His next aircraft, the S-6 held three passengers and was selected as the winner of the Moscow aircraft exhibition held by the [[Imperial Russian Army|Russian Army]] in February 1912.&lt;ref name="Woods 1979, p. 256"/&gt;

In early 1912, Igor Sikorsky became Chief Engineer of the aircraft division for the [[Russo-Balt|Russian Baltic Railroad Car Works]] (''Russko-Baltiisky Vagonny Zavod'' or ''R-BVZ'')&lt;ref&gt;Murphy 2005, p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Saint Petersburg]].&lt;ref name="bomber"&gt;Lake 2002, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; His work at R-BVZ included the construction of the first four-[[inline engine (aviation)|engine]] aircraft, the S-21 ''[[Sikorsky Russky Vityaz|Russky Vityaz]]'', which he initially called ''Le Grand'' when fitted with just two engines, then as the ''Bolshoi Baltisky'' (The Great Baltic) when fitted with four engines for the first time, each wing panel's pair of powerplants in a "push-pull" tandem configuration previous to the four [[tractor configuration|tractor-engined]] ''Russki Vityaz''.&lt;ref name="HaddrickTaylor"&gt;{{cite book |last=Haddrick Taylor |first=Michael John |title=The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Helicopters |isbn=9780671071493 |p=34 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tdCa_zplDycC}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also served as the [[test pilot]] for its first flight on May 13, 1913.&lt;ref name="HaddrickTaylor"/&gt; In recognition for his accomplishment, he was awarded an honorary degree in engineering from [[Saint Petersburg Polytechnical Institute]] in 1914. Sikorsky took the experience from building the Russky Vityaz to develop the S-22 ''[[Sikorsky Ilya Muromets|Ilya Muromets]]'' airliner. Due to outbreak of [[World War I]], he redesigned it as the world's first four-engined [[bomber]], for which he was decorated with the [[Order of St. Vladimir]].

After World War I, Igor Sikorsky briefly became an engineer for the French forces in Russia, during the [[Russian Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1918/06/25/102714001.pdf "Airmen leave Russia."] ''The New York Times'', June 25, 1918.

In the U.S., Sikorsky first worked as a school teacher and a lecturer, while looking for an opportunity to work in the aviation industry. In 1932, he joined the faculty of the [[University of Rhode Island]] to form an aeronautical engineering program and remained with the university until 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uri.edu/home/about/history_timeline.html|title=URI History and Timeline|publisher=University of Rhode Island|accessdate=July 17, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6D8S8XJFr?url=http://www.uri.edu/home/about/history_timeline.html|archivedate=December 23, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also lectured at the [[University of Bridgeport]].

In 1923, Sikorsky formed the [[Sikorsky Aircraft|Sikorsky Manufacturing Company]] in [[Roosevelt, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;Spenser 1998, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; He was helped by several former Russian military officers. Among Sikorsky's chief supporters was composer [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]], who introduced himself by writing a check for US$5,000 (approximately $61,000 in 2007).&lt;ref&gt;Prokhorov, Vadim. [http://www.airspacemag.com/history-of-flight/Piano_Man.html "Oldies &amp; Oddities: Sikorsky's Piano Man" (History of Flight).] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120724143639/http://www.airspacemag.com/history-of-flight/Piano_Man.html |date=July 24, 2012 }} ''Air &amp; Space Magazine/Smithsonian'', Volume 17, Issue 4, November 1, 2002. Retrieved: July 17, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although his prototype was damaged in its first test flight, Sikorsky persuaded his reluctant backers to invest another $2,500. With the additional funds, he produced the [[Sikorsky S-29|S-29]], one of the first twin-engine aircraft in America, with a capacity for 14 passengers and a speed of 115&amp;nbsp;mph.&lt;ref&gt;''Current Biography 1940'', p. 735.&lt;/ref&gt;  The performance of the S-29, slow compared to military aircraft of 1918, proved to be a "make or break" moment for Sikorsky's funding.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

In 1928, Sikorsky became a [[naturalized citizen]] of the United States. The Sikorsky Manufacturing Company moved to [[Stratford, Connecticut]] in 1929. It became a part of the [[United Aircraft and Transport Corporation]] (now [[United Technologies Corporation]]) in July of that year.&lt;ref&gt;Spenser 1998, pp. 15–17.&lt;/ref&gt;  The company manufactured [[flying boat]]s, such as the [[Sikorsky S-42|S-42]] "Clipper", used by [[Pan American World Airways|Pan Am]] for transatlantic flights.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt;

Meanwhile, Sikorsky also continued his earlier work on vertical flight while living in [[Nichols, Connecticut]]. On February 14, 1929, he filed an application to patent a "direct lift" amphibian aircraft which used compressed air to power a direct lift "propeller" and two smaller propellers for thrust.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/patents/about?id=j4hOAAAAEBAJ&amp;dq=igor+sikorsky+nichols+ct "Patent number: 1848389"] ''google.com.'' Retrieved: November 25, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; On June 27, 1931, Sikorsky filed for a patent for another "direct lift aircraft", and was awarded patent No. 1,994,488 on March 19, 1935.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/patents/about?id=Nqd4AAAAEBAJ&amp;dq=1,994,488 "Patent number: 1994488."] ''google.com.''

Sikorsky's success with the VS-300 led to the [[Sikorsky R-4|R-4]], which became the world's first mass-produced helicopter, in 1942. Sikorsky's final VS-300 rotor configuration, comprising a single main rotor and a single antitorque [[tail rotor]], has proven to be one of the most popular helicopter configurations, being used in most helicopters produced today.&lt;ref name="Woods 1979, p. 262"/&gt;

Igor Sikorsky was also on the board of directors for the [[Tolstoy Foundation]] Center in [[Valley Cottage, New York]].{{cn|date=May 2018}}

==Family==
Sikorsky was married to Olga Fyodorovna Simkovitch in the Russian Empire. They were divorced and Olga remained in Russia with their daughter, Tania, as Sikorsky departed after the [[October Revolution]]. In 1923, Sikorsky's sisters immigrated to the US, bringing six-year-old Tania with them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fi.edu/learn/case-files/sikorsky/mission.html "Military Mission."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906102920/http://www.fi.edu/learn/case-files/sikorsky/mission.html |date=September 6, 2008 }} ''The Case Files: Igor Sikorsky'', ''Franklin Institute''.

==Death and legacy==
[[File:15-a Yaroslaviv Val, Kiev (Sikorsky House).jpg|thumb|The Sikorsky's family house in Kiev's historical center, October 2009]]

Sikorsky died at his home in [[Easton, Connecticut]], on October 26, 1972, and is buried in Saint John the Baptist Russian Orthodox Cemetery located on [[Connecticut Route 108|Nichols Avenue]] in [[Stratford, Connecticut|Stratford]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angelfire.com/endymion77/st_john.html "St. John the Baptist Russian Orthodox Cemetery"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, Sikorsky was inducted into the [[International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;Sprekelmeyer, Linda, editor. ''These We Honor: The International Aerospace Hall of Fame''.

The [[Igor I. Sikorsky Memorial Bridge|Sikorsky Memorial Bridge]], which carries the [[Merritt Parkway]] across the [[Housatonic River]] next to the Sikorsky corporate headquarters, is named for him. Sikorsky has been designated a Connecticut Aviation Pioneer by the Connecticut State Legislature. The Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation in Stratford, Connecticut, continues to the present day as one of the world's leading helicopter manufacturers, and a nearby small airport has been named [[Sikorsky Memorial Airport]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ja.org/hof/viewLaureate.asp?id=163&amp;alpha=S "Igor I.

In October 2011, one of the streets in Kiev was renamed after Sikorsky. The decision was made by the City Council at the request of the [[Embassy of the United States, Kiev|U.S. Embassy in Ukraine]], which opened its new office on that street.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/city/detail/115805/ "Kyiv changes street name at Washington's request"] ''[[Kyiv Post]]''.

In November 2012, one of the Russian [[supersonic]] heavy [[strategic bomber]] [[Tupolev Tu-160|Tu-160]], based at the [[Engels-2]] Air Force Base, was named for Igor Sikorsky, which caused controversy among air base crew members. One of the officers said that Igor Sikorsky does not deserve it because he laid the foundations of the U.S., rather than Russian aviation. However, the [[Long Range Aviation]] command officer said that Igor Sikorsky is not responsible for the activities of his military aircraft, noted that Sikorsky had also designed [[Sikorsky Ilya Muromets|the first heavy bomber]] for Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Mikhailov, Alexei and Bal′burov, Dmitry.

==Philosophical and religious views==
Sikorsky was a deeply religious [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]] Christian&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/10/nyregion/faith-of-the-orthodox-born-in-russia.html Faith Of the Orthodox Born in Russia]&lt;/ref&gt; and authored two religious and philosophical books (''The Message of the Lord's Prayer'' and ''The Invisible Encounter''). Summarizing his beliefs, in the latter he wrote:
{{quote|text=Our concerns sink into insignificance when compared with the eternal value of human personality – a potential child of God which is destined to triumph over life, pain, and death.
