'''Arnold Daniel Palmer''' (September 10, 1929&amp;nbsp;– September 25, 2016) was an American [[professional golfer]] who is generally regarded as one of the greatest and most charismatic players in the sport's history. Dating back to 1955, he won numerous events on both the [[PGA Tour]] and the circuit now known as [[PGA Tour Champions]]. Nicknamed '''The King''', he was one of golf's most popular stars and seen as a trailblazer, the first superstar of the sport's [[Broadcasting of sports events|television age]], which began in the 1950s.

Palmer's social impact on behalf of golf was perhaps unrivaled among fellow professionals; his humble background and plain-spoken popularity helped change the perception of golf from an elite, upper-class pastime ([[Country club|private clubs]]) to a more populist sport accessible to middle and working classes (public courses).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Reilly |first=Rick |authorlink=Rick Reilly |url=http://espn.go.com/espn/story/_/page/usopenreilly130617/tiger-major-problem |title=Sunday might never be the same |work=ESPN |date=June 17, 2013 |accessdate=June 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Palmer, [[Jack Nicklaus]], and [[Gary Player]] were "The Big Three" in golf during the 1960s; they are widely credited with popularizing and commercializing the sport around the world.

In a career spanning more than six decades, he won 62 PGA Tour titles from 1955 to [[1973 PGA Tour|1973]]. As of today, he is fifth on the Tour's all-time victory list, trailing only [[Sam Snead]], [[Tiger Woods]], [[Jack Nicklaus]], and [[Ben Hogan]]. He won seven [[Men's major golf championships|major titles]] in a six-plus-year domination from the [[1958 Masters Tournament|1958 Masters]] to the [[1964 Masters Tournament|1964 Masters]]. He also won the [[PGA Tour Lifetime Achievement Award]] in 1998, and in 1974 was one of the 13 original inductees into the [[World Golf Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldgolfhalloffame.org/arnold-palmer/ World Golf Hall of Fame] website&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
[[File:YN3ArnoldPalmer.jpg|180px|thumb|Palmer, age 23, while in the&lt;br&gt;[[United States Coast Guard|U.S. Coast Guard]] in 1953]]
[[File:ArnoldPalmerCoastGuard1953.jpg|180px|thumb|Palmer in 1953]]
Palmer was born to Doris (Morrison) and Milfred Jerome "Deacon" Palmer (1905–1976)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1976/02/07/archives/arnold-palmers-father-dies.html |title=Arnold Palmer's Father Dies |date=February 7, 1976 |newspaper=The New York Times |access-date=December 26, 2017 |issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Latrobe, Pennsylvania]], a working-class steel mill town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.golfchannel.com/news/mercer-baggs/arnie-palmers-father-imposing-lasting-figure/ |title=Arnie: Palmer's father an imposing, lasting figure |work=Golf Channel |first=Mercer |last=Baggs |date=September 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jcs-group.com/golf/arnold/backyard.html |title=A Country Club As His Backyard}}&lt;/ref&gt; He learned golf from his father, who had suffered from [[Poliomyelitis|polio]] at a young age and was head professional and greenskeeper at [[Latrobe Country Club]], which allowed young Arnold to accompany his father as he maintained the course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Gigantic Book of Golf Quotations |editor=Stewart, Wayne |year=2007 |publisher=[[Skyhorse Publishing]] |isbn=978-1-60239-072-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Palmer attended [[Wake Forest College]]&lt;!--Became "University" in 1967.--&gt; on a golf [[Athletic scholarship|scholarship]].&lt;ref name=golfweek/&gt; He left upon the death of close friend Bud Worsham (1929–1950) and enlisted in the [[United States Coast Guard|U.S. Coast Guard]], where he served for three years, 1951–1954. At the [[United States Coast Guard Training Center Cape May|Coast Guard Training Center]] in [[Cape May, New Jersey]], he built a nine-hole course and had some time to continue to hone his golf skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yun|first1=Hunki|title=Part I: Golf And The Military|url=http://www.usga.org/articles/2011/08/part-i-golf-and-the-military-21474842287.html|publisher=[[United States Golf Association]]|date=August 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his enlistment term ended, Palmer returned to college and competitive golf.&lt;ref name="nytime-death"/&gt;

Palmer won the 1954 U.S. Amateur in [[Detroit]] and made the decision to turn pro in November of that year.&lt;ref name=golfweek /&gt; "That victory was the turning point in my life," he said. "It gave me confidence I could compete at the highest level of the game."&lt;ref name=golfweek/&gt; When reporters there asked [[Gene Littler]] who the young golfer was that was cracking balls on the practice tee, Littler said: "That's Arnold Palmer. He's going to be a great player some day. When he hits the ball, the earth shakes."&lt;ref name=golfweek/&gt;

After winning that match, Palmer quit his job selling paint and played in the Waite Memorial tournament in [[Shawnee-on-Delaware, Pennsylvania]]. There, he met his future wife, Winifred Walzer, and they would remain married for 45 years until her death in 1999.&lt;ref name=golfweek/&gt;

On November 17, 1954, Palmer announced his intentions to turn pro.&lt;ref name=golfweek /&gt; "What other people find in poetry, I find in the flight of a good drive," Palmer said.&lt;ref name=golfweek/&gt;

==Career==
Palmer's first tour win came during his 1955 rookie season, when he won the [[Canadian Open (golf)|Canadian Open]] and earned $2,400 for his efforts.&lt;ref name="nytime-death"/&gt; He raised his game status for the next several seasons. Palmer's charisma was a major factor in establishing golf as a compelling television event in the 1950s and 1960s, which set the stage for the popularity it enjoys today.&lt;ref name="nytime-death"/&gt; His first major championship win at the [[1958 Masters Tournament]], where he earned $11,250, established his position as one of the leading stars in golf, and by 1960 he had signed up as pioneering sports agent [[Mark McCormack]]'s first client.&lt;ref name="nytime-death"/&gt;

In later interviews, McCormack listed five attributes that made Palmer especially marketable: his good looks; his relatively modest background (his father was a greenskeeper before rising to be club professional and Latrobe was a humble club); the way he played golf, taking risks and wearing his emotions on his sleeve; his involvement in a string of exciting finishes in early televised tournaments; and his affability.&lt;ref name="nytime-death"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Wicked Game: Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods and the Story of Modern Golf |first=Howard |last=Sounes |authorlink=Howard Sounes |year=2004 |publisher=[[William Morrow and Company|William Morrow]] |page=55 |isbn=978-0-06-051386-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Palmer is also credited by many for securing the status of [[The Open Championship]] (British Open) among U.S. players. Before [[Ben Hogan]] won that championship in 1953, few American professionals had traveled to play in The Open, due to its extensive travel requirements, relatively small purse, and the style of its [[Links (golf)|links]] courses (radically different from most American courses). Palmer wanted to emulate the feats of his predecessors [[Bobby Jones (golfer)|Bobby Jones]], [[Sam Snead]] and Hogan in his quest to become a leading American golfer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-me-arnold-palmer-snap-story.html |title='Arnold Palmer invented pro golf as it exists today': The sport's greatest ambassador dies at 87 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |first=Chris |last=Dufresne |date=September 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular, Palmer traveled to [[Scotland]] in 1960 to compete in the British Open for the first time. He had already won both the Masters and U.S. Open and was trying to emulate Hogan's 1953 feat of winning all three tournaments in a single year.&lt;ref name="nytime-death"/&gt; Palmer played what he himself said were the four best rounds of his career, shooting 71-69-67-69. His scores had the English excitedly claiming that Palmer may well be the greatest golfer ever to play the game.&lt;ref name=SI&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://www.si.com/vault/1962/07/23/667053/murder-on-a-moor |title=Murder On A Moor |magazine=Sports Illustrated |date=July 23, 1962 |first=Alfred |last=Wright}}&lt;/ref&gt; British fans were excited about Palmer's playing in the Open. Although he failed to win, losing out to [[Kel Nagle]] by a single shot,&lt;ref name="nytime-death"/&gt; his subsequent Open wins in the early 1960s convinced many American pros that a trip to Britain would be worth the effort, and certainly secured Palmer's popularity among British and European fans, not just American ones.&lt;ref name=SI/&gt;

Palmer was greatly disappointed by his runner-up finish in the 1960 British Open. His appearance overseas drew American attention to the Open Championship, which had previously been ignored by the American golfers.&lt;ref name=abc&gt;{{cite news |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/british-open-organizers-pay-tribute-arnold-palmer-42357596 |title=Player Remembers Palmer's 'Dashing Style' &amp; 'Knowing Smile' |work=ABC News |first=Gerald |last=Imray |date=September 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Palmer went on to win the Open Championship in 1961 and 1962, and last played in it in 1995. Martin Slumbers, chief executive of the [[Royal &amp; Ancient]], called Palmer "a true gentleman, one of the greatest ever to play the game and a truly iconic figure in sport".&lt;ref name=abc/&gt; His participation in The Open Championship in the early 1960s "was the catalyst to truly internationalize golf," said European Tour chief executive Keith Pelley.&lt;ref name=abc/&gt;

Palmer won seven [[men's major golf championships|major championships]]:
* [[Masters Tournament]]: [[1958 Masters Tournament|1958]], [[1960 Masters Tournament|1960]], [[1962 Masters Tournament|1962]], [[1964 Masters Tournament|1964]]

Palmer's most prolific years were 1960–1963, when he won 29 PGA Tour events, including five major tournaments, in four seasons. In 1960, he won the [[Hickok Belt]] as the top professional athlete of the year and ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' magazine's "[[Sports Illustrated Sportsperson of the Year|Sportsman of the Year]]" award. He built up a wide fan base, often referred to as "Arnie's Army", and in 1967 he became the first man to reach $1 million in career earnings on the PGA Tour. By the late 1960s [[Jack Nicklaus]] and Gary Player had both acquired clear ascendancy in their rivalry, but Palmer won a PGA Tour event every year from 1955 to 1971 inclusive, and in 1971 he enjoyed a revival, winning four events.

Palmer won the [[Vardon Trophy]] for lowest scoring average four times: 1961, 1962, 1964, and 1967. He played on six [[Ryder Cup]] teams: 1961, 1963, 1965, 1967, 1971, and 1973.&lt;ref name="nytime-death"/&gt; He was the last playing captain in 1963, and captained the team again in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.golfchannel.com/media/arnie-lee-trevino-remembers-his-ryder-cup-captain/ |title=Arnie: Trevino remembers his Ryder Cup captain |work=Golf Channel |accessdate=September 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Palmer was eligible for the Senior PGA Tour (now [[PGA Tour Champions]]) from its first season in 1980, and he was one of the marquee names who helped it to become successful. He won ten events on the tour, including five [[senior major golf championships|senior majors]].&lt;ref name="nytime-death"/&gt;

Palmer won the first [[Volvo World Match Play Championship|World Match Play Championship]] that was held in England. The event was originally organized by McCormack to showcase his stable of players. Their partnership was one of the most significant in the history of sports marketing. Long after he ceased to win tournaments, Palmer remained one of the highest earners in golf due to his appeal to sponsors and the public.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biography.com/people/arnold-palmer-9432357#pro-career |title=Arnold Palmer Biography |website=biography.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ArnoldPalmerMedalOfFreedom.jpg|thumb|Palmer gives [[George W. Bush|President Bush]] golf tips before being awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]], 2004]]
In 2004, he competed in the [[Masters Tournament]] for the last time, marking his 50th consecutive appearance in that event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.augusta.com/masters/story/news/latest-news/masters-legend-arnold-palmer-dies?quicktabs_homepage_tabs=0 |title=Masters legend Arnold Palmer dies |publisher=Augusta.com |first=John |last=Boyette |date=September 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At his death, he and Jack Nicklaus were the only two Masters champions to be regular members of Masters organizer [[Augusta National Golf Club]] (as opposed to the honorary membership the club grants to all Masters champions).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.espn.com/golf/story/_/id/17639539/arnold-palmer-dies-87 |title=Arnold Palmer dies at 87 of complications from heart problems |work=ESPN |date=September 25, 2016 |accessdate=September 26, 2016 |quote=Palmer won the Masters in 1958, 1960, 1962 and 1964 and is one of two champions – along with Jack Nicklaus – who are members of Augusta National.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2007 until his death, Palmer served as an honorary starter for the Masters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.augusta.com/stories/2009/04/10/mas_518006.shtml |title=Palmer still gets thrill |publisher=Augusta.com |date=April 10, 2009 |accessdate=June 1, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330160852/http://www.augusta.com/stories/2009/04/10/mas_518006.shtml |archive-date=March 30, 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He retired from tournament golf on October 13, 2006, when he withdrew from the Champions Tours' [[Administaff Small Business Classic]] after four holes due to dissatisfaction with his own play. He played the remaining holes but did not keep score.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/sports/AP-GLF-Champions-Tour-Palmer.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin |title='Arnie's Army' Gets Last Look at Legend |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 14, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Golf businesses===
Palmer has had a diverse golf-related business career, including owning the [[Bay Hill Club and Lodge]] in [[Orlando, Florida]], which is the venue for the PGA Tour's [[Arnold Palmer Invitational]] (renamed from the Bay Hill Invitational in [[2007 PGA Tour|2007]]), helping to found [[The Golf Channel]],&lt;ref name="nytime-death"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Arnold Palmer: Memories, Stories, and Memorabilia from a Life on and Off the Course |first=Arnold |last=Palmer |publisher=Stewart, Tabori and Chang |year=2004 |page=73 |isbn=978-1-58479-330-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and negotiating the deal to build the first golf course in the [[People's Republic of China]]. This led to the formation of Palmer Course Design in 1972, which was renamed Arnold Palmer Design Company when the company moved to Orlando, Florida, in 2006.&lt;ref name="nytime-death"/&gt; Palmer's design partner was Ed Seay.

Palmer designed more than 300 golf courses in 37 states, 25 countries, and five continents (all except Africa and Antarctica), including the first modern course built in China, in 1988.&lt;ref name=golfweek&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.golfweek.com/2016/09/25/arnold-palmer-passes-away-at-87/ |title=Golf's most beloved figure, Arnold Palmer, dies at 87 |magazine=Golfweek |first=Adam |last=Schupak |date=September 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytime-death"/&gt; In 1971, he purchased [[Latrobe Country Club]] (where his father used to be the club professional) and owned it until his death.&lt;ref name="nytime-death"/&gt; The licensing, endorsements, spokesman associations and commercial partnerships built by Palmer and McCormack are managed by Arnold Palmer Enterprises. Palmer was also a member of the [[American Society of Golf Course Architects]].

In 1997, Palmer and fellow golfer [[Tiger Woods]] initiated a civil case in an effort to stop the unauthorized sale of their images and alleged signatures in the memorabilia market. The lawsuit was filed against Bruce Matthews, the owner of Gotta Have It Golf, Inc. and others. Matthews and associated parties counter-claimed that Palmer and associated businesses committed several acts, including breach of contract, breach of implied duty of good faith and violations of Florida's Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Palmer v. Gotta Have It Golf Collectibles, Inc. |url=http://leagle.com/decision/20001395106FSupp2d1289_11249.xml/PALMER%20v.%20GOTTA%20HAVE%20IT%20GOLF%20COLLECTIBLES,%20INC. |work=106 F.Supp.2d 1289 (2000) United States District Court, S.D.

During his playing career, Arnold Palmer smoked cigarettes, which caused him to battle an addiction to nicotine. He noted that many of his colleagues smoked, and he even endorsed the product in television commercials. Later in life, Palmer made a complete about-face and urged the public to give up smoking.
