'''Joseph Jacob Foss''' (April 17, 1915 – January 1, 2003) was a [[United States Marine Corps]] [[Major (rank)|major]] and the leading Marine [[fighter ace]] in [[World War II]]. He received the [[Medal of Honor]] in recognition of his role in air combat during the [[Guadalcanal Campaign]]. In postwar years, he was an [[Air National Guard]] [[brigadier general]], served as the [[List of Governors of South Dakota|20th]] [[Governor of South Dakota]] (1955–1959), President of the [[National Rifle Association]], and first commissioner of the [[American Football League]]. He also was a [[television]] [[Television presenter|broadcaster]].

==Early years==
Foss was born in an unelectrified farmhouse near [[Sioux Falls, South Dakota]], the oldest son of Mary Esther (née Lacey) and Frank Ole Foss. He was of Norwegian and Scottish descent.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1417707/Joe-Foss.html "Joe Foss obituary"], ''The Telegraph'', January 3, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; At age 12, he visited an airfield in [[Renner, South Dakota|Renner]] to see [[Charles Lindbergh]] on tour with his aircraft, the [[Spirit of St. Louis]]. Four years later, he and his father paid $1.50 apiece to take their first aircraft ride in a [[Ford Trimotor]] at [[Black Hills Airport]] with a famed South Dakota aviator, [[Black Hills Airport|Clyde Ice]].&lt;ref name="SDPB"/&gt;

In March 1933, while coming back from the fields during a storm, his father was killed when he drove over a downed electrical cable and was electrocuted as he stepped out of his automobile.&lt;ref&gt;Bauer January 1990, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Young Foss, not yet 18 years old, pitched in with his mother and brother Cliff to continue running the family farm.&lt;ref name="Sims p. 32"/&gt; Farming was made difficult by dust storms, which over the next two years took its toll on crops and livestock.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

After watching a Marine Corps aerial team, led by Capt. Clayton Jerome, perform aerobatics in open-cockpit biplanes, he was determined to become a Marine aviator.&lt;ref name="Legend"/&gt; Foss worked at a service station to pay for books and college tuition, and to begin flight lessons from Roy Lanning, at the Sioux Skyway Airfield in 1938, scraping up $65 to pay for the instruction. His younger brother took over the management of the farm and allowed Foss to go back to school and graduate from Washington High School in Sioux Falls. He graduated from the [[University of South Dakota]] in 1939 with a degree in business administration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/jjfoss.htm "WWII ace Joe Foss dies at 87"], arlingtoncemetery.net; retrieved February 22, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

While at USD, Foss and other like-minded students convinced authorities to set up a [[Civil Aeronautics Board|CAA]] flying course at the university; he built up 100 flight hours by graduation.&lt;ref name="Sims p. 32"/&gt; Foss paid his way through university by "bussing" tables. He joined the Sigma chapter of the [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]] fraternity and excelled at sports in USD, fighting on the college boxing team, participating as a member of the track team and as a second-string guard on the football team.&lt;ref name="Sims p. 32"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nicindy.org/whos_greek/medal_of_honor_recipients "Medal of Honor recipients"], nicindy.org; accessed August 3, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Foss served as a Private in the [[147th Field Artillery Regiment]], Sioux Falls, South Dakota National Guard from 1939 to 1940. By 1940, armed with a pilot certificate and a college degree, Foss hitchhiked to Minneapolis to enlist in the Marine Corps Reserves, in order to join the Naval Aviation Cadet program to become a [[United States Naval Aviator|Naval Aviator]].&lt;ref name="Sims p. 32"&gt;Sims 1969, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military career==
[[File:Foss JJ USMC.jpg|left|200px|thumb|Foss during World War II.]]

===Effort to become a fighter pilot===
After being designated a Naval Aviator, Foss graduated at [[Pensacola, Florida]] and was commissioned as a [[Second Lieutenant#United States|second lieutenant]], then served as a "plowback" instructor at [[Naval Air Station Pensacola]]. At 26 years of age, he was considered too old to be a fighter pilot, and was instead sent to the Navy School of Photography. Upon completion of his initial assignment, he was transferred to [[VMSB-151|Marine Photographic Squadron 1]] (VMO-1) stationed at [[Naval Air Station North Island]] in [[San Diego]], California. Dissatisfied with his role in photographic reconnaissance, Foss made repeated requests to be transferred to a fighter qualification program. He checked out in [[Grumman F4F Wildcat]]s while still assigned to VMO-1, logging over 150 flight hours in June and July, 1942, and was eventually transferred to Marine Fighting Squadron 121 [[VMF-121]] as the executive officer.{{#tag:ref|Although only 27, his squadron mates gave him the unflattering nickname of "Old Foos."&lt;ref name="Miller p. 115"/&gt;|group=Note}} While stateside, Foss married his high school sweetheart, June Shakstad in 1942.&lt;ref name="Bauer p. 40"/&gt;

===Guadalcanal Flying Ace===
In October 1942, VMF-121 pilots and aircraft were sent to Guadalcanal as part of [[Guadalcanal Campaign|Operation Watchtower]] to relieve [[VMA-223|VMF-223]], which had been fighting for control of the air over the island since mid-August.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson 1978, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; On October 9, Foss and his group were catapult launched off the {{USS|Copahee|CVE-12|6}} escort carrier and flew {{convert|350|mi}} north to reach Guadalcanal.&lt;ref&gt;Yenne 2009, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; The air group, code named "Cactus", based at [[Honiara International Airport|Henderson Field]] became known as the [[Cactus Air Force]], and their presence played a pivotal role in the [[Battle of Guadalcanal]].&lt;ref name="Miller p. xi"&gt;Miller 1969, p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt; Foss soon gained a reputation for aggressive close-in fighter tactics and uncanny gunnery skills.&lt;ref name="Loomis p. 94"/&gt;{{#tag:ref|To preserve the scarce ammunition at Henderson, Foss removed one machine gun from each wing and relied on his "ability to shoot." At least four engagements were broken off when Foss ran out of ammunition.&lt;ref name="Bauer p. 40"&gt;Bauer March 1990, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}} Foss shot down a Japanese [[Mitsubishi Zero|Zero]] on his first combat mission on October 13, but his own F4F Wildcat was shot up as well, and with a dead engine and three more Zeros on his tail, he landed at full speed, with no flaps and minimal control on Henderson Field, barely missing a grove of palm trees.&lt;ref name="Tillman p. 30"&gt;Tillman 1995, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 November his Wildcat was again hit, and he survived a ditching in the sea off the island of [[Malaita]].&lt;ref&gt;Foss's flight on that memorable day is documented in [[Edward H. Sims]]' book ''Greatest Fighter Missions'', as the third chapter of that compilation.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:GeigerFoss.jpg|thumb|right|Foss stands with Cactus Air Force commander MajGen [[Roy Geiger]].]]
As lead pilot in his flight of eight Wildcats, the group soon became known as "Foss's Flying Circus", with two sections Foss nicknamed "Farm Boys" and "City Slickers."&lt;ref name="Loomis p. 94"&gt;Loomis 1961, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1942, Foss contracted malaria. He was sent to [[Sydney]], Australia for rehabilitation, where he met Australian ace [[Clive Caldwell|Clive "Killer" Caldwell]] and delivered some lectures on operational flying to RAF pilots, newly assigned to the theater.&lt;ref name="Bauer p. 40"/&gt; On January 1, 1943, Foss returned to Guadalcanal, to continue combat operations which lasted until February 9, 1943, although the Japanese attacks had waned from the height of the November 1942 crisis.&lt;ref name="Bauer p. 80"&gt;Bauer May 1990, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; In three months of sustained combat, Foss's Flying Circus had shot down 72 Japanese aircraft, including 26 credited to him.&lt;ref name="Shores p. 61"&gt;Shores 1975, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon matching the record of 26 kills held by America's top World War I ace, [[Eddie Rickenbacker]], Foss was accorded the honor of becoming America's first "ace-of-aces" in World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Gurney 1982, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;

Foss returned to the United States in March 1943. On May 18, 1943, Foss received the [[Medal of Honor]] from President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]].&lt;ref name="Shores p. 61"/&gt; The [[White House]] ceremony was featured in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine, with the reluctant Captain Foss appearing on the magazine's cover.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.life.com/image/51148313 "Joseph Foss – Life Magazine Cover"] ''Life magazine,'' June 7, 1943 via ''life.com.'' Retrieved: August 3, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; He then was asked to participate in a war bond tour that stretched into 1944.&lt;ref name="Bauer p. 80"/&gt;

===Return to combat===
[[File:USMC-C-Aces-29.jpg|thumb|L–R (foreground) Maj. Joe Foss, Maj. Marion Carl and advisor Charles Lindbergh in South Pacific, May 1944]]
In February 1944, Foss returned to the Pacific theater to lead [[VMFA-115|VMF-115]], flying the [[Vought F4U Corsair|F4U Corsair]]. VMF-115 was based in the combat zone around [[Emirau Airport|Emirau]], St. Mathias Group in 1944. It was during this second tour that Foss met and became friends with fellow Marine fighter ace [[Marion Carl]]. He also had an opportunity to meet and fly with his boyhood idol, [[Charles Lindbergh]], who was on assignment touring the South Pacific as an aviation consultant. After eight months of operational flying but no opportunities to increase his wartime score, Foss finished his combat service as one of America's top scoring pilots.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.joefoss.com/blog/19-freedom/117-joes-jokers "The Story of Joe's Jokers."] ''The Joe Foss Institute.'' Retrieved: August 4, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Foss again contracted malaria, and was sent home to the [[Klamath Falls, Oregon]] Rehabilitation Center. {{#tag:ref|Foss had lost considerable weight during 20 bouts of malaria until successful treatment in the United States brought him back to health. He only weighed 140 lbs when he entered rehabilitation.&lt;ref name="Bauer p. 82"/&gt;|group=Note}}In February 1945, he became operations and training officer at the [[Marine Corps Air Station Santa Barbara]], California.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tecom.usmc.mil/HD/Whos_Who/Foss_JJ.htm "Brigadier General Joseph Jacob Foss, ANG (Deceased)."] ''usmc.mil.''

Retrieved: August 4, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}

==Postwar==

===Air National Guard===
In August 1945, Foss was released to inactive duty and opened ''Joe Foss Flying Service'', charter flying service and flight instruction school in Sioux Falls, that eventually grew into a 35-aircraft operation. With a friend, Duane "Duke" Corning, he later owned a Packard car dealership in the town.&lt;ref&gt;Brokaw 1998, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1945, Foss was ordered to appear at Navy Day ceremonies in four cities there and was finally relieved from active duty in December 1945 but was retained in the Marine Corps Reserve on inactive duty until 1947. In 1946, Foss was appointed a [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]] in the South Dakota Air National Guard and instructed to form the [[South Dakota Air National Guard]], becoming the commanding officer for the Guard's [[175th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron]]. During the unit's formative years, Foss was actively involved in administration and flying with the squadron, even becoming a member of their [[North American P-51 Mustang|F-51 Mustang]] air demonstration team.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mva.sd.gov/museum_114th.html "114th Fighter Wing, South Dakota Air National Guard."] ''South Dakota Department of the Military and Department of Veterans Affairs.'' Retrieved: August 4, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Korean War]], Foss, then a [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]], was called to active duty with the [[United States Air Force]], relinquishing command of the 175th Squadron, and served as a Director of Operations and Training for the Central Air Defense Command; he eventually reached the rank of [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]].&lt;ref name="Century"&gt;[http://www.century-of-flight.net/Aviation%20history/WW2/aces/Joseph%20Foss.htm "Joe Foss"] ''Century of Flight,'' 2003.

===Political career===
[[File:Joe Foss official portrait as Governor.jpg|thumb|150px|Foss as Governor, 1955]]
Campaigning from the cockpit of a light aircraft, Foss served two elected terms as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] representative in the [[South Dakota State Legislature|South Dakota legislature]] and, beginning in 1955, at age 39, as the state's youngest [[Governor of South Dakota|governor]].&lt;ref name="Miller p. 212"&gt;Miller 1969, p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt; During his tenure as governor, he accompanied [[Tom Brokaw]], then a [[High school (North America)|high school]] student and Governor of South Dakota [[American Legion]] [[Boys/Girls State|Boys State]], to [[New York City]] for a joint appearance on "Two for the Money", a [[television game show]], which featured Foss because of his wartime celebrity. {{#tag:ref|Both Brokaw and Foss each won $612.&lt;ref name="Arlington"/&gt;|group=Note}}

In 1958, Foss unsuccessfully sought a seat in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]], having been defeated by another wartime pilot hero, the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[George McGovern]]. Foss tried to re-enter politics in 1962 in a campaign to succeed [[Francis H. Case|Sen. Francis Case]], who died in office. Foss and several other contenders lost to [[Joseph H. Bottum]], who filled out Case's term.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

===American Football League===
After serving as governor, Foss spent a short time working for [[Raven Industries]] before becoming the first Commissioner of the newly created [[American Football League]] in 1959. He oversaw the emergence of the league as the genesis of modern professional football. During the next seven years, Foss helped expand the league and made lucrative television deals, including the initial five-year, $10.6 million contract with [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in 1960 to broadcast AFL games. The next contract was also for five years, but with [[NFL on NBC|NBC]] for a substantially greater $36 million, starting in [[1965 American Football League season|1965]].&lt;ref name="uptvrts"&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=BusxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=EuMDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5992%2C4622151 "AFL, NBC ink pact"], ''Eugene Register-Guard'', January 29, 1964, p. 3B.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aflex66"&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=jZcrAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=vPQFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5397%2C2441193 "American Football League may be expanded in 1966."] ''Nashua Telegraph'', May 23, 1964, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television career===
Drawing on a lifelong love of hunting and the outdoors, Foss hosted [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[television]]'s ''[[The American Sportsman]]'' from 1964–67, which took him around the world for hunting and fishing excursions. He then hosted and produced his own [[television syndication|syndicated]] outdoors TV series, ''The Outdoorsman: Joe Foss'', from 1967–74. In 1972, he also began a six-year stint as Director of Public Affairs for [[KLM|KLM Royal Dutch Airlines]].&lt;ref name="Bernstein"/&gt;

===National Rifle Association===
Starting in 1988, Foss was elected to two consecutive one-year terms as president of the [[National Rifle Association]]. In his later years he maintained a rigorous speaking schedule and spoke out for conservative causes on what he considered a weakening of gun owners' rights. He was portrayed on the cover of the 29 January 1990 issue of ''[[Time Magazine]]'' wearing his trademark [[Stetson]] hat and holding a revolver.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19900129,00.html "TIME Magazine Cover: Joe Foss – Guns, Violence."] ''TIME,'' January 29, 1990.

===Philanthropy===
Foss, who had a daughter with cerebral palsy, served as President of the [[Easter Seals (U.S.)|National Society of Crippled Children and Adults]].&lt;ref name="Bernstein"/&gt; Foss's other charities included the Easter Seals campaign, [[Campus Crusade for Christ]], and an Arizona program for disadvantaged youths.

===Other honors and recognition===
Foss co-authored or was the subject of three books including the wartime ''Joe Foss: Flying Marine'' (with Walter Simmons); ''Top Guns'' (with Matthew Brennan); and ''A Proud American'' by his wife, Donna Wild Foss. Foss also provided the foreword to ''Above and Beyond: the Aviation Medals of Honor'' by [[Barrett Tillman]], and was profiled in Tom Brokaw's 1998 book about World War II and its warriors, ''[[Greatest Generation|The Greatest Generation]]''. Brokaw characterized Foss: "He had a hero's swagger but a winning smile to go with his plain talk and movie-star looks. Joe Foss was larger than life, and his heroics in the skies over the Pacific were just the beginning of a journey that would take him to places far from that farm with no electricity and not much hope north of Sioux Falls."&lt;ref&gt;Brokaw 1998, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;''Brave Eagle'', a 1955 postwar effort to film a story of Foss's life, starring his friend, [[John Wayne]], fell through in 1956 when Foss refused to allow the producers to add a fictitious love story.&lt;ref name="Bauer p. 82"&gt;Bauer May 1990, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; ''American Ace: The Joe Foss Story'' was an award-winning, hour-length television documentary, produced by the [[South Dakota Public Broadcasting]], first aired in fall 2006.&lt;ref name="SDPB"&gt;[http://www.sdpb.org/JoeFoss/default.asp "American Ace: The Joe Foss Story."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928112828/http://www.sdpb.org/JoeFoss/default.asp |date=2011-09-28 }} ''South Dakota Public Broadcasting'', 2011.

==Later years==
{{more citations needed|section|date=October 2016}}
On January 11, 2002, Foss, then 86, was in the news when he was detained by security at the [[Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport]]. He was scheduled to deliver an address at the National Rifle Association and speak to a class at the [[United States Military Academy]] at West Point. A search necessitated by his pacemaker precluding a metal detector screening had led to the discovery of the star-shaped Medal of Honor, along with a clearly marked dummy-bullet keychain, a second replica bullet and a small nail file (with MOH insignia).

The incident caused a furor with both media and public support given to Foss. Newsman Jack Cafferty noted that [[airport security]] personnel demonstrated poor judgment in not recognizing the Medal of Honor and in demanding to confiscate and destroy the medal and related memorabilia. He eventually lost a souvenir replica bullet, but was able to retain his Medal of Honor and commemorative nail file, by shipping it back to himself.&lt;ref name="Cafferty"&gt;Cafferty, Jack. [http://archives.cnn.com/2002/US/02/27/war.hero.cnna "Interview with Joe Foss: Decorated WWII veteran detained, searched at airport"], CNN.com, February 27, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"I wasn't upset for me ... I was upset for the Medal of Honor, that they just didn't know what it even was. It represents all of the guys who lost their lives – the guys who never came back. Everyone who put their lives on the line for their country. You're supposed to know what the Medal of Honor is", he said.&lt;ref&gt;Smith 2003, p. xviii.&lt;/ref&gt; The incident led to a national debate about post 9/11 airport security practices and their ramifications on the average citizen.&lt;ref&gt;Alonso-Zildivar, Ricardo. [http://articles.latimes.com/2002/mar/11/news/mn-32223 "Public Anger Simmers Over Airport Searches"], ''Los Angeles Times'', March 11, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Death==
Foss suffered a [[stroke]] in October 2002 when he bled from a cerebral [[aneurysm]]. He died three months later on [[New Year's Day]], 2003, never having regained consciousness, in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]], where he and his wife had made their home in later years.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, Richard. [http://www.andthereiwas.com/joefoss/ny_times_obit.html "Joe Foss, 87, Flying Ace Who Led Football League, Is Dead"], ''The New York Times'', January 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harriman, Peter and David Kranz. "S.D. loses legend, American hero", ''Argus Leader'', January 2, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Vice President [[Dick Cheney]], retired Colonel [[Oliver North]] and South Dakota native and NBC News anchor [[Tom Brokaw]] were among those who attended with North delivering the eulogy.

Actor [[Charlton Heston]] gave a brief tribute to his old friend. Foss was buried at [[Arlington National Cemetery]] in Section 7A, Lot 162 on January 21, 2003. Family, friends, military personnel and dignitaries remembered him fondly at a service in Arlington and at an earlier "Memorial Service for an American Patriot" in the old chapel at nearby Fort Myer.&lt;ref name="Arlington"&gt;[http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/jjfoss.htm "Joseph J.

==Aerial victories==
[[File:Foss (Guadalcanal).jpg|thumb|Profile drawing of a Grumman F4F Wildcat flown by Joe Foss (Guadalcanal, c. 1942)]]
The Marine Corps credits Foss with 26 air victories, and Marine ace [[Robert M. Hanson]] with 25 victories. However, the Marine Corps credits Marine ace [[Gregory Boyington|Gregory "Pappy" Boyington]] with 28 American victories. This is due to Boyington's (22 Marine victories) wartime claim of 6 victories scored while serving with the [[Flying Tigers]] ([[American Volunteer Group|American Volunteer Group-AVG]]) in [[China]] at the beginning of World War II, prior to him rejoining the Marine Corps;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hqinet001.hqmc.usmc.mil/HD/Historical/Whos_Who/Boyington_G.htm |title="Colonel Gregory "Pappy" Boyington, USMCR (Deceased)" |accessdate=2006-02-17 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070806113319/http://hqinet001.hqmc.usmc.mil/HD/Historical/Whos_Who/Boyington_G.htm |archivedate=August 6, 2007 |df= }} ''Who's Who in Marine Corps History''; retrieved August 3, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

AVG records show that Boyington was paid for 3.5 enemy aircraft destroyed (2-air, 1.5-ground).&lt;ref&gt;Ford, Daniel quoting Dr. Frank Olynyk.

&lt;center&gt;
'''CAPTAIN JOSEPH J. FOSS'''&lt;br/&gt;
UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS RESERVE&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
for service as set forth in the following CITATION:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
For outstanding heroism and courage above and beyond the call of duty as Executive Officer of a Marine Fighting Squadron, at Guadalcanal, Solomon Islands. Engaging in almost daily combat with the enemy from October 9 to November 19, 1942, Captain Foss personally shot down 23 Japanese aircraft and damaged others so severely that their destruction was extremely probable. In addition, during this period, he successfully led a large number of escort missions, skillfully covering reconnaissance, bombing and photographic planes as well as surface craft. On January 15, 1943, he added three more enemy aircraft to his already brilliant successes for a record of aerial combat achievement unsurpassed in this war. Boldly searching out an approaching enemy force on January 25, Captain Foss led his eight F4F Marine planes and four Army P-38s into action and, undaunted by tremendously superior numbers, intercepted and struck with such force that four Japanese fighters were shot down and the bombers were turned back without releasing a single bomb. His remarkable flying skill, inspiring leadership and indomitable fighting spirit were distinctive factors in the defense of strategic American positions on Guadalcanal.&lt;/blockquote&gt;/S/ [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]}}
