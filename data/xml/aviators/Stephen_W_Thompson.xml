'''Stephen W. Thompson''' (March 20, 1894 – October 9, 1977) was an American [[aviator]] of [[World War I]]. Flying as a gunner on a French aircraft in February 1918,  he became the first member of the [[United States Armed Forces|United States military]] to shoot down an enemy aircraft. [[Kiffin Rockwell]] achieved an earlier aerial victory as an American volunteer member of the French [[Lafayette Escadrille]] in 1916.

==Early life==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}
Thompson was born in [[West Plains, Missouri]]. When the United States entered World War I in April 1917, he was a senior in [[electrical engineering]] at the [[University of Missouri]]. The school announced that seniors who joined the military before graduation would receive their diplomas in June. So he enlisted in the Army and, after basic training at [[Fort Riley, Kansas]], in June he was sent to [[Fort Monroe, Virginia]] for training in the [[Coastal Artillery|Coast Artillery Corps.]] On the train coming into [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]] he saw an airplane in the sky — the first he had ever seen.

When he got the opportunity, he went to the flying field, the Curtis School at [[Newport News, Virginia|Newport News]], and asked if he could take a ride. [[Thomas Scott Baldwin]], who had been a famous performer in his own balloons and dirigibles, was in charge and said yes. The plane was a [[Curtiss JN-4|Curtiss JN-4 Jenny]] and the pilot was [[Edward Stinson]], a prominent flyer at the time who later founded the [[Stinson Aircraft Company]]. Stinson did a number of aerobatic maneuvers, including looping the loop five times in a row. Thompson said that the only thing that kept him from falling out of the plane at the top of the last loop was the lap belt. By the time he landed, he had decided to apply for duty in the [[United States Army Air Service|Air Service]].

==World War I==
He arrived in France in September and was assigned to the [[1st Reconnaissance Squadron|United States 1st Aero Squadron]] for training as an observer. The commander was Major [[Ralph Royce]], who became a general in the [[United States Army Air Forces|Army Air Forces]] during World War II. The training took place from a field in [[Amanty]]. The French day bombardment squadron Br.123, which flew the [[Breguet 14|Breguet 14 B2]], was nearby at [[Neufchâteau, Vosges|Neufchâteau]] aerodrome, and Royce was occasionally able to send one of his men along with the French on a raid.

==First aerial victory==
On February 5, 1918, the 1st Aero Squadron had not yet begun combat operations, and Thompson visited a French unit with a fellow member of the [[1st Aero Squadron]]. Both were invited to fly as gunner-bombardiers with the French on a bombing raid over [[Saarbrücken]], Germany. After they had dropped their bombs, the squadron was attacked by [[Albatros D.III]] fighters. Thompson shot down one of them. This was the first aerial victory by any member of the U.S. military.&lt;ref name="frey"&gt;{{cite journal | quotes = | last = Frey| first = Royal D.| year = 1968| title = Air Service Relived| journal = Air University Review| volume = 22| issue =Nov–Dec| pages =  | url = http://www.airpower.au.af.mil/airchronicles/aureview/1968/nov-dec/frey.html#frey| accessdate =23 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded the [[Croix de guerre]] with Palm for the action.

In May, he was assigned to the new [[12th Reconnaissance Squadron|12th Aero Squadron]] at [[Ourches-sur-Meuse]] airdrome, commanded by Capt. [[Lewis H. Brereton]]. On July 28, now flying from a farm field near [[La Ferté-sous-Jouarre]], he was in another memorable battle. While doing artillery spotting during a battle near [[Château-Thierry]], his [[Salmson 2|Salmson 2 A2]] was attacked by four [[Fokker D.VII]]s from what had been [[Manfred von Richthofen|Richthofen]]'s [[Jagdgeschwader 1 (World War 1)|Flying Circus]] but was by then under the command of [[Hermann Göring]]. Thompson shot down the first two planes that attacked him, but a bullet from the third hit his machine gun and disabled it. He was then hit in the leg, and his pilot was hit in the stomach by an exploding bullet. The pilot managed to crash land the plane before he died of his wounds. Thompson dug the bullet out of his leg with a pocket knife. The pilot who shot them down was the famous German [[flying ace|ace]] [[Erich Löwenhardt]], who at the time was second only to Richthofen in victories.

The uniform that Thompson was wearing when he shot down the [[Albatros D.III]] and the bullet he dug from his leg are on display at the [[National Museum of the United States Air Force]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=7155|title = Stephen Wilkins Thompson|accessdate = 2007-08-05|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071222110406/http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=7155|archivedate = 2007-12-22|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war life==
After the war Thompson worked for several years as an engineer at [[McCook Field]], the predecessor of today's [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]]. He then became a high school mathematics teacher. During World War II he taught preflight and [[meteorology]]. He maintained an interest in aviation and in 1940 he received [[U.S. Patent]] No. 2,210,642 for a tailless [[flying wing]]. He died in [[Dayton, Ohio]] at age 83.
