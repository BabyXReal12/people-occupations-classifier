'''Erich Alfred Hartmann''' (19 April 1922&amp;nbsp;– 20 September 1993), nicknamed "'''Bubi'''" ("The Kid") by his German comrades and the "'''Black Devil'''" by his Soviet adversaries, was a German fighter pilot during [[World War II]] and the most successful [[flying ace|fighter ace]] in the history of [[aerial warfare]]. He flew 1,404 combat missions and participated in aerial combat on 825 separate occasions.  He was credited with shooting down 352 Allied aircraft—345 [[Red Air Force|Soviet]] and 7 [[United States Army Air Force|American]]—while serving with the ''[[Luftwaffe]]''. During the course of his career, Hartmann was forced to crash-land his fighter 14 times due to damage received from parts of enemy aircraft he had just shot down or mechanical failure. He was never shot down or forced to land due to enemy fire.{{sfn|Toliver|Constable|1986|p=12}}

Hartmann, a pre-war [[gliding|glider pilot]], joined the ''Luftwaffe'' in 1940 and completed his fighter pilot training in 1942. He was posted to [[Jagdgeschwader 52|''Jagdgeschwader'' 52]] (JG&amp;nbsp;52) on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] and was fortunate to be placed under the supervision of some of the ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s most experienced fighter pilots. Under their guidance, Hartmann steadily developed his tactics, which earned him the coveted [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds]] on 25 August 1944 for claiming 301 aerial victories. At the time of its presentation to Hartmann, this was Germany's highest military decoration.{{refn |In 1944, the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds was second only to the [[Grand Cross of the Iron Cross]] ({{Lang |de|Großkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes}}), which was awarded only to senior commanders for winning a major battle or campaign, in the military order of the Third Reich. The [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds]] as the highest military order was surpassed on 29 December 1944 by the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Golden Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds ({{Lang|de|Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Goldenem Eichenlaub, Schwertern und Brillanten}}).|group="Note"}}

Hartmann scored his 352nd and last aerial victory at midday on 8 May 1945, hours before the war ended. Along with the remainder of JG&amp;nbsp;52, he surrendered to [[United States Army]] forces and was turned over to the [[Red Army]]. In an attempt to pressure him into service with the Soviet-friendly [[German Democratic Republic|East German]] [[National People's Army|''Volksarmee'']], he was tried on fabricated charges of war crimes and convicted; his conviction was posthumously voided by a Russian court as a [[malicious prosecution]]. He was sentenced to 25 years of hard labour and spent 10 years in various Soviet prison camps and [[gulag]]s until he was released in 1955.

In 1956, Hartmann joined the newly established [[West Germany|West German]] [[German Air Force]] in the ''[[Bundeswehr]]'', and became the first ''[[Geschwaderkommodore]]'' of [[Taktisches Luftwaffengeschwader 71 "Richthofen"|''Jagdgeschwader'' 71]] "Richthofen". He resigned early from the ''Bundeswehr'' in 1970, largely due to his opposition to the [[Lockheed F-104 Starfighter|F-104 Starfighter]] deployment in the ''Luftwaffe'' and the resulting clashes with his superiors over this issue. In his later years, after his military career had ended, he became a civilian flight instructor.{{sfn|Berger|1999|p=107}} He died on 20 September 1993 aged 71.

==Early life and career==
Erich Hartmann was born on 19 April 1922 in [[Weissach]], [[Württemberg]], to [[Physician|Doctor]] Alfred Erich Hartmann and his wife, Elisabeth Wilhelmine Machtholf. The [[Great depression|economic depression]] that followed [[World War I]] in Germany prompted Doctor Hartmann to find work in [[Changsha]], China, and Erich spent his early childhood there. The family was forced to return to [[Germany]] in 1928, when the [[Chinese Civil War]] broke out. During World War II, Hartmann's younger brother, Alfred, also joined the ''Luftwaffe'', serving as a gunner on a [[Junkers Ju 87]] in [[North Africa]]. He was captured by the [[United Kingdom|British]] and spent four years as a [[prisoner of war]].{{sfn|Toliver|Constable|1986|pp=15–16}}

Hartmann was educated at the ''[[Volksschule]]'' in [[Weil im Schönbuch]] (April 1928–April 1932), the [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] in [[Böblingen]] (April 1932–April 1936), the [[National Political Institutes of Education]] in [[Rottweil]] (April 1936–April 1937), and the Gymnasium in [[Korntal]] (April 1937–April 1940), from which he received his [[Abitur]]. It was at Korntal that he met his wife-to-be, Ursula "Usch" Paetsch.{{sfn|Toliver|Constable|1986|p=296}}

Hartmann's flying career began when he joined the [[Military glider|glider]] training program of the fledgling ''Luftwaffe'' and was taught to fly by his mother, one of the first female glider pilots in Germany. The Hartmanns also owned a [[light aircraft]] but were forced to sell it in 1932 as the German economy collapsed. The rise to power of the [[Nazi Party]] in 1933 resulted in government support for gliding, and, in 1936, Elisabeth Hartmann established the glider club in [[Weil im Schönbuch]] for locals and served as instructress.{{sfn|Toliver|Constable|1986|p=19}} The 14-year-old Hartmann became an instructor. In 1939, he gained his pilot's license, allowing him to fly powered aircraft.{{sfn|Kaplan|2007|p=89}}

Hartmann began his military training on 1 October 1940 at the 10th Flying Regiment in [[Pionersky, Kaliningrad Oblast|Neukuhren]]. On 1 March 1941, he progressed to the [[RAF Gatow|''Luftkriegsschule'' 2]] (Air War School 2) in [[Gatow|Berlin-Gatow]], making his first flight with an instructor four days later, followed in just under three weeks by his first [[First solo flight|solo flight]]. He completed his basic flying training in October 1941 and began advanced flight training at pre-fighter school 2 in [[Neustadt an der Weinstraße|Lachen-Speyerdorf]] on 1 November 1941. There, Hartmann learned combat techniques and gunnery skills. His advanced pilot training was completed on 31 January 1942, and, between 1 March 1942 and 20 August 1942, he learned to fly the [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] at the [[Jagdfliegerschule|''Jagdfliegerschule'' 2]] (Fighter Pilot School 2) in [[Zerbst/Anhalt]].{{sfn|Toliver|Constable|1986|p=296}}{{sfn|Kaplan|2007|p=90}}

Hartmann's time as a trainee pilot did not always go smoothly. On 31 March 1942, during a gunnery training flight, he ignored regulations and performed some [[aerobatics]] in his Bf&amp;nbsp;109 over the Zerbst airfield. His punishment was a week of confinement to quarters with the loss of ⅔ of his pay in fines. Hartmann later recalled that the incident saved his life:

&lt;blockquote&gt;That week confined to my room actually saved my life. I had been scheduled to go up on a gunnery flight the afternoon that I was confined. My roommate took the flight instead of me, in an aircraft I had been scheduled to fly. Shortly after he took off, while on his way to the gunnery range, he developed engine trouble and had to crash-land near the Hindenburg-Kattowitz railroad. He was killed in the crash.{{sfn|Kaplan|2007|p=90}}{{sfn|Toliver|Constable|1986|p=31}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Afterward, Hartmann practised diligently and adopted a new credo which he passed on to other young pilots: "Fly with your head, not with your muscles." During a gunnery practice session in June 1942, he hit a target [[drogue]] with 24 of the allotted 50 rounds of machine-gun fire, a feat that was considered difficult to achieve. His training had qualified him to fly 17 different types of powered aircraft, and, following his graduation, he was posted on 21 August 1942 to ''[[Ergänzungs-Jagdgruppe Ost]]'' (Supplementary Fighter  Group, East) in [[Gleiwitz]], [[Upper Silesia]], where he remained until 10 October 1942.{{sfn|Kaplan|2007|p=90}}

==World War II==
In October 1942, Hartmann was assigned to fighter wing [[Jagdgeschwader 52|''Jagdgeschwader'' 52]] (JG&amp;nbsp;52), based at [[Maykop]] on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] in the [[Soviet Union]]. The wing was equipped with the [[Messerschmitt Bf 109 variants#Bf 109G|Messerschmitt Bf 109G]], but Hartmann and several other pilots were initially given the task of ferrying Junkers Ju 87 Stukas down to [[Mariupol]]. His first flight ended with brake failure, causing the Stuka to crash into and destroy the controller's hut.{{sfn|Toliver|Constable|1986|pp=32–33}} Hartmann was assigned to III./JG&amp;nbsp;52,&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;For an explanation of ''Luftwaffe'' unit designations, see [[Organization of the Luftwaffe (1933–45)|Organisation of the ''Luftwaffe'' during World War II]].&lt;/ref&gt; led by ''[[Gruppenkommandeur]]'' [[Major (Germany)|Major]] [[Hubertus von Bonin]], and placed under the experienced ''[[Oberfeldwebel]]'' [[Edmund Roßmann|Edmund "Paule" Roßmann]], although he also flew with such experienced pilots as [[Alfred Grislawski]], [[Hans Dammers]] and [[Josef Zwernemann]]. After a few days of intensive mock combats and practice flights, Grislawski conceded that, although Hartmann had much to learn regarding combat tactics, he was quite a talented pilot. Paule Roßmann taught Hartmann the fundamentals of the surprise attack, a tactic that led to his "See – Decide – Attack – Break" style of aerial combat.{{sfn|Toliver|Constable|1986|pp=46–47, 54, 61, 84}}

===Early aerial combat===
Hartmann flew his first combat mission on 14 October 1942 as Roßmann's wingman. When they encountered 10 enemy aircraft below, Hartmann, obsessed by the idea of scoring his first success, opened full throttle and became separated from Roßmann. He engaged an enemy fighter, but failed to score any hits and nearly collided with it instead. He then ran for cover in low cloud, and his mission subsequently ended with a crash landing after his aircraft ran out of fuel. Hartmann had violated almost every rule of air-to-air combat, and von Bonin sentenced him to three days of working with the ground crew. Twenty-two days later, Hartmann claimed his first kill, an [[Ilyushin Il-2]] ''Sturmovik'' of the 7th Guards Ground Attack Aviation Regiment, but by the end of 1942, he had added only one more victory to his tally. As with many high-scoring aces, it took him some time to establish himself as a consistently successful fighter pilot.{{sfn|Deac|1998|p=30}}
Hartmann's success came gradually. He claimed four victories in April 1943 and six in May.{{sfn|Toliver|Constable|1986|pp=290–291}}

Hartmann's youthful appearance earned him the nickname "Bubi" (the [[hypocoristic]] form of "young boy" in the [[German language]]), and [[Walter Krupinski]], to whom Hartmann was assigned as wingman, would constantly urge him: "Hey, Bubi, get in closer".{{sfn|Toliver|Constable|1986|p=54}} He also received the nickname "the Blond Knight of Germany".&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1986-01-03/news/mn-23807_1_german-air-force German Pilot Reported 352 Kills : Hope of Top WWII Flier: No Need for New Air Aces] January 03, 1986 | WILLIAM TUOHY | Times Staff Writer&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 May 1943, he shot down a [[Lavochkin La-5]], before colliding with another Soviet fighter. He retained control of his damaged aircraft.{{sfn|Kurowski|1996|p=177}} On 5 July Hartmann claimed four victories.{{sfn|Toliver|Constable|1986|pp=290–291}} Two days later, during the large dogfights that took place during the [[Battle of Kursk]], he shot down seven enemy aircraft.{{sfn|Toliver|Constable|1986|pp=290–291}} On 8 and 9 July 1943 he claimed four on each day. The vast majority of the aircraft claimed were Lavochkin La-5s.{{sfn|Toliver|Constable|1986|pp=290–291}} The German offensive was terminated on 16 July, by which time Hartmann had accounted for 38 Soviet aircraft.{{sfn|Toliver|Constable|1986|pp=290–291}}

At the start of August 1943, his tally stood at 42, but Hartmann's tally had more than doubled by the end.{{sfn|Williamson|2006|p=45}} The [[Red Army]] began a counteroffensive in the region to contain the German operation and destroy its forces ([[Operation Kutuzov]] and [[Operation Polkovodets Rumyantsev]]). JG&amp;nbsp;52 was engaged in defensive operations throughout the month. On 1 August 1943 Hartmann became an ace-in-a day by claiming five victories. Another four followed on 3 August and five on the 4 August. Another five were claimed destroyed on the 5 August, a single on the 6 August, and a further five on 7 August. On 8 and 9 August he claimed another four Soviet fighters. Hartmann's last claim of the month came on the 20th, when he accounted for an IL-2 for his 90th victory.{{sfn|Toliver|Constable|1986|pp=290–291}} The next month, he was appointed ''[[Staffelkapitän]]'' of ''9./JG&amp;nbsp;52''.{{sfn|Williamson|2006|p=45}}

In his first year of operational service, Hartmann felt a distinct lack of respect towards Soviet pilots. Most Soviet fighters did not even have proper gunsights, and their pilots were forced to draw one on the windscreen by hand: "In the early days, incredible as it may seem, there was no reason for you to feel fear if the Russian fighter was behind you. With their hand-painted gunsights they couldn't pull the lead properly (deflection shooting) or hit you."{{sfn|Kaplan|2007|p=93}} Hartmann also considered the [[Bell P-39 Airacobra]], the [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk]], and the [[Hawker Hurricane]] to be inferior to the [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190]] and Bf&amp;nbsp;109, although they did provide the Soviets with valuable gunsight technology.{{sfn|Kaplan|2007|p=93}}

Hartmann said the German pilots themselves still learned from their enemy. Oil freezing in the [[Daimler-Benz DB 605|DB 605]] engines of the Bf&amp;nbsp;109G-6s made them difficult to start in the extreme cold of the [[Russian Winter|Russian winter]]. A captured Soviet airman showed them how pouring fuel into the aircraft's [[Sump|oil sump]] would thaw the oil and enable the engine to start on the first try. Another solution, also learned from the Soviets, was to ignite fuel under the engine.{{sfn|Kaplan|2007|p=104}}

===Fighting techniques===
[[File:Messerschmitt Me109G.jpg|thumb|Hartmann flew a [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] fighter.]]

Unlike [[Hans-Joachim Marseille]], who was a marksman and expert in the art of [[deflection shooting]], Hartmann was a master of stalk-and-ambush tactics. By his own account, he was convinced that 80% of the pilots he downed did not even realise what hit them. He relied on the powerful engine of his Bf&amp;nbsp;109 for high-power sweeps and quick approaches, occasionally diving through entire enemy formations to take advantage of the confusion that followed in order to disengage.

When the decorated British test pilot Captain [[Eric Brown (pilot)|Eric Brown]] asked Hartmann how he had amassed 352 air victories, he revealed:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Well you can't believe it, but the ''[[Sturmovik]]'', which was their main ground-attack aircraft, flew like [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17]]s in formation and didn't attempt to make any evasive manoeuvres. And all they had was one peashooter in the back of each plane. Also, some of the pilots were women. Their peashooter was no threat unless they had a very lucky hit on you. I didn't open fire till the aircraft filled my whole windscreen. If I did this, I would get one every time.{{sfn|Thompson|Smith|2008|p=235}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
His preferred method of attack  was to hold fire until extremely close ({{convert|20|m|ft|abbr=on}} or less), then unleash a short burst at point-blank range—a technique he learned while flying as wingman of his former commander, Walter Krupinski, who favoured this approach. This technique, as opposed to long-range shooting, allowed him to:
* Reveal his position only at the last possible moment
* Compensate for the low muzzle velocity of the slower-firing 30&amp;nbsp;mm [[MK 108 cannon|MK 108]] equipping some of the later Bf&amp;nbsp;109 models (though most of his victories were claimed with Messerschmitts equipped with the high-velocity 20mm [[MG 151 cannon]])
* Place his shots accurately with minimum waste of ammunition
* Prevent the adversary from taking evasive action{{sfn|Toliver|Constable|1986|pp=46–47, 54, 61, 84}}{{sfn|Spick|1996|p=201}}

Firing at close range ran the risk of having to fly through the debris of a damaged or exploding aircraft, thereby damaging his own fighter in the process (much of the damage Hartmann sustained in combat was caused by collision with flying debris). If it was dangerous to dog-fight further he would break off and content himself with one victory. His careful approach was described by himself by the motto: "See–Decide–Attack–Reverse"; observe the enemy, decide how to proceed with the attack, make the attack, and then disengage to re-evaluate the situation.{{sfn|Toliver|Constable|1986|pp=46–47, 54, 61, 84}}

===Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross===
By late August 1943, Hartmann had 90 aerial victories. On 19 August, in combat with Il-2s, his aircraft was damaged by debris, and he was forced to land behind Soviet lines. Hartmann's ''[[Geschwaderkommodore]]'', [[Dietrich Hrabak]], had given orders to Hartmann's unit to support the dive bombers of ''[[Sturzkampfgeschwader 2]]'', led by the famous ''Stuka'' pilot [[Hans-Ulrich Rudel]] in a counter-attack. The situation had changed, and the flight of eight German fighters engaged a mass of Soviet [[Yakovlev Yak-9]] and Lavochkin La-5 fighter aircraft that were protecting Il-2 ''Sturmoviks'' on a ground-attack mission. Hartmann shot down two enemy aircraft before his fighter was hit by debris and he was forced to make an emergency landing. He then, in accordance with ''Luftwaffe'' regulations, attempted to recover the precision board clock. As he was doing so, Soviet ground troops approached. Realising that capture was unavoidable, he faked internal injuries. Hartmann's acting so convinced the Soviets that they put him on a stretcher and placed him on a truck. When Hartmann's Crew Chief, Heinz "Bimmel" Mertens, heard what had happened, he took a rifle and went to search for Hartmann.{{sfn|Kaplan|2007|p=102}}

Hartmann patiently waited for the right moment to escape, then, using the distraction of the ''Stukas'' attack, he attacked the single guard. Hartmann jumped out of the back of the truck and ran into a large field of giant sunflowers. Evading the pursuing soldiers, Hartmann hid and waited for nightfall. In the dark, Hartmann followed a Soviet patrol heading west to the front. As he approached the German position, he was challenged by a sentry who fired a shot which passed through his trousers.{{sfn|Toliver|Constable|1986|pp=64–77}}

[[File:9-JG52-ins.svg|thumb|left|upright|''Karaya-Staffel'' emblem]]
On 20 September 1943, Hartmann was credited with his 100th aerial victory—he claimed four this day to end it on 101.{{sfn|Toliver|Constable|1986|pp=291–292}} He was the 54th ''Luftwaffe'' pilot to achieve the century mark.{{sfn|Obermaier|1989|p=243}} In October 1943, Hartmann claimed another 33 aerial victories.{{sfn|Deac|1998|p=34}} On 2 and 12 October he accounted for four victories and achieved a treble on 14, 15 and 20 October and double claims on 24, 25 and 29 October.{{sfn|Toliver|Constable|1986|pp=291–293}} On 29 October, he was awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]] ({{lang|de|Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes}}), at which point his tally stood at 148. By the end of the year, this had risen to 159.{{sfn|Deac|1998|p=34}}

In the first two months of 1944, Hartmann claimed over 50 Soviet aircraft.{{sfn|Weal|2001|p=73}} This included 25 in January.{{sfn|Toliver|Constable|1986|pp=291–293}} On 26 February 1944 he claimed 10 fighters shot down, all of them Soviet-flown P-39s.{{sfn|Toliver|Constable|1986|pp=291–292}} Hartmann continued scoring at an even greater pace. His spectacular rate of success raised a few eyebrows even in the [[Oberkommando der Luftwaffe|''Luftwaffe'' High Command]]; his claims were double and triple-checked, and his performance closely monitored by an observer flying in his formation. On 2 March, he reached 202.{{sfn|Weal|2001|p=73}}

By this time, the Soviet pilots were familiar with Hartmann's radio call sign of ''Karaya 1'', and the Soviet Command had put a price of 10,000 [[ruble]]s on the German pilot's head.{{sfn|Kaplan|2007|p=104}} Hartmann, for a time, used a black [[tulip]] design around the [[Cowling|engine cowling]] near the [[Spinner (aircraft)|spinner]] of his aircraft, so Soviet personnel consequently nicknamed him ''Cherniy Chort'' ("Black Devil"). Hartmann's opponents were often reluctant to stay and fight if they noticed his personal design. As a result, this aircraft was often allocated to novices, who could fly it in relative safety. On 21 March, it was Hartmann who scored JG&amp;nbsp;52{{'}}s 3,500th victory of the war.{{sfn|Weal|2001|p=74}} Adversely, the reluctance of the Soviet airmen to fight caused Hartmann's kill rate to drop. Hartmann then had the tulip design removed, and his aircraft painted just like the rest of his unit. Consequently, in the following two months, Hartmann amassed over 50 victories.{{sfn|Kaplan|2007|pp=104–105}}

In March 1944, Hartmann, [[Gerhard Barkhorn]], [[Walter Krupinski]] and [[Johannes Wiese]] were summoned to [[Adolf Hitler]]'s [[Berghof (Hitler)|''Berghof'']] in [[Berchtesgaden]]. Barkhorn was to be honoured with the Swords, while Hartmann, Krupinski and Wiese were to receive the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves]] ({{lang|de|Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub}}). On the train, all four of them got drunk on cognac and champagne. Supporting each other and unable to stand, they arrived at Berchtesgaden. ''Major'' [[Nicolaus von Below]], Hitler's ''Luftwaffe'' adjutant, was shocked. After some sobering up, Hartmann was still intoxicated. Hartmann took a German officer's hat from a stand and put it on, but it was too large. Von Below became upset, told Hartmann it was Hitler's and ordered him to put it back.{{sfn|Toliver|Constable|1986|pp=9–11}} During his meeting with Hitler, Hartmann was critical of German pilot training and the failure of the training program to prepare them for combat. He also mentioned the high loss rates and improved Soviet aviation. What impact these remarks had on Hitler is unknown.{{sfn|Toliver|Constable|1986|pp=291–292}}

===Diamonds to the Knight's Cross===
In April and May 1944, 9./JG&amp;nbsp;52 resisted the Soviet [[Crimean Offensive]]. In April Hartmann claimed five victories. In May, Hartmann filed claims number 208 to 231 which included six on the 6 May. On 8 May 1944, JG&amp;nbsp;52 fled the region as the German defence collapsed. Hartmann flew out with two mechanics crammed into the fuselage of his Bf&amp;nbsp;109. JG&amp;nbsp;52 subsequently took part in the defeat of the Soviet [[First Jassy–Kishinev Offensive]] on the [[Romania]]n-Soviet border.{{sfn|Toliver|Constable|1986|pp=293–294}}

On 21 May 1944, Hartmann engaged [[United States Army Air Forces]] aircraft in [[Defence of the Reich|''Reichsverteidigung'']] for the first time in defence of the [[Ploiești]] oilfields. While flying "top cover" for another ''Schwarm'', Hartmann attacked a flight of four [[North American P-51 Mustang|P-51]]s over [[Bucharest]], [[Romania]], downing two, while the other two P-51s fell victim to his fellow pilots.{{sfn|Kaplan|2007|p=115}}{{sfn|Toliver|Constable|1986|pp=161–166}} On 1 June 1944, Hartmann shot down four P-51s in a single mission over the [[Ploieşti]] oil fields.{{sfn|Toliver|Constable|1985|pp=177–182, 339}}

Later that month, during his fifth combat with American pilots, he shot down two more P-51s before being forced to bail out, when eight other P-51s ran his Messerschmitt out of fuel. During the intense manoeuvring, Hartmann managed to line up one of the P-51s at close range, but heard only a "clank" when he fired, as he had run out of ammunition.{{sfn|Kaplan|2007|p=115}}{{sfn|Toliver|Constable|1986|p=165–169}} While he was hanging in his parachute, the P-51s circled above him, and Hartmann wondered if they would take this opportunity to kill him. One of the P-51Bs flown by Lt. Robert J. Goebel of the 308th Squadron, [[31st Fighter Group]], broke away and headed straight for him.{{sfn|Tillman|2006|p=54}} Goebel was making a camera pass to record the bailout and banked away from him only at the last moment, waving at Hartmann as he went by.{{sfn|Kaplan|2007|p=116}}

On 17 August, Hartmann became the top scoring fighter ace, surpassing fellow JG&amp;nbsp;52 pilot Gerhard Barkhorn, with his 274th victory.{{refn|Sources regarding the exact number of P-51 Mustang victories are inconclusive and vary between seven and eight. Toliver and Constable give the impression that eight kills are probable, while other sources speak of seven victories.|group="Note"}}On 23 August, Hartmann claimed eight victories in three combat missions, an [[Aviators who became ace in a day|ace-in-a-day]] achievement, bringing his score to 290 victories.{{sfn|Weal|2001|p=78}} He passed the 300-mark on 24 August 1944, a day on which he shot down 11 aircraft in two combat missions, representing his greatest ever victories-per-day ratio (a double-ace-in-a-day) and bringing the number of aerial victories to an unprecedented 301. He was immediately grounded by ''[[Reichsmarschall]]'' [[Hermann Göring]], who was fearful of the effect on German morale should such a hero be lost. Hartmann later successfully lobbied to be reinstated as a combat pilot.{{sfn|Toliver|Constable|1986|pp=142–144}}

Hartmann became one of only 27 German soldiers in World War II to receive the Diamonds to his Knight's Cross.{{sfn|Weal|2001|p=71}} Hartmann was summoned to the ''[[Wolfsschanze|Führerhauptquartier Wolfsschanze]]'', Adolf Hitler's military headquarters near [[Kętrzyn|Rastenburg]], to receive the coveted award from Hitler personally. On arrival, he was asked to surrender his [[side arm]] — a security measure caused by the aftermath of the failed [[20 July plot|assassination attempt]] on 20 July 1944. Hartmann refused and threatened to decline the Diamonds if he were not trusted to carry his pistol. After consulting ''[[Oberst]]'' Nicolaus von Below, Hitler's ''Luftwaffe'' adjutant, Hartmann was allowed to keep his side arm and accepted the Diamonds.{{sfn|Toliver|Constable|1986|pp=142–143}} During Hartmann's meeting with Hitler, Hartmann discussed at length the shortcomings of fighter pilot training. Allegedly, Hitler revealed to Hartmann that he believed that, "militarily, the war is lost," and that he wished the ''Luftwaffe'' had "more like him and [[Hans-Ulrich Rudel|Rudel]]."{{sfn|Weal|2001|p=79}}

[[File:Messerschmitt Bf 109 610937 at the Evergreen Aviation &amp; Space Museum.jpg|thumb|right|Bf-109 in the Hartmann color scheme on display at the [[Evergreen Aviation &amp; Space Museum]]]]
The Diamonds to the Knight's Cross also earned Hartmann a 10-day leave. On his way to his vacation, he was ordered by ''[[General der Jagdflieger]]'' [[Adolf Galland]] to attend a meeting in Berlin-Gatow. Galland wanted to transfer Hartmann to the [[Messerschmitt Me 262]] test program. Hartmann requested that the transfer be cancelled on the grounds of his deep attachment to JG&amp;nbsp;52. Galland, valuing comradeship and seeing the merit in Hartmann's request, cancelled the transfer to the jet squadron and rescinded the order that had taken him off combat operations. Galland then ordered Hartmann to the ''Jagdfliegerheim'' (vacation resort for fighter pilots) in [[Bad Wiessee]],{{sfn|Toliver|Constable|1985|p=148}} where, on 10 September, Hartmann married his long-time teenage love, Ursula "Usch" Paetsch. Witnesses to the wedding included his friends Gerhard Barkhorn and [[Wilhelm Batz]].{{sfn|Hartmann|Jäger|1992|pp=139–145}}

===Last combat missions===
From 1–14 February 1945, Hartmann briefly led I. ''Gruppe'' of [[Jagdgeschwader 53|''Jagdgeschwader'' 53]] as acting ''Gruppenkommandeur'' until he was replaced by [[Helmut Lipfert]]. In March 1945, Hartmann, his score now standing at 336 aerial victories, was asked a second time by General Adolf Galland to join the Me&amp;nbsp;262 units forming to fly the new jet fighter. Hartmann attended the jet conversion program led by [[Heinrich Bär]]. Galland also intended Hartmann to fly with [[Jagdverband 44|''Jagdverband'' 44]]. Hartmann declined the offer, preferring to remain with JG&amp;nbsp;52. Some sources report that Hartmann's decision to stay with his unit was due to a request via [[telegram]] made by ''[[Oberstleutnant]]'' [[Hermann Graf]].{{sfn|Weal|2001|p=82}} Now ''Gruppenkommandeur'' of I./JG&amp;nbsp;52, Erich Hartmann claimed his 350th aerial victory on 17 April, in the vicinity of [[Chrudim]]. The last wartime photograph of Hartmann known was taken in connection with this victory.{{sfn|Weal|2004|p=119}}

At the end of the war, Erich Hartmann disobeyed General [[Hans Seidemann]]'s order to Hartmann and Hermann Graf to fly to the British sector to avoid capture by Soviet forces. Hartmann later explained:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I must say that during the war I never disobeyed an order, but when General Seidemann ordered Graf and me to fly to the British sector and surrender to avoid the Soviets, with the rest of the wing to surrender to the Soviets, I could not leave my men.  That would have been bad leadership.&lt;ref name="Colin Heaton"&gt;{{Cite web |work=Aces of WW2 |title=Hartmann Interview |last=Heaton |first=Colin |url=http://www.acesofww2.com/germany/aces/hartmann |accessdate =14 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hartmann's last kill occurred over [[Brno]], [[Czechoslovakia]], on 8 May, the last day of the war in Europe. Early that morning, he was ordered to fly a reconnaissance mission and report the position of Soviet forces. Hartmann took off with his wingman at 08:30 and spotted the first Soviet units just {{Convert|40|km|mi|abbr=off}} away. Passing over the area, Hartmann saw two Yak-9s performing aerobatics for the Soviet columns. Determined to "spoil the party", Hartmann dove upon the fighters from his vantage point at {{convert|12000|ft|m|abbr=on}} and shot one down from a range of {{convert|200|ft|m|abbr=on}}. As he lined up the second fighter, Hartmann noticed a flicker of shiny dots above him coming from the West; they were P-51s. Rather than make a stand and be caught between the Soviets and the Americans, Hartmann and his wingman fled at low level into the pall of smoke that covered Brno.{{sfn|Kaplan|2007|p=117}} When he landed, Hartmann learned that the Soviet forces were within artillery range of the airfield, so JG&amp;nbsp;52 destroyed ''Karaya'' One, 24 other Bf&amp;nbsp;109s, and large quantities of ammunition. Hartmann later recalled his final violent action of the war:
&lt;blockquote&gt;We destroyed the aircraft and all munitions, everything. I sat in my fighter and fired the guns into the woods where all the fuel had been dropped, and then jumped out. We destroyed twenty-five perfectly good fighters. They would be nice to have in museums now.&lt;ref name="Colin Heaton"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As ''Gruppenkommandeur'' of I./JG&amp;nbsp;52, Hartmann chose to surrender his unit to members of the [[90th Infantry Division (United States)|US 90th Infantry Division]].{{sfn|Kaplan|2007|pp=118–119}}

==Prisoner of war==
After his capture, the U.S. Army handed Hartmann, his pilots, and ground crew over to the Soviet Union on 14 May, where he was imprisoned in accordance with the [[Yalta Conference#Major points|Yalta Agreements]], which stated that airmen and soldiers fighting Soviet forces had to surrender directly to them. Hartmann and his unit were led by the Americans to a large open-air compound to await the transfer. The number of prisoners grew to 50,000. Living conditions deteriorated, and some American guards turned a blind eye to escapes. In some cases they assisted by providing food and maps.{{sfn|Kaplan|2007|p=118}}

Hartmann embarked on a prisoner train eastward. Travelling via [[Vienna]], [[Budapest]], across the [[Carpathian Mountains]] into [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukraine]], [[Kiev]], [[Moscow]] and finally [[Kirov, Kirov Oblast|Kirov]].{{sfn|Toliver|Constable|1986|p=206}} Initially, the Soviets tried to convince Hartmann to cooperate with them. He was asked to spy on fellow officers and become a ''stukatch'', or "stool pigeon". He refused and was given 10 days' solitary confinement in a four-by-nine-by-six-foot chamber. He slept on a concrete floor and was given only bread and water. On another occasion, the Soviets threatened to kidnap and murder his wife (the death of his son was kept from Hartmann). During similar interrogations about his knowledge of the Me 262, Hartmann was struck by a Soviet officer using a cane, prompting Hartmann to slam his chair down on the head of the assailant, knocking him out. Expecting to be shot, he was transferred back to the small bunker.{{sfn|Kaplan|2007|p=121}}

Hartmann, not ashamed of his war service, opted to go on a hunger strike and starve rather than fold to "Soviet will", as he called it.{{sfn|Kaplan|2007|p=120}} The Soviets allowed the hunger strike to go on for four days before force-feeding him. More subtle efforts by the Soviet authorities to convert Hartmann to [[communism]] also failed. He was offered a post in the [[Air Forces of the National People's Army|East German Air Force]], which he refused:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If, after I am home in the West, you make me a normal contract offer, a business deal such as people sign every day all over the world, and I like your offer, then I will come back and work with you in accordance with the contract. But if you try to put me to work under coercion of any kind, then I will resist to my dying gasp.{{sfn|Kaplan|2007|p=121}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===War crimes charges===
During his captivity Hartmann was first arrested on 24 December 1949, and three days later, he was sentenced to 20 years in prison.{{sfn|Wagenlehner|1999|p=36}} In June 1951 he was sentenced as an alleged member of an anti-Soviet group.{{sfn|Wagenlehner|1999|p=36}}

After continuous failed attempts by the Soviets to break him, Hartmann was charged with war crimes, specifically the "deliberate shooting of 780 Soviet civilians" in the village of [[Briansk]], attacking a "bread factory" on 23 May 1943, and destroying 345 "expensive" Soviet aircraft.{{sfn|Kaplan|2007|p=122}} He refused to confess to these charges and conducted his own defence, which the presiding judge denounced as a "waste of time".{{sfn|Kaplan|2007|p=122}}

Sentenced to 25 years of [[Forced labor of Germans in the Soviet Union|hard labor]], he refused to work. He was eventually put into solitary confinement, which enraged his fellow prisoners. They began a revolt, overpowered the guards, and freed him. He made a complaint to the ''Kommandant''{{'}}s office, asking for a representative from Moscow and an international inspection, as well as a tribunal, to acquit him of his unlawful conviction. This was refused, and he was transferred to a camp in [[Novocherkassk]], where he spent five more months in solitary confinement. Eventually he was granted a tribunal, but it upheld his original sentence. He was subsequently sent to another camp, this time at Diaterka in the [[Ural Mountains]].{{sfn|Kaplan|2007|p=122–123}}

In 1955, Hartmann's mother wrote to the new [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|West German Chancellor]], [[Konrad Adenauer]], to whom she appealed to secure his freedom. A trade agreement between West Germany and the Soviet Union was reached, and Hartmann was released along with 16,000 German military personnel as one of the last ''[[Heimkehrer]]''. After spending 10 and a half years in Soviet [[POW]] camps, he was among the last batch of prisoners to be turned over.{{sfn|Toliver|Constable|1986|pp=255–256}} He refused a celebration for his arrival until all German prisoners were released by the Soviets, which happened later that year.&lt;ref name="articles.latimes.com"&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1986-01-03/news/mn-23807_1_german-air-force/3 German Pilot Reported 352 Kills : Hope of Top WWII Flier: No Need for New Air Aces] January 03, 1986 | WILLIAM TUOHY | Times Staff Writer&lt;/ref&gt; Returning to West Germany, he was reunited with his wife Ursula, to whom he had written every day of the war.{{sfn|Toliver|Constable|1986|pp=255–256}}

In January 1997, the [[Government of Russia|government of the Russian Federation]], acting as the [[Succession of states|legal successor]] to the Soviet Union, exonerated Hartmann by admitting that his conviction for war crimes was unlawful.{{sfn|Berger|1999|p=107}}

==Post-war years==
[[File:Canadair Sabre Berlin Luftwaffen Museum.JPG|thumb|left|''[[German Air Force]]'' [[Canadair Sabre]] in the Hartmann "black tulip" color scheme at the [[Militärhistorisches Museum Flugplatz Berlin-Gatow|Bundeswehr Museum of Military History]]]]

During his long imprisonment, Hartmann's son, Erich-Peter, was born in 1945 and died as a three-year-old in 1948, without his father ever having seen him. Hartmann later had a daughter, Ursula Isabel, born on 23 February 1957.{{sfn|Kaplan|2007|p=125}} When Hartmann returned to West Germany, he reentered military service in the ''[[Bundeswehr]]'' and became an officer in the West [[German Air Force]], where he commanded West Germany's first all-jet unit, [[Taktisches Luftwaffengeschwader 71 "Richthofen"|''Jagdgeschwader 71'' "Richthofen"]], which was equipped initially with [[Canadair Sabre]]s and later with [[Lockheed F-104 Starfighter]]s. He also made several trips to the United States, where he was trained on [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] equipment. He had the JG&amp;nbsp;71 aircraft painted with the same spreading black tulip pattern used by ''Karaya 1'' on the Eastern Front.{{sfn|Toliver|Constable|1985|p=278}} Due to his association with the new ''Luftwaffe'', whose pilots received training in the United States, Hartmann avoided the taint some other German pilots developed after the war because of their continued relations with Nazi sympathizers.&lt;ref name="articles.latimes.com"/&gt;

Hartmann considered the F-104 a fundamentally flawed and unsafe aircraft and strongly opposed its adoption by the air force. Although events subsequently validated his low opinion of the aircraft (282 crashes and 115 German pilots killed on the F-104 in non-combat missions, along with allegations of bribes culminating in the [[Lockheed bribery scandals|Lockheed scandal]]), Hartmann's outspoken criticism proved unpopular with his superiors. General [[Werner Panitzki]], successor to General [[Josef Kammhuber]] as the [[Inspector of the Air Force]], said, "Erich is a good pilot, but not a good officer." Hartmann was forced into early retirement in 1970.{{sfn|Toliver|Constable|1985|pp=285–286}} Already in 1957, Hartmann had recommended to Kammhuber to first buy and evaluate a few new and unfamiliar aircraft before committing the air force to a new aircraft type.{{sfn|Der Spiegel Volume 35/1982}}

After his military retirement, from 1971–74, Hartmann worked as a [[flight instructor]] in Hangelar, near [[Bonn]], and also flew in an aerobatics team with Adolf Galland. In 1980 he caught a cold that developed into [[angina pectoris]], the condition that had killed his father at the age of 58. He recovered and, by 1983, was medically cleared to fly, after which he resumed instructing at the various flying schools. Fearing a second attack, he became cautious and limited his appearances at public events.  He stated: "I am retired and I am a civilian, and now I like to have my rest and peace.  I do not live for exhibitions."{{sfn|Toliver|Constable|1986|p=289}} 

Hartmann died on 20 September 1993, at the age of 71 in Weil im Schönbuch.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;{{Find a Grave|20062}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
{{Main|The Blond Knight of Germany}}

Hartmann was the subject of a biography by the American authors  [[Trevor J. Constable]] and Raymond F. Toliver, under the title ''[[The Blond Knight of Germany]]''. Originally released in the United States in 1970, it was published in Germany the next year, as ''Holt Hartmann vom Himmel!'' ("''Shoot Hartmann down!''").{{sfn|Notheisen|2017}}

''The Blond Knight'' was a commercial success and enjoyed a wide readership among both the American and the German public. The book has been criticised as ahistorical and misleading in recent American and German historiography. [[Ronald Smelser]] and [[Edward J. Davies]], in their work ''[[The Myth of the Eastern Front]]'', describe it as one of the key works that promoted the [[Clean Wehrmacht|myth of the "clean Wehrmacht"]].{{sfn|Smelser|Davies|2008|pp=170–173}}

The historian Jens Wehner notes that the German-language version of the book was immensely popular in Germany, but contained serious flaws in its presentation of historical realities. These included uncritical borrowing from the Nazi propaganda elements of the ''Fliegerasse'' ("[[ace (military)|ace]]s") and stereotypes about the Soviet Union. According to Wehner, the latter could be traced to the prevailing attitudes during the [[Cold War]]. Further, the political and social consequences of World War II were completely ignored.{{sfn|Notheisen|2017}}

==Summary of career==

===Combat record===
Hartmann flew 1,404 combat missions during World War II, resulting in 825 engagements and 352 claimed and credited aerial victories against Allied aircraft.{{sfn|Toliver|Constable|1985|p=340}} One Russian historian, [[Dimitri Khazanov]], has attempted to prove that Hartmann did not score anywhere near 352 victories. Khazanov quoted Hartmann having shot down 70-80 Soviet aircraft. Khazanov has been heavily criticised by aviation historians such as [[Jean-Yves Lorant]] and [[Hans Ring]] for faulty research. Ring and Lorant both point out that the missions that Khazanov tried to use to prove Hartmann's claims false were riddled with false and misleading information. For example, Khazanov claimed that on a mission on 20 August 1943, Hartmann claimed two victories west of [[Millerovo]] but not a single Soviet aircraft was lost. German records show not a single claim was made in that area. Hartmann's victories were recorded east of Kuteinikowo, some {{Convert|160|km|mi|abbr=on}} away.&lt;ref name="Khazanov"&gt;{{Cite web|work=members.aol.com |title=Criticism of Dimitri Khazanov |url=http://members.aol.com/falkeeins/Sturmgruppen/hartmannclaims.html |accessdate=3 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070526032108/http://members.aol.com/falkeeins/Sturmgruppen/hartmannclaims.html |archivedate=26 May 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 May 1944, Khazanov claimed Hartmann reported three La-5s shot down over Roman, [[Romania]]. This was also false. Hartmann claimed a single P-39 over [[Iaşi]].&lt;ref name="Khazanov"/&gt; Hans Ring said the mistakes in Khazanov's work "serve to expose the superficial nature of Khazanov's assertions and confirm that his only goal in compiling his article was to discredit Hartmann and his record."&lt;ref name="Khazanov"/&gt; Even Khazanov points out in his article that during Hartmann's show trial, one of the Soviet charges was the destruction of 352 (the actual number was 345) Soviet aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|work=hartmannerich.com |title=Erich Hartmann's kills |url=http://www.hartmannerich.com/?page_id=9 |accessdate=3 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110902010742/http://www.hartmannerich.com/?page_id=9 |archivedate=2 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is often said that Hartmann was more proud of the fact that he had never lost a [[wingman]] in combat than he was about his number of kills; he did have at least one shot down. Major Günther Capito had joined the unit in early 1943. Capito was a former bomber pilot who had retrained on fighters. After scoring his fifth victory, Capito asked to be Hartmann's wingman. Hartmann refused initially, believing Capito was insufficiently trained on Messerschmitts. On their first mission together, they were engaged by [[P-39 Airacobra]]s:{{sfn|Toliver|Constable|1986|pp=57–58}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;I called to him to turn hard opposite, so I could sandwich the Red fighters, but in his standard-rate bomber turn he got hit. I saw the whole thing and ordered him to dive and bail out immediately. To my intense relief I saw him leave the aircraft and his parachute blossom. I was happy to get this Airacobra, but I was mad at myself for not harkening to my intuition not to fly with Günther Capito.{{sfn|Kaplan|2007|p=100}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Aerial victory claims===
Matthews and Foreman, authors of ''Luftwaffe Aces – Biographies and Victory Claims'', researched the [[German Federal Archives]] and found records for 352 aerial victory claims, plus two further unconfirmed claims. This number includes two claims over [[United States Army Air Forces]] flown P-51 Mustangs, and 350 [[Soviet Air Forces]] piloted aircraft on the Eastern Front.{{sfn|Matthews|Foreman|2015|pp=485–492}}

Victory claims were logged to a map-reference (PQ = ''Planquadrat''), for example "PQ 44793". The ''Luftwaffe'' grid map ({{lang|de|Jägermeldenetz}}) covered all of Europe, western Russia and North Africa and was composed of rectangles measuring 15 [[Minute of arc|minutes]] of [[latitude]] by 30 minutes of [[longitude]], an area of about {{Convert|360|sqmi|sqkm}}. These sectors were then subdivided into 36 smaller units to give a location area 3 × 4&amp;nbsp;km in size.{{sfn|''Planquadrat''}}

{{legend2|#fbec5d;|This and the ♠ ([[Ace of spades]]) indicates those aerial victories which made Hartmann an "[[Aviators who became ace in a day|ace-in-a-day]]", a term which designates a fighter pilot who has shot down five or more airplanes in a single day. |border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}&lt;br /&gt;
