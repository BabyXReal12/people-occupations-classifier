'''Buzz Aldrin''' (born '''Edwin Eugene Aldrin Jr.'''; January 20, 1930) is an American [[engineer]], former [[astronaut]], and [[Command Pilot Wings|Command Pilot]] in the [[United States Air Force]]. As [[Lunar Module]] Pilot on the [[Apollo 11]] mission, he and mission commander [[Neil Armstrong]] were the first two humans to [[Apollo 11 landing site|land on the Moon]]. Aldrin set foot on the [[Moon]] at 03:15:16 on July 21, 1969 ([[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]), 9 minutes after Armstrong first touched the surface. One of his first missions was on [[Gemini 12]] where he successfully proved that [[extravehicular activity]] (EVA) could be performed by astronauts, spending over 5 hours outside the craft, thus achieving the goals of the Gemini program and paving the way for the [[Apollo]] program.

== Early life ==
Aldrin was born January 20, 1930, in [[Mountainside Hospital]], in [[Glen Ridge, New Jersey|Glen Ridge]], [[New Jersey]].&lt;ref name="Record20090721"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.northjersey.com/news/national/other_national_news/To_the_moon_and_beyond.html |title=To the Moon and beyond|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110516123857/http://www.northjersey.com/news/national/other_national_news/To_the_moon_and_beyond.html |archive-date=May 16, 2011|dead-url=yes |publisher=[[The Record (Bergen County)]] |date=July 20, 2009|access-date=July 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hansen|2005|p=348}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents were Edwin Eugene Aldrin Sr. (1896–1974), a career military man, and Marion Aldrin (née Moon, 1903–1968), who lived in neighboring [[Montclair, New Jersey|Montclair]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.buzzaldrin.com/about/full/index.html |title=About Buzz Aldrin |accessdate=May 9, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080402060645/http://www.buzzaldrin.com/about/full/index.html |archivedate=April 2, 2008 |publisher=buzzaldrin.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/21/magazine/21fob-q4-t.html |title=Questions for Buzz Aldrin: The Man on the Moon |last=Solomon |first=Deborah |author2=Oth, Christian |date=June 21, 2009 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=March 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is of [[Scottish people|Scottish]],&lt;ref&gt;Powell, Sarah.{{cite web |url=http://www.burkespeerage.com/articles/scotland/saal7.aspx |title=From The Dollar To The Moon.

His nickname, which became his legal first name in 1988, arose as a result of the younger of his two elder sisters mispronouncing "brother" as "buzzer", which was shortened to Buzz.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chaikin|2007|p=585}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his childhood years, Aldrin was a [[Boy Scouting (Boy Scouts of America)|Boy Scout]] and earned the rank of [[Ranks in the Boy Scouts of America#Tenderfoot Scout|Tenderfoot Scout]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scouting.org/About/FactSheets/scouting_space.aspx |title=Scouting and Space Exploration |work=scouting.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304032406/http://www.scouting.org/about/factsheets/scouting_space.aspx |archivedate=March 4, 2016 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Military career ==
Aldrin graduated third in his class at West Point in 1951 with a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in [[mechanical engineering]]. He was commissioned as a [[US Second Lieutenant|second lieutenant]] in the [[United States Air Force]] and served as a jet [[fighter pilot]] during the [[Korean War]]. He flew 66 [[Aerial warfare|combat missions]] in [[F-86 Sabre]]s and shot down two [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15]] aircraft. The June 8, 1953, issue of ''Life'' magazine featured gun camera photos taken by Aldrin of one of the Soviet pilots ejecting from his damaged aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Communist Pilot is Catapulted from Crippled MIG |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3EcEAAAAMBAJ |accessdate=November 8, 2012 |date=June 8, 1953 |work=Life |publisher=Time Inc.|issn=0024-3019 |page=29|volume=34|issue=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, Aldrin was assigned as an [[Air gunner|aerial gunnery]] instructor at [[Nellis Air Force Base]] in [[Nevada]], and later served as an aide to the dean of faculty at the [[United States Air Force Academy]], which had begun operations in 1955.&lt;ref name="nasabio" /&gt; That same year, he graduated from the [[Squadron Officer School]] at [[Maxwell Air Force Base]] in [[Alabama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hansen|2005|p=353}}&lt;/ref&gt; He flew [[F-100 Super Sabre]]s as a flight commander in the [[22d Fighter Squadron]], while stationed at [[Bitburg Air Base]], West Germany.&lt;ref name="nasabio" /&gt;

Aldrin, under the auspices of the [[Air Force Institute of Technology]], began work as a graduate student at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) in 1959, intending to earn a master's degree. Aldrin enjoyed the classroom work, and soon decided to pursue a doctoral degree.&lt;ref name="Chaikin2007p139"&gt;{{harvnb|Chaikin|2007|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1963, he earned a [[Sc.D.]] degree in [[astronautics]].&lt;ref name="nasabio"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/htmlbios/aldrin-b.html |title=Astronaut Bio: Buzz Aldrin |work=NASA|access-date=August 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dspace.mit.edu"&gt;{{cite thesis|url=http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/12652|publisher=MIT|title=Line-of-sight guidance techniques for manned orbital rendezvous|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150511134459/http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/12652 |archivedate=May 11, 2015|date=1963|last=Aldrin|first=Buzz|type=Sc.D.}}&lt;/ref&gt; His doctoral thesis was ''Line-of-Sight Guidance Techniques for Manned Orbital Rendezvous'', the dedication of which read, "In the hopes that this work may in some way contribute to their exploration of space, this is dedicated to the crew members of this country’s present and future manned space programs. If only I could join them in their exciting endeavors!"&lt;ref name="dspace.mit.edu" /&gt; Aldrin chose his doctoral thesis on the basis that it would help him be selected as an astronaut.&lt;ref name="Chaikin2007p139" /&gt;

== NASA career ==
On the completion of his doctorate, Aldrin was assigned to the Gemini Target Office of the Air Force Space Systems Division in [[Los Angeles]]. His initial application to join the astronaut corps was rejected on the basis he was never a test pilot. With the removal of [[test pilot]] experience as a prerequisite for astronaut selection, Aldrin became eligible and in October 1963, he became a member of [[NASA]]'s [[Astronaut Group 3]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/roundups/issues/63-10-30.pdf |title=14 New Astronauts Introduced at Press Conference |publisher=NASA |date=October 30, 1963|access-date=April 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; His selection made him the first astronaut with a Ph.D. This, combined with his expertise in orbital mechanics, gave him the nickname Dr. Rendezvous.&lt;ref name="Chaikin2007p143"&gt;{{harvnb|Chaikin|2007|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gemini program ===
{{Main|Gemini 12}}
[[File:S66-63536.jpg|thumb|Another view of Aldrin in space, with the spacecraft and Earth]]

Aldrin and [[Jim Lovell]] were selected as the backup crew for Gemini 10, which lined them up for the prime crew of Gemini 13. With Gemini 12 scheduled as the last mission, this was a dead-end assignment. After the deaths of the original [[Gemini 9A|Gemini 9]] prime crew, [[Elliot See]] and [[Charles Bassett]], Aldrin and [[Jim Lovell]] were promoted to backup crew for the Gemini 9 mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hacker|Grimwood|1974|loc=Chapter 14-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; With normal crew rotation, this confirmed Aldrin's spot as a pilot on [[Gemini 12]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chaikin|2007|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gemini 12's main objectives were to perform an EVA, rendezvous with a target vehicle, and fly the two together using [[gravity-gradient stabilization]].&lt;ref name="nssdc"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1966-104A |title=Gemini 12 |publisher=NASA Space Science Data Coordinated Archive|access-date=August 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; While NASA had successfully performed rendezvous in the past, the gravity-gradient stabilization test on Gemini 11 was unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="Reichl2013p137"&gt;{{harvnb|Reichl|2013|p=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; NASA was also having problems with their EVAs. After [[Eugene Cernan]]'s near-disastrous EVA on Gemini 9, [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]] had a successful EVA on Gemini 10. However, [[Richard F. Gordon]] had trouble on Gemini 11 while trying to use the astronaut maneuvering unit (AMU), so it fell to Aldrin to achieve Gemini's EVA goal. NASA formed a committee to give Aldrin a better chance of success. They removed the AMU test so Aldrin could focus on the EVA.&lt;ref name="Reichl2013p137" /&gt; NASA revamped the training program, opting for underwater training over parabolic flight. They also placed additional handholds on the capsule, and created workstations that Aldrin could anchor his feet into.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Reichl|2013|p=138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lovell and Aldrin on Deck - GPN-2000-001356.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Aldrin and [[Jim Lovell]] after the Gemini 12 mission]]
The [[Gemini Agena Target Vehicle]] launched about an hour and a half prior to Gemini 12.&lt;ref name="nssdc" /&gt; The mission's first major objective was to rendezvous with this target vehicle. As the target and Gemini 12 capsule drew closer together, radar contact between the two deteriorated until it became unusable. The crew would have to rendezvous manually. Aldrin used a sextant and rendezvous charts he helped create to give Lovell the right information to put the spacecraft in position to mate with the target vehicle.&lt;ref name="Chaikin 2007 140"&gt;{{harvnb|Chaikin|2007|p=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lovell was unable to dock with the target, and Aldrin docked successfully a few minutes later.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Reichl|2013|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aldrin performed two EVAs; first a standup, and in the second he left the spacecraft. The standup EVA mimicked some of the actions he would do during his free-flight EVA, so he could compare the effort expended between the two. The standup EVA set a record of two hours and 20 minutes, and succeeded in accomplishing the work demonstration. The next day Aldrin performing his free-flight EVA. He climbed across the newly installed hand-holds to the GATV and installed the cable needed for the gravity-gradient stabilization experiment. Aldrin performed tasks like installing electrical connectors and testing tools needed later for Apollo.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Reichl|2013|pp=141–142}}&lt;/ref&gt; His second EVA concluded after two hours and six minutes.&lt;ref name="nssdc" /&gt; On November 15, the crew initiated the automatic reentry system and splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Reichl|2013|p=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, after the mission, his wife realized he had fallen into a depression, something she had not seen before.&lt;ref name="Chaikin 2007 140"/&gt;

=== Apollo program ===

On July 20, 1969, [[Apollo 11]] mission commander [[Neil Armstrong]] and Aldrin made the first lunar landing becoming the first and second people, respectively, to walk on the Moon. This mission allowed Aldrin to maintain his record EVA duration until it was surpassed in the [[Apollo 14]] mission. Aldrin's first words on the Moon were "Beautiful view", to which Armstrong asked "Isn't it magnificent?". Aldrin answered, "Magnificent desolation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration| editor-last=Teague|editor-first=Kipp |last3=Aldrin |first3=Buzz |date=July 21, 1969 |title=Apollo 11 – Buzz Aldrin Descends Ladder to Lunar Surface |url=https://history.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11v_1094228.mpg |accessdate=December 22, 2013 |format=MPEG-1 |at=48 seconds |quote=Beautiful view.

There has been speculation about the extent of Aldrin's desire at the time to be the first astronaut to walk on the Moon and its impact on his pre-flight, in-mission and post-flight actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |publisher=NASA |url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/pao/History/SP-350/cover.html |title=Apollo Expeditions to the Moon|editor-last=Cortright|editor-first=Edgar M. |chapter=8 |page=7|access-date=January 28, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080219204538/https://history.nasa.gov/SP-350/ch-9-5.html|archive-date=February 19, 2008|dead-url=no |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to various NASA accounts, early versions of the EVA checklist had the Lunar Module Pilot as the first to step onto the lunar surface. However, when Aldrin learned that this might be amended, he lobbied within NASA for the original procedure to be followed. A number of factors seem to have contributed to the final decision, including the physical positioning of the astronauts within the compact lunar lander, which made it easier for Armstrong to be the first to exit the spacecraft. Furthermore, there was little support for Aldrin's views among other senior astronauts who would command later Apollo missions, and who may have been the first to make a lunar landing had Apollo 11 failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/manonmoonv00chai|title=A man on the moon : the voyages of the Apollo astronauts|last=Chaikin|first=Andrew|date=1994|publisher=Viking|others=Internet Archive|isbn=0-670-81446-6|pages=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apollo 11 Command Module Pilot [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]] has commented that he thought Aldrin "resents not being first on the moon more than he appreciates being second."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Collins|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aldrin, a [[Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)|Presbyterian]], was the first person to hold a religious ceremony on the Moon. After landing on the Moon, he radioed Earth: "I'd like to take this opportunity to ask every person listening in, whoever and wherever they may be, to pause for a moment and contemplate the events of the past few hours, and to give thanks in his or her own way." He took [[Eucharist|communion]] on the surface of the Moon, but he kept it secret because of a lawsuit brought by atheist activist [[Madalyn Murray O'Hair]] over the [[Apollo 8 Genesis reading|reading of Genesis]] on [[Apollo 8]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chaikin|2007|p=204}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aldrin, then a church [[Elder (Christianity)|elder]], used a home communion kit given to him, and recited words used by his pastor at Webster Presbyterian Church, the Rev.

[[File:A11v 1094228.ogv|thumb|left|Video from the [[Apollo 11]] mission]]
Later Aldrin commented on the event: "Perhaps, if I had it to do over again, I would not choose to celebrate communion. Although it was a deeply meaningful experience for me, it was a Christian sacrament, and we had come to the Moon in the name of all mankind – be they Christians, Jews, Muslims, animists, agnostics, or atheists. But at the time I could think of no better way to acknowledge the enormity of the Apollo 11 experience than by giving thanks to God."&lt;ref name="The Guardian" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Aldrin|2009|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mindful of the controversy caused by the Bible readings made by the Apollo 8 crew, the NASA management had warned the Apollo 11 crew against making any explicit religious comments during the flight. However, in the final Apollo 11 TV broadcast during the return journey to Earth, Aldrin quoted from [[Psalm 8]] (verses 3 and 4)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ryan|1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; "I've been reflecting the events of the past several days and a verse from the Psalms comes to mind to me. 'When I consider the heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars which thou hast ordained, what is man that thou art mindful of him?'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-09-19-3188379411_x.htm |title=Aldrin note up for auction |work=USA Today|date=September 19, 2007|last1=Curry|first1=Matt|agency=Associated Press|access-date=August 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Retirement ==
[[File:Buzz Aldrin black and white dress uniform photo portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|Aldrin as Commandant of the Air Force Test Pilot School]]
After leaving NASA in July 1971, Aldrin was assigned as Commandant of the [[U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School]] at [[Edwards Air Force Base]], [[California]]. Aldrin did not have managerial or test pilot experience, which caused him to perform poorly in his new venture. Aldrin was hospitalized for depression with the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chaikin|2007|p=570}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1972, Aldrin retired from active duty, after 21 years of service, and returned to the Air Force in a managerial role but his career was blighted by personal problems. His autobiographies ''Return to Earth,'' published in 1973,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Aldrin|Warga|1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Magnificent Desolation (book)|Magnificent Desolation]],'' published in June 2009,&lt;ref name="Aldrin2009p"&gt;{{harvnb|Aldrin|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; both recount his struggles with [[clinical depression]] and [[alcoholism]] in the years after his NASA career.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

After retiring from NASA, Aldrin continued to advocate for space exploration. In 1985 he joined the [[University of North Dakota]] (UND)'s College of Aerospace Sciences (now the John D. Odegard School of Aerospace Sciences) at the invitation of John D. Odegard, the dean of the college at time. Aldrin helped to develop UND's Space Studies program and brought Dr. David Webb from NASA to serve as the department's first chair.&lt;ref&gt;Rice, Daniel R (1992). The Clifford Years: The University of North Dakota, 1971–1992. p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, he produced a computer strategy game called ''[[Buzz Aldrin's Race Into Space]]'' (1993). To further promote space exploration, and to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the first lunar landing, Aldrin teamed up with [[Snoop Dogg]], [[Quincy Jones]], [[Talib Kweli]], and [[Soulja Boy]] to create the rap single and video, "Rocket Experience", with proceeds from video and song sales to benefit Aldrin's non-profit foundation, [[ShareSpace foundation|ShareSpace]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/arts/music/article2417581.ece "Buzz Aldrin and Snoop Dogg reach for the stars with Rocket Experience"], ''[[The Times]]'', June 25, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

He referred to the [[Phobos monolith]] in a July 22, 2009, interview with [[C-SPAN]]: "We should go boldly where man has not gone before. Fly by the comets, visit asteroids, visit the moon of [[Mars]]. There's a monolith there. A very unusual structure on this potato shaped object that goes around Mars once in seven hours. When people find out about that they're going to say 'Who put that there? Who put that there?' The universe put it there. If you choose, God put it there."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDIXvpjnRws&amp;eurl=http%3A%2F%2F |title=Buzz Aldrin Reveals Existence of Monolith on Mars Moon |publisher=C-SPAN |date=July 22, 2009|via=YouTube|access-date=August 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2016, Aldrin was part of a tourist group visiting the [[Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station]] in [[Antarctica]] when he fell ill and was evacuated, first to [[McMurdo Station]] and from there to [[Christchurch]], New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=McCann |first1=Erin |title=Buzz Aldrin Is Evacuated From the South Pole After Falling Ill |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/01/world/buzz-aldrin-is-evacuated-from-the-south-pole-after-falling-ill.html |accessdate=December 1, 2016 |work=The New York Times |date=December 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At 86 years of age, Aldrin's visit made him the oldest person to ever reach the South Pole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2016/12/06/buzz-aldrin-being-treated-by-a-doctor-named-david-bowie-yes-after-south-pole-evacuation/?hpid=hp_no-name_hp-in-the-news%3Apage%2Fin-the-news |title=Buzz Aldrin being treated by a doctor named David Bowie (yes) after South Pole evacuation |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=December 6, 2016 |accessdate=December 6, 2016 |last=Wang |first=Amy B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Aldrin cycler ===
In 1985, Aldrin proposed a special spacecraft [[trajectory]] now known as the [[Aldrin cycler]].&lt;ref&gt;Aldrin, E. E., "Cyclic Trajectory Concepts," SAIC presentation to the Interplanetary Rapid Transit Study Meeting, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, October 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Byrnes, D.

Aldrin continues to research this concept with engineers from Purdue University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://buzzaldrin.com/space-vision/rocket_science/aldrin-mars-cycler/|title=Aldrin Mars Cycler|publisher=buzzaldrin.com|access-date=August 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bart Sibrel incident ===
On September 9, 2002, Aldrin was lured to a [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]] hotel on the pretext of being interviewed for a Japanese children's television show on the subject of space. When he arrived, [[Moon landing conspiracy theories|Apollo conspiracy]] proponent [[Bart Sibrel]] accosted him with a film crew and demanded he swear on a [[Bible]] that the Moon landings were not faked, insisting that Aldrin and others had lied about walking on the Moon. After a brief confrontation, during which Sibrel kept following Aldrin despite being told to leave him alone, said to Aldrin: "You're the one who said you walked on the moon when you didn't!" and finally called him "a coward and a liar", Aldrin punched Sibrel in the jaw, which was caught on camera by Sibrel's film crew. Aldrin stated that he had struck Sibrel in order to defend himself and his nearby stepdaughter. Witnesses stated that Sibrel had aggressively poked Aldrin with the Bible before being punched. Additional mitigating factors were that Sibrel sustained no visible injury and did not seek medical attention, and that Aldrin had no previous criminal record; the police declined to press charges against Aldrin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ex-astronaut escapes assault charge |publisher=BBC News |date=September 21, 2002 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/2272321.stm |accessdate=January 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aldrin dedicated a chapter to this incident in his autobiography ''Magnificent Desolation''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Aldrin|2009|p=281}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Detached adapter panel sighting ===
[[File:Buzz Aldrin by Gage Skidmore.jpg|upright|thumb|Aldrin at an event in April 2016.|alt=]]
In 2005, while being interviewed for a documentary titled ''First on the Moon: The Untold Story'', Aldrin told an interviewer that they saw an [[unidentified flying object]]. Aldrin told David Morrison, a [[NASA Astrobiology Institute]] senior scientist, the documentary cut the crew's conclusion &lt;!--see my query above--&gt;that they probably saw one of the four detached spacecraft adapter panels. Their [[S-IVB]] upper stage was {{convert|6000|mi}} away, but the four panels had been jettisoned before the S-IVB made its separation maneuver so they would closely follow the Apollo 11 spacecraft until its first mid-course correction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://history.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/A11_MissionOpReport.pdf|title=Apollo 11 Mission Op Report|work=NASA|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Aldrin appeared on ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'' on August 15, 2007, Stern asked him about the supposed UFO sighting. Aldrin confirmed that there was no such sighting of anything deemed extraterrestrial and said they were, and are, "99.9 percent" sure that the object was the detached panel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://astrobiology.nasa.gov/ask-an-astrobiologist/question/?id=1568|title=NASA Ask an Astrobiologist|author=Morrison, David|date=July 26, 2006|work=NASA|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721050308/http://astrobiology.nasa.gov/ask-an-astrobiologist/question/?id=1568|archivedate=July 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ufoevidence.org/cases/case592.htm|title=Astronaut Buzz Aldrin Recounts Apollo 11 UFO Encounter|date=July 18, 1969|publisher=ufoevidence.org|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160131111340/http://www.ufoevidence.org/cases/case592.htm|archivedate=January 31, 2016|deadurl=yes|accessdate=October 25, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with the [[Science Channel]], Aldrin mentioned seeing unidentified objects, but according to Aldrin his words had been taken out of context. He made a request to the Science Channel to clarify to viewers that he did not see alien spacecraft but was refused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morrison|first=David|year=2009|title=UFOs and Aliens in Space|url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/ufos_and_aliens_in_space|journal=Skeptical Inquirer|volume=33|issue=1|pages=30–31|accessdate=October 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism of NASA's 2003 return-to-Moon objectives ===
In December 2003, Aldrin published an opinion piece in ''[[The New York Times]]'' criticizing NASA's objectives.&lt;ref name="Fly Me To L1"&gt;{{cite web |last=Aldrin |first=Buzz |title=Fly Me To L1 |work=The New York Times |date=December 5, 2003 |url=http://buzzaldrin.com/space-vision/rocket_science/l1-gateport |accessdate=November 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it, he voiced concern about NASA's development of a [[Orion (spacecraft)|spacecraft]] "limited to transporting four astronauts at a time with little or no cargo carrying capability" and declared the goal of sending astronauts back to the Moon was "more like reaching for past glory than striving for new triumphs".&lt;ref name="Fly Me To L1" /&gt;

=== Support of a manned mission to Mars ===
In June 2013, Aldrin wrote an opinion piece, published in ''The New York Times'', supporting a [[manned mission to Mars]] and which viewed the Moon "not as a destination but more a point of departure, one that places humankind on a trajectory to homestead Mars and become a two-planet species."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Aldrin |first=Buzz |title=The Call of Mars |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/14/opinion/global/buzz-aldrin-the-call-of-mars.html |date=June 13, 2013 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=June 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2015, Aldrin, in association with the [[Florida Institute of Technology]], presented a "master plan" to NASA for consideration where astronauts, with a "tour of duty of ten years", establish a colony on Mars before the year 2040.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Dunn |first=Marcia |title=Buzz Aldrin joins university, forming 'master plan' for Mars |url=http://apnews.excite.com/article/20150827/us-sci-buzz-aldrin-c7bc5ba293.html |date=August 27, 2015 |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=August 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
