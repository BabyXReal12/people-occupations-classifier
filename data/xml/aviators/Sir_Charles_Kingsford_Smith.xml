'''Sir Charles Edward Kingsford Smith''', [[Military Cross|MC]], [[Air Force Cross (United Kingdom)|AFC]] (9 February 1897 – 8 November 1935), often called by his nickname ''Smithy'', was an early Australian [[aviator]].

In 1928, he made the first trans-[[Pacific ocean|Pacific]] flight from the [[United States]] to [[Australia]]. He also made the first non-stop crossing of the Australian mainland, the first flights between Australia and New Zealand, and the first eastward Pacific crossing from Australia to the United States; and, also, made a flight from Australia to London, setting a new record of 10.5 days.

== Early life ==
Charles Edward Kingsford Smith was born on 9 February 1897 at Riverview Terrace, [[Hamilton, Queensland|Hamilton]] in [[Brisbane]], [[Queensland]], Australia, the son of William Charles Smith and his wife Catherine Mary (née Kingsford, daughter of [[Richard Ash Kingsford]], a Member of the [[Queensland Legislative Assembly]] and mayor in both [[List of mayors and lord mayors of Brisbane|Brisbane]] and [[Cairns Municipal Council|Cairns]] municipal councils). His birth was officially registered and announced in the newspapers under the surname Smith, which his family used at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bdm.qld.gov.au/IndexSearch/queryEntry.m?type=births|title=1897/C9077 birth of Smith, Charles Edward Kingsford|last=|first=|date=|website=Queensland birth index|publisher=Queensland Government|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110312041850/https://www.bdm.qld.gov.au/IndexSearch/queryEntry.m?type=births|archive-date=12 March 2011|dead-url=yes|access-date=25 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article3645451|title=Family Notices|date=13 February 1897|issue=12,196|location=Queensland, Australia|volume=LIII,|page=4|via=National Library of Australia|newspaper=[[The Brisbane Courier]]|accessdate=25 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest use of the surname Kingsford Smith appears to be by his older brother Richard Harold Kingsford Smith, who used the name at least informally from 1901, although he married in [[New South Wales]] under the surname Smith in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article42944512|title=Dramatic Art and Elocution Class.|date=15 January 1901|issue=47|location=Queensland, Australia|volume=10,|page=2|via=National Library of Australia|newspaper=[[Morning Post (Cairns)]]|accessdate=25 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://familyhistory.bdm.nsw.gov.au/lifelink/familyhistory/search/marriages|title=3979/1903 Smith, Richard H K &amp; Johnson, Elsie K St C|last=|first=|date=|website=New South Wales Marriage Index|publisher=[[New South Wales Government]]|access-date=25 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1903, his parents moved to Canada where they adopted the surname Kingsford Smith. They returned to Sydney in 1907.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/kingsford-smith-sir-charles-edward-6964|title=Australian Dictionary of Biography|last=Howard|first=Frederick|publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|location=Canberra|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171104061541/http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/kingsford-smith-sir-charles-edward-6964 |archivedate=4 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kingsford Smith attended school in Vancouver, Canada and then at [[St Andrew's Cathedral School]] and [[Sydney Technical High School]] in Sydney before becoming an engineering apprentice with the [[CSR Limited|Colonial Sugar Refining Company]] at 16.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==World War I and early flying experience==
In 1915, he enlisted for duty in the [[First Australian Imperial Force|1st AIF]] (Australian Army) and served at [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]]. Initially, he performed duty as a motorcycle dispatch rider, before transferring to the [[Royal Flying Corps]], earning his pilot's wings in 1917.

In August 1917, while serving with [[No. 23 Squadron RAF|No. 23 Squadron]], Kingsford Smith was shot down and received injuries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.awm.gov.au/collection/P10676529 |title=Lieutenant Charles Edward Kingsford-Smith |publisher=[[Australian War Memorial]] |accessdate=9 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which required [[amputation]] of two toes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nma.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/19637/Kingsford_Smith_B_and_W.pdf |title=Finding 'Smithy' |page=6|date=2003 |publisher=[[National Museum of Australia]] |accessdate=9 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded the [[Military Cross]] for his gallantry in battle. As his recovery was predicted to be lengthy, Kingsford Smith was permitted to take leave in Australia where he visited his parents. Returning to England, Kingsford Smith was assigned to instructor duties and promoted to [[Captain (OF-2)|Captain]].

On 1 April 1918, along with other members of the Royal Flying Corps, Kingsford Smith was transferred to the newly established [[Royal Air Force]]. On being demobilised in England, in early 1919, he joined Tasmanian Cyril Maddocks, to form Kingsford Smith, Maddocks Aeros Ltd, flying a joy-riding service mainly in the North of England, during the summer of 1919, initially using surplus [[DH.6]] trainers, then surplus [[B.E.2]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Aspin, Chris  ''Dizzy Heights  The Story of Lancashire's First Flying Men'' Helmshore Local History Society 1988 pp125-9 {{ISBN|0-906881-04-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later Kingsford Smith worked as a [[Barnstorming|barnstormer]] in the United States before returning to Australia in 1921.&lt;ref name="fifty"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.awm.gov.au/fiftyaustralians/28.asp |title=Fifty Australians |publisher=Awm.gov.au |date=31 May 1928 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204001924/http://www.awm.gov.au/fiftyaustralians/28.asp |archivedate=4 December 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He did the same in Australia and also flew airmail services, and began to plan his record-breaking flight across the Pacific.&lt;ref name="acepilots"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://acepilots.com/wwi/pio_ksmith.html |title=Charles Kingsford Smith biography Ace Pilots |publisher=Acepilots.com |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927044808/http://acepilots.com/wwi/pio_ksmith.html |archivedate=27 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Applying for a commercial pilot's licence on 2 June 1921 (in which he gave his name as 'Charles Edward Kingsford-Smith'),&lt;ref name="licence"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vrroom.naa.gov.au/print_display.aspx?ObjectType=SingleRecordPrint&amp;irecordid=800|via=National Archives of Australia| title=Application for pilot's licence  – Charles Edward Kingsford-Smith|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090328124509/http://vrroom.naa.gov.au/print_display.aspx?ObjectType=SingleRecordPrint&amp;irecordid=800 |archivedate=28 March 2009|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; he became one of Australia's first airline pilots when he was chosen by [[Norman Brearley]] to fly for the newly formed [[West Australian Airways]].

During the First World War, Ken Richards had been the observer in Kingsford Smith's plane in France. Later Richards moved to [[Cowra, New South Wales]]. Kingsford Smith owned an old Avro plane and in 1922 flew to Cowra to see his old comrade. Kingsford Smith and Richards flew under the Cowra traffic bridge. They also attempted to fly under the nearby railway bridge, but Richards fortunately noticed the telephone lines and pulled the aircraft away only seconds from impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Kingsford Smith flies under the Cowra traffic bridge | publisher =Cowra Tourism Corporation | date =February 2011 | url =http://www.cowratourism.com.au/Experience_Cowra/History/Kingsford_Smith_Flight/ | accessdate =4 February 2011 | deadurl =yes | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20110217155430/http://www.cowratourism.com.au/Experience_Cowra/History/Kingsford_Smith_Flight/ | archivedate =17 February 2011 | df =dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928, Kingsford Smith and [[Charles Ulm]] arrived in the United States and began to search for an aircraft. Famed Australian polar explorer Sir [[Hubert Wilkins]] sold them a [[Fokker F.VII|Fokker F.VII/3m]] monoplane, which they named the ''[[Southern Cross (aircraft)|Southern Cross]]''.&lt;ref name="730r"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2003/s875609.htm |title=7.30 report story about Charles Ulm |publisher=ABCnet.au |date=31 May 1928 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304061014/http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2003/s875609.htm |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At 8:54&amp;nbsp;a.m. on 31 May 1928,&lt;ref name="730r" /&gt; Kingsford Smith and his 4-man crew left [[Oakland, California]], to attempt the first trans-Pacific flight to Australia.

They took off from [[Barking Sands]] on [[Mana]], [[Kauai]], since the runway at Wheeler was not long enough. They headed for [[Suva]], Fiji, {{convert|5077|km|mi}} away, taking 34 hours 30 minutes (91.45&amp;nbsp;mph).

A stamp sheet and stamps, featuring the Australian aviators Kingsford Smith and Ulm, were released by Australia Post in 1978, commemorating the 50th anniversary of the flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=[Australia Post covers]|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/27056372|publication-date=1978|author1=Australia Post.

A young New Zealander named [[Jean Batten]] attended a dinner in Australia featuring Kingsford Smith after the trans-Pacific flight and told him "I'm going to learn to fly." She later convinced him to take her for a flight in the ''Southern Cross'' and went on to become a record-setting aviator, following his example instead of his advice ("Don't attempt to break men's records – and don't fly at night", he told her in 1928 and remembered wryly later).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzedge.com/heroes/batten.html|title=NZEDGE Legends — Jean Batten, Pilot — Endurance|website=www.nzedge.com|accessdate=20 March 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090924011158/http://www.nzedge.com/heroes/batten.html|archivedate=24 September 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1928 Trans-Tasman flight==
After making the first non-stop flight across Australia from [[Point Cook]] near [[Melbourne]] to [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] in Western Australia in August 1928, Kingsford Smith and Ulm registered themselves as Australian National Airways (see below). They then decided to attempt the [[Tasman Sea]] crossing  to New Zealand not only because it had not yet been done, but also in the hope the Australian Government would grant Australian National Airways a subsidised contract to carry scheduled mail regularly.&lt;ref name = "Davis"&gt;[[Pedr Davis|Davis, P.]], 1977, Charles Kingsford Smith: Smithy, the World's Greatest Aviator, Summit Books, {{ISBN|0-7271-0144-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Tasman had remained unflown after the failure of the first attempt in January 1928, when New Zealanders [[Moncrieff and Hood|John Moncrieff and George Hood]] had [[List of aerial disappearances|vanished without trace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/8915725/Lost-in-the-long-white-cloud |title=Lost in the long white cloud |first=Charles |last=Anderson |date=14 July 2013 |work=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |accessdate=8 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kingsford Smith's flight was planned for take off from [[Richmond, New South Wales|Richmond]], near Sydney, on Sunday 2 September 1928, with a scheduled landing around 9:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. on 3 September at [[Wigram Aerodrome]], near [[Christchurch]], the principal city in the [[South Island]] of New Zealand.

The mayor of Christchurch supported the churchmen and cabled a protest to Kingsford Smith. As it happened, unfavourable weather developed over the Tasman and the flight was deferred, so it is not known whether or how Kingsford Smith would have heeded the cable.&lt;ref name="Davis" /&gt;

Accompanied by Ulm, navigator Harold Arthur Litchfield, and radio operator Thomas H. McWilliams, a New Zealander made available by the New Zealand Government, Kingsford Smith left Richmond in the evening of 10 September, planning to fly overnight to a daylight landing after a flight of about 14 hours. The {{convert|2600|km}} planned route was only just over half the distance between Hawaii and Fiji. After a stormy flight, at times through [[Atmospheric icing|icing]] conditions, the ''Southern Cross'' made landfall in much improved weather near [[Cook Strait]], the passage between New Zealand's two main islands. At an estimated {{convert|241|km}} out from New Zealand, the crew dropped a wreath in memory of the two New Zealanders who had disappeared during their attempt to cross the Tasman earlier that year.&lt;ref name="timeline"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/timeline/11/9 |title=Today in History &amp;#124; NZHistory, New Zealand history online |publisher=Nzhistory.net.nz |date=11 September 1928 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126084044/http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/timeline/11/9 |archivedate=26 January 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a tremendous welcome in Christchurch, where the ''Southern Cross'' landed at 0922 after a flight of 14 hours and 25 minutes. About 30,000 people made their way to Wigram, including many students from state schools, who were given the day off, and public servants, who were granted leave until 11&amp;nbsp;a.m.&lt;ref name="timeline"/&gt;  The event was also broadcast live on radio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.natlib.govt.nz/collections/highlighted-items/the-first-flight-across-the-tasman |title=The first flight across the Tasman – National Library of New Zealand |publisher=Natlib.govt.nz |date=11 September 1928 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106001316/http://www.natlib.govt.nz/collections/highlighted-items/the-first-flight-across-the-tasman |archivedate=6 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the [[Royal New Zealand Air Force|New Zealand Air Force]] overhauled the ''Southern Cross'' free of charge Kingsford Smith and Ulm were taken on a triumphant tour of New Zealand, flying in [[Bristol F.2 Fighter|Bristol Fighters]].&lt;ref name="Davis"/&gt;
The return to Sydney was made from [[Blenheim, New Zealand|Blenheim]], a small city at the north of the [[South Island]]. Hampered by fog, severe weather and a minor navigational error, the flight to Richmond took over 23 hours; on touchdown the aircraft had enough fuel for only another 10 minutes flying.&lt;ref name="Davis"/&gt;

=="Coffee Royal" incident==
On 31 March 1929, en route from Sydney to England, the ''Southern Cross'' with Kingsford Smith at the helm made an emergency landing on a mudflat near the mouth of the [[Glenelg River (Western Australia)|Glenelg River]], in the [[Kimberley (Western Australia)|Kimberley]] region of northern Western Australia. The ''Southern Cross'' was found and rescued after a fortnight's searching, with George Innes Beard, Albert Barunga and Wally from the Kunmunya Mission the first overland party to reach the downed aircraft.&lt;ref name=Maisie&gt;{{cite book

While on their way to help with the search two friends of Kingsford Smith crash landed in the [[Tanami Desert]] in Central Australia and died of thirst and exposure on 12 April 1929. The pair, Keith Vincent Anderson and Henry Smith "Bobby" Hitchcock, had been flying a [[Westland Widgeon (fixed wing)|Westland Widgeon]] plane named ''[[Kookaburra (aeroplane)|Kookaburra]]''. Many sections of the media and public felt that the forced landing of the ''Southern Cross'', which was dubbed the "Coffee Royal" incident after the brew of coffee and brandy which the crew had drunk while awaiting rescue, had been a publicity stunt and that Kingsford Smith was responsible for the two deaths. Despite him being exonerated by an official enquiry Kingsford Smith's reputation within Australia never fully recovered during his lifetime.&lt;ref name=terry&gt;{{cite book

The bodies of Anderson and Hitchcock were later recovered from the Tanami Desert. Hitchcock's body was returned to Perth for burial at [[Karrakatta Cemetery]], while Anderson's body was returned to Sydney. Over 6000 mourners attended Keith Anderson's funeral. It was an elaborate affair befitting a national hero. Anderson was buried at Rawson Park, [[Mosman]], on 6 July 1929. A grand memorial was later erected at the gravesite in his honour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Gabrielle |url=http://keithandersonaviator.blogspot.com |title=Keith Anderson WW1 Aviator |publisher=Keithandersonaviator.blogspot.com |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160207112437/http://keithandersonaviator.blogspot.com/ |archivedate=7 February 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After collecting his 'old bus', ''Southern Cross'', from the [[Fokker]] aircraft company in the Netherlands where it had been overhauled, in June 1930 he achieved an east-west crossing of the Atlantic from Ireland to Newfoundland in 31½ hours, having taken off from [[Portmarnock]] Beach (The Velvet Strand), just north of Dublin. New York gave him a tumultuous welcome. The Southern Cross continued on to Oakland, California, completing a circumnavigation of the world, begun in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Shooting Suns and Things: Transatlantic Fliers at Portmarnock |first=Desmond |last=Gallagher |publisher=Kingford Press |year=1986 |isbn=0951156519}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930, he competed in an England to Australia [[air race]], and, flying solo, won the event taking 13 days.

[[File:southern cross minor.jpg|right|thumb|The wreckage of the ''Southern Cross Minor'' displayed at the Queensland Museum.]]
In 1931, he purchased an [[Avro Avian]] he named the ''[[Southern Cross Minor]]'', to attempt an Australia-to-England flight. He later sold the aircraft to Captain [[Bill Lancaster (Aviator)|W.N. "Bill" Lancaster]] who vanished on 11 April 1933 over the [[Sahara Desert]]; Lancaster's remains were not found until 1962. The wreck of the ''Southern Cross Minor'' is now in the [[Queensland Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ctie.monash.edu.au/hargrave/miller.html |title=The Pioneers – Chubbie Miller |publisher=Ctie.monash.edu.au |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608160844/http://www.ctie.monash.edu.au/hargrave/miller.html |archivedate=8 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also in 1931, Smith began developing the [[Southern Cross (automobile)|Southern Cross]] automobile as a side project.

[[File:Charles Kingsford Smith.jpg|thumb|Kingsford Smith in 1933]]
In 1933, [[Seven Mile Beach, New South Wales]], was used by Kingsford Smith as the runway for the first commercial flight between Australia and New Zealand.

In 1934, he purchased a [[Lockheed Altair]], the ''[[Lady Southern Cross]]'', with the intention of competing in the [[MacRobertson Air Race]].&lt;ref name="A Great Pilot Passes"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=|first1=|date=21 November 1935|title=A Great Pilot Passes|journal=[[Flight International|Flight]]|volume=|issue=|page=525|publisher=|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/FlightPDFArchive/1935/1935%20-2-%200579.jpg|accessdate=30 August 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140422231923/http://www.flightglobal.com/FlightPDFArchive/1935/1935%20-2-%200579.jpg|archivedate=22 April 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was unable to make it to England in time for the start of the race, and so flew the ''Lady Southern Cross'' from Australia to the United States instead; the first eastward crossing of the Pacific Ocean by aircraft.

==Disappearance and death==
Kingsford Smith and co-pilot John Thompson "Tommy" Pethybridge were flying the ''Lady Southern Cross'' overnight from [[Allahabad]], India, to [[Singapore]], as part of their attempt to break the England-Australia speed record held by [[C. W. A. Scott]] and [[Tom Campbell Black]], when they [[List of missing aircraft|disappeared]] over the [[Andaman Sea]] in the early hours of 8 November 1935.

Eighteen months later, Burmese fishermen found an undercarriage leg and wheel, with its tyre still inflated, which had been washed ashore at [[Kokunye Kyun|Aye Island]] in the [[Gulf of Martaban]], {{convert|3|km|0|abbr=on}} off the southeast coastline of Burma, some {{convert|137|km|0|abbr=on}} south of [[Mottama]] (formerly known as Martaban).

However, the 2009 search, was in fact, at the same location where the landing gear had been found in 1937, at Aye Island in the [[Andaman Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/kingsford-smith-not-likely-says-dick-smith-20090321-94yj.html |title=Kingsford Smith?

Kingsford Smith was survived by his wife, Mary Kingsford Smith, and their three-year-old son Charles Jnr. Kingsford Smith's autobiography, ''My Flying Life'', was published posthumously in 1937 and became a best-seller.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Howard. ''Australian Dictionary Of Biography – Online Edition. Previously published in Australian Dictionary of Biography. Volume 9, Melbourne University Press, 1983.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Following The Joint Australian Myanmar Lady Southern Cross Search Expedition II (LSCSEII) in 2009, Lay conducted a total of ten further expeditions to Myanmar to recover wreckage from the site. In 2011, Lay claimed to have found the wreckage, but that claim has been widely disputed, and no evidence confirming the claim has been forthcoming. The location of the site, approximately 1.8 miles off the coast of Myanmar, has never been publicly released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/kingsford-smith-not-likely-says-dick-smith-20090321-94yj.html|title=Kingsford Smith?

==A personal memorial==
Australian aviation enthusiast Austin Byrne was part of the large crowd at Sydney's Mascot Aerodrome in June 1928 to welcome the ''Southern Cross'' and its crew following their successful trans-Pacific flight. Witnessing this event inspired Byrne to make a scale model of the ''Southern Cross'' to give to Kingsford Smith. After the aviator's disappearance, Byrne continued to expand and enhance his tribute with paintings, photographs, documents, and artworks he created, designed or commissioned. Between 1930 and his death in 1993, Byrne devoted his life to creating and touring his ''Southern Cross'' Memorial.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nma.gov.au/collections/highlights/austin_byrne_southern_cross_memorial_collection Austin Byrne ''Southern Cross'' Memorial collection highlight: National Museum of Australia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130828041858/http://www.nma.gov.au/collections/highlights/austin_byrne_southern_cross_memorial_collection |date=28 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
