==Career==
His first film appearance was a relatively minor role in the [[cult film]] ''[[The Sandlot]]'' as Phillips, the arch-rival of the title characters.

After several other television and film appearances, most notably the acclaimed [[Emmy Award]]-winning mini-series ''[[Oldest Living Confederate Widow Tells All]]'', he temporarily left acting to finish high school and later to attend [[Columbia University]] in [[New York City]] where he received his degree in [[English language|English]]{{citation needed|date= April 2011}}.
