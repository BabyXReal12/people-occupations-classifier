'''Richard David Bach''' (born June 23, 1936)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.butler-bowdon.com/jonathan-livingston-seagull "Richard Bach (Biographical sketch)."] ''butler-bowdon.com''. Retrieved: December 11, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; is an American writer. Bach is widely known as the author of some of the 1970s biggest-sellers, including ''[[Jonathan Livingston Seagull]]'' (1970) and ''[[Illusions (Bach novel)|Illusions: The Adventures of a Reluctant Messiah]]'' (1977). Bach has written numerous works of fiction, and also non-fiction flight-related titles.

Most of Bach's books have been semi-[[autobiographical]], using actual or [[fiction]]alized events from his life to illustrate his [[philosophy]]. Bach's books espouse his philosophy that our apparent physical limits and mortality are merely appearance. Bach is noted for his love of aviation and for his books related to flying in a [[metaphorical]] context. Bach has pursued flying as a hobby since the age of 17. In late August 2012, Bach was badly injured when on approach to landing at [[Friday Harbor, Washington]], his aircraft clipped some power lines and crashed upside down in a field.

==Early life==
Bach was born in [[Oak Park, Illinois]] to Roland R. Bach, an American Red Cross chapter manager, and Ruth (née Shaw).&lt;ref&gt;Science Fiction and Fantasy Literature, vol. 2, R. Reginald, 1979, pg 803&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[Long Beach State College]] in 1955.

Bach's first airplane flight occurred at age 15, when his mother was campaigning for a seat on the council of [[Long Beach, California]]. Her campaign manager, Paul Marcus, mentioned that he flew airplanes, and invited Richard on a flight in his [[Globe Swift]].&lt;ref&gt;Scott, Phil. "My First Time." ''[[Air &amp; Space/Smithsonian]]'', Vol. 17, No. 2, June/July 2002, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aviation career==
Bach served in the [[United States Navy Reserve]], then in the [[New Jersey Air National Guard]]'s 108th Fighter Wing, [[141st Fighter Squadron]] (USAF), as a [[Republic F-84F Thunderstreak]] fighter [[Aviator|pilot]]. He then worked at a variety of jobs, including as a technical writer for [[Douglas Aircraft]] and as a contributing editor for ''[[Flying (magazine)|Flying]]'' magazine. He served in the USAF reserve and was deployed in France in 1960. He later became a [[Barnstorming|barnstormer]].

During the summer of 1970, Bach and his friend Chris Cagle traveled to Ireland, where they participated in flying sequences for [[Roger Corman]]'s film ''[[Von Richthofen and Brown]]''. They flew a variety of [[World War I]] aircraft of the Blue Max collection owned by ex-[[Royal Canadian Air Force|RCAF]] pilot [[Lynn Garrison]]. Bach and Garrison first met when Bach wrote articles for ''Avian'', Garrison's aviation publication.[[File:Dick Bach take off in Lynn Garrison's Fokker D-V11.png|thumb|During summer 1970 Dick Bach participated in Roger Corman's production, Richthofen &amp; Brown in Ireland]]

Most of Bach's books involve flight in some way, from the early stories which are purely about flying aircraft, to ''Stranger to the Ground'', his first book, to his later works, in which he used flight as a philosophical metaphor.

==Literary career==
In 1970, ''[[Jonathan Livingston Seagull]]'', a story about a seagull who flew for the love of flying rather than merely to catch food, was published by [[Macmillan Publishers]] after the manuscript was turned down by several others. The book, which included photos of seagulls in flight by photographer Russell Munson, became a number-one [[bestseller]]. The book contained fewer than 10,000 words, yet it sold more than 1,000,000 copies in 1972 alone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.isrl.uiuc.edu/~unsworth/courses/bestsellers/search.cgi?title=Jonathan+Livingston+Seagull "Jonathan Livingston Seagull."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060426205845/http://www3.isrl.uiuc.edu/~unsworth/courses/bestsellers/search.cgi?title=Jonathan+Livingston+Seagull |date=2006-04-26 }} ''20th-Century American Bestsellers''. Retrieved: December 11. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The surprise success of the book was widely reported in the media in the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Walters, Raymond, Jr. "Book Review:'Jonathan Livingston Seagull'." ''The New York Times'', July 23, 1972, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Von Richthofen LYNN GARRISON - DICK BACH.jpg|thumb|Richard Bach and Lynn Garrison with [[Helio Courier]] G-ARMU used for ''Von Richthofen and Brown'', 1970]]

In 1973, ''Jonathan Livingston Seagull'' was turned into a [[Jonathan Livingston Seagull (film)|film of the same name]], produced by [[Paramount Pictures Corporation]], with a soundtrack by [[Neil Diamond]]. In 1975, Bach was the driving force behind ''[[Nothing by Chance (film)|Nothing by Chance]]'', a documentary film, based on his book of the same name. The film centers on modern barnstorming around the United States in the 1970s. Bach recruited a group of his friends who were pilots to recreate the era of the barnstormer.&lt;ref&gt;Pendo 1985, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

A second book, ''[[Illusions (Bach novel)|Illusions: The Adventures of a Reluctant Messiah]]'', published in 1977, tells of an encounter with a modern-day messiah who has decided to quit.

On August 31, 2012, Bach was injured in an aircraft landing accident on [[San Juan Island]] in [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. He was landing his aircraft, a 2008 Easton Gilbert G Searey (N346PE) that he nicknamed ''Puff'', at a private airport when the landing gear clipped some power lines. He crashed upside down in a field about two miles from Friday Harbor, taking down two poles and sparking a small grass fire.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/09/01/author-richard-bach-injured-in-washington-plane-crash/?test=latestnews "Author Richard Bach injured in Washington plane crash."] ''[[Fox News]]'', September 1, 2012. Retrieved: December 11, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The day after the accident, Bach was reported to be in serious but stable condition with a head injury and broken shoulder.&lt;ref&gt;Valdes, Manuel. [http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/48871908#.UEJgUSIi4vs "'Jonathan Livingston Seagull' author crashes plane."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120903005042/http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/48871908 |date=2012-09-03 }} ''[[MSNBC]]'' ([[Associated Press]]), September 1, 2012. Retrieved: December 11, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Bach was hospitalized for four months. He reported that his [[near-death experience]] inspired him to finish the fourth part of ''Jonathan Livingston Seagull'', which had been originally published in three parts.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, Jennifer. [http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2020173139_bachjenniferxml.html "Author Richard Bach, recovering from plane crash, returns to inspirational tale."] ''Seattle Times'', January 17, 2013. Retrieved: December 11, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2012, ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' reported that ''Travels with Puff'', the book Bach wrote about crossing the United States in ''Puff'', had been sent to his publisher the day before his accident.&lt;ref&gt;Werris, Wendy. [http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/people/article/55167-despite-crash-new-bach-book-set-for-march.html "Despite crash, new Bach book set for March."] ''Publishers Weekly'', December 14, 2012. Retrieved: December 11, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Travels with Puff'' was released on March 19, 2013.

In 2014, Bach published his long-awaited sequel to ''Illusions: The Adventures of a Reluctant Messiah'', which he called ''[[Illusions II: The Adventures of a Reluctant Student]]''. The story incorporates Bach's real-life aircraft crash, with the author imagining he is being visited by the "messiah" Don Shimoda, who helps him through his difficult medical recovery. Other fictional characters and references also appear.

==Personal life==
Bach had six children with his first wife, Bette Jeanne Franks. Also a pilot, she is the author of ''Patterns: Tales of Flying and of Life'', a book about her life as a pilot and single mother. She typed and edited most of Richard's aviation writing. They divorced in 1970, and Bach spent years without seeing his children.

Richard and Bette's son Jonathan, named after the titular character in Bach's bestseller, ''Jonathan Livingston Seagull,'' is a software engineer and journalist. He wrote the 1993 book ''Above the Clouds,'' about growing up without knowing his father and then later meeting him as a college student. Richard gave his approval, although he noted that it included some personal history he would "rather not see in print."&lt;ref&gt;Bach, Jonathan. ''Above the Clouds: A Reunion of Father and Son.'' New York: William Morrow &amp; Co., 1993. {{ISBN|978-0-6881-1760-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Their other children are Robert, a commercial airline pilot; Kristel; [[James Marcus Bach]], a computer expert and writer; Erika; and their youngest daughter, Bethany, who was killed in an accident at the age of 15 in 1985.

In 1977, Bach married actress [[Leslie Parrish]], whom he met during the making of the film ''Jonathan Livingston Seagull''. She featured significantly in two of his subsequent books: ''The Bridge Across Forever'' and ''[[One: A Novel]]'', which primarily focused on their relationship and Bach's concept of soulmates. They divorced in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Varughese, Suma, [http://www.lifepositive.com/a-long-way-ahead-to-fly/ "A Long Way Ahead to Fly."], Richard Bach interview, ''Life Positive'', March 2006. Retrieved: March 13, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bach married his third wife, Sabryna Nelson-Alexopoulos, in April 1999.
