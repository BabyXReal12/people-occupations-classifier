'''Phillip Calvin McGraw''' (born September 1, 1950),&lt;ref name=tvg&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.tvguide.com/celebrities/phil-mcgraw/bio/233566/ | title= Phil McGraw| publisher= [[TV Guide|TVGuide.com]] |accessdate= April 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; known as '''Dr. Phil''', is an American television personality, author, [[psychologist]], and the host of the television show ''[[Dr. Phil (talk show)|Dr. Phil]]'', which debuted in 2002. McGraw first gained celebrity status with appearances on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' in the late 1990s.&lt;ref name="day"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&amp;res=980DE4DA1131F934A15753C1A9659C8B63| title=Dr. Phil, Medicine Man | last=Day|first= Sherri|work=The New York Times|accessdate=October 23, 2006 | date=October 27, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, ''Forbes'' listed his earnings at $79 million for the previous 12 months, and ranked him the 15th highest earning celebrity in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The World's Highest-Paid Celebrities|url=https://www.forbes.com/celebrities/list/#tab:overall|agency=Forbes|date=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
McGraw was born in [[Vinita, Oklahoma|Vinita]], Oklahoma, the son of Anne Geraldine "Jerry" (née Stevens) and Joseph J. "Joe" McGraw, Jr.&lt;ref name="dembling"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesrecordnews.com/news/2011/jun/19/geraldine-jerrie-mcgraw/|title=Geraldine "Jerrie" McGraw|first=Times Record|last=News|publisher=|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921061242/http://www.timesrecordnews.com/news/2011/jun/19/geraldine-jerrie-mcgraw/|archivedate=September 21, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up with two older sisters, Deana and Donna, and younger sister Brenda&lt;ref name="sisters"&gt;{{cite web | author=|url=http://drphil.com/shows/show/64 | title=Birth Order: Dr. Phil's Sisters Talk |year=2002|publisher=Peteski Productions, Inc.| accessdate=January 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the oilfields of [[North Texas]] where his father was an equipment supplier. During McGraw's childhood, his family moved so his father could pursue a lifelong goal of becoming a [[psychologist]].

McGraw attended [[Shawnee Mission North High School]] in  [[Overland Park, Kansas|Overland Park]], Kansas. In 1968, he was awarded a football scholarship to the [[University of Tulsa]], where he played middle linebacker under Coach [[Glenn Dobbs]]. On November 23 of that year, McGraw's team lost to the [[Houston Cougars football|University of Houston]] 100–6, which is one of the most lopsided games in college football history.&lt;ref name="UT"&gt;{{cite web | author=University of Tulsa|url=http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/tuls/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/2007FBrecords.pdf | title=2007 Golden Hurricane Football Media Guide |publisher=[[University of Tulsa]]| accessdate=January 7, 2008|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coach Dobbs retired after that season and McGraw transferred to [[Midwestern State University]] in [[Wichita Falls, Texas|Wichita Falls]], Texas.

==Education and early career==
McGraw graduated in 1975 from [[Midwestern State University]] with a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in [[psychology]]. He went on to earn an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in [[experimental psychology]] in 1976, and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] degree in [[clinical psychology]] in 1979 at the [[University of North Texas]],&lt;ref name="UNT"&gt;{{cite web | author=|url=http://www.unt.edu/northtexan/archives/s06/alumniawards.htm | title=University of North Texas North Texan Online Summer 2006: Honored Alumni |publisher=[[University of North Texas]]| accessdate=January 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; where his [[dissertation]] was titled "Rheumatoid Arthritis: A Psychological Intervention".&lt;ref&gt;[https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc331903/m1/1/"] "Rheumatoid Arthritis: A Psychological Intervention"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=+%22Rheumatoid+Arthritis%3A+A+Psychological+Intervention.%22&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Search&amp;as_sdt=80001&amp;as_sdtp=on "Rheumatoid Arthritis: A Psychological Intervention"] Scholar.Google.com&lt;/ref&gt; McGraw was guided through the doctoral program by Frank Lawlis, who later became the primary contributing psychologist for the ''Dr. Phil'' television show.&lt;ref name="bestman"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.franklawlis.com/bio.htm |title=Frank Lawlis BIO |accessdate=January 22, 2009 |publisher=Dr. Frank Lawlis |year=2009 |author=Anon |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210121754/http://www.franklawlis.com/bio.htm |archivedate=December 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After obtaining his doctorate, McGraw joined his father, Joe McGraw, in Wichita Falls, Texas, where the elder McGraw had established his private psychology practice.&lt;ref name="newsweek"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/65557|title=Paging Doctor Phil|accessdate=January 13, 2008|publisher=Newsweek|year=2002|author=Marc Peyser}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, McGraw and his father joined Thelma Box, a successful Texas businesswoman, in presenting "Pathways" seminars, "experience-based training which allows individuals to achieve and create their own results."&lt;ref name="Pathways"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gopathways.org/about_pathways.htm |title=About Pathways |accessdate=September 29, 2008 |publisher=Pathways Core Training |year=2007 |author=Pathways Core Training |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704075333/http://www.gopathways.org/about_pathways.htm |archivedate=July 4, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Critics claim that many of the "phrases and the terminology and the quaint sayings" used by McGraw on the ''Oprah'' and ''Dr. Phil'' shows were coined by Box and presented by McGraw in this seminar. McGraw admits that some of the material from ''Life Strategies'', his first best-seller, is taken directly from the Pathways seminar. However, he has never mentioned Box or her contributions to his success in any of his books or TV shows.&lt;ref name="donald"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dallasobserver.com/2000-04-13/news/analyze-this/full|title=Analyze This|accessdate=January 13, 2008|publisher=Dallas Observer|year=2000|author=Mark Donald}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Eight years after joining Box, McGraw signed an agreement for the sale of his Pathways seminar stock for $325,000 without notifying either his father or Box of the impending sale.&lt;ref name="donald" /&gt; Box founded her own seminars entitled "Choices."&lt;ref name="thelmabox"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.choicesseminars.com/About.php |title=About Thelma Box |accessdate=January 13, 2008 |publisher=Choices Seminars |year=2007 |author=Choices Seminars |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207091147/http://choicesseminars.com/About.php |archivedate=February 7, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Texas State Board of Examiners of Psychologists ===
On October 21, 1988, the Texas State Board of Examiners of Psychologists determined that McGraw had hired a former patient for "part-time temporary employment".&lt;ref name="letter2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3496/3743288391_cfa3a1c50b_b.jpg|title=The Texas State Board of Examiners of Psychologists Finding of Facts, page 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, the board cited "a possible failure to provide proper separation between termination of therapy and the initiation of employment,"&lt;ref name="letter1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2469/3744083552_38d45c8043_b.jpg|title=The Texas State Board of Examiners of Psychologists Finding of Facts, page 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; issued a letter of reprimand and imposed administrative penalties.&lt;ref name="letter3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2454/3744080578_26c0e60fae_b.jpg|title=The Texas State Board of Examiners of Psychologists Conclusions of Law, page 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The board also investigated claims made by the patient of inappropriate contact initiated by McGraw, but the "Findings of Fact" document issued by the board on October 21, 1988, at the end of its investigation includes no reference to any physical contact of any kind. It specifically identified "the therapeutic and business relationships" as constituting McGraw's sole issue with the board.&lt;ref name="letter3"/&gt; McGraw fulfilled all terms of the board's requirements, and the board closed its complaint file in June 1990.&lt;ref name="letter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3516/3743291121_f47f5434f6_b.jpg|title=The Texas State Board of Examiners of Psychologists Letter, page 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Courtroom Sciences, Inc===
In 1990, McGraw joined lawyer Gary Dobbs in co-founding Courtroom Sciences, Inc. (CSI), a [[trial consulting]] firm through which McGraw later came into contact with [[Oprah Winfrey]].&lt;ref name="tcpa"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ecpa.cpa.state.tx.us/coa/servlet/cpa.app.coa.CoaGetTp?Pg=tpid&amp;Search_Nm=Courtroom%20Sciences%20&amp;Button=search&amp;Search_ID=17523143273 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213215546/http://ecpa.cpa.state.tx.us/coa/servlet/cpa.app.coa.CoaGetTp?Pg=tpid&amp;Search_Nm=Courtroom%20Sciences%20&amp;Button=search&amp;Search_ID=17523143273 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=February 13, 2008 |title=Franchise Tax Certification of Account Status |accessdate=January 7, 2008 |publisher=Texas Comptroller |year=2008 |author=Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, CSI became a profitable enterprise, advising [[Fortune 500]] companies and injured plaintiffs in achieving settlements. McGraw is no longer an officer or director of the company.&lt;ref name="tcpa" /&gt;

After starting CSI, McGraw ceased the practice of psychology. He kept his license current and in good standing until he elected to retire it 15 years later in 2006.&lt;ref name="license"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3468/3750482552_6024990f7b_b.jpg|title=Dr. Phil's License Status|author=Texas State Board of Examiners of Psychologists}}&lt;/ref&gt; Appearing on the ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today Show]]'' in January 2008, McGraw said that he has made it "very clear" that his current work does not involve the practice of psychology. He also said that he had "retired from psychology".&lt;ref name="msnbc.msn.com"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Considine|first1=Bob|title=Dr. Phil defends intentions with Britney Spears|url=http://www.today.com/id/22901694#.V9nbOdMrKV4|work=Today|date=1 February 2008|quote=In 2002, the California Board of Psychology determined that McGraw did not need his license for the purposes of his show because he was “doing more entertainment than psychology.”}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''Today Show'', the California Board of Psychology determined in 2002 that he did not require a license because his show involves "entertainment" rather than psychology.&lt;ref name="msnbc.msn.com"/&gt;

The TV show ''[[Bull (2016 TV Series)|Bull]]'' is based on his experience as a trial consultant, and he is credited as one of the creators of the series.{{fact|date=June 2018}}

==Television career==
===Oprah Winfrey and the ''Dr. Phil'' show===
In 1995, [[Oprah Winfrey]] hired McGraw's legal consulting firm CSI to prepare her for the [[Food libel laws|Amarillo Texas beef trial]]. Winfrey was so impressed with McGraw that she thanked him for her victory in that case, which ended in 1998. Soon after, she invited him to appear on her show. His appearance proved so successful that he began appearing weekly as a relationship and life strategy expert on Tuesdays starting in April 1998.

The next year, McGraw published his first best-selling book, ''Life Strategies''.&lt;ref name="donald" /&gt; In the next four years, McGraw published three additional best-selling relationship books, along with workbooks to complement them.

As of September 2002, McGraw formed Peteski Productions&lt;ref name="peteski"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kepler.sos.ca.gov/corpdata/ShowAllList?QueryCorpNumber=C2468059|title=Peteski Productions, Inc.|accessdate=January 17, 2008|publisher=State of California|year=2008|author=Secretary of State|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080212091755/http://kepler.sos.ca.gov/corpdata/ShowAllList?QueryCorpNumber=C2468059|archivedate=February 12, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and launched his own [[TV syndication|syndicated]] daily television show, ''[[Dr. Phil (TV series)|Dr. Phil]]'', produced by Winfrey's [[Harpo Productions|Harpo Studios]]. The format is an advice show, where he tackles a different topic on each show, offering advice for his guests' troubles.

===Weight loss products===
In 2003, McGraw entered the weight loss business, selling shakes, energy bars, and supplements. These products were promoted on his show with his sisters Deana and Brenda and nephew Tony among the featured testimonials on the show.&lt;ref name="weightloss"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drphil.com/shows/show/267|title= Weight Loss Challenge: Dr. Phil's Family|accessdate=January 17, 2008|publisher=Peteski Productions, Inc.|year=2004|author=Anon}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These products' labels, which carried the brand name "Shape It Up, Woo, Woo!", stated: "These products contain scientifically researched levels of ingredients that can help you change your behavior to take control of your weight." This met with swift criticism from various sources,&lt;ref name="day" /&gt; accusing McGraw (a clinical psychologist, and not a physician) of lacking the expertise to recommend weight loss products. Facing a [[Federal Trade Commission]] investigation into Shape Up's claims, McGraw pulled his supplements off the market in March 2004, and the FTC dropped its probe. In October 2005, several people who used McGraw's products declared an intent to file a [[class action lawsuit]] against him, claiming that although the supplements cost $120 per month they did not stimulate weight loss.&lt;ref name="ctv"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20051007/drphil_classaction_051007/20051007/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051013055352/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20051007/drphil_classaction_051007/20051007 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=October 13, 2005 |title=Class-action status sought in Dr. Phil diet suit |accessdate=October 21, 2007 |publisher=CTV Globe Media |year=2005 |author=CTV.ca News Staff |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
McGraw settled the suit in September 2006 for $10.5 million.&lt;ref name="usaap"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2006-09-26-dr-phil-diet_x.htm|title=Settlement reached on Dr. Phil diet plan|accessdate=October 21, 2007|publisher=[[USA Today]] – [[Associated Press]]|agency=Associated Press | date=September 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some of the settlement ($6 million) may be paid to the plaintiffs in the form of [[Amway]] ([[Quixtar]]) brand [[Nutrilite]] vitamins.&lt;ref name="mt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metrotimes.com/%5Ceditorial%5Cstory.asp?id=9791 |title=Slimming the Amway |accessdate=October 21, 2007 |publisher=Metro Times |year=2006 |author=Metro Times News Hits staff |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010082818/http://www.metrotimes.com/editorial/story.asp?id=9791 |archivedate=October 10, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''The Making of Dr. Phil'' unauthorized biography (2003) ===
''The Making of Dr. Phil'' is a biography by Sophia Dembling, a reporter from ''[[The Dallas Morning News]]'', and Lisa Gutierrez, a reporter from ''[[The Kansas City Star]]''.&lt;ref name="dembling"&gt;{{cite book |last= Dembling|first= Sophia|title= The Making of Dr. Phil: The Straight-Talking True Story of Everyone's Favorite Therapist|year= 2005|publisher= Wiley|isbn= 0-471-69659-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book probes McGraw's history, with interviews of his childhood friends and former classmates. The book reports that McGraw allegedly used unethical business practices in a gym business early in his career, that he was allegedly abusive to his first wife and to his staff, while noting that he overcame adversity through setting goals and was persistent in achieving success. The book received no promotional help from McGraw or his associates.&lt;ref name="bistro"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediabistro.com/articles/cache/a1938.asp|title=Battling Dr. Phil|accessdate=October 21, 2007|publisher=Media Bistro –  Jupitermedia Corporation|year=2004|author=Sophia Dembling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, McGraw published another best-selling book, ''Family First'', along with a workbook. He also signed a five-year extension of his syndication deal with his show's distributors, [[King World Productions]], Inc.

Also in 2005, McGraw's son Jay's television show ''[[Renovate My Family]]'' (a clone of ABC's ''[[Extreme Makeover: Home Edition]]'') was canceled at the start of its second season following a renovated family's lawsuit.&lt;ref name="renovate_lawsuit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/renovate-my-family/show/28832/story/476.html|title=Renovated family sues|accessdate=January 17, 2008|publisher=Media Life|year=2005|author=Colin Mahan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="renovate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/tracking/viewer.html?tid=15096&amp;ref_id=28832&amp;ref_type=101|title=Wrecker's ball for 'Renovate My Family'|accessdate=January 17, 2008|publisher=Media Life|year=2005|author=CNET Networks Entertainment|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211035445/http://www.tv.com/tracking/viewer.html?tid=15096&amp;ref_id=28832&amp;ref_type=101|archivedate=December 11, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jay McGraw and Phil McGraw then formed [[Stage 29 Productions]].&lt;ref name="stage29"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kepler.sos.ca.gov/corpdata/ShowAllList?QueryCorpNumber=C2786543|title=Stage 29 Media Productions, Inc.|accessdate=January 17, 2008|publisher=State of California|year=2008|author=Secretary of State|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080212091800/http://kepler.sos.ca.gov/corpdata/ShowAllList?QueryCorpNumber=C2786543|archivedate=February 12, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A week later, McGraw and son announced a new show called ''Moochers'' (a clone of ABC's ''Kicked Out'');&lt;ref name="moochers"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2005/scene/markets-festivals/dr-phil-takes-on-moochers-1117934039/|title=Dr. Phil takes on 'Moochers'|accessdate=January 17, 2008|publisher=Variety|author=Josef Adalian | date=December 5, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the show was canceled before any episodes aired. McGraw also released another book, ''Love Smart'', which did not achieve the success of his previous bestsellers.

In 2006, the ''Dr. Phil House'' (a clone of CBS's ''[[Big Brother (TV series)|Big Brother]]'') began airing as part of the ''Dr. Phil'' television show. Following a protest by neighbors, the house in Los Angeles was shut down, and production resumed on a sound stage on a studio back lot.&lt;ref name="house"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tmz.com/2006/10/10/dr-phil-house-shut-down-by-angry-residents/|title="Dr. Phil" House Shut Down By Angry Residents|accessdate=January 17, 2008|publisher=TMZ Productions, Inc.|year=2006|author=TMZ Staff}}&lt;/ref&gt;  McGraw reached the number 22 spot on the [[Forbes Celebrity 100]] list, with income of $45 million.&lt;ref name="forbes2006"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/lists/2006/53/1VDD.html|title=2006 Forbes Celebrity 100|accessdate=February 2, 2008|publisher=Forbes|year=2006|author=Anon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another Stage 29 show, ''[[Decision House]]'' (a remix of the ''Dr. Phil House'') aired from September through November 2007 but was canceled due to poor reviews and dismal ratings.&lt;ref name="decision"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/12/arts/television/12bell.html|title=The Marriage Is in Trouble, So They Take It Onto Television|accessdate=January 17, 2008|publisher=The New York Times|author=Ginia Bellafante | date=September 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ratings for the ''Dr. Phil'' show in 2007 began to slide.

=== Kalpoe lawsuit (2006) ===
McGraw was named a co-defendant, along with [[CBS]] Television, in a 2006 lawsuit filed in relation to the disappearance of [[Natalee Holloway]].&lt;ref name="foxnews"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,236558,00.html|title=Wrongful death, Defamation lawsuits filed in Natalee Halloway case|accessdate=October 21, 2007|publisher=FOX News|author=FOX News | date=December 15, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lawsuit was filed by [[Deepak Kalpoe]] and his brother [[Satish Kalpoe]], who claimed that an interview they did with McGraw, aired in September 2005, was "manipulated and later broadcast as being accurate, and which portrays Deepak Kalpoe and Satish Kalpoe 'as engaging in criminal activity against Natalee Holloway and constitutes defamation.'"&lt;ref name="foxnews" /&gt; The Kalpoe brothers claimed invasion of privacy, fraud, deceit, defamation, emotional distress, and civil conspiracy in the suit, which was filed in the Los Angeles Superior Court.&lt;ref name="hbnews"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Surinamese Brothers Sue Dr. Phil As Halloway Parents Sue Back {{!}} Caribbean360|url = http://www.caribbean360.com/news/surinamese-brothers-sue-dr-phil-as-halloway-parents-sue-back|accessdate = 2015-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="court"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://homepage.mac.com/mcgraw.kalpoe.docs/kalpoe.mcgraw.index.html|title=Pleading Index: Kalpoe v.

===Britney Spears "intervention" (2008)===
In January 2008, McGraw visited pop star [[Britney Spears]] in her hospital room.&lt;ref name="drew"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/10/arts/television/10stan.html|title=Further Adventures in America’s Favorite Pastime, 'Addictionology'|accessdate=January 17, 2008|publisher=NY Times|author=Alessandra Stanley | date=January 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The visit by McGraw drew criticism from the Spears family and from mental health professionals.

The visit appeared to be part of an attempt at getting Spears and her parents to take part in an "intervention" on the ''Dr. Phil'' television show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.showbuzz.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/01/07/people_hot_water/main3681931.shtml|title=Britney In Desert, Dr. Phil Show A No-Go|accessdate=January 12, 2008|publisher=CBS|author=CBS Interactive Inc.|date=January 7, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080110092933/http://www.showbuzz.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/01/07/people_hot_water/main3681931.shtml|archivedate=January 10, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Immediately after the visit, McGraw issued public statements&lt;ref name="et"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etonline.com/news/2008/01/57024/index.html |title=Dr. Phil's Exclusive Statement to ET on Britney |accessdate=January 5, 2008 |publisher=CBS Studios Inc. |year=2008 |author=Anon |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080107003706/http://www.etonline.com/news/2008/01/57024/index.html |archivedate=January 7, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="insider"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theinsideronline.com/news/2008/01/15019/index.html|title=Dr. Phil's Exclusive Statement to 'The Insider' on Britney|accessdate=January 5, 2008|publisher=CBS Studios Inc.|year=2008|author=Anon|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20080301213624/http://www.theinsideronline.com/news/2008/01/15019/index.html|archivedate=March 1, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; about Spears's situation that Spears's family spokeswoman Lou Taylor said violated their family trust in McGraw.

===Polk County, Florida, controversy (2008)===
On April 13, 2008, a producer for the ''Dr. Phil'' show secured $30,000 bail for the ringleader of a group of eight teenage girls who viciously beat another girl and videotaped the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.theweekdaily.com/arts_leisure/people_gossip/39033/did_dr_phil_go_too_far.html | title=Did Dr. Phil go too far? | date=April 14, 2008 | accessdate=April 14, 2008 | publisher=[[The Week]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The teen had been booked at the [[Polk County, Florida]], jail on charges that included kidnapping and assault. Producers of the ''Dr. Phil ''show had made plans to tape a one-hour show devoted to the incident and had sent a production assistant to Orlando to help book guests for the show, but when news broke that the ''Dr. Phil'' show producer had posted bail for the teen, the outcry caused the show to cancel their plans. "In this case certain staffers went beyond our guidelines," said Theresa Corigliano, spokesperson for the ''Dr. Phil'' show. "We have decided not to go forward with the story as our guidelines have been compromised."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsfeedresearcher.com/data/articles_e16/ide2008.04.15.01.35.12.html#hdng0 |title=Dr. Phil Staffers Bail on Show Guidelines |date=April 15, 2008 |accessdate=April 16, 2008 |publisher=NewsFeed Researcher }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}{{Full citation needed|date=August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Riccio lawsuit (2008)===
McGraw was sued by [[Thomas Riccio (auction owner)|Thomas Riccio]], the memorabilia collector responsible for taping the Las Vegas robbery that led to [[O. J. Simpson]]'s being convicted. Riccio sued McGraw in Los Angeles Superior Court for defamation, fraud, intentional infliction of emotional distress and false light for what Riccio claims to have been deceitful editing of the ''Dr. Phil Show'' on which he appeared in early October 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5guIBXhZup6TwEB55A-UYPpumEMxAD93V8NEG0 Simpson trial witness sues Dr. Phil for defamation]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081024133320/http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5guIBXhZup6TwEB55A-UYPpumEMxAD93V8NEG0 |date=October 24, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The claims of defamation, intentional infliction of emotional distress and false light were dismissed, with the judge finding that it was protected speech under the First Amendment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nbclosangeles.com/entertainment/celebrity/Judge-Dismisses-Simpson-Witness-Claim-Against-Dr-Phil.html|title=Judge Backs Dr. Phil in Defamation Lawsuit|work=NBC Southern California|access-date=2017-06-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Approach to psychology ==
[[File:PhilMcGrawHWOFMay2013.jpg|thumb|McGraw in May 2013]]
McGraw's advice and methods have drawn criticism from some fellow psychotherapists as well as from some laymen.

The Foundation also supports charitable organizations that help address the emotional, spiritual, and monetary needs of children and families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dr. Phil Foundation |url=http://drphilfoundation.org/docs/2003-10-22.pdf |format=PDF |title=Dr. Phil McGraw announces the formation of the Dr. Phil Foundation |publisher=Dr. Phil Foundation |accessdate=October 19, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060430192617/http://drphilfoundation.org/docs/2003-10-22.pdf |archivedate=April 30, 2006 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
[[File:PhilRobinMcGrawHWOFMay2013.jpg|thumb|right|McGraw with wife Robin in May 2013]]
McGraw married his first wife, an ex-cheerleader and homecoming queen named Debbie Higgins McCall, in 1970, when he was 20 years old.&lt;ref name="newsweek" /&gt;  According to her, McGraw was domineering and would not allow her to participate in the family business.
