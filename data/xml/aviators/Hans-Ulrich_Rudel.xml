'''Hans-Ulrich Rudel''' (2 July 1916&amp;nbsp;– 18 December 1982) was a German ground-attack pilot during [[World War II]]. Post-war, he was a prominent [[neo-Nazi]] activist in [[Latin America]] and [[West Germany]].

During the war, Rudel was credited with the destruction of 519 tanks, as well as a number of ships. He claimed 651 aerial victories and the destruction of more than 800 vehicles of all types. He flew 2,530 ground-attack missions exclusively on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], usually flying the [[Junkers Ju 87]] "Stuka" [[dive bomber]], and 430 missions flying fighter aircraft. Rudel was the most decorated German serviceman of World War II receiving the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Golden Oak Leaves, Swords, and Diamonds]] in January 1945; the decoration was created specifically for him. Rudel surrendered to US forces on 8 May 1945.

Rudel fled to [[Argentina]] in 1948. A committed and unrepentant [[Nazi]], he founded the "''Kameradenwerk''", a relief organization for [[Nazi war criminals|Nazi criminals]] that helped fugitives escape to [[Latin America]] and the [[Middle East]]. Together with [[Willem Sassen]], Rudel helped shelter [[Josef Mengele]], the notorious former [[SS]] doctor at [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]]. He worked as an arms dealer and a military advisor to the regimes of [[Juan Perón]] in Argentina, of [[Augusto Pinochet]] in Chile, and of [[Alfredo Stroessner]] in Paraguay. Due to these activities, he was placed under observation by the US [[Central Intelligence Agency]].

In the [[West German federal election, 1953|West German federal election of 1953]], Rudel, who had returned to [[West Germany]], was the top candidate for the far-right [[German Reich Party]] but was not elected to the [[Bundestag]]. Following the [[Revolución Libertadora]] in 1955, the uprising that ended the second presidential term of Perón, Rudel moved to Paraguay, where he acted as a foreign representative for several German companies. In 1977, he became a spokesman for the [[German People's Union]], a [[neo-Nazi]] political party founded by the extremist politician [[Gerhard Frey (politician)|Gerhard Frey]]. Rudel died in West Germany in 1982.

==Early life==
Rudel was born on 2 July 1916, in [[Kondratów|Konradswaldau]], in [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]]. He was the third child of Lutheran minister Johannes Rudel.{{sfn|Just|1986|p=9}} As a boy, Rudel was a poor scholar, but a very keen sportsman. Rudel attended the [[humanities]] oriented ''[[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasium]]'', in [[Lubań|Lauban]]. He joined the [[Hitler Youth]] in 1933.{{sfn|Obermaier|1976|p=30}} After graduating with [[Abitur]] in 1936, he participated in the compulsory [[Reich Labour Service]] (RAD).{{sfn|Stockert|1997|p=106}} Following the labour service, Rudel joined the [[Luftwaffe]] in the same year and began his military career as an air reconnaissance pilot.{{sfn|Stockert|1997|p=107}}

==World War II==
[[File:Damaged Marat.jpg|upright|thumb|Aerial photograph of the damaged ''Marat'']]
German forces [[Invasion of Poland|invaded Poland in 1939]] starting [[World War II]] in Europe. As an air observer, Rudel flew on long-range reconnaissance missions over Poland.{{sfn|Obermaier|1976|p=31}} During 1940, he served as a regimental [[adjutant]] for the 43rd Aviators Training Regiment, based at Vienna.{{sfn|Obermaier|1976|p=31}}

In early 1941, he underwent training as a ''[[Stuka]]'' pilot.{{sfn|Obermaier|1976|p=32}} He was posted to a dive-bomber wing, [[Sturzkampfgeschwader 2]] (StG&amp;nbsp;2), which was moved to occupied Poland in preparation for [[Operation Barbarossa]], the invasion of the Soviet Union, in June 1941.{{sfn|Brütting|1992|p=68}} On 21 September 1941, Rudel took part in an attack on the Soviet battleship [[Soviet battleship Marat|''Marat'']] of the [[Baltic Fleet]]. ''Marat''' was sunk at her moorings on 23 September 1941 by hit by one {{convert|1000|kg|adj=on|sp=us}} bomb near the forward superstructure. It caused the explosion of the forward [[magazine (artillery)|magazine]] which demolished the superstructure and the forward part of the hull. 326 men were killed and the ship gradually settled to the bottom in {{convert|11|m|sp=us}} of water.{{sfn|McLaughlin|2003|p=402}} Her sinking is commonly credited to Rudel.{{sfn|Rohwer|2005|p=102}} Rudel's unit then took part in [[Operation Typhoon]], Army Group Center's attempt to capture the Soviet capital.{{sfn|Bergström|2008|p=13}}

Rudel's gunner from October 1941 was Erwin Hentschel, who served with Rudel for the next two and a half years, earning the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross during that period. He completed 1400 sorties with Rudel and drowned on 21 March 1944 when they were making their way to the German lines following a forced landing.&lt;ref&gt;John Ward: [https://books.google.com/books?id=ayoncdaxYkQC&amp;pg=PA217&amp;dq=%22Erwin+Hentschel%22+luftwaffe&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjH-8TIpsLRAhUhrFQKHYICB_IQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Erwin%20Hentschel%22%20luftwaffe&amp;f=false ''Hitler's Stuka Squadrons'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1942, Rudel got married while home on leave.{{sfn|Just|1986|p=22}} Later in the year, he took part in the [[Battle of Stalingrad]].{{sfn|Stockert|1997|p=108}} In February 1943, Rudel flew his 1,000th combat mission.{{sfn|Stockert|1997|p=109}} He then participated in the experiments with using the Ju&amp;nbsp;87&amp;nbsp;G in the [[anti-tank]] role.{{sfn|Just|1986|p=26}} The anti-tank unit took part in operations against the Soviet [[Kerch–Eltigen Operation]]. The footage from an onboard [[gun camera]] was used in ''[[Die Deutsche Wochenschau]]'', a [[Reich Ministry of Propaganda]] newsreel.{{sfn|Just|1986|p=26}} In April 1943, Rudel was awarded the Oak Leaves to the Knight's Cross, receiving them from Hitler personally in Berlin.{{sfn|Stockert|1997|p=109}} Rudel participated in the [[Battle of Kursk]] with the same unit.{{sfn|Stockert|1997|p=110}} In October 1943, Rudel was credited with the destruction of his 100th tank and was awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords]] on 25 November.{{sfn|Just|1986|p=28}}{{sfn|Stockert|1997|p=112}}

Rudel was appointed ''Gruppenkommandeur'' of III. ''Gruppe'' on 22 February 1944.{{sfn|Obermaier|1976|p=35}} On 20 March, Rudel performed a forced landing behind Soviet line and he and his gunner set out to the German lines on foot.  The men attempted to swim across the Dniester River and Rudel's gunner drowned in the attempt.{{sfn|Ward|2004|p=217}} Upon his return, [[Ernst Gadermann]], previously the troop doctor of III. ''Gruppe'', joined Rudel as his new radio operator and air gunner.{{sfn|Brütting|1992|p=93}} Rudel was awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds]] on 29 March 1944, the tenth member of the [[Wehrmacht]] to receive this award. The presentation was made by Hitler personally.{{sfn|Stockert|1997|p=115}} 

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-655-5976-04, Russland, Sturzkampfbomber Junkers Ju 87 G.jpg|thumb|upright|Ju&amp;nbsp;87 equipped with the anti-tank cannon]]
Rudel was promoted to ''Oberstleutnant'' on 1 September 1944, and appointed leader of SG&amp;nbsp;2, replacing Stepp, on 1 October 1944.{{sfn|Obermaier|1976|p=36}} On 22 December 1944, Rudel completed his 2,400th combat mission, and the next day, he reported his 463rd tank destroyed. On 29 December 1944, Rudel was promoted to ''[[Oberst]]'' (colonel), and was awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Golden Oak Leaves, Swords, and Diamonds]], the only person to receive this decoration. This award was presented to him by Hitler on 1 January 1945.{{sfn|Obermaier|1976|p=36}}

On 8 February 1945, Rudel was badly wounded in the right foot, and crash landed inside German lines. Rudel's leg was amputated below the knee.{{sfn|Just|1986|p=34}} He returned to flying on 25 March 1945. He claimed 26 more tanks destroyed by the end of the war.{{sfn|Hamilton|1996|p=425}} On 19 April 1945, the day before Hitler's final birthday, Rudel met with Hitler in the ''[[Führerbunker]]'' at the Reich Chancellery in Berlin.{{sfn|Fraschka|1994|p=132}} On 8 May 1945, Rudel fled westward from an airfield near [[Prague]], landing in US controlled territory, and surrendered.{{sfn|Just|1986|p=35, 43}}{{sfn|Scutts|1999|p=90}}

==Post war==
While Rudel had been interned, his family [[Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944–50)|fled from the advancing Red Army]] and had found refuge with Gadermann's parents in [[Wuppertal]]. Rudel was released in April 1946 and went into private business.{{sfn|Stockert|1997|p=110}} In 1948, he emigrated to [[Argentina]] via the [[Ratlines (World War II aftermath)|ratlines]], travelling via the Austrian [[Zillertal]] to Italy. In [[Rome]], with the help of [[South Tyrol]]ean smugglers, and aided by the Austrian bishop [[Alois Hudal]], he bought himself a fake [[Red Cross]] passport with the cover name "Emilio Meier", and took a flight from Rome to [[Buenos Aires]], where he arrived on 8 June 1948.{{sfn|Goñi|2003|p=287}}{{sfn|Steinacher|2011|loc=chpt. 1.6 "Fake Papers"}}

===In South America===
After Rudel moved to Argentina, he became a close friend and confidant of the [[President of Argentina]] [[Juan Perón]], and Paraguay's dictator [[Alfredo Stroessner]]. In Argentina, he founded the "''Kameradenwerk''" ([[literal translation|lit.]] "comrades work" or "comrades act"), a relief organization for [[Nazi war criminals]]. Prominent members of the "''Kameradenwerk''" included [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] officer Ludwig Lienhardt, whose extradition from Sweden had been demanded by the Soviet Union on war crime charges,{{sfn|Goñi|2003|p=130}} Kurt Christmann, a member of the [[Gestapo]] sentenced to 10 years for war crimes committed at [[Krasnodar]], Austrian war criminal Fridolin Guth, and the German spy in Chile, August Siebrecht. The group maintained close contact with other internationally wanted fascists, such as [[Ante Pavelić]], [[Carlo Scorza]] and [[Konstantin von Neurath]]. In addition to these war criminals that fled to Argentina, the "''Kameradenwerk''" also assisted Nazi criminals imprisoned in Europe, including [[Rudolf Hess]] and [[Karl Dönitz]], with food parcels from Argentina and sometimes by paying their legal fees.{{sfn|Goñi|2003|p=134}} In Argentina, Rudel became acquainted with notorious Nazi concentration camp doctor and war criminal [[Josef Mengele]].{{sfn|Astor|1986|p=170}} Rudel, together with [[Willem Sassen]], a former Waffen-SS and  [[war correspondent]] for the Wehrmacht, who initially worked as Rudel's driver,{{sfn|Benz|2013|p=160}} helped to relocate Mengele to Brazil by introducing him to Nazi supporter Wolfgang Gerhard.{{sfn|Levy|2006|p=273}}{{sfn|Posner|Ware|1986|p=162}} In 1957, Rudel and Mengele together travelled to Chile to meet with [[Walter Rauff]], the inventor of the [[mobile gas chamber]].{{sfn|Goñi|2003|p=290}}

In Argentina, Rudel lived in [[Villa Carlos Paz]], roughly {{convert|36|km|0|sp=us}} from the populous [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba City]], where he rented a house and operated a [[brickworks]].{{sfn|Der Spiegel Volume 51/1950}} There, Rudel wrote his wartime memoirs ''Trotzdem'' ("Nevertheless" or "In Spite of Everything").{{sfn|Just|1986|p=237}} The book was published in November 1949 by the Dürer-Verlag in Buenos Aires. Dürer-Verlag (1947–1958) issued a variety of [[apologia]] by former Nazis and their collaborators. Besides Rudel, among the early editors are [[Wilfred von Oven]], the personal Press adjutant of Goebbels, and Naumann. Sassen convinced [[Adolf Eichmann]] to share his view on the [[Holocaust]]. Together with Eberhard Fritsch, a former [[Hitler Youth]] leader, Sassen began interviewing Eichmann in 1956 with the intent of publishing his views.{{sfn|Benz|2013|p=160}} The Dürer-Verlag went bankrupt in 1958.{{sfn|Benz|2013|p=161}}

Discussion ensued in Germany on Rudel being allowed to publish the book, because he was a known Nazi. In the book, he supported Nazi policies. This book was later re-edited and published in the United States, as the [[Cold War]] intensified, under the title, ''Stuka Pilot'', which supported the German invasion of the Soviet Union. [[Pierre Clostermann]], a French fighter pilot, had befriended Rudel and wrote the foreword to the French edition of his book ''Stuka Pilot''.{{sfn|Just|1986|p=272}} In 1951, he published a pamphlet ''Dolchstoß oder Legende?'' ("Stab in the Back or Legend?"), in which he claimed that "Germany's war against the [[Soviet Union]] was a defensive war", moreover, "a crusade for the whole world".{{sfn|Der Spiegel Volume 52/1982}} In the 1950s, Rudel befriended [[Savitri Devi]], a writer and proponent of [[Hinduism]] and [[Nazism]], and introduced her to a number of Nazi fugitives in Spain and the Middle East.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2002|pp=102–103}}

With the help of Perón, Rudel secured lucrative contracts with the Brazilian military. He was also active as a [[military adviser]] and arms dealer for the Bolivian regime, [[Augusto Pinochet]] in Chile and Stroessner in Paraguay.{{sfn|Goñi|2003|p=288}} He was in contact with [[Werner Naumann]], formerly a [[State Secretary]] in Goebbels' Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda in [[Nazi Germany]]. Following the [[Revolución Libertadora]] in 1955, a military and civilian uprising that ended the second presidential term of Perón, Rudel was forced to leave Argentina and move to Paraguay. During the following years in South America, Rudel frequently acted as a foreign representative for several German companies, including [[Salzgitter AG]], [[Dornier Flugzeugwerke]], [[Focke-Wulf]], [[Messerschmitt]], [[Siemens]] and Lahmeyer International, a German consulting engineering firm.{{sfn|Wulffen|2010|p=139}} Rudel's input was used during the development of the [[A-10 Thunderbolt II]], a [[United States Air Force]] aircraft designed solely for [[close air support]], including attacking ground targets as tanks and [[armoured fighting vehicle|armored vehicles]].{{sfn|Coram|2004|p=235}}

According to the historian Peter Hammerschmidt, based on files of the German [[Federal Intelligence Service (Germany)|Federal Intelligence Service]] and the US [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA), the BND, under the cover-up company "Merex", was in close contact with former [[SS]] and Nazi Party members. In 1966, Merex, represented by Walter Drück, a former ''Generalmajor'' in the Wehrmacht and BND agent, helped by the contacts established by Rudel and Sassen, sold discarded equipment of the ''[[Bundeswehr]]'' (German Federal armed forces) to various dictators in Latin America. According to Hammerschmidt, Rudel assisted in establishing contact between Merex and Friedrich Schwend, a former member of the [[Reich Main Security Office]] and involved in [[Operation Bernhard]]. Schwend, according to Hammerschmidt, had close links with the military services of Peru and Bolivia. In the early sixties, Rudel, Schwend and [[Klaus Barbie]], founded a company called "La Estrella", the star, which employed a number of former SS officers who had fled to Latin America.{{sfn|Hammerschmidt|2014|pp=254–257}}{{sfn|Gessler|2011}} Rudel, through La Estrella, was also in contact with [[Otto Skorzeny]], who had his own network of former SS and Wehrmacht officers.{{sfn|Hammerschmidt|2014|p=257}}

Rudel returned to West Germany in 1953 and became a leading member of the [[Neo-Nazi]] nationalist political party, the [[German Reich Party]] (''Deutsche Reichspartei'' or DRP).{{sfn|Hamilton|1996|p=426}} In the [[West German federal election, 1953|West German federal election of 1953]], Rudel was the top candidate for the DRP, but was not elected to the ''[[Bundestag]]''.{{sfn|Federal Election 1953}} According to [[:de:Josef Müller-Marein|Josef Müller-Marein]], editor-in-chief of ''[[Die Zeit]]'', Rudel had an [[egocentric]] character. In his political speeches, Rudel made generalizing statements, claiming that he was speaking on behalf of most, if not all, former German soldiers of World War II. Rudel heavily criticized the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]] during World War II for not having supported Germany in its war against the Soviet Union. Rudel's political demeanor subsequently alienated him from his former comrades, foremost Gadermann. Müller-Marein concluded his article with the statement: "Rudel no longer has a ''Geschwader''!"{{sfn|Müller-Marein|1953|pp=1–3}} In 1977, he became a spokesman for the [[German People's Union]], a [[nationalist]] political party founded by [[Gerhard Frey (politician)|Gerhard Frey]].{{sfn|Der Tagesspiegel—Visit}}

===Public scandals===
In October 1976, Rudel inadvertently triggered a chain of events, which were later dubbed the [[Rudel Scandal|''Rudel-Affäre'']] (Rudel Scandal). [[Aufklärungsgeschwader 51|''Aufklärungsgeschwader'' 51]] (51st Reconnaissance Wing), the latest unit to hold the name "Immelmann", held a reunion for members of the unit, including those from World War II. The [[Secretary of State]] in the [[Federal Ministry of Defence (Germany)|Federal Ministry of Defence]], [[:de:Hermann Schmidt (Politiker, 1917)|Hermann Schmidt]] authorized the event. Fearing that Rudel would spread Nazi propaganda on the [[German Air Force]] airbase in [[Hartheim am Rhein|Bremgarten]] near [[Freiburg]], Schmidt ordered that the meeting could not be held at the airbase. News of this decision reached ''Generalleutnant'' [[Walter Krupinski]], at the time commanding general of [[NATO]]'s [[Second Allied Tactical Air Force]], and a former World War II fighter pilot. Krupinski contacted [[Gerhard Limberg]], [[Inspector of the Air Force]], requesting that the meeting be allowed to be held at the airbase. Limberg later confirmed Krupinski's request, and the meeting was held on ''Bundeswehr'' premises, a decision to which Schmidt still had not agreed. Rudel attended the meeting, at which he signed his book and gave a few autographs but refrained from making any political statements.{{sfn|Die ZEIT Volume 46/1976}}

During a routine press event, journalists, who had been briefed by Schmidt, questioned Krupinski and his deputy [[Karl Heinz Franke]] about Rudel's presence. In this interview, the generals compared Rudel's past as a Nazi and Neo-Nazi supporter to the career of prominent [[Social Democrat]] leader [[Herbert Wehner]], who had been a member of the [[German Communist Party]] in the 1930s, and who had lived in Moscow during World War II, where he was allegedly involved in [[NKVD]] operations. Calling Wehner an [[extremist]], they described Rudel as an honorable man, who "hadn't stolen the family silver or anything else". When these remarks became public, the Federal Minister of Defense [[Georg Leber]], complying with §50 of the ''{{illm|Soldatengesetz|de|Soldatengesetz}}'' (Military law), ordered the generals into early retirement as of 1 November 1976. Leber,  a member of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD), was heavily criticized for his actions by the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] (CDU) opposition, and the scandal contributed to the minister's subsequent retirement in early 1978.{{sfn|Die ZEIT Volume 46/1976}} On 3 February 1977, the German ''Bundestag'' debated the scandal and its consequences. The Rudel Scandal subsequently triggered a military-tradition discussion, which the Federal Minister of Defense [[Hans Apel]] ended with the introduction of "Guidelines for Understanding and Cultivating Tradition" on 20 September 1982.{{sfn|The Rudel-Scandal}}

During the [[1978 FIFA World Cup]], held in Argentina, Rudel visited the [[German national football team]] in their training camp in [[Ascochinga]]. The German media criticized the [[German Football Association]], and viewed Rudel's visit as being sympathetic to the [[military dictatorship]] that ruled Argentina following the [[1976 Argentine coup d'état]]. During the [[1958 FIFA World Cup]] in Sweden, he visited the German team at [[Malmö]] on 8 June 1958. There he was welcomed by team manager [[Sepp Herberger]].{{sfn|Just|1986|p=270}}

===Personal life, death and funeral===
[[File:Rudelgrabstätte.jpg|thumb|upright|Rudel's grave in Dornhausen]]
Rudel was married three times. His 1942 marriage to Ursula, nicknamed "Hanne", produced two sons, Hans-Ulrich and Siegfried. They divorced in 1950. According to the [[news magazine]] ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', one reason for the divorce was that his wife had sold some of his decorations, including the Oak Leaves with Diamonds, to an American collector, but she also refused to move to Argentina.{{sfn|Der Spiegel Volume 48/1950}} On 27 March 1951, ''Der Spiegel'' published Ursula Rudel's denial of selling his decorations, and further stated she had no intention of doing so.{{sfn|Der Spiegel Volume 13/1951}} Rudel married his second wife, Ursula née Daemisch in 1965. The marriage produced his third son, Christoph, born in 1969.{{sfn|Neitzel, Sönke|2005|p=160}} A year later, Rudel survived a [[stroke]] on 26 April 1970.{{sfn|Just|1986|p=37}} Following his divorce in 1977, he married Ursula née Bassfeld.{{sfn|Neitzel, Sönke|2005|p=160}}

Rudel died after suffering another stroke in [[Rosenheim]] on 18 December 1982,{{sfn|Der Spiegel Volume 52/1982}} and was buried in [[Theilenhofen|Dornhausen]] on 22 December 1982. During Rudel's burial ceremony, two ''Bundeswehr'' [[McDonnell F-4|F-4 Phantoms]] appeared to make a low altitude [[flypast]] over his grave. Although Dornhausen was situated in the middle of a flightpath regularly flown by military aircraft, Bundeswehr officers denied deliberately flying aircraft over the funeral. Four mourners were photographed giving [[Nazi salute]]s at the funeral, and were investigated under [[Strafgesetzbuch section 86a|a law banning the display]] of Nazi symbols. The Federal Minister of Defence [[Manfred Wörner]] declared that the flight of the aircraft had been a normal training exercise.{{sfn|Der Spiegel Volume 1/1983}}

Rudel flew 2,530 combat missions on the Eastern Front of World War II. The majority of these were undertaken while flying the Junkers Ju&amp;nbsp;87, although 430 were flown in ground-attack variants of the [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190]]. He was credited with the destruction of 519 tanks, severely damaging the battleship ''Marat'', as well as sinking a [[cruiser]] (incomplete and heavily damaged [[German cruiser Lützow (1939)|''Petropavlovsk'']]), a [[destroyer]] ([[Leningrad-class destroyer leader]] ''Minsk'') and 70 landing craft. Rudel also claimed to have destroyed more than 800 vehicles of all types, over 150 artillery, anti-tank or anti-aircraft positions, 4 armored trains, as well as numerous bridges and supply lines. Rudel was also credited with 51 aerial victories, 42 of which were fighter aircraft and 7 [[Ilyushin Il-2]]s. He was shot down or forced to land 30 times due to anti-aircraft artillery, was wounded five times and rescued six stranded aircrew from enemy-held territory.{{sfn|Obermaier|1976|p=36}}
