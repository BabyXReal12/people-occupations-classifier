'''Francesco De Pinedo''' (February 16, 1890 &amp;ndash; September 2, 1933)&lt;ref name="vindicator"&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-ok_AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Z1UMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1464,3258275&amp;dq=pinedo&amp;hl=en Anonymous, "De Pinedo Dies in Flames as Ocean Plane Crashes," ''Youngstown Vindicator'', September 2, 1933, Page 1.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="canadianpress"&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=NPRlAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=8IgNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1705,152888&amp;dq=pinedo&amp;hl=en Canadian Press, "Pinedo Burned to Death," ''The Sunday Sun'' (Vancouver, British Columbia), September 2, 1933, Page 1.]&lt;/ref&gt; was a famous Italian [[aviator]]. A ''[[Regia Marina]]'' (Italy's Royal Navy) officer who transferred to the ''[[Regia Aeronautica]]'' (Italy's Royal Air Force), he was an advocate of the [[seaplane]] who is best known for his long-range [[flying boat]] flights in the 1920s that demonstrated the feasibility of global air travel.

==Early life==

Pinedo was born on 16 February 1890 in [[Naples]], [[Italy]], into a patrician family, the son of a lawyer. As a teenager he studied literature and the arts and developed a lifelong passion for music.&lt;ref name="il trasvolatore"&gt;[http://www.aeronautica.difesa.it/archiviovetrine_news/Pagine/FrancescoDePinedoiltrasvolatoreImpossibile.aspx aeronautica.difesa.it ''Il portale dell'Aeronautica Militare'': ''Francesco De Pinedo, il trasvolatore'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="biobackground"&gt;[http://www.italystl.com/pride/page9.htm italystl.com The Lord of Distances: Biographical Background: Francesco de Pinedo]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Early career===

Pinedo entered the [[Italian Naval Academy]] at Leghorn ([[Livorno]]) in 1908 at the age of 18. He graduated in 1911 and was commissioned as an officer in the ''[[Regia Marina]]'' (Italy's Royal Navy). He served aboard [[destroyer]]s during the [[Italo-Turkish War]] of 1911-1912, witnessing Italy's air operations against the [[Ottoman Empire]], the first time that any country had used aircraft in combat. The experience sparked his interest in aviation.&lt;ref name="il trasvolatore"/&gt;&lt;ref name="biobackground"/&gt;

After Italy entered [[World War I]] on the side of the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] in May 1915, de Pinedo again saw action at sea. In 1917, he volunteered for duty in the ''Regia Marina'''s air service. Entering flight school at [[Taranto]] in July 1917, he completed aviation training in only 45 days, and qualified as a pilot in two months. He spent most of the rest of the war flying reconnaissance missions for the ''Regia Marina''.&lt;ref name="il trasvolatore"/&gt;&lt;ref name="biobackground"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150610200651/http://www.aero-mondo.fr/biographies/francesco-de-pinedo aero-mondo.fr ''Le Monde de l'aviation'' De Pinedo Francesco]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war ended in November 1918, Pinedo returned briefly to sea duty, but soon resumed aviation duties. In the immediate postwar years he made milestone flights from Italy to the [[Netherlands]] and in 1921 from [[Brindisi]] to [[Constantinople]] in the Ottoman Empire. On 16 October 1923 he transferred from the ''Regia Marina'' to the ''[[Regia Aeronautica]]'' (Italy's Royal Air Force)&lt;ref name="biobackground"/&gt; which had been founded that year as an independent service. He entered the new service with a rank of ''tenente colonnello'' ([[lieutenant colonel]]) and because of his technical and organizaional skills was given senior positions as its chief staff officer and the vice commandant of one of its air [[Squadron (aviation)|squadrons]] despite being only in his early 30s.&lt;ref name="il trasvolatore"/&gt;&lt;ref name="biobackground"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wild"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=NCebxSBU57kC&amp;pg=PA40&amp;lpg=PA40&amp;dq=Francesco+de+Pinedo&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=vOm95x5pFr&amp;sig=-GrlVHrjYKcE5H1AyDk9hHLEnbc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjq18uRoaPKAhUJzmMKHc1wBGo4ChDoAQhHMAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Francesco%20de%20Pinedo&amp;f=false Marshall, David, and Bruce Harris, ''Wild About Flying! Dreamers, Doers, and Daredevils'', Buffalo, New York: Firefly Books, 2003], {{ISBN|1-55297-849-4}}, p. 40.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Pinedo's cultured background and naturally reserved nature, as well as the orderliness and neatness instilled in him by his naval training, made him atypical of the aviators of his day, who tended to be mavericks and daredevils. He preferred to avoid publicity. Adventurous without being reckless, he became an influential advocate of the [[seaplane]], sharing a belief with many other aviators of his time that [[flying boat]]s were the key to aviation's future because of their ability to land safely on the sea in the case of emergencies during long flights over water. He also believed that seaplanes were more practical than landplanes because of the proximity to water of most cities and towns. With airports not yet common, Pinedo observed, "Civilization is built on water. The world's principal cities are mirrored by seas, rivers, or lakes.  Why not utilize these immense, ready-to-use, natural air strips in place of costly airports?"&lt;ref name="biobackground"/&gt; Pinedo even envisioned a day when people would commute to work each day by piloting their own seaplanes from ponds near their homes to municipal docks in city [[marina]]s, where they would moor their planes near their places of employment, then return to them to fly home for the evening.&lt;ref name="biobackground"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wild"/&gt;

By 1925, Pinedo's advocacy of the seaplane and its capability to make global air travel feasible led to him being regarded as Italy's leading expert on aviation matters, especially after he presented a paper to the [[Royal Aeronautical Society]] in [[London]] and published an article in ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' magazine.&lt;ref name="wild"/&gt;

A promising ''Regia Aeronautica'' career as a high-ranking staff officer beckoned to Pinedo, but this did not appeal to him. After only a year working at a desk he requested a leave of absence in late 1924 in order to return to the cockpit to make long-distance flights that would demonstrate the feasibility of long-distance air travel, highlight the superiority of the seaplane in such travel, and show the world that Italy led the way in the pioneering of long-distance aviation. The [[Italian Fascism|Fascist]] leader of Italy, [[Benito Mussolini]], approved of the idea, allowing Pinedo to make the flights that brought him his greatest fame.&lt;ref name="biobackground"/&gt;

=== 1925 Rome-Australia-Tokyo-Rome flight ===

In 1920, the Italian aviators [[Arturo Ferrarin]] and [[Guido Masiero]] had made a multi-stop, 11,000-mile (18,000-km) flight from Rome to [[Tokyo]] in a pair of [[Ansaldo SVA|Ansaldo SVA-9]] [[Trainer aircraft|trainers]]. They had overcome various difficulties, including crashes that damaged or wrecked their aircraft, and they had been the only two out of 11 pilots that had begun the journey to complete it. They had left their planes behind in [[Japan]] and returned to Italy by ship. Pinedo proposed to explore the idea that a seaplane would have been a better choice for the trip by making a flight from Rome to [[Australia]] and [[Tokyo]] and then back to Rome again, a journey over three times as long as the 1920 trip. For his flight, he chose an  [[SIAI S.16|SIAI S.16''ter'']] flying boat which he named ''Gennariello''.&lt;ref name="milestone"&gt;[http://www.italystl.com/pride/page11.htm italystl.com De Pinedo’s Milestone Flights Australia - Japan - America] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304030755/http://www.italystl.com/pride/page11.htm |date=2016-03-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 April 1925, Pinedo and his mechanic, Ernesto Campanelli, departed Rome aboard ''Gennariello''. They stopped first at [[Brindisi]] in [[Italy]], then at [[Leros]] in [[Greece]]; [[Baghdad]] in [[Iraq]]; [[Bushehr]] and [[Chabar]] in [[Persia]]; [[Karachi]], [[Bombay]], [[Cocanada]], and [[Calcutta]] in [[British India]]; [[Akyab]], [[Rangoon]], [[Tavoy]], and [[Mergui]] in [[Burma]]; [[Phuket]] in [[Siam]]; [[Penang]] in [[British Malaya]]; [[Singapore]]; [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]], [[Surabaya]], [[Sumbawa]], and [[Kupang]] in the [[Netherlands East Indies]], and [[Broome, Western Australia|Broome]], [[Carnarvon, Western Australia|Carnarvon]], [[Perth]], [[Bunbury, Western Australia|Bunbury]], [[Albany, Western Australia|Albany]], [[Israelite Bay, Western Australia|Israelite Bay]], and [[Adelaide]] in Australia before reaching [[Melbourne]], where they arrived on 10 June and spent 36 days.&lt;ref name="milestone"/&gt;&lt;ref name="flight19251001"&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com%2Fpdfarchive%2Fview%2F1925%2F1925%2520-%25200644.html&amp;usg=AFQjCNGcDxbpKBgjBn6FteoTZfVFzYOUBw&amp;sig2=gaw8DyhjS4bvT4SKyE7QOw&amp;bvm=bv.110151844,d.cGc Anonymous, "Italian Flight to Tokyo Accomplished," ''Flight'', October 1, 1925, p. 644.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Flight19251112"&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com%2FFlightPDFArchive%2F1925%2F1925%2520-%25200756.PDF&amp;usg=AFQjCNGAjxLdvh8rMqo4jsBR3rq5aLF8jw&amp;sig2=odTGJ0rWSqY1qNjRuPA6xw Anonymous, "Rome-Tokyo-Rome: Marquis de Pinedo's Grand Air Tour Successfully Concluded," ''Flight'', November 12, 1925, p. 756.]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 July, Pinedo and Campanelli flew on to [[Sydney]], where they spent another three weeks. Resuming their flight on 6 August, they visited [[Brisbane]], [[Rockhampton]], [[Townsville]], [[Innisfail, Queensland|Innisfail]], [[Cooktown, Queensland|Cooktown]], and [[Thursday Island, Queensland|Thursday Island]] in Australia; [[Merauke]], [[Aru Islands|Dobo]], [[Ambon Island|Amboina]], and [[Menado]] in the Netherlands East Indies; [[Cebu]], [[Atimonan]], [[Manila]], and [[Aparri]] in the [[Philippines]]; [[Tamsui]] on [[Formosa]]; [[Shanghai]] in [[China]]; [[Mokpo]] in [[Korea]]; and [[Yamakawa, Fukuoka|Yamakawa]] and [[Kagoshima]] in [[Japan]], before arriving in [[Tokyo]] on 26 September.&lt;ref name="milestone"/&gt;&lt;ref name="flight19251001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Flight19251112"/&gt;

After a three-week stay in Tokyo, Pinedo and Campanelli began their return journey to Rome on October 17, a 15,000-mile (24,000-km) trip that they made in only 22 days – an impressive speed at the time – with stops at Kagoshima in Japan; Shanghai in China; [[Hong Kong]]; [[Haiphong]] and [[Saigon]] in [[French Indochina]]; [[Bangkok]] in Siam; Rangoon in Burma; Calcutta, [[Benares]], [[Delhi]], and Karachi in British India; [[Bandar Abbas]] in Persia; Baghdad in Iraq; [[Alexandretta]] in [[Turkey]]; and [[Taranto]] in Italy before arriving in Rome on 7 November. The entire journey, made without special preparations for support at any of the stops and involving two long flights – of {{convert|600|mi|km}} and {{convert|1200|mi|km}} – across the dry land of the [[Indian Subcontinent]] in a non-[[Amphibious aircraft|amphibious]] flying boat, had proceeded without major incident and had required only one engine change, carried out at Tokyo. Pinedo and Campanelli had carried a [[jib]] sail and boat rudder to allow them to sail their flying boat through unfamiliar harbors in awkward winds, but they never used either the sail or the rudder during their expedition. The aviators had covered about {{convert|35000|mi|km}} in 370 hours of flight time in 80 stages over the course of 202 days, and a 1925 issue of the magazine [[Flight (magazine)|''Flight'']] described their journey as "the most extensive aerial tour on record."&lt;ref name="milestone"/&gt;&lt;ref name="flight19251001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Flight19251112"/&gt;

The ''[[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale]]'' gave Pinedo its highest award, the [[FAI Gold Air Medal]], for the flight, the first time it had awarded the medal.&lt;ref name="il trasvolatore"/&gt; The ''Regia Aeronautica'' promoted Pinedo to ''colonnello'' ([[colonel]]) upon his return from the flight,&lt;ref name="il trasvolatore"/&gt; and Italy's [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy|King Victor Emmanuel III]] made him a ''marchese'' ([[Marquess|marquis]]).&lt;ref name="il trasvolatore"/&gt;

=== 1927 "Four Continents" flight ===
[[File:Francisco de Pinedo - El Gráfico 400.jpg|thumb|Francisco de Pinedo - El Gráfico 1927]]
Mussolini suggested that Pinedo next make a flight to the [[Western Hemisphere]] to inspire pride in people of Italian ancestry who had emigrated to the Americas. This idea developed into the "Four Continents" flight of 1927, intended to demonstrate the ability of a flying boat to fly from Italy to [[Africa]] and across the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to [[Brazil]], followed by several stops in [[South America]] and the [[Caribbean]], a tour of the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], and a [[transatlantic flight]] back to [[Europe]] ultimately ending in [[Rome]].&lt;ref name="milestone"/&gt;

Pinedo, his copilot ''Capitano'' ([[Captain (armed forces)|Captain]]) [[Carlo Del Prete]], and mechanic Vitale Zacchetti embarked on the "Four Continents" flight in the [[Savoia-Marchetti S.55]] [[flying boat]] ''Santa Maria'' under Pinedo's command. Leaving [[Cagliari]], [[Sardinia]], on 13 February 1927, they stopped at [[Villa Cisneros]] in [[Spanish Sahara]] and [[Bolama]] in [[Portuguese Guinea]] before attempting to take off from Bolama on 16 February to cross the Atlantic Ocean to Brazil. Sweltering conditions prevented their plane from becoming airborne until they dumped a large quantity of [[gasoline]], forcing them to fly to the [[Cape Verde Islands]] instead, where cooler conditions prevailed. On 23 February, they finally made their Atlantic crossing, braving a storm and landing on the ocean near [[Fernando de Noronha]], where the [[Brazilian Navy]] [[protected cruiser]] {{Ship|Brazilian cruiser|Almirante Barroso|1896|2}} met them and towed them into port. The next day, after repairs necessitated by a collision with ''Almirante Barroso'', they flew on to the mainland of Brazil, landing at [[Natal, Rio Grande do Norte|Natal]] to begin the South American phase of the flight.&lt;ref name="milestone"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1927/1927%20-%200099.html Anonymous, "Pinedo's Big Flight," ''Flight'', February 27, 1927, p. 87.]&lt;/ref&gt;

After stops at various cities in South America including [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil, [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]], [[Montevideo]], [[Uruguay]], and [[Asunción]], [[Paraguay]], the three Italians began a long leg over the dense jungle of Brazil's [[Mato Grosso]] region on 16 March 1927. At one point, a Brazilian river boat had to tow the ''Santa Maria'' for {{convert|200|mi|km}} along the [[Paraguay River]] in search of a suitable takeoff area after a refueling stop, but on 20 March they completed their crossing of the Mato Grosso and landed at [[Manaós]], Brazil. It was history's first flight over the Mato Grosso.&lt;ref name="milestone"/&gt;

After a stop at [[Georgetown, Guyana|Georgetown]], [[British Guiana]], and a crossing of the Caribbean with stops at [[Pointe-à-Pitre]] in [[Guadeloupe]], [[Port-au-Prince]] in [[Haiti]], and [[Havana]] in [[Cuba]], Pinedo, Del Prete, and Zacchetti crossed the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and arrived at [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], on 29 March 1927, the first time in history that a foreign airplane had flown into the United States.&lt;ref name="milestone"/&gt; They then flew through Louisiana, [[Texas]], [[New Mexico]], and [[Arizona]], intending to reach [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], [[California]], but during a refueling stop on [[Theodore Roosevelt Lake]] in Arizona an accidental fire broke out when a teenage volunteer helping to refuel the ''Santa Maria'' carelessly discarded a cigarette that ignited gasoline on the water's surface. The fire quickly spread to the plane and destroyed it; its engines sank {{convert|60|ft|m}} to the bottom of the lake and were not recovered until 19 April. The three Italians then  flew to San Diego as passengers on a [[United States Navy]] plane and traveled by train to [[New York City]], where they arrived on 25 April 1927 to meet a new S.55 shipped there by the [[Italian Fascist]] government so that they could continue their flight.&lt;ref name="milestone"/&gt;
 
The new plane – identical to the ''Santa Maria'' – arrived in New York  by ship on 1 May 1927, and, after reassembly, was christened ''Santa Maria II'' on 8 May. Following a revised schedule Pinedo drew up that eliminated all stops west of the [[Mississippi River]], Pinedo, Del Prete, and Zacchetti visited [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]; [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]; [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], [[South Carolina]]; [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]], [[Florida]]; and New Orleans before setting out on 14 March 1927 northward up the Mississippi River into the [[Midwestern United States]]. They stopped at [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[Tennessee]], flew over [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], [[Missouri]], and stopped at [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], [[Illinois]]. They then flew into [[Canada]], stopping at [[Montreal]] on 17 March 1927 after an 11-hour flight from Chicago.&lt;ref name="milestone"/&gt;

Pinedo, Del Prete, and Zacchetti flew on to the [[Dominion of Newfoundland]]. On 22 May, they departed [[Trepassey Bay]], planning to cross the Atlantic to the [[Azores]], refuel, and then fly on to [[Portugal]], retracing the transatlantic route of the [[United States Navy]] [[Curtiss NC-4]] flying boat in [[1919 in aviation|1919]], but they ran low on fuel due to unfavorable weather. Pinedo was forced to land the ''Santa Maria II'' on the ocean and be taken under tow by a Portuguese fishing boat and an Italian [[Steamship|steamer]] for the final 200 miles (322&amp;nbsp;km) to the Azores, where the plane arrived at [[Horta, Azores|Horta]] on May 30.&lt;ref name="milestone"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1927/1927%20-%200398.html Anonymous, "Pinedo's Progress," ''Flight'', June 2, 1927, p. 360.]&lt;/ref&gt;

After a week of repairs, the three Italian aviators were airborne again in the ''Santa Maria II'', flying back to the point in the Atlantic where they had been taken under tow, and then finishing their transatlantic flight from there. After stops in Portugal and [[Spain]], Pinedo, Del Prete, and Zacchetti completed the "Four Continents" flight on 16 June 1927, landing ''Santa Maria II'' in [[Ostia (Rome)|Ostia]]'s harbor outside Rome. Their {{convert|29180|mi|km}} flight had taken 124 days.&lt;ref name="milestone"/&gt;&lt;ref name="forgotten"&gt;[http://www.italystl.com/pride/page12.htm italystl.com The Forgotten Hero] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209155940/http://www.italystl.com/pride/page12.htm |date=2012-02-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After returning from the flight, Pinedo was promoted to ''generale di brigata aerea'' ([[brigade general|air brigade general]]),&lt;ref name="il trasvolatore"/&gt; and Mussolini declared him to be the ''Messaggero d’Italianita’'' (Messenger of Italy)&lt;ref name="biobackground"/&gt; and bestowed upon him the sobriquet "Lord of Distances."&lt;ref name="biobackground"/&gt; The [[United Kingdom]] awarded Pinedo its [[Air Force Cross (United Kingdom)|Air Force Cross]] for the "Four Continents" flight and the United States awarded its [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] to him by special act of Congress on May 2, 1928.

=== Mass-formation flights ===
''Regia Aeronautica'' [[General officer|General]] [[Italo Balbo]] relied heavily on Pinedo's advice when planning and executing the mass formation flights &amp;ndash; intended to improve the operational skills of ''Regia Aeronautica'' aircrews and ground crewmen, showcase the Italian aviation industry to potential foreign buyers of Italian-made aircraft, and enhance the prestige of [[Benito Mussolini]]{{'}}s [[Italian Fascist]] government &amp;ndash; for which Balbo became famous. Balbo led the first of these, a six-stage, 1,750-mile (2,818-km) circuit of the [[Western Mediterranean]] by 61 ''Regia Aeronautica'' [[seaplane]]s &amp;ndash; 51 [[Savoia-Marchetti S.59|Savoia-Marchetti S.59''bis'']] and 10 Savoia-Marchetti S.55s &amp;ndash; between May 25 and June 2, 1928. Promoted to ''generale di divisione aerea'' ([[Divisional general|air divisional general]]) and made deputy chief of staff of the ''Regia Aeronautica'', Pinedo joined Balbo in leading the second mass-formation flight, a 3,300-mile (5,314-km) circuit of the [[Eastern Mediterranean]] in June 1929 by 35 ''Regia Aeronautica'' seaplanes &amp;ndash;  32 Savoia-Marchetti S.55s, two Savoia-Marchetti S.59s, and one [[CANT 22]] &amp;ndash; with stops at [[Taranto]], [[Italy]]; [[Athens]], [[Greece]]; [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]]; [[Varna]], [[Bulgaria]]; [[Odessa]] in the [[Soviet Union]]; and [[Constanta]], [[Romania]]. Pinedo and Balbo later had a falling out after Balbo decided that the Italian government would support no more long-distance flights by single aircraft, which Pinedo preferred, and would instead focus its efforts on mass formation flights,  and Pinedo played no role in Balbo's January 1931 mass-formation crossing of the [[South Atlantic Ocean]].&lt;ref name="forgotten"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, Derek, "Italy's Consummate Showman," ''Aviation History'', July 2014, pp. 50-51.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Later career ===

After the "Four Continents" flight, Pinedo increasingly carried out duties in diplomatic and administrative posts that kept him out of the headlines. Balbo's prominence in the Italian Fascist movement meant that Pinedo's break with him led to declining fortunes for Pinedo in his ''Regia Aeronautica'' career.&lt;ref name="forgotten"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pelitti"&gt;[http://www.debeeson.com/debeesonwebnew2015/httpdocs/untoldstory/francisco_de_pinedo.htm Pelitti, Enrico, "A EULOGY OF FRANCESCO DE PINEDO, THE FORGOTTEN HERO"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307032628/http://www.debeeson.com/debeesonwebnew2015/httpdocs/untoldstory/francisco_de_pinedo.htm |date=2016-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his final tour of duty with the ''Regia Aeronautica'', he served as Italy's [[air attaché]] in Argentina, after which he was placed on leave.&lt;ref name="il trasvolatore"/&gt;

Fearing that he would fall into obscurity and wishing to pursue long-distance flights by single aircraft of the type that Balbo would not support, Pinedo resigned from the ''Regia Aeronautica'' in 1933. He traveled to [[New York City]] under the pseudonym "Mr. Smith," purchased a [[AviaBellanca Aircraft|Bellanca]] [[monoplane]], and let it be known that he intended to fly nonstop from New York to [[Baghdad]], [[Iraq]], to set a new world nonstop flight distance record of some {{convert|6300|mi|km}}.&lt;ref name="forgotten"/&gt;

== Death ==

When Pinedo attempted to take off from [[Floyd Bennett Field]] in [[Brooklyn, New York|Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]], on 2 September 1933 for his flight to Baghdad with his Bellanca overloaded with fuel, he lost control of the aircraft. Unable to gain altitude, he veered off the runway and crashed. Thrown from the cockpit, he quickly reached back into it to turn off the smoldering plane's engine, but fuel vapors ignited just as he did and he died in the resulting fire, which also destroyed his plane.&lt;ref name="forgotten"/&gt; The takeoff attempt, crash, and fire all were [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gpB9KLd9Bc  captured on film]. Pinedo's body was burned beyond recognition in the fire.&lt;ref name="vindicator"/&gt;&lt;ref name="canadianpress"/&gt;

At New York, memorial services for Pinedo were held at [[St. Patrick's Cathedral (Manhattan)|St. Patrick's Cathedral]] in [[Manhattan]] while American military planes circled overhead.&lt;ref name="forgotten"/&gt; The Italian ocean liner [[MS Vulcania|MS ''Vulcania'']] transported his remains to Italy.&lt;ref name="il trasvolatore"/&gt;&lt;ref name="forgotten"/&gt; After his coffin reached Rome, a full state funeral with military honors took place.&lt;ref name="pelitti"/&gt;
