'''Per Lindstrand''' (born 8 September  1948) is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[aeronautical engineer]], [[Aviator|pilot]], [[adventurer]] and [[entrepreneur]]. He is particularly known for his series of record-breaking trans-oceanic [[hot air balloon]] flights and, later, attempts to be the first to fly a [[Rozière]] balloon around the Earth – all with [[United Kingdom|British]] [[entrepreneur]], Sir [[Richard Branson]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/703496/Per-Lindstrand Per Lindstrand. (2010). In ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''. Retrieved May 13, 2010, from Encyclopædia Britannica Online]&lt;/ref&gt; He is also the founder of eponymous [[Lindstrand Balloons]] hot air balloon manufacturer based in [[Oswestry]], England.

Lindstrand not only flies balloons, but many other aircraft as well, and holds an airline transport pilot's licence for single and multi-engined land and sea aeroplanes and helicopters, and a commercial pilot's licence for [[Autogyro|autogyros]], [[airships]] and [[Glider (sailplane)|gliders]]. His long standing dream to make a flight around the world in a hot air balloon (as opposed to a [[Rozière]] or [[gas balloon]] which requires no constant source of heated air) still remains unrealized. His distance, duration and altitude records have made him one of the best known balloonists and [[aerostat]] designers and engineers in the world.

==Early life==

Lindstrand's aeronautical career began in the [[Swedish Air Force]] where he was an Engineering Officer. His first balloon flight in the early 1970s was the result of a bet. He built a makeshift balloon and successfully flew it across the runway while in the Swedish Air Force to claim victory. (When he flew more conventional military aircraft, he chose to use call sign, ''Polar Per''.)

Lindstrand later gained a [[masters degree]] in [[aeronautical engineering]] and worked for [[Saab Group|Saab]] Aircraft in [[Sweden]] and [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] in the [[United States]]. He saw his second hot air balloon in 1975 when a neighbour in Sweden purchased it from a British company. When Lindstrand learned that this new balloon was supposed to be ''[[state-of-the-art]]'', he decided that he could do better.

==Company history==
With Swedish aircraft engineer and entrepreneur, [[Håkan Colting]], he formed Colting Balloons which operated in [[Ireland]] from 1976. In 1978 the company moved to [[Oswestry]], [[England]], to be closer to major markets in the [[UK]] and [[Europe]]. When Håkan Colting moved to [[Canada]], Lindstrand continued to run the renamed Colt Balloons (later Thunder &amp; Colt Balloons after acquiring UK-based Thunder Balloons).

In December 1991 Lindstrand founded [[Lindstrand Balloons]] Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lindstrandtech.com/about_us.html Lindstrand Technologies: Per Lindstrand] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100804062900/http://www.lindstrandtech.com/about_us.html |date=2010-08-04 }}, accessed 2010-05-13&lt;/ref&gt; and later created a specialized aerospace company, [[Lindstrand Technologies]] Ltd. (both based in Oswestry) to manufacture and repair [[moored balloon|aerostats]], [[airship]]s, [[gas balloon]]s, passenger-carrying tethered aerostats and other fabric engineering products (including architectural structures, innovative fire-safety devices for road tunnels and inflatable flood defence barriers).  In 2002, Lindstrand Balloons was asked to manufacture the complex parachute for the [[Mars]]-lander, [[Beagle 2]]. Beagle 2 was launched in June 2003 but unfortunately failed to land successfully on the Planet Mars on Christmas Day 2003.

Lindstrand Balloons, in partnership with [[Daimler Chrysler]] Aerospace of [[Germany]], was awarded a design contract by the [[European Space Agency]] to develop a high altitude long endurance airship for possible use in the telecommunications market. Resulting from this, Lindstrand was awarded the German-based ''Korber Prize'' for engineering excellence.

==Record flights==

From early in his business career, Lindstrand's main interest and ambition lay in pushing the boundaries of lighter-than-air technology and he subsequently captured every absolute world record for [[hot air balloon]] flight.

Ascending from [[Plano, Texas|Plano]], [[Texas]], on 6 June 1988, Lindstrand set a new world altitude record for [[hot-air balloon]]s, reaching 19,811 meters (64,997 feet). The record stood until 26 November 2005, when [[Vijaypat Singhania]] exceeded it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4467766.stm Anonymous, "Indian sets balloon flight record," bbc.com, 26 November 2005, 12:11 GMT.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://balloonboise.com/ballooning-history/ balloonboise.com Ballooning History]&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1991, in  the ''Virgin Pacific Flyer'' (a hot air balloon measuring 74,000 m³ (2,600,300&amp;nbsp;ft³), designed and built by Thunder &amp; Colt), Lindstrand and Branson completed the longest flight in [[lighter-than-air]] history when they flew 6761 miles from [[Japan]] to Northern [[Canada]]. Their flight set two new world records for distance and duration and they broke their own ground speed record, recording  245&amp;nbsp;mph (395&amp;nbsp;km/h).  The ''Virgin Pacific Flyer'' still remains the largest hot air balloon ever built.

In an attempt to be the first to fly a balloon of any type around the world, in December 1998, Lindstrand, partnered by Richard Branson and [[Steve Fossett]], flew for 7 days and covered over 20,000&amp;nbsp;km in a [[Rozière]] balloon, launching from [[Morocco]] and landing in the [[Pacific Ocean]] near to rescue services in [[Hawaii]].

Rather less successful was his attempt in 1983 to achieve the world altitude record for hot-air balloons. Sponsored by the English and Welsh Milk Industry, a vast balloon emblazoned with "[[Milk's Gotta Lotta Bottle]]" was prepared for launch to be broadcast on live television early one Saturday morning. Adverse weather conditions led to the mission being aborted, but the balloon filled with air whilst being towed along the ground. Lindstrand was holding one of the ropes, and was lifted 30 feet into the air. On letting go, he fell to the ground, sustaining a dislocated shoulder. The accident, including the fall, was seen and heard on the television broadcast.

==Recognition==

Lindstrand received the [[Royal Aero Club]]'s Gold Medal from [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York|Prince Andrew]] twice, in 1989 and 1991, and the Royal Aero Club’s ''[[Britannia Trophy]]'' in 1988. He is a recipient of America's highest flying award, the [[Harmon Trophy]], given to him by [[Dan Quayle|Vice President Quayle]] in the [[White House]]. In February 2006, he was awarded an Honorary Fellowship by the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] for "his highly innovative work in the field of inflatables and their application to habitable structures". Lindstrand is also in the [[Guinness World Records|Guinness Hall of Fame]].
