[[Air Chief Marshal]] '''Sir Keith Rodney Park''', {{postnominals|country=GBR|size=100%|sep=,|GCB|KBE|MC1|DFC}} (15 June 1892 – 6 February 1975) was a New Zealand soldier, First World War [[flying ace]] and Second World War [[Royal Air Force]] commander. He was in operational command during two of the most significant air battles in the [[European Theatre of World War II|European theatre in the Second World War]], helping to win the [[Battle of Britain]] and the [[Siege of Malta (World War II)|Battle of Malta]]. In Germany, he was supposedly known as "the Defender of London".&lt;ref&gt;Benn, Tony and Lord Tebbit. [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/4284451/United-in-praise-of-The-Defender-of-London.html "United in praise of the Defender of London."] ''The Telegraph,'' 18 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and army career==
Park was born in [[Thames, New Zealand]]. He was the son of [[James Park (geologist)|James Park]] from [[Scotland]], geologist for a mining company and later a professor at the [[University of Otago]] in [[Dunedin]].

An undistinguished young man, but keen on guns and riding, Keith Park was educated at [[King's College, Auckland]] until 1906&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/biographies/5p9/1 "Park, Keith Rodney."] ''Dictionary of New Zealand Biography.'' Retrieved: 8 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and then at [[Otago Boys' High School]], [[Dunedin]] where he served in the cadets. Later he joined the [[New Zealand Army|Army]] as a [[New Zealand Army#Territorial Force|Territorial]] soldier in the [[Royal Regiment of New Zealand Artillery|New Zealand Field Artillery]].&lt;ref name=air&gt;[http://www.rafweb.org/Biographies/Park.htm "Air Chief Marshal Sir Keith Park."] ''Air of Authority – A History of RAF Organisation.'' Retrieved: 8 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1911, at age 19, he went to sea as a [[purser]] aboard collier and passenger steamships, earning the family nickname "skipper".

When the [[First World War]] broke out, Park left the ships and joined his artillery battalion.&lt;ref name=air/&gt; As a non-commissioned officer, he participated in the landings at [[Battle of Gallipoli|Gallipoli]] in April 1915, going ashore at [[Anzac Cove]]. In the [[trench warfare]] that followed, Park's achievements were recognised and in July 1915 he gained a commission as second lieutenant.&lt;ref name=air/&gt; He commanded an artillery battalion during the August 1915 attack on [[Suvla Bay]] and endured more months of squalor in the trenches. At this time Park took the unusual decision to transfer from the [[New Zealand Army]] to the [[British Army]], joining the [[Royal Horse Artillery|Royal Horse and Field Artillery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=29308|date=25 September 1915|page=9514 |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Park was evacuated from Gallipoli in January 1916. The battle had left its mark on him both physically and mentally, though later on in life, he would remember it with nostalgia. He particularly admired the [[Australian and New Zealand Army Corps|ANZAC]] commander, Sir [[William Birdwood]], whose leadership style and attention to detail would be a model for Park in his later career.

After the hardship at Gallipoli, Park's battalion was shipped to France to take part in the [[Battle of the Somme (1916)|Battle of the Somme]]. Here he learned the value of aerial reconnaissance, noting the manner in which German aircraft were able to spot Allied artillery for counter-fire and getting an early taste of flight by being taken aloft to check his battalion's camouflage. On 21 October 1916, Park was blown off his horse by a German shell. Wounded, he was evacuated to England and medically certified "unfit for active service," which technically meant he was unfit to ride a horse. After a brief remission recovering from his wounds, recuperating and doing training duties at [[Royal Arsenal|Woolwich Depot]], he joined the [[Royal Flying Corps]] (RFC) in December 1916.&lt;ref name=air/&gt;

==Flying career==

===First World War===
In the RFC, Park first learned to instruct and then learned to fly. After a spell as an instructor (March 1917 to the end of June), he was posted to France and managed a posting to join [[No. 48 Squadron RAF|48 Squadron]],&lt;ref name=air/&gt; at La Bellevue (near [[Arras]]), on 7 July 1917. Within a week, the squadron moved to Frontier Aerodrome just east of [[Dunkirk]]. Park flew the new [[Bristol F.2 Fighter|Bristol Fighter]] (a two-seat biplane fighter and reconnaissance aircraft) and soon achieved successes against German fighters, earning, on 17 August, the [[Military Cross]] for "conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty", after shooting down an enemy aircraft and causing the destruction of three others&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=30466|date=9 January 1918|page=634 |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Arthur Noss]] as his gunner.&lt;ref&gt;Franks et al. 1997, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; He was promoted to temporary [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]] on 11 September.

After a break from flying, Park returned to France as a [[Major (United Kingdom)|major]] to command 48 Squadron,&lt;ref name=air/&gt; where he showed his ability as a tough but fair commander by demonstrating discipline, leadership and an understanding of the technical aspects of air warfare.

By the end of the war, the strain of command had all but exhausted Park, but he had achieved much as a pilot and commander. He had earned a [[Medal bar|bar]] to his Military Cross,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=30355|date=27 October 1917|page=11108 |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=30583|date=18 March 1918|page=3418 |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]]&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=31378|date=3 June 1919|page=7032 |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the French [[Croix de guerre 1914–1918 (France)|Croix de Guerre]]. His final tally of aircraft claims was five destroyed and 14 (and one shared) "out of control". (His 13th "credit" of 5 September 1917 was Lieutenant Franz Pernet of ''[[Jasta]] [[Oswald Boelcke|Boelcke]]'' (a stepson of General [[Erich Ludendorff]])).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaerodrome.com/forum/people/32657-ludendorffs-son.html "Ludendorff."] ''theaerodrome.com.'' Retrieved: 8 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Park was also shot down twice during this period.

After the [[Armistice with Germany (Compiègne)|Armistice]], he married the London socialite Dorothy "Dol" Parish.

===Inter-war years===
After the War, Park was awarded a permanent commission as a captain in the Royal Air Force and when the new [[RAF officer ranks]] were introduced in 1919, Park became a [[flight lieutenant]].&lt;ref name=air/&gt;  He served as a flight commander on [[No. 25 Squadron RAF|No. 25 Squadron]] from 1919 to 1920 before taking up duties as a squadron commander at the School of Technical Training.&lt;ref name=air/&gt;  In 1922 he was selected to attend the newly formed [[RAF Staff College, Andover|RAF Staff College]].&lt;ref name=air/&gt;  Later on, Park commanded RAF stations and was an instructor before promotion to Air Commodore and an appointment as Senior Air Staff Officer at Fighter Command under [[Air Chief Marshal]] Sir [[Hugh Dowding]] in 1938.&lt;ref name=air/&gt; In 1937 he attended the [[Royal College of Defence Studies|Imperial Defence College]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rafweb.org/Biographies/Park.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second World War===

[[File:Keith Park Replica Hurricane MoTaT2007.jpg|thumb|[[Museum of Transport and Technology|MoTaT]]'s replica of OK1; a [[Hawker Hurricane|Hurricane Mk I]] painted as Park's personal mount during the Battle of Britain]]

====Battle of Britain====
Promoted to the rank of air vice marshal,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=34822|date=2 April 1940|page=1917}}&lt;/ref&gt; Park took command of [[No. 11 Group RAF]], responsible for the fighter defence of London and southeast England, in April 1940.&lt;ref name=air/&gt; He organized fighter patrols over France during the [[Dunkirk, France|Dunkirk]] evacuation and in the [[Battle of Britain]] his command took the brunt of the [[Luftwaffe]]'s air attacks. Flying his personalised [[Hawker Hurricane]] around his fighter airfields during the battle, Park gained a reputation as a shrewd tactician with an astute grasp of strategic issues and as a popular "hands-on" commander. However, he became embroiled in an acrimonious dispute with ambitious Air Vice Marshal [[Trafford Leigh-Mallory]], commander of [[No. 12 Group RAF|12 Group]]. 
Leigh-Mallory, already envious of Park for leading the key 11 Group while No. 12 Group was left to defend airfields, repeatedly failed to support No. 11 Group.  Leigh-Mallory and his [[Big Wing]] (led by [[Douglas Bader]]) often ran amok through No. 11 Group airspace confusing the UK's defences. [[Quintin Brand]]'s No. 10 Group in the South West successfully supported No. 11 Group when required despite having far more arduous defensive duties in its own area than No. 12 Group.

Park's subsequent objection to Leigh-Mallory's behaviour during the Big Wing controversy may have contributed to his and Dowding's removal from command at the end of the battle, but neither Park nor Dowding had much time for internal politics and fell easy prey to their waiting critics. [[Richard Saul]] of 13 Group on the other hand, wrote to Park on learning of his pending departure from No. 11 Group, commenting on "the magnificent achievements of your group in the past six months; they have borne the brunt of the war, and undoubtedly saved England".&lt;ref&gt;Orange, p135 ''Sir Keith Park''&lt;/ref&gt; Park was to remain indignant however over his and Dowding's treatment for the rest of his life. Park was posted immediately to [[RAF Training Command|Training Command]] before seeing later high ranking service in the Mediterranean and elsewhere, while Dowding was sent to America.

Park's [[No. 11 Group RAF]] were coordinated by fighter controllers in the No. 11 Group Operations Room in the underground bunker, now known as the [[Battle of Britain Bunker]] at [[RAF Uxbridge]]. Park himself was not based in the bunker but did visit to impart his wisdom at numerous key points during the battle, along with visits from the Royal Family and [[Winston Churchill]]. Among the many air battles fought over Britain, Park personally commanded RAF forces on several important dates; 13 August ([[Adlertag]]), 18 August ([[The Hardest Day]]) and the 15 September ([[Battle of Britain Day]]).

While overseeing the operations at RAF Uxbridge, Air Vice-Marshal Park stayed in a house opposite the entrance to the bunker. He used a small door to get from the house each day to the bunker. In 1996, the house, named Park House after the war in his honour, was demolished. Only the door and garden wall were retained.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner 2008, pp. 66—67.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Later war career====
[[File:Air Chief Marshal Sir Keith Park, KCB, KBE, MC, DFC (1945) (Art.IWM ART LD 5921).jpg|thumb|''Air Chief Marshal Sir Keith Park, KCB, KBE, MC, DFC'' (1945) by [[Bernard Hailstone]] (Art.IWM ART LD 5921)]]
In January 1942 Park went to [[Egypt]] as Air Officer Commanding,&lt;ref name=air/&gt; where he built up the air defence of the [[Nile Delta]]. In July 1942, following growing concern over the German and Italian attacks on [[Siege of Malta (World War II)#Arrival of Keith Park|Malta]], he returned to action, commanding the vital air defence of the island.&lt;ref name=air/&gt; From there his squadrons participated in the North African and Sicilian campaigns. In January 1944 he was made Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief [[RAF Middle East Command|Middle East Command]].&lt;ref name=air/&gt;

In June 1944, Park was considered by the Australian government to command the [[RAAF]], because of rivalry between the nominal head, Chief of the Air Staff Air Vice Marshal [[George Jones (RAAF officer)|George Jones]] and his deputy the operational head, Air Vice Marshal [[William Bostock]], but General [[Douglas MacArthur]] said it was too late in the war to change. In February 1945 Park was appointed Allied Air Commander, South-East Asia, where he served until the end of the war.&lt;ref name=air/&gt; Park was made a Commander of the [[United States|American]] [[Legion of Merit]] in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=37998 |date=24 June 1947 |page=2940 |supp=y }}&lt;/ref&gt; On leaving the Royal Air Force, Park personally selected a [[Supermarine Spitfire]] to be donated to the [[Auckland War Memorial Museum]], New Zealand. This aircraft is still on display today along with his service decorations and uniform.

==Assessments==
Park retired and was promoted to Air Chief Marshal on 20 December 1946 and returned to New Zealand, where he took up a number of civic roles and was elected to the [[Auckland City Council]] in 1962. He lived in New Zealand until his death on 6 February 1975, aged 82 years.

I do not believe it is realised how much that one man, with his [[leadership]], his calm judgement and his skill, did to save, not only this country, but the world.|[[Arthur William Tedder|Lord Tedder]], Chief of the Air Staff, February 1947.}}

While Sir Hugh Dowding controlled the Battle from day to day, it was Keith Park who controlled it hour by hour. Air Vice Marshal [[Johnnie Johnson (RAF officer)|'Johnnie' Johnson]], one of the top Allied air aces of the war, said: "He was the only man who could have lost the war in a day or even an afternoon".&lt;ref name="sirkeithpark.com"&gt;[http://www.sirkeithpark.com "Introduction by Terry Smith, chairman of the Sir Keith Park Memorial Campaign"] ''sirkeithpark.com.'' Retrieved: 8 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
This was an echo of [[Winston Churchill]]'s description of [[John Jellicoe, 1st Earl Jellicoe|Admiral Jellicoe]] in the [[World War I|First World War]].

Another ace who fought in the Battle of Britain, the RAF pilot [[Douglas Bader]], said that "the awesome responsibility for this country's survival rested squarely on Keith Park's shoulders. British military history of this century has been enriched with the names of great fighting men from New Zealand, of all ranks and in every one of our services. Keith Park's name is carved into history alongside those of his peers."&lt;ref name="sirkeithpark.com"/&gt;

Although Park has not received widespread public recognition, either in Britain or his native New Zealand, he has a claim to be one of the greatest commanders in the history of aerial warfare.

==Recognition==
[[File:Rth Rly SR 34053 Sir Keith Park plate edited-2.jpg|thumb|right|''Sir Keith Park'' commemorative nameplate and RAF shield on a [[Southern Railway (UK)|Southern Railway]] "Battle of Britain" Class locomotive]] 
Keith Park Crescent, a residential road near the former [[RAF Biggin Hill]], is named after Park, as is Keith Park Road within [[RAF Uxbridge]].

A [[Southern Railway (Great Britain)]] [[SR West Country and Battle of Britain Classes|West Country Class/Battle of Britain]] Class locomotive, no. [[SR Battle of Britain class 21C153 Sir Keith Park|21C153 / 34053]] was named after him in 1948. This locomotive carried Park's name and the RAF coat of arms on plates mounted each side of its boiler. The locomotive has survived into preservation, and has been restored from scrapyard condition. The locomotive is owned by [[Southern Locomotives Ltd]] and based on the [[Severn Valley Railway]]. Bewdley Brewery makes a real ale, Sir Keith Park (4.5% ABV), named for the locomotive but indirectly commemorating Park himself.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bewdleybrewery.co.uk/beer/sir-keith-park&lt;/ref&gt;

Park was portrayed by [[Trevor Howard]] in the 1969 film ''[[Battle of Britain (film)|Battle of Britain]]''.

Sir Keith Park is commemorated by the Sir Keith Park Memorial Airfield in Thames, New Zealand; and at the aviation section of the [[Museum of Transport and Technology]], [[Auckland]], New Zealand, the gate guardian of which is a replica of Park's [[Hawker Hurricane]], OK1. The machine is not accurately painted, as it has a stripe around the rear of the fuselage in duck-egg green, which was not introduced until the spring of 1941, by which time he was commanding Training Command.
