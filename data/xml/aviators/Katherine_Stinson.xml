'''Katherine Stinson''' (February 14, 1891 â€“ July 8, 1977) was a pioneering American aviator. She set flying records for distance, endurance, and aerobatic maneuvers, and taught at her family's aviation school.

==Biography==
She was born on February 14, 1891, in [[Fort Payne, Alabama]].

She was the fourth woman in the [[United States]] to obtain a pilot's certificate, which she earned on 24 July 1912, at the age of 21, while residing in [[Pine Bluff, Arkansas]]. Initially, she planned to get her certificate and use money she earned from [[exhibition flying]] to pay for her [[music lessons]]. However, she found she liked flying so much that she gave up her piano career and decided to become an [[aviator]]. In January 1911, Stinson went to St. Louis to take flight lessons from [[Tony Jannus]] who only allowed her to fly as a passenger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Women Who Fly|author1=Lynn M. Homan |author2=Thomas Reilly |author3=Rosalie M. Shepherd }}&lt;/ref&gt; She more than likely received some ground schooling and words of encouragement from [[Wilbur Wright]] himself as she is seen in his company about to refuel an aircraft in early 1912 but Wilbur died in May 1912 and before her flight training was begun or complete. She then took flying lessons from the well-known [[aviator]] [[Max Lillie]], a pilot for the [[Wright Brothers]], who initially refused to teach her because she was female. But she persuaded him to give her a trial lesson. She was so good that she flew alone after only four hours of instruction. A year after receiving her certificate, she began exhibition flying. On the [[exhibition circuit]], she was known as the "Flying Schoolgirl." Katherine Stinson tried to tell newspaper reporters she was actually 21, not 16, but they refused to believe her.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

After she received her certificate, Stinson and her family moved to [[San Antonio, Texas]], an area with an ideal climate for flying. There she and her sister, Marjorie, began giving flying instruction at her family's [[aviation school]] in Texas. In March 1915 the famous [[Lincoln Beachey]] died in a crash at San Francisco and Stinson later acquired the rotary engine from his wrecked plane. On July 18, 1915, Stinson became the first woman to perform a [[aerobatic maneuver|loop]], at [[Cicero Field]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]], and went on to perform this feat some 500 times without a single accident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|magazine=AAHS Journal|date=Winter 2003|title=Katherine Stinson Pioneering Aviatrix|author=Lori Burrup}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also was one of the first women authorized to carry [[airmail]] for the United States. During [[World War I]], Stinson flew a [[Curtiss JN4|Curtiss JN-4D "Jenny"]] and a Curtiss Stinson-Special (a single seat version of the JN aircraft built to her specifications)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|magazine=Air Trails|date=Winter 1971|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; for fundraising tours for the [[American Red Cross]]. During exhibition flights in [[Canada]], Stinson set  Canadian distance and endurance records, and, in 1918, made the second air mail flight in Canada between [[Calgary]] and [[Edmonton]], Alberta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shiels|first=Bob|title=Calgary : a not too solemn look at Calgary's first 100 years|year=1974|publisher=The Calgary Herald|location=Calgary|page=146|url=http://www.ourfutureourpast.ca/loc_hist/page.aspx?id=3597053}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 11, 1917, Katherine Stinson flew 606 miles from [[San Diego]] to [[San Francisco]], setting a new American non-stop distance record.

The Stinson School closed in [[1917 in aviation|1917]], and Katherine became an [[ambulance]] [[driving|driver]] for the Red Cross in [[Europe]].

In 1918, she flew non-stop from Chicago to [[Binghamton, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Travels 783 Miles Without a Stop on Her Way from Chicago to New York.

In [[Europe]] during World War I, she contracted [[influenza]], which damaged her lungs, making her susceptible to [[tuberculosis]]. In 1920, she retired from aviation.

In 1927, she married airman Miguel Antonio Otero, Jr., son of the former territorial governor of [[New Mexico]]. She worked as an [[architect]] for many years in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=PIONEER AVIATRIX NOW IS ARCHITECT|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9D00EFDE173EEE3BBC4C53DFB767838D629EDE|accessdate=October 2, 2015|work=New York Times|agency=Associated Press|subscription=yes|date=November 4, 1936}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She died in [[1977 in aviation|1977]] at the age of 86.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=History Ahead: Stories Beyond the Texas Roadside Markers|author1=Dan K. Utley |author2=Cynthia J. Beeman |page=252}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wedemeyer|first1=Dee|title=Katherine Stinson Otero, 86, Dies|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9901E3DD1F39E334BC4952DFB166838C669EDE|accessdate=October 2, 2015|work=New York Times|subscription=yes|date=July 11, 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Katherine Stinson's biography is featured in CBS TV series ''[[The Henry Ford's Innovation Nation]]'', S3/Ep02 (2016), originally aired October 8, 2016, episode 54 in the series.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thehenryford.org/explore/innovation-nation/episodes#tab=season-3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==

Stinson's flying inspired her brothers to form the [[Stinson Aircraft Company]]. All of her stunt flying was done in aircraft using the Wright control system, which uses two side-mounted levers for pitch and roll, with top mounted controls for throttle and yaw.

*An early [[Emil Matthew Laird|Laird]] biplane looped by Stinson is on display at the [[Henry Ford Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Henry's attic: some fascinating gifts to Henry Ford and his museum|author1=Ford Richardson Bryan |author2=Sarah Evans }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A replica of her 1918 Curtiss Stinson-Special is on display at the [[Alberta Aviation Museum]] in [[Edmonton]].

The second oldest [[general aviation]] [[airport]] in the [[United States]], [[Stinson Municipal Airport]] (KSSF) in San Antonio, Texas, was named in the Stinson family's honor. A middle school in northwest [[San Antonio, TX]], [[Katherine Stinson Middle School]], was named in her honor.

In 2000, Stinson was inducted into the [[International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame]] at the [[San Diego Air &amp; Space Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;Sprekelmeyer, Linda, editor.
