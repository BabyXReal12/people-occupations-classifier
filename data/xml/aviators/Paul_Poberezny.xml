'''Paul Howard Poberezny''' (September 14, 1921&amp;nbsp;â€“ August 22, 2013) was an [[United States|American]] aviator, entrepreneur, and aircraft designer. He founded the [[Experimental Aircraft Association]] (EAA) in [[1953 in aviation|1953]], and spent the greater part of his life promoting [[homebuilt aircraft]].

Poberezny is widely considered as the first person to have universalized the tradition of aircraft homebuilding. Through his work founding EAA and the organization's [[EAA AirVenture Oshkosh|annual convention]], he had the reputation of helping inspire millions of people to get involved in grassroots aviation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flyingmag.com/aircraft/perspectives-homebuilding/how-build-airplane|title= How to Build an Airplane |auothorlink = |last= David Gustafson|year = 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ThreeGreatAccomplisments&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flyingmag.com/aircraft/perspectives-homebuilding/paul-poberezny%E2%80%99s-three-great-accomplishments|title= Paul Poberezny's Three Great Accomplishments |authorlink = |last= David Gustafson|year = 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=51Heroes&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.flyingmag.com/photo-gallery/photos/51-heroes-aviation?image=48|title= 51 Heroes of Aviation |accessdate = 23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Experimental Aircraft Association==
[[File:Paul Poberezny - Red One.jpg|thumb|right|Poberezny driving "Red One" at [[AirVenture]] 2010]]
Poberezny founded the [[Experimental Aircraft Association]] out of his [[Hales Corners, Wisconsin]] home in 1953. It started as predominately a [[homebuilt aircraft|homebuilding]] organization in his basement, but later went on to capture all aspects of [[general aviation]] internationally. Poberezny retired as EAA President in 1989, remaining as Chairman of the organization until 2009. As of 2014, the organization had approximately 180,000 members in more than 100 countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eaa.org eaa.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

EAA's annual convention and fly-in (now known as [[EAA AirVenture Oshkosh]]) in [[Oshkosh, Wisconsin]] attracts a total attendance in excess of 500,000 people, 10,000 aircraft and 1,000 different forums &amp; workshops annually, making it the largest of its kind in the world. It was first held in 1953 at what is now [[Lawrence J. Timmerman Airport|Timmerman Field]] in Milwaukee, and attracted only a handful of airplanes. Towards the late '50s, the event outgrew Timmerman Field and was moved to the [[Rockford, Illinois]] Municipal Airport (now [[Chicago Rockford International Airport]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.eaa.org/en/airventure/about-eaa-airventure-oshkosh/history/the-early-years-of-eaa-fly-in |title= The Early Years |website= Experimental Aircraft Association |accessdate= 2014-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; There, attendance at the fly-in continued to grow until the Rockford airport was too small to accommodate the crowds, and so it was moved to Oshkosh's [[Wittman Regional Airport]] in 1970.

Paul's son, aerobatic world champion [[Tom Poberezny]], was the Chairman of the annual EAA AirVenture Convention from 1977 to August 2011, and was president of EAA from 1989 to September 2010. In March 2009, Paul Poberezny stepped down as Chairman of EAA and his son took on these duties as well.

==Military career==
Poberezny served for 30 years in the [[United States Air Force]], including active duty during [[World War II]] and the [[Korean War]]. He retired with the rank of lieutenant colonel. He attained all seven aviation wings offered by the military: [[Auxiliary Pilot Badge#Glider Pilot|glider pilot]], [[Auxiliary Pilot Badge#Service Pilot|service pilot]], rated pilot, [[Auxiliary Pilot Badge#Liaison Pilot|liaison pilot]], senior pilot, [[United States Aviator Badge#Cold War|Army aviator]] and [[United States Aviator Badge#World War II|command pilot]].

==Aircraft experience==

[[File:Pober Jr Ace.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Pober Jr Ace]]]]
Poberezny flew over 500 aircraft types, including over 170 home-built planes throughout his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|magazine=Air Trails|date=Winter 1971|title=Flying more than 100 different homebuilts|author=Don Berliner}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eaa.org/paul/elder-statesman.asp] EAA, ''Tribute to Paul Poberezny'', accessed 23 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt; He was introduced to aviation in 1936 at the age of 16 with the gift of a donated damaged [[WACO Primary Glider]] that he rebuilt and taught himself to fly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Warbirds of America|author=Jeffrey L. Ethell}}&lt;/ref&gt; A high school teacher owned the glider and offered to pay Poberezny to repair it. He hauled it to his father's garage, borrowed books on building/repairing airplanes, and completed the restoration soon after. A friend used his car to tow the glider into the air with Poberezny at the controls; it rose to around a hundred feet when he released the tow rope and coasted to a gentle landing in a bed of [[alfalfa]].&lt;ref&gt;Scott, Phil, ''My First Time'', [[Air &amp; Space/Smithsonian]], Vol. 17, No. 2 (June/July 2002), p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, Poberezny soloed at age 17 in a 1935 [[Porterfield 35|Porterfield]] and soon co-owned an [[American Eagle A-101|American Eagle biplane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|magazine=Air Progress|date=August 1989|page=40|title=Poberezny Steps Down}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955, Poberezny wrote a series of articles for the publication ''[[Mechanix Illustrated]]'', where he described how an individual could buy a set of plans and build his or her own airplane at home. In the magazine were also photos of himself fabricating the [[Baby Ace]], an amateur-built aircraft (and the first to be marketed as a "homebuilt") that he bought the rights to for US$200 a few years prior. The articles became extremely popular and gave the concept of homebuilding worldwide acclaim.&lt;ref name="ThreeGreatAccomplisments"/&gt;&lt;ref name="51Heroes"/&gt;

He designed, modified and built several home-built aircraft, and had more than 30,000 hours of flight time in his career. Aircraft that he designed and built include:
*[[Acro Sport I]] &amp; [[Acro Sport II|II]]
*[[Howard DGA-3|"Little Audrey"]]
*[[Poberezny P-5 Pober Sport]]
*[[Ace Junior Ace|Pober Jr Ace]]
*[[Pober Pixie]]
*[[Pober Super Ace]]

Poberezny's 1944 [[North American F-51D Mustang]], dubbed ''Paul I'', which he flew at airshows and air races from 1977â€“2003, is on display at the [[EAA Aviation Museum]] in Oshkosh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eaa.org/en/eaa-museum/museum-collection/aircraft-collection-folder/1944-north-american-f-51d-mustang---n3451d|title=1944 North American F-51D Mustang - N3451D|accessdate= 2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1996 Poberezny teamed with his daughter Bonnie, her husband Chuck Parnall, and Bill Blake to write ''Poberezny: The Story Begins'', a recounting of the early years of Paul and Audrey, including the founding of EAA.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Poberezny-Story-Begins-Aviation-History/dp/0965565408/ amazon.com, page for ''Poberezny: The Story Begins''] {{ISBN|0-9655654-0-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Poberezny died of cancer on August 22, 2013 in Oshkosh, Wisconsin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.eaa.org/news/2013/2013-08-22_eaa-founder-paul-poberezny-passes-at-age-91.asp |title=EAA Founder Paul Poberezny Passes at Age 91 |date=22 August 2013 |publisher=EAA |accessdate=22 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130825012232/http://www.eaa.org/news/2013/2013-08-22_eaa-founder-paul-poberezny-passes-at-age-91.asp |archivedate=25 August 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eea.org/news/2013/2013-08-22_eea-founder-paul-poberezny-passes-at-age-91.asp EEA Founder Paul Poberezny Passes at 91]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was survived by his wife, Audrey, and two children: Tom and Bonnie. His estate in Oshkosh is preserved by [[Aircraft Spruce &amp; Specialty Co.]] and was opened to public tours beginning in summer 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.flyingmag.com/poberezny-estate-to-be-preserved?con=TrueAnthem&amp;dom=fb&amp;src=SOC |title=Poberezny Estate to Be Preserved |date=24 January 2017 |publisher=''Flying'' |accessdate=25 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and legacy==
In 1971 Poberezny was the first recipient of the [[Duane Cole|Duane and Judy Cole]] Award, presented to individuals that promote sport aviation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|magazine=Air Progress|date=December 1971|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986 Poberezny was inducted into the Wisconsin Aviation Hall of Fame,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paul Poberezny|url=http://www.aviationhalloffamewisconsin.com/inductees/poberezny_p.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060316131051/http://www.aviationhalloffamewisconsin.com/inductees/poberezny_p.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=16 March 2006|accessdate=17 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1987 the [[National Aeronautic Association]] (NAA) awarded Poberezny the Elder Statesman of Aviation, and in 1999 he was inducted into the [[National Aviation Hall of Fame]] in [[Dayton, Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|magazine=Air Progress|date=December 1987|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received the [[National Business Aviation Association|NBAA]]'s 2001 Award for Meritorious Service to Aviation, and the 2002 [[Wright Brothers Memorial Trophy]]. In 2008 the [[Wisconsin Historical Society]] named him as a "Wisconsin History Maker," recognizing his unique contributions to the state's history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eaa.org/paul/elder-statesman.asp EAA, ''Paul Poberezny: Elder Statesman of Flight'', accessed 23 August 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Flying Magazine]]'' ranked Poberezny at number 4 on their 2013 list of ''The 51 Heroes of Aviation'', putting him ahead of figures like [[Bob Hoover]], [[Amelia Earhart]], [[Jimmy Doolittle]], and even [[Chuck Yeager]].&lt;ref name="51Heroes"/&gt; At the time of its release, just one month before his death, Poberezny was the highest-ranked living person on the list.

In 1997, Poberezny was inducted into the [[International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame]] at the [[San Diego Air &amp; Space Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;Sprekelmeyer, Linda, editor. ''These We Honor: The International Aerospace Hall of Fame''. Donning Co. Publishers, 2006. [[International Standard Book Number|ISBN]] [[Special:BookSources/978-1-57864-397-4|978-1-57864-397-4]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Many prominent aviation figures have praised Poberezny's legacy as being crucial to the maturation of the general aviation industry. Radio newscaster and pilot [[Paul Harvey]] said that Poberezny "militantly manned the ramparts against those who would fence off the sky", and airshow pilot [[Julie Clark]] noted Poberezny as inspiring her and "countless thousands of others to get involved in the promotion of aviation."&lt;ref name="Poberezny Salutes"&gt;{{cite web|title= PAUL H. POBEREZNY: SALUTES|url=http://www.eaa.org/en/eaa/about-eaa/eaa-history/paul-poberezny-eaa-founder/paul-poberezny-salutes|accessdate= 25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two brothers behind the founding of [[Cirrus Aircraft]] have also credited Poberezny and the EAA as essential to their success:

{{quote|"The EAA has [been] the driving force for preserving and fostering the enthusiasm of aviation. Without the enthusiasm and passion for this industry, we would not have seen the great development of GA through the 60s and 70s and, I believe, GA may not have even survived the late 80s and 90s. Paul created an organization that allowed, fostered and promoted creativity and perseverance for aviation. EAA allowed [Alan and me] to dream of something different, and then showed us a path forward for that dream."''|[[Klapmeier brothers|Dale Klapmeier]] &lt;ref name="Poberezny Salutes"/&gt;}}
