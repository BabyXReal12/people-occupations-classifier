'''Sir Thomas Octave Murdoch Sopwith''', [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]], Hon [[FRAeS]] (18 January 1888&amp;nbsp;– 27 January 1989) was an English aviation pioneer, business executive and [[yachtsman]].

==Early life==
Sopwith was born in [[Kensington]], London on 18 January 1888. He was the eighth child and only son of Thomas Sopwith (a civil engineer and managing director of the Spanish Lead Mines Company, [[Linares, Jaén]], Spain) and his wife Lydia Gertrude née Messiter.&lt;ref name="odnb"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| encyclopedia= [[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]] | url = http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/40056 | title =Sir Thomas Octave Murdoch Sopwith | accessdate = 6 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a grandson of mining engineer [[Thomas Sopwith (geologist)|Thomas Sopwith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| encyclopedia= [[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]] | url = http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/26033 | title =Thomas Sopwith (1803-1879) | accessdate = 9 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at [[Cottesmore School]] in [[Hove, England|Hove]] and at Seafield Park engineering college in [[Hill Head]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The Encyclopædia Britannica |volume=20 |year=1929}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When he was ten years old, on 30 July 1898 whilst on a family holiday on the [[Isle of Lismore]], near [[Oban]] in Scotland, a gun lying across young Thomas's knee went off, killing his father. This accident haunted Sopwith for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name="odnb" /&gt;

Sopwith was interested in motor cycles, and took part in the 100-mile Tricar trial in 1904 where he was one of four medal winners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | series = Reminiscences of Motor Cycling | title = Ixion | publisher = EP | url = http://www.goodkarmaproductions.com/HTML/PDF/IXION.pdf | format = [[Portable document format|PDF]] | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140508061936/http://www.goodkarmaproductions.com/HTML/PDF/IXION.pdf | archivedate = 8 May 2014 | df = dmy-all }}.&lt;/ref&gt; He also tried [[hot air ballooning]], his first ascent being in [[Charles Rolls|C.S. Rolls']] balloon in June 1906.&lt;ref name="BMA"&gt;{{Citation | title = The Birth of Military Aviation | first = Hugh | last = Driver | publisher = Royal Historical Society | year = 1997 | ISBN = 978-0-86193-234-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Together with Phil Paddon he bought his own hot air balloon from [[Short Brothers]].&lt;ref name = "BMA" /&gt; For a while he was in business with Phil Paddon selling automobiles as Paddon &amp; Sopwith, [[Albemarle Street]], [[Piccadilly]], London.&lt;ref name="BMA" /&gt;

In his youth, he was an expert [[Ice skating|ice skater]] and played in [[Goaltender|goal]] during [[Princes Ice Hockey Club]]'s 1908 match with C. P. P. Paris and during the 1909–10 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = European Hockey | url = http://www.eurohockey.net/players/show_player.cgi?serial=98083 | title = Thomas Sopwith&amp;nbsp;– player profile and career stats | accessdate = 29 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a member of the [[Great Britain national ice hockey team]] that won the gold medal at the first [[World Ice Hockey Championships|European Championships]] in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Ice Hockey Journalists |place=UK |url=http://www.ihjuk.co.uk/british_rosters/1910.htm |title=Great Britain Roster 1910 |accessdate=29 November 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513015834/http://www.ihjuk.co.uk/british_rosters/1910.htm |archivedate=13 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career in aviation==
[[File:Sopwith 2162905123 40ff396481 o.jpg|thumb|Sopwith in 1911.]]
[[File:Tom Sopwith (LOC).jpg|thumb|Sopwith in 1911.]]
[[File:Sopwith's grave at Lower Somborne.jpg|thumb|Sopwith's grave at [[Little Somborne]].]]
Sopwith became interested in flying after seeing [[John Moisant]] flying the first cross-[[English Channel|Channel]] passenger flight. His first flight was with [[Gustave Blondeau]] in a [[Henry Farman|Farman]] at [[Brooklands]]. He soon taught himself to fly on a [[Howard Wright Avis]] monoplane and took to the air on his own for the first time on 22 October 1910.  He crashed after travelling about 300 yards (275 m), but soon improved, and on 22 November was awarded [[Royal Aero Club]] Aviation Certificate No. 31, flying a [[Howard Wright 1910 Biplane]].

On 18 December 1910, Sopwith won a £4000 prize for the longest flight from England to the Continent in a British-built aeroplane, flying 169&amp;nbsp;miles (272&amp;nbsp;km) in 3 hours 40 minutes. He used the winnings to set up the Sopwith School of Flying at Brooklands.

In June 1912 Sopwith, with Fred Sigrist and others, set up the [[Sopwith Aviation Company]], initially at Brooklands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution = The ABC Motor Cycle | title = Motor Cycle | date = 19 December 1918 | page = 541}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 October 1912 using a [[Wright Model B]] completely rebuilt by Sopwith and fitted with an [[ABC Motors|ABC]] 40&amp;nbsp;hp engine,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = The Sopwith-Wright biplane | newspaper = Flight magazine | date = 23 November 1912 | pages = 1075–79 | url = http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1912/1912%20-%201078.html}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harry Hawker]] took the British Michelin Endurance prize with a flight of 8h 23m. Sopwith Aviation got its first military aircraft order in November 1912, and in December moved to larger premisies in [[Kingston upon Thames]]. The company produced more than 18,000&amp;nbsp;World War I aircraft for the allied forces, including 5747 of the [[Sopwith Camel]] single-seat fighter. Sopwith was awarded the [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] in 1918.

Bankrupted after the war by punitive anti-profiteering taxes, he re-entered the aviation business in 1920 with a new firm named after his chief engineer and test pilot, Harry Hawker. Sopwith became chairman of the new firm, [[Hawker Aircraft]].

He became a [[Knight Bachelor]] in 1953. After the nationalisation in 1977 of the aviation interests of what was by then [[Hawker Siddeley]], he continued to work as a consultant to the company until 1980.

In 1979, Sopwith was inducted into the [[International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame]] at the [[San Diego Air &amp; Space Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;Sprekelmeyer, Linda, editor. ''These We Honor: The International Aerospace Hall of Fame''. Donning Co. Publishers, 2006. [[International Standard Book Number|ISBN]] [[Special:BookSources/978-1-57864-397-4|978-1-57864-397-4]].&lt;/ref&gt;

His authorised biography is ''Pure Luck'' (2005) by Alan Bramson, with a foreword by the [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince of Wales]] ({{ISBN|1-85260-263-5}}). Sir Thomas was interviewed on 8 November 1978 by the art historian Anna Malinovska. The interview is reproduced in ''Voices in Flight'', 2006.

He was a member of the [[Air Squadron]] flying club.

==Yachting==
Sopwith challenged the [[America's Cup]] with his [[J-class yacht]]s, ''[[Endeavour (Yacht)|Endeavour]]'', in 1934, and with ''Endeavour II'' in 1937.  Both yachts were designed by [[Charles Ernest Nicholson|Charles E. Nicholson]].  Sopwith funded, organised and helmed the yachts.  He did not win the Cup but he became a Cup legend by nearly winning it in 1934.  He was inducted into the [[America's Cup Hall of Fame]] in 1995.

In 1927 Sopwith commissioned yacht builders [[Camper and Nicholsons]] to build a luxury motor yacht he named ''Vita''. She was sold in 1929 to [[Sir John Shelley-Rolls, 6th Baronet|Sir John Shelley-Rolls]] who renamed her ''Alastor''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.irishwrecksonline.net/details/Alastor93.htm | publisher = Irish Wrecks On-Line | title = Alastor MY (No. 93)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; During [[World War II]] the [[Royal Navy]] commandeered her to ferry provisions to Navy vessels moored at the entrance to [[Strangford Lough]].  In 1946 a fire gutted her and she sank in Ringhaddy Sound at the back of Strangford Lough.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.divernet.com/cgi-bin/articles.pl?id=1294&amp;sc=&amp;ac=d | publisher = Diver net | title = Wreck Tour: 80, The Alastor }}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937 Sopwith received the yacht ''[[HNoMY Norge|Philante]]'', also built for him by [[Camper and Nicholsons]].  During the War the ship was requisitioned by the Royal Navy and used as a convoy escort vessel, ''[[HMS Philante]]''. After the war the vessel was returned to Sopwith and he sold her to Norway in 1947, to be used as a royal yacht for the [[Haakon VII of Norway|Norwegian king]].

== Personal life ==
Sopwith married Beatrice Hore-Ruthven (1871–1930) in 1914; they had no children.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.genealogics.org/getperson.php?personID=I00131965&amp;tree=LEO|title=Sir Thomas Octave Murdoch Sopwith|last=|first=|date=|website=Genealogics|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beatrice was the daughter of Walter Hore-Ruthven, who in 1919 was created [[Baron Ruthven of Gowrie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.genealogics.org/getperson.php?personID=I00055841&amp;tree=LEO|title=Hon. Beatrice Mary Leslie Hore-Ruthven|last=|first=|date=|website=Genealogics|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Beatrice's death, in 1932 he married Phyllis Brodie Gordon (1892–1978);&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; their son [[Tommy Sopwith (racing driver)|Thomas Edward Brodie Sopwith]] had success in car racing.

Sopwith's house in [[Mayfair]], No. 46 [[Green Street, Mayfair|Green Street]], where he lived from 1934 until 1940, has a [[blue plaque]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://openplaques.org/plaques/366|title=Thomas Sopwith Blue Plaque|publisher=Open plaques|accessdate=13 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940 he moved to [[Warfield Hall]] in Berkshire which he had acquired the previous year.&lt;ref name="heritage"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.warfieldparishcouncil.org.uk/rsc/Heritage1.pdf|title=Heritage Trail|publisher=Warfield Parish Council|format=[[Portable document format|PDF]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130402063634/http://www.warfieldparishcouncil.org.uk/rsc/Heritage1.pdf|archivedate=2 April 2013|deadurl=yes|accessdate=3 August 2013|place=UK|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sopwith's 100th birthday was marked by a [[flypast]] of military aircraft over his home.  He died in [[Hampshire]] on 27 January 1989, aged 101.  His grave and that of his second wife Phyllis Brodie can be found in the grounds of the 11th-century [[All Saints Church, Little Somborne|All Saints Church]] at [[Little Somborne]] near [[Winchester]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Find a Grave|11001321}}&lt;/ref&gt;
