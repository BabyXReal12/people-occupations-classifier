'''John Sidney McCain III''' (born August 29, 1936)&lt;!-- DON'T WIKILINK DATE. SEE NOTE ABOVE. --&gt; is an American politician serving as the [[Seniority in the United States Senate|senior]] [[United States Senator]] from [[Arizona]], a seat to which he was first elected in [[United States Senate election in Arizona, 1986|1986]]. He was the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nominee for [[President of the United States]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 election]], which he lost to [[Barack Obama]].

McCain graduated from the [[United States Naval Academy]] in 1958 and followed [[John S. McCain Jr.|his father]] and [[John S. McCain Sr.|grandfather]]—both [[four-star rank|four-star]] [[Admiral (United States)|admirals]]—into the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]]. He became a [[naval aviator]] and flew [[ground-attack aircraft]] from [[aircraft carriers]]. During the [[Vietnam War]], he was almost killed in the [[1967 USS Forrestal fire|1967 USS ''Forrestal'' fire]]. While McCain was on a bombing mission over [[Hanoi]] in October 1967, he was shot down, seriously injured, and captured by the [[North Vietnam]]ese. He was a [[prisoner of war]] until 1973. McCain experienced episodes of [[torture]] and refused an out-of-sequence early [[repatriation]] offer. The wounds that he sustained during war have left him with lifelong physical disabilities. He retired from the Navy as a [[Captain (United States O-6)|captain]] in 1981 and moved to Arizona, where he entered politics. In 1982, McCain was elected to the [[United States House of Representatives]], where he served two terms. He entered the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] in 1987 and easily won reelection five times, most recently in [[United States Senate election in Arizona, 2016|2016]].

While generally adhering to [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] principles, McCain at times has had a media reputation as a "maverick" for his willingness to disagree with his party on certain issues. After being investigated and largely exonerated in a political influence scandal of the 1980s as a member of the [[Keating Five]], he made [[campaign finance reform]] one of his signature concerns, which eventually resulted in passage of the [[Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act|McCain–Feingold Act]] in 2002. He is also known for his work in the 1990s to restore diplomatic relations with [[Vietnam]], and for his belief that the [[Iraq War]] should have been fought to a successful conclusion. McCain has chaired the [[Senate Commerce Committee]], and he opposed [[pork barrel]] spending. He was a member of the bipartisan group known as the [[Gang of 14]] who played a key role in alleviating a crisis over judicial nominations.

McCain entered the race for the Republican nomination for President in [[John McCain presidential campaign, 2000|2000]], but he lost a [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 2000|heated primary season contest]] to Governor [[George W. Bush]] of Texas. He secured the [[John McCain presidential campaign, 2008|nomination in 2008]] after coming back from early reversals, but was defeated by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nominee [[Barack Obama]] in [[United States presidential election, 2008|the general election]], losing by a 365–173 [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral college margin]]. He subsequently adopted more orthodox conservative stances and attitudes and largely opposed actions of the [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama administration]], especially in regard to foreign policy matters. By 2013, however, he had become a key figure in the Senate for negotiating deals on certain issues in an otherwise partisan environment. In 2015, McCain became Chairman of the [[United States Senate Committee on Armed Services|Senate Armed Services Committee]]. In July 2017, he was diagnosed with brain cancer; since the diagnosis he has taken a reduced role in the Senate, casting his last vote that December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=McCain Says His Brain Cancer Prognosis Is 'Very Poor' |date=September 25, 2017 |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-09-25/mccain-calls-brain-cancer-prognosis-very-poor |publisher=[[Bloomberg News]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |access-date=February 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Repeal and replacement of Obamacare (the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act) was a centerpiece of McCain's 2016 re-election campaign, and in July 2017 he said, "Have no doubt: Congress must replace Obamacare, which has hit Arizonans with some of the highest premium increases in the nation and left 14 of Arizona's 15 counties with only one provider option on the exchanges this year."
