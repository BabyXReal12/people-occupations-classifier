==Early life==
Prince William was born at Lindo Wing of [[St Mary's Hospital, London]], at 9:03{{nbsp}}pm on 21 June 1982 as the first child of [[Charles, Prince of Wales]]—[[heir apparent]] to [[Queen Elizabeth II]]—and [[Diana, Princess of Wales]].&lt;ref name=evnews81/&gt;&lt;ref name=official&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dukeandduchessofcambridge.org/the-duke-of-cambridge/biography|title=The Duke of Cambridge – Biography|publisher=Office of the Prince of Wales|accessdate=6 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=49027 |page=8215 |date=21 June 1982 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His names, William Arthur Philip Louis, were announced by Buckingham Palace on 28 June.&lt;ref name="evnews81"&gt;{{cite news|title=Prince William's his name|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=K4RGAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=nDINAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1118,3639121&amp;dq=diana+spencer&amp;hl=en|accessdate=23 July 2013|newspaper=The Evening News|date=28 July 1982|agency=AP|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was [[baptism|baptised]] by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Robert Runcie]], in the Music Room of [[Buckingham Palace]] on 4 August, the 82nd birthday of his paternal great-grandmother [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]] .&lt;ref name="pbp5aug"&gt;{{cite news|title=William baptized|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=9f8sAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=es0FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3834,2455732&amp;dq=princess+diana&amp;hl=en|accessdate=31 May 2013|newspaper=The Palm Beach Post|date=5 August 1982|agency=AP|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group="fn"|William had six godparents: former King [[Constantine II of Greece]] (his paternal second cousin once removed); [[Princess Alexandra, Lady Ogilvy|Princess Alexandra, The Honourable Mrs Ogilvy]] (his paternal first cousin twice removed); the [[Natalia Grosvenor, Duchess of Westminster|Duchess of Westminster]]; [[Lady Susan Hussey]]; [[Norton Knatchbull, 8th Baron Brabourne|Lord Romsey]] (his paternal second cousin once removed); and Sir [[Laurens van der Post]].&lt;ref name="evnews81" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Yvonne"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://users.uniserve.com/~canyon/christenings.htm#Christenings|title=Yvonne's Royalty Home Page – Royal Christenings |publisher=Uniserve|accessdate=29 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} He was the first child born to a Prince and Princess of Wales since [[Prince John of the United Kingdom|Prince John]] in 1905.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Princess Diana enters hospital in early labor|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=MyBAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=cFgMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2686,2259663&amp;dq=frances+ruth+roche&amp;hl=en|accessdate=21 July 2013|newspaper=Youngstown Vindicator|date=21 June 1982|agency=AP|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; William's parents affectionately called him "Wombat"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19190534/ns/dateline_nbc-a_conversation_with_william_and_harry/ Dateline NBC], ''[[NBC]]'', 6 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; or "Wills"—a name coined by the press.&lt;ref name="The Sunday Herald"&gt;{{Cite news|title=The Saint that looked after Wills|work=The Sunday Herald|date=26 June 2005|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since his birth, William has been second in the [[line of succession to the British throne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.royal.uk/succession|title=Succession|publisher=Royal Household |date=30 May 2016 |accessdate=30 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At age seven, he reportedly told his mother he wanted to be a police officer when he was older so that he might be able to protect her; a statement to which his five-year-old brother [[Prince Harry|Harry]] reportedly replied, "Oh, no you can't.

William began accompanying his parents on official visits at an early age. In 1983, he accompanied them on a tour to Australia and New Zealand,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/personalprofiles/theprinceofwales/atwork/supportingthequeen/countriesvisited/index.html |title=The Prince of Wales – Countries Visited |publisher=Princeofwales.gov.uk |accessdate=15 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202113324/http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/personalprofiles/theprinceofwales/atwork/supportingthequeen/countriesvisited/index.html |archivedate=2 February 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; a decision made by Diana. The decision was considered to be unconventional because the first- and second-in-line to the throne would be travelling together, and because of William's young age.&lt;ref name="people1" /&gt; His first public appearance was on 1 March 1991—[[Saint David's Day]]—during an official visit of his parents to [[Cardiff]]. After arriving by aeroplane, William was taken to [[Llandaff Cathedral]] where he signed the visitors' book, showing he is left-handed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/gloucestershire/content/articles/2005/05/03/prince_william_feature.shtml|title=The young royals: Prince William|publisher=BBC|date=3 May 2005|accessdate=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 June 1991, William was admitted to [[Royal Berkshire Hospital]] after being accidentally hit on the forehead by a fellow student wielding a golf club. He suffered a depressed fracture of the skull and was operated on at [[Great Ormond Street Hospital]], resulting in a permanent scar.&lt;ref name="university"&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/newsandgallery/news/prince_william_marks_the_end_of_the_first_term_of_his_third__1470010393.html|title =Prince William marks the end of the first term of his third university year with an interview|accessdate =31 May 2008|date =14 December 2003|publisher =Prince of Wales|archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20081025092622/http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/newsandgallery/news/prince_william_marks_the_end_of_the_first_term_of_his_third__1470010393.html|archive-date =25 October 2008|dead-url =yes|df =dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2009 interview, he dubbed this scar a "[[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]] scar" and said, "I call it that because it glows sometimes and some people notice it—other times they don't notice it at all".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/5011509/Prince-William-has-Harry-Potter-scar-from-golf-accident.html|title=Prince William has 'Harry Potter' scar from golf accident|newspaper=The Telegraph|location=UK|date=18 March 2009 |first=Andrew|last=Pierce}}&lt;/ref&gt;

William's mother wanted him and his younger brother [[Prince Harry|Harry]] to have wider experiences than are usual for royal children. She took them to [[Walt Disney World]] and [[McDonald's]], as well as [[AIDS]] clinics and shelters for the homeless, and bought them items typically owned by teenagers, such as video games.&lt;ref name="people1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.people.com/people/prince_william/biography|title=Prince William Biography|newspaper=People|accessdate=15 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diana, who was by then divorced from Charles, [[Death of Diana, Princess of Wales|died in a car accident]] in the early hours of 31 August 1997. William, then aged 15, together with  his 12-year-old brother and their father, were staying at [[Balmoral Castle]] at the time. The Prince of Wales waited until his sons awoke the following morning to tell them about their mother's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/conspiracy_files/6217366.stm |title=Timeline: How Diana died |publisher=BBC News |date=14 December 2006 |accessdate=15 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; William accompanied his father, brother, paternal grandfather [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]], and his maternal uncle [[Charles Spencer, 9th Earl Spencer]], at his [[Funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales|mother's funeral]]; they walked behind the funeral cortège from Buckingham Palace to [[Westminster Abbey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/september/6/newsid_2502000/2502307.stm|title=BBC ON THIS DAY – 6–1997: Diana's funeral watched by millions|publisher=BBC|date=6 September 1997|location=London|accessdate=26 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==

William was educated at [[independent school (United Kingdom)|independent schools]], starting at Jane Mynors' nursery school and the pre-preparatory [[Wetherby School]], both in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wetherby Pre-Preparatory School|url=http://www.londonpreprep.com/schools/boys/wetherby-school/|publisher=London Pre-Prep|accessdate=23 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this, he attended [[Ludgrove School]] near [[Wokingham]], Berkshire, and was privately tutored during summers by [[Rory Stewart]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/oct/26/rory-stewart-penrith-tory-seat |location=London |work= [[The Guardian]] | first=Allegra | last=Stratton | title=Former royal tutor Rory Stewart selected for safe Tory seat | date=26 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Ludgrove, he participated in [[association football|football]], swimming, basketball, [[clay pigeon shooting]], and [[cross country running]]. He sat the entrance exam to [[Eton College]] and was admitted. There, he studied Geography, Biology, and History of Art at [[GCE Advanced Level|A-Level]], obtaining an 'A' in Geography, a 'C' in Biology, and a 'B' in History of Art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/newsandgallery/news/prince_william_gives_an_interview_at_the_start_of_his_univer_422216032.html |title=Prince William gives an interview at the start of his university career |date=22 September 2001 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113130840/http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/newsandgallery/news/prince_william_gives_an_interview_at_the_start_of_his_univer_422216032.html |archivedate=13 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=What is it like at Eton College? |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/4634031.stm |publisher=BBC News |date=4 July 2005 |accessdate=11 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bates |first=Stephen |date=18 August 2000 |title=William makes the grade |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/aug/18/alevels2000.alevels4 |newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Eton, he took up [[water polo]] and continued to play football, captaining his house team.&lt;ref name="princeofwales1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/personalprofiles/princewilliam/interests/ |title=The Prince of Wales – Interests |publisher=Princeofwales.gov.uk |accessdate=15 October 2008 |archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20080616074353/http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/personalprofiles/princewilliam/interests/ |archivedate =16 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decision to place William in Eton went against the family tradition of sending royal children to [[Gordonstoun]], which William's grandfather, father, two uncles, and two cousins all attended. Diana's father and brother both attended Eton.&lt;ref name="people1" /&gt; The Royal Family and the tabloid press agreed William would be allowed to study free from intrusion in exchange for regular updates about his life. The chairman of the [[Press Complaints Commission]] [[John Wakeham]] said of the arrangement, "Prince William is not an institution; nor a soap star; nor a football hero. He is a boy: in the next few years, perhaps the most important and sometimes painful part of his life, he will grow up and become a man."&lt;ref name="people1" /&gt;

After completing his studies at Eton, William took a gap year, during which he took part in [[British Army]] training exercises in Belize,&lt;ref name="BBC Belize"&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Rugged prince scores PR triumph |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1064991.stm |publisher=BBC News |date=11 December 2000 |accessdate=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; worked on English dairy farms, visited Africa,&lt;ref&gt;Prince of Wales.gov [http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/personalprofiles/thedukeandduchessofcambridge/thedukeofcambridge/biography/gapyear/ personalprofiles] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110602083612/http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/personalprofiles/thedukeandduchessofcambridge/thedukeofcambridge/biography/gapyear/ |date=2 June 2011 }} &amp; royal.gov [https://www.royal.uk/the-duke-of-cambridge The Duke of Cambridge] Retrieved 8 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and for ten weeks taught children in southern Chile. As part of the [[Raleigh International]] program in the town of [[Tortel]], William lived with other young volunteers, sharing in the common household chores—including cleaning the toilet—and also volunteered as a guest disc jockey at a local radio station.&lt;ref name="BBC Belize" /&gt; His interest in African culture prompted him to teach himself [[Swahili language|Swahili]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2003/06/21/prince-william-celebrates-21st-birthday-with-african-themed-party.html|title=Prince William Celebrates 21st Birthday With African-Themed Party|publisher=Fox News|date=21 June 2003|accessdate=20 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2001, William was back in the United Kingdom and had enrolled at the [[University of St Andrews]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Summerskill |first=Ben |author-link=Ben Summerskill |date=23 September 2001 |title=Welcome to Will's new world |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/sep/23/education.students |newspaper=[[The Observer]] |location=London |accessdate=15 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Howie |first=Michael |date=24 June 2005 |title= William Wales M.A. collects his degree |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/uk/william-wales-m-a-collects-his-degree-1-717426 |newspaper=[[The Scotsman]] |accessdate=15 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; News of this caused a temporary increase in the number of applications to St Andrews, mostly from young women who wanted an opportunity to meet him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/newsandgallery/news/prince_william_gives_an_interview_at_the_start_of_his_univer_422216032.html |title=The Prince of Wales – Prince William gives an interview at the start of his university career |publisher=Princeofwales.gov.uk |date=22 September 2001 |accessdate=15 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113130840/http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/newsandgallery/news/prince_william_gives_an_interview_at_the_start_of_his_univer_422216032.html |archivedate=13 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The extra attention did not deter him; he embarked on a degree course in [[History of art|Art History]], later changing his main subject to Geography, and earned a [[Master of Arts (Scotland)|Scottish Master of Arts degree]] with [[British undergraduate degree classification|upper second class honours]]. While at university, he represented the Scottish national universities water polo team at the Celtic Nations tournament in 2004.&lt;ref name="princeofwales1" /&gt; He was known as "Steve" by other students to avoid any journalists overhearing and realising his identity.&lt;ref name="The Sunday Herald" /&gt;

William returned to St Andrews in February 2011 as patron of the university's 600th Anniversary Appeal.&lt;ref&gt;St-Andrews University (charity registered No SC013532) [http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/news/archive/2011/Title,65130,en.html News/archive] – Andreea Nemes [http://www.thesaint-online.com/2011/03/royal-visit-launches-600th-anniversary/ thesaint-online] Retrieved 27 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

To prepare for his eventual management of the [[Duchy of Cornwall]], in 2014 William enrolled in a vocational agricultural management course at Cambridge, which was organised by the [[Cambridge Programme for Sustainability Leadership]] (CPSL), of which his father is patron.&lt;ref name="arbiter"&gt;{{cite news|title=Opinion: Why Prince William is right to go back to school|author=Victoria Arbiter |url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/01/08/opinion/prince-william-school/|accessdate=14 April 2016|work=[[CNN]]|date=8 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-25639442|title=Prince William begins agriculture course at Cambridge|publisher=BBC|date=7 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/prince-william/10542703/Duke-of-Cambridge-to-study-agriculture-at-Cambridge-University.html|title=Duke of Cambridge to study agriculture at Cambridge University|publisher=Telegraph Media|author=Rayner, Gordon|date=30 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The estate is a "£760 million (about $1.25 billion) entity established in 1337 to provide a private income for use by the reigning monarch's eldest son", which William will inherit if his father becomes king.&lt;ref name="arbiter"/&gt;

===Military training and secondments===
Having decided to follow a military career, in October 2005 William attended the four-day [[Army Officer Selection Board|Regular Commissions Board]] at [[Westbury, Wiltshire|Westbury]] in Wiltshire, where he underwent selection to judge his suitability to become an army officer. He passed selection and was admitted to the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]] in January 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1501217/Prince-William-to-join-his-brother-at-Sandhurst.html |work= [[The Daily Telegraph]] |location=London | title=Prince William to join his brother at Sandhurst | first=Caroline | last=Davies | date=22 October 2005 | accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After completing the course, William was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant at Sandhurst on 15 December 2006; the graduation parade was attended by the Queen and the Prince of Wales, along with other members of the Royal Family. William officially received his commission as a [[Lieutenant (British Army and Royal Marines)|lieutenant]] at midnight. As "Lieutenant Wales"—a name based on his father's title Prince of Wales—he followed his younger brother&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/5367862.stm |title=William joining Harry's regiment |publisher=BBC News |date=21 September 2006 |accessdate=17 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; into the [[Blues and Royals]] as a troop commander in an armoured reconnaissance unit, after which he spent four months training for the post at [[Bovington Camp]], Dorset.

Though [[Major-General (United Kingdom)|Major-General]] [[Sir Sebastian Roberts]], General Officer commanding the [[Household Division]], had said William's deployment was possible, the Prince's position as second-in-line to the throne and the convention of ministers advising against placing that person into dangerous situations cast doubts on William's chances of seeing combat. These doubts increased after Prince Harry's deployment was cancelled in 2007 due to "specific threats". William, instead, went on to train in the [[Royal Navy]] and [[Royal Air Force]], obtaining his commission as a [[sub-lieutenant]] in the former and [[flying officer]] in the latter—both broadly equivalent to the army rank of lieutenant. After completing his training, William undertook an attachment with the Royal Air Force, undergoing an intensive, four-month training course at [[RAF Cranwell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.meeja.com.au/index.php?display_article_id=217 |title=Prince William ready for Search and Rescue role |publisher=meeja.com.au |date=16 September 2008 |accessdate=16 September 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081019214531/http://www.meeja.com.au/index.php?display_article_id=217 |archivedate=19 October 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pierce"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/theroyalfamily/4218703/Prince-William-starts-as-a-search-and-rescue-helicopter-pilot.html |title=Prince William starts as a search and rescue helicopter pilot |accessdate=18 January 2009 |last=Pierce |first=Andrew |date=13 January 2009 |work= [[The Daily Telegraph]] |location=London }}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon completing the course on 11 April 2008, he was presented with his [[Aircrew brevet|RAF wings]] by his father,&lt;ref name="smh1"&gt;{{Cite news|author = Staff | url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/kate-watches-william-get-his-wings/2008/04/12/1207856847954.html |title=Kate watches William get his wings | publisher = [[Deutsche Presse-Agentur]] (via ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'') |date=12 April 2008|accessdate= 26 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; who had received his own wings after training at Cranwell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7340692.stm |title=Prince William awarded RAF wings |publisher=BBC News |date=11 April 2008 |accessdate=2 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this secondment, William flew to Afghanistan in a [[Boeing C-17 Globemaster III|C-17 Globemaster]] that repatriated the body of Trooper Robert Pearson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7374589.stm |title=William visits Afghanistan troops |publisher=BBC News |date=30 April 2008 |accessdate=30 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

William was then seconded to train with the Royal Navy from June to August 2008, during which he spent three weeks at the [[Britannia Royal Naval College]] training on units of the surface fleet and submarines, as well as with the [[Fleet Air Arm]] and the [[Royal Marines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7429261.stm |title=William's Navy posting revealed |publisher=BBC News |date=31 May 2008 |accessdate=31 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spent a day on submarine [[HMS Talent (S92)|HMS ''Talent'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Allen |first=Nick |date=20 June 2008 |title=Prince William in secret submarine mission |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/2162027/Prince-William-in-secret-submarine-mission.html |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |accessdate=30 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a five-week deployment on [[HMS Iron Duke (F234)|HMS ''Iron Duke'']] in the Caribbean, he took part in a joint operation with the [[United States Coast Guard]] that identified and captured a speedboat carrying {{Convert|900|kg|lb|abbr=on}} of [[cocaine]] worth about £40&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/europe/07/02/prince.william/index.html |title=Prince William helps bust $80m drug smuggling boat |work=CNN |date=2 July 2008 |accessdate=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7485365.stm |title=William's ship seizes drugs haul |publisher=BBC News |date=3 July 2008 |accessdate=30 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ship also took part in other raids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Browning |first=Eliza |date=28 July 2008 |title=Prince William in Caribbean Drug Bust |url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/story?id=5461747 |publisher=[[ABC News]] |accessdate=30 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of William's future royal role, a long-term career in the military was considered out-of-the-question; due to his position, his desire to see active service was unlikely to be fulfilled. William originally joined the military on a short-service commission lasting three years. It was announced in September 2008, however, that he would be extending his forces career in 2008 by accepting another secondment that included working at the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] (MOD) and non-operational flying with the Army Air Corps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/mediacentre/pressreleases/prince_william_military_secondments_in_autumn_2008_1233465855.html|title=Prince William: Military Secondments in Autumn, 2008|date=31 July 2008|publisher=princeofwales.gov.uk|accessdate=30 August 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915053013/http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/mediacentre/pressreleases/prince_william_military_secondments_in_autumn_2008_1233465855.html|archivedate=15 September 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later announced that he would transfer from the Army to the RAF to train as a full-time [[search and rescue]] helicopter pilot, a role that would enable him to take an active role in the armed forces without being deployed on combat operations.

In January 2009, William transferred his commission to the RAF and was promoted to [[Flight Lieutenant]]. He trained to become a helicopter pilot with the RAF's [[RAF Search and Rescue Force|Search and Rescue Force]]. In January 2010, he graduated from the [[Defence Helicopter Flying School]] at [[RAF Shawbury]], where he had been under the instruction of Squadron Leader Craig Finch.&lt;ref name="bonnett"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/UK-News/Prince-William-Graduates-From-Advanced-Helicopter-Training-Prince-Charles-Presents-Certificate/Article/201001315524625?lpos=UK_News_Top_Stories_Header_4&amp;lid=ARTICLE_15524625_Prince_William_Graduates_From_Advanced_Helicopter_Training%2C_Prince_Charles_Presents_Certificate|title=Royal Heir Force: Prince's Career Takes Off|last=Bonnett|first=Tom|date=15 January 2010|work=[[Sky News]]|accessdate=16 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 January 2010, he transferred to the Search and Rescue Training Unit at [[RAF Valley]], [[Anglesey]], to receive training on the [[Westland Sea King|Sea King]] search and rescue helicopter; he graduated from this course on 17 September 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/8480634.stm |title=Prince William starts RAF rescue training on Anglesey |publisher=BBC News |date=26 January 2010 |accessdate=26 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This made him the first member of the British royal family since [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] to live in Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=The Tatler List – Duke of Cambridge |url=http://www.tatler.com/the-tatler-list/p/duke-of-cambridge |publisher=[[Tatler]] |accessdate=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

William's first rescue mission as co-pilot of an RAF Sea King was a response to an emergency call from the Liverpool Coastguard on 2 October 2010. William—who was excited to take part in an active mission—and the other three crew members, flew from their base at RAF Valley to an offshore gas rig in [[Morecambe Bay]], from where a man who had suffered a suspected heart attack was airlifted to hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-north-west-wales-11476357 |title=Co-pilot Prince William rescues man from oil rig |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=5 October 2010 |accessdate=17 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2011, he participated in a search-and-rescue mission involving a cargo ship that was sinking in the Irish Sea; William, as a co-pilot, helped rescue two sailors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Bingham |first1=John |last2=Bunyan |first2=Nigel |date=27 November 2011 |title=Prince William spearheads rescue for stricken Russian sailors |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/prince-william/8918754/Prince-William-spearheads-rescue-for-stricken-Russian-sailors.html |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |accessdate=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, it was announced that William would accept a full-time role as a pilot with the [[East Anglian Air Ambulance]] (EAAA) based at [[Cambridge Airport]]. Despite his qualifications as a military helicopter pilot, William needed a civil pilot's licence and further training before being permitted to take command of the Air Ambulance.

Upon graduation from university, William began to undertake public duties of his own, as well as obtaining private work experience by interning in [[land management]] at [[Chatsworth House]] and in banking at [[HSBC]].&lt;ref name="people1" /&gt;

At the age of 21, Prince William was appointed as a [[Counsellor of State]], and first served in that capacity when the Queen was in Nigeria to attend the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 2003|Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting]] in 2003.

[[File:Prince William, Duke of Cambridge and Tel Aviv mayor Ron Huldai.jpg|thumb|William and the mayor of Tel Aviv, [[Ron Huldai]], in Israel, June 2018]]
In June 2018, Prince William visited [[Israel]] and [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], being the first British royal to visit the area officially since the expiry of the [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|British Mandate]]. He visited [[Tel Aviv]], meeting with mayor [[Ron Huldai]] and touring the beach area and city centre; Jerusalem, meeting with President [[Reuven Rivlin]] and Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]]; and [[Ramallah]], meeting with Palestinian president [[Mahmoud Abbas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-5297273,00.html |title=The British interest behind Prince William's Israel visit |last=Nadav |first=Eyal |date=26 June 2018 |website=ynetnews.co.il |access-date=27 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal interests==

Following his parents' examples, William took interest in various causes from a relatively early age. His mother's charitable work with HIV/AIDS aid and prevention and his father's work with the natural environment and the inner-city disadvantaged directed William into those areas. He also showed a desire to focus on the needy in Africa, sometimes working with his brother's charity, [[Sentebale]].

===Humanitarian and environmental causes===
William became aware of HIV/AIDS in the mid-1990s, when his mother began to take her two sons to visit shelters and clinics for those suffering from the disease. In January 2005, William and his brother volunteered at a British [[Red Cross]] aid distribution centre to pack emergency supplies for countries that were affected by the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|2004 Boxing Day tsunami]].&lt;ref name="WillsPatron"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/Page5999.asp |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204011941/http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/Page5999.asp |archivedate=4 February 2009 |title=The Royal Family – HRH The Prince of Wales – Prince William – Charities and Patronages |publisher=Buckingham Palace |accessdate=29 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in September, William granted his [[patronage]] to [[Centrepoint (charity)|Centrepoint]], a charity that assists the homeless.&lt;ref name="POWPatron"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/personalprofiles/princewilliamprinceharry/princewilliam/atwork/charitiesandpatronages/ |title=The Prince of Wales – Prince William – At Work – Charities and Patronages |publisher=Clarence House |accessdate=29 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429161757/http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/personalprofiles/princewilliamprinceharry/princewilliam/atwork/charitiesandpatronages/ |archivedate=29 April 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="centrepoint"&gt;{{cite web|title=Centrepoint – Our patron |url=http://www.centrepoint.org.uk/our-patron |accessdate=29 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501110502/http://www.centrepoint.org.uk/our-patron |archivedate=1 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the period when his mother had been patron of Centrepoint, he had accompanied her on visits to its headquarters and projects.

William also worked in the children's unit at [[The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust|The Royal Marsden Hospital]] for two days of work experience in 2005, as well as helping out in the medical research, catering, and fund raising departments.&lt;ref name="POWPatron" /&gt; The same year, he spent two weeks in North Wales with a [[Mountain rescue in England and Wales|mountain rescue team]].&lt;ref name="WillsPatron" /&gt; In May 2007, William became patron of both organisations (his mother had also previously been patron of the Royal Marsden Hospital) and he became attracted to Mountain Rescue England and Wales in order to, in his words, "highlight and celebrate the vital, selfless and courageous work of our mountain rescue organisations".&lt;ref name="POWPatron" /&gt;

Prince William also became a patron of the [[Tusk Trust]] in December 2005,&lt;ref name="POWPatron" /&gt; a charity that works towards conserving wildlife and initiating community development, including providing education, across Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.tusk.org/about-us/ |title=About Us |publisher=Tusk Trust |accessdate=7 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He became associated with the organisation after he witnessed its work first hand in Africa. Saying "rural African initiatives that foster education, responsibility and participation in the local community light the way to conservation",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cycleoflife2008.com/content/pwquote.asp |title=Cycle of Life: News |publisher=Cycle of Life |year=2007 |accessdate=29 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708214938/http://www.cycleoflife2008.com/content/pwquote.asp |archivedate=8 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; he carried out his first official duty with the trust in launching a {{convert|5000|mi|km|adj=on}} bike ride across the African continent in 2007. In 2010, he also became a patron of [[100 Women in Hedge Funds]] Philanthropic Initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/mediacentre/pressreleases/prince_william_to_become_patron_of_100_women_in_hedge_funds__1457625743.html|title=Prince William to become Patron of 100 Women in Hedge Funds' philanthropic initiatives|accessdate=13 November 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113130749/http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/mediacentre/pressreleases/prince_william_to_become_patron_of_100_women_in_hedge_funds__1457625743.html|archive-date=13 January 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011, the Duke and Duchess set up a gift fund held by [[The Royal Foundation of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry|The Foundation of Prince William and Prince Harry]] to allow well-wishers who wanted to give them a wedding gift to donate money to charities instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royalweddingcharityfund.org/ |title=The Prince William &amp; Miss Catherine Middleton Charitable Gift Fund |publisher=royalweddingcharityfund.org |accessdate=4 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110318110546/http://www.royalweddingcharityfund.org/ |archivedate=18 March 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The gift fund supported 26 charities of the couple's choice, incorporating the armed forces, children, the elderly, art, sport and conservation.

In 2006, William, along with other Sandhurst officers, took part in running one mile to support the charity [[Sport Relief]], as he had done in 2004 with a team from [[Clarence House]]. In May 2007, William became patron of the English Schools' Swimming Association.&lt;ref name="POWPatron" /&gt; In 2013 he succeeded his grandfather the [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Duke of Edinburgh]] as president of the UK charity [[Fields in Trust]], formerly the [[National Playing Fields Association]].&lt;ref name=NFPA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fieldsintrust.org/Royal_patronage.aspx|website=Fields in Trust|title=Royal Patronage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2010, William and British Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] attended a meeting with [[FIFA]] vice-president [[Chung Mong-joon]] in which Chung suggested a vote-trading deal for the right to host the 2018 World Cup in England. The English delegation reported the attempt to FIFA's ethics investigator because they considered vote-swapping to be a violation of anti-collusion rules.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/06/27/prince-william-david-cameron-caught-fifa-corruption-scandal/ Prince William and David Cameron caught up in Fifa corruption scandal]".

In May 2014 the Duke followed in the footsteps of his father and grandfather to become president of the [[British Sub-Aqua Club]] (BSAC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bsac.com/page.asp?section%3D4623%26sectionTitle%3DBSAC+President |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904080208/http://www.bsac.com/page.asp?section=4623&amp;sectionTitle=BSAC%2BPresident |archivedate=4 September 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

===Bachelorhood===
As with his father, William's private life became the subject of tabloid speculation, especially around his relationship with [[Catherine Middleton]], who had been one of William's university [[Roommate|flatmates]] and whom William began dating in 2003. Middleton attended William's passing-out parade at Sandhurst, which was the first high-profile event that she attended as his guest. The relationship between them was followed so closely that [[bookmaker]]s took bets on the possibility of marriage, and the retail chain [[Woolworths Group|Woolworths]] produced [[Souvenir|memorabilia]] bearing the likenesses of the couple.&lt;ref name="CTV Split"&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/prince-william-girlfriend-end-their-relationship-1.237322 |title=Prince William, girlfriend end their relationship |publisher=CTV News |date=14 April 2007 |accessdate=16 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Media attention became so intense that William formally  asked the press to keep their distance from Middleton.&lt;ref name="CTV Split" /&gt;

It was reported in April 2007 that the couple had split,&lt;ref name="CTV Split" /&gt; though Middleton, in June, attended a party at [[Lulworth Camp]] as a guest of Prince William and in July the [[Concert for Diana]], which had been organised by Princes William and Harry. In subsequent months, she accompanied William on holiday and joined the Royal Family on private outings and at public events.

===Marriage and fatherhood===

As a [[British prince]], William does not use a surname for everyday purposes. For formal and ceremonial purposes, the children of the Prince of Wales use the title of "prince" or "princess" before their [[Christian name]] and their father's territorial designation after it. Thus, Prince William was styled as "Prince William of Wales". Such territorial designations are discarded by women when they marry and by men if they are given a [[peerage]] of their own,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/Page5657.asp |title=Titles and succession: Royal Family name|publisher=Royal|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080804094423/http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/Page5657.asp |archivedate=4 August 2008|accessdate=15 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as when Prince William was given his dukedom.

For the male-line grandchildren of Elizabeth II, however, there is currently some uncertainty over the correct form of family surname to use, or even whether there is a surname. The Queen has stipulated that all her male-line descendants "who do not bear the titular dignity of prince" shall use Mountbatten-Windsor as their family surname (although Letters Patent exist stipulating the name Windsor, but with the same caveat). Princes William and Harry both used Wales as their surname for military purposes; this continues to be the case for William since his creation as Duke of Cambridge.&lt;ref name="Duke of Cambridge, Flt Lt Wales"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dukeandduchessofcambridge.org/news-and-diary/working-day-the-life-of-flight-lieutenant-wales |title=A working day in the life of Flight Lieutenant Wales |publisher=[[Clarence House]] |date=20 November 2012 |accessdate=30 January 2013 |quote=The Duke of Cambridge – who is known in his Royal Air Force working life as Flight Lieutenant Wales |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130130091753/http://www.dukeandduchessofcambridge.org/news-and-diary/working-day-the-life-of-flight-lieutenant-wales |archivedate=30 January 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancestry==
Prince William is a member of the [[House of Windsor]]. By direct paternal ancestry, via his grandfather the [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Duke of Edinburgh]], he is a descendant of [[Elimar I, Count of Oldenburg]], from the [[House of Oldenburg]], one of Europe's oldest royal houses, and more specifically the [[cadet branch]] known as the [[House of Glücksburg]], founded by William's paternal ancestor [[Friedrich Wilhelm, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg]]. William's ancestors on the male line include five kings: [[Christian I of Denmark]], [[Frederick I of Denmark]], [[Christian III of Denmark]], [[Christian IX of Denmark]] and [[George I of Greece]], and also eleven [[Count of Oldenburg|counts of Oldenburg]], two dukes of [[Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg]], five dukes of [[Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Beck]], and one duke of [[Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg]].&lt;ref name="huberty"&gt;Huberty, Michel (1994). ''L'Allemagne dynastique''. Volume 7 ("Oldenbourg"). Le Perreux-sur-Marne:  [[Giraud (publishers)|Giraud]]. {{ISBN|2-901138-07-1}}, {{ISBN|978-2-901138-07-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Via his mother, William descends from: the [[Earl Spencer (peerage)|Earls Spencer]] (a cadet branch of the [[Spencer family]], descended from the [[Earl of Sunderland|Earls of Sunderland]]; the senior branch are now also [[Duke of Marlborough (title)|Dukes of Marlborough]]); the [[Baron Fermoy|Barons Fermoy]]; and more anciently from [[Henry FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Grafton]], and [[Charles Lennox, 1st Duke of Richmond]], two of the illegitimate sons of King [[Charles II of England|Charles II]]. As king, William would be the first monarch since [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Anne]] to descend from [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], and the first to descend from Charles II.&lt;ref name="TOI" /&gt;&lt;ref name="williamson"/&gt;

William descends [[Matrilineality|matrilineally]] from Eliza Kewark, a housekeeper for his great-great-great-great-great-grandfather Theodore Forbes, a Scottish merchant who worked for the East India Company in [[Surat]]. She is variously described in contemporary documents as "a dark-skinned native woman", "an Armenian woman from Bombay", and "Mrs. Forbesian".&lt;ref name="williamson"&gt;Williamson, D (1981) "The Ancestry of Lady Diana Spencer". ''Genealogist's Magazine'' '''20'''(6): 192–199; '''20'''(8): 281–282&lt;/ref&gt; Genealogist [[William Addams Reitwiesner]] assumed she was Armenian.&lt;ref name="wargs"&gt;{{cite web|last=Reitwiesner|first=William Addams|url=http://www.wargs.com/essays/ethnic.html|title=The Ethnic ancestry of Prince William|publisher=wargs.com|year=2006|accessdate=24 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2013, [[BritainsDNA]] announced that [[genealogical DNA test]]s on two of William's distant matrilineal cousins confirm that Eliza Kewark was matrilineally of [[Indian people|Indian]] descent.&lt;ref name="TOI"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sinha|first=Kounteya|title=Hunt on for Prince William's distant cousins in Surat|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-06-16/uk/40006496_1_indian-dna-east-india-company-mtdna|accessdate=11 August 2013|newspaper=The Times of India|date=16 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Royal Revelation |url=http://www.britainsdna.com/royal-revelation |publisher=BritainsDNA |accessdate=11 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130717092958/http://www.britainsdna.com/royal-revelation |archivedate=17 July 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[The Times]]|date=14 June 2013|title=Revealed: the  Indian ancestry of William|first1=David|last1=Brown|page=1|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/uk/article3790940.ece|subscription=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hern|first=Alex|title=Are there ethical lapses in the Times' story on William's 'Indian ancestry'?|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/media/2013/06/are-there-ethical-lapses-times-story-williams-indian-ancestry|accessdate=11 August 2013|newspaper=New Statesman|date=14 June 2013|quote=Although Eliza Kewark was indeed thought of as Armenian, it's not particularly surprising that she would have had Indian ancestors; the Armenian diaspora had been in India for centuries at the time of her birth, and even the most insular communities tend to experience genetic mixing over that timescale.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
