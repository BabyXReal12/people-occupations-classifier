'''Sally Kristen Ride''' (May 26, 1951&amp;nbsp;– July 23, 2012) was an American [[engineer]], [[physicist]] and [[astronaut]]. Born in Los Angeles, she joined [[NASA]] in 1978 and became the first American woman in [[outer space|space]] in 1983. Ride was the third woman in space overall, after USSR [[cosmonaut]]s [[Valentina Tereshkova]] (1963) and [[Svetlana Savitskaya]] (1982).  Ride remains the youngest American astronaut to have traveled to space, having done so at the age of 32.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/pao/faq/faqanswers.htm |title=Kennedy Space Center FAQ | publisher=NASA/Kennedy Space Center External Relations and Business Development Directorate |accessdate=July 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=10 fascinating things about Astronaut Sally Ride you must know|url=http://news.biharprabha.com/2015/05/10-awesome-things-about-astronaut-sally-ride-you-must-know/|accessdate=May 26, 2015|publisher=news.biharprabha.com|date=May 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After flying twice on the Orbiter [[Space Shuttle Challenger|''Challenger'']], she left NASA in 1987. She worked for two years at [[Stanford University]]'s [[Center for International Security and Cooperation|Center for International Security and Arms Control]], then at the [[University of California, San Diego]] as a professor of physics, primarily researching [[nonlinear optics]] and [[Thomson scattering]]. She served on the committees that investigated the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|''Challenger'']] and [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'']] space shuttle disasters, the only person to participate in both.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news |last=Grady |first=Denise |title=Obituary: American Woman Who Shattered Space Ceiling|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/24/science/space/sally-ride-trailblazing-astronaut-dies-at-61.html?pagewanted=all |newspaper=The New York Times |date=July 23, 2012 |access-date=July 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See [[Rogers Commission Report]] and [[Columbia Accident Investigation Board]]&lt;/ref&gt; Ride died of [[pancreatic cancer]] on July 23, 2012.

== Early life==
The elder child of Dale Burdell Ride and Carol Joyce Ride (née Anderson), Ride was born in Los Angeles. She had one sibling, Karen "Bear" Ride, who is a [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] minister. Both parents were elders in the Presbyterian Church. Ride's mother had worked as a volunteer counselor at a women's correctional facility. Her father had been a political science professor at [[Santa Monica College]].&lt;ref name=obit /&gt;

Ride attended Portola Junior High (now [[Portola Middle School (Tarzana)|Portola Middle School]]) and then [[Birmingham High School]] before graduating from the private [[Harvard-Westlake|Westlake School for Girls]] in Los Angeles on a scholarship.&lt;ref name=obit /&gt; In addition to being interested in science, she was a nationally ranked tennis player. Ride attended [[Swarthmore College]] for three semesters, took physics courses at [[University of California, Los Angeles]], and then entered [[Stanford University]] as a junior, graduating with a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[English studies|English]] and [[physics]]. At Stanford, she earned a master's degree in 1975 and a PhD in physics in 1978 while doing research on the interaction of [[X-rays]] with the interstellar medium.&lt;ref name="ride1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/htmlbios/ride-sk.html |title=Biographical Data: Sally K.

== NASA career ==
[[File:Ride on the Middeck - GPN-2000-001081.jpg|thumb|upright|Ride on [[Space Shuttle Challenger|''Challenger'']]'s mid-deck during [[STS-7]] in 1983]]
{{Listen|type=speech|pos=right|filename=Sally Ride (As Told By NASA Chief Scientist Dr. Ellen Stofan).ogg|title=Sally Ride (As Told By NASA Chief Scientist Dr. Ellen Stofan)|description= }}
Ride was one of 8,000 people who answered an advertisement in the Stanford student newspaper seeking applicants for the [[space program]].&lt;ref name="starchild"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/whos_who_level2/ride.html |title=Dr. Sally Ride |access-date=May 11, 2015 |publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was chosen to join [[NASA]] in 1978.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; During her career, Ride served as the ground-based [[capsule communicator]] (CapCom) for the second and third space shuttle flights ([[STS-2]] and [[STS-3]]) and helped develop the space shuttle's "[[Canadarm]]" robot arm.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Prior to her first space flight, she was subject to media attention due to her gender. During a press conference, she was asked questions such as, "Will the flight affect your reproductive organs?" and "Do you weep when things go wrong on the job?" Despite this and the historical significance of the mission, Ride insisted that she saw herself in only one way—as an astronaut.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|last=Ryan |first=Michael |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20085312,00.html |title=A Ride in Space – NASA, Sally Ride |work=People |accessdate=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 18, 1983, she became the first American woman in space as a crew member on [[space shuttle Challenger|space shuttle ''Challenger'']] for [[STS-7]]. She was preceded by two Soviet women, [[Valentina Tereshkova]] in 1963 and [[Svetlana Savitskaya]] in 1982. The five-person crew of the STS-7 mission deployed two communications satellites and conducted pharmaceutical experiments. Ride was the first woman to use the robot arm in space and the first to use the arm to retrieve a [[satellite]].&lt;ref name="ride1" /&gt;

Her second space flight was [[STS-41-G]] in 1984, also on board ''Challenger''. She spent a total of more than 343 hours in space. Ride had completed eight months of training for her third flight ([[Cancelled Space Shuttle missions#STS-61-M (Challenger)|STS-61-M]], a [[Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System|TDRS]] deployment mission) when the [[space shuttle Challenger disaster|space shuttle ''Challenger'' disaster]] occurred. She was named to the [[Rogers Commission Report|Rogers Commission]] (the presidential commission investigating the accident) and headed its subcommittee on operations. She was the only person to serve on both of the panels investigating shuttle accidents (those for the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|''Challenger'' accident]] and later the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'' disaster]]). Following the Challenger investigation, Ride was assigned to NASA headquarters in Washington, D.C., where she led NASA's first [[strategic planning]] effort, authored a report titled "[[The Ride Report|NASA Leadership and America's Future in Space]]" and founded NASA's Office of Exploration.&lt;ref name="ride1" /&gt; After Sally Ride's death in 2012, [[Donald J. Kutyna|General Donald Kutyna]] revealed that she had discreetly provided him with key information about [[O-rings]] (namely, that they become stiff at low temperatures) that eventually led to identification of the cause of the explosion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = An Oral History Of The Space Shuttle Challenger Disaster|url = http://www.popularmechanics.com/space/a18616/an-oral-history-of-the-space-shuttle-challenger-disaster/|website = Popular Mechanics|date = January 28, 2016|access-date = February 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, Ride left her position in Washington, D.C., to work at the Stanford University [[Center for International Security and Cooperation|Center for International Security and Arms Control]]. In 1989, she became a professor of physics at the [[University of California, San Diego]], and director of the California Space Institute. From the mid-1990s until her death, Ride led two public-outreach programs for NASA—the [[ISS EarthKAM]] and [[MoonKAM|GRAIL MoonKAM]] projects, in cooperation with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and UCSD.

According to [[Roger Boisjoly]], who was the engineer that warned of the technical problems that led to the ''Challenger'' disaster, after the entire workforce of [[Thiokol|Morton-Thiokol]] shunned him Ride was the only public figure to show support for him when he went public with his pre-disaster warnings. Sally Ride hugged him publicly to show her support for his efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/04/us/roger-boisjoly-73-dies-warned-of-shuttle-danger.html |title=Roger Boisjoly, 73, Dies; Warned of Shuttle Danger |first=Douglas |last=Martin |work=The New York Times |date=February 3, 2012 |access-date=May 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
