'''Richard Ira Bong''' (September 24, 1920&amp;nbsp;– August 6, 1945) was a [[United States Army Air Forces]] major and [[Medal of Honor]] recipient in [[World War II]]. He was one of the most decorated American [[fighter pilot]]s and the country's top [[flying ace]] in the war, credited with shooting down 40 Japanese aircraft, all with the [[Lockheed P-38 Lightning]] [[fighter aircraft|fighter]]. He died in California while testing a [[jet aircraft]] shortly before the war ended.

==Early life==
Bong was born in [[Superior, Wisconsin]], the first of nine children son of Carl Bong, an immigrant of [[Sweden]], and Dora Bryce,&lt;!--nee?--&gt; who was an American of Scots-English descent.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.nationalaviation.org/our-enshrinees/bong-richard/ The National Aviation Hall of Fame] &lt;/ref&gt; He grew up on a farm in [[Poplar, Wisconsin|Poplar]], [[Wisconsin]], where he became interested in aircraft at an early age while watching planes fly over the farm carrying mail for President [[Calvin Coolidge]]'s summer [[White House]] in Superior,&lt;ref&gt; [https://www.bvhcenter.org/bong-bio/ Veterans Historical Center] &lt;/ref&gt; and was an avid model builder. Bong entered Poplar High School in 1934, where he played the clarinet in the marching band and participated in baseball, basketball, and hockey. Because Poplar was a three-year school at the time, Bong transferred to [[Central High School (Superior, Wisconsin)|Central High School]] in Superior for his senior year, graduating in 1938.{{Sfn|Yenne|2009|p=|pp=22–25}}

He began studying at Superior State Teachers College (the current-day [[University of Wisconsin–Superior]]) in 1938. While there, Bong enrolled in the [[Civilian Pilot Training Program]] and also took private flying lessons. On May 29, 1941, he enlisted in the [[United States Army Air Corps|Army Air Corps]] Aviation Cadet Program. One of his flight instructors was Captain [[Barry Goldwater]] (later [[List of United States Senators from Arizona|a U.S. Senator from Arizona]]).

==United States Army Air Forces==
Bong's ability as a fighter pilot was recognized while he was training in northern California. He was commissioned a [[second lieutenant#United States|second lieutenant]] and awarded his pilot wings on January 19, 1942. His first assignment was as an instructor (gunnery) pilot at Luke Field, Arizona, from January to May 1942. His first operational assignment was on May 6 to the [[49th Fighter Training Squadron|49th Fighter Squadron]] (FS), [[14th Flying Training Wing|14th Fighter Group]] at [[Hamilton Air Force Base|Hamilton Field]], [[California]], where he learned to fly the twin-engine [[Lockheed P-38 Lightning]].

On June 12, 1942, Bong flew very low ("buzzed") over a house in nearby [[San Anselmo, California|San Anselmo]], the home of a pilot who had just been married. He was cited and temporarily grounded for breaking flying rules, along with three other P-38 pilots who had looped around the [[Golden Gate Bridge]] on the same day.&lt;ref&gt;''Dear Mom, So We Have a War'' (1991)&lt;/ref&gt; For looping the Golden Gate Bridge, flying at a low level down Market Street in San Francisco, and blowing the clothes off of an Oakland woman's clothesline, Bong was reprimanded by [[George Kenney|General George C. Kenney]], commanding officer of the [[Fourth Air Force]], who told him, "If you didn't want to fly down Market Street, I wouldn't have you in my Air Force, but you are not to do it any more and I mean what I say." Kenney later wrote, "We needed kids like this lad."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://www.google.com/books?id=tWdbngbCc84C|first = George C.|last = Kenney|authorlink = George Kenney|title = General Kenney Reports: A Personal History of the Pacific War|publisher = Duell, Sloan and Pearce|location = [[New York City]]|year = 1949|pages = 3–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In all subsequent accounts, Bong denied flying under the Golden Gate Bridge.{{sfn|Yenne|2009|p=68}} Nevertheless, Bong was still grounded when the rest of his group was sent without him to England in July 1942. Bong then transferred to another Hamilton Field unit, [[84th Flying Training Squadron|84th Fighter Squadron]] of the [[78th Air Base Wing|78th Fighter Group]]. From there, Bong was sent to the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|Southwest Pacific Area]].

On September 10, 1942, Lt. Bong was assigned to the [[9th Fighter Squadron]], which was flying [[Curtis P-40 Warhawk|P-40 Warhawk]]s, based at [[Darwin, Australia]]. In November, while the squadron waited for delivery of the scarce P-38s, Bong and other 9th FS pilots were reassigned temporarily to fly missions and gain combat experience with the 39th Fighter Squadron, [[35th Fighter Group]], based in [[Port Moresby]], [[New Guinea]]. On December 27, Bong claimed his initial aerial victory, shooting down a [[A6M Zero|Mitsubishi A6M "Zero"]], and a [[Nakajima Ki-43|Nakajima Ki-43 "Oscar"]] over Buna (during the [[Battle of Buna-Gona]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://valor.militarytimes.com/recipient.php?recipientid=2681 Military Ties-Hall of Valor, Richard Bong, Silver Star citation]&lt;/ref&gt; For this action, Bong was awarded the [[Silver Star]].

[[File:Richard Bong in cockpit.jpg|250px|thumb|Major Bong in his P-38]]
Bong rejoined the 9th FS, by then equipped with P-38s, in January 1943; the 49th FG was based at [[Schwimmer Airfield|Schwimmer Field]] near Port Moresby. In April, he was promoted to first lieutenant.&lt;ref name="af.mil"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afhistory.af.mil/FAQs/Fact-Sheets/Article/639628/bong-maj-richard-ira-bong/|title=Factsheets : Maj Richard Ira Bong|last=|first=|date=November 26, 2014|work=Air Force Historical Support Division|accessdate=February 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 26, Bong claimed four Japanese fighters over [[Lae]], in an action that earned him the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]]. In August, he was promoted to captain.&lt;ref name="af.mil"/&gt;

While on leave to the United States the following November and December, Bong met Marjorie Vattendahl at a Superior State Teachers' College homecoming event and began dating her.

After returning to the southwest Pacific in January 1944, he named his P-38 "Marge" and adorned the nose with her photo.&lt;ref&gt;Dick Bong America's Ace of Aces by Gen. [[George C. Kenney]].&lt;/ref&gt; On April 12, Captain Bong shot down his 26th and 27th Japanese aircraft, surpassing [[Eddie Rickenbacker]]'s American record of 26 credited victories in [[World War I]]. Soon afterwards, he was promoted to major by [[George Kenney|General George Kenney]] and dispatched to the United States to see General Arnold, who gave him a leave.&lt;ref name="HistoryNet"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historynet.com/richard-ira-bong-american-world-war-ii-ace-of-aces.htm|title=Richard Ira Bong: American World War II Ace of Aces|last=Guttman|first=Jon|date=November 7, 2016|website=HistoryNet.com|language=en-US|access-date=August 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="af.mil"/&gt; After visiting training bases and going on a 15-state bond promotion tour, Bong returned to New Guinea in September. He was assigned to the [[V Fighter Command]] staff as an advanced gunnery instructor with permission to go on missions but not to seek combat.&lt;ref name="HistoryNet"/&gt; Bong continued flying from [[Tacloban]], [[Leyte]], during the [[Philippines campaign (1944–45)|Philippines campaign]]; by December 17, he had increased his air-to-air victory claims to 40.

Bong considered his gunnery accuracy to be poor, so he compensated by getting as close to his targets as possible to make sure he hit them. In some cases he flew through the debris of exploding enemy aircraft, and on one occasion collided with his target, which he claimed as a "probable" victory.

On the recommendation of General Kenney, the [[Far East Air Force (United States)|Far East Air Force]] commander, Bong received the [[Medal of Honor]] from General [[Douglas MacArthur]] in a special ceremony in December 1944. Bong's Medal of Honor citation says that he flew combat missions despite his status as an instructor, which was one of his duties as standardization officer for V Fighter Command. His rank of major would have qualified him for a squadron command, but he always flew as a flight (four-plane) or element (two-plane) leader.

In January 1945, Kenney sent America's [[List of aces of aces|ace of aces]] home for good. Bong married Vattendahl on February 10, 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Elaine Woo. "[http://articles.latimes.com/2003/oct/10/local/me-drucker10 Marjorie Drucker, 79; Wife of World War II Ace Richard Bong]". ''Los Angeles Times'', October 10, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; He participated in numerous [[Public relations|PR]] activities, such as promoting the sale of [[war bond]]s.

==Death==
[[File:Lockheed P-80 PN-155.jpg|thumb|Bong was killed in 1945 while testing a [[P-80 Shooting Star|P-80A]] similar to this one.]]
[[File:1945-08-07-Los-Angeles-Times-front-page.jpg|thumb|upright|His death was featured prominently in national newspapers, even though it occurred on the same day as the atomic [[bombing of Hiroshima]].]]

Bong then became a [[test pilot]] assigned to [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]]'s [[Burbank, California]], plant, where he flew [[P-80 Shooting Star]] [[fighter aircraft|jet fighter]]s at the [[Bob Hope Airport|Lockheed Air Terminal]].  On August 6, 1945, the plane's primary fuel pump malfunctioned during takeoff on the acceptance flight of P-80A 44-85048. Bong either forgot to switch to the auxiliary fuel pump, or for some reason was unable to do so.&lt;ref name="yeagerbio"&gt;[[Chuck Yeager|Yeager, Chuck]] and [[Leo Janos|Janos, Leo]]. ''Yeager: An Autobiography''. Pages 227–228 (paperback). New York: Bantam Books, 1986. {{ISBN|0-553-25674-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Bong cleared away from the aircraft, but was too low for his parachute to deploy. The plane crashed into a narrow field at Oxnard St &amp; Satsuma Ave, North Hollywood. His death was front-page news across the country, sharing space with the first news of the [[bombing of Hiroshima]].&lt;ref&gt;The [[New York Times]], the [[Washington Post]], and the [[Los Angeles Times]], among other periodicals, all carried prominent front page stories about Bong's death on August 7, 1945, despite the prevalence of the news on the first atomic bombing. "Jet plane explosion kills Major Bong, Top U.S. Ace," ''New York Times'' (August 7, 1945), p. 1; "Major Bong, top air ace, killed in crash of Army P-80 jet-fighter," ''Washington Post'' (August 6, 1945), p.1; "Jet plane explosion kills Maj. Bong; Ace's 'Shooting Star' blows up in test flight over north Hollywood", ''Los Angeles Times'' (August 6, 1945), p.1.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the crash, Bong had accumulated four hours and fifteen minutes of flight time (totaling 12 flights) in the P-80. The I-16 fuel pump was a later addition to the plane (after an earlier fatal crash) and Bong himself was quoted by Captain Ray Crawford (another P-80 test/acceptance flight pilot who flew the day Bong was killed) as saying that he had forgotten to turn on the I-16 pump on an earlier flight.&lt;ref&gt;Dear Mom, So We Have a War (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

In his autobiography, [[Chuck Yeager]] also writes, however, that part of the ingrained culture of test flying at the time, due to the fearsome mortality rates of the pilots, was anger directed at pilots who died in test flights, to avoid being overcome by sorrow for lost comrades. Bong's brother Carl (who wrote his biography) questions the validity of reported circumstance that Bong repeated the same mistake so soon after mentioning it to another pilot. Carl's book—''Dear Mom, So We Have a War'' (1991)—contains numerous reports and findings from the crash investigations.

Major Richard Ira Bong is buried at Poplar  Cemetery in [[Poplar, Wisconsin]].&lt;ref name=findagrave&gt;{{Find a Grave|2375|work=Claim to Fame: Medal of Honor recipients|accessdate=December 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
