'''Thomas Paul "Tom" Poberezny''' (born October 3, 1946) is a former [[aerobatic]] world champion, as well as chairman of the annual [[Experimental Aircraft Association]] (EAA) [[EAA AirVenture Oshkosh|Fly-In and Convention]] from 1977 to 2011 and president of EAA from 1989 to 2010. He succeeded his father, [[Paul Poberezny]], who founded the organization in 1953.&lt;ref name="b"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbaa.org/news/pr/2011/20110726-064.php|title=NBAA Salutes EAA's Tom Poberezny for Remarkable Contributions to Industry|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He is also one of the founders of the [[Young Eagles]], an EAA program created to give children the opportunity to experience flight and to learn about [[general aviation]].&lt;ref name=NahfInduction/&gt; From his involvement in the EAA, Poberezny is often credited with having led the introduction of the [[light sport aircraft]] industry.&lt;ref name="NAHF bio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalaviation.org/our-enshrinees/poberezny-tom/|title=Poberezny, Tom|publisher=National Aviation Hall of Fame}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eaa.org/en/eaa/eaa-news-and-aviation-news/news/09-29-2016-tom-poberezny-into-national-aviation-hall-of-fame|title=Tom Poberezny Into National Aviation Hall of Fame|publisher=EAA.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==

[[File:Eagles Aerobatic Team Display.jpg|thumb|right|Eagles Aerobatic Team aircraft flown by Poberezny, Hillard, and Soucy on display at the [[EAA Aviation Museum]]]]
Tom Poberezny was surrounded by aviation from the very early stages of his life. Because of his father's early key involvement with EAA, the basement of Tom's childhood home in [[Hales Corners, Wisconsin]] was considered "the regional social center of [aircraft] homebuilding."&lt;ref name="AircraftSpruce"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.aircraftspruce.com/catalog/kitspages/pobereznytom.php?clickkey=55532| title = Tom Poberezny and the Maturing of EAA|accessdate = 2014-11-08|last = Gustafson|first = David|authrolink = |date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Poberezny graduated from [[Northwestern University]] in 1970 with a degree in industrial engineering, and became preoccupied with aviation soon after. He joined the US National Unlimited Aerobatic Team and was part of the team that won the World Championship in 1972 at Salon, France. In 1973 he won the individual US National Unlimited Aerobatic Championship.&lt;ref name="b"/&gt;

In 1971, Poberezny, [[Charlie Hillard]], and [[Gene Soucy]] formed the aerobatic team The Red Devils (soon renamed the Eagles Aerobatic Team) and went on to perform at airshows until the Daytona Skyfest in 1995.&lt;ref name="b"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.wisconsinaviationhalloffame.org/inductees/poberezny_t.htm| title = Hall of Fame Inductee Tom Poberezny|accessdate = March 31, 2016|last = Wisconsin Aviation Hall of Fame|first = |authorlink = |date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="a"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airventure.org/media/Tom_Poberezny.pdf|title=Tom Poberezny one-sheet|publisher=Experimental Aircraft Association|date=April 2009|accessdate=July 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This makes the Eagles the longest-performing aerobatic team with one group of members.&lt;ref name=ICAS&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| vauthors =| title =Charlie Hillard, Air Show Hall of Fame| work =| publisher =| date =| url =http://www.icasfoundation.org/hall_fame/1997/hf_hillard.htm| doi =| accessdate =July 11, 2008| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070815234052/http://www.icasfoundation.org/hall_fame/1997/hf_hillard.htm| archivedate =August 15, 2007| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poberezny also appeared as a pilot in the movie ''[[Cloud Dancer]]'' in 1980.&lt;ref name="c"&gt;http://images.imdb.de/title/tt0080545/fullcredits#cast&lt;/ref&gt;

He was appointed to chairman of the EAA Convention and Fly-In (now known as [[AirVenture]]) in 1977. This annual event takes place in [[Oshkosh, Wisconsin]] and attracts over 750,000 visitors with 10,000 aircraft from 68 countries, making it the world's largest aviation gathering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=| first =| authorlink =| vauthors =| title = AirVenture – A History of The World’s Largest Airshow| work =| publisher =| date =| url = http://www.aviationschoolsonline.com/blog/history-of-airventure| doi = | accessdate =April 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the convention's subsequent growth occurred under the leadership of Tom Poberezny.&lt;ref name="AircraftSpruce"/&gt; In the late 1970s, he led the campaign to build the present-day [[EAA Aviation Museum]] at [[Wittman Regional Airport]] in Oshkosh, which officially opened in 1983.&lt;ref name="a"/&gt;

In 1989 Poberezny was elected president of the [[Experimental Aircraft Association]].&lt;ref name=EAA2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eaa.org/news/2007/2007-05-21_tomp.asp|title=Tom Poberezny Named A 'Distinguished Wisconsin Aviator'|date=May 21, 2007|publisher=Experimental Aircraft Association|accessdate=2009-07-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202024004/http://www.eaa.org/news/2007/2007-05-21_tomp.asp|archivedate=December 2, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  EAA promotes the hobby of building and flying small aircraft and has over 180,000 members worldwide. In 1992 he led the creation of the [[Young Eagles]] program, which introduces young people to aviation. The goal of giving one million kids a ride in an aircraft was met in October 2003;&lt;ref name="a"/&gt; and in July 2016, the two millionth Young Eagle was flown by actor and former chairman of the organization, [[Harrison Ford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Harrison Ford Flies 2 Millionth Young Eagle|url=http://www.eaa.org/en/airventure/eaa-airventure-news-and-multimedia/eaa-airventure-news/eaa-airventure-oshkosh/07-27-2016-2-millionth-young-eagle-flies-today|accessdate= 25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Poberezny was a member of the [[Centennial of Flight Commission]],&lt;ref name="d"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centennialofflight.net/|title=U.S. Centennial of Flight Home Page|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a six-person board created by Congress in 1999 to coordinate the nation's celebration of the 100th anniversary of the [[Wright brothers]]' 1903 historic first flight.&lt;ref name="b"/&gt;

Poberezny has also promoted the EAA's role in the [[light-sport aircraft]] category, bringing new opportunities for people to learn to fly or keep flying.&lt;ref name=LivingLegend&gt;[http://spirit.eaa.org/news/2013/2013-01-23_tom-poberezny-named-living-legend.asp] EAA News (23 January 2013), ''Tom Poberezny Named A Living Legend''&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2009, Paul Poberezny stepped down as chairman of EAA and Tom Poberezny took on these duties as well, with Rod Hightower as president and CEO from September 7, 2010. Tom Poberezny retained the positions of chairman of both EAA and AirVenture.&lt;ref name=EAA1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eaa.org/news/2009/2009-03-04_poberezny.asp|title=EAA Names Tom Poberezny Chairman|date=March 4, 2009|publisher=Experimental Aircraft Association|accessdate=July 9, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309035118/http://www.eaa.org/news/2009/2009-03-04_poberezny.asp|archivedate=March 9, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 26, 2011, Poberezny and the EAA announced that he would be retiring from EAA effective August 1, 2011. The president and CEO, Rod Hightower, would assume Poberezny's duties until a replacement was found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aopa.org/oshkosh/2011/news/110726tom-poberezny-retires-as-eaa-chairman.html|title=Tom Poberezny retires as EAA chairman|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on 22 October 2012, Hightower resigned as president and CEO of EAA, and on the same day, [[Jack J. Pelton]] was elected chairman of the EAA board of directors. He issued a press announcement saying that he would assume all leadership duties of the organization until suitable replacements could be named.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flyingmag.com/news/hightower-out-eaa-pelton-new-chairman] Flying Magazine (22 October 2012), ''Hightower Out, Pelton is new EAA Chairman''&lt;/ref&gt;

Poberezny currently serves on the boards of several aviation organizations, including the Board of Directors for [[Garmin International]] and the Advisory Boards of [[Aircraft Kit Industry Association]] (AKIA), [[Cirrus Aircraft]], Citation Jet Pilots Association, and Angel Flight West.&lt;ref name="NAHF bio"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.garmin.com/en-US/company/leadership/thomas-poberezny/|title=Thomas P. Poberezny|publisher=Garmin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.akia.aero/?page_id=35|title=Advisory Board|publisher=AKIA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition==

Poberezny was inducted into the Wisconsin Aviation Hall of Fame in October 1996.&lt;ref name="b"/&gt; He was also awarded the Distinguished Wisconsin Aviator Award in May 2007. Past recipients of this award include astronaut [[Mark C. Lee]], Major General [[Albert Wilkening]], Major General [[Fred R. Sloan]], and astronaut [[Jim Lovell]].&lt;ref name=EAA2/&gt;

In early 2013, Poberezny received the prestigious [[Living Legends of Aviation|Living Legend of Aviation]] award at a ceremony in [[Beverly Hills, California]].&lt;ref name=LivingLegend/&gt; Later that year, a campaign and website was launched dedicated to honoring Poberezny and his accomplishments during the 20 years he led EAA. The website also included a Roster of Support for others to add to the cause. Notable proponents behind the effort consisted of [[aerospace engineer]] [[Burt Rutan]], [[Cirrus Aircraft]] CEO and Co-founder [[Klapmeier brothers|Dale Klapmeier]], and retired [[test pilot|test]], [[fighter pilot|fighter]] and [[air show]] pilot [[Bob Hoover]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://generalaviationnews.com/2013/10/15/honorpoberezny-com-launches/|title=HonorPoberezny.com launches|author=General Aviation News Staff|work=General Aviation News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flyingmag.com/pilots-places/pilots-adventures-more/petition-urges-eaa-honor-tom-poberezny|title=Petition Urges EAA to Honor Tom Poberezny|author= Pia Bergqvist|work=Flying Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;
