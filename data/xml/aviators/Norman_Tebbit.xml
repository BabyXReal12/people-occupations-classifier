{{Thatcherism|people}}
'''Norman Beresford Tebbit, Baron Tebbit''', {{postnominals|country=GBR|size=100%|sep=,|CH|PC}} (born 29 March 1931)&lt;ref name="Whoswho"/&gt; is a British politician and [[life peer]]. A member of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], he served in the Cabinet from 1981 to 1987 as [[Secretary of State for Employment]] (1981–83), [[Secretary of State for Trade and Industry]] (1983–85), [[Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster]] (1985–87) and [[Chairman of the Conservative Party]] (1985–87). He was a member of parliament (MP) from 1970 to 1992, representing the constituencies of [[Epping (UK Parliament constituency)|Epping]] (1970–74) and [[Chingford (UK Parliament constituency)|Chingford]] (1974–92).

In 1984, he was injured in the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]]'s [[Brighton hotel bombing|bombing]] of the [[Grand Hotel (Brighton)|Grand Hotel in Brighton]], where he was staying during the Conservative Party Conference. His wife [[Margaret Tebbit|Margaret]] was left permanently disabled after the explosion.&lt;ref&gt;''The Independent'' Tebbit interview with [[Deborah Ross (journalist)|Deborah Ross]] 3 October 2009: [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/norman-tebbit-margaret-and-i-both-made-the-same-mistake-we-neglected-to-clone-ourselves-1796187.html "Norman Tebbit: 'Margaret and I both made the same mistake. We neglected to clone ourselves'"]&lt;/ref&gt; He left the cabinet after the [[United Kingdom general election, 1987|1987 general election]] to care for his wife.&lt;ref name="Tebbit, p. 332"&gt;Tebbit, p. 332.&lt;/ref&gt; He considered standing for the Conservative leadership after [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s resignation in 1990, but came to the decision not to stand as he had earlier made a commitment to his wife to retire from front-line politics.&lt;ref name="newstatesman1"&gt;[http://www.newstatesman.com/200006050013 New Statesman – The New Statesman Interview – Norman Tebbit] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123122906/http://www.newstatesman.com/200006050013 |date=23 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He retired from parliament for Chingford in 1992, and has since sat in the [[House of Lords]] as '''Baron Tebbit''', of [[Chingford]].

==Early life and career before politics==

Born in [[Ponders End]], [[Middlesex]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Kavanagh  | first=Dennis  | title=A Dictionary of political biography | location=Oxford | publisher=Penguin  | year=1998 | isbn=0-19-280035-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; to working class parents,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/person/mp06507/norman-tebbit-baron-tebbit|title=Norman Tebbit, Baron Tebbit|author=|date=|work=npg.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tebbit went to [[Edmonton County School|Edmonton County Grammar School]],&lt;ref name="Whoswho"/&gt; which was then an academically selective [[state school]] in north London.

Tebbit worked as a journalist for the ''[[Financial Times]]'' before serving with the [[Royal Air Force]], during which time he flew [[Gloster Meteor|Meteor]] and [[De Havilland Vampire|Vampire]] jets. In July 1954, at [[RAF Waterbeach]] near [[Cambridge]], he had to break open the cockpit canopy of a burning Meteor 8 aircraft to escape from it, unknowingly fracturing two vertebrae in the accident.&lt;ref name="FlyPast"&gt;''[http://www.flypast.com/ FlyPast]'' (Key Publishing) magazine interview (in May 2014) with Norman Wells, October 2014 edition&lt;/ref&gt;

On leaving the RAF, he joined [[BOAC]] in 1953 as a navigator and pilot, while initially continuing to fly in the Royal Auxiliary Air Force with [[No. 604 Squadron RAF|604 (County of Middlesex) Squadron]] at [[RAF North Weald|North Weald]] in Essex.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Tebbit, Upwardly Mobile&lt;/ref&gt; Of his airline navigation training, he later said: "In those days it was a considerable academic syllabus. You had to be up to speed on [[spherical trigonometry]] to get through it".&lt;ref name="FlyPast"/&gt;

During his time at BOAC, he was an official in the [[British Air Line Pilots' Association]]. He flew [[Avro York]]s, [[Canadair North Star|Argonauts]], [[Bristol Britannia|Britannias]], [[DC7]]Cs and the [[Boeing 707]].

==Member of Parliament==
He was elected as MP for [[Epping (UK Parliament constituency)|Epping]] in [[United Kingdom general election, 1970|1970]] and then for [[Chingford (UK Parliament constituency)|Chingford]] in [[United Kingdom general election, February 1974|February 1974]]. He is recorded as an MP member of the [[Conservative Monday Club]] in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Copping, Robert, ''The Story of The Monday Club – The First Decade'', London, April 1972: 21&lt;/ref&gt;

Tebbit's first intervention as a MP was to ask a question of the then Minister at the [[Board of Trade]], [[Frederick Corfield]] on 6 July 1970. His question was on the subject of a [[1970 Dan-Air de Havilland Comet crash|crash of a Comet-4 aircraft in Spain]] on 3 July, which killed all the 112 people on board at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1970/jul/06/aircraft-accident-spain#S5CV0803P0_19700706_HOC_257 |title=AIRCRAFT ACCIDENT (SPAIN) (Hansard, 6 July 1970) |work=Hansard |accessdate=9 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, six men (the 'Ferrybridge Six') were dismissed from their jobs because of the introduction of a [[closed shop]] and were denied [[unemployment benefit]]. The [[Secretary of State for Employment]], [[Michael Foot]], commented: "A person who declines to fall in with new conditions of employment which result from a collective agreement may well be considered to have brought about his own dismissal". Tebbit accused Foot of "pure undiluted [[fascism]]” and affirmed that this “left Mr. Foot exposed as a bitter opponent of [[Freedom (political)|freedom]] and [[liberty]]".&lt;ref&gt;Norman Tebbit, ''Upwardly Mobile'' (Futura, 1991), p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; The next day (2 December) ''The Times'' first leader —titled "&lt;small&gt;IS MR. FOOT A FASCIST?&lt;/small&gt;"—quoted Tebbit and went on:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Mr. Foot's doctrine is intolerable because it is a violation of the liberty of the ordinary man in his job. Mr. Tebbit is therefore using fascism in a legitimate descriptive sense when he accuses Mr. Foot of it. We perhaps need to revive the phrase "[[social fascism]]" to describe the modern British development of the corporate state and its bureaucratic attack on personal liberty. The question is not therefore: "is Mr. Foot a fascist?" but "does Mr. Foot know he is a fascist?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Is Mr Foot a Fascist? |work=The Times |location=UK |page=13 |date=2 December 1975 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During the [[Grunwick dispute]], in which went on strike over pay, working conditions and the owner George Ward refused to recognise their trade union, there was a split in the Conservative Shadow Cabinet between the conciliatory approach of [[Jim Prior]], the Shadow Employment Secretary, and [[Keith Joseph]]. Tebbit involved himself in that dispute by making a controversial speech on 12 September 1977, in which he said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Inside Britain there is a ... threat from the Marxist collectivist totalitarians. ... Just to state that fact is to be accused of 'union-bashing'. ... Such people are to be found in the Conservative, Liberal and Labour Parties. Their politics may be different but such people share the morality of [[Pierre Laval|Laval]] and [[Philippe Pétain|Pétain]] ... they are willing not only to tolerate evil, but to excuse it. ... Both Jim Prior and Keith Joseph know that George Ward and Grunwick are not perfect, nor was Czechoslovakia perfect in 1938. But if Ward and Grunwick are destroyed by the red fascists, then, as in 1938, we will have to ask, whose turn is it next? Yes, it is like 1938. We can all see the evil, but the doctrine of appeasement is still to be heard.&lt;ref&gt;Tebbit, pp. 194–5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Tebbit was accused of comparing Prior to Laval and at that year's Conservative Party conference. Tebbit attempted to avoid personalising the issue, and openly splitting the party, without retracting what he had said. Tebbit said of these differences: "I'm a hawk—but no kamikaze. And Jim's a dove—but he's not chicken".&lt;ref&gt;Tebbit, p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt;

During a debate in Parliament on 2 March 1978, [[Michael Foot]] labelled Tebbit a "semi-house-trained [[wikt:polecat|polecat]]" in response to a question from Tebbit asking if he accepted that the legislation being proposed that made it compulsory for people to join a Trade Union was an act of Fascism. When he was made Lord Tebbit in 1992, he chose a polecat as one of the symbols on his coat of arms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/normantebbit/100028735/michael-foots-polecat-jibe-demeaned-him-but-boosted-my-career/ |location=London |title=Michael Foot's 'polecat' jibe demeaned him but boosted my career |date=7 March 2010 |work=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in the debate Tebbit asked Foot whether he would "put a bridle on his foul-mouthed tongue".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.margaretthatcher.org/speeches/displaydocument.asp?docid=103629 |title=HC PQ Business of the House, &amp;#124; Margaret Thatcher Foundation |publisher=Margaretthatcher.org |date= |accessdate=17 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1979 government===
After the Conservative Party regained power after the [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|general election of 1979]], Tebbit was appointed Under-Secretary at the Ministry of Trade.

In the [[First Thatcher ministry#September 1981 to June 1983|September 1981 Cabinet reshuffle]], Thatcher appointed Tebbit as [[Secretary of State for Employment|Employment Secretary]]. This was seen as a shift to a 'tougher' approach to the trade unions than had been the case under Tebbit's predecessor, [[Jim Prior|James Prior]]. Tebbit introduced the [[Employment Act 1982]] which raised the level of compensation for those unfairly dismissed from a closed shop and prohibited closed shops unless 80% of relevant workers approved the arrangement in periodic ballots. It also removed trade unions' immunity from liability in tort- i.e. made trade unions liable for civil damages if they committed unlawful acts, and made injunctions possible against such acts. In his memoirs Tebbit said that the 1982 Act was his "greatest achievement in Government".&lt;ref&gt;Tebbit, p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of the 1981 riots in [[1981 Handsworth riots|Handsworth]] and [[1981 Brixton riot|Brixton]], Tebbit responded to a suggestion by the [[Young Conservatives (UK)|Young Conservative]] National Chairman, [[Iain Picton (politician)|Iain Picton]] that rioting was the natural reaction to unemployment:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I grew up in the '30s with an unemployed father. He didn't riot. He got on his bike and looked for work, and he kept looking till he found it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As a result, Tebbit is often misquoted as having directly told the unemployed to "get on your bike", and he was popularly referred to as 'Onyerbike' for some considerable time afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2775293/On-yer-bike-Olympic-cycling-ace-Victoria-Pendelton-echoes-Tebbit-Tory-conference-plea-fit-job.html|title=On yer bike! Olympic cycling ace Victoria Pendleton echoes Tebbit with Tory conference plea to 'get fit to get a job'|author=|date=|work=Mail Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The former Conservative Prime Minister [[Harold Macmillan]] once remarked of Tebbit: "Heard a chap on the radio this morning talking with a cockney accent. They tell me he is one of Her Majesty's ministers".&lt;ref&gt;Chris Moncrieff,[https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/may/10/redbox.houseofcommons 'When Labour MPs wore miners' helmets'], ''The Guardian'', 10 May 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Don Grant, 'CLUBBING: [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4159/is_20031026/ai_n12749113 Pratts? If you say so, sir']{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''The Independent on Sunday'', 26 October 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Dorey of [[Cardiff University]] wrote that "it was Norman Tebbit... who was perhaps the public face or voice of [[Essex Man]], and articulated his views and prejudices".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uc.edu/bpg/bpg120pagemaker.pdf |title=British Politics Group Newsletter, Spring 2005 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=17 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1983 government===
The [[Nuffield College, Oxford|Nuffield]] study of the [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|1983 general election]] found that Tebbit was the second most prominent Conservative on radio and television news broadcasts during the campaign with 81 appearances (after Thatcher's 331 appearances).&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the post-election [[Second Thatcher ministry#Changes|October 1983 reshuffle]], Tebbit was moved from Employment to become [[Secretary of State for Trade and Industry|Trade and Industry Secretary]] to replace [[Cecil Parkinson]], who had resigned. Thatcher had actually wanted Tebbit to become [[Home Secretary]] but [[William Whitelaw]] vetoed this.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, pp. 205–206.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tebbit was injured in the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]]'s [[Brighton hotel bombing|bombing of the Grand Hotel, Brighton]] during the 1984 Conservative Party conference (he still has a slight limp, but was largely protected by a mattress falling on him).&lt;ref&gt;''The Independent'', Tebbit interview with Deborah Ross 3 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt; His wife, [[Margaret Tebbit|Margaret]], was permanently disabled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/terrorism-in-the-uk/6622798/Lord-Tebbits-wife-Margaret-Norman-and-I-dont-have-time-to-cry.html|title=Lord Tebbit's wife Margaret: Norman and I don't have time to cry|last=Correspondent|first=By Laura Donnelly, Health|work=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=1 August 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, Tebbit was appointed [[Chairman of the Conservative Party]] and [[Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster]], as Thatcher wanted to keep him in the Cabinet. During the [[Westland affair]] Tebbit was against the [[Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation]] taking over [[Westland Aircraft]]. In 1986, Tebbit opposed the American bombing raid on [[Libya]] from British bases and objected to Thatcher's refusal to consult the Cabinet fully on the matter. However, he did criticise the [[BBC]] for its supposedly biased reporting of the raid. During the same year, he disbanded the [[Federation of Conservative Students]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.socialaffairsunit.org.uk/blog/archives/001216.php|title=FCS twenty years on – Harry Phibbs remembers his days in the Federation of Conservative Students|last1=Phibbs|first1=Harry|date=30 October 2006 |publisher=The Social Affairs Unit|accessdate=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; for publishing an article, penned by Harry Phibbs, following [[Nikolai Tolstoy]]'s accusation that former Conservative Prime Minister [[Harold Macmillan]] was complicit in the forced repatriation of [[Cossacks]] in the aftermath of the [[Second World War]].

On 13 April 1986, Tebbit and his chief of staff [[Michael Dobbs]] visited Thatcher at [[Chequers]] to present her with the results of polling by [[Saatchi and Saatchi]] which found that with inflation down and the trade unions weakened, "the Prime Minister's combative virtues were being received as vices: her determination was perceived as stubbornness, her single-mindedness as inflexibility, and her strong will as an inability to listen".&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, p. 499.&lt;/ref&gt; Tebbit and Dobbs told her this was becoming known as the "TBW factor": TBW standing for "That Bloody Woman". They recommended Thatcher take a lower profile in the forthcoming general election.

A few weeks later, Tebbit gave an interview to [[John Mortimer]] for ''[[The Spectator]]'' where he said of Thatcher: &lt;blockquote&gt;It's a question of her leadership when our aims aren't clearly defined. When people understand what she's doing there's a good deal of admiration for her energy and resolution and persistence, even from those people who don't agree with her. Now there's a perception that we don't know where we're going so those same qualities don't seem so attractive.&lt;ref name="Campbell500"&gt;Campbell, p. 500.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;Thatcher disagreed and her biographer claims she was suspicious of Tebbit's motives. Furthermore, Thatcher commissioned the firm [[Young and Rubicam]] to carry out their own polling, which concluded that Thatcher's leadership was not the problem. Throughout the rest of 1986 and into the 1987 election, Thatcher continued to use Young and Rubicam, which eventually caused tensions with Tebbit during the election campaign.&lt;ref name="Campbell500" /&gt;

For quite a while Tebbit was seen as Thatcher's natural successor as Party leader. During early 1986, when Thatcher's popularity declined in the polls, commentators began to suggest that the succession of the Conservative leadership would lie between [[Michael Heseltine]] and Tebbit.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, p. 498.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 1986 Conservative Party Conference in [[Bournemouth]], Tebbit—along with Saatchi and Saatchi, Dobbs and the Conservatives' Director of Research, [[Robin Harris (author)|Robin Harris]]—came up with the next party slogan—'The Next Move Forward'. The Conservatives for the first time employed pre-conference advertising to publicise the new-style conference. Tebbit persuaded Thatcher that ministers would state their objectives that they would achieve in the next three years; Saatchi &amp; Saatchi would use these to design posters, leaflets, and brochures to be deployed as each minister finished their speech. The aim "was that in 1986 the media should reflect the image I wanted—of a Government confident, united, clear in where it was going—and determined to get there".&lt;ref&gt;Tebbit, p. 319.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Tebbit the conference "was more successful than I had dared to hope ... the opinion polls which had us 7% behind in June and still 5% down in September now put us back into first place—a position we never relinquished from then right through the election campaign. The Prime Minister's ratings were immediately restored".&lt;ref&gt;Tebbit, p. 320.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[MORI]] opinion poll in March 1987 saw Tebbit as second-favourite amongst voters as Thatcher's successor (Heseltine: 24% vs Tebbit: 15%); however, amongst Conservative voters, Tebbit was the front-runner with (Heseltine: 14% vs Tebbit: 21%).&lt;ref&gt;Watkins, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1988 MORI asked the same question, with similar results (Heseltine: 22% vs Tebbit: 15%) and (Heseltine: 20% vs Tebbit: 26%) amongst Conservative voters.&lt;ref&gt;Watkins, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; However Thatcher apparently once told [[Rupert Murdoch]]: "I couldn't get him elected as leader of the Tory party even if I wanted – nor would the country elect him if he was".&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Neil, ''Full Disclosure'' (Macmillan, 1996), p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 January 1987, the journalist [[Hugo Young]] published a quote attributed to Tebbit in ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper. Tebbit's chief of staff, [[Michael Dobbs]], responded by writing a letter to the newspaper citing Young's dislike of Tebbit, adding "Perhaps this explains the invention of the quotation he [Mr Young] attributed to Mr Tebbit". The quote was "No-one with a conscience votes Conservative". Before this letter was published, however, the words "the invention of" had been removed. Despite publishing this letter ''The Guardian'' subsequently repeated the quote, and Young again attributed it to him in a letter to ''[[The Spectator]]''. Tebbit feared that if no action was taken against ''The Guardian'' the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] would use this quote against the Conservatives in the forthcoming general election. With Thatcher's consent Tebbit threatened the newspaper with legal action if they did not retract the quotation and apologise to Tebbit. The case continued until 1988 when ''The Guardian'' apologised, published a retraction and paid £14,000 in libel [[damages]] in an out-of-court settlement.&lt;ref&gt;Tebbit, p. 328.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[United Kingdom general election, 1987|1987 general election]], Tebbit and Saatchi &amp; Saatchi spearheaded the Conservative campaign, focusing on the economy and defence. However, when on 'Wobbly Thursday' it was rumoured a Marplan opinion poll showed a 2% Conservative lead, the 'exiles' camp of [[David Young, Baron Young of Graffham|David Young]], [[Tim Bell]] and the Young and Rubicam firm advocated a more aggressively anti-Labour message. This was when, according to Young's memoirs, Young got Tebbit by the lapels and shook him, shouting: "Norman, listen to me, we're about to lose this fucking election".&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, p. 522.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/the-week/13411/has-gordon-brown-delivered-his-last-budget-the-truth-is-that-blair-hasnt-yet-decided/ |title=Has Gordon Brown delivered his last Budget? The truth is that Blair hasn't yet decided |date=19 March 2005 |work=The Spectator |first=Peter |last=Oborne }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his memoirs Tebbit defends the Conservative campaign: "We finished exactly as planned on the ground where Labour was weak and we were strong—defence, taxation, and the economy".&lt;ref&gt;Tebbit, p. 336.&lt;/ref&gt; During the election campaign however Tebbit and Thatcher argued.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Thatcher, ''The Downing Street Years'' (HarperCollins, 1993), p. 584.&lt;/ref&gt; Tebbit had already informed Thatcher at the beginning of the campaign that he would leave the government after the election to care for his wife.&lt;ref name="Tebbit, p. 332" /&gt;

Thatcher said to her friend [[Woodrow Wyatt]] on the Sunday after polling day in 1987: "He'll carry the scar of that Brighton bombing all his life. I didn't want him to go. Whenever he is away from her he can't even attend to business properly. He's always ringing up to find out if the nurses are looking after his wife all right".&lt;ref&gt;Woodrow Wyatt, ''The Journals of Woodrow Wyatt. Volume One'' (Pan, 1999), p. 371.&lt;/ref&gt; In her memoirs, Thatcher said she "bitterly regretted" losing a like-minded person from the Cabinet.&lt;ref&gt;Thatcher, p. 587.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 July 1987, Tebbit was appointed to the [[Order of the Companions of Honour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=51014 |date=31 July 1987 |page=2 |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Backbenches===
As Trade and Industry Secretary, Tebbit had privatised British Telecom in November 1984. He became a director of the company on 3 November 1987; this gave him an additional salary plus shares in the company.

In late 1987 and 1988, Tebbit formed a temporary alliance with [[Michael Heseltine]] in campaigning for the abolition of the [[Inner London Education Authority]], which they succeeded in achieving through a backbench amendment.&lt;ref&gt;Watkins, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tebbit was also prominent in an unsuccessful Conservative backbench rebellion against a Bill to give 50,000 households (around 250,000 people) from Hong Kong [[British Nationality (Hong Kong) Act 1990|British citizenship]].&lt;ref&gt;Whitney, Craig R., 10 January 1990.

In April 1988, Tebbit caused much controversy when, in front of an audience of South African dignitaries, he accused critics of South African apartheid of cowardice and stinking hypocrisy. He said that, although black critics attacked apartheid in South Africa, they did not speak out against violence among black tribes in South Africa. Archbishop [[Desmond Tutu]] was visiting London at the time and called on Thatcher to repudiate the remarks; instead she defended Tebbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=jVgVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=1OQDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5109,5357391&amp;dq=norman+tebbit&amp;hl=en |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |title=Row over Tory Chief's Support |date=22 April 1988 |accessdate=17 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1990, he proposed the "[[Cricket test]]", also known as the "Tebbit Test", when he argued that whether people from [[ethnic minority|ethnic minorities]] in Britain supported the England cricket team (rather than the team from their country of ancestry) should be considered a barometer—but not the sole indicator—of whether they are truly British: "A large proportion of Britain's Asian population fail to pass the cricket test. Which side do they cheer for? It's an interesting test. Are you still harking back to where you came from or where you are?"&lt;ref&gt;John Carvel, [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/jan/08/britishidentity.race 'Tebbit's cricket loyalty test hit for six'], ''The Guardian'', 8 January 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tebbit told Woodrow Wyatt in 1991 that he did not think certain immigrant communities would assimilate "because some of them insist on sticking to their own culture, like the Muslims in Bradford and so forth, and they are extremely dangerous".&lt;ref&gt;Woodrow Wyatt, ''The Journals of Woodrow Wyatt. Volume Two'' (Pan, 2000), p. 530.&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2005, after the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]], which were carried out by three young men of Pakistani descent and one of Jamaican descent, Tebbit claimed vindication for these views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epolitix.com/EN/News/200508/072d2cc0-3f3a-494f-8590-3e51127e853b.htm |title='Tebbit: 'Cricket test' could have stopped bombings' |publisher=Epolitix.com |date= |accessdate=17 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a conversation with Woodrow Wyatt on 19 December 1988, Tebbit said he would not go back into politics unless Thatcher "was run over by the proverbial bus and he didn't like the look of the person he thought might get her job and destroy the work they've done".&lt;ref&gt;Wyatt, ''Volume One'', p. 692.&lt;/ref&gt; On another occasion (22 February 1990), Tebbit said to Wyatt that he would stand for the Conservative leadership if Thatcher suddenly resigned; but when [[Alec Douglas-Home]] suggested that Thatcher would not stand at the next election because she must be tired, Tebbit disagreed: "She has got amazing stamina".&lt;ref&gt;Wyatt, ''Volume Two'', pp. 244–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Geoffrey Howe]]'s resignation from the government in November 1990, Thatcher asked Tebbit to return to the Cabinet as [[Secretary of State for Education and Skills|Education Secretary]], but he refused on the grounds that he was looking after his wife.&lt;ref&gt;Thatcher, p. 835.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Conservative Party (UK) leadership election, 1990|1990 Conservative Party leadership election]], Tebbit was on Thatcher's campaign team with the job of assessing her support amongst Conservative MPs.&lt;ref&gt;Thatcher, p. 846.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Thatcher's biographer [[John Campbell (biographer)|John Campbell]], Tebbit was "her most visible cheerleader...who characteristically took the fight to Heseltine by holding a cheeky press conference on his Belgravia doorstep".&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, p. 724.&lt;/ref&gt; After the first ballot but before the results became known, Tebbit wanted Thatcher to make a clear commitment to fight the second ballot if her vote fell short of the amount needed to win outright.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, p. 731.&lt;/ref&gt; When Tebbit saw Thatcher on 21 November he told her she was the candidate with the best chance of beating Heseltine.&lt;ref&gt;Thatcher, p. 847.&lt;/ref&gt; However Thatcher withdrew from the contest the next day. Tebbit wanted to stand, but never did. Tebbit then switched his support to [[John Major]].&lt;ref&gt;Watkins, p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Major came back from Maastricht with an opt-out from the Social Chapter and the single currency, Tebbit was one of the few MPs in the debate on 18 December 1991 to criticise the new powers the Community would acquire. He claimed the government had been on the defensive against "federalist follies" and that Maastricht had seen "a series of bridgeheads into our constitution, into the powers of this House, and into the lives of individuals and businesses".&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Booker and Richard North, ''The Great Deception. A Secret History of the European Union'' (Continuum, 2003), p. 276.&lt;/ref&gt;

==After leaving the House of Commons==
Tebbit decided not to stand in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1992|1992 election]], to devote more time to caring for his disabled wife. After the election he was granted a [[life peerage]] and entered the [[House of Lords]], having been created '''Baron Tebbit''', of [[Chingford]] in the [[London Borough of Waltham Forest]] on 6 July 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=52986 |date=9 July 1992 |page=11599}}&lt;/ref&gt; His former seat of Chingford was aggregated in 1997 with [[Woodford Green]] in boundary changes and was held for the Conservative Party by his successor and protégé [[Iain Duncan Smith]]. Tebbit famously said: "If you think I'm right-wing, you should meet this guy".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/2152093.stm |publisher=BBC News  | title=Thursday 25&amp;nbsp;July | date=25 July 2002 | accessdate=20 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maastricht Treaty and Europe===

{{Main|Maastricht Treaty}}

On 11 August 1992, Woodrow Wyatt noted in his diary: "[Thatcher] also seems to have formed a new alliance with Tebbit who stirs her up and talks a lot of nonsense [about the Treaty]."&lt;ref&gt;Woodrow Wyatt, ''The Journals of Woodrow Wyatt. Volume Three'' (Pan, 2001), p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the October 1992 Conservative Party Conference in Brighton, Tebbit embarrassed [[John Major]]'s government when he made a speech attacking the Treaty. As he walked up onto the podium he was applauded by some sections of the audience, described as "young, in t-shirts, aggressively self-confident – the lager louts of our party" in the diary of the Conservative Party chairman of the time, [[Norman Fowler, Baron Fowler|Norman Fowler]].&lt;ref&gt;Norman Fowler, ''A Political Suicide'' (Politico's, 2008), p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; Tebbit held aloft a copy of the Treaty and asked the conference a series of questions about the Treaty: did they want to see a single currency or be citizens of a European Union? The audience shouted back "No!" after each question. Tebbit received a tumultuous standing ovation and walked into the centre of the conference hall waving amongst the cheers. [[Gyles Brandreth]], a Conservative whip, wrote in his diary:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The talk of the town is Norman Tebbit's vulgar grand-standing barn-storming performance on Europe. He savaged Maastricht, poured scorn on monetary union, patronised the PM...and brought the conference (or a good part of it) to its feet roaring for more. He stood there, arms aloft, acknowledging the ovation, Norman the conqueror.&lt;ref&gt;Gyles Brandreth, ''Breaking the Code: Westminster Diaries, 1992–97'' (Phoenix, 2000), p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his memoirs, Major accused Tebbit of hypocrisy and disloyalty because Tebbit had encouraged Conservative MPs to vote for the [[Single European Act]] in 1986 but was now campaigning for Maastricht's rejection.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Major]], ''The Autobiography'' (HarperCollins, 2000), p. 861.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2007, Tebbit became patron of the cross-party [[Better Off Out]] campaign, which advocates British withdrawal from the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6511701.stm |publisher=BBC News  | title=Tebbit supports EU exit campaign | date=30 March 2007 | accessdate=20 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tebbit issued a statement explaining his support:

&lt;blockquote&gt;From being a supporter of British membership of the Common Market in 1970 I have come to believe that the United Kingdom would be Better Off Out of the developing European Republic of the 21st century. We British have a thousand year history of self-government. We have been free and democratic longer than any other nation. The European Union is too diverse, too bureaucratic, too corporatist and too centralist to be a functioning democracy. We are happy to trade with our European friends and the rest of the world – but we would prefer to govern ourselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.betteroffout.net/supporters/ |title=Better Off Out – Supporters |publisher=Better Off Out |accessdate=9 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Involvement with the Conservative Party after 1992===

Tebbit privately said of [[John Major]] on 17 November 1994: "He has the mulishness of a weak man with stupidity". When asked what would it take for him to support Major, Tebbit responded: "Have an entirely new department, the sole job of which would be to deal with the Brussels machinery in every aspect. I agree that we don't want to leave the EU, but we've got to manipulate it and block every single advance we don't like. No, no, no must be his weapon. Veto everything he disapproves of or that we disapprove of".&lt;ref&gt;Wyatt, ''Volume Three'', pp. 437–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, Tebbit publicly backed [[John Redwood]]'s [[Conservative Party (UK) leadership election, 1995|bid for the Conservative Party leadership]], praising his "brains, courage and humour".

In an interview for the ''[[New Statesman]]'' magazine in June 2000, Tebbit praised Hague's right-ward shift and revealed that he had "never been a [Michael] Portillo fan". He also mused on not standing for the Conservative leadership after Thatcher's resignation: "When I look at what happened to the party, I tell myself that perhaps I failed in a duty. I suppose I am one of those who have it on my conscience that I allowed Mr Blair to become Prime Minister". When asked if he regretted also allowing Major to become Prime Minister, Tebbit responded:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I helped him. If I'd opposed him, he wouldn't have been on the radar screen. I'd have been opposing Michael Heseltine. I had to make the decision quickly. I didn't want to go back on my word to my wife that I'd retired from front-line politics. How would it all work? Was No 10 suitable for someone in a wheelchair? All these things go through one's mind. Then if Michael had won...he would have had to ask me to join his government, and I didn't want that. I asked myself: why am I risking all this? And I made my decision...I might have been an absolute disaster in the job. It's possible. So I am left there. You can't rewrite it. You can't rerun it.&lt;ref name="newstatesman1"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In August 2002, Tebbit called on the then leader of the Conservatives, [[Iain Duncan Smith]], to "clear out" Conservative Central Office of "squabbling children" who were involved with infighting within the Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/3580542/IDS-must-sack-the-squabbling-children.html|last= Tebbit |first= Norman |date= 18 August 2002 |work= The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=18 May 2013 |location=London |title=IDS must sack the squabbling children}}&lt;/ref&gt; He named [[Mark MacGregor]], a former leader of the [[Federation of Conservative Students]] which Tebbit disbanded for "loony Right libertarian politics", as one of them. Then in October the same year Tebbit accused a group of Conservative "modernisers" called "The Movement" of trying to get him expelled from the Party. Tebbit said that The Movement consisted of a "loose" grouping of thirteen members who had previously supported [[Kenneth Clarke]] and [[Michael Portillo]] for Party leader. Duncan Smith subsequently denied that Tebbit would ever be expelled and Thatcher publicly said she was "appalled" at attempts to have Tebbit expelled and telephoned him to say that she was "four square behind him".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-26276393_ITM | work=Europe Intelligence Wire | title=Thatcher 'appalled' by attacks on Tebbit | date=12 October 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2003, Tebbit gave a speech to an audience of the [[Chartered Institute of Journalists]] at London's [[Reform Club]] in [[Pall Mall, London|Pall Mall]], urged journalists to reject [[political correctness]] in favour of "open, honest and vigorous debate". He blamed "timid" politicians, including members of his own party, for allowing PC language and ideas to take hold in Britain by default.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Press Gazette]]'', London, 21 February 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tebbit backed [[David Davis (British politician)|David Davis]] for Party leader during the [[Conservative Party (UK) leadership election, 2005|2005 Conservative leadership election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/politics/article2027373.ece|title= Davis wins Tebbit's backing|last1= Bennett|first1= Rosemary |date= 8 November 2005 |work=The Times |accessdate=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 January 2006, he accused the Conservative Party of abandoning the party's true supporters on the Right, and opposed the new Leader [[David Cameron]]'s attempts "to reposition the party on the 'Left of the middle ground'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1509210/Dont-be-fooled-by-Cameron-Tebbit-to-warn-Right.html |title=Don't be fooled by Cameron, Tebbit to warn Right |last1= Helm |first1= Toby |last2=Rennie |first2=David |date=30 January 2006 |work= The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=18 May 2013 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with ''[[The Times]]'' in September 2007, Tebbit said the Conservatives lack somebody of the standing of Thatcher, and claimed that although it did not matter if Cameron's team were educated at Eton, "what a lot of people will suggest is that they don't know how the other half lives. David and his colleagues – the very clever young men they have in Central Office these days – are very intellectually clever, but they have no experience of the world whatsoever. He has spent much of his time in the Conservative Party and as a public relations guy. Well, it's not the experience of most people in the streets. That's the real attack and that's damaging to him, I think".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ginnydougary.co.uk/2007/09/29/the-torchbearer/ |title=Ginny Dougary, 'Norman Tebbit discusses Cameron, loss and multiculturalism'; The Times |publisher=Ginnydougary.co.uk |date=29 September 2007 |accessdate=17 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/politics/article2023900.ece |title=Tebbit hits out at Tories and names Brown as Thatcher's natural heir |last1=Webster |first1= Philip |date=26 September 2007 |publisher= thetimesonline.co.uk |work= The Times |accessdate=18 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Norman Tebbit Edinburgh University Politics Society 2008.JPG|thumb|upright|Tebbit giving a talk for the [[Edinburgh University]] Politics Society in 2008]]
In February 2008, after a magazine article written by shadow education secretary [[Michael Gove]], Tebbit publicly criticised what he characterised as "the poisonous tree of Blairism", which he claimed had been "planted" in the Conservative Party front bench.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Porter [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/conservative/1580149/Lord-Tebbit-warns-on-worship-of-Tony-Blair.html "Lord Tebbit warns on worship of Tony Blair",] ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 18 April 2008. Retrieved 8 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Tebbit is the vice-president of the [[Conservative Way Forward]] group.

Tebbit has continued his criticism of the Conservative Party's move to a more "centre-right" position by stating that their abandonment of the traditional right vote has created a political vacuum which has contributed to the rise of UKIP, including two MP defections both from the Conservatives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westernmorningnews.co.uk/Tebbit-Tories-struggle-election-unless-UKIP/story-25798093-detail/story.html "Lord Tebbit: Tories will struggle in election unless UKIP implode",] ''[[Western Morning News]]'', 2 January 2015.

===Other political views===

====Overseas aid====

Speaking in the Lords on 26 November 1996, Lord Tebbit attacked aid to Africa, saying that most aid sent to Africa goes down a "sink of iniquity, corruption and violence" and does little to help the poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199697/ldhansrd/vo961126/text/61126-03.htm|title=Lords Hansard text for 26 Nov 1996 (161126-03)|first=Department of the Official Report (Hansard), House of Lords,|last=Westminster|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A spokesman for the charity Oxfam said Tebbit's view was "simplistic and unhelpful". Later Lord Tebbit defended his statement that most money went "into the pockets" of politicians "to buy guns for warlords".&lt;ref&gt;''The Daily Telegraph'', 27 November 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

====Homosexuality====

In a letter to ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' in November 1998, Tebbit said homosexuals should be barred from being Home Secretary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html=/archive/1998/11/02/nteb02.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030523052202/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html=%2Farchive%2F1998%2F11%2F02%2Fnteb02.html |archivedate=23 May 2003 |first=George |last=Jones |title=Keep gays out of top Government jobs, says Tebbit |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=2 November 1998 |accessdate=5 October 2013 |location=London |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A Conservative Party spokesman said Tebbit was "out of touch" and the official spokesman for [[William Hague]], then Conservative Party leader, said Hague disagreed with Tebbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html=/archive/1998/11/03/nteb03.html=/archive/1998/11/02/nteb02.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030512012645/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html=%2Farchive%2F1998%2F11%2F03%2Fnteb03.html |archivedate=12 May 2003 |first=Robert |last=Shrimsley |title=Tory leaders reject Tebbit's views on gays |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=3 November 1999 |accessdate=5 October 2013 |location=London |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Tebbit wrote in his Telegraph blog in 2013: "Do I still hold that a homosexual should not be Home Secretary? It gets a straight answer. No, our openness about homosexuality has changed the circumstances and my view has now changed too".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/normantebbit/100217539/ignore-the-squeaks-from-the-timid-its-time-to-enact-the-referendum-bill/?ico=^editors_choice|title=Ignore the squeaks from the timid.

In 2004, he opposed the British Government's [[Civil Partnership Act 2004]]. In May 2013, Lord Tebbit said that the coalition government's determination to pass the [[Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill]] had alienated grassroots Tories. He also warned it might mean a lesbian queen could give birth to a future monarch by artificial insemination and said that the legislation could allow him to marry his son to escape [[Inheritance Tax (United Kingdom)|inheritance tax]].&lt;ref&gt;Burns, Andrew (20 May 2013) [http://www.bigissue.com/mix/news/2385/norman-tebbit-maybe-id-be-allowed-marry-my-son Norman Tebbit: "Maybe I'd be allowed to marry my son"] bigissue.com&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, Tebbit said that he would not attend services at [[St Edmundsbury Cathedral]] conducted by new dean [[Joe Hawes]], because of Hawes' civil partnership with another clergyman.  Tebbit described Hawes as a "sodomite".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New dean feels ‘no ill will’ towards Lord Tebbit following controversial ‘sodomite’ comment|url=http://www.eadt.co.uk/news/new-dean-feels-no-ill-will-towards-lord-tebbit-following-controversial-sodomite-comment-1-5517711|work=East Anglian Daily Times|date=14 May 2018|accessdate=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Northern Ireland====

In October 1999, he spoke out against the plans to abolish the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]]. Tebbit said he was against throwing the Constabulary's name and badge "into the modernisation trash can" and that the RUC had been "the thin green line standing between bloody anarchy and the rule of law". Tebbit also mocked Blair's pledge at the Labour conference to "set people free": "He has set them free. More than 250 terrorists, bombers and extortionists. Kneecappers, kidnappers, arsonists and killers have been set free. But their victims remain imprisoned. Some are imprisoned within broken bodies. Some imprisoned in grief for their loved ones. Some imprisoned by death in their graves".&lt;ref&gt;George Jones, Polly Newton Andrew Sparrow, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html=/archive/1999/10/06/ntory06.html 'Tebbit launches bitter attack on Patten's proposals for RUC'], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 6 October 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other parties====

In an article for ''The Spectator'' in May 2001 Tebbit claimed that retired British security service agents from the [[Foreign Office]] had infiltrated [[James Goldsmith]]'s [[Referendum Party]] in the 1990s and then later infiltrated [[United Kingdom Independence Party]] (UKIP). Tebbit called for an independent enquiry into the matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/26th-may-2001/16/ukip-is-there-a-hidden-agenda | title=UKIP: Is there a hidden agenda? | date=25 May 2001 | work=The Spectator | first=Norman | last=Tebbit }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/vote2001/hi/english/newsid_1348000/1348222.stm |publisher=BBC News  | title=Tebbit secret agent claim | date=23 May 2001 | accessdate=20 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpgb.org.uk/worker/386/mi6-ukip.html Weekly Worker 386 Thursday 31 May 2001] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213222839/http://www.cpgb.org.uk/worker/386/mi6-ukip.html |date=13 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Tebbit said he had regrets about the [[UK miners' strike (1984–85)|1984–1985 miners' strike]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Those mining communities had good working class values and a sense of family values. The men did real men's heavy work going down the pit. There were also some very close-knit communities which were able to deal with the few troublesome kids. If they had any problems they would take the kid round the back and give them a good clip round the ear and that would be the end of that. Many of these communities were completely devastated, with people out of work turning to drugs and no real man's work because all the jobs had gone. There is no doubt that this led to a breakdown in these communities with families breaking up and youths going out of control. The scale of the closures went too far. The damage done to those communities was enormous as a result of the strike.&lt;ref&gt;Francis Beckett and David Hencke, ''[https://books.google.co.uk/books?redir_esc=y&amp;id=552eBAAAQBAJ&amp;q=clip#v=snippet&amp;q=clip&amp;f=false Marching to the Fault Line. The Miners' Strike and the Battle for Industrial Britain]'' (Constable, 2009), pp. 261–262.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====National Health Service====

In 2011, Tebbit criticised the Conservative-led coalition government's proposed reforms to the [[National Health Service (England)|National Health Service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/the-staggers/2011/04/plans-owen-reforms-tebbit|title=Opposition to the coalition’s NHS reforms spreads|date=1 April 2011|work=New Statesman|accessdate=17 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Immigration====
In June 2014, in response to an [[Operation Trojan Horse|Islamist plot to infiltrate schools in Birmingham]], Tebbit wrote in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', "No one should have been surprised at what was going on in schools in Birmingham. It is precisely what I was talking about over 20 years ago and Enoch Powell was warning against long before that. We have imported far too many immigrants who have come here not to live in our society, but to replicate here the society of their homelands."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Tebbit, Norman|authorlink1=Norman Tebbit|title=Trojan Horse: I warned about this years ago|url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/normantebbit/100275737/trojan-horse-i-warned-about-this-years-ago/|accessdate=19 January 2015|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
===="Foreigners" speech====
In 2017, Lord Tebbit criticised a Lords amendment to [[European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill 2017|the Brexit bill]] which would guarantee the rights of EU citizens to live and work within the UK after [[Brexit]]. He also attacked the Lords for "thinking of nothing but the rights of foreigners" and "[looking] after the foreigners and not the British",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bienkov|first1=Adam|title=Lord Tebbit: 'We seem to be thinking of nothing but the rights of foreigners'|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/lord-tebbit-norman-rights-of-foreigners-eu-citizens-british-brexit-2017-3|accessdate=5 March 2017|work=Business Insider|date=1 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as [[Theresa May]] had hoped to leave this amendment out of the bill in order to secure the rights of British citizens living in EU countries post-Brexit. His comments produced "loud gasps" from the majority of peers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Merrick|first1=Rob|title=Lord Tebbit accuses peers trying to guarantee EU nationals' rights of 'thinking of nothing but the rights of foreigners'|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-bill-lord-tebbit-right-eu-nationals-foreigners-comments-a7606456.html|accessdate=5 March 2017|work=The Independent|date=1 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (but gained audible support by a number on the Conservative benches&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rayner|first1=Gordon|last2=Hope|first2=Christopher|last3=McCann|first3=Kate|title=Theresa May plans to trigger Brexit in two weeks despite defeat by 'posturing' Lords over rights of EU citizens|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/03/01/brexit-lords-vote-debate-theresa-may-pmqs-live/|accessdate=5 March 2017|work=The Telegraph|date=2 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;), adding that "Of course we don't have the power to look after our citizens overseas, not in these days when we don't have many gunboats".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Craig|first1=Jon|title=Not even Lloyd Webber can save the Tories|url=http://news.sky.com/story/not-even-sir-andrew-lloyd-webber-can-save-the-tories-10786966|accessdate=5 March 2017|work=Sky News|date=2 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Tebbit currently lives in [[Bury St Edmunds]], Suffolk.  He is an agnostic. He remarked tongue-in-cheek in a March 2011 interview, when asked whether he thinks God exists, "I'm not sure. He ought to. Things would work better."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/8422956/Lord-Tebbit-why-I-admire-Clegg-more-than-Cameron.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | author=[[Bryony Gordon]] | title=Lord Tebbit: why I admire Clegg more than Cameron | date=1 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has two sons and a daughter.&lt;ref name="Whoswho"&gt;{{cite book|title=Who's Who 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been described as a 'keen amateur chef', and has published a book on cooking game.&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|9781906779115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2013, Tebbit suffered from a heart scare, praising the NHS for their quick and decisive action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/normantebbit/100251594/the-nhs-can-be-an-elite-force-as-i-know-when-it-goes-wrong-blame-the-generals-not-the-troops/#disqus_thread | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=The NHS can be an elite force, as I know. When it goes wrong, blame the generals, not the troops | date=20 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a May 2014 interview, he talked about discovering he had been suffering with a form of [[cardiac arrhythmia]] for more than 40 years: "The suspicion I had a heart problem caused me to puzzle over earlier incidents in my life," he said, reflecting on his RAF jet fighter crash in 1954. "I suspect that, that morning, stressed from the previous day and having had little sleep, I lost consciousness on that take-off run."&lt;ref name="FlyPast"/&gt;

==In the media==
Tebbit was interviewed about the rise of [[Thatcherism]] for the 2006 [[BBC]] TV documentary series ''[[Tory! Tory! Tory!]]''. In 2011, writing in his ''[[The Daily Telegraph|Telegraph]]'' blog, he uncharacteristically praised an article in ''[[The Guardian]]'' by [[Michael White (journalist)|Michael White]]. Tebbit cited White's article (an account of [[Pauline Pearce]]'s visit to the 2011 Tory [[party conference]]) as being "a perfect illustration of my theory of the common ground of politics."&lt;ref name="telegraph betraying savers"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://archive.fo/y1t7M | title=Betraying savers and law-abiding citizens is neither modern nor compassionate | work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | date=7 October 2011 | accessdate=20 October 2011 | author=Tebbit, Norman | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tebbit was portrayed as a sinister, leather-clad [[Skinhead|bovverboy]] beating up fellow cabinet members and keeping order in Margaret Thatcher's cabinet, by the satirical TV puppet show, ''[[Spitting Image]]''. The Professor of English at [[University College London]], John Mullan, has written: "In ''Spitting Image'' and probably the middle-class imagination, Norman Tebbit was given an Essex drag on his vowels which he hardly possessed. He should speak in that way because of what he represented".&lt;ref&gt;Mullan, John [http://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/home/estuary/mullan.htm 'Lost voices'], ''The Guardian'', 18 June 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 February 2010, Tebbit was alleged to have attacked a ceremonial Chinese dragon during a [[Chinese New Year]] parade. He is said to have been unaware it was Chinese New Year and to have "kicked the rear of a child who was dressed in the traditional costume of a dragon". Tebbit later said: "I don't think my reaction was extreme at all. I placed my hand on the drum so I could diminish the noise and asked the drummer what was going on and got a rap on the knuckles for my pain. I was then barged by the dragon. I barged it back and might have done something like kick it. I wasn't sure how to deal with it. I've never been barged by a dragon before". A local Conservative town councillor, Mr Chung, visited Tebbit the day after the incident and received an apology. Chung said: "I said his actions were upsetting. He apologised. He only then understood what he had done".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8529927.stm | location=London | work=BBC | title=Tebbit apologises after Chinese dragon 'kerfuffle' | date=23 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2009, Tebbit urged voters to snub the main three political parties in the [[European Parliament election, 2009 (United Kingdom)|upcoming EU Parliament election]]. Tebbit, who in March 2009 revealed that he would vote for the [[United Kingdom Independence Party]] (UKIP), said "Local elections, the great British public should just treat as normal", but suggested using the European election to send a message to the implicated parties. Tebbit pointed out that there were a series of smaller parties people could vote for in addition to UKIP, including the [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green Party]], but he urged against voting [[British National Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/5311556/MPs-expenses-Lord-Tebbit-says-do-not-vote-Conservative-at-European-elections.html |title=MPs' expenses: Lord Tebbit says do not vote Conservative at European elections |work=The Daily Telegraph |author=Moore, Matthew |date=12 May 2009|accessdate=13 May 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013, Tebbit was one of the guests on an episode of [[Peter Hennessy]]'s [[BBC]] radio 4 programme ''Reflections''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b036y7ws/episodes/guide |title=BBC Radio 4 – Reflections – Episode guide |publisher=BBC |accessdate=9 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he talked about his life and career. Earlier that year he paid tribute to Margaret Thatcher, saying he wished there were "someone like her now".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.eadt.co.uk/news/suffolk_uk_norman_tebbit_pays_tribute_to_margaret_thatcher_1_2008386 |title=Suffolk/UK: Norman Tebbit pays tribute to Margaret Thatcher |work=East Anglian Daily Times |date= |accessdate=17 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, he contributed an interview to the documentary film ''[[Bobby Sands: 66 Days]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.breakingnews.ie/ireland/prison-diary-kept-by-ira-hunger-striker-bobby-sands-used-to-help-create-film-743780.html|title=Prison diary kept by IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands used to help create film|date=8 July 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
