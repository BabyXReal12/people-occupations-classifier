Simon &amp; Schuster, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; His books have sold more than 250 million copies worldwide.&lt;ref name="BBC 2016"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p04521p2 | title=Roald Dahl: As popular - and profitable - as ever | publisher=BBC | date=18 August 2016 | accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in [[Wales]] to Norwegian immigrant parents, Dahl served in the [[Royal Air Force]] during the [[Second World War]]. He became a [[flying ace]] and intelligence officer, rising to the rank of acting [[Wing Commander (rank)|wing commander]]. He rose to prominence as a writer in the 1940s with works for both children and adults, and he became one of the world's best-selling authors.&lt;ref name=Global/&gt;&lt;ref name=BDC/&gt; He has been referred to as "one of the greatest storytellers for children of the 20th century".&lt;ref name=IND/&gt; His awards for contribution to literature include the 1983 [[World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement]], and the [[Specsavers National Book Awards|British Book Awards']] Children's Author of the Year in 1990. In 2008, ''[[The Times]]'' placed Dahl 16th on its list of "The 50 greatest British writers since 1945".&lt;ref name=TIM&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/arts/books/article2452094.ece|title=The 50 greatest British writers since 1945|work=The Times|accessdate=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dahl's short stories are known for their unexpected endings, and his children's books for their unsentimental, macabre, often [[black comedy|darkly comic]] mood, featuring villainous adult enemies of the child characters.&lt;ref name=INT/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Aldi removes Roald Dahl's Revolting Rhymes from its Australian stores over the word 'slut'|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/australasia/aldi-removes-roald-dahl-s-revolting-rhymes-from-its-australian-stores-over-the-word-slut-9698068.html|work=The Independent|date=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His books champion the kindhearted, and feature an underlying warm sentiment.&lt;ref name="The Guardian"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC 2015"/&gt; Dahl's works for children include ''[[James and the Giant Peach]]'', ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'', ''[[Matilda (novel)|Matilda]]'',  ''[[The Witches (novel)|The Witches]]'', ''[[Fantastic Mr Fox]]'', ''[[The BFG]]'', ''[[The Twits]]'' and ''[[George's Marvellous Medicine]]''. His adult works include ''[[Tales of the Unexpected (short story collection)|Tales of the Unexpected]]''.

==Early life==

=== Childhood ===
Roald Dahl was born in 1916 at Villa Marie, Fairwater Road, in [[Llandaff]], [[Cardiff]], Wales, to Norwegian parents, Harald Dahl and Sofie Magdalene Dahl (''née'' Hesselberg).&lt;ref&gt;Philip Howard, "Dahl, Roald (1916–1990)", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Dahl's father had emigrated to the UK from [[Sarpsborg]] in Norway, and settled in Cardiff in the 1880s. His mother came over and married his father in 1911. Dahl was named after the Norwegian [[polar explorer]] [[Roald Amundsen]]. His first language was Norwegian, which he spoke at home with his parents and his sisters Astri, Alfhild and Else. Dahl and his sisters were raised in the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] faith, and were baptised at the [[Norwegian Church, Cardiff]], where their parents worshipped.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Palfrey (2006) [https://books.google.com/books?id=pOfJeCs0cDIC&amp;pg=PA76 ''Cardiff Soul: An Underground Guide to the City'']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Roald dahl mrs pratchetts sweetshop llandaff.jpg|thumb|left|Mrs Pratchett's former sweet shop in Llandaff, Cardiff, has a [[blue plaque]] commemorating the mischief played by young Roald Dahl and his friends, who were regular customers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/south_east/8253467.stm "Blue plaque marks Dahl sweet shop"]. BBC. Retrieved 24 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In 1920, when Dahl was three years old, his seven-year-old sister, Astri, died from [[appendicitis]]. Weeks later, his father died of [[pneumonia]] at the age of 57.&lt;ref name="biography"/&gt; With the option of returning to Norway to live with relatives, Dahl's mother decided to remain in Wales. Her husband Harald had wanted their children to be educated in British schools, which he considered the world's best.&lt;ref&gt;Jill C. Wheeler (2006) ''Roald Dahl'' p. 9. ABDO Publishing Company, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dahl first attended the [[The Cathedral School, Llandaff|Cathedral School]], Llandaff. At the age of eight, he and four of his friends (one named Thwaites) were [[Corporal punishment|caned]] by the headmaster after putting a dead mouse in a jar of [[gobstoppers]] at the local sweet shop,&lt;ref name=IND/&gt; which was owned by a "mean and loathsome" old woman called Mrs Pratchett.&lt;ref name=IND/&gt; The five boys named their prank the "[[Boy (book)#Great mouse plot of 1924|Great Mouse Plot of 1924]]".&lt;ref&gt;Michael D. Sharp (2006) [https://books.google.com/books?id=8d-nHl6bZtgC&amp;pg=PA516 Popular Contemporary Writers] p. 516. Marshall Cavendish, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Gobstoppers were a favourite sweet among British schoolboys between the two World Wars, and Dahl would refer to them in his creation, [[Everlasting Gobstopper]], which was featured in ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]''.&lt;ref&gt;John Ayto (2012). ''The Diner's Dictionary: Word Origins of Food and Drink''. p. 154. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dahl transferred to a [[boarding school]] in England: St Peter's in [[Weston-super-Mare]]. His parents had wanted him to be educated at an [[Independent school (United Kingdom)|English public school]] and, because of the regular [[Aust Ferry|ferry link]] across the [[Bristol Channel]], this proved to be the nearest. Dahl's time at St Peter's was unpleasant; he was very homesick and wrote to his mother every week but never revealed his unhappiness to her. After her death in 1967, he learned that she had saved every one of his letters, in small bundles held together with green tape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/arts/sites/roald-dahl/pages/media-2000-school.shtml | title= Roald Dahl's School Days | publisher=BBC Wales | accessdate=24 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, to mark the centenary of Dahl's birth, his letters to his mother were abridged and broadcast as BBC Radio 4's ''[[Book of the Week]]''.&lt;ref name="BBC Book of the Week 2016"&gt;{{cite episode| title= Book of the Week, Love from Boy - Roald Dahl's Letters to His Mother |series= [[Book of the Week]]| credits= Readers: Donald Sturrock and [[Rory Kinnear]], Abridged by: Katrin Williams, Producer: Duncan Minshull | network= [[BBC Radio]]| url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07djzlm | airdate= 5 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dahl wrote about his time at St Peter's in his autobiography ''[[Boy (book)|Boy: Tales of Childhood]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title= [[Boy (book)|Boy: Tales of Childhood]] | first= Roald | last= Dahl | publisher=Puffin Books| year= 1984 | isbn= 978-0-14-130305-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Repton School ===
[[File:Repton_School_-_geograph.org.uk_-_1303684.jpg|thumb|right|Dahl attended [[Repton School]] in Derbyshire from 1929 to 1934]]
From 1929, when he was 13, Dahl attended [[Repton School]] in Derbyshire. Dahl disliked the hazing and described an environment of ritual cruelty and status domination, with younger boys having to act as [[fagging|personal servants]] for older boys, frequently subject to terrible beatings.

His biographer Donald Sturrock described these violent experiences in Dahl's early life.&lt;ref name="Dahl"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/biographyandmemoirreviews/7932061/Roald-Dahls-schooldays.html|title=Roald Dahl's schooldays were filled with the ritual cruelty of fagging for older boys and with terrible beatings|website=Daily Telegraph|access-date=2016-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dahl expresses some of these darker experiences in his writings, which is also marked by his hatred of cruelty and [[corporal punishment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.corpun.com/webschuk.htm|title=WEB LINKS: corporal punishment in British schools|website=www.corpun.com|access-date=2016-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[Boy (book)|Boy: Tales of Childhood]]'', a friend named Michael was viciously caned by headmaster [[Geoffrey Fisher]]. Writing it that same book, Dahl reflected:&lt;blockquote&gt;“All through my school life I was appalled by the fact that masters and senior boys were allowed literally to wound other boys, and sometimes quite severely... I couldn’t get over it. I never have got over it.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/boarding-school-magic/#!|title=Boarding School Magic - Los Angeles Review of Books|work=Los Angeles Review of Books|access-date=2018-07-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The master was later selected as the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] and [[Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II|crowned]] [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1953. (However, according to Dahl's biographer [[Jeremy Treglown]],&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Treglown, ''Roald Dahl: A Biography'' (1994), Faber and Faber, page 21. Treglown's source note is as follows: "Several people who were at the top of Priory House at the time have discussed it with me, particularly B.L.L. Reuss and John Bradburn."&lt;/ref&gt; the caning took place in May 1933, a year after Fisher had left Repton; the headmaster was in fact [[John Traill Christie|J. T. Christie]], Fisher's successor.)

Dahl said the incident caused him to "have doubts about religion and even about God".&lt;ref name="boy"&gt;{{Cite book|title=[[Boy (book)|Boy: Tales of Childhood]] |last=Dahl |first=Roald |year=1984 |publisher=[[Jonathan Cape]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was never seen as a particularly talented writer in his school years, with one of his English teachers writing in his school report "I have never met anybody who so persistently writes words meaning the exact opposite of what is intended."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/rdahl.htm |title=Roald Dahl |website=Books and Writers ''(kirjasto.sci.fi)'' |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210175324/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/rdahl.htm |archivedate=10 February 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dahl was exceptionally tall, reaching {{convert|6|ft|6|in}} in adult life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.penguin.co.uk/nf/Author/AuthorPage/0,,1000008184,00.html Roald Dahl&amp;nbsp;– Penguin UK Authors] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071201173227/http://www.penguin.co.uk/nf/Author/AuthorPage/0,,1000008184,00.html |date=1 December 2007 }}&amp;nbsp;– Penguin UK&lt;/ref&gt; He played a number of sports including cricket, [[Association football|football]] and golf, and was made captain of the [[Squash (sport)|squash]] team.&lt;ref&gt;Shavick, Andrea (1997) [https://books.google.com/books?id=DovoRMkvxjUC&amp;pg=PA12 Roald Dahl: the champion storyteller] p.12. Oxford University Press, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; As well as having a passion for literature, he developed an interest in photography and often carried a camera with him.&lt;ref name="biography"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/arts/sites/roald-dahl/pages/biography.shtml|title=Roald Dahl biography|accessdate=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his years at Repton, the [[Cadbury]] chocolate company would occasionally send boxes of new chocolates to the school to be tested by the pupils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Repton School 'helped inspire Dahl' to write Charlie|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-derbyshire-14896806|publisher=BBC|date=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dahl would dream of inventing a new chocolate bar that would win the praise of [[Cadbury family|Mr Cadbury]] himself; this inspired him in writing his third children's book, ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'' (1964), and to refer to chocolate in other children's books.&lt;ref name="DahlChocolate"&gt;{{Cite book|year=2005|author=Roald Dahl (derivative work) and [[Quentin Blake]]|isbn=0-14-131959-3|title=Roald Dahl's Incredible Chocolate Box}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout his childhood and adolescent years, Dahl spent the majority of his summer holidays with his mother's family in Norway. He wrote about many happy memories from those visits in ''Boy: Tales of Childhood'', such as when he replaced the tobacco in his half–sister's fiancé's pipe with goat droppings.&lt;ref&gt;''Boy and Going Solo'', p.128 – p.132&lt;/ref&gt; He noted only one unhappy memory of his holidays in Norway: at around the age of eight, he had to have his [[adenoid]]s removed by a doctor.&lt;ref&gt;''Boy and Going Solo'', p.68 – 71&lt;/ref&gt; His childhood and first job selling kerosene in [[Midsomer Norton]] and surrounding villages in [[Somerset]] are subjects in ''Boy: Tales of Childhood''.&lt;ref&gt;Dahl, Roald (1984) ''Boy: Tales of Childhood'' p.172. Puffin Books, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

=== After school ===
After finishing his schooling, in August 1934 Dahl crossed the Atlantic on the {{RMS|Nova Scotia|1926|6}} and hiked through [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] with the [[BSES Expeditions|Public Schools Exploring Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sturrock |first=Donald |year=2010 |title=Storyteller: The Authorised Biography of Roald Dahl |location=London |publisher=[[HarperCollins|HarperPress]] |isbn=0007254768 |pages=93–94 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/149746/Roald-Dahl|title=Roald Dahl (British author)|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1934, Dahl joined the [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell Petroleum]] Company. Following two years of training in the United Kingdom, he was assigned first to [[Mombasa]], Kenya, then to [[Dar-es-Salaam]], [[Tanganyika]] (now Tanzania). Along with the only two other Shell employees in the entire territory, he lived in luxury in the Shell House outside Dar es Salaam, with a cook and personal servants. While out on assignments supplying oil to customers across Tanganyika, he encountered [[black mamba]]s and lions, among other wildlife.&lt;ref name="boy" /&gt;

==Fighter ace==
[[File:Roald Dahl's leather flying helmet.jpg|thumb|Dahl's leather flying helmet on display in the [[Roald Dahl Museum and Story Centre]] in Great Missenden]]
In August 1939, as the Second World War loomed, the British made plans to round up the hundreds of Germans living in [[Dar-es-Salaam]]. Dahl was commissioned as a [[Lieutenant (British Army and Royal Marines)|lieutenant]] into the [[King's African Rifles]], commanding a platoon of [[Askari]] men, indigenous troops who were serving in the colonial army.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Sturrock [https://books.google.com/books?id=udN6caZEJesC&amp;pg=PA116&amp;dq=roald+Dahl+-+King's+African+Rifle&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=7RMNTazoEIqEhQfuk8S3Dg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Storyteller: The Authorized Biography of Roald Dahl''], p.116. Simon and Schuster, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1939, Dahl joined the [[Royal Air Force]] as an [[aircraftman]] with service number 774022.&lt;ref name="LG5907"&gt;[https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/34964/page/5907 Issue 34964]. ''[[London Gazette]]''. 8 October 1940. page 5907&lt;/ref&gt; After a {{convert|600|mi|km|adj=on}} car journey from Dar es Salaam to [[Nairobi]], he was accepted for flight training with sixteen other men; only three others of these survived the war. With seven hours and 40 minutes experience in a [[De Havilland Tiger Moth]], he flew solo;&lt;ref&gt;Sturrock (2010: 120)&lt;/ref&gt; Dahl enjoyed watching the wildlife of [[Kenya]] during his flights. He continued to advanced flying training in Iraq, at [[RAF Habbaniya]], {{convert|50|mi|km}} west of [[Baghdad]]. Following six months' training on [[Hawker Hart]]s, Dahl was commissioned as a [[pilot officer]] on 24 August 1940, and was judged ready to join a squadron and face the enemy.&lt;ref name="LG5907"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Conant, Jennet (2008). The Irregulars: Roald Dahl and the British Spy Ring in Wartime Washington. p. 3. Simon and Schuster&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gloster Gladiator.jpg|thumb|right|Dahl was flying a [[Gloster Gladiator]] when he crash landed in Libya]]

He was assigned to [[No. 80 Squadron RAF]], flying obsolete [[Gloster Gladiator]]s, the last [[biplane]] [[fighter aircraft]] used by the RAF. Dahl was surprised to find that he would not receive any specialised training in [[aerial combat]], or in flying Gladiators. On 19 September 1940, Dahl was ordered to fly his Gladiator by stages from Abu Sueir (near [[Ismailia]], in [[Egypt]]) to 80 Squadron's forward [[airstrip]] {{convert|30|mi|km}} south of [[Mersa Matruh]]. On the final leg he could not find the airstrip and, running low on [[fuel]] and with night approaching, he was forced to attempt a [[Accidents and incidents in aviation#Causes|landing]] in the desert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/7934421/Roald-Dahl-the-plane-crash-that-gave-birth-to-a-writer.html|title=Roald Dahl: the plane crash that gave birth to a writer|date=9 August 2010|work=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The undercarriage hit a boulder and the aircraft crashed. Dahl's skull was fractured and his nose was smashed; he was temporarily blinded.&lt;ref name=WRN&gt;Alan Warren (1988) [https://books.google.com/books?id=X5BaAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=dahl+fractured+his+skull&amp;dq=dahl+fractured+his+skull&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=iYsHTZO5N86ChQfgj4ntBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAw Roald Dahl] pp.12, 87. Starmont House, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; He managed to drag himself away from the blazing wreckage and passed out. He wrote about the crash in his first published work.&lt;ref name=WRN/&gt;

Dahl was rescued and taken to a [[first aid|first-aid]] post in Mersa Matruh, where he regained consciousness, but not his sight. He was transported by train to the Royal Navy hospital in [[Alexandria]]. There he fell in and out of love with a nurse, Mary Welland. A RAF inquiry into the crash revealed that the location to which he had been told to fly was completely wrong, and he had mistakenly been sent instead to the [[no man's land]] between the Allied and Italian forces.&lt;ref name="solo"&gt;{{Cite book|title=[[Going Solo]] |last=Dahl |first=Roald |year=1986 |publisher=Jonathan Cape}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hurricane_mk1_r4118_fairford_arp.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Hawker Hurricane|Hawker Hurricane Mk 1]], the aircraft type in which Dahl engaged in aerial combat over Greece.]]

In February 1941, Dahl was discharged from hospital and passed fully fit for flying duties. By this time, 80 Squadron had been transferred to the [[Battle of Greece|Greek campaign]] and based at [[Eleusina]], near [[Athens]]. The squadron was now equipped with [[Hawker Hurricane]]s. Dahl flew a replacement Hurricane across the Mediterranean Sea in April 1941, after seven hours' experience flying Hurricanes. By this stage in the Greek campaign, the RAF had only 18 combat aircraft in Greece: 14 Hurricanes and four [[Bristol Blenheim]] light bombers. Dahl flew in his first aerial combat on 15 April 1941, while flying alone over the city of [[Chalcis]]. He attacked six [[Junkers Ju 88]]s that were bombing ships and shot one down. On 16 April in another air battle, he shot down another Ju 88.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Thomas [https://books.google.com/books?id=4u-QXw2bjwUC&amp;pg=PA36 ''Hurricane Aces 1941–45''], Osprey Publishing, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 April 1941, Dahl took part in the [[Battle of Athens (1941)|Battle of Athens]], alongside the highest-scoring British Commonwealth ace of World War II, [[Pat Pattle]], and Dahl's friend [[David Coke]]. Of 12 Hurricanes involved, five were shot down and four of their pilots killed, including Pattle. Greek observers on the ground counted 22 German aircraft downed, but because of the confusion of the aerial engagement, none of the pilots knew which aircraft they had shot down. Dahl described it as "an endless blur of enemy fighters whizzing towards me from every side".&lt;ref&gt;Roald Dahl [https://books.google.com/books?id=weZxpJUHuPUC&amp;q=an+endless+blur+of+enemy+fighters+whizzing+towards+me+from+every&amp;dq=an+endless+blur+of+enemy+fighters+whizzing+towards+me+from+every ''Going Solo''], p. 151.

In May, as the Germans were pressing on Athens, Dahl was evacuated to Egypt. His squadron was reassembled in [[Haifa]]. From there, Dahl flew sorties every day for a period of four weeks, shooting down a [[Vichy French Air Force]] [[Potez 63]] on 8 June and another Ju 88 on 15 June, but he began to get severe headaches that caused him to black out. He was invalided home to Britain. Though at this time Dahl was only a pilot officer on probation, in September 1941 he was simultaneously confirmed as a [[pilot officer]] and promoted to war substantive [[flying officer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=35292 |date=30 September 1941 |page=5664 |nolink=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diplomat, writer and intelligence officer==
After being invalided home, Dahl was posted to an RAF training camp in [[Uxbridge]]. He attempted to recover his health enough to become an instructor.&lt;ref&gt;Sturrock (2010: 163)&lt;/ref&gt; In late March 1942, while in London, he met the [[Under-Secretary of State for Air]], Major Harold Balfour (later [[Harold Balfour, 1st Baron Balfour of Inchrye|Lord Balfour]]), at his club. Impressed by Dahl's war record and conversational abilities, Balfour appointed the young man as assistant air attaché at the [[British Embassy]] in Washington, D.C. Initially resistant, Dahl was finally persuaded by Balfour to accept, and took passage on the SS ''Batori'' from Glasgow a few days later. He arrived in Halifax, Canada, on 14 April, after which he took a sleeper train to [[Montreal]].&lt;ref&gt;Sturrock (2010: 165)&lt;/ref&gt;

Coming from war-starved Britain, Dahl was amazed by the wealth of food and amenities to be had in North America.&lt;ref&gt;Sturrock (2010: 163–165)&lt;/ref&gt; Arriving in Washington a week later, Dahl found he liked the atmosphere of the U.S. capital. He shared a house with another attaché at 1610 34th Street, NW, in [[Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)|Georgetown]]. But after ten days in his new posting, Dahl strongly disliked it, feeling he had taken on "a most ungodly unimportant job."&lt;ref&gt;Sturrock (2010: 166–167)&lt;/ref&gt; He later explained, "I'd just come from the war. People were getting killed. I had been flying around, seeing horrible things. Now, almost instantly, I found myself in the middle of a pre-war cocktail party in America."&lt;ref&gt;Sturrock (2010: 167)&lt;/ref&gt;

Dahl was unimpressed by his office in the British Air Mission, attached to the embassy. He was also unimpressed by the ambassador, [[Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]], with whom he sometimes played tennis and whom he described as "a courtly English gentleman". Dahl socialized with Charles E. Marsh, a Texas publisher and oilman, at his house at 2136 R Street, NW, and the Marsh country estate in Virginia.&lt;!-- Also at this time he joined the [[British Security Coordination]], that covertly sought to influence U.S. policy to favor Great Britain. --&gt;&lt;ref name="solo" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Dietsch_2013&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[The Washington Post Magazine]] |page=10 |date=1 December 2013 |first=Deborah K. |last=Dietsch |title=Roald Dahl Slept Here: From attaché to author &lt;!-- |authorlink=Deborah B.

At this time Dahl met the noted British novelist [[C. S. Forester]], who was also working to aid the British war effort. Forester worked for the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|British Ministry of Information]] and was writing propaganda for the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] cause, mainly for American consumption.&lt;ref&gt;''Cambridge Guide to Literature'' (Cambridge University Press, 1989) {{ISBN|0-521-26751-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Saturday Evening Post'' had asked Forester to write a story based on Dahl's flying experiences; Forester asked Dahl to write down some RAF anecdotes so that he could shape them into a story. After Forester read what Dahl had given him, he decided to publish the story exactly as Dahl had written it.&lt;ref name="BBC Studios 2016" /&gt; He originally titled the article as "A Piece of Cake" but the magazine changed it to "Shot Down Over Libya" to make it sound more dramatic, although Dahl had not been shot down; it was published in the 1 August 1942 issue of the ''Post''. Dahl was promoted to [[flight lieutenant]] (war-substantive) in August 1942.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/35791/supplement/5037 Issue 35791]. ''[[London Gazette]]''. 17 November 1942. p. 5037&lt;/ref&gt;  Later he worked with such other well-known British officers as [[Ian Fleming]] (who later published the popular ''James Bond'' series) and [[David Ogilvy (businessman)|David Ogilvy]], promoting Britain's interests and message in the U.S. and combating the "[[America First Committee|America First]]" movement.&lt;ref name="The Irreg"&gt;The book ''Irregulars: Roald Dahl and the British Spy Ring in Wartime Washington'' (by [[Jennet Conant]], Simon and Schuster 2008) describes this era of Dahl's life and those with whom he worked.&lt;/ref&gt;

This work introduced Dahl to espionage and the activities of the Canadian spymaster [[William Stephenson]], known by the codename "Intrepid".&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Schoeck [https://books.google.com/books?id=-JbF6kwRZiMC&amp;pg=PA221 ''I was There: A Century of Alumni Stories about the University of Alberta, 1906–2006''], University of Alberta, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; During the war, Dahl supplied intelligence from Washington to Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]]. As Dahl later said: "My job was to try to help Winston to get on with [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|FDR]], and tell Winston what was in the old boy's mind."&lt;ref name="BBC Studios 2016"&gt;The Marvellous World of Roald Dahl. BBC Studios. 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Dahl also supplied intelligence to Stephenson and his organisation, known as [[British Security Coordination]], which was part of [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]].&lt;ref name=Dietsch_2013/&gt; Dahl was once sent back to Britain by British Embassy officials, supposedly for misconduct—"I got booted out by the big boys," he said. Stephenson promptly sent him back to Washington—with a promotion to [[Wing Commander (rank)|wing commander]] rank.&lt;ref&gt;Bill Macdonald. ''The True Intrepid''. p. 249 (Raincoast 2001){{ISBN|1-55192-418-8}}; Dahl also speaks about his espionage work in the documentary ''The True Intrepid''.&lt;/ref&gt; Toward the end of the war, Dahl wrote some of the history of the secret organisation; he and Stephenson remained friends for decades after the war.&lt;ref&gt;Macdonald. ''The True Intrepid''. p. 243. {{ISBN|1-55192-418-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon the war's conclusion, Dahl held the rank of a temporary [[Wing Commander (rank)|wing commander]] (substantive flight lieutenant). Owing to the severity of his injuries from the 1940 accident, he was pronounced unfit for further service and was invalided out of the RAF in August 1946. He left the service with the substantive rank of [[squadron leader]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/37681/supplement/4054 Issue 37681]. ''[[London Gazette]]''. 9 August 1946. page 4054.&lt;/ref&gt; His record of five aerial victories, qualifying him as a [[flying ace]], has been confirmed by post-war research and cross-referenced in Axis records. It is most likely that he scored more than those victories during 20 April 1941, when 22 German aircraft were shot down.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Shores and Clive Williams.

==Post-war life==
[[File:Patricia Neal und Roald Dahl.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Patricia Neal]] and Roald Dahl]]
Dahl married American actress [[Patricia Neal]] on 2 July 1953 at [[Trinity Church, New York|Trinity Church]] in New York City. Their marriage lasted for 30 years and they had five children:

On 5 December 1960, four-month-old Theo Dahl was severely injured when his baby carriage was struck by a taxicab in New York City. For a time, he suffered from [[hydrocephalus]]. As a result, his father became involved in the development of what became known as the "[[Wade-Dahl-Till valve|Wade-Dahl-Till]]" (or WDT) valve, a device to alleviate the condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medgadget.com/archives/2005/07/water_on_the_br.html|title=Water on the Brain|date=15 July 2005|accessdate=11 May 2006|work=MedGadget: Internet Journal of Emerging Medical Technologies|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060522112305/http://www.medgadget.com/archives/2005/07/water_on_the_br.html|archive-date=22 May 2006|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=larner&gt;{{cite web

In November 1962, Dahl's daughter Olivia died of [[Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis|measles encephalitis]], age seven. Her death left Dahl "limp with despair", and feeling guilty about not having been able to do anything for her.&lt;ref name="Olivia"/&gt; Dahl subsequently became a proponent of [[immunisation]] and dedicated his 1982 book ''[[The BFG]]'' to his daughter.&lt;ref&gt;Singh, Anita (7 August 2010) [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/7930637/Roald-Dahls-secret-notebook-reveals-heartbreak-over-daughters-death.html "Roald Dahl's secret notebook reveals heartbreak over daughter's death"], ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''.

In 1965, his wife Patricia Neal suffered three burst [[cerebral aneurysm]]s while pregnant with their fifth child, Lucy.

I am anti-Israel."&lt;ref name=treg /&gt; Dahl told a reporter in 1983, "There's a trait in the Jewish character that does provoke animosity ...

Could have been pro-Arab or pro-Jew. There was no consistent line. He was a man who followed whims, which meant he would blow up in one direction, so to speak."&lt;ref name=treg /&gt; Amelia Foster, director of the Roald Dahl Museum in Great Missenden, says, "This is again an example of how Dahl refused to take anything seriously, even himself. He was very angry at the Israelis. He had a childish reaction to what was going on in Israel. Dahl wanted to provoke, as he always provoked at dinner. His publisher was a Jew, his agent was a Jew... and he thought nothing but good things of them.

[[Image:Deviousdahl.jpg|right|thumb|Roald Dahl's story "The Devious Bachelor" was illustrated by Frederick Siebel when it was published in ''[[Collier's Weekly|Collier's]]'' (September 1953).]]
Dahl's first published work, inspired by a meeting with [[C. S. Forester]], was "A Piece of Cake", on 1 August 1942. The story, about his wartime adventures, was bought by ''The Saturday Evening Post'' for US$1,000 (a substantial sum in 1942) and published under the title "Shot Down Over Libya".&lt;ref&gt;Frances E.

Dahl also had a successful parallel career as the writer of macabre adult short stories, usually with a dark sense of humour and a surprise ending.&lt;ref name=arwd/&gt; The [[Mystery Writers of America]] presented Dahl with three [[Edgar Awards]] for his work, and many were originally written for American magazines such as ''[[Collier's Weekly|Collier's]]'' ("The Collector's Item" was ''Collier's'' Star Story of the week for 4 September 1948), ''[[Ladies Home Journal]]'', ''[[Harper's Magazine|Harper's]]'', ''[[Playboy]]'' and ''[[The New Yorker]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Roald Dahl Day: From Tales of the Unexpected to Switch Bitch, Dahl's undervalued stories for adults|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/roald-dahl-day-adult-books-tales-unexpected-switch-bitch-kiss-kiss-short-stories-a7944351.html|work=The Independent|date=6 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Works such as ''[[Kiss Kiss (book)|Kiss Kiss]]'' subsequently collected Dahl's stories into anthologies, gaining worldwide acclaim.

One of his more famous adult stories, "The Smoker", also known as "[[Man from the South]]", was filmed twice as both 1960 and 1985 episodes of ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'', and also adapted into [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s segment of the 1995 film ''[[Four Rooms]]''.&lt;ref name=quet/&gt; This oft-anthologised classic concerns a man in Jamaica who wagers with visitors in an attempt to claim the fingers from their hands.

Dahl acquired a traditional [[Romanichal]] [[vardo (Romani wagon)|vardo]] in the 1960s, and the family used it as a playhouse for his children at home in [[Great Missenden]], Buckinghamshire.

===Children's fiction===
{{Quote box|width=28%|align=right|quote="He [Dahl] was mischievous. A grown-up being mischievous. He addresses you, a child, as somebody who knows about the world. He was a grown-up – and he was bigger than most – who is on your side. That must have something to do with it."|source=—Illustrator [[Quentin Blake]] on the lasting appeal of Dahl's children's books.&lt;ref name=IND/&gt;}}
Dahl's children's works are usually told from the point of view of a child. They typically involve adult [[villain]]s who hate and mistreat children, and feature at least one "good" adult to counteract the villain(s).&lt;ref name=IND/&gt; These stock characters are possibly a reference to the abuse that Dahl stated that he experienced in the [[boarding school]]s he attended.&lt;ref name=IND/&gt; Dahl's books see the triumph of the child; children's book critic Amanda Craig said, "He was unequivocal that it is the good, young and kind who triumph over the old, greedy and the wicked."&lt;ref name="BBC 2015"&gt;{{cite news|title=Roald Dahl and the darkness within|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-14880441|publisher=BBC|date=15 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; While his whimsical fantasy stories feature an underlying warm sentiment, they usually contain a lot of [[black comedy|darkly comic]] and grotesque scenarios, including gruesome violence.&lt;ref name=INT/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|title=Roald Dahl's greatest philosophical quotes ever|url=https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2015/nov/27/roald-dahls-greatest-philosophical-quotes-ever|work=The Guardian|date=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Witches (novel)|The Witches]]'', ''[[George's Marvellous Medicine]]'' and ''[[Matilda (novel)|Matilda]]'' are examples of this formula. ''[[The BFG]]'' follows it in a more analogous way with the good giant (the BFG or "Big Friendly Giant") representing the "good adult" archetype and the other giants being the "bad adults". This formula is also somewhat evident in Dahl's film script for ''[[Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (film)|Chitty Chitty Bang Bang]]''. Class-conscious themes also surface in works such as ''[[Fantastic Mr Fox]]'' and ''[[Danny, the Champion of the World]]'' where the unpleasant wealthy neighbours are outwitted.&lt;ref name="BBC Studios 2016"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Fantastic Mr. Fox' movie review: Wes Anderson joyfully re-creates Roald Dahl's foxy family|url=http://www.nj.com/entertainment/tv/index.ssf/2009/11/post_25.html|work=[[The Star-Ledger]]|date=21 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dahl also features in his books characters who are very fat, usually children. Augustus Gloop, Bruce Bogtrotter and Bruno Jenkins are a few of these characters, although an enormous woman named Aunt Sponge is featured in ''[[James and the Giant Peach]]'' and the nasty farmer Boggis in ''[[Fantastic Mr Fox]]'' is an enormously fat character. All of these characters (with the possible exception of Bruce Bogtrotter) are either villains or simply unpleasant gluttons. They are usually punished for this: Augustus Gloop drinks from [[Willy Wonka]]'s chocolate river, disregarding the adults who tell him not to, and falls in, getting sucked up a pipe and nearly being turned into fudge. In ''[[Matilda (novel)|Matilda]]'', Bruce Bogtrotter steals cake from the evil headmistress, Miss Trunchbull, and is forced to eat a gigantic chocolate cake in front of the school. Featured in ''[[The Witches (book)|The Witches]]'', Bruno Jenkins is lured by the witches into their convention with the promise of chocolate, before they turn him into a mouse.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Marlow (2013). ''Audition Speeches for 6-16 Year Olds''. p. 46. Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; Aunt Sponge is flattened by a giant peach. Dahl's mother used to tell him and his sisters tales about trolls and other mythical Norwegian creatures and some of his children's books contain references or elements inspired by these stories, such as the giants in ''[[The BFG]]'', the fox family in ''Fantastic Mr Fox'' and the trolls in ''[[The Minpins]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Jenny Volvovski, Julia Rothman, Matt Lamothe (2014). ''The Who, the What, and the When: 65 Artists Illustrate the Secret Sidekicks of History''. p. 28. Chronicle Books&lt;/ref&gt;

Receiving the 1983 [[World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement]], Dahl encouraged his children and his readers to let their imagination run free. His daughter Lucy stated "his spirit was so large and so big he taught us to believe in magic."&lt;ref name="BBC Studios 2016"/&gt;

{{Quote|Those who don't believe in magic will never find it.|Roald Dahl, ''The Minpins''}}

Dahl was also famous for his inventive, playful use of language, which was a key element to his writing. He would invent new words by scribbling down his words before swapping letters around and adopting [[spoonerisms]] and [[malapropisms]].&lt;ref name="Dahl Dictionary"/&gt; The lexicographer Dr Susan Rennie stated that Dahl built his new words on familiar sounds, adding:

{{quote|He didn't always explain what his words meant, but children can work them out because they often sound like a word they know, and he loved using [[onomatopoeia]]. For example, you know that something ''lickswishy'' and ''delumptious'' is good to eat, whereas something ''uckyslush'' or ''rotsome'' is not definitely not! He also used sounds that children love to say, like ''squishous'' and ''squizzle'', or ''fizzlecrump'' and ''fizzwiggler''.&lt;ref name="Dahl Dictionary"/&gt;}}

In 2016, marking the centenary of Dahl's birth, Rennie compiled ''The Oxford Roald Dahl Dictionary'' which includes many of his invented words and their meaning.&lt;ref name="Dahl Dictionary"&gt;{{cite news|title=Dahl's squishous words get their own dictionary|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-36397983|publisher=BBC|date=28 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rennie commented that some of Dahl's words have already escaped his world, for example, ''Scrumdiddlyumptious'': "Food that is utterly delicious".&lt;ref name="Dahl Dictionary"/&gt; In his poetry, Dahl gives a humorous re-interpretation of well-known nursery rhymes and [[fairy tales]], providing surprise endings in place of the traditional happily-ever-after. Dahl's collection of poems ''[[Revolting Rhymes]]'' is recorded in [[audiobook]] form, and narrated by actor [[Alan Cumming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Y7aeAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=audio+book+dirty+beasts&amp;q=alan+cumming|title=AV guide, Volumes 77–82|publisher=Scranton Gillette Communications|date= 1998|accessdate=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Screenplays===
For a brief period in the 1960s, Dahl wrote screenplays. Two, the [[James Bond]] film ''[[You Only Live Twice (film)|You Only Live Twice]]'' and ''[[Chitty Chitty Bang Bang]]'', were adaptations of novels by [[Ian Fleming]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2013/sep/13/roald-dahl-great-writers-imagination-lacey ''Roald Dahl Day: my glimpse into the great writer's imagination'']. ''The Guardian''. Retrieved 22 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Dahl also began adapting his own novel ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'', which was completed and rewritten by [[David Seltzer]] after Dahl failed to meet deadlines, and produced as the film ''[[Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory]]'' (1971). Dahl later disowned the film, saying he was "disappointed" because "he thought it placed too much emphasis on Willy Wonka and not enough on Charlie".&lt;ref&gt;Liz Buckingham, trustee for the Roald Dahl Museum, quoted in Tom Bishop: [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4660873.stm ''Willy Wonka's Everlasting Film Plot''], BBC News, July 2005&lt;/ref&gt; He was also "infuriated" by the deviations in the plot devised by David Seltzer in his draft of the screenplay. This resulted in his refusal for any more versions of the book to be made in his lifetime, as well as an adaptation for the sequel ''[[Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Bishop (July 2005) [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4660873.stm "Willy Wonka's Everlasting Film Plot"]. [[BBC News]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influences===
[[File:Dylan Thomas Writing Shed (7896662300).jpg|thumb|right|Interior of [[Dylan Thomas]]'s writing shed. Dahl made a replica of it in his own garden in Great Missenden where he wrote many of his stories]]

A major part of Dahl's literary influences stemmed from his childhood. In his younger days, he was an avid reader, especially awed by fantastic tales of heroism and triumph. Amongst his favourite authors were [[Rudyard Kipling]], [[Charles Dickens]], [[William Makepeace Thackeray]] and [[Frederick Marryat]], and their works went on to make a lasting mark on his life and writing.&lt;ref&gt;Rennay Craats (2003). ''Roald Dahl''. p. 1957. Weigl, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Finding too many distractions in his house, Dahl remembered the poet [[Dylan Thomas]] had found a peaceful shed to write in close to home. Dahl travelled to visit Thomas's hut in Carmarthenshire, Wales in the 1950s and, after taking a look inside, decided to make a replica of it to write in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=How Dylan Thomas's writing shed inspired Roald Dahl|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-37342271|agency=BBC|date=18 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dahl was also a huge fan of ghost stories and claimed that ''Trolls'' by [[Jonas Lie (writer)|Jonas Lie]] was one of the finest ghost stories ever written. While he was still a youngster, his mother, Sofie Dahl, would relate traditional Norwegian myths and legends from her native homeland to Dahl and his sisters. Dahl always maintained that his mother and her stories had a strong influence on his writing. In one interview, he mentioned: "She was a great teller of tales. Her memory was prodigious and nothing that ever happened to her in her life was forgotten."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/3559378/Roald-Dahl-young-tales-of-the-unexpected.html|title=Roald Dahl: young tales of the unexpected|date=30 August 2008|work=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Dahl started writing and publishing his famous books for children, he created a grandmother character in ''[[The Witches (book)|The Witches]]'' and later stated that she was based directly on his own mother as a tribute.&lt;ref name=infloox&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infloox.com/person?id=6a5f6877|title=Roald Dahl|accessdate=16 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141205053632/http://www.infloox.com/person?id=6a5f6877|archive-date=5 December 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=infloox-1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infloox.com/influence?id=e00077f|title=Mother: Sofie Dahl {influence upon} Roald Dahl|accessdate=16 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141205053628/http://www.infloox.com/influence?id=e00077f|archive-date=5 December 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television===
In 1961, Dahl hosted and wrote for a [[science fiction]] and [[Horror and terror|horror]] television [[anthology series]] called ''[[Way Out (TV series)|Way Out]]'', which preceded the ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|Twilight Zone]]'' series on the [[CBS]] network for 14 episodes from March to July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054574/|title=Way Out (TV Series 1961)|date=8 January 2005|publisher=Internet Movie Database|accessdate=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the last dramatic network shows shot in New York City, the entire series is available for viewing at [[The Paley Center for Media]] in New York City and Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paleycenter.org/collection/item/?q=gunsmoke&amp;p=4&amp;item=T:06395|title=The Paley Center for Media: Way Out|work=The Paley Center for Media|accessdate=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote for the satirical [[BBC]] comedy programme ''[[That Was the Week That Was]]'', which was hosted by [[David Frost]].&lt;ref&gt;McCann 2006, p.156&lt;/ref&gt;

The British television series, ''[[Tales of the Unexpected (TV series)|Tales of the Unexpected]]'', originally aired on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] between 1979 and 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/series/861|title=BFI: Film and TV Database – Tales of the Unexpected|work=BFI|accessdate=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series was released to tie in with Dahl's [[Tales of the Unexpected (book)|short story anthology of the same name]], which had introduced readers to many motifs that were common in his writing.&lt;ref name=totu/&gt; The series was an anthology of different tales, initially based on Dahl's short stories.&lt;ref name=totu/&gt; The stories were sometimes sinister, sometimes wryly comedic and usually had a twist ending. Dahl introduced on camera all the episodes of the first two series, which bore the full title ''Roald Dahl's Tales of the Unexpected''.&lt;ref&gt;Vincent Terrace (1985) [https://books.google.com/books?id=AKlgjBCPPnsC&amp;pg=PA406 Encyclopedia of Television Series, Pilots and Specials: 1974–1984]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacy==
[[File:RoaldDahlgrave.jpg|thumb|right|Dahl's gravestone, St Peter and St Paul's Church, [[Great Missenden]], Buckinghamshire]]

Roald Dahl died on 23 November 1990, at the age of 74 of a rare cancer of the blood, [[myelodysplastic syndrome]], in [[Oxford]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.findmypast.com/BirthsMarriagesDeaths.jsp |title=Deaths England and Wales 1984–2006 |publisher=Findmypast.com |accessdate=28 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was buried in the cemetery at St Peter and St Paul's Church in [[Great Missenden]], Buckinghamshire, England. According to his granddaughter, the family gave him a "sort of [[Viking funeral]]". He was buried with his [[snooker cue]]s, some very good [[Burgundy wine|burgundy]], chocolates, [[No. 2 pencil|HB pencils]] and a [[circular saw|power saw]]. Today, children continue to leave toys and flowers by his grave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A giant peach of a property in Dahl country|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/life/property/article3946352.ece|work=The Times|date=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In November 1996, the [[Roald Dahl Children's Gallery]] was opened at the [[Buckinghamshire County Museum]] in nearby [[Aylesbury]].&lt;ref&gt;Sharron L.

In 2002, one of [[Cardiff Bay]]'s modern landmarks, the Oval Basin plaza, was renamed ''[[Roald Dahl Plass]]''. ''Plass'' is  Norwegian for "place" or "square", alluding to the writer's Norwegian roots. There have also been calls from the public for a permanent statue of him to be erected in [[Cardiff]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2009/03/27/roald-dahl-and-the-chinese-chip-shop-91466-23243373/|title=Roald Dahl and the Chinese chip shop|work=walesonline|accessdate=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the city celebrated the centenary of Dahl's birth in [[Llandaff]]. Welsh Arts organisations, including [[National Theatre Wales]], [[Wales Millennium Centre]] and [[Literature Wales]], came together for a series of events, titled Roald Dahl 100, including a Cardiff-wide City of the Unexpected, which marked his legacy.&lt;ref name=Global/&gt;

Dahl's charitable commitments in the fields of [[neurology]], [[haematology]] and [[literacy]] during his life have been continued by his widow since his death, through Roald Dahl's Marvellous Children's Charity, formerly known as the Roald Dahl Foundation.&lt;ref name=TELG/&gt; The charity provides care and support to seriously ill children and young people throughout the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roalddahl.com/charity |title=Roald Dahl's Marvellous Children's Charity |publisher=Marvellouschildrenscharity.org |accessdate=28 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2005, the [[Roald Dahl Museum and Story Centre]] in the author's home village [[Great Missenden]] was officially opened by [[Cherie Blair]], wife of UK Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]], to celebrate the work of Roald Dahl and advance his work in literacy education.&lt;ref&gt;Clarie Heald (11 June 2005) [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4079720.stm "Chocolate doors thrown open to Dahl"].

In honour of Dahl, the [[Royal Gibraltar Post Office]] issued a set of four stamps in 2010 featuring [[Quentin Blake]]'s original illustrations for four of the children's books written by Dahl during his long career; ''[[The BFG]]'', ''[[The Twits]]'', ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'', and ''[[Matilda (novel)|Matilda]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldstampnews.com/2010/05/gibraltar-will-launch-a-roald-dahl-set-of-stamps/#more-213 |title=UK world's best selling children author on Gibraltar stamps |publisher=World Stamp News (worldstampnews.com) |date=15 May 2010 |accessdate=28 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718114636/http://www.worldstampnews.com/2010/05/gibraltar-will-launch-a-roald-dahl-set-of-stamps/#more-213 |archivedate=18 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A set of six stamps was issued by [[Royal Mail]] in 2012, featuring Blake's illustrations for ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'', ''The Twits'', ''[[The Witches (novel)|The Witches]]'', ''Matilda'', ''[[Fantastic Mr Fox]]'', and ''[[James and the Giant Peach]]''.&lt;ref name="guardian royal mail stamps"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2012/jan/09/roald-dahl-stamps-classic-childrens-author | title=Roald Dahl stamps honour classic children's author |newspaper=The Guardian | date=9 January 2012 | accessdate=9 January 2012 | author=Flood, Alison | quote=Quentin Blake's famous illustrations of ''The Twits'', ''Matilda'' and ''Fantastic Mr Fox'' all feature on a new series of stamps from the Royal Mail, issued to celebrate the work of Roald Dahl.

For instance film director [[Tim Burton]] recalled from childhood "the second layer [after [[Dr. Seuss]]] of connecting to a writer who gets the idea of the modern fable – and the mixture of light and darkness, and not speaking down to kids, and the kind of politically incorrect humour that kids get.
