She was an [[orphan]], and one of the eight [[Adoption|adopted]] children of [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]].

She is recognized as the first female combat pilot by [[The Guinness Book of World Records]]&lt;ref name="First Female Combat Pilot"/&gt; and was selected as the only female pilot for the poster of "''The 20 Greatest Aviators in History''" published by the [[United States Air Force]] in 1996.&lt;ref name=trt/&gt;

== Early life ==
[[File:ZehraRukiyeSabiha.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Daughters of Mustafa Kemal; left to right: Zehra Aylin, Rukiye (Erkin) and Sabiha (Gökçen).]]
[[File:RukiyeSabihaAfetZehra.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Left to right: Rukiye (Erkin), Sabiha (Gökçen), [[Afet İnan|Afet]] (İnan), and Zehra Aylin.]] 
Sabiha Gökçen's [[Bosniak]] or [[Armenians|Armenian]] origins are a matter of some dispute. According to official Turkish sources and interviews with Sabiha Gökçen, she was the daughter of Mustafa Izzet Bey and Hayriye Hanım, both of whom were of Bosniak origin.&lt;ref name="armedia"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ataturk's Daughter was an Armenian|url=http://armedia.am/eng/news/29750/ataturks-daughter-was-an-armenian.html|website=armedia.am|accessdate=17 May 2017|language=en|date=2 November 2016|quote=According to Turkish sources and the interview with Sabiha Gokcen herself, she was born on March 22, 1913 in Bursa. She was the daughter of Mustafa İzzet Bey and Hayriye Hanim who were ethnic Bosniaks}}&lt;/ref&gt; During Atatürk's visit to [[Bursa]] in 1925, Sabiha, who was only twelve years old, asked for permission to talk with Atatürk and expressed her wish to study at a [[boarding school]]. After learning her story and about her miserable living conditions, Atatürk decided to adopt her and asked Sabiha's brother for permission to take her to the [[Çankaya Mansion|Çankaya Presidential Residence]] in [[Ankara]], where Sabiha would live with Atatürk's other adoptive daughters, Zehra, [[Afet İnan|Afet]] and Rukiye. Sabiha attended the Çankaya Primary School in [[Ankara]] and the [[Üsküdar American Academy]] in [[Istanbul]].

In February 2004 an article in the newspaper ''[[Agos]]'', headlined "The Secret of Sabiha Hatun", contained an interview with Hripsime Sebilciyan, a former resident of [[Gaziantep]], who claimed to be Gökçen's niece and that Gökçen herself was of Armenian ancestry.&lt;ref name=dink&gt;{{cite news |work=[[Agos]] |title=Sabiha Hatun'un Sırrı |first=Hrant |last=Dink |date=6 February 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mustafa Kemal had also adopted Sebilciyan, who was in an orphanage shortly after the [[Armenian Genocide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Morris |first=Chris |title=The New Turkey: The Quiet Revolution On The Edge Of Europe |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AfeZAwAAQBAJ |date=1 May 2014 |publisher=Granta Publications |isbn=978-1-78378-031-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Turkish-Armenian linguist Pars Tuğlacı, who deemed Sebilciyan's claim as false, Gökçen herself found out about her Armenian roots while in Ankara, when members of her family contacted her from [[Beirut]].&lt;ref name=hurriyet&gt;{{cite news |title=Gökçen Ermeni’ydi |url=http://arama.hurriyet.com.tr/arsivnews.aspx?id=204371 |newspaper=[[Hürriyet]] |date=22 February 2004 |language=tr}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is claimed that Gökçen visited her Armenian relatives in Beirut and had four brothers, Sarkis, Boğos, Haçik and Hovhannes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Bal |first1=Ali |title=Sabiha Gökçen et la controverse sur ses origines |url=http://www.turquie-news.com/rubriques/histoire/sabiha-gokcen-et-la-controverse,3990.html |agency=Turquie News |date=16 April 2010 |language=French |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006131026/http://www.turquie-news.com/rubriques/histoire/sabiha-gokcen-et-la-controverse,3990.html |archivedate=6 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, along with Turkish sources and interviews with Sabiha, her adopted sister [[Ülkü Adatepe]], also in an interview, disputed these claims and reiterated that Sabiha and her both parents, Mustafa İzzet Bey and Hayriye Hanım, were of Bosniak ancestry.&lt;ref name="Koser"/&gt;&lt;ref name="armedia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fatma-Ulgen-eScholarship"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fatma|first1=Ulgen,|title="Sabiha Gök̨cen's 80-year-old secret" : Kemalist nation formation and the Ottoman Armenians|url=http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2mh3z3k6#page-7|website=eScholarship|accessdate=18 May 2017|language=en|format=.pdf|date=1 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just after the introduction of the [[Surname Law]], Atatürk gave her the family name Gökçen on 19 December 1934. 'Gök' means sky in [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and Gökçen means 'belonging or relating to the sky'. However, she was not an aviator at that time,&lt;ref name="TurkishAirForce"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hvkk.tsk.tr/tr/IcerikDetay.aspx?ID=34&amp;IcerikID=86 |title=Dünyanın İlk Kadın Savaş Pilotu: Sabiha Gökçen |trans-title=The world's first female combat pilot: Sabiha Gökçen |work=Türk Hava Kuvvetleri |year=2014 |accessdate=17 November 2014 |language=tr |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006181638/http://www.hvkk.tsk.tr/tr/IcerikDetay.aspx?ID=34&amp;IcerikID=86 |archivedate=6 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Atatürk |first=Kemal |title=Atatürk'ün bütün eserleri |trans-title=Ataturk's Complete Works |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p49AAQAAIAAJ|volume=27 |date=1 January 1998 |publisher=Kaynak Yayınları |isbn=978-975-343-235-1 |page=109 |language=tr }}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was only six months later that Sabiha developed a passion for flying.

==Career==
[[File:Sabiha Gokcen with cap.jpg|thumb|right|Sabiha Gökçen with officers.]]
[[File:Sabiha Gokcen in Athens.jpg|thumb|left|Sabiha Gökçen in [[Athens]], during her 1938 [[Balkans|Balkan]] tour.]]
Atatürk attached great importance to [[aviation]] and for that purpose oversaw the foundation of the [[Turkish Aeronautical Association]] in 1925. He took Sabiha along with him to the opening ceremony of ''Türkkuşu'' (''Turkishbird'') ''Flight School'' on 5 May 1935. During the [[airshow]] of [[Glider aircraft|gliders]] and [[Parachute|parachutists]] invited from foreign countries, she got very excited. As Atatürk asked her whether she would also want to become a skydiver, she nodded "yes indeed, I am ready right now". Atatürk instructed Fuat Bulca, the head of the school, to enroll her as the first female trainee. She was meant to become a [[skydiver]], but she was much more interested in flying, so she earned her [[pilot's licence]]. Gökçen was sent to [[Russia]], together with seven male students, for an advanced course in glider and powered aircraft piloting. However, when she was in Moscow, she learned the news that Zehra had died, and with collapsed morale, she immediately returned to Turkey, isolating herself from social activities for some time.

As girls were not being accepted by the [[Turkish War Academies]] in those years, Sabiha Gökçen was provided, on Atatürk's orders, with a personalized uniform, and attended a special education programme of eleven months at the ''Tayyare Mektebi'' (Aviation School) in [[Eskişehir]] in the academic year 1936-1937. After receiving her flight patents (diploma) she trained to become a war pilot at the 1st Airplane Regiment in Eskişehir for six months.

She improved her skills by flying bomber and fighter planes at the 1st Aircraft Regiment in [[Eskişehir Province|Eskişehir]] Airbase and got experience after participating in the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] and [[Thrace]] exercises in 1937. In that same year, she took part in the [[Dersim rebellion]] and became the first Turkish female air force combat pilot. A report of the General Staff mentioned the "serious damage" that had been caused by her 50&amp;nbsp;kg bomb to a group of fifty fleeing "bandits"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Reşat |last=Hallı |title=Türkiye Cumhuriyetinde Ayaklanmalar (1924–1938) |trans-title=The Rebellions in the Republic of Turkey, 1924-1938 |publisher=T. C. Genelkurmay Baskanlığı Harp Tarihi Dairesi |year=1972 |page=382 |language=tr }}&lt;/ref&gt; and she was awarded with a ''takdirname'' (letter of appreciation). She was also awarded the [[Turkish Aeronautical Association]]'s first "''Murassa'' (Jeweled) Medal" for her superior performance in this operation.&lt;ref name="TurkishAirForce"/&gt;

In 1938, she carried out a five-day flight around the [[Balkan]] countries to great acclaim. In the same year, she was appointed "chief trainer" of the [[Türkkuşu Flight School]] of the [[Turkish Aeronautical Association]], where she served until 1954 as a flight instructor&lt;ref name="TurkishAirForce"/&gt; and became a member of the association's executive board. She trained four female aviators, Edibe Subaşı, Yıldız Uçman, Sahavet Karapas and [[Nezihe Viranyalı]]. Sabiha Gökçen flew around the world for a period of 28 years until 1964. Her book entitled "''A Life Along the Path of Atatürk''" was published in 1981 by the Turkish Aeronautical Association to commemorate Atatürk's 100th birthday.

Throughout her career in the [[Turkish Air Force]], Gökçen flew 22 different types of aircraft for more than 8,000 hours, 32 hours of which were active combat and bombardment missions.&lt;ref name=trt&gt;{{YouTube|id=m-hv6MfohTs#t=9m30s|title=TRT documentary on Sabiha Gökçen}}. See 9m30s in for 1996 USAF poster claim.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==
[[File:Atatürk, Ali Çetinkaya and Sabiha Gökçen in Diyarbakır.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Atatürk, [[Ali Çetinkaya]] and Sabiha Gökçen in [[Diyarbakır]].]]

Gökçen made headlines and sparked controversy, in 2004, when [[Hrant Dink]], a journalist of Turkish-Armenian descent, published an interview with a person claiming to be Sabiha's niece that claimed that she was of [[Armenians|Armenian]] origin. Many contested the matter, including her adopted sister and last living daughter of Atatürk, [[Ülkü Adatepe]], disputing this during an interview and stating that Sabiha was of [[Bosniaks|Bosniak]] ancestry.&lt;ref name="Koser"&gt;{{cite news

|quote = In February, the Hurriyet newspaper's publication of a report that Sabiha Gokcen--an adopted daughter of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, who was the country's first female pilot--was of Armenian descent drew a number of racist public statements. The Turkish General Staff issued a statement criticizing the reports on Gokcen's Armenian ancestry as 'a claim that abuses national values and feelings' while the Turkish Air Association called the report 'an insult' to Gokcen and to Ataturk.
