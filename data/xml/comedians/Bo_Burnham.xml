==Career==
[[File:BoBurnham.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Burnham performing at [[The Improv]] in September 2008]]

In 2006, Burnham videotaped himself performing two songs and posted them on [[YouTube]] to share with his family.&lt;ref name="wired20080611"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://blog.wired.com/underwire/2008/06/bedroom-comedia.html |title=YouTube Star Bo Burnham Readies Debut EP, ''Bo Fo Sho'' |accessdate=January 25, 2009 |last=Wortham |first=Jenna |date=June 11, 2008 |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612065311/http://blog.wired.com/underwire/2008/06/bedroom-comedia.html |archivedate=June 12, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; They quickly became popular through YouTube, [[Break.com]], and other sites.&lt;ref name="tbg20080213" /&gt;

Accompanying himself on [[guitar]] or [[digital piano]], Burnham continued to release self-described "pubescent musical comedy"&lt;ref name="wired20080611" /&gt; songs and videos online as his audience grew.  Described in ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' as "simultaneously wholesome and disturbing, intimate in a folksy-creepy sort of way", Burnham wrote and released songs about [[white supremacy]], [[Helen Keller]]'s disabilities, [[homosexuality]], and more.&lt;ref name="tbg20080213" /&gt; All of Burnham's home-released videos were self-recorded in and around his family's home in [[Hamilton, Massachusetts]], most in his bedroom,&lt;ref name="tbg20080213" /&gt;&lt;ref name="thr20080925" /&gt; and had an intentional "do-it-yourself [feel], almost like voyeurism".&lt;ref name="TAVC"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Bo Burnham |first=Steve |last=Heisler |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/bo-burnham,26195/ |newspaper=[[The A.V.

Burnham's music and performances tackle such subjects as [[race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[gender]], [[human sexuality]], [[sex]], and [[religion]].&lt;ref name="TBG20090309"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.bostonherald.com/entertainment/arts_culture/view/2009_03_09_Bo-dacious_comedy:_Hamilton_s_Burnham_moves_from_the_bedroom_to_Hollywood/srvc=home&amp;position=also |title=Bo-dacious comedy: Hamilton’s Burnham moves from the bedroom to Hollywood |last=Gottlieb |first=Jed |date=March 9, 2009 |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |accessdate=March 9, 2009 |publisher=P.

Burnham's first experience with controversy regarding his music came on March 3, 2009, when fifteen [[Westminster College (Missouri)|Westminster College]] students (members of the campus' [[Gay-Straight Alliance]], Black Students Association, International Club, and Cultural Diversity Organization) protested his concert there that evening.  &lt;!-- Though Burnham is playing characters in his performances, to make it comedy, that line has to be a thin one. --&gt; Of the controversy, he said, "It's so ironic because [[gay bashing|gay bashers]] were the ones labeling me in high school ... I try and write satire that's well-intentioned.  But those intentions have to be hidden.  It can't be completely clear and that's what makes it comedy." Despite the college's admission that they had booked Burnham while ignorant of his show's material, dean of students John Comerford praised the opportunities for discourse the controversy brought the school.&lt;ref name="TBG20090309" /&gt;&lt;ref name="20090304CDT"&gt;{{Cite news |first=T.J. |last=Greaney |title=In-your-face comedy |url=http://www.columbiatribune.com/news/2009/mar/04/in-your-face-comedy/ |work=[[Columbia Daily Tribune]] |date=March 4, 2009 |accessdate=March 9, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309193520/http://www.columbiatribune.com/news/2009/mar/04/in-your-face-comedy/ |archivedate=March 9, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 21, 2010, Burnham taped his first one-hour stand-up special, entitled ''[[Words Words Words]]'', for [[Comedy Central]] from the [[House of Blues]] in [[Boston]] as part of the network's new "House of Comedy" series of stand-up specials; it aired on Comedy Central on October 16, 2010. It was released on October 18, 2010.

[[File:Bo Burnham in Pittsburgh (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Burnham performing in [[Pittsburgh]] in April 2012]]

While performing at the [[Montreal]] [[Just for Laughs]] festival in 2008,&lt;ref name="nydn20080726" /&gt; Burnham met with director and producer [[Judd Apatow]]. That September, Burnham negotiated with Universal Pictures to write and create the music for an Apatow-produced comedy film which he describes as the "anti-''[[High School Musical]]''",&lt;ref name="thr20080925" /&gt;&lt;ref name="independent20081114"&gt;{{Cite news |first=Julian |last=Hall |title=Rising Star: Bo Burnham, comedy actor |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/comedy/features/rising-star-bo-burnham-comedy-actor-1017559.html |work=[[The Independent]] |publisher=[[Independent News &amp; Media]] |date=November 14, 2008 |accessdate=January 25, 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090712000243/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/comedy/features/rising-star-bo-burnham-comedy-actor-1017559.html |archivedate=July 12, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; although Burnham insists the script is not a parody of the [[Disney]] musicals, but an attempt to emulate the high school he attended. Hoping to star in the film he was writing, Burnham told [[Wired (magazine)|''Wired'']] magazine that he named the star "Bo" in a "not-so-subtle hint [he] want[s] to be in it".&lt;ref name="Wired20081001"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Wortham |first=Jenna |date=October 1, 2008 |title=YouTuber Bo Burnham Scripting New Judd Apatow Movie |journal=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |accessdate=May 30, 2009 |url=https://www.wired.com/underwire/2008/10/youtuber-bo-bur/ |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531031409/http://www.wired.com/underwire/2008/10/youtuber-bo-bur |archivedate=May 31, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a March 2009 interview with ''[[Boston's Weekly Dig]]'', Burnham elaborated on his work with the film.
