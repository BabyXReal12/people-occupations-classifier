'''Carol Creighton Burnett''' (born April 26, 1933) is an American actress, comedian, singer and writer, whose career spans seven decades of television. She is best known for her groundbreaking television variety show, ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]'', originally aired on [[CBS]]. It was the first of its kind to be hosted by a woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://parade.com/451837/amyspencer/carol-burnett-first-woman-of-comedy/|title=Carol Burnett: First Woman of Comedy|last=Spencer|first=Amy|work=[[Parade (magazine)|Parade]]|publisher=[[Athlon Media Group]]|date=January 22, 2016|accessdate=July 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has achieved success on stage, television and film in varying genres including dramatic and comedy roles. She has also appeared on various talk shows and as a panelist on game shows.

Born in [[San Antonio]], [[Texas]], Burnett moved with her grandmother to Hollywood, where she attended [[Hollywood High School]] and eventually studied theater and musical comedy at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]]. Later she performed in nightclubs in New York City and had a breakout success on Broadway in 1959 in ''[[Once Upon a Mattress]]'', for which she received a [[Tony Award]] nomination. She soon made her television debut, regularly appearing on ''[[The Garry Moore Show]]'' for the next three years, and won her first [[Emmy Award]] in 1962. Burnett had her television special debut in 1963 when she starred as Calamity Jane in the Dallas State Fair Musicals production of ''[[Calamity Jane]]'' on [[CBS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Billboard| date=29 July 1963 |volume=75 |issue=26| page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burnett moved to [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], and began an 11-year run as star of ''The Carol Burnett Show'' on [[CBS]] television from 1967 to 1978. With its [[vaudeville]] roots, ''The Carol Burnett Show'' was a [[variety show]] that combined [[sketch comedy|comedy sketches]] with song and dance. The comedy sketches included [[parody|film parodies]] and character pieces. Burnett created many memorable characters during the show's run, and both she and the show won numerous [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] and [[Golden Globe Award]]s.

During and after her variety show, Burnett appeared in many television and film projects. Her film roles include ''[[Pete 'n' Tillie]]'' (1972),  ''[[The Front Page (1974 film)|The Front Page]]'' (1974), ''[[The Four Seasons (1981 film)|The Four Seasons]]'' (1981), ''[[Annie (1982 film)|Annie]]'' (1982), ''[[Noises Off (film)|Noises Off]]'' (1992), and ''[[Horton Hears a Who! (film)|Horton Hears a Who!]]'' (2008). On television, she has appeared in other sketch shows; in dramatic roles in ''[[6 Rms Riv Vu]]'' (1974) and ''[[Friendly Fire (1979 film)|Friendly Fire]]'' (1979); in various well-regarded guest roles, such as in ''[[Mad About You]],'' for which she won an Emmy Award; and in specials with [[Julie Andrews]], [[Dolly Parton]], [[Beverly Sills]], and others. She returned to the Broadway stage in 1995 in ''[[Moon Over Buffalo]],'' for which she was again nominated for a [[Tony Award]].

Burnett has written and narrated several [[memoir]]s, earning [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] nominations for almost all of them, and a win for ''[[In Such Good Company|In Such Good Company: Eleven Years Of Laughter, Mayhem, And Fun In The Sandbox]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/carol-burnett|title=Artist Carol Burnett|website=www.grammy.com|accessdate=July 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-ms-grammys-2017-nominations-winners-list-20161205-story.html |title=2017 Grammy Awards: Complete list of nominees |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=February 12, 2017|accessdate=August 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
In 2005, she was recognized as "one of America's most cherished entertainers" and awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] "for enhancing the lives of millions of Americans and for her extraordinary contributions to American entertainment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|date=November 9, 2005 |title= Citations for Recipients of the 2005 Presidential Medal of Freedom |url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2005/11/20051109-10.html|location=Washington, DC|publisher=The White House|agency= Office of the Press Secretary|access-date=June 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her parents divorced in the late 1930s, and she and her grandmother moved to an apartment near her mother’s in an impoverished area of [[Hollywood]], [[California]]. There they stayed in a [[boarding house]] with Burnett's younger half-sister Chrissie.&lt;ref&gt;[http://carolburnettfan.com/biography.html Carol Burnett Fan&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821072438/http://carolburnettfan.com/biography.html |date=August 21, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When Burnett was in second grade, she briefly invented an [[imaginary friend|imaginary]] twin sister named Karen, with [[Shirley Temple]]-like dimples. She later recalled that, motivated to further the pretense, she "fooled the other boarders in the rooming house where we lived by frantically switching clothes and dashing in and out of the house by the fire escape and the front door. Then I became exhausted and Karen mysteriously vanished."{{sfn|Downs|1971|pages=93–97}} Burnett's first experiences with singing occurred with her family. Her grandmother was a trained musician who could play the piano (although they didn't have one at the time), and her mother played a ukulele, so they would sometimes sing popular songs in harmony together around the kitchen table.&lt;ref name="PBSMasters"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/carol-burnett-the-carol-burnett-interview/90/|title=Carol Burnett: A Woman of Character|last=Thompson|first=Kyra|work=[[American Masters]]|date=August 24, 2008|accessdate=June 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her grandmother would frequently take Burnett and her sister to the movies - as well as take a few rolls of toilet paper home from the theater.&lt;ref name= "Superstardom"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://people.com/tv/carol-burnett-from-poverty-to-superstardom/|title=Anonymous Strangers Helped Carol Burnett Go from Poverty to Superstardom|last=Heyman |first=J.

[[File:Hollywood Pacific Theater 2010.JPG|thumb|Hollywood Pacific Theatre in 2010, site of Burnett's star]]
For a while, she worked as an usherette at the Warner Brothers Theater (now the [[Hollywood Pacific Theatre]]). When the cinema screened [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Strangers on a Train (film)|Strangers on a Train]]'' (1951), having already seen the film and loving it, she advised two patrons arriving during the last five minutes of a showing to wait until the beginning of the next showing to avoid spoiling the ending for them, but the couple insisted on being seated. The manager observed Burnett not letting the couple in, then callously fired her, stripping the [[epaulette]]s from her uniform on the spot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/carol-burnett#| title=Interview: Carol Burnett| publisher=Archive of American Television| date=29 April 2003| last=Herman| first=Karen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Years later in the 1970s after achieving TV stardom, when the [[Hollywood]] [[Chamber of commerce]] offered her a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]], they asked her where she wanted it. She replied "Right in front of where the old Warner Brothers Theater was, at Hollywood and Wilcox", which is where it was placed,&lt;ref name="Ferrell"/&gt;{{sfn|Burnett|1986|pages=194–195}} at 6439 Hollywood Blvd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|title=Hollywood Walk of Fame - Locations|url=http://www.seeing-stars.com/immortalized/walkoffamestars.shtml|work=|publisher=|date=|accessdate=December 16, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090514085540/http://www.seeing-stars.com/Immortalized/WalkOfFameStars.shtml|archivedate=May 14, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hollywood High School, Hollywood, California (21597930841).jpg|thumb|Hollywood High School, with mural including alumna Burnett at center]]
After graduating from [[Hollywood High School]] in 1951, she received an anonymous envelope containing $50 for one year's tuition at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]], where she initially planned on studying journalism.&lt;ref name=Rehm&gt;{{cite news |url=http://thedianerehmshow.org/shows/2013-04-10/carol-burnett-carrie-and-me-mother-daughter-love-story/transcript |title=Carol Burnett: "Carrie and Me: A Mother-Daughter Love Story" |publisher=''[[The Diane Rehm Show]]'' |date=April 10, 2013 |accessdate=April 28, 2013 | first=Diane | last=Rehm}}&lt;/ref&gt; During her first year of college, she switched her focus to theatre arts and English, with the goal of becoming a playwright. She found she had to take an acting course to enter the playwright program; "I wasn't really ready to do the acting thing, but I had no choice."&lt;ref name=Star&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/comment/columnists/article/645801 |title=One laugh changed Carol Burnett's life|work=[[Toronto Star]]|publisher=[[Star Media Group]]|location=[[Toronto]]|date=June 6, 2009|accessdate=September 18, 2009 | first=Richard | last=Ouzounian}}&lt;/ref&gt; She followed a sudden impulse in her first performance; "Don't ask me why, but when we were in front of the audience, I suddenly decided I was going to stretch out all my words and my first line came out 'I'm baaaaaaaack!'"&lt;ref name=Star/&gt; The audience response moved her deeply:

{{cquote|They laughed and it felt great. All of a sudden, after so much coldness and emptiness in my life, I knew the sensation of all that warmth wrapping around me. I had always been a quiet, shy, sad sort of girl and then everything changed for me. You spend the rest of your life hoping you'll hear a laugh that great again.&lt;ref name=Star/&gt;}}

During this time, she performed in several university productions, garnering recognition for her comedic and musical abilities. Her mother disapproved of her acting ambitions:

{{cquote|She wanted me to be a writer. She said you can always write, no matter what you look like. When I was growing up she told me to be a little lady, and a couple of times I got a whack for crossing my eyes or making funny faces. Of course, she never, I never, dreamed I would ever perform.{{sfn|Downs|1971|pages=93–97}}}}

The young Burnett, always insecure about her looks, responded many years later to her mother's advice of "You can always write, no matter what you look like" by noting "God, that hurt!" in her memoir ''One More Time'' (1986).

During her junior year at UCLA in 1954, a professor invited Burnett and some other students to perform at a party in place of their class final that had been canceled (which required a performance in front of an audience). Afterwards, a man and his wife approached her while Carol was stuffing cookies in her purse to take home to her grandmother.&lt;ref name=SILive&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180711165327/https://www.silive.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2015/04/carol_burnett_on_staten_island.html|title=Carol Burnett: 10 things to know before the comedy legend plays St. George|last=Bailey|first=Rob|work=[[Staten Island Advance]]|publisher=[[Advance Publications]]|location=[[Staten Island]]|date=April 3, 2015|accessdate=July 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sun&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vancouversun.com/entertainment/story.html?id=2001007|title=Carol Burnett's comedy reign extends into dramatic role|last=Birnie|first=Peter|work=[[The Vancouver Sun]]|publisher=[[Postmedia Network]]|location=[[Vancouver]]|date=September 16, 2009|accessdate=March 23, 2011}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of reprimanding her, the man complimented her performance and asked about her future plans. When he learned that she wished to travel to New York in order to try her luck in musical comedy but couldn't afford the trip, right then and there he offered her and her boyfriend Don Saroyan each a $1,000 interest-free loan.&lt;ref name=Sun/&gt; His conditions were simply that the loans were to be repaid within five years, his name was never to be revealed, and if she achieved  success, she would help other aspiring talents to pursue their artistic dreams.&lt;ref name=Sun/&gt; Burnett took him up on his offer; she and Saroyan left college and moved to New York to pursue acting careers. That same year, her father died of causes related to his alcoholism.&lt;ref name= "Heartbreak"&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20136340,00.html|title=Another Heartbreak|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]|last=Smolowe |first=Jill |volume=57|issue=4|date=February 4, 2002|accessdate=August 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Early career===
After spending her first year in New York working as a hat-check girl and failing to land acting jobs, Burnett along with other girls living at the [[Rehearsal Club (New York City)|Rehearsal Club]], a boarding house for women seriously pursuing an acting career, put on ''The Rehearsal Club Revue'' on March 3, 1955. They mailed invitations to agents, who showed up along with stars like [[Celeste Holm]] and [[Marlene Dietrich]], and this opened doors for several of the girls. She was cast in a minor role on ''The [[Paul Winchell]] and Jerry Mahoney Show'' in 1955. She played the girlfriend of a ventriloquist’s dummy on the popular children’s program. This role led to her starring role opposite [[Buddy Hackett]] in the short-lived sitcom ''[[Stanley (1956 TV series)|Stanley]]'' from 1956 to 1957.

[[File:Carol burnett garry moore 1960.JPG|thumb|right|Burnett and Larry Blyden from ''The Garry Moore Show'', 1960]]
After ''Stanley'', Burnett found herself unemployed for a short time. She eventually bounced back a few months later as a highly popular performer on the New York circuit of cabarets and night clubs, most notably for a hit parody number called "I Made a Fool of Myself Over [[John Foster Dulles]]" (Dulles was [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] at the time). In 1957, she performed this number on both ''[[The Tonight Show]]'', hosted by [[Jack Paar]], and ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]''. Dulles was asked about her on ''[[Meet the Press]]'' and joked,  “I never discuss matters of the heart in public.”&lt;ref name=MTprize/&gt;

She also worked as a regular on one of television's earliest game shows, ''[[Pantomime Quiz]]'', during this time. In 1957, just as she was achieving her first small successes, her mother died.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}&lt;del&gt;&lt;/del&gt;

Burnett's first true taste of success came with her appearance on Broadway in the 1959 musical ''[[Once Upon a Mattress]]'', for which she was nominated for a [[Tony Award]]. The same year, she became a regular player on ''[[The Garry Moore Show]]'', a job that lasted until 1962. She won an [[Emmy Award]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/carol-burnett|title=Carol Burnett Emmy Winner|publisher=The Emmys|accessdate=December 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; that year for her "Outstanding Performance in a Variety or Musical Program or Series" on the show. She portrayed a number of characters, most memorably the put-upon cleaning woman who would later become her signature alter-ego. With her success on the ''Moore Show'', Burnett finally rose to headliner status and appeared in the special ''[[Julie and Carol at Carnegie Hall]]'' (1962), co-starring with her friend [[Julie Andrews]]. The show was produced by [[Bob Banner]], directed by [[Joe Hamilton (producer)|Joe Hamilton]], and written by [[Mike Nichols]] and Ken Welch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/How-Sweet-Was-Television-Commentary/dp/B000VMS8D8|last1=Shulman|first1=Arthur|last2=Youman|first2=Roger|title=How Sweet it Was: Television- A Pictorial Commentary|year=1966|publisher=[[Crown Publishing Group#Imprints|Bonanza Books]]|location=[[New York City]]|edition=Reprint|isbn=978-0517081358|asin=B000VMS8D8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{ref|1|1}} ''Julie and Carol at Carnegie Hall'' won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Program Achievement in the Field of Music, and Burnett won an Emmy for her performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/content/julie-and-carol-carnegie-hall-and-carol-and-com|title=Julie and Carol at Carnegie Hall AND Carol and Com|website=www.emmys.com|accessdate=July 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also guest-starred on a number of shows during this time, including ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'' episode "[[Cavender Is Coming]]".

In 1964, Burnett starred in the Broadway musical ''[[Fade Out – Fade In]]'' but was forced to withdraw after sustaining a neck injury in a taxi accident. She returned to the show later but withdrew again to participate in a variety show, ''[[The Entertainers]]'', opposite [[Caterina Valente]] and [[Bob Newhart]]. The producers of ''Fade Out – Fade In'' sued the actress for breach of contract after her absences from the popular show caused its failure, but the suit was later dropped. ''The Entertainers'' ran for only one season.{{sfn|Suskin|2006|pages=90–93}}

Around the same time, she became good friends with [[Jim Nabors]], who was enjoying great success with his series ''[[Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.]]'' As a result of their close friendship, she played a recurring role on Nabors' show as a tough corporal, later [[gunnery sergeant]] (starting with the episode [[Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C. (season 4)#Episodes|"Corporal Carol"]]). Nabors would later be her first guest every season on her variety show, as she considered him to be her good luck charm. He also became the godfather to her daughter Jody.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/newswires/entertainment/notable-reaction-death-actor-singer-jim-nabors-article-1.3668644|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180712000337/http://www.nydailynews.com/newswires/entertainment/notable-reaction-death-actor-singer-jim-nabors-article-1.3668644|archive-date=July 11, 2018|title=Notable reaction to the death of actor-singer Jim Nabors |work=[[New York Daily News]]|publisher=[[Tronc]]|author=[[Associated Press]]|date=November 30, 2017|accessdate=July 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, [[Lucille Ball]] became a friend and mentor to Burnett. After having guested on Burnett's highly successful CBS-TV special ''[[Carol + 2]]'' and having the younger performer reciprocate by appearing on ''[[The Lucy Show]],'' Ball reportedly offered Burnett her own sitcom called "Here's Agnes," to be produced by [[Desilu Productions]]. She declined the offer, not wanting to commit herself to a weekly series. The two remained close friends until Ball's death in 1989. Ball sent flowers every year on Burnett's birthday. When Burnett awoke on the day of her 56th birthday in 1989, she discovered via the morning news that Lucille Ball had died. Later that afternoon, flowers arrived at Burnett's house with a note reading, "Happy Birthday, Kid. Love, Lucy."&lt;ref name="MitchellFink"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fink|first=Mitchell|title=The Last Days of Dead Celebrities|url=https://www.amazon.com/Last-Days-Dead-Celebrities/dp/1401360254|year=2007|publisher=[[Miramax Books]]|location=[[New York City]]|isbn=978-1401360252}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, CBS offered to put Burnett in a weekly comedy series called ''Here's Agnes''. However, she had a stipulation in her ten-year contract with CBS that said she had five years from the date ''The Garry Moore Show'' ended to "push the button" on hosting thirty one-hour episodes of a music/comedy variety show. As a result, the hour-long ''Carol Burnett Show'' was born and debuted in September 1967, garnering 23 [[Emmy Award]]s and winning or being nominated for multiple Emmy and [[Golden Globe Award]]s every season it was on the air. Its ensemble cast included [[Tim Conway]] (who was a guest player until the ninth season),&lt;ref name="ET"&gt;Interview on ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]''. [[New York City]]: [[CBS Television Distribution]]. Retrieved May 22, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harvey Korman]], [[Lyle Waggoner]], and the teenaged [[Vicki Lawrence]], whom Burnett herself discovered and mentored. The network initially did not want her to do a variety show because they believed only men could be successful at variety, but her contract required that they give her one season of whatever kind of show she wanted to make.&lt;ref name ="LAT"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/oct/10/entertainment/ca-34154?s=g&amp;n=n&amp;m=Broad&amp;rd=www.google.com&amp;tnid=1&amp;sessid=ad58030466016a68964a5a2cf0fc4737e8af7121&amp;uuid=ad58030466016a68964a5a2cf0fc4737e8af7121&amp;pgtp=article&amp;eagi=&amp;cat=entertainment&amp;page_type=article&amp;exci=2000_10_10_entertainment_ca-34154&amp;pg=1|title='Carol Burnett' Videos Put Shows Back Together|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=October 10, 2000|first=Susan|publisher=[[Tribune Media|Tribune Company]] (2000–14) [[tronc|Tronc, Inc.]] (2014–present)|location=[[Los Angeles]]|last=King}}&lt;/ref&gt; She chose to carry on the tradition of past variety show successes.

A true variety show, ''The Carol Burnett Show'' struck a chord with viewers. Among other things, it parodied films ("Went With the Wind" for ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone With the Wind]]''), television ("As the Stomach Turns" for the soap opera ''[[As the World Turns]]'') and commercials. Musical numbers were also a frequent feature. Burnett and her team struck gold with the original sketch "The Family", which eventually was spun off into its own television show called ''[[Mama's Family]]'', starring [[Vicki Lawrence]].

She opened most shows with an impromptu question-and-answer session with the audience, lasting a few minutes, during which she often demonstrated her ability to humorously ad lib. On numerous occasions, she obliged when asked to perform her trademark&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://allday.today.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2008/03/12/4378081-carol-burnetts-tarzan-yell |title=Carol Burnett's Tarzan Yell |publisher=allDAY on ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]]'' |date=March 12, 2008 |accessdate=February 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tarzan yell]].

She ended each show by tugging on her left ear, which was a message to her grandmother who raised her. This was done to let her know that she was doing well and that she loved her. During the show's run, her grandmother died. On an ''[[Intimate Portrait]]'' episode on Burnett, she tearfully recalled her grandmother's last moments: "She said to my husband Joe from her hospital bed 'Joe, you see that spider up there?' There was no spider, but Joe said he did anyhow. She said 'Every few minutes a big spider jumps on that little spider and they go at it like rabbits!!' And then she died. There's laughter in everything!"&lt;ref&gt;[[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime Channel]]'s ''Intimate Portrait'' episode on Burnett&lt;/ref&gt; She continued the tradition of tugging her ear.

''The Carol Burnett Show'' ceased production in 1978, Four post-script episodes were produced and aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] during the summer of 1979 under the title, ''[[Carol Burnett &amp; Company]]'' basically using the same format and, with the exception of Harvey Korman and Lyle Waggoner, the same supporting cast. Beginning in 1977, the comedy sketches of her series were edited into half-hour episodes for syndication entitled ''[[Carol Burnett and Friends]]'', which, for many years, proved to be extremely popular in syndication, and in January 2015, it began airing on [[MeTV]].

The show's enduring popularity surprised many when a 2001 retrospective containing outtakes and discussions with the cast, and a tribute to Bob Mackie, drew in 30 million viewers, topping the Emmy Awards as well as all but the final game of that year's [[World Series]].&lt;ref name= "Heartbreak" /&gt;

Her Grammy-winning memoir ''In Such Good Company'' is about the show, and Burnett tells about how it was developed, with anecdotes about improvisations, the cast, crew, and guests.

===Other roles===
[[File:Carol Burnett - 1974.jpg|right|thumb|Burnett in 1974]]
Burnett starred in a few films while her variety show was running, including ''[[Pete 'n' Tillie]]'' (1972). She was nominated for an Emmy in 1974 for her role in the drama ''[[6 Rms Riv Vu]]''. After her show ended, she assumed a number of roles that departed from comedy. She appeared in several dramatic roles, most notably in the television movie ''[[Friendly Fire (1979 film)|Friendly Fire]]''. She appeared as Beatrice O'Reilly in the film ''Life of The Party: The Story of Beatrice'', a story about a woman fighting her alcoholism. Her other film work includes ''[[The Four Seasons (1981 film)|The Four Seasons]]'' (1981), ''[[Annie (1982 film)|Annie]]'' (1982), and ''[[Noises Off (film)|Noises Off]]'' (1992). She also returned in 2005 to star in a different role as Queen Aggravain in the movie version of ''Once Upon a Mattress''. She guest-starred in season two of ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'' as Bree's stepmother, Elanor Mason.

Burnett was the first celebrity to appear on the children's series ''[[Sesame Street]]'', on that series' first episode on November 10, 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0698422/?ref_=ttep_ep2|title=Sesame Street Episode #1.1 |author= IMDB|date=|work=|accessdate=April 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also made occasional returns to the stage in the 1970s and 1980s. In 1974, she appeared at [[the Muny]] Theatre in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], in ''[[I Do! I Do!]]'' with [[Rock Hudson]], and eleven years later, she took the supporting role of Carlotta Campion in the 1985 concert performance of [[Stephen Sondheim]]'s ''[[Follies]]''. She made frequent appearances as a panelist on the game show ''[[Password (game show)|Password]]'', an association she maintained until the early 1980s (in fact, [[Mark Goodson]] awarded her his Silver Password All-Stars Award for best celebrity player; she's also credited with coming up with the title ''[[Password Plus]]'', when it was originally planned to be titled ''Password '79'').

In the 1980s and 1990s, she made several attempts at starting a new variety program. She also appeared briefly on ''The Carol Burnett Show's'' "[[The Family (sketch)|The Family]]" sketches spinoff, ''[[Mama's Family]]'', as her stormy character, [[Eunice Higgins]]. She played the matriarch in the [[cult following|cult]] comedy miniseries ''[[Fresno (TV miniseries)|Fresno]]'', which parodied the primetime soap opera ''[[Falcon Crest]]''. She returned to TV in the mid-1990s as a supporting character on the sitcom ''[[Mad About You]]'', playing Theresa Stemple, the mother of main character Jamie Buchman ([[Helen Hunt]]), for which she won another Emmy Award. In 1995, after an absence of 30 years, she was back on Broadway in ''[[Moon Over Buffalo]]'', for which she was nominated for a [[Tony Award]]. Four years later, she appeared in the Broadway revue ''[[Putting It Together]]''.

Burnett had long been a fan of the soap opera ''[[All My Children]]'', and realized a dream when [[Agnes Nixon]] created the role of Verla Grubbs for her in 1976. Burnett played the long-lost daughter of Langley Wallingford ([[Louis Edmonds]]), causing trouble for her stepmother Phoebe Tyler-Wallingford ([[Ruth Warrick]]). She made occasional appearances on the soap opera in each decade thereafter. She hosted a 25th-anniversary special about the show in 1995 and made a brief [[cameo appearance]] as Verla Grubbs on the January 5, 2005, episode which celebrated the show's 35th anniversary. She reprised her role as Grubbs in September 2011 as part of the series' finale.

In 2008, she had her second role as an animated character in the film ''[[Horton Hears a Who! (film)|Horton Hears a Who!]]''. Her first was in ''The Trumpet of the Swan'' in 2001. In 2009, she made a guest appearance on the ''[[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit]]'', for which she was nominated for the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress – Drama Series|Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series]]. In November 2010, she guest-starred on [[Furt|an episode]] of ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]'' as the mother of cheerleading coach [[Sue Sylvester]].&lt;ref name="Hetrick"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/141786-Glee-Nabs-Carol-Burnett-as-Sue-Sylvesters-Mom|title="Glee" Nabs Carol Burnett as Sue Sylvester's Mom|first=Adam|last=Hetrick|date=August 4, 2010|work=[[Playbill]]|publisher=TotalTheater|location=[[New York City]]|accessdate=August 4, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100807121020/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/141786-Glee-Nabs-Carol-Burnett-as-Sue-Sylvesters-Mom|archivedate=August 7, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 she had another voice role in ''[[The Secret World of Arrietty]]''.

==Personal life==
Burnett married her college sweetheart Don Saroyan on December 15, 1955; they divorced in 1962.

On May 4, 1963, she married TV producer [[Joe Hamilton (producer)|Joe Hamilton]], a divorced father of eight, who had produced her 1962 Carnegie Hall concert and would produce ''The Carol Burnett Show,'' among other projects.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news | title=Joe Hamilton, 62, a Top Producer Of Television Specials, Is Dead | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE4DC1638F931A25755C0A967958260|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|location=[[New York City]]|first=Glenn|last=Fowler|date=June 12, 1991|accessdate=April 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had three daughters:

* [[Erin Hamilton]], born {{birth date and age|1968|8|14|mf=yes}}. She is a singer.

Their marriage ended in divorce in 1984. The challenge of coping with Carrie's drug problems was mentioned as part of the reason for the separation, but the couple took the opportunity to inform other parents about handling such problems and raised money for the clinic in which Carrie was treated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/jan/21/local/me-carrie21|title=Carrie Hamilton, 38; Drug Fight Publicized|last=Oliver|first=Myrna|publisher=[[LA Times]]|date=January 21, 2002|accessdate=June 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, Burnett and Carrie took a trip to [[Moscow]] to help introduce the first [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] branch in the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name= "Heartbreak" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-11-01/news/mn-621_1_alcoholics-anonymous|title=Alcoholics Anonymous:Soviets Try Proven Cure for Drinking|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|last=Parks|first=Michael|date=November 1, 1988|accessdate=August 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joe Hamilton died of cancer in 1991.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

On November 24, 2001, she married Brian Miller, principal drummer in and contractor of the [[Hollywood Bowl Orchestra]], who is 23 years her junior.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bravotv.com/blogs/hollywood-cougars-who-found-true-love-with-a-much-much-younger-partner&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Heartbreak" /&gt;

She was good friends with [[Lucille Ball]], [[Beverly Sills]] and [[Jim Nabors]], and remains good friends with [[Julie Andrews]] and [[Betty White]]. She is the acting mentor to her protégée [[Vicki Lawrence]]. They share a close friendship, as noted by Lawrence in a testimonial speech during her appearance at Burnett's 2013 Mark Twain Award in Washington, D.C. (recorded and broadcast on PBS Television).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonian.com/2013/10/21/carol-burnett-honored-by-tina-fey-amy-poehler-and-other-stars-at-kennedy-center-laughfest-photos/|title=Carol Burnett Honored by Tina Fey, Amy Poehler, and Other Stars at Kennedy Center Laughfest (Photos) {{!}} Washingtonian|date=October 21, 2013|work=Washingtonian|access-date=April 29, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2003 interview with [[Terry Gross]] on ''[[Fresh Air]]'', Burnett said that both she and her daughter Jody had corrective dental surgery. Burnett had an [[overbite]] resulting in a weak chin, and her daughter had an [[Malocclusion|underbite]]. After consulting the oral surgeon about Jody's bite, he said he could repair hers as well, giving her more of a chin, so both of them got operations. Prior to this, Burnett had worked on the 1982 film [[Annie (1982 film)|Annie]] and was called back to reshoot part of a scene after having recovered from the surgery. The scene involved her character entering and exiting a closet to retrieve a necklace. She told the director, [[John Huston]], that she was concerned about her chin looking different from entering the closet to exiting it, and he simply told her to "look determined". The scene is still in the film.&lt;ref name= "NPRMattress"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5056760|title=Carol Burnett Returns to the 'Mattress'|last=Gross |first=Terry |work=Fresh Air|publisher=[[NPR]]|date=October 13, 2003|accessdate=August 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In keeping with her promise to the anonymous benefactor who assisted her in 1954, she has contributed to scholarship programs at [[UCLA]] and the [[University of Hawaii]] to help people in financial need.&lt;ref name="Beloved"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-10-13/entertainment/ca-2963_1_carol-burnett/2|title=A Beloved Comedienne Returns |last=Christon |first=Lawrence |publisher=[[LA Times]]|date=October 13, 1986|accessdate=June 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Libel case==
{{main|Burnett v. National Enquirer, Inc.}}

In 1976, a false report in the nation's leading supermarket [[tabloid journalism|tabloid]], ''[[The National Enquirer]],'' incorrectly implied that Burnett had been drunk and boisterous in public at a restaurant with U.S. Secretary of State [[Henry Kissinger]] in attendance. The fact that both of her parents suffered from alcoholism made this a particularly sensitive issue to her.  Through years of persistent litigation, she won a judgment against the ''Enquirer'', in 1981.  Though the initial jury award of $1.6 million was reduced to $200,000 by a series of appeals, and the final settlement was out-of-court, the event was widely viewed as a historic victory for libel victims of [[tabloid journalism]].&lt;ref name="carol_burnett_launches_1981_03_22_upi"&gt;Scott, Vernon, [http://www.upi.com/Archives/1981/03/22/Carol-Burnett-launches-trial-balloon/6032354085200/ "Carol Burnett launches trial balloon,"], March 22, 1981, ''[[United Press International]] (UPI),'' retrieved January 1, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="carol_burnett_given_1981_03_27_lindsey_nytimes"&gt;Lindsey, Robert, [https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/27/us/carol-burnett-given-1.6-million-in-suit-against-national-enquirer.html "Carol Burnett given 1.6 million in suit against National Enquirer,"], March 27, 1981, ''[[The New York Times]],'' retrieved January 1, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="how_tabloids_1991_01_04_nytimes"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/04/news/how-the-supermarket-tabloids-stay-out-of-court.html "How the Supermarket Tabloids Stay Out of Court,"] January 4, 1991, ''[[The New York Times]],'' retrieved January 1, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tabloids_lies_1991_08_12_langberg_nytimes"&gt;Langberg, Barry (libel attorney for Carol Burnett and others), opinion essay: [http://articles.latimes.com/1991-08-12/entertainment/ca-468_1_tabloids "Tabloids' Lies Abuse the First Amendment,"] August 12, 1991, ,"], ''[[The Los Angeles Times]],'' retrieved January 1, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tabloid_law_pt1_1999_08_atlantic"&gt;Beam, Alex, [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/08/tabloid-law/377722/ "Tabloid Law,"] Part 1 of two parts, August, 1999, ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]],'' retrieved January 1, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tabloid_law_pt2_1999_08_atlantic"&gt;Beam, Alex, [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/08/tabloid-law/377722/ "Tabloid Law,"] Part 2 of two parts, August, 1999, ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]],'' retrieved January 1, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dr_phil_2016_07_14_wash_post"&gt;Andrews, Travis M., [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/07/14/dr-phil-and-wife-robin-sue-the-national-enquirer-for-250000-million-citing-defamation/ "Dr_ Phil and wife Robin sue the National Enquirer for $250 million, citing defamation,"] July 14, 2016, ''[[The Washington Post]],'' retrieved January 1, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

The former longtime chief editor Iain Calder in his book ''The Untold Story'', asserted that after the Burnett lawsuit, while under his leadership, the ''Enquirer'' worked hard to check the reliability of its facts and its sources.
