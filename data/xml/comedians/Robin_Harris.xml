'''Robin Hughes Harris''' (August 30, 1953 – March 18, 1990) was an [[United States|American]] [[comedian]] and [[actor]], known for his recurring comic sketch about ''[[Bébé's Kids]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Comic's Legacy: 'Bebe's Kids'|work=[[The Los Angeles Times]]|date=1992-07-28|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1992-07-28/entertainment/ca-4863_1_robin-harris|accessdate=2010-10-03|first=Lawrence|last=Christon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Childhood==
Robin Harris was born in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]. His father, Earl, was a welder, and his mother, Mattie, was a factory seamstress.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1117700.html Robin Harris; Tragedy of a Funny Man; At His Funeral in Los Angeles, Tribute to a `Down-Home' Comedian]; March 26, 1990; David Mills; The Washington Post via HighBeam.com; accessed February 24, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961, the family moved to [[Los Angeles]], where he attended Manual Arts High School. Harris then attended [[Ottawa University]] in [[Kansas]]. During this time, he began to hone his craft of comedy. He worked for [[Hughes Aircraft]], a rental car company, and [[Security Pacific Bank]] to pay his bills. In 1980, he debuted at Los Angeles' Comedy Store.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

==Career==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2016}}
During the mid-1980s, Harris worked as the [[master of ceremonies]] at the Comedy Act Theater. His "old school" brand of humor began to gain him a mainstream following. Harris made his acting debut playing a bartender in ''[[I'm Gonna Git You Sucka]]'' (1988). Harris also had a role in [[Spike Lee]]'s ''[[Do the Right Thing]]'' (1989). As "Sweet Dick Willie", Harris served as part of the neighborhood "[[Greek chorus]]" that commented on the events of an increasingly tense day. Harris was Pop, the father of [[Christopher Reid (entertainer)|Kid]] in ''[[House Party (film)|House Party]]'' (1990). He followed up later that year with a small role as a [[jazz]] club MC in ''[[Mo' Better Blues]]''. He also appeared in [[Eddie Murphy]]'s ''[[Harlem Nights]]'' (1989).

===Bébé's Kids===
In Harris' "Bébé's Kids" routines, Harris' girlfriend Jamika would insist that he take her son and her friend Bébé's three children with them on a date, as she continually agreed to babysit them. The children would regularly make a fool out of and/or annoy Harris. "We Bébé's kids", they would proclaim, "we don't die...we ''multiply.''"{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

The [[Hudlin Brothers]] had intended to make a feature film based upon the "Bébé's Kids" sketches, but Harris died while the film was in pre-production. ''[[Bébé's Kids]]'' instead became an [[animated feature]]. It was directed by [[Bruce W. Smith]] and featured the voices of [[Faizon Love]] (as Harris), [[Vanessa Bell Calloway]], [[Marques Houston]], [[Nell Carter]], Jonell Green,
[[Rich Little]], and [[Tone Lōc]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E0CEED6103EF932A3575BC0A964958260|title=Bebe's Kids (1992)|authorlink=Caryn James|last=James|first=Caryn|date=1992-08-01|publisher=''The New York Times''|accessdate=2008-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,315785,00.html|title=In Living Color|date=1991-10-11|publisher=ew.com|accessdate=2008-08-21|first=John M.|last=Wilson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
In the early hours of March 18, 1990, Harris died in his sleep of a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] in the hotel room of his hometown Chicago's Four Season Hotel after performing for a sold out crowd at the [[New Regal Theater|Regal Theater]]. He was 36 years old.&lt;ref name=latimes&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997/oct/22/sports/sp-45352|title=A New Act to Catch|last=Norwood|first=Robyn|date=1997-10-22|publisher=''The Los Angeles Times''|accessdate=2008-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; His brother found him dead. Harris was transported back to California and interred in an outdoor crypt in [[Inglewood Park Cemetery]], near Los Angeles.

However, the character's legacy continued in the two sequels to ''House Party''. Kid is still shown to be healing from Pop's death in ''House Party 2'' through [[archive footage]], a photo of Pop comes to life and tells Kid "Keep your mind on them books and off them 'gals!", which was actually taken from a scene in the original ''House Party''. The film's setting, the fictional Harris University, is another tribute to the actor. In ''[[House Party 3]]'' when Pop's brother and Kid's uncle, Vester (played by [[Bernie Mac]]) looks at a photograph of him, he tells Kid how he misses his father and wishes he was still alive, and that he "owes him $150".{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

At the time of Harris's March 1990 death, his wife was pregnant with their son, Robin Harris, Jr.,&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt; who was born six months later, in September 1990.

In 2006, a posthumous [[DVD]], titled ''We Don't Die, We Multiply: The Robin Harris Story'' (2006), was released. The film features never-before seen performances by Harris and accolades from such contemporaries as [[Martin Lawrence]], [[Bernie Mac]], [[Cedric the Entertainer]], [[D.L. Hughley]], [[Robert Townsend (actor)|Robert Townsend]], and [[Joe Torry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1551429,00.html|title=''We Don't Die, We Multiply: The Robin Harris Story'' DVD Review|last=Watson|first=Margeaux|date=2006-10-26|publisher=ew.com|accessdate=2008-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film features a rap performed and dedicated to Harris by his son, Robin, Jr.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blackamericaweb.com/site.aspx/bawnews/robinharris1018|title=Robin Harris' life and comic legacy depicted in new documentary|last=Kennedy|first=John|date=2006-10-18|publisher=blackamericaweb.com|accessdate=2008-08-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061105031857/http://www.blackamericaweb.com/site.aspx/bawnews/robinharris1018|archivedate=November 5, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
