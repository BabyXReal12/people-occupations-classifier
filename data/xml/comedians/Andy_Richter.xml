'''Paul Andrew Richter''' (born October 28, 1966) is an American actor, writer, comedian, and late night talk show announcer. He is best known for his role as the [[sidekick]] of [[Conan O'Brien]] on each of the host's programs: ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien|Late Night]]'' and ''[[The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien|The Tonight Show]]'' on [[NBC]], and ''[[Conan (talk show)|Conan]]'' on [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]]. He is also known for his work as the voice of Mort in the [[Madagascar (franchise)|''Madagascar'' franchise]].

== Early life ==
Richter, the third of four children, was born in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]], [[Michigan]] to mother, Glenda Swanson (née Palmer), a kitchen cabinet designer, and father, Laurence R. Richter, who taught [[Russian language|Russian]] at [[Indiana University]] for more than 32 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiana.edu/~deanfac/bios/2007/Richter07.pdf "Statement on the retirement of Laurence R.

He graduated from [[Yorkville High School]] in 1984, where he was elected [[Prom King]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.allmovie.com/artist/andy-richter-291658/bio| work=[[All Movie Guide]]| title=Andy Richter - Biography}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Andy Richter Replaces Denny Hastert As The Star Of Yorkville, IL| date=June 2, 2015| url=http://teamcoco.com/video/andy-richter-denny-hastert-illinois?playlist=x;eyJ0b3RhbCI6MzMsInR5cGUiOiJwb3B1bGFyIiwiaWQiOiIifQ| website=[[TeamCoco]]| publisher=Conan O'Brien Show| accessdate=3 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents divorced when he was 4 and his father later came out as gay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast| url=https://itunes.apple.com/de/podcast/fitzdog-radio/id327207852| title=The Greg Fitzsimmons Show| date=November 27, 2012| time=51:05| host=[[Greg Fitzsimmons]]| access-date=January 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richter is of [[Swedish people|Swedish]] and [[German people|German]] descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|_tSGI5AGq-c|Norm MacDonald on Conan 2011 05 17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|59ohqFBpnRg|Richter on Conan}} (April 13, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
In the late 1980s, Richter attended [[Columbia College Chicago]] as a film major. While at Columbia, he learned the basics of comedic acting and writing by starring in numerous student films and videos. After leaving Columbia in 1988, Richter worked as a [[production assistant]] on commercial shoots in [[Chicago]]. In 1989, he began taking classes at Chicago's [[Improv Olympic]]. He went from student to "House Performer" within a year. Richter branched out working with "The Comedy Underground" and the [[Annoyance Theater]].

Richter wrote for the short-lived [[Jonathan Brandmeier]] television show.
[[File:Andy Richter 1997 cropped.jpg|thumb|Andy Richter in mid-1997 at the Stephen C. O'Connell Center, in Gainesville, Florida]]
In the early 1990s, the Annoyance Theater hit gold when producer [[Jill Soloway]] staged ''The Real Live Brady Bunch'' with live, word-for-word performances of the '70s sitcom. The show was so popular that it attracted national attention and moved to [[New York City]]. Richter was not an original member of the cast but the actor who played "[[Mike Brady (The Brady Bunch)|Mike Brady]]" in the Chicago cast opted not to go to New York. Richter asked Soloway if he could play "Mike" in New York and, since Soloway had not cast a replacement, she agreed.{{citation needed|date=January 2009}}

===''Late Night with Conan O'Brien''===
At the same time, ''The Real Live Brady Bunch'' was playing in New York, two fellow Annoyance members ([[Beth Cahill]] and [[Melanie Hutsell]], who played Marcia and Jan Brady in the "Real Live Brady Bunch" stage show) were hired as cast members on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. With friends on ''SNL'', Richter was able to get into the after-show parties where he met ''SNL'' writer [[Robert Smigel]]. Two years later, Smigel hired Richter for a new show he was producing, ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]''. Originally hired as a writer, Richter was upgraded to [[Conan O'Brien]]'s sidekick just weeks before the show began airing in 1993, after it became clear the two had a strong rapport, something Smigel noticed after sending Richter to join O'Brien on stage during a practice run-through when the production staff was testing lighting angles and sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://traffic.libsyn.com/girlonguy/Richter_mxd_1-2.mp3| title=Girl on Guy with Aisha Tyler 31 with Andy Richter| author=Aisha Tyler| date=January 23, 2012| accessdate=February 4, 2012| publisher=MyLibsyn| subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After seven years with the show, Richter departed from ''Late Night'' after the [[List of Late Night with Conan O'Brien episodes (season 7)|May 26, 2000 show]]. He later said of the decision, "After seven years of being on the show, I got itchy. I have a philosophy that if you enjoy good fortune, rather than sit there and say, 'Oh, that's fine, this amount is good enough for me,' you should try and push it. You should see how much you can stretch your good fortune. And I was curious."&lt;ref name="LAT0531"&gt;{{cite news |last=Sicha |first=Choire |date=May 31, 2009 |title=Andy Richter: 'I got itchy' |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/may/31/entertainment/ca-conversation31 |accessdate=June 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===After ''Late Night''===
Richter left his post at ''Late Night'' in 2000 to pursue a career acting in films and television. His first major venture, [[Fox Network|Fox]]'s ''[[Andy Richter Controls the Universe]]'', was canceled after two mid-season runs. His next Fox sitcom, ''[[Quintuplets]]'', lasted one season. His 2007 television series, ''[[Andy Barker P.I.]]'', was co-written and executive produced by [[Conan O'Brien]]. In the series, Richter played an accountant who could not attract clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=NBC cancels ‘Andy Barker, PI’| url=https://variety.com/2007/scene/markets-festivals/nbc-cancels-andy-barker-pi-1117962708/| newspaper=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]| date=April 9, 2007| first=Josef| last=Adalian}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a woman comes to his office thinking he is the former tenant, a private investigator, she asks him to find her husband who she thinks faked his death. Barker decides to pursue this job and becomes a private detective in earnest, and continues to do his accounting job, which seems to pick up as the series goes on. The series played on NBC, with all six episodes in the first season on NBC.com. The series was canceled after very poor ratings despite being named by ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' as one of the Top Ten Shows of 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Flynn| first=Gillian| date=March 9, 2007| title=Andy Barker, P.I.| journal=[[Entertainment Weekly]]| url=http://ew.com/article/2007/03/09/andy-barker-pi/| accessdate=October 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Tonight Show''===
On February 24, 2009, it was announced that Richter would be joining Conan O'Brien once again as the announcer for ''[[The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien]]'' in [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name="announcer"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.wfmj.com/story/9903325/andy-richter-named-announcer-for-nbcs-the-tonight-show-with-conan-obrien| title=Andy Richter named announcer for NBC's 'The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien'| publisher=[[WFMJ-TV]] News| date=February 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richter frequently appeared in comedy sketches on the show and often commented and interacted with Conan during the opening monologue; he was also part of the show's writing staff. In mid-December 2009, Richter also began joining Conan on the couch during the celebrity interviews, much like he did in his former sidekick role on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien|Late Night]]''. Richter said he enjoyed having a steady paycheck again and not having to deal with production companies while developing television shows. Richter said, "Now I'm so happy to be back and making TV every night, not asking permission from somebody and waiting six months to get their sparklingly clear and cogent notes. And then wait another month for them to get back from Hawaii and say, 'Yes, now we can go make television.' I felt like a plumber who kept going into the building and saying, 'Can we put some pipes together?' and watching my wrenches gather dust."&lt;ref name="LAT0531" /&gt;

===''Conan''===
When Conan O'Brien returned to the air as host of [[Conan (talk show)|his self-titled TBS show]] in 2010, Richter followed and resumed his roles as announcer, writer, general sidekick and participant in comedy sketches.

=== Game shows ===
Richter was considered to be a potential host of the classic ''[[Pyramid (game show)|Pyramid]]'' game show that was being developed for [[CBS]], but was ultimately not picked up by the network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2010/05/andy-richter-wrapping-deal-to-host-new-version-of-pyramid-for-cbs.html| title=Andy Richter wrapping deal to host new version of 'Pyramid' for CBS| work=Los Angeles Times| date=May 27, 2010| last=Flint| first=Joe}}&lt;/ref&gt; Had the series been picked up, it would not have affected Richter's role on ''[[Conan (talk show)|Conan]]''. On May 18, 2011, TBS announced development of a possible new version of ''Pyramid'', again to be hosted by Richter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2011/05/18/tnt-and-tbs-announce-extensive-slate-of-new-projects-from-top-talents-561104/20110518turner01/| title=TNT and TBS Announce Extensive Slate of New Projects from Top Talents| date=May 18, 2011| journal=[[The Futon Critic]]| accessdate=May 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2010, Richter hosted the ''Team Coco Presents the Conan Writers Live'' comedy special for [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] at the [[Just for Laughs]] festival in Chicago. He hosted in place of O'Brien, who was still prohibited from hosting any television program until fall 2010.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

In July 2013, Richter signed up to host a game show called ''Step Up'', which was ordered by Fox.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/news/a498914/andy-richter-game-show-ordered-by-fox.html| title=Andy Richter game show ordered by Fox| work=[[Digital Spy]]| last=Eames| first=Tom| accessdate=July 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richter currently holds the record for all-time highest one-day score on ''Celebrity [[Jeopardy!]]'', winning $68,000 during a first round game of the 2009–10 season's "[[List of Jeopardy! tournaments and events#Non-tournament events|Million Dollar Celebrity Invitational]]". His earnings were donated to the [[St. Jude Children's Research Hospital]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Million Dollar Celebrity Invitational, Game 1 (Andy Richter vs. [[Dana Delany]] vs. [[Wolf Blitzer]])|series=Jeopardy!|network=Syndicated|date=September 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017, he began hosting the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] game show ''[[Big Fan (TV series)|Big Fan]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/big-fan-abc-jimmy-kimmel-1201699997/| title=ABC Orders Game Show ‘Big Fan’ from Jimmy Kimmel and Banijay Studios| last=Prudom| first=Laura| date=2016-02-08| access-date=2017-01-10| language=en-US| newspaper=Variety}}&lt;/ref&gt;
