'''David Benjamin Wain''' (born August 1, 1969) is an American comedian, writer, actor, and director. He is most widely known for directing the feature films ''[[Role Models]]'', ''[[Wanderlust (2012 film)|Wanderlust]]'' and for both creating the [[Wet Hot American Summer (franchise)|''Wet Hot American Summer'' franchise]] and directing the feature film ''[[Wet Hot American Summer]]'', and the [[Netflix]] series ''[[Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp]]'' and ''[[Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later]]''. He is also known for his work on the sketch comedy series ''[[The State (1993 TV series)|The State]]''; for producing, directing and writing the [[Adult Swim]] series ''[[Childrens Hospital]]''; and voicing The Warden on the [[Adult Swim]] series ''[[Superjail!]]''. Wain is a founding member of comedy group [[Stella (comedy group)|Stella]], along with [[Michael Showalter]] and [[Michael Ian Black]], writing and starring in the [[Stella shorts]] and the later ''[[Stella (U.S. TV series)|Stella]]'' [[Stella (U.S. TV series)|TV series]].

==Early life==
Wain was born to a [[American Jews|Jewish]] family&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thejc.com/culture/interviews/i-ve-always-been-seen-by-other-people-as-jewish-1.441957 The Jewish Chronicle: "'I’ve always been seen by other people as Jewish'" by Stephen Applebaum] November 14, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/grantland-qa-david-wain-on-wet-hot-american-summer-on-set-hookups-and-paul-rudds-aging-secrets/ Grantland: "Grantland Q&amp;A: David Wain on ‘Wet Hot American Summer,’ On-Set Hookups, and Paul Rudd’s Aging Secrets"by Rachel Handler] July 31, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Shaker Heights, Ohio]], the son of Nina (née Saul) and Norman Wain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/palmbeachpost/obituary.aspx?n=nina-wain&amp;pid=129409963 |title=Nina Wain Obituary - West Palm Beach, FL &amp;#124; The Palm Beach Post |publisher=Legacy.com |date= |accessdate=2016-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a young man, Wain went to a summer camp in [[Canaan, Maine]], on which ''[[Wet Hot American Summer]]'' was loosely based.

==Career==
In 1988 while attending [[New York University|NYU]] [[Tisch School of the Arts|film school]], Wain became a founding member of the sketch comedy group ''The New Group.'' This group would later come to be known as The State, and in 1993 he and his fellow members created and starred in [[The State (1993 TV series)|The State]], a sketch show that lasted [[List of The State episodes|26 episodes]] on MTV. After ''The State'' ended, he, [[Michael Ian Black]], and [[Michael Showalter]] eventually formed the comedy trio [[Stella (comedy group)|Stella]].

Wain's first feature film, ''[[Wet Hot American Summer]]'' (2001), was an [[surreal humour|absurdist]] summer camp comedy starring [[Janeane Garofalo]], [[David Hyde Pierce]], [[Molly Shannon]], [[Paul Rudd]], [[Christopher Meloni]], [[Bradley Cooper]], [[Amy Poehler]], [[Ken Marino]], [[Michael Ian Black]] and [[Elizabeth Banks]]. Wain directed the film, and co-wrote and co-produced it with [[Michael Showalter]], who also plays a lead role.

His second feature film ''[[The Ten]]'', starring [[Winona Ryder]] and [[Paul Rudd]] (and a large ensemble cast of well-known actors) had a short theatrical run and was released on DVD on January 15, 2008.

Wain's third feature, ''[[Role Models]]'', starring [[Paul Rudd]], [[Seann William Scott]], [[Christopher Mintz-Plasse]], [[Jane Lynch]] and [[Elizabeth Banks]], was his first widely released film. Released in theaters on November 7, 2008, the film received positive reviews from critics and fans alike, as well as earning $19 million on its opening weekend.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0430922/business/ IMDB | Role Models – Box Office]&lt;/ref&gt; Its eventual worldwide gross was over $91 million.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

Wain starred in a web series titled ''[[Wainy Days]]'' on the website [[My Damn Channel]], which ran for five seasons and ended in January 2012. The series follows a fictionalized version of Wain through his everyday life as he tries to romance numerous women and discusses his problems with his friends at the [[sweatshop]] where he works. [[Elizabeth Banks]], [[Jonah Hill]], [[Jason Sudeikis]], [[Rob Corddry]], [[Thomas Lennon (actor)|Thomas Lennon]], [[Josh Charles]], [[Paul Rudd]], and [[Michael Ian Black]], and various other ''Stella'', ''The State'' and ''Wet Hot American Summer'' alumni have all guest-starred in various episodes. The recurring cast was [[A.D. Miles]], Matt Ballard and Zandy Hartig, who was instrumental in the creation of the series. 
[[File:David Wain USO Dec 6, 2015 (23559414106).jpg|thumb|Wain performing with a [[USO]] tour in 2015]]

As one third of the comedy troupe [[Stella (comedy group)|Stella]], Wain has co-hosted the long running Stella nightclub show in New York City, toured the United States and made a [[Stella shorts|series of shorts]] with the group, and eventually help create a [[Stella (U.S. TV series)|2005 series]] on [[Comedy Central]] based on Stella routines.

Wain is featured as the voice of The Warden in the animated series ''[[Superjail!]]''. He was a featured commentator in the ''[[I Love the '70s (U.S. TV series)|I Love the 70s]]'' series, ''[[I Love the 90s Part Deux]]'' series, and the weekly [[VH1]] show ''[[Best Week Ever]]''.. With ''The State'', Wain co-wrote the book ''State by State with The State''. He has appeared in such movies as ''[[The Baxter]]'', ''[[Keeping the Faith]]'' and ''[[Role Models]]''.
Wain's fourth feature film, ''[[Wanderlust (2012 film)|Wanderlust]]'', was released on February 24, 2012. It stars [[Jennifer Aniston]], [[Paul Rudd]], [[Malin Akerman]] and [[Alan Alda]]. Wain directed the film, from a screenplay he wrote with [[Ken Marino]], and has a cameo in the film as a TV weatherman.

His fifth feature ''[[They Came Together]]'' was released in June 2014. The cast includes [[Paul Rudd]], [[Amy Poehler]], [[Ed Helms]], [[Cobie Smulders]], [[Max Greenfield]], and [[Christopher Meloni]].  Wain and Showalter co-wrote the eight-episode Netflix prequel ''[[Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp]]'' based on the 2001 film with almost the entire cast of the original film returning. The series premiered on July 31, 2015, and was more well received by critics. He returned to co-write and direct the Netflix sequel ''[[Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later]]'' which premiered in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2016/10/alyssa-milano-wet-hot-american-summer-ten-years-later-season-two-1201838684/|title=Alyssa Milano Joins Season 2 Of ‘Wet Hot American Summer’|last=Fleming Jr.|first=Mike|date=2016-10-19|work=Deadline|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2016-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
