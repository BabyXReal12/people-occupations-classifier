'''Jonathan Harshman Winters III''' (November 11, 1925&amp;nbsp;– April 11, 2013) was an American comedian, actor, author, and artist. Beginning in 1960, Winters recorded many classic [[comedy album]]s for the [[Verve Records]] label. He also had [[Jonathan Winters#Discography|records released every decade]] for over 50 years, receiving 11 Grammy nominations, including eight for [[Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album|Best Comedy Album]], during his career. From these nominations, he won the [[Grammy Award for Best Album for Children#1970s|Grammy Award for Best Album for Children]] for his contribution to [[List of The Little Prince adaptations#Vinyl record|an adaptation]] of ''[[The Little Prince]]'' in 1975 and the [[38th Annual Grammy Awards#Spoken|Grammy Award for Best Spoken Comedy Album]] for ''Crank(y) Calls'' in 1996.

With a career spanning more than six decades, Winters also appeared in hundreds of television shows and films, including eccentric characters on ''[[The Steve Allen Show]]'', ''[[The Garry Moore Show]]'', ''The Wacky World of Jonathan Winters'' (1972–74), ''[[Mork &amp; Mindy]]'', ''[[Hee Haw]]'', and ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]''. He also voiced [[List of The Smurfs characters#Protagonists|Grandpa Smurf]] on ''[[The Smurfs (TV series)|The Smurfs]]'' TV series from 1986 to the show's conclusion in 1989. Over twenty years later, Winters was introduced to a new generation through voicing [[Papa Smurf]] in ''[[The Smurfs (film)|The Smurfs]]'' (2011) and ''[[The Smurfs 2]]'' (2013). Winters died nine days after recording his dialogue for ''The Smurfs 2''; the film was dedicated in his memory.

In 1991, Winters won the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series]] for playing Gunny Davis in the short-lived sitcom ''[[Davis Rules]]''. 1999 saw Winters become the 2nd recipient of the prestigious [[Mark Twain Prize for American Humor]]. In 2002, he was nominated for the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series]] for his performance as Q.T. Marlens on ''[[Life with Bonnie]]''. Winters was presented with a Pioneer [[TV Land Award]] by [[Robin Williams]] in 2008.

Winters also spent time painting and presenting his artwork, including [[Screen printing|silkscreens]] and sketches, in many [[Art exhibition|gallery shows]]. He authored several books. His book of short stories, titled ''[[Jonathan Winters#Bibliography|Winters' Tales]]'' (1988), made the bestseller lists.&lt;ref name="Post obit" /&gt;

==Early life==
Winters was born in [[Dayton, Ohio]], to Alice Kilgore Rodgers, who later became a radio personality, and her husband Jonathan Harshman Winters II&lt;!--Do not change to Jr., he was named after his grandfather--&gt;, an insurance agent who later became an investment broker.&lt;ref name="film reference" /&gt;&lt;ref name="beverly" /&gt; He was a descendant of Valentine Winters, founder of the Winters National Bank in [[Dayton, Ohio]] (now part of [[JPMorgan Chase]]). Of [[English people|English]] and [[Scotch-Irish American|Scotch-Irish]] ancestry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8Jt0hg_6uc |title=The LLS w/ Craig Ferguson 9/1/08 -5 of 7 Jonathan Winters |publisher=YouTube |date=September 2, 2008 |accessdate=April 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winters had described his father as an alcoholic who had trouble holding a job. His grandfather, a frustrated [[comedian]], owned the Winters National Bank, which failed as the family's fortunes collapsed during the [[Great Depression]].

When he was seven, his parents separated. Winters' mother took him to [[Springfield, Ohio]], to live with his maternal grandmother.&lt;ref name="Huffingtonpost obit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Happier Days" /&gt; "Mother and dad didn't understand me; I didn't understand them," Winters told [[Jim Lehrer]] on ''[[PBS NewsHour|The News Hour with Jim Lehrer]]'' in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://parade.condenast.com/154823/dotsonrader/robin-williams-discusses-his-first-experience-with-alcoholics-anonymous/|title=Robin Williams Discusses His First Experience with Alcoholics Anonymous|author=Parade|work=Parade|accessdate=October 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; "So consequently it was a strange kind of arrangement." Alone in his room, he would create characters and interview himself. A poor student, Winters continued talking to himself and developed a repertoire of strange sound effects. He often entertained his high school friends by imitating a race at the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]].&lt;ref name="Boston Globe obit" /&gt;

During his senior year at [[South High School (Springfield, Ohio)|Springfield High School]], Winters [[Dropping out|quit school]] to join the [[U.S. Marine Corps]] at age 17 and served two and a half years in the [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|Pacific Theater]] during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="beverly"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Corps Stories" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Springfield News Sun" /&gt; Upon his return, he attended [[Kenyon College]]. He later studied [[cartoonist|cartooning]] at [[Dayton Art Institute]], where he met Eileen Schauder, whom he married on September 11, 1948. He was a brother of the [[Delta Kappa Epsilon]] fraternity (Lambda chapter).

==Early career==

[[File:Jonathan Winters Gambrinus Beer.jpg|thumb|"Johnny" Winters promoting Gambrinus Beer in the early 1950s for [[August Wagner Breweries|August Wagner Breweries, Inc.]] on [[WBNS-TV]] in Columbus, Ohio]]

Winters' career started as a result of a lost wristwatch, about six or seven months after his marriage to Eileen in 1948. The newlyweds couldn't afford to buy another one. Then Eileen read about a talent contest in which the first prize was a wristwatch, and encouraged Jonathan to "go down and win it." She was certain he could, and he did.&lt;ref name="beverly"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Person to Person'' interview by Edward R. Murrow (March 14, 1958)&lt;/ref&gt; His performance led to a disc jockey job, where he was supposed to introduce songs and announce the temperature.&lt;ref name="beverly"/&gt; Gradually his [[ad lib]]s, personae, and antics took over the show.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20180308232635/http://certifiablyjonathan.net/jonathan.php Certifiably Jonathan — A Serious Comedy About Being Jonathan Winters]&lt;/ref&gt;

He began comedy routines and acting while studying at [[Kenyon College]] in [[Gambier, Ohio]]. He was also a local radio personality on [[WING]] (mornings, 6 to 8) in Dayton, Ohio, and at [[WIZE]] in Springfield, Ohio. He performed as "Johnny Winters" on [[WBNS-TV]] in [[Columbus, Ohio]], for two and a half years. Jerome R. "Ted" Reeves, then Program Director for WBNS-TV, arranged for his first audition with [[CBS]] in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;"A Jonathan Winters story that you've never heard," recollections of Columbus and Pittsburgh television personality Don Riggs, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mndv-c6JTyY (@ 2:55)&lt;/ref&gt;

After promising his wife that he would return to Dayton if he did not make it in a year, and with $56.46 in his pocket, he moved to New York City, staying with friends in Greenwich Village. After obtaining Martin Goodman as his agent, he began stand-up routines in various New York nightclubs. His earliest network television appearance was in 1954 on ''[[Chance of a Lifetime (1950s TV series)|Chance of a Lifetime]]'' hosted by [[Dennis James]] on the [[DuMont Television Network]], where Winters again appeared as "Johnny Winters."

Winters made [[History of television|television history]] in 1956 when [[RCA]] broadcast the first public demonstration of color [[videotape]] on ''The Jonathan Winters Show''. Author [[David Hajdu]] wrote in ''[[The New York Times]]'' (2006), "He soon used video technology 'to appear as two characters,' bantering back and forth, seemingly in the studio at the same time. You could say he invented the video stunt."&lt;ref name="Huffingtonpost obit" /&gt;

His big break occurred (with the revised name of Jonathan) when he worked for [[Alistair Cooke]] on the [[CBS Television]] Sunday morning show ''[[Omnibus (US TV series)|Omnibus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mndv-c6JTyY&amp;feature=related|publisher=YouTube|title=A Jonathan Winters story that you've never heard}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1957 he performed in the first color television show, a 15-minute routine sponsored by Tums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=429304222782773803|title=Archive of American Television Interview with Jonathan Winters, Part 2 of 5|publisher=Google Video}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Jonathan Winters 1956.JPG|thumb|upright|left|Winters performing a routine on ''[[The Colgate Comedy Hour|The NBC Comedy Hour]]'' (1956)]]

From 1959 to 1964, Winters' voice could be heard in a series of popular television commercials for [[Utica Club]] beer. In the ads, he provided the voices of talking beer steins, named Shultz and Dooley. Later, he became a spokesman for [[Hefty]] brand trash bags, for whom he appeared as a dapper [[Waste collector|garbageman]] known for collecting "gahr-bahj," as well as "Maude Frickert" and other characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObGR5AaqLkc&amp;NR=1|publisher=YouTube|title= 1970's Hefty Scrap Bags (Jonathan Winters) Commercial}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Winters recorded many classic [[comedy album]]s for the [[Verve Records]] label, starting in 1960. Probably the best known of his characters from this period is "Maude Frickert", the seemingly sweet old lady with the barbed tongue. He was a favorite of [[Jack Paar]], who hosted ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' from 1957 to 1962, and appeared frequently on his television programs, even going so far as to impersonate then–U.S. president [[John F. Kennedy]] over the telephone as a prank on Paar.

However, Winters had a dramatic role in ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'' episode "[[A Game of Pool (1961)|A Game of Pool]]" (episode 3.5 aired on October 13, 1961). He also recorded [[Ogden Nash]]'s ''[[The Carnival of the Animals]]'' poems to [[Camille Saint-Saëns]]'s classical opus.

On ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' (1962–92), Winters would usually perform in the guise of some character. [[Johnny Carson|Carson]] often did not know what Winters had planned and usually had to tease out the character's backstory during a pretend interview. Carson invented a character called "Aunt Blabby," which was similar to and possibly inspired by "Maude Frickert."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2013/04/12/jonathan-winters-dead-groundbreaking-improv-comic-was-87/|title=Fox News obituary|work=Fox News|accessdate=October 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Its a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World Trailer10.jpg|thumb|''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' (1963)]]
Winters appeared in more than 50 movies and many television shows, including particularly notable roles in the film ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' and in the dual roles of Henry Glenworthy and his dark, scheming brother, the Rev. Wilbur Glenworthy, in the [[The Loved One (film)|film adaptation]] of [[Evelyn Waugh]]'s novel ''[[The Loved One]]''.&lt;ref name="beverly"/&gt; Fellow comedians who starred with him in ''Mad World'', such as [[Arnold Stang]], said that in the long periods while they waited between scenes, Winters would entertain them for hours in their trailer by becoming any character that they would suggest to him.

He later participated on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[The American Sportsman]]'', hosted by [[Grits Gresham]], who took celebrities on hunting, fishing, and shooting trips to exotic places around the world.

Winters made memorable appearances on both ''[[The Dean Martin Show]]'' and ''[[The Dean Martin Celebrity Roast]]'', as well as a regular on ''[[The Andy Williams Show]]''. He also performed regularly as a panelist on ''[[The Hollywood Squares]]''.

During the late 1960s and early 1970s, Winters acted in ''[[The Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Coming]]'' (1966), had a weekly [[CBS]] show called ''The Jonathan Winters Show'' from 1967 to 1969, and appeared in ''[[Viva Max!]]'' (1970).&lt;ref name="beverly"/&gt; Additionally, he was a regular (along with [[Woody Allen]] and [[Jo Anne Worley]]) on the [[1970–71 United States network television schedule (Saturday morning)|Saturday morning children's television program]], ''[[Hot Dog (TV series)|Hot Dog]]'' in the early 1970s. He also had his own [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] show called ''The Wacky World of Jonathan Winters'', from 1972 to 1974, the Music Director of which, [[Van Alexander]], was nominated for a [[25th Primetime Emmy Awards#Winners and Nominees|1973 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Achievement in Music Direction of a Variety, Musical or Dramatic Program]].&lt;ref name=IMBD.Com&gt;{{cite web|title=Internet Movie Database|url=https://www.imdb.com/event/ev0000223/1973|work=Primetime Emmy Awards|publisher=IMDB.Com, Inc.|accessdate=December 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1980s and 1990s career==
Jonathan Winters was a [[Guest appearance|guest star]] on ''[[The Muppet Show]]'' in 1980. That same year, he also appeared in ''[[Pogo (comic strip)#Animation and puppetry|I Go Pogo]]'' (a.k.a. ''Pogo for President''). In 1981 he was a guest on the short-lived comedy series ''[[Aloha Paradise]]''.

In the [[Mork &amp; Mindy#Fourth season|fourth and final season]] of the [[Science fiction|sci-fi]]-styled TV comedy ''[[Mork &amp; Mindy]]'', Jonathan Winters (one of [[Robin Williams]]'s idols) was brought in as Mork &amp; Mindy's child, Mearth. Due to the different Orkan physiology, [[Mork &amp; Mindy|Mork]] laid an egg, which grew and hatched into the much older Winters. It had been previously explained that Orkans aged "backwards," thus explaining Mearth's appearance and that of his teacher, Miss Geezba (portrayed by then-11-year-old actress [[Louanne Sirota]]). Mork's infant son Mearth in ''Mork &amp; Mindy'' was created in hopes of improving ratings and as an attempt to capitalize on Williams's comedic talents. Winters had previously guest-starred in Season 3, Episode 18, as Dave McConnell, Mindy's uncle. However, after multiple scheduling and cast changes, ''Mork &amp; Mindy''&amp;apos;s fourth season was already quite low in the ratings and ended up being the show's last season.

[[File:Jonathan-Winters 1986.JPEG|thumb|upright|Winters performing at a [[USO]] show in 1986]]

Winters became a regular on ''[[Hee Haw]]'' during the 1983–1984 season. He was later the voice of [[Grandpa Smurf]] from 1986 to 1990 on the television series ''[[The Smurfs (1981 TV series)|The Smurfs]]''. Additionally, he did the [[voice acting|voice]] of Bigelow in the 1985 TV film ''[[Pound Puppies (TV special)|Pound Puppies]]'' and voice-acted on ''[[Yogi's Treasure Hunt]]'' in 1985, among other voice roles throughout the 1980s and 1990s.

In 1987, Winters was featured in [[NFL Films]]' ''[[Football Follies|The NFL TV Follies]]''. That same year he published ''Winters' Tales: Stories and Observations for the Unusual''.

In 1991 and 1992, he had a supporting role on ''[[Davis Rules]]'', a sitcom that lasted two seasons (25 episodes), for which he won a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series]]. He played Gunny Davis, an eccentric grandfather who was helping raise his grandchildren after his son lost his wife.

In addition to his live-action roles, he was a guest star on ''[[The New Scooby-Doo Movies]]'' (in an episode where he also voiced an animated version of his "Maude Frickert" character) and as the narrator in ''[[Frosty Returns]]'' which [[Frosty the Snowman (TV program)#Television rights|airs annually]] aired during the [[Christmas and holiday season|Christmas season]]. Winters also provided the voice for the thief in ''[[The Thief and the Cobbler]]''.

In 1994, Winters appeared as a fired factory worker (credited as "Grizzled Man") in ''[[The Flintstones]]''. In an interesting role reversal, he was the serious-minded secular police chief and uncle of the character Lamont Cranston (played by [[Alec Baldwin]]) in ''[[The Shadow (1994 film)|The Shadow]]''. That same year he voiced Stinkbomb D. Basset in the episode "Smell Ya Later" on ''[[Animaniacs]]''.

Winters received eleven Grammy nominations during his career, including eight for the [[Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album]]; he won the [[Grammy Awards of 1996#Spoken|Grammy Award for Best Spoken Comedy Album]] for ''Crank(y) Calls'' in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;Dagan, Carmel.

In 1996, Winters played himself in ''Bloopy's Buddies'', a children's TV series on [[PBS]] designed to teach children about health and nutrition and to encourage them to exercise.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tv.com/shows/bloopys-buddies/ ''Bloopy's Buddies''] at TV.com&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, he was awarded the [[John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts|Kennedy Center]]'s [[Mark Twain Prize for American Humor]], becoming the second recipient.

==Later years==
Winters had various roles and appeared in numerous television features throughout the early to mid-2000s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005565/filmoyear|title=Jonathan Winters (I) - Filmography by year|publisher=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, Winters appeared in ''[[The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle]]''. In 2003, he appeared in the film ''[[Swing (2003 film)|Swing]]''.

In 2004, ''[[Comedy Central]] Presents: 100 Greatest Stand-Ups of All Time'' ranked Winters as the #18 greatest stand-up comedian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.listology.com/list/comedy-central-100-greatest-standups-all-time|title=Comedy Central 100 Greatest Standups of all Time|publisher=Listology|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125061218/http://www.listology.com/list/comedy-central-100-greatest-standups-all-time|archivedate=November 25, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 and 2006, Winters appeared on ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=TV.com |url=http://www.tv.com/shows/jimmy-kimmel-live/jonathan-winters-kenan-thompson-against-me-848952/ |title=Jimmy Kimmel Live - Season 4, Episode 120: Jonathan Winters, Kenan Thompson, Against Me! |publisher=TV.com |date= |accessdate=April 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=TV.com |url=http://www.tv.com/shows/jimmy-kimmel-live/jonathan-winters-melissa-george-and-keyshia-cole-475756/ |title=Jimmy Kimmel Live - Season 3, Episode 62: Jonathan Winters, Melissa George, &amp; Keyshia Cole |publisher=TV.com |date= |accessdate=April 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Winters was presented with a Pioneer [[TV Land Award]] by [[Robin Williams]]. That same year, [[PBS]] aired ''Pioneers of Television'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/pioneers-of-television/pioneering-people/jonathan-winters/ |title=Jonathan Winters &amp;#124; Comedian &amp;#124; Pioneers of Television |publisher=PBS |date= |accessdate=April 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Make 'Em Laugh: The Funny Business of America'' in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/pbs-em-laugh-standup-job-article-1.421187 |title=PBS' 'Make 'em Laugh' does a standup job |publisher=NY Daily News |date= |accessdate=April 15, 2013 |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; both featuring Winters.

Winters was coaxed out of retirement to voice Papa Smurf in ''[[The Smurfs (film)|The Smurfs]]'' (2011), the first ever animated/live-action Smurfs film, and later in ''[[The Smurfs 2]]'' (2013), his final film project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worstpreviews.com/headline.php?id=16735&amp;count=0|title=Jonathan Winters to Voice Papa Smurf in "Smurfs" Movie|publisher=|accessdate=October 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died only nine days after he finished recording Papa's voice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tmz.com/2013/04/12/jonathan-winters-photo-before-death-smurfs/|title=Papa Smurf Jonathan Winters -- La La La La La La ...

Winters was originally cast in ''Big Finish'' (2014), during [[pre-production]]. It is a comedy set in a [[retirement home]]. His scheduled role was to appear alongside [[Jerry Lewis]] and [[Bob Newhart]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/jonathan-winters-dies-at-87-438626 |title = Jonathan Winters Dies at 87|publisher=Hollywood Reporter | first=Duane|last=Byrge|date=April 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news/jonathan-winters-dead-dies-death-87-mork-and-mindy_3602528 |title = Legendary Film &amp; TV Funnyman Jonathan Winters Dies, Aged 87|publisher=Contactmusic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
On February 8, 1960, Winters received a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].&lt;ref name="LA Times obit" /&gt;

In his interview with the [[Archive of American Television]], Winters reported that he spent eight months in a private [[psychiatric hospital]] in 1959 and again in 1961. The comic suffered from [[mental breakdown|nervous breakdowns]] and [[bipolar disorder]].&lt;ref name="Post obit" /&gt; With an unprecedented frenetic energy, Winters made obscure references to his illness and hospitalization during his [[Stand-up comedy|stand-up routines]], most famously on his 1960 comedy album, ''[[The Wonderful World of Jonathan Winters]]''. During his classic "flying saucer" routine, Winters casually mentions that if he wasn't careful, the authorities might put him back in the "zoo", referring to the institution.

"These voices are always screaming to get out," Winters told the ''[[Fort Worth Star-Telegram]]''. "They follow me around pretty much all day and night." Winters was able to use his talents in [[voice-over]] roles as a result. A devotee of [[Groucho Marx]] and [[Laurel and Hardy]], Winters once claimed, "I've done for the most part pretty much what I intended." He told ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report|U.S. News]]'', "I ended up doing comedy, writing, and painting.... I've had a ball, and as I get older I just become an older kid."&lt;ref name="Huffingtonpost obit" /&gt;

Winters lived near [[Santa Barbara, California]], and was often seen browsing or "hamming" for the crowd at the [[antique]] and gun shows on the [[Ventura County Fair|Ventura County fairgrounds]]. He often entertained the tellers and other employees whenever he visited his local bank to make a deposit or withdrawal. Additionally, he spent his time painting and attended many [[art museum|gallery showings]], even presenting his art in one-man shows.

On January 11, 2009, Winters' wife of more than 60 years, Eileen, died at the age of 84 after a 20-year battle with [[breast cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mccrearyrecord.com/opinion/local_story_013141453.html?keyword=secondarystory Write On: "Behind Every Great Man..."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202203844/http://www.mccrearyrecord.com/opinion/local_story_013141453.html?keyword=secondarystory |date=February 2, 2009 }}, ''[[McCreary County Record]]'', January 13, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Winters died of [[death by natural causes|natural causes]] on the evening of April 11, 2013, in [[Montecito, California]] at the age of 87.&lt;ref name="beverly"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NY Times obit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Baltimore News Journal" /&gt;
He was survived by his two children, Jay Winters and Lucinda Winters, and five grandchildren.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seattlepi.com/entertainment/tv/tvguide/article/Comedian-Jonathan-Winters-Dies-at-87-4430400.php Obituary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130413165813/http://www.seattlepi.com/entertainment/tv/tvguide/article/Comedian-Jonathan-Winters-Dies-at-87-4430400.php |date=April 13, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was cremated and his ashes were given to his family.

Fans of Winters placed flowers on his [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] star on April 12, 2013 at 1:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&lt;ref name="CBS LA obit" /&gt;

Many comedians, actors, and friends gave personal tributes about Winters on [[social media]] shortly after his death. [[Robin Williams]] posted, "First he was my idol, then he was my mentor and amazing friend. I'll miss him huge. He was my Comedy Buddha. Long live the Buddha."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tv.msn.com/tv/article.aspx?news=802217&amp;affid=100055 |title=Robin Williams, Steve Martin and more pay tribute to Jonathan Winters - MSN TV News |publisher=Tv.msn.com |date= |accessdate=April 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2013/04/12/comedians-pay-tribute-to-jonathan-winters/2078591/ |title=Comedians pay tribute to Jonathan Winters |publisher=Usatoday.com |date=June 8, 2008 |accessdate=April 15, 2013 |first1=Ann |last1=Oldenburg}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pond |first=Steve |url=https://tv.yahoo.com/news/steve-martin-steve-carell-pee-wee-herman-pay-194755904.html?.tsrc=hellomotoar?date=20220323 |title=Steve Martin, Steve Carell, Pee-wee Herman Pay Tribute to 'Celestially Brilliant' Jonathan Winters - Yahoo!

==Comedy style and legacy==
A pioneer of [[improvisation]]al [[stand-up comedy]] with a gift for [[Mimesis|mimicry]], [[Impersonator|impersonation]]s, various personalities, and a seemingly bottomless reservoir of creative energy, Winters was one of the first celebrities to go public with a personal [[Mental disorder|mental illness]] issue and felt stigmatized as a result.&lt;ref name="Variety obit" /&gt; According to [[Jack Paar]], "If you were to ask me the funniest 25 people I've ever known, I'd say, 'Here they are—Jonathan Winters.'{{Space double}} He also said of Winters, "Pound for pound, the funniest man alive."&lt;ref name="Variety obit" /&gt;

With his round, rubber-faced mastery of [[Impressionist (entertainment)|impressions]] (including ones of [[John Wayne]], [[Cary Grant]], [[Groucho Marx]], [[James Cagney]], and others) and [[improvisation]]al comedy, Winters became a staple of [[Late night television in the United States|late-night television]] with a career spanning more than six decades. With notable honors, many television show, film and [[Stand-up comedy|comedy circuit]] appearances, Winters was known to start his stage shows by commanding an applauding audience that had risen to its feet to: "Please remain standing throughout the evening."&lt;ref name="Post obit" /&gt;

Winters performed a wide range of characters: [[hillbilly|hillbillies]], arrogant [[city slicker]]s, nerve-shattered airline pilots trying to hide their fear, disgruntled [[Western (genre)|westerners]], judgmental [[Martian]]s, little old ladies, nosy gas station attendants, a hungry cat eyeing a mouse, the oldest living airline stewardess, and more. "I was fighting for the fact that you could be funny without telling jokes," he told ''[[The New York Times]]'', adding that he thought of himself foremost as a writer and less as a stand-up comedian. He named [[James Thurber]]'s sophisticated absurdity as influential and said he idolized writers with a gift for humor.&lt;ref name="Post obit" /&gt;

Two of his most memorable characters, cranky granny "Maude Frickert" and [[Yokel|bumpkin]] farmer "Elwood P. Suggins" ("I think eggs 24 hours a day"), were born from his early television routines. [[Robin Williams]] once told ''[[Playboy]]'' why Mr. Winters inspired him. "It was like seeing a guy behind a mask, and you could see that his characters were a great way for him to talk about painful stuff," he said. "I found out later that they are people he knows—his mother, his aunt. He's an artist who also paints with words. He paints these people that he sees."&lt;ref name="Post obit" /&gt;
[[File:Its a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World Trailer18.jpg|thumb|Jonathan Winters crashes through a wall. ''It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World'' (1963)]]

Onstage and off, Winters was wildly unpredictable. He was often viewed by [[Film producer|producers]] as a liability, and this led to a scattershot, though memorable, film career. On television, his two self-titled variety shows displayed him in dazzling form as a [[sketch comedy|sketch comic]] and [[impersonator]].&lt;ref name="Post obit" /&gt;

Winters was an [[Artistic inspiration|inspiration]] for performers such as [[Johnny Carson]], [[Billy Crystal]], [[Tracey Ullman]], [[Lily Tomlin]], [[Steve Martin]], [[Jim Carrey]], and [[Jimmy Kimmel]]. Robin Williams credited Winters as his comedy mentor, and the two co-starred on ''[[Mork &amp; Mindy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/video/robin-williams-remembers-comic-legend-jonathan-winters-18947090|title=Robin Williams Remembers Comic Legend Jonathan Winters|format = Video| publisher= ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1991 interview with the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', Winters likened the [[Show business|entertainment industry]] to the [[Olympic Games|Olympics]], with actors standing on boxes to receive [[gold medal|gold]], [[silver medal|silver]], and [[bronze medals]]. Winters claimed, "I think my place is inside the box, underneath the guy receiving the gold medal. They're playing the national anthem and I'm fondling a platinum medallion."&lt;ref name="Post obit" /&gt;
