'''James Hugh Calum Laurie''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100|CBE}} ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|ɒr|i}}; born 11 June 1959) is an English actor, director, musician, comedian, and author.

Laurie first gained recognition for his work as one half of the comedy double act [[Fry and Laurie]] with friend and comedy partner [[Stephen Fry]], whom he met through mutual friend [[Emma Thompson]] whilst attending [[Cambridge University]], where Laurie was president of the [[Cambridge Footlights]]. The duo acted together in a number of projects during the 1980s and 1990s, including the sketch comedy series ''[[A Bit of Fry &amp; Laurie]]'' and the [[P. G. Wodehouse]] adaptation ''[[Jeeves and Wooster]]''. Laurie's other roles during the period include the period comedy series ''[[Blackadder]]'' (in which Fry also appeared) and the films ''[[Sense and Sensibility (film)|Sense and Sensibility]]'', ''[[101 Dalmatians (1996 film)|101 Dalmatians]]'', ''[[The Borrowers (1997 film)|The Borrowers]]'' and ''[[Stuart Little (film)|Stuart Little]]''.

Laurie portrayed the title character in the U.S. medical drama series ''[[House (TV series)|House]]'' (2004–12) on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], for which he won a [[Golden Globe Award]]. He was listed in the 2011 ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' as the most watched leading man on television and was one of the highest-paid actors in a television drama, earning £250,000 ($409,000) per episode of ''House''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/8762970/Guinness-Book-of-Records-Hugh-Laurie-is-most-watched-man-on-television.html Guinness Book of Records: Hugh Laurie is most watched man on television] ''The Daily Telegraph''.

He also played the lead role of forensic psychiatrist Dr. Eldon Chance in the [[Hulu]] series ''[[Chance (TV series)|Chance]]'' (2016–17).

Outside acting, Laurie has released two blues albums, ''[[Let Them Talk (Hugh Laurie album)|Let Them Talk]]'' (2011) and ''[[Didn't It Rain (Hugh Laurie album)|Didn't It Rain]]'' (2013), both to favourable reviews, and has authored a novel, ''[[The Gun Seller]]'', published in 1996. Among his honours, Laurie has won three [[Golden Globe Award]]s, two [[Screen Actors Guild Award]]s and has been nominated for ten [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s. He received a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VBRYcO_YdI|title=Hugh Laurie - Walk of Fame  Ceremony|first=|last=Variety|date=9 February 2017|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Laurie, she endured the disease for two years; and she suffered "painful, plodding paralysis" while being cared for by Laurie's father, whom he called "the sweetest man in the whole world".&lt;ref name="GQ"/&gt;

Laurie's parents, who were of [[Scottish people|Scottish]] descent, attended St. Columba's Presbyterian Church of England (now [[United Reformed Church]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saintcolumbas.org/about-us/our-history|title=Our History|publisher=St Columba's United Reformed Church, Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Oxford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dr. Feelbad|work=Rolling Stone|author=Strauss, Neil|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/13893076/dr_feelbad_hugh_laurie_became_the_dark_prince_of_prime_time_by_playing_the_best_vicodinaddicted_t|date=5 April 2007|accessdate=13 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/scotsol/homepage/news/3445560/Hugh-rant-at-Scots.html |title=Scottish News |work=The Sun |date=4 March 2011 |accessdate=11 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/5421264/Hugh-Laurie-interview.html |title=Hugh Laurie interview |work=The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=11 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He notes that "belief in God didn't play a large role in my home, but a certain attitude to life and the living of it did".&lt;ref name="actors"/&gt; He followed this by stating, "Pleasure was something that was treated with great suspicion, pleasure was something that... I was going to say it had to be earned but even the earning of it didn't really work. It was something to this day, I mean, I carry that with me. I find pleasure a difficult thing; I don't know what you do with it, I don't know where to put it."&lt;ref name="actors"/&gt; He later stated, "I don't believe in God, but I have this idea that if there were a God, or destiny of some kind looking down on us, that if he saw you taking anything for granted he'd take it away."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/sunday-telegraph/man-about-the-house/story-e6frewt9-1111114738268 ''Man about the House''], The Daily Telegraph, 28 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Laurie was brought up in Oxford and attended the [[Dragon School]] from ages seven to 13 and stated, "I was, in truth, a horrible child. Not much given to things of a bookey nature, I spent a large part of my youth smoking [[Cigarette|Number Six]] and cheating in French vocabulary tests."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hugh Laurie: Wodehouse Saved my Life | accessdate=4 June 2012|url=http://www.pgwodehousebooks.com/lauriesaved.htm|work=The Daily Telegraph| date=25 May 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to [[Eton College]], which he describes as "the most private of private schools".&lt;ref name="actors" /&gt; He says he attended [[Selwyn College, Cambridge]] "as a result of family tradition" as his father "went to Cambridge and I applied to the same college".&lt;ref name="actors"/&gt; Laurie notes his father had a successful bout as an oarsman at Cambridge and that he was "trying to follow in his father's footsteps".&lt;ref name="actors" /&gt; He read [[archaeology]] and [[anthropology]], specialising in [[social anthropology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sel.cam.ac.uk/alumni/Selwyn%20Honorary%20Fellows%20Announcement.pdf |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20120712162327/http://www.sel.cam.ac.uk/alumni/Selwyn%20Honorary%20Fellows%20Announcement.pdf |dead-url=yes |archivedate=12 July 2012 |title=Welcome back to Selwyn! |publisher=Selwyn College |accessdate=13 June 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like his father, Laurie was an oarsman at school and university.&lt;ref name="actors"/&gt; In 1977, he was a member of the junior coxed pair that won the British national title before representing Britain's Youth Team at the 1977 Junior World Rowing Championships. In 1980, Laurie and his rowing partner, J.S. Palmer, were runners-up in the [[Silver Goblets &amp; Nickalls' Challenge Cup|Silver Goblets]]&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.rowinghistory.net/HRR%20US/hrr_1946-2000.htm Henley Royal Regatta Results of Final Races – 1946–2003 (1980).] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716161931/http://www.rowinghistory.net/HRR%20US/hrr_1946-2000.htm |date=16 July 2011 }}" RowingHistory.net.&lt;/ref&gt; coxless pairs for Eton Vikings rowing club. Later, Laurie also achieved a [[Blue (university sport)|Blue]] while taking part in the [[The Boat Race 1980|1980 Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race]].&lt;ref name="LaurLondTimes"&gt;{{cite news|title= Hugh Laurie on House, fame and LA|author=Crampton, Robert|work=The Times |location=UK |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article3617324.ece|accessdate=30 March 2008|date= 29 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cambridge lost that year by five&amp;nbsp;feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Husband |first=Stuart |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/5421264/Hugh-Laurie-interview.html |title=Hugh Laurie interview at |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |date=3 June 2009 |accessdate=12 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, Laurie was training for up to eight&amp;nbsp;hours a day and was on course to become an Olympic-standard rower.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.motleyhealth.com/celeb/hugh-laurie-the-super-fit-athlete-and-actor ''Hugh Laurie – the Super Fit Athlete and Actor''], MotleyHealth, 18 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Laurie is a member of [[Leander Club]], one of the oldest rowing clubs in the world. He was also a member of the [[Hermes Club]] and the [[Hawks' Club]].&lt;ref name="actors"/&gt;

==Career==
===Acting===
Forced to abandon rowing during a bout of [[glandular fever]] (mononucleosis), Laurie joined the [[Footlights|Cambridge Footlights]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Tatler List|url=http://www.tatler.com/the-tatler-list|publisher=Tatler|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205224814/http://www.tatler.com/the-tatler-list|archivedate=5 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the university dramatic club that has produced many well-known actors and comedians. There he met [[Emma Thompson]], with whom he had a romantic relationship; the two remain good friends.&lt;ref name="actors"/&gt; She introduced him to his future comedy partner, [[Stephen Fry]]. Laurie, Fry and Thompson later parodied themselves as the ''[[University Challenge]]'' representatives of "Footlights College, Oxbridge" in "[[Bambi (Young Ones episode)|Bambi]]", an episode of ''[[The Young Ones (TV series)|The Young Ones]]'', with the series' co-writer [[Ben Elton]] completing their team.

In 1980–81, his final year at university, besides rowing, Laurie was president of the Footlights, with Thompson as vice-president. They took their annual revue, [[The Cellar Tapes]], to the [[Edinburgh Fringe|Edinburgh Fringe Festival]] and won the first [[Perrier Comedy Award]]. The revue was written principally by Laurie and Fry, and the cast also included Thompson, [[Tony Slattery]], [[Paul Shearer]] and [[Penny Dwyer]]. He states that he did not graduate from Cambridge.&lt;ref name="actors"/&gt; The Perrier Award led to a West End transfer for ''The Cellar Tapes'' and a television version of the revue, broadcast in May 1982. It resulted in Laurie, Fry and Thompson being selected, along with Ben Elton, [[Robbie Coltrane]] and [[Siobhan Redmond]] to write and appear in a new sketch comedy show for [[Granada Television]], ''[[Alfresco (TV series)|Alfresco]]'', which ran for two series.

[[Fry and Laurie]] went on to work together on various projects throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Among them were the ''[[Blackadder]]'' series, written by [[Ben Elton]] and [[Richard Curtis]], starring [[Rowan Atkinson]], with Laurie in various roles, including [[George (Blackadder)|Prince George]] and [[George (Blackadder)|Lieutenant George]].&lt;ref name="actors"/&gt; Other projects followed, of which one was their [[BBC]] sketch comedy series ''[[A Bit of Fry &amp; Laurie]]''; another project was ''[[Jeeves and Wooster]]'',&lt;ref name="actors"/&gt; an adaptation of [[P. G. Wodehouse]]'s stories, in which Laurie played Jeeves's employer, the amiable twit [[Bertie Wooster]]. He and Fry worked together at various charity stage events, such as ''Hysteria! 1, 2 &amp; 3'' and [[Amnesty International]]'s ''[[The Secret Policeman's Balls|The Secret Policeman's Third Ball]]'', ''[[Comic Relief (charity)|Comic Relief]]'' TV shows and the variety show ''Fry and Laurie Host a [[Christmas Night with the Stars]]''. They collaborated again on the film ''[[Peter's Friends]]'' and came together for a retrospective show in 2010 titled ''Fry and Laurie Reunited''.

Laurie starred in the Thames Television film ''Letters from a Bomber Pilot'' (1985) directed by David Hodgson. This was a serious acting role, the film being dramatised from the letters home of [[Pilot Officer]] J.R.A. "Bob" Hodgson, a pilot in [[RAF Bomber Command]], who was [[killed in action]] in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/410109 |title="LETTERS FROM A BOMBER PILOT (1985)" at bfi.org |publisher=Ftvdb.bfi.org.uk |date=16 April 2009 |accessdate=12 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laurie appeared in the music videos for the 1986 single "[[Experiment IV]]" by [[Kate Bush]], and the 1992 [[Annie Lennox]] single "[[Walking on Broken Glass]]" in [[British Regency]] period costume alongside [[John Malkovich]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Og0EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA26&amp;dq=walking+on+broken+glass+hugh+laurie+john+malkovich&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ToS3Tq-HJtPW8QPTwN2gDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=walking%20on%20broken%20glass%20hugh%20laurie%20john%20malkovich&amp;f=false Billboard 7 December 2002] ''Billboard''. Retrieved 7 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997 Laurie appeared in the [[Spice Girls]]' film  ''[[Spice World (film)|Spice World]]''. In 1998, Laurie had a brief guest-starring role on ''[[Friends]]'' in "[[The One with Ross's Wedding]]".

Laurie's later film appearances include ''[[Sense and Sensibility (film)|Sense and Sensibility]]'' (1995), adapted by and starring [[Emma Thompson]]; the [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] live-action film ''[[101 Dalmatians (1996 film)|101 Dalmatians]]'' (1996), where he played Jasper, one of the bumbling criminals hired to kidnap the puppies; Elton's adaptation of his novel ''Inconceivable'', ''[[Maybe Baby (2000 film)|Maybe Baby]]'' (2000); ''[[Girl from Rio]]''; the [[Flight of the Phoenix (2004 film)|2004 remake]] of ''[[The Flight of the Phoenix]]'', and ''[[Stuart Little (film)|Stuart Little]]''.

Since 2002, Laurie has appeared in a range of British television dramas, guest-starring that year in two episodes of the first season of the spy thriller series ''[[Spooks (TV series)|Spooks]]'' on BBC One. In 2003, he starred in and also directed ITV's comedy-drama series ''[[Fortysomething (UK series)|fortysomething]]'' (in one episode of which Stephen Fry appears). In 2001, he voiced the character of a bar patron in the ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode "[[One If by Clam, Two If by Sea]]". Laurie voiced the character of Mr. Wolf in the cartoon ''[[Preston Pig]]''. He was a panellist on the first episode of ''[[QI]]'', alongside Fry as host. In 2004, Laurie guest-starred as a professor in charge of a space probe called ''Beagle'', on ''[[The Lenny Henry Show]]''.

Between 2004 and 2012 he starred as the acerbic physician specialising in diagnostic medicine, [[Gregory House|Dr. Gregory House]] in the popular Fox medical drama ''[[House (TV series)|House]]''. For his portrayal, Laurie assumed an American accent.&lt;ref name="actors"/&gt; Laurie was in [[Namibia]] filming ''[[Flight of the Phoenix (2004 film)|Flight of the Phoenix]]'' and recorded the audition tape for the show in the bathroom of the hotel, the only place he could get enough light.&lt;ref name="usatoday"&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2004-11-15-hugh-laurie_x.htm|title=Hugh Laurie Gets Into 'House'|accessdate=23 March 2008|author=Bill, Keveney|date=15 November 2004|work=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; While working on ''Flight of the Phoenix'', [[Jacob Vargas]] operated the camera to shoot Laurie's audition tape for ''House''. Laurie's American accent was so convincing that executive producer [[Bryan Singer]], who was unaware at the time that Laurie was British, pointed to him as an example of just the kind of compelling American actor he had been looking for.&lt;ref name="usatoday"/&gt; Laurie also adopted the accent between takes on the set of ''House'',&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/12/arts/television/12house.html|title=Tormented Doctor Turns to Directing |accessdate=16 June 2010|author=Bill, Carter |date= 11 April 2010|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as during script read-throughs, although he used his native accent when directing the ''House'' episode "[[Lockdown (House)|Lockdown]]".&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; Laurie also served as director for the episode "The C-Word" of the show's final season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hugh Laurie: Directing House episode for final series was huge responsibility|url=http://metro.co.uk/2012/05/03/hugh-laurie-directing-house-episode-for-final-series-was-huge-responsibility-419349/|work=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]|accessdate=1 February 2013|date=3 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laurie was nominated for an [[Emmy Award]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/hugh-laurie |title=Hugh Laurie Emmy Nominated |publisher=Emmys.com |accessdate=30 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; for his role in ''House'' in 2005. Although he did not win, he did receive a [[Golden Globe]] in both 2006 and 2007 for his work on the series and the [[Screen Actors Guild]] award in 2007 and 2009. Laurie was also awarded a large increase in salary, from what was rumoured to be a mid-range five-figure sum to $350,000 per episode. Laurie was not nominated for the 2006 Emmys, apparently to the outrage of Fox executives,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422200515/http://www.thefirstpost.co.uk/1416%2Cfeatures%2Cfans-fury-over-laurie8217s-emmy-snub |archivedate=22 April 2009 |url=http://www.thefirstpost.co.uk/1416,features,fans-fury-over-laurie8217s-emmy-snub |title=Fans' fury over Laurie's Emmy snub |first=Anne |last=Bergman |work=[[The First Post]] |deadurl=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt; but he still appeared in a scripted, pre-taped intro, where he parodied his ''House'' character by rapidly diagnosing host [[Conan O'Brien]] and then proceeded to grope him as the latter asked him for help to get to the Emmys on time. He would later go on to speak in French while presenting an Emmy with [[Helen Mirren|Dame Helen Mirren]], and has since been nominated in 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011.

Laurie was initially cast as [[Perry White]], the editor of the ''[[Daily Planet]]'', in Singer's film ''[[Superman Returns]]'' but had to bow out of the project because of his involvement in ''House''. In July 2006, Laurie appeared on ''[[Inside the Actors Studio]]'', where he also performed one of his own comic songs, "Mystery", accompanying himself on the piano.&lt;ref name="actors"/&gt; He hosted NBC's ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', in which he appeared in [[drag (clothing)|drag]] in a sketch about a man ([[Kenan Thompson]]) with a broken leg who accuses his doctor of being dishonest. Laurie played the man's wife.

In August 2007, Laurie appeared on [[BBC Four]]'s documentary ''Stephen Fry: 50 Not Out'', filmed in celebration of Fry’s 50th birthday. In 2008, he took part in ''[[Blackadder Rides Again]]'' and appeared as Captain James Biggs in ''[[Street Kings]]'', opposite [[Keanu Reeves]] and [[Forest Whitaker]], and then in 2009 as the eccentric Dr. Cockroach, PhD in [[DreamWorks]]' ''[[Monsters vs. Aliens]]''. He also hosted ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' for the second time on the Christmas show in which he sang a medley of three-second Christmas songs to close his monologue. In 2009, Laurie returned to guest star in another ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode, "[[Business Guy]]", parodying [[Gregory House]]. In 2010, Laurie guest starred in ''[[The Simpsons]]'' "[[Treehouse of Horror XXI]]" as Roger, a castaway who is planning a murder scheme on a ship during Homer and Marge's second honeymoon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hugh Laurie in The Simpsons 'Treehouse of Horror XXI': B-Roll|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOx5vZk_wtU|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=18 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 February 2012, Fox announced that season eight of ''[[House (TV series)|House]]'' would be the last. On 13 June 2012, the media announced that Laurie was in negotiations to play the villain in ''[[RoboCop (2014 film)|RoboCop]]'', a remake of [[RoboCop (1987 film)|the original ''RoboCop'' film]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jun/13/hugh-laurie-villain-robocop |title=Hugh Laurie in talks to play villain in Robocop remake|newspaper= The Guardian|date=13 June 2012 |accessdate=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These negotiations ultimately fell through and Laurie passed on the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.denofgeek.com/movies/robocop/22446/hugh-laurie-won’t-be-in-the-robocop-reboot |title=Hugh Laurie won't be in the RoboCop reboot |accessdate=28 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Laurie starred in an independent feature called ''[[The Oranges (film)|The Oranges]]'' that had a limited release. The ''[[New York Post]]'' felt that he was "less-than-ideally cast" in the role of a dad who has an affair with his neighbour's daughter, played by [[Leighton Meester]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lumenick|first=Lou|title="The Oranges" movie review – Fresh sueezed angst|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/movies/fresh_squeezed_angst_cz8zMmVhXDU6priT87k3cL|work=[[New York Post]]|accessdate=9 January 2013|date=4 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Star-Ledger]]'' of Newark, New Jersey thought that he was "particularly good".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Whitty|first=Stephen|title='The Oranges' review: Lust and found in New Jersey|url=http://www.nj.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2012/10/the_oranges_review_lost_and_lu.html|work=[[The Star-Ledger]]|accessdate=9 January 2013|date=5 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
[[File:Hugh Laurie at Montreux Jazz Festival.jpg|180px|thumb|Hugh Laurie performing at the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]]]]
Laurie took piano lessons from the age of six.&lt;ref name=river/&gt; He sings and plays piano, guitar, drums, harmonica and saxophone. He has displayed his musical talents throughout his acting career, such as on ''A Bit of Fry &amp; Laurie'', ''[[Jeeves and Wooster]]'', ''House'' and when he hosted ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in October 2006. He is a vocalist and keyboard player for the Los Angeles charity rock group [[Band From TV]].

Additionally, following [[Meat Loaf]]'s appearance in the ''House'' episode "[[Simple Explanation]]", Laurie played piano as a special guest on the song "If I Can't Have You" from [[Meat Loaf]]'s 2010 album ''[[Hang Cool Teddy Bear]]''. Laurie co-wrote and performed the humorous blues song, "Sperm Test in the Morning", in the film ''[[Maybe Baby (2000 film)|Maybe Baby]]''.&lt;ref name="ya"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.movies.yahoo.com/person/hugh-laurie/|title=Hugh Laurie Filmography|publisher=[[Yahoo!

On ''House'', Laurie played several classic rock 'n roll instruments including [[Gibson Flying V]] and [[Les Paul guitar|Les Paul]] guitars. His character has a [[Hammond B-3]] organ in his home and on one episode performed the introduction to [[Procol Harum]]'s classic "[[Whiter Shade of Pale]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/newreleases/release.aspx?releaseID=427 |title=Hang Cool Teddy Bear by Meat Loaf |publisher=[[Roadrunner Records]] |accessdate=13 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100729145218/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/newreleases/release.aspx?releaseID=427 |archivedate=29 July 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 July 2010, it was announced that Laurie would be releasing a [[blues music|blues]] album after signing a contract with [[Warner Bros.

The album features collaborations from well-known artists such as [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]], [[Irma Thomas]] and [[Dr. John]].

On 1 May 2011, Laurie and a jazz quintet closed the 2011 [[Cheltenham Jazz Festival#The 2011 Programme|Cheltenham Jazz Festival]] to great acclaim.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/may/03/hugh-laurie-at-cheltenham-jazz-festival ''Hugh Laurie at Cheltenham Jazz Festival – Review''], ''The Guardian'', 3 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Laurie's eldest son Charlie played a cameo part in ''A Bit of Fry &amp; Laurie'', in the last sketch of an episode, entitled "Special Squad", as baby William. Fry and Laurie begin to "interrogate" the baby about "what he's done with the stuff", calling him a scumbag and telling him that he's "been a very naughty boy". His daughter Rebecca had a role in the film ''[[Wit (film)|Wit]]'' as five-year-old Vivian Bearing. Fry, Laurie's best friend and long-time comedy partner, was the [[best man]] at his wedding and is [[Godparent|godfather]] to his children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith|first=David|title=Doctor Hugh|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/apr/24/comment.broadcasting|accessdate=14 November 2011|newspaper=The Observer|date=23 April 2005|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He continues to have regular sessions with his [[psychotherapy|psychotherapist]].&lt;ref name="actors"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc1"/&gt; "Boredom," he commented, "is not an appropriate response to exploding cars."&lt;ref name="actors"/&gt;

Laurie admires the writings of [[P. G. Wodehouse]], explaining in a 27 May 1999 article in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' how reading Wodehouse novels had saved his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=13 May 2008|url=http://www.pgwodehousebooks.com/lauriesaved.htm|title=Hugh Laurie Wodehouse Saved my Life|publisher=[[P.G.
