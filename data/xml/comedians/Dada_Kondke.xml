'''Krishna Kondke''' (August 8, 1932 – March 14, 1998), popularly known as '''Dada Kondke''', was a [[Marathi cinema|Marathi]] actor and film producer. He was one of the most renowned personalities in Marathi film industry, famous for his [[double entendre]] dialogues in movies.

Kondke was born in a family owning a grocery shop and owners of chawls in Morbaug area of Mumbai which were let out. His family members were also foreman handling millworkers of Bombay Dyeing&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/dada-kondke-award-for-best-regional-film-introduced/articleshow/506703.cms Dada Kondke award for best regional film introduced-Pune-Cities-The Times of India&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Dada was born on [[Gokulashtami]] day and hence was named [[Krishna]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Dada Kondke was entered in the ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]'' for the highest number of films (nine) that achieved silver jubilee (running for 25 consecutive weeks).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/lifestyle/report-full-house-for-marathi-cinema-2217580|title=Marathi cinema flies high, leaves big brother Bollywood in its growth trajectory {{!}} Latest News &amp; Updates at Daily News &amp; Analysis|date=2016-05-29|website=dna|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kondke was called "Dada", an honorific Marathi term meaning "elder brother", which led to his popular name Dada Kondke. He was credited with introducing the genre of [[sex comedy]] to [[Marathi cinema]] and [[Indian cinema]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.punemirror.in/entertainment/unwind/Just-for-laughs/articleshow/51228800.cms&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Kondke was a born and raised in a cotton mill-worker family in a [[chawl]] in Naigaon, near [[Lalbaug]], [[Mumbai]]. His family originally hailed from the village of Ingavali which was in the erstwhile [[Bhor State]] near [[Pune]]. Kondke and his migrant family retained close connections to their rural roots.
As a youngster, Kondke was a rough kid who later on took up job in a local grocery retail chain called ''Apna Bazaar''. He lost most of his immediate family to unfortunate events and the grieving process changed him profoundly. These events made him focus more on the lighter side of life and make people laugh. Kondke started his entertainment career with a [[Musical ensemble|band]] and then worked as a stage actor. While working for the drama companies,  Kondke toured all over Maharashtra which helped him understand what entertainment clicked with the local population.

== Career ==

===Stage career===
Kondke was involved in cultural activities of [[Seva Dal]], a Congress party volunteers organization, where he started working in dramas. During this period came in contact with various Marathi stage personalities including writer, [[Vasant Sabnis]]. Later, Kondke started his own theatre company, and approached Sabnis to compose a drama script for him. Sabnis appreciated Dada's  performance in ''Khankhanpurcha Raja'' (literal translation, bankrupt king), and agreed to  write a modern Marathi language [[Tamasha]] or loknatya ([[folk play]]) (''Loknatya''). The drama  was named  ''Vichha Majhi Puri Kara'' (literal translation, fulfill my wish).The drama went on to play over 1500 shows all over Maharashtra and made Dada a star.

===Film career===
''Vichha Majhi Puri Kara'' got Kondke into spotlight and in 1969, he got entry into Marathi movies through a role in [[Bhalji Pendharkar]]'s movie ''Tambdi Maati'' which won the [[National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Marathi]]. He then turned producer with Songadya in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rediff.com/entertai/1998/mar/14dada.htm Rediff On The Net, Movies:A journalist remembers Dada Kondke&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Songadya'' was based on a story written by [[Vasant Sabnis]], and was directed by Govind Kulkarni. He cast himself as Namya, the simpleton who falls for the glamour of Kalavati (played by [[Usha Chavan]]) who is a dancer. Some of the other people who played major characters in this movie were [[Nilu Phule]], [[Ganpat Patil]], Sampat Nikam and Ratnamala. Kondke retained his team from ''Songadya'' and delivered his next hit [[Eakta Jeev Sadashiv]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gokulsing|first1=K. Moti (Editor)|last2=Dissanayake|first2=Wimal  (Editor)|last3=Gangar|first3=Amrit (Author)|title=Routledge handbook of Indian cinemas|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0415677742|pages=82–83|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Routledge_Handbook_of_Indian_Cinemas.html?id=djUFmlFbzFkC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kondke's story-lines were always based on the simpleton engaged in lower level occupations. For example,  Kondke portrayed himself as a ''Dhobi'' (Laundry Man) in ''Aali Angavar'', Poor Farmer in ''Songadya'', and a Police Constable in ''Pandu Havaldar''. Kondke is known for using the same team of actors, technicians and playback singers to repeat the formula for success that he believed he had got from his debut film. Many of his movies, produced under the "Kamakshi Pictures" banner, had [[Usha Chavan]] as the lead actress, Rajesh Mujumdar as screen play writer (from ''Pandu Hawaldar'' onward), [[Raam Laxman]] as music director, Jayawant Kulkarni and later [[Mahendra Kapoor]] as the male playback singer, [[Usha Mangeshkar]] as the female playback singer, and Bal Mohite as the chief assistant. Kondke often employed the veteran actor-dancer, [[Bhagwan Dada]] in dancing sequences in his films ''Aali Angavar'', ''Hyoch Navra Pahije'', ''Bot Lavin Tithe Gudgulya'', and ''Ram Ram Gangaram''.

==Political career==
[[Balasaheb Thackeray]] helped Kondke with screenings of "Songadya", a film full of sexual innuendos that many found objectionable. Thackeray's justification for supporting Kondke was that he was a Marathi "manoos" (man). In return, Kondke, with Gajanan Shirke, helped found the ''Chitrapat Shakha'', [[Shiv Sena]]'s culture police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sex, lies and a super-censor|url=http://www.thehindu.com/2002/09/15/stories/2002091503601600.htm|accessdate=20 February 2017|issue=Sunday, Sep 15|publisher=The Hindu|date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Dada Kondake was impressed with Balasaheb Thackeray's charisma and had toured Maharashtra to set up the roots of Shiv Sena, political party lead by Thackeray. Kondke was very active Shiv sainik and was able to influence many areas of rural Maharashtra due to his popularity and way of making fiery speeches to impress the masses.

== Personal life ==
He was married to his wife Nalini but they later got divorced. He did not remarry.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} On September 30, 1997, Kondke suffered a [[heart attack]] at his residence Rama Niwas in [[Dadar]], Mumbai. He was rushed to Shushrusha Nursing Home, where he was declared dead on admission. At the time, Kondke was working on the film ''Jaraa Dheer Dhara'' with [[Usha Chavan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rediff.com/entertai/1998/mar/14dada.htm Rediff On The Net, Movies:A journalist remembers Dada Kondke&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
