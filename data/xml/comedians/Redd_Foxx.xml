'''John Elroy Sanford'''&lt;ref name="starr" /&gt; (December 9, 1922 – October 11, 1991), better known by his [[stage name|screen name]] '''Redd Foxx''', was an [[Americans|American]] stand-up comedian and actor, best remembered for his explicit [[comedy album|comedy records]] and his starring role on the 1970s [[situation comedy|sitcom]] ''[[Sanford and Son]]''.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Redd Foxx, Cantankerous Master of Bawdy Humor, Is Dead at 68|first=Nick|last=Ravo|date=October 13, 1991|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/10/13/nyregion/redd-foxx-cantankerous-master-of-bawdy-humor-is-dead-at-68.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foxx gained notoriety with his raunchy [[nightclub act]]s during the 1950s and 1960s. Known as the "King of the Party Records", he performed on [[Redd Foxx#Discography|more than 50 records]] in his lifetime. He also starred in ''[[Sanford (TV series)|Sanford]]'', ''[[The Redd Foxx Show]]'' and ''[[The Royal Family (TV series)|The Royal Family]]''. His film projects included ''[[All the Fine Young Cannibals]]'' (1960), ''[[Cotton Comes to Harlem]]'' (1970), ''[[Norman... Is That You?]]'' (1976) and ''[[Harlem Nights]]'' (1989).

In 2004, ''[[Comedy Central]] Presents: 100 Greatest Stand-ups of All Time'' ranked Foxx as the 24th best [[stand-up comedy|stand-up comedian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode | title = Comedy Central's 100 Greatest Stand-Ups of All Time | url = http://www.comedycentral.com/tv_shows/100greatest/list.jhtml | access-date = 21 September 2016 | series = Comedy Central Presents | network = Comedy Central | date = 17 April 2004 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20040605175309/http://www.comedycentral.com/tv_shows/100greatest/list.jhtml | archivedate = 5 June 2004 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Foxx not only influenced many comedians,&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; but was often portrayed in [[popular culture]] as well, mainly as a result of his famous [[catchphrase]]s, [[body language]] and [[facial expression]]s exhibited on ''Sanford and Son''. During the show's five year run, Foxx won a [[Golden Globe Award]] and received an additional three nominations, along with three [[Primetime Emmy Award]] nominations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Redd Foxx|url=http://www.goldenglobes.com/person/redd-foxx|website=GoldenGlobes.org|publisher=[[Hollywood Foreign Press Association]]|accessdate=11 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Redd Foxx|url=http://www.emmys.com/bios/redd-foxx|website=Emmys.com|publisher=[[Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences]]|accessdate=11 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Redd Foxx was born '''John Elroy Sanford''' on December 9, 1922, in [[St. Louis, Missouri]] and raised on [[Chicago]]'s [[South Side (Chicago)|South Side]]. His father, Fred Sanford, an [[electrician]] and auto mechanic from [[Hickman, Kentucky]], left his family when Foxx was four years old. He was raised by his half-[[Seminole Indian]] mother, Mary Hughes from [[Ellisville, Mississippi]], his grandmother and his [[Minister of religion|minister]]. Foxx attended [[DuSable High School]] in Chicago's Bronzeville neighborhood with future Chicago mayor [[Harold Washington]]. Foxx had an older brother, Fred G. Sanford Jr., who provided the name for his character on ''Sanford and Son''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=a7vcX2uNPK4C&amp;pg=PA18&amp;dq=Redd+Foxx+%22draft%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7u4RT4m3KoHd0QHg1tDGAw&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwAg#v=snippet&amp;q=rechristened%20Fred&amp;f=false Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; On July 27, 1939, Foxx performed on the [[Major Bowes Amateur Hour]] radio show as part of the Jump Swinging Six. 

In the 1940s, he met Malcolm Little, later known as [[Malcolm X]]. In [[The Autobiography of Malcolm X|Malcolm's autobiography]], Foxx is referred to as "Chicago Red, the funniest dishwasher on this earth." He earned the nickname because of his reddish hair and complexion.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; During [[World War II]], Foxx dodged the [[Selective Training and Service Act of 1940|draft]] by eating half a bar of soap before his physical, a trick that resulted in [[palpitation|heart palpitations]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=a7vcX2uNPK4C&amp;pg=PA18&amp;dq=Redd+Foxx+%22draft%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7u4RT4m3KoHd0QHg1tDGAw&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Redd%20Foxx%20%22draft%22&amp;f=false Black and Blue: The Redd Foxx Story]&lt;/ref&gt; On September 30, 1946, Foxx recorded five songs for the [[Savoy Records|Savoy label]] under the direction of [[Teddy Reig]].

==Career==
===Nightclub act===
Foxx gained notoriety with his raunchy [[nightclub]] act. After performing on the East Coast, his big break came after singer [[Dinah Washington]] insisted that he come to [[Los Angeles]], where [[Dootsie Williams]] of Dootone records caught his act at the Brass Rail nightclub. Foxx was one of the first black comics to play to white audiences on the [[Las Vegas Strip]]. He was signed to a long-term contract and released a series of comedy albums that quickly became cult favorites.&lt;ref name="People-28Oct1991"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Goodman |first=Mark |author= |authorlink= |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |date=October 28, 1991 |year= |month= |title=Redd Foxx exits, laughing|journal=People |volume=36 |series= |issue=16 |page= |pages= |publisher= |issn= |pmid= |pmc= |doi= |bibcode= |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20111147,00.html |accessdate=October 11, 2010 |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Sanford and Son''===
{{Main article|Sanford and Son}} 
Foxx achieved his most widespread fame starring in the television [[sitcom]] ''Sanford and Son,''&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; an adaptation of the [[BBC]] series ''[[Steptoe and Son]]''. He used his starring role on ''Sanford and Son'' to help get jobs for his acquaintances such as [[LaWanda Page]], [[Slappy White]], [[Gregory Sierra]], [[Don Bexley]], [[Beah Richards]], [[Stymie Beard]], Leroy Daniels, Ernest Mayhand and [[Pat Morita|Noriyuki "Pat" Morita]].

The series premiered on the [[NBC|NBC television network]] on January 14, 1972 and was broadcast for six seasons. The final episode aired on March 25, 1977. Foxx played the role of Fred G. Sanford ("Fred Sanford" was actually Foxx's father's and brother's name), while Foxx's co-star [[Demond Wilson]] played the role of his son Lamont. In this sitcom, Fred and Lamont were owners of a junk/salvage store in [[Watts, Los Angeles|Watts]] who dealt with many humorous situations that would arise. The series was notable for its [[ethnic joke|racial humor]] and overt [[prejudice]]s which helped [[Sanford and Son#Production notes|redefine the genre]] of [[black sitcom|black situation comedy]].

The show also had several [[running gag]]s. When angry with Lamont, Fred would often say "You big dummy" or would often fake heart attacks by putting his hand on his chest and saying (usually while looking up at the sky) "It's [[Sanford and Son#The Big One|the big one]], I'm coming to join ya honey/Elizabeth" (referring to his late wife). Fred would also complain about having [[arthritis|"arthur-itis"]] to get out of working by showing Lamont his cramped hand. Foxx depicted a character in his 60s, although in real-life he was a decade younger.

Demond Wilson was asked whether he kept in touch with everybody from ''Sanford &amp; Son'', especially the series' star himself, after the series was canceled: "No. I saw Redd Foxx once before he died, circa 1983, and I never saw him again. At the time I was playing tennis at the Malibu Racquet Club and I was approached by some producers about doing a Redd Foxx 50th Anniversary Special. I hadn’t spoken to him since 1977, and I called the club where (Redd) was playing. And we met at Redd’s office, but he was less than affable. I told those guys it was a bad idea. I never had a cross word with him. People say I’m protective of Redd Foxx in my book (Second Banana, Wilson’s memoir of the Sanford years). I had no animosity toward Foxx for (quitting the show in 1977) because I had a million dollar contract at CBS to do Baby I’m Back. My hurt was that he didn’t come to me about throwing the towel in - I found out in the hallway at NBC from a newscaster. I forgave him and I loved Redd, but I never forgot that. The love was there. You can watch any episode and see that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beachcomberdestin.com/destin/article-966-qa-with-demond-wilson.html|title=Q&amp;A With Demond Wilson|publisher=BeachcomberDestin.com|date=January 15, 2014| accessdate=August 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-''Sanford and Son'' career===
[[File:Redd Foxx 1977.JPG|thumb|left|180px|Photo of Redd Foxx in 1977.]] In 1977, Foxx left ''Sanford and Son'', after six seasons (the show was canceled with his departure) to star in a short-lived ABC [[variety show]]. In 1980 he was back playing [[Fred G. Sanford]] in a short-lived [[revival (television)|revival]]/[[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]], ''[[Sanford (TV series)|Sanford]]''. In 1986, he returned to television in the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] series ''[[The Redd Foxx Show]]'', which was cancelled after 12 episodes because of low ratings. Foxx appeared as an ''[[Obi-Wan Kenobi]]''-like character in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' special of the ''[[Donny &amp; Marie (1976 TV series)|Donny &amp; Marie]]'' show. In an homage to his show, he mentioned the planet Sanford, which has no sun. Foxx made a comeback with the series ''[[The Royal Family (TV series)|The Royal Family]]'', in which he co-starred with [[Della Reese]].

==Personal life==
===Marriages===
Redd Foxx was married four times. His first marriage was to Evelyn Killebrew in 1948 and ended in divorce in 1951. His second marriage in 1956 was to Betty Jean Harris, a [[showgirl]] and dancer, who was a colleague of [[LaWanda Page]] (later to be Foxx's TV rival [[Aunt Esther]] on ''[[Sanford and Son]]''). Foxx adopted Harris's nine-year-old daughter Debraca, who assumed the surname "Foxx". This marriage ended in divorce in 1975. Foxx next wed Korean-American Yun Chi Chung in 1976, but the marriage ended in 1981. At the time of his death, Foxx was married to Ka Ho Cho, who used the name Ka Ho Foxx.&lt;ref name="aolnews.com"&gt;[http://www.aolnews.com/nation/article/red-foxxs-life-story-is-it-worth-enough-to-settle-his-estates-debt/19383405 Steve Friess, "Trying to Get Foxx's Estate Out of the Redd", AOL News, March 7, 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100520080623/http://www.aolnews.com/nation/article/red-foxxs-life-story-is-it-worth-enough-to-settle-his-estates-debt/19383405 |date=May 20, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Financial and tax problems ===
According to ''[[People Magazine]]'', "Foxx reportedly once earned $4 million in a single year, but depleted his fortune with a lavish lifestyle, exacerbated by what he called 'very bad management.{{'"}} Contributing to his problems was a 1981 divorce settlement of $300,000 paid to his third wife. In 1983 he filed for bankruptcy, with proceedings continuing at least through 1989.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20116272,00.html ''People Magazine'', December 18, 1989.]&lt;/ref&gt; The IRS filed tax liens against Redd Foxx's property for income taxes he owed for the years 1983 to 1986 totaling $755,166.21.  On November 28, 1989, the IRS seized his home in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] and seven vehicles (including a 1927 [[Model T]], a 1975 [[Panther J72]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=0dwDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA64&amp;lpg=PA64&amp;dq=redd+foxx+panther&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=X7ryE5doSz&amp;sig=8rk79jLoQczeWXi57Fu7wov7wwc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=2hH0S-vqGpC6swP8q5GNDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CBcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=redd%20foxx%20panther&amp;f=false ''Ebony'' magazine article (September 1976)]&lt;/ref&gt; a 1983 [[Zimmer (automobile)|Zimmer]], and a [[Vespa|Vespa motor scooter]]) to pay the taxes which by then had grown to $996,630, including penalties and interest. Agents also seized "$12,769 in cash and a dozen guns, including a semiautomatic pistol," among some 300 items in total, reportedly leaving only Foxx's bed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1989-11-29/entertainment/ca-299_1_redd-foxx-s-home ''Los Angeles Times'', November 29, 1989.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1989-12-06/news/vw-396_1_redd-foxx ''Los Angeles Times'', December 6, 1989.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1990-05-02/news/9005025492_1_redd-foxx-auctioned-las-vegas Orlando Sentinel May 2, 1990]&lt;/ref&gt;
Foxx stated that the IRS "took my necklace and the ID bracelet off my wrist and the money out of my pocket&amp;nbsp;... I was treated like I wasn't human at all."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20116272,00.html ''People Magazine''], December 18, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been reported that, at the time of his death in 1991, Foxx owed more than $3.6 million in taxes.&lt;ref name="aolnews.com"/&gt;

==Death==
On October 11, 1991, during a break from rehearsals for ''The Royal Family'', he suffered a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] on the set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://onstageandbackstage.wordpress.com/2011/12/09/ill-be-back-the-story-of-redd-foxx/ |title='I’ll Be Back': The Story of Redd Foxx |author= |date=9 December 2011 |work=Onstage &amp; Backstage |publisher= |accessdate=2 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ingram&gt;Ingram, Billy, ''TVparty!: Television's Untold Tales'', Bonus Books, 2002, p. 262. {{ISBN|1-56625-184-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Della Reese, Foxx was about to have an interview with ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'' when he was called onto the set to practice a scene. An angry Foxx did as he was asked but as soon as he finished he collapsed to the floor. Reese said that nobody initially suspected anything was wrong; Foxx was famous for his fake heart attack shtick on ''Sanford and Son'' and, as Reese recalled, was skilled at doing pratfalls. When Foxx did not immediately get up, Reese rushed over to check on him. &lt;ref&gt;https://blackdoctor.org/486916/della-reese-describes-redd-foxxs-last-breath-and-what-really-killed-him/&lt;/ref&gt; When she leaned down to Foxx as he was on the ground, Foxx said, "Get my wife" repeatedly and went into cardiac arrest.{{cn|date=August 2018}}  According to Joshua Rich at ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', "It was an end so ironic that for a brief moment cast mates figured Foxx&amp;nbsp;– whose 1970s TV character often faked heart attacks&amp;nbsp;– was kidding when he grabbed a chair and fell to the floor."&lt;ref name="rich1998"&gt;Rich, Joshua (October 9, 1998). [http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,285162,00.html Exit Laughing.] ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Foxx, who had temporarily been brought back to life while being treated initially, was taken to [[Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center|Queen Of Angels Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center]], where he succumbed to the attack and died that night at the age of 68.&lt;ref name="jet1991"&gt;Staff report (October 28, 1991).

His mother, Mary Carson (1903–1993), outlived Foxx and died two years later, in 1993. She was buried just to the right of her famed son.

==Influence==
Comedian and actor [[Richard Pryor]] cited Redd Foxx as an influence.&lt;ref&gt;'Pryor Convictions and Other Life Sentences', by Richard Pryor with Todd Gold.&lt;/ref&gt; "He gave me inspiration and encouragement so I could be more me", Pryor told ''Ebony'' magazine in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-10-12/local/me-105_1_redd-foxx/2|title=Redd Foxx, TV's 'Sanford,' Dies of Heart Attack at 68 :  Entertainment: Comedian is stricken while rehearsing new show, 'The Royal Family.'|last=MERINA|first=VICTOR|date=1991-10-12|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-11-11|last2=DIZON|first2=LILY|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comedian [[Chris Rock]] cites Redd Foxx as an influence.

==Portrayals of Foxx in popular media==
In 1990, in the first-ever episode of ''[[In Living Color]]'', in reference to Foxx's financial troubles, Foxx was portrayed by [[Damon Wayans]], who is making a public service announcement to encourage people to pay their taxes. In the film ''[[Why Do Fools Fall in Love (film)|Why Do Fools Fall in Love]]'', Foxx is portrayed by [[Aries Spears]]. He is shown performing a stand-up comedy routine. In the animated television series ''[[Family Guy]]'' parody of ''[[Star Wars]]'' episode "[[Blue Harvest (Family Guy)|Blue Harvest]]", Redd Foxx appears very briefly as an X-wing pilot. When his ship is shot down, he cries "I'm coming Elizabeth!" before dying. In addition to this, he has been parodied on ''Family Guy'' by [[Francis Griffin]] acting as Foxx's ''Sanford and Son'' character.

Foxx was meant to be featured in the [[MTV]] show ''[[Celebrity Deathmatch]]'', advertised as taking on [[Jamie Foxx]] in the episode "When Animals Attack". Instead of Redd Foxx though, Jamie Foxx fought [[Ray Charles]]. In the ''[[The Boondocks (TV series)|Boondocks]]'' episode "[[Stinkmeaner 3: The Hateocracy]]" he is portrayed as Lord Rufus Crabmiser, one of Stinkmeaner's old friends coming to kill the Freeman family. Childhood friend and ''Sanford &amp; Son'' co-star Lawanda Page is also portrayed in the same episode as Lady Esmeralda Gripenasty.

Redd Foxx appears as a minor character in the 2009 ''[[James Ellroy]]'' novel ''[[Blood's a Rover]]''.
