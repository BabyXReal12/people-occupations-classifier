Since then he has starred in a number of films and television shows, some of which he has co-produced or co-written, including ''[[The Last Boy Scout]]'' and ''[[Major Payne]]'', and the sitcom ''[[My Wife and Kids]]''.

== Career ==
Damon started doing stand-up comedy in 1982. His earliest film appearance was a brief cameo as an effeminate hotel employee in the 1984 [[Eddie Murphy]] film ''[[Beverly Hills Cop]]''. From 1985 to 1986, he appeared on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' as a featured performer, before getting fired after just seven episodes for improvising during a live sketch, playing his character as a flamboyant gay cop instead of a straight cop. Wayans later claimed that he wanted to be fired due to lack of creative freedom and screen time. Wayans further explained that [[Lorne Michaels]] did not want Wayans to do too much too soon and begin drawing unfair comparisons to Eddie Murphy who had just left the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McCarthy|first1=Sean L.|title=What Damon Wayans said in 2015 about getting fired at SNL, In Living Color, Kevin Hart, social media, and yes, Bill Cosby|url=http://thecomicscomic.com/2015/09/08/what-damon-wayans-said-in-2015-about-getting-fired-at-snl-in-living-color-kevin-hart-social-media-and-yes-bill-cosby/|accessdate=12 October 2017|work=The Comic's Comic|date=8 September 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171013064820/http://thecomicscomic.com/2015/09/08/what-damon-wayans-said-in-2015-about-getting-fired-at-snl-in-living-color-kevin-hart-social-media-and-yes-bill-cosby/|archivedate=October 13, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also appeared in the syndicated TV series ''[[Solid Gold (TV series)|Solid Gold]]'' during the 1980s as a comedian.

With his brother Keenen, Wayans created the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] sketch comedy series ''[[In Living Color]]'', which had a mostly African-American cast. The show went on the air in 1990. It continued running until 1994, although Wayans left the show in 1992 to pursue a film career.

After ''In Living Color'', he starred in films such as ''[[Mo' Money]]'', ''[[The Last Boy Scout]]'', ''[[Major Payne]]'', ''[[Celtic Pride]]'', ''[[Bulletproof (1996 film)|Bulletproof]]'', and ''[[The Great White Hype]]'', and wrote and starred in the film ''[[Blankman]]''. He also appeared in [[Janet Jackson]]'s video "[[The Best Things in Life Are Free]]" and was considered for the role of [[The Riddler]] in ''[[Batman Forever]]'' (the role went to [[Jim Carrey]], his co-star from ''In Living Color'' and ''[[Earth Girls Are Easy]]'').

In 1996, he produced ''[[Waynehead]]'', a short-lived cartoon for the [[The WB Television Network|WB]], loosely based on his own childhood growing up in a large family, starring a poor boy with a club foot. The show only lasted a season due to poor ratings. From 1997 to 1998, he was the executive producer of ''[[413 Hope St.]]'', a short-lived drama on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX network]] starring [[Richard Roundtree]] and [[Jesse L. Martin]].

In 1998, he starred in the short-lived comedy TV series ''[[Damon (TV series)|Damon]]'', in which he played a Chicago detective. It aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]. In 1999, his ''[[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' bestselling]] book ''Bootleg'' with co-author David Asbery was published; it is a humorous compilation of his observations about family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/COMMUNITY/transcripts/wayans.html|title=CNN - Chatpage - Books - Damon Wayans|website=www.cnn.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206004437/http://www.cnn.com/COMMUNITY/transcripts/wayans.html|archivedate=December 6, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wayans starred in the ABC comedy series ''[[My Wife and Kids]]'' from 2001 to 2005.

In 2006, he produced and starred in the [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] [[sketch comedy]] series ''[[The Underground (TV series)|The Underground]]'', which also featured his son, [[Damon Wayans Jr.|Damon Jr.]] He also hosted the 2006 [[BET Awards]].

In 2011, he also added author of a serious fictional novel to his credits with "Red Hats" which is the story of a suicidal 65-year-old woman who finds friendship and happiness when she joins the [[Red Hat Society]].

As of 2014, Wayans continues to perform stand up comedy and has developed apps with his company of freelancers "MIMS" (Money in My Sleep).&lt;ref name="Tri" /&gt; The company created applications such as Flick Dat, Diddeo&lt;ref&gt;[http://joonbug.com/national/almostfamous/Interview-Damon-Wayans-Sr/FIdyHTOxcY0 Interview: Damon Wayans Sr.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826115610/http://joonbug.com/national/almostfamous/Interview-Damon-Wayans-Sr/FIdyHTOxcY0 |date=August 26, 2014 }} Joonbug.com February 14, 2014. Accessed August 25, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; and VHedz.&lt;ref name="Tri" /&gt;

On November 12, 2015, at the Irvine Improv, Damon Wayans announced his retirement from stand-up commencing December 2015.

In September 2015, Wayans defended American comedian [[Bill Cosby]] from his [[Bill Cosby sexual assault allegations|sexual assault accusations]], stating, "It's a money hustle". He continued, saying, "Forty years – listen, how big is his penis that it gives you amnesia for 40 years? If you listen to them talk, they go, 'Well, the first time…' The first time? Bitch, how many times did it happen? Just listen to what they're saying and some of them really is unrape-able. I look at them and go, 'You don't want that.
