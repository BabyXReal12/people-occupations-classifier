'''Sheldon Leonard Berman''' (February 3, 1925 – September 1, 2017) was an American comedian, actor, writer, teacher, lecturer and poet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/shelley-berman-dead-comic-actor-719716|title=Shelley Berman, Famed 'Sit-Down' Comedian, Dies at 92|author=|date=September 1, 2017|website=hollywoodreporter.com|accessdate=September 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his comedic career, Berman was awarded three gold records and he won the first [[Grammy Award]] for a [[Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album|spoken comedy recording]] in [[2nd Annual Grammy Awards|1959]].&lt;ref name="Grammy"/&gt; He played [[Larry David]]'s father on ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'', a role for which he received a 2008 [[Emmy Award]] nomination.&lt;ref name="NBC"/&gt;

He taught humor writing at the [[University of Southern California]] for more than 20 years.&lt;ref name="USC"/&gt;

==Early life and education==
Berman was born in Chicago, the son of Irene (née Marks) and Nathan Berman. He was Jewish.&lt;ref name="interfaithfamily1"&gt;[http://www.interfaithfamily.com/arts_and_entertainment/popular_culture/Interfaith_Celebrities_Dancing_with_the_Stars_of_David.shtml Interfaith Celebrities: Dancing with the Stars of David – InterfaithFamily.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

He served in the Navy during World War II.&lt;ref name = "times" /&gt; He then enrolled in Chicago's [[Goodman Theatre]] as a drama student. There he met fellow student Sarah Herman; they married in 1947.&lt;ref name="times"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-me-shelley-berman-2050-story.html|title=Shelley Berman, angst-filled comedian who pioneered standup (or sit-down) comedy, dies at 92|last=McLellan|first=Dennis|date=September 1, 2017|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His acting career began with an acting company in [[Woodstock, Illinois]].&lt;ref name="interfaithfamily1"/&gt; Leaving Woodstock in 1949, Shelley and his wife Sarah made their way to [[New York City]].&lt;ref name="LAT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-me-shelley-berman-2050-story.html|title=Shelley Berman, angst-filled comedian who pioneered standup (or sit-down) comedy, dies at 92|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=September 1, 2017|accessdate=September 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; To make ends meet, Berman found employment as a social director, cab driver, speech teacher, assistant manager of a drug store, and a dance instructor at [[Arthur Murray]] Dance Studios.&lt;ref name="LAT"/&gt;

Eventually, Berman found work as a sketch writer for ''[[The Steve Allen Plymouth Show]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kinevideo.net/comedy_variety.php|title=Vintage Television|publisher=Kine Video|accessdate=September 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Early career===
Berman began as a straight actor, receiving his training at the Goodman Theatre in Chicago, honing his acting skills in stock companies in and around Chicago and New York City.&lt;ref name="NYTobit"/&gt;

In the mid-1950s, he became a member of Chicago's [[Compass Players]], which later evolved into [[The Second City]].&lt;ref name="TSC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/chicago/article/The-Second-City-Mourns-the-Loss-of-Comedic-Legend-Shelley-Berman-20170901|title=The Second City Mourns the Loss of Shelley Berman|publisher=Broadway World|accessdate=September 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; While performing improvised sketches with Compass, Berman began to develop solo pieces, often employing an imaginary telephone to take the place of an onstage partner.&lt;ref name="TSC"/&gt;

===Nightclubs and live performances===
In 1957, Berman was hired as a comedian at [[Mister Kelly's]] in Chicago, which led to other nightclub bookings, and a recording contract with [[Verve Records]].&lt;ref name="Chicago"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chicago.suntimes.com/entertainment/comedian-shelley-berman-who-trained-in-chicago-dies-at-92/|title=Comedian Shelley Berman, who got his start in Chicago, dies at 92|publisher=[[The Chicago Sun-Times]]|date=September 1, 2017|accessdate=September 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His comedy albums earned him three gold records and he won the first [[Grammy Award]] for a [[Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album|spoken comedy recording]].&lt;ref name="Grammy"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/news/shelley-berman-grammy-winning-comedian-dies|title=Grammy Winner Shelley Berman Dies|publisher=Grammy|accessdate=September 1, 2017|date=September 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berman appeared on numerous television specials and all of the major variety shows of the day.&lt;ref name="Grammy"/&gt;

Berman's voice was used as the inspiration for the voice of the [[Hanna-Barbera]] cartoon character [[Yakky Doodle#Main characters|Fibber Fox]], performed by [[Daws Butler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yowpyowp.blogspot.com/2017/08/yakky-doodle-in-foxy-duck.html|title=Yakky Doddle in Foxy Duck|publisher=Yowp|accessdate=September 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Berman married Sarah Herman on April 19, 1947. The two met while they were studying acting at Chicago's Goodman Theatre.&lt;ref name="TWP"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/celebrities/shelley-berman-comedian-bard-of-everyday-life-dies-at-92/2017/09/01/6d814592-8f25-11e7-9c53-6a169beb0953_story.html|title=Shelley Berman, comedian-bard of everyday life, has died|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|date=September 1, 2017|accessdate=September 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1960s, Berman and wife Sarah adopted two children, son Joshua and daughter Rachel.&lt;ref name="NYTobit"/&gt; The Bermans were planning Joshua's [[bar mitzvah]] when he was diagnosed with a brain tumor. Joshua died on October 29, 1977 at age 12.&lt;ref name="TWP"/&gt;

Berman and his wife were both enthusiastic supporters of the Motion Picture and Television Fund (located in Woodland Hills, California), a charitable organization that offers assistance and care to those in the motion picture and television industries with limited or no resources, and contributed their time and resources to the benefit of the facilities and the residents.&lt;ref name="NBC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/shelley-berman-stand-comic-curb-your-enthusiasm-actor-dies-92-n798201|title=

In the 1980s, the Chamber of Commerce in Canoga Park, California selected Berman to be one of the celebrities to serve a term as honorary mayor of Canoga Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/176310409/|title=The Los Angeles Times from Los Angeles, California · Page 270|publisher=[[The Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=September 1, 2017|date=September 9, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Accusation of plagiarism ===
In a 2012 podcast interview with [[Marc Maron]], 87-year-old Berman accused comedian [[Bob Newhart]] of plagiarizing his improvisational telephone routine style, describing its genesis and saying it was a "very special technique that couldn't really be imitated.&lt;ref name="MMSB"/&gt; It could be stolen. And it was." He continued, "I was coming to work at night and a guy stopped his car, passed me by, and said 'Hey, Shelley! There's a guy [who] stole your act!'"&lt;ref name="MMSB"/&gt; When asked by Maron if it was done maliciously, Berman replied, "Maliciously? He wouldn't do it maliciously. Nobody does that. But he did it to make a living. And he became a star."&lt;ref name="Deadpan"/&gt;

Berman later added, "I thought it was a rotten thing to do. I thought the agents who sold him — I thought they were just as guilty as everybody else. But, my God, to go into a town and do my show, and the critics saying that I borrowed some stuff from Newhart..."&lt;ref name="MMSB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episodes/episode_332_-_shelley_berman|title=Episode 332 – Shelley Berman|author=|date=|website=wtfpod.com|accessdate=September 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked in interviews about the telephone issue, Bob Newhart noted that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Shelley Berman did it before I did it. [[Nichols and May|Mike (Nichols) and Elaine (May)]] did a version of it. There was a thing called '[[Cohen on the Telephone]],' which was a very, very early recording by Edison [Records] of a guy on the phone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thorn |first=Jesse |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/bob-newhart-talks-about-standup-sitcoms-and-why-he,75185/ |title=Bob Newhart talks about stand-up, sitcoms, and why he stays busy &amp;#124; Comedy &amp;#124; Interview |publisher=The A.V. Club |date=May 16, 2012|accessdate=February 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;...George Jessel had a radio show...At the end, he would call up his mother and tell her how the show had gone. As a kid growing up, I remember listening to him and he would call his mother up and say, 'Mama, this is Georgie'" – he paused, skillfully – "'from the money.'"&lt;ref name="Deadpan"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/12/arts/television/12bob.html|title=For Bob Newhart, Dean of Deadpan, the Laughs Go On|first=Ned|last=Martel|date=April 12, 2005|work=The New York Times|accessdate=September 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On his website, comedy writer [[Mark Rothman]] discussed the history of comic "telephone" monologists:
::As far back as the 1920s, George Jessel was doing phone conversations with his mother in vaudeville, with the opening line "Hello Mama? This is Georgie." In the 30s and 40s there was this radio comedienne named [[Arlene Harris]], often referred to as Arlene "Chatterbox" Harris, who did telephone monologues to one of her "friends." The only reason I know about this is that she was featured doing one of them on an episode of ''The Dick Van Dyke Show'' that featured many old radio entertainers. And she performed one of them. Brilliantly. Then, in the 50s, a great comedienne, [[Betty Walker]], made about a zillion appearances on ''The Ed Sullivan Show'', doing essentially the same kind of act as Arlene Harris, talking to her friend Ceil. Only it was intensively Yiddishified. They talked about marriage and children, and how impossible it was to maintain both. Whereas Arlene Harris was white bread, Betty Walker was challah. Betty Walker's catchphrase was "Ceil....Ceil....Ceeeee—ullll!!!! Really, really funny. Also brilliant. All of this pre-dated Shelley Berman. Even Mike Nichols and Elaine May, who were contemporaries of Berman's at Second City, engaged in telephone dialogues, with very similar styled material. And who's more brilliant than them?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://markrothmansblog.blogspot.com/2013/03/the-telephone-hour.html | title=The Telephone Hour. | date=March 28, 2013 | accessdate=March 23, 2016 | author=Rothman, Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Berman died from [[Alzheimer's disease]]-related complications at his home in [[Bell Canyon, California]], in the early morning of September 1, 2017.&lt;ref name="NYTobit"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/01/obituaries/shelley-berman-dead-comedian.html|title=Shelley Berman, Stand-Up Comic Who Skewered Modern Life, Dies at 92|first=Peter|last=Keepnews|date=September 1, 2017|work=The New York Times|accessdate=September 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was 92 years old. His archive was donated to the [[National Comedy Center]] in [[Jamestown, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.post-journal.com/news/local-news/2018/02/national-comedy-center-acquires-archive-comedian-shelley-berman/|title=National Comedy Center Acquires Archive Comedian Shelley Berman|newspaper=[[The Post-Journal]]|date=February 1, 2018|accessdate=February 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comedian [[Steve Martin]] praised Berman on Twitter, thanking him for "changing modern stand-up [comedy]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/SteveMartinToGo/status/903660928301858816|title=Steve Martin on Twitter|publisher=[[Twitter]]|date=September 1, 2017|accessdate=September 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
