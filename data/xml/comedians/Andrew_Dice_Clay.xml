Clay has been in several films and television shows, and has released a number of stand-up comedy albums. He continues to focus on acting while still touring and performing his stand-up.

==Early life==

At five, Clay was doing impressions and entertaining his family in his living room. At around seven, he took up the drums following his growing interest in "that swinging, big band sound [...] Anybody can play rock, but jazz, man, that was it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/186215526/|title=Dice takes his chops|date=3 June 1988|newspaper=Philadelphia Daily News|page=42|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|subscription=yes|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name name=latimes1987/&gt; Clay attended [[James Madison High School (Brooklyn)|James Madison High School]] in Brooklyn and as a teenager worked as a drummer on the [[Catskill Mountains]] circuit in the 1970s playing bat mitzvahs and weddings under the name Clay Silvers.&lt;ref name=latimes1990/&gt;&lt;ref name=desmoines1992&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/132063947/|title=A Dicey situation|first=Deborah|last=Cushman|date=5 November 1992|newspaper=The Des Moines Register|page=59|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|subscription=yes|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name name=latimes1987/&gt; Upon returning to New York City, he failed to form a big band of his own. He pursued higher education but dropped out to become a full-time comedian.&lt;ref name=desmoines1992/&gt;&lt;ref name name=latimes1987/&gt; Clay cites [[Elvis Presley]], [[Fonzie]], [[John Travolta]], and [[Sylvester Stallone]] as his heroes.&lt;ref name=latimes1990/&gt;

==Career==
===Early career===
Clay began his stand-up career in 1978 when he auditioned at Pips comedy club in Sheepshead Bay, which turned into a headline spot at the venue the following week, billed as Andrew Clay.&lt;ref name=latimes1990/&gt; He started with an act mainly of impressions, which included a character named "The Diceman" based on [[Jerry Lewis]] as [[Buddy Love]] from ''[[The Nutty Professor]]'' which transformed into [[John Travolta]] in ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]''.&lt;ref name=desmoines1992/&gt; It took him three weeks to prepare the act.&lt;ref name name=latimes1987/&gt; A picture of him on stage during his early sets at Pips was described: "[Clay] In a baggy white shirt, pants rolled up to his knees and a pair of thick glasses", with a black leather jacket underneath the shirt so he could seamlessly switch to his Travolta character when the lights went out.&lt;ref name=latimes1990/&gt; With his new act, Clay graduated to larger and more prestigious comedy venues including [[The Improv]], [[Catch a Rising Star (comedy clubs)|Catch a Rising Star]], and [[Dangerfield's]].&lt;ref name=desmoines1992/&gt; He recalled his father being supportive of his act during one performance at the latter. "He knew it was different right off the bat [...] He saw it worked". The persona was more of a shock to his mother, but she got used to it and he recalled her laughing at his jokes.&lt;ref name=latimes1990/&gt;

By 1980, Clay had relocated to Los Angeles and landed work at the [[Comedy Store]], owned by [[Mitzi Shore]], where he changed his stage name to Andrew Clay.&lt;ref name=latimes1990/&gt;&lt;ref name=desmoines1992/&gt; His sets were not an instant hit, and because of his dirty act and her unwillingness to have other comics follow him, Shore had Clay perform at late hours, resorting for him "to wait and perform for ten drunks".&lt;ref name=latimes1990/&gt; In 1982, Clay landed his first film role, appearing in ''[[Wacko (film)|Wacko]]''.&lt;ref name=desmoines1992/&gt; In 1983, Clay added the "Diceman" moniker to his name and no longer relied on impressions of other notable figures, instead creating an alter ego based on his heroes.&lt;ref name=latimes1990/&gt;&lt;ref name=desmoines1992/&gt; He first used the act at the Comedy Store after he was asked to fill in for a comic who cancelled their spot. He said: "I didn't have my Jerry Lewis stuff with me, so I just winged it, saying whatever popped in my head".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/152647097/|title=Crude Andrew Dice Clay at Bally's|date=22 August 1991|newspaper=Reno Gazette-Journal|page=88|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|subscription=yes|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His performances at the venue led to his first sitcom roles with appearances on ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'' and ''[[Diff'rent Strokes]]'', and feature-length films, including ''[[Making the Grade (film)|Making the Grade]]'' (1984), ''[[Pretty in Pink]]'' (1986), and ''[[Casual Sex?]]'' (1988). A review by the ''Los Angeles Times'' critic Michael Wilmington described Clay's character in the latter, named "The Vin Man" and based on his Diceman persona, as "a macho bozo from Jersey".&lt;ref name=latimes1990/&gt;&lt;ref name=desmoines1992/&gt; From 1986 to 1988, he had a regular role as Max Goldman on ''[[Crime Story (TV series)|Crime Story]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,168450,00.html Crime Story | TV]. EW.com (2001-07-20). Retrieved October 5, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; His act included a drum solo as a tribute to [[Buddy Rich]].&lt;ref name name=latimes1987&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/404931901/|title=Comic in 1-man show at Dunes|date=30 August 1987|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|page=89|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|subscription=yes|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clay then pursued stand-up comedy full time as the Dice character.

===Breakthrough and decline===
Clay's breakthrough came in 1988 when he performed at an all-male Big Brother Association dinner event with "all of Hollywood's royalty [...] dressed in tuxedos and I show up in a black leather jacket with a flag on the back that said 'Rock and Roll'". The set was a hit; the next day, [[20th Century Fox]] offered him a film deal and entered talks with producer [[Joel Silver]].&lt;ref name=latimes1990/&gt;&lt;ref name=desmoines1992/&gt; Also in 1988, Clay performed a seven-minute set at Dangerfield's in New York City for [[Rodney Dangerfield]]'s HBO stand-up showcase special ''Nothing Goes Right'', launching him into the national spotlight.&lt;ref name=desmoines1992/&gt;

In 1989, Clay was named Comedy Act of the Year by readers of ''Performance'' magazine.&lt;ref name=desmoines1992/&gt; In March 1989, he released his debut comedy album ''[[Dice (album)|Dice]]'', which went on to reach gold certification by the [[RIAA]] for selling over 500,000 copies in the US.&lt;ref name=journal1991&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/163512349/|title=The Dice man cometh|date=12 December 1991|newspaper=The Journal News|page=5|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|subscription=yes|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The incident led to [[MTV]] imposing a lifetime ban on Clay from appearing on the network.&lt;ref name=tampa1994/&gt; The ban was lifted in 2011.

In December 1989, Clay performed two unadvertised, largely improvised sets at Dangerfield's, which were recorded for his second comedy album, ''[[The Day the Laughter Died]]'', produced by [[Rick Rubin]]. Released in March 1990 on [[Geffen Records]], the album sold 250,000 copies in seven weeks,&lt;ref name=latimes1990&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/175201121/|title=In Search of the Real Andrew Dice Clay|first=Patrick|last=Goldstein|date=3 June 1990|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|page=8–9, 84–86|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|subscription=yes|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-day-the-laughter-died-mw0000204358|title=The Day the Laughter Died|publisher=AllMusic|first=Tim|last=Griggs|accessdate=April 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; peaking at No. 39 on the ''Billboard'' 200.&lt;ref name=billboardchart/&gt;

In February 1990, Clay became the first comedian to sell out two consecutive nights at [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York City,&lt;ref name=desmoines1992/&gt; totalling 38,000 people in attendance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ew.com/article/1990/07/27/andrew-dice-clays-outrageous-comedy/|title=Andrew Dice Clay's outrageous comedy|work=Entertainment Weekly|first=Joyce Carol|last=Oates|date=27 July 1990|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 8, 1990, Clay appeared on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' which became the fourth highest-rated episode of the season.&lt;ref name=latimes1990/&gt; It was controversial as cast member [[Nora Dunn]], put off by his sexist humor, refused to appear in the episode. Two days later, musical guest [[Sinead O'Connor]] cancelled her scheduled appearance in protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-05-10/entertainment/ca-1917_1_andrew-dice-clay|title=O'Connor Won't Sing on 'SNL' in Protest Over Andrew Dice Clay|date=10 May 1990|work=The Los Angeles Times|accessdate=14 April 2018|first=Jane|last=Hall}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=leader1990&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/360984027|title=Nice 'Dice'?|first=Patrick|last=Goldstein|date=8 July 1990|newspaper=Leader-Telegram|page=39, 41|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|subscription=yes|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clay first met his agent Dennis Arfa at Dangerfield's, which led to his first HBO special, and ultimately his starring role in the 1990 film ''[[The Adventures of Ford Fairlane]]'';&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/15/arts/television-review-the-dice-is-back-and-so-is-the-act.html?src=pm TELEVISION REVIEW;The 'Dice' Is Back, And So Is the Act – New York Times].

In 1991, Clay ran his own production company, Fleebin Dabble Productions.&lt;ref name=journal1991/&gt; He is featured on the front cover of the April 1991 issue of ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]'', becoming the second male to front the magazine after [[George Burns]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/340421948/|title=Andrew Dice Clay now a cover boy|date=10 March 1991|newspaper=The Dispatch|page=35|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|subscription=yes|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Footage of Clay's shows at Madison Square Garden was used to produce his 1991 stand-up concert film ''[[Dice Rules]]''.

In 1993, ABC dropped a proposed one-hour television drama which was to feature Clay after management deemed him too controversial for the network. Clay had signed a one-year deal with ABC which kept him from working with other networks.&lt;ref name=lincoln1993&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/311981807/|title=Andrew Dice Clay takes hate list to TV|date=1 July 1993|newspaper=Lincoln Journal Star|page=9|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|subscription=yes|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1993, Clay released ''No Apologies'', the first stand-up concert pay-per-view special.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/561367/|title=No apologies|date=26 May 1993|newspaper=The Salina Journal|page=1|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|subscription=yes|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was purchased by over 250,000 homes to become the highest grossing non-sports pay-per-view event of the year.&lt;ref name=tampa1994&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/339931878/|title=Another roll of the 'Dice'|date=11 March 1994|newspaper=The Tamps Tribune|page=7|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|subscription=yes|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was to feature [[Joey Buttafuoco]] but the plan was dropped following the publicity it attracted and upon the advice of his attorney.&lt;ref name=lincoln1993/&gt; Clay followed it with a second pay television special, ''The Valentine's Day Massacre'', which aired in around 100,000 homes.&lt;ref name=tampa1994/&gt; In 1994, Clay accepted more television roles.&lt;ref name=tampa1994/&gt;

===Later career===
In 1995, Clay released an HBO special ''Assume the Position''. That same year, he signed a development deal with [[CBS]] and producer [[Bruce Helford]], resulting in his starring role on the sitcom ''[[Bless This House (U.S. TV series)|Bless This House]]''.&lt;ref name=chronicle1995&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/135994627/|title=Another role of the Dice: Andrew Clay in family sitcom|date=28 July 1995|newspaper=Democrat and Chronicle|page=2C|first=Steven Cole|last=Smith|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|subscription=yes|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-1995, Clay explained that the Diceman character had "sort of gone out of hand" which he felt happy about because it allowed him to pursue more television and film work than before. The situation led to a change in his stand-up act, focusing more on being a husband and a father yet still with an "edge".&lt;ref name=chronicle1995/&gt;

In 1998, Clay released the triple album ''[[Filth (Andrew Dice Clay album)|Filth]]'' through his website. Later in 1998, Clay began appearing on the New York City-based radio show ''[[Opie and Anthony]]''. Clay's opening act at the time, [[Jim Norton (comedian)|Jim Norton]], became the show's co-host in late 2000.

In 2000, Clay released ''I'm Over Here Now'' and ''Banned for Life''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0201680|title=Andrew Dice Clay: I'm Over Here Now (2000)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0250210|title=Andrew Dice Clay: Banned for Life (TV Movie 2000)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 2000, he released ''Face Down, Ass Up''.

He appeared as a part of [[NBC]]'s ''[[The Celebrity Apprentice 2]]'' and was the first celebrity to be fired, after he openly entertained the idea of quitting while in [[Donald Trump]]'s presence and calling Trump "Donny Trump".
