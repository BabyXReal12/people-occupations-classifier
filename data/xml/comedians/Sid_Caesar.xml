[[File:Its a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World Trailer4.jpg|thumb|270px|&lt;center&gt;L-R: [[Edie Adams]], Sid Caesar, [[Jonathan Winters]], [[Ethel Merman]], [[Milton Berle]], [[Mickey Rooney]] and [[Buddy Hackett]] in ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' (1963) ]]
'''Isaac Sidney''' "'''Sid'''" '''Caesar''' (September 8, 1922&amp;nbsp;– February 12, 2014) was an American comic actor and writer, best known for two pioneering 1950s live television series: ''[[Your Show of Shows]]'', which was a 90-minute weekly show watched by 60 million people, and its successor, ''[[Caesar's Hour]]'', both of which influenced later generations of comedians.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|78KZl_j8YiM|"Sid Caesar remembered as one of TV s early kings of comedy"}}, ''CBS This Morning'', Feb. 13, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; ''Your Show of Shows'' and its cast received seven [[Emmy]] nominations between the years 1953 and 1954 and tallied two wins. He also acted in movies; he played Coach Calhoun in ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' (1978) and its sequel ''[[Grease 2]]'' (1982) and appeared in the films ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' (1963), ''[[Silent Movie]]'' (1976), ''[[History of the World, Part I]]'' (1981), and ''[[Cannonball Run II]]'' (1984).

Caesar was considered a "sketch comic" and actor, as opposed to a stand-up comedian. He also relied more on body language, accents, and facial contortions than simply dialogue. Unlike the slapstick comedy which was standard on TV, his style was considered "avant garde" in the 1950s. He conjured up ideas and scene and used writers to flesh out the concept and create the dialogue. Among the writers who wrote for Caesar early in their careers were [[Mel Brooks]], [[Neil Simon]], [[Larry Gelbart]], [[Carl Reiner]], [[Michael Stewart (playwright)|Michael Stewart]], [[Mel Tolkin]], [[Selma Diamond]], and [[Woody Allen]]. "Sid's was the show to which all comedy writers aspired. It was the place to be," said [[Steve Allen]].

His TV shows' subjects included satires of real life events and people—and parodies of popular film genres, theater, television shows, and opera. But unlike other comedy shows at the time, the dialogue was considered sharper, funnier, and more adult-oriented. He was "...best known as one of the most intelligent and provocative innovators of television comedy," who some critics called ''television's Charlie Chaplin'' and ''[[The New York Times]]'' refers to as the "...comedian of comedians from TV's early days."&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

Honored in numerous ways over 60 years, he was nominated for 11 [[Emmy Awards]], winning twice. He was also a [[saxophonist]] and author of several books, including two autobiographies in which he described his career and later struggle to overcome years of alcoholism and addiction to barbiturates.

==Early life==
Caesar was the youngest of three sons born to [[Ashkenazi Jews|Jewish]] immigrants living in [[Yonkers, New York]]. His father was Max Ziser (1874–1946) and his mother was Ida (née Raphael) (1887–1975). They likely were from [[Dąbrowa Tarnowska]], Poland.&lt;ref&gt;cite web|url=http://jgsgw.org/SidCaeserArticle.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Reports state that the surname "Caesar" was given to Max, as a child, by an immigration official at [[Ellis Island]].&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Census 1920, Yonkers, NY, enumerator's district 205, page 15A, and U.S. Census 1930, Yonkers, NY, enumerator's district 60-3, p. 6A&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | work=St. James Encyclopedia of Pop Culture |title=Sid Caesar | first=Susan| last=Murray | editor1 = Tom Pendergast |editor2=Sara Pendergast | publisher= St.James Press | year=2013 | isbn= 978-1558628472}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/70/Sid-Caesar.html |title=Sid Caesar Biography (1922–) |publisher=Filmreference.com |accessdate=2013-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is an urban myth. According to Marian L. Smith, senior historian of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service, there is no known case of a name changed at Ellis Island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilw.com/articles/2005,0808-smith.shtm#bio|title=American Names: Declaring Independence

By waiting on tables, their son learned to mimic the [[patois]], rhythm and accents of the diverse clientele, a technique he termed ''[[double-talk]]'', which he used throughout his career. He first tried double-talk with a group of Italians, his head barely reaching above the table. They enjoyed it so much that they sent him over to a group of Poles to repeat his native-sounding patter in Polish, and so on with Russians, Hungarians, Frenchmen, Spaniards, Lithuanians, and Bulgarians. Sid Caesar's older brother, David, was his comic mentor and "one-man cheering section."&lt;ref name="WaPo"&gt;{{cite news |first=Patricia |last=Brennan |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/sid-caesar-dies-pathbreaking-comedian/2014/02/12/f2e37274-9423-11e3-b46a-5a3d0d2130da_story.html |title=Sid Caesar dies; pathbreaking comedian |work=The Washington Post |date=February 12, 2014 |accessdate=2014-02-13 |archivedate=February 16, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6NPwtIJkQ?url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/sid-caesar-dies-pathbreaking-comedian/2014/02/12/f2e37274-9423-11e3-b46a-5a3d0d2130da_story.html |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They created their earliest family sketches from movies of the day like ''[[Test Pilot (film)|Test Pilot]]'' and the 1927 silent film ''[[Wings (1927 film)|Wings]]''.&lt;ref name=Auto2&gt;{{cite book|title=Caesar's Hours: My Life in Comedy, with Love and Laughter|year=2004|author=Sid Caesar|author2=Eddy Friedfeld |isbn=9781586481520}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At 14, Caesar went to the [[Catskill Mountains]] as a saxophonist in the Swingtime Six band with Mike Cifichello and Andrew Galos and occasionally performed in sketches in the [[Borscht Belt]].&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

==Career==

===Stage and film===
After graduating from [[Yonkers High School]] in 1939,&lt;ref name=MuseumTV /&gt; Caesar left home, intent on a musical career. He arrived in [[Manhattan]] and worked as an usher and then a doorman at the [[Capitol Theatre (New York City)|Capitol Theater]] there.&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt; He was ineligible to join the musicians' union in New York City until he established residency,&lt;ref name=Auto2 /&gt; but he found work as a saxophonist at the Vacationland Hotel, a resort located in the [[Catskill Mountains]] of [[Sullivan County, New York]]. Mentored by Don Appel, the resort's social director, Caesar played in the dance band and learned to perform comedy, doing three shows a week.&lt;ref name=Auto2 /&gt; He [[Academic audit|audited]] classes in clarinet and saxophone at the [[Juilliard School of Music]].&lt;ref name=SPIobit&gt;{{cite news |last=Gennis |first=Sadie |url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Sid-Caesar-Dies-1077640.aspx |title=Comedian Sid Caesar Dies at 91 |work=[[TV Guide]] |accessdate=2014-02-13 |archivedate=February 16, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6NPxPzvRb?url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Sid-Caesar-Dies-1077640.aspx |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939, he enlisted in the [[United States Coast Guard]], and was stationed in [[Brooklyn]], New York, where he played in military revues and shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uscg.mil/history/faqs/sidcaesar.asp |title=Frequently Asked Questions: Sid Caesar |publisher=[[United States Coast Guard]] |accessdate=2013-12-26 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6NPxXrHo8?url=http://www.uscg.mil/history/faqs/sidcaesar.asp |archivedate=February 16, 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vernon Duke]], the composer of ''Autumn in New York'', ''April in Paris'', and ''Taking a Chance on Love'', was at the same base and collaborated with Caesar on musical revues.&lt;ref name=Auto2/&gt;

During the summer of 1942, Caesar met his future wife, Florence Levy, at the Avon Lodge in the Catskills village of [[Woodridge, New York]]. They were married on July 17, 1943,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5jr9L--C4tMC&amp;pg=PA64&amp;lpg=PA64&amp;dq=sid+caesar+married+July+17,+1943&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZR1TtYw7h8&amp;sig=nZSrQlYGG5_N9kgQhFr196k9zos&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2er8Up2FKZG7oQSk0oGQBQ&amp;ved=0CF8Q6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=sid%20caesar%20married%20July%2017%2C%201943&amp;f=false | title= The Great Clowns of American Television| first= Karin | last= Adir | publisher = [[McFarland &amp; Company]] | year = 2001 | page=64| isbn=978-0786413034}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had three children: Michele, Rick and Karen.&lt;ref name=MuseumTV /&gt; After joining the musicians' union, he briefly played with [[Shep Fields]], [[Claude Thornhill]], [[Charlie Spivak]], [[Art Mooney]] and [[Benny Goodman]].&lt;ref name=MuseumTV&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museum.tv/eotv/caesarsid.htm |quote=|accessdate=2014-02-12 |title=Sid Caesar |publisher=[[Museum of Broadcast Communications]] | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140216005056/http://www.museum.tv/eotv/caesarsid.htm | archivedate=February 16, 2014| deadurl = no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in his career, he performed [[Sing, Sing, Sing (With a Swing)|"Sing, Sing, Sing"]] with Goodman for a TV performance.&lt;ref&gt;video: {{YouTube|UkMl3-Rmjt8|Sid Caesar performing "Sing, Sing, Sing" with Benny Goodman and his orchestra}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Still in the service, Caesar was ordered to [[Palm Beach, Florida]], where Vernon Duke and [[Howard Dietz]] were putting together a service revue called ''Tars and Spars''. There he met the civilian director of the show, [[Max Liebman]]. When Caesar's comedy got bigger applause than the musical numbers, Liebman asked him to do stand-up bits between the songs. ''Tars and Spars'' toured nationally, and became Caesar's first major gig as a comedian.&lt;ref name="clips"/&gt; Liebman later produced Caesar's first television series.

After the war, the Caesars moved to Hollywood. In 1946, [[Columbia Pictures]] produced a film version of ''Tars and Spars'' in which Caesar reprised his role. The next year, he acted in ''[[The Guilt of Janet Ames]]''. He turned down the lead of ''[[The Jolson Story]]'' as he did not want to be known as an impersonator, and turned down several other offers to play sidekick roles.&lt;ref name="Auto2" /&gt;  He soon returned to New York, where he became the opening act for [[Joe E. Lewis]] at the [[Copacabana (nightclub)|Copacabana nightclub]].  He reunited with Liebman, who guided his stage material and presentation. That job led to a contract with the [[William Morris Agency]] and a nationwide tour. Caesar also performed in a Broadway revue, ''Make Mine Manhattan'', which featured ''The Five Dollar Date''—one of his first original pieces, in which he sang, acted, double-talked, pantomimed, and wrote the music.&lt;ref name="LATobit"/&gt; He won a 1948 [[Donaldson Awards|Donaldson Award]] for his contributions to the musical.&lt;ref name=Auto2/&gt;&lt;ref name=VarietyObit&gt;{{cite news|author=Richard Natale |url=https://variety.com/2014/tv/news/sid-caesar-master-of-tv-comedy-dies-at-91-1201100019/ |title=Sid Caesar Dead, Iconic Comedian Dies At 91 |publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=2014-02-12 |accessdate=2014-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television===
Caesar's television career began with an appearance on [[Milton Berle]]'s ''[[Texaco Star Theater]]''&lt;ref name="clips"&gt;Day, Patrick Kevin. [http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/showtracker/la-et-st-sid-caesar-five-tv-clips-that-demonstrate-his-comic-genius-20140212,0,4230797.story#ixzz2tAVc97C5 "Sid Caesar: Five TV clips that demonstrate his comic genius"] ''Los Angeles Times'', February 12, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; in the fall of 1948.&lt;ref name=brooksmarshp13&gt;{{cite book|last = Brooks|first = Tim|authorlink = Tim Brooks (television historian)|author2=Marsh, Earle |title = [[The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows 1946–Present]] Eighth Edition|publisher = [[Ballantine Books]]|year = 2003|page = 13|isbn = 0-345-45542-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1949, Caesar and Liebman met with [[Pat Weaver]], vice president of television at NBC, which led to Caesar's first series, ''[[Admiral Broadway Revue]]'' with [[Imogene Coca]]. The Friday show was simultaneously broadcast on [[National Broadcasting Corporation|NBC]] and the [[DuMont Television Network|DuMont]] network, and was an immediate success. However, its sponsor, [[Admiral (electrical appliances)|Admiral]], an appliance company, could not keep up with the demand for its new television sets, so the show was cancelled after 26 weeks—ironically, on account of its runaway success.&lt;ref name="LATobit"/&gt;
[[File:Coca caesar your show of shows 1952.JPG|thumb|[[Imogene Coca]] and Sid Caesar in ''[[Your Show of Shows]]'' (1952)]]
On February 25, 1950, Caesar appeared in the first episode of ''[[Your Show of Shows]]'', initially the second half of the two-hour umbrella show, ''Saturday Night Review''; at the end of the 1950–51 season, ''Your Show of Shows'' became its own, 90-minute program from the International Theatre at 5 Columbus Circle and later The Center Theatre at Sixth Avenue and 49th Street. &lt;ref name=brooksmarshp1344&gt;Brooks, Marsh, p. 1344.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Burgess Meredith]] hosted the first two shows,&lt;ref name=brooksmarshp1344 /&gt; and the premiere featured musical guests [[Gertrude Lawrence]], [[Lily Pons]] and [[Robert Merrill]].&lt;ref name=Auto2/&gt; The show was a mix of [[sketch comedy]], movie and television satires, Caesar's monologues, musical guests, and large production numbers. Guests included: [[Jackie Cooper]], [[Robert Preston (actor)|Robert Preston]], [[Rex Harrison]], [[Eddie Albert]], [[Michael Redgrave]], [[Basil Rathbone]], [[Charlton Heston]], [[Geraldine Page]], [[Douglas Fairbanks Jr.]], [[Pearl Bailey]], [[Fred Allen]], [[Benny Goodman]], [[Lena Horne]] and many other stars of the time. It was also responsible for bringing together the comedy team of Caesar, Coca, [[Carl Reiner]], and [[Howard Morris]]. Many writers also got their break creating the show's sketches, including Lucille Kallen, [[Mel Brooks]], [[Neil Simon]], [[Michael Stewart (playwright)|Michael Stewart]], [[Mel Tolkin]] and [[Sheldon Keller]]. Sid Caesar won his first [[Emmy]] in 1952. In 1951 and 1952, he was voted the United States' Best Comedian in ''[[Motion Picture Daily]]''{{'}}s TV poll. The show ended after almost 160 episodes&lt;ref name="Auto2"/&gt; on June 5, 1954.&lt;ref name=brooksmarshp1344 /&gt;

A few months later, Caesar returned with ''[[Caesar's Hour]]'', a one-hour sketch/variety show with Morris, Reiner, [[Bea Arthur]] and other members of his former crew. [[Nanette Fabray]] replaced Coca, who had left to star in her own short-lived series. Ultimate creative and technical control was now in Caesar's hands, originating from the [[Century Theatre (New York City)|Century Theater]]&lt;ref name="Auto2"/&gt; and the weekly budget doubled to $125,000.&lt;ref name="Auto2"/&gt; The premiere on September 27, 1954, featured [[Gina Lollobrigida]].&lt;ref name="Auto2"/&gt; Everything was performed live, including the commercials.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

''[[Caesar's Hour]]'' was followed by ABC's short-lived ''Sid Caesar Invites You'' from January 26 to May 25, 1958. It briefly reunited Caesar, Coca, and Reiner, with Simon and Brooks among the writers.&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, Marsh, pp. 1068–69.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963, Caesar appeared on television, on stage, and in the movies. Several ''As Caesar Sees It'' specials evolved into the 1963–64 ''Sid Caesar Show'' (which alternated with [[Edie Adams]] in ''Here's Edie''). He starred with [[Virginia Martin]] in the Broadway musical ''[[Little Me (musical)|Little Me]]'', with book by Simon, choreography by [[Bob Fosse]], and music by [[Cy Coleman]]. Playing eight parts with 32 costume changes, he was nominated in 1963 for a [[Tony Award]] for Best Leading Actor in a Musical.&lt;ref name=BWWorld&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.broadwayworld.com/tonyawardsyear.cfm?year=1963# |title=1963 Tony Award Winners |publisher=BroadwayWorld.com |accessdate=2014-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; On film, Caesar and Adams played a husband and wife drawn into a mad race to find buried loot in the 1963 comedy extravaganza ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]''.

===Style and technique===
Caesar was not a stand-up comedian but a "sketch comic, and actor," wrote one historian. "He conjured up ideas and enhanced scenes, but never wrote a word," and thereby depended on his writers for dialogue.&lt;ref name=Nachman&gt;{{cite book |last1= Nachman |first1=Gerald |author-link1= Gerald Nachman (journalist) |title=Seriously Funny |script-title=The Rebel Comedians of the 1950s and 1960s|url=http://geraldnachman.com/about.html |location=New York, NY |publisher=Pantheon Books |publication-date=2003 | pages= 99–122 |isbn=  9780375410307 &lt;!-- 0375410309 --&gt; |oclc=50339527  |trans-title= |author-mask1= |date= |year= |orig-year= |editor1-last= |editor1-first= |editor1-link= |editor1-mask= |display-editors= |type= |language= |edition= |page= |access-date= |quote= |postscript= |ref= }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Caesar was skilled at [[pantomime]], dialects, monologues, foreign language double-talk and general comic acting.&lt;ref name=Newcomb&gt;Newcomb, Horace, editor. ''Encyclopedia of Television'' volume 1, Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers (1997) pp. 272–274&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sid Caesar - 1972-1.jpg|thumb|left|Caesar in 1972]]
His sketches were often long, sometimes 10 or 15 minutes, with numerous close-ups showing the expressions on the faces of Caesar and other actors. Caesar relied more on body language, accents, and facial contortions than simply spoken dialogue. Unlike the slapstick comedy, which was standard on TV, his style was considered ''[[avant garde]]''.&lt;ref name=Nachman/&gt; Caesar "...was born with the ability to write physical poetry," notes comedian [[Steve Allen]],&lt;ref name=Nachman /&gt; a technique like that used for a silent film comedian.&lt;ref name=Nachman /&gt; An example of this "silent film" style is a live sketch with [[Nanette Fabray]], where they both pantomime with careful choreography, having an argument with music by Beethoven in the background.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|9QSvGnDd4m4|"Sid Caesar &amp; Nannette Fabry - Argument to Beethoven's 5th"}}, video clip&lt;/ref&gt;

Writer [[Mel Tolkin]] stated that Caesar "didn't like one-line jokes in sketches because he felt that if the joke was a good one, anybody could do it. One-liners would take him away from what drove his personal approach to comedy."&lt;ref name=Nachman/&gt; Larry Gelbart called Caesar's style theatrical, and called him "...a pure TV comedian."&lt;ref name=Nachman/&gt; In describing his control during the live performances, actress Nanette Fabray recalled that unlike most comedians, such as [[Red Skelton]], [[Bob Hope]] or [[Milton Berle]], Caesar always stayed in character: "He was so totally into the scene he never lost it."&lt;ref name=Nachman /&gt;

Caesar was able to pantomime a wide variety of things: a tire, a gumball machine, a lion, a dog, a punching bag, a telephone, an infant, an elevator, a railroad train, a herd of horses, a piano, a rattlesnake and a bottle of seltzer.&lt;ref name=Nachman/&gt; On the [[Dick Clark]] show in 1978, he played a chewing gum machine and a slot machine.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|zAfphVDJems|"Sid Caesar on Dick Clark's Life Wednesday show"}}, 1978&lt;/ref&gt; He was also able to create imaginary characters. [[Alfred Hitchcock]] compared him to [[Charlie Chaplin]], and critic John Crosby felt "he could wrench laughter out of you with the violence of his great eyes and the sheer immensity of his parody."&lt;ref name=Nachman/&gt; In an article in ''The Saturday Evening Post'' in 1953, show business biographer [[Maurice Zolotow]] noted that "Caesar relies upon grunts and grimaces to express a vast range of emotions."&lt;ref name=Nachman/&gt;

Of his double-talk routines, [[Carl Reiner]] said, "His ability to doubletalk every language known to man was impeccable,"&lt;ref name="Reuters"&gt;{{cite news |last=Dobuzinskis |first=Alex |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/12/us-sidcaesar-idUSBREA1B20H20140212 |title=Comic legend Sid Caesar dies at 91 |publisher=[[Reuters]] |accessdate=2014-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and during one performance Caesar imitated four different languages but with almost no real words.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|2SqEmkwADmY|"Sid Caesar performing in four different languages"}}, video clip&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his apparent fluency in many languages, Caesar could actually speak only English and [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]]. In 2008, Caesar told a ''[[USA Today]]'' reporter, "Every language has its own music ... If you listen to a language for 15 minutes, you know the rhythm and song."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Keveney |first=Bill |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/people/2008-01-08-sid-caesar_N.htm |title=Sid Caesar is the showman of showmen who keeps on laughing |publisher=[[USA Today]] |date=2008-01-09 |accessdate=2014-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having developed this mimicry skill, he could create entire monologues using gibberish in numerous languages, as he did in a skit in which he played a German general.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|5m6Czgl1acU|"Sid Caesar as "The German General"}}, video clip&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subjects===
Among his primary subjects were parodies and spoofs of various film genres, including gangster films, westerns, newspaper dramas, spy movies and other TV shows. Unlike other comedy shows at the time, the dialogue on his shows were considered sharper, funnier and more adult oriented.&lt;ref name=Nachman/&gt; In his sketches for ''Your Show of Shows'' and ''Caesar's Hour'', he would also typically "skewer the minutiae of domestic life" along with lampooning popular or classic movies.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/13/arts/television/sid-caesar-comic-who-blazed-tv-trail-dies-at-91.html | title = Sid Caesar, Comedian of Comedians From TV’s Early Days, Dies at 91| work = [[The New York Times]] | first= Mervyn | last= Rothstein | first2=Peter | last2=Keepnews | date= February 12, 2014 | accessdate= 2014-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary movies, foreign movies, theater, television shows and opera were targets of satire by the writing team. Often the publicity generated by the sketches boosted the box office of the original productions. Some notable sketches included: "From Here to Obscurity" (''[[From Here to Eternity]]''), "Aggravation Boulevard" (''[[Sunset Boulevard (film)|Sunset Boulevard]]''), "Hat Basterson" (''[[Bat Masterson (TV series)|Bat Masterson]]''), and "No West for the Wicked" (''[[Stagecoach (1939 film)|Stagecoach]]'').

They also performed some recurring sketches. "The Hickenloopers", television's first bickering-couple sketch, predated ''[[The Honeymooners]]''. As "The Professor", Caesar was the daffy expert who bluffed his way through his interviews with earnest roving reporter [[Carl Reiner]]. In its various incarnations, "The Professor" could be Gut von Fraidykat (mountain-climbing expert), Ludwig von Spacebrain (space expert), or Ludwig von Henpecked (marriage expert). Later, "The Professor" was inspiration for Mel Brooks' "The Two Thousand Year Old Man".{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} The most prominent recurring sketch on the show was "The Commuters", which featured Caesar, Reiner, and Morris involved with everyday working and suburban life situations. Years later, the sketch "Sneaking through the Sound Barrier", a parody of the British film ''[[The Sound Barrier]]'', ran continuously as part of a display on supersonic flight at the [[National Air and Space Museum]] in Washington, D.C.

===Working with writers===
[[File:Sidcaesarpic.jpg|thumb|Caesar in 1980]]
[[Steve Allen]] claimed, "Sid's was the show to which all comedy writers aspired. It was the place to be."&lt;ref name=Nachman/&gt; While Caesar did not write his dialogue, he made all final decisions. His writers, such as [[Mel Brooks]], felt they "had a great instrument in Caesar that we could all play, and we played it very well."&lt;ref name=Nachman/&gt; As for Caesar, Nachman describes him basically as an "inspired idea man who allowed the writers to take more risks" than other TV shows.&lt;ref name=Nachman/&gt; [[Woody Allen]] remembers that "...you wrote situations," instead of jokes, as in "This Is Your Story" with Carl Reiner, a parody of the popular TV show ''[[This is Your Life]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|N-gOQp1Iddc|"Sid Caesar in "This Is Your Story"}}, video clip&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Margolick |first=David |url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/culture/2014/02/sid-caesars-finest-sketch.html |title=Sid Caesar's Finest 'Your Show of Shows' Sketch |publisher=The New Yorker |accessdate=2014-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was said to be "Caesar's personal favorite" sketch.&lt;ref name=Nachman/&gt;

In many cases, sketch dialogue was not even written down, but simply indicated by describing a scene, as in, "Sid does man coming home from business mad."&lt;ref name=Nachman/&gt; Sometimes, said [[Larry Gelbart]], it was "organized chaos," and when watching the writers create from offstage, felt, "...it was a religious experience."&lt;ref name=Nachman/&gt; To Mel Brooks, "it was a zoo. Everyone pitched lines at Sid. Jokes would be changed fifty times."&lt;ref name=Nachman/&gt; Naturally there were some explosive episodes: "Mr. Caesar once dangled a terrified Mr. Brooks from an 18th-story window until colleagues restrained him. With one punch, he knocked out a horse that had thrown his wife off its back, a scene that Mr. Brooks replayed in his movie ''[[Blazing Saddles]]''."&lt;ref name=Nachman/&gt;

[[Neil Simon]] recalled that after writing out a sketch and giving it to Caesar, "Sid would make it ten times funnier than what we wrote. Sid acted everything out, so the sketches we did were like little plays."&lt;ref name=Nachman/&gt; Simon also remembered the impact that working for Caesar had on him: "The first time I saw Caesar it was like seeing a new country. All other comics were basically doing situations with farcical characters. Caesar was doing life."&lt;ref name=Nachman/&gt;

Some of his writers, like [[Woody Allen]], initially didn't like being among the large team of writers coming up with routines for Caesar, feeling it was too competitive and contributed to hostility among writers. An Allen biographer wrote that Allen "...chafed under the atmosphere of inspired spontaneity", although Allen did say that, "Writing for Caesar was the highest thing you could aspire to—at least as a TV comedy writer. Only the presidency was above that."&lt;ref name=Nachman/&gt; [[Neil Simon]] noted that "we were competitive the way a family is competitive to get dad's attention. We all wanted to be Sid's favorite."&lt;ref name=Nachman/&gt; As part of the competitive atmosphere in ''The Writer's Room'', as it was called, friendship was also critical. [[Larry Gelbart]] explained:

{{quote|We were able to be urbane. Between us we read every book. Between us we saw every movie. Between us we saw every play on Broadway. You could make jokes about Kafka or Tennessee Williams. We also had dinner together. We went to movies together. We were all friends. And that was very important. We appreciated each other a lot.&lt;ref name=Maslon&gt;Maslon, Laurence. ''Make'em Laugh'', Hachette Book Group (2008) pp. 75–79&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Impact on television===
Nachman concludes that "the Caesar shows were the crème de la crème of fifties television," as they were "studded with satire, and their sketches sharper, edgier, more sophisticated than the other variety shows."&lt;ref name=Nachman/&gt; Likewise, historian Susan Murray notes that Caesar was "...best known as one of the most intelligent and provocative innovators of television comedy."&lt;ref name=Murray&gt;Murray, pp. 408–409&lt;/ref&gt;

According to actress [[Nanette Fabray]], who acted alongside Caesar, "He was the first original TV comedy creation."&lt;ref name=Nachman/&gt; His early shows were the "...gold standard for TV sketch comedy."&lt;ref name=Nachman/&gt; In 1951, ''[[Newsweek]]'' noted that according to "the opinion of lots of smart people, Caesar is the best that TV has to offer,"&lt;ref name=Nachman/&gt; while Zolotow, in his 1953 profile for ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'', wrote that "in temperament, physique, and technique of operation, Caesar represents a new species of comedian."&lt;ref name=Nachman/&gt;

However, his positive impact on television became a negative one for Broadway. Caesar fans preferred to stay home on Saturday nights to watch his show instead of seeing live plays. "The Caesar show became such a Saturday-night must-see habit—the ''Saturday Night Live'' of its day," states Nachman, that "...Broadway producers begged NBC to switch the show to midweek."&lt;ref name=Nachman/&gt; Comedy star [[Carol Burnett]], who later had her own hit TV show, remembers winning tickets to see ''My Fair Lady'' on Broadway: "I gave the tickets to my roommate because I said, ''Fair Lady's'' gonna be running for a hundred years, but Sid Caesar is live and I'll never see ''that'' again."&lt;ref name=Maslon/&gt;

===Faded success and personal problems===
After nearly 10 years as a prime-time star of television comedy with ''Your Show of Shows'' followed by ''Caesar's Hour'', his stardom ended rapidly and he nearly disappeared from the spotlight. Nachman describes this period:

{{quote|Caesar slid into a personal and career abyss ... [he] had no interest in movies ... He would live and die by the tube. His career was short-circuited by alcohol and pills ... The pressures of sudden stardom, of headlining and co-producing a weekly hit show, crushed him.&lt;ref name=Nachman/&gt;}}

Caesar himself felt, "It had all come too fast, was too easy, and he didn't deserve the acclaim."&lt;ref name=Nachman/&gt; Writer [[Mel Brooks]], who also became his close friend, said, "I know of no other comedian, including Chaplin, who could have done nearly ten years of live television. Nobody's talent was ever more used up than Sid's. He was one of the greatest artists ever born. But over a period of years, television ground him into sausages."&lt;ref name=Nachman/&gt;

In 1977, after blacking out during a stage performance of [[Neil Simon]]'s ''[[The Last of the Red Hot Lovers]]'' in [[Regina, Saskatchewan]], Caesar gave up alcohol "[[cold turkey]]". In his 1982 autobiography, ''[[Where Have I Been?]]'', and his second book, ''Caesar's Hours'', he chronicled his struggle to overcome his alcoholism and addiction to [[Barbiturate|sleeping pills]].

===Later years===

Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Caesar continued to make occasional television and theatrical appearances and starred in several movies including ''[[Silent Movie]]'' and ''[[History of the World, Part I]]'' (both reuniting him with Mel Brooks), ''[[Airport 1975]]'', and as Coach Calhoun in ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' and its sequel ''[[Grease 2]]'' in 1982. In 1971, he starred opposite [[Carol Channing]] and a young [[Tommy Lee Jones]] in the Broadway show ''[[Four on a Garden]]''.

In 1973, Caesar reunited with [[Imogene Coca]] for the stage play, ''[[The Prisoner of Second Avenue]]'', written  in 1971 by [[Neil Simon]]. Their play opened in Chicago in August 1973.&lt;ref&gt;''Chicago Daily News'', July 23, 1973&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, Caesar and Max Liebman mined their own personal [[kinescopes]] from ''[[Your Show of Shows]]'' (NBC had "lost" the studio copies) and they produced a feature film ''Ten From Your Show of Shows'', a compilation of some of their best sketches. In 1974, Caesar said, "I'd like to be back every week" on TV and appeared in the NBC skit-based comedy [[television pilot]] called ''Hamburgers''.&lt;ref&gt;"Sid Caesar, Once Shining TV Star Makes Rare Appearance Tonight," ''Nashua Telegraph'', 2 April 1974, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, he appeared as a double talking Japanese father for Mei and Kei's Pink Lady and opposite Jeff Altman in the Pink Lady and Jeff show.

In 1983, Caesar hosted an episode of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', where he received a standing ovation at the start of the show and was awarded a plaque at the conclusion of the show declaring him an honorary cast member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://snltranscripts.jt.org/82/82l.phtml | title = Air Date: February 5th, 1983 — Host: Sid Caesar | publisher= ''SNL'' Transcripts | accessdate= 2014-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He released an exercise video, ''Sid Caesar's Shape Up!'', in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;Vettel, Phil.

[http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1985-08-09/entertainment/8502210879_1_exercise-tape-camera-hotel-room]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987–89, Caesar appeared as Frosch the Jailer in ''[[Die Fledermaus]]'' at the [[Metropolitan Opera]] in New York.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.metoperafamily.org/archives/scripts/cgiip.exe/WService=BibSpeed/gisrch2k.r?Term=Caesar,%20Sid%20%5BActor%5D&amp;limit=500&amp;vsrchtype=no&amp;xBranch=ALL&amp;xmtype=&amp;Start=&amp;End=&amp;theterm=Ca%65sa%72,%20Sid%20%5BAc%74o%72%5D&amp;srt=&amp;x=0&amp;xHome=&amp;xHomePath= Metropolitan Opera Archives]. Accessed May 15, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, Caesar starred in the David Irving film ''The Emperor's New Clothes'' with [[Robert Morse]] as the Tailor. Caesar remained active by appearing in movies, television and award shows, including the movie ''[[The Great Mom Swap]]'' in 1995.

In 1996, the [[Writers Guild of America, West]] reunited Caesar with nine of his writers from ''[[Your Show of Shows]]'' and ''[[Caesar's Hour]]'' for a two-hour panel discussion featuring head writer [[Mel Tolkin]], Caesar, [[Carl Reiner]], [[Aaron Ruben]], [[Larry Gelbart]], [[Mel Brooks]], [[Neil Simon]], [[Danny Simon]], [[Sheldon Keller]], and Gary Belkin. The event was taped, broadcast on PBS in the United States and the BBC in the UK, and later released as a DVD titled ''Caesar's Writers''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caesarswriters.com/about/ |title=Caesar's Writers &amp;#124; About |publisher=Caesarswriters.com |date=1996-01-24 |accessdate=2013-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sid Caesar-Steve Allen.jpg|240px|thumb|Caesar as guest on ''The Big Show'' with host [[Steve Allen]] in 1980]]
In 1997, he made a guest appearance in ''[[Vegas Vacation]]'' and, the following year, in ''[[The Wonderful Ice Cream Suit]]'' in 1998 based on a [[Ray Bradbury]] novel. Also that year, Caesar joined fellow television icons [[Bob Hope]] and [[Milton Berle]] at the 50th anniversary of the [[Primetime Emmy Awards]]. [[Billy Crystal]] also paid tribute to Caesar that night when he won an Emmy for hosting that year's Oscar telecast, recalling seeing Caesar doing a parody of [[Yul Brynner]] in ''[[The King &amp; I]]'' on ''Your Show of Shows''. Caesar performed his double-talk in a "foreign dub" skit on the November 21, 2001 episode of ''[[Whose Line Is It Anyway? (U.S. TV series)|Whose Line Is It Anyway?]]''

On September 7, 2001, Caesar, Carl Reiner and Nanette Fabray appeared on [[CNN]]'s live interview program ''[[Larry King Live]]'' along with actor, comedian and [[Improvisational theatre|improvisationist]] [[Drew Carey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0109/07/lkl.00.html |title=''Larry King Live'' Transcript: "Hail Sid Caesar" |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=2001-09-07 |accessdate=2014-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, he joined [[Edie Adams]] and [[Marvin Kaplan]] at a 40th anniversary celebration for ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.in70mm.com/news/2003/mad_world/index.htm |title="It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World" 40th anniversary |publisher=In70mm.com |date=2003-10-19 |accessdate=2013-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Caesar's second autobiography, ''Caesar's Hours'', was published, and in 2006, [[Billy Crystal]] presented Caesar with the [[TV Land Awards]]' Pioneer Award.&lt;ref name=pioneeraward&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.tvland.com/sitemap/video/awards.jhtml| title= TV Land Awards | publisher= [[TV Land]] | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070911165202/http://www.tvland.com/sitemap/video/awards.jhtml | archivedate= September 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In what [[TV Land]] called "...a hilarious, heartfelt, multilingual, uncut acceptance speech,"&lt;ref name=pioneeraward /&gt; Caesar performed his double-talk for over five minutes.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

In a November 2009 article in the [[Toluca Lake, Los Angeles|Toluca Lake]], [[California]], ''[[Tolucan Times]]'', [[columnist]] Greg Crosby described a visit with Caesar and his wife Florence at their home. Of the couple's meeting, Florence said, "Well, I thought he was nice for the summer ... I thought he would be just a nice boyfriend for the summer. He was cute-looking and tall, over six feet.... I was in my last year at Hunter College; we were still dating when Sid went into the service, the Coast Guard. Luckily he was stationed in New York so we were able to continue seeing each other, even though my parents weren't too happy about it. They never thought he would amount to anything, that he'd never have a real career or make any money. But we were married one year after we met, in July of 1943." She also pointed out, "You know, he's not funny all the time. He can be very serious." At the time of the interview, the couple had been married for 66 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://tolucantimes.info/section/inside-this-issue/florence-caesar/ |title=Florence Caesar |publisher=''[[Tolucan Times|The Tolucan Times]]'' |date=2009-11-11 |accessdate=2014-02-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222212436/http://tolucantimes.info/section/inside-this-issue/florence-caesar/ |archivedate=2014-02-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Florence Caesar died on March 3, 2010, aged 88.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tributes.com/show/Florence-L.-Caesar-88156927 |title=Florence Caesar Obituary - Beverly Hills, California |publisher=Tributes.com |accessdate=2014-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Caesar died on February 12, 2014 at his home in Beverly Hills, California, at the age of 91, after a short illness.&lt;ref name="LATobit"&gt;{{cite news |last=McLellan |first=Dennis |url=http://www.latimes.com/obituaries/la-et-st-sid-caesar-pioneer-of-live-television-comedy-dies-at-91-20140212,0,5712035.story#axzz2t8zjLAHB |title=Sid Caesar, pioneer of live television comedy, dies at 91 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date= February 12, 2014 |accessdate=2014-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Caesar's death, [[Carl Reiner]] said, "He was the ultimate, he was the very best sketch artist and comedian that ever existed." [[Mel Brooks]] commented, "Sid Caesar was a giant, maybe the best comedian who ever practiced the trade. And I was privileged to be one of his writers and one of his friends."&lt;ref name="Reuters"/&gt; [[Jon Stewart]] and ''[[The Daily Show]]'' paid tribute to Caesar at the show's close on February 12, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/wed-february-12-2014/moment-of-zen---sid-caesar-tribute |title=Sid Caesar Tribute - The Daily Show with Jon Stewart - 02/12/14 (Video Clip) |publisher=TheDailyShow.com |date=2014-02-12 |accessdate=2014-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' republished a brief tribute written by Billy Crystal in August 2005, in which he said of Caesar and his contemporaries:

{{quote|I get nervous when I am with these giants. I always feel like I want to say, Thank you. I am blessed to have grown up in their time of perfection, to have witnessed the utter force of Sid. Live, uncut, daring but not risqué. Never stooping beneath themselves, Sid and this team of icons put forth a raucous, hilarious, and truthful brand of comedy that, 50 years later, is still funny and inspiring, and makes me think ... What kind of comedy would I be doing if I hadn't seen Sid Caesar? Would I be a comedian at all?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Crystal |first=Billy |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/vf-hollywood/sid-caesar-billy-crystal |title=All Hail Caesar |work=Vanity Fair |date=August 2005 |accessdate=2014-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He was predeceased by his wife, Florence (2010) and survived by his children Karen, Michelle, and Rick, and two grandsons. His interment was at [[Mount Sinai Memorial Park Cemetery]]. He had 3 children:  Karen, Michelle and Dr Richard (Rick) Caesar (died 2014).&lt;ref&gt;Friend&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- I don't think this is really Caesar's "official" site (esp. since they misspelled his last name on the index page!) It appears to be a merchandising site by Creative Light Entertainment, probably under license but not really what most folks will expect it to be.
