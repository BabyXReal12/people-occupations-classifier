'''Robert "Rob" Newman''' (born 7 July 1964) is a British comedian, author and [[political activist]]. Newman first found fame with [[The Mary Whitehouse Experience]] before forming a successful comedy partnership with [[David Baddiel]] in the early 1990s.

In 1993, Newman and his then comedy partner [[David Baddiel]] became the first comedians to play and sell out the 12,000-seat [[Wembley Arena]] in London. Newman's first speaking appearance was with Third World First (now known as [[People and Planet]]), the student political organisation.

== Early life and education==

Newman was adopted into a working-class family who lived in a [[Hertfordshire]] village. His adoptive father died when he was nine. Newman attended a comprehensive school, received poor A-level grades and was not offered a place at university until two years later, when he was admitted to [[Selwyn College, Cambridge]] to read English on the strength of an essay about [[T. S. Eliot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Filthy, rich, going to pieces: Much to the surprise of their detractors, Robert Newman and David Baddiel have become the hottest property in British comedy. Unfortunately, they seem to have fallen out in the process|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/filthy-rich-going-to-pieces-much-to-the-surprise-of-their-detractors-robert-newman-and-david-baddiel-1465474.html|newspaper=The Independent|date=5 December 1993| first=Giles|last=Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=My Secret Life: Rob Newman, comedian &amp; writer|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/my-secret-life-rob-newman-comedian-amp-writer-766090.html|newspaper=The Independent|date=29 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newman claims to have worked as a farmhand, warehouse-man, house painter, teacher, mail sorter, [[social worker]], and mover.&lt;ref name="Official website - biography"/&gt;

==Comedy career==
Newman began his comedy career as an [[impressionist (entertainment)|impressionist]] in the late 1980s before gaining fame when he appeared alongside fellow Cambridge alumni [[David Baddiel]], [[Hugh Dennis]] and [[Steve Punt]] in the [[BBC]] radio and TV programme ''[[The Mary Whitehouse Experience]]'' (1989–92).&lt;ref name="My Secret Life"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rob Newman: My Secret Life |date=29 December 2007 |accessdate=2008-11-19 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/my-secret-life-rob-newman-comedian-amp-writer-766090.html |work=[[The Independent]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5cSIgS2BF?url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/my-secret-life-rob-newman-comedian-amp-writer-766090.html |archivedate=19 November 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The title referred to the main campaigner for "moral decency" on television, [[Mary Whitehouse]]. With ''The Mary Whitehouse Experience'' Newman and Baddiel had become "unlikely pin-ups as, in the early 1990s, comedy was being fêted as 'the new [[rock 'n' roll|rock and roll]]'," leading to their own series, ''[[Newman and Baddiel in Pieces]]'' (1993).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/newmanandbaddiel/ |title=Comedy Guide: ''Newman and Baddiel in Pieces'' |accessdate=2008-11-19 |publisher=[[BBC]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5cSJJtfi3?url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/newmanandbaddiel/ |archivedate=19 November 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The partnership with Baddiel was widely reported as being fraught with tension. Unlike most double acts, their shows (both on TV and stage) were characterised by the two alternately delivering monologues, rarely appearing together except in sketches (most famously, ''[[The Mary Whitehouse Experience#History Today|History Today]]''). During the "Live and in Pieces" tour, relations deteriorated further and the [[Wembley Arena|Wembley]] show was widely and accurately predicted to be their last appearance together.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

After the break-up, the two men took wildly differing career paths. While Baddiel became part of the [[lad culture|"new lad"]] phenomenon of the mid-1990s, fronting shows like [[Fantasy Football League]], Newman largely disappeared from public life, reappearing with solo work marked by a clear social conscience and [[anti-establishment]] views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Graham |last=Hughes |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/liverpool/content/articles/2005/11/23/theatre_robnewman_feature.shtml |title=Review: Mark Thomas and Rob Newman Live |date=23 November 2005 |accessdate=2008-11-19 |publisher=[[BBC]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5cSJQDUro?url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/liverpool/content/articles/2005/11/23/theatre_robnewman_feature.shtml |archivedate=19 November 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He covered the [[WTO Ministerial Conference of 1999 protest activity|anti-globalisation Seattle protests]] of 1999 for the UKs [[Channel 4 News]].&lt;ref name="My Secret Life"/&gt; He has been politically active with [[Reclaim the Streets]], the [[Liverpool Dockers]], [[Indymedia]] and [[People's Global Action]].&lt;ref name="Official website - biography"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.robnewman.com/biog.html |title=Biography |accessdate=2008-11-19 |work=Robert Newman official website |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5cSJXv6UA?url=http://www.robnewman.com/biog.html |archivedate=19 November 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commondreams.org/views04/0308-11.htm |first=Suzanne |last=Charlé |title=Write On |accessdate=2008-11-19 |work=[[The American Prospect]] |date=8 March 2004 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5cSJfvNOz?url=http://www.commondreams.org/views04/0308-11.htm |archivedate=19 November 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metro.co.uk/metrolife/article.html?in_article_id=16931&amp;in_page_id=9 |first=Sharon |last=Lougher |title=Robert Newman |date=6 July 2006 |accessdate=2008-11-19 |work=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5cSJpHiNo?url=http://www.metro.co.uk/metrolife/article.html?in_article_id=16931&amp;in_page_id=9 |archivedate=19 November 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His later work is characterised by a very strong political element and parallels the work of contemporaries such as [[Mark Thomas]].&lt;ref name="Jeffries"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2005/aug/03/theatre.britishidentity |first=Stuart |last=Jeffries |title=No laughing matter |date=3 August 2005 |accessdate=2008-11-19 |work=[[The Guardian]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5cSJutcNa?url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2005/aug/03/theatre.britishidentity |archivedate=19 November 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, with actress [[Emma Thompson]], he called for a [[Nestlé boycott|boycott]] of the [[Perrier Comedy Award]], because [[Perrier]] is owned by [[Nestlé]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Scott |first=Kirsty |title=Spoof horror writer wins £5,000 Perrier award: Fringe comedy contest soured by baby milk protests |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=August 27, 2001 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/edinburghfestival2001/story/0,,543033,00.html |accessdate=June 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; an alternative competition called the Tap Water Awards was set up the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Tap Water Awards |url=http://www.TapWaterAwards.org/ |accessdate=June 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2003 Newman toured with ''From [[Caliban (character)|Caliban]] to the [[Taliban]]'', which was released on CD and DVD. In 2005 the show ''[[Apocalypso Now]] or, from [[P45 (tax)|P45]] to [[AK47]], [[permanent war economy|how to Grow the Economy with the Use of War]]'' debuted at the [[Bongo Club]] during the 2005 [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/edinburgh/reviews/review.php/9374/robert-newman-apocalypso-now |title=Reviews: Robert Newman: ''Apocalypso Now'' |first=Nick |last=Awle |accessdate=2008-11-19 |work=[[The Stage]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5cSPwRzPE?url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/edinburgh/reviews/review.php/9374/robert-newman-apocalypso-now |archivedate=19 November 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Apocalypso Now'' toured nationally, sometimes as part of a double-bill where Newman was joined by Mark Thomas. The show was filmed at the [[Hoxton Hall]] in [[Hoxton]], east London and shown on [[More4]] under the title ''A History of Oil'', with a later release on CD and DVD. A mixture of stand-up comedy and introductory lecture on [[geopolitics]] and [[peak oil]], in ''Apocalypso Now'' Newman argues that twentieth-century Western foreign policy, including [[World War I]], should be seen as a continuous struggle by the West to control Middle Eastern oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spinwatch.org.uk/reviews-mainmenu-24/video-reviews-mainmenu-25/3298-history-of-oil--rob-newman |first=Michael |last=Greenwell |title=''History of Oil'' – Rob Newman |date= |accessdate=2008-11-19 |work=SpinWatch |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5cSK2dCsH?url=http://www.spinwatch.org.uk/reviews-mainmenu-24/video-reviews-mainmenu-25/3298-history-of-oil--rob-newman |archivedate=19 November 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jeffries"/&gt; Newman draws from [[Richard Heinberg]]'s book ''[[The Party's Over: Oil, War, and the Fate of Industrial Societies]]'' as source material for portions of the show dealing with peak oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/podcasts/2006/03/interview_with_robert_newman.html |first=Paul |last=Hamilos |title=There's No Planet B: Interview: Robert Newman |date=31 March 2006 |accessdate=2008-11-19 |work=The Guardian |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5cSK9zezQ?url=http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/podcasts/2006/03/interview_with_robert_newman.html |archivedate=19 November 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 Newman performed a new show, ''No Planet B or, The History of the World Backwards'', at the [[Tricycle Theatre]] in [[Kilburn, London|Kilburn]], north-west London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2006/07/05/btplanetb05.xml |first=Charles |last=Spencer |title=History boy needs more jokes |date=7 May 2006 |accessdate=2008-11-19 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5cSKRxQMr?url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=%2Farts%2F2006%2F07%2F05%2Fbtplanetb05.xml |archivedate=19 November 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the BBC commissioned a six-part series, ''[[The History of the World Backwards]]'' based on ''No Planet B'', for transmission on [[BBC Four]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0088kmv |title=BBC Four Programmes: ''The History of the World Backwards'' |date=10 December 2007 |accessdate=2008-11-19 |work=[[BBC]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5cSL2YRKR?url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0088kmv |archivedate=19 November 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.robnewman.com/abouthistory.html |title=Robert Newman's ''The History of the World Backwards'' |accessdate=2008-11-19 |work=Robert Newman official website |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5cSL6dozl?url=http://www.robnewman.com/abouthistory.html |archivedate=19 November 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The script of the stage version show is accessible on Newman's official website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.robnewman.com/history.html |title=No Planet B – The History of the World Backwards |date=July 2006 |accessdate=2008-11-19 |work=Robert Newman official website |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5cSL9LqM8?url=http://www.robnewman.com/history.html |archivedate=19 November 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, his BBC Radio 4 programme ''Robert Newman's Entirely Accurate Encyclopaedia of Evolution'' attempted to challenge some of the concepts of [[Richard Dawkins]]'s book ''[[The Selfish Gene]]''. It won the ''Best Scripted Comedy with a Live Audience'' award at the 2017 [[BBC Audio Drama Awards]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/5Ynb3jN3yHTz7BwDJVpbXyr/the-list-of-2017-winners |title= BBC Audio Drama Awards 2017 |accessdate= 2017-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing==
Newman co-wrote ''The Mary Whitehouse Experience Encyclopedia'' (1991), with [[David Baddiel]], [[Hugh Dennis]], and [[Steve Punt]].

He has written four novels: ''Dependence Day'' (1994); ''Manners'' (1998); ''The Fountain at the Centre of the World'' (2003); and ''The Trade Secret'' (2013).

In 2015 his book ''The Entirely Accurate Encyclopaedia of Evolution'', based on his stand-up show "Robert Newman's New Theory of Evolution", was published by [[Freight Books]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title = The Entirely Accurate Encyclopaedia of Evolution by Robert Newman - Freight Books |url = http://www.freightbooks.co.uk/product/the-entirely-accurate-encyclopaedia-of-evolution/|website = www.freightbooks.co.uk |access-date = 2016-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017 his book ''Neuropolis'' is published by [[Harper Collins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title = Neuropolis by Robert Newman - Harper Collins|url = https://www.harpercollins.co.uk/9780008228651/neuropolis |website = www.harpercollins.co.uk |access-date = 2017-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Fountain at the Centre of the World''===
[[Dwight Garner (critic)|Dwight Garner]], an editor of ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'', reviewed ''The Fountain at the Centre of the World'' favourably, saying "I wouldn't be surprised, in fact, if [it] became the talismanic ''[[Catch-22]]'' of the [[anti-globalisation]] protest movement, the fictional complement to [[Naomi Klein]]'s influential [[investigative journalism|exposé]] ''[[No Logo|No Logo: Taking Aim at the Brand Bullies]]''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E05E4D61039F932A35751C0A9629C8B63 |first=Dwight |last=Garner |title=The Battle of Seattle |date=1 February 2004 |accessdate=2008-11-19 |work=The New York Times |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5cSLGrsmO?url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E05E4D61039F932A35751C0A9629C8B63 |archivedate=19 November 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
