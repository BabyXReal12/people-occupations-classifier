'''Gregory C. Giraldo''' (December 10, 1965 &amp;ndash; September 29, 2010) was an [[United States|American]] [[stand-up comedian]], [[television personality]], and [[lawyer]]. He is remembered for his appearances on [[Comedy Central]]'s televised [[Comedy Central Roast|roast specials]], and for his work on that network's television shows ''[[Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn]]'', ''[[Lewis Black's Root of All Evil]]'', and the [[programming block]] ''[[Stand-Up Nation with Greg Giraldo|Stand-Up Nation]]'', the last of which he hosted.

==Early life==
Giraldo was born in [[The Bronx]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Steinberg |first=Dan |agency=Associated Press |date=October 1, 2010 |title=Saying goodbye to comedian Greg Giraldo |url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:cVJq7662h3MJ:www.examiner.com/article/saying-goodbye-to-comedian-greg-giraldo+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us |newspaper=Los Andeles Examiner |location=Los Angeles, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; and raised in [[Bayside, Queens]].&lt;ref name="wrapobit"&gt;TheWrap.com staff.

September 29, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  His father, Alfonso, was from [[Colombia]] and worked for [[Pan Am]], and his mother, Dolores, was from [[Spain]].  Giraldo was raised [[Roman Catholic]]&lt;ref name=punchlineinterview /&gt; and spoke fluent Spanish. He was the oldest of three children (brother John and sister Elizabeth). Giraldo played the [[guitar]] in a band in his late teens/early twenties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Greg Giraldo for 1-800-OK-Cable (Spanish 1)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mngAGIODxRQ|publisher=OK Cable}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RIP Greg Giraldo|last=Killian|first=Chris|date=September 29, 2010|url=http://www.ckcomedy.com/website/?p=374|accessdate=December 7, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130721170610/http://www.ckcomedy.com/website/?p=374|archivedate=July 21, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Giraldo was an excellent student and was accepted into the prestigious [[Regis High School (New York City)|Regis High School]] in Manhattan.  After graduating from Regis in 1983,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Regis Alumni News (Fall 2010, Page 47)|year=2010|url=http://community.regis-nyc.org/NetCommunity/Document.Doc?id=57|publisher=Regis Alumni News|accessdate=December 7, 2012}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; he went on to earn a bachelor's degree in English from [[Columbia University]]  in 1987&lt;ref name="columbia_alumnus"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.college.columbia.edu/cct/mar_apr11/obituaries_0 | title=Obituaries | publisher=Columbia College Today | date=Mar–Apr 2011 | accessdate=October 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a law degree from [[Harvard Law School]] in 1990.&lt;ref name="harvard_alumnus"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thecrimson.harvard.edu/article/2010/10/2/new-giraldo-brunswick-late/ | title=Greg Giraldo, Comedian and Former Harvard Law Alumnus, Dies | publisher=The Harvard Crimson | date=October 2, 2010 | accessdate=October 4, 2011 | author=Altman, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While at Columbia, he was an active member of the ''[[Psi Upsilon]]'' Fraternity. Giraldo was admitted to Harvard Law School after he achieved a near perfect score on his [[Law School Admission Test]] (LSAT), scoring in the 99th [[percentile]] of students taking the test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gosseling|first=Tim|date=March 6, 2005|title=Common Law' star to bring comedy to SU community|url=http://www.dailyorange.com/2.8691/common-law-star-to-bring-comedy-to-su-community-1.1242271|publisher=The Daily Orange|accessdate=August 19, 2012}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before becoming a comedian, Giraldo worked as a lawyer, spending eight months as an associate for [[Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom]] before changing his occupation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/attorney/AttorneyDetails?attorneyId=5472788  "New York State Bar Directory"]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the cases that Giraldo handled (on a [[pro bono]] basis) was an inciting-a-riot charge that was brought against his friend and fellow comedian [[Jeffrey Ross]] in 1993. Ross was performing at a comedy club on [[Long Island]] when a member of the audience produced a toy gun that looked very similar to a real gun. Ross grabbed the gun and started fighting with the audience member and ended up getting arrested.

Said Ross of the incident: "I had to go to court and Greg volunteered to be my attorney as a favor. I remember we slept in his parents' basement in Queens. We drove to court in a Jeep and had dirty blue sport jackets on. It took him two tries, but he got the case dismissed."

Giraldo stated that at the time of the case he had never done anything in a courtroom before, and he almost ended up sending Ross to jail when the case was upgraded to a weapons charge because he had nearly told Ross to plead guilty. "The judge called us over... and I had to plead, 'I have no idea what I'm doing here.' We ended up having to get a real lawyer and come back a month later," said Giraldo.&lt;ref&gt;The Opie and Anthony Show, September 20, 2007, Sirius XM Satellite Radio&lt;/ref&gt;

He said the LSAT and law school went well, but the actual work as a lawyer was not an option.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|url=http://www.cc.com/full-episodes/sgpgjt/stand-up-library-give-it-up-for-greg-giraldo-season-1-ep-101|title=''Stand-Up Library'': Give It Up for Greg Giraldo|publisher=[[Comedy Central]]|time=10:37–10:59|date=March 18, 2011|accessdate=December 3, 2016|quote=It was a ridiculous thought that I could possibly ever work at a regular job.&amp;nbsp;... I'd taken the LSATs and all that and that went well, and going to law school was fun enough, I guess, but then trying to be a real working lawyer was not an issue, not an [option]. I'm sitting here about to perform in front of a giant audience with my pants [duct]-taped together; so imagine the kind of lawyer I would be.}}&lt;/ref&gt; His family was disappointed when Giraldo got out of law practice, "but I always wanted to do something creative. I've always had real trouble knowing what my actual desires and goals are. I've just been dragged along by fate. I can't even tell you why I thought to go to law school."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dixit|first=Jay|date=May 13, 2009|title=Greg Giraldo On Failure|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/brainstorm/200905/greg-giraldo-failure|publisher=Psychology Today|accessdate=December 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also stated: "Because I went to Harvard Law School it seemed like I had my shit together, but I did only because it’s not hard. Everyone is so self-motivated that they leave you alone. You get study outlines and just cram, but then when you get out into the real world, it gets tricky. Most comedians are people who couldn’t really work in the real world, they’re too disorganized, too lazy, too fucked up, too erratic, too unstable. If you could work in the real world you would have stayed there because it is so many years of misery in comedy before you really start popping."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sheehan|first=Martina|date=June 19, 2010|title=Just For Laughs:  Greg Giraldo, host of the Nasty Show|url=http://timeoutchicago.com/things-to-do/out-about-blog/123692/just-for-laughs-greg-giraldo-host-of-the-nasty-show|publisher=TimeOut Chicago|accessdate=February 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2000, Giraldo was featured in an [[Esquire magazine]] article that profiled several members of the Harvard Law School class of 1990 who ended up choosing career paths other than the legal profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kurson|first=Robert|date=August 1, 2000|title=Who's Killing the Great Lawyers of Harvard?|url=http://www.esquire.com/features/killing-lawyers-harvard-0800|publisher=Esquire|accessdate=November 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kurson|first=Robert|date=September 29, 2010|title=Greg Giraldo Before He Was Greg Giraldo|url=http://www.esquire.com/features/greg-giraldo-obituary-092910|publisher=Esquire|accessdate=November 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After turning to comedy, Giraldo rarely discussed his prior career; the Esquire article was one of the few times he mentioned his days as a lawyer.

==Career==

Giraldo started doing stand-up comedy in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Downs|first=Gordon|date=December 1, 2010|title=Interview With Comedian Greg Giraldo|url=http://www.sandiego.com/articles/2010-12-01/interview-comedian-greg-giraldo|work=SanDiego.com|accessdate=August 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked who his comedic influences were, Giraldo stated: "For me, I wasn't really influenced by the good people. I was influenced by the (crappy) people. I would watch 'Evening at the Improv' and those kind of shows, and I'd think, 'Man, those guys blow so bad. I can do that.' And I went from there."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Geltner|first=Ted|date=October 7, 2005|title=Greg Giraldo sounds off on comedy, college|url=http://www.gainesville.com/article/20051007/DAYBREAK/51007006?tc=ar|publisher=The Gainesville Sun|accessdate=August 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Giraldo performed regularly at the [[Comedy Cellar]] comedy club in Manhattan, as well as clubs all over the U.S. Additionally, he was the star of the short-lived sitcom [[Common Law (1996 TV series)|''Common Law'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Connor|first=John J.|date=September 28, 1996|title=A Sitcom, Upscale and Latin|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/28/arts/a-sitcom-upscale-and-latin.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=February 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Giraldo landed the sitcom after being spotted by Hollywood agents at the 1995 [[Just for Laughs]] festival in [[Montreal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Court of Appeal|last=Johnson|first=Allan|date=September 24, 1996|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1996-09-24/features/9609240111_1_harvard-law-school-montreal-international-comedy-festival-common-law|publisher=''[[Chicago Tribune]]''|accessdate=December 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2002 to 2004, he was a regular panelist on ''[[Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Greg Giraldo|date=February 24, 2005|url=http://www.readjunk.com/interviews/giraldo-greg-comedian/|publisher=Read Junk|accessdate=December 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Giraldo also starred in several pilots, including ''Drive'' for [[CBS]] and ''The Greg Giraldo Show'', ''Adult Content'' and ''Gone Hollywood'' for [[Comedy Central]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Grelyak|first=Alana|date=February 16, 2007|title=Illogical conversations with Greg Giraldo|url=http://www.luminomagazine.com/mw/content/view/1755/4/|publisher=Lumino Magazine|accessdate=February 26, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140219143932/http://www.luminomagazine.com/mw/content/view/1755/4/|archivedate=February 19, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, he was featured in the spoken-word [[Lazyboy (musical project)|Lazyboy]] song "[[Underwear Goes Inside the Pants]]."

Giraldo performed more than a dozen times on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'', ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'', and ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'' and appeared regularly on ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]''. He also appeared as a member of the panel in the [[NBC]] show ''[[The Marriage Ref (U.S. TV series)|The Marriage Ref]]''.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;O'Connor, Anahad. [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/30/arts/30giraldo.html "Greg Giraldo, Insult-Humor Comic, Dies at 44"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', September 30, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Giraldo acted in two [[Adam Dubin]] features, 2002's comedic short ''American Dummy'', in which he played a psychiatrist, and 2008's animated film, ''What Blows Up Must Come Down!'', in which he did the voice of Jihad Jo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Adam Dubin: Short Films|url=http://www.adamdubin.com/short-films|accessdate=August 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also did the voice of President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] in the [[audiobook]] version of [[Sarah Vowell]]'s 2005 book ''[[Assassination Vacation]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vowell|first=Sarah|title=Assassination Vacation|year=2005|url=http://books.simonandschuster.com/Assassination-Vacation/Sarah-Vowell/9780743550291|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He appeared on ''[[The Late Late Show (CBS TV series)|The Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn]]'', ''[[Politically Incorrect]]'', ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]'', [[Fox News Channel]]'s ''The Full Nelson'' and ''Beyond the News'', [[Louie Anderson]]'s ''Comedy Showcase'', [[Comedy Central]]'s ''Comic Cabana'', [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]]'s ''Latino Comedy Festival'' and ''Funny is Funny'', as well as on the [[BBC]]'s ''Live at Jongleurs''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Madigan|first=Nick|date=July 12, 2001|title=Greg Giraldo:  From courtroom to standup circuit|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117802700?refCatId=1043|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=February 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Greg Giraldo|url=http://www.ramentertainment.com/Artists/Details/1222|publisher=Ram Entertainment and Special Event Services|accessdate=February 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Giraldo also performed at the United States Naval Base in [[Guantanamo Bay, Cuba]], as part of a [[USO]] tour in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bolster|first=John|date=September 30, 2010|title=Trading Punchlines with Comedy's Best|url=http://penthousemagazine.com/features/trading-punch-lines-with-comedys-best/|work=[[Penthouse Magazine]]|accessdate=February 3, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123184343/http://penthousemagazine.com/features/trading-punch-lines-with-comedys-best/|archivedate=November 23, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He had two half-hour specials on ''[[Comedy Central Presents]]'', wrote segments for ''[[Last Call with Carson Daly]]'', and was a panelist on Comedy Central's ''100 Greatest Stand-ups of All Time'' special. In 2004, his stand-up material was featured in Comedy Central's animated series ''[[Shorties Watchin' Shorties]]''. He appeared in both English and Spanish-language commercials for "1-800-OK-Cable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Greg Giraldo for 1-800-OK-Cable (Spanish 2)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn8Fhkku71Q|publisher=OK Cable}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Giraldo also appeared on the [[Independent Film Channel|IFC]] show, ''[[Z Rock (TV series)|Z Rock]]'', playing an angry record producer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hale|first=Mike|date=August 22, 2008|title=A Brooklyn Kiddie Band's R-Rated Mock Reality|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/23/arts/television/23zroc.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=February 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Giraldo said on ''Late Night with Conan O'Brien'' on July 7, 2005, that he had quit drinking alcohol. His series ''[[Friday Night Stand-Up with Greg Giraldo]]'' began on Comedy Central in late 2005 and ran until 2006. His CD ''[[Good Day to Cross a River]]'' was released in 2006 by [[Comedy Central Records]].  Greg was featured (along with [[Dane Cook]] and Sean Rouse) in ''Dave Attell's Insomniac Tour'', released April 2006. This 98-minute film is thought by many of his fans to be one of his best performances&amp;mdash;showing him on stage at work and also behind the scenes, with a glimpse of life on the road as a comedian.

Giraldo appeared in Comedy Central's annual [[roast (comedy)|roast]]s,&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; roasting [[Chevy Chase]], [[Pamela Anderson]], [[William Shatner]], [[Jeff Foxworthy]], [[Flavor Flav]], [[Bob Saget]], [[Joan Rivers]], [[Larry the Cable Guy]], and [[David Hasselhoff]], as well as the [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] roast of [[Cheech &amp; Chong]].

Giraldo was a regular on Comedy Central's television series ''[[Lewis Black's Root of All Evil]]'' and was one of the advocates lobbying for his side to be considered the "root of all evil." He won Black's decision in only two of his nine appearances but won the audience poll six times. Giraldo served as a judge during season seven of the [[NBC]] reality competition show ''[[Last Comic Standing]]''.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

In 2008, Giraldo appeared in venues across the United States as the headlining act of the Indecision '08 Tour, produced by Comedy Central. ''[[Midlife Vices]]'', his only one-hour special for Comedy Central, was released in 2009. In June 2010, Giraldo performed at the [[Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival]] in [[Tennessee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Greg Giraldo at Bonnaroo 2010|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywrWGTziPCU|accessdate=February 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same month, he hosted The Nasty Show in [[Chicago]], and in July, The Nasty Show in [[Montreal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brownstein|first=Bill|date=July 8, 2010|title=Nasty Show host Greg Giraldo sets high smut standard for the others|url=http://www2.canada.com/entertainment/from+archives+nasty+show+host+greg+giraldo+sets+high+smut+standard+others/3248880/story.html?id=3248880|work=The Gazette|accessdate=February 27, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022063436/http://www2.canada.com/entertainment/from+archives+nasty+show+host+greg+giraldo+sets+high+smut+standard+others/3248880/story.html?id=3248880|archivedate=October 22, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Giraldo was married twice.  His first marriage was at the age of 23 and lasted for two years.&lt;ref name=punchlineinterview&gt;Gadino, Dylan P. [http://punchlinemagazine.com/site/greg-giraldo-comedy-game-plan-in-effect/ "Greg Giraldo: Comedy game plan in effect"] (interview), ''[[Punchline (magazine)|Punchline]]'', October 29, 2009.

He married his second wife, Maryann, a former [[Caroline's]] comedy club waitress, on January&amp;nbsp;23, 1999, and together they had three sons. Giraldo had the tattoo "Maryann 1-23-99" on his right biceps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vimeo.com/1576317|title=Tattoo Fixation|accessdate=August 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Giraldo and Maryann separated in 2008 for a short time and had many reconciliations before his death. They were never divorced.

Giraldo also had a tribal design tattoo on his left forearm that contained the number 525. He was reluctant to discuss its meaning, but [[Jim Norton (American comedian)|Jim Norton]] of ''Opie and Anthony'' later said that it represented his sobriety struggle; May 25 was the day he initially sobered up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gadino|first=Dylan P.|date=October 1, 2010|title=Greg Giraldo: the never before seen 35-minute video interview|url=http://www.comedynews.org/stand-up/greg-giraldo-the-never-before-seen-35-minute-video-interview/link/7226/|publisher=Laughspin|accessdate=August 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Giraldo had been to rehab several times and stated that he had once been so intoxicated that he punched something and broke four bones in his hand while performing at [[Gotham Comedy Club]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Provenza|first=Paul|year=2010|title=Satiristas: Comedians, Contrarians, Raconteurs &amp; Vulgarians|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TCaXb0Fi4HEC&amp;pg=PT286&amp;lpg=PT286&amp;dq=paul+provenza+satiristas+greg+giraldo&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rO85vawPvq&amp;sig=30t8uxwJsi9jqz8bY9q3NMLYycg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=R-BnUPj-C-Pr0gHWs4GwCw&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=paul%20provenza%20satiristas%20greg%20giraldo&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 9, 2010, Comedy Central aired a special titled ''Comics Anonymous'', which had been filmed prior to Giraldo's death and featured several comedians who had been sober for 10 years or more.

On November 2, 2010, Comix comedy club in New York hosted the [[Jim Florentine]] roast, which Giraldo had originally been scheduled to perform at. Throughout the show, many of the comedians on the [[dais]] paid tribute to Giraldo, in roast-style fashion. Host [[Rich Vos]] joked: “I wasn’t the first choice to host.  Greg Giraldo was asked, but he said he’d rather be dead than host this.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gadino|first=Dylan P.|date=November 3, 2010|title=Comedian friends joke about Greg Giraldo's death at roast|url=http://www.laughspin.com/2010/11/03/comedian-friends-joke-about-greg-giraldos-death-at-roast/|publisher=Laughspin|accessdate=February 2, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207005227/http://www.laughspin.com/2010/11/03/comedian-friends-joke-about-greg-giraldos-death-at-roast/|archivedate=February 7, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 9, 2011, a benefit titled "The Big Time Comedy Show" was held at NYC's [[Beacon Theatre (New York City)|Beacon Theatre]] for Giraldo's sons and for a fund started in his memory designed, in Maryann Giraldo's words, "to help children living within families of addiction... to be educated, encouraged and empowered, and given the tools they need to make different choices in their lives."

[[Seth MacFarlane]], [[Anthony Jeselnik]], and [[Jeffrey Ross]] paid tribute to Giraldo during the ''Comedy Central Roast of Donald Trump'' in March 2011, and the roast was dedicated to him.
