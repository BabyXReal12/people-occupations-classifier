After his first divorce, Belzer relocated to [[New York City]], moved in with singer [[Shelley Ackerman]], and began working as a stand-up comic at [[Pips (comedy club)|Pips]], [[The Improv]], and [[Catch a Rising Star (comedy clubs)|Catch a Rising Star]].

===Film===
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Belzer became an occasional film actor. He is noted for small roles in ''[[Fame (1980 film)|Fame]]'', ''[[Café Flesh]]'', ''[[Night Shift (film)|Night Shift]]'', and ''[[Scarface (1983 movie)|Scarface]]''. He appeared in the [[music videos]] for the [[Mike + The Mechanics]] song "[[Taken In]]" and for the [[Pat Benatar]] song "Le Bel Age", as well as the [[Kansas (band)|Kansas]] video "Can't Cry Anymore". He appeared in ''[[A Very Brady Sequel]]'' as an [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] detective.

===Radio===
In addition to his film career, Belzer was a featured player on the ''[[National Lampoon Radio Hour]]'' with co-stars [[John Belushi]], [[Chevy Chase]], [[Bill Murray]], [[Gilda Radner]], and [[Harold Ramis]], a half-hour comedy program aired on 600 plus U.S. stations from 1973 to 1975.&lt;ref name=NPR&gt;{{cite web|work=[[NPR]]|title='The National Lampoon Radio Hour'|date=November 17, 2003|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1505048}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several of his sketches were released on National Lampoon albums, drawn from the Radio Hour, including several bits in which he portrayed a pithy call-in talk show host named "[[Dick Ballentine]]".

In the late 1970s, he co-hosted ''Brink &amp; Belzer'' on 660AM [[WFAN|WNBC]] radio in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aNECAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA33&amp;lpg=PA33&amp;dq=richard+belzer+disk+jockey&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=lbYgEIugfq&amp;sig=Qs1c8HlvHVk7jNjrVNdTAGlW1H4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjllaDhsqTTAhXMyFQKHcAUBiUQ6AEILzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=richard+belzer+disk+jockey&amp;f=false|title=New York Magazine|first=New York Media|last=LLC|date=2 July 1979|publisher=New York Media, LLC|accessdate=19 March 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been a frequent guest on ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]''.

Following the departure of [[Randi Rhodes]] from [[Air America Radio]], Belzer guest-hosted the afternoon program on the network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/04/10/richard-belzer-to-fill-in_n_96098.html | first = Danny | last = Shea | date = 18 April 2008 | title = Richard Belzer to Fill in During Randi Rhodes' Air America Time Slot |accessdate = 14 June 2014 |work = Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television===
In the 1990s, Belzer appeared frequently on television. He was a regular on ''[[The Flash (1990 TV series)|The Flash]]'' as a news anchor and reporter. In several episodes of ''[[Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]],'' he played [[Inspector William Henderson]].

He followed that with starring roles on the [[Baltimore]]-based ''[[Homicide: Life on the Street]]'' (1993–99) and the [[New York City|New York]]–based ''[[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit]]'' (1999–2013), portraying police detective [[John Munch]] in both series.&lt;ref name=TM/&gt; [[Barry Levinson]], executive director of ''Homicide'', said Belzer was a "lousy actor" in  audition when he read lines from the script for "[[Gone for Goode]]", the first episode in the series.&lt;ref name="Mendoza"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Mendoza |first=Manuel |title=Revisit 'Life on the Street' |work=[[The Dallas Morning News]] |date=2003-06-11 |location=[[Dallas]], [[Texas]] |page=1E}}&lt;/ref&gt; Levinson asked Belzer to take time to reread and practice the material, then read it again. At his second reading, Levinson said Belzer was "still terrible", but that the actor eventually found confidence in his performance.&lt;ref name="LevinsonComm"&gt;{{Cite video | people=[[Barry Levinson|Levinson, Barry]] |date=2003|title=Homicide Life on the Street – The Seasons 1 &amp; 2 |medium=DVD audio commentary |publisher=[[A&amp;E Television Networks|A&amp;E Home Video]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Belzer has played Munch in episodes on seven other series and in a sketch on one talk show, making Munch the only fictional character to appear on eleven different television shows played by a single actor{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}. These shows were on six different networks:

* ''[[Homicide: Life on the Street]]'' ([[NBC]])
* ''[[Law &amp; Order]]'' ([[NBC]])
* ''[[The X-Files]]'' ([[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]])
* ''[[The Beat (TV series)|The Beat]]'' ([[UPN]])
* ''[[Law &amp; Order: Trial by Jury]]'' ([[NBC]])
** Belzer's appearance on ''Trial by Jury'', which aired April 15, 2005, made him the third actor ever to play the same character in six different prime time TV series. The other two actors are [[John Ratzenberger]] and [[George Wendt]], who played [[Cliff Clavin]] and [[Norm Peterson]], respectively, in ''[[Cheers]]'' (1982–93); ''[[St. Elsewhere]]'' (1985); ''[[The Tortellis]]'' (1987); ''[[Wings (NBC TV series)|Wings]]'' (1990); ''[[The Simpsons]]'' (1994); and ''[[Frasier]]'' (2002).
* ''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]]'' ([[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]])
* ''[[The Wire (TV series)|The Wire]]'' ([[HBO]])
* ''[[30 Rock]]''&lt;ref name=TM/&gt; ([[NBC]])
** The characters are watching a ''Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit'' episode; a scene shot for ''30 Rock''
* ''[[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit]]'' ([[NBC]])
* ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'' ([[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]])
* ''[[Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt]]'' ([[Netflix]]), in which he played a John Munch-like character on a fictional ''Law &amp; Order'' spinoff.&lt;ref name=kimmyschmidt1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=kimmyschmidt2 /&gt;

In March 2016, executive producer Warren Leight announced Belzer would return to reprise the role in a May 2016 episode of ''Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit'', titled "Fashionable Crimes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/03/22/law-order-svu-richard-belzer-munch-returning|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] | title= 'Law &amp; Order: SVU': Richard Belzer returning as Detective Munch|first=Natalie|last=Abrams|date=March 22, 2016|accessdate=March 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Belzer portrayed Det. Munch for 22 consecutive seasons on ''Homicide'' (7 seasons) and ''Law &amp; Order: SVU'' (15 seasons), which exceeded the previous primetime live-action record of twenty consecutive seasons held by [[James Arness]] (who portrayed [[Marshal Matt Dillon]] on ''[[Gunsmoke]]'' from 1955 to 1975) and [[Kelsey Grammer]] (as Dr. [[Frasier Crane]] on ''[[Cheers]]'' and ''[[Frasier]]'' from 1984 to 2004).

Belzer appeared in several of [[Comedy Central]]'s televised broadcasts of [[New York Friars' Club|Friars Club]] roasts.   On June 9, 2001, Belzer himself was honored by the New York [[New York Friars' Club|Friars Club]] and the Toyota Comedy Festival as the honoree of the first-ever roast open to the public. Comedians and friends on the dais included Roastmaster [[Paul Shaffer]]; [[Christopher Walken]]; [[Danny Aiello]]; [[Barry Levinson]]; [[Robert Klein]]; [[Bill Maher]]; ''SVU'' costars [[Mariska Hargitay]], [[Christopher Meloni]], [[Ice-T]], and [[Dann Florek]]; and ''Law &amp; Order''{{'s}} [[Jerry Orbach]]. At the December 1, 2002, roast of [[Chevy Chase]], Belzer said, "The only time Chevy Chase has a funny bone in his body is when I fuck him in the ass." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.slate.com/id/2074752 | title = The Meanest Roast|accessdate = 2 December 2002 |work = Slate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Belzer voiced the character of Loogie for most of the episode of ''[[South Park]]'' titled "[[The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000]]".{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}  He and [[Brian Doyle-Murray]] were featured in the tenth-season premiere of ''[[Sesame Street]]''.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

===Author===
Belzer believes there was a [[John F. Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories|conspiracy to assassinate President John F. Kennedy]]&lt;ref name="Birnbaum"&gt;{{cite news |last=Birnbaum |first=Robert |date=November 18, 2013 |title=JFK Is Still Dead: Another Historiographical Moment |url=http://www.vqronline.org/books/jfk-still-dead-another-historiographical-moment |newspaper=Virginia Quarterly Review |location=Charlottesville, Virginia |accessdate=December 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has written four books discussing [[conspiracy theories]]: ''UFOs, JFK, and Elvis: Conspiracies You Don’t Have to Be Crazy to Believe''; ''Dead Wrong: Straight Facts on the Country’s Most Controversial Cover-Ups''; ''Hit List: An In-Depth Investigation into the Mysterious Deaths of Witnesses to the JFK Assassination''; and ''Someone Is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?''&lt;ref name="Elias"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Elias |first=Marilyn |date=Winter 2013 |title=Conspiracy Act |url=http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-report/browse-all-issues/2013/winter/conspiracy-act |journal=Intelligence Report |publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center |issue=152 |accessdate=December 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dead Wrong'' and ''Hit List'' were written with journalist David Wayne and reached [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]].&lt;ref name="Elias"/&gt; ''Someone Is Hiding Something'' was also written with David Wayne as well as radio talk show host [[George Noory]]. Belzer's long-time character, John Munch, also is  a believer in conspiracy theories, including the JFK assassination.

==Personal life==
Belzer's first two marriages were to  Gail Susan Ross (1966–72)&lt;ref name=people1993 /&gt; and boutique manager Dalia Danoch (1976 – c. 1978),&lt;ref name=people1993 /&gt; both of which ended in divorce.  In 1981 in [[Los Angeles]] he met 31-year-old [[Harlee McBride]], a divorcee with two daughters,&lt;ref name=sun&gt;{{cite news | url = http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1997-02-20/features/1997051147_1_richard-belzer-john-munch-mcbride | last = Hiaasen | first = Rob | title = Detective Mensch: A dark comic with a sweetheart of a soul, Richard Belzer has found a new life with 'Homicide' | work = [[The Baltimore Sun]] | date = February 20, 1997 | accessdate = October 7, 2012 | archivedate = October 7, 2012 | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/6BFN0vf8V?url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1997-02-20/features/1997051147_1_richard-belzer-john-munch-mcbride | deadurl = no | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bree Benton and Jessica.&lt;ref&gt;Hiaasen, [http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1997-02-20/features/1997051147_1_richard-belzer-john-munch-mcbride/3 p/ 3]&lt;/ref&gt; McBride, who had been seen in ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine four years earlier in that year's sex-in-cinema feature, in conjunction with ''Young Lady Chatterley'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Sex Stars of 1977| work =[[Playboy]] | date= December 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; was appearing in [[TV commercials]] for [[Ford]] motors and acting in free theater, when she met Belzer at the suggestion of a friend.&lt;ref name=sun /&gt; The two married in 1985.&lt;ref name=people1993&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20110060,00.html | title = Richard Belzer: His Wit Honed by Anger, He's a Comic Who Has Gone from Stand-Up to Homicide | work = [[People (magazine)|People]] | date = March 29, 1993 | volume =39 | issue= 12 | first = Peter | last= Castro}} RE Ross: "In 1971, a year before the end of his six-year marriage to Gail Susan Ross...."  RE Danoch: "In 1976. Belzer worked himself into a second marriage with Dalia Danoch, a boutique manager, but it ended in divorce less than two years later."&lt;/ref&gt;

Belzer survived [[testicular cancer]] in 1983.&lt;ref name= sun /&gt; His HBO special and comedy CD ''Another Lone Nut'' pokes fun at this medical incident as well as his status as a well-known [[conspiracy theorist]].

On March 27, 1985, days prior to the inaugural [[WrestleMania I|WrestleMania]], Belzer requested on his [[cable TV]] talk show ''Hot Properties'' that [[Hulk Hogan]] demonstrate one of his signature wrestling moves. After being asked by Belzer several times, Hogan put Belzer in a front chin-lock, which caused Belzer to pass out.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|i7n_SHrK408}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When Hogan released him, Belzer hit his head on the floor, sustaining a laceration to the scalp that required a brief hospitalization.&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,141573,00.html | title = Hype!

On October 20, 2006, on ''[[Bubba the Love Sponge]]'', it was claimed{{By whom|date=October 2012}} (with Hogan in the studio) that the settlement totaled $5 million, half from Hogan and half from wrestling promoter [[Vince McMahon]]. During his June 23, 2008, appearance on [[Sirius Satellite Radio]]'s ''The Howard Stern Show'', Belzer suggested that the settlement amount was closer to $400,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.howardstern.com|title=Howard Stern|author=|date=|website=Howard Stern|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=January 2014}}  He used the incident in his [[HBO]] special ''Another Lone Nut'' in his stand-up routine.

Belzer's older brother, Leonard Belzer (age 73) committed suicide in the early morning hours of July 30, 2014, by jumping from the roof of the New York City luxury apartment building in which he had resided.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Belzer’s father had also committed suicide in 1968.

Belzer is a cousin of actor [[Henry Winkler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.tvguide.com/PhotoGallery/Surprising-Celebrity-Family-1073313/1073326 |title=Henry Winkler Pictures, Richard Belzer Photos - Photo Gallery: Surprising Celebrity Family Ties |last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher=[[TV Guide]] |accessdate=October 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
