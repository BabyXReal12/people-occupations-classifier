'''Rachel Susan Dratch''' (born February 22, 1966) is an American actress, comedian, producer, and writer. Born and raised in [[Lexington, Massachusetts]], she graduated from [[Dartmouth College]] in 1988 and moved to [[Chicago, Illinois]], to study [[improvisational theatre]] at [[The Second City]] and [[ImprovOlympic]].

Her breakthrough came on the [[NBC]] television show ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (''SNL''), where she was a cast member from 1999 to 2006. In addition to her work on ''SNL'', she has appeared as a guest star in television shows such as ''[[The King of Queens]]'' and ''[[30 Rock]]'', as well as films such as ''[[Click (2006 film)|Click]]'' and ''[[I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry]]''. In 2012, she published her autobiographical book ''Girl Walks Into a Bar: Comedy Calamities, Dating Disasters and a Midlife Miracle''. She also portrayed the museum guard in Sesame Street's ''[[The Cookie Thief]]''.

==Early life==
Dratch was born in [[Lexington, Massachusetts]],&lt;ref name="lsmag05"/&gt; the daughter of Elaine Ruth (née Soloway), a transportation director, and Paul Dratch, a [[radiologist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/access/49831093.html?dids=49831093:49831093&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Feb+18%2C+2000&amp;author=Don+Aucoin%2C+Globe+Staff&amp;pub=Boston+Globe&amp;desc=LIVE!+FROM+LEXINGTON%2C+IT'S+RACHEL+DRATCH&amp;pqatl=google|work=Boston Globe|first=Don|last=Aucoin|title=Live!

Her younger brother, Daniel, is a television producer and writer, with credits including the TV series ''[[Anger Management (TV series)|Anger Management]]''.  Dratch grew up the "class clown type",&lt;ref name="lsmag05"/&gt; attending [[William Diamond Middle School]] and [[Lexington High School (Massachusetts)|Lexington High School]] in Massachusetts. She has said that even in her high school's plays she gravitated towards participating in comedies over dramas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://soundcloud.com/employeeofthemonthshow/racheldratch|title=RACHEL DRATCH on EMPLOYEE of the MONTH|publisher=SoundCloud}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dratch attended the [[Eugene O'Neill Theater Center|National Theater Institute at the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center]] in the fall of 1986,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kristina|first=Dorsey|title=Live! From New Haven! It's Rachel Dratch in "Celebrity Autobiography"!|journal=The Day|date=December 2010|url=http://www.theday.com/article/20101223/ENT12/312239576/-1/ENT04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and graduated from [[Dartmouth College]] in 1988, where she majored in drama and psychology and was a member of the improvisational comedy group "Said and Done".&lt;ref name="lsmag05"/&gt;

==Career==
Dratch was a member of the mainstage cast of The Second City comedy troupe for four years. She received the Joseph Jefferson award for Best Actress in a Revue for the two revues in which she performed: ''Paradigm Lost'' and ''Promisekeepers, Losers Weepers''. At The Second City, she performed alongside future ''SNL'' head writers [[Adam McKay]] and [[Tina Fey]], as well as future ''[[30 Rock]]'' performer [[Scott Adsit]]. The first incarnation of her ''SNL'' "Wicked" sketch was performed in The Second City's ''Paradigm Lost''. In addition to acting, Dratch also played the cello onstage. The theater also hosted the first incarnation of ''Dratch &amp; Fey'' (her critically praised two-woman show with Tina Fey&lt;ref name="wsj"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB96293436661558768?mod=googlewsj|title=Comic Duo Splits Sides|last=Townsend|first=Tim|date=July 7, 2000|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|accessdate=July 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;), which was later performed at the [[Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre]] in New York, where it was dubbed "the funniest thing to be found on any New York comedy stage" by ''[[Time Out New York]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Emmanuel |first=Greg |title=SNL's Tina Fey and Rachel Dratch have found a hilarious way to spend their summer vacations. |journal=Time Out New York |date=July 2000 |page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dratch has appeared in several movies, including ''[[Martin &amp; Orloff]]'', ''[[The Hebrew Hammer]]'', ''[[Down with Love]]'', ''[[Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star]]'', ''[[Click (2006 film)|Click]]'', ''[[I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry]]'', ''[[Spring Breakdown]]'', and ''[[My Life in Ruins]]''. She also has joined fellow ''SNL'' cast members on ''A.S.S.S.S.C.A.T.: Improv'', which aired September 7, 2005, on the [[Bravo (US TV channel)|Bravo]] channel.  Dratch also made television appearances on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Third Watch]]'' and in a recurring role on ''[[The King of Queens]]'' (playing Denise, the on-off girlfriend of Spence, who worked in a bowling alley). Other television appearances include ''[[Monk (TV series)|Monk]]'', ''[[Frasier]]'', ''[[Wizards of Waverly Place]]'', ''[[30 Rock]]'', ''[[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]]'', ''[[Inside Amy Schumer]]'', ''[[Ugly Betty]]'', and more recently, in season five of ''[[The Middle (TV series)|The Middle]]''. She also appeared online with comedian Billy Eichner in a spoof of [[Jay-Z]] and [[Alicia Keys]]'s "[[Empire State of Mind]]", titled "Forest Hills State of Mind."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nS5QyNC24w|title=Billy Eichner - Empire State Of Mind - Forest Hills State of Mind with Rachel Dratch|first=|last=Billy Eichner|date=17 January 2010|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dratch was originally cast in the role of Jenna on ''30 Rock'', and the original pilot episode features her in the role. It did not test well, and the role was recast. She went on to play a variety of small guest roles in several episodes of the first season, including Barbara Walters, Elizabeth Taylor, a cat trainer, a custodian, a blue monster, and a doctor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rosenblum|first=Emma|title=Rachel Rolls With It|url=http://nymag.com/news/intelligencer/22836/|work=[[New York Mag]]|date=October 15, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 19, 2012, Dratch's memoir, ''Girl Walks Into A Bar: Comedy Calamities, Dating Disasters, and a Midlife Miracle'' was published. In it, Dratch recounts her experiences after being recast in the ''30 Rock'' pilot, including the birth of her first child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gostin|first=Nicki|title='Girl Walks Into A Bar': Rachel Dratch Talks Baby, Life After 'SNL'|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/03/girl-walks-into-a-bar-rachel-dratch_n_1398418.html|accessdate=April 8, 2012|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=April 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Saturday Night Live''==
Her tenure at ''SNL'' spanned 1999 to 2006.  Dratch's [[Recurring Saturday Night Live characters and sketches|recurring characters]] included Denise, a Boston teen; Sheldon, the junior-high-school boy from ''Wake up, Wakefield''; one of the Luvahs (with [[Will Ferrell]], as two pretentious professors); Abe Scheinwald, a Hollywood producer with a terrible acquisition record; and, perhaps most memorably, [[Debbie Downer]], a depressed woman who creeped others out with disturbing [[Non sequitur (literary device)|non sequitur]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://snlarc.jt.org/cast.php?i=RaDr SNL Archives | Cast] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080224153746/http://snlarc.jt.org/cast.php?i=RaDr |date=2008-02-24 }}. Retrieved July 12, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2011, she made a guest appearance on ''Saturday Night Live's'' Christmas show, hosted by former cast member [[Jimmy Fallon]]. On April 15, 2017, she made another guest appearance with host Jimmy Fallon. On February 3, 2018 she made a guest appearance as a "Patriot of New England" in a [[American Revolution|Revolutionary War]]-themed sketch parodying the fans of the [[New England Patriots]] and [[Philadelphia Eagles]] in advance of [[Super Bowl LII]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Turchiano |first=Danielle |date=February 3, 2018 |title=Tina Fey, Rachel Dratch, Andy Samberg Return to ‘Saturday Night Live’ |url=https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/saturday-night-live-snl-2018-tina-fey-rachel-dratch-andy-samberg-natalie-portman-rap-1202686741/ |work=Variety |publisher=Variety Media, LLC |location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Both of Dratch’s parents were [[Reform Judaism|Reform Jews]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Burstein|first=Nathan|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/from-snl-to-performing-for-the-tribe|title=From 'SNL' to performing for the 'Tribe'|publisher=The Times of Israel|date=April 28, 2012|accessdate=May 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dratch attended Hebrew school and had a [[Bat Mitzvah]]. She is non-observant as an adult, and instead characterizes the faith she was born into as part of her [[cultural heritage]].&lt;ref name="lsmag05"&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051018124358/http://www.lifestylesmagazine.com/Lifestyle_10-2003_002.html|archivedate=October 18, 2005|url=http://www.lifestylesmagazine.com/Lifestyle_10-2003_002.html|title=Rachel Dratch|author=Gerri Miller|date=October 18, 2005|accessdate=October 28, 2010|quote=Raised in a Reform Jewish family, Dratch did have a ''Bat Mitzvah'' but does not consider herself to be observant. “It’s more a heritage thing, I guess,” she says of her relationship to her roots.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As she discusses in her book, ''Girl Walks Into a Bar ... '', Dratch met John Wahl, a Californian consultant in the [[natural foods]] industry, in a bar in 2009. Six months later, Dratch learned she was pregnant, and on August 24, 2010, gave birth to a boy, Eli Benjamin.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/2010/09/08/2010-09-08_former_saturday_night_live_alum_rachel_dratch_welcomes_first_son_eli.html Former 'Saturday Night Live' star Rachel Dratch welcomes first son Eli Benjamin], a September 8, 2010, article from the ''New York Daily News''&lt;/ref&gt; In an October 2010 interview, Dratch told ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' that her pregnancy at age 44 shocked her, because she "had bought into all this stuff about, 'Once you're over 40 ...'" and had "gone through the whole process of letting go of [the idea of having kids.]" Wahl has since moved to New York City to be closer to Dratch and their son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rachel Dratch Reveals Her Son's Father|publisher=People.com|date=October 27, 2010|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20437208,00.html|accessdate=October 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
