==Early life==
Toksvig was born in Denmark. Her father, [[Claus Toksvig]], was a Danish journalist, broadcaster, and foreign correspondent, so Toksvig spent most of her youth outside Denmark, mostly in New York City. Her mother, Julie Anne Toksvig (''[[née]]'' Brett), is British.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/13127990.Sandi_Toksvig_minds_her_manners/|first=Rebecca|last=McQuillan|title=Sandi Toksvig minds her manners |work = The Herald Scotland |date=18 October 2013 |accessdate=26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She attended [[Tormead School]], an independent girls' school near [[Guildford]], when her father was based in London. Her first job was a position as a [[follow spot]] operator for the musical ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]'' at the age of 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Toksvig|first=Sandi|date=24 January 2013|title=The Chain Of Curiosity |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=guobYpUxBj8C&amp;pg=PT113&amp;lpg=PT113&amp;dq=sandi+toksvig+jesus+christ+superstar&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=R6ZFFDWvvG&amp;sig=l1aiuxxTn6QYrJabmmYYh9pqnio&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-4haU7SgG6Gv7AaYzIDAAQ&amp;ved=0CGMQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=sandi%20toksvig%20jesus%20christ%20superstar&amp;f=false|location=London, UK|publisher=[[Hachette (publisher)|Hachette UK]]|isbn=9781405527231|accessdate=25 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3670221/Sandi-Toksvig-All-the-worlds-backstage.html|title=Sandi Toksvig: All the world's backstage|last1=Tokvsig |first1=Sandi |date=30 December 2007 |work= [[The Sunday Telegraph]] |accessdate=25 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012, in the wake of allegations about the behaviour of [[Jimmy Savile#Allegations of sexual abuse|Jimmy Savile]], and claims that during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, there was a culture within the BBC which [[Criticism of the BBC#Jimmy Savile sexual abuse allegations|tolerated sexual harassment]], she says she was groped by a "famous individual" on air in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-19861688 |title=Sandi Toksvig claims she was groped while broadcasting |date=7 October 2012 |work=[[BBC News Online]] |accessdate=9 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/07/sandi-toksvig-i-was-groped-on-air |title=Sandi Toksvig: 'I was groped on air in the 1980s' |date=7 October 2012 |work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=9 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Toksvig said the allegations of inappropriate behaviour at the BBC "did not surprise me at all".

On 28 April 2015, it was announced that Toksvig would leave BBC Radio 4's ''The News Quiz'' in June at the end of the 28th series, which was scheduled to begin on 15 May of that year. She said: "I have decided it is time to move on and, of course, I feel sad but I think it's the right moment. The show is in great shape and, like a good house guest, you should always depart when people still wish you'd stay a bit longer." The BBC said Toksvig had made the "difficult decision" to leave in order "to embark on a new and exciting stage of her career".&lt;ref name="BBC News 28 April 2015"&gt;{{cite news |title= Sandi Toksvig steps down from Radio 4's ''News Quiz'' |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-32495153 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= 28 April 2015 |work=[[BBC News Online]] | publisher = BBC |accessdate=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 April 2015, Toksvig announced that her decision to quit ''The News Quiz'' had been made in order to allow her to help set up a new political party named the [[Women's Equality Party]].&lt;ref name="Topping"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/apr/30/sandi-toksvig-quit-radio-4-news-quiz-set-up-womens-rights-political-party |title=Sandi Toksvig reveals she quit Radio 4 to set up women's rights political party |last1=Topping |first1=Alexandra |date=30 April 2015 |work=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Furness"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/bbc/11574333/Sandi-Toksvig-quit-The-News-Quiz-for-Womens-Equality-Party.html|title=Sandi Toksvig quit ''The News Quiz'' for Women's Equality Party |first=Hannah |last=Furness |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=30 April 2015 |accessdate=3 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
