'''Paul James Martin''' (born 9 July 1957), known professionally as '''Paul Merton''', is an English writer, actor, comedian, radio and television presenter.

Known for his [[improvisation]] skill,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/jul/27/itv.broadcasting|title=Merton plans ITV improv show|work=[[The Guardian]]|author=Tara Conlan |accessdate=9 December 2009 | location=London | date=27 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Merton's humour is rooted in [[deadpan]], [[surreal humour|surreal]] and sometimes [[Black comedy|dark]] comedy. He has been ranked by critics, fellow comedians and viewers to be among Britain's greatest comedians.&lt;ref name="observer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="channel4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt; He is well known for his regular appearances as a team captain on the [[BBC]] panel game ''[[Have I Got News for You]]'', and as the former host of ''[[Room 101 (TV series)|Room 101]]'', as well as for several appearances on the original British version of the improvisational comedy television show [[Whose Line Is It Anyway? (UK TV series)|Whose Line Is It Anyway?]]

He appears as a panellist regularly on [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]]'s ''[[Just a Minute]]''. He has also appeared as one of the [[The Comedy Store, London|Comedy Store]]'s [[The Comedy Store Players|Comedy Store Players]].

== Early life ==
Merton was born on 9 July 1957&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Merton, Paul (1957–)|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/499514/|work=[[Screenonline]]|publisher=[[British Film Institute]]|accessdate=2 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Parsons Green]], London,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Paul Merton: My family values|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/oct/17/paul-merton-my-family-values|newspaper=The Guardian|date=17 October 2014|author=Angela Wintle|accessdate=24 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; to an English Anglican father, Albert Martin (a [[train driver]] on the [[London Underground]]) and an Irish Roman Catholic mother, Mary Ann Power.&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite news|author=Barratt, Nick|title=Family detective|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/family/familyhistory/3354759/Family-detective.html|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=2 September 2011|location=London|date=6 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He attended St Thomas's School, [[Fulham]] and St Teresa's, [[Morden]]. He then went to [[Wimbledon College]], a [[Jesuit]]-run secondary school that was formerly a [[grammar school]] and had just become a [[comprehensive school|comprehensive]], in a stream for boys who had failed the [[11-plus]]&lt;ref name=Autobiography&gt;{{cite book|date=25 September 2015|author=Paul  Merton|isbn=978-0-09-194935-8|title= Only When I Laugh: My Autobiography |publisher=Ebury Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he received [[GCE Advanced Level|A-levels]] in English and History.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/tell-us-another-one-or-just-tell-us-the-same-one-all-over-again-paul-merton-the-comedian-with-the-dry-south-circular-delivery-is-probably-the-funniest-man-on-television-where-did-he-come-from-1541587.html|title=Tell us another one. Or just tell us the same one all over again|publisher=The Independent|accessdate=31 August 2010|first=Jim|last=White|location=London|date=21 August 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; After leaving school, Merton worked at the [[Tooting]] employment office as a clerical officer&lt;ref name="Autobiography" /&gt; for three years, quitting in February 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Paul Merton, Sledgehammer Confession, Long Distance Relationship Hacks |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0b9zf74|access-date= 23 July 2018 |series= Jo Whiley &amp; Simon Mayo|first= Paul|last= Merton|network= BBC|station= Radio 2 |date= 18 July 2018  |time= 1:36:31|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Merton often claims that he was inspired to go into comedy at an early age watching clowns at a circus, remembering, "I had no idea that adults could behave like that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/Entertainment/comedy/ThankGodYou-reHere/PaulMertonbiography/default.html |title=Thank God You're Here &amp;#124; ITV Entertainment &amp;#124; Paul Merton biography |publisher=Itv.com |date=9 January 2008 |accessdate=3 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He gained his earliest professional credits under his birth name, including an appearance as a [[yokel]] in ''[[Time (The Young Ones)|Time]]'', an episode of ''[[The Young Ones (TV series)|The Young Ones]]'' in 1984. On joining [[British Actors' Equity Association|Equity]] he found that the name Paul Martin was already taken, so he renamed himself after [[London Borough of Merton|Merton]], the district of London where he grew up.&lt;ref name=telegraph /&gt;

=== Stage ===
[[File:Merton2008.JPG|thumb|right|Merton in 2008]]
Though he had harboured serious ambitions of becoming a performing comedian since his school days, it was not until April 1982, at the [[The Comedy Store, London|Comedy Store]] in [[Soho]], that his dream was realised.&lt;ref name=jam&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/feb/16/paul-merton-manages-28-years-without-hesitation-repetition-or-deviation|title=Paul Merton on Just a Minute: 'Our worst contestant? Esther Rantzen'|author=Stuart Jeffries|date=16 February 2016|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=17 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"I made my professional debut in Swansea in 1982, and for that very fact I will I always have an affection for Wales.” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/whats-on/comedy-gigs/paul-merton-wales-thank-launching-6307885|title=Paul Merton on why he has Wales to thank for launching his comedy career|last=Owens|first=David|date=2013-11-15|work=walesonline|access-date=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

“What we did over the course of two weeks was perform 10 shows and it meant that our first time on stage if we made a mistake on the Monday we wouldn’t repeat that mistake the next day."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/whats-on/comedy-gigs/paul-merton-wales-thank-launching-6307885|title=Paul Merton on why he has Wales to thank for launching his comedy career|last=Owens|first=David|date=2013-11-15|work=walesonline|access-date=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He recalls that on only his second or third night he found the dour role that has informed his comic approach ever since.

He has been a member of the London improvisation group [[The Comedy Store Players]] since 1985, and still regularly performs with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comedystoreplayers.com/ |title=Comedy Store Players |publisher=Comedy Store Players |accessdate=3 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Merton has performed in Paul Merton's Impro Chums at [[Pleasance]] as part of the [[Edinburgh Comedy Festival]] every year from 2008.

=== Television ===
His breakthrough as a television performer came in 1988 with Channel 4's improvised comedy show ''[[Whose Line Is It Anyway? (UK TV series)|Whose Line Is It Anyway?]]'', which moved to TV from [[BBC Radio 4]], though he had previously performed on the channel's ''[[Saturday Live (UK TV series)|Saturday Live]]'' and compered its series Comedy Wavelength in 1987. He remained on ''Whose Line'' until 1993. ''[[Have I Got News for You]]'' began in 1990, and two series of his own [[sketch show]], ''[[Paul Merton: The Series]]'', followed soon after.  In 1995 he presented a documentary series celebrating the history of the London Palladium, entitled ''[[Paul Merton's Palladium Story]]''. In 1996, Merton performed updated versions of fifteen of [[Ray Galton]] and [[Alan Simpson (scriptwriter)|Alan Simpson]]'s old scripts for an ITV series, ''[[Paul Merton in Galton and Simpson's...|Paul Merton in Galton &amp; Simpson's...]]''. Six of these scripts were previously performed by [[Tony Hancock]]. These were very badly received by critics, and although a selection of episodes was initially released on VHS, it was not until June 2007 that the complete series was released on DVD.

Also in 1996, Merton took a break from ''Have I Got News for You'' during its eleventh series, making only one appearance as a guest on fellow captain [[Ian Hislop]]'s team. Merton later explained that at the time he was "very tired" of the show and that he thought it had become "stuck in a rut". Nevertheless, he added that he felt his absence gave the programme the "shot in the arm" it needed and that it had been "better ever since".&lt;ref&gt;''The Very Best of Have I Got News for You'' (2002): DVD commentary&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, following allegations in the UK tabloids linking the show's chairman, [[Angus Deayton]], with prostitutes and drug use, the host was asked to resign from the show. Merton hosted the first episode after Deayton's departure and was described as "merciless" in his treatment of his former co-star.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/2384165.stm |title=Show goes on after Deayton exit |publisher=BBC News |date=1 November 2002 |accessdate=3 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999 Merton replaced [[Nick Hancock]] as host of ''[[Room 101 (TV series)|Room 101]]'', a chat show in which guests are offered the chance to discuss their pet hates and consign them to the oblivion of [[Room 101]]. His first guest was Hancock. He hosted 64 editions. In 2007, his final guest was Ian Hislop (who became the first interviewee to appear twice, having also been on an edition with Hancock). Hislop's selections purposely included items that Merton was known to like, such as [[The Beatles]] and the films of [[Charlie Chaplin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=No Room for Merton|work=Chortle|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2006/12/09/4793/no_room_for_merton|date=2006-12-09|accessdate=9 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hislop's final choice was Merton himself, done to represent his departure from the show.  Merton cast himself in the room to end the show, although on the condition that Hislop would go in with him.

Merton is one of the recurring stars from the 4 [[ITV Panto]]s. His best role came in 1999, where Merton starred alongside [[Ronnie Corbett]] as one of the ugly sisters in [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s Christmas [[pantomime]] of Cinderella. His other co-stars were [[Julian Clary]], [[Samantha Janus]], [[Ben Miller]], [[Harry Hill]], [[Frank Skinner]] and [[Alexander Armstrong (comedian)|Alexander Armstrong]].

In the same year, to coincide with the launch of his first stand up tour in 10 years, ''and this is me...Paul Merton'', he was given his own one hour ''[[South Bank Show]]'' special. The show charted his beginnings in the comedy business, to the development of his improvisational skills, his mental breakdown, and the popularity of ''Have I Got News For You''.

[[File:Paulmerton.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Merton at [[Ely, Cambridgeshire|Ely]] Maltings in 2007, after giving a talk on his book ''Silent Comedy'']]

He was rumoured to be a possible new host of ''[[Countdown (game show)|Countdown]]'' to replace both [[Richard Whiteley]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pickard |first=Anna |url=http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/culturevulture/archives/2005/09/05/moustache_9_let.html |title=Filling Richard's shoes from Guardian Unlimited: Culture Vulture |publisher=Blogs.guardian.co.uk |accessdate=3 March 2010 | location=London |date=19 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his successor, [[Des Lynam]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/5402246.stm |title=Entertainment &amp;#124; Holmes and Aspel lead Lynam race |publisher=BBC News |date=3 October 2006 |accessdate=3 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but decided not to pursue this.

Merton is a keen student of comedy, particularly the early silent comedians&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jury, Louise|title=Paul Merton: Have I got laughs for you|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/paul-merton-have-i-got-laughs-for-you-681874.html|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=31 August 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2006, [[BBC Four]] broadcast ''Paul Merton's Silent Clowns'', a four-part documentary series on the silent comedy craft of [[Buster Keaton]], [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[Laurel and Hardy]] and [[Harold Lloyd]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/cinema/features/silent-clowns.shtml | title=BBC Four: ''Paul Merton's Silent Clowns'' | publisher=BBC | accessdate=21 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Merton examined their respective careers, interspersed with moments from a live show in which he presented clips of their work. Among the audience were many children, who were seeing the performers for the first time. Merton took a stage version of this show to the 2006 Edinburgh Fringe Festival and in late 2007 took the show on a UK tour. A tie-in book was written by Merton and published by RH Books in late 2007. ''The Independent'' described it as "clearly a labour of love" but criticised the exhaustive and overly-thorough plot synopses of the films discussed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first= William|last= Cook|title= Silent Comedy, by Paul Merton|url= http://arts.independent.co.uk/books/reviews/article3164441.ece|work= [[The Independent]]|date= 15 November 2007|accessdate= 12 January 2008|location= London}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Merton is set to open the third Yorkshire Silent Film Festival in Leeds on 08 May 2018 presenting films by [[Buster Keaton]], [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[Laurel and Hardy]] and [[Harold Lloyd]] along with live improvised piano by [[Neil Brand]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.yorkshiresilentfilm.com | title=Yorkshire Silent Film Festival: ''Paul Merton's Silent Clowns'' | publisher=YSFF | accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Also in 2007 he presented a four-part travel documentary, ''[[Paul Merton in China]]'', which was broadcast on [[Channel 5 (UK)|Five]] from 21 May 2007. His second travel series, ''[[Paul Merton in India]]'' was transmitted from 8 October 2008 on the same channel. A third series, ''[[Paul Merton in Europe]]'' began broadcasting on 11 January 2010, again on Five.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.five.tv/programmes/documentaries/paul-merton-in-europe |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120804174928/http://www.five.tv/programmes/documentaries/paul-merton-in-europe |dead-url=yes |archive-date=4 August 2012 |title=Paul Merton in Europe |publisher=Five.tv |accessdate=3 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 he was commissioned by [[More4]] to present ''[[Paul Merton's Secret Stations|Paul Merton’s Secret Stations]]'', a travel documentary series about some of Britain’s little-used [[request stop]] railway stations inspired by travel writer [[Dixe Wills]]' book ''Tiny Stations''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Paul Merton, station master: Comic takes to the railways for new documentary |url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2015/07/08/22799/paul_merton%2C_station_master |website=www.chortle.co.uk |location= |date=8 July 2015 |access-date=11 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Merton hosted the British version of ''[[Thank God You're Here (UK TV series)|Thank God You're Here]]'', which aired on ITV in 2008.

In 2009, Merton directed and presented a documentary on the British films of [[Alfred Hitchcock]], in a series of star-presented documentaries on [[BBC Four]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/sep/12/television Merton and Hislop extend their rivalry on BBC4]. The Guardian. 12 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
In May 2010, Merton temporarily co-presented [[The One Show]] for two weeks on Thursday after [[Adrian Chiles]] left the show.

His three-part documentary series ''[[Paul Merton's Birth of Hollywood]]'' about the early history of Hollywood was broadcast in May 2011 on BBC2. In Merton's third TV series for 2011, ''[[Paul Merton's Adventures]]'', he travels around the world going on popular tourist trails, but still manages to find some extraordinary things.

=== Radio ===
In the late 1980s, Merton appeared on BBC Radio 4's ''[[The Big Fun Show (radio show)|The Big Fun Show]]''. After long-time ''[[Just a Minute]]'' panellist [[Kenneth Williams]] died in 1988, Merton (a fan of the show) contacted the producer at the suggestion of the host, [[Nicholas Parsons]]. He was invited to participate during the following year and has appeared regularly on the programme ever since.&lt;ref&gt;''Clement Freud on Just a Minute: A Celebration'', BBC Radio 4, 26 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 Merton overtook Williams to become the second most regular panellist, surpassed only by [[Clement Freud]].&lt;ref name=jam/&gt;

Besides his work on ''Just a Minute'', Merton was a semi-regular guest on ''[[I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue]]'' from 1991 to 1998. Between 1993 and 1995, Merton was among the regular cast members on the Radio 4 improvisational comedy series ''[[The Masterson Inheritance]]''. In 2000 he presented ''Two Priests and a Nun Go into a Pub'', in which he interviewed British and Irish comedians who had (like Merton himself) been brought up as members of the Roman Catholic Church. In 2009, Merton started a Radio 4 series in which he reads [[Spike Milligan]]'s war memoirs in an audio-book fashion.

== Personal life ==
Merton married actress [[Caroline Quentin]] in 1990; they announced their separation in April 1997, which was followed by divorce in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2000/oct/29/features.magazine37|title=Paul Merton interview: fears of a clown|author=Lynn Barber|work=The Observer|date= 29 October 2000|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Merton subsequently had a relationship with producer and actress [[Sarah Parkinson]]; they were married unofficially in a service in the Maldives in 2000. They were officially married three months before her death from breast cancer on 23 September 2003. He married fellow improviser Suki Webster in 2009. He is an avid [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] fan.

Shortly before becoming a household name on ''Have I Got News for You'', Merton booked himself into the [[Maudsley Hospital|Maudsley psychiatric hospital]] for six weeks, because of psychiatric problems caused by the malaria medicine [[Lariam]].&lt;ref name="mirror"&gt;{{cite news|author=Kevin Maguire |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/inside-the-mind-of-paul-merton-ahead-774356 |title=Inside the mind of Paul Merton |publisher=mirror.co.uk |date= 28 March 2012|accessdate=25 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with ''[[The Guardian]]'' he was reported to have been "hallucinating conversations with friends, and became convinced he was a target for the [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]]".&lt;ref name="guardian2"&gt;{{cite news|author=Barbara Ellen |url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,,1386064,00.html |title=Barbara Ellen meets Paul Merton &amp;#124; &amp;#124; guardian.co.uk Arts |publisher=Arts.guardian.co.uk |date= 9 January 2005|accessdate=3 March 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He used the Maudsley episode as a key framework in his 2012 tour, ''Out of My Head''. He gave many examples of his experiences there, conversations with staff and fellow patients were played out as sketches with his fellow performers, [[Richard Vranch]], [[Lee Simpson]] and Suki Webster.
