===Early years===
Provenza was born and grew up in the [[Pelham Parkway (neighborhood), Bronx|Pelham Parkway]] section of the [[Bronx]], [[New York City]], and graduated in 1975 from the [[Bronx High School of Science]].  In high school, he started performing [[stand-up comedy]], making his stage debut at age 17 at the original [[The Improv]] in [[Manhattan]]. He continued performing while attending the [[University of Pennsylvania]], taking a year's leave of absence to study in [[London]] at the [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts]]. While at RADA, he joined a classical repertory theater group, becoming one of few Americans to perform the role of Romeo on the London stage.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  He graduated in 1979 from the University of Pennsylvania, the year it awarded its first [[Theatre Arts]] degree. At Penn, he wrote for the [[Pennsylvania Punch Bowl]] and was a cast member of the [[Mask and Wig]] Club, where he has returned numerous times to perform in the annual Intercollegiate Comedy Festival.

===Television work===
Provenza made his first appearance on [[The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson]] on March 25, 1983. Additional television work includes hosting a short-lived [[Nickelodeon]] TV show from 1988 until 1989 called ''[[Kids Court]]'', appearing as Patrick in ''[[Empty Nest]]'', and playing Dr. Phil Capra in Season 6 of CBS's ''[[Northern Exposure]]'', opposite [[Teri Polo]].

===Stand up, theatre and radio work===
While working as a standup comedian and on television, Provenza also found work in theatre. He received critical acclaim for his work on stage, with his performance in the [[Off-Broadway]] play ''Only Kidding!'' being nominated for a [[Drama Desk Award]] for Best Actor and winning the [[Theater World Award]] for Best Actor in a Play.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  He was the stand-up comedian opening act for [[Diana Ross]] for three years or more.  He was honored with a [[caricature]] by the legendary [[Al Hirschfeld]].  He also is a frequent panelist on ''[[Wait Wait Don't Tell Me]]'' on [[National Public Radio]]

===Directing===
After decades as a stand-up comic and actor, Provenza found a new calling as an interviewer of other stand-ups, culminating in his 2005 directorial debut, ''[[The Aristocrats (film)|The Aristocrats]]''&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; (made with [[Penn Jillette]]).  At the 2006 [[Edinburgh Fringe|Edinburgh Fringe Festival]], Provenza held a nightly show at the [[Underbelly Limited|Underbelly]], ''Talk of the Fest''. Held at 11pm each night of the festival, the set up was described by Provenza as that of a "[[green room]] for the whole festival". Guests included [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]], the creators of ''[[South Park]]''. The show was reprised by Provenza at the 2007 ''[[Just for Laughs]]'' comedy festival in [[Montreal]], where guests included [[Billy Connolly]], [[Eddie Izzard]], and members of ''[[The Kids in the Hall]]''. In 2010, [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] picked up the show and on June 12, 2010, ''[[The Green Room with Paul Provenza]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Green Room with Paul Provenza on Showtime|url = http://www.sho.com/sho/the-green-room-with-paul-provenza/home|website = SHO.com|accessdate = 2015-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; debuted with many of the same festival guest line-ups.

===Producing===
In 2011, Provenza began developing a new show called [[Set List - Stand-Up Without A Net]]. The show was originally devised by Troy Conrad and features stand-up comedians who are made to improvise their sets based on suggestions they receive. After successful appearances at worldwide comedy festivals including  [[Just For Laughs]], the [[Melbourne Comedy Festival]] and the [[Edinburgh Fringe]], it was picked up for television by UK broadcaster [[Sky Atlantic]]. The series included performers [[Robin Williams]], [[Drew Carey]] and [[Frank Skinner]] and was also broadcast in Australia on [[ABC2]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=British Comedy Guire | title=Circuit Training 42: The Aristocratic Paul Provenza | url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/live/circuit_training/paul_provenza_interview/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Paul Provenza and Dan Dion on Satiristas - Arts - Browse - Big Ideas - ABC TV|url = http://www.abc.net.au/tv/bigideas/stories/2010/09/07/3003999.htm|website = www.abc.net.au|accessdate = 2015-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious skepticism===
Provenza was [[Master of Ceremonies]] at the 2012 [[Reason Rally]] held on the mall in [[Washington, DC]], welcoming a crowd of approximately 30,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Agence France-Presse | title=Thousands of US atheists turn out for 'Reason Rally' | url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/252668/news/world/thousands-of-us-atheists-turn-out-for-reason-rally | work=GMA News | date=25 March 2012 | accessdate=25 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Author===
In May, 2010, Provenza's book, ''¡Satiristas!'', with photography by [[Dan Dion]] was released by Harper-Collins. It features in-depth interviews with [[Stephen Colbert]], [[Bill Maher]], [[George Carlin]], [[Marc Maron]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ¡SATIRISTAS! -The Book|url = http://www.satiristas.com/|website = Satiristas|accessdate = 2015-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Show for May 30, 2010.
