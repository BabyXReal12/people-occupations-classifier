'''Horacio Sanz'''&lt;ref&gt;"Cayendo Episode of the Hooray Show (https://soundcloud.com/the-hooray-show/cayendo) at 5:58, Horatio reveals his legal name is Horacio&lt;/ref&gt; (born June 4, 1969), better known by his stage name '''Horatio Sanz''', is a Chilean-born American actor and comedian. He was a cast member on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' from 1998–2006.

==Early life and career==
Sanz, the youngest of three sons, was born in [[Santiago, Chile]], to Sylvia and Carlos Sanz.&lt;ref&gt;[https://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800420534/bio Horatio Sanz Biography - Yahoo! Movies]&lt;/ref&gt; He is the younger brother of actor [[Carlos Sanz]]. He grew up in the North-Pulaski area of the [[Humboldt Park, Chicago|Humboldt Park]] neighborhood on the [[West Side, Chicago|West Side]] of [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]. He became an American citizen on July 25, 2018 in Los Angeles, California.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/MrHoratioSanz/status/1022303565736554496|title=Horatio Sanz on Twitter|work=Twitter|access-date=2018-08-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sanz performed at various theaters in Chicago, including The Court Theater and [[The Second City]], where he was a member of their Chicago ETC theater. While in Chicago, Sanz was also one of the founding members of the [[Upright Citizens Brigade]] (UCB) [[sketch comedy]] and [[improv comedy|improv]] troupe. Sanz can still be seen regularly performing with the sketch troupe at their long-running hit improv show "ASSSSCAT 3000", at both of the UCB's popular comedy theaters located in [[New York City]] and [[Los Angeles]].

Sanz was part of the cast of the short-lived [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] sitcom ''[[In the Motherhood (TV series)|In The Motherhood]]'' in 2009, playing the role of Horatio the "manny" (male [[nanny]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvguide.com/News/Horatio-Sanz-Jessica-1000151.aspx Horatio Sanz Embraces Motherhood]" ''[[TV Guide]]''. November 24, 2008. Retrieved on November 26, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Sanz and his former ''SNL'' castmate [[Chris Parnell]] starred together on ''[[Big Lake (TV series)|Big Lake]]'', a [[Comedy Central]] sitcom from executive producers [[Will Ferrell]] and [[Adam McKay]]. From 2010 to 2011, Sanz was a writer and producer on the [[Comedy Central]] sketch series ''[[Nick Swardson's Pretend Time]]''.

In November 2008, Sanz made his first public appearance in almost a year, after having lost {{convert|100|lb|kg stlb|lk=out}}. "I've been eating better," he admitted. Sanz quipped, "I've been trying to come up with a joke about how I've lost weight and I was going to say, 'I stopped putting nuts in my sundaes.'" He also says, "I never weighed myself when I was at my fattest, because I was scared I might die'." Sanz says he has been working out, too. In June 2009, he appeared on ''[[Late Night with Jimmy Fallon]]'' and claimed that much of his weight loss was because he had stopped drinking [[alcoholic beverage]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.latenightwithjimmyfallon.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, he started his own podcast called ''The Hooray Show'', which features comedy sketches and interviews with his friends in comedy.

==''Saturday Night Live''==
Sanz joined the cast of ''Saturday Night Live'' in September 1998. At the beginning of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'s'' 31st season, he was the temporary replacement for [[Tina Fey]] as [[Amy Poehler]]'s [[Weekend Update]] co-anchor while Fey was on [[maternity leave]] until she resumed her duties on October 22, 2005. On September 20, 2006, ''Saturday Night Live'' announced that Sanz would not be returning due to massive budget cuts that called for Lorne Michaels to either cut back on show production or get rid of long-standing or poor-performing cast members.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Sanz returned to ''SNL'' as a guest on February 3, 2007, appearing as [[Elton John]], and again on November 3, as presidential candidate [[Bill Richardson]] and yet again on the December 17, 2011 Christmas show as himself in a musical number ("I Wish It Was Christmas Today") and as a member of Beethoven's orchestra ("Beethoven: Meet The Band").
