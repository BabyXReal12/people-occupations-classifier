On 16 May 2016, Wilson said print and online articles in ''Woman's Day'', the Australian ''Women's Weekly'', ''[[NW (magazine)|NW]]'' and ''OK!'' magazines made her out to be a serial liar. According to a [[defamation]] writ filed in the [[Supreme Court of Victoria]], Wilson said her reputation and credit had suffered and she had been humiliated and embarrassed. She also sued for special damages, claiming she missed out on roles and other ones were terminated because of the articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/rebel-wilson-sues-magazine-publisher-over-stories-about-her-age-20160516-gowi9a.html |title = Rebel Wilson sues magazine publisher Bauer Media over stories about her age |last = Ham |first = Larissa |date = 16 May 2016 |work = [[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |accessdate = 16 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson was represented by [[Matthew Collins (barrister)|Matthew Collins QC]]. On 15 June 2017, a six-person jury ruled in Wilson's favour, finding that publisher [[Bauer Media Group]] had indeed wrongly painted the actress as a serial liar, and that publishing the articles was likely to have caused harm to her career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jun/15/rebel-wilson-wins-defamation-trial-against-bauer-media |title = Rebel Wilson wins defamation trial against Bauer Media |date = 15 June 2017 |work = [[The Guardian]] |accessdate = 17 June 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 September 2017, Wilson was awarded {{A$|4500000|link=yes}} in damages. Wilson's lawyer Richard Leder, said "Today's verdict is a significant record—it's about four times the highest previous verdict in a defamation case in Australia". In June 2017, Wilson tweeted "Any dollars I receive will go to charity, scholarships or invested into the Aussie film industry to provide jobs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-09-13/rebel-wilson-defamation-damages/8936850 |title = Rebel Wilson awarded $4.5m in damages over defamatory magazine articles |date = 13 September 2017 |last1 = Florance |first1 = Loretta |last2 = Younger |first2 = Emma |website = abc.net.au |access-date = 13 September 2017 |dead-url = no |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170913090952/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-09-13/rebel-wilson-defamation-damages/8936850 |archive-date = 13 September 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.latimes.com/sns-bc-as--australia-people-rebel-wilson-20170913-story.html |title = Rebel Wilson awarded millions in Australia defamation case |date = 13 September 2017 |website = latimes.com |access-date = 13 September 2017 |dead-url = no |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170913092858/http://www.latimes.com/sns-bc-as--australia-people-rebel-wilson-20170913-story.html |archive-date = 13 September 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==

In July 2011, Wilson became a spokesperson for weight loss and nutrition company [[Jenny Craig, Inc.|Jenny Craig]] in Australia.&lt;ref name="JC"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.jennycraig.com.au/friendofjenny/rebelwilson/about |title = Rebel Wilson |publisher = Jenny Craig, Australia &amp; New Zealand |accessdate = 15 August 2011 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110720031826/http://www.jennycraig.com.au/friendofjenny/rebelwilson/about/ |archivedate = 20 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.heraldsun.com.au/entertainment/confidential/rebel-wilson-seeks-to-slim-down-for-career/story-e6frf96x-1226097108580 |title = Rebel Wilson seeks to slim down for career |date = 19 July 2011 |work = [[Herald Sun]] |publisher = [[The Herald and Weekly Times]] |accessdate = 15 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2012, Wilson told ''[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]'' that she had lost {{convert|10|kg}} since signing up to the program.&lt;ref name="StayingBig"&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/why-rebel-wilson-will-be-staying-big-in-hollywood/story-e6frewyr-1226250311877 |title = Why Rebel Wilson will be staying big in Hollywood |last = Wigney |first = James |author2 = Halliwell, Elle |date = 22 January 2012 |work = [[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]] |publisher = [[News Limited]] |accessdate = 21 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson asserted that the producers of ''[[Pitch Perfect]]'' had refused to let her lose any more weight during filming, as her contract stated she must stay the same size. She said that once her film commitments were over, she would start her diet again to reach her target weight of {{convert|80|kg}}.&lt;ref name="StayingBig" /&gt; In February 2013, she confirmed that she had ended her agreement with Jenny Craig the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/sydney-confidential/rebel-wilson-talks-on-split-with-jenny-craig/story-e6frewz0-1226580846065 |title = Rebel Wilson talks about split with Jenny Craig |last = Christie |first = Joel |date = 19 February 2013 |work = [[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]] |publisher = [[News Limited]] |accessdate = 22 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson and her ''Bridesmaids'' co-star [[Matt Lucas (comedian)|Matt Lucas]] lived together in [[West Hollywood, California|West Hollywood]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/showbiz/news/a403406/bridesmaids-rebel-wilson-matt-lucas-live-together-annoy-neighbours.html |title = 'Bridesmaids' Rebel Wilson, Matt Lucas live together, annoy neighbours |last = Wightman |first = Catriona |date = 3 September 2012 |work = [[Digital Spy]] |publisher = [[Hearst Magazines UK]] |accessdate = 17 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; from September 2012 until 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/34384678/matt-lucas-on-rebel-wilson-moving-out-and-being-the-boss |title = Matt Lucas on Rebel Wilson moving out and being the boss |publisher = BBC |date = 29 September 2015 |accessdate = 13 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2015, Wilson stated her support for stricter American gun laws following the [[2015 Lafayette shooting]], stating, "I don't like getting political but America you really have to follow Australia's example re gun laws. I don't remember a mass shooting in Australia since they [[Gun laws in Australia#Port Arthur massacre and its consequences|overhauled the gun laws]]. It seems like every week in America there's a shooting.
