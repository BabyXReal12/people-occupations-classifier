His biological and adoptive fathers are both African-American, and his biological and adoptive mothers are both Caucasian; he has met his biological mother, Carrie Herr.&lt;ref name=newyorker&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/brother-another-mother|title=Brother from Another Mother|first=Zadie |last=Smith|date=February 23, 2015|work=The New Yorker|accessdate=May 9, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160506145330/http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/brother-another-mother|archivedate=May 6, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later also discovered that he had two half-brothers who were both already deceased; one of them comic book writer [[Dwayne McDuffie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=You Made It Weird #275: Keegan-Michael Key|url=http://nerdist.com/you-made-it-weird-275-keegan-michael-key/|publisher=Nerdist Podcast|accessdate=October 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Keegan-Michael Key Has Learned That He And Dwayne McDuffie Were Half Brothers|url=http://www.bleedingcool.com/2015/09/18/keegan-michael-kay-has-learned-that-he-and-dwayne-mcduffie-were-half-brothers/|publisher=[[BleedingCool.com]]|accessdate=October 9, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20151006081538/http://www.bleedingcool.com/2015/09/18/keegan-michael-kay-has-learned-that-he-and-dwayne-mcduffie-were-half-brothers/|archivedate=October 6, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Being biracial has been a source of comedic material for Key, who told [[Terry Gross]] in an interview for [[NPR]], "I think the reason [[Jordan Peele|Jordan]] and I became actors is because we did a fair amount of [[code-switching]] growing up and still do."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2013/12/31/256605611/for-key-and-peele-biracial-roots-bestow-special-comedic-power|title=For Key And Peele, Biracial Roots Bestow Special Comedic 'Power'|date=December 31, 2013|work=NPR.org|accessdate=May 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inamerica.blogs.cnn.com/2012/02/24/key-peele-the-color-of-funny/|title='Key &amp; Peele': The color of funny|last=Siek|first=Stephanie|publisher=[[CNN]]|date=February 24, 2012|accessdate=March 3, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302123200/http://inamerica.blogs.cnn.com/2012/02/24/key-peele-the-color-of-funny/|archivedate=March 2, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Mad TV''===
Key joined the cast of ''[[Mad TV]]'' midway into the ninth season. He and [[Jordan Peele]] were cast against each other so that FOX could pick one black cast member, but both ended up being picked after demonstrating great comedic chemistry. {{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} Key played many characters on the show. One of his most famous characters is "Coach Hines", a high school sports coach who frequently disrupts and threatens students and faculty members. On the penultimate episode of ''Mad TV'', Hines revealed that he is the long-lost heir to the Heinz Ketchup company and only became a Catholic school coach to help delinquent teenagers like Yamanashi ([[Bobby Lee]]). During seasons 9 and 10, Key appeared as "Dr. Funkenstein" in blaxploitation parodies, with Jordan Peele playing the monster.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} Key also portrayed various guests on ''Real **********ing Talk'' like the strong African Rollo Johnson and blind victim Stevie Wonder Washington. He often goes "backstage" as Eugene Struthers, an always-ecstatic water- or flower-delivery man who accosts celebrities. There is also "Jovan Muskatelle", a shirtless man with a jheri curl and a shower cap. He interrupts live news broadcasts by a reporter (always played by [[Ike Barinholtz]]), annoying him with rapid fire accounts of events that have happened frequently exclaiming "It was crazy as hell!" {{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} Celebrities that Key impersonated on the show include [[Ludacris]], [[Snoop Dogg]], [[Roscoe Orman]] (as his character [[Gordon (Sesame Street)|Gordon]] from ''[[Sesame Street]]''), [[Matthew Lillard]], [[Bill Cosby]], [[Al Roker]], [[Terrell Owens]], [[Tyler Perry]], [[Robin Antin]], [[Keith Richards]], [[Eddie Murphy]] (as his character James "Thunder" Early from the movie ''[[Dreamgirls (film)|Dreamgirls]]''), [[Sherman Hemsley]] (as his character George Jefferson on ''[[The Jeffersons]]''), [[Charles Barkley]], [[Sendhil Ramamurthy]] (as [[Mohinder Suresh]]), [[Tyson Beckford]], [[Seal (musician)|Seal]] (originally played by Jordan Peele until Peele left the show at the end of season 13), [[Sidney Poitier]], [[Lionel Richie]], [[Barack Obama]], [[Kobe Bryant]] and [[Jack Haley]] (as the [[Tin Woodsman|Tin Man]] from ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''). {{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} He also played female celebrities, including [[Phylicia Rashād]] and [[Eva Longoria]] (as [[Gabrielle Solis]] on a ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'' parody). {{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}
