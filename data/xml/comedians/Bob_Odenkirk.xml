'''Robert John Odenkirk''' (born October 22, 1962) is an American actor, comedian, writer, director, and producer. He is best known for his role as smooth-talking lawyer [[Saul Goodman|Saul Goodman/Jimmy McGill]] on the [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] crime drama series ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' and its spin-off ''[[Better Call Saul]]'', and for the [[HBO]] [[sketch comedy]] series ''[[Mr. Show with Bob and David]]'', which he co-created and starred in with fellow comic and friend [[David Cross]].&lt;ref name="modest"/&gt;

From the late 1980s to 1990s, Odenkirk worked as a writer for television shows ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' and ''[[The Ben Stiller Show]]'', winning two Emmys for his work. He also wrote for ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'', ''[[Get a Life (TV series)|Get a Life]]'', and acted in a recurring role as Agent Stevie Grant in ''[[The Larry Sanders Show]]''. In the early 2000s, Odenkirk discovered the comedy duo [[Tim &amp; Eric]] and produced their television series ''[[Tom Goes to the Mayor]]'' and ''[[Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!]]'' He directed three films, ''[[Melvin Goes to Dinner]]'' (2003), ''[[Let's Go to Prison]]'' (2006) and ''[[The Brothers Solomon]]'' (2007). He was also an executive producer of the sketch comedy show ''[[The Birthday Boys (TV series)|The Birthday Boys]]'', developing the show with the comedy group after seeing their work at the [[Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre]] in Los Angeles. In 2015, he and [[David Cross]] reunited, along with the rest of the ''Mr. Show'' cast, for ''[[W/ Bob &amp; David]]'' on Netflix. Odenkirk co-wrote, produced and starred in the [[Netflix]] original film ''[[Girlfriend's Day]]'' which was released in 2017.  

The success of ''Breaking Bad'' and ''Better Call Saul'' led to acting work in high profile projects, such as ''[[Nebraska (film)|Nebraska]]'', directed by [[Alexander Payne]], ''[[The Post (film)|The Post]]'', directed by [[Steven Spielberg]], and Disney/Pixar's ''[[Incredibles 2]]'' written and directed by [[Brad Bird]].

==Early life==
Odenkirk was born in [[Berwyn, Illinois]], then raised in [[Naperville, Illinois|Naperville]]. He is one of seven siblings born to Walter Odenkirk, who was employed in the printing business, and Barbara Odenkirk,&lt;ref name=TCMbio&gt;{{cite web|title=Overview for Bob Odenkirk|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/participant.jsp?spid=144048&amp;apid=0|work=TCM (Turner Classic Movies)|accessdate=November 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roman Catholics of German and Irish descent.&lt;ref name=refchicago&gt;{{Cite news|last=Parsi|first=Novid|title=Bad boy|publisher=Time Out Chicago|date=March 17, 2010|url=http://chicago.timeout.com/articles/tv/83713/bob-odenkirk-interview|accessdate=March 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JewishJournal-NE"&gt;{{cite web|last=Pfefferman|first=Naomi|title=Bob Odenkirk on 'Nebraska' and 'Breaking Bad'|url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/the_ticket/item/bob_odenkirk_on_nebraska_and_breaking_bad|work=Jewish Journal|publisher=Tribe Media Corp|accessdate=November 16, 2013|date=November 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents divorced in part due to Walter's [[alcoholism]], which influenced Bob's decision to [[teetotalism|avoid alcohol]] as much as possible. He would later say that he grew up "hating" Naperville because "it felt like a dead end, like Nowheresville. I couldn't wait to move into a city and be around people who were doing exciting things."&lt;ref name=refchicago/&gt; Walter Odenkirk died of bone cancer in 1995.&lt;ref name=TCMbio/&gt;&lt;ref name="JewishJournal-NE"/&gt;

Odenkirk attended [[Naperville North High School]] and [[Marquette University]] in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], then transferred to [[Southern Illinois University Carbondale|Southern Illinois University]] in [[Carbondale, Illinois]], "honing his sketch-writing and performance skills with live shows on both colleges' radio stations."&lt;ref name=TCMbio/&gt; He began his foray into comedy writing as a radio [[DJ]] for WIDB the local [[college radio|college station]] at [[Southern Illinois University Carbondale|SIU-Carbondale]]. At WIDB he created a late-night (midnight to 4 am) radio comedy show called The Prime Time Special. He worked beside such other fledgling stars like Greg Weindorf and Matt Helser. After three years of college, Odenkirk decided to try writing and improv in Chicago. First studying with [[Del Close]], Odenkirk attended "[[The Players Workshop]] of the Second City" where he met [[Robert Smigel]], and they began a collaboration that would last for years and take Odenkirk to ''Saturday Night Live''.&lt;ref name=refchicago/&gt; He also performed at the [[Improv Olympic]] alongside notable comedians [[Chris Farley]] and [[Tim Meadows]].
 
Odenkirk said his strongest comedic influence was ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'', primarily due to its combination of cerebral and simple humor.&lt;ref name="chi-read"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sacks|first=Mike|title=How I Made It in Comedy: Bob Odenkirk|url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/bob-odenkirk/Content?oid=1141571|work=Chicago Reader|
accessdate=November 16, 2013|location=News + Features|date=July 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other influences included radio personality [[Steve Dahl]], ''[[Second City Television|SCTV]]'', [[Steve Martin]]'s ''[[Let's Get Small]]'', [[Woody Allen]], [[The Credibility Gap]], and [[Bob and Ray]].&lt;ref name="chi-read"/&gt; He visited Chicago's [[The Second City|Second City Theater]] at the age of fourteen. His younger brother is comedy writer [[Bill Odenkirk]].

==Career==

===Work in television===
====''Saturday Night Live'': 1987–1991====
Odenkirk was hired as a writer at ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in 1987 and worked there through 1991. Working alongside [[Robert Smigel]] and [[Conan O'Brien]], he contributed to many sketches they created, but felt uncertain of the efficacy of his own writing at the show.&lt;ref name=garlin&gt;{{cite web|title=Bob Odenkirk Interview|url=https://soundcloud.com/jeffgarlin/bob-odenkirk|work=By the way: In conversation with Jeff Garlin. #20 Bob Odenkirk|accessdate=March 18, 2014|date=October 3, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140318215634/https://soundcloud.com/jeffgarlin/bob-odenkirk|archivedate=March 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He acted in several small roles on the show, most visibly during a 1991 parody commercial for Bad Idea Jeans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/bob-odenkirk-laments-snl-stints-778941|title=Bob Odenkirk Laments 'SNL' Stints: "I Was a Dick" to Lorne Michaels|date=March 3, 2015|website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate=March 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

During his final year at ''SNL'', he worked alongside [[Adam Sandler]], [[David Spade]], [[Chris Rock]] and [[Chris Farley]], but eventually he decided to leave the show in order to pursue performing.&lt;ref name="garlin"/&gt; He has credited ''SNL'' with teaching him many lessons about sketch writing, from senior writers like [[Jim Downey (comedian)|Jim Downey]] and [[Al Franken]], as well as his friends Smigel and O'Brien.&lt;ref name="chi-read"/&gt;

When ''SNL'' took its 1988 summer break, Odenkirk returned to Chicago to perform a stage show with Smigel and O'Brien, titled ''[[Happy Happy Good Show]]''. The following summer he did a one-man show, ''Show-Acting Guy'', directed by Tom Gianas. During his final summer hiatus, he wrote and acted in the Second City Mainstage show, ''Flag Burning Permitted in Lobby Only''. In that particular show, he wrote the character "[[Matt Foley]], Motivational Speaker", for Chris Farley, which would later be reprised on ''SNL''.&lt;ref name="chi-read"/&gt;

====Various writing and acting work: 1991–1994====
In 1991, Odenkirk was hired to write for the TV show ''[[Get a Life (TV series)|Get a Life]]'', which starred ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'' alumnus [[Chris Elliott]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sandberg|first=Bryn Elise|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/bob-odenkirk-better-call-saul-744069|title=Bob Odenkirk on 'Better Call Saul': "It's Total Drama"|date=October 27, 2014|website=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=March 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote for ''[[The Dennis Miller Show]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zara|first=Ignacio|url=http://yareah.com/2015/02/07/better-call-saul-star-bob-odenkirk-ten-things-know/|title='Better Call Saul' Star Bob Odenkirk.

Odenkirk's friendship with [[Ben Stiller]], with whom he briefly shared an office at ''SNL'', would lead to him being hired for the cast of ''[[The Ben Stiller Show]]'' in 1992. Working as both a writer and actor on the show, he created and starred in the memorable sketch "Manson Lassie", and helped the show win an [[Emmy Award]] for writing. However, the show had already been canceled by the time it won the award.&lt;ref name=modest&gt;{{cite web|last=Hubbard|first=Brodie F.|title=Bob Odenkirk Interview|url=http://mpempire.com/?p=1312|work=Modest Proposal: Comedy for Our Target Demographic|accessdate=March 4, 2015|date=February 2004|deadurl=yes|archivedate=July 14, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714122750/http://mpempire.com/?p=1312}}&lt;/ref&gt; Odenkirk served as a writer on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'' for the show's 1993 and 1994 seasons.&lt;ref name=Harp&gt;{{cite web|last=Harp|first=Justin|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/ustv/s247/better-call-saul/feature/a626253/better-call-sauls-bob-odenkirk-key-tv-moments-from-breaking-bad-star.html#~p5VqV5lqhEJoNI|title=Better Call Saul's Bob Odenkirk: Key TV moments from Breaking Bad star|date=February 8, 2015|website=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=March 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Odenkirk met [[David Cross]] at ''Ben Stiller''; shortly afterward, the pair began performing live sketch shows, which eventually evolved into ''Mr. Show with Bob and David''.&lt;ref name=Harp /&gt; In 1993, Odenkirk began a recurring role on ''[[The Larry Sanders Show]]'' as [[Larry Sanders (character)|Larry Sanders]]' agent, Stevie Grant. He would continue the character through 1998.&lt;ref name=Harp/&gt; Also in 1993, he had brief acting roles on ''[[Roseanne (TV show)|Roseanne]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chan|first=Anna|url=http://www.today.com/popculture/roseanne-guest-stars-george-clooney-found-big-stardom-8C11406530|title='Roseanne' guest stars like George Clooney found big stardom|date=October 18, 2013|website=[[Today.com]]|accessdate=March 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tom Arnold (actor)|Tom Arnold]]'s ''[[The Jackie Thomas Show]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywood.com/tv/55482092/the-jackie-thomas-show|title=The Jackie Thomas Show: Credits|website=[[Hollywood.com]]|accessdate=March 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Mr. Show'': 1995–1998====
{{main article|Mr. Show}}
Created by Odenkirk and [[David Cross]], ''Mr. Show'' ran on [[HBO]] for four seasons. The series featured a number of comedians in the early stages of their careers, including [[Sarah Silverman]], [[Paul F. Tompkins]], [[Jack Black]], [[Tom Kenny]], [[Mary Lynn Rajskub]], [[Brian Posehn]] and [[Scott Aukerman]]. While nominated for multiple Emmy awards in writing and generally well liked by critics, it never broke out of a "cult" audience into larger mainstream acceptance due to being a premium cable show. After ''Mr. Show'', Bob and David and the writers from the staff wrote the movie ''[[Run, Ronnie, Run]]''. The film was an extension of a sketch from the first season of the show. However, the studio took production control away from Cross and Odenkirk during the editing stages, and the pair disowned the final product. {{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

====After ''Mr. Show'': 1999–2008====
[[File:BobOdenKirk1SecondFilm.jpg|right|thumb|Odenkirk holding a producer credit for ''[[The 1 Second Film]]'' in January 2005]]
Odenkirk starred in numerous television shows and some films.

In 2004, Odenkirk received an unsolicited package including the work of [[Tim Heidecker]] and [[Eric Wareheim]]. Inspired by their unique voice, he connected with them and helped them develop a semi-animated show for [[Adult Swim]] called ''[[Tom Goes to the Mayor]]''. He assisted Tim and Eric with the development of their second series, ''[[Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job]]''.
