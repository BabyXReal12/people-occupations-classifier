'''Robert Michael Schneider''' (born October 31, 1963) is an American actor, comedian, screenwriter, and director. A stand-up comic and veteran of the [[NBC]] sketch comedy series ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', he went on to a career in feature films, including starring roles in the comedy films ''[[Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo]]'', ''[[The Hot Chick]]'', ''[[The Benchwarmers]]'', and ''[[Grown Ups (film)|Grown Ups]]''.

== Early life ==
Schneider was born in [[San Francisco]], California, and grew up in the nearby suburb of [[Pacifica, California|Pacifica]]. His parents are Pilar (née Monroe), a former kindergarten teacher and ex-school board president, and Marvin Schneider, a real estate broker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.filmreference.com/film/92/Rob-Schneider.html|title=Rob Schneider Biography (1963–)|publisher=filmreference.com|accessdate=September 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was [[Jews|Jewish]] and his mother was [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]].&lt;ref name="ref0992"&gt;{{cite news|last=Shister|first=Gail|title=SCHNEIDER GETS NO TIME OFF FOR GOOD BEHAVIOR|pages=|publisher=Chicago Tribune|date=August 5, 1996|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1996-08-05/features/9608050114_1_filter-rob-schneider-jewish|accessdate=October 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schneider's maternal grandmother was a [[Filipino people|Filipina]] who met and married his grandfather, a white American army private, while he was stationed in the [[Philippines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pfefferman|first=Naomi|url=http://www.interfaithfamily.com/arts_and_entertainment/popular_culture/A_Conversation_with_Rob_Schneider.shtml|title=InterfaithFamily.com |publisher=InterfaithFamily.com |date= |accessdate=October 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ref099"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gray Streeter|first=Leslie|title=HOW ROB SCHNEIDER BECAME THE HOT CHICK|pages=|publisher=Palm Beach Post|date=December 11, 2002|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=PBPB&amp;p_theme=pbpb&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0F8203ABA58EFD21&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|accessdate=October 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mixed background is a common theme in his comedy acts. His older brother, [[John Schneider (producer)|John]], is a producer. Schneider graduated from [[Terra Nova High School (Pacifica)|Terra Nova High School]] in 1982 and then attended [[San Francisco State University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://archives.sfweekly.com/exhibitionist/2015/06/02/rob-schneider-gets-real |title=Rob Schneider Gets Real |last=Rotter |first=Joshua |date=2 June 2015 |website=SF Weekly |access-date=30 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==

=== Early career ===
{{BLP sources section|date=June 2008}}
Schneider started his stand-up comedy career while still in high school, opening for San Francisco favorites [[Head On (band)|Head On]], a band managed by his older brother [[John Schneider (producer)|John]]. After high school, he played Bay Area nightclubs such as the [[Holy City Zoo]] and The Other Cafe, and was a regular guest on local radio programs. After opening a show by comedian [[Dennis Miller]] in 1987, Schneider won a slot on [[HBO]]'s 13th Annual Young Comedians special, which was hosted by Miller. Schneider's appearance on the HBO special led to a position as a writer for the late night [[NBC]] [[sketch comedy]] series ''Saturday Night Live''.

=== ''Saturday Night Live'' ===
Schneider was hired at ''Saturday Night Live'' in 1988. Schneider swiftly graduated from writer and featured player to full cast member.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} [[History of SNL:1990-1995|From 1990 to 1994 at ''SNL'']], he played such roles as "Tiny Elvis" and "Orgasm Guy". His best known recurring character{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} was Richard Laymer, an office worker whose desk was stuck beside the photocopier, and who addressed each of his fellow employees with an endless stream of annoying nicknames. Schneider is featured in the video release ''The Bad Boys of Saturday Night Live'', along with colleagues [[Adam Sandler]], [[Chris Rock]], [[David Spade]], and [[Chris Farley]].

=== Feature films, sitcoms, and endorsements ===
After leaving ''SNL'', Schneider played supporting roles in a series of movies including ''[[Surf Ninjas]]'', ''[[Judge Dredd (film)|Judge Dredd]]'', ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies (1993 film)|The Beverly Hillbillies]]'', ''[[Demolition Man (film)|Demolition Man]]'', and ''[[Down Periscope]]''. He also appeared in a recurring part on the TV series ''[[Coach (TV series)|Coach]]''. In 1996, he co-starred in the [[NBC]] sit-com ''[[Men Behaving Badly (U.S. TV series)|Men Behaving Badly]]'', an American take on the hit British series of the same name. The U.S. version ran for two seasons.

Schneider starred in the 1999 feature film ''[[Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo]]'', a tale of a fish-tank cleaner who incurs a massive debt and is forced to become a "man-whore." This was followed by ''[[The Animal]]'', about a man given animal powers by a mad scientist; ''[[The Hot Chick]]'', wherein the mind of a petty thief played by Schneider is mystically switched into the body of a pretty, but mean-spirited high school cheerleader ([[Rachel McAdams]]); and the sequel ''[[Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo]]''. The latter movie was not well received by critics or moviegoers, and as a result, Schneider won a [[2005 Golden Raspberry Awards|2005 Worst Actor Razzie Award]] for his role in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|1705|section=awards}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Schneider co-starred in the baseball-themed family comedy ''[[The Benchwarmers]]'', along with his fellow ''SNL'' alumnus [[David Spade]] as well as [[Jon Heder]]. Other film roles include Schneider's appearance with [[The Muppets|Jim Henson's Muppets]] in the 1999 film ''[[Muppets from Space]]'', and his role as a San Francisco hobo in the 2004 remake of ''[[Around the World in 80 Days (2004 film)|Around the World in 80 Days]]''.

Schneider's directorial debut, the comedy ''[[Big Stan]]'', was released in some overseas markets during the fall of 2008, with a U.S. release in early 2009. In the film, he starred as a con artist who is arrested for perpetrating real-estate scams. He is sentenced to prison, so he takes a crash-course in martial arts to survive incarceration.

Schneider has also appeared in numerous comedies starring his ''SNL'' comrade [[Adam Sandler]], most recently in 2010's ''[[Grown Ups (film)|Grown Ups]]''. The comedic characters Schneider plays in these films include an overly enthusiastic [[Cajun]] man who proclaims the catch-phrase, "You can do it!"; an amiable Middle Eastern delivery boy; a prison inmate; and Sandler's one-eyed Hawaiian sidekick, Ula. Schneider has uttered the line "You can do it!" as a running gag in Sandler's films ''[[The Waterboy]]'', ''[[Little Nicky]]'', ''[[50 First Dates]]'', ''[[The Longest Yard (2005 film)|The Longest Yard]]'', and ''[[Bedtime Stories (film)|Bedtime Stories]]'', as well as in a deleted scene from ''[[Click (2006 film)|Click]]''. (A sample of Schneider saying the phrase also turns up in the song "[[Original Prankster]]" by [[The Offspring]].) Returning the favor, Sandler appeared in a cameo to spout the same line in Schneider's ''[[The Animal]]'', wherein, as a reference, Adam Sandler utters: "Yeah! You can do it!" Sandler also showed up briefly in Schneider's ''[[The Hot Chick]]''. Schneider narrated Sandler's 2002 animated movie ''[[Eight Crazy Nights]]'', and voiced the part of a Chinese waiter. Schneider also had an uncredited cameo as a Canadian-Japanese wedding-chapel minister in the 2007 Sandler-[[Kevin James]] comedy ''[[I Now Pronounce You Chuck &amp; Larry]]'', and played a [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] cab driver who serves as the title character's nemesis in the 2008 Sandler film ''[[You Don't Mess with the Zohan]]''.

Schneider played a variety of roles in the 2005 TV special ''Back to Norm'', starring another former ''SNL'' player [[Norm Macdonald]], and appeared on episodes of the popular TV shows ''[[Seinfeld]]'' and ''[[Ally McBeal]]''. Schneider hosted the ''Sports Illustrated: Swimsuit '97'' TV special, and the 2005 ''[[Teen Choice Awards]]'', and was a frequent guest on NBC's late-night variety program ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]''. In Schneider's appearance with Leno on the July 24, 2007 episode of ''The Tonight Show,'' he showed up in drag as actress [[Lindsay Lohan]] after the latter cancelled following a controversial arrest for [[driving under the influence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.com/celebrity/rob-schneider-in-drag-fills-in-for-lindsay-lohan-on-tonight-show/|title=Rob Schneider (in Drag) Fills in for Lindsay Lohan on Tonight Show|author=|date=|website=people.com|accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides his efforts in movies and television, Schneider released his first comedy album ''[[Registered Offender (comedy album)|Registered Offender]]'' in July 2010. ''Registered Offender'' is composed of audio sketches and songs, with Schneider himself doing all of the character voices on the recording. He also revived his stand-up comedy career in 2010 with an international tour of theaters, clubs, and casinos.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Schneider appeared in the music video for country singer [[Neal McCoy]]'s "[[Billy's Got His Beer Goggles On]]", as the song's title character. McCoy and Schneider met while the two went on a [[USO]] tour in support of U.S. troops two months after the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks]] on the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] and [[the Pentagon]].

Schneider starred as the title character in the CBS-TV situation comedy ''[[Rob (TV series)|Rob]]'', which was loosely based on his real life. The series was canceled by CBS in May 2012.  In 2015, he produced, directed and starred in ''[[Real Rob]]'', a sitcom that follows his life and includes his real-life wife Patricia and daughter Miranda. [[Netflix]] released a season of 8 episodes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hipes |first=Patrick |url=http://deadline.com/2015/11/real-rob-trailer-rob-schneider-netflix-comedy-series-1201631754/ |title=[VIDEO&amp;#93; 'Real Rob' Trailer: Rob Schneider Goes All Hollywood On Netflix |publisher=Deadline |date=November 20, 2015 |accessdate=December 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/rob-schneider-netflix-tv-series-real-rob-827928 |title='Real Rob': Rob Schneider's Comedy Series Coming to Netflix |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=September 29, 2015 |accessdate=December 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a second season in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2016/07/netflix-chelsea-lady-dynamite-real-rob-renewed-season-2-1201793406/|title=Netflix Renews 'Chelsea', 'Lady Dynamite' &amp; 'Real Rob' For Season 2 -TCA|date=27 July 2016|work=Deadline|accessdate=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ew.com/tv/2017/08/23/new-to-netflix-september-2017/|title=New to Netflix in September: 'Pulp Fiction', 'Jerry Before Seinfeld' and More|date=2017-08-23|work=EW.com|access-date=2017-08-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schneider is the official celebrity spokesperson for the Taiwan Tourism Bureau and the [[Ten Ren Tea|Ten Ren Tea company]] in [[Taipei]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aedu/201402110053.aspx|title=Rob Schneider honored for helping boost travel to Taiwan|work=focustaiwan.tw}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schneider was spokesperson for [[State Farm]] Insurance, but was dropped in 2014 due to his [[Rob Schneider#Anti-vaccination activism|anti-vaccination views]].&lt;ref name="hollywood reporter"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/how-vaccines-autism-battle-continues-despite-scientific-consensus-924080 |title=How Hollywood Stars, Trump and Scientologists Inflame the Vaccine Wars: "It's Spurious but Effective" |last=Baum |first=Gary |date=August 31, 2016 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |access-date=February 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = LAT&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/showtracker/la-et-st-rob-schneider-state-farm-antivaccine-views-20140925-story.html |title=State Farm dumps pitchman Rob Schneider over anti-vaccine views |last=Blake |first=Meredith |date=September 25, 2014 |website=[[Los Angeles Times]] |access-date=February 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2016, Schneider was featured as a special guest on the [[Let's Play (gaming)|Let's Play]] [[webseries]] ''[[Game Grumps]]'', alongside his wife Patricia, commentating over [[Midway Games|Midway]]'s ''[[Mortal Kombat Trilogy]]''. They reappeared on the show in November 2017, then commentating over [[Konami]]'s ''[[Contra (video game)|Contra]]''.

===Controversies===

In a January 2005 Oscar preview, movie reviewer [[Patrick Goldstein]] commented that that year's [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] nominees were "ignored, unloved and turned down flat by most of the same studios that ... bankroll hundreds of sequels, including a follow-up to ''[[Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo]]'', a film that was sadly overlooked at Oscar time because apparently nobody had the foresight to invent a category for Best Running Penis Joke Delivered by a Third-Rate Comic."&lt;ref name=lat-2005jan26&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/jan/26/entertainment/et-oscarpicture26 |title=This Year, the Safe Bets Are Off |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=January 26, 2005 |first=Patrick |last=Goldstein}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Schneider&gt;{{cite news |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20050811%2FREVIEWS%2F50725001%2F1023&amp;AID1=%2F20050811%2FREVIEWS%2F50725001%2F1023&amp;AID2= |title=Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo |date=August 11, 2005 |newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |first=Roger |last=Ebert |authorlink=Roger Ebert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schneider retaliated by placing an ad in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' two weeks later, commenting that Goldstein was unqualified to opine this because he had never won the [[Pulitzer Prize]], or any other journalistic award, because, he remarked, "they haven't invented a category for Best Third-Rate, Unfunny Pompous Reporter Who's Never Been Acknowledged by His Peers." [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' intervened by saying that, "Schneider can dish it out, but he can't take it." Then responded, "He's not so good at dishing it out either." Ebert went on to point out on his site that Goldstein won a National Headliner Award, a Los Angeles Press Club Award, a RockCritics.com award, and the Publicists' Guild award for lifetime achievement.&lt;ref name=Schneider/&gt; Schneider later publicly admitted that he later found out that Goldstein won the Lifetime Achievement Publicist Guild Award and apologized. He then remarked, "My only regret is that he (Goldstein) got a little famous out of it."

== Personal life ==
Schneider has a daughter with former model London King, musician [[Elle King]], who was born in 1989.&lt;ref name=daughter&gt;{{cite news|last1=Condran|first1=Ed|title=Elle King to bring fiery blues attitude to Philadelphia|url=http://www.mcall.com/entertainment/music/mc-elle-king-union-transfer-philadelphia-20151127-story.html|accessdate=December 19, 2015|publisher=The Morning Call|date=November 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=DeVille|first1=Chris|title=Elle King Is Swaggering Out Of Her Father's Shadow|url=http://www.stereogum.com/1847876/elle-king-is-swaggering-out-of-her-fathers-shadow/franchises/the-week-in-pop/|accessdate=December 19, 2015|publisher=Stereogum|date=December 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, Schneider established the Rob Schneider Music Foundation. The foundation returned music education to [[Pacifica, California|Pacifica]]'s elementary schools by paying the teachers' salaries and providing funds for instruments and other equipment. Prior to Schneider's efforts, the school system did not have music education programs for many years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.robschneidermusicfoundation.org/about.php |title=RSMF - About |publisher=Robschneidermusicfoundation.org |date= |accessdate=October 4, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130408022408/http://www.robschneidermusicfoundation.org/about.php |archive-date=April 8, 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schneider once co-owned the [[DNA Lounge]], a [[San Francisco]] nightclub.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DNA Lounge: Ancient History: 1906–1998|date=December 13, 2000|url= http://www.dnalounge.com/backstage/log/1906-1998.html#1994|accessdate=February 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 23, 2011, Schneider married television producer Patricia Azarcoya Arce, in [[Beverly Hills, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=PEP.ph |url=http://www.pep.ph/news/29229/rob-schneider-marries-for-the-third-time |title=Rob Schneider marries for the third time &amp;#124; PEP.ph: The Number One Site for Philippine Showbiz |publisher=PEP.ph |date=April 4, 2013 |accessdate=April 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rob Schneider is married!|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20484741,00.html|author=People Magazine Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their first child, Miranda Scarlett Schneider, was born in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=11.19.12 Print |url=http://www.toofab.com/2012/11/19/rob-schneider-and-patricia-azarcoya-schneider-welcome-baby-daughter/ |title=Exclusive Details: Rob Schneider and Wife Welcome Baby! |publisher=Toofab.com |date=November 19, 2012 |accessdate=April 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple welcomed their second daughter, Madeline Robbie Schneider, in September 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Juneau, Jen and Elizabeth Leonard|url=http://celebritybabies.people.com/2016/09/14/rob-schneider-welcomes-daughter-madeline-robbie/|title=Rob Schneider Welcomes Daughter Madeline Robbie|publisher=''People.com''|date=September 14, 2016|accessdate=September 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family supports Mexican soccer club [[Tigres UANL|Tigres]], which is based in Patricia's hometown of [[Monterrey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en-us/news/114/mexico/2015/12/10/18232022/rob-schneider-cheers-on-tigres-at-el-volcan|title=Rob Schneider cheers on Tigres at El Volcan {{!}} Goal.com|website=www.goal.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://wearemitu.com/mitu-world/heres-why-rob-schneider-loves-mexican-soccer-so-much/|title=Here's Why Rob Schneider Loves Mexican Soccer So Much|last=Inc.|first=mitú,|date=2015-12-14|access-date=2017-12-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anti-vaccination activism==
Schneider has been an outspoken critic of [[Vaccination#Vaccination-autism controversy|childhood vaccinations]], promoting the [[MMR vaccine controversy|refuted claim]] that they are dangerous and cause [[autism]], which is contrary to the [[scientific consensus]] on the subject.&lt;ref name="hollywood reporter"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/straight-talk-about-vaccination/|title=Straight Talk about Vaccination|first1=Matthew F.|last1=Daley|first2=Jason M.|last2=Glanz|date=September 1, 2011|work=[[Scientific American]]|volume=305|issue=3|pages=32–34|accessdate=February 21, 2017|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0911-32}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with [[News10]] in Sacramento, Schneider opined that "The efficacy of these shots have not been proven ... And the toxicity of these things — we're having more and more side effects. We're having more and more autism." He also views the actions from the state to mandate vaccinations as government overreach: "It's illegal. You can't make people do procedures that they don't want. The parents have to be the ones who make the decisions for what's best for our kids. It can't be the government saying that. It's against the Nuremberg Laws."&lt;ref name="HPo"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/01/rob-schneider-links-autism-vaccines_n_1641922.html |title=Rob Schneider Links Autism To Vaccines, Rails Against Big Government (VIDEO) |last=Hart |first=Benjamin |date=July 1, 2012 |website=[[The Huffington Post]] |access-date=February 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schneider's statements have been discredited as lacking any factual basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://time.com/3430107/rob-schneider-state-farm-vaccines/|title=Dear Rob Schneider: Please Shut Up About Vaccines|first=Jeffrey|last=Kluger|date=September 25, 2014|work=[[Time.com]]|accessdate=February 21, 2017|quote=It's actually worth watching the entire jaw-dropping display, because Schneider somehow manages to thread the extraordinary needle of being wrong on every single point he makes.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schneider has passionately fought the passage of two California laws, California Assembly Bill 2109 and [[California Senate Bill 277]], which both intended to make childhood vaccination exemptions harder to obtain. On September 28, 2012, Schneider and California State Assemblyman [[Tim Donnelly (politician)|Tim Donnelly]] spoke at the "Medical Freedom Rally", where they urged California Governor [[Jerry Brown]] to veto Assembly Bill 2109, which would have made it more difficult for parents to utilize philosophical reasons for exemptions from mandatory childhood vaccinations. While the bill was not vetoed, Governor Brown added a signing message instructing the [[Health department|Department of Health]] to add a [[Vaccination and religion#Exemptions|religious exemption]] and to make sure the process is not overly burdensome to parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AV media |url=https://vimeo.com/60227438 |title=Rob Schneider and Tim Donnelly |last=Medical Freedom |date=February 21, 2012 |via=Vimeo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://gov.ca.gov/docs/AB_2109_Signing_Message.pdf | format=PDF | title=AB2109 signing message | first=Jerry | last=Brown | authorlink=Jerry Brown | date=September 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.sacbee.com/capitolalertlatest/2012/09/am-alert-rob-schneider-tim-donnelly-team-up-on-vaccinations.html |title=AM Alert: Rob Schneider, Tim Donnelly Team Up On Vaccinations |last=Massimino |first=Micaela |date=September 28, 2012 |website=[[The Sacramento Bee]]  – Capitol Alert |access-date=February 20, 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160529003350/http://blogs.sacbee.com/capitolalertlatest/2012/09/am-alert-rob-schneider-tim-donnelly-team-up-on-vaccinations.html |archivedate=May 29, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Schneider fought against [[California Senate Bill 277]], which removed exemptions to mandatory vaccinations due to personal beliefs, even leaving a phone message to California state Assemblywoman and bill co-author [[Lorena Gonzalez]] saying that he would spend money against her in her next re-election. Gonzalez, in an interview with ''[[The Washington Times]]'', said that she found the message to be disturbing, but upon calling back, she said "he was actually much nicer to me, but let's be honest … that is 20 mins of my life I'll never get back arguing that vaccines don't cause autism with Deuce Bigalow, male gigolo. #vaccinateyourkids."&lt;ref name="WT"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/feb/15/rob-schneider-anti-vaccine-actor-leaves-disturbing/ |title=Rob Schneider, anti-vaccine actor, leaves 'disturbing message' for lawmaker |last=Chasmar |first=Jessica |date=February 15, 2015 |website=[[The Washington Times]] |access-date=February 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political views==
In 2013, Schneider switched political parties from the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] to the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], explaining: "The state of California is a mess, and the super majority of Democrats is not working. I've been a lifelong Democrat and I have to switch over because it no longer serves the people of this great state."&lt;ref name="Chumley"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chumley|first1=Cheryl K.|title=Hollywood star Rob Schneider turns Republican, citing Democratic 'disaster'|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/oct/1/hollywood-star-turns-republican-citing-democratic-/|accessdate=November 20, 2016|publisher=Washington Times|date=October 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That same year, Schneider endorsed [[California State Assembly|Assemblyman]] [[Tim Donnelly (politician)|Tim Donnelly]] for Governor in the [[California gubernatorial election, 2014|election the following year]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://freebeacon.com/politics/rob-schneider-endorses-republican-tim-donnelly-for-governor-of-california/]&lt;/ref&gt;
