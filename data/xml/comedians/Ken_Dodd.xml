'''Sir Kenneth Arthur Dodd''' {{Post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|OBE}} (8 November 1927 – 11 March 2018) was an English [[stand-up comedy|comedian]], singer and occasional actor.  He was described as "the last great [[music hall]] entertainer", and was primarily known for his live [[stand-up comedy|stand-up]] performances.

A lifelong resident of [[Knotty Ash]] in [[Liverpool]], Dodd's career as an entertainer started in the mid-1950s.  His performances included rapid and incessant delivery of often surreal jokes, and would run for several hours, frequently past midnight.  His verbal and physical comedy was supplemented by his red, white and blue "[[Feather duster|tickling stick]]" [[Theatrical property|prop]], and often introduced by his characteristic upbeat greeting of "How tickled I am!"   He interspersed the comedy with songs, both serious and humorous, and with his original speciality, [[ventriloquism]].  He also had several hit singles primarily as a ballad singer in the 1960s, and occasionally appeared in dramatic roles.  He performed on radio and television, and popularised the characters of the [[Diddy Men]].
 	
He was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in the [[2017 New Year Honours]] for services to entertainment and charity.  His stage career lasted for over 60 years, and he continued to perform, when his health permitted, until his death at the age of 90.

==Early life==
Kenneth Arthur Dodd was born on 8 November 1927 in a former farmhouse in [[Knotty Ash]], a suburb of [[Liverpool]], to Arthur Dodd and Sarah (née Gray);&lt;ref name="MT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2018/03/12/sir-ken-dodd-age-jokes-diddy-men-wife-anne-jones-house-knotty-ash-7380502/|title=Sir Ken Dodd age, jokes, Diddy Men, wife Anne Jones and house in Knotty Ash|publisher=Metro UK|date=12 March 2018|author=Duncan, Amy}}&lt;/ref&gt; where his parents lived. He had an older brother, William and a younger sister, June.&lt;ref name="MT"/&gt; He went to the Knotty Ash School, and sang in the local church choir of [[St John the Evangelist, Knotty Ash|St John's Church, Knotty Ash]].  He was to live in Knotty Ash all his life, dying in the house in which he was born, and often referred to the area&amp;mdash;as well as its mythical "[[sandwich|jam butty]] mines" and "[[black pudding]] plantations"&amp;mdash;in his act.&lt;ref name=bale/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://metro.co.uk/2018/03/12/knotty-ash-location-ken-dodds-house-90-years-7380179/|title=Where is Knotty Ash – the location of Ken Dodd’s house for 90 years|work=Metro|date=12 March 2018|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He then attended [[Childwall Academy|Holt High School]], a [[Grammar schools in the United Kingdom|grammar school]] in [[Childwall]], Liverpool, but left at the age of 14 to work for his father, a coal merchant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://life.spectator.co.uk/2018/03/ken-dodd-a-comic-genius-who-inspired-true-devotion/|title=Ken Dodd: a comic genius who inspired true devotion|publisher=Spectator Life|date=12 March 2018|author=Cook, William}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ken Dodd Story"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chucklebutty.co.uk/doddbio.html|title=The Ken Dodd Story|accessdate=20 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around this time he became interested in [[showbusiness|show business]] after seeing an advert in a [[British comics|comic]]: "Fool your teachers, amaze your friends—send [[Sixpence (British coin)|6d]] in stamps and become a ventriloquist!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comedy/comedians/ken-dodd-12-funny-moments-defined-rib-tickling-career/|title=Sir Ken Dodd: the 12 funny moments that defined his rib-tickling career|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=12 March 2018|accessdate=12 March 2018}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sending off for the book. Not long after, his father bought him a ventriloquist's dummy and Ken called it Charlie Brown. He started entertaining at the local orphanage, then at various other local community functions. His distinctive bucked teeth were the result of a cycling accident after a group of school friends dared him to ride a bicycle with his eyes closed.&lt;ref name=bale&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.pressreader.com/uk/evergreen/20171122/283927408075441|title=Sir Ken Dodd at 90|work=Evergreen|first=Bernard|last=Bale|date=22 November 2017|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aged 18, he began working as a travelling salesman, and used his work van to travel to comedy clubs in the evenings.&lt;ref name=stage/&gt;  

==Early career==

[[File:Ken Dodd with a glass of milk, circa 1959.jpg|thumb|Ken Dodd with a glass of milk, circa 1959.]]

He gained his big break at age 26 when, in September 1954, he made his professional show-business debut as Professor Yaffle Chucklebutty, Operatic Tenor and Sausage Knotter at the [[Nottingham]] Empire. He later said, "Well at least they didn't boo me off".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/nottingham/content/articles/2005/01/14/entertainment_theatre_and_dance_features_amazing_facts_about_ken_dodd_feature.shtml |title= Ken Dodd: Twenty things you never knew |work= [[BBC Online]] |date= 6 July 2005 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071228182556/http://www.bbc.co.uk/nottingham/content/articles/2005/01/14/entertainment_theatre_and_dance_features_amazing_facts_about_ken_dodd_feature.shtml |archivedate= 28 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbcobit&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-13360811|title=Obituary: Ken Dodd|work=BBC News|date=12 March 2018|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to tour variety theatres up and down the UK, and in 1955 he appeared at [[Blackpool]], where, in the following year, he had a part in ''Let's Have Fun''. His performance at the [[Central Pier, Blackpool|Central Pier]] was part of a comedy revue with [[Jimmy James (comedian)|Jimmy James]] and Company. Also on the same bill were [[Jimmy Clitheroe]] and [[Roy Castle]].&lt;ref&gt;Theatre Programme, Central Pier, Blackpool, 1956. Cyril Critchlow Collection, Blackpool Central Library, Vol. 38 p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Dodd first gained top billing at Blackpool in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.blackpoolgazette.co.uk/whats-on/tv-and-film/looking-back-at-ken-dodd-s-love-of-blackpool-1-9058544|title=Looking back at Ken Dodd's love of Blackpool|newspaper=Blackpool Gazette|date=12 March 2018|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comedy==
[[File:Ken Dodd, Civic Hall, Ellesmere Port (January 2006).jpg|right|thumb|upright|Dodd at the Civic Hall, [[Ellesmere Port]], 2006. [[Stand-up comedy|Stand-up]] theatre work was the mainstay of his career.]]
Dodd was described as "the last great [[music hall]] entertainer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Arise, Sir Ken | work = The Daily Telegraph | publisher = Telegraph Media Group | date = 31 December 2016 | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comedy/comedians/ken-dodd-retire-at-88-never | accessdate = 9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His [[stand-up comedy]] style was fast and relied on the rapid delivery of [[one-liner joke]]s. He said that his comic influences included other Liverpool comedians like [[Arthur Askey]], [[Robb Wilton]], [[Tommy Handley]] and the "cheeky chappy" from [[Brighton]], [[Max Miller (comedian)|Max Miller]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2008/04/02/6598/the_men_who_tickled_me...|title=The men who tickled me...|publisher=Chortle.co.uk|date=2 April 2008|accessdate=2 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He interspersed the comedy with occasional songs, both serious and humorous, in an incongruously fine light baritone voice, and with his original speciality, ventriloquism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Ken Dodd | website = chortle.co.uk | publisher = Chortle | url = http://www.chortle.co.uk/comics/k/227/ken_dodd | accessdate = 9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of his stage act featured the Diddy Men ("diddy" being local slang for "small"). At first an unseen joke conceived as part of Dodd's imagination, they later appeared on stage, usually played by children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://metro.co.uk/2018/03/12/ken-dodds-diddy-men-7379944/?ito=cbshare|title=Who were Ken Dodd's Diddy Men|newspaper=Metro|date=12 March 2018|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dodd worked mainly as a solo comedian, including in a number of eponymous television and radio shows and made several appearances on BBC TV's music hall revival show, ''[[The Good Old Days (UK TV series)|The Good Old Days]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06rhv2r/episodes/guide|title=The Good Old Days|publisher=BBC|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he enjoyed making people laugh, he was also a serious student of comedy and history, and was interested in [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Henri Bergson]]'s analysis of humour.&lt;ref name=stage&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestage.co.uk/features/obituaries/2018/obituary-liverpool-comedian-ken-dodd/|title=Obituary: Liverpool comedian Ken Dodd|work=The Stage|date=12 March 2018|accessdate=13 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally, he appeared in dramatic roles, including [[Malvolio]] in [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Twelfth Night]]'' on stage in [[Liverpool]] in 1971; on television in the cameo role of 'The Tollmaster' in the 1987 ''[[Doctor Who]]'' story ''[[Delta and the Bannermen]]''; as Yorick (in silent flashback) in [[Kenneth Branagh]]'s [[Hamlet (1996 film)|film version]] of Shakespeare's ''[[Hamlet]]'' in 1996; and as Mr. [[Mouse (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Mouse]] in the 1999 television movie adaptation of ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1999 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]''.&lt;ref name=tickled/&gt;

Dodd was renowned for the length of his performances, and during the 1960s he earned a place in the ''[[Guinness Book of Records]]'' for the world's longest ever joke-telling session: 1,500 jokes in three-and-a-half hours (7.14 jokes per minute), undertaken at the [[Royal Court Theatre, Liverpool]], where audiences entered the show in shifts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2010/jul/22/top-10-record-breaking-comedians|title=Dedication's what you need: top 10 record-breaking comedians|newspaper=The Guardian|date=22 July 2010|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dodd appeared in many [[Royal Variety Performance]]s. The last was in 2006, in front of [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]] and his wife [[Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall|Camilla]], at the [[London Coliseum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2006/12_december/05/variety.shtml|title=Jonathan Ross hosts Royal Variety Performance|publisher=BBC Press Office|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dodd toured frequently throughout his professional career, performing lengthy shows into his eighties, that often did not finish until after midnight.  In his final year, he continued to tour the UK extensively, with his comedy, music and variety show. His final performance was on 28 December 2017 at the ''Echo Arena Auditorium'' in Liverpool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/mar/12/comedy-legend-sir-ken-dodd-dies-aged-90|title=Sir Ken Dodd, legend of comedy, dies aged 90|first1=Kevin|last1=Rawlinson|first2=Frances|last2=Perraudin|date=12 March 2018|website=the Guardian|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said the secret of his success was simply, "I love what I do".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comedy/comedians/ken-dodd-retire-at-88-never/|title=Ken Dodd on the art of making people happy: 'My secret?

== Music ==
Dodd had many hit records, charting on 18 occasions in the [[UK Top 40]], including his first single "Love Is Like a Violin" (1960), produced on [[Decca Records]] by [[Alex Wharton]], which charted at number 8 (UK).  His version of [[Bill Anderson (singer)|Bill Anderson]]'s song "[[Happiness (Bill Anderson song)|Happiness]]" charted in 1964 and became Dodd's signature song.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/herefordandworcester/content/articles/2006/06/20/ken_dodd_1507_event_feature.shtml  "Ken Dodd Happiness Show", ''BBC Hereford &amp; Worcester'', 2006]. Retrieved 12 March 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Dodd's recording of  "[[Tears (Ken Dodd song)|Tears]]" on the [[Columbia Graphophone Company|Columbia]] label topped the [[UK singles chart]] for five weeks in 1965,&lt;ref name="betts"&gt;{{cite book| first= Graham| last= Betts| year=2004| title= Complete UK Hit Singles 1952–2004| edition= 1st|publisher= Collins| location= London| isbn= 0-00-717931-6| page=228}}&lt;/ref&gt;  becoming the biggest hit single in Britain that year and selling over a million copies in the UK alone.  The recording is the third best selling song of the 1960s in Britain;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/music-news/7791739/Ken-Dodd-outsold-only-by-The-Beatles.html|title=Ken Dodd: outsold only by The Beatles|date=1 June 2010|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=12 March 2018|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;  at the time it was the UK's biggest selling single by a solo artist,&lt;ref name="British Hit Singles &amp; Albums"&gt;{{cite book

Dodd had two further UK top ten records: "The River (Le Colline Sono In Fioro)", written by [[Renato Angiolini]] with lyrics by [[Mort Shuman]] (number 3, 1965); and "Promises", written by [[Norman Newell]] and [[Tom Springfield]] (number 6, 1966).&lt;ref name="betts"/&gt;  As well as his successful chart career as a ballad singer, Dodd occasionally released comedy [[novelty record]]s, including the 1965 [[Extended play|EP]] ''Doddy and the Diddy Men'', featuring the song "Where's Me Shirt?" which Dodd co-wrote.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.45cat.com/record/seg8466 "Doddy and the Diddy Men", ''45cat.com'']. Retrieved 12 March 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, his fame in the UK was such that he rivalled [[the Beatles]] as a household name, and his records have sold millions worldwide.&lt;ref name=tickled&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01phj0c |title=BBC Radio 2 – Ken Dodd: How Tickled I've Been |publisher=BBC |date=1 January 2013 |accessdate=25 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tax evasion court case==
In 1989, Dodd was charged with [[tax evasion]]. The subsequent trial, with the prosecution case led by [[Brian Leveson]] QC, produced several revelations. The [[Diddy Men]], who had appeared in his stage act, were often played by local children from stage schools, and were revealed never to have been paid. Dodd was also revealed to have very little money in his bank account, having £336,000 in cash stashed in suitcases in his attic. When asked by the judge, "What does £100,000 in a suitcase feel like?", Dodd replied, "The notes are very light, M'Lord."&lt;ref name="men"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/entertainment/comedy/s/234/234894_dodds_bolton_bonus.html | work=Manchester Evening News | date=1 February 2007 | title=Dodd's Bolton bonus | first=Natalie |last=Anglesey}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also said: "I am not mean, but I am nervous of money, nervous of having it, nervous of not having it" and described money as "important only because I have nothing else".&lt;ref name="independentie"/&gt;

Dodd was represented by [[George Carman]] QC, who in court famously quipped, "Some accountants are comedians, but comedians are never accountants".&lt;ref name="bbcgc"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1097749.stm | title=George Carman: The Bar's 'silver fox' | publisher=BBC News | date=2 January 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He described Dodd as "a fantasist stamped with lifelong eccentricities."&lt;ref name="independentie"/&gt;  The trial lasted three weeks; Dodd was acquitted.&lt;ref name="bbcgc" /&gt;

Despite the strain of the trial, Dodd immediately capitalised on his new-found notoriety with a successful season running from [[Easter]] to [[Christmas]] 1990 at the [[London Palladium]]. It was there he had previously broken the house record for the longest comedy season at the theatre, in 1965, with a residency lasting 42 weeks. Some of his subsequent material mocked the trial and tax in general. For a while, he introduced his act with the words, "Good evening, my name is Kenneth Arthur Dodd; singer, photographic playboy and failed accountant!"&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,11710,1332768,00.html | work=The Guardian | title=Tickling shtick | date=23 October 2004 | location=London | first=Charles | last=Nevin | accessdate=7 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another memorable gag in regards to the matter was Dodd saying that when income tax was introduced it was a mere 2p in every £1 earned, followed by the punchline "I thought it still was!"

==Honours==
[[File:KenDoddStatueLimeStreet.jpg|thumb|upright|Right|The statue of Dodd at [[Liverpool Lime Street railway station]]]]
He was appointed [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] (OBE) in the [[1982 New Year Honours]] for services to show business and charity and was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in the [[2017 New Year Honours]] for services to entertainment and charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=61803 |supp=y|page=N2|date=31 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The award was formally conferred by [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge]] in a ceremony at [[Buckingham Palace]] on 2 March 2017.&lt;ref name="BBC-39141859"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-39141859|title=Sir Ken Dodd 'tickled' by knighthood|date=2 March 2017|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993 Dodd won Top Variety Entertainer and was also awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award at [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s [[British Comedy Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/british_comedy_awards/episodes/1993/1/|title=The British Comedy Awards British Comedy Awards 1993 - British Comedy Guide|first=British Comedy|last=Guide|website=British Comedy Guide|accessdate=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, Dodd appeared in the TV special ''[[An Audience with...|An Audience with Ken Dodd]]''. The show was a success and introduced him to a younger audience.&lt;ref name=bbcobit/&gt; Dodd later became one of a select few to be given a second show, entitled ''Another Audience with Ken Dodd'' and originally broadcast in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media notes|title=Another Audience With Ken Dodd|publisher=Universal|asin=B00007DWN9|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Ken-Dodd-Another-Audience-DVD/dp/B00007DWN9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1955, Dodd began a 22-year relationship with Anita Boutin;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/sir-ken-dodds-widow-says-12206252|title=Sir Ken Dodd's widow shares her heartbreak - and how her husband is comforting her even after death|work=The Mirror|date=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; they were engaged at the time of her death from a brain tumour in 1977, at the age of 45.&lt;ref name="independentie"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sir Ken Dodd dies at 90: Comedy world pays tribute to 'one of all-time greats' |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/03/12/comedy-legend-sir-ken-dodd-dies-aged-90 |accessdate=14 March 2018 |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after her death, Dodd began a relationship with Anne Jones, which lasted from 1978 until his death. They first met in 1961 when Jones appeared in ''The Ken Dodd Christmas Show'' at the [[Manchester Opera House]]. Dodd married Jones on 9 March 2018, two days before his death.&lt;ref name="independentie"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.ie/entertainment/obituary-sir-ken-dodd-tickled-audiences-pink-for-decades-36694616.html|title=Obituary: Sir Ken Dodd tickled audiences pink for decades|work=Independent.ie|date=13 March 2018|accessdate=13 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-43367267|title=Sir Ken Dodd: Comedy legend dies, aged 90|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dodd said that one of his biggest regrets in life was that he never had children. It was widely reported that he and Anne were unable to conceive naturally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=metro.co.uk/2018/03/28/ken-dodds-wife-anne-jones-children-said-7422708/}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his 1989 trial details of his personal life surfaced in the media, including revelations that he and Anne had undergone several failed rounds of IVF treatment in an attempt to start a family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.express.co.uk/celebrity-news/930428/Ken-Dodd-dead-partner-Anne-Jones-wife-married-news-cause-of-death-how-did-die-Sir}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2001, a stalker, Ruth Tagg, harassed Dodd and Jones by sending them threatening letters and a dead rat, also appearing on the front row at almost all of his live shows during this time. She also attempted to burn down their house by pushing burning rags through the letterbox causing £11,000 worth of damage to the ground floor. Tagg pleaded guilty to [[Harassment in the United Kingdom|harassment]] and [[Criminal damage in English law#Arson|arson]] at [[Preston Crown Court]] in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2819343.stm|title=Stalker set fire to Dodd's home|work=BBC News|date=4 March 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tickling sticks were placed on various statues around Liverpool in commemoration. At [[Liverpool Town Hall]], [[St George's Hall, Liverpool|St George's Hall]], the [[Cunard Building]] and [[Liverpool Central Library]], flags were lowered to pay respect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-43556933|title=Sir Ken Dodd: Fans turn out for comedian's Liverpool funeral|work=BBC News|date=28 March 2018|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
