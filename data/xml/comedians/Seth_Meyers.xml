Meyers joined the ''Saturday Night Live'' cast in [[Saturday Night Live (season 27)|2001]].&lt;ref name="nbc" /&gt;  In 2005, he was promoted to writing supervisor, and in January 2006 he became co-head writer, sharing the role with [[Tina Fey]] and Andrew Steele.&lt;ref name=today&gt;{{cite news| title= New 'SNL' cast members playing big roles| date=February 8, 2006| work= [[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]]| url= http://www.today.com/id/11151558/ns/today-today_entertainment/t/new-snl-cast-members-playing-big-roles/ | agency=[[Associated Press]]| accessdate= August 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2004, he auditioned to co-anchor ''[[Weekend Update]]'' with Fey, but lost to [[Amy Poehler]].&lt;ref name=levin06&gt;{{cite news| first=Gary| last=Levin| date=September 29, 2006| title='SNL' will update its Weekend Update| url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2006-09-28-snl-update_x.htm?hiddenMacValue=0&amp;hiddenMacPrintValue=0| work=[[USA Today]]| accessdate= August 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With Fey's departure, Meyers became head writer for the 2006–2007 season and also assumed the role of ''Weekend Update'' co-anchor with [[Amy Poehler]].&lt;ref name=serpeE!&gt;{{cite news| title=Fey, Dratch Give Up Saturday Night| date=July 24, 2006| last=Serpe| first=Gina| url= http://www.eonline.com/news/52874/fey-dratch-give-up-saturday-night| accessdate= August 7, 2014| work=[[E!]] News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= mahan&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.tv.com/story/6449.html |title=Seth Meyers will coanchor Weekend Update |date= September 22, 2006 |first= Colin |last= Mahan |accessdate= August 7, 2014 |publisher=[[tv.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After Poehler's departure, Meyers anchored solo between 2008 and 2013. In the 2013–2014 season, [[Cecily Strong]] joined Meyers as co-anchor.  In fall 2009, Meyers co-anchored two episodes of ''[[Saturday Night Live Weekend Update Thursday]]'' with Poehler.&lt;ref name=ausiello&gt;{{cite news| last= Ausiello| first= Michael| url= http://ausiellofiles.ew.com/2009/07/30/amy-poehler-returns-to-snl/| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090801123507/http://ausiellofiles.ew.com/2009/07/30/amy-poehler-returns-to-snl/| dead-url=yes| archive-date=August 1, 2009| title= Exclusive: Amy Poehler returns to 'SNL' (REALLY?!)| date=July 30, 2009| work=Entertainment Weekly| accessdate= August 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On ''SNL'', Meyers [[impersonator|impersonated]] such figures as [[John Kerry]], [[Michael Caine]], [[Anderson Cooper]], [[Carrot Top]], [[Prince Charles]], [[Ryan Seacrest]], [[Sean Penn]], [[Stone Phillips]], [[Tobey Maguire]], [[Peyton Manning]], [[Ben Curtis (actor)|Ben Curtis]] (also known as the Dell Dude), [[Ty Pennington]], [[Bill Cowher]], [[Brian Williams]], [[Nicollette Sheridan]], [[Wade Robson]], [[Donald Trump, Jr.]], [[Tom Cruise]], and [[Kevin Federline]].&lt;ref name="nbc"/&gt;  His recurring characters included Zach Ricky, host of the kids' hidden camera show "Pranksters"; Nerod, the receptionist in the recurring sketch "Appalachian Emergency Room"; David Zinger, a scientist who often insults his fellow workers; DJ Johnathan Feinstein, the DJ on the webcam show "Jarett's Room"; Dan Needler, half of a married couple "that should be divorced," (opposite Amy Poehler); William Fitzpatrick, from the Irish talk show "Top o' the Morning," and Boston Powers (one of the comedians in the "Original Kings of Catchphrase Comedy" series). In the season 29 episode hosted by [[Lindsay Lohan]], he portrayed [[Ron Weasley]] in a parody of ''[[Harry Potter]]''.

Meyers received critical praise for his part in several iconic ''SNL'' sketches during his tenure. During the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 United States presidential election]], Meyers wrote the sketches for former ''SNL'' cast member Tina Fey, who returned as a guest star to impersonate [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] vice presidential candidate [[Sarah Palin]]. Meyers created the famed phrase uttered by Fey's Palin, "I can see Russia from my house."&lt;ref name= Scholibo&gt;{{cite news| last= Scholibo| first= Corey| date=November 19, 2008| title= Seth Meyers' Big Gay Saturday Night| url=http://www.advocate.com/news/2008/11/19/seth-meyers39s-big-gay-saturday-night| work=[[The Advocate]]| accessdate= August 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "usatoday10"&gt;{{cite news| last1= Deerwester| first1= Jayme| title= 10 classic Seth Meyers moments from 'SNL' |url= https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2014/02/01/seth-meyers-moments-snl/5115661/| accessdate= June 16, 2017| work= USA Today | date= February 1, 2014| language= en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "hr13114"&gt;{{cite news| last1= Couch| first1= Aaron| title= Seth Meyers' Best 'Saturday Night Live' Moments (Video)| url= http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/video-seth-meyers-best-saturday-675953| accessdate= June 16, 2017| work= [[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date= January 31, 2014| language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During their time as hosts on ''Weekend Update'', Meyers and Poehler had a popular recurring bit, "Really!?! with Seth and Amy." Both hosts would take turns mocking people in the news, ending each point with a heavily sarcastic "Really!?!", which ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' writer Jon Blistein characterized as a "torrent of exasperation and bewilderment." Following Poehler's departure from the show in 2008, they revived the "Really!?!" segment several times when she returned as a guest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last1= McGlynn| first1= Katla| title= Amy Poehler Returns To 'Weekend Update' For 'Really?!?'

Additionally, the "[[Abraham Lincoln|Abe Lincoln]]" sketch Meyers wrote for [[Louis C.K.]], done in the style of his sitcom, ''[[Louie (U.S. TV series)|Louie]]'', and the ''[[Girls (TV series)|Girls]]'' parody starring Tina Fey as the new Albanian "girl" were praised by critics as among the best sketches Meyers contributed to ''SNL''.&lt;ref name="usatoday10"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "hr13114"/&gt;

Meyers supported and picketed during the [[2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike]]. When interviewed, he said, "We all know how lucky we are to have the jobs we have. We're not asking for much. You have to change the rules because people are watching TV in a different way." &lt;ref name=levin07&gt;{{cite news| last=Levin| first=Gary| date=November 6, 2007| title=Writers Strike: Late night without Letterman, Leno| url= http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2007-11-05-writers-strike-main_N.htm| work= USA Today| accessdate= August 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, he mentioned in interviews that he regretted missing much of the [[United States presidential election, 2008#Nominations|presidential election primary season]].&lt;ref name= levin08&gt;{{cite news| last=Levin| first=Gary| date=February 20, 2008| title=Weekend update: 'SNL' is back in the race| work=USA Today| url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2008-02-19-saturday-night-live_N.htm| accessdate= August 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=postscripts&gt;{{cite magazine| last=Meyers| first=Seth| date=February 29, 2008| title=7 Writers' Strike Postscripts: Saturday Night Live| work=Entertainment Weekly| issue= 980| page= 40| url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20179357_3,00.html| accessdate= August 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meyers performed in his final episode of ''SNL'' February 1, 2014.  Strong, Poehler, [[Bill Hader]] in character as [[Stefon]], [[Andy Samberg]], and [[Fred Armisen]] as former New York state governor [[David Paterson]] joined him at the Weekend Update desk.

===''Late Night''===
NBC announced May 12, 2013, that Meyers would be the new host of ''Late Night'' in 2014 succeeding [[Jimmy Fallon]], as Fallon became host of ''[[The Tonight Show]]''.
