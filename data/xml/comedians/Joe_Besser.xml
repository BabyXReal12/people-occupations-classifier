'''Joe Besser''' (August 12, 1907 – March 1, 1988) was an American actor, voice actor, [[comedian]] and musician, known for his impish humor and wimpy characters. He is best known for his brief stint as a member of [[the Three Stooges]] in movie short subjects of 1957–59. He is also remembered for his television roles: Stinky, the bratty man-child in ''[[The Abbott and Costello Show]]'', and Jillson, the maintenance man in ''[[The Joey Bishop Show (sitcom)|The Joey Bishop Show]]''.

==Early life==
Besser was born in [[St. Louis, Missouri]] on August 12, 1907. He was the ninth child of Morris and Fanny Besser, who were [[Jew]]ish immigrants from [[Eastern Europe]]. He had seven older sisters, and an older brother Manny who was in show business, primarily as an [[ethnic]] Jewish comic. From an early age, Joe was fascinated with show business, especially the magic act of [[Howard Thurston]] that visited St. Louis annually. When Joe was 12, Thurston allowed him to be an audience plant. Besser was so excited by this, he sneaked into Thurston's train after the St. Louis run of the show was over, and was discovered the next day sleeping on top of the lion's cage in Detroit.

Thurston relented, informed Besser's parents of the situation, and trained him as an assistant. The first act involved pulling a rabbit out of a hat. The trick involved two rabbits, one hidden in a pocket of Thurston's cape. But young Besser was so nervous that he botched badly, pulling out the rabbit from the cape at the same time as the other rabbit was on display, before the trick had been performed. The audience roared with laughter, and Besser from then on was assigned "comic mishap" roles only.  Besser was placed by St. Louis juvenile authorities in a "corrective school" (reform school) at age 12.&lt;ref&gt;http://0-persi.heritagequestonline.com.iii.slcl.org/hqoweb/library/do/census/results/image?surname=besser&amp;givenname=joseph&amp;series=14&amp;state=5&amp;hitcount=2&amp;p=1&amp;urn=urn%3Aproquest%3AUS%3Bcensus%3B14842165%3B105172537%3B14%3B5&amp;searchtype=1&amp;offset=0&lt;/ref&gt;

== Acting career ==
Besser remained in show business and developed a unique comic character: a whiny, bratty, impish guy who was easily excitable and upset, throwing temper tantrums with little provocation. Besser, with his frequent outbursts of "You crazy, ''youuuuu''!" and "Not so ''faaaaaast''!" or "Not so ''harrrrd''!!" was so original and so outrageously silly that he became a vaudeville headliner, and movie and radio appearances soon followed.

The zany comedy team of [[Olsen and Johnson]], whose [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] revues were fast-paced collections of songs and blackouts, hired Joe Besser to join their company. Besser's noisy intrusions were perfect for their anything-can-happen format. Besser's work caught the attention of the [[Shubert family|Shubert]] brothers, who signed Besser to a theatrical contract. [[Columbia Pictures]] hired Besser away from the Shuberts, and Besser relocated to Hollywood in 1944, where he brought his unique comic character to feature-length musical comedies like ''Hey, Rookie'' and ''[[Eadie Was a Lady]]'' (1945). On May 9, 1946 Besser appeared on the pioneer NBC television program ''[[Hour Glass (TV series)|Hour Glass]]'', performing his "Army Drill" routine with stage partner Jimmy Little. According to an article in the May 27, 1946 issue of ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine, the show was seen by about 20,000 people on about 3,500 television sets, mostly in the New York City area.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZEsEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA84#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Life Magazine May 27, 1946]&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, he appeared on the [[Jack Benny]] radio program in the episode entitled "Jack Prepares For Carnegie Hall" in June, 1943. Besser also starred in short-subject comedies for Columbia from 1949 to 1956. By this point, his persona was sufficiently well known that he was frequently caricatured in ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' animated shorts of the era. He appeared in the action film ''[[The Desert Hawk (1950 film)|The Desert Hawk]]'' (1950).

Besser had substituted for Lou Costello on radio, opposite [[Bud Abbott]], and by the 1950s he was firmly established as one of the [[Abbott and Costello]] regulars. When the duo filmed ''[[The Abbott and Costello Show]]'' for television, they hired Joe Besser to play Oswald "Stinky" Davis, a bratty, loudmouthed child dressed in an oversized [[Little Lord Fauntleroy]] outfit, shorts, and a flat top hat with overhanging brim. He appeared during the first season of ''The Abbott and Costello Show''. Besser was cast for the role of Yonkel, a chariot man in the low-budget [[Bible|biblical]] film ''[[Sins of Jezebel]]'' (1953) which starred [[Paulette Goddard]] as the titular wicked queen.

===The Three Stooges===
After [[Shemp Howard]] died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] on November 22, 1955 at age 60, his brother [[Moe Howard|Moe]] suggested that he and teammate [[Larry Fine]] continue working as "The Two Stooges". Studio chief [[Harry Cohn]] rejected the proposal. Although Moe had legal approval to allow new members into the act, [[Columbia Pictures|Columbia]] executives had the final say about any actor who would appear in the studio's films, and insisted on a performer already under contract to Columbia: Joe Besser. At the time, Besser was one of a few comedians still making comedy shorts at the studio. He successfully renegotiated his contract, and was paid his former feature-film salary, which was more than the other Stooges earned.

Besser refrained from imitating Curly or Shemp. He continued to play the same whiny character he had developed over his long career. He had a clause in his contract prohibiting being hit excessively. Besser recalled, "I usually played the kind of character who would hit others back". He claimed that Larry volunteered to take the brunt of Moe's screen abuse. In a 2002 [[E!]] channel program which used file footage of Besser, the comic stated that the left side of [[Larry Fine]]'s face was noticeably coarser than the other side, which he attributed to Moe's slaps.

As a result of his whiny persona and lack of true slapstick punishment against him (the cornerstone of Stooge humor), Joe has been less popular with contemporary Stooge aficionados, so much so, that "Stooge-a-Polooza" TV host [[Rich Koz]] has even apologized on the air before showing Besser shorts; during the show's tenure he received more than a few letters from viewers expressing their outrage over his airing them. Besser does have his defenders, however: Columbia historians Edward Watz and [[Ted Okuda]] have written appreciatively of Besser bringing new energy to what was by then a flagging theatrical series.&lt;ref name="Okuda"&gt;{{cite book| last = Okuda| first = Ted | authorlink = Ted Okuda|author2=Watz, Edward | title = The Columbia Comedy Shorts| publisher = McFarland &amp; Company, Inc., Publishers| year = 1986| location = | pages =60–102, 237–239| id = | isbn = 0-89950-181-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Stooges shorts with Besser were filmed from the spring of 1956 to the end of 1957. His Stooge tenure ended when Columbia shut down the two-reel-comedy department on December 20, 1957. Producer-director [[Jules White]] had shot enough film for 16 comedies, which were released a few months apart until June 1959, with ''[[Sappy Bull Fighters]]'' being the final release.

Moe Howard and Larry Fine discussed plans to tour with a live act, but Besser declined. His wife had suffered a heart attack in November 1957, and he was unwilling to leave without her. In later life, Besser praised Moe and Larry in a 1985 radio interview, of which a quote from said interview was aired on [[A&amp;E Network]]'s ''[[Biography (TV series)|Biography]]''. Besser said:
{{quote|text="...Moe and Larry, they were the best. I enjoyed every minute of it with them. In fact, to show you how wonderful they were, I never liked to be hit with anything. And Larry would always say to me, 'Don't worry Joe, I'll take it.' Now that's the kind of guys that they were..."}}

===After the Stooges===
Besser returned to films and television, most notably as the superintendent Jillson for four seasons (1961–1965) of ''[[Joey Bishop|The Joey Bishop Show]]''. He also made occasional appearances on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] late-night series, also called ''The Joey Bishop Show'' between 1967 and 1969. Besser also had roles on ''[[The Mothers-in-Law]]'', ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'', ''[[The Good Guys (1968 TV series)|The Good Guys]]'', ''[[That Girl]]'', and ''[[Love, American Style]]''.&lt;ref name=besser/&gt; He provided the voice of the dragon on ''[[The Alvin Show]] (1960)

Besser also provided voices for several [[Saturday Morning cartoon]] series in the 1970s. He voiced the character Putty Puss in ''[[The Houndcats]]'' (1972), bumbling genie Babu in ''[[Jeannie (TV series)|Jeannie]]'' (1973), (inspired by ''[[I Dream of Jeannie]]'') and ''[[Scooby's All-Star Laff-A-Lympics]]'', and as Scare Bear in ''[[Yogi's Space Race]]'' (1978).&lt;ref name=besser&gt;{{cite book | last = Besser  | first = Joe | authorlink = |author2=Jeff Lenburg |author3=Greg Lenburg  | title = Not Just a Stooge | publisher = Excelsior Books| year = 1984 | location = [[Orange, California]]  | pages = 200–201, 203–205 | url = https://www.amazon.com/Not-Just-Stooge-Joe-Besser/dp/0918283000/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1388716575&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=not+just+a+stooge | doi = | id =  | isbn = 978-0918283009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besser's career slowed somewhat after he suffered a minor [[stroke]] in 1979, resulting in considerable weight loss.&lt;ref name=besser/&gt;

Later in life, Besser expressed some dismay that people only recognized him for his brief tenure with the Stooges. However, he eventually softened, realizing that the Stooges continued to bring him his greatest exposure.&lt;ref name=besser/&gt;

In 1984, Besser co-wrote with authors Jeff and Greg Lenburg his autobiography, ''Not Just a Stooge'', for Excelsior Books.&lt;ref name=besser/&gt; The book would be later retitled and re-published as ''Once a Stooge, Always a Stooge'' following his death in 1988.

Joe Besser recalled his friendship with the Stooges in an emotional speech referring to "the four boys [Moe, Larry, Curly, and Shemp] . . . up in heaven" looking down at the dedication of a star to The Three Stooges on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] on August 30, 1983. Stooges co-actor [[Emil Sitka]] also spoke; the only other surviving Stooge, [[Joe DeRita]], was ill at the time, though he outlived Besser by five years.&lt;ref name=besser/&gt;

In the spring of 2000, ABC aired a made-for-television movie about the Stooges, with actor Laurence Coy appearing briefly as Besser.

==Personal life==
In 1932, Besser married dancer Erna Kay (born Ernestine Dora Kretschmer), known as "Ernie". The couple had no children.  They were neighbors and friends of [[Lou Costello]], of the [[Abbott and Costello]] duo. Besser appeared in the Abbott and Costello movie ''[[Africa Screams]]'' (1949), which also featured [[Shemp Howard]] of [[the Three Stooges]]. Joe and Shemp were old friends, having met in 1932. 

His cousin's grandson is [[Upright Citizens Brigade]] theater co-founder and improviser/comedian [[Matt Besser]].

==Death==
Joe Besser was found dead in his home on March 1, 1988. He was aged 80 and died of [[heart failure]]. His wife Erna died on July 1, 1989, from a heart attack at age 89. Both spouses are buried in the same plot in the [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Glendale|Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery]], in [[Glendale, California]]. Joe's marker reads, "Joe Besser / August 12, 1907-March 1, 1988 / He Brought the World Love and Laughter", while Erna's reads, "Ernestine Besser / March 14, 1900-July 1, 1989 / In Loving Memory." Besser's Stooge partner [[Larry Fine]] is in a crypt at the Freedom Mausoleum, which is a short distance away from the tomb.
