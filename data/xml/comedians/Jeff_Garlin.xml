==Personal life==
[[File:2016-WS-G4 Jeff Garlin.jpg|thumbnail|200px|Garlin is an avid fan of the Chicago Cubs. In this image, he is seen in Wrigleyville before Game Four of the [[2016 World Series]].]]
Garlin married Marla Beth Cahan in 1994. They have two sons: James (b. 1996), and Duke (b. 2000). They live in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=NYTimes-Mag-2006/&gt;

Having grown up around Chicago, Garlin is a fan of the [[Chicago Cubs]].&lt;ref name=Poscast&gt;{{cite news|last1=Posnanski|first1=Joe|title=The Poscast - Stories: Jeff Garlin|url=http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/the-poscast/e/45318595?autoplay=true|accessdate=July 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Garlin is a practitioner of [[transcendental meditation]], which he does twice a day.&lt;ref name=TheGuardian-Curb-2011&gt;{{cite news|last1=Puckrik|first1=Katie|title=Jeff Garlin: 'Monty Python changed my life'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/jun/22/jeff-garlin-curb-your-enthusiasm|accessdate=January 23, 2015|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=June 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He says that it has helped him with the symptoms of [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder predominantly inattentive|ADHD]].&lt;ref name=Rookie-2011&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pixie|title=Can I Please Say This? Jeff Garlin talks to us about ADD, eating disorders, and why adversity is the best thing that can happen to you.|url=http://www.rookiemag.com/2011/10/can-i-please-say-this|accessdate=January 23, 2015|work=[[Rookie (magazine)|Rookie]]|date=October 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health===
Garlin had surgery in [[Oklahoma City]] when he was in his late 20s to correct [[Wolff–Parkinson–White syndrome]], a heart condition, which is an [[accessory pathway|accessory electrical conduction pathway]] in the heart that results in [[tachycardia]].&lt;ref name=WTF-Maron-2015/&gt; Garlin said he was an early recipient (#72) of the surgery, which millions of people have now had done. In February 2000, before filming began on ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'', he had a stroke, when he was 37 years old. During the early episodes of [[List of Curb Your Enthusiasm episodes|Season One]], he had noticeably slurred speech, although his speech later improved. He also has [[type II diabetes]], which he controls with diet and exercise.&lt;ref name=WTF-Maron-2015/&gt;

Garlin has written about his issues with food and has discussed his weight issues publicly.&lt;ref name=TheGuardian-Curb-2011/&gt; In a 2011 interview, Garlin said: "I think people look at fat people as having a lack of willpower when willpower has nothing to do with it. I didn’t change my life until I approached everything like an addict. I haven’t had sweets in almost three years because I know if I have one cookie, just like if an alcoholic has his first drink, I’m off to the races and I’m back eating sugar again."&lt;ref name=Rookie-2011/&gt;
