'''Emo Philips''' (born February 7, 1956) is an American [[stand-up comedian]], actor, voice actor, writer and producer. His stand-up comedy persona makes use of [[paraprosdokian]]s spoken in a wandering [[falsetto]] tone of voice. The confused, childlike delivery of his material produces the intended [[comic timing]] in a manner invoking the "wisdom of children" or the [[idiot savant]].

== Career ==
The character of Emo Philips is widely known for his unique look and on-stage antics, appearing as a fidgety, possibly mentally disturbed, nervous but highly intelligent individual with an obsession for [[coleslaw]].&lt;ref name="Spin1985"&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Melissa|last=Rossi|title=Extraterrestrial comic? Nerd god? Or less?|work=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W-XEpPcqekMC&amp;pg=PA13|date=October 1985|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Philips constantly moves throughout the routine, often shifting from sitting to standing positions, wandering from end to end on stage, playing with his hair or clothing, or going as far as to partially undress as he delivers punchlines.  His comedy, which is largely self-deprecating and ironic, is often delivered in a modulated falsetto.  His look (occasionally described as geeky, disco and vaudeville-inspired), particularly his hair - a 1970s style bob with straight lined front fringe - has been a signature part of his appearance and act for most of his career.

Philips has recorded three comedy albums. His album ''E=mo²'', recorded live at [[Caroline's]] in [[Manhattan, New York City]], won the 1985 [[New Music Awards|New Music Award]] for best comedy album. It was later re-released along with his ''Live at the [[Hasty Pudding Theatricals|Hasty Pudding]] Theatre'' album on a single [[compact disc|CD]]. He also released an album called ''Emo'' in 2001. A joke of his was voted funniest religious joke ever in a 2005 online poll.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Philips|first=Emo|title=The best God joke ever - and it's mine!|date=29 September 2005|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2005/sep/29/comedy.religion|accessdate=Jan 10, 2009|location=London|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, he appeared at the [[Newbury Comedy Festival]]. He was included in the top 50 of ''E4''{{'}}s 100 Greatest Comedians, and also appeared number 54 on Channel 4's top 100 greatest standups.

Aside from Philips' long career as a standup comic, he has been featured in [[acting]] roles on [[television series]] such as ''[[Miami Vice]]'' and ''[[The Weird Al Show]]''. In 2006, he appeared on [[United Kingdom|British]] television, as a guest on the [[panel game]] ''[[8 Out of 10 Cats]]''. Philips has several voiceover credits, including work on the animated series ''[[Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist]]''; ''[[Home Movies (cartoon series)|Home Movies]]''; ''[[Space Ghost Coast to Coast]]''; ''[[Adventure Time]]'' as Cuber the mysterious storyteller; and the voice of Dooper in the animated series ''[[Slacker Cats]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Slacker Cats" Coming to ABC Family|url=http://www.catchannel.com/News/slacker-cats.aspx|accessdate=2006-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Philips has also appeared on 4 episodes of [[@midnight]], in February 2015, April 8, 2016, a 1990s themed episode on September 26, 2016, and the finale episode on August 4, 2017.

He has appeared in [[feature film]]s including 1989's ''[[UHF (film)|UHF]]'' (as Joe Earley, a rather clumsy school shop teacher who accidentally saws his thumb off) and ''[[Desperation Boulevard]]'' in 1998.  Additionally, he appeared in the original 1992 version of ''[[Meet the Parents (1992 film)|Meet the Parents]]'' (also [[Film producer|executive producer]]) and was an associate producer of the [[Meet the Parents|2000 remake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Emo Philips|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0680073/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cr4|website=imdb.com|accessdate=11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 2001, Philips began to appear more often after a hiatus in the 1990s.  His look was drastically altered, appearing more "new millennium" rather than his signature bob and 1970s casual disco look.  Now embracing salt &amp; pepper spiked up grey hair, sporting a [[goatee]] and dressed in black active sportswear, Philips delivered the same comedy routine but with a much more subdued persona.  Though still fidgety, Philips no longer carried random props or undressed himself as he used to.  Like most of the [[Reagan Era]] comedians, Philips felt the need to adapt to changing times and styles of the flourishing [[digital age]] in an effort to stay relevant to younger audiences, particularly later year [[Generation X]] and [[Millennials]] who comprised the majority of college populations during the early part of the 2000s.

Emo only carried this appearance for a few years, retiring it in 2005 and emerging back on the comedy circuit around 2010 with his classic look and persona.  He has experienced a considerable resurgence in popularity since then and has been a featured performer at many national comedy tours over the last several years, appearing at the ''Moontower Comedy Festival'' in [[Austin, Texas]] and appearing frequently on [[24/7 Comedy]].

[["Weird Al" Yankovic]] announced that he and Philips will be on tour together throughout the USA in 2018, in Yankovic's ''[[The Ridiculously Self-Indulgent, Ill-Advised Vanity Tour]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Weird Al's facebook page|url=https://www.facebook.com/weirdal/posts/10155536586691005|website=facebook.com|accessdate=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
