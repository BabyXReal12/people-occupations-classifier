'''Tom Kennedy''' (July 15, 1885 – October 6, 1965) was an American [[actor]] known for his roles in [[Hollywood]] [[comedy film|comedies]] from the silent days, with such producers as [[Mack Sennett]] and [[Hal Roach]], mainly supporting lead [[comedian]]s such as the [[Marx Brothers]], [[W. C. Fields]], [[Mabel Normand]], [[Shemp Howard]], [[Laurel and Hardy]], and the [[The Three Stooges|Three Stooges.]] Kennedy also played dramatic roles as a supporting actor.

==Career==
[[File:Poster - Man of the Forest (1933) 05 (1).jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Barton MacLane]], Tom Kennedy, [[Noah Beery, Sr.|Noah Beery]], [[Randolph Scott]] and [[Verna Hillie]] in [[Henry Hathaway]]'s ''[[Man of the Forest]]'' (1933)]]
For over 50 years, from 1915 to 1965, he appeared in over 320 films and television series, often uncredited. His first film was a short black and white comedy ''His Luckless Love''. He was in all nine [[Torchy Blane]] films as Gahagan, the poetry-spouting cop whose running line was, "What a day! What a day!" He continued making films right up until his death, his last film being a [[western (genre)|western]] ''[[The Bounty Killer]]''.

Tom Kennedy is often erroneously listed in film sources as the brother of slow-burning comedian [[Edgar Kennedy]]. Though the two men were not related, they were apparently good friends, with Tom appearing in many of Edgar's domestic two-reel comedy [[short subjects|shorts]].

Kennedy was also paired with Stooge [[Shemp Howard]] for several shorts for [[Columbia Pictures]] such as ''[[Society Mugs]]'', as well as appearing with the [[The Three Stooges|Three Stooges]] in the films ''[[Loose Loot]]'' and ''[[Spooks (1953 film)|Spooks!]]''. He was also paired with [[El Brendel]] for four shorts, such as ''[[Phoney Cronies]]'' in 1942.

His television appearances included episodes of ''[[Perry Mason (TV series)|Perry Mason]]'', ''[[Maverick (TV series)|Maverick]]'', ''[[My Favorite Martian]]'' and ''[[Gunsmoke]]''.
