'''Bret Peter Tarrant McKenzie''', [[New Zealand Order of Merit|ONZM]] (born 29 June 1976) is an Oscar and Grammy winning New Zealand comedian, actor, musician and producer. He is one half of musical comedy duo [[Flight of the Conchords]] along with [[Jemaine Clement]]. The duo's comedy and music became the basis of a [[Flight of the Conchords (radio series)|BBC radio series]] and then an oft-lauded [[Flight of the Conchords (TV series)|American television series]], which aired for two seasons on [[HBO]]. McKenzie served as music supervisor for two [[The Muppets|Muppet]] films, ''[[The Muppets (film)|The Muppets]] ''(2011) and ''[[Muppets Most Wanted]] ''(2014), the former of which won him an [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] for the song "[[Man or Muppet]]". His latest work has seen him write the lyrics to the 2016 [[Sainsburys]] Christmas advert featuring [[James Corden]] on vocals. &lt;ref&gt;

As an actor, he portrayed [[Lindir]] in [[Peter Jackson]]'s [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'']] and [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'']] film trilogies, respectively: in the first he remained unnamed with fans naming him [[Figwit]], a character originally cast as an extra who gained attention thanks to the trilogy's [[Fandom|fan community]], and in ''The Hobbit'' is credited as [[Lindir]], a small character who originally appears in the book of ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]''.

==Background==
McKenzie was born in [[Wellington]], [[New Zealand]]. He is a former member of [[The Black Seeds]]. He released an album called ''Prototype'' as Video Kid&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.videokid.tv/ |title=Video Kid}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is a member of the [[Wellington International Ukulele Orchestra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ukulele.co.nz |title=Wellington International Ukulele Orchestra}}&lt;/ref&gt; McKenzie attended Clifton Terrace Model School ("model" refers to a standard school for training teachers as opposed to [[model (person)|modelling]]), [[Wellington College (New Zealand)|Wellington College]] and then [[Victoria University of Wellington]] where he met [[Jemaine Clement]] who was also studying film and theatre. Together, they were members of [[So You're a Man]] and they later formed Flight of the Conchords.

As Flight of the Conchords they have toured internationally and released four CDs: ''[[Folk the World Tour]]'' in 2002,''[[The Distant Future]]'' (which won the [[Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album]]) in 2007, the Grammy nominated ''[[Flight of the Conchords (album)|Flight of the Conchords]]'' in 2008, and ''[[I Told You I Was Freaky]]'' in 2009. The Conchords produced a six-part improvisational comedy radio program for the [[BBC]] and have appeared on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'', the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' and ''[[The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson]]''. After a successful appearance in 2005 on [[Home Box Office|HBO]]s ''[[One Night Stand (US TV series)|One Night Stand]]'', the Conchords were offered their own 12-part HBO series ''[[Flight of the Conchords (TV series)|Flight of the Conchords]]''.  Its first season ran from June to September 2007, and its second season premiered on HBO 18 January 2009.

McKenzie has appeared in the first and third films in [[Peter Jackson]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' trilogy. His silent role in the first film as [[Figwit]] achieved some minor internet fame, which led to Jackson giving him a line in the third film. In April 2011, McKenzie was cast as the elf [[Lindir]] for ''[[The Hobbit (film series)|The Hobbit]]''. His father [[Peter McKenzie (actor)|Peter McKenzie]] played the role of [[Elendil]] in ''Lord of the Rings''.

Along with Clement, McKenzie was featured as one of 2008's "100 Sexiest People" in a special edition of the Australian magazine [[Who (magazine)|''Who'']].

McKenzie and fellow Conchord Clement guest starred as a pair of camp counselors in "[[Elementary School Musical (The Simpsons)|Elementary School Musical]]", the season premiere of the [[The Simpsons (season 22)|22nd]] season of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', which aired on 26 September 2010.&lt;ref name="Simpsons"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Gleeful over Glee: Cory Monteith to appear on The Simpsons|author=Strachan, Alex|url=http://www.canada.com/Gleeful+over+Glee+Cory+Monteith+appear+Simpsons/3350970/story.html|publisher=[[Canada.com]]|date=2 August 2010|accessdate=2010-08-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111028000202/http://www2.canada.com/gleeful+over+glee+cory+monteith+appear+simpsons/3350970/story.html|archivedate=28 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the summer of 2010, McKenzie flew to Los Angeles to serve as the music supervisor for [[The Muppets (film)|''The Muppets'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/film/4442796/Conchords-star-flies-south-for-new-film|title=Conchords star flies south|work=Stuff|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to write four of the five original songs from the film's soundtrack including "Man or Muppet" and "Life's a Happy Song" both of which were nominated for [[Broadcast Film Critics Association Awards]] and [[Satellite Awards]] for Best Original Song.&lt;ref&gt;[[Satellite Award for Best Original Song]]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[84th Academy Awards]] in 2012 his song, "[[Man or Muppet]]", won the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]].

McKenzie, together with Australian comedian [[Hamish Blake]] starred in a New Zealand feature film, ''[[Two Little Boys (film)|Two Little Boys]]'', finished in late 2011 and released in New Zealand on March 2012.&lt;ref name="DailyTelegraphAust_09Dec2010_SydneyConfidential_HamishBlaketostarwithBretMcKenzieinSarkies'TwoLittleBoys"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/sydney-confidential/hamish-blake-to-star-with-bret-mckenzie-in-sarkies-two-little-boys/story-e6frewz0-1225968460210|title=Hamish Blake to star with Bret McKenzie in Sarkies' Two Little Boys  |last=Catanzariti|first=Katelyn|date=9 December 2010|work=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)]]|publisher=[[News Corporation]]|accessdate=9 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
