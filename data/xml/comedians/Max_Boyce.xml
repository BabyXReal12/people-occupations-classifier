'''Maxwell Boyce''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|MBE}} (born 27 September 1943) is a [[Welsh people|Welsh]] [[comedian]], [[singer]] and entertainer. He rose to fame during the mid-1970s with an act that combined musical comedy with his passion for [[rugby union]] and his origins in the mining communities of [[South Wales]]. He has sold more than two million albums in a career spanning four decades.

==Early life==
Max Boyce was born in [[Glynneath]]. He has always lived there, but his family were originally from [[Ynyshir]] in the [[Rhondda]] Valley. A month preceding Boyce's birth, his father died in an explosion in the [[coal pit]] where he was working.&lt;ref name="BBCbio"&gt;{{cite web | work = BBC Wales | title = Max Boyce biography | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/music/sites/maxboyce/pages/biography.shtml | accessdate = 27 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of fifteen, Boyce left school, went to live with his grandfather, and followed his father's footsteps by working in a [[colliery]] "for nearly eight years".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite speech | title = Introduction to "Duw It's Hard" - ''Live at Treorchy'' album | date = 23 November 1973 | location = Treorchy, Wales | accessdate = 27 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his early twenties, he managed to find alternative work in the Metal Box factory, Melin, Neath as an electrician's apprentice, but his earlier mining experiences were to influence his music considerably in later years.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

Boyce first learned to play the [[guitar]] as a young man, but he showed no particular flair for the instrument,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Boyce | first = Max | title = I Was There! | publisher = Arrow Books Limited | year = 1980 | page = 11 | isbn = 0-09-924410-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; nor an actual desire to become a performer. In his own words: "[I had] no desire at all to be anything. I had a love of poetry, and eventually started writing songs without any ambition to build a career. It just happened. I started writing songs about local things and it evolved."&lt;ref name="BBCbio"/&gt; Nevertheless, in time he became competent enough to perform at local [[eisteddfod]]au, one of the earliest known recordings of his work being "{{lang|cy|O Na Le}}", a folk tune in [[Welsh language|Welsh]] which he played at the [[Dyffryn Lliw]] eisteddfod in 1967.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

In the early 1970s Boyce undertook a [[mining engineering]] degree at the [[Glamorgan]] School of Mines in [[Trefforest]] (now the [[University of South Wales]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tarleton|first=Alice|title=University of Glamorgan|url=http://education.independent.co.uk/higher/az_uni_colleges/article1208556.ece|accessdate=27 June 2007|location=London|work=The Independent|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070517121741/http://education.independent.co.uk/higher/az_uni_colleges/article1208556.ece|archivedate=17 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; during which he began to pen tunes about life in the mining communities of South Wales. He started out performing in local sports clubs and folk clubs around 1970, where his original set began to take on a humorous element, interspersed by anecdotes of Welsh community life and of the national sport, [[rugby union]].&lt;ref name="BBCbio"/&gt;

==Music career==
The first recording of Boyce's songs was made at the Valley Folk Club in [[Pontardawe]] in 1971 by Cambrian Records, which subsequently released an [[LP album|LP]] called ''Max Boyce in Session''. This album included several tracks that were to later become his signature tunes, including "Hymns and Arias", "Duw it's Hard" and "Slow - Men at Work". The record sleeve of this album includes the following prediction:
{{cquote|It may well be that future years will find "Hymns and Arias" rolling a thunderous chorus across the terraced rugby grounds.&lt;ref&gt;(1971) ''Max Boyce in Session'' [LP album]. Wales: Cambrian Records (MCT 207)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the same year, he also recorded ''{{lang|cy|Caneuon Amrywiol}}'' ("Miscellaneous Songs"), a collection of Welsh [[folk music|folk]] songs under the same label. Nevertheless, Boyce remained virtually unknown beyond the music clubs of the South Wales valleys for the time being, where he continued to perform.This all changed towards the end of 1973. Boyce had competed, unsuccessfully, on the television [[talent show]] ''[[Opportunity Knocks (UK TV series)|Opportunity Knocks]]'', shortly before record label [[EMI]] heard his first album, ''Max Boyce in Session'', and came to see him in concert. EMI offered Boyce a two-album contract, and arrangements were made to make a live recording of his upcoming concert at [[Treorchy]] [[Treorchy RFC|Rugby Club]]. This performance, which took place on 23 November 1973, was given in front of an audience who received their tickets free of charge, after these failed to sell for [[Fifty pence (British coin)|fifty pence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Max - A biography (part one)|url=http://www.maxboyce.co.uk/biog/index.htm|accessdate=27 June 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070513235136/http://www.maxboyce.co.uk/biog/index.htm|archivedate=13 May 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; His performance was warmly received by the crowd, as can be heard in the final recording. The resulting album, ''[[Live at Treorchy]]'', brought Boyce into the public eye, and it soon went [[gold disc|gold]].{{cn|date=July 2017}}

His next album, ''[[We All Had Doctors' Papers]]'', was another live album, recorded this time at [[Pontarddulais RFC|Pontarddulais Rugby Club]]. This was released in late 1975 and, unexpectedly, it reached the #1 position on the [[UK Albums Chart]] for the week ending 15 November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | work = UK Top 40 Hit Database | title = Number 1 Albums - 1970s | url=http://www.everyhit.com/numberalb3.html | accessdate = 27 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This recording has the distinction of being the only comedy album to ever top the UK Albums Chart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Official Max Boyce website |title=Max - A biography (part two) |url=http://www.maxboyce.co.uk/biog/biog_2.htm |accessdate=27 June 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070518025051/http://www.maxboyce.co.uk/biog/biog_2.htm |archivedate=18 May 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Boyce released several albums over the next few years, receiving further gold discs for ''The Incredible Plan'' in 1976, and ''I Know 'Cos I Was There'' in 1978.&lt;ref name="BBCbio"/&gt;

This early pinnacle in Boyce's career coincided with the dominance of the [[Wales national rugby union team|Welsh rugby team]] in the [[Five Nations Championship]] during the 1970s. His songs and poems were real-time reflections on this unfolding history, often invoking the names of Welsh rugby greats such as [[Barry John]], [[Gareth Edwards]] and [[Dai Morris]]. Songs such as "Hymns and Arias" soon became popular with rugby crowds, a fact which has played a significant part in his ongoing popularity. When Swansea City were promoted to the [[English Premier League]] in 2011, Boyce was asked to perform for their first game and produced a special version of "Hymns and Arias" for the occasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/new-version-hymns-arias-swans-1817144 |title=New version of Hymns and Arias for Swans home game |publisher=[[Wales Online]] |date= |accessdate=2017-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His rise to fame was confirmed by an appearance on the long-running biographical series ''[[This Is Your Life (UK TV series)|This Is Your Life]]'' on 22 February 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | work = IMDb | title = "This Is Your Life": Max Boyce (1978) | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0721821 | accessdate = 27 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had gone to watch [[Glynneath RFC]] play against Hawick Trades RFC, and was surprised by the host of ''This Is Your Life'', [[Eamonn Andrews]], at the end of the match whilst being interviewed.&lt;ref name="Max4"&gt;{{cite web| work =Official Max Boyce website |title=Max - a biography (Part 4) |url=http://www.maxboyce.co.uk/biog/biog_4.htm |accessdate=27 June 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927025758/http://www.maxboyce.co.uk/biog/biog_4.htm |archivedate=27 September 2007 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Television and other side projects==
As Boyce's popularity became established throughout Wales and the United Kingdom, he became involved in many side projects, including three books, several television series and televised concerts, and three multi-part [[television specials]] produced by [[Opix Films]].{{cn|date=July 2017}} His spoken and sung poetry was first collected in ''Max Boyce: His Songs and Poems'' in 1976, with an introduction by [[Barry John]]. The comic illustrations that accompany the poems were drawn by his friend [[Gren Jones (cartoonist)|Gren Jones]] of the ''[[South Wales Echo]]'' (who had also illustrated the cover of ''We All Had Doctors' Papers''). This publication was followed up with a similar collection, ''I Was There!'', in 1980.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

In 1982, Boyce went to the United States to be filmed participating at a training camp held by the [[Dallas Cowboys]] in [[California]]. The resulting four-part series, ''Max Boyce Meets The Dallas Cowboys'' was screened by [[Channel 4]] in November that year. He returned to America in early 1984 to try 
his hand at being a [[cowboy]] in the [[rodeo]]s of the [[Midwestern United States]]. The result of his [[bull riding]] and [[rodeo clown]] antics was ''Boyce Goes West'', which also became a four-part series that was broadcast in June 1984. 

In the following year, Boyce took part in the World [[elephant polo|Elephant Polo]] Championships near [[Kathmandu]], [[Nepal]], with an all-star team sponsored by the jewellers and watchmakers [[Cartier SA|Cartier]]. His team, consisting of [[Ringo Starr]], [[Barbara Bach]], [[Billy Connolly]] and Cartier chairman [[Alain Perrin (Cartier)|Alain Perrin]], only managed to score a single goal during the tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | work = World Elephant Polo Association | title = World Elephant Polo Association Championship 1985 | url = http://www.elephantpolo.com/html/tournaments/1985/index.html | accessdate = 27 June 2007 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928063336/http://www.elephantpolo.com/html/tournaments/1985/index.html | archivedate = 28 September 2007 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''To the North of Katmandu'' was released in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | work = IMDb | title = ''To the North of Katmandu'' (1986) | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0128768 | accessdate = 27 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These made-for-television adventures in America and Nepal, as well as many other anecdotes of his worldwide touring throughout the late 1970s and early 1980s, became the focus of an autobiography, ''Max Boyce in the Mad Pursuit of Applause'', which was first published in 1987.

In 1990, Boyce entered the world of [[theatre]] by taking on the title role of "Jack" in ''[[Jack and the Beanstalk]]'' alongside [[Ian Botham]]. Debuting in the [[Bradford Alhambra|Alhambra Theatre]] in [[Bradford]], the show went on to play in other centres including [[Cardiff]], [[Norwich]] and [[Edinburgh]].&lt;ref name="Max4"/&gt;

==Recent years==
Max Boyce has enjoyed a resurgence in his career since the late 1990s. At Christmas time in 1998, [[BBC Wales]] screened ''An Evening With Max Boyce'', which broke Welsh viewing records.&lt;ref name="BBCbio"/&gt; The  following year, in 1999, he performed at the opening ceremonies of the [[1999 Rugby World Cup]] in the [[Millennium Stadium]], and of the [[Welsh Assembly]]. Not long after, Boyce was included on the [[2000 New Year Honours]] list, and received an MBE from [[Prince Charles]] in a ceremony at [[Cardiff Castle]] on 15 March that year. According to Boyce, "He (the Prince) said he was surprised it took them so long" to accord him this honour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | work = BBC News | title = Prince Charles Honours Wales's Elite | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/678507.stm | accessdate = 27 June 2007 | date=15 March 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boyce's greatest musical success in recent years was his 2003 tour of [[Australia]], coinciding with the [[2003 Rugby World Cup|Rugby World Cup]] which was being hosted there at the time. He held concerts in [[Adelaide]] and [[Melbourne]], but the highlight was his sold-out performance at the [[Sydney Opera House]], which was later released on DVD as ''Max Boyce: Down Under''.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

Boyce continues to make headlines in the British press. On 29 May 2006 Max Boyce headlined at a concert in [[Pontypridd]] to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the Welsh national anthem, "[[Hen Wlad fy Nhadau]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | work = BBC News | title = Concert marks anthem anniversary | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/south_east/4755361.stm | accessdate = 27 June 2007 | date=9 May 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2006, he hit out against the stereotypical use of the word "[[boyo (slang)|boyo]]" in the media, following its resurgence in reference to Welsh ''[[Big Brother 2006 (UK)|Big Brother]]'' contestant [[Glyn Wise]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Clark | first = Rhodri | title = 'Boyo is demeaning' says Max Boyce | url=http://icwales.icnetwork.co.uk/0100news/0200wales/tm_objectid=17588424&amp;method=full&amp;siteid=50082&amp;headline=-boyo-is-demeaning--says-max-boyce-name_page.html | accessdate = 27 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Boyce returned to Treorchy in early 2011 to perform a show at the [[Parc and Dare Hall|Parc and Dare Theatre]], shown on [[St David's Day]] on BBC1 Wales. He was joined onstage by guests including [[Boyd Clack]], and the audience featured such Welsh icons as [[Gareth Edwards]].

His 70th birthday was celebrated with an hour-long programme&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Max Boyce's Big Birthday|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03bt7yv|publisher=BBC|accessdate=27 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; shown on BBC One Wales on 25 September 2013, recorded in front of a live celebrity audience.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

==Personal life==
Boyce has a wife and children, who live away from the public eye in his hometown of Glynneath, in South Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Hall of Fame profile: Max Boyce | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/southwest/halloffame/showbiz/max_boyce.shtml | accessdate = 27 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He continues to play an active role within this community, having been in recent years the president of Glynneath RFC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | work = Glynneath Online | title = Glynneath RFC | url = http://www.glynneath.gov.uk/clubs/rugby/ | accessdate = 27 June 2007 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070415113035/http://www.glynneath.gov.uk/clubs/rugby/ | archivedate = 15 April 2007 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Club President of Glynneath Golf Club, where the "Max Boyce Classic" is held every two or three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | work = Glynneath Golf Club | title = Max Boyce M.B.E.
