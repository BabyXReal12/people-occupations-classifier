==Early life==
Friedlander was born in [[Gaithersburg, Maryland]], the son of Shirley and Art Friedlander.&lt;ref name=NYTBIO/&gt;&lt;ref name=TRIBLIVE/&gt; His father was of Russian [[Jew]]ish descent and his mother, a native of [[Pittsburgh]], is [[Croatian American]].&lt;ref name=TRIBLIVE/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYMAG&gt;{{cite news |title=Judah Friedlander Thinks Manhattan Pizza Has ‘Gone Downhill’ |first=Alexandra |last=Vallis |url=http://newyork.grubstreet.com/2009/05/friedlander.html |newspaper=New York Magazine |date=May 22, 2009 |accessdate=October 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewish-theatre.com/visitor/article_display.aspx?articleID=2517 |title=The next generation of Jewish Humor in America |date=October 2007 |work=City Pages |accessdate=February 19, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130127101040/http://www.jewish-theatre.com/visitor/article_display.aspx?articleID=2517 |archivedate=January 27, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stand-up comedy===
Friedlander has performed stand-up comedy regularly throughout his entertainment career.&lt;ref name=NYT1/&gt;&lt;ref name=GOTHAMIST/&gt;&lt;ref name=PUNCH/&gt; He continued to perform stand-up several nights a week in [[New York City]] while working on the sitcom ''30 Rock''.&lt;ref name=NYT1/&gt;&lt;ref name=GOTHAMIST/&gt; Friedlander has stated that he is most relaxed when doing stand-up&lt;ref name=HOLLYREP/&gt; and that he considers stand-up to be his first true love,&lt;ref name=TORSTAR&gt;{{cite news |title=Judah Friedlander: Hats off to standup guy |first=Raju |last=Mudhar |url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/television/article/502734--judah-friedlander-hats-off-to-standup-guy |newspaper=Toronto Star |date=September 21, 2008 |accessdate=October 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; preferring it to acting.&lt;ref name=VULTURE&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vulture.com/2010/09/30_rocks_judah_friedlander.html |title=30 Rock’s Judah Friedlander on Karate and the Hat That Was Too Hot for NBC |author=Alexandra Martell |date=September 23, 2010 |work=Vulture |publisher=New York Magazine |accessdate=October 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated in 2012 that stand-up comedy is "still the most important thing I do from an artistic standpoint."&lt;ref name=CITYPAGES&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.citypages.com/dressingroom/2012/04/judah_friedlander_world_champion_standup.php |title=Judah Friedlander on comedy, ladies, and karate |author=Patrick Strait |date=April 9, 2012 |work=City Pages |accessdate=October 3, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918221026/http://blogs.citypages.com/dressingroom/2012/04/judah_friedlander_world_champion_standup.php |archivedate=September 18, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Friedlander has cited comedians [[Steven Wright]], [[Sam Kinison]] and [[John Mulrooney]] as influences.&lt;ref name=KANSAS&gt;{{cite news |title=After ‘30 Rock,’ comic Judah Friedlander is ready for new projects |first=Timothy |last=Finn |url=http://www.kansascity.com/2013/02/06/4050785/judah-friedlander-steps-off-the.html#storylink=cpy |newspaper=The Kansas City Star |date=February 6, 2013 |accessdate=October 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also says that [[Dave Attell]] is one of his favorite comics.&lt;ref name=KANSAS/&gt;

Friedlander's comedic performances often feature him making outrageous and bombastic claims about himself with a deadpan delivery.&lt;ref name=NYT1/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT2/&gt;&lt;ref name=TRIBLIVE/&gt;&lt;ref name=TORSTAR/&gt; Many of these claims are reflected in slogans displayed on the many [[trucker hats]] he wears — the most common being "World Champion", a slogan he has worn in various languages.&lt;ref name=NYT2/&gt;&lt;ref name=PLAIN/&gt;&lt;ref name=HOLLYREP/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYMAG/&gt;&lt;ref name=ANNARBOR/&gt;

One of his claims include being an expert in karate, having achieved an "extra-dark [[Black belt (martial arts)|black belt]]" in the sport.&lt;ref name=GOTHAMIST/&gt;&lt;ref name=THEGRID/&gt;&lt;ref name=WASHTIMES&gt;{{cite news |title=Get Out: Judah Friedlander |first=Mike |last=Riggs |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/nov/24/get-out-judah-friedlander/ |newspaper=The Washington Times |date=November 24, 2011 |accessdate=October 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, he authored the humor book ''How to Beat Up Anybody: An Instructional and Inspirational Karate Book by the World Champion''.&lt;ref name=NBCBIO/&gt;&lt;ref name=ANNARBOR/&gt; Friedlander's claims provide comedic irony when contrasted against his nonchalant attitude and physical appearance.&lt;ref name=NYT1/&gt;&lt;ref name=PLAIN/&gt; Friedlander wears large, thick-rimmed glasses, is often unshaven and is generally unkempt.&lt;ref name=NYT1/&gt;&lt;ref name=IFC/&gt;&lt;ref name=ANNARBOR/&gt;  His physique has also been described as "doughy".&lt;ref name=PLAIN/&gt;&lt;ref name=TRIBLIVE/&gt;

The look that Friedlander employs during his stand-up has also carried over into some of his television and film roles, including his ''30 Rock'' role as TV writer [[Frank Rossitano]].&lt;ref name=THEGRID/&gt;&lt;ref name=ANNARBOR/&gt; Frank is however much lazier than Friedlander's "World Champion" persona.&lt;ref name=THEGRID/&gt;&lt;ref name=TIMEOUT&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.timeoutchicago.com/arts-culture/comedy/15255886/judah-friedlander-at-mayne-stage-comedy-review |title=Judah Friedlander at Mayne Stage |author=Jenna Marotta |date=April 12, 2012 |work=Time Out Chicago |accessdate=October 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
