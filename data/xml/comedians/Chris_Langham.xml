'''Christopher Langham''' (born 14 April 1949) is an English writer, actor, and comedian, who was jailed for possession of [[child pornography]]. He is known for playing the cabinet minister Hugh Abbot in the [[BBC Four]] [[Situation comedy|sitcom]] ''[[The Thick of It]]'', and as presenter Roy Mallard in ''[[People Like Us (mockumentary)|People Like Us]]'', first on [[BBC Radio 4]] and later on its transfer to television on [[BBC Two]], where Mallard is almost entirely an [[unseen character]]. He subsequently created several spoof adverts in the same vein. He also played similar unseen interviewers in an episode of the television series ''[[Happy Families (1985 TV series)|Happy Families]]'' and in the film ''[[The Big Tease]]''. He is also known for his roles in the TV series ''[[Not the Nine O'Clock News]]'', ''[[Help (UK TV series)|Help]]'', ''[[Kiss Me Kate (TV series)|Kiss Me Kate]]'', and as the gatehouse guard in ''[[Chelmsford 123]]''. In 2006, he won [[BAFTA]] awards for ''The Thick of It'' and ''Help''.

On 2 August 2007, Langham was found guilty of 15 charges of downloading and possessing [[Copine scale#The SAP scale|level 5]] child pornography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1569291/Chris-Langham-freed-as-judge-accepts-appeal.html|title=Chris Langham freed as judge accepts appeal|author=Matthew Moore and agencies|date=14 November 2007|work=Telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/aug/02/ukcrime.media|title=Langham found guilty on child porn charges|author=Peter Walker|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Langham was jailed for ten months, reduced to six on appeal. He was made to sign the [[sex offenders' register]], and banned from working with children for 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/nov/20/ukcrime|title=Chris Langham says child porn viewings compassionate|first1=James|last1=Orr|first2=|last2=agencies|date=20 November 2007|publisher=|accessdate=3 January 2018|via=www.theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
The son of theatre director [[Michael Langham]] and actress [[Helen Burns]], Langham read English and Drama at [[University of Bristol|Bristol University]] before dropping out.&lt;ref name=DMail385913 /&gt;

=== Career ===
Langham began performing comedy and writing for [[Spike Milligan]].

One of his earliest breaks was as the sole British writer for ''[[The Muppet Show]]''. He also appeared as the "special guest star" in the nineteenth episode of the final season, when the scheduled guest, [[Richard Pryor]], was unable to make it to the recording; a script was hastily written in which "Chris the Delivery Boy" stood in for an absent celebrity. He received two awards from the [[Writers Guild of America Award|Writers Guild of America]] for his work on ''The Muppet Show.'' He also made a brief appearance as a police driver in ''[[The Pink Panther Strikes Again]]'' in 1976, opposite [[Peter Sellers]].

Langham was part of the original cast for the pilot for ''[[Not the Nine O'Clock News]]'' in 1979, written by [[Richard Curtis]]. The show was positioned as a comedy series which was neither ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'' nor ''[[The Two Ronnies]]''. Even after the original pilot was pulled from the schedules, Langham was retained for the first full series, billed equally with the then-unknown [[Mel Smith]], [[Pamela Stephenson]], and [[Rowan Atkinson]]. The first series did not rate as well as hoped, however, and it was felt that Langham was "too independent a spirit."&lt;ref name=DMail385913 /&gt; Langham took a part in ''[[Monty Python's Life of Brian]]'' as a [[centurion]], against the reaction to which{{clarify|date=July 2013}} Curtis had written a skit of the debate between [[John Cleese]] and [[Malcolm Muggeridge]]. Langham was upset at the inclusion of the sketch, which gave the team and producer [[John Lloyd (producer)|John Lloyd]] the excuse for his replacement by support player [[Griff Rhys Jones]]. Langham did not learn of the switch until the last day of filming when he heard the crew discussing the second series. The show only achieved cult status during its later series and, in subsequent compilation repeats, most of Langham's contributions have been cut, giving the impression that he was never a main cast member.

Langham went on to appear on Smith and Jones' own programme, ''[[Alas Smith and Jones]]'', playing an ineffectual panel show host. This character apparently inspired [[John Morton (writer)|John Morton]] to create the character of Roy Mallard, who was later to feature in his show ''[[People Like Us (mockumentary)|People Like Us]]''; Mallard was played both on radio and (offscreen) on television by Langham. Langham also played a fly-on-the-wall documentary interviewer very similar to Roy Mallard in ''[[Happy Families (1985 TV series)|Happy Families]]'' in 1985.

Also in 1979, Langham played [[Arthur Dent]] in the first professional stage version of ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Stage shows|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'', directed by [[Ken Campbell (actor)|Ken Campbell]]. He later returned to ''Hitchhiker's'', appearing as [[Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Prak|Prak]] in Above The Title Productions' [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases|''Tertiary Phase'']] radio series in 2004.

Langham narrated the 1984 radio series ''[[The History of Rock with Chris Langham]]'', in which Langham gave a comedic and somewhat fictitious account of the history of rock music. On 14 November 1985, Langham appeared as the narrator/reporter in "Roxanne", episode five of the BBC situation comedy ''Happy Families'', written by [[Ben Elton]]. In 1992, he appeared in the film ''[[Carry On Columbus]]''.

In addition to several one-man shows, Langham counts among his stage credits ''[[Les MisÃ©rables (musical)|Les MisÃ©rables]]'', in which he played ThÃ©nardier in 1996; ''[[Crazy for You (musical)|Crazy for You]]'', for which he received an [[Laurence Olivier Award|Olivier]] nomination; ''[[The Way of the World]]'', ''[[The Nerd]]'' and ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]''. He created the comic role of the Assassin in ''[[Blondel (musical)|Blondel]]'' (co-starring [[Paul Nicholas]]; by [[Tim Rice]] and [[Stephen Oliver (composer)|Stephen Oliver]]), and appears on the original cast album.

Langham wrote the [[BBC One]] sitcom ''[[Kiss Me Kate (TV series)|Kiss Me Kate]]'', in which he appeared alongside [[Caroline Quentin]] and [[Amanda Holden]]. In 2002 he wrote and starred in ''Bradford in My Dreams'', an adaptation of a short story by [[Lawrence Block]] for the BBC. On Radio 4 he narrated the series ''The Rapid Eye Movement'', which starred [[Martin Freeman]] as Chester Bennington, in whose head the entire series took place. In 2003 he directed the BBC TV comedy series ''[[Posh Nosh]].''

In 2003 and 2005, respectively, he portrayed the authors [[George Orwell]] and [[John Wyndham]] in the BBC [[docudrama]] ''George Orwell â€“ A Life In Pictures'' and the [[BBC Four]] documentary ''John Wyndham: the Invisible Man of Science Fiction''. He also appeared in the radio magazine satire ''[[The Sunday Format]]''.

He starred alongside co-writer [[Paul Whitehouse]] in ''[[Help (UK TV series)|Help]]'' on BBC Two in 2005, where he also appeared in the [[Armando Iannucci]] comedy ''[[The Thick of It]]'' in the same year. Langham was named Best Comedy Actor in the [[British Comedy Awards 2005|2005 British Comedy Awards]] and won the [[British Academy Television Awards 2006|2006 BAFTA]] Best Comedy Performance award for his role in ''The Thick Of It''. In November 2005 Langham wrote and starred in ITV pilot ''Seven Second Delay''.

He was a frequent guest on ''The Heaven and Earth Show'' and part of ''[[Bremner, Bird and Fortune]]'' writing team. In this series he has occasionally appeared as a civil servant discussing things with Bremner's [[Tony Blair]]. On radio, Langham has appeared as a panellist on the Radio 4 show ''[[Armando Iannucci's Charm Offensive]].''

Langham starred in a feature-length comedy drama ''Black Pond'', his first screen appearance since his release from prison.&lt;ref name=bignell&gt;{{cite news|last=Bignell|first=Paul|title=Chris Langham returns to screen with film role|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/chris-langham-returns-to-screen-with-film-role-2265783.html|accessdate=11 June 2011|newspaper=Independent|date=10 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Personal life ===
Langham's first marriage, to actress/singer [[Sue Jones-Davies]], produced three children, but broke up on his own admission due to his alcoholism.&lt;ref name=DMail385913&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-385913/Profile-Chris-Langham.html|title=Profile: Chris Langham|publisher=Daily Mail|date=2006-05-12|accessdate=2009-12-28 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Langham had two children  by his second wife, director Christine Cartwright.&lt;ref name=DMail385913 /&gt;

Langham sought counselling for alcohol and cocaine addiction, and was still undergoing therapy once a week as of 2006.&lt;ref name=DMail385913 /&gt; He used his experiences to co-write the BBC2 series ''[[Help (British TV series)|Help]]'', in which he portrayed a [[psychotherapist]], with friend [[Paul Whitehouse]]; and played a counsellor in sitcom ''Kiss Me Kate.''&lt;ref name=DMail385913 /&gt;

Despite his conviction and imprisonment for possession of child pornography (see next section), his marriage to Cartwright survived, and his wife and children continued to live with him in the family home in [[Cranbrook, Kent]] after his release.&lt;ref name=bignell&gt;{{cite news|last=Bignell|first=Paul|title=Chris Langham returns to screen with film role|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/chris-langham-returns-to-screen-with-film-role-2265783.html|accessdate=11 June 2011|newspaper=Independent|date=10 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise his three sons from his first marriage also stood by him.&lt;ref name=sears&gt;{{cite web|last=Sears|first=Neil|title=Prison bullies are making Langham's life hell, says wife|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-483076/Prison-bullies-making-Langhams-life-hell-says-wife.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Arrest and conviction ==
On 29 November 2005, Langham was arrested by [[Kent Police]] in connection with [[Operation Ore]], a British police operation into credit card customers paying to access indecent and abusive images of children on the internet. The arrest was first reported in the press on 16 December 2005, in response to which Langham's lawyer read a statement in which he said that he was innocent, and pointed out that he had not been charged.&lt;ref name="arrest"&gt;{{cite news|last=Staff writer|title=TV comedian in 'net porn' arrest|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4533812.stm|work= [[BBC News Online]]|date= 2005-12-16|accessdate= 2007-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 11 May 2006, he was charged with 15 counts of "making indecent images" (a legal term meaning to download and store indecent images as distinct from the act of photography) of children.&lt;ref name="charges"&gt;{{cite news|last=Staff writer|title=Comic actor charged over net porn|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4762401.stm|work=[[BBC News Online]]|date= 2006-05-11|accessdate=2007-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trial took place during July and August 2007. Part of Langham's defence to these charges in court was that they were research on a [[Voyeur|peeping tom]] character "Pedro" for a television comedy.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/kent/6913530.stm|title=BBC NEWS â€“ UK â€“ England â€“ Kent â€“ Co-star 'did not know about porn'|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Langham's former ''Help'' co-star/writer Paul Whitehouse confirmed that the character was referred to as a "peeping tom" who was prone to highly dubious sexual behaviour. Whitehouse stated that the character was not intended to be a paedophile, nor was he personally aware of Langham obtaining such material for the development of the programme's script.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk" /&gt; The prosecutor, Richard Barraclough QC, asked Mr Whitehouse, "Did Mr Langham ever discuss with you that he was undertaking any research for the shows?" "Not to my knowledge, no." Mr Whitehouse replied at Maidstone Crown Court.

Langham had paid with his credit card for access to a site entitled "European [[Lolita (term)|Lolita]] Sex" in 1999. On the evening that the public was made aware of the scope of Operation Ore, Langham had contacted police to report his "concern" about spam emails, with links to paedophile sites, which he said he was receiving. The prosecution said that he had contacted police because he had "panicked" and "wanted to give the impression of being a good citizen".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Langham: Caught in Operation Ore's net|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1559214/Langham-Caught-in-Operation-Ores-net.html|accessdate=31 December 2017|work=The Telegraph|date=2 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His trial also saw him accused of having sex with an under-age girl in upmarket hotels, his West End dressing room, his car and his home. The victim claimed this had started when she was 14 years old. Langham denied the charges and the jury accepted his account that he only had sex with her when she was 18, clearing him of six counts of indecent assault and two counts of buggery between January 1996 and April 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1563085/Chris-Langham-jailed-over-child-pornography.html|title=Chris Langham jailed over child pornography|first=Ben|last=Farmer|date=14 September 2007|publisher=|accessdate=3 January 2018|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 August 2007, Langham was found guilty on charges of possessing child pornography. He was sentenced to 10 months in prison and was placed on the [[sex offender registry|sexual offenders register]] for 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Megan|last= Levy|author2=Agencies|title= Chris Langham facing jail over child porn|url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/08/02/nlangham102.xml|work= [[The Daily Telegraph]]|date= 2007-08-03|accessdate= 2007-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before sentencing, the judge said that "some of the children viewed are clearly prepubescent... The worst video was 15 minutes long and it showed in quite graphic detail the sadistic brutalisation of an eight-year-old girl in the UK, with some serious sexual offences against her".&lt;ref name="bbc 6991550"&gt;{{cite news|last=Staff writer|title= Langham sentenced over child porn|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/kent/6991550.stm|work= [[BBC News Online]]|date=2007-09-14|accessdate=2007-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was released on 14 November 2007 after his sentence was reduced to six months on appeal. Dame Heather Steel, who gave the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|decision]] said that the court viewed Langham's explanation that he viewed the child porn for research as "highly improbable" but could not actually reject it, although he was still guilty of encouraging "despicable acts" through downloading the pornography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Outrage as Langham is freed early after child porn shame |url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=493535&amp;in_page_id=1770&amp;ct=5 |work= [[Daily Mail]]|date=2007-11-15|accessdate=2007-11-16 | location=London | first=Michael | last=Seamark}}&lt;/ref&gt; On his release, Langham stated, "My life has been ruined but my conscience is clear" and complained that the media "completely ignored" the court's "acceptance based upon all the evidence and expert opinion that I have no sexual interest in children".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/kent/7093905.stm|title=Langham wins early jail release|publisher=BBC|date=2007-11-14|accessdate=2007-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; A counter to his claims was provided by Paul Fotheringham, then the Deputy Superintendent of Kent Police, who told journalists after the trial in 2007, "Langham doesnâ€™t like the label, but I am satisfied that he is a paedophile".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/comedy/features/comic-release-is-it-time-to-forgive-chris-langham-1832809.html|title=Comic release: Is it time to forgive Chris Langham?|date=6 December 2009|publisher=|accessdate=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Post-release activities===
A few days after his release from prison, Langham was interviewed by celebrity psychologist [[Pamela Stephenson|Pamela Connolly]] (nÃ©e Stephenson), with whom he had worked on ''[[Not the Nine O'Clock News]]'', for her UK television series ''[[Shrink Rap (TV series)|Shrink Rap]]'', where he discussed being abused as an eight-year-old child, events which he said led to his trial and conviction. The interview was broadcast on [[More4]] on 15 January 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Staff writer |title= Chris Langham speaks out |url=http://library.digiguide.com/lib/uk-tv-highlight/Shrink+Rap-2362/Chat+Show/ |work=DigiGuide|date=2008-01-15 |accessdate=2008-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Langham was also invited to make a speech in front of the [[Oxford Union]] on 29 May 2008 but the invitation was then withdrawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sangwon Yoon and Sian Cox-Brooker |title=Tansey cancels Langham invite |url=http://www.cherwell.org/content.php?id=7307 |work=Cherwell |date=2008-04-24 |accessdate=2008-05-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080924163721/http://www.cherwell.org/content.php?id=7307 |archivedate=24 September 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, he was cast as the lead in ''[[Black Pond]]'', a low-budget British film directed by [[Tom Kingsley]] and [[Will Sharpe]].&lt;ref name="bp-indy"&gt;{{cite news|last=Macnab|first=Geoffrey|title=First Night: Black Pond, Raindance Festival, London|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/first-night-black-pond-raindance-festival-london-2364680.html|accessdate=7 October 2011|newspaper=The Independent|date=2011-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with ''[[The Guardian]]'' in September 2011, Langham stated that many people had suggested to him that he should work again but no one wanted to employ him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Aitkenhead|first=Decca|title=Chris Langham: 'Everyone wants to see me working again, but nobody wants to hire me'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/sep/25/chris-langham-interview|accessdate=26 September 2011|newspaper=The Guardian|date=2011-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewing his performance in ''Black Pond'' positively, ''[[The Independent]]'' commented, "whether it will rehabilitate him among casting agents and comedy show commissioners is another question".&lt;ref name="bp-indy" /&gt; The "Kino Digital" cinema in [[Hawkhurst]] had a screening of the film on 11 December 2011. Afterwards, Langham, a resident of the town, held a brief question-and-answer session to help promote the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Allen|first=Nina|title=Black Pond |url=http://www.ninaallan.co.uk/?p=289 |accessdate=27 August 2013|date=2011-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, he appeared with [[Billy Murray (actor)|Billy Murray]], [[Leslie Grantham]] and [[Crissy Rock]] in [[Richard John Taylor]]'s film drama ''Acceptance''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vimeo.com/69702153|title='Acceptance' UK TRAILER on Vimeo|date=22 February 2014|publisher=|accessdate=3 January 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222141838/http://vimeo.com/69702153|archivedate=22 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
