'''Beatrice Benaderet''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|b|ɛ|n|ə|ˈ|d|ɛr|ə|t}} {{respell|BEN|ə|DERR|ət}}; April 4, 1906 – October 13, 1968) was an American [[Radio comedy|radio]] and [[Television comedy|television]] actress, [[Voice acting|voice actress]] and [[Comedian|comedienne]]. Born in [[New York City]] and raised in [[San Francisco]], she began performing in [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]] [[theatre]] and radio before embarking on a [[Hollywood]] career that spanned over three decades. Benaderet first specialized in voiceover work in the [[Golden Age of Radio|golden age of radio]], appearing on numerous programs while working with noted comedians of the era such as [[Jack Benny]], [[Burns and Allen]], and [[Lucille Ball]], and her expertise in [[dialect]] and [[characterization]] led to her becoming [[Warner Bros.]]' leading voice of female characters in their animated cartoons of the early 1940s through the mid-1950s.

Benaderet was then a prominent figure on television in [[Sitcom|situation comedies]], first with ''[[The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show]]'' from 1950 to 1958, for which she earned two [[Emmy Award]] nominations for Best Supporting Actress. In the 1960s, she had regular roles in four series up until her death from [[lung cancer]] in 1968, including the commercial successes ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'', ''[[The Flintstones]]'', and her best known role as Kate Bradley in ''[[Petticoat Junction]]''. She has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] honoring her work in television.

===Voice acting===
Starting in 1943, Benaderet became [[Warner Bros.]]' primary voice of adult female supporting characters for their ''[[Merrie Melodies]]'' and ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' [[Animation|animated]] shorts.&lt;ref name="orsonwelles"/&gt; Her characterizations included an obnoxious teenaged version of [[Little Red Riding Hood]] in ''[[Little Red Riding Rabbit]]'' (1944),&lt;ref&gt;Goldmark &amp; Granata (2002), p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; [[Witch Hazel (Looney Tunes)|Witch Hazel]] in 1954's ''[[Bewitched Bunny]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animationmagazine.net/top-stories/which-witch-is-which/|title=Which Witch is Which?|first=Michael|last=Mallory|work=[[Animation Magazine]]|date=October 23, 2014|accessdate=July 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tweety]]'s owner "Granny" over several cartoons including the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film|Academy Award]]-winning ''[[Tweetie Pie]]'' (1947),&lt;ref name=nd/&gt; and Mama Bear in a series of [[The Three Bears (Looney Tunes)|Three Bears]] shorts, which animator [[Chuck Jones]] called one of his favorite portrayals.&lt;ref&gt;Furniss (2005), p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; Benaderet did not receive onscreen credit for her work, as she was employed by Warner Bros. as a freelance actor{{#tag:ref|Her occupation is listed as such in the 1940 U.S. census.&lt;ref name="forty"/&gt;|group="note"}} who voiced peripheral characters and, unlike [[Mel Blanc]], was not under contract with the studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cartoonresearch.com/index.php/mel-blanc-from-anonymity-to-offscreen-superstar-the-advent-of-on-screen-voice-credits/|title=Mel Blanc: From Anonymity To Offscreen Superstar (The advent of on-screen voice credits)|first=Keith|last=Scott|authorlink=Keith Scott (voice actor)|work=cartoonresearch.com|date=September 12, 2016|accessdate=July 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955, she was succeeded by [[June Foray]] as Warner's premier female voice artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nerdist.com/june-foray-animation-legend-rip/|title=Remembering Animation Legend June Foray (1917–2017)|first=Kyle|last=Anderson|work=[[The Nerdist]]|date=July 27, 2017|accessdate=July 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television===
Benaderet was Lucille Ball's first choice as [[Ethel Mertz]] for the sitcom ''[[I Love Lucy]]''; Ball said in a 1984 interview that she had "no other picture of anyone" for the part.&lt;ref name="K&amp;E"&gt;Edelman &amp; Kupferberg (1999), p.140-141&lt;/ref&gt; However, Benaderet had to turn down the offer since she was contracted to the television adaptation of ''[[The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show]]'', and [[Vivian Vance]] was eventually cast. She guest-starred on the January 21, 1952 first-season episode "Lucy Plays Cupid" as the character of Miss Lewis, a love-starved spinster neighbor.&lt;ref name="TCM"/&gt;

Benaderet continued her ''Burns &amp; Allen'' radio role of the Burns' neighbor Blanche Morton, Gracie's friend and staunchest supporter in her escapades.&lt;ref&gt;Irvin (2014), p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; She was the only secondary cast member who appeared in every episode,&lt;ref name="nd"/&gt; and the first six shows were shot live in New York, resulting in Benaderet commuting to and from Los Angeles where she was working several radio assignments at the time.&lt;ref name="gill"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yowpyowp.blogspot.com/2010/09/betty-rubble-meets-orson-welles.html|title=Oil Wells and Gold Mines|first=Alan|last=Gill|work=''source unknown; reprinted on yowpyowp.blogspot.com|date=July 29, 1963|accessdate=July 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blanche's husband Harry was played by four actors over the show's eight-year run; the last, [[Larry Keating]], was introduced on the October 5, 1953 fourth-season premiere when [[George Burns]] entered the set and halted a scene of an angered Blanche preparing to hit Harry with a book. Burns introduced Keating to Benaderet and the audience, and she broke character to exchange pleasantries with Keating.

Henning was again given free rein for a new show with no pilot needed, which he bestowed to colleague [[Jay Sommers]] due to his busy schedule.

===Film and other works===
Benaderet played bit parts in six motion pictures from 1946 to 1962, four of which were uncredited. She was chosen from two hundred actresses for the part of a government file clerk in [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Notorious (1946 film)|Notorious]]'' (1946) and completed filming in half an hour, but her scenes were cut from the final print.&lt;ref name="tod"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Radio-Life/40s/46/Radio-Life-1946-07-07.pdf|title=Nice Work...If You Can Get It|first=Tod|last=Fredericks|work=Radio Life|page=33|date=July 7, 1946|accessdate=August 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She told ''Radio Life'' magazine that year that after having struggled to remember her lines, "Mr. Hitchcock looked me right in the eye and asked 'You want to go back to radio?'

In 1945, Benaderet and fellow voice actresses [[Janet Waldo]] and [[Cathy Lewis]] were to appear on a televised fashion show on [[Don Lee (broadcaster)|Don Lee]]'s [[KCBS-TV|W6XAO]] network before the project fell through.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yowpyowp.blogspot.com/2010/02/happy-birthday-judy.html|title=Happy Birthday, Judy|work=yowpyowp.blogspot.com|date=February 4, 2010|accessdate=July 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Irving Taylor (songwriter)|Irving Taylor]]'s 1960 novelty album ''Drink Along with Irving'', she duetted with Elvia Allman and Mel Blanc, respectively, on tracks titled "Sub-Bourbon Living" and "Separate Bar Stools".&lt;ref&gt;Karol (2006), p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;

Benaderet and her first husband, actor [[Jim Bannon]], met while employed at [[KHJ (AM)|KHJ]] in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name="aaker345"/&gt; They married in August 1938 and had two children: Jack (1940–2017);&lt;ref name="THR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/jack-bannon-dead-lou-grant-actor-was-77-1052238|title=Jack Bannon, Actor on 'Lou Grant,' Dies at 77|first=Mike|last=Barnes|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=October 26, 2017|accessdate=October 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Maggie (b.
