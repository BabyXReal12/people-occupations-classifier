==Career==

===Early work===
After graduating from Oberlin, Helms began his comedy and acting career as a writer and performer with New York City [[sketch comedy]] bands, and studied [[improvisation]] with the [[Upright Citizens Brigade]] troupe.&lt;ref name="nbc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbc.com/The_Office/bios/ed_helms.shtml|work=NBC.com|title=''The Office'' Cast Biographies – Ed Helms|accessdate=October 11, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110329170504/http://www.nbc.com/The_Office/bios/ed_helms.shtml|archivedate=March 29, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Helms concurrently worked as a trainee [[film editor]] at [[Crew Cuts (company)|Crew Cuts]], a [[post-production]] facility in New York City. While doing so, he recorded some rough [[voiceover]] scratch tracks that eventually led to paying voiceover work, which in turn led to finding a talent agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Sternbergh | first = Adam| date = September 14, 2008| title = The Jerk: ''Daily Show'' alum and ''The Office'' star Ed Helms on the highs (and lows) of being obnoxious| url = http://nymag.com/arts/tv/profiles/50226|newspaper=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]| accessdate =October 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television===
Helms was performing comedy in [[New York City]] when, as he recalled in a 2005 interview, "''[[The Daily Show]]'' had a sort of open audition with a casting company that I had dealt with. I read for the part, and got it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecomical.com/features/ed_helms_interview.html |work=TheComical.com |title=Ed Helms on Politics, The Media and The Daily Show |date=2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724070121/http://www.thecomical.com/features/ed_helms_interview.html |archivedate=July 24, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his April 2002 to mid-2006 tenure on the satirical news program, Helms contributed "field reports" in addition to hosting various segments of the show, such as "[[The Daily Show recurring elements#Digital Watch|Digital Watch]]", "[[The Daily Show recurring elements#Ad Nauseam|Ad Nauseam]]", and "[[The Daily Show recurring elements#Mark Your Calendar|Mark Your Calendar]]". He has also contributed to the "[[The Daily Show recurring elements#This Week in God|This Week in God]]" segment. His 2005 segment "Battle of the Bulge", which focused on the wearing of Speedo bathing suits on the beaches of [[Cape May, New Jersey]], and his "Mass. Hysteria" segment, in which he reported criticism of Massachusetts when it became the first state to legalize gay marriage, are regarded by ''[[TV Guide]]'' as his signature segments on the program.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolph, Ileane (July 27, 2015). "Alumni Association: A roundup of ''The Daily Show''{{'}}s coolest Graduates". ''[[TV Guide]]''. pp 21-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Helms left the show in 2006, but has occasionally returned for brief appearances. On July&amp;nbsp;21, 2008 he returned for Obama Quest – a segment covering then-Senator [[Barack Obama]]'s trip to [[Iraq]]. He occasionally narrates the Prescott Group educational films on sister series ''[[The Colbert Report]]''. In late July 2006, [[NBC]] announced that Helms was added to the cast of the [[mockumentary]] ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]'', alongside fellow ''The Daily Show'' correspondent [[Steve Carell]], in a recurring role as [[Andy Bernard]], a nostalgic Cornell graduate who is obsessed with [[a cappella|a&amp;nbsp;cappella]] music. Helms was a series regular starting with the 3rd season.&lt;ref name="popwatch"&gt;{{cite web| author=Snierson, Dan | date = June 28, 2006| url = http://popwatch.ew.com/popwatch/2006/07/ed_helms_joins_.html| title = Ed Helms joins the cast of ''The Office''|work=Entertainment Weekly| accessdate =October 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; "He had so much in common with this character we wanted to create," recalled [[Paul Lieberstein]], a writer for the show who also plays [[Toby Flenderson]], the [[human resources]] representative at the Scranton branch of [[Dunder Mifflin]]. "I can't remember when they started merging."&lt;ref name="NYT 2012 story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Itzkoff|first=Dave|title=Ambitious, but in a Polite Sort of Way|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/11/movies/ed-helms-is-back-in-jeff-who-lives-at-home.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=March 11, 2012|accessdate=March 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Helms returned to ''The Daily Show'' on December 5, 2006, stating he had been gone because he was "undercover at a paper company in [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]]", an allusion to his stint on ''The Office''. In February 2007, NBC announced that Helms had been promoted to series regular, and in February 2010 Helms was added to the show's opening credits. Helms quickly became a solidifying part of the cast, and eventually came to be one of the show's producers. In June 2009, on a radio interview with [[National Public Radio]], Helms said that like his character, Andy Bernard, he is obsessed with a cappella music.

Helms has also appeared on such television shows as ''[[The Mindy Project]]'', ''[[Wilfred (U.S. TV series)|Wilfred]]'', ''[[NTSF:SD:SUV]]'', ''[[Tanner on Tanner]]'', ''[[Childrens Hospital]]'', ''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]]''  and ''[[Cheap Seats (TV series)|Cheap Seats]]'', and in various [[Comedy Central]] specials. He was the celebrity guest on the August 3, 2015 survival skills reality show ''[[Running Wild with Bear Grylls]]'', coming to grips with his fear of heights on the Colorado Mountains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Elizabeth|first1=Stormy|title=Running Wild with Bear Grylls Recap 8/3/15: Season 2 Episode 4 "Ed Helms"|url=http://www.celebdirtylaundry.com/2015/running-wild-with-bear-grylls-recap-8315-season-2-episode-4-ed-helms/|website=celebdirtylaundry.com|publisher=Celeb Dirty Laundry|accessdate=August 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He has done commercial [[voiceover]] work in campaigns for [[Burger King]], [[Doritos]], [[Hotels.com]], [[Sharp Aquos]] and Advair asthma medication, and he voices Neil the Angel, a character on [[Cartoon Network]]'s ''Weighty Decisions'' series. Helms plays guitar, banjo (which was shown in the commercial bumpers and on a ''What Up With That?'' sketch when he hosted ''Saturday Night Live'' in 2011), piano, and all three, as well as a [[sitar]], in some of his entertainment performances.

In August 2014, it was announced that Helms will star in [[Alejandro González Iñárritu]]'s new [[Starz]] television drama series ''The One Percent'', with [[Hilary Swank]] and [[Ed Harris]],&lt;ref&gt;Littleton, Cynthia (August 12, 2014).
