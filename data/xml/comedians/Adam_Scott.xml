Hallelujah! |publisher=Dreadcentral.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Leap Year (2010 film)|Leap Year]]'' (2010).

Scott's name appears next to [[Jon Hamm]]'s name in the film ''[[Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy|Anchorman]]'' in one of the broadcast's credits. In an appearance on G4's ''[[Attack of the Show!]]'' program on April 21, 2011, he confirmed that this was due to his and Hamm's friendship with producer [[Shauna Robertson]], who put their names in the credits as an Easter egg. He played Ted Hendricks, Walter Mitty's detestable corporate boss, in the 2013 remake of ''[[The Secret Life of Walter Mitty (2013 film)|The Secret Life of Walter Mitty]]''.
