'''Stephen Punt''' (born 15 September 1962)&lt;ref name="Directorcheck"&gt;[http://company-director-check.co.uk/director/904565415 Mr Stephen Mark Punt] company-director-check.co.uk. Retrieved 4 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; is a British writer, comedian and actor. Along with [[Hugh Dennis]], he is part of comedy double act [[Punt and Dennis]] and presenter of [[BBC Radio 4]] satirical news programme ''[[The Now Show]]''.  He is also a writer and programme associate for various television panel game shows, including ''[[Would I Lie to You? (TV series)|Would I Lie to You?]]'' and ''[[Mock the Week]]'', and is a writer for fellow comedians such as [[Rory Bremner]] and [[Jasper Carrott]].

==Early life==
Punt was educated at [[Whitgift School]]&lt;ref name="bucks"&gt;{{cite news|title=Whitgift's gifted wit|url=http://www.bucksfreepress.co.uk/news/558286.0/|publisher=[[Bucks Free Press]]|date=5 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[St Catharine's College, Cambridge]], where he read English. While at Cambridge, he joined [[Footlights]], where he first met comedy partner [[Hugh Dennis]] and was vice-president from 1983 to 1985 with [[Nick Hancock]] as president. He was in the writing team for three revues in a row.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cambridge Footlights Alumni 1980–1989|url=http://footlights.org/alumni-archive?name=1980-1989|publisher=Cambridge Footlights Alumni Official Website|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015035100/http://footlights.org/alumni-archive?name=1980-1989|archivedate=15 October 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
While at university Punt began writing for the [[BBC Radio 4]] series ''[[Week Ending]]''. Punt and Dennis later became resident guest comedians on shows presented by [[Jasper Carrott]], including ''Carrott Confidential'' and ''[[Canned Carrott]]'' with Punt contributing in the writing team as well. They also toured with Carrott as a live support act.

They were then recruited in 1988, along with fellow former Footlights member [[David Baddiel]] and his comedy partner [[Robert Newman (comedian)|Rob Newman]], to write and perform a [[satire|satirical]] sketch and stand-up show called ''[[The Mary Whitehouse Experience]]'' on [[BBC Radio 1]]. After three years, the show had proved such a big hit that it transferred to television. Punt and Dennis went on to perform in their own TV sketch show, ''[[The Imaginatively Titled Punt &amp; Dennis Show]]'', and co-wrote and starred with [[Nick Hancock]] in the sitcom, ''[[Me, You and Him]]''.

Punt has worked more as a writer, [[script editor]] and voice-over artist in recent years, though he has also performed with Dennis in ''[[It's Been a Bad Week]]'' for [[BBC Radio 2]]. The pair are also the main presenters and writers of [[BBC Radio 4]]'s ''[[The Now Show]]'' and the writers of Radio 4 sitcom ''[[The Party Line (radio)|The Party Line]]''. Punt, with [[Mark Tavener]], is co-writer of the 2007 Radio 4 series ''[[His Master's Voice (radio series)|His Master's Voice]]''. He also, with the help of [[Hugh Dennis]], [[Jon Holmes]], [[Marcus Brigstocke]] and [[Mitch Benn]] wrote ''The Now Show Book of World Records'', a follow-up book for ''The Now Show''.

Punt is a "programme associate" for the satirical programme ''[[Mock The Week]]'', in which Dennis is a regular team member. He has also written and provided additional material for ''[[Would I Lie to You? (TV series)|Would I Lie to You?]]''.

In 2008 Punt wrote the script for and performed in ''[[Rockford's Rock Opera]]'', a critically acclaimed ecological musical story created with school friend, Matthew Sweetapple, which has been published as an audiobook.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/dec/13/rockfords-rock-opera-review Review of '&amp;#39;Rockford's Rock Opera'&amp;#39;]. The Guardian. 13 December 2008. Retrieved on 2011-12-05.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article5251252.ece '&amp;#39;The Times'&amp;#39;: Review of '&amp;#39;Rockford's Rock Opera'&amp;#39;]. Entertainment.timesonline.co.uk (1 December 2011). Retrieved on 2011-12-05.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2011, he began as presenter of a new quiz show on [[BBC Radio 4]], called [[The 3rd Degree (radio series)|The 3rd Degree]]. Punt played [[Eric Idle]] in the BBC adaptation ''[[Holy Flying Circus]]'', covering the controversy surrounding the release of ''[[Monty Python's Life of Brian]]''.&lt;ref name="life of brian"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-13856561|title=BBC to dramatise Life of Brian controversy in new film|date=21 June 2011|publisher=BBC|accessdate=22 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike his comedy partner Dennis, Punt has mostly done screenwriting and script editing for various [[BBC]] shows, television programmes and documentaries. His credits include ''The Rory Bremner Show'', ''[[The Nearly Complete and Utter History of Everything (film)|The Nearly Complete and Utter History of Everything]]'', various episodes of ''[[Spitting Image]]'' and its retrospective documentary ''Best Ever Spitting Image'', ''[[Baddiel's Syndrome]]'' and ''[[Horrible Histories (2009 TV series)|Horrible Histories]]''.

On 3 January 2013 Punt appeared on ''[[Celebrity Mastermind]]''. His specialist subject was [[Tony Hancock]] and his chosen supported charity was [[Stillbirth and Neonatal Death Society|SANDS]]. Punt won the contest.

During 2016 Punt toured with the production of ''[[The Rocky Horror Show]]'' in the role of the narrator. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/leisure/stage/14171116.Steve_Punt_joins_The_Rocky_Horror_Show_at_Mayflower/ Steve Punt joins The Rocky Horror Show at Mayflower (From Daily Echo)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
