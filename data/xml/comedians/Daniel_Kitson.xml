'''Daniel Kitson''' (born 2 July 1977) is an English comedian.

==Career==
Kitson was born in [[Denby Dale]], West Yorkshire,&lt;ref name="Times"&gt;{{cite news|title=Comedy: Out on his own|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/comedy-out-on-his-own-jghjcqhc8zn|accessdate=29 November 2017|work=The Sunday Times|date=3 November 2002|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Independent" /&gt; to a lecturer father and primary school headteacher mother,&lt;ref name="Independent" /&gt; and began performing comedy at the age of 16.&lt;ref name="Independent"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/features/daniel-kitson-the-hirsute-of-happiness-666592.html |title=The Independent: The hirsute of happiness . |accessdate=12 May 2009 |location=London |date=23 August 2001 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090616004603/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/features/daniel-kitson-the-hirsute-of-happiness-666592.html |archivedate=16 June 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a pupil at [[Scissett Middle School]] and [[Shelley College]] in Yorkshire, England. Kitson subsequently studied drama at Roehampton Institute, now known as [[Roehampton University]].&lt;ref name="Independent" /&gt;&lt;ref name=foster&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comedyawards.co.uk/comedyshow.asp |title= 31 Years of Discovering Comedy Genius |accessdate= 16 July 2011 |publisher=Fosters Edinburgh Comedy}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has a stutter.&lt;ref name="gothamist"&gt;{{cite news|last=Del Signore|first=John|title=Theater Review: Daniel Kitson's It's Always Right Now, Until It's Later|url=http://gothamist.com/2012/01/08/theater_review_daniel_kitsons_its_a.php|publisher=Gothamist|date=12 January 2012|accessdate=19 March 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120109032140/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/08/theater_review_daniel_kitsons_its_a.php|archivedate=9 January 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was nominated for the 2001 [[Perrier Comedy Award]] at the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] for his show ''Love, Innocence and the Word Cock'' before winning it in 2002 for the show ''Something''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ifcomedy.com/past-winners.html |title=If.Comedy Awards (formerly Perrier Awards) Past Winners and Nominees |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5gm7Q0N7B?url=http://ifcomedy.com/past-winners.html |archivedate=14 May 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IMBDbio" /&gt;

As well as stand up, Kitson has written and performed "story shows". The first was ''A Made Up Story'' at the [[2003 Edinburgh Festival Fringe]],&lt;ref name="Guardian2003"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2003/jul/27/edinburghfestival2003.features |title= The Guardian: I want to tell you a story. |accessdate= 12 May 2009 |location=London |first=Stephanie |last=Merritt |date=27 July 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by ''Stories For the Wobbly-Hearted'' at the [[Melbourne International Comedy Festival]] in 2005. The latter show opened at the [[Traverse Theatre]] for the [[2005 Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] and won a [[Scotsman Fringe First Award]]. In 2006, Kitson took ''Stories for the Wobbly Hearted'' to the Brits Off Broadway Festival in New York.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britsoffbroadway.com/wobbly_stories.htm Wobbly Stories]&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2006 the story show made up one half of his Regents Park Open Air Theatre appearance, where Kitson's stories were accompanied by songs from Gavin Osborn. His story show, ''C-90'', opened at the Traverse for the [[2006 Edinburgh Festival Fringe]]. It was awarded both a ''Fringe First'' and [[The Stage]] [[Stage Awards for Acting Excellence|Acting Award]] for Best Solo Show.

In 2007, Kitson toured ''It's The Fireworks Talking'' and the story show ''C-90'' in the UK, Australia, New York and Paris. There was a second Open Air Theatre show in June 2007. Kitson also complemented his Australian tour of ''C-90'' with a loosely structured stand up show titled ''At 10&amp;nbsp;pm, Daniel Kitson Will Be Drinking Tea and Blowing Minds'', a reference to a line from the movie ''[[Dazed and Confused (film)|Dazed and Confused]]''.

''It's The Fireworks Talking'' won Kitson the [[Barry Award (for comedy)|Barry Award]] – named after [[veteran]] Australian comedian [[Barry Humphries]] – at the 2007 [[Melbourne International Comedy Festival]]. ''C90'' was awarded an [[Brighton and Hove Argus|Argus]] Angel Award at the 2007 [[Brighton Festival]].

In the first half of 2008 Kitson toured his show ''The Impotent Fury of the Privileged''. He played work-in progress gigs in January and early February before presenting the show at 28 dates during May &amp; June. The show was released as an audio download in January 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2017/01/16/26630/at_last..._daniel_kitson_releases_his_2008_show|title=At last...

In July 2008 he began previews of his Edinburgh Festival show, ''66A Church Road: A Lament, Made Of Memories And Kept In Suitcases.'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royalexchange.co.uk/play.asp?playid=293 Royal Exchange] Listing&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 Kitson performed two new shows: 'We Are Gathered Here' &amp; 'The Interminable Suicide of Gregory Church', the latter of which was toured in late 2010 and the first half of 2011. Prior to this in early 2010, Kitson also did a short UK tour of '66a Church Road  – A Lament Made of Memories and Kept in Suitcases' that he initially performed in Edinburgh in 2008 (and then took to Australia.)

In January 2012, his show "It’s Always Right Now, Until it’s Later" played at the St. Ann's Warehouse in Brooklyn, NY.

In March 2012, Kitson took a brand new stand-up show, ''Where Once Was Wonder'', on a work-in-progress tour around the UK before touring it in Australia and returning for the Edinburgh Fringe in August. The new show comprises all new material and is made up of three stories about "the impossible".&lt;ref name=BristolTimes&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bristoltimes.com/theatre-and-films/daniel-kitson-where-once-was-wonder-work-in-progress-tobacco-factory-060312 |title= Bristol Times: Daniel Kitson – Where Once Was Wonder (WiP) @ Tobacco Factory |accessdate= 12 March 2012 |publisher=BristolTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 he took his new stand-up show entitled 'After the Beginning. Before the End' on a UK tour and also played a few European dates.

Kitson debuted his new play Mouse: The Persistence of an Unlikely Thought at [[Liverpool Everyman]] in 2016. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.everymanplayhouse.com/whats-on/mouse-the-persistence-of-an-unlikely-thought&lt;/ref&gt;

Kitson is debuting his first stand-up comedy in over four years at [[The Roundhouse]] in July 2017 before taking it to The [[Royal Exchange, Manchester]].

==Television==
[[File:DanielKitsonJumping.jpg|thumb|200x200px|Daniel Kitson]]
Kitson appeared in an episode of ''[[That Peter Kay Thing]]'', [[That Peter Kay Thing#The Arena|The Arena]], and as the recurring character [[Characters in Phoenix Nights#Spencer|Spencer]] in ''[[Peter Kay's Phoenix Nights]].''

In 2007 clips of Daniel Kitson's standup were shown on the one-off Channel 4 show [[100 Greatest Stand-Ups]] where he came 27th.&lt;ref name="100GS"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0996593/ |title= 100 hundred greatest standups. IMDB. |accessdate= 12 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an updated version of the poll in 2010, he was voted 23rd. Chris Addison commented that 'Kitson is the finest comedian of his generation'. Stewart Lee also commented, after seeing a stand-up set by Kitson, that he saw stand-up 'about as good as it could get'.

Whilst in his teens, he appeared as a contestant on the ITV quiz show [[Blockbusters (UK game show)|Blockbusters]].&lt;ref name="IMBDbio"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1146744/bio |title= IMDB biography of Daniel Kitson. |accessdate= 12 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kitson voices an "alley rat" in the pilot episode of the [[Kristen Schaal]] and [[Kurt Braunohler]] comedy "[[Penelope: Princess of Pets]]" which was aired in 2010 by Channel 4.&lt;ref name="Apiary"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theapiary.org/archives/2009/05/penelope_prince_2.html |title= The Apiary – Penelope: Princess of Pets Pilot. |accessdate= 22 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BCG"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comedy.org.uk/guide/tv/penelope_princess_of_pets |title= British Comedy Guide – Penelope: Princess of Pets. |accessdate= 22 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Radio==
In 2006, Kitson began presenting his own weekly music-based radio show called ''The Listening Club''. The show, broadcast live 1&amp;nbsp;am to 4&amp;nbsp;am on Monday nights / Tuesday mornings from London's community arts radio station [[Resonance FM]], mainly involves music from his own collection (some played directly from his [[iPod]]), and occasional clips of comedy. In between tracks he talks about the music, tells anecdotes, and responds to the SMS text messages and [[e-mails]] that are sent in throughout the show. There were six shows in the original January / February 2006 run, with further installments in October 2006 and February 2007. Kitson returned to Resonance FM in early 2013 on Tuesdays from midnight to 2:30&amp;nbsp;am. The show is only broadcast once with no repeat or accompanying podcast to ensure that audiences hear the show only once to make it more special, he also requests that no one record the show. The show returned in September 2016 under the title "Captain Bang Bang's Magic Castle" for a run of five weeks. This run of shows was subject to a number of mishaps which resulted in Kitson only broadcasting for one hour of the fifth show due to missing his train and missing the entire final show due to not being able to enter the Resonance FM radio station. As with the original run the show was not archived or repeated. In 2018 it was announced that for three weeks in May, Kitson would host an early morning weekday show on Resonance FM called “A Reason To Wake Up”. 

Kitson had originally begun doing radio shows in Australia during the 2005 [[Melbourne International Comedy Festival]], on [[Melbourne]]-based community station [[3RRR]]. These continued, twice weekly, in 2006 and 2007. The Australian programmes are usually co-hosted with a comedian friend. Co-hosts have included Courteney Hocking, [[David O'Doherty]], Andrew McClelland and Steve Hall of [[We Are Klang]].

He has appeared on the [[BBC Radio 4]] show ''[[Loose Ends (radio)|Loose Ends]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/2208132.stm  |title= BBC 'Protests greet male Perrier shortlist' article. |accessdate= 13 May 2009 |date=21 August 2002 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kitson appears in Episode 2 of the ''[[Flight of the Conchords]]'' radio series.

He also can be heard on the BBC Radio 4 Program, ''[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b072n5xc Tim Key Delves Into Daniil Kharms and That's All]''&lt;ref name="radio2"&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/comedy/conchords.shtml BBC Radio 2 Comedy]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Film ==
Kitson performs the part of a bus driver in the film [[Dog Eat Dog (2001 film)|''Dog Eat Dog'' (2001)]]
