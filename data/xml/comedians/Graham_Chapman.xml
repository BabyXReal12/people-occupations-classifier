'''Graham Arthur Chapman''' (8 January 1941 – 4 October 1989) was an English comedian, writer, actor, author, and one of the six members of the British surreal comedy group [[Monty Python]]. He played authority figures such as the [[The Colonel (Monty Python)|Colonel]] and the lead role in two Python films, ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail|Holy Grail]]'' (1975) and ''[[Monty Python's Life of Brian|Life of Brian]]'' (1979).

Chapman was born in [[Leicester]] and was raised in [[Melton Mowbray]]. He enjoyed science, acting, and comedy, and after graduating from [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge]], and [[St Bartholomew's Hospital Medical College]], he turned down a career as a doctor to be a comedian. Chapman eventually established a writing partnership with [[John Cleese]], which reached its critical peak with Monty Python in the 1970s. He subsequently left Britain for [[Los Angeles]], where he attempted to be a success on American television, speaking on the college circuit and producing the pirate film ''[[Yellowbeard]]'' (1983), before returning to Britain in the early 1980s.

In his personal life, Chapman was openly [[homosexual]] and a strong supporter of [[gay rights]], and was in a relationship with [[David Sherlock]]. He was an [[alcoholic]] during his time at Cambridge and the Python years, quitting shortly before working on ''Life of Brian''. He later became an enthusiast and patron of the [[Dangerous Sports Club]]. Chapman died of [[tonsil cancer]] on 4 October 1989, on the eve of Monty Python's 20th anniversary, and his life and legacy were commemorated at a private memorial service at St Bartholomew's with the other five Pythons.

== Early life and education ==
[[File:Graham Chapman blue plaque Melton.jpg|thumb|left|A [[blue plaque]] at Melton Mowbray Grammar School (now [[King Edward VII School (Melton Mowbray)|King Edward VII School]]), which Chapman attended]]
Graham Arthur Chapman was born on 8 January 1941 at the Stoneygate Nursing Home, [[Stoneygate]], [[Leicester]], the son of policeman Walter Chapman and Edith Towers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/55386|title=Chapman, Graham (1941–1989), comedian and writer|publisher=oup.com|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/55386|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had an elder brother, John, who was born in 1936.{{sfn|McCabe|2005|p=3}} One of Chapman's earliest memories was seeing the remains of Polish airmen who had suffered an aeroplane accident near Leicester, later saying the horrific sights of this remained in his memory.{{sfn|McCabe|2005|pp=1,7}}

Chapman was educated at [[King Edward VII School (Melton Mowbray)|Melton Mowbray Grammar School]]. He showed a strong affinity for science, sports and amateur dramatics, and was singled out for attention when a local paper reviewed his performance of [[Mark Antony]] in [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]].''{{sfn|McCabe|2005|p=10}} Graham and John Chapman were both avid fans of radio comedy, being especially fond of ''[[The Goon Show]]''{{sfn|McCabe|2005|p=11}} and [[Robert Moreton]]'s skill of telling jokes the wrong way round and reversing punchlines. Biographer Jim Yoakum said "the radio shows didn't necessarily make him laugh."{{sfn|Chapman|Yoakum|2006|p=xvii}}

In 1959, Chapman began to study medicine at [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge]].{{sfn|McCabe|2005|p=18}} He joined the [[Cambridge Footlights]], where he first began writing with [[John Cleese]].{{sfn|McCabe|2005|p=23}} Following graduation, Chapman joined the Footlights show "Cambridge Circus" and toured [[New Zealand]], deferring his medical studies for a year.{{sfn|McCabe|2005|p=43}} After the tour, he continued his studies at [[St Bartholomew's Medical College]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.qmul.ac.uk/alumni/notablealumni/28914.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312063307/http://www.qmul.ac.uk/alumni/notablealumni/28914.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=12 March 2012 |title=Entertainment, Queen Mary, University of London |publisher=Queen Mary University of London |accessdate=14 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but became torn between whether to pursue a career in medicine or acting. His brother John later said, "He wasn't ever driven to go into medicine ... it wasn't his life's ambition."{{sfn|McCabe|2005|p=48}}
{{-}}

== Career ==

=== Pre-Python career ===
Following their Footlights success, Chapman and Cleese began to write professionally for the [[BBC]], initially for [[David Frost]] but also for [[Marty Feldman]]. Frost had recruited Cleese, and in turn Cleese decided he needed Chapman as a sounding board.{{sfn|McCabe|2005|p=56}} Chapman also contributed sketches to the radio series ''[[I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again]]'' and wrote material on his own and with [[Bill Oddie]].{{sfn|McCabe|2005|p=57}} He wrote for ''[[The Illustrated Weekly Hudd]]'' (starring [[Roy Hudd]]), ''[[Cilla Black]]'', ''[[This Is Petula Clark]]'', and ''[[This Is Tom Jones]]''.{{sfn|Chapman|1980|p=136}} Chapman, Cleese, and [[Tim Brooke-Taylor]] later joined Feldman in the television comedy series ''[[At Last the 1948 Show]]''.{{sfn|McCabe|2005|p=67}} It was Chapman's first significant role as a performer as well as a writer{{sfn|McCabe|2005|p=67}} and he displayed a gift for [[deadpan]] comedy (such as in the sketch "[[The Minister Who Falls to Pieces]]") and imitating various British [[dialects]].{{sfn|Wilmut|1980|p=148}} The series was the first to feature Chapman's sketch of wrestling with himself.{{sfn|McCabe|2005|p=67}}

Despite the show's success, Chapman was still unsure about abandoning his medical career. In between the two series of ''At Last the 1948 Show'' he completed his studies at St Bartholomew's, and became professionally registered as a doctor.{{sfn|McCabe|2005|p=68}} Chapman and Cleese also wrote for the long-running television comedy series ''[[Doctor in the House (TV series)|Doctor in the House]]'',{{sfn|McCabe|2005|p=88}} and both appeared on a one-off television special, ''[[How to Irritate People]]'' alongside Brooke-Taylor and [[Michael Palin]].{{sfn|McCabe|2005|p=89}} One of Cleese and Chapman's sketches, featuring a used car salesman refusing to believe a customer's model had broken down, became the inspiration for the [[Dead Parrot sketch]].{{sfn|McCabe|2005|p=90}} Chapman also co-wrote several episodes of ''Doctor in the House''{{'s}} follow up, ''[[Doctor in Charge]]'', with [[Bernard McKenna (writer)|Bernard McKenna]].{{sfn|McCall|2013|p=15}}

=== Monty Python ===
{{main|Monty Python}}
[[File:Graham Chapman Colonel.jpg|thumb|Chapman ended several ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'' sketches mid-flow dressed as [[The Colonel (Monty Python)|The Colonel]], complaining they were "too silly".&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt;]]
In 1969, Chapman and Cleese joined the other Pythons, Palin, [[Eric Idle]], [[Terry Jones]] and [[Terry Gilliam]], for their sketch comedy show ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus|Flying Circus]]''.{{sfn|McCabe|2005|pp=92&amp;ndash;94}} The group's writing was split into well-defined teams, with Chapman collaborating almost exclusively with Cleese.{{sfn|McCabe|2005|p=98}} Chapman was particularly keen to remove stereotypical [[punch line|punchlines]] in sketches{{sfn|McCabe|2005|p=99}} and created [[The Colonel (Monty Python)|The Colonel]], who would stop them in mid-flow by saying they were "too silly".&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;{{cite news|first=William|last=Langley|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/comedy/10948113/Monty-Python-Will-the-wrinkly-revolutionaries-have-the-last-laugh.html|title=Monty Python : Will the wrinkly revolutionaries have the last laugh?|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=[[telegraph Media Group]]|location=London, England|date=5 July 2014|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the pair were officially equal partners, Cleese later thought that Chapman contributed comparatively little in the way of direct writing, saying "he would come in, say something marvellous and then drift off in his own mind."{{sfn|McCabe|2005|p=103}} The other Pythons have said that Chapman's biggest contribution in the writing room was an intuition for what was funny.{{sfn|McCabe|2005|p=103}} Gilliam later recalled that "Graham would do the nudge that would push it into something extraordinary."{{sfn|McCabe|2005|pp=139–140}} The show was an immediate success, and Chapman was delighted to learn that medical students at St Bartholomew's crowded round the television in the bar to watch it.{{sfn|McCabe|2005|p=107}} Chapman was frequently late for rehearsing or recording,{{sfn|McCabe|2005|p=139}} leading to the other Pythons calling him "the late Graham Chapman".{{sfn|Chapman|Yoakum|2006|p=53}}

Chapman's main contribution to the "[[Dead Parrot sketch]]", derived from the ''How to Irritate People'' piece and involving a customer returning a faulty toaster, was "How can we make this ''madder''?", turning the toaster into a dead Norwegian Blue parrot. Cleese later said he and Chapman believed that "there was something very funny there, if we could find the right context for it".{{sfn|McCabe|2005|pp=90–91}} The group felt that Chapman had the best acting skills in the group. Cleese complimented Chapman by saying that he was "particularly a wonderful actor".{{sfn|McCabe|2005|p=154}}

Chapman played the lead role in two Python films, ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail|Holy Grail]]'' and ''[[Monty Python's Life of Brian|Life of Brian]]''. He was chosen to play the lead in ''Holy Grail'' because of the group's respect towards his straight acting skills, and because the other members wanted to play lesser, funnier characters.{{sfn|McCabe|2005|pp=185–186}} Chapman did not mind being filmed fully nude in front of a crowd in ''Life of Brian'', but the scene, filmed in [[Tunisia]], caused problems with the female [[Muslim]] extras.{{sfn|Chapman|Yoakum|2006|p=17}}

=== Other work ===
Chapman and [[Douglas Adams]] wrote a pilot for a TV series in 1975, ''[[Out of the Trees]]'', but it received poor ratings after being broadcast at the same time as ''[[Match of the Day]]'' and only the initial episode was produced.{{sfn|McCabe|2005|p=195}} In 1978, Chapman co-wrote the comedy film ''[[The Odd Job]]'' with McKenna, and starred as one of the main characters. Chapman wanted his friend [[Keith Moon]] to play a co-lead role alongside him, but Moon could not pass an acting test, so the part went to [[David Jason]] who had previously appeared on ''[[Do Not Adjust Your Set]]'' with Pythons Idle, Jones, and Palin. The film was moderately successful.{{sfn|McCabe|2005|pp=207, 208}}

During the 1970s, Chapman became increasingly concerned about the Python's income and finances. He moved to [[Los Angeles]] in the late 1970s to avoid British [[income tax]].{{sfn|McCabe|2005|p=200}} He guest-starred on several television series including ''[[The Big Show (TV series)|The Big Show]]''.{{sfn|McCall|2013|p=75}}

In 1976, Chapman began writing a pirate film, ''[[Yellowbeard]]'' (1983), which came out of conversations between Chapman and Moon while in Los Angeles. Moon had always wanted to play [[Long John Silver]], so Chapman began to write a script for him.{{sfn|McCabe|2005|p=228}} Moon died in 1978 and the work stalled, eventually being rewritten by McKenna, then by [[Peter Cook]].{{sfn|McCabe|2005|pp=234–235}} The film, which starred Chapman as the eponymous pirate, also featured appearances from Cook, [[Marty Feldman]], Cleese, Idle, [[Spike Milligan]], and [[Cheech &amp; Chong]].{{sfn|McCabe|2005|p=236}} It marks the last appearance of Feldman, who suffered a fatal heart attack in December 1982.{{sfn|McCabe|2005|p=238}} The project was fraught with financial difficulties, and at times there was not enough money to pay the crew.{{sfn|McCabe|2005|p=237}} It was released to mixed reviews. [[David Robinson (film critic)|David Robinson]], reviewing the film in ''[[The Times]]'' said "the Monty Python style of comic anarchy requires more than scatology, rude words and funny faces."{{sfn|McCall|2013|p=97}}

Chapman published his memoirs, ''[[A Liar's Autobiography]]'', in 1980, choosing the title because he said "it's almost ''impossible'' to tell the truth".{{sfn|Chapman|Yoakum|2006|p=15}} He returned to Britain permanently after ''Yellowbeard'' was released. He became involved with the [[extreme sport]]s club [[Dangerous Sports Club]], which popularised [[bungee jumping]]. Chapman was scheduled to perform a bungee jump himself, but it was cancelled due to safety concerns.{{sfn|McCabe|2005|p=239}}

=== Final years ===
After reuniting with the other Pythons in the film ''[[Monty Python's The Meaning of Life|The Meaning of Life]]'' (1983), Chapman began a lengthy series of U.S. college tours, talking about the Pythons, the Dangerous Sports Club and Moon, among other subjects.{{sfn|McCabe|2005|p=239}} ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' creator and Python fan [[Lorne Michaels]] persuaded Chapman to star in ''[[The New Show]]''.{{sfn|McCabe|2005|p=241}}

In 1988, Chapman appeared in the [[Iron Maiden]] video "[[Can I Play with Madness]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Drew| last=Magary|url=http://deadspin.com/5849204/a-not-at-all-homoerotic-tribute-shoulder-pads|title=A Not-At-All Homoerotic Tribute To Shoulder Pads|website=[[Deadspin]]|publisher=[[Fusion Media Group]]|location=Doral, Florida|date=October 13, 2011|accessdate=May 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, he starred in a pilot of a proposed television series, ''[[Jake's Journey]]'', but financial problems prevented a full series from being made.{{sfn|McCabe|2005|p=242}} Chapman was intended to be cast in the ''[[Red Dwarf]]'' episode "[[Timeslides]]", but died before shooting began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/guide/index.cfm?seriesID=3&amp;sectionID=behind-the-scenes&amp;subsectionID=casting|title=Behind the Scenes – Series III|publisher=Red Dwarf (official website)|accessdate=17 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
[[File:Graham Chapman's house in Highgate.jpg|thumb|left|Chapman lived in this house in [[Highgate]] with his partner [[David Sherlock]] during the late 1960s.]]
Chapman first met his long term partner [[David Sherlock]] in [[Ibiza]] in 1966.{{sfn|McCabe|2005|p=60}} He later described realising he was [[homosexual]] as "an important moment in my life".{{sfn|McCabe|2005|p=64}} He told close friends about his relationship, including Cleese and Feldman the following year.{{sfn|McCabe|2005|p=73}} Chapman and Sherlock moved to [[Belsize Park]] in 1968,{{sfn|McCabe|2005|p=84}} and the pair enjoyed visiting gay clubs in Central London.{{sfn|McCabe|2005|p=85}}

Chapman first disclosed his homosexuality in public on British [[jazz]] musician [[George Melly]]'s television show in 1972, becoming one of the first celebrities to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=OPINION: Don't Take It The Wrong Way: Homosexuality in Comedy|url=http://www.thegayuk.com/opinion-dont-take-it-the-wrong-way-homosexuality-in-comedy/|accessdate=10 April 2017|work=The Gay UK|date=13 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Chapman|Yoakum|2006|p=18}} He was a vocal spokesman for gay rights, supporting the [[Gay Liberation Front]].{{sfn|McCabe|2005|p=111}} In 1971, Chapman and Sherlock [[gay adoption|adopted]] John Tomiczek as their son. Chapman met Tomiczek when the adolescent was a run-away from [[Liverpool]] aged 14. After discussions with Tomiczek's father, it was agreed that Chapman would become Tomiczek's legal guardian.{{sfn|McCabe|2005|pp=128, 130}} Tomiczek later became Chapman's business manager and died of a heart attack in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Ken|last=Levy|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/jul/01/graham-chapman-monty-python-star-and-me|title=Graham Chapman: an unlikely friendship with a Monty Python star|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|location=London, England|date=1 July 2014|accessdate=17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, Chapman supported the newspaper ''[[Gay News]]'', which listed him as one of the publication's "special friends" in recognition.{{sfn|McCall|2013|p=26}}

Later, during his college tour, Chapman mentioned that a television audience member had written to the Pythons to complain about them having a gay member, adding that the Bible said any man who lies with a man should be taken out and [[stoning|stoned]]. With other Pythons already aware of his [[sexual orientation]], Idle jokingly replied that they had found the perpetrator and killed him.{{sfn|Perry|2007|p=107}} Both Sherlock and Tomiczek remained a constant in Chapman's life. In the mid-1980s, having resettled in Britain, the three moved to [[Maidstone]], [[Kent]].{{sfn|McCabe|2005|p=246}}

Chapman took up [[pipe smoking]] aged 15, which became a lifelong habit.{{sfn|McCabe|2005|p=16}} He began drinking heavily during his time at Cambridge and St Bartholomew's, favouring [[gin]]. By the time Monty Python went on tour in 1973, Chapman's drinking had begun to affect his performance, causing him to miss cues to go on stage.{{sfn|McCabe|2005|p=163}} He stopped drinking in Christmas 1977, concerned at being able to act in ''Life of Brian'' successfully, and remained sober for the rest of his life.{{sfn|McCabe|2005|p=201}}

== Death ==
In 1988, Chapman made a routine visit to a dentist, who found a small, but malignant tumour on one of his tonsils, leading to both being removed via a [[tonsillectomy]].{{sfn|McCabe|2005|p=243}} The following year, the cancer had spread into Chapman's spinal cord, where another tumour was surgically removed. Chapman had several [[chemotherapy]] treatments and surgeries during the final months of his life, but ultimately the cancer was declared inoperable.{{sfn|McCabe|2005|pp=244&amp;ndash;245}} According to his brother, Chapman was visibly upset by the death of his mother that July, by which time he was [[terminal illness|terminally ill]].{{sfn|McCabe|2005|p=246}} Shortly afterwards, Chapman filmed scenes for the 20th anniversary of the first broadcast of ''Flying Circus'', the final time he appeared on television.{{sfn|McCabe|2005|p=252}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/3093564.stm |publisher=BBC News  | title=Monty Python reunion 'unlikely' | date=9 September 2003 | accessdate=4 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapman died on 4 October 1989 in [[Maidstone Hospital]].{{sfn|McCabe|2005|p=251}} At the time of his death, he was being visited by Sherlock, brother John and his sister-in-law, and fellow Pythons Palin and Cleese, the latter of whom had to be led out of the room to deal with his grief.{{sfn|McCabe|2005|p=251}}{{sfn|Marasco|Shuff|2010|p=94}} [[Peter Cook]] had intended to visit, but arrived too late and was visibly shaken by the news.{{sfn|McCabe|2005|p=251}} Chapman's death occurred on the eve of the twentieth anniversary of the first broadcast of ''Flying Circus'', and Jones called it "the worst case of party-pooping in all history".{{sfn|Marasco|Shuff|2010|p=94}}

=== Memorial service ===
{{quotebox|width=400px|quote="I guess we're all thinking how sad it is that a man of such talent, of such capability for kindness, of such unusual intelligence, should now so suddenly be spirited away ... Well, I feel that I should say, "''Nonsense. Good riddance to him, the freeloading bastard, I hope he fries!''" And the reason I feel I should say this is he would never forgive me if I didn't, if I threw away this glorious opportunity to shock you all on his behalf. Anything for him, but mindless good taste."|source=[[John Cleese]] at Graham Chapman's memorial service{{sfn|Marasco|Shuff|2010|p=94}}}}
The five surviving Python members had decided to stay away from Chapman's private funeral to prevent it from becoming a [[media circus]] and to give his family some privacy. They sent a wreath in the shape of the Python foot with the message: "To Graham from the other Pythons with all our love. PS: Stop us if we're getting too silly".{{sfn|McCall|2013|p=143}} [[The Rolling Stones]] also sent a floral arrangement, saying "Thanks for all the laughs".{{sfn|McCall|2013|p=143}}

A private memorial service for Chapman was held at St Bartholomew's on 3 December, two months after his death. The service began with a chorus of the hymn "[[Jerusalem (hymn)|Jerusalem]]" sung in [[Engrish]] with a mock [[Standard Chinese|Chinese accent]].{{sfn|McCall|2013|p=145}} Cleese delivered a eulogy to Chapman with a shock humour that he believed Chapman would have appreciated,{{sfn|Marasco|Shuff|2010|p=94}} and later became the first person at a televised British memorial service to say "fuck".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Life of Python|year=2006|first=George|last=Perry|publisher=Pavilion Publishing|p=200|isbn=978-1-86205-762-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Palin also delivered a eulogy to Chapman, as did Idle, quipping that Chapman had decided to die rather than listen to Palin once again. Idle also led the other surviving Pythons and Chapman's close friends and family in a rendition of the song "[[Always Look on the Bright Side of Life]]" from ''The Life of Brian''. Idle closed his remarks by saying: "I'd just like to be the last person at this meeting to say 'fuck'."{{sfn|McCall|2013|p=145}}

Ten years after Chapman's death, his ashes were first rumoured to have been "[[space burial|blasted into the skies in a rocket]]" with assistance from the [[Dangerous Sports Club]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://newsvote.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/590559.stm | title=Python star Chapman's flying ashes |website=[[BBC News]] | publisher=[[BBC]]| location=London, England| date=4 January 2000 | accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a second rumour, Chapman's ashes had been scattered on the mountains of [[Snowdonia]], [[Wales]], where he had visited regularly as a climber. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Nathan|last=Bevan|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/lifestyle/showbiz/life-times-monty-pythons-terry-1843865|title=The life and times of Monty Python’s Terry Jones|work=[[Wales Online]]|publisher=[[Media Wales|Media Wales Ltd.]]|location=Cardiff, Wales|date=5 March 2011|accessdate=13 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Chapman's death, reformations of the Pythons have included an urn said to contain his [[cremation|ashes]]. At the 1998 Aspen Comedy Arts festival, the urn, brought onstage by a stiff English butler, was "accidentally" knocked over by [[Terry Gilliam]], spilling the "ashes" on-stage. The apparently [[Cremation|cremated]] remains were then removed with a dust-buster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/63795.stm | title=And now for something completely different (and plenty that isn't) |publisher=BBC News  | date=9 March 1998| accessdate=1 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Idle recalled meeting Sherlock saying "I wish he [Chapman] was here now" and Sherlock replied "Oh, but he is. He's in my pocket!"{{sfn|Chapman|Yoakum|2006|p=54}} Asteroid [[9617 Grahamchapman]], named in Chapman's honour, is one of six asteroids named after the Python members.

In 1997, Sherlock allowed Jim Yoakum to start the ''Graham Chapman Archives''. Later that year, the novel ''Graham Crackers: Fuzzy Memories, Silly Bits, and Outright Lies'' was released. It is a semi-sequel to ''A Liar's Autobiography'', with Chapman's works compiled by Jim Yoakum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Graham|last=Chapman|editor-first=Jim|editor-last=Yoakum|url=https://books.google.com/?id=8xGcAAAACAAJ|title=Graham Crackers: Fuzzy Memories, Silly Bits, and Outright Lies|publisher=Career Press|location=Wayne, New Jersey|year=1997|isbn=978-1-564-14334-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A compendium of writings, ''Calcium Made Interesting: Sketches, Letters, Essays &amp; Gondolas'', also compiled and edited by Yoakum was published in 2005 in association with the David Sherlock and John Tomiczeck trust.{{sfn|Chapman|Yoakum|2006|p=iv}} In 2000, Chapman's play ''O Happy Day'' was performed by [[Dad's Garage Theatre Company]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], with the assistance of Cleese and Palin.{{sfn|McCall|2013|p=207}} In 2006, the album and DVD ''Looks Like Another Brown Trouser Job'' was released, featuring a college lecture recorded in April 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Alan|last=Campbell|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/looks-like-another-brown-trouser-job-mw0000411429|title=Looks Like Another Brown Trouser Job|website=[[AllMusic]]|publisher=[[All Media Network, LLC]]|location=San Francisco, California|accessdate=3 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Angel Inn, Highgate, N6.jpg|thumb|A blue plaque has been placed at The Angel, [[Highgate]], [[North London]], in commemoration of Chapman.]]
In June 2011, it was announced that Cleese, Jones, Gilliam and Palin would perform in a [[3-D film|3-D]] animated version of Chapman's memoir ''[[A Liar's Autobiography|A Liar's Autobiography: Volume VI]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Michael|last=Cieply|title=This May Be Something Completely Different|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/27/movies/graham-chapman-tribute-from-monty-python.html?ref=arts|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=New York Times Company|location=New York City|date=June 26, 2011|accessdate=June 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Co-director Jeff Simpson worked closely with Chapman's estate and the surviving Python members to "get this exactly right".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-13939238|title=Monty Python members reunite for Graham Chapman film|publisher=BBC News|date=28 June 2011|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film, titled ''[[A Liar's Autobiography: The Untrue Story of Monty Python's Graham Chapman]]'', was shown at the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2012 and premiered in the UK the following month as part of the [[BFI London Film Festival]]. The voices of Cleese, Gilliam, Jones, and Palin were spliced into commentary recorded by Chapman reading from his memoir and taped shortly before his death. The film's official trailer quotes Chapman saying, "This is the best film I've been in since I died."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=John|last=Hartl|url=https://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/movies/a-liars-autobiography-8212-the-untrue-story-of-monty-pythons-graham-chapman-the-title-says-it-all/|title=‘A Liar’s Autobiography — The Untrue Story of Monty Python’s Graham Chapman’: The title says it all|newspaper=[[Seattle Times]]|publisher=[[The Seattle Times Company]]|location=Seattle, Washington|date=November 1, 2012|accessdate=July 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2012, a British Comedy Society [[blue plaque]], to commemorate Chapman, was unveiled at The Angel pub in [[Highgate]], [[North London]], by Jones, Palin, [[Barry Cryer]], [[Ray Davies]] and [[Carol Cleveland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Tara |last=Brady|url=http://www.hamhigh.co.uk/news/heritage/monty_python_graham_chapman_honoured_with_plaque_on_highgate_pub_1_1508901|title=Monty Python Graham Chapman honoured with plaque on Highgate pub|newspaper=Hampstead Highgate Express|publisher=[[Archant|Archant Limited]]|location=London, England|date=7 September 2012|accessdate=14 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Palin said, "Highgate was his patch and he should be celebrated because he was a very good, brilliant, funny, nice, wise, kind man, who occasionally drank too much."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Mark| last=Brown|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/sep/06/monty-python-graham-chapman-plaque?newsfeed=true|title=Monty Python's Graham Chapman honoured with (unofficial) blue plaque|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|location=London, England|date=September 6, 2012|accessdate=July 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2014 a green plaque funded by [[Leicestershire County Council]] was placed on Chapman's former home in Burton Road, [[Melton Mowbray]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leicestershire-30413224|title=Plaque for Monty Python star Graham Chapman's former home|publisher=BBC News|date=10 December 2014|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2015 a blue plaque at the entrance of Chapman's old school, [[King Edward VII School, Melton Mowbray|King Edward VII School]] was reported as stolen, but was later found inside the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.meltontimes.co.uk/whats-on/arts/monty-python-star-s-plaque-is-found-at-former-melton-school-1-7123927|title=Monty Python star’s plaque is found at former Melton school|newspaper=Melton Times|publisher=Johnston Publishing Ltd.|location=Melton Mowbray, England|date=18 December 2015|accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2017 the plaque was relocated to Melton Mowbray town centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.meltontimes.co.uk/whats-on/arts/monty-python-star-s-plaque-finds-a-new-home-in-melton-1-7864755|title=Monty Python star’s plaque finds a new home in Melton|newspaper=Melton Times|publisher=Johnston Publishing Ltd.|location=Melton Mowbray, England|date=14 March 2017|accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
