'''Robin McLaurin Williams''' (July 21, 1951 – August 11, 2014) was an American actor and comedian. Born in [[Chicago]], Williams started as a stand-up comedian in [[San Francisco]] and [[Los Angeles]] in the mid-1970s. He is credited with leading San Francisco's comedy renaissance.&lt;ref name=Nachman/&gt; After rising to fame playing an alien named Mork in the TV sci-fi sitcom series ''[[Mork &amp; Mindy]]'', Williams established a career in both stand-up comedy and feature film acting. He was known for his improvisational skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/norm-macdonald-met-robin-williams-funniest-man-world/story?id=24950575|title = When Norm Macdonald Met Robin Williams – 'The Funniest Man in The World'|last = Kahn|first = Mattie|date = August 12, 2014|publisher = ABC News|accessdate = October 19, 2014|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140813070539/http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/norm-macdonald-met-robin-williams-funniest-man-world/story?id=24950575|archivedate = August 13, 2014|deadurl = no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bradenton.com/2014/08/11/5298510/robin-williams-funniest-man-alive.html |title=Robin Williams, 'funniest man alive,' dead at 63 |last=Raab |first=Lauren |date=August 11, 2014 |work=The Bradenton Herald |accessdate=October 19, 2014 |agency=Los Angeles Times |last2=Parker |first2=Ryan |last3=Loomis |first3=Nicky |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6TSIUf17i?url=http://www.bradenton.com/2014/08/11/5298510_robin-williams-funniest-man-alive.html?rh=1 |archivedate=October 20, 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his first starring film role in ''[[Popeye (film)|Popeye]]'' (1980), Williams starred or co-starred in various films that achieved both critical acclaim and financial success, including ''[[Good Morning, Vietnam]]'' (1987), ''[[Dead Poets Society]]'' (1989), ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'' (1992), ''[[The Birdcage]]'' (1996), and ''[[Good Will Hunting]]'' (1997). He also starred in widely acclaimed films such as ''[[The World According to Garp (film)|The World According to Garp]]'' (1982), ''[[Moscow on the Hudson]]'' (1984), ''[[Awakenings]]'' (1990), ''[[The Fisher King]]'' (1991), ''[[What Dreams May Come (film)|What Dreams May Come]]'' (1998), ''[[One Hour Photo]]'' (2002), and ''[[World's Greatest Dad]]'' (2009), as well as box office hits such as ''[[Hook (film)|Hook]]'' (1991),  ''[[Mrs. Doubtfire]]'' (1993), ''[[Jumanji]]'' (1995) and ''[[Night at the Museum]]'' (2006).

Williams won the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|1997 Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] for his performance as psychologist Sean Maguire in ''Good Will Hunting''. He also received two [[Primetime Emmy Award|Emmy Awards]], seven [[Golden Globe Award]]s, two [[Screen Actors Guild Award]]s, and four [[Grammy Award]]s throughout his career.&lt;!--Please do not change "committed suicide" - See the proposal and discussion on the Talk page first.--&gt; On August 11, 2014, Williams committed suicide at his home in [[Paradise Cay, California]], at the age of 63.&lt;ref name="MartinN"/&gt;  His wife attributed his suicide to Williams' struggle with [[Lewy body]] disease.&lt;!--

THIS CANNOT BE LINKED, because she used the term Lewy body disease, the autopsy used the term ''diffuse Lewy body dementia'' (not a commonly used term) and we can't know whether she/they meant [[Lewy body dementia]] (a word she never used), [[dementia with Lewy bodies]], or [[Parkinson's disease dementia]] which is due to Lewy bodies.

In 1973, Williams attained a full scholarship to the [[Juilliard School]] ([[List of Juilliard School people|Group 6]], 1973–1976) in New York City. He was one of 20 students accepted into the freshman class and one of two students to be accepted by [[John Houseman]] into the Advanced Program at the school that year; the other was [[Christopher Reeve]]. [[William Hurt]] and [[Mandy Patinkin]] were also classmates.&lt;ref name=Maslon&gt;Maslon, Laurence, and Kantor, Michael.

{{quote|He wore tie-dyed shirts with tracksuit bottoms and talked a mile a minute. I'd never seen so much energy contained in one person. He was like an untied balloon that had been inflated and immediately released. I watched in awe as he virtually caromed off the walls of the classrooms and hallways. To say that he was "on" would be a major understatement.&lt;ref name="reeve"/&gt;}}

Williams and Reeve had a class in dialects taught by Edith Skinner, who Reeve said was one of the world's leading voice and speech teachers. Skinner had no idea what to make of Williams, added Reeve, as he [Williams] could instantly perform in many dialects, including Scottish, Irish, English, Russian, and Italian. Their primary acting teacher was [[Michael Kahn (theatre director)|Michael Kahn]], who was "equally baffled by this human dynamo," notes Reeve. Williams already had a reputation for being funny, but Kahn sometimes criticized his antics as simple stand-up comedy. In a later production, Williams silenced his critics with his convincing role of an old man in ''The Night of the Iguana,'' by [[Tennessee Williams]]. "He simply ''was'' the old man," observed Reeve. "I was astonished by his work and very grateful that fate had thrown us together."&lt;ref name="reeve"/&gt;

Williams and Reeve remained close friends until Reeve's death in 2004. Reeve had struggled for years with being [[quadriplegic]] after a horse-riding accident.&lt;ref name="reeve"/&gt;{{rp|16}} Son Zak Williams remembered their friendship as having been like "brothers from another mother."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2014/11/23/robin-williams-son-remembers-his-dad-and-christopher-reeve-friendship/ "Robin Williams' son remembers his dad and Christopher Reeve's friendship"], ''Fox News'', November 23, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Williams paid many of Reeve's medical bills and gave financial support to his family.&lt;ref name="reeve"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/11027923/Robin-Williams-obituary.html |title=Robin Williams – obituary |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=August 12, 2014|accessdate=August 12, 2014|archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/6TTTp9htz?url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/11027923/Robin-Williams-obituary.html|archivedate = October 20, 2014|deadurl = no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Stand-up comedy===
[[File:Robin Williams in Camp Phoenix.jpg|thumb|Williams performing stand-up comedy at a [[United Service Organization|USO]] show on December 20, 2007]]
After his family moved to [[Marin County]], Williams began his career doing stand-up comedy shows in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] in the mid-1970s. His first performance took place at the [[Holy City Zoo]], a comedy club in San Francisco, where he worked his way up from tending bar to getting on stage.&lt;ref name=Zehme/&gt; In the 1960s, San Francisco was a center for a rock music renaissance, hippies, drugs, and a sexual revolution, and in the 1970s, Williams helped lead its "comedy renaissance," writes critic Gerald Nachman.&lt;ref name=Nachman&gt;Nachman, Gerald. ''Seriously Funny: The Rebel Comedians of the 1950s and 1960s'', Pantheon, N.Y. (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6}}  Williams says he found out about "drugs and happiness" during that period, adding that he saw "the best brains of my time turned to mud."&lt;ref name=Maslon/&gt;

He moved to Los Angeles and continued doing stand-up shows at various clubs, including the Comedy Club, in 1977, where TV producer [[George Schlatter]] saw him. Schlatter, realizing that Williams would become an important force in show business, asked him to appear on a revival of his [[Rowan &amp; Martin's Laugh-In|''Laugh-In'']] show.  The show aired in late 1977 and became his debut TV appearance.&lt;ref name=Maslon/&gt; Williams also performed a show at the LA [[The Improv|Improv]] that same year for [[Home Box Office]].&lt;ref&gt;video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH7crqRvhhc&amp;list=WL&amp;index=2 "Young Robin Williams at the Los Angeles Improv, 1977]&lt;/ref&gt; While the ''Laugh-In'' revival failed, it led Williams into a career in television, during which period he continued doing stand-up at comedy clubs, such as the [[Roxy Theatre (West Hollywood)|Roxy]], to help him keep his improvisational skills sharp.&lt;ref name=Maslon/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;video: {{YouTube|id=LsIh5z7oYyY&amp;t=2m25s|title=Robin Williams at the Roxy, 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Early influences====
Williams has credited other comedians with having influenced and inspired him, including [[Jonathan Winters]], [[Peter Sellers]], [[Nichols and May]], and [[Lenny Bruce]].  He attributed their influence to their ability to attract a more intellectual audience by using a higher level of wit.&lt;ref name=Nachman/&gt;{{rp|43}} He also liked [[Jay Leno]] for his quickness in ad-libbing comedy routines and [[Sid Caesar]], whose acts he felt were "precious."&lt;ref name=Grobel&gt;{{cite news | work = [[Playboy]] | date = January 1992 | first = Lawrence | last = Grobel | title = Playboy Interview:Robin Williams }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jonathan Winters became his "idol" early in life; Williams at age eight first saw him on television and paid him homage in interviews throughout his career.&lt;ref name=Nachman/&gt;{{rp|259}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/12/jonathan-winters-dead_n_3070474.html|title = Jonathan Winters Dead: 'Mork and Mindy' Star Dies At Age 87|date = April 12, 2013|work = Huffington Post|accessdate = October 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams was inspired by Winters's ingenuity, realizing, he said, "that anything is possible, that anything is funny{{nowrap|. . .}} He gave me the idea that it can be free-form, that you can go in and out of things pretty easily."&lt;ref name=Nachman/&gt;{{rp|260}}

During an interview in [[London]] in 2002, he told &lt;!-- Not knighted until 2008. --&gt;[[Michael Parkinson]] that Peter Sellers was an important influence, especially his multi-character roles in ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]'', stating, "It doesn't get better than that." British comedy actors [[Dudley Moore]] and [[Peter Cook]] were also among his influences, he told Parkinson.&lt;ref&gt;video: {{cite interview |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LaJDOD5cJI |last=Williams |first=Robin |interviewer=[[Michael Parkinson]] |title=Robin Williams, Parkinson interview 2002 |accessdate=September 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Robin Williams Aviano.jpg|thumb|Williams performing at a [[United Service Organizations]] holiday show held for the [[Aviano Air Base]] community on December 22, 2007]]
Williams was also influenced by [[Richard Pryor]]'s fearless ability to talk about his personal life on stage, with subjects including his use of drugs and alcohol, and Williams added those kinds of topics during his own performances. By bringing up such personal matters as a form of comedy, he told Parkinson, it was "cheaper than therapy" and gave him a way to release his pent-up energy and emotions.&lt;ref name=Nachman/&gt;{{rp|121}}

====Televised live performances====
Williams won a [[Grammy Award]] for the recording of his 1979 live show at the Copacabana in New York, "Reality...What a Concept". Some of his later tours, after he became a TV and film star, include ''An Evening With Robin Williams'' (1982–83), ''Robin Williams: At The Met'' (1986) and ''Robin Williams: Live on Broadway'' (2002). The latter broke many long-held records for a comedy show. In some cases, tickets were sold out within thirty minutes of going on sale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lee|first1=Carter|title=Shazbot Robin Williams: Because we did, in fact, love him|url=http://www.commdiginews.com/entertainment/media-news-ureviews/shazbot-robin-williams-because-we-did-in-fact-love-him-23602/|website=commdiginews.com|accessdate=August 12, 2014|publisher = Communities Digital News|date = August 11, 2014|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140812224009/http://www.commdiginews.com/entertainment/media-news-reviews/shazbot-robin-williams-because-we-did-in-fact-love-him-23602/|archivedate = August 12, 2014|deadurl = no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, Williams released ''[[A Night at the Met]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Benedictus|first1=Leo|title=Comedy gold: Robin Williams' A Night at the Met|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/dec/06/robin-williams-night-met-comedy-gold|accessdate=December 3, 2014|work=The Guardian|date=December 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a six-year break, in August 2008, Williams announced a new 26-city tour titled "Weapons of Self-Destruction". He said that this was his last chance to make jokes at the expense of the Bush administration, but by the time the show was staged, only a few minutes covered that subject. The tour started at the end of September 2009 and concluded in New York on December 3, and was the subject of an HBO special on December 8, 2009.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

====Hardships in performing stand-up====
Williams said that partly due to the stress of performing stand-up, he started using drugs and alcohol early in his career. He further said that he never drank nor took drugs while on stage but occasionally performed when hung over from the previous day. During the period he was using [[cocaine]], he said that it made him paranoid when performing on stage.&lt;ref name=Grobel/&gt;

Williams once described the life of stand-up comedians:
{{quote|It's a brutal field, man. They burn out. It takes its toll. Plus, the lifestyle—partying, drinking, drugs. If you're on the road, it's even more brutal. You gotta come back down to mellow your ass out, and then performing takes you back up. They flame out because it comes and goes. Suddenly they're hot, and then somebody else is hot. Sometimes they get very bitter. Sometimes they just give up. Sometimes they have a revival thing and they come back again. Sometimes they snap. The pressure kicks in. You become obsessed and then you lose that focus that you need.&lt;ref name=Nachman/&gt;{{rp|34–35}}}}

Some, such as the critic [[Vincent Canby]], were concerned that his monologues were so intense that it seemed as though at any minute his "creative process could reverse into a complete meltdown."&lt;ref name="When the Laughter Stops"&gt;{{cite book | title=Robin Williams: When the Laughter Stops 1951–2014 | first=Emily | last=Herbert | publisher=John Blake Publishing Ltd. | location=London | date=November 15, 2014 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9DpUCgAAQBAJ | isbn=9781784183004 | oclc=889523094 | accessdate=August 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His biographer Emily Herbert described his "intense, utterly manic style of stand-up [which sometimes] defies analysis ... [going] beyond energetic, beyond frenetic .. [and sometimes] dangerous ... because of what it said about the creator's own mental state."&lt;ref name="When the Laughter Stops"/&gt;

Williams felt secure he would not run out of ideas, as the constant change in world events would keep him supplied.&lt;ref name=Grobel/&gt; He also explained that he often used [[Free association (psychology)#Characteristics|free association]] of ideas while improvising in order to keep the audience interested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media | via=YouTube | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LaJDOD5cJI&amp;t=14m20s | |date=2002 | title=Robin Williams interview with Sir Michael Parkinson, 2002 | accessdate=August 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He noted that the competitive comedy club atmosphere could cause problems. For example, some comedians accused him of intentionally copying their jokes, although Williams strongly denied ever doing so.&lt;ref name=Grobel/&gt; [[Whoopi Goldberg]] defended him, explaining that it is difficult for comedians not to pick up and reuse another comedian's material, and that it is done "all the time."&lt;ref name="rs comedy"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/features/robin-williams-fears-of-a-clown-20140811 | title = Robin Williams: Fears of a Clown | first = Jeff | last = Giles | date = February 21, 1991 | accessdate = August 17, 2014 | work = [[Rolling Stone]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; He later avoided going to performances of other comedians to deter similar accusations.&lt;ref name="rs comedy"/&gt;

During a ''[[Playboy (magazine)|Playboy]]'' interview in 1992, Williams was asked whether he ever feared losing his balance between his work and his life. He replied, "There's that fear—if I felt like I was becoming not just dull but a rock, that I still couldn't speak, fire off or talk about things, if I'd start to worry or got too afraid to say something ... If I stop trying, I get afraid." While he attributed the recent suicide of novelist [[Jerzy Kosiński]] to his fear of losing his creativity and sharpness, Williams felt he could overcome those risks. For that, he credited his father for strengthening his self-confidence, telling him to never be afraid of talking about subjects which were important to him.&lt;ref name=Grobel/&gt;

==== Accusations of plagiarism ====
Rumors have circulated accusing Williams of stealing material from other comics, especially in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/rambling-reporter/robin-williams-accused-stealing-jokes-comedy-tell-all-book-1045397|title=Robin Williams Accused of Stealing Jokes in Comedy Tell-All Book|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=July 20, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kempa.com/robin-williams-prince-of-thieves/|title=Robin Williams: Prince of Thieves {{!}} Kempa.com|website=www.kempa.com|language=en-US|access-date=July 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Brenner]] claims that he confronted Williams personally and threatened him with bodily harm if he heard Williams utter another one of his jokes.&lt;ref name="Comedy at the Edge"&gt;{{cite book|title=Comedy at the Edge|author=Richard Zoglin|publisher=Bloomsbury USA|year=2008|isbn=978-1582346243}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/07/joke-stealing-comedy-conan-twitter/399800/|title=In Conan O'Brien Versus Twitter Comedians, Whose Joke Is It Anyway?|last=Sims|first=David|date=July 28, 2015|work=The Atlantic|access-date=July 20, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the ''[[Laugh-In]]'' revival and appearing in the cast of ''[[The Richard Pryor Show]]'' on [[NBC]], Williams was cast by [[Garry Marshall]] as the alien Mork in a 1978 episode of the  TV series ''[[Happy Days]]'', "[[My Favorite Orkan]]".&lt;ref name=Maslon/&gt;&lt;ref name="actors"&gt;{{cite episode | title = Robin Williams | series = Inside the Actors Studio | season = 7 | number = 710 | airdate = June 10, 2001 | network = Bravo | url = http://www.bravotv.com/Inside_the_Actors_Studio/guest/Robin_Williams | credits = James Lipton (host) | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070204093734/http://www.bravotv.com/Inside_the_Actors_Studio/guest/Robin_Williams | archivedate = February 4, 2007 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sought after as a last minute cast replacement for a departing actor, Williams impressed the producer with his quirky sense of humor when he sat on his head when asked to take a seat for the audition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Robin Williams Biography |url=http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biographies/robin-williams.html |publisher=Biography Channel |accessdate=September 27, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716212135/http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biographies/robin-williams.html |archivedate=July 16, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As Mork, Williams improvised much of his dialogue and physical comedy, speaking in a high, nasal voice.

Although he portrayed the same character as in ''Happy Days'', the series was set in the present in Boulder, Colorado, instead of the late 1950s in [[Milwaukee]]. ''Mork &amp; Mindy'' at its peak had a weekly audience of 60 million and was credited with turning Williams into a "superstar."&lt;ref name=Maslon/&gt; According to critic [[James Poniewozik]], the series was especially popular among young people as Williams became a "man and a child, buoyant, rubber-faced, an endless gusher of invention."&lt;ref name=Corliss&gt;{{cite journal |last=Corliss |first=Richard |url=http://time.com/3110842/robin-williams-the-heart-of-comedy/ |title=Robin Williams: The Heart of Comedy |magazine=Time |date=August 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s, Williams began to reach a wider audience with his stand-up comedy, including three [[HBO]] comedy specials, ''Off The Wall'' (1978), ''An Evening with Robin Williams'' (1983) and ''Robin Williams: Live at the Met'' (1986). Also in 1986, Williams co-hosted the [[58th Academy Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=O'Connor |first1=John J |title=The Academy Awards Ceremony |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/26/movies/the-academy-awards-ceremony.html |accessdate=August 12, 2014 |newspaper=The New York Times|date = March 26, 1986|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140812213954/http://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/26/movies/the-academy-awards-ceremony.html|archivedate = August 12, 2014|deadurl = no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Williams was also a regular guest on various talk shows, including ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]''&lt;ref&gt;video clip; {{YouTube|iqdSagycCWc|"Robin Williams on Johnny Carson's Tonight Show – 1991"}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'', on which he appeared 50 times. Letterman, who knew Williams for nearly 40 years, recalls seeing him first perform as a new comedian at [[The Comedy Store]] in Hollywood, where Letterman and other comedians had already been doing stand-up. "He came in like a hurricane," said Letterman, who said he then thought to himself, "Holy crap, there goes my chance in show business."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2014/08/19/david_letterman_s_robin_williams_tribute_the_late_show_host_remembers_when.html|title = Letterman Remembers the First Time He Met Robin Williams|date = August 19, 2014|accessdate = October 23, 2014|website = Slate|last = Lockett|first = Dee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His stand-up work was a consistent thread through his career, as seen by the success of his one-man show (and subsequent DVD) ''Robin Williams: Live on Broadway'' (2002). He was voted 13th on [[Comedy Central]]'s list "100 Greatest Stand-ups of All Time" in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://us.imdb.com/title/tt0429332/ | title = Comedy Central Presents: 100 Greatest Stand-Ups of All Time | publisher=Internet Movie Database |accessdate=December 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film actor===
{{see also|Robin Williams filmography}}

The first film role credited to Robin Williams is a small part in the 1977 low-budget comedy ''[[Can I Do It... 'Til I Need Glasses?]]''. His first major performance is as the title character in ''[[Popeye (film)|Popeye]]'' (1980). There, Williams showcased the acting skills previously demonstrated in his television work; and the film's commercial disappointment was not blamed upon his role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://articles.philly.com/2014-08-13/news/52732960_1_golden-globe-aladdin-role |  title = Robin Williams, 63, comic genius | first = Steven | last = Rea | date = August 13, 2014 | accessdate = August 18, 2014 | work = The Philadelphia Inquirer }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VF-20140812"&gt;{{cite web |last=Spitznagel |first=Eric |title=Popeye Is the Best Movie Robin Williams Ever Made |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/vf-hollywood/2014/08/robin-williams-popeye |date=August 12, 2014 |work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |accessdate=August 13, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He stars as the leading character in ''[[The World According to Garp (film)|The World According to Garp]]'' (1982), which Williams considered "may have lacked a certain madness onscreen, but it had a great core".&lt;ref name=Zehme/&gt; He continued with other smaller roles in less successful films, such as ''[[The Survivors (1983 film)|The Survivors]]'' (1983) and ''[[Club Paradise]]'' (1986), though he said these roles did not help advance his film career.&lt;ref name=Zehme/&gt;

His first major break came from his starring role in director [[Barry Levinson]]'s ''[[Good Morning, Vietnam]]'' (1987), which earned Williams a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]].&lt;ref name="actors"/&gt; The film is set in 1965 during the [[Vietnam War]], with Williams playing the role of [[Adrian Cronauer]], a radio [[shock jock]] who keeps the troops entertained with comedy and sarcasm. Williams was allowed to play the role without a script, improvising most of his lines. Over the microphone, he created voice impressions of people, including [[Walter Cronkite]], [[Gomer Pyle]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[Mr. Ed]], and [[Richard Nixon]].&lt;ref name=Zehme&gt;{{cite news | last = Zehme | first =  Bill | work = [[Rolling Stone]] | pages = 29–32 | date = February 25, 1988 | accessdate = August 18, 2014 | url = https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/features/robin-williams-the-rolling-stone-interview-19880225 | title = Robin Williams: The Rolling Stone Interview }}&lt;/ref&gt; "We just let the cameras roll," said producer Mark Johnson, and Williams "managed to create something new for every single take."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Inventing Vietnam: The War in Film and Television|publisher = Temple University Press|year = 1991|isbn = 9780877228622|pages = 238|series = Culture And The Moving Image: Vol 6|editor-last = Anderegg|editor-first = Michael|location = Philadelphia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other roles Williams had in acclaimed dramatic films include ''[[Moscow on the Hudson]]'' (1984), ''[[Awakenings]]'' (1990), ''[[What Dreams May Come (film)|What Dreams May Come]]'' (1998), and ''[[Bicentennial Man (film)|Bicentennial Man]]'' (1999).&lt;ref name=allmovie_bio&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brennan|first1=Sandra|title=Robin Williams|url=http://www.allmovie.com/artist/robin-williams-p116900|website=[[Allmovie]]|accessdate=August 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Insomnia (2002 film)|Insomnia]]'', Williams portrayed a writer / killer on the run from a sleep-deprived Los Angeles policeman (played by [[Al Pacino]]) in rural Alaska.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Williams|first1=Karl|title=Insomnia (2002)|url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/insomnia-v260290|website=Allmovie|accessdate=August 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2002, in the psychological thriller ''[[One Hour Photo]]'', Williams played an emotionally disturbed photo development technician who becomes obsessed with a family for whom he has developed pictures for a long time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Deming|first1=Mark|title=One Hour Photo (2002)|url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/one-hour-photo-v260306|website=Allmovie|accessdate=August 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last Williams movie released during his lifetime was ''[[The Angriest Man in Brooklyn]]'', a film addressing the value of life. In it, Williams played Henry Altmann, a terminally ill man who reassesses his life and works to redeem himself.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Among the actors who helped him during his acting career, he credited [[Robert De Niro]], from whom he learned the power of silence and economy of dialog when acting, to portray the deep-driven man. From [[Dustin Hoffman]], with whom he co-starred in ''Hook'', he learned to take on totally different character types, and to transform his characters by extreme preparation. [[Mike Medavoy]], producer of ''Hook'', told its director, [[Steven Spielberg]], that he intentionally teamed up Hoffman and Williams for the film because he knew they wanted to work together, and that Williams welcomed the opportunity of working with Spielberg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = You're Only as Good as Your Next One: 100 Great Films, 100 Good Films, and 100 for Which I Should Be Shot|last = Medavoy|first = Mike|publisher = Simon &amp; Schuster (Altria)|year = 2002|isbn = 9780743400541|location = New York|pages = 228|others = Young, Josh (contributor)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams benefited from working with [[Woody Allen]], who directed him and Billy Crystal in ''[[Deconstructing Harry]]'' (1997), as Allen had knowledge of the fact that Crystal and Williams had often performed together on stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Conversations with Woody Allen: His Films, the Movies, and Moviemaking|last = Lax|first = Eric|publisher = Alfred A.

His performance in the role of a therapist in ''Good Will Hunting'' (1997) influenced some real therapists and won Williams an Academy Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ryan-thomas-neace-/requiem-for-a-therapist-a_b_5670467.html?page_version=legacy&amp;view=print&amp;comm_ref=false |title=Requiem for a Therapist: A Tribute to Robin Williams |date=August 12, 2014 |work=[[HuffPost]] |accessdate=October 23, 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6TYMul6HC?url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ryan-thomas-neace-/requiem-for-a-therapist-a_b_5670467.html?page_version=legacy&amp;view=print&amp;comm_ref=false |archivedate=October 24, 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Awakenings'' (1990), Williams played a doctor modeled on [[Oliver Sacks]], who wrote the book on which the film was based. Sacks later said the way the actor's mind worked was a "form of genius." In 1989 Williams played a private school teacher in ''Dead Poets Society'', which included a final, emotional scene which some critics said "inspired a generation" and became a part of pop culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/11/robin-williams-o-captain_n_5670177.html|title = Robin Williams and the 'O Captain' Scene That Inspired a Generation|last = Goodman|first = Jessica|date = August 11, 2014|work = HuffPost|accessdate = October 23, 2014|archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/6TYNZzpb6?url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/11/robin-williams-o-captain_n_5670177.html|archivedate = October 24, 2014|deadurl = no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Looking over most of his filmography, one writer was "struck by the breadth" and radical diversity of most roles Williams portrayed.&lt;ref name="WP"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/act-four/wp/2014/08/11/how-robin-williams-helped-us-grow-up/ |title=How Robin Williams helped us grow up |newspaper=The Washington Post |first=Alyssa |last=Rosenberg |date=August 11, 2014|archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/6TYOdTnDH?url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/act-four/wp/2014/08/11/how-robin-williams-helped-us-grow-up/|archivedate = October 24, 2014|deadurl = no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Terry Gilliam]], who co-founded ''[[Monty Python]]'' and directed Williams in two of his films, ''The Fisher King'' and ''[[The Adventures of Baron Munchausen]]'' (1988), noted in 1992 that Williams had the ability to "go from manic to mad to tender and vulnerable," adding that to him Williams was "the most unique mind on the planet. There's nobody like him out there."&lt;ref name="Grobel"/&gt;

During his career, he starred as a voice actor in several animated films. His voice role as the [[Genie (Disney)|Genie]] in the animated, musical fantasy film ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'' (1992) was written specifically for Williams. The film's directors stated that they took a risk by writing the role, and successfully convinced him to take it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOo9XqAyxE&amp;t=2m24s|via=[[YouTube]]|title=Turning Robin Williams into 'Aladdin's' Genie|publisher=[[ABC News]]|date=August 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through approximately 30 hours of tape,&lt;ref name="Kornbluth" /&gt; Williams was able to improvise much of his dialogue and impersonated dozens of celebrity voices, including [[Ed Sullivan]], [[Jack Nicholson]], Robert De Niro, [[Groucho Marx]], [[Rodney Dangerfield]], [[William F.

Williams and his second wife Marsha founded a philanthropic organization called the Windfall Foundation to raise money for many charities. In December 1999, he sang in [[French language|French]] on the [[BBC]]-inspired music video of international celebrities doing a cover of [[The Rolling Stones]] [[single (music)|single]] "[[It's Only Rock 'n Roll (But I Like It)]]" for the charity Children's Promise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Stones cover enters festive race | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/558252.stm |publisher=BBC News Online | date = December 10, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Williams started drinking alcohol again while working on a film in [[Alaska]].&lt;ref name=Greatest_dad /&gt; In 2006, he checked himself in to a substance-abuse rehabilitation center in [[Newberg, Oregon]], saying he was an [[alcoholic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=2515796 |title=Robin Williams Comes Clean on 'GMA' |publisher=ABC News |date=October 2, 2006 |accessdate=August 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cnn_duke"&gt;{{cite news |last=Duke |first=Alan |title=Robin Williams, short of breath, takes a break |url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/Movies/03/04/robin.williams.health/index.html?iref=nextin |publisher=[[CNN]] |accessdate=August 12, 2014|date = March 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an essay published in the journal ''Neurology'' two years after his death, Susan Schneider revealed that the pathology of Lewy body disease in Williams was described by several doctors as among the worst pathologies they had seen. She described the early symptoms of his disease as beginning in October 2013. It included a sudden and prolonged spike in fear and anxiety, constipation, urinary difficulty, heartburn, sleeplessness and insomnia, a poor sense of smell, stress, and a slight tremor in his left hand. Eventually, she said, he suffered from paranoia, delusions, severe insomnia, memory loss, and high cortisol levels, indicating stress. According to Schneider, "Robin was losing his mind and he was aware of it ... He kept saying, 'I just want to reboot my brain.'"&lt;ref name="Neurology"/&gt;

British heavy metal band [[Iron Maiden]] dedicated a song titled "Tears of a Clown" to Williams on their 2015 album ''[[The Book of Souls]]''. The song looks into Williams' depression and suicide, as well as how he attempted to hide his condition from the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Morgan Britton|first1=Luke|title=Iron Maiden dedicate new song 'Tears Of A Clown' to Robin Williams|url=http://www.nme.com/news/iron-maiden/87791|website=[[NME]]|accessdate=August 24, 2015|date=August 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after his death, [[Disney Channel]], [[Disney XD]], and [[Disney Junior]] all aired the original ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'' commercial-free over the course of a week, with a dedicated drawing of the genie at the end of each airing before the credits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/disney-networks-air-aladdin-honor-725640 Disney Networks to Air 'Aladdin' in Honor of Robin Williams], ''The Hollywood Reporter'', August 14, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Several late night talk show hosts, including [[Conan O'Brien]], [[David Letterman]] and [[Jimmy Fallon]] paid tribute to him in the days following his death.

In addition, several fans also paid tribute to Williams on [[social media]] with photo and video reenactments of the 1989 film ''[[Dead Poets Society]]''{{'}}s "O Captain!

==Legacy and influence==
{{quote box | align=left | width=25% | quote=You can't look at any modern comic and say, "That's the descendant of Robin Williams", because it's not possible to be a Robin Williams rip-off. ... He raised the bar for what it's possible to do, and made an enormous amount of us want to be comedians. | source=[[Judd Apatow]]&lt;ref name="Browne"/&gt;}}

Although Williams was first recognized as a stand-up comedian and television star, he later became known for acting in film roles of substance and serious drama. He was considered a "national treasure" by many in the entertainment industry and by the public.&lt;ref name=Grobel/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.showbiz411.com/2014/08/13/glenn-close-on-friend-and-colleague-robin-williams-was-a-world-treasure "Glenn Close on Friend and Colleague: 'Robin Williams Was a World Treasure'"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525045202/http://www.showbiz411.com/2014/08/13/glenn-close-on-friend-and-colleague-robin-williams-was-a-world-treasure |date=May 25, 2017 }}, ''Showbiz411'', August 13, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

His on-stage energy and improvisational skill became a model for a new generation of stand-up comedians. Many comedians valued the way he worked highly personal issues into his comedy routines, especially his honesty about drug and alcohol addiction, along with depression.&lt;ref name=CSM&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Society/2014/0812/Robin-Williams-His-unscripted-riffs-were-not-merely-funny-but-observant-video "Robin Williams: His unscripted riffs were not merely funny, but observant"],(+video), ''Christian Science Monitor'', August 12, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; According to media scholar Derek A. Burrill, because of the openness with which Williams spoke about his own life, "probably the most important contribution he made to pop culture, across so many different media, was as Robin Williams the person."&lt;ref name=CSM/&gt;

[[File:Robin Williams Walk of Fame.jpg|thumb|The star of Robin Williams on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]]]
Williams created a signature free-form persona in comedy, in a style that was so widely and uniquely identified with him, that new comedians imitated Williams personally. [[Jim Carrey]] impersonated his Mork character early in his own career.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|9zorOqE0j1c|"Jim Carrey Impersonates Robin Williams"}}&lt;/ref&gt; This high-spirited persona has been generally credited with paving the way for the growing comedy scene which developed in San Francisco. Young comedians felt more liberated on stage by seeing his spontaneously diverse range: "one moment acting as a bright, mischievous child, then as a wise philosopher or alien from outer space."&lt;ref&gt;Rappoport, Leon. ''Punchlines: The Case for Racial, Ethnic, and Gender Humor'', Greenwood Publishing (2005)  p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Judd Apatow]], the eclectic performer's rapid-fire improvisational style was an inspiration as well as an influence for other comedians, but that his talent was so extremely unusual that no one else could possibly attempt to copy it.&lt;ref name="Browne"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Browne |first=David |title=Robin Williams, 1951–2014 | work=[[Rolling Stone]] | date=September 11, 2014 | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/robin-williams-final-days-inside-rolling-stones-new-issue-20140827 | pages=38–47 | accessdate=August 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His film performances often influenced other actors, both in and out of the film industry. Director [[Chris Columbus (filmmaker)|Chris Columbus]], who directed Williams in ''[[Mrs. Doubtfire]]'', says that watching him work "was a magical and special privilege. His performances were unlike anything any of us had ever seen, they came from some spiritual and otherworldly place."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.vindy.com/news/2014/aug/13/chris-columbus-speaks-about-life-with-ro/?print|title = Valley native Chris Columbus speaks about life with Robin Williams|date = August 13, 2014|accessdate = October 24, 2014|website = vindy.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Looking over most of his filmography, Alyssa Rosenberg at ''[[The Washington Post]]'' was "struck by the breadth" and radical diversity of most of his roles, writing that "Williams helped us grow up."&lt;ref name="WP"/&gt;

Janet Hirshenson later revealed in an interview that Robin Williams had expressed interest in portraying [[Rubeus Hagrid]] in the ''[[Harry Potter (film series)|Harry Potter]]'' films, but was rejected by Chris Columbus due to the "British-only edict".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/movies/robin-williams-was-turned-down-for-a-key-harry-potter-role/news-story/1590a9c7c2dd974a1fa9758053acc97f|title='He really wanted to be in the movie'|publisher=[[news.com.au]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
