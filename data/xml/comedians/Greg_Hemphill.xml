==Career==

===Early career===
Hemphill has appeared in several projects. In 1990, he appeared at the [[Edinburgh Fringe]] where he was given the "So You Think You're Funny" trophy. He continued his stage work, appearing in the 1992 God Plus Support performance and in the popular 1995 ''[[Only an Excuse?]]'' tour. He also ventured into radio as the original presenter of football show, ''Off the Ball'' on [[BBC Radio Scotland]] and ''[[Eddie Mair]] Live''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12054495.Boys_on_the_ball/|title=Boys on the ball|website=HeraldScotland|language=en|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hemphill and Kiernan scripted seven episodes between 1999 and 2000, for then popular children's television show ''[[Hububb]]''. These were, Lullabubb, Top of the Bubbs, Conquer Leserest, Casual-Tea, Bubb Goes Boo, 2010: A Space Bubbsy and No Go Pogo. He guest starred alongside Kiernan in one episode, which he also scripted with Kiernan, Casual-Tea. However, his best known performances are alongside [[Ford Kiernan]] in the television [[sketch show]] ''Chewin' the Fat'' and its spin off, ''Still Game''. In series three of ''Still Game'', Hemphill's brother Steve has a cameo as a [[CN Tower]] [[elevator|lift]] operative.&lt;ref name="tv.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=TV.com|work=Steve Hemphill|url=http://www.tv.com/steve---hemphill/person/397148/summary.html|accessdate=31 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Still Game===
Following the success of ''[[Chewin' The Fat]]'', Kiernan and Hemphill wrote [[Still Game]]. Still Game was based on the original play that the pair wrote for the [[Edinburgh Festival]] in 1997. The Characters Jack Jarvis and Victor McDade had appeared throughout the four series of ''Chewin' The Fat''. Six series, and four specials were broadcast between 2002 and 2007.

In 2014, Still Game returned, with a live show at [[The SSE Hydro]], where Hemphill reunited with [[Ford Kiernan]]. The show was a sell out, and featured the whole original cast [[Paul Riley (actor)|Paul Riley]], [[Mark Cox (actor)|Mark Cox]], [[Jane McCarry]], [[Sanjeev Kohli]] and [[Gavin Mitchell (actor)|Gavin Mitchell]]. The series returned to television screens on [[BBC One]] in October 2016.

Kiernan and Hemphill announced another live show for [[SSE Hydro]] in 2017.

===Other Work===
Hemphill appeared in the [[Scottish Gaelic]]-language drama, ''Eilbheas'', in which Hemphill played the spirit of [[Elvis]] set in the [[Western Isles]]. It was first shown on the launch night of [[BBC Alba (TV channel)|BBC Alba]]. {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} He has also written ''Appointment with the Wicker Man'' with Donald McLeary for the [[National Theatre of Scotland]], a stage production about a small community's attempts to produce a musical version of ''[[The Wicker Man (1973 film)|The Wicker Man]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Alfred |last=Hickling |url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/feb/15/wicker-man-musical-interview |title=Playing with fire: The Wicker Man musical |date=15 February 2012 |accessdate=21 February 2012 |location=London |work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hemphill has been involved in the Scottish wrestling scene, matched against actor, comedian and writer, [[Robert Florence]]. They played bitter rivals at "Kelvin Brawl" in the Glasgow's [[Kelvin Hall]] on 21 June 2013. Comedian [[Frankie Boyle]] became part of this venture, unmasking himself at the end of the match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/13110684.Hemphill__Florence___and_Boyle__comedy_wrestling_match_descends_into_glorious_chaos/ |title=Hemphill, Florence...and Boyle: comedy wrestling match descends into glorious chaos (From Herald Scotland) |publisher=Heraldscotland.com |date=2013-06-23 |accessdate=2016-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=22 Jun 2013 Updated 09:11, 22 Jun 2013 |url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/kelvinbrawl-crowns-greg-hemphil-victor-1977656 |title=KelvinBrawl crowns Greg Hemphil the "Victor" over Burnistoun's Rab Florence |publisher=Daily Record |date=2013-06-22 |accessdate=2016-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
