'''Martha Raye''' (August 27, 1916 – October 19, 1994) was an American comic actress and singer who performed in movies, and later on television. She also acted in plays, including Broadway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Van Gelder|first1=Lawrence|title=Martha Raye, 78, Singer And Comic Actress, Dies|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/20/obituaries/martha-raye-78-singer-and-comic-actress-dies.html|accessdate=15 December 2014|work=New York Times|date=20 October 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;
She was honored in 1969 with an [[Academy Award]] as the [[Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award]] recipient for her volunteer efforts and services to the troops.

==Early years==
Raye's life as a singer and comedic performer began in very early childhood. She was born at St. James Hospital in [[Butte, Montana]], as '''Margy Reed''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.colonelmaggie.com/images/BirthCertificate.jpg ''Birth Certificate''], ColonelMaggie.com; accessed September 16, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=raye2&gt;{{cite web|title=125 Montana Newsmakers: Martha Raye|url=http://www.greatfallstribune.com/multimedia/125newsmakers6/raye.html|work=Great Falls Tribune|author=Tribune staff|accessdate=August 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; some sources give her real name as ''Maggie O'Reed''.&lt;ref&gt;''New York'', 19 January 1981, page 108: 26 January 1981 page 90.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clarke"&gt;{{cite book|title=Pseudonyms|author=Joseph F. Clarke|publisher=BCA|date=1977|page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her father, Peter F. Reed Jr., was an Irish immigrant, while her mother, Maybelle Hazel (Hooper) Reed, was raised in [[Milwaukee]] and Montana.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1368&amp;dat=19400227&amp;id=dWYcAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=zk4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6898,4941726]&lt;/ref&gt; Her parents were performing in a local [[vaudeville]] theatre as "Reed and Hooper" when their daughter was born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Lawrence Van Gelder|title=Martha Raye, 78, Singer And Comic Actress, Dies|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A02E3DD1E3CF933A15753C1A962958260|work=The New York Times|date=October 20, 1994|accessdate=2008-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, her mother was performing again. Martha first appeared in their act when she was three years old. She later performed with her brother "Bud", and the children became so popular that their parents' act was renamed "Margie and Bud."

==Career==
In the early 1930s, Raye was a band vocalist with the Paul Ash and [[Boris Morros]] orchestras. She made her first film appearance in 1934 in a band short titled ''A Nite in the Nite Club''. In 1936, she was signed for comic roles by [[Paramount Pictures]], and made her first picture for Paramount. Her first feature film was ''[[Rhythm on the Range]]'' with crooner [[Bing Crosby]].

From 1936–39, she was a featured cast member in 39 episodes of [[Al Jolson]]'s weekly CBS radio show, ''The Lifebuoy Program'', also called ''Cafe Trocadero.'' In addition to comedy, Martha sang both solos and duets with Jolson. Over the next quarter century, she would appear with many of the leading comics of her day, including [[Joe E. Brown (comedian)|Joe E. Brown]], [[Bob Hope]], [[W. C. Fields]], [[Abbott and Costello]] (in ''Keep 'Em Flying''), [[Charlie Chaplin]] (in ''Monsieur Verdoux''), and [[Jimmy Durante]]. She joined the [[United Service Organizations|USO]] in 1942, soon after the US entered World War II.&lt;ref name="rayeMT"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uso.org/stories/1804-martha-raye-healing-through-humor|title=Martha Raye: Healing Through Humor|last=Quigley|first=Samantha|date=April 26, 2013|publisher=United Service Organizations|work=USO.org|accessdate=October 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was known for the size of her mouth, which was large in proportion to her face, earning her the nickname '''The Big Mouth'''. She later referred to this in a series of television commercials for [[Polident]] denture cleaner in the 1980s: "So take it from The Big Mouth: new Polident Green gets tough stains clean!" Her large mouth would relegate her motion picture work to supporting comic parts, and was often made up so it appeared even larger. In the [[Disney]] cartoon ''[[Mother Goose Goes Hollywood]]'', she is caricatured while dancing alongside [[Joe E. Brown]], another actor known for a big mouth. In the [[Warner Bros.]] cartoon ''[[The Woods Are Full Of Cuckoos]]'' (1937), she was caricatured as a jazzy scat-singing donkey named 'Moutha Bray'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pittrone|first=Jane Maddern|page=216|title=Take It from the Big Mouth: The Life of Martha Raye|publisher=University of Kentucky Press|year=1999|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, she was awarded the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award in the form of an Oscar. On November 2, 1993, she was awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] by President [[Bill Clinton]] for her service to her country.&lt;ref name=rayeMT /&gt; The citation reads:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A talented performer whose career spans the better part of a century, Martha Raye has delighted audiences and uplifted spirits around the globe. She brought her tremendous comedic and musical skills to her work in film, stage, and television, helping to shape American entertainment. The great courage, kindness, and patriotism she showed in her many tours during World War II, the Korean conflict, and the Vietnam conflict earned her the nickname 'Colonel Maggie'. The American people honor Martha Raye, a woman who has tirelessly used her gifts to benefit the lives of her fellow Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.war-veterans.org/Maggie.htm|title=Colonel Martha "Maggie" Raye|publisher=[http://www.war-veterans.org/ war-veterans.org].}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Television career===
She was a television star very early in its history, and even had her own program for a while, ''[[The Martha Raye Show]]'' (1954–1956), with an awkward boyfriend portrayed by retired [[middleweight]] boxer [[Rocky Graziano]] (whom she called "[[goombah]]", Sicilian slang for the Italian 'compare' [best friend]{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}).  (The writer and producer was future ''[[The Phil Silvers Show]]'' creator [[Nat Hiken]].)

Some of the guest stars on the show were [[Zsa Zsa Gabor]], [[Cesar Romero]], and [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] dancer [[Wayne Lamb]]. She also appeared on other TV shows in the 1950s, such as ''[[What's My Line?]]''.

Following the demise of her TV variety show, the breakup of her fifth marriage, and a series of other personal and health problems, she attempted [[suicide]] by overdosing on sleeping pills on August 14, 1956. Well-wishers gave her a [[St. Christopher]]'s medal, a [[Genesius of Rome|St. Genesius]] medal, and a [[Star of David]]. After her recovery, she wore these amulets faithfully, although she was neither [[Roman Catholic]] nor [[Jewish]]. At the conclusion of each episode of her TV shows, she would thank the nuns at the Sisters of St. Francis Hospital in [[Miami, Florida|Miami]], [[Florida]], where she had recovered. She would always say, "Goodnight, Sisters" as a sign of appreciation and gratitude.

Later in her career, she made television commercials for [[Polident]] denture cleanser, principally during the 1970s and 1980s.

===Later career===
In 1970, she portrayed Boss Witch, the "Queen of all Witchdom", in the feature [[film]] ''[[Pufnstuf (film)|Pufnstuf]]'' for [[Sid and Marty Krofft]]. This led to her being cast as villainess Benita Bizarre in ''[[The Bugaloos]]'' (1970), which the Kroffts produced the same year.

She often appeared as a guest on other programs, particularly ones that often had older performers as guest stars such as [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[The Love Boat]]'', and on variety programs including the short-lived ''[[The Roy Rogers and Dale Evans Show]]''. She appeared from the third to the ninth seasons as Carrie Sharples on ''[[Alice (TV series)|Alice]]'', making two or three appearances a season. She made guest appearances or did [[cameo role]]s in such series as ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'' on CBS and ''[[The Andy Williams Show]]'' and ''[[McMillan &amp; Wife]]'', both on [[NBC]]. She appeared again as Agatha for the six-episode run of the retooled ''McMillan'', taking over for [[Nancy Walker]], who had left the series. Her last film appearance was as an incontinent airline passenger in the disaster film ''[[The Concorde ... Airport '79]]'' (1979).

==Personal life==
Raye's personal life was complex and emotionally tumultuous.&lt;ref name="ms540425"&gt;{{cite news|first=Martha|last=Raye|work=[[The American Weekly]]|page=7|title=Me and My Big Mouth|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=53QxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=yA8EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5898,6485827&amp;dq=martha-raye-show&amp;hl=en|date=April 25, 1954|accessdate=February 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was married seven times.

Raye was a devout [[Methodism|Methodist]] who regularly attended church, read the Bible daily, and even taught [[Sunday school]] classes.&lt;ref&gt;Pitrone, Maddern Jean ''Take It from the Big Mouth: The Life of Martha Raye'' Hardcover, The University of Kentucky Press, April 8, 1999, pp. 220-221 {{ISBN|0-8131-2110-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because her religious views were often misconstrued throughout her life, she was noted for having said, "One paper says I'm Catholic and the other says I'm Jewish. I guess that's fitting because as a Methodist I'm meant to be undetermined some of the time".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.azquotes.com/quote/1120507&lt;/ref&gt;

Her engagement to orchestra leader Johnny Torrence was announced in June 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper Chicago Tribune |articlename=Martha Raye, Film Actress, Engaged to Band Leader |date=June 25, 1936 |page_number=17 |issue=Final }}&lt;/ref&gt; Less than two months later she commented, "They tell me I've gone Hollywood already because I got engaged to Johnny Torence one day and broke it off the next."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper Salt Lake Telegram |articlename=Funny Face Wins Star Niche For Martha Raye |date=August 15, 1936 |page_number=8 |issue=Home Edition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was married to make-up artist [[Bud Westmore|Hamilton "Buddy" Westmore]] from May 30, 1937, until September 1937, filing for divorce on the basis of extreme cruelty; to composer-conductor [[David Rose (songwriter)|David Rose]] from October 8, 1938 to May 19, 1941; to Neal Lang from May 25, 1941 to February 3, 1944; to Nick Condos from February 22, 1944 to June 17, 1953; to Edward T. Begley from April 21, 1954 to October 6, 1956; to Robert O'Shea from November 7, 1956 to December 1, 1960; and to Mark Harris from September 25, 1991 until her death in 1994. She had one child, a daughter, Melodye Condos (born July 26, 1944), with fourth husband Condos.

Politically, Raye was [[Conservatism|conservative]], affirming her political views by informing an interviewer, "I am a Republican because I believe in the constitution, strength in national defense, limited government, individual freedom, and personal responsibility as the concrete foundation for American government. They reinforce the resolve that the United States is the greatest country in the world and we can all be eternally grateful to our founding fathers for the beautiful legacy they left us today."&lt;ref&gt;Interview, ''The Hollywood Reporter'', 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.azquotes.com/quote/1120508&lt;/ref&gt; Martha Raye was the fifth person to be awarded Honorary Green Beret. While in Vietnam she would assist those in combat hospitals instead of performing because she was a [[Licensed practical nurse|LPN]].

===Death===
Her final years were plagued by ill health. She suffered from [[Alzheimer's disease]] and had lost both legs in 1993 from poor circulation. While in poor health and resting in the hospital bed that had to be placed in her home, Martha and husband Mark Harris (who, because of their controversial May/December relationship, became a frequent guest on the popular Howard Stern radio program) moved into a hotel after their home was completely destroyed by the [[1994 Northridge earthquake|1994 earthquake]]. Raye died in Los Angeles at 78 of [[pneumonia]] on October 19, 1994, after a long history of cardiovascular disease.

In appreciation of her work with the [[United Service Organizations|USO]] during World War II and subsequent wars, special consideration was given to bury her in [[Arlington National Cemetery]] on her death, but on her request, she was buried with full military honors in the [[Fort Bragg]], North Carolina, post cemetery as an honorary colonel in the U.S. Marines and an honorary lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Army.&lt;ref name=rayeMT /&gt; She is the only civilian buried at this location who receives military honors each Veterans Day. {{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

Raye has two stars on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]—one for motion pictures at 6251 [[Hollywood Boulevard]] and the other for television at 6547 Hollywood Blvd.
