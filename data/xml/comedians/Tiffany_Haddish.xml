==Early life and education==
Haddish was born and raised in [[Los Angeles, California]].&lt;ref name=VanityFair-GirlsTrip-2017/&gt; Her father, Tsihaye Reda Haddish, was a refugee from [[Eritrea]], and was from an [[Eritrean Jews|Eritrean Jewish]] family.&lt;ref name="Champs-Podcast-2015"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brennan|first1=Neal|last2=Kasher|first2=Moshe|last3=Haddish|first3=Tiffany|title=Tiffany Haddish|url=http://hwcdn.libsyn.com/p/f/7/5/f751787ac50f3b38/Tiffany_Haddish_Output.mp3?c_id=8159893&amp;destination_id=71836&amp;expiration=1500870894&amp;hwt=fe3004a89e23d37d01cf28aed4b300d7|work=[[The Champs (podcast)|The Champs]]|date=2015-01-07|format=Audio podcast}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Power105-BfastClub-GirlsTrip-2017&gt;{{cite news|last1=DJ Envy|last2=Yee|first2=Angela|last3=Charlamagne Tha God|last4=Haddish|first4=Tiffany|title=Tiffany Haddish Speaks On Girls Trip, Escaping Death, Raising Her Siblings &amp; More|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ09OnwuXZs|work=[[The Breakfast Club (radio show)|The Breakfast Club]]|publisher=[[WWPR-FM]]|date=2017-06-19|format=Video interview}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother, Leola, was an [[African-American]] small business owner and a [[Jehovah's Witness]].&lt;ref name=Power105-BfastClub-GirlsTrip-2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=Essence-GirlsTrip-2017&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kwateng-Clark|first1=Danielle|title=5 Things To Know And Love About 'Girls Trip' Star Tiffany Haddish|url=http://www.essence.com/tiffany-haddish-facts-girls-trip|work=[[Essence (magazine)|Essence]]|date=2017-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LAWeekly-BreakoutComedian-2016&gt;{{cite news|last1=Seabaugh|first1=Julie|title=Best Breakout Comedian: Tiffany Haddish – Best of L.A. 2016|url=http://www.laweekly.com/best-of/2016/arts-and-entertainment/best-breakout-comedian-7434200|work=[[LA Weekly]]|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DomIrreraLive-Interview-2012&gt;{{cite news|last1=Irrera|first1=Dom|last2=Haddish|first2=Tiffany|title=Dom Irrera Live from The Laugh Factory with Tiffany Haddish|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fcnUmOD1fs|work=Dom Irrera Live from The Laugh Factory|date=2012-11-17|format=Video interview (comedy podcast)}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Haddish's father left when she was three years old, her mother remarried and went on to have more children; Haddish has two half-sisters and two half-brothers.&lt;ref name=AnnaFaris-Unqualified22-2016&gt;{{cite news|last1=Faris|first1=Anna|last2=Sarna|first2=Sim|last3=Haddish|first3=Tiffany|title=Episode #22 Tiffany Haddish!|url=http://www.unqualified.com/2016/05/09/episode-25-tiffany-haddish/|work=Anna Faris Is Unqualified|date=2016-05-09|format=Podcast – audio}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988 while living in [[Colton, California|Colton]], California,&lt;ref name="Champs-Podcast-2015" /&gt; Haddish's stepfather tampered with the brakes on her mother’s car, leading to an accident in which Leola suffered severe brain damage. The tampering was allegedly intended to harm Haddish and her siblings as well, but they had opted to stay home on the day of the accident.&lt;ref name="Atlantic 2017-09"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/09/the-remarkable-rise-of-tiffany-haddish/538872/|title=The Remarkable Rise of Tiffany Haddish|last=Jeffries|first=Michael P.|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2017-12-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The brain damage possibly triggered Leola's [[schizophrenia]]. Haddish, then age nine and the oldest of her five siblings, became the primary caregiver for her family.&lt;ref name="Atlantic 2017-09"/&gt;

At 12, Haddish and her siblings were put into [[foster care]] where they were temporarily separated from each other. While there, she used comedy as a way to cope with being in situations with new people.&lt;ref name="People-Carmichael-2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gomez|first1=Patric|title=The Carmichael Show’s Tiffany Haddish: From Foster Care Kid to Sitcom Star|url=http://people.com/tv/the-carmichael-shows-tiffay-haddish-from-foster-care-kid-to-sitcom-star/|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]|date=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; When she was 15, she and her siblings were reunited under the care of their grandmother.

She attended George Ellery Hale Middle School in [[Woodland Hills, Los Angeles|Woodland Hills]] and graduated from [[El Camino Real High School]], also in Woodland Hills, where she was the school mascot.&lt;ref name="Champs-Podcast-2015" /&gt; Haddish said she could not read very well until high school, but improved when she received tutoring from a teacher.&lt;ref name="DomIrreraLive-Interview-2012" /&gt; She also got in a lot of trouble at school, despite her award-winning participation in drama competition featuring Shakespearean monologues. In 1997, after her social worker gave her an ultimatum to either attend psychiatric therapy or go to the [[Laugh Factory]] Comedy Camp, then 17-year-old Haddish opted for comedy as outlet for her pain.&lt;ref name="Champs-Podcast-2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="OriginMagazine-DreamsComeTrue-2012"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Haddish|first1=Tiffany|title=Dreams Come True Through Laughter|url=https://issuu.com/originmagazine/docs/10_art-conscious_lo/58|work=Origin Magazine|issue=10|date=December 2012|page=57|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has said that the mentorship from many notable comedians—including [[Richard Pryor]], [[Dane Cook]], [[Charles Fleischer]], the [[Wayans brothers]]&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2017/07/tiffany-haddish-girls-trip-interview-1201856785/|title=Tiffany Haddish: Why The ‘Girls Trip’ Star Is This Year’s Comedy Wonder Woman|last=Miller|first=Liz Shannon|date=2017-07-19|work=IndieWire|access-date=2017-12-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;—helped her discover her passion for comedy and it "literally saved her life."&lt;ref name="Champs-Podcast-2015" /&gt; She has said that she incorporates her past real life experiences in her sets, finding that doing so functions as a sort of "[[safe space]]" for her.&lt;ref name="Champs-Podcast-2015" /&gt;

Haddish stated in 2018 that at the age of seventeen she was sexually assaulted by a police cadet.&lt;ref&gt;https://amp.usatoday.com/amp/874493002&lt;/ref&gt; She has stated that this led to her having an aggressive front when it comes to avoiding unwanted advances from men.&lt;ref&gt; http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2018/07/31/tiffany-haddish-reveals-was-raped-at-17-by-police-cadet.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Before her on-screen success, Haddish held a number of jobs, including customer service for [[Alaska Airlines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/07/girls-trip-tiffany-haddish|title=Girls Trip Star Tiffany Haddish Is the Funniest Person Alive Right Now|last=Desta|first=Yohana|work=HWD|access-date=2017-12-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haddish has said she lived in her car during her 20s while in her early days of comedy.&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt;
