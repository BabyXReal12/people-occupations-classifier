'''Rita Rudner''' (born September 17, 1953) is an American comedian. Beginning her career as a Broadway dancer, Rita Rudner noticed the lack of female comedians in [[New York City]] and turned to stand-up comedy where she has flourished for over three decades. Her performance on a variety of [[HBO]] specials and numerous appearances on ''[[The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson]]'', helped establish Rudner as one of the premier female comics to emerge from the comedy boom of the 1980s.

==Early life==
Rudner was born in Miami, Florida,&lt;ref name="lasvegasweeklyinterview"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Seabaugh|first1=Julie|title=The Simple Life of Rita Rudner; Fame, Fortune, Two Thousand Shows, Five Books, a Play, a Husband, a Daughter|url=http://lasvegasweekly.com/news/2008/jun/05/simple-life-rita-rudner/|accessdate=December 13, 2016|work=Las Vegas Weekly|date=June 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; the daughter of Frances, a homemaker, and Abe Rudner, a lawyer.
