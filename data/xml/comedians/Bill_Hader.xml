Hader attended Patrick Henry Elementary School, [[Edison Preparatory School|Edison Junior High]], and [[Cascia Hall Preparatory School]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Smith, [http://www.tulsaworld.com/entertainment/spot/article.aspx?articleID=070817_8_ES14_Itwas70410 "Super Glad: Native Tulsan Bill Hader moves from ‘SNL’ success to big-budget film roles,"] ''[[Tulsa World]]'', August 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Smith, [http://www.tulsaworld.com/spot/article.aspx?subjectid=243&amp;articleid=20090403_282_D1_JasonP931046 "Talking about Tulsa days: Bill Hader finally found a vocation in comedy"], ''[[Tulsa World]]'', April 3, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He had "a hard time focusing on class" and was always "joking around". Though he was not hated by classmates, he felt he never truly fit in and filled his time watching movies and reading.&lt;ref name="pb13"/&gt; He appreciated [[Monty Python]], [[British comedy]], and the films of [[Mel Brooks]] and [[Woody Allen]],&lt;ref name="i14"/&gt; many of which he was introduced to through his father.&lt;ref name="pb13"/&gt; He made short films with friends and starred in a school production of ''[[The Glass Menagerie]]''.&lt;ref name="i14"/&gt;

He was unable to gain admission to top [[film school]]s because of his "abysmal" grades, so he instead enrolled at [[The Art Institute of Phoenix]],&lt;ref name="07ok"&gt;Gene Triplett, [http://newsok.com/article/3105814 "Funny things about Bill Hader: Growing up in Tulsa as ‘movie nerd' gave comic actor material,"] ''[[The Oklahoman]]'', August 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and later [[Scottsdale Community College]].&lt;ref name="pb13"/&gt; He worked as an usher at a movie theater in nearby [[Tempe, Arizona|Tempe]], which allowed him to see films for free.

==Career==
===Early career===
Hader's aspirations of becoming a filmmaker&lt;ref name="huffpost07-14"/&gt; eventually led him to drop out of college and move to Los Angeles in 1999.&lt;ref name="nyt2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pb13"&gt;{{cite news|title=20Q: Bill Hader|work=[[Playboy]]|author=Rob Tannenbaum|date=September 2013|url=http://playboy.co.za/20q-bill-hader|accessdate=November 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents were supportive of his decision to move, and Hader used the money they had originally saved for his college education to cover his living expenses when he arrived in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name="i14"/&gt; He found work as a [[production assistant]] (PA) while scouring the back pages of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'',&lt;ref name="g14"/&gt; and he hoped to advance far enough to become an assistant director.&lt;ref name="g14"/&gt; He spent much of his young adulthood "lonely and underemployed," filling large amounts of spare time with movie marathons.&lt;ref name="g14"&gt;{{cite news|title=Bill Hader’s Day Off|author=Amos Barhsad|publisher=[[Grantland.com]]|date=August 25, 2014|url=http://grantland.com/features/bill-hader-saturday-night-live-snl-week/|accessdate=November 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He regularly worked 18-hour days as a PA, having little time to pursue his creative ambitions.&lt;ref name="i14"/&gt; He worked as a PA on the DVD ''[[Empire of Dreams: The Story of the Star Wars Trilogy]]''; the feature films ''[[James Dean (film)|James Dean]]'',&lt;ref name="jamesfrancoesquire"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esquire.com/features/james-franco/james-franco-bill-hader-0910 |title=Four Introductions to James Franco |publisher=''Esquire'' |date= |first=Bill |last=Hader |accessdate=October 14, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]'',&lt;ref name="jamesfrancoesquire"/&gt; and ''[[Collateral Damage (film)|Collateral Damage]]'';&lt;ref name="nyt2007"/&gt; as well as a post-production assistant on [[VH1]] television's ''[[The Surreal Life]]''.&lt;ref name="huffpost2010"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aoltv.com/2010/09/24/snl-star-bill-hader-talks-the-new-season-jon-hamms-return-an/ |title='SNL' Star Bill Hader Talks the New Season, Jon Hamm's Return and His 'Surreal Life' Experience with Corey Feldman |publisher=''The Huffington Post'' |date=September 24, 2010 |first=Kim |last=Potts |accessdate=October 14, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120921063946/http://www.aoltv.com/2010/09/24/snl-star-bill-hader-talks-the-new-season-jon-hamms-return-an/ |archivedate=September 21, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hader briefly worked as a PA and stage manager on [[Playboy TV]]'s ''[[Night Calls]]'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifc.com/fix/2014/09/bill-hader-playboy-tv-kimmel |title=BILL HADER TALKS ABOUT HIS PLAYBOY TV PAST ON KIMMEL |publisher=IFC |date=September 10, 2014 |accessdate=October 14, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uproxx.com/tv/2014/09/bill-hader-jimmy-kimmel-playboy-call-in-show/ |title=Here's Bill Hader Describing What It Was Like To Work The Phones for a Playboy Call-In Sex Show |publisher=Uproxx |date=September 10, 2014 |first=Kris |last=Maske |accessdate=October 14, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nyobserver2014"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://observer.com/2014/09/funnyman-bill-hader-on-going-serious-you-have-to-empty-yourself-a-little-bit/ |title=Funnyman Bill Hader on Going Serious: ‘You Have to Empty Yourself a Little Bit’ |publisher=''New York Observer'' |date=September 11, 2014 |first=Vinnie |last=Mancuso |accessdate=October 22, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; he quit, as he feared it would disappoint his parents.&lt;ref name="ifc14"&gt;{{cite web|title=5 Jobs You Probably Didn't Know Bill Hader Once Had|author=Brian Steele|date=August 24, 2015|accessdate=November 26, 2015|publisher=[[IFC (TV channel)|IFC.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He quit being a PA altogether after a bad experience shooting ''[[The Scorpion King]]''.&lt;ref name="g14"/&gt;

He subsequently secured a job working as a nighttime assistant editor at post-production facility [[Triage Entertainment]].&lt;ref name="i14"/&gt;&lt;ref name="g14"/&gt; He invested money into his own short film, but was too embarrassed to release it. Shortly thereafter, Hader and his then-longtime girlfriend broke up.&lt;ref name="fcc14"&gt;{{cite news|title=How Bill Hader Went from Production Assistant to ''SNL'' Hero to Leading Man|author=Joe Berkowitz|date=September 24, 2014|work=[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]|url=http://www.fastcocreate.com/3036180/then-and-now/how-bill-hader-went-from-production-assistant-to-snl-hero-to-leading-man|accessdate=November 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Desperate for a change, he began attending comedy classes with friends at [[improvisational comedy]] enterprise [[the Second City]] in March 2003.&lt;ref name="07ok"/&gt; He quickly realized that comedy was the creative outlet that he had needed since he made the decision to leave higher education behind,&lt;ref name="i14"/&gt; and soon Hader, his new compatriot in comedy Matt Offerman, and their two friends and fellow humor enthusiasts Eric Filipkowski and Mel Cowan, elected to form their own sketch comedy group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hollywoodphony.wordpress.com/2008/05/11/my-father-jocko-filipkowski/|title=My father, Jocko Filipkowski|date=2008-05-11|work=hollywoodphony|access-date=2018-04-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christening their group ''Animals from the Future'', the four frequently appeared to small audiences at backyard shows in Van Nuys.&lt;ref name="g14"/&gt; Matt's brother, actor [[Nick Offerman]], told his wife, [[Megan Mullally]], about the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/08/22/159766489/bill-hader-on-sketch-comedy-his-love-of-old-films |title=Bill Hader on Sketch Comedy, His Love of Old Films |publisher=NPR |date=August 22, 2012 |accessdate=October 14, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theringer.com/tv/2018/3/19/17131052/bill-hader-barry-show-hbo|title=The Name’s Hader … Bill Hader|work=The Ringer|access-date=2018-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mullally, her interest piqued, wanted to see their work personally and, after attending one of the group’s backyard appearances, she informed Hader of her intention to discuss him, specifically, with [[Lorne Michaels]], creator and executive producer of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (''SNL''). Hader, as a result of Mullally’s recommendation, was asked to audition for the show, and soon flew to New York to audition for a group of ''SNL'' producers. Hader, who would later receive acclaim for his excellent impressions of others while appearing on ''SNL'', had no impressions prepared when he was invited to audition. Despite being nervous and struggling to display his strengths during the audition, this resulted in his spontaneous imitation of an elderly Italian man he had once overheard; this impression would later become the first of Hader’s many recurring characters on the show: Vinny Vedecci.&lt;ref name="g14" /&gt; As a result of the audition, Hader got an agent and manager.&lt;ref name="pb13"/&gt; Just before he was officially invited to begin work on ''SNL'', Hader was working as an assistant editor on ''[[Iron Chef America]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gawker.com/5784918/bill-hader-shares-his-road-to-saturday-night-live |title=Bill Hader Shares His Road to Saturday Night Live |author=Whitney Jefferson |publisher=Gawker Media |work=Gawker |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150115013528/http://gawker.com/5784918/bill-hader-shares-his-road-to-saturday-night-live |archivedate=January 15, 2015 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Saturday Night Live''===
Hader was hired as a featured player and made his debut on the show on October 1, 2005. His first role was as a [[psychologist]] giving his views about life and death during the emergency landing of [[JetBlue Airways Flight 292]]. He felt he had gone from "preschool to [[Harvard]]."&lt;ref name="fcc14"/&gt; He became the "impressions guy," hoping to fill a utility-player role "like his hero [[Phil Hartman]]".&lt;ref name="g14"/&gt; Hader has said that he performed impersonations of teachers and friends when he was growing up but did not do impersonations of famous people until his ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' audition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://billhaderonline.com/main/2007/10/08/bill-hader-does-interview-with-bill-hader-online "Bill Hader does interview with BHO!"]. Retrieved October 14, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; His list of impressions includes [[Vincent Price]] in the Variety Vault sketches, [[Harvey Fierstein]], [[Charlie Rose]], [[Al Pacino]], [[Brian Grazer]], [[Rick Perry]], [[John Malkovich]], [[Seth Rogen]], [[James Carville]], [[Steven Van Zandt]] (as [[Silvio Dante]]), [[Julian Assange]], [[Eliot Spitzer]], [[Alan Alda]], [[Clint Eastwood]], and [[Charlie Sheen]]. On July 19, 2012, Hader received his first nomination for a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series]] for his work on ''SNL''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/race/emmys-2012-saturday-night-live-bill-hader-351992|title=Emmys 2012: 'SNL's' Bill Hader Shocked By Nomination, Says It Wasn't on His Radar|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate=July 19, 2012|first=Philiana|last=Ng|date=July 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/19/emmy-nominees-bill-hader-of-saturday-night-live/ | work=The New York Times | first=Dave | last=Itzkoff | title=Emmy Nominees: Bill Hader of 'Saturday Night Live' | date=July 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the first male ''SNL'' cast member to receive this nomination since Eddie Murphy in 1984.

Despite this, Hader suffered from anxiety and sleep problems during his tenure at the program.&lt;ref name="pb13"/&gt; He never felt "truly comfortable" throughout his first four seasons.&lt;ref name="g14"/&gt; He was insecure that he had less comedy experience than his peers. He would often not sleep on Fridays before the show, and would feel light-headed prior to broadcasts.&lt;ref name="pb13"/&gt; He was neurotic regarding his performances; Hader called his early performances "rigid".&lt;ref name="g14"/&gt; On one occasion, he began having a [[panic attack]], live, while impersonating Assange. It was the final episode of 2010, and Hader remembered it: "It felt like someone was sitting on my chest. I couldn’t breathe, I started sweating. I thought, ''This is not good — abort! abort!''"&lt;ref name="pb13"/&gt; Michaels tried to put him at ease by remarking to him, "You can work here as long as you want," after one show hosted by [[Seth Rogen]].&lt;ref name="g14"/&gt;

Hader decided to leave ''SNL'' after eight seasons, informing cast and crew of his decision in February 2013. He came to the conclusion that he needed to leave when his then-wife and he were constantly having to travel to Los Angeles for work, which made it difficult for their children.&lt;ref name="pb13"/&gt; Working on the program had become difficult upon the birth of his first daughter, and even more so when his second child arrived.&lt;ref name="i14"&gt;{{cite news|title=Interview: Bill Hader|work=[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]]|author=[[Danny McBride]]|url=http://www.interviewmagazine.com/film/bill-hader#_|accessdate=November 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His final episode was on May 18, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bill Hader to Leave ''Saturday Night Live''|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/15/arts/television/bill-hader-to-leave-saturday-night-live.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;smid=tw-nytimes&amp;_r=0|publisher=NY Times|accessdate=May 14, 2013|first=Dave|last=Itzkoff|date=May 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; "It was a hard decision, but it has to happen at some point," he told reporters. "It got to a point where I said, 'Maybe it's just time to go.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jdjournal.com/2013/05/15/bill-hader-leaves-saturday-night-live/|title=Bill Hader Leaves Saturday Night Live – JD Journal|author=Daniel June|date=May 15, 2013|work=jdjournal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 11, 2014, Hader returned as host with musical guest [[Hozier (musician)|Hozier]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Perkins|first1=Dennis|title=''Saturday Night Live'': "Bill Hader/Hozier"|url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/saturday-night-live-bill-haderhozier-210385|website=[[The A.V.
