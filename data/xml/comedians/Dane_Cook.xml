==Career==
[[File:Dane Cook.jpg|thumb|Dane Cook]]

===Early work===
On October 30, 1992, Cook and a group of local emerging improv/sketch comedians were scheduled to appear at the [[Boston Garden]] as part of local radio station [[WBCN (FM)|WBCN]]'s "Rock of Boston" music concert. Although they anticipated appearing earlier in the lineup, they were scheduled to perform between popular band [[Spin Doctors]] and the final headline act [[Phish]], making them somewhat nervous but determined to do well. Moments after they took the stage however, the crowd, neither expecting nor appreciating a comedy act at this late stage in the evening's program and impatient for Phish to go on, expressed their displeasure by throwing their shoes at the stage. [[Robert Kelly (comedian)|Robert Kelly]], also on stage as a member of the comedy group, pleaded with the audience to settle down and let them perform their act; the crowd instead escalated to throwing lighters. Sustaining minor injuries, Cook and the comedy group left the stage. Cook described the incident – as well as how dejected he felt and his resulting determination to someday return to the Boston Garden and perform successfully someday – as part of a web series for [[The Tonight Show]] entitled "Worst I Ever Bombed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ArgJy-K0YE#t=42|title=Worst I Ever Bombed: Dane Cook|date=3 October 2014|work=YouTube|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.relix.com/blogs/detail/video_a_phish_crowd_threw_shoes_and_lighters_at_dane_cook|title=Video: A Phish Crowd Threw Shoes and Lighters at Dane Cook|work=Relix|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stand-up===
In 1994, Cook moved to [[New York City]] and began performing. Two years later, he moved to [[Los Angeles]], where he still lives today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://punchlinemagazine.com/site/?p=224|title=Punchline Magazine interview|publisher=Punchlinemagazine.com|date=2005-11-07|accessdate=2010-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; His big break came in 1998 when he appeared on [[Comedy Central]]'s ''[[Premium Blend]]''. In 2000, Cook did a half-hour special on ''[[Comedy Central Presents]]''. Since then his special has won the [[Stand-up showdown|Comedy Central Stand-up showdown]] twice in a row.&lt;ref name="comedycentral.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comedycentral.com/comedians/browse/c/dane_cook.jhtml|title=Comedy Central.com biodata on Dane Cook|publisher=Comedycentral.com|accessdate=2010-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Cook released his first [[Compact Disc|CD]]/[[DVD]], ''[[Harmful If Swallowed]]''. He signed a contract with [[Comedy Central Records]]. The album is [[Music recording sales certification|certified platinum]]. He released his second CD/DVD in 2005, entitled ''[[Retaliation (Dane Cook album)|Retaliation]]''. This album went [[Music recording sales certification|double platinum]] and made Cook the first comic in 29 years to have an album at #4 on the Billboard charts.&lt;ref name="comedycentral.com" /&gt; He performed at the [[MTV Video Music Awards]], and then afterwards he joined [[Snoop Dogg]] in presenting the award for [[MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]].&lt;ref name="comedycentral.com" /&gt;

On April 15, 2005, Cook performed his first HBO Special entitled ''Vicious Circle''. ''[[Dane Cook: Vicious Circle|Vicious Circle]]'' was filmed "[[Theatre in the round|in the round]]" at the [[TD Garden]]. The same year, Cook shot two pilot episodes for his own sitcom, ''Cooked''. The sitcom never got picked up and the two pilot episodes were later released on DVD as the ''Lost Pilot Episodes''. That same year, he embarked on a 30-day, 20-show college tour called Tourgasm with his longtime friends [[Robert Kelly (comedian)|Robert Kelly]], [[Gary Gulman]], and [[Jay Davis]]. The tour was filmed and was later made into a 9-episode documentary on HBO.

On December 3, 2005, Cook hosted ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (''SNL''). He would then go on to host the premiere of season 32 of ''SNL'' a year later.

In 2006, Cook headlined for [[Dave Attell's Insomniac Tour]] and hosted the 2006 [[Teen Choice Awards]] alongside [[Jessica Simpson]]. The following year he won the award for Best Comedian. On November 12, 2007, Cook became the second comic to sell out Madison Square Garden. He did two sold out shows in one night. The show was filmed and would later be put onto a DVD to be sold on Cook's third comedy album. Cook won the Big Entertainer Award at the VH1 Big in '06 Awards, and ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine's Hot Comic of the Year. The following day, November 13, 2007, he released his third CD/DVD entitled ''Rough Around The Edges'', which was filmed live at [[Madison Square Garden]] in [[New York City]]. During that time, he embarked on his first arena tour.

On April 10, 2007, Cook broke the [[Laugh Factory]]'s endurance record (previously held by [[Richard Pryor]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2008-01-03-dane-cook_N.htm|title=Dane Cook breaks comedy endurance record|publisher=Usatoday.com|date=2008-01-03|accessdate=2010-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; by performing on stage for three hours and 50 minutes. [[Dave Chappelle]] would break the record five days later by performing for six hours and seven minutes. Chappelle beat that record on December 3, 2007 by performing for six hours and twelve minutes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2007/SHOWBIZ/TV/12/04/people.davechappelle.ap/ Dave Chappelle's standup marathon: 6 hours, 12 minutes] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080327081353/http://www.cnn.com/2007/SHOWBIZ/TV/12/04/people.davechappelle.ap/ |date=March 27, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 1, 2008, Cook broke Chappelle's record, by performing on stage for seven hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/action/article/6177/news/culture/dane_cook_breaks_dave_chappelles_endurance_record |title=Dane Cook breaks Dave Chappelle's endurance record |publisher=Pastemagazine.com |date=2008-01-07 |accessdate=2010-05-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080508074728/http://www.pastemagazine.com/action/article/6177/news/culture/dane_cook_breaks_dave_chappelles_endurance_record |archivedate=May 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From May 23, 2008 to May 25, 2008, Cook reunited with Robert Kelly and Al Del Bene for three shows at The Coliseum in [[Caesars Palace]]. From May 29-June 4, 2008 the trio went to Iraq to perform for the troops. Del Bene was the Emcee, Kelly was the Feature, and Cook was the Headliner.

He finished his fourth album, ''[[Isolated Incident]]''; a performance which aired on Comedy Central on May 17, 2009, with the release of the record following two days later. He kicked off that tour at the Mohegan Sun in [[Uncasville, Connecticut]], on April 25, 2009. This album will be the last as part of Cook's four-record deal with Comedy Central Records. The new album was performed at Laugh Factory in Hollywood, which is considered to be Cook's home base, where he goes and works on new material. He released the DVD version of ''Isolated Incident'' in November 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jam.canoe.ca/Movies/Artists/C/Cook_Dane/2009/12/09/12091016-sun.html Dane Cook refines comedy act] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120713232657/http://jam.canoe.ca/Movies/Artists/C/Cook_Dane/2009/12/09/12091016-sun.html |date=2012-07-13 }} Jam.canoe.ca&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Cook caused a minor controversy when a joke he made in a comedy club about the [[2012 Aurora shooting]] was recorded and made the news headlines. "So I heard that the guy came into the theater about 25 minutes into the movie. And I don’t know if you’ve seen the movie, but the movie is pretty much a piece of crap… Yeah, spoiler alert. And I know that if none of that would have happened, I’m pretty sure that somebody in that theater, about 25 minutes in, realizing it was a piece of crap, probably was like, ‘Ugh f—king shoot me.’" He later took to Twitter to apologize, "I am devastated by the recent tragedy in Colorado &amp; did not mean to make light of what happened. I made a bad judgment call with my material last night &amp; regret making a joke at such a sensitive time. My heart goes out to all of the families &amp; friends of the victims"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2012/07/27/dane-cook-aurora-shooting-joke|title=Dane Cook jokes about Aurora shooting|work=Entertainment Weekly's EW.com|accessdate=22 August 2015|first=Jeff|last=Labrecque|date=July 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZATGRjj1G4|title=Dane Cook Laugh Factory Jokes about Aurora Colorado Shooting Dark Knight Murders|date=27 July 2012|work=YouTube|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gawker.com/5929595/dane-cook-jokes-about-aurora-shooting-on-stage-less-than-one-week-after-massacre |title=Dane Cook Jokes About Aurora Shooting on Stage Less Than One Week After Massacre |author=Neetzan Zimmerman |publisher=Gawker Media |work=Gawker |accessdate=22 August 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150921203742/http://gawker.com/5929595/dane-cook-jokes-about-aurora-shooting-on-stage-less-than-one-week-after-massacre |archivedate=21 September 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/27/dane-cook-aurora-shooting-joke_n_1710221.html|title=Dane Cook Tells Theater Shooting Joke|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=22 August 2015|date=July 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] aired Cook's ''Troublemaker'' special.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gq.com/blogs/the-feed/2014/10/dane-cook-adresses-haters.html|title=The GQ+A: Dane Cook on His Haters, Regrets, and What Therapy Taught Him|author=Lauren Bans|work=GQ|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Style===
Cook's style is principally "long-form storytelling"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mlive.com/entertainment/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2009/10/dane_cook_finds_humor_in_darke.html Dane Cook finds humor in darkest times on latest tour, coming to Van Andel Arena on Friday] Grand Rapids Press&lt;/ref&gt; and "multipurpose phrases".&lt;ref name="salon2006"/&gt; Cook says his onstage persona is a combination of the personalities of his mom, Donna, and his dad, George. "My mother is like a Looney Tunes cartoon. She's wiggly ... She has the ability to tongue in cheek a lot, and do it in a way where she's being physical. My dad is the polar opposite. He always had a little 'what the fuck' in his voice. Even if he knew nothing about what he was talking about, he could sell it. So I looked at these two extremely funny people and created a style of comedy from absorbing their actions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://punchlinemagazine.com/site/?p=224|title=Dane Cook: All Aboard the Dane Train, '&amp;#39;Punchline'&amp;#39; magazine|publisher=Punchlinemagazine.com|date=2005-11-07|accessdate=2010-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He explains: {{quote|text=I wanted to create a stage persona for myself that allowed me to really speak about anything I want... So I can be a storyteller, I can be jokey, I can be corny, I can be a little vulgar, I can be a lot vulgar. And I'm not afraid to go anywhere to get the point of the joke across, even if I have to just blabber like a retard until it becomes apparent that I'm a retard and that the audience should laugh.}}

===Reception===
Commentators in a variety of media sources have characterized Dane Cook's humor as unfunny.&lt;ref name="abclocal1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="salon2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/12073063/pop_life_the_jokes_on_us "Pop Life: The Joke's on Us: How can any comedian get as famous as Dane Cook has with no jokes?"] by [[Rob Sheffield]], ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', October 19, 2006. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061109110416/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/12073063/pop_life_the_jokes_on_us |date=November 9, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Comedian [[Ron White]] has criticized Dane Cook for his lack of real material and for his inflated ego; saying "[He] does not make me laugh, at all, in any way, shape or form."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bullz-eye.com/entertainment/interviews/2006/ron_white.htm "Ron White Interview" by David Medsker].&lt;/ref&gt; When asked about his opinion of Cook on ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'', comedian [[Nick DiPaolo]] said "he doesn't make me laugh, but that doesn't mean he's not funny."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.howardstern.com/rundown.hs?d=1199336400#11113 |title=Scott the emotional engineer – The Howard Stern Show |publisher=Howardstern.com |date=2008-01-03 |accessdate=2010-05-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100131143147/http://howardstern.com/rundown.hs?d=1199336400 |archivedate=January 31, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On Boston radio station [[WBCN (FM)|WBCN]], Dane Cook was named by radio show [[Toucher and Rich]] to a tournament of the top 16 "Worst Comedians" and, based on listener voting, was voted the "Worst Comedian" of all. In the ''[[Michigan Daily]]'', Elie Zwiebel and co-author Jesse Bean wrote that "he's managed to become one of the most overrated comics ever" and that his act is "boringly stagnant".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.michigandaily.com/content/dane-cook-not-so-much|title=The Michigan Daily, "Dane Cook? Not so much."|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090208152428/http://michigandaily.com/content/dane-cook-not-so-much|archivedate=2009-02-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with [[Jason Tanamor]] of Zoiks! Online, Tanamor asked Cook why he was so despised. Cook stated that he'd had conversations with his therapist, attributing some of the negativity to his alpha demeanor. Add to that, Cook's highly successful career. "Unfortunately, what you find is, you know in your graduating class with the guys you came up with, there's going to be some dudes in front of you that don’t want you catching up, and there's going to be some guys behind you that maybe they’ve never had an opportunity. That, coupled with, like you said, reaching the Billboard charts with ‘Retaliation’ and a lot of people going, ‘Who the fuck does he think he is?’&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.zoiksonline.com/2015/01/exclusive-interview-dane-cook-danecook.html|title=Exclusive Interview: Dane Cook (@danecook) Talks Stand-up, Fans, and Jerry Lewis.|website=www.zoiksonline.com|access-date=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jim Breuer]] talked about Cook's reputation within the comedy industry, saying: "Everyone kills this guy ... Not one comedian comes on [my Sirius radio show] and says 'I'm so happy for him', which is weird. ... They can't stand this poor guy." Breuer went on to say that he personally thinks Cook is a "tremendous performer".&lt;ref name="free-press-release.com"&gt;[http://www.free-press-release.com/news/200611/1163129555.html "Comics Question the Rise of Dane Cook"], ''Free Press Release'', November 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Provenza]] said that he was not a fan of his earlier work, but "...caught a couple of Dane Cook shows at the Laugh Factory in Los Angeles, and he was fantastic", and became a fan because he felt he had "matured".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2009-05-13/entertainment/0905120511_1_dane-cook-arenas-critics/2|title=The hated Dane Cook wins over at least one fellow comic|work=tribunedigital-chicagotribune|accessdate=22 August 2015|date=May 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Accusations of plagiarism====
Comedian [[Joe Rogan]] has claimed that Cook performed a bit on an episode of ''[[Premium Blend]]'' that Rogan had developed on ''I'm Gonna Be Dead Someday'' (sketch titled "Tigers Fucking"), and claimed to have performed the routine earlier in clubs with Cook present.&lt;ref&gt;Rogan, Joe. "[http://media.putfile.com/Joe-Rogan-Exposes-Joke-Thieves Joe Rogan Exposes Dane Cook]" (video). ''Putfile.com''. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070107165030/http://media.putfile.com/Joe-Rogan-Exposes-Joke-Thieves |date=January 7, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other comedians have also accused Cook of stealing their material. A 2007 article in [[Radar (magazine)|''Radar'' magazine]] about joke theft included Rogan's allegations, as well as the allegations of an anonymous "veteran comic" who accused Cook of appropriating one of that comic's "very physical routines", despite a direct request by the comedian that Cook stop using the routine in question.&lt;ref name=getlen&gt;Getlen, Larry. "Take the Funny and Run". ''Radar''.

The piece also noted widespread Internet discussion of the similarity between the bits "Struck by a Vehicle", "Itchy Asshole", and "My Son Optimus Prime", from Cook's 2005 album ''[[Retaliation (Dane Cook album)|Retaliation]]'', and the bits "Guy on a Bike", "Itchy Asshole", and "Kid's Names", from comic [[Louis C.K.]]'s 2001 album ''[[Live in Houston (Louis C.K. album)|Live in Houston]]''.&lt;ref name=getlen /&gt; In 2011, Cook played himself in an episode of ''[[Louie (U.S. TV series)|Louie]]'', scripted by C.K., centering on a fictional encounter between the two comics during which they discuss the controversy.&lt;ref name=ew&gt;"[http://popwatch.ew.com/2011/08/05/dane-cook-settles-joke-stealing-feud-on-louis/ Dane Cook settles Louis C.K. joke-stealing feud on Louie]". ''EW.com''. August 5, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview in 2012, Louis C.K. defended Cook, saying "I don't think he stole from me knowingly... I think he sort of got some of my jokes in his head and got sloppy. He's a good guy and not capable of maleficence."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.laughspin.com/2012/06/18/louis-c-k-on-dane-cook-i-dont-think-he-stole-from-me-knowingly/ Louis C.K. on Dane Cook: 'I don't think he stole from me knowingly'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304111105/http://www.laughspin.com/2012/06/18/louis-c-k-on-dane-cook-i-dont-think-he-stole-from-me-knowingly/ |date=2016-03-04 }}". ''Laughspin''. June 18, 2012. ''"What I wrote for Dane and me on camera represents what each other feels about the situation. The only difference is that he's not angry about it. Neither of us really care. Dane was generous in allowing me to take him to a place of anger and it was funny the way he did it. I don't think he stole from me knowingly, which is what I said in the episode. I think he sort of got some of my jokes in his head and got sloppy. He's a good guy and not capable of maleficence."''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film===
Cook began with small film roles in the late 1990s, including ''[[Mystery Men]]'' as "The Waffler", and opposite [[Dennis Rodman]] in 1999's ''[[Simon Sez]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0168172/|title=Simon Sez (1999)|author=MovieAddict2014|date=12 July 2000|work=IMDb|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rottentomatoes.com&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2010, Cook claimed that he had auditioned for the role of [[Captain America]] for ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]'', although the director, [[Joe Johnston]], did not have him on the short list for the part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/2010/03/09/dane-cook-and-the-jonas-brothers-auditioned-for-captain-america-roles/ |title=Dane Cook and the Jonas Brothers Auditioned for Captain America Roles? |publisher=Slashfilm.com |date=2010-03-09 |accessdate=2010-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
