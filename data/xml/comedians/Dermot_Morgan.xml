'''Dermot John Morgan''' (31 March 1952 – 28 February 1998) was an Irish comedian, actor and previously a [[schoolteacher]], who achieved international recognition for his role as [[Father Ted Crilly]] in the [[Channel 4]] sitcom ''[[Father Ted]]''.

==Early life and education==
Morgan was born on 31 March 1952 in [[Dublin]]. His parents were Donnchadh Morgan, an artist and sculptor with a passion for drama, and Hilda "Holly" Stokes, a "celebrated beauty" from [[Dún Laoghaire]]. Donnchadh died young of an [[aneurysm]], leaving Hilda with four children: Dermot, Paul, Denise, and Ruth, who died in childhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.turtlebunbury.com/history/history_family/hist_family_morgan.html|title=A History of the Morgan Family - Father Ted's Forebears |publisher=turtlebunbury.com|last=Bunbury|first=Turtle|accessdate=8 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was educated at [[Oatlands College]], [[Stillorgan]], and [[University College, Dublin]] (UCD).

==Career==
===Father Trendy and ''The Live Mike''===
Morgan came to prominence as part of the team behind the highly successful [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]] television show ''[[The Live Mike]]'', presented by [[Mike Murphy (Ireland)|Mike Murphy]]. Morgan made his debut in the media on the Morning Ireland radio show produced by Gene Martin, whose sister Ella was the mother of one of Morgan's friends. It was through this contact that Morgan made the break into radio and eventually television. Between 1979 and 1982 Morgan, who had been a teacher at [[St. Michael's College, Dublin|St. Michael's College]], [[Ailesbury Road]], played a range of comic characters who appeared between segments of the show, including Father Trendy, an unctuous trying-to-be-''cool'' [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] priest (inspired by [[Brian D'Arcy|Father Brian D'Arcy]]) given to drawing ludicrous parallels with non-religious life in two-minute 'chats' to camera. His other characters included a [[Gaelic Athletic Association|GAA]] bigot who waved his [[Hurley (stick)|hurley]] stick around aggressively while verbally attacking his pet hates. He lampooned the [[Thomas Davis (Young Irelander)|Thomas Osborne Davis]]' song "[[A Nation Once Again]]" by singing about a dog who saves his [[Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) master by eating a [[grenade]] during a search by notorious British paramilitary unit the [[Black and Tans]]. When the dog farts and the grenade detonates, the British commented: "It must have been something he ate." The song climaxed with the words: "I hope that I shall live to see Fido an Alsatian once again."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQemEN4b7-8 An Alsatian Once Again]&lt;/ref&gt;

Morgan's success led him to leave teaching and become a full-time comedian.

===''Kenny Live''===
Morgan's relationship with [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]] became strained as the station tried without success to make use of what it saw as his considerable but undisciplined talent; a number of pilot shows were never aired. Morgan returned to the screen in the late 1980s playing his past roles and new ones – initially on ''[[Kenny Live]]'', a Saturday chat show presented by [[Pat Kenny]] launched to fill a gap in the schedules when ''[[The Late Late Show (Ireland)|The Late Late Show]]'' moved to a Friday slot. ''Kenny Live'' axed its comedy slot in response to negative public responses to the show's format.

===As a singer: ''Mr Eastwood''===
Morgan released a comedy single, ''Thank You Very Very Much, Mr Eastwood'', in December 1985.&lt;ref name="Independent obit"&gt;{{cite news|first=Anthony|last=Hayward|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/obituary-dermot-morgan-1147951.html|title=Obituary: Dermot Morgan|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=2 March 1998|accessdate=19 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a take on the fawning praise that internationally successful Irish boxer [[Barry McGuigan]] gave his manager, Barney Eastwood, at the end of successive bouts. The single 'featured' lines by McGuigan, [[Ronald Reagan]], [[Bob Geldof]] and [[Pope John Paul II]],&lt;ref&gt;New Island Books, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; and was the [[List of Irish Singles Chart Christmas number ones|Christmas number one]] in the [[Irish singles chart]] in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishcharts.ie/christmas/christmas3.htm|title=The Irish Charts - All there is to know|work=irishcharts.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Scrap Saturday''===
Morgan's biggest Irish broadcasting success occurred in the late 1980s on the Saturday morning radio comedy show ''[[Scrap Saturday]]'',&lt;ref name="Independent obit"/&gt; in which Morgan, co-scriptwriter [[Gerard Stembridge]], Owen Roe and [[Pauline McLynn]] mocked Ireland's political, business and media establishment. The show's treatment of the relationship between the ever-controversial [[Taoiseach]] [[Charles Haughey]] and his press secretary [[PJ Mara]] proved particularly popular, with Haughey's dismissive attitude towards Mara and the latter's adoring and grovelling attitude towards his "Boss ... the greatest Leader, Man of Destiny, Statesman, Titan, a Colossus" winning critical praise.

Morgan pilloried Haughey's propensity for claiming a family connection to almost every part of Ireland he visited by making reference to a famous advertisement for [[Harp (beer)|Harp beer]], which played on the image of someone returning home and seeking friends, especially "Sally O'Brien, and the way she might look at you". In Morgan's version, Haughey visited somewhere in the world and, after a few seconds, the music from the advertisement began playing. At this point, the Taoiseach exclaimed "did I tell you, PJ, about my cousins in ... " before mentioning supposed relatives such as "my cousin François Haughey" (France), "Helmut Haughey" (Germany), "Yassar Haughey" (Palestine) or "Yitzak Haughey" (Israel) to the despairing Mara, who groaned "Ah now Jaysus, Boss, come on now. Ah Jaysus [sigh]!"

The Haughey/Mara "double act" became the star turn in a series that mocked both sides of the political divide, from Haughey and his advisors to opposition [[Fine Gael]] TD [[Michael Noonan]] as [[Limerick]] disk jockey "Morning Noon'an Night". When RTÉ axed the show in the early 1990s a national outcry ensued. Morgan lashed the decision, calling it "a shameless act of broadcasting cowardice and political subservience".{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} An RTÉ spokesman said: "The show is not being axed. It's just not being continued!"{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

In 1991, Morgan received a [[Jacob's Award]] for his contribution to ''Scrap Saturday'' from the Irish national newspaper radio critics.

===''Father Ted''===
Already a celebrity in Ireland, Morgan's big break in Britain came in [[Channel 4]]'s Irish sitcom ''[[Father Ted]]'', which ran for three series from 1995 to 1998. Writers [[Graham Linehan]] and [[Arthur Mathews (writer)|Arthur Mathews]] auditioned many actors for the title role, but Morgan's enthusiasm won him the part.

''Father Ted'' focused on the misadventures of three Irish Roman Catholic priests who live in a parish on the fictional Craggy Island, located off the west coast of Ireland. Father Ted Crilly (Morgan), [[Father Dougal McGuire]] ([[Ardal O'Hanlon]]) and Father Jack Hackett ([[Frank Kelly]]) live chaotically together in Craggy Island's parochial house, along with their housekeeper Mrs Doyle ([[Pauline McLynn]]). The series featured many other supporting characters, including the camp, hyperactive [[Father Noel Furlong]], played by comedian and future talk show host [[Graham Norton]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/character/ch0026082/]&lt;/ref&gt;

The show received widespread popularity around the world and universal critical acclaim, often being labelled as one of the greatest sitcoms ever made. The show made Morgan a household name and won him legions of fans, developing somewhat of a [[cult following]].

====BAFTA Award====
In 1998 ''Father Ted'' show won a [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] award for the best comedy, Morgan won a BAFTA for best actor, and McLynn was named best actress.

===Unreleased works===
Morgan said in an interview with [[Gay Byrne]] on ''The Late Late Show'' in 1996 that he was writing a screenplay entitled ''Miracle of the Magyars'', based on a real-life incident in the 1950s when the [[Archbishop of Dublin (Roman Catholic)|Archbishop of Dublin]] forbade Catholics from attending a football match between the [[Ireland national football team (FAI)|Republic of Ireland]] and [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]] on religious and spiritual grounds. Yugoslavia won the match 4–1. Morgan planned to use [[Hungary]] as the opposing side to Ireland – hence the title. At the time of his death in 1998, he had completed the screenplay but the film was never made.

Morgan's first project after ''Father Ted'' was to be ''Re-united'', a sitcom about two retired footballers sharing a flat in London. According to former manager John Fischer, Morgan was scripting the programme and planned to take the part of "an [[Eamon Dunphy]]-type who had gone on to work in journalism, but had ended up living with an old football pal". [[Mel Smith]] was in talks for the role of the friend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.herald.ie/entertainment/around-town/mel-and-dermot-had-show-lined-up-29442263.html|title=Mel and Dermot had show lined up|work=herald.ie|last=Sweeney|first=Ken|date=23 July 2013|accessdate=26 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morgan had been commissioned to write a drama series for the [[BBC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/lifestyle/the-day-the-laughter-died-26450746.html|title=The day the laughter died|last=Egan|first=Barry|work=[[Irish Independent]]|date=1 Jun 2008|accessdate=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Dermot married Susanne Garmatz, a native of [[Hamburg]], and they had two sons: Don (born 1978) and Rob (born 1980).&lt;ref name=my_dad_was_fr_ted&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/tv-radio/my-dad-was-fr-ted-and-i-still-miss-him-terribly-1661572.html|title=My dad was Fr Ted (and I still miss him terribly)|newspaper=Irish Independent|publisher=Independent News &amp; Media|date=5 March 2009|accessdate=5 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later began a relationship with Fiona Clarke, with whom he had another son, Ben (born 1993).&lt;ref name=my_dad_was_fr_ted/&gt;

A day after recording the [[Going to America|last episode]] of ''Father Ted'', Morgan had a [[heart attack]] while hosting a dinner party at his home in south-west London. He was rushed to the hospital, but died soon afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/ireland-mourns-comic-talent-as-father-ted-actor-dies-aged-45-1147870.html "Ireland mourns comic talent as 'Father Ted' actor dies, aged 45 "]. Retrieved February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
His sister Denise said, "He wasn't feeling great at the end of the meal and I went to the bedroom with him. He had a heart attack and I didn't recognize it.
From my limited training in first aid, I wasn't sure exactly what was happening. The symptoms didn't match what the books said. I said to him 'I think you are okay' and we went back to the table. He apologized for having left the room and the next thing he just collapsed. We tried to resuscitate him but it didn't work. He had a massive heart attack."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/MY+BROTHER+SAID+SORRY,+AND+THEN+HE+COLLAPSED%3B+IT+WAS+A+LONG+ROAD+TO...-a0101554135|title=MY BROTHER SAID SORRY, AND THEN HE COLLAPSED; IT WAS A LONG ROAD TO FAME FOR DERMOT MORGAN.. BUT SUCCESS WAS CUT SHORT BY HUGE HEART ATTACK. – Free Online Library|accessdate=8 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Father Ted'' co-star [[Frank Kelly]], who died 18 years to the day after Morgan,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-35682191/ "'Father Jack' actor Kelly dies aged 77"]&lt;/ref&gt; said, "Dermot's mind was mercurial. I think he was a kind of comedic meteor. He burned himself out."&lt;ref&gt;[http://spiritofgenovia.com/frted/d_morgan/morgan_obit_teleg1.html "Father Ted star Dermot Morgan dies"]. Retrieved February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Morgan's [[Requiem Mass]] in St. Therese's Church in [[Mount Merrion]], south Dublin, was attended by [[Mary McAleese]], [[President of Ireland]], her predecessor [[Mary Robinson]], and by political and church leaders – many of whom had been the targets of his humor in ''Scrap Saturday''. His body was cremated at [[Glasnevin Cemetery]], and its ashes were buried in the family plot in [[Deansgrange Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dmtribute.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/ "Dermot Morgan Tribute"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061217124119/http://www.dmtribute.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/ |date=17 December 2006 }}. dmtribute.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk. Retrieved March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview in 2009, [[Tommy Tiernan]], who acted with Morgan in the final episode of ''Father Ted'', recalled filming the scene in which Ted dances to the ''[[Theme from Shaft]]''. Tiernan continually flubbed his lines and as a result, Morgan was required to perform the dance repeatedly, despite pains in his heart. Tiernan believed this contributed to his fatal heart attack.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/You+killed+Fr+Ted%3B+WHAT+ARDAL+SAID+TO+COMIC+TOMMY+AS+THEY+BURIED+STAR...-a0191366853 "You killed Fr Ted; WHAT ARDAL SAID TO COMIC TOMMY AS THEY BURIED STAR DERMOT".] Retrieved February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2013, a documentary, ''Dermot Morgan – Fearless Funnyman'', aired on [[RTÉ One]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.rte.ie/presspack/2013/12/27/dermot-morgan-fearless-funnyman/|title=DERMOT MORGAN – FEARLESS FUNNYMAN|date=27 December 2013|work=RTÉ |accessdate=2 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
