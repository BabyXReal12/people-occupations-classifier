Audience member problems have included "My boyfriend prefers his Blackberry to me". A pair of "therapists", also played by actors, feature in each week's show and provide scripted and improvised responses to all the "problems".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2009/11/10/9923/r4_series_for_millican |title=R4 series for Millican |work=Chortle |date=10 November 2009 |accessdate=10 November 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091114065112/http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2009/11/10/9923/r4_series_for_millican |archivedate=14 November 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A second series debuted on [[BBC Radio 4 Extra]] on 2 May 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/radio/sarah_millicans_support_group/episodes/2/|title=Sarah Millican's Support Group|publisher=[[British Comedy Guide]]|accessdate=14 June 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013024949/http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/radio/sarah_millicans_support_group/episodes/2/|archivedate=13 October 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
