[[File:Chic Johnson 1954.JPG|thumb|Johnson in 1954.]]
'''Harold Ogden "Chic" Johnson''' (March 15, 1891 – February 28, 1962) was the barrel-chested half of the [[United States|American]] [[comedy]] team of [[Olsen and Johnson]], known for his strangely infectious, high-pitched laugh.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120724080448/http://www.classicimages.com/past_issues/view/?x=/1998/october98/olsenandjohnson.html ''Olsen and Johnson, The Zaniest of the Zanies'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Johnson was born of Swedish descent in [[Chicago]] to John M. and Matilda C. (née Carlson) Johnson.

==Career==
Johnson studied classical piano at the [[Chicago Musical College]]. He dropped out to support himself as a ragtime pianist in various Chicago-area cabarets and vaudeville houses. He broke into show business as a [[ragtime]] pianist and met his partner [[Ole Olsen (comedian)|Ole Olsen]], a violinist, when they were hired by the same band. Following the breakup of the band, they started doing comedy and by 1918 were [[vaudeville]] headliners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title =Biographical Sketch" in "Ole Olsen papers, 1910–1999|publisher=Indiana Historical Society|date=2003-12-01|url=http://www.indianahistory.org/our-collections/collection-guides/ole-olsen-papers-1910-1999.pdf|accessdate=2012-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

O&amp;J were given contracts by [[Warner Bros.]] in 1930 to appear as the [[comic relief]] in a number of musicals including ''[[Oh, Sailor Behave]]'' (1930), ''[[Gold Dust Gertie]]'' (1931) and a lavish [[Technicolor]] version of ''[[Fifty Million Frenchmen]]'' (1931). Unfortunately, 1931 saw a backlash against musicals, and their last two pictures for Warner were released without music. In 1936, they starred in ''Country Gentlemen'' for [[Republic Pictures]], followed by ''All Over Town'' in 1937. Released from their contract, the team returned to the stage. In 1938 Olsen and Johnson produced the Broadway revue ''Streets of Paris'', which starred [[Bobby Clark (comedian)|Bobby Clark]] and introduced the comedy team of [[Bud Abbott]] and [[Lou Costello]] to Broadway audiences.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

Their greatest triumph was as the stars and producers of ''[[Hellzapoppin (musical)|Hellzapoppin]]'', a zany [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] revue, which opened at the [[46th Street Theater]] on September 22, 1938, and ran for a record 1,404 performances. Full of outrageous gags played on stooges planted in the audience (one winner of a so-called raffle had a block of ice placed in his lap) as well as indignities inflicted on actual paying customers, it became a smash hit despite a lukewarm critical reception, thanks in part to the influence of newspaper columnist and radio personality [[Walter Winchell]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americancentury.org/ag_hellzapoppin.pdf  ''The Screamlined Revue! Hellzapoppin'' (The American Century Theater)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303212155/http://www.americancentury.org/ag_hellzapoppin.pdf |date=March 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Hellzapoppin'' was followed by two other Broadway hits. ''Sons o’ Fun'' opened December 1, 1941, just six days before the attack on [[Pearl Harbor]], and ran an impressive 742 performances. ''Laffing Room Only'' opened on December 23, 1944 and ran a respectable 232.

''Hellzapoppin'' was translated into a [[Hellzapoppin' (film)|film]] released in 1941. Assisted by [[Marx Brothers]] screenwriter [[Nat Perrin]], Olsen and Johnson used the film as an opportunity to satirize [[Hollywood]] as well as score some impressive riffs off filmmaking convention. The picture, a movie within a movie within a play within a movie, foreshadowed a style of comedy that would later find its way into the films of [[Mel Brooks]], ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' and [[TV]]’s ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]''. The film is also known for having what many consider to be the finest example of [[swing dancing]] ever put on film, performed by [[Whitey's Lindy Hoppers]] (here billed as the Harlem Congeroo Dancers) with [[Frankie Manning]]. Although the film is tied up in litigation, a Region 2 DVD has been released. Olsen and Johnson's Hollywood career was very much a hit-and-miss affair. ''Hellzapoppin’'', following their string of earlier failures, was then followed in turn by ''Crazy House'', which was then followed by the slick ''Ghost Catchers'', with most of the wildness confined to the comics' nightclub scenes.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

==Later years==
After their final starring movie, ''See My Lawyer'', was released in 1945, the team tried but failed to make its mark on television with ''Fireball Fun-For-All'', a summer replacement for ''[[Texaco Star Theater]]'' starring [[Milton Berle]]. They attempted to make a comeback with one last Broadway revue, ''Pardon Our French'', but the show failed to catch fire and they entered semi-retirement.

With the advent of [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] as a gambling and entertainment mecca, the team was able to find steady work until Johnson became too ill to perform. Chic Johnson died of kidney failure on February 26, 1962 in [[Las Vegas]]. He was buried on March 1, 1962 and eventually joined in an adjacent plot by Ole Olsen in  Palm Desert Memorial cemetery in Las Vegas.
