==Personal life==
McBrayer was born in [[Macon, Georgia]], and moved to [[Conyers, Georgia]] when he was 15. He studied theater administration at the [[University of Evansville]], Indiana.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/06/arts/television/06itzk.html|title=Not-So-Alter Ego of Kenneth the Page, Still Soaking It In |author=Itzkoff, Dave|date=2008-04-06|work= [[The New York Times]] |accessdate=2010-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1995 to 2002 he worked at [[The Second City]] and [[IO Theater]] in Chicago,&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; an experience that introduced him to ''30 Rock'' creator [[Tina Fey]] and prepared him for his role on her show.&lt;ref name="chicago09"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.chicagonow.com/blogs/show-patrol/2009/10/jack-mcbrayer-kenny-the-page-30-rock.html | title= Jack McBrayer or Kenny the Page?

==Career==
McBrayer appeared in over 80 sketches on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'' (2002–04), often lampooning his own [[Southern United States|Southern]] upbringing by playing stereotypical [[hillbilly]] characters. On August 10, 2007 and September 20, 2008 he made cameo appearances on ''Late Night'' playing [[Kenneth Parcell]] from ''30 Rock''. During the first appearance, O'Brien remarked to him, "I thought you were above this now." McBrayer later reprised his role as Kenneth twice (November 24, 2009 and January 13, 2010) after O'Brien's switch to ''[[The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien|The Tonight Show]]'', and appeared on O'Brien's [[The Legally Prohibited from Being Funny on Television Tour|Legally Prohibited From Being Funny on Television Tour]] at stops in [[Eugene, Oregon]], [[Universal City, California]] (on the [[Universal Studios]] lot where O'Brien taped ''Tonight''), and the final tour stop in [[Atlanta]], in his home state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2010/04/conans_first_tour_stop_self-pl.html|title=Conan’s First Tour Stop: Triumph, Self-Pleasuring Pandas, and Spoon|date=2010-04-13|work= [[New York (magazine)|New York]] |accessdate=2010-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deadline.com/2010/04/coanan-back-at-nbc-universal-for-two-nights-bad-ideas-are-being-greenlit-here/|title=Conan Back at NBC Universal (For Two Nights): "Bad Ideas Are Being Greenlit" Here|author=Andreeva, Nellie|date=2010-04-25|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|accessdate=2010-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, he was featured throughout the video for "[[Touch My Body (Mariah Carey song)|Touch My Body]]" by [[Mariah Carey]]. McBrayer said he accidentally hit Carey in the face with a [[Frisbee]] during the shooting for the video.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; McBrayer also appears in the first episode in the fifth season of ''[[Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!]]'' as a spokesman in a spoof advertisement for the fictional "Diarrhea-phragm."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/tim-eric-awesome-show-great-job-season-5-premiere,38658/|title=Tim &amp; Eric Awesome Show, Great Job! - Season 5 premiere|author=Heisler, Steve|date=2010-03-01|work= [[The A.V.

He regularly appears in the skit "Knock Knock Joke of the Day" on the hit children's television show, ''[[Yo Gabba Gabba!]]'' since season 2&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monstersandcritics.com/smallscreen/news/article_1464960.php/Jack_Black_to_guest_star_on_Yo_Gabba_Gabba|title=Jack Black to guest star on Yo Gabba Gabba|author=MacIntyre, April|date=2009-03-16|work=[[Monsters and Critics]]|accessdate=2010-11-13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100811231821/http://www.monstersandcritics.com/smallscreen/news/article_1464960.php/Jack_Black_to_guest_star_on_Yo_Gabba_Gabba|archivedate=2010-08-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and stars in [[Craig McCracken]]'s new TV show ''[[Wander Over Yonder]]'' on the Disney Channel. In the fall of 2012, Jack lent his voice to the Disney animated film ''[[Wreck-It Ralph]]'', playing the title character's close friend and video game opponent Fix-It Felix, Jr. More recently, he has starred alongside [[Los Angeles Clippers]] player [[Blake Griffin]] in [[Kia Motors|Kia]] commercials, and in 2013 appeared in a commercial for [[Barnes &amp; Noble]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} McBrayer's [[Adult Swim]] series ''[[The Jack and Triumph Show]]'' premiered in February 2015.
