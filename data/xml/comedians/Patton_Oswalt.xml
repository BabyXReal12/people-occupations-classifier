==Personal life==
Oswalt married [[true crime]] writer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Oswalt|first=Patton|date=May 3, 2016|title=Patton Oswalt Remembers His Wife, Michelle McNamara: 'She Steered Her Life With Joyous, Wicked Curiosity'|publisher=''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''|url=http://time.com/4316653/patton-oswalt-remembers-michelle-mcnamara|accessdate=August 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and journalist [[Michelle McNamara]] on September 24, 2005. They had one daughter together, Alice, born in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pattonoswalt.com/index.cfm?page=spew&amp;id=135|first=Patton|last=Oswalt|publisher=Patton Oswalt official website|title=Alice Oswalt vs. Jason Statham|date=April 23, 2009|accessdate= April 24, 2016| archivedate=February 28, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100228191451/http://www.pattonoswalt.com/index.cfm?page=spew&amp;id=135|deadurl=no|quote=So let’s make it official — on Wednesday, April 15th, my way-more-brilliant-and-resilient-than-me wife gave birth to our first child — Alice Rigney Oswalt.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 21, 2016, McNamara died in her sleep in the family's [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], home. Her death was attributed to a combination of a previously undiagnosed heart condition and complications from prescribed medication ([[Adderall]], [[Xanax]], and [[Fentanyl]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://ew.com/news/2017/02/03/patton-oswalt-michelle-mcnamara-cause-of-death/&lt;/ref&gt; The season-three finale of ''[[The Goldbergs (2013 TV series)|The Goldbergs]]'' was dedicated to her memory. On August 1, 2016, Oswalt announced that he had been working to complete McNamara's nonfiction book on the [[Golden State Killer]], which was left unfinished at the time of her death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zuckerman|first1=Esther|title=Read This: Patton Oswalt opens up about his grief|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/read-patton-oswalt-opens-about-his-grief-240489|website=The A.V.

Oswalt posted a brief video to [[Instagram]], saying: "I think you got him, Michelle."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/Bh_qQvcjKnH|title=#GoldenStateKiller #IllBeGoneInTheDark #MichelleMcNamara One of the more surreal days of my life.

He was confirmed to be engaged to actress [[Meredith Salenger]] in July 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.com/tv/patton-oswalt-meredith-salenger-engaged/|title=Patton Oswalt's New Fiancée Is the 'Happiest Girl in the Universe' — See Her Ring &amp; Sweet Tribute to His Daughter!|date=July 6, 2017|publisher=|accessdate=July 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were married in November 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/pattonoswalt/status/927209169588912129|title=What’d you guys do yesterday?

In 2013, he teamed up with [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|PETA]] and spoke out against chaining pet dogs, and sent a letter to the mayor and members of the city council of [[Newport News, Virginia]], urging them to ban the practice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peta.org/blog/patton-oswalt-stand-guy-chained-dogs/ "Patton Oswalt: A Stand-Up Guy for Chained Dogs"]. ''[[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|PETA]]'', January 8, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Oswalt is an [[Atheism|atheist]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Koski, Genevieve|title=Interview: Patton Oswalt|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/patton-oswalt,61121/|work=[[The A.V.

It was also referenced by [[Katt Williams]] in the opening act of ''[[The Comedy Central Roast of Flavor Flav]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=''[[Comedy Central Roast#Flavor Flav|The Comedy Central Roast of Flavor Flav]]''|series=[[Comedy Central Roast]]|network=[[Comedy Central]]|date=August 12, 2007|time=8:03–8:09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
