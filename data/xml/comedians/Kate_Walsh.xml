Walsh ran as a candidate with the Unite for Strength party who won six of the 11 Hollywood Division seats which were up for contention in the recent Screen Actor's Guild National Board elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117992472.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1&amp;nid=2563%3C|title=SAG power shifts|last=McNary|first=Dave|date=September 18, 2008|publisher=variety.com|accessdate=December 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Walsh supports pet adoption and frequently campaigns for the cause. On February 7, 2008, she cut the ribbon to a new dog adoption center named Pedigree(R) Dogstore in Times Square.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/article/walsh%20opens%20dog%20adoption%20shelter_1058867 |title=KATE WALSH- WALSH OPENS DOG ADOPTION CENTER |date= February 8, 2008 |publisher=contactmusic.com |accessdate=February 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, Walsh joined the [[Planned Parenthood Federation of America]] (PPFA)'s Board of Advocates, and in 2008 received the PPFA Maggie Award for an Artist who Stands Up for Reproductive Health and Freedom. She has participated in numerous Planned Parenthood activities, including national fundraisers, local Planned Parenthood affiliate events, the PPFA Awards Gala, and lobby day on Capitol Hill promoting the need for comprehensive sex education. In January 2009, she spoke at the Planned Parenthood Presidential Inauguration Brunch in [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plannedparenthood.org/about-us/boards-initiatives/board-advocates-26417.htm |title=Board of Advocates |publisher=Plannedparenthood.org |date= |accessdate=September 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As announced in late 2009, Walsh partnered with the ocean conservancy and advocacy group [[Oceana (non-profit group)|Oceana]] to call for increased [[sea turtle]] protections. She joined experts from the group on a trip to the [[Virgin Islands]] to witness the turtles' hatching and moving to the sea. In her own words: "I want to get the word out and make people aware about the challenges facing sea turtles. I also want to help get legislation enacted to keep harmful fishing techniques to a minimum and help protect the sea turtles."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://na.oceana.org/en/news-media/publications/oceana-newsletter/fall-2009/features/kate-walsh-wants-to-get-sea-turtles-off-the-hook |title=Oceana Newsletter Fall 2009: Kate Walsh Wants to Get Sea Turtles Off The Hook |publisher=Na.oceana.org |date= |accessdate=September 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Walsh referenced Oceana during a September 16, 2010 appearance on ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]''. She told [[Jay Leno]] that her dress was covered in [[sushi]] and [[sashimi]] as an homage to a dress made of beef worn by [[Lady Gaga]] at the [[2010 MTV Video Music Awards]]. While she claimed it was sustainable seafood, Walsh later admitted via her Twitter account that the sushi was fake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/k8_walsh |title=Twitter / Opgeschort |publisher=Twitter.com |date= |accessdate=September 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
She attended a meeting on Capitol Hill in which they marked the one year anniversary since the [[BP oil spill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSyT7naQGgI |title=Actress Kate Walsh: Americans Who Support Offshore Drilling Are 'Misinformed' |publisher=YouTube |date=April 20, 2011 |accessdate=September 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 3, 2012, Walsh spoke in Dubuque, IA during one of President Obama's campaign stops days before Election Day.

During the 2016 election, Walsh was a supporter of Hillary Clinton, publicly endorsing her and campaigning for her several times in California, Arizona, and Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;http://katewalsh.com/post/147976493069/repost-hillaryclinton-imwithher-hillary-has&lt;/ref&gt;
