He went on to study at the [[Long Island University C. W. Post Campus]], earning a Bachelor of Arts in English and Education (with [[Honors student|Honors]]) and Master of Arts in Theater Arts.&lt;ref name=NSA-2/&gt;

==Career==
Rizzo was once an English teacher for the 7th and 8th grade students at [[Babylon (village), New York#Public Schools|West Babylon Junior High School]] in [[West Babylon, New York]], and counselor to students with behavioral problems in the 9th to 12th grades. He later became a comedian,&lt;ref name=PP&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=YsgdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=gGEEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7103,673666&amp;dq=steve-rizzo+comedian&amp;hl=en |title=Night Life: Comedy, Jazz Reign In District Clubs |author=Lenny Litman |publisher=''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'' |newspaper=''[[The Pittsburgh Press]]'' |page=25 |date=June 2, 1983 |accessdate=June 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SM&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=wM8wAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Zt0FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5903,5394952&amp;dq=steve-rizzo+comedian&amp;hl=en |title=Industrial Week |newspaper=''The [[Southeast Missourian]]'' |page=40 |date=September 28, 1997 |accessdate=June 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was roommate to [[Drew Carey]], had [[Dennis Miller]] and [[Rosie O'Donnell]] open shows for him and shared the stage with [[Eddie Murphy]], [[Rodney Dangerfield]], [[Jerry Seinfeld]] and [[Ellen DeGeneres]] before moving on to become a motivational speaker.&lt;ref name=McGraw-Hill&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mcgrawhill.ca/professional/media/business/get-your-shift-together/ |title=Get Your SHIFT Together |publisher=''[[McGraw-Hill]]'' |date=January 24, 2013 |accessdate=June 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rizzo left a promising career of over 18 years in stand-up comedy to pursue a new career in motivational speaking; he became a professional speaker in 1994.&lt;ref name=Speaker/&gt;

As a stand-up comic, Rizzo performed at various [[comedy club]]s, including the Pittsburgh Comedy Club in [[Dormont, Pennsylvania|Dormont]] and [[the Improv]].&lt;ref name=PP/&gt; He also was featured in many television comedy shows, including [[The Improv|An Evening at the Improv]], [[Showtime (TV channel)|Showtime]] [[Television special|Special]], [[The Comedy Channel (United States)|The Comedy Channel]] and [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox TV's]] ''[[Comic Strip Live (TV series)|Comic Strip Live]]''.&lt;ref name=NSA-2/&gt;&lt;ref name=TBB/&gt; In ''[[The Pittsburgh Press]]'' of June 2, 1983, Lenny Litman described Rizzo's comedy style as "whip-cracking satire cushioned with warm and funny stories."&lt;ref name=PP/&gt;

While Rizzo was transitioning from being a stand-up comedian to a [[motivational speaking|motivational speaker]], after one of his shows at a New Jersey comedy club, he met Al Parinello, president of the [[National Speakers Association]] (NSA)—New Jersey chapter, he encouraged Rizzo to attend a workshop of the [[National Speakers Association]]. After the workshop, Rizzo was asked to present ''How to Add Humor to Your Presentations'' at a national convention of the [[National Speakers Association]]. At this transitioning period, Rizzo also met Nancy Lauterbach, the founder of Five Star Speakers and Trainers after a show in [[Orlando, Florida]], and according to Kelli Vrla in ''Speaker'' (a publication of [[National Speakers Association]]) of September 2010, "she took him under her wing and helped him structure his presentation. In his first showcase, Rizzo ranked dead last out of 23 speakers because he tried to sound like a "serious motivational speaker." He soon realized his humor was the key to his authenticity. "I was light years ahead of many professional speakers because I had command of an audience," Rizzo says. When Rizzo incorporated humor in his next showcase, buyers immediately hired him. He signed an exclusive agreement with Five Star, and his speaking business took off. Rizzo credits Lauterbach with helping him establish a foothold in his new career."&lt;ref name=Speaker/&gt;

Rizzo had a [[PBS]] [[Television special|Special]] which he created by himself, and he was also the executive producer.&lt;ref name=NSA-2/&gt; In an article published on December 08, 2006 by [[Oprah Radio]] (via [[The Oprah Winfrey Show|Oprah.com]]), [[Mehmet Oz]] wrote that "Steve Rizzo is the author of ''Becoming a Humor Being'', and the creator and executive producer of his own nationally syndicated PBS special. After doing stand-up comedy for many years, Steve transitioned to being a professional humorist speaker."&lt;ref name=Oprah&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oprah.com/oprahradio/Laughter-is-the-Best-Medicine |title=Laughter is the Best Medicine |author=Dr. Mehmet Oz |author-link=Mehmet Oz |publisher=[[Oprah Radio]] |via=[[The Oprah Winfrey Show|Oprah.com]] |date=December 8, 2006 |accessdate=June 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A publication by [[McGraw-Hill]] (introducing Rizzo's book, ''Get Your SHIFT Together: How to Think, Laugh, and Enjoy Your Way to Success in Business and in Life'') says, "[Rizzo reaches] well over 50,000 people a year through his talks and weekly Rizzo-Gram e-mails."&lt;ref name=McGraw-Hill/&gt;

==Affiliations==
