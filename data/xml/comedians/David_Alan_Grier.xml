He is best known for his work on the [[sketch comedy]] television show ''[[In Living Color]]''.

==Early life==
One of three children,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/david-alan-grier-21129777|title=David Alan Grier|website=Biography|language=en-us|access-date=2017-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grier was born in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], the son of mother Aretas Ruth ([[married and maiden names|née]] Blaney), a school teacher, and father William Henry Grier, a psychiatrist and writer who co-wrote the book ''[[Black Rage (book)|Black Rage]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/87/David-Alan-Grier.html|title=David Alan Grier Biography (1955?-)|website=www.filmreference.com|language=eng|access-date=2017-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grier graduated from Detroit's magnet high school, [[Cass Tech]], and received a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] from the [[University of Michigan]], and an [[Master of Fine Arts|M.F.A.]] from the [[Yale School of Drama]] in 1981.

When Grier was young, his family marched with [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] in a [[March on Poverty]] in Detroit, where King gave an early version of the "[[I Have A Dream]]" speech.&lt;ref name=LarryKingNow-DAG-2014&gt;{{cite web|last1=King|first1=Larry|title=David Alan Grier|url=http://www.ora.tv/larrykingnow/david-alan-grier-0_62qxamqqb42y|website=Larry King Now|accessdate=9 August 2014|format=Video interview|date=19 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Immediately after graduating from Yale, Grier landed the role of [[Jackie Robinson]] in the short-lived [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musical ''[[The First (musical)|The First]]'', directed by [[Martin Charnin]] and written by [[Joel Siegel]].

Grier got his start on the [[National Public Radio]] radio drama adaptation of ''[[Star Wars]]'' in 1981. He was the voice of a nameless [[X-wing]] fighter pilot during the [[Battle of Yavin]].

Grier was nominated for a [[Tony Award]] for Best Featured Actor in a Musical and won the [[Theatre World Award]] for ''[[The First (musical)|The First]]''. He later starred as James "Thunder" Early in the hit Broadway musical ''[[Dreamgirls]]''. Grier made his film debut in 1983 in ''[[Streamers (film)|Streamers]]'', directed by [[Robert Altman]]. He won the [[Golden Lion]] for Best Actor at the [[Venice Film Festival]] for the film. He also appeared in the [[Negro Ensemble Company]] production ''[[A Soldier's Play]]'' and reprised his role in the film version ''[[A Soldier's Story]]''. Grier also appeared as a [[geology]] professor at the fictitious Hillman College in the show ''[[A Different World (TV series)|A Different World]]'' where he was a crush of several of the girls on the show including lead character [[Denise Huxtable]] played by actress [[Lisa Bonet]].

===''In Living Color''===
Although primarily known for his dramatic work, Grier began to shift towards comedy, making memorable appearances in the [[cult films]] ''[[Amazon Women on the Moon]]'' and ''[[I'm Gonna Git You Sucka]]''. [[Keenen Ivory Wayans]], the director of ''Sucka'', cast Grier in his new [[variety show]] ''[[In Living Color]]''. It became a ratings hit and won an [[Emmy]] for Outstanding Variety Series. Grier became a popular cast member through his characters, which ranged from hyperactive children to crotchety old men. Among his prominent characters were obnoxious, megaphone-blaring shop teacher Al MacAfee; the elderly Mr. Brooks, whose autumn years are a never-ending verbal battle with his wife; [[Calhoun Tubbs]], a blues musician with very limited creativity; a member of Funky Finger Productions, a production company with more ambition than resources; Tiny, a prison inmate obsessed with female "breastses"; and, perhaps most famously, flamboyant and effeminate Antoine Merriweather in the "[[Men on...]]" sketch series. He also played Rev. Leon Lonnie Love on the TV series ''[[Martin (TV series)|Martin]]''. After his success on the show, Grier began appearing in comedies such as ''[[Boomerang (1992 film)|Boomerang]]'' (as [[Eddie Murphy]]'s shy friend Gerard), ''[[Blankman]]'' (with [[Damon Wayans]]), ''[[In the Army Now (film)|In the Army Now]]'' (as Fred Ostroff) along with [[Pauly Shore]] and [[Andy Dick]] in 1994, and as a policeman whose car is memorably crushed and eaten by a giant pod in ''[[Jumanji]]''. Grier appeared with Tom Arnold in the 1997 comedy ''[[McHale's Navy (1997 film)|McHale's Navy]]'' as Ensign Charles Parker. In 1999, he made a guest appearance as himself in the "Aw, Here it Goes to Hollywood" episode of [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]]'s sitcom, ''[[Kenan &amp; Kel]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb episode|619382|Aww, Here It Goes to Hollywood: Part 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Acting career ===
After the cancellation of ''In Living Color'', Grier starred in the short-lived [[sitcom]]s ''[[The Preston Episodes]]'', ''[[Damon (TV series)|Damon]]'' (with ''In Living Color'' co-star [[Damon Wayans]]), and ''[[DAG (U.S. TV series)|DAG]]''.

Grier had a cameo in the Robert De Niro and Edward Burns movie ''15 Minutes'' as a Central Park mugger. In a departure from the childlike roles he often played on ''In Living Color'', he portrayed an abusive father in [[Rusty Cundieff]]'s anthology film ''[[Tales from the Hood]]''. He began doing [[stand-up comedy]] and began hosting the [[Comedy Central]] series ''[[Premium Blend]]''. He was ranked no. 94 on Comedy Central 100 Greatest Stand-Ups.

Grier returned to Broadway to perform in the musical ''[[A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum]]''. In 2002, Grier joined the cast of the improv-based [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] sitcom and [[Bonnie Hunt]] vehicle ''[[Life with Bonnie]]'' which ran only two seasons. During this time, he continued to appear in comedy films but also returned to drama in the films ''[[Baadasssss!]]''  and ''[[The Woodsman (2004 film)|The Woodsman]]''. He starred in his own Comedy Central stand-up special ''The Book of David: The Cult Figure's Manifesto''. He is also a frequent guest on the Comedy Central show ''[[Crank Yankers]]''. Grier was the host of the [[NBC]] show ''[[Thank God You're Here (U.S. TV series)|Thank God You're Here]].'' He also appeared in the revival production of ''[[The Wiz]]'' at the [[La Jolla Playhouse]] directed by [[Des McAnuff]].

Grier starred in ''[[Gym Teacher: The Movie]]'' playing the villain, Shelly Bragg. He appeared as [[Uncle Henry (The Oz Books)|Uncle Henry]] in the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] 2005 television movie ''[[The Muppets' Wizard of Oz]]''.

In October 2008, Grier hosted ''[[Chocolate News]]'', a Comedy Central spoof of a TV news magazine show.  Comedy Central did not renew the show for a second season.

Grier appeared as Sugar Bear in the 2009 movie ''[[Dance Flick]]''. He also provided the voice for [[Kobe Bryant]] in the [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] puppet commercials.

He returned to [[Broadway theater|Broadway]] for the premiere of ''[[Race (Mamet play)|Race]]'', written and directed by [[David Mamet]], opposite [[James Spader]], [[Kerry Washington]], and [[Richard Thomas (actor)|Richard Thomas]], which opened at the [[Ethel Barrymore Theatre]] on December 6, 2009.  Grier received his second [[Tony Award]] nomination for his role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/139245-2010-Tony-Nominations-Announced-Fela-and-La-Cage-Top-List |title=2010 Tony Nominations Announced; Fela! and La Cage Top List |accessdate=2010-05-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100506062107/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/139245-2010-Tony-Nominations-Announced-Fela-and-La-Cage-Top-List |archivedate=2010-05-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grier most recently appeared on Broadway as Sportin' Life in the Gershwins' ''[[Porgy and Bess]]'', which opened at the [[Richard Rodgers Theatre]] on January 12, 2012, alongside [[Norm Lewis]] and [[Audra McDonald]]. He was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Performance by a Featured Actor in a Musical for this role.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.broadway.com/buzz/awards/tony-awards/nominees/275/david-alan-grier/|title=David Alan Grier|work=Broadway.com|access-date=2017-04-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to his Tony Award nomination, Grier received a 2013 [[Grammy]] nomination for Best Musical Theater Album for his performance on the cast recording of the play.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.grammy.com/nominees?genre=19|title=59th Annual GRAMMY Awards Winners &amp; Nominees|work=GRAMMY.com|access-date=2017-04-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grier guest-starred in [[Bones (season 6)|Season 6]] of FOX's ''[[Bones (TV series)|Bones]]''. He played Professor Bunsen Jude the Science Dude, the host of a children's TV program. This character was inspired by [[Bill Nye]] "the Science Guy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Bones-David-Alan-Grier-1021996.aspx|title=Bones Exclusive: David Alan Grier to Woo Brennan?|publisher=TVGuide.com|accessdate=August 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2013, Grier appeared in ''[[Tyler Perry Presents Peeples]]'', playing the role of Virgil Peeples, alongside [[Kerry Washington]] and [[Craig Robinson (actor)|Craig Robinson]].  Also in 2013, Grier appeared in ''The Watsons Go To Birmingham'', a [[Hallmark Channel]] adaptation of [[Christopher Paul Curtis]]' 1995 [[Newbery Medal|Newbery Honor]]-winning novel, ''[[The Watsons Go to Birmingham – 1963]]''.

Grier appeared on the [[CBS]] TV-adaptation of ''[[Bad Teacher (TV series)|Bad Teacher]]'', playing the role of principal Carl Gaines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/bad-teacher-cbs-david-alan-grier-421988 | work=The Hollywood Reporter | title=David Alan Grier to Play Principal in CBS' 'Bad Teacher' | date=February 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series also featured actors [[Sara Gilbert]], [[Ryan Hansen]], [[Kristin Davis]], and Sara Rodier.

He played the [[Cowardly Lion]] in [[The Wiz Live!|NBC's live performance]] of ''[[The Wiz]]'', which aired on December 3, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/08/04/nbcs-wiz-live-casts-david-alan-grier-cowardly-lion|title=NBC's 'The Wiz Live!' finds its Cowardly Lion|first=Emily|last=Blake|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=August 4, 2015|accessdate=October 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Loveline''===
He was often referred to as the third host of the radio show ''[[Loveline]]'', as he was a frequent guest and guest host (usually filling in for Adam Carolla). One of his most famous contributions was a bit where he began calling out various pharmaceutical drugs Dr. Drew was recommending to a caller as though they were the names of black children being yelled at by their parents. The episode aired on September 7, 2005, towards the end of the show.

{{cquote|[[ethinylestradiol|Ethinyl, Estradiol]], [[Norethindrone]] y'all get in the house!  And where is [[Levonorgestrel]]!?}}

In another notable episode - that of September 25, 2002 - Grier stopped by to lament his recent breakup with his girlfriend of four years. He had just found out she had been cheating on him with several famous actors; he coughed while saying the names to avoid legal difficulties. During the show Engineer Anderson slowed down the recording and played it back, and the listeners were able to discern the names [[Tom Sizemore]], [[Colin Farrell]], and [[Cuba Gooding Jr.]].

Grier's supposed last appearance on ''Loveline'' was April 16, 2006. On his [[MySpace]] page, Grier posted:
{{cquote|To all of my loyal fans. It pains me greatly to inform you all that I will probably never be heard on the radio show Loveline again. I have been informed of this sad fact by the one and only Dr. [[Drew Pinsky]]. I know not how or why this has happened, but we must ALL move on...}}

On March 3, 2009, Grier was a guest on ''[[The Adam Carolla Podcast]]''. He explained that the reason he was not asked back on ''Loveline'' was that the producers of the show did not want him back on despite Dr. Drew pressing for him to continue to be a guest. While Dr. Drew was not open with him about this at the beginning, Grier felt no resentment toward him and Dr. Drew has since apologized for what happened.  Shortly thereafter, Dr. Drew explained what had happened on ''Loveline'' and expressed his intent to petition the producers for Grier to return. On August 10, 2009, after a gap of over three years, Grier was once again on ''Loveline'', joining former host [[Adam Carolla]] and [[Bruce Heischober|Dr. Bruce Heischober]].

===''The Adam Carolla Show''===
Grier has made many guest appearances on the ''[[The Adam Carolla Show (podcast)|Adam Carolla Show]]'', usually to plug his improv performances. One of his recurring bits is where he enacts a heavy-set black woman named Peanut who does a terrible job answering the phones for ''The Adam Carolla Show''. He also frequently antagonized the former co-host [[Alison Rosen]]. He did this by snoring loudly while Alison read the news and also by referring to her as "Teresa" or "Fake Teresa," the name of Alison's predecessor [[Teresa Strasser]].

===''Dancing with the Stars''===
David was a contestant on the [[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. season 8)|8th season]] of ''[[Dancing with the Stars]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://tvwatch.people.com/2009/02/09/dancing%E2%80%99s-season-eight-cast-is-revealed/ "Dancing’s Season Eight Cast Is Revealed! - PEOPLE TV Watch"], 2009-02-09&lt;/ref&gt; partnered with [[Kym Johnson]]. By the fourth week of the competition, Grier announced that he had lost 26 pounds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usmagazine.com/news/dancing-with-the-star-contestant-loses-26-pounds+-2009313 "Dancing with the Stars Contestant Loses 26 Pounds"] ''Us Weekly'', March 31, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; He was eliminated in the fifth week.
