'''Henry Lawrence Garfield''' (born February 13, 1961), better known by his stage name '''Henry Rollins''', is an American musician, actor, writer, television and radio host, and comedian.&lt;ref name="laweekly"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undertheradar.co.nz/utr/tour/id/905/title/Henry-Rollins.utr |title=Henry Rollins - Tours at Undertheradar |publisher=Undertheradar.co.nz |date= |accessdate=2014-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Henry Rollins - punk with a passion for politics|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/hardtalk/4242901.stm|publisher=BBC News - Hardtalk Extra|date=7 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; He hosts a weekly radio show on [[KCRW]], and is a regular columnist for ''[[Rolling Stone Australia]]'' and was a regular columnist for ''[[LA Weekly]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kcrw.com/people/henry-rollins |title=Henry Rollins — KCRW |publisher=Kcrw.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After performing in the short-lived [[Washington, D.C.]] band [[State of Alert]] in 1980, Rollins fronted the California [[hardcore punk]] band [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]] from August 1981 until mid-1986. Following the band's breakup, Rollins established the [[record label]] and publishing company [[2.13.61]] to release his spoken word albums, and formed the [[Rollins Band]], which toured with a number of lineups from 1987 until 2003, and during 2006.

Since Black Flag disbanded, Rollins has hosted numerous radio shows, such as ''Harmony in My Head'' on [[Indie 103]], and television shows such as ''[[The Henry Rollins Show]]'', MTV's ''[[120 Minutes]]'', and ''[[Jackass (TV series)|Jackass]]''. He had recurring dramatic roles in the second season of ''[[Sons of Anarchy]]'', in the final seasons of the animated series ''[[The Legend of Korra]]'' as [[Zaheer (The Legend of Korra)|Zaheer]], and has also had roles in several films. Rollins has campaigned for various political causes in the United States, including promoting [[LGBT rights in the United States|LGBT rights]], [[World Hunger Relief]], the [[West Memphis Three]] and an [[Peace movement|end to war]] in particular.

==Early and personal life==
Rollins was born in [[Washington, D.C.]], the only child of Iris and Paul Garfield.&lt;ref name="Biography"/&gt;&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-06-14/magazine/tm-7341_1_henry-rollins/2|title=The Angriest Man in Los Angeles :  Rock Poet Henry Rollins Doesn't Drink, Smoke or Do Drugs--He Just Burns|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=January 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newstimes.com/news/article/Life-on-road-suits-Rollins-fine-263878.php |title=Life on road suits Rollins fine |publisher= The News Times (Danbury, CT)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comeinandburn.com/archive/hqmay97.htm |title=An Unofficial Henry Rollins &amp; Rollins Band Website |publisher=Come In And Burn |date= |accessdate=2014-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rollins is of [[Jewish]] ancestry through his father.

Little Brown and Company, 2001. {{ISBN|0-316-78753-1}}. p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; In the fourth grade, he was diagnosed with [[hyperactivity]] and took [[Methylphenidate|Ritalin]] for several years so that he could focus during school. He attended [[The Bullis School]], then an all-male preparatory school in [[Potomac, Maryland]].&lt;ref name="Biography"/&gt;  According to Rollins, the Bullis School helped him to develop a sense of discipline and a strong work ethic.&lt;ref name="a25" /&gt; It was at Bullis that he began writing.&lt;ref name="ayad" /&gt; In 1987, Rollins said he had not seen his father since he was 18.&lt;ref name="latimes"/&gt;

Rollins does not have religious or spiritual beliefs, but he does not consider himself an [[atheist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2017-05-28|title=Henry Rollins: Why I'm Not an Atheist|first=Henry|last=Rollins|publicationdate=2015-02-26|date=2015-02-17|url=http://www.laweekly.com/music/henry-rollins-why-im-not-an-atheist-5403137|website=LA Weekly|location=Los Angeles, California|deadurl=no|archivedate=2015-02-27|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227194455/http://www.laweekly.com/music/henry-rollins-why-im-not-an-atheist-5403137}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has mostly avoided recreational drugs throughout his life, including alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2017-05-28|publicationdate=2017-05-11|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/features/how-henry-rollins-became-a-drug-free-pot-advocate-w481602|title=How Henry Rollins Became a Drug-Free Pot Advocate|first=Serena|last=Markstrom Nugent|website=Rolling Stone|location=Eugene, Oregon|archivedate=2017-05-12|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170512015017/http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/features/how-henry-rollins-became-a-drug-free-pot-advocate-w481602|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2017-05-28|url=http://www.comeinandburn.com/archive/fhm697.htm|archivedate=2005-02-20|title= Quote, Unquote: Henry Rollins|publicationdate=June 1997|first=Ivor|last=Baddiel|magazine=[[FHM]]|quote=''Q'': You're well-known for imploring audiences not to destroy themselves with alcohol and tobacco, but have you ever had a pint and a Castella?&lt;br/&gt;''Henry Rollins'': Never had a cigar.

==Music career==

===State of Alert===
{{Main|State of Alert}}
After high school, Rollins attended [[American University]] in Washington D.C. for one semester, but dropped out in December 1979.&lt;ref name="latimes"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dailyuw.com/news/1996/nov/27/an-interview-with-henry-rollins/ |title=An Interview With Henry Rollins &amp;#124; The Daily |publisher=Dailyuw.com |date=1996-11-27 |accessdate=2012-10-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120708041440/http://dailyuw.com/news/1996/nov/27/an-interview-with-henry-rollins/ |archivedate=July 8, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He began working minimum-wage jobs, including a job as a courier for kidney samples at the [[National Institutes of Health]].&lt;ref name="popenter"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.popentertainment.com/henryrollins.htm |title=Henry Rollins interview |accessdate=2007-08-14 |author=Sklar, Ronald |publisher=PopEntertainment.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rollins developed an interest in [[punk rock]] after he and his friend [[Ian MacKaye]] procured a copy of [[The Ramones]]' eponymous [[Ramones (album)|debut album]]; he later described it as "akin to shooting heroin." From 1979 to 1980, Rollins was working as a roadie for Washington bands, including [[Teen Idles]]. When the band's singer Nathan Strejcek failed to appear for practice sessions, Rollins convinced the Teen Idles to let him sing. Word of Rollins's ability spread around the punk rock scene in Washington; [[Bad Brains]] singer [[H.R.]] would sometimes get Rollins on stage to sing with him.&lt;ref name="a26"&gt;Azerrad, 2001. p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, the Washington punk band the Extorts lost their frontman [[Lyle Preslar]] to [[Minor Threat]]. Rollins joined the others of the band to form State of Alert (S.O.A.), and became its frontman and vocalist. He put words to the band's five songs and wrote several more. S.O.A. recorded their sole EP, ''No Policy'', and released it in 1981 on MacKaye's [[Dischord Records]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p442659|pure_url=yes}} |title=State of Alert &gt; Overview |accessdate=2007-08-16 |author=DePasquale, Ron |publisher=Allmusic}}&lt;/ref&gt; S.O.A. disbanded after a total of a dozen concerts and one EP. Rollins had enjoyed being the band's frontman, and had earned a reputation for fighting in shows. He later said, "I was like nineteen and a young man all full of steam and ''loved'' to get in the dust-ups." By this time, Rollins had become the assistant manager of the Georgetown [[Häagen-Dazs]] ice cream store; his steady employment had helped to finance the S.O.A. EP.&lt;ref name="a27"&gt;Azerrad, 2001. p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

===Black Flag===
{{Main|Black Flag (band)}}

In 1980, a friend gave Rollins and MacKaye a copy of Black Flag's ''[[Nervous Breakdown (EP)|Nervous Breakdown]]'' EP. Rollins soon became a fan of the band, exchanging letters with bassist [[Chuck Dukowski]] and later inviting the band to stay in his parents' home when Black Flag toured the East Coast in December 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Azzerad, 2001. p. 27-28&lt;/ref&gt; When Black Flag returned to the East Coast in 1981, Rollins attended as many of their concerts as he could. At an impromptu show in a New York bar, Black Flag's vocalist [[Dez Cadena]] allowed Rollins to sing "Clocked In", a song Rollins had asked the band to play in light of the fact that he had to drive back to Washington, D.C. to begin work.&lt;ref name="a28"&gt;Azerrad, 2001. p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

Unbeknownst to Rollins, Cadena wanted to switch to guitar, and the band was looking for a new vocalist.&lt;ref name="a28" /&gt; The band was impressed with Rollins' singing and stage demeanor, and the next day, after a semi-formal audition at Tu Casa Studio in New York City, they asked him to become their permanent vocalist. Despite some doubts, he accepted, in part because of MacKaye's encouragement. His high level of energy and intense personality suited the band's style, but Rollins' diverse tastes in music were a key factor in his being selected as singer; Black Flag's founder [[Greg Ginn]] was growing restless creatively and wanted a singer who was willing to move beyond simple, three-chord punk.&lt;ref name="a29"&gt;Azerrad, 2001. p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Black Flag logo.svg|thumb|200px|right|The band's logo was created by artist [[Raymond Pettibon]]]]
After joining Black Flag in 1981, Rollins quit his job at Häagen-Dazs, sold his car, and moved to Los Angeles. Upon arriving in Los Angeles, Rollins got the Black Flag logo [[tattoo]]ed on his left biceps&lt;ref name="popenter" /&gt; and also on the back of his neck, chose the stage name of Rollins, a surname he and MacKaye had used as teenagers.&lt;ref name="a29" /&gt; Rollins played his first show with Black Flag on August 21, 1981 at Cuckoo's Nest in Costa Mesa, California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Black Flag at the Cuckoo's Nest|url=http://www.itallhappened.com/black-flag-at-the-cuckoos-nest-1981-08-21|work=It All Happened - A Living History of Live Music|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101030125/http://www.itallhappened.com/black-flag-at-the-cuckoos-nest-1981-08-21|archivedate=January 1, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rollins was in a different environment in Los Angeles; the police soon realized he was a member of Black Flag, and he was hassled as a result. Rollins later said: "That really scared me. It freaked me out that an adult would do that. [...] My little eyes were opened big time."&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad, 2001. p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

Before concerts, as the others of the band tuned up, Rollins would stride about the stage dressed only in a pair of black shorts, grinding his teeth; to focus before the show, he would squeeze a pool ball.&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad, 2001. p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; His stage persona impressed several critics; after a 1982 show in [[Anacortes, Washington]], ''Sub Pop'' critic [[Calvin Johnson (musician)|Calvin Johnson]] wrote: "Henry was incredible. Pacing back and forth, lunging, lurching, growling; it was all real, the most intense emotional experiences I have ever seen."&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad, 2001. p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1983, Rollins' stage persona was increasingly alienating him from the rest of Black Flag. During a show in England, Rollins assaulted a member of the audience who attacked Ginn; Ginn later scolded Rollins, calling him a "macho asshole".&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad, 2001. p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; A legal dispute with [[Unicorn Records]] held up further Black Flag releases until 1984, and Ginn was slowing the band's tempo down so that they would remain innovative. In August 1983, guitarist [[Dez Cadena]] had left the band; a stalemate lingered between Dukowski and Ginn, who wanted Dukowski to leave, before Ginn fired Dukowski outright.&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad, 2001. p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; 1984's [[heavy metal music]]-influenced ''[[My War]]'' featured Rollins screaming and wailing throughout many of the songs; the band's members also grew their hair to confuse the band's hardcore punk audience.&lt;ref name="a47"&gt;Azerrad, 2001. p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

Black Flag's change in musical style and appearance alienated many of their original fans, who focused their displeasure on Rollins by punching him in the mouth, stabbing him with pens, or scratching him with their nails, among other methods. He often fought back, dragging audience members on stage and assaulting them. During a Black Flag concert, Rollins repeatedly punched a fan in the face who had continuously reached for his microphone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reilly|first1=Dan|title=10 Concert Fights Caught on Tape|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/10-concert-fights-caught-on-tape-20130625|website=Rolling Stone|accessdate=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rollins became increasingly alienated from the audience; in his tour diary, Rollins wrote "When they spit at me, when they grab at me, they aren't hurting me. When I push out and mangle the flesh of another, it's falling so short of what I really want to do to them."&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad, 2001. p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; During the Unicorn legal dispute, Rollins had started a weight-lifting program, and by their 1984 tours, he had become visibly well-built; journalist [[Michael Azerrad]] later commented that "his powerful physique was a metaphor for the impregnable emotional shield he was developing around himself."&lt;ref name="a47" /&gt; &lt;!-- Get in the Van book release? --&gt; Rollins has since replied that "no, the training was just basically a way to push myself."&lt;ref name="smhinterview"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/gig-reviews/henry-rollins/2008/04/03/1206851089537.html |title=Henry Rollins interview |accessdate=2008-04-04 |author=Jensen, Erik|work=Sydney Morning Herald | date=2008-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before Black Flag disbanded in August 1986, Rollins had already toured as a solo spoken word artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seattleweekly.com/2003-01-08/music/lip-service.php |title=Lip Service – Henry Rollins |accessdate=2007-09-14 |author=Waggoner, Eric |publisher=[[Seattle Weekly]] |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071014220714/http://seattleweekly.com/2003-01-08/music/lip-service.php |archivedate = October 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He released two solo records in 1987, ''[[Hot Animal Machine]]'', a collaboration with guitarist [[Chris Haskett]], and ''[[Drive by Shooting]]'', recorded as "Henrietta Collins and the Wifebeating Childhaters";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shsu.edu/~lis_fwh/book/punk_newwave_postpunk/support/Rollins.htm |title=Henry Rollins/Black Flag |accessdate=2007-09-09 |author=Hoffmann, Frank |publisher=Survey of American Popular Music}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rollins also released his second spoken word album, ''[[Big Ugly Mouth]]'' in the same year. Along with Haskett, Rollins soon added [[Andrew Weiss (guitarist)|Andrew Weiss]] and [[Sim Cain]], both former members of Ginn's side-project [[Gone (band)|Gone]], and called the new group Rollins Band. The band toured relentlessly,&lt;ref name="amgrollins"&gt;{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p191773|pure_url=yes}} |title=Rollins Band &gt; Biography |accessdate=2007-08-22 |author=Prato, Greg |publisher=Allmusic}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their 1987 debut album, ''[[Life Time (Rollins Band album)|Life Time]]'', was quickly followed by the outtakes and live collection ''Do It''. The band continued to tour throughout 1988; in 1989 another Rollins Band album, ''[[Hard Volume]]'' was released.&lt;ref name="amghenry"&gt;{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p5299|pure_url=yes}} |title=Henry Rollins &gt; Biography |accessdate=2007-08-22 |author=Huey, Steve |publisher=Allmusic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another live album, ''Turned On'', and another spoken word release, ''Live at McCabe's'', followed in 1990.

In 1991, the Rollins Band signed a distribution deal with Imago Records and appeared at the [[Lollapalooza]] festival; both improved the band's presence. However, in December 1991, Rollins and his best friend [[Joe Cole (roadie)|Joe Cole]] were accosted by two armed robbers outside Rollins's home. Cole was murdered by a gunshot to the head, Rollins escaped without injury but police suspected him in the murder and detained him for ten hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edwebproject.org/rollins.html |title=Primal Scream: Henry Rollins speaks |accessdate=2007-09-08 |author1=Carvin, Andy |author2=Crone, Chris |publisher=EdWebProject.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although traumatized by Cole's death, as chronicled in his book ''Now Watch Him Die'', Rollins continued to release new material; the spoken-word album ''[[Human Butt]]'' appeared in 1992 on his own record label, [[2.13.61]]. The Rollins Band released ''[[The End of Silence]]'', Rollins's first charting album.&lt;ref name="amghenry" /&gt;

The following year, Rollins released a spoken-word double album, ''The Boxed Life''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r77934|pure_url=yes}} |title=The Boxed Life &gt; Overview |accessdate=2007-08-23 |author=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas |publisher=Allmusic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Rollins Band embarked upon the ''End of Silence'' tour; bassist Weiss was fired towards its end and replaced by funk and jazz bassist [[Melvin Gibbs]]. According to critic Steve Huey, 1994 was Rollins's "breakout year".&lt;ref name="amghenry" /&gt; The Rollins Band appeared at [[Woodstock 94]] and released ''[[Weight (album)|Weight]]'', which ranked on the Billboard Top 40. Rollins released ''[[Get in the Van|Get in the Van: On the Road with Black Flag]]'', a double-disc set of him reading from his Black Flag tour diary of the same name; he won the Grammy for [[Best Spoken Word Recording]] as a result. Rollins was named 1994's "Man of the Year" by the American men's magazine ''[[Details (magazine)|Details]]'' and became a contributing columnist to the magazine. With the increased exposure, Rollins made several appearances on American music channels MTV and [[VH1]] around this time, and made his Hollywood film debut in 1994 in ''[[The Chase (1994 film)|The Chase]]'' playing a police officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800022646/bio |title=Henry Rollins Biography |accessdate=2007-09-14 |publisher=Yahoo! Movies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, the Rollins Band's record label, Imago Records, declared itself bankrupt. Rollins began focusing on his spoken word career. He released ''Everything'', a recording of a chapter of his book ''[[Eye Scream]]'' with free jazz backing, in 1996. He continued to appear in various films, including ''[[Heat (1995 film)|Heat]]'', ''[[Johnny Mnemonic (film)|Johnny Mnemonic]]'' and ''[[Lost Highway (film)|Lost Highway]]''. The Rollins Band signed to [[Dreamworks Records]] in 1997 and soon released ''[[Come in and Burn]]'', but it did not receive as much critical acclaim as their previous material. Rollins continued to release spoken-word book readings, releasing ''[[Black Coffee Blues]]'' in the same year. In 1998, Rollins released ''[[Think Tank (Rollins)|Think Tank]]'', his first set of non-book-related spoken material in five years.

By 1998, Rollins felt that the relationship with his backing band had run its course, and the line-up disbanded. He had produced a Los Angeles [[hard rock]] band called [[Mother Superior (band)|Mother Superior]], and invited them to form a new incarnation of the Rollins Band. Their first album, ''[[Get Some Go Again]]'', was released two years later. The Rollins Band released several more albums, including 2001's ''[[Nice (Rollins Band album)|Nice]]'' and 2003's ''[[Rise Above: 24 Black Flag Songs to Benefit the West Memphis Three]]''. After 2003, the band became inactive as Rollins focused on radio and television work. During a 2006 appearance on ''[[Tom Green's House Tonight|Tom Green Live!]]'', Rollins stated that he "may never do music again",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=61600 |title=Henry Rollins on 'Tom Green Live' |date=November 5, 2006 |publisher=Blabbermouth.net |accessdate=2010-01-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606064937/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=61600 |archivedate=June 6, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a feeling which he reiterated in 2011 when talking to ''Trebuchet'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trebuchet-magazine.com/index.php/site/article/henry_rollins_Student_protests_are_great/|title=Henry Rollins:Student Protests are Great|date=January 11, 2011|publisher=Trebuchet Magazine|accessdate=2011-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with ''Culture Brats'', Rollins admitted he had sworn off music for good – "... and I must say that I miss it every day. I just don't know honestly what I could do with it that's different."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culturebrats.com/2011/03/tramp-last-mile-our-interview-with.html |title=Tramp The Last Mile: Our Interview With Henry Rollins |publisher=Culture Brats |date=2011-03-08 |accessdate=2012-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Rollins admitted a disdain for rehashing old music for the sake of it - "I don't want to play old music. To me, it is fighting battles that are already over and calling yourself a warrior. For me, I see no courage or adventure in doing the old thing over again. If others want to, that's for them. For myself, I have to move on. Life is too short to live in the past. There is a lot to be done."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commdiginews.com/entertainment/exclusive-interview-henry-rollins-speaks-about-punk-rock-19402/#BWirroYp4ESgox7S.99|title=EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW: Henry Rollins speaks about punk rock|author=Kevin Wells|publisher=Commdiginews.com|accessdate=January 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same topic, Rollins more recently said in 2016 "For me, music was a time and a place. I never really enjoyed being in a band. It was in me and it needed to come out, like a 25-year exorcism. One day, I woke up, and I didn't have any more lyrics. I just had nothing to contribute to the form, and I was done with band practice and traveling in groups." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Joe Goggins |url=http://www.theskinny.co.uk/music/interviews/the-last-word-henry-rollins |title=Henry Rollins on touring, spoken word &amp; nostalgia |publisher=The Skinny |date=2016-01-08 |accessdate=2017-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rollins is a guest star on [[Damian Cowell]]'s 2017 album ''Get Yer Dag On!''.

===Musical style===
As a vocalist, Rollins has adopted a number of styles through the years. He was noted in the [[Washington, D.C. hardcore]] scene for what journalist [[Michael Azerrad]] described as a "compelling, raspy howl."&lt;ref name="a26" /&gt; With State of Alert, Rollins "spat out the lyrics like a bellicose auctioneer."&lt;ref name="a27" /&gt; He adopted a similar style after joining Black Flag in 1981. By their album ''[[Damaged (Black Flag album)|Damaged]]'', however, Black Flag began to incorporate a [[Swung note|swing beat]] into their style. Rollins then abandoned his [[State of Alert]] "bark" and adopted the band's swing.&lt;ref name="a32"&gt;Azerrad, 2001. p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; Rollins later explained: "What I was doing kind of matched the vibe of the music. The music was intense and, well, I was as intense as you needed."&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad, 2001. p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

In both incarnations of the Rollins Band, Rollins combined spoken word with his traditional vocal style in songs such as "[[Liar (Rollins Band song)|Liar]]" (the song begins with a one-minute spoken diatribe by Rollins), barked his way through songs (such as "Tearing" and "Starve"), and employed the loud-quiet dynamic. ''Rolling Stone''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Anthony DeCurtis names Rollins a "screeching hate machine" and his "hallmark" as "the sheets-of-sound assault".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/rollinsband/albums/album/234867/review/5941451/get_some_go_again |title=Rollins Band: Get Some Go Again |accessdate=2007-09-20 |author=DeCurtis, Anthony |work=Rolling Stone |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012173915/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/rollinsband/albums/album/234867/review/5941451/get_some_go_again |archivedate=October 12, 2007 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the Rollins Band, his lyrics focused "almost exclusively on issues relating to personal integrity," according to critic Geoffrey Welchman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/rollinsband/albums/album/118204/review/5943481/weight |title=Rollins Band: Weight |accessdate=2007-09-20 |author=Welchman, Geoffrey |work=Rolling Stone |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012173910/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/rollinsband/albums/album/118204/review/5943481/weight |archivedate=October 12, 2007 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Lyrics etc. --&gt;

===As producer===
In the 1980s, Rollins produced an album of acoustic songs for the famed convict [[Charles Manson]] titled ''Completion''. The record was supposed to be released by [[SST Records]], but the project was canceled because the label received death threats for working with Manson. Only five test presses of ''Completion'' were pressed, two of which remain in Rollins' possession.
&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/dec/15/henry-rollins-charles-manson&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, Rollins produced Australian hard rock band the [[The Mark of Cain (band)|Mark of Cain]]'s third full-length album ''[[Ill at Ease (The Mark of Cain album)|Ill at Ease]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ill at Ease |website=The Mark of Cain |url=http://www.tmoc.com.au/js_albums/ill-at-ease/ |accessdate=12 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Joe Cole Murder, 1991==
Rollins and his best friend [[Murder of Joe Cole|Joe Cole]], son of actor [[Dennis Cole]], were involved in a shooting when they were assaulted by robbers in December 1991 outside their shared [[Venice, Los Angeles|Venice Beach, California]], home. Cole died after being shot in the face, but Rollins escaped.&lt;ref name=LAT&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-04-02/entertainment/ca-151_1_henry-rollins |title=Singer-Poet Henry Rollins Fuels His Art With Rage - Los Angeles Times |publisher=Articles.latimes.com |date=1999-01-12 |accessdate=2014-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The murder remains unsolved.

In an April 1992 ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' interview, Rollins revealed he kept a plastic container full of soil soaked with the blood of Cole. Rollins said "I dug up all the earth where his head fell—he was shot in the face—and I've got all the dirt here, and so Cole's in the house. I say good morning to him every day. I got his phone, too, so I got a direct line to him. So that feels good."&lt;ref name=LAT/&gt;

In a 2001 interview with Howard Stern, Rollins was asked about rumors that he had Cole's brain in his house. Rollins stated that he only has the soil from the spot Cole was killed. During the interview, Rollins also speculated that the reason they were targeted may have been because, days prior to the incident, record producer [[Rick Rubin]] – a fan of Rollins Band – had requested to hear the then newly recorded album ''[[The End of Silence]]'' and parked his Rolls-Royce outside their Venice Beach house while carrying a cell phone. Because of the notoriety of the neighborhood, Rollins suspected that this would bring trouble because of the implication that there was money in the home. He even wrote in his journal the night of Rubin's visit: "My place is going to get popped."&lt;ref&gt;[https://youtube.com/nmceYEk7ou8?t=36m49s ]{{dead link|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-Kr3JbpXXc |title=YouTube |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date= |accessdate=2017-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rollins has included Cole's story in his spoken word performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[DVD Verdict]] |title=Henry Rollins: Live At Luna Park |first=Patrick |last=Bromley |date=May 6, 2004 |url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/rollinslunapark.php |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304232037/http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/rollinslunapark.php |archivedate=March 4, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spoken word===
{{BLP unsourced section|date=February 2018}}
Rollins also has toured all over the world doing spoken word performances and his shows frequently last for over three hours. His spoken word style encompasses stand up comedy, accounts of experiences he's had in the world of music and during his extensive travels around the globe, self-deprecating stories about his own shortcomings, introspective recollections from his own life (such as the death of his friend, Joe Cole), commentaries on society and playful, sometimes vulgar, anecdotes.

===Video games===
Rollins was a playable character in both ''[[Def Jam: Fight for NY]]'' and ''[[Def Jam Fight for NY: The Takeover]]''.  Rollins is also the voice of Mace Griffin in ''[[Mace Griffin: Bounty Hunter]]''.

==Campaigning and activism==
[[File:Henry Rollins in Iraq with USO tour.jpg|thumb|right|Rollins signing a guitar while on a [[United Service Organizations]] (USO) tour in [[Iraq]] in 2003]]
Rollins has become an outspoken human rights activist, most vocally for [[LGBT rights by country|gay rights]]. In high school, a classmate of Rollins' was bullied by classmates to the point of attempting suicide. Rollins has cited this as the main catalyst of his "anti-homophobia."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Big Think|title=Henry Rollins on Gay Marriage|date=2012-07-01|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kF7vNVmb2fo&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=5m11s|accessdate=2017-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rollins frequently speaks out on social justice on his spoken word tours and promotes equality, regardless of sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://instinctmagazine.com/celebrity-interviews/henry-rollins.html |title=Henry Rollins |accessdate=2007-08-14 |author=Rollins, Henry |publisher=InstinctMagazine.com |date=2007-06-01 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070610202932/http://instinctmagazine.com/celebrity-interviews/henry-rollins.html |archivedate = June 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the host of the WedRock [[benefit concert]], which raised money for a pro-gay-marriage organization.

During the [[2003 Iraq War]], he started touring with the [[United Service Organizations]] to entertain troops overseas while remaining against the war, leading him to once cause a stir at a base in [[Kyrgyzstan]] when he told the crowd: "Your commander would never lie to you. That's the vice president's job."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/iraq/2005-12-22-uso-cover_x.htm |title=USO cheers troops, but Iraq gigs tough to book |accessdate=2007-08-14 |author1=Kasindorf, Martin |author2=Komarow, Steven |date=2005-12-22 |quote=Rollins, 44, has made six USO tours.

He has also been active in the campaign to free the "[[West Memphis 3|West Memphis Three]]"—three young men who were believed by their supporters to have been wrongfully convicted of murder, and who have since been released from prison, but not exonerated. Rollins appears with [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]] frontman [[Chuck D]] on the [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]] song "Rise Above" on the benefit album ''[[Rise Above: 24 Black Flag Songs to Benefit the West Memphis Three]]'', the first time Rollins had performed Black Flag's material since 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r608078|pure_url=yes}} |title=Rise Above: 24 Black Flag Songs to Benefit the West Memphis Three |accessdate=2007-08-15 |author=Prato, Greg |publisher=Allmusic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Continuing his activism on behalf of US troops and veterans, Rollins joined ''[[Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America]]'' (IAVA) in 2008 to launch a public service advertisement campaign, CommunityofVeterans.org, which helps veterans coming home from war reintegrate into their communities. In April 2009, Rollins helped IAVA launch the second phase of the campaign which engages the friends and family of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans at SupportYourVet.org.

On December 3, 2009, Rollins wrote of his support for the victims of the [[Bhopal disaster]] in India, in an article for ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/online/daily/2009/12/twenty-five-years-after-the-disaster-bhopal-is-still-ill.html |title=Twenty-five Years After the Disaster, Bhopal Is Still Ill |publisher=Vanity Fair |date=2009-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; 25 years–to the day–after the [[methyl isocyanate]] gas leak from the [[Union Carbide Corporation]]'s pesticide factory exposed more than half a million local people to poisonous gas and resulted in the death of 17,000. He spent time in Bhopal with the people, to listen to their stories.
