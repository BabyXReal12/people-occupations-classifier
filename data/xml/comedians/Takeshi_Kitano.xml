{{Nihongo|'''Takeshi Kitano'''|北野 武|Kitano Takeshi|born 18 January 1947}} is a Japanese comedian, television personality, director, actor, author, and screenwriter. While he is known primarily as a comedian and TV host in his native Japan, abroad he is known almost entirely for his filmwork. With the exception of his works as a film director, he is known almost exclusively by the stage name {{nihongo|'''Beat Takeshi'''|ビートたけし|Bīto Takeshi}}.

Kitano rose to prominence in the 1970s as one half of the comedy duo ''Two Beat'', before going solo and becoming one of the three biggest comedians in the country. After several small acting roles, he made his directorial debut with 1989's ''[[Violent Cop (1989 film)|Violent Cop]]'' and garnered international acclaim for ''[[Sonatine (1993 film)|Sonatine]]'' (1993). But he was not accepted as a director in Japan until ''[[Hana-bi]]'' won the [[Golden Lion]] in 1997. In October 2017, Kitano's completed his ''Outrage'' crime trilogy with the release of ''[[Outrage Coda]]''.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tomita|first1=Hidetsugu|title=Finale from Outrage|publisher=GQ Japan |date=3 December 2016 | url=http://gqjapan.jp/culture/movie/20161203/finale-from-outrage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has received critical acclaim for his idiosyncratic cinematic work, winning numerous awards with Japanese film critic [[Nagaharu Yodogawa]] having once dubbed him "the true successor" to influential filmmaker [[Akira Kurosawa]].&lt;ref name=INDEPENDENT&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituaries-nagaharu-yodogawa-1186803.html|last=Kirkup|first=James|title=Obituaries: Nagaharu Yodogawa|work=The Independent|date=23 November 1998|accessdate=19 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of Kitano's films are dramas about [[yakuza]] gangsters or the police. Described by critics as using an acting style that is highly deadpan or a camera style that approaches near-stasis, Kitano often uses long takes where little appears to be happening, or editing that cuts immediately to the aftermath of an event. Many of his films express a bleak worldview, but are also filled with humor and affection for their characters.

==Life and career==
===Early life===
Takeshi Kitano was born in [[Adachi, Tokyo]], with two older brothers and an older sister. His father worked as a house painter,&lt;ref name="arthouse.ru"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arthouse.ru/person.asp?ID=51 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004215422/http://www.arthouse.ru/person.asp?ID=51 |archivedate=4 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }} {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Kitano revealing that he was also possibly a [[yakuza]], while his mother was a strict disciplinarian and educator who worked in a factory.&lt;ref name="hollywood interview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehollywoodinterview.blogspot.com/2008/11/beat-takeshi-hollywood-interview.html |title="Beat" Takeshi: The Hollywood Flashback Interview |publisher=thehollywoodinterview.blogspot.com |date=26 July 2008 |accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his working-class neighborhood, the children looked up to baseball players and yakuza, with many of his neighbors being the latter.&lt;ref name="hollywood interview"/&gt; Kitano entered [[Meiji University]] and studied engineering, before dropping out at age 19. He went to the [[Asakusa]] district in 1972 to become a comedian. While working as an elevator operator at the Asakusa France-za strip club, he became an apprentice of its comedian Senzaburo Fukami and eventually the theater's [[MC]].&lt;ref name="YakuzaMovieGuide"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Schilling |first1=Mark |authorlink=Mark Schilling |title=The Yakuza Movie Book : A Guide to Japanese Gangster Films |publisher=[[Stone Bridge Press]] |year=2003 |pages=73–76 |isbn=1-880656-76-0 |url=http://www.stonebridge.com/YAKUZA/yakuza.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017060352/http://stonebridge.com/YAKUZA/yakuza.html |archivedate=17 October 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/11/19/national/history/asakusas-resilience-rubs-off-on-france-za-theater-cradle-of-postwar-pop-culture/#.Vm2RO7_a789 |title=Asakusa's resilience rubs off on France-za theater, cradle of postwar pop culture |work=[[Japan Times]] |date=19 November 2015 |accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comedy career and success===
In the 1970s, he formed a comedy duo with his friend Nirō Kaneko (also called Kiyoshi Kaneko). They took on the stage names ''Beat Takeshi'' and ''Beat Kiyoshi''; together referring to themselves as {{nihongo|''[[:ja:ツービート|Two Beat]]''|ツービート|Tsū Bīto|sometimes romanized as "The Two Beats"}}. This sort of duo comedy, known as ''[[manzai]]'' in Japan, usually features a great deal of high-speed back-and-forth banter between the two performers. Kiyoshi played the [[Double act|straight man]] (''[[tsukkomi]]'') against Takeshi's [[double act|funny man]] (''[[Glossary of owarai terms#boke|boke]]''). In 1976, they performed on television for the first time and became a success, propelling their act onto the national stage. The reason for their popularity had much to do with Kitano's material, which was much more risqué than traditional ''manzai''. The targets of his jokes were often the socially vulnerable, including the elderly, the handicapped, the poor, children, women, the ugly and the stupid. Complaints to the broadcaster led to censorship of some of Kitano's jokes and the editing of offensive dialogue. Kitano confirmed in a video interview that he was forbidden to access the [[NHK]] studios for five years for having exposed his body during a show when it was totally forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;''Getting Any?'' DVD published by Cheyenne Films EDV1040, France, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Two Beat was one of the most successful acts of its kind during the late 1970s and early 1980s, Kitano decided to go solo and the duo was dissolved. Together with [[Sanma Akashiya]] and [[Tamori]], Kitano is said to be one of the "[[:ja:ビッグ3 (日本のお笑いタレント)|Big Three]]" television comedians (''[[owarai]]'' ''[[tarento]]'') of Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japantoday.com/category/entertainment/view/sanma-tamori-takeshi-to-co-host-ntv-comedy-specials |title=Sanma, Tamori, Takeshi to co-host NTV comedy specials |publisher=[[Japan Today]] |date=4 November 2008 |accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some autobiographical elements relating to his ''manzai'' career can be found in his 1996 film ''[[Kids Return]]''. Beat Kiyoshi has a bit part in Kitano's 1999 film ''[[Kikujiro]]'', as "Man at the bus stop." Kitano had also become a popular television host. ''[[Takeshi's Castle]]'' was a game show hosted by Kitano in the 1980s, featuring slapstick-style physical contests. It would be shown in the United States years later under the name [[Most Extreme Elimination Challenge]], where he was dubbed as "Vic Romano" in the American version.

Many of Kitano's routines involved him portraying a gangster or other harsh characters. Kitano said that after playing comedy clubs he would be invited to drink with yakuza, where he would learn stories about the big crime bosses.&lt;ref name="hollywood interview"/&gt; His first major film role in [[Nagisa Oshima]]'s ''[[Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence]]'' (where he starred opposite [[Tom Conti]], [[Ryuichi Sakamoto]] and [[David Bowie]]), featured him cast as a tough [[Prisoner-of-war camp|POW camp]] sergeant during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="arthouse.ru"/&gt; Kitano said that he was happy with his performance and snuck into a showing of the film to see how the audience would accept him as a serious actor instead of a comedian. He was devastated when the audience burst into laughter upon his appearing on screen, but vowed to stick to serious and dark characters in film.&lt;ref name="hollywood interview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AV Interview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/takeshi-kitano-13882 |title=Takeshi Kitano Interview |publisher=[[The A.V. Club]] |date=11 August 2004 |accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, Kitano worked on the [[Family Computer]] video game ''[[Takeshi no Chōsenjō]]'' (translated as ''[[Takeshi no Chōsenjō|Takeshi's Challenge]]''), as a consultant and partial designer. He was the first Japanese celebrity to actively contribute to the development of a video game and starred in several commercials promoting its release. Due to the title's difficulty and confusing gameplay mechanics, it was placed first in Famitsu magazine's ''[[kusoge]]'' (shit game) ranking, and is often referred to as one of the worst video games of all time. ''[[Takeshi no Chōsenjō]]'' and its development was later the subject of the first episode of ''[[GameCenter CX]]'', a gaming variety show hosted by Osaka comedian [[Shinya Arino]].

In 1988, he published a memoir, ''Asakusa Kid''.&lt;ref&gt;http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51hPQ9AJr5L.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; He has also published a number of novels and other books which have been translated into French. After several other acting roles, mostly comedic, in 1989 he was cast as the lead in ''[[Violent Cop (1989 film)|Violent Cop]]''. When director [[Kinji Fukasaku]] stepped down over scheduling conflicts with Kitano, due to Kitano's TV commitments, the distributor suggested the comedian direct it at his own pace.&lt;ref name="hollywood interview"/&gt; He also rewrote the script heavily, and this marked the beginning of Kitano's career as a filmmaker.

===1990–2000: Film recognition===
[[File:Takeshi Kitano Leone D'oro.jpg|thumb|Kitano accepting the [[Golden Lion]] Award in 1997 for his film ''Hana-bi''.]]
Kitano's second film as director and first as screenwriter was ''[[Boiling Point (1990 film)|Boiling Point]]'' (''3-4X10 October'') released in 1990.&lt;ref name="arthouse.ru"/&gt; [[Mark Schilling]] cited this as the film where Kitano defined his style with long takes, minimal camera movement, brief dialogue, sly humor, and sudden violence.&lt;ref name="YakuzaMovieGuide"/&gt;

Kitano's third film, ''[[A Scene at the Sea]]'', was released in 1991. It follows a deaf garbage collector who is determined to learn how to surf after discovering a broken surfboard. Kitano's more delicate, romantic side came to the fore here, along with his trademark deadpan approach. The film garnered numerous nominations and awards, including Best Film at the prestigious [[Blue Ribbon Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103704/awards|title=A Scene at the Sea (1991) – Awards|accessdate=5 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also started a long-running collaboration with composer [[Joe Hisaishi]], which would last until 2002.

Although 1993's ''[[Sonatine (1993 film)|Sonatine]]'' did poorly in Japan, it received rave reviews in Europe when it was shown at the [[1993 Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="YakuzaMovieGuide"/&gt; Kitano plays a Tokyo yakuza who is sent by his boss to Okinawa to help end a gang war there. He is tired of gangster life, and when he finds out the whole mission is a ruse, he welcomes what comes with open arms. All four of his films were screened at the 1994 [[London Film Festival]].

In August 1994, Kitano was involved in a motorscooter accident and suffered injuries that caused partial [[paralysis]] of the right-side of his face. As reported by Dan Edwards, Kitano later said that the accident was an "unconscious suicide attempt".&lt;ref&gt;Kitano quoted in Lee Server, Asian Pop Cinema, op. cit., p. 82 or see also [http://sensesofcinema.com/2000/10/hanabi/ Article in ''Senses of Cinema'']&lt;/ref&gt; Kitano made ''[[Kids Return]]'' in 1996, soon after his recovery.

The 1995 release of ''[[Getting Any?]]'' (''Minna Yatteruka!''), which was filmed before the accident, showed Kitano returning to his comedy roots. This ''[[Airplane!]]''-like assemblage of comedic scenes, all centering loosely around a [[Walter Mitty]]-type character trying to have sex in a car, met with little acclaim in Japan. Much of the film satirizes popular Japanese culture, such as ''[[Ultraman]]'' or ''[[Godzilla]]'' and even the [[Zatoichi]] character that Kitano himself would go on to play eight years later. That year Kitano also appeared in the film adaptation of [[William Gibson]]'s 1995 ''[[Johnny Mnemonic (film)|Johnny Mnemonic]]'', credited by the mononym "Takeshi",&lt;ref name=JM&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113481/|title=Johnny Mnemonic (1995)|accessdate=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; although his on-screen time was greatly reduced for the American cut of the film.

After his motorscooter accident, Kitano took up painting. His paintings have been published in books, featured in gallery exhibitions, and adorn the covers of many of the soundtrack albums for his films. His paintings were featured prominently in his most critically acclaimed film, 1997's ''[[Hana-bi]]''. Although for years already Kitano's largest audience had been the foreign arthouse crowd, ''Hana-bi'' cemented his status internationally as one of Japan's foremost modern filmmakers. Although it was not a big success financially,&lt;ref name="Midnight Interview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.midnighteye.com/interviews/takeshi-kitano/ |title=Midnight Eye interview: Takeshi Kitano |publisher=midnighteye.com |date=5 November 2003 |accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; it won the [[Golden Lion]] award at the [[54th Venice International Film Festival|1997 Venice Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="YakuzaMovieGuide"/&gt; Kitano himself said it was not until he won this award that he was accepted as a serious director in Japan; prior his films were looked at as just the hobby of a famous comedian.&lt;ref name="AV Interview"/&gt;

Among his most significant acting roles were Nagisa Oshima's 1999 film ''[[Taboo (1999 film)|Taboo]]'', where he played Captain [[Hijikata Toshizo]] of the [[Shinsengumi]]. ''[[Kikujiro]]'', released in 1999 and named after his father, was a semi-comedy featuring Kitano as a ne'er-do-well crook who winds up paired up with a young boy looking for his mother, and goes on a series of misadventures with him.

He hosted ''[[Koko ga Hen da yo Nihonjin]]'' (English translation, ''This doesn't make sense, Japanese people!'') which was a Japanese TV show that was broadcast weekly from 1998 to 2002, a talk show where a large panel of Japanese-speaking foreigners from around the world debate current issues in Japanese society. He currently hosts ''[[Unbelievable (TV series)|Unbelievable]]'', which was relaunched in 2001, and the weekly television program ''Beat Takeshi's TV Tackle''. ''TV Tackle'' is a kind of panel discussion among entertainers and politicians regarding controversial current events. Another of his shows is ''Sekai Marumie TV'' ("The World Exposed"), a weekly collection of various interesting video clips from around the world, often focusing on the weird aspects of other countries. On this show, he plays a childlike idiot, insulting the guests, and usually appearing wearing strange costumes during the show.

===2000–present===
Kitano played [[Kitano (Battle Royale)|a similarly named character]] in the 2000 controversial Japanese blockbuster ''[[Battle Royale (film)|Battle Royale]]'', which takes place in a future where a group of teenagers are randomly selected each year to eliminate each other on a deserted island.

His 2000 film ''[[Brother (2000 film)|Brother]]'' was deliberately intended to be a hit abroad. Shot in Los Angeles, it starred Kitano as a deposed and exiled Tokyo yakuza setting up a drug empire in Los Angeles with the aid of a local gangster played by [[Omar Epps]]. However, the film met with tepid international response. Although in Japan it did better financially than ''Hana-bi''.&lt;ref name="Midnight Interview"/&gt; ''[[Dolls (2002 film)|Dolls]]'' in 2002 had Kitano directing but not starring in a romantic drama with three different stories about undying love, and was loosely based on a [[bunraku]] play.&lt;ref name="YakuzaMovieGuide"/&gt;

Following the disappointing response to the film ''Brother'' and the film ''Dolls'', Kitano received a sequence of unsympathetic reviews from the press in the United States. Criticism was less severe in Europe and Asia though many commentators were not as lavish with their praise as they had been with his previous films. 2003's ''[[Zatōichi (2003 film)|Zatōichi]]'', in which Kitano directed and starred, silenced many of these dissenters. With a new take on the character from [[Shintaro Katsu]]'s [[Zatoichi|long-running film and TV series]], ''Zatōichi'' was Kitano's biggest box office success in Japan,&lt;ref name="Midnight Interview"/&gt; did quite well in limited release across the world, and won countless awards at home and abroad, including the [[Silver Lion]] award at the Venice Film Festival. Kitano revealed that he was approached by others to create the film and therefore differed from his own techniques and followed the common filmmaking process in order to please them and make a pure-entertainment film.&lt;ref name="AV Interview"/&gt;

From April 2005 to 2008, Kitano was an instructor at the Graduate School of Visual Arts, [[Tokyo University of the Arts]].

Kitano's film, ''[[Takeshis']]'' was released in Japan in November 2005, as the first installment in his surrealist autobiographical series. This was followed in 2007, by his second surrealist autobiographical film ''[[Glory to the Filmmaker!]]'' (appearing as Beat Takeshi), and a third in 2008, titled ''[[Achilles and the Tortoise (film)|Achilles and the Tortoise]]''. In between these films, Kitano appeared in a number of other television projects and smaller projects. In 2007 he appeared in ''Dots and Lines'' (a TV mini-series) as Jūtarō Torikai. Also in 2007, Kitano appeared in ''To Each His Own Cinema'' as the projectionist (in the segment "Rencontre unique") as Beat Takeshi, and in the TV movie ''Wada Akiko Satsujin Jiken''. In 2008, he did the voice-over in ''The Monster X Strikes Back: Attack the G8 Summit'', for Take-Majin, a heroic monster based on Kitano.

In 2010, the [[Fondation Cartier pour l'art contemporain]] in Paris held a one-man show displaying his paintings and installations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.creativereview.co.uk/cr-blog/2010/march/beat-takeshi-kitano-at-fondation-cartier|title=Creative Review – Beat Takeshi Kitano at Fondation Cartier|publisher=[[Creative Review]]|first=Eliza|last=Williams|date=17 March 2010|accessdate=24 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429045100/http://www.creativereview.co.uk/cr-blog/2010/march/beat-takeshi-kitano-at-fondation-cartier|archivedate=29 April 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A room in the basement played a 12-hour loop of his work as a TV host.

Kitano's 2010 film ''[[Outrage (2010 film)|Outrage]]'' was screened at the [[2010 Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/may/17/cannes-film-festival-reviews|title=Cannes film festival: Countdown to Zero, The Housemaid, A Screaming Man and Outrage|work=The Guardian|first=Peter|last=Bradshaw|date=17 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He admitted he tried something different for ''Outrage'' by adding a lot of dialogue, stepping back as the main character to make an ensemble piece, and having the feel of a nature documentary watching the characters kill each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electricsheepmagazine.co.uk/features/2011/12/06/outrage-interview-with-takeshi-kitano/ |title=Outrage: Interview with Takeshi Kitano |publisher=Electric Sheep Magazine |date=6 December 2011 |accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A sequel, 2012's ''[[Outrage Beyond]]'', was screened in competition at the [[69th Venice International Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117948168/|title=Outrage Beyond |work=Variety|first=Justin|last=Chang|date=2 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also appeared in Yasuo Furuhata's 2012 film, ''[[Anata e|Dearest]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117948342/|title=Dearest |work=Variety|first=Ronnie|last=Sheib|date=17 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2012, Takeshi Kitano said that the producers wanted him to make a third ''Outrage'' film depending on the box office.&lt;ref name=ScreenDaily&gt;{{cite web|last=Macnab|first=Geoffrey|title=Takeshi Kitano considers making a third Outrage movie|url=http://www.screendaily.com/takeshi-kitano-considers-making-a-third-outrage-movie/5046143.article|work=Screen Daily|accessdate=1 July 2013|date=5 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 March 2013, ''Minkei News'' of Hong Kong reported that Kitano won the Best Director award for ''Outrage Beyond'' at the 7th [[Asian Film Awards]] in Hong Kong.

On 10 August 2013, in an interview reported by John Bleasdale, Kitano revealed his current plans for a sequel to ''Outrage Beyond'' and an untitled personal film project.&lt;ref&gt;Bleasdale, John (2013). "Yakuza Games," Cinespect, 10 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; As Kitano stated, "Ideally what would happen would be this: ''Outrage Beyond'' becomes a huge hit, so huge that my producer allows me to make one film I really want to do and then come back to the sequel after I've made the film I really want to do."{{fact|date=May 2015}}

In September 2015, it was announced that Kitano would be contributing his voice and likeness in the upcoming [[Ryū ga Gotoku 6|sixth entry]] of [[SEGA]]'s ''[[Yakuza (series)|Yakuza]]'' action video game series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Martin|first1=Michael|title=First Look at PS4 Exclusive Yakuza 6|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/28/first-look-at-ps4-exclusive-yakuza-6|website=IGN|accessdate=26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This collaboration marked Kitano's first involvement with the video game industry in 30 years since the 1986 release of ''[[Takeshi no Chōsenjō]]''.

Takeshi co-starred in the live action adaptation of the manga ''[[Ghost in the Shell (2017 film)|Ghost in the Shell]]'', marking his return to American cinema nearly twenty years after ''[[Johnny Mnemonic (film)|Johnny Mnemonic]]'' in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/asia/beat-takeshi-in-ghost-in-the-shell-1201721660/ |title=Beat Takeshi to Star in Scarlett Johansson's "Ghost in the Shell" |work=Variety |date=3 March 2016 |accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he has expressed his dislike of anime and manga in the past, he accepted the role because "even though this stylish piece of entertainment is totally different from the films I've directed, I thought it was interesting that [[List of Ghost in the Shell characters|Aramaki]], the role I play, is a character who gives off a peculiar vibe and, in various episodes, is set at the core of the characters' relationships. I'm looking forward to see how the movie turns out."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/hollywood-ghost-in-the-shell-movie-finally-gets-a-japan-1762583224 |title=Hollywood Ghost in the Shell Movie Finally Gets a Japanese Actor: Beat Takeshi |publisher=Kotaku |date=3 March 2016 |accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Kitano released the third and final installment in the successful ''[[Outrage (2010 film)|Outrage]]'' series titled ''[[Outrage Coda]]''.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Awards==
Kitano won the [[Golden Lion]] award at the [[54th Venice International Film Festival]] in 1997 for his film [[Hana-bi]].
