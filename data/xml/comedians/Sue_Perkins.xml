In April 2015, Perkins was the victim of cyberbullying on Twitter after bookmakers made her the favourite to fill the vacancy on the BBC's ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]'' programme left by the departure of [[Jeremy Clarkson]], despite Perkins saying that rumours about her imminent appointment to the show were "fabricated".&lt;ref name="The Observer 19 April 2015"/&gt; She temporarily quit the social media site, but returned in August 2015.

In September 2015, Perkins revealed that she was diagnosed with [[prolactinoma]], which is a benign growth on her [[pituitary gland]]. Perkins received the diagnosis eight years previously.
