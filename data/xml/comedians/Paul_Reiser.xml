'''Paul Reiser''' (born March 30, 1956&lt;ref name="youtube"&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview Paul Reiser|accessdate=2018-03-30|ref=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AueMo4XVkAc}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Paul Reiser Then and Now"&gt;{{cite web|title=Paul Reiser Then and Now|url=http://stantondaily.com/paul-reiser-then-now/|website=Stanton Daily|accessdate=2018-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is an [[Americans|American]] comedian, actor, writer, and musician. He is best known for his roles as  Michael Taylor in the 1980s sitcom ''[[My Two Dads]]'', Paul Buchman in the 1990s TV sitcom ''[[Mad About You]]'', Carter Burke in the 1986 film ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'', and more recently as Doug Getty in the Amazon TV series ''[[Red Oaks]]''.

Reiser is ranked 77th on [[Comedy Central]]'s 2004 list of the "100 Greatest Stand-ups of All Time".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thegrablegroup.com/speaker/paul-reiser-100-greatest-stand-ups-time/ |title=Paul Reiser &amp;#124; 100 Greatest Stand-ups of All Time |publisher=Thegrablegroup.com |date= |accessdate=2015-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name of Reiser's [[production company]], Nuance Productions, is inspired by one of his lines in the film ''[[Diner (film)|Diner]]'' (1982), in which his character explains his discomfort with the word "nuance".

Reiser currently stars in the [[Netflix]] supernatural-horror series ''[[Stranger Things]]'', as Dr. Sam Owens.

==Early life==
Reiser was born in [[New York City]] in 1956, the son of Helen (born 1919), a homemaker, and Sam Reiser, a wholesale health food distributor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/20/Paul-Reiser.html |title=Paul Reiser Biography (1957–) |publisher=Filmreference.com |accessdate=June 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His family is of [[Romanian-Jewish]] descent; he has three sisters. Reiser attended the [[East Side Hebrew Institute]] and graduated from [[Stuyvesant High School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9506E7D71230F936A3575AC0A961958260 |title=Be It Ever So Urban, It's Green |first=Rick |last=Lyman |date=September 5, 1997 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=November 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He earned his [[bachelor's degree]] at [[Binghamton University]], where he majored in music (piano, composition).

During his university years, Reiser was active in student theater productions at the Hinman Little Theater, an on-campus [[community theater]] organization located in Hinman College, Reiser's dorm community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.binghamton.edu/magazine/index.php/magazine/cover-story/comic-relief/11 |title=Binghamton University - Magazine: Comic relief |publisher=Binghamton.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later renamed the Hinman Production Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geocities.com/hinman_production_company |title=26, 2009+00:01:09 |publisher=Webcitation.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5knuO2Dx7?url=http://www.geocities.com/hinman_production_company |archivedate=October 26, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He found his calling as a comedian while performing in New York clubs during university summer breaks.

==Career==

After developing his skills as a stand-up comedian, Reiser had a breakout film role in 1982 when he appeared in ''[[Diner (film)|Diner]]'', a [[Coming of age|coming-of-age]] film directed by [[Barry Levinson]]. Reiser's character, Modell, a closet stand-up comedian, effectively brought Reiser's abilities to the attention of [[Hollywood]]. He followed this success by playing a detective in ''[[Beverly Hills Cop]]'' (1984), a role he reprised in its sequel, ''[[Beverly Hills Cop II]]'' (1987). Reiser also had roles in [[James Cameron]]'s ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'' (1986), in which he played the corrupt Carter Burke; ''[[The Marrying Man]]'' (1991) and ''[[Bye Bye Love (film)|Bye Bye Love]]'' (1995).

Reiser starred as one of two possible fathers of a teenage girl in the TV sitcom ''[[My Two Dads]]'' (1987&amp;ndash;90), and later came to prominence in North America as Paul Buchman in ''[[Mad About You]]'' (1992&amp;ndash;99), a comedy series he co-created, in which [[Helen Hunt]] co-starred as his on-screen wife. He was also the co-composer of the show's theme song, "The Final Frontier" (with [[Don Was]]), and performed the piano for the theme's recording.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=22952 |title=Final Frontier by Andrew Gold Songfacts |publisher=Songfacts.com |date= |accessdate=2015-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reiser's role in ''Mad About You'' earned him nominations for an [[Emmy]], a [[Golden Globe]], an [[American Comedy Award]] and a [[Screen Actors Guild Award]]. For the show's final season, Reiser and Hunt received $1&amp;nbsp;million (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1|1999|r=1}}}} million today) per episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9802E7D81338F937A15750C0A96E958260 |title=THE MEDIA BUSINESS; NBC Signs Deal to Keep 'Mad About You' for Another Season |first=Bill |last=Carter |date=March 24, 1998 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=March 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Reiser played a dramatic role as a man desperate to locate his biological mother, after learning he has a serious illness, in the British TV film ''[[My Beautiful Son]]''. In 2002, Reiser made a guest appearance as himself on [[Larry David]]'s [[HBO]] sitcom, ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0551424/|title=Curb Your Enthusiasm: Season 3, Episode 5 : The Terrorist Attack|publisher=IMDb.com|accessdate=2015-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the TV comedy film ''Atlanta'' (2007), Reiser appears as one half of a couple who, after meeting at a funeral, are unable to stay away from each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/zap-prinzeatlantapilotcasting,0,4209768.story | work=Chicagotribune.com | title=Prinze Braves ''Atlanta'' for CBS|accessdate=2015-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Reiser collaborated with the singer [[Julia Fordham]] to create a CD album titled ''Unusual Suspects'', which includes the song "UnSung Hero", dedicated to American soldiers serving in [[Afghanistan]]. The two embarked on an acoustic tour after its release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Friedman |first=Roger |url=http://showbiz411.com/2010/09/20/paul-reiser-musician-tv-comic-joins-famed-singer-in-song-for-soldiers |title=Paul Reiser, Musician: TV Comic Joins Famed Singer in Song for Soldiers |publisher=Showbiz411.com |date=September 20, 2010|accessdate=2015-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reiser also co-wrote the song, "No There There" with [[Melissa Manchester]] for her 2015 album, ''[[You Gotta Love the Life]]''.&lt;ref name="Be My Baby 50th"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shapiro|first1=Gregg|title=Melissa Manchester Loving the life: an interview with Melissa Manchester

I went to a concert and it turned out that he had co-written several of the lovely songs that the artist was doing. He was there and I asked him if he would like to write (with me) and he said, "Sure." I went to his home and we knocked it out.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Early in his career, Reiser was the opening act for Manchester, she warned him that music audiences can be rough on comedians and that the last comedian that opened for her, left the stage in tears. Reiser reflects about this warning and on how he then bombed at the [[Concord Resort Hotel|Concord Hotel]]. The story is detailed the chapter, "Don't Worry if They Suck", by Paul Reiser, in ''I Killed: True Stories of the Road from America's Top Comics'' (2010), By Ritch Shydner, Mark Schiff.&lt;ref name="Manchester story"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ritch Shydner|author2=Mark Schiff|title=I Killed: True Stories of the Road from America's Top Comics|date=21 January 2009|publisher=Crown/Archetype|isbn=9780307496041|page=98|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gLrXMmu9mRUC&amp;pg=PA96|accessdate=25 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reiser scripted and starred in the semi-autobiographical comedy series ''[[The Paul Reiser Show]]'', which aired on [[NBC]] as a [[mid-season replacement]] during the 2010–11 TV season.&lt;ref name=schedule&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2010/05/16/nbc-unveils-2010-2011-primetime-schedule/20100516nbc01/|title=NBC Unveils 2010–11 Primetime Schedule Accented by Five New Comedies, Seven New Dramas and New Alternative Program |date=May 16, 2010 |work=The Futon Critic |accessdate=May 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; "This is nice", commented Reiser on the [[Stephanie Miller]] radio program, "because you get to sit around and root for other shows to fail." However, due to the lack of [[lead time]] and [[Promo (media)|promotion]] by NBC prior to its debut (as well as [[Broadcast programming|poor scheduling]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://screenrant.com/paul-reiser-jay-leno-tonight-show-yman-112521/ |title=Paul Reiser Speaks Out About NBC on ‘The Tonight Show’ |publisher=Screenrant.com |date= |accessdate=2015-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-04-27/entertainment/ct-live-0428-amy-landecker-20110427_1_reiser-amy-landecker-john-records-landecker |title=Amy Landecker moves on after Paul Reiser Show |publisher=Articles.chicagotribune.com |date=2011-04-27 |accessdate=2015-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; the low-rated show was canceled on April 22, 2011, with only two episodes aired.&lt;ref name=cancel&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2011/04/22/nbc-cancels-the-paul-reiser-show/90330|title=NBC Cancels ''The Paul Reiser'' Show|last=Seidman|first=Robert|date=April 22, 2011|work=The Futon Critic|accessdate=April 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Seidman |first=Robert |url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2011/04/22/nbc-cancels-the-paul-reiser-show/90330 |title=''The Paul Reiser Show'' Cancelled After Two Episodes – Ratings &amp;#124; TVbytheNumbers |publisher=Tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com |date=April 22, 2011 |accessdate=June 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvseriesfinale.com/tv-show/the-paul-reiser-show-cancelled-19668/ |title=''Paul Reiser Show'' canceled |publisher=TV Series Finale |accessdate=June 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He co-created (but did not star in) the 2017 dramedy ''[[There's... Johnny!]]'', set backstage at ''[[The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson]]'' in 1972. Originally created for [[Seeso]], the seven-episode season was released on [[Hulu]] after Seeso's collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/johnny-review-1058927 |date=16 November 2017 |author1=Tim Goodman |title='There's ... Johnny!': TV Review |accessdate=4 April 2018|publisher=''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reiser has written three books: ''Couplehood'', about the ups and downs of being in a committed relationship; [[Babyhood (Paul Reiser book)|''Babyhood'']], about his experiences as a first-time father; and ''Familyhood'' (released in May 2011), a collection of humorous essays. ''Couplehood'' is unique in that it starts on page 145; Reiser explained this as his method of giving the reader a false sense of accomplishment. In 1996, Reiser appeared on ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' in the middle of writing ''Babyhood''. Since he had not yet decided on a title, he presented a prop book, titled simply "Book" and with the same cover as that of ''Couplehood''.

==Personal life==
Reiser married Paula Ravets on August 21, 1988. They have two sons: Ezra Samuel (born 1995) and Leon (born 2000). He is the cousin of screenwriter and producer [[Will Reiser]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4jm24n/i_am_paul_reiser_actor_comedian_author_and/|title=I am Paul Reiser - Actor, Comedian, Author, and Musician. Ask Me Anything! • /r/IAmA|work=reddit.com|accessdate=October 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; who is known for writing the semi-autobiographical comedy-drama film ''[[50/50 (2011 film)|50/50]]'' (2011).

Reiser's first cousin is the legal scholar [[Richard Epstein]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ricochet.com/main-feed/The-Chicken-or-The-Egg |title=The Chicken or The Egg? |publisher=Ricochet.com |date=2014-02-13 |accessdate=2015-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
