'''Jennifer Ann McCarthy''' (born November 1, 1972),&lt;ref name="wkp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wekinglypigs.com/cgi-bin/nand/search/pmstat?browse=%3A%3ACONFIG%3A%3Adatebrowse&amp;key=1993&amp;limit=0|title=Playmate listing|accessdate=March 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EOnline"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.eonline.com/celebrities/profile/index.jsp?uuid=f1be2dea-9225-4813-a53c-2e14660ffbd3 |title=Jenny McCarthy Profile|work= [[E!]] Online|accessdate= 2007-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; credited as '''Jenny McCarthy''' and '''Jenny Wahlberg''',&lt;ref name=Wahlberg/&gt; is an American anti-vaccine activist, actress, model, television host, author, and screenwriter. She began her career in 1993 as a [[Glamour photography|nude model]] for ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine and was later named their [[Playmate of the Year]]. McCarthy then parlayed her ''Playboy'' fame into a television and film acting career starting as a co-host on the MTV game show ''[[Singled Out]]'', then some eponymous sitcoms, as well as films such as ''[[BASEketball]]'', ''[[Diamonds (1999 film)|Diamonds]]'', ''[[Scream 3]]'', and ''[[Santa Baby (film)|Santa Baby]]''. She is a former co-host of the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] talk show ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]''.

McCarthy has written books about [[parenting]] and has become an activist promoting research into environmental causes and [[alternative medicine|alternative medical]] treatments for [[autism]]. She has promoted the idea that [[vaccines cause autism]]&lt;ref name="Fallik"&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Neurol Today |year=2008 |volume=8 |issue=11 |pages=1, 8 |title= After vaccine–autism case settlement, MDs urged to continue recommending vaccines |author= Fallik D |url=http://www.neurotodayonline.com/pt/re/neurotoday/fulltext.00132985-200806050-00001.htm |doi= 10.1097/01.NT.0000324682.98661.5c}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that [[Chelation therapy#Autism|chelation therapy]] helped cure her son of autism.&lt;ref name=Rochman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Greenfeld/&gt; Both claims are unsupported by medical consensus, and her son's autism diagnosis has been questioned.&lt;ref name=Greenfeld/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rubin/&gt; McCarthy has been described as "the nation's most prominent purveyor of anti-vaxxer ideology",&lt;ref name=Grove/&gt; but she has denied the charge, stating: "I am not anti-vaccine".&lt;ref name=Grove/&gt;

== Early life ==
Jennifer Ann McCarthy was born on November 1, 1972 at Little Company of Mary Hospital located in the southwest Chicago suburb of [[Evergreen Park, Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cookcountyclerk.com/sweethomecookcounty/documents/2007sweethome.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-10-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160528132937/http://www.cookcountyclerk.com/sweethomecookcounty/documents/2007sweethome.pdf |archivedate=May 28, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was born to a working-class Catholic family, and has Irish, German, and Polish ancestry.&lt;ref name=Sweeney&gt;{{cite news|author=Sweeney, Meghan|url= http://www.irishcentral.com/ent/And-now-for-the-Worst-Performance-by-an-Irish-American-2780.html |title=Irish-American actors (dis)honored with a Razzie]|work= IrishCentral''|date= March 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2010/09/28/jenny_mccarthys_genitals_compared_to_r |title=Jenny McCarthy's Genitals Compared To 'Roadkill' – Starpulse.com |publisher=www.starpulse.com |accessdate=October 7, 2010|date= September 28, 2010|quote= I see them talk to the make-up artist and the make-up artist comes walking over and she goes, 'They said they'd never saw anyone as hairy as you their entire life.'

In 1993 ''Playboy'' magazine offered McCarthy $20,000 to pose for its October issue. McCarthy became the Playmate of the Month for October 1993. ''Playboy'' publisher [[Hugh Hefner]] cites McCarthy's "wholesome Catholic girl" persona as the unique quality for which she was selected out of 10,000 applicants.&lt;ref name=BiographyChannel&gt;"Jenny McCarthy" ''[[Biography (TV series)|Biography]]''. [[The Biography Channel]]. December 24, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTimes&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/specials/magazine4/articles/mccarthy.html "Heroine Worship: The McCarthy Era"]. ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' &lt;!--Author and date needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Her layout emphasized her Catholic upbringing with a schoolgirl theme. According to McCarthy, the pictorial caused an uproar in her Catholic neighborhood, and resulted in her house being pelted with eggs, her sisters being taunted at school, and McCarthy, who counted Catholic nuns among her aunts, being lectured about her future [[damnation]] by those close to her.&lt;ref name=BiographyChannel/&gt; McCarthy was later made the Playmate of the Year, and was paid a $100,000 salary.&lt;ref name=BiographyChannel/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTimes/&gt; In 1994, because of her newfound public attention, McCarthy moved to Los Angeles and, for a time, hosted ''Hot Rocks'', a [[Playboy TV]] show featuring uncensored [[music video]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://abc7.com/archive/8665847/|title=Jenny McCarthy to pose for Playboy again|work=ABC7 Los Angeles|access-date=2018-01-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, when [[MTV]] chose McCarthy to cohost a new dating show called ''[[Singled Out]]'', she left ''Hot Rocks''. Her job as a host was a success, and ''Playboy'' wanted her to do more modeling. That same year she also appeared at [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF) pay-per-view event [[WrestleMania XI]] as a guest valet for villain [[Shawn Michaels]], who faced heroic [[WWE Championship|WWF Champion]], [[Kevin Nash|Diesel]]. She left after the match with the victor, Diesel. McCarthy returned to World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE, formerly the WWF) on the [[Saturday Night's Main Event results#Saturday Night's Main Event XXXVI|edition of August 2, 2008,]] of ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event]]'' to thank the fans for supporting [[Generation Rescue]], an [[autism]] advocacy organization. In 1996 she landed a small part in the comedy ''[[The Stupids (film)|The Stupids]]''. In 1997 McCarthy launched two shows. The first one was an MTV sketch comedy show ''[[The Jenny McCarthy Show (1997)|The Jenny McCarthy Show]]'', which was sufficiently popular for [[NBC]] to sign her for an eponymous sitcom later that year, ''[[Jenny (TV series)|Jenny]]''. Also in 1997 she appeared on one of two covers for the September issue of ''Playboy'' (the other cover featured [[Pamela Anderson]]). McCarthy also released an autobiography: ''Jen-X: Jenny McCarthy's Open Book''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0060392339|title=Jen-X: Jenny McCarthy's Open Book|accessdate=2010-05-06|publisher=[[Amazon.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 McCarthy's first major movie role was alongside [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]] in the comedy ''[[BASEketball]]''. The following year, she starred in ''[[Diamonds (1999 film)|Diamonds]]''. In 2000 she had a role in the horror movie ''[[Scream 3]]'', and three years later she [[parodied]] that role in horror film [[Parody|spoof]] ''[[Scary Movie 3]]'' along with fellow Playmate and actress [[Pamela Anderson]]. In 2005, McCarthy produced, wrote, and starred in the movie ''[[Dirty Love (film)|Dirty Love]]'', which was directed by her husband at the time, [[John Asher]]. In March 2006 she was given [[26th Golden Raspberry Awards|Razzie Awards]] for "Worst Actress", "Worst Screenplay", and "Worst Picture" for her work on ''Dirty Love'', which also earned Asher a Razzie for "Worst Director."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=26th Annual Golden Raspberry (Razzie©) Award 'Winners'|url=http://www.razzies.com/history/05winners.asp|author=John Wilson and The Golden Raspberry Award Foundation|year=2006|access-date=August 4, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705030031/http://www.razzies.com/history/05winners.asp|archive-date=July 5, 2008|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to her early TV fame on MTV and her short-lived, self-titled NBC sitcom, McCarthy has guest-starred in a variety of other television shows, including ''[[Stacked]]'', ''[[Charmed]]'', ''[[The Drew Carey Show]]'', ''[[Wings (NBC TV series)|Wings]]'', ''[[Fastlane (TV series)|Fastlane]]'', ''[[Two and a Half Men]]'' and ''[[Just Shoot Me!]]''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} She was the voice of Six in the third season of Canadian computer-animated science fiction cartoon ''[[Tripping the Rift]]''. In 2005 McCarthy hosted a show on [[E!]] called ''Party at the Palms''. The [[reality television|reality show]], which was filmed at [[Palms Casino Resort|The Palms]] Hotel in [[Las Vegas]], featured hotel guests, party goers, and celebrities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2005/Jun-06-Mon-2005/living/1997484.html|title=Las Vegas Review-Journal|author=|date=|website=Las Vegas Review-Journal|accessdate=May 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McCarthy has continued her work with ''Playboy'' over the years, both as a model and in other capacities. She appeared on the cover of the magazine's January 2005 issue wearing a leopard skin version of the company's iconic [[Playboy bunny|"bunny suit"]] and was featured in a pictorial shot at [[Elvis Presley]]'s [[Graceland]] mansion in that same issue. She was the second woman (following [[Carmen Electra]]) and first former Playmate to become a celebrity photographer for the Playboy Cyber Club, where she photographed model Jennifer Madden.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Her younger sister, Amy McCarthy, also has posed for ''Playboy''. She was Cyber Girl of the Week for September 27, 2004, and Cyber Girl of the Month for January 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.playboy.com/girls/cybergirls/month/200501/|accessdate=2007-09-18|title=Amy McCarthy|publisher=Playboy.com|date=January 2005|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011030807/http://www.playboy.com/girls/cybergirls/month/200501/|archivedate=October 11, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 McCarthy starred in a five-episode online series, called ''[[In the Motherhood]]'', along with [[Chelsea Handler]] and [[Leah Remini]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inthemotherhood.com/ |title=ABC.com – Television Shows &amp; Programming |publisher=Inthemotherhood.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show aired on [[MSN]] and was based on being a mother where users could submit their stories to have it made into real webisodes.

She has also appeared in two video games: playing the role of Agent Tanya in the video game ''[[Command and Conquer: Red Alert 3]]'', replacing [[Kari Wührer]], and the fitness video game ''Your Shape Featuring Jenny McCarthy''.&lt;ref name="playboydec"&gt;{{cite journal|periodical=Playboy|publisher=Playboy Inc.|title=Playmate News|volume=56|date=December 2009|pages=166–167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 31, 2010, McCarthy was a correspondent in [[Times Square]] for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.parade.com/celebrity/celebrity-parade/2010/1221-jenny-mccarthy-new-years.html | title=Jenny McCarthy: 'I'm Gonna Bring New Year's Eve on Steroids' | publisher=[[Parade (magazine)|Parade]] | date=December 22, 2010 | accessdate=August 15, 2013 | author=Wolf, Jeanne}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also appeared in the 40th anniversary of ABC's New Year celebration where she kissed a nearby New York City cop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jenny McCarthy locked lips with mystery cop on New Year's Eve|url=http://todayentertainment.today.com/_news/2012/01/02/9894625-jenny-mccarthy-locked-lips-with-mystery-cop-on-new-years-eve?lite|publisher=NBC News Online|accessdate=2013-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She appeared in the edition of December 31, 2012 of ''New Year's Rockin' Eve'' and kissed a midshipman of the United States Merchant Marine Academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sealed with a kiss!

She was on the cover of ''Playboy'' in the August 2012 issue after saying she wanted to pose for it again before her 40th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shira |first=Dahvi |url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20606671,00.html |title=Jenny McCarthy Playboy: Photo of Cover – Jenny McCarthy Naked Picture |publisher=People.com |date=2012-06-25 |accessdate=2014-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 17 guest appearances, in July 2013 McCarthy was announced as a new co-host on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]'', replacing former co-host [[Elisabeth Hasselbeck]]. [[Barbara Walters]] praised McCarthy's intelligence, warmth, humor and fresh point of view, and calling her a great addition to the show.&lt;ref name=ABC_News_McCarthy_Hasselbeck&gt;{{cite web

McCarthy once modeled for [[Candie's]], a shoe company. In one magazine ad, McCarthy posed on a toilet seat with her underwear near her ankles. Cultural scholar Collin Gifford Brooke wrote that the ad's "[[taboo]] nature" brought it attention, while noting that the ad itself helped to weaken that taboo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In May 2007, McCarthy announced that her son Evan was diagnosed with [[autism]] in 2005.

McCarthy's book dealing with autism, ''Louder than Words: A Mother's Journey in Healing Autism'', was published September 17, 2007. She stated both in her book and during her appearance on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' that her husband was unable to deal with their son's autism, which led to their divorce. In 2008, she appeared on a ''[[Larry King Live]]'' special dedicated to the subject and argued that [[MMR vaccine controversy|vaccines can trigger autism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gross L |title=A broken trust: lessons from the vaccine–autism wars |journal=PLoS Biol |volume=7 |issue=5 |pages=e1000114 |year=2009 |pmid=19478850 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1000114 |url=http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1000114 |pmc=2682483 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0804/02/lkl.01.html |title=CNN Larry King Live: Jenny McCarthy's Autism Fight, Aired April 2, 2008 |work= |accessdate= May 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an April 27, 2010 PBS ''[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]'' documentary, she was interviewed about the controversy between vaccine opponents and public health experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/ae/tv/articles/2010/04/27/measured_doses_of_fact_friction_in_vaccine_war/ | work=The Boston Globe | title=Measured doses of fact, friction in 'Vaccine War' | first=Don | last=Aucoin | date=April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/vaccines/ "The Vaccine War"], PBS ''[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]'' documentary, April 27, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to conventional, intensive [[Applied behavior analysis#Efficacy in autism|Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA) therapy]], McCarthy tried for her son a [[gluten-free]] and [[casein-free diet]], [[hyperbaric oxygen chamber]]s, [[chelation]], [[aromatherapy|aromatherapies]], electromagnetics, spoons rubbed on his body, multivitamin therapy, B-12 shots, and numerous prescription drugs. "Try everything", she advises parents. "It was amazing to watch, over the course of doing this, how certain therapies work for certain kids and they completely don't work for others.... When something didn't work for Evan, I didn't stop. I stopped that treatment, but I didn't stop."&lt;ref name=Greenfeld/&gt; McCarthy has stated on talk shows and at rallies that [[chelation therapy]] helped her son recover from autism.&lt;ref name="Rochman"&gt;{{cite news|last=Rochman|first=Bonnie|title=Jenny McCarthy, Vaccine Expert?

McCarthy's public presence and vocal activism on the [[vaccination-autism controversy]], led, in 2008, to her being awarded the [[James Randi]] Educational Foundation's [[Pigasus Award]], which is a [[tongue-in-cheek]] award granted for contributions to [[pseudoscience]], for the "Performer Who Has Fooled the Greatest Number of People with the Least Amount of Effort". Randi stated in a video on the JREF's website that he did sympathize with the plight of McCarthy and her child, but admonished her for using her public presence in a way that may discourage parents from having their own children vaccinated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/jref-news/500-pigasus-awards-for-2008-announced.html |title=Pigasus Awards for 2008 Announced |accessdate=April 16, 2010 |date=April 1, 2009 |publisher=[[James Randi Educational Foundation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Your quote trail is far too long—and you have been far too wrong—for the truth not to be obvious.&lt;ref name="Kluger_That_Moment"&gt;{{Citation|last=Kluger|first=Jeffrey|title=''"That Moment When You Must Have a Word With Jenny McCarthy"''|date=April 12, 2014|url=http://time.com/60416/jenny-mccarthy-anti-vaccine-whitewash/|publisher=''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''|accessdate=October 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;One month later in May 2014, McCarthy published an opinion-editorial addressing her position on vaccines, which specifically mentions Kluger:&lt;blockquote&gt;I am not "anti-vaccine." This is not a change in my stance nor is it a new position that I have recently adopted. For years, I have repeatedly stated that I am, in fact, "pro-vaccine" and for years I have been wrongly branded as "anti-vaccine."

The ironic thing is my position has always remained the same. People just never listened to it.&lt;ref name="Grove" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In a 2015 ''[[Medscape]]'' article about celebrities who "speak out about illness", [[Jeffrey A. Lieberman]] criticized McCarthy and her views on vaccines, [[thimerosal]], and autism. He had this to say about her influence: "She has no idea what she is talking about. What she said is misleading and harmful, and the measles outbreak is a clear indication of the response to the spread of such pseudoscientific myths."&lt;ref name=Lieberman&gt;{{Citation |last=Lieberman |first=Jeffrey |date=March 12, 2015 |title=Should Celebrities Speak Out About Illness? |work=[[Medscape]] |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/841049 |accessdate=March 17, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Objections to appointment on ''The View'' ===
&lt;!-- [[The View (U.S. TV series)#Objections to McCarthy appointment]] links to this section, so don't change the wording of this heading. --&gt;

McCarthy's appointment to ''The View'' called forth many protests. Amy Pisani of [[Every Child By Two]] stated of McCarthy's anti-vaccination stance, in a letter to ''The View'''s [[Barbara Walters]] and [[Bill Geddie]], that McCarthy's "unfounded claims that vaccines cause autism have been one of the greatest impediments to public health in recent decades", and that McCarthy's assertions "[have] spread fear among young parents, which has led to an increased number of children who have not received life-saving vaccines."&lt;ref name="levin-2013"&gt;{{cite news

|title = Jenny McCarthy joins 'The View'|last = Levin| first = Gary|work=[[USA Today]]| date = July 15, 2013| accessdate = 2013-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Poniewozik]], a television critic for ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, criticized McCarthy's addition to the series and Walters' endorsement of McCarthy, arguing that ''The View'' is largely aimed at parents, on whom the public health system is dependent, and that the credibility that McCarthy's hiring will give her will endanger the public. Poniewozik argued that McCarthy's views, which might be brought up in discussions with the other hosts, would have the effect of framing the issue of whether vaccines cause autism as a matter of opinion, rather than a firmly refuted idea.&lt;ref name="poniewozik-2013"&gt;{{cite news| title = Viruses Don't Care About Your View: Why ABC Shouldn't Have Hired Jenny McCarthy| url = http://entertainment.time.com/2013/07/15/viruses-dont-care-about-your-view-why-abc-shouldnt-have-hired-jenny-mccarthy/| last = Poniewozik| first = James| work=[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]
| date = July 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

David Freeman, senior science editor for ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', wrote about the concerns of [[Bill Nye]], who stated: "I believe Ms. McCarthy's views will be discredited."&lt;ref name=Freeman&gt;{{cite news| title = Bill Nye: Jenny McCarthy's Errant Views On Childhood Vaccines May Be Discredited On 'The View'| url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/15/bill-nye-jenny-mccarthy-childhood-vaccines-autism-the-view_n_3600666.html| last = Freeman| first = David| work=[[The Huffington Post]]
| date = July 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alex Pareene]] also protested and published a letter to ABC in ''[[Salon Magazine]]'', entitled "Anti-vaccine conspiracist and 'View' co-host Jenny McCarthy isn't just quirky—she spreads lies that hurt people."&lt;ref name=Pareene&gt;{{cite web| title = Dear ABC: Putting Jenny McCarthy on "The View" will kill children.

[[Michael Specter]], writing in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', stated:&lt;blockquote&gt;Jenny McCarthy... will be the show's first co-host whose dangerous views on childhood vaccination may—if only indirectly—have contributed to the sickness and death of people throughout the Western world. McCarthy, who is savvy, telegenic, and pulchritudinous, is also the person most visibly associated with the deadly and authoritatively discredited anti-vaccine movement in the United States.&lt;ref name="Specter"&gt;{{cite web| title = Jenny McCarthy's Dangerous Views| url = http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/elements/2013/07/jenny-mccarthys-dangerous-views.html|last = Specter| first = Michael| work=[[The New Yorker]]| date = July 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[Brendan Nyhan]], writing in ''[[Columbia Journalism Review]]'', commented: "ABC's announcement yesterday that actress/comedian Jenny McCarthy will become a co-host of ''The View'' brought forth a torrent of condemnation from doctors, science journalists, opinion writers, and even entertainment commentators who oppose giving the anti-vaccine activist a high-profile platform to spread misinformation." After an extensive review of news coverage of the hiring, Nyhan concluded that "[t]here is no perfect way to cover McCarthy's hiring, of course, but giving 'balanced' coverage to fringe beliefs is the worst approach to covering misinformation."&lt;ref name="Nyhan"&gt;{{cite web| title = When 'he said,' 'she said' is dangerous. Media errs in giving "balanced" coverage to McCarthy's discredited views.| url = http://www.cjr.org/united_states_project/media_errs_giving_balanced_coverage_to_jenny_mccarthys_discredited_views.php?page=all
| last = Nyhan| first = Brendan| work=[[Columbia Journalism Review]]| date = July 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Toronto Public Health]] officially denounced the appointment and "launched a Twitter campaign to get ... McCarthy fired from the ABC show ''The View''", tweeting "Jenny McCarthy's anti-vaccine views = misinformation. Please ask ''The View'' to change their mind", and "Jenny McCarthy cites fraudulent research on vaccines &amp; it's irresponsible to provide her with ''The View'' platform."&lt;ref name="Toronto"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/city_hall/2013/07/22/jenny_mccarthy_in_the_crosshairs_toronto_public_health_takes_aim.html|title=Jenny McCarthy in the crosshairs: Toronto Public Health takes aim|last=Dale|first=Daniel|date=July 22, 2013|work=[[Toronto Star]]|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Katrina vanden Heuvel]], member of the [[Council on Foreign Relations]] and Editor of ''[[The Nation]]'', objected to the appointment and wrote about "Jenny McCarthy's Vaccination Fear-Mongering and the Cult of False Equivalence":&lt;blockquote&gt;One of the most prominent promoters of this falsehood [that vaccines cause autism] is actress Jenny McCarthy, who was recently named as Elisabeth Hasselbeck's replacement on ABC's hit daytime talk-show, ''The View''. Once she's on air, it will be difficult to prevent her from advocating for the anti-vaccine movement. And the mere act of hiring her would seem to credit her as a reliable source....By giving science deniers a public forum, media outlets implicitly condone their claims as legitimate....False equivalency is one of journalism's great pitfalls, and in an effort to achieve "balance", reporters often obscure the truth. What's the merit in "he said, she said" reporting when he says the world is round and she insists it is flat. Indeed, there is an enormous cost to society when the truth could save lives.&lt;ref name="vandenHeuvel"&gt;{{cite web| title = Jenny McCarthy's Vaccination Fear-Mongering and the Cult of False Equivalence| url = http://www.thenation.com/blog/175388/jenny-mccarthys-vaccination-fear-mongering-and-cult-false-equivalence| last = vanden Heuvel| first = Katrina| work=[[The Nation]]| date = July 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;McCarthy responded to the criticism during her media tour to promote ''The View''. Appearing on ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'', where Stern praised her for landing such a "legitimate job", McCarthy explained that she is not anti-vaccine, but rather she opposes too many vaccines in one sitting because that, she said, causes "[[immune dysregulation]]", which she said can cause autism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpnER2gPQDE |work=The Howard Stern Show|title=Jenny McCarthy Interview |date=Sep 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
