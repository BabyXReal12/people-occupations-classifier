'''Alexei David Sayle''' (born 7 August 1952) is an English stand-up comedian, actor, author and former recording artist, and was a central figure in the [[alternative comedy]] movement in the late 1970s and early 1980s. He was voted the 18th greatest stand-up comic on [[Channel 4]]'s 100 Greatest Stand-ups in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/100_greatest_stand_ups/episodes/1/1/ |title=The 100 Greatest Stand-Ups - Episode 1.1. The 100 Greatest Stand-Ups 2007 - British Comedy Guide |publisher=Comedy.co.uk |date=18 March 2007 |accessdate=21 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the updated 2010 poll he came 72nd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-100-greatest-stand-ups/articles/greatest-stand-ups-of-all-time |title=The 100 Greatest Stand-Ups – Announcements – Greatest Stand-Ups of All Time! |publisher=Channel 4 |date=11 April 2010 |accessdate=21 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of Sayle's humour is in the tradition of [[Spike Milligan]] and [[Monty Python]], with riffs based on absurd and [[Surreal humour|surreal]] premises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/alexeisaylesstuff/ |title=Comedy – Alexei Sayle's Stuff |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=21 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His act is noted for its cynicism and political awareness, as well as [[physical comedy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Matt Trueman |url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/nov/17/alexei-sayle-returns-standup-comedy |title=Alexei Sayle returns to standup after 16-year break|publisher=Guardian |date= 17 November 2011|accessdate=21 July 2012 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Sayle was born and brought up in [[Anfield, Liverpool]], the son of Molly (Malka) Sayle (née Mendelson), a [[Football pools|pools]] clerk, and Joseph Henry Sayle, a railway guard,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/476813/ |title=Sayle, Alexei (1952–) Biography |publisher=screenonline |date= |accessdate=12 April 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110525044523/http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/476813/| archivedate= 25 May 2011 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; both of whom were members of the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]]. Sayle's mother was of [[Lithuanian Jews|Lithuanian Jewish]] descent,&lt;ref name=rel&gt;{{Cite news|last=Neilan|first=Catherine|title='Ullo Alexei! Gotta new memoir?|pages=|publisher=theBookseller.com|date=22 July 2010|url=http://www.thebookseller.com/profile/ullo-alexei-gotta-new-memoir|accessdate=17 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some members of his mother's family were very devout Jews, as he mentioned when he nominated Palestinian rights advocate [[Edward Said]] on the [[BBC Radio 4]] programme ''[[Great Lives]]''. In the aftermath of the [[May 1968 in France|May 1968 French uprising]], he joined the [[Communist Party of Britain (Marxist–Leninist)]].

In later years he has said that, while no longer active in left politics, "I still would adhere to those philosophical and economic ideas of Marxism that I got when I was sixteen. ... it's seemed to me as true now as it did then".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Alexei Sayle, Personal Reminiscence |publisher=Imperial War Museum|year=2009|url=http://whatliesbeneath.org.uk/server.php?show=nav.24262|accessdate=29 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1964 to 1969 he attended [[Alsop High School]] in [[Walton, Liverpool|Walton]], and was expelled halfway through [[sixth form]].&lt;ref name="Wilmut-1989"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilmut|first=Roger|title=Didn't You Kill My Mother In Law?- the story of alternative comedy in Britain from the Comedy Store to Saturday Night Live|year=1989|publisher=Methuen|location=UK|isbn=0-413-17390-9|pages=22–24|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mrQqAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; After that, Sayle took a [[foundation course]] in art at [[Southport]], before attending [[Chelsea College of Art and Design]] in London. He attended [[Garnett College]], [[Roehampton]], a training college for teachers in further education.&lt;ref name="alexeisayle.me"/&gt;

==Career==

===Stand-up comedy and theatre===
When the [[The Comedy Store, London|Comedy Store]] opened in London in 1979, Sayle responded to an advert in ''[[Private Eye]]'' for would-be comedians&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2014/02/19/19635/how_the_bland_and_the_posh_failed_alternative_comedy |title=How the bland and the posh failed alternative comedy : News 2014 : Chortle : The UK Comedy Guide |publisher=Chortle |date=19 February 2014 |accessdate=6 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became its first [[master of ceremonies]]. In 1980, comedy producer [[Martin Lewis (humorist)|Martin Lewis]] saw Sayle perform at the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] and became his manager.

Sayle became the leading performer at [[the Comic Strip]].&lt;ref name="Over21-1981"&gt;{{cite web | first=David | last=Johnson | title= Something Funny is Happening in Stripland | url= https://shapersofthe80s.com/seismic-shifts/1980-a-new-decade-demands-new-comedy/ |work=Over21, page 36, republished at Shapersofthe80s | location=London | accessdate=2018-04-07 |date=1981-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; He appeared on ''The Comic Strip Album'' (1981) and recorded ''[[Cak!]]'' (1982). He also appeared in the stage show, film and comedy album of ''[[The Secret Policeman's Other Ball]]'' (1981–1982). Sayle's material covered a broad range of topics, but one of his favourite subjects remained politics. His angry persona, coupled with his vociferous delivery, gave immense bite to his material. A typical example of Sayle's humour was his attack on American phrases: "If you travel to the States ... they have a lot of different words than like what we use. For instance: they say 'elevator', we say 'lift'; they say 'drapes', we say 'curtains'; they say 'president', we say 'seriously deranged git!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/keywords/git.html |title=Git Quotes |publisher=BrainyQuote |date= |accessdate=21 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, Sayle played the role of Trinculo in [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[The Tempest]]'', directed by [[Jonathan Miller]] at [[the Old Vic]] theatre in London.&lt;ref name="alexeisayle.me"/&gt;
Sixteen years on from his last stand-up comedy tour, Sayle returned in 2011 as an MC, compering the middle section of ''At Last! The 1981 Show'', curated by [[Stewart Lee]] at the [[Royal Festival Hall]]. Although this was mainly a nostalgia night with comedians such as [[Nigel Planer]] and [[Norman Lovett]] revisiting their material from the 1980s, Sayle premiered some new material that was more anecdotal than his previous work. Sayle says of his old style: "What I was doing, which I hadn’t realised, was a comic persona. The guy in the tight suit was actually a creation. I thought it was me in a sense but it wasn’t."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Davis |first=Laura |url=http://www.liverpooldailypost.co.uk/liverpool-culture/liverpool-arts/2013/04/11/interview-alexei-sayle-on-thatcher-his-film-and-stand-up-careers-and-appearing-at-clapperboard-presents-at-fact-99623-33144934/ |title=INTERVIEW: Alexei Sayle on Thatcher, his film and stand-up careers and appearing at Clapperboard Presents at FACT – Liverpool Arts – Culture |work=Liverpool Daily Post |date=11 April 2013 |accessdate=24 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside artists such as [[Isy Suttie]] and [[Jim Bob]], Sayle appeared at the fourth "[[Nine Lessons and Carols for Godless People]]" event at the Bloomsbury Theatre in December 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nine Lessons and Carols for Godless People|url=http://www.thebloomsbury.com/event/run/1604|work=Bloomsbury Theatre|publisher=The Bloomsbury Theatre|accessdate=10 June 2013|date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January and February 2012, he compered four nights of stand-up comedy at the [[Soho Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/comedy/9039434/Alexei-Sayle-Presents-Soho-Theatre-review.html |title=Alexei Sayle Presents, Soho Theatre, review |publisher=Telegraph |date= 26 January 2012|accessdate=21 July 2012 |location=London |first=Dominic |last=Cavendish}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He completed a full UK stand-up tour in October and November 2012, and a sixteen-night residency at the Soho Theatre in January and February 2013, where he performed new material. He played a further ten nights at the Soho Theatre in April 2013. He continues to tour and performed at the 2013 [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alexei Sayle|url=https://www.edfringe.com/whats-on/comedy/alexei-sayle|work=Edinburgh Fringe Festival|publisher=EFFS Registered Charity SC|accessdate=18 September 2013|date=25 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radio===
Sayle's early work included several performances for [[Capital London]]. In 1979 he wrote and performed the radio series, ''Alexei Sayle and the Fish People'', for which he won a Pye Radio Award (later known as the [[Sony award|Sony Radio Awards]]). Sayle later released an album based on the show – ''[[The Fish People Tapes]]''. This was followed by ''Alexei Sayle and the Dutch Lieutenant's Trousers'' in 1980 – the name being a reference to [[John Fowles]]' [[The French Lieutenant's Woman|book]].&lt;ref name="alexeisayle.me"/&gt; He has since contributed to many other radio shows, including writing the five-part sitcom series, ''Sorry About Last Night'' (1999), in which he also played the leading role. On 3 November 2006 he presented ''Chopwell Soviet'', a 30-minute programme on [[BBC Radio 4]] that reviewed the [[Chopwell]] miners 80 years after the village of Chopwell became known as Little Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/pip/48cfy |title=Radio 4 – History – Chopwell Soviet |publisher=BBC |date=3 November 2006 |accessdate=12 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sayle returned to Radio 4 in 2016 with ''Alexei Sayle's Imaginary Sandwich Bar''.

===Television===
Sayle's first high-profile television appearances were on [[Central Independent Television]]'s late-night alternative cabaret show ''[[O.T.T.]]'' (1982). He left nine weeks into the show's run to tour Australia with the Comic Strip. He played various roles in the situation comedy ''[[The Young Ones (TV series)|The Young Ones]]'' (1982–1984), along with [[Adrian Edmondson]], [[Rik Mayall]], [[Nigel Planer]] and [[Christopher Ryan]]. In the programme Sayle portrayed several members of an [[Eastern Europe]]an family; the Balowskis. In 1985, he appeared in the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' serial ''[[Revelation of the Daleks]]''. In a column for a British tabloid newspaper around the same time, he indicated that he wanted to become the "first Socialist [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|Doctor]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.lep.co.uk/entertainmentav/39Old-geezer39-Alexei-wants-to.4657149.jp |title='Old geezer' Alexei wants to be the next Doctor Who – News |publisher=lep.co.uk |date= 4 November 2008|accessdate=12 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also appeared in several episodes of ''The Comic Strip Presents...'' between 1985 and 1993, most notably playing the two leading roles in "''[[Didn't You Kill My Brother?]]''" which he co-wrote with [[David Stafford (writer)|David Stafford]] and [[Pauline Melville]]. Sayle has co-written and starred in many other programmes, including three series of  ''[[Alexei Sayle's Stuff]]'' (1988–1991), two series of ''[[The All New Alexei Sayle Show]]'' (1994–1995) and one series of ''[[Alexei Sayle's Merry-Go-Round]]'' (1998).

In 1989, Sayle was awarded an International [[Emmy]] for ''Stuff''. In conversation with [[Mark Thomas]] on BBC Radio 4's informal chat-show ''[[Chain Reaction (radio)|Chain Reaction]]'', Sayle revealed that the first he knew of the award was when he watched ''[[Channel 4 news|Channel 4 News]]'' and saw, to his amazement, [[Benny Hill]] collecting the award on his behalf. In 1990, Sayle had a [[fatwa]] proclaimed against him by a Muslim cleric from [[Syria]] after a joke on his BBC comedy show ''Stuff''. This fatwa has never been withdrawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/FATWA+ON+ALEXEI%3B+Comic+facing+death+threat.-a061269670 |title=FATWA ON ALEXEI; Comic facing death threat.  |publisher=Free Online Library |date= |accessdate=12 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.websters-dictionary-online.net/definitions/Alexei+Sayle?cx=partner-pub-0939450753529744%3Av0qd01-tdlq&amp;cof=FORID%3A9&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=Alexei+Sayle&amp;sa=Search#874 |title=Dictionary – Definition of Alexei Sayle |publisher=Websters-dictionary-online.net |date=7 August 1952 |accessdate=24 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sayle was signed in 1992 to a seven-year contract to play an Eastern European chef as a regular character on the American sitcom ''[[The Golden Palace]]'', the sequel to ''[[The Golden Girls]]'', but was fired and replaced by [[Cheech Marin]] before the pilot was shot. The series was cancelled after one season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1992-07-25/entertainment/9203060941_1_golden-girls-golden-palace-bea-arthur|title=3 Golden Girls Moving From Their House On Nbc To Cbs` `Palace`|website=Articles.chicagotribune.com|accessdate=30 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alexeisayle.me/home/2013/7/29/blog-74.html|title=Alexei Sayle - Home - Blog 74|website=Alexeisayle.me|accessdate=30 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994 he presented the miniseries ''Drive'', which gave advice for safe driving through Sayle's signature form of humour interspersed with serious pieces. In 2008, he wrote and presented ''Alexei Sayle's Liverpool'', a three-part television series in which he reconnected with his home town. He stated in the programmes that on first hearing that Liverpool was to be awarded the [[European Capital of Culture]], he received much criticism for describing the city as "philistine". He now feels that he does not know whether or not his original statement was true, but as a result of making the series he does now consider Liverpool to be his home, and he has vowed to go back there more often in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.liverpool.com/capital-of-culture/alexi-sayle-s-liverpool.html |title=&amp;#124; What's Hot &amp;#124; Capital Of Culture &amp;#124; ALEXEI SAYLE'S LIVERPOOL |publisher=Liverpool.com |date= |accessdate=12 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sayle also narrated the PIF ''Moon Lighters'' about two moon creatures, Biblock and Hoblock and the dangers of [[lighters]].

Sayle has replaced [[Rolf Harris]] as the narrator for the [[Nick Junior]] and [[Milkshake!]] series ''Olive The Ostrich''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rolf Harris is axed from kids' TV show and cruise ships amid sex abuse allegations|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/rolf-harris-axed-kids-tv-2292141|accessdate=23 September 2013|newspaper=The Mirror|date=21 September 2013|author=Nick Owens}}&lt;/ref&gt; Episodes featuring Sayle's narration commenced broadcasting on 22 July 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Blog 73|url=http://www.alexeisayle.me/home/2013/6/13/blog-73.html|work=Alexei Sayle dot ME|publisher=Alexei Sayle|accessdate=13 June 2013|author=Alexei Sayle|date=13 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film===
Sayle alternates his comedy work with performances as a [[character actor]] ranging from serious (''[[Gorky Park (film)|Gorky Park]]'', 1983) to humorous (''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]'', 1989). He appeared in the 1992 [[Carry On (film series)|Carry On]] film, ''[[Carry On Columbus]]'' along with various modern comedians including Comic Strip founder [[Peter Richardson (actor)|Peter Richardson]], as well as members of the original [[List of Carry On films cast members|''Carry On'' team]].

===Music===
Sayle has released five comedy singles with full musical backing. The most successful of these was "[['Ullo John! Gotta New Motor?]]" which achieved Top 20 chart success in the UK upon re-release in 1984. Produced by [[Clive Langer]] and [[Alan Winstanley]] (who also produced for [[Madness (band)|Madness]] and [[Elvis Costello]]), the record in its [[12-inch single|12-inch]] version achieved notoriety owing to its extensive use of profane language.  The two follow up singles, "Didn't You Kill My Brother?", and "Meanwhile", were taken from the album ''[[Panic (Alexei Sayle album)|Panic]]'', the cover of which parodies the cover of the [[Michael Jackson]] album ''[[Off the Wall]]''.

===Writing===
Sayle has written two short story collections, five novels, including a [[graphic novel]] and a radio series spin-off book, as well as columns for various publications. His book ''Great Bus Journeys of the World'', co-written with David Stafford, is mostly a collection of his columns for ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' and the ''[[Sunday Mirror]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/s/alexei-sayle/alexei-sayles-great-bus-journeys-of-world.htm |title=Alexei Sayle's Great Bus Journeys of the World by Alexei Sayle |publisher=Fantasticfiction.co.uk |date= |accessdate=24 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was one of eight contributory authors to the [[BBC Three]] competition ''End of Story'', in which members of the public completed the second half of stories written by established authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/endofstory/authors/authors.shtml?sayle |title=End of Story – Authors – Alexei Sayle |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=21 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The winning entry to Sayle's story, ''Imitating Katherine Walker'', was written by freelance writer Arthur Allan. Sayle's autobiography ''Stalin Ate My Homework'', which deals with his early life and which he describes as a 'satirical memoir', was published in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Ian Sansom |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/oct/16/stalin-ate-homework-alexei-sayle-review |title=Stalin Ate My Homework by Alexei Sayle – review &amp;#124; Books |publisher=The Guardian |date= 16 October 2010|accessdate=21 July 2012 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 he joined the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' as a motoring columnist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Columnists |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/columnists/9115986/Alexei-Sayle-understanding-the-Austin-Montego.html |title=Alexei Sayle: understanding the Austin Montego |publisher=Telegraph |date= 3 March 2012|accessdate=21 July 2012 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2015 he toured giving readings from the second volume of his autobiography ''Thatcher Stole My Trousers'',&lt;ref&gt;

Sayle is a critic of [[fox hunting]] and was among more than 20 high-profile people who signed a letter to Members of Parliament in 2015 to oppose [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] Prime Minister [[David Cameron]]'s plan to amend the [[Hunting Act 2004]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.stv.tv/scotland-decides/news/1324609-snp-to-vote-against-tories-on-fox-hunting-ban-in-england-and-wales/ |title=SNP to vote against Tories on fox hunting ban in England and Wales |work=STV |date=13 July 2015 |accessdate=17 July 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150715203740/http://news.stv.tv/scotland-decides/news/1324609-snp-to-vote-against-tories-on-fox-hunting-ban-in-england-and-wales/ |archivedate=15 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2016, Sayle said of [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] leader [[Jeremy Corbyn]]; "He's ascetic and morally incorruptible. The propaganda that's thrown against him is disgraceful. Until he appeared, you had to vote for one kind of [[Oxbridge]] twat or another, people who all go to the same dinner parties, people like the [[Ed Balls]]es and [[George Osborne]]s. Jeremy has shown that, within a democratic tradition, other things are possible."&lt;ref name="independent"&gt;{{cite news |last=Walsh|first=John|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/comedy/features/alexei-sayle-interview-the-80s-stand-up-legend-on-drugs-communist-dentists-and-the-comedy-revolution-a6894686.html|title= Why I’ve decided to join the Labour party then immediately resign |work= |location= |publisher=''[[The Independent]]''|date=27 February 2016|accessdate=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, he wrote a comment piece for ''[[The Guardian]]'' saying that he was happy to mock [[New Labour]] in his act but now that Corbyn was about to "reform the party in his own image – ascetic, socialist, kindly and ethical" he would stop making jokes about Labour.&lt;ref name="theguardian"&gt;{{cite news |last=Sayle|first=Alexei|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/12/alexei-sayle-why-i-have-decided-join-labour-party-then-immediately-resign|title= Why I’ve decided to join the Labour party then immediately resign |work= |location= |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|date=16 March 2016|accessdate=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018, regarding the expulsion of [[Marc Wadsworth]] from the Labour Party, Sayle commented: "The Party should walk over broken glass to beg people of Marc's calibre to work with them - they are very few and Marc is one of the best. There is a battle going on to destroy and reverse the unexpected and amazing gains the left has made in the last three years. Marc is a casualty in that battle and I am joining the fight to see him re-instated to the front line."&lt;ref name="voice-online"&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |url=http://www.voice-online.co.uk/article/labour-party-chiefs-spark-backlash-over-wadsworth-expulsion|title=Labour Party chiefs spark backlash over Wadsworth expulsion|work= |location= |publisher=''[[The Voice (newspaper)|The Voice]]''|date=15 May 2018|accessdate=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
