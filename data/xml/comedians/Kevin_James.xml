Both wrestled at 145 lb weight class. A season-ending back injury to James resulted in Foley taking over the first string position.&lt;ref name=hwoodreporter&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywood.com/general/kevin-james-reunited-with-high-school-wrestling-pal-mick-foley-on-tv-57359135|title=Kevin James reunited with high school wrestling pal Mick Foley on TV|author=WENN|work=Hollywood.com|access-date=May 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; James, as well as Foley, went on to study at the [[State University of New York at Cortland]], where he played halfback on the varsity football team until another back injury permanently ended his sporting hopes.&lt;ref name= NYTimesSusan/&gt;&lt;ref name="msndotcom"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msn.com/en-ae/entertainment/people/kevin-james/AA3lDVo|title=Search Results - Entertainment|access-date=May 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
James began doing [[stand-up comedy]] in 1989, making his debut at the East Side Comedy Club on [[Long Island]], managed by Richie Minervini.&lt;ref name= NYTimesSusan /&gt; He gained popularity through numerous appearances on various talk shows, including ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'', ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'', ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'', ''[[Dennis Miller Live]]'', ''[[The Late Late Show (CBS TV series)|The Late Late Show]]'', ''[[The Rosie O'Donnell Show]]'', ''[[The Ellen DeGeneres Show]]'', and ''[[Live with Regis and Kathie Lee]]''. James was listed at #89 on [[Comedy Central]]'s list of the 100 Greatest Stand-Up Comedians. James has also done his stand-up routine on ''[[Just for Laughs]]'', an annual comedy festival in [[Montreal|Montreal, Quebec]]. Later he was on commercials for Mazzio's Italian Eatery. In 2001, James did his own stand-up special called ''Kevin James: Sweat the Small Stuff.'' He has also appeared as a musical guest on ''Just for Laughs''. In 2018, James released another stand-up special on Netflix called ''Kevin James: Never Don’t Give Up.''

===Television===
James' first television job was in 1991 on ''The New Candid Camera'', where he used his comedy timing and improvisation skills playing the actor that pulled the practical jokes on unsuspecting people. James appeared on television as the announcer for the [[MTV]] sports game show ''SandBlast'' from 1994-96. James later moved to [[Los Angeles]] and befriended [[Ray Romano]], and later guest-starred on a few episodes of Romano's hit [[CBS]] sitcom, ''[[Everybody Loves Raymond]]''. These appearances led to the development of his own sitcom, ''[[The King of Queens]]'', which ran on the same network from September 21, 1998, to May 14, 2007. James played [[working class]] parcel delivery man [[Doug Heffernan]] who works for a company known as IPS. He is married to [[Carrie Heffernan|Carrie]] ([[Leah Remini]]), a sharp-tongued, ambitious secretary at a [[Manhattan]] law firm who is far less content with working-class life in [[Queens]]. Her obsessive, vindictive father, [[Arthur Spooner|Arthur]] ([[Jerry Stiller]]), who is capable of bizarre conduct, lives with them. For his work on the [[List of The King of Queens episodes#Season 8: 2005.E2.80.932006|eighth season]], James was nominated for a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/kevin-james|title=Kevin James Emmy Nominated|publisher=Emmys.com|accessdate=October 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

James hosted the 2010 [[Nickelodeon]] [[Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards|Kids' Choice Awards]] on March 27, 2010, and was a nominee into the Arm Fart Hall of Fames of the [[2011 Kids' Choice Awards|next year's show]] as Kevin "Not-Quite-As-Good-As-[[Jack Black|Me]]" James; but lost to [[Josh Duhamel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/kevin-james-host-kids-choice-20724|title=Kevin James to host Kids' Choice Awards|website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|first=Nellie|last=Andreeva|date=March 16, 2010|accessdate=April 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/lat-bwkidduhame_lj21wvnc20110402195527-photo.html|title=Kevin James was robbed!|website=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=April 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

James made his film debut in the 2005 [[romantic comedy]] ''[[Hitch (film)|Hitch]]'', alongside [[Will Smith]] and [[Eva Mendes]].
