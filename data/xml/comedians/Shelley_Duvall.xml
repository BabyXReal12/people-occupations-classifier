Over the duration of her career, Duvall garnered critical acclaim for her portrayals of various eccentric characters.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;

Duvall's most recent performance was in ''[[Manna from Heaven (film)|Manna from Heaven]]'' (2002).

==Early life==
{{expand section|date=August 2014}}

Shelley Alexis Duvall was born on July 7, 1949, in [[Houston]], [[Texas]],&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; the daughter of Bobbie Ruth Crawford and Robert Richardson "Bobby" Duvall (1919–1995), a lawyer (not to be confused with actor [[Robert Duvall]], to whom Shelley is not related).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Robert Richardson Duvall|url=http://records.ancestry.com/robert_richardson_duvall_records.ashx?pid=68766162|publisher=ancestry.com|accessdate=6 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kleiner |first1=Dick |authorlink1=Dick Kleiner |title=Ask Dick |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/22852077/ |work=Santa Maria Times |date=July 12, 1992 |location=Santa Maria, California |page=C2|via=Newspapers.com}} {{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duvall has three brothers: Scott, Shane, and Stewart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Klemesrud|first=Judy|title=Shelley Duvall, An Unlikely Star|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1977/03/23/75054966.pdf|accessdate=15 April 2014|newspaper=New York Times|date=March 23, 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After high school, Duvall sold cosmetics at [[Foley's]] and attended [[South Texas Junior College]], where she majored in nutrition and diet therapy.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/shelley-duvall-20902851|work=Biography.com|title=Shelley Duvall|publisher=[[The Biography Channel]]|accessdate=13 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
She met Robert Altman when he was shooting ''[[Brewster McCloud]]'' (1970) on location. He offered Duvall a part in the film. She said, "I got tired of arguing, and thought maybe I am an actress. They told me to come. I simply got on a plane and did it. I was swept away."&lt;ref name="howdid" /&gt; Duvall had never left Texas before Altman offered her a film role. She flew to [[Hollywood]] and landed the role of a free-spirited love interest to [[Bud Cort]]'s reclusive Brewster in ''[[Brewster McCloud]]''.&lt;ref name="howdid" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dingus|first=Anne|title=What Part Did Shelley Duvall Beat Out Gilda Radner For?|url=http://www.texasmonthly.com/content/shelley-duvall|accessdate=25 May 2014|newspaper=Texas Monthly|date=July 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1970s===
Altman chose Duvall for roles as an unsatisfied [[mail-order bride]] in ''[[McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller]]'' (1971), the daughter of a convict and mistress to [[Keith Carradine]]'s character in ''[[Thieves Like Us (film)|Thieves Like Us]]'' (1974), a spaced-out [[groupie]] in ''[[Nashville (film)|Nashville]]'' (1975), and a sympathetic [[Wild West]] woman in ''[[Buffalo Bill and the Indians, or Sitting Bull's History Lesson]]'' (1976).

The same year, Duvall left Altman to star as Bernice, a wealthy girl from [[Wisconsin]] in [[PBS]]’s adaptation of [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]]’s short story ''[[Bernice Bobs Her Hair]]''. She also hosted an evening of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' and appeared in 5 sketches: "Programming Change," "Video Vixens," "Night of the Moonies," "Van Arguments" and "Goodnights."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Season 2: Episode 21|url=http://snltranscripts.jt.org/76/76u.phtml|publisher=Saturday Night Live Transcripts|accessdate=12 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, Duvall starred as Mildred "Millie" Lammoreaux in Altman's ''[[3 Women]]''. Duvall's performance garnered the award for [[Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] at the [[1977 Cannes Film Festival]] and the [[Los Angeles Film Critics Association|LAFCA Award for Best Actress]], as well as a [[BAFTA]] nomination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=BAFTA Awards|title=BAFTA Awards Search: 1978 Film Actress|accessdate=13 September 2017|url=http://awards.bafta.org/award/1978/film/actress}}&lt;/ref&gt; She appeared in a minor role in [[Woody Allen]]'s ''[[Annie Hall]]'' (1977).&lt;ref name="imdbawards"&gt;{{cite web|title=Shelley Duvall – Awards|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001167/awards|publisher=imdb.com|accessdate=14 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s===
Duvall's next role was Wendy Torrance in ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'' (1980) directed by [[Stanley Kubrick]]. [[Jack Nicholson]] states in the documentary ''[[Stanley Kubrick: A Life in Pictures]]'' that Kubrick was great to work with but that he was "a different director" with Duvall. Because of Kubrick's methodical nature, [[principal photography]] took a year to complete. Kubrick and Duvall argued frequently, although Duvall later said she learned more from working with Kubrick on ''The Shining'' than she did on all her earlier films.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|Y3XT5jC19e0}}{{dead link|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to give ''The Shining'' the psychological horror it needed, director Stanley Kubrick antagonized his actors. The film’s script was changed so often that Nicholson stopped reading each draft. Kubrick intentionally isolated Duvall and argued with her often. Duvall was forced to perform the iconic and exhausting baseball bat scene 127 times. Afterwards, Duvall presented Kubrick with clumps of hair that had fallen out due to the extreme stress of filming.&lt;ref&gt;"Roles that Drove Actors Over the Edge," Shelly Duvall: The Shining, http://www.looper.com/1970/roles-drove-actors-edge/ Accessed 3 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

While Duvall was in London shooting ''The Shining'', Altman asked her to play [[Olive Oyl]] in his big-screen adaptation of ''[[Popeye (film)|Popeye]]'' opposite Robin Williams, a role [[Roger Ebert]] believes she was born to play:
{{quote|Shelley Duvall is like a precious piece of china with a tinkling personality. She looks and sounds like almost nobody else, and if it is true that she was born to play the character Olive Oyl (and does so in Altman's new musical ''Popeye''), it is also true that she has possibly played more really different kinds of characters than almost any other young actress of the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ebert|first=Roger|title=Shelley Duvall Was Ripe for Role of Olive|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1755&amp;dat=19810104&amp;id=JlQ0AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=6mcEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5578,2176306|accessdate=13 April 2014|newspaper=N.Y. Times Wire Service|date=4 January 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Her role of Pansy in [[Terry Gilliam]]'s ''[[Time Bandits]]'' (1981) followed. In 1982, Duvall narrated, hosted and was executive producer of the children's television program ''[[Faerie Tale Theatre]]''. She starred in seven episodes of the series; "[[Rumpelstiltskin]]" (1983), "[[Rapunzel]]" (1983), "[[The Nightingale (fairy tale)|The Nightingale]]" (1983), "[[Snow White|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]" (1984), "[[Puss in Boots]]" (1985), and "[[Aladdin|Aladdin and His Wonderful Lamp]]" (1986). Since the program's first episode "[[The Tale of the Frog Prince (Faerie Tale Theatre episode)|The Frog Prince]]", which starred [[Robin Williams]] and [[Teri Garr]], Duvall produced 27 hour-long episodes of the program. In 1985, she created ''[[Tall Tales &amp; Legends]]'', another one-hour anthology series for [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]], which featured adaptations of American folk tales. As with ''Faerie Tale Theatre'', the series starred well-known Hollywood actors with Duvall as host, executive producer, and occasional guest star. The series ran for nine episodes and garnered Duvall an [[Emmy]] nomination.&lt;ref name="imdbawards" /&gt;

While Duvall was producing ''Fairy Tale Theatre'', it was reported that she was to star as the lead in the film adaptation of [[Tom Robbins]]’s ''[[Even Cowgirls Get the Blues (film)|Even Cowgirls Get the Blues]]'', which starred [[Mick Jagger]], [[Jerry Hall]], her sister Cindy Hall and [[Sissy Spacek]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wilson|first=Earl|title=It's Thumbs Up for Shelley Duvall|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1368&amp;dat=19811125&amp;id=GIFQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=GRIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7087,4563573|accessdate=13 April 2014|newspaper=The Milwaukee Sentinel|date=November 25, 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was delayed and when it released in 1993 it starred an entirely different cast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Even Cowgirls Get the Blues|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106834/|publisher=IMDB.com|accessdate=29 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also landed roles in films and television series: the mother of a boy whose dog is struck by car in [[Tim Burton]]'s short film ''[[Frankenweenie (1984 film)|Frankenweenie]]'' (1984), a lonely and timid woman who receives a message from a flying saucer in ''[[The Twilight Zone (1985 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'' episode "The Once and Future King/[[A Saucer of Loneliness]]", and the friend of [[Steve Martin]]'s character in the comedy ''[[Roxanne (film)|Roxanne]]'' (1987).

In 1988, Duvall founded a new production company called Think Entertainment to develop programs and television movies for cable channels. She created ''[[Nightmare Classics]]'' (1989), a third Showtime anthology series that featured adaptations of well-known horror stories by authors including [[Edgar Allan Poe]]. Unlike the previous two series, ''Nightmare Classics'' was aimed at a teenage and adult audience. It was the least successful series that Duvall produced for Showtime and ran for only four episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nanwalt|first1=Sasha|title=Television; Shelley Duvall Tries Scaring Up A New Audience|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/06/arts/television-shelley-duvall-tries-scaring-up-a-new-audience.html|accessdate=4 June 2014|publisher=New York Times|date=6 August 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990s===
In 1991, Duvall portrayed Jenny Wilcox, wife of Charlie Wilcox ([[Christopher Lloyd]]) in the [[Hulk Hogan]] action-adventure film ''[[Suburban Commando]]''. In October that year, Duvall released two compact discs, ''Hello, I'm Shelley Duvall... Sweet Dreams'' that features Duvall singing lullaby songs and ''Hello, I'm Shelley Duvall... Merry Christmas'', on which Duvall sings Christmas songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hello, I'm Shelley Duvall...Sweet Dreams by Shelley Duvall|url=http://www.mtv.com/artists/shelley-duvall/discography/413673/|publisher=MTV.com|accessdate=7 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shelley Duvall Discography|url=http://www.mtv.com/artists/shelley-duvall/discography/38003/|publisher=MTV.com|accessdate=7 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, Think Entertainment joined the newly formed Universal Family Entertainment to create Duvall's fourth Showtime original series, ''Shelley Duvall's Bedtime Stories'', which featured animated adaptations of children's storybooks with celebrity narrators and garnered her a second Emmy nomination. Duvall produced a fifth series for Showtime, ''[[Mrs. Piggle Wiggle]]'', before selling Think Entertainment in 1993 and retiring as a producer. Duvall's production work gained her six [[CableACE Award]]s and one [[Peabody Award]].&lt;ref name="imdbawards" /&gt; A year later, Duvall landed a guest spot on the television series ''[[L.A. Law]]'' as Margo Stanton, a [[show dog]] owner and breeder who presses charges against the owner of a [[Welsh Corgi]] that mated with her prize-winning [[Afghan Hound]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LA Law Season 8 Episode 19 :: "Tunnel of Love"|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqWNFEiViXc|website=Youtube.com|publisher=Youtube.com|accessdate=4 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She appeared as the vain, over-friendly, but harmless Countess Gemini{{mdash}}sister to the calculating Gilbert Osmond ([[John Malkovich]]){{mdash}}in [[Jane Campion]]'s 1996 adaptation of the [[Henry James]] novel ''[[The Portrait of a Lady (film)|The Portrait of a Lady]]''. A year later, she played a beatific nun in the comedy film ''Changing Habits'' and a besotted, murderous, [[ostrich]]-farm owner in [[Guy Maddin]]'s fourth feature ''[[Twilight of the Ice Nymphs]]''. The same year she played [[Chris Cooper]]'s character's gullible wife who yearns for a better life in [[Horton Foote]]'s made-for-television film, ''Alone''. Duvall continued to make film and television appearances throughout the late-1990s. In 1998, she played [[Drew Barrymore]]'s mother in the comedy ''[[Home Fries]]'' and [[Hilary Duff]]'s aunt in the [[direct-to-video]] children's film ''[[Casper Meets Wendy]]''. Near the end of the decade, she returned to the horror genre with ''[[Tale of the Mummy]]'' (1998) and ''[[The 4th Floor (1999 film)|The 4th Floor]]'' (1999).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shelley Duval|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001167/|website=IMDB.com|publisher=IMDB.com|accessdate=4 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000s===
In the 2000s, Duvall accepted minor roles, including the mother of [[Matthew Lawrence]]'s character in the horror-comedy ''Boltneck'' and [[Haylie Duff]]'s aunt in the independent family film ''Dreams in the Attic'', which was sold to the [[Disney Channel]] but was never released.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Actress Haylie Duff - The Beginning | author = 'Bro Bob' | work = haileyduff.com | date = | accessdate = 2016-10-03 | url = http://www.haileyduff.com/reflect.htm | language = | quote = ...&amp;nbsp;the sad thing was that all these efforts never resulted in the film being sold to anyone.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her most recent acting appearance was a small role in the 2002 independent film ''[[Manna from Heaven (film)|Manna from Heaven]]''.

==Personal life==
Duvall was married to artist Bernard Sampson between 1970 and 1974; the couple divorced as Duvall's acting career accelerated.&lt;ref name="grows up"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kort|first=Michele|title=Shelley Duvall Grows Up: There's a Lot of the Kid Left in the Tenacious Producer Who Put Cable on the Map and Breathed New Life into Children's TV|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-12-15/magazine/tm-866_1_producer-shelley-duvall/4|accessdate=22 October 2017|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=15 December 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While she was shooting in New York for her part in Woody Allen's ''[[Annie Hall]]'' (1977), she met singer/songwriter [[Paul Simon]]. They lived together for two years. Their relationship ended when Duvall introduced Simon to her friend, actress [[Carrie Fisher]]; Fisher took up with Simon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Armstrong|first=Lois|title=Olive's Wasn't the Only 'Popeye' Love Story—Shelley Duvall Snagged a Prince Charming Too|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20078824,00.html|accessdate=15 April 2014|newspaper=People|date=16 March 1981|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416180000/http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20078824,00.html|archivedate=16 April 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly before the release of [[Terry Gilliam]]'s ''[[Time Bandits]]'', it was reported that Duvall and actor Stanley Wilson (who portrayed the town barber in ''Popeye'') were set to marry. However, no further reports were released regarding this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Shelley Duvall Announces Plans to Marry This Year|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=888&amp;dat=19810413&amp;id=x29IAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=hFoDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5494,5006129|accessdate=15 April 2014|newspaper=St. Petersburg Times|date=13 April 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Duvall is an animal lover, caring for and incorporating many of her favorite pets into original children's stories and songs. In the 1980s and 1990s, she lived in [[Benedict Canyon]] in California with her pets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shelley Duvall and the Tales She Tells to Children|author=Horowitz, Joy|date=21 April 1992|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/21/news/shelley-duvall-and-the-tales-she-tells-to-children.html|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.texasmonthly.com/content/shelley-duvall|title=Shelley Duvall|date=1 July 1999|work=Texas Monthly|accessdate=11 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/interviews/interview-with-shelley-duvall|title=Interview with Shelley Duvall|author=Ebert, Roger|authorlink=Roger Ebert|publisher=|accessdate=11 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Duvall has lived out of public view since her retirement in 2002. In November 2016, ''USA Today'' reported that she appeared to be suffering from [[mental illness]].&lt;ref name="mental illness"&gt;{{cite web|title='Shining' actress Shelley Duvall tells Dr. Phil she's mentally ill|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2016/11/17/shining-actress-shelley-duvall-tells-dr-phil-shes-mentally-ill/94031976/|website=USA Today|date=16 November 2017|accessdate=13 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that month, she appeared on an episode of the television show ''[[Dr. Phil (talk show)|Dr. Phil]]''. [[Vivian Kubrick]], whose father directed Duvall in ''[[The_Shining_(film)|The Shining]]'', described the interview as "exploitative entertainment" and "appallingly cruel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/shocking-shelley-duvall-interviews-leads-9282337|title=Shocking Shelley Duvall interviews leads to boycott threats for Dr. Phil|first=Alistair|last=McGeorge|date=18 November 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the episode aired, the nonprofit [[Actors Fund of America]] contacted her about providing assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Robb|first1=David|title=Actors Fund Reaching Out to Help Shelley Duvall After ‘Dr Phil’ Episode|url=http://deadline.com/2016/11/shelley-duvall-dr-phil-actors-fund-help-1201858440/|website=Deadline|accessdate=22 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
