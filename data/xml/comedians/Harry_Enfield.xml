'''Henry Richard Enfield''' (born 30 May 1961)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/loadsa-characters-1350249.html |title=Profile |work=The Independent |date=2 November 1996 | location=London | first=James | last=Rampton | accessdate=4 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an English comedian, actor, writer, and director.  He is known in particular for his television work, including ''[[Harry Enfield's Television Programme]]'' and ''[[Harry &amp; Paul]]'', and for the creation and portrayal of comedy characters such as [[Kevin the Teenager]] and [[Loadsamoney]].

==Early life==
Born in [[Horsham]], [[Sussex]], he is the oldest of three children, the son of English television, radio and newspaper journalist and presenter [[Edward Enfield]]. He has two sisters. He was educated at the independent Arundale School in [[Pulborough]], [[Dorset House School]], [[Worth School]], [[The College of Richard Collyer|Collyer's Sixth Form College]] (all in West Sussex) and the [[University of York]], where he was a member of [[Derwent College, York|Derwent College]] and studied politics. He worked for a while as a [[milkman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/comics/h/33194/harry_enfield|title=Harry Enfield|author=Powder Blue Internet Business Solutions|work=chortle.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
{{anchor|Loadsamoney}}
Enfield first came to wide public attention when appearing on [[Channel 4]]'s ''[[Saturday Live (UK TV series)|Saturday Live]]'' as several different characters created with [[Paul Whitehouse]]. These quickly entered the national consciousness. Among these characters were Stavros, a Greek kebab shop owner with fractured English; and [[Loadsamoney]], an obnoxious, [[Cockney]] [[plasterer]] who constantly boasted about how much money he earned. The Loadsamoney character was created in reaction to the policies of the [[Premiership of Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher government]] of the day, and took on a life of its own, sampling the songs "Money, Money" from the musical [[Cabaret (1972 film)|Cabaret]] and [[Money, Money, Money]] by [[ABBA]] to spawn a hit single in 1988 and a sell-out live tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Biressi|first=Anita|title=Class and Contemporary British Culture|year=2013|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=London|isbn=9780230240568|pages=32–37|first2=Heather |last2=Nunn}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1988, [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] leader [[Neil Kinnock]] used the term ''loadsamoney'' to criticise the policies of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government and journalists began to refer to the "loadsamoney mentality" and the "loadsamoney economy".&lt;ref&gt;''The Cambridge Encyclopedia of The English Language''. Ed. [[David Crystal]]. Cambridge: [[Cambridge University Press]], 1995. p. 133. {{ISBN|0521401798}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a foil to Loadsamoney, Enfield and Whitehouse created the [[Geordie]] "Bugger-All-Money" and in 1988 Enfield appeared as both characters during the Nelson Mandela Birthday Tribute Concert at Wembley Stadium. In time Whitehouse and Enfield became disturbed that Loadsamoney was being seen in a positive light, rather than as a satirical figure, and they had him run over during a [[Comic Relief (charity)|Comic Relief Red Nose Day]] show while leaving the studio after presenting host [[Lenny Henry]] with "the biggest cheque of the night"—a physically huge cheque for ten pence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/comics/h/33194/harry_enfield |title=Harry Enfield's Biography : Chortle |work=The UK Comedy Guide}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enfield created "[[Tory Boy]]", a character which portrayed a young male [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]].

In 1989, Enfield realised a personal project, ''[[Norbert Smith - a Life]]'', a spoof on British theatrical knights slumming in the film industry. He also provided voices for the British satirical puppet show ''[[Spitting Image]]'', and starred as [[Dirk Gently]] in the [[BBC Radio]] adaptations of ''[[Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency#BBC Radio adaptation|Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency]]'' and ''[[The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul (radio serial)|The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul]]''.

===TV series===
[[File:Harry Enfield and Susie Silvey.jpg|thumb|right|Enfield during filming in 1990 with [[Susie Silvey]]]]
[[File:HarryEnfield1988.jpg|thumb|right|Enfield in 1998]]
In 1990, Enfield developed his [[BBC]] sketch show, ''[[Harry Enfield's Television Programme]]'', later called ''Harry Enfield and Chums'', with Whitehouse and [[Kathy Burke]]. Eschewing the [[alternative comedy]] style prevalent at the time, both versions of the show were indebted to early '70s comedians such as [[Dick Emery]] and [[Morecambe and Wise]]. Enfield and his co-performers created another group of nationally recognised characters for these shows, such as ''Stan and Pam Herbert'', who use the catchphrase "We are considerably richer than you" (in an exaggerated West-Midlands accent), ''Tim Nice-But-Dim'', ''[[The Scousers]]'', ''[[Smashie and Nicey]], Wayne and Waynetta Slob, Annoying Kid Brother'', who grew into ''[[Kevin the Teenager]]'', and two old-fashioned presenters, ''Mr Cholmondley-Warner and Grayson''.

In 1991, Enfield played Dermot in the sitcom ''[[Men Behaving Badly]]'' along with [[Martin Clunes]], [[Caroline Quentin]] and [[Leslie Ash]], originally on [[Thames Television]]. Enfield left after the [[List of Men Behaving Badly episodes#Series 1 (1992)|first series]], and was replaced in the [[List of Men Behaving Badly episodes#Series 2 (1992)|second series]] by [[Neil Morrissey]] as Tony. Enfield is a professed fan of [[opera]] and fronted a [[Channel 4]] documentary series on the subject. In 1991 Harry also starred in the series [[Gone to the Dogs (TV series)]] as Little Jim.

After a short break from television, Enfield signed a new contract with [[British Sky Broadcasting|BSkyB]], but produced only one series, ''[[Harry Enfield's Brand Spanking New Show]]''. In 2002 Enfield returned to the BBC with ''Celeb'', a new series based on the comic strip of the same title in ''[[Private Eye (magazine)|Private Eye]]'', as the ageing rockstar Gary Bloke.

In 2002, Enfield was the first guest on the revamped version of BBC's ''[[Top Gear (current format)|Top Gear]]'' and also appeared on the show on 23 November 2008.  Enfield has also narrated various TV documentaries such as the Discovery Wings channel "Classic British Aircraft".

In 2007, he played Jim Stonem in the Channel 4 series ''[[Skins (UK TV series)|Skins]]''. He reprised this role in the second series in 2008, and the third series in 2009. Enfield also directed two episodes of Skins in season two entitled "Chris" and "Tony" in 2008.

He appears often on mainstream television shows. His comedy series ''[[Harry &amp; Paul]]'' (originally titled ''Ruddy Hell! It's Harry &amp; Paul'') started in 2007.

In September 2013 Enfield appeared in the [[BBC Three (former)|BBC Three]] comedy series [[Bad Education (TV series)|''Bad Education'']] as Martin, the father of [[Jack Whitehall]]'s character Alfie.

In October 2014, Enfield and Paul Whitehouse returned to the characters of Frank and George in a sketch for Channel 4's testicular cancer awareness comedy show "[[The Feeling Nuts Comedy Night]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2807416/Men-Behaving-Badly-s-Martin-Clunes-Neil-Morrissey-reunite-one-skit-15-years.html|title=Men Behaving Badly's Martin Clunes and Neil Morrissey reunite for  Feeling Nuts - Daily Mail Online|work=Mail Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2015 Enfield, alongside Whitehouse, in celebration of their 25-year partnership, presented ''An Evening With Harry Enfield and Paul Whitehouse''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b068zpdh|title=BBC Two - An Evening with Harry Enfield and Paul Whitehouse|work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 he appeared as [[John Shakespeare]], father of [[William Shakespeare]], in the sitcom ''[[Upstart Crow]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2015-12-08/david-mitchell-to-play-shakespeare-in-new-bbc2-sitcom&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2016 Enfield appeared as [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]] in the [[Channel 4]] sitcom ''[[The Windsors]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/may/06/channel-4-royal-family-sitcom-the-windsors]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Films ===

In 2000, Enfield appeared in his first leading film role playing Kevin alongside [[Kathy Burke]], who played the character's (male) friend Perry—roles originally created for Enfield's television series—in ''[[Kevin &amp; Perry Go Large]]''. The film charted the pair's attempt to become professional DJs by travelling to the nightclubs of [[Ibiza]] and pestering their idol, the DJ Eyeball Paul, played by [[Rhys Ifans]], while gaining love and losing their virginity. Enfield also appeared as King [[George VI]] in ''[[Churchill: The Hollywood Years]]'' (2004), a satire on Hollywood's tendency to change elements of history. In 2012, he starred with Simon Callow in the film ''Acts of Gordfrey'', which opened in UK cinemas on 27 January.

He reprised his role as Martin in ''The Bad Education Movie'', released on 21 August 2015.

In 2015 Enfield and [[Jessica Hynes]] appeared as Mr and Mrs Jackson in a BBC film of the [[Arthur Ransome]] children’s novel  [[Swallows and Amazons (2016 film)|Swallows and Amazons]].

=== Video games ===

In 2012, a likeness of his character Loadsamoney, named "Harold Lott", was released as a [[Downloadable content|DLC]] skin for the game [[Killing Floor (2009 video game)|''Killing Floor'']].

A sample of the character 'Loadsamoney'(Shut Your Mouth and Look at my Wad)
is used in the 1989 Game "Blood Money".

=== Commercials ===

Enfield appeared in some television commercials before becoming famous, including one made in 1987 for [[Tetley]]. Enfield's commercials include a series made in 1996 for [[Dime Bar]]. One commercial in this series had Enfield as a yokel refusing a Dime bar—smooth on the outside, crunchy on the inside—because he preferred [[armadillo]]s—smooth on the inside, crunchy on the outside. Later Enfield, with Paul Whitehouse, starred in a series of commercials for [[Hula Hoops]] as The Self-Righteous Brothers, characters from Enfield's television show. In 2004 Enfield starred in a series of commercials for [[Burger King]] in the Paraguay as Dr. Angus, a character intended to promote the company's newest hamburger. Two more characters from Enfield's TV series, Mr Cholmondley-Warner and Grayson, also appeared in commercials, for [[Mercury Communications]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/cw-courts-controversy-in-hong-kong-1363870.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Chris | last=Godsmark | date=18 September 1996|title=C&amp;W courts controversy in Hong Kong |accessdate=12 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2004 Enfield provided the voice of "The Roaming Gnome" character used in [[Travelocity]]'s U.S. advertising campaign. Enfield was also in commercials for Worthington Bitter.

=== Music ===

Enfield made a cameo appearance as 'the tea lady' during Blur's performance at the Olympics Closing Ceremony Celebration Concert in London's [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] in [[London2012|2012]].

He also appeared alongside Albarn's other project [[The Good, the Bad &amp; the Queen]] as compere during a live performance at The Tower of London on 9 July 2007.
