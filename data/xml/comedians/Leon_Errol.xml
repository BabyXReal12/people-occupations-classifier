'''Leon Errol''' (born '''Leonce Errol Sims''', July 3, 1881 - October 12, 1951), was an [[Australia]]n-born [[United States|American]] comedian and actor, popular in the first half of the 20th century for his appearances in [[vaudeville]], on Broadway, and in films.

==Biography==
Born in [[Sydney]] to Joseph and Elizabeth Sims, Errol had toured Australia, New Zealand and Great Britain and Ireland in a variety of theatrical settings, including circuses, operettas, and Shakespeare. According to his petition for naturalization (1914), he first came to the United States in 1898, having arrived at the [[Port of San Francisco]]. By 1905, in [[Portland, Oregon]] he managed a touring vaudeville company troupe, giving an early boost to the career of a young comedian named [[Roscoe Arbuckle]].&lt;ref&gt;Errol did not own Portland's Orpheum Theater, as is widely repeated.  http://travsd.wordpress.com/2009/07/03/stars-of-vaudeville-27-leon-erroll/&lt;/ref&gt; In 1908, he made the United States his home.

By 1911 Errol had graduated to the New York big time in the 1911 ''[[Ziegfeld Follies]]'' on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], notably in two skits with the legendary [[Bert Williams]].  Errol's sister, Leda Errol (née Sims) was a personal friend of Ziegfeld Follies star [[Fanny Brice]], and she appeared with him in the Ziegfeld Follies doing one- and two-act plays.  He appeared every year in the Follies through 1915, when he is also credited as director of the show  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibdb.com/person.php?id=14717|title=Leon Errol – Broadway Cast &amp; Staff - IBDB|first=The Broadway|last=League|website=www.ibdb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; that included [[W.C. Fields]], [[Ed Wynn]], as well as [[Marion Davies]] as one of the [[Ziegfeld Girls]].

While balancing vaudeville appearances and a dozen Broadway shows, like the original 1920 production of [[Jerome Kern]]'s ''[[Sally (musical)|Sally]]'', in 1919 Errol achieved the pinnacle of vaudeville success:  headlining at the [[Palace Theatre (Broadway)|Palace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://travsd.wordpress.com/2009/07/03/stars-of-vaudeville-27-leon-erroll/|title=Leon Errol: Rubberlegs|date=3 July 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Errol made his first film, a comic short subject called ''Nearly Spliced'', in 1916 (it was not released before 1921), for pioneering east-coast producer [[George Kleine]].  By 1930 he'd left Broadway and turned his full attention to movies, third-billed for [[Samuel Goldwyn]]'s ''[[One Heavenly Night]]'' in 1931.  The box-office for that film was disappointing, but overall Errol made a smooth transition to [[film]]s in a variety of comedy roles.  His comic trademark was a wobbly, unsteady walk, moving as though on rubber legs; this bit served him well in drunk routines.

Errol starred in a long string of two-reel comedy shorts, which began at [[Columbia Pictures]] in 1933. He also starred in an early three-strip [[Technicolor]] short made at [[Warner Brothers]], ''[[Service With a Smile (1934 film)|Service With a Smile]]'' (released 28 July 1934), just beating the [[RKO Radio Pictures]] release ''[[La Cucaracha (1934 film)|La Cucaracha]]'' (31 August) as the first [[live action]], wholly Technicolor release.

Moving to [[RKO Radio Pictures]] in 1934, he continued to make six shorts per year until his death in 1951. Most of these were marital farces in which Leon would get mixed up with a pretty girl or an involved business proposition, and face the wrath of his wife (usually [[Dorothy Granger]]); the theme tune to the series was the nursery rhyme, ''[[London Bridge Is Falling Down]]''.

Leon Errol is well remembered for his energetic performances in the ''Mexican Spitfire'' movies opposite [[Lupe Vélez]] (1939–43), in which Errol had the recurring dual role of affable Uncle Matt and foggy British nobleman Lord Epping. [[Monogram Pictures|Monogram]] signed Errol to appear as fight manager Knobby Walsh in the eight entries of their  "[[Joe Palooka]]" sports comedies (1946–50).  Leon Errol's best known non-series appearance is in the nonsensical comedy feature ''[[Never Give a Sucker an Even Break]]'' (1941), starring fellow vaudeville and Ziegfeld alumnus W. C. Fields.

On February 4, 1950, Errol appeared on television as a guest on [[The Ed Wynn Show]], broadcast live to the West Coast on [[CBS]] (seen on [[kinescope]] film to the East and Midwest on February 18, 1950).  

Errol's next-to-last film, ''Lord Epping Returns'' in 1951, reprised his famous characterization (and some of the gags) from ''Mexican Spitfire''.

Footage from Errol's short subjects was incorporated into RKO's compilation features ''Variety Time'', ''Make Mine Laughs'', ''Footlight Varieties,'' and ''Merry Mirthquakes''. RKO kept Leon Errol in the public eye by reissuing his older comedies throughout the 1950s. His RKO shorts soon became a staple of syndicated television.

Errol married Stella Chatelaine (born 1886) in [[Denver]], [[Colorado]] in 1906. She died on November 7, 1946 in [[Los Angeles]]. Five years later Errol suffered a fatal heart attack, on October 12, 1951, aged 70. They had no children.
