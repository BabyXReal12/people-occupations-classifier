He is known for his deliberately offensive and controversial style of [[black comedy]], as the host of the [[Comedy Central]] television show ''[[Tosh.0]]'', and as the star of [[stand-up comedy]] tours and specials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dead-frog.com/comedians/comic/daniel_tosh | title = Daniel Tosh | work = Dead-Frog | accessdate = June 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Born in [[Boppard]], [[Rhineland-Palatinate]], [[West Germany]],&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Tosh. "Enlightened Garbage." Comedy Central Records, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Tosh grew up in [[Titusville, Florida]], the son of a Presbyterian minister. After graduating from [[Astronaut High School]] in 1993, Tosh attended the [[University of Central Florida]], graduating in December 1996 with a degree in marketing.&lt;ref name="Thompson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://today.ucf.edu/comedian-daniel-tosh-spotted-at-ucf|title=Comedian Daniel Tosh Spotted at UCF|work=UCF Today|date=April 6, 2011|accessdate=February 24, 2014|author=UCF Staff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among his first jobs was a [[telemarketer]] at [[Central Florida Research Park]]. He said later, "Hey, $15 an hour to annoy people! I really was not preparing myself for the future at all. I had interviews lined up. I sat through one real interview and I was like, 'I wouldn't hire me.' I left halfway through the orientation. That's the closest thing I ever got to a real job."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centralfloridafuture.com/daniel-tosh-from-lake-claire-to-comedy-central-1.2056621|title=Daniel Tosh: From Lake Claire to Comedy Central|publisher=Central Florida Future|date=November 8, 2009|accessdate=August 5, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708131950/http://www.centralfloridafuture.com/daniel-tosh-from-lake-claire-to-comedy-central-1.2056621|archivedate=July 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tosh moved to Los Angeles, but attributes his decision to work in comedy to being raised in Florida, which he considers "flat, hot, and dumb."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dailycollegian.com/2010/10/26/daniel-tosh-of-tosh-o-touring-this-way|title=Daniel Tosh of Tosh.O Touring This Way|work=The Massachusetts Daily Collegian|accessdate=September 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Tosh started touring the comedy club circuit almost immediately after graduating from college. He appeared as one of the "New Faces" at the 1998 [[Just for Laughs]] in [[Montreal]]. His act was televised in 2000 in Montreal at the [[Théâtre Saint-Denis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.com/news/2010/apr/21/daniel-tosh-interview|title=Daniel Tosh Interview|publisher=Santa Barbara Independent|date=April 10, 2010|accessdate=July 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tosh's career break came in 2001 with a performance on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]''. He made appearances on programs such as ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'', ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'' and [[Comedy Central]]'s ''[[Premium Blend]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.americansuperstarmag.com/comedy/Jan07/Daniel_Tosh.php|title=Over The Edge With Daniel Tosh|first=Jessamyn|last=Cuneo|work=American Superstar Magazine|date=January 2007|accessdate=June 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He hosted a local late-night comedy show in Florida called ''Tens'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ke4qpf.com/wami/Legend3.htm |title=The Legend of WAMI-TV|publisher=Ke4qpf.com|accessdate=July 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[WAMI-DT]]&lt;/ref&gt; and served as a spokesman in [[Taco Bell]] commercials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=This Week's Day-by-Day Picks|publisher=[[Houston Press]]|date=March 27, 2003|url=http://www.houstonpress.com/2003-03-27/calendar/this-week-s-day-by-day-picks|accessdate=January 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tosh has been a regular guest on radio shows such as ''[[The Bob &amp; Tom Show]]'', ''[[Loveline]]'', and ''[[Kevin and Bean]]''. In 2003, he performed in his own 30-minute special on ''[[Comedy Central Presents]]''. On June 17, 2007, [[Comedy Central]] aired his stand-up special: ''[[Daniel Tosh: Completely Serious]]''. He hosted an episode of Comedy Central's ''[[Live at Gotham]]''.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Tosh appeared in an episode of [[MTV]]'s ''[[Punk'd]] ''as a criminal who broke into [[Mekhi Phifer]]'s car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Punk'd Season 3 Episode 6|url=http://www.mtv.com/videos/punkd-season-3-episode-6/1557357/playlist.jhtml|accessdate=June 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played a fictional version of himself on "Elevator" produced by [[HBO]]'s Runawaybox&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|title=Daniel Tosh Elevator – YouTube|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fg9rG_tc4t4 |accessdate=November 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had a small role as Cowboy Hat in the feature film ''[[The Love Guru]]'' starring [[Mike Myers (actor)|Mike Myers]]. Of his own acting ability, Tosh says, "I’m not a good actor. I can play myself, and a much gayer version of myself. That’s about my range."&lt;ref name="Tosh by Lacey Rose"/&gt;

Tosh had said he planned to end his career on his 38th birthday, May 29, 2013, if he had not by that time succeeded as a comedian. He said he would do this by committing suicide or retiring to the beach.&lt;ref name="Wenzel"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.denverpost.com/entertainment/ci_11733939?source=rss#ixzz10JfSlGrp|title=Daniel Tosh's jokes sneak up on you while you're already laughing|author=John Wenzel|date=February 20, 2009|publisher=The Denver Post|accessdate=September 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vigil"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2007-08-26/entertainment/17257007_1_comedy-club-daniel-tosh-orlando-comedy|title=At The Top of His Stand-up Game|author=Delfin Vigil|date=August 26, 2007|work=sfgate.com|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle |accessdate=September 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He kept a countdown clock on his website that gave the number of days, minutes, and seconds until his 38th birthday which is when "Daniel's [[Groundhog Day (film)|Groundhog Day]] Ends," a reference to the [[Bill Murray]] film. Tosh has described a comic's routine life on the road as "Groundhog Day".&lt;ref name="Vigil"/&gt;

His special, ''[[Daniel Tosh: Happy Thoughts]]'', premiered on Comedy Central on March 6, 2011, with 3.25 million viewers and a 1.9/5 [[Share (television)|share]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118033597|title='Idol' powers weekly Fox rout|last=Kissell|first=Rick|date=March 9, 2011|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=March 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later released on DVD.

Tosh was an executive producer of, and the voice of "Malloy" in, the [[Comedy Central]] animated sitcom ''[[Brickleberry]]''. The show was cancelled after three seasons on January 7, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/news/brickleberry-comedy-central-cancelled-1201395209|title='Brickleberry' Cancelled By Comedy Central After Three Seasons|author=Elizabeth Wagmeister|work=Variety}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, ''Forbes'' estimated Tosh's net worth at $11 million, tied for ninth place in its list of all top-earning comedians whose income is primarily from stage ticket sales.&lt;ref name="Tosh net worth Forbes"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Top-Earning Comedians of 2013|publisher=Forbes|url=https://www.forbes.com/pictures/eimi45ldg/no-9-daniel-tosh-tie|accessdate=November 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Tosh was criticized for an interaction with a female audience member during a set at a Hollywood comedy club. After telling a series of jokes about rape, an audience member remarked that "rape jokes are never funny". Tosh responded by saying it would be funny if the audience member herself were raped by multiple men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Gibson |first1=Caitlin |title=Yes, you can tell a feminist rape joke.

Tosh's explanation of his non-politically correct humor is "I'm not a misogynistic and racist person...But I do find those jokes funny, so I say them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2011/01/05/daniel-tosh-defends-jokes/|title=Daniel Tosh at TCA: 'I'm not sexist or racist, I just like the jokes'|work=ew.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
