'''Ken Goodwin''' (7 April 1933 &amp;ndash; 18 February 2012) was an English comedian, singer and musician best known for his performances on the [[kITV Network|ITV]] Televisions show ''[[The Comedians (1971 TV series)|The Comedians]]''.&lt;ref name="Jamieson"&gt;Jamieson, Teddy (2004) "The Last Laugh", ''[[Glasgow Herald]]'', 15 May 2004, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
He was born William Kenneth Unwin in [[Manchester]], [[Lancashire]]. His father was a [[Stoker (occupation)|stoker]]. While he was still a child, his mother walked out on the family – an experience he blamed for his insecurity and shyness. His father died from cancer when Unwin was 15.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/feb/29/ken-goodwin|title=Ken Goodwin obituary|last=Hayward|first=Anthony|date=29 February 2012|work=The Guardian|access-date=31 July 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Goodwin was a great fan of [[George Formby]]. He did various jobs and started performing in [[working men's club]]s, telling jokes and playing the [[ukulele]]. He then performed on the [[Royal Variety Show]] in 1971 and in a summer season at the [[London Palladium]], before his television break on ''[[Opportunity Knocks (UK TV series)|Opportunity Knocks]]'' followed by ''[[The Comedians (1971 TV series)|The Comedians]].'' He also appeared on BBC TVs ''[[The Good Old Days (UK TV series)|The Good Old Days]]''.&lt;ref name="who'swho"&gt;{{cite book|date=1985|author=Eddie Pedder|isbn=0-907965-31-8|title=Who's Who on Television, 3rd Edition|publisher=Michael Joseph}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He was the first regular performer on ''The Comedians'' to receive his own solo show on television, as ATV gave him his own TV special in 1972. He was a regular guest on television variety up to 1973, mainly on the ITV channels, with his most memorable slot being on the David Nixon Show in 1973. 
After that, appearances on television dwindled due to his wife's illness. He appeared twice in 1974 and not at all from 1975 onwards. However, he failed to re-appear on television as he started performing again in 1977. As he remained a regular and much sought-after live act, especially in Blackpool, the reason for the demise of his television career is unclear, particularly as other members of ''The Comedians'' (Mike Reid, Charlie Williams, Bernard Manning, Frank Carson, Jim Bowen) overtook Goodwin to have much longer and more successful careers on TV. Particularly so as other comedians have since used similar formats (one-line pun-gags) to glittering careers; most notably Tim Vine. 

He was famous for his giggle and catchphrase, "settle down now" which he used a lot on ''[[The Comedians (1971 TV series)|The 
Comedians]]''.

== Marriages ==
Ken married his first wife, Pat Earith in 1956 she fell ill in 1974. Goodwin abandoned his career to care for her until her death in 1977.  They had been married for 21 years. His second marriage was to singer and dancer Vicki Lane until his death in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.westerndailypress.co.uk/Rags-riches-comedian-gentle-touch/story-15392643-detail/story.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death ==
He died on 18 February 2012 of [[Alzheimer's disease]] in a home in [[Rhos-on-Sea]], [[North Wales]] having lived in nearby [[Llandudno]] since his retirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Phillips|first=Judith|title=Comedians Ken Goodwin dies at Rhos-on-Sea nursing home|url=http://www.northwalesweeklynews.co.uk/conwy-county-news/local-conwy-news/2012/02/23/comedian-ken-goodwin-dies-at-rhos-on-sea-nursing-home-55243-30383596/|accessdate=23 February 2012|newspaper=[[North Wales Weekly News]]|date=23 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
