'''Kevin Spacey Fowler''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|KBEh}} (born July 26, 1959) is an American actor, producer and singer. He began his career as a stage actor during the 1980s before obtaining supporting roles in film and television. He gained critical acclaim in the 1990s that culminated in his first [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] for the [[neo-noir]] crime thriller ''[[The Usual Suspects]]'' (1995) and an [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] for the midlife crisis-themed drama ''[[American Beauty (1999 film)|American Beauty]]'' (1999).

His other starring roles have included the comedy-drama film ''[[Swimming with Sharks]]'' (1994), the psychological thriller ''[[Seven (1995 film)|Seven]]'' (1995), the neo-noir crime film ''[[L.A. Confidential (film)|L.A. Confidential]]'' (1997), the drama ''[[Pay It Forward (film)|Pay It Forward]]'' (2000), the science fiction-mystery film ''[[K-PAX (film)|K-PAX]]'' (2001), the musical biopic ''[[Beyond the Sea (film)|Beyond the Sea]]'' (2004), the superhero film ''[[Superman Returns]]'' (2006), and the action film ''[[Baby Driver]]'' (2017).

In [[Broadway theatre]], Spacey won a [[Tony Award]] in 1991 for his role in ''[[Lost in Yonkers]]''. In 2017, he hosted the [[71st Tony Awards]]. He was the artistic director of [[the Old Vic]] theatre in London from 2004 until stepping down in mid-2015. From 2013 to 2017, Spacey played [[Frank Underwood (House of Cards)|Frank Underwood]] in the [[Netflix]] political drama series [[House of Cards (U.S. TV series)|''House of Cards'']]. For his role as Underwood, he has won a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Television Series Drama]] and two consecutive [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Drama Series|Screen Actors Guild Awards for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Drama Series]].

In October 2017, Spacey was accused by actor [[Anthony Rapp]] of making a sexual advance toward him when Rapp was 14. Shortly after, numerous other men alleged that Spacey had sexually harassed or assaulted them. As a result, Netflix cut all ties with him, shelved his film ''Gore'' and removed him from the cast of the last season of ''House of Cards''. He was to appear in [[Ridley Scott]]'s film ''[[All the Money in the World]]'' as [[J. Paul Getty]]; however, all his scenes were cut from the film, and [[Christopher Plummer]] replaced him in reshoots.

==Early life==
Spacey was born in [[South Orange, New Jersey]], to Kathleen Ann (''née'' Knutson), a secretary, and Thomas Geoffrey Fowler, a [[technical writer]] and data consultant.&lt;ref name="name"&gt;{{cite news|first=Paul |last=Fischer |title=The Alien World of Kevin Spacey |work=FilmMonthly |url=http://www.filmmonthly.com/profiles/Articles/KSpacey/KSpacey.html |location=Chicago, Illinois|date=October 20, 2001 |archivedate=January 24, 2007 |access-date=June 2, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070124110051/http://www.filmmonthly.com/profiles/Articles/KSpacey/KSpacey.html |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dlrehioho&gt;Staff writer (1990), [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=92bJlWbPeKMC&amp;dq=isbn+9780837911106&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Kevin+Spacey Fowler, Kevin Spacey]", in {{cite book | editor-last = Marquis Who's Who | title = Who's who in the world, 1991–1992 (Volume 10) |page=348 | publisher = Marquis Who's Who | location = Wilmette, Illinois | year = 1990 | isbn = 9780837911106 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has an older brother, Randy Fowler, who is a limousine driver and [[Rod Stewart]] impersonator in [[Boise, Idaho]], and a sister, Julie Ann Fowler Keir, an office worker.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|first=Ashley|last=Feinberg|url=http://gawker.com/kevin-spaceys-brother-is-a-limo-driving-rod-stewart-imp-1728756763|title=Kevin Spacey's Brother Is a Limo-Driving Rod Stewart Impersonator in Boise|work=[[Gawker]]|publisher=[[Gawker Media]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date=April 9, 2015 |accessdate=October 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Randy Fowler Memoir"&gt;{{Cite web |first=Kyle|last=Zach|url=http://www.idahostatesman.com/news/business/article41570688.html |title=Meet Randy Fowler, Boise's Rod Stewart-impersonating, limo-driving brother of Kevin Spacey|work=[[Idaho Statesman]] |publisher=[[The McClatchy Company]]|location=Boise, Idaho|date=September 27, 2015|accessdate=November 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His family relocated to [[southern California]] when Spacey was four years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biography.com/people/kevin-spacey-9489645 |title=Kevin Spacey Biography | website = biography.com |publisher=[[Biography (TV series)#A&amp;E|A&amp;E]] |access-date=November 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Randy Fowler (from whom Spacey is estranged)&lt;ref name="Estranged Brothers"&gt;{{Cite web |first1=Nicole | last1=Blanchard | first2 = Dana |last2 = Oland|url=http://www.idahostatesman.com/news/local/article181803111.html |title=Sex allegation against Spacey revives his Boise brother's story of their abusive dad |work=[[Idaho Statesman]] |publisher=[[The McClatchy Company]]|location=Boise, Idaho|date= October 30, 2017| accessdate=October 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; has stated that their father, whom he described as a racist "[[Nazi]] supporter", was sexually and physically abusive, and that Spacey had shut down emotionally and become "very sly and smart" to avoid whippings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Maya| last = Oppenheim | url= https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/kevin-spacey-brother-father-sexual-abuse-actor-randall-fowler-thomas-geoffrey-fowler-a8029776.html| title = Kevin Spacey's brother claims 'Nazi' father sexually abused him | work = [[The Independent]]| publisher=Independent Print Limited |location=London, England|date = October 31, 2017 | accessdate = October 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spacey attended Northridge Military Academy, [[Canoga Park High School]] in the 10th and 11th grades. He graduated [[valedictorian|co-valedictorian]] (along with [[Mare Winningham]]) of the class of 1977 of [[Chatsworth High School]] in [[Chatsworth, Los Angeles|Chatsworth, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first=Barbara| last = Whitney |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/710901/Kevin-Spacey| |title=Kevin Spacey |work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |year=2008 |accessdate=June 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=13 Famous Valedictorians |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/departments/college/?article=FamousValedictorians |work=[[Encarta|MSN Encarta]] |year=2008 |access-date=June 2, 2008 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwR2Tlj8?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/departments/college/?article=FamousValedictorians |archivedate=October 31, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinequest.org/events/159568/conversation-kevin-spacey|title=A Conversation with Kevin Spacey |website=cinequest.org | publisher = Cinequest |location=San Jose, California|access-date=October 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Chatsworth, Spacey starred in the school's senior production of ''[[The Sound of Music]]'', playing the part of [[Georg Ludwig von Trapp|Captain Georg von Trapp]] with Winningham as [[Maria von Trapp]].

Spacey had tried to succeed as a comedian for several years before attending the [[Juilliard School]] in New York City, as a member of [[List of Juilliard School people|Group 12]], where he studied drama with teacher [[Marian Seldes]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Kevin|last=Spacey|url=https://nypost.com/2014/10/10/kevin-spacey-writes-about-his-late-teacher-marian-seldes/|title=Kevin Spacey pays tribute to the Juilliard teacher who gave him ‘wings’|work=[[New York Post]]|publisher=[[News Corp]]|location=New York City|date=October 10, 2014|accessdate=March 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; between 1979 and 1981.

==Career==

===1981–1999===
Spacey's first professional stage appearance was as a [[spear carrier]] in a [[New York Shakespeare Festival]] performance of ''[[Henry VI, Part 1]]'' in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Spacey | first = Kevin|url=http://www.kevinspacey.com/theatre/item/henry-iv-part-one/|title=Henry IV Part One  |website=www.kevinspacey.com|access-date=October 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, he made his first Broadway appearance, as Oswald in a production of [[Henrik Ibsen]]'s ''[[Ghosts (play)|Ghosts]]'', starring [[Liv Ullmann]]. Then he portrayed Philinte in [[Molière]]'s ''[[The Misanthrope]]''. In 1984, he appeared in a production of [[David Rabe]]'s ''[[Hurlyburly]]'', in which he rotated through each of the male parts (he would later play Mickey in the [[Hurlyburly (film)|film version]]). Next came [[Anton Chekhov]]'s ''[[The Seagull]]''. In 1986, he appeared in a production of ''[[Sleuth (play)|Sleuth]]'' in a [[New Jersey]] dinner theatre.&lt;ref name="cornucopia"&gt;{{cite news |first=Pat |last=Cerasaro|url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/article/FLASH-FRIDAY-A-Kevin-Spacey-Cornucopia-Stage-Big-Screen-Small-Screen-NOW-20140502 |title=Flash Friday: A Kevin Spacey Cornucopia — Stage, Big Screen, Small Screen &amp; Now |work=Broadway World |publisher=Wisdom Digital Media|location=New York City|date=May 2, 2014 |accessdate=November 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His prominence as a stage actor began in 1986, when he was cast opposite [[Jack Lemmon]], [[Peter Gallagher]] and [[Bethel Leslie]] as Jamie, the eldest Tyrone son, in [[Jonathan Miller]]'s lauded production of [[Eugene O'Neill]]'s ''[[Long Day's Journey into Night]]''. Lemmon in particular would become a mentor to him&lt;ref name="parade"&gt;{{cite news |first = James| last = Brady  ||url=https://www.kevinspacey.com/press/item/parade/| title=In Step With: Kevin Spacey |work=''[[Parade (magazine)|Parade]]'' | publisher= Athlon Media Group |location=Nashville, Tennessee|via = kevinspacey.com |date = December 5, 2004 |accessdate=February 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was invited, along with Spacey's high school drama teacher, to be present when Spacey received his star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Michael |last = Buckley| url = http://www.playbill.com/article/stage-to-screens-kevin-spacey-talks-about-his-new-film-and-his-idols-com-163095| title=Stage to Screens: Kevin Spacey Talks About His New Film, and His Idols |work=[[Playbill]] |publisher = Playbill Inc.| location=New York City|date= July 27, 2009 |accessdate=October 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his first major television appearance in the second-season premiere of ''[[Crime Story (TV series)|Crime Story]]'', playing a [[Kennedy family|Kennedy-esque]] American senator. Although his interest soon turned to film, Spacey remained actively involved in the live theater community. In 1991, he won a [[Tony Award]] for his portrayal of Uncle Louie in [[Neil Simon]]'s Broadway hit ''[[Lost in Yonkers]]''. Spacey's father was unconvinced that Spacey could make a career for himself as an actor, and did not change his mind until Spacey became well-known.&lt;ref name="abc" /&gt;

Some of Spacey's early roles include a widowed eccentric millionaire on ''[[L.A. Law]]'', the television miniseries ''[[The Murder of Mary Phagan]]'' (1988), opposite Lemmon, and the comedy ''[[See No Evil, Hear No Evil]]'' (1989). He earned a fan base after playing the criminally insane arms dealer Mel Profitt on the television series ''[[Wiseguy]]''. He quickly developed a reputation as a [[character actor]], and was cast in bigger roles, including one-half of a bickering [[Connecticut]] couple in the [[dark comedy]] film ''[[The Ref]]'' (1994), a malicious Hollywood studio boss in the satire ''[[Swimming with Sharks]]'', and the malevolent office manager in the ensemble film ''[[Glengarry Glen Ross (film)|Glengarry Glen Ross]]'' (1992), gaining him positive notices by critics. His performance as the enigmatic criminal Verbal Kint in 1995's ''[[The Usual Suspects]]'' won him the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]].&lt;ref name=tca&gt;{{cite episode |title=Kevin Spacey |series=Inside the Actors Studio |date=July 2, 2000 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26GE33raQNQ |network=Bravo |season=6 |number=10|last=Lipton |first=James (host)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spacey appeared in the 1995 thriller film ''[[Seven (1995 film)|Seven]]'', making a sudden entrance late in the film as the [[serial killer]] John Doe after going unmentioned in the film's advertisements and opening credits. His work in ''Seven'', ''The Usual Suspects'' and ''[[Outbreak (film)|Outbreak]]'' earned him Best Supporting Actor honors at the 1995 [[Society of Texas Film Critics Awards 1995|Society of Texas Film Critics Awards]].&lt;ref name="aas951230"&gt;{{cite news |first=Abraham |last=Levy |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=AASB&amp;p_theme=aasb&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EAD97C511DD8C8F&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM | title=Texas film critics give 'Suspects' top honors |work=[[Austin American-Statesman]]|publisher=[[Cox Media Group]]|location=Austin, Texas|date=December 30, 1995 |accessdate=December 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ac960105"&gt;{{cite news | last = Staff writer | url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/story?oid=oid%3A530347 |title=The Society of Texas Film Critics 1995 Awards |work=[[Austin Chronicle]] | publisher=Austin Chronicle Corp.|location=Austin, Texas|date=January 5, 1996|accessdate=February 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He remarked in 2013: "I think people just like me evil for some reason. They want me to be a son of a bitch."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Chris | last = Nashawaty| title=Kevin Spacey: Good 'n' Evil |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] | publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]]|location=New York City|date=February 8, 2013|accessdate=February 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Spacey played an egomaniacal [[district attorney]] in ''[[A Time to Kill (1996 film)|A Time to Kill]]'' (1996), and founded [[Trigger Street Productions]] in 1997, with the purpose of producing and developing entertainment across various media. He made his directorial debut with the film ''[[Albino Alligator]]'' (1996). The film was a [[box office bomb]], grossing $339,379 with a budget of $6&amp;nbsp;million, but critics praised Spacey's direction. He also voiced Hopper in the animated film ''[[A Bug's Life]]'' (1998).&lt;ref name="cornucopia" /&gt;

===2000–2010===
[[File:Spacey_Star.jpg|thumb|Spacey's star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]], laid in 1999]]
Spacey won universal praise and an [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] for his role as a depressed suburban father who re-evaluates his life in 1999's ''[[American Beauty (1999 film)|American Beauty]]'';&lt;ref name=tca /&gt; the same year, he was honored with a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]. Spacey won the [[Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actor]] and earned another Tony nomination in 1999 for ''[[The Iceman Cometh]]''. In 2001, Spacey co-hosted, with [[Judi Dench]], the ''Unite for the Future Gala'', a UK fundraiser for the British victims of [[September 11 attacks|9/11]] and [[Médecins Sans Frontières]] at London's [[Old Vic Theatre]], produced by [[Harvey Goldsmith]] and [[Dominic Madden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Darst |first=Elizabeth |url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,622938,00.html |title=Kevin Spacey Hosts British Benefit |work=''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' |publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]]|location=New York City|date=November 19, 2001 |accessdate=November 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He played a physically and emotionally scarred grade school teacher in ''[[Pay It Forward (film)|Pay It Forward]]'' (2000), a patient in a mental institution who may or may not be an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] in ''[[K-PAX (film)|K-Pax]]'' (2001), and singer [[Bobby Darin]] in ''[[Beyond the Sea (film)|Beyond the Sea]]'' (2004). The latter was a lifelong dream project for Spacey, who took on co-writing, directing, co-producing and starring duties in the biography/musical about Darin's life, career and relationship with actress [[Sandra Dee]]. Facing little interest for backing in the United States, Spacey went to the United Kingdom and Germany for funding. Almost all of the film was made in [[Berlin]].&lt;ref name="parade" /&gt; Spacey provided his own vocals on the ''Beyond the Sea'' soundtrack and appeared in several tribute concerts around the time of the film's release. He received mostly positive reviews for his singing, as well as a [[Golden Globe]] nomination for his performance. However, reviewers criticized the age disparity between Spacey and Darin, noting that Spacey was too old to convincingly portray Darin, particularly during the early stages of the singer's life depicted in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jay | last=Boyar |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2004-12-29/news/0412280338_1_kevin-spacey-bobby-darin-pop-singer |title=A bit of Darin lives in Spacey |work=[[Orlando Sentinel]] |publisher=Orlando Sentinel Media Group|location=Orlando, Florida| date=December 29, 2004 |access-date=November 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kevin Spacey @ San Diego Comic-Con 2008 - b.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Spacey at the [[San Diego Comic-Con]] 2008]]
Spacey hosted ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' twice: first in 1997 with musical guest [[Beck]] and special guests [[Michael Palin]] and [[John Cleese]] from ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'' and again in May 2006 with musical guest [[Nelly Furtado]]. In 2006, Spacey played [[Lex Luthor]] in the [[Bryan Singer]] [[superhero]] film ''[[Superman Returns]]''. He was to return for its 2009 sequel, but the series was instead rebooted with 2013 film ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ali|last=Plumb |url=http://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/kevin-spacey-jesse-eisenberg-playing-lex-luthor/ |title=Kevin Spacey on Jesse Eisenberg Playing Lex Luthor |work=''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' |location=London, England|date=February 27, 2014 |access-date=November 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spacey also appeared in ''[[Edison (film)|Edison]]'', which received a [[direct-to-video]] release in 2006. In 2008, he played an [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] lecturer in the film ''[[21 (2008 film)|21]]''. The film is based on [[Ben Mezrich]]'s best seller ''[[Bringing Down the House (book)|Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six MIT Students Who Took Vegas for Millions]]'', a story of student MIT card-counters who used [[mathematical probability]] to aid them in card games such as [[blackjack]]. In early 2010, Spacey went to China to star in writer-director [[Dayyan Eng]]'s black comedy film ''[[Inseparable (film)|Inseparable]]'', becoming the first Hollywood actor to star in a fully Chinese-funded film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first = S.T.| last = Vanairsdale |url=http://movieline.com/2012/05/03/kevin-spaceys-chinese-buddy-superhero-movie-inseparable-looks-interesting/ |title=Kevin Spacey's Chinese Buddy-Superhero Movie Inseparable Looks...

Spacey is well known in Hollywood for his [[impressionist (entertainment)|impressions]]. When he appeared on ''[[Inside the Actors Studio]]'', he imitated (at host [[James Lipton]]'s request) [[James Stewart]], [[Johnny Carson]], [[Katharine Hepburn]], [[Clint Eastwood]], [[John Gielgud]], [[Marlon Brando]], [[Christopher Walken]], [[Al Pacino]] and [[Jack Lemmon]].&lt;ref name=tca/&gt; As a young actor in New York City, he used his skill to pretend to be Carson's son to obtain free theater tickets and enter [[Studio 54]].&lt;ref name="fallon"&gt;{{cite episode |series=The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon |credits=Fallon, Jimmy (host) |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PEz8PQ5YPE |network=NBC |title=Kevin Spacey Does a Great Johnny Carson Impression |location=New York City |airdate=May 2, 2014 |season=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Old Vic Theatre Company staged shows eight months out of the year. Spacey's first season started in September 2004, and opened with the British premiere of the play ''[[Cloaca (film)|Cloaca]]'' by [[Maria Goos]], directed by Spacey, which opened to mixed reviews.&lt;ref name="firstseason"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Brief History of the Old Vic |publisher=Old Vic Theatre |url=http://www.oldvictheatre.com/history.php |year=2008 |access-date=June 2, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516082930/http://www.oldvictheatre.com/history.php |archivedate=May 16, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2005 season, Spacey made his UK Shakespearean debut, to good notices, in the [[Richard II of England|title role]] of ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]'' directed by [[Trevor Nunn]].&lt;ref name="firstseason" /&gt;

In mid-2006, Spacey said that he was having the time of his life working at the Old Vic; at that point in his career, he said, he was "trying to do things now that are much bigger and outside [myself]".&lt;ref name="nyt-oldvic"&gt;{{cite news |first=Sarah |last=Lyall |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/29/theater/29spac.html| title=Beyond a Sea of Criticism, All's Well for Kevin Spacey at Old Vic |work=''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' |publisher=The New York Times Media Company|date=May 29, 2006 |accessdate=June 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He performed in productions of ''National Anthems'' by Dennis McIntyre, and ''[[The Philadelphia Story (play)|The Philadelphia Story]]'' by [[Philip Barry]] in which he played C.K. Dexter Haven, the [[Cary Grant]] role in the [[The Philadelphia Story (film)|film version]]. Critics applauded Spacey for taking on the management of a theatre, but noted that while his acting was impressive, his skills and judgment as a producer/manager had yet to develop.&lt;ref name="richardiii"&gt;{{cite web |first=Gazelle |last=Emami|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/10/kevin-spacey-richard-iii_n_1196493.html |title=Kevin Spacey As Richard III: BAM Production Of Sam Mendes Play Begins Its Run |work=[[HuffPost|The Huffington Post]] |publisher=The Huffington Post Media Group|location=New York City|date=October 1, 2012 |accessdate=November 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2006 season, Spacey suffered a major setback with a production of [[Arthur Miller]]'s ''[[Resurrection Blues]]'', directed by [[Robert Altman]].&lt;ref name="bbc20060413"&gt;{{cite news | last = Staff writer |title=Spacey defends Old Vic management |work=[[BBC News]] |date=April 13, 2006 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4905638.stm |access-date=June 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite an all-star cast (including [[Matthew Modine]] and future ''House of Cards'' co-star [[Neve Campbell]]) and the pedigree of Miller's script, Spacey's decision to lure Altman to the stage proved disastrous: after a fraught rehearsal period, the play opened to a critical panning, and closed after only a few weeks.&lt;ref name="nyt-oldvic" /&gt; Later in the year, Spacey starred in [[Eugene O'Neill]]'s ''[[A Moon for the Misbegotten]]'', along with [[Colm Meaney]] and [[Eve Best]]. The play received excellent reviews for Spacey and Best, and was transferred to Broadway in 2007. For the spring part of the 2007–08 season, [[Jeff Goldblum]] and [[Laura Michelle Kelly]] joined Spacey as the three characters in [[David Mamet]]'s 1988 play ''[[Speed-the-Plow]]''.&lt;ref name="stage20071210"&gt;{{cite news |first=Alistair |last=Page |url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/newsstory.php/19128/goldblum-to-join-spacey-in-the-old-vics|title=Goldblum to join Spacey in the Old Vic's Speed-the-Plow |work=[[The Stage]] | publisher=The Stage Media Company Limited| location=London, England| date=10 December 2007 |accessdate=2 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, he directed the premiere of [[Joe Sutton]]'s ''[[Complicit (play)|Complicit]]'', with [[Richard Dreyfuss]], [[David Suchet]] and [[Elizabeth McGovern]].&lt;ref name="richardiii" /&gt; Later that year, [[Trevor Nunn]] directed Spacey in a revival of ''[[Inherit the Wind (play)|Inherit the Wind]]''. Spacey played defense lawyer Henry Drummond, a role that was made famous by [[Spencer Tracy]] in the [[Inherit the Wind (1960 film)|1960 film of the same name]].&lt;ref name="richardiii" /&gt;

[[Sam Mendes]] directed Spacey in Shakespeare's ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]''; Spacey played the [[Richard III of England|title role]].

==Political views and activism==
[[File:Kevin Spacey - Clinton Global Citizen 2010.jpg|thumb|right|Spacey speaks during the [[Clinton Foundation#Clinton Global Citizens Awards|Clinton Global Citizen Awards]].]]
Spacey's political views have been described as [[Left-wing politics|left-leaning]] and mirroring some of those possessed by his [[Frank Underwood (House of Cards)|fictional character]] in ''[[House of Cards (U.S. TV series)|House of Cards]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rubenoff |first=Sarah |url=https://www.romper.com/p/is-kevin-spacey-a-democrat-republican-the-house-of-cards-star-is-super-passionate-about-politics-6470 |title=Is Kevin Spacey A Democrat Or Republican?

Spacey met [[Venezuela]]n president [[Hugo Chávez]] in September 2007, but never spoke to the press about their encounter.

In 1999, reports suggested Spacey was dating a [[script supervisor]] named Dianne Dreyer, with their relationship possibly dating back as far as 1992.&lt;ref name="Gotham"&gt;{{cite news |first=Sara |last=Bliss |title=The Drama King |url=http://kspacey.egloos.com/25064 |work=[[Gotham (magazine)|Gotham Magazine]] |publisher=Niche Media LLC|location=New York City| date=May 2007 |access-date=November 17, 2008 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Josh |last=Wolk |title=The Parties |url= http://ew.com/article/2000/04/07/post-oscar-parties/ |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] | publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]]|location=New York City| date=April 7, 2000 | access-date = January 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = EW staff |title=The days before the Oscars |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,313173,00.html |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] | publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]]|location=New York City|date=April 7, 2000 | access-date = January 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, Spacey brought Dreyer to the [[Academy Awards]];&lt;ref name="Gotham" /&gt; during the acceptance speech for his Best Actor award, Spacey stated, "Dianne, thank you for teaching me about caring about the right things, and I love you."&lt;ref name="academy"&gt;{{cite AV media | people= [[Gwyneth Paltrow]] (presenter), Kevin Spacey (recipient) | date= January 4, 2010 |accessdate= October 31, 2017 | title= Kevin Spacey Wins Best Actor: 2000 Oscars | medium= Video | publisher= [[Academy Awards|Oscars]] via [[YouTube]] | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCjt7PME5_E }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, ''[[Gotham (magazine)|Gotham]]'' magazine quoted Spacey saying:&lt;blockquote&gt;I've never believed in pimping my personal life out for publicity. Although I might be interested in doing it, I will never do it. People can gossip all they want; they can speculate all they want. I just happened to believe that there's a separation between the public life and the private life. Everybody has the right to a private life no matter what their professions are.&lt;ref name="Gotham2"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Drama King|last=Bliss|first=Sara|date=May 2007|work=[[Gotham (magazine)|Gotham Magazine]]|publisher=Niche Media LLC|location=New York City|access-date=November 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In October 2017, Spacey [[coming out|came out]] as gay when he apologized to Anthony Rapp for a drunken sexual advance that he had allegedly made (but said he did not recall making) to the then 14-year-old Rapp in 1986; Spacey said, "I have had relationships with both men and women. I have loved and had romantic encounters with men throughout my life, and I choose now to live as a gay man."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet |last=Spacey |first=Kevin |user=kevinspacey |number=924848412842971136 |date=October 29, 2017 |title=[Image of note.] |archive-url=https://archive.is/20171030053834/https://twitter.com/kevinspacey/status/924848412842971136 |archive-date=October 30, 2017 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian-convery"&gt;{{cite news | first = Stephanie | last = Convery |url = https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/30/kevin-spacey-anthony-rapp-apologises-accused-sexual-advance-14-year-old-boy | title = Kevin Spacey apologises after being accused of sexual advance on 14-year-old actor| work = [[The Guardian]] | publisher=Guardian Media Group| location = London |date = October 30, 2017 | accessdate = October 30, 2017 | archive-date = November 1, 2017 | dead-url = no | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171101201210/https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/30/kevin-spacey-anthony-rapp-apologises-accused-sexual-advance-14-year-old-boy}}&lt;/ref&gt; His decision to come out via his statement was criticized by prominent members of the gay community, including [[Billy Eichner]], [[George Takei]], and [[Wanda Sykes]], as an attempt to change the subject from Rapp's accusation, for using his own drunkenness as an excuse for making sexual advances to a minor, and for implying a connection between being gay and sexually assaulting a minor.&lt;ref name="CNN_out"&gt;{{cite news | first = Lisa| last = Respers France |title=Kevin Spacey criticized for how he came out |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2017/10/30/entertainment/kevin-spacey-gay/index.html |work = [[CNN]] | date = October 30, 2017 | accessdate = November 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Mark|last=Kennedy|title='House of Cards' canceled as fallout continues for Spacey |url=http://www.twincities.com/2017/10/30/kevin-spacey-slammed-for-timing-of-coming-out-as-gay|work=[[St. Paul Pioneer Press]] |publisher=MediaNews Group|location=St. Paul, Minnesota|date=October 30, 2017 |accessdate=October 31, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171102194521/http://www.twincities.com/2017/10/30/kevin-spacey-slammed-for-timing-of-coming-out-as-gay |archive-date=November 2, 2017 |dead-url=no |via=[[Associated Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT_Criticized"&gt;{{cite news |first=Daniel|last=Victor|title=Kevin Spacey criticized for using apology to Anthony Rapp to come out |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/arts/kevin-spacey-reaction.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=The New York Times Company|location=New York City|date=October 30, 2017 |access-date=November 2, 2017 |archive-date=November 3, 2017 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171103003948/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/arts/kevin-spacey-reaction.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
