==Early life==
Adam Hartle grew up in Jacksonville, FL. He is half Iraqi on his Mother's side whose parents were both born in Mosul, Iraq and immigrated to the US in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ossifamily.com/Ossi_Family/Joseph_Ossi_Branch.html&lt;/ref&gt; He attended college at the nearby University of Florida where he worked for the Florida Gator football team as a student assistant in the video department for then head Coach [[Steve Spurrier]]. His duties included filming practices and games for the coaching staff . By the time Hartle was a Senior, he'd gotten to know the staff so well he was able to sit in on strategic team meetings. Upon graduating, with a letter of recommendation from Coach Spurrier, Hartle began coaching high school football despite having never played himself. At the age of 22, Hartle became the head JV Coach at Mandarin High School making him the youngest head Coach in the State of Florida. Two years later he served as the running backs Coach at nearby Nease High School where he Coached then 16 year old [[Tim Tebow]]. In 2004 Hartle rejoined the Florida football team full-time as the game analysis coordinator. In 2005, Hartle introduced Tebow to then head coach [[Urban Meyer]] and was an integral part of his recruiting process in which he'd go on to become the greatest college Quarterback of all time.

==Activism==
Hartle has lost 3 relatives to the [[opioid epidemic]] in Florida and is vocal supporter of the cannabis legalization movement as a safe, natural pain relieving alternate to dangerous and addictive pain pills.
