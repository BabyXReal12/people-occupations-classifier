He is of [[Mexicans|Mexican]] (from [[Tijuana]]) descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Al-Madrigal-to-play-the-Punch-Line-3271245.php |title=Al Madrigal to play the Punch Line |author=Tamara Straus |publisher=San Francisco Chronicle |accessdate=2013-06-25 |date=March 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/almadrigal/status/413468097345880065 Twitter]&lt;/ref&gt; He attended Ecole Notre Dame Des Victoires,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Citation|last=Comedy Central|title=This Is Not Happening - Al Madrigal - Becoming a Latino Comic - Uncensored|date=2016-03-21|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgsRw4M6Ogo&amp;feature=youtu.be|accessdate=2018-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; a private Catholic school in San Francisco that emphasizes instruction of French language and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ndvsf.org/school/about/|title=About|date=2015-10-22|work=Ecole Notre Dame des Victoires|access-date=2018-01-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[St. Ignatius College Preparatory]] High School for the class of 1989. He then attended the [[University of San Francisco]], but dropped out shortly afterward.

Madrigal worked for 10 years in a human resources staffing agency run by his family, where one of his main responsibilities was firing people. He often worked humor into the job. For example, he once called a man into his own office and started shouting racial epithets while doing a Nicolas Cage impression. He credits his experiences at the staffing company with preparing him for stand-up comedy: "I was in so many scary situations ... by the time I got on stage, I had no stage fright. Speaking in front of a group was nothing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Borrelli|first1=Christopher|title=Al Madrigal: A Comic Who Knows How to Let Go|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-08-01/entertainment/ct-ent-0801-al-madrigal-20130801_1_john-hodgman-comic-al-madrigal|website=Chicago Tribune|publisher=chicagotribune.com|accessdate=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, he decided to pursue a full-time career in comedy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latinostandup.com/pages/almad.html “Al Madrigal,” LatinoStandup.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080727003611/http://www.latinostandup.com/pages/almad.html |date=2008-07-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===Stand-up comedy===
Madrigal’s stand-up comedy is story-based, centering on his personal life, family, and the confusion caused by his multiethnic background.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=George|first1=Doug|title=In English, Madrigal is doing just fine|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2009-07-31/entertainment/0907290432_1_comedy-arts-festival-madrigal-mexican|website=Chicago Tribune|publisher=chicagotribune.com|accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early in his comedy career, he was often pigeonholed as a “Latino comic.” Madrigal says he has been criticized as not being Latino enough, such as for not speaking Spanish.&lt;ref name="V Digital Services"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Minazad|first1=Orly|title=THE DAILY SHOW CORRESPONDENT AL MADRIGAL IS FIGHTING LATINO STEREOTYPES — WITH COMEDY|url=http://www.laweekly.com/arts/the-daily-show-correspondent-al-madrigal-is-fighting-latino-stereotypes-with-comedy-5534030|website=LA Weekly|publisher=V Digital Services|accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Madrigal began his career in San Francisco's [[comedy club]]s, both as a solo performer and as a member of the sketch group Fresh Robots, which he co-founded. In 2002, he enjoyed his first major exposure in two comedy festivals: [[SF Sketchfest]], as part of Fresh Robots,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/chronicle/archive/2002/01/03/DD29268.DTL&amp;type=printable "Jokers Run Wild," January 3, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt; and the "New Faces" showcase of the [[Just for Laughs Festival]] in [[Montreal]].&lt;ref name=BG&gt;[http://www.boston.com/ae/theater_arts/articles/2008/06/27/hes_starting_over____again/ "He's Starting Over – Again," ''The Boston Globe'', June 27, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Madrigal won a jury award for best stand-up comedian at the [[U.S. Comedy Arts Festival]] in [[Aspen, Colorado]]. After winning the award, he signed a talent holding deal with [[CBS]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070808113343/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000797090 "Comedy ice," ''The Hollywood Reporter'', March 1, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

Madrigal's ''[[Comedy Central Presents]]'' half-hour special premiered in July 2005. In April 2013, Madrigal’s first one-hour special, "Why Is The Rabbit Crying?," also premiered on Comedy Central. The special was named one of the top 10 comedy specials of 2013 by both ''[[Westword]]'' and ''[[The Village Voice]]'' and was praised for "deconstructing stereotypes rather than enforcing them" and "milking incongruity between expectations and reality to hilarious effect."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Graham|first1=Byron|title=Ten Best Comedy Specials of 2013|url=http://www.westword.com/arts/ten-best-comedy-specials-of-2013-5798899|website=Westword|publisher=Denver Westword, LLC|accessdate=10 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Frank|first1=Aaron|title=Top 10 Stand-Up Comedy Specials of 2013|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/music/top-10-stand-up-comedy-specials-of-2013-6593202|website=The Village Voice|publisher=Village Voice, LLC|accessdate=10 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Madrigal taped his latest stand up special, "Shrimpin' Ain't Easy" in December 2016 in the Masonic Lodge at [[Hollywood Forever Cemetery]]. Directed by [[Neal Brennan]], the special will premier on [[Showtime (TV network)|SHOWTIME]] in 2017.

In 2012, Madrigal and comedian [[Bill Burr]] founded [[All Things Comedy]], a comedy podcast network and artist cooperative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Espinoza|first1=Russ|title=New Model for a Funny Business|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/arts/2015-03-13/new-model-for-a-funny-business/|website=The Austin Chronicle|publisher=Austin Chronicle Corp.|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Madrigal and Burr started the network as a way to help comedians maintain full ownership of their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Espinoza|first1=Russ|title=New Model for a Funny Business|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/arts/2015-03-13/new-model-for-a-funny-business/|website=The Austin Chronicle|publisher=Austin Chronicle Corp.|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The network hosts over 50 podcasts and garners nearly 5 million listeners per month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McGlynn|first1=Katia|title=5 Things Comedians Can Learn from Bill Burr, Al Madrigal and the Power of All Things Comedy|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/18/all-things-comedy_n_6896750.html|website=Huffington Post|publisher=TheHuffingtonPost.com, Inc.|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[South by Southwest|South by Southwest 2015]], Madrigal, Burr, and comedian [[Doug Benson]] spoke on the “Owning Your Work: The Future of All Things Comedy” panel, where they “discussed the ins and outs of their operation and how they are working to help comics carve out their own paths in show business and avoid traditional gatekeepers.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McGlynn|first1=Katia|title=5 Things Comedians Can Learn From Bill Burr, Al Madrigal and the Power of All Things Comedy|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/18/all-things-comedy_n_6896750.html|website=The Huffington Post|publisher=TheHuffingtonPost.com, Inc.|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
