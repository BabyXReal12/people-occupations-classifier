'''Eugene Levy''', {{postnom|CM}} (born December 17, 1946) is a Canadian actor, comedian, producer, director, and writer. He is the only actor to have appeared in all eight of the ''[[American Pie (film series)|American Pie]]'' films, in his role as [[List of American Pie characters#Noah Levenstein|Noah Levenstein]]. He often plays nerdy, unconventional figures, with his humour often deriving from his excessive explanations of matters and the way in which he deals with sticky situations. Levy is a regular collaborator of actor-director [[Christopher Guest]], appearing in and co-writing four of his films, commencing with ''[[Waiting for Guffman]]'' (1997).

Levy received the [[Governor General's Performing Arts Award]], Canada's highest honour in the performing arts, in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eugene Levy biography|url=http://ggpaa.ca/award-recipients/2008/levy-eugene.aspx|publisher=Governor General's Performing Arts Awards Foundation|accessdate=February 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed to the [[Order of Canada]] on June 30, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gg.ca/document.aspx?id=14175&amp;lan=eng "Governor General Announces 50 New Appointments to the Order of Canada"], June 30, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Levy was born to a Jewish family&lt;ref name="levy"&gt;{{cite journal | last =Rosen | first =Steven | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =Want to spoof Purim and the Oscars? Be our Guest! | journal =The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles | volume =21 | issue =39 | pages = | publisher = | date =November 16, 2006 | url =http://www.jewishjournal.com/home/preview.php?id=16799 | doi = | id = | accessdate =November 16, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]], [[Ontario]]. His mother was a housewife and his father was a foreman at an automobile plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20140759,00.html|title=Ditz Hits|work=people.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went to [[Westdale Secondary School]], and attended [[McMaster University]]. He was vice-president of the McMaster Film Board, a student film group, where he met moviemaker [[Ivan Reitman]].{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

==Career==
An alumnus of both [[the Second City]], [[Toronto]] and the sketch comedy series ''[[Second City Television]]'', Levy often plays unusual supporting characters with nerdish streaks. Perhaps his best-known role on ''[[Second City Television|SCTV]]'' is the dimwitted [[Earl Camembert]], a newsanchor for the "SCTV News" and a parody of real-life Canadian newsman [[Earl Cameron (broadcaster)|Earl Cameron]]. Celebrities impersonated by Levy on SCTV include: [[Perry Como]], [[Ricardo Montalban]], [[Alex Trebek]], [[Sean Connery]], [[Howard Cosell]], [[Henry Kissinger]], [[Menachem Begin]], [[Bud Abbott]], [[Milton Berle]], [[John Charles Daly]], [[Gene Shalit]], [[Judd Hirsch]], [[Jack Carter (comedian)|Jack Carter]], [[Muammar al-Gaddafi]], [[Tony Dow]], [[James Caan (actor)|James Caan]], [[Lorne Greene]], [[Rex Reed]], Ralph Young (of [[Sandler and Young]]), [[F. Lee Bailey]], [[Ernest Borgnine]], former Ontario chief coroner Dr. Morton Schulman, [[Norman Mailer]], [[Neil Sedaka]] and [[Howard McNear]] as Floyd the Barber.

Original Levy characterizations on SCTV are comic Bobby Bittman, scandal sheet entrepreneur Dr. Raoul Withers, "report on business" naïf Brian Johns, 3-D horror auteur Woody Tobias Jr., cheerful Leutonian [[accordion]]ist Stan Schmenge, lecherous dream interpreter Raoul Wilson, hammer-voiced sports broadcaster Lou Jaffe, diminutive union patriarch Sid Dithers ("San Francisckie! Did you drove or did you flew?"), fey current-events commentator Joel Weiss, buttoned-down panel show moderator Dougal Currie, smarmy ''Just for Fun'' emcee Stan Kanter, energetic used car salesman Al Peck, guileless security guard Gus Gustofferson, Phil the Garment King (also of Phil's Nails), and the inept teen dance show host Rockin’ Mel Slirrup.

Though he has been the "above the title" star in only two films, ''[[Armed and Dangerous (1986 film)|Armed and Dangerous]]'' (1986) and ''[[The Man (2005 film)|The Man]]'' (2005), he has featured prominently in many films. He is the co-writer and frequent cast member of [[Christopher Guest]]’s mockumentary features, particularly ''[[A Mighty Wind]]'', where his sympathetic performance as emotionally unstable folksinger Mitch Cohen won kudos; his accolades included a [[Satellite Award for Best Supporting Actor - Motion Picture|Satellite Award for Best Supporting Actor - Musical or Comedy]] and the prestigious [[New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Supporting Actor]]. In the 1980s and 1990s, he appeared in ''[[Splash (film)|Splash]]'', ''[[National Lampoon's Vacation|National Lampoon’s Vacation]]'', ''[[Club Paradise]]'', ''[[Stay Tuned (film)|Stay Tuned]]'', ''[[Multiplicity (film)|Multiplicity]]'' and other comedies. Levy was the creator of ''[[Maniac Mansion (TV series)|Maniac Mansion]]'', a television sitcom based on the [[LucasArts]] [[Maniac Mansion (video game)|video game of the same name]]. He was also seriously considered for the role of [[Toby Ziegler]] on ''[[The West Wing]]'', a role that went to actor [[Richard Schiff]].

Levy, along with his son [[Dan Levy (TV personality)|Dan Levy]], is co-creator of the [[CBC Television|CBC]]/[[POP TV|PopTV]] sitcom, ''[[Schitt's Creek]]''. He also stars in the show alongside his son as head of the Rose family, Johnny Rose. His daughter, [[Sarah Levy]], portrays Twyla Sands, the waitress at the Schitt‘s Creek diner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://deadline.com/2015/01/schitts-creek-eugene-levy-son-daniel-levy-tca-1201345586/|title=Eugene Levy &amp; Son On ‘Schitt’s Creek’: "We’ll Never Know Where The Town Is" – TCA|last=D'Alessandro|first=Anthony|date=2015-01-09|newspaper=Deadline|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''American Pie'' series===
Levy's career received a tremendous boost in 1999, when he was cast as the clueless but loving dad in the blockbuster ''[[American Pie (film)|American Pie]]''. Reprising the role in three film sequels and starring in four straight-to-video sequels made him something of a cult hero. Levy has been quoted as saying the ''[[American Pie (film series)|American Pie]]'' series was a particular turning point in his career, affording him "a new perspective on his career at the time". Since working on the first two ''American Pie'' movies, Levy has worked with [[Steve Martin]] and [[Queen Latifah]] in ''[[Bringing Down the House (film)|Bringing Down the House]]'', and most recently appeared with Martin in ''[[Cheaper by the Dozen 2]]''. Levy again appeared as his famous character, Noah Levenstein, in the fourth theatrical film in the ''American Pie'' series, ''[[American Reunion]]''. He is the only actor to appear in all eight ''American Pie'' films.

==Recognition==
Levy, along with [[Christopher Guest]] and [[Michael McKean]], was awarded the 2003 [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media|Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television, or Other Visual Media]] for the title song from ''A Mighty Wind''. Levy appeared in the corner of a poster hanging outside the movie theatre in Springfield in the "[[See Homer Run]]" episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]''. (The poster was advertising for ''Princess Rock Star'' and featured a girl with an [[electric guitar]], with Levy in the corner wearing a royal crown. A liner note under him read “Eugene Levy as the King”).

In March 2006, it was announced that he would receive a star on [[Canada's Walk of Fame]]. In 2002, the entire cast of ''SCTV'' was given a group star, and although Levy is not mentioned on the actual star, he was still inducted as a part of the group. This makes him one of only four two-time honourees, alongside fellow ''SCTV'' alumni [[John Candy]], [[Martin Short]] and [[Catherine O'Hara]].

Levy is one of only a handful of people who have won at least five [[Canadian Comedy Awards]], including two for Best Writing (''[[Best in Show (film)|Best in Show]]'' in 2001 and ''[[A Mighty Wind]]'' in 2004) and three for Best Male Performer (''Best in Show'', ''[[American Pie 2]]'' in 2002, and ''A Mighty Wind'').

On May 3, 2008, the [[Governor General of Canada]] presented Levy with the Governor General’s Performing Arts Awards (GGPAA), a lifetime achievement award considered Canada's "most prestigious artistic honour".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ggpaa.ca/en/recipient.html?p_levy_e&lt;Governor General's Performing Arts Award site biography&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Levy was awarded the [[ACTRA Award]] by the [[ACTRA|union representing Canada's actors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.news957.com/entertainment/article/17025--actra-to-give-eugene-levy-award-of-excellence-in-los-angeles |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120905154018/http://www.news957.com/entertainment/article/17025--actra-to-give-eugene-levy-award-of-excellence-in-los-angeles |archivedate=September 5, 2012 |df=mdy-all }} ACTRA to give Eugene Levy Award of Excellence in Los Angeles&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Levy was made a Member of the [[Order of Canada]] "for his contributions as a comic actor and writer, and for his dedication to charitable causes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gg.ca/document.aspx?id=14175&amp;lan=eng|title=Appointments to the Order of Canada|date=June 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 22, 2012, Levy delivered a commencement address at [[Dalhousie University]], in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and was awarded the degree Doctor of Laws (honoris causa).

On June 11, 2012, Levy was presented with the [[Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal]] by the Lieutenant Governor of Ontario.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/story/2012/06/18/jubilee-gala-toronto.html| title=Diamond Jubilee Gala toasts exceptional Canadians| date=June 18, 2012| publisher=CBC| accessdate=June 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 13, 2016, Levy took home the award for "Best Performance by an Actor in a Continuing Leading Comedic Role" at the 4th Annual [[Canadian Screen Awards]], for his performance as Johnny Rose in the [[CBC Television|CBC]]/[[POP TV|PopTV]] sitcom, ''[[Schitt's Creek]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2016/03/14/canadian-screen-awards-2016_n_9456460.html|title=The Canadian Screen Awards: Call 'Em The 'Candys' From Now On|website=The Huffington Post|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

Levy married Deborah Divine in 1977 and together have two children: [[Dan Levy (TV personality)|Dan]] and [[Sarah Levy|Sarah]].

Levy is an advocate for [[autism]] awareness and treatment.&lt;ref name="CTVNews.ca"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/eugene-levy-to-be-autism-treatment-spokesman-1.244693 |title=Eugene Levy to be autism treatment spokesman |date=June 12, 2007 |website=CTVNews.ca |publisher=[[CTV Television Network]] |access-date=December 18, 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a close friend of [[John Candy]], who died of a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] in 1994.

Levy is a member of the Canadian charity Artists Against Racism. &lt;ref&gt;http://artistsagainstracism.org/artists/&lt;/ref&gt;
