== Career ==

===Early work===
Lynch spent 15 years in Chicago, acting in the [[Steppenwolf Theatre Company]] and, at the time of her audition, was one of only two women picked to join [[The Second City]] comedy troupe.&lt;ref name="guardian10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=tcea&gt;Stated on ''[[Inside the Actors Studio]]'', 2012&lt;/ref&gt; She then continued to hone her comical and [[improvisation]]al skills at [[Annoyance Theater]], playing [[Carol Brady]] in the theater's ''The Real Live Brady Bunch''.  [[Andy Richter]] played [[Mike Brady (The Brady Bunch)|Mike Brady]] in the New York shows.  He and Lynch became very good friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.hernameisjanelynch.com/2010/07/12/jane-lynchs-panel-at-outfest-now-with-video | title = Jane Lynch at Outfest | work = Her Name is Jane Lynch | date = June 12, 2010 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110504163006/http://www.hernameisjanelynch.com/2010/07/12/jane-lynchs-panel-at-outfest-now-with-video/ | archivedate = May 4, 2011 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Films===
Lynch got her start in films in 1988, playing a small role in the film ''[[Vice Versa (1988 film)|Vice Versa]]''. In 1993, she had a secondary role as a doctor alongside [[Harrison Ford]] in ''[[The Fugitive (1993 film)|The Fugitive]]''.&lt;ref name=Fugitive&gt;{{cite book|author=Lynch, Jane|title=Happy Accidents|year=2011|publisher=[[Hachette (publisher)|Hachette Books]]|page=&lt;!-- Ebook edition; page numbers not listed. --&gt;|isbn=9781401342753|quote=This was a huge deal—my first big Hollywood movie. I played Dr. Kathy Wahlund, a researcher and forensic scientist who helps Richard Kimble prove his innocence.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1990s, she made numerous [[television commercial]]s, including one for [[Frosted Flakes]] for an adult audience, directed by [[Christopher Guest]]. A few years later, Guest would remember Lynch, as he chose actors for his 2000 dog show [[mockumentary]], ''[[Best in Show (film)|Best in Show]].'' Lynch played Christy Cummings, a butch lesbian personal dog handler to trophy wife Sheri Ann Cabot ([[Jennifer Coolidge]]). From there, she became a staple actress in Guest's casts, appearing in the director's ''[[A Mighty Wind]]'' (2003) as porn actress-turned-[[folk music|folk singer]] Laurie Bohner and in ''[[For Your Consideration (film)|For Your Consideration]]'' (2006) as an entertainment reporter.

Audiences and critics took notice of Lynch for her turn in [[Judd Apatow]]'s ''[[The 40-Year-Old Virgin]].'' She told ''[[Fresh Air]]'s'' [[Terry Gross]] that the role was originally intended for a man but also that, at the urging of [[Steve Carell]]'s wife [[Nancy Walls]], was offered to Lynch instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=120086244 |title = The many roles of 'Glee' meanie Jane Lynch | work = npr.org | publisher = NPR | date = November 4, 2009 | accessdate =November 29, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From there, she took supporting roles in a series of films including ''[[Role Models]],'' ''[[Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby]],'' ''[[Alvin &amp; the Chipmunks]],'' ''[[Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story]],'' ''[[Space Chimps]],'' ''[[The Rocker (film)|The Rocker]],'' ''[[The Hammer (2007 film)|The Hammer]],'' ''[[Another Cinderella Story]],'' ''[[Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs]],'' ''[[Wreck-It Ralph]],'' and ''[[Spring Breakdown]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Toronto Sun | url = http://www.torontosun.com/entertainment/movies/2009/08/18/10493296-sun.html | title = 40 is the new 20 for Jane Lynch  | first = Kevin | last = Williamson | date = August 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Adventures of Power,'' a critically acclaimed comedy about air-drumming released in 2008, Lynch reunited with [[Michael McKean]], her former co-star from ''[[For Your Consideration (film)|For Your Consideration]],'' in the role of Aunt Joanie and starring alongside [[Ari Gold (filmmaker)|Ari Gold]], [[Adrian Grenier]], [[Chiu Chi Ling]], and [[Shoshannah Stern]]. In a role similar to that of her contributions as [[Sue Sylvester]] on the [[comedy-drama|Fox musical comedy-drama series]] ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]],'' Lynch's role as the encouraging Aunt Joanie to Power, a young musician who plays the air drums because he never had access to musical instruments, promotes the initiative to support music education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjupGPt0USQ |title=Power Saves the Music &amp; The VH1 Save the Music Foundation in Jersey City |publisher=Youtube.com |date= |accessdate=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Julie and Julia]],'' she portrayed Dorothy McWilliams, [[Julia Child]]'s sister. ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' dedicated an article on its website to the possibility of her performance receiving an [[Academy Award]] nomination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Slezak | first = Michael | url = http://popwatch.ew.com/2009/08/14/jane-lynch-julie-julia-oscar/ | title = Jane Lynch: How 'bout an Oscar nod for her work in 'Julie &amp; Julia'? |work=Entertainment Weekly | date = August 14, 2009 | accessdate =November 29, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Variety"&gt;

An autobiography written by Lynch, titled ''Happy Accidents,'' was published in the fall of 2011 by [[Hyperion Books|Hyperion Voice]].

Lynch is deaf in her right ear.
