'''Andrew Allan Clyde''' (March 25, 1892 &amp;ndash; May 18, 1967) was a Scottish-born American film and television actor whose career spanned more than four decades. In 1921 he broke into silent films as a [[Mack Sennett]] [[Comedian|comic]], debuting in "On a Summer Day". He was the fifth of six children of theatrical actor, producer and [[Stage management|manager]] John Clyde.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.helensburgh-heritage.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=713:john-clyde-scotlands-first-film-star&amp;catid=81:the-arts&amp;Itemid=458 ''John Clyde: Scotland's first film star''], Helensburgh Heritage. Retrieved 2012-01-29.&lt;/ref&gt; Clyde's brother David and his sister Jean also became screen actors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.helensburgh-heritage.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=711:david-clyde-stage-and-film-actor&amp;catid=81:the-arts&amp;Itemid=458 ''David Clyde: Stage and film actor''], Helensburgh Heritage.

Retrieved 2012-01-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Andy Clyde's movie career spanned 45 years, he may be best known for his work as California Carlson in the [[Hopalong Cassidy]] movie series. He is also known for roles in two television series: the farmer [[Cully Wilson (Lassie)|Cully Wilson]] in [[CBS]]'s ''[[Lassie (1954 TV series)|Lassie]]'' and as the neighbor George MacMichael on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[The Real McCoys]]''.

==Early years==

In 1912, Clyde first came to the United States on tour in a company performing a play called ''The Concealed Bed''. Years later, at the invitation of his close friend [[James Finlayson (actor)|James Finlayson]], he returned to the United States in 1920 to join producer Mack Sennett's roster of comedians.&lt;ref name=hht&gt;[http://www.helensburgh-heritage.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=710:andy-clyde-film-star&amp;catid=81:the-arts&amp;Itemid=458 ''Andy Clyde: Film star''], Helensburgh Heritage. Retrieved 2012-01-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Clyde's mastery of makeup allowed him tremendous versatility; he could play everything from grubby young [[guttersnipe]]s to old [[Crank (person)|crackpot]] scientists. He hit upon an "[[Old age|old man]]" characterization in his [[Short film|short]] [[Comedy film|comedies]], and the masquerade was immediately successful. Adopting a gray wig and [[Moustache|mustache]], he used this makeup for the rest of his short-subject career, and the character was so durable that he literally grew into it. He starred in short comedies longer than any other actor (32 years, 1924–56).

He made a successful transition to sound films while in Mack Sennett's employ. In 1932, when the Sennett studio was facing financial problems, Sennett cut Clyde's salary. Clyde objected and Sennett put the "old man" costume on [[character actor]] [[Irving Bacon]]. Audiences reacted adversely, and Sennett abandoned the character. [[Educational Pictures]], Sennett's distributor, took over the Andy Clyde series, which continued for two more years.

[[Columbia Pictures]] launched its [[short subject]] department in 1934 and Andy Clyde was one of the first comedy stars signed by producer [[Jules White]]. Unlike many of the Columbia short-subject comedians who indulged in broad facial and physical gestures, Clyde was subtler and more economical: his comic timing was so good that he could merely lift an eyebrow, shudder slightly, or mutter "My, my, my" for humorous effect. His work for Columbia was prolific enough that, from the mid-1940s, the studio was able to produce lower-budgeted remakes, editing older scenes into the new ones. ''[[You Were Never Uglier]]'' (1944), for example, was remade with the same principals in 1953 as ''[[Hooked and Rooked]]''. Clyde was such an audience favorite that he continued to star in Columbia shorts through 1956. He outlasted every comedian on the Columbia payroll except [[The Three Stooges]].&lt;ref name=Okuda&gt;Okuda, Ted; Watz, Edward; (1986).

Clyde also kept busy as a character actor in feature films; for example, he played a sad provincial postman in the [[Katharine Hepburn]] film ''[[The Little Minister (1934 film)|The Little Minister]]'' and [[Charles Coburn]]'s drinking buddy in ''[[The Green Years (film)|The Green Years]]''. In the 1940s, he gravitated toward outdoor and [[Western (genre)|western]] adventures. Clyde is well remembered for his roles as a comic [[sidekick]], usually teaming with [[William Boyd (actor)|William Boyd]] in the ''[[Hopalong Cassidy]]'' series, as "California Carlson" (a role he also played in the ''[[Hopalong Cassidy (radio program)|Hopalong Cassidy]]'' radio program), or with [[Whip Wilson]] in [[Monogram Pictures]]' [[Low-budget film|low-budget]] western movies.&lt;ref name=Okuda/&gt; Clyde also worked on the [[Hopalong Cassidy]] "record readers" issued by [[Capitol Records]] in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanmusicpreservation.com/Hoppy.htm#capitolrecordreaders|title=Alan Livingston and The Capitol Record Readers|last=Hall|first=Roger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Television career==

Clyde's last theatrical film was released in 1956, after which he worked mostly in television, having appeared on [[Rod Cameron (actor)|Rod Cameron]]'s [[Television syndication|syndicated]] series ''[[City Detective (TV series)|City Detective]]''. On ''[[The Pepsi-Cola Playhouse]]'' and ''[[Studio 57]]'' in 1954 and 1955, respectively, he portrayed Tom Harper in the episode "Santa's Old Suit," with co-star [[Jane Darwell]]. Clyde [[Guest appearance|guest-starred]] in several other early series too, including ''[[The People's Choice (TV series)|The People's Choice]]'', ''[[Soldiers of Fortune (TV series)|Soldiers of Fortune]]'', ''[[My Little Margie]]'', ''[[The Bob Cummings Show]]'', and ''[[Lock Up (TV series)|Lock Up]]''.&lt;ref name=imdb&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0167395/|title=Andy Clyde|publisher=[[Internet Movie Data Base]]|accessdate=December 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He appeared in two children's programs: as Colonel Jack in four episodes of ''[[Circus Boy]]'' and as Homer Tubbs in four segments of ABC's [[Western (genre)|western]] series ''[[The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin]]''.&lt;ref name=imdb/&gt;

In 1959, Clyde played Captain Gibbs in two segments of the ABC/[[Warner Brothers]] [[Westerns on television|western series]] ''[[Colt .45 (TV series)|Colt .45]]''. As "Scatterbrain Gibbs", he appeared with [[Tol Avery]] as Barnes in "Queen of Dixie"; in the story line, series character Christopher Colt ([[Wayde Preston]]) is aboard a [[Mississippi River]] gambling boat and encounters a ring of [[counterfeiting|counterfeiters]]. Clyde subsequently played "Captain Gibbs" in the episode "Yellow Terror", with [[Brad Dexter]] in the role of John Barker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050006/fullcredits#cast|title=''Colt .45''|publisher=Internet Movie Data Base|accessdate=December 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ctva.biz/US/Western/Colt45.htm|title=''Colt .45''|publisher=ctva.biz|accessdate=December 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
That same year, Clyde portrayed millionaire "Andrew C. Cooley" in the  [[CBS]] [[fantasy]] drama ''[[The Millionaire (TV series)|The Millionaire]]''.&lt;ref name=imdb/&gt;

Clyde and [[Denver Pyle]] were cast in the 1960 episode "The Man Who Wanted Everything" of the ABC western drama ''[[The Man from Blackhawk]]'', starring [[Robert Rockwell]] as a roving [[insurance investigator]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ctva.biz/US/Western/ManFromBlackhawk.htm|title=''The Man from Blackhawk''|publisher=Classic Television Archive|accessdate=January 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1960 to 1962, Clyde was cast as the farmer Pa McBeam in five episodes of the [[NBC]] western series ''[[The Tall Man (TV series)|The Tall Man]]'', starring [[Barry Sullivan (actor)|Barry Sullivan]] and [[Clu Gulager]]. [[Judy Nugent]] plays McBean's daughter, June. In three episodes, [[Olive Sturgess]] played daughter May McBeam. In "The Reluctant Bridegroom" (February 18, 1961), [[Ellen Corby]] is featured as Hannah Blossom, a potential [[mail order bride]], for Pa McBeam. Through a fraudulent letter written by the McBeam daughters, Hannah is lured to [[Lincoln, New Mexico|Lincoln]], New Mexico, the setting of the series, to seek out the potential husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0717626/|title="The Reluctant Bridegroom", February 18, 1961|publisher=Internet Movie Data Base|accessdate=February 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In "Substitute Sheriff" (January 6, 1962), the McBeam daughters enlist their father as an acting sheriff in a scheme to thwart the seizure of their property for right-of-way by the railroad.  [[Bob Hastings]] appears in this episode as J. S. Chase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0717606/|title="Substitute Sheriff", January 6, 1962|publisher=Internet Movie Data Base|accessdate=February 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962&amp;ndash;1963, Clyde portrayed Dr. Parkinson in three episodes of the NBC [[medical drama]] ''[[Dr. Kildare]]'', starring [[Richard Chamberlain]].&lt;ref name=imdb/&gt;

Clyde was featured several times on [[Rory Calhoun]]'s CBS western series ''[[The Texan (TV series)|The Texan]]'', including the part of 
Wild Jack Hastings in "The Troubled Town" and in additional segments as the character Andy Miles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ctva.biz/US/Western/Texan.htm|title=''The Texan''|publisher=Classic Television Archive|accessdate=January 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clyde further guest-starred in such westerns as ''[[Wagon Train]]'', ''[[Tales of the Texas Rangers]]'', ''[[The Restless Gun]]'', ''[[Jefferson Drum]]'', ''[[Buckskin (TV series)|Buckskin]]'', ''[[Fury (TV series)|Fury]]'', ''[[Shotgun Slade]]'', ''[[The Man from Blackhawk]]'', and ''[[The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp]]'' (as Billy Buckett).&lt;ref name=imdb/&gt;

On ''Lassie'', Clyde played the eccentric farmer and nature lover, Cully Wilson, the friend to [[Timmy Martin]], portrayed by child actor [[Jon Provost]], in much the same fashion as [[Burt Mustin]] was cast as Gus the fireman for [[Jerry Mathers]] in ''[[Leave It to Beaver]]''. In ''The Real McCoys'', Clyde performed as the foil for another veteran character actor, [[Walter Brennan]]. Clyde played friendly, usually sincere neighbor George MacMichael to Brennan's devious "Grandpa Amos McCoy". [[Madge Blake]] played Flora, the sister of George McMichael with something of a [[Love|romantic interest]] in Amos McCoy. Later, Clyde was cast as Skippy Draper in one episode of another Brennan ABC series, ''[[The Tycoon (TV series)|The Tycoon]]''.

In 1961, on CBS's ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'', Clyde played Frank Myers, an eccentric old man whom the town tries to evict in the episode "Mayberry Goes Bankrupt". Clyde portrayed Poney Thompson in "Snakebite" in 1958 and Henry Squires in "Durham Bull" in 1962 on CBS's [[List of longest-running U.S. primetime television series|long-running western series]] ''[[Gunsmoke]]''. Clyde appeared as Grandpa Jim Anderson in five episodes of the 1964–65 ABC military comedy ''[[No Time for Sergeants]]'', starring [[Sammy Jackson]]. The series was inspired by an earlier [[Andy Griffith]] [[No Time for Sergeants (1958 film)|film]] of the same name.&lt;ref name=imdb/&gt;

==Personal life==

On September 23, 1932, Clyde married Elsie Maud Tarron, a former member of the [[Sennett Bathing Beauties]],&lt;ref name=hht/&gt; in [[Ontario, California|Ontario]] in [[San Bernardino County, California|San Bernardino County]], California. [[Jules White]] recalled that Clyde became a father in middle age, and was devastated when his nine-year-old son, John Allan Clyde, died.&lt;ref&gt;David Bruskin. ''Behind the Three Stooges: The White Brothers'' {{ISBN|1-882766-00-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Clyde was close friends with [[Ben Turpin]], being the witness at Turpin's second marriage,&lt;ref name=TurpinMarriage&gt;{{cite web|title=California, County Marriages, 1850–1952, Bernard Turpin and Babette Dietz, 08 Jul 1926|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:K8NJ-524|website=FamilySearch|accessdate=25 January 2016|location=Los Angeles, United States, county courthouses, California; FHL microfilm 2,074,649.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[pallbearer]] at his funeral.&lt;ref name="“TurpinFuneral"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=XdQOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=9E8DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5449,1582309&amp;dq=ben+turpin&amp;hl=en|title=Veterans of Films Honor Ben Turpin|date=4 July 1940|publisher=Prescott Evening Courier|accessdate=23 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He became a [[naturalized United States citizen]] on September 24, 1943.&lt;ref name=Naturalization&gt;{{cite web|title=California, Southern District Court (Central) Naturalization Index, 1915–1976, Andrew Allan Clyde, 1943|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:KXQM-ZW8|website=FamilySearch|accessdate=25 January 2016|location=Los Angeles, Los Angeles, United States, National Archives and Records Service, Los Angeles Branch, Laguna Niguel; FHL microfilm 1,562,035.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clyde continued to perform on television until his death.&lt;ref name=Okuda/&gt; His remains are interred at [[Glendale, California|Glendale's]] [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Glendale|Forest Lawn Memorial Park]], near his son, John Allan and older brother, David Clyde.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}&lt;!-- WP:RS needed; removed link to WP:SPS (Twitter, FB, WP)--&gt;{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}&lt;!-- WP:RS needed; removed link to WP:SPS (Twitter, FB, WP)--&gt;{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}&lt;!-- WP:RS needed; removed link to WP:SPS (Twitter, FB, WP)--&gt;
