'''Henry Richard "Huntz" Hall''' (August 15, 1920&lt;ref name=age/&gt; &amp;ndash; January 30, 1999) was an American [[Radio programming|radio]], [[theater|theatrical]], and [[film|motion picture]] performer noted primarily for his roles in the "[[Dead End Kids]]"  movies, such as ''[[Angels with Dirty Faces]]'' (1938), which gave way to the "[[The Bowery Boys|Bowery Boys]]" movie franchise, a prolific and highly successful series of comedies in the 1940s and 1950s.

==Life and career==
Hall was born in 1920 in [[New York City, New York|New York City]]&lt;ref name=ssdi&gt;[[Social Security Death Index]]&lt;/ref&gt; to Joseph Patrick Hall, an Irish immigrant air-conditioner repairman, and his wife Mary Ellen (Mullen).&lt;ref name=age&gt;Leonard Getz in his 2006 book ''From Broadway to the Bowery'' published by [[McFarland &amp; Company]] uses August 15 but the more authoritative [[Social Security Death Index]] uses August 18, 1920. [[The Independent]] uses August 15, 1919 and the [[New York Times]] lists his age as 78 which would make his birth year 1920. Walker and Roat's biography use 1919. As with many actors, their resumes conflict with more official documents submitted to the government.&lt;/ref&gt; The 14th of 16 children, he was nicknamed "Huntz" because of his Teutonic-looking nose.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Huntz Hall|url=https://www.allmovie.com/artist/huntz-hall-p29775|publisher=[[Allmovie]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[Leonard Getz]]  |coauthors= |title=From Broadway to the Bowery |year=2006 |publisher=[[McFarland &amp; Company]] |quote= | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=luFkAAAAMAAJ&amp;q |isbn=0-7864-2535-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=independent/&gt;&lt;ref name=imdb&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0355653/ |title=Huntz Hall|publisher=[[IMDB]] |accessdate=June 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hall attended Catholic schools&lt;ref name=independent&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-huntz-hall-1068351.html|title=Huntz Hall|publisher=[[The Independent]]|date=1999-03-03|quote=Henry Richard Hall (Huntz Hall), actor: born New York 15 August 1919; married four times (one son); died Los Angeles 30 January 1999. | accessdate=May 17, 2010 | location=London | first=Tom | last=Vallance}}&lt;/ref&gt; and started performing on radio at age 5.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

He appeared on Broadway in the 1935 production of ''Dead End'', a play written and directed by [[Sidney Kingsley]].&lt;ref name=ibdb&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ibdb.com/person.php?id=43760|title=Huntz Hall|work=[[Internet Broadway Database]]|publisher=[[The Broadway League]]|accessdate=June 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hall was then cast along with the other Dead End Kids in the 1937 film ''[[Dead End (1937 film)|Dead End]]'', directed by [[William Wyler]] and starring [[Humphrey Bogart]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0028773/|title=Dead End (1937)|publisher=Internet Movie Database|accessdate=June 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hall has a cameo in the movie Yankee Doodle Dandy.

Hall also served in the [[United States Army]] during [[World War II]].  

In 1943, he appeared in the USN training film "Don't Kill your Friends" as the moronic Ensign  [[Robert_C._Osborn#World_War_II:_the_Dilbert_Years|Dilbert the Pilot]] who, because of his carelessness and cavalier attitude, manages to kill a civilian and three servicemen!
[[File:Dont Kill Your Friends.ogv|thumb|''Dilbert: Dont Kill Your Friends'', 1943]] 

In 1948, Hall was arrested for possession of marijuana, but his 1949 trial resulted in a hung jury.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-huntz-hall-1068351.html|title=Obituary: Huntz Hall | location=London | work=The Independent|first=Tom|last=Vallance|date=February 3, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hall later played the increasingly buffoonish Horace DeBussy "Sach" Jones in 48 "[[Bowery Boys]]" films, gaining top billing when his longtime partner, [[Leo Gorcey]], left the series in 1956.  Hall and Gorcey reunited in ''[[Second Fiddle to a Steel Guitar]]'' (1966) and ''[[The Phynx]]'' (1969).

He also appeared in other films, ''[[The Return of Doctor X]]'' (1939), including the war film ''[[A Walk in the Sun (1945 film)|A Walk in the Sun]]'' (1945), ''[[Gentle Ben|Gentle Giant]]'' (1967), ''[[Herbie Rides Again]]'' (1974), and ''[[The Manchu Eagle Murder Caper Mystery]]'' (1975) opposite [[Gabriel Dell]], another former ''Bowery Boy''.

In 1967, he became one of the celebrities featured on the cover of [[The Beatles]]' album ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]''.

By 1976, Hall drove  a brand-new Rolls-Royce. He did not have oil-well investments as has been erroneously reported for years all over the Internet. His son Gary Hall told biographer Jim Manago that his father made up that story for attention. 
In 1971, he co-starred along with Art Metrano, Jamie Farr and others in a sit-com on American TV, "The Chicago Teddy Bears".
His plans to produce a movie series, "The Ghetto Boys" (a take on the "[[Bowery Boys]]"), fell through. In 1973, Hall took part in Princess Grace of Monaco's Council for Drug Abuse which was part of the Catholic Office of Drug Education.&lt;ref&gt;David Ragan. "[[Who's Who in Hollywood 1900-1976]]", Arlington House, 1976, p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt;

He later appeared alongside other Hollywood veteran stars in ''[[Won Ton Ton, the Dog Who Saved Hollywood]]'' (1976), and in 1977 he played movie mogul Jesse Lasky in [[Ken Russell]]'s film ''[[Valentino (1977 film)|Valentino]].'' His later films included roles in ''[[Gas Pump Girls]]'' (1979) and ''[[The Escape Artist]]'' (1982), the latter of which reunited him again with Gabriel Dell. His final film appearance was in ''[[The Ratings Game]]'' (1984). He then performed in [[dinner theater]] productions before retiring in 1994.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;
 	
''Behind Sach: The Huntz Hall Story'' by Jim Manago, published by BearManor Media in 2015, is the first biography of Hall.

==Death==
Hall died from [[congestive heart failure]] on January 30, 1999 at the age of 78 in [[North Hollywood, California]]. He was interred in a niche at [[All Saints Episcopal Church (Pasadena, California)|All Saints Episcopal Church]] in [[Pasadena, California]].&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Michael T. Kaufman]] |coauthors= |title=Huntz Hall, Perpetual Youth In 'Bowery' Films, Dies at 78 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/02/arts/huntz-hall-perpetual-youth-in-bowery-films-dies-at-78.html |quote=Huntz Hall, who for 20 years played the slow-witted sidekick of Leo Gorcey in more than 80 ''Bowery Boys,'' ''Dead End Kids'' and ''East Side Kids'' movies, died on Saturday in Los Angeles. He was 78. The cause was cardiac disease, his family said. |work=[[New York Times]] |date=February 2, 1999 |accessdate=June 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
