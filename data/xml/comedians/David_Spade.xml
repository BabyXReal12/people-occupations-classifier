He rose to fame in the 1990s as a cast member on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', then began a successful acting career in both film and television.

==Early life==
Spade was born in [[Birmingham, Michigan]] to Judith J. (née Meek), a writer and magazine editor, and Wayne M.

Spade and his family moved to [[Scottsdale, Arizona]], when David was four years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/david-spade-9542506 |title=David Spade - Film Actor, Actor, Television Actor |date= |accessdate=2017-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents divorced soon thereafter, and he and his brothers were raised for the most part by their mother, in relative poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=David Spade |url=http://www.details.com/blogs/daily-details/2009/03/david-spade.html |work=Daily Details blog |first=Anna |last=David |date=March 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spade attended [[Saguaro High School]] and later [[Scottsdale Community College]], before transferring to [[Arizona State University]], where he earned his bachelor's degree in business in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tbs.com/stories/story/0,,115577,00.html|deadurl=yes|title=Just Shoot Me.

In the mid-80s he also did "stand up" in the Monday night comedy show at Greasy Tony's Pizza in [[Tempe, Arizona]].{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

==Career==
With the help of friend and fellow comedian [[Dennis Miller]], he joined ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in 1988. By 1990, Spade was a regular cast member as well as a writer. While there, he became known for his brand of sarcasm, and his characters in a number of [[Sketch comedy|sketches]] were hits. Some of them include a [[flight attendant]] for "[[Total Bastard Airlines]]" who bids a dismissive "Buh-Bye" to each passenger upon disembarking; a receptionist for [[Dick Clark]] who, as a matter of policy, asks people indiscriminately, "And you are?"; and the sarcastic "[[Hollywood Minute]]" reporter who puts celebrities down by means of [[one-liner joke|one-liners]].  Other characters include Christy Henderson from the [[Gap Girls]] and Karl from the Karl's Video sketches. He also did impressions of various celebrities, including [[Brad Pitt]] and [[Michael J. Fox]]. According to interviews with Spade, most of the material that he wrote early in his time at SNL was given to [[Dana Carvey]] to perform on the show. Due to his relatively low work rate, he was in danger of being fired as a performer, until the "Hollywood Minute" segment secured his position.

The most infamous moment of "Hollywood Minute" occurred in 1996 when a picture appeared on-screen of [[Eddie Murphy]], himself a former ''Saturday Night Live'' cast member and Spade exclaimed, "Look, children, it's a falling star. Make a wish!", referring to Murphy's lack of box office success at the time, most recently with the film ''[[Vampire in Brooklyn]]''. The crack led to audience boos and made Murphy upset at both Spade and ''SNL'' for years afterward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Lorne Michaels Admits Infamous SNL Eddie Murphy Crack Was a Mistake |url=http://www.mediabistro.com/fishbowlny/eddie-murphy-david-spade-hollywood-minute-saturday-night-live-lorne-michaels_b194719 |work=FishbowlNY |first=Richard |last=Horgan |date=April 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though most of the cast left in 1995, Spade stayed the following year to help in the transition with the new cast. He then quit in 1996 citing "burnout" as the reason. Said Spade, "When I leave, it will be to ease the pressure, not to be a movie star. You can't stay there forever – it kills you inside. It ages you in dog years. It's a tough place." He returned to host an episode in 1998 and another in 2005.

Spade's film career was successful. He appeared with fellow ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' cast member and friend [[Chris Farley]] in two [[buddy comedy]] films, ''[[Tommy Boy]]'' (1995) and ''[[Black Sheep (1996 film)|Black Sheep]]'' (1996). The two were planning a third film together when Farley died of a drug overdose in 1997 at the age of 33. When Spade declined to attend Farley's funeral, rumors abounded that there was a falling out between the two. Spade admitted that their friendship had been strained partly because of Farley's drug problem, but stated that the reason he did not attend the funeral was simply that he could not handle it emotionally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Grow|first1=Kory|title=David Spade Explains Why He Didn't Attend Chris Farley's Funeral|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/david-spade-explains-why-he-didnt-attend-chris-farleys-funeral-20140430|website=Rolling Stone|accessdate=24 February 2018|date=April 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he received several offers to star in his own TV shows, he turned them down and joined the ensemble cast of [[Steven Levitan]]'s office sitcom ''[[Just Shoot Me!]],'' opposite [[Laura San Giacomo]] and [[George Segal]], which ran for seven seasons from 1997 to 2003. He played a sarcastic receptionist, [[Dennis Finch]].

While appearing on ''Just Shoot Me'', Spade had his first solo starring role as the title character in the 2001 film ''[[Joe Dirt]]'', which was a modest box office success. The film was co-written by Spade and Fred Wolf.

Spade starred again in the 2003 film ''[[Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star]]'', again co-written by Spade and Wolf. It was the first of many films in which Spade has appeared that were produced by another ''Saturday Night Live'' castmate, [[Adam Sandler]]. Most notable among these are the films ''[[Grown Ups (film)|Grown Ups]]'' (2010) and ''[[Grown Ups 2]]'' (2013), both of which included Spade and Sandler among the lead roles, and both of which were major box office hits.

Spade hosted both the [[Teen Choice Awards]] and [[SpikeTV]]'s [[Spike Video Game Awards|Video Game Awards]] in 2003. He voiced characters on several episodes of ''[[Beavis and Butt-head]]'' and produced his own TV series ''[[Sammy (TV series)|Sammy]]'' in 2000. From 2002 to 2006, Spade regularly appeared in commercials for [[Capital One]] (with [[Nate Torrence]]) where he played the employee of a fictional rival company whose policy toward honoring credit card rewards (and just about everything else) is "always no." In 2004, he joined the cast of ''[[8 Simple Rules]],'' following the death of the sitcom's star, [[John Ritter]], for the show's third and final season.

He hosted the Comedy Central TV show ''[[The Showbiz Show with David Spade]]'' for three seasons, from September 2005 to October 2007. On the show, Spade made fun of Hollywood and celebrities in a manner similar to his old "Hollywood Minute" segment on ''SNL''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvseriesfinale.com/2007/10/the_showbiz_show_with_david_spade_comedy_central_s.php The Showbiz Show with David Spade: Comedy Central Series Cancelled] {{dead link|date=July 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}, ''TVSeriesFinale.com''. October 7, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Spade was one of the voice talents for the 2006 video game ''[[The Legend of Spyro: A New Beginning]]''. He provided the voice of Spyro's dragonfly companion, [[Spyro the Dragon (character)#Sparx|Sparx]].&lt;ref&gt;FX TV channel&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2007 to 2013, Spade starred as Russell Dunbar in the ensemble [[Columbia Broadcasting System|CBS]] sitcom ''[[Rules of Engagement (TV series)|Rules of Engagement]]''.

In 2010, he worked with [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] on a pilot for an animated series based on ''Joe Dirt'', but it was eventually dropped.&lt;ref name="The Live Feed"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thrfeed.com/2010/01/david-spade-tbs-plotting-animated-version-of-joe-dirt.html|title=David Spade, TBS plotting animated 'Joe Dirt' |publisher = The Live Feed|date=Jan 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Spade had a guest role on an episode of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] sitcom [[The Goldbergs (2013 TV series)|''The Goldbergs'']] (on which George Segal has a major role as "Pops", the protagonist's grandfather). The end credits featured an interaction between Pops and Spade's character.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ew.com/article/2014/09/10/david-spade-the-goldbergs-2/|title=First look: David Spade guest stars on the premiere of 'The Goldbergs'|date=2014-09-10|work=EW.com|access-date=2017-05-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and honors==
Spade received an [[Emmy]] nomination and two [[Golden Globe]] nominations for his role as Dennis Finch on ''Just Shoot Me!''.

On September 5, 2003, Spade received a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].

==Personal life==
Spade has dated numerous actresses and celebrities, including [[Heather Locklear]], [[Julie Bowen]], [[Teri Hatcher]], and [[Naya Rivera]],&lt;ref name=Moehringer&gt;{{cite news|last1=Moehringer|first1=J.
