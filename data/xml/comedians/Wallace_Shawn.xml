His film roles have included those of Wally Shawn in the [[Louis Malle]] directed comedy-drama ''[[My Dinner with Andre]]'' (1981), Vizzini in ''[[The Princess Bride (film)|The Princess Bride]]'' (1987), Mr. James Hall in ''[[Clueless (film)|Clueless]]'' (1995) and providing the voice of [[List of Toy Story characters#Rex|Rex]] in the [[Toy Story (franchise)|''Toy Story'' franchise]]. He has also appeared in a variety of television series, including recurring roles as [[Grand Nagus Zek]] in ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' (1993–1999) and Cyrus Rose in ''[[Gossip Girl]]'' (2008–2012).

His plays include [[Obie Award]] winning ''[[Aunt Dan and Lemon]]'' (1985), ''[[The Designated Mourner]]'' (1996) and ''Grasses of a Thousand Colors'' (2008). He also co-wrote the screenplay for ''My Dinner with Andre'' with [[Andre Gregory]], and he scripted ''[[A Master Builder]]'' (2013), a film adaptation of the play by [[Henrik Ibsen]], which he also starred in.&lt;ref name="archrecord.construction.com"/&gt; His book ''Essays'' was published in 2009 by Haymarket Books.

==Early life==
Shawn was born in [[New York City]], to a [[Jewish]] family.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tabletmag.com/jewish-arts-and-culture/15038/bag-of-tricks|title=Bag of Tricks|work=Tablet Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejc.com/arts/arts-interviews/13688/interview-wallace-shawn|title=Interview: Wallace Shawn|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.juf.org/tweens/celebrity.aspx?id=10902|title=JUF : Tweens : Celebrities : Wallace Shawn|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jewishvoiceforpeace.org/content/advisory-board|title=Councils, Staff and Board of Jewish Voice for Peace|work=Jewish Voice for Peace}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents are [[William Shawn]] (1907–1992), the long-time editor of ''[[The New Yorker]]'', and journalist Cecille Shawn ([[married and maiden names|née]] Lyon; 1906–2005); his brother, [[Allen Shawn|Allen]], is a [[composer]].&lt;ref name="musicference3"&gt;see pg. 20 of liner notes accompanying "Allen Shawn – Piano Works" CD issued by Coviello Classics label (COV 91414)&gt; {{cite web|url=http://www.covielloclassics.de/index.php/katalog/search/allen%20shawn.html|title=Allen Shawn - Klavierwerke|last=|first=|date=|website=Music Reference|accessdate=February 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shawn attended [[The Putney School]], a private liberal arts high school in [[Putney, Vermont]], and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in history from [[Harvard College]]. He studied philosophy, politics and economics, as well as Latin, at [[Magdalen College, Oxford]], originally intending to become a diplomat. He also traveled to India as an English teacher, on a [[Fulbright Scholarship|Fulbright]] program. He then taught Latin in Manhattan but, since 1979, has made a living primarily as an actor.

==Career==

===Playwright===
Shawn's early plays, such as ''[[Marie and Bruce]]'' (1978), portrayed emotional and sexual conflicts in an [[Theatre of the Absurd|absurdist]] style, with language that was both lyrical and violent. In a conversation with [[Andre Gregory]], parts of which were used to create ''[[My Dinner with Andre]]'', Shawn referred to these plays as depicting "my interior life as a raging beast." Critical response was extremely polarized: some critics hailed Shawn as a major writer, while [[John Simon (critic)|John Simon]] called ''Marie and Bruce'' "garbage" and described Shawn as "one of the unsightliest actors in this city."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://theater.nytimes.com/2011/04/06/theater/reviews/in-marie-and-bruce-wallace-shawn-paints-misery-review.html |title=There's Room for Everyone Aboard a Marital Misery Tour |first=Ben |last=Brantley |date=April 5, 2011 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=January 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His 1977 play ''A Thought in Three Parts'' caused controversy in [[London]] when the production was investigated by a [[vice squad]] and attacked in Parliament after allegations of [[pornography|pornographic]] content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whistlerinthedark.com/productions/DanandLemon.html |title=Aunt Dan and Lemon |website=Whistler in the Dark |date=2011 |accessdate=July 29, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323133414/http://www.whistlerinthedark.com/productions/DanandLemon.html |archivedate=March 23, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also awarded the [[Obie Award]] for best playwrighting in 1974 for his play ''Our Late Night''.&lt;ref&gt;Obie Awards [http://www.obieawards.com/events/1970s/year-74/ "1974 Winners"]&lt;/ref&gt;

His later plays became more overtly political, drawing parallels between the psychology of his characters and the behavior of governments and social classes. Among the best-known of these are ''[[Aunt Dan and Lemon]]'' (1985) and ''[[The Designated Mourner]]'' (1997). Shawn's political work has invited controversy, as he often presents the audience with several contradictory points of view, such as ''Aunt Dan and Lemon'', which Shawn described as a cautionary tale against [[fascism]]. The monologue ''The Fever'', originally created by Shawn to be performed for small audiences in apartments, describes a person who becomes sick while struggling to find a morally consistent way to live when faced with injustice, and harshly criticizes the record of the United States in supporting oppressive [[anti-communism|anti-communist]] regimes. In 1997, Shawn discussed the political nature of ''Aunt Dan and Lemon'', ''The Fever'' and ''The Designated Mourner'' in an interview in which he talked extensively about the thematic developments between the three plays, as well as his own views on [[Marxism|Marxist]], [[Communism|communist]] and [[socialism|socialist]] politics, their relevance to [[American liberalism]], and how government and individual responsibilities for finding solutions to the dichotomy between rich and poor in the world take hold in the characters presented in his plays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=McGrath |first=Patrick |url=http://bombsite.com/issues/59/articles/2063 |title=Wallace Shawn by Patrick McGrath |website=BOMB Magazine |date=Spring 1997 |accessdate=July 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Aunt Dan and Lemon'' earned Shawn his second Obie Award for excellence in playwrighting in 1986,&lt;ref&gt;Obie Awards [http://www.obieawards.com/events/1980s/year-86/ "1986 Winners"]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Fever'' won Best American Play in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Obie Awards, [http://www.obieawards.com/events/1990s/year-91/ "1991 Winners"]&lt;/ref&gt; Shawn's four plays have been adapted into films: ''The Designated Mourner'' (basically a film version of [[David Hare (dramatist)|David Hare]]'s stage production), ''Marie and Bruce'', ''My Dinner with Andre'' and ''The Fever''. [[Academy Award|Oscar]] winner [[Vanessa Redgrave]] stars in ''[[The Fever (2004 film)|The Fever]]'' (2004),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/review-television-fever-dc-idUSN1230003820070612 |title=Redgrave laid low by HBO's heavy "Fever" |website=[[Reuters]] |date=June 12, 2007 |first=Ray |last=Richmond |accessdate=January 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which first aired on [[HBO]] on June 13, 2007.

Shawn has also written political commentary for ''[[The Nation (U.S. periodical)|The Nation]]'', and in 2004 he published the one-issue-only progressive political magazine ''Final Edition'', which featured interviews with and articles by [[Jonathan Schell]], [[Noam Chomsky]], [[Mark Strand]] and [[Deborah Eisenberg]]. Shawn is credited as translator of [[Bertolt Brecht]]'s ''[[The Threepenny Opera]]'', which opened at [[Studio 54]] in [[Manhattan]] on March 25, 2006. He appears briefly in voice-over during "Song about the Futility of Human Endeavor". He published his first nonfiction work, ''Essays'', on September 1, 2009. It is a collection of essays that expresses his perceptions of politics and other subjects that reflect an aspect of his life.

===Acting===
Shawn's involvement with theater began in 1970 when he met [[Andre Gregory]], who has since directed several of his plays. As a stage actor, he has appeared mostly in his own plays and other projects with Gregory. He made his film debut in 1979, playing [[Diane Keaton]]'s former husband in [[Woody Allen]]'s ''[[Manhattan (film)|Manhattan]]'' and an insurance agent in [[Bob Fosse]]'s ''[[All That Jazz (film)|All That Jazz]]''. His best-known film roles include Earl in ''[[Strange Invaders]]'' (1983) and Mr. Hall in ''[[Clueless (film)|Clueless]]'' (1995). After seeing his performance in ''[[My Dinner With Andre]]'' (1981), casting director Janet Hirshenson was so fond of his delivery of the word "inconceivable" that she cast him as Vizzini in ''[[The Princess Bride (film)|The Princess Bride]]'' (1987). Other roles include Baron Von Westphalen in ''[[Southland Tales]]'', on ''[[Gossip Girl]]'' as Cyrus Rose, and in ''[[The Haunted Mansion (film)|The Haunted Mansion]]'' (2003) as Ezra.

His rare non-comedic film roles include two collaborations with [[Andre Gregory]] and [[Louis Malle]]: the semi-autobiographical dialogue ''[[My Dinner with Andre]]'', and a combined production-and-backstage-drama of ''[[Uncle Vanya]]'' titled ''[[Vanya on 42nd Street]]''. Shawn quite often appears on television, where he has appeared in many genres and series. He has had recurring roles as the [[Grand Nagus Zek]] in ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'', Stuart Best in ''[[Murphy Brown]]'', Jeff Engels in ''[[The Cosby Show]]'', Dr. Howard Stiles in ''[[Crossing Jordan]]'', Arnie Ross in ''[[Taxi (TV series)|Taxi]]'', Charles Lester in ''[[The Good Wife]]'', and a reprisal of his role as Mr. Hall in ''[[Clueless (TV series)|Clueless]]'' (based on the film). He appeared in the 1985 music video for [[Chaka Khan]]'s "This is My Night". On February 4, 2010, Shawn appeared as Alan Rubin in ''[[The Daily Show with Jon Stewart]]''. He appeared in ''[[Vegas Vacation]]'' (1997) as Marty. One of Shawn's latest films opened in his birthplace in [[New York City|New York]] in June 2014 titled ''[[A Master Builder]]''.&lt;ref name="archrecord.construction.com"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shawn was honored in 2005 with the [[PEN/Laura Pels International Foundation for Theater Award]] as a Master American Dramatist.

=== Voice acting ===
Shawn is also a voice actor for animated films and television series, including [[List of Toy Story characters#Rex|Rex]] in the [[Toy Story (franchise)|''Toy Story'' franchise]], [[List of The Incredibles characters#Gilbert Huph|Mr. Gilbert Huph]] in ''[[The Incredibles]]'', Principal Mazur in ''[[A Goofy Movie]]'', [[Bertram (Family Guy)|Bertram]] in ''[[Family Guy]]'', Munk in ''[[Happily N'Ever After]]'', Purple Pirate Paul in [[Tom and Jerry: Shiver Me Whiskers]], and as a caricature of himself in ''[[BoJack Horseman]]''.

In ''[[The Fox and the Hound]]'', he was originally going to voice ''Boomer'', but dropped out and was replaced by [[Paul Winchell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ohmy.disney.com/movies/2015/06/18/we-bet-you-didnt-know-these-actors-voice-characters-in-both-disney-and-disneypixar-movies/|title=We Bet You Didn’t Know These Actors Voice Characters in Both Disney and Disney Pixar Movies|date=2015-06-19|work=Oh My Disney|access-date=2017-09-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Cats &amp; Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore]]'', Shawn replaced [[Jon Lovitz]] as the voice of [[List of Cats &amp; Dogs characters#Calico|Calico]]. Coincidentally, Lovitz and Shawn both appeared in ''[[I Could Never Be Your Woman]]''.

==Personal life==
In June 2013, Shawn and numerous other celebrities appeared in a video showing support for [[Chelsea Manning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.politico.com/story/2013/06/celebrity-bradley-manning-video-93041.html#ixzz2WgfpNmys |title=Celeb video: ‘I am Bradley Manning’ |first=Patrick |last=Gavin |website=[[Politico]] |date=June 20, 2013 |accessdate=July 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has referred to himself as a [[socialist]] in an essay titled ''Why I Call Myself a Socialist: Is the World Really a Stage?'', which was published online and later in a nonfiction collection titled ''Essays''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |website=[[Huffington Post]] |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/wallace-shawn/why-i-call-myself-a-socia_b_818061.html |title=Why I Call Myself a Socialist: Is the World Really a Stage? |date=February 3, 2011 |accessdate=January 5, 2017 |first=Wallace |last=Shawn}}&lt;/ref&gt;
