'''Kevin Hamilton McDonald''' (born May 16, 1961) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] actor, voice actor and comedian. He is known as a member of ''[[The Kids in the Hall]]'', the voice of [[List of Lilo &amp; Stitch characters#Pleakley|Agent Pleakley]] in the [[Lilo &amp; Stitch (franchise)|''Lilo &amp; Stitch'' franchise]], Waffle in ''[[Catscratch]]'', Pastor Dave in ''[[That 70s Show]]'', and the Almighty Tallest Purple in ''[[Invader Zim]]''. Kevin also stars as a co-pilot in the 2011 web comedy series ''[[Papillon (TV series)|Papillon]]''.

==Early life==
McDonald was born in [[Montréal]], [[Québec]], the son of Sheila and Hamilton McDonald, who was a dental equipment salesman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/18/Kevin-McDonald.html|title=Kevin McDonald Biography (1961-)|website=www.filmreference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He moved to [[Los Angeles, California]] at the age of seven, after his father was transferred there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kithfan.org/kith/kevin.html|title=KITHfan.org : Kids in the Hall : Kevin McDonald|website=www.kithfan.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; His family subsequently lived in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]] as well. McDonald has a younger sister, Sandra.

During an interview on ''[[WTF with Marc Maron]]'', McDonald discussed his father, Hamilton "Hammy" McDonald's severe alcoholism, which inspired the memorable ''Kids In The Hall'' sketches "Daddy Drank" and "Girl Drink Drunk." Although he calls his mother "a wonderful woman," she was nevertheless reluctant to leave him until Kevin turned 19, when his father's drinking had escalated to two bottles of vodka daily. McDonald, his mother and sister rented an apartment, where they quietly moved their belongings "every night [after his father would] collapse on the stairs." Once they had completely moved, his parents divorced, his father lost his job, went bankrupt and lived in a homeless shelter for a year, during which he abstained from drinking (although he alleged "his roommates were drinking Drano"); coincidentally, Kevin McDonald would use the same building to rehearse with ''The Kids In The Hall'' as they were starting out on stage. His father was able to find employment at a flower shop, then an apartment and, over time, resume his career in dental equipment sales. Eventually, he did drink again, but not to the extent he had earlier in his life and died of an aneurysm in 2004.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TE-vR-bHI7Q|title=WTF with Marc Maron Podcast Episode 477 Kevin Macdonald / Kevin McDonald|first=|last=Freddie Hodges|date=19 October 2014|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kevin McDonald would use his relationship with his father as the basis for a one-man show, "Hammy And The Kids", in which he said he had no happy ending to the story of his father;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hipstercrite.com/2010/09/06/hammy-and-the-kids/|title=Hammy and the Kids|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but, during his interview with [[Marc Maron]], he said after one performance of his one-man show, he was approached by a stranger who said that he had served his father as a bartender, and that his father mentioned how proud he was of his son, the famous comedian, which moved McDonald to tears "like [it was] the ending to a bad movie."

McDonald briefly studied acting at a community college, where he was kicked out for being "a one-legged actor" (i.e. he could perform comedy, but not drama) by a dean who had a leg amputated, and was therefore a literal one-legged actor. However, [[William B. Davis]], who would later find fame in his portrayal of [[Cigarette Smoking Man]] on ''[[The X-Files]]'', was one of his professors, saw McDonald's potential and encouraged him to pursue improv comedy by giving him the number to Second City in Toronto.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

During his youth, he had a weight problem. It wasn't until just prior to ''The Kids in the Hall'' in the late 1980s that he went from overweight to rather skinny. Several sketches and monologues allude to the issue, and a stockier McDonald can be seen in archival footage on ''The Kids in the Hall'' on [[DVD]] [[box sets]].

==Career==
McDonald founded ''[[The Kids in the Hall]]'' with his friend [[Dave Foley]]. They met in [[Toronto]] at the [[Second City Training Center]], and the two wrote and performed in sketches together more than any other pair in the group. In the troupe's TV show and stage shows, he portrays several popular recurring characters, such as the King of Empty Promises, Sir Simon Milligan, and Jerry Sizzler. Still, it's a frequent running gag that McDonald is the least popular member and always struggling not to get kicked out.

Since ''The Kids in the Hall'''s end in 1994, he's played many roles in movies like ''[[Boy Meets Girl (1998 film)|Boy Meets Girl]]'', [[Agent Pleakley]] in the [[Lilo &amp; Stitch (franchise)|''Lilo &amp; Stitch'' franchise]], and [[Harry Potter]] in ''[[Epic Movie]]''. On [[television]], he has appeared on ''[[The Martin Short Show]]'', ''[[Ellen (TV series)|Ellen]]'' (as a radio personality), ''[[That '70s Show]]'' (as a confused young cleric, Pastor Dave), ''[[Seinfeld]]'', ''[[Friends]]'', ''[[NewsRadio]]'' (on which Foley starred), ''[[MADtv]]'', ''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]]'', and ''[[Corner Gas]]''. McDonald has also done voice work for various animated series, including ''[[Invader Zim]]'' (in which he did the voice for Almighty Tallest Purple), ''[[The Angry Beavers]]'', ''[[Catscratch]]'' (in which he voiced Waffle), and ''[[Clerks: The Animated Series]]''. He also played an [[imaginary friend]] named Ivan in the ''[[Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends]]'' episode ''Sight For Sore Eyes'', and appeared in the music video for "Roses" by [[OutKast]].

In 2006, McDonald hosted a [[CBC Television]] special, featuring several of Canada's best-known sketch comedy troupes. "Sketch with Kevin McDonald" won a [[Canadian Comedy Award]] (Best Taped Live Performance - [[The Minnesota Wrecking Crew]]), with "[[The Imponderables]]" nominated for the same award.

He participated in [[Montréal]]'s 2007 Just for Laughs Festival with the reunion of ''The Kids in the Hall'', and also with his show "Hammy and the Kids" with [[Craig Northey]], based on his two [[dysfunctional family|dysfunctional]] families, his father ("Hammy") and ''The Kids in the Hall''.
