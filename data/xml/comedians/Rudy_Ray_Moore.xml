'''Rudolph Frank Moore''' (March 17, 1927{{spaced ndash}}October 19, 2008), known as '''Rudy Ray Moore''', was an American comedian, musician, singer, film actor, and film producer.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/22/movies/22moore.html?_r=0  Douglas Martin, "Rudy Ray Moore, 81, a Precursor of Rap, Dies", ''NY Times'', 22 October 2008]. Retrieved February 23, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; He was perhaps best known as Dolemite (the name derived from the mineral [[dolomite]]),&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=YgyZfOmg9EkC&amp;pg=PA97&amp;dq=dolemite+dolomite&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjZguv7uOjNAhXmB8AKHei1DDsQ6AEINzAE#v=onepage&amp;q=dolemite%20dolomite&amp;f=false  Jim Dawson, ''The Compleat Motherfucker: A History of the Mother of All Dirty Words'', 2011, p.97]&lt;/ref&gt; the uniquely articulate [[pimp]] from the 1975 film ''[[Dolemite]]'', and its sequels, ''[[The Human Tornado]]'' and ''[[The Return of Dolemite]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1453163/dolemite-dirty-old-man.jhtml MTV]&lt;/ref&gt; The persona was developed during his earlier comedy records,&lt;ref name=ALLMUSIC&gt;[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p206/biography|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic Biography by Cub Koda].

Retrieved February 23, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; for which Moore has been called "the Godfather of Rap".&lt;ref name=chicago/&gt;

==Biography==
Moore was born and raised in [[Fort Smith, Arkansas]], and eventually moved to [[Cleveland, Ohio]], and then [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]]. In Milwaukee, he preached in churches and worked as a [[nightclub]] dancer.&lt;ref name=dootsie&gt;[http://www.shockingimages.com/dolemite/albums/belowthebelt.php  Dootsie Williams, Liner notes for ''Below The Belt'']. Retrieved February 23, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to Cleveland, working in clubs as a singer, dancer, and comedian, often appearing in character as '''Prince DuMarr'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/ohio/obituary.aspx?pid=119140285  Obituary, Rudolph Frank "Rudy Ray Moore" Moore, 21 October 2008]. Retrieved February 23, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the [[US Army]] and served in an entertainment unit in Germany, where he was nicknamed the Harlem Hillbilly for singing [[country music|country]] songs in [[R&amp;B]] style.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; He developed an interest in comedy in the Army after expanding on a singing performance for other servicemen.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;[http://www.shockingimages.com/dolemite/biography.php  Biography by Mark Jason Murray at Rudy Ray Moore website]. Retrieved February 23, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

After his discharge he lived in [[Seattle, Washington]] and then [[Los Angeles]], where he continued to work in clubs and was discovered by record producer [[Dootsie Williams]].&lt;ref name=dootsie/&gt; He recorded [[rhythm and blues]] songs for the [[Federal Records|Federal]], [[Cash Records|Cash]], [[Ball Records|Ball]], [[Kent Records|Kent]] and [[Imperial Records|Imperial]] labels between 1955 and 1962, and released his first comedy albums, ''Below the Belt'' (1959), ''The Beatnik Scene'' (1962), and ''A Comedian Is Born'' (1964).&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://koti.mbnet.fi/wdd/rudyraymoore.htm  Discography at WangDangDula.com]. Retrieved February 23, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

By his own account, he was working at a record store in Hollywood in 1970 when he began hearing obscene stories of "Dolemite" recounted by a local man named Rico.  Moore began recording the stories, and assumed the role of "Dolemite" in his club act and on recordings.&lt;ref name=latimes&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2008/oct/21/local/me-moore21  Jocelyn Y Stewart, "Obituary: Rudy Ray Moore", ''Los Angeles Times'', 21 October 2008]. Retrieved February 23, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970–71 he recorded three albums of material, ''Eat Out More Often'', ''This Pussy Belongs To Me'', and ''The Dirty Dozens'', where "with jazz and R&amp;B musicians playing in the background, [Moore] would recite raunchy, sexually explicit rhymes that often had to do with [[pimps]], prostitutes, players, and hustlers."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allmusic.com/album/this-pussy-belongs-to-me-mw0000094218  Alex Henderson, Review of ''This Pussy Belongs To Me'' at Allmusic.com]. Retrieved February 23, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Moore was influenced by more mainstream comedians such as [[Redd Foxx]] and [[Richard Pryor]], as well as by traditions such as [[the Dozens]].  The recordings were usually made in Moore's own house, with friends in attendance to give a party atmosphere.  The album covers and contents were often too racy to be put on display in record stores,&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt; but the records became popular through word of mouth and were highly successful in disadvantaged black American communities,&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; where his "warped wit and anti-establishment outlook" were embraced.&lt;ref name=chicago/&gt;

Moore spent most of his earnings from the records to finance the movie ''[[Dolemite]]'', which appeared in 1975 and has been described as "one of the great [[blaxploitation]] movies" of the 1970s.&lt;ref name=ALLMUSIC/&gt;&lt;ref name=chicago/&gt; The character was "the ultimate ghetto hero: a bad dude, profane, skilled at kung-fu, dressed to kill and hell-bent on protecting the community from evil menaces. He was a pimp with a kung-fu-fighting clique of prostitutes and he was known for his sexual prowess."&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt;

The film was successful and was followed by ''[[The Human Tornado]]'', ''[[The Monkey Hustle]]'', and ''[[Petey Wheatstraw (film)|Petey Wheatstraw: The Devil's Son-in-Law]]''.  Moore continued to release albums that appealed to his enduring fanbase through the 1970s and 1980s, but little of his work reached the mainstream white audience.  His "rapid-fire rhyming salaciousness exceeded the wildest excesses" of Foxx and Pryor,&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; and his highly explicit style kept him off television and major films.&lt;ref name="ALLMUSIC" /&gt;&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt; At the same time, Moore often spoke in his church and regularly took his mother to the [[National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc.|National Baptist Convention]].  He said that: "I wasn't saying dirty words just to say them...  It was a form of art, sketches in which I developed ghetto characters who cursed. I don't want to be referred to as a dirty old man, rather a ghetto expressionist."&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt;

He came to be regarded as a major influence by many later [[rapping|rap]] stars. [[Snoop Dogg]] said: "Without Rudy Ray Moore, there would be no Snoop Dogg, and that's for real."&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;   Moore appeared on [[Big Daddy Kane]]'s 1990 album ''[[Taste of Chocolate]]'' and [[2 Live Crew]]'s 1994 album ''[[Back at Your Ass for the Nine-4]]''. On an episode of ''[[Martin (TV series)|Martin]]'' titled "The Players Came Home," he appeared as himself in the Dolemite character. He also reprised his Dolemite character in an appearance on Snoop Dogg's 1999 album ''[[No Limit Top Dogg]]'' and [[Busta Rhymes]]' ''[[When Disaster Strikes...]]'' and ''[[Genesis (Busta Rhymes album)|Genesis]]''.

In 2000, Moore starred in ''[[Big Money Hustlas]]'', a movie created by and starring the hip hop group [[Insane Clown Posse]], in which he played Dolemite for the first time in over 20 years.  In 2006, Moore voice acted in the show ''[[Sons of Butcher (TV series)|Sons of Butcher]]'', as Rudy in season 2.  In 2008, he reprised the character [[Petey Wheatstraw (film)|Petey Wheatstraw]] on the song "I Live for the Funk," which featured [[Blowfly (musician)|Blowfly]] and Daniel Jordan. This marked the first time Blowfly and Rudy collaborated on the same record together—and the 30-year anniversary of the movie ''Petey Wheatstraw'' and was also the final recording Rudy made before his death.&lt;ref name="I Live 4 The Funk - Analog Medium"&gt;[http://blog.analogmedium.com/2008/04/i-live-4-funk-by-daniel-jordan.html I Live 4 The Funk – Analog Medium]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
On October 19, 2008, Moore died in [[Akron, Ohio]], of complications from [[diabetes]]. He was never married; his mother, two brothers and one sister, daughter and grandchildren survived him.&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt;

On June 7, 2018, it was announced that [[Craig Brewer]] would direct ''Dolemite Is My Name'' from a script by [[Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski]] with [[Netflix]] producing and distributing. [[Eddie Murphy]] was set to star as Moore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Galuppo|first1=Mia|title=Eddie Murphy to Star as Rudy Ray Moore for Netflix|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/eddie-murphy-star-as-rudy-ray-moore-netflix-movie-1118159|website=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=June 7, 2018|language=en|date=June 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://variety.com/2018/film/news/eddie-murphy-dolemite-is-my-name-netflix-1202837013/ Film News Roundup: Eddie Murphy to Star in Biopic ‘Dolemite Is My Name’ for Netflix]&lt;/ref&gt; Later that month, the rest of the principal cast was announced.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/wesley-snipes-joins-eddie-murphy-netflixs-rudy-ray-moore-movie-1120125 Wesley Snipes Joins Eddie Murphy in Netflix's 'Dolemite Is My Name!'
