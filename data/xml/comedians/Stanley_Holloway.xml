[[File:Stanley Holloway.jpg|thumb|right|Stanley Holloway in 1974]]
'''Stanley Augustus Holloway''', [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] (1 October 1890&amp;nbsp;– 30 January 1982) was an English stage and film actor, humourist, singer, poet and [[monologist]]. He was famous for his comic and character roles [[Stanley Holloway on stage and screen|on stage and screen]], especially that of Alfred P. Doolittle in ''[[My Fair Lady]]''. He was also renowned for his [[Songs and monologues of Stanley Holloway|comic monologues and songs]], which he performed and recorded throughout most of his 70-year career.

Born in London, Holloway pursued a career as a clerk in his teen years. He made early stage appearances before infantry service in the First World War, after which he had his first major theatre success starring in ''[[Kissing Time]]'' when the musical transferred to the [[West End theatre|West End]] from [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]].  In 1921, he joined a [[Concert party (entertainment)|concert party]], ''[[The Co-Optimists]]'', and his career began to flourish. At first, he was employed chiefly as a singer, but his skills as an actor and reciter of comic monologues were soon recognised.  Characters from his monologues such as Sam Small, invented by Holloway, and Albert Ramsbottom, created for him by [[Marriott Edgar]], were absorbed into popular British culture, and Holloway developed a following for the recordings of his many monologues. By the 1930s, he was in demand to star in [[variety show|variety]], [[pantomime]] and musical comedy, including several [[revue]]s.

Following the outbreak of the Second World War, Holloway made short propaganda films on behalf of the [[British Film Institute]] and [[Pathé News]] and took character parts in a series of war films including ''[[Major Barbara (film)|Major Barbara]]'', ''[[The Way Ahead]]'', ''[[This Happy Breed (film)|This Happy Breed]]'' and ''[[The Way to the Stars]]''. After the war, he appeared in the film ''[[Brief Encounter]]'' and made a series of films for Ealing Studios, including ''[[Passport to Pimlico]]'', ''[[The Lavender Hill Mob]]'' and ''[[The Titfield Thunderbolt]]''.

In 1956 he was cast as the irresponsible and irrepressible Alfred P. Doolittle in ''My Fair Lady'', a role that he played on Broadway, the West End and in the [[My Fair Lady (film)|film version in 1964]]. The role brought him international fame, and his performances earned him nominations for a [[Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Musical]] and an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]].  In his later years, Holloway appeared in television series in the UK and the US, toured in revues, appeared in stage plays in Britain, Canada, Australia and the US, and continued to make films into his eighties. Holloway was married twice and had five children, including the actor [[Julian Holloway]].

===Career===
{{further| Stanley Holloway on stage and screen}}

====Early career and First World War====
[[File:Kissing-time-12.jpg|thumb|right|[[Leslie Henson]], Holloway's early mentor, with [[Phyllis Dare]] in 1919]]
Holloway's stage career began in 1910, when he travelled to [[Walton-on-the-Naze]] to audition for ''The White [[Coon song|Coon]]s Show'', a [[Concert party (entertainment)|concert party]] [[variety show]] arranged and produced by Will C. Pepper, father of [[Harry S. Pepper]], with whom Holloway later starred in ''[[The Co-Optimists (film)|The Co-Optimists]]''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Holloway and Richards, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; This seaside show lasted six weeks.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Holloway and Richards, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1913 Holloway was recruited by the comedian [[Leslie Henson]] to feature as a support in Henson's more prestigious concert party called ''Nicely, Thanks''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; In later life, Holloway often spoke of his admiration for Henson, citing him as a great influence on his career. The two became firm friends and often consulted each other before taking jobs.{{#tag:ref|Henson's death in 1957 came when Holloway was experiencing a career high in ''[[My Fair Lady]]'', which had started on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in 1956.  Holloway recalled that Henson had been overlooked for the part of Alfred P. Doolittle when auditioning began in 1954, and Holloway wrote in his memoir that he regretted this deeply.&lt;ref&gt;Holloway and Richards, p. 295&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} In his 1967 autobiography, Holloway dedicated a whole chapter to Henson,&lt;ref&gt;Holloway and Richards, p. 289&lt;/ref&gt; whom he described as "the greatest friend, inspiration and mentor a performer could have had".&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Later in 1913, Holloway decided to train as an operatic [[baritone]], and so he went to Italy to take singing lessons from Ferdinando Guarino in [[Milan]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; However, a yearning to start a career in light entertainment and a contract to re-appear in Bert Graham and Will Bentley's concert party at the [[West Cliff Theatre]] caused him to return home after six months.&lt;ref&gt;Holloway and Richards, pp. 54–55&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early months of 1914, Holloway made his first visit to the US and then went to [[Buenos Aires]] and [[Valparaíso]] with the concert party ''The Grotesques''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.ancestry.co.uk/cgi-bin/sse.dll?db=BT26&amp;h=9279907&amp;indiv=try&amp;o_vc=Record:OtherRecord&amp;rhSource=7814 The National Archives of the UK, ''Board of Trade, Commercial and Statistical Department and successors, Inwards Passenger Lists''], ancestry.co.uk, accessed 9 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; At the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, he decided to return to England, but his departure was delayed for six weeks due to his contract with the troupe.&lt;ref&gt;Holloway and Richards, pp. 56–57&lt;/ref&gt;  At the age of 25, Holloway enlisted in the [[Connaught Rangers]]&lt;ref name="Holloway and Richards, p. 58"/&gt; in which he was commissioned as a [[subaltern]] in December 1915 &lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=29396|supp=y| date=7 December 1915|page=12297}}&lt;/ref&gt; because of his previous training in the London Rifle Brigade.&lt;ref name="Holloway and Richards, p. 58"/&gt; He was stationed in Cork and initially fought against the rebels in the [[Easter Rising]] of 1916.&lt;ref&gt;Holloway and Richards, pp. 58–59&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, he was sent to France,&lt;ref&gt;Holloway and Richards, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; where he fought in the trenches alongside [[Michael John O'Leary|Michael O'Leary]], who later won the [[Victoria Cross]] for gallantry.&lt;ref name="Holloway and Richards, p. 60"&gt;Holloway and Richards, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;  Holloway and O'Leary stayed in touch after the war and remained close friends.&lt;ref name="Holloway and Richards, p. 60"/&gt;

Holloway spent much of his time in the later part of the war organising shows to boost army morale in France.&lt;ref&gt;Holloway and Richards, pp. 60 and 76&lt;/ref&gt;  One such [[revue]], ''Wear That Ribbon'', was performed in honour of O'Leary winning the VC.&lt;ref name="Holloway and Richards, p. 60"/&gt; He, Henson and his newly established ''Star Attractions'' concert party, entertained the British troops in [[Wimereux]].&lt;ref&gt;Holloway and Richards, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; The party included such performers as [[Jack Buchanan]], [[Eric Blore]], [[Binnie Hale]], and [[Phyllis Dare]], as well as the performers who would later form ''The Co-Optimists''.&lt;ref name="Holloway and Richards, p. 20"&gt;Holloway and Richards, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his return from France, Holloway was stationed in [[Hartlepool]],&lt;ref name=Holloway76&gt;Holloway and Richards, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; and immediately after the war ended he starred in ''The Disorderly Room'' with Leslie Henson, which Eric Blore had written while serving in the [[South Wales Borderers]].&lt;ref name="Holloway and Richards, p. 60"/&gt;  The production toured theatres on England's coast, including [[Walton-on-the-Naze]] and [[Clacton-on-Sea]].&lt;ref name="Holloway and Richards, p. 60"/&gt;

After relinquishing his army commission in May 1919,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|title=4th Conn. Rang. – Lt. S. A.

Later that month, he created the role of Captain Wentworth in [[Guy Bolton]] and [[P. G. Wodehouse]]'s ''[[Kissing Time]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Findon, B. H., "Kissing Time", ''[[The Play Pictorial]]'', May 1919, p. 82; "Theatres", ''The Times'', 3 July 1920, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; followed in 1920 by the role of René in ''[[A Night Out (musical)|A Night Out]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"A Night Out", ''The Play Pictorial'', September 1920, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; Following its provincial success, ''The Disorderly Room'' was given a West End production at the [[Victoria Palace Theatre]] in late 1919, in which Holloway starred alongside Henson and [[Tom Walls]].&lt;ref&gt;Holloway and Richards, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; Holloway made his film debut in a 1921 silent comedy called ''The Rotters''.&lt;ref name=epm&gt;[http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/epm/12660 "Holloway, Stanley Augustus (1890–1982)",] ''Oxford Encyclopedia of Popular Music'', Oxford University Press, 2006, online edition, accessed 5 December 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From June 1921, Holloway had considerable success in ''[[The Co-Optimists]]'', a concert party formed with performers whom he had met during the war in France, which ''[[The Times]]'' called "an all-star '[[Concert party (entertainment)|pierrot]]' entertainment in the West-end."&lt;ref&gt;"The Theatres", ''The Times'', 20 June 1921, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; It opened at the small [[Royalty Theatre]]&lt;ref&gt;Holloway and Richards, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; and soon transferred to the much larger [[Palace Theatre, London|Palace Theatre]], where the initial version of the show ran for over a year, giving more than 500 performances.&lt;ref&gt;"The Palace Itself Again&amp;nbsp;– Co-Optimists' Cheery Burlesque", ''The Times'', 23 August 1921, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Holloway29&gt;Holloway and Richards, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;  The entertainment was completely rewritten at regular intervals to keep it fresh, and the final edition, beginning in November 1926, was the 13th version.&lt;ref&gt;"The Co-Optimists", ''The Times'', 30 November 1926, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Co-Optimists'' closed in 1927 at [[Her Majesty's Theatre|His Majesty's Theatre]] after 1,568 performances over eight years.&lt;ref name=Holloway29/&gt; In 1929, [[The Co-Optimists (film)|a feature film version]] was made, with Holloway rejoining his former co-stars.&lt;ref&gt;"The Film World", ''The Times'', 18 December 1929, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1923 Holloway established himself as a [[BBC Radio]] performer. The early BBC broadcasts brought variety and classical artists together, and Holloway could be heard in the same programme as the cellist [[John Barbirolli]] or the [[Band of the Scots Guards]].&lt;ref&gt;"Programmes for the Week-End", ''The Times'', 16 January 1926, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; He developed his solo act throughout the 1920s while continuing his involvement with the musical theatre and ''The Co-Optimists''. In 1924 he made his first gramophone discs, recording for [[HMV Records|HMV]] two songs from ''The Co-Optimists'': "London Town" and "Memory Street".&lt;ref&gt;HMV records 1724 and 1725 (1924)&lt;/ref&gt;  After ''The Co-Optimists'' disbanded in 1927, Holloway played at the [[Hippodrome, London|London Hippodrome]] in [[Vincent Youmans]]'s musical comedy ''[[Hit the Deck (musical)|Hit the Deck]]'' as Bill Smith, a performance judged by ''The Times'' to be "invested with many shrewd touches of humanity".&lt;ref&gt;"Hit the Deck", ''The Times'', 4 November 1927, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Manchester Guardian]]'', [[Ivor Brown]] praised him for a singing style "which coaxes the ear rather than clubbing the head."&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Ivor. "Hit the Deck", ''The Manchester Guardian'', 4 November 1927, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fine and dandy with Holloway and Henson.JPG|thumb|left|px=200|alt=stage shot of two actors in mid scene dressed in historic war costumes|Holloway as Sam Small in ''Fine and Dandy'' with Leslie Henson]]
Holloway began regularly performing monologues, both on stage and on record, in 1928, with his own creation, Sam Small, in ''Sam, Sam, Pick oop thy Musket''.{{#tag:ref|Holloway had earlier performed [[R. P. Weston]] and [[Bert Lee]]'s ''And yet I don't know'' at the Winter Garden Theatre in 1919.&lt;ref name=Holloway76/&gt; He later took up their numbers, ''Brahn Boots'', ''[[With Her Head Tucked Underneath Her Arm]]'' and ''Yorkshire Puddin''.|group= n}} Over the following years, he recorded more than 20&amp;nbsp;monologues based around the character, most of which he wrote himself. He created Sam Small after Henson had returned from a tour of northern England and told him a story about an insubordinate old soldier from the [[Battle of Waterloo]].&lt;ref name=H83&gt;Holloway and Richards, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; Holloway developed the character, naming him after a Cockney friend of Henson called Annie Small;&lt;ref name=H85&gt;Holloway and Richards, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; the name Sam was chosen at random. Holloway adopted a northern accent for the character.&lt;ref name=H85/&gt; ''The Times'' commented, "For absolute delight&amp;nbsp;... there is nothing to compare with Mr. Stanley Holloway's monologue, concerning a military contretemps on the eve of Waterloo&amp;nbsp;... perfect, even to the curled moustache and the [[Lancashire]] accent of the stubborn Guardsman hero."&lt;ref&gt;"Variety Theatres", ''The Times'', 12 February 1929, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, Edgar wrote 16 monologues for him. In its obituary of Holloway, ''The Times'' wrote that Sam and Albert "became part of English folklore during the 1930s, and they remained so during the Second World War."&lt;ref name=times/&gt; These monologues employed the Holloway style that has been called "the understated look-on-the-bright-side world of the cockney working class. ...

On the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 Holloway, who was 49, was too old for active service.

In 1954 Holloway joined the [[Old Vic]] theatre company to play Bottom in ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', with [[Robert Helpmann]] as Oberon and [[Moira Shearer]] as Titania. After playing at the [[Edinburgh Festival]], the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] took the production to New York, where it played at the [[Metropolitan Opera|Metropolitan Opera House]] and then on tour of the US and Canada. The production was harshly reviewed by critics on both sides of the Atlantic, but Holloway made a strong impression.{{#tag:ref|Both the anonymous critic of ''The Times'' and [[Brooks Atkinson]] in ''[[The New York Times]]'' thought the production slow and old-fashioned, and took particular exception to the use of [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]]'s incidental music.&lt;ref&gt;"Old Vic Company in New York&amp;nbsp;– Edinburgh Production Harshly Criticized", ''The Times'', 23 September 1954, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; The performances of Holloway and his colleagues are preserved on an HMV sound recording of the production (HMV catalogue number ALP1262-4 (1955)). ''[[Gramophone (magazine)|The Gramophone]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s critic wrote, "the great comedian Stanley Holloway retained his perfect timing but gave his lines their full Shakespearean weight".&lt;ref&gt;Postgate, Mary.

From that American tour came the part of Alfred Doolittle in ''[[My Fair Lady]]'' and from then on, well, just let's say I was able to pick and choose my parts and that was very pleasant at my age."&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times; Obituary'' 31 January 1982, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;  Holloway's film career continued simultaneously with his stage work; one example was the 1956 comedy ''[[Jumping for Joy]]''.

In 1956 Holloway created the role of Alfred P. Doolittle in the original  [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production of ''[[My Fair Lady]]''. The librettist, [[Alan Jay Lerner]], remembered in his memoirs that Holloway was his first choice for the role, even before it was written. Lerner's only concern was whether, after so long away from the musical stage, Holloway still had his resonant singing voice. Holloway reassured him over a lunch at [[Claridge's]]: Lerner recalled, "He put down his knife and fork, threw back his head and unleashed a strong baritone note that resounded through the dining room, drowned out the string quartet and sent a few dozen people off to the osteopath to have their necks untwisted."&lt;ref&gt;Lerner, pp. 62–63&lt;/ref&gt; Holloway had a long association with the show, appearing in the original 1956 Broadway production at the [[Mark Hellinger Theatre]], the 1958 London version at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]], and the [[My Fair Lady (film)|film version]] in 1964, which he undertook instead of the role of Admiral Bloom in ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'' that he had been offered the same year.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''[[The Manchester Guardian]]'', [[Alistair Cooke]] wrote, "Stanley Holloway distils into the body of Doolittle the taste and smell of every pub in England."&lt;ref&gt;Cooke, Alistair.

Looking back in 2004, Holloway's biographer [[Eric Midwinter]] wrote, "With his cockney authenticity, his splendid baritone voice, and his wealth of comedy experience, he made a great success of this role, and, as he said, it put him 'bang on top of the heap, in demand' again at a time when, in his mid-sixties, his career was beginning to wane".&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holloway and Richards, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; His performances earned him a [[Tony Award]] nomination for Best Featured Actor in a Musical and an [[Academy Award]] nomination for Best Actor in a Supporting Role.

===Personal life===
Holloway was married twice, first to Alice "Queenie" Foran. They met in June 1913 in Clacton, while he was performing in a concert party and she was selling charity flags on behalf of the [[Royal National Lifeboat Institution]].&lt;ref&gt;Holloway and Richards, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; Queenie was orphaned at the age of&amp;nbsp;16, something that Holloway felt he and Queenie had in common, as his mother had died that year and his father had earlier abandoned the family. He married Queenie in November 1913.&lt;ref name="Holloway and Richards, p. 68" /&gt;

Holloway and Queenie had four children: Joan, born on Holloway's 24th birthday in 1914, Patricia (b. 1920), John (1925–2013) and Mary (b. 1928).&lt;ref&gt;Holloway and Richards, pp. 69–70&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the death of her mother, Queenie inherited some property in [[Southampton Row]] and relied on the rents from the property for her income.&lt;ref name=H71&gt;Holloway and Richards, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;  During the First World War, while Holloway was away fighting in France, Queenie began to have financial trouble, as the tenants failed to pay their rent. Out of desperation, she approached several loan sharks, incurring a huge debt about which Holloway knew nothing.&lt;ref name=H71/&gt;  She also started to drink heavily as the pressures from the war and of supporting her daughter took their toll.&lt;ref name=H71/&gt; On Holloway's return from the war, the debt was paid off and they moved to [[Hampstead]], West London.&lt;ref&gt;London Metropolitan Archives, ''Electoral Registers of London (1929)'', p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 1920s, Holloway found himself in financial difficulties with the British tax authorities and was briefly declared bankrupt.&lt;ref&gt;"An Actor's Affairs", ''The Times'', 4 December 1931, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Stanley Holloway's Affairs", ''Nottingham Evening Post'', 3 December 1931, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1930s, Holloway and Queenie moved to [[Bayswater]]&lt;ref&gt;"Tragedy of Stanley Holloway's Wife", ''Evening Telegraph'', 25 November 1937, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; and remained there until Queenie's death in 1937 at the age of&amp;nbsp;45, from [[cirrhosis of the liver]].&lt;ref&gt;London Metropolitan Archives, ''Electoral Registers of London (1937)'', p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holloway and Richards, pp. 71–72&lt;/ref&gt; Of the children from this first marriage, John worked as an engineer in an electrics company, and Mary worked for [[British Petroleum]] for many years.&lt;ref&gt;Holloway and Richards, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 January 1939, Holloway married a 25-year-old actress and former chorus dancer named Violet Marion Lane (1913–1997)&lt;ref name=H170&gt;Holloway and Richards, pp. 170–71&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;General Register Office, ''England and Wales Civil Registration Indexes'' vol. 8d, p. 182&lt;/ref&gt; and they moved to [[Marylebone]].&lt;ref&gt;London Metropolitan Archives, ''Electoral Registers of London'' (1939), p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;  Violet was born into a working-class family from [[Leeds]]. Her mother was Scottish, and her civil engineer father, Alfred Lane, was a [[Yorkshire]]man.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;&lt;ref name=H170/&gt;  Holloway's second marriage lasted over 40&amp;nbsp;years until his death in 1982. Although he was a client of the Aza Agency in London, Violet effectively managed Holloway's career, and no project was taken on without her approval. In his autobiography, Holloway said of her, "I suppose I am committing lawful bigamy. Not only is she my wife, lover, mother, cook, chauffeuse, private secretary, house keeper, hostess, electrician, business manager, critic, handy woman, she is also my best friend."&lt;ref&gt;Holloway and Richards, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; Together, they had one son, [[Julian Holloway|Julian]], who also became an actor and is best known for appearing in the ''[[Carry On (franchise)|Carry On]]'' films.  Julian had a brief relationship with [[Patricia Neal]]'s daughter [[Tessa Dahl]] which produced a daughter, the model and author [[Sophie Dahl]].&lt;ref&gt;Banks-Smith, Nancy.

Holloway, Violet and Julian lived mainly in the tiny village of [[Penn, Buckinghamshire]].&lt;ref&gt;Holloway and Richards, p. 322&lt;/ref&gt; Holloway also owned other properties including a flat in [[St John's Wood]] in North West London,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gettyimages.co.uk/detail/3433132/Hulton-Archive Holloway's Flat in St. John's Wood (1933)].

The final years of his life were spent in [[Angmering]], West Sussex, with Violet. Holloway forged close friendships with fellow performers including Leslie Henson, Gracie Fields, [[Maurice Chevalier]], Laurence Olivier&lt;ref&gt;Holloway and Richards, p. 227&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Arthur Askey]], who said of him, "He was the nicest man I ever knew. He never had a wrong word to say about anyone. He was a great actor, a super mimic and a one-man walking comic show."&lt;ref&gt;"Stanley Holloway dies, 91", ''[[The Sunday Express]]'', 31 January 1982&lt;/ref&gt; While working in the US, Holloway numbered among his friends [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Dean Martin]], [[Burgess Meredith]] and Groucho Marx.&lt;ref&gt;Holloway and Richards, p. 333&lt;/ref&gt;
