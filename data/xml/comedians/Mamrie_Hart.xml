She began her main channel, ''You Deserve A Drink'' (YDAD), on March 13, 2011, where she primarily posts weekly instructional [[cocktail|mixology]] videos, with a unique cocktail presented in each, allowing her to combine her past work experience as a bartender with performing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Main|first=Sami|title=Had A Hard Day?

Her favorite drink is a gin gimlet, straight up.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

About her book, Hart said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Each chapter will have its own recipe, so in an ideal world, when you are reading about that time I fell in love with the half-snake, half-man guy and ran off with him to work in the carnival for a summer, you will make the cotton candy martini to drink while you read. Side note: That isn't actually one of my stories. The half-snake, half-man guy was way too good for me.&lt;ref name="Daily Dot"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As to the style, she stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;My whole brand of humor is self-deprecation — about owning your flaws and saying 'Fuck you' to anyone who doesn't like it," she says. "Hopefully that feeling will come across in [this book]. To where if you have a really embarrassing story, embrace it... Every story that I'll tell will lead up to why I am why I am.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thevideoink.com/breaking-news/mamrie-hart-bring-boozy-memoir-deserve-drink-fans-2015-exclusive/#.U3orBVhdWwg |title=Exclusive: Mamrie Hart to Bring Boozy Memoir ‘You Deserve a Drink’ to Fans in 2015 |publisher=VideoInk |date=January 21, 2014 |accessdate=May 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
