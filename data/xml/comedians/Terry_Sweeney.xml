== Early life and career ==
Terrence (Terry) Sweeney was born in 1950&lt;!-- Not 1960; that would put him graduating high school at the age of 9 and university at 13. --&gt; in [[Queens]], New York and raised in [[Massapequa Park, New York]] as the younger of two children to Terrence, a butcher, and Lenore Sweeney.&lt;ref name="people-june1986"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hutchings|first=David|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20093779,00.html|title=Terry Sweeney Opens Some Eyes, and Maybe a Few Minds, as Saturday Night Live's First Lady|date=1986-06-02|publisher=people.com|accessdate=2012-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a child, he was bullied and found solace in books, including the [[Nancy Drew]] mysteries, as well as in performing his own Broadway plays.&lt;ref name="people-june1986" /&gt; At a young age, his interest in the performing arts grew.&lt;ref name="splitsider-2012"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wright|first=Megh|url=http://splitsider.com/2012/04/saturday-nights-children-terry-sweeney-1985-1986/|title=Saturday Night's Children: Terry Sweeney (1985-1986)|date=2012-04-12|publisher=splitsider.com|accessdate=2012-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated Farmingdale High School in 1969 and attended [[Middlebury College]], where he learned Spanish and Italian and graduated in 1973 with a bachelor of arts degree.&lt;ref name="people-june1986" /&gt; In his sophomore year, he got engaged to a woman, even though he had started identifying himself as [[gay]] by the fourth grade.&lt;ref name="people-june1986" /&gt; Before becoming a writer, he worked as a drug rehabilitation counselor and waiter.&lt;ref name="people-june1986" /&gt;

=== ''Saturday Night Live'' ===
Sweeney is best known for his appearances as a regular cast member of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (''SNL'') during that program's 1985â€“86 season. He was discovered by series producer [[Lorne Michaels]] while Sweeney was performing in a New York play,&lt;ref name="dailynews-losangeles"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=LA&amp;p_theme=la&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EF5BA1F2EF8E466&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|title=COMEDY NEWS &amp; NOTES|date=February 9, 1990|publisher=''Daily News of Los Angeles''|accessdate=October 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Banned in France,'' in 1983.&lt;ref name="people-june1986" /&gt; Sweeney, who is not related to fellow ''SNL'' alumna [[Julia Sweeney]], was also a sketch writer for ''SNL'' during the early 1980s under producer [[Jean Doumanian]] prior to being hired as a member of the cast.

He was ''SNL'''s first [[coming out|openly]] [[gay]] male cast member; Sweeney was "out" prior to being hired as a cast member.&lt;ref name="shales"&gt;{{citation |title=Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live |first=Tom |last=Shales |first2=James Andrew |last2=Miller |year=2002 |publisher=Back Bay |isbn=0-316-73565-5 |page=316}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sweeney's run on the show came at a time when there were few openly gay characters or actors on television. For roughly 27 years, there were no other openly gay cast members on ''SNL'',&lt;ref name="afterelton-2010"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hartinger|first=Brent|url=http://www.thebacklot.com/ask-the-flying-monkey-why-is-steel-magnolias-fabulous-or-is-it/11/2010/|title=Ask the Flying Monkey: Why Is "Steel Magnolias" Fabulous? (Or IS It?)|date=November 21, 2010|publisher=afterelton.com|accessdate=October 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; until [[Kate McKinnon]] (a former cast member of Logo's ''The Big Gay Sketch Show'') was added to the cast in April 2012.

During his season on ''SNL'', he became known for his celebrity impersonations, particularly female impersonations of stars like [[Diana Ross]],&lt;ref name="dailynews-losangeles" /&gt; [[Patti LaBelle]],&lt;ref name="dailynews-losangeles" /&gt; [[Joan Collins]], [[Brooke Shields]]'s mother Teri Shields, and [[Joan Rivers]],&lt;ref name="dailynews-losangeles" /&gt; as well as [[Ted Kennedy]]&lt;ref name="dailynews-losangeles" /&gt; (the only male celebrity he impersonated). His most notable recurring character was a portrayal of then-First Lady [[Nancy Reagan]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Roush|first=Matt|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/USAToday/access/55694835.html?dids=55694835:55694835&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jun+15%2C+1987&amp;author=Matt+Roush&amp;pub=USA+TODAY+%28pre-1997+Fulltext%29&amp;desc=Sweeney+will+drag+Nancy+along+to+%60The+Late+Show%27&amp;pqatl=google|title=Sweeney will drag Nancy along to `The Late Show'|date=June 15, 1987|publisher=''USA Today''|accessdate=October 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dyess-Nugent|first=Phil|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/distilling-4-decades-of-saturday-night-live-down-t,85102/|title=Distilling 4 decades of Saturday Night Live down to just 10 episodes|date=September 19, 2012|publisher=avclub.com|accessdate=October 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; While at ''SNL'', he faced many hardships from both the writers and cast because of his sexuality, especially from [[Chevy Chase]].&lt;ref name="splitsider-2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="shales" /&gt; Sweeney was told by [[Ron Reagan]], who hosted one of that season's episodes, that he was "more like his mother than she is."
