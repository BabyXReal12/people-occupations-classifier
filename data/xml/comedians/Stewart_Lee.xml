'''Stewart Graham Lee''' (born 5 April 1968) is an English [[stand-up comedian]], writer and director. In the mid-1990s he was one half of the radio duo [[Lee and Herring]], alongside [[Richard Herring]]. He co-wrote and co-directed the [[West End theatre|West End]] hit musical ''[[Jerry Springer: The Opera]]'', a critical success that sparked a backlash from Christian groups who staged a series of protests outside its early stagings.

After a return to the live circuit, and through [[BBC]] and [[Channel 4]] specials and series, Lee has rebuilt an audience and a reputation as an anti-populist comedian. In December 2011 he won [[British Comedy Awards]] for best male television comic and best comedy entertainment programme for his series ''[[Stewart Lee's Comedy Vehicle]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-16229511|title=Stewart Lee and Victoria Wood among 2011 comedy winners|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=17 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2009 article in ''[[The Times]]'' referred to him as "the comedian's comedian, and for good reason" and named him "face of the decade".&lt;ref name="Maxwell"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/stage/comedy/article6964139.ece|title=The decade in comedy|last=Maxwell|first=Dominic|date=22 December 2009|work=The Times|accessdate=5 May 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2012 Lee was placed at number 9 in the Top 100 Most Influential People in UK Comedy.&lt;ref name="Clark"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.suchsmallportions.com/feature/top-100-most-influential-people-comedy-20-1 |title=The Top 100 most influential people in comedy: 20 – 1|last=Clark|first=Tim|date=22 June 2012|publisher=Such Small Portions|accessdate=24 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His stand-up is characterised by [[Repetition (rhetorical device)|repetition]], frequent [[Callback (comedy)|callbacks]], generally nonchalant delivery and a pronounced use of deconstruction, which he often self-consciously refers to on stage.&lt;ref name="McAlpine"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spoonfed.co.uk/spooners/emma-422/stewart-lee-live-review-if-you-prefer-a-milder-comedian-please-ask-for-one-1838/|title=Stewart Lee live review: If You Prefer A Milder Comedian Please Ask For One|last=McAlpine|first=Emma|date=10 December 2009|publisher=Spoonfed|accessdate=5 May 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201233637/http://www.spoonfed.co.uk/spooners/emma-422/stewart-lee-live-review-if-you-prefer-a-milder-comedian-please-ask-for-one-1838/|archivedate=1 December 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===1989–1993: Stand-up and radio===
While studying English at [[St Edmund Hall, Oxford]], in the 1980s, he wrote and performed comedy in a revue group called "[[The Seven Raymonds]]" with [[Richard Herring]], [[Emma Kennedy]] and [[Tim Richardson (writer)|Tim Richardson]], but did not perform in the well-known [[The Oxford Revue|Oxford Revue]], though he did write for and direct the 1989 Revue. Having moved to London and begun performing stand-up comedy after university, he rose to greater prominence in 1990, winning the prestigious [[Hackney Empire New Act of the Year]] competition.

With Herring, Lee wrote material for [[BBC Radio 4]]'s ''[[On the Hour]]'' (1991), which was anchored by [[Chris Morris (satirist)|Chris Morris]] and was notable for the first appearance of [[Steve Coogan]]'s celebrated character, [[Alan Partridge]], for which Lee and Herring wrote much early material. After a disagreement with the rest of the cast, Lee and Herring did not remain with the group when ''On The Hour'' moved to television as ''[[The Day Today]]'', and their material was excised from an official release of the radio show in the mid-1990s, although it was included in a CD released in 2008.

In 1992 and 1993, he and Herring wrote and performed ''[[Lionel Nimrod's Inexplicable World]]'' for BBC Radio 4, before moving to [[BBC Radio 1]], for one series of ''Fist of Fun'' (1993), followed by three series of ''[[Lee and Herring (radio series)|Lee and Herring]]''. Throughout the late nineties he continued performing solo stand-up (something that has always been a mainstay of his career – even whilst in the double act with Herring) and has collaborated with, amongst others, [[Julian Barratt]] and [[Noel Fielding]] of ''[[The Mighty Boosh]]''. Indeed, though Barratt and Fielding had worked together in the past, the first seeds of the Boosh were sown while working as part of Lee's Edinburgh show ''King Dong vs Moby Dick'' in which Barratt and Fielding played a giant penis and a whale, respectively. Lee returned the favour by going on to direct their 1999 Edinburgh show, ''[[Arctic Boosh]]'', which remains the template for their live work.

===2000–04: Quitting stand-up===
In 2001, Lee published his first novel, ''The Perfect Fool''; it was republished in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2010/02/03/10457/book_deal_for_stewart_lee|title=Book deal for Stewart Lee: Writing about his stand-up|publisher=Chortle|date=3 February 2010|accessdate=23 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year he performed ''Pea Green Boat'', a stand-up show which revolved around the deconstruction of the [[Edward Lear]] poem ''[[The Owl and the Pussycat]]'' and a tale of his own broken toilet. This would later be condensed to focus mainly on the poem itself, and a 15-minute version aired on Radio 4. In 2007, Go Faster Stripe released a 25-minute edit on CD &amp; 10" Vinyl.

During late 2000 and early 2001, Lee "gradually, incrementally and without any fanfare – or even much thought – gave up being a stand-up comedian",&lt;ref name=Escaped&gt;{{cite book|title=How I Escaped My Certain Fate: The Life and Deaths of a Stand-Up Comedian|first=Stewart|last=Lee|year=2010|location=London|publisher=Faber and Faber|isbn=0-571-25480-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=2}} and 2001 became the first year since 1987 that he did not perform at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.&lt;ref name=Escaped/&gt;{{rp|page=28}} While Lee found himself gradually performing less and less standup and moving away from the stage, he continued his directorial duties on television. Two pilots were made for [[Channel 4]], ''[[Cluub Zarathustra]]'' and ''Head Farm'', but neither was developed into a series. The former featured all the ingredients that would later appear in ''[[Attention Scum]]'', a BBC2 series fronted by [[Simon Munnery]]'s "League Against Tedium" character, which also featured the likes of [[Kevin Eldon]], [[Johnny Vegas]] and [[Roger Mann]], as well as [[Richard Thomas (musician)|Richard Thomas]] and opera singer [[Lore Lixenberg]], in their guise as "Kombat Opera".

At the 2003 Edinburgh Festival Fringe, Lee directed Johnny Vegas' first DVD, ''Who's Ready For Ice Cream?''. In 2004, he returned to stand-up comedy&lt;ref name="Armstrong"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article5896362.ece|title=Stewart Lee on his Comedy Vehicle|first=Stephen|last=Armstrong|work=The Sunday Times|date=15 March 2009|accessdate=20 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the show ''Standup Comedian'', which earned him a [[Tap Water Award]] in Edinburgh and was released on DVD in October 2005.&lt;ref name=Maxwell/&gt;

Lee is also known for writing music reviews and, when asked in 2003 what his favourites were, he said "Most of my favourites are still going like [[The Fall (band)|The Fall]], [[Giant Sand]] and [[Calexico (band)|Calexico]]. I listen to a lot of jazz, 60s and folk music but I really like [[Ms. Dynamite]], and [[The Streets]]".&lt;ref name="Pearce"/&gt; On stage, he has also referenced his love of [[free jazz]], and used the music of avant-garde guitarist [[Derek Bailey (guitarist)|Derek Bailey]] as incidental music in his DVD release of the show "Stand-Up Comedian".

===2005: ''Jerry Springer: The Opera''===
In January 2005, ''[[Jerry Springer: The Opera]]'', a [[satirical]] musical/opera based upon ''[[The Jerry Springer Show]]'', was broadcast on BBC Two, following a highly successful [[West End theatre|West End]] run for several years, and as a prelude to the show's UK Tour. [[Christian Voice (UK)|Christian Voice]] led a number of protest groups who claimed that the show was [[blasphemy|blasphemous]] and highly offensive. In particular, they were angered by the portrayal of Jesus Christ.

Disputes arose, with supporters claiming that most of the protesters had neither seen the show nor knew of its actual content. Others supported the right to freedom of speech. Several Christian groups protested at some of the venues used during the UK Tour. The show was broadcast with a record number of complaints prior to its transmission. In total, the BBC received 55,000 complaints.&lt;ref name=Akbar&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/features/edinburgh-cradle-of-shows-that-conquered-the-world-2041216.html|title=Edinburgh: Cradle of shows that conquered the world|first1=Arifa|last1=Akbar|first2=Harry|last2=Morgan|work=The Independent|date=2 August 2010|accessdate=2 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A private court case brought by Christian Voice against Lee and others involved with the production for [[blasphemy]] was rejected by a [[Magistrates' Court (England and Wales)|Magistrates' Court]].

===2009: ''Stewart Lee's Comedy Vehicle'' and ''If You Prefer a Milder Comedian, Please Ask for One''===
''[[Stewart Lee's Comedy Vehicle]]'', a new six-part comedy series featuring standup and sketches, began a six-episode run on 16 March 2009. The executive producer was [[Armando Iannucci]] and the script editor was [[Chris Morris (satirist)|Chris Morris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Toilet Books |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00jd8gp… |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130419184819/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00jd8gp%E2%80%A6 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=19 April 2013 |accessdate=18 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first episode received positive reviews from [[The Independent]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

|accessdate=18 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lee himself wrote a negative review of the show in ''[[Time Out (company)|Time Out]]'' in which he described himself as "fat" and his performance as "positively Neanderthal, suggesting a jungle-dwelling pygmy, struggling to coax notes out of a clarinet that has fallen from a passing aircraft".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stewart Lee returns in 'Stewart Lee's Comedy Vehicle'|publisher=Time Out|date=17 March 2009|url=http://www.timeout.com/london/comedy/features/7074/Stewart_Lee_returns_in-Stewart_Lee-s_Comedy_Vehicle-.html|accessdate=18 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Guardian]]'' named ''Comedy Vehicle'' as one of its top ten television highlights of 2009, commenting that it "was the kind of TV that makes you feel like you're not the only one wondering how we came to be surrounded by so much unquestioned mediocrity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2009/dec/19/best-television-of-2009|title=Pop culture 2009: The year in lists|last1=Dean|first1=Will|last2=Meer|first2=Malik|last3=Vine|first3=Richard|date=19 December 2009|work=The Guardian|accessdate=5 May 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the show's few negative reviews came in the ''Sunday Mercury'', which stated: "His whole tone is one of complete, smug condescension".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sundaymercury.net/entertainment-news/tv-news/2009/03/29/stewart-lee-is-a-condescending-snob-66331-23250841/|title=Stewart Lee is a condescending snob|last=Laws|first=Roz|date=29 March 2009|work=Sunday Mercury|accessdate=5 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lee subsequently used this line to advertise his next stand-up tour.&lt;ref name="Sommers"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gethampshire.co.uk/entertainment/s/2058560_stewart_lee_protests_cost_me_millionaire_status|title=Stewart Lee: Protests cost me millionaire status|last=Sommers|first=Jack|date=8 October 2009|publisher=Get Hampshire|accessdate=5 May 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809203914/http://www.gethampshire.co.uk/entertainment/s/2058560_stewart_lee_protests_cost_me_millionaire_status|archivedate=9 August 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lee frequently uses negative reviews on his posters in order to put off potential audience members who are unlikely to be fans of his comedy style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2010/aug/26/fringe-poster-edinburgh|title=Paste masters: the art of the Edinburgh fringe poster|first=James|last=Kettle|work=The Guardian|date=26 August 2010|accessdate=26 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lee also had a show at the 2009 Edinburgh Festival Fringe, named ''Stewart Lee: If You Prefer a Milder Comedian, Please Ask for One'' in which he performed his own version of the song "[[Galway Girl (Steve Earle song)|Galway Girl]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edinburghfestival.list.co.uk/event/10000760-stewart-lee-if-you-prefer-a-milder-comedian-please-ask-for-one/ |title=Stewart Lee: If You Prefer a Milder Comedian, Please Ask for One &amp;#124; Edinburgh Festival Guide |publisher=Edinburghfestival.list.co.uk |date=15 July 2009 |accessdate=17 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2009 Lee was nominated for Best Live Stand-up at the [[British Comedy Awards]].&lt;ref name="cheaptelevision"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cheaptelevision.co.uk/british-comedy-awards-2009-nominations/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110912070853/http://www.cheaptelevision.co.uk/british-comedy-awards-2009-nominations/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=12 September 2011 |title=British Comedy Awards 2009: Nominations |accessdate=24 October 2010 |work=cheaptelevision }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="britishcomedyawards"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishcomedyawards.com/winners06.html |title=British Comedy Awards: 2009 Winners |accessdate=24 October 2010 |work=britishcomedyawards |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101019233321/http://britishcomedyawards.com/winners06.html |archivedate=19 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stewart Lee toured a new two-hour show, ''Content Provider'', from November 2016 to April 2018 over 214 dates. This was recorded in [[Southend-on-Sea|Southend]], Essex by the BBC and was broadcast on BBC Two on 28 July 2018. The programme is intercut with "interrogator" interviews by [[Alan Moore]].

==Style and material==
Lee's stand-up sets comprise topical and sometimes [[observational comedy]], touching on [[religion]], [[feminism]] and life in multicultural [[London]]. However, he also employs [[Meta-joke|metahumour]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beyondthejoke.co.uk/content/opinion-whats-meta-stewart-lee|title=Opinion: What's The Meta With Stewart Lee?|work=Beyond The Joke}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes describes the structure of the set using technical terminology such as "[[Callback (comedy)|callback]]".

In an ironic manner he often criticises the audience for not being intelligent enough to understand the joke, preferring the more simplistic material, or enjoying the work of more mainstream "arena" comedians such as [[Michael McIntyre]] or [[Lee Mack]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/comedy/features/stewart-lee-beware--this-man-may-be-only-joking-9179085.html|title=Stewart Lee: Beware - this man may be only joking|work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lee will often contrast his ''critical'' success with other comics' more ''commercial'' success.

Lee caused controversy on his ''If You Prefer a Milder Comedian'' tour with a routine about ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]'' presenter [[Richard Hammond]]. Referring to Hammond's accident while filming in 2006, in which he was almost killed, Lee joked, "I wish he had been decapitated". The ''[[Daily Mail]]'' termed this an "extraordinary attack"&lt;ref name="Tapper"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1209921/What-prompted-comedians-tirade-old-schoolmate-Richard-Hammond.html|title=What prompted comedian's tirade against old schoolmate Richard Hammond?|last=Tapper|first=James|date=30 August 2009|work=Daily Mail|accessdate=5 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, having been doorstepped by a ''Mail'' journalist, Lee quoted the routine by replying "It's a joke, just like on ''Top Gear'' when they do their jokes".&lt;ref name="Donaldson"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.list.co.uk/article/23922-if-you-prefer-a-milder-comedian-please-ask-for-one-stewart-lee-interview/|title=If You Prefer a Milder Comedian Please Ask for One – Stewart Lee interview|last=Donaldson|first=Brian|date=25 February 2010|work=The List|accessdate=5 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lee subsequently explained the joke:

{{quote|The idea of what's acceptable and what's shocking, that's where I investigate. I mean, you can't be on ''Top Gear'', where your only argument is that it's all just a joke and anyone who takes offence is an example of political correctness gone mad, and then not accept the counterbalance to that. Put simply, if [[Jeremy Clarkson|Clarkson]] can say [[Gordon Brown|the prime minister]] is a one-eyed Scottish idiot, then I can say that I hope his children go blind.|Stewart Lee&lt;ref name="O'Hagan"/&gt;}}

In an ''Observer'' interview, [[Sean O'Hagan (journalist)|Sean O'Hagan]] says of the Hammond joke that Lee "operates out in that dangerous hinterland between moral provocation and outright offence, often adopting, as in this instance, the tactics of those he targets in order to highlight their hypocrisy".&lt;ref name="O'Hagan"/&gt;

After accepting an honorary fellowship from [[St Edmund Hall, Oxford]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.seh.ox.ac.uk/news/comedian-stewart-lee-accepts-honorary-fellowship|title=Comedian Stewart Lee accepts Honorary Fellowship|website=St Edmund Hall|accessdate=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lee gave a lecture to aspiring writers in which he mocked the fact that performers such as [[Frankie Boyle]], [[Michael McIntyre]], [[Jack Whitehall]] and [[Andi Osho]] used writers who were not credited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/comedy/news/stewart-lee-accuses-high-profile-comedians-michael-mcintrye-jack-whitehall-and-frankie-boyle-of-8718101.html|title=Stewart Lee accuses high-profile comedians Michael McIntrye, Jack|publisher=|accessdate=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He compared the practice to athletes using performance-enhancing drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/shortcuts/2013/jul/19/standup-comedians-write-own-jokes-stewart-lee|title=Should standup comedians write all their own jokes?|first=Bruce|last=Dessau|date=19 July 2013|website=the Guardian|accessdate=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with [[plagiarism]] and extremism Lee has brought moral issues surrounding stand-up to the public’s attention.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/sep/11/stewart-lee-jack-whitehall-comedians&lt;/ref&gt;
