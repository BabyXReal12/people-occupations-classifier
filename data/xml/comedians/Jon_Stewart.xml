'''Jon Stewart''' (born '''Jonathan Stuart Leibowitz'''; November 28, 1962) is an American comedian, writer, producer, director, political commentator, actor, and television host. He hosted ''[[The Daily Show]]'', a [[news satire|satirical news program]] on [[Comedy Central]], from 1999 to 2015.

Stewart started as a stand-up comedian, but branched into television as host of ''[[Short Attention Span Theater]]'' for Comedy Central. He went on to host his own show on [[MTV]], ''[[The Jon Stewart Show]]'', and then hosted ''[[You Wrote It, You Watch It]]'', also on MTV. He has also had several film roles as an actor, but has done few cinematic projects since becoming the host of ''The Daily Show'' in 1999. He was also a writer and co-executive producer of the show. After Stewart joined, ''The Daily Show'' steadily gained popularity and critical acclaim, and during his tenure, ''The Daily Show'' won 22 [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s.

Stewart is known as an outspoken, humorous critic of personality-driven media shows, in particular those of the [[Media of the United States|U.S. media]] networks such as [[CNN]], [[Fox News]], and [[MSNBC]]. Critics say Stewart benefits from a double standard: he critiques other news shows from the safe, removed position of his "[[news satire]]" desk.&lt;ref name="serious"&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Ken Tucker|Tucker, Ken]]|title=You Can't Be Serious!|publisher=''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]''|date=November 1, 2004|url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/arts/tv/10180/|accessdate=July 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN041015"&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=April 23, 2008|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0410/15/cf.01.html|title=CNN Crossfire|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stewart agrees, saying that neither his show nor his channel purports to be anything other than satire and comedy. In spite of its self-professed entertainment mandate, ''The Daily Show'' has been nominated for news and journalism [[List of awards and nominations received by The Daily Show with Jon Stewart|awards]]. Stewart hosted the [[78th Academy Awards|78th]] and [[80th Academy Awards]]. He is the co-author of ''[[America (The Book)|America (The Book): A Citizen's Guide to Democracy Inaction]]'', which was one of the best-selling books in the U.S. in 2004,&lt;ref name="Top15books2004"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/books/news/2004-12-20-top-books-of-2004_x.htm|work=[[USA Today]]|title=The top 100 selling books of 2004|date=December 20, 2004|accessdate=November 6, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Earth (The Book)|Earth (The Book): A Visitor's Guide to the Human Race]]'', released in 2010.

One of his grandfathers was born in [[Manzhouli]] (now part of [[Inner Mongolia]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/megan-smolenyak-smolenyak/hey-jon-stewart-your-roots_b_2755031.html|title=Hey Jon Stewart|date=February 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the second of four sons, with older brother Lawrence&lt;ref name=hyp/&gt; and younger brothers Dan and Matthew.&lt;ref name=dad-obit/&gt;

Stewart's parents divorced when he was eleven years old, and Stewart was largely estranged from his father.&lt;ref name=moment/&gt; Because of his strained relationship with his father, which in 2015 he described as "still 'complicated'", he dropped his surname and began using his middle name, Stuart. Stewart stated, "There was a thought of using my mother's maiden name, but I thought that would be just too big a fuck you to my dad...Did I have some problems with my father? Yes. Yet people always view [changing my surname] through the prism of ethnic identity."&lt;ref name=TheGuardian&gt;Freeman, Hadley (April 18, 2015).

Stewart grew up in the era of the [[Vietnam War]] and the [[Watergate scandal]], which inspired in him "a healthy skepticism towards official reports". His first job was working at a [[F. W. Woolworth Company|Woolworth's]] at which his brother Lawrence worked, and jokingly describes being fired by Lawrence as one of the "scarring events" of his youth.&lt;ref name=TheGuardian/&gt;

Stewart graduated in 1984 from the [[College of William &amp; Mary]] in [[Virginia]], where he played on the [[William &amp; Mary Tribe men's soccer|soccer team]] and initially majored in [[chemistry]] before switching to [[psychology]].&lt;ref name=moment/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|date=October 22, 2010|title=Bloomberg Game Changers: Jon Stewart|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/video/63932062/|medium=Television production|publisher=[[Bloomberg Television]]|accessdate=October 24, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101025111914/http://www.bloomberg.com/video/63932062/|archivedate=October 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; While at William &amp; Mary, Stewart became a brother of the [[Pi Kappa Alpha]] Fraternity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pikes.org/media/documents/recruitmentresources/brochure/prominent.html|title=Pikes|publisher=Pikes.org|accessdate=February 19, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921060236/http://www.pikes.org/media/documents/recruitmentresources/brochure/prominent.html|archivedate=September 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but later disassociated himself from the fraternity and left after six months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.askmen.com/celebs/men/entertainment_150/167_jon_stewart.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013103852/http://www.askmen.com/celebs/men/entertainment_150/167_jon_stewart.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=October 13, 2008|title=The Top 49 Men of 2010|publisher=AskMen.com|accessdate=February 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; "My college career was waking up late, memorizing someone else's notes, doing bong hits, and going to soccer practice," he would later recall.&lt;ref name="ny1994"&gt;{{cite news|author= Chris Smith|title=The Man Who Should Be Conan|date=1994|url=http://www.vulture.com/2014/10/jon-stewarts-1994-interview-with-new-york.html|work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|accessdate=November 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[Al Albert (soccer)|soccer coach]] would later describe him as a "good player" with "high energy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Jon Stewart: College Soccer Star Named "Leibo"|url = http://www.sportsgrid.com/media/jon-stewart-college-soccer-player-once-led-william-mary-to-an-upset-win-over-uconn/|website = SportsGrid|access-date = February 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After college, Stewart held numerous jobs: a contingency planner for the New Jersey Department of Human Services, a contract administrator for the [[City University of New York]], a puppeteer for children with disabilities, a soccer coach at [[Gloucester High School (Virginia)|Gloucester High School]] in Virginia, a caterer, a busboy, a shelf stocker at [[F.

==Career==

===Early work===
With a reputation for being a funny man in school,&lt;ref name=moment/&gt;&lt;ref name="mtv"/&gt; Jon Stewart returned to [[New York City]] in 1986 to try his hand at the [[comedy club]] circuit, but he could not muster the courage to get on stage until the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1993-05-27/news/ol-40130_1_jon-stewart|title=He Has Faith in His Jokes|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|author=McLellan, Dennis|date=May 27, 1993|accessdate=June 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his [[stand-up comedy|stand-up]] debut at [[The Bitter End]], where his comedic idol, [[Woody Allen]], also began.&lt;ref name="cool"&gt;{{cite web|author=Speidel, Maria|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20107783,00.html|title=Prince of Cool Air|publisher=[[People (magazine)|People]]|date=April 4, 1994|accessdate=May 7, 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140304171657/http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20107783,00.html|archivedate=March 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began using the [[stage name]] "Jon Stewart" by dropping his last name and changing the spelling of his middle name "Stuart" to "Stewart". He often jokes this is because people had difficulty with the pronunciation of Leibowitz or it "sounded too Hollywood" (a reference to [[Lenny Bruce]]'s joke on the same theme).&lt;ref name="record"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://jon.happyjoyfun.net/tran/1990/94_0000record.html|title=Nighttime Talk, MTV Style|publisher=''[[The Record (Bergen County)|The Record]]''|author=Howard, Susan|year=1994|accessdate=June 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has implied that the name change was actually due to a strained relationship with his father, with whom Stewart no longer had any contact.&lt;ref name=oscar&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/feb/26/broadcasting.oscars2006|title=The Oscar for best satirist goes to ...|publisher=The Observer|date=February 26, 2006|author=Harris, Paul|accessdate=October 21, 2008|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stewart became a regular at the [[Comedy Cellar]], where he was the last performer every night. For two years, he would perform at 2 a.m. while developing his comedic style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Jon Stewart|episodelink=Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg|series=Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg|serieslink=Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg|network=[[TV Land]]|airdate=March 14, 2007|season=2|number=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, Stewart landed his first television job as a writer for ''[[Caroline's Comedy Hour]]''. In 1990, he began co-hosting [[Comedy Central]]'s ''[[Short Attention Span Theater]]'', with [[Patty Rosborough]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Weiner|first1=Jonah|title=Comedy Central in the Post-TV Era|url=https://mobile.nytimes.com/slideshow/100000003747353/2015/06/21/magazine/comedy-central-in-the-post-tv-era/s/21mag-comedycentral-ss-slide-KWZZ.html|accessdate=November 6, 2017|work=New York Times|date=June 21, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107030309/https://mobile.nytimes.com/slideshow/100000003747353/2015/06/21/magazine/comedy-central-in-the-post-tv-era/s/21mag-comedycentral-ss-slide-KWZZ.html|archive-date=November 7, 2017|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, Stewart hosted the short-lived ''[[You Wrote It, You Watch It]]'' on MTV, which invited viewers to send in their stories to be acted out by the comedy troupe, [[The State (1993 TV series)|The State]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gerston|first1=Jill|title=MTV Has a Hit With Words By Jon Stewart|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/13/arts/television-mtv-has-a-hit-with-words-by-jon-stewart.html|accessdate=November 6, 2017|work=New York Times|date=March 13, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stewart felt his career did not take off until a March 1993 appearance on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]''.&lt;ref name="ny1994"/&gt; He was considered a finalist to take over Letterman's position upon his departure from the program, but it was instead given to relatively unknown [[Conan O'Brien]].&lt;ref name="record"/&gt;

===''The Jon Stewart Show''===
Later in 1993, Stewart developed ''[[The Jon Stewart Show]]'', a [[talk show]] on [[MTV]]. ''The Jon Stewart Show'' was the first talk show on that network and was an instant hit, becoming the second-highest rated MTV show behind ''[[Beavis and Butt-head]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/jonstewartshow/jontvguide.htm|title=New York's Mr. Schmooze|author=Kaplan, Michael|work=[[TV Guide]]|date=February 19, 1994|accessdate=June 21, 2007|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/jonstewartshow/jontvguide.htm&amp;date=2009-10-26+01:00:29|archivedate=October 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] canceled ''[[The Arsenio Hall Show]]'' and, with new corporate sibling MTV (through MTV parent [[Viacom]]'s acquisition of the studio), launched an hour-long [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] late-night version of ''The Jon Stewart Show''. Many local affiliates had moved Hall's show to 2 a.m. during its decline and Stewart's show inherited such early morning time slots in many cities. Ratings were dismal and the show was canceled in June 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lisa de Moraes |url=http://deadline.com/2016/08/jon-stewart-visits-larry-wilmore-final-nightly-show-peter-thiel-1201805694/ |title=[Watch&amp;#93; Jon Stewart To Larry Wilmore: “What Did You Do, Piss Off Peter Thiel?” |publisher=Deadline |date=August 19, 2016 |accessdate=August 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the fans of the show was [[David Letterman]], who was the final guest of ''The Jon Stewart Show''. Letterman signed Stewart with his production company, [[Worldwide Pants]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jon.happyjoyfun.net/tran/1990/96_0696plaindealer.html|title=Comic Stewart Set to Head CBS Talker|work=[[The Plain Dealer]]|date=June 6, 1996|accessdate=June 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stewart then became a frequent guest host for [[Tom Snyder]] on ''[[The Late Late Show (CBS TV series)|The Late Late Show with Tom Snyder]]'', which was produced by Letterman and aired after the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman|Late Show]]'' on [[CBS]]. This led to much speculation that Stewart would soon replace Snyder permanently,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jon.happyjoyfun.net/tran/1990/96_1001usatoday.html|title=Stewart to Sub&amp;nbsp;– Not Take Over&amp;nbsp;– for Snyder|publisher=USA Today|author=Johnson, Peter|date=October 1, 1996|accessdate=June 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Stewart was instead offered the time slot after Snyder's, which he turned down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jon.happyjoyfun.net/tran/1990/97_1125nypost.html|title=What's the Deal With Stewart?|publisher=[[New York Post]]|author=Adaliang, Josef|date=November 25, 1997|accessdate=June 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996 Stewart hosted a short-lived talk show called "[[Where's Elvis This Week?]]" It was a half-hour, weekly comedy television program that aired on Sunday nights in the United Kingdom on [[BBC Two]]. It was filmed at the [[CBS]] Broadcast Center in [[New York City]] and featured a set of panelists, two from the United Kingdom and two from the [[United States]], who discussed news items and cultural issues. The show premiered in the UK on October 6, 1996; five episodes aired in total. Notable panelists included [[Dave Chappelle]], [[Eddie Izzard]], [[Phil Jupitus]], [[Nora Ephron]], [[Craig Kilborn]], [[Christopher Hitchens]], [[Armando Iannucci]], [[Norm Macdonald]], and [[Helen Gurley Brown]]. In 1997, Stewart was chosen as the host and interviewer for George Carlin's 10th HBO special, ''40 Years of Comedy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/3032418|title=Jon Stewart Interview With George Carlin From 1997 Is Amazing (VIDEO)|publisher=The Huffington Post|author=Horowitz, Alana|date=April 7, 2013|accessdate=September 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Daily Show''===
In 1999, Stewart began hosting ''[[The Daily Show]]'' on [[Comedy Central]] when [[Craig Kilborn]] left the show to replace [[Tom Snyder]] on ''[[The Late Late Show (CBS TV series)|The Late Late Show]]''. The show blends humor with the day's top news stories, usually in politics, while simultaneously poking fun at politicians and many newsmakers as well as the news media itself. In an interview on ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]'', Stewart denied the show has any intentional political agenda, saying the goal was "schnicks and giggles." "The same weakness that drove me into comedy also informs my show," meaning that he was uncomfortable talking without hearing the audience laugh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=April 23, 2008|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5pK7sK0i4A|title=Jon Stewart on The O'Reilly Factor|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Stewart does not offer us cynicism for its own sake, but as a playful way to offer the kinds of insights that are not permitted in more serious news formats that slavishly cling to official account of events."&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, Lance W. "Relief in Hard Times: A Defense of Jon Stweart's Comedy in an Age of Cynicism." Critical Studies in Media Communication. 24.3 (2007): 278-283. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Until Trevor Noah permanently took over the show, Stewart hosted almost all airings of the program, except for a few occasions when correspondents such as [[Stephen Colbert]], [[Rob Corddry]], [[Jason Jones (actor)|Jason Jones]] and [[Steve Carell]] subbed for him, and during [[John Oliver (comedian)|John Oliver]]'s stint as host during the summer of 2013. Stewart has won a total of twenty [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s for ''The Daily Show'' as either a writer or producer, and two for producing ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' (2013—2014), winning a total of twenty-two Primetime Emmy Awards, having the most wins for a male individual.&lt;ref name="awards1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Jon Stewart Comedic Genres|publisher=Salon|url=http://www.salon.com/2015/11/24/trevor_noahs_just_not_funny_the_daily_show_is_a_trainwreck_i_know_because_i_watch_for_a_living/|date=November 24, 2015|accessdate=January 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, Stewart and ''The Daily Show'' received the [[Grammy Award]] for [[Best Comedy Album]] for the audio book edition of ''[[America (The Book)|America (The Book): A Citizen's Guide to Democracy Inaction]]''. In 2000 and 2004, the show won two [[Peabody Award]]s for its coverage of the presidential elections relevant to those years, called "[[Comedy Central's Indecision 2000|Indecision 2000]]" and "[[The Daily Show: Indecision 2004|Indecision 2004]]", respectively.&lt;ref name="peabodyawards2000"&gt;[http://www.peabodyawards.com/award-profile/the-daily-show-with-jon-stewart-indecision-2000 60th Annual Peabody Awards], May 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peabodyawards.com/award-profile/the-daily-show-with-jon-stewart-indecision-2004 64th Annual Peabody Awards], May 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The show of September 20, 2001, the first show after the [[attacks of September 11, 2001]], began with no introduction.&lt;ref name="DS091101"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://thedailyshow.cc.com/videos/1q93jy/september-11--2001|title = September 11, 2001|publisher = [[Comedy Central]]|date = September 11, 2001|accessdate = September 1, 2015|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150901110549/http://thedailyshow.cc.com/videos/1q93jy/september-11--2001|archivedate = September 1, 2015|dead-url = no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before this, the introduction included footage of a fly-in towards the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] and New York City. The first nine minutes of the show included a tearful Stewart discussing his personal view on the event. His remarks ended as follows:
:"The view ... from my apartment ... was the World Trade Center ... and now it's gone, and they attacked it. This symbol of American ingenuity, and strength, and labor, and imagination and commerce, and it is gone. But you know what the view is now? The [[Statue of Liberty]]. The view from the [[Lower Manhattan|South of Manhattan]] is now the Statue of Liberty. You can't beat that."&lt;ref name="DS091101"/&gt;

In mid-2002, amid rumors that [[David Letterman]] was going to switch from CBS to ABC when his contract ran out, Stewart was rumored as Letterman's replacement on CBS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hiatt|first=Brian|title=David Letterman will stay at CBS|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,216668,00.html|publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=March 11, 2002|accessdate=March 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, Letterman renewed his contract with CBS. On the March 9, 2002, episode of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', hosted by Stewart, a "[[Weekend Update]]" sketch poked fun at the situation.

In late 2002, ABC offered Stewart his own talk show to air right before ''[[Nightline (U.S. news program)|Nightline]].'' Stewart's contract with ''The Daily Show'' was near expiring, and he expressed strong interest. ABC, however, decided to give another [[Comedy Central]] figure, [[Jimmy Kimmel]], the pre-''Nightline'' slot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Carter, Bill|url=http://jon.happyjoyfun.net/tran/2002/02_1103nytimes.html|title=In the Land of the Insomniac, the Narcoleptic Wants to Be King|work=The New York Times|date=November 3, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 4, 2006, Stewart confronted [[U.S. Senator]] [[John McCain]] about his decision to appear at [[Liberty University]], an institution founded by [[Jerry Falwell]], whom McCain had previously denounced as one of the "agents of intolerance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/Politics/story?id=1843506|title=Making Right Turn, McCain Embraces Falwell|publisher=[[ABC News]]|date=April 14, 2006|accessdate=October 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lincmad.blogspot.com/2006/04/john-mccain-on-daily-show.html|title=John McCain on The Daily Show|accessdate=July 26, 2006|last=Madison|first=Lincoln|date=April 5, 2006|work=The Third Path|publisher=Blogspot}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the interchange, Stewart asked McCain, "You're not freaking out on us? Are you freaking out on us, because if you're freaking out and you're going into the crazy [[Base (politics)|base]] world—are you going into crazy base world?" McCain replied, "I'm afraid so." The clip was played on [[CNN]] and created a surge of articles across the [[blogosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Candy Crowley]]|author2=[[Wolf Blitzer]] |url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0605/15/sitroom.01.html|title=Transcripts: The Situation Room|work=[[The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer|The Situation Room]]|publisher=CNN|date=March 15, 2006|accessdate=July 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=April 4, 2006|url=http://www.thedailyshow.com/video/index.jhtml?videoId=115528&amp;title=john-mccain|title=John McCain on The Daily Show|publisher=[[Comedy Central]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, ''The Daily Show'' was involved in former correspondent [[Stephen Colbert presidential campaign, 2008|Stephen Colbert's announcement that he would run for president in 2008]]. In 2008, Stewart appeared on the news program ''[[Democracy Now!]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2008/9/1/jon_stewart_of_the_daily_show|title="Jon Stewart of "The Daily Show" Weighs in on Sarah Palin, Hurricane Gustav and the Media's Coverage of the Conventions"|date=September 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2008 ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' story questioned whether he was, in a phrase originally used to describe longtime network news anchor [[Walter Cronkite]], "the most trusted man in America".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/17/arts/television/17kaku.html|work=The New York Times|title=Is Jon Stewart the Most Trusted Man in America?|date=August 15, 2008|first=Michiko|last=Kakutani}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 28, 2009, during a discussion on [[torture]] with [[Clifford May]], Stewart expressed his opinion that former President [[Harry S. Truman]] was a [[war crimes|war criminal]] for his [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|use of the atomic bomb on Japan during World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theweek.com/article/index/96152/Jon_Stewarts_apology_to_Harry_Truman|title=Jon Stewart's apology to Harry Truman|publisher=The Week|accessdate=September 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dennis-perrin/why-did-jon-stewart-apolo_b_195147.html|title=Dennis Perrin: Why Did Jon Stewart Apologize?|publisher=Huffingtonpost.com|date=May 3, 2009|accessdate=September 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moments later, Stewart defended his assertion:
"Here's what I think of the [[atom bomb]]s. I think if you dropped an atom bomb fifteen miles offshore and you said, 'The next one's coming and hitting you', then I would think it's okay. To drop it on a city, and kill a hundred thousand people. Yeah. I think that's criminal." On April 30, 2009, Stewart apologized on his program, and stated he did not believe Truman was a war criminal:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/thu-april-30-2009/harry-truman-was-not-a-war-criminal|title=Harry Truman Was Not a War Criminal - Video Clip &amp;#124; Comedy Central|work=The Daily Show|date=April 30, 2009|accessdate=August 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; "I shouldn't have said that, and I did. So I say right now, no, I don't believe that to be the case. The atomic bomb, a very complicated decision in the context of a horrific war, and I walk that back because it was in my estimation a stupid thing to say."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hnn.us/roundup/entries/81745.html|title=History News Network|publisher=Hnn.us|date=May 3, 2009|accessdate=September 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2010, [[Comedy Central]] renewed Stewart's contract to host ''The Daily Show'' into 2013.&lt;ref name="Stelter"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/24/arts/television/24stewart.html?scp=2&amp;sq=jon%20stewart&amp;st=cse|title=Jon Stewart's Punching Bag, Fox News|last=Stelter|first=Brian|date=April 23, 2010|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=April 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=salary&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=April 23, 2008|url=http://nymag.com/guides/salary/14497/index1.html|title=Who Makes How Much|publisher=[[New York magazine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Forbes]] list of Celebrities in 2008, he was earning $14 million a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=July 22, 2008|url=https://www.forbes.com/lists/2008/53/celebrities08_Jon-Stewart_JZY4.html|title=The Celebrity 100|publisher=[[Forbes.com]]|date=June 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 16, 2010, Stewart and [[Stephen Colbert]] announced a rally for October 30, known as the [[Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear]]. It took place on the [[National Mall]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] and attracted an estimated 215,000 participants.&lt;ref name=cbs-rally&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20021284-503544.html|work=CBS News|title=Jon Stewart Rally Attracts Estimated 215,000|first=Brian|last=Montopoli|date=October 30, 2010|accessdate=December 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2010, Stewart was credited by the [[White House]] and other media and political news outlets for bringing awareness of the Republican [[filibuster]] on the [[James Zadroga]] 9/11 Health and Compensation Act to the public, leading to the ultimate passing of the bill which provides health benefits to first responders whose health has been adversely affected by their work at [[Ground Zero]].&lt;ref name="cbs-zadroga"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20026333-503544.html|title=White House Lauds Jon Stewart for Pushing Passage of 9/11 Health Bill|last=Madison|first=Lucy|date=December 24, 2010|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=December 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The New York Times]]'' opined that he is "the modern-day equivalent of [[Edward R.

On July 14, 2014, Stewart interviewed [[Hillary Clinton]] about the Middle East. Clinton's condemnations of Hamas led Stewart to ask her: "But don't you think they would look at that though as, they've given a lot of different things a chance and these are the only guys to them that are giving any resistance to what their condition is?” For Gazans living in that situation, he said Hamas could be viewed as "freedom fighters".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tabletmag.com/scroll/179536/watch-hillary-clinton-vs-jon-stewart-on-gaza%20%20our%20freedom%20fighters Hillary Clinton vs Jon Stewart on Gaza], tabletmag.com; accessed September 23, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediaite.com/tv/jon-stewart-confronts-hillary-over-humanitarian-crisis-in-gaza Jon Stewart confronts Hillary Clinton over Gaza]&lt;/ref&gt; On August 1, 2014, Stewart stated on air that "We cannot be Israel's rehab sponsor and its drug dealer".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gcngu9wkCzE YouTube]; accessed September 23, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.algemeiner.com/2014/12/02/jon-stewarts-betrayal-of-israel/# Jon Stewart's betrayal of Israel], algemeiner.com, December 2, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

HBO programming president Casey Bloys has said that “the idea is it will be an animated parody of a cable news network with an ''Onion''-like portal.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/hbos-new-chief-talks-jon-915930|title=HBO's New Chief Talks Jon Stewart, 'Vinyl' Demise, Violence Problems and 'Thrones' End|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=May 21, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team is currently working with cloud graphics company [[OTOY]] to build out a system for creating content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://decider.com/2017/03/14/jon-stewart-hbo-writing-staff-free-comedy-red-bank-new-jersey/|title=The Staff Of Jon Stewart’s Mysterious New HBO Show Is Testing Out Material In Suburban New Jersey|last=Marotta|first=Jenna|date=March 14, 2017|website=Decider|access-date=May 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Confirmed to be working on the project are Mike Brown, Steve Waltien, Chelsea Devantez, Lucy Steiner, Kate James, and Robby Slowik.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://decider.com/2017/03/14/jon-stewart-hbo-writing-staff-free-comedy-red-bank-new-jersey/|title=The Staff Of Jon Stewart’s Mysterious New HBO Show Is Testing Out Material In Suburban New Jersey|date=March 14, 2017|website=Decider {{!}} Where To Stream Movies &amp; Shows on Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Instant, HBO Go|access-date=May 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team tested out material in Red Bank, New Jersey at The [[Count Basie Theatre]] Performing Arts Academy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The cancelation statement read: &lt;blockquote&gt;"HBO and Jon Stewart have decided not to proceed with a shortform digital animated project. [...] We all thought the project had great potential but there were technical issues in terms of production and distribution that proved too difficult given the quick turnaround and topical nature of the material. We’re excited to report that we have some future projects together which you will be hearing about in the near future.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

In July 2017, HBO announced Stewart would produce a stand-up comedy special for the network, his first stand-up special since 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Yvonne Villarreal |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-two-jon-stewart-comedy-specials-are-1501109085-htmlstory.html |title=Two Jon Stewart comedy specials are coming to HBO |publisher=Latimes.com |date= |accessdate=August 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writings===
[[File:Jon Stewart Earth book 2 Shankbone.jpg|thumb|upright|Stewart at the launch of his book, ''[[Earth (The Book)]]'', in New York, September 27, 2010]] In 1998, Stewart released his first book, ''[[Naked Pictures of Famous People]]'', a collection of humorous short stories and essays. The book reached [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller List]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Naked-Pictures-Famous-People-Stewart/dp/0688171621 |title=Naked Pictures of Famous People |publisher=Amazon.com |date=September 22, 1999 |accessdate=September 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Stewart and ''The Daily Show'' writing staff released ''[[America (The Book)|America (The Book): A Citizen's Guide to Democracy Inaction]],'' a mock [[high school]] [[History]] [[textbook]] offering insights into the unique American system of government, dissecting its institutions, explaining its history and processes, and satirizing such popular American political precepts as "[[one man, one vote]]", "government by the people," and "every vote counts." The book sold millions of copies upon its 2004 release and ended the year as a top-fifteen best seller.&lt;ref name="Top15books2004"/&gt;

In 2005, Stewart provided the voice of President [[James A. Garfield]] for the audiobook version of [[Sarah Vowell]]'s ''[[Assassination Vacation]]''.&lt;ref name="ref3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://books.simonandschuster.com/Assassination-Vacation/Sarah-Vowell/9780743260046|title=Simon &amp; Schuster's ''Assassination Vacation'' Audio Book Promo page|accessdate=December 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Stewart voiced a role on [[Stephen Colbert]]'s audiobook version of ''[[I Am America (And So Can You!)]]''. He plays Mort Sinclaire, former TV comedy writer and Communist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Solomon | first = Deborah | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/25/magazine/25questions.html?_r=2&amp;oref=slogin | title = Funny About the News |work=New York Times Magazine | date = September 25, 2005 | accessdate = January 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Stewart and ''The Daily Show'' writing staff released a sequel to their first book called ''[[Earth (The Book)|Earth (The Book): A Visitor's Guide to the Human Race]]''. The book is meant to serve as a [[Baedeker]] travel guide for an alien civilization that discovers Earth after humanity has died out, most likely by its own hands.&lt;ref name="ew1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20419670,00.html|title=Earth (The Book) (2010)|last=Staskiewicz|first=Keith|date=September 8, 2010|publisher=''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''|accessdate=September 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acting===
Although best known for his work on ''[[The Daily Show]],'' Stewart has had roles in several [[film]]s and [[television program|television series]]. His first film role was a bit part in the box-office bomb ''[[Mixed Nuts]].'' He landed a minor part in ''[[The First Wives Club]]'', but his [[deleted scene|scene was deleted]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jon.happyjoyfun.net/tran/1990/96_0827usatoday.html|title=Out of the Club|publisher=USA Today|author1=Vigoda, Arlene |author2=Susan Wloszczyna |date=August 27, 1996|accessdate=June 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, Stewart signed a three-year deal with [[Miramax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,299594,00.html|work=Entertainment Weekly|title=Monitor|date=November 17, 1995|accessdate=March 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played romantic leads in the films ''[[Playing by Heart]]'' and ''[[Wishful Thinking (1997 film)|Wishful Thinking]]''. He had a supporting role in the romantic comedy ''[[Since You've Been Gone (film)|Since You've Been Gone]]'' and in the horror film ''[[The Faculty]]''. Other films were planned for Stewart to write and star in, but they were never produced. Stewart has since maintained a relationship with Miramax founders [[Harvey Weinstein|Harvey]] and [[Bob Weinstein]] and continues to appear in films they have produced including ''[[Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back]]'', ''[[Doogal]]'' and the documentary ''[[Wordplay (film)|Wordplay]]''.

He appeared in ''[[Half Baked]]'' as an "enhancement smoker" and in ''[[Big Daddy (1999 film)|Big Daddy]]'' as [[Adam Sandler]]'s roommate; he has joked on the ''Daily Show'' and in the documentary ''[[The Aristocrats (film)|The Aristocrats]]'' that to get the role he slept with Sandler. Stewart often makes fun of his appearances in the high-profile [[Box office bomb|flop]] ''[[Death to Smoochy]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2006-02-19-jon-stewart_x.htm?POE=LIFISVA|title=Jon Stewart looks Oscar in the eye|publisher=USA Today|author=Levin, Gary|date=February 19, 2006|accessdate=June 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he played a treacherous television executive, and the animated film ''[[Doogal]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0602/27/lkl.01.html|title=CNN Larry King Live: Interview With Jon Stewart|work=[[Larry King Live]]|publisher=CNN|date=February 27, 2006|accessdate=June 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he played a blue [[Spring (device)|spring]] named Zeebad who shot a freeze ray from his mustache. In 2007, Stewart made a [[cameo appearance]] as himself in ''[[Evan Almighty]]'', which starred former ''Daily Show'' correspondent [[Steve Carell]]. In the movie, Stewart was seen on a television screen in a fictional ''Daily Show'' episode poking fun at Carell's character for building an [[Noah's Ark|ark]].

Stewart had a recurring role in ''[[The Larry Sanders Show]]'', playing himself as an occasional substitute and possible successor to late-night talk show host [[List of The Larry Sanders Show characters|Larry Sanders]] (played by [[Garry Shandling]]). In 1998, Stewart hosted the television special, ''[[Elmopalooza]]'', celebrating 30 years of ''[[Sesame Street]]''. He has guest-starred on other sitcoms including ''[[The Nanny]]'', ''[[Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist]]'', ''[[Spin City]]'', ''[[NewsRadio]]'', ''[[American Dad!]]'', and ''[[The Simpsons]]''. He has also made guest appearances on the [[children's television series]] ''[[Between the Lions]]'', ''[[Sesame Street]]'', ''[[Jack's Big Music Show]]'', and ''[[Gravity Falls]]''.

===Producing===
In the mid-1990s, Stewart launched his own [[production company]], [[Busboy Productions]], naming the company in reference to his previous job as a [[busboy]]. Stewart signed a deal with [[Miramax]] to develop projects through his company, but none of his ideas have been produced. After Stewart's success as host and producer of ''The Daily Show'', he revived Busboy Productions with ''Daily Show'' producers [[Ben Karlin]] and Rich Korson. In 2002, Busboy planned to produce a [[sitcom]] for NBC starring Stephen Colbert, but the show did not come to fruition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jon Stewart: TV Mogul|publisher=[[E! Online]]|date=February 15, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, [[Comedy Central]] reached an agreement with Busboy in which Comedy Central would provide financial backing for the production company. Comedy Central has a first-look agreement on all projects, after which Busboy is free to shop them to other networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/services/business-services-miscellaneous-business/4762101-1.html|title=Comedy Inks Deal with Stewart's Busboy|author=Larson, Megan|publisher=[[Adweek]]|date=February 18, 2005|accessdate=October 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/feb/16/entertainment/et-stewart16|title=Jon Stewart, Comedy Central Sign Deal|author=Boucher, Geoff|publisher=The Los Angeles Times|date=February 18, 2005|accessdate=October 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The deal spawned the ''Daily Show'' [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' and its replacement ''[[The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore]]''. Other projects include the sitcom [[television pilot|pilot]] ''[[Three Strikes (TV series)|Three Strikes]]'', the [[documentary film|documentary]] ''Sportsfan'', the series ''[[Important Things with Demetri Martin]]'', and the film ''The Donor''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3iff0ec139962d42d4152b670707cce783 |title=Stewart stamp on 'Martin' |publisher=Hollywoodreporter.com |date=October 3, 2007 |accessdate=February 16, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516180516/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3iff0ec139962d42d4152b670707cce783 |archivedate=May 16, 2008  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Stewart's departure from ''The Daily Show'', he was listed as an executive producer on ''[[The Late Show with Stephen Colbert]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2015/09/09/media/jon-stewart-producer-stephen-colbert|title=Jon Stewart is one of Stephen Colbert's 'Late Show' producers|date=September 9, 2015|work=CNN Money|accessdate=September 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Directing===
In March 2010, Stewart announced that he had optioned rights to the story of journalist [[Maziar Bahari]], who was imprisoned in [[Iran]] for 118 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/optioned-stories-jon-stewart-buys-a-journalists-tale-don-murphy-takes-cory-doctorows-latest-novel/|title=Optioned Stories: Jon Stewart Buys a Journalist's Tale; Don Murphy Takes Cory Doctorow's Latest Novel|accessdate=June 8, 2011|publisher=Slashfilm}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the June 6, 2011 episode of ''The Daily Show'', Stewart again hosted Bahari, and in March 2013, he announced that he was leaving the show for 12 weeks to direct the film version of Bahari's 2011 book ''Then They Came For Me.''

On directing, Stewart noted on Lazarus's show that "The Daily Show" influenced his directing process more than his acting gigs did. He said, "It's about the collaboration. It's about understanding. Doing a show taught me this process of clarity of vision, but flexibility of process. So know your intention, know where you're wanting to go with the scene with the way that you want it to go, the momentum shifts, the emphasis, where you want it to be."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/features/jon-stewart-is-ready-for-next-iteration-of-the-daily-show-20150220#ixzz3SxWwIEKR|title=Jon Stewart Is Ready for 'Next Iteration' of 'Daily Show' - Rolling Stone|work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=March 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also expressed interest in directing more films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lewis|first1=Hilary|last2=Simmons|first2=Ted|title=Jon Stewart Reveals Hopes For 'Daily Show' Successor, Talks Future Plans|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/jon-stewart-reveals-hopes-daily-775586|website=Hollywood Reporter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hosting and public speaking===
Stewart has hosted the [[Grammy Award]]s twice, in 2001 and in 2002,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/news/jon-stewart-ll-cool-j-who-has-hosted-grammys|title=Who has hosted the GRAMMYs?|date=February 8, 2013|work=GRAMMY.com|access-date=December 9, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[78th Academy Awards]], which were held March 5 at the [[Kodak Theatre]] in [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jon Stewart to Host Oscars|publisher=CBS|date=January 5, 2006|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/01/05/entertainment/main1180403.shtml|accessdate=July 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critical response to Stewart's performance was mixed. [[Roger Ebert]] compared him favorably to legendary Oscar host [[Johnny Carson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060305/OSCARS/60306001|author=Ebert, Roger|title='Crash'-ing a joyous Oscar party|website=RogerEbert.com|date=March 5, 2006|accessdate=May 7, 2007|authorlink= Roger Ebert}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other reviewers were less positive; [[Tom Shales]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' said that Stewart hosted with "smug humorlessness." James Poniewozik of ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'' said that Stewart was a bad host, but a great "anti-host" in that he poked fun at parts of the broadcast that deserved it, which lent him a degree of authenticity with the non-[[Hollywood]] audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Poniewozik|first=James|title=Jon Stewart vs. The Oscars|work=[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]|date=March 6, 2006|url=http://www.time-blog.com/tuned_in/2006/03/jon_stewart_vs_the_oscars.html|accessdate=July 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stewart and correspondent [[John Oliver (comedian)|John Oliver]] later poked fun at his lackluster reception on ''The Daily Show''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s coverage of the [[79th Academy Awards]] by saying that the "[[demon]] of last year's Oscars had finally been [[exorcism|exorcised]]."

Stewart returned to host the [[80th Academy Awards]] on February 24, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=February 25, 2008|work=The New York Times|title=Reviewing Jon Stewart's Starring Role|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/25/arts/television/25watc.html?gwh=EC81FFF8935496C150A62FEFC2527521|first=Alessandra|last=Stanley}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reception to his performance was better received. Matthew Gilbert of the ''[[Boston Globe]]'' felt the ceremony itself was average but praised Stewart, writing that, "It was good to see Jon Stewart being Jon Stewart. He is shaping up to be a dependable Oscar host for the post-Billy Crystal years. He's not musical, but he's versatile enough to swing smoothly between jokes about politics, Hollywood, new media, and, most importantly, hair."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gilbert|first1=Matthew|title=Looking back doesn't help show look good|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/movies/oscars/articles/2008/02/25/looking_back_doesnt_help_show_look_good/|accessdate=September 21, 2008|work=Boston.com|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=February 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' columnist Brian Lowry lauded Stewart's performance noting that he "earned his keep by maintaining a playful, irreverent tone throughout the night, whether it was jesting about [[Cate Blanchett]]’s versatility or watching ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]'' on an [[iPhone]] screen.&lt;ref name="Variety Oscar"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2008/film/reviews/the-80th-annual-academy-awards-from-your-couch-1200547810/|title=The 80th Annual Academy Awards -- From Your Couch | last = Lowry | first=Brian | date=February 24, 2008 | work = Variety|publisher=PMC| accessdate = February 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2009, Stewart gave a speech at the [[John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts]] honoring [[Bruce Springsteen]], one of that year's [[Kennedy Center Honors]] recipients, and of whom Stewart is a fan.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/bruce-springsteen-honored-at-kennedy-center-by-mellencamp-vedder-sting-20091230 "Bruce Springsteen Honored at Kennedy Center By Mellencamp, Vedder, Sting"].

Stewart began a comedic feud with [[WWE]] wrestler [[Seth Rollins]] in March 2015, and appeared on ''[[WWE Raw]]'' during a ''Daily Show''-styled segment hosted by Rollins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/wwe-raw-jon-stewart-delivers-jersey-justice-20150303|title='WWE Raw': Jon Stewart Delivers Jersey Justice|first=Kenny|last=Herzog|work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=August 30, 2015|date=March 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 23, 2015, Stewart returned to host the WWE's [[SummerSlam (2015)|SummerSlam]] at the [[Barclays Center]] in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2015/08/17/exclusive-jon-stewart-host-wwe-summerslam/31858675/|title=Exclusive: Jon Stewart to host WWE SummerSlam|last=Truitt|first=Brian|date=August 18, 2015|work=USA Today|accessdate=August 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He would later get involved in the main event between Rollins and [[John Cena]], helping Rollins retain his [[WWE Championship|WWE World Heavyweight Championship]], as well as winning Cena's [[WWE United States Championship|United States Championship]]. The next night on ''Raw'', he explained his actions, saying he did it for [[Ric Flair]] (who was also present), which was to retain his [[world heavyweight championship (professional wrestling)|world championship]] record. Cena then gave Stewart his finishing move, the Attitude Adjustment, to end the segment. Stewart returned at [[SummerSlam (2016)|SummerSlam]] on August 21, 2016 as a special guest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hanstock|first1=Bill|title=Jon Stewart Will Once Again Appear At WWE SummerSlam|url=http://uproxx.com/prowrestling/wwe-summerslam-2016-jon-stewart-special-guest/|work=Uproxx|accessdate=August 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stewart got into a [[Twitter]] war with then-candidate [[Donald Trump]], who in multiple tweets equated Stewart's changing his name from his birth name indicated that Stewart was a fraud. Stewart and some analysts considered this to be [[anti-Semitic]]. As Trump tweeted that Stewart should be "proud of his heritage", Stewart tweeted back, facetiously that Trump's real name was "Fuckface Von Clownstick" and that Trump should be proud of the "Clownstick heritage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/jon-stewart-calls-action-against-trump-colbert-551226|title=Jon Stewart thinks Trump can make America great...just not the way you might think|date=February 1, 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gq.com/story/jon-stewart-donald-trump-burns|title=Jon Stewart's Latest Donald Trump Burns Will Make You Really, Really Miss Jon Stewart|first=Rohan|last=Nadkarni|date=May 10, 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2015/06/17/jon_stewarts_dream_just_came_true_donald_trump_running_is_a_gift_from_heaven/|title=Jon Stewart’s dream just came true: Donald Trump running is a "gift from heaven"|first=Colin|last=Gorenstein|date=June 17, 2015|website=Salon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a televised exchange with then-CNN correspondent [[Tucker Carlson]] on ''[[Crossfire (TV series)|Crossfire]]'' on October 15, 2004, Stewart criticized the state of television journalism and pleaded with the show's hosts to "stop hurting America", and referred to both Carlson and co-host [[Paul Begala]] as "[[Partisan (political)|partisan]] hacks".&lt;ref name="CNN041015" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people=Jon Stewart, Tucker Carlson|title=[[Crossfire (TV series)|Crossfire]]|medium=Television|publisher=CNN|date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; When posted on the internet, this exchange became widely viewed and was a topic of much media discussion.

Despite being on the program to comment on current events, Stewart immediately shifted the discussion toward the show itself, asserting that ''Crossfire'' had failed in its responsibility to inform and educate viewers about politics as a serious topic. Stewart stated that the show engaged in partisan hackery instead of honest debate, and said that the hosts' assertion that ''Crossfire'' is a debate show is like "saying [[professional wrestling|pro wrestling]] is a show about athletic competition." Carlson responded by saying that Stewart criticizes news organizations for not holding public officials accountable, but when he interviewed [[John Kerry]], Stewart asked a series of "softball" questions (Stewart has acknowledged he voted for Kerry in the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential election]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/story/2008/08/25/ST2008082503384.html|title=No Joke: Jon Stewart Takes Aim At 24-Hour Cable News 'Beast'|publisher=washingtonpost.com |date=August 25, 2008|accessdate=September 17, 2010|first=Howard|last=Kurtz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stewart responded that he didn't realize "the news organizations look to ''[[Comedy Central]]'' for their cues on integrity." When Carlson continued to press Stewart on the Kerry issue, Stewart said, "You're on CNN! The show that leads into me is [[Crank Yankers|puppets making crank phone calls]]! What is wrong with you?" In response to prods from Carlson, "Come on. Be funny," Stewart said, "No, I'm not going to be your monkey." Later in the show when Carlson jibed, "I do think you're more fun on your show," Stewart retorted, "You're as big a dick on your show as you are on any show." In response to Stewart's criticisms, Carlson said, "You need to get a job at a journalism school," to which Stewart responded, "You need to go to one!"&lt;ref name="CNN041015" /&gt;

Stewart discussed the incident on ''The Daily Show'' the following Monday:
{{quote|We decided to go to this place, ''Crossfire'', which is a ''nuanced'' public policy analysis show… named after [[Crossfire|the stray bullets that hit innocent bystanders in a gang fight]]. So I go to ''Crossfire'' and, let's face it, I was dehydrated, it's the [[Martin Lawrence#Legal issues and health problems|Martin Lawrence]] defense… and I had always in the past mentioned to friends and people that I meet on the street that I think that show… um… blows. So I thought it was only the right thing to do to go say it to them personally on their program, but here's the thing about confronting someone with that on their show: They're ''there!'' Un''com''fortable! And they were very mad, because apparently, when you invite someone on a show called ''Crossfire'' and you express an opinion, they don't care for that… I told them that I felt their show was hurting America and they came back at me pretty good, they said that I wasn't being funny. And I said to them, "I know that, but tomorrow I will go back to being funny, and your show will still blow."&lt;ref name="serious"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Stewart, Jon|title=Your Show Blows|publisher=[[Comedy Central]]|date=October 18, 2004|url=http://thedailyshow.cc.com/videos/mr122o/your-show-blows|accessdate=December 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In January 2005, CNN announced that it was canceling ''Crossfire''. When asked about the cancellation, CNN's incoming president, [[Jonathan Klein (CNN)|Jonathan Klein]], referenced Stewart's appearance on the show: "I think he made a good point about the noise level of these types of shows, which does nothing to illuminate the issues of the day."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Howard Kurtz]]|title=Carlson &amp; 'Crossfire,' Exit Stage Left &amp; Right|publisher=Washington Post|date=January 6, 2004|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A52274-2005Jan6.html|accessdate=July 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 18, 2009, Carlson wrote a blog entry for ''[[The Daily Beast]]'' criticizing Stewart for his handling of the CNBC controversy (see below). Carlson discussed the CNN incident and claimed that Stewart remained backstage for at least "an hour" and "continued to lecture our staff", something Carlson described as "one of the weirdest things I have ever seen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Tucker|last=Carlson|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2009-03-18/how-jon-stewart-went-bad|title=How Jon Stewart Went Bad|date=March 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism of CNBC===
{{Main article|Jon Stewart's 2009 criticism of CNBC}}
Stewart again became a [[Viral phenomenon|viral internet phenomenon]] following a March 4, 2009, ''The Daily Show'' sequence. CNBC canceled [[Rick Santelli]]'s scheduled appearance but Stewart still ran a short segment showing CNBC giving bad investment advice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jason Linkins|title=Jon Stewart Eviscerates CNBC, Santelli On Daily Show|publisher=The Huffington Post|date=March 5, 2009|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/03/05/jon-stewart-eviscerates-c_n_172057.html|accessdate=March 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent media coverage of exchanges between [[Jim Cramer]], who had been featured heavily in the original segment, and Stewart, led to a highly anticipated face-to-face confrontation on ''The Daily Show''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Matea Gold|title=Exclusive: Jim Cramer set to appear on ''The Daily Show'' Thursday|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=March 10, 2009|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2009/03/exclusive-jim-c.html|accessdate=March 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The episode received much media attention and became the second most-viewed episode of ''The Daily Show'', trailing only the 2009 Inauguration Day episode. It had 2.3 million total viewers, and the next day, the show's website saw its highest day of traffic in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jon Lafayette|title=Stewart-Cramer Confrontation Draws 'Daily's' Second-Biggest Audience of '09|publisher=TVWeek.com|date=March 13, 2009|url=http://www.tvweek.com/news/2009/03/stewartcramer_confrontation_dr.php|accessdate=March 14, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090315003518/http://www.tvweek.com/news/2009/03/stewartcramer_confrontation_dr.php|archivedate=March 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Cramer acknowledged on the show that some of Stewart's criticisms of CNBC were valid and that the network could "do better," he later said on ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|The Today Show]]'' that Stewart's criticism of the media was "naïve and misleading."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Calderon|first=Michael|title=Cramer slams Stewart: 'naive and misleading'|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/michaelcalderone/0309/Cramer_slams_Stewart_naive_and_misleading.html|publisher=[[The Politico]]|date=March 19, 2009|accessdate=March 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism of Fox News===
Throughout his tenure on ''The Daily Show'', Stewart has frequently accused [[Fox News]] of distorting the news to fit a [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] agenda, at one point ridiculing the network as "the meanest sorority in the world."&lt;ref name="Huffington Post"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/03/12/stewart-fox-news-is-the-m_n_496403.html|title=Stewart: Fox News Is The Meanest Sorority In The World|date=March 12, 2010|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=April 25, 2010|first=Dan|last=Abramson}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2009, Stewart called out Fox News for using some footage from a previous [[Tea Party movement|Tea Party]] rally during a report on a more recent rally, making the latter event appear more highly attended than it actually was. The show's anchor, [[Sean Hannity]], apologized for the footage use the following night.&lt;ref name="Hong"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blog.seattlepi.com/thebigblog/archives/184866.asp|title=Video Fix: Jon Stewart catches Fox News using wrong footage|last=Hong|first=Sharon|date=November 11, 2009|publisher=Seattle PI|accessdate=April 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A month later, Stewart criticized ''[[Fox &amp; Friends]]'' cohost [[Gretchen Carlson]]&amp;nbsp;– a former [[Miss America]] and a [[Stanford]] graduate&amp;nbsp;– for claiming that she [[google]]d words such as "ignoramus" and "czar". Stewart said that Carlson was dumbing herself down for "an audience who sees intellect as an elitist flaw".&lt;ref name="Carlson episode"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/tue-december-8-2009/gretchen-carlson-dumbs-down|date=December 8, 2009|work=The Daily Show|title=Gretchen Carlson Dumbs Down|accessdate=April 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stewart stepped up his criticism of Fox News in 2010; as of April 24, ''The Daily Show'' had 24 segments criticizing Fox News' coverage.&lt;ref name="Stelter"/&gt; [[Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]], host of the talk show ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]'' on Fox News, countered that ''The Daily Show'' was a "key component of left-wing television" and that Stewart loved Fox News because the network was "not boring".&lt;ref name="Stelter"/&gt;

During an interview with [[Chris Wallace]] on June 19, 2011, Stewart called Wallace "insane" after Wallace said that Stewart's earlier comparison of a Sarah Palin campaign video and an anti-herpes medicine ad was a political comment. Stewart also said Fox viewers are the "most consistently misinformed" viewers of political media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/06/19/jon-stewart-fox-news-sunday-video_n_879964.html |title=Jon Stewart LIVE On Fox News, Tells Host 'You're Insane' (VIDEO) [UPDATE&amp;#93; |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |accessdate=September 16, 2012 |date=June 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This comment was ranked by fact-checking site [[PolitiFact]] as false, with conditions. Stewart later accepted his error.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jun/20/jon-stewart/jon-stewart-says-those-who-watch-fox-news-are-most|title=Jon Stewart says those who watch Fox News are the "most consistently misinformed media viewers"|publisher=PolitiFact|accessdate=August 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Stewart engaged in an extended "call-out" of Fox News based on their perceived hypocritical coverage of [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program|food stamps]] and U.S. Government assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thedailyshow.cc.com/videos/v9wjc4/fox-news-welfare-academy|title=Fox News Welfare Academy - The Daily Show - Video Clip|publisher=Thedailyshow.cc.com|date=March 13, 2014|accessdate=August 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This culminated during the [[Bundy standoff]] involving multiple segments, across multiple episodes, specifically singling out [[Sean Hannity]] and Hannity's coverage of the event. Hannity would "return fire" by calling out Stewart for associating himself with [[Cat Stevens]] during his Rally in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wemple|first=Erik|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2014/04/25/no-sean-hannity-you-cant-distance-yourself-from-cliven-bundy|title=No, Sean Hannity, you can't distance yourself from Cliven Bundy|publisher=The Washington Post|date=August 15, 2014|accessdate=August 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stewart responded to this by calling out Hannity for frequently calling [[Ted Nugent]] a "friend and frequent guest" on his program and supporting Nugent's violent rhetoric towards [[Barack Obama]] and [[Hillary Clinton]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2014/04/24/must_see_morning_clip_jon_stewart_calls_sean_hannitys_show_the_arbys_of_news|title=Must-see morning clip: Jon Stewart calls Sean Hannity's show "the Arby's of news"|publisher=Salon.com|date=April 24, 2014|accessdate=August 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late August 2014, Stewart vehemently opposed the manner in which Fox News portrayed the events surrounding the shooting of teenager Michael Brown by police officer Darren Wilson in [[Ferguson, Missouri]] and the subsequent protests from citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/daily-shows-jon-stewart-destroys-fox-news-for-its-ferguson-coverage-9697444.html|title=Daily Show's Jon Stewart destroys Fox News for its Ferguson coverage|work=The Independent|accessdate=March 13, 2015|location=London|first=Natasha|last=Culzac|date=August 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advocacy==
Stewart sometimes used ''The Daily Show'' to argue for causes such as the treatment of [[veteran]]s and [[Health effects arising from the September 11 attacks|9/11 first responders]]. He is credited with breaking a Senate deadlock over a bill to provide [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|health care]] and [[Social programs in the United States|benefits]] for 9/11 emergency workers; the bill passed three days after he featured a group of 9/11 responders on the show. In March 2009, he criticized a White House proposal to remove veterans from Veterans Administration rolls if they had private health insurance; the White House dropped the plan the next day.&lt;ref name="Samuelsohn"/&gt;

==Writers Guild of America strike of 2007–2008==
Stewart was an important factor in the unionization of the [[Comedy Central]] writers. ''The Daily Show'' writers were the first of Comedy Central's writers to be able to join the guild, after which other shows followed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=April 23, 2008|url=http://www.wga.org/subpage_newsevents.aspx?id=2387|title=Comedy Central Writers Win WGA Contract|publisher=[[Writers Guild of America|WGA]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080102203818/http://www.wga.org/subpage_newsevents.aspx?id=2387|archivedate=January 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=April 23, 2008|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/services/legal-services/4465402-1.html|title=Union Deal for 'Daily Show' Writers|publisher=AllBusiness.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stewart supported the [[2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike]]. On ''The Daily Show'' episode just before the strike, he sarcastically commented about how [[Comedy Central]] had made available all episodes for free on their website, but without advertising, and said, "go support our advertisers". The show went on hiatus when the strike began, as did other late night talk shows. Upon Stewart's return to the show on January 7, 2008, he refused to use the title ''The Daily Show'', stating that ''The Daily Show'' was the show made with all of the people responsible for the broadcast, including his writers. During the strike, he referred to his show as '''''A''' Daily Show with Jon Stewart'' until the strike ended on February 13, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=January 18, 2008|accessdate=September 4, 2016|url=http://www.today.com/id/22571544/ns/today-today_entertainment/t/colbert-stewart-make-do-without-writers/|title=Colbert, Stewart make do without writers|publisher=Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stewart's choice to return to the air did bring criticism that he was undermining the writers of his show. [[Seth MacFarlane]] wrote an inside joke into an episode of ''[[Family Guy]]'' about this, causing Stewart to respond with an hour-long call in which he questioned how MacFarlane could consider himself the "moral arbiter" of Hollywood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Morgan|first=Piers|title=Seth MacFarlane Interview|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrcOge6pMhg|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other former writers of ''The Daily Show'' such as [[David Feldman (comedian)|David Feldman]] have also indicated that Stewart was anti-union at the time and punished his writers for their decision to unionize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=David|first=Feldman|title=Former Daily Show Writer Accuses Jon Stewart of Punishing His Writers For Forming A Union|url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/camelswithhammers/2012/05/is-jon-stewart-anti-union/|publisher=Patheos|accessdate=May 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=David|first=Feldman|title=Former Daily Show Writer Accuses Jon Stewart of Punishing His Writers For Forming A Union|url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/camelswithhammers/2012/05/is-jon-stewart-anti-union|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926234305/http://www.patheos.com/blogs/camelswithhammers/2012/05/is-jon-stewart-anti-union|archivedate=September 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Writers Guild Strike of 2007–08 was also responsible for a notable mock [[The Colbert/O'Brien/Stewart feud|feud]] between Stewart, [[Stephen Colbert]], and [[Conan O'Brien]] in early 2008. Without writers to help fuel their banter, the three comedians concocted a [[fictional crossover|crossover]]/rivalry in order to garner more viewers during the ratings slump. Colbert made the claim that because of "the Colbert bump", he was responsible for [[Mike Huckabee]]'s success in the [[U.S. presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential race]]. O'Brien claimed that he was responsible for Huckabee's success because not only had he mentioned Huckabee on his show, but also that he was responsible for [[Chuck Norris]]'s success (Norris backed Huckabee). In response, Stewart claimed that he was responsible for the success of O'Brien, since Stewart had featured him on ''[[The Jon Stewart Show]]'', and in turn the success of Huckabee. This resulted in a three-part comedic battle between the three pundits, with all three appearing on each other's shows. The feud ended on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'' with a mock brawl involving the three hosts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/23017599/ Conan, Stewart, Colbert unite in TV feud], February 5, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences==
Stewart has said his influences include [[George Carlin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people=Stewart, Jon|title=[[George Carlin: 40 Years of Comedy]]|medium=TV|publisher=[[HBO]]|date=February 27, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lenny Bruce]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.duckprods.com/projects/lennybruce/lb-nytimesfeature.html|title=There Was Thought in His Rage|work=The New York Times|author=Keepnews, Peter|date=August 8, 1999|accessdate=June 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Letterman]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people=Stewart, Jon|title=The 57th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards|medium=TV|publisher=[[CBS]]|date=September 18, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Steve Martin]],&lt;ref name="CNN020322"/&gt; and [[Richard Pryor]].&lt;ref name=moment/&gt;

Stewart and ''The Daily Show'' received the 2005 [[National Council of Teachers of English]] (NCTE) [[Orwell Award|George Orwell Award for Distinguished Contribution to Honesty and Clarity in Public Language]].
