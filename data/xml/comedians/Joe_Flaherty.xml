'''Joe Flaherty''' (born June 21, 1941) is an American actor, comedian and voice artist. He is best known for his work on the Canadian [[sketch comedy]] ''[[Second City Television|SCTV]]'' from 1976 to 1984 (on which he also served as a writer), and as Harold Weir on ''[[Freaks and Geeks]]''.

==Biography==
Joseph O'Flaherty&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmreference.com/film/51/Joe-Flaherty.html Joe Flaherty Biography (1941-)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; was born in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]], but moved to [[Chicago]], where he started his comedy career with the [[The Second City|Second City]] Theater as Joe O'Flaherty. Along with several other Second City performers, he began appearing on the ''[[National Lampoon Radio Hour]]'' from 1973 to 1974. After seven years in Chicago, he moved to [[Toronto]] to help establish the Toronto Second City theatre troupe. During those years, he was one of the original writer/performers on ''SCTV'', where he spent eight years on the show, playing such characters as Big Jim McBob (of ''Farm Film Report'' fame), [[Count Floyd]]/[[Floyd Robertson]],&lt;ref&gt;A bit of SCTV trivia here: Count Floyd, who was SCTV news anchorman Floyd Robertson in a vampire costume and make-up, is based on Bill Cardille, whom Joe Flaherty watched as a kid growing up in Pittsburgh. Cardille did the weather for the local NBC station, and on weekends hosted the studio wrestling matches and as "Chilly Billy" hosted the Saturday night horror feature.&lt;/ref&gt; and station owner/manager [[Guy Caballero]] who goes around in a [[wheelchair]] only for respect.

Other memorable Flaherty characterizations included emotional talk show host Sammy Maudlin, seedy saxophonist-private eye Vic Arpeggio, aggressive elocution lecturer Norman Gorman, myopic public television host Hugh Betcha, and "crazy as a snake" ex-convict Rocco.

''SCTV'' ceased production in 1984.

Flaherty has appeared in a number of cult favorites, for example, playing the part of the [[Western Union]] postal worker who delivers [[Emmett Brown|Doc Brown's]] 70-year-old letter to [[Marty McFly]] in ''[[Back to the Future Part II]]'' (1989), as well as the crazed fan yelling "jackass!" in ''[[Happy Gilmore]]''. In [[Family Guy (season 8)|season eight]] of ''[[Family Guy]]'', Joe once again played the Western Union man in "[[Something, Something, Something, Dark Side]]". He likewise satirizes his ''Back to the Future Part II'' character in "[[The Big Bang Theory (Family Guy)|The Big Bang Theory]]", this time playing a Vatican worker whose role is essentially identical to that of his Western Union character.

In 1989, Flaherty played a guest role in ''[[Married... with Children]]'' in season-four episode "Tooth or Consequences", as a recently divorced dentist who must repair Al Bundy's teeth.

During 1997–1998, Flaherty starred in the television adaptation of ''Police Academy'' (''[[Police Academy: The Series]]'') as Cmdt. Stuart Hefilfinger. The series lasted for only one season.

In 1999, Flaherty joined the cast of ''[[Freaks and Geeks]]'', an [[NBC]] hour-long [[dramedy]] set in the 1980–1981 academic year, in which he played Harold Weir, the irascible father of two teens. Despite a dedicated cult following, the show only lasted one season. In the third episode, "Tricks and Treats", he dons a cheap vampire costume reminiscent of his "Count Floyd" character of the depicted era.

He made appearances on the [[CBS]] sitcom ''[[The King of Queens]]'' as Father McAndrew, priest at the Heffernans' church. He currently stars on the [[Bite TV]] original program called ''Uncle Joe's Cartoon Playhouse'', and serves as a judge on the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] program ''Second City's: Next Comedy Legend''.

{{As of|2004}}, Flaherty is a member of the faculty at [[Humber College]], where he teaches a comedy-writing course. He is also on the program's advisory committee. He is an accomplished pianist.

Flaherty's brothers are comedy writers David and Paul Flaherty (the latter being a writer on ''SCTV'').

He currently resides in Los Angeles, California. He has a daughter and a son: Gudrun Flaherty and Gabriel Flaherty.
