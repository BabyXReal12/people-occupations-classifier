In Miller's film debut, ''[[Cloverfield]]'', he appeared onscreen for only a few minutes, but his voice was heard in almost every scene as the character who videotaped most of the events depicted.

Unlike his character on the cartoon show, he is "dumb-but-not-in-a-funny-way", according to the ''Buffalo News''.&lt;ref name=BuffaloNews-YogiBearReview-2010&gt;{{cite news|last1=Miller|first1=Melinda|title=Spoiling the fun; Film with potential winds up being mostly unbearable|url=http://buffalonews.com/2010/12/16/spoiling-the-fun-film-with-potential-winds-up-being-mostly-unbearable/|work=[[The Buffalo News]]|date=December 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was cast in the part after two auditions; as a joke, he sent Warner Bros. an improvised video audition with an actual bear, though he had already been offered the part before they received it.&lt;ref name=JordanVogtRoberts-YogiBearAudition-2009&gt;{{cite web|title=T.J.

==Personal life==
In 2014, Miller became engaged to his longtime girlfriend, actress and mixed-media artist Kate, who changed her surname to Miller.&lt;ref name=Vulture-SiliconValleyExit-2017/&gt; They were married at the [[Denver Botanic Gardens]] on September 6, 2015.&lt;ref name=TownAndCountry-Wedding-2016&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sykes|first1=Logan|title=You've Never Seen Anything Like This Whimsical Art Deco-Inspired Wedding|url=http://www.townandcountrymag.com/the-scene/weddings/news/g1346/tj-miller-wedding|work=[[Town &amp; Country (magazine)|Town &amp; Country]]|date=December 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=VanityFair-KateMiller-2017&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harwood|first1=Erika|title=Kate Miller, Artist and Wife of T.J., Is O.K.

Miller described learning about an undiagnosed [[cerebral arteriovenous malformation]] on his right frontal lobe on the [[Pete Holmes]] podcast ''[[You Made It Weird with Pete Holmes|You Made It Weird]]'' on October 28, 2011. He stated that he became more philosophical, narrated his behaviors, and was unable to sleep while filming ''[[Yogi Bear (film)|Yogi Bear]]'' in [[New Zealand]] in 2010. His brain surgery was successful, though there was a 10 percent risk of fatality.&lt;ref name=KCStar-OddballFest-2015 /&gt;&lt;ref name=YouMadeItWeird-Episode2-2011&gt;{{cite news|last1=Holmes|first1=Pete|last2=Miller|first2=T.J.|title=You Made It Weird #2: TJ Miller|url=http://nerdist.com/you-made-it-weird-2-tj-miller/|work=Nerdist|date=28 October 2011|language=en|format=Podcast}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal issues and controversies ==

=== Uber assault incident ===
On December 9, 2016, Miller was arrested and jailed in [[Los Angeles]] for allegedly assaulting a driver of the [[Uber]] car service company because of a debate he had with the driver over [[Donald Trump]], of whom Miller is an outspoken critic. He was released on his own recognizance after bail was set at $20,000.&lt;ref name="People-UberArrest-2016"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://people.com/celebrity/silicon-valley-tj-miller-arrested-on-suspicion-of-battery-on-car-service-driver/|title=Silicon Valley’s T.J.

===Sexual assault allegations===
In late 2017, allegations against Miller from his college days back in 2001 resurfaced, part of a [[Me Too movement|movement of people]] coming forward with [[Weinstein effect|sexual abuse claims about Harvey Weinstein and other Hollywood insiders]]. An anonymous woman who attended [[George Washington University]] with Miller and his wife Kate told ''[[The Daily Beast]]'' reporter Asawin Suebsaeng that Miller (her then boyfriend)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pagesix.com/2017/12/19/t-j-miller-accused-of-sexual-assault-domestic-violence|title=T.J. Miller and wife deny sexual assault allegations against him|date=19 December 2017|publisher=|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; became violent with her during a sexual encounter; he allegedly choked, shook, and punched her in the mouth, all [[Non-consensual sex|without her consent]]. Suebsaeng attempted to contact witnesses and other people involved with the case, some of whom corroborated the accuser's story, adding that it was brought to the attention of the college at the time. Student conduct proceedings were held, the results of which are sealed, although it has been claimed{{by whom|date=August 2018}} that, despite Miller having graduated by that time, he was [[Expulsion (education)|expelled]] as a form of appeasement to the accuser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Suebsaeng|first=Asawin|title='Silicon Valley' Star T.J. Miller Accused of Sexually Assaulting and Punching a Woman|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/silicon-valley-star-tj-miller-accused-of-sexually-assaulting-and-punching-a-woman|publisher=[[The Daily Beast]]|date=December 19, 2017|accessdate=January 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Millers responded to the allegations, characterizing the accuser as a vindictive former colleague in a campus comedy troupe who was asked to leave due to inappropriate behavior. The statement said that "[s]adly she is now using the current climate to bandwagon and launch these false accusations again", and also stated that her accusation "undermines the important movement to make women feel safe coming forward about legitimate claims against real known predators".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Birnbaum|first=Debra|title=T.J.

===Amtrak bomb threat incident===
Miller was arrested on the night of April 9, 2018 at [[LaGuardia Airport]] in [[Queens]], [[New York (state)|New York]] on federal charges related to a [[Bomb threat|fake bomb threat]] made while aboard an [[Amtrak]] train. According to a [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] press release, he placed an [[Emergency telephone number|emergency call]] on March 18, 2018, and reported that a female passenger had "a bomb in her bag" while traveling on [[List of Amtrak routes|Amtrak Train 2256]] from [[Washington, D.C.]], toward [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|Penn Station]] in [[New York City]]. After authorities evacuated passengers and searched Amtrak Train 2256, it turned out that Miller was actually on [[List of Amtrak routes|Amtrak Train 2258]], which was also evacuated of passengers and searched.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/10/entertainment/tj-miller-arrest/index.html T.J. Miller arrested for alleged fake bomb threat], accessed April 10, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; No evidence of any [[explosive device]] or materials was detected after officials stopped and inspected both trains. According to [[witness]]es interviewed by [[Amtrak Police|Amtrak investigators]], he appeared to be heavily [[Alcohol intoxication|intoxicated]] and involved "in hostile exchanges with a woman who was sitting in a different row from him in the first-class car", and that he had been removed from the train prior to his intended stop due to his intoxication. On April 10, 2018 he was released on a $100,000 bond following an appearance at a [[United States District Court for the District of Connecticut|federal court]] hearing in [[New Haven, Connecticut]]. If convicted, he could face up to five years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/10/entertainment/tj-miller-arrest/index.html|title=T.J.

===Work misconduct accusations===
On July 18, 2018, actress [[Alice Wetterlund]], who recurred on ''[[Silicon Valley (TV series)|Silicon Valley]]'', a show in which Miller starred, took to [[Twitter]] to accuse Miller of inappropriate, unprofessional behavior on set, writing: 

{{Quote|“I hope to not ruin it for you, but TJ Miller was a bully and petulant brat.”&lt;ref name="WetterlundAccusation"/&gt;}}

In response to her post, [[HBO]], the premium network that produces the series, released a statement declaring that “While this is the first time we have heard Alice Wetterlund comment on her experiences on ‘Silicon Valley,’ we are disappointed to learn of her concerns. HBO and the producers have always taken very seriously our responsibility to create a welcoming and congenial environment for everyone who works on the show.”&lt;ref name="WetterlundAccusation"&gt;https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/silicon-valley-t-j-miler-1202877293/&lt;/ref&gt;
