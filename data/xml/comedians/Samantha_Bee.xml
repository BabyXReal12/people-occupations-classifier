'''Samantha Jamie Bee''' (born October 25, 1969)&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TCE" /&gt; is a Canadian-American comedian, writer, producer, political commentator, actress, and television host. Bee rose to fame as a correspondent on ''[[The Daily Show|The Daily Show with Jon Stewart]]'', where she became the longest-serving regular correspondent.&lt;ref name="alumni" /&gt; In 2015, she departed the show after 12 years to start her own show, ''[[Full Frontal with Samantha Bee]]''.

Bee became a US citizen in 2014, while retaining her Canadian citizenship. In 2017, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' named her one of the 100 most influential people in the world on their annual [[Time 100|''Time'' 100]] list.

==Early life and education==
Bee was born in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], the daughter of Debra and Ronald Bee.&lt;ref name="book" /&gt; She has said of her family: "Dating from well before the turn of the 20th century, if there has ever been a successful, happy marriage in my family lineage, I've yet to hear about it."&lt;ref name="Fresh Air"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=127217785|title=The Not-So-Secret Life Of Samantha Bee|date=June 2, 2010|publisher=[[NPR]]|work=Fresh Air|accessdate=November 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bee's parents split up soon after her birth, and she was initially raised by her grandmother, who worked as a secretary at the Catholic school Bee attended,&lt;ref name="Crashed"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/features/how-samantha-bee-crashed-the-late-night-boys-club-20160630|title=How Samantha Bee Crashed the Late-Night Boys' Club|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=June 30, 2016|accessdate=July 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; on [[Roncesvalles Avenue]] during her childhood. She attended [[Humberside Collegiate Institute]] and [[York Memorial Collegiate Institute]].&lt;ref name=TorontoStar&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/stage/2009/10/10/samantha_bee_a_beeautiful_life.html|title=Samantha Bee: A Bee-autiful Life|last=Ouzounian|first=Richard|work=[[Toronto Star]]|date=October 10, 2009|accessdate=March 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating from high school, Bee attended [[McGill University]], where she studied humanities. Dissatisfied with a range of issues at the school, she transferred to the [[University of Ottawa]] after her first year. At the University of Ottawa, Bee signed up for a theatre class thinking it would be easy. The class led to Bee discovering her love of performing.&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ic.galegroup.com/ic/bic1/BiographiesDetailsPage/BiographiesDetailsWindow?failOverType=&amp;query=&amp;prodId=BIC1&amp;windowstate=normal&amp;contentModules=&amp;display-query=&amp;mode=view&amp;displayGroupName=Biographies&amp;limiter=&amp;currPage=&amp;disableHighlighting=false&amp;displayGroups=&amp;sortBy=&amp;search_within_results=&amp;p=BIC1&amp;action=e&amp;catId=&amp;activityType=&amp;scanId=&amp;documentId=GALE%7CK1650004669&amp;source=Bookmark&amp;u=mlin_b_northest&amp;jsid=3de1204273193c50638555a32fe31d7b|title=Samantha Bee|publisher=Biography in Context {{subscription required}}|accessdate=February 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Crashed" /&gt; Bee later enrolled in the [[George Brown Theatre School]] in Toronto.&lt;ref name="TorontoStar" /&gt;

==Career==

===Career beginnings===
Bee started auditioning for acting roles in Toronto while working as a waitress.&lt;ref name="Crashed" /&gt; At age 26, Bee toured with a stage production of ''[[Sailor Moon]]'' where she played the titular role.&lt;ref name="Crashed" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Daily Show's Bee helps keep Canada in the "news": However, correspondent does not hide her past as Sailor Moon at the CNE|last=Wyatt|first=Nelson|date=July 22, 2005|work=[[Edmonton Journal]]|agency=[[The Canadian Press]]}} (754 words)&lt;/ref&gt; Bee performed in Sailor Moon's "A" cast and future husband [[Jason Jones (actor)|Jason Jones]] was a member of the "B" cast.&lt;ref name="Crashed" /&gt;

===2003–2014: ''The Daily Show''===

[[File:SamanthaBeeFeb2011.jpg|upright|thumb|Bee at a [[Hudson Union Society]] event, 2011]]
In December 2005, on ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]'', [[Bill O'Reilly (commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] used a clip of Bee from ''The Daily Show'' as an example of "[[Secularization of Christmas#2004-2005 Fox News campaign|The War on Christmas]]", presenting it as having aired recently. The satirical clip featured Bee mentioning how [[Christmas]] was the only religious holiday that's also a [[Federal holidays in the United States|federal holiday in the United States]], with O'Reilly talking about "[[Secularity|Secular]] Central...excuse me, Comedy Central".&lt;ref&gt;''The O'Reilly Factor'', Fox News Channel, December 2, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Radio Factor with Bill O'Reilly'', December 2, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jon Stewart]] responded on his show; inviting Bee out for a discussion, and unlike in the clip that aired on ''Factor'', Bee was visibly eight months pregnant. Bee joked it was obvious that the footage O'Reilly showed was a year old (it originally aired in 2004) because she had different highlights in her hair, before stating that her water had just broken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/wed-december-7-2005/headlines---secular-central|title= Secular Central|date=December 7, 2005|work=The Daily Show with Jon Stewart|publisher=[[Comedy Central]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101110144957/http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/wed-december-7-2005/headlines---secular-central|archivedate=November 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rise and Rise" /&gt; Bee was recognized with a 2005 [[Canadian Comedy Award]] for Best Female TV Performance for her work on ''The Daily Show''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our 2005 Canadian Comedy Award recipients|url=http://www.canadiancomedy.ca/awardwinners.php?year=2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160211223434/http://www.canadiancomedy.ca/awardwinners.php?year=2005|dead-url=yes|archive-date=February 11, 2016|website=Canadian Comedy Awards|accessdate=February 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 20, 2008, Bee finished as the highest scoring celebrity in the [[CBC Television|CBC]] game show ''[[Test The Nation]]''.
