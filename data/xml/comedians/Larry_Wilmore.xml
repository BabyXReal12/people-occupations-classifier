==Early life==
Wilmore was born on October 30, 1961, in [[Los Angeles County, California]],&lt;ref name=birthname-birthdate /&gt; to parents Betty and Larry,&lt;ref name=BOOK-acknowledgments&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wWSZAAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Elister+larry+wilmore&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiKkfbs48POAhVBmx4KHav1CMcQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Elister%20larry%20wilmore&amp;f=false|title=I'd Rather We Got Casinos: And Other Black Thoughts|publisher=Hachette Books|year= 2015|isbn=978-0316262811|page=Acknowledgments}}&lt;/ref&gt; and grew up in suburban [[Pomona, California|Pomona]].&lt;ref name="lee" /&gt; His family is from [[Evanston, Illinois]].&lt;ref name="Humanities"&gt;Wilmore, Larry [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS0W--U9L6c&amp;list=WL "Larry Wilmore: The Wilmore Report."][[Chicago Humanities Festival]], November 19, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Wilmore was raised [[Catholic]].&lt;ref name="lee"&gt;Lee, Felicia R.

As a child, Wilmore found interest in topics such as science, magic, science-fiction and fantasy, all of which have shaped the evolution of his comedy. In an interview with NPR, he described himself as a nerd, saying that "it used to be that the black comic figure had to have this bravado and always showed strength...now there's a comic figure where it's OK to just be a nerd and be black."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=With 100th Episode, Larry Wilmore's 'Nightly Show' Has Found Its Voice | url=https://www.npr.org/2015/08/19/432906983/with-its-100th-episode-larry-wilmores-nightly-show-has-found-its-voice | date=August 19, 2015 | publisher=''npr.org'' | accessdate=May 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Beginning in the 1980s, Wilmore appeared in several small film and television roles, including a recurring role as a police officer on ''[[The Facts of Life (TV series)|The Facts of Life]]''. In the early to mid-1990s, he was on the writing staff of the talk show ''[[Into the Night With Rick Dees]]'',&lt;ref name= king/&gt; the [[sketch comedy]] show ''[[In Living Color]]''&lt;ref name= king/&gt; (his younger brother Marc was also a writer with ''In Living Color'', but, unlike Larry, was also a cast member), and the sitcom ''[[Sister, Sister (TV series)|Sister, Sister]]'', where he portrayed a bus driver in one episode. Wilmore went on to be a writer and producer on a series of sitcoms, including ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]'' and ''[[The Jamie Foxx Show]]''.&lt;ref name= king/&gt;

In 1999, Wilmore co-created the animated comedy ''[[The PJs]]''&lt;ref name=npr&gt;{{cite news |title= 'Black Thoughts' With Comedian Larry Wilmore |work= NPR |date= February 24, 2009 |url= https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=101097742}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Eddie Murphy]] and was executive producer until its conclusion in 2001.

In 2006, Wilmore began appearing regularly on [[Comedy Central]]'s ''[[The Daily Show]]'', where he was billed as the "Senior Black Correspondent" or a derivative form of the title, such as the "Senior Executive Commander-in-Chief Who Happens To Be Black Correspondent" following the election of [[Barack Obama]].&lt;ref name="lee"/&gt; His work on the show frequently centered on humorous observations of the Black experience in American society.&lt;ref name="lee"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bashir"/&gt; In January 2009, [[Disney Hyperion|Hyperion]] published Wilmore's ''I'd Rather We Got Casinos: And Other Black Thoughts'', a political humor book described by [[Booklist]] as "a faux collection of articles, essays, radio transcripts, and letters exploring the more ludicrous angles on race." Wilmore originated the titular phrase ''I'd Rather We Got Casinos'' in a January 2007 ''Daily Show'' appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|title=Black History Month|date=January 31, 2007|publisher=The Daily Show|medium=video clip from episode of television show |quote= Jon Stewart: Don't you feel that black history month serves a purpose?

I'd rather we got casinos. |url= http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/wed-january-31-2007/black-history-month }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilmore has continued to make occasional acting appearances, including a role as a minister in ''[[I Love You, Man]]'' ([[2009 in film|2009]]) and a supporting role in ''[[Dinner for Schmucks]]'' ([[2010 in film|2010]]).
In 2011, Wilmore began a recurring role on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] comedy ''[[Happy Endings (TV series)|Happy Endings]]'', where he played Mr. Forristal, Brad ([[Damon Wayans, Jr.]])'s uptight boss. Since 2012, Wilmore has starred in the [[Showtime (TV channel)|Showtime]] special titled ''Race, Religion and Sex'', shot in [[Salt Lake City]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

On April 30, 2016, Wilmore was the headliner at the [[White House Correspondents' Association]] Dinner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/4132476/larry-wilmore-nightly-show-white-house-correspondents-dinner/|title=Larry Wilmore to Host White House Correspondents' Dinner|last=Rhodan|first=Maya|website=TIME.com|access-date=2016-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; He came under fire for using the word "[[nigga]]" to refer to President Obama, saying "Barry, you did it my nigga."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/05/05/larry-wilmores-n-word-joke-was-an-insult-to-black-journalists/|title=Larry Wilmore’s n-word ‘joke’ was an insult to black journalists|last=Ryan|first=April|date=5 May 2016|website=Washington Post|access-date=2016-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.freep.com/story/news/columnists/rochelle-riley/2016/05/07/larry-wilmore-barack-obama/84027478/|title=What Larry Wilmore did to the president|last=Riley|first=Rochelle|date=7 May 2016|website=Detroit Free Press|access-date=2016-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilmore defended his actions by telling [[Al Sharpton]] "I wanted to make a statement more than a joke...I really wanted to explain the historical implications of the Obama presidency from my point of view."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/larry-wilmore-n-word-no-joke-n570136|title=Larry Wilmore: N-Word Was No Joke|last=Coleburn|first=Christina|date=8 May 2016|website=NBC News|access-date=2016-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2017, Wilmore started hosting a podcast as part of [[The Ringer (website)|The Ringer]] podcast network, headed by [[Bill Simmons]].

===''The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore''===
{{main article|The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore}}
On January 19, 2015 Wilmore began hosting ''The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore'', a [[Late night television|late-night]] [[Panel discussion|panel]] [[Late-night talk show|talk show]] that aired on Comedy Central. It was a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of ''The Daily Show'', and served as a replacement for ''[[The Colbert Report]]''. It was produced by Jon Stewart's production company [[Busboy Productions]]. The show was criticized for a controversial segment featuring [[Bill Nye]] in September 2015, with'' [[Adweek]]'' characterizing it as the moment that Wilmore had "turned away from Colbert's legacy of intellectualism." The Nye segment may have negatively affected viewership, with ratings down more than half from the year before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Griner |first=David |url=http://www.adweek.com/news/television/was-moment-larry-wilmore-lost-stephen-colberts-intellectual-appeal-169712 |title=Larry Wilmore's Ratings Are 55% Lower Than The Colbert Report, and This Clip May Prove Why |work=[[Adweek]] |date=2016-02-16 |accessdate=2016-02-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 15, 2016, Comedy Central announced that Wilmore's show had been cancelled. The show ended on August 18, 2016, with a total of 259 episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/16/business/media/comedy-central-cancels-larry-wilmores-late-night-show.html|title=Comedy Central Cancels Larry Wilmore’s Late-Night Show|date=August 16, 2016|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In June 2017, Wilmore came under fire for comments he had made during his time on ''The Nightly Show''. When reporting on the case of [[Otto Warmbier]], an American student arrested in [[North Korea]] and sentenced to 15 years of hard labor for allegedly attempting to steal a propaganda sign, Wilmore repeatedly ridiculed Warmbier.  Wilmore referred to Warmbier as "Otto Von Crybaby" and suggested that Warmbier thought he had "Frat Bro Privilege".  Otto Warmbier died on June 19, 2017, after being medically evacuated from North Korea to the U.S. in a comatose state, after 15 months in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Fondacaro |first=Nicholas |url=http://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/nicholas-fondacaro/2017/06/19/flashback-comedy-central-huffpo-mocked-capture-otto-warmbier |title=FLASHBACK: Comedy Central, HuffPo Mocked Capture of Otto Warmbier |work=[[Media Research Center]] |date=19 June 2017 |accessdate=24 June 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rosenberg |first=Ayssa |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/act-four/wp/2017/06/21/what-we-can-learn-from-the-harshest-responses-to-otto-warmbiers-captivity/ |title=What we can learn from the harshest responses to Otto Warmbier’s captivity |work=[[Washington Post]] |date=21 June 2017 |accessdate=24 June 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Black on the Air'' podcast on June 22, 2017, Wilmore offered an apology for his earlier remarks about Warmbier.&lt;ref name="Wilstein"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Wilstein |first1=Matt |title=Larry Wilmore Apologizes to Otto Warmbier’s Family |url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/larry-wilmore-apologizes-to-otto-warmbiers-family |work=[[The Daily Beast]] |date=June 22, 2017 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wilmore |first1=Larry |title=The Situation in North Korea, Patriotism vs. Criticism, and Kumail Nanjiani on Arranged Marriages and ‘The Big Sick’ (Ep. 6) |url=https://art19.com/shows/larry-wilmore/episodes/dd0cbf1c-5fc1-4858-b65a-c69bbcfbde89 |website=Black on the Air|publisher=ART19 |date=June 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
