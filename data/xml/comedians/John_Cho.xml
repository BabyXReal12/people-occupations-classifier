He is best known as Harold Lee in the ''[[Harold &amp; Kumar]]'' films; John (MILF Guy No. 2), who popularized the term "[[MILF (slang)|MILF]]" in the ''[[American Pie (film)|American Pie]]'' films; and [[Hikaru Sulu]] in the ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'' [[Star Trek (film series)#Rebootfilms|reboot film series]]. Early in his career, Cho also starred in the [[Asian American]] centered films ''[[Better Luck Tomorrow]]'' (2002), ''[[Shopping for Fangs]]'' (1997), and ''[[Yellow (1998 film)|Yellow]]'' (1998). He starred in the 2018 psychological thriller film ''[[Searching (film)|Searching]]'', making him the first Asian-American actor in history to headline a mainstream thriller film in Hollywood.

On television, Cho played [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent [[Characters in FlashForward (television show)#Main characters|Demetri Noh]] in the [[science fiction]] television drama ''[[FlashForward]]''; Chau Presley on the [[sitcom]] ''[[Off Centre]]''; Andy Brooks in the horror drama ''[[Sleepy Hollow (TV series)|Sleepy Hollow]]'', Henry Higgs in the 2014 sitcom ''[[Selfie (TV series)|Selfie]]'', and Andrew Kim in ''[[The Exorcist (TV series)|The Exorcist]]''.

== Early life ==
Cho was born in [[Seoul]], South Korea,&lt;ref name=tvg /&gt; and moved to the United States in 1978 as a young boy. He was raised in [[Los Angeles]], where his family settled after living in [[Houston]], [[Seattle]], [[Daly City, California]], and [[Monterey Park, California]].&lt;ref name=Kevin/&gt;&lt;ref name=UCLA&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.asiaarts.ucla.edu/090703/article.asp?parentID=110087 | publisher=Asia Pacific Arts ([[UCLA Asia Institute]])| title= The Game-Changer: An Interview with John Cho | date= July 3, 2009| first= Oliver| last= Wang| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140121080301/http://www.asiaarts.ucla.edu/090703/article.asp?parentID=110087 | archivedate=January 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was a minister in the [[Churches of Christ|Church of Christ]], and was originally from North Korea.&lt;ref name=Kevin&gt;''Kevin Pollak's Chat Show,'' Hulu.com and Ustream, episode 96&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UCLA/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = What to watch|url = http://www.aoltv.com/2011/10/27/john-cho-kal-penn-different-white-house-experiences-video/|website = AOL.com|accessdate = 2015-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cho graduated from [[Herbert Hoover High School (Glendale)|Herbert Hoover High School]],&lt;ref name=UCLA/&gt; in [[Glendale, California]], in 1990. He then attended the [[University of California, Berkeley]],&lt;ref name=UCLA/&gt; graduating in 1996 with a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] degree in English,&lt;ref name=ans&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/john-cho|title=John Cho}}&lt;/ref&gt; and taught English at [[Pacific Hills School]] in [[West Hollywood, California]] while working at [[East West Players]]'s theater in downtown [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name=Kevin/&gt;

== Career ==
Cho began his career after graduating from Berkeley, when he moved to Los Angeles and worked with the [[Asian American theatre]] company [[East West Players]].&lt;ref name=UCLA/&gt; There, he appeared in Edward Sakamoto's ''The Taste of Kona Coffee'' in 1996, and in  Euijoon Kim's movie ''My Tired Broke Ass Pontificating Slapstick Funk'' in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eastwestplayers.org/about_us/production_history/mybrokeass.htm EWP 34th Season] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110406114333/http://www.eastwestplayers.org/about_us/production_history/mybrokeass.htm |date=2011-04-06 }} on [[East West Players]] site&lt;/ref&gt; He gained attention with a small role as "MILF Guy #2" in the 1999 comedy ''[[American Pie (film)|American Pie]]'', in which he popularized the slang term "[[MILF (slang)|MILF]]".&lt;ref name=UCLA/&gt;  Cho reprised the role in three sequels: ''[[American Pie 2]]'', ''[[American Wedding]]'', and in the latest installment ''[[American Reunion]]'' in which he has a much larger role. The character initially had no name but he was given the name "John" in the third film, named after Cho himself.

Cho guest-starred on ''[[Dead Man Dating|Charmed]]'' as a [[ghost]] in 1998 and was one of the stars of the short-lived situation comedy ''[[Off Centre]]'' in 2001&amp;ndash;2002. He was a costar of the now-defunct [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] sitcom ''[[Kitchen Confidential (TV series)|Kitchen Confidential]]'' based on [[Anthony Bourdain]]'s [[Kitchen Confidential: Adventures in the Culinary Underbelly|best-selling book]].&lt;ref name=ans/&gt; He had supporting roles in ''[[Evolution (2001 film)|Evolution]]'', a [[science fiction|sci-fi]] comedy directed by [[Ivan Reitman]], ''[[Down to Earth (2001 film)|Down to Earth]]'', starring [[Chris Rock]], and ''[[Bowfinger]]'', with [[Steve Martin]].

In 2002, he had a starring role in the ensemble cast of [[Justin Lin]]'s ''[[Better Luck Tomorrow]]'', a drama focusing on the travails of a group of [[Asian American]]s living in Southern California who are academically successful but socially discontented, and as a result engage in wantonly violent, criminal behavior. It was well received by critics, with the ''New York Times's'' Elvis Mitchell describing Cho's character's "lazy magnetism of which he is charmingly aware."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/11/movies/film-review-teenagers-determined-to-damage-their-resumes.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|title=Film Review; Teenages Determined to Damage Their Resumes|first=Elvis|last=Mitchell|accessdate=26 August 2012|work=The New York Times|date=2003-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later that year, the movie Big Fat Liar was released, in which Cho played a Hong Kong-based movie director.  He refused to do the accent scripted for his character.  The director worked with him to re-develop the role.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, Gail (October 9, 2014), [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/10/09/john-cho-of-selfie-wants-roles-outside-any-asian-stereotype-2/ "John Cho of ‘Selfie': ‘I experienced racism’"]. The Washington Post. Retrieved June 16, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

He had a successful starring role as Harold Lee in 2004's [[Harold &amp; Kumar Go to White Castle]] and reprised the role in 2008's ''[[Harold &amp; Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay]],'' which raked in $38 million at the theaters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=haroldandkumar2.htm|title=Harold &amp; Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay|publisher=boxofficemojo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and again in 2011's ''[[A Very Harold &amp; Kumar 3D Christmas]]'' which made $35 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=haroldandkumar3.htm|title=A Very Harold &amp; Kumar 3D Christmas|publisher=boxofficemojo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cho's role in the popular franchise was written specifically for him by [[Hayden Schlossberg]], and Cho has recounted that when Schlossberg first approached him with the role, he was initially suspicious.&lt;ref name=Kevin/&gt;

Cho appeared on July 2004 issue of ''[[KoreAm Journal]]'' and in September 2006 was cast in NBC's new comedy ''[[The Singles Table]]'', but the series never aired due to changes in scheduling and production. In 2006 and again in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.people.com/people/package/gallery/0,,20315920_20320457,00.html#20705500 People Magazine Sexiest Men Alive 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; Cho was selected as one of the sexiest men alive in ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' magazine.

In 2007, Cho was added to the cast of ''[[Ugly Betty]]'' as a recurring character. Cho plays Kenny, a best friend of accountant [[Henry Grubstick]] (played by [[Christopher Gorham]]). Cho played helmsman [[Hikaru Sulu]] in [[J. J. Abrams]]'s feature film ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3if4ef26bbb490c2c53a944c8e92a50006 |date=2007-10-12|title=Final frontier for Cho, Pegg|author=Borys Kit}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/SHOWBIZ/Movies/03/12/john.cho.ap/index.html|title=John Cho: 'Trek' role is 'daunting'|agency=Associated Press|publisher=CNN|date=2008-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manohla Dargis of ''The New York Times'' praised him, along with [[Anton Yelchin]], [[Chris Pine]], and [[Zachary Quinto]], for making their roles "ultimately and rather wonderfully their own".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2009/05/08/movies/08trek.html |title=Movie Review: 'Star Trek' |author=[[Manohla Dargis]] |date=7 May 2009|accessdate=27 Aug 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cho appeared in [[Nas]]' "[[Be a Nigger Too]]" music video along with various celebrities, and had a guest appearance on the sitcom ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]'', in the episode "[[I'm Not That Guy]]" where he played a partner in an evil law firm. Of the latter, Staci Krause of [[IGN]], wrote that Cho was "the scene stealer in this episode" and that she would "definitely like to see more of him" in the series.&lt;ref name=IGN&gt;{{cite web |publisher=IGN |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/10/30/how-i-met-your-mother-im-not-that-guy-review |title= How I Met Your Mother: 'I'm Not That Guy' Review |date=2007-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2009 to 2010, Cho starred in the television series ''[[FlashForward]]'' as FBI Special Agent [[Demetri Noh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Fall-TV-ABC-1006175.aspx|title=Fall TV: ABC's Official Schedule Revisits V, Moves Betty and Says Adieu to Who?|author=[[Joyce Eng]]|work=[[TV Guide]]|date=2009-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; His character was originally slated to be killed off during what turned out to be the show's only season, but after his turn as Sulu in ''Star Trek'' boosted his popularity, the producers revised the show's storyline so that he survived, in an attempt to boost declining ratings.&lt;ref name="FlashForward Keck"&gt;{{cite web|last=Keck|first=William|authorlink=William Keck|title=Keck's Exclusives: Gabrielle Union FlashForwards to New Series|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Kecks-Exclusives-Gabrielle-1019728.aspx|work=TV Guide|date=June 18, 2010|accessdate=July 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He starred as Henry Higgs in the short-lived sitcom ''[[Selfie (TV series)|Selfie]]'', a retooling of the play ''[[Pygmalion (play)|Pygmalion]]'' by [[George Bernard Shaw]],&lt;ref&gt;Doll, Jen (October 20, 2014), [https://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-10-16/review-abcs-selfie-fails-to-get-the-internet-right "YOU CAN’T DO THAT ON TELEVISION]." ''Business Week''.

In 2018 he starred in the film ''[[Searching (film)|Searching]]'', which was the first mainstream thriller headlined by an Asian-American actor in Hollywood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=General |first=Ryan |url=https://nextshark.com/john-cho-searching-thriller-asian-actor/ |title=John Cho Makes History as the First Asian Actor Leading a Hollywood Thriller in 'Searching' |publisher=Nextshark.com |date=2018-07-25 |accessdate=2018-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musical career==
Cho is the lead singer for Viva La Union (formerly known as Left of Zed),&lt;ref name=ans/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/person/224268/John-Cho/biography|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2005-03-12|title=John Cho|author=Jason Buchanan}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Los Angeles [[garage rock]] band composed of former [[University of California at Berkeley|Berkeley]] and [[University of Southern California|USC]] students. They have one album, self-titled, while their song "Chinese Baby" is featured on the [[Harold &amp; Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay#Soundtrack|''Harold &amp; Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay'' soundtrack]].

== Being an Asian American in Hollywood ==
Cho has indicated he has found freedom in being Harold in the ''Harold and Kumar'' films because the stoner character goes against the grain of Asian Americans onscreen.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94HUM3S_Gzg|title = John Cho On Playing The Asian-American Stoner Stereotype |work= Larry King Now|date = |accessdate =  |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has said he has experienced racism throughout his career in Hollywood and that he tries to take roles that do not perpetuate Asian stereotypes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title = In 'Selfie', John Cho Gets An Unlikely Shot As A Romantic Lead|url = https://www.npr.org/blogs/codeswitch/2014/09/28/352046466/selfie-s-choice-john-cho-gets-an-unlikely-shot-as-a-romantic-lead|publisher = [[National Public Radio]] |accessdate = 2015-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked to do an Asian accent for ''Big Fat Liar'', Cho refused. "I don't want to do this role in a kid's comedy, with an accent, because I don't want young people laughing at an accent inadvertently", he wrote.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = John Cho of 'Selfie': 'I experienced racism'|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/10/09/john-cho-of-selfie-wants-roles-outside-any-asian-stereotype-2/|newspaper = The Washington Post|date = 2014-10-09|access-date = 2015-11-30|issn = 0190-8286|language = en-US|first = Gail|last = Sullivan}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2015 tweet he said, "[[Whitewashing in film|Stop turning Asian roles white]].

"Asians narratively in shows are insignificant. They're the cop, or waitress, or whatever it is. You see them in the background. So to be in this position ... is bit of a landmark," he has said on the inability of Asians getting offered such roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Will John Cho Be Television's First Asian Romantic Lead?|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/victoria-namkung/tvs-first-asian-romantic-lead_b_5878380.html|website = The Huffington Post|accessdate = 2015-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|title = "Asians narratively in shows are insignificant," says John Cho, the romantic lead in the fall series Selfie.
