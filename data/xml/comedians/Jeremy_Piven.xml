Piven's first important role came in 1992 when he became a regular cast member on HBO's ''[[The Larry Sanders Show]],'' in which he played the head writer Jerry.

Piven was a supporting cast member on the last three seasons of the sitcom ''[[Ellen (TV series)|Ellen]]'', wherein he played the part of Ellen's cousin, Spence.

The two were co-stars in ''[[Smokin' Aces]]'' and appeared together when Piven hosted ''SNL'' in January 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://snlarc.jt.org/ep.php?i=200701208 SNL Archives | Episode] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011201413/http://snlarc.jt.org/ep.php?i=200701208 |date=2007-10-11 }}.

The production began preview performances on October 3, 2008 and opened on October 23, 2008; the play was due to run through February 22, 2009. After Piven missed several performances, on December 17, 2008, Piven's representation announced that due to an undisclosed illness, Piven would be ending his run in the play effective immediately.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tmz.com/2008/12/17/docs-to-piven-broadway-is-bad-for-your-health/ Docs Tell Piven: Broadway is Bad for Your Health] TMZ, December 17, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The illness was revealed to be [[Mercury poisoning|hydrargaria]], a disease caused by exposure to [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] or its compounds, though the source is unknown. Rumours have indicated that the high level of mercury could potentially have been caused by Piven's habit of consuming fish twice a day for the past 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|nZpm-OOYG3A|NFI Response to Jeremy's Piven's Claims About Fish and Mercury}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative explanation is that the herbal remedies Piven was taking were responsible for his high levels of mercury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jdc325.wordpress.com/2008/12/19/fishy-poisoning-story/ |title=Discussion of the possible cause of poisoning |publisher=Jdc325.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mamet joked that Piven was leaving the play "to pursue a career as a thermometer."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.playbill.com/news/article/124437.html Jeremy Piven Abruptly Departs Broadway's Speed-the-Plow] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220083042/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/124437.html |date=2008-12-20 }} Playbill, December 17, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; On September 1, 2009, Piven, in a guest appearance on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'', explained that he had given up red meat and poultry, and had been getting all of his protein from fish for the past 20 years.

== Personal life ==
Piven starred in the [[Travel Channel]] special, ''Jeremy Piven's Journey of a Lifetime'', detailing his journey across India.

In 2016, Piven endorsed Senator [[Bernie Sanders]] for [[President of the United States]] during the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://berniesanders.com/artists/|title=Artists For Bernie|publisher=Bernie Sanders.com|accessdate=April 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Piven is a fan of the [[Chicago Bears]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jeremy Piven juggles movie premiere, watching Bears|work=ESPN|url=http://espn.go.com/espn/page2/index?id=7204778 |accessdate=February 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, he appeared in commercials for the [[Chicago Blackhawks]].

==Sexual misconduct allegations== 
On October 30, 2017, actress Ariane Bellamar accused Piven of several instances of sexual harassment and assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://variety.com/2017/biz/news/jeremy-piven-sexual-harassment-entourage-1202603537/ |title=Jeremy Piven ‘Unequivocally’ Denies Groping Allegations |first=Erin |last=Nyren|date=October 31, 2017 |work=Variety |access-date=January 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, Piven responded to these allegations writing, "I unequivocally deny the appalling allegations being peddled about me. It did not happen".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Messer |first1=Lesley |last2=Chervokas |first2=Jason |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/jeremy-piven-unequivocally-denies-appalling-groping-allegations/story?id=50850242 |title=Jeremy Piven 'unequivocally' denies 'appalling' groping allegations |date=November 1, 2017 |publisher=ABC News |accessdate=November 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cassidy Freeman]] came to Bellamar's defense in an [[Instagram]] post, alluding to her own troubling past with Piven, who the actress claims engaged in "predatory behavior" toward her when she was "far too young".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Delbyck |first1=Cole |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/smallville-actress-cassidy-freeman-slams-jeremy-piven-for-predatory-behavior_us_59fb1c73e4b01b474048a2ac |title=‘Smallville’ Actress Cassidy Freeman Calls Out Jeremy Piven’s ‘Predatory Behavior’|date=November 2, 2017 |work=Huffington Post |accessdate=November 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 9, advertising executive Tiffany Bacon Scourby alleged that Piven had attacked her in 2003, stating that he had "jumped on" her, "exposed his genitals, held her hands down and began rubbing against her body until he ejaculated".&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://deadline.com/2017/11/jeremy-piven-sexual-assault-tiffany-bacon-scourby-1202204960/ |title=Jeremy Piven Says Sexual Harassment Allegations Against Him 'Are Absolutely False &amp; Completely Fabricated'|first=Greg|last=Evans|date=November 10, 2017 |website=Deadline |access-date=January 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Piven responded to the allegations, calling them "absolutely false and completely fabricated". A representative for Piven said the actor was "looking at legal options".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/jeremy-piven-instagram-sexual-allegations-response-denial-a8048511.html |title=Jeremy Piven on Hollywood sex scandal: 'Careers are being destroyed based on mere allegations'|date=November 10, 2017|work=The Independent|access-date=January 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; 

On November 13, Piven voluntarily took a [[polygraph test]] in which he was asked a series of questions about each allegation, which allegations he again denied. He passed the test with "no signs of deception". The polygraph test was administered by a member of the American Polygraph Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/jeremy-piven-groping-allegations-lie-detector-test-arianne-bellamar-entourage-a8066891.html |title=Jeremy Piven has taken a lie detector test after sexual misconduct allegations|date=2017-11-21|work=The Independent |access-date=2017-11-22|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2017/11/jeremy-piven-sexual-assault-allegations-anastasia-taneie-entourage-1202214231/#comments |title=‘Entourage’ Extra Alleges Jeremy Piven Sexually Assaulted Her In 2009 – Report |first=Nancy |last=Tartaglione |date=November 23, 2017 |website=Deadline|access-date=January 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that month, Anastasia Taneie, who worked as an extra on ''[[Entourage (U.S. TV series)|Entourage]]'', alleged that Piven "confronted her in a dark hallway and groped her breast and genitals as he forcefully pushed her against a wall".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/fourth-woman-accuses-jeremy-piven-of-sexual-misconduct-2017-11|title=Another woman has accused Jeremy Piven of sexual misconduct on the set of HBO's 'Entourage'|work=Business Insider |access-date=January 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 27, 2017, CBS decided not to order a full season of ''[[Wisdom of the Crowd]]'', following weak ratings and allegations of sexual harassment involving Piven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tvline.com/2017/11/27/wisdom-of-the-crowd-cancelled-cbs-jeremy-piven-sexual-assault-allegations/ |title=Wisdom of the Crowd Cancelled Amid Jeremy Piven Sexual Assault Scandal |last=Schwartz|first=Ryan |work=[[TVLine]]|date=November 27, 2017|accessdate=December 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2018, [[BuzzFeed]] published an article in which three more women accused Piven of "sexual misconduct or inappropriate behavior". They alleged Piven pinned down one woman on a couch after following her to her trailer on the set of a film in 1985, engaged in "physically aggressive" behavior with another while on a date, and attempted to force himself on the third woman in a hotel room around 1994. BuzzFeed News corroborated the stories with eight people who said the women had shared the encounters with them in the years since. Piven "vehemently denied" all the allegations, and his lawyer called them "works of fiction", saying they were opportunistic efforts to "obtain attention and/or money". Piven submitted a written statement to BuzzFeed, in which he referred to the lie detector test he had taken and asserted: "I have never forced myself on anyone, nor have I ever exposed myself or restrained anyone against their will. To the contrary, if any woman ever said no, I stopped".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/krystieyandoli/jeremy-piven-sexual-misconduct-allegations-follow-up|title=Exclusive: Three More Women Are Accusing Jeremy Piven Of Sexual Misconduct |website=Buzzfeed|access-date=January 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://time.com/5122036/jeremy-piven-allegations/ |title=Jeremy Piven Faces Sexual Misconduct Allegations From 3 More Women |work=Time |access-date=January 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
