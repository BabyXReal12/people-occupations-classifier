'''Richard Caruthers Little''' (born November 26, 1938) is a [[Canadian-American]] [[Impressionist (entertainment)|impressionist]] and [[voice actor]]. He has been nicknamed "The Man of a Thousand Voices".

==Early life==
Little was born in [[Ottawa, Ontario]], Canada, the middle of three sons of Lawrence Peniston Little, a doctor, and Elizabeth Maud (née Wilson).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/7/Rich-Little.html |title=Rich Little Biography (1938-) |publisher=Filmreference.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[Lisgar Collegiate Institute]]. In his early teens, he formed a partnership with [[Geoffrey Scott (Canadian politician)|Geoff Scott]], another budding impressionist, concentrating on reproducing the voices of Canadian politicians such as [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[John Diefenbaker]] and Ottawa mayor [[Charlotte Whitton]]. (Geoff went on to become a politician.) He and Scott were performing professionally in night clubs by their late teens.

==Career==
Little was an usher at the Elgin Movie Theatre in Ottawa, where he would perfect his voices while standing at the back of the theatre. He started his amateur acting career at Ottawa's Little Theatre, winning his first acting award at the Eastern Ontario Drama Festival in Deep River, Ontario. He went on to become a successful [[disc jockey]], frequently incorporating impersonations into his show. In 1963, Little issued two LPs in Canada; the first, ''My Fellow Canadians'', concentrated on Canadian political satire and featured Little and two other actors impersonating figures well-known to a Canadian audience. The second album, ''Scrooge and the Stars'', featured Little acting out Charles Dickens' ''A Christmas Carol'' entirely on his own, playing all the roles as 22 different Hollywood stars, ranging from [[Jack Benny]] to [[Jack Webb]].

On the strength of his club work and recordings, Little was asked to audition by [[Mel Tormé]], who was working behind the scenes on a new variety show for [[Judy Garland]]. The audition won him the job, and in 1964 Little made his American television debut on [[CBS]]'s ''[[The Judy Garland Show]]'', where he imitated various male celebrities, including [[James Mason]] in ''[[A Star Is Born (1954 film)|A Star Is Born]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNT8UGydiCQ Rich Little on Judy Garland Show, 1964], 8 min.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, Little provided the voice for the Pink Panther in two experimental cartoons, ''[[Sink Pink]]'' and ''[[Pink Ice]]''.

In 1966 and 1967, Little appeared in [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC-TV]]'s [[Judy Carne]] [[sitcom]] ''[[Love on a Rooftop]]'' as the Willises' eccentric neighbour, Stan Parker. He appeared on ''[[That Girl]]'' in 1967 as a writer who impressed [[Marlo Thomas]]' character with his impersonations. He also made two memorable appearances as accident-prone Brother Paul Leonardi on ''[[The Flying Nun]]'' in 1968; it marked one of his few appearances as a character actor rather than an impressionist.  In 1969 he appeared in an episode of ''[[Petticoat Junction]]'' as newly engaged fiance to Billie Jo in "Billie Jo and the Big Big Star".

Little was a frequent guest on variety and [[talk show]]s. With [[Johnny Carson]] he captured ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' host's voice and many onstage mannerisms (and later played Carson in the [[HBO]] TV-movie ''[[The Late Shift (film)|The Late Shift]]''). Little's spot-on impersonation allegedly got under the thin skin of Carson and he was permanently banned from appearing on the Tonight Show without notice or reason after his August 1982 appearance according to Little's biography, and this claim was supported by Henry Bushkin, Carson's long-time lawyer, who stated that nobody got under Carson's skin more than Little.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldweekly.com/surprising-facts-from-the-johnny-carson-show/26/ Carson can't take it]&lt;/ref&gt; In response, [[Fred DeCordova]], Carson's producer, said they just weren't interested in hiring him any more due to his lack of new impressions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1985-06-13/features/8502070608_1_imitators-tonight-show-freddie Rich Little left out of Tonight]&lt;/ref&gt; 

One of his best-known impressions is of US President [[Richard Nixon]] (reprising in 1991 the role of Nixon as ideal sperm donor in Gina's fantasies on the soap opera ''[[Santa Barbara (TV series)|Santa Barbara]]''.) During the 1970s, Little made many television appearances portraying Nixon. He was a regular guest on ''[[The Dean Martin Celebrity Roast]]s'' in the 1970s, where he roasted celebrities such as [[Don Rickles]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bHsYDH_7I4 Rich Little roasts Don Rickles]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jack Benny]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBHiUnFukGU Rich Little roasts Jack Benny]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johnny Carson]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaEBz2Sk1kA Rich Little roasts Johnny Carson]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frank Sinatra]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PD1poa0xxaY Rich Little roasts Frank Sinatra]&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Stewart|Jimmy Stewart]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5SID6x1jJ8 Rich Little roasts Jimmy Stewart]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kirk Douglas]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej2J4b5rO0Y Rich Little roasts Kirk Douglas]&lt;/ref&gt;

Little was also a semi-regular on the Emmy-winning ABC-TV variety series ''[[The Julie Andrews Hour]]'' in 1972–73. In response to his imitation of [[Jack Benny]], the comedian sent Little an 18-carat gold money clip containing this message: "With [[Bob Hope]] doing my walk and you doing my voice, I can be a star and do nothing." He was named "Comedy Star of the Year" by the [[American Guild of Variety Artists]] in 1974.

Little's best-known continuing TV series was ''The Kopycats'', hour-long segments of ''[[The ABC Comedy Hour]]'', first broadcast in 1972. Taped in [[England]], these comedy-variety shows consisted entirely of celebrity impersonations, with the actors in full costume and makeup for every sketch. The cast included Little, [[Frank Gorshin]], [[Marilyn Michaels]], [[George Kirby]], British comedian Joe Baker, [[Fred Travalena]], [[Charlie Callas]] and [[Peter Goodwright]].

''The Rich Little Show'' (1976) and ''[[You Asked For It|The New You Asked for It]]'' (1981) were attempts to present Little in his own person, away from his gallery of characterizations. Little also appeared on a second season episode of ''[[The Muppet Show]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Garlen|first1=Jennifer C.|last2=Graham|first2=Anissa M.|title=Kermit Culture: Critical Perspectives on Jim Henson's Muppets|year=2009|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company|isbn=078644259X|page=218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981 Little appeared in a comedy LP called ''The First Family Rides Again'', which was the fourth and final 'First Family' comedy LPs originally created by Bob Booker and Earle Doud. Little starred along with Melanie Chartoff, Michael Richards, Shelly Black, Jenilee Harrison, Earle Doud, and Vaughn Meader, making light of US President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s years in the White House.

Little has starred in various [[HBO]] specials including the 1978 one-man show, ''[[Rich Little's Christmas Carol]]'', in which Little portrayed famous comedians in established roles ([[W. C. Fields]] as [[Ebenezer Scrooge]], [[Paul Lynde]] as [[Bob Cratchit]], et al). He has also appeared in several movies and released nine albums.

Outside of any comedic context, Little's talent for impersonation has been used in movies when an actor's dialogue was impaired by poor health. When [[David Niven]] proved too ill for his voice to be used in his appearances in ''[[Trail of the Pink Panther]]'' (1982) and ''[[Curse of the Pink Panther]]'' (1983), Little provided the overdub as an imitation of Niven's voice. He performed similar duties to dub an imitation [[James Cagney]]'s stroke-impaired voice in the 1984 TV movie ''[[Terrible Joe Moran]]'',&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088248/reviews&lt;/ref&gt; and in the 1991 TV special ''Christmas at the Movies'' by providing an uncredited dub for actor/dancer [[Gene Kelly]] who had lost his voice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sandiegodramaking.blogspot.co.il/2012/06/interview-with-rich-little-master.html|title=Laugh a Lot or a "Little": An interview with Rich Little, the man of a thousand voices |date=26 June 2012 |accessdate=17 October 2012 |first=Donna |last=Matsuda |work=San Diego Drama King}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also lent his voice to the narration of three specials which were the forerunners for the animated series ''[[The Raccoons]]'': ''[[The Christmas Raccoons]]'', ''[[The Raccoons on Ice]]'' and ''[[The Raccoons and the Lost Star]].&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|ewGv-DROrU4|''The Christmas Raccoons''}}, {{YouTube|GsDmFklfo0g|''The Raccoons On Ice''}} and {{YouTube|SwRlO9Zz7Ao|''The Raccoons and the Lost Star''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, during "We the People 200: The Constitutional Gala" television special, Little personified various historical figures including [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], [[Edward R. Murrow]], [[John F. Kennedy]], [[Robert Kennedy]] and [[Martin Luther King, Jr]]. Little's performance was described as eclectic, impersonating [[Henry Fonda]] as Abraham Lincoln and doing [[Winston Churchill]] giving a rousing speech.&lt;ref&gt;Levin, Daniel. ''Representing Popular Sovereignty: The Constitution in American Political Culture'', State Univ. of New York Press (1999) p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWi6PUVqSw4 "Rich Little impersonates historical figures, 1987], 6 min.&lt;/ref&gt;

Little was the host for the 2007 [[White House Correspondents' Association]] dinner. Although President [[George W. Bush]] was reported to have enjoyed Little's performance, it was panned by some reviewers for "his ancient jokes and impressions of dead people (Johnny Carson, Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Akers |first=Mary Ann |url= http://blog.washingtonpost.com/sleuth/2007/04/how_they_wound_up_with_rich_li.html |title=Rich Little Bravely Answers Washington's Call |publisher=Blog.washingtonpost.com |date= 23 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Adams |first=Richard |url=http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/news/archives/2007/04/23/every_day_is_a_whining_rove.html |title=Every day is a whining Rove |publisher=Blogs.guardian.co.uk |date= 23 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Harper |first=Tim |url=https://www.thestar.com/News/article/206090 |title=Jokes leave Washington a Little cold |publisher= [[The Toronto Star]] |date= 23 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Little voices as a [[guest star]] in ''[[Futurama]]'' such as ''[[Futurama: Bender's Game]]'', playing his own [[List of recurring characters in Futurama#Celebrity heads|celebrity head]]: "This is Rich Little, impersonating [[Howard Cosell]]." Many times he plays a sports commentator.

As of February, 2018, Little is a regular performer at the [[Laugh Factory]] in the [[Tropicana Las Vegas|Tropicana]] hotel in [[Las Vegas]]. His one-hour show is a career retrospective including video highlights from his TV career. Throughout the show, he displays many of the charcoal sketches he has drawn of the celebrities he has impersonated.

In 1998, Little was inducted into [[Canada's Walk of Fame]].

==Other interests==
Little has been active in several [[Charitable organization|charities]] including the [[Juvenile Diabetes Cure Alliance|Juvenile Diabetes Fund]] and the [[Children's Miracle Network]]. He has been named to [[Miami Children's Hospital]] International Pediatrics Hall of Fame and been honoured by the naming of the Rich Little Special Care Nursery at [[Ottawa Civic Hospital]]. He has been a major supporter in helping veterans through the [[Gary Sinise Foundation]].
