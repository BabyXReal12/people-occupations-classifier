== Early life ==
Henry Franklin Winkler was born on October 30, 1945, on the [[West Side (Manhattan)|West Side]] of [[Manhattan, New York]],&lt;ref name="EmmyTVLegends-Interview-2006"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Herman|first1=Karen|title=Emmy TV Legends: Henry Winkler|url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/henry-winkler|accessdate=20 April 2015|work=[[Archive of American Television]]|publisher=[[Emmys]]|date=10 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FamilySearch-USPR-1996"&gt;{{cite web|title=Henry Franklin Winkler - United States Public Records|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:QJXJ-Y7QK|website=[[FamilySearch]]|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the son of homemaker Ilse Anna Marie (''née'' Hadra; 1913–2002) and lumber import-export&lt;ref name="people.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://people.com/archive/happy-daze-vol-55-no-18/|title=Happy Daze|author=|date=|website=people.com|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; company president Harry Irving Winkler (1903–1995). His parents were German Jews who emigrated from [[Berlin]] to the U.S. in 1939, on the eve of [[World War II]]. Winkler said that his parents came to the U.S. for a six-month business trip but knew they were never going back.&lt;ref name="EmmyTVLegends-Interview-2006" /&gt; His father smuggled the only assets the family had left (family jewels disguised as a box of chocolates) that he carried under his arm.&lt;ref name="WTFMaron-2015" /&gt; Although they did not keep [[kosher]], Winkler was raised in the traditions of [[Conservative Judaism]],&lt;ref name="Scotsman-ReadingTour-2009"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/welcome-to-my-world-henry-winkler-1-1352707 |title=Welcome to my world: Henry Winkler |work=[[The Scotsman]] |date=15 May 2009 |accessdate=9 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JewishChronicle-Pantomime-2014"&gt;{{cite web|last=Nathan|first=John|url=http://www.thejc.com/arts/arts-features/114603/happy-days-after-hard-knocks |title=Happy days after hard knocks |work= [[The Jewish Chronicle]] |date=9 January 2014 |accessdate=9 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but said that he was not religious as an adult. The family attended [[Congregation Habonim]], where his mother ran the [[Judaica]] shop. His parents were founding members of the temple.&lt;ref name="EmmyTVLegends-Interview-2006" /&gt; Winkler has a sister named Beatrice.&lt;ref name="WTFMaron-2015"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Maron|first1=Marc|title=Episode 593 - Henry Winkler|url=http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episodes/episode_593_-_henry_winkler|website=[[WTF with Marc Maron]]|accessdate=18 April 2015|publisher=Audio podcast interview|date=13 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Winkler has said that he was very anxious as a child because of his undiagnosed [[dyslexia]] and that he was considered to be "slow, stupid, not living up to my potential." As his father spoke 11 languages and could do math in his head, he did not understand Winkler's problems at school and why Winkler would celebrate a C grade. He also said that his relationship with his parents was strained, due at least partially to their attitude towards his undiagnosed dyslexia.&lt;ref name=YaleCenterforDyslexia&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dyslexia.yale.edu/Winkler.html |title=Henry Winkler, Actor, Producer, Author |work=The Yale Center for Dyslexia &amp; Creativity |accessdate=15 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father referred to him as "dumb dog" and often punished him for his difficulties in school.&lt;ref name="EmmyTVLegends-Interview-2006" /&gt; Winkler attended P.S. 87 on W. 78th Street which remains in operation today, and then graduated from [[McBurney School]] in 1963 which was located in Manhattan's [[Upper West Side]] neighborhood.&lt;ref name="NYDailyNews-Author-2014" /&gt;

Winkler said he did not graduate with his class because of his learning disability and problems with a geometry class, which he finally passed after attending summer school.&lt;ref name="Guardian-Zipzer-2014" /&gt; In 1967, Winkler received his [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] from [[Emerson College]].&lt;ref name="people.com"/&gt; At Emerson, he was a member of the Alpha Pi Theta Fraternity. In 1970, Winkler earned an [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] from the [[Yale School of Drama]]. In 1972 Winkler returned to New York City, auditioned for, and was cast in ''42 Seconds from Broadway''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ibdb.com/broadway-cast-staff/henry-winkler-74273|title=Henry Winkler – Broadway Cast &amp; Staff|first=|last=The Broadway League|date=|website=ibdb.com|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="people.com"/&gt; In 1978, Emerson awarded Winkler an honorary [[Doctor of Humane Letters|DHL]]. He has also received an honorary DHL from [[Austin College]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;"During his high school and college years, he studied in Lausanne, Switzerland and worked in a lumber mill in a small German town."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walker.co.uk/contributors/Henry-Winkler-8201.aspx|title=Walker Books - Henry Winkler|author=|date=|website=walker.co.uk|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hallmarkchannel.com/the-most-wonderful-time-of-the-year/cast/henry-winkler|title=Henry Winkler as Uncle Ralph  on The Most Wonderful Time of the Year|author=|date=|website=Hallmark Channel|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Career ==

=== Acting ===
Winkler said he had wanted to be an actor from the time he was a young child.&lt;ref name="EmmyTVLegends-Interview-2006" /&gt;

Winkler's first job on television was as an extra on a game show in New York. He received $10 for the role.&lt;ref name="EmmyTVLegends-Interview-2006" /&gt;

After working in theater and getting loved from a play in Washington, Winkler returned to New York City and supported himself by appearing in television commercials, one year doing more than 30. He was able to support himself with the commercial work so he could do theater for free at [[Manhattan Theater Club]].&lt;ref name="EmmyTVLegends-Interview-2006" /&gt;

He also appeared in 1973 in season four of ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'' in the episode "The Dinner Party" as Rhoda's date, Steve Waldman, and in episodes of ''[[The Bob Newhart Show]]'' and ''[[Rhoda]]''.

==== ''Happy Days'' ====
[[File:Happy days motorcycle richie fonzie 1977.JPG|right|thumb|225px|Richie ([[Ron Howard]]) takes a turn on Fonzie's motorcycle]]
Although Winkler had already shot the film ''[[The Lords of Flatbush]],'' he was relatively unknown. In 1973, a year before that film was released, producer Tom Miller was instrumental in Winkler getting cast for the role of Arthur Herbert Fonzarelli, nicknamed "The Fonz" or "[[Fonzie]]", in ''[[Happy Days]]'', which first aired in January 1974.&lt;ref name="People-HappyDaysFonz-1976"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Armstrong|first1=Lois|title=It's The Fonz! Ayyyy—the Fonz Is a Smash, but Henry Winkler Finds Some Nightmares in His Happy Daze|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20066500,00.html|accessdate=20 April 2015|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]|date=24 May 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For ''Happy Days'', director/producer [[Garry Marshall]] originally had in mind a completely opposite physical presence. Marshall sought to cast a hunky, blonde, Italian model-type male in the role of Fonzie, intended as a stupid [[Foil (literature)|foil]] to the real star, [[Ron Howard]]. However, when Winkler interpreted the role in auditions, Marshall immediately snapped him up. According to Winkler, "The Fonz was everybody I wasn't. He was everybody I wanted to be."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.oprah.com/tows/slide/200802/20080226/slide_20080226_350_107.jhtml Remarks to Oprah Winfrey] on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]],'' original airdate February 26, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Winkler's character, though remaining very much a rough-hewn outsider, gradually became the focus of the show as time passed (in particular after the departure of Ron Howard).&lt;ref name="DVDTalk-HappyDays-S3-2007"&gt;{{cite news|title=Happy Days - The Third Season|work= [[DVD Talk]]|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/31528/happy-days-the-third-season|accessdate=16 August 2010|date=27 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, ABC executives did not want to see the Fonz wearing leather, thinking the character would appear to be a criminal. The first 13 episodes show Winkler wearing two different kinds of [[windbreaker]] jackets, one of which was green. As Winkler said in a [[TV Land]] interview, "It's hard to look cool in a green windbreaker". Marshall argued with the executives about the jacket. In the end, a compromise was made. Winkler could only wear the leather jacket in scenes with his motorcycle, and from that point on, the Fonz was never without his motorcycle until season 2. ''Happy Days'' ended its run in 1984.

==== 1960s &amp; 1970s ====
From 1968 to 1972, Winkler appeared in 14 Yale Repertory Theater productions, including Shakespeare's "Coriolanus" (May 1968) &amp; "Macbeth" (February 1971), Gogol's "The Government Inspector" (February 1970), the World Premiere of "Gimpel the Fool" (an Isaac Bashevis Singer adaptation, October 1970) and "TWO BY BRECHT AND WEILL: The Little Mahagonny and The Seven Sins" (May–June 1971 &amp; January 1972).&lt;ref&gt;"www.library.yale.edu/humanities/theater/YRT_season_history_1966-1979.doc"&lt;/ref&gt;

During his decade on ''Happy Days'', Winkler also starred in a number of movies, including ''[[The Lords of Flatbush]]'' (1974), playing a troubled [[Vietnam-American War|Vietnam veteran]] in ''[[Heroes (1977 film)|Heroes]]'' (1977), ''[[The One and Only (1978 film)|The One and Only]]'' (1978), and ''[[An American Christmas Carol]]'' (TV movie, 1979).

That year Winkler was also narrator and executive producer of ''[[Who Are the DeBolts? And Where Did They Get Nineteen Kids?]]'', a [[documentary film]] about Dorothy and Bob DeBolt, an American couple who have [[adoption|adopted]] 14 children, some of whom are severely disabled war orphans (in addition to raising Dorothy's five biological children and Bob's biological daughter). The film won an [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature|Academy Award for Best Feature-length Documentary]] in 1978,&lt;ref name="NY Times"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/54399/Who-Are-the-DeBolts-And-Where-Did-They-Get-19-Kids-/details |title=NY Times: Who Are the DeBolts? And Where Did They Get Nineteen Kids? |accessdate=2008-11-15|work=NY Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [[Directors Guild of America Awards 1978|Directors Guild of America Award]] and the Humanitas Award for producer and director [[John Korty]] in 1979. A 50-minute version of the film shown on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in December 1978, earned a 1979 [[Emmy Award]] for Outstanding Individual Achievement - Informational Program and an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Informational Program for Winkler, Korty, and producers Warren Lockhart and Dan McCann.

Winkler was also one of the hosts of the 1979 [[Music for UNICEF Concert]].

==== 1980s ====
After ''Happy Days'' ended, Winkler concentrated on producing and directing. Within months of the program's cancellation, he and [[John Rich (director)|John Rich]] had collaborated to establish '''Winkler-Rich Productions;''' whenever Rich or Ann Daniels was uninvolved, his company was called '''Fair Dinkum Productions.''' He chose the name in a nod to Australia, where "[[Australian English vocabulary|fair dinkum]]" is a common Australian term suggesting a person or thing is "direct," "honest," "fair," or "authentic". He produced several television shows, including ''[[MacGyver (1985 TV series)|MacGyver]],'' ''[[So Weird]],'' and ''[[Mr. Sunshine (1986 TV series)|Mr. Sunshine]],'' with Rich; ''[[Sightings (TV series)|Sightings]],'' in which Daniels was involved; the 1985 made-for-television film ''[[Scandal Sheet (1985 film)|Scandal Sheet]],'' for which he was [[executive producer]]; and the game shows ''Wintuition'' and ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'' (the latter from 2002–2004, occasionally serving as a sub-announcer).

Winkler appeared in ''[[Night Shift (film)|Night Shift]]'', a 1982 American comedy film directed by [[Ron Howard]].

He also directed several movies including the [[Billy Crystal]] movie ''[[Memories of Me]]'' (1988) and ''[[Cop and a Half]]'' (1993) with [[Burt Reynolds]]. {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

==== 1990s ====
As the 1990s began, Winkler returned to acting. In 1991, he starred in the controversial made-for-television film ''[[Absolute Strangers]],'' as a husband forced to make a decision regarding his comatose wife and his unborn baby. In 1994, he returned to TV with the short-lived comedy series ''[[Monty (TV series)|Monty]]'' on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] and co-starred with [[Katharine Hepburn]] in the holiday TV movie ''[[One Christmas (film)|One Christmas]]''.&lt;ref name="Reel &amp; Unscripted-One Christmas"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lenox|first1=Mariana|title=One Christmas|url=http://reelandunscripted.com/one-christmas-1994/|accessdate=26 August 2015|work=Reel and Unscripted}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, his scene-stealing, uncredited role in ''[[Scream (1996 film)|Scream]]'' (as foul-mouthed high school principal [[List of Scream characters#Principal Himbry|Arthur Himbry]]) thrust his onscreen career back into the mainstream. Shortly afterwards, [[Adam Sandler]] asked Winkler to appear in ''[[The Waterboy]]'' (1998).

In 1999, he became an executive producer for the Disney Channel original series ''[[So Weird]]''. He would later make a special guest appearance in the second season's Halloween episode titled "Boo".

==== 2000s ====
''[[The Waterboy]]'' sparked a fast friendship, and ongoing professional relationship, between Sandler and Winkler. Winkler would go on to appear in at least three other Sandler films: ''[[Little Nicky]]'' (2000, where he plays himself, covered in bees), ''[[Click (2006 film)|Click]]'' (2006, as the protagonist's father), and ''[[You Don't Mess with the Zohan]]'' (2008, again playing himself). He also had small roles in movies such as ''[[Down to You]]'' (2000), ''[[Holes (film)|Holes]]'' (2003), and ''[[I Could Never Be Your Woman]]'' (2007).
He is known as a regular collaboeateur with Adam Sandler in his movies.

Winkler had a recurring role as incompetent lawyer [[Barry Zuckerkorn]] in the [[Fox Television]] comedy ''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]].'' In one episode, his character hopped over a dead shark lying on a pier,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Motherboy XXX |series=Arrested Development |season=2 |number=13 |network=Fox |date=2005-03-15 |time=11:30}}&lt;/ref&gt; a reference to his role in the origin of the phrase, from a two-part episode of ''Happy Days,'' "[[jumping the shark]]." After that episode, Winkler, in interviews, stated that he was the only person to have "jumped the shark" twice.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

When Winkler moved to [[CBS]] for one season to star in 2005–06's ''[[Out of Practice]],'' his role as the Bluth family lawyer on ''Arrested Development'' was taken over by ''Happy Days'' co-star [[Scott Baio]] in the fall of 2005, shortly before the acclaimed but [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen]]-challenged show ceased production.

Winkler has guest-starred on television series such as ''[[Numbers (TV series)|Numb3rs]]'', ''[[The Bob Newhart Show]]'' (as Miles Lascoe, a parolee just out of jail—he was in jail for armed robbery, twice), ''[[South Park]]'', ''[[The Practice]]'', ''[[The Drew Carey Show]]'', ''[[The Simpsons]]'' (playing a member of a biker gang—in one scene, he calls Marge "Mrs. S", a reference to Fonzie calling ''Happy Days'' matriarch Marion Cunningham "Mrs. C"), ''[[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit]]'', ''[[Third Watch]]'', ''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]]'', ''[[Crossing Jordan]]'', ''[[Family Guy]]'', ''[[King of the Hill]],'' and ''[[Kick Buttowski: Suburban Daredevil]]''.

The [[Weezer]] video for 1994's "[[Buddy Holly (song)|Buddy Holly]]" edited period footage of Henry Winkler as the Fonz, as well as a double shot from behind to create the illusion that Fonzie and other characters were watching Weezer as they performed in Arnold's restaurant. He appeared on [[KTTV]]'s ''[[Good Day L.A.]]'' and in one appearance, while substituting for [[Steve Edwards (talk show host)|Steve Edwards]], Winkler reunited with fellow ''Happy Days'' cast member [[Marion Ross]]. Winkler made a cameo appearance in the band [[Say Anything (band)|Say Anything]]'s video for "[[Wow, I Can Get Sexual Too]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1054077/say-anything-gets-sexy-with-fonzie-begins-new-cd |title=Say Anything Gets Sexy With Fonzie, Begins New CD |publisher=Billboard |date=2007-03-09 |accessdate=2014-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|zaOxwINr5GA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A close friend of actor [[John Ritter]], the two led a Broadway ensemble cast in [[Neil Simon]]'s ''[[The Dinner Party (play)|The Dinner Party]]'' in 2000. Winkler was reunited as a guest star on Ritter's sitcom ''[[8 Simple Rules|8 Simple Rules (for Dating my Teenage Daughter)]]'' in 2003 by Ritter's request. On September 11, Ritter became ill during filming, and unexpectedly died. A stunned, grief-stricken Winkler was interviewed by [[Mary Hart (TV personality)|Mary Hart]] of ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'' and various other entertainment news sources.
[[File:HenryWinklerAug08.jpg|thumb|right|187px|at the 2008 [[Fan Expo Canada]]]]
In 2008, he appeared in two Christmas movies, in the Hallmark Channel movie ''[[The Most Wonderful Time of the Year (film)|The Most Wonderful Time of the Year]]'' as a retired cop who plays matchmaker between his niece and a drifter he befriends, and in ''[[Merry Christmas, Drake &amp; Josh]]'' as the judge who orders Drake and Josh to give a young girl "the best Christmas ever" or be sent to jail. In 2009, Winkler provided the voice of Willard Deutschebog, a suicidal German teacher, in the Fox comedy series, ''[[Sit Down, Shut Up (U.S. TV series)|Sit Down, Shut Up]].''&lt;ref name="sdsu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sitdownshutupwiki.fox.com/?t=anon|title=Sit Down, Shut Up|publisher=Fox|accessdate=2009-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

So, instead of going with my dad and my mom and leaving Berlin, he stayed an extra day, and that night was taken by the Nazis."&lt;br&gt; - Henry Winkler, [[Better Late Than Never (TV series)|Better Late Than Never]] season 2, episode 4&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.springfieldspringfield.co.uk/view_episode_scripts.php?tv-show=better-late-than-never-2016&amp;episode=s02e04|title=Better Late Than Never (2016) s02e04 Episode Script|author=|date=|website=episode scripts|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Theater ===
Winkler's audition for the [[Yale School of Drama]] was to be a [[Shakespeare]] monologue, which he promptly forgot, so he made up his own Shakespeare monologue. Out of a class of 25 actors, 11 finished. During summers, he and his classmates opened a summer stock theater called New Haven Free Theater, putting on various plays including ''[[Woyzeck]],'' and an improv night. The company put on a production of ''The American Pig'' at the [[Joseph Papp Public Theater]] for the [[New York Shakespeare Festival Public Theater|New York Shakespeare Festival]]  in New York City. In June 1970, after graduating from Yale, Winkler was asked to be part of the [[Yale Repertory Theatre]] company, which included [[James Naughton]] and [[Jill Eikenberry]].&lt;ref name="EmmyTVLegends-Interview-2006" /&gt;

During his time there, [[Cliff Robertson]], who had seen him perform in [[East Hampton (town), New York|East Hampton]], offered him a part in his film ''[[The Great Northfield Minnesota Raid]]''. Winkler had to decline because he had no understudy for his current role, and thus was unable to leave. He stayed with the Yale Repertory Theatre for a year and a half.&lt;ref name="EmmyTVLegends-Interview-2006" /&gt;

In 1971, Winkler got a job at the [[Arena Stage]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] to work on the play, ''[[Moonchildren]],'' but was fired by director, [[Alan Schneider]].&lt;ref name="EmmyTVLegends-Interview-2006" /&gt;

In 1977, Winkler appeared in a TV special, "Henry Winkler Meets [[William Shakespeare]]," part of the ''[[CBS]] Festival of Lively Arts for Young People'' instructional series for children. With the assistance of [[Tom Aldredge]] as Shakespeare, Winkler, as himself, introduced an audience of children to ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'', ''[[Hamlet]],'' and ''[[Henry IV, Part 1|Henry IV]]'' and explained to them how Shakespeare's plays were produced at the [[Globe Theatre]] in [[London]] in the 17th century. He also played [[Romeo]] in the scene from ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' in which [[Romeo]] slays [[Tybalt]] in a sword duel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bufvc.ac.uk/shakespeare/index.php/title/av38217 |title=British Universities Film &amp; Video Council: "Henry Winkler Meets William Shakespeare" |publisher=Bufvc.ac.uk |date=1977-03-20 |accessdate=2014-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTimes-Stratford-1977"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9A04E0D8103BE334BC4053DFB466838C669EDE|last1=Klemesrud|first1=Judy|title=From Leather Jacket to Tights: The Fonz Makes It in Stratford|accessdate=20 April 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=8 February 1977|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Pantomime ====
Winkler appeared in his first [[pantomime]] at the [[New Wimbledon Theatre]], [[London]] in 2006, playing [[Captain Hook]] in ''[[Peter Pan]],'' replacing [[David Hasselhoff]] who pulled out when he was offered a TV role by [[Simon Cowell]]. He reprised the role in [[Woking]] for Christmas 2007. For the 2008/2009 season, he played [[Captain Hook]] at the [[Milton Keynes Theatre]] and donned the hook once again for the 2009/2010 panto season at the [[Liverpool Empire Theatre|Liverpool Empire]].&lt;ref name="NYTimes-Pantomime-2009"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lyall|first1=Sarah|title=Topsy-Turvy Christmas Foolery|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/22/theater/22panto.html|accessdate=20 April 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=21 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2013, Winkler reprised his role of Captain Hook in ''Peter Pan'' at the Richmond Theatre in South West London.

In the 2013 Broadway season, Winkler, [[Cheyenne Jackson]], [[Alicia Silverstone]], and [[Ari Graynor]] were announced to star in the David West Read play ''The Performers'' opening Nov 14, 2012, at The [[Longacre Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadway.com/buzz/163136/cheyenne-jackson-and-henry-winkler-confirmed-to-star-in-broadway-porn-play-the-performers/|title=Cheyenne Jackson and Henry Winkler Confirmed to Star in Broadway Porn Play The Performers|work=Broadway.com| date=2012-07-26|accessdate= 2012-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Author ===
In 1998, Winkler's agent at [[Creative Artists Agency|CAA]], Alan Berger, suggested Winkler write a children's book about dyslexia, but Winkler didn't think that he would be able to write because of his struggles with the learning disability. Berger was persistent, and a few years later, in 2003, he again suggested Winkler write. Winkler said yes. Berger suggested he co-write with author [[Lin Oliver]].&lt;ref name="WTFMaron-2015" /&gt; Winkler has since written 19 books.&lt;ref name="HReporter-RoyalPainsSecrets-2011" /&gt;

==== Hank Zipzer books ====
Since 2003, Winkler has collaborated with [[Lin Oliver]] on a series of children's books about a 4th grade boy, [[Hank Zipzer]], who is [[dyslexic]]. Winkler also has the learning disability, which was not diagnosed until he was 31 and his stepson Jed, who was in the third grade, was tested;&lt;ref name="shatner"&gt;"Henry Winkler". ''[[Shatner's Raw Nerve]]'', 13 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; the dyslexia was an unhappy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greatschools.org/gk/articles/henry-winklers-dyslexic-hero/|title=Henry Winkler's Dyslexic Hero Gives Kids With Learning Difficulties the Last Laugh – Talking about LDs|publisher=GreatSchools|accessdate=27 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; part of his childhood. Winkler has published 17 books about his hero Zipzer, the "world's greatest underachiever."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mlive.com/entertainment/grpress/index.ssf?/base/entertainment-2/120504699222730.xml&amp;coll=6 |title=Grand Rapids Press |publisher=Mlive.com |date=2011-11-01 |accessdate=2012-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717091112/http://www.mlive.com/entertainment/grpress/index.ssf?%2Fbase%2Fentertainment-2%2F120504699222730.xml&amp;coll=6 |archivedate=2012-07-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2008, Winkler joined [[First News]] on their annual Reading Tour of schools where he read excerpts from his Hank Zipzer books. This has since become an annual tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://info.firstnews.co.uk|title=First News Children's Newspaper|publisher=[[Firstnews.co.uk]]|accessdate=2010-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, he donated books to Holy Rosary School, PA. The school was flooded out by [[Tropical Storm Lee (2011)|Tropical Storm Lee]].

==Personal life==
Winkler has been married to his wife Stacey (formerly Weitzman; née Furstman)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Boughton |first=Victoria |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20134304,00.html |title=Happy Daze - Personal Success, Where Are They Now?, Henry Winkler |publisher=People.com |date=2001-05-07 |accessdate=2014-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; since May 5, 1978; with her, he has two children, Zoe Emily (b. 1980), a pre-school teacher,&lt;ref name="LAConf-Daughter-Zoe-2009"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Preskill|first1=Adam|title=The Fonz's Daughter Chooses Her Own Path|url=http://la-confidential-magazine.com/living/articles/class-act|accessdate=20 April 2015|work=[[Los Angeles Confidential]]|date=October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTimes-Daughter-Zoe-Wed-2009"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Segre|first1=Francesca|title=Vows: Zoe Winkler and Robert Reinis|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/19/fashion/weddings/19VOWS.html|accessdate=20 April 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=18 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Max Winkler (director)|Max Daniel]] (b. August 18, 1983), a director. Winkler also has a stepson, Jed Weitzman, from Stacey's previous marriage with [[Howard Weitzman]].

Winkler is a cousin of actor [[Richard Belzer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tvguide.com/PhotoGallery/Surprising-Celebrity-Family-1073313/1073326 |title=Henry Winkler Pictures, Richard Belzer Photos - Photo Gallery: Surprising Celebrity Family Ties |last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher=[[TV Guide]] |accessdate=October 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winkler is the godfather of [[Bryce Dallas Howard]], daughter of ''[[Happy Days]]'' co-star [[Ron Howard]]. Henry was the 9th King of the Bacchus, Mardi Gras, Parade in New Orleans in 1977; the theme was "Happily Ever After".

Winkler said he was named after his Uncle Helmut, who did not make it out of Germany during World War II.&lt;ref name="EmmyTVLegends-Interview-2006" /&gt; His middle name, Franklin, was in honor of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]].&lt;ref name="EmmyTVLegends-Interview-2006" /&gt;

He is an avid [[fly fisherman]], which he often does in [[Montana]]. On the rewards of this hobby, Winkler said: "The repetition of it, the sound of the water, I find it to be totally draining. Anything that bothers you is completely washed from your body. I see fly-fishing as a washing machine for your brain. My technique is still ugly as sin. But somehow I get the fish."&lt;ref name="HReporter-RoyalPainsSecrets-2011" /&gt; He has also said "I have never eaten a trout in a restaurant let alone take it out of the river."

== Works and publications ==
In addition to the Hank Zipzer series, which has 17 books, Winkler has written another series with Lin Oliver called ''Here's Hank,'' a prequel to the Zipzer stories.&lt;ref name="NYDailyNews-Author-2014"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stebner|first1=Beth|title=How dyslexia made 'Happy Days' star Henry Winkler an author|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/dyslexia-made-henry-winkler-author-article-1.1617440|accessdate=20 April 2015|work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|date=23 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
