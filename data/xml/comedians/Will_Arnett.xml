==Career==
In February 1996, Arnett made his first television pilot with [[Kevin Pollak]] and his wife, Lucy Webb, for [[CBS]], that was not picked up.&lt;ref name="twop4" /&gt; In 1999, Arnett starred in another pilot for ''[[The Mike O'Malley Show]]'' on [[NBC]] as the protagonist's friend Jimmy. The show was picked up, but was canceled after only two episodes. Arnett has referred to 2000, the year after that show was cancelled, as "the darkest year of [his] life" and he admits that he "didn't get a lot of work" and "drank those years away."&lt;ref name="twop4"/&gt; In summer 2000, a friend helped pull Arnett out of his battle with alcoholism, and he began to get his career back on track.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chun|first=Wing|title=Page 5|url=http://www.televisionwithoutpity.com/show/the_will_arnett_interview.php?page=5|work="JASON IS SO MUCH LIKE A SISTER TO ME"|accessdate=March 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, Arnett was cast in the [[CBS]] television pilot, ''[[Loomis (TV pilot)|Loomis]]'' as the slacker brother of a local news reporter ([[Cheri Oteri]]), that was not picked up. In 2002, Arnett was cast in a fourth television pilot which was for the [[CBS]] sitcom ''[[Still Standing (TV series)|Still Standing]]'', which was picked up and ran for several seasons, but his character was cut from the series after the pilot.&lt;ref name="variety" /&gt; Arnett became so frustrated, after his fourth failed pilot, that he "swore off pilots"&lt;ref name="variety"/&gt; altogether, until his agent persuaded him to audition for the pilot for ''Arrested Development''.

In 2003, Arnett found mainstream success in television when he played [[Gob Bluth|George Oscar "Gob" Bluth II]] in the [[Fox television network|Fox]] comedy series, ''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]]'' and in 2006 he was nominated for his first [[Emmy Award|Emmy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/will-arnett|title=Will Arnett Emmy Nominated| publisher=Emmys.com| accessdate=January 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show was cancelled after three seasons due to low ratings, despite its critical acclaim and [[cult following]].&lt;ref name="sfgate"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/11/14/DDG4NFMUAI1.DTL|title=Die-hard ''Arrested Development'' fans already feeling sting of loss|accessdate=November 23, 2005|work=The San Francisco Chronicle| first=Tim| last=Goodman| date=November 14, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also played Max the Magician in ''[[Sesame Street]]'', in a nod to Gob Bluth's penchant for using [[Europe (band)|Europe]]'s "[[The Final Countdown (song)|The Final Countdown]]" during his magic shows. According to a 2006 interview with the [[Los Angeles Times]], Arnett's two favorite episodes of the show were "[[Pier Pressure (Arrested Development)|Pier Pressure]]" and "[[Afternoon Delight (Arrested Development episode)|Afternoon Delight]]".&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;[http://goldderby.latimes.com/awards_goldderby/2006/07/will_arnett_emm.html Transcript: Our chat session with Will Arnett], ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'', 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; His exposure on ''Arrested Development'' led to a number of larger roles in feature films. Though having worked in drama, his role for ''Arrested Development'' is still comedy, and he often portrays smug antagonists.

===Voice work===

Arnett's distinctive gravelly voice has earned him [[voice-over]] work for [[CBS]] television promos, film trailers and numerous advertisements, including [[Lamisil]] medication. Perhaps most recognizable is Arnett's voice saying, "It's not more than you need, just more than you're used to" in ads for [[GMC (General Motors division)|GMC]] trucks.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004715/otherworks "Will Arnett – Other works"], IMDb, 2007-04-22.

The production featured a [[Ford Mustang]] as K.I.T.T. Since Arnett had a previous long standing relationship with competitor automaker [[General Motors]] as the voice for GMC Trucks commercials, GM asked Arnett to pull out of the project.
