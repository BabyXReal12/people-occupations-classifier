'''Neil Mullarkey''' (born 30 November 1961) is an English actor, writer and comedian.

==Early life and education==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=March 2016}}
Mullarkey studied at [[Robinson College, Cambridge]] where he was a member of the [[Footlights]] and was Junior Treasurer during [[Tony Slattery]]'s term as president. He became president in 1982 with [[Nick Hancock]], [[Steve Punt]] and [[Hugh Dennis]] as his contemporaries. Mullarkey formed ''Hancock &amp; Mullarkey'' with Hancock, performing their act (which consisted of spoofing television shows' title sequences to that show's accompanying theme music) several times on television. This included ''[[Doctor Who]]'', ''[[Kojak]]'', and ''[[Dad's Army]]''.

==Career==
Mullarkey has been in a double act with [[Tony Hawks]] called the Timid Twins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allthatmullarkey.com/doubleacts.html|title=Neil Mullarkey with Mike Myers, Nick Hancock, Tony Hawks – Double Acts Archive|work=allthatmullarkey.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1980s, he teamed up with [[Mike Myers]] as 'Mullarkey and Myers'. They would perform sketches based on their shared love of cartoons, B-movies and bad TV. They played around the burgeoning London pub circuit, particularly at the George IV in [[Chiswick]], where they often shared the bill with the young [[Hugh Grant]], then plying his trade in the ''Jockeys of Norfolk'' revue. As their fame increased, Mullarkey and Myers toured the UK, ending in a sold-out season at the [[Edinburgh Festival]].

The two appeared as 'The Sound Asleep Club' on TV-am's 'Wide Awake Club', a children's TV show hosted at the time by [[Tommy Boyd]]. Mike eventually returned to Toronto, but Mullarkey would briefly join him to revive  'Mullarkey and Myers' in Canada. Later still, he appeared in Myers' début in ''[[Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery]]'', as the Customs Officer who freaks Austin out with his penis enlarger. (He also appeared again in ''[[Austin Powers in Goldmember|Goldmember]]'' and helped [[Mike Myers]] with uncredited rewrites of ''[[So I Married An Axe Murderer]]''&lt;ref name="Neil Mullarkey Website"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neilmullarkey.com/neil_mullarkey.html|publisher=neilmullarkey.com|title=Neil Mullarkey details|accessdate=19 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;).
