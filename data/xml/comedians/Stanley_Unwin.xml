'''Stanley Unwin''' (7 June 1911 &amp;ndash; 12 January 2002),&lt;ref&gt;GRO Register of Deaths: JAN 2002 25B 14 DAVENTRY &amp;ndash; Stanley Unwin, DoB = 7 June 1911, aged 90.&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes billed as '''Professor Stanley Unwin''', was an English [[comedian]], actor and comic writer.

He invented his own comic language, "Unwinese",&lt;ref name="Stevens"&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; referred to in the film ''[[Carry On Regardless]]'' (1961) as "[[gobbledygook]]". Unwinese was a corrupted form of English in which many of the words were altered in playful and humorous ways, as in its description of [[Elvis Presley]] and his contemporaries as being "wasp-waist and swivel-hippy". Unwin claimed that the inspiration came from his mother, who once told him that on the way home she had "falolloped (fallen) over" and "grazed her kneeclabbers".

==Early life==
Unwin's parents, Ivan Oswald Unwin and his wife Jessie Elizabeth, {{née}} Brand, emigrated from the United Kingdom to South Africa in the early 1900s. Their son was born in [[Pretoria]] in 1911. Following his father's death in 1914, Unwin's mother arranged for the family to return to England. By 1919, Unwin had been sent to the [[National Children's Home]] in [[Congleton]], [[Cheshire]]. In the late 1920s, he studied radio, television and languages at [[Regent Street Polytechnic]] in [[London]].

In 1937, he married his wife Frances, with whom he had two daughters and a son. Unwin later stated that Unwinese had its roots in enlivening the bedtime stories that he used to tell his children. In 1940, he was given a job in transmitter maintenance for the [[BBC]], and was assigned to the [[Borough Hill]] transmitting station in [[Daventry]]. Unwin, Frances and their nine-month-old daughter, Marion, moved to [[Long Buckby]] in [[Northamptonshire]], where Unwin would reside for the rest of his life.

==Comedy career==
Unwin's early career and training introduced him to wireless and radio communication, and this, coupled with work in the BBC's War Reporting Unit from about 1944, ultimately proved to be his passage into the media.

While based in [[Birmingham]] from 1947 to 1951, Unwin made his first, accidental, transmission. While testing equipment, he handed the microphone to broadcaster [[Frederick Robert Buckley|F.R. "Buck" Buckley]], who [[ad-libbed]] a spoof commentary about an imaginary sport called "Fasche". [[Frederick Robert Buckley|Buckley]] then encouraged Unwin to join in and introduced him as "Codlington Corthusite", handing back the microphone{{Spaced ndash}}whereupon Unwin continued in Unwinese. The recording was played back to two BBC producers, who added sound effects; it was eventually broadcast on [[Pat Dixon]]'s ''Mirror of the Month'' programme and, after receiving a positive response, culminated in another sketch in which Unwin, playing a man from [[Atlantis]], was interviewed about life in the sunken city. The broadcast produced Unwin's first fan mail, from [[Joyce Grenfell]], who had been impressed by his performance. Since Grenfell was Unwin's heroine, the encouragement gave Unwin a boost and he was inspired to break into show business.

After the war, while in [[Egypt]] and recording a series of shows by [[Frankie Howerd]], Unwin was pushed onto the stage and told to "do a turn" after the actor suddenly fell ill. Unwin's next major breakthrough came when producer [[Roy Speer]] introduced him to the comedian [[Ted Ray (comedian)|Ted Ray]]. Once Ray had heard Unwin talking, he said simply: "I want him in the series"{{Spaced ndash}}namely, ''The Spice of Life'', co-starring [[June Whitfield]] and [[Kenneth Connor]].&lt;ref name="Stevens"/&gt; During the mid-1950s, Unwin performed in about a dozen shows for Speer and made the acquaintance of Johnnie Riscoe and his daughter, Patsy, who would become his managers for the rest of his career. By the end of the 1950s, Unwin had ventured into the film industry, being given a part in the [[Cardew Robinson]] film ''Fun at St Fanny's'' (1956).

In 1968 Unwin was invited to narrate "Happiness Stan", a six song [[fairy tale]] about a boy of the same name, taking up the entire side two of the [[Small Faces]]' album ''[[Ogdens' Nut Gone Flake]]'', which reached number 1 in the [[UK Albums Chart]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Small Faces, Ogden's Nut Gone Flake | publisher = [[BBC]] | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/release/b3jw/ | accessdate = 17 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, Unwin appeared in [[Gerry Anderson]]'s "[[Supermarionation]]" TV series ''[[The Secret Service]]'', both in person and as the voice of the puppet character Father Stanley Unwin, whose appearance was based on him. Episodes typically comprised one or more scenes in which the character of Unwin would attempt to baffle opponents with his gobbledegook. When [[Lew Grade]], Anderson's financial backer and head of distributor [[ITC Entertainment|ITC]], was introduced to the Unwinese dialogue, he cancelled the production on the basis that viewers would not understand what Unwin was saying, despite the fact that such confusion was intentional.

Though less active in later decades, Unwin continued to make occasional appearances. In the 1970s, he appeared on ''The [[Max Bygraves]] Show'' on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]], sometimes speaking normally and sometimes in gobbledegook. In the final episode, Bygraves tested a number of gobbledegook phrases on Unwin, who claimed that he could not understand them.  In 1985, Unwin recorded with [[Suns of Arqa]] on their album ''[[Ark of the Arqans]]'', providing spoken word accompaniment in Unwinese on the first three tracks.  In 1987, he recorded again with Suns of Arqa on their track "Erasmus Meets The Earthling", featured on their album ''[[Seven (Suns of Arqa album)|Seven]]'', and a remixed version of this track was released again in the 1990s.  He appeared as himself in a hospital scene of [[Inside Victor Lewis-Smith]]. In 1994, Unwin collaborated with British [[dance music]] act [[Wubble-U]] on their single "Petal"; on its re-release in 1998, the track ranked number 55 in the UK Chart. In 1998, Unwin made a cameo appearance in the [[Aardman Animations]] series ''[[Rex the Runt]]'', as an accountant who speaks largely in fairly standard English, occasionally lapsing inexplicably into Unwinese.

===Unwinese===
Unwinese, also known as "Basic Engly Twenty Fido", was an ornamented and mangled form of English in which many of the words were corrupted in a playful and humorous manner. Unwin's performances could be hilarious yet disorientating, although the meaning and context were always conveyed in a disguised and picturesque style. Unwinese may have been inspired in part by [[Lewis Carroll]]'s 1871 poem ''[[Jabberwocky]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bikwil.com/Vintage35/Stanley-Unwin.html Carroll's influence on Unwin] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080414055551/http://www.bikwil.com/Vintage35/Stanley-Unwin.html |date=14 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacy==
[[File:Long Buckby-Grave of Stanley Unwin - geograph.org.uk - 1707018.jpg|thumb|Unwin's grave in [[Long Buckby]]]]

Unwin died at Danetre Hospital in [[Daventry]] on 12 January 2002. He is buried in the churchyard at [[Long Buckby]], with Frances, who pre-deceased him. Their gravestone bears the epitaph, "Reunitey in the heavenly-bode{{Spaced ndash}}Deep Joy!".

A thanksgiving service was held at St Lawrence's Church in Long Buckby and ended with a rendering of "[[Bye Bye Blackbird]]" by John Percival and friends. The [[valediction]] had been prepared by Unwin's family in his own style: "Goodly Byelode loyal peeploders! Now all gatherymost to amuse it and have a tilty elbow or a nice cuffle-oteedee{{Spaced ndash}}Oh Yes!"

[[Suns of Arqa]] released a tribute album to Unwin (entitled "Tributey") following his death, featuring a selection of his works with the band over the years, as well as various interviews.

Unwin's work is considered to have been a significant influence on the two books written by [[John Lennon]]: ''[[In His Own Write]]'' (1964) and ''[[A Spaniard in the Works]]'' (1965).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Chris |last=Ingham |title=The Rough Guide To The Beatles |page=220 |publisher=Rough Guides Ltd |edition=3rd |date=2009 |isbn=978-1-84836-525-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
