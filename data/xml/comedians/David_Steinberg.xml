'''David Steinberg'''  {{post-nominals|country=CAN|CM}} (born August 9, 1942) is a Canadian comedian, actor, writer, director, and author. At the height of his popularity, during the late 1960s and early 1970s, he was one of the best-known comics in the United States. He appeared on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' more than 130 times (second only to [[Bob Hope]] in number of appearances) and served as guest host 12 times, the youngest person ever to guest-host.&lt;ref name = Northern/&gt; Steinberg directed several films and episodes of television [[situation comedy|situation comedies]], including ''[[Seinfeld]]'', ''[[Friends]]'', ''[[Mad About You]]'', ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'', ''[[The Golden Girls]]'', and ''[[Designing Women]]''.

Since 2012, Steinberg has hosted the interview program ''[[Inside Comedy]]'' on the [[Showtime (TV channel)|Showtime]] network.

==Early life==
Born the son of Yasha, a strict, [[Romanians|Romanian]]-born [[rabbi]], and Ruth Steinberg in [[Winnipeg]], Manitoba, Canada, David initially studied theology in Israel.&lt;ref name=Northern&gt;{{cite web

There he performed with [[Robert Klein]], [[Fred Willard]], [[Peter Boyle]], and [[Joe Flaherty]]. He remained with the group for six years.&lt;ref name=Northern/&gt; In 1972, Steinberg was best man at the wedding of his friend, the gangster [[Crazy Joe Gallo]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=BITp-iOtCPQC&amp;pg=PA175#v=onepage Book of David, Page 175]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
One of Steinberg's most notorious performances was in October 1968 on ''[[The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour]]'', where he gave satirical sermons. The sketch caused [[CBS]] to receive a record number of complaints, and, as a result, the network instituted a policy of providing local stations with a closed-circuit telecast of each episode ahead of time so they could choose whether or not to air it.&lt;ref name=dangerous&gt;{{cite book| publisher=Touchstone| title=Dangerously Funny: The Uncensored Story of "The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour" | isbn=1-4391-0116-7 | author=Bianculli, David | date=December 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Smothers Brothers]] were told by the network that they could have Steinberg on the show again on the condition that he would not repeat the sermons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher=CBSNews.com| title=David Steinberg Just Wants to Talk Comedy| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/03/11/sunday/main2556729.shtml| date=March 11, 2007| accessdate=2007-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, [[Tom Smothers|Tommy Smothers]] asked Steinberg to do it again, and he gave a sermon in which he said "The Old Testament scholars say that Jonah was swallowed by a whale. The Gentiles, the New Testament scholars say, 'Hold it, Jews, no.'  They literally grabbed the Jews by the Old Testament." This incident contributed to the cancellation of the show. The Jonah sketch was never aired by CBS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher=npr.org| title=The Book of David: Paging Mr. Steinberg| url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=13749298| date=August 20, 2007| accessdate=2007-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steinberg appeared in two Broadway flops,''[[Little Murders]]'' and ''Carry Me Back to [[Morningside Heights]]'', which both closed within one week in 1967 and 1968, respectively.

Steinberg was the most frequent host of the pop and rock music [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television show, ''[[The Music Scene (TV series)|The Music Scene]],'' 1969–1970. The show featured performances by [[Joe Cocker]] and [[Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young|CSN&amp;Y]]. In 1972, Steinberg wrote and starred in ''[[The David Steinberg Show]]'' in the United States as a five-week summer replacement sketch comedy show.&lt;ref name = IMDb&gt;{{cite web| title=The David Steinberg Show at IMDb| url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068063/| accessdate=2010-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same time, [[TV Guide]] labelled Steinberg "offbeat, racy, outrageous, and establishment-baiting – all of which makes him a particular favorite among the young and disenchanted."&lt;ref name = Northern/&gt;

In 1975 Steinberg hosted ''Noonday'', a short-lived half-hour midday talk show on [[NBC]].

In 1976, Steinberg returned to Canada to produce a second show called ''The David Steinberg Show''.  This series was a hybrid sitcom/variety show, modelled loosely on ''[[The Jack Benny Program]]'' in that the plots centred on the star (Steinberg) and his cast trying to put together another instalment of their variety show.  Amongst the regular cast were future ''SCTV'' stars [[Joe Flaherty]], [[John Candy]], [[Dave Thomas (actor)|Dave Thomas]], and [[Martin Short]]. SCTV's [[Andrea Martin]] also appeared on the show, but not as a regular.  ''SCTV'' premiered the same week as ''The David Steinberg Show'', and ran for six seasons; ''The David Steinberg Show'' lasted only one season.

Steinberg performed some notable stand-up comedy during the 1970s as well, including ''The Incredible Shrinking God'' (LP MCA 73013, 1968), which contains ten of his comedic sermons and mini-sermons recorded live during his stand-up routine at Second City. He also hosted the 1977 Juno Awards show.&lt;ref name="Inc.1977"&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin Melhuish|title=Juno 1977 |work=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ayMEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA76|date=23 April 1977|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|pages=76–|issn=0006-2510}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was inducted into [[Canada's Walk of Fame]] in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Canada's Walk of Fame: David Steinberg: actor, comedian, director |url=http://www.canadaswalkoffame.com/inductee/david-steinberg |year=2003 |accessdate=2010-01-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100203041308/http://www.canadaswalkoffame.com/inductee/david-steinberg |archivedate=February 3, 2010 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently (2005–2007), Steinberg hosted ''[[Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg]]'', an informal, interview-style show in which he talks with famous comedians and comic actors, for two seasons on [[TV Land]] in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sit Down with David Steinberg |url=http://www.tvland.com/originals/sitdown/season2/ |accessdate=2007-06-11 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070529232052/http://www.tvland.com/originals/sitdown/season2/ |archivedate=May 29, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first season featured [[Mike Myers (actor)|Mike Myers]], [[Larry David]], [[Jon Lovitz]], [[Martin Short]], [[Bob Newhart]], and [[George Lopez]]. The second season featured [[Jerry Seinfeld]], [[Robin Williams]], [[Roseanne Barr]], [[Jon Stewart]], [[Garry Shandling]] and [[Ray Romano]]. The program was filmed before an audience at [[UCLA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Sit Down Comedy With David Steinberg (2007)| url=http://thedavidsteinberg.com/news.htm| year=2007| accessdate=2010-01-12| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110115135920/http://thedavidsteinberg.com/news.htm| archivedate=January 15, 2011| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His first book, ''The Book of David'' ({{ISBN|0743272323}}), was published in June 2007 by [[Simon &amp; Schuster]].

In 2010, he directed and produced the Canadian cable comedy series ''[[Living in Your Car]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/April2010/06/c8018.html "HBO Canada presents Living in Your Car, one man's karmic fall from the high life to the highway"]. ''[[Canada NewsWire]]'', April 6, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The David Steinberg Show==
The first iteration of ''The David Steinberg Show'' ran on CBS television in the United States for five weeks in the summer of 1972.  This series was an hour-long sketch comedy show, in which Steinberg was the only regular. Other sketch roles were played by the two or three guest stars Steinberg would introduce each week.&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, Tim and Earle Marsh: ''The Complete Directory To Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows, 1946-present, 8th edition'', Ballantine Books, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Four years later, Steinberg starred in a comedy/variety series also called ''The David Steinberg Show'', which was produced in Canada for the [[CTV Network]] and was seen in the US in syndication.  This series was partly modelled on ''[[The Jack Benny Program]]'', in that it was largely about the behind-the-scenes adventures of the cast of a variety show and their friends.  Each episode included material from the "variety show" that was being produced, as well as backstage segments.&lt;ref&gt;Hicks, Wesseley: ''Unique David Steinberg Show'', Ottawa Citizen, June 5, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;

The series ran during 1976/77 television season, and lasted 26 episodes.  The supporting cast featured a number of people who would go on to greater fame on ''[[Second City Television|SCTV]]'', and many ''Steinberg'' cast members were, in fact, simultaneously working on the first season of ''SCTV'', which debuted the same week as ''The David Steinberg Show''.  ''SCTV'' cast members doing "double duty" on ''Steinberg'' included [[Joe Flaherty]], [[Dave Thomas (actor)|Dave Thomas]] and [[John Candy]], with Candy actually doing "triple duty" as he was also a cast member on the CBC sitcom ''[[Coming Up Rosie]]'' during this period. [[Martin Short]], also a ''Steinberg'' regular, would later become a cast member of ''SCTV'', but not until 1982.  (Amusingly, after he joined ''SCTV'', Short would actually end up portraying Steinberg in an ''SCTV'' sketch.)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sctvguide.ca/episodes/sctv_s54.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

''SCTV'' stalwart [[Andrea Martin]] also appeared in a few episodes of ''The David Steinberg Show'', but not as a regular.

The cast of the 1976/77 edition of ''The David Steinberg Show'' included:

*'''David Steinberg''' as himself, the genial but beleaguered host of a variety show. 
*'''[[Bill Saluga]]''' as Vinnie DeMilo and as [[Ray J. Johnson]].  Vinnie is the owner of the nearby "Hello Deli", and David's chief confidante.  The cigar-chomping Ray J. Johnson, a separate character, occasionally drops by the show (but never the deli) to interrupt David's monologues with his own rambling observations.
*'''[[Trudy Young]]''' as Margie, the friendly Hello Deli waitress.
*'''John Candy''' as Spider Reichman, the wide-eyed, hippie-ish bandleader.  Candy also provided the voice of Vinnie's cook, who is frequently heard in the offstage Hello Deli kitchen, but is never seen onscreen.
*'''Joe Flaherty''' as Kirk Dirkman, a deliveryman who rather improbably becomes a network executive overseeing David's show. 
*'''Martin Short''' as Johnny Del Bravo, David's obnoxious, narcissistic, talent-free cousin who is the "featured singer" on the show.
*'''Dave Thomas''' as James MacGregor, the show's excitable Scottish security guard.
*'''Blue''' as Bambi Markowitz, David's ditzy, incompetent secretary/assistant.

==Personal life==
Steinberg has been married twice. He married Judy Marcione in 1973 and they had two daughters. They divorced in 1997 after 24 years of marriage.&lt;ref&gt;http://judysteinberg.com/content/author.asp&lt;/ref&gt; Steinberg then married Robyn Todd.&lt;ref&gt;http://robyntodd.net/book_01.html  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090515160030/http://robyntodd.net/book_01.html |date=May 15, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discography==

==Awards==
Steinberg has received five [[Emmy Award]] nominations, winning two as one of the writers of [[Academy Awards]] programs in 1991 and 1992. He received a [[CableACE Award]] in 1992 for his stand up comedy ''Cats, Cops and Stuff.''  He has been nominated for the [[Directors Guild of America Award]] ([[Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing – Comedy Series|for Outstanding Directing – Comedy Series]]) twice: first in 1991 for the ''[[Seinfeld]]'' episode, ''[[The Tape]]'', and again in 1996 for the ''[[Mad About You]]'' episode, ''The Finale: Parts II and III'', and has been nominated for a [[Canadian Comedy Award]] (2000) and a [[Gemini Award|Gemini]] (2001), as well.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0825731/awards Awards for David Steinberg]. IMDb. Retrieved on 2007-07-07.&lt;/ref&gt; His parody of the novel ''[[Ragtime (novel)|Ragtime]]'' won him a Playboy Humor Award.&lt;ref name = Northern/&gt; In 2003, he was inducted into [[Canada's Walk of Fame]].

In December 2016, Steinberg was named a [[Member of the Order of Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/order-canada-newest-appointees-2016-150-1.3916634 "Order of Canada's newest appointees include Paralympian, Supreme Court judge and astrophysicist"].
