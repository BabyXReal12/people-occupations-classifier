'''Janet Vivian''' "'''Jan'''" '''Hooks'''&lt;ref name="liteseyfhobit"/&gt; (April 23, 1957&amp;nbsp;– October 9, 2014) was an American actress and comedian best known for her work on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', where she was a repertory player from 1986 to 1991, and continued making cameo appearances until 1994. Her subsequent work included a regular role on the final two seasons of ''[[Designing Women]]'', a recurring role on ''[[3rd Rock from the Sun]]'' and a number of other roles in film and television.

==Early life==
Hooks was born and raised in [[Decatur, Georgia]], where she attended Canby Lane Elementary School and [[Towers High School]]. In 1974, she moved to [[Fort Myers, Florida]], her junior year when her father, a [[Sears]] employee, was transferred.  At this point, Hooks attended [[Cypress Lake High School]] and made her stage debut in a high school play and graduated in 1975. She attended [[Edison State College]] where she majored in Theatre, but opted to leave before completion, to pursue acting full time.

==Career==
She began her career as a member of the [[Los Angeles]]-based comedy troupe [[The Groundlings]] and in an Atlanta nightclub act called The Wits End Players.&lt;ref name="nytobit"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/10/arts/television/jan-hooks-of-saturday-night-live-fame-is-dead-at-57-.html|last=Keepnews|first=Peter|title=Jan Hooks of ‘Saturday Night Live’ Fame Is Dead at 57|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 9, 2014|accessdate=October 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1980 to 1981, she appeared in ''[[Tush (TV series)|Tush]]'' on [[Ted Turner]]'s television station WTBS, which eventually became [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=October 9, 2014|title='Saturday Night Live' Vet Jan Hooks Dead at 57|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/celebrity/saturday-night-live-vet-jan-hooks-dead-57-n222501|publisher=[[NBC News]]|accessdate=October 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She gained notice in the early 1980s on the [[HBO]] comedy series ''[[Not Necessarily the News]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Rothman, Michael|date= October 9, 2014|title=Jan Hooks Dead at 57: Comedian Starred on 'Saturday Night Live' in the 1980's|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/jan-hooks-dead-57-comedian-starred-saturday-night/story?id=26086504|publisher=[[ABC News]]|accessdate=October 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hooks made guest appearances on ''Comedy Break with Mack and Jamie'' in the mid-1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Wright, Megh|date=July 5, 2011|url=http://splitsider.com/2011/07/saturday-nights-children-jan-hooks-1986-1991|title=Saturday Night's Children: Jan Hooks (1986–1991)|publisher=Splitsider|accessdate=October 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hooks was considered for ''SNL'' in 1985, but was passed over by the show's producers in favor of [[Joan Cusack]]. After the show's 1985–1986 season was deemed a ratings disaster and put on the chopping block for cancellation, returning producer [[Lorne Michaels]] offered Hooks a contract in 1986, along with new recruits [[Dana Carvey]] and [[Phil Hartman]], among others. They helped put the show back in the national spotlight. Her characters included Candy Sweeney of "[[Recurring Saturday Night Live characters and sketches introduced 1986–1987#The Sweeney Sisters|The Sweeney Sisters]]". She performed notable impressions of [[Bette Davis]], [[Ann-Margret]], [[Betty Ford]], [[Nancy Reagan]], [[Sinéad O'Connor]], [[Jodie Foster]], [[Drew Barrymore]], [[Tammy Faye Messner|Tammy Faye Bakker]], [[Kathie Lee Gifford]], [[Kitty Dukakis]], [[Diane Sawyer]] and [[Hillary Clinton]].

Tiring of the stress of performing on a live show, Hooks left ''SNL'' in 1991 after being asked by [[Linda Bloodworth-Thomason]] to replace [[Jean Smart]] on the [[CBS]] sitcom ''[[Designing Women]]''. Hooks played the role of Carlene Dobber for the final two seasons of the show. She continued to make occasional appearances on ''SNL'' through 1994, usually playing [[Hillary Clinton]]. According to a 2014 Grantland article about her career and death, Hooks' combination of anxiety about acting and generally laidback approach to seeking out work led to her often turning down both prestigious auditions and lucrative acting roles; [[Tina Fey]] commented after her death that she was angry that Hooks didn't have a more successful career (Fey compared Hooks to [[Rob Schneider]] in noting Hooks was a bigger star than him on SNL and should have at least had his level of success) but another friend stated that Hooks didn't have doors slammed in her face and often made no efforts to seek out work. She appeared in several movies, starred as Dixie Glick in the series ''[[Jiminy Glick|Primetime Glick]]'', and the movie ''[[Jiminy Glick in Lalawood]]''. She had a recurring role as the trashy Vicki Dubcek on ''3rd Rock from the Sun'', which earned Hooks an Emmy Award nomination. Hooks guest-starred on two [[Matt Groening]]-produced cartoons for the FOX Network: six episodes of ''The Simpsons'' between 1997 and 2002, as Apu's wife Manjula (although [[Tress MacNeille]] sometimes substituted for her, and eventually replaced Hooks),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-29566428|title=US comedian Jan Hooks dies aged 57|publisher=BBC News|date=October 10, 2014|accessdate=October 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in ''[[Futurama]]'' (in the episode "[[Bendless Love]]" as the voice of a female robot named Angleyne).&lt;ref name="imdb"/&gt; She appeared in ''[[Pee-wee's Big Adventure]]'' as a know-it-all tour guide at the [[Alamo Mission in San Antonio|Alamo]] and made a [[cameo appearance]] in the 1992 movie ''[[Batman Returns]]'' as Jen, the [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]]'s image consultant during his campaign to become Mayor of [[Gotham City]]. She made two appearances on ''[[30 Rock]]'' in 2010 playing Jenna Maroney's mother, Verna, which ultimately were the last live-action spots she ever did. She guest starred in a 2013 episode of ''[[The Cleveland Show]]'' called "Mr. and Mrs. Brown", which was her final acting job.&lt;ref name="imdb"&gt;{{IMDb name|0393660}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Hooks died on October 9, 2014, at her home in [[Woodstock, New York]], at the age of 57&lt;ref name="liteseyfhobit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nytobit"/&gt; from throat cancer.&lt;ref name="Grantland"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://grantland.com/features/jan-hooks-saturday-night-live-phil-hartman-kevin-nealon-lorne-michaels-pee-wees-big-adventure/|title=The Laughs, Pathos, and Overwhelming Talent of Jan Hooks|newspaper=Grantland|first=Mike|last=Thomas|date=October 20, 2015|accessdate=January 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her remains were interred in Northview Cemetery in [[Cedartown, Georgia]].&lt;ref name="nwga"/&gt;

''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' aired a tribute for Hooks in the third episode of its 40th season on October 11, 2014, reairing a skit she had filmed in 1988 with [[Phil Hartman]].&lt;ref name=lovedream&gt;[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/jan-hooks-phil-hartman-saturday-740167 "'SNL' Remembers Jan Hooks With Emotional Tribute"]. ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', October 11, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The clip, "Love Is a Dream", was the same one that had concluded the show's special tribute episode to Hartman after his death in 1998. Guest host [[Bill Hader]] and [[Kristen Wiig]] introduced the tribute.&lt;ref name=lovedream/&gt; Earlier in the evening, NBC reaired a 1990 episode, hosted by [[Alec Baldwin]], which featured two of Hooks's most famous comedic sketches: "Brenda the Waitress", and one in which she played [[Greta Garbo]].&lt;ref name="liteseyfhobit"/&gt;

The ''[[The Simpsons|Simpsons]]'' episode "[[Super Franchise Me]]" memorialized her on October 12, 2014, with her longtime character [[Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon]] honored during the credits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://tv.avclub.com/the-simpsons-super-franchise-me-1798181871|title=The Simpsons: “Super Franchise Me”|last=Perkins|first=Dennis|work=TV Club|access-date=2018-05-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
