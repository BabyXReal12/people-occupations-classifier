'''Oliver Norvell "Babe" Hardy''' (born '''Norvell Hardy'''; January 18, 1892 – August 7, 1957) was an American [[Comedian|comic]] actor and one half of [[Laurel and Hardy]], the [[double act]] that began in the era of [[silent films]] and lasted 25 years, from 1927 to 1951. He appeared with his comedy partner [[Stan Laurel]] in 107 short films, feature films, and cameo roles.&lt;ref&gt;Rawlngs, Nate. [http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2005073_2005072_2005121,00.html "Top 10 Across-the-Pond Duos"], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', 20 July 2010. Retrieved: 18 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; He was credited with his first film, ''Outwitting Dad'', in 1914. In some of his early works, he was billed as "Babe Hardy", using his nickname.

==Early life and education==
Oliver Hardy was born Norvell Hardy in [[Harlem, Georgia]].&lt;ref&gt;Vincent Canby, "[https://www.nytimes.com/1990/06/16/movies/critics-notebook-laurel-with-and-without-hardy.html Critics Notebook; Laurel With and Without Hardy]", ''[[The New York Times]]'', 1990. Retrieved 8 August 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; His father Oliver &lt;!---a descendant of Sir Thomas Hardy, Flag Captain to Horatio Nelson,---needs a ref----&gt; was a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] veteran who had been wounded at the [[Battle of Antietam]] on September 17, 1862. After his demobilization as a recruiting officer for Company K, 16th Georgia Regiment, the elder Oliver Hardy assisted his father in running the vestiges of the family cotton [[plantations in the American South|plantation]]. He bought a share in a retail business and was elected full-time Tax Collector for [[Columbia County, Georgia]]. Norvell's mother Emily Norvell was the daughter of Thomas Benjamin Norvell and Mary Freeman, descended from [[Captain Hugh Norvell]] of [[Williamsburg, Virginia]], who had arrived in Virginia before 1635. Hardy and Norvell had married March 12, 1890; it was the second marriage for the widow Emily, and the third for Oliver. He was of paternal [[English Americans|English]] descent and maternal [[Scottish Americans|Scottish]] descent.

The family moved to [[Madison, Georgia|Madison]], Georgia in 1891, before Norvell's birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilson III|first1=Robert J.|title=Oliver Hardy in Georgia, 1903-1913|journal=Georgia Historical Quarterly|date=2003|volume=87|issue=3/4|pages=359-388|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=12115130&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site|accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emily Hardy owned a house in Harlem, which was either empty or rented out to tenant farmers. Norvell was likely born in Harlem, though some sources say that his birth occurred in [[Covington, Georgia|Covington]], his mother's hometown. His father died less than a year after his birth. Hardy was the youngest of five children. His older brother Sam Hardy died in a drowning accident in the [[Oconee River]]. Hardy pulled his brother from the river but was unable to resuscitate him.&lt;ref&gt;"This is Your Life", Episode December 1, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a child, Hardy was sometimes difficult. He was sent to [[Georgia Military College]] in [[Milledgeville, Georgia|Milledgeville]] as a youngster. He was sent to [[Young Harris College]] in north Georgia in the 1905-1906 school year fall semester (September–January) when he was 13. He was in the junior high component of that institution of the time (the equivalent of high school today).

Hardy had little interest in formal education, although he acquired an early interest in [[music]] and [[theater]], possibly from his mother's tenants. He joined a theatrical group and later ran away from a boarding school near [[Atlanta]] to sing with the group. His mother recognized his talent for singing and sent him to Atlanta to study music and voice with singing teacher [[Adolf Dahm-Petersen]]. Hardy skipped some of his lessons to sing in the Alcazar Theater, a cinema, for [[US$]]3.50 a week. He subsequently decided to go back to Milledgeville.

Sometime prior to 1910, Hardy began styling himself "Oliver Norvell Hardy", adding the first name "Oliver" as a tribute to his father. He appeared as "Oliver N. Hardy" in the 1910 U.S. census,{{#tag:ref|He was recorded as "Oliver M. Hardy" (not "N"), an "electrician" at an "electric theater". He was mistakenly listed as the "son" of Roy J. Baisden in his census listing.|group=N}} and he used "Oliver" as his first name in all subsequent legal records, marriage announcements, etc.

Hardy was initiated into [[Freemasonry]] at Solomon Lodge No. 20 in [[Jacksonville, Florida]]. His membership is mentioned in the TV interview on an episode of ''[[This Is Your Life]]'' in 1954. Along with [[Stan Laurel|Laurel]], Hardy was inducted into the [[Grand Order of Water Rats]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gowr.co.uk/roll-of-honour/|title=Roll of Honour|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Hardy's mother wanted him to attend the [[University of Georgia]] in the fall of 1912 to study law, but there is no evidence that he did.

==Career==

===Early career===
[[File:A Day at School.jpg|thumb|upright|Advertisement with Hardy for ''[[A Day at School]]'' (1916), part of the Plump &amp; Runt series]]

In 1910, when a movie theater opened in Hardy's hometown of Milledgeville, he became the [[projectionist]], ticket taker, [[janitor]], and [[Management|manager]]. He soon became obsessed with the new motion picture industry and was convinced that he could do a better job than the actors he saw. A friend suggested that he move to [[Jacksonville, Florida]], where some films were being made. In 1913, Hardy did just that, working in Jacksonville as a [[cabaret]] and [[vaudeville]] singer at night, and at the [[Lubin Manufacturing Company]] during the day. It was at this time that he met Madelyn Saloshin, a [[pianist]], whom he married on November 17, 1913, in [[Macon, Georgia]].

The next year he made his first movie, ''[[Outwitting Dad]]'' (1914), for the Lubin studio. He was billed as O. N. Hardy. In his personal life, he was known as "Babe" Hardy, a [[nickname]] that he was given by an [[Italian people|Italian]] [[barber]], who would apply [[talcum powder]] to Oliver's cheeks and say, "nice-a-bab-y." In many of his later films at Lubin, he was billed as "Babe Hardy." Hardy was a big man at 6'1" tall and weighing up to 300 pounds. His size placed limitations on the roles he could play. He was most often cast as "the heavy" or the villain. He also frequently had roles in comedy shorts, his size complementing the character.

By 1915, Hardy had made 50 [[short film|short]] one-[[reel]]er films at Lubin. He later moved to New York and made films for the [[Pathé]], Casino and [[Edison Studios]]. After returning to Jacksonville, he made films for the [[Vim Comedy Company]]. That studio closed after Hardy discovered the owners were stealing from the payroll.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dlis.dos.state.fl.us/barm/rediscovery/default.asp?IDCFile=/fsa/DETAILSS.IDC,SPECIFIC=483262,DATABASE=SERIES "Creator: Bletcher, Billy, 1894-1979, Title, Dates: Billy Bletcher's Vim Southern Studio motion picture photographs, 1915-1917."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726073759/http://dlis.dos.state.fl.us/barm/rediscovery/default.asp?IDCFile=%2Ffsa%2FDETAILSS.IDC%2CSPECIFIC%3D483262%2CDATABASE%3DSERIES |date=2011-07-26 }} ''State Archives of Florida Online Catalog.'' Retrieved: October 12, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; He worked for the King Bee studio, which bought Vim. He worked with [[Billy Ruge|Bill Ruge]], [[Billy West (silent film actor)|Billy West]] (a [[Charlie Chaplin]] imitator), and comedic actress Ethel Burton Palmer during this time. (Hardy continued playing the "heavy" for West well into the early 1920s, often imitating [[Eric Campbell (actor)|Eric Campbell]] to West's Chaplin.)

[[File:Laurel and Hardy in Lucky Dog.jpg|thumb|left|With Stan Laurel in ''[[The Lucky Dog (1921 film)|The Lucky Dog]]'' (1921), long before they became a team.]]

In 1917 Hardy moved to Los Angeles, working freelance for several Hollywood studios. Between 1918 and 1923, Hardy made more than 40 films for [[Vitagraph]], mostly playing the "heavy" for [[Larry Semon]]. In 1919, he separated from his wife, ending with a provisional divorce in November 1920, which was finalized on November 17, 1921. On November 24, 1921, Hardy married again, to actress Myrtle Reeves. This marriage was also unhappy. Reeves was said to have become an [[alcoholic]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.meandmypal.be/EN/oliver-hardy.html] "Sons of the Desert: Oliver Hardy Biography" Retrieved: July 11, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stanlaurelandoliverhardy.com/olly.htm] "Oliver Hardy" Retrieved: July 11, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1921, he appeared in the movie ''[[The Lucky Dog (1921 film)|The Lucky Dog]]'', produced by [[Broncho Billy Anderson|G.M. ("Broncho Billy") Anderson]] and starring a young British [[comedian]] named [[Stan Laurel]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://imdb.com/title/tt0013341/ "The Lucky Dog (1921)."] ''IMDb.com''. Retrieved: March 20, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Oliver Hardy played the part of a [[robber]], trying to stick up Stan's [[Fictional character|character]]. They did not work together again for several years.  In 1924, Hardy began working at [[Hal Roach Studios]] with the ''[[Our Gang]]'' films and [[Charley Chase]]. In 1925, he starred as the Tin Man in the ''[[Wizard of Oz (1925 film)|Wizard of Oz]]''. Also that year he was in the film ''Yes, Yes, Nanette!'', starring [[Jimmy Finlayson]] and directed by Stan Laurel. (In later years Finlayson frequently was a supporting actor in the Laurel and Hardy film series.)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Louvish|2001|page=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also continued playing supporting roles in films featuring [[Clyde Cooke]] and Bobby Ray.

In 1926, Hardy was scheduled to appear in ''Get 'Em Young.'' He was unexpectedly hospitalized after being burned by a hot leg of lamb. Laurel, who had been working as a gag man and director at Roach Studios, was recruited to fill in.&lt;ref&gt;Evanier, Mark.

Retrieved: March 20, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Laurel continued to act and, later that year, appeared in the same movie as Hardy, ''[[45 Minutes from Hollywood]]'', although they did not share any scenes together.

[[File:Another fine mess 1930 poster.jpg|thumb|upright|Movie poster of ''[[Another Fine Mess (1930 film)|Another Fine Mess]]'' (1930)]]

In 1927, Laurel and Hardy began sharing screen time together in ''[[Slipping Wives]]'', ''[[Duck Soup (1927 film)|Duck Soup]]'' (no relation to the 1933 [[Marx Brothers]]' [[Duck Soup (1933 film)|film of the same name]]) and ''[[With Love and Hisses]]''. Roach Studios' supervising director [[Leo McCarey]], realizing the audience reaction to the two, began intentionally teaming them together. This led to the start of a Laurel and Hardy series later that year.

They began producing a huge body of short movies, including ''[[The Battle of the Century]]'' (1927) (with one of the largest pie fights ever filmed), ''[[Should Married Men Go Home?]]'' (1928), ''[[Two Tars]]'' (1928), ''[[Unaccustomed As We Are]]'' (1929, marking their transition to [[talking pictures]]) ''[[Berth Marks]]'' (1929), ''[[Blotto (1930 film)|Blotto]]'' (1930), ''[[Brats]]'' (1930) (with Stan and Ollie portraying themselves, as well as their own "sons", using oversized furniture sets for the "young" Laurel and Hardy); ''[[Another Fine Mess (1930 film)|Another Fine Mess]]'' (1930), ''[[Be Big!]]'' (1931), and many others.

In 1929, they appeared in their first feature, in one of the revue sequences of ''[[Hollywood Revue of 1929]],'' and the following year they appeared as the comic relief in a lavish all-color (in [[Technicolor]]) musical feature entitled ''[[The Rogue Song]]''. This film marked their first appearance in color, yet only a few fragments of this film survive.   In 1931, they starred in their first full-length movie, ''[[Pardon Us]];'' they continued to make features and shorts until 1935. ''[[The Music Box (1932 film)|The Music Box]]'', a 1932 three-reeler, won an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for best short film — their only effort to receive such an award.

[[File:The Flying Deuces (1939) 1.jpg|thumb|left|Laurel and Hardy in ''[[The Flying Deuces]]'' (1939)]]

In 1937, Hardy and Myrtle Reeves divorced. In 1939, while waiting for a contractual issue between Laurel and Hal Roach to be resolved, Hardy made ''[[Zenobia (film)|Zenobia]]'' with [[Harry Langdon]]. Eventually, however, new contracts were agreed upon and the team was loaned out to producer [[Boris Morros]] at General Service Studios to make ''[[The Flying Deuces]]'' (1939). While on the lot, Hardy fell in love with Virginia Lucille Jones, a script girl, whom he married the next year. They enjoyed a happy marriage until his death.

In 1939, Laurel and Hardy made ''[[A Chump at Oxford]]'' (1940) (which features a moment of role reversal, with Oliver becoming a subordinate to a temporarily concussed Stan) and ''[[Saps at Sea]]'' (1940) before leaving Roach Studios. They began performing for the [[USO]], supporting the Allied troops during [[World War II]]. They teamed up to make films for [[20th Century Fox]] and later [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. Although they made more money at the bigger studios, they had very little artistic control; critics say that these films lack the very qualities that had made Laurel and Hardy worldwide names. Their last Fox feature was ''[[The Bullfighters]]'' (1945), after which they declined to extend their contract with the studio.

In 1947, Laurel and Hardy went on a six-week tour of the United Kingdom. Initially unsure of how they would be received, they were mobbed wherever they went. The tour was lengthened to include engagements in Scandinavia, Belgium, France, as well as a [[Royal Command Performance]] for [[George VI of the United Kingdom|King George VI]] and [[Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon|Queen Elizabeth]]. Biographer John McCabe said they continued to make live appearances in the United Kingdom and France for the next several years, until 1954, often using new sketches and material that Laurel had written for them.

[[File:The Fighting Kentuckian Oliver Hardy.jpg|thumb|right|Oliver Hardy in ''[[The Fighting Kentuckian]]'' (1949)]]

In 1949, Hardy's friend, [[John Wayne]], asked him to play a supporting role in ''[[The Fighting Kentuckian]]''. Hardy had previously worked with Wayne and [[John Ford]] in a charity production of the play ''[[What Price Glory? (play)|What Price Glory?]]'' while Laurel began treatment for his diabetes a few years previously. Initially hesitant, Hardy accepted the role at the insistence of his comedy partner. [[Frank Capra]] later invited Hardy to play a [[cameo role]] in ''[[Riding High (1950 film)|Riding High]]'' with [[Bing Crosby]] in 1950.

During 1950–51, Laurel and Hardy made their final film. ''[[Atoll K]]'' (also known as ''Utopia'') was a simple concept; Laurel inherits an island, and the boys set out to sea, where they encounter a storm and discover a brand new island, rich in [[uranium]], making them powerful and wealthy. However, the film was produced by a consortium of European interests, with an international cast and crew that could not speak to each other.&lt;ref name=NA&gt;Aping, Norbert. ''The Final Film of Laurel and Hardy''. Jefferson, North Carolina: McFarland, 2008. {{ISBN|978-0-7864-3302-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the [[Screenplay|script]] needed to be rewritten by Laurel to make it fit the comedy team's style, and both suffered serious physical illness during the filming.

Oliver Hardy, along with Stan Laurel, made two live television appearances:  In 1953, on a live BBC television broadcast of the popular show "Face the Music" with host Henry Hall and in December 1954, on NBC's ''[[This Is Your Life]]''.  They also appeared in a filmed insert for the BBC-TV show ''This Is Music Hall'' in 1955, their final public appearance together.

Partly due to the overwhelmingly positive response to the ''[[This Is Your Life]]'' telecast, the pair contracted with Hal Roach, Jr., to produce a series of TV shows based on the [[Mother Goose]] fables in 1955.  According to biographer John McCabe, they were to be filmed in color for [[NBC]], but the series was postponed when Laurel suffered a [[stroke]] and required a lengthy convalescence.  Later that year while Laurel was recovering, Hardy had a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] and stroke from which he never physically recovered.

In May 1954, Hardy suffered a mild heart attack. During 1956, he began looking after his health for the first time in his life. He lost more than 150 pounds in a few months, which completely changed his appearance. Letters written by Laurel refer to Hardy having terminal cancer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lettersfromstan.com/stan_1957-08.html "Rubber Stamp- 25406-1/2 Malibu Rd., Malibu, CA - Typewritten."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719093433/http://www.lettersfromstan.com/stan_1957-08.html |date=2011-07-19 }} ''Letters from Stan.''

Hardy suffered a major stroke on September 14, 1956, which left him confined to bed and unable to speak for several months. He remained at home, in the care of his beloved Lucille. He suffered two more strokes in early August 1957 and slipped into a [[coma]] from which he never recovered. Hardy died from [[cerebral thrombosis]] on August 7, 1957, at the age of 65.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1957/08/08/archives/oliver-hardy-of-film-team-dies-costar-of-200-slapstick-movies.html "Oliver Hardy of Film Team Dies.
