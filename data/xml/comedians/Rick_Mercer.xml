'''Richard Vincent "Rick" Mercer''' {{post-nominals|country=CAN|OC}} (born October 17, 1969) is a Canadian [[comedian]], television personality, [[Political satire|political satirist]] and [[author]]. He is best known for his work on the [[CBC Television]] comedy shows ''[[This Hour Has 22 Minutes]]'' and ''[[Rick Mercer Report]]''. He is the author of three books, based on content from the television shows.

Mercer has received more than 25 [[Gemini Awards]] for his work on television.

==Career==

===Early work===
Mercer first came to national attention in 1990, when he created and presented his one-man stage show ''Show Me the Button, I'll Push It, or [[Charles Burchill Lynch|Charles Lynch]] Must Die'' at the [[National Arts Centre|National Arts Centre's Atelier]] in [[Ottawa]].&lt;ref name=canenc&gt;[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/rick-mercer/ Rick Mercer] at [[The Canadian Encyclopedia]].&lt;/ref&gt; A pointed, satirical political commentary on Canadian life after [[Meech Lake Accord|Meech Lake]], ''Show Me the Button'' made Mercer a national star as he toured the show across Canada.&lt;ref name=canenc /&gt; In 1992, he created and performed his second stage show, ''I've Killed Before, I'll Kill Again'' at the [[National Arts Centre|National Arts Centre's Studio Theatre]], which also became a popular touring show.&lt;ref name=canenc /&gt;

===''This Hour has 22 Minutes''===
In 1992 he began to work with former ''[[CODCO]]'' members [[Cathy Jones]], [[Mary Walsh (actress)|Mary Walsh]] and with fellow Newfoundlander [[Greg Thomey]], to create a new television series for [[CBC Television]] which became ''[[This Hour Has 22 Minutes]]''. In the first eight seasons of ''22 Minutes'', Mercer provided some of the show's signature moments, including an Internet petition (on the '' 22 Minutes'' website) to force [[Canadian Alliance]] leader [[Stockwell Day]] to [[Doris Day|change his first name to Doris]].

Mercer's tightly scripted and performed two-minute "rants", in which he would speak directly to the camera about a current political issue, shot in a style similar to those [[Denis Leary]] used in [[MTV]] commercials, quickly became the show's signature segment. In 1998, he published a book, ''Streeters'', which compiled many of his most famous ''22 Minutes'' rants. It quickly became a national bestseller. In 2007 he published his second book, ''Rick Mercer Report: The Book''.

In November 2010, Mercer contributed a rant he had previously recorded in 2007 on the subject of teen [[bullying]] in high schools to [[Dan Savage]]'s [[It Gets Better Project]].&lt;ref name="It gets better"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/rick-mercer-joins-it-gets-better-campaign-1.967052|title=Rick Mercer joins It Gets Better campaign|publisher=CBC News|date=November 2, 2010|accessdate=2015-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Talking to Americans''====
{{main|Talking to Americans}}
One of Mercer's trademark comedy routines on ''22 Minutes'' was ''[[Talking to Americans]]'', in which he would travel to a major American city or institution and conduct on-the-street interviews with average Americans regarding Canadian politics, the weather, etc., often with hilarious results as the subject's ignorance about Canada was illustrated. One famous example saw Mercer asking Americans' opinion on whether Canada should change its "20 Hour Clock" to the 24-hour one used by the United States.  He received approval from citizens and from the Governor of Iowa, [[Tom Vilsack]]. On another occasion he got the support of [[Arkansas]] Governor [[Mike Huckabee]] in calling on Canadians to save the "National Igloo".

Mercer made international headlines in 2000 when he pulled a ''Talking to Americans'' stunt on then-presidential candidate [[George W. Bush]]. He successfully got Bush to answer questions about non-existent Canadian Prime Minister "Jean [[Poutine]]". Bush was not amused at the time, and thereafter refused to accept interviews from the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} However, he did make a joking reference to this incident during his visit to Canada in 2004. In the same US election campaign, Mercer asked Democratic candidate [[Al Gore]] to promise to visit the "Canadian capital city" of [[Toronto]] after his election. Gore did not question Mercer's incorrect identification of the capital of Canada.

In 2001, Mercer co-produced a CBC special based on ''Talking to Americans'', which attracted 2.7&amp;nbsp;million Canadian viewers—the highest-rated television special in Canadian history. Later, the respected [[ABC News]] program ''[[Nightline (US news program)|Nightline]]'' would devote a show to it.  This was his last major project related to ''22 Minutes''—at the end of the 2000–2001 season, he announced his departure from that show.  It was rumoured that he had decided to leave because of friction between Mercer and co-star [[Mary Walsh (actress)|Mary Walsh]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}, although other reasons include focusing on his other television show, ''[[Made in Canada]]''. ''Talking to Americans'' was nominated for a [[Gemini Award]], but following the [[9/11 attacks]], Mercer declined the nomination.

===''Made in Canada''===
{{main|Made in Canada}}
Mercer co-created the series ''[[Made in Canada]]'', which ran for five seasons on [[CBC Television]] from 1998–2003. The show was a fast-paced [[situation comedy]] which [[self-reference|self-referentially]] satirized the Canadian TV production industry, often drawing from details of its own production companies and including thinly veiled parodies of contemporary programs. It was syndicated abroad as ''The Industry'' and won several [[Gemini Award]]s (which were themselves satirized in subsequent episodes).

===''The Rick Mercer Report''===
{{main|Rick Mercer Report}}
In 2003, ''[[Made in Canada]]'' ended its run as well, and Mercer began to work on a new CBC series, ''[[Rick Mercer Report|Rick Mercer's Monday Report]]''. Similar in format to ''22 Minutes'' and ''[[The Daily Show with Jon Stewart]]'', the show debuted in January 2004. Also in 2003, Mercer went to [[Afghanistan]] to visit the Canadian troops stationed there (See: [[Operation Athena]]), resulting in the television special ''[[Christmas in Kabul]]''.

Despite reports of a long-standing feud Mercer invited Walsh to appear on ''Monday Report'' as a special guest to promote her own series ''[[Hatching, Matching and Dispatching]]''.

At the end of its second season, ''Monday Report'' was the highest rated arts and entertainment show on the CBC. Mercer has had a who's who from the world of Canadian entertainment and politics appear as guests on his show. Ex-Prime Minister [[Paul Martin]] gave him a private tour of [[24 Sussex Drive]] and former [[New Democratic Party of Canada|New Democratic Party]] leader [[Ed Broadbent]] made snow angels with Mercer on [[Parliament Hill]]. Other prominent guests were [[New Democratic Party of Canada|NDP]] leader [[Jack Layton]] (who was Mercer's own MP); [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative Party]] leader [[Stephen Harper]] (former Prime Minister); [[Green Party of Canada|Green Party]] leader [[Elizabeth May]]; then-Conservative MP [[Belinda Stronach]]; Conservative MP [[Peter MacKay]]; former Newfoundland and Labrador Premier [[Danny Williams (politician)|Danny Williams]]; Olympic gold medallist [[Kyle Shewfelt]]; author [[Pierre Berton]]; recording artists [[Jann Arden]], [[Bif Naked]], [[Rush (band)|Rush]] [[bassist]] [[Geddy Lee]] and [[drummer]] and [[lyricist]] [[Neil Peart]], and [[Sarah McLachlan]]; publishing mogul [[Conrad Black]]; and former [[Prime Minister]] [[Jean Chrétien]]. When Mercer hosted a relief [[benefit concert]] for the victims of the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake|2004 Indian Ocean tsunami]] at the [[Pengrowth Saddledome]] in [[Calgary, Alberta|Calgary]], musical guests [[Barenaked Ladies]] appeared in a segment Mercer shot backstage completely naked.

In 2005, the CBC moved ''Monday Report'' to Tuesday nights, which caused the show's name to be changed to ''The Rick Mercer Report''. On his blog, Mercer wrote of the time slot shift that "we ended the season as the highest rated comedy show on the network. Clearly some drastic changes were needed."

In 2017, it was announced that the Rick Mercer Report will air for its 15th and final season which concluded on April 10, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mediaincanada.com/2018/05/01/mercers-final-rant-gets-big-ratings/|title=Mercer’s final rant gets big ratings|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other film and television work===
Mercer has hosted ''[[It Seems Like Yesterday]]'', which examines pop-culture from the 1950s to the 1980s. He has appeared in a few films, including ''[[Secret Nation]]'', ''Understanding Bliss'' and ''[[Bon Cop, Bad Cop]]''.

An independent documentary ''Jesus Meets The Gay Man'' produced by DDP Studios Inc in Toronto named Rick as part of its stars list &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jesusmeetsthegayman.com/ Jesus Meets The Gay Man website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books==

A book by Mercer, ''Rick Mercer Report: The Book'', based on his television program, was published on September 25, 2007, by Doubleday Canada.  This was Mercer's first book since his bestselling ''Streeters'' of 1998, and contained a collection of the best of Mercer's "rants" from the first four seasons of ''Rick Mercer Report'', together with choice moments from interviews for the program and other writings by Mercer. On CBC Radio's ''Sounds Like Canada'' on September 21, [[Shelagh Rogers]] said of the book that "it's the most fun I've had in bed in a long time."  The book entered the ''Globe and Mail'' books chart on October 6 at number three.  It was number one in the ''Globe'' bestseller list in the week before Christmas 2007, and reprinted eight times.

An expanded and updated paperback version of ''Rick Mercer Report: The Book'', called ''Rick Mercer Report: The Paperback Book'', was published by Anchor Canada on September 16, 2008 and immediately entered the top ten of the ''Globe and Mail'' bestseller list.  It has been reprinted several times.

Rick Mercer's next book, ''A Nation Worth Ranting About'', was published by Doubleday Canada on September 18, 2012, and was another instant bestseller.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Mercer|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
Mercer has received more than 25 [[Gemini Awards]] for his television work. He has also been a winner of the prestigious [[Peter Ustinov|Sir Peter Ustinov Comedy Award]], presented to him at the 2003 [[Banff Television Festival]]. In 1993, Newfoundland premier [[Clyde Wells]] honoured Mercer with the Newfoundland Arts Council's Artist of the Year award. In 2004, Mercer was presented with the [[National Arts Centre]] Award, a companion award of the [[Governor General's Performing Arts Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rick Mercer biography|url=http://ggpaa.ca/award-recipients/2004/mercer-rick.aspx|publisher=Governor General's Performing Arts Awards Foundation|accessdate=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He donated his $15,000 cash prize to the LSPU hall, the theatre in Newfoundland where Mercer performed his early work.
