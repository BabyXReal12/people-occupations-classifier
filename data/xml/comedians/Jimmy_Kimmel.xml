'''James Christian Kimmel''' (born November 13, 1967)&lt;ref name=tvgbio /&gt; is an American television host, comedian, writer, and producer. He is the host and executive producer of ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'', a [[late-night talk show]] that premiered on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in 2003. Kimmel hosted the [[Primetime Emmy Awards]] in [[64th Primetime Emmy Awards|2012]] and [[68th Primetime Emmy Awards|2016]], and the [[Academy Awards]] in [[89th Academy Awards|2017]] and [[90th Academy Awards|2018]].

Before hosting ''Jimmy Kimmel Live!'', he was best known as the co-host of [[Comedy Central|Comedy Central's]] ''[[The Man Show]]'' and ''[[Win Ben Stein's Money]]''. Kimmel has also produced such shows as ''[[Crank Yankers]]'', ''[[Sports Show with Norm Macdonald]]'', and ''[[The Andy Milonakis Show]]''.

== Early life and family ==
Kimmel was born in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and grew up in the neighborhood of [[Mill Basin, Brooklyn|Mill Basin]]&lt;ref name="rock interview"&gt;{{cite episode |title = Interview with Chris Rock |series = Jimmy Kimmel Live |network=ABC |airdate=June 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the eldest of three children of Joan (née Iacono), a homemaker, and James John Kimmel, who worked at [[American Express]] and was an [[IBM]] executive.&lt;ref name=people&gt;{{cite web |last = Lipton |first = Michael A. |url = http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20139546,00.html |title = Kimmel Vision – Jimmy Kimmel Live, Jimmy Kimmel |work = People |date = March 17, 2003 |accessdate = July 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/21/arts/television/21rhod.html |work = The New York Times |title = Distilling the Fun From Dysfunctional |first = Joe |last = Rhodes |date = October 21, 2007 |accessdate = May 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title = Interview with Matthew Fox |series = Jimmy Kimmel Live |network = ABC |airdate = July 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His family's surname was "[[Kümmel (disambiguation)|Kümmel]]" ("[[caraway]]" in German) several generations back.&lt;ref name=fdnr1&gt;Stated on ''[[Finding Your Roots]]'', January 26, 2016, PBS&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3I5Y_lO4M8Q |title = Catherine Bell on Jimmy Kimmel |publisher = YouTube |date = September 9, 2007 |accessdate = July 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.sitiincontri.it |title = extraconiugali}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|q41tYW5Gfds|Ancestry.com on ''Jimmy Kimmel Live''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The family moved to [[Las Vegas, Nevada]], when he was nine years old.&lt;ref name=people /&gt; He graduated from [[Ed W. Clark High School]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1 = Santiago |first1 = Brianna |title = 13 celebrities you didn’t know graduated from L.V. high schools |url = http://lasvegassun.com/news/2015/jun/19/12-celebrities-you-didnt-know-graduated-las-vegas-/ |accessdate = June 19, 2015 |newspaper = [[Las Vegas Sun]] |date = June 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then attended [[University of Nevada, Las Vegas]] (for one year) and [[Arizona State University]] (for two years).

Kimmel's uncle, [[Frank Potenza]] ("Uncle Frank"), appeared on ''Jimmy Kimmel Live!'' as a regular from 2003 until his death in 2011.&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{cite news |first = Bill |last = Carter |title = Frank Potenza, Foil for Kimmel, Is Dead at 77 |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/26/arts/television/frank-potenza-foil-for-nephew-jimmy-kimmel-dies-at-77.html |work = New York Times |date = August 26, 2011 |accessdate = September 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His cousin, [[Sal Iacono]], performed Kimmel's former co-hosting duties during the last season of ''Win Ben Stein's Money'' and then became a writer and sketch performer on ''Jimmy Kimmel Live!''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=10th Annual Jimmy Kimmel Live Belly Flop Competition|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMEEdFz0d7Q|accessdate=27 July 2016|language=English|format=YouTube Video|date=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His Aunt Chippy (Concetta Potenza) is also a featured part of the show.

== Career ==

=== Radio career ===

Kimmel began working in the radio industry while in high school, hosting a Sunday night interview show on [[UNLV]]'s college station, [[KUNV]].{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} While attending [[Arizona State University]], he became a popular caller to the [[KZZP]]-FM afternoon show hosted by radio personalities Mike Elliott and [[Kent Voss]] in [[Phoenix, Arizona]]. In 1989, Kimmel landed his first paying job alongside Voss as morning drive co-host of ''The Me and Him Show'' at [[KZOK-FM]] in Seattle, Washington. {{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

Ten months later, Kimmel and Voss were fired by KZOK and were fired again a year later at [[WRBQ-FM]] in [[Tampa, Florida]]. Kimmel went on to host his own show at [[KKUU|KCMJ]] in [[Palm Springs, California]], where he persuaded a young [[Carson Daly]] to drop out of college and become his intern. {{citation needed|date=May 2014}} After a morning stint at [[KRQQ]] in [[Tucson, Arizona]], Kimmel landed at [[KROQ-FM]] in Los Angeles. He spent five years as "Jimmy The Sports Guy" for the [[Kevin and Bean]] morning show. During this time he met and befriended a struggling comedian named [[Adam Carolla]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Carolla |first = Adam |title = In 50 Years We'll All Be Chicks |year = 2010 |publisher = Crown Archetype |isbn=0-307-71737-2}}&lt;!-- page(s)?? --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Comedy Central ===

Kimmel began his television career as the comedic counterpart to [[Ben Stein]] on the game show ''[[Win Ben Stein's Money]]'', which began airing on [[Comedy Central]] in 1997. His quick wit and "[[everyman]]" personality were counterpoints to Stein's monotonous vocal style and faux-[[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patrician]] demeanor. The combination earned the pair an [[Emmy]] award for Best Game Show Host.

In 1999, during his time with ''Win Ben Stein's Money'', Kimmel co-hosted (with [[Adam Carolla]]) and co-produced (with [[Daniel Kellison]]), Comedy Central's ''[[The Man Show]]''. Kimmel left ''Win Ben Stein's Money'' in 2001 and was replaced by comedian [[Nancy Pimental]], who was eventually replaced by Kimmel's cousin [[Sal Iacono]]. ''[[The Man Show]]'''s success allowed Kimmel, Carolla, and Kellison to create and produce, under the banner [[Jackhole Productions]], ''[[Crank Yankers]]'' for [[Comedy Central]] (on which Kimmel plays the characters "Elmer Higgins", "Terrence Catheter", "The Nudge", "[[Karl Malone]]" and himself) and later ''[[The Andy Milonakis Show]]'' for MTV2. Kimmel also produced and co-wrote the feature film ''[[Windy City Heat]]'', Festival Prize winner of the Comedia Award for Best Film at the 2004 [[Montreal Comedy Festival]].

=== ''Jimmy Kimmel Live!'' ===
[[File:Jimmy Kimmel in 2015.jpg|thumb|right|Kimmel during a ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'' video taping in March 2015]]
{{Main|Jimmy Kimmel Live!}}

In January 2003, Jimmy Kimmel permanently left ''The Man Show'' to host his own late-night talk show, ''Jimmy Kimmel Live!'', on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. In the April 2007 issue of Stuffmagazine.com, Kimmel was named the "biggest badass on TV". Kimmel said it was an honor but clearly a mistake.

Despite its name, the show hasn't actually aired live since 2004, when censors were unable to properly [[bleep censor]] a barrage of swearing from actor [[Thomas Jane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.vulture.com/2012/10/jimmy-kimmel-live-gets-new-time-slot.html |title = Jimmy Kimmel Takes On Brooklyn And Two New Rivals |last = Yuan |first = Jada |publisher = [[New York (magazine)|Vulture]] |date = October 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During an incident during the [[2004 NBA Finals]] in Detroit, Kimmel appeared on ABC's halftime show to make an on-air plug for his show. He suggested that if the [[Detroit Pistons]] defeated the [[Los Angeles Lakers]], "they're gonna burn the city of Detroit down … and it's not worth it." Officials with Detroit's ABC affiliate, [[WXYZ-TV]], immediately announced that that night's show would not air on the station. Hours later, ABC officials pulled that night's show from the entire network. Kimmel later apologized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first = Gary |last = Susman |title = The Ban Show |url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,650146,00.html |work = Entertainment Weekly |date = June 11, 2004 |accessdate = January 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kimmel usually ends his show with "My apologies to [[Matt Damon]], we ran out of time." When Matt Damon did actually appear on the show to be interviewed, he walked in and sat down only to be told just a few seconds later by Kimmel, "Unfortunately, we are totally out of time," followed by "my apologies to Matt Damon." Damon appeared angry but both performers have since indicated that their faux-feud is a joke.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Bethonie, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2017/02/27/the-long-hilarious-history-of-jimmy-kimmel-and-matt-damon-pretending-to-hate-each-other/ The long, hilarious history of Jimmy Kimmel and Matt Damon pretending to hate each other], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', 27 February 2017. Retrieved 28 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2008, Kimmel showed a mock music video with a panoply of stars called "[[I'm fucking matt damon|I'm Fucking Ben Affleck]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20180150,00.html |title = So Long, Sarah! Jimmy Kimmel Is, Well, 'Dating' Ben Affleck |first = Stephen M. |last = Silverman |work = [[People (magazine)|People]] |date = February 25, 2008 |accessdate = February 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; as "revenge" after his then-girlfriend [[Sarah Silverman]] and Damon recorded a similar video titled, "[[I'm Fucking Matt Damon]]". Silverman's video originally aired on ''Jimmy Kimmel Live!'' and became an "instant YouTube sensation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20175789,00.html |title = Behind Matt Damon's Raunchy Payback to Jimmy Kimmel |first = Julie |last = Jordan |work = [[People (magazine)|People]] |date = February 2, 2008 |accessdate = February 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kimmel's "revenge" video featured himself, [[Ben Affleck]], and a large lineup of stars, particularly in scenes spoofing the 1985 "[[We Are the World]]" video: [[Brad Pitt]], [[Don Cheadle]], [[Cameron Diaz]], [[Robin Williams]], [[Harrison Ford]], [[Dominic Monaghan]], [[Benji Madden]] and [[Joel Madden]] from [[Good Charlotte]], [[Lance Bass]], [[Macy Gray]], [[Josh Groban]], [[Huey Lewis]], [[Perry Farrell]], [[Christopher Mintz-Plasse]], [[Pete Wentz]], [[Meat Loaf]], [[Rebecca Romijn]], [[Christina Applegate]], [[Dom Joly]], [[Mike Shinoda]], [[Lauren Conrad]], and [[Joan Jett]], among others.

After this, Jimmy's sidekick, Guillermo, appeared in a spoof of ''[[The Bourne Ultimatum (film)|The Bourne Ultimatum]]'', which starred Damon. He was then chased down by Damon, who was cursing about Kimmel being behind all this. Guillermo also stopped Damon on the red carpet one time and before he could finish the interview he said, "Sorry, we are out of time." The most recent encounter was titled "The Handsome Men's Club" which featured Kimmel, along with the "Handsome Men", who were: [[Matthew McConaughey]], [[Rob Lowe]], [[Lenny Kravitz]], [[Patrick Dempsey]], [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], [[Keith Urban]], [[John Krasinski]], [[Ethan Hawke]], [[Josh Hartnett]], [[Tony Romo]], [[Ted Danson]], [[Taye Diggs]], [[Gilles Marini]], and [[Ben Affleck]], speaking about being handsome and all the jobs that come with it. At the end of the skit Kimmel has a door slammed in his face by none other than [[Matt Damon]], stating that they had run out of time and then Damon continues with a sinister laugh. [[Jennifer Garner]] also makes a surprise appearance. As a tradition, celebrities voted off ''[[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. TV series)|Dancing with the Stars]]'' appear on ''Jimmy Kimmel Live!'', causing Kimmel to describe himself as "the [[Cerberus|three-headed dog]] the stars must pass on their way to No-Dancing Hell".

In October 2013, a new segment of the show, "Kids Table", showcased five- and six-year-olds discussing the U.S. government shutdown and U.S. debts. When one of the children suggested "killing all the people in China", as a way of resolving the U.S. debt, Kimmel responded that that was "an interesting idea" and soon jokingly asked a follow up: “Should we allow the Chinese to live?”.&lt;ref name="ew"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://insidetv.ew.com/2013/10/28/jimmy-kimmel-live-china-joke-apology |title = ABC apologizes for child's China joke on ''Jimmy Kimmel Live'' |date = October 28, 2013 |work = Entertainment Weekly |accessdate = February 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident triggered discussions and protests on Internet, even from [[Mainland China]]. In an October 25 letter to a group called the [[80-20 Initiative]], which identifies itself as a pan-Asian-American political organization, ABC apologized for the segment, saying "We would never purposefully broadcast anything to upset the Chinese community, Asian community, anyone of Chinese descent or any community at large."&lt;ref name=ew /&gt;&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://entertainment.time.com/2013/10/28/kids-say-the-most-divisive-things-asian-americans-protest-jimmy-kimmel |title = Asian Americans Protest Jimmy Kimmel |last = Steinmetz |first = Katy |date = October 28, 2013 |work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate = February 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More than 100 people took to the streets in San Francisco on October 28 to protest the show and demand "a more elaborate apology" and that Kimmel to be fired.&lt;ref name=time /&gt; On that day's broadcast, Kimmel addressed the controversy personally, saying: "I thought it was obvious that I didn't agree with that statement, but apparently it wasn't … So I just wanted to say, I'm sorry, I apologize.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2013/10/29/abc-apologizes-for-kill-everyone-in-china-line-on-jimmy-kimmel-live |title = ABC Apologizes for "Kill Everyone in China" Line on Jimmy Kimmel Live |last = Little |first = Lyneka |date = October 29, 2013 |work = [[The Wall Street Journal]] |accessdate = February 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the apologies from ABC and Kimmel, protests continued. A [[White House petition]] was created to investigate this incident and reached the 100,000 signatures needed to require a response from the White House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/reliable-source/wp/2013/11/08/how-jimmy-kimmels-china-joke-became-an-issue-for-the-white-house |title = How Jimmy Kimmel's China joke became an issue for the White House |date = November 8, 2013 |work = The Washington Post |accessdate = February 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus]] denounced the incident and demanded a formal apology from ABC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://capac-chu.house.gov/press-release/capac-issues-letter-racially-insensitive-kids-table-segment-jimmy-kimmel-live |title = CAPAC Issues Letter on Racially Insensitive "Kids' Table" Segment on Jimmy Kimmel Live |date = October 29, 2013 |work = [[United States House of Representatives]] |accessdate = February 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other television work ===
[[File:JimmyKimmelHWOFSept2012.jpg|thumb|right|Kimmel in September 2012]]
In spring 1996, Kimmel appeared as "Jimmy the Fox Guy" in promos on the [[Fox Network]]. His other television work included being the on-air football prognosticator for ''[[Fox NFL Sunday]]'' for four years. He has had numerous appearances on other talk shows including, but not limited to, ''[[Live with Regis and Kelly]]'', ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'', ''[[The Ellen DeGeneres Show]]'', and the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]''.

He has appeared on ''[[Late Show with David Letterman|The Late Show]]'' five times, most recently in 2010. Kimmel served as roastmaster for the [[New York Friars' Club]] Roast of [[Hugh Hefner]] and [[Comedy Central Roast]]s of ''[[Pamela Anderson]]''. He has appeared on ABC's ''Dancing with the Stars''.

In August 2006, ABC announced that Jimmy Kimmel would be the host of their new game show ''[[Set for Life]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?id=20060822abc02 |title = Jimmy Kimmel Named Host For ABC's Newst Game Show, "Set For Life", From Endemol USA |publisher = Thefutoncritic.com |date = September 26, 2006 |accessdate = July 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show debuted on July 20, 2007. On April 6, 2007, Kimmel filled in for [[Larry King]] on ''[[Larry King Live]]''. That particular broadcast dealt with paparazzi. Kimmel reproached [[Emily Gould]], an editor from [[Gawker.com]], about the web site's alleged stalking of celebrities. On July 8, 2007, Kimmel managed the National League in the 2007 [[Taco Bell]] All-Star Legends and Celebrity Softball Game in San Francisco. He played in the game in 2004 and 2006 (in Houston and Pittsburgh, respectively). On July 11, 2007, Kimmel, along with basketball player [[LeBron James]], hosted the 2007 ''[[ESPY Awards]]''. The show aired on [[ESPN]] on July 15, 2007. Kimmel hosted the [[American Music Awards]] on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] five times, in 2003, 2004, 2006, 2007, and 2008.

Kimmel guest hosted ''[[Live with Regis and Kelly]]'' during the week of October 22–26, 2007, commuting every day between New York and Los Angeles.

Kimmel derided Leno in front of a live studio audience for taking back the 11:35&amp;nbsp;pm time slot from [[Conan O'Brien]], and repeatedly insulted Leno. He ended the segment with a plea that Leno "leave our shows alone," as Kimmel and O'Brien had "kids" while Leno only had "cars".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wwtdd.com/2010/01/jimmy-kimmel-annihilated-jay-leno |title = kimmel &gt; leno. again. |publisher = What Would Tyler Durden Do? |date = January 15, 2010 |accessdate = January 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influences ==
[[File:David Letterman at Perelman Institute crop.jpg|thumb|upright|[[David Letterman]] was Kimmel's biggest inspiration for getting into comedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29ELOsXSI0|title=YouTube|website=www.youtube.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Qy5Bln-VBE|title=LATE SHOW with David Letterman - November 1, 1999 - Jimmy Kimmel (PARTIAL SHOW)|first=|last=Daniel Poitras|date=March 23, 2017|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Kimmel's biggest influences in comedy are [[David Letterman]] and [[Howard Stern]]. Kimmel has described Letterman's work as, "His show was just so weird and different, I'd never seen anything like it. I didn't know anyone who had a sense of humor like that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Here's Jimmy Kimmel|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/heres-jimmy-kimmel-20130301?page=2|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|first=Jonah|last=Weiner|date=March 1, 2012|accessdate=February 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kimmel has often joked that the only reason he got into show business was just so he can be friends with Letterman, he has also questioned why anybody would watch his show instead of Letterman's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jimmy Kimmel Takes on Brooklyn and Two New Rivals|url=http://www.vulture.com/2012/10/jimmy-kimmel-live-gets-new-time-slot.html|work=[[Vulture.com]]|first=Jada|last=Yuan|date=October 21, 2012|accessdate=February 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kimmel wrote a piece for ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' writing his love for Letterman by saying, "As I write this, there are only 10 shows left before the funniest, most inventive and smartest man who ever wore an Alka Seltzer suit goes fishing for good. None of us who discovered Dave on our own and claimed him as our own will ever be able to satisfactorily explain to the younger people who didn’t what he did, what he meant and what he means. I guess it doesn’t matter. It’s only an exhibition, not a competition. Thanks Dave. For whatever it’s worth, you’re my favorite."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jimmy Kimmel: Watching David Letterman 'Was More Important Than Sleep'|url=http://time.com/3858014/david-letterman-jimmy-kimmel-tribute/|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|first=Jimmy|last=Kimmel|date=May 14, 2015|accessdate=February 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
