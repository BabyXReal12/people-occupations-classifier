'''Leo Anthony Gallagher Jr.''' (born July 24, 1946), known as '''Gallagher''', is an [[United States|American]] [[comedian]] and [[prop comic]], known for smashing [[watermelon]]s as part of his act.

==Early life==
Gallagher was born in [[Fort Bragg (North Carolina)|Fort Bragg]], [[North Carolina]], to a family of Irish and Croatian heritage.&lt;ref name= fee&gt;{{cite news| url= http://triblive.com/news/editorspicks/5895683-74/gallagher-ebaugh-uniontown| website= Triblive.com| title= $10K fee for Uniontown show not paid, comedian Gallagher claims| first= Carl| last= Prine| publisher= Trib Total Media, Inc. |date= April 6, 2014| accessdate= March 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the age of nine, he lived in [[Lorain, Ohio|Lorain]], [[Ohio]], but because of his asthma, the family moved to [[South Tampa]], [[Florida]], where he attended [[Henry B. Plant High School|H.B. Plant High School]]. He graduated from the [[University of South Florida]] with a [[chemical engineer]]ing [[academic degree|degree]] in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title= Meet Our 40 in 40 Outstanding Alumni|page=22|date= October 2009 |work= Alumni Voice |publisher= USFAlumni.org (University of South Florida Alumni Association)|url=http://www.usfalumni.org/s/861/images/editor_documents/Magazines/alumnivoice_oct2009.pdf|accessdate= March 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= fee /&gt; He [[minor (academic)|minored]] in [[English literature]], which he uses often in his skits to mock the language.

==Career==
After college, Gallagher began working as comic/musician [[Jim Stafford]]'s [[road manager]]. Stafford and Gallagher traveled to California in 1969, during which time Gallagher decided to perform himself. He began honing his own comedy act while frequenting both [[The Comedy Store]] and [[The Ice House (comedy club)|The Ice House]]. He was repeatedly denied appearance on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' in the 1970s and 1980s, as [[Johnny Carson]] disliked prop comedy.&lt;ref name="wtf"&gt;[http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episodes/episode_145_-_gallagher Episode 145 – Gallagher], ''[[WTF with Marc Maron]]'', wtfpod.com&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was liked by some of the program's staff, and Gallagher eventually performed several times on the show when guest hosts were filling in for Carson.&lt;ref name="wtf" /&gt; Gallagher first appeared on ''The Tonight Show'' Dec. 5, 1975, when he demonstrated his prop, "The Tonight Show Home Game", and Carson noted it was his first appearance. Gallagher again appeared on ''The Tonight Show'' on May 9, 1979, a show hosted by Carson.

Gallagher was one of the most popular and recognizable American comedians during the 1980s{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}. He did fourteen comedy specials for [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] which have been re-broadcast numerous times, notably on [[Comedy Central]].

Running for Governor (as an independent) in the 2003 [[California recall election]], Gallagher finished 16th out of 135 candidates with 5,466 votes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20141021000741/http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/sov/2003-special/ssov/gov_sum.pdf Special Statewide Election - Statement of Vote], California Secretary of State, October 7, 2003. retrieved on April 30, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conflict with brother===
In the early 1990s, Gallagher's younger brother Ron asked him for permission to perform shows using Gallagher's trademark Sledge-O-Matic routine. Gallagher granted his permission on the condition that Ron, who shared a strong likeness to Leo, and his manager clarified in promotional materials that it was Ron Gallagher, not Leo Gallagher, who was performing. Ron typically performed in venues smaller than those that Leo Gallagher performed in. After several years, Ron began promoting his act as Gallagher Too or Gallagher Two. In some instances, Ron's act was promoted in a way that left unclear the fact that he was not the original Gallagher.&lt;ref name="ronpeople"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Tears of a Clone|first= Alex |last= Tresniowski|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20131265,00.html|accessdate=16 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ron90ways"&gt;{{Cite web |title=The Hoax Report: Gallagher Too |first=Whitney |last=Seibold |website=90ways.com |url=http://90ways.com/critarchive/crit93.php |accessdate=16 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120622114015/http://90ways.com/critarchive/crit93.php |archivedate=22 June 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gallagher initially responded by requesting only that his brother not use the Sledge-O-Matic routine. Ron nonetheless continued to tour as Gallagher Too using the routine. In August 2000, Gallagher sued his brother for trademark violations and false advertising.&lt;ref name="ronpeople"/&gt; The courts ultimately sided with him, and an injunction was granted prohibiting Ron from performing any act that impersonated his brother in small clubs and venues. This injunction also prohibited Ron from intentionally bearing likeness to Leo.&lt;ref name="ron90ways"/&gt;

===Comedy style===
Gallagher's signature sketch is a pitch for the "Sledge-O-Matic," a large wooden mallet that he uses to smash a variety of food items and other objects, culminating with a [[watermelon]]. It also features a variety of props, including a large trampoline designed to look like a couch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/19125/Gallagher-Stuck-in-the-60s/overview |title=Gallagher: Stuck in the '60s (1984)|website=New York Times |accessdate=February 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Sledge-O-Matic act is an example of physical [[prop comedy]], the act itself (and even its name) is a [[parody]] of ads for the [[Ronco]] ''[[Veg-O-Matic]]'', a kitchen appliance that was heavily advertised on American television from the mid-1960s through the 1970s.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Gallagher also uses wordplay in his act, pointing out the eccentricities of the English language.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

In July 1999 he did a show in Cerritos, California in which he used stereotypes that were considered offensive towards Mexicans.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.latimes.com/1999/jul/03/entertainment/ca-52498&lt;/ref&gt;  In January 2011, Gallagher walked out of comedian [[Marc Maron]]'s ''[[WTF with Marc Maron|WTF]]'' [[podcast]] when Maron continued to ask Gallagher about the jokes after Gallagher had responded that, out of a two-to-three-hour show, they were only five jokes that he had heard in the street. In a subsequent interview which touched on the incident, Gallagher accused Maron of "taking the other side of everything".&lt;ref name="wtf" /&gt;&lt;ref name="scpr"&gt;{{cite news|website=scpr.org|publisher=[[Southern California Public Radio]]|url=http://www.scpr.org/blogs/newmedia/2011/01/31/2625/comedian-gallagher-yes-gallagher-walks-out-popular/ |title=Comedian Gallagher (yes, that Gallagher) walks out on popular comedy podcast WTF with Marc Maron|first=Mike |last=Roe |date=January 31, 2011|accessdate=February 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2012, Gallagher was featured in a television commercial for [[GEICO]] Insurance, repeating his Sledge-O-Matic bit.&lt;ref name=broke&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/02/gallagher-broke-living-in-hotels-heart-attack_n_1643655.html|title=Gallagher Broke, Living In Hotels, Lost Drivers License After Heart Attack: 'I Died In March'|date=July 2, 2012 |first=Katla |last=McGlynn|website=[[Huffington Post]]|accessdate=February 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
In 2004, [[Comedy Central]] rated Gallagher the 100th best stand-up comedian of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.listology.com/list/comedy-central-100-greatest-standups-all-time |title=Comedy Central 100 Greatest Standups of all Time| date= May 19, 2005| publisher= [[Comedy Central]]; republished at Listology.com| accessdate= March 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gallagher was displeased with being ranked so low, and he told ''[[The Oregonian]]'', "I looked at the other people and I was trying to find anyone I ever heard of. How could I be behind people I never heard of? ... I made 13 one-hour shows for Showtime, which are available on videotape. I invented the [[one-man show]] on cable."

==Personal life==
Gallagher lost nearly all of his fortune in stock market speculation gone wrong, and jokes that he is currently 'broke'. However, his longtime manager disputes this as a bit of comedic exaggeration, adding "We all need to be as broke as Leo".&lt;ref name=broke /&gt;

During a performance on March 10, 2011, in [[Rochester, Minnesota|Rochester]], [[Minnesota]], Gallagher collapsed on stage, gripping his chest. He was rushed to [[Saint Marys Hospital (Rochester)|Saint Marys Hospital]], where it was determined that he had suffered a minor heart attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.tmz.com/2011/03/10/gallagher-collapses-on-stage-comedian-sledgeomatic-minnesota-hospital/ |title= Gallagher Collapses on Stage| date= March 11, 2011| website= TMZ.com | accessdate= March 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A year later, on March 14, 2012, just before a performance in [[Lewisville, Texas|Lewisville]], [[Texas]], Gallagher began to experience intense chest pains. Gallagher's manager said the comic suffered a "mild to serious" heart attack and was placed in the hospital in a medically induced [[coma]] while doctors tried to determine what was wrong with his heart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.tmz.com/2012/03/14/gallagher-heart-attack/ |title= Gallagher Suffers Heart Attack Hospitalized in Texas| date= March 15, 2012| website=TMZ.com | accessdate= March 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2012/03/16/comedian-gallagher-placed-in-medically-induced-coma-after-heart-attack/?intcmp=features|title=Comedian Gallagher placed in medically induced coma after heart attack|website=FoxNews.com|date=16 March 2012|accessdate=16 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After replacing two [[coronary stent]]s, doctors slowly brought him out of the coma on March 18, 2012. He quickly recovered and started talking to his family. His manager, Christine Sherrer, stated that he was breathing on his own, moving, and telling jokes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tv.msn.com/tv/article.aspx?news=711875|title=Comic Gallagher is out of coma, telling jokes|publisher=[[MSN]].com|date=March 18, 2012| accessdate= March 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
