==Career==

===Comedy albums and films===
{{main|Cheech &amp; Chong}}
As a part of the highly successful comedy duo [[Cheech &amp; Chong]], Marin participated in a number of comedy albums and feature film comedies in the 1970s and 1980s.  Tommy Chong directed four of their films while co-writing and starring in all seven with Marin.

===Later films and television work===
After Cheech &amp; Chong disbanded in 1985, Marin starred in a number of films as a solo actor, most notably ''[[Born in East L.A. (film)|Born in East L.A.]]'', ''[[The Shrimp on the Barbie]]'', ''[[Tin Cup]]'', and ''[[Once Upon a Time in Mexico]]''. He made a cameo appearance as a dockworker in ''[[Ghostbusters II]]''. In 2004 he made his second appearance as a policeman, as "Officer Salino" in the film adaptation of John Grisham's holiday novel "Skipping Christmas", under the title "Christmas With the Kranks", starring Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis.

Marin made the transition to full-time television work when he co-starred on the short-lived ''[[The Golden Girls]]'' spin-off ''[[The Golden Palace]]'' (1992–1993), and later with [[Don Johnson]], Jaime P. Gomez, and [[Yasmine Bleeth]] in the police show ''[[Nash Bridges]]'' (1996–2001), in which they played San Francisco police-detective partners.  In recent years he has been active in playing supporting roles in films and performing [[voice over]]s for animated features. After appearing in a supporting role in ''[[Judging Amy]]'', playing an independently wealthy [[landscape designer]], Marin starred in the CBS sitcom ''[[Rob (TV series)|Rob]]'', with [[Rob Schneider]].

Marin is a frequent collaborator of the director [[Robert Rodriguez]], who has worked with Marin seven times; the last two installments of the [[Mexico Trilogy|''Mexico'' trilogy]], the [[Spy Kids trilogy|''Spy Kids'' trilogy]], ''[[From Dusk Till Dawn (film)|From Dusk Till Dawn]]'' and ''[[Machete (2010 film)|Machete]]''. He provided his voice for several [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]] animated films, most notably Tito the [[Chihuahua (dog)|Chihuahua]] in ''[[Oliver &amp; Company]]'' (1988), [[Shenzi, Banzai and Ed|Banzai]] the [[Spotted hyena|hyena]] in ''[[The Lion King]]'' (1994), and Ramone in ''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]'' (2006) and its sequels ''[[Cars 2]]'' (2011) and ''[[Cars 3]]'' (2017). He also played Pancho in ''[[The Cisco Kid (1994 film)|The Cisco Kid]]'' (1994), and reprised the Banzai role in the video game ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]''.

===Children's music albums and related works===
Marin has released two best-selling albums in the children's music genre, ''My Name is Cheech, the School Bus Driver'' (1992) and ''My Name is Cheech, The School Bus Driver "Coast to Coast"'' (1997).  Both albums were released bilingually. In July 2007, the book ''Cheech the School Bus Driver'' was released, written by Marin, illustrated by Orlando L. Ramirez, and published by [[HarperCollins]].

In 2005, Marin lent his voice to the animated children's series ''[[Dora the Explorer]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nickjr.com/kids-videos/dora-a-crown-for-king-bobo.html Nickelodeon. IMDB, ''A Crown for King Bobo.'' Aired October 23, 2005] Retrieved 2013-05-29&lt;/ref&gt; He appeared in the episode "A Crown for King Juan el Bobo", as the Puerto Rican folk hero [[Juan Bobo]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1902033/ IMDB, A Crown for King Bobo] Retrieved 2013-05-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Additional television appearances===
In late 2006, Marin participated in [[Simon Cowell]]'s ''[[Celebrity Duets]]'', having sung with [[Peter Frampton]], [[Randy Travis]], [[Clint Black]], [[Aaron Neville]], and [[Al Jarreau]].  He was the fourth to be eliminated. In that same year, he voiced as Gaspar Gomez in ''[[Scarface: The World Is Yours]]''.

Marin had a recurring role in the hit television series ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'', playing David Reyes, [[Hugo "Hurley" Reyes|Hurley]]'s father.

He was a co-host for ''[[WWE Raw]]'' on March 1, 2010, with his comedy partner [[Tommy Chong]], in [[Oklahoma City]].

Marin also sings on the hidden track "[[Earache My Eye]]" on [[Korn]]'s album ''[[Follow the Leader (Korn album)|Follow the Leader]]''.

In 2009, he appeared in the [[Hallmark Channel]] movie [[Expecting a Miracle]].

On March 18, 2010, Marin beat journalist [[Anderson Cooper]] and actress [[Aisha Tyler]] on ''[[Celebrity Jeopardy!]]'''s Million Dollar Celebrity Invitational. Cooper admitted he was "crushed" by Marin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediaite.com/online/another-cnn-anchor-fails-at-celebrity-jeopardy/|title=Another CNN Anchor Fails At Celebrity Jeopardy|author=Steve Krakauer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marin also won his semifinal round early May but lost in the May 6–7 final to [[Michael McKean]]. He had previously won the first ''Celebrity Jeopardy!'' tournament in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.looktothestars.org/news/4366-cheech-marin-donates-jeopardy-winnings-to-charity |title=Cheech Marin Donates '&amp;#39;Jeopardy!'&amp;#39; Winnings to Charity |publisher=Looktothestars.org |date= |accessdate=2015-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2012, he was one of eight celebrities participating in the [[Food Network]] [[reality series]] ''[[Rachael vs. Guy: Celebrity Cook-Off]]''.

==Other interests==
Marin is an avid collector of [[Chicano]] art. Two national touring exhibitions have featured works from his private collection. Marin started collecting Chicano art in the 1980s. He feels that it's important to "use his celebrity status to call attention to what he saw as an under-appreciated and under-represented style of art."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=nfh&amp;AN=2W62808111468&amp;site=ehost-live|title = In collection, W&amp;L talk, Cheech Marin champions Chicano art|last = Allen|first = Mike|date = 21 April 2013|work = The Roanoke Times|access-date = 26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is an avid golfer, although he initially disliked the sport until he co-starred in ''[[Tin Cup]]''. He also enjoys horse archery, which he practices on a special course that he has built on his private land.

On April 19, 2018, Cheech (as part of GLE Brands Inc) signed an agreement with Heritage Cannabis Holdings Corporation (CSE: CANN) to have exclusive rights to use cannabis and cannabis related products utilizing the Private Stash brand throughout Canada for a period of 2 years, with the agreement automatically renewing for an additional year upon achieving various milestones.

==Personal life==
Marin was married in 1975 to Darlene Morley, who co-produced ''[[Cheech &amp; Chong's The Corsican Brothers]]'' and also played minor roles in earlier Cheech &amp; Chong films under the name Rikki Marin.  The couple had one child.[[divorce]]d in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0547499/|title=Rikki Marin|website=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marin married artist Patti Heid in 1986; they had two children and have since divorced. Patti is responsible for his interest in Chicano art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001507/bio|title=Cheech Marin|website=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marin married his longtime girlfriend, Russian pianist Natasha Rubin, on August 8, 2009, in a sunset ceremony at their home.

Marin resides in [[Malibu, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Limelight Listing – Cheech Marin's Malibu home|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/g/a/2011/06/03/Limelight_Listing.DTL|work=[[SFGate]]|date=3 June 2011|accessdate=6 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
