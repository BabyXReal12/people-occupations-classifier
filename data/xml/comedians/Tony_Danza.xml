He is best known for starring on the TV series ''[[Taxi (TV series)|Taxi]]'' and ''[[Who's the Boss?]]'', for which he was nominated for an [[Emmy Award]] and four [[Golden Globe Awards]]. In 1998, Danza won the [[People's Choice Award]] for Favorite Male Performer in a New Television Series for his work on the 1997 sitcom ''[[The Tony Danza Show (1997 TV series)|The Tony Danza Show]]'' (not to be confused with his 2004–2006 daytime variety talk show [[The Tony Danza Show (2004 talk show)|of the same name]]).

==Biography==
Danza was born in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]],&lt;ref name=filmref /&gt; to parents Anne Cammisa (1925–1993) and Matty Iadanza (1920–1983) &lt;ref name=vart1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR108166?refCatId=25|title=Ann Iadanza|publisher=''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''|date=June 23, 1993|accessdate=May 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother was a bookkeeper and his father worked as a [[waste collector]] in Brooklyn.&lt;ref name="filmref"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.filmreference.com/film/34/Tony-Danza.html | title= Tony Danza Biography (1951-) | publisher= FilmReference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2008-06-13/entertainment/17900765_1_tony-danza-show-meatball-recipe-song-and-dance|title=Tony Danza's the boss in the kitchen with new cookbook|last=Wharton|first=Rachel|date=13 June 2008|work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]] |location=New York|accessdate=May 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Danza's father was an American of Italian ancestry and Danza's mother was an immigrant from the town of [[Campobello di Mazara]] in the [[Sicily|Sicilian]] province of [[Province of Trapani|Trapani]].&lt;ref name=vart1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.walkoffame.com/tony-danza&lt;/ref&gt; He has a younger brother, Matty Jr. (born 1954), a Los Angeles restaurant owner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/participant.jsp?spid=44161&amp;apid=0 Tony Danza's TCM bio]&lt;/ref&gt; When Danza was 14, he and his family relocated to [[Malverne, New York]], on [[Long Island]]. Danza attended [[Valley Stream North High School]], graduating in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/tv/tony-danza-is-not-too-cool-for-school-1.2324169|title=Tony Danza is not too cool for school|author=Verne Gay|date=September 29, 2010|accessdate=May 26, 2012|work=[[Newsday]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first episode of his show ''Teach: Tony Danza'', Danza describes himself as a "bad student" in high school. He earned a bachelor's degree in history in 1972 from the [[University of Dubuque]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dbq.edu/news/news1.cfm?ID=89 University of Dubuque website]&lt;/ref&gt; which he attended on a wrestling scholarship. In 1975, as a joke, Danza's friends entered him in the New York City Golden Gloves. After knocking out his first six opponents all in the first round, Danza was knocked out in the finals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boxing-scoop.com/show_boxer.php?boxer_ID=12264 Tony Danza profile], boxing-scoop.com; accessed May 20, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

During his first year of college, he had the [[Robert Crumb]] "[[Keep on Truckin' (comics)|Keep on Truckin']]" character tattooed on his upper right arm. In a 1985 interview in ''[[Us Weekly]]'' magazine, Danza remarked, "I was playing pool with a guy who had all these tattoos, and I wanted to be friends."&lt;ref&gt;"Danza, Father and (Finally) Grown-up" by Steve Pond. ''Us Weekly'', August 26, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; Danza also sports a "Keep Punching" boxing gloves tattoo on his right shoulder as well as "Tracy", his (former) wife's name, on his chest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tony Danza President Puncher|url=http://www.maxim.com/tv/guy-tv/70062/tony-danza-president-puncher.html|publisher=Maxim|accessdate=June 17, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AbbJr0rH?url=http://www.maxim.com/tv/tony-danza-president-puncher|archivedate=September 11, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In college, Danza met and married his first wife.

==Career==
===Boxer===
Danza was a professional [[Boxing|boxer]] with a record of 9–3 (9 knockouts, 7 in the first round), with all but one of his fights, wins and losses, ending in a [[knockout]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Dan|last=Rafael|title='The Contender' to feature two ex-title challengers; TV star Danza to host|date=2008-10-01|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/boxing/news/story?id=3615214|publisher=ESPN.com|accessdate=2008-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Acting and show business===
Shortly after his college graduation from the University of Dubuque, Danza was discovered by a producer at a boxing gymnasium in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dailydanza.com/about/|title=Meet Tony|publisher=dailydanza.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then earned a spot on the television show ''[[Taxi (TV series)|Taxi]]'', playing a [[cab driver]] and part-time boxer Tony Banta, and later starred on ''[[Who's the Boss?]]'', in which he portrayed a former baseball player, housekeeper, and single father Tony Micelli.  For his contribution to the television industry, in 1988, Danza was honored with a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 7000 [[Hollywood Boulevard]].  Danza also plays the role of a baseball player in ''[[Angels in the Outfield (1994 film)|Angels in the Outfield]]'' (1994).

Danza also starred in the short-lived sitcoms ''[[Hudson Street (TV series)|Hudson Street]]'' (1995) and ''[[The Tony Danza Show (1997 TV series)|The Tony Danza Show]]'' (1997), not to be confused with his 2004–2006 talk show, ''[[The Tony Danza Show (2004 talk show)|The Tony Danza Show]]''. He had a role in the TV drama ''[[Family Law (TV series)|Family Law]]'' from 2000 until 2002.

He was nominated for an [[Emmy Award]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/tony-danza | title= Tony Danza: Awards and Nominations| website= Emmys.com| publisher= Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences| date= | access-date= February 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a guest-starring 1998 role in the TV series ''[[The Practice]]''. His [[film|movie]] debut was in the comedy ''[[The Hollywood Knights]]'' ([[1980 in film|1980]]), which was followed by ''[[Going Ape!]]'' ([[1981 in film|1981]]). He received critical acclaim for his performance in the 1999 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] revival of the [[Eugene O'Neill]] [[Play (theatre)|play]] ''[[The Iceman Cometh]]''. In 2002, Danza released his debut album ''The House I Live In'' as a 1950s-style [[crooner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www0.epinions.com/review/musc_mu-463434/content_258810023556 | title= The House I Live In by Tony Danza| website= epinions.com| date= 2011| deadurl= yes| archivedate= April 26, 2012| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120426174036/http://www.epinions.com/review/musc_mu-463434/content_258810023556| accessdate= February 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Danza hosted his own TV talk show, ''[[The Tony Danza Show (2004 talk show)|The Tony Danza Show]]'', that was produced each weekday morning in his hometown of New York and was [[television syndication|syndicated]] across the US. On May 9, 2005, during a [[go-kart]] race with [[NASCAR]] star [[Rusty Wallace]], who was a guest on the show, Danza's kart flipped after Wallace accidentally bumped him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wallace swaps go-cart paint with Danza|url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/7794363/|accessdate=June 17, 2011| work= MSNBC.com |date= May 10, 2005|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Neither he nor Wallace was wearing a helmet at the time, but both were uninjured. Danza returned to go-kart racing on October 20, 2005, to challenge [[Indy Racing League|IndyCar]] driver [[Danica Patrick]], but his brakes malfunctioned and he skidded into a wall, unharmed. His daytime talk show ended in May 2006; the last live episode aired on May 26, 2006.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

Danza was to host the 4th season of ''[[The Contender (TV series)|The Contender]]'' in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realitytvworld.com/news/the-contender-reveals-fourth-season-cast-tony-danza-host-7804.php|title=Danza hosts ''The Contender''|first= John| last= Bracchitta|date=September 30, 2008|website= RealityTVWorld.com|accessdate=October 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June of 2017, [[Netflix]] announced that Danza would star in a new series, ''[[The Good Cop]]''.

Club, June 19, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teaching===
In August 2009, it was reported that Danza would appear in a new [[A&amp;E Network|A&amp;E]] [[reality show]] ''[[Teach: Tony Danza]]'', in which he would co-instruct a 10th grade English class at [[Northeast High School (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania)|Northeast High School]] in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]].
