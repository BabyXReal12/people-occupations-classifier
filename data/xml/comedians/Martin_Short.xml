==Career==

===Early career===
When Short graduated from [[McMaster University]], he intended to pursue a career in social work; however, he became interested in acting once he was cast in a [[Toronto]] production of ''[[Godspell]]'' that same year.&lt;ref name=moviestimes&gt;{{cite news|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/person/65439/Martin-Short |title=Martin Short Biography at New York Times |work=New York Times |accessdate=August 26, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071205164854/http://movies.nytimes.com/person/65439/Martin-Short |archivedate=December 5, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among other members of that production's cast were [[Victor Garber]], [[Gilda Radner]], [[Eugene Levy]], [[Dave Thomas (actor)|Dave Thomas]], and [[Andrea Martin]]; [[Paul Shaffer]] was the [[musical director]].&lt;ref name=tcmbio&gt;[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/person/176806%7C0/Martin-Short/milestones.html "Martin Short Milestones at TCM"] tcm.com, accessed August 26, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; He was subsequently cast in several television shows and plays, including the drama ''Fortune and Men's Eyes'' (1972).&lt;ref name=tcmbio/&gt; He worked solely in [[Canada]] through 1979.

===''SCTV''===
Short was encouraged to pursue comedy by McMaster classmates [[Eugene Levy]] and [[Dave Thomas (actor)|Dave Thomas]], whom he joined in the improvisation group [[The Second City]] in Toronto, Ontario&lt;ref&gt;Martin Short's Autobiography "I Must Say"&lt;/ref&gt; in 1977.&lt;ref name=moviestimes/&gt; He came to public notice when the group produced a show for television, ''[[Second City Television]]'' or ''SCTV'', which ran for several years in Canada, then the United States. Short appeared on ''SCTV'' in 1982–83.&lt;ref name=moviestimes/&gt; At ''SCTV,'' Short developed several characters before moving on to ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' for the 1984–85 season:

* Talk show host Brock Linehan, based on the Canadian interviewer [[Brian Linehan]]
* Aged songwriter [[Irving Cohen]], commonly thought to be loosely based on American composers [[Irving Caesar]] and/or [[Irving Berlin]], but actually (according to Short in his autobiography) inspired by [[Sophie Tucker]]
* Entertainer [[Jackie Rogers, Jr.]]
* Current-events commentator Troy Soren
* Industrialist and art patron Bradley P. Allen
* Defense attorney [[Recurring Saturday Night Live characters and sketches introduced 1984–1985#Nathan Thurm|Nathan Thurm]]

"Short's appearance on ''SNL'' helped to revive the show's fanbase, which had flagged after the departure of [[Eddie Murphy]], and in turn, would launch his successful career in films and television."&lt;ref name=tcmlong/&gt; His ''SNL'' characters included numerous holdovers from his ''SCTV'' days. He also did impressions of such celebrities as [[Jerry Lewis]] and [[Katharine Hepburn]].&lt;ref name=saturday/&gt;

Early on, he despaired at being left behind by friends such as Paul Shaffer, Gilda Radner, and Bill Murray. But at 62 he stands alone in the comedy firmament, adored by Hollywood’s elite as the funniest, nicest, best of them all,"] ''Vanity Fair,'' January 2013.
