'''Kathleen Mary Griffin''' (born November 4, 1960) is an American comedian and [[actress]]. She has starred in several comedy specials for cable TV and has released several comedy albums. In 2007 and 2008, Griffin won [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s for her reality show ''[[Kathy Griffin: My Life on the D-List]]''. She has also appeared on TV and on film numerous times, mainly in supporting roles.

Born in [[Oak Park, Illinois]], she moved to Los Angeles in 1978, where she studied drama at the [[Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute]] and became a member of the improvisational comedy troupe [[The Groundlings]]. In the 1990s, Griffin began performing as a stand-up comedian and also appeared as a guest star on several television shows. She achieved wider recognition after her role as a supporting character in the [[NBC]] sitcom ''[[Suddenly Susan]]'' (1996–2000).

Her Bravo reality show ''[[Kathy Griffin: My Life on the D-List]]'' (2005–2010) became a ratings hit for the network and earned her two [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Reality Program|Emmy Awards for Outstanding Reality Program]]. Griffin has released six comedy albums, all of which received [[Grammy Award]] nominations. Her first album, ''[[For Your Consideration (album)|For Your Consideration]]'' (2008), made her the first female comedian to debut at the top of the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Comedy Albums|Top Comedy Albums]] chart. In 2009, she released her autobiography, ''Official Book Club Selection: A Memoir According to Kathy Griffin''.

Griffin has taped numerous standup comedy specials with [[HBO]] and [[Bravo (U.S. TV network)|Bravo]]. For the latter network, she has recorded 16 television specials, breaking the [[Guinness World Records|Guinness World record]] for the number of aired TV specials on any network, by any comedian in the history of comedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.okmagazine.com/news/get-sneak-peek-kathy-griffins-love-justin-bieber-her-new-bravo-special|title=Get a Sneak Peek Of Kathy Griffin's Love For Justin Bieber in Her New Bravo Special!|first=Palmieri|last=Lea|work=[[OK! magazine]]|publisher=[[Northern &amp; Shell]]|date=June 3, 2013|access-date=June 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Janela|first1=Mike|title=Kathy Griffin to be honored with record in, well, "Record Breaker" special|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2013/12/kathy-griffin-to-be-honored-with-record-in-well-record-breaker-special-53801|publisher=Guinness World Records| accessdate=January 3, 2016|date=December 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, she also became the first comedian to have four televised specials in a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/12/16/rachael-ray-kathy-griffin-tired-hooker-four-specials-video_n_1152883.html|title='Rachael Ray': Kathy Griffin Explains 'Tired Hooker,' Inspiration For Comedy Specials (VIDEO)|work=[[HuffPost]]|date=December 16, 2011|access-date=March 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from her comedy career, she is an [[LGBT]] activist involved in causes such as [[same-sex marriage]] and the repeal of "[[Don't ask, don't tell]]". She has also participated in two [[United Service Organizations|USO]] tours. Griffin is known for her conversational style and controversial statements on celebrities, religion and sexuality. After being nominated for six years in a row for the Grammy for [[Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album|Best Comedy Album]], she won the award in 2014.

==Early life==
Kathleen Mary Griffin was born on November 4, 1960, in the Chicago suburb of [[Oak Park, Illinois]],&lt;ref name=biography.com&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/kathy-griffin-21230365#suddenly-susan|title=Kathy Griffin biography|publisher=Biography.com|accessdate=May 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; to Mary Margaret "Maggie" Griffin (née Corbally) and John Patrick Griffin, both first-generation Irish-Americans.&lt;ref name="griffin1"&gt;{{harvnb|Griffin|2010|pp=7–9, 11, 13, 15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maggie Griffin worked as a cashier for Oak Park Hospital. Griffin has four older siblings: Kenny, Joyce (died 2017), Gary (died 2014), and John. Griffin described herself during her early years as "a kid who needed to talk, all the time".&lt;ref name="griffin1"/&gt; Her brother Gary and her sister Joyce both died from cancer.&lt;ref&gt;http://people.com/celebrity/kathy-griffins-brother-gary-griffin-dies-of-cancer/&lt;/ref&gt;

She would often visit her neighbors, the Bowens, to tell them stories about her family; she has referred to those visits as her first live shows and the place where she learned "the power of juicy material".&lt;ref name="griffin1"/&gt; After most of her siblings had moved, Griffin often spent hours alone in the house and developed a [[binge eating disorder]]. She explained that even though [[eating disorder]]s were not very well known at that time, she knew her eating behavior was aberrant and always threw the garbage away in the neighbor's can.&lt;ref name="griffin2"&gt;{{harvnb|Griffin|2010|pp=20–21, 26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her 2009 autobiography ''Official Book Club Selection'', Griffin confessed that she "still suffers [from food issues]" but has learned to "deal with them".&lt;ref name="griffin2"/&gt;

In the same book, Griffin discussed her eldest brother, Kenny, who was a drug addict and homeless at various times, and revealed that she was "afraid of him until the moment he died" due to his violent, abusive nature. Griffin states that Kenny would climb into bed with her when he was 30 and she was 7 and "whisper" into her ears; Kathy refused to speak to him or be in the same room as him for years but did not tell her parents until she was in her twenties, at which point he openly admitted pedophilia to their parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|cyFHWt3TcTc|Kathy Griffin on Tyra - Part 2/5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a young girl, Griffin attended St. Bernadine's Elementary School and began to develop a dislike for organized religion because of the punishments she and other "vulnerable" students received from the nuns.&lt;ref name="griffin2"/&gt;

After graduation, she attended [[Oak Park and River Forest High School]] and sought refuge in musical theatre, playing roles such as Rosemary in ''[[How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying]]'' and Hodel in ''[[Fiddler on the Roof]]''.&lt;ref name="griffin3"&gt;{{harvnb|Griffin|2010|pp=32–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; During her senior year she began arguing with her parents, who wanted her to attend college, because she wanted to become a professional actress. Her first appearance on television was as an extra on a [[Chicago White Sox]] commercial, and she was signed with several Chicago talent agencies. At 18, Griffin persuaded her parents to move to Los Angeles to help her become famous.&lt;ref name="griffin3"/&gt;

At 19, Griffin attended a show of the California-based improvisational group [[The Groundlings]]. She said, "I thought this is where I want to be. This is the greatest thing in the world."&lt;ref name="griffin4"&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Griffin|2010|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===Stand-up comedy, TV, and film===
Griffin began performing in the early 1980s in the Los Angeles [[Improvisational theatre#Improvisational comedy|improv comedy]] troupe [[The Groundlings]].&lt;ref name="groundlingsalumnikathygriffin"&gt;{{cite web|title=Performers: KATHY GRIFFIN: Alumni|url=http://www.groundlings.com/performers/performer-details.aspx?performerID=149|website=The Goundlings| access-date=February 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an ''[[E! True Hollywood Story]]'' segment, she stated that she often went to see the Groundlings perform before she joined. She said that, at one show, she went backstage and talked with Groundling member [[Phil Hartman]] and asked him what the group was all about. This led to her taking classes there and eventually being asked into the Groundling's main company. While Kathy was a Groundling, she became best friends with [[Judy Toll]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

She went on to perform standup comedy and became part of the [[alternative comedy]] scene in Los Angeles. She appeared at [[Un-Cabaret]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} and ran her own standup night, Hot Cup of Talk, with [[Janeane Garofalo]]. That later became the title of her 1998 solo [[HBO]] special.&lt;ref name="Chat"&gt;{{cite news|title=Fast Chat: Q &amp; A with Kathy Griffin|work=Newsday|first=Frank|last=Lovece|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/186583331/Newsday-Fast-Chat-Kathy-Griffinl|date=June 18, 2006|access-date=November 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Griffin made an appearance in [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s 1994 film ''[[Pulp Fiction]]'' as a pedestrian coming to the aid of Marcellus Wallace ([[Ving Rhames]]) after he is hit by a car driven by Butch Coolidge ([[Bruce Willis]]). In the credits she was listed as herself. She broke into film in the supporting role of Connie in the [[horror film]] ''[[The Unborn (1991 film)|The Unborn]]''.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Griffin gradually amassed a number of TV and film credits throughout the 1990s. She appeared in fellow comedian [[Julie Brown]]'s ''[[Medusa: Dare to Be Truthful]]'', a [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] parody of the 1991 [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] film ''[[Madonna: Truth or Dare|Truth or Dare]]''. Griffin had two appearances as the character Susan Klein, a reporter, on [[NBC]]'s ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]'', her TV sitcom debut.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

She appeared in fellow comic [[Bobcat Goldthwait]]'s film ''[[Shakes the Clown]]'' and as the enthusiastic leader of a fanatical car club in the ''[[Ellen (TV series)|Ellen]]'' episode "Oh, Sweet Rapture", airing in January 1996. Griffin played Jerry's nemesis Sally Weaver in two episodes of ''[[Seinfeld]]''. She starred in a dual role in a seventh-season episode of ''[[The X-Files]]'' and in an episode of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s divorce-attorney series ''[[Civil Wars (TV series)|Civil Wars]]'', Griffin's dramatic-series debut.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

After starring in an ''[[HBO]] Half Hour Comedy Special'', Griffin had her first consistent public exposure in 1996, when she was cast as the acerbic colleague of [[Brooke Shields]]' title character on the NBC sitcom ''[[Suddenly Susan]]''{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}. In 1998, Griffin starred in her first one-hour special, HBO's ''Kathy Griffin: A Hot Cup of Talk''. She honed a comedy and television career that poked fun at her relatively modest place in the Hollywood hierarchy in a self-deprecating manner.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} She frequently appears in such self-consciously tacky projects as the reality show competition ''[[The Mole (U.S. season 3)|Celebrity Mole]] Hawaii'', in which she won the 2003 edition after undergoing such experiences as walking over hot [[lava]] with her bare feet. She identifies her victory as the moment she became a "D-list" celebrity.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

[[File:KathyGriffin.png|thumb|upright|Griffin performing stand up in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] in 2008]]
Griffin also has a secondary career in [[voice-over]] work and has been featured on a variety of projects such as the [[animated series]] ''[[Dilbert (TV series)|Dilbert]]'' and ''[[Spider-Man: The New Animated Series]]''. Her television production company is called Inappropriate Laughter.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

On June 12, 2008, Griffin hosted the first [[Bravo (Canada)|Bravo!]] A-List Awards. Included in the show was a scene wherein Griffin mimicked a "[[wardrobe malfunction]]" (referring to the [[Janet Jackson]] [[Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime-show controversy|Super Bowl halftime show controversy]] in 2004). She also hosted the 2009 Bravo A-List Awards, which aired on April&amp;nbsp;15, 2009, and her Bravo special ''Kathy Griffin: [[She'll Cut a Bitch]]'', taped on March 4, 2009, in [[Portland, Oregon]], aired beforehand. [[Shout! Factory]] released an extended version of the show on DVD in early 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shoutfactorystore.com/prod.aspx?pfid=5257079|title=Kathy Griffin: She'll Cut A Bitch|work=shoutfactorystore.com|year=2011|access-date=September 10, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930202719/http://www.shoutfactorystore.com/prod.aspx?pfid=5257079|archivedate=September 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 8, 2009, [[Ballantine Books]] published Griffin's memoir, titled ''Official Book Club Selection: A Memoir According to Kathy Griffin''. The book debuted at No. 1 on [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]]. A week prior, she released her second comedy album, ''[[Suckin' It for the Holidays]]''. It was the comedian's second bid to win a [[Grammy Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/LIFE/usaedition/2010-06-08-griffin08_CV_U.htm|title= Griffin finally runs with the big dogs|first=Gary|last=Strauss|work=USA Today|date=June 7, 2010|publisher=[[Gannett Company|Gannett]]|location=McLean, VA|issn=0734-7456|access-date=September 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|publisher=ABC|date=November 4, 2009|title= Let's Dance, New Comedic Dance Series Featuring Stars Competing for Charitable Grand Prizes, Premieres Monday, November 23|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?id=20091104abc03|access-date=September 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was announced on November 3, 2009, that Griffin was to host ABC's new show ''Let's Dance'', which was supposed to premiere after the finale of ''[[Dancing with the Stars]]'' on November 23. On the show, celebrity contestants would have reenacted famous routines from past music videos, movies, and musicals while competing for a $250,000 grand prize for their favorite charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Kate|last=Stanhope|date=November 3, 2009| title=Kathy Griffin to Host New ABC Show ''Let's Dance''|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Griffin-Lets-Dance-1011543.aspx|work=TVGuide.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the show never aired.

Griffin hosted [[CNN]]'s New Year's Eve Broadcast on December 31, 2009, along with [[Anderson Cooper]]. As Cooper talked about the [[Balloon boy hoax]], Griffin said the word "fucking" while making fun of the pronunciation of Falcon Heene, the six-year-old boy who was said to have been trapped in the balloon gondola.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/01/AR2010010101653.html|title=Kathy Griffin rings in 2010 by uttering profanity about Balloon Boy on CNN|work=The Washington Post|date=January 2, 2010|publisher=[[Graham Holdings Company|The Washington Post Company]]|location=Washington, D.C.|issn=0190-8286|access-date=September 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Griffin was rumored to be banned from future CNN broadcasts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/01/05/kathy-griffin-banned-from_n_411597.html|title=CNN Denies Kathy Griffin Banned From Network|work=Huffington Post|date=January 5, 2010| access-date=September 10, 2011|first=Nick|last=Graham}}&lt;/ref&gt; she co-hosted the show with Cooper until 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/12/31/us-kathygriffin-idUSTRE6BU29A20101231|title=Kathy Griffin dares to be thrown off New Year's show|first=Bryan|last=Alexander|agency=Reuters|date=December 31, 2010|access-date=September 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; CNN terminated Griffin from their New Year's Eve Broadcast in 2017, after Griffin posted pictures of herself holding a bloody, decapitated model head resembling President Donald Trump.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/30/entertainment/kathy-griffin-trump-tyler-shields/index.html|title=Kathy Griffin: 'I beg for your forgiveness' for gruesome anti-Trump photo shoot|last=CNN|first=Sandra Gonzalez|website=CNN|accessdate=May 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Griffin has also guest-starred in an episode of ''[[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit]]'', playing a lesbian activist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Kathy-Griffin-Lands-1011867.aspx|title=Kathy Griffin Lands Law &amp; Order: SVU Guest Spot|first=Natalie|last=Abrams|work=tvguide.com|date=November 10, 2009|access-date=September 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 2008 presidential election Griffin has made frequent jokes about Republican vice-presidential contender [[Sarah Palin]] and family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popeater.com/2010/12/06/kathy-griffins-teasing-bristol-palin-vh1-divas|title=Troops Boo Kathy Griffin for Bristol Palin Fat Jokes|first=Rob|last=Shuter|work=popeater.com|date=December 6, 2010|access-date=September 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Griffin parodied Palin in ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]'', wearing a red power-suit and wide-rimmed glasses, posing as a judge at the regionals singing competition. Griffin also poked fun at [[Christine O'Donnell]] in the show by stating, "Before we start, I would like to say I am not a witch."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-31749_162-20043841-10391698.html|title=Kathy Griffin plays a Tea Party politician on 'Glee'|work=[[CBS News]]|date=March 16, 2011|publisher=[[CBS]]|location=New York|access-date=September 10, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110319060347/http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-31749_162-20043841-10391698.html|archivedate=March 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2011/03/16/kathy_griffin_mocks_palintea_party_on_fox_show_glee.html|title=RealClearPolitics – Video – Kathy Griffin Mocks Palin/Tea Party On FOX Show 'GLEE'|work=realclearpolitics.com|date=March 16, 2011|access-date=September 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 15, 2011, Griffin had a guest-starring role on ''Glee'' in the episode "[[Original Song]]" as a Regionals competition judge, "Twitterer and former [[Tea Party movement|Tea Party]] candidate" Tammy Jean Albertson. Her character complained about a [[duet]] of [[Hey Monday]]'s "[[Candles (EP)|Candles]]" between two young men, [[Kurt Hummel]] and [[Blaine Anderson]], and automatically accused their school, Dalton Academy, of being a "gay school". She also remarks that the performance of "[[Loser Like Me]]" by the show's primary Glee club, New Directions, was disgraceful because "when I lost the election, I didn't sing about being a loser, I twittered that [[Barack Obama|Obama]] is a terrorist"; this remark almost started an argument between her and fellow judge Sister Mary Constance ([[Loretta Devine]]).{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

On January 7, 2012, it was announced that&amp;mdash;along with having two more standup specials on Bravo&amp;mdash;Griffin will start a weekly one-hour talk show on the channel, ''[[Kathy (TV series)|Kathy]]'', which will consist of standup routines, "rant about pop culture", and celebrity interviews.&lt;ref name="tv-guide-jan5-griffin-shows"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Kathy-Griffin-Bravo-1041343.aspx|title=Kathy Griffin Will Keep Talking for Bravo|first=Michael|last=Schneider|publisher=[[Pop (U.S. TV network)|TV Guide Network]]|date=January 7, 2012|access-date=January 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first show aired on April 19, 2012, on Bravo. Griffin announced via Twitter on July 26, 2012, that the show had been picked up for a second season.

On April 8, 2013, during a live standup performance in Cincinnati, Ohio, Griffin reportedly announced that her show would not be renewed for a third season. She later confirmed it on her Twitter account. A source close to the series told FOX 411 that Bravo is planning to film several comedy specials starring Griffin after the show wraps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2013/04/08/kathy-griffins-bravo-show-canceled|work=Fox News|title=Souce: Bravo cancels Kathy Griffin series but plans comedy specials for star|date=April 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 13, 2014, it was announced that Griffin was set to host the [[41st Daytime Emmy Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/kathy-griffin-daytime-emmys-1083029.aspx|title=Kathy Griffin Picked to Host the 2014 Daytime Emmy Awards|first=Tim|last=Surette|work=TV Guide|date=June 13, 2014| access-date=June 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the first time in the event's four-decade history, the show bypassed a network television airing for a live online [[streaming media|streaming]] event.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/syndication-and-distribution/daytime-emmys-be-streamed-online/131605 "Daytime Emmys to Be Streamed Online"], from ''Broadcasting &amp; Cable'', 6/5/2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Guest co-host of ''The View''===
Kathy Griffin served as the unofficial guest co-host of ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]'' from May 2007 to September 2007 and was considered as a replacement for the recently departed [[Rosie O'Donnell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Bill|last=Harris|url=http://jam.canoe.ca/Television/2007/07/09/4324611-sun.html|title=Griffin unsure about ''The View'' gig|work=canoe.ca|date=August 4, 2007|access-date=August 6, 2007|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/67IDLTCPu?url=http://jam.canoe.ca/Television/2007/07/09/4324611-sun.html|archive-date=April 29, 2012|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Mark|last=Dagostino|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20040461,00.html|title=Kathy Griffin: Split-Screen Made Rosie Leave The View|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]|date=May 27, 2007|access-date=August 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Whoopi Goldberg]] was ultimately selected as the permanent replacement. On September 10, 2007, [[Sherri Shepherd]] took over the remaining co-host spot that had been vacant since [[Star Jones]]'s departure.

Griffin divulged in her standup that she is banned from ''The View'' after talking about the gig on her televised comedy special, ''Kathy Griffin: Straight to Hell''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/01292008/gossip/pagesix/banned_by_babs_348303.htm|title=Banned by Babs|work=New York Post|date=January 29, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080130095921/http://www.nypost.com/seven/01292008/gossip/pagesix/banned_by_babs_348303.htm|archivedate=January 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While declining to discuss the ban on ''[[Access Hollywood]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesshollywood.com/article/8191/barbara-walters-re-bans-kathy-griffin-from-the-view|title=Barbara Walters Re-Bans Kathy Griffin From ''The View''|work=[[Access Hollywood]]|date=January 30, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080215114939/http://www.accesshollywood.com/article/8191/Barbara-Walters-Re-Bans-Kathy-Griffin-From-The-View|archivedate=February 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; during the filming of an episode for ''My Life on the D-List'' with former ''The View'' co-host/moderator [[Rosie O'Donnell]], Griffin did talk about the ban, specifically targeting ''The View'' executive producer [[Bill Geddie]]. Griffin had also been mentioned as a possible replacement for Walters when she departed the show.

As of August 2009, Griffin had been un-banned from ''The View'' and was a guest on September 18, 2009, and June 15, 2010. However, in an interview on ''The Talk'', Griffin has stated she has been re-banned from ''The View'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://daytimeconfidential.zap2it.com/2010/11/03/shots-fired-kathy-griffin-rips-elisabeth-hasselbeck-on-the-talk|title=Kathy Griffin Rips The View's Elisabeth Hasselbeck on The Talk!|first=Jillian|last=Bowe|work=[[Daytime Confidential]]|date=November 3, 2010|access-date=September 11, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325205959/http://daytimeconfidential.zap2it.com/2010/11/03/shots-fired-kathy-griffin-rips-elisabeth-hasselbeck-on-the-talk|archivedate=March 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to an argument with ''The View'' co-host [[Elisabeth Hasselbeck]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ca.eonline.com/news/marc_malkin/kathy_griffin_hasselbeck_lighten_up/191221|title=Kathy Griffin to Hasselbeck: Lighten Up or...Suck It!|first=Marc|last=Malkin|work=ca.eonline.com|date=July 20, 2010|access-date=September 11, 2011|archivedate=July 10, 2012|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120710144028/http://uk.eonline.com/news/191221/kathy-griffin-to-hasselbeck-lighten-up-or-suck-it|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Griffin has since been unbanned once again and has appeared several times on the show, including as a guest co-host.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

===Laugh Your Head Off World Tour 2017–2018===
In August 2017, Griffin announced a worldwide comedy tour. The title "Laugh Your Head Off" was a reference to her depiction of an effigy of U.S. President Donald Trump's severed head. The tour visited major cities in Singapore, Australia, Germany, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and many more European, and Asian cities. Several shows sold out within minutes of going on sale, leading to Griffin adding several shows to the lineup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etonline.com/kathy-griffin-announces-new-world-tour-called-laugh-your-head-following-donald-trump-controversy|title=Kathy Griffin Annouces World Tour|first=Elizabeth|last=Stanton|work=[[Entertainment Tonight]] |date=August 27, 2017|access-date=October 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She continued with a North America leg of the tour, commencing May 23, 2018, in [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]], Canada, and including both [[Radio City Music Hall]] and [[Carnegie Hall]] in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newsday.com/entertainment/celebrities/kathy-griffin-radio-city-1.17847480|title=Kathy Griffin adds Radio City tour stop after selling out Carnegie Hall date| first= Frank |last=Lovece|work=[[Newsday]]|location=Long Island/New York City|date=April 3, 2018 |accessdate=April 7, 2018|quote=...begins her North American leg in Ottawa, Ontario, on May 23.}}{{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.thewrap.com/kathy-griffin-in-shock-carnegie-hall-comeback-show-sold-out-one-day/|title=Kathy Griffin 'In Shock' Her Carnegie Hall Comeback Show Sold Out in One Day|first=Rosemary |last=Rossi|date= March 17, 2018 |accessdate= April 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
===Various talk shows bans===
Although some talk show hosts such as [[Craig Kilborn]], [[Bill Maher]] and [[Howard Stern]] (whom she credits with giving her a "straight fanbase") welcome her humor on their programs, Griffin said she was banned from appearing on several TV shows including ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'' and ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://teamcoco.com/video/kathy-griffin-barbara-walters|title=Kathy Griffin: Barbara Walters Will Cut A Bitch!|website=TeamCoco|language=en|access-date=May 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She got re-banned from ''The View'' because of a joke she made about Barbara Walters.

Nevertheless, E! purchased rights to air ''My Life on the D-List'' for its British channel, a fact she noted in an episode of season 3.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

===Emmy Awards controversy===
[[File:Griffin Turner McDonald.jpg|thumb|Griffin, [[Michael McDonald (comedian)|Michael McDonald]] and [[Karri Turner]] perform an improvisational skit for soldiers and airmen in [[Tikrit]], Iraq, March 17, 2006.]]
The second season of ''My Life on the D-List'', which premiered on June 6, 2006, earned Griffin the 2007 [[Primetime Emmy Award]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Reality Program|Outstanding Reality Program]], non-competition, on September 8, 2007. She received it during the [[Creative Arts Emmy Award]]s, which was hosted by [[Carlos Mencia]] and aired on [[E!]] on September 15. Griffin stirred up controversy with her acceptance speech, saying,

{{quote|Now, a lot of people come up here and thank [[Jesus]] for this award. I want you to know that no one had less to do with this award than Jesus. He didn't help me a bit. If it was up to him, [[Cesar Millan]] would be up here with that damn dog.

Griffin later explained that she meant this remark not as a slight on Jesus, but rather as a satire of celebrities who thank Jesus profusely and nonsensically for their awards, especially artists who themselves are controversial in their speech and actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbziBwi489Q|title=Larry King Live|date=September 17, 2007|access-date=September 19, 2007|publisher=YouTube|format=video|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307144609/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbziBwi489Q|archivedate=March 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Catholic League (U.S.)|Catholic League]] urged the academy to "denounce Griffin's obscene and [[blasphemy|blasphemous]] comment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.celebritymound.com/kathy-griffins-emmy-remarks-to-be-censored|title=Griffin's Emmy remarks to be censored|last=Elber|first=Lynn|date=September 11, 2007|access-date=September 11, 2007|publisher=CelebrityMound.com|agency=AP|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708131757/http://www.celebritymound.com/kathy-griffins-emmy-remarks-to-be-censored|archivedate=July 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Smoky Mountain Opry Theater|The Miracle Theater]] of [[Pigeon Forge, Tennessee]] printed out a full-page advertisement for [[USA Today]] which said, "Although others may choose to use their national platform to slander our God, we are honored as professional entertainers to stand for Christ."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Griffin scolded by Christian theater troupe|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/griffin-scolded-by-christian-theater-150643|accessdate=April 6, 2018|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=September 21, 2007|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Academy said that her "offensive remarks will not be part of the E! telecast on Saturday night".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,296382,00.html|title=Kathy Griffin's Emmy Remarks About Jesus to Be Censored|date=September 11, 2007|access-date=September 11, 2007|publisher=Fox News|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Griffin later responded, "Am I the only Catholic left with a sense of humor?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,22404898-23109,00.html|title='Offensive' Jesus remarks cut from Emmys|date=September 12, 2007|work=News.com.au|access-date=September 18, 2007|agency=Reuters|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013101310/http://news.com.au/story/0%2C23599%2C22404898-23109%2C00.html|archivedate=October 13, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Termination of appearance on ''Hannah Montana''====
Griffin said she was fired from an appearance on the show ''[[Hannah Montana]]'', on account of her Emmy acceptance speech. According to Griffin "the instructions literally came down, 'We don't want her anywhere near the building.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/daily/fashion/2008/03/kathy_griffin_gets_rejected_al.html|title=In Praise of Kathy Griffin|date=March 18, 2008|access-date=September 11, 2011|work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Griffin responded in her comedy act, joking that [[Miley Cyrus]] "...has been flashing her green bra and posing topless."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aoltv.com/2008/05/01/was-kathy-griffin-dumped-over-jesus-joke|title=Was Kathy Griffin dumped over Jesus joke?|last=Boursaw|first=Jane|date=May 1, 2008|access-date=September 11, 2011|work=AOL TV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Banning from Apollo Theater ===
In a July 2009 episode of ''My Life on the D-List'', after using profanity in an [[Natalie Suleman|Octomom]] joke during her routine at New York's [[Apollo Theater]], Griffin said that she received a letter banning her from the venue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://talkoffame.com/?p=1271|title=Kathy Griffin's Attempt To Win Over The Black Community|access-date=September 11, 2011|work=talkoffame.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130811230631/http://talkoffame.com/?p=1271|archivedate=August 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Depiction of President Trump===
On May 30, 2017, Griffin posted a video of herself holding "a mask styled to look like the severed, bloody head" of [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Donald Trump]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/31/arts/trump-kathy-griffin.html|title=CNN Fires Kathy Griffin From New Year's Eve Broadcast Over Trump Photo|first=Jonah Engel|last=Bromwich|date=May 31, 2017|work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=June 21, 2017|archivedate= June 21, 2017| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170621214210/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/31/arts/trump-kathy-griffin.html?_r=0|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was posted on her [[Instagram]] and [[Twitter]] accounts. She wrote: "I caption this 'there was blood coming out of his eyes, blood coming out of his...wherever," referencing a past comment Trump had made about [[Megyn Kelly]].

Various members of the Trump family responded to the photo, including Trump, his son [[Donald Trump Jr.|Donald Jr.]], and his wife [[Melania Trump|Melania]], who said, "As a mother, a wife, and a human being, that photo is very disturbing. When you consider some of the atrocities happening in the world today, a photo opportunity like this is simply wrong and makes you wonder about the mental health of the person who did it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mettler|first1=Katie|last2=Wootson Jr.|first2=Cleve R.|date=June 2, 2017|title='He broke me': A defiant, tearful Kathy Griffin slams attacks by Trump and his family |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/06/02/kathy-griffin-will-talk-about-bullying-from-the-trump-family-at-presser-friday|accessdate=June 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 2, 2017, an attorney for Griffin, [[Lisa Bloom]], stated, "Like many edgy works of artistic expression, the photo could be interpreted different ways. But Griffin never imagined that it could be misinterpreted as a threat of violence against Trump. That was never what she intended.

In May 2017, Griffin subsequently was dropped by [[Squatty Potty]] as a marketing spokesperson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Tim|last=Nudd|date=May 31, 2017|url=http://www.adweek.com/creativity/squatty-potty-drops-kathy-griffin-over-shock-photos-with-beheaded-trump|title=Squatty Potty Drops Kathy Griffin over Shock Photos with 'Beheaded' Trump|newspaper=Adweek|accessdate=May 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CNN said in a statement prior to announcing her termination, "We found what she did disgusting and offensive.

==Style of humor==
Griffin developed her love for [[popular culture]] through her immediate and extended family, who were frequently commenting about the latest news. She explained that "I may have been into ''[[The Brady Bunch]]'' like every other kid, but I also wanted to watch [[John Lennon]] and [[Yoko Ono]] on ''[[The Dick Cavett Show]]'', and every minute of the [[United States Senate Watergate Committee|Watergate hearings]]. It was
fear of the dinner table that got me hooked."&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{harvnb|Griffin|2010|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has also named her mother Maggie as influential in her consumption of pop culture, calling her "the ideal audience for the Hollywood dish". Griffin named the character of [[Rhoda Morgenstern]] of 1970s sitcom ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'' as an influence, saying,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{harvnb|Griffin|2010|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|[''The Mary Tyler Moore Show''] gave me the first inkling of what place I could have in the entertainment world.

That's when I fell in love with wanting to be the [[sidekick]]. Everything out of her mouth was hysterical, yet she was vulnerable and human. I remember my family fell in love with her, too.

While Griffin established her career with candid observations about everyday life and her dating experiences, later focusing on mainly mocking celebrities, her act currently consists of recounting embellished stories involving celebrities. Though her humor may be wicked, Griffin hopes people understand that no malice is intended by it. "I'm genuinely a fan of most of the people I trash in the act," said Griffin in an interview. "I really, really try and focus on making fun of people for their behavior. I'm not so into making fun of someone for the way they look, or something that's out of their control."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://suicidegirls.com/interviews/Kathy%20Griffin%3A%20My%20Life%20on%20the%20D%20List|title=Kathy Griffin: My Life on the D List|first=Nicole|last=Powers|work=SuicideGirls.com|date=May 25, 2009|access-date=May 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Griffin is sometimes the object of her own humor, particularly with regard to her D-list status. While Griffin paints herself as a Hollywood outsider, she has a group of close celebrity friends such as [[Rosie O'Donnell]], [[Joan Rivers]], [[Jerry Seinfeld]], [[Gloria Estefan]], [[Whoopi Goldberg]], [[Jennifer Coolidge]], [[Rachel True]], [[Larry David]], [[Ricky Gervais]], [[Anderson Cooper]], [[Cher]] and [[Lance Bass]]. Her longtime friendship with Bass was the catalyst for a feud between her and gossip blogger [[Perez Hilton]], in which Griffin expressed anger over Hilton's "[[outing]]" of Bass on his website, calling Hilton's attacks on Bass "mean" and "unfunny".&lt;ref name="HiltonFeud1"&gt;{{cite web|work=In Case You Didn't Know|url=http://icydk.com/2006/12/06/perez-hilton-visits-howard-stern|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012082323/http://icydk.com/2006/12/06/perez-hilton-visits-howard-stern|archivedate=October 12, 2007|title=Perez Hilton Visits Howard Stern|access-date=October 19, 2007|publisher=ICYDK}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HiltonFeud2"&gt;{{cite web|work=Celebrity Babylon|url=http://www.celebritybabylon.com/features/perez-and-kathy-griffin-make-nice|title=Perez and Kathy Griffin Make Nice|access-date=October 19, 2007|publisher=Celebrity Babylon|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228191953/http://www.celebritybabylon.com/features/perez-and-kathy-griffin-make-nice|archivedate=February 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hilton responded by saying that Griffin's anger was hypocritical, considering all of the gay jokes she makes about Clay Aiken in her stand-up routines.&lt;ref name="HiltonFeud1"/&gt; In 2007, Griffin commented on her aversion to making fun of celebrity friends by saying, "There's nothing I won't do, but on the other hand I'm full of shit because that changes. For example, you know Lance Bass from [[NSYNC|'N Sync]] and how he's gay now? All those years that I knew he was gay, he and I were friends, I would never say, 'Hey, by the way, did you know that Lance Bass is gay?'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=TV Guide |url=http://entertainment1.sympatico.msn.ca/Living+life+on+the+DList/TV_Guide/Interviews/Insider/Articles/070711_kathygriffin_AD.htm?isfa=1 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080601040145/http://entertainment1.sympatico.msn.ca/Living%2Blife%2Bon%2Bthe%2BDList/TV_Guide/Interviews/Insider/Articles/070711_kathygriffin_AD.htm?isfa=1|archivedate=June 1, 2008|title=Living Life on the D-List|first=Amber|last=Dowling|access-date=October 19, 2007|publisher=TV Guide|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Griffin and Hilton ended their feud after the death of Griffin's father, and Hilton appeared on an episode of her show in 2007.&lt;ref name="HiltonFeud2"/&gt;

Griffin dismissed these statements as false as Zajicek is still working for Griffin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realitytvworld.com/news/d-list-star-kathy-griffin-denies-assitant-jessica-zajicek-has-quit-7554.php|title=''D-List'' star Kathy Griffin denies assistant Jessica Zajicek has quit|first=Christopher|last=Rocchio|access-date=March 6, 2009|work=Reality TV World|date=July 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the season premiere of The D-List depicted that Zajicek was no longer working for Griffin; Griffin explained early in the episode that Zajicek "has decided to move on".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_H5KbxrQYg&amp;feature=channel_page|title=YouTube – Kathy Griffin – My Life on the D List – Episode 5x01 Part 1/5|format=video|work=Youtube|date=June 9, 2009|accessdate=January 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|Proposition 8]] ballot results, Griffin volunteered for the [[Los Angeles LGBT Center|Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Center]]'s "Vote for Equality" campaign, going door-to-door asking Los Angeles residents for their opinion of LGBT marriage rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=AKA William|url=http://www.akawilliam.com/kathy-griffin-goes-door-to-door-for-gay-rights|title=Kathy Griffin Goes Door-to-Door For Gay Rights|publisher=AKA William|date=April 10, 2009 |access-date=January 22, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114162749/http://www.akawilliam.com/kathy-griffin-goes-door-to-door-for-gay-rights|archivedate=January 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2010, Griffin helped organize a rally in Washington, D.C. to repeal "Don't ask, don't tell".

Griffin caused controversy when she confronted Republican Congresswoman [[Michele Bachmann]] over her views on homosexuality at the 2010 Radio and Television Correspondents' Association Dinner, while in town for her rally against DADT. According to Griffin, she asked Bachmann "were you born a bigot or did you grow into it", a reference to Bachmann's belief that homosexuality is strictly environmental.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLXJ_7I7uXI |title=When Kathy Griffin Met Michele Bachmann|website=Youtube |accessdate=June 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Griffin said Bachmann replied by saying, "That's a good question, I'll have to think about that."

In July 2007, rumors circulated that Griffin was dating [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] co-founder [[Steve Wozniak]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Collins |first=Michelle |title=VH1 Best Week Ever – Off The Market: Kathy Griffin Finds a New Man! |url=http://www.bestweekever.tv/2007/08/17/off-the-market-kathy-griffin-finds-a-new-man/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070820012223/http://www.bestweekever.tv/2007/08/17/off-the-market-kathy-griffin-finds-a-new-man/ |archivedate=August 20, 2007 | access-date=September 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; They attended the [[59th Primetime Emmy Awards|2007 Emmy Awards]] together, and speculation arose when the two were interviewed together on the red carpet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Apple Co-Founder Steve Wozniak Escorted Comedian Kathy Griffin &amp; Her Potty Mouth To The Emmy's |url=http://www.ceosmack.com/2007/09/18/apple-co-founder-steve-wozniak-escorted-comedian-kathy-griffin-her-potty-mouth-to-the-emmys/ |access-date=September 18, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217011722/http://www.ceosmack.com/2007/09/18/apple-co-founder-steve-wozniak-escorted-comedian-kathy-griffin-her-potty-mouth-to-the-emmys/ |archivedate=December 17, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On ''[[Tom Green's House Tonight]]'' on February 6, 2008, Griffin confirmed her relationship with Wozniak. When asked if she actually targeted Wozniak to make her ex-husband jealous, Griffin stated: "What better way to get back at my ex, who was a tech, than to marry the biggest techno-nerd in the Universe?" Wozniak and Griffin served as King and Queen of the Humane Society of Silicon Valley Fur Ball on April 5, 2008, in Santa Clara, California, and scenes for the fourth season of ''My Life on the D-List'' were taped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Dogs Night at the Fur Ball|url=http://www.santaclaraweekly.com/822.html|last=Sacks|first=Larry|date=April 9, 2008|access-date=April 25, 2008|work=Santa Clara Weekly|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531030358/http://www.santaclaraweekly.com/822.html|archivedate=May 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2008, it was confirmed that Griffin and Wozniak were no longer dating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|series=''Today Show''|serieslink=Today (U.S. TV program)|title=June 6, 2008|date=June 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 9, 2009, she attended the [[Teen Choice Awards]] with [[Levi Johnston]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediaite.com/online/sarah-palins-nightmare-kathy-griffin-levi-johnston-work-the-red-carpet|title=Sarah Palin's Nightmare?

In the interview, Griffin and Johnston joked that they were in a serious relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediaite.com/online/kathy-griffin-and-levi-johnsons-love-story-goes-late-night-on-larry-king|title=Kathy Griffin and Levi Johnston's Love Story Goes Late Night on Larry King|publisher=Mediaite|date=August 11, 2009|access-date=January 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 7, 2011, while appearing on ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'', Griffin announced that she was romantically involved with actor and former [[National Football League|NFL]] practice-squad player [[Isaiah Mustafa]]. Mustafa later stated that he was single, though he admitted to finding Griffin "amazing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Staff|url=http://www.okmagazine.com/2011/03/isaiah-mustafas-not-dating-kathy-griffin-i-am-a-single-man|title=Isaiah Mustafa's Not Dating Kathy Griffin: "I Am a Single Man"|publisher=OK!

In the same interview, she stated that the previous July, she had ended a private romantic relationship that had lasted four years with a man she did not publicly identify, only saying that he was "a regular guy with a regular job", and that it was a "messy breakup".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F14tClFS2hQ&amp;feature=related|title=Kathy Griffin|format=video|publisher=YouTube|access-date=January 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later revealed that the man was Tom Vize.
