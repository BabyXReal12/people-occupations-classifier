'''Timothy Meadows''' (born February 5, 1961) is an [[United States|American]] actor and comedian and one of the longest-running cast members on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', where he appeared for ten seasons.

==Early life and education==
Meadows was born in [[Highland Park, Michigan]], the son of Mardell, a nurse's assistant, and Lathon Meadows, a [[janitor]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmreference.com/film/36/Tim-Meadows.html Tim Meadows Biography (1961—)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; He studied television and radio broadcasting at [[Wayne State University]].&lt;ref name=APA&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apa-agency.com/comedy/Tim_Meadows.aspx |title=Tim Meadows' biography on the APA talent and literary agency's website |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=apa-agency.com |publisher= |access-date= |quote= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723192842/http://www.apa-agency.com/comedy/Tim_Meadows.aspx |archivedate=2011-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Meadows began performing improvisational comedy at the Soup Kitchen Saloon.&lt;ref name=APA/&gt; Meadows' start in show business was in Chicago as a member of [[The Second City]] comedy troupe alongside future star [[Chris Farley]]. In 1991, Meadows landed a spot on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' and would go on to become a longtime cast member, appearing on the program until 2000. (Meadows was on the show for ten seasons; this was the record for the longest tenure on the show until it was surpassed by [[Darrell Hammond]] in 2005, whose record was also surpassed by [[Kenan Thompson]] in 2017.) Meadows' lengthy tenure on the show was used as a gag in three monologues when former cast members [[Phil Hartman]] and [[Mike Myers (actor)|Mike Myers]] returned to the show to host, and when [[Alec Baldwin]] hosted for his twelfth time.

Meadows often spoofed famous personalities including [[O. J. Simpson]], [[Michael Jackson]], [[Tiger Woods]], [[Oprah Winfrey]] and [[Erykah Badu]] on SNL, and one time remarked that he had no character that was identified to him, such as [[Wayne and Garth]] being identified to Mike Myers and [[Dana Carvey]].{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Eventually he did get an original character with Leon Phelps, "The Ladies' Man", a perpetually [[sexual arousal|horny]] [[talk show]] host who falsely believed himself to be the living definition of what women search for in a man. The character was adapted into a 2000 film, ''[[The Ladies Man (2000 film)|The Ladies Man]]'', which followed the character's attempts to find love and a suitable outlet for his beloved radio program. In 2001, he co-starred in ''[[Three Days (2001)]]''; in 2003 he appeared as Miles McDermott in ''[[The Even Stevens Movie]]''.

Meadows soon moved on to other projects, including a regular role on the short-lived [[NBC]] sitcom ''[[The Michael Richards Show]]'' and a supporting role in the 2004 film ''[[The Cookout]]''. He also guest starred as a client on the hit NBC comedy ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]'' in the second-season episode "[[The Client (The Office)|The Client]]". He played a high school principal in ''[[Mean Girls]]'', a film written by (and co-starring) fellow ''SNL'' cast member [[Tina Fey]]. He also had a part in [[Handsome Boy Modeling School]]'s album ''[[White People (album)|White People]]''. In 2007, he appeared in a substantial supporting role in ''[[Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story]]''.

Meadows has appeared in other feature films, including ''[[Coneheads (film)|Coneheads]]'', ''It's Pat'', and ''[[Wayne's World 2]]'', all of which were based on popular ''SNL'' characters and had varying degrees of success. Most recently he was in the 2006 film ''[[The Benchwarmers]]'' alongside his former ''SNL'' co-stars [[Rob Schneider]] and [[David Spade]]. He was also featured in CBS's ''[[Gameshow Marathon (US TV series)|Gameshow Marathon]]'' (summer 2006), has appeared on ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' in the recurring role of [[P.K. Winsome]], a conservative pundit and entrepreneur (who made an appearance at the [[Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear]]), and starred in ''[[The Bill Engvall Show]]''. He was also a frequent guest on ''[[The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson]]'' as a comic field reporter. On May 31, 2008, Meadows threw out a ceremonial first pitch and conducted the seventh-inning stretch at [[Wrigley Field]] during a [[Chicago Cubs]] game against the Colorado Rockies.

In 2014, Meadows co-starred alongside [[Casey Wilson]] and [[Ken Marino]] in the short-lived [[NBC]] sitcom ''[[Marry Me (U.S. TV series)|Marry Me]]''. He and [[Dan Bucatinsky]] played "The Kevins", the gay dads of Annie (played by Wilson) who are both named Kevin.  Since 2013, he has appeared in a recurring role on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] sitcom ''[[The Goldbergs (2013 TV series)|The Goldbergs]]'', playing Mr. Glascott, the high school's parrot-owning guidance counselor.  In 2016, he began starring in the [[FOX]] live-action/animation hybrid ''[[Son of Zorn]]'' opposite [[Cheryl Hines]] and [[Jason Sudeikis]]. He also had a recurring role in [[Brooklyn Nine-Nine]] as Jake Peralta's prison roommate.

Meadows continues to perform improv in [[Chicago]] and [[Los Angeles]], most frequently at venues such as the [[ImprovOlympic]] and [[Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ioimprov.com ImprovOlympic]&lt;/ref&gt; With [[Heather Anne Campbell]] and [[Miles Stroth]], Meadows frequently performed in the improvised sketch show, ''Heather, Miles, and Tim'' in [[Los Angeles]].

==Personal life==
From July 1997 to 2005, Meadows was married to Michelle Taylor, with whom he has two children.{{cn|date=May 2018}}
