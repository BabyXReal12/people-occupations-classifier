'''Earl Okin''' (born 31 January 1947) is a [[London]]-based [[singer-songwriter]],&lt;ref name="Up Close"&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://hk-magazine.com/events/article/upclose-earl-okin | title=Upclose with Earl Okin | work=HK magazine | location= Hong Kong|date=20 April 2006 | accessdate=15 January 2014 | author=Stokes, Natasha}}&lt;/ref&gt; musician and comedian.

Born in [[Carshalton]], [[Surrey]], he has lived in [[Notting Hill]] since he was five years old, holds a degree in [[philosophy]] from the [[University of Kent at Canterbury]] (1968) and worked as a [[schoolmaster]] for 11 years before going full-time.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

He recorded his first single at [[Abbey Road Studios|Abbey Road]] in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.basca.org.uk/members-directory/earlokin/ BASCA Directory.] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130423194729/http://www.basca.org.uk/members-directory/earlokin/ |date=23 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.londonisfunny.com/features/29584/Early_bloomer_Earl_Okin_reveals_1967_single_'Yellow_Petals' "Early bloomer Earl Okin reveals 1967 single 'Yellow Petals'", London Is Funny, 13 September 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt; Some of his songs were covered during the 1960s by [[Cilla Black]], [[Georgie Fame]] and [[Helen Shapiro]], the latter recording now popular within the world of [[Northern Soul]].

During the 1970s, Okin started to perform as support act in large venues, beginning with [[Folk music|folk]] acts such as [[Ralph McTell]] and [[Fairport Convention]], he progressed to open for such varied performers as [[Jean-Luc Ponty]] and [[Van Morrison]]. However, it was the 1979 tour with [[Paul McCartney and Wings]] which prompted him to pursue his musical career full-time. He also began to perform in [[List of jazz festivals|jazz festivals]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

In 1981, he appeared on ''[[Parkinson (show)|The Parkinson Show]]'' and was invited by [[Nigel Planer]] to perform at [[The Comic Strip]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} This led to his second career on the "[[alternative comedy]]" circuit where he remains a headline act. However, his act continues to be primarily musical. He has never performed stand-up. Fans favourite comedy songs of his are "Mango", "Bessie" and "My Room". 

In 1983, he began to perform at the [[Edinburgh Fringe]] where he has since performed over 500 shows.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Okin continues to work as a songwriter and jazz singer/musician, with a particular interest in [[Bossa Nova]]. He gives concerts in [[Brazil]] from time to time, as well as touring his one-man show, a mixture of music and comedy, worldwide. He has performed in New York at [[Birdland (jazz club)|Birdland]], [[Apollo Theater|The Apollo]] and other jazz venues, but, not forgetting his comedy side, also at [[Carolines on Broadway|Caroline's]]. In addition he toured India, Singapore, and other nearby countries. He has also performed at most major venues in London, including the [[Royal Albert Hall]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royalalberthall.com/tickets/events/2015/late-night-jazz-earl-okin/ "Late Night Jazz — Earl Okin"], Royal Albert Hall, 29 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Royal Festival Hall]], [[London Palladium|The Palladium]] and [[Wembley Arena]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comedycarnival.co.uk/comedians/Earl-Okin.html "Earl Okin – Sex Symbol and Musical Genius"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130212024057/http://www.comedycarnival.co.uk/comedians/Earl-Okin.html |date=12 February 2013 }}, Comedy Carnival.&lt;/ref&gt;

Okin has performed on TV in several countries, including Brazil, [[Australia]] and [[Germany]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Apart from self-published [[LP record|LP]]s, he has had CDs issued by the [[Bertelsmann Music Group]] in Germany and [[Austria]], and [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony]] in the UK.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}
He is currently unsigned, but has completed two CDs, one of Jazz and Bossa Nova, ''Bossa Britanica'' and, more recently a CD of his songs in various genres called, after the recording studio, ''Songs From A Garden Shed'' and a similarly named follow-up album.

He is also very much a part of the recent rebirth of interest in the modern take on [[variety show]]s.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

In 2012-3, Okin completed his autobiography, ''Earl's Caught'', and a musical (in conjunction with Jackie Skarvellis), called ''A Harlem Story''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

2017 is the year when the biographical documentary ''Who is Earl Okin?'' was presented in festivals and selected theaters.
