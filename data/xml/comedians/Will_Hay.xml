[[file:Will-Hay.jpg|thumb|Hay in ''[[The Ghost of St. Michael's]]'' (1941)]]

'''William Thomson Hay''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|size=100%|FRAS}} (6 December 1888 – 18 April 1949) was an English comedian, actor, author, film director and amateur astronomer who came to notice for his theatrical sketch as a jocular schoolmaster, known as Dr. Muffin.  The acts in which Hay performed the schoolmaster sketch became known as "The Fourth Form at St. Michael's". Hay toured with the act and appeared in the United States, Canada, Australia and South Africa. He famously performed the schoolmaster routine at the 1925 Royal Command Performance before [[George V of England|King George V]] and [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ajhw.co.uk/books/book136/book136.html |title=The Fourth Form At St. Michaels Will Hay &amp; His Scholars |website=A.J.H. Computer Services |accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
From 1934 to 1943, he was a prolific film star in Britain, and was ranked the third highest grossing star at the British Box Office in 1938, behind [[George Formby]] and [[Gracie Fields]].

Hay worked with [[Gainsborough Pictures]] from 1935 to 1940, during which time he developed a partnership with [[Graham Moffatt]], an insolent overweight schoolboy, and [[Moore Marriott]], a toothless old man. Hay's 1937 film, with Moffatt and Marriott, ''[[Oh, Mr. Porter!]]'' was credited by ''[[The Times]]'' as being "a comic masterpiece of the British cinema",&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'' 16 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt; while the writer, [[Jimmy Perry]], cited the film as an influence for developing the key characters in ''[[Dad's Army]]''.&lt;ref name="jimmyperry"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/jimmy-perry-obituary-creator-of-much-loved-sitcom-dads-army-a7377946.html |title=Jimmy Perry obituary: Creator of Dad's Army who used his own life experiences in much-loved sitcom |publisher=The Independent |date=24 October 2016 |accessdate=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hay often portrayed  incompetent authority figures who attempted to conceal their incompetence but whose true traits were exposed by those around him. As well as being incompetent, his characters are often immoral, such as his portrayal of a vicar involved in horse betting in ''[[Dandy Dick]]'', a fraudster who lies about his career as a distinguished sea captain in ''[[Windbag the Sailor]]'' and a prison warden, [[Dr Benjamin Twist]], in ''[[Convict 99]]'' who obtains his job by false pretenses.&lt;ref name="bbc3essay"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b05qdw88 |title=The Essay, British Film Comedians: Will Hay |publisher=BBC Radio 3 |date=13 April 2015 |accessdate=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is often compared to [[W. C. Fields]], who portrayed characters similar to that of Hay, often being misanthropic, self-centered scoundrels who still remained sympathetic despite their characteristics.&lt;ref name="lostmaster"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/4270299/Will-Hay-the-lost-master-of-British-comedy.html |title=Will Hay: the lost master of British comedy |publisher=The Daily Telegraph |date=16 January 2009 |accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hay was also an amateur astronomer, and in 1933 gained fame for discovering a [[Great White Spot]] on [[Saturn]]. He built his own observatory, and was a Fellow of the [[Royal Astronomical Society]].

==Early life==
Hay was born at 23 Durham Street in [[Stockton-on-Tees]], [[County Durham]], England, to William Robert Hay (1851–1920) and his wife, Elizabeth (1859–1910) (née Ebden). Hay had a brother and three sisters. When Hay was less than a year old the family moved to [[Suffolk]].&lt;ref&gt;1891 UK census: RG12/1494 f.56 p.47 &amp; p.48 – 192 Clapham Road, [[Lowestoft]], Suffolk&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;GRO Register of Births: MAR 1889 10a 49 STOCKTON – William Thomson Hay&lt;/ref&gt; William Hay Snr's career as an engineer required the family to move frequently; firstly to [[Hemel Hempstead]]; then to London; and finally to [[Manchester]], where his father established an engineering company.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} By his late teens, Hay Jnr. had become fluent in Italian, French and German and secured employment as an interpreter.&lt;ref name="reglegend1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/05/25/feature_will_hay_british_comedy_legend/ |title=Will Hay: Britain's bumbling star of the screen and skies. Page 1. |publisher=[[The Register]] |date=25 May 2015 |accessdate=6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===Early career===
Hay decided to become an actor when he was 21 after watching [[W. C. Fields]] perform a juggling act in [[Manchester]]. In the late 1800s Hay experienced some moderate success as a stand-up comedian and an after dinner speaker.&lt;ref name="stocktoncouncil"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.stockton.gov.uk/arts-culture-and-leisure/heritage/stockton-hall-of-fame/will-hay/ |title=Will Hay |publisher=Stockton-on-Tees Borough Council |accessdate=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hay's first contract came when he was offered a contract to perform at a theatre in [[Belper]].&lt;ref name="stocktoncouncil"/&gt; He first performed his schoolmaster character in 1910 which he based upon a colleague of his sister, who was a teaching mistress.&lt;ref name="reglegend1"/&gt; The characterisation was initially  performed in drag as a schoolmistress, but he transferred the character to a headmaster.&lt;ref name="bbc1976"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a67M2nouJfA |title=Will Hay – Master of Comedy |website=YouTube |publisher=BBC Radio 4 |date=2 June 1976 |accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1914 Hay began working with the impresario [[Fred Karno]] who had previously helped [[Stan Laurel]] and [[Charlie Chaplin]] achieve success.  Hay worked with Karno for four years.&lt;ref name="stocktoncouncil"/&gt;

Hay's schoolmaster sketches were known as "the fourth form at St Michaels" and were popular in the 1920s with which he toured in various countries over the world. Hay enjoyed particular success in countries such as South Africa, Canada and the USA. His wife, Gladys, often portrayed the part of the schoolboy or the character Harbottle in his sketches, the Harbottle character was one of the most popular characters in Hay's act, the character was that of a dim-witted, nearly deaf old man who was still in school because he was backward.&lt;ref name="bbc1976"/&gt; The character was later featured in Hay's films, being portrayed by [[Moore Marriott]]. In a 1976 interview, [[Val Guest]] who served as a screenwriter for many of Hay's films, stated he transferred the character of Harbottle into everyday situations.&lt;ref name="bbc1976"/&gt;

Hay performed the schoolmaster routine at the 1925 Royal Command Performance before [[George V of England|King George V]] and [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ajhw.co.uk/books/book136/book136.html |title=The Fourth Form At St. Michaels Will Hay &amp; His Scholars |website=A.J.H. Computer Services |accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hay published a magazine piece entitled ''Philosophy of laughter'' in which he discussed the psychology of comedy. In the essay, he stated "Why does every one of us laugh at seeing somebody else slapped in the face with a large piece of cold custard pie? Is it because we're all naturally cruel? Or is it because there's something inherently funny in custard pies? Or in faces? Or in throwing things? No. No. and no! The real reason why we laugh is because we are relieved. Because we are released from a sense of fear. Wherever we may happen to be – in the cinema, theatre, or music-hall – we tend to identify with the actors we are watching. So that when a custard pie is thrown we fear for a moment that it as been thrown at us. And then, immediately we realise that it hasn't hit us, we experience a feeling of relief, and we laugh".&lt;ref name="reglegend2"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/05/25/feature_will_hay_british_comedy_legend/?page=2 |title=Will Hay: Britain's bumbling star of the screen and skies. Page 2. |publisher=[[The Register]] |date=25 May 2015 |accessdate=6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elstree Studios===
Hay had become interested in film making while touring in the United States in the 1920s; however, at the time he doubted he had a future in this field. Having returned to England, Hay started work at [[Elstree Studios]] in 1934 where he made three films, ''[[Those Were the Days (1934 film)|Those Were the Days]]'', ''[[Radio Parade of 1935]]'' and ''[[Dandy Dick]]''.&lt;ref name="bbc1976"/&gt;

===Gainsborough pictures===
His time spent at Gainsborough was his most successful period, it was during this time he became one of the most prolific film stars in Britain. On three occasions, British film exhibitors voted him among the top ten stars at the British box office via annual poll in the Motion Picture Herald. He was ranked 8th in 1936, 4th in 1937 and 3rd in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article25390774 |title=PICTURES and PERSONALITIES. |newspaper=[[The Mercury (Hobart)|The Mercury]] |location=Hobart, Tas. |date=10 April 1937 |accessdate=27 April 2012 |page=5 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His first film for the film studio was ''[[Boys Will Be Boys (film)|Boys Will Be Boys]]'', in which the screenplay was written by Hay himself, the film's satirical approach towards the public school system was loosely based on the humor of the ''[[Daily Express]]'' columnist, [[Beachcomber (pen name)|Beachcomber]]. The film was widely regarded as one of the most subversive of its time due to the satire towards how authority is portrayed in the film, and was granted an A (adult) certificate by the [[British Board of Film Classification]].&lt;ref name="bbc3essay"/&gt; ''Boys Will Be Boys'' is widely regarded as Hay's break-out film. Writing for ''[[The Spectator]]'', [[Graham Greene]] characterised the film as "very amusing", describing Hay's portrayal of Dr. Smart as "competent" and praised [[Claude Dampier]]'s portrayal of Second Master Finch (Hay's adversary) as the film's "finest performance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Greene|first= Graham|authorlink= Graham Greene|date= 23 August 1935|title= Where's George?/The Great God Gold/Boys Will Be Boys/The Murder Man|url= |journal= [[The Spectator]]}} (reprinted in: {{cite book |editor1-last= John Russel|editor1-first= Taylor |date= 1980|title= The Pleasure Dome|url= |location= |publisher= |page= 16|isbn=0192812866}})&lt;/ref&gt; Several years later, the ''[[Radio Times]] Guide to Films'' gave ''Boys Will Be Boys'' three stars out of five, observing that the film contains "the blend of bluster and dishonesty that makes his films irresistible".&lt;ref&gt;''Radio Times Guide to Films'' (2004). p.187&lt;/ref&gt;

During his time with Gainsborough he worked with [[Marcel Varnel]], [[Val Guest]], [[Charles Hawtrey (actor born 1914)|Charles Hawtrey]], [[Marriott Edgar]] as well as [[Moore Marriott]] and [[Graham Moffatt]] who acted as Hay's straight men in a number of his films, Moffatt portrayed an overweight, insolent schoolboy reminiscent of Billy Bunter who was cast as Albert Brown and Marriott, as that of a toothless old man cast as Harbottle, Harbottle was originally a character in Hay's St. Michael's sketches. Together, the trio appeared in six films together between 1936 and 1940, ''[[Windbag the Sailor]]'', ''[[Oh, Mr. Porter!]]'', ''[[Convict 99]]'', ''[[Old Bones of the River]]'', ''[[Ask a Policeman]]'' and ''[[Where's That Fire?]]''.

Hay's 1937 film alongside Moffatt and Marriott, ''[[Oh, Mr. Porter!]]'' is often considered to be one of the greatest [[British comedy films]] of all-time. The [[British Film Institute]] included the film in its 360 Classic Feature Films list;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/aaronbcaldwell/dimbfi.html |title=Top 100 Movie Lists – BFI's 360 Classic Feature Films |accessdate=16 March 2007 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027094228/http://www.geocities.com/aaronbcaldwell/dimbfi.html |archivedate=27 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine described the movie as "amusing, if over-long", noting that there was "&lt;nowiki&gt;[n]&lt;/nowiki&gt;o love interest to mar the comedy";&lt;ref name=variety&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the cult website [[TV Cream]] listed it at number 41 in its list of cinema's Top 100 Films.&lt;ref name="tvcream"&gt;[http://www.tv.cream.org/extras/top100films/topfilms5041.htm TV Cream's Top 100 Films]&lt;/ref&gt; The director Marcel Varnel considered the film as among his best work,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''So You Want To Be In Pictures: The Autobiography of Val Guest''&lt;/ref&gt; and it was described in 2006, by ''[[The Times]]'' in its obituary for writer [[Val Guest]], as "a comic masterpiece of the British cinema".&lt;ref name="The Times, 16 May 2006"&gt;The Times, 16 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jimmy Perry]], in his autobiography, wrote that the [[triumvirate]] of [[Captain Mainwaring]], [[Corporal Jones]] and [[Private Pike]] in ''[[Dad's Army]]'' was inspired by watching ''Oh, Mr Porter''.&lt;ref&gt;James Perry, ''A Stupid Boy'' (2002), p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; 

Both Moffatt and Marriott were absent from Hay's 1938 film, ''[[Hey! Hey! USA]]'' with American comedy actor [[Edgar Kennedy]] being cast as Hay's sidekick instead, the film was a somewhat unsuccessful attempt to crack the American market.&lt;ref name="reglegend3"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/05/25/feature_will_hay_british_comedy_legend/?page=3 |title=Will Hay: Britain's bumbling star of the screen and skies. Page 3. |work=[[The Register]] |date=25 May 2015 |accessdate=6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many of his films, Hay wore a wig, which made it appear as if he was balding.&lt;ref name="lostmaster"/&gt;

Hay decided to break up the partnership with Moffatt and Marriott after their 1940 film ''[[Where's That Fire?]]'' due to his concern that their act was becoming repetitive.&lt;ref name="lostmaster"/&gt;  Hay was known to dislike working with Moffatt and Marriott, describing his partnership with them as "a three legged stool." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britishpictures.com/stars/Marriott_Moore.htm |title=Moore Marriott (1885 - 1949) |publisher=British Pictures |accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had also expressed concern that [[Moore Marriott]] who portrayed Harbottle gained a bigger reaction from audiences than he did.&lt;ref name="lostmaster"/&gt; He had been seeking to break up their partnership in the years prior, it was only due to his film ''[[Hey! Hey! USA]]'' being somewhat unsuccessful that the writers and producers successfully talked him into bringing Moffatt and Marriott back.&lt;ref name="stocktoncouncil"/&gt;

===Ealing Studios===
Hay left Gainsborough and began working with Ealing in 1940, this was in an attempt for him to break up his partnership with [[Graham Moffatt]] and [[Moore Marriott]] who Hay had long expressed his dissatisfaction at being associated with.&lt;ref name="bbc3essay"/&gt; [[Claude Hulbert]] and [[Charles Hawtrey (actor born 1914)|Charles Hawtrey]] acted as Hay's sidekick in his first film for Ealing, ''[[The Ghost of St Michael's]]'' (1941). Both would return to act with Hay in respective films, Hawtrey in ''[[The Goose Steps Out]]'' (1942) and Hulbert in Hay's final film, ''[[My Learned Friend]]'' (1943). [[John Mills]], who had appeared in Hay's first film, ''[[Those Were the Days (1934 film)|Those Were the Days]]'' returned to act as his sidekick in ''[[The Black Sheep of Whitehall]]''. ''[[The Goose Steps Out]]'' (1942) for Ealing was an effective piece of anti-[[Nazism|Nazi]] [[slapstick]], in the film, Hay acts as a British spy posing as a Nazi official and teaches Nazi students about British customs. When lecturing them on this topic, he tells the students that the [[V sign]] (often used in Britain as an insult) is a mark of respect, and instructs the class to make a synchronized V sign to a portrait of [[Adolf Hitler]]. This scene is often considered one of the most iconic from a [[British comedy films|British comedy film]].&lt;ref name="bbc3essay"/&gt; During Hay's tenure with Ealing he was credited as a director in three of his films, ''[[The Black Sheep of Whitehall]]'', ''[[The Goose Steps Out]]'' and ''[[My Learned Friend]]''. In all three, he co-directed with [[Basil Dearden]]. In 1942, he starred in a short information film, ''[[Go to Blazes (1942 film)|Go to Blazes]]'' alongside [[Thora Hird]] and [[Muriel George]]. The film was set during [[the Blitz]] and his role was a dim-witted father who tried unsuccessfully to defuse a bomb which had landed near his house, the bomb is only defused through the help of his daughter, portrayed by Hird.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/1423872/index.html |title=Go to Blazes (1942) |publisher=BFI Screen Online |accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1942, he made an appearance in the [[propaganda film]], ''[[The Big Blockade]]'' among other prolific actors of the time, including [[Leslie Banks]], [[John Mills]] and [[Michael Redgrave]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6f4b2339 |title=The Big Blockade (1942) |publisher=The British Film Institute |accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His final film, ''[[My Learned Friend]]'' in 1943 has been described as a masterpiece of black comedy and has been cited as paving the way for the future [[Ealing comedies|Ealing comedy films]] ''[[Kind Hearts and Coronets]]'' (1949) and ''[[The Ladykillers]]'' (1955).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/news/will-hays-new-direction-my-learned-friend |title=Will Hay's new direction: My Learned Friend |publisher=The British Film Institute |date=1 June 2015 |accessdate=11 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to ailing health, ''My Learned Friend'' was Hay's final film.&lt;ref name="lostmaster"/&gt; The plot of the film was Hay in the role of an incompetent barrister being haunted by a serial killer and an ex-client (Mervyn Johns) who seeks to kill him.

Hay was scheduled to star in another film for Ealing in 1943, ''Bob's your uncle'', however his diagnosis of cancer prevented him from proceeding.&lt;ref name="bbc3essay"/&gt;

Hay's tenure with Ealing was a box office success and his films were critically acclaimed, but not as funny as those made at Gainsborough with Moffatt and Marriott.&lt;ref name="bbc1976"/&gt;

===Radio career===
The half-hour weekly Will Hay Programme began in August 1944, and was broadcast live from the [[BBC Paris Theatre]] in Lower Regent Street. The series lasted for four months and was canceled due to Hay's dispute with the [[BBC]] over the quality of the scripts. Just before Christmas, the show went live at the [[Victoria Palace Theatre|Victoria Palace]] for six weeks.
The sketch was performed one more time, on 4 May 1945 (4 days before VE Day) before the Royal Family and many military notables. This was at a private function at the [[Life Guards (British Army)|Life Guards]] barracks in [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]]. It was not publicized in the newspapers due to security concerns. Hay's character during his radio series was called Dr. Muffin, a name chosen so that the students could mock him with the name "Old Crumpet."&lt;ref name="howtickled"&gt;{{cite web url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b007m5v6 |title=How Tickled Am I? Series 2 Episode 6 — Will Hay |publisher=[[BBC Radio 7]] |date=2008 |accessdate=6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Astronomy==
Aside from his [[day job]] as a comedian, Hay was a dedicated and respected amateur [[astronomer]]. He constructed a personal observatory in his garden in [[Mill Hill]] and built a [[glider (aircraft)|glider]] in 1909.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} He became a Fellow of the [[Royal Astronomical Society]] in 1932 and is noted for having discovered a [[Great White Spot]] on the planet [[Saturn]] in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://cdsads.u-strasbg.fr//full/seri/MNRAS/0094//0000085.000.html |title=The spot on Saturn |journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society |volume=94 |year=1933 |page=85 |last=Hay |first=W.T. |accessdate=11 May 2017|bibcode = 1933MNRAS..94...85H |doi = 10.1093/mnras/94.1.85 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The spot lasted for a few months and then faded away. He also measured the positions of [[comet]]s with a [[micrometer]] he built himself, and designed and built a [[blink comparator]]. He wrote the book ''Through My Telescope'' in 1935, which had a foreword by [[Sir Richard Gregory, 1st Baronet|Sir Richard Gregory]], formerly Emeritus Professor of Astronomy at Queen's College, London. Hay kept his career in astronomy separate from his comedy career, he published his school ''Through My Telescope'' under the name of W.T. Hay and used the same title when giving lectures on astronomy.&lt;ref name="bbc1976"/&gt; Hay was an advocate for education on astronomy and considered those who had an interest in astronomy "the only men who see life in its true proportion." In a 1933 interview with the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' he stated "If we were all astronomers, there'd be no more war."&lt;ref name="mobberley"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/2009JBAA..119...67M |title=Will Hay (1888-1949) and his telescopes |first1=Martin P. |last1=Mobberley |first2=Kenneth J. |last2=Goward |journal=Journal of the British Astronomical Association |volume=119| issue = 2 |pages=67–81 |year=April 2009 |accessdate=11 May 2017|bibcode = 2009JBAA..119...67M }}&lt;!-- Also available here http://martinmobberley.co.uk/WillHay.html --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He was a friend of [[William Herbert Steavenson]], who would go on to become the [[President of the Royal Astronomical Society]] in 1957.&lt;ref name="mobberley"/&gt; When Hay died, a few items of his equipment were bequeathed to the [[British Astronomical Association]].{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

Hay has an asteroid named in his honor, Asteroid 3125 Hay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RbDkCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT162&amp;lpg=PT162&amp;dq=asteroid+named+after+will+hay&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=7GOThEjZZL&amp;sig=hG1m7opBxu6LcAEsm8WrVWwCq8A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiDidmUgM3TAhULKcAKHfL5DBMQ6AEILjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=asteroid%20named%20after%20will%20hay&amp;f=false |title=Asteroids: A History |publisher=Smithsonian Institution |date=26 April 2016 |first=Curtis |last=Peebles |isbn=9781944466046 |accessdate=11 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life, health issues and death==
Hay married Gladys Perkins (1889–1982) in 1907,&lt;ref&gt;GRO Register of Marriages: DEC 1907 8d 287 SALFORD – William Thomson Hay = Gladys Perkins&lt;/ref&gt; whom he had known since he was 15,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Biographical Encyclopedia of Astronomers |last=Hockey |first=Thomas |year=2009 |publisher=[[Springer Publishing]] |isbn=978-0-387-31022-0 |accessdate=22 August 2012 |url=http://www.springerreference.com/docs/html/chapterdbid/58592.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; but legally separated on 18 November 1935, however they never divorced. Gladys cited the reason for this as she was a Roman Catholic.&lt;ref name="stocktoncouncil"/&gt; They had two daughters and a son: Gladys Elspeth Hay (1909–1979), William Edward Hay (1913–1995)&lt;ref&gt;GRO Register of Births: SEP 1913 8d 120 SALFORD – William E. Hay&lt;/ref&gt; and Joan A. Hay (1917–1975).&lt;ref&gt;GRO Register of Births: SEP 1917 8d 64 SALFORD – Joan A. Hay&lt;/ref&gt; Following his separation from Gladys in 1935, he was in a long-term relationship with Randi Kopstadt, a native of Norway.&lt;ref name="stocktoncouncil"/&gt;

Off-screen, Hay was described as being a very serious and private man, and some thought he may have had a dark side due to his demeanour.&lt;ref name="bbc3essay"/&gt; [[Peter Ustinov]], who made his film debut in [[The Goose Steps Out]] as a straight man to Hay, said in a 1990 interview when asked about working with him "Well, Will Hay wasn't very funny but I found that very few comics are." as well as "And Will Hay was always wrapped in a blanket at certain hours and had his tea, and we all stopped talking while he was having his tea, and then we went on shooting. I don't remember him saying anything memorable, nothing I could remember at all. He was very funny when you saw him on the screen, but in life all those people are very, very strange."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/audio/id/1124365/ |title=Peter Ustinov: The Guardian Interview |publisher=BFI Screen Online |date=7 April 1990 |accessdate=11 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1931, Hay was King Rat of the [[Grand Order of Water Rats]]. Hay made his final public appearance at a convention by the organization on 15 April 1949.&lt;ref name="stocktoncouncil"/&gt;

Hay was a passionate aviator, and gave flying lessons to [[Amy Johnson]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/humber/content/articles/2005/10/18/amy_johnson_feature.shtml "Local history: Amy Johnson]", BBC Humberside, 24 September 2014, accessed 2 July 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946 while on holiday, Hay suffered a stroke which left the right side of his body crippled and also affected his speech, Hay was told by his doctors that he would in all likelihood only make a partial recovery.&lt;ref name="stocktoncouncil"/&gt; Following his stroke, he spent time in [[South Africa]] on the advice of his doctors, because of the climate.&lt;ref name="bbc1976"/&gt; However, his health had improved slightly by the following year when Hay had plans to become a film producer. However, in 1947, his friend [[Marcel Varnel]], who had directed many of Hay's films, died in a car accident, and Hay postponed his plans.&lt;ref name="stocktoncouncil"/&gt;

Hay died at his flat in [[Chelsea, London]] after a further stroke on 18 April 1949 and is buried in [[Streatham Park Cemetery]], London.&lt;ref&gt;GRO Register of Deaths: JUN 1949 5c 251 CHELSEA – William T. Hay, aged 60&lt;/ref&gt; He had made his last public appearance on Good Friday 1949, just three days earlier, those who were present at Hay's final appearance described him as showing no sign of illness and said he had discussed his plans for the future.&lt;ref name="stocktoncouncil"/&gt;

==Influences==
Comedians who have cited Hay as an influence include [[Ken Dodd]],&lt;ref name="tomahawk"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tomahawkpress.com/will-hay/ |title=Will Hay |first=Graham |last=Rinaldi |publisher=Tomahawk Press |year=2009 |isbn=9780955767012 |accessdate=11 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eric Morecambe]], [[Tommy Cooper]], [[Harry Worth]],&lt;ref name="reglegend3"/&gt; [[Harry Enfield]], [[Jimmy Perry]] and [[David Croft (TV producer)|David Croft]].&lt;ref name="jimmyperry"/&gt; Hay was also an influence on [[Tony Hancock]], who often portrayed characters of a format similar to that of Hay, typically impostors who tried to hide their true identity.&lt;ref name="bbc3essay"/&gt; [[Ronnie Barker]] also cited Hay as an influence, and in 1976 hosted a documentary on [[BBC Radio]] that discussed Hay's life and career.&lt;ref name="bbc1976"/&gt;

==Legacy==
The humour of Hay's films has been described as subversive and similar to that of fellow English comedian [[Frank Randle]]. His films are often characterised as exhibiting traits of [[Anti-authoritarianism]] and having a satirical approach towards how authority figures are portrayed. This is notable with Hay himself, who often played an incompetent authority figure who struggled not to be found out, but whose idiocy was discovered by those around him.&lt;ref name="bbc3essay"/&gt;

In 2009 a posthumous biography of Hay was published with a foreword by [[Ken Dodd]]. Hay never published an autobiography during his lifetime; however, when ill in the 1940s, he had begun writing one, entitled ''I Enjoyed Every Minute''. Excerpts from this unpublished autobiography were included in the 2009 book.&lt;ref name="tomahawk"/&gt;

[[Roy Hudd]] defined Hay as the "supreme master" of [[sketch comedy]].&lt;ref name="bbc1976"/&gt;

Comedian [[Harry Enfield]] created an affectionate parody of Hay as "Will Silly" in his 1989 [[mockumentary]] [[Norbert Smith: A Life]].
