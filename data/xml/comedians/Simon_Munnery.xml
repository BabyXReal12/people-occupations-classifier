'''Simon Munnery''', also known as his characters "'''Alan Parker: Urban Warrior'''" and "'''The League Against Tedium'''", is an English comedian.

He performs mainly to an [[Alternative comedy|alternative]] audience but has pierced the mainstream both with his [[BBC Radio 1]] show in 1997 and his [[BBC2]] television series ''[[Attention Scum!]]'' in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The scum also rises |author=Stephanie Merritt |url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/screen/story/0,6903,439500,00.html |newspaper=[[The Observer]] |date=18 February 2001 |accessdate=17 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His stand-up is often [[satirical]] and political and almost always [[Surrealism|surreal]].

Munnery's experimental style is reflected in his makeshift [[Prop comedy|props]]. As "The League" he often wears a hat crafted from a kettle, and in one of his stand-up shows he plays a character who performs with a metal bucket over his head.

== Early life ==
Born in Middlesex, Munnery grew up in [[Bedmond]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Surrealism in a bucket|url=http://www.harrowtimes.co.uk/news/593294.0/|work=Harrow Times|date=3 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Watford]], and was educated [[Watford Grammar School for Boys]], where he earned four [[A Levels]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081218215900/http://www.watfordboys.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=108&amp;Itemid=86 WGSB Famous Old Boys]&lt;/ref&gt; He read [[natural science]]s at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] but soon lost interest in science and joined the [[Footlights]]. In 1987, he became vice-president with [[Peter Bradshaw]] as president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/03/18/1079199350692.html?from=storyrhs|title=Munnery's the word – Arts – www.theage.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating with "a very high [[Third-class degree|third]]", he did various menial jobs before making his big break into comedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nerdy, cool and in a league of his own|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/4718059/Nerdy-cool-and-in-a-league-of-his-own.html|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=31 July 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; He describes his work as occupying a place between "unfunny comedy" and "shit art".{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

Munnery had a short lived career as a video game programmer. His most famous title was a version of ''[[Asteroids (video game)|Asteroids]]'' for the [[Commodore International]] [[VIC-20]] (a game that [[Jeff Minter]] once described as a "pile of wank").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Halcyon Days |author=James Hague |url=http://dadgum.com/halcyon/BOOK/MINTER.HTM |date=March 1997 |accessdate=19 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also authored several games for the [[ZX81]]. The ZX81 games he wrote: ''Road Race'', ''[[Breakout (video game)|Breakout]]'' and ''[[Space Invaders]]''. The VIC-20 games he wrote were ''Asteroids'', ''[[Bug-Byte|Cosmiads]]'' and ''[[Scramble (video game)|Scramble]]''.

== Career ==

=== Stand-up comedy ===
While at university, Munnery took part in a stand-up double-act called ''God and Jesus'' with [[Stephen Cheeke]]. He also worked (along with [[Steve Coogan]], [[Patrick Marber]], [[Richard Herring]] and [[Stewart Lee]]) at the [[Edinburgh Festival]] in a piece called ''The Dum Show''.

Munnery was brought to the attention of a comedy community as the compere of a post-alternative comedy [[cabaret]] called ''[[Cluub Zarathustra]]'' performed originally in London and later at the Edinburgh Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://splitsider.com/2012/09/cluub-zarathustra-british-comedys-weirdest-secret/|title=Cluub Zarathustra: British Comedy’s Weirdest Secret|date=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Cluub Zarathustra'' featured [[Stewart Lee]], [[Kevin Eldon]], [[Sally Phillips]], [[Johnny Vegas]], [[Julian Barratt]], [[Richard Herring]], [[Roger Mann]], [[Jason Freeman]] and the music of [[Richard Thomas (musician)|Richard Thomas]] and [[Loré Lixenberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/features/cluub_zarathustra_best_kept_secret/|title=Cluub Zarathustra: British Comedy's best-kept secret|last=British Comedy Guide}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.londonnewsonline.co.uk/17474/preview-simon-munnery-celebrates-30-years-stand-soho-theatre/|title=Simon Munnery Celebrates 30 Years in Comedy|last=London News|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215214007/https://www.londonnewsonline.co.uk/17474/preview-simon-munnery-celebrates-30-years-stand-soho-theatre/|archivedate=15 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A television pilot was made of Cluub Zarathustra for [[Channel 4]] in 1996, but was never broadcast. It became the subject of a book by [[Robert Wringham]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gofasterstripe.com/cgi-bin/website.cgi?page=videofull&amp;id=13960|title=Go Faster Stripe}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.list.co.uk/article/42892-robert-wringham-you-are-nothing/|title=Robert Wringham – You Are Nothing|date=25 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Munnery's [[Edinburgh Fringe]] shows include ''Trilogy'', ''Buckethead'' and ''Simon Munnery's Annual General Meeting''.

His 2006 Edinburgh Fringe show, ''AGM'', included the opportunity for the audience to raise questions to discuss as group (such as "is there a God?"). The experience would often continue after the main show, when he takes the audience on tours around town, taking in art galleries, drinks and visits to other shows.

In 2010, Munnery hosted a [[Bright Club]] event at the [[Bloomsbury Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Laugh and learn at Bright Club |author=Carole Jahme |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2010/nov/04/laugh-learn-science-bright-club |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=4 November 2010 |accessdate=9 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Television ===

Futurtv ("Not 'Future TV', oh no. It can't be 'Future TV' – it's right now!") was a BBC production for [[UK Play]] from 1999. There were 13 15-minute episodes. As well as Simon Munnery, it included [[Kombat Opera Presents]] (Loré Lixenberg and Richard Thomas) and a selection of pop videos.

Munnery wrote and hosted the 1999 TV comedy game show, ''[[Either/Or (TV series)|Either/Or]]''.

''[[Attention Scum!]]'' was a television series produced for the [[BBC]] and directed by [[Stewart Lee]], which aired from February 2001. It starred Munnery as 'The League Against Tedium', a character who drove around the United Kingdom in an adapted [[transit van]], preaching to the masses with the help of an opera singer (Loré Lixenberg), a sedated vampire (Richard Thomas), and a monkey (Munnery's wife Janet).

Munnery also appeared in sketches in the first series of ''[[Stewart Lee's Comedy Vehicle]]'' in 2009, and in Lee's ''[[The Alternative Comedy Experience]]'' for [[Comedy Central]].

=== Radio ===
During the 1990s he made several series for [[BBC Radio 1]], one based around his ''League Against Tedium'' character. Others were vehicles for his Alan Parker character, including ''[[Alan Parker (radio show)|Alan Parker]]'', ''[[Alan Parker's 29 Minutes of Truth]]'', and ''[[Alan Parker, Road Warrior]]''.

Munnery has returned to radio in the early 2000s, hosting ''Simon Munnery's Experimental Half Hour'' ("experimental in that it lasts an hour") and ''Simon Munnery Weakly Chats'' on [[Resonance FM]]. He also wrote and performed two four-part [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]] series called "Where Did It All Go Wrong?", which were broadcast in the summer of 2003 and the spring of 2005.

In 1999, together with [[John Hegley]], he made a comedy series for BBC Radio 4 called ''[[The Adventures of John and Tony]]''.

Munnery featured as a "genius" on [[Dave Gorman]]'s ''Genius'' show on Radio 4.

Two DVDs of his work were released in 2007 – the first IAMTV, covering his Perrier Award Nominated show from the 1999 Edinburgh Fringe, was closely followed by ''Hello'' produced by [[Go Faster Stripe]], a more recent stand-up performance.

In the 1990s he regularly contributed a column to the NME as Alan Parker: Urban Warrior.

In 2009, Munnery starred in an award-winning animated rotoscope short, titled 'Yellow Belly End', co-written and directed by Philip Bacon, a student of the National Film and Television School. In the nine-minute film, Munnery appears in a bird costume and contemplates a cliff. He is credited as 'Bird'.
