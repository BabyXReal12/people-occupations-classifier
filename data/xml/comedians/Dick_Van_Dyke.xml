He is the older brother of [[Jerry Van Dyke]] and father of [[Barry Van Dyke]], and his entertainment career has spanned seven decades. He first gained recognition on radio and [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], then he became known for his role as Rob Petrie on the [[CBS]] television sitcom ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]'', which ran from 1961 to 1966. He also gained significant popularity for roles in the musical films ''[[Bye Bye Birdie (film)|Bye Bye Birdie]]'' (1963), ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'' (1964), and ''[[Chitty Chitty Bang Bang]]'' (1968). His other prominent film appearances include roles in ''[[The Comic]]'' (1969), ''[[Dick Tracy (1990 film)|Dick Tracy]]'' (1990), ''[[Curious George (film)|Curious George]]'' (2006), ''[[Night at the Museum]]'' (2006), and ''[[Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb]]'' (2014). Other prominent TV roles include the leads in ''[[The New Dick Van Dyke Show]]'' (1971–74), ''[[Diagnosis: Murder]]'' (1993–2001), and ''[[Murder 101 (film series)|Murder 101]]'' (2006–08) which both co-starred his son [[Barry Van Dyke|Barry]].

Van Dyke is the recipient of five [[Primetime Emmy Award|Primetime Emmys]], a [[Tony Award|Tony]], and a [[Grammy Award]], and was inducted into the [[Television Hall of Fame]] in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dick Van Dyke to receive SAG career award|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-19331193|newspaper=BBC|date=August 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received the [[Screen Actors Guild]]'s highest honor, the SAG Life Achievement Award, in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Dick Van Dyke to Get SAG Life Achievement Award |url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/dick-van-dyke-get-sag-life-achievement-award|work= Associated Press|accessdate= August 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 7021 [[Hollywood Boulevard]] and has also been recognized as a [[Disney Legend]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.hollywoodusa.co.uk/walkoffamestarlocations.htm#V. | title = Hollywood Walk of Fame | accessdate = January 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Van Dyke was born on December 13, 1925, in [[West Plains, Missouri]],&lt;ref name=museumbroadcast&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.museum.tv/eotv/vandykedic.htm | title= Van Dyke, Dick: U.S. Actor | publisher=[[Museum of Broadcast Communications]] | accessdate= September 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; to Hazel Victoria (née McCord; 1896 – 1992), a stenographer, and Loren Wayne "Cookie" Van Dyke (1898–1976), a salesman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vandyke-smith-family.com/vandyke-o/p10.htm |title=The Van Dyke – Smith Research – Person Page |website=Vandyke-smith-family.com |date= |accessdate=September 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZNO3WVTokk0C&amp;pg=PA4519&amp;dq=%22Richard+Wayne+%22Dick%2222+Van+Dyke%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cHo3VO7uIIqZyATyyoHADQ&amp;ved=0CBMQ6AEwAA |title=The Family Forest Descendants of Lady Joan Beaufort |page=4519 |website=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=September 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.today.com/id/42862993/ns/today-today_books/t/van-dyke-recalls-learning-shocking-secret/|title=Van Dyke recalls learning shocking secret|work=TODAY.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up in [[Danville, Illinois]]. He is the older brother of actor [[Jerry Van Dyke]] (1931–2018), who is best known for a role on the TV series ''[[Coach (TV series)|Coach]]''. Van Dyke has [[Dutch people|Dutch]], [[English people|English]], [[Irish people|Irish]], and [[Scottish people|Scottish]] ancestry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dick Van Dyke plays Not My Job|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=130739954|newspaper=NPR  (Wait, Wait ... Don't Tell Me!)|date=October 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a family line that traces back to ''[[Mayflower]]'' passenger [[John Alden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mayflower group not easy to get into|url=http://www.postandcourier.com/article/20111124/PC1602/311249918|newspaper=The Post and Courier|date=March 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Van Dyke's high school classmates in Danville were [[Donald O'Connor]] and [[Bobby Short]], both of whom would go on to successful careers as entertainers.&lt;ref name=memoirluckylife&gt;{{cite book|last=Van Dyke|first=Dick|title=My Lucky Life In and Out of Show Business|publisher=Crown Archetype|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of his closest friends was a cousin of [[Gene Hackman]], the future actor, who also lived in Danville in those years.&lt;ref name=memoirluckylife/&gt; Van Dyke's mother's family was very religious, and for a brief period in his youth, he considered a career in ministry, although a drama class in high school convinced him that his true calling was as a professional entertainer.&lt;ref name=memoirluckylife/&gt; In his autobiography, he wrote, "I suppose that I never completely gave up my childhood idea of being a minister. Only the medium and the message changed. I have still endeavored to touch people's souls, to raise their spirits and put smiles on their faces."&lt;ref name=memoirluckylife/&gt; Even after the launch of his career as an entertainer, he taught Sunday school in the Presbyterian Church, where he was an elder, and he continued to read such theologians as [[Martin Buber|Buber]], [[Paul Tillich|Tillich]], and [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer|Bonhoeffer]], who helped explain in practical terms the relevance of religion in everyday life.&lt;ref name=memoirluckylife/&gt;

Van Dyke left high school in 1944, his senior year, intending to join the [[United States Army Air Forces]] for pilot training during [[World War II]]. Denied enlistment several times for being underweight, he was eventually accepted for service as a [[radio announcer]] before transferring to the [[Special Services (entertainment)|Special Services]] and entertaining troops in the [[continental United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=5jr9L--C4tMC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;lpg=PA43&amp;dq=The+Great+Clowns+of+American+Television#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |page=219 |last=Adir |first=Karin  |title=The Great Clowns of American Television |publisher=[[McFarland &amp; Company|McFarland]] |year=1988 |location=[[Jefferson, North Carolina]] |isbn=0-89950-300-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received his high school diploma in 2004 at the age of 78.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=McGee |first=Noelle |date=May 3, 2004 |title=Van Dyke Gets New Generation of Fans |url=http://www.news-gazette.com/news/local/2004-05-03/van-dyke-gets-new-generation-fans.html |newspaper=The News-Gazette |location=Danville, IL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Radio and stage===
[[File:Dick Van Dyke 1959.jpg|thumb|Van Dyke in a 1959 publicity photo]]
During the late 1940s, Van Dyke was a [[radio DJ]] in [[Danville, Illinois]]. In 1947, Van Dyke was persuaded by  [[Mime artist|pantomime performer]] Phil Erickson&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Staff|first1=Variety|title=Phil Erickson|url=https://variety.com/2000/scene/people-news/phil-erickson-1117796592/|publisher=Variety Media, LLC|date=October 21, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; to form a comedy duo with him called "Eric and Van—the Merry Mutes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/eotvsection.php?entrycode=vandykedic |title=Van Dyke, Dick –  The Museum of Broadcast Communications |publisher=Museum.tv |date= October 21, 1992 |accessdate= December 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team toured the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] nightclub circuit, performing a mime act and [[lip synching]] to old [[Gramophone record|78 records]]. They brought their act to [[Atlanta, Georgia]], in the early 1950s and performed a local television show featuring original skits and music called "The Merry Mutes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.witsendproductions.com/history.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=June 4, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091213021745/http://www.witsendproductions.com/history.htm |archivedate=December 13, 2009 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1959, Van Dyke made his [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] debut in ''The Girls Against the Boys''. He then played the lead role of Albert Peterson in ''[[Bye Bye Birdie (musical)|Bye Bye Birdie]]'', which ran from April 14, 1960, to October 7, 1961. In a May 2011 interview with [[Rachael Ray]], Van Dyke said that when he auditioned for a smaller part in the show he had no experience as a dancer, and that after he sang his audition song he did an impromptu soft-shoe out of sheer nervousness. [[Gower Champion]], the show's director and [[choreographer]], was watching, and promptly went up on stage to inform Van Dyke he had the lead. An astonished Van Dyke protested that he could not dance, to which Champion replied "We'll teach you". That musical won four Tony awards including Van Dyke's [[Tony Award for Best Performance by a Featured Actor in a Musical|Best Featured Actor Tony]], in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.masterworksbroadway.com/artist/dick-van-dyke|title=Masterworks Broadway/Dick Van Dyke|publisher=[[Sony Music Entertainment]]|year=2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1980, Van Dyke appeared as the title role in the first  Broadway revival of ''[[The Music Man]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Goodyear|first=Dana|title=SUPERCALIFRAGILISTIC|url=http://www.newyorker.com/talk/2010/12/13/101213ta_talk_goodyear|newspaper=The New Yorker|date=December 13, 1910}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television===
Van Dyke's start in television was with [[WDSU-TV]] [[New Orleans]] Channel 6 ([[National Broadcasting Company|NBC]]), first as a single comedian and later as [[emcee]] of a comedy program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wyes.org/programs/localprod/goldenage/goldenage_about.html ''New Orleans TV: The Golden Age''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090505173217/http://www.wyes.org/programs/localprod/goldenage/goldenage_about.html |date=May 5, 2009 }}, documentary produced by [[WYES-TV]] New Orleans Channel 12, broadcast July 18, 2009; published at WYES.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.wdsu.com/community/267718/detail.html |title=WDSU Serves New Orleans Since 1948 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927230117/http://www.wdsu.com/community/267718/detail.html |archivedate=September 27, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Dave | last = Walker | publisher = Arcadia | url = http://www.arcadiapublishing.com/news_article.html?id=1429 | title = That old-time TV: New book celebrates 60 years of local stars}}&lt;/ref&gt; Van Dyke's first network TV appearance was with [[Dennis James]] on James' ''[[Chance of a Lifetime (1950s TV series)|Chance of a Lifetime]]'' in 1954. He later appeared in two episodes of ''[[The Phil Silvers Show]]'' during its 1957–58 season. He also appeared early in his career on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[The Pat Boone Chevy Showroom]]'' and [[National Broadcasting Company|NBC]]'s ''[[The Polly Bergen Show]]''. During this time a friend from the Army was working as an executive for CBS television and recommended Van Dyke to that network. Out of this came a seven-year contract with the network.&lt;ref name = King2010 /&gt; During an interview on [[NPR]]'s ''[[Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me!]]'' program, Van Dyke said he was the anchorman for the CBS morning show during this period with [[Walter Cronkite]] as his newsman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | date = October 23, 2010 | url = https://www.npr.org/templates/rundowns/rundown.php?prgId=35&amp;prgDate=10-23-2010 | publisher = [[NPR]] | title = Rundown | chapter = Wait Wait...

[[File:Mary Tyler Moore Dick Van Dyke 1964.JPG|thumb|left|[[Mary Tyler Moore]] and Dick Van Dyke in ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]'', 1964]]
From 1961 to 1966, Van Dyke starred in the [[Columbia Broadcasting Company|CBS]] sitcom ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]'', in which he portrayed a comedy writer named [[Rob Petrie]]. Originally the show was supposed to have Carl Reiner as the lead but CBS insisted on recasting and Reiner chose Van Dyke to replace him in the role.&lt;ref name = King2010 /&gt; Complementing Van Dyke was a veteran cast of comic actors including [[Rose Marie]], [[Morey Amsterdam]], [[Jerry Paris]], [[Ann Morgan Guilbert]], [[Richard Deacon (actor)|Richard Deacon]], and [[Carl Reiner]] (as Alan Brady), as well as 23-year-old [[Mary Tyler Moore]], who played Rob's wife [[Laura Petrie]]. Van Dyke won three [[Primetime Emmy Award|Emmy Award]]s as [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor - Comedy Series|Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series]], and the series received four [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series|Emmy Awards as Outstanding Comedy Series]].&lt;ref name="museum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/eotvsection.php?entrycode=vandykedic |title=The Museum of Broadcast Communications – Encyclopedia of Television |website=Museum.tv |date= |accessdate=September 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1971 to 1974, Van Dyke starred in an unrelated sitcom called ''[[The New Dick Van Dyke Show]]'' in which he portrayed a local television talk show host. Although the series was developed by [[Carl Reiner]] and starred [[Hope Lange]] as his wife, and he received a [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]] nomination for his performance, the show was less successful than its predecessor,&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, Tim; Earl Marsh (2003). ''[[The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows]]''. [[Ballantine Books]]. {{ISBN|0-345-45542-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and Van Dyke pulled the plug on the show after just three seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Dick Van Dyke's prescription for success | url=http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/9803/09/vandyke.diagnosis.lat/ | publisher = CNN | year=2008 | accessdate= October 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1973, Van Dyke voiced his animated likeness for the October 27, 1973 installment of [[Hanna-Barbera]]'s ''[[The New Scooby-Doo Movies]]'', "Scooby-Doo Meets Dick Van Dyke," the series' final first-run episode. The following year, he received an Emmy Award nomination for his role as an alcoholic businessman in the [[television movie]] ''[[The Morning After (1974 film)|The Morning After]]'' (1974). Van Dyke revealed after its release that he had recently overcome a [[Alcoholism|real-life drinking problem]]. He admits he was an [[alcoholic]] for 25 years.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"&gt;de Bertodano, Helena (January 7, 2013).

Which If you're Dancing Is Hard'].  ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''.  Retrieved August 20, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; That same year he guest-starred as a murderous photographer on an episode of ''[[Columbo (TV series)|Columbo]]'', ''[[List of Columbo episodes#Season 4|Negative Reaction]]''. Van Dyke returned to comedy in 1976 with the [[sketch comedy]] show ''Van Dyke and Company,'' which co-starred [[Andy Kaufman]]&lt;ref&gt;''Van Dyke and Company''&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Super Dave Osborne]]. Despite being canceled after three months, the show won an [[Emmy Award]] for Outstanding Comedy-Variety Series.&lt;ref name="museum" /&gt; After a few guest appearances on the long-running comedy-variety series ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]'', Van Dyke became a regular on the show, in the fall of 1977. However, he only appeared in half of the episodes of the final season. For the next decade he appeared mostly in TV movies. One atypical role was as a murdering judge on the second episode of the TV series ''[[Matlock (TV series)|Matlock]]'' in 1986 starring [[Andy Griffith]]. In 1987, he guest-starred in an episode of ''[[Airwolf]]'', with his son [[Barry Van Dyke]], who was the lead star of the show's fourth and final season on [[USA Network]]. In 1989, he guest-starred on the NBC comedy series ''[[The Golden Girls]]'' portraying a lover of [[Beatrice Arthur]]'s character. This role earned him his first Emmy Award nomination since 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/hollywoodpresents/gingame/about/bios.html|title=Retired Site – PBS Programs – PBS|work=Retired Site – PBS Programs – PBS}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Carol Burnett Dick Van Dyke 1977.JPG|thumb|[[Carol Burnett]] and Dick Van Dyke in 1977]]

His film work affected his TV career: the reviews he received for his role as D.A. Fletcher in ''[[Dick Tracy (1990 film)|Dick Tracy]]'' led him to star as the character [[Mark Sloan (Diagnosis: Murder)|Dr. Mark Sloan]] first in an episode of ''[[Jake and the Fatman]]'', then in a series of TV movies on CBS that became the foundation for his popular television drama ''[[Diagnosis: Murder]].'' The series ran from 1993 to 2001 with son [[Barry Van Dyke]] co-starring in the role of Dr. Sloan's son [[Lieutenant Detective Steve Sloan]]. Also starring on the same show was daytime soap actress [[Victoria Rowell]] as Dr. Sloan's pathologist/medical partner, [[Dr. Amanda Bentley]], and [[Charlie Schlatter]] in the role of Dr. Sloan's student, [[Dr. Jesse Travis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.universalchannel.co.uk/shows/diagnosis-murder-s8 |title=Diagnosis Murder S8 &amp;#124; Universal Channel UK |publisher=Universalchannel.co.uk |date= December 13, 1925 |accessdate= February 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Van Dyke continued to find television work after the show ended, including a dramatically and critically successful performance of ''[[The Gin Game]]'', produced for television in 2003 that reunited him with [[Mary Tyler Moore]]. In 2003, he portrayed a doctor on ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]''. A 2004 special of ''The Dick Van Dyke Show'' titled ''The Dick Van Dyke Show Revisited'' was heavily promoted as the first new episode of the classic series to be shown in 38 years. Van Dyke and his surviving cast members recreated their roles; although nominated for a Primetime Emmy,&lt;ref&gt;http://m.emmys.com/shows/dick-van-dyke-show-revisited&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0409892/awards?ref_=m_tt_awd&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=August 2018}} the program was roundly panned by critics. In 2006 he guest-starred as [[college professor]] Dr. Jonathan Maxwell for a series of ''[[Murder 101 (TV film series)|Murder 101]]'' mystery films on the [[Hallmark Channel]].

===Film===
Van Dyke began his film career by playing the role of Albert J. Peterson in the film version of ''[[Bye Bye Birdie (film)|Bye Bye Birdie]]'' (1963). Despite his unhappiness with the adaptation—its focus differed from the stage version in that the story now centered on a previously supporting character&lt;ref&gt;Van Dyke was unhappy because it became a vehicle for [[Ann-Margret]], see "Dick Van Dyke Dances Through Life", Bill Keveney, ''[[USA Today]]'', April 28, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;—the film was a success. That same year, Van Dyke was cast in two roles: as the chimney sweep Bert, and as bank chairman Mr. Dawes Senior, in [[Walt Disney]]'s ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'' (1964). For his scenes as the chairman, he was heavily costumed to look much older and was credited in that role as "Nackvid Keyd" (at the end of the credits, the letters [[anagram|unscramble]] into "Dick Van Dyke"). Van Dyke's attempt at a [[cockney]] accent has been lambasted as one of the worst accents in film history, cited by actors since as an example of how not to sound.

"[[Chim Chim Cher-ee]]", one of the songs that Van Dyke performed in ''Mary Poppins'', won the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] for the [[Sherman Brothers]], the film's songwriting duo.

Many of the comedy films Van Dyke starred in throughout the 1960s were relatively unsuccessful at the box office, including ''[[What a Way to Go!]]'' with [[Shirley MacLaine]], ''[[Lt. Robin Crusoe, U.S.N.]]'', ''[[Fitzwilly]]'', ''[[The Art of Love (1965 film)|The Art of Love]]'' with [[James Garner]] and [[Elke Sommer]], ''[[Some Kind of a Nut]]'', ''[[Never a Dull Moment (1968 film)|Never a Dull Moment]]'' with [[Edward G. Robinson]], and ''[[Divorce American Style]]'' with [[Debbie Reynolds]] and [[Jean Simmons]]. But he also starred as [[Caractacus Pott]] (with his native accent, at his own insistence, despite the English setting) in the successful musical version of [[Ian Fleming]]'s ''[[Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (film)|Chitty Chitty Bang Bang]]'' (1968), which co-starred [[Sally Ann Howes]] and featured the same songwriters (The Sherman Brothers) and choreographers ([[Marc Breaux]] and Dee Dee Wood) as ''Mary Poppins''.

In 1969, Van Dyke appeared in the comedy-drama ''[[The Comic]]'', written and directed by [[Carl Reiner]]. Van Dyke portrayed a self-destructive [[silent film]] era comedian who struggles with [[alcoholism]], [[Clinical depression|depression]], and his own rampant ego. Reiner wrote the film especially for Van Dyke, who often spoke of his admiration for silent film era comedians such as [[Charlie Chaplin]] and his hero [[Stan Laurel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/353393%7C0/The-Comic.html |title=The Comic |publisher= [[Turner Classic Movies]] |date= January 8, 1998 |accessdate= January 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Larry King Live, Van Dyke mentioned he turned down the lead role in ''The Omen'' which was played by Gregory Peck. He also mentioned his dream role would have been the scarecrow in ''The Wizard of Oz''. Twenty-one years later in 1990, Van Dyke, whose usual role had been the amiable hero, took a small but villainous turn as the crooked DA Fletcher in [[Warren Beatty]]'s film ''[[Dick Tracy (1990 film)|Dick Tracy]]''. Van Dyke returned to motion pictures in 2006 with ''[[Curious George (film)|Curious George]]'' as Mr. Bloomsberry and as villain Cecil Fredericks in the [[Ben Stiller]] film ''[[Night at the Museum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://movies.yahoo.com/movie/1810028001/cast|title=Night At The Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian (2009)|publisher=Baseline|year=2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He reprised the role in a cameo for the sequel, ''[[Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian]]'' (2009), but it was cut from the film. It can be found in the special features on the DVD release. He also played the character again in the third film, ''[[Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb]]'' (2014).
