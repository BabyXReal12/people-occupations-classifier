'''Scott Thompson''' (born February 25, 1965) is an [[United States|American]] stand-up comedian and actor.

== Early life ==
Thompson was born on February 25, 1965 in [[Rockledge, Florida]], and grew up in nearby [[Cocoa, Florida]]. He went to Cocoa High School, home of the Tigers, where Scott played drums in the marching and concert band.  At times his humor could be off-putting and he was always doing or saying anything that could get a reaction, usually at the expense of classmates who were not as popular or wealthy as his friends and him.  Popularity was crucial for him and he made sure he was part of the "in" crowd.  He graduated from [[Cocoa High School]] in 1983. He got the nickname "Carrot Top" from a local swimming coach. In the late 80’s, Scott worked as a courier for a mortgage company.&lt;ref name="Orlando Magazine"&gt;{{cite web | title=On Top of the World - March 2016 - Orlando, FL | website=[[Orlando Magazine]] | url=http://www.orlandomagazine.com/Orlando-Magazine/March-2016/On-Top-of-the-World/ | access-date=2018-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; After high school he enrolled at [[Florida Atlantic University]] in [[Boca Raton, Florida|Boca Raton]].
