'''Ben Blue''' (September 12, 1901&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; March 7, 1975), was a [[Canadian-American]] [[actor]] and [[comedian]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

==Biography==
He was born '''Benjamin Bernstein''' in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]] on September 12, 1901 to David Asher Bernstein and Sadie Goldberg. He was [[Jewish]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

Blue emigrated to [[Baltimore, Maryland]] at the age of nine, where he won a contest for the best impersonation of [[Charlie Chaplin]]. At the age of fifteen he was in a touring company and later became a stage manager and assistant general manager. He became a dance instructor and nightclub proprietor. In the 1920s Blue joined a popular orchestra, Jack White and His Montrealers. The entire band emphasized comedy, and would continually interact with the joke-cracking maestro. Blue, the drummer, would sometimes deliver corny jokes while wearing a ridiculously false beard. The band emigrated to the United States, and appeared in two early sound musicals&amp;nbsp;— the [[Vitaphone]] short subject ''Jack White and His Montrealers'' and Universal's feature-length [[Technicolor|2-strip Technicolor]] revue ''[[King of Jazz]]'' (1930).

In 1930, Blue toured with the "Earl Carroll Vanities".

Blue left the band to establish himself as a solo comedian, portraying a bald-headed dumb-bell with a goofy expression. Producer [[Hal Roach]] featured him in his "Taxi Boys" comedy shorts, but Blue's dopey character was an acquired taste and he was soon replaced by other comedians. Later in the 1930s he worked at [[Paramount Pictures]], notably in ''[[The Big Broadcast of 1938]]'', and later at [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], in films such as ''[[Easy to Wed]]''.

He was divorced by his first wife in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |title=Ben Blue Is Sued by Wife |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1937/11/06/archives/ben-blue-is-sued-by-wife.html |quote= |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 6, 1937 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was ordered to pay $600 (approximately ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|600|1937|r=-3}}}} today) monthly alimony. The judge told him: "You are no exception to the rule that theatrical careers do not last long, and yours already has been a long one."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |title=Warns Ben Blue To Save. Judge Orders Comedian to Pay Alimony and Advises Thrift |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1937/12/05/archives/warns-ben-blue-to-save-judge-orders-comedian-to-pay-alimony-and.html |quote= |newspaper=The New York Times |date= December 5, 1937}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1950, he had his own short-lived TV series, ''The Ben Blue Show'', and was also a regular on ''[[The Frank Sinatra Show (CBS TV series)|The Frank Sinatra Show]]''.

[[File:Ben Blue 1954.JPG|thumb|Blue was a guest star on the summer replacement television show ''Saturday Night Revue'' in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0944699/|title=The Saturday Night Revue|date=12 June 1954|publisher=IMDB|accessdate=15 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In 1951, Blue began concentrating on managing and appearing in nightclubs in [[Hollywood, California]] and [[San Francisco]] he once appeared in a [[Reno, Nevada]] nightclub called the Dollhouse where he lost $25,000 to its owner, Bill Welch. Blue and [[Maxie Rosenbloom]] owned and performed in Hollywood's top nightclub in the 1940s called "Slapsie Maxie's." Again, in the 1960s he opened a nightclub in [[Santa Monica, California]], called "Ben Blue's".  It quickly became the "in" place and night after night was packed with top celebrities.  Ben closed the club three years later because of health problems.  Blue made the cover of [[TV Guide|TV Guide's]] June 11, 1954 Special Issue along with [[Alan Young]], headlining an edition featuring that season's summer replacement shows. He also made appearances in TV shows such as ''[[The Jack Benny Program]]'' and ''[[The Milton Berle Show]]''.

In 1958 he had major surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |title=Ben Blue Has Surgery |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1958/04/11/archives/ben-blue-has-surgery.html |quote= |newspaper=The New York Times |date=April 11, 1958 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958 he starred in a television [[Pilot episode|pilot]] called ''Ben Blue's Brothers'', in which he played four different parts. The show did not get picked up by a network, but the pilot was seen in 1965.

In 1964 he was indicted by a federal grand jury on six counts of [[tax evasion]] for the non-payment of more than $39,000 (approximately ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|39000|1964|r=-3}}}} today) in income taxes from the nightclub he operated, the Merry‐Go‐Round, in [[Santa Monica, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |agency= [[United Press International]]|title=Jury Indicts Ben Blue On Income Tax Charges |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/08/07/jury-indicts-ben-blue-on-income-tax-charges.html?mtrref=query.nytimes.com&amp;_r=0|quote= |newspaper=The New York Times |date=August 7, 1964 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was contested for five years, before he pled no contest to a single count of evading corporate tax. He was fined $1,000, with the payment suspended.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

He also had a recurring role in [[Jerry Van Dyke]]'s television series ''[[Accidental Family]]'' in 1967. His film roles included many cameo appearances. In ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' (1963), his role was the pilot of the [[Standard J-1]] biplane that flew [[Sid Caesar]] and [[Edie Adams]], and he played Luther Grilk, the town drunk, in ''[[The Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Coming]]'' (1966). His other film appearances included small roles in ''[[The Busy Body]]'' (1967), ''[[A Guide for the Married Man]]'' (1967) and ''[[Where Were You When the Lights Went Out?]]'' (1968). He made one of his last television appearances in ''[[Land of the Giants]] ''in 1969. He was also seen the following year in the [[Dora Hall]] vanity syndicated television special, "Once Upon a Tour".

Blue died in [[Hollywood, California]] on March 7, 1975.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news |agency= [[United Press International]]|title=Ben Blue, Sad-Faced Comedian, A Performer Five Decades, Dies |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1975/03/09/archives/ben-blue-sadfaced-comedian-a-performer-five-decades-dies.html|quote= |newspaper=The New York Times |date=March 9, 1975 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was interred in the [[Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery]] in [[Culver City, California]].

==Legacy==
After his death, his career papers covering 1935 to 1955 were deposited in the Special Collections at the [[University of California, Los Angeles Library]].
