Retrieved on 2012-02-03.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Lovitz graduated with a theater degree in 1979 from the [[University of California, Irvine|University of California at Irvine]] and then studied acting with Tony Barr at the Film Actors Workshop. He became a member of the [[The Groundlings|Groundlings]] comedy troupe, where he befriended his future ''SNL'' fellow [[Phil Hartman]].
--&gt;

==Career==

===''Saturday Night Live''===
Lovitz was a cast member of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' from 1985 to 1990. He later said in an interview for the book ''Live From New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live'' that his time on ''SNL'' was the most memorable in his career. He went from having no money to being offered a [[United States dollar|$]]500,000 film contract. He was nominated for an [[Emmy Award]] his first two years on ''Saturday Night Live''. One of his most notable ''SNL'' characters was "[[Tommy Flanagan, The Pathological Liar]]" who used an old [[Humphrey Bogart]] line "Yeah! That's the ticket!" as a [[catchphrase]] to punctuate painfully elaborated implausible lies. Other recurring characters included [[Annoying Man]], [[Master Thespian]], [[Tonto]], [[Mephistopheles]], [[Harvey Fierstein]], and [[Michael Dukakis]]. In a 1986 episode of ''Saturday Night Live'', he portrayed a virgin Trekkie, who was scripted to hang his head when asked by [[William Shatner]] if he had ever kissed a girl.

[[Hanukkah Harry]], one of Lovitz's most memorable roles, cast him in 1989 as a Jewish contemporary of [[Santa Claus]] who lives on [[Mount Sinai]] and travels the globe with a cart flown by three donkeys to give bland gifts to Jewish boys and girls. Harry is asked to fill in when Santa falls ill on [[Christmas Eve]].

On February 15, 2015, on the ''[[Saturday Night Live 40th Anniversary Special]]'', he was named by [[Steve Martin]] as one of the many SNL cast members who had died over the years, with the camera cutting to show Lovitz's reaction. Later, his image was seen in a montage of deceased SNL members, with the camera once again cutting to his now "outraged" reaction.&lt;ref name=Zuckerman&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zuckerman|first1=Esther|title=SNL includes still-living Jon Lovitz in its 'In Memoriam' segment|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/02/15/snl-included-jon-lovitz-their-memoriam-segment|accessdate=16 February 2015|publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television series===
Lovitz{{'}}s first stint as a regular in a situation comedy was as Mole, an investigator for a New York City district attorney{{'}}s office, in the short-lived 1985–86 series ''[[Foley Square (TV series)|Foley Square]]'', starring [[Margaret Colin]].

Lovitz was a contestant on [[The New Celebrity Apprentice]] (also known as [[Celebrity Apprentice 8]]), playing for the charity [[St. Jude Children's Research Hospital]]. He was the 6th contestant fired, finishing in 11th place and raising $50,000 for his charity.

===Voiceover work===
Lovitz has lent his voice to several cartoons and films. In ''[[The Critic]]'', he played the title character of [[List of The Critic characters#Jay Prescott Sherman|Jay Sherman]] (using his regular speaking voice). He has made several appearances on ''[[The Simpsons]]'', including as [[Marge Simpson|Marge]]'s prom date [[Artie Ziff]] in "[[The Way We Was]]," the art teacher in "[[Brush with Greatness]]", theater director Llewellyn Sinclair and his sister who owned a daycare center in "[[A Streetcar Named Marge]]", Andre in "[[Homer's Triple Bypass]]", and numerous other appearances (including the character of Jay Sherman in the episode ''[[A Star Is Burns]]'', which was a crossover with ''The Critic''). He was also the voice of Radio in the Hyperion-produced, Disney-distributed animated movie ''[[The Brave Little Toaster]]'' and he lent his voice for a [[Music video|promo]] video for the [[video game]] ''[[Banjo-Kazooie]]''.

===Music===
Lovitz performed a duet with [[Robbie Williams]] on Williams' album ''Swing When You're Winning'' (2001), in the song "Well, Did You Evah." He also performed on the hit series ''[[Two and a Half Men]]'' singing "Save the Orphans" and beat Charlie ([[Charlie Sheen]]) out of the award for best jingle writer.

===Broadway theatre===
He has appeared on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] at the [[Music Box Theatre]] in [[Neil Simon]]'s play ''[[The Dinner Party (play)|The Dinner Party]]'', taking over the lead role from [[Henry Winkler]]. He sang at [[Carnegie Hall]] three times (including Great Performances' ''Ira Gershwin at 100: A Celebration at Carnegie Hall'') and sang the [[The Star-Spangled Banner|national anthem]] at [[Dodger Stadium]] and the [[US Open (tennis)|U.S. Open]].

On October 10, 2001, Lovitz sang a duet (with [[Robbie Williams]]) of the song "[[Well, Did You Evah!]]" at the [[Royal Albert Hall]]. The recording can be found on the ''[[Swing When You're Winning]]'' album.

===Commercial work===
Between 1999 and 2000 Lovitz appeared in a $33 million advertising campaign that featured a series of television commercials promoting the [[Yellow Pages]]. The comic premise was to present Lovitz as the Yellow Pages' author. One of them featured Lovitz saying, "The hardest thing to do is to come up with a simple idea that is also great. And I just thought, 'Oh, the alphabet!' " &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Lovitz returns as the face of the Yellow Pages |first=Rebecca |last=Landwehr |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/denver/stories/2000/02/14/newscolumn1.html |newspaper=Denver Business Journal |date=Feb 13, 2000 |accessdate=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Jon Lovitz's Yellow Pages |url=http://www.demko.com/cb981222.htm |website=Youth'n Up! |accessdate=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, he became the spokesman in an advertising campaign for the [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]] restaurant chain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Lovitz Makes His Subway Debut in MMB Effort |first=David |last=Gianatasio |url=http://www.tv.com/saturday-night-live/jon-lovitz-subway-spokesman/topic/455-233291/msgs.html |newspaper=[[Adweek]] |issn=0199-2864 |date=March 31, 2006 |accessdate=2011-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stand-up comedy===
In 2003, Lovitz began his stand-up career at the [[Laugh Factory]] in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://archives.sfweekly.com/exhibitionist/2015/07/06/jon-lovitz-loves-stand-up-acting-and-singing-but-not-in-that-order|title=Jon Lovitz Loves Stand-Up, Acting, and Singing — But Not in That Order|last=Rotter|first=Joshua|newspaper=SF Weekly|access-date=2016-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Jon Lovitz Comedy Club &amp; Podcast Theatre==
In 2009, ''The Jon Lovitz Comedy Club'' location on [[Universal CityWalk]] in [[Universal Studios Hollywood]] opened.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/hollywood-docket-jon-lovitzs-dispute-750428|title=Hollywood Docket: Jon Lovitz's Dispute With Comedy Club Manager Ends|newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=2016-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A comic short film starring [[Ken Davitian]] ('Borat') and featuring Lovitz was filmed there, directed by [[Brent Roske]] and written by Aaron Davitian. Weekly episodes of ''[[The Adam Carolla Show (podcast)|The Adam Carolla Show]]'', a podcast hosted by comedian [[Adam Carolla]], have been recorded at the City Walk location since early 2011.&lt;ref&gt;AdamCarolla.com (2011).

Retrieved April 15, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jon Lovitz Comedy Club in Universal Studios Hollywood was home to the first MMA Roasted standup comedy show&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mmaroast.com/about-us/history.html|title=History|last=Administrator|website=www.mmaroast.com|access-date=2016-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2009.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

On May 29, 2011, the name was changed to ''the Jon Lovitz Comedy Club &amp; Podcast Theatre''. A premiere event called ''Podammit'' was held, in which [[Kevin Smith]] hosted a variety of six podcasts, including ''Plus One 3D'' with his wife, [[Jennifer Schwalbach Smith|Jennifer Schwalbach]], ''[[Hollywood Babble-On]]'' with [[Ralph Garman]] and ''[[Jay &amp; Silent Bob Get Old]]'' with [[Jason Mewes]], as well as ''The ABCs of SNL'' with Lovitz himself, a 6-episode '[[This Is Your Life]]' style biographical interview about Lovitz's life and career.&lt;ref&gt;http://silentbobspeaks.com/?p=415&lt;/ref&gt; The Club periodically hosted other podcasts such as [[Rob Paulsen]]'s ''Talkin' Toons'' (which subsequently left in October 2013). The Jon Lovitz Comedy Club &amp; Podcast Theater closed on November 5, 2014.&lt;ref name=iuclosed2014&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tillman|first1=Christopher|title=The Jon Lovitz Comedy Club Has Closed|url=http://insideuniversal.net/2014/11/the-jon-lovitz-comedy-club-has-closed/|accessdate=6 November 2014|work=Inside Universal|date=November 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
