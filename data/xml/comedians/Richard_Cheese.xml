'''Richard Cheese &amp; Lounge Against The Machine''' is a [[cover band]] and [[comedy|comedy act]], performing popular songs in a [[lounge music|lounge]]/swing style, reminiscent of [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Dean Martin]], and [[Tony Bennett]]. Lounge singer Richard Cheese is a character created and portrayed by [[Los Angeles]]-based actor/comedian [[Mark Jonathan Davis]].

==History==
Davis developed the Richard Cheese lounge singer idea in the mid-1990s while working as a producer at [[KROQ-FM]] in Los Angeles.  Davis portrayed a character named "Paul The 55-Year-Old Intern" on the [[Kevin and Bean]] morning show, and Paul recorded a single called "Paul On 45," which was a humorous medley of KROQ songs arranged in a swing/big band style.

Davis pitched this idea as an album concept, and the band's debut album ''Richard Cheese: [[Lounge Against the Machine]]'' ("Featuring 16 Swingin' Covers Of Alternative Standards") was released in 2000 by Oglio Records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Turner|first1=Katherine|title=This is the Sound of Irony: Music, Politics and Popular Culture|date=March 3, 2016|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317010548|page=171|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=ReCqCwAAQBAJ|accessdate=18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2000, Davis's Richard Cheese &amp; Lounge Against The Machine band has released twenty albums.

Cheese's second and third albums ''Tuxicity'' and ''I'd Like A Virgin'' were independently released in 2002 and 2004 by Cheese's own label, Ideatown Entertainment (later renamed to Coverage Records).

From 2004-2006, Surfdog Records released three new Richard Cheese CDs: ''Aperitif for Destruction'', ''The Sunny Side of the Moon: The Best of Richard Cheese'', and ''Silent Nightclub.''  Surfdog also re-released ''Tuxicity'' and ''I'd Like A Virgin'' on their label in 2006.

Beginning in 2007, Cheese returned to releasing his own albums through his independent Coverage Records label, about one each year:  ''Dick at Nite,'' ''Viva La Vodka: Richard Cheese Live,'' ''OK Bartender,'' ''A Lounge Supreme,'' ''Live At The Royal Wedding'' and its companion behind-the-scenes album ''The Royal Baby Album,'' ''Back In Black Tie,'' and a Christmas album, ''Cocktails With Santa.''

Cheese also produced an album in 2010 as "Johnny Aloha" called ''Lavapalooza'', with a band of [[Hawaiian music]] musicians performing tiki-style versions of rock and rap songs.  The album cover artwork was created by the artist [[Shag (artist)|Shag]].

In late 2015, Cheese released 3 new CDs:  a live album titled ''Bakin' At The Boulder,'' a [[Star Wars]] tribute called ''The Lounge Awakens: Richard Cheese &amp; Lounge Against The Machine Live At The Mos Eisley Spaceport Cantina,'' and a new studio album ''Supermassive Black Tux.''  In 2016, because Richard Cheese sang two songs in the motion picture [[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]], the band released a one-track parody album called ''Richard Cheese: Live At Wayne Financial Tower'' in which the band's performance is cut short by [[Superman]]'s heat vision.

The Richard Cheese &amp; Lounge Against The Machine band released a new studio album on CD titled "Licensed To Spill" on October 16, 2017, and a greatest hits digital compilation titled "Lord Of The Swings: The Best Of Richard Cheese, Volume 2" on February 3, 2018.  A career retrospective boxed set titled "Grateful: 21 Years Of Richard Cheese &amp; Lounge Against The Machine 2000-2020" is scheduled for release in 2020.

The Richard Cheese &amp; Lounge Against The Machine band has toured extensively around the United States and has performed shows in England, Portugal, The Bahamas, and Canada.

The band is currently headlining regularly at [[Red Rock Casino]] in Las Vegas.

Richard Cheese's cover of [[Disturbed (band)|Disturbed]]'s "[[Down With The Sickness]]" was featured in the 2004 [[Zack Snyder]]-directed remake of ''[[Dawn of the Dead (2004 film)|Dawn of the Dead]]''.  Snyder also included Richard Cheese songs in his 2016 Warner Bros. film ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tilles|first1=Jay|title=How a Richard Cheese Song Made it into Batman V Superman|url=http://radio.com/2016/03/24/richard-cheese-batman-v-superman-song/|accessdate=18 August 2017|date=March 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Warner Bros. then hired RC&amp;LATM to perform and appear as animated LEGO mini-figs in the 2017 film ''[[The Lego Batman Movie]],'' singing the song "Man In The Mirror," and performing an "elevator-music" version of "Everything Is Awesome."

Richard Cheese has made numerous television appearances, including performances on ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'', on [[CNN]]'s ''[[Anderson Cooper 360°]]'' for New Year's Eve, [[ESPN]] for a Las Vegas [[March Madness]] broadcast, ''[[Fox &amp; Friends]]'' on [[Fox News Channel]], [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]]'s ''[[The Jonathan Ross Show]]'' in England, and as the Vegas house band on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Last Call with Carson Daly]]'' and [[MTV]]'s ''[[Say What? Karaoke]]'' series.

Richard Cheese &amp; Lounge Against The Machine songs have been featured on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Dancing With The Stars]],'' [[NBC]]'s ''[[Las Vegas (TV series)|Las Vegas]]'' series, and [[NBC]]'s ''[[Passions]]'' soap opera.  
In April 2017, the band's swing cover of [[Depeche Mode]]'s "Personal Jesus" was featured in an episode of [[HBO]]'s ''[[The Leftovers (TV series)|The Leftovers]]'' series.

Richard Cheese has also been featured on radio morning shows and syndicated radio programs such as [[Dr. Demento|The Dr. Demento Show]], [[KROQ-FM]]'s [[Kevin and Bean]], ''[[Jonathon Brandmeier]],'' ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'', [[Opie and Anthony]], ''[[The Bob and Sheri Show]]'', ''[[The Adam Carolla Show (radio)|The Adam Carolla Show]]'', and ''[[Gonzo Greg|Gonzo in the Morning]]''.

Davis is currently writing an autobiography about the band, titled ''"Atlas Lounged: The Music, Martinis, And Madness Behind Richard Cheese &amp; Lounge Against The Machine,"'' which is scheduled to be completed in 2018.

==Band members==
The present line-up of the Lounge Against The Machine band consists of:

* Richard Cheese: vocals
* Bobby Ricotta: piano and keyboards
* Frank Feta: drums and percussion
* Billy Bleu: upright bass and bass

The names are all [[pseudonym]]s that refer to types of cheese ([[Ricotta]], [[Feta]], [[Blue cheese|Bleu]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stapleton|first1=Susan|title=Cheese whiz Richard Cheese slices two sets in Las Vegas|url=http://www.latimes.com/travel/lasvegas/lasvegasnow/la-tr-lvn-las-vegas-shows-richard-cheese-20150202-story.html|website=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=18 August 2017|date=February 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name Richard Cheese itself is a pun on "[[dick cheese]]", a slang term; "Lounge Against The Machine" is a reference to [[Rage Against the Machine]].

The role of pianist and musical director Bobby Ricotta is currently played by Noel Melanio; previously the role was played by David Adler.  The band's first drummer Buddy Gouda was played by Todd LaValley, and then by Charles Byler.  Byler left the band in 2004; he was replaced by Brian Fishler and the drummer's stage name was changed to Frank Feta.  The role of bass player Gordon Brie was first portrayed by Christopher Monaco.  The current bass player, Billy Bleu, is portrayed by Ron Belcher.  Other bassists who have performed with the band include Gus Seyffert, Skip Ward, Jeff Novack, Nathan Peck, Steve Jones, John Hatton, Louie Allen, Pablo Motta, and Michael Bordelon.  The band has also worked with numerous [[Session musician|session musicians]] and performers, including horn players Cleto Escobedo III, Eric Jorgensen, Terry Landry, Lee Thornburg, and Bill Churchville, bassist [[Will Lee (bassist)|Will Lee]], guitarists [[Jimmy Vivino]] and [[John Pizzarelli]], percussionist Joey DeLeon, [[theremin]] player [[Pamelia Kurstin]], and singers [[Fred Schneider]], [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]]'s [[Corey Taylor]], and [["Weird Al" Yankovic]].
