Dailey; ''North American Theatre Online'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
He was born in [[Manhattan, New York City]] on January 5, 1868. He was raised in Brooklyn along the banks of the East River.&lt;ref name="Benjamin_182"&gt;''Who Sang What on Broadway, 1866-1996: The Singers'' 2006 by Ruth Benjamin, Arthur Rosenblatt p.182&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Local East Village - Local Legends"&gt;[http://eastvillage.thelocal.nytimes.com/2010/11/29/local-legends-peter-f-dailey/ The Local East Village – Local Legends – November 29, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;''Celebrated Comedians of Light Opera and Musical Comedy in America'' by Lewis Clinton Strang 1901 pg. 293&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Burr McIntosh monthly, Issues 65-69 1908&lt;/ref&gt;
Dailey was the youngest of two sons and a daughter born to New York natives, Owen and Mary Dailey.&lt;ref&gt;1870 US Census Records&lt;/ref&gt; In later years friends of his father, who was a [[fishmonger]] and active in city politics, would say of his son Peter, that the apple did not fall far from the tree.&lt;ref&gt;''Vaudeville, Old and New'' by Frank Cullen, Florence Hackman, Donald McNeilly&lt;/ref&gt; By time of the 1880 census Dailey and his siblings were being raised by their widowed mother. She supported her family working as a dressmaker, while William, her sixteen-year-old son helped out as a salesman.&lt;ref&gt;1880 US Census Records&lt;/ref&gt;  Dailey had a much younger brother, Robert L. Dailey (1885–1934), who became a vaudeville player active in the early years of the twentieth century.&lt;ref name="Benjamin_182"/&gt; As a young boy Dailey enjoyed hanging about the docks and piers that populated the banks of the East River at that time, often bantering with the odd assortment of stevedores, sailors and steamship passengers that would cross his path.&lt;ref name="The Local East Village - Local Legends"/&gt;

==Career==

After the troupe disbanded Dailey performed for three years at the [[Howard Athenaeum]] in Boston, where for a season he played Le Blanc in the [[extravaganza]] ''Evangeline''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=VHIRAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=goodwin+rice++Evangeline&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=wwWKTuTCNbKlsQLCvcDODw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "''Evangeline'': Opera Bouffe"] by [[Edward E. Rice]] and [[J. Cheever Goodwin]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; His breakout role came in New York in 1892 playing Jack Potsand Poole in ''A Straight Tip'', with James T. Powers.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''A History Of The New York Stage'' volume 3 by Thomas Allston Brown 1903 p. 382&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the following seasons Bailey would find success in such farce comedies as ''A Country Sport ''by John J. McNally at the [[Hollis Street Theatre]]&lt;ref&gt;''The Opera Glass'' – 1894 p. 124–126&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Night Clerk'' with [[Jennie Yeamans]] and [[Raymond Hitchcock (actor)|Raymond Hitchcock]]. After these engagements Dailey became a regular performer with [[Weber and Fields]] in New York. In 1900 he starred with [[Christie MacDonald]] in the musical comedy ''Hodge, Podge and Co'', based on ''Im Himmelhof'', a German farce adapted by George V. Hobert and in 1902 with Ada Lewis in [[Augustus Thomas]]’ Champaign Charley.&lt;ref&gt;''The Actors' Birthday Book'': (Ada Lewis ) Volume 1 by Johnson Briscoep. 1907 p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Theatre Magazine'' vol. 1 1901 p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;
Dailey would remain demand performing in a number of productions over the remainder of the first decade of the new century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibdb.com/person.php?id=67221 Peter F. Dailey Broadway Internet Datatabase]&lt;/ref&gt; His last performance came in 1908 in ''The Merry Widow Burlesque''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibdb.com/show.php?id=6036 The Merry Widow Burlesque - Internet Broadway Database]&lt;/ref&gt; with [[May Irwin]].

==Death==
Peter Dailey died in Chicago on May 23, 1908, after a brief struggle with [[pneumonia]]. At the time he was starring in ''The Merry Widow Burlesque'', that had just completed its five-month run in New York.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=6496 The Merry Widow Burlesque - Internet Broadway Database]&lt;/ref&gt; Dailey was barely able to finish his opening night performance at Chicago's Colonial Theater and died just a few days later.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"P.F. Dailey Dead" - ''Syracuse Herald'' May 23, 1908 p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Dailey is interred at [[Green-Wood Cemetery]] in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]].

He had planned to marry singer [[Kate Condon]], who several years earlier had appeared with him in ''The Press Agent'', at Lew M. Weber’s theatre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=6143 The Press Agent  –Internet Broadway Database]&lt;/ref&gt; Condon’s husband had disappeared in 1903 and she needed permission from the church to remarry. That spring she traveled to Rome to seek a [[Papal dispensation]] to marry Dailey. Her cable informing him that she had been successful arrived just hours after he died.&lt;ref&gt;''The Oakland Tribune'' May 24, 1908 p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In his obituary, ''The Hartford Courant'' wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Pete Daily was a genial warmhearted man who made friends where ever he went. He was an actor of much originality and really made his own parts as he paid little attention to the lines of the playwright. Introducing his own, and his “gagging” of his parts was as amusing to his stage associates as those in the audience. He was natural comedian as full of life and fun off the stage as on.&lt;ref&gt;"Death of Pete Dailey" - ''The Hartford Courant'', May 25, 1908 p. ?&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
