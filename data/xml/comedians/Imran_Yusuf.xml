'''Imran Yusuf''' (born 26 November 1979) is a [[Kenya]]n-born [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Stand-up comedy|stand-up]] [[comedian]] of [[Indian people|Indian]] [[Konkani Muslim]] descent. Yusuf came to notice following rave reviews and a Best Newcomer nomination for the Foster’s Edinburgh Comedy Awards&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.comedyawards.co.uk/|title=lastminute.com / Edinburgh Comedy Awards|last=Premier|website=Edinburgh Comedy Awards|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe|Edinburgh Festival Fringe 2010]] and appearing on ''[[Michael McIntyre's Comedy Roadshow]]'', both in the summer of 2010.

==Early life and career==
Yusuf was born in [[Mombasa]], [[Kenya]] to ethnic [[Kenyan Asian|Indian]] parents of [[Konkani Muslim]] origin, and initially grew up in [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]], East London, before moving to [[Harrow, London|Harrow]], North-West London. Both his parents and two older brothers became refugees of the economic war following the [[expulsion of Asians from Uganda]] by [[Idi Amin]] in 1972. Yusuf also attended school in the USA from 1992 to 1993 and attended William Allen III Middle School in [[Moorestown Township, New Jersey|Moorestown, New Jersey]].

He initially worked in the [[video game industry]], where he worked at the European office of the American company [[Midway Games]]. He worked on the development for several Midway [[video game]]s such as ''[[Spy Hunter (2001 video game)|Spy Hunter]]'' (2001). He also worked for the UK publisher [[Eidos Interactive]] on the [[Championship_Manager_series|Championship Manager]] franchise in 2005.

==Comedy career==
Imran Yusuf initially performed two open spots in 2000 at a comedy show hosted by comedian [[Jeff Mirza]], but then did not choose to pursue stand-up comedy in until the summer of 2003 while on sabbatical from his career in the video games industry. He was the first winner of the "You Must Be Joking" stand-up competition at Newbury Comedy Festival in 2004. In 2010, he finally made his impact at the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] in 2010 with his first solo show ''An Audience with Imran Yusuf'' receiving five-star reviews&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/shows/edinburgh_fringe_2010/a/18154/an_audience_with_imran_yusuf/review|title=An Audience With Imran Yusuf :     Chortle : The UK Comedy Guide|last=Solutions|first=Powder Blue Internet Business|website=www.chortle.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a nomination from the Foster's [[Edinburgh Comedy Awards]] for Best Newcomer. Yusuf was the first performer in a free show to have received a nomination for the award.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.laughinghorsecomedy.co.uk/freefestival/index.htm|title=The Free Fringe Festival - Edinburgh &amp; Brighton Fringes 2010|website=www.laughinghorsecomedy.co.uk|access-date=2018-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that summer, Yusuf appeared on ''Michael McIntyre's Comedy Roadshow''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/clips/p00b64lp/michael_mcintyres_comedy_roadshow_imran_yusuf_-_racism/ Comedy Roadshow appearance]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/201092/Michael-McIntyre-s-Comedy-Roadshow|title=Michael McIntyre's Comedy Roadshow|last=9.25pm|first=BBC1,|date=2010-09-25|work=Express.co.uk|access-date=2018-04-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; October and November saw Imran begin crafting his 2011 Edinburgh show with special invitation gigs, plus releasing official confirmation of his 43 date UK tour ''An Audience with Imran Yusuf'' starting in February 2011 at London’s Soho Theatre. On radio, Boxing Day 2010 saw Imran's debut on [[BBC Radio 7]]'s ''The Now Show'' for a satirical look at current affairs and news. The special 45-minute show used Radio 4’s format for an extended show with Imran and guests. A follow-up appearance on [[BBC Radio 4]]'s prestigious ''[[The News Quiz]]'' came soon after in February 2011, along with his television debut on [[BBC Two]]'s ''[[How TV Ruined Your Life]]'' with [[Charlie Brooker]], offering an opportunity to see Imran in sketch-show action in the episode "Aspiration". Further to this, between March and April Imran made a second appearance on ''[[The Now Show]]'' and a debut special guest slot on ''[[Arthur Smith's Balham Bash]]'' ([[BBC Radio 4 Extra]]).

Summer 2011 soon saw more great news and opportunities coming for Imran when [[Zai Bennett]], controller at BBC Three, green-lit ''The Imran Yusuf Show''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/news/commissioning/comedian-to-front-bbc3-pilot/5028451.article|title=Comedian to front BBC3 pilot|work=Broadcast|access-date=2018-04-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a broadcast pilot in anticipation of a series for the show. Interest from [[BBC America]] also saw Imran record a performance for Funny As Hell,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comicvoice.com/archives/706.html BBC America - Funny As Hell announcement]&lt;/ref&gt; a stand-up series presenting the best of British comedy in the United States. Soon came Edinburgh Fringe 2011 where Imran took his all new show ''Bring The Thunder'' to the festival. Continuing with the previous year's trend of recording TV slots during the festival; Imran recorded a section of his show for Edinburgh Comedy Fest Live 2011&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comicvoice.com/archives/828.html Edinburgh Comedy Fest Live Recording]&lt;/ref&gt; and BBC Comedy Presents: Free@TheFringe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/clips/p00k0z3s/comedy_the_fringe_imran_yusuf_and_joel_dommett/ BBC Comedy Presents Three@TheFringe]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, he starred as Ed in the series ''[[Fried (TV series)|Fried]]''.
