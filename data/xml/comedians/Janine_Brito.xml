'''Janine Brito''' is an American [[stand-up comic]]. Prominent within the [[San Francisco]] stand-up comedy scene, she is recognized nationally as a writer and on-air [[correspondent]] for the [[television program]] ''[[Totally Biased with W. Kamau Bell]]'', which premiered on [[FX (TV channel)|FX]] in 2012 and was canceled early in its second [[Television season#Seasons.2Fseries|season]] due to a drop in [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] after the series was moved to FX's [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] [[Television network|network]] [[FXX]].

==Early life and career==
Brito was born in [[Florida]], though she went on to attend junior high school in [[Scotland]] and [[Hong Kong]] and high school in [[Kentucky]]. After high school, Brito moved to [[St. Louis]] to pursue a business degree at the [[Washington University in St. Louis]].&lt;ref name="swan"&gt;{{cite web|last=Swan|first=Rachel|title=A New Look For Janine Brito|url=http://www.eastbayexpress.com/oakland/a-new-look-for-janine-brito/Content?oid=2414152|publisher=East Bay Express|accessdate=November 1, 2013|date=2 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once she graduated from college, she remained in St. Louis and launched her comedy career.  Though she was politically active in college with the student and [[labor rights]] [[Political movement|movement]], her comedy wasn't explicitly [[political]] at first.&lt;ref name="feministing"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Feministing Five: Hari Kondabolu and Janine Brito|url=http://feministing.com/2012/07/07/the-feministing-five-hari-kondabolu-and-janine-brito/|publisher=Feministing|date=7 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, she moved to [[Oakland]] specifically for the city's  [[comedy]] scene and reputation for fostering [[Progressivism|progressive]] comics. It was in Oakland that she honed her focus on [[identity politics]] and decided to take more risks in her act, such as adopting her signature [[androgynous]] style.&lt;ref name="swan"  /&gt;

Shortly after moving to the [[Bay Area]] around 2008, Brito met comic [[W. Kamau Bell]]. Bell quickly became a [[mentor]] to Brito, taking her under his wing as his “comedy daughter." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bendix|first=Trix|title=Janine Brito is Totally Biased|url=http://www.afterellen.com/janine-brito-is-totally-biased/09/2013/|publisher=AfterEllen.com|date=30 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2010, she joined Bell and fellow comic [[Nato Green]] in [[Laughter Against the Machine]], a political comedy [[Concert tour#Concert tour|tour]] that was subsequently made into a [[documentary]] set to premiere in 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Laughter Against The Machine Official Site|url=http://laughteragainstthemachine.wordpress.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2012, Bell invited Brito to join the writing staff of his new FX series ''[[Totally Biased with W. Kamau Bell]]''.  In addition to writing on the series, Brito frequently appeared on air in pieces covering topics like Miss Fire Island, LGBTQ athletes, and the "war on women."

==Comedy style==
Her colleague and longtime friend [[W. Kamau Bell]] describes Brito as “a sarcastic, snarky smart bomb of comedy funk straight from the 80′s.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Janine Brito - ABOUT|url=http://www.janinebrito.com/about|accessdate=November 10,  2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Brito is often placed within the [[alternative comedy]] scene and tends to focus on issues of [[gender]], [[race (human classification)|race]], and [[sexuality]]. She frequently derives humor from her half-[[Cubans|Cuban]] background and her childhood fixation on worrying about being the [[Antichrist]]. She is also known for her [[sartorial]] choices and frequent donning of [[neckties]]. An article written by [[feminist]] website [[Feministing]], says her comedy is "a punch in the face of convention and offers a refreshing departure from the straight, white, male [[narrative]] that usually relies on tired tropes and [[stereotypes]]."&lt;ref name="feministing"  /&gt;

==Reception==
Brito won the SF Women’s Comedy Competition in 2009 and the Silver Nail Award from local SF bcasting network [[Rooftop Comedy]]. She was also praised by ''[[7x7 (magazine)|7×7]]'' magazine as “one of SF’s more daring voices” and as one of “the 7 funniest people in town.” She was named the 2011 “Best Comedian with a Message” by the ''[[East Bay Express]]''.&lt;ref name="swan"  /&gt; At the start of the 2013 season, ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' wrote in one review of ''Totally Biased'', "Also: more Janine Brito, please. ''Totally Biased'' needs so much more of her.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Viruet|first=Pilot|title=Late Night Roundup: Totally Biased With W Kamau Bell – Week of September 4-11, 2013|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/totally-biased-with-w-kamau-bell-week-of-september,102758/|publisher=The A.V.
