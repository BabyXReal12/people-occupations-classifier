'''Robert Reiner''' (born March 6, 1947) is an American actor, director, producer, and writer. As an actor, Reiner first came to national prominence with the role of [[Michael Stivic]] on ''[[All in the Family]]'' (1971–1979), a role that earned him two [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor – Comedy Series|Emmy Awards]] during the 1970s. As a director, Reiner was recognized by the [[Directors Guild of America]] (DGA) with nominations for the coming of age comedy-drama film ''[[Stand by Me (film)|Stand by Me]]'' (1986), the romantic comedy ''[[When Harry Met Sally...]]'' (1989), and the military courtroom drama ''[[A Few Good Men]]'' (1992). He also directed the psychological horror-thriller ''[[Misery (film)|Misery]]'' (1990), the romantic comedy fantasy adventure ''[[The Princess Bride (film)|The Princess Bride]]'' (1987), and the heavy metal [[mockumentary]] ''[[This Is Spinal Tap]]'' (1984).

== Early life ==
Reiner was born to a [[Jewish]] family in [[the Bronx]], New York, and is the son of [[Estelle Reiner]] (née Lebost; 1914–2008), an actress, and [[Carl Reiner]] (born 1922), a renowned comedian, actor, writer, producer and director.&lt;ref name="filmref"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/74/Rob-Reiner.html |title=Rob Reiner Biography (1947–) |publisher=Filmreference.com |date= |accessdate=February 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a child, Reiner lived at 48 Bonnie Meadow Road in [[New Rochelle, New York]]; the home of the fictional Petrie family in ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]'', created by Rob's father, was 148 Bonnie Meadow Lane. He studied at the [[UCLA Film School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tft.ucla.edu/alumni/notable—-directors/ |title=Alumni of the UCLA Film School |publisher=Tft.ucla.edu |date= |accessdate=February 24, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810194339/http://www.tft.ucla.edu/alumni/notable%E2%80%94-directors/ |archivedate=August 10, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
[[File:Bernadette Peters on All in The Family.JPG|thumb|left|Reiner (with [[Bernadette Peters]]) as Michael Stivic on ''All in the Family'', 1976]]
In the late 1960s, Reiner acted in bit roles in several television shows including ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'', ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'', ''[[Room 222]]'', ''[[Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.]]'' and ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]''.  He began his career writing for the ''[[Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour]]'' in 1968 and 1969, with [[Steve Martin]] as his writing partner as the two youngest writers on the show. Two years later, Reiner became famous playing Michael Stivic, Archie Bunker's liberal son-in-law, on [[Norman Lear]]'s 1970s situation comedy ''[[All in the Family]]'', which was the most-watched television program in the United States for five seasons (1971–1976).  The character's nickname, Meathead, became closely associated with him, even after he had left the role and went on to build a career as a director.  Reiner has stated, "I could win the [[Nobel Prize]] and they'd write 'Meathead wins the Nobel Prize'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yehey.com/entertainment/celebs/article.aspx?id=106489 |title=Yehey! Entertainment |publisher=Yehey.com |date= |accessdate=February 24, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311133819/http://www.yehey.com/entertainment/celebs/article.aspx?id=106489 |archivedate=March 11, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For his performance, Reiner won two [[Emmy Awards]] in addition to three other nominations and five [[Golden Globe]] nominations. After an extended absence, Reiner has recently returned to television acting with a recurring role on ''[[New Girl]]'' (2012–2018).

In 1972, Reiner, Phil Mishkin, and Gerry Isenberg created the situation comedy ''[[The Super (TV series)|The Super]]'' for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. Starring [[Richard S. Castellano]], the show depicted the life of the harried Italian American [[Building superintendent|superintendent]] of a New York City [[apartment building]] and ran for 10 episodes in the summer of 1972. Reiner and Mishkin co-wrote the premiere episode.

Beginning in the 1980s, Reiner became known as a director of several successful Hollywood films that spanned many different genres. Some of his earlier films include cult classics such as the rock-band [[mockumentary]]  ''[[This Is Spinal Tap]]'' (1984) and the comedic fantasy film ''[[The Princess Bride (film)|The Princess Bride]]'' (1987), as well as his period piece coming of age tale ''[[Stand by Me (film)|Stand by Me]]'' (1986). He often collaborates with film editor [[Robert Leighton (film editor)|Robert Leighton]], whom he also shares with fellow director-actor [[Christopher Guest]] as their go-to editor.

Reiner has gone on to direct other critically and commercially successful films with his own company, [[Castle Rock Entertainment]]. These include the romantic comedy ''[[When Harry Met Sally...]]'' (1989), which has been critically ranked among the all-time best of its genre,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | publisher = [[American Film Institute]] | title = AFI's 10 Top 10 | date = 2008-06-17 | url = http://www.afi.com/10top10/romanticcomedy.html | accessdate=2008-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; the tense thriller ''[[Misery (film)|Misery]]'' (1990), for which [[Kathy Bates]] won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]], and his most commercially successful work, the military courtroom drama ''[[A Few Good Men]]'' (1992), which was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/people/chart/?id=robreiner.htm |title=Rob Reiner |publisher=Box Office Mojo |date= |accessdate=February 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent films directed by Reiner include the political romance ''[[The American President]]'' (1995), the courtroom drama ''[[Ghosts of Mississippi]]'' (1996), and the uplifting comedy ''[[The Bucket List]]'' (2007).

Reiner has continued to act in supporting roles in a number of movies and television shows, including ''[[Throw Momma from the Train]]'' (1987), ''[[Sleepless in Seattle]]'' (1993), ''[[Bullets Over Broadway]]'' (1994), ''[[The First Wives Club]]'' (1996), ''[[Primary Colors (film)|Primary Colors]]'' (1998),  ''[[EDtv]]'' (1999), ''[[New Girl]]'' (2012–2018), and ''[[The Wolf of Wall Street (2013 film)|The Wolf of Wall Street]]'' (2013). He has also parodied himself with cameos in works such as ''[[Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star]]'' (2003) and ''[[30 Rock]]'' (2010).

== Politics and activism ==
[[File:Rob Reiner at Howard Dean rally.JPG|left|thumb|Rob Reiner speaking at a [[Howard Dean]] rally on Oct 29, 2003]]
Reiner has devoted considerable time and energy to [[Modern liberalism in the United States|leftist]] activism in recent years. His lobbying as an anti-smoking advocate, in particular, prompted his likeness to be used in a satirical role in a ''[[South Park]]'' episode titled "[[Butt Out]]".

Reiner is a co-founder of the [[American Foundation for Equal Rights]], which initiated the court challenge against [[California Proposition 8]] which banned same-sex marriage in the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wehoconfidential.com/2010/08/civil-rights-activist-director-rob.html |title=Civil Rights Activist: Director Rob Reiner |publisher=WeHo Confidential |date=August 2010 |accessdate=April 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:DIG13955 105.jpg|right|thumb|Reiner at the [[LBJ Presidential Library]] in 2016]]
In 1998, Reiner chaired the campaign to pass Prop 10, the [[California Proposition 10 (1998)|California Children and Families Initiative]], which created First 5 California, a program of early childhood development services, funded by a tax on tobacco products. He served as the first chairman of First 5 California, from 1999 to 2006. Reiner came under criticism for campaigning for a ballot measure (Prop 82) to fund state-run preschools while still chair of the First Five Commission, causing him to resign from his position on March 29, 2006. An audit was conducted, and it concluded that the state commission did not violate state law and that it had clear legal authority to conduct its public advertising campaigns related to preschool. In the end, Prop 82 failed to win approval, garnering only 39.1% support.

Reiner is a member of the Social Responsibility Task Force, an organization advocating moderation where social issues (such as violence and tobacco use) and the entertainment industry meet. He is also active in environmental issues, and he successfully led the effort to establish California's [[Upper Las Virgenes Canyon Open Space Preserve|Ahmanson Ranch]] as a state park and wildlife refuge rather than as a commercial real estate development. He introduced [[Spinal Tap (band)|Spinal Tap]] at the London Live Earth concert in July 2007.

Reiner was mentioned as a possible candidate to run against California Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] in 2006 but decided not to run for personal reasons. He campaigned extensively for [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] presidential nominee [[Al Gore]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 Presidential election]], and he campaigned in [[Iowa]] for Democratic Presidential candidate [[Howard Dean]] just before the 2004 Iowa caucuses. He endorsed [[Hillary Clinton]] for president for the 2008 election. In 2015, he donated US$10,000 to [[Correct the Record]], a political action committee which supported Hillary Clinton's [[Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2016|2016 presidential campaign]].&lt;ref name="correcttherecordcenter2016"&gt;{{cite web|title=Correct the Record: Contributors, 2016 cycle|url=https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/pacgave2.php?cycle=2016&amp;cmte=C00578997|website=opensecrets.com|publisher=[[Center for Responsive Politics]]|accessdate=September 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 2016 election, he has continued to campaign against Donald Trump, calling him a racist, sexist, anti-gay, and anti-Semitic, and compared him to the Nazi police at Auschwitz.&lt;ref&gt;interview on MSNBC, November 11, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Reiner serves on the Advisory Board of the Committee to Investigate Russia.&lt;ref name=InvestigateRussia&gt;{{cite web | title = Committee to Investigate Russia: Advisory Board | url = https://investigaterussia.org/advisory-board | website = Committee to Investigate Russia | access-date = February 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Rob Reiner married actress/director [[Penny Marshall]] in 1971. Marshall's daughter, actress [[Tracy Reiner]] (''A League of Their Own''), was from a previous marriage to Michael Henry. Reiner and Marshall divorced in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;Abramowitz, p. 291&lt;/ref&gt;

Reiner was introduced to his future wife, photographer Michele Singer, while directing ''When Harry Met Sally''. The meeting not only resulted in his deciding to change the ending of that movie,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ihnat|first1=Gwen|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/rob-reiner-his-favorite-films-and-why-he-changed-e-242010|title=Rob Reiner on his favorite films, and why he changed the ending of When Harry Met Sally…|date=September 3, 2016|work=The A.V. Club|accessdate=September 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he also married Singer in 1989. They have three children, Jake (born 1991), Nick (born 1993), and Romy (born 1998). In 1997, Reiner and Singer founded the "I Am Your Child Foundation," and in 2004, they founded the "Parents' Action for Children," a non-profit organization with a dual purpose: a) to raise awareness of the importance of a child's early years by producing and distributing celebrity-hosted educational videos for parents, and b) to advance public policy through parental education and advocacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lavoie|first=Richard|title=It's So Much Work to Be Your Friend|year=2005|publisher=Touchstone|location=New York|isbn=978-0-7432-5463-2|page=xvii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reiner has stated that his childhood home was not observantly Jewish, although he did have a [[Bar and Bat Mitzvah|Bar Mitzvah]] ceremony;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejc.com/lifestyle/lifestyle-features/76866/rob-reiner-at-last-i%E2%80%99m-having-what-she%E2%80%99s-having|title=Rob Reiner: At last, I’m having what she’s having|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reiner's father Carl has acknowledged that he himself became an atheist as the [[Holocaust]] progressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.momentmag.com/funnyman-carl-reiner/|title=Funnyman Carl Reiner|date=1 May 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He identified himself as having no religious affiliation on the January 13, 2012, episode of ''[[Real Time with Bill Maher]]'' and as an atheist.&lt;ref name=reinerbelief&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/debra-ollivier/rob-reiner-on-the-magic-o_b_1618957.html |title=Debra Ollivier: Rob Reiner On The Magic Of Belle Isle And 'Living Your Life Until You Can't' |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date= June 23, 2012|accessdate=October 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"We're not equal? How are we not equal?" Rob Reiner on Real Time with Bill Maher, in response to Maher's statement, "I would argue atheists are [not considered equal under the law]". Maher then stated, "For a group that is about 17 percent now... no representation in congress..." to which Reiner replied, "You're right about that-that we don't have that representation. I include myself in that same 17 percent...." "Real Time with Bill Maher".&lt;/ref&gt;  Reiner later told Huffington Post contributor Debra Oliver that while he rejected organized religion, he was sympathetic to the ideas of [[Buddhism]].&lt;ref name=reinerbelief /&gt;

In addition to his four children, Reiner has five grandchildren, through his adopted daughter Tracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0718021/bio|title=Tracy Reiner|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Music ==
In 2016 Rapper [[Magneto Dayo]] paid homage to Reiner and his film ''Misery'' by releasing a song titled "[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NyA6p9Pm7E&amp;t=53s Misery (Tribute to Rob Reiner)]"
