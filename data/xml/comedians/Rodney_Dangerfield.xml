'''Rodney Dangerfield''' (born '''Jacob Rodney Cohen'''&lt;ref name="Dangerfield sweat" /&gt; November 22, 1921 – October 5, 2004) was an American [[stand-up comedian]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/26/magazine/letter-of-recommendation-rodney-dangerfield.html|title=Letter of Recommendation: Rodney Dangerfield|author=Halberstadt, Alex|date=January 26, 2018|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|accessdate=August 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; actor, voice artist, filmmaker, musician&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vulture.com/2014/05/dave-holmes-no-respect-rappin-rodney-1984-chart.html|title=Respect to ‘Rappin’ Rodney’ and 99 Other Hits From 1984|author=Holmes, Dave|date=May 29, 2014|publisher=''Vulture''|accessdate=August 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and author known for his self-deprecating [[one-line joke|one-liner]]s humor, his catchphrase "I don't get no respect!" and his [[monologue]]s on that theme.  

He began his career working as a stand-up comic in the [[Borscht Belt]] resorts of the [[Catskill Mountains]] north of New York City.  His act grew in notoriety as he became a mainstay on [[late-night talk show]]s throughout the 1960s and 1970s, eventually developing into a headlining act on the [[Las Vegas]] casino circuit.  A few bit-parts in films such as ''[[The Projectionist]]'' appeared throughout the 1970s, but his breakout film role came in 1980 as a boorish [[nouveau riche]] golfer in the ensemble comedy ''[[Caddyshack]]'', which was followed by two more successful films: 1983's ''[[Easy Money (1983 film)|Easy Money]]'' and 1986's ''[[Back to School]]''.  Additional film work kept him busy through the rest of his life, mostly in comedies, but with a rare dramatic role in 1994's ''[[Natural Born Killers]]'' as an abusive father.  Health troubles curtailed his output through the early 2000s before his death, in 2004, after a month in a coma due to complications from brain surgery.

==Early life==
Cohen was born in [[Babylon, New York|Babylon,]] in [[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk County]], [[Long Island]], New York.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/06/arts/06dangerfield.html?scp=4&amp;sq=%22rodney+dangerfield%22&amp;st=nyt "Rodney Dangerfield, Comic Seeking Respect, Dies at 82"] ''New York Times'' October 6, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; He was the son of Jewish parents, Dorothy "Dotty" (Teitelbaum) and the [[vaudeville|vaudevillian]] performer Phil Roy (Phillip Cohen). His mother was born in the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=NbaAF5Zwax0C&amp;pg=PT15&amp;dq=%22the+whole+family+had+come+to+america+from+hungary%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20whole%20family%20had%20come%20to%20america%20from%20hungary%22&amp;f=false |title=It's not easy bein' me: a lifetime of no respect but plenty of sex and drugs |publisher=Books.google.com |date=2005 |accessdate=18 July 2016|isbn=9780061957642 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cohen's father was rarely home; he would normally see him only twice a year. Late in life, his father begged him for forgiveness, and the son obliged.&lt;ref name=DeseretNews&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=P-JYAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=QoQDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7165,5199161&amp;dq=rodney+dangerfield+father+was+never+home+he+was+out+looking+to+make+other+kids&amp;hl=en|title=Dangerfield: summer-film comet|date=August 26, 1986|publisher=''[[Deseret News]]''|accessdate=August 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Cohen's father abandoned the family, his mother moved him and his sister to [[Kew Gardens, Queens]], and he attended [[Richmond Hill High School (Queens, New York)|Richmond Hill High School]], where he graduated in 1939. To support himself and his family, he sold newspapers and ice cream at the beach, and delivered groceries.&lt;ref name=DeseretNews/&gt;

At the age of 15, he began to write for stand-up comedians while performing at a resort in [[Ellenville, New York]].&lt;ref name= silent&gt;{{cite news |title= That Laughter You Hear Is the Silent Majority |first= Albert |last= Goldman |work= The New York Times |date= June 14, 1970 |page= 111 |url= http://search.proquest.com/docview/118849740/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, at the age of 19 he legally changed his name to '''Jack Roy'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://movieactors.com/actors/rodneydangerfield.htm |title=Rodney Dangerfield|publisher=Movieactors.com |date= |accessdate=July 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= A "Born Loser" Who Gets Laughs |work= The Baltimore Sun |date= July 13, 1969 |page= TW6 |url= http://search.proquest.com/docview/539155980/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; He struggled financially for nine years, at one point performing as a singing waiter until he was fired. He also performed as an acrobatic diver before taking a job selling aluminum siding to support his wife and family. He later said that he was so little known when he gave up show business that, "at the time I quit, I was the only one who ''knew'' I quit!"

==Career==

===Early career===

In the early 1960s he started down what would be a long road toward rehabilitating his career as an entertainer, still working as a salesman by day. He divorced his first wife Joyce in 1961, and returned to the stage, performing at many hotels in the [[Catskill Mountains]], but still finding minimal success. He fell into debt (about $20,000 by his own estimate), and couldn't get booked. As he would later joke, "I played one club&amp;mdash;it was so far out, my act was reviewed in ''[[Field &amp; Stream]]''."&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/WolfFiles/story?id=96052&amp;page=1 "Rodney Dangerfield Remarries . . . And This Time He's Sober."] ABC News. August 24, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

He came to realize that what he lacked was an "image", a well-defined on-stage persona that audiences could relate to, one that would distinguish him from other comics. After being shunned by some premier comedy venues, he returned to the East Coast{{what?|date=August 2018}} where he began developing a character for whom nothing goes right.

He took the name '''Rodney Dangerfield''', which had been used as the comical name of a faux cowboy star by [[Jack Benny]] on his radio program at least as early as the December 21, 1941, broadcast, and later as a pseudonym by [[Ricky Nelson]] on the TV program ''[[The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet]]''. The Benny character, who also received little or no respect from the outside world, served as a great inspiration to Dangerfield while he was developing his own comedy character. The "Biography" program also tells of the time Benny visited Dangerfield backstage after one of his performances. During this visit Benny complimented him on developing such a wonderful comedy character and style. However, Jack Roy remained Dangerfield's legal name,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kapelovitz.com/dangerfield.htm|title=Clear and Present Dangerfield|author=Kapelovitz, Dan|publisher=''[[Hustler]]''|date=October 2004|accessdate=May 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; as he mentioned in several interviews. During a question-and-answer session with the audience on the album ''No Respect'', Dangerfield joked that his real name was Percival Sweetwater.

* “I went to the fights last night, and a hockey game broke out.”}}

On Sunday, March 5, 1967, ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' needed a last-minute replacement for another act,&lt;ref name="Edsullivan.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edsullivan.com/artists/rodney-dangerfield/ |title=Rodney Dangerfield &amp;#124; Ed Sullivan Show |publisher=Edsullivan.com |date=March 5, 1967 |accessdate=March 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Dangerfield became the surprise hit of the show.

Dangerfield began headlining shows in [[Las Vegas]] and continued making frequent appearances on ''The Ed Sullivan Show''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0040053/fullcredits#cast:imdb cast list for Ed Sullivan Show]&lt;/ref&gt; He also became a regular on ''[[The Dean Martin Show]]'' and appeared on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' a total of 35&amp;nbsp;times.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055708/fullcredits#cast:imdb episode guide for Tonight Show]&lt;/ref&gt; 
One of his quips as a standup comedian was, “I walked into a bar the other day and ordered a drink. The bartender says, ‘I can’t serve you.’ I said, ‘Why not? I'm over 21!’ He said, ‘You’re just too ugly.’ I said as always, ‘Boy I tell you, I get no respect around here’.” The “no respect” phrase would come to define his act in the years that followed.

In 1969, Rodney Dangerfield teamed up with longtime friend Anthony Bevacqua to build the [[Dangerfield's]] comedy club in New York City, a venue he could now perform in on a regular basis without having to constantly travel. The club became a huge success, and has been in continuous operation for nearly 50 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6187136/|title=Rodney Dangerfield dead at 82|agency=Associated Press|publisher=[[MSNBC.com]]|date=October 7, 2004|accessdate=September 14, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dangerfield’s was the venue for several [[HBO]] shows which helped popularize many stand-up comics, including [[Jerry Seinfeld]], [[Jim Carrey]], [[Tim Allen]], [[Roseanne Barr]], [[Robert Townsend (actor)|Robert Townsend]], [[Jeff Foxworthy]], [[Sam Kinison]], [[Bill Hicks]], [[Rita Rudner]], [[Andrew Dice Clay]], [[Louie Anderson]], [[Dom Irrera]], and [[Bob Saget]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

[[Image:Album no respect.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Rodney Dangerfield's 1980 comedy album ''No Respect''.]] His 1980 comedy album, ''No Respect'', won a [[Grammy Award]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grammy.com/nominees/search?artist=rodney+dangerfield&amp;field_nominee_work_value=&amp;year=1980&amp;genre=All&amp;=Search 23rd Annual Grammy Awards. Grammy.com]&lt;/ref&gt; One of his TV specials featured a musical number, “Rappin’ Rodney”, which would appear on his 1983 follow-up album, ''[[Rappin' Rodney (album)|Rappin' Rodney]]''. In December 1983, the “Rappin’ Rodney” single became one of the first Hot 100 rap records, and the associated video was an early [[MTV]] hit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fourthgradenothing.com/2011/08/rappin-rodney-dangerfield-no-respect-in_10.html |title=Rappin' Rodney Dangerfield - No Respect in 1983 |publisher=Fourth Grade Nothing |date=August 10, 2011 |accessdate=March 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video featured cameo appearances by [[Don Novello]] as a [[last rites]] priest munching on Rodney's [[last meal]] of fast food in a styrofoam container and [[Pat Benatar]] as a masked executioner pulling a [[hangman's knot]]. The two appear in a dream sequence where Dangerfield is condemned to die and does not get any respect, even in Heaven, as the gates close without his being permitted to enter.

===Career peak===
Though his acting career had begun much earlier in obscure movies like ''[[The Projectionist]]'' (1971),&lt;ref name= silent/&gt; Dangerfield's career peaked during the early 1980s, when he began acting in hit comedy movies.

One of Dangerfield's more memorable performances was in the 1980 golf comedy ''[[Caddyshack]]'', in which he played an obnoxious [[nouveau riche]] property developer who was a guest at a golf club, where he clashed with the uptight Judge Elihu Smails (played by [[Ted Knight]]). His role was initially smaller, but because he and fellow cast members [[Chevy Chase]] and [[Bill Murray]] proved adept at improvisation, their roles were greatly expanded during filming (much to the chagrin of some of their castmates).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biography.com/listings/episode_details.do?episodeid=510360&amp;airingid=511286 ''Caddyshack: The Inside Story''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610130346/http://www.biography.com/listings/episode_details.do?episodeid=510360&amp;airingid=511286 |date=2011-06-10 }}, Bio.HD December 13, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; His appearance in ''[[Caddyshack]]'' led to starring roles in ''[[Easy Money (1983 film)|Easy Money]]'' and ''[[Back To School]]''. Unlike his stand-up persona, his comedy film characters were portrayed as successful and generally popular—if still loud, brash and detested by the wealthy elite.

Throughout the 1980s, Dangerfield also appeared in a series of commercials for [[Miller Lite]] beer, including one in which various celebrities who had appeared in the ads were holding a bowling match. With the score tied, after a bearded [[Ben Davidson]] told Rodney, "All we need is one pin, Rodney", Dangerfield's ball went down the lane and bounced perpendicularly off the head pin, landing in the gutter without knocking down any of the pins.

In a change of pace from the comedy persona that made him famous, he played an [[child abuse|abusive]] father in ''[[Natural Born Killers]]'' in a scene for which he wrote or rewrote all of his own lines.&lt;ref&gt;De Vries, Hilary. [http://articles.latimes.com/1994-08-21/entertainment/ca-29578_1_natural-born-killers "Natural Born Actor : Comic titan Rodney Dangerfield is getting respect for his performance as a hateful dad in 'Natural Born Killers.'"] ''L.A. Times''. August 21, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dangerfield was rejected for membership in the [[Motion Picture Academy]] in 1995 by the head of the Academy's Actors Section, [[Roddy McDowall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/10/06/1096949552940.html?from=storyrhs | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Dangerfield dies | date=October 6, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; After fan protests, the Academy reconsidered, but Dangerfield then refused to accept membership.

Dangerfield appeared in an episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]'' titled "[[Burns, Baby Burns]]", in which he played a character who is essentially a parody of his own persona, [[Montgomery Burns|Mr. Burns]]'s son [[Larry Burns (The Simpsons)|Larry Burns]]. He also appeared as himself in an episode of ''[[Home Improvement (TV series)|Home Improvement]]''.

Dangerfield also appeared in the 2000 [[Adam Sandler]] film ''[[Little Nicky]]'', playing [[Lucifer]], the father of [[Satan]] ([[Harvey Keitel]]) and grandfather of Nicky (Sandler).

He was recognized by the [[Smithsonian Institution]], which put one of his trademark white shirts and red ties on display. When he handed the shirt to the museum's curator, Rodney joked, "I have a feeling you're going to use this to clean [[Charles Lindbergh|Lindbergh's]] plane."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1356&amp;dat=19820429&amp;id=kLRPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=LwYEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6577,8156255 |title=AP news report in the '&amp;#39;Ocala Star-Banner,'&amp;#39; April 29, 1982 |publisher=News.google.com |date= |accessdate=July 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dangerfield played an important role in comedian [[Jim Carrey]]'s rise to stardom. In the 1980s, after watching Carrey perform at the [[Comedy Store]] in Los Angeles, Rodney signed Carrey to open for Dangerfield's Las Vegas show. The two would tour together for about two more years.&lt;ref&gt;Jim Carrey's foreword in ''It's Not Easy Bein' Me: A Lifetime of No Respect But Plenty of Sex and Drugs'' by Rodney Dangerfield. (c) 2004, HarperCollins Publishers.[https://books.google.com/books?id=W2hHyD0oOWYC&amp;pg=PR11&amp;lpg=PR11&amp;dq=rodney+dangerfield+smithsonian&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=CqnPqz-eSE&amp;sig=zl7Q68-DbDFyg9PRU_fAuitIvPs&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=I0pmTvCbLcbC0AHzqa27Cg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=rodney%20dangerfield%20smithsonian&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Dangerfield was married twice to Joyce Indig. Together, the couple had two children: son Brian Roy (born 1949) and daughter Melanie Roy-Friedman.  From 1993 until his death, he was married to Joan Child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pearlman|first1=Jeff|title=The Tears of a Clown|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A10466-2004Jul23.html|accessdate=May 14, 2016|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=July 24, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, Rodney shared an apartment on [[Manhattan's Upper East Side]] with a housekeeper, his poodle, Keno, and his closest friend of 30 years, Joe Ancis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Durkee|first=Culter|title=Rodney Dangerfield Has Known Worse—It's Usually An Albatross|date=October 6, 1980|publisher=''[[People (magazine)]]''|url=http://people.com/archive/rodney-dangerfield-has-known-worse-its-usually-an-albatross-vol-14-no-14|accessdate=August 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joe was also friend of and major influence on [[Lenny Bruce]], and was a surrealistically fast and funny man who could never perform in front of strangers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fong-Torres|first=Ben|title=Rodney Dangerfield: He Whines That We May Laugh|date=September 18, 1980|publisher=''[[Rolling Stone]]''|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/features/rodney-dangerfield-he-whines-that-we-may-laugh-19800918|accessdate=August 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dangerfield resented being confused with his on-stage persona. Although his wife Joan described him as "classy, gentlemanly, sensitive and intelligent,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/_/id/6054693/rodneydangerfield?pageid=rs.Artistcage&amp;pageregion=triple3&amp;rnd=1096316510181&amp;has-player=true|title=Gone to Pot|author=Hedegaard, Erik|publisher=''[[Rolling Stone]]''|date=May 19, 2004|accessdate=May 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was often treated like the loser he played. In his 2004 autobiography, ''It's Not Easy Bein' Me: A Lifetime of No Respect but Plenty of Sex and Drugs'' ({{ISBN|0-06-621107-7}}), which was released posthumously, he discussed being a longtime [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] smoker. The book's original title was ''My Love Affair With Marijuana''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20040718/news_1a18rodney.html |title=Dangerfield is no laughing matter|publisher=''[[The San Diego Union-Tribune]]'' |date=July 18, 2004 |last=Pearlman |first=Jeff |accessdate=September 14, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dangerfield, while Jewish, referred to himself as an atheist during an interview with Howard Stern on May 25, 2004. Dangerfield added that he was a "logical" atheist.&lt;ref&gt;https://ffrf.org/news/day/dayitems/item/14909-rodney-dangerfield- Dangerfield said he was an atheist during an interview with [[Howard Stern]] in May 2004. Stern asked Dangerfield if he believed in an afterlife. Dangerfield answered he was a "logical" atheist and added, "We're apes––do apes go anyplace?"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years and death==
[[File:RodneyDangerfieldGravestoneJuly2007.jpg|thumb|right|Dangerfield's headstone at [[Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery]]]]
On November 22, 2001 (his 80th birthday), Dangerfield suffered a mild heart attack while backstage at the ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno|Tonight Show]]''. During Dangerfield's hospital stay, the staff were reportedly upset that he smoked [[marijuana]] in his room.&lt;ref name=Brownfield&gt;{{cite news|title=Comic genius Dangerfield still cutting jokes to thwart boredom|first=Paul |last=Brownfield |agency=Los Angeles Times|work=Journal - Gazette|location=Ft. Wayne, Ind.|date=December 21, 2002|page=3.D}}&lt;/ref&gt; But he was back at the ''Tonight Show'' a year later, performing on his 81st birthday.&lt;ref name=Brownfield/&gt;

On April 8, 2003, Dangerfield underwent [[Neurosurgery|brain surgery]] to improve blood flow in preparation for [[heart valve]]-replacement surgery on a later date.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eonline.com/news/44934/dangerfield-undergoes-brain-surgery&lt;/ref&gt; The surgery took place on August 24, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.foxnews.com/story/2004/08/25/rodney-dangerfield-to-have-heart-surgery.html&lt;/ref&gt; Upon entering the hospital, he uttered another characteristic one-liner when asked how long he would be hospitalized: "If all goes well, about a week. If not, about an hour and a half."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=07SShhi-hHcC&amp;pg=PT501&amp;lpg=PT501|title= Funniest Thing You Never Said 2|editor=Rosemarie Jarski|publisher=Ebury Press|year=2010|page=501|isbn= 978-0091924515}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2004, it was revealed that Dangerfield had been in a [[coma]] for several weeks. Afterward, he began breathing on his own and showing signs of awareness when visited by friends, however, he died on October 5, 2004 at the [[UCLA Medical Center]], a month and a half shy of his 83rd birthday, from complications of the surgery he had undergone in August. Dangerfield was interred in the [[Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery]] in Los Angeles. His headstone reads, "Rodney Dangerfield... There goes the neighborhood."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gary Wayne |url=http://www.seeing-stars.com/ImagePages/RodneyDangerfieldGravePhoto.shtml |title=Rodney Dangerfield's grave (photo) |publisher=Seeing-stars.com |date= |accessdate=March 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Joan Child held an event in which the word "respect" had been emblazoned in the sky, while each guest was given a live [[monarch butterfly]] for a butterfly-release ceremony led by [[Farrah Fawcett]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rodney.com/rodney/about/about.asp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202115106/http://www.rodney.com/rodney/about/about.asp|archivedate=February 2, 2009|title=Rodney's Bio|website=rodney.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
[[UCLA]]’s Division of [[Neurosurgery]] named a suite of operating rooms after him and gave him the “Rodney  Respect Award”, which his widow presented to [[Jay Leno]] on October 20, 2005. It was presented on behalf of the [[David Geffen School of Medicine]]/Division of Neurosurgery at [[UCLA]] at their 2005 Visionary Ball.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press_release | url=http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/article/7483:University | title=Neurosurgery Division to Present Jay Leno With Rodney Dangerfield Legacy Aw | publisher=[[Regents of the University of California]] | date=September 14, 2005 | accessdate=November 1, 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305184848/http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/article/7483:University | archive-date=March 5, 2012 | dead-url=yes | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other recipients of the “Rodney  Respect Award” include [[Tim Allen]] (2007),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= https://variety.com/2007/voices/columns/rodneys-respect-726/ | title=Rodney's Respected by Tim | date=September 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jim Carrey]] (2009), [[Louie Anderson]] (2010),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-504660 | work=CNN | title=Louie Anderson Illuminates The Night | date=October 19, 2010 | access-date=November 5, 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219210425/http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-504660 | archive-date=February 19, 2015 | dead-url=yes | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bob Saget]] (2011), and [[Chelsea Handler]] (2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.bennettawards.com/project-highlights/2014/5/16/comedian-chelsea-handler-receives-bennett-custom-recognition-award | work=Bennett Awards | title=Comedian Chelsea Handler Receives Bennett Custom Recognition Award | date=February 26, 2013 | access-date=June 25, 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151006031822/http://www.bennettawards.com/project-highlights/2014/5/16/comedian-chelsea-handler-receives-bennett-custom-recognition-award | archive-date=October 6, 2015 | dead-url=yes | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his memory, ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' ran a short sketch of Dangerfield (played by [[Darrell Hammond]]) at the gates of heaven. [[Saint Peter]] mentions that he heard Dangerfield got no respect in life, which prompts Dangerfield to spew an entire string of his famous one-liners. After he’s done, he asks why Saint Peter was so interested. Saint Peter replies, “I just wanted to hear those jokes one more time” and waves him into heaven, prompting Dangerfield to joyfully declare: “Finally! A little respect!”&lt;ref&gt;http://snltranscripts.jt.org/04/04bdangerfield.phtml&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 10, 2006, [[Comedy Central]]’s ''Legends: Rodney Dangerfield'' commemorated his life and legacy. Featured comedians included [[Adam Sandler]], [[Chris Rock]], [[Jay Leno]], [[Ray Romano]], [[Roseanne Barr]], [[Jerry Seinfeld]], [[Bob Saget]], [[Jerry Stiller]], [[Kevin Kline]] and [[Jeff Foxworthy]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0865327/ reference to Legends: Rodney Dangerfield]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, a Rodney Dangerfield tattoo was among the most popular celebrity tattoos in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/23/opinion/23chen.html |title=Op-Art: All the Body's a Stage |last1=Chen |first1=Perry |last2=Yael |first2=Aviva |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=February 23, 2007 |accessdate=May 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'', May 29, 2009, Leno credited Dangerfield with popularizing the style of joke he had long been using. The format of the joke is that the comedian tells a sidekick how bad something is, and the sidekick&amp;mdash;in this case, guitar player [[Kevin Eubanks]]&amp;mdash;sets up the joke by asking just how bad that something is.&lt;ref&gt;“The Tonight Show with Jay Leno”, New York: National Broadcasting Company, May 29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2017, Dangerfield’s widow expressed disappointment with a mural that had been painted of Dangerfield in Kew Gardens, his old Queens neighborhood, about a year earlier.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20170303123641/http://abcnews.go.com/Weird/wireStory/widow-mural-rodney-dangerfield-flattering-45839505 Widow: Mural of Rodney Dangerfield is ‘less-than-flattering’] &lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning on June 12, 2017, Los Angeles City College Theatre Academy hosted the first class of The Rodney Dangerfield Institute of Comedy. The class is a stand-up comedy class which is taught by comedienne Joanie Willgues, aka Joanie Coyote.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lacitycollege.edu/academic/rodneydangerfield.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailynews.com/social-affairs/20170531/la-city-college-giving-comic-respect-with-rodney-dangerfield-institute&lt;/ref&gt;
