'''Hannah Maud Hart''' (born November 2, 1986) is an American internet personality, comedian, author, and actress. She is best known for starring in ''[[My Drunk Kitchen]]'', a weekly series on [[YouTube]] in which she cooks something while [[Alcohol intoxication|intoxicated]]. Apart from her main channel, she also runs a second channel where she talks about life in general and gives her opinions on various topics. She co-produced and starred in the independent comedy film ''[[Camp Takota]]'', released in 2014. She wrote a parody cookbook which was a ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' bestseller for five weeks in August–September 2014.

==Early life==
Hart's mother suffers from [[psychosis]], and her childhood home was inspected for human habitation acceptability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Effron|first1=Lauren|title=Hannah Hart of 'My Drunk Kitchen' fame turned to meditation while helping mentally ill mother find care|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/hannah-hart-drunk-kitchen-fame-turned-meditation-helping/story?id=45516583|accessdate=September 20, 2017|work=ABC News|date=February 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has an older sister named Naomi and a younger half-sister named Maggie. After graduating from Burlingame High School, she briefly lived in Japan in the fall of 2006, before returning home. Hart attended the [[University of California, Berkeley]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.berkeley.edu/index.html ''Alumni list''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130213010629/http://berkeley.edu/index.html |date=February 13, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and graduated in May 2009 with two degrees; one in English literature and one in Japanese language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axCTyBauooQ&amp;NR=1 |title=26 Questions for 26th Birthday! |publisher=YouTube |work=MyHarto |date=November 2, 2012 |accessdate=May 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon her graduation, Hart moved to [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]], to pursue a writing career. She ended up proofreading Japanese and English for a [[Manhattan]] based translating firm instead of her initial dream of writing screenplays.&lt;ref name="verge"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Tiffany |first1=Kaitlyn |title=My Drunk Kitchen creator Hannah Hart on life as a YouTube star |url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/19/13315924/hannah-hart-interview-youtube-buffering-my-drunk-kitchen |website=The Verge |accessdate=21 July 2018 |date=19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within two months of launching her YouTube channel, she had become a YouTube partner and ended up quitting her 9–5 job in order to focus on ''My Drunk Kitchen''.&lt;ref name="verge" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Megan O'Neill|url=http://socialtimes.com/hannah-hart-interview_b63668|title=How Hannah Hart Turned Drunk Cooking Into A YouTube Partnership [Interview]|publisher=''Social Times''|date=May 24, 2011|accessdate=May 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===''My Drunk Kitchen''===
''[[My Drunk Kitchen]]'' traces its beginning to March 2011, when Hart was at her sister's home, chatting with a friend over webcam. Hart used her Macintosh computer to record herself drinking wine while attempting to make a grilled cheese sandwich without any cheese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Suddath|first=Claire|url=http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,2079263,00.html|title=The Pleasures of Cooking While Drunk with Hannah Hart|publisher=''Time''|date=June 22, 2011|accessdate=June 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hart uploaded the video to [[YouTube]] as ''My Drunk Kitchen''.&lt;ref name="verge" /&gt; Within a few days the video had accumulated 100,000 hits. Viewers began asking for another "episode" of the video, and Hart complied with more recordings. To establish the initial upload as the first episode of a series, she renamed it "Butter Yo Shit."&lt;ref name="EarBiscuits2013"&gt;{{cite web|author=Rhett and Link|title=Ep. 5 Hannah Hart - Ear Biscuits|url=https://soundcloud.com/earbiscuits/ep-5-hannah-hart-ear-biscuits|publisher=SoundCloud|date=October 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; By July 2011, ''My Drunk Kitchen'' had gathered 800,000 hits, earning Hart a YouTube partnership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pesce|first=Nicole Lyn|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/drunk-kitchen-star-youtube-sensation-hannah-hart-dishes-cook-inebriated-article-1.156736|title='My Drunk Kitchen' star and YouTube sensation Hannah Hart dishes on what to cook while inebriated|publisher=''The New York Daily Times''|date=July 10, 2011|accessdate=June 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hart has hosted several celebrity guests on ''My Drunk Kitchen'', including British chef [[Jamie Oliver]],&lt;ref name="Rashkin2014"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.laweekly.com/squidink/2014/09/02/hannah-harts-my-drunk-kitchen-is-a-fun-place-to-visit-but-dont-eat-the-food |title=Hannah Hart's ''My Drunk Kitchen'' Is a Fun Place to Visit but Don't Eat the Food |last=Rashkin |first=Sara |date=September 2, 2014 |journal=LA Weekly }}&lt;/ref&gt; actress [[Mary-Louise Parker]], actor/host [[Chris Hardwick]], video blogger [[Tyler Oakley]], former [[NSYNC]] member [[Lance Bass]], and author [[John Green (author)|John Green]], who subsequently wrote the foreword to Hart's cookbook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gallucci|first=Kelly|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/books/2014/09/18/my-drunk-kitchen-book-hannah-hart/15828961/|title=My sober interview: Hannah Hart on drunk authors|publisher=''USA Today''|date=September 18, 2014 |accessdate=June 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comedian [[Sarah Silverman]] was also featured in the show in December 2014 in an episode which demonstrated the therapeutic and medicinal use of [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Watson|first=Meg|url=http://junkee.com/sarah-silverman-just-brought-weed-into-my-drunk-kitchen-and-the-results-are-glorious/46767|title=Sarah Silverman Just Brought Weed Into ‘My Drunk Kitchen’ And The Results Are Glorious|publisher=Sound Alliance|work=Junkee|date=December 7, 2014|accessdate=June 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New episodes of ''My Drunk Kitchen'' are uploaded each Thursday on Hart's main channel. In 2013 at the [[3rd Streamy Awards]], Hart won the [[Streamy Award]] for Best Female Performance in a Comedy.&lt;ref name=3streamys&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.streamys.org/nominees-winners/3rd-annual-nominees/ |title=3rd Annual Winners &amp; Nominees|work=Streamy Awards|accessdate=February 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Hart co-hosted the [[4th Streamy Awards]] with her colleague [[Grace Helbig]].&lt;ref name="Cresci2014"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cresci|first=Elena|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/sep/08/the-streamys-2014-10-of-the-best-winners-from-the-online-video-awards|title=The Streamys 2014: 10 of the best winners from the online video awards|publisher=''The Guardian''|date=September 8, 2014|accessdate=June 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''My Drunk Kitchen'' would also would win the presentation's award for best comedy.&lt;ref name="Cresci2014" /&gt;

By April 2015, Hart's first episode "Butter Yo Shit" had 3.6 million hits.&lt;ref name="Eber2014"&gt;{{cite web|last=Eber|first=Hailey|url=https://nypost.com/2014/08/10/comedian-hannah-hart-turns-boozy-night-into-cooking-show/|title=Comedian Hannah Hart turns boozy night into cooking show|publisher=''New York Post''|date=August 10, 2014|accessdate=June 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of June 2015, her channel ''MyHarto'' had over 2.3 million subscribers and over 206 million views.&lt;ref name="Alejandrino2014"&gt;{{cite web|last=Alejandrino|first=Rosemarie|url=http://www.dailycal.org/2014/08/14/getting-drunk-happens-best-us-proves-berkeley-alum-hannah-hart/|title=Getting drunk?

===''Hello Harto: The Tour Show''===
On January 2, 2013, Hannah posted a video on YouTube stating that she was considering doing a world tour. She launched a campaign to fund this trip on [[Indiegogo]], aiming to get $50,000 within a month. After a couple of hours, the $50,000 goal was already met. Hart decided to keep the funding going to her initial end date of February 2, 2013. Depending on the final amount of money, the tour would be expanded to Canada, Europe and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/hello-harto?c=home|title=HELLO, HARTO! – Indiegogo campaign page|publisher=''Indiegogo''|accessdate=June 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By February 2, she had raised over $220,000. The first leg of the tour kicked off in April 2013.

''Hello Harto: The Tour Show'' consists of three parts: vlog, travel, and kitchen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsnWERN267I|title=HELLO, HARTO! (Ep. 1) - Leaving Los Angeles|publisher=YouTube|work=MyHarto|date=April 23, 2013|accessdate=June 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hart uploads various videos about her traveling experience on her second YouTube channel, YourHarto. The vlog (a recap of the city she is in) gets uploaded each Tuesday to her main channel, MyHarto. The kitchen episodes, which she films at a host's house in the city she visits, are uploaded on Thursday, also to her main channel.
The team consists of four people; Hannah Hart (host), Pearl Wible (producer), Sam Molleur (director) and Nick Underwood (RV driver). The theme song for the tour, written by Hart, was accompanied by a video of fans jaunting in front of their favorite places. The song is called "Don't Wait To Say Hello".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPWZQTKzJsM|title="Don't Wait to Say Hello" - music video|publisher=YouTube|work=MyHarto|date=April 18, 2013|accessdate=June 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After receiving negative feedback from a minority of fans that complained about the lack of places at the meet-ups, Hannah uploaded a video called ''The Real Hello Harto'' on her main channel, giving her fans an exclusive look behind the screens of a regular day on the Hello Harto tour. The video explained the work that goes into making content videos, as well shooting ''My Drunk Kitchen'' videos and meeting up with fans all over Canada and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1XRx1RvkvY|title=The Real HELLO, HARTO|publisher=YouTube|work=MyHarto|date=June 4, 2013|accessdate=June 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2014, Hart started uploading more episodes of her travel show in Australia and New Zealand. These episodes were from a trip she took almost a year before that was sponsored by [[Contiki Tours|Contiki]], along with other content creators.

===''No Filter''===
[[File:Mamrie Hart and Hannah Hart at No Filter in December 2013.jpg|thumb|[[Mamrie Hart]] (no relation) and Hannah Hart onstage at ''No Filter'' in December 2013, held in Portland, Oregon]]
On February 2, 2013, Hannah Hart performed a comedy show in collaboration with best friends [[Grace Helbig]] and [[Mamrie Hart]] (no relation) at the NerdMelt, [[Los Angeles]]. The audience was encouraged to tape the show on their cameras and phones, and upload it to social media websites with the tag #NoFilterShow. The show quickly gained popularity through [[Tumblr]] and [[YouTube]]. The 75-minute show was performed a second time at [[PlayList Live]] in March 2013. By this time, fans were generally demanding the show to go on tour - the trio decided to take ''#NoFilterShow'' on the road, syncing the tour dates with Hannah's ''Hello Harto''.&lt;ref name=Zaino2013&gt;{{cite web|last=Zaino III|first=Nick A.|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/2013/05/23/with-daily-grace-videos-comedian-grace-helbig-builds-fan-base-online/ntPCVNQ4X4WG0SrkjFNCvK/story.html|title=With ‘Daily Grace’ videos, comedian Grace Helbig builds a fan base|publisher=''The Boston Globe''|date=May 23, 2013|accessdate=June 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The #NoFilterShow returned for multiple more legs of shows, in August, October, and November 2014 and again in summer 2015. The show also ventured overseas to [[London]] and [[Dublin]].

===''Camp Takota''===
On August 2, 2013 Hart announced on the main stage at [[VidCon]] 2013 that she would be starring in her first feature film alongside friends [[Grace Helbig]] and [[Mamrie Hart]] (no relation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gutelle |first=Sam |url=http://www.tubefilter.com/2013/08/02/grace-helbig-hannah-mamrie-hart-chill-camp-takota/ |title=Grace Helbig, Hannah Hart, Mamrie Hart to Chill at 'Camp Takota' |publisher=Tubefilter.com |date=August 2, 2013 |accessdate=September 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The comedy film ''[[Camp Takota]]'' follows Elise (played by Grace) as a young woman who is forced to leave her big city job and head back to her old summer camp where she is reunited with old friends Allison (played by Hannah) and Maxine (played by Mamrie).&lt;ref name=Goldstein2014&gt;{{cite web|last=Goldstein|first=Rich|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/02/12/youtube-s-holy-trinity-goes-to-camp-takota.html|title=YouTube’s Holy Trinity Goes to ‘Camp Takota’|publisher=''The Daily Beast''|date=February 12, 2014|accessdate=June 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film, directed by Chris and Nick Riedell, began shooting in California on August 12, 2013.&lt;ref name=Goldstein2014 /&gt; Michael Goldfine of Rockstream Studios produced the film along with eight others including Hart, Helbig and Mamrie who served as executive producers.&lt;ref name=Goldstein2014/&gt; The film's official [[trailer (promotion)|trailer]] was released on December 24, 2013.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://camptakota.com/ |title=Camp Takota |publisher=Camp Takota |date=February 14, 2014 |accessdate=March 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Camp Takota'' was released via digital download on the movie's [http://camptakota.com website] on February 14, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWdvXeBk3-U#t=78 |title=Camp Takota Trailer: Redux |publisher=YouTube |date=January 14, 2014 |accessdate=March 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Netflix]] picked up the movie to be streamed on their platform on December 1, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2014/digital/news/netflix-picks-up-camp-takota-from-youtube-stars-grace-helbig-mamrie-hart-and-hannah-hart-1201364772/|title=Netflix Picks Up ‘Camp Takota’ from YouTube Stars Grace Helbig, Mamrie Hart and Hannah Hart|last=Spangler|first=Todd|date=November 25, 2014|work=Variety|access-date=February 19, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parody cookbook===
In August 2014, Hart released her first parody self-help book, a companion volume to ''My Drunk Kitchen''. The book was titled ''My Drunk Kitchen: A Guide to Eating, Drinking, and Going with Your Gut''. Hart described it as "self-help parody-meets-drunk cooking".&lt;ref name=Eber2014/&gt; The cookbook entered the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' bestsellers list at No. 6 in the "Advice, How-To &amp; Miscellaneous" category, and stayed on it for two more weeks in August 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/2014-08-31/advice-how-to-and-miscellaneous/list.html?date=2014-08-31&amp;category=advice-how-to-and-miscellaneous&amp;pagewanted=print|title=Best Sellers: Advice, How-To &amp; Miscellaneous|work=The New York Times Book Review|date=August 31, 2014|accessdate=September 21, 2014}} No. 6 ranking based on sales up to August 16, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/2014-09-07/advice-how-to-and-miscellaneous/list.html?date=2014-09-07&amp;category=advice-how-to-and-miscellaneous&amp;pagewanted=print |title=Best Sellers: Advice, How-To &amp; Miscellaneous |date=September 7, 2014 |work=The New York Times Book Review |accessdate=September 21, 2014}} No. 10 ranking based on sales up to August 23, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/2014-09-14/advice-how-to-and-miscellaneous/list.html?date=2014-09-14&amp;category=advice-how-to-and-miscellaneous&amp;pagewanted=print |title=Best Sellers: Advice, How-To &amp; Miscellaneous |date=September 14, 2014 |work=The New York Times Book Review |accessdate=September 21, 2014}} No. 18 ranking based on sales up to August 30, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' recognized the book as rising to No. 3 on their hardcover nonfiction list, opining that the book was not so much a cookbook as a pep talk for friends, a self-help book. Author [[John Green (author)|John Green]] wrote the foreword, saying, "I defy anyone to read this surprisingly useful book and not come away from it madly in love with [Hart]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/print/20140825/63768-this-week-s-bestsellers-august-25-2014.html |title=This Week's Bestsellers: August 25, 2014 – Drinking and Thriving |date=August 22, 2014 |journal=Publishers Weekly |volume=261 |number=34 |last=Juris |first=Carolyn }}&lt;/ref&gt;
