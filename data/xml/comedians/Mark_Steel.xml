'''Mark Steel''' (born 4 July 1960) is an English comedian, broadcaster, newspaper columnist and author.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/question_time/1871308.stm |title=Question Time |publisher=BBC |accessdate=18 June 2013 |date=29 March 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Stand-up comedy|stand-up comedian]] known for his left-wing beliefs (he was a long-standing member of the [[Socialist Workers Party (UK)|Socialist Workers Party]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/question_time/1871308.stm | work=BBC News | title=Last week's panel | date=29 March 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; he has made many appearances on radio and television shows as a guest panellist, and has written regular columns in ''[[The Guardian]]'' and ''[[The Independent]]''. He is perhaps best known for presenting ''[[The Mark Steel Lectures]]'', ''[[The Mark Steel Revolution]]'', ''[[The Mark Steel Solution]]'' and ''[[Mark Steel's in Town]]''.

==Early life==
Steel was adopted 10 days after he was born.&lt;ref name="Wade"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wade|first=Michael|title=The week with George Galloway - Nov 4|url=http://talksport.com/radio/week-george-galloway/blog/2011-11-07/week-george-galloway-nov-4|publisher=[[Talksport]]|date= 7 November 2011|accessdate=24 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His adoptive father worked in insurance and his mother was a housewife who supplemented the family's income through factory work and working as a [[lollipop lady]].&lt;ref name=graun&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/27/mark-steel-finding-out-who-i-am |title=Mark Steel: Finding out who I am |last1=Lee|first1=Veronica|date=27 June 2015 |work=The Guardian|access-date=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had a close relationship with his adoptive parents.&lt;ref name=rtbc/&gt; Steel later told UK newspaper ''[[The Guardian]]'''s Veronica Lee: &lt;blockquote&gt;"I knew I was adopted, strangely, before I knew where babies came from. I didn’t feel different or special, and I don’t ever remember giving the slightest damn about it. I knew because my very lovely auntie Gwen would tell the story of how she got talking to a blonde girl, Frances, who had moved into a flat in the same house in London. She was 19. She was in a bit of a state because she was pregnant. Her parents didn’t know and she’d run away from home. It was 1959, so this wasn’t easy to deal with. So my auntie Gwen said to her, ‘Well, I’ve got a solution. Have the baby and give it to my brother.’ So this girl had me in 1960 and I was handed over to Doreen and Ernie."&lt;ref name="graun"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He grew up in [[Swanley]], Kent. Steel claims that he was expelled from school for attending a cricket course without permission: "I thought, fantastic! The punishment for not coming in is that I'm not allowed to come in".&lt;ref name="Nottingham Post 15 August 2008"&gt;{{cite web | author= This is Nottingham | title= COMEDY: Mark Steel | url= http://www.nottinghampost.com/COMEDY-Mark-Steel/story-12218102-detail/story.html | date= 15 August 2008 | newspaper= [[Nottingham Post]] | location= Nottingham | accessdate= 24 May 2016 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170205010601/http://www.nottinghampost.com/comedy-mark-steel/story-12218102-detail/story.html | archivedate= 5 February 2017 | df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He traced his biological mother later in life but she said that she did not want to know him.&lt;ref name="Wade"/&gt; She died soon after Steel attempted to contact her. He learned that she was from a Scottish working-class family with an active involvement in left-wing politics, and that she had subsequently married an Italian and lived in [[Rimini]]. She had met his biological father Joe Dwek&lt;ref name=BBCR4&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Steel, Mark |date=9 December 2017 |title=Mark Steel - Who Do I Think I Am? |trans-title= |medium=BBC Radio 4 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b08drbx2 |access-date=9 December 2017 |publisher=BBC }}&lt;/ref&gt; at a party in London. Dwek was an Egyptian [[Sephardic Jew]] whose family left Egypt after [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] became president in the 1950s. Dwek had subsequently become a multi-millionaire trader on [[Wall Street]], as well as a successful professional [[backgammon]] player and the [[List of World Backgammon champions|1976 World Backgammon champion]].&lt;ref name=graun /&gt;&lt;ref name=BBCR4 /&gt; He met Dwek only once, around 2006, after writing and emailing him, and arranging to meet in a London restaurant.&lt;ref name=BBCR4 /&gt; In 2015, Steel told ''The Guardian'''s Lee: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Members of the royal family used to visit his house in London and he hung out with millionaires, like [[John Aspinall (zoo owner)|John Aspinall]] and [[James Goldsmith]], at the [[John Aspinall (zoo owner)#Clermont Club|Clermont Club]] [...] Just last night I discovered that five years ago he bought a house for $12m. […] He said he remembered Frances vividly but it [Steel getting in touch by email] was all a bit of a shock because he had made all the arrangements to have me dispensed with. But she took the money and didn't go through with it, bless her."&lt;ref name="graun"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the late 1970s his adoptive father suffered a [[mental breakdown]] and was placed into care at [[Stone House Hospital]]. Steel says that his first encounter with social injustice was when he saw how mentally ill patients were being treated in that hospital. The shabby conditions of the home reinforced Steel's political beliefs.&lt;ref name="rtbc"&gt;{{cite book|last=Steel|first=Mark |title= Reasons to be Cheerful|publisher=Scribner UK|year=2001|isbn=0-7432-0804-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Steel has given varying accounts of his early career:&lt;ref name="Nottingham Post 15 August 2008"/&gt; He became bored with constantly being asked how he had started in comedy and took to telling the questioner the first thing that came into his head. He is often described as having worked as a television repair man&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Open2.net: How did you get into comedy? | date= | publisher= | url =http://www.open2.net/marksteel/o2interview.htm | work =Open University | pages = | accessdate = 2008-10-18 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; but confesses that he has no technical ability whatsoever. He worked the comedy circuit for several years, and has acknowledged that his comedic influences included [[Alexei Sayle]].&lt;ref name="Nottingham Post 15 August 2008"/&gt; In 1992 Steel presented a satirical radio show ''[[The Mark Steel Solution]]'' on [[BBC Radio 5 (former)|BBC Radio 5]], consisting of half-hour monologues which offered solutions to social problems.  It ran to four series. ''It's Not a Runner Bean'', a comic autobiography, was published in 1996, and this led to a column in ''[[The Guardian]]'' which appeared between 1996 and 1999. According to Steel he was sacked because the newspaper wanted to "realign towards Tony Blair", though ''The Guardian'' denied this. In 2000 he started writing a weekly column for ''[[The Independent]]'', which appears in the Wednesday Opinion Column.

He has written and performed several radio and television series for the [[BBC]], and authored several books.

In 2005 he toured the UK and Ireland, where he discussed the [[French revolution]] in a light-hearted style.

==Personal life==
Steel is a supporter of [[Crystal Palace F.C.]] and [[Kent County Cricket Club]] and enjoys watching both play on occasion. He was interviewed by Jonathan Agnew on [[Test Match Special]] during the South Africa series, giving an interview on his love of cricket.&lt;ref&gt;Interview on BBC's ''[[Test Match Special]]'', 1 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

He has a son, [[Elliot Steel]], and a daughter from a relationship that ended in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/love-sex/heartbreak/anatomy-of-a-breakup-939706.html|title=Anatomy of a break-up|date=24 September 2008|work=The Independent|accessdate=2009-03-31|location=London| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220230017/http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/love-sex/heartbreak/anatomy-of-a-breakup-939706.html| archivedate=20 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
During the [[premiership of Margaret Thatcher]], when he was in his 20s, Steel's objections to  society's injustices were vented by political protests, [[punk rock]] and poetry.

Viewing the [[Soviet Union]] as "sh*t", and as a [[state capitalism|state capitalist]] system rather than truly [[socialism|socialist]], Steel joined the [[Socialist Workers Party (UK)|Socialist Workers Party]] (SWP) instead of the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]].&lt;ref name="rtbc" /&gt; He supported strikes and demonstrations, and was present in Southall during the riot in which [[Death of Blair Peach|Blair Peach]] was killed. In the early 1980s he also persuaded his mother to allow striking steelworkers to spend a night in the Steel residence.&lt;ref name="rtbc" /&gt; By the end of the 1980s, he had moved into a [[Squatting|squat]] with his old friend Mick Hannan, before taking up residence in a flat.&lt;ref name="rtbc" /&gt;

In 2000 Steel took part in the [[London Assembly]] elections&lt;ref name="Independent author profile"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/author/mark-steel|title= Authors: Mark Steel  |author= &lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; | work= [[The Independent]] |publisher= | accessdate= 24 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; on behalf of the [[London Socialist Alliance]] (part of the [[Socialist Alliance (England)|Socialist Alliance]]) in the [[Croydon and Sutton (London Assembly constituency)|Croydon and Sutton constituency]]; he received 1,823 votes (1.5% of the vote).

In 2007 he left the SWP and justified his decision in his book ''What's Going On?'' In the book he wrote that he left the party because whilst the membership base had become smaller and smaller, the members who remained became increasingly deluded  regarding the size and relevance of the organisation. He also condemned the manner in which, at a time when there was broad public support for socialist ideals, increasingly bitter and futile in-fighting on the left made political success impossible.

[[Alex Callinicos]], International Secretary of the SWP, reviewed the book in the ''Socialist Review'', arguing that it "evinces a kind of grandiose ignorance" and that "the only principle one can detect here is that the SWP is always in the wrong".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socialistreview.org.uk/article.php?articlenumber=10514|title=What's Going On?|last=Callinicos|first=Alex|date=September 2008|work=Socialist Review|accessdate=16 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Literary critic [[Nicholas Lezard]] praised the book in ''The Guardian'', particularly for its discussion of the break-up of Steel's relationship, which "gives it a poignancy and depth which at its outset one might not have expected".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/apr/11/mark-steel-review|title=Few things are funnier than ageing and disillusionment|first=Nicholas|last=Lezard|work=The Guardian|date=11 April 2009|accessdate=16 November 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2013, Steel was among those who gave their support to the [[People's Assembly Against Austerity|People's Assembly]] in a letter published by ''The Guardian'' newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/feb/05/people-assembly-against-austerity|title=People's Assembly opening letter|date=5 February 2013|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steel spoke at a press conference to launch the [[People's Assembly Against Austerity]] on 26 March 2013&lt;ref&gt;Mark Steel, [https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/peoples-assembly-right-thats-enough-now-what-are-we-going-to-do-about-it-8499928.html Right that's enough now what are we going to do about it?], ''The Independent'', 18 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt; and regional public meetings&lt;ref&gt;Marc Rath, “[http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/Popular-writer-joins-comedian-anti-cuts-rally/story-19131252-detail/story.html Popular writer joins comedian at anti-cuts rally]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}“ ‘’This is Bristol’’ website, 30 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt; in the lead up to a national meeting at [[Westminster Central Hall]] on 22 June 2013. Steel also gave a speech at the People's Assembly Conference in Westminster.

Prior to the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|2015 UK general election]], he was one of several public figures who endorsed the parliamentary candidacy of the [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green Party]]'s [[Caroline Lucas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/apr/24/celebrities-sign-statement-support-caroline-lucas-not-green-party | title= Celebrities sign statement of support for Caroline Lucas – but not the Greens | work=The Guardian | location=London | first=Jessica | last=Elgot | date=24 April 2015 | accessdate=22 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
