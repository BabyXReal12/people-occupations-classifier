'''Richard Ira "Rich" Vos''' (born June 30, 1957) is an American stand-up comedian, actor, and radio and podcast host with his wife, comedian [[Bonnie McFarlane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Rich Vos is still standing|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/theater_arts/articles/2008/09/05/rich_vos_is_still_standing|newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|date=September 5, 2008|accessdate=February 15, 2010|first=Nick A.|last=Zaino III}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Vos grew up in [[Plainfield, New Jersey]] "in an all black neighborhood",&lt;ref name=reality2004/&gt; and was raised Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Marco Island Sun Times|url = http://www.marcoislandflorida.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20121025/MARCOENTERTAINMENT/310250044/1188/Rich-Vos-vows-keep-real-Marco-visit?odyssey=mod%257Cnewswell%257Ctext%257CHome%257Cp|newspaper= Marco Island Sun Times|access-date = January 26, 2016}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents divorced when he was young, and he did not graduate from high school.&lt;ref name=globe2008/&gt; A fan of stand-up comedy since he was a child, Vos was influenced by watching it on television, particularly acts featured on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]''.&lt;ref name=zoiksonline&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zoiksonline.com/2009/10/rich-vos-has-failed-at-everything-but.html|title=Rich Vos has failed at everything but stand-up comedy|publisher=ZoiksOnline|date=October 2009|first=Jason|last=Tanamor|accessdate=March 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
[[File:Rich_Vos_Traveling_Virus_Worcester_2006.jpg|thumb|right|Vos on stage during [[Opie and Anthony's Traveling Virus Comedy Tour (2006)|Opie and Anthony's Traveling Virus Comedy Tour]] in 2006]]
Vos began his stand-up career in 1984, choosing to pursue it full-time as he "failed at everything else",&lt;ref name=reality2004/&gt; and developed his act in local clubs.&lt;ref name=globe2008/&gt; 

In 1995, Vos became the first Caucasian comic to perform a set on ''[[Def Comedy Jam]]'' on [[HBO]], a show usually featuring African American comedians.&lt;ref name=globe2008&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-17113451.htmll|title=Rich Vos is still standing|newspaper=The Boston Globe|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=September 5, 2008|first=Nick A.|last=Zaino III|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|subscription=yes|accessdate=March 17, 2017}}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=reality2004/&gt;

In July 1999, Vos hosted the [[Woodstock '99]] festival, later calling it a highlight of his career.&lt;ref name=shecky2003&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sheckymagazine.com/vos.htm|title=The Next to the Next to the Last Comic Standing - The SHECKYmagazine.com Interview! Rich Vos|publisher=SheckyMagazine.com|accessdate=March 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Vos played the bouncer and wrote and performed skits on the British television show ''[[The People vs. Jerry Sadowitz]]''. In 2001, Vos released a stand-up comedy album, ''I'm Killing Here''. This was followed by the DVD ''Vos'', consisting of an unedited, 55-minute performance recorded at the [[Stress Factory]] in [[New Brunswick, New Jersey]], released in 2004. He went on to produce two half-hour specials on ''[[Comedy Central Presents]]''.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

In 2003, Vos came third on the first season of ''[[Last Comic Standing]]'' on [[NBC]]. During this time he was given the nickname "The Don" by [[Cory Kahaney]] "because of my rough and tough demeanor ... maybe it was more because I was the most experienced comic".&lt;ref name=reality2004&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realityshack.com/archives/491|title=Interview with Rich Vos of Last Comic Standing – Reality Shack|date=September 11, 2004|website=Realityshack|accessdate=March 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the season, Vos toured with Kahaney and [[Dave Mordal]] for eight months.&lt;ref name=reality2004/&gt; In 2004, Vos was a finalist in its third season.

Vos was a frequent guest on the ''[[Opie and Anthony]]'' radio show,&lt;ref name=philweekly2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=globe2008/&gt; with jokes centered at his expense, most often highlighting his speech impediment or supposed lack of intellect. In 2002, he brought comedian [[Patrice O'Neal]] onto the show who also became a popular regular guest. During the show's time on [[Sirius XM Satellite Radio]], Vos hosted a Saturday night program with Bonnie McFarlane. He hosted the 2006 and 2007 editions of the [[Opie and Anthony's Traveling Virus Comedy Tour (disambiguation)|Opie and Anthony's Travelling Virus Comedy Tour]].&lt;ref name=globe2008/&gt;

From 2002 to 2004, Vos was a frequent guest on ''[[Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn]]'' on [[Comedy Central]]. He picked the show as one of his favourites to do as he lived close to its filming location and by the fact that he could do it with his best friends.&lt;ref name=reality2004/&gt;

Between 2006 and 2008, Vos prepared three pilot episodes for a comedy series alongside McFarlane, but neither were picked up by a network.&lt;ref name=globe2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=dayton2008&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-19302518.html|title=Rich Vos to make Dayton debut at Wiley's Oct. 9-12|newspaper=[[Dayton Daily News]]|publisher=[[Cox Enterprises]]|date=October 10, 2008|first=Don|last=Thrasher|via=HighBeam Research|subscription=yes|accessdate=March 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vos has appeared on ''[[Premium Blend]]''. He was featured in a segment of the television show, ''[[What Would You Do? (ABC News series)|What Would You Do?]]'' In November 2011, Vos began a podcast with McFarlane titled ''My Wife Hates Me''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.riotcast.com/mywifehatesme Vos and Bonnie's 'My Wife Hates Me'], RiotCast.com; accessed November 29, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=buffalo2016/&gt;

In December 2016, Vos released his fifth comedy album ''V'', of which its material took between one year and a half and two years to develop. It charted at number one on the [[iTunes]] and ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' release charts.&lt;ref name=buffalo2016&gt;{{cite web|url=http://buffalonews.com/2016/12/27/comedian-rich-vos-amped-new-years-eve|title=Comedian Rich Vos amped for New Year's Eve|date=December 27, 2016|newspaper=[[The Buffalo News]]|publisher=[[Berkshire Hathaway|BH Media]]|first=Mark|last=Ciemcioch|accessdate=March 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
After struggling with crack cocaine and alcohol addiction throughout his 20s, Vos completed a one-month rehabilitation course in 1987, three years into his comedy career. He has been sober since.&lt;ref name=globe2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=philweekly2014&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-3296770821.html|title=Rich Vos|newspaper=The Philadelphia Weekly|date=April 2, 2014|first=Daniel|last=Gelb|via=HighBeam Research|subscription=yes|accessdate=March 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vos was previously in a marriage that ended in a divorce. He has two daughters with his previous wife, and remained in their lives which he wrote: "I have been there to see my kids grow up and that truly is the highlight of my life and I'm dodging 'em ".&lt;ref name=shecky2003/&gt; He moved into a home two miles away from them so he could see them more.&lt;ref name=reality2004/&gt; In September 2005, Vos married comedian [[Bonnie McFarlane]], who competed on the second season of ''Last Comic Standing''. In 2007 they had a daughter.&lt;ref name=globe2008/&gt;

Vos moved to [[Hillsborough Township, New Jersey]] to be closer to his children.&lt;ref&gt;Condran, Ed. [http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=BURB&amp;p_multi=LBCB&amp;p_theme=burb&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=1100F37750EC90B8&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM "Rich Vos"], ''Bucks County Courier Times'', February 23, 2006; accessed July 10, 2013.&lt;br&gt;"'I'm very close with my daughters,' Vos said. 'I moved to Hillsborough to be close to them. I know comics who never see their kids. I don't get that.'"&lt;/ref&gt;
