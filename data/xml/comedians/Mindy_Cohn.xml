==Early life and career==
Cohn was born in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], in 1966, and was raised Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mindy-cohn/why-me-why-now-why-not_b_3223346.html?ir=Yahoo | work=Huffington Post | first=Mindy | last=Cohn | title=How I Completely Accidentally Serendipitously Became A Teenage Sitcom Star | date=2013-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was discovered by actress [[Charlotte Rae]] when Rae and the producers of ''The Facts of Life'' visited [[Harvard-Westlake School|Westlake School]] in [[Bel Air, Los Angeles|Bel Air, California]], while doing research for the show.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

 | title = Milwaukee Talks Charlotte Rae

 | accessdate = 2007-06-23
 | author = Molly Snyder Edler
 | publisher = www.onmilwaukee.com }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Cohn was cast as Natalie Green and portrayed the character for the series' entire run (1979–88), as well as in the reunion movie (2001).&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news 
|title= Facts of Life remain the Same
|publisher= Toronto Star  
|page= D02
|date= 2001-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her work on ''The Facts of Life'' was honored when she was ranked 43rd on VH1's List of 100 Greatest Kid Stars.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news 
|title= VH1 Names Gary Coleman the Greatest Kid Star
|publisher= prnewswire.com 
|date= 2005-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, she commented on Charlotte Rae's lobbying on her behalf: "Mr. Reynolds calls me into his office. It seemed that Charlotte Rae had fallen madly in love with me, in part because I reminded her of her best childhood friend Natalie — and I was irrepressible, charming, and hilarious. So she asked the producers to create a part for me in the show. Honestly, the whole thing seemed so fantastic I didn’t know what to think."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mindy-cohn/why-me-why-now-why-not_b_3223346.html|title=Why Me? Why Now? Why Not|publisher=Huffington Post.com|date=May 7, 2013|accessdate=November 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the show, she still remained friends with Rae. Just 2 months before her acting mentor's 90th Birthday in 2016, when Cohn was unavailable to attend ''The Facts of Life'' reunion interview, she even bestowed Rae a video message praising her decades-long friend for teaching Cohn the craft of acting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hallmarkchannel.com/home-and-family/monday-february-15th-2016|title=Home &amp; Family's "Facts of Life" Reunion|publisher=Hallmark Channel.com|date=February 15, 2016|accessdate=November 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
{{expand section|date=September 2015}}
Cohn has a degree in [[cultural anthropology]] from [[Loyola Marymount University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later career==
Cohn has continued her acting career outside of ''The Facts of Life''. In 1984 she had a leading role as the daughter alongside Stockard Channing in RKO's video production of "Table Settings". In 1986, she appeared in ''[[The Boy Who Could Fly]]'' playing the part of Geneva. She also had guest appearances in other popular TV shows, including ''[[Charles in Charge]]'' (playing Buddy's sister Bunny, a young [[alcoholic]], in the 1988 episode "Bottle Baby"), and two guest appearances in the second season of the cop drama ''[[21 Jump Street]]'' (playing Rosa in the 1987 episode "Christmas In Saigon" and the 1988 episode "Chapel of Love"). In 2004 Cohn appeared in the WB comedy ''[[The Help (TV series)|The Help]]''.  In 2010, Cohn played the role of Violet, the leading character in [[Casper Andreas]]'s movie ''[[Violet Tendencies]],'' and appeared on the Season 8 premiere of [[TLC (TV channel)|TLC]]'s ''[[What Not to Wear (US TV series)|What Not to Wear]]'' on October 29, 2010. She appeared in an episode of ''[[Hot in Cleveland]]'' on July 13, 2011, on ''[[The Secret Life of the American Teenager]]'' on March 26, 2012, and in ''[[The Middle (TV series)|The Middle]]'' on May 21, 2014.

Cohn said that one of the reasons she did ''[[The Facts of Life Reunion#The Facts of Life Reunion|The Facts of Life Reunion]]'' in 2001 was that the actors in the long-running series have been wrongly denied a cut of the [[Syndication (television)|syndication]] and [[DVD]] profits from the series. "We all never got paid and still don't get paid for DVDs and reruns ... we felt we were owed."&lt;ref&gt;
