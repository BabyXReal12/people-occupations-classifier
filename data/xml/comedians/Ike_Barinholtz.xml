He had planned on becoming a politician,&lt;ref name="ChicagoTribune-2004" /&gt; but decided to move to [[Los Angeles, California]], to be an actor instead. He worked at a telemarketing company and as a [[busboy]] before starting a career in comedy.&lt;ref name="RedEye-2013"&gt;{{cite news|last=Wagner|first=Curt|url=http://articles.redeyechicago.com/2013-01-07/entertainment/36197592_1_lou-malnati-deep-dish-ike-barinholtz/2|title=Ike Barinholtz finds time for laughs in 'The Mindy Project'|date=2013-01-07|publisher=redeyechicago.com|accessdate=2013-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barinholtz also attended [[Boston University]] and after dropping out, he worked for the [[Chicago Transit Authority]] before starting his comedy career.&lt;ref name="ChicagoTribune-2012" /&gt; In a 2013 interview, he said he dropped out of school because he hated it and was doing poorly.&lt;ref name="RedEye-2013" /&gt;

In a 2012 phone interview, Barinholtz said he was inspired to pursue a career in comedy after attending a comedy show at [[The Vic Theatre]] and seeing several other comedians.&lt;ref name="ChicagoTribune-2012" /&gt; Afterwards, he started taking comedy classes at [[The Second City]], [[ImprovOlympic]] and [[Annoyance Theatre]], and was not successful at first, but chose to stick with it.&lt;ref name="RedEye-2013" /&gt; His younger brother Jon Barinholtz is also an actor and comedian.

==Career==
Barinholtz spent two years in [[Amsterdam]] with the famed comedy troupe [[Boom Chicago]], along with [[Jordan Peele]], [[Josh Meyers (actor)|Josh Meyers]] and [[Nicole Parker]]. Barinholtz hosted the 'Worst of Boom Night' during a 10-year anniversary of the improv troupe Boom Chicago, where they performed their worst material from previous shows.

He has appeared in the films ''The Adventures of Big Handsome Guy and His Little Friend'' (2005), ''Love, Fear and Rabbits'' (2005) and ''Down'' (2001). Barinholtz currently lives in Los Angeles. Barinholtz is a founding member of The Lindbergh Babies, an improv group directed by [[Del Close]], who worked with [[John Belushi]], [[Bill Murray]], [[Mike Myers (actor)|Mike Myers]] and [[Chris Farley]].

In 2012, Barinholtz joined the cast of the third season of the [[HBO]] series ''[[Eastbound &amp; Down]]'', playing the role of Ivan Dochenko, Kenny Powers' Russian rival.

He starred alongside [[Seth Rogen]] in the 2014 comedy ''[[Neighbors (2014 film)|Neighbors]]'', as well as its 2016 [[Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising|sequel]]. Also in 2016, Barinholtz played prison guard Griggs in the [[DC Comics]] film ''[[Suicide Squad (film)|Suicide Squad]]''.

Barinholtz appeared in a regular role as nurse Morgan Tookers on the [[Hulu]] comedy series ''[[The Mindy Project]]''. He was also a writer and story editor on the series. He also has a role in ''[[Friends from College]]'', a [[Netflix]] original.

===''MADtv''===
Barinholtz officially joined the cast of ''[[MADtv]]'' in 2002 as a feature performer for the eighth season. He was later promoted to a repertory performer status the following season. Barinholtz would often pair up with fellow cast member [[Josh Meyers (actor)|Josh Meyers]] in various sketches for the eighth and ninth seasons similar to the [[Mike Myers (actor)|Mike Myers]]/[[Dana Carvey]] and [[Jimmy Fallon]]/[[Horatio Sanz]] duos on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.

His contract, like most other ''MADtv'' cast members, was for five seasons which was up for renewal at the conclusion of the show's 12th season. Barinholtz has commented that he started getting "restless" and did not see eye to eye with some of the ''MADtv'' bosses about how decisions were being made.&lt;ref name="RedEye-2013" /&gt;

In 2009, he performed at the [[List of improvisational theater festivals|Chicago Improv Festival]] alongside former ''MADtv'' cast member [[Jordan Peele]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jones|first=Chris|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2009-02-18/entertainment/0902170225_1_headliners-chicago-improv-festival-cuts|title=Chicago Improv Festival announces headliners, cuts prices|date=2009-02-18|publisher=chicagotribune.com|accessdate=2013-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Barinholtz performed at another Chicago Improv Festival event with his brother, Jon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wagner|first=Curt|url=http://articles.redeyechicago.com/2012-03-25/entertainment/31237516_1_chicago-improv-festival-jordan-peele-keegan-michael-key|title=Chicago Improv Festival to honor Key and Peele|date=2012-03-25|publisher=redeyechicago.com|accessdate=2013-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
