'''Kathleen Madigan''' (born September 30, 1965) is an [[United States|American]] [[Stand up comedy|comedian]] and [[celebrity|TV personality]]. In addition to her stand up comedy performances, she is a regular guest on a variety of U.S. television programs.

==Early life and education==
Kathleen Madigan is one of seven children in the large [[Irish American|Irish]] [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] family of Jack and Vicki Madigan, a lawyer and a nurse respectively.&lt;ref name=STL&gt;{{cite web|last=Durchholz|first=David|url=http://www.stlmag.com/St-Louis-Magazine/October-2012/A-Conversation-with-Kathleen-Madigan/|title=A conversation with Kathleen Madigan|publisher=''St. Louis Magazine'' via official website|date=October 2012|accessdate=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|people=Kahleen Madigan|title=Kathleen Madigan - Mormon Temple|medium=comedy video|publisher=YouTube|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jDfdJSO5po}}&lt;/ref&gt; She grew up mostly in the [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] suburb of Florissant,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://onstageatiup.com/artists/madigan.php|title=Kathleen Madigan artist bio|year=2012 |accessdate=2011-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the family also lived for periods of time in [[House Springs, Missouri]] and in the [[Lake of the Ozarks]] region of central Missouri.&lt;ref name=STL/&gt; Madigan received the first eight years of her education largely in private Catholic schools, although she also attended the public school of the Osage.&lt;ref name=STL/&gt; It was there she excelled as a student athlete, participating in volleyball, track, and basketball.&lt;ref name=STL/&gt; In the latter, she set a record by winning the 1978 Mid-Missouri Hoops Shoot Championship. At the time 4'5" tall, she was the shortest person to ever win the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7blzImYvGqA|title= KSDK St. Louis - Heidi Goes To Hollywood -|year=2006|accessdate=2016-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gothamcomedyclub.com/comedian.cfm?id=714|title=Kathleen Madigan bio|year=2009|accessdate=2011-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; She shot under-handed, sinking 14 of 15 attempts.

Madigan attended [[McCluer North High School]], graduating in 1983.&lt;ref name=Legends&gt;''Missouri Legends: Famous People From The Show-Me State'' by John W. Brown. Page 166. Published by Reedy Press, St. Louis, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; She admitted in a 2012 interview with ''[[St. Louis Magazine]]'', however, that she participated in few activities like float decorating or prom, choosing instead to work at a [[steakhouse]] where she could make up to $200 per night.&lt;ref name=STL/&gt; Madigan attended [[University of Missouriâ€“St. Louis]] for two years, but, according to Madigan, all she did was accumulate $7,000 in campus parking tickets.&lt;ref name=STL/&gt;  At [[Southern Illinois University Edwardsville]], she earned a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in Journalism in 1988.&lt;ref name=Legends/&gt; While at SIUE she was in charge of the student newspaper and also served an internship with the [[St. Louis Blues]] professional ice hockey team.&lt;ref name=Funny/&gt;

==Professional career==

Madigan first took a job in print journalism, working for the St. Louis-area [[Suburban Journals]] newspapers as well as the publications department of the [[Missouri Athletic Club]]. At the same time she performed stand-up during "open mic" nights at St. Louis area comedy clubs. She credits her father, Jack, with encouraging her to try a comedy career.&lt;ref name=Father&gt;{{cite web|last=Richmond|first=Dick|url=http://www.delafont.com/comedians/Comedian_Articles/madigan-kmpostd.html|title=Father is fodder for St. Louis comedian|publisher=''The St. Louis Post-Dispatch''|date=20 May 1993|accessdate=17 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her growing popularity at these soon led to the offer of a paying job in stand-up from The Funny Bone, a nationwide chain of comedy clubs.&lt;ref name=STL/&gt; With a thirty-week booking of guaranteed dates, Madigan gave up her jobs in Missouri. She cites [[Ron White]], [[Richard Jeni]] and [[Lewis Black]] among her influences in those early comedy club days.&lt;ref name=STL/&gt;

Among the TV shows and specials Madigan has appeared on are ''[[Last Comic Standing]]'', ''[[I Love the 90s: Part Deux]]'', ''[[I Love the '80s 3-D]]'', and ''[[Celebrity Poker Showdown]]''. She also starred in her own [[HBO]] Half-Hour Comedy Special and a ''[[Comedy Central Presents]]'' special. She is a veteran of ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'', ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'', ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'', and ''[[The Bob and Tom Show]]''.&lt;ref name=Kathleen/&gt; She also hosts a radio program, ''[[Blue Collar Comedy (radio)|Blue Collar Comedy]]'', on [[Sirius XM Radio]].
Madigan has twice participated in [[United Service Organizations|USO]] shows in support of American troops, touring both Iraq and Afghanistan along with fellow comedians like friend [[Lewis Black]].&lt;ref name=About&gt;{{cite web|last=Bromley|first=Patrick|url=http://comedians.about.com/od/comediansmz/p/Kathleen-Madigan-Biography.htm|title=Madigan biography|publisher=About.com|year=2013|accessdate=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She sometimes writes material for other comedians, as was the case in 2004 and 2005 when she was a writer for [[Garry Shandling]] when he hosted the [[Emmy Award]]s telecast.&lt;ref name=About/&gt; In 2016, she made an appearance on Jerry Seinfeld's web series ''Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Stroked Out on a Hot Machine"|url=http://comediansincarsgettingcoffee.com/kathleen-madigan-chuck-martin-stroked-out-on-a-hot-machine|accessdate=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honors==
In 1996, Madigan won "Funniest Female Stand-Up Comic" at the American Comedy Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Awards|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0534904/awards|publisher=[[IMDb]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Madigan is single and lives in Los Angeles most of the time. She also owns a farm in the Midwest and, according to her, "spends inordinate amounts of time" with her family there.&lt;ref name=Kathleen&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kathleenmadigan.com/bio-credits/|title=Kathleen's Bio/Credits|year=2011|accessdate=2011-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Madigan has four brothers and two sisters.&lt;ref name=Father/&gt; She has often drawn on her father as both a source of comic material and work ethic.&lt;ref name=Funny&gt;{{cite web|last=Chuang|first=Brandon|url=http://www.stlmag.com/St-Louis-Magazine/May-2005/Theres-Nothing-Funny-About-Kathleen-Madigan/|title=There's nothing funny about Kathleen Madigan|publisher=''St. Louis Magazine''|date=May 2005|accessdate=17 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
