'''Leo Bernard Gorcey''' (June 3, 1917&lt;ref&gt;Social Security Death Index&lt;/ref&gt;– June 2, 1969) was an [[United States|American]] stage and movie actor who became famous for portraying the leader of the group of young hooligans known variously as the [[Dead End Kids]], [[East Side Kids|The East Side Kids]], and as an adult, [[The Bowery Boys]]. Always the most pugnacious member of the gangs in which he participated, young Leo was the filmic prototype of the young punk. He was the shortest member of the original gang.

==Early years==
Gorcey was born in [[New York City]], on June 3, 1917. The son of 16-year-old Josephine (née Condon), an  [[Irish Catholic]] immigrant, and 31-year-old Bernard Gorcey, a [[Russian Jews|Russian Jewish]] immigrant, both [[vaudeville|vaudevillian]] actors as well as small people. Bernard Gorcey was {{cvt|4|ft|10|in}}, and his wife was {{cvt|4|ft|11|in}}; as an adult, Leo would reach {{cvt|5|ft|6|in}}.

==Film career==
In the 1930s, Leo's father became estranged from the family while working in theater and film. When he returned in 1935, he and Leo's brother, David, persuaded Leo to try out for a small part in the play ''Dead End''. Having just lost his job as a plumber's apprentice and seeing his father's relative success, Leo decided to give acting a try. Leo and David were cast as two members of the East 53rd Place Gang (originally dubbed the "2nd Avenue Boys" in the play ''Dead End'' published by playwright Sydney Kingsley) with limited stage time. Charles Duncan, who was originally cast as Spit, left the play, and Leo, his understudy, was promoted. Gorcey created a quarrelsome guttersnipe whose greatest joy was in making trouble.
[[File:Leo Gorcey in Gallant Sons trailer.jpg|thumb|Gorcey in the film ''Gallant Sons'' (1940)]]
In [[1937 in film|1937]], [[Samuel Goldwyn]] made the popular play into a [[Dead End (1937 film)|movie of the same name]] and transported the six rowdy boys to [[Hollywood]]. Gorcey became one of the busiest actors in Hollywood for the next 20 years.
*From 1937 to [[1939 in film|1939]], he starred in 7 ''[[Dead End Kids]]'' movies where he played characters with various names
*From [[1940 in film|1940]] to [[1945 in film|1945]], he starred in 21 ''[[East Side Kids]]'' movies where he played the character named Ethelbert "Muggs" McInnis/McGinnis/Maloney
*From [[1946 in film|1946]] to [[1956 in film|1956]], he starred in 41 ''[[The Bowery Boys|Bowery Boys]]'' movies where he played the character named Terence Aloysius "Slip" Mahoney

In the [[The Bowery Boys|Bowery Boys]] movies, Leo's father, [[Bernard Gorcey]], played Louie Dumbrowski, the diminutive sweetshop owner from whom the boys conned banana splits and financial loans.  Leo's character "Slip" was famed for his [[malapropism]]s always delivered in a [[Brooklyn accent]], such as "a clever seduction" for "a clever deduction", "I depreciate it!" ("I appreciate it!"), "I regurgitate" ("I reiterate"), and "optical delusion" ("optical illusion")."

In 1939, Gorcey married 17-year-old dancer Kay Marvis, who appeared in four of his Monogram movies. They divorced in 1944, after which Kay met [[Groucho Marx]] and very soon after, became Groucho's wife. In 1949, Gorcey married Amelita Ward, with whom he had worked in ''[[Clancy Street Boys]]'' and ''[[Smugglers' Cove]]''. She gave birth to Leo Gorcey, Jr., during their marriage.

Also in 1944, Gorcey had a recurring role in the [[Pabst Blue Ribbon]] Town radio show, starring [[Groucho Marx]].  In 1948, Gorcey played a small role in the sophisticated movie comedy ''[[So This Is New York]]'' starring acerbic radio and television comedian [[Henry Morgan (comedian)|Henry Morgan]] and featuring [[Arnold Stang]].

In 1955, after his father was killed in an automobile accident, Gorcey began abusing alcohol and lost a great deal of weight. When he trashed a movie set in an intoxicated rage, the studio refused to give him the pay raise he demanded, so he quit the Bowery Boys and was replaced in the last seven movies by [[Stanley Clements]]. Leo's brother David remained with the series until it ended in early 1958.

During the 1960s, Leo did very little acting. He did appear in the epic 1963 comedy, ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'', in a bit part.  Gorcey then made two final appearances on film with Huntz Hall in a pair of low budget productions: ''Second Fiddle To A Steel Guitar'' (1966) and ''[[The Phynx]]'' (1970).

==Life after acting==
In 1967, Gorcey published his autobiography, entitled ''An Original Dead End Kid Presents: Dead End Yells, Wedding Bells, Cockle Shells, and Dizzy Spells''.  In 2003, Gorcey's son Leo, Jr., published a book about his father, entitled ''Me and the Dead End Kid''  In 2017, a third book on his life, ''Leo Gorcey's Fractured World'' was published by Jim Manago and examines his use of malaprops in his Bowery Boys films.

Gorcey's first cousin, twice removed, is sports writer Ryan Gorcey.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}
Another of Gorcey's first cousins, twice removed, is actress Liz Gorcey, who is most known for her role in the 1984 film, ''[[Footloose (1984 film)|Footloose]]''.

His image was to appear on the cover of  The Beatles album ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' but he requested a fee and was painted out. Coincidentally, he died on the second anniversary of the album's US release.

==Death==
Years of alcoholism eventually caught up with Gorcey. He died of [[liver failure]] on June 2, 1969, one day short of his 52nd birthday.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1817&amp;dat=19690604&amp;id=k180AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=B5wEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7364,1122659 Leo Gorcey dies; A dead end kid]&lt;/ref&gt; He is buried at Molinos Cemetery in [[Los Molinos, California]].
