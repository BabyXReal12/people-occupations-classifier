==Career==
[[File:Jonah Hill by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Hill at 2010 [[San Diego Comic Con International]]]]

===Early work===

In college, Hill began writing his own plays and performing them in the ''Black and White'' bar in the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] neighborhood of New York City.&lt;ref name="htc"&gt;"[http://www.hobotrashcan.com/2006/08/03/one-on-one-with-jonah-hill/ One on One with... Jonah Hill]", ''Hobo Trashcan'', August 2006. Retrieved on June 29, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; His plays developed a small following and helped him realize that his true desire was to act in films. Hill was befriended by [[Dustin Hoffman|Dustin Hoffman's]] children, Rebecca and [[Jake Hoffman|Jake]], who introduced Hill to their father.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The elder Hoffman asked him to audition for a role in ''[[I Heart Huckabees]]'', in which Hill made his film debut.&lt;ref name="htc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTimes Young"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Young|first1=Molly|title=Jonah Hill Is No Joke|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/07/magazine/jonah-hill-is-no-joke.html|website=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=January 16, 2018|date=August 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hill then made a brief appearance in [[Judd Apatow|Judd Apatow's]] directorial debut ''[[The 40-Year-Old Virgin]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Guerrasio|first1=Jason|title=Jonah Hill's 9 Funniest Moments|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2808892/jonah-hill-funniest-scenes/|publisher=[[MTV]]|accessdate=January 16, 2018|date=December 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which eventually led to his appearing in the role of a virgin video game tester in the comedy ''[[Grandma's Boy (2006 film)|Grandma's Boy]]''  (2006) and featuring in the comedies ''[[Accepted]]'' and ''[[Click (2006 film)|Click]]'', playing [[Adam Sandler]]'s character's son in the latter film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Caroll|first1=Larry|title=Justin Long, Jonah Hill Hope To Be 'Accepted' Into Adam Sandler Film|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1537540/justin-long-jonah-hill-hope-to-be-accepted-into-adam-sandler-film/|publisher=[[MTV]]|accessdate=January 16, 2018|date=July 31, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hill was featured in a larger supporting role in the Apatow-directed ''[[Knocked Up]]'' (2007). On television, Hill played the "RA Guy" on the first season of the [[Oxygen Network]] sitcom ''[[Campus Ladies]]''.

===2007–2012===
His first leading role was in the Apatow-produced comedy ''[[Superbad (film)|Superbad]]''. Hill starred in the film alongside [[Michael Cera]], in roles based on the film's writers, [[Seth Rogen]] and [[Evan Goldberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Aquino|first1=Tara|title=11 Super Great Facts About ‘Superbad’|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/66546/11-super-great-facts-about-superbad|website=[[Mental Floss]]|accessdate=March 30, 2016|date=July 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film is often cited as the film that launched the careers of the two actors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rabin|first1=Nathan|title=Christopher Mintz-Plasse of Superbad|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/jonah-hill-michael-cera-and-christopher-mintz-plas-14140|website=[[The A.V.

He turned down a role as one of the three principal comedic actors in ''[[The Hangover]]'' so he could work with directors [[Jay Duplass]] and [[Mark Duplass]] in ''[[Cyrus (2010 comedy-drama film)|Cyrus]]'' (2010).&lt;ref name=stern&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.howardstern.com/show/2014/1/21/jonah-hill-academy-award-nominated-superfan/ |title=Jonah Hill: Academy Award-nominated Superfan |date=January 21, 2014 |accessdate=July 24, 2016 |quote= |publisher=[[Howard Stern Show]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Angie Han |title=Jonah Hill Turned Down ‘The Hangover’ to Focus on Dramatic Acting |url=http://www.slashfilm.com/trivia-jonah-hill-turned-down-the-hangover-to-focus-on-dramatic-acting/ |quote= |newspaper=[[Slashfilm]] |date=June 27, 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Nicole Sperling | title = Jonah Hill no longer in talks for 'Transformers 2' | work = Entertainment Weekly | date = May 6, 2008 | url = http://hollywoodinsider.ew.com/2008/05/jonah-hill.html | accessdate = May 7, 2008 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080509022701/http://hollywoodinsider.ew.com/2008/05/jonah-hill.html | archivedate = May 9, 2008 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He guest-starred in an [[List of Reno 911! episodes#Season 6: 2009|episode]] of ''[[Reno 911!]]'', which aired on April 1, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chavez|first1=Danette|title=Cary Fukunaga to direct Emma Stone and Jonah Hill in dark comedy series|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/cary-fukunaga-direct-emma-stone-and-jonah-hill-dar-233987|website=[[The A.V.

He next starred in Judd Apatow's third directorial feature, ''[[Funny People]]'' (2009), which also starred [[Adam Sandler]], [[Eric Bana]] and Seth Rogen.
