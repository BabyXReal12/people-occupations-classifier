'''Samuel Burl Kinison''' (December 8, 1953 &amp;ndash; April 10, 1992) was an American [[stand-up comedian]] and actor. He was known for his intense, harsh and politically incorrect humor. A former [[Pentecostal]] [[preacher]], he performed stand-up routines that were most often characterized by an intense style, similar to charismatic preachers, and punctuated by his trademark scream.

==Early life==
Samuel Burl Kinison was born in [[Yakima, Washington]] on December 8, 1953, the son of Marie Florence (''née'' Morrow) and Samuel Earl Kinison, a [[Pentecostal]] preacher.&lt;ref name="biography"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biography.com/people/sam-kinison-424006 |title=Sam Kinison, Comedian (1953–1992) |publisher=[[A+E Networks]] |accessdate=February 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family moved to [[East Peoria, Illinois]] when Kinison was three months old.&lt;ref name="pjs-called"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.pjstar.com/news/x1356915489/Luciano-Comedian-called-this-home |title=Comedian called this 'home' |first=Phil |last=Luciano |work=[[Peoria Journal Star]] |date=April 10, 2012 |page=B1 |accessdate=April 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father pastored several churches around the country, receiving little income. Kinison had two older brothers, Richard and Bill, and a younger brother, Kevin. His parents divorced when he was 11 and his brother Bill went to live with his father while Sam stayed with the rest of his family against his protestations. Bill described this as the root of much of Sam's anger.&lt;ref name="gq"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/entertainment/articles/2012-04/20/sam-kinison-tribute-death-wild-thing-quotes-video/viewall |journal=[[GQ]] |date=April 20, 2012 |title=Icon: Sam Kinison |last=Jones |first=Dylan |accessdate=January 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sam later attended [[East Peoria Community High School]] in East Peoria.&lt;ref name="biography"/&gt; He and his brothers emulated their father by becoming Pentecostal preachers. Kinison attended [[Pinecrest Bible Training Center]] in [[Salisbury, Herkimer County, New York|Salisbury Center, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.megiloth.com/thoughts_and_opinions/social_commentary/samkinison.htm |title=Leader of the Banned |publisher=Megiloth.com |date=December 8, 1953 |accessdate=May 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother married another preacher and moved to [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], where Kinison lived for a while. He preached from the age of 17 to 24 and recordings of his sermons reveal that he used a "[[fire and brimstone]]" style, punctuated with shouts similar to the ones he would later use in his stand-up routines. His brother Bill, however, noted that "ironically, he had no stage presence" and he was not very successful at making money from preaching.&lt;ref name="gq" /&gt; After he and his first wife were divorced, he abandoned preaching and took up comedy as a profession.

==Career==
Kinison began his career in [[Houston, Texas]], where he performed in small clubs. He became a member of a comedic group at the [[Comedy Workshop]], known as the [[Texas Outlaw Comics]], that also included [[Bill Hicks]], [[Ron Shock]], Riley Barber, Steve Epstein, Andy Huggins, John Farneti,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://recoverycomedy.com/promo-andy-huggins.html |title=Recovery Comedy is proud to present Andy Huggins |publisher=Recovery Comedy |date= |accessdate=May 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Jimmy Pineapple.&lt;ref name="gq" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://recoverycomedy.com/promo-jimmy-pineapple.html |title=Recovery Comedy is proud to present Jimmy Pineapple |publisher=Recovery Comedy |date= |accessdate=May 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hicks cited Kinison as a major influence on his comedic style, noting that "He was the first guy I ever saw to go on stage and not in any way ask the audience to like him."&lt;ref name="gq" /&gt; In 1980, Kinison moved to [[Los Angeles]] hoping to find work at [[The Comedy Store]], but was first employed as a doorman. He soon developed a [[cocaine]] habit, quickly progressing to the freebase form, and struggled to make a foothold in the business until his brother Bill moved to Los Angeles to help manage his career.&lt;ref name="gq" /&gt;

His big break came on [[HBO]]'s ''Rodney Dangerfield's Ninth Annual Young Comedians Special'' in the summer of 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6069058/ |title=Kinison: The Scream Continues (2016) |publisher=[[IMDb]] |accessdate=November 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After noting the performance of [[Bob Nelson (comedian)|Bob Nelson]], reviewer [[Stephen Holden]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, "the most interesting of the other eight comedians is the savagely misogynistic Sam Kinison. Mr. Kinison specializes in a grotesque animalist howl that might be described as the primal scream of the married man."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/02/arts/nine-comedians-appear-on-dangerfield-special.html |title=Nine Comedians Appear On Dangerfield Special |work=[[The New York Times]] |author-link=Stephen Holden |last=Holden |first=Stephen |date=August 2, 1985 |accessdate=February 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, during Kinison's appearance on ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'' in 1985, [[David Letterman|Letterman]]'s introduction of Kinison warned his audience, "Brace yourselves. I'm not kidding. Please welcome Sam Kinison."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_VURr6jnWQ |title=Sam Kinison First Appearance on Letterman |publisher=YouTube |accessdate= May 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kinison played on his former role as a Bible-preaching evangelist, taking satirical and sacrilegious shots at the [[Bible]], [[Christianity]] and famous Christian evangelist scandals of his day. Kinison's daring comedy helped shoot him to stardom.&lt;ref name="biography" /&gt; On several videos of his stand-up routines, a shot of his personalized license plate reveals the words "EX REV."

Kinison made his film debut in Rodney Dangerfield's 1986 film ''[[Back to School]]'', playing short-tempered Contemporary American History professor Dr. Terguson, who also happened to be a [[Vietnam veteran]].

He was associated with the Los Angeles rock music scene and was occasionally accompanied by a touring band. He also gained a reputation as having a prodigious appetite for [[recreational drug use|drugs]] and [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]].&lt;ref&gt;''Sam Kinison'', ''Biography Channel'', December 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, Kinison recorded a novelty version of [[The Troggs]]' "[[Wild Thing (The Troggs song)|Wild Thing]]", which appeared on his album ''Have You Seen Me Lately?'' The video was a hit on [[MTV]]. It featured a cameo by [[Rodney Dangerfield]] and [[Jon Bon Jovi]], and starred many well-known rock musicians of the time, including [[Steven Tyler]] and [[Joe Perry (musician)|Joe Perry]] of [[Aerosmith]], [[Jonathan Cain]] and [[Deen Castronovo]] of [[Bad English]], [[Richie Sambora]] and [[Alec John Such]] of [[Bon Jovi]], [[Slash (musician)|Slash]] and [[Steven Adler]] of [[Guns N' Roses]], [[Tommy Lee]] of [[Mötley Crüe]], [[C.C. DeVille]] of [[Poison (American band)|Poison]], [[Rudy Sarzo]] of [[Quiet Riot]], [[Billy Idol]], and [[Ratt]], as well as a raunchy "roll on the mat" dance with [[Jessica Hahn]]. Also in 1988, Kinison appeared in the music video for the [[Bon Jovi]] single "[[Bad Medicine (song)|Bad Medicine]]".

Kinison appeared in the episode "[[It's a Bundyful Life]]: Part 2" (1989) of ''[[Married... with Children]]'', as [[Al Bundy]]'s [[guardian angel]], who shows him what life would be like If he hadn't been born (a [[parody|sendup]] of ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]''). He was also considered for the lead role of Al Bundy during preproduction of the show.
[[File:Sam Kinison.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Kinison in the 1980s]]
Also during 1989, he lent his voice to the song "The Kid Goes Wild" by the band [[Babylon A.D. (band)|Babylon A.D.]]; the song was heard (briefly) in the movie ''[[RoboCop 2]]'', but not the portion featuring Kinison's voice. Kinison also appeared in the Mötley Crüe music video for their hit single "[[Kickstart My Heart]]".

During one notable ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson|Tonight Show]]'' performance, Kinison delivered what began as a straightforward version of [[Elvis Presley]]'s "[[Are You Lonesome Tonight? (song)|Are You Lonesome Tonight?]]", which descended into angry ranting during the spoken breakdown, and then segueing back into a straightforward sung ending.

Some of Kinison's most notable spontaneous moments came during his frequent appearances on ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]''. He made an angry phone call on-air to [[Bobcat Goldthwait]], and he embarrassed comedian [[Judy Tenuta]] to the point of driving her off the show. His most notorious stunt resulted in an on-air feud with Stern. Kinison made an on-air promise to bring to the show members of the band Bon Jovi, with whom Stern was feuding, but they did not appear, nor did Kinison. Stern's reaction was swift and vindictive, and Kinison eventually apologized, but not before comedian [[Gilbert Gottfried]] and Stern ridiculed an emotionally charged phone call between Stern and Kinison, in which both stars used the words "man" and "dude" so often that the playback was used as a bit on the show.

Stern and Kinison eventually reconciled and paired on Stern's pay-per-view special, ''U.S. Open Sores''. Stern would later purchase the movie rights to Kinison's biography, written by Kinison's brother, at one point (2008) reporting that [[HBO]] would make ''Brother Sam'' with Kinison being played by [[Dan Fogler]].&lt;ref name=BioPic&gt;{{cite news |url=https://variety.com/2008/scene/markets-festivals/brother-sam-set-for-hbo-1117996022/ |title='Brother Sam' set for HBO |first=Michael |last=Fleming |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=November 17, 2008 |accessdate= January 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, Kinison starred in the [[Fox Network]] television show ''[[Charlie Hoover]]'', in which he played the inner voice of the title character, appearing as a {{convert|12|in|cm|adj=on}} tall man. The show lasted only seven episodes before being canceled.

In an interview with Sam's brother and manager Bill Kinison, Bill mentioned movie deals that were in development at the time of his death; one such deal was a movie with [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], and another with [[Rick Moranis]].&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Bill. [http://www.bullz-eye.com/entertainment/interviews/2009/bill_kinison.htm "A Chat with Bill Kinison"]. Bullz-Eye.com. January 13, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kinison's legendary scream can be heard at the beginning of [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]]'s 1987 song, "[[I'm the Man (EP)|I'm the Man]]" and one of his comedy punch-lines ("Dick in your mouth all day!"), can be heard multiple times in [[Run–D.M.C.]]'s 1988 single, "Beats to the Rhyme."

==Personal life==
Kinison acquired much of his material from his difficult first two marriages, to Patricia Adkins (1975–1980) and Terry Marze (1981–1989). He began a relationship with dancer Malika Souiri toward the end of his marriage with Marze. In 1990, Souiri alleged she was raped by a man Kinison had hired as a bodyguard that same day, while Kinison was asleep in the house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20118169,00.html |title=Sam Kinison's Girlfriend Claims That While the Comic Slept Off a Hard Night, She Was Being Raped by His Bodyguard |journal=[[People (magazine)|People]] |date=July 9, 1990 |accessdate=May 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bodyguard stated that the sex was consensual; the jury deadlocked in the subsequent trial and the charges were later dropped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-10-26/local/me-3274_1_jury-deadlocks |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |title=Jury Deadlocks in Kinison Bodyguard's Rape Trial |date=October 26, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1991/Charges-Dropped-Against-Kinison-s-Former-Bodyguard/id-e59fb1bd6ecdd5f940a7c1ca1a8ca18f |title=Charges Dropped Against Kinison's Former Bodyguard |publisher=[[Associated Press]] |date=February 8, 1991 |accessdate=May 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 4, 1992, six days before his death, Kinison married Souiri at the Candlelight Chapel in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]].&lt;ref name="pjs-called"/&gt; They honeymooned in [[Hawaii]] for five days before returning home to [[Los Angeles]] on April 10 to prepare for a show that night at the [[Riverside Resort Hotel &amp; Casino|Riverside Resort Hotel and Casino]] in [[Laughlin, Nevada]].&lt;ref name="lat-shocked" /&gt;

Souiri sued Kinison's brother Bill in 1995 for allegedly defaming her in his book ''Brother Sam: The Short Spectacular Life of Sam Kinison'', and then again in 2009 for allegedly forging Sam's will.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Kinison-Widow-Sues-Brother-in-Law-Over-Book-3038143.php |title=Kinison Widow Sues Brother-in-Law Over Book |newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date=April 7, 1995 |accessdate=May 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tmz.com/2009/06/23/sam-kinisons-widow-cries-fraud/ |title=Sam Kinison's Widow Cries Fraud |date=June 23, 2009 |publisher=[[TMZ]]| accessdate=January 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2011, the ''[[Toronto Sun]]'' reported that Kinison had fathered a child with the wife of his best friend and opening act, Carl LaBove, who had been paying child support for the girl for nearly 13 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=[[Daily Mail]] |title=Sam Kinison's secret love child: DNA test allegedly prove a friend's daughter was fathered by the late comic |date=February 18, 2011 |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1358387/Sam-Kinisons-secret-love-child-DNA-test-friends-daughter-fathered-late-comic.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; LaBove filed legal papers claiming the girl was Kinison's, and [[Genetic testing|DNA tests]] taken from Kinison's brother Bill show a 99.8% likelihood that Kinison was the father of the unnamed woman, who was 21 at the time of the ''Toronto Sun'' story, and excluded LaBove as her father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.torontosun.com/entertainment/celebrities/2011/02/19/17337136-wenn-story.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110224022207/http://www.torontosun.com/entertainment/celebrities/2011/02/19/17337136-wenn-story.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=February 24, 2011 |title=Kinison fathered lovechild, pal says &amp;#124; Celebrities &amp;#124; Entertainment |newspaper=[[Toronto Sun]] |date=February 19, 2011 |accessdate=May 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
On Friday, April 10, 1992, Kinison died at the age of 38 after his white 1989 Pontiac 20th Anniversary Turbo Trans Am&lt;ref&gt;[[Pontiac Firebird (third generation)#1989]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=August 2018}} was struck head-on on [[U.S. Route 95 in California|U.S. Route 95]], {{convert|4|mi|km}} north of [[Interstate 40 in California|Interstate 40]] and around {{Convert|15|mi|km}} northwest of [[Needles, California]], by a [[pickup truck]] driven by 17-year-old Troy Pierson, who had been drinking alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/12/us/sam-kinison-38-comedian-dies-wife-injured-in-head-on-collision.html |date=April 12, 1992 |newspaper=The New York Times |first=Bruce |last=Lambert |title=Sam Kinison, 38, Comedian, Dies; Wife Injured in Head-On Collision |access-date=August 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/61604443.html?dids=61604443:61604443&amp;FMT=ABS |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=April 14, 1992 |title=Teen in Crash Used Alcohol, CHP Says |access-date=August 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pickup truck crossed the center line of the roadway and went into Kinison's lane. At the time of the collision, Kinison was traveling to [[Laughlin, Nevada]] to perform at a sold-out show.&lt;ref name="lat-shocked"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-04-12/news/mn-456_1_bill-kinison |first=Amy |last=Wallace |date=April 12, 1992 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |title=Friends Shocked by Violent Death of Mellower Kinison |access-date=August 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kinison was found lying between the seats of his car at the scene of the collision. He was not killed instantly, according to his brother.&lt;ref name="biography"/&gt;

His brother and the others begged him to lie down and he did with his best friend, Carl LaBove, who had been in the following van, holding his head in his hands. Initially, Kinison appeared to have suffered no serious injuries, but within minutes he suddenly said to no one in particular, "I don’t want to die. I don’t want to die." LaBove later said, "it was as if he was having a conversation, talking to someone else, some unseen person." Then there was a pause as if Kinison was listening to the other person speak. Then he asked "But why?" and after another pause LaBove heard him clearly say: "Okay, okay, okay.’ LaBove said, "The last ‘okay’ was so soft and at peace&amp;nbsp;... Whatever voice was talking to him gave him the right answer and he just relaxed with it. He said it so sweet, like he was talking to someone he loved."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.paulluvera.com/weblog/2009/11/the-strange-death-of-sam-kinison.html| title=THE STRANGE DEATH OF SAM KINISON| website=Paul Luvera Journal| access-date=2017-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kinison then lost consciousness. Efforts to resuscitate him failed. Kinison died at the scene from internal injuries. An autopsy found that he had suffered numerous traumatic injuries, including a dislocated neck, a torn [[aorta]], and torn blood vessels in his abdominal cavity, which caused his death within minutes of the collision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.autopsyfiles.org/reports/Celebs/kinison,%20sam_report.pdf |format=PDF |title=Sam Kinison Autopsy Report |access-date=August 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-05-29/news/mn-346_1_sam-kinison |title=Tranquilizers, Cocaine Found in Kinison's System |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=May 29, 1992 |agency=Associated Press |access-date=August 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malika Souiri, Kinison's wife, whom he had married six days earlier, was rendered unconscious by the collision, but survived the accident with a mild concussion.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, Larry. ''Sam Kinison: Why Did We Laugh?''. 1998. Pacific Sundog Productions, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pierson pled guilty to one count of vehicular manslaughter with gross negligence. He was sentenced to one year of probation and 300 hours of community service, and his driver's license was suspended for two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR108281?refcatid=16 |title=Kinison album, concert vid planned |newspaper=Variety |date=June 29, 1993 |access-date=May 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kinison is interred with family members at the Memorial Park Cemetery in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]]. His grave marker includes the unattributed quote: "In another time and place he would have been called prophet."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waymarking.com/gallery/image.aspx?f=1&amp;guid=6128d334-753b-411b-aa30-23497ab34bfc&amp;gid=3 |title=Sam Kinison |publisher=Waymarking.com |date= |access-date=May 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Comedian [[George Carlin]]'s eighth HBO stand-up comedy special, ''[[Jammin' in New York]]'', was dedicated to Kinison's memory. At the beginning of the broadcast, the words "this show is for SAM" appeared on the screen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sk-oAWH_W6c |title=George Carlin - Jammin' In New York Part1 |access-date=May 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his death, Kinison was fondly remembered by his friends and costars. [[Ozzy Osbourne]] said, "Apparently when Sam had the accident, I heard he got out of the car and look up to the heavens and said, 'I don't want to die,' and then just said, 'Oh, okay,' and laid down and died. It sounds crazy and will probably offend a lot of my fans, but I believe there's a higher power. Some people may think Sam Kinison's in one place, but I know where he is. He's upstairs; he's next to God."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.digitaljournal.com/blog/1395#ixzz3T076UaMb |title=Sam Kinison |work= Digital Journal |first= Gloria | last= Scott |date= November 11, 2008 |access-date= February 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
