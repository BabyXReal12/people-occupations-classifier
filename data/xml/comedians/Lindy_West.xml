==Career==
In 2009, West began working as the film editor for Seattle's alternative weekly newspaper, ''[[The Stranger (newspaper)|The Stranger]]''.&lt;ref name=Profile/&gt; In 2011, she moved to Los Angeles, but continued to write for ''The Stranger'' until September 2012.&lt;ref name=Profile/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://seattlest.com/2011/08/30/lindy_west_announces_move_to_la_sea.php "Lindy West Announces Move to LA, Seattle Cries."] ''Seattlest.''

One of the most distinctive voices advancing feminist politics through humor, West is behind a handful of popular pieces — "How to Make a Rape Joke" on Jezebel, "Hello, I Am Fat" on The Stranger’s blog, "Ask Not for Whom the Bell Trolls; It Trolls for Thee" on "[[This American Life]]" — that have helped shift mainstream attitudes about [[body image]], comedy and online harassment over the past several years. Culture molds who we are, West argues, but it’s ours to remold in turn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/19/books/review/sex-object-a-memoir-and-shrill-notes-from-a-loud-woman.html|title=‘Sex Object: A Memoir’ and ‘Shrill: Notes From a Loud Woman’|last=Tortorici|first=Dayna|date=2016-06-13|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-01-17|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In 2013 West won the [[Women's Media Center]] Social Media Award, which was presented by [[Jane Fonda]] in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name="WomensMediaCenter"&gt;{{Citation|title=Lindy West Wins Women's Media Center Social Media Award|date=October 8, 2013|url=http://www.womensmediacenter.com/about/press/press-releases/lindy-west-wins-womens-media-center-social-media-award|publisher=[[Women's Media Center]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accepting the award, West said, "I hear a lot these days about the lazy, aimless '[[millennials]]' – about how all we want to do is sit around twerking our iPods and Tweedling our Kardashians – and I also hear people asking, 'Where is the next generation of the social justice movement? Where are all the young feminists and womanists and activists?'

On September 19, 2015, West co-founded [[Shout Your Abortion]], a social media campaign on [[Twitter]] where people share their abortion experiences online without "sadness, shame or regret" for the purpose of "destigmatization, normalization, and putting an end to shame".
