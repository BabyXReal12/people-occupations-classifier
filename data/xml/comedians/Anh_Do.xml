==Biography==

===Refugee===
Do and his family fled to Australia as refugees in 1980.&lt;ref name="The Age"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/money/investing/profile-anh-do-20110201-1abk3.html | location=Melbourne | work=The Age | title=Profile: Anh Do | date=2 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 2010 autobiography, ''The Happiest Refugee'', Do tells of how his family survived five days in a leaky fishing boat nine and a half metres long and two metres wide. During the trip his family and the rest of the passengers were attacked by two different bands of pirates. The first group stole one out of the two engines and the second group of pirates stole the second engine, which had been broken but repaired by Do's father using a piece of rubber from a thong. It was reported that as the second band of pirates left, one of them threw a gallon of water onboard which kept all but one of the refugees alive, until they were finally rescued by a German merchant ship.&lt;ref name="Happiest Refugee"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Do|first=Anh|title=The Happiest Refugee |url=https://www.allenandunwin.com/browse/books/general-books/biography-autobiography/The-Happiest-Refugee-Anh-Do-9781742372389 |publisher=Allen&amp;Unwin|year=2010|isbn=978-1-74237-238-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boat was packed with 40 [[Vietnamese Australians|Vietnamese refugees]] fleeing across the Indian Ocean. "We were crammed in like sardines," he said.&lt;ref name="Dow"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.stevedow.com.au/Default.aspx?id=403 | title=No laughing matter | publisher=Steve Dow | date=May 10, 2009 | accessdate=May 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Happiest Refugee'' has won many awards, including the 2011 Australian Book of the Year, Biography of the Year and Newcomer of the Year, as well as the Indie Book of the Year Award 2011, Non-fiction Indie Book of the Year 2011, and it was shortlisted for the 2011 [[NSW Premier's Literary Awards]], [[Community Relations Commission Award]].&lt;ref name="Happiest Refugee"/&gt;

=== Career ===
[[File:Anh Do walking the red carpet.jpg|thumb|Do with wife Suzanne in 2005, walking the red carpet at the premiere of ''[[Footy Legends]]'']]
Do attended [[St Aloysius' College (Sydney)|St Aloysius' College]] in Milsons Point for his secondary education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McCowen|first=Sharyn|title=Happiest refugee gives 'all credit to big fella upstairs'|url=http://www.catholicweekly.com.au/article.php?classID=3&amp;subclassID=9&amp;articleID=7334&amp;subclass=A%20conversation%20with||publisher=The Catholic Weekly|accessdate=7 February 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222175106/https://www.catholicweekly.com.au/article.php?classID=3&amp;subclassID=9&amp;articleID=7334&amp;subclass=A%20conversation%20with|archivedate=22 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he was 14 he started a small business breeding tropical fish. While studying his first year of law at the [[University of Technology, Sydney]], he owned a stall which sold American-Indian artifacts, which he later expanded to four franchised stores. Six months before finishing his combined Business Law degree, law firms offered him jobs which required 60 hours of work a week. He opted to take up stand-up comedy instead.&lt;ref name="The Age"/&gt; Since 2013 Do has cut back on comedy to focus on painting full-time. He was a finalist in the [[Archibald Prize]] in [[List of Archibald Prize 2014 finalists|2014]] and [[List of Archibald Prize 2017 finalists|2017]] .
