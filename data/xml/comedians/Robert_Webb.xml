At the age of 20, Webb attended [[Robinson College, Cambridge]], where he studied English and became vice-president of the [[Footlights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2005/dec/03/weekend7.weekend1|title=Q&amp;A Robert Webb|accessdate=2008-04-19|date=3 December 2005|author=Rosanna Greenstreet|publisher=The Guardian|location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; Webb and Mitchell met at an audition for a Footlights production of ''[[Cinderella]]'' in 1993.&lt;ref name=timesinter&gt;{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article3303938.ece|title=Mitchell and Webb are back on TV|date=9 February 2008|accessdate=2008-04-19|publisher=The Times|author=Janice Turner|location=London, UK|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615200742/http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article3303938.ece|archive-date=June 2011|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Mitchell and Webb===
The two put together their first project, ''Innocent Millions Dead or Dying - A Wry Look at the Post-Apocalyptic Age (With Songs)'', in January 1995, a show about [[World War I]].&lt;ref name=theobserver&gt;{{cite news|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/magazine/story/0,,1856420,00.html|title=Masters of comedy|author=Mitchell, Ben|date=27 August 2006|accessdate=8 December 2014|publisher=The Observer|location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=findarticles&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4159/is_20061119/ai_n16858943|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070513023506/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4159/is_20061119/ai_n16858943|dead-url=yes|archive-date=13 May 2007|title=David Mitchell &amp; Robert Webb|date=19 November 2006|work=[[The Independent on Sunday]]|accessdate=8 December 2014|author=Harris, Sarah}}&lt;/ref&gt; Webb later described it as being "fucking terrible".&lt;ref name=theobserver/&gt;

From this, the duo were given the chance to write for [[Alexander Armstrong]] and [[Ben Miller]] and for series two of ''[[Big Train]]''.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; After minor work on ''The Jack Docherty Show'' and ''Comedy Nation'', their first break into television acting was in 2000, on the short-lived BBC sketch show ''[[Bruiser (TV series)|Bruiser]]'', which they primarily wrote, and starred in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/guide/articles/b/bruiser_66600740.shtml|title=Bruiser|author=Lewisohn, Mark|accessdate=8 December 2014|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, the duo was commissioned for a sketch show of their own, entitled ''[[The Mitchell and Webb Situation]]'', which ran for six episodes on the now defunct channel [[Play UK]].&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; Mitchell and Webb's next project came in 2003, with starring roles in the [[Channel 4]] sitcom ''[[Peep Show (TV series)|Peep Show]]'', as flatmates [[Mark Corrigan (Peep Show)|Mark Corrigan]] and [[Jeremy (Peep Show)|Jeremy "Jez" Usbourne]] respectively.&lt;ref name=peepshow&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sitcom.co.uk/peep_show|title=Peep Show|publisher=The British Sitcom Guide|accessdate=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pair shared the 2007 [[Royal Television Society]] Award for "Comedy Performance",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rts.org.uk/Information_page_+_3_pic_det.asp?id=34996&amp;sec_id=503 |title=Programme Awards 2007: Winners |publisher=Royal Television Society |accessdate=8 December 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080328012919/http://www.rts.org.uk/Information_page_%2B_3_pic_det.asp?sec_id=503&amp;id=34996 |archivedate=28 March 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and were jointly nominated for Best Television Comedy Actor at the 2006 British Comedy Awards.&lt;ref name=bca&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6147936.stm|title=British Comedy Awards: Nominations|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Webb was nominated for the Best Television Comedy Actor award again, this time without Mitchell, in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/news/a187349/british-comedy-awards-the-nominations.html|title=British Comedy Awards: The Nominations|accessdate=8 December 2014|author=Mayer Nissim|work=[[Digital Spy]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Peep Show'' has aired nine series, making it the longest-running sitcom in Channel 4 history.&lt;ref name=show&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-11100448|title=Frankie Boyle heads new Channel 4 season|accessdate=8 December 2014|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the success of ''Peep Show'' Mitchell and Webb returned to sketch comedy with their [[BBC Radio 4]] [[sketch show]] ''[[That Mitchell and Webb Sound]]'', which ran for four series. The show was adapted for television and became ''[[That Mitchell and Webb Look]]'', producer [[Gareth Edwards (producer)|Gareth Edwards]] described it as "the shortest pitch (he had) ever written".&lt;ref name=theobserver/&gt; Towards the end of 2006 the pair made their first tour, with a show called ''[[The Two Faces of Mitchell and Webb]]''. The tour was criticised as just "a succession of largely unrelated scenes" by ''[[The Guardian]]''{{'}}s Brian Logan, who gave it a rating of two stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/reviews/story/0,,1929726,00.html|title=The Two Faces of Mitchell and Webb|accessdate=8 December 2014|author=Logan, Brian|publisher=The Guardian|location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''That Mitchell and Webb Look'' won them the [[BAFTA]] for "Best Comedy Programme or Series" at the 2007 awards,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6670797.stm|title=Victoria Wood scoops Bafta double|accessdate=8 December 2014|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they earned a further nomination for it in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/mar/24/bafta-tv-awards-nominations|title=Bafta TV Awards 2009: nominations|accessdate=8 December 2014|work=The Guardian|location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was nominated for two British Comedy awards in 2006: "Britain's Best New TV Comedy" and the "Highland Spring People's Choice".&lt;ref name="bca"/&gt; Their stage tour ''The Two Faces of Mitchell and Webb'' was nominated for the British Comedy Award for "Best Stage Comedy",&lt;ref name=bca/&gt; and ''That Mitchell and Webb Sound'' won a Sony Silver Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/thatmitchellandwebbsite/radio.shtml|title=That Mitchell and Webb Sound|accessdate=2007-04-14|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their first film, ''[[Magicians (2007 film)|Magicians]]'' was released on 18 May 2007. It was directed by [[Andrew O'Connor (actor)|Andrew O'Connor]] and written by Jesse Armstrong and Sam Bain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2006/05/25/4217/that_mitchell_and_webb_movie|title=That Mitchell and Webb movie|accessdate=8 December 2014|publisher=chortle.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Webb played the role of modern magician Karl.&lt;ref name=magicians&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/film/advertorial/magicians/|title=Magicians|publisher=Channel 4|accessdate=2007-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They filmed ''Playing Shop,'' a comedy television pilot for [[BBC2]] about two men who operate a business out of their shed, which they also wrote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/a137869/mitchell--webb-reveal-new-sitcom.html|title=Mitchell and Webb reveal new sitcom|work=[[Digital Spy]]|author=Michael Thornton|accessdate=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the BBC were happy with it, Mitchell and Webb scrapped it themselves, as they felt it was too similar to ''Peep Show''. A new pilot had been commissioned,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/5487340/Interview-David-Mitchell-and-Robert-Webb.html|title=Interview: David Mitchell and Robert Webb|work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|author=Andrew Pettie|accessdate=8 December 2014|location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the plan was later shelved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timeout.com/london/comedy/features/9598/David_Mitchell-interview.html|title=David Mitchell: interview|author=Phil Harrison|work=[[Time Out (company)|Time Out]]|accessdate=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The duo fronted the campaign of the UK version of [[Apple Inc.]]'s [[Get a Mac]] adverts, with Mitchell playing a PC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macobserver.com/article/2007/01/29.2.shtml|title=Apple UK Get a Mac Ads Debut|author=Gamet, Jeff|accessdate=8 December 2014|publisher=Mac Observer.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The adverts proved controversial. Writing in ''[[The Guardian]]'', [[Charlie Brooker]] claimed that the use of Mitchell and Webb in the adverts was a curious choice. He compared the characters of PC and Mac in the adverts to those of Mark and Jeremy in ''Peep Show'', stating that "when you see the ads, you think, 'PCs are a bit rubbish yet ultimately lovable, whereas Macs are just smug, preening tossers.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/story/0,,2006031,00.html|title=I hate Macs|date=5 February 2007|author=Brooker, Charlie|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=8 December 2014|location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British Sitcom Guide criticised the pair for "selling their souls".&lt;ref name="BSA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sitcom.co.uk/features/awards2006.php|title=The British Sitcom Guide Awards 200|accessdate=8 December 2014|publisher=The British Sitcom Guide}}&lt;/ref&gt; One journalist called the adverts "worse than not funny", and accused Mitchell and Webb of "an act of grave betrayal" for taking corporate work.&lt;ref name=who&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2007/04/07/btmitch107.xml&amp;page=2|title=Who are those guys?|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=8 December 2014|location=London, UK|first=Andrew|last=Pettie}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with ''The Telegraph'', Webb responded to the critics of the Apple adverts, stating that "when someone asks, 'Do you want to do some funny ads for not many days in the year and be paid more than you would be for an entire series of ''Peep Show''?' the answer, obviously, is, 'Yeah, that's fine'".&lt;ref name="who"/&gt; In the same interview, Mitchell also said "I don't see what is morally inconsistent with a comedian doing an advert. It's alright to sell computers, isn't it? Unless you think that capitalism is evil&amp;nbsp;– which I don't. It's not like we're helping to flog a baby-killing machine".&lt;ref name="who"/&gt;

===Solo work===
Webb has appeared in two series of the BBC Three sitcom ''[[The Smoking Room]]'' (2004) and the Radio 4 sketch show ''[[Concrete Cow]]''. In 2005 he appeared in the [[Ben Elton]]-scripted [[BBC One]] sitcom ''[[Blessed (television)|Blessed]]'' as [[Ardal O'Hanlon]]'s 'perfect' counterpart.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/thatmitchellandwebbsite/cast/webb.shtml|title=Robert Webb|publisher=BBC|accessdate=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He and [[Olivia Colman]] also featured as a [[Naturism|naturist]] couple in ''[[Confetti (2006 film)|Confetti]]'', a 2006 film about a competition for the most original wedding. Webb has since said that he believed that his genitals would be pixellated out but only discovered at the screening of the film that they were not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Graham Norton Show Episode 2|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00n9mdw|work=BBC One|publisher=BBC|accessdate=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Alexis"/&gt; Also in 2008, Webb made his West End stage debut in the UK premiere of [[Neil LaBute]]'s ''[[Fat Pig]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/review.php/20820/fat-pig|title=The Stage Review of Fat Pig|accessdate=8 December 2014|publisher=The Stage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Webb won the 2009 series ''[[Let's Dance for Comic Relief|Let's Dance]]'' for the charity [[Comic Relief]], parodying the audition sequence from the film ''[[Flashdance]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7944395.stm|title=Webb dances to Comic Relief title|accessdate=8 December 2014|work=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He narrated the series ''[[Young, Dumb and Living Off Mum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2010/aug/09/voice-over-narration|title=In fine voice: the TV narrators that steal the show|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=8 December 2014|location=London, UK|first=Kathy|last=Sweeney}}&lt;/ref&gt; He hosted a 2010 Channel 4 series looking at the week's online news, ''[[Robert's Web]]''.&lt;ref name=show/&gt;

He has appeared on several panel shows, including ''[[Have I Got News For You]]'', ''[[Never Mind The Buzzcocks]]'' and ''[[QI]]''. In January 2011, Webb appeared on a celebrity version of BBC quiz ''[[Mastermind (TV series)|Mastermind]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Webb|first1=Robert|title='Celebrity Mastermind’ seemed like a good idea – but now I wish I’d passed|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/8113812/Celebrity-Mastermind-seemed-like-a-good-idea-but-now-I-wish-Id-passed.html|accessdate=28 April 2017|work=The Telegraph|date=5 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; answering nine questions correctly on his specialist subject (the novels of [[Ian McEwan]]) and 11 correctly on the general knowledge round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sleb Mastermind - Show 6|url=http://lifeaftermastermind.blogspot.co.uk/2011/01/sleb-mastermind-show-6.html|date=4 January 2011|publisher=lifeaftermastermind.blogspot.co.uk|accessdate=28 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 Webb played Dan, a geology lecturer, in the Channel 4 series ''[[Fresh Meat (TV series)|Fresh Meat]]''. Later that year, he was cast in the [[Costume drama|costume comedy]] ''[[The Bleak Old Shop of Stuff]]'', a parody of [[Charles Dickens]]' works. Since 2011, Webb has replaced [[Rufus Hound]] as team captain on the BBC comedy panel show ''[[Argumental]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jeffery|first1=Morgan|title='Argumental' to relaunch with Sean Lock, Robert Webb|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/news/a337004/argumental-to-relaunch-with-sean-lock-robert-webb/|date=25 August 2011|publisher=digitalspy.com|accessdate=28 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Webb was the narrator of [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]]'s anti-nostalgia series ''10 Things I Hate About'', which began on 16 April 2012. In each episode, Webb presented his opinion on the awful aspects of a particular year (1995, 1990, 1987, and 1999).&lt;ref name="Alexis"&gt;{{cite news|title=Robert Webb: a peep into the future|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/may/31/robert-webb-after-peep-show|accessdate=8 December 2014|author=Alexis Petridis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 Webb presented "Groundbreaking Gags" on [[BBC Three]], in which he looked at the significant [[wikt:Gag|gag]]s that the animated show ''[[Family Guy]]'' has been recognised for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Family Guy – Episodes tagged with Robert Webb (actor)|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006mh4j/episodes/topics/robert_webb_(actor)|archive-url=https://archive.is/20131111062924/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006mh4j/episodes/topics/robert_webb_(actor)|dead-url=yes|archive-date=11 November 2013|work=BBC Three|publisher=BBC|accessdate=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with Mitchell, Webb published his first comedy book ''[[This Mitchell and Webb Book]]'', which was released in the UK and the US in 2009 by HarperCollins imprint [[Fourth Estate (imprint)#Imprints|Fourth Estate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=This Mitchell and Webb Book|url=http://www.noisetosignal.org/2009/09/this-mitchell-and-webb-book.html|work=Noise to Signal|publisher=Noise to Signal|author=Tanya Jones|accessdate=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=This Mitchell and Webb Book |url=http://www.harpercollins.co.uk/Titles/42132 |work=HarperCollins |publisher=HarperCollins Publishers |accessdate=8 December 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111073445/http://www.harpercollins.co.uk/Titles/42132 |archivedate=11 November 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; An abridged edition of highlights from ''This Mitchell and Webb Book'', entitled ''How to Cope with Mitchell and Webb'', was released only in the UK on 1 October 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to Cope with Mitchell and Webb|url=http://www.harpercollins.co.uk/Titles/48194/how-to-cope-with-mitchell-and-webb-abridged-edition-david-mitchell-robert-webb-9780007317158|work=HarperCollins|publisher=HarperCollins Publishers|accessdate=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pair signed a two-book deal with Fourth Estate but, as of November 2013, a second book remains unpublished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/showbiz/a87257/mitchell-and-webb-to-write-comedy-books.html|title=Mitchell and Webb to write comedy books|author=Katie Button|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to being fired, Webb wrote articles for the comments pages of the ''[[The Daily Telegraph|Telegraph]]'' newspaper between 2009 and 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Robert Webb|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/journalists/robert-webb|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=8 December 2014|author=Robert Webb}}&lt;/ref&gt; He criticised those who commented on the online versions of his articles in a ''[[New Statesman]]'' piece.&lt;ref&gt;[http://journalisted.com/robert-webb?allarticles=yes Robert Webb on Journalisted]; accessed 8 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Statesman"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/comedy/2011/08/column-telegraph-writing-knew|title=Who needs S&amp;M when you can write for the Telegraph?|work=[[New Statesman]]|accessdate=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2013 interview, Webb explained his experience with the publication:&lt;blockquote&gt;I wasn't particularly busy at the time, so what I should have been doing in three hours, I was taking a day and a half to do, while getting drunk. I'd sit in the garden, drinking and talking to myself, then go back upstairs, write another sentence, go, 'Oh, this isn't right.' I'd make such a meal of it. If I'd been more professional, I'd have just done it and got on with my life.&lt;ref name="Alexis"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Webb thinks it is harmful for men to 'keep a stiff upper lip' and bottle up their feelings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/health/2017/04/robert-webb-prince-harry-was-right-speak-about-his-mental-health-no-one Robert Webb: Prince Harry was right to speak about his mental health. No one should "man up"] ''[[New Statesman]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Webb began writing his first solo memoir, ''How Not to be a Boy'', on growing up in working man's Lincolnshire. The memoir was released in August 2017. A spoken-word adaptation, read by Webb, was featured as [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]]'s ''[[Book of the Week]]'' to coincide with the launch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b092cnpl|work=''Radio 4'' Book of the Week|title=How Not to Be a Boy|accessdate=1 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Webb married fellow comedy performer Abigail Burdess in 2006, after meeting her on the set of a radio sketch show. Mitchell was the best man at the wedding ceremony.&lt;ref name=timesinter/&gt; They live in [[Kilburn, London]], and have two daughters.&lt;ref name="Alexis"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/journalists/robert-webb/7931323/Will-it-really-matter-if-my-daughter-doesnt-love-scampi.html|title=Will it really matter if my daughter doesn't love scampi?|author=Webb, Robert|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Webb stated that he was a supporter of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]],&lt;ref name="Statesman"/&gt; and rejoined the political party in 2013, in protest at [[Russell Brand]]'s interview on ''[[Newsnight]]'', in which he suggested people should not vote as a form of protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Robert Webb re-joins Labour in protest at Russell Brand|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2013/10/robert-webb-re-joins-labour-protest-russell-brand|work=New Statesman|publisher=New Statesman|author=George Eaton|author-link=George Eaton (journalist)|accessdate=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2008 ''[[The Independent|Independent]]'' piece, Webb explained that he was a "swaggering atheist" prior to the death of his mother, but that the loss led to him starting to pray. Upon reflection, however, Webb stated that his temporary departure from atheism was a coping mechanism for the loss, and after he learned to "co-exist" with his mother's death, he returned to atheism: "... I've returned to total non-belief. I don't know how long it'll last, but God, it's good to be back!"&lt;ref name="Credo" /&gt;

Following the "sell-out" criticism both Webb and Mitchell received for appearing in an advertisement for [[Apple Inc.]]&lt;ref name="Credo" /&gt; Webb stated in 2008:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I'm not a sell-out ... The problem is that that presupposes a set of principles we don't actually hold. We never said comedians shouldn't do ads, or that we somehow operate outside the mixed market economy ... really we're just doing a job.&lt;ref name="Credo" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In August 2014, Webb was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to ''[[The Guardian]]'' expressing their hope that Scotland would vote to remain part of the United Kingdom in September's [[Scottish independence referendum, 2014|referendum on that issue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/aug/07/celebrities-open-letter-scotland-independence-full-text |title=Celebrities' open letter to Scotland – full text and list of signatories |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=7 August 2014 |accessdate=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2015, he announced on [[Twitter]] that he was leaving the Labour Party, citing his lack of confidence in the party's leader, [[Jeremy Corbyn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Khomami|first=Nadia|title=Corbyn critic Robert Webb announces he has left Labour|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/nov/20/robert-webb-announces-he-has-left-labour-and-cites-election-of-corbyn-peep-show|work=Guardian|date=20 November 2015|accessdate=10 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a series of Twitter posts, he also expressed his disdain at the appointment of ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' journalist [[Seumas Milne]] as Labour's press secretary. He was quoted as saying that paying his party subscription with Milne in post made him "feel sick".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnston|first=Ian|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/peep-shows-robert-webb-quits-labour-party-after-rant-against-jeremy-corbyn-a6741211.html|title=Peep Show's Robert Webb quits Labour Party following rant against Jeremy Corbyn|work=The Independent|date=20 November 2015|accessdate=22 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in May 2017, Webb nevertheless endorsed the Labour Party in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2017|2017 UK general election]].&lt;ref name="mirror"&gt;{{cite news |last=Milne|first=Oliver|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/who-celebrities-voting-general-election-10546843|title=Who are celebrities voting for in 2017 General Election?
