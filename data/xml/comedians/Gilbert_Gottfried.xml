'''Gilbert Jeremy Gottfried'''&lt;ref name="Gilbert Gottfried. New York Times"&gt;{{cite web| title= Gilbert Gottfried | work= The New York Times|url= https://www.nytimes.com/movies/person/27947/Gilbert-Gottfried/biography | date= | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140502032528/https://www.nytimes.com/movies/person/27947/Gilbert-Gottfried/biography | archivedate= May 2, 2014 | publisher= republishing material by [[All Movie Guide]]| accessdate= June 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (born February 28, 1955) is an American stand-up comedian, actor and voice actor. Gottfried's persona as a comedian features an exaggerated shrill voice and emphasis on crude humor. His numerous roles in film and television include voicing the parrot [[Iago (Disney character)|Iago]] in Disney's ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'', Digit in the children's cartoon/educational math-based show ''[[Cyberchase]]'', and Kraang Subprime in ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2012 TV series)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]''. Gottfried was also the voice of the [[Aflac Duck]] until 2011.

Since 2014, Gottfried has hosted a [[podcast]], ''Gilbert Gottfried's Amazing Colossal Podcast'', which features new episodes each week featuring discussions of classic movies and celebrity interviews, most often with veteran actors, comedians, musicians and comedy writers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gilbertpodcast.com gilbertpodcast.com]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Gilbert (documentary)|Gilbert]]'', a documentary film on Gottfried's life and career, was released in 2017.

==Career==

===Early career (1970–1998)===
At age 15, Gottfried began doing amateur stand-up in [[New York City]] and, after a few years, became known around New York as "the comedian's comedian."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gilbertgottfried.com/about.php |title=About Gilbert |publisher=Gilbertgottfried.com |date= |accessdate=March 1, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025175708/http://www.gilbertgottfried.com/about.php |archivedate=October 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980, ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' was being retooled with a new staff and new comedians; the producers noticed Gottfried and hired him as a cast member for [[Saturday Night Live (season 6)|season 6]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Edgers |first=Geoff |date=October 30, 2014 |title=The first time Prince could have saved Saturday Night Live |work=[[The Washington Post]] |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2014/10/30/the-first-time-prince-could-have-saved-saturday-night-live/ |accessdate=August 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gottfried's [[persona]] in ''SNL'' sketches was very different from his later characterization: he rarely (if ever) spoke in his trademark screeching, obnoxious voice and never squinted. During his 12-episode stint, he was given very little airtime and seldom used in sketches. Gottfried recalls a low point was having to play a corpse in a sketch about a sports organist hired to play inappropriate music at a funeral. Despite this, he had one recurring character (Leo Waxman, husband to [[Denny Dillon]]'s Pinky Waxman on the recurring talk show sketch, "What's It All About?") and two celebrity impersonations: [[David A. Stockman]] and controversial film director [[Roman Polanski]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Wright |first=Megh |date=October 3, 2012 |title=Saturday Night’s Children: Gilbert Gottfried (1980–1981) |publisher=''Splitsider'' |url=http://splitsider.com/2012/10/saturday-nights-children-gilbert-gottfried-1980-1981/ |accessdate=August 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:GilbertGottfried.jpg|thumb|right|Gottfried at the 1991 Emmy Awards]]

Gottfried also played accountant Sidney Bernstein in the 1987 film ''[[Beverly Hills Cop II]]''.

Although not a regular, he also appeared in ''[[The Amazing Live Sea Monkeys]]'', as well as voicing the crazed dentist Dr. Bender and his son Wendell in ''[[The Fairly OddParents]]'' and the voice of Jerry the Belly Button Elf on ''[[Ren and Stimpy]]''. Three of his most prominent roles came in 1990, 1991, and 1992, when he was cast as the adoption agent [[Problem Child (film)#Cast|Igor Peabody]] in ''[[Problem Child (film)|Problem Child]]'' and ''[[Problem Child 2]]'' and the parrot [[Iago (Aladdin)#Iago|Iago]] in ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]''. When asked how he prepared for the role, Gottfried said, "I did the whole [[Robert De Niro|DeNiro]] thing. I moved to [[South America]]! I lived in the trees!" Gottfried reprised the role in ''[[Aladdin: The Return of Jafar]]'', ''[[Aladdin and the King of Thieves]]'', the [[Aladdin (TV series)|television series]] and various related media, such as ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' and ''[[Disney's House of Mouse|House of Mouse]]''. Gottfried also voiced Berkely Beetle in 1994's Thumbelina.

In 1996, he starred as a talking smoke detector, in "Be Cool about Fire Safety," a short fire safety video for younger audiences.

Gottfried was the host of the Saturday edition of ''[[USA Up All Night]]'' for its entire run from 1989 to 1998.

===Voice acting, television and films (1999–present)===
On the most recent version of ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'', Gottfried was a regular guest. On one particular episode, which aired on October 1, 1999, he was the last square on the board for a five-square win, but both contestants repeatedly got his answers wrong, prompting Gottfried to yell "YOU FOOL!" with every incorrect response. It took seven tries before a contestant finally correctly agreed with him, specifically on a question of "smog" being a combination of smoke and fog.

Gottfried has provided the voice of the duck in the [[Aflac]] commercials and [[Digit (Cyberchase)|Digit]] in ''[[Cyberchase]]'', as well as [[Mister Mxyzptlk]] in ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]''. He also voiced a nasty wisecracking criminal genius named Nick-Nack in two episodes of ''[[Superboy (TV series)|Superboy]]'' (he also co-wrote an issue of ''[[Superboy: The Comic Book]]'', which featured Nick-Nack's origin). On ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'', Gottfried has made regular appearances.

In 2004, [[Comedy Central]] featured Gottfried's stand-up material for ''[[Shorties Watchin' Shorties]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cc.com/episodes/g1iyyi/shorties-watchin--shorties-cook--ross--corbett--vega-season-1-ep-101|title=Cook, Ross, Corbett, Vega|work=Comedy Central |accessdate=September 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gottfried was part of an online advertising campaign for [[Microsoft]]'s [[Office XP]] [[software]], showing, in a series of [[Flash-animated]] [[cartoon]]s, that the [[Clippy]] office assistant would be removed. In 2006, Gottfried topped the ''[[Boston Phoenix]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s tongue-in-cheek list of the world's 100 Unsexiest Men. In April 2006, Gottfried performed with the [[University of Pennsylvania]]'s [[Mask and Wig]] Club in their annual Intercollegiate Comedy Festival. Also in 2006, he made an appearance on the ''[[Let's Make a Deal]]'' portion of ''[[Gameshow Marathon (US TV series)|Gameshow Marathon]]'' (as a baby in a large [[high chair]], he says "Hey [[Ricki Lake|Ricki]], I think I need my diaper changed!"), and in the [[Dodge Viper]] in the big deal (where he tells the contestants "What were you thinking?!" because neither one picked it). He also guest-starred in ''[[The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy]]'' as [[Santa Claus]] in the one-hour Christmas Special. He voiced Rick Platypus in an episode of ''[[My Gym Partner's a Monkey]]'' entitled [[List of My Gym Partner's a Monkey episodes|"That Darn Platypus"]].

[[File:Writer's Guild of America East Soladarity Rally in Washington Square cropped.jpg|thumb|left|Gottfried at the Writers Guild of America East Solidarity Rally in [[Washington Square Park|Washington Square]] on November 27, 2007]]
He appeared as Peter's horse in an episode of ''[[Family Guy]]'' entitled "[[Boys Do Cry]]" (in which [[Peter Griffin]] is enthused to learn that Gottfried is providing the horse's voice). He also guest-starred in ''[[Hannah Montana]]'' as Barny Bittmen. In January 2009, Gottfried worked again with [[David Faustino]] for an episode of Faustino's show ''[[Star-ving]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bill Jensen &amp; Ryan Stewart |url=http://thephoenix.com/boston/recroom/7852-100-unsexiest-men-in-the-world/ |title=The 100 unsexiest men in the world – Ultimate Lists |publisher=ThePhoenix.com |date=March 27, 2008 |accessdate=March 15, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101220153643/http://thephoenix.com/Boston/recroom/7852-100-unsexiest-men-in-the-world/ |archivedate=December 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Gottfried appeared in the episode "Lost Traveler" on ''[[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit]]'' as Leo Gerber, a sarcastic computer professional working for the [[NYPD]]'s Technical Assistance Response Unit, which producer [[Warren Leight]] said could become a recurring character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Gilbert-Gottfried-SVU-1039055.aspx |title=Keck's Exclusives: Gilbert Gottfried to Annoy SVU Cast - Today's News: Our Take |publisher=TVGuide.com |date=October 26, 2011 |accessdate=March 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gottfried read a section from the hit book ''[[Fifty Shades of Grey]]'' in a June 2012 YouTube video, which was created with the aim of using Gottfried's trademark voice to make fun of the book's graphic sexual content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K1RcKJVbHA |title=Gilbert Gottfried reads Fifty Shades of Grey |publisher=Youtube.com |date=June 18, 2012 |accessdate=March 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Gottfried became a member of "Team [[Rachael Ray|Rachael]]" on the second season of [[Food Network]]'s ''[[Rachael vs. Guy: Celebrity Cook-Off]]''. In March 2013 he appeared on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Wife Swap (U.S. TV series)#Celebrity Wife Swap|Celebrity Wife Swap]]''. He swapped wives with [[Alan Thicke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Itzkoff|first=Dave|title=Vulgarity's Abrasive Master, but Not at Home|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/11/arts/television/gilbert-gottfried-on-celebrity-wife-swap.html?_r=1&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;adxnnlx=1365309399-QA4HbBkqahd1YLX0mTg3og|work=The New York Times|accessdate=April 7, 2013|date=March 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also a commentator on ''[[truTV Presents: World's Dumbest...]]''.

On May 28, 2014, Sideshow Network premiered ''Gilbert Gottfried's Amazing Colossal Podcast'', an interview series where Gottfried and his co-host [[Frank Santopadre]] discuss classic movies and talk to "Hollywood legends and behind-the-scenes talents" who shaped Gottfried's childhood and influenced his comedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sideshownetwork.tv/podcastsEpisode.cfm?podcastid=104&amp;episodeID=4821 |title=Sideshow Network |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140701064040/http://sideshownetwork.tv/podcastsEpisode.cfm?podcastid=104&amp;episodeID=4821 |archivedate=July 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first guest was [[Dick Cavett]].

Gottfried was the third contestant fired during [[The Apprentice (U.S. season 14)|the fourteenth season]] of the [[NBC]] [[reality television|reality show]] ''[[The Celebrity Apprentice]]''. In 2016 he played the 'Pig Man' in a comedy/fantasy film ''Abnormal Attraction''.&lt;ref name="imdb.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4470288/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1|title=Abnormal Attraction (2016)|work=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear left}} In 2017 he appeared as himself in ''[[Episodes (TV series)|Episodes]]'', where a contestant on a fictional TV endurance gameshow is penalised with "48 hours of Gilbert Gottfried".

On 10 June 2018 he appeared in a special segment of ''[[Last Week Tonight with John Oliver]]'' where, for UK viewers only, a segment about the UK's law restricting broadcast of debates from the Houses of Parliament was replaced by five minutes of him reading "3 star Yelp reviews", along with host [[John Oliver]] telling the audience "you brought this on yourself because of your stupid law".

==Personal life==
In the late 1990s, Gottfried met Dara Kravitz at a [[Grammy Award]]s party. They were married in 2007 and have two children together, daughter Lily and son Max.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newser.com/story/comments/164190/what-its-like-being-married-to-gilbert-gottfried.html |title=Discussion of: What It's Like Being Married to Gilbert Gottfried - 'NYT' takes a look at Gottfried's marriage ahead of 'Celebrity Wife Swap' |publisher=Newser.com |date= |accessdate=April 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They reside in the [[Chelsea, Manhattan|Chelsea]] neighborhood of [[Manhattan]]. Gottfried was raised in a [[American Jews|Jewish family]], but he has commented on his podcast that he did not have a [[bar mitzvah]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishjournal.com/podcast_news_and_reviews/item/gilbert_gottfried_talks_to_the_jewish_journal_to_play_carolines_on_broadway]&lt;/ref&gt; One of his sisters was [[Arlene Gottfried]], a New York Street photographer, who died in 2017.

==Comedic style==
Danny Gallagher of the ''[[Dallas Observer]]'' wrote that "Gottfried has one of the most original formulas in the history of comedy", adding: 
{{Cquote|You don't just laugh at the punchline when Gilbert Gottfried tells a joke. You laugh at the setup. You laugh at his comments about the joke. You even laugh at the segues between his jokes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.dallasobserver.com/arts/gilbert-gottfried-talks-comedy-jared-kushner-and-his-addison-improv-appearance-9848340 | title =Gilbert Gottfried Talks About the Voice that Made Him a Comedy Icon | work = Dallas Observer | date = August 25, 2017 | accessdate = September 21, 2017 | first=Danny| last=Gallagher}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Gottfried is known for speaking in a loud and grating voice, which is not his natural speaking voice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.miaminewtimes.com/arts/gilbert-gottfried-at-palm-beach-improv-august-25-and-august-26-9617129 | title =Gilbert Gottfried on Showbiz Stupidity and Hollywood Legends | work = Miami New Times | date = August 25, 2017 | accessdate = September 21, 2017 | first=Angel| last=Melendez}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Binneli of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' described Gottfried as a "squinting, squawking mass of contradictions", noting his status as "one of America's filthiest stand-ups and one of the most successful voice-over artists in children's entertainment."&lt;ref name="RS"/&gt; Gottfried is known for joking about recent tragedies. In a July 2012 [[op-ed]] for [[CNN]], he wrote: 
{{Cquote|I have always felt comedy and tragedy are roommates. If you look up comedy and tragedy, you will find a very old [[Sock and buskin|picture of two masks]]. One mask is tragedy. It looks like it's crying. The other mask is comedy. It looks like it's laughing. Nowadays, we would say, 'How tasteless and insensitive. A comedy mask is laughing at a tragedy mask.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.cnn.com/2012/07/16/opinion/gottfried-tosh-joke/index.html | title = If you don't want to hear an edgy joke, don't listen | publisher = CNN | date = July 12, 2012 | accessdate = September 21, 2017 | first=Gilbert| last=Gottfried}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Controversial jokes==

===1991 Emmy Awards===
At the [[43rd Primetime Emmy Awards]], Gottfried made "an endless series of masturbation jokes" in reference to [[Paul Reubens]]' arrest for masturbating in an adult movie theater.&lt;ref name="hr1991"&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/emmy-timeline-89006 | title = Emmy timeline | work = The Hollywood Reporter | date = September 17, 2009 | accessdate = September 21, 2017 | first=Chris | last=Koseluk }}&lt;/ref&gt; Viewers on the east coast saw the entire set live, but Fox censored the broadcast for the west coast delay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = https://www.upi.com/Archives/1991/08/26/Blue-Sunday-at-Emmy-Awards/3085683179200/ | title = Blue Sunday at Emmy Awards | publisher = UPI | date = August 21, 1991 | accessdate = September 21, 2017 | first=Valerie| last=Kuklenski}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fox issued an apology, stating that Gottfried's jokes were "irresponsible and insulting".&lt;ref name="hr1991"/&gt; Gottfried said that producers stated he would not be invited back,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = https://www.timeout.com/newyork/comedy/whats-eating-gilbert-gottfried | title = What's eating Gilbert Gottfried? | work = Time Out | date = December 15, 2005 | accessdate = September 21, 2017 | first=Howard | last=Halle }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' wrote that the monologue resulted in him being "blacklisted".&lt;ref name="RS"&gt;{{cite news| url = https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/features/the-annoying-guy-20050728 | title = Gilbert Gottfried: The Annoying Guy | work = Rolling Stone | date = July 18, 2005 | accessdate = September 21, 2017 | first=Binelli | last=Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===September 11 joke===
During his monologue at a [[New York Friars' Club|Friars Club]] [[Roast (comedy)|roast]] of [[Hugh Hefner]] three weeks after the [[September 11 attacks]], Gottfried joked that he had intended to catch a plane, but could not get a direct flight because "they said they have to stop at the [[Empire State Building]] first". This was one of the first public examples of [[9/11 humor]]. Audience members responded with hisses and a cry of "Too soon!" Gottfried then abandoned his prepared remarks and launched into the venerable [[The Aristocrats (joke)|Aristocrats joke]], winning back the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://observer.com/2005/08/why-have-a-night-like-this-in-times-like-these/ |first=Frank |last=DiGiacomo |title=Why Have a Night Like This in Times Like These? |publisher=The New York Observer |date=August 7, 2005 |accessdate=May 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Penn Jillette]] and [[Paul Provenza]] used Gottfried's monologue as a segment in their 2005 film ''[[The Aristocrats (film)|The Aristocrats]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050811/REVIEWS/50727001 | first = Roger | last = Ebert | authorlink  = Roger Ebert | title = The Aristocrats | publisher = Roger Ebert.com | date =August 12, 2005 | accessdate =March 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japanese tsunami jokes===
In March 2011, Gottfried made a series of jokes on his [[Twitter]] account about the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|earthquake disaster in Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/mjs538/the-10-worst-gilbert-gottfried-tsunami-jokes#.bvXp12Jv1N|title=The 10 Worst Gilbert Gottfried Tsunami Jokes|work=BuzzFeed}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aflac]], which does 75% of its business in Japan, responded by dismissing Gottfried from voicing its [[Aflac#The Aflac Duck|duck mascot]] on March 14, 2011, and announced a casting call for his replacement as the voice of the duck.&lt;ref name="HR"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/gilbert-gottfried-fired-as-aflac-167382 |title=Gilbert Gottfried Fired as Aflac Duck After Japan Tweets |publisher=The Hollywood Reporter |date=March 14, 2011 |accessdate=March 15, 2011 |first=Mark |last=Cina}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was replaced by Daniel McKeague (who did an impression of Gottfried) on April 26, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tv.yahoo.com/blog/the-aflac-ducks-new-voice-comes-from-a-minnesota-sales-manager--2832 |title=The Aflac Duck's New Voice Comes From a Minnesota Sales Manager |publisher=Yahoo |accessdate=April 26, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430093529/http://tv.yahoo.com/blog/the-aflac-ducks-new-voice-comes-from-a-minnesota-sales-manager--2832 |archivedate=April 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
