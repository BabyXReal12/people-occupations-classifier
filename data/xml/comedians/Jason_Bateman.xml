==Career==

===Television===
[[File:Jason bateman 9-20-1987.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Bateman in 1987]]
Bateman first appeared in a cereal commercial for [[Golden Grahams]] in 1980 and began his television career on ''[[Little House on the Prairie (TV series)|Little House on the Prairie]]'' as James Cooper, an orphaned boy who, along with his sister, is adopted by the Ingalls family. From 1982 to 1984, he was a supporting character on the television show ''[[Silver Spoons]]'' as [[Ricky Schroder]]'s "bad boy" best friend Derek Taylor. He appeared in the ''[[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]'' third-season episode "Lost Knight" in 1984, and a number of other small television roles. In 1984, in response to his popularity on ''Silver Spoons'', the show's producers gave Bateman his own starring role as Matthew Burton on the [[NBC]] sitcom ''[[It's Your Move]]'', from September 1984 to February 1985. In 1987, he appeared with [[Burt Reynolds]] on the men's team in the inaugural week of game show ''[[Win, Lose or Draw]]''.

Bateman earned the status of [[teen idol]] in the mid-1980s for his television work, most notably as David Hogan on ''[[The Hogan Family]]'' (originally titled ''Valerie'' and later, ''Valerie's Family'', after [[Valerie Harper]] left the series). He became the [[Directors Guild of America]]'s youngest-ever director when, aged 18, he helmed three episodes of ''The Hogan Family''. After the series ended its run, he gained international recognition in the motion picture sequel ''[[Teen Wolf Too]]'', which was a box office failure. In 1994, he played opposite [[Katharine Hepburn]] and [[Anthony Quinn]] in the television film ''[[This Can't Be Love (film)|This Can't Be Love]]''. During this period, he had roles on four series — ''[[Simon (U.S. TV series)|Simon]]'', ''[[Chicago Sons]]'', ''[[George &amp; Leo]]'', and ''[[Some of My Best Friends]]''—none of which lasted longer than one season. He also directed an episode of ''[[Two of a Kind (U.S. TV series)|Two of a Kind]]'' in 1999. In 2002, he played the frisky sibling of [[Thomas Jane]]'s character in the feature film ''[[The Sweetest Thing]]''.

In 2003, Bateman was cast as [[Michael Bluth]] in the comedy series ''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]]''. Although critically acclaimed, the series never achieved high ratings&lt;ref name=actors/&gt; and ended on February 10, 2006. The show was revived in spring 2013. Bateman won several awards for his work on the series, including a [[Golden Globe]] for ''[[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Television Series Musical or Comedy|Best Actor in a Television Series Musical or Comedy]]''. He was also nominated in 2005 for the ''[[Emmy Award]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/jason-bateman|title=Jason Bateman - Television Academy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; for Outstanding Actor in a Comedy Series. New episodes of Arrested Development have been released on Netflix with the original cast, including Bateman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/04/new-arrested-development-season-coming-to-netflix-on-may-26/|title=New 'Arrested Development' Season Coming to Netflix on May 26|date=April 4, 2013|last=Itzkoff|first=Dave|authorlink=David Itzkoff|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=August 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bateman performed commentary on the [[2004 Democratic National Convention]] for ''[[The Majority Report]]'' with ''Arrested Development'' co-star [[David Cross]], and hosted [[NBC]]'s ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' on February 12, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;The ''SNL'' Archives.

Retrieved October 8, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, he appeared as a guest star on the ''[[Scrubs (TV Series)|Scrubs]]'' episode "[[My Big Bird]]" as ''Mr. Sutton'', a garbage man with a flock of vicious [[ostrich]]es as pets. In 2009, Bateman became a regular voice actor for the short-lived Fox comedy series ''[[Sit Down, Shut Up (U.S. TV series)|Sit Down, Shut Up]]''. He voiced Larry Littlejunk, the gym teacher and only staff member who can teach.&lt;ref name="sdsu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sitdownshutupwiki.fox.com/?t=anon |title=Sit Down, Shut Up |publisher=Fox |accessdate=April 14, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417045348/http://sitdownshutupwiki.fox.com/?t=anon |archivedate=April 17, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Bateman and ''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]]'' co-star [[Will Arnett]] created "DumbDumb Productions," a production company focusing on digital content. Their first video was "Prom Date," the first in a series of "Dirty Shorts" for [[Orbit (gum)|Orbit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Bateman-Arnett-Orbit-1019545.aspx|title=Jason Bateman and Will Arnett Reunite for Web Video|work=[[TV Guide]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Bateman returned to his role of Michael Bluth for the revival of ''Arrested Development'' along with the rest of the original cast. The now-[[Netflix]] sponsored series released Season 4 on its Instant Watch website on May 26, 2013. The series was expected to continue its run as well as a potential feature film. For the new fourth season, Bateman was once again nominated for Outstanding Actor in a Comedy Series. Netflix confirmed that the entire cast of the show will be returning for a fifth season, premiering 29th May 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/arrested-development-season-5-netflix-1202430144//|title=‘Arrested Development’ Officially Returning for Season 5 at Netflix|website=Variety|access-date=2018-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Bateman returned to television as both actor and director in the [[Netflix]] drama ''[[Ozark (TV series)|Ozark]]'', in which he plays a financial advisor who must relocate his family to Missouri in order to launder money for a Mexican drug cartel. Bateman's performance as Marty Byrde has drawn positive comparisons to [[Bryan Cranston]]'s portrayal of Walter White in [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]]'s ''[[Breaking Bad]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/breaking-bad-fans-have-found-their-new-fix-in-jason-bateman-starrer-ozark/]{{cite web|url=https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/breaking-bad-fans-have-found-their-new-fix-in-jason-bateman-starrer-ozark/|title=Breaking Bad Fans Have Found Their New Fix in Jason Bateman–Starrer Ozark|date=August 4, 2017|last=Reiher|first=Andrea|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=August 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
