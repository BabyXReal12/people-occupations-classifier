'''Jonathan Joseph Heder''' ({{IPAc-en|'|h|iː|d|ər}}) (born October 26, 1977)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmreference.com/film/74/Jon-Heder.html Jon Heder profile], FilmReference.com; accessed February 7, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; is an American [[actor]] and producer. His feature film debut came in 2004 as the title character of the comedy film ''[[Napoleon Dynamite]]''. He has also acted in the films ''[[The Benchwarmers]]'', ''[[School for Scoundrels (2006 film)|School for Scoundrels]]'', ''[[Blades of Glory]]'', ''[[Mama's Boy]]'', ''[[When in Rome (2010 film)|When in Rome]]'', and ''[[Walt Before Mickey]]'' as [[Roy O. Disney|Roy Disney]], and provided voice talents in the animated films ''[[Monster House (film)|Monster House]]'' and ''[[Surf's Up (film)|Surf's Up]]'', as well as the ''[[Napoleon Dynamite (TV series)|Napoleon Dynamite]]'' animated series.

==Early life==
&lt;!--Please do not insert information about his nieces and nephews. It is irrelevant.--&gt;Heder was born in [[Fort Collins, Colorado]], the son of Helen (née Brammer) and Dr. James Heder, a practicing physician. He has an [[identical twin]] brother,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribute.ca/people/Jon+Heder/12666|title=Jon Heder biography and filmography |publisher=Tribute.ca|accessdate=2014-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dan, as well as an older sister and brother, Rachel and Doug, and two younger brothers, Adam and Matt. Heder is the nephew by marriage of former [[National Football League|NFL]] [[running back]] and [[WCAU]] sportscaster, [[Vai Sikahema]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philly.com/mld/philly/entertainment/columnists/dan_gross/14429877.htm "Dan Gross: Vai not big fan of actor/kin"] article from Philly.com&lt;/ref&gt; Heder is of part Swedish descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=B. Alan Orange|url=http://www.movieweb.com/news/NEoUJqqovQY7ss|title=Shia LaBeouf and Jon Heder Compete for Waves in 'Surf's Up'|publisher=Movieweb.com|date=2007-06-04|accessdate=2014-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heder and his parents moved to [[Salem, Oregon]], when he was about two years old.&lt;ref name=oregonian-jan2012&gt;{{cite news|last=Owen|first=Rob|title=Heder returns as 'Dynamite' gets animated|date=January 12, 2012|newspaper=[[The Oregonian]]|page=E1|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/movies/index.ssf/2012/01/jon_heder_returns_as_animated.html|accessdate=April 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He attended Walker Middle School in Salem and graduated from [[South Salem High School]] in 1996,&lt;ref name=oregonian-jan2012/&gt; where he was on the swim team and was a member of the Drama Association. 

A 2002 alumnus of [[Brigham Young University]], Heder worked on the short [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] animated film ''Pet Shop'', written by Logan Deans, which earned a non-traditional animation student Emmy in 2005. After his movie career took off, he did not return to complete the work he started on the short, although his name does appear in the credits. While attending BYU he befriended [[Jared Hess]] and starred in Hess' short film ''[[Peluca]]'', which was later expanded into ''[[Napoleon Dynamite]]''.  ''Peluca'' received rave reviews on the BYU campus after showing at a few college and local film festivals and competitions.

==Career==
''[[Napoleon Dynamite]]'', filmed in [[Preston, Idaho]], earned $44.5 million at the box office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/napoleon_dynamite|title=Napoleon Dynamite|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=February 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2005, Heder received the [[MTV Movie Award]] for Best Musical Performance and Breakthrough Male Performance for the role. On October 8, 2005, he hosted ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' with musical guest [[Ashlee Simpson]]. After his success with ''Napoleon Dynamite'', Heder and his film co-star [[Efren Ramirez]] filmed a series of commercials to promote the Utah's 2005 [[State fair|State Fair]]. They reprised their roles in a [[self-parody]] sketch called "[[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon Bonamite]]" on the animated series ''[[Robot Chicken]]''. {{cn|date=February 2015}}

Heder appeared in the film ''[[The Sasquatch Gang]]''. He had a supporting role as a clerk in a new age bookstore in the [[romantic comedy]] ''[[Just Like Heaven (film)|Just Like Heaven]]''. Heder also appeared with [[Rob Schneider]] and [[David Spade]] in producer [[Adam Sandler]]'s ''[[The Benchwarmers]]'' (2006), a comedy about three grown men making up for lost chances by creating their own [[Little League]] [[baseball]] team. He was the voice of the character Skull in the animated film ''[[Monster House (film)|Monster House]]'', and starred in the comedy ''[[School for Scoundrels (2006 film)|School for Scoundrels]]'', opposite [[Billy Bob Thornton]] and [[Jacinda Barrett]]. With the exception of the Academy Award-nominee ''Monster House'', Heder's post-''Dynamite'' movies were widely panned{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} and he risked becoming a [[one-hit wonder]] until he co-starred in 2007 with [[Will Ferrell]] in the well-received ''[[Blades of Glory]]'' (2007). Like many of Heder's films, ''Blades of Glory'' is an absurd, slapstick caricature, in this case revolving around rival male figure skaters who must team up in a pairs competition.

Heder's second turn at voice acting came in 2007 when he voiced the character of Chicken Joe, a surfing chicken, in the animated film ''[[Surf's Up (film)|Surf's Up]]''. His first foray into web television was in the 2008 web series ''[[Woke Up Dead]]'' starring and produced by Heder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.tubefilter.tv/2008/07/28/jon-heder-to-star-in-and-produce-electric-farms-woke-up-dead/ Jon Heder To Star in Electric Farm’s ‘Woke Up Dead’]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Woke Up Dead'' is a web-based, live-action sci-fi comedy thriller about Drex, a twenty-something USC student who wakes up underwater in the bathtub one morning and suspects that he might be dead.

Heder and his twin brother, Dan, star together as villains in the fourth installment of the popular internet martial arts comedy series ''[[Sockbaby]]''. Heder's performance in ''[[When in Rome (2010 film)|When in Rome]]'' was praised by ''[[New York Times]]'' critic [[A. O. Scott]]: "Jon Heder as a goofy street magician is the funniest of the bunch."&lt;ref&gt;Chris Hicks. ''[[Deseret News]]'', February 5, 2010, p. W1&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Heder returned to the role that made him famous by supplying the voice of Napoleon Dynamite in the [[Fox Network]] animated series, ''[[Napoleon Dynamite (TV series)|Napoleon Dynamite]]'', which debuted in January 2012. In 2013, Heder appeared in the music video for "[[On Top of the World (Imagine Dragons song)|On Top of the World]]" with numerous other Utah-based actors and musicians, and in 2014 he appeared in the music video for the [[Chromeo]] song "Old 45s".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chromeo - Old 45's|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y44jY-DrLYM&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=4m42s|accessdate=March 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017, Heder reprised his role as Chicken Joe in the [[Surf's Up 2: WaveMania|direct-to video sequel]] to ''Surf's Up''.

==Personal life==
Heder has been married to Kirsten Bales since 2002. The couple met while they were studying at [[Brigham Young University]]. They have four children, one daughter named Evan, and two sons named Philip and Timothy. In July 2016, the couple announced that they were expecting another child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.etonline.com/news/192654_jon_heder_and_wife_kirsten_expecting_baby_number_four/ |title=Jon Heder and Wife Expecting Baby No. 4 -- See Their Cute Announcement! |author=Murphy, Desiree |website=Entertainment Tonight |date=July 6, 2016 |accessdate=September 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They welcomed their fourth child, a daughter, on December 16 of the same year.

Like his brothers and father, Heder is a [[Scouting]] enthusiast having achieved the rank of [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]].&lt;ref name=NPR/&gt; In 2010, he served as a [[Scoutmaster#United States of America|Scoutmaster]] for the organization.&lt;ref name="NPR"&gt;{{cite news|title=Boy Scouts Prepared To Celebrate A Century|newspaper=[[National Public Radio]]|date=February 6, 2010|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=123439540|accessdate=February 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heder is a member of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]. He voiced support for [[Mitt Romney]] in the 2012 United States presidential election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vulture.com/2012/01/jon-heder-on-napoleon-dynamite-avoiding-raunchy-roles-and-fellow-mormon-mitt-romney.html |title=Jon Heder on Napoleon Dynamite, Avoiding Raunchy Roles, and Fellow Mormon Mitt Romney |author=Marsh, Steve |website=Vulture |date=January 11, 2012 |accessdate=September 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
