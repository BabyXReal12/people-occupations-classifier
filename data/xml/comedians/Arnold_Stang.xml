'''Arnold Stang''' (September 28, 1918&amp;nbsp;– December 20, 2009)&lt;ref name="Weber"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/22/arts/television/22stang.html?_r=1&amp;ref=obituaries Weber, Bruce. "Arnold Stang, Milquetoast Actor, Dies at 91," ''The New York Times'', Tuesday 22 December 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt; was an American [[comedian|comic]] [[actor]] in radio, television and film, and television and film voice actor, whose [[comic persona]] was a small and bespectacled, yet brash and knowing big-city type.

==Career==
Stang once claimed he got his break in radio by sending a postcard to a New York station requesting an audition, was accepted, and then bought his own ticket to New York from [[Chelsea, Massachusetts]], with the money set aside for his mother's anniversary gift.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, August 3, 1947&lt;/ref&gt; True or not, Stang worked on New York-based network radio shows as a boy, appearing on children's programs such as ''[[The Horn and Hardart Children's Hour]]'' and ''Let's Pretend''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goldenage-wtic.org/gaor-51.html|title=gaor-51|website=www.goldenage-wtic.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1940, he had graduated to teenaged roles, appearing as Seymour&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lesser|first1=Jerry|title=Radio Talent: New York|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Billboard/40s/1942/Billboard%201942-01-10.o.pdf|accessdate=3 February 2015|agency=Billboard|date=January 10, 1942}}&lt;/ref&gt; on ''[[The Goldbergs (broadcast series)|The Goldbergs]]''. Director Don Bernard hired him in October 1941 to do the commercials on the [[Columbia Broadcasting Company|CBS]] program ''Meet Mr. Meek'' but decided his constantly cracking voice would hurt the commercial so he ordered scriptwriters to come up with a role for him.&lt;ref&gt;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Oct. 26. 1941&lt;/ref&gt; He next appeared on the summer replacement show ''The Remarkable Miss Tuttle'' with [[Edna May Oliver]] in 1942&lt;ref&gt;Chicago Tribune, July 19, 1942&lt;/ref&gt; and replaced [[Eddie Firestone]] Jr. in the title role of ''That Brewster Boy'' when Firestone joined the U.S. Marine Corps in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Chicago Tribune, Sept. 3, 1943&lt;/ref&gt;

Comedian [[Henry Morgan (comedian)|Henry Morgan]] made him a sidekick on his program in fall of 1946 and Stang appeared in similar roles the following year on radio shows with [[Eddie Cantor]]&lt;ref&gt;Miami News, Sept. 25, 1947&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Milton Berle]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; He also did the voice of [[Jughead Jones|Jughead]] for a short while on [[Archie Andrews#Archie on radio|The Archie radio show]]''.

At this time Stang had appeared in a number of movies, including ''Seven Days Leave'', ''[[My Sister Eileen]]'', ''[[So This Is New York (film)|So This Is New York]]'' with Henry Morgan, and ''[[They Got Me Covered]]''. He had also appeared on the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] stage in ''[[Sailor Beware! (play)|Sailor Beware]]'', ''All In Favor'' and ''Same Time Next Week'', where he first worked with Berle.&lt;ref&gt;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, August 3, 1947.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stang moved to television at the start of the Golden Age. He had a recurring role in the TV show ''[[The School House]]'' on the [[DuMont Television Network]] in 1949. He was a regular on [[Eddie Mayehoff]]'s short-lived situation comedy ''[[Doc Corkle]]'' in fall of 1952&lt;ref&gt;Hedda Hopper syndicated column, September 10, 1952&lt;/ref&gt; as well as comedy relief on ''[[Captain Video and His Video Rangers]]'' as Clumsy McGee. Then he made a guest appearance on Milton Berle's ''[[Texaco Star Theater]]'' on May 12, 1953&lt;ref&gt;San Mateo Times, May 12, 1953&lt;/ref&gt; and joined him as a regular as Francis the Stagehand the following September, often berating or heckling the big-egoed star for big laughs. Stang also had guest roles on several variety shows of the day including ''[[The Colgate Comedy Hour]]''. In early 1951, Stang appeared on ''[[Henry Morgan's Great Talent Hunt]]'', a take-off of ''[[The Original Amateur Hour]]'', as "Gerard", supposedly recruiting "talent" for Morgan.

In films, he played Sparrow in ''[[The Man with the Golden Arm]]'' (1955) with [[Frank Sinatra]] and [[Kim Novak]]. In ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' (1963) he played Ray, who, along with his partner Irwin ([[Marvin Kaplan]]), owns a gas station that [[Jonathan Winters]] destroys. He appeared in ''[[Hello Down There]]'' (1969). In one of the oddest movie pairings, he partnered with [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] (billed as "Arnold Strong 'Mr. Universe'") in the latter's first film, the [[camp (style)|camp]] classic ''[[Hercules in New York]]'' (1969).

Stang worked often as a voice actor for animated cartoons.&lt;ref&gt;Obituary ''[[The Guardian|London Guardian]]'', March 102010.&lt;/ref&gt; He is perhaps best known in this field as the voice of "T.C.," the sly alley cat in the Hanna-Barbera series ''[[Top Cat]]'' (modeled explicitly after Sgt. Bilko in ''[[The Phil Silvers Show]]''). The show lasted one season in prime time, 1961–62, before going into reruns. Stang also provided the voice for [[Popeye]]'s pal Shorty (a caricature of Stang), [[Herman and Katnip|Herman]] the mouse in a number of [[Famous Studios]] cartoons, Tubby Tompkins in a few [[Little Lulu]] shorts, and Catfish on ''[[Misterjaw]]''. He also voiced the character Nurtle the Twurtle in the 1965 animated feature ''[[Pinocchio in Outer Space]]''.

On television he appeared in [[Television advertisement|commercials]] for the [[Nestlé Chunky|Chunky]] candy bar, where he would list many of its ingredients, smile and say, "Chunky, what a chunk of chocolate!" He provided the voice of the [[Honey Nut Cheerios]] Bee in the 1980s and was also a spokesman for [[Vicks|Vicks Vapo-Rub]]. As a pitchman for [[Alcoa]] aluminum window screens in the late 1960s, he was known for the tag line "Arnold Stang says don't get stung".  Stang also appeared in "The Grave Robber," an episode of the popular horror anthology series [[Tales from the Darkside]], playing Tapok, an ancient Egyptian mummy who encounters some unscrupulous archaeologists that lure him into a game of strip poker.

Stang once described himself as "a frightened chipmunk who's been out in the rain too long."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; As for his distinctive squawky, nasal [[Brooklyn]] voice, he said "I'm kind of attached to it...[it's] a personal logo. It's like your [[Jell-O]] or [[Xerox]].&lt;ref&gt;Nachman, Raised on Radio (1998), pg. 478; Stang interviewed on Oct. 21, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;
 &lt;!--Unclear if rest of this paragraph is from the book Raised on Radio, in which case a citation with page number is needed, particularly for any claimed quotes, or if this is from Nachman's personal reminiscence here, in which case it is disallowed as [[WP:NOR]]. --- He was the son of Harold and Anna (Chest) Stang. He began performing at the age of nine in radio shows such as ''[[Let's Pretend]]'', eventually playing in dramas and mysteries as what he once called "little killers," according to radio historian Gerald Nachman (''Raised on Radio''). He told Nachman that he knew his nasal voice was his meal ticket. "I'm kind of attached to it," he quipped to Nachman. "My personal logo. It's like [[Jell-O]] or [[Xerox]]." He also told Nachman that the bulk of his fan mail does not even address his film or television work. "All about my radio career," he said.--&gt;

===Later career===
Arnold Stang reprised Top Cat in ''[[Yogi's Treasure Hunt]]'' and ''[[Top Cat and the Beverly Hills Cats]]''. Stang also appeared on an episode of ''[[The Cosby Show]]'' with guest star [[Sammy Davis, Jr.]] (He also made a cameo appearance in Cosby's 1990 film ''[[Ghost Dad]]''.) In one TV advertisement he played [[Luther Burbank]], proudly showing off his newly invented "[[square tomato]]" to fit neatly in typical square slices of commercial bread, then being informed that the advertising bakery had beat him to it by producing round loaves of bread. He played the photographer in the 1993 film [[Dennis the Menace (film)|''Dennis the Menace'']] with [[Walter Matthau]]. He also provided many voices for the [[Cartoon Network]] series ''[[Courage the Cowardly Dog]]'' and The [[Turner Program Services]]'s original series, ''[[Captain Planet and the Planeteers]]''. He had a small role as Queasy the Parrot in the 1970s film [[Raggedy Ann and Andy: A Musical Adventure]].

In 1994, he guest starred as the voice of Irwin the Mouse in ''[[Garfield and Friends]]'' episode, "Thoroughly Mixed-Up Mouse".

In 2000, writers [[Kurt Seligmann]], Jr. and [[Martin Olson]] asked Stang to use his voice to talk to Pikachu in ''[[Hey You, Pikachu!]]''.

In 2004, Arnold Stang made his last appearance in an interview with animator Earl Kress about the making of ''Top Cat''. It is featured on the Top Cat DVD boxset.

==Personal life==
Stang and his wife, the former JoAnne Taggart, lived in [[New Rochelle, New York]] and in his later years [[Greenwich, Connecticut]], moving toward the end of his life to [[Needham, Massachusetts]]. The Stangs had two children, David and Deborah.&lt;ref name="Weber"/&gt;

==Death==
{{Wikinews|American actor Arnold Stang dies at age 91}}
Stang died of [[pneumonia]] in [[Newton, Massachusetts]], on December 20, 2009.&lt;ref name="Weber"/&gt; Although Stang was born in New York City in 1918, he often claimed [[Chelsea, Massachusetts]] as his birthplace and 1925 as his birthdate.&lt;ref name="Weber"/&gt; His ashes were buried in Newton's cemetery.
