'''Brendon Small''' (born February 15, 1975) is an American [[screenwriting|writer]], [[television producer|producer]], [[voice acting|voice actor]], [[stand-up comedy|stand-up comedian]], [[animator]] and [[musician]] best known as the co-creator of the [[animated series]] ''[[Home Movies (TV series)|Home Movies]]'' (along with [[Loren Bouchard]]) and ''[[Metalocalypse]]'' (along with [[Tommy Blacha]]) and as the creator of the virtual [[death metal]] band [[Dethklok]].

== Early career ==
Small started learning guitar at age 14 after a kid in his neighborhood began teaching him about guitar and music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://admin42.vampirefreaks.com/content/comment.php?entry=541&amp;t=Interview+with+Brendon+Small+%28Metalocalypse%2C+Dethklok%2C+and+Galaktikon |title=Interview with Brendon Small (Metalocalypse, Dethklok, and Galaktikon |publisher=VampireFreaks.com |date=May 22, 2012 |accessdate=April 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At his first public performance his hands shook so wildly that he had trouble controlling the guitar. It was another ten years before he was comfortable performing in public.&lt;ref name="libsyn1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wtfpod.libsyn.com/index.php?post_id=583771 |title=WTF with Marc Maron Podcast, #48 |date=February 18, 2010 |accessdate=November 10, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716074337/http://wtfpod.libsyn.com/index.php?post_id=583771|archivedate=July 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from Palma High School in Salinas, California. He graduated from [[Berklee College of Music]] in 1997.  During his music studies he concurrently took several writing and comedy classes at [[Emerson College]].  After graduating, he felt that the rock music genre was fading in popularity so decided to try his hand at comedy.&lt;ref name="libsyn1"/&gt;

He was performing at The Comedy Studio in [[Harvard Square]] when he was spotted by [[Loren Bouchard]], who at the time was casting for the central character for a [[UPN]] pilot produced by [[Tom Snyder Productions]] which eventually evolved into ''[[Home Movies (TV series)|Home Movies]]''.

== Career ==

=== Media ===
Brendon Small was the co-creator, writer, voice actor, composer and musician for ''[[Home Movies (TV series)|Home Movies]]'', a cartoon initially aired on the UPN television network and then moved to [[Cartoon Network]]'s [[Adult Swim]].  The final episode of ''Home Movies'' aired on April 4, 2004, after running four seasons, although the show is periodically rerun on Adult Swim.  In the series, he voiced the show's protagonist, 8-year-old aspiring filmmaker Brendon Small, as well as a number of other characters.

Small lent his voice to a number of other animated shows.  He co-starred as Chad in the [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]] animated sit-com, ''[[Hey Monie!]]'', and has voiced many supporting characters in ''[[The Venture Bros.]]'', including that show's [[shell shock]]ed and drug-addicted version of [[Jonny Quest]].  Small has also had cameo roles in ''[[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]]'', ''[[Squidbillies]]'', ''[[Reno 911!]]'' and ''[[Frisky Dingo]]''.  Small along with [[Scott Adsit]] appeared as lead characters of the Adult Swim pilot ''Let's Fish''; the show's pilot premiered on May 13, 2007, but the series was not picked up.

In April 2005, the [[Sci Fi Channel (United States)|Sci Fi Channel]] announced an upcoming debut of a half-hour animated ensemble comedy show created by Small titled ''[[Barbarian Chronicles]]''.  The show, which has yet to be seen, was said to be produced by Small and [[Worldwide Pants Incorporated]]. Small has said that there are currently no plans to produce the show but that anything can happen in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lambgoat.com/features/interviews/brendon_small.aspx |title=Brendon Small (Metalocalypse) interview // Interviews // Features // Lambgoat |publisher=Lambgoat.com |date= |accessdate=December 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Small posed for a pictorial that appeared in the April 2006 issue of [[Playgirl]] magazine, as part of a humor-themed issue. Small posed naked holding a medieval flail and a strategically placed metal shield that hid his genitals.
Along with comedians [[Ron Lynch (comedian)|Ron Lynch]] and [[Craig Anton]], Small has hosted the "Tomorrow Show", a weekly live comedy show at the [[Steve Allen Theater]] in Los Angeles.

Small's latest television project is as co-producer, co-writer, composer, and voice actor for the Adult Swim series ''[[Metalocalypse]]'', which premiered on August 6, 2006.  The series focuses on a fictional [[death metal]] band named [[Dethklok]], and each episode features a song "performed" by the band.  In addition to all of the behind-the-scenes work he does for the series, he also provides voice talent for the characters [[Skwisgaar Skwigelf]], [[Pickles (Metalocalypse)|Pickles]], and [[Nathan Explosion]], three of the five members of Dethklok. Small has stated that while this is his dream job, he does not really like watching animation that much.&lt;ref name="libsyn1"/&gt;

In 2007 and 2009, Small hosted the [[Guitar Superstar]] competition and in September 2008 he was one of the judges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/press_releases/brendon_small_to_host_guitar_players_guitar_hero_2007_competition.html|title=Brendon Small To Host Guitar Player's Guitar Hero 2007 Competition|publisher=Ultimate Guitar|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110326235101/http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/press_releases/brendon_small_to_host_guitar_players_guitar_hero_2007_competition.html|archivedate=March 26, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Small directed [[Soundgarden]]'s music video for "[[Black Rain (Soundgarden song)|Black Rain]]", and [[The Damned Things]]' music video for "We've Got a Situation Here".

Small's virtual band [[Dethklok]] appeared, via video, at the 2009 ''Golden Gods Awards''. The band received the award for Best International Band. At the 2010 Golden Gods Awards, Small attended and performed with [[Brian Posehn]]'s band and introduced [[Fear Factory]]'s set. At the 2011 Golden Gods Awards, Small attended and introduced [[DevilDriver]]'s set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metalinjection.net/latest-news/revolver-golden-gods-awards-2011-winners-full-show-recap |title=REVOLVER GOLDEN GODS AWARDS 2011: The Winners &amp; Full Show Recap &amp;#124; Latest News |publisher=Metal Injection |date=April 23, 2011 |accessdate=December 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Small attended the 2012 ''Golden Gods Awards'' and introduced [[Trivium (band)|Trivium]]'s set. Small had been nominated for best guitarist at the 2013 Golden Gods Awards but did not win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metalinsider.net/award-show-battles/and-the-winners-of-the-revolver-golden-gods-awards-2013-are |title=AND THE WINNERS OF THE REVOLVER GOLDEN GODS AWARDS 2013 ARE... |publisher=metalinsider.net |date=May 3, 2013 |accessdate=May 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2012 Small finished work on the fourth season of ''Metalocalypse'', which began airing on April 29, 2012 and concluded July 15, 2012. The DVD was released on October 30, 2012.

On May 10, 2013, Small and [[Adult Swim]] announced that a one-hour [[rock opera]] Metalocalypse special, entitled ''[[Metalocalypse: The Doomstar Requiem]]'', was in the works.&lt;ref name="Adams, Gregory"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://exclaim.ca/News/metalocalypse_to_premiere_new_rock_opera_this_fall |title='Metalocalypse' to Premiere New Rock Opera This Fall |author= Adams, Gregory |date= May 10, 2013|accessdate=May 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It aired on October 27, 2013, and featured brand new music from [[Dethklok]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metalinjection.net/latest-news/metalocalypse-creator-reveals-dethklok-rock-opera-in-the-works |title=Metalocalypse Creator Reveals DETHKLOK Rock Opera in the Works |publisher= Metal Injection |author= RobInjection |date= May 10, 2013 |accessdate=May 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2014, Small wrote a column for [[Premier Guitar]] regarding his guitar techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.premierguitar.com/articles/20911-shredmental-the-dancer-and-the-drummer |title=Shredmental: The Dancer and the Drummer |author= Brendon Small |date=May 31, 2014 |accessdate=June 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Small appeared on [[Ken Reid (comedian)|Ken Reid]]'s ''TV Guidance Counselor Podcast'' on May 15, 2015. The episode was taped live on Sunday May 11 at the Doug Fir Lounge in Portland Oregon as part of the Bridgetown Comedy Festival.

=== Comedy ===
Throughout his adult life, Small has frequently performed stand-up comedy in the [[Los Angeles]] area. Small was one of the hosts (along with [[Ron Lynch (comedian)|Ron Lynch]] and [[Craig Anton]]) of ''The Tomorrow Show'', a live weekly musical and comedic variety show; in his off-time Small still occasionally appears as a guest.&lt;ref name="Small Comedy Bang Bang"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.earwolf.com/person/brendon-small |title=Earwolf Bio – Brendon Small |publisher=Earwolf.com |accessdate=August 28, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of his prominent forms of stand-up is character comedy, where he acts out a character he created to garner laughs. Some of the characters he has played are Captain Moustache, Victor Diamond, Tiny and Bernie Fretts, all of which he has performed as in the weekly comedy podcast ''[[Comedy Bang! Bang!]]''.&lt;ref name="Small Comedy Bang Bang"/&gt; In recent years Small's time has become booked from his music and television career, but he still occasionally performs stand-up at venues such as [[The Steve Allen Theater]], The Ice House and [[The Baked Potato]].

=== Music career ===
[[Image:Brendonguitar.JPG|thumb|left|Small performing live with Dethklok.]]
Small wrote all the music for the show [[Home Movies (TV series)|''Home Movies'']], and released all the songs he had written for the show on the [[Home Movies (season 4)#Home Movies: Bonus CD|''Home Movies'': Bonus CD]]. The CD was included with purchase of the [[Home Movies (season 4)|Season 4 DVD]] box set.

With his new series ''[[Metalocalypse]]'', Small continued to write all the music for the show. In September 2007, he completed work on the Dethklok album titled ''[[The Dethalbum]]'', in which he collaborated with [[Gene Hoglan]] to deliver an authentic [[melodic death metal]] sound while simultaneously retaining the light-hearted nature with which Small portrays the heavy metal genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stylusmagazine.com/reviews/dethklok/the-dethalbum.htm |title=Review of the '&amp;#39;Dethalbum'&amp;#39; in Stylus magazine |publisher=Stylusmagazine.com |date=October 15, 2007 |accessdate=October 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album debuted at No. 21 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], making it the highest-ranked [[death metal]] album on the Billboard at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1048649/rascal-flatts-races-to-no-1-in-debut-heavy-week |title=Katie Hasty, "Rascal Flatts Races To No. 1 in Debut-Heavy Week", Billboard.com|date=October 3, 2007 |publisher=Billboard.com |accessdate=December 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stylusmagazine.com/reviews/dethklok/the-dethalbum.htm |title=Review of the '&amp;#39;Dethalbum'&amp;#39; in Stylus magazine |publisher=Stylusmagazine.com |date= |accessdate=December 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2007, Small, Hoglan, [[Mike Keneally]] and [[Bryan Beller]] performed live as Dethklok at twelve US college campuses in support of ''The Dethalbum''.  The [[Adult Swim]]-sponsored "Dethtour" featured Dethklok supporting [[indie rock]] band [[...And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://movementnews.blogspot.com/2007/10/adult-swim-presents-trail-of-dead-and.html|title=Adult Swim Presents Trail of Dead and Dethklok National College Tour}}&lt;/ref&gt; The foursome reunited in 2008 to headline a longer "Dethtour", where they toured the US in June and early July with fellow metal bands [[Chimaira]] and [[Soilent Green]]. During the tour they released the [[...And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead/Dethklok]] split EP for free at the concerts.

The second Dethklok album, ''[[Dethalbum II]]'', was released on September 29, 2009. ''Dethalbum II'' reached No. 15 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], making it the highest charting [[death metal]] album in history. A tour in support of the new album began in late 2009, where Dethklok co-headlined with the band [[Mastodon (band)|Mastodon]].

Small performed guest vocals as Nathan Explosion on the [[Zimmers Hole]] song "The Vowel Song". Small also contributed guitar work to the songs "Devils Teeth" from [[Exodus (band)|Exodus]]'s album ''[[Exhibit B: The Human Condition]]'', as well as "More Metal Than You" from comedian [[Brian Posehn]]'s album ''[[Fart and Wiener Jokes]]''. Small created the "Murder Mix" of the song "Liar" by [[Emilie Autumn]] from the ''[[Liar/Dead Is the New Alive]]'' EP. Small performed the solo for the song "Get It Up" ([[Van Halen]] cover) on [[Sylencer]]s' debut album ''[[A Lethal Dose of Truth]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.noisecreep.com/2012/07/17/sylencer-a-lethal-dose-of-truth/ |title=Sylencer: the Unknown Chicago Musician Who Got An All-Star Lineup of Musicians to Play on His Debut Album |publisher=NoiseCreep |date=July 17, 2012 |accessdate=April 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Small performs a guitar solo on the song "Let's Make Out" on the Sex Slaves album ''Call of the Wild''.

In early 2011, Small introduced the Dethklok "Thunderhorse" Explorer from [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]], a guitar made to his own specifications, and modeled after Skwisgaar's Gibson Explorer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.gibson.com/Products/Electric-Guitars/Explorer/Gibson-USA/Dethklok-Thunderhorse-Explorer.aspx |title=Dethklok Thunderhorse Explorer webpage |publisher=Gibson.com |date=June 24, 2008 |accessdate=December 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004BSGXXK |title=Gibson Dethklok Explorer Electric Guitar: Musical Instruments |publisher=Amazon.com |date=September 9, 2009 |accessdate=December 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A limited edition [[Epiphone]] "Thunderhorse" Explorer, based on the Gibson "Thunderhorse" Explorer, was introduced in early 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epiphone.com/News/Features/Features/2013/Brendon-Small-Introduces-The-Epiphone-Thunderhorse.aspx |title=Brendon Small Introduces The Epiphone Thunderhorse To Dealers at NAMM |publisher=Epiphone.com |date=March 3, 2013 |accessdate=July 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2012, Small introduced the prototype for the Gibson Flying V "Snow Falcon", built to his own specifications, and modeled after Toki Wartooth's Gibson Flying V.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXpcFl0q0I4# |title=Brendon Small Interview Part 3 |publisher=YouTube |date=May 1, 2012 |accessdate=April 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final version of the guitar was released on December 13, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.gibson.com/Products/Electric-Guitars/Flying-V/Gibson-USA/Brendon-Small-Snow-Falcon-Flying-V.aspx |title=Brendon Small Snow Falcon Flying V |publisher=Gibson |accessdate=December 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2012 Small released his debut solo album, ''[[Brendon Small's Galaktikon]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fangoria.com/index.php/component/content/article/105-fangoria-musick/7012-qaa-qmetalocalypsesq-brendon-small-on-qgalaktikonq-and-more |title=Q&amp;A: "METALOCALYPSE's" Brendon Small on "GALAKTIKON" and more |publisher=Fangoria.com |date=May 3, 2011 |accessdate=May 3, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505030210/http://fangoria.com/index.php/component/content/article/105-fangoria-musick/7012-qaa-qmetalocalypsesq-brendon-small-on-qgalaktikonq-and-more |archivedate=May 5, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The album featured Dethklok members Beller on bass and Hoglan on drums. Small described the album as a "high-stakes, intergalactic, extreme rock album" and described it as being similar to Dethklok but with more melodic vocals and rock elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyblam.com/news/2011/07/15/dethklok-creator-brendon-small-talks-solo-project-due-this-summer |title=DETHKLOK Creator Brendon Small Talks Solo Project Due This Summer |publisher=DailyBlam.com |date=July 15, 2011 |accessdate=September 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Small performed songs from ''Brendon Small's Galaktikon'' for the first time at "WesFest 8" on March 3, 2013, in [[West Hollywood]], California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weswehmiller.net/wesfest/wesfest-8/ |title=Wesfest 8 |publisher=weswehmiller.net |accessdate=April 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 29, 2012, Small started a weekly guitar lesson video series on the [[adult swim]] YouTube channel, entitled "Shreducation", which consisted of 12 installments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ9gt__g8A0&amp;feature=youtu.be| title=Weekly Shred-ucation with Brendon Small: Lesson Twelve: Badass Tappy Thing | accessdate=July 13, 2012 | date=July 13, 2012  | publisher=Youtube.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Small, Beller and Hoglan got together to work on the third Dethklok album, ''[[Dethalbum III]]'', which was released on October 16, 2012. Small released a fourth Dethklok album, entitled ''[[The Doomstar Requiem]]'', on October 29, 2013, which is a soundtrack album to the ''Metalocalypse'' [[Metalocalypse: The Doomstar Requiem|special of the same name]]. The album featured Hoglan on drums, Beller performing guest bass on a track, and [[Mike Keneally]] performing guest vocals.

Small released a follow-up record to his debut album, entitled ''[[Brendon Small's Galaktikon II]]'' in 2017.

== BS Records ==
In 2012 Small self-released his solo album, ''Brendon Small's Galaktikon'', independently on his personal record label BS Records. He funded the album himself, and used all of the profits he received from the album to fund future projects. In 2013 Small made the decision to release the fourth Dethklok album, ''[[The Doomstar Requiem]]'', on his personal label (as opposed to the usual [[Williams Street Records]]) because he wanted to make sure there was a future for Dethklok's music.&lt;ref name= "Dunlop"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jimdunlop.com/blog/dunlop-on-the-record-brendon-small-dethklok/ |title=Dunlop on the Record: Brendon Small / Dethklok |publisher=JimDunlop.com |date=October 30, 2013 |accessdate=November 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He explained that if he had not done this, ''[[Dethalbum III]]'' would have been the last Dethklok record released. He went on to explain that the only way to keep Dethklok's music going was by making this personal investment, regardless of whether or not it would be financially beneficial to him.&lt;ref name= "Dunlop" /&gt;

== Personal life ==
