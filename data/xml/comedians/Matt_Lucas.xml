'''Matthew Richard Lucas''' (born 5 March 1974) is an English comedian, screenwriter, actor and singer, best known for his work with [[David Walliams]] in the television show ''[[Little Britain]]'', as well as for his portrayals of the scorekeeping baby Georgie Dawes in the comedy [[panel game]] ''[[Shooting Stars (TV series)|Shooting Stars]]'', both [[Tweedledum and Tweedledee|Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee]] in ''[[Alice in Wonderland (2010 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'' and its sequel, ''[[Alice Through the Looking Glass (2016 film)|Alice Through the Looking Glass]]'', and [[Nardole]] in the [[Doctor Who (series 10)|tenth series]] of ''[[Doctor Who]]''.

==Early life==
Lucas was born in [[Paddington]], London, the son of Diana (née Williams) (born 1945) and John Stanley Lucas (1944–1996), who ran a chauffeuring business. He is from a [[Jewish]] family;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Matt Lucas Comedy Profile |work=BBC |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/people/matt_lucas_person_page.shtml |accessdate=24 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; some of Lucas's mother's family fled from Germany just before the [[Second World War]]. Lucas has had [[Alopecia universalis|alopecia]] since his childhood, and lost all of his hair when he was six years old.&lt;ref name=es1&gt;{{cite news |title=Matt Lucas has the last laugh |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/matt-lucas-has-the-last-laugh-7256366.html |first=Alison |last=Bowyer |newspaper=[[Evening Standard]] |date=26 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lucas's father died of a heart attack aged 52 in [[London Borough of Brent|Brent]], [[Greater London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article6408740.ece?token=null&amp;offset=24&amp;page=3 |title=Matt Lucas on fame, body image and relationships|first=Robert |last=Crampton |newspaper=The Times|date=6 June 2009|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
Lucas was educated at Aylward Primary School and [[The Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School]], an [[independent school]] in [[Borehamwood]] in [[Hertfordshire]], the same school attended by comic actors [[David Baddiel]] and [[Sacha Baron Cohen]]. He studied at the [[University of Bristol]] between 1993 and 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bristol.ac.uk/alumni/alumni-stories/prominent-alumni/tv-film-and-theatre/ |title=TV, film and theatre - Alumni and friends |website=University of Bristol |accessdate=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also spent time with the [[National Youth Theatre]], where he first met future writing partner [[David Walliams]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Matt Lucas urges future stars to join youth theatre that inspired him |url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/showbiz/matt-lucas-urges-future-stars-to-join-youth-theatre-that-inspired-him-6777859.html |newspaper=[[London Evening Standard]] |date=23 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Lucas's association with [[Vic Reeves]] and [[Bob Mortimer]] began in 1992. In 1995, Lucas appeared in ''[[The Smell of Reeves and Mortimer]]''. He went on to star with them in ''[[Shooting Stars (TV series)|Shooting Stars]]''. He quickly rose to fame as George Dawes, the giant baby, who would deliver a string of meaningless gags (often in character) and insults before delivering the score, while sitting at and playing a drum kit, often dressed in an adult-sized [[romper suit]]. He also appeared on occasion as [[Marjorie Dawes]], George's mother, who also appears in ''[[Little Britain]]''.

He again appeared with Reeves &amp; Mortimer in the BBC series ''[[Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased) (2000 TV series)|Randall &amp; Hopkirk]]'', and ''[[Catterick (TV series)|Catterick]]'' in a variety of roles. In 1999, Lucas paired with [[David Walliams]], with whom he had already worked in both ''[[Mash and Peas]]'' and ''[[Sir Bernard's Stately Homes]]'', to create ''[[Rock Profile]]'', a comedy show that spoofed famous musicians and musical personalities. It is notable for being one of their first comedic collaborations. Lucas has also written for actor [[Sacha Baron Cohen]].

His music video appearances include the [[Damien Hirst]]-directed video for [[Blur (band)|Blur]]'s "[[Country House]]", "Jesusland" by [[Ben Folds]] in 2005, "[[I'm with Stupid (Pet Shop Boys song)|I'm with Stupid]]" by the [[Pet Shop Boys]] and "[[Vindaloo (song)|Vindaloo]]" and "Naughty Christmas" by [[Fat Les]].

Lucas ventured into the world of stage musicals in 2002, when he took a role in [[Boy George]]'s musical ''[[Taboo (musical)|Taboo]]'' at The Venue, London. He played the performance artist [[Leigh Bowery]].

===''Little Britain''===
''[[Little Britain]]'' is Lucas's most commercially successful work. Originally a radio show on [[BBC Radio 4]], it later became a TV series. Among the many characters he plays in the series, which he writes and acts in along with David Walliams, are apparently "disabled" [[Andy Pipkin]], teenage Bristol [[chav]] [[Vicky Pollard]], [[homophobic]] homosexual [[Daffyd Thomas]], and insensitive slimming club organiser [[Marjorie Dawes]]. In January 2005 Lucas and Walliams were named the [[Radio Times's Most Powerful People in TV Comedy|most powerful people in TV comedy]] by ''[[Radio Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Methven|first1=Nicola|date=11 January 2005|title=Lucas &amp; Walliams 'funniest'|url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Lucas+%26+Walliams+%27funniest%27-a0126878529|newspaper=[[Daily Mirror]]|location=London|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|issn=|oclc=223228477|access-date=13 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===After ''Little Britain''===
In 2005, he took his first role in a television drama, a supporting part as a [[Venice|Venetian]] duke in the BBC historical serial ''[[Casanova (2005 TV serial)|Casanova]]'', written by [[Russell T Davies]]. Also in 2005, he did voice work in the ITV children's program ''[[King Arthur's Disasters]]'' alongside [[Rik Mayall]]. Since 2006, Lucas has been the voice of the radio and television character [[Digit Al]], devised as part of a public information campaign on [[Digital terrestrial television in the United Kingdom#Digital switchover|digital switchover]]. On 26 November 2006 he appeared on the [[BBC Radio 4]] programme ''[[Desert Island Discs]]''. He made a cameo appearance in ''[[Shaun of the Dead]]'' as Tom, the cousin of Shaun's friend Yvonne.

In 2007, he released "[[I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)|I'm Gonna Be]]", originally by [[The Proclaimers]], with [[Peter Kay]] as a [[charity single]] for [[Comic Relief (charity)|Comic Relief]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mutual Relief: Lucas and Kay join for charity single|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2006/11/17/4713/mutual_relief|work=Chortle|date=17 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He performed the single as ''Little Britain'' character [[Andy Pipkin]], along with Kay playing as [[Phoenix Nights|Brian Potter]]. He also starred as [[Mr. Toad]] in  ''[[The Wind in the Willows (2006 film)|The Wind in the Willows]]'', a 2006 television adaptation of the [[Kenneth Grahame]] novel.

He has appeared in ''[[Kath &amp; Kim (Australian TV series)|Kath &amp; Kim]]'' and ''[[Neighbours]]'' (the latter alongside David Walliams as ''Little Britain'' characters [[Lou and Andy]]), as well as a cameo role, playing 'Chris' or 'Jammy' at the wedding fayre, in the [[BBC Three]] sitcom ''[[Gavin &amp; Stacey]]''. Lucas has co-written (with Walliams) and performed in a new series of ''[[Little Britain USA]]'' for [[HBO]].

Lucas was the first celebrity to appear in 2008's ''[[Big Brother Celebrity Hijack]]'' on [[E4 (channel)|E4]].

On 9 April 2009, the series ''[[Kröd Mändoon and the Flaming Sword of Fire]]'', featuring Lucas as a regular performer, premièred on [[Comedy Central]], the first major comedy series which Lucas had worked on since ''Little Britain''. In 2010, Lucas played [[Tweedledee and Tweedledum]] in [[Tim Burton]]'s ''[[Alice in Wonderland (2010 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117991998.html|title=Matt Lucas at Variety Players|date=10 September 2008|author=Byron Perry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in February 2010, Lucas began hosting his own radio show, ''[[And The Winner Is (radio)|And The Winner Is]]'', in which he handed out a fictional series of awards based on nominations by his guests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00rbpbj|title=BBC Radio 2 – And The Winner Is|date=February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 October 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Akbar|first=Arifa|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/news/matt-lucas-lands-role-in-misrables-special-1990018.html|title=Matt Lucas lands role in 'Misérables' special|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=3 June 2010|accessdate=3 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matt played [[Thénardiers|Thénardier]] in the 25th Anniversary Concerts of ''[[Les Misérables (musical)|''Les Misérables]]'', at the [[The O2 Arena (London)|O2 Arena]] in London. A year later, from 23 June to 10 September 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.londontheatre.co.uk/theatre-news/news/les-miserables-cast-changes-at-queens-from-23-june|title=Les Miserables new cast at Queen's Theatre from 23 June include Matt Lucas, Alfie Boe, Hadley Fraser|work=London Theatre.co.uk|accessdate=3 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; he reprised the role at [[Queen's Theatre|The Queen's Theatre]], in the West End. He has since collaborated with [[Alfie Boe]], who played [[Jean Valjean]], to record a duet of "The Impossible Dream" on Boe's debut album.

Also in 2011, Lucas lent his voice to the CGI film ''[[Gnomeo and Juliet]]'', as well as playing a small role as the roommate of [[Kristen Wiig]] in the comedy ''[[Bridesmaids (2011 film)|''Bridesmaids]]''.

On Christmas Day 2010, the BBC began showing Lucas and David Walliams' new series, ''[[Come Fly with Me (2010 TV series)|''Come Fly with Me]]''. The show saw Walliams and Lucas each playing multiple characters but, unlike ''Little Britain'', it focused entirely on the working environment of the airline industry. In an interview shown on BBC 3 on 9 February 2011, it was stated that the creators considered bringing travel agent character Carol Beer from ''Little Britain'' to the new series, but decided against it, as they didn't want viewers to see the new show as merely a spinoff. Instead, all new characters were introduced.

On 28 March 2012, Lucas appeared as the "Generation X" guest on the Australian game show ''[[Talkin' 'Bout Your Generation]]''.

On 10 April 2012, Lucas's own BBC One show ''The Matt Lucas Awards'' began. It was a send-up of awards programme, with a panel of comedians giving their nominations for awards for a series of prizes concerning trivial topics.

Lucas also starred in the dark comedy ''[[Small Apartments]]'' released in February 2013 alongside James Caan, Billy Crystal, Johnny Knoxville, Juno Temple with other cameo performances by notable actors.

On 21 February 2013, Lucas appeared on the NBC series ''[[Community (TV series)|Community]]'' as Toby, an English friend of [[Abed Nadir]]. In 2014, Lucas played Ray Thomas in ''[[The Life of Rock with Brian Pern]]''.

Lucas launched a new comedy series called ''[[Pompidou (TV series)|Pompidou]]'' for [[BBC Two]]. The show began airing on 1 March 2015.

In May 2016, Lucas reprised his role as "Tweedledee/Tweedledum" in Tim Burton's ''[[Alice Through the Looking Glass (2016 film)|Alice Through the Looking Glass]],'' sequel to ''Alice in Wonderland.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://chicago.suntimes.com/news/alice-through-the-looking-glass-beware-the-poppycock-my-son/|title='Alice Through the Looking Glass': Beware the poppycock, my son!|newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times|access-date=2017-02-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 June 2016, it was announced Lucas would be joining the BBC series ''[[Doctor Who]]'' for its [[Doctor Who (series 10)|tenth series]], where he is set to reprise the character [[Nardole]], which he had played in the 2015 and 2016 Christmas specials, "[[The Husbands of River Song]]" and "[[The Return of Doctor Mysterio]]" respectively.

On 16 February 2017, Lucas was awarded an Honorary Degree "Doctor of Letters" by the University of Bristol, where he had studied for two years in the 1990s but had left before completing his degree course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-38990773 |title=Little Britain star Matt Lucas awarded honorary degree by Bristol University |date=16 February 2017 |work=BBC News |accessdate=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 October 2017, Lucas released his autobiography titled ''Little Me'', published by Canongate Books in hardback. The paperback edition was released on 7 June 2018&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://canongate.co.uk/books/2414-little-me-my-life-from-a-z/|title=Little Me by Matt Lucas - Canongate Books|date=3 October 2017|website=canongate.co.uk|accessdate=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In summer 2018 he will play Bill Snibson in a revival of ''[[Me and My Girl]]'' at [[Chichester Festival Theatre]] from 2 July to 25 August.

==Personal life==
Lucas is a patron of the Karen Morris Memorial Trust, a UK charity for [[leukaemia]] patients and their families. In April 2004, he appeared on ''Celebrity [[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]]'' and won £62,500 for the charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Karen Morris Memorial Trust|url=http://www.kmmt.org.uk/|accessdate=24 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
