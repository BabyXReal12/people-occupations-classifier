'''Joseph James Rogan''' (born August 11, 1967) is an American [[stand-up comedian]], martial arts [[color commentator]] and [[podcast]] host. A fan of comedy since his youth, Rogan began a career in stand-up in August 1988 in the [[Boston]] area, developing a [[blue comedy]] act. He moved to New York City two years later.

After relocating to Los Angeles in 1994, Rogan signed an exclusive developmental deal with [[Disney]], appeared as an actor on the television sitcoms ''[[Hardball (1994 TV series)|Hardball]]'' and ''[[NewsRadio]]'', and worked in local comedy clubs. In 1997, he started working for the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]] (UFC) as an interviewer and color commentator. Rogan released his first comedy special in 2000, and has since produced seven other specials. From 2001, he has been the host of several television shows, including ''[[Fear Factor]]'', ''[[The Man Show]]'', and ''[[Joe Rogan Questions Everything]]''.

In 2009, Rogan launched his podcast ''[[The Joe Rogan Experience]]'' which has become one of the most popular podcasts available; in October 2015, it was downloaded 16 million times. Rogan also is an advocate for the [[legalization of cannabis]], an avid [[hunting|hunter]] and part of the "Eat What You Kill" movement.

Rogan had no intention of being a professional stand-up comedian and initially considered a career in kickboxing.&lt;ref name=shecky/&gt;&lt;ref name=herald1999/&gt; He was a fan of comedy as a youngster and his parents took him to see comedian [[Richard Pryor]]'s film ''[[Richard Pryor: Live on the Sunset Strip (film)|Live on the Sunset Strip]]'', which affected him "in such a profound way. Nothing had made me laugh like that."&lt;ref name=schneider2002/&gt; Rogan's friends at his gym and taekwondo school convinced him to have a go at stand-up comedy as he would make jokes and do impressions to make them laugh.&lt;ref name=schneider2002/&gt; At 21, after six months preparing material and practising his delivery,&lt;ref name=comedycouch&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comedycouch.com/interviews/jrogan.htm|title=The Comedy Couch - Joe Rogan Interview|first=Guy|last=MacPherson|date=30 April 2007|publisher=The Comedy Couch|accessdate=5 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; he performed his first stand-up routine on August 27, 1988 at an open-mic night at Stitches comedy club in Boston.&lt;ref name=boston2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=shecky&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sheckymagazine.com/rogan.htm|title=The SHECKY!

At the show was talent manager Jeff Sussman, who liked Rogan's act and offered him to become his manager, to which Rogan accepted.&lt;ref name=schneider2002/&gt;&lt;ref name=herald2000/&gt; In 1990, Rogan moved to New York City as a full-time comedian; he was "scratching and grinding" for money at the time, so he stayed with his grandfather in Newark for the first six months.&lt;ref name="rogan2007"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://joerogan.net/blog/living-the-dream |title=Living the Dream |last=Rogan |first=Joe |date=30 November 2007 |publisher=JoeRogan.net |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140705111031/http://joerogan.net/blog/living-the-dream |archive-date=5 July 2014 |dead-url=yes |access-date=4 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rogan later cited [[Richard Jeni]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://vimeo.com/94257121 |title=JRE #496 – Nick Cutter on Vimeo |website=Vimeo.com |date=May 6, 2014 |accessdate=March 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lenny Bruce]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjeV2_hKLao |title=Joe Rogan Experience #463 – Louis Theroux |publisher=YouTube |date=January 6, 2012 |accessdate=March 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sam Kinison]] and [[Bill Hicks]] as comedy influences.&lt;ref name=shecky/&gt;

In 1994, Rogan relocated to [[Los Angeles]] as it presented more career opportunities.&lt;ref name=rollingstone2015/&gt; His first national television spot followed on the [[MTV]] comedy show ''Half-Hour Comedy Hour''.&lt;ref name=schneider2002/&gt; The appearance led to the network offering him a three-year exclusive contract and a role in a pilot episode of a "dopey game show" for $500. Rogan declined, but it prompted Sussman to send tapes of Rogan's performances to several networks which sparked a bidding war.&lt;ref name=shecky/&gt; After a period of negotiations, Rogan accepted a [[Artist development deal|development deal]] with the [[Disney]] network. He secured his first major acting role in the 1994 nine-episode [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] sitcom ''[[Hardball (1994 TV series)|Hardball]]'' as Frank Valente, a young, ego-centric star player on a professional baseball team.&lt;ref name=shecky/&gt; Rogan called the hiring process "weird" as the network had no idea if he could act until he was asked by Dean Valentine, then-president of [[Walt Disney Television]], to which he replied: "If you can lie, you can act, and if you can lie to crazy girlfriends, you can act under pressure".&lt;ref name=shecky/&gt; The filming schedule was a new experience for Rogan who started to work 12-hour days and among people.&lt;ref name=chicago1994/&gt; Rogan later said: "It was a great show on paper until a horrible executive producer with a big ego was hired by Fox to run the show and he re-wrote it."&lt;ref name=shecky/&gt; Around this time, Rogan began performing at [[The Comedy Store]] in Hollywood and became a paid regular by owner [[Mitzi Shore]]. He performed at the club for the next 13 years for free, and paid for the venue's new sound system.&lt;ref name=rogan20070323/&gt;

From 1995 to 1999, Rogan starred in the [[NBC]] sitcom ''[[NewsRadio]]'' as Joe Garrelli, an electrician and handyman at the show's fictional news radio station.&lt;ref name=schneider2002/&gt;&lt;ref name="tbs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tbs.com/stories/story/0,,88782,00.html |title=News Radio – Joe Rogan |accessdate=June 6, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111027171707/http://www.tbs.com/stories/story/0%2C%2C88782%2C00.html |archivedate=October 27, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The role was originally set to be played by actor [[Ray Romano]], but he was let go from the cast after one rehearsal and Rogan was brought in.&lt;ref name=shecky/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-18665739.html|title=Standup comedian Ray Romano waiting to see if everybody loves 'Raymond'|first=Steve|last=Hall|date=12 September 1996|newspaper=Indianapolis Star and News|accessdate=3 February 2016|via=Highbeam Research|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The switch caused Rogan to work with the show's writers to help develop the character in time before show was set to launch,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-25033900.html|title='Newsradio' The next big thing?|first=Phil|last=Rosenthal|date=5 March 1996|newspaper=Los Angeles Daily News|accessdate=3 February 2016|via=Highbeam Research|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; which he later described as a "very dumbed-down, censored version" of himself.&lt;ref name=herald2000/&gt; Rogan befriended fellow cast member [[Phil Hartman]] who confided his marital problems to him. Rogan claimed he tried to persuade Hartman to divorce his wife five times, but "he loved his kids and didn't want to leave".

=== 1997–2005: UFC, comedy specials, and television ===
[[File:JoeRogan-USMCPhoto-Cropped.PNG|thumb|right|upright|Rogan commentating for the UFC in 2006]]
Rogan began working for the [[mixed martial arts]] promotion [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]] as a backstage and post-fight interviewer; his first show took place at ''[[UFC 12|UFC 12: Judgement Day]]'' in [[Dothan, Alabama]] on February 7, 1997.&lt;ref name=cagepotato&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cagepotato.com/exclusive-interview-joe-rogan/|title=Exclusive Interview: Joe Rogan|date=30 January 2009|publisher=CagePotato|accessdate=5 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became interested in [[jiu-jitsu]] in 1994 after watching [[Royce Gracie]] fight at ''[[UFC 2|UFC 2: No Way Out]]'', and landed the position at the organization as Sussman was friends with its co-creator and original producer, [[Campbell McLaren]].&lt;ref name=bullz2007/&gt; He quit after around two years as his salary could not cover the cost of travelling to the events, which were in more rural locations at the time.&lt;ref name=si2012&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.si.com/mma/2012/04/21/joe-roganufc|title=Rogan the unlikely, but perfect voice for UFC broadcasts|date=21 April 2012|work=Sports Illustrated|accessdate=5 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the UFC was taken over by [[Zuffa]] in 2001, Rogan attended some events and became friends with its new president [[Dana White]], who offered him a job as a [[color commentator]] but Rogan initially declined as he "just wanted to go to the fights and drink".&lt;ref name=bullz2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=rollingstone2015/&gt; In 2002, White was able to hire Rogan for free in exchange for prime event tickets for him and his friends.&lt;ref name=cagepotato/&gt; After about fifteen free gigs as commentator Rogan accepted pay for the job, working alongside [[Mike Goldberg]] until the end of 2016.&lt;ref name=rollingstone2015/&gt; Rogan won the [[List of Wrestling Observer Newsletter awards|Wrestling Observer Newsletter Award]] for Best Television Announcer twice, and was named MMA Personality of the Year four times by the [[World MMA Awards]].&lt;ref name="MMAAwards"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineawards.co.uk/fightersonly/winners2011.asp | title=Fighters Only Awards 2010 |accessdate=February 22, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309033217/http://www.onlineawards.co.uk/fightersonly/Winners2011.asp |archivedate=March 9, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Rogan hosted the weekly UFC television show ''Inside the UFC''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-153168147.html|title='Grudge match' has to wait|date=22 October 2006|newspaper=The Boston Herald|accessdate=3 February 2016|via=Highbeam Research|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, development on Rogan's television show was interrupted after he accepted an offer from NBC to host the American edition of ''[[Fear Factor]]''. Rogan declined initially as he thought the network would not air such a program, but Sussman convinced him to accept.&lt;ref name=schneider2002/&gt; According to a 2015 interview with [[Art Bell]], Rogan expected ''Fear Factor'' would be cancelled after a few episodes due to objections with some of the content and further reported that he took the job mainly to obtain observations and anecdotes for his stand-up comedy career.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cDKRXkgTBg&lt;/ref&gt; The show increased Rogan's national exposure which caused turnouts at his stand-up gigs to grow. ''Fear Factor'' ran for six seasons from 2001 to 2006 and returned for a seventh and final season from 2011 to 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1N1-13B91B97441541F0.html|title='Fear Factor' still gross, now with more danger!|date=11 December 2011|newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times|first=Michael|last=Weaver|accessdate=3 February 2016|via=Highbeam Research|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, actor [[Wesley Snipes]] challenged Rogan to a cage fight.

In 2005, Rogan wrote a blog entry on his website accusing comedian [[Carlos Mencia]] of [[joke thievery]], a claim he had made since 1993,&lt;ref name=comedycouch/&gt; and dubbed him "Carlos Menstealia".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-27022136.html|title=Carlos Mencia|date=22 October 2006|newspaper=Arizona Daily Star|first= Cathalena E.|last=Burch|accessdate=3 February 2016|via=Highbeam Research|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dallas2010/&gt; The situation culminated in February 2007 when Rogan confronted Mencia on stage at [[The Comedy Store]] in Hollywood.&lt;ref name="Raustiala"&gt;Raustiala, Kal; Sprigman, Chris (March 30, 2010).

Rogan hosted the short lived CBS show ''[[Game Show in My Head]]'' that aired for eight episodes in January 2009 and produced by [[Ashton Kutcher]].&lt;ref name=cagepotato/&gt; The show involved contestants who try to convince people to perform or take part in increasingly bizarre situations for money.
