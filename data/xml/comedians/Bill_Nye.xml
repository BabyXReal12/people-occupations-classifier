He is best known as the host of the PBS children's science show ''[[Bill Nye the Science Guy]]'' (1993–1998), the Netflix show ''[[Bill Nye Saves the World]]'' (2017–present), and for his many subsequent appearances in popular media as a science educator.

Nye began his career as a mechanical engineer for [[Boeing|Boeing Corporation]] in [[Seattle]], where he invented a hydraulic resonance suppressor tube used on [[Boeing 747|747]] airplanes. In 1986, Nye left Boeing to pursue comedy, writing and performing jokes and bits for the local sketch television show ''[[Almost Live!]]'', where he would regularly conduct wacky science experiments. Nye aspired to become the next [[Don Herbert|Mr. Wizard]] and with the help of several producers successfully pitched the [[children's television program]] ''[[Bill Nye the Science Guy]]'' to [[KCTS-TV]], channel 9, Seattle's public television station. The show—which proudly proclaimed in its theme song that "science rules!"—ran from 1994 to 1999 in national TV syndication. Known for its "high-energy presentation and MTV-paced segments,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Goldberg |first=Carey |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/04/09/garden/pondering-fire-infinity-and-a-head-of-lettuce-cool.html |title=Pondering Fire, Infinity and a Head of Lettuce (Cool!) |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=1997-04-09 |accessdate=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; the program became a hit for both kids and adults. The show was critically acclaimed and was nominated for 23 [[Daytime Emmy Award|Emmy Awards]], winning nineteen.

Following the success of his show, Nye continued to advocate for science, becoming the [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of [[the Planetary Society]] and helping develop sundials for the [[Mars Exploration Rover]] missions.&lt;ref name="sundials"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilensky |first=Joe |url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/Aug11/NyeSolarClock.html |title=Cornell Chronicle: Bill Nye '77 dedicates Solar Noon Clock |publisher=News.cornell.edu |date=August 29, 2011 |accessdate=July 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nye has written two best-selling books on science, including ''[[Undeniable: Evolution and the Science of Creation]]'' in 2014 and ''[[Unstoppable: Harnessing Science to Change the World]]'' in 2015.

==Early career in Seattle==
===1977–1986: Job at Boeing===
After graduating from Cornell, Nye worked as an engineer for the [[Boeing|Boeing Corporation]] and Sundstrand Data Control near Seattle. While at Boeing, he invented a hydraulic resonance suppressor tube used on [[Boeing 747]] airplanes.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia-of-science"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Priest |first=Susanna Hornig |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Science and Technology Communication |title=Nye, Bill (1955–) |date=2010 |publisher=SAGE Publications |page=533 |url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=l1F2AwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=%22Encyclopedia+of+Science+and+Technology+Communication%22+priest&amp;ots=9x-CGu5BNO&amp;sig=H5d2kj9VrjT-U9P5cCr6Bta21qQ#v=snippet&amp;q=%22hydraulic%20resonance%20suppressor%20tube%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=2017-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nye applied four times for NASA's astronaut training program, but was always rejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Freeman |first=David |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bill-nye-never-became-an-astronaut_us_56742765e4b014efe0d521b3 |title=Maybe This Is Why Bill Nye Never Became An Astronaut |work=[[HuffPost]] |date=2015-12-18 |accessdate=2018-03-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nye started doing standup comedy after winning a [[Steve Martin]] look-alike contest in 1978.&lt;ref name="almost-live"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.seattlemet.com/articles/2013/5/17/an-oral-history-of-almost-live-june-2013 |title=An Oral History of ‘Almost Live’ |work=[[Seattle Metropolitan]] |date=2013-05-17 |accessdate=2017-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nye's friends began asking him to do Steve Martin impressions at parties and he discovered how much he loved to make people laugh. Nye began moonlighting as a comedian, while still holding his day job as a mechanical engineer at Boeing.&lt;ref name="Fast Company"&gt;{{cite news |last=Kessler |first=Sarah |url=https://www.fastcompany.com/3001653/how-bill-nye-became-science-guy-and-ballet-shoe-inventor-and-political-voice |title=How Bill Nye Became The Science Guy. And A Ballet Shoe Inventor. And a Political Voice |work=[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]] |date=2012-10-01 |accessdate=2017-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nye has stated of that time: "At this point in our story, I was working on business jet navigation systems, laser gyroscope systems during the day, and I'd take a nap and go do stand-up comedy by night".&lt;ref name="Fast Company" /&gt;

He also participated in [[Big Brothers Big Sisters of America]] and would volunteer at the [[Pacific Science Center]] on weekends, as a "Science Explainer".&lt;ref name="almost-live" /&gt;

===1986–1991: Comedy beginnings and ''Almost Live!''===
Nye quit his job at Boeing on October 3, 1986 to focus on his burgeoning comedy career.&lt;ref name="Fast Company"/&gt;

During Nye's 10 year college reunion in 1987, he went through great lengths to meet with Sagan at Cornell. His assistant told Nye, "Okay, you can talk to him for five minutes." While meeting him at the space sciences building, Nye explained that he was interested in developing a science television program. "I mentioned how I planned to talk about bridges and bicycles and so on—stuff that, as an engineer, I'd been interested in—and he said, 'Focus on pure science. Kids resonate to pure science rather than technology.' And that turned out to be great advice."&lt;ref name="nuttiest-professor"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.seattlemet.com/articles/2013/9/3/bill-nye-is-still-the-nuttiest-professor-september-2013 |title=Bill Nye Is Still the Nuttiest Professor |work=[[Seattle Metropolitan]] |date=2013-09-03 |accessdate=2017-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, Nye worked as a writer/actor on a local [[sketch comedy]] television show in Seattle, called ''[[Almost Live!]].'' Nye first got his big break on the show from [[John Keister (comedian)|John Keister]] who met him during an open mic night.&lt;ref name="bill-nye-is-back"/&gt; After a guest canceled, co-host [[Ross Shafer]] mentioned to Nye that he had seven minutes of programming to fill. "Why don’t you do that science stuff?" Shafer suggested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bradley |first=Ryan |url=https://www.popsci.com/article/science/bill-nye-fights-back |title=Bill Nye Fights Back |work=Popular Science |date=2014-08-21 |accessdate=2018-03-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the show, Nye entertained audiences with comical demonstrations like what happens when you eat a marshmallow that's been dunked in liquid nitrogen.&lt;ref name="Bill Nye Interview"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KkKejZnazw#t=106|title=Bill Nye the Science Guy Interview|accessdate=March 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His other main recurring role on ''Almost Live!'' was as Speed Walker, a [[Racewalking|speedwalking]] Seattle superhero "who fights crime while maintaining strict adherence to the regulations of the international speed-walking association."&lt;ref name="almost-live"/&gt;

One famous incident on the show led to his stage name. He corrected Keister on his pronunciation of the word "[[gigawatt]]", and the nickname was born when Keister responded, "Who do you think you are—Bill Nye the Science Guy?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://splitsider.com/2011/09/almost-live-what-seattle-sketch-comedy-gave-to-us/ |title=Almost Live!: What Seattle Sketch Comedy Gave to Us |work=[[Splitsider]] |date=2011-09-27 |accessdate=2017-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nye's science experiments strongly resonated with viewers and the local chapter of the [[National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences]] awarded Nye a talent Emmy for one of his segments.&lt;ref name="Seattle-TV"&gt;{{cite news |last=Boss |first=Kit |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1989/10/04/on-seattle-tv-its-a-comic-its-an-engineer_its-science-guy/a827725e-e030-4330-80a1-23939c20fc6f/ |title=ON SEATTLE TV, IT'S A COMIC, IT'S AN ENGINEER_IT'S SCIENCE GUY! |work=[[Washington Post]] |date=1989-10-04 |accessdate=2018-03-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though Nye had become a regular on ''Almost Live!'', he was only doing [[freelancer|freelance work]] for the program.&lt;ref name="bill-nye-early-life"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://depts.washington.edu/sthp/exhibits/show/billnye/billnyesearlylifeandcareer |title=BILL NYE'S EARLY LIFE AND CAREER 1955-1992 |work=Seattle Television History |publisher=[[University of Washington]] |accessdate=2017-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; While looking for more TV gigs, Nye was given the opportunity in 1989 to host a short educational program on Washington State's wetlands called ''Fabulous Wetlands,'' sponsored by the [[Washington State Department of Ecology]].&lt;ref name="bill-nye-early-life"/&gt; On ''Fabulous Wetlands,'' Nye explained the importance of preserving estuaries and the hazards of pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Bill Nye |date=1989 |title=Fabulous Wetlands with Bill Nye The Science Guy (1989) |trans-title= |medium= |language= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeUPbGWg2KU |accessdate=2017-05-08 |time= |location= |publisher=[[Washington State Department of Ecology]] |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote=YouTube title:Fabulous Wetlands with Bill Nye The Science Guy (1989)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show became, in many ways, a model for Nye's later show, with "zany camera cuts paired with Nye's humor" that set it apart from the typical scientific broadcast.&lt;ref name="bill-nye-early-life"/&gt; Nye soon began getting more offers to make appearances on nationally broadcast programs, including taping eight segments for the [[Disney Channel]]'s ''[[The Mickey Mouse Club|All-New Mickey Mouse Club]].''&lt;ref name="Seattle-TV"/&gt;

Following his stint on ''Almost Live!'', from 1991 to 1993, he appeared on live-action educational segments of ''[[Back to the Future: The Animated Series]]'', assisting Dr. [[Emmett Brown]] (played by [[Christopher Lloyd]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/netflix-orders-bill-nye-talk-924641 |title=Netflix Orders Bill Nye Talk Show |work=Hollywood Reporter |date=2016-08-31 |accessdate=2018-03-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, he developed a ''[[Bill Nye the Science Guy]]'' pilot for [[public broadcasting]] station [[KCTS-TV]] in [[Seattle]]. Nye collaborated with James McKenna, Erren Gottlieb and Elizabeth Brock to plan and create the show for KCTS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://depts.washington.edu/sthp/exhibits/show/kctsbillnye/kctsbillnyee |title=HISTORICAL BACKGROUND FOR KCTS |work=Seattle Television History |publisher=University of Washington |accessdate=2017-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group pitched the show as ''[[Mr. Wizard]]'' meets ''[[Pee-wee's Playhouse]]''.&lt;ref name="nuttiest-professor"/&gt; He successfully obtained underwriting from the [[National Science Foundation]] and the [[US Department of Energy]]. Nye's program became part of a package of syndicated series that local stations could schedule to fulfill [[Children's Television Act]] requirements.&lt;ref name="bill-nye-tv"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Chotkowski LaFollette |first1=Marcel |title=Science on American Television: A History |publisher=University of Chicago Press |date=2012 &lt;!--|accessdate=2017-04-23--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, ''Bill Nye the Science Guy'' became the first program to run concurrently on public and commercial stations.&lt;ref name="bill-nye-tv"/&gt;

''Bill Nye the Science Guy'' ran from 1993 to 1998, becoming one of the most-watched educational TV shows in the United States.&lt;ref name="bill-nye-effect"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19941218&amp;slug=1948193|title=The Bill Nye Effect|first=Kit|last=Boss |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |date=December 18, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; While portraying "The Science Guy", Nye wore a powder blue [[lab coat]] and a [[bow tie]]. Nye Labs, the production offices and set where the show was shot, was located in a converted clothing warehouse near Seattle's [[Kingdome]].&lt;ref name="bill-nye-effect"/&gt; Each episode of the program strived to educate younger viewers on various science concepts, yet it also attracted a significant adult audience as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Study of Bill Nye The Science Guy:Outreach and Image |url=http://www.rockman.com/projects/124.kcts.billnye/nye_exec_98.pdf |page=10 |accessdate=November 23, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222043847/http://www.rockman.com/projects/124.kcts.billnye/nye_exec_98.pdf |archivedate=February 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show's ability to make science entertaining and accessible made it a popular teaching tool in classrooms across the country. With its quirky humor and rapid-fire MTV-style pacing, the show won critical acclaim and was nominated for 23 [[Daytime Emmy Award|Emmy Awards]], winning nineteen. Subsequent research studies found the program to be effective in teaching students science: those that viewed ''Bill Nye'' regularly were better able to generate explanations and extensions of scientific ideas than non-viewers.&lt;ref name="study"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bell |first1=Phillip |url=https://www.nap.edu/catalog/12190/learning-science-in-informal-environments-people-places-and-pursuits |title=Learning Science in Informal Environments: People, Places, and Pursuits |publisher=National Academies Press |date=2009 |page=253 |accessdate=May 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the TV show, Nye published several books as The Science Guy. A [[CD-ROM]] based on the series, titled ''Bill Nye the Science Guy: Stop the Rock!'', was released in 1996 for [[Windows]] and [[Macintosh]] by Pacific Interactive.

Nye's Science Guy personality is also prominent at [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts]], most notably his appearance with [[Ellen DeGeneres]] at ''[[Ellen's Energy Adventure]]'', an attraction which ran from 1996 to 2017 at the [[Universe of Energy]] pavilion located inside [[Epcot]] at [[Walt Disney World]]. His Science Guy persona was also the on-air spokesman for the [[Nick Jr.|Noggin]] television network during 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-56067350.html|title=Noggin nabs Nye|work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]]|accessdate=April 22, 2016}} {{subscription required|via=HighBeam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|The Eyes of Nye}}
Following the success of ''Bill Nye the Science Guy,'' Nye began work on a comeback project, entitled ''[[The Eyes of Nye]]'', aimed at an older audience and tackling more controversial science subject matter such as [[genetically modified food]], [[global warming]], and race. However "shifting creative concepts, infighting among executives and disputes over money with Seattle producing station KCTS," significantly delayed production for years.&lt;ref name="hope-and-dismay"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://current.org/wp-content/uploads/archive-site/ptv/ptv0309kctsnye.html |title=Bill Nye comeback: hope and dismay in Seattle |work=Current.org |date=2003-05-13 |accessdate=2017-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; KCTS was hampered by budgetary problems and wasn't able to produce an ''Eyes of Nye'' pilot on time.&lt;ref name="hope-and-dismay"/&gt; "KCTS went through some distress," Nye recalled. "When we did ''The Eyes of Nye,'' the budget started out really big, and by the time we served all these little problems at KCTS, we had a much lower budget for the show than we’d ever had for the ‘Science Guy’ show which was made several years earlier."&lt;ref name="bill-nye-is-back"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/tv/bill-nye-is-back-and-trying-to-save-the-world-in-new-netflix-series/ |title=Bill Nye is back and trying to save the world in new Netflix series |work=Seattle Times |date=2017-04-19 |accessdate=2017-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; PBS declined to distribute ''Eyes of Nye,'' though the show was eventually picked up by [[American Public Television]]. "PBS wanted more serious, in-depth ''[[Nova (TV series)|Nova]]''-style shows," explained co-producer Randy Brinson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/ae/tv/article/That-Science-Guy-is-back-in-Eyes-of-Nye-1170110.php |format=PDF |title=That Science Guy is back, in 'Eyes of Nye' |work=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]] |date=2005-04-04 |archiveurl=http://depts.washington.edu/sthp/files/original/7f5fa541273d7decf6590c18cea18d39.pdf |archivedate=May 23, 2016 |deadurl=no |accessdate=May 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show, which eventually premiered in 2005, lasted for only one season and Nye acknowledged ditching his bow-tie on the program was a mistake. "I tried wearing a straight tie. It was nothing," Nye said. "We were trying something new. It wasn’t me."&lt;ref name="bill-nye-is-back"/&gt;

In an interview with [[Marc Morano]], Nye was asked about the prospect of jailing or punishing climate change deniers. He indicated he was open to the idea, saying, "We'll see what happens".

Nye's attendance drew scrutiny due to Bridestine's "history of expressing climate change skepticism," but Nye defended the move. "While the Congressman and I disagree on a great many issues -- we share a deep respect for NASA and its achievements and a strong interest in the future of space exploration. My attendance tomorrow should not be interpreted as an endorsement of this administration, or of Congressman Bridenstine's nomination, or seen as an acceptance of the recent attacks on science and the scientific community," Nye said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/01/30/politics/bill-nye-jim-bridenstine-state-of-the-union/index.html |title=Bill Nye defends plan to see State of the Union with Trump's NASA nominee |work=CNN |date=2018-01-30 |accessdate=2018-03-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tindall acknowledged killing his plants but denied being a threat to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tmz.com/2007/11/19/the-science-guy-wants-to-send-wife-to-the-moon/|title="The Science Guy" Wants to Send "Wife" to the Moon|work=[[TMZ.com]]|accessdate=March 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, Nye sued Tindall for $57,000 in attorney's fees after she allegedly violated the protective order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tmz.com/2012/02/27/bill-nye-girlfriend-stalker-blair-tindall/|title=Bill Nye the Science Guy -- Locked in $57,000 Battle with Stalker Ex-Girlfriend|work=TMZ.com|accessdate=March 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2017 [[PBS]] documentary "[[Bill Nye: Science Guy]]", Nye revealed his family's plight of [[ataxia]]. Due to his father, sister and brother's lifelong struggles with balance and coordination, Nye decided to not have children himself - as to not pass the gene to them (even though he "dodged the genetic bullet" himself). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/03/bill-nye-documentary-science-guy-just-wants-to-influence-and-maybe-save-the-world/|title=Documentary reveals how a troubled Bill Nye tries to save the world|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2018, Nye played for the [[National League]] squad during the [[Taco Bell All-Star Legends and Celebrity Softball Game| MLB All-Star Legends and Celebrity Softball Game]]. Despite striking out in his first at-bat, Nye singled in the bottom of the third inning to a rousing ovation from the [[Nationals Park]] crowd.
