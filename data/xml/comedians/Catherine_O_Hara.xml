==Early life==
O'Hara was born in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], into a large family of [[Irish people|Irish]] descent.&lt;ref&gt;Onstad, Katrina (April 12, 2005){{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/walkoffame/ohara.html | title=Inductee: Mary Margaret O'Hara| publisher=CBC News| accessdate=October 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was raised [[Catholic]] and is the sixth of seven children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2013/11/proust-questionnaire-catherine-o-hara |title=Proust Questionnaire: Catherine O’Hara |work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |accessdate=November 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She attended [[Burnhamthorpe Collegiate Institute]], where she first met fellow comedian [[Robin Duke]].{{Cn|date=September 2017}}

==Career==
O'Hara started her comedy career in 1974 as a cast member of [[The Second City]] in her native Toronto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.secondcity.com/?id=history/alumni/toronto|title=The Second City|publisher=secondcity.com|accessdate=October 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was an understudy for [[Gilda Radner]] until Radner left for ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.&lt;ref name="People1986"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lidz|first1=Franz|title=Once the Comedy Queen of SCTV, Reclusive Catherine O'Hara Swears She Isn't Just Lying Down on the Job|url=https://people.com/archive/once-the-comedy-queen-of-sctv-reclusive-catherine-ohara-swears-she-isnt-just-lying-down-on-the-job-vol-26-no-15/|accessdate=27 May 2018|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]|date=October 13, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kavner|first1=Lucas|title=Catherine O’Hara and Eugene Levy on Their Onscreen Romances and More Than 40 Years of Comedy Together|url=http://www.vulture.com/2015/02/schitts-creek-catherine-ohara-eugene-levy.html|accessdate=27 May 2018|work=Vulture|date=February 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, this theater troupe created the sketch comedy show ''[[Second City Television|SCTV]]'', for which O'Hara became a regular performer.&lt;ref name="People1986"/&gt; Her memorable characterizations on the show included Las Vegas scorcher Lola Heatherton, buzzer-happy game show contestant Margaret Meehan, raunchy nightclub comedian Dusty Towne, soap opera seductress Sue Ellen, and stage actress Sue Bopper Simpson.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

In the late 1970s, she provided voice-overs for a number of [[cartoon]]s, work which would continue throughout her career. During a short time in the early 1980s when ''SCTV'' was in between network deals, she was hired to replace [[Ann Risley]] when ''Saturday Night Live'' was being retooled in 1981. However, she quit the show without ever appearing on air, choosing to go back to ''SCTV'' when the show signed on with [[NBC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/article/220072|title=Catherine The Great|publisher=thestar.com|accessdate=October 14, 2011|location=Toronto|date=June 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://rickmoranisfanpage.com/Articles/secondcityshoots.html| title=SCTV Shoots For First| publisher=rickmoranisfanpage.com| accessdate=October 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her ''SNL'' position was then given to fellow Canadian [[Robin Duke]], who had also replaced O'Hara for a season on ''SCTV''.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} O'Hara also starred in ''The Nightmare Before Christmas''.

O'Hara began her career on television, apart from ''SCTV'', in the mid-1970s. She appeared in the 1976 television film ''The Rimshots'', the children's television series ''[[Coming Up Rosie]]'' for a year, and television specials, such as ''[[Witch's Night Out]]'' and ''[[Intergalactic Thanksgiving]]''. But it was her performances on ''SCTV'' that earned her fame in Canada, which is why she returned to the show, not only as an actress but as a writer for both ''SCTV'' and ''[[SCTV Network 90]]'', which earned her an [[Emmy Award]] for outstanding writing and two Emmy Award nominations. She also has written for ''SCTV Channel''.

O'Hara has appeared in a number of television series and television films and continues to work in television. During the '90s, she made guest appearances on ''[[Tales from the Crypt (TV series)|Tales from the Crypt]]'', ''[[Oh Baby (TV series)|Oh Baby]]'', ''[[Morton &amp; Hayes]]'' and ''[[The Larry Sanders Show]]''. She served as actress and director on ''[[Dream On (TV series)|Dream On]]'' and ''[[The Outer Limits (1995 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]'', the revival of the '60s series of [[The Outer Limits (1963 TV series)|the same name]]. O'Hara has guest-starred on top-rated television series including ''[[Six Feet Under (TV series)|Six Feet Under]]'' and ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]''. In May 2008, it was announced that she had signed on to star in the upcoming [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[dramedy]] ''Good Behavior''.&lt;ref&gt;Waldman, Allison (May 2, 2008) {{cite web| url=http://www.tvsquad.com/2008/05/02/oh-good-catherine-ohara-to-star-in-abc-pilot| title=Oh, good!

O'Hara has also had a successful career in film. She made her feature debut in the 1980 film ''[[Deadly Companion|Double Negative]]'', which also starred her ''SCTV'' co-stars [[John Candy]], [[Eugene Levy]], and [[Joe Flaherty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Catherine O'Hara|url=https://www.secondcity.com/people/other/catherine-ohara/|publisher=[[The Second City]]|accessdate=27 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, O'Hara appeared in many supporting roles, including [[Martin Scorsese]]'s ''[[After Hours (film)|After Hours]]'' and ''[[Heartburn (film)|Heartburn]]'', with [[Meryl Streep]]. She had more notable roles in ''[[Beetlejuice]]'', the blockbuster hit ''[[Home Alone (film)|Home Alone]]'' and its sequel ''[[Home Alone 2: Lost in New York]]''. In 1992, O'Hara worked alongside [[Jeff Daniels]] in the comedy ''[[There Goes the Neighborhood (film)|There Goes the Neighborhood]]''.  O'Hara continued to appear in many films during the 1990s and the beginning of the 21st century. She received roles in four of [[Christopher Guest]]'s [[mockumentary]] films, three of which earned her awards and nominations: ''[[Waiting for Guffman]]'', ''[[Best in Show (film)|Best in Show]]'', ''[[A Mighty Wind]]'' and ''[[For Your Consideration (film)|For Your Consideration]]''. Her role in 1999's ''[[The Life Before This]]'' won her a [[Genie Award for Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role]]. She also appeared in episodes 6, 10 and 11 on the tenth and final series of the UK ''[[Whose Line Is It Anyway?]]'' In 2006, she starred with [[Christina Ricci]] in the fantasy feature ''[[Penelope (2006 film)|Penelope]]''.
