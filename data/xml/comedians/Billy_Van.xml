'''William Allan Van Evera''' (11 August 1934 &amp;ndash; 8 January 2003), known by the stage name '''Billy Van''', was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] comedian, actor, and singer.

==Biography==
Van was born in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], and dropped out of [[Bloor Collegiate Institute]] in Grade 11 to pursue a career as an entertainer. Starting as a youth, he and his four brothers toured [[North America]] as a singing act called the Van Evera Brothers. After leaving his brothers and dropping "Evera" from his name, Van performed as a singer, leading the Billy Van Four and later the Billy Van Singers, and making frequent appearances on Canadian variety television shows such as ''Fancy Free''.&lt;ref name=fancyfree&gt;{{cite web| title = Billy Van Four To Be Regulars On Fancy Free| url=http://www.tvarchive.ca/database/18691/swing_easy/articles/| accessdate = 10 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The single "I Miss You" / "The Last Sunrise" by the Billy Van Four, released on the Rodeo International label, peaked at number 29 on the [[CHUM Chart]] in Toronto in March 1961.&lt;ref&gt;Ron Hall, ''The Chum Chart Book: 1957-1983'', 1984, p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a comedian, Van gained national attention in 1963 as a performer on [[CBC Television]]'s late-night satire programme ''Nightcap''. He threatened to quit the show after three seasons when the CBC wouldn't give him a requested raise from $400 to $500 an episode. At that time, a columnist in ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' called Van "perhaps the most talented variety performer ever developed by the CBC."&lt;ref&gt;"Thanks for nothing," Dennis Braithwaite, ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', 6 September 1966, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; After the dispute became public, the CBC capitulated and Van continued on the show for one final season. Van appeared in a six-part spinoff series, ''Flemingdon Park'', based on a recurring ''Nightcap'' skit, that aired at the beginning of 1967. ''Nightcap'' was cancelled in May 1967.

Through the 1970s, Van was a regular member of the "home team" on the [[CHCH-TV]] [[charades]] series ''[[Party Game (game show)|Party Game]]''. In 1971, he began making ''[[The Hilarious House of Frightenstein]]'', also for CHCH in [[Hamilton, Ontario]]. It is this show for which he is best known, and it has developed a cult following. 130 episodes were produced, and Van played almost every lead character.&lt;ref name=chtv&gt;{{cite web| title = CH TV Hamilton History| url = http://www.canada.com/chtv/hamilton/info/history.html| accessdate = 29 January 2007| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060129104620/http://www.canada.com/chtv/hamilton/info/history.html| archivedate = 29 January 2006| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The characters included the Count (Count Frightenstein, for which he put on a fake [[Bela Lugosi]]-type voice); Grizelda the Ghastly Gourmet (an old witch with a cauldron who did a cooking show); the Wolfman, who, in an imitation of DJ [[Wolfman Jack]] would play records, and dance to them, while wearing a werewolf costume (rock songs from [[Sly and the Family Stone]], the Archies, or other bands of the era were played in their entirety); the Librarian, an ancient bearded character who tried "to horrify you" with benign fairy tales from dusty old cobwebbed volumes, then would be disappointed when the unseen viewers were not horrified; Dr. Petvet, who would bring animals onto a set and talk about them (his catchphrase was "Pets are friends"); and the Oracle, who would give astrological readings, and answer fake letters from viewers while wearing a large headdress and speaking in a fake [[Peter Lorre]] voice.

Van was a regular performer on ''The [[Ray Stevens]] Show'', ''The [[Ken Berry]] "Wow" Show'', ''[[The Sonny &amp; Cher Comedy Hour]]'', ''[[The Bobby Vinton Show]]'', and the ''[[Hudson Brothers]] Razzle Dazzle Show'', most of which were co-produced by [[Chris Bearde]], who had been a writer-performer on ''Nightcap''. Van also appeared in many commercials, including [[Colt 45 (malt liquor)|Colt 45 Malt Liquor]] commercials for 15 years, where he won a Clio Award in 1975.&lt;ref name=clio&gt;{{cite web| title = Clio Awards| url=http://www.clioawards.com/archive/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, he hosted [[TVOntario]]'s ''[[Bits and Bytes]]'', a show devoted to the usage of early (mostly 8-bit) personal computers, a role returned to 1991 in ''Bits in Bytes 2''. Van narrated the animated program ''[[Eureka! (TV series)|Eureka!]]'', which taught children about physics and chemistry. Van also appeared occasionally in the Canadian TV show ''[[Bizarre (TV series)|Bizarre]]'', hosted by [[John Byner]].

He had a triple heart bypass in 1998.&lt;ref name=TS09Jan2003&gt;{{cite news | title=Billy Van was able to see funny side of Canadian TV ; Versatile comic dies at 68 after battle with cancer Returned home after '70s success on U.S. television | first=Chris | last=Sorenson | publisher=[[Toronto Star]] | date=9 January 2003 | page=A17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Van supported the [[Canadian Comedy Awards]] with promotional appearances from the awards' inception in 2000.&lt;ref name=SS9Jan2003 /&gt;

He was diagnosed in December 2001 with [[esophageal cancer]], of which he died at age 68 on 8 January 2003 at Toronto's [[Sunnybrook and Women's College Health Science Centre|Sunnybrook Hospital]].&lt;ref name=TS09Jan2003 /&gt;&lt;ref name=CBC23Mar2005&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/walkoffame/billyvan.html | publisher=[[CBC News]] | title=Inductee: Billy Van | first=Andrew | last=Clark | date=23 March 2005 | accessdate=8 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was survived by his wife Susan and two daughters, Tracy and Robyn, from a previous marriage.&lt;ref name=SS9Jan2003&gt;{{cite news | title=Veteran comic Billy Van dies of cancer at age 68 | publisher=[[Sudbury Star]] | date=9 January 2003 | page=A8 | author=[[The Canadian Press]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Van's brothers, [[Jack Van Evera]], also became an actor and appeared on many Canadian television series such as ''[[The Forest Rangers]]'' and ''[[Adventures in Rainbow Country]]''.
