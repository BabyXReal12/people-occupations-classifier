'''Amy Louise Sedaris''' ({{IPAc-en|s|ɪ|ˈ|d|ɛər|ɪ|s}};&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=wcK1sLplMA0|title="Amy Sedaris – I Like You"}}, retrieved 2012-02-28. She pronounces her name at the very beginning.&lt;/ref&gt; born March 29, 1961) is an American actress, comedian and writer known for playing [[Jerri Blank]] in the [[Comedy Central]] television series ''[[Strangers with Candy]]''. She regularly collaborates with her older brother [[David Sedaris|David]], a humorist and author. Since 2014, Sedaris has voiced the character Princess Carolyn in the [[Netflix]] animated series ''[[BoJack Horseman]]''.

==Early life==
Sedaris was born in [[Endicott, New York]], the daughter of Sharon Elizabeth (née Leonard) and Louis Harry "Lou" Sedaris,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Heard|first=Alex|title=This American Lie: A midget guitar teacher, a Macy's elf, and the truth about David Sedaris.|url=http://www.tnr.com/article/american-lie-midget-guitar-teacher-macys-elf-and-thetruth-about-david-sedaris|publisher=The New Republic|accessdate=19 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and grew up in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]], with her siblings, Lisa, [[David Sedaris|David]], Gretchen, Tiffany, and Paul. Her father is of [[Greek American|Greek]] descent and her mother was an [[English American|Anglo-American]].&lt;ref&gt;Stated on ''[[Finding Your Roots]]'', PBS, November 18, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Her father is [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]], and her mother was a [[Protestantism|Protestant]]. She was raised in her father's Orthodox faith.&lt;ref name="amazon"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.amazon.com/Me-Talk-Pretty-One-Day/dp/0316776963|title= Me Talk Pretty One Day|website=Amazon.com| publisher=Amazon.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="amysedarisrocks"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.amysedarisrocks.com/transletapr05.htm|title= Amy Sedaris Interview }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At age 16, Sedaris worked at her local [[Winn-Dixie]] supermarket. She would make fake announcements over the loudspeaker, prompting the head cashier to confiscate the microphone and threaten to fire her. After work, she egged the cashier's car in protest. Later, as a [[cocktail waitress]] at [[Zanies Comedy Club]] in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], she was fired for being five minutes late. She took her revenge on her boss: "I took his keys, and I threw them in the snow. I heard he found them in the spring."&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=kIkP89QF7_A|title=Amy Sedaris – The Best and the Brightest *Interview (June 21/11)}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to David Sedaris' book ''[[Me Talk Pretty One Day]]'', Amy was a very dramatic child and would often assume characters to play pranks on her family.

==Career==

===Television===
A former member of [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]]-based [[The Second City|Second City]] and [[Annoyance Theatre]] comedy troupes, Sedaris' first major foray into television began in 1995 on the [[Comedy Central]] sketch show, ''[[Exit 57]]'', which also starred [[Stephen Colbert]] and [[Paul Dinello]].&lt;ref name="exit57"&gt;{{IMDb title|0166039|Exit 57}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show ran for one season.&lt;ref name="exit57" /&gt;

Beginning in 1999, Sedaris portrayed Jerri Blank in the Comedy Central series ''[[Strangers with Candy]]''.&lt;ref name="swc"&gt;{{IMDb title|0194624|Strangers with Candy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show, which she co-wrote with Dinello and Colbert, was based on Sedaris's impression of 1970s-era [[Motivational speaking|motivational speaker]] [[Florrie Fisher]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0194624/trivia|title=Strangers with Candy|date=7 April 1999|publisher=|via=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show ran for three seasons and would later inspire a [[Strangers with Candy (film)|full-length movie]].&lt;ref name="amyimdb" /&gt;

Sedaris has made numerous guest appearances on a number of different TV programs, including ''[[Rescue Me (U.S. TV series)|Rescue Me]]'', ''[[Monk (TV series)|Monk]]'', ''[[Wonder Showzen]]'', ''[[Just Shoot Me!]]'', ''[[Sex and the City]]'', ''[[My Name Is Earl]]'', ''[[The Closer]]'', ''[[The Middle (TV series)|The Middle]]'', ''[[The New Adventures of Old Christine]]'', ''[[Raising Hope]]'', and ''[[Sesame Street]]''.&lt;ref name="amyimdb"&gt;{{IMDb name|781238|Amy Sedaris}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sedaris also hosted the series ''Film Fanatic'' on [[Trio channel|Trio]].{{when|date=December 2014}}&lt;ref name="amyimdb" /&gt;

[[File:Amy sedaris2 2006.jpg|thumb|Sedaris making brownies at the 2006 [[Texas Book Festival]].]]

In 2007, Sedaris was featured in [[Dolly Parton]]'s first mainstream [[country music]] video in 14 years, "[[Better Get to Livin']]{{-"}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=BuzzSugar |url=http://www.buzzsugar.com/843202 |title=Music Video: Dolly Parton, "Better Get to Livin'" (With Amy Sedaris!) |publisher=Buzzsugar.com |date=2007-11-28 |accessdate=2011-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was announced in October 2008 that Sedaris would be getting her own sitcom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Amy Sedaris Inks Sitcom Deal, Guest Gig on The Closer|work=[[TV Guide]]|date=October 15, 2008|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Amy-Sedaris-sitcom-26544.aspx

Also in late 2008, Sedaris did [[voiceover]]s in several commercials for the discount hair salon [[SuperCuts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Zachary Paul Sire |url=http://siresays.blogspot.com/2008/09/as-if-today-couldnt-get-any-more-weird.html |title=Sire Says 2.0: As If Today Couldn't Get Any More Weird |publisher=Siresays.blogspot.com |date=2008-01-09 |accessdate=2011-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=RXHoJ3eku2c |title=SuperCuts Commercial}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2009, Sedaris narrated the [[PBS]] special ''Make 'Em Laugh: The Funny Business of America'', a six-hour documentary on comedians and comedy in American history.&lt;ref name=pbs&gt;{{cite web|title=About: Make 'Em Laugh|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/makeemlaugh/about/|website=PBS|publisher=PBS|accessdate=6 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2010, she appeared as a supporting character in the Canadian comedy series ''[[The Drunk and On Drugs Happy Fun Time Hour]]''.&lt;ref name=globe&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/arts/the-boys-are-back-this-time-on-drugs/article1637258/ "The Boys are back and on drugs"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100915000709/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/arts/the-boys-are-back-this-time-on-drugs/article1637258/ |date=2010-09-15 }}, ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', July 12, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

From September 2010 to February 2011, she also voiced the ''[[WordGirl]]'' character Miss Davis, the Woodview School's debate club teacher in the season 2 episode "Cleanup on Aisle Eleven" and where she was the schoolteacher of Becky, Todd, Violet, Tobey and Victoria in "Cherish is the Word" in season 3.

In December 2010, Sedaris appeared with [[Paul Dinello]] in the "Mummified Hand" episode of the Discovery/Science Channel show ''[[Oddities (TV series)|Oddities]]''.

In 2011, she appeared in a series of commercials for [[Downy]] ([[Lenor]] UK) Unstoppables, a [[fabric softener]] product. The ad was designed by [[Grey Global Group|Grey]] with the aim of "kicking the old 'mom' image with spots featuring 'laundry expert' (and accomplished lifestyle guru) Amy Sedaris".&lt;ref name=adweek&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bazilian|first1=Emma|title=Amy Sedaris and Her Unstopables Will Get Your Clothes Kooky Clean|url=http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/ad-day-downy-134220|work=[[AdWeek]]|date=18 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, she replaced [[Kristen Schaal]] as the sex-crazed sister Hurshe Heartshe, in the [[Adult Swim]] surreal nightmarish comedy series ''[[The Heart, She Holler]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.esquire.com/entertainment/interviews/a31410/amy-sedaris-interview-the-heart-she-holler-gift/|title=Amy Sedaris Talks 'The Heart, She Holler,' Jerry Blank, and Balls|date=2014-12-02|work=Esquire|access-date=2017-10-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Sedaris appeared in eight episodes of Amazon's ''[[Alpha House]]'', a political comedy series written by ''[[Doonesbury]]'' creator [[Garry Trudeau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Goodman|first=Tim|title= Alpha House: TV Review|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/alpha-house-tv-review-656034|accessdate=24 July 2014|newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter|date=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sedaris played Louise Laffer, the Mormon wife of Utah Senator Louis Laffer, who lives with three other Republican senators in a town house on Capitol Hill.

Since 2014, she has provided the voice for Princess Carolyn on the Netflix original show ''[[BoJack Horseman]]'', a role which some critics consider to be her best work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/bojack-horseman-burns-down-kitchen-and-its-oldest--240431|title=BoJack Horseman burns down a kitchen and its oldest relationship|publisher=A.V.

In October, 2017, Sedaris began ''[[At Home with Amy Sedaris]]'', an American television series appearing on [[truTV]], showcasing her playing various characters.

She has written a guide to entertaining titled ''I Like You: Hospitality Under the Influence'', published in October 2006 by Warner Books.

Her book, ''Simple Times: Crafts for Poor People!'' (2010), included a cover that can be easily made into a hat, as David Letterman demonstrated during her appearance on his ''Late Show'' in October 2010.

Along with her brother [[David Sedaris]], Amy has co-authored several plays under the name "The Talent Family": ''Stump the Host'' (1993), ''Stitches'' (1994), ''One Woman Shoe'' (1995), ''Incident at Cobblers Knob'' (1997) and ''The Little Frieda Mysteries''. She also co-authored the play ''The Book of Liz'' with him, which has gone on to productions at such regional theaters as [[No Name Players]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hoover |first=Ted |url=http://www.pittsburghcitypaper.ws/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A96587 |title=The Book of Liz &amp;#124; Theater Reviews + Features &amp;#124; Pittsburgh City Paper |publisher=Pittsburghcitypaper.ws |date= |accessdate=2013-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her theater work includes a role as the stage manager in [[Paul Rudnick]]'s play ''The Most Fabulous Story Ever Told''. In support of [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|PETA]]'s anti-fur campaign, Sedaris appeared as her ''Strangers with Candy'' character in an ad that reads, "When you wear fur, people laugh ''at'' you, not ''with'' you."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.latimes.com/features/image/la-ig-peta-0402amysedaris.jpg,0,5736484.photo Amy Sedaris]," ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', accessed 6 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to acting and writing, she ran a [[cupcake]] and [[cheese spread|cheese ball]] business, Dusty Food Cupcakes, out of her home kitchen,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvguide.com/news/Amy-Sedaris-Sells-40185.aspx "Amy Sedaris Sells Movie ''Candy''"], ''TV Guide'', Retrieved 2011-06-26.&lt;/ref&gt; but has since ceased doing so.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theawl.com/2013/09/and-what-did-you-do-on-your-summer-vacation-amy-sedaris "And How Was Your Summer, Amy Sedaris?"], [[The Awl]], Retrieved 2014-01-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

She was the emcee for [[Microsoft]]'s 2010 annual employee meeting in [[Seattle, Washington]] on September 28, 2010.&lt;ref name=microsoft&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fried|first1=Ina|title=A View From Inside Microsoft's Company Meeting|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/a-view-from-inside-microsofts-company-meeting/|work=CNET|date=28 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amy has also performed in seasons one and two of the podcast [[Gimlet Media#Homecoming|Homecoming]] as Audrey Temple.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://feeds.gimletmedia.com/homecomingshow&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Sedaris and her ''Strangers with Candy'' co-star [[Paul Dinello]] dated and lived together for eight years. Though their relationship ended, they have remained very close friends, and Dinello made Sedaris godmother to his son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pauldinello.net/bio.htm |title=Biography |publisher=Paul Dinello dot net |date= |accessdate=2011-05-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720234919/http://www.pauldinello.net/bio.htm |archivedate=2011-07-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/story?oid=oid%3A388486 |title=Blank Generation – Screens |work= [[The Austin Chronicle]] |date=2006-07-21 |accessdate=2011-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=8qQNWKhYorE|title=David Letterman – Amy Sedaris: Funny Godmother}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sedaris has stated in several interviews that she has never wanted to get married or have children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7NvkQ-e7Pw |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160528184247/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7NvkQ-e7Pw |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2016-05-28 |title=YouTube |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2013-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
