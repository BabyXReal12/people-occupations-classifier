'''James Thurston Nabors''' (June 12, 1930 – November 30, 2017) was an American actor, singer, and comedian.

He was born and raised in [[Sylacauga, Alabama]], but he moved to southern California because of his [[asthma]]. He was discovered by [[Andy Griffith]] while working at a [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]] nightclub, and he later joined ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'' as [[Gomer Pyle]]. The character proved popular, and Nabors was given his own spin-off show, ''[[Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.]]''

Nabors was known for his portrayal of Gomer Pyle, although he became a popular guest on variety shows which showcased his rich [[baritone]] singing voice in the 1960s and 1970s, including two specials of his own in 1969 and 1974. He subsequently recorded numerous albums and singles, most of them containing romantic [[ballad]]s.

Nabors was also known for singing "[[Back Home Again in Indiana]]" prior to the start of the [[Indianapolis 500]], held annually over the [[Memorial Day]] weekend. He sang the unofficial Indiana anthem almost every year from 1972 to 2014, except for occasional absences due to illness or scheduling conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nabors|first1=Jim|url=http://www.jimnabors.com/NationalSportsNews/|website=Jim Nabors - Official Website|title=Jim Nabors Can't Wait To Get Back Home Again|access-date=May 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jim|first1=Nabors|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wcgaRkHAWY|title=Jim Nabors' Last 'Back Home Again in Indiana' |year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of his [[asthma]], Nabors moved to Los Angeles and worked as a film cutter for [[NBC]]. He also worked at a [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]] tavern, The Horn, singing and acting in [[Cabaret|cabaret theater]].&lt;ref&gt;Brower, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jnhistory"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jimnabors.com/history.html |title=Jim Nabors History |publisher=JimNabors.com (official site) |access-date=November 10, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014231626/http://www.jimnabors.com/history.html |archivedate=October 14, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; His act featured him as a character similar to the later Gomer Pyle.

==Career==
===Breakthrough and popularity===
[[File:Don Knotts Jim Nabors Andy Griffith Show 1964.JPG|thumb|right|Nabors and [[Don Knotts]] in a publicity photo for ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'' (1964)]]
It was at The Horn where Nabors was discovered by [[Andy Griffith]] and was hired to play a one-shot role of Gomer Pyle, an "addlebrained" gas station attendant, on ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'' (Season 3, episode 13 - "The Bank Job").&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, p.50&lt;/ref&gt; Nabors' character (based on his act at The Horn) became so popular that he was made a regular on the show and was later given his own show, the spin-off ''[[Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.]]'', in which his character joined the [[United States Marine Corps]]. The show, which placed Nabors' bungling, naive character opposite Sergeant Vince Carter ([[Frank Sutton]]), was also popular.

Despite its run during the [[Vietnam War]], ''Gomer Pyle'' remained popular, because it avoided war-related themes and instead focused on the show's rural roots and the relationship between Pyle and Carter.&lt;ref name=olson96&gt;Olson, p.196&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/nabors_jim/bio.jhtml|title=Jim Nabors: Biography|publisher=[[Country Music Television]] |access-date=November 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&amp;sql=2:51668~T1 |title=Jim Nabors Biography |publisher=[[AllMovie]] |access-date=November 12, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060426195934/http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg |archivedate=April 26, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nabors resigned from ''Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.'' after five seasons—prompting producers [[Aaron Ruben]] and [[Sheldon Leonard]] to ask CBS to cancel it—because he desired to move to something else, "reach for another rung on the ladder, either up or down."&lt;ref name=Gomer&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=CwQVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=qwEEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2443,3314149&amp;dq=gomer+pyle&amp;hl=en Jim Nabors finished with Gomer].

===Singing career===
Nabors revealed his rich baritone voice first on the February 24, 1964, "The Song Festers" episode of ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'' and on April 8, 1964, on ''[[The Danny Kaye Show]],'' and subsequently capitalized on it with numerous successful recordings and live performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=UncJAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=I0gDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3145,4177445&amp;dq=jim+nabors|title=Jim Nabors Follows His Instincts to Fame|last=Scott|first=Vernon|date=June 10, 1970|work=[[The Bryan Times]]|page=16|access-date=November 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Meet Jim Nabors"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=sFhQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=81cDAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=jim%20nabors&amp;pg=7486%2C2030578|title=Meet Jim (Gomer) Nabors|last=Wright|first=Fred|date=January 22, 1973|work=[[St. Petersburg Times|St. Petersburg Independent]]|page=1-B|publisher=[[Times Publishing Company]]|access-date=November 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the songs were romantic ballads, though he sang pop, [[gospel music|gospel]], and [[country music|country]] songs as well.&lt;ref name="p135" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=5vULAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=f1cDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7264,4433053&amp;dq=jim+nabors|title=Jim Nabors Soars on Wings|last=Harold|first=Chuck|date=June 17, 1971|work=[[St. Petersburg Times|St. Petersburg Independent]]|publisher=[[Times Publishing Company]]|page=12-A|access-date=November 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pop to Opera"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xnJQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=jVoDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4208%2C1997669|title=Nabors' Range: Pop to Opera|last=Ober|first=Chick|work=[[St. Petersburg Times]]|page=23|publisher=[[Times Publishing Company]]|access-date=March 7, 2013|date=June 24, 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="allmusic" /&gt;

The climactic vocal performance on ''Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.'' came in an episode titled "The Show Must Go On," aired November 3, 1967, in which Pyle sang "[[The Impossible Dream (The Quest)]]" in Washington, D.C., at a U.S. Navy relief show, accompanied by the [[United States Marine Band|Marine Corps Band]]. A clip from the show, in which Pyle says the tag-line "Surprise, surprise, surprise!" appears in the [[Pink Floyd]] album ''[[The Wall]]'' in the song "[[Nobody Home]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Janovitz|first1=Bill|authorlink1=Bill Janovitz|title=Song Review: Nobody Home - Pink Floyd|url=https://www.allmusic.com/song/nobody-home-mt0042077671|website=AllMusic|publisher=RhythmOne group|accessdate=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He hosted a variety show, ''[[The Jim Nabors Hour]]'' (1969–1971), which featured his ''Gomer Pyle'' co-stars [[Ronnie Schell]] and Frank Sutton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,844903,00.html|title=Wednesday, September 24|date=September 26, 1969|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|access-date=November 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite a poor critical reception, the show was popular&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=fEILAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=SlIDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7098,598792&amp;dq=gomer+pyle|title=Television in Review|access-date=January 27, 2009|work=The Bryan Times|date=October 9, 1969|first=Vernon|last=Scott|page=B7|publisher=[[Deseret News Publishing Company]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=L7MLAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=qVUDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6887,2723171&amp;dq=gomer+pyle|title=Nabors to Plan Tour Show|access-date=January 27, 2009|work=[[Deseret News]]|date=May 12, 1971|first=Rick|last=Du Brow}}&lt;/ref&gt; and earned an Emmy nomination.&lt;ref name="Task &amp; Purpose"&gt;{{cite web|last1=DeSantis|first1=Rachel ,|title=Jim Nabors, Who Played TV's Lovable Marine Gomer Pyle, Dies At 87|url=http://taskandpurpose.com/jim-nabors-gomer-pyle/|website=Task &amp; Purpose|publisher=New York Daily News|access-date=November 30, 2017|date=November 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the cancellation of ''The Jim Nabors Hour,'' Nabors embarked on a nationwide roadshow.&lt;ref name="no complaints"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=B09NAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=qTUDAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=jim%20nabors&amp;pg=875%2C4021771|title=Jim Nabors Has No Complaints|date=May 30, 1971|work=[[Rome News-Tribune]]|publisher=News Publishing Company|page=5E|access-date=March 7, 2013|agency=[[United Press International]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nabors sang the national anthem before Game #1 of the 1973 World Series in Oakland.

===Later career===
Typecast from his role as Gomer Pyle, Nabors found his subsequent roles mostly comedic.&lt;ref name="p135"&gt;Kelly, p.135&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, he appeared in the children's television programs ''[[The Krofft Supershow]]'' and ''[[Buford and the Galloping Ghost]].'' He appeared in every [[season premiere]] of ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]],'' because Burnett considered him a "good-luck charm".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0DIMAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=VF8DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4892,1269071&amp;dq=jim+nabors+carol+burnett|title=Hanging on to Her Femininity Is Carol Burnett's Secret|first=Lawrence|last=Laurent|agency=Washington Post Service|date=August 10, 1975|work=[[St. Petersburg Times|St. Petersburg Independent]]|publisher=[[Times Publishing Company]]|page=12-A|access-date=November 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were so close that he became the godfather to her daughter Jody.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/newswires/entertainment/notable-reaction-death-actor-singer-jim-nabors-article-1.3668644|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180712000337/http://www.nydailynews.com/newswires/entertainment/notable-reaction-death-actor-singer-jim-nabors-article-1.3668644|archive-date=July 12, 2018|title=Notable reaction to the death of actor-singer Jim Nabors |work=[[New York Daily News]]|publisher=[[Tronc]]|author=[[Associated Press]]|date=November 30, 2017|accessdate=July 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1973 episode of ''[[The Rookies]],'' he played his first "serious" role, a man called on to be an [[assassination|assassin]] after the death of his sister.&lt;ref name="rookies"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800034746/bio|title=Jim Nabors Biography|publisher=Yahoo!|access-date=December 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZuINAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=_2wDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7317,2581598&amp;dq=jim+nabors|title=Complete Television Programs for Monday|date=November 19, 1973|work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|publisher=[[Block Communications]]|page=31|access-date=November 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1973, Nabors sang "[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]" before Game One of the [[Major League Baseball]] [[World Series]].&lt;ref name="NBC 1973 World Series theme introduction"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hh_ze-RvinU|title=NBC 1973 World Series Theme Introduction | access-date=April 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1977 to 1978, Nabors hosted another variety show, ''The Jim Nabors Show.'' Though the show lasted only one season, Nabors was nominated for a [[Daytime Emmy Award]] for Outstanding Host or Hostess in a Talk, Service or Variety Series.&lt;ref name="emmy" /&gt;
[[File:USMC-010809-M-9466S-159.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Nabors in 2001]]
Nabors eventually grew tired of the "prime-time TV grind" and abandoned television jobs for nightclub and concert engagements and a role in a touring production of ''[[Man of La Mancha]]''.&lt;ref name="allmusic"&gt;{{cite web | url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p14881|pure_url=yes}}| title=Jim Nabors|first=Jason|last=Ankeny|publisher=AllMusic |access-date=November 12, 2008}}Jim Neighbor guest starred on ''The Muppet Show'' during its first season in 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Sid and Marty Krofft]] persuaded Nabors to star in the Saturday-morning children's television show  ''[[The Lost Saucer]],'' about two bumbling [[Android (robot)|androids]], Fi ([[Ruth Buzzi]]) and Fum (Nabors), who travel through time with two children. Nabors, whose character was described as a "Gomer Pyle in outer space", sang in a few of the episodes.&lt;ref&gt;Erickson, p.141&lt;/ref&gt; Nabors also guest starred on episode 6 of season 1 of ''[[The Muppet Show]]''.&lt;ref name="muppets"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1976/09/26/archives/television-this-week.html|title=Television This Week|date=September 26, 1976|publisher=New York Times|access-date=December 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, Nabors appeared in three feature-length films starring his friend [[Burt Reynolds]], at the latter's request. In ''[[The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas (film)|The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas]]'' (1982), about a sheriff (Reynolds) who falls in love with a [[brothel]] [[Procuring (prostitution)|madam]] ([[Dolly Parton]]), Nabors played Deputy Fred, a character similar to Gomer Pyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=JO4LAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=J1kDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5101,37194&amp;dq=jim+nabors+whorehouse|title=Burt and Dolly Are Wonderful Together|publisher=[[Times Publishing Company]]|work=[[Tampa Bay Times|St. Petersburg Times]]|access-date=December 29, 2008|date=July 16, 1982|page=4-A|first=Shirley|last=Eder}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=y0ENAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=n20DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7173,5349681|title='Whorehouse' Loses in Translation|last=Anderson|first=George|date=July 26, 1982|work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|publisher=[[Block Communications]]|pages=B2|access-date=November 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the film was given mostly unfavorable reviews, Nabors garnered some positive comments for his performance.&lt;ref name="Worst Little Musical"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=QfVSAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=LoMDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7053%2C8449121|title=Worst Little Musical in Texas|work=[[Deseret News]]|date=July 30–31, 1982|access-date=March 7, 2013|first=Christopher|last=Hicks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, he was cast as an auto mechanic in ''[[Stroker Ace]],'' starring Burt Reynolds as a race car driver who fights a fried-chicken chain entrepreneur. The film was panned, and Nabors earned a [[Golden Raspberry Awards|Golden Raspberry Award]] for his performance.&lt;ref name="raspberry" /&gt; In Reynolds' star-studded ''[[Cannonball Run II]]'' (1984), about a cross-country car chase, Nabors made a cameo appearance alongside such celebrities as [[Dom DeLuise]], [[Jackie Chan]], [[Shirley MacLaine]], [[Dean Martin]], [[Frank Sinatra]], and ''Andy Griffith Show'' co-stars [[Don Knotts]] and [[George Lindsey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=PI&amp;s_site=philly&amp;p_multi=PI&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB297DAC7F5D4E2&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|title='Cannonball' Sequel Is Simply Loaded With Stars|publisher=[[Philadelphia Media Holdings]]|work=[[Philadelphia Inquirer]]|access-date=December 29, 2008|date=June 30, 1984}} (Paid access required to view article.)&lt;/ref&gt; Like the two previous Reynolds films Nabors appeared in, ''Cannonball'' received mostly negative reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/cannonball_run_2/|title=Cannonball Run 2|publisher=[[News Corp]]|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|access-date=December 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After moving to Hawaii from [[Bel Air, Los Angeles|Bel Air, California]] with his partner Stan Cadwallader in 1976, he launched a show, "The Jim Nabors Polynesian Extravaganza" at the [[Hilton Hawaiian Village]], which ran for two years. Nabors eventually experienced "bright-light burnout" and disappeared from the stage, save for an occasional performance. In 1984, after a five-year hiatus, Nabors returned to performing, starring in the "Moulin Rouge" show at the [[Westgate Las Vegas Resort &amp; Casino|Las Vegas Hilton]] and other shows in [[Reno, Nevada|Reno]] and [[Las Vegas Strip|Las Vegas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Y-UOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=9oIDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7073,324816&amp;dq=gomer+pyle|title=Nabors Stages Reluctant Comeback|work=[[Deseret News]]|date=August 1, 1984|access-date=January 27, 2009|publisher=[[Deseret News Publishing Company]]|first=Robert|last=Macy|page=8 EV}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, he  made his theatrical debut as Harold Hill in ''[[The Music Man]]'' with [[Florence Henderson]] at the Burt Reynolds Dinner Theatre in [[Jupiter, Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DH0LAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=OFMDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6985,6919052|title=Jim Nabors Brings Flavor of Mayberry to Riverside|work=Mojave Daily Miner|date=October 16–22, 1990|access-date=December 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Silverstein|first1=Brittany|title=Burt Reynolds Remembers Jim Nabors|url=http://cbs12.com/news/local/burt-reynolds-remembers-jim-nabors|access-date=December 1, 2017|work=CBS12 - WPEC|date=November 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, Nabors suffered from a near-fatal case of [[hepatitis B]]. According to Nabors, he contracted the disease while traveling in India; he shaved with a [[straight razor]] and "whacked [his] face all up."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=GDAKAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=4UoDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7016,882076&amp;dq=gomer+pyle+usmc|title=Gomer Groaning|work=The Victoria Advocate|publisher=Victoria Advocate Publishing Co.|date=January 6, 1994|page=5B|access-date=January 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The disease caused liver failure, and Nabors was given a dim prognosis; however, his friend [[Carol Burnett]] made an arrangement with the transplant division of [[University of California, Los Angeles]] and secured Nabors a transplant.&lt;ref name= "AmericanProfile" /&gt; Nabors later became involved with the [[American Liver Foundation]] as a result of his experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.khnl.com/Global/story.asp?S=6249608|title=Interview with Jim Nabors|publisher=[[Raycom Media]]|work=[[KHNL]]|date=March 20, 2007|access-date=December 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after recovering from his transplant, Nabors embarked on another tour, with stops in Phoenix, St. Louis, and Washington.&lt;ref name="Knight Ridder 1995"&gt;{{closed access}} {{cite news|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-6328103_ITM|title=People in the News|agency=[[Knight Ridder]]|via=AccessMyLibrary.com|access-date=January 27, 2009|first=Cheryl|last=Levenbrown|date=February 28, 1995|subscription=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100606064030/http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-6328103_ITM|archivedate=June 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1997 to 2006, Nabors starred in the Burton White-produced ''A Merry Christmas with Friends and Nabors,'' a live performance at the [[Hawaii Theatre]] Center in [[Honolulu]]. The production, featuring local and national artists, ran for 40 performances and was directed by Tom Hansen until Hansen's death in 2006.

===Retirement===
From 1972 to 2014, Nabors sang "[[Back Home Again in Indiana]]" with the [[Purdue All-American Marching Band]] before each [[Indianapolis 500]] race.&lt;ref name="honolulu" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/wire?section=auto&amp;id=2882785|title='Back Home Again,' Jim Nabors intertwined in Indy 500 tradition|publisher=[[ESPN]]|access-date=November 22, 2008|agency=[[Associated Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2014, Nabors announced that the [[2014 Indianapolis 500]] would be his final appearance, saying that his health was limiting his ability to travel.&lt;ref name="Kim 2014-03-21"&gt;{{cite web |first=Jaimie |last=Kim |title=Lifestyle &amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F; Old Friends: Jim Nabors |url=http://www.midweek.com/jim-nabors/ |publisher=Oahu Publications |location=Honolulu, HI |date=March 21, 2014 |access-date=March 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his retirement from this role, the singing of "Back Home Again in Indiana" is now done on a rotating basis (as it had been before Nabors became the regular singer).

==Personal life==
Nabors began vacationing in Hawaii in the 1960s, and in 1976, moved from Bel Air, California, to Honolulu, Hawaii. For 25 years, he owned a [[macadamia]] [[plantation]] on [[Maui]] before selling it to the [[National Tropical Botanical Garden]], a [[conservation movement|conservationist]] organization, though he still retained farming rights to the land and owned a second home on the property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.midweek.com/content/columns/oldfriends_article/jim_nabors/ |title=Jim Nabors |first=Matt |last=Tuohy |date=July 16, 2008 |work=[[Midweek (magazine)|Midweek]] |location=Hawaii |access-date=December 7, 2008 |publisher=MidWeek Printing, Inc.

[[File:2010 - Actor Jim Nabors.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Nabors in 2010]]
Nabors married his partner of 38 years, Stan Cadwallader, at [[Seattle, Washington]]'s [[Fairmont Olympic Hotel]] on January 15, 2013, a month after [[same-sex marriage]] became legal in [[Washington (state)|Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/story/20805642/exclusive-actor-jim-nabors-marries-his-longtime-male-partner |title=EXCLUSIVE: Actor Jim Nabors marries his longtime male partner – Hawaii News Now – KGMB and KHNL |publisher=Hawaii News Now |date= |access-date=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.seattletimes.com/today/2013/01/gomer-pyle-usmc-star-jim-nabors-marries-male-partner-in-seattle/ |title=‘Gomer Pyle, USMC’ star Jim Nabors marries male partner in Seattle &amp;#124; The Today File &amp;#124; Seattle Times |publisher=Blogs.seattletimes.com |date=January 29, 2013 |access-date=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mynorthwest.com/174/2188026/Actor-Jim-Nabors-marries-male-partner-in-Seattle |title=Actor Jim Nabors marries male partner in Seattle – AP State |publisher=MyNorthwest.com |date=January 29, 2013 |access-date=December 5, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113092758/http://mynorthwest.com/174/2188026/Actor-Jim-Nabors-marries-male-partner-in-Seattle |archivedate=November 13, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They had met in the 1970s, when Cadwallader was a fireman in Honolulu, and began dating in 1975.  Although he had been closeted before this, his sexual orientation was not completely secret; for instance, Nabors brought his then-boyfriend Cadwallader along to his Indy 500 performance in 1978.&lt;ref name=MMotor&gt;{{cite journal | journal = [[Motor (magazine)|Modern Motor]] | page = 82 | quotation = Nabors, who was accompanied by a rather pretty male friend, was to sing... | title = The Three-Hour Yawn | first = Peter | last = McKay | date = September 1978 | publisher = Modern Magazines (Holdings) Ltd | location = Rushcutters Bay, NSW, Australia | volume = 25 | number = 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allegations about Rock Hudson===
A longstanding rumor maintains that Nabors "married" [[Rock Hudson]] in the early 1970s, shortly before Nabors began his relationship with Cadwallader.&lt;ref name="Snopes" /&gt;

Not only was same-sex marriage not yet legal in any U.S. state at the time, at least publicly, the two were never more than friends.&lt;ref name="NYTobit"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/30/obituaries/jim-nabors-87-tvs-gomer-pyle-is-dead.html|title=Jim Nabors, 87, TV's Gomer Pyle, Is Dead|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=November 30, 2017|access-date=November 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hudson, the story originated with a group of "middle-aged [[Homosexuality|homosexuals]] who live in [[Huntington Beach, California|Huntington Beach]]", who sent out joke invitations for their annual get-together.&lt;ref name="NYTobit" /&gt; One year, the group invited its members to witness "the marriage of Rock Hudson and Jim Nabors", at which Hudson would take the surname of Nabors' most famous character, [[Gomer Pyle]], becoming "Rock Pyle".&lt;ref name="Snopes" /&gt; The rumor was spread by those who failed to get the joke, and because Nabors was still [[closeted]] at the time and Hudson never publicly admitted to being gay (despite widespread suspicion that he was), the two never spoke to each other again.&lt;ref name="Snopes"&gt;{{cite web |first = Barbara | last = Mikkelson |title=Good Nabors Policy |url=http://www.snopes.com/movies/actors/nabors.asp |publisher=Snopes |date=August 10, 2007 |access-date=September 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
