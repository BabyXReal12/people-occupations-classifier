'''Jane Therese Curtin''' (born September 6, 1947) is an American actress and comedian. She is sometimes referred to as "Queen of the [[Deadpan]]"; ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' once called her a "refreshing drop of acid."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/queen-of-deadpan-jane-curtin-on-old-school-snl/|title="Queen of Deadpan" Jane Curtin on old school "SNL"|last=Cochran|first=Amanda|work=[[CBS News]]|date=26 July 2013|access-date=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Collins |first= William B. |title= Midwestern Shaw – Why, Oh, Why Didn't They Leave Out Ohio? |work= [[The Philadelphia Inquirer]] |date= October 17, 1981 |url= http://infoweb.newsbank.com/iw-search/we/InfoWeb?p_product=AWNB&amp;p_theme=aggregated5&amp;p_action=doc&amp;p_docid=0EB2935D48929750&amp;p_docnum=4&amp;p_queryname=2 |page= B11 |access-date= April 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was included on a 1986 list of the "Top Prime Time Actors and Actresses of All Time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Du Brow |first=Rick |title=Who Are the Top Prime Time Actors and Actresses of All Time? |work=''[[Times Union (Albany)|Times Union]]'' |location=Albany, NY |date=August 8, 1986 |url=http://alb.merlinone.net/mweb/wmsql.wm.request?oneimage&amp;imageid=5449726 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130703063459/http://alb.merlinone.net/mweb/wmsql.wm.request?oneimage&amp;imageid=5449726 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 3, 2013 |quote=A quietly devastating performer amid all the scene-stealers on ''Saturday Night Live'', Curtin was most memorable as the deadpan, long-suffering anchor on the show's "news updates". In ''Kate and Allie'', she is demonstrating another hugely appealing facet of her remarkably versatile repertoire. |page=15A |access-date=April 14, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

First coming to prominence as an original cast member on the hit TV comedy series ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in 1975, she went on to win back-to-back [[Emmy Award]]s for Best Lead Actress in a Comedy Series on the 1980s sitcom ''[[Kate &amp; Allie]]'' portraying the role of Allison "Allie" Lowell. Curtin later starred in the hit series ''[[3rd Rock from the Sun]]'' (1996–2001), playing the role of [[Mary Albright|Dr. Mary Albright]].

Curtin has also appeared in many movie roles, including [[List of The Librarian characters#Charlene (Jane Curtin)|Charlene]] in ''[[The Librarian (franchise)|The Librarian]]'' series of movies (2004–2008). She also reprised one of her ''Saturday Night Live'' characters, Prymaat (Clorhone) Conehead, in the 1993 film ''[[Coneheads (film)|Coneheads]]''.

== Personal life ==
Curtin was born in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], the daughter of Mary Constance (née Farrell) and John Joseph Curtin, who owned an insurance agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/79/Jane-Curtin.html|title=Jane Curtin Biography (1947-)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She grew up in [[Wellesley, Massachusetts]], and graduated from Convent of the Sacred Heart, [[Elmhurst Academy]] in [[Portsmouth, Rhode Island]] in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800039331/bio|title=Jane Curtin|publisher=[[Yahoo! Movies]]|date=|access-date=May 13, 2010|first=|last=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She married Patrick Francis Lynch (a television producer) on April 2, 1975; they have one daughter, Tess Curtin Lynch, born in 1983.&lt;ref name="CTFT" /&gt; They live in [[Sharon, Connecticut]].

She has a brother, Larry Curtin, who lives in [[South Florida]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Talley |first= Jim |title= Investors Star In Film Financing |work= [[Sun-Sentinel]] |location= Fort Lauderdale, Florida |date= August 18, 1986 |url= http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1986-08-18/business/8602180950_1_film-tax-code-market |access-date= April 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; their older brother, John J. "Jack" Curtin, died in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= John J. Curtin [obituary] |work= [[Boston Herald]] |date= September 24, 2008 |url= http://bostonherald.com/2008/09/john_j_curtin_0 |access-date= April 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was raised a Roman Catholic. Curtin is a cousin of actress and writer [[Valerie Curtin]]. Her uncle was the radio personality Joseph Curtin.

== Career ==
Curtin holds an associate degree from [[Elizabeth Seton College|Elizabeth Seton Junior College]] in New York City, class of 1967. She then attended [[Northeastern University]] from 1967 to 1968.

She has served as a U.S. Committee National Ambassador for [[United Nations Children's Fund|UNICEF]]. In 1968, Curtin decided to pursue comedy as a career and dropped out of college. She joined a comedy group, "The Proposition", and performed with them until 1972. She starred in ''Pretzels'', an off-Broadway play written by Curtin, [[John Forster (musician)|John Forster]], [[Judith Kahan]] and [[Fred Grandy]], in 1974.

=== ''Saturday Night Live'' ===
One of the original "[[Not Ready For Prime Time Players]]" for [[NBC]]'s ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (1975), Curtin remained on the show through the 1979–1980 season. Guest host [[Eric Idle]] said that Curtin was "very much a 'Let's come in, let's know our lines, let's do it properly, and go' ... She was very sensible, very focused", and disliked the drug culture that many of the cast participated in. Show writer [[Al Franken]] stated that she "was so steady. Had a really strong moral center, and as such was disgusted by much of the show and the people around it".&lt;ref name="snl20050220"&gt;{{cite episode | title=Live From New York: The First 5 Years of Saturday Night Live | series=Saturday Night Live | network=NBC | airdate=2005-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On this show, and mirroring her own low-key real life, she frequently played [[Double act|straight-woman]] characters, often as a [[wikt:foil#Etymology 1|foil]] to [[John Belushi]] and [[Gilda Radner]]. Curtin anchored ''SNL''&amp;apos;s "[[Weekend Update]]" segment from 1976 to 1977, and was paired with [[Dan Aykroyd]] from 1977 to 1978 and [[Bill Murray]] from 1978 to 1980. On occasional Weekend Update segments, her newscaster character served as a foil to John Belushi, who often gave a rambling and out-of-control "commentary" on events of the day. During these sketches, she timidly tried to get Belushi to come to the point, which would only make him angrier. Curtin's newscaster also introduced baseball expert [[Chico Escuela]] ([[Garrett Morris]]), a heavily accented [[Dominican Republic|Dominican]], who started his sketches by saying, "Thank you, ''Hane''", before repeating his famous catchphrase, "Baseball been bery, bery good to me!" She also sang in the "Chevy's Girls" sketch in season 2, episode 2, alongside [[Laraine Newman]] and [[Gilda Radner]].

In a parody of the "Point-Counterpoint" segment of the news program ''[[60 Minutes]]'', Curtin delivered a controlled liberal viewpoint (à la [[Shana Alexander]]) vs. Dan Aykroyd, who (in the manner of [[James J. Kilpatrick]]) epitomized the [[right-wing politics|right wing]] view, albeit with an over-the-top "attack" journalist slant.  Curtin presented the [[liberal politics|liberal]] "Point" portion first. Then Aykroyd presented the "Counterpoint" portion, sometimes beginning with the statement, "Jane, you ignorant [[wikt:slut|slut]]," to which she replied, "Dan, you pompous ass." The recurring segment has been discussed in an article on "How to Respectfully Disagree" in ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://chronicle.com/article/Two-Professors-One-Valuable/48901/ |last1= Polk |first1= Bryan |first2= Mel |last2= Seesholtz |title= Two Professors, One Valuable Lesson: How to Respectfully Disagree |journal= [[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] |location= Washington, D.C. |volume= 56 |issue= 10 |date= Oct 25, 2009 |access-date= April 14, 2013}} {{subscription required|s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Curtin is also well known for her role in the [[The Coneheads|Conehead]] sketches as Prymaat (wife/mother of the Conehead family), and as Enid Loopner (in sketches with [[Gilda Radner]] and [[Bill Murray]]). She is one of many cast members who appear in the retrospective compilation DVD ''The Women of SNL'' (2010, 97 minutes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.worldcat.org/title/women-of-snl/oclc/795402925&amp;referer=brief_results |title= The Women of SNL |publisher= [[WorldCat]] |year= 2012 |access-date= April 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Later television work ===
Unlike many of her fellow ''SNL'' cast members who ventured successfully into film, Curtin chose to stay in television. Her film appearances have been sporadic. To date, she has starred in two long-running television sitcoms. First, in ''[[Kate &amp; Allie]]'' (1984–89), with [[Susan Saint James]], she played a single mother named "Allie Lowell" and twice won the Emmy Award for Best Lead Actress in a Comedy Series.

She later joined the cast of ''[[3rd Rock from the Sun]]'' (1996–2001) playing a human, [[Mary Albright|Dr. Mary Albright]], opposite the alien family, composed of [[John Lithgow]], [[Kristen Johnston]], [[French Stewart]], and [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]]. As with ''SNL'', her mostly strait-laced character was often confounded by the zany and whimsical antics of the Solomon family.

In 1997, Curtin narrated two episodes of the documentary television series ''[[Understanding (TV series)|Understanding]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1041883/ |title= Understanding (1994–2004) |publisher= [[Internet Movie Database]] |access-date= April 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She has done voice work for ''[[Recess (TV series)|Recess]]'', and ''[[Cyberchase]]''; she also guest starred on ''[[Sesame Street]]'' in 1985.

Curtin also starred with [[Fred Savage]] in the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] sitcom ''[[Crumbs]]'', which debuted in January 2006 and was canceled in May of that year. She also guest-starred on ''[[Gary Unmarried]]'' as Connie, Allison's mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/listings/20081110cbs08/|title=Listings – TheFutonCritic.com – The Web's Best Television Resource|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, she joined ''[[Unforgettable (2011 TV series)|Unforgettable]]'' as Dr. Joanne Webster, a gifted but crusty [[medical examiner]].

=== Film ===
In 1980, Jane starred with Susan Saint James and Jessica Lange in the moderate hit ''[[How to Beat the High Cost of Living]]''. In 1993, Curtin and Dan Aykroyd were reunited in ''[[Coneheads]]'', a full-length motion picture based on their popular ''SNL'' characters. They also appeared together as the voices of a pair of wasps in the film ''[[Antz]].'' In 2009, she played [[Paul Rudd]] and [[Andy Samberg]]'s mother in ''[[I Love You, Man]]''. In 2013 she took a small role in ''[[The Heat (film)|The Heat]]'' as Mrs. Mullins, the mother of Detective Mullins.

=== Other work ===
Curtin has also performed on Broadway on occasion.  She first appeared on the [[Great White Way]] as Miss Proserpine Garnett in the play ''[[Candida (play)|Candida]]'' in 1981.  She later went on to be a replacement actress in two other plays: ''[[Love Letters (play)|Love Letters]]'' and ''[[Noises Off]]'', and was in the 2002 revival of ''[[Our Town]]'', which received huge press attention as [[Paul Newman]] returned to the Broadway stage after several decades away.

She also has narrated several audio books, including [[Carl Hiaasen]]'s novel ''[[Nature Girl (novel)|Nature Girl]]''.

On May 7, 2010, Curtin placed second in the ''Jeopardy! Million Dollar Celebrity Invitational'', winning $250,000 for the U.S. Fund for [[UNICEF]]. [[Michael McKean]] won the tournament, while [[Cheech Marin]] came in third.

She presented the [[Emmy Award]]s in 1984, 1987, and 1998; the 11th Annual [[American Comedy Awards]] in 1997; and the 54th Annual [[Golden Globe Award]]s in 1997.&lt;ref name="CTFT"&gt;{{cite book |chapter= Jane Curtin |title= Contemporary Theatre, Film and Television |editor= Thomas Riggs |location= Detroit |publisher= Gale |year= 2012 |volume= 118 |page= |isbn=978-1-4144-8202-6 |oclc=781178307}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Curtin has guest hosted several episodes of Selected Shorts produced by Symphony Space and distributed by Public Radio International.
