'''Dave Spikey''' (born '''David Gordon Bramwell''', 6 October 1951)&lt;ref name="grobirth"/&gt; is an English comedian, actor, writer and film producer. He is best known for his [[stand-up comedy]], writing and starring in the British comedy programme ''[[Phoenix Nights]]'', presenting quiz shows such as ''[[Bullseye (UK game show)|Bullseye]]'' and ''[[Chain Letters]]'' and playing team captain in the first four series of ''[[8 Out of 10 Cats]]''.

==Biography==

===Early career===
Born in [[Farnworth]], Lancashire, Spikey spent his early career working as a [[biomedical scientist]] in the [[haematology]] laboratory at Bolton General Hospital. It was during this period in the 1980s that Spikey scripted and performed in a number of amateur [[pantomime]]s with a group of like-minded health workers called the Bolton Health Performers.&lt;ref name="dr2017"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fulton|first1=Rick|title=Laughter helped to get me through in times of tragedy, says comic Dave Spikey|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/entertainment/celebrity/laughter-helped-to-get-me-through-in-times-of-tragedy-1036954|website=Daily Record|accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in his career Spikey won a talent show called Stairway to the Stars with a routine about juggling on a motorbike, judged by legendary comedian [[Larry Grayson]] who took him aside to tell him he had potential and his routine was fantastic. Spikey was inspired to pursue a part time comedy career while working in Bolton General Hospital.&lt;ref name="lt2017"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Anson|first1=John|title=Comedy king Dave Spikey celebrates 30 years as a stand-up with show heading to King George's Hall, Blackburn|url=http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/leisure/features_lancashiretelegraph/15615406.Comedy_king_Dave_Spikey_celebrates_30_years_as_a_stand_up_with_show_heading_to_King_George_s_Hall__Blackburn/|website=Lancashire Telegraph|accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, Spikey was asked to form a double act with Rick Sykes, as purely a 'one-off' to support a popular musical duo called 'Intaglio'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intaglioproject.com The Intaglio Project]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070915200843/http://www.intaglioproject.com/ |date=15 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dave and Rick were known as Spikey and Sykey. The double act's most notable success came on [[ITV Central|Central TV]]'s ''[[New Faces]]'' show.
In 1993 he was voted "best up and coming comedian" by the Manchester Evening news.

In 1996 Spikey first met [[Peter Kay]], with whom he would later collaborate, at the North-West Comedian of the Year Awards which Kay won that year&lt;ref name="yep2017"&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview: Dave Spikey|url=https://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/whats-on/theatre/interview-dave-spikey-1-7176439|website=Yorkshire Evening Post|accessdate=19 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Spikey was [[Master of ceremonies#Comedy clubs|compèring]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hogan|first1=Michael|title=Peter Kay: comedy grafter gets back in the driving seat|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/apr/08/peter-kay-comedy-grafter-car-share-second-series|website=The Guardian|accessdate=19 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the final host of UK gameshow ''[[Chain Letters]]'' in 1997, following on from [[Jeremy Beadle]], [[Andrew O'Connor (actor)|Andrew O'Connor]], [[Allan Stewart (comedian)|Allan Stewart]], [[Ted Robbins]] and [[Vince Henderson]].

===Success===
Spikey won the Best Newcomer award at the [[British Comedy Awards]], and then co-wrote and starred in ''[[Peter Kay's Phoenix Nights|Phoenix Nights]]'' on [[Channel Four]] as [[Jerry St. Clair#Jerry .27St. Clair.27 Dignan|Jerry St. Clair]]. In 2003, Spikey released his first DVD, ''The Overnight Success Tour''. 2003 was also the year he won ‘Best Comedy Performance at Leicester Comedy Festival 2003’, an award he describes as “the weirdest trophy I’ve got on my shelf.”&lt;ref name="lm2018"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jones|first1=Becky|title=Phoenix Nights comedian Dave Spikey speaks to us about Juggling on a Motorbike at Leicester Comedy Festival|url=https://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/phoenix-nights-comedian-dave-spikey-1143034|website=Leicester Mercury|accessdate=26 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late  2004, he wrote the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] comedy-drama ''[[Dead Man Weds]]'' (2005), in which he also co-starred with [[Johnny Vegas]]. The drama follows the attempts of the new editor (Spikey) of the local newspaper, ''The Fogburrow Advertiser and News'', to drum up excitement in the area to cover in his paper, to the disdain and disinterest of his lead (and only) reporter (Vegas). [[Nancy Banks-Smith]] described the drama as “endearing and cheerful.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Banks-Smith|first1=Nancy|title=The village voice|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/jan/13/television.artsfeatures|website=The Guardian|accessdate=26 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Spikey became one of the regular team captains on the comedy [[panel game]], ''[[8 Out of 10 Cats]]'', leaving before the 2007 series. That year also saw the release of his second live DVD, ''Living the Dream''.

In 2006, Spikey became the host of a revived version of the darts-based quiz show ''[[Bullseye (UK game show)|Bullseye]]''. The show ran for two series on [[Challenge (TV channel)|Challenge]] to generally unfavourable reviews, ''[[The Guardian]]'' calling it an “abhorrent reboot.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dawson|first1=Andy|title=Late risers more likely to die early? Wake me up from this nightmare|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/13/late-risers-die-early-nightmare-late-night-tv-health-night-owls|website=The Guardian|accessdate=26 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spikey developed two new projects which were commissioned by the BBC, being ''Magnolia'', a sitcom about painters and decorators, and ''Footballers Lives'' – a comedy about a pub football team, neither made it beyond pilots. He was also on the panel for talent show ''[[When Will I Be Famous? (TV series)|When Will I Be Famous?]]''. Spikey returned to stand-up and live shows again and has regularly released DVDs of his shows. His chosen subject on ''[[Celebrity Mastermind]]'' in 2006 was human blood; he won.

In 2010 Spikey was voted into the [[Channel 4]] ''100 Greatest Stand-Ups'' by the British public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bryson|first1=Ann|title=The 100 Greatest Stand-Ups|url=https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/100_greatest_stand_ups/episodes/1/2/|website=British Comedy Guide|accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 he appeared as a self-obsessed businessman, Mr Gruff, in British romantic comedy film ''[[Finding Fatimah]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Finding Fatimah official website|url=http://www.findingfatimah.com/|accessdate=3 Feb 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McLaughlin|first1=Katherine|title=Finding Fatimah|url=https://film.list.co.uk/article/90356-finding-fatimah/|website=The List|accessdate=21 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spikey celebrated 30 years in stand up with a new retrospective, ''Juggling on a Motorbike'' which began touring in 2017. The title refers back to his very first live performances which began his career in comedy, a routine which he recreates at the end of his show. The show is largely autobiographical and follows his performances over the past 30 years of stand up.&lt;ref name="lm2018" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Anson|first1=John|title=Comedy king Dave Spikey celebrates 30 years as a stand-up with show heading to King George's Hall, Blackburn|url=http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/leisure/features_lancashiretelegraph/15615406.Comedy_king_Dave_Spikey_celebrates_30_years_as_a_stand_up_with_show_heading_to_King_George_s_Hall__Blackburn/|website=Lancashire Telegraph|accessdate=26 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other interests===
Dave Spikey is patron of the non-profit radio station [[Chorley FM]] (not to be confused with fictitious radio station made famous by ''That Peter Kay Thing'' and ''Phoenix Nights'').&lt;ref name="chor2017"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Day|first1=Julia|title=Laughter stops at Chorley FM|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/sep/14/commercialradio.broadcasting|website=The Guardian|accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Spikey's first book, ''He Took My Kidney, Then Broke My Heart'', was published in October 2009 by [[Michael O'Mara Books]]. This was followed in 2010 by a biography, ''Under the Microscope: My Life'' from the same publisher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Author Dave Spikey|url=https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/494790.Dave_Spikey|website=Goodreads|accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spikey is a supporter of the [[League Against Cruel Sports]] and appeared in a short film for the group in 2013. He has been quoted: "It is shocking to think anyone would want to turn the clock back to a time when chasing animals to exhaustion and encouraging them to be ripped apart by a pack of dogs for sport was legal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/eight-out-of-ten-want-to-keep-fox-hunting-ban-9025347.html|title= Eight out of ten want to keep fox hunting ban|work=The Independent|first=Jonathan|last=Owen|date=25 December 2013|accessdate=26 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He describes himself as a “devout vegetarian and animal lover” as well as being the patron of Pet Rehome, a Bolton based animal rescue centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Homepage|url=https://www.petrehome.org|website=Pet Rehome|accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
