'''William Alexander "Bud" Abbott''' (October 2, 1897 – April 24, 1974) was an American actor of burlesque, radio, stage, television and film, producer, and comedian. He is best remembered as the [[Double act|"straight man"]] of the comedy duo [[Abbott and Costello]], along with [[Lou Costello]].&lt;ref name=nytobit/&gt; Abbott was active for over 30 years, appearing in both television and film roles.

==Early life==
Abbott was born in [[Asbury Park, New Jersey]] on October 2, 1897, into a [[show business]] family.&lt;ref name=nytobit/&gt;&lt;ref name=dob&gt;The year of birth has been reported as 1895, 1896, 1897, and 1898 in different sources. The 1895 date was perpetuated by sources copying from earlier sources. His birth certificate and World War I draft card both use "October 2, 1897".&lt;/ref&gt; His parents, Rae Fisher and Harry Abbott, had worked for the [[Barnum and Bailey Circus]].&lt;ref name="http://www.biography.com/people/bud-abbott-20617237"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/bud-abbott-20617237|title=Bud Abbott |publisher=biography.com|accessdate=November 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=The funsters|author1=Parish, J.R.|author2=Leonard, W.T.|date=1979|publisher=Arlington House|isbn=9780870004186|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zn1ZAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=November 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several years after the family relocated to Brooklyn, Abbott dropped out of grammar school and began working summers with his father at Dreamland Park on [[Coney Island]]. When he was 15, Abbott signed on as a cabin boy on a Norwegian steamer but was soon forced to shovel coal. He eventually worked his way back to the United States after a year.

His father was a longtime advance man for the [[Columbia Burlesque Wheel]], and he installed Bud in the box office of the [[Casino Theatre (New York, New York)|Casino Theater]] in [[Brooklyn]]. Bud spent the next few years in burlesque box offices. In 1918, working in Washington, D.C., he met and married Jenny Mae Pratt, a burlesque dancer, and comedian who performed as Betty Smith. They remained together until his death 55 years later. In 1923 Abbott produced a cut-rate [[vaudeville]] [[tab show]] called ''Broadway Flashes'', which toured on the Gus Sun circuit.&lt;ref&gt;Slide, Anthony. ''The Encyclopedia of Vaudeville.'' Westport, Connecticut, Greenwood Press, 1994, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Abbott began performing as a [[Straight man (stock character)|straight man]] in the show when he could no longer afford to pay one. He continued producing and performing in burlesque shows on the Mutual Burlesque wheel, and as his reputation grew, he began working with veteran comedians like [[Harry Steppe]] and Harry Evanson.&lt;ref name="Furmanek 1991"&gt;Furmanek, Bob and Ron Palumbo (1991). ''Abbott and Costello in Hollywood''. New York: Perigee Books. {{ISBN|0-399-51605-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abbott suffered from [[epilepsy]] starting from about 1926.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Bob (1977). "Bud and Lou: the Abbott and Costello Story." Philadelphia: J.B. Lippincott. {{ISBN|0-397-01195-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964, he suffered the first in a series of [[stroke]]s.&lt;ref name="Furmanek 1991"/&gt;

==Career==
===Lou Costello and Hollywood===
Abbott crossed paths with [[Lou Costello]] in burlesque a few times in the early 1930s when Abbott was producing and performing in [[Minsky's Burlesque]] shows and Costello was a rising comic. They first worked together in stock burlesque in 1935 at the [[Eltinge Theatre]] on 42nd Street, after an illness sidelined Costello's regular partner.&lt;ref name=EB&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last= |first= |authorlink= |editor-first= |editor-last= |editor-link= |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|title=Abbott, Bud; and Costello, Lou |edition=15th |year=2010| publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.|volume=I: A-Ak - Bayes|location= Chicago, Illinois|isbn=978-1-59339-837-8|pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; They formally teamed up in 1936, and went on to perform together in burlesque, vaudeville, [[minstrel show]]s, and stage shows.&lt;ref name=nytobit/&gt;

In 1938, they received national exposure as regulars on the ''[[Kate Smith]] Hour'' [[radio]] show, which led to roles in a [[Broadway musical]], ''[[The Streets of Paris]]''. In 1940, [[Universal Studios|Universal]] signed the team for their first film, ''[[One Night in the Tropics]]''. Despite having minor roles, Abbott and Costello stole the film with several classic routines, including an abbreviated version of "[[Who's On First?]]"&lt;ref name="Furmanek 1991"/&gt;

During [[World War II]], Abbott and Costello were among the most popular and highest-paid stars in the world. Between 1940 and 1956 they made 36 films and earned a percentage of the profits on each.&lt;ref name="Furmanek 1991"/&gt; They had their own radio program ([[The Abbott and Costello Show (radio program)|The Abbott and Costello Show]]) throughout the 1940s, first on [[NBC]] from 1942 to 1947, and from 1947 to 1949 on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. In the 1950s, they introduced their comedy to live television on ''[[The Colgate Comedy Hour]]'', and launched their own half-hour series, ''[[The Abbott and Costello Show]]''.

Abbott was very supportive of his relatives. Norman and Betty Abbott, the children of Bud's older sister, Olive, started their careers working behind the scenes on Abbott and Costello films. Betty became [[Blake Edwards]]' longtime script supervisor, and Norman directed many television sitcoms, including the [[Jack Benny Show]] and [[Sanford and Son]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

===Strain and split===
Relations between Abbott and Costello were strained by egos and salary disputes. In their burlesque days they split their earnings 60%–40%, favoring Abbott, because the [[wiktionary:straight man|straight man]] was always viewed as the more valuable member of the team. This was eventually changed to 50%–50%, but after a year in Hollywood, Costello insisted on a 60%–40% split in his favor, and it remained so for the remainder of their careers. Costello also demanded that the team be renamed "Costello and Abbott," but this was rejected by Universal Studios, resulting in a "permanent chill" between the two partners, according to Lou's daughter Chris Costello in her biography ''Lou's on First''. Their relationship was further strained by Abbott's alcohol abuse, a habit motivated by his desire to stave off epileptic seizures.

The team's popularity waned in the 1950s, and they were bedeviled by tax issues; the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] demanded heavy back taxes, forcing the partners (both of whom had been free spenders and serious gamblers) to sell most of their assets, including the rights to many of their films. Universal dropped their contract after 14 years in 1955. Abbott and Costello split in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |agency= [[United Press International]] |title=Abbott, Costello Split.

Abbott then planned to team up with [[Eddie Foy Jr.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |agency= [[United Press International]] |title=Abbott and Foy Team. Late Lou Costello's Partner to Work With Comedian |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1959/06/12/archives/abbott-and-foy-team-late-lou-costellos-partner-to-work-with.html |quote= |newspaper=The New York Times |date=June 11, 1959 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later years===
In 1960, Abbott began performing with a new partner, [[Candy Candido]], to good reviews. But Abbott called it quits, remarking that "No one could ever live up to Lou." The following year, Abbott performed in a dramatic television episode of ''[[General Electric Theater]]'' titled "The Joke's on Me". A few years later, Abbott provided his own voice for the [[Hanna-Barbera]] animated series ''[[The Abbott and Costello Cartoon Show]]'', with Stan Irwin providing the voice of Lou Costello.

==Personal life==
[[Image:Bud Abbott's Walk of Fame Star.jpg|thumb|right|Abbott's star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] for his work in television]]
Bud and Betty Abbott were married for 55 years. The couple adopted two children: Bud Jr. in 1942 and Vickie in 1949. Bud Jr. died on January 19, 1997, at the age of 57.

Abbott has three stars on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]: the radio star is located at 6333 [[Hollywood Boulevard]], the [[List of actors with Hollywood Walk of Fame motion picture stars|motion pictures star]] is located at 1611 [[Vine Street]], and the television star is located at 6740 Hollywood Boulevard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hollywood Walk of Fame - Bud Abbott|url=http://www.walkoffame.com/bud-abbott|website=walkoffame.com|publisher=Hollywood Chamber of Commerce|accessdate=November 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Abbott died of cancer at the age of 76 on April 24, 1974, at his home in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=nytobit&gt;{{cite news |author= |title=Bud Abbott, Straight Man To Lou Costello, Is Dead |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/04/25/archives/bud-abbott-straight-man-to-lou-costello-is-dead.html |quote= |newspaper=The New York Times |date=April 25, 1974 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=apobit&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=rY5AAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=3KQMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4590,5423224&amp;dq=bud+abbott+dies&amp;hl=en Bud Abbott dies at 78]&lt;/ref&gt; He was cremated and his ashes scattered in the Pacific Ocean. His wife, Betty, died on September 12, 1981.

When [[Groucho Marx]] was asked about Abbott shortly after his death, his response was that Abbott was "the greatest straight man ever."&lt;ref name="Furmanek 1991"/&gt;

==Honors and awards==
Abbott and Costello are among the few non-baseball personnel to be memorialized in the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]], although they are not inductees of the Hall itself.  A plaque and a gold record of the "Who's On First?" sketch have been on permanent display there since 1956, and the routine runs on an endless video loop in the exhibit area.&lt;ref&gt;Dunning, J. ''On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio''. Oxford Univ. Press (1998), pp. 2-3. {{ISBN|0-19-507678-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abbott and Costello each have three stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for their work in radio, television and motion pictures.

In 1942 they were voted the country's No. 1 Box Office Stars by exhibitors.

Abbott received the Lifetime Achievement Award for Acting (posthumously) from the Garden State Film Festival in 2006; it was accepted on his behalf by his daughter Vickie Abbott Wheeler.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}
