}}
'''Sir Harry Donald Secombe''', [[Commander of the British Empire|CBE]] (8 September 1921 – 11 April 2001) was a [[Welsh people|Welsh]]-born comedian, actor and singer. Secombe was a member of the British [[radio comedy]] programme ''[[The Goon Show]]'' (1951–60), playing many characters, but most notably, [[Neddie Seagoon]]. An accomplished tenor, he also appeared in [[musical theater|musicals]] and films - notably as Mr Bumble in ''[[Oliver! (film)|Oliver!]]'' (1968) -  and, in his later years, was a presenter of television shows incorporating [[hymn]]s and other devotional songs.

==Early life==
Secombe was born in [[St Thomas, Swansea]], the third of four children of Nellie Jane Gladys (née Davies), a shop manageress, and Frederick Ernest Secombe, a grocer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/southwest/halloffame/showbiz/harrysecombe.shtml|title=BBC – Error 404 : Not Found|publisher=}}{{dl|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-73159491.html|title=Sir Harry Secombe: 1921–2001: I Married Him, Christened and Wed His Kids.

His family were regular churchgoers, belonging to the congregation of St Thomas Church. A member of the choir, from the age of 12 Secombe would perform a sketch entitled ''The Welsh Courtship'' at church socials, acting as "feed" to his sister Carol. His elder brother, [[Fred Secombe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1316865/Flowers-and-fond-farewells-for-Sir-Harry.html|title=Flowers and fond farewells for Sir Harry|first=By Richard|last=Alleyne|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the author of several books about his experiences as an Anglican priest and rector.

==British Army==
After leaving school in 1937, Secombe became a pay clerk at Baldwin's store. With war looming, he decided in 1938 that he would join the [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army (United Kingdom)]]. Very [[myopia|short sighted]], he got a friend to tell him the sight test, and then learnt it by heart. He served as a [[Lance Bombardier]] in No.132 Field Regiment of the [[Royal Artillery]].&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1315822/Sir-Harry-Secombe.html|title=Sir Harry Secombe|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He would refer to the unit in which he served during [[World War II]] in the [[North African Campaign]], [[Allied invasion of Sicily|Sicily]], and [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italy]], as "The Five-Mile Snipers".  While in North Africa Secombe met [[Spike Milligan]] for the first time.&lt;ref name="entertainmentscene360.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.entertainmentscene360.com/index.php/biography-harry-secombe-7369/|title=Die Besten Wimpern Tipps – Alles über Styling, Pflegeprodukte und vieles mehr|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Sicily he joined a concert party and developed his own comedy routines to entertain the troops.

When Secombe visited the [[Falkland Islands]] to entertain the troops after the 1982 [[Falklands War]], his old regiment promoted him to the rank of sergeant: 37 years after he had been [[demobilization|demobbed]].&lt;ref name="BBCWales"/&gt;

==As an entertainer==
He made his first radio broadcast in May 1944 on a variety show aimed at the services. Following the end of fighting in the war but prior to demobilisation Secombe joined a pool of entertainers in [[Naples]] and formed a comedy duo with [[Spike Milligan]].&lt;ref name="entertainmentscene360.com"/&gt;

Secombe joined the cast of the [[Windmill Theatre]] in 1946, using a routine he had developed in Italy about how people shaved.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/&gt; Secombe always claimed that his ability to sing could always be counted on to save him when he bombed. Both Milligan and Sellers credited him with keeping the act on the bill when club owners had wanted to sack them.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

After a regional touring career, his first break came in radio when he was chosen as resident comedian for the Welsh series ''[[Welsh Rarebit (radio programme)|Welsh Rarebit]],'' followed by appearances on ''[[Variety Bandbox]]'' and a regular role in ''[[Educating Archie]]''.

Secombe met [[Michael Bentine]] at the Windmill Theatre, and was introduced to [[Peter Sellers]] by his agent [[Jimmy Grafton]]. Together with Spike Milligan, the four wrote a comedy radio script, and ''Those Crazy People'' was commissioned&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/thegoonshow/ "Comedy The Goon Show"], BBC website&lt;/ref&gt; and first broadcast on 28 May 1951. Produced by Peter Ross, this would soon become ''[[The Goon Show]]'' and the show remained on the air until 1960.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/&gt; Secombe mainly played [[Neddie Seagoon]], around whom the show's absurd plots developed.&lt;ref name="BBCWales"/&gt; In 1955, whilst appearing on ''The Goon Show'', Secombe was approached by the BBC to step in at short notice to take the lead in the radio comedy ''[[Hancock's Half Hour]]''.&lt;ref name="BBC Hancock"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/andrew-secombe-cast-in-missing-hancocks|title=Andrew Secombe cast in his father’s role in new episodes of BBC Radio 4’s The Missing Hancocks|publisher=BBC Media Centre|accessdate=29 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The star of the show, [[Tony Hancock]], had decided to take an unannounced break abroad the day before the live airing of the second season. Secombe appeared in the lead for the first three episodes and had a guest role in the fourth after Hancock's return. All four episodes are lost, but following the discovery of the original scripts the episodes were rerecorded in 2017, with [[Andy Secombe|Andrew Secombe]] performing the role held by his then late father.&lt;ref name="BBC Hancock"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC Radio Times"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2017-03-14/how-radio-4-is-bringing-tony-hancock-back-to-life|title=How Radio 4 is bringing Tony Hancock back to life|publisher=Radio Times|first=Stephen|last=Armstrong|accessdate=29 March 2017|date=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the success of ''The Goon Show'', Secombe developed a dual career as both a comedy actor and a singer. At the beginning of his career as an entertainer his act would end with a joke version of the duet ''[[Sweethearts (song)|Sweethearts]],'' in which he sang both the [[baritone]] and [[falsetto]] parts. Trained under Italian [[maestro]] [[Manlio di Veroli]], he emerged as a ''[[bel canto]]'' [[tenor]] (characteristically, he insisted that in his case this meant "can belto") and had a long list of best-selling record albums to his credit.&lt;ref name="BBCWales"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/southwest/halloffame/showbiz/harrysecombe.shtml|title=Sir Harry Secombe|publisher=BBC Wales|accessdate=2 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958 he appeared in the film ''[[Jet Storm]],'' which starred [[Sybil Thorndike|Dame Sybil Thorndike]] and [[Richard Attenborough]]&lt;!-- he wasn't knighted until 1976. --&gt; and in the same year Secombe starred in the title role in ''[[Davy (film)|Davy]]'', one of [[Ealing Studios]]' last films.&lt;ref name="BBCWales"/&gt;

The power of his voice allowed Secombe to appear in many stage [[Musical theater|musicals]]. This included 1963's ''[[Pickwick (musical)|Pickwick]],'' based on [[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[The Pickwick Papers]]'', which gave him the number 18 hit single "[[If I Ruled the World]]" – his later signature tune. In 1965 the show was produced on tour in the United States, where on Broadway he garnered a nomination for a [[Tony Award]] for Best Actor in a Musical.&lt;ref name="BBCWales"/&gt; He also appeared in the musical ''[[The Four Musketeers (musical)|The Four Musketeers]]'' (1967) at Drury Lane,&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/&gt; as Mr. Bumble in [[Carol Reed]]'s film of ''[[Oliver! (film)|Oliver!]]'' (1968), and in the Envy segment of ''[[The Magnificent Seven Deadly Sins]]'' (1971).

He would go on to star in his own television show, ''The Harry Secombe Show'', which debuted on Christmas Day 1968 on [[BBC One|BBC 1]] and ran for thirty-one episodes until 1973. A [[sketch comedy]] show featuring [[Julian Orchard]] as Secombe's regular [[sidekick]], the series also featured guest appearances by fellow Goon Spike Milligan as well as leading performers such as [[Ronnie Barker]] and [[Arthur Lowe]]. Secombe later starred in similar vehicles such as ''Sing a Song of Secombe'' and [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s ''Secombe with Music'' during the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Kibble-White &amp; Steve Williams, ''The Encyclopedia of Classic Saturday Night Telly'', London: 2007, pp 158–9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later career==
Later in life, Secombe (whose brother [[Fred Secombe]] was a priest in the [[Church in Wales]], part of the [[Anglican]] Communion) attracted new audiences as a presenter of religious programmes, such as the [[BBC]]'s ''[[Songs of Praise]]'' and [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s ''[[Stars on Sunday (TV series)|Stars on Sunday]]'' and ''[[Highway (TV series)|Highway]]''. He was also a special programming consultant to [[ITV Wales &amp; West|Harlech Television]].&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,3604,471984,00.html |title=Sir Harry Secombe dies |work=The Guardian |date=11 April 2001 |accessdate=4 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and hosted a [[Thames Television]] programme in 1979 entitled ''Cross on the Donkey's Back''. In the latter half of the 1980s, Secombe personally sponsored a football team for boys aged 9–11 in the local West Sutton Little League, 'Secombes Knights'.

In 1990, he was one of a few to be honoured by a second appearance on ''[[This Is Your Life (UK TV series)|This Is Your Life]]'', when he was surprised by [[Michael Aspel]] at a book signing in a London branch of WH Smith. Secombe had been a subject of the show previously in March 1958 when [[Eamonn Andrews]] surprised him at the BBC Television Theatre.

==Honours==
[[File:Sir Harry Secombe plaque (3412015135).jpg|thumb|A [[blue plaque]] commemorating Secombe.]]
In 1963 he was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE).&lt;ref name="entertainmentscene360.com"/&gt;

He was knighted in 1981,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/apr/11/1|title=Sir Harry Secombe dies|first=|last=Staff and agencies|date=11 April 2001|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and jokingly referred to himself as Sir Cumference (in recognition of his rotund figure). The motto he chose for his [[coat of arms]] was "GO ON", a reference to [[The Goon Show|goon]].

==Later life and death==
Secombe suffered from [[peritonitis]] in 1980. Within two years, taking advice from doctors, he had lost five stone in weight.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Unforgettable]]&lt;/ref&gt; He had a stroke in 1997, from which he made a slow recovery. He was then diagnosed with [[prostate cancer]] in September 1998. After suffering a second stroke in 1999, he was forced to abandon his television career, but made a documentary about his condition in the hope of giving encouragement to other sufferers.&lt;ref name="TVHeaven"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.televisionheaven.co.uk/hissecombe.htm| title=Television Heaven: Harry Secombe| accessdate=12 February 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20051118201531/http://www.televisionheaven.co.uk/hissecombe.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 18 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secombe had [[diabetes]] in the latter part of his life.

Secombe died on 11 April 2001 at the age of 79, from prostate cancer, in hospital in [[Guildford]], Surrey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1315879/Goon-star-Sir-Harry-Secombe-dies-aged-79.html|title=Goon star Sir Harry Secombe dies aged 79|author=Thomas Penny|date=12 April 2001|work=Telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; His ashes are interred at the parish church of [[Shamley Green]], and a later [[funeral|memorial service]] to celebrate his life was held at [[Westminster Abbey]] on 26 October 2001. As well as family members and friends, the service was also attended by [[Charles, Prince of Wales]] and representatives of [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]], [[Anne, Princess Royal]], [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon]] and [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent]]. On his tombstone is the inscription: "To know him was to love him."

Upon hearing of his old friend's death, [[Spike Milligan]] quipped, "I'm glad he died before me, because I didn't want him to sing at my funeral." But Secombe would have the last laugh: upon Milligan's own death the following year, a recording of Secombe singing was played at Spike's memorial service.

The [[Secombe Theatre]] at [[Sutton, London]], bears his name in memory of this former local personality. He is also fondly remembered at the [[London Welsh Centre]], where he opened the bar on St Patrick's Day (17 March) 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.londonwelsh.org/about-us/history-of-the-centre |title=History: London Welsh Centre |publisher=[[London Welsh Centre]] |year=2009|accessdate=4 February 2011|work=[[London Welsh Centre]] website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Secombe met Myra Joan Atherton at the Mumbles Dance hall in 1946.  The couple were married from 1948 until his death, and had four children:
*Jennifer Secombe, widow of actor [[Alex Giannini]]. She was also her father's agent in his later years.
*[[Andy Secombe]], a [[voice actor]], film actor and author
*David Secombe, a writer and photographer
*Katy Secombe, an actress
