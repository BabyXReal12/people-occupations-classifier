'''Alexandrea Borstein''' (born February 15, 1971)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alexborstein.com/main.htm|title=FAQ (first question)|work=Alexborstein.com|accessdate=July 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an American actress, writer, producer, and comedian. She is best known for voicing the role of [[Lois Griffin]] on the animated comedy series ''[[Family Guy]]'' (1999–present), for which she has been nominated for multiple [[Primetime Emmy Awards]]. 

She also had lead roles as various characters on the sketch comedy series ''[[MADtv]]'' (1997–2009), Dawn Forchette in the medical comedy series [[Getting On (U.S. TV series)|''Getting On'']] (2013–15), and Susie Myerson in the historical comedy-drama series ''[[The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel]]'' (2017–present), the latter of which earned her a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series|Primetime Emmy Award]] nomination. Borstein has held supporting roles in numerous films, including ''[[The Lizzie McGuire Movie]]'' (2003), ''[[Catwoman (film)|Catwoman]]'' (2004), ''[[Good Night, and Good Luck]]'' (2005), ''[[Ted (film)|Ted]]'' (2012), ''[[ParaNorman]]'' (2012), and ''[[A Million Ways to Die in the West]]'' (2014). 

A native of [[Deerfield, Illinois]], Borstein is a graduate of [[San Francisco State University]], where she studied [[rhetoric]]. She was trained in [[Improvisation|improvisational comedy]] at the [[ACME Comedy Theatre]], near [[Hollywood]], [[California]], and was selected to join ''MADtv'' after being scouted by [[talent agent]]s who noticed her work at the theatre. She was a writer and voice actor for several television shows, including ''[[Casper the Friendly Ghost|Casper]]'', ''[[Pinky and the Brain]]'', and ''[[Power Rangers: Zeo]]'', before joining the cast of ''MADtv'' in 1997 as a featured player, becoming a repertory player mid-season.

==Early life==
Borstein was born in [[Highland Park, Illinois]], a suburb north of the city of [[Chicago]], in 1973 (according to her own official website), though some sources still say 1971. She was raised in [[Deerfield, Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forward.com/the-assimilator/189943/alex-borstein-on-family-guy-and-getting-on/|title=Alex Borstein on 'Family Guy' and 'Getting On'|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Borstein has two elder brothers. Her parents, Irv and Judy Borstein, are both mental health professionals.&lt;ref name="alex1"&gt;{{cite web| last =Phipps| first =Keith| authorlink =| coauthors =| title=Random Rules: Alex Borstein| publisher =The A.V.

Her father is from Atlanta, Georgia. Her mother, a [[Sh'erit ha-Pletah|Holocaust survivor]], was born and raised in [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]], and moved to the United States after the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hemaware.org/story/hemophilia-humor|title=Hemophilia Humor|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://jewishjournal.com/culture/just-asking/228674/alex-borstein-and-her-maisel-character-were-both-like-little-bulldogs/&lt;/ref&gt; Borstein attended [[San Francisco State University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/ct-alex-borstein-getting-on-hbo-20141112-story,amp.html|title=Alex Borstein, a woman of many voices with just the right tone|publisher=[[Chicago Tribune]]|author=Courtney Crowder|date=November 12, 2014|accessdate=May 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===1993–1998: Career beginnings and ''MADtv''===
Borstein trained in improv at the [[ACME Comedy Theater]], where she met her writing partner and future husband [[Jackson Douglas]]. Shortly after they began working together on the [[list of animated television series|animated series]] ''[[Casper the Friendly Ghost|Casper]]'' and ''[[Pinky and the Brain]]'', Borstein left her position at an ad agency – where she had written print ads for [[Barbie]] – to become a full-time writer. In 1996, while still writing for ''Casper'', Borstein worked on the show ''[[Power Rangers Zeo]]'' as the voice of [[Queen Machina]], the queen of the [[Machine Empire]].

In 1997, Borstein became a cast member on the third season of the sketch comedy show ''[[MADtv]]''. She originally joined the cast as a featured player, but was upgraded to the repertory mid-season.

Borstein was best known on ''MADtv'' for her character Ms. Swan; her other recurring characters included Eracist Anne, "Stick Chick" Echo, singer Jasmine Wayne-Wayne, child prodigy Karen Goddard, lounge singer Shaunda, ''News at Six'' outside-the-studio reporter Sue Napersville, and Cordo the [[Gap (clothing retailer)|GAP]] troll. When [[Seth Green]] made recurring appearances on the show as mean boss Mr. Brightling, Borstein would play his mother, Mama Brightling.

===1999–2009: Further success and ''Family Guy''===
[[File:Alex Borstein by Gage Skidmore 3.jpg|thumb|Borstein at the 2010 [[San Diego Comic-Con]]]]
While working on ''MADtv'', Borstein met [[Seth MacFarlane]], who was then preparing to launch the animated sitcom ''[[Family Guy]]'' on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]]. MacFarlane was originally supposed to create animated shorts for ''MADtv'', but declined in favor of creating an independent series. MacFarlane cast Borstein as the voice of character [[Lois Griffin]]. After the show's debut in January 1999, ''Family Guy'' was cancelled by the network in 2002, but returned in 2005. As well as her role as the voice performer for Lois and several other characters (including a brief appearance as Ms. Swan in a 2005 episode), she is also a [[Television producer|producer]] and staff writer. She was nominated for a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance]] for the episode "[[Lois Comes Out of Her Shell]]" in 2013.

In 2000, Borstein was cast as [[Sookie St. James]] in the [[The WB Television Network|WB]] drama ''[[Gilmore Girls]]''. She portrayed Sookie in the pilot, but her ''MADtv'' contract prevented her from continuing in the role, which was recast with [[Melissa McCarthy]]. Borstein made recurring appearances on ''Gilmore Girls'' throughout the show's run, first as the [[harp]]ist Drella and later as the stylist Miss Celine.

As a film actress, she played the [[school principal]] in ''[[The Lizzie McGuire Movie]]'' (2003), the best friend of [[Halle Berry]]'s character in ''[[Catwoman (film)|Catwoman]]'' (2004), and an employee at [[CBS News]] in ''[[Good Night, and Good Luck]]'' (2005). She also had a small role in the movie ''[[Bad Santa]]'' (2003) and an uncredited cameo as an obnoxious coffee shop patron in the [[Will Ferrell]] movie ''[[Kicking &amp; Screaming (2005 film)|Kicking &amp; Screaming]]'' (2005).  On some commercials, she sometimes voices [[Olive Oyl]] from [[Popeye]] and [[Betty Boop]]. 

Borstein was a co-host of [[Game Show Network|GSN's]] ''[[Celebrity Blackjack]]'' in 2004. She made at least three guest appearances, once as Lois Griffin, on the [[Comedy Central]] animated program ''[[Drawn Together]]''.

Borstein was cast as a [[press secretary]] in the 2007 sitcom pilot ''[[The Thick of It (U.S. Series)|The Thick of It]]'', but the series was not picked up for broadcast. She was seen in the 2009 comedy ''[[For Christ's Sake]]'',  which was directed by her real-life husband Jackson Douglas.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1067107/ For Christ's Sake (2010)]. IMDb.com&lt;/ref&gt; 

Borstein's production company is called Crackerpants, Inc. In 2007, they released the DVD ''Drop Dead Gorgeous (in a Down-to-Earth Bombshell Sort of Way)'', a recording of a live performance at the [[Alex Theatre]], with opening act Teddy Towne. The title comes from one of many actual female [[Casting (performing arts)|character breakdowns]] Borstein reads from to illustrate sexism in the industry.&lt;ref&gt;''Drop Dead Gorgeous (In a Down to Earth Bombshell Sort of Way)'', Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010–present: ''Getting On'' and ''The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel''===
[[File:Alex Borstein (7601663822).jpg|thumb|San Diego Comic-Con|Borstein at the 2012 [[San Diego Comic-Con]]]]
Borstein has made several supporting appearances in such comedic films as ''[[Killers (2010 film)|Killers]]'' (2010), ''[[Dinner for Schmucks]]'' (2010), ''[[Ted (film)|Ted]]'' (2012), ''[[ParaNorman]]'' (2012), ''[[A Million Ways to Die in the West]]'' (2014), and ''[[The Angry Birds Movie]]'' (2016).

In 2010, Borstein joined the first season staff of the [[Showtime (TV channel)|Showtime]] [[comedy-drama]] series ''[[Shameless (U.S. TV series)|Shameless]]'', as a writer and supervising producer. In its second season, she held the position of writer and consulting producer. She also guest starred as Lou Deckner in numerous episodes of the series, beginning in the first season episode "But at Last Came a Knock".

She also appeared as a comedian contestant on [[IFC (U.S. TV channel)|IFC]]'s short-lived comedy-driven game show ''[[Bunk (TV Series)|Bunk]]'' in 2012.

Borstein later starred as Dawn Forchette on the [[HBO]] comedy series [[Getting On (U.S. TV series)|Getting On]], which is a remake of a [[Getting On (UK TV series)|UK series of the same name]]. The series has gained positive reviews and earned multiple [[Primetime Emmy Award]] nominations. It aired from 2013 to 2015. 

Beginning in 2017, Borstein starred as Susie Myerson in the historical comedy-drama series ''[[The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel]]'', for which she received significant critical acclaim and a nomination for the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series]].

==Personal life==
Borstein is divorced from actor and writer Jackson Douglas,&lt;ref&gt;http://people.com/tv/family-guy-star-alex-borstein-finalizes-divorce-jackson-douglas/&lt;/ref&gt; whom she met while studying [[Improvisational theatre|improv]] at the [[ACME Comedy Theatre]]. Douglas proposed to her during the taping of a ''MADtv'' skit; the couple married in 1999. Douglas filed for divorce in October 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tmz.com/2014/10/30/alex-borstein-divorce-family-guy-lois-griffin-husband-split/|title='Family Guy' Star Alex Borstein -- Husband Files For Divorce ... I Want Pewterschmidt Money|publisher=|accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the DVD commentary for the ''Family Guy'' episode "[[Stewie Kills Lois]]" – at the time she was pregnant – she joked about the possibility of naming her baby [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]]. They have a son named Barnaby Borstein Douglas (born September 8, 2008)&lt;ref&gt;http://celebritybabies.people.com/2008/09/09/alex-borstein-a/&lt;/ref&gt; and a daughter named Henrietta Borstein Douglas (born October 1, 2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.celebritybabyscoop.com/2012/10/08/alex-borstein-welcomes-baby-no-2-henrietta|work=Celebrity Baby Scoop|accessdate=April 23, 2014|title=Alex Borstein Welcomes Baby No. 2: Henrietta|date=October 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
