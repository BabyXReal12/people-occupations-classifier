'''Jasper Carrott''', [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] (born '''Robert Norman Davis'''; 14 March 1945) is an English comedian, actor, television presenter, and personality.

==Early life==
Born in Shaftmoor Lane, [[Acocks Green]], in [[Birmingham]], Carrott was educated at Acocks Green primary school and [[Moseley School]]. He worked as a trainee buyer at a city centre department store, the Beehive, with schoolmate [[Bev Bevan]].

==Career==

{{BLP sources section|date=April 2016}}
In February 1969 he started his own folk club, "The Boggery", in nearby [[Solihull]] with his friend Les Ward. Carrott performed folk songs and as an [[MC]]. His banter overtook the songs and he became more a comedian than singer. He also worked as a musical agent (with John Starkey, who was his manager from 1974 to 1992), as Fingimigig, managing among others [[Harvey Andrews]]. He toured UK rugby clubs. He recorded an album in 1973 called ''Jasper Carrot – In the Club'', which he sold from his van. The album contained the original "Magic Roundabout", although mainly material used in his next three LPs (such as "Hare Krishna", "Car Insurance", "Bastity Chelt", and "Hava Nagila") plus the [[Fred Wedlock]] song "The Folker".

He had a UK Top 5 chart hit in August 1975 with the novelty record "[[Funky Moped]]", written by [[Chris Rohmann]] and produced by [[Jeff Lynne]].

By the late 1970s, Carrott had developed anecdotal sketches which he still performs 30 years on. Often they purport to be autobiographical; many celebrate the Birmingham accent and culture, including his support of [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]].

His live performances were recorded as ''Jasper Carrott Rabbitts on and on and on...'' and ''Carrott in Notts''. Notable hits were "Bastity Chelt", a song in [[Spoonerism]], "The Football Match" describing a visit to [[Old Trafford (football ground)|Old Trafford]], "The Nutter on the Bus" (including the cry ''"Has anybody seen my camel?"''), "The Mole" (''"There's only one way to get rid of a mole – blow its bloody head off!"'') and "Zits" – an explanation of American slang for spots that brought the word into use in Britain.

[[File:Birmingham Walk of Stars Jasper Carrott.jpg|right|thumb|[[Birmingham Walk of Stars]]]]
In 1979 he published ''A Little Zit on the Side'', a humorous autobiography. The follow-up, ''Sweet and Sour Labrador'', mixed sections of stand-up routines with similar autobiographical material, much of it related to his world travels. Carrott was once a compère for the [[Birmingham Heart Beat Charity Concert 1986]], which featured local bands such as [[Electric Light Orchestra]] and the [[Moody Blues]], with a finale that included [[George Harrison]] from [[the Beatles]]. On 15 September 2007 he was inducted into the [[Birmingham Walk of Stars]] at the Arts Fest 2007 celebrations. The award was presented by the [[Lord Mayor]] of Birmingham. Carrott is the second inductee, following [[Ozzy Osbourne]]. Carrott was awarded the [[Lifetime Achievement Award]] by the [[British Comedy Awards]] on 6 December 2008.

His first appearance on television was a half-hour show for BBC Midlands on 11 August 1975 in a programme about local football called "The Golden Game". Then in 1976, ''A Half Hour Mislaid with Jasper Carrott'' recorded at [[Pebble Mill]]. His break came two years later when [[Michael Grade]] asked for a pilot for [[London Weekend Television|LWT]]. Grade liked it and five further shows were recorded, which became his first TV series, ''[[An Audience with...|An Audience with Jasper Carrott]]'', in 1978,&lt;ref&gt;Ed Doolan interviews...Jasper Carrott (a.k.a.The Other Side of Jasper Carrott) (2005) Radio BBC7&lt;/ref&gt; this partnership with LWT lasted until 1981, ''The Unrecorded Jasper Carrott'' (1979) and ''Beat the Carrott'' (1981) are the best known live stand-up performances from his time with LWT. Carrott often appeared alongside comedy legend Sammy 'Shinpads' Higgins during his rise to fame.

He moved to the BBC for ''[[Carrott's Lib]]'', a Saturday night comedy broadcast [[Live television|live]], and then a string of BBC shows. The most notable were ''[[Commercial Breakdown|Carrott's Commercial Breakdown]]'', which broadcast weird [[advert]]s from around the world, and the sketch and stand-up shows ''[[Carrott Confidential]]'', ''24 Carrott Gold'', ''The Trial of Jasper Carrott'' and ''[[Canned Carrott]]'', some of which also featured [[Steve Punt]] and [[Hugh Dennis]].

Carrott played Heinrich in the 1987 British comedy film, ''[[Jane and the Lost City]]''.&lt;ref name="Official"&gt;{{cite web|title=Biography|work=Jasper Carrott: The Official Website|url=http://www.jaspercarrott.com/biography.asp?SiteID=JAS&amp;M=4&amp;PageID=20&amp;CatType=biog|accessdate=15 November 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713091037/http://www.jaspercarrott.com/biography.asp?SiteID=JAS&amp;M=4&amp;PageID=20&amp;CatType=biog|archivedate=13 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Canned Carrott'' also featured a [[Parody|spoof]] police drama called ''[[The Detectives]]'', co-starring [[Robert Powell]], which turned into a series. In 2002–04, he starred in the sitcom ''[[All About Me]]''. He performed in several of the ''[[The Secret Policeman's Balls|Secret Policeman's Ball]]'' charity concerts for [[Amnesty International]], and returned to the stage in 2004 at the [[National Indoor Arena]] in Birmingham featuring classic routines from his career. He returned to singing for the musical ''Go Play Up Your Own End'' (written by [[Malcolm Stent]], songs by [[Harvey Andrews]]) in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/birmingham/content/articles/2005/05/25/go_play_review_feature.shtml|title=Go Play Up Your Own End|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, he appeared in and put on the first of ''Jasper Carrott's Rock With Laughter'' concerts. He appeared alongside [[Bill Bailey]], [[Bonnie Tyler]], [[Lenny Henry]], [[Bobby Davro]], the [[Lord of the Dance (musical)|Lord of the Dance]] troupe and [[Bev Bevan]]. {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} This became a regular at the NEC in Birmingham, usually in December and sometimes alternating with his "Jasper Carrott's Christmas Crackers" events, but there have also been a few summer shows too.

In summer 2007, Carrott hosted the [[Endemol]]-produced game show ''[[Golden Balls]]'' for [[ITV1]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goldenballstvshow.com/about.html|title=About – Golden Balls TV Show|work=goldenballstvshow.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141104044816/http://www.goldenballstvshow.com/about.html|archivedate=4 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Promising ratings led to a second series in January 2008. Carrott would often refer to the golden balls as his own testicles which added to the humour of the show. A third series began in April 2008, and a fourth in October 2008. A fifth and six series were shown in 2009. He hosted the Sunday night national pub quiz, ''Cash Inn''. He was 20th in [[Channel 4]]'s 100 Greatest Stand-Up Comedians show.

Since then his work is noted under 'Filmography' below.

==Literary work==
Carrott has written three humorous and sexual autobiographical paperbacks: ''A Little Zit on the Side'' (1979), ''Sweet and Sour Labrador'' (1982) and ''An Orange Carrott In A 'Not So Underage After All' Hole'' (1986). He also wrote a novel called ''Shop! or a Store is Born''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|9780099617006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also of interest is a book by Carrott's former manager John Starkey, ''Jasper and Me'' (1993; Etsiketsi Books).
He once said,  "Ringo isn't the best drummer in the world. He isn't even the best drummer in the Beatles." This quote was credited to John Lennon until Mark Lewisohn discovered in 1983 that it was Mr Carrott who said it.&lt;ref&gt;     According to Daniel Finkelstein, writing in The Times in 2014,                   &lt;/ref&gt;

==Business interests==
Carrott was part-owner of the production company [[Celador]], makers of ''[[Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?]]'' In 2006, he and wife Hazel sold their shares for £10m as part of a [[management buyout]].

==Personal life==
Carrott has been married to his wife Hazel (''née'' Jackson), a former local journalist, since 1973.{{fact|date=February 2017}}&lt;!-- infobox says 73 --&gt; They have three daughters and one son: actress [[Lucy Davis]], Hannah, Jenny, and Jake.

Carrott is a supporter, and was a director, of [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]]. He was awarded an [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] in 2002 "for charitable services".&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=56797 |supp=y |page=10 |date=31 December 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[University of Birmingham]] awarded him an honorary doctorate in 2004,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/west_midlands/3772191.stm |publisher=BBC News  | title=Comic to get honorary doctorate | date=3 June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; following a similar award from [[Aston University]] in 1995.

Carrott lives in [[Dorridge]], near Solihull. He was a runner and supported Knowle Fun Run through sponsorship and publicity, in 2001 donating thousands of pounds, £10 for each person who beat him.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} He is also a patron and fundraiser for [[Sunfield Children's Home]], a school for children with [[autism]]. The school is in [[Clent]].

On 2 April 2018, Carrott had a heart bypass operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/5958163/jasper-carrott-tour-2018-triple-heart-bypass/|title=Jasper Carrott confirms he's going back on tour after having quadruple heart bypass|date=2 April 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
