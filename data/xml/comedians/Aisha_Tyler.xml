Tyler's career in television took off in 2001 with jobs as the host of ''[[Talk Soup]]'' and the reality-dating series ''[[The Fifth Wheel]]'', although ''Talk Soup'' was canceled the following year and Tyler left ''The Fifth Wheel'' in 2002 to pursue other interests. Tyler has devoted a significant amount of her time to independent projects, including a role in the play ''Moose Mating'', for which she received an [[NAACP Image Award]]. She also wrote, directed, and starred in the independent short film ''The Whipper''. Moving into acting, Tyler featured in ''[[Friends]]'' as Dr. Charlie Wheeler, [[Joey Tribbiani|Joey]]'s and then [[Ross Geller|Ross]]' girlfriend, in the ninth and tenth seasons. She followed this up with guest spots on ''[[CSI: Miami]]'' and ''[[Nip/Tuck]]'', as well as balancing season-long recurring roles on both ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation]]'' and ''[[24 (television)|24]]'' during the 2004–2005 television season. She also filmed her own sitcom pilot for CBS, which was not picked up. She has guest-starred on ''[[MADtv]]''.

Following her regular role on the CBS series ''[[Ghost Whisperer]]'' during its first season, Tyler appeared in several films, including ''[[The Santa Clause 2]]'', ''[[The Santa Clause 3: The Escape Clause]]'', ''[[.45 (film)|.45]]'', and the comedy ''[[Balls of Fury]]''.

Tyler has moved into print media as a regular contributor to ''[[Glamour (magazine)|Glamour]]'', ''[[Jane (magazine)|Jane]]'', and ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' magazines. Her first book, ''Swerve: A Guide to the Sweet Life for Postmodern Girls'', was released in January 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tyler|first=Aisha|title=Swerve: A Guide to the Sweet Life for Postmodern Girls|location=New York|publisher=Plume|year=2004|isbn=0-525-94806-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tyler plays on the ''[[World Poker Tour]]'' in the Hollywood Home games for the [[Futures Without Violence]] charity.

Philanthropy and charity work are very important to Tyler, and she regularly does volunteer work for the [[American Red Cross]], [[The Trust for Public Land]], [[Planned Parenthood Federation of America]], and the [[International Rescue Committee]].

Tyler appeared in a nude pictorial, along with other celebrities, in the May 2006 issue of ''[[Allure (magazine)|Allure]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Stars Line Up For Naked Spread |url=http://www.contactmusic.com/carla-gugino/news/stars-line-up-for-naked-spread_1028957 |publisher=Contactmusic.com |date=April 24, 2007 |access-date=July 29, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080731202413/http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/article/stars%20line%20up%20for%20naked%20spread_1028957 |archive-date=July 31, 2008 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The annual Nude Issue raises money to combat [[skin cancer]].

In May 2009, it was announced that ABC had given Tyler her own talk show pilot, ''The Aisha Tyler Show''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.tvguide.com/News/Aisha-Tyler-Talk-1005895.aspx|title = Aisha Tyler Nabs Talk Show Pilot|publisher = TVGuide.com|accessdate = May 8, 2009|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090520111614/http://www.tvguide.com/News/Aisha-Tyler-Talk-1005895.aspx|archivedate = May 20, 2009|deadurl = no|date = May 8, 2009|last = Joyce Eng}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early May 2010, she presented the "Welcome to the Beta" video for ''[[Halo: Reach]]''.

The segment is named "Tuesdays With Tyler".&lt;ref&gt;stephaniemiller.com&lt;/ref&gt; Tyler appears either in-studio or via phone when she is not otherwise committed to one of her acting roles. While [[Hal Sparks]] was out of the country, Tyler filled in as the third member of the Stephanie Miller Sexy Liberal Comedy Tour on three shows in August 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.sexyliberal.com/2011/06/08/detroit-mi-082011-detroit-opera-house-sexy-liberal-show-with-stephanie-miller-john-fuglesang-and-aisha-tyler|title = Stephanie Miller Sexy Liberal Comedy Tour|date = June 8, 2011|accessdate = September 21, 2015|website = sexyliberal.com|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110627004724/http://www.sexyliberal.com/2011/06/08/detroit-mi-082011-detroit-opera-house-sexy-liberal-show-with-stephanie-miller-john-fuglesang-and-aisha-tyler/|archivedate = June 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2009, Tyler performed her stand-up comedy routine, live at the [[Fillmore Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;https://m.imdb.com/title/tt1361808/&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting on July 26, 2011, Tyler started her own weekly podcast, ''[[Girl on Guy]]'', where she interviews her favorite celebrity friends and discusses topics guys love. ''Girl on Guy'' is available on her website for download using [[iTunes]], mp3, and [[RSS]]. The show launched as the No. 4 comedy podcast on [[iTunes]] and currently is the No. 2 comedy podcast, and the No. 7 overall podcast on iTunes. The first weekly installment of ''Girl on Guy'' featured guest [[H. Jon Benjamin]], the second featured the host of [[Current TV]]'s former show ''[[InfoMania]]'' [[Brett Erlich]] on August 1, 2011, and the third featured ''Archer'' creator [[Adam Reed]] on August 9, 2011.

In October 2011, it was announced that Tyler would join the cast of ''[[The Talk (U.S. TV series)|The Talk]]'' as a permanent co-host, replacing [[Holly Robinson Peete]]. Her first full week as a co-host was October 24 through October 28, 2011.&lt;ref name="eonline1"/&gt; Tyler is known for being expressive and outspoken on The Talk, especially about [[African American]] culture and stereotypes, [[LGBT]] rights, and [[women's rights]]. Tyler presented [[Ubisoft]]'s press conference at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]] [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2012|2012]] in June, which received some backlash from fans who didn't believe Tyler was a gamer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Aisha Tyler Rants "I've Been a Gamer Since Before You Could Read."|url = http://kotaku.com/5918084/aisha-tyler-rants-ive-been-a-gamer-since-before-you-could-read|accessdate = September 19, 2013|newspaper = kotaku.com|date = June 13, 2012|last = Evan Narcisse}}&lt;/ref&gt; This caused Tyler to respond with a poem about how she has been playing video games "since you were a twinge in the left side of your daddy's underoos".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Dear Gamers:|url = https://www.facebook.com/notes/aisha-tyler/dear-gamers/10151040991508993|work = facebook.com|accessdate = 19 September 2013|date = June 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She returned to host the publisher's press conference [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2013|the following year]]. Tyler's second book, ''Self-Inflicted Wounds: Heartwarming Tales of Epic Humiliation'', debuted in July 2013, later becoming a ''[[The New York Times Bestseller List|New York Times]]'' bestseller; it was inspired by questions asked of guests on ''Girl on Guy''.

In March 2013, Tyler was confirmed to be the new host of the American version of ''[[Whose Line Is It Anyway? (U.S. TV series)|Whose Line Is It Anyway?]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = His line: Improv master Ryan Stiles returns to the PAC|url = http://www.wenatcheeworld.com/news/2013/feb/28/his-line-improv-master-ryan-stiles-returns-to-the/|accessdate = September 19, 2013|newspaper = wenatcheeworld.com|date = February 28, 2013|last = Rachel Hansen}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also appears briefly as herself in the video game ''[[Watch Dogs]]'' and is featured in the music video for the [["Weird Al" Yankovic]] song "[[Tacky (song)|Tacky]]". Tyler was also the original voice for the character [[List of characters in the BioShock series#Daisy Fitzroy|Daisy Fitzroy]] in the 2013 video game ''[[BioShock Infinite]]'', but her recordings were not used&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite tweet |user=aishatyler |number=324534447804399617 |date = 17 April 2013 |title=@Vinci_022 you're right!

She was nominated for Personality of 2014 in [[Golden Joystick Award|Golden Joystick Award 2014]].

In June 2015, it was announced that Tyler landed a recurring role on the eleventh season of ''[[Criminal Minds]]''. Although she served as a temporary replacement for [[Jennifer Love Hewitt]], who was on maternity leave,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.inquisitr.com/2193773/criminal-minds-season-11-aisha-tyler-recurring-as-best-replacement-for-kate/|title = 'Criminal Minds' Season 11: Aisha Tyler will recur as Hotch looks to replace Kate|date = June 22, 2015|accessdate = September 21, 2015|website = inquisitr.com|last = Meredith Jacobs}}&lt;/ref&gt; her status was elevated to main cast member in season 12.

In 2016, Tyler started a [[Kickstarter]] campaign to fund her directorial feature film debut, ''[[Axis (film)|Axis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://variety.com/2016/film/news/aisha-tyler-directing-debut-kickstarter-axis-1201752057/ "Aisha Tyler to make feature directing debut on Kiickstarter-funded Axis."] "Variety", Retrieved January 16, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The film was shot over seven days in May 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/d3wq7k/axis-director-aisha-tyler-is-proving-hollywood-doesnt-know-its-audience | title = 'Axis' Director Aisha Tyler Is Proving Hollywood Doesn't Know Its Audience | date = 6 March 2018 | accessdate = 24 April 2018 | publisher = ''VICE'' | author = Candice Frederick }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://deadline.com/2018/01/aisha-tyler-axis-sundance-video-interview-1202266730/ | title = Aisha Tyler Shot 65 Pages A Day For Ambitious Directorial Debut, ‘Axis’ — Sundance Studio | date = 25 January 2018 | accessdate = 24 April 2018 | publisher = ''Deadline'' | author = Matt Grobar }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Axis'' was released via [[video-on-demand]] on April 10, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.talkhouse.com/aisha-tylers-guide-to-recovering-from-disaster/|title=Aisha Tyler’s Guide to Recovering From Disaster|last=Tyler|first=Aisha|work="Talkhouse"|date=April 10, 2018|accessdate=April 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
