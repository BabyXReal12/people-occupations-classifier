[[File:Carol Leifer headshot.jpg|thumb|Carol Leifer]]

Leifer is a [[stand-up comedian]], writer, [[Television producer|producer]] and actor.

She performed stand-up comedy on ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'' 25 times. Leifer also appeared on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'', ''[[Dr. Katz]]'', ''[[Politically Incorrect]]'', ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'', ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'', and ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]''. Her stand-up experience also includes opening for [[Jerry Seinfeld]] and [[Frank Sinatra]]. Sinatra praised Leifer as "one funny broad!" and "I wish my mother had been that funny – I wouldn't have had to work so hard."&lt;ref name="JWMSW"/&gt;

In 1988, she had her own special on [[Cinemax]] titled ''Carol Doesn't Leifer Anymore'', which was produced by [[David Letterman]]. This was shortly followed by the specials ''Carol Leifer Comedy Cruise'' (1989) and ''Really Big Shoo!'' (1990). She wrote and starred in the 1992 [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] TV film ''Gaudy, Bawdy &amp; Blue'', a [[mockumentary]] about fictional aged comedienne Rusty Berman (played by Leifer), told through interviews and flashbacks; the film had a similar concept to the film ''[[Mr. Saturday Night]]'', which had come out several months earlier.

Lefier was a writer on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' during the 1985/1986 season. She has also been involved in television shows including ''Seinfeld'', ''[[It's Like, You Know...]]'' and ''[[The Larry Sanders Show]]''. She has written for the [[Academy Awards]] for most of the 21st century. 

Her hosting duties have included episodes of [[A&amp;E Network|A&amp;E]]'s ''[[Caroline's Comedy Hour]]'' (1989-1993), ''[[Talk Soup]]'' and ''[[Later (talk show)|Later]]''.

Leifer starred in, created and executive-produced the 1997 WB sitcom ''[[Alright Already (TV series)|Alright Already]]'', called one of the "10 Best New Shows of the New Season" by the ''Los Angeles Times'' and ''The Washington Post''. Despite good reviews, the show only ran one season. With [[Mitchell Hurwitz]], Leifer created the short-lived ''[[The Ellen Show]]'' (2001). She was a writer and co-executive producer on the 2007-13 CBS sitcom ''[[Rules of Engagement (TV series)|Rules of Engagement]]''. 

On September 14, 2007, Leifer won an auction for the handwritten notes used by [[Michael Vick]] during his apology for his role in dogfighting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3020177 "TV producer pays $10,200 for notes from Vick's apology"]. [[ESPN]]. September 14, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leifer joined the ''[[Seinfeld]]'' writing staff during its fifth season (1993–94), and wrote six episodes for the show between then and its seventh season (1995–96). She has been dubbed "the real Elaine", as the series' character, [[Elaine Benes]], was partially based on her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/07/tv/touching-moments-with-leifer-get-real.html|title=Touching moments with Leifer?

==Personal life==
From 1981 to 1987, Leifer was married to comic Ritch Shydner, whose [[gentile]] status troubled Leifer's father.&lt;ref name=NewYorkTimes/&gt;

In 1996, Leifer met Lori Wolf, a Jewish real estate executive, when they shared a table at a Project Angel Food charity dinner in Los Angeles. Although Leifer had identified as heterosexual up until then, she later contacted Wolf through the host of their table, though Wolf initially rebuffed Leifer's overtures because Wolf was in a relationship at the time. Wolf contacted Leifer weeks later, after Wolf had ended her relationship, and began one with Leifer. They moved in together in 2005, and in acclimating herself to Wolf's pets, Leifer became an animal rights activist. It was for this reason that she chose [[North Shore Animal League]] as her charity when she appeared in ''[[The Celebrity Apprentice]]''.&lt;ref name=NewYorkTimes/&gt; In 2006 they purchased a $3.2-million, {{convert|5000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} home in the Santa Monica Hills,&lt;ref name=LATimes&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/jul/30/realestate/re-hotprop30 | work=The Los Angeles Times | title=Stand-up adds a new home, baby to routine | first=Ruth | last=Ryon | date=2006-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of their preparations to adopt their nine-month-old son, Bruno Leifer-Wolf, who was born in Guatemala in 2007.&lt;ref name=NewYorkTimes/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117960931.html?categoryid=26&amp;cs=1 | work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | title=Bruno Leifer-Wolf | date=2007-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year, Leifer proposed to Wolf over dinner at the Palm Restaurant in Beverly Hills. On December 5, 2015, they were married by Rabbi Ron Stern at the Brentwood Country Club in Los Angeles. In attendance were [[Jane Lynch]], [[Larry David]], [[Bill Maher]], [[Garry Shandling]], [[Henry Winkler]], [[Larry Miller (comedian)|Larry Miller]], [[Jay Leno]] and [[Paul Reiser]].&lt;ref name=NewYorkTimes/&gt;

Leifer has become [[vegan]], saying "I recently became vegan because I felt that as a Jewish lesbian, I wasn’t part of a small enough minority. So now I’m a Jewish lesbian vegan."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bennett, Karin|url=http://blog.peta.org/archives/2009/07/confessions_of.php |title=Confessions of a Jewish *** Vegan|publisher=[[PETA]]|date=July 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vegetarianstar.com/2009/07/09/carol-leifer-gets-weirder-now-jewish-lesbian-and-vegan/ |title=Carol Leifer Gets Weirder: Now Jewish, Lesbian, AND Vegan |publisher=Vegetarian Star|date=July 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.howardstern.com/rundown.hs?d=1240891200 |title=Carol leifer: a vegan and a lesbian|publisher=The Howard Stern Show|date=2009-04-28 |accessdate=2011-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
