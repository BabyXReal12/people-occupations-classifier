'''Isaiah Edwin Leopold''' (November 9, 1886 – June 19, 1966), better known as '''Ed Wynn''', was an American actor and comedian noted for his ''Perfect Fool'' comedy character, his pioneering radio show of the 1930s, and his later career as a dramatic actor.&lt;ref name="WVobit"&gt;Obituary ''[[Variety Obituaries|Variety]]'', June 22, 1966, page 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Wynn was born Isaiah Edwin Leopold in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania. His father, who manufactured and sold women's hats, was born in [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]]. His mother, of Romanian and [[Turkish people|Turkish]] ancestry, came from [[Istanbul]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=aZpjAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=N3wDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4126,1046400 |title=Famed comedian Ed Wynn once owned theater in New Port Richey|date=January 2, 1979 |accessdate=September 19, 2008|publisher=[[St. Petersburg Times]]|author=Wilfred T. Neill}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wynn attended [[Central High School (Philadelphia)|Central High School]] in [[Philadelphia]] until age 15.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;Biography of Ed Wynn at [http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/participant.jsp?spid=210077&amp;apid=43177 Turner Classic Movies].&lt;/ref&gt; He ran away from home in his teens, worked as a hat salesman, and as a utility boy,&lt;ref name=bio /&gt; and eventually adapted his middle name "Edwin" into his new stage name, "Ed Wynn", to save his family the embarrassment of having a lowly comedian as a relative.

==Early career==
Wynn began his career in [[vaudeville]] in 1903&lt;ref&gt;"New York Hoorays for Ed Wynn" [https://books.google.com/books?id=pD8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA44&amp;dq=ed%20wynn&amp;pg=PA46#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false], ''LIFE'', December 20, 1937, p. 46, accessed May 31, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"August Clown" [https://books.google.com/books?id=4EcEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA74&amp;ots=ZKVNV46qUQ&amp;dq=wynn%20%26%20lewis&amp;pg=PA65#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false], ''LIFE'', July 26, 1948, p. 74, accessed May 31, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and was a star of the [[Ziegfeld Follies]] starting in 1914. During ''The Follies of 1915'', [[W. C. Fields]] allegedly caught Wynn [[Overacting|mugging]] for the audience under the table during Fields' ''Pool Room'' routine and knocked Wynn unconscious with his cue.&lt;ref&gt;"August Clown" [https://books.google.com/books?id=4EcEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA74&amp;ots=ZKVNV46qUQ&amp;dq=wynn%20%26%20lewis&amp;pg=PA70#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false], ''LIFE'', July 26, 1948, p. 70, accessed May 31, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Wynn wrote, directed, and produced many [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] shows in the subsequent decades, and was known for his silly costumes and props as well as for the giggly, wavering voice he developed for the 1921 musical review, ''The Perfect Fool''.

==Radio==
[[File:Ed Wynn 001.jpg|thumb|Ed Wynn as "Mr. Busybody" 1908]]
Although many gag writers later provided material for Wynn's performances in radio, television and movies, he was proud to boast that he had written every line he ever spoke during his early career as a stage performer.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

In the early 1930s Wynn hosted the popular [[radio show]] ''[[Texaco Star Theater|The Fire Chief]]'', heard in North America on Tuesday nights, sponsored by [[Texaco]] gasoline. Like many former vaudeville performers who turned to radio in the same decade, the stage-trained Wynn insisted on playing for a live studio audience, doing each program as an actual stage show, using visual bits to augment his written material, and in his case, wearing a colorful costume with a red fireman's helmet. He usually bounced his gags off announcer/straight man [[Graham McNamee]]; Wynn's customary opening, "Tonight, Graham, the show's gonna be different," became one of the most familiar tag-lines of its time; a sample joke: "Graham, my uncle just bought a new second-handed car... he calls it Baby! I don't know, it won't go anyplace without a rattle!"

Wynn reprised his Fire Chief radio character in two movies, ''Follow the Leader'' (1930) and ''The Chief'' (1933). Near the height of his radio fame (1933) he founded his own short-lived radio network the [[Amalgamated Broadcasting System]], which lasted only five weeks, nearly destroying the comedian. According to radio historian Elizabeth McLeod, the failed venture left Wynn deep in debt, divorced and finally, suffering a nervous breakdown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.otrr.org/FILES/Articles/Elizabeth%20McLeod/wynn.htm|title =  Tonight The Program's Gonna Be Different!The Life and Times of Ed Wynn, The Fire Chief|date = |accessdate=June 2, 2015|website = Old Time Radio Researchers Group|publisher = |last =McLeod |first =Elizabeth }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wynn was offered the title role in [[MGM]]'s 1939 screen adaptation of ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', but turned it down, as did his Ziegfeld contemporary W. C. Fields. The part went to [[Frank Morgan]].

==Television==
Ed Wynn first appeared on television on July 7, 1936 in a brief, ad-libbed spot with Graham McNamee during an NBC experimental television broadcast.  In the 1949–50 season, Ed Wynn hosted one of the first network, comedy-variety television shows, on CBS, and won both a [[Peabody Award]] and an [[Emmy Award]] in 1949. [[Buster Keaton]], [[Lucille Ball]], and [[The Three Stooges]] all made guest appearances with Wynn.  This was the first CBS variety television show to originate from Los Angeles, which was seen live on the west coast, but filmed via [[kinescope]] for distribution in the Midwest and East, as the national coaxial cable had yet to be completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://archive.org/details/TheEdWynnShow1950|title = The Ed Wynn Show, 1950|date = |accessdate=December 8, 2014|website = Internet Archive – Moving Image Archive|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wynn was also a rotating host of [[NBC]]'s ''[[Four Star Revue]]'' from 1950 through 1952.

After the end of Wynn's third television series, ''The Ed Wynn Show'' (a short-lived situation comedy on [[NBC]]'s 1958–59 schedule), his son, actor [[Keenan Wynn]], encouraged him to make a career change rather than retire. The comedian reluctantly began a career as a dramatic actor in television and movies. Father and son appeared in three productions, the first of which was the 1956 ''[[Playhouse 90]]'' broadcast of [[Rod Serling]]'s play ''[[Requiem for a Heavyweight]]''. Ed was terrified of straight acting and kept goofing his lines in rehearsal. When the producers wanted to fire him, star [[Jack Palance]] said he would quit if they fired Ed. (However, unbeknownst to Wynn, supporting player [[Ned Glass]] was his secret understudy in case something ''did'' happen before air time.) On live broadcast night, Wynn surprised everyone with his pitch-perfect performance, and his quick ad libs to cover his mistakes. A dramatization of what happened during the production was later staged as an April 1960 ''[[Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse]]'' episode, "The Man in the Funny Suit", starring both senior and junior Wynns, with key figures involved in the original production also portraying themselves. Ed and his son also worked together in the [[Jose Ferrer]] film ''[[The Great Man]]'', with Ed again proving his unexpected skills in drama.
[[File:Ed Wynn Richard Crenna Slatterys People 1964.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Wynn (left) and [[Richard Crenna]] (right) in ''[[Slattery's People]]'', 1964.]]
''Requiem'' established Wynn as a serious dramatic actor who could easily hold his own with the best. His role in ''[[The Diary of Anne Frank (1959 film)|The Diary of Anne Frank]]'' (1959) won him an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for Best Supporting Actor.

Also in 1959, Wynn appeared on Serling's TV series ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'' in  "[[One for the Angels]]". Serling, a longtime admirer, had written that episode especially for him, and Wynn later in 1963 starred in the episode "[[Ninety Years Without Slumbering]]". For the rest of his life, Wynn skillfully moved between comic and dramatic roles. He appeared in feature films and anthology television, endearing himself to new generations of fans.

==Cartoons==
Wynn was caricatured in the [[Merrie Melodies]] cartoon shorts ''Shuffle Off to Buffalo'' (1933) and ''[[I've Got to Sing a Torch Song]]'' (1933), and as a pot of jam in the [[Betty Boop]] short ''[[Betty in Blunderland]]'' (1934).

==Films==
He appeared as the Fairy Godfather in [[Jerry Lewis]]' ''[[Cinderfella]]''. His performance as Paul Beaseley in the 1958 film ''[[The Great Man]]'' earned him nominations for a [[Golden Globe Award]] for "Best Supporting Actor" and a [[BAFTA Award]] for "Best Foreign Actor". The following year he received his first (and only) nomination for an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] for his role as Mr. Dussell in ''[[The Diary of Anne Frank (1959 film)|The Diary of Anne Frank]]'' (1959). Six years later he appeared in the Bible epic ''[[The Greatest Story Ever Told]]''.

==Disney==
Wynn provided the voice of the [[Mad Hatter]] in [[Walt Disney]]'s film, ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'' and played The Toymaker alongside [[Annette Funicello]] and [[Tommy Sands (entertainer)|Tommy Sands]] in [[Babes in Toyland (1961 film)|Walt Disney's ''Babes in Toyland'']] released in 1961.

Possibly his best-remembered film appearance was in Walt Disney's ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'' (1964), in which he played eccentric man Uncle Albert floating around just beneath the ceiling in uncontrollable mirth, singing "[[I Love to Laugh]]".

Re-teaming with the Disney team the following year, in ''[[That Darn Cat! (1965 film)|That Darn Cat!]]'' (1965) featuring [[Dean Jones (actor)|Dean Jones]] and [[Hayley Mills]], Wynn filled out the character of Mr. Hofstedder, the watch jeweler with his bumbling charm. He also had brief roles in ''[[The Absent Minded Professor]]'' (as the [[Ed_Wynn#Radio|fire chief]], in a scene alongside his son [[Keenan Wynn]], who played the film's antagonist) and ''[[Son of Flubber]]'' (as county agricultural agent A.J. Allen). His final performance, as Rufus in Walt Disney's ''[[The Gnome-Mobile]]'', was released a few months after his death.

In addition to Disney films, Wynn was also an actor in the Disneyland production ''The Golden Horseshoe Revue''.

==Death==
[[File:Ed Wynn Grave.JPG|thumb|150px|The niche of Ed Wynn, in the Great Mausoleum, Forest Lawn Glendale.]]
Wynn died June 19, 1966 in [[Beverly Hills, California]] of [[Esophageal cancer|throat cancer]],&lt;ref name=bio /&gt; aged 79. He is interred at [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Glendale|Forest Lawn Memorial Park]] in [[Glendale, California|Glendale]], in The Great Mausoleum, Daffodil Corridor, Columbarium of the Dawn, alongside his son [[Keenan Wynn]], his granddaughter Emily Wynn (February 13, 1960 – November 27, 1980), who died from [[lupus]] and his older sister Blanche Leopold (May 18, 1880 – December 26, 1973). His bronze grave marker reads "Dear God, Thanks... Ed Wynn". According to his granddaughter Hilda Levine, [[Walt Disney]], who would die just a few months later, served as one of his casket bearers. [[Red Skelton]], who was discovered by Wynn, stated: "His death is the first time he ever made anyone sad."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', July 1, 1966&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Wynn's distinct voice was deliberately emulated by [[Alan Tudyk]] for the character King Candy in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s animated film ''[[Wreck-It Ralph]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Cerabona|first=Ron|title=Giving Voice to an Old-Timer |url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/giving-voice-to-an-oldtimer-20130426-2ijn4.html |website=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=August 7, 2016|date=April 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wynn was posthumously named a [[Disney Legends|Disney Legend]] on August 10, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insidethemagic.net/2013/07/steve-jobs-dick-clark-billy-crystal-john-goodman-among-disney-legends-awards-recipients-announced-for-2013-d23-expo/ Steve Jobs, Dick Clark, Billy Crystal, John Goodman among Disney Legends Awards recipients announced for 2013 D23 Expo]&lt;/ref&gt;
