Delfino's second CD, ''I Wanna Be Famous'', came out in June, 2008 on the Loudmouth Records label, and was officially the first CD ever to be released by that label.  It has received praise from Time Out New York,&lt;ref&gt;[http://bp1.blogger.com/_rX2gMBHZt-g/SFApcTpmnfI/AAAAAAAAASs/dNwbEVIEtuw/s1600-h/Time+Out+JD+Famous.jpg "Minstrel Cramps"] Time Out New York, June 12–18, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Time Out London, and [[Blender (magazine)|Blender Magazine]]'s Rob Tannenbaum, who described Delfino as "The Joan Baez of the Vagina Song."

==Politics==
Delfino managed the 2005 mayoral campaign of [[Christopher X. Brodeur]], and she was featured in the 2009 documentary, ''[[The Promise of New York]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1703674/ "Jessica Delfino"] The Internet Movie Database&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing==
Delfino wrote for [[MTV]]'s [[game show]], ''[[I Bet You Will]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0420413/fullcredits#writers "I Bet You Will (2002)"] imdb.com&lt;/ref&gt;  Later, Morgan Spurlock hired her to write songs for his recent documentary film, ''[[What Would Jesus Buy?]]''.

Delfino writes a blog&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jessydelfino.blogspot.com "Jessy Delfino's Blog"] jessydelfino.blogspot.com&lt;/ref&gt; that [[Wil Wheaton]] called "the funniest thing I've ever read."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wilwheaton.net/mt/archives/001379.php "Slow Tempo In C"] WIL WHEATON dot NET, September 17, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;  She has also been a regular contributor for [[Turner Network Television|TNT]]'s ''[[Saving Grace (TV series)|Saving Grace]]'' [[television series]] blog.

==Controversy==

On December 19, 2006, [[Catholic League (U.S.)|Catholic League]] president [[William A. Donohue]] publicly attacked Delfino's act, asserting that it "provides ammunition" to Muslim terrorists by "harboring a depraved understanding of liberty."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicleague.org/christmas-season-marked-by-obscenities-2/ "Christmas Season Marked by Obscenities"] Catholic League Press Release, December 19, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  In response, Delfino stated, "I was brought up Catholic, and I was also brought up to believe that it isn't anti-Catholic to celebrate the life-giving and life-nurturing parts of a woman’s body.  I don’t know why William Donohue hates women’s bodies.  I don’t know why he is afraid of refocusing attention on humanity's true source of creation, the mysterious and magical womb.  But I do know that William Donohue is a hypocrite and a bigot, who has publicly made outrageous and highly-offensive anti-Semitic, and now anti-Muslim statements.  And that certainly doesn't make him a better Catholic than I am.  William Donohue does not speak for all Catholics.  He doesn't speak for me."&lt;ref&gt;[http://jessydelfino.blogspot.com/2006/12/for-immediate-release-nyc-artist.html "NYC ARTIST RESPONDS TO CATHOLIC LEAGUE’S ATTACK"] Jessica Delfino's Press release, December 21, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
 
On the day after [[Google]] announced its purchase of [[YouTube]], YouTube removed a popular video of one of Delfino's songs, the subject of which was that her vagina was magic.  On October 11, 2008, that same video was featured as the top pick on [[playboy.com]]'s "Video Hotlist," and was featured on the main front page of [[playboy.com]]'s Web site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_rX2gMBHZt-g/SPEs6QWyNLI/AAAAAAAAAec/IRbAMw_SGTU/s1600-h/Picture+3.png "playboy.com"] October 11, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://jessydelfino.blogspot.com/2006/10/my-pussy-is-magic-banned-by-youtube_11.html "'MY PUSSY IS MAGIC' BANNED BY YOUTUBE!!!"] Jessy Delfino's Blog, October 11, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
