== Career ==
=== Stage ===
After leaving [[Juilliard School|Juilliard]], Grammer had a three-year internship with the [[Old Globe Theatre]] in [[San Diego]] in the late 1970s before a stint in 1980 at the [[Guthrie Theater]] in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]]. He made his Broadway debut in 1981 as "Lennox" in ''[[Macbeth]]'', taking [[Macbeth (character)|the lead role]] when [[Philip Anglim]] withdrew after receiving negative reviews. Grammer then played [[Michael Cassio]] in a Broadway revival of ''[[Othello]]'', with [[James Earl Jones]] and [[Christopher Plummer]]. In 1983 he performed in the demo of the [[Stephen Sondheim]]–[[James Lapine]] production ''[[Sunday in the Park with George]]'', starring [[Mandy Patinkin]]. In 2000, Grammer again played ''Macbeth'' on Broadway, in a production that closed after only 10 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | access-date=2016-02-20 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/20/theater/macbeth-will-close-after-just-10-days-on-broadway.html | title='Macbeth' Will Close After Just 10 Days on Broadway | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=2000-06-20 | last=Mckinley | first=Jesse | issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 18, 2010, Grammer made his [[Broadway musical]] debut playing the role of Georges in a revival of the [[Jerry Herman]]/[[Harvey Fierstein]] musical ''[[La Cage aux Folles (musical)|La Cage aux Folles]]'', for which he was nominated for a [[Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Musical]]. Grammer originated the roles of Charles Frohman and Captain Hook in the Broadway premiere of the musical ''[[Finding Neverland (musical)|Finding Neverland]]'' in March 2015, continuing with the roles through June 28, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ibdb.com/Production/View/498337 | title= ''Finding Neverland'' | publisher= [[Internet Broadway Database]] ([[The Broadway League]]) | accessdate= October 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to the stage from January 19 to April 3, 2016. Most recently he made an appearance in the West End production of ''[[Big Fish (musical)|Big Fish]]''.&lt;ref name="ibdb-kelsey"&gt;{{cite web | access-date=2016-02-22 | url=http://www.ibdb.com/Person/View/74304 | title=Kelsey Grammer | publisher=[[Internet Broadway Database]] ([[The Broadway League]])}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Television ===
Grammer's television career began in the early 1980s when he portrayed [[Stephen Edward Smith|Stephen Smith]] in the [[NBC]] miniseries ''[[Kennedy (miniseries)|Kennedy]]''.

====''Cheers'', ''Frasier'', and ''Wings''====
Grammer came to broader public attention in 1984 as Dr. [[Frasier Crane]] in the [[NBC]] sitcom ''[[Cheers]]''. Grammer's former Juilliard classmate and Broadway co-star Patinkin suggested Grammer to the New York [[casting (performing arts)|casting director]], and he got what was supposed to be a six-episode job, but ended up as a regular cast member until May 1993, when the show ended.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://movies.yahoo.com/person/kelsey-grammer/biography.html|title = Kelsey Grammer Biography|website = [[Yahoo! Movies]]|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121009230813/http://movies.yahoo.com/person/kelsey-grammer/biography.html|archive-date = October 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1993 the character became the center of the spin-off ''[[Frasier]]'', one of the most successful spin-offs in TV history. In addition to starring, he also directed more than 30 episodes, especially during the second half of the series, and sang the closing theme "Tossed Salads and Scrambled Eggs." ''Frasier'' was nominated for and won many [[Frasier#Awards|awards]] during its 11-year run, concluding in May 2004.

In 2001, he negotiated a US $700,000-per-episode salary for ''Frasier''. His 20-year run playing Dr. Frasier Crane ties a length set by [[James Arness]] in playing [[Matt Dillon (Gunsmoke)|Marshal Matt Dillon]] on ''[[Gunsmoke]]'' from 1955 to 1975&lt;ref name="tvg" /&gt; but was surpassed by [[Richard Belzer]] in playing [[John Munch|Det. John Munch]] on ''[[Homicide: Life on the Street]]'' and ''[[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit]]'' since 1993.

Frasier Crane also had a [[crossover (fiction)|crossover]] appearance in 1993 ''[[Wings (1990 TV series)|Wings]]'' episode "Planes, Trains, &amp; Visiting Cranes".

====Post-''Frasier''====
In 2004, Grammer starred as [[Ebenezer Scrooge]] in the well-received [[television film|made-for-television]] [[film adaptation]] of the stage musical of [[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[A Christmas Carol (musical)|A Christmas Carol]]''.
 
In 2005, Grammer returned to television.

Tompkins]], as well as [[Lee Mack]] from the British version of the show. Grammer appeared in only short opening and closing segments in each episode. Many of the [[Sketch comedy|sketches]] from the British version were re-created, such as the "California Dreamin'", "English Course", and "Sign Language" sketches. Only six episodes of the show were made, and it was [[Cancellation (television)|canceled]] after only four of them had aired.

In 2007, Grammer starred with [[Patricia Heaton]] in the American sitcom ''[[Back to You (TV series)|Back to You]]''. It was canceled by Fox after its first season.

His next attempt, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Hank (2009 TV series)|Hank]]'', fared even worse. It was canceled after only five episodes had aired. Grammer later commented, "Honestly, it just wasn't very funny."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://tvseriesfinale.com/tv-show/hank-kelsey-grammer-canceled-sitcom|title = ''Hank'': Kelsey Grammer says He Scrapped the Cancelled Sitcom|date = December 7, 2009|last = Kimball|first = Trevor|archive-url = https://archive.is/20120716104754/http://tvseriesfinale.com/tv-show/hank-kelsey-grammer-canceled-sitcom/|archive-date = 2012-07-16|dead-url = no|access-date = 2016-02-22|website = tvseriesfinale.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his divorce from Alderman, Grammer had a daughter, [[Greer Grammer|Kandace Greer Grammer]] ("Greer Grammer"; born February 15, 1992), with hair and makeup stylist Barrie Buckner.

====Murder of Karen Grammer====
On July 1, 1975, Grammer's younger sister, 18-year-old Karen Grammer, was abducted, raped, and murdered by [[Freddie Glenn]], Michael Corbett, and one other man. Grammer, then 20, identified her body. He and his sister had been close, and he was devastated by her death; his later bouts of alcoholism and drug addiction were fueled in part by guilt and depression.&lt;ref name="Vanity Fair"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2015/04/kelsey-grammer-sister-death-finding-neverland|work = [[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|date = May 2015|title = Out to Lunch with Kelsey Grammer|first = John|last = Heilpern|accessdate = April 24, 2015|archivedate = April 21, 2015|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150421001356/http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2015/04/kelsey-grammer-sister-death-finding-neverland|deadurl = no|publisher = [[Condé Nast]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with [[Oprah Winfrey]], Grammer stated he could consider forgiving the men involved if they would at least take responsibility for the crime, but that they all continued to say they were innocent. In the same interview, Grammer expressed his loss of faith for a few years after Karen's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6Sf4Ek4b8 | title=Kelsey Grammer | series=Oprah's Next Chapter | network=[[Oprah Winfrey Network (U.S. TV channel)|Oprah Winfrey Network]] | airdate=26 August 2012 | author-link1=Oprah Winfrey | first1=Oprah | last1=Winfrey | season=2 | series-link=Oprah's Next Chapter | number=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently forgave Glenn, but refused to support his release, saying it would "be a betrayal of my sister's life."&lt;ref name="Vanity Fair"/&gt;

He named his daughter [[Spencer Grammer|Spencer Karen Grammer]] in part for his sister.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Lawsuits ===
In 1995, Grammer was accused of [[statutory rape]] of his child's babysitter, who was 15 at the time, but a grand jury did not indict him due to there being no physical evidence, only tapes of voicemail messages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/25/nyregion/a-grand-jury-refuses-to-indict-frasier-star-on-a-sex-charge.html|title=A Grand Jury Refuses to Indict 'Frasier' Star on a Sex Charge|publisher=The New York Times|date=February 25, 1995|accessdate=July 25, 2018|}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, he was sued by ex-girlfriend Cerlette Lamme for [[defamation]] of character and [[privacy law|invasion of privacy]] over content he included in his autobiography ''So Far''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.cosmicbaseball.com/grammer9.html|title = Kelsey Grammer 1999 Cosmic Player Plate|publisher = Cosmicbaseball.com|accessdate = December 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1996, he crashed his [[Dodge Viper]] while intoxicated, and subsequently checked into the [[Betty Ford Center]] (an [[Drug rehabilitation|alcohol rehabilitation]] clinic) for 30 days.&lt;ref name="Tribute.ca"/&gt;
In 1998, Grammer filed a lawsuit against [[Seth Warshavsky|Internet Entertainment Group]] (IEG), which Grammer claimed had stolen from his home a [[celebrity sex tape|videotape]] of him having sex with a woman. IEG countersued Grammer, denying it was in possession of such a tape, and Grammer's suit was eventually dropped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,614966,00.html |title=Report: Kelsey's 'X'-Files |website=[[People (magazine)|People]] |publisher=[[Time Inc.]] |date=June 7, 1999 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402160641/http://www.people.com/people/article/0%2C%2C614966%2C00.html |archive-date=April 2, 2015 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; IEG President [[Seth Warshavsky]] later said, "We have been presented with another Kelsey Grammer tape. But we have no plans to air it. We are still evaluating it at this time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.eonline.com/news/37400/kelsey-grammer-sex-tape-suit-unsealed|title = Kelsey Grammer Sex Tape Suit Unsealed|publisher = [[NBCUniversal]]|first = Daniel|last = Frankel|date = December 3, 1998|archivedate = April 24, 2015|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150424040942/http://www.eonline.com/news/37400/kelsey-grammer-sex-tape-suit-unsealed|deadurl = no|website = [[E!|E! Online]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grammer later reflected,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Whether or not you're a celebrity—even if you're just an old slob with a video camera—you don't realize you shouldn't do it. So you throw the tape in the back of a dark closet until your old girlfriend remembers it's there because you're famous now and she's not. But if you're not prepared to do the time, don't do the crime.&lt;ref name="maximonline.com"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.maximonline.com/articles/index.aspx?a_id=7159|title = The Beast Unleashed!|work = [[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]]|accessdate = December 19, 2009|archivedate = December 24, 2008|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081224050430/http://www.maxim.com/articles/index.aspx?a_id=7159|publisher = [[Biglari Holdings]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In August 2008, [[Freedom's Watch|Bradley Blakeman]], a former aide to [[George W. Bush]], filed a copyright lawsuit in federal court on [[Long Island]] over Grammer's movie ''[[Swing Vote (2008 film)|Swing Vote]]'', claiming that parts of its plot and marketing had been stolen from him. The lawsuit claimed that Blakeman had given a copyrighted screenplay called ''Go November'' to Grammer in 2006, and that Grammer agreed to develop the project and star as a Republican president but instead ended up playing a similar role in ''Swing Vote'', which was released on August 1, 2008. Grammer's spokesman dismissed the claims as "[[frivolous litigation|frivolous]]" and a "waste of time". The lawsuit was settled in 2010 for $10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Keith|last=Staskiewicz|url=http://ew.com/article/2010/03/30/kelsey-grammer-settles-lawsuit-for-only-10/|title=Kelsey Grammer settles lawsuit for only $10|publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=March 30, 2010|accessdate=February 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Drug abuse issues ===
Grammer has a history as a frequent [[alcoholism|abuser of alcohol]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  In 1988, Grammer was arrested for [[driving under the influence|drunk driving]] and [[cocaine]] possession and sentenced to 30 days in jail.&lt;ref name="Tribute.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.tribute.ca/people/Kelsey+Grammer/3430/17850|title = Kelsey Grammer bio: An American Carol Actor|publisher = Tribute Entertainment Media Group|accessdate = December 19, 2009|website = [[Tribute (magazine)|Tribute]]|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140221204321/http://www.tribute.ca/people/kelsey-grammer/3430/17850/|dead-url = no|archive-date = 2014-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1990, Grammer was arrested again for cocaine possession and was sentenced to three years' [[probation]], fined $500, and required to perform 300 hours of [[community service]].&lt;ref name="Tribute.ca"/&gt; In January 1991, Grammer was given an additional two years' probation for violating his original probation through additional cocaine use.&lt;ref name="Tribute.ca"/&gt; The cast and producers of both ''Frasier'' and ''Cheers'' held [[intervention (counseling)|interventions]] to attempt to help him. Grammer's personal problems affected his work; co-star [[Bebe Neuwirth]] and writer [[Ken Levine (TV personality)|Ken Levine]] cited delays with rehearsals and filming due to his erratic behavior.&lt;ref name="gqraftery201210" /&gt; Writer [[Dan O'Shannon]] recalled, however, that&lt;ref name="gqraftery201210"&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.gq.com/entertainment/movies-and-tv/201210/cheers-oral-history-extended?printable=true|title = The Best TV Show That's Ever Been|work = [[GQ]]|date = October 2012|accessdate = September 27, 2012|author = Raftery, Brian|publisher = [[Advance Publications]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was the most amazing transformation I'd ever seen.{{r|gqraftery201210}}}}

Grammer credits his religion for helping him through with his struggles with alcohol and drug abuse, as well as his personal tragedies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |interviewer=[[Larry King]] |title=Larry King Live: The Unsinkable Kelsey Grammer |url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0103/16/lkl.00.html |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=March 16, 2001 |access-date=February 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Health problems ===
On May 31, 2008, while [[paddleboarding]] with his then-wife [[Camille Grammer|Camille]] in Hawaii, Grammer experienced a heart attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20203756,00.html|title = Kelsey Grammer Suffers Mild Heart Attack|publisher = [[Time Inc.]]|date = June 2, 2008|accessdate = June 10, 2008|website = [[People (magazine)|People]]|last = Fleeman|first = Mike}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was discharged on June 4, 2008, and was said to be "resting comfortably" at his Hawaiian residence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/b141124_kelsey_grammer_of_hospital.html Kelsey Grammer Out of the Hospital] from ''[[E!
