'''Douglas Steven Benson''' (born July 2, 1962) is an [[United States|American]] comedian, [[marijuana rights]] advocate, television host, actor and judge who has appeared on ''[[Getting Doug With High]]'', ''[[Comedy Central Presents]]'', ''[[Best Week Ever]], [[Trailer Park Boys]],'' and was a contestant on ''[[Last Comic Standing]]'' in the show's [[Last Comic Standing 5|fifth season]]. He currently serves as a judge for the [[Comedy Central]] series ''[[The High Court with Doug Benson]]''.

In 2007, he starred in the film ''[[Super High Me]]'', a documentary about marijuana usage. Benson also currently hosts the popular ''Doug Loves Movies'' [[podcast]] along with his weekly marijuana video podcast show ''[[Getting Doug with High]]''. His Comedy Central series ''[[The Benson Interruption]]'' ended its first season in December 2010 and was turned into a monthly podcast in January 2011.

==Early life==
Benson was born and raised in [[San Diego]], [[California]], to parents Wendy (Young), a [[pharmacy]] [[clerk]], and Robert Matthew Benson, a former English teacher turned salesman. After attending [[Grossmont College]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dr. Drew Podcast #54: Doug Benson|url=http://drdrew.com/054-doug-benson/}}&lt;/ref&gt; a community college in [[El Cajon]], he moved to [[Los Angeles]] to pursue an acting career. Benson was raised [[Methodist]].&lt;ref name="youtube"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCRD7ZddPZo|title=Aubrey Plaza &amp;amp; Alia Shawkat &amp;#124; Getting Doug with High|website=YouTube|accessdate=2018-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a child, Benson struggled with vertigo and poor depth perception as a result of his close-set eyes. &lt;ref name="youtube.com"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAD30GGkaco |title= Brendon Walsh, Josh Wolf, Joey CoCo Diaz, Ari Shaffir &amp; Todd Glass {{!}} Getting Doug with High |website= YouTube |accessdate= 2018-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===Early career===
While in Los Angeles, Benson began doing stand-up after he and two other friends dared each other to. One of them didn't show, and the other one signed up too late. Benson claimed that "I went in anyway and did my three minutes of whatever I could come with and people actually laughed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buddytv.com/articles/last-comic-standing/exclusive-interview-doug-benso-9726.aspx |title=Exclusive Interview: Doug Benson of 'Last Comic Standing' |publisher=Buddytv.com |date=2007-08-22 |accessdate=2014-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 22, Benson began performing regularly as a stand-up comedian; however, it wasn't until 28 that he became a stoner, after a week's worth of gigs smoking pot afterwards alongside [[Brian Posehn]] and [[Greg Proops]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nerdist.com/2013/10/nerdist-podcast-episode-420-w-doug-benson/ |title=Nerdist Podcast: Episode 420 W/ Doug Benson |publisher=[[Nerdist.com]] |date=2013-10-10 |accessdate=2014-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his earliest television appearances as a stand-up in the late 1980s and early 1990s on programs such as [[Comedy Central]]'s ''The A-List'' and ''Two Drink Minimum'' and was one of the featured comedians in the cast of [[Joel Hodgson]]'s sketch-comedy pilot ''[[The TV Wheel]]'' which aired on Comedy Central in 1995. One of Benson's earliest jobs in television was writing for the [[MTV]] game-show ''[[Trashed (game show)|Trashed]]'' in 1994.

Along with comedian friends [[Arj Barker]] and Tony Camin, Benson co-created and performed in the comedy stage-show ''[[The Marijuana-Logues]]''. He also hosted ''[[High Times]]'' ' 6th annual [[Stony Awards]] with rapper [[Redman (rapper)|Redman]].

===Comedy albums===
Benson appeared on the comedy compilation album ''[[Comedy Death-Ray (album)|Comedy Death-Ray]]''.

On August 4, 2009, Benson's second album, ''Unbalanced Load'', was released by [[Comedy Central Records]]. His third album, ''Hypocritical Oaf'' was released on August 31, 2010. Benson aims to record a new album every April 20 (with a subsequent summer release date) for as many consecutive years as possible.&lt;ref name="wtfpod" /&gt; Benson's fourth album, ''Potty Mouth,'' was released on August 29, 2011. The pattern continued with the release of his fifth album, ''Smug Life'', which was released on July 3, 2012, and ''Gateway Doug'', his sixth album, released on July 9, 2013. On July 8, 2014, Doug released a sequel to ''Gateway Doug'' entitled ''Gateway Doug 2: Forced Fun''. His latest album release is ''Promotional Tool'' which came out on June 9, 2015.

===''Doug Loves Movies'' podcast===
In 2006, Benson began hosting a weekly comedy [[podcast]], titled ''Doug Loves Movies'' (formerly ''I Love Movies with Doug Benson''), which is recorded in front of a live audience at the [[Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre]] in Los Angeles. The show typically tapes weekly, and is later archived on iTunes for fans to listen to for free. Benson and guests talk about movies and comedy both. Benson's guests have included such notables as [[Daniel Van Kirk]] as [[Mark Wahlberg]], [[John Lithgow]], [[Leonard Maltin]], [[Brian Posehn]], [[Joe Rogan]], [[Zach Galifianakis]], [[Sarah Silverman]], [[Patton Oswalt]], [[Jon Hamm]], [[Adam Carolla]], [[David Cross]], [[Bob Odenkirk]], [[Scott Aukerman]], [[Adam Scott (actor)|Adam Scott]], [[Ron Bennington]], [[Aziz Ansari]], [[Amy Poehler]], [[Wayne Federman]], [[Elisabeth Shue]], [[Aubrey Plaza]], [[Michael Cera]], [[Edgar Wright]], [[Paul F. Tompkins]], [[T.J. Miller]], [[Kumail Nanjiani]], [[Gillian Jacobs]], [[Michael Sheen]].

A regular feature of the podcast is the [[Leonard Maltin]] Game, which has been described as ''[[Name That Tune]]'' with movies instead of songs.&lt;ref name="cm"&gt;Culture Mob article: "[http://culturemob.com/blog/doug-benson-at-the-arlington-cinema-drafthouse Doug Benson at the Arlington Cinema Drafthouse]."&lt;/ref&gt; The game consists of Benson reading excerpts from a Leonard Maltin review and guests wagering how many names, read from the bottom of the cast list up, it would take for them to identify the movie.

Other regular features of the podcast include the segments ''Tweet Relief: Tweets About Movies'', ''Watch This/Not That'', ''Not for Emetophobes'', and ''From the Corrections Department'', as well as the games ''Build a Title'', ''Name a Movie'', ''A-B-C-Deez Nuts'', ''How Much Did This Shit Make?'', ''Lincoln or Bane?'', ''Love, Like, Hate, Hate-Like'', ''Doing Lines with Mark Wahlberg'', ''Last Man Stanton'', ''Whose Tagline Is It Anyway'', ''Now Buscemi Now You Don't'', ''Tell The Truth!, Live Die Repeat, Alex and Jason and Deb's IMDB game,'' and ''F Marry Kill: Movies''.

At the conclusion of many of the early podcasts, Doug would state "As always, [[Willem Dafoe]] is a Shithead," which resulted in so many people wondering about why, that [[Google]] searches began to automatically complete the phrase as a suggested match. The Willem Dafoe comment started as a joke based on the fact that it would seemingly be the only bad words ever uttered about Dafoe, but many people didn't catch on and, after explaining it a few times, Benson decided to let Dafoe rest. Now, the runners up in the Leonard Maltin game are allowed to name one shithead as a consolation prize.

In 2010, Benson started an annual, 2 hour Twelve Guests of Christmas special every holiday season. This episode features 12 guests (occasionally more) rather than the usual 3 guests and they play an elimination style Leonard Maltin Game. [[Scott Aukerman]] won the first year, while [[Graham Elwood]] dominated the next two years in a row.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://astrecords.com/dlm/index.php#season5 |title=Doug Loves Movies |publisher=Astrecords.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2013 champion was podcast fan and [[Pardcast-A-Thon]] auction winner, Sean Sakimae. Sakimae also qualified for the next Tournament of Champions for naming the film [[Titanic (1997 film)|''Titanic'']] in negative names and winning the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DougLovesMovies/~3/vyqrarAccDo/jon-hamm-rich-sommer-josh-malina-and-10-more-compete |title=Doug Loves Movies : Jon Hamm, Rich Sommer, Josh Malina and 10 more compete |publisher=Feedproxy.google.com |date=2013-12-18 |accessdate=2014-02-12 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Riki Lindhome]] beat [[Jimmy Pardo]] in the finals of the 2014 edition when Pardo couldn't get the name [[Lori Singer]] when going negative three on ''[[Footloose (1984 film)|Footloose]]''. Scott Aukerman bested [[Sarah Silverman]] for his second win in 2015.

In addition to ''Doug Loves Movies'', Benson has begun recording "The Benson Interruption" and releasing it as a monthly podcast for $1.99 and has appeared on numerous other podcasts, including ''[[Comedy Bang Bang]]'', ''[[The Joe Rogan Experience]]'', ''[[WTF with Marc Maron]]'', ''[[The Adam Carolla Show (podcast)|The Adam Carolla Show]]'', ''[[The Nerdist Podcast|Nerdist]]'' with [[Chris Hardwick]], ''Mohr Stories'', ''You Made It Weird'' with [[Pete Holmes]], ''[[Never Not Funny]]'', and ''Who Charted'' with Howard Kremer and Kulap Vilaysack.

===''Getting Doug With High'' ===
Benson started a weekly [[talk-show]] on ''[[YouTube]]'' entitled ''[[Getting Doug with High]]'', that generally airs live every Wednesday at 4:15 p.m PST. Benson invites featured guests to recreationally smoke [[marijuana]] with him at [[4:20]]. He asks them questions and discusses topics (usually related to marijuana), and at the end of the segment, he makes them watch a magic trick. Notable guests on the show include [[Cheech Marin]], [[Tommy Chong]], [[Kevin Smith]], [[Jay Chandrasekhar]], [[Jack Black]], [[Andy Richter]], [[Dan Harmon]], [[Michael Ian Black]], [[Sarah Silverman]], [[Pete Holmes]], [[David Cross]], [[Aubrey Plaza]], [[Greg Proops]], [[Joey Diaz]], [[Horatio Sanz]], [[Jenny Slate]], [[Ron Funches]], [[Jeff Ross]], [[Doug Stanhope]], [[Todd Glass]], [[Brian Posehn]], [[Anthony Jeselnik]], [[Margaret Cho]], [[Kyle Kinane]], and [[Reggie Watts]] as well as comedy groups [[Trailer Park Boys]], [[Workaholics]], and [[Broad City]]. Occasionally, the show is done in front of a live audience in [[Los Angeles]] where the performers take turns inhaling from bags of [[Vaporizer (inhalation device)|vaporized]] marijuana.

==Film and television==

===''Super High Me''===
In 2008, Benson was the protagonist of the film ''[[Super High Me]]'' (a play on the name and concept of the film ''[[Super Size Me]]''), released on DVD on June 10, 2008. In the movie, Benson compares the results of not smoking any marijuana at all for 30 days versus the effects of smoking as much marijuana as possible for the same amount of time.&lt;ref name="pitts" /&gt; The film was produced by [[Red Envelope Entertainment]]. The results of the experiment were that it had little or no negative effects on Doug's health. Doug is currently suing the people who made the original film to stop a sequel.&lt;ref name="sfweekly"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfweekly.com/sanfrancisco/news-marijuana-cannabis-legalization-netflix-doug-benson-super-high-me-film/Content?oid=4420121|author=Chris Roberts|title=Why is Doug Benson Blocking a Super High Me Sequel? &amp;#124; Chem Tales &amp;#124; San Francisco &amp;#124; San Francisco News and Events|website=SF Weekly|accessdate=2018-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Benson Interruption''===
On November 5, 2010 Comedy Central began airing ''[[The Benson Interruption]]'', hosted by Benson. The show is based on the live stand-up comedy showcase of the same name that he has hosted in [[Los Angeles]] for many years. Special guests for the series include comedians [[Chris Hardwick]], [[Patton Oswalt]], [[Brian Posehn]], [[Adam Carolla]], [[Nick Swardson]], [[Rob Huebel]], [[Nick Kroll]], [[Thomas Lennon (actor)|Thomas Lennon]], [[Mary Lynn Rajskub]] and [[Eugene Mirman]].

The show [[Spin-off (media)|spun off]] into a monthly audio-only podcast on January 21, 2011, which took the TV show's format and altered it slightly by allowing the performances and conversations to play out in longer unedited episodes.

===''The High Court with Doug Benson''===
Benson currently serves as a [[judge]] on ''[[The High Court with Doug Benson]]'', a comedic [[court show]] on Comedy Central. During each episode Benson is under the influence of cannabis. All of the cases featured are real and all of his rulings are real and legally binding. The series premiered on February 28, 2017.&lt;ref name="EsquireRef"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zemler|first1=Emily|title=Judge Doug Benson Rules His Court With a Giant Bong|url=http://www.esquire.com/entertainment/tv/a53488/doug-benson-the-high-court/|publisher=''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]''|accessdate=2017-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other film work===
While working as a stand-in on numerous movies in the 1980s, he had visible roles as an extra in films such as ''[[Blade Runner]]'', ''[[Fast Times at Ridgemont High]]'', ''[[About Last Night...|About Last Night]]'' and a backup dancer in the [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney theme park]] attraction ''[[Captain EO]]''.&lt;ref name="wtfpod"&gt;''WTF with Marc Maron'' podcast episode: "[http://wtfpod.libsyn.com/episode-131-doug-benson Episode 131 - Doug Benson]."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Who Charted"&gt;''Who Charted?'' podcast episode: "[http://www.earwolf.com/episode/emotional-luggage Episode 48 - Emotional Luggage]."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other television work===
In the mid to late 1990s, Benson had small roles on [[HBO]]'s ''[[Mr. Show with Bob and David]]'', which was co-created by his friend [[David Cross]]. He also had small roles on ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'', ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]'', ''[[The Sarah Silverman Program]]'', ''[[Yes, Dear]]'' and ''[[Friends (TV series)|Friends]]''.

In 2007, Benson was a contestant on [[Last Comic Standing 5|fifth season]] of the [[NBC]] [[reality show]] ''[[Last Comic Standing]]''. He was voted off the program during the ninth episode, earning him 6th place overall.&lt;ref name="pitts"&gt;Pittsburglive.com article: "[http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/ae/s_585929.html Comedian Doug Benson going up in a cloud of success]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}."&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2000s, the comedian regularly appeared on the [[VH1]] show ''[[Best Week Ever]]'' and taped several episodes of ''[[Comedy Central Presents]]''.&lt;ref name="pitts" /&gt;

On December 29, 2009, Benson had a documentary special called ''The High Road with Doug Benson'' air on the [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4]] network. The special followed Benson and comedian [[Graham Elwood]] on one of their stand-up comedy tours.

Benson regularly appears as a panelist on the Comedy Central program ''[[@midnight]]'', and during the week of January 4â€“7, 2016, was featured during a weeklong special titled the "Benson Bowl," featuring many marijuana-related games. Benson currently ranks first in number of appearances on the show, as well as victories.

=="Red Eye" incident==
On March 17, 2009, the host of the [[Fox News]] comedy program ''[[Red Eye w/ Greg Gutfeld]]'' along with Benson as a panelist, joked about Canadian Lieutenant General [[Andrew Leslie (general)|Andrew Leslie's]] statement that the [[Canadian Armed Forces]] may require a one-year "synchronized break" once Canada's mission in [[Afghanistan]] ends in 2011.&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/tv/story/2009/03/23/redeye-soldiers-mocking.html |title=Fox host lampoons Canadian military's synchronized break during wartime |work=CBC News |date=March 23, 2009 |accessdate=2011-10-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110103031008/http://www.cbc.ca/arts/tv/story/2009/03/23/redeye-soldiers-mocking.html |archivedate=2011-01-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Meaning, the Canadian military wants to take a breather to do some [[yoga]], paint landscapes, run on the beach in gorgeous white Capri pants," Gutfeld said.&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"/&gt; "I didn't even know they were in the war", added Benson, then continued, "I thought that's where you go if you ''don't'' want to fight. Go chill in Canada."&lt;ref name="cbc.ca" /&gt; Gutfeld also said: "Isn't this the perfect time to invade this ridiculous country? They have no army!"&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"/&gt;

The segment drew wide attention and outrage in Canada after being posted on [[YouTube]] following the reported deaths of four Canadian soldiers in Afghanistan three days earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/Canada/2009/03/22/8847666-sun.html |title=Fox News mocks Canadian military â€“ Canada |website=Cnews.canoe.ca |date=March 22, 2009 |accessdate=2011-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Kathleen Harris, National Bureau Chief |url=http://www.torontosun.com/news/2009/03/22/8846946.html |title=U.S. talk show ridicules Canadian soldiers &amp;#124; News |work=Toronto Sun |date=March 22, 2009 |accessdate=2011-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-03/24/content_11060312.htm |title=Fox News host apologizes for mocking Canadian military_English_Xinhua |website=News.xinhuanet.com |date=March 24, 2009 |accessdate=2011-10-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107171320/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-03/24/content_11060312.htm |archivedate=2012-11-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Canada, at the time, had been in command of the [[NATO]] mission in the [[Kandahar Province]], the birthplace and former [[Taliban]] capital, for the past three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/canada-transfers-command-in-kandahar-to-us/article586220/|title=Canada transfers command in Kandahar to U.S.|date=July 7, 2011|author=Susan Sachs|newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]]|accessdate=2016-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the [[Helmand Province]], the two provinces were "home to some of the fiercest opposition to coalition forces" and reported to "have the highest casualty rates per province."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://afghanistan.blogs.cnn.com/2011/10/03/the-afghan-war-10-years-later-a-look-at-the-numbers/|title=The Afghan war 10 years later: A look at the numbers|newspaper=[[CNN]]|date=October 3, 2011|author=Manav Tanneeru and Lindsey Knight|accessdate=2016-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canadian Defence Minister [[Peter MacKay]] called on Fox to apologize for the satirical comments, describing the remarks as "despicable, hurtful and ignorant."&lt;ref name="cbc"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/fox-host-apologizes-for-mocking-of-canadian-forces-1.801729 |title=Fox host apologizes for mocking of Canadian Forces|publisher=''[[CBC News]]''|date=March 23, 2009|accessdate=2016-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benson was scheduled to appear in Canada at Edmonton's ''The Comic Strip'' April 3â€“5, 2009, but the shows were canceled after the owner received threats of "bodily injury" toward the American comic. "Some were saying he wouldn't make it from the airport to the club. For everyone's safety, we decided it was best to avoid the scenario altogether," said manager Rick Bronson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Kathleen Harris, National Bureau Chief |url=http://www.winnipegsun.com/news/canada/2009/03/24/8861056-sun.html |title=Apology fails to quell storm &amp;#124; Canada &amp;#124; News |work=Winnipeg Sun |date=March 24, 2009 |accessdate=2011-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benson offered an apology following the incident on ''[[CTV News]]'' ''[[Power Play (Canadian political affairs series)|Power Play with Tom Clark]]''.&lt;ref name="CTV1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/comedian-on-fox-news-show-apologizes-to-canada-1.382512|title=Comedian on Fox News show apologizes to Canada|publisher=[[CTV News]]|date=March 24, 2009|accessdate=2016-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The comedian stated that he was "ignorant about the situation in Afghanistan" and that the timing of the jokes were "completely out of line".&lt;ref name="CTV1" /&gt; "I honestly said things, in retrospect, I completely regret" said Benson and has vowed to "never appear on the show again".&lt;ref name="CTV1" /&gt;
