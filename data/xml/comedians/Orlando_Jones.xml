'''Orlando Jones''' (born April 10, 1968) is an American comedian and actor. He is known for being one of the original cast members of the sketch comedy series ''[[MADtv]]'' and for his role as the [[7 Up]] [[spokesman]] from 1999 to 2002.

==Early life==
Jones was born in [[Toulminville, Alabama]], on April 10, 1968. His father was a professional baseball player for the [[Philadelphia Phillies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=CSTB&amp;p_theme=cstb&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB4248FEA627003&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM | date=August 13, 2000 | newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] | first=Cindy | last=Pearlman | title=Orlando Jones}}&lt;/ref&gt; He moved to [[Mauldin, South Carolina]], when he was a teen and graduated from [[Mauldin High School]] in 1985. One of his early acting experiences involved playing a [[werewolf]] in a [[haunted house]] to help raise money for the junior/senior prom. Jones enrolled in the [[College of Charleston]], [[South Carolina]]. He left in 1990 without finishing his degree.

To pursue his interest in the entertainment industry, Jones, together with comedian Michael Fechter, formed a production company, Homeboy's Productions and Advertising. Together Jones and Fechter worked on several projects including a [[McDonald's]] commercial with basketball superstar [[Michael Jordan]] for the McDonald's specialty sandwich the "McJordan".

He scored his first Hollywood job in 1987, writing for the [[NBC]] comedy ''[[A Different World (TV series)|A Different World]]'', on which he had a small guest role in the season five finale. During 1991-92, Jones penned the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] series ''[[Roc (TV series)|Roc]]'' and, in 1993, he co-produced ''[[The Sinbad Show]]''. He also made a brief appearance on the FOX sitcom ''[[Herman's Head]]'' in 1992.

==Career==

===MADtv===
After hosting Fox's music series ''[[Sound FX]]'', in 1994, Jones became one of the original nine cast members of ''MADtv''. Unlike some of his fellow original repertory performers on ''MADtv'', Jones came to the show with limited sketch comedy experience. However, his comedy writing and television producing skills proved to be valuable to the early success of the show.

Throughout Seasons One and Two of ''MADtv'', Jones produced characters like the Cabana Chat band leader Dexter St. Croix and Reverend LaMont Nixon Fatback, the vocal follower of [[Christopher Walken]]. He was also noted for his impressions of [[Thomas Mikal Ford]], [[Temuera Morrison]], [[Warwick Davis]], [[Danny DeVito]], [[Michael Jai White]], [[Eddie Griffin]], and [[Ice Cube]].

After two seasons on ''MADtv'', Jones left the show at the end of its second season to pursue a movie career. However, Jones returned to ''MADtv'' in 2004 to celebrate its 200th episode.

===Other television projects===
Aside from ''MADtv'', Jones made many other television appearances. Perhaps his most popular and enduring television appearance was not in the form of a sitcom or television drama, but rather in a series of humorous commercials for a [[Soft drink|soda]] company. In 2000, Jones became the spokesperson for [[7 Up]] and he gained wide recognition.

This exposure led to a plethora of opportunities for Jones. First, he hosted an ''[[HBO First Look]]'' special in 2000 and then, in 2003, Jones was given his own late night talk show on [[FX (TV channel)|FX]] called ''[[The Orlando Jones Show]]''. Although his talk show was short lived, Jones continued to make additional television appearances. In  2003, he appeared on ''[[The Bernie Mac Show]]'' and on ''[[Girlfriends (U.S. TV series)|Girlfriends]]''. In 2006, Jones decided to return to television as one of the lead characters of ABC's crime drama ''[[The Evidence (TV series)|The Evidence]]'', as [[Cayman Bishop]]. He has also appeared in two episodes of ''[[Everybody Hates Chris]]'', the first in 2007 as Chris's substitute teacher and the second in 2008 as Clint Huckstable, an allusion to the character Cliff Huxtable played by [[Bill Cosby]] on ''[[The Cosby Show]]''.

In 2008, he appeared as Harold Wilcox, a violent veteran with [[PTSD]], on ''[[New Amsterdam (2008 TV series)|New Amsterdam]]''. In the first season of the show, Jones also starred on [[Nick Cannon]]'s ''[[Wild 'N Out]]''. Jones was the first guest star on the show. Jones was the co-host of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Crash Course (game show)|Crash Course]]'' (which was canceled after 4 episodes). On November 16, 2009, it was announced on [[TV Guide]] that Orlando has been cast as Marcus Foreman, [[Eric Foreman]]'s brother on ''[[House (TV series)|House]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Natalie |last=Abrams |title=House: Orlando Jones to Play Foreman's Brother |date=November 16, 2009 |url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/House-Orlando-Jones-1012154.aspx |work=[[TV Guide]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; appearing in the season six episode "[[Moving the Chains]]". In 2013, he was hired as a principal actor in the FOX television series ''[[Sleepy Hollow (TV series)|Sleepy Hollow]]''. The freshman drama opened to FOX's highest fall drama premiere numbers since the premiere of '24' in 2001. In 2016, Jones was cast as Mr. Nancy in ''[[American Gods (TV series)|American Gods]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Denise |last=Petski |title=‘American Gods’: Orlando Jones Cast In Starz Adaptation |url=http://deadline.com/2016/06/american-gods-orlando-jones-cast-starz-adaptation-1201773359/ |date=15 June 2016 |work=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |accessdate=15 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film projects===
After leaving MADtv, Jones expanded his cinema resume. He appeared in a bit part in his first big screen film, ''[[In Harm's Way]]'' (1991), Jones then joined [[Larry David]] in the feature ''[[Sour Grapes (film)|Sour Grapes]]'' (1998), playing the character of an itinerant man. Subsequently, he appeared in ''[[Woo (film)|Woo]]'' (1990), [[Mike Judge]]'s ''[[Office Space]]'' (1999), alongside fellow MADtv alumnus [[David Herman]], and in Barry Levinson's praised drama, ''[[Liberty Heights]]'' (1999). Since then, Jones has appeared in ''[[Magnolia (film)|Magnolia]]'' (1999), ''[[New Jersey Turnpikes]]'' (1999) and in [[Harold Ramis]]' ''[[Bedazzled (2000 film)|Bedazzled]]'' (2000).

During the 2000s, Jones' career began to branch out. In addition to his witty appearances in the 7-Up campaigns, Jones played the role of Clifford Franklin in ''[[The Replacements (film)|The Replacements]]'' (2000) and the horror film ''[[From Dusk till Dawn 3: The Hangman's Daughter]]'' (2003). In 2002, Jones landed the lead role of Daryl Chase in the action-dramedy ''[[Double Take (2001 film)|Double Take]]'' (2001), alongside [[Eddie Griffin]], and worked with [[David Duchovny]], [[Seann William Scott]] and [[Julianne Moore]] in [[Ivan Reitman]]'s sci-fi comedy, ''[[Evolution (2001 film)|Evolution]]'' (2001). Jones was also in the 2009 film ''[[Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant]]'' and he appeared as the computer Vox 114 in ''[[The Time Machine (2002 film)|The Time Machine]]'' (2002). His other more recent films includes ''Biker Boyz (2003)'', ''Godzilla'' (2005), ''[[Runaway Jury]]'' (2003) and ''Primeval'' (2004).  Jones appeared in an uncredited cameo and played in ''Grindhouse Planet Terror'' (2007 film).

In 2011 Jones appeared in the documentary film ''Looking for Lenny'' in which he talks about Lenny Bruce and freedom of speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/lenny-bruce-legacy-reexamined-20120310 |title=Lenny Bruce Legacy Reexamined |first=James |last=Sullivan |date=March 10, 2012 |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |accessdate=March 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Jones starred in [[Joe Penna]]'s original interactive thriller series ''Meridian'' created in conjunction with [[Fourth Wall Studios]].&lt;ref name="Tubefilter"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tubefilter.com/2012/11/14/mystery-guitar-man-joe-penna-meridian-interactive-thriller/ |first=Sam |last=Gutelle |date=November 14, 2012 |title=MysteryGuitarMan Joe Penna Brings Interactive Thriller To Rides.tv |work=[[Tubefilter]] |accessdate=January 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voice acting===
Jones has been featured in many voice acting projects over the years. In 1993, Jones appeared in ''[[Yuletide in the 'hood]]'' and in 1998, he made a guest appearance in the animated comedy TV Series, [[King of the Hill|King Of The Hill]]. More recently, he lent his voice to the TV series ''[[Father of the Pride]]'' and the video games [[Halo 2]] as the marine [[Sergeant Banks]] as well as other black marines and ''[[L.A. Rush]]''. In 2006, he co-created, produced and voice acted for the MTV2 animated series ''[[The Adventures of Chico and Guapo]]''.

In early April 2013, it was largely thought that Jones would be taking [[Tyler Perry]]'s place as [[Madea (Mabel Simmons)|Madea]]. This stemmed from Jones's own report that he would be taking over the role, and photography of himself impersonating Madea. This led to public outcry from fans. Perry later revealed, however, that this was an elaborate prank played by Jones, stating, "That was an [[April Fools' Day|April Fools']] joke that ''HE'' did. Not true. And not funny. When I’m done with Madea, she is done."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Scott |first=Tracy |url=http://s2smagazine.com/70127/tyler-perry-calls-orlando-jones-news-not-true-and-not-funny/ |title=Tyler Perry calls Orlando Jones’ news ‘not true and not funny’ |work=[[S2SMagazine]] |date=April 15, 2013 |accessdate=April 16, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140128021140/http://s2smagazine.com/70127/tyler-perry-calls-orlando-jones-news-not-true-and-not-funny/ |archivedate=January 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Jones married former model Jacqueline Staph in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.instyle.com/instyle/package/general/photos/0,,20352342_20355390_20762238,00.html |title=Celebrity Wedding: Orlando Jones &amp; Jacqueline Staph |work=[[InStyle]] |date=January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have a daughter. In October 2011, Jones provoked controversy when he joked on Twitter that someone should kill former [[Governor of Alaska]] and [[Vice presidential candidacy of Sarah Palin|Vice Presidential candidate]] [[Sarah Palin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/celebritology/post/orlando-jones-defends-kill-sarah-palin-tweet-joke-as-not-call-to-action/2011/10/25/gIQAdroJGM_blog.html |title=Orlando Jones defends ‘kill Sarah Palin’ tweet joke as not ‘a call to action,’ ‘artistic expression’ |first=Sarah Anne |last=Hughes |date=October 25, 2011 |newspaper=[[Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/orlando-jones-fire-tweets-urging-liberals-kill-sarah-palin-article-1.967845 |title=Orlando Jones under fire for tweets urging liberals to 'kill Sarah Palin' |first=Adam |last=Rathe |date=October 25, 2011 |newspaper=[[New York Daily News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He apologized for the comment several days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title = Actor Orlando Jones Asks Liberals to Kill Sarah Palin; Apologizes for 'Joke'|date = 27 October 2011|url = http://www.ibtimes.com/actor-orlando-jones-asks-liberals-kill-sarah-palin-apologizes-joke-361920|last = Gayathri|first = Amrutha|work = [[International Business Times]]|accessdate = 5 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
