'''Raymond Albert Romano''' (born December 21, 1957) is an American stand-up comedian, actor and screenwriter. He is best known for his role on the sitcom ''[[Everybody Loves Raymond]]'', for which he received an [[Emmy Award]], and as the voice of Manny in the [[Ice Age (franchise)|''Ice Age'' film series]]. He created and starred in the [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]] [[comedy-drama]] ''[[Men of a Certain Age]]'' (2009–11). From 2012 to 2015, Romano had a recurring role as Hank Rizzoli, a love interest of Sarah Braverman in ''[[Parenthood (2010 TV series)|Parenthood]]'', and co-starred in the romantic comedy ''[[The Big Sick]]'' (2017).

==Personal life and family==
Romano was born in [[Queens, New York]], the son of Lucie (née Fortini), a piano teacher, and Albert Romano (November 7, 1925 – March 11, 2010), a real estate agent and engineer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/0/Ray-Romano.html|title=Ray Romano Biography (1957–)|work=filmreference.com|accessdate=April 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Albert Romano Obituary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tributes.com/obituary/show/Albert-A.-Romano-88100334|title=Albert Romano Obituary| publisher=tributes.com| date= March 12, 2010|accessdate=March 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is of Italian descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pbs.org/wnet/pioneers-of-television/pioneering-people/ray-romano/|title=Ray Romano {{!}} Standup to Sitcom {{!}} Pioneers of Television {{!}} PBS|work=Pioneers of Television|access-date=January 11, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up in the [[Forest Hills, Queens|Forest Hills]] neighborhood of Queens.&lt;ref&gt;Strickland, Carol. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A00EFDC1F3DF932A35751C1A960958260 "Can Sitcom Make It With L.I. Setting?"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', December 1, 1996. Retrieved November 12, 2007. "For ''Everybody Loves Raymond,'' the route to Hollywood Hills began in Forest Hills, where Ray Romano, standup comedian and the star of the show, grew up."&lt;/ref&gt; He has an older brother, Richard (born in 1956), a sergeant with the [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]], and a younger brother, Robert, a [[second grade]] teacher in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://onlineathens.com/stories/050105/ent_20050501022.shtml|title=Ray Romano and his brothers see the humor in sibling rivalry – and they put it on paper|last=Critchell|first=Samantha|date=May 1, 2005|work=Online Athens|accessdate=September 6, 2013|agency=Associated Press|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015102249/http://onlineathens.com/stories/050105/ent_20050501022.shtml|archivedate=October 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Romano married his wife, Anna Scarpulla, in 1987. They met while working at a bank together.&lt;ref name=people&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.com/archive/home-truths-vol-46-no-16/|title=Home Truths|last=Gliatto|first=Tom|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]|date=October 14, 1996|accessdate=February 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have four children.

Romano's character's daughter on ''Everybody Loves Raymond'' was named after his real-life daughter. Also, in the series pilot, Ray and Debra's twin boys were named Gregory and Matthew, after Romano's real-life twin sons, but Romano felt it was inconvenient to have all his TV children have the same names as his real children, and changed the twins' names to Geoffrey and Michael on screen. He also said his brother was not pleased with [[Ray Barone]]'s TV brother.&lt;ref name=Heldenfels&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ohio.com/the330entertainment/heldenfels/mailbag-unforgettable-to-return-for-third-season-in-summer-2014-1.433679|title=Mailbag: ‘Unforgettable’ to return for third season in summer 2014|last=Heldenfels|first=Rich|work=[[Akron Beacon Journal]]|date=October 2, 2013|access-date=March 1, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015035459/http://www.ohio.com/the330entertainment/heldenfels/mailbag-unforgettable-to-return-for-third-season-in-summer-2014-1.433679|archivedate=October 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Romano's family has made various appearances in the show. Romano's real-life daughter Alexandra "Ally" Romano made several appearances on ''Everybody Loves Raymond'' as Molly, the best friend of his on-screen daughter, Ally, and the daughter of Ray Barone's nemesis, Peggy the Cookie Lady. Romano's father, Albert Romano, has made various appearances as Albert, one of Frank Barone's lodge buddies in various episodes such as "Debra at the Lodge", and "Boys' Therapy". Romano's brother, Richard Romano, appeared in the episodes "Golf For It", "Just a Formality" and "The Toaster". Romano's wife Anna appeared as one of the moms in the background at Geoffrey and Michael's school in season 6's episode titled "The Angry Family."

In February 2012, Romano revealed that his wife Anna had successfully battled [[Breast cancer classification|stage one]] [[breast cancer]] in 2010. Romano told ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' magazine that "the reason we're going public is to share our experience, yeah, but to have an effect. Our goal is to help people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.people.com/bb/newsitem.rbml?item=20568358&amp;feed=2%5Burl%3DdlUrl%5D&amp;dlUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.people.com%2Fpeople%2Fmediarss%2Fmobile%2Farticle%2F0%252C%252C20568358%252C00.xml|title=Ray Romano: My Wife Beat Breast Cancer|last=Messer|first=Lesley|date=February 8, 2012|work=People|accessdate=February 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Romano also remained close to [[Doris Roberts]], who played his character's mother on ''Everyone Loves Raymond''.  At the time of her death, Romano said he was inspired by her desire to continue learning throughout her life.  She also served as a mentor, helping him to feel more comfortable on set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.closerweekly.com/posts/ray-romano-doris-roberts-exclusive-100208|title="She Made Me": Ray Romano Credits Late Doris Roberts for Turning Him Into the Actor He is Today|publisher=closerweekly.com|date=April 27, 2016| accessdate=September 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Romano attended [[primary education|elementary]] and [[middle school]] at Our Lady Queen of Martyrs in Forest Hills. After transferring from [[Archbishop Molloy High School]], Romano graduated from [[Hillcrest High School (New York City)|Hillcrest High School]] in 1975.&lt;ref name="Yahoo Movies - Ray Romano"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800257587/bio|title=Yahoo Movies – Ray Romano|accessdate=August 23, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was in the same high school class as [[Fran Drescher]]. Before getting into show business, Romano briefly attended [[Queens College, City University of New York|Queens College]], in [[Flushing, New York]], where he studied accounting.&lt;ref name=people/&gt;

His early comedy career started when he competed in the Johnnie Walker Comedy Search in 1989 directed by ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' short film producer [[Neal Marshad]] and appeared on [[The Comedy Channel (United States)|The Comedy Channel]]. His career included many outlets, such as [[Comedy Central]], where he had been a recurring guest voice on the show ''[[Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist]]''. He also was a contestant on ''[[Star Search]]'' in the stand-up comedy category.  He originally was cast to play Joe (originally named Rick) on the American television [[Situation comedy|sitcom]] ''[[NewsRadio]]'', but was fired and replaced by [[Joe Rogan]]. He then appeared on ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' doing his stand up routine which formed his ties with [[CBS]]. Shortly thereafter, he became the star of his own show, ''[[Everybody Loves Raymond]]'' on [[CBS]], that featured a cast and format more suitable to Romano's brand of humor. His work on the series earned him six [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] nominations, winning in 2002, as well as five [[Screen Actors Guild Award]] nominations and two [[Golden Globe Award]] nominations.

Romano and his comedian best friend [[Kevin James]] starred in the [[Salesperson|salesman]] comedy ''[[Grilled (film)|Grilled]]'' as two [[Average Joe]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s of the same profession who are both desperate to land a big sale.

Romano was featured on a 2000 episode of ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire (US game show)|Who Wants to Be a Millionaire]]'', on which he won $125,000 for the [[NYPD]]'s [[Drug Abuse Resistance Education|D.A.R.E.]] unit.

In 2001, Romano was named one of [[E!]]'s top twenty entertainers of the year. That same year he was featured with his brother (a teacher at a school in Long Island) on a New York Police Department recruiting poster.

In 2004, he became the highest-paid television actor in history for his role of Raymond on [[CBS]]'s ''Everybody Loves Raymond''. It was later revealed on E! that the show had broken another record by having the highest revenue, at $3.9 billion.

On December 13, 2003, Romano was featured as a special guest star, sending a [[birthday card]] to [[Bob Barker]] in his 80th birthday bash on the 27th "Million Dollar Spectacular" special of the long-running daytime CBS series ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]''.

Romano was the subject of the documentary film ''[[95 Miles to Go]]''. The film documents Romano's road-trip for a series of rides across the south of the United States. The film was released in theaters on April 7, 2010, by [[ThinkFilm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0428196/|title=95 Miles to Go|author=gavin6942|date=October 16, 2004|publisher=IMDb|accessdate=April 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2006 Romano was interviewed in front of a live audience at [[UCLA]] by fellow stand-up veteran [[David Steinberg]], for an episode of ''[[Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg]]''. The program first aired on the [[TV Land]] network in March 2007.

Romano returned to television with a new dramedy for [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]] in 2008, ''[[Men of a Certain Age]]'', which he co-created with former ''Everybody Loves Raymond'' writer [[Mike Royce]]. It co-starred [[Scott Bakula]] and [[Andre Braugher]].

Romano made an appearance in the seventh season of [[NBC]] show ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]'' as Merv Bronte, a nervous job applicant interviewing for the job left vacant by [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]].

Romano made an appearance in the third-season premiere of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] sitcom ''[[The Middle (TV series)|The Middle]]'' as Nicky, a friend of Mike, who ruined his and Frankie's honeymoon. Romano was the second actor from ''[[Everybody Loves Raymond]]'' to be reunited with [[Patricia Heaton]] on ''The Middle''. [[Doris Roberts]] guest-starred in three episodes.

He joined the cast of ''[[Parenthood (2010 TV series)|Parenthood]]'' beginning September 11, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first= Lynette|last= Rice|title='Parenthood' scoop: Ray Romano to guest star|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2012/06/19/parenthood-scoop-ray-romano-to-guest-star/|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=June 19, 2012|accessdate=October 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mitovich|first=Matt Webb|url=http://tvline.com/2013/06/20/parenthood-season-5-ray-romano-returns-as-hank/|title=''Parenthood'': Ray Romano Books Season 5 Encore|work=[[TVLine]]|date=June 20, 2013|accessdate=June 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became a semi-regular, playing photographer Hank Rizzoli, who hired and later had a romantic relationship with [[Sarah Braverman]] and developed a friendship with her nephew who has [[Asperger syndrome]]. The role was specifically created for him after he expressed his love for the show and met with creator [[Jason Katims]] on the set of ''[[Friday Night Lights (TV series)|Friday Night Lights]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fernandez|first=Maria Elena|title=Ray Romano is happy to be playing on Team Max on 'Parenthood'|url=http://www.today.com/entertainment/ray-romano-happy-be-playing-team-max-parenthood-2D11771620|publisher=Today.com|accessdate=January 4, 2013|date=January 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Romano voiced the woolly mammoth Manfred (Manny) in the film ''[[Ice Age (2002 film)|Ice Age]]'', and its sequels ''[[Ice Age: The Meltdown]]'' in 2006, ''[[Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs]]'' in 2009, ''[[Ice Age: Continental Drift]]'' in 2012, and ''[[Ice Age: Collision Course]]'' in 2016.

Currently, Romano is a lead on the [[Epix]] comedy series ''[[Get Shorty (TV series)|Get Shorty]]''.

==Competitions==
[[File:Ray Romano at the 2010 WSOP.jpg|thumb|right|Romano at the [[2010 World Series of Poker]] main event]]
Romano competed in the [[World Series of Poker]] in [[2007 World Series of Poker|2007]], [[2008 World Series of Poker|2008]], [[2009 World Series of Poker|2009]], [[2010 World Series of Poker|2010]], [[2011 World Series of Poker|2011]], [[2013 World Series of Poker|2013]] and [[2015 World Series of Poker|2015]].

In early 2010, Romano starred in the second season of [[The Golf Channel]]'s original series ''The Haney Project'' in which [[Tiger Woods]]' former coach [[Hank Haney]] attempts to improve the golf games of different celebrities and athletes. Romano's goal was to finish the show being able to break 80.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thegolfchannel.com/tour-insider/comedian-ray-romano-star-golf-channels-hank-haney-project-series-32148/|title=Comedian Ray Romano to star in next season of Haney Project|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090927193647/http://www.thegolfchannel.com/tour-insider/comedian-ray-romano-star-golf-channels-hank-haney-project-series-32148/|archivedate=September 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Romano took time off from the show to be with his father, Albert Romano, who died in March 2010. Romano is also a regular competitor in the [[AT&amp;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am]], where he finished fifth in 2012 with his partner, Australian professional [[Steven Bowditch]]. It was the first time Romano had qualified for the final round after failing to do so on 11 successive occasions. He also competes annually in the American Century Championship, a celebrity golf tournament owned by NBC and held at [[Lake Tahoe]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfchronicle.com/sports/article/Pairings-at-the-celebrity-Tahoe-event-that-we-d-8382477.php|title=Pairings at the celebrity Tahoe event that we’d like to see|last=Saracevic|first=Al|website=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=July 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tahoesouth.com/blog/hollywood_nfl_nba_nhl_superstars_compete_like_golf_pros_for_american_centur/|title=Hollywood, National Football League, National Basketball Association, NHL superstars compete like golf pros for American Century Championship title|last=Hartley|first=Georgette|website=Lake Tahoe Blog|date=July 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; each July.
