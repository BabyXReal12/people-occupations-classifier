'''Wallace Maynard Cox''' (December 6, 1924&amp;nbsp;– February 15, 1973) was an American actor and comedian, particularly associated with the early years of [[television]] in the United States. He appeared in the U.S. television series ''[[Mister Peepers]]'' from 1952 to 1955, plus several other popular shows, and as a character actor in over 20 films.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; Cox was the voice of the animated canine superhero ''[[Underdog (TV series)|Underdog]]''. Although often cast as meek, he was actually quite athletic, as well as a military veteran. He married three times.

==Early life and education==
Cox was born on December 6, 1924, in [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; When he was 10, he moved with his divorced mother, mystery author Eleanor Blake, and a younger sister to [[Evanston, Illinois]], where he became close friends with another child in the  neighborhood, [[Marlon Brando]].&lt;ref name="When the wild one met the mild one"/&gt; His family moved frequently, eventually to Chicago, then New York City, then back to Detroit, where he graduated from [[Denby High School]].

During World War II, Cox and his family returned to New York City, where he attended [[City College of New York]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; He next spent four months in the [[United States Army]], and on his discharge attended [[New York University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anb.org/articles/18/18-03772.html Ann T. Keene. "Cox, Wally"; American National Biography Online Feb. 2000.]&lt;/ref&gt; He supported his invalid mother and sister by making and selling jewelry in a small shop and at parties, where he started doing comedy monologues. These would lead to regular performances at nightclubs, such as the [[Village Vanguard]], beginning in December 1948. He became the roommate of Marlon Brando, who encouraged him to study acting with [[Stella Adler]]. Cox and Brando remained close friends for the rest of Cox's life, and Brando appeared unannounced at Cox's wake. Brando is also reported to have kept Cox's ashes in his bedroom and conversed with them nightly.&lt;ref name="When the wild one met the mild one"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Robert W. Welkos |authorlink=Los Angeles Times |title=When the wild one met the mild one |journal=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=October 17, 2004 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2004/oct/17/entertainment/ca-brando17 |deadurl=no |accessdate=August 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
[[File:Wally Cox Lost in Space.JPG|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Cox on an episode of&lt;br&gt;''[[Lost in Space]]'' (1967)]]
In 1949, Cox appeared on the [[CBS]] network-radio show ''[[Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts]]'', to the great amusement of host Godfrey. The first half of his act was a monologue in a slangy, almost-mumbled punk-kid characterization, telling listeners about his friend Dufo: "What a crazy guy." The gullible oaf Dufo would take any dares and fall for his gang's pranks time after time, and Cox would recount the awful consequences: "Sixteen stitches. What a crazy guy." Cox's decidedly different standup routine was infectious in its ridiculousness, and just as the studio audience had reached a peak of laughter, Cox suddenly switched gears, changed characters, and sang a high-pitched version of "The Drunkard Song" ("There Is a Tavern in the Town") punctuated by eccentric [[yodel]]s. "Wallace Cox" earned a big hand that night, but lost by a narrow margin to [[The Chordettes]], but he made enough of a hit to record his radio routine for an [[RCA Victor]] single. The "Dufo" routine ("What a Crazy Guy") was paired with "Tavern in the Town."&lt;ref&gt;[[Mad (magazine)|MAD]] even animated the Dufo routine for its December 1957 issue; it is missing from the CD and DVD collections, but can be found at http://www.madcoversite.com/missing_dufo.html.&lt;/ref&gt;
He appeared in Broadway musical reviews, night clubs, and early television comedy-variety programs between 1949 and 1951, including the short-lived (January–April 1949) [[DuMont Television Network|DuMont]] series ''[[The School House]]'' and [[CBS Television]]'s ''[[Faye Emerson's Wonderful Town]]'' starring [[Faye Emerson]]. Cox had a huge impact in 1951 with a starring role as a well-meaning but ineffective policeman on ''[[Philco Television Playhouse]]''. Producer Fred Coe approached Cox about a starring role in a proposed live television sitcom, ''[[Mister Peepers]]'', which he accepted. The show ran on [[NBC television|NBC Television]] for three years. During this time, he guest-starred on NBC's ''[[The Martha Raye Show]]''. In 1959, Cox was featured in the guest-starring title role in ''The Vincent Eaglewood Story'' on NBC's [[Western (genre)|Western]] series, ''[[Wagon Train]]'', with [[Read Morgan]]. Cox played a prominent supporting role as Preacher Goodman in the [[Earl Hamner]] novel brought to the screen, ''[[Spencer's Mountain]]'' (1963). Cox played the role of a Navy sonar man in ''[[The Bedford Incident]]'' (1964) and the role of a drug-addicted doctor opposite Brando in the World War II suspense film, ''[[Morituri (1965 film)|Morituri]]'' (1965).

Other roles were as the hero of ''[[The Adventures of Hiram Holliday]]'', based on a series of [[Short story|short stories]] by [[Paul Gallico]] and co-starring with [[Ainslie Pryor]]. He was a regular occupant of the upper left square on the television game show ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'', and voiced the animated cartoon character [[Underdog (TV series)|''Underdog'']].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cartoonician.com/whatever-happened-to-total-television-productions/ "Whatever Happened to Total TeleVision productions?," ''Hogan's Alley'' #15, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=la-time-voice&gt;{{cite news|last1=King|first1=Susan|title=The 'Dog Days Return|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-06-21/news/tv-1171_1_dog-days|accessdate=March 29, 2015|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=June 21, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also was a guest on the game show ''[[What's My Line?]]'' and on the [[Television pilot|pilot]] episodes of ''[[Mission: Impossible]]'' and ''[[It Takes a Thief (1968 TV series)|It Takes a Thief]]''. Cox made several appearances on ''[[Here's Lucy]]'', as well as ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'', ''[[Lost in Space]]'', ''[[I Spy (1965 TV series)|I Spy]]'', and evening talk shows. He played a pickpocket in an episode of ''[[Car 54, Where Are You?]]''. He also appeared on ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'', season five, episode number 140, titled "[[From Agnes—With Love]]".

He played character roles in more than 20 motion pictures and worked frequently in guest-star roles in television drama, comedy, and variety series in the 1960s and early 1970s. These include a supporting role in the [[20th Century Fox]]´s unfinished film ''[[Something's Got to Give]]'' (1962), the last film of [[Marilyn Monroe]]. He was cast in a role as a down-on-his-luck prospector seeking a better life for his family in an episode of ''[[Alias Smith and Jones]]'', a Western comedy, and ''Up Your Teddy Bear'' (aka ''Mother'') (1970) in which he starred with [[Julie Newmar]]. His television and screen persona was that of a shy, timid, but kind man who wore thick eyeglasses and spoke in a pedantic, high-pitched voice.

Cox wrote a number of books, including ''Mister Peepers'', a novel created by adapting several scripts from the television series; ''My Life as a Small Boy'', an idealized depiction of his childhood; a parody and update of [[Horatio Alger]] in ''Ralph Makes Good'', which was probably originally a screen treatment for an unmade film intended to star Cox; and a children's book, ''The Tenth Life of Osiris Oakes''.

==Personal life==
In a 1950s article on Cox's ''Mister Peepers'' TV show, ''[[Popular Science]]''  reported that Cox kept a small workshop in his dressing room. (Cox's ''Hollywood Squares'' colleague, former ''Hollywood Squares'' "square-master" [[Peter Marshall (entertainer)|Peter Marshall]], recalled in his memoir, ''Backstage With The Original Hollywood Square'', that Cox installed and maintained all the wiring in his own home.) Such misperceptions no doubt contributed to the sarcastic and peevish personality that Cox displayed as a comedian; they might also have helped inspire the character of Underdog, whose "Shoe-Shine Boy" persona, in the animated cartoons, reflected the kinds of roles Cox was often given.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

TV viewers did, however, get to see a glimpse of Cox's physicality on an episode of ''[[I've Got a Secret]]'' transmitted on May 11, 1960, in which he and host [[Garry Moore]] ran around on stage assembling furniture while the panel was blindfolded. On the May 15, 1974, installment of ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson|The Tonight Show]]'', actor [[Robert Blake (actor)|Robert Blake]] spoke of how much he missed his good friend Cox, who was described as being adventuresome and athletic. Cox married three times, to Marilyn Gennaro, Milagros Tirado, and Patricia Tiernan, and was survived by his third wife and his two children.&lt;ref name="When the wild one met the mild one"/&gt;

His close friendship with Marlon Brando was the subject of rumors. Brando told a journalist: "If Wally had been a woman, I would have married him and we would have lived happily ever after",&lt;ref&gt;Sellers, Robert ''Hollywood Hellraisers: The Wild Lives and Fast Times of Marlon Brando'', Herman Graff Skyhorse Publishing 2010, p109&lt;/ref&gt; and writer/editor [[Beauregard Houston-Montgomery]] said that while high on marijuana Brando said to him that Cox had been the love of his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Saban, Stephen |title=Brando Sucks |publisher=World Of Wonder |date=February 2, 2006 |url=http://worldofwonder.net/brando-sucks/ |deadurl=no |accessdate=August 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, two of Cox's wives dismissed the suggestion that the love was more than platonic.&lt;ref name="When the wild one met the mild one"/&gt;

==Death==
Cox was 48 years old when he died of a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] on February 15, 1973, in his [[Hollywood, California]], home.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news |title=Wally Cox, TV Mr. Peepers, Dies at 48.
