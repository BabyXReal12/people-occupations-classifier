'''Ruth Ann Buzzi''' (born July 24, 1936) is an American [[actress]], [[comedian]] and [[singer]]. She has appeared onstage, as well as in films and television. She is best known for her performances on the comedy-[[variety show]] ''[[Rowan &amp; Martin's Laugh-In]]'' from 1968–73, for which she won a [[30th Golden Globe Awards#Best Supporting Actress 2|Golden Globe Award]] and received five [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] nominations.

==Early life==
{{BLP sources section|date=January 2017}}
Buzzi was born at Westerly Hospital, [[Westerly, Rhode Island]], the daughter of Rena Pauline and Angelo Peter Buzzi, a nationally recognized stone sculptor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.filmreference.com/film/88/Ruth-Buzzi.html|title= Ruth Buzzi profile|website= FilmReference.com|accessdate=January 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Riggs, Thomas. [https://books.google.com/books?id=bOJkAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Rena+Pauline+Angelo+Peter+Buzzi&amp;dq=Rena+Pauline+Angelo+Peter+Buzzi&amp;hl=en ''Contemporary Theatre, Film and Television''], Cengage Gale, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; She was raised in [[Stonington, Connecticut|Wequetequock, Connecticut]], in a rock house overlooking the ocean at Wequetequock Cove, where her father owned Buzzi Memorials, a business still operated by her older brother, Harold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=White|first1=Brooke Constance|title=New Buzzi Memorials owner to carry on tradition of craftsmanship|url=http://www.thewesterlysun.com/home/9317880-154/new-buzzi-memorials-owner-to-carry-on-tradition-of-craftsmanship.html|accessdate=July 24, 2017|work=The Westerly Sun|date=September 12, 2016|quote=The business, which his father established in 1933, is well known locally for its iconic "Buzzi Memorials" billboard sign seen from Route 1. Many also recognize the name because Harold’s younger sister is the famous comedian and actress Ruth Buzzi, who starred on "Laugh In."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her father was born in [[Arzo]], [[Switzerland]], in the [[Italian language|Italian]]-speaking [[Cantons of Switzerland|canton]] of [[Ticino]]. He carved the [[Pennsylvania Station (1910–1963)|marble eagles]] at [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|Penn Station]] in New York, the granite [[Leif Erikson]] memorial in [[Providence, Rhode Island]], the animals seen in relief on the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in [[New York City]], and made thousands of tombstones. He was asked to work on the carving of the Presidents on [[Mount Rushmore]] but declined, out of a [[Acrophobia|fear of heights]]. Her mother was born in the United States to immigrants from northern Italy.

Buzzi attended [[Stonington High School]], where she was head [[cheerleader]]. At 17, she enrolled at the [[Pasadena Playhouse]] for the Performing Arts and graduated with honors. She studied voice, dance, and acting, and took courses in [[cosmetology]]. {{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

==Career==
{{BLP sources section|date=January 2017}}

===Early successes===
Before graduation from college, Buzzi was already a working actress with a union card in musical and comedy revues.  Her first job in show business was at 19, traveling with singer [[Rudy Vallee]] in a live musical and comedy act during her summer break from college; it allowed her to graduate with a treasured union card with [[Actors' Equity Association]].  She moved to New York City after graduation and was hired immediately for a lead role in an [[off-Broadway]] musical revue, the first of 19 in which she performed across the East Coast.

In musical and comedy revues from [[Provincetown, Massachusetts]], to the [[Catskill Mountains|Catskills]] of New York, to off-Broadway, she worked alongside other young, talented performers just beginning their careers at the time, including [[Barbra Streisand]], [[Joan Rivers]], [[Dom DeLuise]], [[Bernadette Peters]] and [[Carol Burnett]]. Buzzi performed in New York musical variety shows, and she made numerous television commercials, some of which won national awards including the [[Clio Awards|Clio Award]].

Her first national recognition on television came on ''[[The Garry Moore Show]]'' in 1964,&lt;ref name=IMDB&gt;{{IMDb name|125651}}&lt;/ref&gt; just after [[Carol Burnett]] was replaced by [[Dorothy Loudon]] on the series. Buzzi saw her first taste of national fame as "Shagundala the Silent", a bumbling magician's assistant to her comedy partner [[Dom DeLuise]] who played "Dominic the Great". Buzzi was a member of the regular [[repertory]] company on the [[CBS]] variety show ''[[The Entertainers]]'' (1964–65). In 1966–67, Buzzi appeared in ''[[Sweet Charity]]'', with Fosse's wife, [[Gwen Verdon]], in the original cast. She had several small roles, one of them "the Singing Fairy".{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

===On ''Laugh-In'' and related work===
In the late 1960s, Ruth Buzzi appeared in every episode of ''[[The Steve Allen Show]]'', a comedy-variety series starring [[Steve Allen]]. Her character parts in the Allen sketches led her to be cast for [[NBC]]'s new show ''[[Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In]]''. She was the only featured player to appear in every episode of ''Laugh-In'' including the [[television pilot|pilot]] for the show and the ''Laugh-In'' television special.

A versatile comedian and accomplished singer, Buzzi played everything from dowdy old women to tipsy drunks, from Southern belles to flashy [[prostitution|hookers]]. Among her recurring characters on ''Laugh-In'' were Busy-Buzzi, a [[Hedda Hopper]]-type Hollywood gossip columnist; Doris Swizzler, a cocktail-lounge habituée who always got riotously smashed with husband Leonard (Dick Martin); and one of the Burbank Airlines Stewardesses, teaming with [[Debbie Reynolds]] as two totally inconsiderate flight attendants. Her most famous character was dowdy [[spinster]] Gladys Ormphby, clad in drab brown with her bun hairdo covered by a visible hairnet knotted in the middle of her forehead. Buzzi first used this look when she played Agnes Gooch in a school production of ''[[Auntie Mame]]''. In most sketches, she used her lethal purse, with which she would flail away vigorously at anyone who incurred her wrath.

On ''Laugh-In'', Gladys most often appeared as the unwilling object of the advances of [[Arte Johnson]]'s "dirty old man" character Tyrone F. Horneigh. In a typical exchange, Tyrone accosts Gladys and asks, "Do you believe in the hereafter?"  "Of course I do!" Gladys retorts defensively. Delighted, Tyrone shoots back: "Then you know what I'm ''here'' after!" NBC collectively called these two characters ''The Nitwits'' when they went to animation in the mid-1970s as part of the series ''[[Baggy Pants and the Nitwits]]''. Buzzi and Johnson both voiced their respective roles in the cartoon.

Buzzi, as Gladys, was featured in most of the [[Dean Martin]] Roasts from the MGM Hotel in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]]. Memorable shows included her intense comedic dialogue, ranting about notable roastees including [[Muhammad Ali]], [[Frank Sinatra]], and [[Lucille Ball]], to name a few. In each case, Gladys Ormphby pugnaciously attacked the honoree with her flailing purse to the screams and howls of the Las Vegas audience. Martin would also suffer Gladys's purse assaults for his remarks about her unappealing looks and poor romantic prospects. In one such exchange, Gladys accusingly questioned Martin about who had been chasing her around a hotel room in the wee hours; Martin's response ("The exterminator!") earned him a beating as he broke up laughing along with the audience. Gladys then declared to the audience that, when Martin and other men looked at her, only one thing came to their minds. Martin, still laughing, could barely get out the answer: "Rabies!" This earned him an even fiercer beating from Gladys.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

===Continued success on television===
{{BLP sources section|date=February 2017}}
Buzzi was featured as a semi-regular on the sitcom ''[[That Girl]]'' as [[Marlo Thomas]]'s friend Pete Peterson.&lt;ref name=IMDB/&gt; She starred with [[Jim Nabors]] as the time-traveling [[android (robot)|android]]s Fi and Fum in ''[[The Lost Saucer]]'' produced by [[Sid and Marty Krofft]] which aired from September 11, 1975 until September 2, 1976 (16 episodes).

Buzzi also guested as Chloe, the theretofore unseen but oft-mentioned wife of phone company worker Henry Beesmeyer ([[Marvin Kaplan]]), on ''[[Alice (TV series)|Alice]]'' in 1981. She was also a guest star on the syndicated sitcom ''[[Down to Earth (US TV series)|Down to Earth]]'' in 1985. [[Dean Martin]]'s producer, Greg Garrison, obviously enjoyed Buzzi's work as a comedy sketch artist and hired her for his comedy specials starring [[Dom DeLuise]]. She charted the single "You Oughta Hear The Song" in 1977. It reached #90 on [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard's]] national Country Music chart.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Buzzi was a guest star on many television series including ''[[Donny &amp; Marie (1976 TV series)|Donny &amp; Marie]]'', ''[[The Flip Wilson Show]]'', ''The [[Dean Martin]] Music and Comedy Hour'', the [[Dean Martin]] Roasts, ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]'', ''[[Tony Orlando and Dawn]]'', ''[[The Monkees (TV series)|The Monkees]]'', ''[[Emergency!]]'', and variety series hosted by [[Leslie Uggams]] and by [[Glen Campbell]]. She also appeared occasionally on game shows and was a celebrity judge on ''[[The Gong Show]]''. She appeared on [[Lucille Ball]]'s last (but short-lived) sitcom, ''[[Life with Lucy]]'', as Mrs. Wilcox in the episode "Lucy Makes a Hit with John Ritter". She appeared eight times on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' and has made more than 200 other television guest appearances.&lt;ref name=IMDB/&gt;

Buzzi is an accomplished [[voice actress]]. She voiced the character Nose Marie in the [[Hanna-Barbera]] animated series ''[[Pound Puppies (1986 TV series)|Pound Puppies]]'' (1986). She also voiced Mama Bear in ''[[The Berenstain Bears (1985 TV series)|Berenstain Bears]]'' (1985) and performed hundreds of guest voices for many other cartoon series, including ''[[The Smurfs (TV series)|The Smurfs]]'', ''[[The Angry Beavers]]'' and [[Mo Willems]]' ''[[Sheep in the Big City]]''.&lt;ref name=IMDB/&gt;

She appeared frequently on ''[[Sesame Street]]'' in comedy sketch clips from her six years on that show, and is often heard as the voice of outlandish failed [[torch song|torch singer]] Suzie Kabloozie. While she was a regular performer on ''Sesame Street'', she was nominated for an Emmy Award for her work as Ruthie, a shopkeeper.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Buzzi performed in numerous national television commercials, most notably for [[Clorox|Clorox 2]], [[Clairol]], [[Mum (deodorant)|Ban roll-on deodorant]], and [[Santa Anita Raceway]], and voicing Granny Goodwitch in television commercials for [[Sugar Crisp]] cereal. She originated the Goodwitch character in the animated TV series ''[[Linus the Lionhearted|Linus! The Lion Hearted]]'' (1964–65).&lt;ref name=IMDB/&gt;

Buzzi appeared in the [["Weird Al" Yankovic]] video "[[Gump (song)|Gump]]" and similarly appeared in other music videos with the rock groups [[B-52's]] and [[The Presidents of the United States of America (band)|The Presidents of the United States of America]]. She appeared on ''[[Saved by the Bell]]'' (playing Screech Powers's wacky Elvis fanatic mother), ''[[The Muppet Show]]'', ''[[You Can't Do That on Television]]'' (during its [[CTV Television Network|CTV]]-produced incarnation ''Whatever Turns You On''), and numerous other television shows. She played the role of the eccentric Nurse Kravitz on NBC's daytime soap opera ''[[Passions]]''. In 2006 and 2007, she made guest appearances on the children's TV series ''[[Come on Over (TV series)|Come on Over]]''.&lt;ref name=IMDB/&gt;

Buzzi had a successful nightclub act across the United States, including at [[Las Vegas]]'s [[Sahara Hotel|Sahara]] and at the [[MGM Grand Hotel and Casino|MGM Grand]] hotels. She performed the act for one year. Her shows all sold out and she was reportedly offered an extended stay but declined.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

She had featured roles in more than 20 feature films, including ''[[Chu Chu and the Philly Flash]]'', ''[[Freaky Friday (1976 film)|Freaky Friday]]'', ''[[The North Avenue Irregulars]]'', ''[[The Apple Dumpling Gang Rides Again]]'', ''[[The Villain (1979 film)|The Villain]]'', ''[[The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland]]'' and a number of westerns for the European market known as the [[Lucky Luke]] series in which she plays the mother of the [[Dalton Gang]].&lt;ref name=IMDB/&gt;
