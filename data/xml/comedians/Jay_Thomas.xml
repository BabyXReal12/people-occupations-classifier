'''Jay Thomas''' (born '''Jon Thomas Terrell''';&lt;ref name="Elber"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Elber|first1=Lynn|title=Jay Thomas, 'Murphy Brown' and 'Cheers' actor, radio host, dies at 69|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/tv/ct-jay-thomas-dead-20170824-story.html|accessdate=August 26, 2017|work=Chicago Tribune|agency=Associated Press|date=August 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; July 12, 1948 – August 24, 2017) was an American actor, comedian, and radio personality. He was heard in New York from 1976-79 on [[Top 40]] station [[WEPN-FM|99X]], and later on [[Rhythmic CHR]] station [[WKTU]], and in Los Angeles beginning in 1986 on [[KPWR]] "Power 106", where he hosted the station's top-rated morning show until 1993. His notable television work included his co-starring role as Remo DaVinci on ''[[Mork &amp; Mindy]]'' (1979–81), the recurring role of Eddie LeBec, a [[Boston Bruins]] [[goaltender|goalie]] on the downside of his career, on ''[[Cheers]]'' (1987–89), the lead character of newspaper columnist Jack Stein on ''[[Love &amp; War (TV series)|Love &amp; War]]'' (1992–95), and a repeat guest role as Jerry Gold, a talk show host who becomes both an antagonist and love interest of the title character on ''[[Murphy Brown]]''. He won the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series]] in 1990 and 1991 for portraying Gold.

In 1997, he starred in the television film ''[[Killing Mr. Griffin (film)|Killing Mr. Griffin]]'', based on [[Killing Mr. Griffin|the eponymous novel]]. In film, he co-starred in ''[[Mr. Holland's Opus]]'' as a high school coach with a flair for theatricals, and portrayed the [[Easter Bunny]] in ''[[The Santa Clause 2]]'' and ''[[The Santa Clause 3]]''. He was also an annual guest on ''[[The Late Show with David Letterman]]'' during the Christmas season, where he told a story about how he met [[Clayton Moore]], who portrayed the title character on ''[[The Lone Ranger (TV series)|The Lone Ranger]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://animalnewyork.com/2009/its-wouldnt-be-the-holidays-without-jay-thomas-lone-ranger-story|title=It's Wouldn't Be the Holidays Without Jay Thomas' Lone Ranger Story|publisher=Animalnewyork.com|accessdate=2014-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 2005, he hosted ''The Jay Thomas Show'' on [[SiriusXM Satellite Radio]], which aired every Friday afternoon on Howard 101.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siriusxm.com/talk&amp;entertainment|title=Talk and Entertainment - Program Schedule - SiriusXM Radio|last=|first=|date=|website=Siriusxm.com|access-date=2017-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and education ==

Thomas was born in [[Kermit, Texas]], to Katharine ([[married and maiden names|née]] Guzzino) and Timothy Harry Terrell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/3/Jay-Thomas.html|title=Jay Thomas profile|website=Filmreference.com|accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was raised in his [[Italian American]] mother's [[Catholic]] religion; his father was [[Protestant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/sptimes/access/54275216.html?dids=54275216:54275216&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Sep+28%2C+1992&amp;author=JERRY+BUCK&amp;pub=St.+Petersburg+Times&amp;desc=Thomas+hopes+%60Love'+will+pave+road&amp;pqatl=google|title=Thomas hopes `Love' will pave road |publisher=Pqasb.pqarchiver.com|date=1992-09-28|accessdate=2014-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas was raised in [[New Orleans]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.experienceneworleans.com/people.html|title=Famous People from New Orleans|publisher=Experience New Orleans|accessdate=2014-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he attended and graduated from [[Jesuit High School (New Orleans)|Jesuit High School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/jarettwieselman/the-whole-veronica-mars-gang-is-coming-back-for-a-new-webser|title=The Whole "Veronica Mars" Gang Is Coming Back for a New Web Series|work=[[BuzzFeed]]|accessdate=September 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Letterman appearances==
Thomas made his annual Christmastime appearance with [[David Letterman]] for the first time in December 1998. Letterman and one of his other guests that evening, then-[[New York Jets]] quarterback [[Vinny Testaverde]], took turns tossing footballs at the [[Christmas tree]] across the stage, atop which sat a large [[meatball]]. As the two tried to knock off the meatball and failed repeatedly, Thomas came back out to join in the festivities, and knocked the meatball off of the tree.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; (Thomas had played quarterback on his college football team.)

When Letterman talked with Thomas later in the show, Thomas told a story about when he was a young [[disc jockey]] at [[WFNZ|WAYS]] 610AM&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFabfnfhIaY|title=Jay Thomas on Letterman.2009.12.23 - The 'Lone Ranger' Story|first=|last=Laurent Bodson|date=31 December 2009|publisher=|via=[[YouTube]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]]. Thomas had been making a promotional appearance at a local [[Dodge]] dealership which had also booked [[Clayton Moore]] to make an appearance, dressed in his [[Lone Ranger]] costume.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nola.com/tv/index.ssf/2014/12/jay_thomas_takes_one_more_shot.html|title=Jay Thomas takes one more shot at David Letterman's Christmas-tree meatball|website=NOLA.com|date=2014-12-18|accessdate=2015-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the story goes, after the appearance Thomas, who at the time sported what he referred to as a "white man's [[Afro]]", and his friend, who was wearing platform shoes, tight pants, and a [[tie-dye]]d shirt, went off to get "herbed up" (smoke [[marijuana]]) behind a dumpster, after the broadcast ended. When they returned to pack up their equipment, they discovered that Moore was still there, as the car that was supposed to drive him to the Red Carpet Inn on Morehead Street (some years he would say the [[Red Roof Inn]]) never arrived. Thomas offered Moore a ride in his old [[Volvo]], and Moore accepted. As they were sitting in traffic, with Moore sitting silently in the back seat, an impatient middle-aged man backed his [[Buick]] into the front end of Thomas' car, broke a headlight, and [[hit and run|drove away]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Thomas gave chase to the Buick through heavy traffic, finally caught up to the man, and confronted him about the damage. The indignant driver denied breaking the headlight, and Thomas threatened to call the police. The man said nobody would believe their story because Thomas and his friend looked like "two [[hippie]] freaks". At that moment, Thomas said that Moore, who was still in costume as the Lone Ranger, got out of the car and said to the man, "They'll believe '''me''', citizen!" The shocked perpetrator then began to cooperate.&lt;ref&gt;''Late Show'' (airdate December 19, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

For every year thereafter, with the exception of 2013, Thomas appeared to re-tell the Lone Ranger story and once again attempt what Letterman calls the "''Late Show'' Quarterback Challenge". For the final appearance of the story in 2014, Thomas was again successful in knocking the meatball off the top of the tree. Thomas missed the 2013 ''Late Show'' Christmas episode due to surgery on his throat; [[John McEnroe]] took his place and told the Lone Ranger story, then tried, unsuccessfully, to knock the meatball off the tree by hitting tennis balls at it.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

==Personal life and death==
Thomas fathered [[J. T. Harding]] in an out-of-wedlock relationship, and the child was adopted by another family in Michigan. Thomas and his son spoke about their reunion on the ''[[Dr. Phil Show]]''. Harding was the lead singer of the band JTX and is a country music songwriter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usmagazine.com/emmy-award-winning-actor-discovers-he-has-a-son|work=[[Us Weekly|US Magazine]]|title=Emmy Award-Winning Actor Discovers He Has a Son|accessdate=2008-11-28|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080815150840/http://www.usmagazine.com/emmy-award-winning-actor-discovers-he-has-a-son|archivedate=August 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas married Sally Michelson in 1987. They had two sons, Samuel and Jacob.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Genzlinger|first1=Neil|title=Jay Thomas, Actor on 'Murphy Brown' and 'Cheers,' Is Dead at 69|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/24/arts/television/jay-thomas-dead-actor-cheers-murphy-brown.html|accessdate=August 26, 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=August 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jay Thomas died of [[throat cancer]] on August 24, 2017 in [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]], [[California]] at the age of 69.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/confidential/comic-actor-jay-thomas-dead-69-article-1.3439508|title=Comic actor Jay Thomas is dead at 69|work=[[New York Daily News]]|accessdate=24 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
