He is known for his energetic [[slapstick]] performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shanlin|first=Calum|title=Throwback Thursday: Jim Carrey at 20|url=http://www.cbc.ca/live/throwback-thursday-jim-carrey-at-20.html|publisher=CBC|accessdate=April 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carrey first gained recognition in America in 1990 after landing a recurring role in the [[sketch comedy]] television series ''[[In Living Color]]''. His first leading roles in major productions came with ''[[Ace Ventura: Pet Detective]]'' (1994), ''[[Dumb and Dumber]]'' (1994), ''[[The Mask (film)|The Mask]]'' (1994), and ''[[Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls]]'' (1995), as well as a supporting role in ''[[Batman Forever]]'' (1995) and a lead role in ''[[Liar Liar]]'' (1997). He gained critical acclaim starring in serious roles in ''[[The Truman Show]]'' (1998) and ''[[Man on the Moon (film)|Man on the Moon]]'' (1999), with each garnering him a [[Golden Globe Award]] for Best Actor.

In the 2000s, he gained further popularity for his portrayal of the [[Grinch]] in ''[[How the Grinch Stole Christmas (2000 film)|How the Grinch Stole Christmas]]'' and for the comedy ''[[Me, Myself &amp; Irene]]'' (both in 2000), as well as ''[[Bruce Almighty]]'' (2003), ''[[Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind]]'' (2004) for which he was nominated for the [[BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role]], ''[[Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events]]'' (2004), ''[[Fun with Dick and Jane (2005 film)|Fun with Dick and Jane]]'' (2005), ''[[Yes Man (film)|Yes Man]]'' (2008), ''[[Horton Hears a Who!

In the 2010s, he has starred in ''[[Mr. Popper's Penguins (film)|Mr. Popper's Penguins]]'' (2011) and ''[[The Incredible Burt Wonderstone]]'' (2013). In 2013, he appeared in ''[[Kick-Ass 2 (film)|Kick-Ass 2]]'' as Colonel Stars and Stripes. He retracted support for the film two months prior to its release. He issued a statement via his Twitter account that, in light of the shootings at [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting|Sandy Hook Elementary]], "Now in all good conscience I cannot support that level of violence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etonline.com/dailyfirst/135434_Jim_Carrey_Bashes_Kick_Ass_2_For_Being_Violent/index.html|title=Jim Carrey Bashes 'Kick-Ass 2' For Its Violence|publisher=ET Online|author=WILLIS,JACKIE|date=June 24, 2013|accessdate=August 19, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130827101241/http://www.etonline.com/dailyfirst/135434_Jim_Carrey_Bashes_Kick_Ass_2_For_Being_Violent/index.html|archivedate=August 27, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carrey reprised his role as Lloyd Christmas in ''[[Dumb and Dumber To]]'' (2014).&lt;ref name="dumber2-march2013"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.accesshollywood.com/jim-carrey-dumb-and-dumber-sequel-happening-hopefully-next-year_article_76557 | title=Jim Carrey: Dumb &amp; Dumber Sequel Happening 'Hopefully Next Year' | publisher=Access Hollywood | date=March 12, 2013 | accessdate=March 14, 2013 | author=Spero, Jesse}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Dumb and Dumber To' filming starts in Atlanta on Monday|url=http://www.onlocationvacations.com/2013/09/19/dumb-and-dumber-to-filming-starts-in-atlanta-on-monday/|publisher=OLV|accessdate=October 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Dumb And Dumber To' Release Date Set For Nov. 14, 2014|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/19/dumb-and-dumber-to-release-date_n_4301763.html?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000592|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=January 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Carrey was born in [[Newmarket, Ontario]], Canada,&lt;ref name=cbcbirth /&gt; to Kathleen (née Oram), a homemaker, and Percy Carrey, a musician and accountant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usaweekend.com/03_issues/030525/030525carrey.html |title=USA WEEKEND Magazine |work=USA Weekend |date=May 25, 2003 |accessdate=November 21, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/1/Jim-Carrey.html |title=Jim Carrey Biography (1962–) |publisher=Filmreference.com |accessdate=November 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was raised a Roman Catholic and has three older siblings: John, Patricia, and Rita.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Puig |first=Claudia |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/2003-05-20-carrey_x.htm |title=Spiritual Carrey still mighty funny |work=USA Today |date=May 27, 2003 |accessdate=November 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.movieline.com/1994/07/carreyd-away.php?page=3 |title=Jim Carrey: Carrey'd Away |publisher=[[Movieline]] |date=January 7, 1994 |accessdate=October 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother was of French, Irish, and Scottish descent and his father was of French-Canadian ancestry (the family's original surname was ''Carré'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jimcarreyonline.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=75657&amp;sid=c288b4a04f1da0728280242f21ef58de |title=Jim Carrey Online • View topic&amp;nbsp;– Scottish Interview &amp; Clip |publisher=Jimcarreyonline.com |accessdate=February 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stated"&gt;{{YouTube|cpEfiRUu64Q|Stated}}{{dead link|date=August 2014}} on ''[[Inside the Actors Studio]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="book"&gt;{{cite book | author = Knelman, Martin. | title=Jim Carrey: The Joker Is Wild (2000) | publisher=U.S.: Firefly Books Ltd. | page = 8 | isbn = 1-55209-535-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At age 10, Carrey wrote a letter to [[Carol Burnett]] of the ''[[Carol Burnett Show]]'' pointing out that he was already a master of [[Impressionist (entertainment)|impressions]] and should be considered for a role on the show; he was overjoyed when he received a [[form letter]] reply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comediansincarsgettingcoffee.com/jim-carrey-we-love-breathing-what-youre-burning-baby|publisher=Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee|first=Jerry|last=Seinfeld|year=2016|title=Jim Carry: We Love Breathing What You're Burning Baby|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160512035503/http://comediansincarsgettingcoffee.com/jim-carrey-we-love-breathing-what-youre-burning-baby|archivedate=May 12, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carrey lived in [[Burlington, Ontario|Burlington]], Ontario, for eight years, and attended [[Aldershot School|Aldershot High School]]. In a ''[[Hamilton Spectator]]'' interview (February 2007), Carrey said, "If my career in show business hadn't panned out I would probably be working today in [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]], Ontario, at the [[Dofasco]] steel mill." When looking across the Burlington Bay toward Hamilton, he could see the mills and thought, "Those were where the great jobs were."&lt;ref name=JIMSTEEL&gt;{{Cite news| last=Holt|first=Jim|title=Its all in the numbers: Jim Carrey could be at Dofasco if Hollywood hadn't worked out|newspaper=The Hamilton Spectator|pages=Go14|date=February 26, 2007| postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Early work===
While Carrey was struggling to obtain work and make a name for himself, his father tried to help the young comedian put together a stage act, driving him to [[Toronto]] to debut at [[comedy club]] [[Yuk Yuk's]].&lt;ref name="ref94"&gt;{{cite web|title=Jim Carrey Biography |url=http://94.236.123.155:8082/biographies/jim-carrey.html |work=Bio |publisher=Bio |accessdate=April 26, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130725203210/http://94.236.123.155:8082/biographies/jim-carrey.html |archivedate=July 25, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Carrey's impersonations bombed and this gave him doubts about his capabilities as a professional entertainer. His family's financial struggles made it difficult for them to support Carrey's ambitions.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Eventually, the family's financial problems were resolved and they moved into a new home.&lt;ref name="ref94" /&gt; With more domestic stability, Carrey returned to the stage with a more polished act. In a short period of time, he went from open-mic nights to regular paid shows, building his reputation in the process. A reviewer in the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' raved that Carrey was "a genuine star coming to life".&lt;ref&gt;"Up, up goes a new comic star", Bruce Blackadar, ''[[Toronto Star]]'', February 27, 1981, p. C1.&lt;/ref&gt; Carrey was soon noticed by comedian [[Rodney Dangerfield]], who signed the young comic to open his tour performances. Dangerfield eventually brought Carrey to Las Vegas. However, Carrey soon decided to move to Hollywood, where he began performing at [[The Comedy Store]] and, in 1982, appeared on the televised stand-up show ''[[The Improv|An Evening at the Improv]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An Evening at the Improv|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0401003/fullcredits|work=IMDB|publisher=IMDB|accessdate=April 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, he debuted his act on ''[[The Tonight Show]]''.&lt;ref name="cbsnews"&gt;{{cite news|last=Leung|first=Rebecca|title=Carrey: 'Life Is Too Beautiful'|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-18560_162-656547.html|work=CBS News|accessdate=April 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his increasing popularity as a stand-up comic, Carrey turned his attention to the film and television industries, auditioning to be a cast member for the [[Saturday Night Live (season 6)|1980–81 season]] of [[NBC]]'s ''[[Saturday Night Live]].'' Carrey was not selected for the position, although he later hosted the show in [[Saturday Night Live (season 21)|May 1996]], [[Saturday Night Live (season 36)|January 2011]], and [[Saturday Night Live (season 40)|October 2014]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McGlynn|first=Katla|title=Jim Carrey Spoofs 'Black Swan' on 'SNL'|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/01/09/jim-carrey-black-swan_n_806425.html|work=Huffington Post|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=April 25, 2012|date=January 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Elizabeth Barber|title=Jim Carrey Is Booked to Host Saturday Night Live on Oct. 25|url=http://time.com/3501079/jim-carrey-booked-host-october-25-snl-saturday-night-live/|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate=December 10, 2014|date=October 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, Carrey was in the short-lived sitcom ''[[The Duck Factory]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0086702|The Duck Factory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1990 to 1994, Carrey was a regular cast member of the ensemble comedy television series ''[[In Living Color]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tvovermind.com/tv-news/top-5-jim-carrey-characters-living-color|title=The Top 5 Jim Carrey Characters from In Living Color|date=2017-06-13|work=TVOvermind|access-date=2018-01-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1994–1997: Rise to fame===
1994 was a break-out year for Carrey. He was cast in the lead roles in ''[[Ace Ventura: Pet Detective]]'', ''[[The Mask (film)|The Mask]]'' and ''[[Dumb and Dumber]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Ebert| first = Roger| authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Mask| work = | publisher = rogerebert.com| date = July 29, 1994| url = http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19940729/REVIEWS/407290304/1023| format =| doi = | accessdate =August 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dumb and Dumber'' was a commercial success, grossing over $270 million worldwide,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE6D6153BF930A35752C0A963958260 | work=The New York Times | title='Dumb and Dumber' Tops Holiday Film Grosses | first=Bernard | last=Weinraub | date=January 3, 1995 | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received his first [[Golden Globe Award]] nomination for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor&amp;nbsp;– Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Best Actor]] for his work in ''The Mask''.

[[File:Jim-Carrey-2008.jpg|thumb|Carrey in [[Madrid]], Spain, on December 13, 2008]]

In 1995, Carrey co-starred in the [[Joel Schumacher]]-directed [[superhero film]] ''[[Batman Forever]]'', in which [[Batman]] tries to stop [[Two-Face]] and the [[Riddler]] (played by Carrey) in their villainous scheme to drain information from all the brains in [[Gotham City]]. The feature received poor reviews, with most criticism aimed at the movie's "blatant [[commercialism]]", as characterized by [[Peter Travers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = [[Peter Travers]] | url = https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/5948895/review/5948896/batman_forever | title = Batman Forever | work = [[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]] | date = December 8, 2000 | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In that same year, Carrey reprised his role as [[Ace Ventura]] in ''[[Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls]]''. Like the original film, it was well received by the public, but heavily criticised by critics. It was a huge box-office success, earning $212 million worldwide in addition to breaking records, with a $40 million opening weekend.&lt;ref name="mojo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=aceventura2.htm |title=Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls (1995) |publisher=Box Office Mojo |date=March 2, 1996 |accessdate=May 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carrey earned $20 million for his next film, ''[[The Cable Guy]]'' (1996). Directed by [[Ben Stiller]], the film was a [[satire|satirical]] [[black comedy]], in which Carrey played a lonely, menacing cable TV installer who infiltrates the life of one of his customers (played by [[Matthew Broderick]]). The role was a departure from the "hapless, hyper, overconfident" characters he had been known for. However, it did not fare well with most critics, many reacting to Carrey's change of tone from previous films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/cable_guy |title=The Cable Guy&amp;nbsp;– Movie Reviews, Trailers, Pictures |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |date= |accessdate=March 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carrey also starred in the music video of the film's closing song, "[[Leave Me Alone (Jerry Cantrell song)|Leave Me Alone]]" by [[Jerry Cantrell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQExlqz6slk |title=Jerry Cantrell - Leave Me Alone |website=YouTube |access-date=July 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the reviews, ''The Cable Guy'' grossed $102 million worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=cableguy.htm |title=The Cable Guy (1996) |publisher=Boxofficemojo.com |date=August 30, 1996 |accessdate=March 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He soon bounced back in 1997 with the critically acclaimed comedy ''[[Liar Liar]]'', playing Fletcher Reede, a successful lawyer who has built his career on lying, regularly breaking promises that he makes to his son, Max. Max soon makes a birthday wish that for just that one day, his dad would not be able to lie. Carrey was praised for his performance, earning a second Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actor. [[Janet Maslin]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said, "Well into his tumultuous career, Mr. Carrey finally turns up in a straightforward comic vehicle, and the results are much wilder and funnier than this mundane material should have allowed."&lt;ref&gt;Maslin, Janet.

Retrieved April 26, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1998–2006: Critical acclaim===
The following year he decided to take a pay cut to play the serious role of [[The Truman Show|Truman Burbank]] in the satirical [[comedy-drama]] film ''[[The Truman Show]]'' (1998).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/truman_show/ |title=The Truman Show Movie Reviews, Pictures |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=November 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was highly praised and brought Carrey further international acclaim, leading many to believe he would be nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Oscar]].&lt;ref name="pro"&gt;{{cite news | author = Svetkey, Benjamin | title = The Truman Pro | publisher = ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' | date = June 5, 1998 | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,283442,00.html | accessdate=March 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, he did pick up his first Golden Globe Award for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Drama|Best Actor in a Motion Picture Drama]]. ''The Truman Show'' was a commercial success also, earning $264 million worldwide against a budget of $60 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=trumanshow.htm|title=The Truman Show|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]|accessdate=March 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?view2=worldwide&amp;yr=1998&amp;p=.htm| title= 1998 Yearly Box Office Results|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]|accessdate=March 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Film4]] critic stated that the film "allows Carrey to edge away from broad comedy", adding that it was "a hilarious and breathtakingly conceived satire".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Film4 Review|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/truman_show/reviews/?type=top_critics|work=Rotten Tomatoes|publisher=Film4|accessdate=April 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That same year, Carrey appeared as a fictionalized version of himself on the final episode of [[Garry Shandling]]'s ''[[The Larry Sanders Show]]'', in which he deliberately ripped into [[Larry Sanders (character)|Shandling's character]]. In 1999, Carrey had the lead role in ''[[Man on the Moon (film)|Man on the Moon]]''. He portrayed comedian [[Andy Kaufman]] to critical acclaim and received his second Golden Globe in a row. In addition, he received his first Screen Actors Guild Award nomination for [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role|Best Actor]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1093579-man_on_the_moon/ Rotten Tomatoes&amp;nbsp;– Man on the Moon] Retrieved March 31, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Carrey reteamed with the [[Farrelly brothers]], who had previously directed him in ''Dumb and Dumber'', for the black comedy film ''[[Me, Myself &amp; Irene]]'', a film that received mixed reviews&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/me_myself_and_irene/ | title=Me, Myself &amp; Irene | publisher= [[Flixster]] | work = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] | accessdate=March 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but enjoyed box office success. Carrey played the role of state trooper Charlie Baileygates, who has [[dissociative identity disorder|multiple personalities]] and romances a woman portrayed by [[Renée Zellweger]]. That same year, Carrey starred in the second highest-grossing Christmas film of all time, ''[[How the Grinch Stole Christmas (2000 film)|How the Grinch Stole Christmas]]'', playing the [[title character]], for which he received both praise and criticism from critics alongside a Golden Globe nomination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/how_the_grinch_stole_christmas/ | title=How the Grinch Stole Christmas | publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | accessdate=March 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For his next feature film, Carrey starred opposite [[Jennifer Aniston]] and [[Morgan Freeman]] in [[Tom Shadyac]]'s international hit comedy ''[[Bruce Almighty]]'' (2003). Carrey played a TV newsman who unexpectedly receives God's [[Omnipotence|omnipotent abilities]] when the deity decides to take a vacation. The film received mixed reviews upon release&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/bruce_almighty/|title=Bruce Almighty|date=May 23, 2003|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but despite this still became a financial success, earning over $484 million worldwide, and going on to become the seventeenth highest-grossing live action comedy of all time.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web | title = Box Office Mojo&amp;nbsp;– Bruce Almighty | url = http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=brucealmighty.htm | work = [[Box Office Mojo]] | publisher = Amazon.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hollywood.com's Highest Grossing Comedy Films of All Time List|url=http://www.hollywood.com/news/Hollywoodcoms_Highest_Grossing_Comedy_Films_of_All_Time_List/3467963|publisher=[[Hollywood.com]]|accessdate=April 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Carrey starred in ''[[Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind]]''. The film received overwhelming acclaim upon release. Critics highly praised Carrey's portrayal of Joel Barish, in addition to the performance of his co-star [[Kate Winslet]], who received an Oscar nomination. According to [[CNN]]'s reviewer [[Paul Clinton]], Carrey's performance was the actor's "best, most mature and sharply focused performance ever".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2004/SHOWBIZ/Movies/03/18/review.sunshine/index.html CNN.com] "the best, most mature and sharply focused performance ever from Jim Carrey".&lt;/ref&gt; Carrey received another Golden Globe nomination and his first BAFTA Award nomination for [[BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role|Best Actor]].

Carrey's next appearance was in the 2004 black comedy fantasy film ''[[Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events]]'', which was based on the popular children's novels [[A Series of Unfortunate Events|of the same name]]. The film was positively received; [[Desson Thomson]] from ''[[The Washington Post]]'' said of Carrey's approach to the character of [[Count Olaf]],&lt;blockquote&gt;Olaf is a humorless villain in the book. He's not amusing like Carrey at all. To which I would counter: If you can't let Carrey be Carrey, put someone boring and less expensive in the role. In his various disguises he's rubbery, inventive and improvisationally inspired. I particularly liked his passing imitation of a dinosaur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|authorlink=Desson Thomson |first=Deeson |last=Thomson |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A4634-2004Dec16.html |title=A Fortunate Series of Scenes |date=April 17, 2004 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |accessdate=April 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/lemony_snicket/ |title=Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=April 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; That same year, Carrey was inducted into the [[Canadian Walk of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jim Carrey, 2004 inductee |url=http://www.canadaswalkoffame.com/inductee/jim-carrey |publisher=Canada's Walk of Fame |accessdate=September 10, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111106114251/http://canadaswalkoffame.com/inductee/jim-carrey |archivedate=November 6, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2007–present: Continued success===
In 2007, Carrey reunited with [[Joel Schumacher]], director of ''[[Batman Forever]]'', for ''[[The Number 23]]'', a psychological thriller co-starring [[Virginia Madsen]] and [[Danny Huston]]. In the film, Carrey plays a man who becomes obsessed with the [[23 enigma|number 23]], after finding a book about a man with the same obsession. The film was panned by critics. The following year Carrey provided his voice for [[Dr. Seuss]]' ''[[Horton Hears a Who! (film)|Horton Hears a Who!]]'' (2008). Carrey voiced the beloved elephant for the CGI-animated feature, which received overwhelmingly positive reviews and delivered family crowds [[en masse]]. The film was also a box office success, raking in over $290 million worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/horton-hears-a-who2008/ |title=Dr. Seuss' Horton Hears a Who |accessdate=April 14, 2008 |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that same year, Carrey returned to live-action comedy, starring opposite [[Zooey Deschanel]] and [[Bradley Cooper]] in ''[[Yes Man (film)|Yes Man]]'' (2008). Carrey played down-and-out man, Carl Allen, who had gone nowhere in life, thanks to always saying no to everything, until he signs up for a self-help program that teaches him the power of saying yes. Despite reviews being mixed, Rene Rodriquez of ''[[The Miami Herald]]'' stated, "''Yes Man'' is fine as far as Jim Carrey comedies go, but it's even better as a love story that just happens to make you laugh."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.miami.com/yes-man-pg-13-article/ | title=Miami Herald ''Yes Man'' Review | work=[[The Miami Herald]] | date=December 19, 2008 | accessdate=December 21, 2008 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090503130332/http://www.miami.com/yes-man-pg-13-article | archivedate=May 3, 2009 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film had a decent performance at the box office, earning $225 million worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=yesman.htm | title=Yes Man (2008) | publisher=[[Amazon.com]] | work=[[Box Office Mojo]] | accessdate=April 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2009, Carrey's work has included a leading role in [[Glenn Ficarra]] and [[John Requa]]'s ''[[I Love You Phillip Morris]]'', premiering in January 2009 at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] before receiving a wide release in February 2010. Carrey portrayed [[Steven Jay Russell]], a [[con artist]], imposter, and multiple prison escapee who falls in love with his fellow inmate, Phillip Morris (played by [[Ewan McGregor]]). The film received largely positive reviews, with Damon Wise of ''[[The Times]]'' giving the film four stars out of five, stating, "''I Love You Phillip Morris'' is an extraordinary film that serves as a reminder of just how good Carrey can be when he's not tied into a generic Hollywood crowd-pleaser. His comic timing remains as exquisite as ever."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/film_reviews/article5548068.ece |title=I Love You Phillip Morris at the Sundance Film Festival, Utah |publisher=The Times |author=Wise, Damon |date=January 20, 2009 |accessdate=March 19, 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the first time in his career, Carrey portrayed multiple characters in [[Disney]]'s 3D animated take on the classic [[Charles Dickens]] tale, ''[[A Christmas Carol (2009 film)|A Christmas Carol]]'' (2009), voicing [[Ebenezer Scrooge]] and the [[Ghost of Christmas Past|Ghosts of Christmas Past]], [[Ghost of Christmas Present|Present]], and [[Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come|Future]]. Directed by [[Robert Zemeckis]], the film also starred [[Robin Wright Penn]], [[Bob Hoskins]], [[Colin Firth]], [[Gary Oldman]], and [[Cary Elwes]]. The film received reasonable reviews and was a financial success. In 2011, Carrey landed the lead role in ''[[Mr. Popper's Penguins (film)|Mr. Popper's Penguins]]'', playing Thomas "Tom" Popper Jr. a realtor who becomes the caretaker of a family of penguins. The film received a mixed reception upon release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mr_poppers_penguins_2010/|title=Mr. Popper's Penguins&amp;nbsp;– Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=June 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, he starred alongside former co-star [[Steve Carell]] in the [[Don Scardino]]-directed comedy film ''[[The Incredible Burt Wonderstone]]''. Carrey played Steve Gray, a dangerous street magician who overshadows the formerly successful magician Burt Wonderstone (played by Carell). The film was released in March 2013 to mixed reviews and underperformed significantly at the box office, grossing just over $27 million on a $30 million budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=burtwonderstone.htm|title=The Incredible Burt Wonderstone (2013) – Box Office Mojo|work=boxofficemojo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Farrelly]] said in April 2012 that Carrey and [[Jeff Daniels]] would return for a ''Dumb and Dumber'' sequel, ''Dumb and Dumber To'', with the Farrelly brothers writing and directing and a planned September 2012 production start.&lt;ref name="comingsoon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=88661 |title=Exclusive: Dumb and Dumber 2 Begins Production This September |publisher=ComingSoon.net |date=April 1, 2012 |accessdate=May 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June, however, Carrey's representative said Carrey had left the project because the comedian felt New Line and Warner Bros. were unenthusiastic toward it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etonline.com/movies/122750_Dumb_and_Dumber_Sequel_Loses_Jim_Carrey/index.html|title=Jim Carrey Moves on From 'Dumber' Sequel|publisher=etonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on October 1, 2012, Yahoo!'s "The Yo Show" carried the news item that the script was complete and that the original actors, Carrey and Daniels, would be reprising their roles. The plot involved one of the characters having sired a child and needing to find them in order to obtain a kidney.&lt;ref name="dumber2-march2013" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://omg.yahoo.com/yo-show/delayed-movie-sequels-worth-the-wait-30732003.html |title=The Yo Show – Yahoo! omg! |publisher=Omg.yahoo.com |date= |accessdate=October 22, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023091318/http://omg.yahoo.com/yo-show/delayed-movie-sequels-worth-the-wait-30732003.html |archivedate=October 23, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Dumb and Dumber To]]'' was released in November 2014.

In March 2013, Carrey announced that he had written a children's book titled ''How Roland Rolls'', about a scared wave named Roland. He described it as "kind of a metaphysical children's story, which deals with a lot of heavy stuff in a really childish way." Carrey self-published the book, which was released in September 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.retfordtoday.co.uk/news/showbiz-news/carrey-reading-to-kids-is-heaven-1-5493217 |title=Carrey: Reading to kids is heaven |publisher=Retford Trader and Guardian |date=March 13, 2013 |accessdate=March 14, 2013 }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hitfix.com/videos/the-incredible-burt-wonderstone-jim-carrey-interview |title=The Incredible Burt Wonderstone – Jim Carrey Interview |publisher=HitFix.com |date=March 13, 2013 |accessdate=March 14, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130428081300/http://www.hitfix.com/videos/the-incredible-burt-wonderstone-jim-carrey-interview |archivedate=April 28, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 25, 2013, Carrey released a [[parody]] music video with [[Eels (band)|Eels]] through [[Funny or Die]], with Carrey replacing [[Mark Oliver Everett]] on vocals. The song and video, titled "[[Cold Dead Hand]]" and set as a musical act during the variety program ''[[Hee Haw]]'', lampoons American [[gun culture]], and specifically former [[National Rifle Association|NRA]] spokesperson [[Charlton Heston]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/videos/jim-carrey-eels-team-for-gun-culture-parody-20130325|title=Jim Carrey, Eels Team for Gun Culture Parody|work=Rolling Stone}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carrey delivered the commencement address at [[Maharishi University of Management]] in [[Fairfield, Iowa]], in May 2014 and received an honorary doctorate for his achievements as a comedian, artist, author, and philanthropist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Jim Carrey Awarded Honorary Doctorate Degree |publisher=International Business Times |date=May 27, 2014 |url=https://uk.news.yahoo.com/jim-carrey-awarded-honorary-doctorate-degree-125435285.html#QrQdz1i |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140601012244/https://uk.news.yahoo.com/jim-carrey-awarded-honorary-doctorate-degree-125435285.html#QrQdz1i |archivedate=June 1, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 29, 2014, Carrey was honored by [[Canada Post]] with a limited-edition postage stamp with his portrait on it. The stamps will not be reprinted once they are sold out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/news/canada-post-honours-canuck-comedians-with-new-stamp-series-1.2750407|title=Canada Post honours Canuck comedians with new stamp series|date=August 29, 2014|work=cbc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2017 [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] began airing the dramedy ''[[I'm Dying Up Here]]'', for which Carrey served as the executive producer.

I really hope that some day soon people will stop trying to profit from this and let her rest in peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2016/09/19/jim-carrey-sued-wrongful-death-girlfriend/90704556|title=Jim Carrey sued for wrongful death of girlfriend|author=Puente, Maria|website=[[USA Today]]|date=September 19, 2016|accessdate=September 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/20/jim-carrey-sued-over-former-girlfriends-suicide-cathriona-white|title=Jim Carrey sued over former girlfriend's suicide|website=[[The Guardian]]|date=September 20, 2016|accessdate=September 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In October 2016, White's mother, Brigid Sweetman, also filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Carrey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/cathriona-whites-mom-sues-jim-carrey-for-wrongful-death-w444401|title=Cathriona White's Mom, Brigid Sweetman, Sues Jim Carrey for Daughter's Wrongful Death|website=Us Weekly|first=Sierra|last=Marquina|date=October 11, 2016|accessdate=October 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this suit, Sweetman's attorney states that Carrey underwent a test for [[sexually transmitted infection]]s and "purposely hid the results from Ms. White, whom he was intimately involved with, and failed to inform her that he had tested positive for [[hepatitis A]], HSV ([[herpes]]) I and II, and [[chlamydia]]. To make matters worse, Carrey then proceeded to have unprotected sex with Ms. White with full knowledge that he was STD positive."&lt;ref name=std&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/celebrity-life/celebrities-gone-bad/jim-carrey-alleged-std-test-has-been-submitted-as-evidence/news-story/a3cb917d20ce8a954da2ca593d3c0901|title=Jim Carrey alleged STD test has been submitted as evidence|website=News.com.au|date=October 22, 2016|accessdate=October 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sweetman herself later issued a statement: "These documents show that Jim Carrey has lied to the media, the public and the court. Carrey has now been shown for what he is — a dishonest Hollywood celebrity who thinks he can say anything and fool people just because he is famous."&lt;ref name=std/&gt; The lawsuit was dismissed on January 25, 2018, and attorneys for both sides confirmed there would be no further legal proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McLevy|first1=Alex|title=Court dismisses wrongful death lawsuit against Jim Carrey|url=https://www.avclub.com/court-dismisses-wrongful-death-lawsuit-against-jim-carr-1822630778|website=The A.V.

===Citizenship===
Carrey received [[U.S. citizenship]] in October 2004 and remains a [[dual citizen]] of the United States and his native Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Silverman|first=Stephen M.|title=Jim Carrey Becomes New U.S. Citizen|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,714343,00.html|work=People.com|accessdate=September 10, 2011|date=October 14, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beliefs===
Carrey believes the [[MMR vaccine controversy|MMR vaccine]] causes [[autism]], which is contrary to scientific consensus. In 2009, he wrote an article questioning the merits of vaccination and vaccine research for ''[[The Huffington Post]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jim-carrey/the-judgment-on-vaccines_b_189777.html |title=Jim Carrey: The Judgment on Vaccines Is In??? |work=Huffington Post |accessdate=February 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; With former partner [[Jenny McCarthy]], Carrey led a "[[Green Our Vaccines]]" march in Washington, D.C., to advocate for the removal of toxic substances from children's vaccines, out of a belief that children had received "too many vaccines, too soon, many of which are toxic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/OnCall/story?id=4987758 |publisher=ABC News |title=Celeb Couple to Lead 'Green Vaccine' Rally |first1=Jonann |last1=Brady |first2=Stephanie |last2=Dahle |date=June 4, 2008 |accessdate=March 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rally was criticized by [[David Gorski]], an American [[surgical oncologist]] on ''[[Science-Based Medicine]]'' blog for being anti-vaccine, not "pro-safe vaccine"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/jenny-mccarthy-jim-carrey-and-green-our-vaccines-anti-vaccine-not-pro-safe-vaccine/ |title=Jenny McCarthy, Jim Carrey, and "Green Our Vaccines": Anti-vaccine, not "pro-safe vaccine" |work=Science Based Medicine |accessdate=July 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by Steven Parker on [[WebMD]] website for being "irresponsible".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.webmd.com/healthy-children/2008/06/green-our-vaccines.html |title=Green Our Vaccines? |work=WebMD |accessdate=July 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 1, 2015, after the signing of a [[California Senate Bill 277|new vaccination law]], Carrey called [[California Governor]] [[Jerry Brown]] a "corporate [[Fascism|fascist]]" who was poisoning children by enacting the vaccination requirements.&lt;ref name=fascist&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-actor-jim-carrey-vaccines-20150701-story.html |title=Jim Carrey calls Gov. Brown a 'fascist' for signing new vaccination law |work=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=July 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law disallowed religious and philosophical reasons for exemption from vaccination. Carrey was criticized for being "ignorant when it comes to vaccines" by [[Arthur Caplan]], head of the Division of Medical Ethics, at [[New York University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/commentary-why-jim-carrey-wrong-about-vaccines-n385321 |title=Ethicist: Why Jim Carrey is Wrong About Vaccines |work=NBCnews |accessdate=July 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[Jeffrey Kluger]], senior writer at ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', who described his anti-vaccination statements as "angry, dense and immune to reason".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://time.com/3944067/jim-carrey-vaccines/ |title=Ethicist: Jim Carrey, Please Shut Up About Vaccines |work=Times Magazine |accessdate=July 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carrey believes in and advocates for the so-called "[[Law of attraction (New Thought)|law of attraction]]". In an interview with [[Oprah Winfrey]] on February 17, 1997,&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|nPU5bjzLZX0|What Oprah Learned from Jim Carrey – Oprah's Lifeclass – Oprah Winfrey Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; he revealed that as a struggling actor he would use [[Creative visualization|visualization]] techniques to get work. He also stated that he visualized a $10,000,000 check given to him for "acting services rendered", placed the check in his pocket, and seven years later received a $10,000,000 check for his role in ''Dumb and Dumber.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.oprah.com/oprahs-lifeclass/what-oprah-learned-from-jim-carrey-video|title=What Oprah Learned from Jim Carrey|newspaper=Oprah.com|language=en-us|access-date=2017-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carrey practices [[Transcendental Meditation technique|Transcendental Meditation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hasty |first=Katie |title=Carrey on ''Dumb and Dumber'' sequel |url=http://www.hitfix.com/news/jim-carrey-on-finished-dumb-and-dumber-to-very-funny |accessdate=April 23, 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6P3ECujIn?url=http://www.hitfix.com/news/jim-carrey-on-finished-dumb-and-dumber-to-very-funny |archivedate=April 23, 2014 |quote=The DLF raises awareness and furthers education on transcendental meditation, of which Carrey is a practicioner [''sic''] and admirer. |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/28/showbiz/celebrity-news-gossip/jim-carrey-commencement-speech/|title=Jim Carrey's inspiring commencement speech|author=Lisa Respers France, CNN|date=May 28, 2014|work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carrey has been showing his own political cartoon drawings since August 2017, including controversial renderings of White House Press Secretary [[Sarah Huckabee Sanders]] and President [[Donald Trump]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2018/03/19/a-short-history-of-jim-carreys-burgeoning-career-as-an-anti-trump-political-cartoonist/&lt;/ref&gt;
