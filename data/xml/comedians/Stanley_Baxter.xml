'''Stanley Baxter''' (born 24 May 1926) is an award-winning [[Scottish people|Scottish]] actor and [[Impressionist (entertainment)|impressionist]], known for his popular British television comedy shows ''The Stanley Baxter Show'', ''Baxter On...'', ''Time For Baxter'', ''The Stanley Baxter Picture Show'', ''The Stanley Baxter Series'' and ''[[Mr Majeika]]''. 

He began his career as a child actor on [[BBC Scotland]]. In a long career he has worked with some celebrated colleagues in a wide range of productions in radio, theatre, television and films. He has also written a number of books based on [[Glasgow]].

==Early life==
The son of an insurance manager, Baxter was born in [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]]. He was educated at [[Hillhead High School]], Glasgow, and schooled for the stage by his mother. He began his career as a child actor in the Scottish edition of the BBC's ''[[Children's Hour]]''. He developed his performing skills further during his [[national service]] with the [[Combined Services Entertainment]] unit, working alongside comedy actor [[Kenneth Williams]], film director [[John Schlesinger]] and dramatist [[Peter Nichols]], who used the experience as the basis for his play ''Privates on Parade''.

After the war Baxter returned to Glasgow taking to the stage for three years at Glasgow’s [[Citizens' Theatre]]. Following success on the radio with [[Jimmy Logan]], [[Howard &amp; Wyndham Ltd]] invited him to star in pantomime at the [[Theatre Royal, Glasgow|Theatre Royal]] in Glasgow followed by the Half Past Eight Shows, and their successors the Five Past Eight Shows at Glasgow's [[Alhambra Theatre Glasgow|Alhambra Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Kings Theatre, Glasgow: Entertaining a Nation'' by Graeme Smith published 2008 {{ISBN|978-0-9559420-0-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Alhambra Glasgow'' by Graeme Smith published 2011 {{ISBN|978-0-9559420-1-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He moved to London to work in television in 1959. In 1969 he performed in the original production of [[Joe Orton]]'s then controversial farce ''[[What the Butler Saw (play)|What the Butler Saw]]'' at the Queen's Theatre in the [[West End theatre|West End]] with [[Sir Ralph Richardson]], [[Coral Browne]] and [[Hayward Morse]]. Baxter nurtured the stage careers of Alyson McInnes and John Ramage. Baxter remained a great favourite on the Scottish pantomime circuit, especially at the [[King's Theatre, Glasgow|King's Theatre]], Glasgow, up until his retirement in 1992. He starred, in pantomime, with popular Scottish stars, [[Jimmy Logan]] and [[Una McLean]].

==Radio==
During the 1960s, Baxter had his own show on [[BBC Radio Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMnKPnPhhYw |title=Teach Yourself To Speak Scottish - 4 - Parliamo Glasgow |publisher=YouTube |date=11 January 2008 |accessdate=9 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994 he returned to radio, taking the role of [[Noël Coward]] in the [[BBC World Service]] Play of the Week, ''Marvellous Party''&lt;ref&gt;^ Newley, Patrick. "Coward’s confidante - Esme Wynne", The Stage, 4 March 2005&lt;/ref&gt; directed by Neil Cargill. Written by [[Jon Wynne-Tyson]], it also starred [[Dorothy Tutin]] as Coward's lifelong friend, Esme Wynne-Tyson (Jon's mother). Also with Cargill, he read ''Whisky Galore''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiolistings.co.uk/programmes/w/wh/whisky_galore.html |title='&amp;#39;Whisky Galore'&amp;#39; |publisher=Radiolistings.co.uk |date= |accessdate=7 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Jimmy Swan - The Joy Traveller''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiolistings.co.uk/programmes/j/ji/jimmy_swan__the_joy_traveller.html |title='&amp;#39;Jimmy Swan - The Joy Traveller'&amp;#39; |publisher=Radiolistings.co.uk |date=13 April 2012 |accessdate=7 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; for BBC Radio, providing the voices of all the characters.

After a lengthy spell in self-imposed retirement, he appeared in 2004 in a series of four half-hour radio [[sitcom]]s for [[BBC Radio 4]], entitled ''Stanley Baxter and Friends'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiolistings.co.uk/programmes/s/st/stanley_baxter_and_friends.html |title='&amp;#39;Stanley Baxter and Friends'&amp;#39; |publisher=Radiolistings.co.uk |date= |accessdate=7 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the success of this has led to further series entitled ''[[Marilyn Imrie#The Stanley Baxter Playhouse: Cold Call|The Stanley Baxter Playhouse]]'' in 2006, [[Marilyn Imrie#The Stanley Baxter Playhouse: The King's Kilt|2008]], [[Marilyn Imrie#The Stanley Baxter Playhouse: Astonishing Archie|2009]], [[Marilyn Imrie#The Stanley Baxter Playhouse: The Porter's Story|2010]], 2013 and 2014, and ''[[Marilyn Imrie#Two Pipe Problems: A Streetcar Named Revenge|Two Pipe Problems]]'' with [[Richard Briers]] in 2008, [[Marilyn Imrie#Two Pipe Problems|2009]] and [[Marilyn Imrie#Two Pipe Problem 2010: Right Old Charlie|2010]]. Two further plays in this series were broadcast in 2013 with [[Geoffrey Palmer (actor)|Geoffrey Palmer]] taking the  Richard Briers role. In 2009 [[Eddie Izzard]] presented ''The Stanley Baxter Story'' on [[BBC Radio 2]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiolistings.co.uk/programmes/s/st/stanley_baxter_story__the.html |title='&amp;#39;The Stanley Baxter Story'&amp;#39; |publisher=Radiolistings.co.uk |date= |accessdate=7 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Television==
Baxter was known for his impressions of famous people, particularly the [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen]] (referred to in the context of the shows as 'the Duchess of Brendagh'). The ''Stanley Baxter Show'' ran between 1963 and 1971 on [[BBC One]], and the ''Stanley Baxter Picture Show'' from 1972 to 1975 on [[ITV Network|ITV]]; the six-part ''Stanley Baxter Series'' was made by [[LWT]] in 1981. Eight one-hour TV specials were made by LWT and the BBC between 1973 and 1986.

Baxter guest-starred in an episode of ''[[The Goodies (TV series)|The Goodies]]'' and later appeared in the lead role in ''[[Mr Majeika]]'', developed from the books by [[Humphrey Carpenter]], a children's show about a magic teacher, expelled from Walpurgis (the wizard land) for failing his professional examinations. He later stated that he had wanted to retire after his spectacular hour-long shows had been axed and that the move to children's television was a "purely financial" arrangement. In [[Bing Crosby]]'s final [[Christmas]] special, taped for CBS in the UK just a few weeks before Crosby's death in 1977, Baxter played multiple roles, including a butler, cook and - in one skit opposite a cracking-up Crosby - the ghost of [[Bob Hope]]'s court jester ancestor. Having retired in 1990, Baxter returned for a one-off [[Christmas]] 2008 special for [[ITV Network|ITV]], containing a mix of archived and new material, with celebrity comedians commenting on Baxter's influence on their lives and careers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7715647.stm Comedian Baxter to make TV return], BBCNews, Accessed 07/11/2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film==
Baxter appeared in a number of films, including ''[[Geordie (film)|Geordie]]'' (1955), ''[[Very Important Person (film)|Very Important Person]]'' (1961), ''[[The Fast Lady]]'' (1962), ''[[Crooks Anonymous]]'' (1962) and ''[[Father Came Too!]]'' (1963), the last four alongside [[James Robertson Justice]], together with the animation ''[[The Thief and the Cobbler|Arabian Knight]]'' (1995).

==Books==
He has written a number of books based on the language of Glasgow, as developed in his ''Parliamo Glasgow'' sketch, and on the humour of the city;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/stanley-baxters-bedside-book-of-glasgow-humour/oclc/13795450 |title=Stanley Baxter's bedside book of Glasgow humour (Book, 1986) |publisher=[WorldCat.org] |date=1999-02-22 |accessdate=2014-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Baxter was brought up in the [[West End of Glasgow]], in the third block of a set of mansion flats. He lived there from the age of 5 until he married at 26 years of age. He later lived in [[Highgate]], north London. He was married for 46 years. His wife Moira died in 1997. In August 2014, Baxter was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to ''[[The Guardian]]'' expressing their hope that Scotland would vote to remain part of the United Kingdom in September's [[Scottish independence referendum, 2014|referendum on that issue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/aug/07/celebrities-open-letter-scotland-independence-full-text |title=Celebrities' open letter to Scotland – full text and list of signatories &amp;#124; Politics |publisher=theguardian.com |date=2014-08-07 |accessdate=2014-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
