'''Stephen Gilchrist Glover''' (born June 13, 1974), better known by his stage name '''Steve-O''', is an actor, stunt performer, producer, stand-up comedian,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/up-close-and-personal-with-the-all-new-steve-o|title=Up Close and Personal With the All-New Steve-O|author=Yamato, Jen|date=April 12, 2016|publisher=''The Daily Beast|accessdate=August 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; author, musician and clown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://people.com/tv/steve-o-recalls-being-a-cocaine-addicted-clown/|title=Steve-O Recalls Being a 'Cocaine-Addicted Clown'|author=Parsley, Aaron|date=April 21, 2009|publisher=''[[People (magazine)|People]]''|accessdate=July 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He holds British, American and Canadian citizenship. His entertainment career is mostly centered on his performance stunts on the American TV series ''[[Jackass (TV series)|Jackass]]'', its related movies, and its spin-off series ''[[Wildboyz]]''.&lt;ref name=HospitalSun /&gt;

Steve-O is known for his eccentric character. He has a number of tattoos, which he refers to as "dumb tattoos", including "Your Name" written on his right buttock (in order to say "I got your name tattooed on my ass") and a portrait of himself which covers half of his back and sports the words "yeah dude, I rock!"

==Early life==
Steve-O was born in [[Wimbledon, London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sunshinecoastdaily.com.au/story/2008/03/05/steve-o-trouble-law-again|title=Steve-O in with the law again|newspaper=The Sunshine Coast Daily|date=March 5, 2008|accessdate=September 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother, Donna Gay Glover (née Wauthier), was Canadian, and his father, Richard Edward (Ted) Glover, was American.&lt;ref name=lat&gt;{{Cite news|last=Lovece|first=Frank|title=Q&amp;A: Steve-O of 'Jackass 3-D'|publisher=AZ Central|date=October 11, 2010|url=http://www.azcentral.com/thingstodo/movies/articles/2010/10/11/20101011jacass-3d-steveo-stunts.html|accessdate=October 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His paternal grandfather was English and his maternal step-grandfather was voice-over announcer [[Wayne Howell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Professional-Idiot-Stephen-steve-Glover/dp/1401324339#reader_1401324339|title=Professional Idiot: A Memoir: Stephen Steve-O Glover, David Peisner: 9781401324339: Amazon.com: Books|publisher=Amazon.com|date=June 7, 2011|accessdate=May 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His family was based in Brazil for many years due to his father's presidency of the South American division of [[Pepsi|Pepsi-Cola]]. Childhood residencies include [[Toronto, Ontario|Toronto, Canada]], [[Brazil]],  [[Venezuela]] and [[Miami, Florida]].&lt;ref name="Steve-O 2004"&gt;''Steve-O: The Early Years DVD'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; At age nine his family returned to London where Steve-O attended the [[American School in London]] in St John's Wood for four years.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

Growing up, he was an avid [[Mötley Crüe]] fan. On October 25, 1987, Mötley Crüe was playing at [[Maple Leaf Gardens]] in Toronto where his family was living at the time. He phoned every hotel within and outside the vicinity until he found the name that the band usually checked in under, manager [[Doc McGhee]]. He did not speak to Doc, but rather his brother Scott, but McGhee was so impressed with the resolve of Steve-O to meet Mötley Crüe that he brought him out for their show, let him meet them, and hang with them backstage, as told in [[Tommy Lee]]'s autobiography.&lt;ref name="SuicideGirls.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://suicidegirls.com/interviews/Johnny+Knoxville+and+Steve-O%3A+Jackass+3D|title=Johnny Knoxville and Steve-O: Jackass 3D|publisher=SuicideGirls.com|date=October 15, 2010|accessdate=December 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He attended the [[University of Miami]] but dropped out after one year due to poor grades and acts of disobedience in school. He also attended the [[University of New Mexico]] from 1996-97.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xrjeq/steveo_here/cfdzakr|title=officiallysteveo comments on Steve-O here|publisher=Reddit.com|date=February 12, 2014|accessdate=May 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then attended and graduated from the [[Ringling Brothers and Barnum &amp; Bailey Clown College]] in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/272613411.html?dids=272613411:272613411&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Dec+31%2C+2002&amp;author=&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post&amp;desc=Steve-O%3A+Jackass+in+the+Flesh%2C+and+Blood&amp;pqatl=google|title=Steve-O: Jackass in the Flesh, and Blood|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=December 31, 2002|accessdate=October 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; After graduation he was not selected to join the [[Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey Circus]], but worked as a clown in a circus at the [[Fort Lauderdale Swap Shop]] flea market. He filmed his stunts, including his clown performances, throughout this period.&lt;ref name="Steve-O 2004"/&gt;

His mother, Donna, died on November 7, 2003, five years after suffering an aneurysm.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

==Career==

===''Jackass'' and tours (2000–2003)===
[[File:Steve-O, 2003 interview.jpg|thumb|Steve-O in 2003.]]
While performing in the flea market circus, Steve-O began sending videos of himself to ''[[Big Brother (magazine)|Big Brother]]'' magazine editor and future ''[[Jackass (TV series)|Jackass]]'' director [[Jeff Tremaine]]. After admitting that the only thing he was scared of was spiders, Tremaine recruited Steve-O for MTV's television series ''[[Jackass (TV series)|Jackass]]'', which became an instant hit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/69789149.html?dids=69789149:69789149&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Mar+18%2C+2001&amp;author=ROBIN+RAUZI&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;desc=Cover+Story%3B+Not+Such+a+Dumb+Stunt+After+All%3B+As+MTV's+'Jackass'+takes+heat+from+politicians%2C+Johnny+Knoxville+is+moving+his+career+beyond+the+hit+show's+gross-out+pranks.&amp;pqatl=google|title=Not Such a Dumb Stunt After All;|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=March 18, 2001|first=Robin|last=Rauzi|accessdate=October 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; MTV has subsequently released five movies based on the series: ''[[Jackass: The Movie]]'' (2002), ''[[Jackass Number Two]]'' (2006), direct-home release ''[[Jackass 2.5]]'' (2007), ''[[Jackass 3D]]'' (2010), and ''[[Jackass 3.5]]''. The installments ''[[Jackass: The Movie]]'', ''[[Jackass Number Two]]'', ''[[Jackass 3D]]'', and ''[[Jackass Presents: Bad Grandpa]]'' all became box office hits.

In 2001, he released ''[[Don't Try This at Home: The Steve-O Video|Don't Try This at Home]]'' on DVD, which contained material MTV censored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/g/GooglePM/CRGB/lib00212,0F80DEF75ADDD57E.html|title=Steve-O takes great pains|work=[[The Gazette (Cedar Rapids)|The Gazette]]|date=December 19, 2002|accessdate=October 15, 2009|first1=John|last1=Kenyon}}&lt;/ref&gt; It went on to sell 140,000 copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/588598361.html?dids=588598361:588598361&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Mar+25%2C+2004&amp;author=&amp;pub=The+Record&amp;desc=Drunken+Jackass+is+often+too+much&amp;pqatl=google|title=Drunken Jackass is often too much|newspaper=[[Waterloo Region Record|The Record]]|date=March 25, 2004|accessdate=October 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He toured promoting the DVD doing stunts, which was filmed and released as ''Don't Try This at Home Volume 2: The Tour''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/projo/access/254304361.html?dids=254304361:254304361&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Dec+05%2C+2002&amp;author=VAUGHN+WATSON++Journal+Pop+Music+Writer&amp;pub=The+Providence+Journal&amp;desc=Jackass-inspired+'extreme+standup'+show+brings+excess+to+Lupo's+on+Sunday&amp;pqatl=google|title=Jackass-inspired 'extreme standup' show brings excess to Lupo's|newspaper=[[Providence Journal]]|date=December 5, 2002|accessdate=October 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 31, 2002, Steve-O was arrested on [[obscenity]] and assault charges for stapling his [[scrotum]] to his leg, and for being a [[Principal (criminal law)|principal]] to a second-degree [[Battery (crime)|battery]], during a performance at a nightclub in [[Houma, Louisiana]] on July 11, 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1456408/08012002/id_0.jhtml|title=Steve-O Faces Obscenity Charges|publisher=MTV|date=August 1, 2002|accessdate=October 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1457562/20020916/story.jhtml|title=For The Record: Quick News On|publisher=MTV|date=September 16, 2002|accessdate=October 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1459180/20021216/story.jhtml|title=For The Record: Quick News On|publisher=MTV | date=December 16, 2002|accessdate=October 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; After several delays, in March 2003 Steve-O made a deal with Louisiana prosecutors placing him on supervised [[probation]] for one year, requiring him to make a charitable donation of $5,000 to a shelter for battered women and children and forbidding him from ever performing in [[Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana]] again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1470726/20030324/story.jhtml|title=Steve-O Gets Probation For Stapling|publisher=MTV|date=March 24, 2003|accessdate=October 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Steve-O toured Europe with [[Bam Margera]], a friend and co-star of ''Jackass''. On May 22, 2003, Steve-O was arrested and jailed while in [[Sweden]] due to footage of himself swallowing a condom containing [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] to get it past authorities while flying on a plane. He then regurgitated it live on stage, which he showed in his DVD Steve-O: Out on Bail (aka Don't Try This at Home – The Steve-O Video Vol. 3: Out on Bail) (2003). Steve-O reached a deal with the Swedish prosecutors and was released on May 27, 2003 after paying a 45,000 [[Swedish krona|kronor]] (about 6,700 USD) fine. As part of the plea bargain Steve-O admitted to possessing one [[Methylenedioxymethamphetamine|ecstasy]] tablet and five grams of [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]], although he claimed he had no knowledge of where the ecstasy came from.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2003-05-23-jackass-arrest_x.htm|title='Jackass' star arrested in Sweden|work=[[USA Today]]|date=May 27, 2003|accessdate=October 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Swedish arrest was included in the third installment of the DVD series titled ''Steve-O: Out on Bail''. Two months later on July 19, 2003, Steve-O was arrested on charges of [[disorderly conduct]] for urinating on potato chips in public during a [[Lollapalooza]] tour concert in [[Burgettstown, Pennsylvania]]. Steve-O claimed he was kicked off the tour by Lollapalooza producers because of the incident.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1474443/20030722/story.jhtml ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012130725/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1474443/20030722/story.jhtml |date=October 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===After ''Jackass'' (2004–2007)===
After ''Jackass'' ended, he co-starred with [[Chris Pontius]] on MTV's ''[[Wildboyz]]'', which lasted four seasons until 2006. The two performed stunts and acts with animals, often putting themselves in situations for which they were not trained.

In mid-2005, he became the spokesperson for the Sneaux brand of footwear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sneauxshoes.com|title=Sneaux Shoes Official Website to Shop Online for Mens, Womens, Boys and Infant Skater Footwear|publisher=Sneauxshoes.com|accessdate=September 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Television commercials promoting the shoe company include such acts as Steve-O jumping into garbage, getting his foot bitten by an alligator (simulated) and drinking rotten milk. His slogan is "They're darn good shoes."

On March 27, 2006, he and ''Jackass'' co-star [[Chris Pontius]] visited ''[[Dean Blundell|The Dean Blundell Show]]'', a morning show on Toronto radio station [[CFNY-FM|CFNY]] (102.1 The Edge), to promote their "[[Don't Try This at Home: The Steve-O Video|Don't Try This at Home]]" tour. He urinated on the floor and performed a stunt called "Unwrapping the Mummy" all in front of a live studio audience. Hosts Dean Blundell, Jason Barr, and Todd Shapiro were suspended for the week following the appearance, after many complaints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chartattack.com/news/35846/steve-o-gets-t-o-shock-jock-kicked-off-the-air |title=Steve-O Gets T.O.

On July 18, 2006, Steve-O became a late contestant on the British reality show ''[[Love Island (2005 TV series)|Love Island]]'' broadcast on [[ITV Network|ITV]] from [[Fiji]] in an effort to boost ratings. Despite stating he had stopped drinking, he asked for beer while on the show. On July 19, 2006 he abruptly left ''Love Island'' because he was not allowed the beer and chocolate which he had requested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/5194194.stm|title=Jackass star departs Love Island|date=July 19, 2006|publisher=BBC|accessdate=September 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2006, he went on a drug binge after being misdiagnosed with [[cardiomyopathy]], a serious heart condition.&lt;ref name="Heartcondition"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/premium/0286/0286-24137331.html|title=They said I was dying so I got off my nut on drugs|date=November 3, 2006|publisher=Europe Intelligence Wire|accessdate=October 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was later examined by heart specialists who concluded he was in good health.&lt;ref name="Heartcondition"/&gt;

In 2007, Steve-O starred in his own television show called ''[[Dr. Steve-O]]'' on the [[USA Network]]. In the show, he helped make his guests cool and "de-wussify" them. That same year he appeared in ''[[Jackass 2.5]]'', which mainly consisted of material that did not appear in the second ''Jackass'' movie. Additionally, he appeared with some ''Jackass'' alumni in ''[[National Lampoon's TV: The Movie]].

On February 5, 2008, he appeared on ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'' with [[Howard Stern]], [[Robin Quivers]] and [[Artie Lange]] on Sirius Satellite radio to promote his upcoming rap album ''Hard As a Rock''. Another mix-CD released by Steve-O is called ''The Dumbest Asshole in Hip Hop''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.steveomixtape.com |title=SteveO Rap CD/DVD |publisher=Steveomixtape.com |accessdate=September 17, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110203015543/http://www.steveomixtape.com/ |archivedate=February 3, 2011 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychiatric problems and rehab (2008)===
On February 23, 2008 Steve-O joined the rest of the ''Jackass'' crew for the ''[[Jackassworld.com: 24 Hour Takeover|Jackass MTV 24 Hour Takeover]]'', which promoted JackassWorld.com. He participated in several stunts, and even debuted his rap music video which was executive produced by recording artist D-Jukes, leading to [[Mike Judge]] bringing back the duo of [[Beavis and Butt-head]] for the first time in years to criticize it. Later, during the live broadcast Steve-O was kicked out of MTV studios on the request of executives for his behavior and intoxication.&lt;ref name="DemiseandRise"/&gt;

On March 9, 2008, after receiving an e-mail from Steve-O that suggested his possible suicide, Steve-O's friends, including co-star [[Johnny Knoxville]], became concerned he was a danger to himself and consulted with physician [[Dr. Drew Pinsky]], who told them to get Steve-O to a hospital immediately. Steve-O was placed on a [[5150 (Involuntary psychiatric hold)|72-hour psychiatric hold]] which was later lengthened to 14 days due to an alleged suicide attempt.&lt;ref name="HospitalSun"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/zap-steveohospitalizedcocainepossession,0,115652.story|title='Jackass' Star Steve-O Hospitalized|work=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|date=March 13, 2008|accessdate=October 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a mass e-mail addressed to his friends, Steve-O expressed that he previously had thought of his drug use and [[Bipolar disorder|bipolarity]] as a "good thing", but that he now realizes that his drug use was apparently hurting those he loved most.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20184361,00.html?xid-steve-o-aol-entertainment-news|title=Steve-O Tells Friends: I'm Paying for My Self-Destructive Behavior|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]|date=March 14, 2008|accessdate=October 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 4, 2008, Steve-O pleaded guilty to felony possession of [[cocaine]]. He avoided jail by the successful completion of his treatment program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.realitytvworld.com/news/steve-o-pleads-guilty-felony-cocaine-charge-but-avoids-jail-time-7227.php|title=Steve-O pleads guilty to felony cocaine charge but avoids jail time|publisher=Reality TV World|date=June 4, 2008|accessdate=October 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July, after 115 days of sobriety, Steve-O announced he was "back in the loony bin".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/news/entertainment/jackass-back-in-loony-bin/2008/07/08/1215282793734.html|title=Jackass 'back in loony bin'|work=[[Brisbane Times]]|date=July 8, 2008|accessdate=October 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to the mental institution, he said, because "I've had horrible mood swings and severe depression. My brain is fucked up from using so much cocaine, [[ketamine]], [[Phencyclidine|PCP]], [[nitrous oxide]], and all sorts of other drugs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.itv.com/Entertainment/celebrity/Articles/SteveOs-hospital-return-677088420.html|title=Steve-O's hospital return|publisher=[[ITV Network|ITV]]|date=July 8, 2008|accessdate=October 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-rehab, ''Jackass'' reprised and comedy tours (2009–2012)===
In March 2009, Steve-O was on the 8th season of ''[[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. season 8)|Dancing with the Stars]]'', paired with [[Lacey Schwimmer]]. After the first week, he complained of [[pinched nerve]]s and [[back spasms]] and did not compete in the second week after injuring his back further by falling on his microphone pack during [[dress rehearsal]]. The judges based their scores on his performance at the dress rehearsal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usmagazine.com/news/steve-o-sits-out-of-dancing-with-the-stars-due-to-back-injury-2009163 |title=Celebrity News: Latest Celeb News &amp; Celebrity Gossip |work=Us Weekly |accessdate=May 14, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090420081400/http://www.usmagazine.com/news/steve-o-sits-out-of-dancing-with-the-stars-due-to-back-injury-2009163 |archivedate=April 20, 2009 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was eventually eliminated in the sixth week of the competition.

On May 3, 2009, MTV premiered a documentary titled ''Steve-O: Demise and Rise'' about how his life was affected by the use of drugs and alcohol.&lt;ref name="DemiseandRise"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/ontv/dyn/steve_o/series.jhtml|title=Steve-O: Demise and Rise|publisher=MTV|year=2009|accessdate=October 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show featured home-made video footage of Steve-O using drugs and vandalizing his apartment. In an August 2009 interview with [[Johnny Knoxville]] for ''[[The Times-Picayune]]'', Knoxville on the topic of Steve-O's recovery and rehabilitation said "He's taking to sobriety like he took to drugs and alcohol, I'm very proud of him. I think we'll see him doing some stuff here really soon. As a matter of fact, I know we are."&lt;ref name="KnoxvilleAug2009"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nola.com/movies/index.ssf/2009/08/johnny_knoxville_jackass_star.html|title=Johnny Knoxville: 'Jackass' star Steve-O almost ready to dive back into his work|publisher=[[The Times-Picayune]]|date=August 4, 2009|first=Mike|last=Scott|accessdate=September 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later stated "Something's coming. We're pretty excited ... I think it'll be a big year next year, but I don't want to talk about it yet."&lt;ref name="KnoxvilleAug2009"/&gt;

Steve-O later told Comedy Digital Radio station Barry that he's never seen the MTV documentary. "When I saw the footage of myself doing drugs I felt like I could see them, I could taste them. It made me crave them and as embarrassing as that footage is, that just seemed like another reason to get high. I couldn't watch it; I haven't watched it since then. The producers put it all together and finished it up without any input for me, it's better that way."&lt;ref name="barry.com.au"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.barry.com.au/2011/05/18/exclusive-steve-o-interview/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=May 31, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725133537/http://www.barry.com.au/2011/05/18/exclusive-steve-o-interview/ |archivedate=July 25, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Then in January 2009, Steve-O announced on his website the release of a new DVD titled ''Steve-O: Pounding Out Randoms'', of which only 1000 copies have been made.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}&lt;!-- WP:RS needed; removed link to WP:SPS (Twitter, FB, WP)--&gt;

Steve-O was part of ''[[Jackass 3D]]'', the third installment of the ''Jackass'' series, released in October 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://insidemovies.moviefone.com/2009/12/21/jackass-3d-release-date-news|title='Jackass' Crew Bringing the Pain Again (in 3D!)

He also said "And to be honest it's going great. Everyone has had different injuries throughout which is a good sign and Steve-O is probably getting the best footage out of everybody. He is really going for it. He wants to prove to everyone he can do these stunts sober. It's been two years since he had a drink now. Everyone has been real supportive of him.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/article434283.ece|title=The Hindu Hot from Hollywood|work=The Hindu|date=May 20, 2010|accessdate=September 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steve-O is now a [[vegan]] for both health and compassionate reasons. After the ''Jackass 3D'' stunt involving a ram (during which he injured his hand), he has expressed some concern about doing stunts in the future that "mess with animals."&lt;ref name="SuicideGirls.com"/&gt;

When ''Jackass 3D'' was released in 2010, the movie broke box office records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/lifestyle/2010/10/18/2010-10-18_jackass_3d_box_office_boom__why_do_americans_love_to_watch_people_get_hurt.html |title='Jackass 3D' box office boom – Why do Americans love to watch people get hurt? |work=Daily News|location=New York |date=October 18, 2010 |accessdate=May 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In promoting the movie, he appeared on ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'', lighting himself on fire. In reaction, [[Howard Stern]] yelled: "Put him out! Put his head out! Fucking maniac! Oh my god, you're a maniac! You're a goddamn maniac!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.howardstern.com/rundown.hs?d=1287028800|title=STEVE-O IS ON FIRE|publisher=[[The Howard Stern Show]]|date=October 14, 2010|accessdate=November 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2010, Steve-O began touring the United States performing stand-up comedy on what he called "Steve-O's Entirely Too Much Information Tour". In early 2011, he announced a nine-month-long American comedy tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.steveo.com|title=the official site of steve-o|publisher=steveo.com|accessdate=May 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He appeared in ''[[Jackass 3.5]]'', which was released in April 2011.

On Sunday March 27, 2011, Steve-O was arrested by Canadian authorities at Calgary airport. Officers found an arrest warrant filed in 2003. Steve-O was accused of assault with a weapon. He was released after paying a caution of $10,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Paquette|first=Éric|title=Agence QMI|accessdate=March 28, 2011|url=http://tvanouvelles.ca/lcn/lebuzz/archives/2011/03/20110328-151015.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before his arrest, Steve-O spoke about
"how he outran police after a fan was, according to authorities, beaten on stage eight years ago."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vancouversun.com/entertainment/Jackass+star+Steve+recalls+running+from+Calgary+police/4522083/story.html ]{{Dead link|date=May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011, he brought his stand-up show to Australia, playing a show in all the major cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.barry.com.au/2011/04/21/steve-o-australian-tour/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=May 31, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511165006/http://www.barry.com.au/2011/04/21/steve-o-australian-tour/ |archivedate=May 11, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with Comedy Digital Radio station Barry Steve-O explained the genesis of his comedy tour, "Someone invited me to a famous comedy club in Los Angeles and they asked that I get on stage and do something outrageous. When I got to that comedy club I looked around and it occurred to me that the craziest thing I could possibly do by far would be to try stand-up comedy. Like, that was genuinely the most terrifying, outlandish just crazy thing that I could do."&lt;ref name="barry.com.au"/&gt;

In June 2011, Steve-O released an autobiography entitled ''Professional Idiot: A Memoir'', co-written with David Peisner. He has stated that he follows only a strict vegan diet and is one of the many celebrities that got involved in the [[NOH8 Campaign|NOH8 project]]. In July, he received PETA's Nanci Alexander award for his "voice against cruelty."&lt;ref&gt;China Despain Freeman,"[http://www.ecorazzi.com/2011/07/18/steve-o-receives-animal-rights-award/ Steve-O Receives Animal Rights Award]," Ecorazzi July 18, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.peta.org/b/thepetafiles/archive/2011/07/18/steve-o-takes-top-peta-honor.aspx Steve-O Snags Top PETA Award]," PETA.org July 18, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 13, 2011, during a taping of the [[Comedy Central Roast]] of [[Charlie Sheen]], Steve-O joked, "The last time this many nobodies were at a roast, at least [[The Station nightclub fire|Great White was playing]]". Steve-O has since apologized for the comment and requested that it be removed from the broadcast of the roast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.looper.com/28677/whatever-happened-steve-o/|title=Whatever happened to Steve-O?|website=Looper.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the taping of the roast, Steve-O attempted to run into the fist of boxer [[Mike Tyson]], but the first attempt didn't work. Later, at the end of the roast, Steve-O made another attempt and this time connected, resulting in Steve-O getting a broken nose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/09/21/steve-o-breaks-nose-mike-tyson_n_973840.html |title=Steve-O Runs into Mike Tyson's Fist, Breaks Nose During The Charlie Sheen Roast (VIDEO) |work=The Huffington Post |accessdate=May 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also claimed to have been sober and clean for three and a half years. Steve-O was also shown to be visibly upset by [[Amy Schumer]]'s joke about [[Ryan Dunn]]'s passing, but later stated he wasn't offended by the joke.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=My World|title=Steve O's reaction to the Amy Schumer joke about Ryan Dunn|date=March 31, 2015|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRe2Rs7LomY|accessdate=September 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was announced on October 3, 2011 that Steve-O would be hosting [[truTV]]'s new reality game show ''[[Killer Karaoke]]'', the American version of the British competition show ''[[Sing If You Can]]''. The show first aired at 9 p.m EST on November 23, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2011/10/03/trutv-greenlights-new-series-killer-karaoke-hosted-by-steve-o/105875/ |title=truTV Greenlights New Series 'Killer Karaoke,' Hosted by Steve-O – Ratings |publisher=TVbytheNumbers.Zap2it.com |date=October 3, 2011 |accessdate=May 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He told ''[[US Weekly]]'' in November 2012 that he credited his two rescue dogs, Walter and Bernie, with helping him to maintain nearly five years of sobriety.&lt;ref&gt;Kathleen Perricone,"[http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/steve-o-how-my-dogs-helped-me-with-sobriety-20122811 Steve-O: How My Dogs Helped Me With Sobriety],"  ''US Weekly'', November 28, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===2013–present===
Despite joining in 2005, Steve-O has regularly uploaded on his [[YouTube]] channel of the same name and other channels since 2013. His main channel has amassed over 3.9 million subscribers as of May 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt54Hzhj7RpCWOYpoFJLKAQ|title=steveo - YouTube |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=June 30, 2017 |website= youtube.com|publisher=YouTube |accessdate=June 30, 2017|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steve-O narrated a short video titled "What Came Before, featuring Steve-O: The Truth About Meat and Modern Farms" about some of the individual animals rescued by Farm Sanctuary and he also reveals the life of the less fortunate animals that are born into modern farming in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What Came Before|url=http://whatcamebefore.com/|publisher=Whatcambefore.com|accessdate=May 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is currently a vegan due to his concern about animal rights. Besides not eating any meat or dairy, he does not wear fur or leather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Steve-O|title=Crazy for Veggies: Cutting Cruelty Out of My Lifestyle|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/steve-o/animal-cruelty_b_2927374.html|publisher=Huffingpost.com|accessdate=May 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, it was announced that he would be charged for deadly misconduct when he did a backflip into the [[San Antonio River]] from a bridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jackass star Steve-O 'will be charged for deadly misconduct' after doing backflip off San Antonio Bridge|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2585782/Jackass-star-Steve-O-charged-deadly-misconduct-doing-backflip-San-Antonio-Bridge.html|work=Daily Mail|accessdate=October 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2014, Steve-O was announced as one of the competitors in the [[The Jump (series 2)|second series]] of British TV show ''[[The Jump]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/s231/the-jump/news/a615624/channel-4-reveals-lineup-for-the-jump-2015-joey-essex-heather-mills-more.html|title=Channel 4 reveals lineup for The Jump 2015: Joey Essex, Heather Mills, more|first=Jamie |last=Harris|date=December 10, 2014|work=Digital Spy}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the 9th eliminated.

On August 9, 2015, Steve-O climbed a construction crane in Los Angeles in a protest against [[SeaWorld]]. He lit fireworks and inflated a large whale blow-up doll on top of the crane. He broadcast the stunt on his Facebook page of LAPD and EMS responding with no knowledge of the stunt going on, and later was arrested after climbing down on charges of trespassing. Fans began a [[GoFundMe]] campaign for his bail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/Man-Reported-Atop-Crane-in-Hollywood-321218031.html|title='Jackass' Star Steve-O Arrested After Climbing Crane in Hollywood|work=NBC Southern California}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the protest, Steve-O was convicted of two misdemeanors and sentenced to 30 days of jail time and 36 months of probation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ktla.com/2015/10/07/steve-o-sentenced-to-30-days-in-jail-banned-from-hollywood-in-crane-stunt/|title=Steve-O Sentenced to 30 Days in Jail, Banned From Hollywood for Crane Stunt|publisher=KTLA}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claims he told his attorney to get jail time because it would increase the publicity and make a statement about captivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3qhzg6/i_am_steveo_jackass_entertainer_im_taping_a_very/|title=I am Steve-O, jackass, entertainer, I'm taping a very crazy comedy special for Showtime in Austin, Texas at the Paramount Theater on November 21, and going to jail on December 9, AMA... : IAmA|work=reddit}}&lt;/ref&gt; He started his jail time on December 9, 2015.
