Nealon graduated with a [[bachelor's degree]] in marketing from [[Sacred Heart University]] (and worked in a variety of part-time jobs while doing [[stand-up comedy]]).&lt;ref&gt;Loveline 1/26/2004 around the 42 minute mark&lt;/ref&gt; Nealon then took some night courses at [[Fairfield University]], where he became the starting quarterback for the school's football team.

==Career==
Nealon debuted on network television doing a stand-up routine for ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' in 1984. On the September 24, 1985 nighttime syndicated episode of ''[[Sale of the Century]]'', Nealon can be seen onstage congratulating his friend Tim Holleran on winning more than $150,000 in cash and prizes. In 1986, ''Saturday Night Live'' recruited his friend [[Dana Carvey]], and Carvey in turn recommended Nealon. Both joined the cast that year, and Nealon became a full-time performer in the 1987–1988 season, and remained for nine seasons.

In 2001, Nealon played on ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire (U.S. game show)|Who Wants to Be a Millionaire]]'' for his charity. The final question he faced, worth $125,000, was about [[Barbie]] dolls. He used his Phone-A-Friend and 50:50, but he answered the question incorrectly, thus losing $32,000 of $64,000 he had, and ended up walking away with $32,000 for his charity.
