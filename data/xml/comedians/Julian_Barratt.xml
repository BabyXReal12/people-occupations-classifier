==Career==

===Film and television===

====''The Mighty Boosh''====
{{main|The Mighty Boosh}}
Barratt stars as the character Howard Moon opposite [[Noel Fielding]]'s [[Vince Noir]] in the comedy series ''[[The Mighty Boosh]]''. Howard labels himself a "jazz maverick" and claims to be a multitalented intellectual, calling himself a "man of action", but he is actually unsuccessful in his literary and romantic ventures. He is unpopular with many of the characters, including Mrs. Gideon (who always forgets his name), Bob Fossil (who often uses Howard as a puppet for his bizarre schemes), and Bollo (who often says his name wrong or ignores him completely). Barratt composes all of the music for the series, which includes a variety of genres such as rap, [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], and [[psychedelic rock]].

====Other====
Barratt has had parts in other dramas, often alongside his ''Mighty Boosh'' partner Noel Fielding. He starred as Dan Ashcroft, a frustrated magazine writer, in the [[Channel 4]] media satire ''[[Nathan Barley]]'', and appeared in the surrealistic black comedy series ''[[Asylum (1996 TV series)|Asylum]]'' alongside [[Simon Pegg]] and [[Jessica Stevenson]] who wrote and starred in ''[[Spaced]]''. The character of Brian Topp in ''Spaced'' was written for Barratt, but eventually went to [[Mark Heap]]. Barratt played Jackson, a musician, in ''[[How Not to Live Your Life]]''. He starred in the "Freelance Scientist" commercial for [[Metz (drink)|Metz]] [[alcopop]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = York | first = Peter | title = PETER YORK ON ADS: No 289: METZ | work = The Independent | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/peter-york-on-ads-no-289-metz-1116536.html| date = 5 September 1999 | accessdate = 9 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He appeared as The Padre in the spoof horror series ''[[Garth Marenghi's Darkplace]]''. He also starred in (and was a writer for) the 1998 sketch show ''[[Unnatural Acts (1998 TV Series)|Unnatural Acts]]'', alongside Fielding. Before this, Barratt was involved in TV series ''The Pod'' with friend [[Tim Hope]], about a fictional techno band called The Pod. The show was unusual as everything was animated except for the heads of Barratt and Hope. He also appeared in the 2001 film ''[[Lucky Break (2001 film)|Lucky Break]]''.

Barratt made his directing début for [[Warp Films]] with theatre director Dan Jemmett. ''Curtains'' is set in a [[Norfolk]] seaside town. It is a dark comedy about a [[Punch and Judy]] man. In 2012, Barratt directed his first music video, for the song "All of Me" by [[Tanlines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKJ3z9Pa7AU|title=Tanlines - All Of Me|first=|last=tanlinestheband|date=21 March 2012|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; He can be heard as the voiceover on many adverts, such as [[RSA Insurance Group|More Th&gt;n]] Car, House and Pet insurance, and the [[Directgov]] advert. He appeared in the music video for [[Mint Royale]]'s "Blue Song", alongside Noel Fielding, [[Nick Frost]], and [[Michael Smiley]]. In 2010, Barratt took part in [[Sky1|Sky Comedy's]] ''[[Little Crackers]]''. He wrote and directed a 15-minute film based on his teen band, Satan's Hoof. On 12 March 2011, he made a brief appearance as Heathcliff in [[Noel Fielding]]'s "[[Wuthering Heights (song)|Wuthering Heights]]" dance on the ''[[Let's Dance for Comic Relief]]'' finale. He also narrated the 2011 documentary ''[[Seven Dwarves (TV series)|Seven Dwarves]]''.

In 2012, Barratt appeared in the miniseries ''[[Treasure Island (2012 TV miniseries)|Treasure Island]]'' on [[Sky1]], as well as narrating the [[BBC Two]] documentary ''[[The Tube (2012 TV series)|The Tube]]''. He also had a part as an art teacher in the BBC drama ''White Heat''. In 2013, he appeared in the fifth series of ''[[Being Human (UK TV series)|Being Human]]'', playing a [[werewolf]] named [[List of Being Human characters#Larry Chrysler|Larry]]. He also narrated the BBC Two documentaries ''[[The Route Masters: Running London's Roads]]'' and ''[[The Fifteen Billion Pound Railway]]''. In April 2014, he collaborated with [[Julia Davis]] and [[Joe Frank]] on Frank's radio show "Isolation," which was broadcast as part of [[KCRW]]'s UnFictional series.

In April 2016, he starred as Maurice Flowers in the Channel 4 series, "[[Flowers (TV series)|Flowers]]", a 6 part dark comedy mini series which follows the eccentric and dysfunctional members of the Flowers family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/apr/25/flowers-olivia-colman-julian-baratt|title=Flowers: Olivia Colman and Julian Barratt come together to fall apart|last=Arnold|first=Ben|date=2016-04-25|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has also played with [[Chris Corner]] in [[IAMX]].

==Personal life==
