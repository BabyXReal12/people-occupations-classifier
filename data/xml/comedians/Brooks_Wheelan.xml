==Early life and education==

==Career==
Wheelan started performing [[stand-up comedy]] in his late teens in [[Iowa]], then went to [[Kansas City]] and [[Chicago]], before eventually moving to [[Los Angeles]] where he began to perform stand-up comedy full-time. Before joining ''Saturday Night Live'', he performed stand-up comedy in Los Angeles while he had a job as a biomedical engineer, doing research on eyes and heart valves.&lt;ref name=NewYorkTimes /&gt; In 2013, Wheelan was hired to write for ''Saturday Night Live'' for the 2013–2014 season and was made a cast member the week before the season started.&lt;ref name=NewYorkTimes&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carter|first1=Bill|title=New Course for ‘Weekend Update,’ and All of ‘SNL’|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/16/business/media/saturday-night-live-setting-its-new-cast.html?_r=0|website=The New York Times|accessdate=23 December 2014|date=15 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Evans|first1=Bradford|title=Standup Brooks Wheelan Hired to Write for 'SNL'|url=http://splitsider.com/2013/08/standup-brooks-wheelan-hired-to-write-for-'snl'/|website=Splitsider|accessdate=23 December 2014|date=26 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being fired from ''Saturday Night Live'', Wheelan embarked on a stand-up tour entitled 'Brooks Wheelan Falls Back On Standup Comedy (sorta) Tour', in reference to his firing. As part of his promotion for the tour he performed on ''[[Conan (talk show)|Conan]]''.

Wheelan's first stand-up comedy album ''This is Cool, Right?'' was released on 27 January 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|user=brookswheelan|author=Brooks Wheelan|number=543881437452066816|date=13 December 2014|title=Cover art for my first comedy album, "This is cool, right?" Pick it up JANUARY 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; to critical acclaim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Staff|first1=Laugh Button|title=Top Comedy Albums of 2015|url=http://thelaughbutton.com/features/2015-review-best-comedy-albums-specials-10-1/7/|website=Laugh Button|accessdate=18 December 2015|date=18 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Staff|first1=Paste|title=10 Best Comedy Albums of 2015|url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2015/12/the-10-best-comedy-albums-of-2015.html|website=Paste|accessdate=12 December 2015|date=12 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Laugh Button called it, "One of the best albums of 2015."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Staff|first1=Laugh Button|title=Top Comedy Albums of 2015|url=http://thelaughbutton.com/features/2015-review-best-comedy-albums-specials-10-1/7/|website=Laugh Button|accessdate=18 December 2015|date=18 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the A.V. Club wrote, "''This Is Cool, Right?'' is at turns manic, honest, and completely absurd. Brooks crafts jokes not unlike sketches, and has an ear for storytelling that finds universal truths in the examining of his personal life." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fowle|first1=Kyle|title=Brooks Wheelan goes absurd, honest on debut album This Is Cool, Right?|url=http://www.avclub.com/review/brooks-wheelan-goes-absurd-honest-debut-album-cool-215101|website=A.V. Club|accessdate=12 February 2015|date=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the promotion for the record, he appeared on ''[[Late Night with Seth Meyers]]''. Wheelan also has a [[Comedy Central]] half-hour stand-up special airing in summer 2015.

===''Saturday Night Live''===
Wheelan was a recurring guest on ''Saturday Night Live''{{'}}s "[[Weekend Update]]," using his stand-up stories as [[public service announcement]]s against irresponsible behavior. On the [[Bruce Willis]] / [[Katy Perry]] episode, the commentary centered on having tattoos that have no meaning, with Wheelan showing off three tattoos he had in his youth: A tribal stamp on his left arm meant to look like the one [[Anthony Kiedis]] from [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] has, a nautical star on his right arm, and a weird oceanscape on his side (which came from a doodle he drew in his freshman year of high school, and which does not make sense to him because he grew up in Iowa, which is not a coastal state). On the [[Anna Kendrick]] / [[Pharrell Williams]] episode, the commentary centered on the dangers of drinking alcohol, and the story of how his friends put [[butter]] down his pants while he was [[Blackout (drug-related amnesia)|blacked out]] drunk and Wheelan worrying that he was dying of an undiscovered [[Sexually transmitted infection|sexually transmitted disease]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

On July 14, 2014, Wheelan announced through [[Twitter]] that he was no longer a cast member of ''Saturday Night Live'', stating, "FIRED FROM NEW YORK IT'S SATURDAY NIGHT!".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barsanti|first1=Sam|title=Saturday Night Live has fired Brooks Wheelan|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/brooks-wheelan-fired-saturday-night-live-206907|website=A.V. Club|accessdate=23 December 2014|date=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A couple of days later, Wheelan admitted that he was not angry and that he is still close to some of the cast members. He claimed that he prefers stand-up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gP80WQf9Cgg|title=Brooks Wheelan Talks About Getting Fired From SNL - No You Shut Up!|publisher=No You Shut Up!|website=[[YouTube]]|date=July 28, 2014|accessdate=October 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
