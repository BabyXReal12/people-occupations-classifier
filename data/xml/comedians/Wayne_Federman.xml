==Life and career==

===Early years: 1959–1976===
Federman was born in Los Angeles, one of six children. He grew up in [[Silver Spring, Maryland]], and moved to [[Plantation, Florida]] at age 10. He played the drums and at age 14 began performing in a band at local weddings. He taught himself [[ventriloquism]] and performed at various school ([[South Plantation High School]]) functions as well as local churches and service organizations. He delivered his high school's sports results on Miami radio station [[WWOK]]. He made his local television debut on [[WPLG]]'s ''Youth and the Issue'' debating the death penalty. In 1976, Federman worked as an extra in [[John Frankenheimer]]'s ''[[Black Sunday (1977 film)|Black Sunday]]'', shot at the [[Miami Orange Bowl]].

===New York City: 1977–1986===
In the fall of 1977, Federman was accepted into the [[Tisch School of the Arts]] at [[New York University]]. There he studied with legendary acting coach [[Stella Adler]]. He performed his own show, ''Comedy Tonight'', at the Eisner and Lubin Auditorium, with future Broadway star [[Donna Murphy]].

[[File:Ukeshot.jpeg|right|thumb|170px|Federman with electric ukulele, circa 1987]]
After college Federman brought his one-man show to the 13th Street Theater. There he performed in rotation with [[Brother Theodore]]. He also starred in the theater's production of ''[[Snow White|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'', in which he played six roles. Soon he was performing stand-up comedy at various New York Comedy Clubs, most notably The Comic Strip (now known as [[Comic Strip Live]]) and [[Catch a Rising Star (comedy clubs)|Catch a Rising Star]]. It was during these years that he incorporated music into his act. He closed his sets by playing hard rock tunes from [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Iron Butterfly]], and [[The Rolling Stones]] on his electric [[ukulele]].

Federman made his national television debut on the syndicated stand-up program ''[[Comedy Tonight]]'' in 1986. He also appeared in two home videos: ''New Wave Comedy'' and the ''Dodge Comedy Showcase''.

===Hollywood: 1987–2008===
In 1987, Federman moved to Los Angeles and began working at [[The Improv]], IGBYs, [[The Laugh Factory]], and [[The Comedy &amp; Magic Club]].  He taped a series of televised stand-up performances, including ''[[An Evening at the Improv]]'', ''[[George Schlatter's Comedy Club]]'', ''[[CBS Morning Show]]'', ''[[2 Drink Minimum]]'', ''[[Star Search]]'', ''[[Good Times Cafe]]'', ''[[The A-List (2007 TV series)|The A-List]]'', and ''[[MTV ½ Hour Comedy Hour]]''. He toured extensively, performing at over 200 colleges.  He co-founded the improvisational group "No Fat Guy" with Marc Raider, Scott LaRose, and Steve Hytner, and later briefly formed a music-comedy team with Jordan Brady.

Federman began booking television commercials and appeared in dozens of national spots for clients, including Eureka Vacuums, Holiday Inn, U.S. Navy, Wendy's, Taboo, Eagle cars (with [[Greg Kinnear]]), McDonald's, Glad Bags, Sprite, Total Raisin Bran, Ford, U.S. Olympic Team, [[Suzuki Samurai]], [[Sizzler]], Del Monte, U.S. Cellular, Coors, and 7–11. He gained some prominence as the first "not exactly" guy in the long-running [[Hertz Rent A Car]] campaign. Federman began landing small television parts on ''[[Baywatch]]'', ''[[Amen]]'', ''[[Dear John (U.S. TV series)|Dear John]]'', ''[[A Different World (TV series)|A Different World]]'', ''[[Doogie Howser]]'', and ''[[NewsRadio|News Radio]]''. He had recurring roles on ''[[L.A. Law]]'' (3 episodes) and ''[[Living Single]]'' (3 episodes).

In 1992, Federman made his debut on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' and has subsequently appeared many times on the program. He also appeared on ''[[Late Fridays]]'', ''[[Comedy Showcase]]'', and ''[[Premium Blend]]''.  In 2004, he taped his own 1/2-hour stand-up special for the series, ''[[Comedy Central Presents]]''.

In 1998, Wayne appeared as Larry Sander's brother Stan, and was later reunited with [[Garry Shandling]] on ''[[The X-Files]]'' episode "[[Hollywood A.D. (The X-Files)|Hollywood A.D.]]". Written and directed by [[David Duchovny]], the creative episode followed "Wayne Federman", a Hollywood producer/writer and college friend of assistant FBI director [[Walter Skinner]].

Television led Wayne to film roles in ''[[Jack Frost (1998 film)|Jack Frost]]'', ''[[Dill Scallion]]'', ''[[Legally Blonde]]'', ''[[50 First Dates]]'', ''[[Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle]]'', ''[[The 40-Year-Old Virgin]]'', ''[[Unaccompanied Minors]]'', ''[[Knocked Up]]'', ''[[Step Brothers (film)|Step Brothers]]'', and ''[[Funny People]]''.

Beginning in 2007, Federman wrote, produced, and hosted an annual holiday variety show entitled ''A Very Federman Christmas'' at the Los Angeles nightclub [[Largo (nightclub)|Largo]].

===Voiceover work===
In 1990, while shooting a television commercial campaign for McDonald's (directed by [[Henry Winkler]]), Federman recorded a series of tie-in radio commercials. This launched his [[voice-over]] career. Since then his distinctive voice has been heard on hundreds of radio and television spots. He was the voice of the talking ham and cheese sandwich in the long-running Florida Orange Juice campaign.

He also provided voices for the animated series ''[[The Wild Thornberrys]]'',  ''[[King of the Hill]]'', and ''[[American Dad!]]'', as well as the voice of Cartoon Cartoon Friday on the ''[[Cartoon Network]]''.

In 2007, Federman voiced a series of [[Labatt]] Beer commercials, portraying a fish, a deer, a boulder, and slab of ice. This ad was eventually pulled and re-edited when viewers complained of the implied vulgarity.

In 2015, Federman voiced a camel (Phil) in a [[GEICO]] insurance commercial.

===The Pete Maravich Project===

In July 2010, Federman was part of the last comedians to tour and perform for U.S. combat troops throughout Iraq during [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]].
