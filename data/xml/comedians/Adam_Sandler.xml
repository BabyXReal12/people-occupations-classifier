'''Adam Richard Sandler''' (born September 9, 1966) is an American actor, comedian, screenwriter, and film producer. After becoming a ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' cast member, Sandler went on to star in many Hollywood feature films that combined have grossed over $2 billion at the box office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/people/?view=Actor&amp;sort=sumgross&amp;p=.htm |title=People Index |website=BoxOfficeMojo.com |accessdate=April 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is best known for his roles in the films ''[[Billy Madison]]'' (1995), the sports comedies ''[[Happy Gilmore]]'' (1996) and ''[[The Waterboy]]'' (1998), the romantic comedy ''[[The Wedding Singer]]'' (1998), ''[[Big Daddy (1999 film)|Big Daddy]]'' (1999), and ''[[Mr. Deeds]]'' (2002), and voicing [[Count Dracula|Dracula]] in ''[[Hotel Transylvania]]'' (2012), ''[[Hotel Transylvania 2]]'' (2015), and ''[[Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation]]'' (2018). Several of his films, most notably the widely panned ''[[Jack and Jill (2011 film)|Jack and Jill]]'', have gained harsh criticism, culminating in a shared second place in the number of [[Raspberry Awards]] (3) and Raspberry Award nominations (11), in both cases second only to [[Sylvester Stallone]]. He has ventured into more dramatic territory with his roles in ''[[Punch-Drunk Love]]'' (2002), ''[[Spanglish (film)|Spanglish]]'' (2004), ''[[Reign Over Me]]'' (2007), ''[[Funny People]]'' (2009), and ''[[The Meyerowitz Stories]]'' (2017), all of which earned him critical praise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cea|first=Max|url=https://www.salon.com/2017/10/12/noah-baumbach-performs-a-miracle-adam-sandler-doesnt-suck-in-the-meyerowitz-stories/|title=Noah Baumbach performs a miracle: Adam Sandler doesn’t suck in 'The Meyerowitz Stories''|work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]|date=October 12, 2017|accessdate=April 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==

=== Acting career ===
[[File:Adamsandler(cannesPhotocall).jpg|thumb|Sandler at 2002 [[Cannes Film Festival]]]]
Early in his career, in 1987, Sandler played [[Theo Huxtable]]'s friend, Smitty in ''[[The Cosby Show]]'' and the Stud Boy or Trivia Delinquent in the [[Game show|MTV game show]] ''[[Remote Control (game show)|Remote Control]]''. After his film debut ''[[Going Overboard]]'' in 1989, Sandler performed in comedy clubs, having first taken the stage at his brother's urging when he was 17. He was discovered by comedian [[Dennis Miller]], who caught Sandler's act in Los Angeles and recommended him to ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' producer [[Lorne Michaels]]. Sandler was hired as a writer for ''SNL'' in 1990 and became a featured player the following year, making a name for himself by performing amusing original songs on the show, including "[[The Thanksgiving Song]]" and "[[The Chanukah Song]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.biography.com/people/adam-sandler-9542505|title= Adam Sandler Biography: Film Actor, Singer, Songwriter, Comedian, Screenwriter (1966–)| website=Biography.com ([[A&amp;E Networks]])| accessdate=December 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sandler told [[Conan O'Brien]] on ''[[The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien|The Tonight Show]]'' that [[NBC]] fired him and [[Chris Farley]] from the show in 1995.&lt;ref name="Sandler fired"&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/2010/01/21/2010-01-21_youre_not_alone_conan_obrien_adam_sandler_says_nbc_fired_him_and_chris_farley_fr.html | title= You're not alone, Conan O'Brien: Adam Sandler says NBC fired him and Chris Farley from 'SNL'| first= Joe |last=Dziemianowicz| work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]] | location=New York City |date= January 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, Adam Sandler appeared in the film ''[[Coneheads (film)|Coneheads]]'' with Chris Farley, [[David Spade]], [[Dan Aykroyd]], [[Phil Hartman]], and [[Jane Curtin]]. In 1994, he co-starred in ''[[Airheads]]'' with [[Brendan Fraser]] and [[Steve Buscemi]]. He starred in ''[[Billy Madison]]'' (1995) playing a grown man repeating grades 1–12 to earn back his father's respect and the right to inherit his father's multimillion-dollar hotel empire; the film received negative reviews. He followed this film with ''[[Bulletproof (1996 film)|Bulletproof]]'' (1996), and the financially successful comedies ''Happy Gilmore'' (1996) and ''The Wedding Singer'' (1998). He was initially cast in the bachelor-party-themed comedy/thriller ''[[Very Bad Things]]'' (1998) but had to back out due to his involvement in ''[[The Waterboy]]'' (1998), one of his first hits.

Although his earliest films did not receive critical praise, he started to receive more positive reviews, beginning with ''Punch-Drunk Love'' in 2002. [[Roger Ebert]]'s review of ''Punch-Drunk Love'' concluded that Sandler had been wasted in earlier films with poorly written scripts and characters with no development.&lt;ref&gt;Ebert, Roger. [http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20021018/REVIEWS/210180308/1023 "Punch-Drunk Love."] ''Chicago Sun-Times''. October 18, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Sandler has moved outside the genre of slapstick comedy to take on more serious parts such as the aforementioned ''[[Punch-Drunk Love]]'' (for which he was nominated for a [[Golden Globe]]) and [[Mike Binder]]'s ''[[Reign Over Me]]'' (2007), a drama about a man who loses his entire family in [[9/11]] and rekindles a friendship with his old college roommate ([[Don Cheadle]]).

He starred alongside friend [[Kevin James]] in the film ''[[I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry]]'' (2007), and headlined ''[[You Don't Mess with the Zohan]]'' (2008). The film was written by Sandler, [[Judd Apatow]], and [[Robert Smigel]], and it was directed by [[Dennis Dugan]].

[[File:Adam Sandler 6818.jpg|thumb|left|Sandler in [[Berlin]] 2009]]
Sandler starred along with [[Keri Russell]] and English comedian [[Russell Brand]] in [[Adam Shankman]]'s fantasy film ''[[Bedtime Stories (film)|Bedtime Stories]]'' (2008), as a stressed hotel maintenance worker whose bedtime stories he reads to his niece and nephew begin to come true. It marked as Sandler's first family film and first film under the [[The Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney]] banner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=19719 |title=Adam Sandler's Bedtime Stories Come True| website=ComingSoon.net | date= April 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Sandler starred in Judd Apatow's third directorial feature ''[[Funny People]]''. The film was released on July 31, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Michael Fleming | title = Trio joins Judd Apatow film |work=Variety | date = June 11, 2008 | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117987337.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1 | accessdate=June 13, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080709034441/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117987337.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1| archivedate=July 9, 2008&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the release of ''Funny People'', it, along with ''Punch-Drunk Love'' were cited in the June 2010 announcement that Sandler was one of 135 people (including 20 actors) invited to join the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.oscars.org/press/pressreleases/2010/20100625.html | title= Academy Invites 135 to Membership | publisher=[[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] | work=[[Press release]] | date= June 25, 2010 | location= Beverly Hills, CA | accessdate=June 29, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100630164148/http://www.oscars.org/press/pressreleases/2010/20100625.html| archivedate= June 30, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sandler also voiced a capuchin monkey in Kevin James's ''[[Zookeeper (film)|Zookeeper]]'', released on July 8, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1222817/|title=Zookeeper (2011)|author=Stephen Cook|date=July 8, 2011|work=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, he starred in ''[[That's My Boy (2012 film)|That's My Boy]]'', as a man who fathered a son ([[Andy Samberg]]) with his teacher in high school.

Sandler's recent comedy films, including ''Grown Ups'' and ''Grown Ups 2'', have received strongly negative reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/grown-ups-2-best-lines-584676|title='Grown Ups 2': The Best Lines from the Worst Reviews|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=July 12, 2013|accessdate=May 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reviewing the latter, critic Mark Olsen of ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'' remarked that Sandler had become the antithesis of [[Judd Apatow]]; he was instead "the white [[Tyler Perry]]: smart enough to know better, savvy enough to do it anyway, lazy enough not to care."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-grown-ups-2-review-20130712-story.html|title='Review: 'Grown Ups 2' refuses to leave the sandbox|work=The Los Angeles Times|date=July 11, 2013|accessdate=May 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
