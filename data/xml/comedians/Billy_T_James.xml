'''William James Te Wehi Taitoko'''&lt;ref name=NZOS_Bio/&gt; {{post-nominals|country=NZL|MBE}} (17 January 1948 – 7 August 1991) better known by his stage name '''Billy T. James''', was a [[New Zealand]] entertainer, comedian, musician and actor. He became a key figure in the development of New Zealand comedy,&lt;ref name = billy-on-screen&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nzonscreen.com/person/billy-t-james |title=Bill T James: Overview |website=NZ On Screen}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a household name during his lifetime.

==Early life==

Taitoko was of [[Waikato Tainui]]&lt;ref name = billy-on-screen /&gt; and [[Clan Campbell]]&lt;ref name = funny-fulla&gt;
{{cite web |url= http://www.noted.co.nz/archive/listener-nz-2009/funny-fulla/ |title=Funny fulla |website=New Zealand Listener}}&lt;/ref&gt; descent, leading him to reflect humorously in one routine, "I'm half Maori and half Scots. Half of me wants to go to the pub and get pissed, and the other half doesn't want to pay for it.".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9vV61McLy_YC&amp;dq=I%27m+half+Maori+and+half+Scots.+Half+of+me+wants+to+go+to+the+pub+and+get+pissed%2C+and+the+other+half+doesn%27t+want+to+pay+for+it.&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22I%27m+half+Maori+and+half+Scots.+Half+of+me+wants+to+go+to+the+pub+and+get+pissed%2C+and+the+other+half+doesn%27t+want+to+pay+for+it.%22 ''Xenophobe's Guide to the Kiwis''], Anne Taute, Christine Cole Catley
Ravette Publishing, Limited, 1996, page 34&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Taitoko joined the [[Maori Volcanics Showband]] in the 1970s&lt;ref name=NZOS_Bio&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nzonscreen.com/person/billy-t-james/biography |title=Bill T James: Biography |website=NZ On Screen}}&lt;/ref&gt; and performed around the world. [[Prince Tui Teka]] encouraged him to embark on a solo career&lt;ref name="NZHerald"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501119&amp;objectid=11898836|title=Billy T James' Death Left Huge Gap In NZ Culture|publisher=''[[New Zealand Herald]]''|date= 7 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which saw him in great demand for his skits and impressions and his cabaret singing.  He adopted the stage name Billy T. James because "it was something the Australians could pronounce".

In 1980 he appeared in the variety show Radio Times, the success of which led to his own comedy sketch show in 1981, [[#The Billy T James Show|The Billy T James Show]] (see section).  The same year he was named New Zealand Entertainer of the Year.&lt;ref name="NZHerald"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985 his cabaret act was recorded live and released on LP as "Billy T Live! at Pips Cabaret, Whangarei".  Featuring standup comedy selections and live versions of songs such as [[Running Bear]] and [[When A Child Is Born]], this title was out-of-print for more than a decade before being re-released in CD format in 2008.

He made a notable appearance in the 1985 feature film ''[[Came a Hot Friday]]'' and provided voice-talent for the popular animated film ''[[Footrot Flats: The Dog's Tail]]''.  Also in 1985 Billy was named New Zealand Entertainer of the Decade.

In 1986 James was appointed as a member of the [[Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire|Order of the British Empire]] for services to entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;''New Year Honours 1986'' (9 January 1986) 3 [[New Zealand Gazette]] 87 at 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986 Billy and [[Chris Slane]] published "Real Hard Case" which contained comic-strip interpretations of Billy's comedy. "Real Hard Case 2" followed in 1987.

During this period his name and likeness was used for the company "Billy T's Hangi Takeaways," with locations in Auckland, but the business did not last and closed after several years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.companiesnz.com/company/526806/billy-ts-hangi-takeaways-limited BILLY T'S HANGI TAKEAWAYS LIMITED - AUCKLAND - NEW ZEALAND]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990 Billy received the prestigious [[Benny Award]] from the [[Variety Artists Club of New Zealand|Variety Artists Club of New Zealand Inc]] for a lifetime of excellence in the performing arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vacnz.com/bennyaward/|title=Variety Artists Club of NZ Benny Award Information and Recipients|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016033941/http://www.vacnz.com/bennyaward/|archivedate=16 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Billy T James Show==
Billy T James self-titled television show for [[TVNZ]] featured sketch comedy and live performances of standup comedy and songs. The show lasted seven series and became a New Zealand institution. Joining Billy in the first series were regulars Doug Aston and Laurie Dee. Sadly almost all of the first (1981) and second series (1982) were [[Wiping|wiped]] by TVNZ, with no known copies existing, only one episode from each of the first two series still exist in the TVNZ archive. The second series saw Billy introduce his first recurring character Pierre the Painter, who would paint pictures while telling a story. The third series, the first to survive in full saw the introduction of a parody of the Maori news show [[Te Karere]] entitled Te News in Episode 3, however this would not appear again until two years later during Series 5.  The black singlet and yellow towel Billy wore in these sketches were to become iconic. After the 1984 series, Doug Aston and Laurie Dee, along with many of the writers, were dropped.  The fifth and sixth series (1985 and 1986 respectively were co-written by [[Peter Rowley]] and included parodies of ''[[Miami Vice]], [[Play School (New Zealand TV series)|Playschool]],'' a 'Lands For Bags' television commercial and sketches featuring Rowley as Captain Cook.

Series 1 and 2 most likely ran for 6 half-hour episodes each in 1981 and 1982. Series 3 ran for 7 half-hour episodes in 1983, and Series 4 ran for 6 half-hour episodes in 1984.

Later Billy starred in a second television show also titled [[The Billy T James Show]]. It screened on [[TV3 (New Zealand)|TV3]] and was based on a format devised by Billy and Tom Parkinson.  Abandoning the popular sketch comedy format, this show was a family sitcom format and effectively starred Billy as himself.  Co-starring were [[Ilona Rodgers]] and [[Mark Hadlow]], with Mark Wright, Tania Wehi and Willa O'Neill. It ran for one season with only average audience ratings and reviews.{{citation needed | date = July 2012}}

==Deteriorating health, transplant and death==

In 1988 James suffered a major heart attack and underwent a quadruple bypass operation. The operation was not successful, and in November 1989 he received a heart transplant. He returned to the stage of the [[Aotea Centre]] in April 1990 for the variety special ''Billy T James, Alive and Gigging''. [[Howard Morrison]] appeared as a special guest.

James' health deteriorated again shortly afterwards, and he became ill with heart failure in February 1991.  He died at Greenlane Hospital in Auckland on 7 August 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501119&amp;objectid=11898836|title=Billy T James' Death Left Huge Gap In NZ Culture|website=Herald Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Billy is survived by his adopted daughter Cherie James, herself an award-nominated actress and presenter of the 1997 documentary, "A Daughter's Story" about her father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzonscreen.com/title/billy-t-james-a-daughters-story-1997|title=A Daughter's Story | publisher = NZ On Screen | year = 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy, recent biographies and documentaries==

The [[Billy T Award]] was founded in 1997 in honour of James.  It is New Zealand's most prestigious comedy award,{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} recognising comedians with outstanding potential.  Winners are presented with a yellow towel, Billy's trademark from his "Te News" sketches.

In 2009, nearly 50% of respondents voted him the country's greatest comedian in a [[New Zealand Listener]] survey,&lt;ref name = billy-on-screen /&gt; eighteen years after his death.

The first biography of James was released in 2009.  Entitled ''The Life and Times of Billy T. James'', it was written by [[Matt Elliott (comedian)|Matt Elliott]] and was based upon interviews with more than fifty friends and colleagues of Billy as well as wife Lynn and sister Ngaire.

In December 2010, funding was given for the production of a biographical film based on Billy T. James' life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzonair.govt.nz/news/newspressreleases/pressrelease_2010_12_21.aspx |title=New Platinum Fund TV projects announced |date=21 December 2010 |publisher=NZ On Air – Press release |accessdate=15 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140219171519/http://www.nzonair.govt.nz/news/newspressreleases/pressrelease_2010_12_21.aspx |archivedate=19 February 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2011, it was revealed the film was to be titled ''Billy'' and would star Tainui Tukiwaho as Billy and [[Morgana O'Reilly]] as wife Lynn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| issn = 1170-0777| last = Morton| first = Frances| title = Two looks at life of our favourite comic Billy T| work = New Zealand Herald| accessdate = | date = 20 March 2011| url = http://www.nzherald.co.nz/television/news/article.cfm?c_id=339&amp;objectid=10713691}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film premiered on 21 August 2011 on [[TV One (New Zealand)|TV One]].  Liberties were taken for dramatic purposes including arguments with co-writer and television partner [[Peter Rowley]] and a minor heart-attack while filming, neither of which occurred. Both Peter Rowley and James' daughter criticised the inaccuracies of the production in the press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onfilm.co.nz/2011/08/26/billy-telefeature-under-fire-for-inaccuracies/|title=Onfilm.co.nz Article, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130209173013/http://www.onfilm.co.nz/2011/08/26/billy-telefeature-under-fire-for-inaccuracies/|archivedate=9 February 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Web of lies"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/television/news/article.cfm?c_id=339&amp;objectid=10747886|title=Billy T. drama "a web of lies" NZ Herald Article, 2011 | work=The New Zealand Herald | first=Bevan|last=Hurley|date=28 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A documentary entitled ''Billy T: Te Movie'' was released theatrically in August 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Director confident that Billy T's talent will be recognised | publisher = Radio New Zealand |date = 16 August 2011 | accessdate = 16 August 2011| url = http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/82615/director-confident-that-billy-t%27s-talent-will-be-recognised}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Directed by [[Ian Mune]], it proved popular with both theatre-goers and reviewers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onfilm.co.nz/2011/09/01/review-billy-t-te-movie/|title=Onfilm Te Movie Review|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130208100317/http://www.onfilm.co.nz/2011/09/01/review-billy-t-te-movie/|archivedate=8 February 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/film/5451481/Film-review-Billy-T-Te-Movie/|title=Stuff Te Movie Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flicks.co.nz/movie/billy-t-te-movie/|title=Flicks Te Movie Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; becoming the week's top box office performer on the week of release with $263,000 in sales.&lt;ref name = "Web of lies" /&gt;  ''Te Movie'' is now available on DVD.
