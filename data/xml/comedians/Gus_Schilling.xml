'''August "Gus" Schilling''' (June 20, 1908 — June 16, 1957) was an American film actor who started in [[burlesque]] comedy and usually played nervous comic roles, often unbilled. A friend of [[Orson Welles]], he appeared in five of the director's films — ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (first screen performance), ''[[The Magnificent Ambersons (film)|The Magnificent Ambersons]]'', ''[[The Lady from Shanghai]]'', ''[[Macbeth (1948 film)|Macbeth]]'' and ''[[Touch of Evil]]'' (final performance, released posthumously).&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1939/08/31/93952534.html?pageNumber=21 Churchill, Douglas W. "Screen News Here and in Hollywood / Gus Schilling First Choice for Role in Welles–RKO Film, 'Heart of Darkness'" (''The New York Times'', August 31, 1939, p.14)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Born in [[New York City]], Schilling had a rubber face and flustered gestures which made him a natural comedian and he began his career understudying comedy stars [[Bert Lahr]] and [[Joe Penner]] on Broadway. He soon became a favorite among burlesque comedians, who welcomed him into the burlesque profession. Schilling married burlesque star Betty Rowland and the couple toured in the [[Minsky's Burlesque|Minsky]] burlesque troupe.

[[Orson Welles]] saw Schilling in New York and followed him to [[Florida]]. There Welles hired Schilling to appear in a stage production featuring several Shakespearean scenes. "I learned my part by taking the script to Welles and having him translate the lines to everyday English," Schilling recalled in 1939. Welles promised Schilling a part in Welles's first motion picture, and kept his promise: Schilling is featured in ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1941).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Orson Welles Should Be Smiling Now|last=Delmont|first=Jim|date=November 2, 1998|work=[[Omaha World-Herald]]|page=33|quote=Welles was obviously having a good time directing, pulling into minor roles some old buddies, including...Gus Schilling (a veteran of Welles' "Citizen Kane," "Ambersons" and "The Lady From Shanghai")|accessdate=July 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This established Schilling in Hollywood movies as a "nervous" comedian (he plays a jittery symphony conductor in [[Olsen and Johnson]]'s ''[[Hellzapoppin' (musical)|Hellzapoppin']]'', for example). He also co-starred with character comedian [[Richard Lane (actor)|Richard Lane]] in a series of 11 comedy shorts for [[Columbia Pictures]]; the series ran from 1945 to 1950.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1945/07/18/88260790.html?pageNumber=21 Special to the New York Times. "Grofe Will Write Music for Films" (''The New York Times'', July 18, 1945, p.21)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In July 1945 Schilling was arrested in Hollywood on charges of possession of narcotics. At his trial he testified that he admitted ownership of the marijuana to save his wife from arrest. The all-woman jury acquitted Schilling on November 29.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/412810781.html?dids=412810781:412810781&amp;FMT=CITE&amp;FMTS=CITE:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Nov+29%2C+1945&amp;author=&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;desc=Heiress+Has+Baby+Daughter&amp;pqatl=google|title=Heiress Has Baby Daughter|date=November 29, 1945|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|quote=Gus Schilling, actor-husband of Betty Rowland, burlesque's "Ball of Fire," was found innocent of charges of possessing narcotics yesterday by an all...|accessdate=July 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schilling's marriage to Betty Rowland ended in divorce. His professional career remained successful, and he worked in movies and television throughout the 1950s. His final film, Welles's ''[[Touch of Evil]]'', in which he has a brief uncredited appearance, was released in May 1958, nearly a year after his death.

Schilling died of a heart attack in his Hollywood apartment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/437113472.html?dids=437113472:437113472&amp;FMT=CITE&amp;FMTS=CITE:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Jun+17%2C+1957&amp;author=&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;desc=Gus+Schilling%2C+Comedian%2C+Dies+in+Home&amp;pqatl=google|title=Gus Schilling, Comedian, Dies in Home|date=June 17, 1957|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|quote=Comedian August Gus Schilling 49 was found dead apparently of a heart attack yesterday morning in his apartment|accessdate=4 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1957/06/17/84968750.html?pageNumber=23 Special to The New York Times.
