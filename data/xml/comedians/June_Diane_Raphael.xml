She also co-hosts the popular movie discussion podcast ''[[How Did This Get Made?]]'' alongside [[Jason Mantzoukas]] and her husband [[Paul Scheer]]. 

==Early life==
{{onesource|section|date=November 2017}}
Raphael was born and raised in [[Rockville Centre, New York]], to Diane and John Raphael, where she graduated from [[South Side High School (Rockville Centre, New York)|South Side High School]] in 1998. She is of Irish descent, and was raised [[Catholic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nerdist.com/2013/10/you-made-it-weird-181-june-diane-raphael |title=You Made It Weird #181: June Diane Raphael |website=Nerdist.com |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has two older sisters, Lauren and Deanna.

Raphael attended [[New York University]] (NYU), where she studied acting at NYU's [[Tisch School of the Arts]] and the [[Stella Adler Studio of Acting]]. After graduating from NYU in 2002, Raphael and her best friend from college, [[Casey Wilson]], studied improvisational comedy at the [[Upright Citizens Brigade Theater]] in New York City, where they would eventually run their two-woman sketch show for a number of years. Performing the long-running stage show opened doors for them as writers. After performing the show at the "U.S. Comedy Arts Festival" in 2005, they were hired by [[New Regency Productions|New Regency Pictures]] to write the film ''[[Bride Wars]]'' and landed a development deal with [[UPN]] to create a sitcom pilot.

==Career==
Raphael began her comedy career writing and performing with the [[Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre]] (UCB) in New York and later in Los Angeles. Among her best known work at UCB, was the long-running sketch show ''Rode Hard and Put Away Wet'', written and performed alongside her comedy partner and best friend [[Casey Wilson]]; the stage show ran from 2003 to 2006 in New York and Los Angeles and was an official selection at 2005's [[US Comedy Arts Festival]] in [[Aspen, Colorado]]. The two women, who had first met in a clowning class during their freshman year at NYU, went on to win the [[ECNY Awards|ECNY Award]] for "Best Comedy Duo" in 2005. They also performed as members of the UCB [[improvisational comedy|improv]] teams "Mr. and Mrs. All-Star", "Sentimental Lady", and "Hey, Uncle Gary!". Raphael and Wilson's comedic partnership has since branched out into an active writing career in film and television, they co-wrote their first screenplay for the comedy ''[[Bride Wars]]'', which they also appeared in with supporting roles, followed by landing a development deal with [[UPN]] in 2005 to create a half-hour comedy pilot and in 2007 they worked as writers and story editors on the [[United States|Americanized]] version of ''[[Creature Comforts]]'' on CBS. They also continue to contribute comedic videos to the humor website [[Funny or Die]].

As a film and television actress, Raphael has made guest appearances on shows such as ''[[Party Down]]'', ''[[Happy Endings (TV series)|Happy Endings]]'', ''[[Animal Practice]]'', ''[[American Dad!]]'', ''[[Kroll Show]]'', ''[[Funny or Die Presents]]'', ''[[Big Lake (TV series)|Big Lake]]'', ''[[Drunk History]]'', ''[[Flight of the Conchords (TV series)|Flight of the Conchords]]'' and currently recurs as Dr. Sadie on the [[FOX]] sitcom ''[[New Girl]]''. She has appeared in films such as ''[[Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues]]'', ''[[Girl Most Likely]]'', ''[[Unfinished Business (2015 film)|Unfinished Business]]'', ''[[Going the Distance (2010 film)|Going the Distance]]'', ''[[Zodiac (film)|Zodiac]]'', ''[[Bachelorette (film)|Bachelorette]]'',  ''[[Forgetting Sarah Marshall]]'' and ''[[Year One (film)|Year One]]''. In 2010, Raphael co-starred as Barb in the improvised comedy series ''[[Players (2010 TV series)|Players]]'' on [[Spike TV]]. She also starred in all three seasons of the web series ''[[Burning Love (Web series)|Burning Love]]'' alongside [[Ken Marino]] and [[Michael Ian Black]]. [[Image:Casey Wilson 2013 1.jpg|thumb|250px|Raphael (right) and [[Casey Wilson]] (left) with ''[[Ass Backwards]]'' director Chris Nelson at the 2013 [[Outfest]] film festival.]]

Raphael continues to collaborate with writing partner [[Casey Wilson]] on scripts for film and television, they have worked on numerous script rewrites for films in development, such as projects with [[Anna Faris]] and [[America Ferrera]] attached to star. As writer-performers, Raphael and Wilson also continue to generate material for themselves. They most recently wrote and starred together in the raunchy female buddy comedy ''[[Ass Backwards]]'', which also co-stars [[Alicia Silverstone]], [[Jon Cryer]], [[Vincent D'Onofrio]], [[Paul Scheer]], and [[Bob Odenkirk]]. The film premiered at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] on January 21, 2013. Raphael and Wilson are working on a second film to star in together, produced by [[Will Ferrell]] and [[Adam McKay]]'s company [[Gary Sanchez Productions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Yamato |first=Jen |url=http://www.deadline.com/2013/11/gary-sanchez-springs-for-june-diane-raphael-casey-wilson-feature-pitch/ |title=Gary Sanchez Springs For June Diane Raphael &amp; Casey Wilson Feature Pitch |publisher=Deadline.com |date=2013-11-18 |accessdate=2014-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2010, Raphael joined the rotating cast of the [[Off-Broadway]] play ''[[Love, Loss, and What I Wore]]'' (written by [[Nora Ephron]] and [[Delia Ephron]]) at the [[Westside Theatre]] in Manhattan. Raphael and Casey Wilson have created their newest comedic stage show ''The Realest Real Housewives'', which they star in alongside [[Jessica St. Clair]], [[Melissa Rauch]], [[Danielle Schneider]] and Morgan Walsh. The show began running monthly at the Los Angeles [[Upright Citizens Brigade]] Theatre in 2011. Raphael also contributed short stories to the 2010 book "''Worst Laid Plans''", based on the long-running stage show, which she frequently performed in.

Raphael co-starred in the [[Adult Swim]] action-comedy series ''[[NTSF:SD:SUV::]]'', which aired for three seasons from 2011 to 2013. She currently co-hosts with her husband, [[Paul Scheer]], the movie discussion podcast ''[[How Did This Get Made?]]'' along with comedian [[Jason Mantzoukas]]. The podcast is a roundtable discussion where Scheer, Raphael, Mantzoukas and other special guests "try make sense of movies that make absolutely no sense." Raphael is also a huge fanatic of the film ''[[Grease 2]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earwolf.com/show/how-did-get-made |title=How Did This Get Made? podcast on Earwolf |website=Earwolf.com |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Raphael is married to actor-comedian [[Paul Scheer]].

They moved from New York to Los Angeles in 2005. In October 2009, they married at the [[Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Westhoff |first=Ben |url=http://blogs.laweekly.com/arts/2013/02/paul_scheer_june_diane_raphael_how_did_this_get_made_podcast_couples_2013.php |title=Paul Scheer and June Diane Raphael: Comedians Who Bond Over Terrible Hollywood Movies &amp;#124; L.A.
