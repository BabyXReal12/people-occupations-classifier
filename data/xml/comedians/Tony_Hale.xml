==Early life==
Hale was born in [[West Point, New York|West Point]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. His mother, Rita (née Garnett), worked as a staff assistant to State Representative [[Kathy Ashe]], and his father, Mike Hale, taught nuclear and atomic physics and served in the military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jonathan Davis |url=http://www.mga.edu/news-bureau/msctoday/spring02/match.aspx |title=MSC Today - Macon State College |publisher=Mga.edu |date=1981-01-01 |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=MT&amp;s_site=macon&amp;p_multi=MT&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0FEB829CEB9B9CF4&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM |title='Hale' to the comedy chief |publisher=Nl.newsbank.com |accessdate=2013-10-26 |date=November 9, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hale grew up in [[Tallahassee]], [[Florida]], where he attended the Young Actors Theatre and participated in numerous theatrical and musical productions. He graduated from [[Leon High School]] in 1988. He graduated from [[Samford University]] in [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], [[Alabama]], where he became a member of [[Sigma Chi]] Fraternity, with a journalism degree in 1992. He completed graduate studies in 1995 from the School of Communication and the Arts of [[Regent University]] in [[Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wilson|first1=Brett|title=Reasons Tony Hale '95 Says, "Your Next Big Thing is Here"|url=http://www.regent.edu/news_events/?article_id=1867&amp;view=full_article&amp;preview=true|website=Regent University|publisher=Regent University|accessdate=23 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating, he lived in New York City for nearly ten years. While in New York, Hale helped found The Haven, an artistically minded community of Christians that meets weekly. He also studied acting at [[The Barrow Group]], a New York City theatre company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=February 21, 2007|author= Birkner, Gabrielle|url= http://www.nysun.com/article/49005 |title= For These Artists, Inspiration Is Most Important|publisher= The New York Sun |accessdate=2007-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Hale first obtained his [[Screen Actors Guild]] card when he appeared in a commercial for [[MCI Inc.]], though it never aired.&lt;ref name=TVGuide&gt;"How Did You Get Your SAG-AFTRA Card?" ''[[TV Guide]]''. January 13, 2014. p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; He made minor guest appearances in TV shows such as ''[[Dawson's Creek]]'', ''[[The Sopranos]]'', and ''[[Sex and the City]]''. He is often recognized for his role in the famous [[Volkswagen]] television commercial aired in 1999, in which he danced to the song "[[Mr. Roboto]]", which was later spoofed on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] [[sitcom]] ''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]]''. From 2003 to 2006, and returning to the role in 2013, Hale found success in television when he was cast as [[Buster Bluth]], the hapless, neurotic son with "mother issues" on ''Arrested Development''. Hale also appeared in a season ten episode of ''MADtv'' in a parody of ''COPS'', where two British robbers try to stop a domestic dispute among the royal family.

In March 2006, Hale was cast in a co-starring role as the video store owner Simon in the NBC [[sitcom]] ''[[Andy Barker P.I.]]'', starring [[Andy Richter]] and co-created by [[Conan O'Brien]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=March 15, 2007|author=Heffernan, Virginia |url=http://atlanta.sixdegreesmag.com/content/view/222/460|title=The Standard Six with Tony Hale |publisher=Six Degrees Magazine|accessdate=2007-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; He appeared in minor roles in [[Stranger than Fiction (2006 film)|''Stranger Than Fiction'']] and [[Because I Said So (film)|''Because I Said So'']].

His departure made room for his starring role on the NBC web series ''[[Ctrl (web series)|Ctrl]]'', which premiered on July 13, 2009. He appeared in a cameo in the second episode of the first season of [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]]'s dramedy ''[[United States of Tara]]'', as English teacher Oral Gershenoff. He joined the cast of ''[[Numbers (TV series)|Numbers]]'' in 2009, in the recurring role of Professor Russell Lazlo.

In 2012, Hale starred in the drama comedy ''Not That Funny''. He also guest-starred on NBC's long-running show ''[[Law &amp; Order: SVU]]'' as Rick Simms, a teacher who gets fired from his job after being accused of inappropriate behavior with a student.&lt;ref name="HaleSVU"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ross|first=Robyn|title=Exclusive: Martha Stewart, Tony Hale to Guest Star on Law &amp; Order: SVU|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Martha-Stewart-SVU-1045122.aspx|accessdate=March 21, 2012|newspaper=TV Guide|date=March 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Hale was cast in the HBO comedy ''Veep'' as Gary Walsh, the personal assistant to [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]]-turned-President [[Selina Meyer]] (portrayed by [[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hbo.com/veep/index.html#/veep/cast-and-crew/index.html |title=The Official Website for the HBO Series Veep |publisher=Hbo.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 22, 2013, Hale won a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series]] for his work in the show's second season. This was his first major award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/18/emmy-nominees-full-list_n_3616535.html |title=Emmy Nominees Full List: 'Breaking Bad,' 'Homeland,' 'Downton Abbey' Dominate 2013 Awards |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date=2013-07-18 |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He earned his second nomination in 2014, but lost the award to [[Ty Burrell]]. However, Hale won his second [[Primetime Emmy Award]] with his third nomination in 2015, in the same ceremony where ''Veep'' won its first [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series]].

In 2017, Hale hosted the [[9th_Shorty_Awards|9th Annual]] [[Shorty Awards]] at the PlayStation Theater in New York City. In the same year, Hale was cast in the recurring role of Jerome Squalor on the second season of the [[Netflix]] comedy drama series ''[[A Series of Unfortunate Events (TV series)|A Series of Unfortunate Events]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2017/06/series-of-unfortunate-events-nathan-fillion-tony-hale-sara-rue-lucy-punch-roger-bart-season-2-cast-1202110544/|title=‘Series Of Unfortunate Events’: Nathan Fillion, Tony Hale, Sara Rue, Lucy Punch &amp; Roger Bart Join Season 2 Cast|last=Petski|first=Denise|date=June 9, 2017|work=Deadline|accessdate=April 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
