'''Jeffrey Marshall Foxworthy''' (born September 6, 1958) is an American stand-up comedian, actor, television personality, radio personality and author. He is a member of the [[Blue Collar Comedy Tour]], a comedy troupe which also comprises [[Larry the Cable Guy]], [[Bill Engvall]], and [[Ron White]]. Known for his "You might be a [[redneck]]" one-liners, Foxworthy has released six major-label comedy albums. His first two albums were each certified 3× [[Platinum album|Platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]]. Foxworthy has written several books based on his redneck jokes, as well as an autobiography entitled ''No Shirt, No Shoes... No Problem!''&lt;ref name="GenePress"&gt;''From Essex England to the Sunny Southern USA: A Harris Family Journey'', Robert E. Harris, Genealogical Press, 1994, page 870.&lt;/ref&gt;

Foxworthy has also made several ventures into television, starting in the mid-1990s with his own sitcom called ''[[The Jeff Foxworthy Show]]''. He has also appeared alongside Engvall and Larry the Cable Guy in several Blue Collar television specials, most notably ''[[Blue Collar TV]]''. Since 2007, he has been the host of the [[quiz show]] ''[[Are You Smarter than a 5th Grader? (U.S. game show)|Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?]]'' on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] (2007–09 and 2015) and in [[Are You Smarter than a 5th Grader? (U.S. syndicated game show)|syndication]] (2009–11). Foxworthy hosted a nationally syndicated radio show called ''The Foxworthy Countdown'' from April 1999 to December 2009. For three seasons, he hosted [[Game Show Network|GSN]]'s ''[[The American Bible Challenge]]''.

==Early life==
Foxworthy was born in [[Atlanta, Georgia]] on September 6, 1958, the first child of Carole Linda (''née'' Camp) and [[IBM]] executive Jimmy Abstance Foxworthy. His parents were both of [[English people|English]] descent,&lt;ref name="GenePress"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/89/Jeff-Foxworthy.html |title=Jeff Foxworthy Biography (1958-) |publisher=Filmreference.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.surnamedb.com/Surname/Foxworthy Surnamedb.com]&lt;/ref&gt; with his roots lying in the county of [[Essex]].&lt;ref name="GenePress"/&gt; His grandfather, James Marvin Camp, was a [[Hapeville, Georgia|Hapeville]] firefighter for over three decades.&lt;ref name=GenePress/&gt;

According to Foxworthy, who grew up in the [[Southern Baptist]] tradition, he remembers accepting Jesus Christ when he was seven years old. When he told his mother that he wanted to go down to the local sanctuary to accept Christ as his Lord and Savior, his mother, who felt he was too young, told him to wait until he had a firmer understanding of the undertaking. Foxworthy argued with her until a preacher came to their home and vouched for Foxworthy, who went back to the church that night with his mother. Despite this, Foxworthy says that complying with the often-strict rules of the church were difficult for him, saying, "I love God, but I can't act and dress like that."&lt;ref name=TheBlaze&gt;Hallowell, Billy (October 17, 2012). [http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2012/10/17/jeff-foxworthy-tells-theblaze-his-views-on-god-the-bible-how-he-became-a-believer/ "Jeff Foxworthy Tells TheBlaze His Views on God, the Bible &amp; How He Became a Believer"]. [[TheBlaze]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Foxworthy graduated from [[Hapeville High School]]. He attended [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]] in Atlanta, but left just before graduating.&lt;ref name="Redneck Repartee"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gtalumni.org/Publications/techtopics/fall92/redneck.html |title=Redneck Repartee |publisher=Gtalumni.org |date= |accessdate=2010-10-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060519041052/http://gtalumni.org/Publications/techtopics/fall92/redneck.html |archivedate=2006-05-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He worked for five years in [[mainframe computer]] maintenance at IBM, where his father also worked. At the urging of IBM co-workers, Foxworthy entered and won the Great Southeastern Laugh-off at Atlanta's Punchline comedy club in 1984.

==Career==

===Comedy albums===
In 1993, he released ''[[You Might Be a Redneck If…]]'', which started the "You Might Be a [[Redneck (stereotype)|Redneck]]" [[fad]], topped the comedy album charts and sold more than three million copies.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Foxworthy's July 1995 release ''[[Games Rednecks Play]]'' received a 1996 Grammy nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album#1990s|Best Spoken Comedy Album]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/Music/9601/grammy_noms/grammy_list.html |title=List of Grammy nominees - Jan. 4, 1996 |publisher=CNN |date=1996-01-04 |accessdate=2010-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Totally Committed]]'' was released in May 1998. In conjunction with the CD was a one-hour [[HBO]] stand-up special by the same name. The CD reached "gold" status and received a 1999 Grammy Award nomination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utopiaartists.com/bio_jeff_foxworthy.htm |title=Jeff Foxworthy Bio |publisher=Utopia Artists |date=2000-06-12 |accessdate=2010-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video of the song, ''Totally Committed'' featured frequent references to then-[[Atlanta Braves]] [[pitcher]], [[Greg Maddux]] as well as an appearance at the very end by Maddux himself (along with teammate [[John Smoltz]]).

In 2001, Foxworthy received a nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album#2000s|Best Spoken Comedy Album]] at the 43rd Annual Grammys.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20131012051746/http://directory.distributeyourarticles.com/5d91f0f5fb6e/jeff_foxworthy_tickets_foxworthy_received_the_award_for_best_stand_up_comic_at_the_comedy_award Directory.distributeyourarticles.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television===
In 1995, Foxworthy starred in ''[[The Jeff Foxworthy Show]]'', a sitcom created out of his stand-up comedy persona. It aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], but was canceled after one season. [[NBC]] subsequently picked up the show, but it was again canceled after one season. Later, he remarked that the network did not understand how to properly market his humor; thinking his routine was "too Southern" for a national network ("Has anyone heard me talk?", he commented in one of his stand-up routines), they based the first season of his sitcom in [[Bloomington, Indiana]]. Later, the series aired on [[Nick at Nite]] and [[Country Music Television|CMT]] in 2005 and 2006. He also appeared in [[Alan Jackson]]'s video for "[[I Don't Even Know Your Name]]" in 1995.

Foxworthy hosted Country Weekly's ""[[The Nashville Network|TNN]] Music City News Country Awards" show for 1998, 1999, and 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_action=doc&amp;p_docid=110CAD8D8320A8C0&amp;p_docnum=1 Nl.newsbank.com]{{dead link|date=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He hosted ''[[Are You Smarter than a 5th Grader? (U.S. game show)|Are You Smarter than A 5th Grader?]]'' on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in [[prime time]]. He hosted the syndicated version of the series from September 21, 2009 until its cancellation on March 24, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pursell |first=Chris |url=http://www.tvweek.com/news/2008/09/foxworthy_signs_on_for_syndie.php |title=Foxworthy Signs on for Syndie '5th Grader' | work = In Depth |publisher=TVWeek |date= |accessdate=2010-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was announced that Foxworthy would return as host of ''Are You Smarter than a 5th Grader?''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fox.com/article/are-you-smarter-than-a-5th-grader Fox.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150209010418/http://www.fox.com/article/are-you-smarter-than-a-5th-grader |date=2015-02-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he is a host on ''The Bucks of Tecomate'' which airs on the [[NBC Sports Network]] with Alabama native David Morris.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

===Blue collar comedy===
[[File:Jeff Foxworthy at Resch Center.jpg|thumb|Foxworthy in performance at the Resch Center in Green Bay in 2015]]
In the early 2000s, Foxworthy had a career resurgence as a result of the [[Blue Collar Comedy Tour]], in which he and three other comedians ([[Larry the Cable Guy]], [[Ron White]], and [[Bill Engvall]]), specializing in common-man comedy, toured the country, and performed for record crowds. The tour lasted three full years, constantly being extended after an initial run of 20 shows.

In 2004, he launched a new television series called ''[[Blue Collar TV]]'' on [[The WB Television Network]], [[Comedy Central]], and Comedy Network (2007). He served as [[executive producer]], and starred alongside Blue Collar Comedy Tour-mates Larry the Cable Guy and Bill Engvall. (Ron White made occasional guest appearances.) On Larry the Cable Guy's website, he posted that the show was canceled on October 17, 2005 by WB. Reruns of ''Blue Collar TV'' continued until the network merged with [[UPN]] to form [[The CW]]. In 2006 Foxworthy resurrected the ''Blue Collar TV'' format on [[Country Music Television]] (CMT) with ''Foxworthy's Big Night Out''. The show began airing in the summer and was canceled after one season.

===Books===
Foxworthy has authored several books, including ''You Might Be a Redneck If...'' (1989), as well as his autobiography, ''No Shirt, No Shoes, No Problem!'' (1996). Artist [[Layron DeJarnette]] provided illustrations for the Redneck Dictionary books. R. David Boyd has been the exclusive illustrator for most of Foxworthy's books and album covers.

He also has released a [[cookbook]] entitled ''The Redneck Grill'', co-authored with [[Newnan, Georgia]] artist R. David Boyd, and "''Redneck Extreme Mobile Home Makeover''" (2005), a book with some of his redneck jokes.

The program's last broadcast, the 2009 year-end countdown, aired the weekend of December 27, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bmi.com/news/entry/233011 |title=News &amp;#124; Sara Evans Soars to New Heights with 2001 CMA Nominations |publisher=BMI.com |date=2001-08-28 |accessdate=2010-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blue Collar Comedy Radio airs on [[Sirius Satellite Radio]] channel 97 and is associated with Raw Dog Comedy on Sirius 99.

===Foxworthy Outdoors===
In August 2011, Foxworthy launched Foxworthy Outdoors, a website carrying an assortment of Foxworthy-brand hunting and outdoors products. On the site, he also hosts a [[web series]] called ''Jeff Foxworthy: Inside &amp; Out'', featuring some of his friends as they document hunting trips, fishing outings, and land conservation on his [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] farm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxworthyoutdoors.com/videos/category/inside-out Foxworthyoutdoors.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Watch the best outdoor shows for free on CarbonTV|url = http://www.carbontv.com/shows/foxworthy-outdoors-inside-and-out/|website = CarbonTV|access-date = 2016-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foxworthy met his wife Pamela Gregg at the Punchline in Atlanta, Georgia and they married on September 18, 1985.

===Religious leaning===
Foxworthy emphasizes the Bible as a guide for his everyday life, including what to do with his income, which he explains is not his, but "belongs to God".{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} In a 2012 interview, Foxworthy revealed that "rather than going and sitting in a service for an hour every Sunday and that being extent of my faith, it's more important that I live it out. I lead a Bible study with homeless guys on Tuesday mornings ... I have done it for years."&lt;ref name=TheBlaze/&gt; The group started with 15 participants, and subsequently grew to over 100 homeless men. According to Foxworthy, if addicts among the group successfully complete treatment, the organization will house them for a year, and offer counseling and support in reuniting them with their estranged families.&lt;ref name=TheBlaze/&gt;

===Political positions===
In 2012, Foxworthy endorsed Republican presidential candidate [[Mitt Romney]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bingham, Amy|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/OTUS/jeff-foxworthy-throws-redneck-cred-mitt-romney/story?id=15901753|title=Celebrity Endorsements: Jeff Foxworthy Backs Mitt Romney|publisher=ABC News|date=March 12, 2012|accessdate=October 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
