He has appeared in a number of shows for the BBC with [[Steve Coogan]], including ''[[The Trip (2010 TV series)|The Trip]]'' series in 2010, released as a feature film later that year; and ''[[The Trip to Italy]]'' in 2014 and ''[[The Trip to Spain]]'' in 2017, also edited and released as feature films.

Since 2009, Brydon has presented the [[BBC One]] comedy panel show ''[[Would I Lie to You? (TV series)|Would I Lie to You?]]'' He played himself in ''[[Rob Brydon's Annually Retentive]]'', a satirical series about a fictional panel show, which ran on [[BBC Three]] from 2006 until 2007. Between 2010 and 2012, Brydon presented his own [[BBC Two]] late-night chat show called ''[[The Rob Brydon Show]].'' Since April 2014, Brydon has hosted the Saturday-night game show ''[[The Guess List]]'' for [[BBC One]].

==Early life==
Jones was born on 3 May 1965 in [[Baglan, Neath Port Talbot|Baglan]], [[Glamorgan]], Wales.&lt;ref name="bbc bio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/arts/sites/rob-brydon/ |title=Rob Brydon |accessdate=3 December 2010 |year=2010 |publisher=[[BBC Cymru Wales]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc Lawson"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b015mt6b |title=Mark Lawson talks to ... Rob Brydon |accessdate=11 May 2013 |date=6 October 2011 |publisher=[[BBC Four]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother, Joy Jones (née Brydon), was a school teacher, and his father, Howard Jones, was a [[car dealer]]. He grew up in Baglan, with his younger brother Peter (born 1973).&lt;ref name="askrob"/&gt;

Brydon was educated at two [[independent school (United Kingdom)|independent school]]s: St. John's School in [[Porthcawl]], which [[Eddie Izzard]] also attended, and [[Dumbarton House School]] in Swansea until the age of 14. This was followed by [[Porthcawl Comprehensive School]], where he met [[Ruth Jones]] (with whom he later worked in ''[[Gavin &amp; Stacey]]'') and became a member of the school's youth theatre group. While at Dumbarton, he once stole the lunch money of fellow pupil [[Catherine Zeta-Jones]] (which he admitted while participating in a series 4 episode of ''Would I Lie To You?'').&lt;ref name="lie"/&gt;

Brydon has said that his primary childhood influences in comedy were [[Barry Humphries]], [[Frankie Howerd]] and [[Woody Allen]]. He has also said that he used to memorise entire sketches by [[Peter Cook]], [[Dudley Moore]] and [[Peter Sellers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Quark|title=Quark interviews Rob Brydon|url=http://quarkonline.wordpress.com/2014/04/28/quark-interviews-rob-brydon/|publisher=Quark|accessdate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="quark"/&gt;

==Career==
Brydon attended the [[Royal Welsh College of Music &amp; Drama]], [[Cardiff]]. He left after a year, to join [[BBC Radio Wales|Radio Wales]] at the age of 20.&lt;ref name="bbc Lawson"/&gt; His early broadcasts included work as a [[disc jockey]] on [[BBC Radio Wales]], when his Saturday morning shows included contributions from stand-up comedian Pete Park-Walker. Between 1992 and 1994, on Radio Wales (where he stayed for six years) he was the main presenter of ''Rave'', one of [[BBC Radio 5 (former)|BBC Radio 5]]'s youth magazine and music programmes, with [[Alan Thompson (Welsh radio broadcaster)|Alan Thompson]]. He developed his ''[[Marion and Geoff]]'' story from this.&lt;ref name="bbc2011-08-19"/&gt;

In 1994 and 1995 Brydon appeared in numerous episodes of the original Radio Wales version of the cult comedy ''[[Satellite City (sitcom)|Satellite City]]'' with [[Boyd Clack]]. Although he has stayed with radio as a comedy performer on [[BBC Radio Five Live]]'s ''The Treatment'', Brydon also does occasional stints as a stand-in presenter on [[BBC Radio 2]]. He has stood in for [[Ken Bruce]], one of the people whom he impersonates. On 1 April 2011 he appeared in Bruce's place on his show as an [[April Fools' Day]] joke.&lt;ref name="BBCbruce"/&gt;&lt;ref name="indybruce"/&gt;

Between September and October 2011, Brydon starred alongside Sir [[Kenneth Branagh]] in [[Francis Veber]]'s play ''The Painkiller'' at the [[Lyric Theatre, Belfast|Lyric Theatre]] in Belfast. He reprised his role with Branagh, in March and April 2016, at the [[Garrick Theatre]] in London's West End.&lt;ref name="branagh"/&gt; Whilst not calling himself an impressionist Brydon can do impressions of: [[Alec Guinness|Sir Alec Guinness]], [[James Dean]], [[Michael J. Fox]], Richard Burton, [[Tom Jones (singer)|Sir Tom Jones]], Sir Michael Caine, Mick Jagger and Ronnie Corbett.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

===Voice-over artist===
Brydon was first known nationally as a voice artist. He provided several voices for the ''[[Discworld]]'' computer games and continuity announcements for [[BBC 1]].&lt;ref name="sol"/&gt; He is also known for voice-over work in television advertising, including for [[Renault]], [[Tango (drink)|Tango]], ''[[The Times]]'', [[Tesco]], [[Abbey (bank)|Abbey National]], [[Sainsbury's]], [[McDonald's]], [[Pot Noodle]], [[Domino's Pizza]], [[Crunchy Nut Cornflakes]], ''[[The Observer]]'' and [[Fairy Liquid]]. He voiced the main character, Lewton, in the ''Discworld'' computer game ''[[Discworld Noir]]'',&lt;ref name="moby"/&gt; and provided voices in animated films such as ''[[The Gruffalo (film)|The Gruffalo]]'', ''[[The Gruffalo's Child (film)|The Gruffalo's Child]]'' and ''[[Room on the Broom (film)|Room on the Broom]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0117339/|title=Rob Brydon|website=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writing breakthrough===
For a brief period in the early 1990s Brydon was a presenter for the [[Home Shopping Network]].&lt;ref name="imdb"/&gt; He began to find small roles in several successful films and television series. In 2000 he made his mark in television comedy, with two series which he co-wrote and performed for the BBC: ''[[Human Remains (TV series)|Human Remains]],'' co-written by [[Julia Davis]]; and the commercially successful ''[[Marion and Geoff]].''

Since these series Brydon has developed a career path as a character actor, in both comedic and serious roles. He portrayed controversial theatre critic [[Kenneth Tynan]] in the BBC Four film ''Kenneth Tynan: In Praise of Hardcore'' (2005), opposite [[Julian Sands]] as [[Laurence Olivier]].

His character [[List of Gavin &amp; Stacey characters#Bryn West|Bryn West]] in ''[[Gavin &amp; Stacey]]'', written by [[Ruth Jones]] and [[James Corden]], allowed him to return to his South Wales roots. In this role Brydon performed the 2009 [[Comic Relief]] charity single, "[[(Barry) Islands in the Stream]]", with [[Ruth Jones]] (both actors appearing as their characters from ''Gavin &amp; Stacey'') and singer [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]]. It reached No.1 in the [[UK singles chart]] on 15 March 2009.

In 2010 Brydon starred alongside [[Steve Coogan]] in [[Michael Winterbottom]]'s partially improvised BBC Two sitcom series ''[[The Trip (2010 TV series)|The Trip]],'' in which both actors played fictionalized versions of their public personas (Brydon, optimistic and always eager to do an impression; and Coogan, [[Misanthropy|misanthropic]] and bitter that he's not the major international star he believes he should be).&lt;ref name="wollaston"/&gt;

Brydon's book ''Small Man in a Book'' (the title a play on his "small-man-in-a-box" impression) was published in November 2011.&lt;ref name="gordon"/&gt;

===Panellist/chairman===
In 2006 Brydon first appeared on the BBC Radio 4 comedy panel game ''[[I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue]]''. His singing voice earned the unprecedented accolade from the erstwhile host, [[Humphrey Lyttelton]], of being "not bad". When the team went on a tour of non-broadcast stage shows, Brydon filled in as chairman when Lyttelton was in hospital to repair an aortic aneurysm. Lyttelton died in hospital after surgery.

In February 2009, it was announced that Brydon would be one of three people to replace Lyttelton as chairman of the 51st series of ''I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue'' (the others being [[Stephen Fry]] and [[Jack Dee]]).&lt;ref name="spy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="clue"/&gt; Brydon also appeared as guest panellist in the first two episodes of series 52, chaired by Jack Dee. He returned as a guest panellist in the last two episodes of series 54 in January 2011.

Additionally, he took over in 2009 from [[Angus Deayton]] as host of ''[[Would I Lie To You? (TV series)|Would I Lie To You?]]''.&lt;ref name="parker"/&gt; Brydon has presented an episode of ''[[Have I Got News for You]]''&lt;ref name="smith"/&gt; and has appeared on BBC Radio 4's panel game ''[[Just a Minute]]''.&lt;ref name="jam"/&gt;
&lt;ref name="laugh"/&gt;

Brydon narrated a two-part programme on BBC Radio 4, ''The Pain of Laughter: The Last Days of Kenneth Williams''. It explored the latter part of [[Kenneth Williams|Williams]]'s life, featuring many of the performer's friends and contemporaries.
In other radio work Brydon sat in for [[Ken Bruce]] on BBC Radio 2 for one day only on 25 August 2008. In addition to this, on 1 April 2011, Brydon impersonated Bruce for the entire two-hour and thirty minutes show. Bruce came on the air at the end of the show to reveal the [[prank]].

Brydon has appeared on the TV comedy quiz ''[[QI]]''. In his first appearance (Series A, episode 5), his talent for mimicry was displayed with impressions of [[Alec Guinness|Sir Alec Guinness]], [[James Dean]], and [[Michael J. Fox]]. In the 2008 [[List of QI episodes (F series)#Episode 2 "Fire &amp; Freezing" (Christmas special)|Christmas special]], he provided impressions of [[Richard Burton]] and [[Tom Jones (singer)|Sir Tom Jones]].

===Stand-up===
In 2009/10 Brydon had his first stand-up tour in the UK as Rob Brydon (rather than as a differently named character). The resulting DVD of the 2009/10 show, ''Rob Brydon: Live'', was released on 23 November 2009.&lt;ref name="AutoDJ-1"/&gt; Brydon appeared as a host on episode two of series five of the BBC series of ''[[Live at the Apollo (TV series)|Live at the Apollo]]''.

In 2010 Brydon took part in ''[[Channel 4's Comedy Gala]]'', a [[Benefit concert|benefit show]] in aid of [[Great Ormond Street Hospital|Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital]], filmed live at the [[The O2 Arena (London)|O2 Arena]] in London on 30 March. He was one of six [[Master of Ceremonies|compères]] for [[Elizabeth II|the Queen]]'s [[Diamond Jubilee Concert]] held outside [[Buckingham Palace]] on 4 June 2012.

==Personal life==
From his first marriage Brydon has two daughters, Katie, born August 1994 and Amy, born July 1998, and a son Harry, born October 1996.&lt;!-- to who? --&gt;&lt;ref name="swann"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ancestry"/&gt;

After being divorced, on 6 October 2006 Brydon married Claire Holland,&lt;ref name="mail"/&gt; a former producer on ''[[The South Bank Show]]'', at [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]] church. They live in [[Strawberry Hill, London|Strawberry Hill]] in the [[London Borough of Richmond upon Thames]]. They have two sons, Tom, born in April 2008, and George, born in June 2011.&lt;ref name="weekend"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/my-perfect-weekend/7043548/My-perfect-weekend-Rob-Brydon.html |location=London |work=The Daily Telegraph |first=Yvonne |last=Swann |title=My perfect weekend: Rob Brydon |date=22 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A keen golfer, Brydon is also a [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] fan and is an ambassador to their 1912 foundation.&lt;ref name="swans"/&gt;

Brydon and [[Ben Miller]] have both regularly been mistaken for each other by members of the public.&lt;ref name="miller"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/article75048.ece|location=London|work=The Sun|first=Derek|last=Robins|title=Double trouble for Ben|date=17 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a reference to that mix-up, they dressed in similar outfits and shared a narcissistic kiss in the ''[[QI]]'' episode "[[QI (F series)#Episode 9 "The Future"|The Future]]", first broadcast on 20 February 2009.&lt;ref name="qi"&gt;{{Cite episode |title=The Future |episode-link= |url= |access-date= |series=[[QI]] |network= |station=[[BBC One]] |date=20 February 2009 |series-no=F |number=9 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honours and awards==
Brydon was made an honorary fellow of the [[Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama]] where he previously studied.&lt;ref name="rwcmd"/&gt;{{when|date=June 2012}} Brydon was appointed [[Member of the Order of the British Empire]] (MBE) in the [[2013 Birthday Honours]] for services to comedy and broadcasting and for charitable services.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=60534 |supp=y|page=15|date=15 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-22904807 | work=BBC News | title=Birthday Honours: Adele joins Blackadder stars on list | date=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political views==
In August 2014, Brydon was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to ''[[The Guardian]]'' opposing [[Scottish independence]] in the run-up to September's [[Scottish independence referendum, 2014|referendum on that issue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/aug/07/celebrities-open-letter-scotland-independence-full-text |title=Celebrities' open letter to Scotland – full text and list of signatories |work=The Guardian |date=7 August 2014 |accessdate=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
