He hosted [[late night television]] talk shows for 33 years, beginning with the February 1, 1982, debut of ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'' on [[NBC]], and ending with the May 20, 2015, broadcast of ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' on [[CBS]]. In total, Letterman hosted 6,028 episodes of ''Late Night'' and ''Late Show'',&lt;ref name=YahooNews&gt;{{cite news|title=David Letterman signs off after 33 years and 6,028 shows |url=https://news.yahoo.com/photos/david-letterman-signs-off-after-33-years-and-6-028-shows-1432171593-slideshow/|accessdate=May 20, 2015|publisher=[[Yahoo!]]|agency=Associated Press |date=May 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; surpassing friend and mentor [[Johnny Carson]] as the longest-serving late night talk show host in American television history.&lt;ref name=HollywoodReporter&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/cbs-extends-david-letterman-contract-643439 |title=CBS Extends David Letterman Contract Through 2015 |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=October 4, 2013 |accessdate=November 23, 2013 |first=Lacey |last=Rose}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996 Letterman was ranked 45th on ''[[TV Guide]]''{{'}}s 50 Greatest TV Stars of All Time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |year=1996 |title=Special Collectors' Issue: 50 Greatest TV Stars of All Time |magazine=[[TV Guide]] |issue=December 14–20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TVGuide&gt;Miller, Gregory E.; Schneider, Michael (December 31, 2015).

Letterman currently hosts the [[Netflix]] series ''[[My Next Guest Needs No Introduction with David Letterman]]''. 

Letterman is also a television and film producer. His company, [[Worldwide Pants]], produced his shows as well as ''[[The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson]]'' and several prime-time comedies, the most successful of which was ''[[Everybody Loves Raymond]]'', now in [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]].

Several late-night hosts have cited Letterman's influence, including [[Conan O'Brien]] (his successor on ''[[Late Night (NBC)|Late Night]]''), [[Stephen Colbert]] (his successor on ''[[Late Show (CBS TV series)|The Late Show]]''), [[Jimmy Fallon]], [[Jimmy Kimmel]], and [[Seth Meyers]].

== Early life and career ==
Letterman was born in [[Indianapolis]], Indiana. His father, Harry Joseph Letterman (April 15, 1915 – February 13, 1973),&lt;ref&gt;Record of Harry Letterman, [[Social Security Death Index]]&lt;/ref&gt; was a florist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://playboysfw.kinja.com/david-lettermans-1984-playboy-interview-a-candid-conv-1557838143|title=David Letterman's 1984 Playboy Interview. A Candid Conversation with the Comedy Genius In His Youth|author=Sam Merrill|work=Playboy}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother, [[Dorothy Mengering|Dorothy Marie Letterman Mengering]] (née Hofert; July 18, 1921 – April 11, 2017),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/obit-dorothy-mengering-dead-795160|title=Dorothy Mengering, David Letterman's Mom and ''Late Show'' Personality, Dies at 95|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate=April 11, 2017|date=April 11, 2017|author=Mike Barnes}}&lt;/ref&gt; a church secretary for the Second Presbyterian Church of Indianapolis, was an occasional figure on Letterman's show, usually at holidays and birthdays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://carmel-indiana.funcityfinder.com/2010/03/14/dorothy-mengering-daves-mom/|title=Dorothy Mengering, Dave's Mom – FunCityFinder|work=Carmel Indiana}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He lived on the north side of Indianapolis ([[Broad Ripple]] area), about 12 miles from the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]] and he enjoyed collecting model cars, including racers.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Graves. "Letterman Gets Moment in Hot Seat." ''[[USA Today]]'', May 23, 2005, p. 1C.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, he told an interviewer for ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' that, while growing up, he admired his father's ability to tell jokes and be the life of the party. Harry Joseph Letterman survived a heart attack at age 36, when David was a young boy. The fear of losing his father was constantly with Letterman as he grew up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esquire.com/features/daveheart-letterman-0500 |title=Dave Letterman Profile&amp;nbsp;— Interview with David Letterman |publisher=Esquire |date=October 2, 2009 |accessdate=November 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The elder Letterman died of a second heart attack&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2000-01-14/news/18138686_1_angioplasty-family-history-high-cholesterol|title=Cholesterol high, has family history|author1=Mitchell Fink|author2=Eric Mink|author3=Leo Standora|author4=Richard Huff|author5=Bill Hutchinson|work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|location=New York City|date=January 14, 2000|accessdate=November 6, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120730104857/http://articles.nydailynews.com/2000-01-14/news/18138686_1_angioplasty-family-history-high-cholesterol|archivedate=July 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; at age 57.

[[File:DavidLettermanAtBSU.JPG|alt=|thumb|Letterman's association with Ball State University was recognized by a renaming ceremony for their David Letterman Communication and Media Building in 2006.]]
Letterman attended his hometown's [[Broad Ripple High School]] and worked as a stock boy at the local Atlas Supermarket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://lostindiana.net/2004/11/30/atlas-supermarket-broad-ripple/ |title= Atlas Supermarket |publisher=Lost Indiana |accessdate=April 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''Ball State Daily News'', he originally had wanted to attend [[Indiana University]], but his [[Academic grading in the United States|grades]] were not good enough, so he instead attended [[Ball State University]], in [[Muncie, Indiana]].&lt;ref&gt;Gail Koch. "After Two Decades, Letterman Wit Shows No Signs of Stopping." ''Ball State Daily News'', February 23, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; He is a member of the [[Sigma Chi]] fraternity, and he graduated in 1969 from what was then the Department of Radio and Television. A self-described average student, Letterman later endowed a scholarship for what he called "C students" at Ball State.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finaid.org/scholarships/average.phtml |title=Scholarships &amp;#124; Scholarships for Average Students |publisher=FinAid |date=January 22, 1999 |accessdate=November 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though he registered for the draft and passed his physical after graduating from college, he was not drafted for service in [[Vietnam war|Vietnam]] because of receiving a [[draft lottery (1969)|draft lottery]] number of 346 (out of 366).&lt;ref&gt;Revealed on air during January 7, 2011, ''Late Show with David Letterman'' during an interview with Regis Philbin.&lt;/ref&gt;

Letterman began his broadcasting career as an announcer and newscaster at the college's student-run radio station—[[WBST]]—a 10-watt campus station which now is part of [[Indiana Public Radio]].&lt;ref name="BSU-PR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indianapublicradio.org/about/stationhistory/|title=Indiana Public Radio – Station History|work=indianapublicradio.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was fired for treating classical music with irreverence.&lt;ref name="BSU-PR" /&gt; He then became involved with the founding of another campus station—WAGO-AM 570 (now [[WWHI]], 91.3).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reelradio.com/tc/index.html#dlwago69|title=David Letterman, WAGO Muncie Indiana|date=April 1, 1969|publisher=reelradio.com|quote=Dave Letterman is heard in this segment edited from the 11PM–12 midnight hour on April 1, 1969.

He credits [[Paul Dixon (entertainer)|Paul Dixon]], host of the ''[[Paul Dixon Show]]'', a Cincinnati-based talk show also shown in Indianapolis while he was growing up, for inspiring his choice of career:&lt;ref name="dixon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enquirer.com/editions/1997/02/24/loc_letterman.html|title=Local show inspired young Letterman|author=Kiesewetter, John |publisher=[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]]| date=February 24, 1997| accessdate=May 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;I was just out of college [in 1969], and I really didn't know what I wanted to do. And then all of a sudden I saw him doing it [on TV]. And I thought: That's really what I want to do!&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Weatherman ===
Letterman began his career as a radio talk show host on [[WNTS|WNTS (AM)]] and on Indianapolis television station WLWI (which changed its call sign to [[WTHR]] in 1976) as an anchor and [[Meteorologist|weatherman]]. He received some attention for his unpredictable on-air behavior, which included congratulating a [[tropical storm]] for being upgraded to a [[Tropical cyclone|hurricane]] and predicting [[hail]] stones "the size of canned hams."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.playboy.com/articles/david-letterman-interview/index.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090415130808/http://www.playboy.com/articles/david-letterman-interview/index.html|title=Playboy Interview – David Letterman – Late Show Host|archivedate=April 15, 2009|work=playboy.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He would also occasionally report the weather and the day's very high and low temps for fictitious cities ("Eight inches of snow in Bingree and surrounding areas") while on another occasion saying that a state border had been erased when a satellite map accidentally omitted the state border between Indiana and Ohio, attributing it to dirty political dealings. ("The higher-ups have removed the border between Indiana and Ohio making it one giant state. Personally, I'm against it. I don't know what to do about it.")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Samenow|first1=Jason|title=David Letterman's early career as a weatherman |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/capital-weather-gang/wp/2015/05/20/video-david-lettermans-early-career-as-a-weatherman/|work=The Washington Post|date=May 20, 2015 |accessdate=June 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also starred in a local kiddie show, made wisecracks as host of a late night TV show called "Freeze-Dried Movies" (he once acted out a scene from ''[[Godzilla (1954 film)|Godzilla]]'' using plastic dinosaurs), and hosted a talk show that aired early on Saturday mornings called ''Clover Power'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Bzbq8X8qZE#t32s |title=Letterman morning show clips and &amp; Jon Stewart cancellation -Jun1995 |publisher=YouTube |date=January 22, 2010 |accessdate=November 6, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130203052315/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Bzbq8X8qZE |archivedate=February 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he interviewed [[4-H]] members about their projects.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20010620022309/http://www.indystar.com/library/factfiles/people/l/letterman_david/letterman.html David Letterman] Indianapolis Star. June 1, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971 Letterman appeared as a pit road reporter for [[ABC Sports]]' tape-delayed coverage of the [[1971 Indianapolis 500|Indianapolis 500]] (his first nationally telecast appearance; WLWI was the local ABC affiliate at the time).&lt;ref name="indy"&gt;{{Youtube|8sMnBmHzAg0|Letterman's Network Debut}}&lt;/ref&gt; Letterman was initially introduced as [[Chris Economaki]], although this was corrected at the end of the interview ([[Jim McKay]] announced his name as Dave Letterman). Letterman interviewed [[Mario Andretti]], who had just crashed out of the race.

=== Move to Los Angeles ===
[[File:The Comedy Store.jpg|alt=|thumb|Letterman's comedic career took hold at Los Angeles' [[The Comedy Store|Comedy Store]].]]
In 1975, encouraged by his then-wife Michelle and several of his [[Sigma Chi]] fraternity brothers, Letterman moved to Los Angeles, with hope of becoming a comedy writer.&lt;ref&gt;Gail Koch. "Letterman Evolved from Struggling Radio Host to Star", ''Ball State Daily News'', February 1, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; He and Michelle packed their belongings in his pickup truck and headed west.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Piers Morgan Tonight: Regis Talks to David Letterman|url=http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1206/02/pmt.01.html| accessdate=August 22, 2012|publisher=CNN}} Airdate June 2, 2012, Regis Philbin, guest host.

There were others whose names would never be recognizable to the public because they were not star performers, such as Wayne Kline, Marty Nadler, Jeff Stein, Jack Handey, Steve Oedekirk, and Larry Jacobson, but who would soon write for some of the most popular sitcoms and late-night talk shows in television history.

By the summer of 1977, Letterman was a writer and regular on the six-week summer series ''The [[Starland Vocal Band]] Show'', broadcast on [[CBS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUabP1JDCZA|title=1977 'Afternoon Delight' clip from The Starland Vocal Band show|publisher=YouTube|author=mickstadium|date=July 15, 2011|accessdate=November 6, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130908113731/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUabP1JDCZA|archivedate=September 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He hosted a 1977 pilot for a game show entitled ''The Riddlers''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Riddlers with David Letterman (1977)|url=http://classicshowbiz.blogspot.com/2007/04/riddlers-1977-with-host-david-letterman.html|publisher=classictelevisionshowbiz|date=April 8, 2007|accessdate=November 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bk6zFrTYMk|title=David Letterman on "PASSWORD PLUS+ 1979"|publisher=YouTube|date=June 29, 2010|accessdate=November 6, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130908103557/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bk6zFrTYMk |archivedate=September 8, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (that was never picked up), and co-starred in the [[Barry Levinson]]-produced comedy special ''[[Peeping Times]]'' that aired in January 1978.

His dry, sarcastic humor caught the attention of scouts for ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'', and Letterman was soon a regular guest on the show. Letterman became a favorite of Carson and was a regular guest host for the show beginning in 1978.

=== Morning show ===
{{Main|The David Letterman Show}}
On June 23, 1980, Letterman was given his own morning comedy show on [[NBC]], ''[[The David Letterman Show]]''. It was originally 90 minutes long, but was shortened to 60 minutes in August 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Kerr. "David Letterman's Off-Center Humor Finds a Home." ''The New York Times'', February 19, 1984, p.

NBC kept Letterman under contract (paying him) to be able to try him in a different time slot. ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'' debuted February 1, 1982; the first guest on the first show was [[Bill Murray]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bill Murray @ David Letterman #1, 1982, 1 of 2 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7US7PU6tidM |publisher=YouTube |year=1982 |accessdate=December 8, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422224920/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7US7PU6tidM&amp;gl=US&amp;hl=en |archivedate=April 22, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Murray later went on to become one of Letterman's most recurrent guests, guesting on the show's 30th anniversary episode, which aired January 31, 2012 and on the very last show, which aired May 20, 2015. The show ran Monday through Thursday at 12:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. [[Eastern time zone|Eastern Time]], immediately following ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' (a Friday night broadcast was added in June 1987). It was seen as being edgy and unpredictable, and soon developed a cult following (particularly among college students). Letterman's reputation as an [[wikt:acerbic|acerbic]] interviewer was borne out in verbal sparring matches with [[Cher]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgDHhmSrAo |publisher=YouTube |title=Cher on Late Night (part 1 of 2) |year=1986 |accessdate=December 8, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111111023335/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgDHhmSrAo |archivedate=November 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (who even called him an asshole on the show&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Hunt | first=Stacey Wilson | date=May 14, 2015 | title=Cher Pays Tribute to David Letterman: 'I Called Him an Asshole on the Air' | work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/cher-pays-tribute-david-letterman-795447 | access-date=July 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Shirley MacLaine]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Youtube|uh2UVul29CM|Shirley Maclaine on Late Night (1988) (Part 1 of 2)}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Grodin]], and [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]. The show also featured comedy segments and running characters, in a style heavily influenced by the 1950s and 1960s programs of [[Steve Allen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Steve Allen Remembered|url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/steve-allen-remembered-36211.aspx|author=Michael Ausiello|work=TV Guide|date=November 1, 2000|accessdate=November 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show often featured quirky, genre-mocking regular features, including "Stupid Pet Tricks"&lt;ref&gt;{{Youtube|title=Late-Night with David Letterman Stupid Pet Tricks|id=kTPB14ivKUs}}&lt;/ref&gt; (which had its origins on Letterman's morning show), Stupid Human Tricks,&lt;ref&gt;{{Youtube|title=Stupid Human Trick on David Letterman 1–1987|id=Oa4Vfn-pjHI}}&lt;/ref&gt; dropping various objects off the roof of a five-story building,&lt;ref&gt;{{Youtube|title=Letterman 4th Anniversary Special, Pt. 7|id=bFyRBOx_auM}}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrations of unorthodox clothing (such as suits made of [[Alka-Seltzer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Youtube|EAu0USchCrI|David Letterman "Alka Seltzer" suit}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Velcro]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Youtube|title=Letterman in a Suit of Velcro|id=N9uxxqKGmYg}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[suet]]), a recurring [[Top 10 list (David Letterman)|Top 10 list]], the Monkey-Cam&lt;ref&gt;{{Youtube|title=Letterman – Monkey Cam|id=RLmiVi9HXK4}}&lt;/ref&gt; (and the Audience Cam), a facetious letter-answering segment,&lt;ref&gt;{{Youtube|DzIea4w1F6E|David Letterman answers viewer mail in person}}&lt;/ref&gt; several "Film[s] by My Dog Bob" in which a camera was mounted on Letterman's own dog&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrIiLrNq0oI|title=A film by Bob the dog (from David Letterman)|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=November 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; (often with comic results) and Small Town News,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUs5hNVZuCs|title=Classic Dave = small town news, 1/12/88|publisher=YouTube|date=January 12, 1988|accessdate=November 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; all of which would eventually move with Letterman to CBS.

Other memorable moments included Letterman using a bullhorn to interrupt a live interview on ''[[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]]'', announcing that he was the NBC News president and that he was not wearing any pants;&lt;ref name="todayshow"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Hall|first=Jane|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20094089,00.html |title=Late Night Letterman|magazine=People|date=July 14, 1986|volume=26|issue=2|pages=88– |accessdate=January 28, 2013|quote=Bryant Gumbel was not amused when Letterman interrupted an outdoor Today show special in Rockefeller Center, shouting from his own taping session above, "I am Larry Grossman, President of NBC News...and I'm not wearing pants!"

In one infamous appearance, in 1982, [[Andy Kaufman]] (who was already wearing a neck brace) appeared with professional wrestler [[Jerry Lawler]], who slapped and knocked the comedian to the ground (though Lawler and Kaufman's friend [[Bob Zmuda]] later revealed that the event was [[work (professional wrestling)|staged]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dailyhaggis.com/2002/12/27/kaufman-fight-was-a-fake/|title=Kaufman Fight Was a Fake| publisher=dailyhaggis.com|date=March 6, 2010 |accessdate=November 6, 2011}}  This scene was re-created in the film "Man in the Moon" starring Jim Carrey&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Late Show with David Letterman'' ===
{{Main|Late Show with David Letterman}}
[[File:The Late Show.jpg|thumb|The [[Ed Sullivan Theater]], where ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' was recorded]]

In 1992, [[Johnny Carson]] retired, and many fans believed that Letterman would become host of ''The Tonight Show''. When NBC instead gave the job to [[Jay Leno]], Letterman departed NBC to host his own late-night show on [[CBS]], opposite ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' at 11:30&amp;nbsp;p.m., called the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]''. The new show debuted on August 30, 1993, and was taped at the historic [[Ed Sullivan Theater]], where [[Ed Sullivan]] broadcast his [[The Ed Sullivan Show|eponymous variety series]] from 1948 to 1971. For Letterman's arrival, CBS spent {{US$|8}}&amp;nbsp;million in renovations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1995-03-31/features/9503310282_1_cbs-store-letterman-show-times-square|title=Letterman's Neighbor's Discover Spotlight's Chilly Side|publisher=St. Petersburg Times|author=Mark Albright |date=March 31, 1995|accessdate=December 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to that cost, CBS also signed Letterman to a lucrative three-year, {{US$|14}}&amp;nbsp;million/year contract,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,305416,00.html|title=Is Dave Worth It?|work=Entertainment Weekly|author=Mark Harris|date=January 29, 1993|accessdate=December 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; doubling his ''Late Night'' salary. The total cost for everything (renovations, negotiation right paid to NBC, signing Letterman, announcer [[Bill Wendell]], [[Paul Shaffer]], the writers and the band) was over {{US$|140}}&amp;nbsp;million.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

But while the expectation was that Letterman would retain his unique style and sense of humor with the move, ''Late Show'' was not an exact replica of his old NBC program. Recognizing the more formal mood (and wider audience) of his new time slot and studio, Letterman eschewed his trademark [[blazer]] with [[khaki]] pants and white wrestling shoes wardrobe combination in favor of expensive shoes, tailored suits and light-colored socks. The monologue was lengthened. Paul Shaffer and the [[World's Most Dangerous Band]] followed Letterman to CBS, but they added a brass section and were [[rebranded]] the [[CBS Orchestra]] (Shaffer's request); a small band had been mandated by Carson while Letterman occupied the 12:30 slot. Additionally, because of intellectual property disagreements, Letterman was unable to import many of his ''Late Night'' segments verbatim,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oocities.org/davidletterman82/TimeAugust1993Article.html|work=Time|title=Stupid Talk Show Tricks| author=Richard Corliss |date=August 2, 1993|accessdate=December 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he sidestepped this problem by simply renaming them (the "Top Ten List" became the "Late Show Top Ten", "Viewer Mail" became the "CBS Mailbag", etc.) ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine stated that "Letterman's innovation ... gained power from its rigorous formalism", as his biographer [[Jason Zinoman]] puts it, he was "a fascinatingly disgruntled eccentric trapped inside a more traditional talk show."&lt;ref&gt;[http://time.com/4728313/david-letterman-jason-zinoman/ "Letterman: A TV Traditionalist With a Weird Streak"] by Daniel D'Addario, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'',  April 17, 2017, p.&amp;nbsp;56&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Popularity ===
The main competitor of the ''Late Show'' was NBC's ''[[The Tonight Show]]'', which was [[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno|hosted by Jay Leno]] for 22 years&lt;!--Letterman started after Leno--&gt;, but from June 1, 2009, to January 22, 2010, was [[The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien|hosted]] by [[Conan O'Brien]]. In 1993 and 1994, the ''Late Show'' consistently gained higher ratings than ''The Tonight Show''. But in 1995, ratings dipped and Leno's show consistently beat Letterman's in the ratings from the time that [[Hugh Grant]] came on Leno's show after Grant's arrest for soliciting a prostitute;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2009-10-07/entertainment/letterman.show.ratings_1_local-people-meters-rating-points-viewers?_s=PM:SHOWBIZ|title=Viewers still in Letterman's corner|publisher=CNN|author=Breeanna Hare|date=October 7, 2009|accessdate=February 5, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314045142/http://articles.cnn.com/2009-10-07/entertainment/letterman.show.ratings_1_local-people-meters-rating-points-viewers?_s=PM%3ASHOWBIZ|archivedate=March 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leno typically attracted about five&amp;nbsp;million nightly viewers between 1999 and 2009. The ''Late Show'' lost nearly half its audience during its competition with Leno, attracting 7.1&amp;nbsp;million viewers nightly in its 1993–94 season and about 3.8&amp;nbsp;million per night as of Leno's departure in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/tv/articles/2009/05/31/conan_obriens_time_has_come__will_the_leno_faithful_follow|title=11:35pm&amp;nbsp;— Conan O'Brien's time has come.

Letterman's shows have garnered both critical and industry praise, receiving 67 [[Emmy Award]] nominations, winning 12 times in his first 20 years in late night television. From 1993 to 2009, Letterman ranked higher than Leno in the annual [[Harris Interactive|Harris Poll]] of ''Nation's Favorite TV Personality'' 12 times.&lt;ref name="harris09"/&gt; For example, in 2003 and 2004 Letterman ranked second in that poll, behind only [[Oprah Winfrey]], a year that Leno was ranked fifth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.harrisinteractive.com/harris_poll/index.asp?PID=530|title= For Third Year in a Row Oprah Retains Her Position as America's Favorite TV Personality|publisher=[[Harris Interactive|Harris Poll]]|date=December 29, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leno was higher than Letterman on that poll three times during the same period, in 1998, 2007, and 2008.&lt;ref name="harris09"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harrisinteractive.com/harris_poll/pubs/Harris_Poll_2009_01_28.pdf|title=America's Favorite Television Personality|publisher= a [[Harris Interactive|Harris Poll]]|date=January 28, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225170841/http://www.harrisinteractive.com/harris_poll/pubs/Harris_Poll_2009_01_28.pdf|archivedate=February 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hosting the Academy Awards ===
On March 27, 1995, Letterman acted as the host for the [[67th Academy Awards]] ceremony. Critics blasted Letterman for what they deemed a poor hosting of the Oscars, noting that his irreverent style undermined the traditional importance and glamor of the event.&lt;ref name="John O'Connor"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/29/movies/critic-s-notebook-the-winner-isn-t-david-letterman.html|title=The Winner Isn't David Letterman|work=The New York Times|author=John O'Connor|date=March 29, 1995|accessdate=December 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a joke about their unusual names (inspired by a celebrated comic essay in ''The New Yorker'', "Yma Dream" by Thomas Meehan), he started off by introducing [[Uma Thurman]] to [[Oprah Winfrey]], and then both of them to [[Keanu Reeves]]: "Oprah...Uma. Uma...Oprah," "Have you kids met Keanu?" This and many of his other jokes fell flat.&lt;ref name="John O'Connor" /&gt; Although Letterman attracted the highest ratings to the annual telecast since 1983, many felt that the bad publicity garnered by Letterman's hosting caused a decline in the ''Late Show'''s ratings.&lt;ref name="RS"&gt;{{cite news|first=Fred|last=Schruers|title= Dave vs. Dave: Forget Leno &amp; Koppel&amp;nbsp;— Letterman May Be His Own Worst Enemy|work=Rolling Stone|date=May 30, 1996|url=http://www.geocities.com/davidletterman82/RollingStone1996Interview.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071127145433/http://www.geocities.com/davidletterman82/RollingStone1996Interview.html|archivedate=November 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Letterman recycled the apparent debacle into a long-running gag. On his first show after the Oscars, he joked, "Looking back, I had no idea that thing was being televised." He lampooned his stint two years later, during [[Billy Crystal]]'s opening Oscar skit, which also parodied the plane-crashing scenes from that year's chief nominated film, ''[[The English Patient (film)|The English Patient]]''.

For years afterward, Letterman recounted his hosting the Oscars, although the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] continued to hold Letterman in high regard and they had invited him to host the Oscars again.&lt;ref name="NF"&gt;{{cite news|first=Nikki|last=Finke|title= The 411 about David Letterman &amp; Oscar|work=Deadline Hollywood Daily|date=February 25, 2008|url=http://www.deadline.com/2008/02/the-411-about-david-letterman-oscar/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bruce&gt;{{cite web|last=Keller|first=Joel|work=A.V.

=== Heart surgery hiatus ===
On January 14, 2000, a routine check-up revealed that an artery in Letterman's heart was severely obstructed. He was rushed to emergency surgery for a [[coronary artery bypass surgery|quintuple bypass]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/15/nyregion/artery-blocked-letterman-has-heart-bypass-surgery.html?sec=health|title = Artery Blocked, Letterman Has Heart Bypass Surgery| work = The New York Times| date = January 15, 2000| accessdate = March 23, 2009 | first=Tina | last=Kelley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the initial weeks of his recovery, reruns of the ''Late Show'' were shown and introduced by friends of Letterman including [[Drew Barrymore]],&lt;ref name="Who's loyal" /&gt; [[Ray Romano]], [[Robin Williams]], [[Bonnie Hunt]], [[Megan Mullally]], [[Bill Murray]], [[Regis Philbin]], [[Charles Grodin]], [[Nathan Lane]], [[Julia Roberts]],&lt;ref name="Who's loyal" /&gt; [[Bruce Willis]], [[Jerry Seinfeld]], [[Martin Short]], [[Steven Seagal]], [[Hillary Clinton]], [[Danny DeVito]], [[Steve Martin]], and [[Sarah Jessica Parker]].

Subsequently, while still recovering from surgery, Letterman revived the late night tradition that had virtually disappeared on network television during the 1990s of 'guest hosts' by allowing [[Bill Cosby]], [[Kathie Lee Gifford]], [[Dana Carvey]], [[Janeane Garofalo]], and others to host new episodes of the ''Late Show''.

Upon his return to the show on February 21, 2000, Letterman brought all but one of the doctors and nurses on stage who had participated in his surgery and recovery (with extra teasing of a nurse who had given him bed baths—"This woman has seen me naked!"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popstarsplus.com/celebrities_davidletterman.htm |title=David Letterman biography |publisher=Popstarsplus.com |accessdate=November 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; including Dr. O. Wayne Isom and physician [[Louis Aronne]], who frequently appeared on the show. In a show of emotion, Letterman was nearly in tears as he thanked the health care team with the words "These are the people who saved my life!" The episode earned an [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] nomination.

For a number of episodes, Letterman continued to crack jokes about his bypass, including saying, "Bypass surgery: it's when doctors surgically create new blood flow to your heart. A bypass is what happened to me when I didn't get ''The Tonight Show!'' It's a whole different thing." In a later running gag he lobbied his home state of Indiana to rename the freeway circling Indianapolis ([[Interstate 465|I-465]]) "The David Letterman Bypass." He also featured a montage of faux news coverage of his bypass surgery, which included a clip of Letterman's  heart for sale on the [[Home Shopping Network]]. Letterman became friends with his doctors and nurses. In 2008, a ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' interview stated &lt;blockquote&gt;he hosted a doctor and nurse who'd helped perform the emergency quintuple-bypass heart surgery that saved his life in 2000. 'These are people who were complete strangers when they opened my chest,' he says. 'And now, eight years later, they're among my best friends.'&lt;ref name="rs2008" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Additionally, Letterman invited the band [[Foo Fighters]] to play "[[Everlong]]",&lt;ref name="mtvfoo"&gt;{{cite web|title=Foo Fighters To Welcome Letterman Back To ''Late Show''|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1429027/20000216/foo_fighters.jhtml|last=Basham|first=David|publisher=MTV|date=February 16, 2000|accessdate=June 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; introducing them as "my favorite band, playing my favorite song."&lt;ref name="salonfoo"&gt;{{cite web|title=The top 10 reasons David Letterman's heart bypass operation was a good thing|url=http://www.salon.com/entertainment/col/mill/2000/03/20/letterman|last=Millman|first=Joyce|work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]|date=March 20, 2000|accessdate=June 5, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110211201550/http://www.salon.com/entertainment/col/mill/2000/03/20/letterman|archivedate=February 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a later Foo Fighters appearance, Letterman said that Foo Fighters had been in the middle of a South American tour which they canceled to come play on his comeback episode.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Letterman again handed over the reins of the show to several guest hosts (including [[Bill Cosby]], [[Brad Garrett]], [[Whoopi Goldberg]],&lt;ref name=EW2003&gt;{{cite news | last=Susman | first=Gary | date=March 10, 2003 | title=''Late Show'' returns, with guest hosts for still-ill Dave | publisher=''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' | url=http://www.ew.com/article/2003/03/10/late-show-returns-guest-hosts-still-ill-dave | access-date=July 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elvis Costello]],&lt;ref name=EW2003/&gt; [[John McEnroe]], [[Vince Vaughn]],&lt;ref name=EW2003/&gt; [[Will Ferrell]],&lt;ref name=EW2003/&gt; [[Bonnie Hunt]], [[Luke Wilson]] and bandleader [[Paul Shaffer]]) in February 2003, when he was diagnosed with a severe case of [[shingles]]. Later that year, Letterman made regular use of guest hosts—including [[Tom Arnold (actor)|Tom Arnold]] and [[Kelsey Grammer]]—for new shows broadcast on Fridays. In March 2007, [[Adam Sandler]]—who had been scheduled to be the lead guest—served as a guest host while Letterman was ill with a stomach virus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/20/arts/television/20cnd-letterman.html?ex=1175313600&amp;en=e887f76d9783d7e7&amp;ei=5070|title = Letterman is Ill, so Guest Takes Over Late Show| work = The New York Times|date = March 20, 2007| accessdate = March 29, 2007 | first=Bill | last=Carter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Re-signing with CBS ===
[[File:David Letterman.jpg|thumb|Letterman hosting President [[Barack Obama]] at ''Late Show with David Letterman'', September 2009]]
[[File:Dave Letterman.jpg|thumb|Letterman on the Late Show in 2011]]

In March 2002, as Letterman's contract with CBS neared expiration, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] offered him the time slot for long-running news program ''[[Nightline]]'' with [[Ted Koppel]]. Letterman was interested as he believed he could never match Leno's ratings at CBS due to Letterman's complaint of weaker [[lead-in]]s from the network's [[11 O'Clock News|late local news]] programs, but was reluctant to replace Koppel.&lt;ref name="battle"&gt;"[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20141116023540/http://www.aetv.com/listings/episode_details.do?episodeid=562114 The Battle for Late Night]" [[A&amp;E Network]], April 27, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Letterman addressed his decision to re-sign on the air, stating that he was content at CBS and that he had great respect for Koppel.

On December 4, 2006, [[CBS]] revealed that Letterman signed a new contract to host ''Late Show with David Letterman'' through the fall of 2010. "I'm thrilled to be continuing on at CBS," said Letterman. "At my age you really don't want to have to learn a new commute."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/650213242/Dave-will-outlast-Jay.html| title=Dave will outlast Jay| date= December 8, 2006| first=Scott D.| last= Pierce| newspaper= Deseret News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Letterman further joked about the subject by pulling up his right pants leg, revealing a tattoo, presumably temporary, of the ABC logo.

"Thirteen years ago, David Letterman put CBS late night on the map and in the process became one of the defining icons of our network," said [[Leslie Moonves]], president and CEO of CBS Corporation. &lt;blockquote&gt;His presence on our air is an ongoing source of pride, and the creativity and imagination that the ''Late Show'' puts forth every night is an ongoing display of the highest quality entertainment. We are truly honored that one of the most revered and talented entertainers of our time will continue to call CBS 'home.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbscorporation.com/news-article.php?id=13| title=CBS Signs David Letterman As Host Of The 'Late Show' Through Fall 2010| date=December 4, 2006| publisher=CBS}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to a 2007 article in ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine, Letterman earned {{US$|40}}&amp;nbsp;million a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = https://www.forbes.com/lists/2007/53/07celebrities_David-Letterman_C8CO.html|title = #17 David Letterman | work=Forbes | date=June 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2009 article in ''[[The New York Times]]'', however, said his salary was estimated at {{US$|32}}&amp;nbsp;million per year.&lt;ref name="nyt09carter" /&gt;  In June 2009, Letterman's Worldwide Pants and CBS reached agreement to continue the ''Late Show'' until at least August 2012. The previous contract had been set to expire in 2010, and the two-year extension is shorter than the typical three-year contract period negotiated in the past.&lt;ref name="nyt09carter"&gt;{{cite news| last=Carter |first=Bill |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/10/arts/television/10letterman.html |title=Letterman Reaches a Deal With CBS to Extend 'Late Show' |work= The New York Times |date=June 6, 2009 |accessdate=May 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Worldwide Pants agreed to lower its fee for the show, though it had remained a "solid moneymaker for CBS" under the previous contract.&lt;ref name="nyt09carter" /&gt;

On the February 3, 2011, edition of the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman|Late Show]]'', during an interview with [[Howard Stern]], Letterman said he would continue to do his talk show for "maybe two years, I think."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/is-david-letterman-ready-to-be-done-with-the-late-show/story/25084.html |title=Is David Letterman Ready to be Done with the Late Show? |first=Seth |last=Abramovitch |date=February 4, 2011 |publisher=[[TV.com]] |quote=Dave tried valiantly to change the subject to Stern's new Sirius deal, rumored to be worth even more than the $500&amp;nbsp;million contract he signed with them in 2005. But once again, Stern (now 57) turned the tables on Dave (now 63), asking the host, "How much longer are you doing this?" To which Letterman replied: "Maybe two years, I think?" |accessdate=June 17, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110416021903/http://www.tv.com/is-david-letterman-ready-to-be-done-with-the-late-show/story/25084.html |archivedate=April 16, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2012, CBS announced it had extended its contract with Letterman through 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304023504577321670048071482 |title=CBS Extends Letterman Contract Through 2014 | author= Christopher S.

=== Retirement from ''Late Show'' ===
During the taping of his April 3, 2014, show, Letterman announced that he had informed CBS president [[Leslie Moonves]] that he would retire from hosting ''Late Show'' by May 20, 2015.&lt;ref name=retire&gt;{{cite news|title=David Letterman to Retire From CBS' 'Late Show' in 2015 |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/david-letterman-retire-cbs-late-693420 |accessdate=April 3, 2014|newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter|date=April 3, 2014 |first=Lesley|last=Goldberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was announced soon after that comedian and political satirist [[Stephen Colbert]] would succeed Letterman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stephen Colbert Next Host of 'The Late Show'|url=http://www.cbs.com/shows/late_show/news/1002302/|publisher=CBS |accessdate=September 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Letterman's last episode aired on May 20, 2015, and opened with a presidential send off featuring four of the five living American presidents, [[George H. W. Bush]], [[Bill Clinton]], [[George W. Bush]] and [[Barack Obama]], each mimicking the late president [[Gerald Ford]]'s statement that "Our long national nightmare is over." It also featured cameos from ''[[The Simpsons]]'' and ''[[Wheel of Fortune (U.S. game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'' (the latter with a puzzle saying "Good riddance to David Letterman"), a Top Ten List of "things I wish I could have said to David Letterman" performed by regular guests including [[Alec Baldwin]], [[Barbara Walters]], [[Steve Martin]], [[Jerry Seinfeld]], [[Jim Carrey]], [[Chris Rock]], [[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]], [[Peyton Manning]], [[Tina Fey]], and [[Bill Murray]], and closed with a montage of scenes from both his CBS and NBC series set to a live performance of "[[Everlong]]" by [[Foo Fighters]].

The final episode of ''Late Show with David Letterman'' was watched by 13.76&amp;nbsp;million viewers in the United States with an audience share of 9.3/24, earning the show its highest ratings since following the 1994 Olympics on February 25, 1994, and the show's highest demo numbers (4.1 in adults 25–54 and 3.1 in adults 18–49) since Oprah Winfrey's first ''Late Show'' appearance following the ending of her feud with Letterman on December 1, 2005. [[Bill Murray]], who had been his first guest on ''Late Night'', was his final guest on ''Late Show''. In a rarity for a late-night show, it was also the highest-rated program on network television that night, beating out all prime-time shows.&lt;ref&gt;Nededog, Jethro (May 21, 2015).

In the months following the end of ''Late Show'' Letterman has been seen occasionally at sports events such as the [[Indianapolis 500]], during which he submitted to an interview with a local publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Exclusive Post-Retirement Interview with David Letterman |url=http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/arts-culture/exclusive-post-retirement-interview-david-letterman/|accessdate=July 12, 2015 |work=Indianapolis Monthly|date=June 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made a surprise appearance on stage in [[San Antonio]], Texas when he was invited up for an extended segment during [[Steve Martin]] and [[Martin Short]]'s ''A Very Stupid Conversation'' show saying "I retired, and...I have no regrets," Letterman told the crowd after walking on stage. "I was happy. I'll make actual friends. I was complacent. I was satisfied. I was content, and then a couple of days ago Donald Trump said he was running for president. I have made the biggest mistake of my life, ladies and gentlemen" and then delivering a Top Ten List roasting [[Donald Trump]]'s [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|presidential campaign]] followed by an on-stage conversation with Martin and Short.

He also interviewed Indian Prime Minister [[Narendra Modi]], and traveled to rural villages where power is a scarce luxury and explored the United States' role in India's energy future.&lt;ref name=PR&gt;[http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160808006030/en/Season-Emmy-Award-Winning-Critically-Acclaimed-Series-Years "Season Two of the Emmy Award-Winning and Critically Acclaimed Series Years of Living Dangerously Set to Premiere Sunday, Oct. 30, 8/7c Exclusively on National Geographic Channel"], National Geographic Channel and The Years Project, August 8, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable exchanges and incidents ==
[[File:David Letterman 2012.jpg|thumb|Letterman receiving the 2012 Kennedy Center Honors Medallion, December 2012]]

=== NBC and Johnny Carson ===
In spite of [[Johnny Carson]]'s clear intention to pass his title to Letterman, NBC selected [[Jay Leno]] to host ''The Tonight Show'' after Carson's departure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| work=The Independent|date=January 24, 2005|title=Johnny Carson, king of late-night chat, dies at 79| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/johnny-carson-king-of-latenight-chat-dies-at-79-488063.html| accessdate=July 6, 2009 | location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Letterman maintained a close relationship with Carson through his break with NBC. Three years after he left for CBS, [[HBO]] produced a made-for-television movie called ''[[The Late Shift (film)|The Late Shift]]'', based on a book by ''The New York Times'' reporter Bill Carter, chronicling the battle between Letterman and Leno for the coveted ''Tonight Show'' hosting spot.

Carson later made a few [[cameo appearance]]s as a guest on Letterman's show. Carson's final television appearance came May 13, 1994, on a ''Late Show'' episode taped in Los Angeles, when he made a surprise appearance during a '[[Top Ten list (David Letterman)|Top 10 list]]' segment. In early 2005, it was revealed that Carson occasionally sent jokes to Letterman, who used these jokes in his monologue; according to CBS senior vice president [[Peter Lassally]] (a one-time producer for both men), Carson got "a big kick out of it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.deseretnews.com/article/600106891/TV-critics-genuinely-fond-of-Carson.html| title= TV critics genuinely fond of Carson | date = January 24, 2005 | first = Scott D. | last = Pierce | accessdate = February 27, 2012|work = Deseret News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Letterman would do a characteristic Johnny Carson golf swing after delivering one of Carson's jokes. In a tribute to Carson, all of the opening monologue jokes during the first show following Carson's death were written by Carson.

Lassally also claimed that Carson had always believed Letterman, not Leno, to be his "rightful successor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| work=Fox News|title=Letterman Gets Jokes From Carson|date=January 20, 2005| url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2005/01/20/letterman-gets-jokes-from-carson.html| accessdate=May 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the early years of the ''Late Show''{{'}}s run, Letterman occasionally used some of Carson's trademark bits, including "[[Carnac the Magnificent]]" (with [[Paul Shaffer]] as Carnac), "Stump the Band", and the "Week in Review."

=== Oprah Winfrey ===
[[Oprah Winfrey]] appeared on Letterman's show when he was hosting NBC's ''Late Night'' on May 2, 1989.  Following that appearance, the two had a 16-year feud&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bauderap |first= David |url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/television/free-lunch-behind-16-year-letterman-oprah-feud/story-e6frfmyi-1225932672545 |title=Free lunch behind 16-year Letterman, Oprah feud |publisher=News.com.au |date=October 1, 2010 |accessdate=May 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which arose, as Winfrey explained to Letterman after the feud had been resolved, as a result of the acerbic tone of their 1989 interview of which she said that it "felt so uncomfortable to me that I didn't want to have that experience again".

The feud apparently ended in 2005 when Winfrey appeared on CBS's ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' on December 2, in an event Letterman jokingly referred to as "the [[Super Bowl]] of Love".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tv.yahoo.com/show/32704/news/urn:newsml:tv.ap.org:20070830:people_winfrey_letterman__ER:1759 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070906075743/http://tv.yahoo.com/show/32704/news/urn%3Anewsml%3Atv.ap.org%3A20070830%3Apeople_winfrey_letterman__ER%3A1759 |archivedate=September 6, 2007 |publisher=[[Yahoo!]] |title=Letterman to appear on `Oprah' |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Winfrey and Letterman also appeared together in a ''Late Show'' promo that aired during CBS's coverage of [[Super Bowl XLI]] in February 2007, with the two sitting next to each other on the couch watching the game. Since the game was played between the [[Indianapolis Colts]] and [[Chicago Bears]], the Indianapolis-born Letterman wears a [[Peyton Manning]] jersey, while Winfrey—whose show was taped in Chicago—wears a [[Brian Urlacher]] jersey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_i5we6MB-w|publisher=YouTube|title=Dave and Oprah's Super Bowl of Love}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 10, 2007, Letterman made his first appearance on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' at [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York City.

Three years later, during CBS's coverage of [[Super Bowl XLIV]], the two appeared again in a ''Late Show'' promo, this time with Winfrey sitting on a couch between Letterman and Jay Leno. This time Letterman was wearing the retired {{Abbr|No.|Number}} 70 jersey of Colts' Hall of Fame and Letterman regular guest, [[Art Donovan]] (the Colts faced the [[New Orleans Saints]] in this Super Bowl). The appearance was Letterman's idea: Leno flew to New York City on an NBC corporate jet, sneaking into the Ed Sullivan Theater during the ''Late Show'''s February 4 taping wearing a disguise, meeting Winfrey and Letterman at a living room set created in the theater's balcony where they taped their promo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title= How the Letterman-Oprah-Leno Super Bowl Ad Came Together | url= http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/02/07/how-the-letterman-oprah-leno-super-bowl-ad-came-together/ | publisher=Media Decoder | date=  February 7, 2010 | accessdate=February 8, 2010 | first= Bill |last=Carter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Winfrey interviewed Letterman in January 2013 on ''[[Oprah's Next Chapter]]''.  Winfrey and Letterman discussed their feud during the interview and Winfrey revealed that she had had a "terrible experience" while appearing on Letterman's show years earlier.  Letterman could not recall the incident but apologized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=  Letterman On 'Oprah's Next Chapter': 'I'm Sorry' (VIDEO) | url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/10/letterman-on-oprah-david-letterman_n_2427870.html | work= The Huffington Post | date=  January 12, 2013 | accessdate=April 1, 2013 | first=Joan | last=Podrazik}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2007–2008 writers' strike ===
''Late Show'' went off air for eight weeks during the months of November and December because of the [[2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike|Writers Guild of America strike]]. Letterman's production company, Worldwide Pants, was the first company to make an individual agreement with the WGA,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wga.org/subpage_member.aspx?id=2692 |publisher=Writers Guild of America West|title=e-mail 12-28-07 "Letter from the Presidents : To Our Fellow Members"|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080102203501/http://www.wga.org/subpage_member.aspx?id=2692 |archivedate=January 2, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; thus allowing his show to come back on air on January 2, 2008. On his first episode since being off air, he surprised the viewing audience with his newly grown [[beard]], which signified solidarity with the strike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2008-01-02-late-night-strike_N.htm| title = Late-night shows return fully bearded&amp;nbsp;— with and without writers| author = Gary Levin| work = [[USA Today]]| date = January 3, 2008| accessdate = January 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His beard was shaved off during the show on January 7, 2008.

=== Palin joke ===
On June 8 and 9, 2009, Letterman told two sexually themed jokes about a daughter (never named) of [[Sarah Palin]] on his TV show.&lt;ref name="NOW"&gt;{{cite news|url  =http://www.now.org/issues/media/hall-of-shame/index.php/television/letterman-palin-daughter| title = Letterman "Jokes" About Palin's Daughter| author = Lisa Bennett| publisher = [[National Organization for Women|NOW]]| date = June 11, 2009| accessdate = April 27, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090615051330/http://www.now.org/issues/media/hall-of-shame/index.php/television/letterman-palin-daughter|archivedate=June 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Palin was in New York City at the time with her then fourteen-year-old daughter, Willow, and some contemporaries thought the jokes to be aimed at Willow, which caused some small amount of controversy.&lt;ref name="NOW"/&gt;

In a statement posted on the Internet, Palin said, "I doubt [Letterman would] ever dare make such comments about anyone else's daughter" and that "laughter incited by sexually perverted comments made by a 62-year-old male celebrity aimed at a 14-year-old girl is disgusting."&lt;ref name="Palin vs. Letterman – ABC News"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2009/06/palin-vs-letterman|title=Palin vs. Letterman|author=Caitlin Taylor|publisher=[[ABC News]]|date=June 11, 2009|accessdate=April 27, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120216043242/http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2009/06/palin-vs-letterman|archivedate=February 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On his show of June 10, Letterman responded to the controversy, saying the jokes were meant to be about Palin's eighteen-year-old daughter, [[Bristol Palin|Bristol]], whose pregnancy as an unmarried teenager had caused some controversy during the [[United States presidential election of 2008]]. "These are not jokes made about (Palin's) 14-year-old daughter ... I would never, never make jokes about raping or having sex of any description with a 14-year-old girl."&lt;ref name="Palin vs. Letterman – ABC News"/&gt;

His remarks did not put an end to public criticism, however. The [[National Organization for Women]] (NOW) released a statement supporting Palin, noting that Letterman had made "[only] something of an apology."&lt;ref name="NOW"/&gt; When the controversy failed to subside, Letterman addressed the issue again on his show of June 15, faulting himself for the error and apologizing "especially to the two daughters involved, Bristol and Willow, and also to the governor and her family and everybody else who was outraged by the joke."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/15/AR2009061503131.html?hpid=topnews|title=One Pregnant-Teen Joke Too Many?

=== Al-Qaeda death threat ===
On August 17, 2011, it was reported that an [[Islamic militants|Islamist militant]] had posted a death threat against Letterman on a website frequented by [[Al-Qaeda]] supporters, calling on American Muslims to kill Letterman for making a joke about the death of an Al-Qaeda leader, killed in a drone strike in Pakistan in June 2011, [[Ilyas Kashmiri]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/08/17/us-davidletterman-idUSTRE77G6K520110817| title=Militant makes death threat against David Letterman| agency=Reuters| date=August 17, 2011| accessdate=August 18, 2011| first=Jill| last=Serjeant}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his show on August 22, Letterman joked about the threat, saying "State Department authorities are looking into this. They're not taking this lightly. They're looking into it. They're questioning, they're interrogating, there's an electronic trail—but everybody knows it's [[Jay Leno|Leno]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/22/letterman-responds-to-death-threats-in-monologue/| date=August 22, 2011| title=Letterman Responds to Death Threats in Monologue| first=Bill | last=Carter| newspaper= The New York Times| accessdate=August 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Letterman suffers from [[Tinnitus|tinnitus (ringing in the ears)]], which is a symptom of [[hearing loss]]. On the ''Late Show'' in 1996, Letterman talked about his tinnitus in an interview he did with actor [[William Shatner]], who has severe tinnitus himself, caused from an on-set explosion. Letterman said at first he could not figure out where the noise in his head was coming from and that he hears constant noises and ringing in his ears 24 hours a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x96y7t_david-letterman-with-william-shatne_shortfilms|title=David Letterman with William Shatner – March, 1996!!|author=Ray Glasser|work=Dailymotion}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCdx8aueK9I|title=David Letterman with William Shatner – March, 1996!!|first=|last=videoholicULTIMATE|date=July 28, 2013|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Letterman no longer drinks alcohol. On more than one occasion, he said that he had once been a "horrible alcoholic" and had begun drinking around the age of 13 and continued until 1981 when he was 34. He recounts in 1981, "I was drunk 80% of the time. ... I loved it. I was one of those guys, I looked around, and everyone else had stopped drinking and I couldn't understand why."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmQcHhV9ChM&amp;t=3m49s|title=This video is unavailable.|work=youtube.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBF8LIr8RG4&amp;t=7m34s|title=Amanda Seyfried al David Letterman 12-12-2012|date=December 13, 2012|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he is shown drinking on the ''Late Show'' (or, before that, on ''Late Night'') what appears to be alcohol, it is actually replaced with apple juice by the crew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbs.com/shows/late_show/wahoo_gazette/160277/|title=That ain't apple juice.

He became calmer through a combination of [[transcendental meditation]] and low doses of medication.&lt;ref name="rollingstone"&gt;{{cite news|title=David Letterman Says Goodbye: Inside Rolling Stone's New Issue|author=Mark Seliger |newspaper=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=May 6, 2015|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/news/david-letterman-says-goodbye-inside-rolling-stones-new-issue-20150506|accessdate=May 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their son, Liam Letterman Shelton, attended Letterman's ''alma mater'', [[Ball State University]] in [[Muncie, Indiana]], where Letterman funded the journalism school, and studied a four-year double major in journalism news/telecommunications news.&lt;ref name="2017-05-04_SP"&gt;Seth Slabaugh,[http://www.militarytimes.com/articles/david-letterman-nephew David Letterman's nephew, in ROTC, to start military career after graduation Saturday], ''[[The Star Press]]'', May 4, 2017; accessed May 10, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stalker===
Beginning in May 1988, Letterman was [[stalking|stalked]] by [[Margaret Mary Ray]], a woman suffering from [[schizophrenia]]. She stole his [[Porsche]], camped out on his tennis court, and repeatedly broke into his house. Her exploits drew national attention, with Letterman occasionally joking about her on his show, although he never referred to her by name. After she committed suicide in October 1998, Letterman told ''The New York Times'' that he had great compassion for her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/22/nyregion/behind-jokes-life-pain-delusion-for-letterman-stalker-mental-illness-was-family.html|title=For Letterman Stalker, Mental Illness Was Family Curse and Scarring Legacy|work=The New York Times|first=Frank|last=Bruni|date=November 22, 1998|accessdate=May 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A spokesperson for Letterman said: "This is a sad ending to a confused life."&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, Babara, [https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/07/nyregion/the-woman-who-stalked-letterman-is-a-suicide.html "The Woman Who Stalked Letterman Is a Suicide"], ''The New York Times'', October 7, 1998; retrieved September 11, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extramarital affairs and blackmail attempt {{anchor|Extortion attempt and revelation of affairs}}===
On October 1, 2009, Letterman announced on his show that he had been the victim of a [[blackmail]] attempt by someone threatening to reveal that he'd had sex with several of his female employees, and at the same time, he confirmed that he had such relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2009/10/david-letterman-on-extortion-attempt-i-felt-menaced-by-this.html| title=David Letterman on extortion attempt: 'I felt menaced by this'| first=Matea| last=Gold| newspaper=Los Angeles Times| date= October 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that three weeks earlier (on September 9, 2009) someone had left a package in his car with material he said he would write into a screenplay and a book if Letterman did not pay him {{US$|2}}&amp;nbsp;million. Letterman said that he contacted the [[New York County District Attorney|Manhattan District Attorney's office]], ultimately cooperating with them to conduct a [[sting operation]] involving giving the man a phony check.&lt;ref name="CBS"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/robert-joe-halderman-48-hours-producer-named-in-david-letterman-sex-extortion-plot/|title=Robert Joe Halderman, 48 Hours Producer, Named in David Letterman Sex Extortion Plot|first=Edecio|last=Martinez|publisher=CBS News|date=October 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, [[Joe Halderman|Robert J. "Joe" Halderman]], a producer of the CBS [[true crime]] journalism series ''[[48 Hours (TV series)|48 Hours]]'', was arrested after trying to deposit the check. He was indicted by a Manhattan [[grand jury]] and pleaded not guilty to a charge of attempted [[grand larceny]] on October 2, 2009.&lt;ref name=Reuters1002&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idUSTRE5910GR20091002|title=Suspect in Letterman extortion pleads not guilty|date=September 2, 2009| last=Honan|first=Edith|agency=Reuters|accessdate=October 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, on March 9, 2010, he pleaded guilty to this same felony and served a six-month jail sentence, followed by probation and community service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ex-CBS producer Robert Halderman pleads guilty to blackmailing David Letterman over intern affairs| date=March 9, 2010| accessdate=March 10, 2010|newspaper=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]] |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2010/03/09/2010-03-09_david_letterman_blackmailer_robert_halderman_will_plead_guilty_take_sixmonth_jai.html|first1=Melissa|last1=Grace|first2=Christina|last2=Boyle|first3=Larry|last3=McShane}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A central figure in the case and one of the women with whom Letterman had had a sexual relationship was his longtime personal assistant [[Stephanie Birkitt]], who often appeared with him on his show. She had also worked for ''48 Hours''.&lt;ref name="huffpo"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/10/02/stephanie-birkitt-letterm_n_307558.html|title=Stephanie Birkitt|last=Shea|first=Danny|date=October 2, 2009|newspaper=[[The Huffington Post]]|accessdate=October 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until a month prior to the revelations, she had shared a residence with Halderman,&lt;ref name="NYT1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/03/business/media/03extort.html|title=Letterman Extortion Raises Questions for CBS|first1=Bill| last1=Carter|first2=Brian|last2=Stelter| newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; who allegedly had copied her personal diary and used it, along with private emails, in the blackmail package.&lt;ref name="diary"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/stephanie-birkitt-photo-secret-diary-at-center-of-letterman-sex-extortion-say-cops/|title=Stephanie Birkitt Secret Diary at Center of Letterman Sex Extortion, Say Cops|date=October 5, 2009|newspaper=CBS News|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=October 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the days following the initial announcement of the affairs and the arrest, several prominent women, including [[Kathie Lee Gifford]], co-host of NBC's ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today Show]]'', and [[NBC]] [[news anchor]] [[Ann Curry]] questioned whether Letterman's affairs with subordinates created an unfair working environment.&lt;ref name=bauder&gt;{{cite news|title=Will women viewers turn away from Letterman?|agency=Associated Press|date=October 4, 2009|accessdate=October 4, 2009| url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/33167148/ns/today-entertainment/t/will-women-viewers-turn-away-letterman}}&lt;/ref&gt; A spokesman for Worldwide Pants said that the company's [[sexual harassment]] policy did not prohibit sexual relationships between managers and employees.&lt;ref name=latimesharassment&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-letterman3-2009oct03-story.html|title=David Letterman affair is no joke|first1=Matea|last1=Gold|first2=Scott|last2=Collins|date=October 3, 2009|accessdate=October 4, 2009|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|quote='We have a written policy in our employee manual that covers harassment', the spokesman said in a statement. 'It is circulated to every employee every year. Dave is not in violation of our policy and no one has ever raised a complaint against him.'}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to business news reporter Eve Tahmincioglu, "CBS suppliers are supposed to follow the company's business conduct policies" and the CBS 2008 Business Conduct Statement states that "If a consenting romantic or sexual relationship between a supervisor and a direct or indirect subordinate should develop, CBS requires the supervisor to disclose this information to his or her Company's Human Resources Department...".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sleeping with the boss often leads to trouble: Policies on workplace romances aim to limit legal liabilities|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/33146450/ns/business-careers|first=Eve|last=Tahmincioglu|date=October 4, 2009|accessdate=October 4, 2009|publisher=[[MSNBC]]|quote=If a consenting romantic or sexual relationship between a supervisor and a direct or indirect subordinate should develop, CBS requires the supervisor to disclose this information to his or her Company's Human Resources Department to ensure that there are no issues of actual or apparent favoritism, [[conflict of interest]], [[sexual harassment]], or any other negative impact on others in the work environment.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 3, 2009, a former CBS employee, Holly Hester, announced that she and Letterman had engaged in a year-long "secret" affair in the early 1990s while she was his intern and a student at [[New York University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/late_show_staff_gals_got_plenty_QzBeMomGK52ixJtyl0Z8kI|work=[[New York Post]]|title='Late Show' staff gals got plenty of 'advances'|first1=Susannah|last1=Cahalan|first2=Annie|last2=Karni|first3=Stephanie|last3=Cohen|date=October 4, 2009|accessdate=October 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 5, 2009, Letterman devoted a segment of his show to a public apology to his wife and staff.&lt;ref name=msnbcapology&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/33184320/ns/entertainment-television|title=Letterman apologizes to wife on Monday's show: Late-night host says Regina Lasko has been 'horribly hurt' by his behavior|agency=Associated Press|publisher=[[MSNBC]]|date=October 5, 2009| accessdate=October 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cnnapology&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/TV/10/05/david.letterman.apology|title=Letterman makes in-studio apology to wife, staffers|author=Doug Ganley|publisher=CNN|date=October 5, 2009|accessdate= October 5, 2009|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three days later, Worldwide Pants announced that Birkitt had been placed on a "paid leave of absence" from the ''Late Show''.&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;{{cite news|title=David Letterman's former mistress Stephanie Birkitt banned from Late Show set|date=October 8, 2009|accessdate=October 12, 2009|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|location=London|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/6271085/David-Lettermans-former-mistress-Stephanie-Birkitt-banned-from-Late-Show-set.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 15, CBS News announced that the company's Chief [[Investigative journalist|Investigative Correspondent]], [[Armen Keteyian]], had been assigned to conduct an "in-depth investigation" into Letterman.&lt;ref name=foxCBSinvestigation&gt;{{cite news|title=Network's correspondent probing Dave's extortion scandal|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/item_d9zwWsNX2hw5DMFJsuh5LO|newspaper=New York Post|first=Dan|last=Mangan|date=October 15, 2009|accessdate=October 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cars===
Letterman is a car enthusiast, and owns an extensive collection.  In 2012, it was reported that the collection consisted of ten Ferraris, eight Porsches, four Austin Healeys, two Honda motorcycles, a Chevy pickup and one car each from automakers Mercedes-Benz, Jaguar, MG, Volvo, and Pontiac.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Koonz|first1=Brian|title=David Letterman's 10 Ferraris stored at Danbury warehouse|url=http://www.ctpost.com/local/article/David-Letterman-s-10-Ferraris-stored-at-Danbury-3518591.php|website=ctpost|publisher=Hearst Media Services Connecticut, LLC|accessdate=February 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his [[Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee#Season 2 (2013)|2013 appearance]] on ''[[Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee]]'', part of [[Jerry Seinfeld]]'s conversation with Letterman was filmed in Letterman's outwardly unassuming [[Volvo 900 Series#1994–1998|1995 Volvo 960 station wagon]] that is powered by a 380-horsepower racing engine. [[Paul Newman]] had the car built for Letterman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Locker|first1=Melissa|title=Watch Jerry Seinfeld and David Letterman in ''Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee''|url=http://www.ifc.com/2013/06/watch-jerry-seinfeld-and-david-letterman-in-comedians-in-cars-getting-coffee|website=IFC|publisher=AMC Networks|accessdate=March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foo Fighters===
Letterman shares a close relationship with the rock and roll band [[Foo Fighters]] since their appearance on his first show upon his return from heart surgery (see section "Heart surgery hiatus" for more information).  The band appeared many times on the ''Late Show'' (see section "Retirement from Late Show" for more information), including a week-long stint in October 2014.

While introducing the band's performance of "[[Miracle (Foo Fighters song)|Miracle]]" on the show of October 17, 2014, Letterman told the story of how a souvenir video of himself and his four-year-old son learning to ski used the song as background music, unbeknownst to Letterman until he saw it.  He said "This is the second song of theirs that will always have great, great meaning for me for the rest of my life".  This was the first time the band had heard this story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Foo Fighters – Miracle [Live on David Letterman]|url=https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x284e70|website=dailymotion|publisher=Dailymotion|accessdate=December 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bradley|first1=Laura|title=A Brief History of David Letterman’s Love for the Foo Fighters|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2015/05/21/a_brief_history_of_david_letterman_s_love_for_the_foo_fighters.html|website=Brow Beat|publisher=The Slate group|accessdate=December 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Worldwide Pants co-produced [[Dave Grohl]]'s ''[[Foo Fighters: Sonic Highways|Sonic Highways]]'' TV series. "Letterman was the first person to get behind this project," Grohl admitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kreps|first1=Daniel|title=Foo Fighters to Serve as Letterman's Final Musical Guest|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/foo-fighters-to-serve-as-lettermans-final-musical-guest-20150520|website=Rolling Stone|publisher=Rolling Stone|accessdate=December 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and honors==
===David Letterman Communication and Media Building===
On September 7, 2007, Letterman visited his ''alma mater'', [[Ball State University]] in [[Muncie, Indiana]], for the dedication of a communications facility named in his honor for his dedication to the university. The {{US$|21}}&amp;nbsp;million, {{convert |75000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} David Letterman Communication and Media Building opened for the 2007 fall semester. Thousands of Ball State students, faculty, and local residents welcomed Letterman back to Indiana.&lt;ref name="building"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.indystar.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=200781121039|title=It's no joke: Ball State dedicates building in Letterman's honor|publisher=indystar.com|first=Christopher|last=Lloyd|date=September 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Letterman's emotional speech touched on his struggles as a college student and his late father, and also included the "top ten good things about having your name on a building", finishing with "if reasonable people can put my name on a {{US$|21}}&amp;nbsp;million building, anything is possible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|url=http://www.bsu.edu/web/news/letterman|people=Ball State University|title=David Letterman Communication and Media Building|date=September 7, 2007| medium=videos}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over many years Letterman "[[The Letterman Foundation for Courtesy and Grooming#Ball State|has provided substantial assistance]] to [Ball State's] Department of Telecommunications, including an annual scholarship that bears his name."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bsu.edu/news/article/0,1370,311998-18969-54275,00.html|title=World-class facilities, faculty, and students|date=August 28, 2007|publisher=Ball State University|accessdate=December 4, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070813223734/http://bsu.edu/news/article/0%2C1370%2C311998-18969-54275%2C00.html |archivedate=August 13, 2007|quote=The new technologically advanced facility is named after David Letterman, the university's most prominent graduate and host of the ''Late Show with David Letterman'' on the CBS television network.

Work began on the {{US$|21}}&amp;nbsp;million building in 2005, enclosing about 75,000 square feet of classroom, studio, and faculty office space. The building opened in August. Cutting-edge equipment populates the {{US$|1}}&amp;nbsp;million production complex, which includes two recording studios, two control rooms, two isolation rooms, and five editing suites. The same equipment may be found in most of the top production houses and film studios in Hollywood, New York, and London|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, Letterman received a [[Sagamore of the Wabash]] award given by Indiana Governor [[Mitch Daniels]], which recognizes distinguished service to the state of Indiana.&lt;ref name="building"/&gt;

===Awards and nominations===
In his capacities as either a performer, producer, or as part of a writing team, Letterman is among the most nominated people in the history of the [[Emmy Award]]s with 52 nominations, winning two Daytime Emmys and ten Primetime Emmys since 1981. He won four [[American Comedy Awards]] and in 2011 became the first recipient of the Johnny Carson Award for Comedic Excellence at [[The Comedy Awards]].{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}
