He won a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program|Primetime Emmy Award]] for the 2007 documentary ''[[Mr. Warmth: The Don Rickles Project]]''.

==Early life==
Donald Jay Rickles was born to [[Jews|Jewish]] parents in [[Queens]], [[New York (state)|New York]], on May 8, 1926.&lt;ref name="dummy" /&gt; His father Max Rickles (1897-1953) emigrated in 1903 with his Lithuanian parents from [[Kaunas]]&lt;ref&gt;World War I draft registration, NY City, #31-9-149-B, Max S. Rickles, born August 12, 1897 in Kovna (Kaunas), Russia&lt;/ref&gt; (then in the [[Russian Empire]]), and his mother, Etta (''née'' Feldman) (1898-1984), was born in New York City to Austrian immigrant parents.&lt;ref&gt;US Census, 1930.

Accessed October 8, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating from [[Newtown High School (New York City)|Newtown High School]], Rickles enlisted in the [[United States Navy]] and served during [[World War II]] on the [[motor torpedo boat tender]] [[USS Cyrene (AGP-13)|USS ''Cyrene'']] (AGP-13) as a [[seaman]] first class. He was [[Honorable discharge|honorably discharged]] in 1946.&lt;ref name="Post"&gt;{{cite news |last=Heller |first=Karen |date=May 26, 2016 |title=90 Years Old and Still Zinging |work=The Washington Post |pages=C1-C2 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/don-rickles-was-politically-incorrect-before-it-was-incorrect-and-hes-still-going-at-90/2016/05/24/3b5e0422-1868-11e6-924d-838753295f9a_story.html |accessdate=June 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, intending to be a dramatic actor, he studied at the [[American Academy of Dramatic Arts]] and then played bit parts on television. Frustrated by a lack of acting work, Rickles began performing comedy in clubs in New York, Miami, and Los Angeles. He became known as an [[insult comedian]] when he responded to his [[heckler]]s. The audience enjoyed these insults more than his prepared material, so he incorporated them into his act.&lt;ref name=allmusic&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/don-rickles-mn0000193606/biography |title=Artist Biography |author=Ankeny, Jason |access-date=October 20, 2016 |work=[[AllMusic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When he began his career in the early 1950s, he started calling ill-mannered members of the audience "hockey pucks".&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'' April 15, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; His style was similar to that of an older insult comic, [[Jack E. Leonard]], though Rickles denied Leonard influenced his style.&lt;ref name="couch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comedycouch.com/interviews/drickles.htm|author=MacPherson, Guy|title=Don Rickles Interview|publisher=The Comedy Couch|date=October 6, 2006|access-date=May 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During an interview on ''[[Larry King Live]]'', Rickles credited [[Milton Berle]]'s comedy style for inspiring him to enter show business.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XMNqakiGzw;t=11m11s Don Rickles on Larry King Show], 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===1950s–1960s===
While working in the "Murray Franklin's" nightclub in [[Miami Beach, Florida]], early in his career, Rickles spotted [[Frank Sinatra]] and remarked to him, "I just saw your movie ''[[The Pride and the Passion]]'' and I want to tell you, the cannon's acting was great." He added, "Make yourself at home, Frank. Hit somebody!"&lt;ref name="dummy" /&gt;&lt;ref name="puck" /&gt; Sinatra, whose pet name for Rickles was "bullet-head", enjoyed him so much that he encouraged other celebrities to see Rickles' act and be insulted by him. Sinatra's support helped Rickles become a popular headline performer in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]].&lt;ref name="puck"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehockeypuck.com/bio.html|title=Biography|publisher=The Hockey Puck|access-date=May 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5_V9RT8aR8|title=Frank Sinatra is Surprised by Don Rickles on Johnny Carson's Show, Funniest Moment|first=|last=Johnny Carson|date=August 3, 2011|publisher=|access-date=April 6, 2017|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a ''[[The Dean Martin Celebrity Roast|Dean Martin Celebrity Roast]]'' special, Rickles was among those who took part in [[Roast (comedy)|roast]]ing Sinatra,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-KeTNU-ods Don Rickles roasts Frank Sinatra], Dean Martin special&lt;/ref&gt; and Rickles, too, was also roasted during another show in the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdPcjIrSvcs |title=Comedian Foster Brooks roasts Don Rickles |publisher=YouTube |date=December 13, 2008 |accessdate=April 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rickles earned the nicknames "The Merchant of Venom" and "Mr. Warmth"&lt;ref name=allmusic/&gt;&lt;ref name=latimes&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/showtracker/la-et-st-0624-don-rickles-20130624-story.html |title=Don Rickles to be honored for busting people's chops |date=June 24, 2013 | author=King, Susan |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |access-date=October 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; for his poking fun at people of all ethnicities and walks of life. When he was introduced to an audience or on a television talk show, Spanish [[matador]] music, "La Virgen de la Macarena", would usually be played, subtly foreshadowing someone was about to be metaphorically gored. Rickles said, "I always pictured myself facing the audience as the matador."&lt;ref name="couch" /&gt;

In 1958, he made his film debut in a serious part in ''[[Run Silent, Run Deep (1958 film)|Run Silent, Run Deep]]'' with [[Clark Gable]] and [[Burt Lancaster]].&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt; Throughout the 1960s, he often appeared on television in sitcoms and dramatic series. Rickles guest-starred in ''[[Get Smart]]'' as Sid, an old war buddy of Max who comes to stay with him. In an episode of the 1960s drama series ''[[Run for Your Life (TV series)|Run for Your Life]]'', Rickles portrayed a distressed comedian whose act culminates when he strangles a patron while imploring the patron to "Laugh!" Rickles took a dramatic turn in the low-budget [[Roger Corman]] film ''[[X (1963 film)|X: The Man with the X-Ray Eyes]]'' as a [[carnival barker]] out to exploit the title character (portrayed by [[Ray Milland]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2017/04/don-rickles-dies-legendary-comic-90-1202063770/|title=Don Rickles Dies: Legendary Comedian Was 90|first=Denise|last=Petski|date=April 6, 2017|publisher=|access-date=April 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Don Rickles and Lorne Green.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Rickles and [[Lorne Greene]] on ''The Don Rickles Show'' in 1968]]
Rickles appeared in the ''[[Beach Party film|Beach Party]]'' film series. He recalled in his 2007 memoir that at a [[White House]] dinner, [[Barbara Bush]] teased him about his decision to appear in those films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5IbANRNF1UIC&amp;lpg=PA202&amp;dq=rickles%20memoir%20bush&amp;pg=PA202#v=onepage&amp;q=rickles%20memoir%20bush&amp;f=false | title=Rickles' Book: A Memoir |author=Rickles, Don and David Ritz |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |isbn=978-0-7432-9305-1 |year=2007 |page=202}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rickles' agent, [[Jack Gilardi]], was married to [[Annette Funicello]] when Rickles was cast in the ''Beach Party'' films. He subsequently began appearing more frequently on television talk shows, first appearing on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' in 1965.&lt;ref name=allmusic/&gt;

He became a frequent guest and guest host, appearing more than 100 times on ''The Tonight Show'' during Carson's era. An early Carson-Rickles ''Tonight'' highlight occurred in 1968 when, while two Japanese women treated Carson to a bath and massage by foot, Rickles walked onto the set.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|gauYtZ8S1zs}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also made frequent appearances on ''[[The Dean Martin Show]]'' and became a fixture on ''[[The Dean Martin Celebrity Roast]]'' specials.&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt;

In 1968, Rickles released a live comedy album ''[[Hello, Dummy!]]'', which reached #54 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] album chart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p218|pure_url=yes}}|title =Don Rickles Charts &amp; Awards|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=May 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year he starred in his own variety show on ABC, ''The Don Rickles Show'', with comedy writer Pat McCormick as his sidekick. The show lasted one season. During the 1960s, Rickles made guest appearances on ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]'', ''[[The Munsters]]'', ''[[The Addams Family]]'', ''[[The Mothers-in-Law]]'', ''[[Gilligan's Island]]'', ''[[Get Smart]]'', ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'', ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'', ''[[Gomer Pyle]]'' and ''[[I Dream of Jeannie]]''.

In his memoir, Rickles acknowledged a scripted sitcom was not well-suited to his ad-lib style of performing.&lt;ref name=latimes_obit&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/la-me-don-rickles-snap-20170406-story.html|title=Don Rickles, aggressively caustic comedian dubbed 'Mr. Warmth,' dies at 90|date=April 6, 2017|publisher=|access-date=April 6, 2017|via=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 1973, he became a popular comedian appearing on ''[[The Dean Martin Celebrity Roast]]'' specials. In 1976–1978, he starred in ''[[C.P.O. Sharkey]]'', which lasted two seasons.&lt;ref name=latimes_obit/&gt; The series is primarily remembered for the [[C.P.O. Sharkey#The cigarette box incident|cigarette box incident]] when [[Johnny Carson]] did an impromptu surprise visit during an episode's taping because he was "incensed" Rickles broke his cigarette box while he chatted with [[Bob Newhart]] (who was sitting in for Carson as the guest host of ''[[The Tonight Show]]'') on the previous night's show. The incident was often replayed in ''Tonight Show'' [[retrospective]]s and was considered a highlight of the 1970s era of the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/17/arts/television/don-rickles-recalls-his-cpo-sharkey-days.html|title=Don Rickles Recalls His ‘CPO Sharkey’ Days|first=Dave|last=Itzkoff|date=May 15, 2015|publisher=|access-date=April 6, 2017|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rickles occasionally appeared as a panelist on ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'' and was depicted in comic book form by [[Jack Kirby]] during his work on the ''[[Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen]]'' series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McAvennie|first= Michael|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1970s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 146|quote = In one of Jack Kirby's strangest tales, Jimmy Olsen met real-world funnyman Don Rickles' costumed likeness, 'Goody' Rickles.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic| writer= [[Jack Kirby|Kirby, Jack]]| penciller= Kirby, Jack| inker= [[Vince Colletta|Colletta, Vince]]| story= The Guardian Fights Again!!!| title= Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen| issue= 139| date= July 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic| writer= Kirby, Jack| penciller= Kirby, Jack| inker= Colletta, Vince| story= Will The Real Don Rickles Panic?!?| title= Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen| issue= 141| date= September 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1980s, Rickles began performing with [[Steve Lawrence]] in concerts in [[Las Vegas]]. In 1983, the duo co-hosted ''[[Foul-Ups, Bleeps &amp; Blunders]]'', an imitation of ''[[TV's Bloopers &amp; Practical Jokes]]''. In 1985, when [[Frank Sinatra]] was asked to perform at [[Ronald Reagan]]'s Second [[United States presidential inaugural balls|Inaugural Ball]], he insisted that Rickles be allowed to perform and do it unrehearsed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XMNqakiGzw;t=17m33s |title=Don Rickles discussing Reagan inaugural performance |publisher=YouTube |date=December 25, 2016 |accessdate=April 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3kJ7VPJnmI |title=Don Rickles performing at Ronald Reagan's 2nd inaugural |publisher=YouTube |date=March 5, 2011 |accessdate=April 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rickles considered this performance the highlight of his career.&lt;ref name="insults"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyrecord.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070316/ENT09/703160315/1091/ENT |title=Insults still flying from legendary Don Rickles |author=Darrow, Chuck |publisher=''[[Daily Record (Morristown)|The Daily Record]]'' |date=March 16, 2007 |access-date=May 17, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130102091810/http://www.dailyrecord.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20070316%2FENT09%2F703160315%2F1091%2FENT&amp;nclick_check=1 |archivedate=January 2, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, he appeared in the second season of ''[[Tales from the Crypt (TV series)|Tales from the Crypt]]'' in "The Ventriloquist's Dummy." In 1992, he was cast in ''[[Innocent Blood (film)|Innocent Blood]]'', directed by [[John Landis]]. In his memoir, Rickles wrote that he recalled that Landis was a "Production Assistant" to [[Brian G. Hutton]] during the filming of ''[[Kelly's Heroes]]''. During the filming of ''Innocent Blood'', Rickles would kid Landis by ordering him to get coffee or to run other errands befitting his one-time "[[gofer]]" status.

In 1993, Rickles starred in another short-lived sitcom ''[[Daddy Dearest]]'', with [[Richard Lewis (comedian)|Richard Lewis]].

Rickles made a [[cameo appearance]] as himself in a recurring [[dream sequence]] in "[[Sub Conscious (The Unit)|Sub Conscious]]," an episode of ''[[The Unit]]'', which aired in February 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=TV.com |url=http://www.tv.com/the-unit/sub-conscious/episode/963722/summary.html |title=The Unit – Season 2, Episode 13: Sub Conscious |publisher=TV.com |date= |access-date=May 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A memoir titled ''Rickles' Book'' was released on May 8, 2007 by [[Simon &amp; Schuster]].

Rickles won a [[Primetime Emmy Award]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program|Outstanding Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program]], besting a number of notable comics, including [[David Letterman]], [[Jon Stewart]], and [[Stephen Colbert]]. Rickles remarked, "Stephen Colbert's a funny man, but he's too young. He has got plenty of time to win awards, but this may be my last year and I think that I made it count. On second thought it was probably just a mercy award for an old man."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goldderby.latimes.com/awards_goldderby/the_colbert_report/ |title=Gold Derby |publisher=Goldderby.latimes.com |date= |access-date=May 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rickles reprised his role of Mr. Potato Head for the [[Toy Story Midway Mania!]] attraction at [[Disney California Adventure Park]], [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]]&lt;ref name="ToyStoryMania"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/10/business/media/10ride.html|title=Will Disney Keep Us Amused?|author=Barnes, Brooke|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|date=February 10, 2008|access-date=March 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 2010 film ''[[Toy Story 3]]''.

In 2011, Rickles reunited with his ''Casino'' co-star [[Joe Pesci]] in a [[Snickers]] advertisement highlighting the actors known for their "short fuses."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theadbuzz.com/2011/05/joe-pesci-and-don-rickles-join-the-snickers |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120720151251/http://theadbuzz.com/2011/05/joe-pesci-and-don-rickles-join-the-snickers |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 20, 2012 |title=Joe Pesci and Don Rickles Join the Snickers "Party" |publisher=The Ad Buzz |date=May 18, 2011 |access-date=May 11, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rickles also portrayed the late husband of Elka ([[Betty White]]) on ''[[Hot in Cleveland]]''— a "surprise" because his character was thought to be dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/tv-blog/index.ssf/2011/08/don_rickles_shows_up_as_elkas_husband_in_hot_in_cleveland_season_finale.html|title=Don Rickles shows up as Elka's husband in 'Hot in Cleveland' season finale|publisher=|access-date=April 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 28, 2014, Rickles was honored by [[Spike TV]]'s "One Night Only: An All-Star Comedy Tribute to Don Rickles". Recorded live at New York City's [[Apollo Theater]], [[Jerry Seinfeld]] was the master of ceremonies for the two-hour special, with live monologues by [[Johnny Depp]], [[Martin Scorsese]], [[Robert De Niro]], [[Jon Stewart]], [[David Letterman]], [[Tracy Morgan]], [[Brian Williams]], [[Regis Philbin]], [[Amy Poehler]], and [[Tina Fey]]. Recorded segments included bits from [[Bob Newhart]], [[Bill Cosby]], [[Jimmy Kimmel]], and [[Eddie Murphy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/rickles-trades-shots-best-spike-salute-article-1.1803561 |title=Don Rickles and guest-star roasters like Jerry Seinfeld, David Letterman, Amy Poehler and Tina Fey trade shots |author=Kaplan, Don |date=May 27, 2014 |access-date=October 20, 2016 |work=[[New York Daily News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"The camaraderie and the comedy made the show a cross between a traditional roast and a dignified lifetime achievement award, spanning emotions ranging from admiration and gratitude to, well, degradation. And as the evening reached its climax, when Rickles got his say after all that had said about him and his nearly 60-year-long career, fittingly, he had the last laugh." – TV Week&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.tvweek.com/blogs/2014/05/spike-tvs-all-star-don-rickles-tribute-turning-up-the-heat-on-mr-warmth.php |title=Spike TV’s All-Star Don Rickles Tribute: Turning Up the Heat on ‘Mr. Warmth’ |publisher=TVWeek.com |date= |access-date=May 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He was still a frequent guest on [[late night talk show]]s, including ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'', ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon]]'', among other late night shows during the later months of his life. On May 11, 2015, Rickles appeared as a guest on one of the final episodes of ''The Late Show with David Letterman''.

In a 2014 interview, Rickles dismissed thoughts of retiring, saying: "I'm in good health. I'm working better than I ever have. The audiences are great. Why should I retire? I'm like a fighter. The bell rings and you come out and fight. My energy comes alive. And I still enjoy it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.turlockjournal.com/archives/25588/ |title=Comedy legend Don Rickles heads into Turlock |author=Stafford, Sabra |date=May 8, 2014 |access-date=October 20, 2016 |work=[[Turlock Journal]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until his death in 2017, despite being impeded by multiple surgeries following a bout with [[necrotizing fasciitis]] in 2013, Rickles continued touring across the United States.&lt;ref name="Post"/&gt;

==Personal life==
On March 14, 1965, Rickles married Barbara Sklar of [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]. He admitted having a very difficult time romantically in his 20s and 30s, finally meeting Sklar through his agent when he was 38 years old and falling for her when she failed to get his sense of humor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mensjournal.com/magazine/don-rickles-survival-skills-20130826|title=Don Rickles's Life Advice|work=Men's Journal|access-date=April 6, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170407025311/http://www.mensjournal.com/magazine/don-rickles-survival-skills-20130826|archive-date=April 7, 2017|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.milwaukeemag.com/don-rickles-exclusive-interview/|title=Don Rickles Exclusive Interview|first=Jimmy|last=McDonough|date=August 9, 2016|work=Milwaukee Magazine|access-date=April 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had two children, Mindy and [[Larry Rickles]].&lt;ref name=thr&gt;{{cite news|first=Mike|last=Barnes |title=Don Rickles’ Only Son Dies at 41, Larry Rickles earned an Emmy Award for a 2007 documentary about his dad |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/don-rickles-son-dies-at-270157 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |publisher= |date=December 6, 2011 |access-date=December 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Rickles' memoir, his grandchildren Ethan and Harrison Mann are much more impressed by his role as [[Mr. Potato Head (Toy Story)|Mr. Potato Head]] than by any of his other achievements.

He befriended mobster "Crazy" [[Joe Gallo]] following a performance at the [[Copacabana (nightclub)|Copacabana]] in 1972. Gallo, whom Rickles had ribbed mercilessly during his set despite being warned not to do so, accepted Rickles's ribbings in good humor and invited him to [[Umberto's Clam House]] after the show. Rickles declined the offer. That night, a gunfight erupted at Umberto's, killing Gallo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Don|last=Paul|url=http://buffalonews.com/2017/06/28/from-thugs-to-thunderstorms-the-don-paul-story/|title=From Thugs to Thunderstorms: the Don Paul story|newspaper=The Buffalo News|date=June 28, 2017|accessdate=June 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He considered comedian [[Bob Newhart]] to be his best friend, and their wives were also close friends.&lt;ref name=huffpo&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/04/aarp-convention-2013_n_3383576.html |title=AARP Convention 2013 Brings Don Rickles And Bob Newhart Together For The First Time |date=June 4, 2013 |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |access-date=October 20, 2016 |author=Emling, Shelley}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rickles and Newhart appeared together on ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'' on January 24, 2005, the Monday following [[Johnny Carson]]'s death, reminiscing about their many guest appearances on Carson's show. The two also appeared together on the television sitcom ''[[Newhart]]'' and for previous episodes of ''The Tonight Show'', where Newhart or Rickles were guest-hosts. They and their wives often vacationed together.&lt;ref name=huffpo/&gt;

==Death==

===Tributes===
Upon hearing of his death, a number of television hosts and other actors paid tribute to his comedy talents. Among them was a tribute by [[Jimmy Kimmel]], who recalled Rickles as a "towering presence in Las Vegas," where Kimmel grew up.&lt;ref&gt;[https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/jimmy-kimmel-don-rickles-1202026072/ "Jimmy Kimmel Pays Tribute to Don Rickles: ‘I’m Going to Cry’"], ''Variety'', April 6, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; [[Seth Meyers]], said "there's nothing better than getting burned by Don Rickles",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/late-night-hosts-remember-funny-sharp-generous-don-rickles-991896 "Late-Night Hosts Remember the "Funny, Sharp and Generous" Don Rickles"], ''The Hollywood Reporter'', April 6, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; while [[David Letterman]] noted that Rickles "was always a highlight for me. Just endless mischief and nonsense, and a guy who would make the audience go completely crazy."&lt;ref&gt;[http://people.com/movies/don-rickles-dead-david-letterman-remembers-late-comedian/ "David Letterman Remembers Late Comedian Don Rickles: ‘Endless Mischief and Nonsense"], ''People'' magazine, April 6, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The Newharts said in a statement, "We are devastated, and our world will never be the same. We were totally unprepared for this."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/don-rickles-dead-hollywood-pays-tribute-991739] ''The Hollywood Reporter'', April 6, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Lasseter]], one of the filmmakers of the ''Toy Story'' films, gave a heartfelt tweet to Rickles on [[Twitter]].

[[Martin Scorsese]], who directed him in ''[[Casino (1995 film)|Casino]]'' in 1995, stated:
{{quote|Don Rickles was a giant, a legend … and I can hear his voice now, skewering me for being so lofty. I had the honor of working with him on my picture ''Casino''. He was a professional. He kept me doubled over with laughter every day on the set—yet he was a complete pro.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ew.com/movies/2017/04/06/martin-scorsese-don-rickles-tribute/ "Martin Scorsese pays tribute to Don Rickles: 'He made comedy into an art form'"], ''Entertainment Weekly'', April 6, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For Rickles' 88th birthday in 2014, a number of stars helped celebrate it with a televised special titled ''One Night Only: An All Star Tribute to Don Rickles''.&lt;ref name=comics&gt;[http://thecomicscomic.com/2014/05/28/highlights-from-one-night-only-an-all-star-tribute-to-don-rickles-for-his-88th-birthday/ "Highlights from One Night Only: An All-Star Tribute to Don Rickles"], The Comic's Comic, May 28, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Among them was [[Jerry Seinfeld]], who described Rickles as part of "the Mount Rushmore of stand-up comedy."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7d4NbW5hoY "Jerry Seinfeld tribute to Don Rickles"],  for his 88th birthday&lt;/ref&gt;
