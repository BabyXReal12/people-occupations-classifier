'''Edward Everett Horton Jr.''' (March 18, 1886 &amp;ndash; September 29, 1970) was an American [[character actor]].&lt;ref name="obit"&gt;{{cite news| title=Horton's House Grew with Film Career|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997-04-12/local/me-48062_1_film-career|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=April 12, 1997|last=Fowler|first=James|accessdate=2013-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had a long career in film, theater, radio, television, and voice work for animated cartoons.

==Early life==
Horton was born in [[Brooklyn, New York]] (then an independent city), to Edward Everett Horton, a compositor for ''[[The New York Times]]'', and his wife Isabella S. (Diack) Horton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1873&amp;dat=19701001&amp;id=0U4fAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ndEEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=542,20671|title=Actor Edward Everett Horton Dies at 84|newspaper=Dayton Beach Morning Journal|date=October 1, 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father had [[English people|English]] and [[German people|German]] ancestry, while his mother was born in [[Matanzas]], [[Cuba]] to George and Mary (Orr) Diack, natives of [[Scotland]].&lt;ref name="genealogy"&gt;{{cite web|title=Edward Everett Horton, Jr.|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~battle/celeb/horton.htm| publisher=[[Ancestry.com]]|accessdate=2013-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[Boys and Girls High School|Boys' High School, Brooklyn]], and [[Baltimore City College]], where he was later inducted into their Hall of Fame.&lt;ref name="bernstein"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bernstein|first=Neil| year=2008|title=Notable City College Knights|publisher=Baltimore City College Alumni Association|location=Baltimore, MD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He began his college career at [[Oberlin College]] in [[Ohio]]. However, he was asked to leave after  he climbed to the top of a building and, after a crowd gathered, threw off a dummy, making them think he had jumped. He then attended [[Brooklyn Polytechnic]], followed by [[Columbia University]], where he was a member of [[Phi Kappa Psi]].&lt;ref name="keehn"&gt;{{Cite book

==Stage and film career==
Horton began his stage career in 1906, singing and dancing and playing small parts in [[vaudeville]] and in [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] productions. In 1919, he moved to [[Los Angeles, California]], where he began acting in [[Hollywood]] films. His first starring role was in the comedy ''Too Much Business'' (1922), but he portrayed the lead role of an idealistic young classical composer in the drama ''[[Beggar on Horseback]]'' (1925). In the late 1920s, he starred in two-reel silent comedies for [[Educational Pictures]], and made the transition to talking pictures with Educational in 1929. As a stage-trained performer, he found more film work easily, and appeared in some of [[Warner Bros.]]' early talkies, including ''[[The Terror (1928 film)|The Terror]]'' (1928) and ''[[Sonny Boy (1929 film)|Sonny Boy]]'' (1929).

Horton initially used his given name, Edward Horton, professionally. His father persuaded him to adopt his full name professionally, reasoning that other actors might be named Edward Horton, but only one named Edward Everett Horton.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} Horton soon cultivated his own special variation of the time-honored [[wikt:double take|double take]] (an actor's reaction to something, followed by a delayed, more extreme reaction). In Horton's version, he would smile ingratiatingly and nod in agreement with what just happened; then, when realization set in, his facial features collapsed entirely into a sober, troubled mask. {{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Horton starred in many comedy features in the 1930s, usually playing a mousy fellow who put up with domestic or professional problems to a certain point, and then finally asserted himself for a happy ending. He is best known, however, for his work as a [[character actor]] in supporting roles. These include ''[[The Front Page (1931 film)|The Front Page]]'' (1931), ''[[Trouble in Paradise (film)|Trouble in Paradise]]'' (1932), ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1933 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'' (1933), ''[[The Gay Divorcee]]'' (1934, the first of several [[Fred Astaire|Astaire]]/[[Ginger Rogers|Rogers]] films in which Horton appeared), ''[[Top Hat]]'' (1935), ''[[Danger - Love at Work]]'' (1937), ''[[Lost Horizon (1937 film)|Lost Horizon]]'' (1937), ''[[Holiday (1938 film)|Holiday]]'' (1938), ''[[Here Comes Mr. Jordan]]'' (1941), ''[[Arsenic and Old Lace (film)|Arsenic and Old Lace]]'' (1944), ''[[Pocketful of Miracles]]'' (1961), ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' (1963), and ''[[Sex and the Single Girl (film)|Sex and the Single Girl]]'' (1964). His last role was in the comedy film ''[[Cold Turkey (film)|Cold Turkey]]'' (1971), in which his character communicated only through facial expressions.

Horton continued to appear in stage productions, often in summer stock. His performance in the play ''[[Springtime for Henry]]'' became a perennial in summer theaters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Edward Everett Horton – Biography of the Beloved Character Actor|url=http://www.things-and-other-stuff.com/15135/edward-everett-horton|last=Aliperti|first=Cliff|date=December 7, 2011|publisher=Immortal Ephemera|accessdate=2013-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Radio and television==
From 1945-47, Horton hosted radio's ''[[Kraft Music Hall]]''. An early television appearance came in the play ''[[Sham (play)|Sham]]'', shown on ''[[The Chevrolet Tele-Theatre]]'' on 13 December 1948. During the 1950s, Horton worked in television. One of his best-remembered appearances is in an episode of [[CBS]]'s ''[[I Love Lucy]]'', in which he is cast against type as a frisky, amorous suitor, broadcast in 1952. In 1960, he guest-starred on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s [[sitcom]] ''[[The Real McCoys]]'' as J. Luther Medwick, grandfather of the boyfriend of series character Hassie McCoy ([[Lydia Reed]]). In the story line, Medwick clashes with the equally outspoken Grandpa Amos McCoy (played by [[Walter Brennan]]).

He remains, however, best known to the Baby Boomer generation as the venerable narrator of ''[[Fractured Fairy Tales]]'' in ''[[The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show]]'' (1959–61),&lt;ref name="desowitz"&gt;{{cite news|title=Something 'Fractured,' Something New|date=August 27, 1999|last=Desowitz|first=Bill|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/aug/27/entertainment/ca-4025| accessdate=2013-09-06| work=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; an American animated television series that originally aired from November 19, 1959, to June 27, 1964, on the ABC and NBC television networks.

In 1962, he portrayed the character Uncle Ned in three episodes of the [[CBS]] [[television series]] ''[[Dennis the Menace (1959 TV series)|Dennis the Menace]]''. In 1965, he played the medicine man, Roaring Chicken, in the ABC sitcom ''[[F Troop]]''. He echoed this role, portraying Chief Screaming Chicken, on ABC's ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' as a pawn to [[Vincent Price]]'s [[Egghead (Batman)|Egghead]] in the villain's attempt to take control of [[Gotham City]].

==Death and legacy==
Horton died of cancer at age 84 in [[Encino, California]]. His remains were interred in Glendale's Whispering Pines section of [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Glendale|Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Scott. ''Resting Places: The Burial Sites of More Than 14,000 Famous Persons'', 3d ed.: 2 (Kindle Location 22166). McFarland &amp; Company, Inc., Publishers. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

Actor [[Gavin Gordon (actor)|Gavin Gordon]], 15 years Horton's junior, appears in the 1961 film ''[[Pocketful of Miracles]]'' that also features Horton, though they do not appear together in any scenes.  They did appear together in at least one play, a 1931 production of [[Noël Coward]]'s ''[[Private Lives]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Stars and Talkies of Hollywood |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1314&amp;dat=19311027&amp;id=mRpWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=FuMDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6980,3169933&amp;hl=en |newspaper=[[The Spokesman-Review]] |date=October 27, 1931 |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1925, Horton purchased several acres in the district of [[Encino, Los Angeles|Encino]] and lived on the property at 5521 Amestoy Avenue until his death. He named the estate, which contained Horton's own house and houses for his brother, his sister and their respective families, Belleigh Acres.&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt; In the 1950s, the state of California forced Horton to sell a portion of his property for construction of the [[Ventura Freeway]]. The freeway construction left a short stump of Amestoy Avenue south of Burbank Boulevard and shortly after his death, the city of [[Los Angeles]] renamed that portion Edward Everett Horton Lane.&lt;ref name="sfvb"&gt;{{cite web|title=Edward Everett Horton's Encino Ranch Estate and the 101 Freeway; How A Celebrity Lost His Ranch to Suburbanization| url=http://sanfernandovalleyblog.blogspot.com/2012/04/bttf12-edward-everett-hortons-encino.html| publisher=San Fernando Valley Blog| date=4 April 2012| accessdate=2013-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Edward Everett Horton Lane ends at Burbank Boulevard, and begins in the shadow of the Ventura Freeway.  On the other side of the boulevard is a bus stop also named for Edward Everett Horton, between bus stops at Aldea and Balboa. The borderline of [[Sepulveda Dam#Sepulveda Basin Recreation Area|Anthony C. Beilenson Park]] is directly across the street from the corner of Burbank Boulevard and EE Horton Lane. The opposite end of the lane leads to a foot bridge that overlooks the Ventura Freeway and ends up on the Amestoy Avenue side.{{Citation needed|date = March 2018}}

British Radio DJ and Comedian [[Kenny Everett]] adopted the name of Everett in honor of Horton who was a childhood hero of his. (Kenny's real name was Maurice Cole){{Citation needed|date = March 2018}}

For his contribution to the motion picture industry, Horton has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6427 [[Hollywood Boulevard]].{{Citation needed|date = March 2018}}
