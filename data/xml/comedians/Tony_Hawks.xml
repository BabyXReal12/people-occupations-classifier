'''Antony Gordon Hawksworth''', [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] (born 12 May 1960), known professionally as '''Tony Hawks''', is a British comedian and author.

==Early life==
Born in [[Brighton]], [[East Sussex]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.findmypast.co.uk/results/world-records/england-and-wales-births-1837-2006?firstname=antony%20g&amp;20g&amp;lastname=hawksworth&amp;eventyear=1960&amp;eventyear_offset=0&amp;district=brighton&amp;county=sussex|website=Findmypast.co.uk|title=Tony Hawks}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hawks was educated at Brighton Hove and Sussex Grammar School (1971–76) (which became [[Brighton Hove &amp; Sussex Sixth Form College]] in 1975) and [[Brighton College]] (1976–78).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldbrightonians.com/hall-of-fame/film-tv/tony-hawks.html |title=Tony Hawks (A. 1976-78) &amp;#124; Old Brightonians - The Alumni of Brighton College |publisher=Old Brightonians |date=2006-01-14 |accessdate=2012-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated during an appearance on ''[[I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue]]'' that he had briefly attended the [[University of Manchester]].

==Career==
After leaving a drama degree at Manchester University prematurely&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/life/books/tony-hawks-i-wanted-to-be-closer-to-nature-so-i-moved-to-the-country-31100547.html|title=Tony Hawks: 'I wanted to be closer to nature... so I moved to the country' - BelfastTelegraph.co.uk|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Hawks appeared in the West End musical Lennon - A Musical Biography at [[London Astoria|The Astoria]].&lt;ref&gt;[Round Ireland with a Fridge {{ISBN|0-09-186777-0}}]&lt;/ref&gt; By 1988, before he found chart success, he was already appearing in BBC Radio 4's ''Big Fun Show'' with Paul Merton, John Irwin and Josie Lawrence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epguides.com/BigFunShow/|title=The Big Fun Show (a Titles and Air Dates Guide)|website=epguides.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hawks first attempted to break into show business as a [[singer-songwriter]], but it was with a novelty record that he had his first brush with fame. As leader of the trio [[Morris Minor and the Majors]], he reached number 4 in the [[UK Singles Chart]] with the [[Beastie Boys]] parody, "[[Stutter Rap (No Sleep til Bedtime)]]" in 1988.&lt;ref name="British Hit Singles &amp; Albums"&gt;{{cite book

A TV series followed from this, ''Morris Minor's Marvellous Motors'', written by and starring Hawks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/morris_minors_marvellous_motors/cast_crew/|title=Morris Minor's Marvellous Motors cast and crew credits - British Comedy Guide|first=British Comedy|last=Guide|website=British Comedy Guide}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it the fictional bandleader attempted to maintain his pop career while running a garage. It ran for one series in 1989.

Hawks performs stand-up comedy, and is a regular on TV and radio panel games in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], including ''[[I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue]]'', ''[[Just a Minute]]'', ''[[The Unbelievable Truth (radio show)|The Unbelievable Truth]]'' and ''[[Have I Got News for You]]'', although he first came to prominence as one of two resident performers — the other was [[Jo Brand]] — on semi-successful BBC monologue show ''[[The Brain Drain]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukgameshows.com/ukgs/The_Brain_Drain|title=The Brain Drain - UKGameshows|website=www.ukgameshows.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has also appeared in ''[[Red Dwarf]]'' in a number of supporting roles, on several occasions as a voice artist for intelligent machines. Hawks provided the voice of a vending machine in "[[Future Echoes]]" and "[[Waiting for God (Red Dwarf)|Waiting for God]]" and the voice of a suitcase in "[[Stasis Leak]]", and appeared on screen as The Guide in "[[Better Than Life (Red Dwarf)|Better Than Life]]", The Compere in "[[Backwards (Red Dwarf episode)|Backwards]]", and [[Caligula]] in "[[Meltdown (Red Dwarf)|Meltdown]]".  On 29 May 2009, Hawks featured in an episode of "[[Carpool (web series)|Carpool]]", with his Red Dwarf co-star [[Robert Llewellyn]].

He also provided the voice-over for a restaurant advertisement in the episode "[[Me²]]", although this role was uncredited. In the first few seasons of ''Red Dwarf'', Hawks performed a warm-up act for the live audience before taping began. He has appeared as a [[Pundit (expert)|pundit]] the television series ''[[Grumpy Old Men (TV series)|Grumpy Old Men]]'' and as a contestant on the BBC quiz show ''[[School's Out (TV series)|School's Out]]''.

In November 2010, he was a guest on a number of TV and radio programmes to discuss the film version of ''Round Ireland with a Fridge'', including [[Simon Mayo]]'s [[BBC Radio 2]] show, "Loose Ends", [[BBC Radio Wales]] and [[BBC Radio Scotland]]. He was also a contestant on a special edition of ''[[Mastermind (TV series)|Mastermind]]'' for Children in Need; featured as part of Comic Relief 2011.

In March 2011, he travelled to Japan to appear at the [[Okinawa International Movie Festival]] where ''Round Ireland with a Fridge'' was nominated for Best Comedy. In late 2011, Hawks completed his first national theatre tour for a decade, taking his one-man show, 'Random Fun' to 30 towns and cities around the UK. He was also a guest on many television and radio shows during the tour including ''[[BBC Breakfast]]'' and ''[[The Wright Stuff]]''.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

In August 2013, he, as well as many other comedians appeared in the television adaptation of the Radio show ''[[Just a Minute]]'' for the 45th anniversary of the show.

==Books==
Hawks has written six books:
* ''Round Ireland with a Fridge'': His first book was an account of his attempt to hitchhike around [[Ireland]] with a [[refrigerator|fridge]] to win a [[bar bet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hawks|first1=Tony|title=Round Ireland with a Fridge|date=2007|publisher=Ebury Press|location=London|isbn=0-09-186777-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; It sold over 800,000 copies.
* ''Playing the Moldovans at Tennis'': His second book, also the result of a drunken bet (with the comedian [[Arthur Smith (comedian)|Arthur Smith]]), this time involved an attempt to beat each member of the [[Moldova national football team]] in a game of [[tennis]], based on the theory that people good at one sport aren't necessarily good at others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hawks|first1=Tony|title=Playing the Moldovans at Tennis|date=2001|publisher=Ebury Press|location=London|isbn=0-09-187456-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''One Hit Wonderland'': His third book, describes his attempt, over 10 years after his first, to write a second hit song. This culminates in him performing on [[Albania]]n television with [[Norman Wisdom]] and [[Tim Rice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hawks|first1=Tony|title=One Hit Wonderland|date=2003|publisher=Ebury Press|location=London|isbn=0-09-188210-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''A Piano in the Pyrenees: The Ups and Downs of an Englishman in the French Mountains'': An account of his purchase of a house in the [[Pyrenees]] in the south of France, after deciding that the two things he wanted in life were to meet his [[soul mate]], and to purchase an "idyllic house abroad somewhere abroad".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hawks|first1=Tony|title=A Piano in the Pyrenees|date=2006|publisher=Ebury|location=London|isbn=0-09-190267-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tony Hawks |url=http://www.shvoong.com/books/travel-book-log/496104-piano-pyrenees/ |title=A Piano in the Pyrenees |publisher=Shvoong.com |date=2007-03-26 |accessdate=2012-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences==
Hawks chose ''[[The Power of Now]]'' by [[Eckhart Tolle]] as the book he would take with him to a desert island.&lt;ref name=Hawks&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/books/article-1329080/TONY-HAWKS-What-Book-.html?ito=feeds-newsxml |title=TONY HAWKS: What Book...? |author= |date=2010-11-12 |work= |publisher=Daily Mail |accessdate=25 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was the first British feature film to be made in Moldova, with additional filming in London, Belfast and Israel and it premiered with a special charity screening at the Odeon West End in Leicester Square on 21 June 2012

==Theatre==
Hawks staged a special charity performance of his comedy musical 'Midlife Cowboy' at the Lyric Theatre in London on 25 April 2016.

==Other activities==

Hawks donated half of the royalties from his book ''Playing the Moldovans at Tennis'' to a trust fund for Moldova,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tony-hawks.com/philanthropy.php |title=Tony Hawks |publisher=Tony-hawks.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130126143207/http://www.tony-hawks.com/philanthropy.php |archivedate=26 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was used to open the [[Hippocrates Centre]], a medical centre that provides rehabilitative therapy for disabled children from socially vulnerable families. Hawks continues to support Hippocrates through fundraising and personal involvement and was appointed a [[Member of the Order of the British Empire]] (MBE) in the [[2017 Birthday Honours]] "for services to disadvantaged children in Moldova".&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=61962|supp=y|page=B24|date=17 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-40300916|title=In pictures: Entertainment and arts honours|date=16 June 2017|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proceeds from the film version of Playing the Moldovans at Tennis also go to the Care Home.

Hawks is the co-founder and public face of the 'Tennis for Free' campaign which aims to make Britain's existing municipal tennis facilities available to all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tennisforfree.com/trustees.php|title=Tennis for Free|publisher=Tennisforfree.com|accessdate=2012-12-18|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522071808/http://www.tennisforfree.com/trustees.php|archivedate=22 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He won the British Actors Equity Tennis Tournament for three years running.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Hawks is currently{{when|date=February 2013}} collaborating with [[Chesney Hawkes]] on various songs available from a [[MySpace]] website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tony-hawks.com/music.php | title=Music | work=Tony Hawks official website | accessdate=7 June 2014 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140929135113/http://www.tony-hawks.com/music.php | archivedate=29 September 2014 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is frequently confused with pro-skateboarder [[Tony Hawk]], largely because the latter's video game franchise uses the possessive [[apostrophe]] ("Tony Hawk's"). Hawks maintains a list of emails intended for the skateboarder and his mischievous responses to them, on his website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.tony-hawks.com/skateboarding |title= Tony Hawks |publisher=Tony-hawks.com |date= |accessdate=4 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 January 2008, he appeared on an edition of ''[[Mastermind (TV series)|Celebrity Mastermind]]'', with Tony Hawk as his chosen specialist subject.&lt;ref&gt;''Radio Times'' 22 December 2007 – 4 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Hawks noted that his correspondents "might be able to do backside varials but they can't spell to save their lives".&lt;ref&gt;''Celebrity Mastermind'', [[BBC One]], 2 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
