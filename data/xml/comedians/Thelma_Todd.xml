'''Thelma Alice Todd'''&lt;ref name="Allmovie" /&gt; (July 29, 1906 – December 16, 1935)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; was an American actress. Appearing in about 120 pictures between 1926 and 1935, she is best remembered for her comedic roles in films such as [[Marx Brothers]]' ''[[Monkey Business (1931 film)|Monkey Business]]'', ''[[Horse Feathers]]'', and a number of [[Charley Chase]]'s short comedies and co-starring with [[Buster Keaton]] and [[Jimmy Durante]] in ''[[Speak Easily]]''. She also had roles in [[Wheeler and Woolsey]] farces and several [[Laurel and Hardy]] films, the last of which (''[[The Bohemian Girl (1936 film)|The Bohemian Girl]]'') featured her in a part that was truncated by her suspicious death at the age of 29.

==Early life==
Todd was born in [[Lawrence, Massachusetts]],&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://ic.galegroup.com/ic/bic1/BiographiesDetailsPage/BiographiesDetailsWindow?failOverType=&amp;query=&amp;prodId=BIC1&amp;windowstate=normal&amp;contentModules=&amp;display-query=&amp;mode=view&amp;displayGroupName=Biographies&amp;limiter=&amp;currPage=&amp;disableHighlighting=false&amp;displayGroups=&amp;sortBy=&amp;search_within_results=&amp;p=BIC1&amp;action=e&amp;catId=&amp;activityType=&amp;scanId=&amp;documentId=GALE%7CK1601058871&amp;source=Bookmark&amp;u=mlin_n_umass&amp;jsid=7054d3e219c3b34e65cb64a2cb20df73|title = Almanac of Famous People|date = 2011|accessdate = December 25, 2015|website = Biography in Context|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; to John Shaw Todd, an upholsterer from [[Ireland]],&lt;ref&gt;1910 United states Federal Census&lt;/ref&gt; and Alice Elizabeth Edwards, an immigrant from [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, "Pedigree Resource File," database,''FamilySearch''({{cite web |url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/2:2:3HT8-NY8 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-06-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180522194307/https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/2:2:3HT8-NY8 |archivedate=2018-05-22 |df= }} : accessed 2016-06-09), entry for Thelma Alice /Todd/.&lt;/ref&gt; She was a bright student who achieved good academic results. She intended to become a schoolteacher and enrolled at the Lowell Normal School (now [[University of Massachusetts Lowell|University of Massachusetts, Lowell]]) after graduating from high school in 1923.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = In remembrance Thelma Todd on her would-be 107th birthday|url = http://www.eagletribune.com/news/lifestyles/in-remembrance-thelma-todd-on-her-would-be-th-birthday/article_8dcb4f3f-f155-5bcb-a9b4-538b010e203e.html|website = Eagle-Tribune|accessdate = 2015-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in her late teens, she began entering [[beauty pageant]]s, winning the title of Miss Massachusetts in 1925.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; While representing her home state, she was spotted by a [[Hollywood]] talent scout and began her career in film at [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]]. She had an older brother, William.&lt;ref&gt;1910 United States Federal Census&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
[[File:Thelma Todd in Corsair 1.jpg|right|thumb|Todd as Alison Corning in ''[[Corsair (film)|Corsair]]'' (1931)]]

During the [[silent film]] era, Todd appeared in numerous supporting roles that made full use of her beauty but gave her little chance to act. With the advent of the talkies, Todd was given opportunity to expand her roles when producer [[Hal Roach]] signed her to appear with such comedy stars as [[Harry Langdon]], [[Charley Chase]], and [[Laurel and Hardy]].

In 1931, Roach cast Todd in her own series of slapstick comedy shorts, running 17 to 27 minutes each. In an attempt to create a female version of Laurel and Hardy,  Roach teamed Todd with [[ZaSu Pitts]] (pronounced "say-zoo," also her character's name) for 17 shorts, from "Let's do Things" (June 1931) through "One Track Minds" (May 1933). When Pitts left in 1933, she was replaced by [[Patsy Kelly]], appearing with Todd in 21 shorts, from "Beauty and the Bus" (September 1933) through "An All American Toothache" (January 1936). These Roach shorts often cast Todd as a working girl having all sorts of problems and trying her best to remain poised and charming despite the embarrassing antics of her sidekick.

In 1931, Todd starred in ''[[Corsair (film)|Corsair]]'', a film directed by [[Roland West]], with whom she would later become romantically involved. &lt;ref name="Allmovie"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/artist/p71178|first=Hal|last=Erickson|title=Thelma Todd|work=Allmovie.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222125855/http://www.allmovie.com/artist/p71178|archivedate=2015-12-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title =Joyita: Solving the Mystery|first=David|last=Wright|publisher=Auckland University Press|year=2002|isbn=1-86940-270-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Td3_d9o81QMC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=Jewel+Carmen|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Todd became highly regarded as a capable film comedian, and Roach loaned her out to other studios to play opposite [[Wheeler &amp; Woolsey]], [[Buster Keaton]], [[Joe E. Brown (comedian)|Joe E. Brown]], and the [[Marx Brothers]]. She also appeared successfully in such dramas as the original 1931 film version of ''[[The Maltese Falcon (1931 film)|The Maltese Falcon]]'' starring [[Ricardo Cortez]] as [[Sam Spade]], in which she played Miles Archer's treacherous widow. During her career she appeared in 119 films, although many of these were short films, and was sometimes publicized as "The Ice Cream Blonde."

In August, 1934, Todd opened a successful cafe, Thelma Todd's Sidewalk Cafe, at 17575 Pacific Coast Highway in the Los Angeles coastal neighborhood of [[Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles|Pacific Palisades]]. It attracted a diverse clientele of Hollywood celebrities as well as many tourists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wallace|first=David |author2=Miller, Ann |title=Hollywoodland|publisher=Macmillan|year=2003|pages=21|isbn=0-312-31614-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://benny-drinnon.blogspot.com/2014/01/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-12-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171208175028/http://benny-drinnon.blogspot.com/2014/01/ |archivedate=2017-12-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hollywoodhistoricphotos.com/product_info.php/products_id/5832 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-12-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171208175136/http://hollywoodhistoricphotos.com/product_info.php/products_id/5832 |archivedate=2017-12-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hollywoodhistoricphotos.com/product_info.php/products_id/5833 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-12-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171208174939/http://hollywoodhistoricphotos.com/product_info.php/products_id/5833 |archivedate=2017-12-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Todd continued her short-subject series through 1935 and was featured in the full-length Laurel and Hardy comedy ''The Bohemian Girl''. This was her last film; she died after completing all of her scenes, but most of them were re-shot. Producer Roach deleted all of Todd's dialogue and limited her appearance to one musical number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Louvish|first=Simon |title=Stan and Ollie, The Roots of Comedy: The Double Life of Laurel and Hardy|publisher=Macmillan|year=2002|pages=339|isbn=0-312-26651-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
[[File:Speak Easily (1932) 1.jpg|right|thumb|[[Buster Keaton]], Thelma Todd and [[Jimmy Durante]] in ''[[Speak Easily]]'' (1932)]]

On the morning of December 16, 1935, Thelma Todd was found dead in her car inside the garage of [[Jewel Carmen]], a former actress and former wife of Todd's lover and business partner, [[Roland West]]. Carmen's house was approximately a block from the topmost side of Todd's restaurant.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=LQsB66qPGmgC&amp;pg=PA233&amp;lpg=PA233&amp;dq=Roland&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.palipost.com/property-that-housed-thelma-todds-sidewalk-cafe-sold-for-6-million-exclusive-look-inside/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-12-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171209043950/https://www.palipost.com/property-that-housed-thelma-todds-sidewalk-cafe-sold-for-6-million-exclusive-look-inside/ |archivedate=2017-12-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iamnotastalker.com/2008/10/27/thelma-todds-sidewalk-cafe/&lt;/ref&gt; Her death was determined to have been caused by [[carbon monoxide poisoning]]. West is quoted in a contemporaneous newspaper account&lt;ref name="Thelma Todd Feared Gangs"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Thelma Todd Feared Gangs|journal=The Milwaukee Journal|date=Dec 18, 1935|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gKBQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=PSIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6744%2C3320913|accessdate=10 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as having locked her out, which may have caused her to seek refuge and warmth in the car. Todd had a wide circle of friends and associates as well as a busy social life.

Police investigations revealed that she had spent the previous Saturday night (December 14) at the [[Trocadero (Los Angeles)|Trocadero]], a popular Hollywood restaurant, at a party hosted by entertainer [[Stanley Lupino]] and his actress daughter, [[Ida Lupino|Ida]]. At the restaurant, she had had a brief but unpleasant exchange with her ex-husband, [[Pat DiCicco]]. However, her friends stated that she was in good spirits and were aware of nothing unusual in her life that could suggest a reason for her committing suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|S-hBdyM4v3o|Thelma Todd "Mysteries &amp; Scandals"}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was driven home from the party in the early hours of December 15 by her chauffeur, Ernest O. Peters.&lt;ref name="Thelma Todd Feared Gangs"/&gt;
[[File:Thelma Todd in Corsair 4.jpg|thumb|right|Thelma Todd, 1930]]
The detectives of the [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] concluded that Todd's death was accidental, the result of her either warming up the car to drive it or using the heater to keep herself warm. A Coroner's Inquest into Todd's death was held on December 18, 1935.&lt;ref&gt;Donati, William. ''The Life and Death of Thelma Todd''. McFarland &amp; Company, Inc., 2012, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; Autopsy surgeon A.P. Wagner testified that there were "no marks of violence anywhere upon or within the body" with only a "superficial contusion on the lower lip."&lt;ref&gt;Donati, William. ''The Life and Death of Thelma Todd''. McFarland &amp; Company, Inc., 2012, p. 368&lt;/ref&gt; There are informal accounts of greater signs of injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morgan|first1=Michelle|title=The Ice Cream Blonde: The Whirlwind Life and Mysterious Death of Screwball Comedienne Thelma Todd|date=November 1, 2015|publisher=Chicago Review Press|isbn=9781613730386|pages=211, 212}}&lt;/ref&gt; The jury ruled that the death appeared to be accidental but recommended "further investigation to be made into the case, by proper authorities." &lt;ref&gt;Donati, William. ''The Life and Death of Thelma Todd''. McFarland &amp; Company, Inc., 2012, p. 174&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently a grand jury probe was held to determine whether Todd's death was a murder. After four weeks of testimony, the inquiry was closed with no evidence of murder being brought forward.&lt;ref name="Donati, William 2012, p. 187"&gt;Donati, William. ''The Life and Death of Thelma Todd''. McFarland &amp; Company, Inc., 2012, p. 187&lt;/ref&gt; The case was closed by the Homicide Bureau, which listed the death as "accidental with possible suicide tendencies."  However, investigators were unable to find any motive for suicide or a suicide note.&lt;ref name="Donati, William 2012, p. 187"/&gt;

Visitation was held at [[Pierce Brothers]] Mortuary at 720 West Washington Blvd in [[Los Angeles]]

Todd's body was cremated. After her mother's death in 1969, Todd's remains were placed in her mother's casket and buried in [[Bellevue Cemetery]] in her hometown of [[Lawrence, Massachusetts]].

==Legacy==
For her contribution to the motion picture industry, Todd has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6262 Hollywood Blvd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thelma Todd|url=http://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/thelma-todd/|publisher=[[The Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=18 April 2014|date=17 December 1935|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150928220705/http://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/thelma-todd/ |archivedate=28 September 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
