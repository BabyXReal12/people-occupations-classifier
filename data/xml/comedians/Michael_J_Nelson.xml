Nelson was the head writer of the series for most of the show's eleven-year run, and spent half of that time as the on-air host, also named [[Mike Nelson (character)|Mike Nelson]]. In addition to writing books, Nelson is currently part of the online movie riffing sites [[RiffTrax]] and [[The Film Crew]] with fellow ''MST3K'' alumni, [[Bill Corbett]] and [[Kevin Murphy (actor)|Kevin Murphy]]. He has written articles for [[Cracked.com]].

==Career==

===''Mystery Science Theater 3000''===
Nelson was working as a waiter at [[T.G.I. Friday's]] and doing occasional stand-up comedy when he was offered a job on ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'', typing the suggestions in the writing room. The writers told him to feel free to make some comments on the movies they were watching, and Nelson impressed them so much with his wit and comedic timing that they made him a staff writer, and, later, head writer. Nelson also appeared frequently in the show's host segments, often playing characters from the movies being mocked such as Torgo from the infamous ''[[Manos - The Hands of Fate]]''.

When series originator and host [[Joel Hodgson]] decided to leave the show half-way through the fifth season, he chose Nelson as his replacement, reportedly because he thought Nelson was a natural leader, a gifted comedian, and a gifted muse, and also because Nelson simply looked good standing next to the show's puppets.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} Nelson remained in the host role for another five and a half seasons until the show's final Sci-Fi Channel episode aired in 1999.

===Post-''MST3K''===
Since the series ended, Nelson has worked steadily as a writer, publishing several books (as of March 2006): ''[[Mike Nelson's Movie Megacheese]]'', ''Mike Nelson's Mind Over Matters'' and ''[[Mike Nelson's Death Rat!]]'', the last being his first novel. His other works include a series of pop-culture humor books, ''Happy Kitty Bunny Pony'', ''Goth-Icky'', and ''Love Sick'', as well as a monthly column for ''Home Theater Magazine''. He also wrote for the short-lived game show ''[[Let's Bowl]]'', which gained a cult following of its own. He has commentary tracks for DVD releases of several films, including ''[[Reefer Madness]]'', ''[[The Little Shop of Horrors]]'', ''[[House on Haunted Hill]]'', ''[[Plan 9 from Outer Space]]'', ''[[Carnival of Souls]]'', and ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]''. With his ''MST3K'' co-stars [[Kevin Murphy (actor)|Kevin Murphy]] and [[Bill Corbett]], he was part of a comedy team called "[[The Film Crew]]", which has created comedy segments for [[National Public Radio]]. The first Film Crew DVD, ''[[Hollywood After Dark]]'', was released July 10, 2007, and three more followed in the months after.

In 2006, Nelson was appointed Chief Content Producer for [[Legend Films]]. He is responsible for building and leading the company's creative content, providing continuous commentaries, and developing other premium web-based programming. "I'm very excited. Legend Films is such a great fit for me—talented people who consistently put out a great product. Plus, there are Flaming Hot [[Cheetos]] in the lunch room [[vending machine]]. That made it an easy choice to join the team," enthused Nelson.&lt;ref name="Legend Films"&gt;{{cite web|last=Legend Films, Inc.|date=July 10, 2006|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&amp;STORY=/www/story/07-10-2006/0004393818&amp;EDATE|title=Michael J. Nelson Named Producer at Legend Films|work=PR Newswire|accessdate=January 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the projects put together by Nelson and Legend Films was [[RiffTrax]], a website offering the purchase of downloadable audio commentaries once again costarring two former MST3K cast members [[Kevin Murphy (actor)|Kevin Murphy]] and [[Bill Corbett]]. The first commentary made available through the service was for ''[[Road House (1989 film)|Road House]]''. In a September 2006 interview, Nelson said he felt that Rifftrax may be the closest thing to a reunion of the ''Mystery Science Theater 3000'' team.&lt;ref name="TheFlux.tv"&gt;{{cite web|last=The Flux.tv |date=September 28, 2006 |url=http://www.theflux.tv/index.php?/Podcast_Player/mike-nelson-of-mst3k-fame |title=Mike Nelson of MST3K Fame Stops In |work=TheFlux.tv |accessdate=January 3, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928195321/http://www.theflux.tv/index.php?%2FPodcast_Player%2Fmike-nelson-of-mst3k-fame |archivedate=September 28, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, additional MST3K alumni, [[Joel Hodgson]], [[Trace Beaulieu]], and [[Frank Conniff]], all appeared for a live reunion at the State Theatre in Minneapolis with Nelson, Murphy and Corbett. They were also joined by the newest host, [[Jonah Ray]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rifftrax.com/rifftrax-live-mst3k-reunion&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Nelson agreed to do voiceover work for ''[[Armikrog]]''.&lt;ref name="Kickstarter"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kickstarter|date=June 20, 2013|url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1949537745/armikrog/posts/515370|title=Q &amp; A with Michael J. Nelson|accessdate=June 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nelson voices the lead character, Tommynaut.&lt;ref name="ScrewAttack"&gt;{{cite web|last=ScrewAttack|date=June 19, 2013|url=http://www.screwattack.com/news/interview-bryan-speaks-doug-tennepal-about-his-upcoming-game-armikrog|title=Bryan the intern speaks with Doug TenNapel about his upcoming game, Armikrog|accessdate=June 20, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130622035048/http://www.screwattack.com/news/interview-bryan-speaks-doug-tennepal-about-his-upcoming-game-armikrog|archivedate=June 22, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Nelson is married to fellow ''MST3K'' writer [[Bridget Jones Nelson|Bridget Jones]], and the pair have two sons. They moved from the [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]], area to [[San Diego, California]], in mid-2006.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} Nelson and his family moved back to Minneapolis in 2014.

He has described the role of Christianity in his family as "the very centerpiece of our lives. We're heavily involved in our church, my wife works with youth groups and churches as her profession, and almost every career and life decision I make depends upon it."  He studies [[Christian apologetics]] and cites [[William Lane Craig]] and [[C.S. Lewis]] as influences.&lt;ref name="interview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://liheliso.com/Issue7/Issue7.html#Mike_Nelson|title=Interview with Lincoln Heights Literary Society|author=Mayerson, Ginger|author2=Sutton, Laurel|date=2005|publisher=Lincoln Heights Literary Society|website=Liheliso.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Politically, Nelson describes himself as a [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]]. He summed up his views during an interview on the MST3K fan site in 2004: "I read the ''[[National Review]]'' cover to cover. Check in at [[Townhall.com]] every day. Check the ''[[Washington Times]]'' daily. Listen to [[Dennis Prager]] and [[Michael Medved]] on a regular basis. Read [[Mark Steyn]] with regularity. Read the ''[[Weekly Standard]]''. So, yes, I do vote [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]."&lt;ref name="mst3kreview3"&gt;''MST3K'' Review article: [http://www.d1041111.dotsterhost.com/mst3k/special-events_interview_mike-nelson-2-main.html "An Interview With Mike Nelson 2"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090301050738/http://www.d1041111.dotsterhost.com/mst3k/special-events_interview_mike-nelson-2-main.html |date=March 1, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
