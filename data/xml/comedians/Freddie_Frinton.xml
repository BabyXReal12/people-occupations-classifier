'''Freddie Frinton''', born '''Frederick Bittiner Coo''',&lt;ref name="Name"&gt;According to the NDR, and the General Record Office (Births, Marriages, Deaths) Frinton's birth name was Coo. The [[The Internet Movie Database|IMDb]] gives his birth name as Bittener but this appears to have been a mistake.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GRO"&gt;General Register Office: Register of Births – Mar 1909 7a [5_]77 Grimsby – Frederick Bittiner Coo&lt;/ref&gt; (17 January 1909 – 16 October 1968)&lt;ref&gt;General Register Office: Register of Deaths – Dec 1968 5a 202 Brent, Frederick Frinton aged 54 (59?)&lt;/ref&gt; was an English [[comedian]] and music hall and television actor who remains a household name in Germany and Scandinavia because of his performance in ''[[Dinner for One]]''.

==Early life==
Frinton was born in Hainton Avenue, [[Grimsby]], [[Lincolnshire]], the illegitimate child of a [[seamstress]], Florence Elisabeth Coo, and was brought up by [[foster parent]]s. He started working in a Grimsby fish processing plant, where he is said to have entertained his colleagues with parodies and jokes, but was ultimately sacked. He moved into [[music hall]], where he enjoyed modest success and renamed himself Freddie Frinton.

==Career==
During the [[Second World War]] he made a moderate breakthrough as a comedian. In 1945, Frinton first performed the sketch ''Dinner for One'' in [[Blackpool]]. As he had to pay a royalty every time he performed the sketch, he bought the rights to ''Dinner for One'' in the 1950s, which turned out to be a very prescient decision.

At the age of 55, Frinton became a belated success as the [[plumber]] husband in the popular television [[British sitcom|sitcom]] ''[[Meet the Wife]]'', which ran for 40 episodes (the wife was played by [[Thora Hird]]). The series is mentioned in the [[The Beatles|Beatles]] song "[[Good Morning Good Morning]]" with the line ''"It's time for tea and ''Meet the Wife''"''. In October 1968, at the age of 59, Freddie Frinton died suddenly from a [[heart attack]] in London. He is buried in [[City of Westminster Cemetery, Hanwell|City of Westminster Cemetery]], [[Hanwell]].

===''Dinner for One''===
In 1963, Frinton's ''[[Dinner for One]]'' was recorded by the [[Norddeutscher Rundfunk]] (NDR) German television station, and watching the unsubtitled English language sketch on television has subsequently become a German, Austrian and Swiss [[New Year's Eve]] tradition, with the short seeing multiple repeats every year from 1972 onwards.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hooper|first=John|title=British comedy lives on in German television|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2002/dec/31/broadcasting.germany|newspaper=The Guardian|date=31 December 2002|accessdate=4 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="slate"&gt;{{cite web|last=Stewart|first=Jude|title=The Mystery of Dinner for One|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2133551/|work=Slate|date=30 December 2005|accessdate=4 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The role of Miss Sophie was played by [[May Warden]].

The [[cult television|television cult]] also caught on in Scandinavia and ''Dinner for One'' has been a hugely popular institution on Norwegian, Danish, Finnish, Estonian and Swedish television on New Year's Eve for many years, as well as in Belgium in the original version. It became so popular that a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] version was made with the Dutch actor [[Joop Doderer]] for Dutch viewers. It is shown every 23 December on Norwegian television ([[NRK]] since 1980), and has been shown on the Australian [[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]] television network on New Year's Eve for at least the last fifteen years. In South Africa the SABC likewise aired it every New Year's Eve, making it a family tradition during the 1980s and 1990s. The programme and its main actor Frinton are far less well known in [[UK|Britain]] than in any of these countries.

Although he was an actor whose roles often comprised playing a drunk, Frinton was a [[Teetotalism|teetotaller]] (complete abstinence from alcoholic beverages), having seen in others the damage that [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] could do.&lt;ref name="g2"&gt;{{cite web|last=Simkins|first=Michael|title=Acting drunk can be staggeringly difficult|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/nov/12/drinking-welsh-police-actors|newspaper=The Guardian|date=12 November 2010|accessdate=4 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frinton was married twice – firstly, in 1931, to Maisie Basil, and secondly to Nora Gratton, in 1945. He had a son by his first marriage, and four further children by his second – two daughters and two sons.
