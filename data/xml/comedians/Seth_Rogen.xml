'''Seth Aaron Rogen''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|oʊ|ɡ|ən}}; born April 15, 1982)&lt;ref name=biography-fyi&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.biography.com/people/seth-rogen-21065777 | title =Seth Rogen Biography: Actor, Comedian, Director, Producer (1982–)| publisher= Biography.com ([[FYI (US TV Channel)|FYI]]/[[A&amp;E Networks]]) | accessdate= January 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a Canadian actor, comedian, writer, producer, and director. He began his career performing [[stand-up comedy]] during his teenage years. While still living in his native [[Vancouver]], he landed a supporting role in [[Judd Apatow]]'s series ''[[Freaks and Geeks]]''. Shortly after he moved to [[Los Angeles]] for his role, ''Freaks and Geeks'' was officially cancelled after one season due to low viewership. Rogen later got a part on sitcom ''[[Undeclared]]'', which also hired him as a writer.

After landing his job as a staff writer on the final season of ''[[Da Ali G Show]]'', Apatow guided him toward a film career. Rogen made his first movie appearance in ''[[Donnie Darko]]'' with a minor role in 2001. Rogen was cast in a supporting role and credited as a co-producer in Apatow's directorial debut, ''[[The 40-Year-Old Virgin]]''. [[Universal Pictures]] subsequently cast him as the lead in Apatow's films ''[[Knocked Up]]'' and ''[[Funny People]]''. Rogen co-starred as [[Steve Wozniak]] in Universal's ''[[Steve Jobs (film)|Steve Jobs]]'' biopic in 2015. In 2016, he developed the [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] television series ''[[Preacher (TV series)|Preacher]]'' with his writing partner [[Evan Goldberg]] and [[Sam Catlin]]. He also serves as a writer, executive producer, and director with Goldberg.

Rogen and Goldberg co-wrote the films ''[[Superbad (film)|Superbad]]'', ''[[Pineapple Express (film)|Pineapple Express]]'', ''[[The Green Hornet (2011 film)|The Green Hornet]]'', ''[[This Is the End]]'', and directed both ''This Is the End'' and ''[[The Interview]]''; all of which Rogen starred in. He has also done voice work for the films ''[[Horton Hears a Who! (film)|Horton Hears a Who!]]'', the ''[[Kung Fu Panda (franchise)|Kung Fu Panda]]'' film series, ''[[The Spiderwick Chronicles (film)|The Spiderwick Chronicles]]'', ''[[Monsters vs. Aliens]]'', ''[[Paul (film)|Paul]]'', ''[[Sausage Party]]'', and will provide the voice of [[Timon and Pumbaa|Pumbaa]] in the 2019 [[The Lion King (2019 film)|remake]] of  ''[[The Lion King]]''.

==Early life==
Rogen was born in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], to a [[Jewish]] family. His mother, Sandy ([[née]] Belogus), is a [[social worker]], and his father, Mark Rogen, worked for [[Non-governmental organization|non-profit organization]]s and as an assistant director of the [[Workmen's Circle]] Jewish fraternal organization.&lt;ref name="mark"/&gt;&lt;ref name="guardianinterview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="torontostar"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/article/471435 |title=Seth Rogen sells |first=Richard |last=Ouzounian |work=[[Toronto Star]] |date=August 3, 2008 |accessdate=June 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rodrick, Stephen.

Retrieved January 7, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Since Rogen's father is American, he has American citizenship by birth, though the actor has stated "I definitely associate with being Canadian much more than being American" because he grew up in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Seth Rogen's guide to making movies: lie to the studio, hire your friends, offend the church and have a lot of fun |publisher=[[News.com.au]] |date=July 12, 2013 |url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/movies/seth-rogen8217s-guide-to-making-movies-lie-to-the-studio-hire-your-friends-offend-the-church-and-have-a-lot-of-fun/story-e6frfmvr-1226678977733 |accessdate=October 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has described his parents, who met on kibbutz [[Beit Alfa]] in [[Israel]], as "radical Jewish socialists."&lt;ref name="guardianinterview"&gt;{{cite news |last=Patterson |first=John |title=Comedy's new centre of gravity |work=[[The Guardian]]|date=September 14, 2007 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/sep/14/3 |accessdate=June 16, 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rogen has an older sister named Danya,&lt;ref name="mark"/&gt; and attended [[Vancouver Talmud Torah]] Elementary School and [[Point Grey Secondary School]], incorporating many of his classmates into his writing.

As a child, Rogen did not want to pursue any career other than comedy, stating "As soon as I realized you could be funny as a job, that was the job I wanted".&lt;ref name="torontostar"/&gt; He got his start in show business at age 12 after enrolling in a comedy workshop taught by Mark Pooley.&lt;ref name="mark"/&gt; His early comedy routines involved jokes about his [[bar mitzvah]], his grandparents, and his camp counsellors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Mia|last=Lardiere|url=http://www.celebuzz.com/2015-10-01/seth-rogen-bar-mitzvah-photo-tbt/|title= Please Advise Seth Rogen’s Bar Mitzvah Photo for Fall Style Inspiration|work=Celebuzz|date=October 1, 2015 |accessdate= April 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mark"/&gt; During his teenage years, he would perform [[stand-up comedy]] routines at places like bar mitzvahs and small parties, later shifting to bars.&lt;ref name="tdt09"/&gt;&lt;ref name="timesonline"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/men/article4787884.ece |title=On the Move: Seth Rogen |date=September 21, 2008 |work=[[The Sunday Times]] |accessdate=June 16, 2011 |location=London |first=Sadie |last=Gray}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[mohel]] paid him to write jokes.&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt; At the age of&amp;nbsp;13, he co-wrote a rough draft of ''[[Superbad (film)|Superbad]]'' with childhood friend [[Evan Goldberg]], whom he had met at [[Bar and Bat Mitzvah|bar mitzvah]] classes.&lt;ref name="torontostar"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1622581,00.html|title=The Education of A Comic Prodigy|last=Stein|first=Joel|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=May 17, 2007|accessdate=January 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Horatia|last=Harrod|title=Seth Rogen: 'I asked Fassbender: "Are you, like, weird?'" |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/film/steve-jobs/seth-rogen-interview/|work=The Telegraph|date=November 9, 2015|accessdate=May 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on their teenage experiences,&lt;ref name="guardianinterview"/&gt; Rogen and Goldberg spent the rest of their time in high school polishing the script. They initially worried that ''[[American Pie (film)|American Pie]]'' (1999) had beaten them to the idea for the movie, but they decided that the film "managed to totally avoid all honest interaction between characters... which is what we're going for."&lt;ref name="guardianinterview"/&gt;

His mother was supportive of his comic endeavours and would often drive him to stand-up gigs at the [[comedy club]] Yuk Yuks.&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt; With his [[deadpan]] humour, he placed second in the Vancouver Amateur Comedy Contest at 16 years old.&lt;ref name="tdt09"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/5165671/Seth-Rogen-the-new-hero-of-comedy.html |first=Will |last=Lawrence |title=Seth Rogen: the new hero of comedy |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited |date=April 16, 2009 |accessdate=June 16, 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also when Rogen was 16, his father lost his job and his mother quit hers, forcing them to put their house up for sale and relocate to a significantly smaller apartment. Around this time, he landed a role on [[Judd Apatow]]'s television show ''[[Freaks and Geeks]]'' after attending a local [[casting call]].&lt;ref name="torontostar"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt; Despite a strong academic performance, Rogen dropped out of high school, began working for Apatow,&lt;ref name="latimesfg"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2011/03/freaks-and-geeks-paley-fest-judd-apatow-james-franco-jason-segel-seth-rogen.html |title=Judd Apatow's 'Freaks and Geeks' gang reminisces – and mocks James Franco |first=Amy |last=Kaufman |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=March 14, 2011 |accessdate=June 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ti2011"/&gt; and relocated with his family to [[Los Angeles]]. Rogen paid the bills and had become the main wage earner at just&amp;nbsp;16.&lt;ref name="torontostar"/&gt;

==Career==

===1999–2006: Early work and friendship with Judd Apatow===
Rogen's acting debut was in Apatow's ''[[Freaks and Geeks]]'', a [[cult hit]] series first released in 1999 as [[List of Freaks and Geeks characters#Ken Miller|Ken Miller]], a cynical, acerbic "freak".&lt;ref name="torontostar"/&gt; Revolving around a group of teenagers' lives, ''Freaks and Geeks'' first aired in 1999. Although well-reviewed, the show was [[NBC]]'s lowest-viewed program and was cancelled after one season due to poor ratings.&lt;ref name="latimesfg"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/columnist/popcandy/2004-04-06-pop-candy_x.htm |title=DVDs resurrect 'Freaks and Geeks' – and everyone in between |work=[[USA Today]] |first=Whitney |last=Matheson |date=April 6, 2004 |accessdate=June 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Impressed with Rogen's improvisational skills,&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt; Apatow then chose him as the lead in another of his shows, ''[[Undeclared]]''. Rogen was originally set to play a fairly popular but nerdy college freshman, but the network did not think he was leading male material. Apatow opted not to go along with the show.&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt; Rogen also served as a staff writer to the short-lived production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ifc.com/undeclared/cast/seth-rogen-1.php |title=Cast and Crew: Seth Rogen |publisher=[[Independent Film Channel|IFC]] |accessdate=June 17, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110907065533/http://www.ifc.com/undeclared/cast/seth-rogen-1.php |archivedate=September 7, 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tdtgeek"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/3558496/Seth-Rogen-Triumph-of-the-supergeek.html |title=Seth Rogen: Triumph of the supergeek |first=John |last=Hiscock |work=The Daily Telegraph |publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited |date=August 15, 2008 |accessdate=June 16, 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the show's cancellation in 2002, Rogen did not get many auditions, which was not upsetting to him as he always thought he would achieve better success as a writer.&lt;ref name="timepage2"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1622581,00.html |title=The Education of A Comic Prodigy |first=Joel |last=Stein |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=May 17, 2007 |accessdate=June 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He would soon be a part of Apatow's "frat pack", a close-knit group that includes [[Steve Carell]] and [[Paul Rudd]].&lt;ref name="tdt09"/&gt; Of the awkwardness of a grown man spending so much time with a teenaged Rogen, Apatow said: "I'm such a comedy fan that, even though he's&amp;nbsp;16, I know I'm hanging out with one of the guys who's going to be one of the great comics."&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt; Around this time, Apatow would come up with odd requests for Rogen and Goldberg, such as turn an idea of his into a movie in 10 days and come up with 100 one-page ideas for films.&lt;ref name="timepage2"/&gt; Regarding Apatow's professional effect on Rogen, the actor said in 2009, "Obviously, I can't stress how important Judd's been to my career".&lt;ref name="tdt09"/&gt;

Rogen had roles in ''[[Donnie Darko]]'' (2001) and ''[[Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy]]'' (2004).&lt;ref name="mtvjohnc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2009/07/31/funny-people-star-seth-rogen-was-in-donnie-darko-plus-other-rogen-cameos/ |title='Funny People' Star Seth Rogen Was In 'Donnie Darko'?!

===2007–2009: Breakthrough as a leading man===
[[File:SethRogen 7 2007.JPG|thumb|185px|upright|Rogen in 2007]]
His breakthrough came when [[Universal Studios]] greenlit him for the lead in yet another Apatow production: ''[[Knocked Up]]'' (2007), a [[romantic comedy]] that follows the repercussions of a drunken [[one-night stand]] between his slacker character and [[Katherine Heigl]]'s just-promoted [[media personality]] that results in an unintended pregnancy. Upon completing ''The 40-Year-Old Virgin'', Apatow had approached Rogen about potential starring roles, but the actor suggested many high-concept science fiction ideas. After Apatow insisted that he would work better in real life situations, the two agreed on the accidental pregnancy concept of this production.&lt;ref name="flickd"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/shared/movies/flickd/k/knocked_up_set_visit_060928/ |title=A (Kind of) New Star is Born |last=Carrol |first=Larry |publisher=MTV |date=September 28, 2006 |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rogen called shooting sex scenes with Heigl "nerve-racking" and found comfort with the supporting cast since, even though he played a lead, the focus was not all on him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://collider.com/entertainment/article.asp/aid/4457/cid/13/tcid/1 |title=Seth Rogen interview – Knocked Up |publisher=Collider |date=May 24, 2007 |accessdate=June 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pineapple usatoday"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2007-05-29-seth-rogen_N.htm |title=Many faces of Rogen keep them laughing |first=Susan |last=Wloszczyna |work=USA Today |date=May 30, 2007 |accessdate=June 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Made on a $30&amp;nbsp;million budget and released on June 1, ''Knocked Up'' was a critical and commercial [[box office]] hit, garnering an approval rating of 90&amp;nbsp;percent on [[review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]] and grossing $219&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/knocked_up/ |title=Knocked Up (2007) |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=knockedup.htm |title=Knocked Up |publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]] |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rogen also received favourable reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.salon.com/entertainment/movies/review/2007/06/01/knocked_up |title=Knocked Up |first=Stephanie |last=Zacharek |work=[[Salon.com|Salon]] |date=June 1, 2007 |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/movies/display?display=movie&amp;id=9122 |first=Wesley |last=Morris |title=In 'Knocked Up,' family values get a twist|work=Boston Globe |date=June 1, 2007 |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year he played a supporting part as an irresponsible police officer in ''[[Superbad (film)|Superbad]]'', which he had written with his writing partner and was co-produced by Apatow.
