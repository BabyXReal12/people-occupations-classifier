==Early life==
Macdonald was born in [[Quebec City]], Canada.&lt;ref name="TVGuide"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/celebrities/norm-macdonald/bio/168320/|title=Norm Macdonald |publisher=[[TV Guide|TVGuide.com]] |accessdate= December 11, 2015|archivedate=September 9, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150909051914/http://www.tvguide.com/celebrities/norm-macdonald/bio/168320/|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has a brother, [[Neil Macdonald]], who is a journalist with [[CBC News]].&lt;ref name=uptown&gt;{{cite web|last=Story|first=Jared |date=September 23, 2010 |url=http://www.uptownmag.com/arts/features/Norm-Macdonald-talks-to-Uptown-103645619.html |title=Norm Macdonald talks to Uptown|publisher=Uptown |location=Winnipeg|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100928071531/http://www.uptownmag.com/arts/features/Norm-Macdonald-talks-to-Uptown-103645619.html|archivedate=September 28, 2010|deadurl=yes |quote=Yeah, my brother is a news reporter.

==Career==
Macdonald's first performances in comedy were at [[stand-up comedy|stand-up]] clubs in Ottawa. He appeared at the 1987 [[Just For Laughs]] Comedy Festival in Montreal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Norm Macdonald Biography|first=Todd |last=Jackson |url=http://www.dead-frog.com/comedians/comic/norm_macdonald/|publisher=Dead-Frog |accessdate=March 24, 2011}}{{Dubious|date=May 2011}}&lt;!-- please locate a more reliable source than this --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Saturday Night Live''===
Macdonald joined the cast of [[NBC]]'s ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (''SNL'') television program in 1993, where he performed impressions of [[Larry King]], [[Burt Reynolds]], [[David Letterman]], [[Quentin Tarantino]], [[Charles Kuralt]] and [[Bob Dole]], among others. Following [[Kevin Nealon]]'s departure from ''SNL'', Macdonald anchored the segment "[[Weekend Update]]". Current "Weekend Update" anchor and writer [[Colin Jost]] named Macdonald as a primary influence on Jost's own work behind the "Update" desk, explaining that Macdonald's tone was one that Jost grew up with in high school.&lt;ref name=Fretts&gt;Fretts, Bruce (April 7, 2014). "Surely You Jost!". ''[[TV Guide]]''. p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Macdonald's version of "Weekend Update" often included references to prison rape, [[crack whore]]s, and the Germans' love of ''[[Baywatch]]'' star [[David Hasselhoff]]. Macdonald would occasionally deliver a piece of news, then take out his personal compact [[tape recorder]] and leave a "note to self" relevant to what he just discussed. He commonly used [[Frank Stallone]] as a [[Non sequitur (absurdism)|non sequitur]] [[Punch line|punchline]]. Macdonald repeatedly ridiculed public figures such as [[Marion Barry]], [[Hillary Clinton]], [[Michael Jackson]] and [[O. J. Simpson]]. Throughout [[O. J. Simpson murder case|Simpson's murder trial]], Macdonald constantly pilloried the former football star, often heavily implying Simpson was guilty of the brutal slaying of his ex-wife [[Nicole Brown Simpson|Nicole]] and her friend [[Ronald Goldman]]. In the broadcast following Simpson's [[acquittal]], Macdonald opened "Weekend Update" by saying: "Well, it is finally official: Murder is legal in the state of California."

During the February 24, 1996, episode, Macdonald made a controversial joke about the sentencing of John Lotter, one of the two men who committed the notorious murder of [[Brandon Teena]]: "In Falls City, Nebraska, John Lotter has been sentenced to death for attempting to kill three people in what prosecutors called a plot to silence a cross-dressing female who had accused him of rape. Now this might strike some viewers as harsh, but I believe everyone involved in this story should die."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Challenging Lesbian Norms: Intersex, Transgender, Intersectional, and Queer Perspectives|first=Angela |last=Pattatucci Aragon |publisher=[[Routledge]] |page=28 |year=2006 |isbn=978-1-56023-645-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=usruybRjfMUC&amp;lpg=PA28&amp;pg=PA28#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Riki Anne |last=Wilchins |title=Subject: Saturday Night Live: Brandon Teena &amp; Friends '...Deserved To Die.'|work=Qrd.org |publisher=[[Queer Resources Directory]] |date=February 28, 1996 |url=http://www.qrd.org/qrd/trans/1996/snl.slur.response-02.28.96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the announcement that [[Michael Jackson]] and [[Lisa Marie Presley]] planned to divorce, Macdonald joked about their irreconcilable differences on "Weekend Update": "She's more of a stay-at-home type, and he's more of a homosexual pedophile." He followed this up a few episodes later with a report about the singer's collapse and hospitalization. Referring to a report that Jackson had decorated his hospital room with giant photographs of [[Shirley Temple]], Macdonald remarked that viewers should not get the wrong idea, adding, "Michael Jackson is a ''homosexual'' pedophile."

On the April 12, 1997, show (host [[Rob Lowe]], musical guest [[The Spice Girls]]), during a "Weekend Update" story about [[Tabitha Soren]], Macdonald accidentally coughed in the middle of a sentence and muttered, "What the fuck was that?" The audience applauded, and Macdonald laughed the error away (saying at one point "My farewell performance" and, in closing, "Maybe we'll see you next week").

====Leaving ''SNL''====
In early 1998, [[Don Ohlmeyer]] had Macdonald removed as "[[Weekend Update]]" anchor, citing declining ratings and a dropoff in quality. Macdonald and others believed that the real reason for his dismissal was his series of jokes calling [[O. J. Simpson]] a murderer during and after the [[O. J. Simpson murder case|trial]]; Ohlmeyer was good friends with Simpson and supported him during the proceedings.&lt;ref name=Carter&gt;{{cite news|title=TV Notes; Ohlmeyer Vs. Macdonald|first=Bill|last=Carter|date=June 3, 1998|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/03/arts/tv-notes-ohlmeyer-vs-macdonald.html|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After being removed from the role, Macdonald went on CBS's ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' and [[Howard Stern]]'s syndicated radio show accusing Ohlmeyer of firing him for making jokes about Simpson.&lt;ref name=Carter/&gt; The jokes were written primarily by Macdonald and longtime ''SNL'' writer [[Jim Downey (comedian)|Jim Downey]], who was fired from ''SNL'' outright at the same time. Downey pointed out in an interview that Ohlmeyer threw a party for the jurors who acquitted Simpson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://splitsider.com/2014/06/snls-james-downey-on-working-with-norm-macdonald-and-getting-fired-for-making-fun-of-oj-simpson|title='SNL's James Downey on Working with Norm Macdonald and Getting Fired for Making Fun of OJ Simpson|first=Mike|last=Sacks|date=June 24, 2014|accessdate=December 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Macdonald was replaced by [[Colin Quinn]] at the "Weekend Update" desk beginning on the January 10, 1998 episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://splitsider.com/2013/11/saturday-nights-children-norm-macdonald-1993-1998/|title=Saturday Night’s Children: Norm Macdonald (1993–1998)|date=November 5, 2013|newspaper=Splitsider|access-date=January 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ohlmeyer claimed that Macdonald was mistaken, pointing out that he had not censored [[Jay Leno]]'s many jokes about Simpson on ''The Tonight Show''.&lt;ref name=Carter/&gt; Ohlmeyer stated that he was concerned that ratings research showed people turning away from the program during Macdonald's segment, and network insiders told the New York ''Daily News'' that Ohlmeyer and other executives had tried several times to get Macdonald to try a different approach on "Update".&lt;ref name="Honcho"&gt;{{cite news|title=Gloves Off as Comic Rips NBC Honcho|first=Eric|last=Mink|publisher=New York Daily News|date=June 5, 1998|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/gloves-comic-rips-nbc-honcho-article-1.794946}}&lt;/ref&gt; Media watchers pointed out that if Macdonald had been viewed as unfunny by [[Lorne Michaels]] his removal would have occurred at the end of the season, without any media attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Bizarre Circumstances And Shaky Aftermath Of Norm Macdonald’s Dismissal From Weekend Update|first=John|last=Hugar|date=February 13, 2015|publisher=Uproxx|url=http://uproxx.com/tv/norm-macdonald-snl-weekend-update-fired/}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Matters intensified when Ohlmeyer caused NBC to refuse to play MGM's advertisements for Macdonald's movie ''Dirty Work'' out of retaliation for what he saw as disparaging ''SNL'' and NBC with Letterman and Stern.&lt;ref name="Carter"/&gt; Ohlmeyer's boss, Robert Wright, later overturned the decision not to show ads for the movie on NBC, but did leave in place the ban on playing it during ''SNL''.&lt;ref name=Frankel&gt;{{cite news|title=Norm Macdonald Wins "Dirty" War|first=Daniel|last=Frankel|date=June 9, 1998|publisher=E! News|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/36539/norm-macdonald-wins-dirty-war}}&lt;/ref&gt; Macdonald continued to insist that he did not personally dislike Ohlmeyer but that Ohlmeyer hated him.&lt;ref name=Frankel/&gt;

Macdonald remained on ''SNL'' as a cast member, but he disliked performing in regular sketches. On February 28, 1998, in one of his last appearances on ''SNL'', he played the host of a fictitious TV show called ''Who's More Grizzled?'' who asked questions of "[[mountain man|mountain men]]" played by that night's host [[Garth Brooks]] and special guest [[Robert Duvall]]. In the sketch, Brooks's character said to Macdonald's character, "I don't much care for you," to which Macdonald replied, "A lot of people don't." He was fired shortly thereafter.

Macdonald complained about the NBC advertising removal for his film to the New York ''Daily News'', calling Ohlmeyer "a liar and a thug".&lt;ref name=Honcho/&gt; He said he never badmouthed ''SNL'' or Michaels, who he said always supported him. Macdonald pointed out that he had only taken issue with Ohlmeyer, while the people taking shots at NBC and ''SNL'' were Letterman (who wanted Macdonald to come to CBS) and Stern (who wanted him to join [[The Howard Stern Show (WWOR)|his show]] opposite ''SNL'').&lt;ref name=Frankel/&gt; Macdonald also asserted that Ohlmeyer's influence had caused his promotional appearances for his film to be cancelled on WNBC's ''[[Today in New York]]'', NBC's ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'', and the syndicated ''[[Access Hollywood]]'' (a joint venture between 20th Century Television and NBC).&lt;ref name=Honcho/&gt; The shows Macdonald named denied being influenced by Ohlmeyer.&lt;ref name=Honcho/&gt; Macdonald said Ohlmeyer was "about a thousand times more powerful than I am. It's difficult for anybody to take my side in this. This guy should get a life, man."&lt;ref name=Honcho/&gt;

It was felt that there was some irony in the situation as ''Dirty Work'' was a revenge comedy. When an interviewer pointed this out Macdonald said "It would be good revenge if everybody went and saw this movie if they want to get revenge against Don Ohlmeyer for trying to ban my ads."&lt;ref name=Frankel/&gt;

In a ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' interview, Macdonald said that after being dismissed from anchoring "Weekend Update" and leaving ''SNL'', he could not "do anything else on any competing show."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people=Letterman, David|title=Late Night with David Letterman|medium=TV series|publisher=CBS|location=New York|date=March 6, 1998|url=http://www.fakenews.net/archive/transcripts/1998_03_06_TLS.html|accessdate=February 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In later years Macdonald came to the conclusion that Ohlmeyer had not removed him from "Update" for his Simpson material. He told an interviewer that he felt he had been removed because people on the show stopped seeing him as funny: "I think the whole show was tired of me not taking marching orders. Lorne would hint at things...I'd do Michael Jackson jokes. And Lorne would say, Do you really want a lawsuit from Michael Jackson? And I'd say, 'Cool! That'd be fuckin' cool, Michael Jackson suing me!'"&lt;ref name=WTF&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Huffington Post|title=Norm Macdonald On 'WTF': Lorne Michaels Wanted A Female 'Weekend Update' Co-Anchor|first=Ross|last=Luippold|date=October 18, 2011|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/10/18/norm-macdonald-on-wtf-weekend-update_n_1018246.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere Macdonald said, "In all fairness to him, my ''Update'' was not an audience pleasing, warm kind of thing. I did jokes that I knew weren't going to get bigger reactions. So I saw [Ohlmeyer's] point. Why would you want some dude who's not trying to please the audience?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maybe it Wasn't the O.J.

===After ''SNL''===
Soon after leaving ''Saturday Night Live'', Macdonald co-wrote and starred in the "revenge comedy" ''[[Dirty Work (1998 film)|Dirty Work]]'' (1998), directed by [[Bob Saget]] and co-starring [[Artie Lange]] and featuring [[Chris Farley]] in his last movie; the film was dedicated to his memory. Later that year, Macdonald voiced the character of Lucky the dog in the [[Eddie Murphy]] adaptation of ''[[Dr. Dolittle (film)|Dr. Dolittle]]''. He reprised the role in both ''[[Dr. Dolittle 2]]'' (2001) and ''[[Dr. Dolittle 3]]'' (2006). Macdonald voiced the character of Death on an episode of ''[[Family Guy]]''. Because of a conflict with his stand-up comedy schedule,{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} he was unavailable to voice the character for his next appearance; Death has since been voiced by [[Adam Carolla]]. In 1999, Macdonald starred in the sitcom ''[[The Norm Show]]'' (later renamed ''Norm''), co-starring [[Laurie Metcalf]], Artie Lange, and [[Ian Gomez]]. It ran for three seasons on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. Macdonald also voiced [[Hardee's]] restaurants' ([[Carl's Jr.]] on the U.S. west coast) costumed [[mascot]].{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} Macdonald appeared on several [[Miller Lite]] commercials that year.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} He appeared on the September 1999 ''Saturday Night Live'' primetime special celebrating the program's 25th year on the air.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Macdonald returned to ''Saturday Night Live'' to host the October 23, 1999 show. In his opening [[monologue]], he expressed resentment at being fired from "Weekend Update", then concluded that the only reason he was asked to host was because "the show has gotten really bad" since he left,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://snltranscripts.jt.org/99/99cmono.phtml |title=Norm Macdonald's Monologue |publisher=SNLTranscripts.jt.org |date=October 23, 1999|accessdate=February 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; echoing a perennial criticism of the show. The next episode, airing November 6, 1999, and hosted by [[Dylan McDermott]], featured a sketch wherein [[Chris Kattan]], as the androgynous character Mango, is opening letters from celebrity admirers and, after opening the last one, says "[The letter is from] Norm Macdonald—who is that?" Earlier in 1999, Macdonald made a cameo appearance in the [[Andy Kaufman]] biographical drama ''[[Man on the Moon (film)|Man on the Moon]]''. When [[Michael Richards]] refused to portray himself in the scene reenacting the famous ''[[Fridays (ABC TV Series)|Fridays]]'' [[Fridays (TV series)#Andy Kaufman incident|incident]] in which Kaufman threw water in his face, Macdonald stepped in to play Richards, although he was not referred to by name.

In 2000, Macdonald played the starring role for the second time in a motion picture, ''[[Screwed (2000 film)|Screwed]]'', which fared poorly at the box office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=screwed.htm|title=Screwed|website=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=July 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 12, 2000, he appeared on the Celebrity Edition of ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]]'', winning $500,000 for Paul Newman's Hole in the Wall Charity Camp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDkJCvUIhoY |title=Norm on Millionaire Part 3 |publisher=YouTube |date=October 28, 2006 |accessdate=May 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Macdonald continued to make appearances on television shows and in films. In 2003 he played the title character in the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] sitcom ''[[A Minute with Stan Hooper]]'', which was canceled after six episodes.

In 2005, Macdonald signed a deal with [[Comedy Central]] to create the [[sketch comedy]] ''Back to Norm'', which debuted that May. The pilot was never turned into a series. Its [[cold opening]] parodied the suicide of [[Budd Dwyer]], a Pennsylvania politician who, facing decades of incarceration, committed suicide on live television in 1987. [[Rob Schneider]] appeared in the pilot. Later in 2005, Macdonald performed as a voice actor, portraying a [[genie]] named [[Norm the Genie|Norm]], on two episodes of the cartoon series ''[[The Fairly OddParents]],'' but could not return for the third episode, "[[Fairy Idol]]", owing to a scheduling conflict.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} In 2006, Macdonald again performed as a voice actor, this time in a series of commercials for the Canadian cellphone-services provider [[Bell Mobility]], as the voice of "Frank the Beaver".{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} The campaign was extended through 2008 to promote offerings from other [[Bell Canada]] divisions such as the Internet provider [[Bell Sympatico]] and  the satellite service [[Bell TV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bell Recruits Two New Spokesbeavers |publisher=Cossette.com |date=November 7, 2005 |url=http://www.cossette.com/affiche/nouvelles/details.asp?div=0&amp;id=1961 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928115312/http://www.cossette.com/affiche/nouvelles/details.asp?div=0&amp;id=1961 |archivedate=September 28, 2007 |accessdate=April 21, 2007}} Announcement With links to two QuickTime videos.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2006, Macdonald's sketch comedy album ''Ridiculous'' was released by [[Comedy Central Records]]. It features appearances by [[Will Ferrell]], [[Jon Lovitz]], [[Tim Meadows]], [[Molly Shannon]] and [[Artie Lange]]. Macdonald was a guest character on ''[[My Name Is Earl]]'' in the episode "[[Two Balls, Two Strikes]]" as "Lil Chubby", the son of "Chubby" (played by [[Burt Reynolds]]), similar to Macdonald's portrayals of Reynolds on ''SNL''.

In the [[2007 World Series of Poker]], he came in 20th place out of 827 entrants in the $3,000 No Limit [[Texas Hold 'em]] event, winning $14,608.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.WSOP.com/tournaments/results.asp?grid=309&amp;tid=3455|title=The 2007 World Series of Poker – No-Limit Hold'em (Event 28)|publisher=Caesar's Interactive Entertainment|date=June 17–19, 2007|accessdate=July 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made it to round two of the $5,000 World Championship of Heads-Up No-Limit Hold'em.

In June 2012, he became the spokesperson for [[Safe Auto Insurance Company]]. Along with television and radio commercials, web banners and outdoor boards, the effort included a series of made-for-web videos. As part of the campaign, the state minimum auto insurance company introduced a new tagline, "Drive Safe, Spend Less."

In 2013, Macdonald premiered his new podcast, called ''[[Norm Macdonald Live]]'', co-hosted by Adam Eget, streaming live weekly on Video Podcast Network, and posted later on [[YouTube]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/61647 |title=Wait!!

In 2014, Macdonald unsuccessfully campaigned on [[Twitter]] to be named the new host of ''[[The Late Late Show (CBS TV series)|The Late Late Show]]'' after then-host [[Craig Ferguson]] announced he would be leaving.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Bradford.

On May 15, 2015, Macdonald was the final stand-up act on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' and included in his set a joke Letterman had told the first time Macdonald had ever seen him, during his appearance on a Canadian talk show, ''[[90 Minutes Live]]'', in the 1970s, where a teenaged Macdonald had been in the studio audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Norm Macdonald gives David Letterman an emotional, beautiful send-off|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/05/16/norm-macdonald-david-letterman-tribute|accessdate=May 16, 2015|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=May 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2015, Macdonald was a judge for the ninth season of NBC's ''[[Last Comic Standing]]'', joining the previous season's judges, [[Roseanne Barr]] and [[Keenan Ivory Wayans]] and replacing fellow Canadian [[Russell Peters]] from 2014.

In August 2015, he succeeded [[Darrell Hammond]] as [[Colonel Sanders]] in TV commercials for the [[KFC]] chain of fast food restaurants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hanks|first1=Henry|title=KFC has another new Colonel Sanders: Norm Macdonald|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/17/entertainment/norm-macdonald-kfc-sanders-feat/index.html|publisher=CNN|accessdate=August 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.businessinsider.com/kfc-brings-on-last-comic-standing-judge-norm-macdonald-as-its-new-colonel-2015-8| title=KFC has another new Colonel – and it'll be hoping some viewers hate these ads as much as the last |website=Business Insider| first=Lara |last=O'Reilly |date=August 17, 2015 |accessdate=January 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Macdonald was replaced by [[Jim Gaffigan]] in the role by February 2016.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Lauren|url=http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/kfc-swaps-out-norm-macdonald-jim-gaffigan-its-latest-real-colonel-169469|title=KFC Swaps Out Norm Macdonald for Jim Gaffigan as Its Latest 'Real' Colonel|work=[[Adweek]]|date=February 6, 2016|accessdate=July 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of May 2017, Macdonald has continued to evolve in his stand-up, moving towards a more reserved, [[deadpan]] style. On stage he has claimed to have "no opinions" and the minimalist delivery has been described by ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' as "reduc[ing] gesture and verbiage down to an absurd minimum."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.avclub.com/review/norm-macdonald-owns-his-deadpan-minimalism-new-net-254787 |first=Jesse |last=Hassenger |date=2017-05-10| title=Norm Macdonald owns his deadpan minimalism in new Netflix special|accessdate=2017-06-28 |publisher=The A.V.

==Influences and views on comedy==
Macdonald says his influences include [[Bob Newhart]],&lt;ref&gt;''Ridiculous'', Norm Macdonald, 2006, [[Comedy Central Records]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leo Tolstoy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |last=MacPherson |first=Guy |interviewer=Guy MacPherson |title=What's So Funny? |url=http://wsf1027fm.blogspot.fi/2012/07/podcast-episode-287ish-norm-macdonald.html |date=July 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bob Hope]],&lt;ref name="Hughezy"&gt;{{cite interview |last=Hughezy |first=|interviewer=Hughezy |title=HughezyVSTheWorld |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsP355LvAN8 |date=October 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sam Kinison]],&lt;ref name="Hughezy"/&gt; and [[Dennis Miller]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |last=Miller |first=Dennis |interviewer=Dennis Miller |title=The Dennis Miller Show |last2=Macdonald |first2=Norm |url=http://www.dennismillerradio.com/b/SNL-Power-Hour:-Norm-MacDonald--Jason-Sudeikis!/819509015359385647.html |date=June 16, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130629193547/http://www.dennismillerradio.com/b/SNL-Power-Hour:-Norm-MacDonald--Jason-Sudeikis!/819509015359385647.html |archivedate=June 29, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking about Canada's homegrown comedy industry, Macdonald reflected that he would have liked there to have been more opportunity for him to stay in the country early in his career, stating:
{{quote|Now I know there's more of, like, an industry there. Like I was happy that [[Brent Butt]] got ''[[Corner Gas]]''. Because he's a really funny guy. But there wasn't that opportunity when I was there. I remember Mike MacDonald had one [[Mosquito Lake (TV series)|short-lived series]], but that was about it. Otherwise there was nothing to do. But it was great with standup. It was way, way better with standup than in the States. Like, I think the standups are generally much better in Canada. Because, like, when I was in Canada, none of us had any ambition to movies or TV because there were no movies or television. So it was all standup and we just assumed we'd be standups for our whole lives and that was what was fun. And then when I came to the States, I realized, whoa, they don't take their standup very seriously here because they're just trying to do something other than standup and using standup as, like, a springboard to something else that they're generally not as good at.&lt;ref name="Phone"/&gt;}}

Reflecting on the state of modern comedy, Macdonald bemoans the influx of dramatic actors into comedy and comedians into dramatic acting:
{{quote|What young, handsome person is funny? I remember on ''Saturday Night Live'' hosts would come in. You know, like handsome hosts. They'd be dramatic actors generally. And the publicist would always be like, "This is a big chance for this guy because he's really a funny guy and people don't know it. He's hilarious!" And then he'd just suck, you know?...I always liked Steve Martin when he was crazy. Because dramatic actors know how to be likeable and stuff. To me, if you've got a guy like Steve Martin or Jim Carrey or something, who are unbelievably funny, I don't know why they'd want to be dramatic actors when they have no chance. They're completely outclassed by actual dramatic actors. How many funny comedy actors are there? There's like a million great dramatic actors. I don't know why they'd want to switch. I guess to get respect or something, I don't know.&lt;ref name="Phone"/&gt;}}

In his January 29th, 2018 Reddit AMA, Macdonald called [[Cormac McCarthy]] and [[Alice Munro]] the "two greatest living writers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |last=Macdonald |first=Norm |interviewer=Reddit AMA |title=Hi. I'm Norm Macdonald. I'm here to do my reddit AMA. Gene at The Washington Post is helping me today. |url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/7ttism/hi_im_norm_macdonald_im_here_to_do_my_reddit_ama/ |date=January 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political views==
Despite referring to himself as [[Apoliticism|apolitical]], Macdonald has made political statements. At the end of the last ''[[Weekend Update]]'' segment before the [[United States presidential election, 1996|1996 presidential election]], Macdonald urged viewers to vote for [[Bob Dole]] (of whom Macdonald frequently performed a comic impersonation), though hinting that he had solely said it so that he could continue impersonating him.

On the November 16, 2000, episode of ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]'' Macdonald said that he thought [[George W. Bush]] was "a decent man" and he called [[Bill Clinton]] a "murderer" (regarding the [[Vince Foster]] case). Macdonald later stated in ''[[Maxim magazine|Maxim]]'' magazine that he is completely apolitical, and that he was joking when he said Clinton "killed a guy" (he further explained on ''[[The Adam Carolla Show (terrestrial radio)|The Adam Carolla Show]]'' that the comments were simply designed to anger [[Barbara Walters]]). In a phone interview, he later clarified his views on George W. Bush and the [[Iraq War]] thus: "I wish there was another president, a different president engaging the war, since we're in the war because I don't think Bush did a very good job with it. The war itself, you know, if it works it was worth it. But I don't know if it's going to work, so I don't know".&lt;ref name="Phone"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comedycouch.com/interviews/nmacdonald.htm|title= Norm Macdonald|first=Guy |last=MacPherson|date=January 17, 2006|publisher=(interview) ComedyCouch.com|accessdate=October 3, 2010| archivedate=November 8, 2006 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061108171818/http://comedycouch.com/interviews/nmacdonald.htm| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 29, 2003, Macdonald again appeared on ''The View'' and jokingly renounced his Canadian citizenship over his home country's decision not to participate in the Iraq War. He furthermore stated his belief that [[Ronald Reagan]] was the greatest president ever and said he would become a [[naturalized citizen]] of the United States. In  2006 he affirmed he was joking about renouncing his Canadian citizenship, stating:
{{quote|I'm not an [[American nationality law|American citizen]]. I'm a Canadian citizen. I just keep renewing my [[Permanent residence (United States)|green card]]. ... I don't want to be American. ...  I can vote in Canadian elections ... [but] I never did when I was in Canada... I never voted because I don't want to make a mistake. I'm so uninformed that I don't want that on my hands, you know?&lt;ref name="Phone"/&gt;}}

In an interview in June  2017, Macdonald was asked if he finds satire involving [[Donald Trump]] funny, to which Macdonald responded, "Personally, with comedy, I think if it doesn’t make you laugh 100 years from now, what good is it? Have you listened to a [[Mort Sahl]] album lately? The [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] stuff is a little weak." He added of Trump, "You know, people say stuff like, 'You gotta wake up. Trump and his boys are trying to take over. There’s a coup going on.' That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. I don't know much, but I know coups are not undertaken by the President of the United States. If anything, it looks like a coup going on the other way. They’re talking about impeaching a guy before any investigation has even begun."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vulture.com/2017/06/norm-macdonald-special-donald-trump-snl.html|title=Norm Macdonald on Why He’s Tired of Trump Satire and the Joke He’ll Never Tell Again|publisher=[[Vulture.com]] ([[New York (magazine)|New York]])|last=Marchese|first= David|date=June 5, 2017|access-date=January 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
He is divorced from wife Connie,&lt;ref name=nndb&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.nndb.com/people/707/000022641/| title=Norm MacDonald [sic]| publisher=[[NNDB.com]]| accessdate= September 13, 2016|archivedate= July 30, 2016| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160730012556/http://www.nndb.com/people/707/000022641/|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; with whom he has a son, Dylan, born circa 1993.&lt;ref name=wapo-august /&gt;

Macdonald said his past gambling addiction had been initiated by a six-figure win at a [[craps]] table in Atlantic City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Macdonald, Norm |date=October 17, 2016 |year= |title=Larry King Now |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tK3I6Z0yB_k |access-date=February 22, 2017 |time=23:21 |location= |publisher=[[YouTube]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;
