'''Rhodri Paul Gilbert''' (born 18 October 1968) is a Welsh comedian who was nominated in 2005 for the [[Edinburgh Comedy Awards|Perrier Best Newcomer Award]]. In 2008, he was nominated for the main comedy award (as the Edinburgh Comedy Awards were then branded).&lt;ref name="if2008"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/specials/edinburgh/article4590885.ece |title=Why the if.comedy shortlist is intriguingly short |newspaper=The Times |date=24 August 2008 |accessdate=23 November 2009 |location=London, UK |first=Stephen |last=Armstrong |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gilbert appears on television and radio panel shows, has performed stand-up on the [[Royal Variety Performance]], and hosts a weekly show on [[BBC Radio Wales]].&lt;ref name="BBCWA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/arts/sites/rhod-gilbert/ |title=Rhod Gilbert |work=BBC Wales Arts |accessdate=23 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 September 2014, Gilbert started presenting the [[BBC Two]] panel show ''[[Never Mind the Buzzcocks]]'', ending a run of five series without a [[List of Never Mind the Buzzcocks presenters|permanent host]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/arts-ents/tv-radio/rhod-gilbert-unveiled-as-new-host-of-never-mind-the-buzzcocks.1404910903 |title=Rhod Gilbert unveiled as new host of Never Mind the Buzzcocks |newspaper=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]] |location=Glasgow |date=9 July 2014 |accessdate=9 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the show was axed by the BBC in May 2015.

==Personal life==
Gilbert was born in [[Carmarthen]], Wales, one of three siblings to two teacher parents. He attended [[Queen Elizabeth High School, Carmarthen|Maridunum Comprehensive School]] and went on to study languages at [[University of Exeter|Exeter University]].&lt;ref name="Stand Up"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCWA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TimeO2006"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.timeout.com/london/comedy/features/2140/Rhod_Gilbert-interview.html |title=Rhod Gilbert: interview |first=Malcolm |last=Hay |work=[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]] |date=16 October 2006|accessdate=23 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the first three weeks, such was his painful shyness that Gilbert was unable to eat with other students in the canteen or even make friends with the student in the next room.&lt;ref name="Stand Up"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/showbiz-and-lifestyle/showbiz/2010/01/16/would-the-real-rhod-gilbert-please-stand-up-91466-25602078/ |title=Would the real Rhod Gilbert please stand up |author=Correspondent |newspaper=[[Western Mail (Wales)|Western Mail]] |location=Cardiff |date=16 January 2010 |accessdate=19 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating, Gilbert travelled for a year and a half around Australia and Asia before returning to Carmarthen and working as an admin assistant for the [[Welsh Office]].&lt;ref name="Stand Up"/&gt; Gilbert later worked as a [[qualitative research]]er for several [[market research]] agencies in London.&lt;ref name="BBCWA"/&gt;

Gilbert married his long-term girlfriend, writer and comedian Sian Harries, in August 2013. They split their time between London and Wales.&lt;ref name="walesonline.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/whats-on/comedy-gigs/rhod-gilbert-im-turning-back-6209311 |title=Rhod Gilbert: Why I'm turning my back on stand-up comedy |first=Nathan |last=Bevan |work=[[Wales Online]] |date=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Stand-up comedy===
Gilbert got into professional comedy in 2002, after taking part in [[the Amused Moose]] Stand Up and Deliver course,&lt;ref name="asktheindustrypodcast.tumblr.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://asktheindustrypodcast.tumblr.com/post/103406217804/hils-jago |title=EP 01 - Hils Jago (Amused Moose) |work=Ask The Industry Podcast |accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://amusedmoose.com/comedy-courses/absolute-almost-beginners/ |title=Stand Up and Deliver |work=Amused Moose |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150201220734/http://amusedmoose.com/comedy-courses/absolute-almost-beginners/ |archivedate=1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but only "thanks to a girlfriend’s constant nagging".&lt;ref name="Stand Up"/&gt; Within 18 months, Gilbert had already won several different talent competitions&lt;ref name="TimeO2006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/comics/r/236/rhod_gilbert |title=Rhod Gilbert, comedian |work=[[Chortle (website)|Chortle]] |accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was nominated for the ''Perrier Newcomer'' award for his first solo show in 2005 at [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe|Edinburgh Fringe]] entitled ''1984.''&lt;ref name="TimeO2006"/&gt; He has since performed worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/profiles/2bzxNlYbMVK6v8DzxQq3fqd/rhod-gilbert |title=Rhod Gilbert |work=BBC Radio Wales}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of Gilbert's stories are drawn from real life events, and his life in the wholly fictionalised village of Llanbobl. In 2008, Gilbert wrote a sitcom about life in Llanbobl, which featured on [[BBC Radio 2]].&lt;ref name="LlanWM"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2008/03/24/how-rhod-is-aiming-to-put-llanbobl-on-the-map-91466-20665192/ |title=How Rhod is aiming to put Llanbobl on the map |newspaper=Western Mail|date=24 March 2008 |accessdate=23 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00g66s2 |title=Rhod Gilbert's Leaving Llanbobl |work=BBC Radio 2 |accessdate=23 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 2006 [[Edinburgh Fringe]] show ''Knocking on Heaven's Door'', Gilbert told stories from his life, weighing up whether he would be admitted to heaven. His 2007 show, ''Who's Eaten Gilbert's Grape?'' saw Gilbert return to Llanbobl and pick up the story following the ''1984'' show narrative. His 2008 show, ''Rhod Gilbert and the Award-Winning Mince Pie'', saw Gilbert question his sanity, his career and his life after suffering a mental breakdown brought on by the award-winning mince pie at a motorway services.

On 17 December 2008, he appeared at the 80th [[Royal Variety Performance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eabf.org.uk/royal-variety-performance/archive/2000s/2008 |title=London Palladium 2008 |work=[[Royal Variety Charity]] |accessdate=14 March 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100119011620/http://www.eabf.org.uk/royal-variety-performance/archive/2000s/2008 |archivedate=19 January 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 and 19 June 2009, Gilbert made the last performances of ''Rhod Gilbert and the Award-Winning Mince Pie'' show at the [[Bloomsbury Theatre]], which was recorded and released as a DVD on 16 November 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.play.com/DVD/DVD/4-/10267632/Rhod-Gilbert-And-The-Award-Winning-Mince-Pie/Product.html |work=Play.com |title=Rhod Gilbert And The Award-Winning Mince Pie |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100322230652/http://www.play.com/DVD/DVD/4-/10267632/Rhod-Gilbert-And-The-Award-Winning-Mince-Pie/Product.html |archivedate=22 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DVD also contains several special features, including his infamous rant about lost luggage, outtakes from the performance and a [[mockumentary]] called ''Back To Llanbobl'' in which Gilbert shows the viewer around his fictional home town.

Gilbert's 2009/10 show, entitled ''Rhod Gilbert and the Cat That Looked Like [[Nicholas Lyndhurst]]'', was announced on 5 April. The show previewed around the UK in small venues, before being performed at the Edinburgh Festival. The show toured UK theatres from September 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/shows/edinburgh_fringe_2009/r/16965/rhod_gilbert_and_the_cat_that_looked_like_nicholas_lyndhurst |title=Rhod Gilbert And The Cat That Looked Like Nicholas Lyndhurst's description |work=Chortle |accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tour included dates at many prestigious theatres such as London's HMV [[Hammersmith Apollo]]. A DVD of the tour was released on 15 November 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.play.com/DVD/DVD/4-/12538216/Rhod-Gilbert-And-The-Cat-That-Looked-Like-Nicholas-Lyndhurst/Product.html |work=Play.com |title=Rhod Gilbert And The Cat That Looked Like Nicholas Lyndhurst |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013162458/http://www.play.com/DVD/DVD/4-/12538216/Rhod-Gilbert-And-The-Cat-That-Looked-Like-Nicholas-Lyndhurst/Product.html |archivedate=13 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
