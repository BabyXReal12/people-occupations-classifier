Her frustration with the imperfect and ephemeral nature of [[improvisational theatre|improv]] and the encouragement from classmates got her to audit a stand-up class at the PIT.&lt;ref name=zarum/&gt; Her first appearance on late-night television was in July 2014, when she went on ''[[Late Night with Seth Meyers]]''. She re-appeared on numerous segments on ''Late Night'', often as her fictional persona, "Grown-Up Annie", an adult version of [[Little Orphan Annie]].
