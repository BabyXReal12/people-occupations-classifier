He has starred in several TV comedy series, including ''[[The State (1993 TV series)|The State]]'', ''[[Viva Variety]]'', ''[[Stella (U.S. TV series)|Stella]]'', ''[[Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp]]'', The Comedy Quarter-hour, ''[[Michael &amp; Michael Have Issues]]'', and ''[[Another Period]]''. He also appeared on ''[[Celebrity Poker Showdown]]'' several times. He released his first children's book, ''Chicken Cheeks'', in 2009, and has since released six more, in addition to four books for adults.

==Early life==
Black was born in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], to Jill and Robert Schwartz, a store owner and an executive, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/48/Michael-Ian-Black.html |title=Michael Ian Black Biography (1971-) |publisher=Filmreference.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; His family is [[Jewish]].&lt;ref name="haaretz"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zaltzman|first1=Lior|title=Jewish Comedian Donald Trump Children's Book Rubs Racists the Wrong Way|url=http://www.haaretz.com/jewish/features/1.726671|accessdate=June 12, 2017|work=[[Haaretz]]|date=June 23, 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up in [[Hillsborough Township, New Jersey]],&lt;ref&gt;Meoli, Daria. [http://www.njmonthly.com/issues/oct05/entertain.html "That’s Entertainment"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051214185336/http://www.njmonthly.com/issues/oct05/entertain.html |date=2005-12-14 }}, ''[[New Jersey Monthly]]'', October 2005.

"Add Stella, the strange Comedy Network brainchild of Princeton native Michael Showalter and Hillsborough native Michael Ian Black—he played wacky bowling-alley employee Phil in Ed, filmed all over the state—and Ohioan David Wain."&lt;/ref&gt; where he attended [[Hillsborough High School (New Jersey)|Hillsborough High School]]. His parents divorced when he was 3 years old; his mother, Jill, later came out as a lesbian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metroweekly.com/arts_entertainment/books.php?ak=7105 |title=Gay by Association: Michael Ian Black is an affiliated member of the gay community: Books section |publisher=[[Metro Weekly]] |date=2012-03-01 |accessdate=2013-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

His birth name, Schwartz, is derived from the German word ''schwarz'', which means black. He changed his name to Michael Ian Black to avoid confusion with the actor [[Mike Schwartz]].&lt;ref name="Black3"&gt;{{cite web|last=Black|first=Michael|title=Big Helium Dog|publisher=IMDB|date=1999-07-30|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0085438/bio|accessdate=2010-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===1991–2010===
Black began his career as a member of the comedy group ''[[The State (1993 TV series)|The State]]'' and was featured on the television show of the same name on [[MTV]]. He continued working with members of that group on the show ''[[Viva Variety]]'' in the role of "Johnny Bluejeans", and in the film ''[[Wet Hot American Summer]]''. 

Black also appeared on [[VH1]]'s ''[[I Love the]]...'' series, his comedy troupe [[Stella (comedy group)|Stella]], and in various TV series and films. He was also the [[voice actor]] for the [[Pets.com]] sock puppet, was featured in commercials for [[Sierra Mist]], hosted the first season of [[NBC]]'s hidden-camera show ''Spy TV'', made several appearances in the film ''[[Big Helium Dog]]'', and had a supporting role on the NBC [[dramedy]] ''[[Ed (TV series)|Ed]]''. 

His dry, [[sarcasm|sarcastically]] irreverent commentary on [[popular culture|pop culture]] artifacts on [[VH1]]'s ''[[I Love the '70s (U.S. TV series)|I Love the '70s]]/[[I Love the '80s (U.S. TV series)|'80s]]/[[I Love the '90s (U.S. TV series)|'90s]]/[[I Love the New Millennium|New Millennium]]'' series added to his and the shows' popularity. Black stated several times on the show that he felt as if he was "doomed to an eternity of doing the ''I Love the...'' series". He also made fun of himself for being a [[Jewish-American]] and sarcastically enforcing Jewish [[stereotypes]].

Black is a [[poker]] enthusiast and appeared in five episodes of ''[[Celebrity Poker Showdown]]'' beginning in 2003, playing for the Endeavor House charity. In 2004 and 2006 he played for the charity [[MAZON: A Jewish Response to Hunger]]. In 2006, he came in third (receiving $100,000 for his charity). Black was praised for his humor and his skilled poker play by [[Dave Foley]], host of ''Celebrity Poker Showdown'', and by poker experts [[Phil Gordon]] and [[Phil Hellmuth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hobotrashcan.com/interviews/philgordon2.php |title=Phil Gordon interview |publisher=HoboTrashcan |date=2006-03-14 |accessdate=2013-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pokernews.com/news/2006/5/phil-hellmuth-businessman-poker-legend.htm |title=Phil Hellmuth - Businessman, Host, and Poker Legend |publisher=Poker News |date=2006-05-16 |accessdate=2013-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the latter part of 2004, he acted as guest host of [[CBS]]'s ''[[The Late Late Show (CBS TV series)|The Late Late Show]]'' while auditioning for the permanent hosting role. He was a finalist for the position, but the job eventually went to [[Craig Ferguson]]. He is also an occasional contributor to the online edition of [[McSweeney's]], where he writes a column titled "Michael Ian Black Is a Very Famous Celebrity".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mcsweeneys.net/links/black/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526074722/http://www.mcsweeneys.net/links/black/ |date=May 26, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Black, along with fellow ''State'' members [[Michael Showalter]] and [[David Wain]], co-starred in and cowrote the [[Comedy Central]] series ''[[Stella (U.S. TV series)|Stella]]'', a television adaptation of their popular stage show. The ten-episode first season debuted in June 2005 and was not renewed for a second season.

Black wrote the screenplays for two feature film comedies —''[[Wedding Daze]]'' (2006) and ''[[Run, Fat Boy, Run]]'' (2007, co-written with leading actor [[Simon Pegg]]).&lt;ref&gt;BBC Movies Review of ''Run, Fatboy, Run''[http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2007/09/03/run_fat_boy_run_2007_review.shtml]. Retrieved on September 14, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Black also directed ''Wedding Daze'' which stars [[Jason Biggs]], [[Joe Pantoliano]], and [[Isla Fisher]].&lt;ref&gt;The Internet Movie Database, ''The Pleasure of Your Company''[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0484877/] retrieved on September 14, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Black also has some minor screen credits. He appeared twice on the [[Adult Swim]] show ''[[Tom Goes to the Mayor]]'', was a guest voice on [[Seth Green]]'s stop-motion show ''[[Robot Chicken]]'', and later did a bit for ''[[Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!]]''. He appeared on the [[Comedy Central]] shows ''[[Crank Yankers]]'' and ''[[Reno 911!]]''. He had a cameo in [[David Wain]]'s 2007 film ''[[The Ten]]'' as a prison guard. In September 2007, he released his first stand-up comedy album, ''I Am a Wonderful Man''. In addition, he starred on the TV series ''[[Reaper (TV series)|Reaper]]'' as a [[gay]] [[demon]] trying to destroy [[the devil]] through acts of kindness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.readexpress.com/read_freeride/2007/12/happy_reaper_michael_ian_black.php Happy Reaper: Michael Ian Black] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416153302/http://www.readexpress.com/read_freeride/2007/12/happy_reaper_michael_ian_black.php |date=April 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Black published a book titled ''My Custom Van ...

His first children's book, ''Chicken Cheeks'', was published by [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] Children's Publishing on January 6, 2009. The book is illustrated by Kevin Hawkes. In a starred review, [[Kirkus Reviews|Kirkus]] called the book "a perfect collaboration of text and illustration."

On February 21, 2009, Black instigated a "Celeb-Feud" — or as he called it, the "World's First [[Twitter]] War" — with [[LeVar Burton]] to see if he could muster more Twitter followers than Burton.

In 2013, he and [[Michael Showalter]] launched the [[podcast]] ''Topics'' in which they discuss evergreen topics in a serious manner, although if something funny comes up, it's OK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earwolf.com/show/topics/ |title=Topics Podcast at EarWolf.com|publisher=Ear Wolf |date= |accessdate=2015-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alongside [[Jason Ritter]], [[Alexis Bledel]], and [[Kerri Kenney-Silver]], Black appeared in the unaired 2013 Fox sitcom ''[[Us &amp; Them]]'', a 13-episode US adaptation of the hit UK sitcom ''[[Gavin &amp; Stacey]]'', which was canceled while the seventh episode was in production.
