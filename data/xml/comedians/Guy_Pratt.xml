R. Rahman]]. In addition to his work as a session musician, Pratt has been a member of the Australian rock band [[Icehouse (band)|Icehouse]], and is currently a member of the [[electronica]] band [[Transit Kings]] with [[Alex Paterson]] (of [[The Orb]]), [[Jimmy Cauty]] (of [[the KLF]]), and Dom Beken. Pratt and Cauty also released the single "[[I Wanna 1-2-1 With You]]" as [[Solid Gold Chartbusters]].&lt;ref name="discogs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Solid+Gold+Chartbusters|title=Solid Gold Chartbusters|publisher=[[Discogs]]|accessdate=25 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pratt has also been an actor and worked on TV and film soundtracks, including ''[[Dick Tracy (1990 film)|Dick Tracy]]'' (1990), ''[[Last Action Hero]]'' (1993), ''[[Hackers (film)|Hackers]]'' (1995), ''[[Still Crazy]]'' (1998) and ''[[Johnny English Reborn]]'' (2011). In 2005 he debuted a one-man music and comedy show.

==Early years==
Guy Pratt was born on 3 January 1962, in a flat above a shop on the street [[The Cut, London|The Cut]], in [[Lambeth]], [[South London]], England. His father, [[Mike Pratt (actor)|Mike Pratt]], was an actor, songwriter and screenwriter but died when Guy was 14. He worked for a while as a graphic designer, but then decided to concentrate on a music career. In 1981, aged 19, Pratt was asked to tour with [[Icehouse (band)|Icehouse]]. Two years later as a member of Icehouse he supported [[David Bowie]] on his [[Serious Moonlight Tour]], which was Bowie's longest, largest, and most successful concert tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Flippo | first=Chet | title=David Bowie's Serious Moonlight : The World Tour | publisher=Doubleday &amp; Company, Inc. | date=1984 | isbn=0-385-19265-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to other engagements including a stint with [[Pink Floyd]]. He also spent some time in [[Los Angeles]] where he played with [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] and [[Michael Jackson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.guypratt.com/bio|title=biography|accessdate=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In 1986 [[the Smiths]]' bassist [[Andy Rourke]] was arrested on drug possession charges shortly before the band was scheduled to leave for its North American tour in support of ''[[The Queen Is Dead]]''. Expecting that Rourke would thus be denied work [[Travel visa|visas]] for the U.S. and Canada, the band's guitarist, [[Johnny Marr]], asked Pratt to step in. He spent nearly two weeks with Rourke and the band, learning bass lines and rehearsing, but shortly before the band was to leave Britain Rourke received his visas, and there was no need for Pratt to go.&lt;ref name="Tony Fletcher book"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fletcher|first1=Tony|authorlink1=Tony Fletcher|title=A Light That Never Goes Out: The Enduring Saga of the Smiths|date=2013|publisher=Windmill Books|location=London|isbn=9780099537922|pages=522–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pratt came to prominence when he was chosen to play bass for Pink Floyd's post-[[Roger Waters]] [[A Momentary Lapse of Reason Tour]] in 1987–90, and [[The Division Bell Tour]] in 1994. He co-performed the lead vocals on "[[Run Like Hell]]", "[[Another Brick in the Wall|Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2]]", "[[Us and Them (song)|Us and Them]]" and "[[Comfortably Numb]]" with Gilmour during the live shows. He also played bass on several tracks on ''[[The Division Bell]]''. [[Tony Levin]] had performed all of the bass parts on ''[[A Momentary Lapse of Reason]]''; Pratt replaced him on the later tour owing to Levin's unavailability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=thodoris |url=http://www.hit-channel.com/tony-levin-stick-menking-crimsonpeter-gabrieljohn-lennon/34535 |title=Interview:Tony Levin (Stick Men,King Crimson,Peter Gabriel,John Lennon) |publisher=Hit-channel.com |date=21 February 2013 |accessdate=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="book"&gt;{{cite book

Pratt played bass on Gary Moore's ''[[Dark Days in Paradise]]'' tour in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;http://garymoorefc.com/media_radio&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides working as a bass player, Pratt is a songwriter and composes music for TV and film. As a songwriter, Pratt co-wrote the UK number-one hit "[[Ain't No Doubt]]" by [[Jimmy Nail]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Roberts, David|date=2006|title=British Hit Singles &amp; Albums (19th ed.)|publisher=Guinness World Records Limited|page=542}}&lt;/ref&gt; He produced, co-wrote and played bass, guitar and keyboards on the music for the 1998 [[Channel 4]] drama series ''[[The Young Person's Guide to Becoming a Rock Star]]''. With regular collaborator Dom Beken, he provided the theme music to ''[[Spaced]]'', where he also appeared as the character Minty. Pratt also acted in ''[[Linda Green]]'' and appeared in an episode of the remake of ''[[Randall &amp; Hopkirk (Deceased) (2000 TV series)|Randall &amp; Hopkirk]]'', starring [[Vic and Bob|Vic Reeves and Bob Mortimer]]. Pratt's father Mike had played the part of [[Jeff Randall]] in the original 1960s series. Pratt also plays as a regular in the backing band for the [[BBC Radio 2]] musical comedy show ''[[Jammin' (radio programme)|Jammin']]'' with [[Rowland Rivron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.radiolistings.co.uk/programmes/j/ja/jammin_.html|title=Jammin|accessdate=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pratt's one-man music and comedy show, ''My Bass &amp; Other Animals'', debuted in August 2005 at the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]]; this led to his book of the same name, published in May 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://forbassplayersonly.com/guy-pratt|title=Guy Pratt: Exclusive interview with FBPO’s Jon Liebman|date=3 August 2015|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/arts/article2402004.ece|title=Flying Solo|author=Jelbert, Steve|publisher=The Times, Body &amp; Soul|date=12 August 2005|page=11|accessdate=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pratt spent 2011 performing stand-up in Switzerland, Australia, and at the Edinburgh Fringe, as well as on a South American tour playing bass guitar for [[Dominic Miller]].

In April 2010, Pratt joined Argentine band The End Pink Floyd, with [[Durga McBroom]] and [[Jon Carin]], in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Pratt joined the [[Australian Pink Floyd Show]] on stage on 13 June 2011 for the [[Hampton Court Palace Festival]] for the song "Run Like Hell". He joined the UK Pink Floyd cover band [[Brit Floyd]] on stage on 9 November 2013 as a special guest during the Liverpool leg of their ''[[Pulse (Pink Floyd album)|Pulse]]'' tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/music/inside-brit-floyd-the-ambitious-pink-floyd-cover-band-6600917|title=Inside Brit Floyd, the ambitions Pink Floyd cover band|author=Burnsilver, Genn|date=23 May 2014|accessdate=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He performed on the songs "[[One of These Days (instrumental)|One of These Days]]", "Comfortably Numb" and shared lead vocals with the band's lead singer Damian Darlington during the finale of "Run Like Hell".

==Equipment==
Pratt's standard bass guitar arsenal includes a selection of various vintage [[Fender Precision Bass|Fender Precision]] and [[Fender Jazz Bass|Jazz Basses]], three [[Music Man StingRay]] 4-strings (black with rosewood fretboard and black pickguard, black with maple fretboard and white pickguard, natural with maple fretboard and black pickguard), a pair of headless Status 4 and 5-strings (fretless and fretted) and an amber [[Spector|Stuart Spector]] NS2.

During [[David Gilmour]]'s On an Island Tour, he mainly used a 3-colour sunburst 1961 Fender Precision, a burgundy mist 1963 Fender Jazz named 'Betsy', a Status Vintage GP Signature and a [[Framus]] Triumph electric upright bass. On Gilmour's ''[[Live in Gdańsk]]'' DVD he is seen playing his Fender Jazz and Precision Basses as well as a Candy Apple Red [[Lakland]] [[Joe Osborn]] signature fretless Jazz Bass and a [[Rickenbacker 4001]]. On the studio jamming sessions included in the DVD, he played several Fender Jazz Basses, a Hofner Icon bass and a Ned Steinberger Design CR electric upright.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://home.comcast.net/~jroscoe/guypratt.html|title=Q &amp; A with Guy Pratt|accessdate=22 September 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151002171311/http://home.comcast.net/~jroscoe/guypratt.html|archivedate=2 October 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His [[amplifier|amps]] are usually Ashdown ABM heads and Ashdown ABM 810 Cabinets, although when playing with Gilmour they are [[Watkins Electric Music|WEM]]-badged to match Gilmour's cabinets.

==Awards==
Pratt won a [[Grammy Award]] in 1995 for "[[Marooned (instrumental)|Marooned]]", an instrumental track on Pink Floyd's 1994 album ''[[The Division Bell]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/03/arts/the-1995-grammy-winners.html|title=The 1995 Grammy Winners|publisher=The New York Times|date=3 March 1995|accessdate=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also been nominated for two [[Ivor Novello Awards]] and was awarded an [[ARIA Music Awards|ARIA Award]] for his work with Icehouse.
