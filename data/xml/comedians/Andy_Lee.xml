'''Andrew Thomas''' "'''Andy'''" '''Lee''' (born 24 May 1981) is an Australian comedian, musician and children's writer. He is known for working alongside [[Hamish Blake]] as part of the [[comedy duo]] [[Hamish &amp; Andy]]. 

==Personal life==
Andy Lee is the middle child of Michael and Margaret Lee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/comment/radio-prankster-andy-lees-mum-gets-thumbs-up-on-twitter-20150820-gj4ck8.html|title=Radio prankster Andy Lee's mum gets thumbs up on Twitter|first=Lawrence|last=Money|date=23 August 2015|work=The Age}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lee has a sister, Alex Miles, who writes pantomimes and stars in the comedy show Porky Pies. He also has an older brother, Cameron, with whom Lee started the band Zoophyte.

Lee attended Balwyn Primary School and [[Camberwell Grammar School|CGS (Camberwell Grammar School)]]. He was also a member of the Scouting Movement, performing in Camberwell Showtime and Melbourne Gang Show. He then went on to study Commerce at the [[University of Melbourne]], where he met comedic partner [[Hamish Blake]] in 2001.

In 2006, Lee was announced as Cleo's Bachelor of the Year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/andy-lee-bachelor-of-the-year/story-e6frfmyi-1111112216174|title=Andy Lee bachelor of the year|website=news.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lee previously dated [[Megan Gale]]. They ended their relationship in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/celebrity/andy-lee-and-megan-gale-split-up-20101214-18x5c.html|title=Andy Lee and Megan Gale split up|date=15 December 2010|work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015, it was announced that Lee was dating model and PR Graduate, Rebecca Harding. Their break-up was confirmed by Lee in July 2016. They were reported to have reconciled a few months later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Andy Lee back with ex-girlfriend | first = Jackie | last = Epstein | work = Herald Sun | date = 6 December 2016 | accessdate = 25 December 2016 | url = http://www.heraldsun.com.au/entertainment/confidential/andy-lee-back-with-exgirlfriend-rebecca-harding/news-story/3ee4cc54ae25be5b783bece8fa950beb }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Hamish &amp; Andy===
{{Main|Hamish &amp; Andy}}
[[File:Hamish &amp; Andy - 2009 ARIA Awards.jpg|thumb|Lee (left) and Blake (right) at the 2009 ARIA Awards]]

Lee and Blake teamed with [[Ryan Shelton]] and several others to create a show called ''Radio Karate'' for [[RMIT University]]'s student television company [[RMITV]], on community-access television station [[Channel 31 (Australia)|Channel 31]]. They also trained with, and appeared on, RMIT's student radio station [[Student Youth Network|SYN]], and subsequently had a few spot projects on [[FOX FM (Melbourne)|FOX FM]].

Lee and Blake then hosted a comedy programme on Australia's [[Seven Network]], ''The Hamish and Andy Show'', which was shortly cancelled after bad ratings. Critics acknowledged their talent, but panned the show as poorly executed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/culture/hamish-amp-andy/2007/04/02/1175366136794.html?page=4|title=Hamish &amp; Andy|website=www.theage.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since this show, Lee and Blake have almost always performed together. They are now consistently referred to as ''Hamish &amp; Andy''.

Blake and Lee hosted the national ([[Hit Network]]) drive-time program [[Hamish &amp; Andy (radio show)]] that ran between 4&amp;nbsp;pm and 6&amp;nbsp;pm, Monday to Friday. In 2011, the program was cut back to a weekly Friday show due to wanting to pursue other opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.mediaspy.org/report/2010/08/25/hamish-and-andy-quitting-daily-radio-show/| title=The Spy Report: Hamish and Andy quitting daily radio show| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101104015412/http://www.mediaspy.org/report/2010/08/25/hamish-and-andy-quitting-daily-radio-show/ |archive-date=4 November 2010| dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The radio show is considered successful, scoring top positions in the radio ratings in the crucial Sydney and [[Melbourne]] markets, as well as [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]].&lt;ref name=austereo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austereo.com.au/docs/survey/Release8-2007.pdf|title=Southern Cross Austereo - Absolutely Engaging|website=www.austereo.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their audience share is around 20%, which is the highest ever recorded for a national FM show in Australia.&lt;ref name=austereo/&gt;

Lee won the first series of ''Joker Poker'', a celebrity poker show in which contestants win money for charity. He appeared on the [[Network Ten]] program ''Australia's Brainiest Comedian''.

He was selected as one of the entrants to the [[Who's Who in Australia]] 2011 edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who's Who pack now boasts Siddle, Hamish and Andy and the Masterchef judges|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/breaking-news/whos-who-pack-now-boasts-siddle-hamish-and-andy-and-the-masterchef-judges/story-e6frf7jx-1225968131634|publisher=heraldsun.com.au|date=9 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 May 2010, Andy and Hamish appeared on the TV show ''[[Good News Week]]''.

In 2011 the duo made a deal with Channel Nine, since they have created a ten-part series called Gap Year: New York. In 2012, the comedy duo created a second Gap Year season, titled Hamish and Andy's: Euro Gap Year, in which the two travelled throughout Europe leading up to the 2012 London Olympic Games. In 2013, they continued the Gap Year series, creating a third season titled, Hamish and Andy's: Asia Gap Year.

===Solo work===
Lee was a founding member of [[Melbourne]] band Zoophyte, along with his brother Cameron. In 2007,  Lee had retired from the band due to other commitments, but occasionally appears as a guest at gigs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Moran |first=Jonathon |url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/insider/andy-shows-another-side/story-e6frewt9-1111113337291 |title=Andy Shows Another Side &amp;#124; thetelegraph.com.au |publisher=Dailytelegraph.com.au |date=15 April 2007 |accessdate=22 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Lee formed [[Coolboys and the Frontman]] with comedic partner Hamish Blake and producer Jack Post.  

Lee released an educational times table CD in 2003, ''The Sing Along Times Table CD Book''. The CD was re-discovered in 2005/2006 after an "alert listener" informed Blake, and teased Lee about it on their radio show.{{citation needed|date=August 2009}}
