'''Freddie James Prinze''' (born '''Frederick Karl Pruetzel'''; June 22, 1954 – January 29, 1977) was an American stand-up comedian and actor. Prinze was the star of [[NBC|NBC-TV]] sitcom ''[[Chico and the Man]]'' from 1974 until his death in 1977. Prinze is the father of actor [[Freddie Prinze Jr.]]

==Early life==
Prinze was born Frederick Karl Pruetzel ([[German language|German spelling]]: Prützel) in [[New York City]], the son of Edward Karl Pruetzel (1914–1979) and Maria Graniela Pruetzel (1918–1994). His mother was [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]] and his father was a [[Germans|German]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0697905/bio Freddie Prinze], IMDb-Biography&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lutheran]] [[Immigration|immigrant]] who had arrived in the U.S. as a youth in 1934.&lt;ref name="catalano"&gt;{{cite book|title=Freddie Prinze Jr.: He's All That|first=Grace|last=Catalano|publisher=Bantam Doubleday Dell Books for Young Readers|year=1999|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prinze was raised in a mixed neighborhood in [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]], [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;Nordheimer, Jon. [https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0F16F83E5D167493CBAB178AD85F438785F9 "Freddie Prinze Wounded in Head; Police Say TV Star Shot Himself; PRINZE, THE TV STAR, IS WOUNDED IN HEAD"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', January 29, 1977. Accessed June 11, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; When Prinze was a small child, his mother enrolled him in [[ballet]] classes to deal with a weight problem. Without telling his parents, Prinze successfully auditioned for the [[Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School|LaGuardia High School of Performing Arts]], where he was introduced to drama and continued ballet — and where he discovered his gift for comedy while entertaining crowds in the boys' restroom. He dropped out of school in his senior year to become a stand-up comedian.
==Career==
[[File:Chico and the man.JPG|thumb|left|Prinze (right) with [[Jack Albertson]] on ''[[Chico and the Man]]'', 1976.]]
Prinze worked at several [[comedy club]]s in [[New York City]], including [[The Improv]] and [[Catch a Rising Star (comedy clubs)|Catch a Rising Star]], where he introduced himself to audiences as a "Hunga-rican" (part Hungarian, part Puerto Rican), despite the fact that his father was a German immigrant of no Hungarian ancestry, and his mother was of Puerto Rican ancestry. Prinze's son Freddie, Jr has stated that his father was half German/half Puerto Rican many times. This is also verified by Census records, as well as Prützel/Pruetzel family accounts. For the sake of his budding comedic career, he changed his surname to "Prinze". He chose this name because, according to his friend [[David Brenner]], Prinze originally wanted to be known as the ''King'' of comedy but [[Alan King (comedian)|Alan King]] already had that last name and sobriquet, so he would be the ''Prince'' of comedy instead. During 1973, Prinze made his first television appearance on one of the last episodes of ''[[Jack Paar]] Tonite''. In December 1973, his biggest break came with an appearance on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]''. Prinze was the first young comedian to be asked to have a sit-down chat with Carson on his first appearance. Prinze appeared on and guest-hosted ''The Tonight Show'' on several other occasions. He also appeared on'' [[The Midnight Special (TV series)|The Midnight Special]]'' to perform his comic routine.

From September 1974 until his death in January 1977, Prinze starred as Francisco "Chico" Rodriguez in the [[NBC]] TV series ''[[Chico and the Man]]'' with [[Jack Albertson]]. The show was an instant hit. Prinze made several appearances on ''[[The Dean Martin Celebrity Roast]]s'', most notably the roasts for [[Sammy Davis Jr.]] and [[Muhammad Ali]]. In 1975, he released a comedy album that was taped live at Mr. Kelly's in [[Chicago]] titled ''Looking Good''—his catch phrase from ''Chico and the Man''. In 1976, he starred in a [[television movie|made-for-TV movie]], ''[[The Million Dollar Rip-Off]]''. Prinze had a little-known talent for singing, examples of which could be heard in the background of the title song of the [[Tony Orlando and Dawn]] album ''To Be With You'', in his appearances on their variety show, and on rare occasions on his own [[Situation comedy|sitcom]]. About four months before his death, Prinze had signed a multi-year deal with [[NBC]] worth $6 million over five years.
==Personal life==
[[File:Freddie Prinze Tony Orlando Chico and the Man 1976.JPG|thumb|right|Prinze (right) with [[Tony Orlando]] on ''[[Chico and the Man]]'', 1976.]]
Prinze married Katherine (Kathy) Elaine (Barber) Cochran on October 13, 1975, with whom he had one child, son [[Freddie Prinze Jr]]., who was born March 8, 1976. Prinze was arrested for [[driving under the influence]] of [[Methaqualone|Quaaludes]] on November 16, 1976. A few weeks later his wife filed for [[divorce]]. Prinze had been romantically linked to actress [[Pam Grier]]&lt;ref name=VIB3/&gt;, after they met in 1973.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/05/books/05grier.html|title=Pam Grier’s Collection of Lessons Learned|last=Lee|first=Felicia R.|date=May 4, 2010|website=New York Times|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grier recalls their relationship in chapter nineteen of her autobiographical memoir, ''My Life in Three Acts''.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Foxy: My Life in Three Acts|last=Grier|first=Pam|publisher=Springboard|year=2010|isbn=9780446548502|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prinze was very close friends with singer [[Tony Orlando]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.cbn.com/music/tony-orlando%27s-brush-with-death |title=Tony Orlando's Brush With Death |website=[[Christian Broadcasting Network]] |first=Scott |last=Ross |accessdate=March 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orlando appeared on ''Chico and the Man'', and Prinze appeared on Orlando's variety show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://filmthreat.com/uncategorized/the-bootleg-files-chico-and-the-man/ |title=The Bootleg Files: Chico and the Man |website=filmthreat.com |date=October 31, 2014 |accessdate=March 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As he started to make more money, Prinze took [[martial arts]] lessons from [[Robert Wall]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/18735185/marilyn_beck_column/ |title=Marilyn Beck (column) |first=Marilyn |last=Beck |newspaper=[[Orlando Sentinel]] |page=110 |date=December 10, 1975 |accessdate=March 29, 2018 |via=newspaper.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; a student of [[Bruce Lee]], who appeared in ''[[Enter the Dragon]]'' and ''[[Way of the Dragon|Return of the Dragon]]''. Soon after, Wall became [[Godparent|godfather]] to Prinze's newborn son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/18735159/martial_arts_master_went_toe_to_toe/ |title=Martial arts master went toe to toe with greatest |newspaper=[[Albuquerque Journal]] |page=48 |date=August 5, 2011 |accessdate=March 29, 2018 |via=newspaper.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Death==
Prinze suffered from [[Depression (mood)|depression]], which deepened in the weeks after his wife filed for divorce. On the night of January 28, 1977, after talking on the telephone with his estranged wife, Prinze received a visit from his business manager, Marvin "Dusty" Snyder. With Snyder looking on, Prinze put a gun to his head and shot himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,914757-1,00.html|title=Freddie Prinze: Too Much, Too Soon|newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=February 7, 1977|accessdate=20 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prinze was rushed to the [[UCLA Medical Center]] to be placed on [[life support]] following emergency surgery. His family removed him from life support, and he died at 1 p.m. on January 29.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/18734066/freddie_prinze_buried_on_hill/ |title=Freddie Prinze buried on hill overlooking NBC studio |first=Vernon |last=Scott |agency=[[United Press International|UPI]] |newspaper=The Capitol Journal |location=[[Salem, Oregon]] |page=6 |date=January 31, 1977 |accessdate=March 29, 2018 |via=newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, the death was ruled a [[suicide]]. However, in 1983 in a civil case brought by his mother, a jury found that his death was medication-induced and accidental, which enabled the family to receive a significant life insurance settlement.&lt;ref&gt;Snauffer, Douglas (July 23, 2008).

His son Freddie Prinze Jr., who was less than one year old when his father died, did not speak publicly about it until he discussed it in the documentary ''Misery Loves Comedy'' (2015), directed by [[Kevin Pollak]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comingsoon.net/movies/features/432941-interview-kevin-pollak-tells-us-why-misery-loves-comedy |title=Interview: Kevin Pollak Tells Us Why Misery Loves Comedy |first=Max |last=Evry |website=comingsoon.net |date=April 23, 2015 |accessdate=March 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Legacy==
Prinze's mother wrote a book about her son, ''The Freddie Prinze Story'' (1978). ''Can You Hear the Laughter: The Story of Freddie Prinze'' (September 1979) is a TV biopic. Prinze's life and death were a focal point of one of the storylines in the movie ''[[Fame (1980 film)|Fame]]'' (1980), set in Prinze's alma mater, the LaGuardia High School of Performing Arts. In 2001, [[TV Land]] began showing [[rerun]]s of ''[[Chico and the Man]]''. Prinze received a star on the [[Hollywood Walk Of Fame]] on December 14, 2004, honoring his contribution to the television industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.walkoffame.com/freddie-prinze|title=Freddie Prinze {{!}} Hollywood Walk of Fame|website=www.walkoffame.com|access-date=2016-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/freddie-prinze/|title=Freddie Prinze – Hollywood Star Walk – Los Angeles Times|website=projects.latimes.com|access-date=2016-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actor and comedian [[George Lopez]] has acknowledged that he paid for Prinze's star.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://theexaminer.com/features/artist-interviews/getting-personal-george-lopez |title=Getting personal with George Lopez |first=Chad |last=Cooper |newspaper=[[The Examiner (Beaumont)|The Examiner]] |location=[[Beaumont, Texas]] |date=August 8, 2012 |accessdate=March 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
