'''Mary Tyler Moore''' (December 29, 1936 – January 25, 2017) was an American actress, known for her roles in the television [[sitcom]]s ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'' (1970–1977), in which she starred as [[Mary Richards]], a single woman working as a local news producer in [[Minneapolis]], and ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]'' (1961–1966), in which she played [[The Dick Van Dyke Show#Characters|Laura Petrie]], a former dancer turned [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] homemaker, wife and mother.&lt;ref&gt;Kohen, Yael.

Due to her roles on both ''The Mary Tyler Moore Show'' and ''The Dick Van Dyke Show'', in which her characters often broke from stereotypical images of women and pushed gender norms, Moore became a cultural icon and served as an inspiration for many younger actresses, professional women, and feminists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2017/01/25/how-mary-tyler-moore-changed-america-with-feminism-tv-and-comedy.html|title=How Mary Tyler Moore Changed America With Feminism, TV, and Comedy|first=Tim|last=Teeman|date=January 25, 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/sexes/archive/2013/05/the-real-feminist-impact-of-i-the-mary-tyler-moore-show-i-was-behind-the-scenes/275875/|title=The Real Feminist Impact of 'The Mary Tyler Moore Show' Was Behind the Scenes|first=Hope|last=Reese|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2017/jan/25/mary-tyler-moore-appreciation-true-icon-feminism|title=Mary Tyler Moore: a true cultural icon who changed the face of television|first=John|last=Patterson|date=January 25, 2017|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was later active in charity work and various political causes, particularly the issues of [[animal rights]], [[vegetarianism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Moore|1995|pp=27-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[diabetes mellitus type 1|diabetes]].

====Early appearances====

Moore decided at age 17 that she wanted to be a dancer. Her television career began with Moore's first job as "Happy Hotpoint", a tiny elf dancing on [[Hotpoint]] [[home appliance|appliances]] in [[television commercial|TV commercials]] during the 1950s series ''[[The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet|Ozzie and Harriet]]''.&lt;ref name="AA61-65" /&gt; After appearing in 39 Hotpoint commercials in five days, she received approximately $6,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The TV Guide TV Book: 40 Years of the All-Time Greatest Television Facts, Fads, Hits, and History|last=Weiner|first=Ed|author2=Editors of TV Guide|year=1992|publisher=Harper Collins|location=New York|isbn=0-06-096914-8|page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; She became pregnant while still working as "Happy" and Hotpoint ended her work when it was too difficult to conceal her pregnancy with the elf costume.&lt;ref name=AA61-65&gt;{{harvnb|Moore|1995|pp=61–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moore modeled anonymously on the covers of a number of record albums and auditioned for the role of the older daughter of [[Danny Thomas]] for his long-running TV show, but was turned down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Mural of Album Cover Art: Narrative Guide|url=http://www.vinylrecordday.com/pdf/mural_narrativeguide.pdf|publisher=Vinyl Record Day|accessdate=26 January 2017|page=4|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Van Dyke"/&gt; Much later, Thomas explained that "she missed it by a nose... no daughter of mine could ever have a nose that small."&lt;ref name="Van Dyke"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Van Dyke|first1=Dick|title=My Lucky Life In and Out of Show Business: A Memoir|date=2011|publisher=Crown Archetype|isbn=9780307592262|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZRvfn1BCoHwC&amp;pg=PT79&amp;lpg=PT79&amp;dq=no+daughter+of+mine+could+have+that+nose+Mary+Moore#v=onepage&amp;q=no%20daughter%20of%20mine%20could%20have%20that%20nose%20Mary%20Moore&amp;f=false|accessdate=January 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moore's first regular television role was as a mysterious and glamorous telephone receptionist on ''[[Richard Diamond, Private Detective]]''. On the show, Moore's voice was heard, but only her legs appeared on camera, adding to the character's mystique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/tyler-moore-dick-36447.aspx|title=Mary Tyler Moore's Big Break |publisher=Tvguide.com|date=May 6, 2004 |accessdate=August 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; About this time, she guest-starred on [[John Cassavetes]]'s [[NBC]] detective series ''[[Johnny Staccato]]''. She also guest-starred in ''[[Bachelor Father (U.S. TV series)|Bachelor Father]]'' in the episode titled "Bentley and the Big Board". In 1960, she was featured in two episodes of the [[William Bendix]]-[[Doug McClure]] NBC [[Western (genre)|western]] series, ''[[Overland Trail (TV series)|Overland Trail]]'' and several months later in the first episode of NBC's one-season ''[[The Tab Hunter Show]]'', a [[sitcom]] starring the former teen idol as a bachelor cartoonist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Tab Hunter Show|url=http://www.tvobscurities.com/articles/tab_hunter_show/|publisher=Television Obscurities|accessdate=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961, Moore appeared in several big parts in movies and on television, including ''[[Bourbon Street Beat]]'', ''[[77 Sunset Strip]]'', ''[[Surfside 6]]'', ''[[Wanted Dead or Alive (TV series)|Wanted: Dead or Alive]]'', ''[[Steve Canyon]]'', ''[[Hawaiian Eye]]'', ''[[Thriller (U.S. TV series)|Thriller]]'' and ''[[Lock-Up (TV series)|Lock-Up]]''.

====''The Dick Van Dyke Show'' (1961–1966)====

In 1961, [[Carl Reiner]] cast Moore in ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]'', a weekly series based on Reiner's own life and career as a writer for [[Sid Caesar]]'s television [[variety show]] ''[[Your Show of Shows]]'', telling the cast from the outset that it would run for no more than five years. The show was produced by [[Danny Thomas]]' company, and Thomas himself recommended her. He remembered Moore as "the girl with three names" whom he had turned down earlier.&lt;ref name=paley&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070301201915/http://www.shemadeit.org/meet/biography.aspx?m=43 Profile] the [[Paley Center for Media]]. Retrieved April 3, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Moore's energetic comic performances as Van Dyke's character's wife, begun at age 24 (11 years Van Dyke's junior), made both the actress and her signature tight capri pants extremely popular, and she became internationally known. When she won her first [[Emmy Award]] for her portrayal of Laura Petrie,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Moore|1995|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; she said, "I know this will never happen again".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/mary-tyler-moore-star-mary-tyler-moore-show/story?id=44534207|title=Mary Tyler Moore, Star of 'The Mary Tyler Moore Show,' Dies at 80|last=Fisher|first=Lucina|date=2017-01-25|website=ABC News|publisher=|access-date=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''The Mary Tyler Moore Show'' (1970–1977)====

In 1970, after having appeared earlier in a pivotal one-hour musical special called ''Dick Van Dyke and the Other Woman'', Moore and husband [[Grant Tinker]] successfully pitched a sitcom centered on Moore to [[CBS]]. ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'' is a half-hour newsroom sitcom featuring [[Ed Asner]] as her gruff boss [[Lou Grant (fictional character)|Lou Grant]]. Moore's show proved so popular that three other regular characters, [[Valerie Harper]] as [[Rhoda (TV series)|Rhoda Morgenstern]], [[Cloris Leachman]] as [[Phyllis (TV series)|Phyllis Lindstrom]] and [[Ed Asner]] as [[Lou Grant (TV series)|Lou Grant]] were also spun off into their own series. The premise of the single working woman's life, alternating during the program between work and home, became a television staple.&lt;ref name=paley/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/mary-tyler-moore-9413674|title=Mary Tyler Moore Biography |publisher=Biography.com |accessdate=February 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Retrieved April 3, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; the show slipped to number 39 during season seven.&lt;ref name="Comediennes"/&gt; Producers decided to cancel the series because of falling ratings, afraid that the show's legacy might be damaged if it were renewed for another season.&lt;ref name="Comediennes"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Littleton|first1=Darryl|last2=Littleton|first2=Tuezdae|title=Comediennes: Laugh Be a Lady|date=2012|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|isbn=9781480329744|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Iz_S7n9bWW8C&amp;pg=PT77&amp;lpg=PT77&amp;dq=The+Mary+Tyler+Moore+Show+%22season+seven%22#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Mary%20Tyler%20Moore%20Show%20%22season%20seven%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the decline in ratings, the 1977 season would go on to win an [[Emmy Award]] for Outstanding Comedy Series,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/mary-tyler-moore|title=Mary Tyler Moore – Television Academy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to add to the awards it had won in 1975 and 1976.

====Later projects====
[[File:Mary Tyler Moore - 1978.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|Moore in 1978]]

During season six of ''The Mary Tyler Moore Show'', Moore appeared in a musical/variety special for CBS titled ''Mary's Incredible Dream'',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Moore|1995|pp=190–192}}&lt;/ref&gt; which featured [[Ben Vereen]]. In 1978, she starred in a second CBS special, ''How to Survive the '70s and Maybe Even Bump Into Happiness''. This time, she received significant support from a strong lineup of guest stars: [[Bill Bixby]], [[John Ritter]], [[Harvey Korman]] and Dick Van Dyke. In the 1978–79 season, Moore attempted to try the musical-variety genre by starring in two unsuccessful CBS variety series in a row: ''[[Mary (1978 TV series)|Mary]]'', which featured [[David Letterman]], [[Michael Keaton]], [[Swoosie Kurtz]] and [[Dick Shawn]] in the supporting cast. CBS canceled the series. In March 1979, the network brought Moore back in a new, retooled show, ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Hour]]'', which was described as a "sit-var" (part situation comedy/part variety series) with Moore portraying a TV star putting on a variety show.&lt;ref name=museum/&gt; The program lasted just 11 episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Heffernan|first1=Virginia|title=Mary Tyler Moore, Who Incarnated the Modern Woman on TV, Dies at 80|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/25/arts/television/mary-tyler-moore-dead.html|accessdate=26 January 2017|work=The New York Times|date=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1985–86 season, she returned to CBS in a series titled ''[[Mary (1985 TV series)|Mary]]'', which suffered from poor reviews, sagging ratings, and internal strife within the production crew. According to Moore, she asked CBS to pull the show as she was unhappy with the direction of the program and the producers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Moore|1995|pp=266–267}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also starred in the short-lived ''[[Annie McGuire (TV series)|Annie McGuire]]'' in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Moore|1995|pp=271–272}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, after another lengthy break from TV series work, Moore was cast as tough, unsympathetic newspaper owner Louise "the Dragon" Felcott on the CBS drama ''[[New York News]]'', her third series in which her character worked in the news industry. As with her previous series ''Mary'' (1985), Moore quickly became unhappy with the nature of her character and was negotiating with producers to get out of her contract for the series when it was canceled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Grady|first1=Constance|title=Watch Mary Tyler Moore play against type in this forgotten 1995 drama|url=https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/1/25/14389972/mary-tyler-moore-new-york-news-madeline-kahn-fabio-1995-cbs|accessdate=26 January 2017|work=Vox|date=25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1990s, Moore had a cameo and a guest-starring role as herself on two episodes of ''[[Ellen (TV series)|Ellen]]''. She also guest-starred on [[Ellen DeGeneres]]'s next TV show, ''[[The Ellen Show]]'', in 2001. In 2004, Moore reunited with her ''Dick Van Dyke Show'' castmates for a reunion "episode" called ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show Revisited]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ken Tucker|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,634109,00.html|title=Review:The Dick Van Dyke Show Revisited|publisher=Ew.com|date=May 14, 2004|accessdate=August 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was the star of a new musical version of ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's (musical)|Breakfast at Tiffany's]]'' in December 1966, but the show, titled ''Holly Golightly'', was a flop that closed in previews before opening on Broadway. In reviews of performances in Philadelphia and Boston, critics "murdered" the play in which Moore claimed to be singing with bronchial pneumonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=UGAaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=5CcEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5182,1978228&amp;dq=holly-golightly+mary-tyler-moore&amp;hl=en |title=Boston and Philadelphia Critics Broke Mary Tyler Moore's Heart |publisher=News.google.com |date=December 4, 1966 |accessdate=August 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In honor of her father, George Tyler Moore, a lifelong [[American Civil War]] enthusiast, in 1995 Moore donated funds to acquire an historic structure in [[Shepherdstown, West Virginia]], for Shepherd College (now [[Shepherd University]]) to be used as a center for Civil War studies. The center, named the [[George Tyler Moore Center for the Study of the Civil War]], is housed in the historic [[Conrad Shindler House]] (c. 1795), which is named in honor of her great-great-great-grandfather, who owned the structure from 1815 to 1852.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shepherd.edu/gtmcweb/about_history.html |title=The George Tyler Moore Center for the Study of the Civil War |publisher=Shepherd.edu |date=November 16, 1993 |accessdate=August 14, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615190233/http://www.shepherd.edu/gtmcweb/about_history.html |archivedate=June 15, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moore also contributed to the renovation of the house used as headquarters during 1861–62 by [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] [[Major General (CSA)|Major General]] [[Thomas J.

==Politics==
During the 1960s and 1970s, Moore had a reputation as a liberal or moderate, although she endorsed President [[Richard Nixon]] in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=When Hollywood Was Right|author=Chritchlow, Donald T.|page=205|year=2013|isbn=9780521199186|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|location=Cambridge, England}}&lt;/ref&gt; She endorsed President [[Jimmy Carter]] for re-election in a [[United States presidential election, 1980|1980]] campaign television ad.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.popscreen.com/v/6yHwS/Historic-Campaign-Ads-_-Mary-Tyler-Moore "Historic Campaign Ads 'Mary Tyler Moore' Carter, 1980"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140525232626/http://www.popscreen.com/v/6yHwS/Historic-Campaign-Ads-_-Mary-Tyler-Moore |date=May 25, 2014 }} ''Popscreen''&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, friend and former co-star [[Ed Asner]] said during an interview on ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]'' that Moore "has become much more conservative of late". [[Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]], host of the aforementioned program, previously stated that Moore had been a viewer of his show and that her political views had leaned conservative in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2011/05/18/ed-asner-playing-warren-buffett-new-film-president-obama/|title=Ed Asner on Playing Warren Buffett in New Film, President Obama|author=|date=May 18, 2011|work=foxnews.com|accessdate=February 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a ''Parade'' magazine article from March 22, 2009, Moore identified herself as a libertarian centrist who watches [[Fox News]]. She stated, "...when one looks at what's happened to television, there are so few shows that interest me. I do watch a lot of Fox News. I like [[Charles Krauthammer]] and Bill O'Reilly... If [[John McCain|McCain]] had asked me to campaign for him, I would have."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://parade.com/130517/kevinsessums/mary-tyler-moores-lifetime-of-challenges/|title=Mary Tyler Moore's Lifetime of Challenges|newspaper=Parade|date=March 22, 2009|first=Kevin|last= Sessums|accessdate= May 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview for the 2013 PBS series ''Pioneers of Television,'' Moore said that she was recruited to join the feminist movement of the 1970s by [[Gloria Steinem]] but did not agree with Steinem's views. Moore said she believed that women have an important role in raising children and that she did not believe in Steinem's view that women owe it to themselves to have a career.&lt;ref name="pioneers-of-television"&gt;PBS, Television Series: Pioneers of Comedy, episode "Funny Ladies."

On May 8, 2002, Moore was present when cable network [[TV Land]] and the City of Minneapolis dedicated a statue in downtown [[Minneapolis]] of the television character she made famous on ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]''. The statue, by artist [[Gwendolyn Gillen]], was chosen from designs submitted by 21 sculptors.&lt;ref name=jsonline&gt;{{cite news|first=Sarah |last=Hauer |title=Obituary: Gwen Gillen created Mary Tyler Moore bronze |url=http://www.jsonline.com/story/entertainment/arts/2017/01/31/gwen-gillen-created-mary-tyler-moore-bronze/97253358/ |work=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]] |publisher= |date=2017-01-31 |accessdate=2017-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bronze sculpture was located in front of the [[Dayton's]] department store – now [[Macy's]] – near the corner of 7th Street South and [[Nicollet Mall]]. It depicts the iconic moment in the show's opening credits where Moore tosses her [[Tam o' shanter (cap)|Tam o' Shanter]] in the air, in a freeze-frame at the end of the montage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&amp;STORY=/www/story/03-19-2002/0001689536&amp;EDATE= |title="TV Land Honors Mary Tyler Moore", prnewswire.com |publisher=Prnewswire.com |date=March 19, 2002 |accessdate=August 14, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014201843/http://prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&amp;STORY=%2Fwww%2Fstory%2F03-19-2002%2F0001689536&amp;EDATE= |archivedate=October 14, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ci.minneapolis.mn.us/news/news_20020508mtmunveiling "Mary Tyler Moore to Unveil Tam Toss Statue May 8"] City of Minneapolis website&lt;/ref&gt; While Dayton's is clearly seen in the opening sequence, the store in the background of the hat toss is actually [[Donaldson's]], which was, like Dayton's, a locally based department store with a long history at 7th and Nicollet. In late 2015 the statue was placed in storage during renovations to the mall, and in December it was relocated to the city's visitor center, where it will remain until the renovation is complete in 2017, after which the plan is for it to be returned to its original location.&lt;ref name=storage /&gt;
