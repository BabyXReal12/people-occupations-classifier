'''Dana Thomas Carvey''' (born June 2, 1955) is an American [[Stand-up comedy|stand-up comedian]] and actor, who is most widely known for his work as a cast member on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (1986–1993) and for starring as Garth Algar in the ''[[Wayne's World (film)|Wayne's World]]'' films.

He is well known for his impersonations of [[George H. W. Bush]]  and [[Ross Perot]] on ''Saturday Night Live'' as well as portraying original ''SNL'' characters [[The Church Lady]] and Hans of [[Hans and Franz]].

==Early life==
Carvey was born in [[Missoula, Montana]], the second of two boys for Billie Dahl,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smdailyjournal.com/articles/obituaries/2014-09-03/billie-dahl-carvey/1776425129443.html|title=Billie Dahl Carvey - San Mateo Daily Journal|author=|date=|website=www.smdailyjournal.com|accessdate=24 May 2017}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/mercurynews/obituary.aspx?n=billie-dahl-carvey&amp;pid=172327882&amp;fhid=26208|title=Billie Dahl Carvey's Obituary on Mercury News|author=|date=|website=Mercury News|accessdate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a schoolteacher, and Bud Carvey,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilasting.com/williambudcarvey.php|title=Bud Carvey Memorial Website (1924-2016)|author=|date=|website=www.ilasting.com|accessdate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smdailyjournal.com/articles/obituaries/2016-05-05/william-john-bud-carvey/1776425162849.html|title=William John (Bud) Carvey - San Mateo Daily Journal|author=|date=|website=www.smdailyjournal.com|accessdate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a high school business teacher.&lt;ref name=carvey2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/39/Dana-Carvey.html|title=Dana Carvey Biography (1955-)| publisher=FilmReference.com|accessdate=September 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carvey is the brother of [[Brad Carvey]], the engineer/designer of the [[Video Toaster]]. The character Garth Algar is loosely based on Brad. Carvey has English, German, Irish, Norwegian, and Swedish ancestry, and was raised [[Lutheran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0006/29/lkl.00.html | work=CNN | title=CNN Transcript – Larry King Live: Dana Carvey Lives to Tell About Mistaken Bypass Surgery – June 29, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=CSTB&amp;p_theme=cstb&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB372DCEA09C48E&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM | work=Chicago Sun-Times | first=Cindy | last=Pearlman | title=Dana Carvey grabs at an 'Opportunity' | date=1990-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2002&amp;dat=19950106&amp;id=_r0iAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=1LUFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3766,1390499|title=Beaver County Times - Google News Archive Search|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he was three years old, his family moved to [[San Carlos, California]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityofsancarlos.org/civica/filebank/blobdload.asp?BlobID=5326 CITY OF SAN CARLOS ADOPTED 2009-2010 BUDGET]&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. He received his first drum kit at an early age. He attended Tierra Linda Junior High in San Carlos, [[Carlmont High School]] in [[Belmont, California]] (where he was a member of the [[California Interscholastic Federation#Sections|Central Coast Section]] champion cross country team),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.dyestatcal.com/ATHLETICS/XC/1971/ccsres.htm |title=CCS Finals – 1971 |publisher=Dyestatcal.com |accessdate=2011-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[College of San Mateo]] in San Mateo, California, and received his [[bachelor's degree]] in broadcast communications from [[San Francisco State University]].&lt;ref name=carveymt&gt;{{cite web|title=Dana Carvey|work=Montana Kids|publisher=Montana Office of Tourism|url=http://montanakids.com/cool_stories/famous_montanans/Carvey.htm|accessdate=August 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Early career===
Carvey had a minor role in ''[[Halloween II (1981 film)|Halloween II]]'' in 1981, and co-starred in ''[[One of the Boys (TV series)|One of the Boys]]'' in 1982, a short-lived television sitcom that also starred [[Mickey Rooney]], [[Nathan Lane]], and [[Meg Ryan]]. In 1984, Carvey had a small role in [[Rob Reiner]]'s film ''[[This Is Spinal Tap]],'' in which he played a [[mime artist|mime]], with fellow comedian [[Billy Crystal]] (who tells him "[[wikt:time is money|Mime is money!]]"). He appeared in the music video for the [[Greg Kihn]] song "Lucky" in 1985. He also appeared in the short-lived film-based action television series ''[[Blue Thunder (TV series)|Blue Thunder]].'' His big break came in 1986, when he co-starred opposite [[Kirk Douglas]] and [[Burt Lancaster]] in ''[[Tough Guys]]''. As a lifelong Douglas fan, Carvey threw in an affectionate impression of his mentor, while describing a hairy scene they did together on a moving train.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/23/movies/review-television-a-salute-to-kirk-douglas-for-his-life.html|title=Review/Television; A Salute to Kirk Douglas for His Life|publisher=NyTimes.com|date=May 23, 1991 |accessdate=January 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carvey was a finalist for the hosting role on the [[Nickelodeon]] TV game show ''[[Double Dare (Nickelodeon game show)|Double Dare]]''. He ultimately withdrew his name from consideration after he was cast on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. The job would go to [[Marc Summers]].

===''Saturday Night Live''===
In 1986, Carvey became a household name when he joined the cast of [[NBC]]'s ''Saturday Night Live''. He, along with newcomers [[Phil Hartman]], [[Kevin Nealon]], [[Jan Hooks]], and [[Victoria Jackson]], helped to reverse the show's declining popularity and made ''SNL'' "must-see" TV once again. An important part of the show's revival was Carvey's breakout character, the Church Lady, the uptight, smug, and pious host of ''Church Chat''.&lt;ref name="snlbackstage20110220"&gt;{{cite episode | title=Saturday Night Live Backstage | network=NBC | series=Saturday Night Live | airdate=2011-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carvey said he based the character on women he knew from church while growing up, who would keep track of other churchgoers' attendance. He became so associated with the character that later cast members such as [[Chris Farley]] referred to Carvey simply as "The Lady".&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carvey's other original characters included Garth Algar (from ''[[Wayne's World]]''), who was based on his brother;&lt;ref name=newsday&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/celebrities/dana-carvey-does-stand-up-at-the-paramount-1.5175640|title=Dana Carvey does stand-up at the Paramount|work=Newsday}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hans (from "[[Hans and Franz]]"); and the Grumpy Old Man (from ''[[Weekend Update]]'' appearances).  Throughout the election and presidency of [[George H. W. Bush]], he was the designated impersonator of the president, making him the lead actor of the regular political sketches on ''SNL''.

During the [[United States presidential election, 1992|1992 US presidential election campaign]], Carvey also did an impression of independent candidate [[Ross Perot]]; in a prime-time special before the election, Carvey played both George H. W. Bush and Perot in a three-way debate with [[Bill Clinton]], played by [[Phil Hartman]]. As Perot—recorded and timed to give the appearance of interacting with the live Bush and Clinton—Carvey eschewed the show's signature "Live from New York" opening line, telling Bush "Why don't you do it, live-boy?" Carvey left ''SNL'' in 1993.

In 1992, Carvey joined [[Mike Myers]] in ''Wayne's World'', the film. A sequel, ''[[Wayne's World 2]]'', was filmed and released in 1993.

Carvey's ''SNL'' work won him an [[Emmy Award]] in 1993 for Outstanding Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program. He has a total of six Emmy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/dana-carvey |title=Dana Carvey Emmy Nominated |publisher=Emmys.com |accessdate=2012-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; nominations. Carvey has returned to host ''SNL'' four times, in 1994, 1996, 2000, and 2011.

===After ''SNL''===
NBC executives hoped to get Carvey to take over the 12:30&amp;nbsp;am ET weeknight spot in the network's lineup in 1993 when [[David Letterman]] left his show, ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]],'' for an 11:30&amp;nbsp;pm ET show on [[CBS]]. The 12:30 spot eventually went to [[Conan O'Brien]].

In 1994, Carvey starred in the film ''[[Clean Slate (1994 film)|Clean Slate]].''  The following year, Carvey filmed his first [[HBO]] stand-up special ''Critic's Choice.''  The show featured Carvey doing many of his ''SNL'' impersonations, as well as making fun of the premium channel's name, pronouncing it "hobo".

He had to turn down a role in ''[[Bad Boys (1995 film)|Bad Boys]]'' because he felt overwhelmed as a new father.&lt;ref name=newsday/&gt;

He reprised many of his ''SNL'' characters in 1996 for ''[[The Dana Carvey Show]]'', a short-lived prime-time variety show on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. The show was most notable for launching [[Robert Smigel]]'s cartoon "[[The Ambiguously Gay Duo]]", as well as the careers of [[Steve Carell]] and [[Stephen Colbert]].

In 2002, he returned to films in the spy comedy ''[[The Master of Disguise]]''. Released a week after former colleague Mike Myers' successful (and similar) film ''[[Austin Powers in Goldmember]]'', most critics compared the movies and panned Carvey's effort. However, the movie did manage about $40 million at the North American box office.
In March 2007, review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] ranked the film as the 18th worst-reviewed movie of the 2000s decade, with an approval rating of 1% based on 103 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/master_of_disguise/ |title=Rotten Tomatoes |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=2012-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comedian and former ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'' host [[Michael J. Nelson]] named the film the third-worst comedy ever made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cracked.com/article_15047_inoperable-humor-5-worst-comedies-all-time.html |title=Inoperable Humor: The 5 Worst Comedies of All Time |accessdate=2010-04-17 |last=Nelson |first=Michael J. |authorlink= |work= |publisher=[[Cracked (magazine)|Cracked]] |pages= |language= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Carvey did not appear in a film again until 2011's ''[[Jack and Jill (2011 film)|Jack and Jill]]''. It, too, is considered one of the worst comedies of all time. He had previously appeared in another [[Adam Sandler]] film, ''[[Little Nicky]]''.&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://entertainment.time.com/2012/02/25/and-the-worst-film-of-the-year-is-officially/ | title=And the Worst Film of the Year Is Officially&amp;nbsp;... | work=[[TIME]] | date=February 25, 2012 | accessdate=May 13, 2013 | author=Carbone, Nick}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ind"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/adam-sandler-sets-worstmovie-record-as-jack-and-jill-wins-awards-in-every-category-at-razzies-7608369.html | title=Adam Sandler sets worst-movie record as Jack and Jill wins awards in every category at Razzies | work=[[The Independent]] | accessdate=May 13, 2013 | author=Germain, David | location=London | date=April 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is number 90 on [[Comedy Central]]'s list of the 100 Greatest Stand-Ups of All Time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everything2.com/title/Comedy+Central%2527s+100+Greatest+Stand-Ups+of+all+Time |title=Comedy Central's 100 Greatest Stand-Ups of all Time |publisher=Everything2.com |date=2004-04-18 |accessdate=2012-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===After ''The Master of Disguise''===

Carvey eventually withdrew from the limelight to focus on his family. He later said in an interview that he does not want to be in a career in which his kids would already be grown with him having neglected spending time with them, a major reason for his declining the hosting spot for ''Late Night'' that ultimately went to Conan O'Brien. Carvey has said that he generally prefers stand-up comedy to acting in movies and regularly performs lucrative corporate dates, boasting of "a few million-dollar months" during a 2016 Howard Stern interview.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marksfriggin.com/news16/10-31.htm#wed|title=MarksFriggin.com - Stern Show News - Archive|author=|date=|website=marksfriggin.com|accessdate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gq.com/story/dana-carvey-oral-history-dana-carvey-show|title=An Oral History of the Rise and Fall (and Rise) of "The Dana Carvey Show"|first=Mike|last=Ryan|date=8 August 2011|website=gq.com|accessdate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carvey made an appearance at the [[2008 MTV Movie Awards]], reprising his ''SNL'' character Garth Algar with host Mike Myers for a "Wayne's World" sketch. On June 14, 2008, Carvey filmed a second HBO stand-up special, the first in 13 years, entitled ''Squatting Monkeys Tell No Lies''.

In 2010, Carvey appeared in the ''[[Funny or Die]]'' original comedy sketch ''[[Presidential Reunion]]''. He played the role of President George H. W. Bush alongside other current and former ''SNL'' president impersonators.

In early 2010, Carvey and comedian/writer [[Spike Feresten]] created and starred together in ''Spoof'', a sketch comedy pilot for [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]. This included a sketch of a trailer for "Darwin", a mock film in which he played the evolutionary biologist, as well as a spoof of the hit TV series ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]''. Both of these sketches can be seen on [[YouTube]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Odsuv8x67dk |title=Dana Carvey is "DARWIN" |publisher=YouTube |date=2007-06-16 |accessdate=2012-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQB0NqRNCCo&amp;feature=related |title=Dana Carvey's LOST Spin-off |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=2012-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the animated TV series ''[[The Fairly OddParents]]'', Carvey voiced [[List of The Fairly OddParents characters|Cosmo Cosma]]'s con artist brother Schnozmo.

On April 29 and 30 of 2016 Dana Carvey recorded two live performances at the [[Wilbur Theatre]] in Boston, Massachusetts for a Netflix special to be released later in the year.  Trying their own hands at stand-up comedy, Dana's two sons Tom and Dex opened the show for him.

==Personal life==
In 1979, while performing at The Other Cafe in [[San Francisco]], Carvey met Paula Zwagerman. They became engaged in 1981 and married in 1983. The couple has two children, Dex and Thomas Carvey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dana Carvey Biography|url=http://www.biography.com/people/dana-carvey-225198|website=Biography.com|publisher=A&amp;E Television Networks|accessdate=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, Carvey underwent [[Coronary artery bypass surgery|heart bypass surgery]] for a blocked coronary artery, but the surgeon operated on the wrong artery. The blocked artery was deeply buried in muscle and thus hard to find; another artery, though not blocked, was clearly accessible; so the surgeon mistakenly performed the bypass on this unblocked artery. Carvey, later suffering from [[angina pectoris]], sued for [[medical malpractice]] and was awarded $8 million in damages. He donated the money to charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Falcon|first1=Mike|title=USATODAY.com - Heart operation no laugh for Dana Carvey|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/health/spotlight/2001-11-05-carvey-heart.htm|accessdate=4 December 2016|work=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dana Carvey Back After Heart Problems|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Primetime/story?id=132097&amp;page=1|accessdate=4 December 2016|work=ABC News|date=6 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has had to undergo additional surgery to correct his heart problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.com/archive/cover-story-the-heart-of-the-matter-vol-53-no-22/|title=Cover Story: The Heart of the Matter – Vol. 53 No. 22|author=|date=5 June 2000|website=people.com|accessdate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He told ''[[Newsday]]'' that, while he was in the hospital for his final angioplasty, [[Frank Sinatra]] died in the room adjacent to his.&lt;ref name=newsday/&gt;
