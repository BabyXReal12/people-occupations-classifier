===Content creator===
In November 2007, Helbig [[house sitting|house-sat]] for a family in [[South Orange, New Jersey]]. To alleviate boredom and keep herself entertained, she began a daily [[vlog]] of her house sitting experience on her personal YouTube channel ''GracieHinABox''. Beginning March 2008, Helbig and her college roommate Michelle Akin (née Vargas) created the ''Grace n' Michelle'' YouTube channel. The most recent video on this channel was uploaded on October 25, 2013, when Helbig visited Akin in [[Brooklyn]].

In early 2008, Helbig narrated the short-lived animated web series, ''Bedtime Stories'' on [[My Damn Channel]], which consisted of R-rated parodies of classic fairy tales.&lt;ref name="BedtimeStories" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tv.sys-con.com/node/585266 |title=My Damn Channel Gives in to Irrational Fans |publisher=sys-con.com |date=June 9, 2008 |accessdate=September 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; My Damn Channel founder and CEO Rob Barnett discovered her personal vlogs through her profile and offered her the opportunity to host her own video blog web series on the My Damn Channel website.&lt;ref name="LAWeekly"&gt;{{cite web|last=Carrie |first=Stephanie |url=http://blogs.laweekly.com/arts/2013/07/grace_helbig_mymusic.php |title=Why Grace Helbig Could Be the Next Big Star to Come From YouTube |publisher=Blogs.laweekly.com |date=July 29, 2013 |accessdate=September 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This became ''DailyGrace'', which premiered on April 14, 2008, with new episodes published every weekday.&lt;ref name="statedMagInterview" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20080714005842/en/Southern-Comfort-Big-Digital-Play-Bringing-SoCo |title=Southern Comfort Makes Big Digital Play Bringing the SoCo Music Experience to the Web |work=[[Business Wire]] |date=July 14, 2008 |accessdate=September 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CBSWiredForWomen" /&gt; On October 11, 2010, ''DailyGrace'' was launched as its own [[YouTube]] channel. By the end of December 2013, the channel had amassed over 2.4 million subscribers and over 211 million video views on YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tubefilter.com/2013/12/31/my-damn-channel-daily-grace-helbig/ |title=Grace Helbig Is Leaving My Damn Channel And ‘Daily Grace’ In 2014 |date=December 31, 2013 |accessdate=May 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the series' inception in April 2008 through December 2013, Helbig created over 830 ''DailyGrace'' episodes for the ''DailyGrace'' YouTube channel—in addition to the 690 ''DailyGrace'' episodes that had been published exclusively on the My Damn Channel website (i.e., all episodes up to October 8, 2010 as well as additional extra videos after that date).&lt;ref name="DailygraceMDC"/&gt;

From March 2012 through January 2013, Helbig hosted ''My Damn Channel LIVE'' once a week from the company's New York City studio (the remaining weekday episodes were hosted by Beth Hoyt).  In November 2013, the series was revived in a weekly format as ''My Damn Channel LIVE: Hangout'', with Helbig making a few appearances via [[Videophone|video chat]] from the Los Angeles studio.

On September 13, 2013, Helbig premiered her weekly web series ''Grace's Faces'' on beauty guru [[Bobbi Brown]]'s newly created YouTube channel ''I love makeup.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gutelle |first=Sam |url=http://www.tubefilter.com/2013/09/06/bobbi-brown-cosmetics-i-love-makeup-collective-digital-studio/ |title=Bobbi Brown, Collective DS Celebrate Cosmetics With 'I love makeup.' |publisher=Tubefilter.com |date=September 6, 2013 |accessdate=September 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kenzie Bryant |url=http://racked.com/archives/2013/09/06/7-reasons-to-look-forward-to-bobbi-browns-new-youtube-channel.php |title=7 Reasons to Look Forward to Bobbi Brown's YouTube Channel – Beauty – Racked National |publisher=Racked.com |date=September 6, 2013 |accessdate=September 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series lasted twenty-four episodes and ended March 7, 2014.

On November 4, 2013, Helbig premiered a weekly supplemental ''DailyGrace'' series exclusive to the My Damn Channel website entitled ''One Thing You Didn't Know About Me From Last Week''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mydamnchannel.com/daily_grace/one_thing_you_didn_t_know___/nudemexicanwrestling_11234 |title=One Thing You Didn't Know...

On December 27, 2013, Helbig uploaded her final ''DailyGrace'' episode to the ''DailyGrace'' YouTube channel. Four days later, My Damn Channel released a statement announcing that Helbig had chosen not to renew her multi-year contract with the network, and that going forward, no new content would be created by Helbig for the ''DailyGrace'' YouTube channel. My Damn Channel indicated that the ''DailyGrace'' YouTube channel would remain active solely as an archive, with plans for the network to upload the early ''DailyGrace'' episodes and other Helbig content that had formerly been exclusive to the My Damn Channel website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tubefilter.com/2013/12/31/my-damn-channel-daily-grace-helbig|title=Grace Helbig Is Leaving My Damn Channel And 'Daily Grace' In 2014|work=Tubefilter|accessdate=March 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
