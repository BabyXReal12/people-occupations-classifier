'''Ernest Edward "Ernie" Kovacs''' (January 23, 1919 – January 13, 1962) was an American comedian, actor, and writer.

Kovacs's visually experimental and often spontaneous comedic style influenced numerous television comedy programs for years after his death. Many individuals and shows, such as [[Johnny Carson]], [[David Letterman]], ''[[Laugh-In|Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In]]'', ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'', [[Jim Henson]], ''[[Max Headroom (character)|Max Headroom]]'',&lt;ref name=Connor&gt;{{Cite news |author=O'Connor, John J. |title=TV View: Ernie Kovacs: A comic to the medium born |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE1DA173CF93BA35750C0A961948260 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=March 8, 1987 |accessdate=January 7, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080313085052/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE1DA173CF93BA35750C0A961948260 |archivedate=March 13, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chevy Chase]],&lt;ref name="Chase"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chase |first=Chevy |title=The Unique Comedy of Ernie Kovacs |work=TV Guide |date=April 9, 1977 |pages=39–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author=O'Connor, John J. |title=TV: Why Ernie Kovacs's humor grows with time |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D07E2D91539F934A25752C1A964948260 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 17, 1982 |accessdate=January 7, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080313085203/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D07E2D91539F934A25752C1A964948260 |archivedate=March 13, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Conan O’Brien]],&lt;ref name=Visconage&gt;{{cite web|author=Visconage, Matt|title=Conan O'Brien and the Legacy of Ernie Kovacs|url=http://splitsider.com/2012/01/conan-obrien-and-the-legacy-of-ernie-kovacs|work=Splitsider|date=January 23, 2012|accessdate=February 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Jimmy Kimmel]], [[Captain Kangaroo]]'', ''[[Sesame Street]]'', ''[[The Electric Company]]'', [[Dave Garroway]],&lt;ref name=Willmore&gt;{{cite web|author=Willmore, Alison|title=Take a Look at the Unappreciated Genius of TV Pioneer Ernie Kovacs|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/television/ernie-kovacs|work=Indiewire|date=May 2, 2012|accessdate=February 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Uncle Floyd]], and many others&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Ernie Kovacs Phile|last=Walley |first=David G.|year=1987|publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc.]]|location=New York City|isbn=978-0-918282-06-4|page=202}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bren"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bren |first=Frank |work=Bright Lights Film Journal |title=Ernie Kovacs: An American Secret |date=31 October 2011 |accessdate=19 January 2017 |url=http://brightlightsfilm.com/ernie-kovacs-american-secret/# |location=Cathedral City, CA |publisher=Bright Lights Film Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; have credited Kovacs as an influence.

''TV Guide: the official collector's guide'', Bangzoom Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chase"/&gt;

Some of Kovacs's unusual behaviors include having pet [[marmoset]]s and wrestling a [[jaguar]] on his live Philadelphia television show.&lt;ref name="About"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=SKAuAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=d9oFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4483,4271179&amp;dq=ernie+kovacs+marmoset&amp;hl=en|title=Sleeps on TV Set|date=June 19, 1954|publisher=Beaver Valley Times|accessdate=July 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=KAwrAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=WZoFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6747,5623204&amp;dq=ernie+kovacs&amp;hl=en|title=The Lyons Den|date=May 13, 1954|author=Lyons, Leonard|publisher=Reading Eagle|accessdate=July 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=IVcxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=GuUFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6822,1274044&amp;dq=ernie+kovacs+wrestle&amp;hl=en|title=Kovacs Would Wrestle Jaguars But Steered Clear of the Gals|date=January 20, 1962|author=Lyons, Leonard|publisher=Lawrence Journal-World|accessdate=July 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When working at [[WABC (AM)]] as a morning-drive radio announcer and doing a mid-morning television series for [[NBC]], Kovacs claimed to dislike eating breakfast alone while his wife, [[Edie Adams]], was sleeping after her Broadway performances. His solution was to hire a taxi driver to come into their apartment with his own key and make breakfast for them both, then take Kovacs to the WABC studios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.erniekovacs.net/images/radio.jpg|title=Mayhem in the A.

While Kovacs and Adams received Emmy nominations for best performances in a comedy series during 1957, his talent was not recognized formally until after his death.&lt;ref name="CBS"/&gt; The 1962 Emmy for Outstanding Electronic Camera Work and the Directors' Guild award came a short time after his fatal accident.&lt;ref name="Directors"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Emmy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/awards/nominations/award-search?search_api_views_fulltext=kovacs&amp;submit=Search&amp;field_celebrity_details_field_display_name=&amp;field_show_details_field_nominee_show_nr_title=&amp;field_show_details_field_network=All&amp;field_show_details_field_production_company=All&amp;field_nominations_year=1949-01-01+00%3A00%3A00&amp;field_nominations_year_1=2016-01-01+00%3A00%3A00&amp;field_award_category=All|title=Emmy Awards Database-Ernie Kovacs|publisher=Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences|accessdate=March 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A quarter century later, he was inducted into the [[Television Hall of Fame|Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.emmys.tv/awards/hall-fame/hall-fame-archives-honorees |title=Academy of Television Arts and Sciences Hall of Fame Inductees |year=1987 |publisher=Academy of Television Arts and Sciences |accessdate=July 9, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131218100226/http://www.emmys.tv/awards/hall-fame/hall-fame-archives-honorees |archivedate=December 18, 2013 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kovacs also has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] for his work in television.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hwof.com/star/television/ernie-kovacs/1837|title=Hollywood Walk of Fame-Ernie Kovacs|publisher=Hollywood Walk of Fame|accessdate=July 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, the Museum of Broadcasting (later to become the Museum of Television &amp; Radio and now the [[Paley Center for Media]]) presented an exhibit of Kovacs's work, called ''The Vision of Ernie Kovacs''. The Pulitzer Prize–winning television critic, William Henry III, wrote for the museum's booklet: "Kovacs was more than another wide-eyed, self-ingratiating clown. He was television's first significant video artist."&lt;ref name="Vision"&gt;{{Cite web|title='Vision of Ernie Kovacs' honors first video artist|author=Dudek, Duane|date=June 16, 1986|publisher=Milwaukee Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==
Kovacs's father, Andrew, emigrated from [[Hungary]] at age 13. He worked as a policeman, restaurateur, and bootlegger; the last so successfully that he moved his wife Mary, and sons Tom and Ernie, into a 20-room mansion in the better part of Trenton.&lt;ref name="Clowns"/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{Cite news|author=Goodman, Mark|title='Nothing in moderation'|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE4DE133FF930A25756C0A966958260&amp;scp=4|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 13, 1990|accessdate=December 10, 2008|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xGMrLUJ4?url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE4DE133FF930A25756C0A966958260&amp;scp=4|archivedate=March 17, 2011|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though a poor student, Kovacs was influenced by his [[Trenton Central High School]] drama teacher, Harold Van Kirk, and received an acting scholarship to the [[American Academy of Dramatic Arts]] in 1937 with Van Kirk's help. The end of Prohibition and the Depression resulted in difficult financial times for the family. When Kovacs began drama school, all he could afford was a fifth floor walk-up apartment on [[West 74th Street]] in New York City.&lt;ref name="Serious"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=7rceAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Q2UEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5709,4130335&amp;dq=ernie+kovacs&amp;hl=en|title=Ernie Kovacs:Serious-Minded Clown| date=January 21, 1962|publisher=Sarasota Herald-Tribune|author=Ryan, Jack|accessdate=August 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Edie"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/13846507/ernie_kovacs_what_a_husband/|title=Ernie Kovacs-what a husband!|page=113|author=Kovacs, Edie Adams|date=July 20, 1958|publisher=Palm Beach Post|accessdate=November 7, 2010|via = [[Newspapers.com]]}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;
During this time, he watched many "[[B movie|Grade B]]" movies; admission was only ten cents. Many of these movies influenced his comedy routines later.&lt;ref name="Clowns"/&gt;

A 1938 local newspaper photograph shows Kovacs as a member of the Prospect Players, not yet wearing his trademark mustache.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_N_-W1PmSNqg/SXvT2gIbqRI/AAAAAAAAJgM/dJ-LCaJ8Y8k/s1600-h/1938+Ernie+Kovacs+in+a+Prospect+Presbyterian+Playweb.jpg|title=Discussing Plot and Action|date=March 6, 1938|publisher=Trenton Sunday Times Advertiser|accessdate=November 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like any aspiring actor, Kovacs used his class vacation time to pursue roles in summer stock companies. While working in Vermont during 1939, he became so seriously ill with pneumonia and pleurisy that his doctors didn't expect him to survive. During the next year and a half, his comedic talents developed as he entertained both doctors and patients with his antics during stays at several hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=oOkKAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=4k8DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6625,2617383&amp;dq=ernie+kovacs&amp;hl=en|title=Ernie Kovacs Doing Fine 'Living on Borrowed Time'|date=December 18, 1959|author=Thomas, Bob|publisher=Prescott Evening Courier|accessdate=July 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; While hospitalized, Kovacs developed a lifelong love of classical music by the gift of a radio, which he kept tuned to [[WFME (AM)#History|WQXR]]. By the time he was released, his parents had separated, and Kovacs went back to Trenton, living with his mother in a two-room apartment over a store. He began work as a cigar salesman, which resulted in a lifelong cigar-smoking habit.&lt;ref name="Clowns"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=tDMsAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=zssEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7132,1575081&amp;dq=ernie+kovacs&amp;hl=en|title=Gentle, Quiet Kovacs Killed in Car Crash|date=January 14, 1962|publisher=Herald-Journal|accessdate=August 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kovacs's first paid entertainment work was during 1941, as an announcer for Trenton's radio station [[WTTM]]. He spent the next nine years with WTTM, becoming the station's director of Special Events; in this job he did things like trying to see what it was like to be run over by a train (leaving the tracks at the last minute) and broadcasting from the cockpit of a plane for which he took flying lessons. Kovacs was also involved with local theater; a local newspaper published a photograph of him and the news that he was doing some directing for the Trenton Players Guild in early 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_N_-W1PmSNqg/RoMQJPnPYdI/AAAAAAAABmU/qK3L03jhlJY/s1600-h/1941+ERNIE+KOVACS.jpg|title=Directs Play|date=January 19, 1941|publisher=Tom Glover|accessdate=November 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Trentonian'', a local weekly newspaper, offered Kovacs a column in June 1945; he named it "Kovacs Unlimited".&lt;ref name="Clowns"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Trentonian"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.trentonian.com/articles/2010/05/02/news/doc4bde3ede47e68167292280.txt|title=Look Who's Talking|author=Edelstein, Jeff|date=May 2, 2010|publisher=The Trentonian|accessdate=July 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Start in television==
[[File:Kovacs 3 to get ready 1951.JPG|thumb|180px|Kovacs and Gertrude on ''Three to Get Ready'', 1951. Gertrude was one of the donations of Kovacs's viewers when he asked them to bring anything they no longer wanted to the WPTZ-TV lobby.]]

Arriving at [[NBC]]'s Philadelphia affiliate, WPTZ, for an audition wearing a barrel and shorts got Kovacs his first television job in January 1950. His first show was ''Pick Your Ideal'', a fashion and promotional program for the Ideal Manufacturing Company. Before long, Kovacs was also the host of  ''Deadline For Dinner'' and ''Now You're Cooking'', shows featuring advice from local chefs.&lt;ref name=Fifties&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,166670-3,00.html|title=Philly Fifties: TV|author=Corliss, Richard|date=July 7, 2001|publisher=Time|accessdate=February 9, 2011}}subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Now [[KYW-TV]]; though the current NBC affiliate is [[WCAU-TV]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com|title=NBC Philadelphia}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} When Kovacs's guest chef did not arrive in time for the show, he offered a recipe for "Eggs Scavok" (Kovacs spelled backward).&lt;ref name="Pioneers"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ernie"/&gt; Hosting these shows soon resulted in his becoming host of a program named ''Three to Get Ready'', named for WPTZ's channel 3 spot on television dials.&lt;ref name="Vision"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pioneers"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.broadcastpioneers.com/kovacsinphilly.html|title=Ernie Kovacs|publisher=Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia|accessdate=July 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Premiering in November 1950, ''Three to Get Ready'' was innovative, because it was the first regularly scheduled early morning (7–9am) show in a major television market, predating NBC's [[Today (U.S. TV program)|''Today'']] by more than a year. Prior to this, it had been assumed that few people would watch television at such an early hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=sh8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=ernie+kovacs#v=onepage&amp;q=ernie%20kovacs&amp;f=false|title=WPTZ's Kovacs Reaps Early Scanner Harvest|publisher=Billboard|date=April 7, 1951|accessdate=November 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the show was advertised as early morning news and weather, Kovacs provided this and more in an original manner.  When rain was in the weather forecast, Kovacs would get on a ladder and pour water down on the staff member reading the report.&lt;ref name="Pioneers"/&gt; Goats were auditioned for a local theater performance and tiny women appeared to walk up his arm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|publisher=Billboard|date=December 1, 1951|title=Kovacs Gets His Own Goat|url=https://books.google.com/?id=B0UEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=ernie+kovacs#v=onepage&amp;q=ernie%20kovacs&amp;f=false|accessdate=November 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Young"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://blog.modernmechanix.com/2008/03/23/tvs-tiniest-actress/?Qwd=./MechanixIllustrated/9-1955/tiny_actress&amp;Qif=tiny_actress_0.jpg&amp;Qiv=thumbs&amp;Qis=XL#qdig|title=TV's Tiniest Actress|date=September 1955|publisher=Mechanix Illustrated|accessdate=November 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kovacs also went outside of the studio for some of his skits, running through a downtown Philadelphia restaurant in a gorilla suit in one, and looking into a construction pit saying it was deep enough to see to China, when a man in Chinese clothing popped up, said a few words in the language, and ran off.&lt;ref name="Pioneers"/&gt; Despite its popularity, the weekly prop budget for the show was just $15. Kovacs once asked his viewers to send unwanted items to Channel 3; they filled the station's lobby.&lt;ref name="Pioneers"/&gt;

The only character no one ever saw inspired more gifts; he was Howard, the World's Strongest Ant. From the time of his WPTZ debut, Howard received more than 30,000 gifts from Kovacs's viewers, including a mink lined swimming pool.&lt;ref name="Young"/&gt; Kovacs began his Early Eyeball Fraternal &amp; Marching Society (EEFMS) while doing ''Three to Get Ready''.

WPTZ did not begin broadcasting ''Today'' when it premiered on January 14, 1952; network influence caused the station to end ''Three to Get Ready'' at the end of March of that year.&lt;ref name="Pioneers"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=iR4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA8&amp;dq=ernie+kovacs#v=onepage&amp;q=ernie%20kovacs&amp;f=false |title=WPTZ To Shift Kovacs, Take Garroway TV|date=March 29, 1952|publisher=Billboard|accessdate=November 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=8uErAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=12UFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1599,3971024&amp;dq=ernie+kovacs&amp;hl=en|title=Garroway-More at Large Than on TV |author=Perrigo, Lucia|date=November 9, 1951|publisher=Kentucky New Era|accessdate=July 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During early 1952, Kovacs was also doing a late morning show for WPTZ named ''Kovacs on the Corner''. Kovacs would walk through an imaginary neighborhood, talking with various characters such as Pete the Cop and Luigi the Barber. As with ''Three to Get Ready'', there were some special segments. "Swap Time" was one of them; viewers could bring their unwanted items to the WPTZ studios to trade them live on the air with Kovacs. The show made its debut on January 4, 1952, with Kovacs losing creative control of the program soon after it was begun. ''Kovacs on the Corner'' was short-lived; it ended on March 28, 1952, along with ''Three to Get Ready''.&lt;ref name="Pioneers"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ernie"/&gt; Kovacs then began work for [[WCBS-TV]], New York with a local morning show and a later network one. Both programs were canceled; Kovacs lost the local morning program for the same reason as ''Three to Get Ready'' – the broadcasting time was confiscated by the station's network in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lB4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=red+skelton#v=onepage&amp;q=red%20skelton&amp;f=false|title=Kovacs' Time is Pre-Empted|date=January 16, 1954|publisher=Billboard|accessdate=May 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visual humor and characters==
[[File:Take a good look adams kovacs 1960.JPG|thumb|right|With [[Edie Adams]] in the television series ''[[Take a Good Look (TV series)|Take a Good Look]]'']]
At WPTZ, Kovacs began using the ad-libbed and experimental style that would become his reputation, including video effects, superimpositions, reverse polarities and scanning, and quick blackouts. He was also noted for abstraction and carefully timed [[Non sequitur (literary device)|non-sequitur]] gags and for allowing the [[fourth wall]] to be breached.&lt;ref name="Young"&gt;{{cite book|title=When Television Was Young: The Inside Story with Memories by Legends of the Small Screen|editor-last=McMahon|editor-first=Ed|editor2-last=Fisher|editor2-first=David|publisher=Thomas Nelson|year=2007|pages=288|isbn=1-4016-0327-0|url=https://books.google.com/?id=2uN_AkdwAioC&amp;pg=PA93&amp;dq=ernie+kovacs#v=onepage&amp;q=ernie%20kovacs&amp;f=false|accessdate=November 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kovacs's cameras commonly showed his viewers' activity beyond the boundaries of the show [[set construction|set]]—including crew members and outside the [[studio]] itself. Kovacs also liked talking to the off-camera crew and even introduced segments from the studio control room.&lt;ref name="Dumont"/&gt; He frequently made use of accidents and happenstance, incorporating the unexpected into his shows. In one of Kovacs's Philadelphia broadcasts, Oscar Liebetrau, an elderly crew member who was known to often sleep for the duration of the telecast, was introduced to the audience as "Sleeping Schwartz." Kovacs was once knocked unconscious when a pie smashed to his face still had the plate under it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/125079473/?terms=edie%2Bmarilyn%2Bspoof|title=Edie to imic Marilyn Again|author=Wilson, Earl|date=February 5, 1970|page=11A|publisher=Florida Today|accessdate=January 8, 2017}}(subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt;

Kovacs's love of spontaneity extended to his crew, who would occasionally play on-air pranks on him to see how he would react.&lt;ref name="Wendell"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0fEvAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=A_0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2964,4341043&amp;dq=bill+wendell&amp;hl=en|title=Bill Wendell, 75, Television Announcer|date=April 16, 1999|publisher=Lakeland Ledger|accessdate=November 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; During one of his NBC shows, Kovacs was appearing as the inept magician Matzoh Heppelwhite. The sketch called for the magician to frequently hit a gong, which was the signal for a sexy female assistant to bring out a bottle and shot glass for a quick snort of alcohol. Stagehands substituted real liquor for the iced tea normally used for the skit. Kovacs realized that he would be called upon to drink a shot of liquor for each successive gong. He pressed on with the sketch and was quite inebriated by the end of the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=nnYfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=MXYFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5509,3178344&amp;dq=percy+dovetonsils&amp;hl=en|title=Channel Markers|date=February 18, 1961|publisher=The Norwalk Hour|accessdate=March 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kovacs helped develop camera tricks still common decades after his death. His character Eugene sat at a table to eat his lunch, but as he removed items one at a time from a lunch box, he watched them inexplicably roll down the table into the lap of a man reading a newspaper at the other end. When Kovacs poured milk from a thermos bottle, the stream flowed in a seemingly unusual direction. Never seen on television before, the secret was using a tilted set in front of a camera tilted at the same angle.&lt;ref name=LifeMagazine/&gt;{{sfn|Spigel|2009|p=190}}
[[Image:Kovacs hole in head 2-1957 special.jpg|150px|thumb|[[Barbara Loden]] and Kovacs positioned in front of two television cameras for illusion.]]
He constantly sought new techniques and used both primitive and improvised ways of creating visual effects that would later be done electronically. One innovative construction involved attaching a [[kaleidoscope]] made from a toilet paper roll to a camera lens with cardboard and tape and setting the resulting abstract images to music.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|editor-last=Silverblatt|editor-first=Art|title=Genre Studies in Mass Media: A Handbook|year=2007|page=258|publisher=M.

Used on a camera and turning it could put Kovacs seemingly on the ceiling.&lt;ref name="Pioneers"/&gt; An underwater stunt involved cigar smoker Kovacs sitting in an easy chair, reading his newspaper and somehow smoking a cigar. Removing it from his mouth, Kovacs was able to exhale a puff of white smoke, all while floating underwater. The trick: the "smoke" was a small amount of milk which he filled his mouth with before submerging. Kovacs repeated the effect for a [[Dutch Masters (cigar)|Dutch Masters]] television commercial on his ABC game show, ''[[Take a Good Look (TV series)|Take A Good Look]]''.&lt;ref name="Clowns"/&gt;
[[Image:Kovacs hole in head-3 1957 special.jpg|120px|thumb|left|As seen on television; Kovacs appears to be looking through [[Barbara Loden]]'s head.]]

One of the special effects he employed made it appear as if he was able to look through his assistant, [[Barbara Loden]]'s, head.  The illusion was performed by placing a black patch on Loden's head and standing her against a black background while one studio camera was trained on her. A second one photographed Kovacs, who used the studio monitor to position himself exactly so that his eye would appear to be looking through a hole in her head.&lt;ref name=LifeMagazine/&gt;

He also developed such routines as an all-gorilla version of ''[[Swan Lake]]'', a poker game set to [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s ''[[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Fifth Symphony]]'', the skit ''Silent Show'', in which Eugene interacts with the world accompanied solely by music and sound effects, parodies of typical television commercials and movie genres, and various musical segments with everyday items (such as kitchen appliances or office equipment) moving in sync to music.&lt;ref name="Theory"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Horton&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ernie Kovacs &amp; Early TV Comedy|url=https://books.google.com/?id=zzXtobwmRZAC&amp;pg=PA53&amp;dq=ernie+kovacs+swan+lake#v=onepage&amp;q=ernie%20kovacs%20swan%20lake&amp;f=false|editor-last=Horton|editor-first=Andrew|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn= 9780292779624|accessdate=September 3, 2013|date=March 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A popular recurring skit was [[The Nairobi Trio]], three derby-hatted apes miming mechanically and rhythmically to the tune of [[Robert Maxwell (songwriter)|Robert Maxwell]]'s "Solfeggio".&lt;ref name=genius/&gt;{{sfn|Greene|2007|pp=65-66}}

Kovacs used extended sketches and mood pieces or quick blackout gags lasting only seconds. Some could be expensive, such as his famous used car salesman routine with a jalopy and a breakaway floor: it cost $12,000 to produce the six-second gag.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia"&gt;{{Cite book|editor1-last=Newcomb|editor1-first=Horace|editor2-last=Dearborn|editor2-first=Fitzroy|title=Encyclopedia of Television|year=2005|pages=2697|publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn|url=https://books.google.com/?id=CFXgj7a55agC&amp;pg=PA816&amp;dq=ernie+kovacs#v=onepage&amp;q=ernie%20kovacs&amp;f=false|isbn=1-57958-411-X|accessdate=July 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the first television comedians to use odd fake credits and comments between the legitimate credits and, at times, during his routines.&lt;ref name="Series"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=j7kvAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=kNsFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4966,2940400&amp;dq=ernie+kovacs+credits&amp;hl=en|title=Ernie Kovacs Back on the Right Track|author=Danzig, Fred|date=September 22, 1962|publisher=Beaver Country Times|accessdate=October 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rehearse"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=bjkpAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=vk8DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4957,3466495&amp;dq=edie+adams&amp;hl=en|title=Latest TV Star, Kovacs, Needs To Rehearse|author=Crosby, John|date=January 8, 1953|publisher=St. Petersburg Times|accessdate=November 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kovacs reportedly disliked working in front of a live audience, as was the case with the shows he did for NBC during the 1950s. He found the presence of an audience distracting, and those in the seats frequently did not understand some of the more elaborate visual gags and special effects, which could only be appreciated by watching studio monitors instead of the stage.&lt;ref name="Seriously"/&gt;

Like many comedians of the era, Kovacs created a rotation of recurring roles. In addition to the silent "Eugene," his most familiar characters were the fey, lisping poet [[Percy Dovetonsils]], and the heavily accented German radio announcer, Wolfgang von Sauerbraten. Mr. Question Man, who answered viewer queries, was a satire on the long-run (1937–56) radio series, ''[[The Answer Man]]''. Others included horror show host Auntie Gruesome, bumbling magician Matzoh Heppelwhite, Frenchman Pierre Ragout, and Miklos Molnar, the sardonic Hungarian host of a cooking show.&lt;ref name="Watching"&gt;{{Cite book|editor-last=Castleman|editor-first=Harry|editor2-last=Podrazik|editor2-first=Walter|year=2004|title=Watching TV: Six Decades of American Television|page=416|publisher=Syracuse University Press|url=https://books.google.com/?id=A16TTK0vN7sC&amp;pg=PA149&amp;dq=ernie+kovacs#v=onepage&amp;q=ernie%20kovacs&amp;f=false|isbn=0-8156-2988-5|accessdate=July 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Miklos character wasn't always confined to a kitchen; Kovacs performed a parody of [[Howdy Doody|''The Howdy Doody Show'']] with "Buffalo Miklos" as the host.&lt;ref name=Horton/&gt;&lt;ref name="Seriously"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.paleycenter.org/collection/item/?q=ernie+kovacs&amp;f=all&amp;c=all&amp;advanced=1&amp;p=4&amp;item=B:22490|title=The Ernie Kovacs Show (NBC)|date=August 13, 1956|publisher=Paley Center for Media|accessdate=July 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poet Percy Dovetonsils can be found playing Beethoven's ''Moonlight Sonata'' on a disappearing piano and as a "Master Detective" on the "Private Eye-Private Eye" presentation of the ''[[The United States Steel Hour|US Steel Hour]]'' on CBS March 8, 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoTWzZ893go|title=Video-YouTube-Percy Dovetonsils-Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata|accessdate=July 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=rM8zAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=7fcDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1178,633157&amp;dq=ernie+kovacs+private+eye&amp;hl=en|title=TV private eye took it on the chin Wednesday night|author=Danzig, Fred|date=March 9, 1961|publisher=The Bulletin|accessdate=July 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same show, the Nairobi Trio abandons their instruments for a safe cracking job; still with a background of "Solfeggio" but speaking, two of the three appear in an "Outer Space" sketch.&lt;ref name=Horton/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=--UQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=0uIDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6904,1154759&amp;dq=ernie+kovacs+private+eye&amp;hl=en|title=Private Eye-Private Eye Stars Kovacs Tonight|date=March 8, 1961|publisher=Eugene Register-Guard|accessdate=July 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kovacs never hesitated to lampoon those considered institutions of radio and television. In April 1954, he started the late-night talk show, ''[[The Ernie Kovacs Show]]'', on [[DuMont Television Network]]'s New York flagship station, WABD. Stage, screen, and radio notables were often guests. [[Archie Bleyer]], head of Cadence Records, came to chat one evening.  Bleyer had been the long-time orchestra director for [[Arthur Godfrey]]'s radio and television shows.  He had been dismissed by Godfrey the year before along at the same time as fellow cast member, singer [[Julius La Rosa]].  In La Rosa's case, he hired a manager, defying an unwritten Godfrey policy. With Bleyer, Godfrey was angered when he found Bleyer's record company [[Cadence Records]] had produced spoken word material by [[Don McNeill (radio presenter)|Don McNeill]], host of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Don McNeill's Breakfast Club]]'', which Godfrey considered competition to his show. Bleyer and Kovacs were shown in [[Split screen (filmmaking)|split screen]], with Kovacs wearing a red wig, headphones, and playing a ukulele in a Godfrey imitation, while talking with his guest.&lt;ref name="Dumont"/&gt;

Kovacs's television programs included ''Three to Get Ready'' (an early morning program seen on Philadelphia's [[KYW-TV|WPTZ]] from 1950 through 1952), ''It's Time for Ernie'' (1951, his first network series),&lt;ref name="Pioneers"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=1B4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA6&amp;dq=ernie+kovacs#v=onepage&amp;q=ernie%20kovacs&amp;f=false|title=Time For Ernie|editor-last=Ackerman|editor-first=Paul|publisher=Billboard|date=June 2, 1951|accessdate=November 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ernie in Kovacsland'', (a summer replacement show for [[Kukla, Fran and Ollie]], 1951),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0043195/|title=Ernie in Kovacsland|publisher=Internet Movie Database|accessdate=November 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Ernie Kovacs Show]]'' (1952–56 on various networks),&lt;ref name="Dumont"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Forgotten Network: DuMont and the Birth of American Television|editor-last=Weinstein|editor-first=David|year=2006|publisher=Temple University Press|page=240|isbn=1-59213-499-8|url=https://books.google.com/?id=tV7fXlQQdz4C&amp;pg=PA175&amp;dq=ernie+kovacs#v=onepage&amp;q=ernie%20kovacs&amp;f=false|accessdate=November 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rehearse"/&gt; a twice-a-week job filling in for [[Steve Allen]] as host of ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' on Mondays and Tuesdays (1956–57), and game shows ''[[Gamble on Love]]'', ''[[One Minute Please]]'',&lt;ref name="About"/&gt; ''[[Time Will Tell (TV series)|Time Will Tell]]'' (all on DuMont),&lt;ref name="Dumont"/&gt; and ''[[Take a Good Look (TV series)|Take a Good Look]]'' (1959–61).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.erniekovacs.info/TAGL.html|title=Take A Good Look|publisher=erniekovacs.info|accessdate=July 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kovacs was also the host of a program, ''Silents Please'', which showed silent movies on network television, with serious discussion about the movies and their actors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/1523658/silents_please_1961/|title=Like Old Songs, Silent Movies Are Coming Back|author=Crosby, John|date=April 3, 1961|publisher=Janesville Daily Gazette|page=12|accessdate=January 5, 2015|via = [[Newspapers.com]]}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kovacs had a brief stint as a celebrity panelist for the television series ''[[What's My Line?]]'', but took his responsibilities less than seriously, often eschewing a legitimate question for the sake of a laugh. An example: Industrialist [[Henry J. Kaiser]], the founder of an automobile company, was the program's "mystery guest." Previous questioning had established that the mystery guest's name was synonymous with an automobile brand, Kovacs asked, "Are you – and this is just a wild guess – but are you [[Abraham Lincoln]]?"—a reference to the [[Ford Motor Company]]'s Lincoln brand automobiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|editor-last=Allen|editor-first=Steve|title=Steve Allen's Private Joke File|year=2000|pages=432|publisher=Three River Press|url=https://books.google.com/?id=bi0-4WDPGrEC&amp;pg=PA245&amp;dq=ernie+kovacs#v=onepage&amp;q=ernie%20kovacs&amp;f=false|isbn=0-609-80672-6|accessdate=July 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Kovacs gave an interview admitting that he was absent from the show when he wanted to go out for dinner on a Sunday, his stint on the panel show was ended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=MK0yAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=qOoFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=765,459345&amp;dq=ernie+kovacs&amp;hl=en|title=What!

He also did several television specials, including the famous ''[[Silent Show]]'' (1957), featuring his character, Eugene, the first all-pantomime prime-time network program. After the end of the [[Dean Martin]]-[[Jerry Lewis]] partnership, NBC offered Lewis the opportunity to host his own 90-minute color television special. Lewis opted to use only 60 minutes, leaving the network 30 minutes to fill; no one wanted this [[time slot]], but Kovacs was willing to have it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Ernie Kovacs Phile|last=Walley |first=David G.|year=1987|publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc.]]|location=New York City|isbn=978-0-918282-06-4|page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Greene|2007|p=65}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://users.rcn.com/manaben/Klifemag.html|title=Ernie's Life Magazine cover |author=Model, Ben|publisher=Model, Ben|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060208071526/http://users.rcn.com/manaben/Klifemag.html |archivedate = February 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program contained no spoken dialogue and contained only sound effects and music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=7hRUAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=pDkNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3789,2560910&amp;dq=ernie+kovacs&amp;hl=en|title=TV Key Previews|date=January 19, 1957|publisher= St. Joseph News-Press|accessdate=March 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Featuring Kovacs as the mute, [[Charlie Chaplin]]-like character "Eugene", the program contained [[Surreal humour|surreal]] sight gags.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ugUdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=14oEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7113,2850782&amp;dq=ernie+kovacs+eugene&amp;hl=en|title=Radio &amp; TV|author=Crosby, John|date=January 24, 1957|publisher=Sarasota Journal|accessdate=November 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kovacs developed the Eugene character during the autumn of 1956 when hosting the television series ''[[The Tonight Show]]''.{{sfn|Greene|2007|p=66}} Expectations were high for the Lewis program, but it was Kovacs's special that received the most attention; Kovacs received his first movie offer, had a cover story in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine, and received the [[Sylvania Award]] that year.&lt;ref name="Vision"/&gt;&lt;!-- Comment Emmys began during 1949 http://www.emmys.com/award_history_search?person=ernie+kovacs&amp;program=&amp;start_year=1949&amp;end_year=2010&amp;network=All&amp;web_category=All&amp;winner=All --&gt; 
In 1961, Kovacs and his co-director, Joe Behar, were recipients of the [[Directors Guild of America]] Award for a second version of this program broadcast by the [[American Broadcasting Company]] network.&lt;ref name="Ernie"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/K/htmlK/kovaksernie/kovacsernie.htm |title=Ernie Kovacs, U.S. Comedian|author=Chorba, Frank J.|publisher=The Museum of Broadcast Communications|accessdate=November 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A series of monthly half-hour specials for ABC during 1961–62 is often considered his best television work. Produced on videotape using new editing and special effects techniques, it won a 1962 [[Emmy Award]].&lt;ref name="Emmy"/&gt; Kovacs and co-director Behar also won the Directors Guild of America award for an ''Ernie Kovacs Special'' based on the earlier silent "Eugene" program. Kovacs's last ABC special was broadcast posthumously, on January 23, 1962.&lt;ref name="Directors"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/13989140/kovacs_posthumous_honor/|title=Late Ernie Kovacs Is Honored As Best TV Director Of 1961|page=18|date=12 February 1962|publisher=Courier-Journal|accessdate=September 25, 2017|via = [[Newspapers.com]]}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dutch Masters (cigar)|Dutch Masters]] cigar company became well known during the late 1950s and early 1960s for its sponsorship of various television projects of Ernie Kovacs. The company allowed Kovacs total creative control in the creation of their television commercials for his programs and specials.  He produced a series of non-speaking television commercials for Dutch Masters during the run of his television series ''Take A Good Look'' which was praised by both television critics and viewers.{{sfn|Spigel|2009|pp=202-203}}{{efn|During 1960, the trade journal ''[[Advertising Age]]'' termed Kovacs "one of the TV commercial's best public relations experts right now". Shortly before his death, Kovacs was negotiating with Colgate-Palmolive to produce silent commercials for the company's products. After Kovacs's death the trade magazine ''[[Printers' Ink]]'' wrote that Kovacs's silent Dutch Masters commercials proved that creativity can be compatible with commercialism and that pioneering with regard to sponsorship can pay.{{sfn|Spigel|2009|p=205}}{{sfn|Samuel|2001|p=173}}}}

While praised by critics,  Kovacs rarely had a highly rated show.&lt;ref name=Museum/&gt; The Museum of Broadcast Communications says, "It is doubtful that Ernie Kovacs would find a place on television today. He was too zany, too unrestrained, too undisciplined. Perhaps Jack Gould of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said it best for Ernie Kovacs: 'The fun was in trying'."&lt;ref name="Museum"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/E/htmlE/ErnieKovaksShow/erkovacshow.htm |title=The Ernie Kovacs Show |publisher=Museum of Broadcast Communications |accessdate=September 5, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204111710/http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/E/htmlE/ErnieKovaksShow/erkovacshow.htm |archivedate=December 4, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other shows had greater success while using elements of Kovacs's style. [[George Schlatter]], producer of the later television series ''Rowan &amp; Martin's Laugh-In'', was married to actress Jolene Brand, who had appeared in Kovacs's comic troupes over the years and had been a frequent participant in his pioneering sketches. ''Laugh-In'' made frequent use of the quick blackout gags and surreal humor that marked many Kovacs projects. Another link was a young NBC staffer, [[Bill Wendell]], Kovacs's usual announcer and sometimes a sketch participant. From 1980–1995, Wendell was the announcer for [[David Letterman]], whose show and style of humor were greatly influenced by Kovacs.&lt;ref name="Wendell"/&gt;

==The Music Man==
Kovacs was also known for his eclectic musical taste. His main theme song was named "Oriental Blues" by Jack Newton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/oriental-blues/oclc/62472943|title=Oriental Blues|author=Newton, Jack|publisher=WorldCat|accessdate=January 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rendition most often heard was a piano-driven trio version, but for his primetime show during 1956, music director Harry Sosnik presented a full-blown big band version. The German song "Die Moritat von Mackie Messer" from ''[[The Threepenny Opera]]'' (anglicized to "[[Mack the Knife]]"), frequently underscored his blackout routines.{{sfn|Spigel|2009|p=196}} Songwriter [[Robert Maxwell (songwriter)|Robert Maxwell]]'s "Solfeggio" became associated with the derby-hatted apes; '[[The Nairobi Trio]]'. 

In the 1982 TV special ''Ernie Kovacs: Television's Original Genius'', [[Edie Adams]] recalled that when Kovacs first heard the melody, he immediately knew what he wanted to do with it, creating a music-box-like trio that moved in time to the tune.&lt;ref name=genius&gt;{{cite AV media|
title=Ernie Kovacs: Television's Original Genius|date=November 17, 1982|publisher=JSC Productions|type=TV program}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kovacs was introduced to the song in 1954 by Barry Shear, his director at DuMont Television Network.&lt;ref name=Moderation&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zzXtobwmRZAC&amp;pg=PA46&amp;dq=ernie+kovacs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=I0KoU9esIumV8gGs5oCwAg&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=ernie%20kovacs&amp;f=false|title=Ernie Kovacs &amp; Early TV Comedy: Nothing in Moderation|editor-last=Horton|editor-first=Andrew|year=2010|publisher=University of Texas|accessdate=June 23, 2014|isbn=9780292779624|pages=46–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ernie Kovacs 1961.JPG|left|thumb|150px|Kovacs in 1961]]
Kovacs matched an unusual treatment of "[[Sentimental Journey (song)|Sentimental Journey]]", by Mexican bandleader [[Juan García Esquivel]] to video of an empty office in which various items (pencil sharpeners, water coolers, wall clocks) come to life in rhythm with the music; it was a variation on several famous animations of a decade earlier.&lt;ref name="Series"/&gt;{{sfn|Greene|2007|p=64}} The original three-minute presentation was outlined by Kovacs in a four-page, single-spaced memo to his staff. The perfectionist Kovacs describes in minute detail what had to be done and how to do it. The memo ends with this: "I don't know how the hell you're going to get this done by Sunday – but 'rots of ruck." (signed) "Ernie (with love)".{{sfn|Spigel|2009|p=194}} Kovacs also made careful use of the shrill singer Leona Anderson—who had somewhat less than a classical (or even listenable) voice, by some estimations—in comic vignettes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spaceagepop.com/andersonl.htm|title=Leona Anderson|publisher=Space Age Pop|accessdate=August 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kovacs used classical music as background for silent skits or abstract visual routines, including "Concerto for Orchestra", by [[Béla Bartók]]; music from the opera "[[The Love of Three Oranges]]", by [[Sergei Prokofiev]]; the finale of [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s suite "[[The Firebird]]"; and [[Richard Strauss]]' "[[Till Eulenspiegels lustige Streiche|Till Eulenspiegel's Merry Pranks]]". He may have been known best for using [[Joseph Haydn]]'s "String Quartet, Opus 3, Number 5" (the "Serenade," actually composed by [[Roman Hoffstetter]]) for a series of 1960–61 commercials he created and videotaped for his sponsor, [[Dutch Masters (cigar)|Dutch Masters]].{{sfn|Spigel|2009|p=203}}

For the show of May 22, 1959, ''Kovacs on Music'', Kovacs began by saying, "I have never really understood classical music, so I would like to take this opportunity to explain it to others." He presented a gorilla version of ''Swan Lake'' which differed from the usual performance only in the persona of the dancers, along with giant paper clips moving to music and other sketches.&lt;ref name="Clowns"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Theory"&gt;{{Cite book|editor-last=Shepherdson|editor-first=K.

He also served as host on a [[jazz]] album to benefit the [[American Cancer Society]] in 1957, ''Listening to Jazz with Ernie Kovacs''. It was a 15-minute recording featuring some of the celebrities of the art, including pianist [[Jimmy Yancey]] and old original New Orleans Jazz Trumpeter[[Bunk Johnson]], soprano saxophonist [[Sidney Bechet]], guitarist [[Django Reinhardt]], composer/pianist/bandleader [[Duke Ellington]] and longtime Ellington trumpeter [[Cootie Williams]].

==In print==
Kovacs wrote a novel, ''Zoomar: A Sophisticated Novel about Love and TV'' (Doubleday, 1957), based on television pioneer [[Pat Weaver]]; it took Kovacs only 13 days to write.&lt;ref name="Pasture"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/13846151/news_specials_1959/|page=24|title=Rennick Plans News Specials|author=Dunn, Kristine|date=July 20, 1959|publisher=The Miami News|accessdate=November 12, 2010|via = [[Newspapers.com]]}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1960 interview, Edie Adams related that the novel was written after Kovacs's experiences with network television while he was preparing to broadcast the ''Silent Show''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=kG4pAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=lswEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=881,2773436&amp;dq=edie+adams+silent&amp;hl=en|title=Edie Adams Laments Decline of Satire|date=February 16, 1960|author=Thomas, Bob|publisher=Daytona Beach Morning Journal|accessdate=November 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1961 British edition was retitled ''T.V.

While he worked on several other book projects, Kovacs's only other published title was ''How to Talk at Gin'', published posthumously in 1962. He intended part of the book's proceeds to benefit [[Cedars-Sinai Medical Center]].&lt;ref name="Last"/&gt; During 1955–58, he wrote for ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' (his favorite humor magazine), including the feature "Strangely Believe It!" (a parody of ''[[Ripley's Believe It or Not!]]'' that was a regular feature of his television shows) and ''Gringo'', a [[board game]] with ridiculously complicated rules that was renamed ''Droongo'' for the television show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buffalonews.com/editorial-page/from-our-readers/my-view/article29138.ece|title=Persistence pays off at the dreaded DMV|author=Schwartz, Dan|date=August 12, 2010|publisher=BuffaloNews.com|accessdate=November 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kovacs also wrote the introduction to the 1958 collection ''Mad For Keeps: A Collection of the Best from Mad Magazine''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Collectibly-Mad-Ec-Collectibles-Guide/dp/087816202X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1343713764&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=087816202X|title=Collectibly Mad: The Mad and Ec Collectibles Guide|editor-last=Geissman|editor-first=Grant|publisher=Kitchen Sink Press|year=1995|pages=320|isbn=087816202X|accessdate=July 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Television guest star==
[[File:Ernie GE.JPG|thumb|130px|Kovacs as Barney Colby, the super detective, 1959]]
Kovacs and Edie Adams guest starred on what turned out to be the final episode of ''[[The Lucille Ball-Desi Arnaz Show]]'', (syndicated as ''[[The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour]]'' or ''[[We Love Lucy]]'') "Lucy Meets the Moustache" which was in rehearsals the week of February 28 and filmed March 3 for an April 1, 1960, network broadcast. "Lucy Meets the Moustache" was the last time Arnaz and Ball worked together and the last time their famous characters appeared in a first-run broadcast.  According to Adams, Ball and Arnaz 'avoided contact and barely talked to each other in rehearsals and in-between scenes'.  Adams also said that they were not told their episode was the last or that the famous couple were to divorce (Ball entered the uncontested divorce request March 4, 1960).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|editor-last=Kanfer|editor-first=Stefan|title=Ball of fire: the tumultuous life and comic art of Lucille Ball|publisher=Alfred A.

Kovacs also appeared in roles on other television programs. For ''[[General Electric Theater]]'s'' "I Was a Bloodhound" in 1959, Kovacs played the role of detective Barney Colby, whose extraordinary sense of smell helped him solve many seemingly impossible cases. Colby was hired by a foreign country to recover their symbol of royalty, a baby elephant, who was being held for ransom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/466645/I-Was-a-Bloodhound/|title=I Was a Bloodhound|publisher=Turner Classic Movies|accessdate=October 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Films==
Kovacs found Hollywood success as a character actor, often typecast as a swarthy military officer (almost always a "Captain" of some sort) in such movies as ''[[Operation Mad Ball]]'', ''[[Wake Me When It's Over (film)|Wake Me When It's Over]]'', and ''[[Our Man in Havana (film)|Our Man in Havana]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0468237/|title=Ernie Kovacs|publisher=Internet Movie Database|accessdate=September 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; While working in his first movie role for ''Operation Mad Ball'', Kovacs was filming a wild party scene after midnight; it was decided to use real champagne for realism.  After a few hours of work, someone came up to Kovacs and remarked that he had been having quite a good time chasing starlets all night. Kovacs told the stranger to go to hell, since he was following the script; he later learned the stranger was [[Harry Cohn]], head of Columbia Pictures.  Kovacs and Cohn later became friends despite the way they had first met, with Cohn giving Kovacs roles in ''[[Bell, Book and Candle]]'' (1958) and ''[[It Happened to Jane]]'' (1959).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/1524203/kovacs_spends_money_quickly/|title=Ernie Kovacs Expert at Spending Cash|author=Bacon, James|page=27|date=September 4, 1960|publisher=The Oregon Statesman|accessdate=January 6, 2015|via = [[Newspapers.com]]}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He garnered critical acclaim for movie roles such as the perennially inebriated writer in ''Bell, Book and Candle'' and as the cartoonishly evil head of a railroad company (who resembled [[Orson Welles]]' title character in ''[[Citizen Kane]]'') in ''[[It Happened to Jane]]'', where he had his head shaved and his remaining hair dyed grey for the role.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=OK4xAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=q-IFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5129,2846809&amp;dq=kovacs+shaves+head&amp;hl=en|title=Kovacs Gets A New (Wide) Part|date=October 11, 1958|publisher=Ottawa Citizen|accessdate=July 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/13845012/ernie_kovacs/|page=12|title=Kovacs Enjoys New Anonymity|date=August 8, 1958|publisher=Miami News|accessdate=July 10, 2010||via = [[Newspapers.com]]}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1960, he played the base commander Charlie Stark in the comedy ''[[Wake Me When It's Over (film)|Wake Me When It's Over]]'' and the con man Frankie Cannon trying to steal [[John Wayne]]'s gold mine in the western comedy, ''[[North to Alaska]]''. His own personal favorite was said to have been the offbeat ''[[Five Golden Hours]]'' (1961), in which he portrayed a larcenous professional mourner who meets his match in a professional widow played by [[Cyd Charisse]]. Kovacs's last movie, ''[[Sail a Crooked Ship]]'' (also 1961), was released one month before his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055394/|title=Sail A Crooked Ship|date=December 1961|publisher=Internet Movie Database|accessdate=August 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

===First marriage===
Kovacs and his first wife, Bette Wilcox, were married on August 13, 1945. When the marriage ended, he fought for custody of their children, Elizabeth ("Bette") and Kip Raleigh ("Kippie"). The court awarded Kovacs full custody upon determining that his former wife was mentally unstable.&lt;ref name="Charges"/&gt; The decision was extremely unusual at the time, setting a [[legal precedent]]. Wilcox subsequently kidnapped the children, taking them to Florida.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=wiEhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=3GQEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1402,4911650&amp;dq=ernie+kovacs&amp;hl=en|title=Grandmother Again Held on Kidnapping|date=January 28, 1954|publisher=Sarasota Herald-Tribune|accessdate=July 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a long and expensive search, Kovacs regained custody.

Kovacs's first wife made a legal attempt to gain custody of her two daughters soon after his death.

Kovacs and Adams met in 1951 when she was hired to work for his WPTZ show, ''Three to Get Ready''.&lt;ref name="Pioneers"/&gt; Her appearance on ''Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts'' caught the eye of Kovacs's producer, and he asked her to audition for the program.  A classically trained singer, she was able to perform only three popular songs. Edie said later, "I sang them all during the audition, and if they had asked to hear another, I never would have made it."&lt;ref name="CBS"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/oct/17/local/me-adams17|title=Tony award-winning actress, TV star|author=Thurber, Jon|date=October 17, 2008|publisher=LA Times|accessdate=August 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quoting Kovacs, "I wish I could say I was the big shot that hired her, but it was my show in name only – the producer had all the say.

After the couple's first date, Kovacs proceeded to buy a [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]] car, telling Adams he wanted to take her out in style.

Adams booked a six-week European cruise which she hoped would let her make up her mind whether or not to marry Kovacs.  After only three days away and many long-distance telephone calls, she curtailed her trip and returned to say "yes".&lt;ref name="Clowns"&gt;{{Cite book|editor-last=Adir|editor-first=Karin|title=The Great Clowns of American Television|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company|year=2001|pages=270|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5jr9L--C4tMC&amp;pg=PA169&amp;dq=edie+adams#v=onepage&amp;q=edie%20adams&amp;f=false|isbn=0-7864-1303-4|accessdate=July 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Edie"/&gt; They eloped and were married on September 12, 1954, in [[Mexico City]].&lt;ref name="CBS"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/10/16/entertainment/main4526492.shtml|title=Tony-Winning Actress Edie Adams Dead at 81|date=October 16, 2008|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=August 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ceremony was presided over by former New York City mayor [[William O'Dwyer]] and was performed in Spanish, which neither Kovacs nor Adams understood; O'Dwyer had to prompt each of them to say ''"Sí"'' at the "I do" portion of the vows.&lt;ref name="Edie"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Pa8zAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=oOgFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5269,3220593&amp;dq=ernie+kovacs&amp;hl=en|title=Nasty Old Civilian Food|author=Wilson, Earl|date=September 17, 1954|publisher=Miami News|accessdate=July 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adams, who had a middle class upbringing, was smitten by Kovacs's quirky ways; the couple remained together until his death. (She later said about Kovacs, "He treated me like a little girl, and I loved it—[[Women's Lib]] be damned!")&lt;ref name="Edie"/&gt;

Adams also aided Kovacs's struggle to reclaim his two older children after the kidnapping by their mother. She also was a regular partner on his television shows. Kovacs usually introduced or addressed her in a businesslike way, as "Edith Adams". Adams was usually willing to do anything he envisioned, whether it was singing seriously, performing impersonations (including a well-regarded impression of [[Marilyn Monroe]]), or taking a pie in the face or a [[pratfall]] if and when needed. The couple had one daughter, Mia Susan Kovacs, born June 20, 1959.&lt;ref name="Joe"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=KXhVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Jz8NAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2325,4002722&amp;dq=ernie+kovacs&amp;hl=en|title=Littlest Star for the Kovacs|date=June 29, 1959|publisher=The Miami News|accessdate=March 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kovacs and his family shared a 16-room apartment in Manhattan on Central Park West that seemed perfect until he went to California for his first movie role in ''Operation Mad Ball''.&lt;ref name=LifeMagazine&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=XEoEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA167&amp;dq=kovacs+source:life+intitle:life+intitle:magazine#v=onepage&amp;q=kovacs%20source%3Alife%20intitle%3Alife%20intitle%3Amagazine&amp;f=false|title=An Electronic Funnyman And His TV Tricks|date=April 15, 1957|publisher=Life|accessdate=October 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The experience of the totally different, laid-back lifestyle of Hollywood made a big impression on him.&lt;ref name="Something"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=9z1QAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=JlcDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6026,3710229&amp;dq=ernie+kovacs+californian&amp;hl=en|title=Something Special About Ernie Kovacs|author=Hoffman, Leonard|date=September 26, 1961|publisher=The Evening Independent|accessdate=October 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He realized he was working too much in New York; in California he would be able to work fewer hours, do just as well or better, and have more time for Edie and his daughters.

==Death==
Kovacs was killed in a car accident in Los Angeles during the early morning hours of January 13, 1962. Kovacs, who had worked for much of the evening, met Adams at a baby shower given by [[Billy Wilder]] for [[Milton Berle]] and his wife, who had recently adopted a newborn baby boy. The couple left the party in separate cars.&lt;ref name="Victoria"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HSMcAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=vFgEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6745,1128022&amp;dq=ernie+kovacs&amp;hl=en|title=Comedian Ernie Kovacs Is Killed in Traffic Accident|date=January 14, 1962|publisher=Victoria Advocate|accessdate=August 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a light southern California rainstorm, Kovacs lost control of his [[Chevrolet Corvair]] station wagon while turning quickly, and crashed into a power pole at the corner of Beverly Glen and Santa Monica Boulevards. He was thrown halfway out the passenger side, and died almost instantly from chest and head injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Cl4bAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=rU4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7413,3280246&amp;dq=ernie+kovacs&amp;hl=en|title=Show World Mourns Death of Kovacs|date=January 14, 1962|publisher=Pittsburgh Press|accessdate=August 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A photographer managed to arrive moments later, and graphic images of Kovacs's dead body appeared in newspapers across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gOcrAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=QWcFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1299,2680763&amp;dq=ernie+kovacs&amp;hl=en|title=The Voice of Broadway|author=Kilgallen, Dorothy|date=June 4, 1962|publisher=Kentucky New Era|accessdate=October 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HlcxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=GuUFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4929,1003149&amp;dq=ernie+kovacs&amp;hl=en|title='The Kovacs Picture' and 'More on the Photo'|date=January 17, 1962|publisher=Lawrence Journal-World|accessdate=October 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; An unlit cigar lay on the pavement, inches from his outstretched arm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/thedailymirror/files/1962_january_13_kovacs.jpg|title=Crash Kills Ernie Kovacs|date=January 13, 1962|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=November 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Years later, in a documentary about Kovacs, Edie Adams described telephoning the police impatiently when she learned of the crash. An official cupped his hand over the receiver, saying to a colleague, "It's Mrs. Kovacs, he's on his way to the coroner – what should I tell her?" With that, Adams's fears were confirmed, and she became inconsolable. Jack Lemmon, who also attended the Berle party, identified Kovacs's body at the morgue because Adams was too distraught to do so.&lt;ref name="Victoria"/&gt; 

After attending funerals for Hollywood friends, Kovacs had expressed his wishes to Adams that any funeral services for him be kept simple.&lt;ref name="Last"/&gt; In keeping with his request, Adams made arrangements for Presbyterian services at the Beverly Hills Community Presbyterian Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=I-cuAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=aTEDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6332,4303182&amp;dq=ernie+kovacs&amp;hl=en|title=Hollywood Pays Its Final Respects to Ernie Kovacs|date=January 16, 1962|publisher=Rome News-Tribune|accessdate=August 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The active pallbearers were [[Jack Lemmon]], [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Dean Martin]], [[Billy Wilder]], [[Mervyn LeRoy]], and Joe Mikolas.

I've been smoking cigars ever since." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=i0ALAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=JlIDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5477,2629365&amp;dq=ernie+kovacs&amp;hl=en|title=Star-Studded Assembly Attends Kovacs' Funeral|date=January 15, 1962|publisher=St. Petersburg Times|accessdate=August 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tax evasion==
A frequent critic of the U.S. tax system, Kovacs owed the [[Internal Revenue Service]] several hundred thousand dollars in back taxes, due to his simple refusal to pay the bulk of them. Up to 90% of his earnings were [[garnishment|garnished]] as a result.&lt;ref name="LoC"/&gt; His long battles with the IRS inspired Kovacs to invest his money in a convoluted series of paper corporations in the U.S. and Canada. He would give them bizarre names, such as "The Bazooka Dooka Hicka Hocka Hookah Company".&lt;ref name="Joe"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.erniekovacs.info/JoeMikolas.html|title=Conversations with Joe Mikolas|publisher=erniekovacs.info|accessdate=July 12, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110314083350/http://www.erniekovacs.info/JoeMikolas.html|archivedate=March 14, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961, Kovacs was served with a $75,000 lien for back taxes; that same day he bought the California Racquet Club with the apparent hope of being able to use it as a tax write-off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=YGcUAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=EgEEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5928,847085&amp;dq=ernie+kovacs+california&amp;hl=en|title=The Lyons Den|author=Lyons, Leonard|date=July 8, 1961|publisher=Toledo Blade|accessdate=November 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The property had mortgages at the time of purchase which were later paid by Edie Adams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=FT4yAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=W-UFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7012,2583035&amp;dq=ernie+kovacs&amp;hl=en|title=Edie Adams Once Advised Ernie To Forego Deals Until Return|author=Lyons, Leonard|date=August 6, 1962|publisher=Lawrence Journal-World|accessdate=October 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Racquet"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=kJA0AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=edUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3199,1903667&amp;dq=ernie+kovacs&amp;hl=en|title=A New World for Edie Adams|date=November 18, 1962|publisher=Gadsden Times|author=Ryan, Jack|accessdate=October 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His tax woes also affected Kovacs's career, forcing him to take any offered work to pay his debt.&lt;ref name="Seriously"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=86Kntp6Kas8C&amp;pg=PA93&amp;dq=ernie+kovacs+taxes#v=onepage&amp;q=ernie%20kovacs%20taxes&amp;f=false|title=Heritage Auctions #7004|publisher=Heritage Auctions|accessdate=October 25, 2010|isbn=9781599673370|date=January 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This included the ABC game show ''[[Take a Good Look (TV series)|Take a Good Look]]'', appearances on variety shows such as [[NBC]]'s ''[[The Ford Show|The Ford Show, Starring Tennessee Ernie Ford]]'', and some of his less memorable movie roles. He also filmed an unaired 1962 pilot episode for a proposed CBS series, ''Medicine Man'' (co-starring Buster Keaton, pilot episode titled "A Pony for Chris"). Kovacs's role was that of Dr. P. Crookshank, a traveling medicine salesman in the 1870s selling Mother McGreevy's Wizard Juice, also known as "man's best friend in a bottle".&lt;ref name="Last"&gt;{{cite news|date=February 8, 1962|author=Spiro, J.D.|title=Ernie Kovacs' Last Interview|publisher=The Milwaukee Journal|accessdate=October 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was abandoned after his death, which occurred the day after filming some scenes for the pilot in [[Griffith Park]].

Some of the issues regarding Kovacs's tax problems were still unresolved years after his death. Kovacs had purchased two insurance policies in 1951; his mother was named as the primary beneficiary of them. The IRS placed a lien against them both for their cash value in 1961. To stop the actions being taken against her, Mary Kovacs had to go to Federal court. The court's early 1966 ruling resolved the issue, with the last sentence of the document reading: "Prima facie, it looks as if, within the limits of discretion permitted the government by the relevant statutes, an injustice is being done Mary Kovacs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ftp.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F2/355/355.F2d.349.19953_1.html|title=Mary KOVACS, Appellant, v.

Kovacs was an estimated $500,000 in debt.&lt;ref name=cult/&gt;}}

==Lost and surviving work==
Most of Kovacs's early television work was performed live: few [[kinescopes]] have survived. Some [[videotapes]] of his ABC specials were preserved; others, such as his quirky game show, ''Take a Good Look'', were available mostly in short segments until recently, with the release of some complete, videotaped episodes. &lt;ref name="Clowns"/&gt; After Kovacs's death, Adams discovered not only that her husband owed ABC a great deal of money, but that some networks were systematically erasing and reusing tapes of Kovacs's shows or disposing the kinescopes and videotapes in New York Bay. She succeeded in purchasing the rights to surviving footage with the proceeds from Kovacs's insurance policy and her own earnings after Kovacs's IRS debts were paid.&lt;ref name="IRS"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/columnists/19980801roddy.asp|title=Edie Hits a High Note|author=Roddy, Dennis|date=August 1, 1998|publisher=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|accessdate=July 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Special"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=rZkiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=y6oFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2689,7886996&amp;dq=ernie+kovacs&amp;hl=en|title=Edie Adams Arranges Ernie Kovacs' Special|author=Thomas, Bob|date=March 27, 1968|publisher=Sumter Daily Item|accessdate=July 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1996, Adams detailed her experiences before the [[National Film Preservation Board]].&lt;ref name="LoC"&gt;{{Cite web| last =Adams| first =Edie| authorlink =Edie Adams| author2 =| title =Television/Video Preservation Study: Los Angeles Public Hearing| work =National Film Preservation Board| publisher =Library of Congress| date =March 6, 1996| url =https://www.loc.gov/programs/static/national-film-preservation-board/documents/tvadams.pdf| doi =| accessdate =July 10, 2010}} ([[PDF]])&lt;/ref&gt;

Adams first used some of the videotapes she had purchased for a 1968 ABC television special, ''The Comedy of Ernie Kovacs''; to produce the show, she hired Kovacs's former producer and editor. The hour-long program was sponsored by Kovacs's former sponsor, Dutch Masters.&lt;ref name=cult&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/?spot=1523438|title=Kovacs Cult May Be In Making|author=Klemsrud, Judy|publisher=Corpus-Christi Caller-Times|date=April 7, 1968|page=81|accessdate=January 5, 2015|via = [[Newspapers.com]]}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/4710895/edie_saved_ernies_tapes/|title=Edie Saved Ernie's Tapes|date=March 31, 1968|page=30|publisher=The Independent Record |accessdate=March 23, 2016|via = [[Newspapers.com]]}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1984 television movie ''[[Ernie Kovacs: Between the Laughter]]'' helped return Kovacs to the public's attention, though the show emphasized his bid to retrieve his kidnapped children instead of his professional life. [[Jeff Goldblum]] portrayed Kovacs, [[Madolyn Smith]] portrayed Bette and [[Melody Anderson]] portrayed Adams in the movie.  Edie Adams appeared in a cameo in this movie, playing [[Mae West]]; it was one of the impressions she performed in shows with Kovacs.&lt;ref name="Between"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/15987/Ernie-Kovacs-Between-the-Laughter/overview |title=Movies-Ernie Kovacs: Between the Laughter |year=1984 |publisher=New York Times |accessdate=July 11, 2010 |first=Stephen |last=Farber |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xGMgwrPV?url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/15987/Ernie-Kovacs-Between-the-Laughter/overview |archivedate=March 17, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=beYNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=G24DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7159,3233920&amp;dq=ernie+kovacs&amp;hl=en|title=Edie Adams Has Part in Kovacs Revival|date=May 14, 1984|publisher=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|accessdate=July 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/13844599/ernie_kovacs_vegas_star/|title=Ernie Kovacs Vegas Star|date=November 29, 1957|page=17|author=Wilson, Earl|publisher=Miami News|accessdate=July 11, 2010|via = [[Newspapers.com]]}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Telecasts of edited compilations of some of his work by [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] (station [[WTTW]], Chicago) under the title ''The Best of Ernie Kovacs'' in 1977, inspired the movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ObU0AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=y2gFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3234,7194044&amp;dq=ernie+kovacs&amp;hl=en|title=Old Ernie Kovacs Films Returning|author=Sharbutt, Jay|date=June 5, 1976|publisher=Kentucky New Era|accessdate=July 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; These broadcasts were made available on VHS and DVD. The DVD set features extras that are not in the VHS set. The series was narrated by Jack Lemmon.

During the early 1990s, [[The Comedy Channel (USA)|The Comedy Channel]] broadcast a series of Kovacs's shows under the generic title of ''The Ernie Kovacs Show''. The series included both the ABC specials and some of his 1950s shows from NBC. By 2008, there were no broadcast, cable, or satellite channels broadcasting any of Kovacs's television work, other than his panel appearances on ''What's My Line?'' on the [[Game Show Network]]. {{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

On April 19, 2011, [[Shout! Factory]] released ''The Ernie Kovacs Collection'', six DVDs spanning Kovacs's television career. The company's website also offers an extra disc with material from ''[[The Tonight Show|Tonight!]]'' and ''The Ernie Kovacs Show'', as well as a rare color kinescope of the complete 30-minute, 1957 NBC color broadcast featuring "Eugene".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shoutfactorystore.com/prod.aspx?pfid=5257356|title=Ernie Kovacs Collection|publisher=Shout Factory|accessdate=January 12, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110117025038/http://www.shoutfactorystore.com/prod.aspx?pfid=5257356|archivedate=January 17, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 23, 2012, Shout!

In 1961, Kovacs recorded a record album of poetry in the character of Percy Dovetonsils named ''Percy Dovetonsils Thpeath'', but was unable to release it due to contractual obligations with other record companies. After he was given the masters, Kovacs donated them to a Los Angeles area hospital. Adams was able to re-acquire the tapes in 1967, and they remained part of her private collection until her death in 2008. The tapes were labeled as movie material and were thought to be such until further examination proved they were Kovacs as Percy reading his poems with no music background. The album was finally released in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/percy-dovetonsilsthpeaks-mw0002371641|title=Percy Dovetonsils Thpeakth|author=Kovacs, Ernie|publisher=Omnivore|year=2012|accessdate=September 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/culture/2012/04/5782320/prescient-avant-garde-comedy-ernie-kovacs-and-edie-adams-recovered-c|title=The prescient, avant-garde comedy of Ernie Kovacs and Edie Adams, recovered classics of early television|author=Matos, Michaelangelo|date=April 27, 2012|publisher=Capital New York|accessdate=September 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Percy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.erniekovacs.info/percy_d.html|title=Perthy Dovetonthils Thpeakth|publisher=erniekovacs.info|accessdate=July 12, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110314083420/http://www.erniekovacs.info/percy_d.html|archivedate=March 14, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastpioneers.com/kovacsinphilly.html|title=Ernie Kovacs-WPTZ|year=2005|publisher=Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia|accessdate=July 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
