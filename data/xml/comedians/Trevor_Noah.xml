== Influences ==
Noah has said of his comedic influences, "The kings are indisputable. [[Richard Pryor]], [[Bill Cosby|[Bill] Cosby]]; for me personally I didn't know of him before I started comedy but [[Eddie Murphy]] changed my view on the thing and I definitely look up to him as a comedic influence. [[Chris Rock]] in terms of the modern black comedian and [[Dave Chappelle]].

He didn’t say, 'You need to make my show.' He specifically said: 'Make your show. Make your best version of it.' I apply those teachings of Jon’s to everything that I’m doing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/27/arts/television/trevor-noah-daily-show-jon-stewart.html|title=Trevor Noah on ‘The Daily Show’ and His ‘Jewish Yoda,’ Jon Stewart|work=The New York Times|first=Dave|last=Itzkoff|date=September 23, 2017|accessdate=November 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992 Noah's mother Patricia Nombuyiselo was married to Ngisaveni Abel Shingange, and they had two sons together, Andrew and Isaac.
