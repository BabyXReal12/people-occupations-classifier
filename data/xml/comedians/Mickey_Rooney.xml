'''Mickey Rooney''' (born '''Joseph Yule Jr.'''; September 23, 1920 – April 6, 2014) was an American actor, vaudevillian, comedian, producer and radio personality. In a career spanning nine decades and continuing until shortly before his death, he appeared in more than 300 films and was one of the last surviving stars of the silent film era.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/movies/2014/04/07/rooney/coAEzsSNMsl3jNIE2EzqNP/story.html "Mickey Rooney, an enduring star"], ''Boston Globe'', April 7, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

At the height of a career that was marked by precipitous declines and raging comebacks, Rooney performed the role of [[Andy Hardy]] in a series of 15 films in the 1930s and 1940s that epitomized American family values. A versatile performer, he became a celebrated character actor later in his career. [[Laurence Olivier]] once said he considered Rooney "the best there has ever been."&lt;ref name="THR" /&gt; [[Clarence Brown]], who directed him in two of his earliest dramatic roles, ''[[National Velvet (film)|National Velvet]]'' and ''[[The Human Comedy (film)|The Human Comedy]]'', said he was "the closest thing to a genius I ever worked with."&lt;ref&gt;[http://dfw.cbslocal.com/2014/04/07/iconic-actor-mickey-rooney-dies-at-93 "Iconic Actor Mickey Rooney Dies At 93"], CBS News, April 7, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rooney first performed in [[vaudeville]] as a child and made his film debut at the age of six. At 14 he played [[Puck (A Midsummer Night's Dream)|Puck]] in the play and later the 1935 film adaptation of [[A Midsummer Night's Dream (1935 film)|''A Midsummer Night's Dream'']]. Critic [[David Thomson (film critic)|David Thomson]] hailed his performance as "one of the cinema's most arresting pieces of magic". In 1938, he co-starred in [[Boys Town (film)|''Boys Town'']]. At nineteen he was the first teenager to be nominated for an Oscar for his leading role in ''[[Babes in Arms (film)|Babes in Arms]]'', and he was awarded a special [[Academy Juvenile Award]] in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-mickey-rooney-career-20140407,0,3547872,full.story#axzz2yVrN04QO|title=Mickey Rooney: A long and remarkable career in film, TV|author=Los Angeles Times|work=latimes.com|date=April 7, 2014|accessdate=November 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the peak of his career between the ages of 15 and 25, he made 43 films, which made him one of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]'s most consistently successful actors and a favorite of MGM studio head [[Louis B. Mayer]].

Rooney was the top box-office attraction from 1939 to 1941&lt;ref name="Vanity Fair – April 7, 2014" /&gt; and one of the best-paid actors of that era,&lt;ref name="THR" /&gt; but his career would never again rise to such heights. [[Conscription|Drafted]] into the Army during [[World War II]], he served nearly two years entertaining over two million troops on stage and radio and was awarded a [[Bronze Star]] for performing in combat zones. Returning from the war in 1945, he was too old for juvenile roles but too short to be an adult movie star, and was unable to get as many starring roles. Nevertheless, Rooney's popularity was renewed with well-received supporting roles in films such as ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's (film)|Breakfast at Tiffany's]]'' (1961), ''[[Requiem for a Heavyweight]]'' (1962), ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' (1963), and ''[[The Black Stallion (film)|The Black Stallion]]'' (1979). In the early 1980s, he returned to Broadway in [[Sugar Babies (musical)|''Sugar Babies'']] and again became a celebrated star. Rooney made hundreds of appearances on TV, including dramas, variety programs, and talk shows, and won an [[Emmy Awards|Emmy]] in 1964, with another Emmy plus a Golden Globe for his role in ''[[Bill (1981 film)|Bill]]'' (1981).

At his death, ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' called him "the original Hollywood train wreck."&lt;ref name="Vanity Fair – April 7, 2014"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sales|first1=Nancy Jo|title=Mickey Rooney Blew Through Wives and Fortunes, but God, What a Talent!|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/vf-hollywood/mickey-rooney-nancy-jo-sales|accessdate=January 27, 2015|work=Vanity Fair|date=April 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He struggled with alcohol and pill addiction. [[Ava Gardner]] was his first wife, and he would go on to marry an additional seven times. Despite earning millions during his career, he had to file for bankruptcy in 1962 due to mismanagement of his finances. Shortly before his death in 2014 at age 93, he alleged mistreatment by some family members and testified before Congress about what he alleged was physical abuse and exploitation by family members. By the end of his life, his millions in earnings had dwindled to an estate that was valued at only $18,000. He died owing medical bills and back taxes, and contributions were solicited from the public.&lt;ref name=LAT-burial-4-8-14&gt;{{cite news|title=Mickey Rooney's body goes unclaimed as family feuds over burial site|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-mickey-rooney-20140409,0,589697.story#axzz2yU967cOR|accessdate=April 10, 2014|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=April 8, 2014|author=Kim, Victoria|author2=Ryan, Harriet}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rooney website-appeal for funds"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Official Mickey Rooney Site|url=http://mickeyrooney.com|accessdate=April 11, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170609203621/http://mickeyrooney.com/|archive-date=June 9, 2017|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Rooney was born Joseph Yule, Jr. on September 23, 1920, in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]], the only child of [[vaudeville|vaudevillians]] Nellie W. Carter, from [[Kansas City, Missouri]] and [[Joe Yule]], a native of [[Glasgow]], Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Joe Yule, 55, Father Of Mickey Rooney |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1950/03/31/archives/joe-yule-55-father-of-mickey-rooney.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=31 March 1950 |url-access=subscription |access-date=28 May 2018 |page=30 |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother was a former chorus girl and a [[Burlesque|burlesque performer]].&lt;ref name="THR" /&gt; When Rooney was born, his parents were appearing in a Brooklyn production of ''[[A Gaiety Girl]]''. Rooney later recounted in his memoirs that he began performing at the age of 17 months as part of his parents' routine, wearing a specially tailored tuxedo.&lt;ref name="LifeTooShort"&gt;''Life Is Too Short'' (1991 autobiography); {{ISBN|978-0-679-40195-7}}&lt;!-- publishing info, page(s) needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WaPo-obit&gt;{{cite news|last=Bernstein|first=Adam|title=Mickey Rooney dies at 93|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/mickey-rooney-dies-at-93/2014/04/07/dc332718-be67-11e3-bcec-b71ee10e9bc3_story.html|accessdate=April 10, 2014|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=April 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lertzman&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lertzman|first1=Richard A.|last2=Birnes|first2=William J.|title=The Life and Times of Mickey Rooney|date=2015|publisher=Gallery Books|isbn=1-5011-0096-3|pages=24–27|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hrz_BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT78|accessdate=December 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===Child actor===
Rooney's parents separated when he was four years old in 1924, and he and his mother moved to [[Hollywood]] the following year. He made his first film appearance at age six in 1926, in the short ''Not to be Trusted''.&lt;ref name="THR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/mickey-rooneys-final-years-833325|title=Tears and Terror: The Disturbing Final Years of Mickey Rooney|author=Gary Baum and Scott Feinberg|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=([[Prometheus Global Media]])|date=October 21, 2015|accessdate=October 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CNN-4-7-14&gt;{{cite news|title=Legendary actor Mickey Rooney dies at 93|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/04/07/showbiz/mickey-rooney-obit|newspaper=CNN|date=April 7, 2014|accessdate=November 16, 2015|author=Duke, Alan|author2=Leopold, Todd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rooney got bit parts in films such as ''[[The Beast of the City]]'' (1932) and ''[[The Life of Jimmy Dolan]]'' (1933), which allowed him to work alongside stars such as [[Joel McCrea]], [[Colleen Moore]], [[Clark Gable]], [[Douglas Fairbanks Jr.]], [[John Wayne]] and [[Jean Harlow]]. He enrolled in the [[Hollywood Professional School]] and later attended [[Hollywood High School]], graduating in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seeing-stars.com/Schools/HPS.shtml Hollywood Professional School] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007103339/http://www.seeing-stars.com/schools/hps.shtml |date=October 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hollywoodhighschool.net/apps/pages/index.jsp?uREC_ID=63766&amp;type=d&amp;pREC_ID=108329 Hollywood High School, notable graduates]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mickey McGuire===
His mother saw an advertisement for a child to play the role of "Mickey McGuire" in a [[Mickey McGuire (film series)|series of short films]].&lt;ref name="current"&gt;''Current Biography 1942''. H.W. Wilson Co. (January 1942). pp. 704–06. {{ISBN|99903-960-3-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Rooney got the role and became "Mickey" for 78 of the comedies, running from 1927 to 1936, starting with ''Mickey's Circus'' (1927), his first starring role.{{efn|The film was long believed lost, but in 2014 was reported found in the Netherlands.&lt;ref name="Hollywood Reporter-3-30-14"&gt;{{cite news|last=Barnes|first=Mike|title=Lost Mickey Rooney Film Is Found and Set for Preservation|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/lost-mickey-rooney-film-found-692160|accessdate=April 4, 2014|newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter|date=March 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}{{efn|The Mickey McGuire films were adapted from the ''[[Toonerville Folks|Toonerville Trolley]]'' comic strip, which contained a character named Mickey McGuire. Joe Yule briefly became Mickey McGuire legally "trump an attempted copyright lawsuit so the film producer Larry Darmour would not have to pay the comic strip writers royalties" His mother also changed her surname to McGuire in an attempt to bolster the argument, but the film producers lost. The litigation settlement awarded damages to the owners of the cartoon character, compelling the twelve-year-old actor to refrain from calling himself Mickey McGuire on- and off-screen.&lt;ref&gt;Server, Lee, ''Ava Gardner - "Love is Nothing"'' (2006), St. Martin's Press&lt;!--ISSN/ISBN, page(s) needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="name change – 1930"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Coons|first1=Robbin|title=Mother of Mickey McGuire Seeks to Change Her Name|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/4009258/the_evening_review/|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate=January 10, 2016|work=The Evening Review|date=August 29, 1930|location=East Liverpool, Ohio}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;During an interruption in the series in 1932, Mrs. Yule made plans to take her son on a 10-week vaudeville tour as McGuire, and Fox sued successfully to stop him from using the name. Mrs. Yule suggested the stage name of Mickey Looney for her comedian son. He altered this to Rooney, which did not infringe upon the copyright of [[Warner Brothers]]' [[animation]] series called [[Looney Tunes]].&lt;ref name="current" /&gt;}} During this period, he also briefly voiced [[Oswald the Lucky Rabbit]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intanibase.com/gac/lantz/1931.aspx "The Walter Lantz Cartune Encyclopedia: 1931]. Retrieved 2018-06-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

He made other films in his adolescence, including several more of the McGuire films. At age 15 he played the role of Puck in the Warner Brothers all-star adaptation of [[A Midsummer Night's Dream (1935 film)|''A Midsummer Night's Dream'']] in 1935. Rooney then moved to MGM, where he befriended [[Judy Garland]], with whom he began making a series of musicals that propelled both of them to stardom.&lt;ref name=Krantz&gt;Krantz, Les.

===''Andy Hardy,'' ''Boys Town'' and Hollywood stardom===
[[File:Rooney-Garland-ebay-1938.jpg|thumb|Rooney with [[Judy Garland]] in ''[[Love Finds Andy Hardy]]'' (1938)]]
In 1937, Rooney was selected to portray [[Andy Hardy]] in ''[[A Family Affair (1937 film)|A Family Affair]]'', which MGM had planned as a [[B-movie]].&lt;ref name="current" /&gt; Rooney provided comic relief as the son of Judge James K. Hardy, portrayed by [[Lionel Barrymore]] (although [[Lewis Stone]] would play the role of Judge Hardy in subsequent films). The film was an unexpected success, and led to 13 more ''[[Andy Hardy]]'' films between 1937 and 1946, and a final film in 1958.

According to author Barry Monush, MGM wanted the Andy Hardy films to appeal to all family members. Rooney's character would portray a typical "anxious, hyperactive, girl-crazy teenager", and he soon became the unintended main star of the films. Although some critics describe the series of films as "sweet, overly idealized, and pretty much interchangeable," their ultimate success was because they gave viewers a "comforting portrait of small-town America that seemed suited for the times", with Rooney instilling "a lasting image of what every parent wished their teen could be like."&lt;ref name=Monush /&gt;

Behind the scenes, however, Rooney was like the "hyperactive girl-crazy teenager" he portrayed on the screen. [[Wallace Beery]], his co-star in ''[[Stablemates]]'', described him as a "brat", but a "fine actor".&lt;ref&gt;Marx, A. ''The Nine Lives of Mickey Rooney''. Stein and Day (1986), p. 68; {{ISBN|0-8128-3056-3}}.&lt;!-- year of publication?? --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; MGM head [[Louis B. Mayer]] found it necessary to manage Rooney's public image, explains historian Jane Ellen Wayne:

{{quote|Mayer naturally tried to keep all his child actors in line, like any father figure. After one such episode, Mickey Rooney replied, "I won't do it. You're asking the impossible." Mayer then grabbed young Rooney by his lapels and said, "Listen to me! I don't care what you do in private. Just don't do it in public. In public, behave. Your fans expect it. You're Andy Hardy! You're the United States! You're the Stars and Stripes. Behave yourself! You're a symbol!" Mickey nodded. "I'll be good, Mr. Mayer. I promise you that." Mayer let go of his lapels, "All right," he said.&lt;ref name=Wayne&gt;Wayne, Jane Ellen. ''The Leading Men of MGM'', Carroll &amp; Graf (2005) p. 246&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Fifty years later, Rooney realized in hindsight that these early confrontations with Mayer were necessary for him to develop into a leading film star: "Everybody butted heads with him, but he listened and you listened. And then you'd come to an agreement you could both live with.&amp;nbsp;... He visited the sets, he gave people talks&amp;nbsp;... What he wanted was something that was ''American'', presented in a [[Cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] manner."&lt;ref name=Eyman /&gt;{{rp|323}}

[[File:Mickey Rooney and Spencer Tracy.jpg|thumb|[[Spencer Tracy]] and Rooney in a scene from ''[[Boys Town (film)|Boys Town]]'' (1938)]]
In 1937, Rooney made his first film alongside [[Judy Garland]] with ''[[Thoroughbreds Don't Cry]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts/you_must_remember_this/2015/10/the_mgm_history_of_judy_garland_and_mickey_rooney.html "Judy and Mickey"], ''Slate'', October 30, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Garland and Rooney became close friends as they co-starred in future films and became a successful song-and-dance team. Audiences delighted in seeing the "playful interactions between the two stars showcase a wonderful chemistry."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2014/04/07/mickey_rooney_dead_at_93_remembering_the_star_with_some_of_his_best_musical.html "Remembering Mickey Rooney With a Few of His Greatest Musical Performances"], Slate.com, April 7, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with three of the ''Andy Hardy'' films, where she portrayed a girl attracted to Andy, they appeared together in a string of successful musicals, including ''[[Babes in Arms (film)|Babes in Arms]]'' (1939). During an interview in the 1992 documentary film ''MGM: When the Lion Roars'', Rooney describes their friendship:&lt;ref name="mgmrooneyquote"&gt;Rooney, Mickey. "The Lion Reigns Supreme", ''MGM: When the Lion Roars'', 1992 miniseries&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Judy and I were so close we could've come from the same womb. We weren't like brothers or sisters but there was no love affair there; there was more than a love affair. It's very, very difficult to explain the depths of our love for each other. It was so special. It was a forever love. Judy, as we speak, has not passed away. She's always with me in every heartbeat of my body.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1937, Rooney received top billing as Shockey Carter in ''Hoosier Schoolboy'' but his breakthrough-role as a dramatic actor came in 1938's ''[[Boys Town (1938 film)|Boys Town]]'' opposite [[Spencer Tracy]] as Father Flanagan, who runs a home for wayward and homeless boys. Rooney was awarded a special [[Academy Juvenile Award|Juvenile Academy Award]] in 1939, for "significant contribution in bringing to the screen the spirit and personification of youth."&lt;ref name=Lertzman/&gt;{{rp|161}}&lt;ref name="Oscars.org 2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/legacy/ceremony/11th.html|title=11th Academy Awards|accessdate=July 6, 2011|work=Oscars.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wayne describes one of the "most famous scenes" in the film, where tough young Rooney is playing poker with a cigarette in his mouth, his hat is cocked and his feet are up on the table. "Tracy grabs him by the lapels, throws the cigarette away and pushes him into a chair. 'That's better,' he tells Mickey."&lt;ref name=Wayne /&gt; Louis B. Mayer said ''Boys Town'' was his favorite film during his years at MGM.&lt;ref name=Lertzman/&gt;{{rp|161}}

The popularity of his films made Rooney the biggest box-office draw in 1939, 1940 and 1941.&lt;ref name="1939hgy"&gt;" By 1939 [Rooney] was the top box-office star in the world, a title he held for three consecutive years." [[Kenneth Branagh|Branagh, Kenneth]] (narrator). ''1939: Hollywood's Greatest Year''. [[Turner Classic Movies]], 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; For their roles in ''Boys Town'', Rooney and Tracy won first and second place in the ''Motion Picture Herald'' 1940 National Poll of Exhibitors, based on the box office appeal of 200 players. ''Boys' Life'' magazine wrote, "Congratulations to Messrs. Rooney and Tracy!

A major star in the early 1940s, he appeared on the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine in 1940, timed to coincide with the release of ''[[Young Tom Edison]]'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/3201/Young-Tom-Edison/articles.html|title=Young Tom Edison (1940)|publisher=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|accessdate=September 16, 2013|quote=''Time'' put Rooney on the cover, noting that his movies had grossed a whopping $30 million for MGM the previous year and praising him for 'his most sober and restrained performance to date' as young Edison, 'who (like himself) began at the bottom of the American heap, (like himself) had to struggle, (like himself) won, but a boy whose main activity (unlike Mickey's) was investigating, inventing, thinking.'}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Article (publishing)|cover story]] began:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,763693,00.html|title=Cinema: Success Story|date=March 18, 1940|publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate=September 16, 2013|quote=Hollywood's No. 1 box office bait in 1939 was not [[Clark Gable]], [[Errol Flynn]] or [[Tyrone Power]], but a rope-haired, kazoo-voiced kid with a comic-strip face, who until this week had never appeared in a picture without mugging or overacting it.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Hollywood's No. 1 box office bait in 1939 was not Clark Gable, Errol Flynn or Tyrone Power, but a rope-haired, kazoo-voiced kid with a comic-strip face, who until this week had never appeared in a picture without mugging or overacting it. His name (assumed) was Mickey Rooney, and to a large part of the more articulate U.S. cinema audience, his name was becoming a frequently used synonym for brat.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During his long and illustrious career, Rooney also worked with many of the screen's female stars, including [[Elizabeth Taylor]] in [[National Velvet (film)|''National Velvet'']] (1944) and [[Audrey Hepburn]] in [[Breakfast at Tiffany's (film)|''Breakfast at Tiffany's'']] (1961)."&lt;ref name=Huffington&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/04/06/mickey-rooney-dead_n_5102575.html "Mickey Rooney Dead: Legendary Actor Dies At 93"], ''Huffington Post'', April 7, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Rooney's "bumptiousness and boyish charm" as an actor would develop more "smoothness and polish" over the years, writes biographer [[Scott Eyman]]. The fact that Rooney fully enjoyed his life as an actor played a large role in those changes:

{{quote|You weren't going to work, you were going to have fun. It was home, everybody was cohesive; it was family. One year I made nine pictures; I had to go from one set to another. It was like I was on a conveyor belt. You did not read a script and say, "I guess I'll do it." ''You did it.'' They had people that knew the kind of stories that were suited to you. It was a conveyor belt that made motion pictures.&lt;ref name=Eyman&gt;Eyman, Scott. ''Lion of Hollywood: The Life and Legend of Louis B. Mayer'', Simon &amp; Schuster (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|224}}}}

[[Clarence Brown]], who directed Rooney in his Oscar-nominated performance in [[The Human Comedy (film)|''The Human Comedy'']] (1943) and again in ''National Velvet'' (1944), enjoyed working with Rooney in films:

{{quote|Mickey Rooney is the closest thing to a genius that I ever worked with. There was Chaplin, then there was Rooney. The little bastard could do no wrong in my book&amp;nbsp;... All you had to do with him was rehearse it once.&lt;ref&gt;Basinger, Jeanine. ''The Star Machine'', Alfred A. Knopf (2007) p. 442&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===World War II and career decline===
[[File:Mickey Rooney ww2 46.jpg|thumb|Rooney entertains American troops in Germany, April 1945]]
In June 1944, Rooney was inducted into the [[United States Army]], where &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://army.togetherweserved.com/army/servlet/tws.webapp.WebApps?cmd=ShadowBoxProfile&amp;type=Person&amp;ID=336424 |title= Rooney, Mickey, Pfc Deceased |work=TogetherWeServed |accessdate=June 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; he served more than 21 months (until shortly after the end of [[World War II]]) entertaining the troops in America and Europe in [[Special Services (entertainment)|Special Services]]. He spent part of the time as a radio personality on the [[American Forces Network]] and was awarded the [[Bronze Star Medal]] for entertaining troops in combat zones. In addition to the Bronze Star Medal, Rooney also received the [[Army Good Conduct Medal]], [[American Campaign Medal]], [[European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal]], and [[World War II Victory Medal]], for his military service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|pp=38–39|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q9UOBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA38|title=Pergolesi in the Pentagon|first=John S.|last=Bowman|publisher=[[Xlibris Corporation]]|year=2014|isbn=978-1-4990-3877-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h5WZOvH8VSUC&amp;pg=PA37|p=37|title=Mickey Rooney: His Films, Television Appearances, Radio Work, Stage Shows, and Recordings|first=Alvin H.|last=Marill|publisher=[[McFarland &amp; Company]]|year=2004|isbn=978-0-7864-2015-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lertzman/&gt;

Rooney's career slumped after his return to civilian life. He was now an adult with a height of only {{convert|5|ft|2|in|m}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/apr/07/mickey-rooney-obituary|title=Mickey Rooney obituary: women liked me because I made them laugh|date=April 7, 2014|work=The Guardian|accessdate=April 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he could no longer play the role of a teenager, but he also lacked the stature of most leading men. He appeared in a number of films, including ''[[Words and Music (1948 film)|Words and Music]]'' in 1948, which paired him for the last time with Garland on film (he appeared with her on one episode as a guest on ''[[The Judy Garland Show]]''). He briefly starred in a CBS radio series, ''Shorty Bell'', in the summer of 1948, and reprised his role as "Andy Hardy", with most of the original cast, in a syndicated radio version of ''The Hardy Family'' in 1949 and 1950 (repeated on [[Mutual Broadcasting System|Mutual]] during 1952).&lt;ref&gt;[[John Dunning (writer)|Dunning, John]], ''On The Air: The Encyclopedia Of Old-Time Radio'' (1998), [[Oxford University Press]]; accessed November 16, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1949 ''Variety'' reported that Rooney had renegotiated his deal with MGM. He agreed to make one film a year for them for five years at $25,000 a movie (his fee until then had been $100,000 but Rooney wanted to enter independent production.) Rooney claimed he was unhappy with the billing MGM gave him for ''Words and Music''.&lt;ref&gt;Staff (April 13, 1949) [https://archive.org/stream/variety174-1949-04#page/n65/mode/2up "Rooney's $25,000 Per Metro Picture; He's Out to Cash in on Own Prods."] ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' p.4&lt;/ref&gt;

His first television series, ''[[The Mickey Rooney Show]]'' (also known as ''Hey, Mulligan''; created by [[Blake Edwards]] with Rooney as his own producer), appeared on [[National Broadcasting Company|NBC]] television for 32 episodes between August 28, 1954, and June 4, 1955.&lt;ref name=Lertzman/&gt;{{rp|317}} In 1951, he made his directorial debut with ''My True Story,'' starring [[Helen Walker]].&lt;ref name=Lertzman/&gt;{{rp|413}} Rooney also starred as a ragingly egomaniacal television comedian, loosely based on [[Red Buttons]], in the live 90-minute television drama ''[[The Comedian (1957 TV drama)|The Comedian]]'', in the ''[[Playhouse 90]]'' series on the evening of [[Valentine's Day]] in 1957, and as himself in a [[revue]] called ''The Musical Revue of 1959'' based on the 1929 film ''[[The Hollywood Revue of 1929]]'', which was edited into a film in 1960.

In 1958, Rooney joined [[Dean Martin]] and [[Frank Sinatra]] in hosting an episode of NBC's short-lived ''[[Club Oasis]]'' comedy and variety show. In 1960, Rooney directed and starred in ''[[The Private Lives of Adam and Eve (film)|The Private Lives of Adam and Eve]]'', an ambitious comedy known for its multiple flashbacks and many cameos. In the 1960s, Rooney returned to theatrical entertainment. He still accepted film roles in undistinguished films but occasionally would appear in better works, such as ''[[Requiem for a Heavyweight]]'' (1962) and ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' (1963).

He portrayed a Japanese character, [[I.Y. Yunioshi|Mr. Yunioshi]], in the [[Breakfast at Tiffany's (film)|1961 film version]] of [[Truman Capote]]'s novella ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's (novella)|Breakfast at Tiffany's]]''. His performance was criticized by some in subsequent years as a [[racist]] stereotype.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Durant|first=Yvonne|title=Where Holly Hung Her Ever-So-Stylish Hat|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/18/nyregion/thecity/18holl.html|date=June 18, 2006|work=[[The New York Times]] - New York Observed| accessdate=October 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dargis|first=Manohla| authorlink= Manohla Dargis|title=Dude (Nyuck-Nyuck), I Love You (as If!)|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2007/07/20/movies/20pron.html|date=July 20, 2007|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=October 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rooney later said that he would not have taken the role if he had known it would offend people.&lt;ref name=Yang-4-8-14&gt;{{cite news|last=Yang|first=Jeff|title=The Mickey Rooney Role Nobody Wants to Talk Much About|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2014/04/08/the-mickey-rooney-role-nobody-wants-to-talk-about|accessdate=April 9, 2014|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=April 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 31, 1961, Rooney appeared on television's ''[[What's My Line]]'' and mentioned that he had already started enrolling students in the MRSE (Mickey Rooney School of Entertainment). His school venture never came to fruition. This was a period of professional distress for Rooney; as a childhood friend, director [[Richard Quine]] put it: "Let's face it. It wasn't all that easy to find roles for a 5-foot-3 man who'd passed the age of Andy Hardy."&lt;ref name=marx&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Arthur Marx]]|title=The Nine Lives of Mickey Rooney|year=1987|publisher=Berkley|location=New York|isbn=978-0-425-10552-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962, his debts had forced him into filing for bankruptcy.&lt;ref name=marill&gt;{{cite book|last=Marill|first=Alvin H.|title=Mickey Rooney: His Films, Television Appearances, Radio Work, Stage Shows, And Recordings|year=2005|publisher=McFarland|location=Jefferson NC|isbn=0-7864-2015-4|page=50|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h5WZOvH8VSUC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, Rooney was working on the film ''[[Ambush Bay]]'' in the [[Philippines]] when his wife Barbara Ann Thomason— a former model and aspiring actress who had won 17 straight beauty contests in Southern California—was found dead in her bed. Her lover, [[Milos Milos]]—who was one of Rooney's actor-friends—was found dead beside her. Detectives ruled it a [[murder-suicide]], which was committed with Rooney's own gun.&lt;ref name=Lertzman/&gt;{{rp|362}}

[[Francis Ford Coppola]] had bought the rights to make ''[[The Black Stallion (film)|The Black Stallion]]'' (1979), and when casting it, he called Rooney and asked him if he thought he could play a jockey. Rooney replied saying, "Gee, I don't know. I never played a jockey before." He was kidding, he said, since he had played a jockey in at least three past films, including ''Down the Stretch'', ''Thoroughbreds Don't Cry'', and ''National Velvet''.&lt;ref name=Lertzman/&gt;{{rp|450}} The film garnered excellent reviews and earned $40 million in its first run, which gave Coppola's struggling studio, [[American Zoetrope]], a major boost. It also gave Rooney newfound recognition, along with a nomination for Best Supporting Actor.&lt;ref name=Lertzman/&gt;{{rp|452}}

In 1983, the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] gave Rooney their [[Academy Honorary Award]] for his lifetime of achievement.&lt;ref name=Lertzman/&gt;{{rp|482}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/acting-legend-mickey-rooney-dead-age-93/story?id=23217449 "Legendary Actor Mickey Rooney Dead at 93"], ''ABC News'', April 7, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Character roles and Broadway comeback===

====Television roles====
[[File:Rooney Skelton 1962.JPG|thumb|Rooney and [[Red Skelton]] on ''[[The Red Skelton Show]]'' in 1962]]
In addition to his movie roles, Rooney made numerous guest-starring roles as a television [[character actor]] for nearly six decades, beginning with an episode of ''Celanese Theatre''. The part led to other roles on such television series as ''[[Schlitz Playhouse]]'',&lt;ref name=Lertzman/&gt;{{rp|542}} ''[[Playhouse 90]]'',&lt;ref name=Lertzman/&gt;{{rp|542}} ''Producers' Showcase'', ''[[Alcoa Theatre]]'',&lt;ref name=Lertzman/&gt;{{rp|542}} ''[[The Soldiers (TV series)|The Soldiers]]'', ''[[Wagon Train]]'', ''[[General Electric Theater]]'',&lt;ref name=Lertzman/&gt;{{rp|587}} ''[[Hennesey]]'',&lt;ref name=Lertzman/&gt;{{rp|486}} ''The [[Dick Powell]] Theatre'',&lt;ref name=Lertzman/&gt;{{rp|544}} ''[[Arrest and Trial]]'' (1964),&lt;ref name=Lertzman/&gt;{{rp|544}} ''[[Burke's Law (1963 TV series)|Burke's Law]]'' (1963),&lt;ref name=Lertzman/&gt;{{rp|542}} ''[[Combat!]]'' (1964),&lt;ref name=Lertzman/&gt;{{rp|544}} ''[[The Fugitive (TV series)|The Fugitive]]'', ''[[Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre]]'', ''[[The Jean Arthur Show]]'' (1966),&lt;ref name=Lertzman/&gt;{{rp|544}} ''[[The Name of the Game (ABBA song)|The Name of the Game]]'' (1970),&lt;ref name=Lertzman/&gt;{{rp|542}} ''[[Dan August]]'' (1970),&lt;ref name=Lertzman/&gt;{{rp|545}} ''[[Night Gallery]]'' (1970),&lt;ref name=Lertzman/&gt;{{rp|545}} ''[[The Love Boat]]'',&lt;ref name=Lertzman/&gt;{{rp|594}} ''[[Kung Fu: The Legend Continues]]'' (1995),&lt;ref name=Lertzman/&gt;{{rp|545}} ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'' (1992),&lt;ref name=Lertzman/&gt;{{rp|545}} [[The Golden Girls]] (1988)&lt;ref name=Lertzman/&gt;{{rp|545}} among many others.

In 1961, he guest-starred in the 13-week [[James Franciscus]] adventure–drama CBS television series ''[[The Investigators (American TV series)|The Investigators]]''.&lt;ref name=Lertzman/&gt;{{rp|544}} In 1962, he was cast as himself in the episode "The Top Banana" of the CBS sitcom, ''[[Pete and Gladys]]'',&lt;ref name=Lertzman/&gt;{{rp|542}} starring [[Harry Morgan]] and [[Cara Williams]].

In 1963, he entered CBS's ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'',&lt;ref name=Lertzman/&gt;{{rp|595}} giving a one-man performance in the episode "[[The Last Night of a Jockey]]" (1963).&lt;ref name=Lertzman/&gt;{{rp|544}} Also in 1963, in 'The Hunt' for ''[[Kraft Suspense Theatre|Suspense Theater]]'',&lt;ref name=Lertzman/&gt;{{rp|544}} he played the sadistic [[sheriff]] hunting the young surfer played by [[James Caan]]. In 1964, he launched another half-hour sitcom, ''[[Mickey (TV series)|Mickey]]''. The story line had "Mickey" operating a resort hotel in southern California. His own son [[Tim Rooney]] appeared as his character's teenage son on this program, and [[Emmaline Henry]] starred as Rooney's wife. The program lasted for 17 episodes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Marx]], ''The Nine Lives Of Mickey Rooney'' (1986), Stein &amp; Day&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed, page(s) needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Rooney garnered a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Mini-Series or Motion Picture Made for Television|Golden Globe]] and an [[Primetime Emmy Award|Emmy Award]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie|Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited Series or a Special]] for his role in 1981's ''[[Bill (1981 film)|Bill]]''. Playing opposite [[Dennis Quaid]], Rooney's character was a mentally handicapped man attempting to live on his own after leaving an institution. His acting quality in the film has been favorably compared to other actors who took on similar roles, including [[Sean Penn]], [[Dustin Hoffman]] and [[Tom Hanks]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/08/opinion/mickey-rooneys-quietest-role.html?emc=edit_ty_20140408&amp;nl=opinion&amp;nlid=68054278 "Mickey Rooney's Quietest Role"], ''The New York Times'', April 7, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; He reprised his role in 1983's ''Bill: On His Own'', earning an Emmy nomination for the turn.

Rooney did voice acting from time to time. He provided the voice of [[Santa Claus]] in four [[stop-motion]] animated Christmas TV specials: ''[[Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town (TV special)|Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town]]'' (1970), ''[[The Year Without a Santa Claus]]'' (1974),&lt;ref name=Lertzman/&gt;{{rp|540}} ''[[Rudolph and Frosty's Christmas in July]]'' (1979)&lt;ref name=Lertzman/&gt;{{rp|540}} and ''[[A Miser Brothers' Christmas]]'' (2008). In 1995, he appeared as himself on ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[Radioactive Man (The Simpsons episode)|Radioactive Man]]".&lt;ref name=Lertzman/&gt;{{rp|545}}

After starring in one unsuccessful TV series and turning down an offer for a huge TV series, Rooney, now 70, starred in 
[[The Family Channel (United States)|the Family Channel]]'s ''[[The Adventures of the Black Stallion]]'', where he reprised his role as Henry Dailey in the film of the same name, eleven years earlier.&lt;ref name=Lertzman/&gt;{{rp|594}} The series ran for three years and was an international hit.,&lt;ref name=Lertzman/&gt;{{rp|484}}

Rooney appeared in television commercials for [[Garden State Life Insurance Company]] in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEYSxh4ZdKk;t=1m18s |title=1/1/2002 Commercials Part 25 |work=[[YouTube]] |last=MightyFalcon2011 |first= |date=June 9, 2013 |accessdate=June 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Broadway shows====
A major turning point came in 1979, when Rooney made his [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] debut in the acclaimed stage play ''[[Sugar Babies (musical)|Sugar Babies]]'', a [[musical revue]] tribute to the [[burlesque]] era costarring former MGM dancing star [[Ann Miller]]. [[Aljean Harmetz]] noted that "Mr. Rooney fought over every skit and argued over every song and almost always got things done his way. The show opened on Broadway on October 8, 1979, to rave reviews, and this time he did not throw success away.&lt;ref name="Harmetz-obit-4-7-14"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/07/arts/mickey-rooney-master-of-putting-on-a-show-dies-at-93.html?ref=obituaries&amp;_r=0%20www.nytimes.com/2014/04/07%20Mickey%20Rooney%20master%20of%20putting%20on%20a%20show,%20dies%20at%2093|title=Mickey Rooney, Master of Putting On a Show, Dies at 93|work=The New York Times|date=April 7, 2014|accessdate=April 9, 2014|author=Harmetz, Aljean|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rooney and Miller performed the show 1,208 times in New York and then toured with it for five years, including eight months in London.&lt;ref&gt;Video: {{YouTube|TIrWvUYnbiA|"Ann Miller and Mickey Rooney at the Palladium, 1988"}} 8 min.&lt;/ref&gt; Co-star Miller recalls that Rooney "never missed a performance or a chance to ad-lib or read the lines the same way twice, if he even stuck to the script."&lt;ref name=marill /&gt; Biographer Alvin Marill states that "at 59, Mickey Rooney was reincarnated as a baggy-pants comedian—back as a top banana in show biz in his belated Broadway debut."&lt;ref name=marill /&gt;

Following this, he toured as Pseudelous in Stephen Sondheim's ''[[A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum]]''.&lt;ref name=Lertzman/&gt;{{rp|351}} In the 1990s, he returned to Broadway for the final months of ''[[Will Rogers Follies]]'', playing the ghost of Will's father.&lt;ref name=Lertzman/&gt;{{rp|547}} On television, he starred in the short-lived sitcom, ''[[One of the Boys (TV series)|One of the Boys]]'',&lt;ref name=Lertzman/&gt;{{rp|539}} along with two unfamiliar young stars, [[Dana Carvey]] and [[Nathan Lane]], in 1982.

He toured Canada in a [[dinner theatre]] production of ''The Mind with the Naughty Man'' in the mid-1990s.&lt;ref name=Lertzman/&gt;{{rp|548}} He played The Wizard in a stage production of ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1987 musical)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' with [[Eartha Kitt]] at [[Madison Square Garden]].&lt;ref name=Lertzman/&gt;{{rp|489}} Kitt was later replaced by [[Jo Anne Worley]].

===Final years===
Rooney wrote a memoir titled ''Life is Too Short'', published by [[Villard Books]] in 1991. A ''[[Library Journal]]'' review said that "From title to the last line, 'I'll have a short bier', Rooney's self-deprecating humor powers this book." He wrote a novel about a child star, published in 1994, ''The Search For Sunny Skies''.&lt;ref name="NPR-AP-4-7-14"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=300098513|title=Iconic Hollywood Actor Mickey Rooney Dies At 93|publisher=NPR|date=April 7, 2014|agency=The Associated Press|accessdate=April 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the millions of dollars that he earned over the years, such as his $65,000 a week earnings from ''Sugar Babies'', Rooney was plagued by financial problems late in life. His longtime gambling habit caused him to "gamble away his fortune again and again." He declared bankruptcy for the second time in 1996 and described himself as "broke" in 2005. He kept performing on stage and in the movies, but his personal property was valued at only $18,000 when he died in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/08/showbiz/mickey-rooney-will/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Rooney and his wife Jan toured the country in 2005 through 2011 in a musical [[revue]] called ''Let's Put on a Show''. ''Vanity Fair'' called it "a homespun affair full of dog-eared jokes" that featured Rooney singing [[George Gershwin]] songs.&lt;ref name="Vanity Fair – April 7, 2014" /&gt;

In 2006, Rooney played Gus in ''[[Night at the Museum]]''.&lt;ref name=USA&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/12/17/mickey-rooney-night-at-the-museum/20522953/ "Mickey Rooney gives one final 'Museum' moment"], ''USA Today'', December 17, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/the-films-of-mickey-rooney/33/ |title=The films of Mickey Rooney "Night at the Museum" |work=[[CBS News Sunday Morning]] |accessdate=June 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to play the role again in the sequel ''[[Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian]]'' in 2009, in a scene that was deleted from the final film.&lt;ref name=USA/&gt;

In 2011, Rooney made a brief cameo appearance in ''[[The Muppets (film)|The Muppets]]'' and in 2014, at age 93, he reprised his role as Gus in ''[[Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb]]'', with the film being dedicated in the honor of Rooney and [[Robin Williams]], who also died that year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://2paragraphs.com/2014/12/night-at-the-museum-mickey-rooneys-highest-paying-job/ "‘Night at the Museum’ Mickey Rooney’s Highest Paying Job"], ''2paragraphs'', December 21, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Although confined to a wheelchair, he was described by director [[Shawn Levy]] as "energetic and so pleased to be there.

An October 2015 article in ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' maintained that Rooney was frequently abused and financially depleted by his closest relatives in the last years of his life. The article said that it was clear that "one of the biggest stars of all time, who remained aloft longer than anyone in Hollywood history, was in the end brought down by those closest to him. He died humiliated and betrayed, nearly broke and often broken."&lt;ref name="THR" /&gt; Rooney suffered from [[bipolar disorder]] and had attempted suicide two or three times over the years, with resulting hospitalizations reported as "nervous breakdowns".&lt;ref name="THR" /&gt;

==Personal life==

At the time of his death, he was married to Jan Chamberlin Rooney, although they had separated in June 2012.&lt;ref name="Jan Rooney Contests"&gt;{{cite news|last=Duke|first=Alan|title=Mickey Rooney's widow contests late actor's will|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2014/05/08/showbiz/mickey-rooney-will|accessdate=January 27, 2015|publisher=CNN|date=May 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had nine children and two stepchildren, as well as 19 grandchildren and several great-grandchildren.&lt;ref name=People-obit&gt;[http://people.com/celebrity/mickey-rooney-dies/ "Mickey Rooney Dies at 93"], ''People'', September 23, 2016 (updated)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;[http://guardianlv.com/2014/04/breaking-news-legendary-actor-mickey-rooney-dead-at-93/ "Legendary Actor Mickey Rooney Dead at 93"], ''Liberty Voice'', April 6, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Rooney had been addicted to sleeping pills; he overcame the sleeping pill addiction in 2000, when he was in his late 70s.&lt;ref name="Vanity Fair – April 7, 2014" /&gt;

[[File:Mickey Rooney (2000).jpg|thumb|left|Rooney and his wife Jan at a military concert in [[Beverly Hills, California]] in 2000]]

On February 16, 2011, Rooney was granted a temporary restraining order against stepson Christopher Aber and Aber's wife, Christina, and they were ordered to stay 100 yards from Rooney, his stepson Mark Rooney and his wife, Charlene Rooney.&lt;ref name=HR&gt;[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/race/mickey-rooneys-final-days-marred-694716 "A Star Is Burned: Mickey Rooney's Final Days Marred by Bizarre Family Feud"], ''The Hollywood Reporter'', April 9, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-12466486|title=Mickey Rooney granted restraining order against stepson|publisher=BBC|date=February 16, 2011|accessdate=January 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rooney claimed that he was a victim of [[elder abuse]].&lt;ref name="Feinberg 4-9-14"&gt;{{cite news|last=Feinberg|first=Scott|title=A Star Is Burned: Mickey Rooney's Final Days Marred by Bizarre Family Feud|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/race/mickey-rooneys-final-days-marred-694716|accessdate=April 9, 2014|newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter|date=April 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 2, 2011, Rooney appeared before a special U.S. Senate committee that was considering legislation to curb elder abuse, testifying about the abuse he claimed to have suffered at the hands of family members.&lt;ref name=HR/&gt; In 2011 all of Rooney's finances were permanently handed over to a conservator,&lt;ref name="BBC-lawyer controls"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-12874412|title=Mickey Rooney lawyer to control finances|publisher=BBC|date=March 27, 2011|accessdate=January 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; who called Rooney "completely competent."&lt;ref name="Feinberg 4-9-14" /&gt;

In April 2011, the temporary restraining order that Rooney was previously granted was replaced by a confidential settlement between Rooney and his stepson, Aber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tmz.com/2011/04/06/mickey-rooney-chris-aber-restraining-order-tro-settlement-stepson-fortune-steal|title=Mickey Rooney drops restraining order against stepson|publisher=Tmz.com|date=February 15, 2011|accessdate=January 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christopher Aber and Jan Rooney denied all the allegations.&lt;ref&gt;Carole Fleck and Talia Schmidt, [http://www.aarp.org/relationships/caregiving/info-03-2011/mickey-rooney-claims-elder-abuse.html "Mickey Rooney Claims Elder Abuse: Actor's testimony to Congress helps spur bill for new crackdown"], AARP Bulletin, March 2, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Silverman|first=Stephen M.|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20470562,00.html|title=Mickey Rooney: 'Elder Abuse Made Me Feel Trapped'|work=People|date=March 3, 2011|accessdate=January 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, Rooney was arrested on suspicion of beating his wife, but charges were dropped due to lack of evidence.&lt;ref name="Rooney arrested 1997"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997-03-12/local/me-37301_1_mickey-rooney|title=Rooney Won't Be Charged With Abuse|work=Los Angeles Times|date=March 12, 1997|accessdate=May 19, 2014|author=Wilson, Tracy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2013, Rooney sold his home of many years, reportedly for $1.3 million, and split the proceeds with his wife, Jan.&lt;ref name="CNN-4-7-14" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hetherman|first=Bill|title=Mickey Rooney's home to be sold for $1.3M to West Hills firm|url=http://www.dailybreeze.com/general-news/20130304/mickey-rooneys-home-to-be-sold-for-13m-to-west-hills-firm|newspaper=Daily Breeze|date=March 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marriages===
Rooney was married eight times, with six of the marriages ending in divorce. In 1942, he married his first wife, actress [[Ava Gardner]], who at that time was still an obscure teenage starlet. They divorced the following year, partly because he had apparently been unfaithful.&lt;ref name="THR" /&gt; While stationed in the military in Alabama in 1944, Rooney met and married [[B. J. Baker|Betty Jane Phillips]], who later became a singer under the name B.J. Baker. They had two sons together. This marriage ended in divorce after he returned from Europe at the end of World War II. His marriage to actress [[Martha Vickers]] in 1949 produced one son but ended in divorce in 1951. He married actress [[Elaine Devry|Elaine Mahnken]] in 1952 and they divorced in 1958.&lt;ref name=People-obit/&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;

In 1958, Rooney married Barbara Ann Thomason, but she was [[Milos Milos#death|murdered by her secret lover in 1966]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/14799211/mickey_rooneys_wifemurder_suicide/|title=Mickey Rooney's Wife Murder-Suicide Victim|date=February 1, 1966|publisher=The Charleston Daily Mail|page=1|accessdate=October 31, 2017|via = [[Newspapers.com]]}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then married Barbara's best friend, Marge Lane. That marriage lasted 100 days. He was married to Carolyn Hockett from 1969 to 1975.&lt;ref name=People-obit/&gt;
In 1978, Rooney married his eighth and final wife, Jan Chamberlin. Their marriage lasted until his death, a total of 34 years (longer than his seven previous unions combined), although they separated in 2012.&lt;ref name="Jan Rooney Contests" /&gt;

===Death===

A group of family members and friends, including [[Mickey Rourke]], held a memorial service on April 18. A private funeral, organized by another set of family members, was held at [[Hollywood Forever Cemetery]], where he was ultimately interred, on April 19.

==Legacy==
Rooney was one of the last surviving actors of the silent picture era. His movie career spanned 88 years, from 1926 to 2014, continuing until shortly before his death. During his peak years from the late 1930s to the early 1940s, Rooney was among the top box-office stars in the United States.&lt;ref name="Mccartney"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mccartney|first=Anthony|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2014/04/07/4043993/legendary-star-mickey-rooney-has.html|title=Los Angeles: Iconic Hollywood actor Mickey Rooney dies at 93|work=Miami Herald|accessdate=April 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He made forty-three pictures between the age of 15 and 25. Among those, his role as [[Andy Hardy]] became one of "Hollywood's best-loved characters," with [[Marlon Brando]] calling him "the best actor in films."&lt;ref name="Monush"&gt;Monush, Barry. ''The Encyclopedia of Hollywood Film Actors'', Applause Theatre and Cinema Books (2003) pp. 648–51&lt;/ref&gt; For his acting the part in fifteen Andy Hardy films, he received an honorary Oscar in 1938 for "bringing to the screen the spirit and personification of youth" and for "setting a high standard of ability and achievement."&lt;ref name=Basinger /&gt;

"There was nothing he couldn't do", said actress [[Margaret O'Brien]].&lt;ref name=Mccartney /&gt; MGM boss [[Louis B. Mayer]] treated him like a son and saw in Rooney "the embodiment of the amiable American boy who stands for family, humbug, and sentiment," writes critic and author, [[David Thomson (film critic)|David Thomson]].&lt;ref name="Thomson"&gt;Thomson, David. ''The New Biographical Dictionary of Film'', Alfred A. Knopf (2002) pp. 754–755&lt;!--ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time Rooney was 20, his consistent portrayals of characters with youth and energy suggested that his future success was unlimited. Thomson also explains that Rooney's characters were able to cover a wide range of emotional types, and gives three examples where "Rooney is not just an actor of genius, but an artist able to maintain a stylized commentary on the demon impulse of the small, belligerent man:"&lt;ref name=Thomson /&gt;

{{quote|Rooney's Puck in [[A Midsummer Night's Dream (1935 film)|''A Midsummer Night's Dream'']] (1935) is truly inhuman, one of cinema's most arresting pieces of magic.&amp;nbsp;... His toughie in [[Boys Town (1938 film)|''Boys Town'']] (1938) struts and bullies like something out of a nightmare and then comes clean in a grotesque but utterly frank outburst of sentimentality in which he aspires to the boy community&amp;nbsp;... His role as [[Baby Face Nelson (film)|''Baby Face Nelson'']] (1957), the manic, destructive response of the runt against a pig society.&lt;ref name=Thomson /&gt;}}

By the end of the 1940s, Rooney's movie characters were no longer in demand and his career went downhill. "In 1938," he said, "I starred in eight pictures. In 1948 and 1949 together, I starred in only three."&lt;ref name=Basinger /&gt; However, film historian [[Jeanine Basinger]] notes that although his career "reached the heights and plunged to the depths, Rooney kept on working and growing, the mark of a professional." Some of the films which reinvigorated his popularity, were ''[[Requiem for a Heavyweight]]'' (1962), ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' (1963) and ''[[The Black Stallion (film)|The Black Stallion]]'' (1979). In the early 1980s, he returned to Broadway in [[Sugar Babies (musical)|''Sugar Babies'']], and "found himself once more back on top."&lt;ref name=Basinger /&gt;

Basinger tries to encapsulate Rooney's career:

{{quote|Rooney's abundant talent, like his film image, might seem like a metaphor for America: a seemingly endless supply of natural resources that could never dry up, but which, it turned out, could be ruined by excessive use and abuse, by arrogance or power, and which had to be carefully tended to be returned to full capacity. From child star to character actor, from movie shorts to television specials, and from films to Broadway, Rooney ultimately did prove he could do it all, do it well, and keep on doing it. His is a unique career, both for its versatility and its longevity.&lt;ref name=Basinger&gt;Bassinger, Jeanine; Unterburger, Amy L., ed. ''International Dictionary of Films and Filmmakers: Actors and Actresses'', 3rd ed., St. James Press, (1997) pp. 1053–56.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;}}
