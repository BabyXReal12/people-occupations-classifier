'''Rose Marie''' (born '''Rose Marie Mazzetta''';&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/12/29/574471087/show-business-icon-rose-marie-dies-at-94|title=Show Business Icon Rose Marie Dies At 94|work=NPR.org|access-date=December 30, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; August 15, 1923 – December 28, 2017) was an [[United States|American]] actress, singer, comedian, and [[vaudeville]] performer with a career that ultimately spanned over nine decades &amp;mdash; and included film, radio, records, theater, night clubs and television. As a child performer during the years just after the [[silent film]] era, she had a successful singing career as '''Baby Rose Marie'''.  As an adult, she became one of the first major stars to be known simply by her first names.

Marie was widely known for her role on the [[CBS]] situation comedy ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]'' (1961–1966), as television comedy writer [[The Dick Van Dyke Show#Characters|Sally Rogers]], "who went toe-to-toe in a man’s world."&lt;ref name="hollywoodrep"&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Rose Marie, Wisecracking Star of 'Dick Van Dyke Show,' Dies at 94 | magazine = [[The Hollywood Reporter]] | first1=Mike |last1=Barnes |first2=Duane |last2=Byrge | date = December 28, 2017 | url = https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/rose-marie-dead-dick-van-722076 |issn=0018-3660}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later she portrayed Myrna Gibbons on ''[[The Doris Day Show]]'' and was a 14-year&lt;ref name="hollywoodrep"/&gt; panelist on ''[[The Hollywood Squares]]''.

She is the subject of a 2017 documentary film ''Wait for Your Laugh'' with interviews from co-stars including [[Carl Reiner]], [[Dick Van Dyke]], [[Peter Marshall (entertainer)|Peter Marshall]] and [[Tim Conway]].&lt;ref name="msn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wonderwall.com/news/the-most-famous-women-in-hollywood=-history-youve-prabably-never-heard-of-1923561.article|title=The most famous women in Hollywood history you've probably never heard of|author=Megan Riedlinger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Marie was born '''Rose Marie Mazzetta''' in [[Manhattan]], New York, on August 15, 1923, to [[Italian Americans|Italian-American]] vaudeville actor Frank Mazzetta, who went by the name of Frank Curley, and [[Polish Americans|Polish-American]] Stella Gluszcak.&lt;ref name="nytobit"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/28/obituaries/rose-marie-dead.html|title=Rose Marie, Decades-Spanning Showbiz Veteran, Is Dead at 94|last=Peterson|first=Alison J.|date=December 28, 2017|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of three, she started performing under the name "Baby Rose Marie." At five, she became a [[radio]] star on [[NBC]] and made a series of films.

At her height of fame as a child singer, from late 1929 to 1934, she had her own radio show, made numerous records, and was featured in a number of [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] films and shorts.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} She continued to appear in films through the mid-1930s, making shorts and one feature picture, ''[[International House (1933 film)|International House]]'' (1933), with [[W. C. Fields]] for [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2017/tv/people-news/rose-marie-dead-dies-dick-van-dyke-show-1202649747/|title=Rose Marie, ‘Dick Van Dyke Show’ Star, Dies at 94|last=Dagan|first=Carmel|date=December 29, 2017|work=Variety|access-date=December 29, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As she entered adulthood, Marie turned to nightclub and lounge performances. According to her autobiography, ''Hold the Roses,'' she was assisted in her career by many members of organized crime, including [[Al Capone]] and [[Bugsy Siegel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/11/rose-marie-documentary-dick-van-dyke-carl-reiner|title=After 90 Years in Show Business, Dick Van Dyke Star Rose Marie Is Still Laughing|last=Monahan|first=Patrick|work=HWD|access-date=December 29, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rose Marie secured work at the [[Flamingo Las Vegas|Flamingo Hotel]] in [[Las Vegas]], Nevada, which was built by Siegel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Eisenberg |first=Dennis |title=Meyer Lansky: Mogul of the Mob |publisher=Paddington Press |year=1979 |isbn=978-0448222066}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the Flamingo's organized crime ties, she had to seek permission to perform in other casinos and remained loyal to "the boys" at the Flamingo for the rest of her life.&lt;ref&gt;[[Last words]] posted on her official Twitter account, December 28, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Concurrently with her nightclub work, the young adult Marie continued to work in radio, earning the nickname "Darling of the Airwaves."

==Recordings==
[[File:Rose-Marie-1930.jpg|thumb|Baby Rose Marie, NBC Radio star in 1930]]
In 1929, the 5-year-old singer made a [[Vitaphone]] sound short titled ''Baby Rose Marie the Child Wonder''.&lt;ref name="hollywoodrep" /&gt; Between 1930 and 1938, she made 17 recordings, three of which were not issued. Her first issued record, recorded on March 10, 1932, featured accompaniment by [[Fletcher Henderson]]'s band, one of the leading African American jazz orchestras of the day. Henderson and the band were said to be in the [[RCA Victor]] studios recording the four songs they were intending to produce that day and were asked to accompany Baby Rose Marie, reading from a stock arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;''Hendersonia'', the bio-discography by Walter C. Allen&lt;/ref&gt;

Her recording of "Say That You Were Teasing Me" (backed with "Take a Picture of the Moon", Victor 22960) also featured Henderson's orchestra and was a national hit in 1932. According to [[Joel Whitburn]], Marie was the last surviving entertainer to have charted a hit before [[World War II]].

==Television==
In the 1960–1961 season, Marie co-starred with [[Shirley Bonne]], [[Elaine Stritch]], [[Jack Weston]], [[Raymond Bailey]], and [[Stubby Kaye]] in ''[[My Sister Eileen (TV series)|My Sister Eileen]]''.&lt;ref name="latobit"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-me-rose-marie-snap-20171228-story.html |title=Rose Marie, co-star of 'The Dick Van Dyke Show,' dies at 94 |first=Valerie J. |last=Nelson |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=December 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She played Bertha, a friend of the Sherwood sisters: Ruth, a [[magazine]] writer, played by Stritch, and Eileen, an aspiring actress, Bonne's role.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

After five seasons (1961–1966) as Sally Rogers on ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]'', Marie co-starred in two seasons (1969–1971) of ''[[The Doris Day Show]]'' as Doris Martin's friend and co-worker Myrna Gibbons. She also appeared in two episodes of ''[[The Monkees (TV series)|The Monkees]]'' in the mid-1960s. She later had a semi-regular seat on the original version of ''[[The Hollywood Squares]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/rose-marie-dick-van-dyke-show-actress-comedy-films-wait-for-your-laugh-al-capone-a8149606.html|title=Rose Marie: 'Dick Van Dyke Show' star who counted Al Capone as a fan|date=2018-01-09|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-01-12|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rose Marie performed on three 1966 and 1967 episodes of ''[[The Dean Martin Show]]'' on [[NBC]] and also twice (1964 and 1968) on ''[[The Hollywood Palace]]'' on ABC.

In the mid-1970s, she portrayed, in recurring fashion, Hilda, who brought fresh doughnuts, made coffee for the team, and provided some comic relief on the police drama ''[[S.W.A.T. (1975 TV series)|S.W.A.T.]].''&lt;ref name="hollywoodrep"/&gt;

In the early 1990s, she had a recurring role as Frank Fontana's mother on ''[[Murphy Brown]]''. She appeared as Roy Biggins' domineering mother Eleanor "Bluto" Biggins in an episode of ''[[Wings (1990 TV series)|Wings]]''. Marie and [[Morey Amsterdam]] appeared together in an October 1993 episode of ''[[Herman's Head]]'' and guest-starred in a February 1996 episode of ''[[Caroline in the City]]'', shortly before Amsterdam's death in October of that same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=HoldTheRoses|title=Rose Marie &amp; Morey Amsterdam {{!}} Caroline and The Watch|date=2012-11-11|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMNHiXrGqDk|accessdate=2018-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theater==
Marie appeared opposite Phil Silvers in ''[[Top Banana (musical)|Top Banana]]'' in 1951, also appearing in the [[Top Banana (film)|1954 film adaptation]]. Her musical numbers were cut from the film in retaliation for her publicly refusing the producers' sexual advances; near the end of her life, she testified that it was the only time she had ever experienced sexual harassment in the entertainment industry in her 90-year career.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/dick-van-dyke-star-rose-marie-what-happened-i-publicly-shamed-my-harasser-guest-column-1063597 What happened when I publicly shamed my harasser]. ''The Hollywood Reporter''. Retrieved December 29, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, she appeared in the [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]] production of ''[[Bye Bye Birdie]]'' as Mae Peterson, the mother of the character played by Dick Van Dyke on Broadway and in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/48076530/ |title=Birdie Opens 2-Week Dallas Run Monday|accessdate=22 June 2018 |work=Waco Tribune-Herald |date=June 20, 1965 |page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1977 to 1985, Marie co-starred with [[Rosemary Clooney]], [[Helen O'Connell]], and [[Margaret Whiting]] in the musical revue ''4 Girls 4'', which toured the United States and appeared on television several times.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.missrosemarie.com/4girls4.htm "Rose Marie and the '4 Girls 4'"], missrosemarie.com; accessed October 25, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

She was the celebrity guest host of a comedy play, ''Grandmas Rock!'', written by Gordon Durich.  It was originally broadcast on radio in 2010 on [[KVTA]] and [[KKZZ]], and rebroadcast on KVTA and KKZZ again in September 2012 in honor of National Grandparents Day.  A CD of the show was also produced, featuring audio clips from ''The Dick Van Dyke Show''.

Marie was married to trumpeter Bobby Guy from 1946 until his death in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bacon |first=James |author-link=James Bacon (author) |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=bJEUAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=NAUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3218,3273453&amp;dq=rose-marie+bobby-guy&amp;hl=en |title=Rose Marie Takes Role on Stage, Nixes Clubs |newspaper=[[Star-Banner]] (Ocala, Florida) |date=June 11, 1965 |page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had one daughter, Georgiana.&lt;ref name="nytobit"/&gt; Around 1972, Marie began a platonic social life with [[Pussycat Theater|Vince Miranda]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sandiegoreader.com/weblogs/bands/2010/jun/29/pussycat-theaters-a-comprehensive-history-of-a-cal/&lt;/ref&gt;

She was active on social media, particularly developing a following on Twitter, where she offered support for women who like her had suffered from [[Weinstein effect|sexual harassment]].&lt;ref name="Following on Twitter"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.etonline.com/dick-van-dyke-star-rose-marie-dead-94-93294 |title=Dick Van Dyke' Star Rose Marie Dead at 94 |last=Donahu |first=Ann |date=December 29, 2017 |website=ETOnline |access-date=December 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her contemporaries and modern performers offered their remembrances and condolences on the same platform; [[Nell Scovell]] called her "the patron saint of female comedy writers.&lt;ref name="Twitter Usage and Memorials"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-42511003 |title=Rose Marie: Dick Van Dyke Show star dies at 94 |date=December 29, 2017 |website=BBC |access-date=December 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
