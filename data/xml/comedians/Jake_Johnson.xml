==Career==

He graduated from [[New Trier High School]] in [[Winnetka, Illinois|Winnetka]] and started his post-secondary education at the [[University of Iowa]].

The [[New York City]] off-Broadway group, ''The Ensemble Studio Theater'', produced his play ''Cousins''.

In 2007, he landed a more regular gig with the [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] mini-show ''[[Derek &amp; Simon|Derek and Simon: The Show]]'', produced by [[Bob Odenkirk]]. {{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

In 2009, he appeared in the [[mockumentary]] ''[[Paper Heart]]''. In 2010, Johnson was cast in a small role in the [[Russell Brand]] comedy, ''[[Get Him to the Greek]]''. He played [[Uma Thurman]]'s character's brother in the romantic comedy ''[[Ceremony (film)|Ceremony]]'', and as a buddy of [[Ashton Kutcher]]'s character in ''[[No Strings Attached (film)|No Strings Attached]]''. In 2011, he played [[Jesus]] in ''[[A Very Harold &amp; Kumar 3D Christmas]]''. In 2012, he appeared in the film version of ''[[21 Jump Street (film)|21 Jump Street]]'', which starred [[Jonah Hill]] and [[Channing Tatum]]. Johnson made an appearance at the 2012 [[Sundance Festival]] as one of the leads in ''[[Safety Not Guaranteed]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://movies.yahoo.com/person/jake-m-johnson/biography.html;_ylt=AqEbRNt7LFbYtc7BmEXgxjn3TssF;_ylu=X3oDMTI2ajBnaDlrBG1pdANQZXJzb24gRW50aXR5IEFib3V0BHBvcwMxBHNlYwNNZWRpYUVudGl0eUFib3V0TGlua3NQYWNrYWdlQXNzZW1ibHk-;_ylg=X3oDMTFqZXE2MWM0BGludGwDdXMEbGFuZwNlbi11cwRwc3RhaWQDBHBzdGNhdAMEcHQDBHRlc3QDdGVzdF9pYg--;_ylv=3 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=January 14, 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106044629/http://movies.yahoo.com/person/jake-m-johnson/biography.html |archivedate=January 6, 2014 |df=mdy-all }} &lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2011, Johnson has been starring as Nick Miller alongside [[Zooey Deschanel]] on ''[[New Girl]]''. In 2013, he appeared in the music video for "Rouse Yourself", a song by indie-soul band [[JC Brooks &amp; the Uptown Sound]] alongside his ''Safety Not Guaranteed'' co-star [[Aubrey Plaza]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ew.com/article/2013/06/19/aubrey-plaza-jake-johnson-video-jc-brooks/|title=Watch Aubrey Plaza and Jake Johnson in JC Brooks &amp; the Uptown Sound's 'Rouse Yourself' video - EXCLUSIVE|work=EW.com|access-date=February 1, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also starring (as a fictional version of himself) in a series of [[Dodge Dart (PF)|Dodge Dart]] commercials with [[Craig Robinson (actor)|Craig Robinson]].

===''Drunk History''===
The [[web series]] ''Drunk History'', which led to the 2013 TV series ''[[Drunk History]]'', was inspired by a 2007 conversation that Johnson had with series creator [[Derek Waters]]. Johnson, while drunk, was trying to describe the story of [[Otis Redding]]'s death to Waters, and Waters was inspired to build a series around history narrated by drunk people. Johnson later appeared in the first episode of the web series (as [[Aaron Burr]]), as well as episode 8 of the TV series' first season (as [[William B. Travis]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2013/07/interview-drunk-history-creator-derek-waters-director-jeremy-konner |title="Drunk History" Creator Derek Waters &amp; Director Jeremy Konner Interview |publisher=Complex |date=July 8, 2013 |accessdate=May 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and episode 9 of the series' third season (as [[Boris Spassky]]).
