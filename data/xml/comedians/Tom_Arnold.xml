==Career==
{{BLP sources section|date=March 2016}}
In the early 1980s, Arnold had a prop-based comedy routine called "Tom Arnold and the Goldfish Review."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gLrXMmu9mRUC&amp;pg=PA193 I Killed: True Stories of the Road from America's Top Comics By Ritch Shydner, Mark Schiff]; accessed March 5, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roseanne Barr]] brought him in as a writer for her television [[Situation comedy|sitcom]], ''[[Roseanne]]''. He married her in 1990, after she divorced her first husband. Arnold wrote himself into the show as the character "Arnie Thomas" (a play on his name){{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}. The couple's marriage attracted media and especially [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] attention due to their sometimes outrageous behavior. In 1992, Arnold starred in his own sitcom, ''[[The Jackie Thomas Show]]''. Airing after ''[[Roseanne]]'' on ABC, the show lasted only 18 episodes.

In 1993, Arnold and Barr bought a house together in Arnold's hometown of [[Eldon, Iowa]] and opened a restaurant, 'Roseanne and Tom's Big Food Diner' nearby.  (The diner served [[Tavern sandwich|loosemeat]] sandwiches similar to the specialty of the fictional Lanford Lunch Box on ''Roseanne'', which in turn was based on the real-life [[Canteen Lunch in the Alley]] in Ottumwa.)  Both appeared in the 1993 movie ''[[The Woman Who Loved Elvis]]'', filmed in Ottumwa.&lt;ref name="Filming"&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108587|title=''The Woman Who Loved Elvis'' details|accessdate=November 27, 2015|publisher=imdb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Arnold and Barr divorced in 1994, and their restaurant closed in 1995.

In Nov. 2000, Arnold played a role on ''[[Baywatch Hawaii]]'' Season 2 in episode 8 (The Cage).

In a late-1990s interview on radio's ''[[The Howard Stern Show|Howard Stern Show]]'', Arnold admitted that his share of his and Barr's estate amounted to "over $20,000,000", including a percentage of the ''[[Roseanne]]'' ABC-TV series, but would not elaborate, citing a confidentiality clause.  In 1994, Arnold appeared as the [[sidekick]] to [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]'s character in the [[James Cameron]] feature film ''[[True Lies]]''.  From 2001 through 2005, he was one of the hosts of ''[[The Best Damn Sports Show Period]]''. He provided the voice for the [[Arby's]] "Oven Mitt" character in television [[Television commercial|commercials]] for the fast-food chain.{{When|date=March 2016}}

Arnold had his first romantic leading man part in the 2005 movie ''[[Happy Endings (film)|Happy Endings]]''.  That same year, Arnold starred in ''[[The Kid &amp; I]]''.  From 2008–11, he hosted the CMT show ''[[My Big Redneck Wedding]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmt.com/shows/dyn/my-big-redneck-wedding/series_about.jhtml My Big Redneck Wedding: About the Show], CMT.com; retrieved August 31, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  He hosted CMT's ''The Biggest Redneck Wedding Ever'' in 2008, in which he served as the wedding planner, created a wedding that exceeded the dreams of a couple who wanted to be married in a mud bog, and performed the actual ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmt.com/shows/dyn/cmts_biggest_redneck_wedding_ever/series_about_special.jhtml CMT's Biggest Redneck Wedding Ever: About the Special], CMT.com; retrieved August 31, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
CMT also made three series of "My Big Redneck Vacation" presented by Arnold and featuring the Clampet Family from Shreveport Louisiana.

Arnold's role as a child molester in ''[[Gardens of the Night]]'' sparked revelations that he had been a victim of sexual abuse in his childhood.  He decided to take on the role to shed more light on the issue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvguide.com/News/Tom-Arnold-Says-35405.aspx "Tom Arnold Says He Was Sexually Abused"], ''[[TV Guide]]''. November 6, 2008; retrieved November 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017, Tom Arnold was revealed as a celebrity contestant on the Australian edition of ''[[I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! (Australia season 3)|I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out Of Here!]]''.
He was the first evictee from the jungle, after 17 days, and stated he was paid between $US600,000 and $US700.000 for his participation in the program.&lt;ref name="dailymail"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tom Arnold paid $900,000 for I'm A Celebrity|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-4251528/tom-arnold-paid-600-000-700-00-m-Celebrity.html|website=Daily Mail|date=22 February 2017}}{{better source needed|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In June 2017, Arnold filed a lawsuit against companies [[Network Ten]] and 'A List Entertainment' for defrauding him for being on ''I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!''.  Arnold claims that he was promised a payment of $425,000 and a comedy tour in Australia.  However, he was missing $140,000 in payment and Network Ten backed out of the comedy tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/tom-arnold-sues-australian-reality-tv-network-fraud-1013838|title=Tom Arnold Sues Australian Reality TV Network for Fraud|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|first=Ashley|last=Cullins|date=2017-06-15|accessdate=2017-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
[[File:TomArnold1SecondFilm.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Arnold in 2004 producing ''[[The 1 Second Film]]'']]
Arnold met comedienne [[Roseanne Barr]] when she saw his act in 1983. Their relationship was complicated by his [[alcoholism]] and [[Addiction|drug addiction]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tom Arnold profile|url=http://www.biography.com/articles/Tom-Arnold-224913|publisher=Biography.com|access-date=September 21, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091005003320/http://www.biography.com/articles/Tom-Arnold-224913|archivedate=October 5, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but eventually he became sober. The two married in 1990 and divorced in 1994. In an April 2009 interview on ''[[Anytime with Bob Kushell]]'', Arnold discussed why when he divorced Barr, he did not take any alimony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Anytime with Bob Kushell feat. Tom Arnold|series=Anytime with Bob Kushell|airdate=April 28, 2009|season=2|number=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the next ten years, Arnold married two subsequent times. Both marriages ended in divorce. In August 2008, Arnold broke his [[scapula]] in a motorcycle accident on the [[California State Route 1|Pacific Coast Highway]].&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Drew Live, September 4, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over Thanksgiving weekend 2009, Arnold married his fourth wife, Ashley Groussman, in Maui before 75 guests. [[Dax Shepard]] served as Arnold's best man.&lt;ref name="wed"&gt;{{cite news|title=Tom Arnold and Ashley Groussman wed in intimate Hawaiian ceremony|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/tom-arnold-ashley-groussman-wed-intimate-hawaiian-ceremony-article-1.414078|author=Cristina Everett|publisher=[[New York Daily News]]|date=November 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He appeared December 10, 2009 on the late night talk show ''Asia Uncut''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Joyce Eng|title=Tom Arnold Marries for Fourth Time|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Tom-Arnold-Marries-1012625.aspx|work=TVGuide.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple have two children and four dogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tom Arnold Welcomes Son Jax Copeland|url=http://celebritybabies.people.com/2013/04/06/tom-arnold-welcomes-son-jax-copeland/#more-183906|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]|date=April 6, 2013|access-date=April 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Murphy|first1=Desiree|title=Tom Arnold and Wife Welcome a Baby Girl -- Find Out Her Adorable Name!|url=https://www.yahoo.com/celebrity/tom-arnold-wife-welcome-baby-001600887.html|website=yahoo.com|date=December 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
