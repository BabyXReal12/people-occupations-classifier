'''Sean Hughes''' (10 November 1965 – 16 October 2017) was an English-born Irish [[stand-up comedian]], [[writer]] and [[actor]]. He starred in his own [[Channel 4]] television show ''[[Sean's Show]]'' and was one of the regular team captains on the [[BBC Two]] musical panel game ''[[Never Mind the Buzzcocks]]''.

==Early life==
Hughes was born in [[Archway, London]], but spent most of his youth in [[Firhouse]], [[Dublin]]. His mother, who was from [[Cork (city)|Cork]] met his father, who was from Dublin, on a London bus. His mother intended to train as a nurse but the plan never materialised. His father worked in a [[telephone exchange]] and was also a [[driving instructor]]. At the age of six Hughes moved to Dublin and lived with his paternal grandmother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/apr/24/sean-hughes-my-family-values|title=Sean Hughes: My family values|first=Interview by Nikki|last=Spencer|date=24 April 2015|publisher=|accessdate=16 October 2017|via=www.theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He attended [[Coláiste Éanna]] in [[Ballyroan, Dublin|Ballyroan]].

Writing in ''[[The Guardian]]'', [[Bruce Dessau]] noted of Hughes's early years that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[He] used to talk about how sounding like a [[Cockney]] in an Irish school was not easy. He later quipped that he spent "most of my childhood in a headlock". Not surprisingly his [[Mary Poppins]] accent soon developed a lilting local burr. Making schoolfriends laugh was a classic defence mechanism and he even set up comedy gigs at his school. What started out as a hobby quickly became a career.&lt;ref name="Guardian obituary"&gt;{{cite news |last= Dessau |first= Bruce | authorlink= Bruce Dessau |title= Sean Hughes obituary |url= https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/oct/16/sean-hughes-obituary| date= 16 October 2017 |newspaper= [[The Guardian]] |location=London| accessdate=16 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Career==
In 1987 he began appearing at the [[The Comedy Store, London|Comedy Store]]. In 1990, aged 24, he became the youngest winner of the prestigious [[Perrier Comedy Award]] for his show, ''A One-Night Stand with Sean Hughes''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comedyawards.co.uk/best-comedy-show/1990/sean-hughes|website=lastminute.com|title=sean hughes - a one night stand|accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He marked his 30th birthday with the ''Sean Hughes Is Thirty Somehow'' tour, which was broadcast on [[Channel 4]], in 1995. Hughes returned to stand-up, touring the UK and Australia in 2007 with his show, ''The Right Side of Wrong''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mick Perrin for Just for Laughs Live in Association with PBJ Management and Gilded Balloon Productions presents Sean Hughes: The Right Side of Wrong|url=http://www.gildedballoon.co.uk/2007/press_releases/Sean_Hughes_~The_Right_Side_of_Wrong~.pdf|publisher=Gilded Balloon Teviot|accessdate=9 August 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529124109/http://www.gildedballoon.co.uk/2007/press_releases/Sean_Hughes_~The_Right_Side_of_Wrong~.pdf|archivedate=29 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as comedy, he wrote collections of prose and poetry and worked on a number of films. He also presented weekend radio shows on the BBC's London radio station [[BBC GLR]], and in 2002 joined [[BBC Radio 6 Music|BBC 6 Music]], presenting the Sunday morning programme. He left the station a year after its launch, proclaiming it had turned into everything he had wanted it to be. He also wrote two novels, ''The Detainees'' (1998) and ''It's What He Would Have Wanted'' (2000).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sean's novel take on life|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/453686.stm|website=BBC News|accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was reported that Hughes was a close friend of the late American comedian [[Bill Hicks]], but Hughes stated this was not true. In a 2014 interview, he explained, "It says on my Wikipedia page that I was good friends with him. I wasn't! We were in Australia together, so we hung out. I did get to know him a little bit, which was a real pleasure. When I saw him I just went, 'That's the best comic I'm going to see in my lifetime.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Stand-up countdown Sean Hughes|first=Ben|last=Williams|work=Time Out|date=25 March 2014|quote=It says on my Wikipedia page that I was good friends with him. I wasn't! We were in Australia together, so we hung out. I did get to know him a little bit, which was a real pleasure. When I saw him I just went, "That's the best comic I'm going to see in my lifetime."|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Nevertheless, Hughes wrote the foreword to [[Cynthia True]]'s biography of Hicks, ''American Scream. The Bill Hicks Story''. He concluded his foreword by writing "being a genius is a heavy burden and he's the only one I'm ever likely to meet. I still miss you Bill."&lt;ref&gt;[http://dir.salon.com/story/people/feature/2002/03/13/hicks/index3.html "American Scream: The Bill Hicks Story"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080503192601/http://dir.salon.com/story/people/feature/2002/03/13/hicks/index3.html|date=3 May 2008}}, salon.com; retrieved 29 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film and television drama==
Hughes had a small role in the film ''[[The Commitments (film)|The Commitments]]'' (1991), playing a record producer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bbfc.co.uk/releases/commitments-1991|title=THE COMMITMENTS {{!}} British Board of Film Classification|last=|first=|date=17 March 2016|website=bbfc.co.uk|access-date=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/movies/the-commitments/cast/128735/|title=The Commitments Cast and Crew|website=TVGuide.com|access-date=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1992, he had his own TV show, ''[[Sean's Show]]'', ostensibly set in his own home. It received a nomination for the 1992 British Comedy Award for Best Channel 4 Sitcom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/seans-show/|title=Sean's Show|last=TV.com|website=TV.com|access-date=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/blogs/poplife/2013/01/25/sean-hughes-once-i-embraced-my-gene-pool-i-found-life-much-more-bearable/|title=Sean Hughes: ‘Once I embraced my gene pool I found life much more bearable’ {{!}} Pop Life|last=Mullally|first=Una|date=25 January 2013|website=www.irishtimes.com|language=en|access-date=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Series one of ''Sean's Show'' has been released on DVD.

From 1996 to 2002, he was a team captain on the [[BBC 2]] comedy quiz show ''[[Never Mind the Buzzcocks]]'', alongside [[Phill Jupitus]] and [[Mark Lamarr]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sean Hughes quits Buzzcocks|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/2166693.stm|website=BBC News|accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He can be seen during [[Terrorvision]]'s music video for their single "Tequila" from 1999 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZC4aC8LLsvw&amp;feature=channel_video_title|title=Never Mind the Buzzcocks episode showing Sean in Terrorvision video|accessdate=11 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the video for [[The Cure]]'s 1996 single, "[[The 13th]]".&lt;ref name="Cure13"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.musicfanclubs.org/cure/press/I53.html|title=Making Wild Mood Swings pay off|publisher=Music Fan Club|date=22 April 1996|accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He appeared in the 2010 [[Edinburgh Fringe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-11053202|title=BBC News - Fringe's funniest joke prize awarded to Tim Vine|publisher=bbc.co.uk|date=23 August 2010|accessdate=21 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
