'''Frederick Allan''' "'''Rick'''" '''Moranis''' (born April 18, 1953) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] actor, comedian, screenwriter, producer, musician, and songwriter. He is currently on film acting hiatus. He came to prominence in the sketch comedy series ''[[Second City Television]]'' (''SCTV'') in the 1980s and later appeared in several [[Hollywood]] films, including ''[[Strange Brew]]'' (1983), ''[[Ghostbusters]]'' (1984),'' [[Little Shop of Horrors (film)|Little Shop of Horrors]]'' (1986), ''[[Spaceballs]]'' (1987), ''[[Honey, I Shrunk the Kids]]'' (1989, and its [[Honey, I Blew Up the Kid|1992]] and [[Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves|1997]] sequels), ''[[Parenthood (1989 film)|Parenthood]]'' (1989), ''[[My Blue Heaven (1990 film)|My Blue Heaven]]'' (1990), and ''[[The Flintstones (film)|The Flintstones]]'' (1994).

In 1997, Moranis began a long hiatus from acting to dedicate his time to his 2 children as a widowed father.&lt;ref name=HollywoodReporter&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/rick-moranis-reveals-why-he-829779|title=Rick Moranis Is Not Retired|last=Parker | first=Ryan|magazine=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=October 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has not appeared in a live-action film since, although he has provided voice-over work for a few animated films, notably [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney's]] ''[[Brother Bear]]'' (2003). He has also released comedy albums and made appearances at fan conventions.

==Early life==
Moranis was born in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], to a [[Jews|Jewish]] family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jns.org/latest-articles/2013/6/24/rick-moranis-going-from-ghostbusters-to-moms-brisket-draws-on-jewish-roots-in-new-album|title=Rick Moranis, going from ‘Ghostbusters’ to mom’s brisket, draws on Jewish roots in new album|work=JNS.org|accessdate=October 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went to [[elementary school]] with [[Geddy Lee]], frontman of the [[rock band]] [[Rush (band)|Rush]].&lt;ref name="Yuddybio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yuddy.com/celebrity/rick-moranis/bio|title=Rick Moranis|work=Yuddy.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090402020713/http://www.yuddy.com/celebrity/rick-moranis/bio|archivedate=April 2, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
His career as an entertainer began as a radio [[disc jockey]] in the mid-1970s, using the on-air name "Rick Allan" at three Toronto radio stations.&lt;ref name="Yuddybio" /&gt;

In 1977 he teamed up with Winnipeg-born writer/director and performer [[Ken Finkleman]] on a series of live performances on [[CBC Television|CBC]]'s ''[[90 Minutes Live]]''; comedy radio specials; and television comedy pilots, including one called ''Midweek'' and another called ''1980'' (produced at [[CBLA-FM|CBC Toronto]] in 1979). Both pilots starred Finkleman and Moranis in a series of irreverent sketches including an early mockumentary sketch featuring Moranis as a Canadian movie producer, and another featuring the dubbed-in voiceovers of Nazi war criminals as they appear to be discussing their Hollywood agents and the money one can earn being interviewed on major documentary series like ''[[The World at War|The World At War.]]''

In 1980, Moranis was persuaded to join the third-season cast of ''[[Second City Television]]'' (SCTV) by friend and SCTV writer/performer [[Dave Thomas (actor)|Dave Thomas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sctvguide.ca/characters/#moranis|title=SCTV Guide - People - Cast|work=sctvguide.ca|accessdate=October 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Moranis was the only cast member not to have come from a [[The Second City|Second City]] stage troupe. He is known for such impressions as [[Woody Allen]], [[Merv Griffin]] and [[David Brinkley]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

With SCTV moving to CBC in 1980 (and syndicated to the United States), Moranis and Thomas were challenged to fill two additional minutes with "identifiable Canadian content," and created a sketch called [[List of Bob &amp; Doug McKenzie appearances on SCTV|''The Great White North'']] featuring the characters [[Bob and Doug McKenzie]], a couple of Canadian buffoons. By the time NBC ordered 90-minute programs for the U.S. in 1981 (the fourth season of SCTV overall), there had been such favorable feedback from affiliates on the McKenzies that the network requested the duo have a sketch in every show.&lt;ref&gt;Plume, Kenneth. "Interview with [[Dave Thomas (actor)|Dave Thomas]] (Part 1 of 5)" at movies.img.com, February 10, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bob and Doug became a pop-culture phenomenon, which led to a top-selling and Grammy nominated album, ''[[The Great White North (album)|Great White North]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hanna | first=Erin|title=Second City or Second Country?|work=cineaction.ca|date=2009|url=http://cineaction.ca/issue78sample.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1983 movie ''[[Strange Brew]]'', Moranis' first major film role.

Another notable Moranis character on ''SCTV'' was Gerry Todd, a disc jockey who presented music clips on television. The sketch aired before the debut of [[MTV]] in the United States, leading both [[Sound &amp; Vision (magazine)|Sound &amp; Vision]] and [[Martin Short]] to dub Moranis as the creator of the [[video jockey]]. "There had been no such thing" up until that point, recalled Short, so "the joke was that there would be such a thing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mettler | first=Mike|title=An Hour with /SCTV/'s Rick Moranis|work=Sound &amp; Vision|date=August 2, 2004|url=https://www.soundandvision.com/content/hour-sctvs-rick-moranis}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ryan | first=Mike|title=Martin Short On The Differences Between ‘SNL’ &amp; ‘SCTV’|work=Huffington Post|date=June 7, 2012|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/07/martin-short-sctv-snl_n_1577805.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feature films===
[[File:Rick Moranis handprints.jpg|thumb|The handprints of Rick Moranis in front of [[The Great Movie Ride]] at [[Walt Disney World]]'s theme park, [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]]]]
After his ''SCTV'' work and the ''Strange Brew'' movie, Moranis had a busy career in feature films that lasted over a decade, most notably ''[[Ghostbusters]]''; ''[[Spaceballs]]''; ''[[Little Shop of Horrors (film)|Little Shop of Horrors]]''; and ''[[Honey, I Shrunk the Kids]]'' and its sequels. He also did the voice-over for a short-lived [[cartoon]] [[Television program|series]] on [[NBC]] called ''[[Gravedale High]]'' (1990).

In a 2004 interview, Moranis talked about his favorite kinds of films:
{{quote|On the last couple of movies I made—big-budget Hollywood movies—I really missed being able to create my own material. In the early movies I did, I was brought in to basically rewrite my stuff, whether it was ''Ghostbusters'' or ''Spaceballs''. By the time I got to the point where I was "starring" in movies, and I had executives telling me what lines to say, that wasn't for me. I’m really not an actor. I'm a guy who comes out of comedy, and my impetus was always to rewrite the line to make it funnier, not to try to make somebody’s precious words work.&lt;ref name=sound /&gt;}}

Moranis' last film roles were [[Barney Rubble]] in [[The Flintstones (film)|''The Flintstones'']] (1994) and the box-office flop ''[[Big Bully (film)|Big Bully]]'' (1996). Other than the [[Honey, I Shrunk the Kids (franchise)|''Honey, I Shrunk the Kids'']] sequels, by the mid-1990s his only appearance in that genre was a 1993 music video, [[Kamakiriad|"Tomorrow's Girls"]] by [[Donald Fagen]], in which he played a man married to an extraterrestrial woman. Disney's final film in the ''Honey, I Shrunk the Kids'' franchise is 1997's direct-to-video film ''[[Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves]]'', in which Moranis is the final remaining original cast member. The series ''[[Honey, I Shrunk the Kids: The TV Show]]'' also launched in 1997 but without Moranis, then concluding in 2000. He worked for Disney twice more (with his fellow ''[[Second City Television|SCTV]]'' alumnus [[Dave Thomas (actor)|Dave Thomas]]), voicing Rutt the moose in the 2003 animated film ''[[Brother Bear]]'' and its [[Brother Bear 2|direct-to-video sequel]].

Moranis was also slated to appear in ''[[The Breakfast Club]]'', but was released by [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]] because his interpretation of the role was not what Hughes was looking for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://splitsider.com/2013/02/the-lost-roles-of-rick-moranis/|title=The Lost Roles of Rick Moranis|work=Splitsider|accessdate=October 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Moranis received his first film credit since 1997 when he provided voice work in the animated film, ''[[Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer and the Island of Misfit Toys]]''. In 2003, he provided his voice to the animated film ''[[Brother Bear]]''.

{{As of|2004}}, Moranis was on the Advisory Committee for the [[Humber College Comedy: Writing and Performance|comedy program]] at [[Humber College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Peterson|first=Dean|title=HEY, WHATEVER HAPPENED TO RICK MORANIS?|url=http://www.mydamnchannel.com/post/hey__whatever_happened_to_rick_moranis__6586.aspx|work=mydamnchannel.com|accessdate=July 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Moranis released an [[album]] titled ''The Agoraphobic Cowboy'', featuring [[Country music|country]] songs with [[lyrics]] which Moranis says follow in the comic [[tradition]] of [[songwriters]]/[[singers]] such as [[Roger Miller]], [[Kinky Friedman]], and [[Jim Stafford]]. The album was produced by [[Tony Scherr]] and is distributed through [[ArtistShare]], as well as Moranis's official web site. Commenting on the origins of the songs, he said that in 2003, "Out of the blue, I just wrote a bunch of songs. For lack of a better explanation, they’re more country than anything. And I actually demoed four or five of them, and I'm not sure at this point what I’m going to do with them—whether I’m going to fold them into a full-length video or a movie. But, boy, I had a good time doing that."&lt;ref name=sound&gt;[http://www.soundandvisionmag.com/article.asp?article_id=650 Mettler, Mike. "An Hour with SCTV's Rick Moranis – Web Exclusive, eh: The popular Canadian comedian welcomes SCTV to DVD"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071122230031/http://www.soundandvisionmag.com/article.asp?article_id=650 |date=November 22, 2007 }}, ''[[Sound and Vision (magazine)|Sound &amp; Vision]]'', August 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 8, 2005, ''The Agoraphobic Cowboy'' was announced as a nominee for the 2006 Grammy for Best Comedy Album. On February 3, 2006, Moranis performed "Press Pound" on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'' and discussed the development of his music career.

In 2006, Moranis reprised his role in the animated film ''[[Brother Bear 2]]''.

In November 2007, Moranis reunited with [[Dave Thomas (actor)|Dave Thomas]] for a 24th anniversary special of Bob and Doug McKenzie, titled ''Bob and Doug McKenzie's 2–4 Anniversary''. The duo shot new footage for this special. Thomas subsequently created a new animated Bob and Doug McKenzie series, ''[[Bob &amp; Doug (2009 TV series)|Bob &amp; Doug]]'', for his company [[Animax Entertainment]]. Moranis declined to voice the role of Bob, which was taken over by [[Dave Coulier]], but remained involved in the series as an executive producer.&lt;ref name=star&gt;Rob Salem, [https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/Television/article/620381 "Bob &amp; Doug taking off again"]. ''[[Toronto Star]]'', April 19, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2013, Moranis announced that he would release a brand new comedy album titled ''My Mother's Brisket &amp; Other Love Songs'', his first album in eight years. The album was released on June 18, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vulture.com/2013/05/rick-moranis-return.html|title=Rick Moranis Is Ready to Return to the World|first=Zach | last=Dionne|work=Vulture|accessdate=October 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moranis said of the release "When I first began writing jokes and sketches with various Jewish partners one of us would inevitably stop at some point and announce, "Too Jewish!" Too Jewish for the star, the show, the network, or the audience. The songs on this album are all in that category. I grew up hearing the [[Allan Sherman]] and the ''You Don't Have To Be Jewish'' albums in the '60s. Now I am in my 60s."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Mothers-Brisket-Other-Love-Songs/dp/B00CPKZLF2/ref=sr_1_1?s=music&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1372227591&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=rick+moranis|title=Rick Moranis - My Mother's Brisket &amp; Other Love Songs - Amazon.com Music|work=amazon.com|accessdate=October 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2013, Moranis gave an interview where he talked about reprising his role as Louis Tully in a third ''Ghostbusters'' film and his disappointment with the sequel. Moranis said "I haven't talked to [[Dan Aykroyd]] about it. Somebody he's associated with called me and I said, 'I wouldn't not do it, but it's got to be good.' You know, I'm not interested in doing anything I've already done, and I thought the second one was a disappointment. But I guess I'm interested in where that guy is now. I sort of see him as being [[Bernie Madoff]]'s cellmate in jail. Both of them being so orderly that they race to get up and make their beds."&lt;ref name="Empire 2013-06-25"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=37916|title=Exclusive: Rick Moranis On Ghostbusters 3|last=Plumb|first=Ali|date=June 25, 2013|work=[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]|access-date=March 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, regarding an offer for a brief appearance in the film, he concluded: "[''Ghostbusters''] didn't appeal to me. ... I wish them well. ... I hope it's terrific. But it just makes no sense to me. Why would I do just one day of shooting on something I did 30 years ago?"&lt;ref name="HollywoodReporter"/&gt;

=== {{anchor|LeavingActing}} Acting hiatus===
In 1997, Moranis took a hiatus from working in the film industry. He later explained: "I'm a single parent and I just found that it was too difficult to manage to raise my kids and to do the traveling involved in making movies. So I took a little bit of a break. And the little bit of a break turned into a longer break, and then I found that I really didn't miss it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2005-10-12-rick-moranis_x.htm|title=Rick Moranis: From 'Spaceballs' to country 'Cowboy'|work=[[USA Today]]|date=October 13, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; After having declined an invitation to do a cameo appearance in 2016's ''Ghostbusters'' [[Ghostbusters (2016 film)|reboot]], Moranis clarified in an interview with ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' that he had not, in fact, retired from film acting due to his hiatus, but instead had become selective about future roles.&lt;ref name="The Hollywood Reporter"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Parker|first1=Ryan|title=Rick Moranis Reveals Why He Turned Down 'Ghostbusters' Reboot: "It Makes No Sense to Me"|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/rick-moranis-reveals-why-he-829779|work=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=24 April 2016|ref=THR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2017, Moranis and [[Dave Thomas (actor)|Dave Thomas]] reprised their Bob &amp; Doug characters at a benefit concert in Toronto. Proceeds from the benefit will go toward caring for Jake Thomas, Dave Thomas' nephew, who suffered a spinal cord injury that has left him paralyzed from the waist down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/rick-moranis-dave-thomas-reunite-as-mckenzie-brothers-1009284|title=Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas to Reunite as McKenzie Brothers |work=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=June 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018, Moranis was announced to return as the character Dark Helmet in an episode of ''[[The Goldbergs (2013 TV series)|The Goldbergs]]'' albeit as a voice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2018/05/07/goldbergs-snags-rick-moranis-reprise-spaceballs-dark-helmet/578401002/|title=Exclusive: 'The Goldbergs' snags Rick Moranis to reprise the Dark Helmet of 'Spaceballs'|website=USA Today|last=Keveney|first=Bill|date=May 7, 2018|accessdate=May 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Also announced in May 2018, Moranis will join the [[Martin Scorsese]]  directed ''Second City TV'' (SCTV) reunion documentary premiering on [[Netflix]] in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/rick-moranis-joins-sctv-reunion-documentary-netflix-1110613&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Moranis married costume designer Ann Belsky in 1986; together they had two children, Rachel and Mitchell. Belsky died of cancer in February 1991. Moranis then slowly left public life to become a full-time single father. &lt;ref name="entertainment.ie" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Hollywood Reporter"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Parker|first1=Ryan|title=Rick Moranis Reveals Why He Turned Down 'Ghostbusters' Reboot: "It Makes No Sense to Me"|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/rick-moranis-reveals-why-he-829779|work=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=24 April 2016|ref=THR}}&lt;/ref&gt;
