==Career==
{{BLP sources section|date=January 2015}}

===''Saturday Night Live''===
In May 2000, Rudolph joined the cast of ''Saturday Night Live'' as a featured player for the final three episodes of the 1999–2000 season, after a stint as a member of [[The Groundlings]] [[improvisational theatre|improv]] troupe, where she met future ''Saturday Night Live'' cast member [[Will Forte]].&lt;ref name=Itzkoff /&gt; Rudolph's musical talents were frequently employed on ''Saturday Night Live''. She sang as [[Beyoncé Knowles]] in the [[Prince (artist)|Prince]] Show'' s''ketches, as the "Space Creature" in the ''Gays in Space'' sketches, except for the one on the season 31 episode hosted by [[Peter Sarsgaard]], because it aired around the time Rudolph was on maternity leave. Friend, Will Forte, substituted for her during that episode. Her ability to change her looks and her command of many accents also led to her playing an unusually wide range of ethnicities on the show, often with only a change of wigs. As "Nuni Shoener," Rudolph, along with [[Fred Armisen]], created a couple from an unspecified Scandinavian country, who have unplaceable accents and bewilderingly foreign manners. Rudolph was also able to play male characters such as [[Scott Joplin]], [[Justin Guarini]], and [[Mario Vazquez]]''.''

Her final episode as a cast member was on November 3, 2007, with host [[Brian Williams]] and musical guest [[Feist (singer)|Feist]], the last episode before the writers' strike. She returned on October 25, 2008, in a featured guest appearance as [[Michelle Obama]] and sang a duet with [[Kenan Thompson]] about [[Amy Poehler]]'s newborn. She then also appeared in the 2008 Christmas episode, where she reprised her role in the sketch Bronx Beat, with Amy Poehler. She also appeared in two sketches in the 2008–09 season finale with [[Will Ferrell]]. She appeared in a [[Weekend Update Thursday]] sketch during the fall 2009–10 season as Oprah Winfrey speaking on behalf of [[Chicago]]'s bid for the [[2016 Olympics]]. She also appeared on the show in May 2010 to perform in skits including "The Manuel Ortiz Show" with [[Betty White]]. She returned to ''Saturday Night Live'' for the season 36 premiere, hosted by Amy Poehler, performing the "Bronx Beat" sketch and that same season for episode 700, hosted by Tina Fey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last =McGlynn|first =Katla |title = 'SNL': Pregnant Tina Fey &amp; Maya Rudolph Sing Duet About Doin' It  | work=[[Huffington Post|www.huffingtonpost.com]] |date = May 8, 2011|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/05/08/snl-pregnant-tina-fey-maya-rudolph-sing-duet_n_859117.html  | accessdate =May 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 18, 2012 she returned to ''Saturday Night Live'' as a host for the first time and reprised her roles in sketches such as "Bronx Beat".
