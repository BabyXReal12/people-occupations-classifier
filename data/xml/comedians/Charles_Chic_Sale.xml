'''Charles Partlow''' "'''Chic'''" '''Sale''' (August 25, 1885 – November 7, 1936) was an [[United States|American]] actor and [[Vaudeville|vaudevillian]]. He was a son of Frank and Lillie Belle (née Partlow) Sale, and the brother of actress/writer [[Virginia Sale|Virginia Sale-Wren]].

==Career==
Sale was born in [[South Dakota]] and raised in [[Urbana, Illinois]]. In 1920, after a tour wherein he played "rural parts," he was engaged by [[Christie Studios]] on [[Gower Street, Hollywood|Gower Street]] in [[Los Angeles]]. According to Grace Kingsley in the Jan. 28 edition of the [[Los Angeles Times]], page II11, "It now comes to light that Chic Sale, appearing at the [[Orpheum Theatre (Los Angeles, California)|Orpheum]] this week, will as soon as his present tour is finished, about the middle of next month, return to town in the Capacity of a Christie star. Mr. Sale's first photoplay will be a five-reeler, adapted from [[Irvin S. Cobb]]'s 'The Smart Aleck,' after which he will be starred in other well-known stories suitable to his talents." The item goes on to mention that [[Charles Christie]], business head of the Christie studio, entered into a contract with [[Exceptional Pictures]] to produce the Sale film, to be distributed through [[Robertson-Cole]], and notes Sale's occasional appearances in the [[Ziegfeld Follies]] and the [[Shubert Organization|Shubert]] [[Winter Garden Theatre|Winter Garden]] shows. The movie was eventually named ''[[His Nibs (film)|His Nibs]]'', and co-starred [[Colleen Moore]]. Chic played many of the parts himself, the film being a spoof of the sort of the "hick", backwater characterizations that were his specialty.

In 1929, inspired by a carpenter named 'Lem Putt' from his hometown of [[Urbana, Illinois|Urbana]], Sale wrote ''The Specialist'', a play about an [[outhouse]] builder.&lt;ref name = "Welsh"&gt;{{cite book |title= This Old Farm | author= Roger Welsh |publisher= Voyageur Press | location= |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=OnaNrR9-YEwC&amp;pg=PA55&amp;dq=chic+sale+the+specialist&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjYut6nmuDRAhWI6yYKHWLqC8kQ6AEIRTAI#v=onepage&amp;q=chic%20sale%20the%20specialist&amp;f=false |date=1999 |pages=51–59 | isbn = 9781610605489 | accessdate = 26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because copyright infringement was widespread in Vaudeville, Sale enlisted the aid of two newspapermen to adapt ''The Specialist'' into a book. This enjoyed great success, and Sale spent the next several months responding to fan mail.

Sale had a career in [[Hollywood]], appearing in various comic roles until his death from pneumonia in 1936. In contrast to his comic roles, one of his loftier appearances came as [[Abraham Lincoln|President Abraham Lincoln]] in 1935. ''[[The Perfect Tribute]]'' was a short film dramatizing Lincoln's disappointment at the meagre reaction to his [[Gettysburg Address]]. He encounters a dying and blind soldier who, not knowing he is addressing the President himself, tells Lincoln how inspiring the speech was.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Although an obscure figure today, Sale was a well-known [[popular culture]] figure during the 1930s, and was often the subject of jokes by comedians like [[Groucho Marx]], usually in reference to ''The Specialist''. Chic is also mentioned as an aside late in the [[Marx Brothers]] film, ''[[Animal Crackers (1930 film)|Animal Crackers]]'', in a conversation between Ravelli ([[Chico Marx]]) and Groucho's character, [[Captain Spaulding (Groucho Marx)|Captain Spaulding]]). For many years—even after his death—"Chic Sale" was used as a [[euphemism]] for an [[outhouse]]. He is known to have found this unflattering, calling it "a terrible thing to have happen".&lt;ref name = "Welsh"/&gt;
