====''Saturday Night Live'' characters====
;''Weekend Update'' characters
* Olya Povlatsky, a Russian woman who voices her opinions on current events, comparing them to the outrageous struggles she faces in her village. She also appeared in a cold open with [[Beck Bennett]] as [[Vladimir Putin]] reading a prepared statement against her will.
* Deenie, a.k.a. "Somebody's Mom", a middle-aged woman who attempts to recap soap operas she's been watching, but only knows the characters by self-applied nicknames, such as "Big Boobs" and "Mustache". She is always eating some foul concoction out of Tupperware, such as Brussels sprouts and imitation crab, which generally both revolts and breaks up anchor [[Colin Jost]].
* Mrs. Santini, an apartment dweller who writes passive-aggressive notes to her neighbors. Originally performed as Effie Villalopolus on ''[[Comedy Bang! Bang! (TV series)|Comedy Bang! Bang!]]''

;Other characters

* Jodi Cork, one of the hosts of Women in the Workplace.
* Barbara DeDrew, a lesbian volunteer at the cat shelter Whiskers R We.
* Helga Handler, a Swedish TV presenter who speaks only in exaggeratedly Swedish-sounding gibberish, occasionally saying crude English words.
* Colleen Rafferty, a middle-aged woman who appears in panels in which other sketch participants (mostly Cecily Strong as a hippie woman named Sharon) recount idyllic paranormal events (such as being abducted by aliens twice, having a near-death experience, and discovering that Santa Claus is real) while Rafferty experiences less enjoyable versions.
* Les Dykawitz, a lesbian cop from the 1970s who works for Chicago PD along with her partner, Chubina Fatzarelli (played by [[Aidy Bryant]]), in "Dyke &amp; Fats".
* Debette Goldry, a senile, septuagenarian actress whose harsh experiences with being an actress in Hollywood (including the on-going issues of equal pay and sexual harassment/abuse) are more outrageous than what modern actresses have gone through.
* A member of Woodbridge High School's theatre troupe, who make their performances obsessively and solely about social justice issues that they know very little about.
* Noelle LeSoup, the co-host of the French show "America's Funniest Cats", who appears on the American version of the show along with Joelle LaRue (played by [[Cecily Strong]]).
* Shud, a crass [[mermaid]] who is based on a [[blobfish]], and makes sexual advances on an unfortunate marooned sailor.

In 2015, McKinnon appeared in a number of commercials for the [[Ford Focus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newnownext.com/kate-mckinnon-is-hilarious-in-the-new-ford-focus-ads/09/2015/|title=Kate McKinnon Is Hilarious In The New Ford Focus Ads|publisher=New Now Next|date=September 27, 2015|accessdate=October 25, 2016|last=Salandra|first=Adam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, McKinnon co-hosted the [[31st Independent Spirit Awards]] with [[Kumail Nanjiani]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/2016-spirit-awards-opening-monologue-870321|title= Spirit Awards: Kumail Nanjiani, Kate McKinnon Parody 'Room,' Mock #OscarsSoWhite in Opening|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= February 27, 2016|website= [[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher= |access-date= February 28, 2016|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McKinnon has made appearances as a voice actress in series like ''[[The Simpsons]]'' (as Hettie in season 27, episode 14 "[[Gal of Constant Sorrow]]") and ''[[Family Guy]]'' (a voice in season 14, episode 15 "[[An App a Day]]", as Karen / Heavy Flo in season 14, episode 6 "[[Peter's Sister]]", and a voice in season 15, episode 9 "[[How the Griffin Stole Christmas]]"), and films such as ''[[Finding Dory]]'' (as Stan's fish wife), ''[[The Angry Birds Movie]]'' (as Stella / Eva the Birthday Mom) and ''[[Ferdinand (film)|Ferdinand]]'' (as Lupe).

She does not use social media, citing fear that she will "misrepresent her true feelings".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amy Schumer, Lena Dunham, Gina Rodriguez and More Actresses on THR's Roundtables|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETKNKbi3KhY&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=23m19s|website=Youtube}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

McKinnon's knack for accents began when she was in 5th grade. She auditioned to be "the queen of reading week" and used a British accent. In an interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', she says, "I think the genesis of my entire life, probably, was the smiles I elicited doing this British accent. I've been chasing that dragon ever since."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/features/how-kate-mckinnon-became-the-snl-weirdo-in-chief-w443058|title=How Kate McKinnon Became the 'SNL' Weirdo-in-Chief|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2017-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to theater, McKinnon is interested in science. She said to ''[[The New York Times]]'', "I've been a big [[astrophysics]] nut since I was 12. I have always had a real soft spot for the bizarreness of [[quantum mechanics]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/04/movies/kate-mckinnon-on-ghostbusters-snl-and-hillary-clinton.html|title=Kate McKinnon on 'Ghostbusters,' 'S.N.L.' and Hillary Clinton|last=Itzkoff|first=Dave|date=2016-08-03|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-10-12|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;
