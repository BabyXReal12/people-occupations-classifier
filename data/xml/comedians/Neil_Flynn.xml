'''Neil Richard Flynn''' (born November 13, 1960) is an American actor, comedian and voice actor. He is perhaps best known for his role as [[Janitor (Scrubs)|Janitor]] in the [[NBC]] series ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]'' (2001–09) as well as [[List of The Middle characters|Mike Heck]] in the [[ABC Studios|ABC]] comedy series ''[[The Middle (TV series)|The Middle]]'' (2009–18).

Flynn has had notable appearances in many prolific television programs in small roles, such as ''[[That '70s Show]]'', ''[[Seinfeld]]'', ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation|CSI]]'' and ''[[Smallville]]'' and the television films ''[[It's a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie]]'' and ''[[Wake Up, Ron Burgundy: The Lost Movie]].''         

His film career includes performances in ''[[The Fugitive (1993 film)|The Fugitive]]'', ''[[Home Alone 3]]'', ''[[Mean Girls]]'', ''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]'' and ''[[The Resurrection of Gavin Stone]]''.

Flynn's credits also extend to voice-acting work with roles in movies including ''[[Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs (film)|Cloudy With a Chance Of Meatballs]]'', prime-time TV shows ''[[King of the Hill]]'' and ''[[Bob's Burgers]]'', the ''[[Ratchet &amp; Clank|Ratchet and Clank]]'' series of games as well as the animated series ''[[Buzz Lightyear of Star Command]]'' and ''[[Clone High]]'' 

In 2015, he joined [[The CW|The CW's]] [[Arrowverse]] with a starring role in the [[DC Comics|DC]] [[Web series|web series]] ''[[Vixen (web series)|Vixen]]'' (2015–present). He is also set to appear alongside [[Natalie Morales (actress)|Natalie Morales]] in the [[NBC]] sitcom ''[[Abby's]]'' in a main role with a projection date of 2019''.''

==Early life==
Flynn was born on the [[South Side, Chicago|south side]] of [[Chicago]]. He is of [[Irish American|Irish]] descent and was raised in a devout [[Roman Catholic]] household.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvsquad.com/2010/05/05/patricia-heaton-on-spending-mothers-day-in-the-middle/|title=Patricia Heaton on Spending Mother's Day in 'The Middle'|publisher=[[Weblogs, Inc.|TV Squad]]|quote = And so many of us -- Neil Flynn grew up in the suburbs of Chicago -- and just talking about how he grew up ... And he's also Irish-Catholic, which is how I grew up.|date=May 5, 2010|accessdate=October 10, 2010|first=Joel|last=Keller}}&lt;/ref&gt; He moved to [[Waukegan, Illinois]], at an early age. As a student at Waukegan East High School in 1978, he and partner Mike Shklair won an [[Illinois]] [[Individual Events]] state championship for "Humorous Duet Acting." He attended [[Bradley University]] in [[Peoria, Illinois]], where he was a member of [[Sigma Nu]] fraternity and participated on the Bradley University Speech Team. {{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} After graduating in 1982, Flynn returned to Chicago to pursue an acting career.

==Career==
In Chicago, he acted with the renowned [[Goodman Theater|Goodman]] and [[Steppenwolf Theatre Company|Steppenwolf]] theaters. Flynn was nominated for a [[Joseph Jefferson Award]] (Actor in a Principal Role, for ''[[The Ballad of the Sad Cafe]]'', 1986). He also performed at the [[IO Theater|Improv Olympic]] and the [[The Second City|Second City Comedy Troupe]]. In 1998, he founded the improv team Beer Shark Mice with [[David Koechner]], which was still active as of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Metz|first1=Nina|title='Middle' and 'Anchorman' stars return to iO Theater with improv team Beer Shark Mice|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/theater/ct-beer-shark-mice-improv-flynn-koechner-20150810-column.html|accessdate=26 April 2018|agency=Chicago Tribune|date=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although his role on ''Scrubs'' had been to that point the most visible, he had other small roles in a variety of different TV shows and movies, including ''[[That '70s Show]]'', ''[[Baby's Day Out]]'', ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation|CSI]]'', ''[[My Boys]]'', ''[[Seinfeld]]'', and ''[[Smallville]]''.

In ''[[The Fugitive (1993 film)|The Fugitive]]'', he plays a [[Chicago]] police officer who is killed by the one-armed man, Frederick Sykes ([[Andreas Katsulas]]) while he is fighting Dr. Richard Kimble ([[Harrison Ford]]), prompting [[Chicago Police Department]] detectives to hunt Ford's character. This role was used in a subplot of the ''Scrubs'' episode "[[My Friend the Doctor]]" when J.D. ([[Zach Braff]]) notices Flynn's character in the film, and believes that Flynn's Janitor character is the actor in the film. In 2008, he worked with Harrison Ford again, playing a suspicious law enforcement official as FBI agent Smith in ''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]''.

Flynn had a minor role in ''[[Mean Girls]]'' as the father of [[Lindsay Lohan]]'s character. He then played the part of an anonymous police officer in ''[[Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy]]''; this scene was cut out of the final version of the film, though it can be viewed in the straight-to-DVD spin-off film ''[[Wake Up, Ron Burgundy: The Lost Movie]]'', and in the deleted scenes of the ''Anchorman'' DVD. He had a minor role in ''[[Major League (film)|Major League]]'' as a [[Stevedore|longshoreman]] and fan of the [[Cleveland Indians]]. Flynn had a role on [[Phil Hendrie]]'s animated pilot that was not picked up by [[Fox Network|FOX]]. He was also the first baseman in the movie ''[[Rookie of the Year (film)|Rookie of the Year]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107985/fullcredits#cast|title=Rookie of the Year at IMDB |publisher=IMDb|accessdate=January 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flynn once appeared in an episode of ''[[The Drew Carey Show]]'', playing the fake husband of future ''Scrubs'' co-star [[Christa Miller]]. He appeared on an episode of ''[[Seinfeld]]'', playing a police officer. 

===''Scrubs''===
For ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]'', Flynn auditioned for the role of Dr. Cox, but was given the role of [[Janitor (Scrubs)|Janitor]], instead. Flynn was originally only cast for the first episode ("[[My First Day]]"), but he became a regular, playing a character known only as the Janitor, who devotes much of his energy to menacing young [[J.D. (Scrubs)|Dr. John "J.D." Dorian]]. His name is not revealed in the series until the season 8 finale when, upon J.D.'s first time asking about it, he simply says his name is Glenn Matthews. This is also speculated to be false for two reasons: first, after J.D. leaves the shot, an orderly addresses the Janitor as "Tommy"; and second, while watching ''The Fugitive'' with Carla and Danni (Dr. Cox's sister-in-law, played by [[Tara Reid]]) in the season 3 episode 'My Friend The Doctor', J.D. notices the real-life Flynn's character in the train scene. When the Janitor confirms he was in the movie at the end of the episode, some speculated the Janitor's real name in ''Scrubs'' is actually Neil Flynn.&lt;ref&gt;[http://starrymag.com/content.asp?ID=2022&amp;CATEGORY=INTERVIEWS Starrymag.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Flynn was a series regular with ''Scrubs'' through the first eight seasons.&lt;ref name="THR--ABC renews Scrubs"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Andreeva|first1=Nellie|title=ABC renews 'Scrubs'|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/abc-renews-scrubs-84082|accessdate=19 July 2015|publisher=Hollywood Reporter|date=15 May 2009|ref=THR--ABC renews Scrubs}}&lt;/ref&gt; When ''Scrubs'' was cancelled by NBC and subsequently picked-up by ABC, he signed a second position one-year deal for ''Scrubs'' season 9, which would have allowed him to continue on ''Scrubs'' if his pilot ''The Middle'' was not picked up.&lt;ref name="THR--ABC renews Scrubs" /&gt; ''The Middle'' was picked up, although he did guest star in the season 9 premiere of ''Scrubs''.

===''The Middle''===
Flynn plays Heck family patriarch Mike Heck on the [[ABC Network Television Group|ABC]] show, ''[[The Middle (TV series)|The Middle]]''.&lt;ref name="THR Middle 100 episodes"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ng|first1=Philiana|title='The Middle': Patricia Heaton, Creators Reflect on Road to 100 Episodes|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/middle-patricia-heaton-creators-reflect-650307|accessdate=19 July 2015|publisher=Hollywood Reporter|date=13 October 2013|ref=THR Middle 100 episodes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the series celebrated 200 episodes. The Middle has been Flynn's main show throughout his television career.

===Voice-over work===
He has also done [[Voice acting|voice acting]] for the animated series ''[[Buzz Lightyear of Star Command]]'', though he is better known for voicing the popular characters Skidd McMarx and the Plumber in the first three ''[[Ratchet &amp; Clank (series)|Ratchet &amp; Clank]]'' games for the [[PlayStation 2]]. He also made a guest appearance in ''[[Kim Possible]]''.

Flynn voiced the character Max Flush on the FOX TV show ''[[Bob's Burgers]]'' in the episode "[[O.T.: The Outside Toilet]]".

As of 2015, he is providing the voice of Chuck, the foster father of the title character in the [[DC Comics]] animated web series ''[[Vixen (web series)|Vixen]]''.
