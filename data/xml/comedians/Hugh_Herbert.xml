'''Hugh Herbert''' (August 10, 1885 &amp;ndash; March 12, 1952)&lt;ref name=lat&gt;[http://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/hugh-herbert/ Hugh Herbert - L.A. Times Hollywood Star Walk]&lt;/ref&gt; was a motion picture comedian. He began his career in [[vaudeville]] and wrote more than 150 plays and sketches.

==Career==
Born in [[Binghamton, New York]], Herbert "had many serious roles, and for years was seen on major vaudeville circuits as a pathetic old Hebrew."&lt;ref name=xdg/&gt;

The advent of talking pictures brought stage-trained actors to Hollywood, and Hugh Herbert soon became a popular movie comedian. His screen character was usually absent-minded and flustered. He would flutter his fingers together and talk to himself, repeating the same phrases: "hoo-hoo-hoo, wonderful, wonderful, hoo hoo hoo!" So many imitators (including [[Curly Howard]] of [[The Three Stooges]] and [[Etta Candy]] in the [[Wonder Woman]] comic book series) copied the catchphrase as "woo woo" that Herbert himself began to use "woo woo" rather than "hoo hoo" in the 1940s.&lt;ref name=xdg/&gt;

Herbert's earliest movies, like [[Wheeler &amp; Woolsey]]'s 1930 feature ''[[Hook, Line and Sinker (1930 film)|Hook, Line and Sinker]]'', cast him in generic comedy roles that could have been taken by any comedian. He developed his own unique screen personality, complete with a silly giggle, and this new character caught on quickly. He was frequently featured in [[Warner Bros.|Warner Brothers]] films of the 1930s, including ''[[Dames]]'', ''[[Footlight Parade]]'', ''[[Bureau of Missing Persons]]'', ''[[Fog Over Frisco]]'', ''[[Fashions of 1934]]'', and ''[[Gold Diggers of 1935]]'', as well as the [[A Midsummer Night's Dream (1935 film)|1935 film adaptation]] of [[Shakespeare]]'s ''A Midsummer Night's Dream''. He played leads in "B comedies", notably ''Sh! The Octopus'', a 1937 comedy-mystery featuring an exceptional unmasking of the culprit.&lt;ref name=xdg/&gt;

He was often caricatured in Warners' [[Looney Tunes]] shorts of the 1930s/40s, such as ''The Hardship of Miles Standish'' and ''Speaking of the Weather''. One of the minor characters in the [[Terrytoons]] short ''[[Heckle and Jeckle#Production history|The Talking Magpies]]'' (1946) is also a recognizably Hugh Herbertesque bird. In 1939 Herbert signed with [[Universal Pictures]], where, as at Warners, he played supporting roles in major films, and leading roles in minor ones. One of his best-received performances from this period is in the [[Olsen and Johnson]] comedy ''[[Hellzapoppin' (film)|Hellzapoppin']]'', in which he played a nutty detective.&lt;ref name="imdb"&gt;{{IMDb name|0001890}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Herbert joined [[Columbia Pictures]] in 1943 and became a familiar face in short subjects, with the same actors and directors who made the Stooges shorts. He continued to star in these comedies for the remainder of his life.

Herbert wrote six screenplays, co-writing the screenplays for the films ''[[Lights of New York (1928 film)|Lights of New York]]'' (1928) and ''[[Second Wife (1930 film)|Second Wife]]'' (1930) and contributing to ''[[The Great Gabbo]]'' (1929), among others. He acted in a few films co-written by the much more prolific (but unrelated) screenwriter [[F. Hugh Herbert]]: ''[[Fashions of 1934]]'' (1934), ''[[We're in the Money (film)|We're in the Money]]'' (1935) and ''[[Colleen (1936 film)|Colleen]]'' (1936). He also directed one film, ''[[He Knew Women]]'' (1930).&lt;ref name="imdb"/&gt;

==Recognition==
Herbert has a star at 6251 Hollywood Boulevard on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]. It was dedicated February 8, 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hugh Herbert|url=http://www.walkoffame.com/hugh-herbert|website=Hollywood Walk of Fame|accessdate=September 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life and death==
Herbert was married to Rose Epstein, who was also known by the name Anita Pam.&lt;ref name="xdg"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/3263578/xenia_daily_gazette/|title=Can't Discard Funny Face|last1=Harrison|first1=Paul|date=August 31, 1936|work=Xenia Daily Gazette|accessdate=September 20, 2015|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|agency=Newspaper Enterprise Association|page=8|via=Newspapers.com}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Herbert died on March 12, 1952 at the age of 66 from [[cardiovascular disease]] in [[North Hollywood, Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name=lat/&gt;

==Brother==
Hugh's brother, [[Tom Herbert]], was a screen comedian who played mildly flustered roles. Fans of [[Laurel and Hardy]] and [[The Three Stooges]] may recall Tom Herbert as the nervous bartender confronted by [[Lupe VÃ©lez]] in ''[[Hollywood Party (1934 film)|Hollywood Party]]'' (1934). Tom Herbert is featured in the [[Warner Brothers]] short subject ''Double or Nothing'' (1940) as his brother Hugh's movie double.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}
