'''Richard Michael Mayall''' (7 March 1958&amp;nbsp;– 9 June 2014) was an English comedian, actor and writer. Mayall formed a close partnership with [[Ade Edmondson]] while they were students at [[Victoria University of Manchester|Manchester University]], and became a pioneer of [[alternative comedy]] in the 1980s.

Mayall starred in numerous cult classic sitcoms throughout his career, including ''[[The Young Ones (TV series)|The Young Ones]]'', ''[[The Comic Strip|The Comic Strip Presents...]]'', ''[[Blackadder]]'', ''[[Filthy Rich &amp; Catflap]]'', ''[[The New Statesman]]'', and ''[[Bottom (TV series)|Bottom]]''. Mayall also starred in the comedy films ''[[Drop Dead Fred]]'' and ''[[Guest House Paradiso]]'', and won a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance|Primetime Emmy Award]] for his voice-over work in ''[[The Wind in the Willows (1995 film)#Sequel|The Willows in Winter]]''. His comedic style was described as energetic "post-punk".&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald"&gt;{{cite news|title=Rik Mayall's wife mystified by his death at age 56|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501119&amp;objectid=11270882|accessdate=10 June 2014|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mayall died suddenly on 9 June 2014 at the age of 56. [[BBC Television]] director [[Danny Cohen (television executive)|Danny Cohen]] praised him as a "truly brilliant" comedian with a unique stage presence, whose "fireball creativity" and approach to sitcom had inspired a generation of comedy stars.&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald" /&gt;

==Early life==
The second of four children, Richard Michael Mayall was born on 7 March 1958 at 98 Pittmans Field in [[Harlow]], [[Essex]]&lt;ref name=BBCObit&gt;{{cite news|title=Obituary: Rik Mayall|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-27765539|accessdate=10 June 2014|work=[[BBC News]]|date=9 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; to Gillian (née Harrild; born 1930) and John Mayall (1925–2011). He had an older brother, Anthony, and two younger sisters, Libby and Kate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rik Mayall Biography (1958-)|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/96/Rik-Mayall.html|website=Film Reference|publisher=Advameg, Inc.|accessdate=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Mayall was three years old, he and his parents—who taught drama—moved to [[Droitwich Spa]], [[Worcestershire]],&lt;ref name="BirminghamMail"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gibbons|first1=Brett|title=Comedian and actor Rik Mayall dies aged 56|url=http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/rik-mayall-dies-aged-56-7240431|accessdate=10 June 2014|work=[[Birmingham Mail]]|date=9 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he spent the rest of his childhood and performed in his parents' plays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tributes paid to Droitwich comedian Rik Mayall|url=http://www.droitwichadvertiser.co.uk/news/local/11268089.Tributes_paid_to_Droitwich_comedian_Rik_Mayall/?ref=var_0|accessdate=11 June 2014|work=Droitwich Advertiser|date=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After attending [[King's School, Worcester]], where he obtained a free scholarship and failed most of his O-levels and scraped through A-levels,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rik Mayall's anarchic life|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/rik-mayalls-anarchic-life/story-fnb64oi6-1226949174975|accessdate=10 June 2014|work=[[The Australian]]|date=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mayall went to the [[Victoria University of Manchester|University of Manchester]] in 1975 to study drama, where he met his future comedy partner [[Ade Edmondson]].&lt;ref name="FunniestGuardian"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ellis-Petersen|first1=Hannah|title=Rik Mayall: 'the funniest man of his generation'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/jun/09/rik-mayall-dies-funniest-man-generation-young-ones|accessdate=10 June 2014|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There he also met [[Ben Elton]], a fellow student, and [[Lise Mayer]], with whom he later co-wrote ''[[The Young Ones (TV series)|The Young Ones]]''.&lt;ref name="BirminghamMail"/&gt;

==Career==

===''Young Ones'' and ''The Comic Strip''===
Edmondson and Mayall gained their reputation at [[The Comedy Store, London|The Comedy Store]], from 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fletcher|first1=Alex|last2=Nissim|first2=Mayer|title=Rik Mayall 1958-2014 obituary: A true one-off and comedy eccentric|url=http://www.digitalspy.com.au/showbiz/news/a576504/rik-mayall-1958-2014-obituary-a-true-one-off-and-comedy-eccentric.html|accessdate=10 June 2014|work=[[Digital Spy]]|date=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from performing in their [[double act]], [[20th Century Coyote]], Mayall developed solo routines, using characters such as [[Kevin Turvey]] and a pompous anarchist poet named Rick.&lt;ref name="IndepedentObit"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Maume|first1=Chris|title=Rik Mayall: Comedian and actor who helped revolutionise the British comedy scene as the punk poet and Cliff Richard fan, Rick|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/rik-mayall-comedian-and-actor-who-helped-revolutionise-the-british-comedy-scene-as-the-punk-poet-and-cliff-richard-fan-rick-9517274.html|accessdate=10 June 2014|work=[[The Independent]]|date=9 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to Edmondson and Mayall, along with Comedy Store [[Master of Ceremonies|compere]] [[Alexei Sayle]] and other upcoming comedians, including [[Nigel Planer]], [[Peter Richardson (actor)|Peter Richardson]], [[French and Saunders]], [[Arnold Brown (comedian)|Arnold Brown]] and [[Pete Richens]], setting up their own comedy club called "[[The Comic Strip]]"&lt;ref name="Over21-1981"&gt;{{cite web | first=David | last=Johnson | title= Something Funny is Happening in Stripland | url= https://shapersofthe80s.com/seismic-shifts/1980-a-new-decade-demands-new-comedy/ |work=Over21, page 36, republished at Shapersofthe80s | location=London | accessdate=2018-04-07 |date=1981-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Raymond Revuebar]], a strip club in Soho.&lt;ref name=BBCObit/&gt; Mayall's Kevin Turvey character gained a regular slot in ''[[A Kick Up the Eighties]]'', first broadcast in 1981. He appeared as "Rest Home" Ricky in [[Richard O'Brien]]'s ''[[Shock Treatment]]'', a sequel to ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]''. He played Dentonvale's resident attendant as the love interest to Nell Campbell's Nurse Ansalong.

Mayall's television appearances as Kevin Turvey led to a [[mockumentary]] based on the character titled ''Kevin Turvey&amp;nbsp;– The Man Behind The Green Door'', broadcast in 1982. The previous year, he appeared in a bit role in ''[[An American Werewolf in London]]''. His stage partnership with Edmondson continued, with them often appearing together as "[[The Dangerous Brothers]]", hapless daredevils whose hyper-violent antics foreshadowed their characters in ''[[Bottom (TV series)|Bottom]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Singh|first1=Anita|title=Rik Mayall dies aged 56|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/comedy/comedy-news/10887182/Rik-Mayall-dies-aged-56.html|accessdate=10 June 2014|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=9 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Channel 4]] offered the Comic Strip group six short films, which became ''[[The Comic Strip|The Comic Strip Presents...]]'', debuting on 2 November 1982. The series, which continued sporadically for many years, saw Mayall play a wide variety of roles. It was known for anti-establishment humour and for parodies such as ''[[Bad News (band)|Bad News on Tour]]'', a spoof "[[rockumentary]]" starring Mayall, Richardson, Edmondson and Planer as a [[heavy metal music|heavy metal band]].

At the time ''The Comic Strip Presents...'' was negotiated, the [[BBC]] took an interest in ''[[The Young Ones (TV series)|The Young Ones]]'', a sitcom written by Mayall and his then-girlfriend [[Lise Mayer]], in the same [[anarchy|anarchic]] vein as ''Comic Strip''. Ben Elton joined the writers. The series was commissioned and first broadcast in 1982, shortly before ''Comic Strip''. Mayall played Rick, a pompous sociology student and [[Cliff Richard]] devotee. Mayall maintained his double-act with Edmondson, who starred as violent [[punk rock|punk]] Vyvyan. [[Nigel Planer]] (as hippie Neil) and [[Christopher Ryan]] (as "Mike the cool person") also starred, with additional material written and performed by [[Alexei Sayle]].

The first series was successful and a second was screened in 1984. The show owed a comic debt to [[Spike Milligan]], but Milligan was disapproving of Mayall. Milligan once wrote: "Rik Mayall is putrid&amp;nbsp;– absolutely vile. He thinks nose-picking is funny and farting and all that. He is the arsehole of British comedy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McSmith|first=Andy|authorlink=Andy McSmith|title=No Such Thing As Society: A History of Britain in the 1980s|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qXlHAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT149|accessdate=10 June 2014|date=16 September 2010|publisher=Constable &amp; Robinson|isbn=978-1-84901-661-2|page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, Mayall played the Detective in the video of "[[Peter Gunn (song)|Peter Gunn]]" by [[Art of Noise]] featuring [[Duane Eddy]].

===Becoming a household name===
Mayall continued to work on ''The Comic Strip'' films. He returned to [[stand-up comedy]], performing on ''[[Saturday Live (UK TV series)|Saturday Live]]''—a British version of the American ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''—first broadcast in 1985. He and Edmondson had a regular section as "[[The Dangerous Brothers]]", their earlier stage act. In 1985, Mayall debuted another comic creation. He had appeared in the final episode of the first series of ''[[The Black Adder|Blackadder]]'' (1983) as "Mad Gerald". He returned to play [[Lord Flashheart]] in the ''[[Blackadder II]]'' episode titled "[[Bells (Blackadder)|Bells]]". A descendant of this character, Squadron Commander Flashheart, was in the ''[[Blackadder Goes Forth]]'' episode "[[Private Plane]]". In the same episode, he was reunited with Edmondson, who played German flying ace [[Manfred von Richthofen|Baron von Richthofen]] the "Red Baron", in a scene where he comes to rescue Captain Blackadder from the Germans. A decade later, Mayall also appeared in ''[[Blackadder: Back &amp; Forth]]'' as [[Robin Hood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Monahan|first1=Mark|title=Rik Mayall: his 10 best performances|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/comedy/comedy-news/10887182/Rik-Mayall-dies-aged-56.html|publisher=Daily Telegraph|accessdate=9 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, Mayall joined [[Nigel Planer|Planer]], Edmondson and Elton to star as Richie Rich in ''[[Filthy Rich &amp; Catflap]]'', which was billed as a follow-up to ''The Young Ones''. The idea of ''Filthy Rich and Catflap'' was a reaction to comments made by [[Jimmy Tarbuck]] about ''The Young Ones''. The series' primary focus was to highlight the "has been" status of light entertainment. While Mayall received positive critical reviews, viewing figures were poor and the series was never repeated on the BBC. In later years, release on video, DVD and repeats on UK TV found a following. Mayall suggested that the series did not last because he was uncomfortable acting in an Elton project, when they had been co-writers on ''The Young Ones''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=The Young Ones |series=[[Comedy Connections]] |first1=Eric Haynes |last1=Ngowan |first2=Lucy |last2=Bacon |network=[[BBC]] |date=2 August 2004 |seriesno=2 |number=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, Mayall had a No. 1 hit in the [[UK Singles Chart]], when he and his co-stars from ''The Young Ones'' teamed with [[Cliff Richard]] to record "[[Living Doll (song)|Living Doll]]" for the inaugural [[Comic Relief]] campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sherwin|first1=Adam|title=Rik Mayall's 'lost' England World Cup anthem crashes into Top 40 as tribute to late comic|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/rik-mayalls-lost-england-world-cup-anthem-crashes-into-top-40-as-tribute-to-late-comic-9529795.html|accessdate=17 June 2014|work=The Independent|date=11 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mayall played Rick one last time in the Comic Relief stage-show and supported the Comic Relief cause for the rest of his life.  1987 saw Mayall co-star with Edmondson in one episode of the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] sitcom ''[[Hardwicke House]]'', although adverse reaction from press and viewers saw ITV withdrew the series after two episodes, leaving their appearance unbroadcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jones|first1=Paul|title=Mrs Ed Miliband's role in "banned" TV show revealed|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2011-05-27/mrs-ed-milibands-role-in-banned-tv-show-revealed|accessdate=17 June 2014|work=[[Radio Times]]|date=27 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.ukonline.co.uk/sotcaa/sotcaa.html?/sotcaa/archive/hardwicke.html |title=Archive Review: Hardwicke House |first=TJ |last=Worthington |date=2006 |website=Some Of The Corpses Are Amusing |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220205434/http://web.ukonline.co.uk/sotcaa/sotcaa.html?%2Fsotcaa%2Farchive%2Fhardwicke.html |archivedate=20 December 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He appeared on the children's television series ''[[Jackanory]]''. His crazed portrayal of [[Roald Dahl]]'s ''[[George's Marvellous Medicine]]'' proved memorable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New chapter opening for Jackanory|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4648357.stm|accessdate=10 June 2014|work=BBC News|date=4 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the BBC received complaints "with viewers claiming both story and presentation to be both dangerous and offensive".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.televisionheaven.co.uk/jackanory.htm |title=Jackanory (1965) |first=Laurence |last=Marcus |date=14 October 2004 |website=Television Heaven}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, Mayall played fictional [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative MP]] Alan Beresford B'Stard in the sitcom ''[[The New Statesman]]'' ([[Yorkshire Television]]) written by [[Laurence Marks (British writer)|Laurence Marks]] and [[Maurice Gran]]. The character was a satirical portrait of [[Tory]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]]s in the United Kingdom in the 1980s and early 1990s. The programme ran for four series—incorporating two BBC specials—between 1987 and '94 and was successful critically and in the ratings. In a similar vein to his appearance on ''Jackanory'', in 1989 Mayall starred in a series of bit shows for ITV called ''[[Grim Tales]]'', in which he narrated [[Brothers Grimm|Grimm Brothers]] [[fairy tale]]s while puppets acted the stories. In the early 1990s, Mayall starred in humorous adverts for [[Nintendo]] games and consoles. With money from the ads, he bought his house in London which he called "Nintendo Towers".&lt;ref name="IndepedentObit"/&gt;

===1990s===
In 1991, Edmondson and Mayall co-starred in the West End production of [[Samuel Beckett|Beckett]]'s ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'' at the [[Queen's Theatre]], with Mayall playing Vladimir, Edmondson as Estragon and [[Christopher Ryan]] as Lucky.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hutchings|first=William|title=Samuel Beckett's Waiting for Godot: A Reference Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mA7ujVOEWu0C&amp;pg=PA96|accessdate=11 June 2014|date=1 January 2005|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-30879-6|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here they came up with the idea for ''[[Bottom (TV series)|Bottom]]'', which they said was a cruder cousin to ''Waiting for Godot''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sims|first1=David|title=Remembering Rik Mayall, Britain's Finest Comic Firecracker|url=http://www.thewire.com/entertainment/2014/06/remembering-rik-mayall-britains-finest-comic-firecracker/372448/|publisher=The Wire|accessdate=9 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bottom'' was commissioned by the BBC and three series were shown between 1991 and 1995. Mayall appeared in ''Bottom'' as Richard 'Richie' Richard alongside Edmondson's Eddie Elizabeth Hitler. The series featured [[slapstick]] violence taken to new extremes, and gained a strong cult following.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=British comedian Rik Mayall known for his off-beat slapstick|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/celebrity-news/british-comedian-rik-mayall-known-for-his-off-beat-slapstick/article19084447/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20140611094740/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/celebrity-news/british-comedian-rik-mayall-known-for-his-off-beat-slapstick/article19084447/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=11 June 2014|accessdate=11 June 2014|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]|agency=[[Reuters]]|date=9 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, following the second series, Mayall and Edmondson decided to take a stage-show version of the series on a national tour, ''Bottom: Live''. It was a commercial success, filling large venues. Four additional stage shows were embarked upon in 1995, 1997, 2001 and 2003, each meeting with great success. The violent nature of these shows saw both Edmondson and Mayall ending up in hospital at various points. A film version, ''[[Guest House Paradiso]]'', was released in 1999. A fourth TV series was also written, but not commissioned by the BBC.

Mayall starred alongside [[Phoebe Cates]] in ''[[Drop Dead Fred]]'' (1991) as the eponymous character, a troublesome [[imaginary friend]] who reappears from a woman's childhood. He also appeared in ''[[Carry On Columbus]]'' (1992) with other alternative comedians. Mayall also provided the voice of the character Froglip, the prince of the [[goblin]]s, in the 1992 animated film adaption of the 1872 children's tale ''[[The Princess and the Goblin]]'' by [[George MacDonald]]. In 1993, he appeared in ''Rik Mayall Presents'', six individual comedy dramas (Micky Love / Briefest Encounter / [[Dancing Queen (1993 film)|Dancing Queen]] / The Big One / Dirty Old Town / Clair de Lune). Mayall's performances won him a Best Comedy Performer award at that year's [[British Comedy Awards]], and a second series of three was broadcast in early 1995. He provided the voice for Little Sod in [[Simon Brett]]'s ''[[How to Be a Little Sod]]'', written in 1991 and adapted as ten consecutive episodes broadcast by the BBC in 1995. In the early 1990s, he auditioned for the roles of Banzai, Zazu and Timon in ''[[The Lion King]]'' (1994); he was asked to audition by lyricist [[Tim Rice]], but the role of Zazu finally went to [[Rowan Atkinson]].

In 1995, Mayall featured in a production of the play ''[[Cell Mates (play)|Cell Mates]]'' alongside [[Stephen Fry]]. Not long into the run, Fry had a [[nervous breakdown]] and fled to Belgium, where he remained for several days, and the play closed early.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hill|first1=Amelia|title=Stephen Fry returns to London stage 17 years after abandoning Cell Mates|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/sep/21/stephen-fry-on-stage-twelfth-night|accessdate=10 June 2014|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=22 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Mayall said of the incident: "You don't leave the trenches … selfishness is one thing, being a cunt is another. I mustn't start that war again."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.orangeneko.com/Rik/library/theatre111.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070519165745/http://www.orangeneko.com/Rik/library/theatre111.htm |archivedate=19 May 2007 |title=Rik Mayall - Theatre.com |first=Mark |last=Shenton |website=The Rik Mayall Website |date=11 January 2007 |accessdate=14 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edmondson poked fun at the event during their stage tours. In ''[[Bottom Live: The Big Number Two Tour]]'', after Mayall gave mocking gestures to the audience and insulted their town in a silly voice, Edmondson said, "Have you finished yet? It's just I'm beginning to understand why Stephen Fry fucked off."  In ''[[Bottom Live 2003: Weapons Grade Y-Fronts Tour]]'', after Richie accidentally fondles Eddie, he replies, "I see why Stephen Fry left that play." Towards the end of the ''Cell Mates'' run, Mayall revealed a replica gun—a prop from the play—to a passer-by in the street. Mayall was cautioned over the incident and later conceded that this was "incredibly stupid, even by my standards".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orangeneko.com/Rik/library/telegra8.htm |title=Police Rebuke Rik Mayall for 'Stupid' Gun Prank |website=The Rik Mayall Website |date= |accessdate=14 June 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220055909/http://www.orangeneko.com/Rik/library/telegra8.htm |archivedate=20 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1999, Mayall was the voice of the black-headed seagull Kehaar, in the first and second series of the animated television programme, ''[[Watership Down]]''. In the late 1990s Mayall was featured in a number of adverts for [[Virgin Trains]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsc6joUzgcY |title=Rik Mayall "Virgin Trains" Advert 2. |website=[[YouTube]] |date=6 November 2010 |accessdate=19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, Mayall was involved in a serious [[quad bike]] accident. (For details see below.) The pair wrote the first draft of their feature film ''[[Guest House Paradiso]]'' while Mayall was still hospitalised. They planned to co-direct, but Edmondson took on the duties himself. Mayall returned to work doing [[voice acting|voice-overs]]. His first post-accident acting job was in the 1998 ''[[Jonathan Creek]]'' Christmas special, as DI Gideon Pryke, a role he later reprised in 2013.

===2000s===
In 2000, Mayall voiced all characters for the [[PlayStation]] and Windows PC video game ''[[Hogs of War]]''. Also that year, Mayall appeared in the video production of ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]'' as [[Herod Antipas|King Herod]]. He joked in the "making of" documentary, which was included on the DVD release, that "the real reason why millions of people want to come and see this is because I'm in it! Me and Jesus!" In 2001 Mayall acted as Lt Daniel Blaney in the episode "The White Knight Stratagem" from the series "Murder Rooms: The Mysteries of the Real Sherlock Holmes." In 2002, Mayall teamed up with Marks and Gran once more when he starred as Professor Adonis Cnut in the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] sitcom, ''[[Believe Nothing]]''. However, the sitcom failed to repeat the success of ''The New Statesman'' and lasted for only one series.

Following 2003's ''Bottom: Live'' tour, ''Bottom 5: Weapons Grade Y-Fronts'', Mayall stated that he and Edmondson would return with another tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.orangeneko.com/Rik/faq/tourbottom.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20041028031616/http://www.orangeneko.com/Rik/faq/tourbottom.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=28 October 2004 |title=The Rik Mayall FAQ |website=Orangeneko.com |date= |accessdate=14 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, however, Edmondson told the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' that he no longer wished to work on ''Bottom''. This effectively dissolved their quarter-century-long partnership. Edmondson claimed they were "too old" to continue portraying the characters. Edmondson added that since Mayall had recovered from his coma, he was slower on the uptake and it had become more difficult to work with him, citing as well that due to taking medication Mayall, had been advised to stop drinking alcohol. However, Edmondson said that the pair remained very close friends.&lt;ref&gt;Article in the ''Daily Mail'' "Weekend" supplement (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 Mayall had a starring cameo role playing the record boss in the video short "ABBA: Our Last Video Ever". &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0415473/|title=ABBA: Our Last Video Ever|date=12 May 2004|accessdate=7 August 2018|website=IMDb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mayall voiced Edwin in the BBC show ''[[Shoebox Zoo]]''. In September 2005, he released an 'in-character' semi-fictionalised autobiography titled ''Bigger than Hitler, Better than Christ'' ({{ISBN|0-00-720727-1}}). At the same time, he starred in a new series for ITV, ''All About George''. In 2006, Mayall reprised the role of Alan B'Stard in the play ''The New Statesman 2006: Blair B'stard Project'', written by Marks and Gran. By this time B'Stard had left the floundering Conservatives and become a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour MP]]. In 2007, following a successful two-month run in London's West End at the [[Trafalgar Studios]], a heavily re-written version toured theatres nationwide, with Marks and Gran constantly updating the script to keep it topical. However, Mayall succumbed to chronic [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]] and [[influenza|flu]] in May 2007 and withdrew from the show. Alan B'Stard was played by his understudy, Mike Sherman during his hiatus.

Mayall was cast as the [[poltergeist]] Peeves in ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'' (2001), the first of the [[Harry Potter (film series)|''Harry Potter'' films]], although all of his scenes were cut from the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Coveney|first1=Michael|title=Rik Mayall obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/jun/09/rik-mayall|accessdate=10 June 2014|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed in his semi-autobiographical book ''Bigger than Hitler, Better than Christ'' that he had not been made aware that his scenes had been cut until the full film was officially unveiled at the premiere. He told the story of this hiring/firing on his second website blog for his film, ''[[Evil Calls: The Raven]]'' (2008).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|archivedate=10 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; For ''Evil Calls'', Mayall's role as Winston the Butler was shot in 2002, when the film was titled ''Alone in the Dark''. The film was not completed until 2008, and was released under its new ''Evil Calls'' title, to distance it from the ''[[Alone in the Dark]]'' computer game film.

Mayall provided the voice of the [[Andrex]] puppy in the TV commercials for [[Andrex]] toilet paper, and also had a voice part in the [[Domestos]] cleaning product adverts. He performed the voice of [[King Arthur]] in the children's television cartoon series, ''King Arthur's Disasters'', alongside [[Matt Lucas]] who plays Merlin. Mayall also had a recurring role in the Channel Five remake of the lighthearted drama series, ''[[Minder (TV series)|Minder]]''. He also provided the voice of Cufflingk in the 2005 animated film ''[[Valiant (film)|Valiant]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://voicechasers.com/database/showprod.php?prodid=849|title=The Voices of Valiant (2005, Animated Film) - Voice Cast Listing at Voice Chasers|author=|date=|work=Voice Chasers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2009, Mayall played a supporting role in the television programme ''[[Midsomer Murders]]''—shown on [[ITV1]] and made by [[Meridian Broadcasting]]—as David Roper, a recovering party animal and tenuous friend of the families in and around Chettham Park House.

===2010–2014===
In April 2010, Motivation Records released Mayall's England Football anthem "Noble England" for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] which he recorded with producer Dave Loughran at [[Sarm East Studios|Brick Lane Studios]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rik Mayall does a Noble thing in Coventry|url=http://www.coventrytelegraph.net/news/coventry-news/watch-rik-mayalls-world-cup-7259898|website=Coventrytelegraph.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; The release, on 26 April, was designed to coincide with [[St George's Day]] and the baptism of [[Shakespeare]]. On the track, Mayall performs an adapted speech from Shakespeare's Henry V. In June 2010, the official BBC ''[[Match of the Day]]'' compilation CD (2010 Edition) was released by Sony/Universal featuring Noble England. After Mayall's death in 2014, a campaign led by [[Jon Morter]] began to get "Noble England" to No. 1 during the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]]. It rapidly climbed the official charts in the United Kingdom and reached no. 7.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nme.com/news/various-artists/77886|title=Rik Mayall World Cup single breaks into Top 10 of Official UK Singles Chart|publisher=NME|date=13 June 2014|accessdate=19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2010, an audio book, narrated by Mayall, ''Cutey and the Sofaguard'' was released by Digital Download. The book was written by Chris Wade and released by Wisdom Twins Books. In this same month, Mayall played the voice of Roy's Dad and recorded five episodes of animation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dogjudo.com/ |title=Dog Judo |publisher=Dog Judo |date=2 September 2013 |accessdate=14 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November, Mayall provided narrative for five different characters for CDs accompanying children's books published by Clickety Books. The books aid speech and language development by bombarding the child with troublesome sound targets. He recorded introductions and narratives for the titles.

On 5 March 2011, Mayall appeared on ''[[Let's Dance for Comic Relief]]'' in which he came on stage and attacked Ade Edmondson with a [[frying pan]] during his performance of ''[[The Dying Swan]]'' ballet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rik Mayall - obituary|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/10887186/Rik-Mayall-obituary.html|accessdate=11 June 2014|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=9 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edmondson mentioned backstage that it was the first time in eight years they had done something like that together and claimed Mayall had left his head with a small bump. It would be the last time the duo performed together in public.

In April 2011, Mayall again revived the character of Alan B'Stard to make an appearance in a satirical television advertisement for the [[No2AV]] campaign prior to the 2011 voting reform referendum in the UK. The character is shown being elected under the alternative vote system, then using his newly gained position of power to renege on his campaign promises. In his personal life, Rik Mayall did not support the alternative vote. In May, Mayall became the eponymous 'Bombardier' in a TV advertising campaign for [[Bombardier Bitter]] in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedrum.com/news/2011/05/12/rik-mayall-stars-pound4m-campaign-bombardier-beer |title=The Drum |publisher=The Drum |date=13 May 2011 |accessdate=14 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The adverts landed broadcaster UKTV Dave in trouble with [[Ofcom]] when they were found to breach the Ofcom code for linking alcohol with sexual attractiveness or success.&lt;ref name="Such Small Portions"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.suchsmallportions.com/news/blackadder-rik-mayall-ad-lands-dave-ofcom-rebuke |title=Blackadder-like Rik Mayall ad lands Dave with a Ofcom rebuke |publisher=Such Small Portions |date=8 October 2012 |accessdate=7 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 August 2012, the BBC announced that Edmondson and Mayall's characters of Richie and Eddie would be returning in 2013 in ''[[Hooligan's Island]]'', a television adaptation of their 1997 tour of the same name.&lt;ref name="bbcmedia"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2012/hooligans-island.html |title=BBC Two commissions Hooligans' Island with Rik Mayall and Ade Edmondson |publisher=BBC Media Centre |date=23 August 2012 |accessdate=23 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on 15 October 2012, Edmondson announced during an interview with BBC radio presenter [[Mark Powlett]] that the project was cancelled prior to production as he wished to pursue other interests.

In September 2012, Mayall starred in ''The Last Hurrah'', a six-episode, full-cast audio series that he also co-wrote with Craig Green and Dominic Vince.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelasthurrah.co.uk/ |title=The Last Hurrah |publisher=The Last Hurrah |date= |accessdate=14 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2012, Mayall narrated several children's books on the Me Books app, such as ''The Getaway'' and ''Banana!'' by children's illustrator and author Ed Vere.

In October 2013 he appeared in [[Channel 4]] sitcom ''[[Man Down (TV series)|Man Down]]'', playing the father of the protagonist, [[Greg Davies]]—despite being only ten years older.

On 7 May 2014, Mayall made one of his last recorded performances in the form of poetry and voice-overs read on English rock band Magic Eight Ball's second album 'Last Of The Old Romantics' (released on 10 November 2014).

Mayall's final TV appearance was in the first episode of the second series of ''[[Crackanory]]'' which was broadcast on 24 September 2014 on [[Dave (TV channel)|Dave]].

==Personal life==

===Family===
Mayall married Scottish [[make-up artist]] Barbara Robbin in 1985, and the couple had three children: Rosie (born 1986), Sidney (born 1988) and Bonnie (born 1995). The couple met in 1981 while filming ''[[A Kick Up the Eighties]]'' and embarked on a secret affair. At the time, Mayall was in a long-term relationship with [[Lise Mayer]]. Upon finding out Robbin was pregnant, Mayall left Mayer while on a shopping trip with her and [[Ben Elton]], and eloped with Robbin to [[Barbados]]. Mayer would later suffer a [[miscarriage]]. In a 2002 newspaper article, Mayall said that Mayer had since forgiven him.&lt;ref name="laws"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Laws|first1=Roz|title=I ran away from her in the January sales to wed secret lover; Rik Mayall Tells How He Cheated on Deayton's Girl|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/I+ran+away+from+her+in+the+January+sales+to+wed+secret+lover%3B+RIK...-a095918914|accessdate=10 June 2014|work=[[Sunday Mercury]]|date=29 December 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics===
Mayall twice publicly involved himself in political campaigns. In 2002 he dressed up as [[Adolf Hitler]] for a cinema advertisement opposing the United Kingdom abolishing its national currency the [[Pound Sterling]] in favour of the [[Euro]], as a part of its membership of the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;'Comic defends Euro Hitler spoof', B.B.C.

===Quad bike accident===
On 9 April 1998, Mayall was injured after crashing a [[quad bike]] near his home in [[Devon]].&lt;ref name="SeriouslyIll"&gt;{{cite news|title=Comedian Rik Mayall 'seriously ill'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/77157.stm|accessdate=10 June 2014|work=BBC News|date=11 April 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mayall's daughter Bonnie and her cousin had asked him to take them for a ride on the bike—a Christmas gift from his wife—but he refused because there was already a spit of rain falling, indicating further rain, and he went on out alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mayall remembered nothing about the accident. His mind remained "a total blank." His wife Barbara looked out of the window and saw him lying on the ground trapped beneath the quad, apparently turned over on top of him.&lt;ref name="ForeverYoung"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barber|first1=Lynn|title=Rik Mayall: Forever young|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/dec/17/features.magazine|accessdate=11 June 2014|work=The Guardian|date=17 December 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mayall tells the story that his wife believed it was just his silly joking and she initially left him for a few minutes. But Mayall was airlifted to [[Plymouth]]'s [[Derriford Hospital]],&lt;ref name="SeriouslyIll"/&gt; with two [[haematoma]]s and a fractured skull.&lt;ref name="ForeverYoung"/&gt; During the following 96 hours, he was kept sedated to prevent movement which could cause pressure on his brain. His family was warned that he could die or have brain damage. He was in a coma for several days.&lt;ref name="ForeverYoung"/&gt; After five days doctors felt it safe to bring Mayall back to consciousness.

During Mayall's hospitalisation, ''The Comic Strip'' special, ''Four Men in a Car'', was broadcast for the first time. The film involves Mayall's character being hit by a car.&lt;ref name="IndepedentObit"/&gt; Mayall and Edmondson joked about the event in stage versions of ''Bottom'', Edmondson quipping "If only I'd fixed those brakes properly," and Mayall referring to himself: "You must know him, that tosser who fell off the quad bike."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BREAKING NEWS: Rik Mayall dies aged 56|url=http://www.torquayheraldexpress.co.uk/BREAKING-NEWS-Rik-Mayall-dies-aged-56/story-21208263-detail/story.html|accessdate=11 June 2014|work=[[Herald Express]]|date=9 June 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140612212845/http://www.torquayheraldexpress.co.uk/BREAKING-NEWS-Rik-Mayall-dies-aged-56/story-21208263-detail/story.html|archivedate=12 June 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 2005 spoof autobiography, Mayall claims that he [[resurrection|rose from the dead]].

==Death==
On 9 June 2014, Mayall died at his home in [[Barnes, London|Barnes]], [[London Borough of Richmond upon Thames|Richmond-upon-Thames]], [[London]], from a [[heart attack]] after [[jogging]].  He was 56 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/rik-mayall-cause-of-death-comedian-suffered-a-heart-attack-wife-confirms-9532662.html|title=Rik Mayall cause of death: Comedian 'suffered a heart attack' wife confirms|author=|date=|work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*2014, on his death, ''[[The Guardian]]'' described Mayall as an actor whose "onscreen performances were so full of life. His characters weren't neatly drawn sketches: they were vast mad scribbles, jammed to the margins with noise and energy". Commenting of his role in the sitcom ''[[Blackadder]]'', it noted, "Upstaging an entire fleet of world-class comedians should have been impossible. Mayall made it look effortless", and that he had replicated this success in his other best-known shows, by becoming the "face of the show" in ''[[The Young Ones (TV series)|The Young Ones]]'' and creating an "iconic" figure in ''[[The New Statesman]]'' character, [[Alan B'Stard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Heritage|first1=Stuart|title=Rik Mayall's funniest TV moments – in clips|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/jun/09/rik-mayalls-funniest-tv-moments-young-ones-bottom|accessdate=11 June 2014|work=The Guardian|date=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
