==Early life==
French was born in [[Holyhead]], to [[English people|English]] parents Denys Vernon French (5 August 1932 – 11 September 1977)&lt;ref&gt;Births, Marriages and Deaths Index – England &amp; Wales&lt;/ref&gt; and Felicity Roma French (''née'' O'Brien) (1934 — 2012) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/showbiz/316187/Dawn-French-I-ve-lost-the-mum-who-inspired-me|title=Dawn French: I've lost the mum who inspired me|first=Julie|last=Carpenter|date=24 April 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; who married in their hometown of [[Plymouth]] in 1953. She was educated at the independent St Dunstan's Abbey School (now absorbed by [[Plymouth College]]). She has an older brother, Gary (born 1955). Her father served in the [[Royal Air Force]], stationed at [[RAF Valley]]. The RAF partly funded her public education.&lt;ref name="fansite"&gt;[http://dawnfrench.tripod.com/biography.html Dawn French bio] dawnfrench.tripod.com; retrieved 2 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; When her father was stationed at the former [[RAF Faldingworth]], she attended [[Caistor Grammar School]] in [[Caistor]], boarding in the school's Lindsey house. She later won a debating scholarship that brought her to study at the [[Spence School]] in New York.&lt;ref name="fansite"/&gt;

French has claimed that her self-confidence and self-belief stem from her father, who told her how beautiful she was each day.&lt;ref name="farewell"&gt;[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article2223828.ece "Farewell French and Saunders"] ''The Times'' (UK).

She studied at the [[Central School of Speech and Drama]] in 1977, where she met her future comedy partner, [[Jennifer Saunders]].&lt;ref name="farewell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="screenonline"/&gt; Both came from RAF backgrounds. They had grown up on the same base, even having had the same best friend, although never meeting.&lt;ref name="looking"&gt;Decca Aitkenhead, [http://film.guardian.co.uk/interview/interviewpages/0,,1241436,00.html "What are you looking at?"], ''The Guardian'', 19 June 2004; retrieved 5 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; At first, as far as Saunders was concerned, French was a "cocky little upstart". French considered Saunders snooty and aloof.&lt;ref name="looking"/&gt; The comic duo originally did not like each other as French wanted to become a drama teacher&lt;ref name="screenonline"&gt;[http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/499480/index.html Dawn French] – screenonline.org.uk. Retrieved 10 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; whereas Saunders loathed the idea and thus disliked French for being enthusiastic and confident about the course.&lt;ref name="farewell"/&gt;

French and Saunders shared a flat whilst at college and were influenced to do comedy by their flatmates as part of their projects for college. After talking in depth for the first time, they came to be friends.&lt;ref name="farewell"/&gt; While at college she broke up with her fiancé, a former [[Royal Navy]] officer. After they graduated, they formed a double-act called the Menopause Sisters. Saunders has described the act, which involved wearing [[tampons]] in their ears, as "cringeworthy". The manager of the club recalled, "They didn't seem to give a damn. There was no star quality about them at all."&lt;ref name="looking"/&gt; French and Saunders came to public attention as members of [[the Comic Strip]], part of the [[alternative comedy]] scene in the early 1980s.

French has also written a best-selling [[Epistolary novel|epistolary]]&lt;ref name="moves"&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article2241752.ece "Dawn French moves to Cornwall to die"] ''The Times'' (UK); retrieved 6 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; autobiography, which she has titled ''Dear Fatty.''

French said that she became great friends with Saunders well before they started working together, which was "over 30 years ago". The book consists of letters to the different people who have been in her life. In 2017 ''Me. You. A Diary'', French's second book, was released.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/305370/me-you-a-diary/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television===

She acted in 27 of the 37 episodes and wrote two of them.&lt;ref name="screenonline"/&gt; One episode featured a parody of spaghetti westerns and another a black and white film about a hopelessly goofy boy. Some of French's first exposure to a wider audience occurred when comedy producer [[Martin Lewis (humorist)|Martin Lewis]] recorded a ''Comic Strip'' record album in 1981 which featured sketches by French &amp; Saunders. The album was released on Springtime!/Island Records in September 1981 and presented French and Jennifer Saunders to an audience outside London.

This series did not meet with as much success as her earlier roles and it ended in 2004 after two years. {{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

French's biggest solo television role to date has been as the title figure in the long running and popular [[BBC]] comedy ''[[The Vicar of Dibley]]'', which [[Richard Curtis]] created for her.

But she loves her family very much; it's just that she goes over the top sometimes."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2007/12_december/17/lark_french.shtml "Lark Rise To Candleford"] BBC.co.uk; retrieved 30 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2010, French starred in ''[[Roger &amp; Val Have Just Got In]]'' with actor [[Alfred Molina]].
