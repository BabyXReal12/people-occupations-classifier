'''Lucille Désirée Ball''' (August 6, 1911 – April 26, 1989) was an American actress, comedian, model, film-studio executive, and producer.  She was the star of the self-produced sitcoms ''[[I Love Lucy]]'', ''[[The Lucy–Desi Comedy Hour]]'', ''[[The Lucy Show]]'', ''[[Here's Lucy]]'', and ''[[Life with Lucy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.killer-media.com/lucille-ball-biography|title=Lucille Ball Biography|accessdate=January 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ball's career began in 1929 when she landed work as a model. Shortly thereafter, she began her performing career on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] using the [[stage names]] Diane Belmont and Dianne Belmont. She later appeared in several minor film roles in the 1930s and 1940s as a contract player for [[RKO Radio Pictures]], being cast as a chorus girl or in similar roles. During this time, she met Cuban bandleader [[Desi Arnaz]], and the two [[Elopement (marriage)|eloped]] in November 1940. In the 1950s, Ball ventured into television. In 1951, she and Arnaz created the sitcom ''I Love Lucy'', a series that became one of the most beloved programs in television history. The same year, Ball gave birth to their first child, [[Lucie Arnaz]],&lt;ref name="Lucie"/&gt; followed by  [[Desi Arnaz Jr.]] in 1953.&lt;ref name="twoop-bio"/&gt; Ball and Arnaz divorced in May 1960, and she married comedian [[Gary Morton]] in 1961.{{sfn|Sanders|Gilbert|1993|p=216}}

In 1962, Ball became the first woman to run a major television studio, [[Desilu Productions]], which produced many popular television series, including ''[[Mission: Impossible]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"Arnaz Quits Presidency Of Desilu; Former Wife, Lucille Ball, Gets Post", ''Wall Street Journal'', November 9, 1962, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Ball did not back away from acting completely.  She appeared in film and television roles for the rest of her career until her death in April 1989 from an [[Dissecting aortic aneurysm|abdominal aortic dissection]] at the age of 77.&lt;ref name="Morbid"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.morbid-curiosity.com/id125.htm|title=Lucille Ball|accessdate=April 6, 2008|publisher=Morbid Curiosity|quote=Lucille Ball is recovering and dies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ball was nominated for 13 [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s, winning four times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.punoftheday.com/lucille-ball.html|title=Lucille Ball: Biography|accessdate=April 2, 2008|publisher=punoftheday.com|quote=Ball wins four Emmys and nominated for a total of 13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977, Ball was among the first recipients of the Women in Film [[Women in Film Crystal + Lucy Awards#THE CRYSTAL AWARD|Crystal Award]].&lt;ref name=WIF&gt;{{cite web|title=Past Recipients: Crystal Award|url=http://wif.org/past-recipients|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110630083646/http://www.wif.org/past-recipients|dead-url=yes|archive-date=June 30, 2011|work=Women In Film|accessdate=May 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was the recipient of the [[Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award]] in 1979,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goldenglobes.org/cecil70|title=The Cecil B.

==Early life==
Born at 69 Stewart Avenue, [[Jamestown, New York]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.fentonhistorycenter.org/special-features/lucille-ball/the-many-names-of-lucy-and-family/&lt;/ref&gt; Lucille Désirée Ball was the daughter of Henry Durrell Ball (1887–1915) and Désirée "DeDe" Evelyn Ball (née Hunt; 1892–1977). Her family lived in [[Wyandotte, Michigan]] for a time.&lt;ref&gt;Patch, Jason Alley, [http://patch.com/michigan/wyandotte/lucille-ball-lived-in-wyandotte-as-a-young-child], patch.com, August 7, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; She sometimes later claimed that she had been born in [[Butte, Montana]] where her grandparents had lived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxZ-z6R58Ow|title=Dick Cavett Interview|accessdate=April 2, 2008|work=The Dick Cavett Interview (1974)|deadurl=no|postscript=About Lucille Ball's relatives|archiveurl=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxZ-z6R58Ow/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxZ-z6R58Ow|archivedate=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of magazines reported inaccurately that she had decided that Montana was a more romantic place to be born than New York and repeated a fantasy of a "western childhood". But her father had moved the family to [[Anaconda, Montana]] for his work, where they lived briefly, among other places.&lt;ref name="Higham 1986"&gt;Higham, C. (1986). ''Lucy: The Life of Lucille Ball'', New York: St. Martin's Press.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Her family belonged to the [[Baptist]] church. Her ancestors were mostly [[English people|English]], but a few were [[Scottish-Americans|Scottish]], [[French American|French]], and [[Irish Americans|Irish]].{{sfn|Kanfer|2003|p=10}}{{sfn|Ball|1997|pp=168–69}} Some were among the earliest settlers in the Thirteen Colonies, including Elder John Crandall of [[Westerly, Rhode Island]], and [[Edmund Rice (1638)|Edmund Rice]], an early emigrant from England to the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Some Ancestral Remains of Lucille Ball|url=http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nychauta/CEMETERY/ForestHill/LucilleBall.html|publisher=Rootsweb.com|accessdate=October 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edmund-rice.org/era5gens/p3.htm#i334023|title=Isaac Ball (1747-?)|publisher=Edmund Rice (1638) Association. Lucille Desiree Ball (1911–1989) was a descendant of Edmund Rice as follows: Edmund Rice (1594–1663); Henry Rice (1617–1711); Elizabeth Rice (1648–1740); Mary Brewer (1680–?); Isaac Ball (? –1789); Isaac Ball (1747–1790); Isaac Ball (1787–1865); Clinton Manross Ball (1817–1893); Jasper Clinton Ball (1852–933); Henry Durell Ball (1887–1915) and Lucille Désirée Ball (1911–1989)|accessdate=May 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Lucille was three years old, her 27-year-old father died of [[typhoid fever]]. Henry Ball was a [[lineman (technician)|lineman]] for [[Bell Telephone Company]] and was frequently transferred. The family had moved from Jamestown to [[Anaconda, Montana]], and later to [[Trenton, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name="Cavett"/&gt; Her father contracted typhoid and died in February 1915 while DeDe Ball was pregnant with her second child, [[Fred Ball|Frederick]].  Lucille Ball recalled little from the day her father died, but remembered a bird getting trapped in the house. From that day forward, she suffered from [[ornithophobia]].{{sfn|Kanfer|2003|p=12}}

After Ball's father died, her mother returned to New York. Ball and her brother, Fred Henry Ball (1915–2007), were raised by their mother and maternal grandparents in [[Celoron, New York]], a summer resort village on [[Lake Chautauqua]], 2.5 miles west of downtown Jamestown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lucille Ball Biography|url=http://www.notablebiographies.com/Ba-Be/Ball-Lucille.html|work=Encyclopedia of World Biography|accessdate=April 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lucy loved Celoron Park, one of the best amusement areas in the United States at that time. Its boardwalk had a ramp to the lake that served as a children's slide, the Pier Ballroom, a roller-coaster, a bandstand, and a stage where vaudeville concerts and regular theatrical shows were presented which made Celoron Park an entertainment destination.&lt;ref name="Higham 1986"/&gt;

Four years after Henry Ball's death, DeDe Ball married Edward Peterson. While her mother and stepfather looked for work in another city, Peterson's parents cared for her and her brother. Ball's step-grandparents were a [[puritanical]] [[Sweden|Swedish]] couple who banished all mirrors from the house except one over the bathroom sink. When the young Ball was caught admiring herself in it, she was severely chastised for being vain. This period of time affected Ball so deeply that, in later life, she claimed that it lasted seven or eight years.{{sfn|Harris|1991|pp=23-24}}

Peterson was a [[Shriners|Shriner]]. When his organization needed female entertainers for the [[chorus line]] of their next show, he encouraged his 12-year-old stepdaughter to audition.{{sfn|Kanfer|2003|p=16}} While Ball was onstage, she realized performing was a great way to gain praise and recognition. Her appetite for recognition was awakened at an early age.{{sfn|Kanfer|2003|p=20}} In 1927, her family suffered misfortune. Their house and furnishings were lost to settle a financial [[legal judgment]] after a neighborhood boy was accidentally shot and paralyzed by someone [[target shooting]] in their yard under the supervision of Ball's grandfather. The family subsequently moved into a small apartment in Jamestown.{{sfn|Ball|1996|p=41}}

==Career==
===Teenage years and early career===
In 1925, Ball, then only 14, started dating Johnny DeVita, a 21-year-old local hoodlum. DeDe was unhappy with the relationship, but unable to influence her daughter to end it. She expected the romance to burn out in a few weeks, but that did not happen. After about a year, DeDe tried to separate them by exploiting Lucille's desire to be in show business. Despite the family's meager finances, she arranged for Lucille to attend the [[John Murray Anderson]] School for the Dramatic Arts, in New York City,{{sfn|Brady|2001|p=20}}{{sfn|Kanfer|2003|p=24}} where [[Bette Davis]] was a fellow student. Ball later said about that time in her life, "All I learned in drama school was how to be frightened."{{sfn|Kanfer|2003|p=205}} Ball's instructors felt she would not be successful in the entertainment business, and were not afraid to say this in front of her.

In the face of this harsh criticism, Ball was determined to prove her teachers wrong and returned to New York City in 1928. That same year, she began working for [[Hattie Carnegie]] as an in-house model. Carnegie ordered Ball to dye her then-brown hair blonde, and Ball complied. Of this time in her life, Ball said, "Hattie taught me how to slouch properly in a $1,000 hand-sewn sequin dress and how to wear a $40,000 sable coat as casually as rabbit."{{sfn|Kanfer|2003|p=30}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j66uvWzubRwC|title=Ball of Fire: The Tumultuous Life and Comic Art of Lucille Ball|last=Kanfer|first=Stefan|date=2007-12-18|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=9780307424914|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ball's career was thriving when she became ill with [[rheumatoid arthritis]] and was unable to work for two years.&lt;ref name="NetGlimse"/&gt;

In 1932, she moved back to New York City to resume her pursuit of an acting career and supported herself again by working for Carnegie{{sfn|Brady|2001|p=33}} and as the [[Chesterfield (cigarette)|Chesterfield]] [[cigarette girl (person)|cigarette girl]]. Using the name Diane (sometimes spelled Dianne) Belmont, she started getting chorus work on Broadway,{{sfn|Kanfer|2003|p=28}} but it was not lasting. Ball was hired&amp;nbsp;– but then quickly fired&amp;nbsp;– by theatre [[impresario]] [[Earl Carroll]], from his ''Vanities'', and by [[Florenz Ziegfeld]], from a touring company of ''[[Rio Rita (musical)|Rio Rita]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Darryl J. Littleton|author2=Tuezdae Littleton|title=Comediennes: Laugh Be a Lady - "Lucille Ball"|date=2012|publisher=[[Hal Leonard Corporation]]|isbn=9781480329744|page=(eBook)(Chapter 5)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Iz_S7n9bWW8C&amp;pg=PT43#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=April 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hollywood===
After an uncredited stint as a [[Goldwyn Girls|Goldwyn Girl]] in ''[[Roman Scandals]]'' (1933), starring [[Eddie Cantor]] and [[Gloria Stuart]], Ball moved permanently to Hollywood to appear in films. She had many small movie roles in the 1930s as a contract player for [[RKO Radio Pictures]], including a two-reel comedy short with the [[Three Stooges]] (''[[Three Little Pigskins]]'', 1934) and a movie with the [[Marx Brothers]] (''[[Room Service (1938 film)|Room Service]]'', 1938). She also appeared as one of the featured models in the [[Fred Astaire]] and [[Ginger Rogers]] film ''[[Roberta (1935 film)|Roberta]]'' (1935), as the flower girl in ''[[Top Hat]]'' (1935), and in a brief [[supporting role]] at the beginning of ''[[Follow the Fleet]]'' (1936),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=103863 |title=Lucille Ball|accessdate=April 5, 2008|publisher=Everything2.com|quote=Ball and Rogers are lifelong friends}}&lt;/ref&gt; another Astaire-Rogers film. Ball and Ginger Rogers, who were distant maternal cousins, played aspiring actresses in the film ''[[Stage Door]]'' (1937).&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

In 1936, she landed the role she hoped would lead her to Broadway, in the [[Bartlett Cormack]] play ''[[Hey Diddle Diddle]]'', a comedy set in a [[Duplex (building)|duplex]] apartment in Hollywood. The play premiered in [[Princeton, New Jersey]], on January 21, 1937, with Ball playing the part of Julie Tucker, "one of three roommates coping with neurotic directors, confused executives, and grasping stars, who interfere with the girls' ability to get ahead".&lt;ref name="Brady2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brady|first=Kathleen|title=Lucille: The Life of Lucille Ball|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w82Ltm6taMAC&amp;pg=PA73|accessdate=December 26, 2012|year=2001|publisher=Random House Digital Inc.|isbn=978-0-8230-8913-0|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The play received good reviews, but problems existed, chiefly with its star, [[Conway Tearle]], who was in poor health. Cormack wanted to replace him, but the producer, [[Anne Nichols]], said the fault lay with the character and insisted that the part needed to be reshaped and rewritten. The two were unable to agree on a solution. The play was scheduled to open on Broadway at the [[Vanderbilt Theatre]], but closed after one week in [[Washington, DC]], when Tearle suddenly became gravely ill.{{sfn|Brady|2001|pp=73–74}}

Ball later auditioned for the role of [[Scarlett O'Hara]] for ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' (1939), but [[Vivien Leigh]] got the part, winning an [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] for her role.
Ball signed with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] in the 1940s, but never achieved major stardom there.&lt;ref name="isbn1550225901 "&gt;{{cite book|author=Crouse, Richard J.|title=The 100 Best Movies You've Never Seen|publisher=ECW Press|location=Toronto|year=2003|page=196|isbn=1-55022-590-1|quote="Stage Door" gives Ball her big break}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was known in many Hollywood circles as "Queen of the B's"{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}&amp;nbsp;– a title previously held by [[Fay Wray]]&amp;nbsp;– starring in a number of [[B movies (Hollywood Golden Age)|B-movies]], such as ''[[Five Came Back]]'' (1939). Like many budding actresses, Ball picked up radio work to supplement her income and gain exposure. In 1937, she appeared regularly on ''The [[Phil Baker (comedian)|Phil Baker]] Show''.

When its run ended in 1938, Ball joined the cast of ''The Wonder Show'' starring [[Jack Haley]] (best remembered as the [[Tin Woodman]] in ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', 1939). There began her 50-year professional relationship with the show's announcer, [[Gale Gordon]]. ''The Wonder Show'' lasted one season, with the final episode airing on April 7, 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lucyfan.com/wondershow.html|title="The Wonder Show"&amp;nbsp;– 1938 Radio Series&amp;nbsp;– Starring Jack Haley, with Lucille Ball &amp; Gale Gordon|accessdate=April 9, 2008|publisher=The Wonder Show|quote=Lucy and The Wonder Show}}&lt;/ref&gt; MGM producer [[Arthur Freed]] purchased the Broadway hit musical play ''[[DuBarry Was a Lady (film)|DuBarry Was a Lady]]'' (1943) especially for [[Ann Sothern]], but when she turned down the part, that plum role went to Ball, Sothern's real-life best friend. In 1946, Ball starred in ''[[Lover Come Back (1946 film)|Lover Come Back]]''. In 1947, she appeared in the murder mystery ''[[Lured]]'' as Sandra Carpenter, a [[Taxi dancer]] in London.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

===''I Love Lucy'' and Desilu===

[[File:Lucille Ball John Wayne 1955.JPG|thumb|right|With [[John Wayne]] in ''I Love Lucy'', 1955]]
In 1948, Ball was cast as Liz Cugat (later "Cooper"), a wacky wife, in ''[[My Favorite Husband]]'', an audio program for [[CBS Radio]].&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

The show was successful, and CBS asked her to develop it for television. She agreed, but insisted on working with her real-life husband, Cuban bandleader [[Desi Arnaz]]. CBS executives were reluctant, thinking the public would not accept an All-American redhead and a Cuban as a couple. CBS was initially unimpressed with the pilot episode, produced by the couple's [[Desilu Productions]] company. The pair went on the road with a [[vaudeville]] act, in which Lucy played the zany housewife, wanting to get into Arnaz's show. Given the great success of the tour, CBS put ''I Love Lucy'' into their lineup.&lt;ref name="title=Sotomayor: More 'Splainin' to Do"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/allison-silver/sotomayer-more-splainin-t_b_236347.html|title=Sotomayor: More 'Splainin' to Do|accessdate=June 18, 2010|publisher=The Huffington Post|quote=CBS executives originally did not want Ball, a sassy redhead, married to a Latino on the program|first=Allison|last=Silver|date=July 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''I Love Lucy'' was not only a star vehicle for Lucille Ball, but also a potential means for her to salvage her marriage to Arnaz. Their relationship had become badly strained, in part because of their hectic performing schedules, which often kept them apart, but mostly due to Desi's attraction to other women.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Along the way, Ball created a television dynasty and achieved several firsts. She was the first woman to head a TV production company: Desilu, which she had formed with Arnaz. After their divorce, she bought out his share and became a very actively engaged studio head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/previews/american_masters_lucy|title=American Masters "Lucille Ball: Finding Lucy"|accessdate=April 2, 2008|publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]|quote=Ball first woman to head a major studio}}&lt;/ref&gt; Desilu and ''I Love Lucy'' pioneered a number of methods still in use in TV production today, such as filming before a [[live studio audience]] with a number of cameras, and distinct [[Stage set|sets]], adjacent to each other.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; During this time, Ball taught a 32-week [[comedy workshop]] at the [[Brandeis-Bardin Institute]]. She was quoted as saying, "You cannot teach someone comedy; either they have it or they don't."{{sfn|Karol|2004|p=201}}

During the run of ''I Love Lucy'', Ball and Arnaz wanted to remain in their Los Angeles home, but [[Time zones in the U.S.|time-zone]] logistics made that impossible. Since prime time in L.A. was too late at night on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] to air a major network series, filming in California would have meant giving most of the TV audience an inferior [[kinescope]] picture — and, at least, a day later.&lt;ref name="titleI Love Lucy Turns 50 - Lucille Ball, Desi Arnaz, background info on influential, groundbreaking TV comedy|USA Today (Society for the Advancement of Education)|Find Articles at BNET.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1272/is_2676_130/ai_78256901 |title="I Love Lucy" Turns 50&amp;nbsp;– Lucille Ball, Desi Arnaz, background info on influential, groundbreaking TV comedy|publisher=USA Today (Society for the Advancement of Education)|accessdate=April 5, 2008|quote=Arnaz did not want kinescope|first=Wes|last=Gehring|year=2001|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080626011156/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1272/is_2676_130/ai_78256901|archivedate=June 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sponsor [[Philip Morris USA|Philip Morris]] did not want to show day-old [[kinescope]]s to major East Coast markets, nor did they want to pay the extra cost that filming, processing, and editing would require. So, the company pressured Ball and Arnaz to relocate to New York City. The couple offered to take a pay cut to finance filming, on the condition that Desilu would retain the rights of each episode once it aired. CBS agreed to relinquish the post-first-broadcast rights to Desilu, not realizing they were giving up a valuable and enduring asset. In 1957, CBS bought back the rights for $1,000,000 (${{Formatprice|{{inflation|US|1000000|1957}}}} in today's terms), providing Ball and Arnaz's down payment for the purchase of the former [[RKO Pictures]] studios, which they turned into Desilu Studios.&lt;ref&gt;Cushman, Marc; ''These Are the Voyages, Vol. 1''; Jacobs/Brown Press; San Diego, CA, USA; 2013; p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

''I Love Lucy'' dominated U.S. ratings for most of its run. (An attempt was also made, with the same cast and writers, to adapt the show for radio. The pilot adapted the famous "Breaking the Lease" episode, in which the Ricardos and Mertzes argue, and the Ricardos threaten to move, but find themselves stuck in a firm lease. The resulting radio audition disc has survived, but never aired.)&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/download/Singles_And_Doubles_Singles_H-K/52-02-26_xxx_I_Love_Lucy_-_Breaking_The_Lease.mp3](mp3) – archive.org&lt;/ref&gt;

A scene in which Lucy and Ricky practice the [[Tango (dance)|tango]], in the episode "Lucy Does The Tango", evoked the longest recorded studio audience laugh in the history of the show — so long that the sound editor had to cut that section of the soundtrack in half.&lt;ref name="isbn0-8230-8456-6"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hofstede, David|title=5000 Episodes and No Commercials: The Ultimate Guide to TV Shows on DVD 2007|publisher=Back Stage Books|location=New York|year=2006|page=149|isbn=0-8230-8456-6|quote=Longest laugh in television history&lt;!--|accessdate=December 8, 2014 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the show's production breaks, Lucy and Desi starred together in two feature films: ''[[The Long, Long Trailer]]'' (1954) and ''[[Forever, Darling]]'' (1956). After ''I Love Lucy'' ended its run in 1957, the main cast continued to appear in occasional hour-long specials under the title ''[[The Lucy–Desi Comedy Hour]]'' until 1960.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Desilu produced several other popular shows, such as ''[[The Untouchables (1959 TV series)|The Untouchables]]'', ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'', and ''[[Mission: Impossible]]''. The studio was eventually sold in 1967 for $17,000,000 (${{Formatprice|{{inflation|US|17000000|1967}}}} in today's terms) and merged into [[Paramount Pictures]].&lt;ref&gt;Cushman, Marc; ''These Are the Voyages, Vol. 2''; Jacobs/Brown Press; San Diego, CA, USA; 2014; p. 307&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities 1960-1977==
The 1960 Broadway musical ''Wildcat'' ended its run early when Ball became too ill {{clarify|date=January 2018}} to continue in the show.{{sfn|Kanfer|2003|p=220}} The show was the source of the song she made famous, "Hey, Look Me Over", which she performed with [[Paula Stewart]] on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]''. Ball hosted a CBS Radio talk show entitled ''Let's Talk to Lucy'' in 1964–65. She also made a few more movies including ''[[Yours, Mine and Ours (1968 film)|Yours, Mine, and Ours]]'' (1968), and the musical ''[[Mame (film)|Mame]]'' (1974), and two more successful long-running sitcoms for CBS: ''[[The Lucy Show]]'' (1962–68), which costarred Vivian Vance and Gale Gordon, and ''[[Here's Lucy]]'' (1968–74), which also featured Gordon, as well as Lucy's real-life children, Lucie Arnaz and Desi Arnaz, Jr. She appeared on the [[Dick Cavett]] show in 1974 and spoke of her history and life with Arnaz.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}
 
Ball's close friends in the business included perennial co-star [[Vivian Vance]] and film stars [[Judy Garland]], [[Ann Sothern]], and [[Ginger Rogers]], and comedic television performers [[Jack Benny]], [[Barbara Pepper]], [[Mary Wickes]] and [[Mary Jane Croft]]; all except Garland appeared at least once on her various series. Former Broadway co-stars [[Keith Andes]] and [[Paula Stewart]] also appeared at least once on her later sitcoms, as did [[Joan Blondell]], [[Rich Little]] and [[Ann-Margret]]. Ball mentored actress and singer [[Carole Cook]], and befriended [[Barbara Eden]], when Eden appeared on an episode of ''I Love Lucy''.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

In 1966, Ball became a friend and mentor to [[Carol Burnett]]. After having guested on Burnett's highly successful CBS-TV special ''[[Carol + 2]]'' and having the younger performer reciprocate by appearing on ''The Lucy Show,'' Ball reportedly offered Burnett her own sitcom called ''Here's Agnes'', to be produced by Desilu Productions. Burnett declined the offer, not wanting to commit herself to a weekly series. The two remained close friends until Ball's death in 1989. Ball sent flowers every year on Burnett's birthday. When Burnett awoke on the day of her 56th birthday in 1989, she discovered via the morning news that Lucille Ball had died. Later that afternoon, flowers arrived at Burnett's house with a note reading, "Happy Birthday, Kid. Love, Lucy."&lt;ref name="MitchellFink"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fink|first=Mitchell|title=The Last Days of Dead Celebrities|year=2007|publisher=[[Miramax Books]]|location=[[New York City]]|isbn=978-1401360252}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ball was originally considered by [[Frank Sinatra]] for the role of Mrs. Iselin in the Cold War thriller ''[[The Manchurian Candidate (1962 film)|The Manchurian Candidate]]''. Director/producer [[John Frankenheimer]], however, had worked with [[Angela Lansbury]] in a mother role in ''[[All Fall Down (film)|All Fall Down]]'' and insisted on having her for the part.&lt;ref&gt;Frankenheimer's DVD audio commentary.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ball was the lead actress in a number of comedy television specials to about 1980, including ''Lucy Calls the President'' which featured Vivian Vance, Gale Gordon and Mary Jane Croft, and ''Lucy Moves to NBC'', a special depicting a fictionalization of her move to the [[NBC]] television network.

== 1980s ==
During the mid-1980s, Ball attempted to resurrect her television career. In 1982, she hosted a two-part ''[[Three's Company]]'' [[retrospective]], showing [[film clips|clips]] from the show's first five seasons, summarizing memorable plotlines, and commenting on her love of the show.&lt;ref name="titleTV Land March 2007 –To Be Continued Free Fridays; Threes Company 30th Anniversary – Sitcoms Online Message Boards"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sitcomsonline.com/boards/showthread.php?t=192779|title=TV Land March 2007 – To Be Continued Free Fridays; Three's Company 30th Anniversary&amp;nbsp;– Sitcoms Online Message Boards|accessdate=April 6, 2008|publisher=TV Land|quote=Ball hosts Three's Company reflective}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1985 dramatic made-for-TV film about an elderly homeless woman, ''[[Stone Pillow]]'', received mixed reviews. Her 1986 sitcom comeback ''[[Life with Lucy]]'', costarring her longtime [[Foil (literature)|foil]] Gale Gordon and co-produced by Ball, Gary Morton, and prolific producer/former actor [[Aaron Spelling]] was cancelled less than two months into its run by [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]].&lt;ref name="titleLife With Lucy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvparty.com/movlucy4.html |title=Life With Lucy |accessdate=April 6, 2008 |publisher= TV Party|quote="Life With Lucy" turns out to be a flop}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1988, Ball was named the Hasty Pudding Woman of the Year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://bostonlocaltv.org/catalog/V_Y58RYZJ8ISFLYLS|work=Ten O'Clock News, WGBH|title=Lucille Ball at Hasty Pudding|date=February 19, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1988, Ball was hospitalized after suffering a mild heart attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-06-01/local/me-3583_1_lucille-ball|work=Los Angeles Times|title=Local News in Brief: Lucille Ball Recovering|date=June 1, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her last public appearance, just one month before her death, was at the 1989 [[Academy Awards]] telecast in which she and fellow presenter [[Bob Hope]] were given a standing ovation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Lucy A to Z: The Lucille Ball Encyclopedia|last=Karol|first=Michael|publisher=iUniverse|year=2004|isbn=0-595-29761-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Testimony before the House Committee on Un-American Activities==
When Ball registered to vote in 1936, she listed her party affiliation as Communist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=1936 |title=Index to Register of Voters|url=http://blogs.ancestry.com/ancestry/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/bal-lucy-actress-cst-1936-la-co-highlight.jpg|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707140727/http://blogs.ancestry.com/ancestry/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/bal-lucy-actress-cst-1936-la-co-highlight.jpg|dead-url=yes|archive-date=July 7, 2011|work=Ancestry.com|accessdate=March 14, 2012|postscript=Copy of document from Los Angeles City Precinct No. 1598, Los Angeles County, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; (She was registered as a Communist in 1938 as well.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ancestry.com|title=New California Voter Registrations Reveal Celebrity Party Lines|url=http://blogs.ancestry.com/ancestry/2008/01/30/new-california-voter-registrations-reveal-celebrity-party-lines|work=Ancestry.com|date=January 30, 2008|accessdate=March 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To sponsor the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]]'s 1936 candidate for the [[California State Assembly]]'s [[California's 57th State Assembly district|57th District]], Ball signed a certificate stating, "I am registered as affiliated with the Communist Party."&lt;ref&gt;Testimony of Lucille Désirée Ball Arnaz, September 4, 1953, Committee on Un-American Activities, House of Representatives, 83d Cong., 1st sess., [https://books.google.com/books?id=y1pXKrPW0DoC Investigation of Communist Activities in the Los Angeles Area&amp;nbsp;– Part 7], September 4, 1953 (Washington: United States Government Printing Office, 1953), p. 2567 (PDF p. 14)&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, she was appointed to the State [[Central Committee]] of the Communist Party of California, according to records of the [[California Secretary of State]]. In 1937, Hollywood writer [[Rena Vale]], a self-identified former Communist, attended a Communist Party new members' class at Ball's home, according to Vale's testimony before the [[United States House of Representatives]]' Special [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC), on July 22, 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|FBI file|pp=10–13}}: FBI memorandum: D.M. Ladd to Hoover, Subject: Lucille Ball, [[Desi Arnaz|Dezi [sic] Arnaz]], September 17, 1953.&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, Vale affirmed this testimony in a sworn deposition:{{quote|Within a few days after my third application to join the Communist Party was made, I received a notice to attend a meeting on North Ogden Drive, Hollywood; although it was a typed, unsigned note, merely requesting my presence at the address at 8 o'clock in the evening on a given day, I knew it was the long-awaited notice to attend Communist Party new members classes ... on arrival at this address I found several others present; an elderly man informed us that we were the guests of the screen actress, Lucille Ball, and showed us various pictures, books, and other objects to establish that fact, and stated she was glad to loan her home for a Communist Party new members class.|Affidavit of Rena M. Vale, November 23, 1942. Joint Fact-Finding Committee on Un-American Activities in California.}}

In a 1944 [[British Pathé]] newsreel, titled ''Fund Raising for Roosevelt'', Ball was featured prominently among several stage and film stars at events in support of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s fundraising campaign for the [[March of Dimes]].&lt;ref name="pathe"&gt;{{cite video|title=Fundraising for Roosevelt|medium=video newsreel film|url=http://www.britishpathe.com/record.php?id=55256|publisher=British Pathé|location=Washington, DC| accessdate=June 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She stated that in the [[1952 US Presidential Election]], she voted for [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Dwight Eisenhower]].

On September 4, 1953, Ball met privately with HUAC investigator William A. Wheeler in Hollywood and gave him sealed testimony. She stated that she had registered to vote as a Communist "or intended to vote the Communist Party ticket" in 1936 at her socialist grandfather's insistence.&lt;ref&gt;Ball explained, "In those days, that was not a big, terrible thing to do. It was almost as terrible to be a Republican in those days."

Immediately before the filming of episode 68 ("The Girls Go Into Business") of ''I Love Lucy'', Desi Arnaz, instead of his usual audience warm-up, told the audience about Lucy and her grandfather. Reusing the line he had first given to [[Hedda Hopper]] in an interview, he quipped: "The only thing red about Lucy is her hair, and even that is not legitimate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brioux|first=Bill|title=Truth and Rumors: The Reality Behind Tv's Most Famous Myths|year=2007|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Company|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=voIe7XkFvEsC&amp;pg=PA37#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=July 4, 2012|page=37|isbn=9780275992477}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
===Marriage, children, and divorce===
In 1940, Ball met Cuban-born bandleader Desi Arnaz while filming the [[Rodgers and Hart]] stage hit ''[[Too Many Girls (musical)|Too Many Girls]]''. When they met again on the second day, the two connected immediately and eloped the same year. Although Arnaz was drafted into the [[United States Army|Army]] in 1942, he ended up being classified for limited service due to a knee injury.&lt;ref name="TCM"&gt;{{cite web| title=Arnaz, Desi | url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/person/5686%7C37992/Desi-Arnaz/biography.html | publisher=tcm.com| date=| accessdate=July 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Arnaz stayed in Los Angeles, organizing and performing [[USO]] shows for wounded [[G.I. (military)|GIs]] being brought back from the Pacific.

Ball filed for divorce in 1944, going so far as obtaining an [[interlocutory decree]]; however, she and Arnaz reconciled, which precluded the entry of a final decree.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

On July 17, 1951, one month before her 40th birthday, Ball gave birth to daughter [[Lucie Arnaz|Lucie Désirée Arnaz]].&lt;ref name="Lucie"/&gt; A year and a half later, Ball gave birth to her second child, [[Desi Arnaz, Jr.|Desiderio Alberto Arnaz IV]], known as Desi Arnaz, Jr.&lt;ref name="twoop-bio"/&gt; Before he was born, ''I Love Lucy'' was a solid ratings hit, and Ball and Arnaz wrote the pregnancy into the show. (Ball's necessary and planned [[caesarean section]] in real life was scheduled for the same date that her television character gave birth.)&lt;ref name="twoop-bio"/&gt;

Several demands were made by CBS, insisting that a pregnant woman could not be shown on television, nor could the word "pregnant" be spoken on-air. After approval from several religious figures&lt;ref name="Memo"&gt;{{cite news|title=Radio: Birth of a Memo|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,817789,00.html|date=January 26, 1953|work=Time|accessdate=June 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the network allowed the pregnancy storyline, but insisted that the word "expecting" be used instead of "pregnant". (Arnaz garnered laughs when he deliberately mispronounced it as "'spectin'".)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Celebrity Commercials in TV's Golden Age|url=http://www.teletronic.co.uk/ustvads.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819094937/http://www.teletronic.co.uk/ustvads.htm|archivedate=August 19, 2010|work=Teletronic|accessdate=April 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The episode's official title was "Lucy Is Enceinte", borrowing the French word for pregnant;&lt;ref name="Cavett"/&gt; however, episode titles never appeared on the show.

The episode aired on the evening of January 19, 1953, with 44 million viewers watching Lucy Ricardo welcome little Ricky, while in real life Ball delivered her second child, Desi Jr., that same day in Los Angeles.  The birth made the cover of the first issue of ''[[TV Guide]]'' for the week of April 3–9, 1953.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

In October 1956, Ball, Arnaz, Vance, and [[William Frawley]] all appeared on a Bob Hope special on [[NBC]], including a spoof of ''I Love Lucy'', the only time all four stars were together on a color [[Broadcasting|telecast]]. By the end of the 1950s, Desilu had become a large company, causing a good deal of stress for both Ball and Arnaz.{{citation needed|date=March 2015|reason=Previous ref &lt;!--http://members.tripod.com/TropicanaNightclub/desihistory.html--&gt; not a reliable source}}

On March 3, 1960, a day after Desi's 43rd birthday (and one day after the filming of Lucy and Desi's last episode together), Ball filed papers in Santa Monica Superior Court, claiming married life with Desi was "a nightmare" and nothing at all as it appeared on ''I Love Lucy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Andrews|first=Bart`|title=Lucy and Ricky and Fred and Ethel|year=1976|publisher=Clarke, Irwin &amp; Company Limited|location=Toronto and Vancouver|page=166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 4, 1960, just two months after filming that episode (the final episode of ''The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour''), the couple divorced. Until his death in 1986, however, Arnaz and Ball remained friends and often spoke very fondly of each other. Her real-life divorce indirectly found its way into her later television series, as she was always cast as an unmarried woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.powells.com/review/2003_09_25.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031003164359/http://www.powells.com/review/2003_09_25.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=October 3, 2003|title=Powell's Books&amp;nbsp;– Review-a-Day&amp;nbsp;– Ball of Fire: The Tumultuous Life and Comic Art of Lucille Ball by Stefan Kanfer|work=The New Republic Online|accessdate=April 5, 2008|quote=Ball's real life divorce makes it into her new shows ... showing her as a single woman}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kanfer|2003|pp=72–84}}. "Ball and Arnaz remain friends".&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, Ball starred in the Broadway musical ''[[Wildcat (musical)|Wildcat]]'', which co-starred [[Keith Andes]] and [[Paula Stewart]]. It marked the beginning of a 30-year friendship between Lucy and Stewart, who introduced Lucy to second husband, Gary Morton, a [[Borscht Belt]] comic who was 13 years her junior.{{sfn|Sanders|Gilbert|1993|p=216}} According to Ball, Morton claimed he had never seen an episode of ''I Love Lucy'' due to his hectic work schedule. Ball immediately installed Morton in her production company, teaching him the television business and eventually promoting him to producer. Morton played occasional bit parts on Ball's various series.{{sfn|Kanfer|2003|pp=94, 103}}

Ball was outspoken against the relationship her son had with actress [[Patty Duke]]. Later, commenting on when her son dated [[Liza Minnelli]], she was quoted as saying, "I miss Liza, but you cannot domesticate Liza."{{sfn|Kanfer|2003|pp=35–37}}

==Illness and death==
On April 18, 1989, Ball was at her home in Beverly Hills when she complained of chest pains. An ambulance was called and she was rushed to the emergency room of [[Cedars-Sinai Medical Center]]. She was diagnosed with [[dissecting aortic aneurysm]] and underwent [[heart surgery]] for nearly eight hours, including the transplant of a new aorta. The surgery appeared to have been successful, and Ball began recovering very quickly, even walking around her room with little assistance. She received a flurry of get-well wishes from Hollywood, and across the street from Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, the [[Hard Rock Café]] erected a sign reading "Hard Rock Loves Lucy". However, shortly after dawn on April 26, Ball awoke with severe back pains and soon lost consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1187461.html|title=Article: Lucille Ball, Pioneer of Television Comedy, Dies at 77|accessdate=August 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ball Dies of Aorta Failure"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ball|first=Lucille|title=Ball dies of ruptured aorta|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-04-27/news/mn-1618_1_love-lucy-aorta-emergency-heart-surgery|publisher=L.A.

Attempts to revive her proved unsuccessful and she died at 5:47&amp;nbsp;a.m. [[Pacific Daylight Time|PDT]]. Doctors determined that Ball had succumbed to an [[abdominal aortic aneurysm]] and subsequent rupture, and that it was not directly related to her upper aneurysm and surgery the previous week. Cigarette smokers are known to have increased risk of abdominal aneurysm. Ball had been a heavy smoker most of her life. She was 77 years old.&lt;ref name="Lucille Ball dies"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ball|first=Lucille|title=Lucy dies|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1989-04-27/news/8904070889_1_love-lucy-lucy-ricardo-fred-mertz|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|accessdate=May 12, 2013|date=April 27, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Greenhalgh RM, Powell JT 2008 494–501"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Greenhalgh RM, Powell JT | title = Endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm | journal = N.

Her body was cremated and the ashes were initially interred in [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills)|Forest Lawn&amp;nbsp;– Hollywood Hills Cemetery]] in Los Angeles. However, in 2002, her children moved her remains to the Hunt family plot at Lake View Cemetery in Jamestown, New York, where her parents, Henry and Desirée (Hunt) Ball, and her grandparents are buried.&lt;ref name="Ball's Ashes Make it to Hometown Cemetery"/&gt;

==Recognition and legacy==
[[File:Jamestown, New York (4303088285).jpg|thumb|The Lucille Ball Little Theatre in Ball's hometown of Jamestown, New York]]

On August 6, 2011, which would have been her 100th birthday, [[Google]] honored Ball with an interactive [[Google Doodle|doodle]] on their homepage, which displayed six classic moments from ''I Love Lucy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Nancy Blair|title=Google Doodle pays charming tribute to Lucille Ball on her 100th|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/technologylive/post/2011/08/google-doodle-pays-charming-tribute-to-lucille-ball-on-her-100th/1|work=USA Today|date=August 6, 2011|accessdate=August 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day, a total of 915 Ball look-alikes converged on Jamestown to celebrate the birthday and set a new world record for such a gathering.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upi.com/Odd_News/2011/08/08/915-Lucille-Ball-look-alikes-set-record/UPI-55111312786834 "915 Lucille Ball look-alikes set record"], upi.com; accessed December 8, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2009, a [[Lucille Ball (sculpture)|statue of Ball]] has been on display in Celoron, New York. Residents deemed that statue "scary" and not accurate, earning it the nickname "Scary Lucy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hunter|first=Marnie|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/04/07/travel/artist-offers-to-fix-lucille-ball-statue-feat/|title=Mayor rejects artist's offer to fix 'Scary Lucy' statue|work=[[CNN]]|date=April 7, 2015|accessdate=April 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On August 1, 2016, it was announced that a new statue of Ball would replace it.

In 2015, it was announced that Ball would be played by [[Cate Blanchett]] in an untitled biographical film, to be written by [[Aaron Sorkin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/cate-blanchett-lucille-ball-biopic-aaron-sorkin-1201584182/|title=Cate Blanchett to star in Lucille Ball biopic from Aaron Sorkin|last=McNary|first=Dave|date=September 2, 2015|work=Variety|accessdate=September 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ball was portrayed by [[Gillian Anderson]], as her character [[Lucy Ricardo]], in the ''[[American Gods (TV series)|American Gods]]'' episode "The Secret of Spoons" (2017).&lt;ref&gt;[http://ew.com/tv/2017/05/07/american-gods-gillian-anderson-lucille-ball "Gillian Anderson dishes on her Lucille Ball moment"], ''Entertainment Weekly'', May 7, 2017; retrieved July 30, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ball was portrayed by [[Sarah Drew]] in ''I Love Lucy: A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Sitcom'', a comedy about how Ball and her husband battled to get their sitcom on the air. It had its world premiere in Los Angeles on July 12, 2018, co-starring [[Oscar Nuñez]] as [[Desi Arnaz]], and [[Seamus Dever]] as ''I Love Lucy'' creator-producer-head writer [[Jess Oppenheimer]]. The play, written by Jess Oppenheimer's son, Gregg Oppenheimer, was recorded in front of a live audience for nationwide public radio broadcast and online distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/los-angeles/regional/I-Love-LucyA-Funny-Thing-Happened-on-the-Way-to-the-Sitcom-255669|title=I Love Lucy: A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Sitcom|work=Broadway World|accessdate=July 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
