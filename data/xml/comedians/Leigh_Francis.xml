'''Leigh Francis''' (born 30 April 1973) is an [[England|English]] stand-up comedian, actor, director, producer, writer, voice artist and former [[caricaturist]], best known for creating [[Channel 4]]'s ''[[Bo' Selecta!]]'' and portraying [[Keith Lemon]] in several [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] and [[ITV2]] shows including ''[[Celebrity Juice]]'', ''[[Keith Lemon's LemonAid]]'', ''[[Through the Keyhole]]'' and ''[[The Keith Lemon Sketch Show]]''.

==Early life==
Francis was born in [[Beeston, Leeds]], [[West Riding of Yorkshire]], on 30 April 1973&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/3159968/keith-lemon-real-name-leigh-francis-celebrity-juice-jill-carter-wife/|title=All you need to know about TV personality Keith Lemon...|date=26 May 2018|work=The Sun|access-date=27 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=May 2018|reason=from Leeds and age 44, but no mention of Beeston and no birth date given}} and brought up on a [[council house|council estate]] in [[Old Farnley]], [[Leeds]]. His father died aged 47 of [[cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/3645046/We-grin-and-he-bears-it.html We grin and he bears it]. Telegraph.co.uk. (12 July 2005). Retrieved on 25 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Francis attended Farnley Park High School (now [[The Farnley Academy]]). He later studied at the [[Leeds College of Art]] and received a qualification in graphic design. Before making his major television breakthrough, he was discovered and encouraged by television presenter [[Davina McCall]], performing in-role stand-up comedy in a southern comedy club.

McCall landed Francis his first television role on ''Dom and Kirk's Nite O' Plenty'', where he portrayed Bobby Stark, a man who gives tips on how to win over the ladies. The series aired on [[Comedy Central (UK and Ireland)|Paramount Television]] from January to July 1996. Francis' second television role was as Barry Gibson, a music [[Paparazzi|paparazzo]], featured on the early series of [[Channel 4]]'s ''[[Popworld]]''. Francis also starred as various characters, including Gibson, Keith Lemon and [[Avid Merrion]] in the series ''Whatever I Want'', which aired late night on ITV in 2000.

==Career==
In his early career, Francis did a series of shorts for [[Paramount Comedy]] called ''Stars in Their Houses''. Some of the shorts can be found on [[YouTube]].

His major television breakthrough occurred when Channel 4 offered him a £250,000 deal to produce a series based on his television characters, such as his previous roles as Bobby Stark and Barry Gibson, and in 2002, ''[[Bo' Selecta!]]'' was born. The series featured Francis portraying a series of celebrities by wearing face masks to impersonate them, as well as portraying the main, non-celebrity character, [[Avid Merrion]]. The programme lasted for five series, airing between 2002 and 2006, however, the last two series were only loosely based on the original three. Season 4 was subtitled ''[[List of Bo' Selecta! episodes#Series 4|A Bear's Tail]]'', and was based on another of his characters, ''[[List of Bo' Selecta! characters#The Bear|The Bear]]''. Season 5 returned to Avid Merrion and was called ''[[List of Bo' Selecta! episodes#Series Five|Bo! in the USA]]''.

Following the axing of ''Bo' Selecta!'', Francis took one of the series characters, Keith Lemon, and created a brand new show, ''[[Keith Lemon's Very Brilliant World Tour]]'', which aired on [[ITV2]] in April 2008. The show was a success, and subsequently, Francis created another new show featuring Lemon, ''[[Celebrity Juice]]'', which has aired 19 series to date. Lemon also co-hosted ''[[Sing If You Can]]'' with [[Stacey Solomon]], and, since 7 April 2012, he has hosted his new show ''[[Keith Lemon's LemonAid]]'' on ITV. In November 2011, it was revealed that Lemon would make his feature film debut in ''[[Keith Lemon: The Film]]'', with production starting later that month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://flickeringmyth.blogspot.com/2011/11/keith-lemon-coming-to-big-screen-for.html |title=Keith Lemon coming to the big screen for Keith Lemon: The Film |publisher=Flickering Myth |date=9 November 2011 |accessdate=3 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 31 August 2013, Francis has presented ITV panel show ''[[Through the Keyhole]]'' in character as [[Keith Lemon]]. Since 5 February 2015, he has appeared in the [[ITV2]] comedy show ''[[The Keith Lemon Sketch Show]]''.

==Personal life==
On 30 October 2002, at [[Allerton Castle]], [[North Yorkshire]], Francis married Jill Carter, a beauty therapist. In February 2009, their daughter, Matilda, was born.&lt;ref name="me"&gt;[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article6830408.ece Leigh Francis: 'I'm just not very good at being me']. Entertainment.timesonline.co.uk (26 April 2012). Retrieved 25 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The couple also have another daughter, Dolly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hellomagazine.com/celebrities/2018021646372/keith-lemon-wife-jill-carter/|title=Who is Keith Lemon's wife?

==Characterisation==
In interviews, Francis usually adopts one of his celebrity guises, being interviewed as Avid Merrion during ''Bo' Selecta!'''s run between 2002 and 2006, and as Keith Lemon ever since. In an out-of-character interview with ''On: Yorkshire Magazine'', Francis confirmed Avid Merrion's accent and dialects were inspired by his former tutor at [[Leeds College of Art|Jacob Kramer College]], Laimonis Mieriņš. He also pointed out Merrion is a misspelling of Mieriņš, and has nothing to do with the [[Merrion Centre, Leeds|Merrion Centre]] in Leeds as some may have assumed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Leigh Francis Interview|url=http://www.on-magazine.co.uk/features/interviews/leigh-francis/|publisher=On: Yorkshire Magazine|accessdate=2 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Francis has also been interviewed as himself for ''[[The Frank Skinner Show]]'', ''[[Loose Women]]'', ''[[Big Brother's Little Brother]]'', [[The Museum of Curiosity]] and ''[[Friday Night with Jonathan Ross]]''.
