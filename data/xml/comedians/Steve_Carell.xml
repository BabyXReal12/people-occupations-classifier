== Career ==

=== Early work ===

While the program lasted only seven episodes, ''The Dana Carvey Show'' has since been credited with forging Carell's career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/10/arts/television/10itzk.html|title=Comedy Ahead of Its Time (if That Time Ever Comes)|last=Itzkoff|first=Dave|date=May 7, 2009|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=May 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He starred in a few short-lived television series, including ''Come to Papa'' and ''[[Over the Top (TV series)|Over the Top]]''.

=== ''The Office'' ===
{{Main article|Michael Scott (The Office)}}

In 2005, Carell signed a deal with [[NBC]] to star in ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]'', a remake of the British TV series [[The Office (UK TV series)|of the same name]]. In the series, a [[mockumentary]] about life at a mid-sized paper supply company, Carell played the role of [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]], the [[idiosyncratic]] regional manager of Dunder Mifflin, in [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]]. Although the first season of the adaptation suffered mediocre ratings, NBC renewed it for another season due to the anticipated success of Carell's film ''The 40-Year-Old Virgin'',&lt;ref name="ChicagoTribune"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/2006/02/office_workers_.html |title = 'Office' promotions pay off in a big way – The Watcher |newspaper = [[Chicago Tribune]] |date = February 23, 2006 |accessdate = August 9, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the series subsequently became a ratings success. Carell won a [[Golden Globe Award]] and [[TCA Awards|Television Critics Association Award]] during 2006 for his role in ''The Office''. He received six [[Primetime Emmy Award]] nominations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/steve-carell |title = Steve Carell Emmy Nominated |publisher = Emmys.com |accessdate = February 20, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for his work in the series (2006{{ndash}}2011). Carell earned approximately {{US$|175,000|link=yes}} per episode of the third season of ''The Office'', twice his salary for the previous two seasons. In an ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' interview, he commented on his salary, saying, "You don't want people to think you're a pampered jerk. Salaries can be ridiculous. On the other hand, a lot of people are making a lot of money off of these shows."&lt;ref name="EW"&gt;{{Cite news |last = Lynette |first = Rice |title = Deal or No Deal |newspaper = Entertainment Weekly |page = 34 |date = March 30, 2007 |postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carell was allowed "flex time" during filming to work on theatrical films. Carell worked on ''[[Evan Almighty]]'' during a production hiatus during the second season of ''The Office''.&lt;ref name="TV.com"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.tv.com/tracking/viewer.html?tid%3D93405%26ref_id%3D22343%26ref_type%3D101 |title = Archived copy |accessdate = November 9, 2006 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131103095031/http://www.tv.com/tracking/viewer.html?tid=93405&amp;ref_id=22343&amp;ref_type=101 |archivedate = November 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Production ended during the middle of the fourth season of ''The Office'' because of Carell's and others' refusal to cross the picket line of the [[2007 Writers Guild of America strike]]. Carell, a WGA member,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/television/news/e3i7ca2ef6b7899d1d4c7f297587fbd70ed |archive-url = https://archive.is/20130111005118/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/television/news/e3i7ca2ef6b7899d1d4c7f297587fbd70ed |dead-url = yes |archive-date = January 11, 2013 |title = WGA uses YouTube to state case |website= Hollywoodreporter.com |date = November 8, 2007 |accessdate = August 9, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has written two episodes of ''The Office'': "[[Casino Night]]" and "[[Survivor Man]]". Both episodes were praised, and Carell won a [[Writers Guild of America Award]] for "Casino Night".{{cn|date=January 2018}} On April 29, 2010, Carell stated he would be leaving the show when his contract expired at the conclusion of the 2010{{ndash}}2011 season because he wanted to focus on his film career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.cnn.com/video/#/video/showbiz/2010/04/29/anderson.the.buzz.thursday.cnn?hpt=T2 |work = CNN |title = CNN.com Video }}&lt;/ref&gt; His last episode as a main character, "[[Goodbye, Michael]]", aired April 28, 2011, with his final shot showing Carell walking to a Colorado-bound plane to join his [[fiancée]], [[Holly Flax]], in [[Boulder, Colorado]]. Although he was invited back for the series finale in 2013, Carell originally declined believing that it would go against his character's arc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://tvline.com/2013/01/24/the-office-series-finale-spoilers-steve-carell-not-returning/ |title = Steve Carell Formally Nixes Office Series Finale Comeback: 'It Didn't Make Sense' |work = Tv Line |author = Michael Ausiello |date = January 24, 2013 |accessdate = January 24, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately in the final version of the finale Carell reprised the role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://tvline.com/2013/05/06/steve-carell-the-office-series-finale/ |title = Exclusive: Steve Carell Back for The Office Finale |work = Tv Line |author = Michael Ausiello |date = May 6, 2013 |accessdate = May 9, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="age"&gt;{{cite web |last = Holloway |first = Diane |title = Steve Carell's 42, a 'Virgin' and the worst boss ever |work = [[Austin American-Statesman]] |date = August 16, 2005 |url = http://www.austin360.com/tv/content/movies/television/2005/08/16tvcolumn.html |accessdate = December 30, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070811043113/http://www.austin360.com/tv/content/movies/television/2005/08/16tvcolumn.html |archivedate = August 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Comedic roles (2004–2013)====
Carell's first major film role was as weatherman Brick Tamland in the 2004 hit comedy ''[[Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy]]''. Struck by Carell's performance in the film, ''Anchorman'' producer [[Judd Apatow]] approached Carell about creating a film together, and Carell told him about an idea he had involving a middle-aged man who is still a virgin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://movies.about.com/od/the40yearoldvirgin/a/40yearsc041505.htm |title = 40 Year Old Virgin – Steve Carell Interview |website = Movies.about.com |date = March 4, 2014 |accessdate = August 9, 2014 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131215060553/http://movies.about.com/od/the40yearoldvirgin/a/40yearsc041505.htm |archivedate = December 15, 2013 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The result was the 2005 film ''[[The 40-Year-Old Virgin]]'', which Carell and Apatow developed and wrote together, starring Carell as the title character. The film made $109&amp;nbsp;million in domestic box office sales{{cn|date=January 2018}} and established him as a leading man. It also earned Carell an [[MTV Movie Awards|MTV Movie Award]] for Best Comedic Performance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Movie Awards 2006 – MTV Movie Awards – MTV|url=http://www.mtv.com/movie-awards/2006|website=MTV.com|publisher=Viacom International Inc.|accessdate=May 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a WGA Award nomination, along with Apatow, for Best Original Screenplay.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

Carell played Uncle Arthur, imitating the [[Camp (style)|camp]] mannerisms of [[Paul Lynde]]'s original character, in ''[[Bewitched (2005 film)|Bewitched]]'', a TV adaptation co-starring [[Nicole Kidman]] and Will Ferrell.

His work in the films ''Anchorman'', ''The 40-Year-Old Virgin'', and ''Bewitched'' established Carell as a member of Hollywood's so-called "[[Frat Pack]]", a group of actors who often appear in films together, that also includes [[Owen Wilson]], [[Will Ferrell]], [[Vince Vaughn]], and [[Luke Wilson]]. Carell acted as the title character of ''[[Evan Almighty]]'', a sequel to ''[[Bruce Almighty]]'', reprising his role as Evan Baxter, now a U.S. Congressman. The film received mostly negative reviews. Carell starred in the 2007 film ''[[Dan in Real Life]]'', co-starring [[Dane Cook]] and [[Juliette Binoche]].
