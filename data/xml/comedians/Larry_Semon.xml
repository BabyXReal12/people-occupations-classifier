'''Lawrence "Larry" Semon''' (February 9, 1889&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.ancestry.com/Browse/view.aspx?dbid=6482&amp;path=New+York.Brooklyn+City.23.S.199&amp;fn=Lawrence&amp;ln=Semon&amp;st=r&amp;pid=1391363&amp;rc=&amp;zp=100 World War I Draft Registration Card] at ancestry.com : "Lawrence Semon, born Feb 9 1889 West Point, Mississippi, Motion Picture Director for Vitagraph Co, living in Brooklyn, New York, signed Lawrence Semon on 5 Jun 1917"&lt;/ref&gt; – October 8, 1928) was an [[United States|American]] actor, [[Film director|director]], [[Film producer|producer]], and [[screenwriter]] during the [[silent film]] era. In his day, Semon was considered a major movie comedian, but he is now remembered mainly for working with both [[Stan Laurel]] and [[Oliver Hardy]] before they started working together.

He is also sometimes noted for directing (as well as appearing in) the 1925 [[silent film]] ''[[Wizard of Oz (1925 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', which had a slight influence on the better-known 1939 [[Sound film|talkie]] ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' released by [[MGM]]. The film was included in the 2005 three-disc [[DVD]] version of the 1939 film, along with other silent ''Oz'' movies.

==Early life==
Born in [[West Point, Mississippi|West Point]], [[Mississippi]], Semon was the son of a [[vaudeville]] magician, Zera the Great, while his mother worked as his assistant. Along with his older sister, Semon joined his parents' act until his father's death.&lt;ref name=oldnew&gt;{{cite book|last=Cullen|first=Frank |author2=Hackman, Florence |author3=McNeilly, Donald |title=Vaudeville, Old &amp; New: An Encyclopedia of Variety Performers in America|publisher=Routledge|year=2007|pages=1006|isbn=0-415-93853-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his education in [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], Semon moved to [[New York City]], where he worked for ''[[The New York Sun]]'' and later ''The New York Morning Telegraph'' as a [[cartoonist]] and [[Graphic designer|graphic artist]]. While working as an artist, Semon appeared in monologues in vaudeville, where he attracted the attention of [[Vitagraph Studios]]. In 1915, he was offered a contract with the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lahue|first=Kalton C. |author2=Gill, Samuel |title=Clown Princes and Court Jesters. Some Great Comics of the Silent Screen|publisher=A. S. Barnes|year=1970|pages=332}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Louvish|first=Simon |title=Stan and Ollie: The Roots of Comedy : The Double Life of Laurel and Hardy|publisher=Macmillan|year=2001|pages=128|isbn=0-312-26651-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
After signing with [[Vitagraph]], Semon worked behind the scenes as a scenario writer, director, and film producer for actor [[Hughie Mack]]'s films. He occasionally cast himself in bit parts in the films he worked on. When Mack left Vitagraph, Semon began playing the lead roles.&lt;ref name=oldnew /&gt; He usually played a white-faced goof in [[Bowler hat|derby hat]] and [[overalls]] who would enter any given setting (a [[bakery]], a [[restaurant]], a [[construction site]], a [[internment|prison camp]], etc.) and cause chaos, with people being covered with debris and property being destroyed. His short [[slapstick]] comedies were made and released quickly and prolifically, making Semon very familiar to moviegoers.

As his fame grew, his films expanded from one reel (about 12 minutes) to two reels, and Semon was given a free hand in making them. This became a dangerous policy because Semon became notorious for being expensive and extravagant: his two-reel comedies could easily cost more than an average five-reel feature film. As a former [[cartoon]]ist, Semon staged similarly cartoony sight gags, using elaborate [[special effect]]s. No gag was too big for Semon. He loved chase sequences involving airplanes (sometimes using three in a film), exploding [[barn]]s, falling [[water towers]], auto wrecks and/or explosions, and liberal use of substances in which to douse people. A typical Semon comedy might involve barrels of flour, sacks of soot, gallons of ink, gobs of jam, or pits filled with mud. For example, in Semon's ''[[The Bell Hop]]'', a man sleeping under the spray of a malfunctioning fountain imagines he is swimming in the ocean, and in his sleep he dives off the bed, through the floor, and into a vat of paint in the lobby below. Oliver Hardy recalled in an interview that Semon, when staging his comedy short ''[[The Sawmill]]'' in a lumber camp, would not use traditional, painted stage sets. Instead, Semon insisted on building permanent log cabins complete with modern conveniences. The production budget soared, and his bosses at Vitagraph finally demanded that Semon become his own [[Film producer|producer]] and underwrite his productions personally.

Semon tried to reverse his financial problems by entering the more lucrative field of [[feature film]]s. He produced and starred in a few features in the mid '20s, but by 1927 he was back in short subjects released through [[Educational Pictures]]. After filing for [[bankruptcy]] in 1928, Semon returned to vaudeville. While traveling on the vaudeville circuit, he suffered a [[Mental breakdown|nervous breakdown]] and went back to Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=vaudeville&gt;{{cite book|last=Cullen|first=Frank |author2=Hackman, Florence |author3=McNeilly, Donald |title=Vaudeville, Old &amp; New: An Encyclopedia of Variety Performers in America|publisher=Routledge|year=2007|pages=1007|isbn=0-415-93853-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
After returning to [[Los Angeles]], Semon was sent to a [[sanatorium]] in [[Victorville, California]], where, on October 8, 1928, at the age of 39, he died of [[pneumonia]] and [[tuberculosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,732000,00.html|title=Milestones|date=1928-10-15|publisher=time.com|accessdate=2008-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nicknames==
French audiences knew him as '''Zigoto''', Italian ones as '''Ridolini''', and Spanish ones as '''Jaimito''' ("Jimmy") in pre-[[Spanish Civil War|war]] releases and '''Tomasín''' ("Tommy") in the 1940 rereleases by Manuel Rotellar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.claudia-sassen.net/Larrygallery/corrections/node6.html Claudia Sassen] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721072521/http://www.claudia-sassen.net/Larrygallery/corrections/node6.html |date=2011-07-21 }} quotes Juan Gabriel Tharrats.&lt;/ref&gt;
