'''William Ray''' "'''Bill'''" '''Engvall Jr.''' (born July 27, 1957)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/celebrities/engvall/bio/141977|title=Bill Engvall: Biography|publisher=TV Guide.com|accessdate=2011-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[United States of America|American]] comedian and [[actor]] best known for his work as a [[stand-up comedy|stand-up]] comic, his signature "Here's Your Sign" bit, and as a member of the [[Blue Collar Comedy Tour|Blue Collar Comedy]] group.

==Early life==
Bill Engvall was born in [[Galveston, Texas]]. Following graduation from [[Richardson High School]] in [[Richardson, Texas]], Engvall attended [[Southwestern University]] in [[Georgetown, Texas]], intending to earn a bachelor's degree and become a teacher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tbs.com/stories/story/0,,107945,00.html|title=The Bill Engvall Show bio|publisher=TBS.com|accessdate=2011-06-05|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106031333/http://www.tbs.com/stories/story/0%2C%2C107945%2C00.html|archivedate=2012-01-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While at Southwestern he was a member of Xi Chapter of the [[Kappa Alpha Order]]. Engvall left college without graduating and worked a series of jobs, including tour guide at [[Inner Space Caverns]], and disc jockey in a [[Dallas, Texas]] nightclub.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/engvall_bill/bio.jhtml|title=Bill Engvall biography|publisher=CMT.com|accessdate=2011-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was while working as club DJ he first ventured into standup comedy at amateur and open mic nights around Dallas.

==Career==
In 1990 Bill Engvall moved to southern [[California]] to dedicate full-time to his comedy. Early notoriety came from hosting the cable show ''A Pair of Jokers'' with [[Rosie O'Donnell]] and an appearance on ''[[The Golden Palace]]'' where he played Blanche's son Matthew, a stockbroker turned aspiring comic. Other early appearances included hosting [[A&amp;E Network]]s ''[[The Improv|An Evening at The Improv]]'' as well as stand-up routines on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson|The Tonight Show]]'' and the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/engvall_bill/bio.jhtml|title=Bill Engvall biography|publisher=CMT.com|accessdate=2011-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A career breakthrough happened in 1992 when Engvall was named Best Male Standup at the [[American Comedy Awards]]. He appeared as Matthew Devereaux, the son of [[Blanche Devereaux]] on an episode of ''[[The Golden Palace]]'' in 1993. His first role as a series regular came soon after when he was cast in the ABC series ''[[Delta (TV series)|Delta]]'', starring [[Delta Burke]]. However, the show only lasted one season and Engvall returned to making the rounds of comedy clubs and the occasional television appearance until 1996 when he was cast with fellow comic and best friend [[Jeff Foxworthy]] in the [[NBC]] version of ''[[The Jeff Foxworthy Show]]''. Signed by [[Warner Bros. Records]] in 1996, Engvall released the first of a series of highly successful comedy albums, ''[[Here's Your Sign]]'', based on his signature stage bit. The album was [[Music recording sales certification|certified Platinum]] and peaked at #5 on the Billboard Country album chart, thanks in part to the single and video of the same title on which he collaborated with country singer [[Travis Tritt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tbs.com/stories/story/0,,107945,00.html|title=The Bill Engvall Show bio|publisher=TBS.com|accessdate=2011-06-05|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106031333/http://www.tbs.com/stories/story/0%2C%2C107945%2C00.html|archivedate=2012-01-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 8 more comedy albums followed including ''[[Dorkfish]]'' in 1998, and the most recent, 2009's ''[[Aged and Confused]]''.

In 2011, he also attended the NASCAR After The Lap event in Las Vegas.

===Blue Collar Comedy Tour===
{{main article|Blue Collar Comedy Tour}}

In 2000, [[Jeff Foxworthy]] and Engvall launched the first of 6 [[Blue Collar Comedy Tour]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/270865/Blue-Collar-Comedy-Tour-The-Movie/overview New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt; The tours also featured [[Ron White]] and [[Larry the Cable Guy]] and were largely responsible for their breakout success. Each of the 6 years of the tour were very successful and spawned 3 films, a satellite radio show, and a television show titled ''[[Blue Collar TV]]'' on [[The WB Television Network|The WB Network]].

===Game show host===
On June 6, 2011, Engvall began a new chapter in his career as he took over as host of the re-launched ''[[Lingo (U.S. game show)|Lingo]]'' on [[Game Show Network|GSN]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://gameshows.about.com/b/2011/01/13/gsn-bringing-lingo-back-with-new-host.htm GSN Bringing Lingo Back with New Host]&lt;/ref&gt; According to an interview in ''American Profile'' magazine, Engvall said he jumped at the chance to host the show, citing the fun his friend Foxworthy had hosting ''[[Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?]]''. Engvall had been a fan of ''Lingo'' when it aired a few years previously before ending in 2007, admitting that his wife always beat him to the answers. When asked if there were any plans to have buddies Foxworthy or Larry The Cable Guy appear on ''Lingo'', he replied, "You never know! I would love to have them on the show because it would be a blast. I would really dig that."&lt;ref&gt;''American Profile'' newsmagazine. Article title: "Q&amp;A with Bill Engvall". June 5, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Dancing with the Stars''===
In 2013, Engvall was announced as a contestant on the [[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. season 17)|17th season]] of ''[[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. TV series)|Dancing with the Stars]]'' paired with professional dancer [[Emma Slater]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-207_162-57601254/dancing-with-the-stars-leah-remini-valerie-harper-snooki-among-new-cast/&lt;/ref&gt; In the first week, he danced the Foxtrot and received a score of 18. The second week was Latin week and he saw some higher scores from the judges receiving a 21 for his Jive. And the third week of competition, Bill saw his highest score of 24 with a Paso Doble to the Lone Ranger theme song. Throughout the rest of the show, the judges usually placed Engvall and Slater at the bottom of the leaderboard, but an enormous fan base kept them in the competition, resulting in higher-scoring contestants, e.g. [[Christina Milian]], [[Snooki]], [[Brant Daugherty]], [[Elizabeth Berkley]], and [[Leah Remini]] being voted out instead.

On November 18, Engvall and Slater made it to the finals, along with [[Amber Riley]], [[Jack Osbourne]] and [[Corbin Bleu]]. The two finished in 4th place.

==Personal life==
Bill and Gail Engvall (born August 5, 1960) have been married since December 18, 1982. They have a daughter named Emily (born 1986), a 2008 graduate from the [[University of Puget Sound]], as well as a son, Travis (born June 25, 1991), a 2015 graduate from [[Northern Arizona University]]; both of whom are often mentioned during his routines. Engvall resides in southern California when not on tour and maintains a blog for the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim]] on the website of Fox Sports West.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ww2.somdnews.com/stories/06252010/weektop112652_32198.shtml An interview with Bill Engvall: blogging, acting, a new outlook.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425063820/http://ww2.somdnews.com/stories/06252010/weektop112652_32198.shtml |date=April 25, 2012 }} SoMdNews.com.
