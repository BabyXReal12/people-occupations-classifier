'''Charles Sherman Ruggles''' (February 8, 1886 – December 23, 1970) was a comic American [[character actor]]. In a career spanning six decades, Ruggles appeared in close to 100 feature films, often in mild-mannered and comic roles.  He was also the elder brother of [[Film director|director]], producer, and silent film actor [[Wesley Ruggles]] (1889–1972).

==Career==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}
Ruggles was born in [[Los Angeles, California]] in 1886. Despite training to be a doctor, Ruggles soon found himself on the stage, appearing in a stock production of ''Nathan Hale'' in 1905. At Los Angeles's [[Majestic Theatre (South Broadway, Los Angeles)|Majestic Theatre]], he played Private Jo Files in [[L. Frank Baum]] and [[Louis F. Gottschalk]]'s musical ''[[The Tik-Tok Man of Oz]]'' in 1913.

He moved to Broadway to appear in ''[[Help Wanted (1915 film)|Help Wanted]]'' in 1914. His first screen role came in the silent ''[[Peer Gynt]]'' the following year. Throughout the 1910s and 1920s, Ruggles continued to appear in silent movies, though his passion remained the stage, appearing in long-running productions such as ''[[The Passing Show of 1918]]'', ''[[The Demi-Virgin]]'' and ''[[Battling Butler]]''. His most famous stage hit was ''[[Queen High]]'', one of his last before a 20-year hiatus, produced in 1926.

From 1929, Ruggles appeared in talking pictures. His first was ''[[Gentleman of the Press]]'' in which he played a comic, alcoholic newspaper reporter. Throughout the 1930s, he was teamed with comic actress [[Mary Boland]] in a string of domestic farces, notably ''[[If I Had a Million]]'', ''[[Six of a Kind]]'', ''[[Ruggles of Red Gap]]'', and ''[[People Will Talk (1935 film)|People Will Talk]]''. Ruggles is best remembered today as the big-game hunter in ''[[Bringing Up Baby]]'' and billionaire Michael J. 'Mike' O'Connor in ''[[It Happened on Fifth Avenue]]''.

In 1949, Ruggles halted his film career to return to the stage and to move into television. He was the headline character in the TV series ''[[The Ruggles]]'', a family comedy in which he played a character also called Charlie Ruggles, and ''[[The World of Mr. Sweeney]]''. He guest starred on ''[[The Martha Raye Show]]'' and portrayed a time-traveling librarian in "[[Man from 1997]]," a 1956 [[science fiction]] episode of the television series ''[[Conflict (TV series)|Conflict]]''. In 1961, Ruggles was cast in "Hassie's European Tour", in which he portrays a wealthy neighbor who offers to finance a European trip for series character Hassie McCoy ([[Lydia Reed]]) on ''[[The Real McCoys]]''.

Ruggles returned to the big screen in 1961, playing Charles McKendrick in ''[[The Parent Trap (1961 film)|The Parent Trap]]'' and Mackenzie Savage in ''[[The Pleasure of His Company]]''. In the latter film, he reprised the role for which he had won a [[Tony Award]] in 1959. In 1963 he memorably played the grandfather of silent star [[Corinne Griffith]] in ''[[Papa's Delicate Condition]]''. Griffith had written the book of her early life on which the film is based.

Ruggles had a recurring guest role on ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'' in the mid-1960s as Lowell Redlings Farquhar, father-in-law of [[Milburn Drysdale]] ([[Raymond Bailey]]). Ruggles also played Aunt Clara's ([[Marion Lorne]]) old flame, the warlock Hedley Partridge, as well as a Mr. Caldwell, whose company marketed soup, in the television series ''[[Bewitched]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Bewitched'', 'Help, Help, Don't Save Me' (ABC, 1964), script by [[Danny Arnold]] &amp; [[Sol Saks]]&lt;/ref&gt;

He played Congressman John Canfield on an episode of ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'' called "Aunt Bee, The Swinger", and appeared as a driving instructor on ''[[The Munsters]]''. Ruggles also lent his voice to the [[The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show#Supporting features|Aesop and Son]] features in [[Jay Ward|Jay Ward's]] ''[[The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show]]''.

==Personal life==
His marriage to [[Adele Rowland]] (1914–1916) ended in divorce after two years. He then married Marion LaBarba in 1942; the couple remained wed until his death in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|0749476}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marion died in 1978.

==Death==
Ruggles died of cancer at [[Saint John's Health Center]] in [[Santa Monica, California]] on December 23, 1970 at the age of 84.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Archives: Story|url=http://www.filmsofthegoldenage.com/articles/2008/04/29/current_issue/rugglescharles.txt|website=filmsofthegoldenage.com|accessdate = 2015-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Eugene Register-Guard - Google News Archive Search|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1310&amp;dat=19701223&amp;id=7KxVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=D-EDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5220,5206052&amp;hl=en|website=google.com|accessdate=2015-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
