'''William Melvin Hicks'''&lt;ref name=officialbio /&gt; (December 16, 1961 – February 26, 1994) was an American stand-up comedian, [[social criticism|social critic]], [[Satire|satirist]] and musician. His material, encompassing a wide range of social issues including religion, politics, and philosophy, was controversial, and often steeped in [[black comedy|dark comedy]].

At the age of 16, while still in high school, he began performing at the [[Comedy Workshop]] in [[Houston]], Texas. During the 1980s, he toured the United States extensively and made a number of high-profile television appearances; but it was in the UK that he amassed a significant fan base, filling large venues during his 1991 tour.&lt;ref name="biography"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.bestcomedyonline.net/comedian-biographies/bill-hicks-personal-life-career | title = Bill Hicks Personal Life and Career | publisher = Bestcomedyonline.net | accessdate = August 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also achieved a modicum of recognition as a guitarist and songwriter.

Hicks died of [[pancreatic cancer]] on February 26, 1994, in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], at the age of 32. In subsequent years his work gained a significant measure of acclaim in creative circles—particularly after a series of posthumous album releases—and he developed a substantial cult following. In 2007 he was voted sixth on Britain's [[Channel 4]] list of the 100 Greatest Stand-Up Comics,&lt;ref&gt;The 100 Greatest Stand-Ups 2007. [http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/100_greatest_stand_ups/episodes/1/1/ British Comedy Guide], retrieved February 2, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; and rose to number four on the 2010 list.&lt;ref&gt;The 100 Greatest Stand-Ups 2010. [http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/100_greatest_stand_ups/episodes/1/2/ British Comedy Guide], retrieved February 2, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine ranked him thirteenth on its list of the 50 best stand-up comics of all time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/lists/50-best-stand-up-comics-of-all-time-w464199 The 50 Best Stand-up Comics of All Time]. Rollingstone.com, retrieved February 15, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Hicks was born in [[Valdosta, Georgia]], the son of James Melvin "Jim" Hicks (1923–2006) and Mary Reese Hicks, the younger sibling of Lynn and Steve. The family lived in Florida, [[Alabama]], and [[New Jersey]] before settling in [[Houston]], Texas, when Bill was seven.&lt;ref name="Bill Hicks 2004"&gt;''Bill Hicks: Love All the People'' (Robinson Publishing, 2005), {{ISBN|978-1-84529-111-2}}, '''page #s?'''&lt;/ref&gt; He was drawn to comedy at an early age, emulating [[Woody Allen]] and [[Richard Pryor]], and writing routines with his friend Dwight Slade. At school he began performing comedy, mostly derivations of Woody Allen material, for his classmates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bill Hicks (Personal Life, Career)|url=http://www.bestcomedyonline.net/comedian-biographies/bill-hicks-personal-life-career?iframe=true&amp;width=95%&amp;height=95%|publisher=bestcomedyonline|accessdate=July 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At home, he would write his own one-liners and slide them under the bedroom door of his brother Steve, the only family member Bill respected, for his critical analysis. "Keep it up", Steve told him. "You're really good at this."&lt;ref&gt;True, C. ''American Scream: The Bill Hicks Story''. London, Sidgwick &amp; Jackson, 2002. {{ISBN|0380803771}}. p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early on, Hicks began to mock his family's [[Southern Baptist Convention|Southern Baptist]] religious beliefs. "We were Yuppie Baptists," he joked to the ''[[Houston Post]]'' in 1987. "We worried about things like, 'If you scratch your neighbor's Subaru, should you leave a note?'"&lt;ref&gt;True (2002), pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt; Biographer Cynthia True described a typical argument with his father: {{quote|The elder Hicks would say, "I believe that the Bible is the literal word of God." And Bill would counter, "No it's not, Dad." "Well, I believe that it is." "Well," Bill replied, "you know, some people believe that they're Napoleon. That's fine. Beliefs are neat. Cherish them, but don't share them like they're the truth."&lt;ref&gt;True (2002), p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Hicks did not, however, reject spiritual ideology itself, and throughout his life he sought various alternative methods of experiencing it. Kevin Slade, elder brother of Dwight, introduced him to [[Transcendental Meditation technique|Transcendental Meditation]] and other forms of spirituality. Over one [[Thanksgiving]] weekend he took Hicks and Dwight to a TM residence course in [[Galveston]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = True | first= Cynthia |year =2002 | title = American Scream: The Bill Hicks Story | publisher = [[HarperCollins|Harper Paperbacks]] |isbn = 0380803771 | page = [https://books.google.com/books?id=Qxa5uj95B84C&amp;pg=PA25&amp;dq=bill+hicks+transcendental+meditation&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QS8dUq_PG6iusATA1oHoBA&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=bill%20hicks%20transcendental%20meditation&amp;f=false 25]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Worried about his rebellious behavior, his parents took him to a [[psychoanalyst]] at age 17. According to Hicks, after the first group session the analyst took him aside and told him, "You can continue coming if you want to, but it's them, not you."&lt;ref name="Bill Hicks 2004" /&gt;

==Career==

===Beginnings===
Hicks was associated with the [[Texas Outlaw Comics]] group developed at the [[Comedy Workshop]] in Houston in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="wati1991"&gt;Staff report (April 18, 1991). 'Texas outlaw' fires from the lip. ''[[Washington Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matt Harlock and Paul Thomas, Directors (2009). ''[[American: The Bill Hicks Story]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===California and New York===
By January 1986, Hicks was using recreational drugs and his financial resources had dwindled.&lt;ref name=official&gt;{{cite web |url=http://billhicks.com/Bio.html |title=Bill Hicks |first=Paul |last=Outhwaite |publisher=Bill Hicks family official site |accessdate=2014-04-08 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6OgPQmr8H?url=http://billhicks.com/Bio.html |archivedate=April 8, 2014 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; However his career received another upturn in 1987, when he appeared on [[Rodney Dangerfield]]'s ''Young Comedians Special''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Arp|first1=Robert|title=The Devil and Philosophy: The Nature of His Game (Popular Culture and Philosophy #83)|date=2014|publisher=Open Court Pub Co|isbn=978-0812698541}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, he moved to New York City, and for the next five years performed about 300 times a year.&lt;ref name=officialbio&gt;{{cite web|last1=Outhwaite|first1=Paul|title=Bio|url=http://www.billhicks.com/bio.html|website=Arizona Bay Production Company, Inc.|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the album ''Relentless'', he jokes that he quit using drugs because "once you've been taken aboard a [[UFO]], it's kind of hard to top that", although in his performances, he continued to extol the virtues of [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]], [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]], and [[psilocybin mushroom|psychedelic mushrooms]].&lt;ref&gt;See ''Sane Man'' and ''Rant in E Minor''.&lt;/ref&gt;

He eventually fell back to [[chain smoking]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jason Ankeny |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/bill-hicks-mn0000077267/biography |title=Bill Hicks &amp;#124; Biography |publisher=AllMusic |accessdate=2014-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; a theme that would figure heavily in his performances from then on. His nicotine addiction, love of smoking, and occasional attempts to quit became a recurring theme in his act throughout his later years.

In 1988, Hicks signed on with his first professional business manager, Jack Mondrus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Strongman|first1=Phil|title=Bill Hicks: 25 years on from the cult comedian's big break • The Register|url=https://m.theregister.co.uk/2015/07/19/feature_comedy_bill_hicks/|website=The Register|publisher=Situation Publishing|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the track "Modern Bummer" of his 1990 album ''[[Dangerous (Bill Hicks album)|Dangerous]]'', Hicks says he quit drinking alcohol in 1988.

In 1989, he released his first video, ''Sane Man''; a remastered version with 30 minutes of extra footage was released in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/screens/2000-06-02/bill-hicks-sane-man/ |title=Bill Hicks ...

===Early fame===
[[File:Bill Hicks at the Laff Stop in Austin, Texas, 1991.jpg|thumb|upright|Bill Hicks at the [[Laff Stop]] in Austin, Texas, 1991]]
In 1990, Hicks released his first album, ''Dangerous'', performed on the [[HBO]] special ''One Night Stand,'' and performed at [[Montreal]]'s ''[[Just for Laughs]]'' festival.&lt;ref name=official /&gt; He was also part of a group of American stand-up comedians performing in London's West End in November. Hicks was a huge hit in the UK and Ireland and continued touring there throughout 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bill Hicks|url=http://www.icomedytv.com/Top-Comedians/ID/366/Bill-Hicks.aspx|publisher=icomedytv|accessdate=July 16, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703084554/http://www.icomedytv.com/Top-Comedians/ID/366/Bill-Hicks.aspx|archivedate=July 3, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year, he returned to ''Just for Laughs'' and filmed his second video, ''Relentless.''

Hicks made a brief detour into musical recording with the ''Marble Head Johnson'' album in 1992 collaborating with Houston high school friend [[Kevin Booth]] and Austin Texas drummer Pat Brown. During the same year he toured the UK, where he recorded the ''Revelations'' video&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billhicks.com/ |title=Flash Intro Page |publisher= Bill Hicks family official site |date=December 9, 2013 |accessdate=2013-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; for [[Channel 4]]. He closed the show with his soon-to become-famous philosophy regarding life, "It's Just a Ride." Also in that tour he recorded the stand-up performance released in its entirety on a double CD entitled, ''Salvation.'' Hicks was voted "Hot Standup Comic" by ''[[Rolling Stone|Rolling Stone magazine]]'' in 1993. He moved to Los Angeles in 1992.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

===Hicks and Tool===
[[Progressive metal]] band [[Tool (band)|Tool]] invited Hicks to open a number of concerts in its 1993 [[Lollapalooza]] appearances, where Hicks once asked the audience to look for a [[contact lens]] he had lost. Thousands of people complied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.fadetoblack.com/interviews/billhicks/13.html | title = It's Only a Ride: Bill Hicks Question &amp; Answer with Kevin Booth | publisher= FadeToBlack.com | author = Interview with Kevin Booth|accessdate = March 3, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050829101024/http://www.fadetoblack.com/interviews/billhicks/13.html |archivedate = August 29, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of Tool felt that they and Hicks "were resonating similar concepts".&lt;ref name="austinkeenanhicks"&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://toolshed.down.net/articles/index.php?action=view-article&amp;id=May_1997--The_Austin_Chronicle.html| title = Another Dead Hero
| first= Andy| last=Langer| work = The Austin Chronicle| date = May 1997| accessdate = May 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intending to raise awareness about Hicks's material and ideas, Tool dedicated their triple-platinum&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Theiner | first =Manny | title =Concert Review: Tool's prog pleases populace | work =Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |date=September 28, 2006 | url =http://www.post-gazette.com/frontpage/2006/09/28/Concert-Review-Tool-s-prog-pleases-populace/stories/200609280426 |quote =...from its triple-platinum 1996 release, "Ænima."}}&lt;/ref&gt; album ''[[Ænima]]'' (1996) to Hicks. Both the [[Lenticular printing|lenticular]] casing of the ''Ænima'' album packaging as well as the chorus of the title track "[[Ænema]]" make reference to a sketch from Hicks's ''[[Arizona Bay]]'' album, in which he contemplates the idea of Los Angeles falling into the Pacific Ocean. ''Ænima''{{'}}s final track, "[[Third Eye (song)|Third Eye]]" contains samples from Hicks's ''Dangerous'' and ''Relentless'' albums.&lt;ref name="austinkeenanhicks"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.ucdadvocate.com/home/index.cfm?event=displayArticle&amp;ustory_id=f13de017-3fd8-4f74-9abd-9f3f54482961

An alternate version of the ''Ænima'' artwork shows a painting of Bill Hicks, calling him "Another Dead Hero," and mentions of Hicks are found both in the [[liner notes]] and on the record.

===Censorship and aftermath===
In 1984, Hicks was invited to appear on ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'' for the first time. He had a joke that he used frequently in comedy clubs about how he caused a serious accident that left a classmate using a wheelchair. [[NBC]] had a policy that no handicapped jokes could be aired on the show, making his stand-up routine difficult to perform without mentioning words such as "wheelchair."{{citation needed|date=February 2015|reason=Quotations must be verifiably attributed to a reliable source per MOS:QUOTE}}

On October 1, 1993, Hicks was scheduled to appear on ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' on [[CBS]], where Letterman had recently moved. It was his 12th appearance on a Letterman late-night show, but his entire performance was removed from the broadcast: until that point the only occasion where a comedian's entire routine was cut after taping.&lt;ref name=Lahr&gt;{{Cite news| authorlink = John Lahr|first = John|last= Lahr| title = The Goat Boy Rises| url = http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1993/11/01/1993_11_01_113_TNY_CARDS_000365503?currentPage=all | work = [[The New Yorker]]|date=November 1, 1993| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080430075226/http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1993/11/01/1993_11_01_113_TNY_CARDS_000365503?currentPage=all | archivedate= April 30, 2008 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hicks' stand-up routine was removed from the show, Hicks said, because Letterman's producers believed the material, which included jokes involving religion and the [[Opposition to the legalization of abortion|anti-abortion]] movement, was unsuitable for broadcast.&lt;ref name=Lahr/&gt; Producer Robert Morton initially blamed CBS, which denied responsibility; Morton later conceded it was his decision.&lt;ref name=Lahr/&gt; Although Letterman later expressed regret at the way Hicks had been handled, Hicks did not appear on the show again.&lt;ref name= Lahr/&gt; Hicks was actively undergoing chemotherapy at the time of his final Late Show appearance, unbeknownst to Letterman and most others outside of Hicks' immediate family, and died less than four months later.&lt;ref&gt;''True'', 2002, pp. 193–214)&lt;/ref&gt;

Letterman finally aired the censored routine in its entirety on January 30, 2009. Hicks's mother, Mary, was present in the studio and appeared on-camera as a guest. Letterman took responsibility for the original decision to remove Hicks's set from the 1993 show. "It says more about me as a guy than it says about Bill," he said, after the set aired, "because there was absolutely nothing wrong with that."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Korn|first=Steven|title=David Letterman Airs the 'Lost' Bill Hicks Routine |work= [[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=February 3, 2009 |url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2009/02/03/david-letterman/ |accessdate=January 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Letterman&gt;{{Cite news |last=Crosbie |first=Lynn |title=The Globe Review Column; Pop Rocks; A Pop-Culture Epiphany; David Letterman's Apology to Mary Hicks |publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]] |date=February 3, 2009 |page=R1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influence on Denis Leary===
For many years, Hicks was friends with fellow comedian [[Denis Leary]]. But in 1993, Hicks was angered by Leary's album ''[[No Cure for Cancer]]'', which featured lines and subject matter similar to Hicks' routine.&lt;ref name="Outhwaite"&gt;&lt;!-- cite book --&gt; Outhwaite, Paul (November 2003). One Consciousness: An Analysis of Bill Hicks's Comedy, 3rd edition, D.M. Productions. {{ISBN|0-9537461-3-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''American Scream: The Bill Hicks Story'' by [[Cynthia True]], upon hearing the album Bill was furious. "All these years, aside from the occasional jibe, he had pretty much shrugged off Leary's lifting. Comedians borrowed, stole stuff, and even bought bits from one another. [[Milton Berle]] and [[Robin Williams]] were famous for it. This was different. Leary had practically taken line for line huge chunks of Bill's act and ''recorded'' it."&lt;ref name = "oouuos"/&gt; The friendship ended abruptly as a result.&lt;ref name="evolutionBook"&gt;{{Cite book| title=Bill Hicks: Agent of Evolution| first=Kevin |last=Booth |first2= Michael|last2= Bertin| year=2005 | publisher=Harper Collins
| isbn=0-00-719829-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At least three stand-up comedians have gone on the record stating they believe Leary stole Hicks's material as well as his persona and attitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://blog.joerogan.net/archives/92| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070607224107/http://blog.joerogan.net/archives/92| archivedate = June 7, 2007| title = Carlos Mencia is a weak minded joke thief

I stole his [Leary's] act. I camouflaged it with punchlines, and, to really throw people off, I did it before he did."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}. .&lt;/ref&gt; During a 2003 [[Comedy Central Roast]] of Denis Leary, comedian [[Lenny Clarke]], a friend of Leary's, said there was a carton of cigarettes backstage from Bill Hicks with the message, "Wish I had gotten these to you sooner." This joke was cut from the final broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title=Roasting a Comic They Turn Up the Flames Gently| work=Boston Globe| url=http://www.boston.com/dailyglobe2/222/living/Roasting_a_comic_they_turn_up_the_flames_gently+.shtml| archiveurl=https://archive.is/20030811054820/http://www.boston.com/dailyglobe2/222/living/Roasting_a_comic_they_turn_up_the_flames_gently+.shtml| archivedate=August 11, 2003| date=August 10, 2003| deadurl=yes| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The controversy surrounding plagiarism is also mentioned in ''American Scream'':

{{quote|text=Leary was in Montreal hosting the "Nasty Show" at Club Soda, and Colleen [McGarr?] was coordinating the talent so she stood backstage and overheard Leary doing material incredibly similar to old Hicks riffs, including his perennial [[Jim Fixx]] joke: "[[Keith Richards]] outlived Jim Fixx, the runner and health nut. The plot thickens." When Leary came offstage, Colleen, more stunned than angry, said, "Hey, you know that's Bill Hicks's material! Do you know that's his material?" Leary stood there, stared at her without saying a word, and briskly left the dressing room.&lt;ref name = "oouuos"&gt;{{Cite book| first = Cynthia|last= True| title = American Scream: The Bill Hicks Story| year=2002| publisher=Harper Paperbacks| isbn=0-380-80377-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Material and style==
Hicks's performance style was seen as a play on his audience's emotions. He expressed anger, disgust, and apathy while addressing the audience in a casual and personal manner, which he likened to merely conversing with his friends. He would invite his audiences to challenge authority and the [[existential]] nature of "accepted truth." One such message, which he often used in his shows, was delivered in the style of a news report (in order to draw attention to the negative slant news organizations give to any story about drugs):
{{quote|Today, a young man on acid realized that all matter is merely energy condensed to a slow vibration—that we are all one consciousness experiencing itself subjectively. There is no such thing as death, life is only a dream, and we're the imagination of ourselves. Here's Tom with the weather.&lt;ref&gt;Extract from ''[[Revelations (Bill Hicks)|Revelations]]'', London, 1993. The extract is part of the concluding track to the album, called "It's Just a Ride", in which he essentially outlines his world view.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The American philosopher and [[ethnomycology|ethnomycologist]] [[Terence McKenna]] was a frequent source of Hicks' most controversial psychedelic and philosophical counter-cultural material; he infamously acted out an abridged version of McKenna's "Stoned Ape" model of human evolution as a routine during several of his final shows.&lt;ref name="McKenna2013"&gt;{{cite web|last1=McKenna|first1=Terrence|title=Terrence Mckenna – The stoned ape theory|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnEKoFrx1rI|website=YouTube.com|accessdate=September 3, 2016|date=August 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="StonedApe1993"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bill Hicks – The stoned ape- theory in 3 minutes|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hreGAxAjt1c|website=YouTube.com|publisher=Anders Jacobsson|accessdate=September 3, 2016|date=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |first= Bill |last= Hicks |authorlink= Bill Hicks |year= 1997 |origyear= November 1992 – December 1993 |title= [[Rant in E-Minor]] (CD and MP3) |time= 0:58 |chapter= Pt. 1: Ch. 2: Gifts of Forgiveness |at= Track 8 |publisher= [[Rykodisc]] |oclc= 38306915}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another of Hicks's most quoted lines was delivered during a gig in Chicago in 1989 (later released as the bootleg ''I'm Sorry, Folks''). After a [[heckler]] repeatedly shouted "[[Free Bird#Legacy|Free Bird]]", Hicks screamed that "[[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] had the right idea; he was just an underachiever!" Hicks followed this remark with a misanthropic tirade calling for unbiased [[genocide]] against the whole of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;True, Cynthia, ''American Scream: The Bill Hicks Story'', Pan Macmillan, 2008, p.127.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hound, Rufus, ''Stand-Up Put-Downs'', Random House, 2011, p.59.&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of Hicks's routine involved direct attacks on mainstream society, religion, politics, and consumerism. Asked in a [[BBC]] interview why he cannot do a routine that appeals "to everyone", he said that such an act was impossible. He responded by repeating a comment that an audience member once made to him, "We don't come to comedy to think!", to which he replied, "Gee, where do you go to think? I'll meet you there!" When asked whether there was a "half way" point between audience expectations and his own, he said: "but my way ''is'' half-way between, I mean, this is a night-club, and, you know, these are adults, and what do you expect?"&lt;ref&gt;Hicks, Bill, ''Love All the People: Letters, Lyrics, Routines'', Hachette UK, 2009, unpaginated.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hicks often discussed popular [[conspiracy theories]] in his performances, most notably the [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassination]] of President [[John F. Kennedy]]. He mocked the [[Warren Report]] and the official version of [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] as a "lone nut assassin." He also questioned the guilt of [[David Koresh]] and the [[Branch Davidian]] compound during the [[Waco Siege]]. Hicks would end some of his shows, especially those being recorded in front of larger audiences as albums, with a mock "assassination" of himself on stage, making gunshot sound effects into the microphone while falling to the ground.

==Cancer diagnosis==
On June 16, 1993, Hicks was diagnosed with [[pancreatic cancer]] that had spread to his liver.&lt;ref name="hicks-lastword"&gt;{{cite web| first = Bill|last= Hicks| title = Last Word| url = http://www.billhicks.com/last-word.html| publisher= Bill Hicks| work=Bill Hicks family official site | accessdate = June 5, 2007|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070521205803/http://www.billhicks.com/last-word.html |archivedate = May 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He started receiving weekly [[chemotherapy]], while still touring and also recording his album, ''Arizona Bay'', with Booth. He was also working with comedian Fallon Woodland on a pilot episode of a new talk show, entitled ''Counts of the Netherworld'' for Channel 4 at the time of his death. The budget and concept had been approved, and a [[pilot episode|pilot]] was filmed. The ''Counts of the Netherworld'' pilot was shown at the various Tenth Anniversary Tribute Night events around the world on February 26, 2004. After being diagnosed with cancer, Hicks would often joke that any given performance could be his last; the public, however, was unaware of his condition, and only a few close friends and family members knew of the disease. He performed the final show of his career at [[Caroline's]] in New York on January 6, 1994; he moved back to his parents' house in [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]], Arkansas, shortly thereafter. He called his friends to say goodbye before he stopped speaking on February 14.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Outhwaite|first1=Paul|url=http://billhicks.com/Bio.html|title=Bio|publisher=Arizona Production Company, Inc.|accessdate=2016-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Hicks died from the effects of pancreatic cancer on Saturday, February 26, 1994 in Little Rock at the age of 32.&lt;ref name="bbc-tenyearson"&gt;{{Cite news

In early 1995 his family released a brief essay that Hicks had written a week prior to his death:

{{quote|text=I was born William Melvin Hicks on December 16, 1961 in Valdosta, Georgia. Ugh. Melvin Hicks from Georgia. Yee Har! I already had gotten off to life on the wrong foot. I was always "awake," I guess you'd say. Some part of me clamoring for new insights and new ways to make the world a better place. All of this came out years down the line, in my multitude of creative interests that are the tools I now bring to the Party. Writing, acting, music, comedy. A deep love of literature and books. Thank God for all the artists who've helped me. I'd read these words and off I went – dreaming my own imaginative dreams. Exercising them at will, eventually to form bands, comedy, more bands, movies, anything creative. This is the coin of the realm I use in my words – Vision. On June 16, 1993 I was diagnosed with having "liver cancer that had spread from the pancreas." One of life's weirdest and worst jokes imaginable. I'd been making such progress recently in my attitude, my career and realizing my dreams that it just stood me on my head for a while. "Why me!?" I would cry out, and "Why now!?" Well, I know now there may never be any answers to those particular questions, but maybe in telling a little about myself, we can find some other answers to other questions. That might help our way down our own particular paths, towards realizing my dream of New Hope and New Happiness. Amen. I left in love, in laughter, and in truth and wherever truth, love and laughter abide, I am there in spirit.&lt;ref name = "hicks-lastword"/&gt;}}

==Legacy==
His albums ''Arizona Bay'' and ''[[Rant in E-Minor]]'' were released posthumously in 1997 on the Voices imprint of the [[Rykodisc]] label. ''Dangerous'' and ''[[Relentless (Bill Hicks album)|Relentless]]'' were re-released simultaneously.

In a 2005 poll to find The Comedian's Comedian, comedians and comedy insiders voted Hicks 13th on their list of "The Top 20 Greatest Comedy Acts Ever".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=America's outlaw comic|url=http://socialistworker.org/print/2011/07/25/americas-outlaw-comic|work=Socialist Worker|accessdate=December 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In "[[Comedy Central]] Presents: 100 Greatest Stand-ups of All Time" (2004), Hicks was ranked 19th.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Comedy Central|title=Comedy Central 100 Greatest Standups of all Time|url=http://www.listology.com/list/comedy-central-100-greatest-standups-all-time|accessdate=2013-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2007, he was voted sixth on Britain's Channel 4 list of the 100 Greatest Stand-Up Comics, and rose to number four on the 2010 list.&lt;ref name="Channel 4"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-100-greatest-stand-ups | title = 100 Greatest Comedy Stand-ups vote from channel4.com | publisher = Channel 4 | accessdate = March 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Devotees have incorporated Hicks's words, image, and attitude into their own creations. By means of [[sampling (music)|audio sampling]], fragments of his rants, diatribes, social criticisms, and philosophies have found their way into many musical works, such as the live version of [[Super Furry Animals]]' "[[The Man Don't Give a Fuck]]" and [[Adam Freeland]]'s "[[We Want Your Soul]]". His influence on the band [[Tool (band)|Tool]] is well documented as he is sampled at the beginning of their song "[[Third Eye (song)|Third Eye]]"; he "appears" on the [[Fila Brazillia]] album ''[[Maim That Tune]]'' (1995) and on [[SPA (band)|SPA's]] eponymously entitled album ''[[SPA (album)|SPA]]'' (1997), which are both dedicated to Hicks; the British band [[Radiohead]]'s second album ''[[The Bends]]'' (1995) is also dedicated to his memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thequietus.com/articles/00206-radiohead-part-2-by-andrew-mueller |title=Radiohead Part II: On The Road With The Mercury Prize Nominees|last=Mueller |first=Andrew|authorlink=Andrew Mueller|date=July 24, 2008|work=[[The Quietus]]|accessdate=August 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; American indie rock band [[Built to Spill]]'s song "Planting Seeds" on its 2009 album ''[[There Is No Enemy]]'' alludes to Hicks's routine on advertising and marketing, which appears on the performance film ''Bill Hicks: Revelations''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Bould|first=Chris|title=Bill Hicks: Revelations|date=September 14, 1993|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0152183/|accessdate=2016-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singer/songwriter [[Tom Waits]] listed ''Rant in E-Minor'' as one of his 20 most cherished albums of all time.&lt;ref name="guardian-tomwaits"&gt;{{Cite news| date = March 20, 2005| authorlink = Tom Waits|last=Waits|first=Tom| title = What the stars are listening to: 'It's perfect madness'| url = https://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/mar/20/popandrock1| quote = Bill Hicks, blowtorch, excavator, truthsayer and brain specialist, like a reverend waving a gun around.| work = The Observer| publisher = The Guardian

The British actor [[Chas Early]] portrayed Hicks in the one-man stage show ''Bill Hicks: Slight Return'', which premiered in 2004. The show was co-written by [[Chas Early]] and [[Richard Hurst]], and imagined Hicks's view of the world 10 years after his death.

Hicks is mentioned in the 1999 British film ''[[Human Traffic]]''. In the movie, the young and hip club-going protagonist, "Jip" praises Hicks as an alternative thinker, and explains that he needs to get a regular infusion of Hicks's insights. Before leaving his house to start on the movie's main adventure, Jip states: "...first a daily injection of the late prophet Bill Hicks... just to remind me not to take life too seriously." He then watches a clip of one of Hicks's rants about drugs, and how they had never affected him badly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.springfieldspringfield.co.uk/movie_script.php?movie=human-traffic|title=Human Traffic (1999) Movie Script – SS|author=|date=|website=Springfield!
