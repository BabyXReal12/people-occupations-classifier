'''Paul Edward Lynde''' ({{IPAc-en|l|ɪ|n|d|}}; June 13, 1926{{spaced ndash}}January 11, 1982)&lt;ref&gt;Paul E. Lynde, age 3-9/12 years. U.S. Census, 1 April 1930, State of Ohio, County of Knox, enumeration district 9, p. 7A, family 202.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Edward Lynde, born 13 June 1926, died 11 January 1982. Ancestry.com. ''California Death Index, 1940–1997'' [database on-line]. [[Provo, Utah]], US: The Generations Network, Inc., 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; was an American comedian and [[actor]].  A [[character actor]] with a distinctively [[campy]] and snarky persona that often poked fun at his barely [[Coming out|in-the-closet]] homosexuality, Lynde was well known for his roles as [[List of Bewitched characters#Uncle Arthur|Uncle Arthur]] on ''[[Bewitched]]'' and the befuddled father Harry MacAfee in [[Bye Bye Birdie (musical)|''Bye Bye Birdie'']]. He was also the regular "center square" panelist on the [[game show]] ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'' from 1968 to 1981, and he voiced four [[Hanna-Barbera]] productions: he was Templeton the gluttonous rat in ''[[Charlotte's Web (1973 film)|Charlotte's Web]]'', Mildew Wolf from ''[[Cattanooga Cats#It's the Wolf!|It's the Wolf]]'' (a segment of ''[[Cattanooga Cats]]''), neighbor Claude Pertwee on ''[[Where's Huddles?]]'' and The Hooded Claw in ''[[The Perils of Penelope Pitstop]]''.

==Early life==
Paul Lynde was born in [[Mount Vernon, Ohio]], the son of Hoy Coradon and Sylvia Bell (Doup) Lynde. He graduated from [[Mount Vernon High School (Ohio)|Mount Vernon High School]] in 1944, and then studied drama at [[Northwestern University]] in [[Evanston, Illinois]], where his fellow students included [[Cloris Leachman]], [[Charlotte Rae]], [[Patricia Neal]], [[Jeffrey Hunter]] and [[Claude Akins]]. At Northwestern, he joined the Upsilon chapter of [[Phi Kappa Sigma]] and is listed among the more famous members of the fraternity. He graduated in 1948 and moved to [[New York City]], where he initially worked as a [[Stand-up comedy|stand-up comic]].&lt;ref name="biog"&gt;{{cite web | author= | title= Paul Lynde Biography (1926–1982) | url=http://www.biography.com/people/paul-lynde-9542425 | publisher=Biography.com | date= | accessdate=2008-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Lynde made his [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] debut in the hit revue ''[[New Faces of 1952]]'' in which he co-starred with fellow newcomers [[Eartha Kitt]], [[Robert Clary]], [[Alice Ghostley]], and [[Carol Lawrence]].&lt;ref name="what-a-c"&gt;{{cite web| author=| title=Paul Lynde| url=http://www.what-a-character.com/cgi-bin/display.cgi?id=LyndeP| publisher=What A Character!| date=| accessdate=2008-01-25| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010082557/https://www.what-a-character.com/cgi-bin/display.cgi?id=LyndeP| archivedate=2007-10-10| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his monologue from that revue, the "Trip of the Month Club," Lynde portrayed a man on crutches recounting his misadventures on the African safari he took with his late wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Vincent Canby | title=A Lost Theatrical Form Returns With a Smile | url=http://theater2.nytimes.com/mem/theater/treview.html?_r=1&amp;res=9E01E0DD133DF932A15755C0A96E958260&amp;oref=slogin | work=The New York Times | date=21 June 1998 | accessdate=2008-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show was filmed and released as ''[[New Faces (film)|New Faces]]'' in 1954.
[[File:Uncle arthur bewitched 1968.JPG|thumb|left|180px|Lynde as Uncle Arthur with [[Elizabeth Montgomery]] in the 1968 ''Bewitched'' episode, "The No Harm Charm"]]

After the revue's run, Lynde co-starred in the short-lived 1956 sitcom ''[[Stanley (television series)|Stanley]]'' opposite [[Buddy Hackett]] and [[Carol Burnett]], both of whom were also starting their careers in show business. That year, he guest starred on [[NBC]]'s ''[[The Martha Raye Show]]''.

Lynde returned to Broadway in 1960 when he was cast as Harry MacAfee, the father in ''[[Bye Bye Birdie]]''. He also played the role in the [[Bye Bye Birdie (film)|1963 film adaptation]]. That year, he recorded a live album, ''Recently Released'', issued as an [[LP record]]. All six tracks were written by him. Once he could afford writers, he rarely used his own material until his tenure on ''Hollywood Squares'' years later.

Lynde was in great demand in the 1960s. During the 1961-62 television season he was a regular on NBC's ''[[The Perry Como Show]]'' as part of the Kraft Music Hall players with [[Don Adams]], [[Kaye Ballard]] and [[Sandy Stewart (singer)|Sandy Stewart]]. He was a familiar face on many [[sitcom]]s, including ''[[The Phil Silvers Show]]'', ''[[The Patty Duke Show]]'', ''[[The Munsters]]'', ''[[The Flying Nun]]'', ''[[Gidget (TV series)|Gidget]]'', ''[[I Dream of Jeannie]]'', ''[[F Troop]]'', and [[variety show]]s such as ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' and ''[[The Dean Martin Show]]''. He also was featured in a number of 1960s films, including ''[[Send Me No Flowers]]'' and ''[[The Glass Bottom Boat]]'', both starring [[Doris Day]].

Lynde's best known sitcom role was on ''[[Bewitched]]'', where he made his debut appearance in the first-season episode "Driving Is the Only Way to Fly." His role as Samantha Stephens' nervous driving instructor Harold Harold was well received by viewers, as well as series star [[Elizabeth Montgomery]] and her husband, director/producer [[William Asher]], with whom Lynde became good friends. Asher then created the recurring role of Endora's practical-joking brother [[List of Bewitched characters#Uncle Arthur|Uncle Arthur]]. Lynde made 10 appearances on ''Bewitched'' as the beloved character, and was regularly seen with Montgomery and Asher off the set as well.&lt;ref name=salon/&gt;

Lynde also did extensive [[voice actor|voice work]] on [[animated cartoon]]s, particularly those of [[Hanna-Barbera Productions]]. His most notable roles included The Hooded Claw in ''[[The Perils of Penelope Pitstop]]'', Mildew Wolf from ''[[It's the Wolf]]'' (a segment of ''[[Cattanooga Cats]]''), and Pertwee from ''[[Where's Huddles?]]''. He also voiced gluttonous rat Templeton in the [[animated feature]] ''[[Charlotte's Web (1973 film)|Charlotte's Web]]''. Lynde's sardonic inflections added a dimension to such lines as the sly, drawn-out whine, "What's in it for ''meeee?"'' His distinctive voice remains popular among impressionists. Although it is sometimes assumed that actress [[Alice Ghostley]] based her speech patterns and mannerisms on Lynde's, according to actress [[Kaye Ballard]] "it was Paul who was influenced by Alice".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author= Dennis McLellan | title = 'Bewitched's' Esmeralda Dies at 81 | url = http://www.zap2it.com/news/zap-aliceghostleyobit,0,7769067.story | work = [[The Los Angeles Times]] | date = 22 September 2007 | accessdate = 2013-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Hollywood Squares''===
{{tone|section|date=June 2018}}
In 1966, Lynde debuted on the fledgling game show ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'' and quickly became its iconic guest star.  Eventually he assumed a permanent spot as the "center square," a move which ensured that he would be called upon by contestants at least once in almost every round. Despite an urban legend to the contrary, Lynde remained in the center at the producers' discretion.

On ''Hollywood Squares'' Lynde was best able to showcase his comedic talents with short, salty one-liners, spoken in his signature sniggering delivery.&lt;ref name="biog" /&gt; Many gags were thinly veiled allusions to his [[homosexuality]]. Asked, "You're the world's most popular fruit. What are you?" Lynde replied, "Humble."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.life.com/gallery/41132/image/2192797 {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asked how many men on a hockey team, Lynde said, "Oh, about half." Asked, "Who's generally better looking, a fairy or a pixie?," he objected, "Looks aren't everything!" and then, after a pause, quipped, "I think I'll take the fairy." Asked whether it was against the law in Texas to call a marine a "sissy," Lynde quipped, "I guess I'll have to take the law into my own hands."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.PaulLynde.info/audioclips/Other/audioclips.htm |title=Paul Lynde Clips |publisher=Paullynde.info |date=1960-06-05 |accessdate=2013-09-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017153440/http://paullynde.info/audioclips/Other/audioclips.htm |archivedate=2013-10-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other jokes relied on [[double entendre]], an alleged fondness for deviant behaviors, his misogyny, or dealt with touchy subject matter for 1970s television. Examples include:
: '''Q:''' "What unusual thing do you do if you have something called 'the gift of tongues'?"
: '''Lynde:''' "I wouldn't tell the grand jury. Why should I tell you?"

: '''Q:''' "The great writer George Bernard Shaw once wrote, 'It's such a wonderful thing, what a crime to waste it on children.' What is it?"	
: '''Lynde:''' "A whipping."&lt;ref&gt;Zingers from the Hollywood Squares LP, Event Records, 1974&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Paul Lynde: Off Center'', A&amp;E Home Video, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

: '''Q:''' "Paul, any good boat enthusiast should know that when a man falls out of your boat and into the water, you should yell 'Man overboard!' Now what should you yell if a woman falls overboard?"
: '''Lynde:''' "Full speed ahead!"&lt;ref&gt;''I Love the 70s: 1971'', VH1, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Lynde garnered considerable fame and wealth from the series, appearing a total of 707 times.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Peter Marshall (entertainer)|Peter Marshall]]'' ''[[Kaye Ballard]]'' (''E True Hollywood Story'', 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; He bought [[Errol Flynn]]'s old Hollywood mansion&lt;ref name=gazette/&gt; and spent an enormous amount of money on renovations and decorations.

===''The Paul Lynde Show'' and ''Temperatures Rising''===
In 1972, Lynde starred in a short-lived [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] sitcom, ''[[The Paul Lynde Show]]'', playing an uptight attorney and father at odds with his liberal-minded son-in-law. The series was a contractual fulfillment to ABC in place of an aborted ninth season of ''Bewitched''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/paul-lynde-9542425#synopsis|title=Paul Lynde|website=Biography.com|language=en-us|access-date=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Lynde starred as Paul Simms, the father of a family that consisted of wife Martha ([[Elizabeth Allen (actress)|Elizabeth Allen]]) and daughters Barbara (Jane Actman) and Sally ([[Pamelyn Ferdin]]). It also starred John Calvin as Barbara's husband, Howie, and [[Jerry Stiller]] and [[Anne Meara]] as Howie's parents. Critics perceived the show as a derivative of ''[[All in the Family]],'' then television's most-popular primetime program, although many admitted the writing was top notch and the sexual connotations gave it an extra bit of spice. Lynde was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Television Series Musical or Comedy|Best Actor Golden Globe]] for the show. Scheduled opposite the first half of the Top 30 hit ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]'' on [[CBS]] and the Top 20 hit ''[[Adam-12]]'' on NBC, the series garnered low ratings and was canceled after a single season.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Media reports at the time about ABC programs indicated that research showed viewers liked another ABC show, ''[[Temperatures Rising]]'', but disliked star [[James Whitmore]], whereas viewers liked Lynde but not ''The Paul Lynde Show''. Therefore, the network and producer [[William Asher]] decided to dismiss Whitmore and combine the positive elements of both series. Lynde was "transferred" to ''Temperatures Rising'' for the 1973–74 season. The trick backfired and the ratings for ''The New Temperatures Rising'' were even lower than the previous season. ABC cancelled the show and its time slot was taken by mid-season replacement ''[[Happy Days]]''. ABC decided to resuscitate the program, with additional cast changes (most notably, [[Alice Ghostley]] replaced Sudie Bond in the role of Lynde's sister, Edwina) and a new premise, in the summer of 1974, when it ran for two months. Neither actor's presence in the cast helped the show's sinking ratings and the series was cancelled for good.

In addition to the unsuccessful ''The Paul Lynde Show'' and ''Temperatures Rising'', Lynde starred in four failed television pilots in the 1960s:

* ''Howie'' (1962, CBS)
* ''Two's Company'' (1965, ABC)
* ''Sedgewick Hawk-Styles: Prince of Danger'' (1966, ABC)
* ''Manley and the Mob'' (1967, ABC)

Of the four shows, only the Victorian detective spoof ''Sedgewick Hawk-Styles: Prince of Danger'' was initially picked up by ABC, only to be cancelled at the last minute. William Asher commented in the [[A&amp;E (TV channel)|A&amp;E]] ''[[Biography (TV series)|Biography]]'' entry on Lynde that ABC had reservations about Lynde, most notably his increasingly erratic offscreen behavior and the persistent rumors of his homosexuality.&lt;ref name="biog"/&gt;

Lynde was regularly admired by his peers during his lifetime. [[Mel Brooks]] once described Lynde as being capable of getting laughs by reading "a phone book, tornado alert, or seed catalogue."&lt;ref name=salon/&gt; In 1976, Lynde received an Entertainer of the Year Emmy award for being voted the funniest man of the year, which he immediately turned over to host [[Jackie Gleason]] (who never won an Emmy award during his lifetime), citing him as "the funniest man ever." The unexpected gesture shocked Gleason.

===Summer stock theatre===
Lynde was a fixture&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ecommons.udayton.edu/archives_morse_media/72/ | title=Paul Lynde Interview | publisher=University of Dayton | work=eCommons | accessdate=January 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the [[Kenley Players]] [[summer stock theatre]] circuit, appearing in ''[[Don't Drink the Water (play)|Don't Drink the Water]]'' (1970, 1979), ''[[The Impossible Years]]'' (1969, 1978), ''Mother is Engaged'' (1974), ''My Daughter is Rated X'' (1973), ''[[Plaza Suite]]'' (1971), and ''Stop, Thief, Stop!'' (1975).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.kenleyplayershistory.com/productions.htm | title=Kenley Players Productions | accessdate=January 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In all he appeared in nine Kenley Players productions, more than any other headliner.&lt;ref name="kenplayhistmost"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.kenleyplayershistory.com/most.html | title=Most Appearances by a Headliner | work=Kenley Player History | accessdate=January 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Final years==
[[File:The Paul Lynde Comedy Hour Paul Lynde Nancy Walker 1975.jpg|thumb|right|''The Paul Lynde Comedy Hour'' (1975) with [[Nancy Walker]] ]]
Lynde's continuing popularity led to his being signed by ABC to host a series of specials from 1975 to 1979, including:
*''The Paul Lynde Comedy Hour'' (November 6, 1975) with [[Jack Albertson]], [[Nancy Walker]] and the [[The Osmonds|Osmond Brothers]];
*''[[The Paul Lynde Halloween Special]]'' (October 29, 1976) featuring the first prime-time network appearance of [[Kiss (band)|KISS]], along with [[Margaret Hamilton (actress)|Margaret Hamilton]] recreating her role as the Wicked Witch of the West from ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''. Hamilton and [[Billie Hayes]] (as ''[[H.R. Pufnstuf]]'''s Witchiepoo) teamed up in a skit where they ask Lynde to help them improve their (witches) image. Other guests included [[Betty White]], [[Donny Osmond|Donny]] and [[Marie Osmond]], [[Tim Conway]], and [[Roz Kelly]];
*''The Paul Lynde Comedy Hour'' (April 23, 1977) with [[Cloris Leachman]] and [[Tony Randall]];
*''T'was the Night Before Christmas'' (December 7, 1977) with [[Alice Ghostley]], [[Martha Raye]], [[George Gobel]] and [[Foster Brooks]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author= Joan Hanauer | title = Lynde Tries 'Different Christmas TV Special | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=so5IAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=pIMMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2769,2833107&amp;dq=paul+lynde+house&amp;hl=en | work = [[The Vindicator|The Youngstown Vindicator]] | date = 7 December 1977 | accessdate = 2013-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''The Paul Lynde Comedy Hour'' (May 20, 1978) with [[Juliet Prowse]], [[Brenda Vaccaro]] and [[Harry Morgan]];
*''Paul Lynde at the Movies'' (March 24, 1979) with Betty White, [[Vicki Lawrence]], [[Robert Urich]] and [[Gary Coleman]];
*''Paul Lynde Goes M-A-A-A-AD'' (May 20, 1979) with Marie Osmond, [[Charo]] and Vicki Lawrence.

Lynde was a regular guest on the 1976–79 variety show ''[[Donny &amp; Marie (1976 TV series)|Donny &amp; Marie]]'' until 1978. He lost his guest-starring role following an alcohol-related arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | title = Paul Lynde Arrested | publisher=''[[The Item|The Daily Item]]''| date = 4 January 1978 |url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1979&amp;dat=19780104&amp;id=nYciAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=bqoFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4795,1302171 | accessdate = 2013-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As demand for his services declined, he accepted a wider variety of job offers. He appeared as a guest weatherman for [[WTVG|WSPD-TV]] in [[Toledo, Ohio]] in 1978, to publicize both Hollywood Squares and a summer stock performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Paul Lynde doing the Weather | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX_igvcBICc | accessdate=26 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He appeared as Indian chief Nervous Elk alongside former ''Bye Bye Birdie'' co-star [[Ann-Margret]] in the 1979 comedy ''[[The Villain (1979 film)|The Villain]]'' (released as "Cactus Jack" in the UK), which was to be his final film role. Lynde had become disenchanted with being what he called "boxed into" ''Hollywood Squares'' and departed the series that same year. Acting jobs continued to be scarce, although it is unclear if this was due to Lynde's known substance abuse and alcohol problems, which made him difficult to work with.&lt;ref name=salon/&gt;

In 1980, ''Hollywood Squares'' was experiencing a downward trend in [[Nielsen ratings]]. Lynde was approached about returning to the program and initially declined, but changed his mind when told he would receive co-star billing with host Peter Marshall. He returned to the series in the spring of 1980 and remained with the show until its cancellation in February 1981.

In November 1980, the Beaux Arts Society, Inc. (founded in 1857) designated Paul Lynde "King" of the Beaux Arts Ball. [[Kitty Carlisle]] was designated "Queen" that year. Paul Lynde remained a Life Member of the Beaux Arts Society from 1980 until his untimely death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beauxartssociety.org/royal-family-.html|title=Royal Family|website=Thomas Robert Stevens|accessdate=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
On January 11, 1982, after Lynde had failed to attend a birthday celebration, his friend [[Paul Barresi]] became concerned. When he and another friend, actor Dean Ditman, could not get an answer on the phone or from knocking on his door, Barresi broke into the side entrance to Lynde's home in [[Beverly Hills, California]] and found him dead in his bed. He was 55 years old. Stories suggesting Lynde had a visitor at the time of his death who fled the scene circulated but could not be proven,&lt;ref name="biog"/&gt; as the comedian regularly activated his house alarm before retiring for the evening. When Barresi broke in, the alarm blared, implying Lynde was alone at the time of his death and that he had died in his sleep.&lt;ref name=death&gt;{{cite news | author = Paul Simon | title = Paul Lynde Suffers Heart Attack: Dead at 55 | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xBJGAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=KNEMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6913,912817&amp;dq=paul+lynde+heart+attack&amp;hl=en| work= [[Glasgow Daily Times|The Daily Times]] | date= 12 January 1982 | accessdate=2013-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rush-bio"&gt;{{cite news | author = Rush &amp; Molloy | title = Lynde Bio Squarely Denies He OD'd| url = http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/gossip/lynde-bio-squarely-denies-od-article-1.644941 | work = [[New York Daily News]] | date = 1 September 2005 | accessdate = 2013-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[coroner]] ruled the death a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]].&lt;ref name=death/&gt; Lynde's cremated remains are interred at Amity Cemetery, in [[Amity, Knox County, Ohio]], next to those of his brother Johnny and sister Helen. His father and mother are buried at the same cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Julia Keller | title = Bewitched by time | url = http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2010-08-11/entertainment/ct-live-0811-b-list-hometowns-20100811_1_bewitched-george-washington-s-virginia-tv-land | work = [[Chicago Tribune]] | date = 11 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Lynde's popularity and high regard from the public have been maintained since his death. A biography was published in 2005, titled ''Center Square: The Paul Lynde Story''. Authors Steve Wilson and Joe Florenski described Lynde as "[[Liberace]] without a piano" and that to most 1970s-era viewers, he was "a frustrated bit player and character actor on a daytime game show". To the homosexual community, his reputation was less than stellar: "In some ways, he came to symbolize what's perceived to be a self-loathing era for gay culture."&lt;ref name=salon/&gt;

Lynde's distinctive vocal delivery has also been widely imitated:
*The character of Wilford Wolf in the animated series ''[[The Kwicky Koala Show]]'' is voiced by [[John Stephenson (actor)|John Stephenson]] as an impersonation of Lynde.
*Cartoon creator/voice actor [[Seth MacFarlane]] has acknowledged that the voice of [[Roger (American Dad!)|Roger the Alien]] on ''[[American Dad!]]'' was modeled after Lynde.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RycYlI3-7DU|title=American Dad! - Seth on Paul Lynde and Patrick Stewart|first=|last=The Paley Center for Media|date=5 October 2012|publisher=|accessdate=14 June 2017|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The voice and humor of ''[[Queer Duck]]'' character Bi-Polar Bear, voiced by [[Billy West]], is performed in the style of Lynde, as is supervillain The Scoutmaster in the ''Simpsons'' episode "[[Radioactive Man (The Simpsons episode)|Radioactive Man]]".
*[[Steve Carell]] reprised Lynde's role as "Uncle Arthur" in the 2005 film ''[[Bewitched (2005 film)|Bewitched]]'', very much in Lynde's style.
*The voice of Big Cheese (voiced by [[Dean Hagopian]] in the show's English dub) on ''[[Samurai Pizza Cats]]'' is a Lynde impression.
*The voice and humor of William A. Mummy on the [[Game Show Network|GSN]] game show ''[[Late Night Liars]]'' is performed in the vein of Lynde as well.
*In the 1970s version of ''[[Match Game]]'', regular panelist [[Richard Dawson]] often spoke in the voice and mannerisms of Lynde.
*Escargoon's English voice in 'Kirby: Right Back At Ya!' is performed by Ted Lewis doing a Lynde impression.
*In 2010, Lynde's likeness appeared in the center square in the ''[[Futurama]]'' episode "[[Lethal Inspection]]", and again in the episode "[[The Six Million Dollar Mon]]". Both performances were delivered by [[Billy West]].
*Actor/comedian Michael Airington portrays Lynde in the show ''Oh My Goodness It's Paul Lynde'' and ''An Evening with Paul Lynde'', recreating Lynde's 1976 live show, and ''Off Center: The Paul Lynde Show''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/354355/An-Evening-with-Paul-Lynde/overview | title = An Evening with Paul Lynde | publisher = Movies.nytimes.com | date = | accessdate = 2009-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Airington licenses the rights from the Paul Lynde Estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2009/02/paul-lynde-play.html | title = Paul Lynde play at Exit Theatre gets pulled over copyright claim &amp;#124; Culture Monster &amp;#124; Los Angeles Times | publisher = Latimesblogs.latimes.com | date = 28 February 2009 |accessdate=2009-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael also sang the theme of ''[[Samurai Pizza Cats]]'' in an impersonated Paul Lynde voice.
*In 2018, drag queen [[BenDeLaCreme]] won the "Snatch Game" episode of [[RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars (season 3)|the third season of RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars]] with a portrayal of Lynde.

==Personal life==
Despite his campy and flamboyant television persona, Lynde's private life and sexual orientation were not directly acknowledged or discussed on television or in other media during his lifetime. According to an essay on the web site for [[FYI_(U.S._TV_network)#The_Biography_Channel|The Biography Channel]], in the 1970s, entertainment journalists did not investigate the private lives of performers who were best known as game show regulars.&lt;ref name="biography.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/news/tv-stars-of-the-1970s|title=TV Stars Who Ruled the 70s|publisher=|accessdate=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976, a ''[[People (American magazine)|People]]'' magazine article on Lynde included text about Stan Finesmith; the latter was described as Lynde's "suite mate" and "chauffeur-bodyguard."  The magazine did not include a photograph of Finesmith.  During Lynde's lifetime, this was as close as the media came to hinting at his homosexuality.&lt;ref name=salon&gt;{{cite web | author = [[Mike Sacks]] | title = Queer as Folk | url = http://www.salon.com/2005/08/23/lynde/ | work = [[Salon (website)|Salon]] | publisher = Salon Media Group | date = 23 August 2005 | accessdate = 2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cathy Rudolph, a friend of Lynde's who published a 2013 book entitled ''Paul Lynde: A Biography – His Life, His Love(s) and His Laughter'', stated in a 2018 interview that "being gay and having to hide it frustrated him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2018/04/18/bewitched-star-paul-lynde-struggled-with-childhood-insecurities-pal-claims.html|title='Bewitched' star Paul Lynde struggled with childhood insecurities, pal claims|last=Nolasco|first=Stephanie|publisher=Fox News|date=18 April 2018|accessdate=6 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, Lynde was involved in an accident in which a young actor fell to his death from the window of their hotel room in [[San Francisco]]'s [[Kimpton Sir Francis Drake Hotel|Sir Francis Drake Hotel]]. The two had been drinking for hours before 24-year-old James "Bing" Davidson slipped and fell eight stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=yiIhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=wGUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3437,3717020|title=Sarasota Herald-Tribune - Google News Archive Search|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lynde struggled with [[alcoholism]] and had numerous run-ins with the law and frequent arrests for [[public intoxication]].&lt;ref name="biog"/&gt; Marshall&lt;ref&gt;''Florence Henderson Show'', 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kaye Ballard]]&lt;ref&gt;Peter Marshall, Kaye Ballard; ''E! True Hollywood Story'', 2000&lt;/ref&gt; confirmed that Lynde, when inebriated, would sometimes ridicule his friends.
Lynde was involved in an incident at his alma mater, Northwestern University, in October 1977. He was the Grand Marshal for homecoming. At a fast food restaurant after the homecoming parade, he made racist remarks and gestures to African American NU professor James Pitts. Lynde later blamed his behavior on fatigue and inebriation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Moseley |first=Ray |date=28 October 1977 |title=Lynde Apologizes for Racial Slurs to NU Prof |url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1977/10/28/page/1/article/lynde-apologizes-for-racial-slurs-to-nu-prof |work= Chicago Tribune |access-date=19 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lynde suffered from weight-control problems and was honored in 1977 by [[Weight Watchers]]. That year, Lynde's beloved dog, Harry MacAfee, died.&lt;ref name=gazette&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | title = You Asked Us: About Funny, Fussy Actor Paul Lynde | publisher = ''[[The Gazette (Montreal)|The Montreal Gazette]]'' | date = 17 February 1973 | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=OoMuAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=qqEFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4105,5164883&amp;dq=paul+lynde+errol+flynn+house&amp;hl=en| accessdate = 2013-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lynde could not stay in the house without him and later bought a new home. He spent heavily to redecorate and renovate the house.

On January 4, 1978, Lynde was arrested outside of a tavern in [[Salt Lake City]] at approximately 1:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. for interfering with a police officer. The officer, who was investigating a car burglary, claimed Lynde kept insisting that the officer "attend to Lynde's complaint that his briefcase with $1,000 in cash and valuables inside had been stolen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | title = Paul Lynde Arrested | publisher=''[[The Item|The Daily Item]]''| date = 4 January 1978 |url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1979&amp;dat=19780104&amp;id=nYciAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=bqoFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4795,1302171 | accessdate = 2013-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complaint was later dropped.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

Lynde became sober and drug-free in early 1980.{{cn|date=August 2018}}
