'''Phillip Christopher Jupitus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|dʒ|uː|p|ɪ|t|ə|s}}; born 25 June 1962{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}) is an English [[stand-up comedy|stand-up]] and [[Improv comedy teacher|improv comedian]], [[actor]], [[performance poetry|performance poet]], [[cartoonist]] and  [[podcaster]]. Jupitus was a team captain on [[BBC Two]]'s popular music quiz ''[[Never Mind the Buzzcocks]]'' from its inception in 1996 until its end in 2015, and also appears regularly as a guest on several other [[panel game|panel show]]s, including ''[[QI]]'' and [[BBC Radio 4]]'s ''[[I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue]]''.

==Early life==
Born Phillip Swan in [[Newport, Isle of Wight|Newport]] on the [[Isle of Wight]], he took his stepfather Alexander's surname, Jupitus (a corruption of the [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] name Šeputis)&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/journalists/dominic-cavendish/3673513/Phill-Jupitus-Its-the-most-grown-up-thing-Ive-done.html|title=Phill Jupitus: 'It's the most grown-up thing I've done'|date=19 May 2008|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=2 May 2017|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; when he was 16.&lt;ref name="Questions"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/phill-jupitus-you-ask-the-questions-656068.html|title=Phill Jupitus: You ask the questions|date=13 March 2002|publisher=The Independent|accessdate=22 July 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jupitus attended a comprehensive school before winning a scholarship to a public school, [[Woolverstone Hall School]] near [[Ipswich]].&lt;ref&gt;Series 1 , Episode 2 : ''Alan Davies: As Yet Untitled''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
[[File:Phill Jupitus.jpg|thumb|Phill Jupitus in [[Edinburgh]], 2006.]]
Jupitus worked at the [[Department of Health and Social Security]] (DHSS) for five years, while he also wrote [[political poetry]] and drew cartoons. He resigned from the DHSS in 1984, hoping for a career in the music industry.

Using the moniker ''Porky the Poet'', Jupitus became associated with [[Anti-Fascist Action]] and the [[ranting poet]]ry scene, alongside Kool Knotes, [[Steven Wells|Seething Wells]], Swift Nick and [[Attila the Stockbroker]]. Jupitus approached local bands to offer himself as a support act for their tours: "I thought it looked easy, I was very cheap. If you got another band to support you, there are probably four of them and roadies and managers. But me—I just turned up and read poems."&lt;ref name=standupcom1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wilco.dircon.co.uk/jupitus.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050316212255/http://www.wilco.dircon.co.uk/jupitus.htm |archivedate=16 March 2005 |title=Giving it Large |first=Chris |last=Wilson}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first vinyl recordings were part of the live [[Newtown Neurotics]] album ''Kickstarting a Backfiring Nation'' as Porky the Poet in 1987.

Jupitus toured colleges, universities and student unions, supporting bands such as [[Billy Bragg]], [[the Style Council]] and [[The Housemartins]]. He supported [[Billy Bragg]] once more on the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]-sponsored [[Red Wedge]] tour in 1985: "In the early '80s, I got involved with Red Wedge, in which [[Neil Kinnock]] got various bands to stage concerts for Labour. The reason I got involved was 20% because I believed in the cause, 30% because I loved Billy Bragg, and 50% because I wanted to meet [[Paul Weller (singer)|Paul Weller]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/friday_review/story/0,,404976,00.html |title=Home entertainment: Phill Jupitus &amp;#124; The Guardian |publisher=Guardian.co.uk |date= |accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Red Wedge, he found it difficult to get other bookings, due to the decline of political poetry as a mainstream art. He got a job as a runner for the independent record label [[Go! Discs]], which had signed Billy Bragg and other bands, such as the Housemartins. Bragg said: "We ended up managing to get him a job at Go! Discs, which was brilliant. I was concerned that the cut-throat nature of the record business would make him jaded—underneath that rhino exterior there is quite a sensitive person—but that was before I realised that he was going to come back and do gigs again. Working at Go! Discs got his confidence up."

His performances of two of his poems, "Beano" and "Nobby", were included in the 1986 album ''Not Just Mandela'', alongside tracks by Billy Bragg and Attila the Stockbroker, amongst others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Various-Not-Just-Mandela/release/1742913 |title=Various - Not Just Mandela (Vinyl, LP) at Discogs |publisher=Discogs.com |date= |accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Released on Davy Lamp Records, all proceeds of the record were going to the [[Anti-Apartheid Movement]].

Jupitus became [[press officer]] and [[Master of Ceremonies|compere]] for The Housemartins (appearing in the 1986 music video for "[[London 0 Hull 4|Happy Hour]]"), using the role to continue being in front of an audience, while also filling support slots for other artists. During this time, he worked as a warm-up act on the [[Channel 4]] TV show ''The Show''. He quit working for Go! Discs in 1989 and fell back on his poetry and competing to try and gain a foothold on the [[London]] comedy circuit.

He conceived and directed the [[Brit Awards]]-nominated music video for Bragg's "[[Sexuality (Billy Bragg song)|Sexuality]]" in 1991 and wrote a parody version of that song about [[bestiality]]. He also appeared alongside [[R.E.M.]] in the music video for Bragg's "You Woke Up My Neighbourhood" and performed in ''[[Searchlight (magazine)|Searchlight]]'' magazine's 2006 "Hope Not Hate" campaign tour with Bragg.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} He has also appeared numerous times at the [[Glastonbury Festival]] as a DJ and a [[master of ceremonies|compere]] in [[The Left Field]] tent. Jupitus produced the music video for [[Kirsty MacColl]]'s 1991 single "All I Ever Wanted" from the album ''[[Electric Landlady]]''.&lt;ref name=kirsty1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kirstymaccoll.com/information/conn/j.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140629075655/http://www.kirstymaccoll.com/information/conn/j.htm |archivedate=29 June 2014 |title=Connections: J is for ... }}&lt;/ref&gt; He appeared at her tribute concert in 2002 as compere, and also sang one of her songs, "[[Kite (Kirsty MacColl album)|Fifteen Minutes]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kirstymaccoll.com/information/memorial/concert/index.htm |title=Tributes &amp; Obituaries |publisher=Kirstymaccoll.com |date= |accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, he released the stand-up comedy DVD ''Phill Jupitus Live: Quadrophobia''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0307327/|title=Phill Jupitus Live: Quadrophobia (2000)|publisher=IMDb.com|accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, he appeared as a sports journalist in the film ''[[Mike Bassett: England Manager]]''.

Jupitus made a guest appearance on the ''[[Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band]]'' 40th anniversary DVD performing with the band on the track "Mr. Apollo" and has toured with them around the UK.  He appears on the Bonzos' 2007 album, ''[[Pour l'Amour des Chiens]]''. Also in 2007, he performed with [[The Blockheads]] on their 30th anniversary tour. He continued to perform with them sporadically since [[Ian Dury]]'s death, also appearing in Dury's place for "[[Drip Fed Fred]]" during the [[Madness (band)|Madness]] concert at Wembley Arena shortly before Dury's death. Jupitus performed at the [[Reading Festival|Reading]] and [[Leeds Festival|Leeds]] festivals in 2008.

On 13–14 February 2009, Jupitus co-hosted the first BadMovieClub&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://badmovieclub.co.uk |title=Van Henderson |publisher=Badmovieclub.co.uk |date= |accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; on [[Twitter]]. At midnight, over 2,000 Twitter users simultaneously pressed 'Play' on the film ''[[The Happening (2008 film)|The Happening]]'' and continued to 'tweet' whilst watching, creating a collective viewing experience that generated 40,000 'tweets' in under two hours. The first showing took place at 9:00pm, hosted by [[Graham Linehan]].
Jupitus was awarded an honorary doctorate by the [[University of Essex]] in South Essex College's congregation ceremony in [[Southend-on-Sea|Southend]] on 30 September 2010.

On 6 October 2010, Jupitus, along with Emma Kennedy, hosted a special comedy evening at the Canterbury Animation Festival 'Anifest'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canterburyanifest.com/phill-jupitus/ |title=Phill Jupitus |publisher=Canterburyanifest.com |date=2 November 2014 |accessdate=3 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003012159/http://www.canterburyanifest.com/phill-jupitus/ |archivedate=3 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He will be returning to ''Anifest 2011''&lt;ref name="Anifest"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canterburyanifest.com/|title=Canterbury Anifest|last=Jupitus|first=Phill|date=12 September 2011|publisher= Animate &amp; Create|accessdate=12 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 1 October 2011.

Jupitus attended the "I Do To Equal Marriage" event which celebrated the introduction of [[same-sex marriage in the United Kingdom|same-sex marriage]] in England and Wales in March 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/u/u/thousands-help-comedian-sandi-toksvig-renew-vows-after-introduction-of-gay-marriage.1396102421|title=Thousands help comedian Sandi Toksvig renew vows after introduction of gay marriage|publisher=Heraldscotland.com|date=29 March 2014|accessdate=1 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radio===
Jupitus began hosting his own radio show on [[BBC London 94.9|BBC GLR]] in 1995, a regular job that would last until 2000.
After that, he embarked on his first stand-up comedy tour of the UK, ''Jedi, Steady, Go'', performing the ''[[Star Wars]]'' story in a comedic fashion.&lt;ref name=UKTV&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uktv.co.uk/?uktv=standardItem.index&amp;aID=535950 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051228145455/http://www.uktv.co.uk/?uktv=standarditem.index&amp;aID=535950 |archivedate=28 December 2005 |title=Who is Phill Jupitus? }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Phill Jupitus was a stand-in presenter on [[BBC Radio 2]] for [[Steve Wright (DJ)|Steve Wright]] while he was away on holiday.

Jupitus was the breakfast DJ on [[BBC Radio 6 Music]] from 2002 until 30 March 2007 (the last song played, by listener request, was "Broadway" by [[the Clash]]), and made brief returns to the station during the summer of 2007, sitting in for [[Stephen Merchant]] on Sunday afternoon and [[Liz Kershaw]] on Saturday mornings. In 2010, he publicly criticised the BBC's announcement that it was to discontinue the station, describing the decision as "not only an act of cultural vandalism, it's also an affront to the memory of [[John Peel]] and a slap in the face to thousands of licence-payers."&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news | url= https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/feb/26/bbc-6-music-licence-payers | title= Killing BBC 6 Music would be a slap in the face to licence-payers | work=The Guardian | location=London | date=26 February 2010 | accessdate=22 May 2010 | first=Phill | last=Jupitus}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jupitus has since written a book about his time on 6 Music, entitled ''Good Morning Nantwich: Adventures in Breakfast Radio''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Plunkett |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/aug/09/phill-jupitus-6-music |title=Phill Jupitus interview: 'I am not everyone's cup of tea' &amp;#124; Media |publisher=Guardian.co.uk |date= |accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In February 2010, as part of his research for the book, Jupitus presented the breakfast show for one week on [[Bournemouth University]] student radio station, [[Nerve* Radio]], produced by Mog McIntyre and co-presented by regular student presenters 'Guy Larsen &amp; Jess Bracey'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.echo-news.co.uk/news/5023658.Guy_joins__Phill_Jupitus_for_breakfast/ |title=Guy joins Phill Jupitus for breakfast (From Echo) |publisher=Echo-news.co.uk |date= |accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 September 2009, Jupitus narrated a half-hour documentary on [[BBC Radio 4]] about the comic strip ''[[Calvin and Hobbes]]'' created by [[Bill Watterson]].&lt;ref name="BBC-Calvin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00mr2fj|title=Calvin and Hobbes|last=Jupitus|first=Phill|date=22 September 2009|publisher=BBC Radio 4|accessdate=14 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jupitus has worked on [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]] as a regular contributor to ''[[Loose Ends (radio)|Loose Ends]]'', ''[[The News Quiz]]'' (where his performances are notable for a range of parody voices), ''[[I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue]]'' and ''[[Just a Minute]]''. He also presented ''Best Sellers''—a series on the life and work of [[Peter Sellers]]—and wrote and presented ''Disneyfied'', a documentary on the work of [[Walt Disney]].

Jupitus has also twice appeared on the Radio 4 show ''[[The Unbelievable Truth (radio show)|The Unbelievable Truth]]'' and is a regular guest with the [[The Comedy Store Players|Comedy Store Players]].

===Television===
Jupitus was one of the panellists on the first TV episode of the show ''Loose Talk'', which made a brief transition from radio to television in 1994. In 1996, he joined BBC Two's pop quiz show ''[[Never Mind the Buzzcocks]]'' as a regular team captain – having appeared in every single episode, except for series 25, episode 6. He frequently appears on ''[[QI]]'' as a guest panellist. He has a history of mimicking the ''QI'' host, [[Stephen Fry]], while on the show. In December 1999, he had the lead role in ''[[Dark Ages (TV series)|Dark Ages]]'', an ITV sitcom parodying preparations (and fears) for the year 2000, set in Essex in the year 999.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/dark_ages/]&lt;/ref&gt; Jupitus has played Councillor Cowdrey in [[CITV]] children's series ''Bottom Knocker Street'' since its first series in summer 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/bottom_knocker_street/ |title=Bottom Knocker Street - ITV Sitcom - British Comedy Guide |publisher=Comedy.co.uk |date= |accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jupitus has presented several editions of the popular ''Top Ten'' series for Channel 4, while also joining another comedy panel game—''[[It's Only TV...but I Like It]]''—as a team captain, alongside [[Jonathan Ross (television presenter)|Jonathan Ross]] and [[Julian Clary]].

He has made one appearance in an episode of ''[[Holby City]]'' as a patient (in "Men are from Mars"). As a voice actor he has provided the voices for [[Blackberry (rabbit)|Dandelion]] in an ITV adaptation of ''[[Watership Down (TV series)|Watership Down]]'' and also performing a selection of voices for ''[[Rex the Runt]]'' by [[Aardman Animations]].

Jupitus is a continuity announcer for the UKTV channel [[Dave (TV channel)|Dave]] during the channel's evening schedule. During 2008, he did the voice over work for the Dave show ''[[Batteries Not Included (TV series)|Batteries Not Included]]''. He also took part in the Dave show Comedy Exchange, where he went to America, while ''[[Eugene Mirman]]'' came to Britain. Here they each performed different routines in various events. He has appeared in ''[[Argumental]]'' for the same channel, where team captain Marcus Brigstocke made him laugh so hard he fell off his chair and took a long time to recover.  Jupitus and Brigstocke were reunited on the Radio 4 show (hosted by Brigstocke) ''[[I've Never Seen Star Wars (radio series)|I've Never Seen Star Wars]]'', in which Jupitus tried out things that he'd never attempted before, such as eating a Findus Crispy Pancake, undergoing a [[colonic irrigation]], and shaving another person's head.

During the 2008 [[Major League Baseball]] season, Jupitus presented a feature during the seventh inning stretch of Channel Five's featured Sunday night game. Each week he would read a section or quote from one of his favourite baseball-related books. He is a fan of the [[Boston Red Sox]] and has their logo tattooed on his arm.

In December 2008, Jupitus took part as a guest presenter on [[RTÉ]]'s comical topical discussion show ''[[The Panel (Irish TV series)|The Panel]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rte.ie/tv/thepanel/host.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030065756/http://www.rte.ie/tv/thepanel/host.html |date=30 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theatre===
Jupitus co-wrote and starred in the play ''Waiting for Alice'' with [[Andre Vincent]] which had a run at the [[Edinburgh Fringe Festival]]. The world premiere took place on 16 July 2007 at the St. Ives Theatre in [[St Ives, Cornwall|St Ives]], [[Cornwall]].

Jupitus and [[Marcus Brigstocke]] appeared together in the UK tour of ''Totally Looped'', performing at the [[Theatre Royal, Brighton|Theatre Royal]], [[Brighton]], the [[Kings Theatre, Southsea|King's Theatre]], [[Southsea]], [[Portsmouth]] and the [[Victoria Hall (Hanley)|Victoria Hall]], [[Hanley, Staffordshire|Hanley]], [[Stoke-on-Trent]] in spring 2009.

In October 2009, Jupitus joined the [[West End theatre]] cast of ''[[Hairspray (musical)|Hairspray]]'', playing the role of Edna Turnblad at the [[Shaftesbury Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://westend.broadwayworld.com/article/Photo_Flash_Belinda_Carlisle_And_Phill_Jupitus_Are_West_End_HAIRSPRAY_Bound_20090902 |title=Photo Flash: Belinda Carlisle And Phill Jupitus Are West End 'HAIRSPRAY Bound! |publisher=Westend.broadwayworld.com |date=30 October 2007 |accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the 2011 tour of ''[[Spamalot]]'', playing the role of King Arthur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://westend.broadwayworld.com/article/Phill_Jupitus_Announced_to_Play_Arthur_In_2011_SPAMALOT_Tour_20101123#ixzz1FHTwunKv |title=Phill Jupitus Announced to Play Arthur In 2011 SPAMALOT Tour |publisher=Westend.broadwayworld.com |date= |accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 January 2015, Jupitus was confirmed as starring opposite [[Jason Manford]] in the 2015 tour of [[Mel Brooks]]' musical ''[[The Producers (musical)|The Producers]]''. He will be portraying Franz Liebkind, until 16 May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whatsonstage.com/aberdeen-theatre/news/producers-bedella-jupitus-casting_36928.html|title=David Bedella and Phill Jupitus join the cast of The Producers|publisher=Whatsonstage.com|date=16 January 2015|accessdate=17 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has since appeared in ''[[Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (musical)|Chitty Chitty Bang Bang]]'' also alongside Jason Manford on a tour of the UK.

===Podcasts===
Since August 2008, he has been the host of ''[[The Times]]'' football [[podcast]] "The Game", replacing the previous co-hosts [[Gabriele Marcotti]] and [[Guillem Balague]], although Marcotti will still be the regular pundit on the show.

Between September 2008 and June 2011, Jupitus produced a podcast along with Phil Wilding, who produced his BBC 6Music show, called ''[[Phill And Phil's Perfect Ten|Phill and Phil's Perfect Ten]]''. Initially being released fortnightly it later became more sporadic due to the pair's work commitments. In April 2009, archive episodes were made available for purchase on audible and iTunes as audiobook bundles of four with bonus 'perfect ones' attached. Since ending the podcast in June 2011 the pair have indicated that all back-episodes will be released free at some point in the future.
