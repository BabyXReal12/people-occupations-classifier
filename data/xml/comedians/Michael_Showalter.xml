'''Michael Showalter''' (born June 17, 1970) is an American comedian, actor, director, writer and producer. He is a member of the sketch comedy trio [[Stella (comedy group)|Stella]]. Showalter first came to recognition as a cast member on MTV's ''[[The State (1993 TV series)|The State]]'', which aired from 1993 to 1995. He and [[David Wain]] created the [[Wet Hot American Summer (franchise)|''Wet Hot American Summer'' franchise]], with Showalter co-writing and starring in ''[[Wet Hot American Summer]]'' (2001), and the [[Netflix]] series. Showalter wrote and directed ''[[The Baxter]]'' (2005), in which he starred with [[Michelle Williams (actress)|Michelle Williams]], [[Justin Theroux]] and [[Elizabeth Banks]]. Both of the films featured many of his co-stars from ''The State'', and so do several of his other projects. Showalter is also a co-creator, co-producer, actor, and writer for the TV series ''[[Search Party (TV series)|Search Party]]''.

==Early life==
Michael Showalter was born in [[Princeton, New Jersey]], the son of [[Elaine Showalter]] (née Cottler), an author, literary critic, and professor, and English Showalter, a Yale-educated professor of 18th century [[French literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/99/Michael-Showalter.html |title=Michael Showalter Biography (1970–) |publisher=Filmreference.com |date=June 17, 1970 |accessdate=November 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father is [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopalian]] and his mother is [[Jewish]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishjournal.com/home/preview.php?id=14554 "Romantic Comedy Loser Finds Love"], ''[[The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles|Jewish Journal]]'', September 2, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thejc.com/culture/interviews/i-ve-always-been-seen-by-other-people-as-jewish-1.441957 The Jewish Chronicle: "'I’ve always been seen by other people as Jewish'" by Stephen Applebaum] November 14, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; He has one older sister, Vinca Showalter LaFleur, a professional speechwriter. He attended [[Princeton High School (New Jersey)|Princeton High School]]. For five years, Showalter shared an apartment with his friend, comedian and actress [[Andrea Rosen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher=The Apiary| url=http://www.theapiary.org/archives/2007/10/inside_with_and_1.html| title=Inside With: Andrea Rosen| author=Eliot Glazer| date=October 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Showalter began his undergraduate studies at [[New York University]], where he joined the sketch comedy group ''The New Group''. He transferred to and graduated from [[Brown University]]. After he completed college, ''The New Group'' changed its name to ''[[The State (1993 TV series)|The State]]'' and began creating video shorts for an MTV show called ''[[You Wrote It, You Watch It]]'', hosted by [[Jon Stewart]]. ''The State'' was then picked up as its own show, which aired for two years on MTV.

Showalter has also had several smaller roles in movies and TV shows. He played Ron Parker, the arrogant host of ''[[Cheap Seats (TV series)|Cheap Seats]]'', on [[ESPN Classic]] in the pilot episode. However, after a bookcase fell on Showalter's character, tape librarians (and brothers) [[Randy Sklar|Randy]] and [[Jason Sklar]] took over the hosting duties. Showalter spent a brief time as a correspondent on ''[[The Daily Show]]'' (1996). He is also one half of The Doilies, an acoustic comedy band, in which he sings lead vocals opposite guitarist [[Zak Orth]]. In 2005 he wrote, directed and starred in the film ''[[The Baxter]]''.
[[File:Michael Showalter.jpg|thumb|Showalter in 2007]]
Showalter is the host of ''The Michael Showalter Showalter'', an original Internet series on [[Collegehumor.com]] which premiered January 16, 2007. His first guest was comedian [[Zach Galifianakis]]. Other guests have included [[David Cross]], [[Michael Ian Black]], [[Paul Rudd]], [[David Wain]], [[Andy Samberg]], [[Michael Cera]], and [[Mike Birbiglia]]. In the fall and winter of 2006, Showalter toured the US with frequent collaborator Michael Ian Black. In March 2007 Showalter briefly toured as the opening act for [[Janeane Garofalo]]. ''[[The Ten]]'' reunites him with frequent collaborators from ''[[The State (1993 TV series)|The State]]''.

Showalter signed with [[JDub Records]], a non-profit record label, in June 2007. He released his first stand-up CD titled ''Sandwiches &amp; Cats '' in November 2007. He teaches screenwriting at [[New York University]]'s Graduate Film School.

Showalter teamed up once more with [[Michael Ian Black]] in the [[Comedy Central]] series ''[[Michael and Michael Have Issues]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://michaelianblack.typepad.com/blog/2008/07/come-see-michae.html |title=Michael Ian Black: Come See Michael &amp; Michael Have Issues |publisher=Michaelianblack.typepad.com |date=July 31, 2008 |accessdate=November 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which premiered in July 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Denise |last=Martin |work=LA Times |title=Comedy Central commits to 'Michael and Michael Have Issues' |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2009/02/comedy-central.html |date=February 18, 2009 |accessdate=February 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The show detailed the two Michaels' trials and tribulations as they create a television series. They confirmed the series' cancellation in early 2010.

In an interview with ''The Rumpus'' in February 2009, Showalter talked about a memoir he is working on. "I am writing an 'important' memoir about not being able to write an important memoir. It winds up being kind of a novel-length comedic essay on insecurity and procrastination."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://therumpus.net/2009/02/the-rumpus-interview-with-michael-showalter/ |title=The Rumpus Interview With Michael Showalter |publisher=The Rumpus.net |date= |accessdate=November 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The book, ''Mr. Funny Pants'', was published in February 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Mr-Funny-Pants-Michael-Showalter/dp/0446542105 |title=Amazon.com: ''Mr. Funny Pants''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He appeared twice on the [[NBC]] drama ''[[Law &amp; Order]]'': in the episode "Endurance", which aired on October 18, 2000, and in the episode "Reality Bites", which aired on October 16, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thecomicscomic.typepad.com/thecomicscomic/2009/09/law-order-sets-new-record-for-comedians-in-an-episode-thats-not-about-comedy.html |title=the comic's comic: Law &amp; Order sets new record for comedians in an episode that's not about comedy |publisher=Thecomicscomic.typepad.com |date=September 18, 2009 |accessdate=November 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Showalter also appeared in a series of commercials advertising the [[Toyota Yaris]], starting in late 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/09/21/michael-showalter-toyota_n_974246.html |work=Huffington Post  | first=Christine | last=Friar | title=Michael Showalter's Toyota Commercials Make Us Want To Buy A Yaris (VIDEOS) | date=September 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 Showalter and [[Michael Ian Black]] launched a podcast called "Topics" in which the duo discuss evergreen topics in a serious manner, although if something funny comes up, it's okay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://topicspodcast.com/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20131229023016/http://topicspodcast.com/ |archivedate=December 29, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Showalter was a writer on the ABC sitcom ''[[Super Fun Night]]''.
 
In 2014, Showalter co-wrote with David Wain ''[[They Came Together]]''. Wain and Showalter then co-wrote the eight-episode Netflix prequel ''[[Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp]]'' based on the 2001 film with almost the entire cast of the original film returning. Showalter himself appeared as Gerald "Coop" Cooperberg and President [[Ronald Reagan]] in the series. The series premiered on July 31, 2015, and was more well received by critics. He also co-wrote and starred in the Netflix sequel ''[[Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later]]'' which premiered in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fleming Jr|first=Mike |url=http://deadline.com/2016/10/alyssa-milano-wet-hot-american-summer-ten-years-later-season-two-1201838684/|title=Alyssa Milano Joins Season 2 Of ‘Wet Hot American Summer’|work=Deadline|date=2016-10-19|accessdate=2016-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 his film ''[[Hello, My Name Is Doris]]'' debuted at SXSW, where it was acquired by [[Roadside Attractions]]. It was released in the United States in March 2016, and received critical acclaim.

His 2017 film ''[[The Big Sick]]'' starred [[Kumail Nanjiani]], [[Zoe Kazan]], [[Holly Hunter]] and [[Ray Romano]]. It saw a wide theatrical release and had an overwhelmingly positive 98% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes, and was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay]].

==Personal life==
Showalter married Anne Kalin Ellis on January 16, 2011, in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cnettv.cnet.com/2001-1_53-50090984.html |title=Ep. 634: Where Michael Showalter &amp;#124; CNET TV &amp;#124; Video Product Reviews, CNET Podcasts, Tech Shows, Live CNET Video |publisher=Cnettv.cnet.com |date=July 15, 2010 |accessdate=November 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
