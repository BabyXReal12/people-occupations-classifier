'''James Thomas Fallon''' (born September 19, 1974) is an American comedian, actor, television host, singer, writer, and producer. He is known for his work in television as a [[cast member]] on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' and as the host of [[late-night talk show]] ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon]]'' and before that ''[[Late Night with Jimmy Fallon]]''. He grew up with an interest in comedy and music, moving to [[Los Angeles]] at 21 to pursue opportunities in [[stand-up comedy]].

He was commissioned to join [[NBC]]'s ''Saturday Night Live'' as a cast member in 1998, fulfilling a lifelong dream. Fallon remained on ''SNL'' for six years between 1998 and 2004, co-hosting the program's [[Weekend Update]] segment and becoming a celebrity in the process. He left the program for the film industry, starring in films such as ''[[Taxi (2004 film)|Taxi]]'' (2004) and ''[[Fever Pitch (2005 film)|Fever Pitch]]'' (2005).

Following his film career, Fallon returned to television as the host of ''[[Late Night with Jimmy Fallon]]'' on NBC in 2009, where he became well known for his emphasis on music and games. He moved from that program to become the sixth permanent host of the long-running ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' in 2014. In addition to his television work, Fallon has released two comedy albums and five books.

==Early life==
James Thomas Fallon was born in the [[Bay Ridge, Brooklyn|Bay Ridge]] neighborhood of [[Brooklyn, New York]] on September 19, 1974, the son of Gloria (''née'' Feeley) and James W. Fallon.&lt;!--- no evidence of "Sr." ---&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/97/Jimmy-Fallon.html|title=Jimmy Fallon Biography|publisher=Filmreference.com|accessdate=August 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qphYAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=%22James+W%22+Fallon+GLORIA+Saugerties&amp;dq=%22James+W%22+Fallon+GLORIA+Saugerties&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=dHVcUYuhEaSbyAHw5oDwCQ&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAA|title=Who's who Among Students in American Universities and Colleges|accessdate=April 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smolenyak|first1=Megan|url=http://irishamerica.com/2014/01/jimmy-fallon-family-tree|title=Jimmy Fallon Family Tree|work=Irish America|date=January 27, 2014|accessdate=February 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is of German, Irish, and Norwegian descent. His paternal grandmother, Luise Schalla, was a German immigrant from [[Osterholz-Scharmbeck]], while one of his maternal great-grandfathers, Hans Hovelsen, was a Norwegian immigrant from [[Fredrikstad]]. Another set of great-great-grandparents were Thomas Fallon, an Irishman from [[County Galway]], and Louisa Stickever, the daughter of an Irishman born in France and his Irish wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Oh|first1=Eunice|last2=Zhou|first2=Momo|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20415279,00.html|title=Jimmy Fallon's GTJ Emmy Prep: Gym, Tan, Jokes|work=People|date=August 24, 2010|accessdate=August 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=irm1&gt;{{cite web|last=Smolenyak|first=Megan|url=http://irishamerica.com/2014/01/jimmy-fallon-family-tree|title=Jimmy Fallon Family Tree|publisher=Irish America|date=1903-09-05|accessdate=2014-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Vietnam War]] veteran, Fallon's father spent his adolescence singing in street-corner [[doo-wop]] groups.&lt;ref name="NYMagazine"&gt;{{cite web|last=Levy|first=Ariel|url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/arts/features/2139|title=''Not'' Jerry Seinfeld|work=New York|date=October 18, 1999|accessdate=August 23, 2013|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after his son's birth, he started working as a machine repairman for [[IBM]] in [[Kingston, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Debbie McGoldrick|url=http://www.irishcentral.com/news/entertainment/late-nights-all-right-with-fallon-41094027-237630181.html|title='Night' right for Jimmy Fallon|publisher=IrishCentral.com|date=March 14, 2009|accessdate=August 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In preparation, the family relocated nearby to [[Saugerties (village), New York|Saugerties, New York]]. Fallon has described his childhood as "idyllic",&lt;ref name="VF"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2014/02/jimmy-fallon-the-tonight-show-new-york|title=Heeeeere's Jimmy!|author=David Kamp &amp; Jessica Diehl|date=February 2014|work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|accessdate=May 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; while his parents have been noted as overprotective. He and his sister, Gloria, were unable to leave their home&lt;ref name=rs/&gt; and had to ride their bicycles in the backyard.&lt;ref name="spin02"/&gt; Fallon attended the [[Roman Catholic]] school [[St. Mary of the Snow (school)|St. Mary of the Snow]]. He considered being a priest, inspired by his experiences as an [[altar boy]],&lt;ref name="spin02"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sanctepater.com/2012/02/jimmy-fallon-on-his-catholicism.html|title=Jimmy Fallon on His Catholicism|publisher=Sancte Pater|date=February 4, 2012|accessdate=August 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but became more interested in comedy instead. He spent many nights recording the radio program ''[[Dr. Demento|The Dr. Demento Show]]'' on a [[reel-to-reel]] recorder, which exposed him to both comedy and music.&lt;ref name="VF"/&gt;

As a teenager, Fallon developed an obsession with the late-night comedy program ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', watching it religiously. He grew up watching the show, viewing "the clean parts" that his parents taped for him. He and Gloria would re-enact sketches like "The Festrunk Brothers" with friends.&lt;ref name="spin00"/&gt; Fallon was such a fan that he made a weekly event of watching the show in his dormitory during college.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} In his teens, he impressed his parents with different impersonations, including actor [[James Cagney]]&lt;ref name="Star Bio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribute.ca/people/Jimmy+Fallon/10077|title=Jimmy Fallon star bio|publisher=Tribute Entertainment Media Group|accessdate=May 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Allmusic"&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p532752/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=AMG Artist: Jimmy Fallon|last=Wilson|first=MacKenzie|publisher=Macrovision Corporation|accessdate=May 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and comedian [[Dana Carvey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview|last=Fallon|first=Jimmy|interviewer=Jimmy Fallon|title=Late Night with Jimmy Fallon|last2=Carvey|first2=Dana|url=http://thecomicscomic.com/2011/09/21/jimmy-fallon-and-dana-carvey-trade-impersonations-for-an-evening|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also musically inclined, and started playing guitar at age 13. He would go on to perform comedy and music in contests and shows.&lt;ref name="Allmusic"/&gt; By his junior high years, he was labeled a class clown, to his teachers' dismay, but was also described as "nice and well-mannered".&lt;ref name="usa04"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/people/2004-10-07-fallon_x.htm |work=[[USA Today]]|title=Jimmy Fallon's pleasant tomorrow|date=October 7, 2004|author=Gary Strauss|accessdate=May 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[Saugerties High School]], from which he graduated in 1992, he was a performer in most stage productions, and was twice a class social director.&lt;ref name="usa04"/&gt; He won a young comedian's contest with an impression of [[Pee-wee Herman]].&lt;ref name="spin00"&gt;{{cite book|author=Judd Bloch|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t_SxSP63d7cC&amp;pg=PA137&amp;dq=jimmy+fallon&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=EILvVKavIsq8ggSatILQAQ&amp;ved=0CFYQ6AEwCTgU#v=onepage&amp;q=jimmy%20fallon&amp;f=false|title=Saturday Night Special|publisher=''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]''|pages=136–138|volume=16|issue=11 |date=November 2000|accessdate=February 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then attended [[The College of Saint Rose]] in [[Albany, New York]], where he was first a [[computer science]] major, later switching to communications in his senior year. In May 2009, 14 years after he left college a semester early to pursue a comedy career, he returned to receive his Bachelor of Arts in communications. He was a double headliner that day at the [[Saratoga Performing Arts Center]], earning an honorary degree reflecting his achievements and then joining classmates to collect his degree. St. Rose awarded Fallon his diploma after he earned experiential learning credits through a portfolio review of his television work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.strose.edu/good-to-know-jimmy-fallon-09-saint-rose-was-his-muse/|title=Good to Know: Jimmy Fallon '09, Saint Rose was his muse|date=February 13, 2014|website=Blogs.strose.edu |accessdate=September 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was an average student, often taking stand-up gigs on the weekends.&lt;ref name="VF"/&gt; Fallon would often board buses from his aunt's in Fort Hamilton to Caroline's comedy club in [[Times Square]] to perform sets.&lt;ref name="vul2014"/&gt;

==Career==
===Comedy beginnings===
Fallon dropped out of The College of Saint Rose a semester shy of a degree in 1995 to move to [[Los Angeles]] and pursue comedy full-time.&lt;ref name="UPI.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/2009/05/09/Jimmy-Fallon-gets-belated-BA/UPI-84721241913501/|title= Jimmy Fallon gets belated B.A.|date=April 9, 2009|agency=United Press International|accessdate=February 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He secured a manager and got bookings by the age of 21.{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=132}} He often did stand-up at the Improv, earning $7.50 per set,&lt;ref name="NYMagazine"/&gt; and he joined classes with the Groundlings, an improv comedy troupe.&lt;ref name="usa04"/&gt; He appeared in the feature film ''The Scheme'' (originally entitled ''The Entrepreneurs''). His one line in ''Father's Day'' was cut, but he can still be seen in the background. In 1998, Fallon appeared briefly on the show ''[[Spin City]]'' in the second season as a man selling photographs.&lt;ref name="Fame10Fallon"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sheldon|first1=James|title=10 Things You Didn't Know About Jimmy Fallon|url=https://www.fame10.com/entertainment/10-things-you-didnt-know-about-jimmy-fallon/|accessdate=April 2, 2018|work=Fame10|date=November 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He remained fixated on joining ''Saturday Night Live''. After two years of working with the Groundlings,&lt;ref name="paper"&gt;{{cite news|title=A Man for All Reasons: Jimmy Fallon |url=http://www.papermag.com/2001/11/a_man_for_all_reasons_jimmy_fallon.php|date=November 1, 2001 |author=Jonathan Durbin|work=[[Paper (magazine)|Paper]]|accessdate=February 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; he auditioned for the program in 1997, but was unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="usa04"/&gt; When he was cast in a [[pilot episode|pilot presentation]] for [[The WB]], Fallon made sure to include a clause in his contract specifying that if he were to join ''SNL'' he would be released from his contract.&lt;ref name=rs/&gt; His manager sent videotapes to Marci Klein and Ayala Cohen, producers for ''SNL''.&lt;ref name="nytaudition"/&gt;

{{quote|This was my ultimate goal. If I ever cut into a birthday cake and made a wish, I would wish to be on ''SNL''. If I threw a coin into a fountain, I would wish to be on ''SNL''. If I saw a shooting star, I would wish to be on ''SNL''.&lt;ref name="nytaudition"/&gt; [...] I remember saying to myself, 'If I don't make it on [the show] before I'm 25, I'm going to kill myself.' It's crazy. I had no other plan. I didn't have friends, I didn't have a girlfriend, I didn't have anything going on. I had my career, that was it.&lt;ref name=rs/&gt;}}

Fallon landed his second audition at the age of 23. At the "notoriously difficult audition,"&lt;ref name="VF1"/&gt; he was told by multiple individuals that creator [[Lorne Michaels]] almost never emitted laughter during auditions. Although he initially feared the comic before him, armed with an arsenal of props, would outshine him, Fallon went onstage and did well.&lt;ref name="nytaudition"/&gt; He showcased his impressions with a celebrity walk-a-thon, including impressions of [[Jerry Seinfeld]], [[Chris Rock]], [[Bill Cosby]], and [[Adam Sandler]], an ''SNL'' alumnus who had recently left the show.&lt;ref&gt;Brady, Shirley, et al. "JIMMY FALLON". ''People'' (July 10, 2000). ''54'' (2):78&lt;/ref&gt; The latter received laughter from the room, including Michaels.&lt;ref name="people"&gt;{{cite news|title=Jimmy Fallon and More SNL Stars Share Their Scary Audition Stories|url=http://www.people.com/article/jimmy-fallon-saturday-night-live-audition-story|date=February 4, 2015|author=Janine Rayford Rubenstein|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]|accessdate=February 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Head writer [[Tina Fey]], who was in the room, later said "He's one of two people I've ever seen who was completely ready to be on the show. [[Kristen Wiig]] is the other one... And Jimmy was ready—like, if there had been a show to do that night."&lt;ref name="VF1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Jimmy Fallon: Lorne Michaels Advised Me on Who to Date (and Not Marry)|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2014/01/jimmy-fallon-lorne-michaels-advised-me-on-who-to-date-and-not-marry|date=January 7, 2014|work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|accessdate=February 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He rushed through his original characters in order to arrive at his musical impressions, which he felt were stronger. Three weeks passed, and despite his feeling that he had not gotten the position, he was asked to meet with Michaels at the [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] lot in Los Angeles. Michaels informed him that they wanted him for the show, and Fallon characterized the moment as being in "slow motion," remarking to Michaels before he left, "I'm going to make you proud."&lt;ref name="nytaudition"&gt;{{cite news|title=Extended Interview with Jimmy Fallon |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/25/arts/television/jimmy-fallon-snl-audition-interview.html |date=August 22, 2013|author=Dave Itzkoff|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=February 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Saturday Night Live'' years===
====Early seasons (1998–2000)====
Fallon debuted on ''Saturday Night Live'' as a featured player at the beginning of the show's [[Saturday Night Live (season 24)|twenty-fourth season]] in September 1998.&lt;ref&gt;No byline (August 29, 2002), "Jimmy Fallon is here on MTV, there on 'SNL' and ...". ''USA Today''.&lt;/ref&gt; He became a star by his fourth episode, when he performed [[Halloween]]-themed versions of songs by popular artists, as well as his Sandler impression.&lt;ref name=rs/&gt; His sudden popularity made Fallon a celebrity, where he was considered charming. Fallon possessed a strong female fan-base, receiving numerous letters from fans and becoming the subject of numerous fan-sites.&lt;ref name="NYMagazine"/&gt; He became the program's most featured mimic, with popular impressions of [[Robert De Niro]], Jerry Seinfeld, and [[Howard Stern]]. In addition, he also starred as many original characters, including [[Nick Burns (character)|Nick Burns]], an [[IT Support]] nerd, Pat "Sully" Sullivan, one of the [[The Boston Teens|Boston Teens]] with [[Rachel Dratch]], and in [[Recurring Saturday Night Live characters and sketches introduced 2000–2001#Jarret's Room|Jarret's Room]], a fictional [[webcast]] hosted by [[Stoner (drug user)|stoner]] college students Jarret (Fallon) and Gobi ([[Horatio Sanz]]). He was promoted to repertory player in his second season.&lt;ref name="NYMagazine"/&gt;

In his off time, Fallon released a book comprising e-mail exchanges with his sister, titled ''I Hate This Place: A Pessimist's Guide to Life'' (1999), and filmed a minor role for the film ''[[Almost Famous]]'' (2000).&lt;ref name="NYMagazine"/&gt; During their time at ''SNL'', Fallon and [[Horatio Sanz]] often drank together. Sanz has described Fallon and himself as "super-functioning alcoholics," and stated, "They say that kind of goes hand in hand with ''SNL'', some kind of substance-abuse issues, because it's so stressful you easily find yourself blowing off steam a lot."&lt;ref name="vul2014"/&gt; For example, on one occasion, they spent a Friday night watching [[The Strokes]] perform a midnight show, staying up until the early morning drinking, despite having to do ''SNL'' that night.&lt;ref name="39vul"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vulture.com/2014/02/jimmy-fallon-tonight-show-host-hang-out-things-you-learn.html|title=39 Things You Learn About Jimmy Fallon by Hanging Out With Him|author= Jada Yuan|date=February 18, 2014|website=[[Vulture (blog)|Vulture]]|publisher=''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]''|accessdate=May 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; "We actually took what we thought being on SNL was, what people think is awesome about it, and we made it happen," said Sanz,&lt;ref name="39vul"/&gt; who noted that he and Fallon got in more than a few bar fights.&lt;ref name="vul2014"/&gt;

====Later years (2001–04)====
Fallon initially envisioned he would spend three years at ''SNL'', like Belushi, but he was persuaded to stay on for an additional three when given the reins to [[Weekend Update]] (which he would co-host with writer [[Tina Fey]]).&lt;ref name="vul2014"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vulture.com/2014/01/jimmy-fallon-tonight-show-interview.html|title=Last Night With Jimmy Fallon: Into the Wee Hours With the Heir to TV's Grandest Franchise|author= Jada Yuan|date=February 2, 2014|website=[[Vulture (blog)|Vulture]]|publisher=''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]''|accessdate=May 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wolk, Josh (October 13, 2000), "2 'LIVE' CREW". ''Entertainment Weekly''. (563):11&lt;/ref&gt; His co-hosting of Weekend Update increased his profile even more.&lt;ref name="spin02"/&gt; During this tenure, he formed a close relationship with Michaels, whom he'd consult with on anything from dating to career advice.&lt;ref name="VF1"/&gt; Fallon called a December 2001 sketch in which he imitates [[Rolling Stones]] frontman [[Mick Jagger]] in a mirror opposite Jagger his favorite thing he had done up to that point.&lt;ref name="spin02"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sia Michel|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w8s9P_S6njMC&amp;pg=PA72&amp;dq=jimmy+fallon&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_4HvVICUK4qXgwT6y4HwCg&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=jimmy%20fallon&amp;f=false|title=Fallon Comes Alive|publisher=''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]''|pages=70–76|volume=18|issue=3|date=March 2002 |accessdate=February 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his later years on ''SNL'', Fallon co-starred in skit titled ''[[The Barry Gibb Talk Show]]'' alongside musician [[Justin Timberlake]], where the duo portrayed [[Bee Gees]] brothers [[Barry Gibb|Barry]] and [[Robin Gibb]]. It marked the beginning of a long-running friendship and collaboration with Timberlake.&lt;ref name="timberlake"&gt;{{cite news|title=History of a Bromance: Jimmy Fallon and Justin Timberlake|url=https://www.gq.com/blogs/the-feed/2013/12/jimmy-fallon-justin-timberlake-bromance.html|date=December 20, 2013|author=Tara Wanda Merrigan|work=[[GQ (magazine)|GQ]]|accessdate=February 25, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210021804/http://www.gq.com/blogs/the-feed/2013/12/jimmy-fallon-justin-timberlake-bromance.html|archivedate=February 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fallon became well known for his tendency to [[break character]] in sketches, an attribute he himself, as well as Michaels, disliked.&lt;ref name="GQ"/&gt; It began in the infamous "[[More cowbell]]" sketch, when [[Will Ferrell]] wore a tighter shirt than expected, causing Fallon to crack up. Following this, other cast members would intentionally try to get Fallon to break.&lt;ref name=rs/&gt; Other cast members believed he was attempting to steal the moment, to make the sketch about himself. The joke became near-constant during Fallon's final year on the show.&lt;ref name=rs/&gt; During this time, Fallon parlayed his ''SNL'' success into co-hosting the [[2001 MTV Movie Awards]]&lt;ref&gt;Souter, Ericka (June 11, 2001), "talking with...Jimmy Fallon".

===Movie career (2004–08)===
Fallon began to pursue a movie career beginning in 2004. He had spurned most major roles due to lack of time and disinterest in the dozens of scripts he read.&lt;ref name="usa04"/&gt; He signed on for his first lead role in ''[[Taxi (2004 film)|Taxi]]'', a remake of a French film. Fallon had read the script in the prior years but became more interested when co-star [[Queen Latifah]] became attached to the project. He was also attracted to the film's [[action comedy]] tone, seeing comparisons with ''SNL'' alumnus [[Eddie Murphy]]'s first big film, ''[[48 Hrs.]]'' (1982).&lt;ref name="IGN"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2004/10/07/interview-jimmy-fallon |title=Interview: Jimmy Fallon|author=Steve Head|date=October 7, 2004|publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=May 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He split his time in the fall of 2003 between shooting the film in Los Angeles and returning to New York City for ''SNL''.&lt;ref name="usa04"/&gt; Due to these conflicts (and his contract ending), his sixth season at ''SNL'' was his final, with Fallon signing off at the conclusion of the show's [[Saturday Night Live (season 29)|twenty-ninth season]] in May 2004.&lt;ref name="people1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Jimmy Fallon Signs Off from SNL For Good|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,638549,00.html|date=May 17, 2004|author=Stephen M. Silverman|work=[[People (magazine)|People]] |accessdate=February 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Jimmy Fallon by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|left|Fallon in 2007]]

With big expectations from the studio, ''Taxi'' premiered in the fall of 2004 and was a flop with critics and audiences, resulting in Fallon's first failure.&lt;ref name=rs/&gt; [[20th Century Fox]] had already signed him on for his second major role, starring opposite [[Drew Barrymore]] in the 2005 [[romantic comedy]] ''[[Fever Pitch (2005 film)|Fever Pitch]]''.&lt;ref name="usa04"/&gt; ''Fever Pitch'' did not fare much better than ''Taxi'', receiving mild reviews and tepid box office returns.&lt;ref name="ew"/&gt; He met his wife, producer Nancy Juvonen, during production of the film and the two wed in December 2007.

Film offers decreased, with his two chances for major films both considered failures. Subsequently, Fallon went through what he has deemed a "lost period," characterized by a larger-than-usual alcohol consumption and confusion over his next career moves.&lt;ref name="VF"/&gt; He wrote a screenplay during this time "about a guy in a goth band who has to pretend to be a country-music star."&lt;ref name=rs/&gt; Following his failure in film, Fallon moved back east to New York, spending "a couple of years aimlessly knocking around."&lt;ref name="vul2014"/&gt;

Prior to leaving ''SNL'', Michaels had mentioned to Fallon that he would be a good fit to take over NBC's ''[[Late Night (NBC)|Late Night]]'' franchise when then-host [[Conan O'Brien]] would depart the show to host the long-running ''[[Tonight Show]]'' in the future. Michaels urged NBC to give Fallon a holding deal in February 2007 so that he couldn't be lured elsewhere.&lt;ref name="ew"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20262336,00.html|title=Jimmy Fallon: The New King of ''Late Night''|author=Tim Stack|date=March 2, 2009|publisher=''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' |accessdate=June 16, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426002207/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0%2C%2C20262336_2%2C00.html|archivedate=April 26, 2009|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To prepare for the role of a late-night host, Fallon toured college campuses and comedy clubs for eight months, where he tested out a new, 50-minute routine.&lt;ref name="ct"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2009-03-02/entertainment/0903010190_1_astral-weeks-talk-tonight-show|title=Jimmy Fallon: Host for a Twittering society|first=Kevin|last=Pang |date=March 2, 2009|publisher=''[[Chicago Tribune]]''|accessdate= 2012-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also began watching the comedy of [[Chevy Chase]], [[Dick Cavett]], and [[Johnny Carson]], as well as ''[[The Larry Sanders Show]]''.&lt;ref name=rs/&gt; In May 2008, Fallon was announced as the successor to O'Brien's ''Late Night''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Greppi|first=Michele|url=http://www.tvweek.com/news/2008/05/jimmy_fallon_headed_to_nbc_lat.php|title=Jimmy Fallon Headed to NBC 'Late Night'|work=TVWeek|accessdate=April 16, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130728163156/http://www.tvweek.com/news/2008/05/jimmy_fallon_headed_to_nbc_lat.php|archive-date=July 28, 2013|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jimmy Fallon to succeed Conan on NBC talk show|work=Los Angeles Times|date=April 25, 2008|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/tv/la-et-fallon-conan-nbc25apr25,1,4145164.story|accessdate=April 25, 2008 |first=Television|last=Critic|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430043258/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/tv/la-et-fallon-conan-nbc25apr25%2C1%2C4145164.story |archivedate=April 30, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,352397,00.html|title=Jimmy Fallon Cinches Conan's Job|date=April 24, 2008|publisher=Fox News Channel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fallon was considered an odd choice for the job, both by executives at NBC (who "hated" the idea and predicted it to be a failure), and among the general public. This was referenced in an early promo for the series: "You loved him on ''SNL''! You hated him in the movies! Now you're ambivalent."&lt;ref name="GQ"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.gq.com/style/wear-it-now/201304/jimmy-fallon-interview-gq-april-2013|title=Jimmy Fallon: The New King of Late Night TV|author= Jeanne Marrie Laskas|date=March 2013|work=[[GQ (magazine)|GQ]]|accessdate=May 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYM"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nymag.com/arts/tv/profiles/69366|title=Mr. Sunshine|author=Adam Sternbergh |date=November 7, 2010|work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|accessdate=May 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Back to television and ''Late Night'' (2009–13)===
[[File:Late Night With Jimmy Fallon, Barack Obama, Memorial Hall, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, April 24, 2012.jpg|thumb|upright|Fallon interviewing President [[Barack Obama]] on the campus of [[UNC at Chapel Hill]] in April 2012, while at the helm of [[Late Night with Jimmy Fallon|his tenure at ''Late Night'']]]]
''[[Late Night with Jimmy Fallon]]'' premiered in March 2009 to mixed reviews. Producer Michael Shoemaker felt that the show's style solidified when it used [[Susan Boyle]] as a joke. While other late-night programs had centered on her appearance, Fallon's ''Late Night'' debuted a sketch in which Boyle's emotional performances could "salve any affliction."&lt;ref name="NYM"/&gt; It was this style of humor, that Adam Sternbergh of ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' dubbed "the comedy of unabashed celebration", that led to the program's success.&lt;ref name="NYM"/&gt;

Fallon proved himself different from other late-night hosts, with more of a reliance on music, dancing, impersonations, and games.&lt;ref name=rs&gt;{{cite journal| author=Brian Hiatt| date =January 20, 2011| title =Jimmy Fallon's Big Adventure|journal=[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]] |issue=1122|publisher=[[Jann Wenner|Wenner Media]] [[Limited liability company|LLC]]|location=New York City|issn=0035-791X|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/jimmy-fallons-big-adventure-20110120|accessdate=May 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between Fallon's own musical sensibilities and the recruitment of his [[house band]], hip-hop collective [[The Roots]], his incarnation of ''Late Night'' "evolved into the most deeply musical of TV's musical-comedy variety programs", with sketches in which he parodies [[Neil Young]] and [[Bruce Springsteen]] going viral online. Coincidentally, it was during the [[2010 Tonight Show conflict|''Tonight Show'' debacle]] that Fallon's show found its footing.&lt;ref name="VF"/&gt;

Another component built into the program was its association with [[social media]] and the Internet. The first majorly successful online clip was of Fallon and [[Justin Timberlake]] performing a "[[History of Rap]]".&lt;ref name="NYM"/&gt; Online interaction and its presence on the show soon became crucial to its success.&lt;ref name="nyt1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/11/arts/television/late-night-tv-shows-face-a-difficult-future.html?_r=1&amp;ref=jimmyfallon |title=No More Desk Potatoes?|first=Bill|last=Carter|date=September 9, 2011|publisher=The ''New York Times''|accessdate=2012-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of August 2013, Fallon was earning a salary of $11 million a year for his work on ''Late Night''.&lt;ref&gt;Battaglio, Stephen; Schneider, Michael (August 26, 2013).

Fallon also hosted the [[62nd Primetime Emmy Awards]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Jimmy-Fallon-Emmys-1018064.aspx|title=Jimmy Fallon to Host Primetime Emmys|work=TV Guide}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2010/08/jimmy-fallon-and-a-host-of-new-winners-keep-emmy-viewership-from-falling.html|work=Los Angeles Times|title=Jimmy Fallon and a host of new winners keep Emmy viewership from falling|date=August 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Fallon released his second comedy album, ''[[Blow Your Pants Off]]'', which compiles many of his musical performances on ''Late Night''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bell|first=Josh|title=Jimmy Fallon Blow Your Pants Off album review |url=http://www.thespittake.com/2012/06/12/jimmy-fallon-blow-your-pants-off-warner-brothers/ |publisher=The Spit Take|accessdate=April 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album won a Grammy in 2013 for [[Best Comedy Album]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americansongwriter.com/2012/06/cover-story-jimmy-fallon-and-the-rise-of-tebowie|title=Cover Story: Jimmy Fallon And The Rise Of Tebowie|work=American Songwriter}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discussions for Fallon to take over ''The Tonight Show'' began in early 2013.&lt;ref name="NYT1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/21/business/media/tonight-show-expected-to-return-to-new-york-with-fallon.html|title=''Tonight'', With New Host, Set to Reclaim Its New York Roots|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|date=March 20, 2013 |author=Bill Carter|accessdate=February 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 15, 2016, Fallon hosted [[Donald Trump]] on ''The Tonight Show'' during the [[United States presidential election, 2016|United States presidential election]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/09/the-embarrassment-of-jimmy-fallon-by-donald-trump/500354/|title=The Embarrassment of Jimmy Fallon by Donald Trump |last=Sims|first=David|date=September 16, 2016|website=The Atlantic|access-date=September 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/elections-2016-late-night-tv-donald-trump-jimmy-fallon-mess-up-hair|title=Donald Trump lets Jimmy Fallon mess up his hair on late-night TV|website=CBS News|access-date=September 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the appearance, Fallon was criticized by some media critics and viewers on social media for the uncontroversial questions he asked of Trump.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/biz/news/donald-trump-jimmy-fallon-1201862191|title=Jimmy Fallon Messes With Donald Trump's Hair in 'Tonight Show' Appearance |last=Johnson|first=Ted|date=September 16, 2016|website=Variety.com|language=en-US|access-date=September 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/twitter-users-criticize-jimmy-fallon-929513|title=Twitter Users Criticize Jimmy Fallon for Not Being Tougher on Donald Trump|last=Konerman|first=Jennifer|date=2016-09-15|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=September 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Sims, writing in ''[[The Atlantic]]'', called the interview an "embarrassment".&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; In response to the criticism, Fallon said to [[TMZ]]: ''"Have you seen my show?

Fallon apologized in March 2017 in the interview, saying "I didn’t do it to humanize him. I almost did it to minimize him. I didn’t think that would be a compliment: "He did the thing that we all wanted to do." Fallon also added 'After this happened, I was devastated. I didn’t mean anything by it.

==Influences==
Fallon told [[David Steinberg]] on the [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] series ''Inside Comedy'' that as a child he and his sister would imitate [[Steve Martin]] and [[Dan Aykroyd]]'s "Wild and Crazy Guys" routines from ''Saturday Night Live'', and that he listened to comedy records, learning to imitate [[Rodney Dangerfield]] from them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sho.com/sho/video/titles/26716/jimmy-fallon|title=Jimmy Fallon|publisher=''[[Inside Comedy]]'' Season 3, Episode 1 (01:19 excerpt)|date=February 3, 2014|accessdate=July 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
