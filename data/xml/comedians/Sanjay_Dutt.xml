'''Sanjay Balraj Dutt''' ([[Urdu]]: سنجے دتّ, [[Hindi]]: संजय दत्त, born 29 July 1959) is an [[Indian film]] actor and producer known for his work in Hindi cinema ([[Bollywood]]). He was educated at [[The Lawrence School, Sanawar]]. The son of veteran Hindi film actors [[Sunil Dutt]] and [[Nargis Dutt]], he made his acting debut in 1981 and has since appeared in more than 187 [[Hindi film]]s. Although Dutt has enjoyed great success as a lead actor in genres ranging from romance to comedy, it has been the roles of gangsters, thugs and police officers in the drama and action genres that have won him much appreciation. The Indian media and audiences alike popularly refer to him as ''Deadly Dutt'' for his larger-than-life portrayals of such characters.

In a film career spanning more than 37 years, Dutt has won two [[Filmfare Awards]], two [[IIFA Awards]], two [[Bollywood Movie Awards]], three [[Screen Awards]], three [[Stardust Awards]], two [[Zee Cine Awards]], and a [[Global Indian Film Awards|Global Indian Film Award]]. Four of his films have won various [[National Film Awards]]. He has won most of his awards for ''[[Vaastav: The Reality]]'', ''[[Mission Kashmir]]'', ''[[Munna Bhai MBBS]]'', and ''[[Lage Raho Munna Bhai]]''. He won three Best Actor awards for ''[[Vaastav: The Reality]]''. 

Dutt was arrested under the [[Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act]] (TADA) in April 1993. Charges of terrorism were dropped but he was convicted of illegal possession of weapons. After serving his sentence with good behaviour and conduct, he was released on 25 February 2016.

==Film career==

===1981–1997===
Dutt made his [[Bollywood]] movie debut with the box office super hit ''[[Rocky (1981 film)|Rocky]]'' in 1981. Dutt then went on to star in ''[[Vidhaata]]'', the highest grossing Hindi film of 1982, along with movies like ''[[Main Awara Hoon]]'' (1983). In 1985 he shot for his first film in three years, ''Jaan ki Baazi'' (1985). ''Jaan ki Baazi'' marked a comeback for Dutt and he appeared in successful films throughout the 80s such as ''Imaandaar'', ''[[Inaam Dus Hazaar]]'', ''[[Jeete Hain Shaan Se]]'' (1988), ''[[Mardon Wali Baat]]'' (1988), ''[[Ilaaka]]'' (1989), ''[[Hum Bhi Insaan Hain (1989 film)|Hum Bhi Insaan Hain]]'' (1989), ''[[Kanoon Apna Apna]]'' (1989), and ''[[Taaqatwar]].''&lt;ref name="indianexpress.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/entertainment-others/sanjay-dutt-on-the-wrong-side-of-the-law/|title=Sanjay Dutt – On the wrong side of the law|date=16 May 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1986 blockbuster ''[[Naam (1986 film)|Naam]]'' was Dutt's first major critical success and a turning point in his career, the film firmly cemented him amongst India's finest young main stream leading actors as he earned praise for his portrayal of an illegal immigrant in Dubai who spirals into a life of crime.&lt;ref&gt;http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/44956266.cms?utm_source=contentofinterest&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=cppst&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thehindu.com/thehindu/2000/12/08/stories/09080221.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/entertainment-others/sanjay-dutt-on-the-wrong-side-of-the-law/&lt;/ref&gt;

His performances in both ''[[Kabzaa]]'' (1988) and [[J. P. Dutta]]'s 1989 ''[[Hathyar (1989 film)|Hathyar]]'' were  both well received by critics although both films only managed average collections at the box office.&lt;ref name="stargold.in"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sanjay received critical acclaim for Kabzaa|url=http://www.stargold.in/newsdetails.aspx?nid=4451|publisher=stargold.in|accessdate=2013-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stargold.in"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sanjay received critical acclaim for Kabzaa And Hathyar|url=http://movies.addatoday.com/2012/05/about-sanjay-dutt-biography.html|publisher=movies.addatoday.com|accessdate=2013-08-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113015447/http://movies.addatoday.com/2012/05/about-sanjay-dutt-biography.html|archive-date=13 November 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sanjay rece|url=http://movies.addatoday.com/2012/05/about-sanjay-dutt-biography.html|publisher=movies.addatoday.com|accessdate=2013-08-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113015447/http://movies.addatoday.com/2012/05/about-sanjay-dutt-biography.html|archive-date=13 November 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the late 1980s he was seen in a number of multi-starrers alongside actors like [[Govinda]], [[Mithun Chakraborty|Mithun]], [[Dharmendra]], [[Jackie Shroff]] and [[Sunny Deol]].&lt;ref name="indianexpress.com"/&gt;

''[[The Hindu]]'' wrote that ''"Sanjay's earlier films (like Naam and Sadak) got him a lot of favourable attention."'' and "Saajan'' established Sanjay Dutt as the conventional soft hero."''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thehindu.com/thehindu/2000/12/08/stories/09080221.htm&lt;/ref&gt;''[[Saajan]]'' was the highest-grossing [[Bollywood films of 1991#Highest grossing|Bollywood film of 1991]], and [[Sadak]] was the sixth highest grosser of 1991.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20130115230117/http://boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=197&amp;catName=MTk5MQ==&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Khal Nayak]]'' was a box office success.

==Controversies==

===1993–2006===
Bombay (now  Mumbai) suffered a series of [[1993 Bombay bombings|serial bombings in 1993]]. Dutt was among several people associated with Bollywood who were accused of involvement. It was alleged that Dutt accepted a delivery of weapons at his house from [[Abu Salem]] and co-accused Riyaz Siddiqui, who had also been implicated in relation to the Mumbai blasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=174294 |title=Charges framed against Salem|publisher=Indian Express|accessdate=2009-04-19|date=18 March 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090829173254/http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=174294 |archivedate=29 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was claimed that the weapons formed a part of a large consignment of arms connected to the terrorists.&lt;ref name="ibn" /&gt; Dutt however in his confession stated that he took only one AK-56 from the producers of his movie Sanam, for his own family protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.news18.com/news/india/1993-mumbai-blasts-sanjay-dutts-confessional-statement-598327.html|title=1993 Mumbai blasts: Sanjay Dutt's confessional statement|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been reported that Sanjay Dutt's father [[Sunil Dutt]]'s political rivalry caused Sanjay Dutt's conviction.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/reel-vs-real-the-politics-behind-the-life-and-crimes-of-sanjay-dutt-118070900115_1.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Re-imprisonment and release===
In March 2013 the Supreme Court upheld Dutt's five-year sentence, 18 months of which he already spent in jail during the trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/sanjay-dutt-convicted-in-1993-bombay-blasts-case-gets-5-years-in-jail-345095?pfrom=home-lateststories |title=Sanjay Dutt convicted in 1993 Bombay blasts case, gets 5 years in jail |publisher=NDTV.com |date=2013-03-21 |accessdate=2013-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was given four weeks to surrender to the authorities, the court having refused to release him on probation due to the severity of the offence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sanjay Dutt given 4 Weeks to surrender |url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/sc-grants-4-weeks-more-to-Sanjay-Dutt-to-surrender/article4627135.ece|publisher=hindubusinessline.com|accessdate=2013-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
