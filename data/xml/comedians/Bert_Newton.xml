'''Bert Newton''', [[Member of the Order of Australia|AM]], [[Member of the Order of the British Empire|MBE]] (born, '''Albert Watson Newton''' 23 July 1938), is an Australian media personality. He is a [[Logie Hall of Fame]] inductee, quadruple [[Gold Logie Award for Best Personality on Australian Television|Gold Logie]] award-winning entertainer and radio, theatre and television personality/presenter. Newton has hosted the Logie Awards ceremony on numerous occasions through his career. He is known for his collaborations with [[Graham Kennedy]] and [[Don Lane]].

Newton started in radio broadcasting, before becoming a star and fixture of Australian television since its inception in 1956, and is considered both an industry pioneer, icon and one of the longest-serving television performers in the world. Newton is known for his association with both the [[Nine Network]] and [[Ten Network]], in numerous shows including: ''[[In Melbourne Tonight]]'', ''[[New Faces (Australian talent show)|New Faces]]'', ''[[Good Morning Australia (1992-2005)|Good Morning Australia]]'', ''[[20 to 1]]'' and  ''[[Bert's Family Feud]]''.

In 2018, he was honoured by [[Australia Post]], along with [[Ray Martin (television presenter)|Ray Martin]], [[Denise Drysdale]], [[Daryl Somers]] and [[Kerri-Anne Kennerley]], by having his portrait featured on a series of stamps, honouring "The Legends of Television"&lt;ref name=site&gt;{{cite web|url=https://shop.auspost.com.au/stamp-and-coin-collectables/stamp-issues/australian-legends-2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newton's wife is singer and television personality [[Patti McGrath|Patti McGrath Newton]]. Their two children are Australian actor [[Matthew Newton]] and television personality Lauren Newton&lt;br /&gt;

==Early life==
Newton was born in [[Fitzroy, Victoria|Fitzroy]], an inner suburb of [[Melbourne]], Australia. He had three brothers (Tom, Jack and Bob) and a sister (Alice). He was educated at [[Samaritan Catholic College#History|St Joseph's]] [[Marist Brothers]] Roman Catholic college. In his early years he had thoughts of entering the priesthood and is still an active [[Roman Catholic]].

==Radio==
Newton's first paid radio appearance was as a schoolboy on Melbourne radio station [[3XY]] on 10 June 1952, doing advertisements dressed as a clown with Doug McKenzie, later to become "Zag" in [[Zig and Zag (Australian performers)|Zig and Zag]].

{{quotation|"...&amp;nbsp;there was a radio program on 3XY Melbourne called Scouting Around, compered by the late Tom Jones. One week the broadcast was recorded at our Scout Hall, and as the direct result of this, I began to appear on 3XY."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.televisionau.com/bertnewton.htm Bert Newton: 50 years on TV. TelevisionAU 7 July 2007 | Retrieved 30 March 2013 ]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This led to regular appearances on a Saturday morning children's show, in which he worked with [[Stan Rofe]] and McKenzie.

In May 1954, 3XY employed him as a junior announcer (aged 15); by 1955 he was presenting ''Melbourne Speaks'', a [[vox populi|vox pop]] program recorded on the streets of Melbourne's CBD.

After GTV-9 purchased [[3AK]] in April 1961, all GTV-9 personalities were expected to present programs on 3AK. Graham Kennedy and Newton hosted a two-hour morning program.

He began a morning program on [[3UZ]] in 1976. The Herald and Weekly Times Ltd appointed Newton as general manager of [[Mix 101.1|3DB]] in 1986, which he combined with on-air appearances until 1988.

==Television==

=== Early television career ===
Newton began his television career at Melbourne's [[Seven Network|HSV-7]], hosting ''[[The Late Show (1950s Australian TV series)|The Late Show]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | first = Graeme
 | last = Blundell

&lt;!--[[File:G kennedy and b newton.jpg|180px|thumb|A young Bert Newton (right), with Graham Kennedy during an episode of ''[[In Melbourne Tonight]]''.]]--&gt;
Newton left HSV-7 and went to [[Nine Network|GTV-9]] in early 1959 to host a daytime television program ''In Melbourne Today''.&lt;ref&gt;Blundell, Graeme: op. cit., p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; After appearing in a live commercial on ''[[In Melbourne Tonight]]'' with his friend [[Graham Kennedy]] at Easter 1959, he began to make regular appearances on the show and assumed hosting duties on some episodes. This began a lifelong association with Kennedy.

In 1959–1960 he hosted ''[[The Bert Newton Show]]'' (later re-titled ''Hi-Fi Club'') on GTV-9, a series aimed at teenagers.

In 1960 and 1961, Newton, along with Graham Kennedy, appeared in the national ''Graham Kennedy's Channel 9 Show'' (a one-night-a-week national version of ''IMT''). In January 1962, the show was cancelled and replaced by the similar ''The Channel 9 Show'', hosted by Newton.&lt;ref&gt;Blundell, Graeme: op. cit., p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television career 1975 to mid-1992===
Newton mainly appeared on the [[Nine Network]] in these years. He appeared on:

* ''[[The Don Lane Show]]'': Starting in 1975, [[Don Lane]] hosted his own variety show, ''[[The Don Lane Show]]'', on [[Nine Network|Channel 9]]. Newton was cast in the role of sidekick and "barrel boy". Newton was dubbed "Moonface" on the show, and the nickname stuck. On the show Newton would frequently appear in outlandish costumes, often sending up celebrities. One of the most memorable events on the show was when Newton sent-up [[Demis Roussos]], and Roussos was sent on to the set while Newton was doing the [[impersonation]]. Newton remained on the show until it ended in 1983.
* ''[[The Bert Newton Show]]'': Newton briefly hosted his own program, ''The Bert Newton Show'', recorded in Sydney for the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]]. It was not a success, and he returned to working with Kennedy.
* ''[[New Faces (Australian talent show)|New Faces]]'': In 1976, Newton replaced long-running compere [[Frank Wilson (Australian actor)|Frank Wilson]] on the Nine Network's amateur talent program ''New Faces''. The show was a success, and lasted until 1985. In 1992, Newton hosted another version of ''New Faces''; however, it did not last for long.
* ''[[Ford Superquiz]]'': In 1981, Newton (and wife Patti) presented a quiz show, ''Ford Superquiz'', produced by the [[Reg Grundy]] organisation for the [[Nine Network]].
* ''[[Tonight With Bert Newton]]'': ''Tonight With Bert Newton'', for the Nine Network, was a short-lived attempt to bring back the spirit of IMT. It aired in 1984.
* ''[[The Bert Newton Show]]'': This was done for the [[Seven Network]] in 1989 as an attempt to woo some of the audience away from ''[[The Midday Show]]'' with [[Ray Martin (television presenter)|Ray Martin]]. This, however, didn't work and was only on air for that year. It started out lasting one hour with a [[soap opera|soapie]] following it called ''[[The Power, The Passion]]'' (which was an early role for [[Julian McMahon]]) but when that got [[axed]] the show was expanded to an hour and a half.

===Move to Network Ten (1992–2005)===
From mid-1992 until 2005, Newton appeared on Channel Ten as host of ''[[Good Morning Australia (1992–2005)|Good Morning Australia]]''
* ''[[Good Morning Australia (1992–2005)|Good Morning Australia]]'': In 1992 Newton moved into daytime television as host of ''The Morning Show'', which soon changed title to ''[[Good Morning Australia (1992–2005)|Good Morning Australia]]'' (GMA) on [[Network Ten]]. The show revived Newton's celebrity status and was a continuing success for Ten. GMA was a mix of interviews, music, cooking segments featuring Newton's floor manager [[Robert Mascara]], aka "Belvedere", doing the popular taste tests and innuendo which was primarily ad-libbed. Much of the screen time was dedicated to [[infomercials]]. Unusually for television, the show was broadcast live-to-air on Mondays and Tuesdays but for the rest of the week live-to-tape (recorded complete and aired later).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/10/22/1034561493452.html "The cult of Bert"], ''Sydney Morning Herald'', 23 October 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2005, Network Ten announced that the program would be cancelled at the end of the year after a 14-year run. Although Newton was offered ongoing employment at Network Ten, he stated that he would return to the Nine Network in 2006.

===Return to the Nine Network (2006–2012)===
After finishing on Network Ten's ''Good Morning Australia'' in late 2005, Newton returned to the Nine Network in early 2006. He appeared on:

* ''[[Bert's Family Feud]]'': In 2006, Newton returned to the [[Nine Network]] and hosted ''[[Bert's Family Feud]]'', a revised version of ''[[Family Feud]]'' in 2006 and until cancelled on 8 May 2007. 
* ''[[20 to 1]]'': From 2006 until 2011, Newton hosted ''[[20 to 1]]'' taking over from [[Bud Tingwell]].
* ''[[What a Year]]'': In 2007, Newton hosted retrospective program ''[[What a Year]]'' with comedian [[Julia Zemiro]], replacing previous hosts [[Mike Munro]] and [[Megan Gale]] which took a light-hearted look at significant events from a chosen year in history.
* ''[[Millionaire Hot Seat]]'': On 14 August 2012, Newton appeared as a celebrity contestant on ''[[Millionaire Hot Seat]]'' and won $5,000 for charity Sids &amp; Kids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/tv-and-radio/bert-still-has-the-passion-20120812-242nl.html//Default.aspx|title=Bert still has the passion|date=13 August 2012|publisher=Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=14 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newton reputedly received a yearly salary of A$800,000 from Nine during this era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/story/0,28383,26024319-10229,00.html | work=Herald Sun | title=Channel Nine stars' salaries to be slashed | first1=Colin | last1=Vickery | first2=Darren | last2=Devlyn | date=4 September 2009 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090905010127/http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/story/0%2C28383%2C26024319-10229%2C00.html | archivedate=5 September 2009 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2008, it was announced that he would be taking over the role of [[Wizard of Oz (character)|The Wizard]] in the Melbourne production of the musical ''[[Wicked (musical)|Wicked]]'', after the sudden death of [[Rob Guest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wickedthemusical.com.au/wicked/News/NewsStory.aspx?id%3D111 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=13 November 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318070336/http://www.wickedthemusical.com.au/wicked/News/NewsStory.aspx?id=111 |archivedate=18 March 2009  }}&lt;/ref&gt; He played his first performance on 12 November 2008. The production closed on 9 August 2009 and transferred to Sydney from 12 September 2009. Newton continued to play the role on the national tour, which began in January 2011, opposite [[Lucy Durack]] as Glinda, [[Jemma Rix]] as Elphaba, [[David Harris (Australian actor)|David Harris]] as Fiyero and [[Maggie Kirkpatrick]] as Madame Morrible. In 2011 he was part of the Australian cast performing ''Wicked'' in Singapore. Altogether Newton had a three-year run in this show.

In July 2012 Newton joined the Melbourne cast of ''[[Annie (musical)|Annie]]'' for a few weeks, taking over the role of President Roosevelt from [[Alan Jones (radio broadcaster)|Alan Jones]].

==Logies==
Newton has been a part of the [[Logie Award]]s since the awards started in 1959. He has been nominated for many Logie Awards and has won several:

Awards won: 
*  Four [[Gold Logie Award for Most Popular Personality on Australian Television|Gold Logie]]s: 1979, 1981, 1982, 1984 (for his roles in [[Don Lane|The Don Lane Show]] and [[New Faces (Australian talent show)|New Faces]])
* Hall of Fame: 1988
* Three 'Best Compere' awards: 1972, 1973, 1974 (for his role in [[In Melbourne Tonight]] and [[The Graham Kennedy Show]])

Awards nominated: 
* [[Gold Logie]]: 1978 (for [[Don Lane|The Don Lane Show]]); 1983 (for The Don Lane Show and [[New Faces (Australian talent show)|New Faces]]), 2006 (for [[Good Morning Australia (1992–2005)|Good Morning Australia]]) and 2007 (for [[20 to 1]] and [[Bert's Family Feud]]).
* Most Popular Light Entertainment Personality: 1993 (for his role in [[Good Morning Australia (1992–2005)|Good Morning Australia]])

Newton has also hosted the Logies (1968–1980, 1982, 1984, 1989, 1993 and 2010, and co-host in 2006). He holds the record for both the most Logies hosted and the most Logies hosted in a continuous run. Some notable moments of his hosting include:

* At the 1979 Logies awards Newton said to [[Muhammad Ali]] "I like the [[wikt:boy#Noun|boy]]", not knowing that "boy" could be taken as a racial slur. Ali responded "Did he call me Roy?" and members of the audience, including Don Lane, shouted to Newton to say "Yes, Roy". Newton looked puzzled and later explained to the media that he did not realise that "boy" was used as a racial slur. Ali at least realised Newton's use was unintended and they kissed and made up.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|xWKyDGGptA4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.theage.com.au/lifestyle/the-social-kiss-plain-cheek-or-what-20120126-1qis6.html?rand=1327636086497 | title = The social kiss: plain cheek or what?  | last1 = Gardnier | first1 = Stephanie | newspaper = The Age | publisher = Fairfax | date = 29 January 2012 | accessdate = 29 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Newton also made light of the incident by saying: "I'll  change my name, my religion ... anything.", referring to Ali's change of name from [[Cassius Clay]] when he adopted [[Islam]] in 1964.
* In 1973, American actor [[Michael Cole (actor)|Michael Cole]], best known for his role in the TV series ''[[The Mod Squad]]'', accepted an award while obviously drunk and ended his barely coherent thank-you speech with the word "shit",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blundell|first1=Graham|title=Bert|date=2014|publisher=Hachette Australia|location=Sydney|isbn=9780733631641|page=165|edition=First}}&lt;/ref&gt; to which Newton, after a classic pause, merely added 'congratulations'.
* In 2006, after the awards, he had a fall and injured himself. The injury was visible for a number of ''Bert's Family Feud'' episodes.
