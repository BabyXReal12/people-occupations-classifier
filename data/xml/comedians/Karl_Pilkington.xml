'''Karl Pilkington''' (born 23 September 1972) is an English television presenter, author, comedian, radio producer, actor, and voice actor.

Pilkington gained prominence as the producer of [[Ricky Gervais]] and [[Stephen Merchant]]'s radio programme on [[XFM]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/arts/tv-radio/article2476500.ece |title=

Pilkington is a co-founder, along with Gervais and Merchant, of RiSK Productions, a television production company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/news/broadcasters/idiot-abroad-3-in-pre-production/5038753.article |title=Idiot Abroad 3 in pre-production|publisher=''[[Broadcast (magazine)|Broadcast]]'' |date=2 March 2012 |accessdate=29 September 2013|quote=Gervais set up Risk Productions along with Stephen Merchant and Karl Pilkington to make the second series following the success of the first Mentorn Media-produced series.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2011/02/02/12680/the_idiot_is_back... |title=The 'idiot' is back... |publisher=Chortle |date=2 February 2011 |accessdate=29 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pilkington also starred in the [[Sky 1]] travel documentary comedy series ''[[The Moaning of Life]]'' (2013–2015). This is his first show to not have any involvement from either Gervais or Merchant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.wanderlust.co.uk/magazine/articles/interviews/karl-pilkington-on-the-moaning-of-life |title=Karl Pilkington on The Moaning of Life |website=wanderlust.co.uk |date= |author-last=Moore |author-first=Peter|accessdate=11 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pilkington is currently working on a new scripted comedy series, ''[[Sick of It (TV series)|Sick of It]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2017-09-20/sky-1-to-take-edgy-new-comedy-route-with-scripted-shows-from-karl-pilkington-and-romesh-ranganathan/|title=Sky 1 to take "edgy" new comedy route with scripted shows from Karl Pilkington and Romesh Ranganathan|work=Radio Times|access-date=2017-11-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Pilkington was born on 23 September 1972 in [[Manchester]]. Pilkington grew up on a Manchester council estate, along with his siblings. He attended Cecil Avenue Comprehensive School. &lt;ref&gt;

==Career==

===Early work===
Pilkington moved to London from Manchester to work with [[XFM London|XFM]] as a producer.  While there, he unintentionally caused [[Gail Porter]] to leave the station in tears after only one show; he criticised her performance, which Pilkington says was an attempt to encourage improvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.absoluteradio.co.uk/player/Christian-O-Connell-Breakfast-Show/8302/Karl-Pilkington--Ricky-Gervais-and-Stephen-Merchant-Conned-Me-Into-TV-Show.html |title=Karl Pilkington: Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant Conned Me Into TV Show - On The Christian O'Connell Breakfast Show - Video |publisher=Absolute Radio |date= |accessdate=26 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002183231/http://www.absoluteradio.co.uk/player/Christian-O-Connell-Breakfast-Show/8302/Karl-Pilkington--Ricky-Gervais-and-Stephen-Merchant-Conned-Me-Into-TV-Show.html |archivedate= 2 October 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After several years he began work on ''[[The Ricky Gervais Show]]''. Initially, Pilkington was solely the programme's producer. As Gervais and Merchant began to invite him to make the odd comment, Pilkington's persona came to light and his popularity increased. Pilkington was eventually included as a main element of the broadcasts, with large amounts of airtime often given over to his thoughts on various subjects, or various childhood stories. In December 2005, Pilkington stood in for two [[BBC 6 Music]] shows for [[Nemone]], and co-presented the shows with [[Russell Brand]].

===Celebrity===
Pilkington's presence on ''[[The Ricky Gervais Show]]'' podcasts significantly increased his popularity. He has often been mentioned in interviews given by Gervais, and is often the butt of Gervais' [[practical jokes]]. After saying "I could eat a knob at night" on the podcast (in relation to ''[[I'm a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here!|I'm a Celebrity]]'' contestants [[I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! (UK TV series)#Bushtucker trial|eating a kangaroo penis]]), Gervais encouraged his listeners to sample the [[sound bite]] and mix it into [[dance music]]. The phrase spawned several dance music mixes, T-shirts, and other merchandise. Many of Pilkington's quotes have since gained publicity, particularly on the Internet. [[Reuters]], commenting on this issue, described Pilkington as a "phenomenon" who had made "Internet history".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=August 2004 |url=http://www.rickygervais.com/karlisacult.php |title=Ricky Gervais... Obviously |publisher=Rickygervais.com |accessdate=12 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 November 2010, while appearing live on [[Richard Bacon (TV presenter)|Richard Bacon]]'s [[BBC Radio 5 Live|Radio 5 Live]] afternoon show, Gervais surprised Pilkington with an on-air phone call. This led to a conversation where Pilkington, who claimed to have been interrupted while [[grout]]ing his kitchen, said he had not yet been paid for his work on ''An Idiot Abroad'' and concluded the interview with an off-the-cuff link into the hourly news.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-11815230 | work=BBC News | title=Ricky Gervais makes a surprise call to Karl Pilkington | date=22 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pilkington has worked independently of Gervais and Merchant on several projects. He appeared as a guest on the shows ''[[Flipside TV]]'' and ''[[The Culture Show]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rlslog.net/the-culture-show-s08e03-ws-pdtv-xvid-remax/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080204012546/http://www.rlslog.net/the-culture-show-s08e03-ws-pdtv-xvid-remax/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=4 February 2008 |title=Releaselog &amp;#124; RLSLOG.net » The Culture Show S08E03 WS PDTV XviD-REMAX |publisher=RLSLOG.net |date= |accessdate=18 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and appeared in several short films as part of the [[Channel 4]] project ''3 Minute Wonders''.

Merchant and Gervais have repeatedly denied claims that Pilkington's comic persona is their creation. In an on-air response to similar claims made by Chris Campling during a broadcast on XFM, Merchant stated that he would be "ashamed" if the radio show was scripted, and added that "I would not have squandered a character that good on this poxy radio station".&lt;ref&gt;Pilkington, K. (Producer) &amp; Merchant, S., Gervais, R. (Presenters). (June 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Gervais concurred, pointing out that writing a single series' worth of six half-hour episodes of shows such as ''The Office'' and ''Extras'' took the two of them up to a year. An interviewer for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' concluded that Pilkington's persona is genuine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3655386/The-idiot-philosopher.html |title=The idiot philosopher|publisher= ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''| accessdate=28 May 2012 | date=17 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television and DVD===
Pilkington appeared in an interview on Ricky Gervais's live stand-up comedy DVD, ''[[Politics (comedy)|Politics]]''. The DVD of Gervais's film ''[[The Invention of Lying]]'' contains a special feature called ''Meet Karl Pilkington''&lt;ref name="ign"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.ign.com/articles/2009/12/02/invention-of-lying-comes-clean| title=Invention of Lying Comes Clean – Ricky Gervais and Jennifer Garner gracing DVD and Blu-ray.| work=IGN.com| date=2 December 2009| last=White| first=Cindy}}&lt;/ref&gt; which documents his participation in the movie as a non-speaking [[caveman]] in another special feature, ''The Dawn of Lying''.&lt;ref name="dawn"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://voices.yahoo.com/dvd-extras-better-than-movie-invention-lying-5327593.html| archive-url=https://archive.is/20130615223628/http://voices.yahoo.com/dvd-extras-better-than-movie-invention-lying-5327593.html| dead-url=yes| archive-date=15 June 2013| last=Gentry| first=Alexis| title=DVD Extras Better Than Movie on Invention of Lying Disc| date=22 January 2010| work=voices.yahoo.com| publisher=Yahoo}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=September 2015}} He was given a small role in the final episode of ''[[Extras (TV series)|Extras]]''.

In September 2010, Pilkington presented ''[[An Idiot Abroad]]'', a factual travel documentary series that aired on [[Sky1]] and that was produced by Gervais and Stephen Merchant, in which he visits the [[New 7 Wonders of the World]] while being directed by Gervais and Merchant into various activities along the way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sky1.sky.com/an-idiot-abroad |title=An Idiot Abroad Official Site |publisher=Sky1.sky.com |date=23 September 2011 |accessdate=3 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote a book to accompany the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the success of the first series, Pilkington starred in the second series subtitled ''The Bucket List'', which debuted on 23 September 2011 on [[Sky 1]]. The premise of the series involves Pilkington trying to experience "ultimate things to do before you die" except that the list of activities is not entirely of his choosing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sky1.sky.com/an-idiot-abroad/an-idiot-abroad-about |title=An Idiot Abroad 2: About the Show – Sky1 HD |publisher=Sky1.sky.com |date= |accessdate=3 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2011, he won the Best Presenter award for ''An Idiot Abroad'' at the Factual Entertainment Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://realscreen.com/2011/06/01/deadliest-catch-amazing-race-win-big-at-factual-entertainment-awards/ |title="Deadliest Catch"," Amazing Race" win big at Factual Entertainment Awards » Realscreen |first=Adam |last=Benzine|year=|accessdate=13 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third series of the show, ''An Idiot Abroad: The Short Way Round'' premiered in November 2012 and showed Pilkington and [[Warwick Davis]] travelling the [[Silk Road|Marco Polo route]].

Pilkington has performed [[voiceover]] work for such clients as One Stop Office Shop, [[Freeview (UK)|FreeView]], [[Vodafone]], [[HMV]], [[Sony PSP]], [[W H Smith]], [[Wickes]], and [[Unilever]]. 

He made his acting debut on 12 April 2012 in the [[Channel 4]] comedy-drama ''[[Derek (TV series)|Derek]]'', portraying [[Janitor|caretaker]] and [[bus driver]] Dougie. He left the show after the first episode of ''Derek'' series 2. 

In 2013, he starred in a five-part [[Sky 1]] documentary called ''[[The Moaning of Life]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2013/01/17/16971/karls_mid-life_crisis|title=Karl's mid-life crisis}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is set to write and star in a new Sky 1 scripted sitcom called ''[[Sick of It (TV series)|Sick of It]]'' in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/news/a838668/karl-pilkington-sky-1-sitcom-sick-of-it| title=Karl Pilkington Sky 1 Sitcom Sick of it| first=Bea| last=Mitchell| date=September 21, 2017| website=digitalspy.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charity work==
In 2014, Pilkington designed and signed his own card for UK charity [[Thomas Coram Foundation for Children]]. The campaign was launched by crafting company Stampin' Up! UK, and his card, along with those designed and signed by other celebrities, was auctioned off on [[eBay]] in May 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Benedict Cumberbatch, Tom Hiddleston, Jo Brand and more celebrities design and sign cards for UK's first children's charity|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/benedict-cumberbatch-tom-hiddleston-jo-3504331|publisher=Mirror Online|accessdate=7 May 2014|author=Rebecca Pocklington|date=6 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Pilkington has been in a long-term relationship with Suzanne Whiston, a former producer at the [[BBC]], since the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Karl Pilkington claims girlfriend won't be upset at being described as "plump" in new show The Moaning of Life |publisher=Mirror|author=James Robertson|date=19 September 2013|accessdate=5 January 2015|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/moaning-life-karl-pilkington-claims-2285405}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= 'Idiot Abroad' unimpressed by world's wonders |publisher=CNN|author=Danielle Paquette|date=28 January 2011|accessdate=5 January 2015|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/TRAVEL/01/28/idiot.abroad}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pilkington supports [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Features/2008/May/Famous-fan-Karl-Pilkington.aspx?pageNo=1|title=Famous fan: Karl Pilkington - Official Manchester United Website|author=|date=|website=www.manutd.com|accessdate=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
