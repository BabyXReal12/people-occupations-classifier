He is known for his humorous songs that make light of [[popular culture]] and often parody specific songs by contemporary musical acts, original songs that are style [[pastiche]]s of the work of other acts, and [[polka]] medleys of several popular songs, featuring his favored instrument, the [[accordion]].

Since his first-aired comedy song in 1976, he has sold more than 12 million albums ({{as of|2007|lc=y}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/09/AR2007080900305.html |last=Harrington |first=Richard |title=Weird Al's Imitation: A Funky Form of Flattery |work=Washington Post |accessdate=August 10, 2007 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kESmJdXg?url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/09/AR2007080900305.html |archivedate=October 2, 2009 |deadurl=no |date=August 10, 2007 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; recorded more than 150 parody and original songs,&lt;ref name="catchup"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ninemsn.video.msn.com/v/en-au/v.htm?f=39&amp;g=b738d4f6-1921-4e6f-9836-1ce2b2b0850c&amp;p=autvshows_authecatchup&amp;t=m2556&amp;mediaid=77139 |title=Weird Al Yankovic's latest send-ups on The Catch-up|accessdate=March 14, 2007|archivedate=September 22, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070922002829/http://ninemsn.video.msn.com/v/en-au/v.htm?f=39&amp;g=b738d4f6-1921-4e6f-9836-1ce2b2b0850c&amp;p=autvshows_authecatchup&amp;t=m2556&amp;mediaid=77139}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="catalog"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weirdal.com/catalog.htm |title=Weird Al Yankovic: Catalog |accessdate=October 28, 2006 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kESmp2r0?url=http://www.weirdal.com/catalog.htm |archivedate=October 2, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weirdal.com/bio.htm| title=Weird Al Yankovic: Biographies|accessdate=October 28, 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061110025903/http://weirdal.com/bio.htm| archivedate= November 10, 2006&lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has performed more than 1,000 live shows.&lt;ref name="livepage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weirdal.com/livepage.htm |title=Weird Al Yankovic: Live Performances|accessdate=November 10, 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061113132038/http://weirdal.com/livepage.htm| archivedate= November 13, 2006&lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; His works have earned him four [[Grammy Award]]s and a further eleven nominations, four [[RIAA certification|gold records]], and six [[RIAA certification|platinum records]] in the United States. Yankovic's first top ten ''[[Billboard charts|Billboard]]'' album (''[[Straight Outta Lynwood]]'') and single ("[[White &amp; Nerdy]]") were both released in 2006, nearly three decades into his career. His latest album, ''[[Mandatory Fun]]'' (2014), became his first number-one album during its debut week.

Yankovic's success comes in part from his effective use of music video to further parody popular culture, the song's original artist, and the original music videos themselves, scene-for-scene in some cases. He directed later videos himself and went on to direct for other artists including [[Ben Folds]], [[Hanson (band)|Hanson]], [[The Black Crowes]], and [[The Presidents of the United States of America (band)|The Presidents of the United States of America]]. With the decline of [[music television]] and the onset of [[social media]], Yankovic used [[YouTube]] and other video sites to publish his videos; this strategy proved integral helping to boost sales of his later albums including ''Mandatory Fun''. Yankovic has stated that he may forgo traditional albums in favor of timely releases of singles and EPs following on this success.

In addition to recording his albums, Yankovic wrote and starred in the film ''[[UHF (film)|UHF]]'' (1989) and ''[[The Weird Al Show]]'' (1997). He has also made guest appearances and performed voice acting roles on many television shows and video web content, in addition to starring in ''[[Al TV]]'' specials on MTV.&lt;ref name=allmusic&gt;{{cite news|last=Ankeny |first=Jason |title=Weird Al Yankovic Biography |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/weird-al-yankovic-mn0000817315/biography |publisher=[[AllMusic.com]] ([[Rovi]]) |accessdate=July 24, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6aGZzJGWM?url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/weird-al-yankovic-mn0000817315/biography |archivedate=July 24, 2015 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also written two children's books, ''When I Grow Up'' and ''My New Teacher and Me!''

Yankovic was born in [[Downey, California]] and raised in [[Lynwood, California]]. He is the only child of Mary Elizabeth (Vivalda) and Nick Yankovic.&lt;ref name="faq"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weirdal.com/archives/faq/ |title= Frequently Asked Questions| publisher= "Weird Al" Yankovic official website |accessdate=July 24, 2015| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150321162320/http://weirdal.com/archives/faq/|quote=He grew up in Lynwood, California (a suburb of Los Angeles), although the hospital he was actually born in was in the neighboring town of Downey ...

Mary, who was of [[Italians|Italian]] and English descent, had come to California from [[Kentucky]], and gave birth to Alfred ten years later.&lt;ref name="booklet"/&gt;

Al's first accordion lesson, which sparked his career in music, was on the day before his sixth birthday. A door-to-door salesman traveling through Lynwood offered the Yankovic parents a choice of [[accordion]] or [[guitar]] lessons at a local music school. Yankovic claims the reason his parents chose accordion over guitar was "they figured there should be at least one more accordion-playing Yankovic in the world", referring to [[Frankie Yankovic]],&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dmdb.org/al/booklet.html|title=Permanent Record: Al in the Box|accessdate=August 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; to whom he is not related.&lt;ref name=Conrad/&gt; Additionally, Yankovic said that "[his] parents chose the accordion because they were convinced it would revolutionize rock."&lt;ref name="Conrad"/&gt; He continued lessons at the school for three years before deciding to learn on his own.&lt;ref name="faq"/&gt;

In the 1970s, Yankovic was a big fan of [[Elton John]] and claims John's ''[[Goodbye Yellow Brick Road]]'' album "was partly how I learned to play rock 'n roll on the accordion."&lt;ref name="booklet"/&gt;  As for his influences in comedic and parody music, Yankovic lists artists including [[Tom Lehrer]], [[Stan Freberg]], [[Spike Jones]], [[Allan Sherman]], [[Shel Silverstein]] and [[Frank Zappa]] "and all the other wonderfully sick and twisted artists that he was exposed to through the ''[[Dr. Demento]] Radio Show''."&lt;ref name="faq"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.myspace.com/weirdal |title="Weird Al" Yankovic on MySpace|accessdate=April 2, 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061202004114/http://www.myspace.com/weirdal| archivedate= December 2, 2006&lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other sources of inspiration for his comedy come from [[Mad (magazine)|''Mad'' magazine]],&lt;ref name="booklet"/&gt; [[Monty Python]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast|url=http://podcasts.triplem.com.au/audio/20070307_spoon_best_weirdalredux.mp3|title="Weird Al" Yankovic interview by Spoonman on Triple M Australia|time=9:10|accessdate=April 2, 2007|archivedate=July 4, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704191934/http://podcasts.triplem.com.au/audio/20070307_spoon_best_weirdalredux.mp3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker]] parody movies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weirdal.com/aaarchive.htm#0494|title=Midnight Star "Ask Al" Q&amp;As for April 1994|accessdate=April 2, 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070329025047/http://www.weirdal.com/aaarchive.htm#090604| archivedate= March 29, 2007&lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yankovic began kindergarten a year earlier than most children, and he skipped [[second grade]]. "My classmates seemed to think I was some kind of [[wikt:rocket scientist|rocket scientist]] so I was labeled a nerd early on," he recalls.&lt;ref name="booklet"/&gt; As his unusual schooling left him two years younger than most of his classmates, Yankovic was not interested in sports or social events at school. He attended [[Lynwood High School]]. Yankovic was active in his school's extracurricular programs, including the [[National Forensic League]] sanctioned [[public speaking|speech]] events, a play based upon ''[[Rebel Without a Cause]]'', the yearbook (for which he wrote most of the captions), and the Volcano Worshippers club, "which did absolutely nothing. We started the club just to get an extra picture of ourselves in the yearbook."&lt;ref name="booklet"/&gt; Yankovic graduated in 1975&lt;ref name=thebook&gt;{{cite book |title=Weird Al: The Book |first=Nathan |last=Rabin |authorlink=Nathan Rabin |author2=Al Yankovic |date=2012 |publisher=[[Abrams Books]] |location=New York |isbn=1419704354 |page=11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was [[valedictorian]] of his senior class.&lt;ref name="booklet"/&gt;

Yankovic attended [[California Polytechnic State University]] in [[San Luis Obispo, California|San Luis Obispo]] where he earned a bachelor's degree in [[architecture]].&lt;ref name="Conrad"/&gt;

== Career ==

=== Dr. Demento and early fame ===
Yankovic received his first exposure via Southern California and syndicated comedy radio personality [[Dr. Demento]]'s radio show, saying "If there hadn't been a Dr. Demento, I'd probably have a real job now."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dr. Demento Marks 30 Years Of Funny Music|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/us/new-york/syracuse/syracuse-post-standard/2000/03-01/page-36|first=Jim|last=Bessman|agency=BPI Entertainment}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976, Dr. Demento spoke at Yankovic's school where the then-16-year-old Yankovic gave him a homemade [[Compact Cassette|tape]] of original and parody songs performed on the accordion in Yankovic's bedroom into a "cheesy little tape recorder".  The tape's first song, "Belvedere Cruisin'" - about his family's [[Plymouth Belvedere##1962–1964|Plymouth Belvedere]] - was played on Demento's comedy radio show, launching Yankovic's career. Demento said, "'Belvedere Cruising' might not have been the very best song I ever heard, but it had some clever lines [...] I put the tape on the air immediately."&lt;ref name="booklet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="unlabeled tape"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://weirdal.com/rare89.htm |title="Weird Al" Yankovic: Rare Items: UNLABELED TAPE |accessdate=August 24, 2006 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5fkODSx8I?url=http://weirdal.com/rare89.htm |archivedate=April 3, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Yankovic also played at local coffeehouses, accompanied by fellow dorm resident Joel Miller on bongos.&lt;ref name="wapost feb2017"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/style/2017/02/16/how-weird-al-eclipsed-almost-every-star-he-ever-parodied/ | title = Was ‘Weird Al’ the real star all along? | first = Geoff | last = Edgars | date = February 16, 2017 | accessdate = November 16, 2017 | work = [[The Washington Post]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Yankovic said:
{{Quote|It was sort of like amateur music night, and a lot of people were like wannabe [[Dan Fogelberg]]s. They'd get up on stage with their acoustic guitar and do these lovely ballads. And I would get up with my accordion and play the [[Also sprach Zarathustra (Strauss)|theme from]] [[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|''2001'']]. And people were kind of shocked that I would be disrupting their mellow Thursday night folk fest.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://blog.nj.com/ledgerentertainment/2007/08/michael_blackwellif_you_asked.html The clown prince of song parodies].", ''[[The Star-Ledger]]'', August 10, 2007. p14.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

During Yankovic's sophomore year as an architecture student at Cal Poly, he became a disc jockey at [[KCPR]] the university's radio station. Yankovic said he had originally been nicknamed "Weird Al" by fellow students and "took it on professionally" as his persona for the station.&lt;ref name="booklet"/&gt; In 1978, he released his first recording (as Alfred Yankovic), "Take Me Down", on the LP, ''Slo Grown'', as a benefit for the Economic Opportunity Commission of [[San Luis Obispo County, California|San Luis Obispo County]]. The song mocked famous nearby landmarks such as [[Bubblegum Alley]] and the fountain toilets at the [[Madonna Inn]].

In mid-1979, shortly before his senior year, "[[My Sharona]]" by [[The Knack]] was on the charts and Yankovic took his accordion into the restroom across the hall from the radio station to take advantage of the [[echo chamber]] acoustics and recorded a parody titled "[[My Bologna]]".&lt;ref name= takingoff/&gt; He sent it to Dr. Demento, who played it to good response from listeners.  Yankovic met The Knack after a show at his college and introduced himself as the author of "My Bologna". The Knack's lead singer, [[Doug Fieger]], said he liked the song and suggested that [[Capitol Records]] vice president [[Rupert Perry]] release it as a single.&lt;ref name="booklet"/&gt; "My Bologna" was released as a single with "School Cafeteria" as its B-side, and the label gave Yankovic a six-month recording contract.  Yankovic, who was "only getting average grades" in his architecture degree, began to realize that he might make a career of comedic music.&lt;ref name="booklet"/&gt;

On September 14, 1980, Yankovic was a guest on the ''Dr. Demento Show'', where he was to record a new parody live. The song was called "[[Another One Rides the Bus]]", a parody of [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s hit, "[[Another One Bites the Dust]]". While practicing the song outside the sound booth, he met [[Jon Schwartz (drummer)|Jon "Bermuda" Schwartz]], who told him he was a drummer and agreed to bang on Yankovic's accordion case to help Yankovic keep a steady beat during the song. They rehearsed the song just a few times before the show began.&lt;ref name="booklet"/&gt; "Another One Rides the Bus" became so popular that Yankovic's first television appearance was a performance of the song on ''[[Tomorrow (TV series)|The Tomorrow Show]]'' (April 21, 1981) with [[Tom Snyder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=TV Listings, Tuesday, April 21 |work=The Baltimore Sun |date=April 19, 1981 |page=TV24 |url= http://search.proquest.com/docview/535950110/64D022730CE94ECBPQ/1?accountid=46320}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the show, Yankovic played his accordion, and again, Schwartz banged on the accordion case and provided comical sound effects. Yankovic's record label, [[TK Records]], went bankrupt about two weeks after the single was released, so Yankovic received no royalties from its initial release.&lt;ref name=takingoff&gt;{{cite news |last=Harrington |first=Richard |title='Weird Al' Taking Off |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=May 19, 1983 |page=C8 |url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/147567013/64D022730CE94ECBPQ/10?accountid=46320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Band and fame ===
1981 brought Yankovic on tour for the first time as part of Dr. Demento's stage show. His stage act in a [[Phoenix, Arizona]], nightclub caught the eye of manager Jay Levey, who was "blown away".&lt;ref name="booklet"/&gt; Levey asked Yankovic if he had considered creating a full band and doing his music as a career. Yankovic admitted that he had, so Levey held auditions. [[Steve Jay]] became Yankovic's bass player, and Jay's friend [[Jim West (guitarist)|Jim West]] played guitar. Schwartz continued on drums. Yankovic's first show with his new band was on March 31, 1982.&lt;ref name="livepage"/&gt;  Several days later, Yankovic and his band were the opening act for [[Missing Persons (band)|Missing Persons]].

Yankovic recorded "[[I Love Rocky Road]]", (a parody of "[[I Love Rock 'n' Roll]]" originally recorded by [[Arrows (British band)|The Arrows]]) which was produced by [[Rick Derringer]], in 1982.  The song was a hit on Top 40 radio, leading to Yankovic's signing with [[Scotti Brothers Records]]. In 1983, Yankovic's first [["Weird Al" Yankovic (album)|self-titled album]] was released on Scotti Bros. The song "[[Ricky (song)|Ricky]]" was released as a single and the music video received exposure on the still-young [[MTV]]. "Ricky" broke the top 100 videos on MTV at the time, which Yankovic took as a sign that his career was in music, quitting his job as a mailroom clerk at the local offices of [[Westwood One (1976-2011)|Westwood One]] to pursue the music career.&lt;ref name="wapost feb2017"/&gt;

Yankovic released his second album ''[["Weird Al" Yankovic in 3-D]]'' in 1984. The first single "[[Eat It]]", a parody of the [[Michael Jackson]] song "[[Beat It]]", became popular, thanks in part to the music video, a shot-for-shot parody of Jackson's "Beat It" music video, and what Yankovic described as his "uncanny resemblance" to Jackson. Peaking at No.  12 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] on April 14, 1984,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Eat It – Weird Al Yankovic |url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=weird al yankovic|chart=all}} |work=Billboard}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Eat It" remained Yankovic's highest-charting single until "[[White &amp; Nerdy]]" placed at No.  9 in October 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=White &amp; Nerdy |url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=weird al yankovic|chart=all}} |work=Billboard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, Yankovic co-wrote and starred in a [[mockumentary]] of his own life titled ''[[The Compleat Al]]'' (the title being a parody of the 1982 documentary ''[[The Compleat Beatles]]''), which intertwined the facts of his life up to that point with fiction. The movie also featured some clips from Yankovic's trip to Japan and some clips from the ''[[Al TV]]'' specials. ''The Compleat Al'' was co-directed by Jay Levey, who would direct ''[[UHF (film)|UHF]]'' four years later. Also released around the same time as ''The Compleat Al'' was ''The Authorized Al'', a biographical book based on the film.  The book, resembling a scrapbook, included real and fictional humorous photographs and documents.

Yankovic and his band toured as the opening act for [[The Monkees]] in mid-1987 for their second reunion tour of North America. Yankovic claims to have enjoyed touring with The Monkees, even though "the promoter gypped us out of a bunch of money."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title='Ask Al' Q&amp;As for November, 1998 |url=http://www.weirdal.com/aaarchive.htm#1198 |accessdate=June 5, 2007 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070609200738/http://www.weirdal.com/aaarchive.htm#top |archivedate=June 9, 2007&lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988 Yankovic was the narrator on the [[Wendy Carlos]] recording of [[Sergei Prokofiev]]'s ''[[Peter and the Wolf]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Johnson, [http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1989-07-25/features/8902200286_1_ex-police-sting-tune/2 "Weirdly Normal: Pop-tune Buster Al Yankovic Saves Worst Wackiness For The Screen"], ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', July 25, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; The album also included a sequel to [[Camille Saint-Saëns]]'s composition ''[[The Carnival of the Animals]]'' titled "The Carnival of the Animals Part II", with Yankovic providing humorous poems for each of the featured creatures in the style of [[Ogden Nash]], who had written humorous poems for the original.

[[Rubén Valtierra]] joined the band on keyboards in 1991, allowing Yankovic to concentrate more on singing and increasing his use of the stage space during concerts.

Up through 1992, six of Yankovic's albums were produced by [[Rick Derringer]], for which he won two [[Grammy Awards]]. However, due to a combination of Yankovic's more complex musical scores (involving horns and other instruments), and drug-related issues that Derringer had at that time, Yankovic took over production of his albums in 1992.&lt;ref name="wapost feb2017"/&gt;

A factual biographical booklet of Yankovic's life, written by [[Dr. Demento]], was released with the 1994 box set compilation ''[[Permanent Record: Al in the Box]]''.&lt;ref name="booklet"/&gt;  The Dr. Demento Society, which issues yearly Christmas re-releases of material from Dr. Demento's Basement Tapes, often includes unreleased tracks from Yankovic's vaults, such as "Pacman", "It's Still Billy Joel To Me" or the live version of "School Cafeteria".

=== New look and career to present ===
[[File:Weirdalclassic.jpg|thumb|Yankovic's "classic" look before eye surgery: with glasses, mustache and short, curly hair; used from 1979 to 1998]]

On January 24, 1998, Yankovic had [[LASIK]] eye surgery to correct his extreme [[myopia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=LASIK story and pictures |url=http://weirdal.com/thelook1.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025050146/http://www.weirdal.com/thelook1.htm |archivedate=October 25, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; When ''[[Running with Scissors ("Weird Al" Yankovic album)|Running with Scissors]]'' debuted in 1999, he unveiled a radically changed look. In addition to shedding his glasses, he had shaved off his [[mustache]] and grown out his hair. He had previously shaved his moustache in 1983 for the video of "[[Ricky (song)|Ricky]]" to resemble [[Desi Arnaz]], and 1996 for the "[[Amish Paradise]]" video. Yankovic reasoned, "If [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s allowed to reinvent herself every 15&amp;nbsp;minutes, I figure I should be good for a change at least once every 20 years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Archive.org for www.weirdal.com/bio.htm for February 8, 2001 |url=http://www.weirdal.com/bio.htm |accessdate=October 29, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010208173222/http://www.weirdal.com/bio.htm |archivedate=February 8, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; He parodied the reaction to this "new look" in a commercial for his nonexistent ''[[MTV Unplugged]]'' special. The commercial featured Yankovic in the short-haired wig from the music video for [[Hanson (band)|Hanson's]] "River", claiming his new look was an attempt to "get back to the core of what I'm all about", that being "the music".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title='Weird Al' Yankovic MTV Unplugged Promo |url=http://www.al-oholicsanonymous.com/videos/EatItUnpluggedPromo.wmv |accessdate=October 28, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060929075952/http://www.al-oholicsanonymous.com/videos/EatItUnpluggedPromo.wmv |archivedate=September 29, 2006&lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yankovic has also started to explore [[digital distribution]] of his songs.  On October 7, 2008, Yankovic released to the [[iTunes Store]] "[[Whatever You Like ("Weird Al" Yankovic song)|Whatever You Like]]", a parody of the [[T.I.]] [[Whatever You Like (T.I. song)|song of the same title]], which Yankovic said he had come up with two weeks before. Yankovic said that the benefit of digital distribution is that "I don't have to wait around while my songs get old and dated—I can get them out on the Internet almost immediately."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Vreval |first=Jeff |title=Weird Al Goes Digital With T.I.

However, upon first submitting it to Lady Gaga's manager for approval (which Yankovic does as a courtesy), he was not given permission to release it commercially. As he had previously done under similar circumstances (with his parody of James Blunt's "[[You're Beautiful]]", which was titled "[[You're Pitiful]]"), Yankovic then released the song for free on the internet. Soon afterwards, Gaga's manager admitted that he had denied the parody of his own accord without forwarding the song to his client, and upon seeing it online, Lady Gaga granted permission for the parody. Yankovic has stated that all of his proceeds from the parody and its music video will be donated to the Human Rights Campaign, to support the human rights themes of the original song.&lt;ref name="Gaga Parody Permission"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alyankovic.wordpress.com/the-gaga-saga/ |title=The Gaga Saga |accessdate=April 20, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5y61XzOga?url=http://alyankovic.wordpress.com/the-gaga-saga/ |archivedate=April 20, 2011 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gaga Parody Update"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://alyankovic.wordpress.com/2011/04/20/gaga-update/ |title=Gaga Update |accessdate=April 20, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110426031039/http://alyankovic.wordpress.com/2011/04/20/gaga-update/| archivedate= April 26, 2011&lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yankovic was also a judge for the 10th annual Independent Music Awards to support independent artists' careers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independentmusicawards.com/ima_new/pastjudges.asp |title=Past Judges |publisher=Independent Music Awards |accessdate=October 26, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110724134001/http://www.independentmusicawards.com/ima_new/pastjudges.asp| archivedate= July 24, 2011&lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parodies===
Yankovic is well known for creating parodies of contemporary radio hits, typically which make up about half of his studio releases. Unlike other parody artists such as [[Allan Sherman]], Yankovic and his band strive to keep the backing music in his parodies the same as the original, transcribing the original song by ear and re-recording the song for the parody.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/weird-al-endures | title = Weird Al Endures | date = July 16, 2014 | accessdate = August 8, 2014 | work = [[The New Yorker|New Yorker]] | first = Ian | last = Crouch }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, in requesting the original band to allow for his parody, the band will offer to help out with the recreation: [[Dire Straits]] members [[Mark Knopfler]] and [[Guy Fletcher]] perform on "[[Money for Nothing/Beverly Hillbillies*]]", Yankovic's parody of [[Dire Straits]]' "[[Money for Nothing (song)|Money for Nothing]]", while [[Imagine Dragons]] provided Yankovic with advice on how to recreate some of the electronic sounds they used for "Radioactive" in Yankovic's parody "Inactive".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6157636/weird-al-yankovic-interview-pharrell-mandatory-fun |title='Weird Al' Yankovic On Getting Pharrell's Permission: 'He Could Not Have Been Nicer' |first=Gary |last= Graff |date=July 15, 2014 |accessdate=July 15, 2014 |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yankovic's career in novelty and comedy music has outlasted many of his "mainstream" parody targets, such as [[Toni Basil]], [[MC Hammer]], and [[Men Without Hats]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spokane7.com/music/stories/?ID=401|title=Weird Al's shtick still draws a crowd|accessdate=October 16, 2006|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927182156/http://www.spokane7.com/music/stories/?ID=401|archivedate=September 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wickedlocal.com/northofboston/x1575047109|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120923200022/http://www.wickedlocal.com/northofboston/x1575047109|archivedate=September 23, 2012|title=Revenge of the nerd: 'Weird Al' gets all white and nerdy for summer tour|accessdate=August 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yankovic's continued success (including the top 10 single "[[White &amp; Nerdy]]" and album ''[[Straight Outta Lynwood]]'' in 2006) has enabled him to escape the one-hit wonder stigma often associated with novelty music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tweak.com/phonetag/weirdal|title=Tweak: Phone Tag – Weird Al Yankovic|accessdate=October 16, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060509010828/http://www.tweak.com/phonetag/weirdal|archivedate=May 9, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although many of Yankovic's songs are parodies of contemporary radio hits, it is rare that the song's primary topic lampoons the original artist as a person, or the song itself. Most Yankovic songs consist of the original song's music, with a separate, unrelated set of amusing lyrics. Yankovic's humor normally lies more in creating unexpected incongruity between an artist's image and the topic of the song, contrasting the style of the song with its content (such as the songs "[[Amish Paradise]]", "[[White &amp; Nerdy]]", and "[[You're Pitiful]]"), or in pointing out trends or works which have become pop culture clichés (such as "[[eBay (song)|eBay]]" and "[[Don't Download This Song]]"). Yankovic's parodies are often satirical of [[popular culture]], including television (''see [[The TV Album]]''), movies ("[[The Saga Begins]]"), and food (''see [[The Food Album]]'').  Yankovic claims he has no intention of writing "serious" music. In his reasoning, "There's enough people that do unfunny music. I'll leave the serious stuff to [[Paris Hilton]] and [[Kevin Federline]]."&lt;ref name="hub"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hub.lsj.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070702/NOISE02/707040313/1104/HUB |title='Weird Al' Yankovic – Parodist promises a high-energy show – with costume changes |accessdate=July 8, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930020306/http://hub.lsj.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20070702%2FNOISE02%2F707040313%2F1104%2FHUB |archivedate=September 30, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yankovic considered that his first true satirical song was "[[Smells Like Nirvana]]", which references unintelligible lyrics in [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s "[[Smells Like Teen Spirit]]".&lt;ref name="avclub setlist"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/weird-al-yankovic,58244 |title="Weird Al" Yankovic |first=Nathan |last=Rabin |date=June 29, 2011 |accessdate=June 29, 2011 |publisher=[[The A.V. Club]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5zodtUwdj?url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/weird-al-yankovic,58244/ |archivedate=June 30, 2011 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other satirical songs include "[[Achy Breaky Song]]", which refers to the song "[[Achy Breaky Heart]]", "(This Song's Just) Six Words Long", which refers to the repetitious lyrics in "[[Got My Mind Set on You]]", and "[[Perform This Way]]", set to [[Lady Gaga]]'s "[[Born This Way (song)|Born This Way]]" that drew inspiration from Lady Gaga's outlandish but confident attitude.

Yankovic is the sole writer for all his songs and, for "legal and personal reasons", does not accept parody submissions or ideas from fans.&lt;ref name="faq"/&gt; There exists, however, one exception to this rule: [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] was reportedly talking with a friend and happened to wonder aloud when Yankovic was going to turn her "[[Like a Virgin (song)|Like a Virgin]]" into "[[Like a Surgeon ("Weird Al" Yankovic song)|Like a Surgeon]]". Madonna's friend was a mutual friend of Yankovic's manager, Jay Levey, and eventually Yankovic himself heard the story from Levey.&lt;ref name="booklet"/&gt;

===Polka medleys===
Most of Yankovic's studio albums include a [[polka]] medley of about a dozen contemporary songs at the time of the album, with the choruses or memorable lines of various songs juxtaposed for humorous effect. In Yankovic's early career, before recording his first album, he had performed such polka medleys in live shows in California, though then using songs from lesser-known bands like [[Bad Brains]] and the [[Plasmatics]]. He had been inspired to do so from Spike Jones, who had transitioned classical music into polka.&lt;ref name="avbook book exerpt"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.avclub.com/exclusive-book-excerpt-weird-al-isnt-just-a-parody-mas-1819695905 | title = Exclusive book excerpt: Weird Al isn't just a parody master | first = Ray | last = Padgett | date = October 25, 2017 | accessdate = November 15, 2017 | work = [[The A.V. Club]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Yankovic said that converting these songs to polka was "...the way God intended".&lt;ref name="livedaily 2007"/&gt; Yankovic did not include a medley on his first album, but considered this for his second, ''In 3-D'', recognizing that it would only work if he used well-known songs. The resulting "Polkas on 45", which featured songs from [[Devo]], [[Deep Purple]], [[Berlin (band)|Berlin]], and [[The Beatles]], was popular, and the polka medley became a staple of all but one of Yankovic's future albums.&lt;ref name="avbook book exerpt"/&gt; Yankovic said that "fans would be rioting in the streets, I think, if I didn't do a polka medley."&lt;ref name="livedaily 2007"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livedaily.com/news/Weird_Al_talks_new_album_2007_tour-10776.html?t=1|title='Weird Al' talks new album, 2007 tour|accessdate=October 26, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061021191206/http://www.livedaily.com/news/Weird_Al_talks_new_album_2007_tour-10776.html?t=1|archivedate=October 21, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; More current polka medleys features songs that Yankovic had wanted to parody but proved difficult, such as [[Daft Punk]]'s "[[Get Lucky (Daft Punk song)|Get Lucky]]", which lacked sufficient lyrics to parody.&lt;ref name="avbook book exerpt"/&gt; The polkas are recorded in studio, including the sound effects which are performed live during recording, which Yankovic considered one of his favorite parts of recording.&lt;ref name="avbook book exerpt"/&gt;

===Original songs===
Yankovic has recorded numerous original humorous songs, such as "[[You Don't Love Me Anymore ("Weird Al" Yankovic song)|You Don't Love Me Anymore]]" and "[[One More Minute]]".&lt;ref name="faq"/&gt; Many of these songs are style [[pastiches]] of specific bands with allusions to specific songs. For example, "First World Problems" from ''Mandatory Fun'' is a style take on the [[Pixies (band)|Pixies]], with the opening stanza reminiscent of the Pixies' "[[Debaser]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.avclub.com/review/weird-al-yankovic-smartly-skewers-embraces-pop-cul-206851 | title = "Weird Al" Yankovic smartly skewers, embraces pop culture | first = Annie | last = Zaleski | date = July 15, 2014 | accessdate = August 8, 2014 | publisher = [[The A.V. Club]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other style parodies includes those of [[Rage Against the Machine]] with "[[I'll Sue Ya]]" (which features many aspects of the hit song "[[Killing in the Name]]"), [[Devo]] with "[[Dare to Be Stupid (song)|Dare to Be Stupid]]", [[Talking Heads]] with "Dog Eat Dog", [[Frank Zappa]] with "Genius in France", [[Nine Inch Nails]] with "Germs", and [[Queen (band)|Queen]] with "Ringtone".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weirdal.com/aaarchive.htm#0100|title="Ask Al" Q&amp;As for January 2000|accessdate=October 30, 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061106023621/http://www.weirdal.com/aaarchive.htm| archivedate= November 6, 2006&lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some songs are pastiches of an overall [[music genre|genre]] of music, rather than a specific band (for example, [[country music]] with "Good Enough For Now", [[charity record]]s with "[[Don't Download This Song]]") and college fight songs with "Sports Song". Yankovic stated that he does not have any unreleased original songs, instead coming up and committing to the song ideas he arrives at for his albums and other releases.&lt;ref name="spin 2014"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.spin.com/2014/12/weird-al-yankovic-interview-best-of-2014-mandatory-fun/ | title = SPIN 2014 Exit Interviews: 'Weird Al' Yankovic | first = Dan | last = Weiss | date = December 19, 2014 | accessdate = December 19, 2014  | work = [[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yankovic has contributed original songs to several films ("This Is the Life" from ''[[Johnny Dangerously]]''; "[[Polkamon]]" from the movie ''[[Pokémon: The Movie 2000]]'', and a parody of the [[James Bond]] title sequence in ''[[Spy Hard]]''), in addition to his own film, ''[[UHF (film)|UHF]]''. Other songs of his have appeared in films or television series as well, such as "[[Dare to Be Stupid (song)|Dare to Be Stupid]]" in ''[[The Transformers: The Movie]]''.

===Recurring themes===
One of Yankovic's recurring jokes involves the number [[27 (number)|27]]. It is mentioned in the lyrics of several songs, and seen on the covers for ''[[Running with Scissors ("Weird Al" Yankovic album)|Running With Scissors]]'', ''[[Poodle Hat]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weirdal.com/images/phathires.jpg|title='&amp;#39;Poodle Hat'&amp;#39; album cover|accessdate=October 26, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110612183015/http://www.weirdal.com/images/phathires.jpg| archivedate= June 12, 2011&lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Straight Outta Lynwood]]''. He had originally just pulled the number 27 as a random figure to use in filling out lyrics, but as his fans started to notice the reuse of the number after the first few times, he began to purposely drop references to 27 within his lyrics, videos, and album covers. He explains that "It's just a number I started using that people started attaching a lot of importance to."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/weird-al-yankovic,14163|title=Interview: "Weird Al" Yankovic|date=October 17, 2007|accessdate=July 2, 2011|first=David|last=Wolinsky|publisher=[[The A.V. Club]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other recurring jokes revolve around the names Bob (the ''[[Al TV]]'' interviews often mention the name,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGiUu2ciYY|title=Weird Al Interviews Avril Lavigne|accessdate=October 29, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131210155357/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGiUu2ciYY |archivedate=December 10, 2013 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Bowe (actor)|David Bowe]]'s character in ''[[UHF (film)|UHF]]'' is named Bob, and a song called "Bob", done in the style of [[Bob Dylan]], is featured on ''[[Poodle Hat]]''), Frank (e.g. "Frank's 2000" TV"), and the surname "Finkelstein" (e.g. the music video for "[[I Lost on Jeopardy]]", or [[Fran Drescher]]'s character, Pamela Finkelstein, in ''UHF''). Also, a [[hamster]] called [[Harvey the Wonder Hamster]] is a recurring character in ''[[The Weird Al Show]]'' and the ''Al TV'' specials, as well as the subject of an original song on ''[[Alapalooza]]''. Other recurring jokes include Yankovic borrowing, or being owed, $5. In a number of ''Al TV'' interviews, he often asks if he can borrow $5, being turned down every time. This motif also occurs in "[[Poodle Hat|Why Does This Always Happen to Me?]]", in which his deceased friend owes him $5. Another recurring joke is his attraction to female nostrils or nostrils in general. This also appears in numerous ''Al TV'' interviews as well as in several of his songs ("[[Albuquerque (song)|Albuquerque]]" and "[[Poodle Hat|Wanna B Ur Lovr]]" to name a few.) Yankovic also asks his celebrity guests if they could "shave his back for a nickel." This also appears in the song "[[Albuquerque (song)|Albuquerque]]". Yankovic has also put two [[backmasking]] messages into his songs. The first, in "Nature Trail to Hell", said "Satan Eats [[Cheez Whiz]]"; the second, in "I Remember Larry", said "Wow, you must have an awful lot of free time on your hands."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-oholicsanonymous.com/faq/#secret|title=Al-oholics Anonymous' Frequently Asked Questions|accessdate=August 24, 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060829151229/http://www.al-oholicsanonymous.com/faq/| archivedate= August 29, 2006&lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Music videos ===
While Yankovic's musical parodies generally do not include references to the songs or the artists of the original songs, Yankovic's music videos will sometimes parody the original song's music video in whole or in part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.theverge.com/2014/7/23/5926693/the-8-most-best-weird-al-parodies-video | title = The 8 best Weird Al parody videos | publisher = [[The Verge]] | date = July 23, 2014 | accessdate = July 25, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most notably, the video for "[[Smells Like Nirvana]]" uses an extremely similar set to [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s "[[Smells Like Teen Spirit]]", including using several of the same actors. This video contended with "Smells like Teen Spirit" at the 1992 [[MTV Video Music Awards]] for Best Male Video. Other videos that draw directly from those of the original song include "[[Eat It]]", "[[Fat (song)|Fat]]", "[[Money for Nothing/Beverly Hillbillies*]]", "[[Bedrock Anthem]]", "[[Headline News (song)|Headline News]]", "[[It's All About the Pentiums]]", "Amish Paradise", "Like a Surgeon", and "[[White &amp; Nerdy]]". The video for "[[Dare to Be Stupid]]" is, as stated by Yankovic, a style parody in general of [[Devo]] videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weirdal.com/aaarchive.htm#0100|title=Ask Al" Q&amp;As for January, 2000|accessdate=August 5, 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070806052956/http://weirdal.com/aaarchive.htm| archivedate= August 6, 2007&lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several videos have included appearances by notable celebrities in addition to Yankovic and his band. [[Dr. Demento]] appeared in several of Yankovic's earlier videos, such as "[[I Love Rocky Road]]" and "[[Ricky (song)|Ricky]]". Actor [[Dick Van Patten]] is featured in both "Smells Like Nirvana" and "[[Bedrock Anthem]]"; [[Drew Carey]], [[Emo Philips]] and [[Phil LaMarr]] appeared in "It's All About the Pentiums"; [[Keegan-Michael Key]], [[Jordan Peele]], [[Donny Osmond]], [[Judy Tenuta]] and [[Seth Green]] appeared in "White &amp; Nerdy"; and [[Ruth Buzzi]] and [[Pat Boone]] appeared in "Gump". The video for "[[I Lost on Jeopardy]]" includes an appearance by [[Greg Kihn]], the artist whose song, "Jeopardy", was being parodied, along with [[Don Pardo]] and [[Art Fleming]], Jeopardy's original announcer and host, as themselves. [[Florence Henderson]] plays an Amish seductress in "Amish Paradise".

While most videos that Yankovic creates are aired on music channels such as MTV and [[VH1]], Yankovic worked with animation artists to create music videos for release with extended content albums. The [[DualDisc]] version of ''Straight Outta Lynwood'' features six videos set to songs from the release, including videos created by [[Bill Plympton]] and [[John Kricfalusi]]; one video, "Weasel Stomping Day" was created by the producers of the show ''[[Robot Chicken]]'', and aired as a segment of that program. For the 2010 ''Alpocalypse'', Yankovic produced videos for every song; four of those were previously released for each of the songs on the EP ''[[Internet Leaks]]'', with the videos for the remaining songs released via social media sites and included in the deluxe edition of ''Alpocalypse''. These live-action and animated videos were produced by both previous collaborators such as Plympton for "TMZ",&lt;ref name="coedmag plympton"/&gt; video content providers like [[Jib-Jab]] and [[SuperNews!]], and other directors and animators.

To help promote his 2014 album ''Mandatory Fun'' in social media circles, Yankovic produced eight music videos for the album releasing them over eight consecutive days with release of the album, believing it "would make an impact because people would be talking about the album all week long".&lt;ref name="foxnews 8days"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2014/07/18/weird-al-yankovic-adapint-to-digital-age/ | title = Weird Al Yankovic adapting to digital age | first = Ashley | last = Dvohrik | date = July 18, 2014 | accessdate = July 19, 2014 | publisher = [[Fox News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://time.com/2949882/weird-al-yankovic-not-that-weird/ | title = The Al Yankovic Paradox: He Doesn't Seem That Weird Anymore | first = Lily | last = Rothman | date = July 2, 2014 | accessdate = July 2, 2014 | work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; RCA Records opted not to fund production of any of these videos, and Yankovic turned to various social media portals including [[Funny or Die]] and [[CollegeHumor]] which he had worked with in the past; these sites helped to cover the production cost of the videos with Yankovic foregoing any ad video revenue. He chose to distribute the videos to different portals to avoid burdening any single one with all of the costs and work needed to produce them. This approach proved to be successful, as the total collection of videos had acquired more than 20 million views in the first week.&lt;ref name="adage"/&gt; This release strategy was considered by ''[[The Atlantic]]'' as a "web-enabled precision video delivery operation, and evidence of some serious digital distributional forethought" as it allows the videos to be seen by different sets of audiences for each site.&lt;ref name="atlantic"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/07/the-surprisingly-savvy-weird-al-internet-machine/374649/ | title = The Surprisingly Savvy Weird Al Internet Machine | first = Robinson | last = Meyer | date = July 19, 2014 | accessdate = July 20, 2014 | work = [[The Atlantic]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The approach was considered to be essential to promoting ''Mandatory Fun'' to reach the No. 1 position on the ''Billboard'' charts on its debut week.&lt;ref name="billboardnews"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6176745/weird-al-yankovic-billboard-200-mandatory-fun-number-one | title = 'Weird Al' Yankovic Gets First No. 1 Album On ''Billboard'' 200 with 'Mandatory Fun' | first = Keith | last = Caulfield | date = July 23, 2014 | accessdate = July 23, 2014 |work = [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Businessweek]]'' attributed the sales success of ''Mandatory Fun'' to the viral music video campaign.&lt;ref name="businessweek"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-07-21/weird-al-yankovics-mandatory-fun-owns-the-internet | title = The Internet Should Have Killed Weird Al.

=== Reactions from original artists ===
Under the "[[fair use]]" provision of U.S. [[copyright]] law, affirmed by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] in the 1994 case ''[[Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.]]'', artists such as Yankovic do not need permission to record a [[parody]].&lt;ref name="rs chicken pot pie"&gt;{{cite web| url = https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/flashback-weird-als-rejected-wings-parody-chicken-pot-pie-20160526 | title = Flashback: Weird Al's Rejected Wings Parody, 'Chicken Pot Pie' | first = Andy | last = Greene | date = May 26, 2016 |accessdate = October 13, 2016 | work = [[Rolling Stone]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as a personal rule and as a means of maintaining good relationships, Yankovic has always sought permission from the original artist before commercially releasing a parody.&lt;ref name="rs chicken pot pie"/&gt;&lt;ref name="avbook book exerpt"/&gt; Yankovic stated of these efforts: "I don't want to hurt anybody's feelings. I don't want to be embroiled in any nastiness. That's not how I live my life. I like everybody to be in on the joke and be happy for my success. I take pains not to burn bridges."&lt;ref name="wapost feb2017"/&gt; The communications are typically handled by his manager Jay Levey, but at times Yankovic has asked the artist directly, such as flying to [[Denver, Colorado]], to attend an [[Iggy Azalea]] concert and speak to her personally about parodying her song "[[Fancy (Iggy Azalea song)|Fancy]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/digital-and-mobile/6188148/why-weird-al-yankovic-means-big-business | title = Why 'Weird Al' Yankovic Means Big Business | first = Gary | last =Graff | date = July 25, 2014 | accessdate=  July 26, 2014 | work = [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; He claims that only about two to three percent of the artists he approaches for permission deny his requests.&lt;ref name="wired gaga"/&gt;

Separately, Yankovic needs to negotiate for [[royalty payment|royalties]] to the original artists for including their songs within a polka medley, which is considered a [[cover version|cover]] in copyright law. This created difficulties in recording his first medley "Polkas on 45" since it involved thirteen different royalty schemes, but since then he has established a relationship with most large music publishers to easily secure the license to use their songs.&lt;ref name="avbook book exerpt"/&gt;

Many of those parodied by Yankovic have considered this as a rite of passage to show their band has made it in the music industry.&lt;ref name="wired gaga"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wapost feb2017"/&gt;

[[Michael Jackson]] was a big fan of Yankovic, and Yankovic claimed Jackson "had always been very supportive" of his work.&lt;ref name="wired gaga"/&gt; Jackson twice allowed him to parody his songs ("[[Beat It]]" and "[[Bad (Michael Jackson song)|Bad]]" became "[[Eat It]]" and "[[Fat (song)|Fat]]", respectively). When Jackson granted Yankovic permission to do "Fat", Jackson allowed him to use the same set built for his own "[[Badder]]" video from the ''[[Moonwalker]]'' film.&lt;ref name="people aug2016"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://people.com/celebrity/weird-al-yankovic-says-prince-wasnt-a-fan-of-his-parodies/ | title = Weird Al Yankovic Reveals the One Musician Who Always Said No – Prince | first = Gillian | last = Telling | date = August 2, 2016 | accessdate = October 13, 2016 | work = [[People (magazine)|People]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yankovic said that Jackson's support helped to gain approval from other artists he wanted to parody.&lt;ref name="people aug2016"/&gt; Though Jackson allowed "Eat It" and "Fat", he requested that Yankovic not record a parody of "[[Black or White]]", titled "Snack All Night", because he felt the message was too important.

[[Dave Grohl]] of Nirvana said that the band felt they had "made it" after Yankovic recorded "Smells Like Nirvana", a parody of the [[grunge]] band's smash hit, "[[Smells Like Teen Spirit]]".&lt;ref name="faq"/&gt; On his ''Behind the Music'' special, Yankovic stated that when he called Nirvana frontman [[Kurt Cobain]] to ask if he could parody the song, Cobain gave him permission, then paused and asked, "Um...  it's not gonna be about food, is it?" Yankovic responded with, "No, it'll be about how no one can understand your lyrics." According to members of Nirvana interviewed for ''Behind the Music'', when they saw the video of the song, they laughed hysterically. Additionally, Cobain described Yankovic as "a musical genius".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/gig-previews--reviews/weird-al-yankovic/2007/03/19/1174152930142.html|title=Weird Al Yankovic – Gig previews &amp; reviews|accessdate=April 16, 2007|location=Melbourne, Australia|work=The Age|date=March 19, 2007|first=Guy|last=Blackman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mark Knopfler]] approved Yankovic's parody of the [[Dire Straits]] song "[[Money for Nothing (song)|Money for Nothing]]" for use in the film ''[[UHF (film)|UHF]]'' on the provision that Knopfler himself be allowed to play lead guitar on the parody which was later titled "[[Money for Nothing/Beverly Hillbillies*]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0946148/bio|title=Biography for 'Weird Al' Yankovic|accessdate=September 15, 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071020193329/http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0946148/bio| archivedate= October 20, 2007&lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Yankovic commented on the legal complications of the parody in the DVD audio commentary for ''UHF'', explaining "We had to name that song 'Money for Nothing 'slash' Beverly Hillbillies 'asterisk' because the lawyers told us that had to be the name. Those wacky lawyers! What ya gonna do?"&lt;ref&gt;Al Yankovic, "UHF" DVD Audio Commentary (0:35:15)&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Permanent Record: Al in the Box]]'' booklet referred to the song's "compound fracture of a title."&lt;ref name="booklet"/&gt; When a fan asked about the song's title, Yankovic shared his feelings on the title, replying "That incredibly stupid name is what the lawyers insisted that the parody be listed as. I'm not sure why, and I've obviously never been very happy about it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weirdal.com/aaarchive.htm#1098|title="Ask Al" Q&amp;As for October, 1998|accessdate=September 15, 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070927203544/http://www.weirdal.com/aaarchive.htm| archivedate= September 27, 2007&lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Presidents of the United States of America (band)|The Presidents of the United States of America]] were so pleased with "Gump", Yankovic's parody of their song "Lump", that they ended the song with his last line instead of their own ("And that's all I have to say about that") on the live recording of "Lump" featured on the compilation album ''[[Pure Frosting]]''. In 2008, Yankovic directed the music video for their song "[[Mixed Up S.O.B.]]"

[[Don McLean]] was reportedly pleased with "[[The Saga Begins]]", a parody of "[[American Pie (song)|American Pie]]", and told Yankovic that the parody's lyrics sometimes enter his mind during live performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weirdal.com/aaarchive.htm#0999|title="Ask Al" Q&amp;As for September 1999|accessdate=October 29, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060902121655/http://www.weirdal.com/aaarchive.htm#0999|archivedate=September 2, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parody not only replicates the music from the original [[Don McLean]] song, but it replicates the multi-layered rhyming structure in the verses and chorus. Additionally, [[George Lucas]] loved the song and a [[Lucasfilm]] representative told Yankovic, "You should have seen the smile on his face."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theforce.net/jedicouncil/interview/weirdal.asp|title=TheForce.Net – Jedi Council|publisher=TheForce.Net|first=Chris|last=Knight|accessdate=August 24, 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061022180839/http://www.theforce.net/jedicouncil/interview/weirdal.asp| archivedate= October 22, 2006&lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chamillionaire]] was also very pleased, even putting Yankovic's parody "[[White &amp; Nerdy]]" (a parody of "[[Ridin']]") on his official [[MySpace]] page before it was on Yankovic's own page. Chamillionaire stated in an interview, "He's actually [[rapping]] pretty good on it, it's crazy [...] I didn't know he could rap like that. It's really an honor when he does that. [...] Weird Al is not gonna do a parody of your song if you're not doing it big."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/m/mixtape_monday/091106|title=MTVNews.com – Mixtape Monday: Lil Wayne, Juelz To Drop Real Album; Ness Drops Da Band|accessdate=October 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2007, Chamillionaire credited "White &amp; Nerdy" for his recent Grammy win, stating "That parody was the reason I won the Grammy, because it made the record so big it was undeniable. It was so big overseas that people were telling me they had heard my version of Weird Al's song."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/music/news/2007-09-16-chamillionaire_N.htm|title=Chamillionaire triumphs over cursing on 'Ultimate Victory'|first=Steve|last=Jones|work=USA Today|accessdate=September 20, 2007|date=September 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Yankovic was initially denied permission to parody [[Lady Gaga]]'s "[[Born This Way (song)|Born This Way]]" for his song "[[Perform This Way]]" for release on a new album, but through his release of the song on [[YouTube]] and subsequent spread via [[Twitter]], Lady Gaga and her staff asserted that her manager had made the decision without her input, and Gaga herself gave Yankovic permission to proceed with the parody's release.&lt;ref name="wired gaga"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/underwire/2011/06/weird-al-yankovic-alpocalypse|title=Alpocalypse Now: 'Weird Al' Yankovic Says 'Twitter Saved My Album'|first=Angela|last=Watercutter|date=June 20, 2011|accessdate=June 20, 2011|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gaga Saga"&gt;{{cite web|first=Alfred |last=Yankovic |title=The gaga saga |date=April 20, 2011 |url=http://alyankovic.wordpress.com/the-gaga-saga |accessdate=April 20, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5y61XzOga?url=http://alyankovic.wordpress.com/the-gaga-saga/ |archivedate=April 20, 2011 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaga considered herself "a huge Weird Al fan",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=TMZ.com|title=Lady Gaga – I Didn't Reject Weird Al Yankovic|publisher=TMZ.com|date=April 20, 2011|url=http://www.tmz.com/2011/04/20/weird-al-yankovic-lady-gaga-rejected-born-this-way-parody-perform-this-way|accessdate=April 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and she stated that the parody was a "rite of passage" for her musical career and considered the song "very empowering".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/videos/new-and-hot/lady-gaga-weird-al-parody-empowering-20110525|title=Lady Gaga – Weird Al parody 'empowering'|date=May 25, 2011|accessdate=June 20, 2011|work=Rolling Stone}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yankovic states that his style parodies have also been met with positive remarks by the original artist. He noted that his friends and fellow musicians [[Ben Folds]] and [[Taylor Hanson]] helped to support their respective style parodies "Why Does This Always Happen To Me?" and "If That Isn't Love". He also noted positive reactions he got through friends his band members have, such as from [[Frank Black]] of [[The Pixies]] for "First World Problems" and [[Southern Culture on the Skids]] for "Lame Claim to Fame", and a similar praise when he encountered [[Graham Nash]] of [[Crosby, Stills, and Nash]] on the street, and was able to play his recently completed "Mission Statement" for him.&lt;ref name="spin 2014"/&gt;

==== Negative ====
One of Yankovic's most controversial parodies was 1996's "[[Amish Paradise]]", based on "[[Gangsta's Paradise (song)|Gangsta's Paradise]]" by hip-hop artist [[Coolio]], which, in turn, was based on "[[Pastime Paradise]]" by [[Stevie Wonder]]. Reportedly, Coolio's label gave Yankovic the impression that Coolio had granted permission to record the parody, but Coolio maintains that he never did. While Coolio claimed he was upset, legal action never materialized, and Coolio accepted [[Royalties|royalty]] payments for the song. After this controversy, Yankovic has always made sure to speak directly with the artist of every song he parodied. At the [[XM Satellite Radio]] booth at the 2006 [[Consumer Electronics Show]] Yankovic and Coolio made peace. On his website, Yankovic wrote of this event, "I don't remember what we said to each other exactly, but it was all very friendly. I doubt I'll be invited to Coolio's next birthday party, but at least I can stop wearing that bulletproof vest to the mall."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weirdal.com/aaarchive.htm#042706 |title="Ask Al" Q&amp;As for April 27, 2006 |accessdate=September 2, 2006 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5gv2Zw4KL?url=http://www.weirdal.com/aaarchive.htm |archivedate=May 20, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview in 2014, Coolio extended his apology for refusing his permission, stating that at the time "I was being cocky and shit and being stupid and I was wrong and I should've embraced that shit and went with it", and that he considered Yankovic's parody "actually funny as shit".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =  http://noisey.vice.com/en_uk/blog/after-all-these-years-coolio-still-lets-his-nuts-hang | title = After All These Years, Coolio Still Lets His Nuts Hang | date = April 28, 2014 | accessdate  = July 15, 2014 | work = [[Vice (magazine)|Vice]] | first = Dan | last = Ozzi }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] bassist [[Flea (musician)|Flea]] told ''Behind the Music'' that he was unimpressed and disappointed by Yankovic's 1993 song "[[Bedrock Anthem]]", which parodied two of the band's songs. He was quoted as stating "I didn't think it was very good. I enjoy Weird Al's things, but I found it unimaginative."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Khanna|first=Vish|title="Weird Al" Yankovic Alpocalypse Now… and Then|url=http://exclaim.ca/Features/Timeline/weird_al_yankovic-alpocalypse_now8230_then/Page/7|accessdate=July 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weirdalforum.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=5673&amp;hl= |title=Reactions From Original Artists |publisher=Weirdalforum.com |date=October 8, 2006 |accessdate=June 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the ''[[Poodle Hat]]'' ''[[Al TV]]'' special, Yankovic raised the question of artistic expression in a fake interview with Eminem. As Yankovic has always done for his ''Al TV'' specials, he edited the footage of a previous Eminem interview and inserted himself asking questions for comic effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QOya9-lwQk|title="Weird Al" Yankovic – The Eminem Interview|accessdate=December 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Refused parodies ====
On numerous occasions, [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] refused Yankovic permission to record parodies of his songs. Yankovic had stated in interviews prior to Prince's death in 2016 that he had "approached him every few years [to] see if he's lightened up."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-oholicsanonymous.com/interviews/hotwired.txt|title="Weird Al" Yankovic Interview by Michael Small of Hotwired.com|accessdate=October 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yankovic related one story where, before the [[American Music Awards]] where he and Prince were assigned to sit in the same row, he got a telegram from Prince's management company, demanding he not make eye contact with the artist.&lt;ref name="wired gaga"/&gt; Among parodies that Yankovic had ideas for included one based on "[[Let's Go Crazy]]" about ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'', "[[1999 (song)|1999]]" as an [[infomercial]] with a call-in number ending in -1999, and parodies of "[[Kiss (Prince song)|Kiss]]" and "[[When Doves Cry]]".&lt;ref name="people aug2016"/&gt;

[[Led Zeppelin]] guitarist [[Jimmy Page]] is a self-proclaimed Yankovic fan, but when Yankovic wished to create a polka medley of Led Zeppelin songs, Page refused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weirdal.com/aaarchive.htm#0699|title="Ask Al" Q&amp;As for June, 1999|accessdate=October 27, 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061106023621/http://www.weirdal.com/aaarchive.htm| archivedate= November 6, 2006&lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yankovic was, however, allowed the opportunity to re-record a sample of "[[Black Dog (song)|Black Dog]]" for a segment of "[[Trapped in the Drive-Thru]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/weird-al-yankovic-dishes-on-james-blunt-discusses-his-role-as-the-whitest-nerdiest-rock-star-ever-20060919|title=Weird Al Yankovic Dishes On James Blunt, Discusses His Role As the Whitest, Nerdiest Rock Star Ever|accessdate=October 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul McCartney]], also a Yankovic fan, refused Yankovic permission to record a parody of [[Wings (band)|Wings]]' "[[Live and Let Die (song)|Live and Let Die]]", titled "Chicken Pot Pie", because, according to Yankovic, McCartney is "a strict vegetarian and he didn't want a parody that condoned the consumption of animal flesh".&lt;ref name="rs chicken pot pie"/&gt; Though McCartney suggested possibly changing the parody to "Tofu Pot Pie", Yankovic found this wouldn't fit around the chorus of the parody, based on making the sound of a chicken throughout it. While never recorded for an album, Yankovic did play parts of "Chicken Pot Pie" as part of a larger medley in several tours during the 1990s.&lt;ref name="rs chicken pot pie"/&gt;

In 2003, Yankovic was denied permission to make a video for "[[Couch Potato (song)|Couch Potato]]", his parody of [[Eminem]]'s "[[Lose Yourself]]".  Yankovic believes that Eminem thought that the video would be harmful to his image.&lt;ref name="KingOfPop"&gt;{{cite news|last=Thomas|first=Mike|title=Is the King of Pop losing it?|url=http://www.suntimes.com/output/entertainment/cst-ftr-jacko14.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041016051807/http://www.suntimes.com/output/entertainment/cst-ftr-jacko14.html|archivedate=October 16, 2004|work=Chicago Sun-Times

In 2006, Yankovic gained [[James Blunt]]'s permission to record a parody of "[[You're Beautiful]]". However, after Yankovic had recorded "[[You're Pitiful]]", Blunt's label, [[Atlantic Records]], rescinded this permission, despite Blunt's personal approval of the song.&lt;ref name="wired gaga"/&gt; The parody was pulled from Yankovic's ''[[Straight Outta Lynwood]]'' because of his label's unwillingness to "go to war" with Atlantic. Yankovic released the song as a free download on his MySpace profile, as well as his official website, and plays it in concert, since it was not Blunt himself objecting to the parody.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5482774|title=Free 'Weird Al' Yankovic!|accessdate=August 24, 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060820173526/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5482774| archivedate= August 20, 2006&lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Yankovic referenced the incident in his video for "White &amp; Nerdy" when he depicts himself vandalizing Atlantic Records' Wikipedia article.

Yankovic was considering a complete polka medley with only [[U2]] songs, but was denied the rights by the band.&lt;ref name="avbook book exerpt"/&gt; Similarly, he had included [[Weezer]]'s "[[Buddy Holly (song)|Buddy Holly]]" in a polka medley, but had to pull it when the band refused rights for it.&lt;ref name="avbook book exerpt"/&gt;

In 2003, Yankovic toured overseas for the first time. Before 2003, Yankovic and his band had toured only the United States and parts of Canada.&lt;ref name="livepage"/&gt; Following the success of ''[[Poodle Hat]]'' in Australia, Yankovic performed eleven shows in Australia's major capital cities and regional areas in October of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weirdal.com/phtour.htm|title="Weird Al" Yankovic: Poodle Hat 2003/04 tourdates|accessdate=November 10, 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061206003731/http://www.weirdal.com/phtour.htm| archivedate= December 6, 2006&lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yankovic returned to Australia and toured New Zealand for the first time in 2007 to support the ''[[Straight Outta Lynwood]]'' album. On September 8, 2007, Yankovic performed his 1,000th live show at [[Idaho Falls, Idaho]].&lt;ref name="livepage"/&gt;

Yankovic has invited members of the [[501st Legion]] on stage during performances of his ''Star Wars''-themed songs "[[Yoda (song)|Yoda]]" and "[[The Saga Begins]]", recruiting members of local garrisons (club chapters) while on tour. In appreciation, the 501st inducted Yankovic as a "Friend of the Legion", in September 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.501stlegion.org/news.php?archive=2007,9 |title=501st Legion.org--Archived News Sep 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110825230840/http://www.501st.com/news.php?archive=2007,9 |archive-date=August 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He performed his first ever European mini-tour, including an appearance at the [[All Tomorrow's Parties (music festival)|All Tomorrow's Parties]] music festival in [[Minehead]], England in December 2010. Yankovic was picked to perform by the Canadian band [[Godspeed You! Black Emperor]], who curated the festival's lineup. Yankovic played three other dates in the UK around his festival appearance before performing a single date in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weirdal.com/livepage.htm|title="Weird Al" live tour dates, 2010|accessdate=July 19, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131130124245/http://www.weirdal.com/livepage.htm|archivedate=November 30, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second concert film, ''[["Weird Al" Yankovic Live!: The Alpocalypse Tour]]'', aired on [[Comedy Central]] on October 1, 2011, and was released on Blu-ray and DVD three days later. The concert was filmed at [[Massey Hall]] in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]], Canada, during Yankovic's tour supporting the album ''Alpocalypse''. As before, video clips (apart from those for his own videos) and unreleased songs were edited out for legal reasons.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Weird-Al-Yankovic-Live-Alpocalypse/dp/product-description/B005FHHCWC/ref=dp_proddesc_0?ie=UTF8&amp;n=2625373011&amp;s=movies-tv&amp;qid=1312766492&amp;sr=8-1 "Weird Al" Yankovic Live! - The Alpocalypse Tour (2011)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Yankovic performed [[George Harrison]]'s ''[[What Is Life]]'' at the live-recorded [[George Fest]] (Los Angeles, 2014).

In 1989, Yankovic starred in a full-length feature film, co-written by himself and manager Jay Levey, and filmed in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]] called ''[[UHF (film)|UHF]]''. A satire of the television and film industries, also starring [[Michael Richards]], [[Fran Drescher]], and [[Victoria Jackson]], it brought floundering studio [[Orion Pictures|Orion]] their highest [[test screening|test scores]] since the movie ''[[RoboCop]]''.&lt;ref name="robo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weirdal.com/aaarchive.htm#0599 |title="Ask Al" Q&amp;As for May, 1999|accessdate=October 28, 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061106023621/http://www.weirdal.com/aaarchive.htm| archivedate= November 6, 2006&lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was unsuccessful in theaters due to both poor critical reception and competition from other summer blockbusters at the time such as ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]'', ''[[Lethal Weapon 2]]'', ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'' and ''[[Licence to Kill]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.avclub.com/article/weird-als-iuhf-iis-uneven-but-that-just-made-it-ah-81212 | title = Weird Al's UHF is uneven, but that just made it ahead of its time  | publisher = [[The A.V.

The film has since become a [[Cult film|cult classic]], with out-of-print copies of the VHS version selling for up to $100 on [[eBay]] until the release of the DVD in 2002.{{Citation needed|date = April 2011}} Yankovic occasionally shows clips from the film at his concerts (to which [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]], the film's current owner, initially objected in the form of a [[cease and desist]] letter).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weirdal.com/aaarchive.htm#0500 |title="Ask Al" Q&amp;As for May, 2000|accessdate=October 26, 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061106023621/http://www.weirdal.com/aaarchive.htm| archivedate= November 6, 2006&lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In an apparent attempt to make it more accessible to overseas audiences, where the term [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] is used less frequently to describe TV broadcasts, the film was titled ''[[UHF (film)|The Vidiot From UHF]]'' in Australia and parts of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098546/ |title=UHF (1989)|accessdate=October 26, 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061015173637/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098546/| archivedate= October 15, 2006&lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''UHF'' shows the creation of Yankovic's signature food—the Twinkie Wiener Sandwich. The snack consists of an overturned [[Twinkie]] split open as a makeshift bun, a [[hot dog]], and [[Easy Cheese]] put together and dipped in milk before eating. Yankovic has stated that he has switched to using [[tofu]] hot dogs since becoming a vegetarian, but still enjoys the occasional Twinkie Wiener Sandwich.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weirdal.com/aaarchive.htm#1095 |title=Midnight Star "Ask Al" Q&amp;As for October/November, 1995|accessdate=October 26, 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061106023621/http://www.weirdal.com/aaarchive.htm| archivedate= November 6, 2006&lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Live television ===
In his early career, Yankovic hosted the specials ''[[Al TV]]'' on MTV and ''Al Music'' on [[MuchMusic]] many times, generally coinciding with the release of each new album. These shows typically included some of Yankovic's videos to date and previews of songs on the upcoming A recurring segment of ''Al TV'' involves Yankovic manipulating interviews for comic effect. He inserts himself into a previously conducted interview with a musician, and then manipulates his questions, resulting in bizarre and comic responses from the celebrity.

''[[The Weird Al Show]]'' was a live action skit-based children's show hosted by Yankovic, airing from September to December 1997 on [[CBS]], which featured several actors and bands as guests along with Yankovic and other actors. It was designed to be part of CBS's mandated [[E/I|Educational or Informative]] programming to teach children morals. The show had a troubled production due to this requirement and the desire by CBS to follow in the success of ''[[Pee-wee's Playhouse]]'', leading to the show's cancellation after one 13-episode season. The entire series was released on DVD by [[Shout! Factory]] on August 15, 2006.

[[VH1]] produced a ''[[Behind the Music]]'' episode on Yankovic. His two commercial failures (his film ''[[UHF (film)|UHF]]'' and his 1986 album ''[[Polka Party!]]'') were presented as having a larger impact on the direction of his career than they really had. Also, [[Coolio]]'s later disapproval of "[[Amish Paradise]]" was played up as a large feud. Much was also made over his apparent lack of a love life, though he got married shortly after the program aired. The episode was updated and re-released in early 2012 as part of the "Behind the Music Remastered" series.

Yankovic performed at the [[66th Primetime Emmy Awards]] singing a comedic medley of songs based on the themes of several Emmy-nominated shows such as ''[[Mad Men]]'' and ''[[Game of Thrones]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.vulture.com/2014/08/watch-weird-al-emmys-tv-theme-song-medley.html | title = Watch Weird Al's Emmys TV Theme-Song Medley | first = Gilbert | last = Cruz | date = August 25, 2014 | accessdate=  August 25, 2014 | work = [[Vulture (blog)|Vulture]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Animation and voice work ===
Yankovic has done voice-overs for several animated series. He appeared in a 2003 episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', singing "The Ballad of Homer &amp; Marge" (a parody of [[John Mellencamp]]'s "[[Jack &amp; Diane]]") with his band. The episode, "[[Three Gays of the Condo]]", in which [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] hires Yankovic to sing the aforementioned song to [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] in an attempt to reconcile their marriage, later won an [[Emmy Award]] for "Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming Less Than One Hour)". Yankovic also had a cameo in a 2008 episode, titled "[[That '90s Show]]", during which he records a parody of Homer's grunge hit "Shave Me" titled "Brain Freeze" (Homer's song, "Shave Me", was itself a parody of [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s "[[Rape Me]]") making Yankovic one of only a handful of celebrities to appear twice on the show playing themselves.

He appeared in the animated [[Adult Swim]] show ''[[Robot Chicken]]'', which provided him with a music video for the song "Weasel Stomping Day".&lt;ref name="adult"&gt;{{cite AV media | url=http://video.adultswim.com/robot-chicken/weasel-stomping-day.html | title=Weasel Stomping Day | publisher=[[Adult Swim]] | medium=[[Cartoon Network]] | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120514060537/http://video.adultswim.com/robot-chicken/weasel-stomping-day.html | archivedate=May 14, 2012 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://humor.about.com/od/comediansr/a/weird_al_qa_2.htm | title="Weird Al" Yankovic: An Interview About Humor | publisher=[[About.com]] | accessdate=April 8, 2012 | author=Durrett, Mike | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205193149/http://humor.about.com/od/comediansr/a/weird_al_qa_2.htm | archivedate=February 5, 2012 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Yankovic is the voice for [[List of characters in The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy#Toadblatt's Summer School of Sorcery|Squid Hat]] on the [[Cartoon Network]] show, ''[[The Grim Adventures of Billy &amp; Mandy]]''.

[[Eric Appel]] produced a ''[[Funny or Die]]'' movie trailer for ''Weird: The Al Yankovic Story'', a fictional [[biographical film]] that parodies other films based on musicians; Yankovic (played by [[Aaron Paul]]) is seen hiding his "weirdness" from his parents ([[Gary Cole]] and [[Mary Steenburgen]]), making it big using song parodies with the help of Dr. Demento ([[Patton Oswalt]]), falling in and out of love with Madonna ([[Olivia Wilde]]), and fading into alcoholism and being arrested, at which point his father finally admits he is "weird" as well.

Yankovic stated that the idea for the book was based on his own "circuitous" career path.&lt;ref name="cnn book"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.cnn.com/2011/LIVING/02/01/weird.al.book/ | title = What happened when Weird Al grew up | first = Ann | last = Hoevel | date = February 1, 2011 | accessdate =February 1, 2011 | publisher = CNN }}&lt;/ref&gt; The book allows Yankovic to apply the humorous writing style found in his music in another medium, allowing him to use puns and rhymes.&lt;ref name="cnn book"/&gt; Yankovic worked with Harper Collins' editor Anne Hoppe—the first time that Yankovic has had an editor—and found her help to be a positive experience.&lt;ref name="cnn book"/&gt; The book is illustrated by Wes Hargis, who, according to Yankovic, has "a childlike quality and a very fun quality and a very imaginative quality" that matched well with Yankovic's writing.&lt;ref name="cnn book"/&gt; The book reached the No. 4 position on [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]] for Children's Picture Books for the week of February 20, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/2011-02-20/picture-books/list.html | title = Children's Picture Books – Feb. 20, 2011 |work=New York Times | accessdate =February 12, 2011 | first=Jennifer | last=Schuessler}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yankovic also wrote a sequel to ''When I Grow Up'', 2013's ''My New Teacher and Me!''&lt;!-- Release date June 25, 2013 --&gt;

Yankovic became the first guest editor for ''[[Mad Magazine]]'' for their 533rd issue, published in April 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/comic-riffs/wp/2015/02/13/mad-magazine-names-its-first-guest-editor-in-its-seven-decade-history-weird-al-yankovic/ | title = MAD magazine names its first guest editor in its seven-decade history: ‘Weird Al’ Yankovic | first = Michael | last = Cavna | date = February 13, 2015 | accessdate = March 1, 2015 | work = [[Washington Post]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other media ===
Yankovic competed on a week of ''[[Wheel of Fortune (U.S. game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'' taped at [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]] in March 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/orlandosentinel/access/77962431.html?dids=77962431:77962431&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Mar+01%2C+1994&amp;author=&amp;pub=Orlando+Sentinel&amp;desc=WHEEL+OF+FORTUNE%27+SPINS+INTO+O-TOWN&amp;pqatl=google |title=Archives |publisher=Pqasb.pqarchiver.com |date=March 1, 1994 |accessdate=April 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also competed on ''[[Rock &amp; Roll Jeopardy!]]''

Weird Al joined the band [[Hanson (band)|Hanson]] in their music video for "[[Thinking 'bout Somethin']]" in which he plays the tambourine.

Yankovic contributes backing vocals for the song "Time" on [[Ben Folds]]' album ''[[Songs for Silverman]]''.

Yankovic was also one of many celebrities who took part in the [[NOH8 Campaign]] against [[California Proposition 8|Proposition 8]], which banned [[same-sex marriage]] in California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.noh8campaign.com/photo-gallery/familiar-faces/photo/5622 |title=Familiar Faces |publisher=NOH8 Campaign |date=February 1, 2010 |accessdate=August 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yankovic was approached by a beer company to endorse their product.  Yankovic had turned it down because he believed that "a lot of my fans were young and impressionable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vintagevinylnews.com/2010/11/weird-al-yankovic-regrets-turning-down.html |title=Weird Al Yankovic Talks About Beer Endorsement He Turned Down |publisher=MOG Campaign |date=November 26, 2010 |accessdate=November 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Yankovic later posted on his Twitter account that he never regretted the decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|user=alyankovic|author=Al Yankovic|number=8100855014236160|date=November 26, 2010|title=This headline is inaccurate – I NEVER regretted the decision. It’s just a bummer to turn down that much money, you know? http://j.mp/i5GEQn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Yankovic was a special guest on an episode of [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4]]'s ''[[Web Soup]]'' where he came as [[Mark Gormley]] at first.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|bxFMyuASO8g|Weird Al Yankovic Melts Down on Web Soup}} (uploaded December 11, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Yankovic guest starred as the character "Banana Man" in an episode of ''[[Adventure Time]]''.  The same year, he appeared as himself in the ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]'' episode "[[Noretta]]".

In 2012, he appeared as himself along with [[Alice Cooper]], [[Bret Michaels]], and [[Maria Menounos]] in ''[[The High Fructose Adventures of Annoying Orange]]'' for the Christmas special, and sung with Alice, Bret, and Orange.

On May 31, 2014, Yankovic won the ACE Award (Amateur Cartoonist Extraordinaire) from the National Cartoonists Society at its awards banquet in San Diego.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reuben.org/2014/05/2014-ncs-awards-winners/ ''68th Annual Reuben Awards results'']&lt;/ref&gt;

== Misattribution and imitators ==
[[File:WeirdAlLimeWire.png|thumb|A screenshot of [[LimeWire]] PRO, showing a large number of parodies misattributed to Yankovic, as well as numerous misspellings of his surname ({{start date|2007|02}})]]
Songs posted to [[file sharing]] networks are often misattributed to him because of their humorous subject matter.  Often, his surname is misspelled (and thus mispronounced) as "Yankovich", among other variations. Much to the disdain of Yankovic, these misattributed files include songs that are racist, sexually explicit, or otherwise offensive. A young listener who had heard several of these offensive tracks by way of a file sharing service confronted Yankovic online, threatening a boycott because of his supposedly explicit lyrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weirdal.com/aaarchive.htm#100205 |title="Ask Al" Q&amp;As for October 2, 2005 |accessdate=August 24, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010626120633/http://www.weirdal.com/aaarchive.htm |archivedate=June 26, 2001 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Quite a few of the songs, such as "[[Star Wars Cantina (song)#Parody song|Star Wars Cantina]]" by [[Mark Jonathan Davis]] (not, in a double misattribution, his lounge-singer character [[Richard Cheese]]), "[[Star Wars Gangsta Rap]]", "Yoda Smokes Weed", "Chewbacca", "[[The Devil Went Down to Georgia#Parody song|The Devil Went To Jamaica]]", "[[The Twelve Pains of Christmas]]" by [[Bob Rivers]] and several more have a ''[[Star Wars]]'' motif.&lt;ref name="notalpage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://free.house.cx/~eil/etc/notal_list.html   |title=The Not Al Page: The most popular songs he didn't even write (or perform)!|accessdate=December 29, 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080728111957/http://free.house.cx/~eil/etc/notal_list.html |archivedate = July 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some songs misattributed to him are not songs, but spoken skits, such as "[[Sesame Street]] on crack", which is also widely misattributed to [[Adam Sandler]]. A list of songs frequently misattributed to Yankovic can be found at The Not Al Page&lt;ref name="notalpage"/&gt; and a list of all commercially released songs recorded by Yankovic can be found on his website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weirdal.com/archives/miscellaneous/recording-dates/ |title=Recording Dates Page|accessdate=December 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yankovic cites these misattributions as "his only real beef with [[peer-to-peer]] [[file sharing]] sites":
{{Quote|If you do a search for my name on any one of those sites, I guarantee you that about half of the songs that come up will be songs I had absolutely nothing to do with. That particularly bothers me, because I really try to do quality work, and I also try to maintain a more-or-less family-friendly image—and some of these songs that are supposedly by me are just, well, vulgar and awful. I truly think my reputation has suffered in a lot of people's minds because of all those fake Weird Al songs floating around the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itworld.com/060918download |title=Don't not download this song|accessdate=September 23, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In an episode of [[HBO]]'s ''[[Mr. Show with Bob and David]]'' called "[[Rudy Will Await Your Foundation]]", [[Bob Odenkirk]] plays a character called Daffy "Mal" Yinkleyankle, a parody of Weird Al. Al, who claims it was the only genuine parody act on himself he has ever seen, told Odenkirk in an email that he was "flattered, in a weird way" and "found it very funny".&lt;ref name="AVC"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/weird-al-yankovic,14163/ | title=Interview: "Weird Al" Yankovic | publisher=[[The A.V.

== Fan-driven campaigns ==
The Weird Al Star Fund is a campaign started by Yankovic's fans to get him a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]. Their mission is to "solicit, collect, and raise the necessary money, and to compile the information needed for the application to nominate "Weird Al" Yankovic for a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame."&lt;ref name="starfund"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weirdalstar.com/ |title=The Hollywood Walk of Fame Star Campaign for "Weird Al" Yankovic |accessdate=March 15, 2007 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5mqzqsQen?url=http://www.weirdalstar.com/ |archivedate=January 17, 2010 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fans worldwide have sent donations to raise the US$15,000 needed for a nomination. In addition to the preferred method of cash donations, many methods were used to raise money for the cause, such as a live benefit show held April 11, 2006, and selling merchandise on the official website and [[eBay]], including T-shirts, calendars, and cookbooks.&lt;ref name="cook"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weirdalstar.com/tributeshow.html |title=The Hollywood Walk of Fame Star Campaign for "Weird Al" Yankovic|accessdate =October 29, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 26, 2006, the campaign hit the then-$15,000 target, just five days before the May 31 deadline to submit the necessary paperwork.&lt;ref name="starfund"/&gt; However, Yankovic was not included on the list of inductees for 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/article/index.jsp?uuid=8ce9efb9-2eb5-4f61-85ab-c5c2ffb9d885 |title=Damon, Diddy, Ponch Got Star Power |first=Gina |last=Serpe |publisher=E!

Yankovic's application was resubmitted for consideration in 2007, but he was not included among 2008's inductees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodtoday.net/?p=1129 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928032853/http://www.hollywoodtoday.net/?p=1129 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=September 28, 2007 |title=New Stars to Grace Hollywood Walk of Fame |accessdate=July 2, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce announced in June 2017 that Yankovic will receive a star on the Walk of Fame as part of the 2018 inductees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.avclub.com/article/weird-al-yankovic-getting-star-hollywood-walk-fame-257220 | title = "Weird Al" Yankovic is getting a star on the Hollywood Walk Of Fame | first = William | last = Hughes | date  = June 22, 2017 | accessdate = June 22, 2017 | work = [[The A.V.

Similar to the Weird Al Star Fund, a second fan-driven campaign called "Make the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame|Rock Hall]] 'Weird'" has tried to enshrine him into Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], for which he has been eligible since 2004.&lt;ref name="rockhallgoal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allthingsyank.com/rockhall/goal.htm |title=Make the Rock Hall "Weird" – Our Mission|accessdate=June 15, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080723161416/http://www.allthingsyank.com/rockhall/goal.htm| archivedate= July 23, 2008&lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Previous attempts to raise awareness for the campaign and support Yankovic's nomination included a petition drive from 2006 to 2007, which raised over 9000 signatures; an art competition in 2005; additionally, a documentary film about the campaign is currently being developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allthingsyank.com/rockhall/faq.htm |title=Make the Rock Hall "Weird" – FAQ|accessdate=June 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rockhallhelp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allthingsyank.com/rockhall/what.htm |title=Make the Rock Hall "Weird" – How You Can Help|accessdate=June 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to these efforts, an ongoing campaign is underway in which supporters of Yankovic's nomination are requested to send "sincere, thoughtful" letters to the Rock Hall Foundation's headquarters in New York.&lt;ref name="rockhallhelp"/&gt;  The Hall has not considered Yankovic for nomination since the campaign started in 2004.&lt;ref name="rockhallgoal"/&gt; A 2009 ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' poll named Weird Al as the top artist that should be nominated for the Hall of Fame, followed by [[Rush (band)|Rush]] (who were inducted in 2013) and [[The Moody Blues]] in the top ten."&lt;ref name = "RSList"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.rollingstone.com/music/daily-blog/blogs/rsstaffblogpost_2011/45550/39509 | title = Readers' Rock List: Who Should Be Nominated For the Hall of Fame?|work=Rolling Stone | date = September 29, 2009 | accessdate =June 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A smaller ongoing effort has been made by fans to have Yankovic perform at the halftime show of a [[Super Bowl]] game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://newsfeed.time.com/2012/02/13/five-reasons-weird-al-yankovic-should-perform-at-next-years-super-bowl/   | title = Five Reasons 'Weird Al' Yankovic Should Perform at Next Year's Super Bowl | first = Melissa | last = Lockar | date = February 13, 2012 | accessdate = July 23, 2014 | work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; This inspired Yankovic to write the [[fight song]] parody "Sports Song" for ''Mandatory Fun'' to help round out his repertoire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://kroq.cbslocal.com/weird-al-yankovic-on-mandatory-fun-super-bowl-halftime-show-uhf-geeking-out-on-paul-mccartney/ | title = 'Weird Al' Yankovic on ''Mandatory Fun'' | publisher = [[CBS]] | date = July 18, 2014 | accessdate = July 23, 2014 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140722070225/http://kroq.cbslocal.com/weird-al-yankovic-on-mandatory-fun-super-bowl-halftime-show-uhf-geeking-out-on-paul-mccartney/ | archive-date = July 22, 2014 | dead-url = yes | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent to the success of ''Mandatory Fun'', another fan-driven campaign pushed for Yankovic to headline the then-upcoming [[Super Bowl XLIX]] at the highlight of the artist's career, which was noticed by many media outlets, including [[CNN]] and [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]], though the decision for this selection would reside within the management of the [[NFL]] (who instead chose [[Katy Perry]] for that position).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/07/showbiz/celebrity-news-gossip/weird-al-yankovic-super-bowl-halftime/ | title = Fans backing Weird Al for Super Bowl halftime | first = Todd | last = Leopold | date = August 7, 2014 | accessdate = August 7, 2014 | publisher = CNN }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ajc.com/news/entertainment/weird-al-super-bowl-xlix-what-are-chances/ngx2S/ | title = 'Weird Al' at Super Bowl XLIX: What are the chances? | work = [[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]] |  date = August 8, 2014 | accessdate = August 8, 2014 | first = Christian | last =Bryant }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.wired.com/2014/08/weird-al-super-bowl-petition/ | title=You Can Help Weird Al Headline the Super Bowl's Halftime Show | publisher=Condé Nast | date=August 7, 2014 | accessdate=August 12, 2014 | author=Watercutter, Angela}}&lt;/ref&gt;
