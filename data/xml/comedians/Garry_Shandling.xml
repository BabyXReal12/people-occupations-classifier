'''Garry Emmanuel Shandling''' (November 29, 1949 – March 24, 2016) was an American stand-up comedian, actor, director, writer, and producer. He was best known for his work in ''[[It's Garry Shandling's Show]]'' and ''[[The Larry Sanders Show]]''.

Shandling began his career writing for sitcoms, such as ''[[Sanford and Son]]'' and ''[[Welcome Back, Kotter]]''. He made a successful stand-up performance on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' and became a frequent guest-host on the series. Shandling was for a time considered the leading contender to replace [[Johnny Carson]] (other hopefuls were [[Joan Rivers]], [[David Letterman]], and [[David Brenner]]). In 1986, he created ''It's Garry Shandling's Show'' for [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]]. It was nominated for four [[Emmy Award]]s (including one for Shandling) and lasted until 1990. His second show titled ''The Larry Sanders Show'', which began airing on [[HBO]] in 1992, was even more successful. Shandling was nominated for 18 Emmy Awards for the show and won the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series]] in 1998, along with [[Peter Tolan]], for writing the series finale. In film, he had a recurring role in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], appearing in ''[[Iron Man 2]]'' and ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]''. He also lent his voice to Verne the turtle in ''[[Over the Hedge (film)|Over the Hedge]]''. Shandling's final performance was as the voice of Ikki in the live-action remake of ''[[The Jungle Book (2016 film)|The Jungle Book]]''.

During his three-decade career, Shandling was nominated for 19 Primetime Emmy Awards and two [[Golden Globe Award]]s, along with many other awards and nominations. He served as host of the [[Grammy Award]]s four times and as host of the [[Emmy Award]]s three times.

==Career==
After graduation from [[Palo Verde High School (Arizona)|Palo Verde High School]],&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; he attended the [[University of Arizona]] in Tucson, majoring in [[electrical engineering]] for three years. One day after leaving a laboratory class for a drink of water, he couldn't bear rejoining the class.&lt;ref name="true-lies-19940908" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FoundationINTERVIEWS1" /&gt; He eventually completed a degree in marketing and pursued a year of [[postgraduate studies]] in creative writing,&lt;ref name=variety&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/garry-shandling-dead-larry-sanders-show-show-1201738601|title=Garry Shandling Dies at 66|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety.com]]|first=Alex|last=Stedman|date=March 24, 2016|accessdate=March 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and contributed humorous articles to small magazines.&lt;ref name="FoundationINTERVIEWS1" /&gt;

When he was nineteen, he drove two hours to a club in Phoenix, where he showed some jokes to George Carlin, who was appearing. The next day, on a repeat round-trip, Carlin told him that he had funny stuff on every page and should keep at it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/sarah-larson/lots-of-love-for-garry-shandling|title=Lots of Love for Garry Shandling|first=Sarah|last=Larson|date=March 25, 2016|publisher=|accessdate=April 8, 2018|via=www.newyorker.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FoundationINTERVIEWS1" &gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvwyLSwR51c|title=Garry Shandling Interview Part 1 of 2 - EMMYTVLEGENDS.ORG|first=|last=FoundationINTERVIEWS|date=March 25, 2016|publisher=Archive of American Television|accessdate=April 8, 2018|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FoundationINTERVIEWS2" &gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR-I_lxGG2k|title=Garry Shandling Interview Part 2 of 2 - EMMYTVLEGENDS.ORG|first=|last=FoundationINTERVIEWS|date=March 25, 2016|publisher=Archive of American Television|accessdate=April 8, 2018|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/03/garry-shandling-death-anniversary-jeffrey-tambor|title=One Year Later, Comedy’s Still Mourning Garry Shandling|first=Donald|last=Liebenson|date=|website=vanityfair.com|accessdate=April 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, Shandling moved to Los Angeles. He worked at an [[advertising agency]] for a time, took a script writing class, wrote a [[Spec script|speculative script]] with the son of a script writer, and then sold a script for the popular [[NBC]] sitcom ''[[Sanford and Son]]''.&lt;ref name=deadline&gt;{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2016/03/comedian-writer-actor-and-producer-gary-shandling-dies-at-66-1201726026|title=Garry Shandling Dies: ‘Larry Sanders’ Creator-Star Was 66|first=Ross A.|last=Lincoln|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=March 24, 2016|accessdate=March 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to ''Sanford and Son'', Shandling wrote scripts for the sitcoms ''[[Welcome Back, Kotter]]'' and attended a story meeting for ''[[Three's Company]]''.&lt;ref name=news&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.upi.com/Odd_News/2002/12/25/Cathys-World-Garry-Shandlings-Larry/52871040860003|title=Cathy's World: Garry Shandling's 'Larry'|accessdate=December 25, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1970s, Shandling was in an improv group with [[Paul Willson]].&lt;ref&gt;DVD commentary from ''It's Garry Shandling's Show'', season 2, episode 18, "No Baby, No Show"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FoundationINTERVIEWS1" /&gt;

In 1977, Shandling was involved in an auto accident in [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]] that left him in critical condition for two days and hospitalized for 2 weeks with a crushed spleen.&lt;ref name=people /&gt;  During his hospital stay he had a life changing near death experience. Shandling stated, "I had a vivid near-death experience that involved a voice asking, "Do you want to continue leading Garry Shandling's life?" Without thinking, I said, "Yes." Since then, I've been stuck living in the physical world while knowing, without a doubt, that there's something much more meaningful within it all. That realization is what drives my life and work."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/interviews/a1949/esq0103-jan-shandling/|title=What I've Learned: Garry Shandling|date=2007-01-29|work=Esquire|access-date=2018-07-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The accident inspired him to pursue a career as a comedian,&lt;ref name=goes-dark&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/31/magazine/garry-shandling-goes-dark.html|title=Garry Shandling Goes Dark|first=Lynn|last=Hirschberg|work=The New York Times|date=May 31, 1998|accessdate=March 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he later turned the accident into part of his comedy.&lt;ref name=billboard /&gt;

===Stand-up comedy===
Shandling became a stand-up comedian because, one day at a story meeting for "[[Three's Company]],"  one of the producers had complained, "Well, Chrissie wouldn't say that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2012/09/catching-up-with-david-mirkin.html|title=Catching up with David Mirkin|author=|date=|website=pastemagazine.com|accessdate=April 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[David Mirkin]]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"I just locked, I said, 'I don't think I can do this.' And I stopped right there and went on to perform." - Shandling&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.upi.com/Cathys-World-Garry-Shandlings-Larry/52871040860003/|title=Cathy's World: Garry Shandling's 'Larry'|author=|date=|website=upi.com|accessdate=April 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1978, Shandling performed his first stand-up routine at the [[The Comedy Store|Comedy Store]] in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]. A year later, Shandling was one of the few performers to cross the picket line when a group of comedians organized a boycott against the Comedy Store, protesting owner [[Mitzi Shore]]'s policy of not paying comedians to perform. According to [[William Knoedelseder]], Shandling "was the scion of a family with ... decidedly antiunion views. He had not shared the struggling comic experience. He was a successful sitcom writer trying to break into stand-up, and prior to the strike, Shore had refused to put him in the regular lineup because she didn't think he was good enough. Of course, that changed the minute he crossed the picket line."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Knoedelseder|first=William|year=2009|title=I'm Dying Up Here: Heartbreak and High Times in Stand-Up Comedy's Golden Era|publisher=Public Affairs Books|location=New York|pages=205–06|isbn=1-58648-896-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His persona was an anxiety-ridden, grimacing, guarded, confused man on the verge of losing control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://forward.com/culture/336992/why-garry-shandling-was-one-of-the-greatest-jewish-comedians-ever/|title=Why Garry Shandling Was One of the Greatest Jewish Comedians Ever|author=|date=|website=forward.com|accessdate=April 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a couple of years on the road, a talent scout from ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' booked him to appear as a guest in 1981.

In 1984, Shandling performed his first stand-up special ''Garry Shandling: Alone in Vegas'' for [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Erickson|first=Hal|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/62749/Garry-Shandling-Alone-in-Las-Vegas/overview|title= Garry Shandling: Alone in Las Vegas (1984)|publisher=[[All Movie Guide]]|accessdate=June 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by a second televised special in 1986 titled ''The Garry Shandling Show: 25th Anniversary Special'', also for Showtime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0363631|title=The Garry Shandling Show: 25th Anniversary Special (1986)|publisher=IMDB.com|accessdate= June 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, a third special titled ''Garry Shandling: Stand-Up'' was part of the ''[[HBO]] Comedy Hour''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://tv.nytimes.com/show/48296/Garry-Shandling-Stand-Up/details|title=Garry Shandling: Stand-Up|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=June 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television series===
====''It's Garry Shandling's Show''====
In 1985, Shandling and [[Alan Zweibel]] went on to create ''[[It's Garry Shandling's Show]]''. Through 1990, it ran for 72 episodes on [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]]. The edited reruns played on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] beginning in 1988.&lt;ref name=dollying /&gt; Shandling wrote 15 episodes of the series.

The series subverted the standard sitcom format by having its characters openly acknowledge that they were all part of a television series. Building on a concept that harked back to ''[[The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show]]'', in which [[George Burns]] would frequently break the "[[fourth wall]]" and speak directly to the audience, Shandling's series went so far as to incorporate the audience and elements of the studio itself into the storylines, calling attention to the artifice of the show.&lt;ref name=variety /&gt;&lt;ref name=dollying&gt;{{cite web|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2009/oct/20/entertainment/et-shandling20|title=Dollying through that fourth wall on 'It's Garry Shandling's Show': The funny guy deconstructed the sitcom on his Showtime series, which is newly out on DVD|first=Robert|last=Lloyd|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=October 20, 2009|accessdate=March 24, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160408040027/http://articles.latimes.com/2009/oct/20/entertainment/et-shandling20|archive-date=April 8, 2016|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eddieonfilm.blogspot.com/2010/09/garry-called-me-up-and-asked-if-i-would.html|title=Edward Copeland's Tangents: Garry called me up and asked if I would write this 25th anniversary tribute|first=Edward|last=Copel|date=|website=eddieonfilm.blogspot.com|accessdate=April 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series was nominated for four Emmy Awards,&lt;ref name=variety /&gt; including one for Shandling. He won an American Comedy Award for Funniest Male Performance in a Series, and won four CableACE awards, two for Best Comedy Series. The show also won an award for [[TCA Award for Outstanding Achievement in Comedy|Outstanding Achievement in Comedy]] from the [[Television Critics Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tvcritics.org/tca-awards|title=Past winners of the TCA Awards|publisher=[[Television Critics Association]]|accessdate=March 24, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160401233500/http://tvcritics.org/tca-awards/|archive-date=April 1, 2016|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''The Larry Sanders Show''====
[[File:Garry Shandling (2077238844).jpg|thumb|upright|Shandling during the 1994 Emmy Awards rehearsals]]

In 1992, Shandling launched another critical and commercial success by creating the mock behind-the-scenes talk show sitcom ''[[The Larry Sanders Show]]''. It was inspired by "It's Garry Shandling's Show." Season 4 Episode 2 "Take My Wife, for Example"&lt;ref name="FoundationINTERVIEWS1" /&gt; It ran for 89 episodes through to 1998 on [[HBO]]. It garnered 56 [[Emmy Award]] nominations and three wins. Shandling based the series on his experiences guest hosting ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Garry and Larry and Jeffrey and Hank|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/31/arts/television/31sanders.html|first=Dave|last=Itzkoff|work=The New York Times|date=October 29, 2010|accessdate=March 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, NBC offered Shandling $5 million to take over ''[[Late Night with David Letterman|Late Night]]'' when [[David Letterman]] announced his highly publicized move to [[CBS]], but Shandling declined.&lt;ref name=variety /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carter|first=Bill|title=The War For Late Night|year=2010|isbn=0-452-29749-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WUyzf2cJzu8C&amp;pg=PT47|accessdate=March 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was subsequently offered ''[[The Late Late Show (CBS TV series)|The Late Late Show]]'', but also declined in favor of continuing ''The Larry Sanders Show''.&lt;ref name=variety /&gt;

Shandling wrote 38 episodes of the series and directed three in the series' final season. He was nominated for 18 Emmy Awards for the series;&lt;ref name="variety" /&gt; five for acting, seven for writing, and six for being co-executive producer with [[Brad Grey]].&lt;ref name=goes-dark /&gt; He won one Emmy Award for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series|Outstanding Writing in a Comedy Series]] for the series finale "[[List of The Larry Sanders Show episodes#Season Six|Flip]]." He has also been nominated for two [[Golden Globe Award]]s for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Television Series Musical or Comedy|Best Actor (Musical or Comedy)]] in 1994 and 1995. He won two [[American Comedy Awards]] for Funniest Male Performance in a Comedy Series, eight [[CableACE Award]]s, and a [[BAFTA Award]].&lt;ref name="deadline" /&gt; The series also influenced other shows, such as ''[[Entourage (U.S. TV series)|Entourage]]'', ''[[30 Rock]]'', and ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'', in which guest stars portray themselves in episodes of the series.&lt;ref name="obsession"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/28/arts/television/28stei.html|title=Hey Now: It's Garry Shandling’s Obsession|first=Jacques|last=Steinberg|work=The New York Times|date=January 28, 2007|accessdate=March 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first season was re-released in 2007, along with a ''Not Just the Best of the Larry Sanders Show'', which were Shandling's pick of the best 23 episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2007/04/12/not-just-best-larry-sanders-show|title=Not Just the Best of The Larry Sanders Show|publisher=Entertainment Weekly|website= EW.com|accessdate=March 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was reunited with co-stars [[Rip Torn]], [[Jeffrey Tambor]], [[Sarah Silverman]], [[Penny Johnson Jerald]], [[Wallace Langham]], and [[Mary Lynn Rajskub]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2012/10/12/reunions-2012-garry-shandling-larry-sanders-show|title='Larry Sanders' reunion|publisher=Entertainment Weekly|website= EW.com|accessdate=March 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexual harassment allegations===
In 1994, when Shandling and his fiancée [[Linda Doucett]] ended their relationship, Shandling had her dismissed from ''The Larry Sanders Show''. Doucett filed a lawsuit against Shandling and Brad Grey's production company, [[Brillstein Entertainment Partners]], for [[sexual harassment]] and wrongful termination. The case was settled out of court in 1997 for $1&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/19/weekinreview/19halb.html?_r=1|work=The New York Times|first1=Allison Hope|last1=Weiner|first2=David M.|last2=Halbfinger|title=Splitting Up, Hollywood-Style, Means a Settlement and a Script|date=March 19, 2006|accessdate=March 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hollywood Harassment: I Was Fired from a Hit Show and Intimidated By Lawyers|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/hollywood-harassment-i-was-fired-a-hit-show-intimidated-by-lawyers-guest-column-1053465|website=hollywoodreporter.com|publisher=The Hollywood Reporter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2017, television writer [[Janis Hirsch]], who wrote for ''[[It's Garry Shandling's Show]]'', alleged that another actor put his genitals on her shoulder in front of Shandling while in his office and nothing was done to reprimand the actor. Of Shandling, Hirsch wrote "Garry presided over a misogynistic writers room, where women (well, woman: it was just me) were called slits".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/i-worked-garry-shandling-judd-apatow-s-doc-shows-a-man-i-never-knew-guest-column-1097157|title=I Worked for Garry Shandling, and Judd Apatow’s Doc Shows a Man I Never Knew (Guest Column)|last=Hirsch|first=Janis|date=March 26, 2018|website=hollywoodreporter.com|publisher=The Hollywood Reporter|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vulture.com/2017/10/sitcom-writer-recalls-harassment-on-garry-shandlings-show.html|title=Sitcom Writer Janis Hirsch Recalls Being Harassed and Humiliated While Working on It’s Garry Shandling’s Show|last=Wright|first=Tolly|date=October 18, 2017|website=vulture.com|publisher=Vulture|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shandling suffered from [[hyperparathyroidism]], a condition that can be fatal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/04/garry-shandling-hyperparathyroidism/476445/|title=Garry Shandling and the Disease You Didn't Know About|last=Fallows|first=James|date=|website=theatlantic.com|accessdate=April 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/all/2016/04/the-parathyroid-papers-garry-shandling-and-a-little-known-disease/476646/|title=The Parathyroid Papers: Garry Shandling and a Little-Known Disease|last=Fallows|first=James|date=|website=theatlantic.com|accessdate=April 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
