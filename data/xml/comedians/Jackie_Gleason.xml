'''John Herbert Gleason''' (February 26, 1916{{snds}}June 24, 1987) was an American comedian, actor, writer, composer and conductor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IMDB: Jackie Gleason|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001276/|website=imdb.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011155716/http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001276/|archivedate=October 11, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Developing a style and characters from growing up in [[Brooklyn]], New York, he was known for his brash visual and verbal comedy, exemplified by his bus driver [[Ralph Kramden]] character in the television series ''[[The Honeymooners]]''. By filming the episodes with [[Electronicam]]s, Gleason was later able to release the series in syndication, which increased its popularity over the years with new audiences. He also developed ''[[The Jackie Gleason Show]],'' which maintained high ratings from the mid-1950s through 1970. After originating in [[New York City]], filming moved to [[Miami]], Florida, in 1964 after Gleason took up permanent residence there.

Among his notable film roles were [[Minnesota Fats]] in the 1961 [[Academy Award]]-winning drama ''[[The Hustler (film)|The Hustler]]'' (co-starring with [[Paul Newman]]), and [[Buford&amp;nbsp;T. Justice]] in the ''[[Smokey and the Bandit]]'' series from 1977 into the early 1980s (co-starring  [[Burt Reynolds]]).

Throughout the 1950s and 1960s Gleason enjoyed a prominent secondary music career, producing a series of best-selling "[[Beautiful music|mood music]]" albums. His first album, ''Music for Lovers Only'', still holds the record for the longest stay on the Billboard Top Ten Charts (153 weeks), and his first 10 albums sold over a million copies each.&lt;ref name=billboard&gt;''[[Joel Whitburn]] Presents the Billboard Albums, 6th edition'', {{ISBN|0-89820-166-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To date his output spans some 20-plus singles, nearly 60 long-playing record albums, and over 40 CDs.

==Early life==
John Herbert Gleason was born in 1916 at 364 Chauncey Street in the Stuyvesant Heights, now [[Bedford-Stuyvesant]] section of Brooklyn.&lt;ref&gt;Staff.

Gleason remembered Clement and his father having a "beautiful handwriting". He used to watch his father work at the family's kitchen table, writing insurance policies in the evenings. On the night of December 14, 1925, Gleason's father disposed of any family photos in which he appeared; just after noon on December 15, he collected his hat, coat, and paycheck, and permanently left his family and job at the insurance company. Once it became evident that he was not coming back, Mae went to work as a subway attendant for the [[Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation]] (BMT).&lt;ref name=NewYorkMag/&gt;

After his father abandoned the family, young Gleason began hanging around with a local gang, hustling pool.&lt;ref name=NewYorkMag/&gt; He attended P.S. 73 Elementary School in Brooklyn; [[John Adams High School (Queens)|John Adams High School]] in Queens; and Bushwick High School in Brooklyn. Gleason became interested in performing after being part of a class play; he quit school before graduating and got a job that paid $4 per night as [[master of ceremonies]] at a theater. Other jobs he held at that time included working in a pool hall, as a stunt driver, and as a carnival barker.&lt;ref name=NewYorkMag/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hill/&gt; Gleason and his friends made the rounds of the local theaters; he put an act together with one of his friends, and the pair performed on amateur night at the Halsey Theater, where Gleason replaced his friend Sammy Birch as master of ceremonies. He performed the same duties twice a week at the Folly Theater.&lt;ref name=NewYorkMag/&gt;
 
Gleason was 19 when his mother died in 1935 of [[sepsis]] from a large neck [[carbuncle]] that young Jackie had tried to lance.&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt; He had nowhere to go, and thirty six cents to his name. The family of his first girlfriend, Julie Dennehy, offered to take him in; Gleason, however, was headstrong and insisted that he was going into the heart of the city.&lt;ref name=NewYorkMag/&gt; His friend Birch made room for him in the hotel room he shared with another comedian. Birch also told him of a week-long gig in [[Reading, Pennsylvania]], which would pay $19, more money than Gleason could imagine. The booking agent advanced his bus fare for the trip against his salary, granting Gleason his first job as a professional comedian. Following this he would always have regular work in small clubs.&lt;ref name=Funny&gt;{{cite news|title=Funny comic, terrible husband|author=Bacon, James|date=June 30, 1987|publisher=The Milwaukee Journal|accessdate=January 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
[[File:Publicity photo young gleason.jpg|thumb|left|Early publicity photo of Gleason]]
Gleason worked his way up to a job at New York's Club 18, where insulting its patrons was the order of the day. Gleason greeted noted skater [[Sonja Henie]] by handing her an ice cube and saying, "Okay, now do something."&lt;ref name=Sydney/&gt; It was here that [[Jack L. Warner]] first saw Gleason, signing him to a film contract for $250 a week.&lt;ref name=NewYorkMag/&gt;

By age 24, Gleason was appearing in movies: first for [[Warner Brothers]] (as Jackie C. Gleason) in such films as ''[[Navy Blues (1941 film)|Navy Blues]]'' (1941) with [[Ann Sheridan]] and [[Martha Raye]] and ''[[All Through the Night (film)|All Through the Night]]'' (1941) with [[Humphrey Bogart]], for [[Columbia Pictures]] for the [[B movie|B]] military comedy ''[[Tramp, Tramp, Tramp]]'' (1942) and finally for [[Twentieth Century-Fox]], where Gleason played [[Glenn Miller Orchestra]] bassist Ben Beck in ''[[Orchestra Wives]]'' (1942). He also had a small part as a [[soda shop]] clerk in ''[[Larceny, Inc.]]'' (1942), with [[Edward G. Robinson]], and a modest part as an actor's agent in the 1942 [[Betty Grable]]–[[Harry James]] musical ''[[Springtime in the Rockies]]''.

During [[World War II]], Gleason was initially exempt from military service, since he was a father of two. However, in 1943 the US started drafting men with children. Gleason reported to his induction where the doctors discovered that his broken left arm had healed crooked, the area between his thumb and forefinger was nerveless and numb, a [[pilonidal cyst]] existed at the end of his [[coccyx]], and that he was 100 pounds overweight. Gleason was therefore classified 4-F and rejected for military service.&lt;ref&gt;The Golden Ham: A Candid Biography of Jackie Gleason&lt;/ref&gt;

Gleason did not make a strong impression on Hollywood at first; at the time he developed a nightclub act that included comedy and music. At the end of 1942, Gleason and [[Lew Parker]] led a large cast of entertainers in the road show production of [[Olsen and Johnson]]'s ''New 1943 [[Hellzapoppin (musical)|Hellzapoppin]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=iLpRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=D2oDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1683,2316461&amp;dq=hellzapoppin+nixon&amp;hl=en]  {{dead link|date=August 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LAwEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;dq=%22Barto+and+Mann%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=eFOVqbST6K&amp;sig=j3ZOzN8J5HuOsZHTIbpSFt_LuRQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jgAgUPL3O6aUiAKnsIDICA&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Barto%20and%20Mann%22&amp;f=false |page=9 |title=Billboard - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date=1942-10-10 |accessdate=2015-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worthpoint.com/worthopedia/jackie-gleason-lew-parker-239226986 |title=Jackie Gleason Lew Parker HELLZAPOPPIN 1943 Hanna Theater Cleveland OHIO Program (01/14/2012) |publisher=Worthpoint.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also became known for hosting all-night parties in his hotel suite; the hotel soundproofed his suite out of consideration for its other guests.&lt;ref name=Sydney/&gt; "Anyone who knew Jackie Gleason in the 1940s", wrote [[CBS]] historian Robert Metz, "would tell you The Fat Man would never make it. His pals at Lindy's watched him spend money as fast as he soaked up the booze."{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

Gleason's first significant recognition as an entertainer came on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] when he appeared in the hit musical ''[[Follow the Girls]]'' (1944). While working in films in California, Gleason also worked at former boxer [[Maxie Rosenbloom]]'s nightclub (Slapsy Maxie's, on [[Wilshire Boulevard]]).&lt;ref name=NewYorkMag/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimemachines.com/new_page_43.htm |title=History of Los Angeles-Restaurants that are extinct |publisher=LA Time Machines |accessdate=February 3, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110210143922/http://www.latimemachines.com/new_page_43.htm |archivedate=February 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://images.cloud.worthpoint.com/wpimages/images/images1/1/0208/13/1_f3122d240b25e95021527a161d44f4a5.jpg|title=Photo-Slapsy Maxie's Nightclub|publisher=Worthpoint|accessdate=February 3, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180427235202/http://images.cloud.worthpoint.com/wpimages/images/images1/1/0208/13/1_f3122d240b25e95021527a161d44f4a5.jpg|archivedate=April 27, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gleason's big break occurred in 1949, when he landed the role of blunt but softhearted aircraft worker Chester A. Riley for the first television version of the radio comedy ''[[The Life of Riley]]''. ([[William Bendix]] originated the role on radio but was initially unable to accept the television role because of film commitments.) Despite positive reviews, the show received modest ratings and was cancelled after one year. Bendix reprised the role in 1953 for a five-year series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/eotvsection.php?entrycode=lifeofriley|title=The Life of Riley|publisher=Museum of Broadcast Communications|accessdate=February 3, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110211021032/http://www.museum.tv/eotvsection.php?entrycode=lifeofriley|archivedate=February 11, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Life of Riley'' became a television hit for Bendix during the mid- to late 1950s.&lt;ref name=Sydney/&gt; 
But long before this, Gleason's nightclub act had received attention from New York City's inner circle and the fledgling [[DuMont Television Network]]. He was working at Slapsy Maxie's when he was hired&lt;ref name=NewYorkMag/&gt; to host DuMont's ''[[Cavalcade of Stars]]'' variety hour in 1950, having been recommended by comedy writer [[Harry Crane]], whom he knew from his days as a stand up comedian in New York.&lt;ref name=UCLA&gt;[http://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/UCLA-Library-Acquires-Papers-of-5661 UCLA Newsroom: "UCLA Library Acquires Papers of Television Pioneer Harry Crane" by Teri Bond Michael] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150731034259/http://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/UCLA-Library-Acquires-Papers-of-5661 |date=July 31, 2015 }} November 18, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The program initially had rotating hosts; Gleason was first offered two weeks at $750 per week. When he responded it was not worth the train trip to New York, the offer was extended to four weeks. Gleason returned to New York for the show.&lt;ref name=NewYorkMag/&gt; He framed the acts with splashy dance numbers, developed sketch characters he would refine over the next decade, and became enough of a presence that CBS wooed him to its network in 1952.

Renamed ''[[The Jackie Gleason Show]]'', the program became the country's second-highest-rated television show during the 1954–55 season.&lt;ref name="Brooks, Tim and Marsh, Earle 2007"&gt;{{cite book|title=[[The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows, 1946-Present]]|author1=Brooks, Tim  |author2=Marsh, Earle|year=2007|publisher=[[Ballantine Books]]|isbn=978-0-345-49773-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gleason amplified the show with even splashier opening dance numbers, inspired by [[Busby Berkeley]] screen dance routines and featuring the precision-[[choreographed]] [[June Taylor Dancers]]. Following the dance performance, he would do an opening monologue. Then, accompanied by "a little travelin' music" ("[[That's a Plenty]]", a [[Dixieland]] classic from 1914), he would shuffle toward the wings, clapping his hands and shouting, "And awaaay we go!" The phrase became one of his trademarks, along with "How sweet it is!" (which he used in reaction to almost anything).&lt;ref name="Brooks, Tim and Marsh, Earle 2007"/&gt; Theona Bryant, a former [[John Robert Powers|Powers Girl]], became Gleason's "And awaaay we go" girl. [[Ray Bloch]] was Gleason's first music director, followed by [[Sammy Spear]], who stayed with Gleason through the 1960s; Gleason often kidded both men during his opening monologues. He continued developing comic characters, including

* ''Reginald Van Gleason III'', a top-hatted millionaire with a taste for both the good life and fantasy
* ''Rudy the Repairman,'' boisterous and boorish 
* ''Joe the Bartender'', gregarious and with friendly words for the never-seen Mr. Dennehy (always first at the bar)
* ''The Poor Soul'', a silent character who could (and often did) come to grief in the least-expected places (or demonstrated gratitude at such gifts as being allowed to share a newspaper on a subway)
* ''Rum Dum'', a character with a brush-like mustache who often stumbled around as though drunk and confused
* ''Fenwick Babbitt'', a friendly, addle-headed young man usually depicted working at various jobs and invariably failing
* ''Charlie Bratton'', a loudmouth who frequently picked on the mild-mannered Clem Finch (portrayed by [[Art Carney]], a future ''Honeymooners'' co-star)
* ''The Bachelor,'' a silent character (accompanied by the song "Somebody Loves Me") doing everyday things in an unusually lazy (or makeshift) way

In a 1985 interview, Gleason related some of his characters to his youth in Brooklyn. The Mr. Dennehy whom Joe the Bartender greets is a tribute to Gleason's first love, Julie Dennehy. The character of The Poor Soul was drawn from an assistant manager of an outdoor theater he frequented.&lt;ref name=NewYorkMag/&gt;

Gleason disliked rehearsing.

====''The Honeymooners''====
{{Main|The Honeymooners}}
[[File:Gleason meadows honeymooners 1955.jpg|thumb|Gleason as Ralph Kramden with [[Audrey Meadows]] as Alice, circa 1955|alt=Alice Kramden kissing Ralph after he gives her a bouquet]]
Gleason's most popular character by far was blustery bus driver [[Ralph Kramden]]. Largely drawn from Gleason's harsh Brooklyn childhood, these sketches became known as ''The Honeymooners.'' The show was based on Ralph's many get-rich-quick schemes, his ambition, antics with his best friend and neighbor, scatterbrained sewer worker Ed Norton, and clashes with sensible wife Alice, who typically pulled Ralph's head down from the clouds.

Gleason developed catchphrases he used on ''The Honeymooners,'' such as threats to Alice: "One of these days, Alice, pow, right in the kisser" or "Bang! Zoom! To the moon Alice, to the moon!"

''The Honeymooners'' originated from a sketch Gleason was developing with his show's writers. He said he had an idea he wanted to enlarge: a skit with a smart, quiet wife and her very vocal husband. He went on to describe that, while the couple had their fights, underneath it all they loved each other. Titles for the sketch were tossed around until someone came up with ''The Honeymooners''.&lt;ref name=NewYorkMag&gt;{{cite book|title=Gleason's Second Honeymoon|author=Hamill, Pete|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CLkBAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA42&amp;lpg=PA42&amp;dq=sammy+birch+gleason#v=onepage&amp;q=sammy%20birch%20gleason&amp;f=false|date=September 23, 1985|publisher=New York Magazine|accessdate=February 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Honeymooners'' first was featured on ''[[Cavalcade of Stars]]'' on October 5, 1951, with Carney in a guest appearance as a cop (Norton did not appear until a few episodes later) and character actress [[Pert Kelton]] as Alice. Darker and fiercer than the milder later version with [[Audrey Meadows]] as Alice, the sketches proved popular with critics and viewers. As Kramden, Gleason played a frustrated bus driver with a battleaxe of a wife in harrowingly realistic arguments; when Meadows (who was 15 years younger than Kelton) took over the role after Kelton was [[Hollywood blacklist|blacklisted]], the tone softened considerably.

When Gleason moved to CBS, Kelton was left behind; her name had been published in ''[[Red Channels]]'', a book that listed and described reputed communists (and communist sympathizers) in television and radio, and the network did not want to hire her. Gleason reluctantly let her leave the cast, with a cover story for the media that she had "heart trouble". At first he turned down Meadows as Kelton's replacement. Meadows wrote in her memoir that she slipped back to audition again and frumped herself up to convince Gleason that she could handle the role of a frustrated (but loving) working-class wife. Rounding out the cast, [[Joyce Randolph]] played Trixie, Ed Norton's wife. [[Elaine Stritch]] had played the role as a tall and attractive blonde in the first sketch, but was quickly replaced by Randolph. Comedy writer [[Leonard B. Stern|Leonard Stern]] always felt ''The Honeymooners'' was more than sketch material and persuaded Gleason to make it into a full hour-long episode.

In 1955 Gleason gambled on making it a [[The Honeymooners|separate series entirely]]. These are the "Classic 39" episodes, which finished 19th in the ratings for their only season.&lt;ref name="Brooks, Tim and Marsh, Earle 2007"/&gt; They were filmed with a new DuMont process, [[Electronicam]]; like [[kinescopes]], it preserved a live performance on film but with higher quality, comparable to a motion picture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dumonthistory.tv/a4.html|title=Electronicam|publisher=DuMont Television Network Historical Website|author=Ingraham, Clarke|accessdate=October 2, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101027130615/http://dumonthistory.tv/a4.html|archivedate=October 27, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; That turned out to be Gleason's most prescient move. A decade later, he aired the half-hour ''Honeymooners'' in syndicated reruns that began to build a loyal and growing audience, making the show a television [[Pop icon|icon]]. Its popularity was such that in 2000, a life-size statue of Jackie Gleason, in uniform as bus driver [[Ralph Kramden]], was installed outside the [[Port Authority Bus Terminal]] in New York City.
Gleason went back to the live format for 1956-7 and short and long versions, including hour-long musicals. These musical presentations were reprised ten years later, in color, with Sheila MacRae and Jane Keane, as Alice and Trixie.
Audrey Meadows re appeared for one black and white remake of the '50s sketch, "The Adoption", telecast January 8, 1966. Ten years later she rejoined Gleason and Carney, but without Joyce Randolph, and with Jane Kean, for several TV Specials. (One special from 1973 was shelved ).
The Jackie Gleason Show ended in June 1957. In 1959, Jackie discussed the possibility of bringing back the Honeymooners in new episodes. His dream was partially realized with a Kramden - Norton sketch on a CBS variety show in late 1960 and two more sketches on his new hour long CBS show, The American Scene Magazine, in 1962.

Throughout the 1950s and 1960s Gleason enjoyed a prominent secondary music career, producing a series of best-selling "[[Beautiful music|mood music]]" albums with [[jazz]] overtones for [[Capitol Records]]. Gleason believed there was a ready market for romantic instrumentals. His goal was to make "musical wallpaper that should never be intrusive, but conducive".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jackie Gleason Albums |url=http://music.aol.com/album/the-romantic-moods-of-jackie-gleason/191846 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120712164054/http://music.aol.com/album/the-romantic-moods-of-jackie-gleason/191846 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 12, 2012 |work=AoL Music |publisher=AOL Inc |accessdate=August 16, 2012 |author=AoL Music |year=2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He recalled seeing [[Clark Gable]] play love scenes in movies; the romance was, in his words, "magnified a thousand percent" by background music. Gleason reasoned, "If ''Gable'' needs music, a guy in Brooklyn must be ''desperate!''"&lt;ref name=NewYorkMag/&gt;

Gleason's first album, ''Music for Lovers Only'', still holds the record for the longest stay on the Billboard Top Ten Charts (153 weeks), and his first 10 albums sold over a million copies each.&lt;ref name=billboard/&gt; At one point, Gleason held the record for charting the most number-one albums on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] without charting any hits on the Top 40 of the ''[[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]'' singles chart.&lt;ref&gt;Gael Fashingbauer Cooper (June 15, 2014).

Gleason could not read or write music; he was said to have conceived melodies in his head and described them vocally to assistants who transcribed them into musical notes.&lt;ref name=NewYorkMag/&gt; These included the well-remembered themes of both ''The Jackie Gleason Show'' ("Melancholy Serenade") and ''The Honeymooners'' ("You're My Greatest Love").&lt;ref name=Hill&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Ry4tAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Fr0EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5473,8881587&amp;dq=june+taylor&amp;hl=en |title=Entertainer Jackie Gleason, the Great One, dies of cancer |author=Lester, Will |date=June 25, 1987 |publisher=The Rock Hill Herald |accessdate=January 20, 2011 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of period accounts establishing his direct involvement in musical production, varying opinions have appeared over the years as to how much credit Gleason should have received for the finished products. Biographer William A. Henry III wrote in his 1992 book, ''The Great One: The Life and Legend of Jackie Gleason'', that beyond the possible conceptualizing of many of the song melodies, Gleason had no direct involvement (such as conducting) in making the recordings. [[Red Nichols]], a jazz great who had fallen on hard times and led one of the group's recordings, was not paid as session-leader. Cornetist and trumpeter [[Bobby Hackett]] soloed on several of Gleason's albums and was leader for seven of them. Asked late in life by musician–journalist Harry Currie in Toronto what Gleason really did at the recording sessions, Hackett replied, "He brought the checks".

But years earlier Hackett had glowingly told writer James Bacon: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Jackie knows a lot more about music than people give him credit for. I have seen him conduct a 60-piece orchestra and detect one discordant note in the brass section. He would immediately stop the music and locate the wrong note. It always amazed the professional musicians how a guy who technically did not know one note from another could do that. And he was never wrong.&lt;ref&gt;Bacon, James. ''How Sweet It Is.'' {{ISBN|0-312-39621-X}}. p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The composer and arranger [[George Williams (musician)|George Williams]] has been cited in various biographies as having served as [[ghostwriter]] for the majority of arrangements heard on many of Gleason's albums of the 1950s and 1960s.&lt;ref name="great"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Great One: The Life and Legend of Jackie Gleason|author = Henry III, William A |authorlink=William A.

Nearly all of Gleason's albums have been re-issued on compact disc, with many of these having been made available in digital-format.

Gleason's lead role in the musical, ''[[Take Me Along]]'' (1959–60), won him a [[Tony Award]] for [[Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Musical|Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Musical]].

In addition to his salary and royalties, CBS paid for Gleason's [[Peekskill, New York]], mansion, "[[Round Rock Hill]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F4071FFF385C0C768EDDAF0894DF484D81|title=Jackie Gleason Dies Of Cancer; Comedian And Actor Was 71|author=Pace, Eric|date=June 15, 1987|accessdate=November 21, 2010|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Set on six acres, the architecturally noteworthy complex included a round main home, guest house, and storage building.

In October 1960, Gleason and Carney briefly returned, for a ''Honeymooners'' sketch, on a TV special. His next foray into television was the [[game show]] ''[[You're in the Picture]]'', which survived its disastrous premiere episode only because of Gleason's&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows, 1946-Present]]|author1=Brooks, Tim  |author2=Marsh, Earle|year=2007|publisher=[[Ballantine Books]] |isbn=978-0-345-49773-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; humorous on-the-air apology the following week.&lt;ref name=Hill/&gt; For the rest of its scheduled run, the program was a talk show named ''The Jackie Gleason Show''.

In 1962, Gleason resurrected his variety show with more splashiness and a new hook: a fictitious general-interest magazine called ''The American Scene Magazine'', through which Gleason trotted out his old characters in new scenarios; including two new Honeymooners sketches. He also added another catchphrase to the American vernacular, first uttered in the 1963 film ''[[Papa's Delicate Condition]]'': "How sweet it is!" ''The Jackie Gleason Show: The American Scene Magazine'' was a hit, and continued for four seasons. Each show began with Gleason delivering a monologue and commenting on the attention-getting outfits of band leader [[Sammy Spear]]. Then the "magazine" features would be trotted out, from Hollywood gossip (reported by comedian Barbara Heller) to news flashes (played for laughs with a stock company of second bananas, chorus girls and dwarfs). Comedian [[Alice Ghostley]] occasionally appeared as a downtrodden tenement resident, sitting on her front step and listening to boorish boyfriend Gleason for several minutes. After the boyfriend took his leave, the smitten Ghostley would exclaim, "I'm the luckiest girl in the world!" Veteran comics Johnny Morgan, Sid Fields, and Hank Ladd were occasionally seen opposite Gleason in comedy sketches. Helen Curtis played alongside him as a singer and actress, delighting audiences with her 'Madame Plumpadore' sketches with 'Reginald Van Gleason.'

The final sketch was always set in Joe the Bartender's saloon, with Joe singing "My Gal Sal" and greeting his regular customer, the unseen Mr. Dennehy (the TV audience, as Gleason spoke to the camera in this section). During the sketch, Joe would tell Dennehy about an article he had read in the fictitious "American Scene" magazine, holding a copy across the bar. It had two covers: one featured the New York skyline and the other palm trees (after the show moved to Florida). Joe would bring out [[Frank Fontaine]] as Crazy Guggenheim, who would regale Joe with the latest adventures of his neighborhood pals and sometimes show Joe his current ''[[Top Cat]]'' comic book. Joe usually asked Crazy to sing—almost always a sentimental ballad in his fine, lilting baritone.

Gleason revived ''The Honeymooners''—first with [[Sue Ane Langdon]] as Alice and Patricia Wilson as Trixie for two episodes of ''The American Scene Magazine'', then with [[Sheila MacRae]] as Alice and [[Jane Kean]] as Trixie for the 1966 series.&lt;ref name=Hill/&gt; By 1964 Gleason had moved the production from New York to [[Miami Beach, Florida]], reportedly because he liked year-round access to the golf course at the nearby Inverrary Country Club in [[Lauderhill, Florida|Lauderhill]] (where he built his final home). His closing line became, almost invariably, "As always, the Miami Beach audience is the greatest audience in the world!" In 1966, he abandoned the ''American Scene Magazine'' format and converted the show into a standard variety hour with guest performers.
[[File:Lucille Ball and Jackie Gleason 1975.JPG|thumb|right|Gleason and [[Lucille Ball]] in a TV special "Tea for Two" (1975) ]]
Gleason kicked off the 1966–1967 season with new, color episodes of ''The Honeymooners''. Carney returned as Ed Norton, with MacRae as Alice and Kean as Trixie. The sketches were remakes of the 1957 world-tour episodes, in which Kramden and Norton win a slogan contest and take their wives to international destinations. Each of the nine episodes was a full-scale musical comedy, with Gleason and company performing original songs by Lyn Duddy and Jerry Bresler. Occasionally Gleason would devote the show to musicals with a single theme, such as college comedy or political satire, with the stars abandoning their ''Honeymooners'' roles for different character roles. This was the show's format until its cancellation in 1970. (The exception was the 1968–1969 season, which had no hour-long ''Honeymooners'' episodes; that season, ''The Honeymooners'' was presented only in short sketches). The musicals pushed Gleason back into the top five in ratings, but audiences soon began to decline. By its final season, Gleason's show was no longer in the top 25. In the last original ''Honeymooners'' episode aired on [[CBS]] ("Operation Protest"), Ralph encounters the youth-protest movement of the late 1960s, a sign of changing times in both television and society.

Gleason (who had signed a deal in the 1950s that included a guaranteed $100,000 annual payment for 20 years, even if he never went on the air) wanted ''The Honeymooners'' to be just a portion of his format, but CBS wanted another season of only ''The Honeymooners''. The network had cancelled a mainstay variety show hosted by [[Red Skelton]] and would cancel ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' in 1971 because they had become too expensive to produce and attracted, in the executives' opinion, too old an audience. Gleason simply stopped doing the show in 1970 and left CBS when his contract expired.

===={{anchor|Revival of The Honeymooners}}''Honeymooners'' revival====
Gleason did two ''Jackie Gleason Show'' specials for CBS after giving up his regular show in the 1970s, including ''Honeymooners'' segments and a Reginald Van Gleason III sketch in which the gregarious millionaire was portrayed as an alcoholic. When the CBS deal expired, Gleason signed with [[NBC]]. He later did a series of ''Honeymooners'' specials for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. Gleason hosted four ABC specials during the mid-1970s. Gleason and Carney also made a television movie, ''[[Izzy and Moe]]'' (1985), about an unusual pair of historic Federal prohibition agents in New York City who achieved an unbeatable arrest record with highly successful techniques including impersonsations and humor, which aired on CBS in 1985.

In April 1974, Gleason revived several of his classic characters (including Ralph Kramden, Joe the Bartender and Reginald Van Gleason III) in a television special with [[Julie Andrews]]. In a song-and-dance routine, the two performed "Take Me Along" from Gleason's Broadway musical.

In 1985, three decades after the "Classic 39" began filming, Gleason revealed he had carefully preserved [[kinescopes]] of his live 1950s programs in a vault for future use (including ''Honeymooners'' sketches with [[Pert Kelton]] as Alice). These "lost episodes" (as they came to be called) were initially previewed at the [[The Paley Center for Media|Museum of Television and Radio]] in New York City, aired on the [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] cable network in 1985, and later added to the ''Honeymooners'' syndication package.
Some of them include earlier versions of plot lines later used in the 'classic 39' episodes. One (a Christmas episode duplicated several years later with Meadows as Alice) had all Gleason's best-known characters (Ralph Kramden, the Poor Soul, Rudy the Repairman, Reginald Van Gleason, Fenwick Babbitt and Joe the Bartender) featured in and out of the Kramden apartment. The storyline involved a wild Christmas party hosted by Reginald Van Gleason up the block from the Kramdens' building at Joe the Bartender's place.

Gleason did not restrict his acting to comedic roles. He had also earned acclaim for live television drama performances in "The Laugh Maker" (1953) on CBS's ''[[Studio One (US TV series)|Studio One]]'' and [[William Saroyan]]'s "[[The Time of Your Life (TV film)|The Time of Your Life]]" (1958), which was produced as an episode of the anthology series ''[[Playhouse 90]]''.

He was nominated for a [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] Academy Award for his portrayal of pool shark Minnesota Fats in ''The Hustler'' (1961), starring [[Paul Newman]]. Gleason made all his own trick pool shots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brown|first1=Wesley|title=Gleason showed real Hustler skills in Augusta|url=http://chronicle.augusta.com/life/life-style/2014-07-12/gleason-showed-real-hustler-skills-augusta|website=The Augusta Chronicle|publisher=The Augusta Chronicle|accessdate=20 December 2014|location=Augusta, Georgia, USA|date=12 July 2014|quote=Jackie Gleason needed no help to portray the real-life Minnesota Fats, the cutthroat pool shark he portrayed in the 1961 film who toyed with opponents before making decisive trick shots to collect from local hustlers.|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220052026/http://chronicle.augusta.com/life/life-style/2014-07-12/gleason-showed-real-hustler-skills-augusta|archivedate=December 20, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; (In his 1985 appearance on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'', Gleason told [[Johnny Carson]] that he had played [[Pool (cue sports)|pool]] frequently since childhood, and drew from those experiences in ''The Hustler''.) He was extremely well-received as a beleaguered [[boxing]] manager in the movie version of [[Rod Serling]]'s ''[[Requiem for a Heavyweight]]'' (1962). Gleason played a world-weary army sergeant in ''[[Soldier in the Rain]]'' (1963), in which he received top billing over [[Steve McQueen]].

Gleason wrote, produced and starred in ''[[Gigot (film)|Gigot]]'' (1962), in which he played a poor, mute janitor who befriended and rescued a [[prostitute]] and her small daughter. It was a box office flop. But the film's script was adapted and produced as the television film ''[[The Wool Cap]]'' (2004), starring [[William H. Macy]] in the role of the mute janitor; the television film received modestly good reviews.

Gleason played the lead in the [[Otto Preminger]]-directed ''[[Skidoo (film)|Skidoo]]'' (1968), considered an all-star failure. In 1969 [[William Friedkin]] wanted to cast Gleason as [[Jimmy "Popeye" Doyle|"Popeye" Doyle]] in ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]'' (1971), but because of the poor reception of ''Gigot'' and ''Skidoo,'' the studio refused to offer Gleason the lead; he wanted it. Instead, Gleason wound up in ''[[How to Commit Marriage]]'' (1969) with [[Bob Hope]], as well as the movie version of [[Woody Allen]]'s play ''[[Don't Drink the Water (1969 film)|Don't Drink the Water]]'' (1969). Both were unsuccessful.

Eight years passed before Gleason had another hit film. This role was the cantankerous and cursing Texas sheriff [[Buford T. Justice]] in the films ''[[Smokey and the Bandit]]'' (1977), ''[[Smokey and the Bandit II]]'' (1980) and ''[[Smokey and the Bandit Part 3]]'' (1983). He co-starred with [[Burt Reynolds]] as the Bandit, [[Sally Field]] as Carrie (the Bandit's love interest), and [[Jerry Reed]] as Cledus "Snowman" Snow, the Bandit's truck-driving partner. Former NFL linebacker [[Mike Henry (football)|Mike Henry]] played his dimwitted son, Junior Justice. Gleason's gruff and frustrated demeanor and lines such as "I'm gonna barbecue yo' ass in molasses!" made the first ''Bandit'' movie a hit.

Years later, when interviewed by [[Larry King]], Reynolds said he agreed to do the movie only if the studio hired Jackie Gleason to play the part of Sheriff Buford T. Justice (the name of a real Florida highway patrolman, who knew Reynolds' father). Reynolds said that director [[Hal Needham]] gave Gleason free rein to ad-lib a great deal of his dialog and make suggestions for the film; the scene at the "Choke and Puke" was Gleason's idea. Reynolds and Needham knew Gleason's comic talent would help make the film a success, and Gleason's characterization of Sheriff Justice strengthened the film's appeal to blue-collar audiences.

During the 1980s, Gleason earned positive reviews playing opposite [[Laurence Olivier]] in the HBO dramatic two-man special, ''[[Mr. Halpern and Mr. Johnson]]'' (1983). He also gave a memorable performance as wealthy businessman U.S. Bates in the comedy ''[[The Toy (1982 film)|The Toy]]'' (1982) opposite [[Richard Pryor]]. Although the movie was critically panned, Gleason and Pryor's performances were praised. His last film performance was opposite [[Tom Hanks]] in the [[Garry Marshall]]-directed ''[[Nothing in Common]]'' (1986), a success both critically and financially.

===Fear of flying===
For many years, Gleason would only travel by train; his [[fear of flying]] arose from an incident in his early movie career. Gleason would fly back and forth to Los Angeles for relatively minor movie work. After finishing one movie, the comedian boarded a plane for New York. When two of the plane's engines cut out in the middle of the flight, the pilot had to make an emergency landing in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]].&lt;ref name=Flying&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=BYApAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=smUFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3420,4342788&amp;dq=june+taylor&amp;hl=en|title=The Great Gleason|author=Bishop, Jim|date=December 31, 1976|publisher=Lewiston Evening Journal|accessdate=January 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although another plane was prepared for the passengers, Gleason had enough of flying. He went into downtown Tulsa, walked into a hardware store, and asked its owner to lend him $200 for the train trip to New York. The owner asked Gleason why he thought anyone would lend a stranger so much money. Gleason identified himself and explained his situation. The store owner said he would lend the money if the local theater had a photo of Gleason in his latest film. But the publicity shots showed only the principal stars. Gleason proposed to buy two tickets to the movie and take the store owner; he would be able to see the actor in action. The two men watched the movie for an hour before Gleason appeared on screen. The owner gave Gleason the loan, and he took the next train to New York. There he borrowed $200 to repay his benefactor.&lt;ref name=Flying/&gt;

Gleason was greatly interested in the [[paranormal]], buying and reading numerous books on the topic, as well as on [[parapsychology]] and [[UFO]]s.&lt;ref name=Back&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=V1RNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=qfoDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3638,6411758&amp;dq=june+taylor&amp;hl=en|title=Jackie Gleason: Why The Great One Is Great|author=Rosenblatt, Andy|date=May 21, 1978|publisher=Lakeland Ledger|accessdate=January 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="great"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bacon, James 1986"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Love, Alice: My Life as a Honeymooner |last1=Meadows |first1=Audrey |authorlink1=Audrey Meadows |last2=Daley |first2=Joe |publisher=[[Crown Publishing Group]] |year=1994 |chapter=Jackie the Hypnotist |isbn=0-517-59881-7 |url=http://www.audreymeadows.com/FunStuff/Jackiestory2.html |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121031234/http://www.audreymeadows.com/FunStuff/Jackiestory2.html |archivedate=November 21, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1950s he was a semi-regular guest on a paranormal-themed overnight radio show hosted by [[John Nebel]], and wrote the introduction to [[Donald Bain (writer)|Donald Bain]]'s biography of Nebel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bain, Donald|authorlink=Donald Bain (writer)|title=Long John Nebel: Radio Talk King, Master Salesman, and Magnificent Charlatan|location=New York|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers (United States)|Macmillan]]|isbn=0-02-505950-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his death, his large book collection was donated to the library of the [[University of Miami]].&lt;ref name="collection"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scholar.library.miami.edu/gleason|title=The Jackie Gleason Collection|publisher=[[University of Miami]]|accessdate=2015-08-17|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150828023516/http://scholar.library.miami.edu/gleason/|archivedate=August 28, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A complete listing of the holdings of Gleason's library has been issued by the online cataloging service [[LibraryThing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JackieGleason|url=http://www.librarything.com/profile/JackieGleason|work=Legacy Libraries|publisher=LibraryThing|accessdate=December 20, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131220105250/http://www.librarything.com/profile/JackieGleason|archivedate=December 20, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to writer Larry Holcombe, Gleason's known interest in UFOs allegedly prompted [[Richard Nixon|President Richard Nixon]] to share some information with him and to disclose some UFO data publicly.&lt;ref&gt;Larry Holcombe: ''The Presidents and UFOs: A Secret History from FDR to Obama.'' New York: Macmillan, March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marriages and family===
Gleason met dancer Genevieve Halford when they were working in [[vaudeville]], and they started to date. Halford wanted to marry but Gleason was not ready to settle down. She said she would see other men if they did not marry. One evening when Gleason went onstage at the Club Miami in [[Newark, New Jersey]], he saw Halford in the front row with a date. At the end of his show, Gleason went to the table and proposed to Halford in front of her date. They were married on September 20, 1936.&lt;ref name=Funny/&gt;&lt;ref name=Linda/&gt;&lt;ref name=Divorce&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=a8QmAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=biQEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1880,1794083&amp;dq=genevieve+halford&amp;hl=en|title=Jackie Gleason Asks Divorce In New York|date=October 24, 1968|publisher=The Times-News|accessdate=January 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1954, Gleason suffered a broken leg and ankle on-air during his television show.

Gleason met his second wife, Beverly McKittrick, at a country club in 1968, where she worked as a secretary. Ten days after his divorce from Halford was final, Gleason and McKittrick were married in a registry ceremony in [[Ashford, Surrey|Ashford, England]] on July 4, 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_QwdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=EZwEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3936,773820&amp;dq=beverly+mckittrick&amp;hl=en|title=Jackie Gleason Weds Secretary|author=Forbes, Donald|date=July 4, 1970|publisher=The Tuscaloosa News|accessdate=January 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974 Marilyn Taylor encountered Gleason again when she moved to the Miami area to be near her sister [[June Taylor|June]], whose dancers were part of Gleason's shows for many years. She had been out of show business for nearly 20 years. In September 1974 Gleason filed for divorce from McKittrick (who contested, asking for a reconciliation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZAcrAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=XZgFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6702,4040179&amp;dq=beverly+mckittrick&amp;hl=en|title=People in the News-Action Contested|date=September 18, 1974|publisher=Reading Eagle|accessdate=January 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The divorce was granted on November 19, 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ndVgAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Y24NAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3866,3452055&amp;dq=beverly+mckittrick&amp;hl=en|title=Gleasons Divorce|date=November 20, 1975|publisher=The Evening News|accessdate=January 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a widow with a young son, Marilyn Taylor married Gleason on December 16, 1975; the marriage lasted until his death in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=lFVRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=BjQNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5811,2979105&amp;dq=beverly+mckittrick&amp;hl=en|title=How Sweet She Is|date=December 17, 1975|publisher=The Evening News|accessdate=January 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Back/&gt;&lt;ref name="Obit"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=iwEkAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=KmcEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6167,5582544&amp;dq=jackie+gleason&amp;hl=en|title=Jackie Gleason To Marry For Third Time Tuesday|date=December 12, 1975|publisher=Sarasota Herald-Tribune|accessdate=November 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later years and death===
As early as 1952, when ''The Jackie Gleason Show'' captured Saturday night for CBS, Gleason regularly smoked six packs of cigarettes a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.com/archive/jackie-gleason/|title=Jackie Gleason|author=|date=|website=people.com|accessdate=April 27, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171206074629/http://people.com/archive/jackie-gleason/|archivedate=December 6, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Jackie Gleason Mausoleum.JPG|thumb|right|Gleason's sarcophagus&amp;mdash;with the inscription "And Away We Go"&amp;mdash;at Our Lady of Mercy Catholic Cemetery in Miami]]
In 1978, he suffered chest pains while touring in the lead role of [[Larry Gelbart]]'s play ''[[Sly Fox]]''; this  forced him to leave the show in [[Chicago]] and go to the hospital. He was treated and released, but after suffering another bout the following week, he returned and underwent triple-bypass surgery.&lt;ref name="surgery"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xQ4qAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=DdMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1452,1731651&amp;dq=jackie+gleason&amp;hl=en|title=Doctors Say Heart Attack Was Imminent Before Gleason Surgery|date=June 6, 1978|publisher=Daytona Beach Morning Journal|accessdate=April 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Gleason ails;Schnoz better |date=June 1, 1978 |publisher=The Miami News |accessdate=April 9, 2012 }}{{dead link|date=August 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=pMJBAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=B6oMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2859,4502692&amp;dq=jackie+gleason&amp;hl=en|title=Gleason in hospital again|date=May 30, 1978|publisher=The Telegraph-Herald|accessdate=April 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gleason delivered a critically acclaimed performance as an infirm, acerbic, and somewhat [[Archie Bunker]]–like character in the [[Tom Hanks]] comedy–drama ''[[Nothing in Common]]'' (1986). This was Gleason's final film role. During production, it was determined that he was suffering from terminal [[Colorectal cancer|colon cancer]], which had metastasized to his liver. Gleason was also suffering from phlebitis and diabetes. "I won't be around much longer", he told his daughter at dinner one evening after a day of filming. Gleason kept his medical problems private, although there were rumors that he was seriously ill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=JbwbAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=X04EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5207,6089028&amp;dq=genevieve+halford&amp;hl=en|title=Gleason hid nature of illness from fans|author=Wilson, Catherine|date=June 26, 1987|publisher=The Times-News|accessdate=January 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, on June 24, 1987, Gleason died at age 71 at his Florida home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gleason's death came quietly at age 71 |author=Konicki, Steve |date=June 25, 1987 |publisher=The Miami News |accessdate=November 19, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=August 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a funeral mass at the [[Cathedral of Saint Mary (Miami)|Cathedral of Saint Mary]], Gleason was entombed in a [[sarcophagus]] in a private outdoor [[mausoleum]] at Our Lady of Mercy Catholic Cemetery in Miami.&lt;ref name="Obit"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=RhAhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Y3IFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2532,6768410&amp;dq=jackie+gleason&amp;hl=en|title=Gleason's Widow Pins Last Carnation On 'Great One's' Lapel; Fans Gather|author=Dickerson, A.

* Miami Beach in 1987 renamed the [[Miami Beach Auditorium]] as the [[Fillmore Miami Beach at Jackie Gleason Theater|Jackie Gleason Theater of the Performing Arts]]. As of May 2010, the theater was scheduled to be razed as part of a convention-center remodeling project and replaced by a hotel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local-beat/Jackie-Gleason-Theater-Away-it-goes-92835289.html|title=Jackie Gleason Theater:Away It Goes!|date=May 5, 2010|publisher=NBC Miami|accessdate=October 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbpulse.com/music/2010/06/16/future-of-former-jackie-gleason-theater-uncertain/ |title=Future of Former Jackie Gleason Theater Uncertain |date=June 16, 2010 |publisher=Palm Beach Post |accessdate=October 1, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100623022552/http://www.pbpulse.com/music/2010/06/16/future-of-former-jackie-gleason-theater-uncertain/ |archivedate=June 23, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The demolition did not take place and The Fillmore Miami Beach is still in operation as of October 2017.
* Gleason was inducted in 1986 into the [[Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences]] [[Television Hall of Fame]]. In 2000 a statue of him as Ralph Kramden in "And away we go!" pose was installed at the Miami Beach Bus Terminal.
* Remarkably, while Gleason was nominated three times for an Emmy Award, he never won. (Carney and Keane did, however.)  When Gleason hosted the 1976 Emmy Awards, [[Paul Lynde]] received an Entertainer of the Year Emmy award for being voted the funniest man of the year, which Lynde immediately turned over to Gleason, citing him as "the funniest man ever."  This gesture was totally unexpected and shocked Gleason.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

* A statue of Gleason as Ralph Kramden in his bus driver's uniform was dedicated in August 2000 in New York City in [[Manhattan]] at the 40th Street entrance of the [[Port Authority Bus Terminal]] (PABT). The statue was shown briefly in the film ''[[World Trade Center (film)|World Trade Center]]'' (2006). 
* A city park in [[Lauderhill, Florida]] was named as "Jackie Gleason Park" in his honor; it is near his former home and features racquetball and basketball courts and a children's playground.
* Signs on the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] advising drivers they are entering Brooklyn have the Gleason phrase "How Sweet It Is!"
* Late in his life actor-playwright [[Jason Miller (playwright)|Jason Miller]], Gleason's former son-in-law, was writing a screenplay based on Gleason's life. He died before it was completed. Gleason's daughter, Linda Miller, was also an actress.&lt;ref name=Linda&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WcsMAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=DF4DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2731,721538&amp;dq=genevieve+halford&amp;hl=en|title=Actress seeks place beyond the shadow of her legendary father|author=Scott, Vernon|date=November 9, 1983|publisher=St. Petersburg Times|accessdate=January 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
