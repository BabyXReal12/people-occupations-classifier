==Early life==
Edward John Izzard&lt;ref name="sydmornher_1"/&gt; was born on 7 February 1962 in the [[Colony of Aden]],&lt;ref name="bono_intrvw"/&gt; the younger son of English parents Dorothy Ella and Harold John Michael Izzard. The family name is of French Huguenot origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/refugee-week-the-huguenots-count-among-the-most-successful-of-britains-immigrants-10330066.html|title=Huguenots among most successful of Britain's immigrants|website=The Independent|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother was a midwife and nurse, while his father was an accountant who was working in Aden with [[BP|British Petroleum]] at the time of Izzard's birth.&lt;ref name="nytimes_james"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tlgrph_farndale"/&gt; When Izzard was one year old, the family moved to Northern Ireland, settling in [[Bangor, County Down]] and living there until Izzard was five.&lt;ref name="indpndnt_sweeney"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sydmornher_1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bono_intrvw"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes_james"/&gt; The family then moved to Wales, where they lived in [[Skewen]], West Glamorgan.

Izzard's mother died of cancer when Izzard was six and his brother, Mark, was eight.&lt;ref name="sydmornher_1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tlgrph_farndale"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mirror_neil"/&gt; He and his brother built a [[Rail transport modelling|model railway]] to occupy their time while their mother was ill (it was donated to [[Bexhill Museum]] in 2016).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-sussex-36769982|title=Eddie Izzard opens museum exhibit of childhood model railway|publisher=BBC News|date=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following his mother's death, Izzard attended [[boarding school]]s&lt;ref name="sydmornher_1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tlgrph_farndale"/&gt; such as St John's School in [[Porthcawl]], Mid Glamorgan,&lt;ref name="latimes_brownfield"/&gt; as well as [[St Bede's School, Eastbourne|St Bede's Prep School]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ciaran Brown|url=http://www.ciaranbrown.com/izzard.html|title=Ciaran Brown meets actor and comedian Eddie Izzard|publisher=Ciaranbrown.com|date=26 September 2006 |accessdate=14 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Eastbourne College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/torchrelay |title=Olympic Torch Relay – Live Relay|publisher=BBC|accessdate=13 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that he knew he was a [[transgender]] person&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jennifer ruby |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/celebrity-news/eddie-izzard-gives-inspiring-speech-on-being-transgender-as-he-takes-a-break-from-marathon-to-get-a3204136.html |title=Eddie Izzard gives inspiring speech on being transgender as he takes a break from marathon to get his nails done &amp;#124; Celebrity News &amp;#124; Showbiz &amp;#124; London Evening Standard |publisher=Standard.co.uk |date=2016-03-15 |accessdate=2016-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the age of four, after watching another boy being forced to wear a dress by his sisters, and knew he wanted to be an actor at the age of seven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xh1JrJ7HYKk&amp;NR=1|title=Eddie Izzard on Q TV|publisher=YouTube|date=15 June 2010 |accessdate=13 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===Comedy===
[[File:EddieIzzard.jpg|thumb|Izzard in 2008]]
Izzard began to toy with comedy at the [[University of Sheffield]], with student friend Rob Ballard.&lt;ref name="thsndytmes_appleyard"/&gt;&lt;ref name="latimes_taylor"/&gt; After leaving his accountancy degree course, he and Ballard took their act to the streets,&lt;ref name="thsndytmes_appleyard"/&gt;&lt;ref name="latimes_taylor"/&gt; often in [[Covent Garden]].&lt;ref name="latimes_brownfield"/&gt;&lt;ref name="indpndnt_burrell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="thisislondon_dessau"/&gt; After his split with Ballard, Izzard spent a great deal of the early 1980s working as a street performer in Europe and the United States. Izzard says that he developed his comedic voice by talking to his audience while doing solo escape acts after splitting with Ballard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=One Plus One: Eddie Izzard|date=2015-02-06|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/programs/one-plus-one/2015-02-06/one-plus-one-eddie-izzard/6077128|others=Jane Hutcheon|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|language=en-AU|accessdate=2017-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then moved his act into the stand-up comedy venues of Britain. His first gig was at the Banana Cabaret in [[Balham]], London.&lt;ref name="sydmornher_1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="itunes_amstell"/&gt;

In 1987, he made his first stage appearance at [[The Comedy Store, London|the Comedy Store]] in London.&lt;ref name="indpndnt_sweeney"/&gt;  He refined his material throughout the 1980s, and in the early 1990s he finally began earning some measure of recognition through his improvisation, in part at his own club "Raging Bull" in [[Soho]].&lt;ref name="thisislondon_dessau"/&gt;

Izzard speaks [[French language|French]] and has performed stand-up shows in the language; from 2014 he began to perform in [[German language|German]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Arabic]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Où est le punchline?

===Theatrical, TV and film appearances===

[[File:Eddie Izzard 2013 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Izzard at the 2013 [[British Academy]] Awards]]

In 1994, Izzard made his West End drama debut as the lead in the world premiere of [[David Mamet]]'s ''[[The Cryptogram]]'' with [[Lindsay Duncan]], in the production at London's Comedy Theatre. The success of that role led to his second starring role in David Beaird's black comedy ''900 Oneonta''. In 1995, he portrayed the title character in [[Christopher Marlowe]]'s ''[[Edward II (play)|Edward II]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre--another-piece-of-the-puzzle-paul-taylor-on-david-mamets-the-cryptogram-with-lindsay-duncan-and-the-comedian-eddie-izzard-1410874.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Paul | last=Taylor | title=THEATRE / Another piece of the puzzle: Paul Taylor on David Mamet's The Cryptogram, with Lindsay Duncan and the comedian Eddie Izzard | date=1 July 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 Izzard appeared briefly on stage with the Monty Python team in ''The American Film Institute's Tribute to Monty Python'' (also referred to as ''[[Monty Python Live at Aspen]]''). He walked on stage with the five surviving Pythons and he was summarily escorted off by [[Eric Idle]] and [[Michael Palin]] as he attempted to participate in a discussion about how the group got together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishclassiccomedy.co.uk/monty-python-live-at-aspen-1998 |title=Monty Python – Live At Aspen – 1998 |publisher=British Classic Comedy |date= |accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has appeared in a number of episodes of BBC 1's [[Have I Got News For You]].

Izzard portrayed comedian [[Lenny Bruce]] in the 1999 production of Julian Barry's 1971 play ''Lenny''. In 2001, he replaced [[Clive Owen]] in [[Peter Nichols]]' 1967 play ''[[A Day in the Death of Joe Egg]]'' at the [[Comedy Theatre]]. Izzard and [[Victoria Hamilton]] then repeated their lead roles when the show was brought to Broadway in 2003, with the [[Roundabout Theatre Company]] production. The revival received four [[Tony Award]] nominations including Best Revival of a Play, Best Leading Actor and Actress for its stars Izzard and Hamilton in their Broadway debuts, and Best Direction for Laurence Boswell. In June 2010, Izzard replaced [[James Spader]] in the role of Jack Lawson in [[David Mamet]]'s play ''[[Race (play)|Race]]'' on Broadway.&lt;ref name="nytimes_brantley"/&gt;

Izzard has appeared in numerous films, starting with 1996's ''[[The Secret Agent (1996 film)|The Secret Agent]]''.

He said in 2009 that he would not be reprising his role as Reepicheep and the role was ultimately played by [[Simon Pegg]] in ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader]]''. He has stated he felt he learnt to act whilst working on the film [[Circus (2000 film)|Circus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.acast.com/distractionpieces/eddieizzard-distractionpiecespodcastwithscroobiuspip-168|title=Eddie Izzard - Distraction Pieces Podcast with Scroobius Pip #168 {{!}} Distraction Pieces Podcast with Scroobius Pip on acast|last=acast|date=2017-09-12|work=acast|access-date=2017-09-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Izzard appeared in the 2009 BBC science fiction miniseries ''[[The Day of the Triffids (2009 TV series)|The Day of the Triffids]]'' based on the [[The Day of the Triffids|1951 novel]], alongside [[Jason Priestley]], [[Vanessa Redgrave]], [[Joely Richardson]], [[Dougray Scott]] and [[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]].&lt;ref name="telegraph_1"/&gt;

Izzard presented the medals to the athletes who had won the 800m [[T54 (classification)|T54]] race at the London [[2012 Summer Olympics|2012 Paralympic Games]], including gold medalist [[David Weir (wheelchair athlete)|David Weir]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/general/others/the-independent-sports-quiz-of-the-year-8431245.html|title=The Independent sports quiz of the year|date=26 December 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comic style==
[[File:Elliott Gould and Eddie Lzzard.jpg|thumb|right|[[Elliott Gould]] and Eddie Izzard in 2006]]
Izzard uses a stream-of-consciousness delivery that jumps between topics. As he put it in a 2004 interview with ''[[The Guardian]]'', "It's the oral tradition. Human beings have been doing it for thousands of years".&lt;ref name="guardian_bedell"/&gt; His bent towards the surreal even went so far as to produce a sitcom called ''[[Cows (TV series)|Cows]]'' in 1997 for [[Channel 4]], a live action comedy with actors dressed in cowsuits.&lt;ref name="auntimomo_1"/&gt;

==Political views and activism==
Izzard has engaged in campaigning work. He is especially well known as a pro-[[European Union]] campaigner, supporting the further integration of the UK into the EU. In May 2005, he appeared on the BBC's political debate show ''[[Question Time (TV series)|Question Time]]'', describing himself as a "British-European", comparing this with other cultural identities such as "[[African-American]]". As part of his integration campaigning, he was one of the first people to spend a Euro in London. This pan-European approach has influenced his work; he regularly performs in [[French language|French]]&lt;ref name="indpndnt_burrell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hitfix_fienberg"/&gt; and occasionally in [[German language|German]].&lt;ref name="thisislondon_dessau"/&gt; On 16 June 2017, on the "Overtime" segment of [[HBO]] political [[talk show]] ''[[Real Time with Bill Maher]]'', Izzard claimed to be working in four languages: Spanish, German, French and English.

In July 2003, Izzard received an honorary [[Doctorate of Letters]] from the [[University of East Anglia|University of East Anglia, Norwich]], for "pro-Europe campaigning", "his contribution to promoting modern languages and tolerance of other cultures and lifestyles", and for having "transcended national barriers" with his humour.&lt;ref name="eastanglia_2007"/&gt; He has also campaigned unsuccessfully against the closure of the departments of Drama and Languages, Linguistics and Translation at the [[University of East Anglia]], although the department of Drama was later reprieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2004/may/18/highereducation.uk|title=Eddie Izzard leads charge against course closures|last=Curtis|first=Polly|date=18 May 2004|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=12 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, Izzard was named in a list of the biggest private financial donors to the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]].&lt;ref name="bbc_19980830"/&gt; He appeared in a party political broadcast for the Labour Party in the run-up to the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 general election]]. He donated nearly £10,000 to the party in 2008,&lt;ref name="politics_1"/&gt; appeared again in a party political broadcast for the [[European Parliament election, 2009 (United Kingdom)|2009 European election]], and again in a 2010 election video entitled ''Brilliant Britain''. Izzard appeared in literature to support changing the British electoral system from [[first-past-the-post]] to [[Instant-runoff voting|alternative vote]] for electing Members of Parliament to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] in the [[United Kingdom Alternative Vote referendum, 2011|Alternative Vote referendum]] in 2011.&lt;ref name="bbc_1"/&gt; In 2011, Izzard revealed that he had political ambitions and wanted to become an MP, Mayor, or MEP by 2020.&lt;ref name="green_room_provenza"/&gt; On 25 February 2016, Izzard announced his intention to stand for the [[National Executive Committee]] of the Labour Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/eddie-izzard-am-standing-labour-7436733|title=Eddie Izzard on why he’s standing for Labour’s National Executive Committee|first=Eddie|last=Izzard|date=25 February 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was announced on 9 August 2016 that Izzard had failed to be elected to the NEC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2016/08/eddie-izzards-political-ambitions-hit-stumbling-blocks/|title=Eddie Izzard's kiss of death catches up with him {{!}} Coffee House|date=2016-08-08|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 July 2006, he received an honorary doctorate in Letters from the Faculty of Arts at the [[University of Sheffield]],&lt;ref name="shef_honrdoct"/&gt; where he spent one year on an Accounting and Financial Management course in the early 1980s. During his time at the university he established the now-defunct Alternative Productions Society in the Union of Students with the aim of promoting fringe-based arts. On 4 March 2010, he was elected as the Honorary President of the University of Sheffield [[University of Sheffield Union of Students|Students' Union]].&lt;ref name="shef_elec2010"/&gt;

On 7 July 2007, Izzard was one of the presenters from the [[Live Earth concert, London|London leg]] of [[Live Earth]]. During an interview for the 2008 ''Stripped'' tour, he spoke about becoming more active in European politics as well as running for political office in Europe within the next decade. Izzard added a stop in [[New Orleans]] during his 2008 ''Stripped'' tour. All proceeds from the performance of 23 June 2008 were donated to Neighbourhood Housing Services of New Orleans.&lt;ref name="nola_20080610"/&gt;

In March 2014, Izzard began leading a campaign encouraging Scots not to vote for independence in the [[Scottish independence referendum, 2014|September referendum]], saying that England would feel a "deep sense of loss" if Scotland were to leave the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/eddie-izzard-campaigns-against-scottish-independence-the-uk-would-feel-a-deep-sense-of-loss-if-scotland-left-9199722.html|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|first=Jenn|last=Selby|title=Eddie Izzard campaigns against Scottish Independence|date=18 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Izzard is an outspoken supporter of the Labour Party. In September 2011, he declared his ambition to stand for the party in the future as an [[Member of Parliament|MP]], [[Member of European Parliament|MEP]], or [[Mayor of London]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-15088430 Eddie Izzard: 'I will run for mayor, MEP or MP in 2020'].

Izzard confirmed his support for Labour in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|2015 general election]], attending a party rally with fellow comedian [[Ben Elton]] and actress [[Sally Lindsay]] in April 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Elton |first=Ben |author-link=Ben Elton |title=Comedian Ben Elton hits out at Myleene Klass over her mansion tax claims |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/apr/04/comedian-ben-elton-hits-out-at-myleene-klass-over-her-mansion-tax-claims |date=4 April 2015 |access-date=23 April 2015 |newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 July 2009, with only 5 weeks' training and no significant prior running experience, Izzard began seven weeks of back-to-back [[marathon]] runs (with Sundays off) across the UK to raise money for Sport Relief. He ran from [[London]] to [[Cardiff]] to [[Belfast]] to [[Edinburgh]] and back to London, carrying the flag of the country — England, Scotland, or Wales — in which he was running. In [[Northern Ireland]] he carried a self-designed green flag bearing a white dove. The blog ''Eddie Iz Running'' documented his 43 marathons in 51 days, covering at least 27 miles per day (totaling more than 1,100 miles), ending on 15 September 2009.&lt;ref name="comicrelief_1"/&gt;  He received a special award at [[BBC Sports Personality of the Year]] in 2009 for his achievements.&lt;ref name="bbc_20081213"/&gt; In March 2010, Izzard took part in the Sport Relief Mile event.&lt;ref name="telegraph_nikkhah"/&gt;

On 16 February 2016 the BBC announced that Izzard would attempt to run 27 marathons in 27 days, through [[South Africa]] for Sport Relief.&lt;ref&gt;Gay, Jason [https://www.wsj.com/articles/eddie-izzard-runs-and-runs-and-runs-1458169593 Eddie Izzard Runs.

March 18, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The significance of the number 27 came from the number of years spent in prison by [[Nelson Mandela]]. In total Izzard would aim to run more than 700 miles, in temperatures of up to 40&amp;nbsp;°C. Izzard completed his first marathon on 23 February. He attempted such a project in South Africa in 2012, but withdrew with health concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-35639243 |title=Eddie Izzard completes first of 27 marathons for Sport Relief |publisher=BBC News |date=15 February 2016 |accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He completed the marathon challenge on 20 March, at the statue of Mandela in front of the [[Union Buildings]] in [[Pretoria]]. Because he had spent one day in hospital, he had to run two consecutive marathons on this last day. He raised more than £1.35M for Sport Relief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-35856814|title=Izzard completes marathons challenge|date=20 March 2016|publisher=|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; A BBC documentary, detailing his feat, was broadcast on 28 March.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b075wbf0 |title=Eddie Izzard: Marathon Man for Sport Relief |publisher=BBC |date=28 March 2016 |accessdate=28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2017, Izzard declared his intention to become a Labour politician after endorsing Labour Party leader [[Jeremy Corbyn]] in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2017|2017 UK general election]]. He said: "I like Jeremy Corbyn. He believes in what he says."&lt;ref name="independent"&gt;{{cite news |last=Bishop|first=Christiana|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/eddie-izzard-comedian-labour-party-politician-jeremy-corbyn-london-mayor-mp-a7747046.html|title=Eddie Izzard declares ambition to become Labour Party politician after supporting Jeremy Corbyn|newspaper=The Independent |date=20 May 2017|accessdate=11 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October, he announced a renewed bid for election to Labour's National Executive Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mason|first=Rowena|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/oct/23/eddie-izzard-champions-diversity-in-bid-to-join-labour-nec|title=Eddie Izzard champions diversity in bid to join Labour NEC|newspaper=The Guardian|date=23 October 2017|accessdate=3 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2018, it was announced that Izzard had failed in his second bid to be elected to the NEC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Elgot |first=Jessica |date=16 January 2018 |title=Eddie Izzard says Labour infighting must end after NEC defeat |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/16/eddie-izzard-says-labour-infighting-must-end-after-nec-defeat |newspaper=The Guardian |access-date=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 March 2018, [[Christine Shawcroft]] resigned from the Labour Party's NEC. Izzard automatically replaced her and will serve until the next NEC election, to be held in summer 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-43605840|title=Anti-Semitism row official quits Labour NEC|date=31 March 2018|publisher=|accessdate=31 March 2018|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
During his 2008 ''Stripped'' tour, Izzard said he realised he was an [[atheist]]. He said, "I was warming the material up in New York, where one night, literally on stage, I realised I didn't believe in God at all. I just didn't think there was anyone upstairs."&lt;ref name="Hollywood Commons"/&gt; He has since described himself as a spiritual atheist, saying, "I don't believe in the guy upstairs, I believe in us."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=The Late Show with Stephen Colbert|title=Eddie Izzard Believes Comedy Is 'Human And Not National'|date=2017-06-14|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON0rtQyNS20|accessdate=2017-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Izzard keeps his romantic life private, citing the wishes of his companions not wanting to become content for his show.&lt;ref name="Hollywood Commons"/&gt; He dated [[Sarah Townsend]], who later directed the documentary ''Believe: The Eddie Izzard Story'',&lt;ref name="indpndnt_burrell"/&gt; and whom he first met while she was running a [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe|Fringe venue at the Edinburgh Festival]] in 1989.&lt;ref name="newsscotsman_hoggard"/&gt;

Izzard supports [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace FC]] and became an associate director at the club on 16 July 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cpfc.co.uk/news/2012/july/izzard-becomes-associate-director/|title=Izzard Becomes Associate Director|author=CrystalPalaceFC_user|publisher=|accessdate=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Izzard started to freely talk about his [[transvestism]] in venues like the Edinburgh Festival as early as 1992.&lt;ref name="guardian_05_2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="independent_lister"/&gt; His stance is that cross-dressing is neither part of his performance nor a sexual fetish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Visco|first=Gerry|title=Eddie Izzard, Force of Nature|url=http://www.interviewmagazine.com/culture/eddie-izzard|work=Interview Magazine|accessdate=22 May 2014|date=May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He remarks in his show ''[[Unrepeatable]]'' that "women wear what they want and so do I". According to Izzard, "Most transvestites fancy women."&lt;ref name="dresstokill"/&gt; He calls himself "a [[heterosexual|straight]] transvestite, or male lesbian".&lt;ref name="tough"/&gt; He has also said he is "a lesbian trapped in a man's body",&lt;ref name="bbc_20040517"/&gt; [[transgender]],&lt;ref name="guardian_05_2001"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people= |date=March 14, 2016 |title=Eddie on coming out as transgender - Eddie Izzard: Marathon Man - BBC Three |medium=[[YouTube]] video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARKUJIoeZpw |access-date=August 9, 2018 |publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "a complete boy plus half girl".&lt;ref name="tough"/&gt; He has expressed a belief that being transgender is caused by genetics and that someday this will be scientifically proven, having gone so far as to have his own [[genome]] sequenced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=London Real|title=DEALING WITH TRANSGENDER REACTIONS - Eddie Izzard on London Real|date=2015-12-14|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpPPaMazpf0|accessdate=2017-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception ==
On 18 March 2007, Izzard was listed as number 3 of the 100 Greatest British National Comedians (behind [[Peter Kay]] at number 2 and [[Billy Connolly]] at number 1) as part of British television station Channel 4's ongoing ''100 Greatest...'', series. In the 2010 updated version of the list he was ranked 5th.&lt;ref name="channel4_1"/&gt;

In 2012, he received an honorary doctorate from the [[University of Sunderland]].&lt;ref&gt;Nicola Weatherall, [https://archive.is/20140517015856/http://www.journallive.co.uk/north-east-news/todays-news/2012/07/05/sunderland-university-to-honour-eddie-izzard-charlie-spedding-and-alastair-stewart-61634-31327039 "Sunderland University to honour Eddie Izzard, Charlie Spedding and Alastair Stewart"], journallive.co.uk, 5 July 2012; accessed 16 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
