The first time Silverman performed stand-up comedy was in Boston at age 17. She described her performance as "awful".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marksfriggin.com/news01/6-11-01.htm#fri|title=MarksFriggin.com – Stern Show News – Archive|accessdate=July 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating from [[The Derryfield School]] in Manchester (Class of 1989), she attended [[New York University]] for a year but did not graduate.

==Career==

===1992–2007: Career beginnings and ''Jesus Is Magic''===
After beginning her stand-up comedy in 1992, Silverman was part of the [[Saturday Night Live (season 19)|1993–94 season]] of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (''SNL'') for 18 weeks as a writer and featured player. She was fired after one season where only one of the sketches she wrote survived to [[Rehearsal|dress rehearsal]] and none aired, although she did appear on the show as a cast member in skits, usually in smaller supporting roles. [[Bob Odenkirk]], a former ''SNL'' writer, explained, "I could see how it wouldn't work at ''SNL'' because she's got her own voice, she's very much Sarah Silverman all the time. She can play a character but she doesn't disappear into the character—she makes the character her."&lt;ref name="newyorker"/&gt; She has stated that she was not ready for SNL when she got the job.&lt;ref name="freshair"/&gt; She said that when she was fired it hurt her confidence for a year, but after that nothing could hurt her and that she attributes her time to SNL as being a key reason why she has been so tough in her career.&lt;ref name="freshair"/&gt; Later, she was grateful that her ''SNL'' time was short because it didn't end up defining her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Silverman|first=Sarah|title=The Bedwetter: Stories of Courage, Redemption, and Pee|year=2010|publisher=HarperCollins|location=New York|page=177}}&lt;/ref&gt; She parodied the situation when she appeared on ''[[The Larry Sanders Show]]'' episode "The New Writer" (1996), playing Sanders' new staff writer, whose jokes are not used because of the chauvinism and bias of the male chief comedy writer, who favors the jokes of his male co-writers. She appeared in three episodes of ''Larry Sanders'' during its final two seasons.

She also starred in the [[HBO]] [[sketch comedy]] series ''[[Mr. Show with Bob and David|Mr. Show]]'' (1995–1997) and had the leading role for the 1997 [[independent film]] ''[[Who's the Caboose?]]'', about a pair of New York comedians (Silverman and director [[Sam Seder]]) going to Los Angeles during pilot season to try to get a part in a television series; the film features numerous young comedians in supporting roles but never received a widespread theatrical release. Silverman and Seder later made a six-episode television series sequel entitled ''[[Pilot Season (TV series)|Pilot Season]]'' in which Silverman stars as the same character and Seder again directed. She made her network standup comedy debut on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' on July 3, 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Late Show with David Letterman (a Guest Stars &amp; Air Dates Guide)|url=http://epguides.com/LateShowwithDavidLetterman/|website=''epguides.com''|accessdate=August 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxHL49CcBXQ|title=YouTube|accessdate=July 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Silverman made several TV program guest appearances, including on ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'' in the two-part time travel episode "[[Future's End]]" (1996); ''[[Seinfeld]]'' in the episode "[[The Money]]" (1997); ''[[V.I.P. (TV series)|VIP]]'' in the episode "48{{frac|1|2}} Hours" (2002); ''[[Greg the Bunny]]'' as a series regular (2002); and on the puppet television comedy ''[[Crank Yankers]]'' as the voice of Hadassah Guberman (2003, 2007). She had small parts in the films ''[[There's Something About Mary]]'', ''[[Say It Isn't So (film)|Say It Isn't So]]'', ''[[School of Rock]]'', ''[[The Way of the Gun]]'', ''[[Overnight Delivery]]'', ''[[Screwed (2000 film)|Screwed]]'', ''[[Heartbreakers (2001 film)|Heartbreakers]]'', ''[[Evolution (2001 film)|Evolution]]'', ''[[School for Scoundrels (2006 film)|School for Scoundrels]],'' and ''[[Rent (film)|Rent]],'' playing a mixture of comic and serious roles.

In 2005, Silverman released a [[concert film]], ''[[Sarah Silverman: Jesus Is Magic]]'', based on her one-woman show of the same name. [[Liam Lynch (musician)|Liam Lynch]] directed the film, which was distributed by [[Roadside Attractions]]. It received 64% positive ratings based on 84 reviews on the [[Film criticism|film critics]] aggregator Web site [[Rotten Tomatoes]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/sarah_silverman_jesus_is_magic/ | title=Sarah Silverman: Jesus is Magic (2005) | work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | accessdate=February 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and earned approximately $1.3&amp;nbsp;million at the box office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=jesusismagic.htm | title=Sarah Silverman: Jesus is Magic | work=Box Office Mojo | accessdate=February 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the film's publicity campaign, she appeared online in ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' as the cover subject of ''[[Heeb]]'' magazine and in [[Roast (comedy)|roasts]] on Comedy Central of [[Pamela Anderson]] and [[Hugh Hefner]].

Silverman played a therapist in a skit for a bonus DVD of the album ''[[Lullabies to Paralyze]]'' by the band [[Queens of the Stone Age]]. Silverman also appears at the end of the video for American glam metal band [[Steel Panther]]'s "Death To All But Metal." On ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'', Silverman parodied sketches from ''[[Chappelle's Show]]'', replaying [[Dave Chappelle]]'s characterizations of [[Rick James]] and "Tyrone" as well as a [[Donnell Rawlings]] character based on the miniseries ''[[Roots (1977 miniseries)|Roots]]''. In 2006, Silverman placed 50th on ''[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]]'' Hot 100 List.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maximonline.com/slideshows/index.aspx?imgCollectId=94&amp;slideId=1955 |title=Maxim 2006 Hot 100 |work=[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]] |accessdate=February 25, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080102084323/http://www.maximonline.com/slideshows/index.aspx?imgCollectId=94&amp;slideId=1955 |archivedate=January 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, she placed 29th and appeared on the cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.maximonline.com/slideshows/index.aspx?slideId=3575&amp;imgCollectId=190 | title= Maxim 2007 Hot 100 | work=[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]] | accessdate=February 25, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070517045104/http://www.maximonline.com/slideshows/index.aspx?slideId=3575&amp;imgCollectId=190|archivedate=May 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sarah Silverman.jpg|thumb|Silverman at the [[Tribeca Film Festival]] in 2007]]
Her television sitcom ''[[The Sarah Silverman Program]]'' debuted on Comedy Central in February 2007, the series had 1.81&amp;nbsp;million viewers&lt;ref name="mediaweek" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/CA6414787.html?title=Article&amp;spacedesc=news| title= ''Silverman'' Scores on Comedy | first=Rebecca | last=Stropoli | work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]] | date=February 8, 2007 | accessdate=February 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and portrays the day-to-day adventures of fictionalized versions of Silverman, her sister [[Laura Silverman|Laura]], and their friends. A number of comedic actors from ''Mr. Show'' have appeared on ''The Sarah Silverman Program''. Silverman was nominated for a [[61st Primetime Emmy Awards|Primetime Emmy Award]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/sarah-silverman|title=Sarah Silverman – Television Academy|accessdate=July 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; for her acting on the show. At the awards ceremony, she wore a fake mustache. Comedy Central canceled ''The Sarah Silverman Program'' after three seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Sarah Silverman Program: TV Show Cancelled; No Season Four |url=http://tvseriesfinale.com/tv-show/sarah-silverman-program-canceled-14887/ |publisher=TV Series Finale |date=May 12, 2010 |accessdate=October 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2007, she hosted the [[MTV Movie Awards]]. During her opening act, she commented on the upcoming jail sentence of [[Paris Hilton]], who was in the audience, saying: "In a couple of days, Paris Hilton is going to jail. As a matter of fact, I heard that to make her feel more comfortable in prison, the guards are going to paint the bars to look like [[human penis|penises]]. I think it is wrong, too. I just worry she is going to break her teeth on those things."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mtv.com/ontv/movieawards/ma07/videos.jhtml| title=2007 MTV Movie Awards | publisher=MTV | format=Video | accessdate=February 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2007, she appeared at the ''[[MTV Video Music Award]]s''. Following the [[2007 MTV Video Music Awards#Britney Spears performance|comeback performance]] of [[Britney Spears]], Silverman mocked her on stage, saying: "Wow, she is amazing. I mean, she is 25 years old, and she has already accomplished everything she's going to accomplish in her life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mtv.com/ontv/vma/2007/videos.jhtml |title=2007 VMA |publisher=MTV |format=Video |accessdate=February 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2008, she appeared on ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'' to show [[Jimmy Kimmel]], her boyfriend at the time, a special video. The video turned out to be a song called "[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!#"I'm Fucking Matt Damon" video|I'm Fucking Matt Damon]]" in which she and [[Matt Damon]] sang a duet about having an affair behind Kimmel's back.

She returned in the sixth-season premiere and for the [[Monk (season 7)#ep7|100th episode of ''Monk'']]. According to the audio commentary on the ''[[Clerks II]]'' DVD, director [[Kevin Smith]] offered her the role that eventually went to [[Rosario Dawson]], but she turned it down out of fear of being typecast in "girlfriend roles". However, she told Smith the script was "really funny" and mentioned that if the role of [[List of View Askewniverse characters#Randal Graves|Randal Graves]] was being offered to her she "would do it in a heartbeat." She appeared in ''Strange Powers'', the 2009 documentary by Kerthy Fix and [[Gail O'Hara]] about cult songwriter Stephin Merritt and his band [[The Magnetic Fields]]. Silverman wrote a comic memoir, ''[[The Bedwetter|The Bedwetter: Stories of Courage, Redemption, and Pee]]'', which was published in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/04/books/04book.html|title=Starting Early, Swearing Often: A Smart Aleck's Story|first=Dave|last=Itzkoff|work=The New York Times|date=May 3, 2010|accessdate=30 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 20, 2012, Silverman made a [[public service announcement]] (PSA) criticizing new voter identification laws that create obstacles to the ability of certain groups to vote in the November presidential election, i.e., young, old, poor, and minority citizens. The project was financed by the [[Jewish Council for Education &amp; Research]] (JCER) and was co-produced by Mik Moore&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mik Moore: Co-creator of Sarah's PSAs|url=http://sarahsilvermanonline.com/2012/09/22/mik-moore-co-creator-of-sarahs-psas|accessdate=September 22, 2012|date=September 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ari Wallach]] (the pair that also co-produced The Great Schlep and Scissor Sheldon).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dermody|first=Katrine|title=Let My People Vote: Sarah Silverman demystifies voter ID laws (Q&amp;A video)|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/americas/united-states/120927/let-my-people-vote-sarah-silverman-voter-id-video|work=The Global Post|accessdate=May 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was released on May 30, 2014.

In 2013, [[HBO]] announced that Silverman would star with [[Patti LuPone]] and [[Topher Grace]] in a situation comedy pilot called ''People in New Jersey'', produced by ''SNL''{{'}}s [[Lorne Michaels]].&lt;ref name="Sarah Silverman, Topher Grace, Patti LuPone to star in HBO's Lorne Michaels pilot"&gt;{{cite news|last=Goldberg|first=Lesley|title=Sarah Silverman, Topher Grace, Patti LuPone to star in HBO's Lorne Michaels pilot|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/sarah-silverman-topher-grace-patti-643435|accessdate=October 9, 2013|newspaper=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=October 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pilot was not picked up for a series order.

In 2017, Silverman became the host of a new talk show on [[Hulu]] called ''[[I Love You, America]]''.

==Controversies==

===Media Action Network for Asian Americans incident===
[[File:Sarah Silverman (7588066284).jpg|left|thumb|Silverman at the 2013 San Diego Comic-Con International]]
In a July 2001 interview on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'', Silverman used the ethnic slur "[[chink]]" in explaining that a friend advised her to avoid jury duty by writing a racial slur on the selection form, "something inappropriate, like 'I hate chinks.'" Silverman said she decided that she did not want to be thought of as a racist, so "I wrote 'I love chinks'&amp;nbsp;– and who doesn't?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/41903/pc-police-bust-conan-o-brien-show|title=PC Police Bust Conan O'Brien Show|first=Josh|last=Grossberg|publisher=E!|date=July 18, 2001|accessdate=30 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Silverman said the joke satirizes the racist thought process. [[Guy Aoki]] of the Media Action Network for Asian Americans (MANAA) objected to her use of the slur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manaa.org|title=Manaa: Media Action Network for Asian Americans|publisher=Manaa.orgsked|accessdate=October 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Grossberg|first=Josh|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/article/index.jsp?uuid=56d9b005-f1ee-4150-b3ba-4740a0a7a663|title=PC Police Bust Conan O'Brien Show|publisher=E!|date=July 18, 2001|accessdate=February 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; NBC and O'Brien apologized, but Silverman did not. Later, appearing on ''[[Politically Incorrect]]'' in July and August 2001, Silverman questioned Aoki's sincerity, accusing him of exploiting the opportunity for publicity. On a later episode, Aoki appeared with Silverman and stated he did not accept Silverman's explanation, saying that it was not successful satire and that comedians should consult groups such as his before performing such material. She stated in an [[&lt;!-- National Public Radio| --&gt;NPR]] ''[[Fresh Air]]'' interview that she was asked to repeat the joke on ''Politically Incorrect'', among other places, but eventually dropped it from her act because she felt it was becoming stale.&lt;ref name="freshair"&gt;{{cite news|first=Terry|last=Gross|authorlink=Terry Gross|title=Sarah Silverman: 'Jesus Is Magic'|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4994761|work=[[Fresh Air]]|date= November 9, 2005|accessdate=June 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Silverman has since turned the complaint into grist for her standup act, saying that the experience helped teach her the important lesson that racism is bad: "And I mean ''bad'', like in that black way."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=David|last=Thorpe|url=http://www.forward.com/articles/9067|title=Is America Ready for Sarah Silverman?|work=The Jewish Daily Forward|date=January 3, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Aristocrats===
A minor controversy arose over Silverman's performance in the documentary film ''[[The Aristocrats (film)|The Aristocrats]]'' (2005). The film shows her doing the [[The Aristocrats|Aristocrats joke]] – a sample of [[transgressive art]] told by numerous comedians since the [[vaudeville]] era – like it was an autobiographical account of her life as a [[Child pornography|child sex performer]].  As part of the routine, she mentions that [[Joe Franklin]], a New York radio and TV personality whose nostalgic programs aired from the early 1950s until shortly before his death in 2015, would ask her to perform privately for him in his apartment. Silverman looks at the camera and, in a deadpan voice, accuses Franklin of raping her. The film was edited in such a way that it appears as if Franklin knows what Silverman said about him. Later, after her clip, Franklin is shown stating, "Sarah Silverman is a young lady to watch." After the film came out, Franklin took offense at Silverman's using his name in the routine and considered suing her. A month later, ''[[The New York Times]]'' noted he remained undecided but had said, "The best thing I could do is get Sarah better writers so she'd have funnier material."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/08/nyregion/08bold.html|work=The New York Times|title=Now We Feel We Really Know Her|first=Paula|last=Schwartz|date=September 8, 2005|accessdate=May 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She stated she does not want to have biological children because "there's just millions of kids that have no parents" in the world and to avoid the risk that they might inherit her depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/nov/02/entertainment/et-sarah2|page=2|title=Almost nothing is off-limits for Sarah Silverman|first=Robin|last=Abcarian|date=November 2, 2005|website=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=February 2, 2012|deadurl=no|archivedate=April 25, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425092547/http://articles.latimes.com/2005/nov/02/entertainment/et-sarah2/2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, Silverman also said that she has prioritized her artistic career, constantly on tour, instead of motherhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|user=SarahKSilverman|author=Sarah Silverman|number=836413899020738560|date=February 28, 2017|title=As a comic always working &amp;amp; on the road I have had to decide between motherhood &amp;amp; living my fullest life &amp;amp; I chose the latter.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Silverman endorsed Vermont Senator [[Bernie Sanders]] for President of the United States, saying, "He says what he means &amp; he means what he says &amp; he's not for sale." She had previously introduced Sanders at a rally in Los Angeles, California that drew an audience of over 27,500 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/meet-bernie-sanders-top-celebrity-backers/story?id=33020601|title=Meet Bernie Sanders' top celebrity backers|first1=Summer|last1=Fields|first2=Louise|last2=Simpson|publisher=ABC News|date=August 11, 2015|accessdate=30 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Silverman spoke at the [[2016 Democratic National Convention]] in support of [[Hillary Clinton]]. She urged other Sanders supporters to back Clinton and later, amid some boos from some Sanders supporters, said, "Can I just say? To the 'Bernie or Bust' people, you're being ridiculous."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/trailguide/la-na-democratic-convention-2016-live-a-blunt-message-from-sarah-silverman-1469496266-htmlstory.html|title=Democratic National Convention day 1: Bernie Sanders tells supporters, 'Hillary Clinton must become the next president of the United States'|accessdate=July 26, 2016|via=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Sarah Silverman" &gt;{{cite news|date=July 24, 2016|title=Democratic National Convention live updates: 'You're being ridiculous,' Sarah Silverman tells Sanders die-hards|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/trailguide/la-na-democratic-convention-2016-live-a-blunt-message-from-sarah-silverman-1469496266-htmlstory.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and ''[[Politico]]'' called this one of the most memorable moments of the night.&lt;ref name="WaPo day 1" &gt;{{cite news|date=July 25, 2016|title=Winners and losers from the first night of the Democratic convention|work=The Washington Post|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/07/25/winners-and-losers-from-the-1st-night-of-the-democratic-convention/
