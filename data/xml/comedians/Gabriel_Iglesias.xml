==Career==
Iglesias worked for a cell phone company in Los Angeles and in 1997 went into comedy full-time, though it resulted in his being evicted from his home and losing his car.&lt;ref name=DesertEntertainer/&gt;&lt;ref name=LasVegasWeekly&gt;Duck, Allison (July 23, 2009). [http://www.lasvegasweekly.com/news/2009/jul/23/gabriel-iglesias-fabulously-fluffy/ "Gabriel Iglesias: fabulously fluffy"]. ''Las Vegas Weekly''&lt;/ref&gt;

Iglesias often references his weight in his comedy, often saying, "Oh, I'm not fat, I'm fluffy".&lt;ref name=LasVegasWeekly/&gt;

In 2000, he appeared in season 6 of the [[Nickelodeon]] [[sketch comedy]] series ''[[All That]]'', co-starring with [[Amanda Bynes]] and [[Nick Cannon]].&lt;ref name=LasVegasWeekly/&gt;

In 2007, Iglesias voiced an entire Mexican family in "[[Padre de Familia]]", a [[Family Guy (season 6)|sixth season]] episode of the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox TV]] animated comedy ''[[Family Guy]]''. That same year, he began voicing a recurring set of identical twin characters on ''[[The Emperor's New School]]'', a Disney animated series that he describes as his favorite voice work.&lt;ref name=LasVegasWeekly/&gt;

Iglesias was a contestant on the [[Last Comic Standing 4|fourth season]] of reality TV series ''[[Last Comic Standing]]'' in 2006, surviving elimination to become one of the final eight comics. He was disqualified at that point for having used a smuggled [[BlackBerry]] to communicate with family and friends, which violated the rules of the show.&lt;ref name=LasVegasWeekly/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.realitytvworld.com/news/nbc-last-comic-standing-4-eliminates-three-reveals-top-5-finalists-4225.php|title=NBC's 'Last Comic Standing 4' eliminates three, reveals Top 5 finalists|date=July 12, 2006|work=Reality TV World|accessdate=October 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Comedy Central debuted ''[[Gabriel Iglesias Presents Stand Up Revolution]]'', a standup showcase series which Iglesias produces and hosts.

Iglesias has hosted/co-hosted six episodes of ''[[Ray William Johnson|Equals Three]]''. In 2012 he played a strip club DJ and drug dealer in the 2012 film ''[[Magic Mike]]''.

Iglesias voiced Ned and Zed in the 2013 [[DisneyToon Studios]] film, ''[[Planes (film)|Planes]]''.&lt;ref name=augusta&gt;{{cite news|last=Waits|first=Anne|title=Comedian Gabriel Iglesias ready to bring on the laughs|url=http://chronicle.augusta.com/things-do/applause/2013-12-11/comedian-gabriel-iglesias-ready-bring-laughs|accessdate=8 May 2014|newspaper=The Augusta Chronicle|date=11 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also voiced characters in the animated films ''[[The Nut Job]]'' (2014)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bickel|first=Britt|title=Gabriel Iglesias On His New Animated Movie 'The Nut Job'|url=http://kearth101.cbslocal.com/2014/01/24/gabriel-iglesias-on-his-new-animated-movie-the-nut-job/|accessdate=8 May 2014|date=24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rivera|first=Zayda|title=Gabriel Iglesias is a fluffy furry friend in 'The Nut Job'|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/gabriel-iglesias-fluffy-furry-friend-nut-job-article-1.1582084|newspaper=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|location=New York|date=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[El Americano: The Movie]]'' (2016).&lt;ref name=augusta/&gt;

Iglesias is featured in the new reality show ''Fluffy Breaks Even'', which is currently shown on [[Fuse (TV channel)|Fuse TV]].

==Awards and honors==
On February 10, 2012, Iglesias was presented with several awards by the city of [[El Paso, Texas]], including the key to the city and the Beacon of H.O.P.E Award from the nonprofit organization [[Operation H.O.P.E]].&lt;ref&gt;Hinojosa, Alex (February 10, 2012). [https://archive.is/20120730061347/http://www.elpasotimes.com/ci_19938025?source=most_viewed "Comedian Gabriel "Fluffy" Iglesias gets key to the city"]. ''[[El Paso Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
{{BLP sources section|date=August 2014}}
Iglesias lives in [[Whittier, California]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbc.com/Last_Comic_Standing/comics/gabriel_iglesias.shtml Gabriel Iglesias]. ''[[Last Comic Standing]]''. [[NBC]]. accessed October 7, 2011. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101029172804/http://www.nbc.com/Last_Comic_Standing/comics/gabriel_iglesias.shtml |date=October 29, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Fluffy Movie'', Iglesias describes how at his heaviest, which he states was {{Convert|445|lb|kg|abbr=off}}, he was diagnosed with [[Type II Diabetes]], and with his blood sugar spiking to over 300 regularly, was given two years to live by his doctor. He said the shock of being told he had two years to live prompted him to reevaluate how he took care of himself, and explained that he decided to lose weight in order to insure his continued presence in the lives of his loved ones. Iglesias described the struggle to incorporate a healthier lifestyle, relating how he was told by a specialist that his heavy touring schedule precluded him from being a candidate for [[bariatric surgery]], and how he resorted instead to weight-lifting, [[DDP Yoga|Diamond Dallas Page Yoga]], and a high-protein, low-carbohydrate diet, which helped him shed over {{Convert|100|lb|kg|abbr=off}}.
