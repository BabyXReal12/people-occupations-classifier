'''Graham William Walker''' (born 4 April 1963), known professionally as '''Graham Norton''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Norton|first=Graham| title=So Me|publisher=Hodder &amp; Stoughton|page=4|isbn=0-340-83348-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an Irish television and radio presenter, comedian, actor, and writer based in the [[United Kingdom]]. He is a five-time [[BAFTA TV Award]] winner for his comedy chat show ''[[The Graham Norton Show]]'' and an eight-time BAFTA award winner, overall. Originally shown on [[BBC Two]] before moving to other slots on [[BBC One]], it succeeded ''[[Friday Night with Jonathan Ross]]'' in BBC One's prestigious late-Friday-evening slot in 2010.&lt;ref name="BBC News"&gt;{{cite web|title=Graham Norton sells production company So TV to ITV|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-19433776|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=18 October 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104163040/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-19433776|archivedate=4 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also presents on [[BBC Radio 2]] and is the [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] television commentator of the [[Eurovision Song Contest]], which led ''[[Hot Press]]'' to describe him as "the 21st century's answer to [[Terry Wogan]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://hotpress.com/archive/2931306.html|title=Reasons to be cheerful|accessdate=20 June 2007|author=Bootboy|work=[[Hot Press]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100219065611/http://www.hotpress.com/archive/2931306.html|archivedate=19 February 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Norton is known for his [[innuendo]]-laden dialogue and flamboyant presentation style. In 2012, he sold his production company, [[So Television]], to [[ITV plc|ITV]] for around £17&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="BBC News"/&gt; In a 2004 poll for the BBC, Norton was named the eighth most influential person in [[Culture of the United Kingdom|British culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=iPod designer leads culture list|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/3481599.stm|publisher=BBC|date=18 March 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170810133452/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/3481599.stm|archivedate=10 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Norton was born in [[Clondalkin]], a suburb of [[Dublin]], and grew up in [[Bandon, County Cork]]. His family are members of the [[Church of Ireland]]. His father's family were from [[County Wicklow]], while his mother was [[Northern Irish people|Northern Irish]], from [[Belfast]].&lt;ref name="WDYTYA"/&gt; Norton took part in the TV programme [[Who Do You Think You Are? (UK TV series)|''Who Do You Think You Are?'']] to trace his ancestry. Despite discovering that his father's direct ancestors originated in [[Yorkshire]] and immigrated to Ireland during the [[Plantations of Ireland|Plantation period]], Norton said he was comforted to find that his family had resided in Ireland for generations.&lt;ref name="WDYTYA"&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/whodoyouthinkyouare/past-stories/graham-norton.shtml "Graham Norton"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100727061148/http://www.bbc.co.uk/whodoyouthinkyouare/past-stories/graham-norton.shtml |date=27 July 2010 }}. ''Who Do You Think You Are?''&lt;/ref&gt;

Norton was educated at [[Bandon Grammar School]], in [[West Cork]], and then [[University College, Cork]], where he spent two years studying English and French in the 1980s but did not complete his studies.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} In June 2013, he received an [[honorary doctorate]] from University College Cork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.independent.ie/woman/celeb-news/thats-dr-norton-to-you-comic-gets-honorary-degree-29329630.html|title= That's Dr Norton to you – comic gets honorary degree|work=[[Irish Independent]]|accessdate=11 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Norton moved to London and attended the [[Central School of Speech and Drama]].&lt;ref name="eveningstandard"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/grahams-growing-pains-7232416.html|title=Graham's growing pains|last=Jones|first=Liz|date=3 September 2004|work=[[London Evening Standard]]|accessdate=28 November 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002234500/http://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/grahams-growing-pains-7232416.html|archivedate=2 October 2012|deadurl=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also worked as a waiter during that time.&lt;ref&gt;''The F Word'', Season 4 Episode 12&lt;/ref&gt; Upon joining the actor's union [[Equity (trade union)|Equity]], he chose Norton (his great-grandmother's maiden name) as his stage name, as there was already an actor called Graham Walker.&lt;ref name="WDYTYA"/&gt;

==Career==
===Channel 4===
In 1992, Norton's stand-up comedy drag act as a tea-towel clad [[Mother Teresa|Mother Teresa of Calcutta]] in the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] made the press when [[Scottish Television]]'s religious affairs department mistakenly thought he represented the real Mother Teresa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Festival Eye|first=Adrian|last=Turpin|work=[[The Independent]]|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first appearances in broadcasting were in the UK, where he had a spot as a regular comedian and panellist on the [[BBC Radio 4]] show ''[[Loose Ends (radio)|Loose Ends]]'' in the early 1990s, when the show ran on Saturday mornings. His rise to fame began as one of the early successes of [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]], when he won an award for his performance as the stand-in host of a [[The Jack Docherty Show|late-night TV talk show]] usually presented by [[Jack Docherty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/3322069.stm|title=Graham Norton: Naughty but nice|accessdate=4 December 2011|publisher=[[BBC News]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170906004421/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/3322069.stm|archivedate=6 September 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/aug/14/broadcasting.business|title=Summer stand-ins steal the limelight|first=James|last=Robinson|work=[[The Observer]]|accessdate=4 December 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227191520/http://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/aug/14/broadcasting.business|archivedate=27 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by a comic [[quiz show]] on Channel 5 called ''[[Bring Me the Head of Light Entertainment]]'', which was not well received as a programme, but did enhance Norton's reputation as a comic and host. In 1996, he co-hosted the late-night quiz show [[Carnal Knowledge (TV series)|''Carnal Knowledge'']] on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] with [[Maria McErlane]].

In 1996, Norton played the part of [[List of Father Ted characters#Father Noel Furlong|Father Noel Furlong]] in three episodes ("[[Hell (Father Ted)|Hell]]", "[[Flight into Terror]]", "[[The Mainland (Father Ted)|The Mainland]]") of the [[Channel 4]] series ''[[Father Ted]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/baftas/10049417/Graham-Norton-the-making-of-a-national-treasure.html|title=Graham Norton: the making of a national treasure|last=Rainey|first=Sarah|date=10 May 2013|access-date=13 October 2017|issn=0307-1235|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171019140558/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/baftas/10049417/Graham-Norton-the-making-of-a-national-treasure.html|archivedate=19 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was set on the fictional "Craggy Island" off the west coast of Ireland. Father Furlong was often seen taking charge of the St. Luke's Youth Group.

After this early success, Norton moved to [[Channel 4]] to host his own chat shows including ''[[So Graham Norton]]'' and ''[[V Graham Norton]]''. As a performer who is not only openly gay,&lt;ref name=pinknews&gt;Cohen, Benjamin (27 April 2006).[http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-1295.html/ "Graham Norton: "I’m too old to be attractive to gay men"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111024152641/http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-1295.html |date=24 October 2011 }}. ''Pink News''. Retrieved 14 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; but also [[camp (style)|camp]] and flamboyant, it was here that Norton's act was fully honed as a cheeky, [[innuendo]]-laden joker.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

In 2003, he was the subject of controversy in the United Kingdom when, on his show on Channel 4, he made a comedic reference to the recent death of [[Bee Gees]] singer [[Maurice Gibb]]. The [[Independent Television Commission]] (I.T.C.) investigated after complaints about this insensitivity were received and eventually Channel 4 had to make two apologies: one in the form of a caption slide before the show, another from Norton in person.

Also in 2003, Norton was listed in ''[[The Observer]]'' as one of the 1000 funniest acts in [[British comedy]]. (Though Norton is Irish, the bulk of his television career has been in the UK.) In January 2004, he was named the [[Radio Times's Most Powerful People in TV Comedy|most powerful person in TV comedy]] by ''[[Radio Times]]''.&lt;ref name="2004 list"&gt;{{Cite news|author-link1=|date=12 January 2004|title=Norton tops comedy list|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/norton-tops-comedy-list-7229205.html|dead-url=no|newspaper=[[London Evening Standard]]|location=London|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6tRdoMxoY?url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/norton-tops-comedy-list-7229205.html|archive-date=13 September 2017|access-date=13 September 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 2004, Norton ventured into American television. ''[[The Graham Norton Effect]]'' debuted on 24 June 2004 on [[Comedy Central]], and was also broadcast in the UK on [[BBC Three (former)|BBC Three]]. In the midst of controversy surrounding [[Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy|Justin Timberlake and Janet Jackson's Super Bowl performance]], Norton was wary of moving into the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Norton|first=Graham|title=So Me|publisher=Hodder &amp; Stoughton|pages=326–333|isbn=0-340-83348-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===BBC===
====Television====
[[File:Graham Norton at the BAFTAs 2.jpg|thumb|250px|Norton at the 2009 BAFTA Awards]]
In 2005, Norton moved to the [[BBC]] and began hosting the Saturday evening reality TV series ''[[Strictly Dance Fever]]'' on [[BBC One]], as well as a new comedy chat show, ''[[Graham Norton's Bigger Picture]]''. He also read stories some nights on the BBC children's channel [[CBeebies]] as part of ''Bedtime Hour''.

In 2006, Norton hosted the BBC One series ''[[How Do You Solve A Problem Like Maria?]]'' in which [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] tried to find a lead actress for his West End version of ''[[The Sound of Music]]''. Norton has subsequently presented the three follow-up series: ''[[Any Dream Will Do (TV series)|Any Dream Will Do]]'' in 2007, in which a group of males competed to win the role of Joseph in the West End production of ''[[Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat]]''; ''[[I'd Do Anything (BBC TV series)|I'd Do Anything]]'' in 2008, in which Lloyd Webber seeks to find the parts of Nancy and Oliver for [[Sir Cameron Mackintosh]]'s production of [[Lionel Bart]]'s ''[[Oliver!]]''; and ''[[Over the Rainbow (2010 TV series)|Over the Rainbow]]'' in 2010, following a similar format to find a new [[Dorothy Gale|Dorothy]] for a ''[[Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|Wizard of Oz]]'' West end Production.

Norton hosted various other shows for the BBC during this time, including ''[[When Will I Be Famous? (TV series)|When Will I Be Famous?]]'' (2007),  ''[[The One and Only (TV series)|The One and Only]]'' (2008) and ''[[Totally Saturday]]'' (2009). Since 2007, Norton has also been a regular host of [[British Academy Television Awards|The British Academy Television Awards]]. On 7 July 2007, Norton presented at [[Live Earth]] and undertook a trip to [[Ethiopia]] with the [[Born Free Foundation]] to highlight the plight of the [[Ethiopian wolf]] – the rarest canid in the world. In the same year, he was the subject of an episode of the BBC1 genealogy documentary ''[[Who Do You Think You Are? (UK TV series)|Who Do You Think You Are?]]''.

Norton's chat show, ''[[The Graham Norton Show]]'', began on 22 February 2007 on [[BBC Two]]. The format is very similar to his previous Channel 4 shows. On 6 October 2009, the show moved to BBC One, in a new one-hour format.

In May 2010, he stood in for [[Chris Evans (presenter)|Chris Evans]]' breakfast show on [[BBC Radio 2]]. Later that month, it was confirmed that he would be replacing [[Jonathan Ross]]'s Saturday morning slot on the same station.

In December 2011, the panel show ''[[Would You Rather...? with Graham Norton]]'' premiered on [[BBC America]] in the time slot immediately following ''The Graham Norton Show''. Recorded in New York, it is one of BBC America's earliest efforts at producing original programming, and is also the first [[panel game]] the channel has shown, either of British or American origin.

====Radio====
Norton presents a Saturday morning show on [[BBC Radio 2]], featuring guest interviews and music.  It also features a "[[agony aunt]]" section with advice from [[Maria McErlane]] and Norton, called "Grill Graham".  "Tune with a Tale" is where a listener suggests playing a song with a plot, summarising the story it contains, and "[[I Can't Believe It's Not Butter!|I Can't Believe It's Not Better]]" is a feature where a listener requests a song that was previously a hit, but might be considered particularly bad now.

In January 2012, Norton asked listeners to his Radio 2 show to help find his car, shortly after it was stolen.  He called it "The Great Car Hunt" and told listeners to
"Keep your eyes out for it. It was filthy by the way."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Norton's radio hunt for his stolen car|url=http://www.rte.ie/ten/news/2012/0110/434785-nortong/|accessdate=1 August 2015|publisher=[[Raidió Teilifís Éireann]]|date=10 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Eurovision====
[[File:Josh Dubovie and Graham Norton.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Norton with [[Josh Dubovie]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2010]]]]
Norton, along with [[Claudia Winkleman]], hosted the first annual [[Eurovision Dance Contest 2007|Eurovision Dance Contest]], which was held on 1 September 2007 in London, England. The format was based on the BBC's ''[[Strictly Come Dancing]]'' and the [[European Broadcasting Union|EBU]]'s [[Eurovision Song Contest]]. Norton and Winkleman also hosted the [[Eurovision Dance Contest 2008|2008 Contest]] in Glasgow, Scotland.

In October 2008, it was confirmed by the [[BBC]] that Norton would replace [[Terry Wogan]] as the presenter of the UK heats of the [[Eurovision Song Contest]], ''[[UK national selection for the Eurovision Song Contest|Your Country Needs You]]''.

On 5 December 2008, it was announced that Norton would also take over from Wogan as the presenter of the main Eurovision Song Contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2008/12_december/05/eurovision.shtml|title=Eurovision: Norton to replace Wogan|work=BBC Press Release|publisher=BBC|accessdate=16 May 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208090534/http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2008/12_december/05/eurovision.shtml|archivedate=8 December 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 54th Eurovision Song Contest was held in the [[Olympic Stadium (Moscow)|Olympic Stadium]], Moscow on 16 May 2009.

Norton's debut jokes received some positive reviews from the British press. ''[[The Guardian]]'' noted his comments on [[Iceland in the Eurovision Song Contest 2009|Iceland]]'s entry, which finished in second place, had "rooted around in a cupboard and found an old bridesmaid dress from 1987" and the [[Armenia in the Eurovision Song Contest 2009|Armenian]] singers, who finished in 10th place, were sporting traditional dress, "which would be true if you come from the village where [[Liberace]] is the mayor."&lt;ref name="Norton's Eurovision debut reviewed"/&gt; ''[[The Times]]'' noted his highlighting of the arrest of 30 gay rights protesters in Moscow – "heavy-handed policing has really marred what has been a fantastic Eurovision."&lt;ref name="Norton's Eurovision debut reviewed"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8054164.stm "Norton's Eurovision debut reviewed"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090522195109/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8054164.stm |date=22 May 2009 }}. BBC News (BBC). 09:44 GMT, Sunday, 17 May 2009, 10:44 UK.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 Norton, along with [[Petra Mede]], hosted the ''[[Eurovision's Greatest Hits]]'' concert show on 31 March at the [[Eventim Apollo]], in [[Hammersmith]], London to commemorate the Contest's 60th anniversary.

===Other===
Norton played Mr. Puckov in the 2006 American comedy spoof film ''[[Another Gay Movie]]''. In 2007, Norton played Taylor in the [[romantic comedy]] film, ''[[I Could Never Be Your Woman]]''.

Norton was involved in a high-publicity advertising campaign for the UK [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery]] as an animated [[unicorn]], the stooge to a character based on [[Fortuna (luck)|Lady Luck]] (played by [[Fay Ripley]]). He has also advertised [[McVitie's]] [[biscuits]].

In 2007, Norton featured in [[Girls Aloud]] and [[Sugababes]]' [[Comic Relief (charity)|Comic Relief]] video for the single "[[Walk This Way#Sugababes vs. Girls Aloud version|Walk This Way]]"

In January 2009, Norton made his West End stage debut in a revival of ''[[La Cage aux Folles (musical)|La Cage Aux Folles]]'' at the Playhouse Theatre.

In 2009, Norton was the host of the comedy game-show ''Most Popular'' on US cable television channel [[WE tv]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wetv.com/most-popular/ |title=Most Popular Bio: Graham Norton – WE tv |publisher=Wetv.com |date=20 July 2012 |accessdate=4 July 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110211012315/http://www.wetv.com/most-popular |archivedate=11 February 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Norton currently writes an advice column in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' newspaper. In October 2010, these columns were made into a book entitled ''Ask Graham'', published by John Blake Publishing.

On 7 March 2013, Norton broke the [[Guinness World Records|Guinness World Record]] for "Most Questions Asked on a TV Chat Show" on ''Comic Relief's Big Chat'', which raised £1.02&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/news/a464259/graham-norton-breaks-world-record-and-raises-gbp1-million-with-big-chat.html |title=Graham Norton breaks world record and raises £1&amp;nbsp;million with Big Chat – TV News |work=Digital Spy |accessdate=11 March 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130310030340/http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/news/a464259/graham-norton-breaks-world-record-and-raises-gbp1-million-with-big-chat.html |archivedate=10 March 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Norton attacked the decision by Irish broadcaster [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]] to settle out of court with opponents of gay marriage who claimed they had been defamed in an edition of the ''[[Saturday Night Show]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-26287377|title=Graham Norton 'furious' over RTE homophobia payout|publisher=BBC News|date=21 February 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221160108/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-26287377|archivedate=21 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Norton publicly backed "[[Hacked Off]]" and its campaign toward UK press self-regulation by "safeguarding the press from political interference while also giving vital protection to the vulnerable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/benedict-cumberbatch-alfonso-cuaron-maggie-689289 |title=Benedict Cumberbatch, Alfonso Cuaron, Maggie Smith Back U.K. Press Regulation |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=18 March 2014 |accessdate=4 July 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140607221419/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/benedict-cumberbatch-alfonso-cuaron-maggie-689289 |archivedate=7 June 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ian |last=Burrell |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/press/campaign-group-hacked-off-urge-newspaper-industry-to-back-the-royal-charter-on-press-freedom-9197869.html |title=Campaign group Hacked Off urge newspaper industry to back the Royal Charter on press freedom – Press – Media |work=The Independent |date=18 March 2014 |accessdate=4 July 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714094012/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/press/campaign-group-hacked-off-urge-newspaper-industry-to-back-the-royal-charter-on-press-freedom-9197869.html |archivedate=14 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The Leveson Royal Charter Declaration| url=http://hackinginquiry.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/4282-HackedOff-Guardian-ad-286x440-d3.png| publisher=[[Media Standards Trust#Hacked Off|Hacked Off]]| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150302093453/http://hackinginquiry.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/4282-HackedOff-Guardian-ad-286x440-d3.png |archive-date=2 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2014, Norton released his second memoir, ''The Life and Loves of a He-Devil''. It won in the Non-Fiction Book of the Year category at the 2014 [[Irish Book Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishbookawards.ie/nominee/the-life-and-loves-of-a-he-devil-a-memoir/|title=The Life and Loves of a He Devil|date=14 December 2014|work=Irish Book Awards|accessdate=19 December 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141219124730/http://www.irishbookawards.ie/nominee/the-life-and-loves-of-a-he-devil-a-memoir/|archivedate=19 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2014, he was named in the top 10 on the World Pride Power list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Pride Power List 2014 |url=http://www.worldpridepowerlist.com/ |work=The Guardian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208160458/http://www.worldpridepowerlist.com/ |archivedate=8 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2015, the [[Bishop of Cork]], Dr. [[Paul Colton]], hosted an evening with Norton involving 90 minutes of interview, questions, and answers with an audience of more than 400 people. The event, part of the West Cork Literary Festival, was sold out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ireland.anglican.org/news/5794 |title=Bishop Paul Colton Hosts an Evening with Graham Norton at West Cork Literary Festival |publisher=Ireland.anglican.org |date=20 July 2015 |accessdate=7 April 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160419020642/http://ireland.anglican.org/news/5794 |archivedate=19 April 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
[[File:Graham Norton with Dog.jpg|thumb|Norton with his dog Bailey in 2006, supporting [[Crusaid]]]]
In 1989, Norton was mugged, beaten, and stabbed by a group of attackers on a street in London. He lost half of his blood and nearly died, and was hospitalised for two-and-a-half weeks. Norton eventually recovered from the attack and has openly joked about it on-air.&lt;ref name="eveningstandard" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/8034256/Graham-Norton-agony-uncle.html|title=Graham Norton: agony uncle|last=Norton|first=Graham|date=2 October 2010|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=28 November 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110624082858/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/8034256/Graham-Norton-agony-uncle.html|archivedate=24 June 2011|deadurl=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; During filming of the [[BBC]]'s 2013 Christmas advert, he coincidentally had to film in the spot of the attack (unbeknownst to the directors), and said he felt momentarily uneasy.{{Cn|date=August 2018}}
