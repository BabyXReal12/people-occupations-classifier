[[File:Boothy Graffoe Ships Dip III.jpg|right]]
'''Boothby Graffoe''' (born '''James Martyn Rogers''', 20 October 1962), is an [[England|English]] [[comedian]], [[singer]], [[songwriter]] and [[playwright]]. He is particularly known for his surreal sense of humour and work with Canadian band [[Barenaked Ladies]].

==Early life==
Rogers was born in 1962 in [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]], [[East Riding of Yorkshire]], [[England]]. For the latter part of his schooling, he attended the [[Queen Elizabeth's Grammar School, Horncastle|Queen Elizabeth's Grammar School]] in [[Horncastle, Lincolnshire|Horncastle]]. At the age of 18, he became a member of the [[Redcoats (Butlins)|redcoats]] at a [[Butlins]] on the south coast. He named his [[alter ego]] after an [[Boothby Graffoe|English village]] while driving back from a gig in the late 1980s. His family still live in the [[Tattershall]] area. He claims to be the only comedian in the world named after a [[Lincolnshire]] village.

==Stand-up comedy==
Graffoe often incorporates guitar playing into his stage act, through his oddball (and usually slightly twisted) songs, including such titles as "Planet Dog", "Woof" and his album's title track, "Wot Italian" (sometimes referred to as "Umbrella Head Boy"). Some of his song titles are still more surreal, in that they do not reflect the subject matter, such as "Giraffes Don't Play Harmonicas, So It Can't Be a Giraffe" and "The Consequences of Living in a Container". He is currently accompanied by the violinist [[Nick Pynn]], having previously toured with acoustic guitarist [[Antonio Forcione]].

He explained his reasons for increasingly irrelevant song titles as — essentially — ways to avoid giving away the key phrases or punchlines in his songs. For instance, he renamed "Umbrella Head Boy" to "Wot Italian" after realising that audiences familiar with his work would ask him to "Play Umbrella Head Boy", thus rendering the surprise element of this line in the song redundant to others.

In 2005 he participated in the Danish stand-up tour "Stand-up DK|UK|OK" with Danish comedians [[Rune Klan]], [[Carsten Eskelund]] and [[Christian Geo Heltboe|Geo]], this went on tour around Denmark and was never released on DVD.

On a tour of Scotland in February–March 2007, Graffoe announced his intention to retire from stand-up comedy and concentrate on writing for [[Omid Djalili]]. He subsequently toured as a warm-up act for Djalili and [[Barenaked Ladies]], but has recently announced a new tour&lt;ref name="TROBG"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.thereturnofboothbygraffoe.co.uk |title=The Return of Boothby Graffoe |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521105656/http://www.thereturnofboothbygraffoe.co.uk/ |archivedate=21 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and album (''Songs for Dogs' Funerals''). He is a regular performer at the annual [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]].

Graffoe has won several awards, including the 2002 [[Adelaide Fringe]] Award for Excellence, and the [[Time Out (company)|Time Out]] Comedy Award. He has been nominated for British comedy's prestigious [[Perrier Award]].

==Radio==
Graffoe started his career in 1988 on [[BBC Radio Lincolnshire]], when he presented a two-hour programme (''Boothby Graffoe Live'') on Friday evenings until late 1990.

He appeared regularly on Radio 4's ''[[Loose Ends (radio)|Loose Ends]]'' with [[Ned Sherrin]].

* ''[[The Big Booth (radio show)|The Big Booth]]'' BBC Radio 4 (2000–01)
* ''[[Boothby Graffoe In No Particular Order (radio show)|Boothby Graffoe in No Particular Order]]'' BBC Radio 4 (2003–05)

==Television==
In 2003, Graffoe appeared on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'' and also caused a stir on ''[[Opportunity Knocks (UK TV series)|Opportunity Knocks]]'' during the late 1980s when he wrapped sellotape around his head for comedy effect.
In 2013 he appeared as one of a number of acts in [[The Alternative Comedy Experience]] performing at The Stand in Edinburgh and also being interviewed backstage by the curator of the show [[Stewart Lee]].

==Music==
In 2004 he released his first album of songs with Antonio Forcione, ''Wot Italian?''. A second disc followed in 2006, a live recording of a show in [[Brighton]] billed as ''Boothby Graffoe &amp; the Following People'', the backing band including Nick Pynn.

Boothby has acted as support for Canadian band [[Barenaked Ladies]] on its "Last Summer on Earth" 2013 tour and on three of Barenaked Ladies' UK tours: first in 2004 for the ''Barenaked for the Holidays'' tour, then in 2007 on the ''Barenaked Ladies Are Me'' tour and again in 2010 on the band's ''All In Good Time'' tour. Boothby mostly performs solo, with various members of the band joining him to play bass ([[Jim Creeggan]]), keyboard ([[Kevin Hearn]]) and drums (guitarist [[Ed Robertson]]) for some of the songs.

In January 2008, Graffoe joined the line-up for Barenaked Ladies' cruise ''Ships and Dip'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.shipsanddip.com/ |title=Ships and Dip III}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he performed solo and with members from BNL and other bands on board. The cruise, with a capacity of 2500, provided some North American attendees with their first experiences with Graffoe and his comedy. He returned for two further ''Ships and Dip'' cruises in 2009 and 2011.

Boothby's third album, "Songs For Dogs, Funerals....." was released in February 2011, featuring studio recordings of three tracks from "Boothby Graffoe &amp; The Following People" together with a selection of all-new tracks. Musicians appearing on the album included Nick Pynn, Theseus Gerard and Dean Friedman.

His fourth album, "Bang! Is This Your Vehicle, Sir?" was released on 27 February 2012. The album features guest appearances from Nick Pynn, [[Kevin Hearn]], [[Omid Djalili]], and members of Canadian band [[Thin Buckle]].

A fifth album, "Nomad", was released in March 2013, following a successful campaign on [[Kickstarter]].

He has championed the work of surreal songwriter Syd Meats, often including Meats' songs, such as "Far Too Serious", in his set.

In the summer of 2013, served as the first act on Barenaked Ladies' 'Last Summer On Earth Tour,' which also featured [[Guster]] and [[Ben Folds Five]].
