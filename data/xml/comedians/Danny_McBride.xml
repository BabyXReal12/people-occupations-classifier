In March 2009, because of his role as Powers, he received an offer to play professional baseball for the [[Pensacola Pelicans]], a minor league team in the [[American Association of Independent Professional Baseball]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pensacola Pelicans kick off season May 14 with great talent|url=http://www.splashpensacolabeach.com/news/2009-05-01/Home/002.html|work=Splash!

McBride is currently{{when?|date=January 2018}} co-writing a script with [[David Gordon Green]] for [[Halloween (2018 film)|a sequel]] to ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'', to be directed by Green and produced by series creator [[John Carpenter]] and [[Jason Blum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3424120/david-gordon-green-danny-mcbride-rebooting-halloween-october-2018/|title=David Gordon Green and Danny McBride Rebooting 'Halloween' for October 2018 - Bloody Disgusting!|website=bloody-disgusting.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Galluzzo|first1=Rob|title=David Gordon Green, Danny McBride Will Direct/Write The New HALLOWEEN Movie For Blumhouse!|url=http://www.blumhouse.com/2017/02/09/david-gordon-green-danny-mcbride-will-directwrite-the-new-halloween-movie-for-blumhouse/|website=[[Blumhouse Productions|Blumhouse]]|accessdate=15 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.stereogum.com/1966097/qa-john-carpenter-talks-new-album-anthology-the-upcoming-halloween-sequel/franchises/interview/ |title=Q&amp;A: John Carpenter Talks New Album Anthology &amp; The Upcoming Halloween Sequel |last=Daw |first=Robbie |date=2017-10-09 |website=[[Stereogum]] |access-date=2017-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In January 2018, two trailers were released online for what was supposedly a ''[[Crocodile Dundee]]'' sequel, titled ''Dundee: The Son of a Legend Returns Home''. The film was said to star McBride as Brian Dundee, the son of the original Crocodile Dundee. The trailers also feature cameo appearances by Australian actors [[Chris Hemsworth]], [[Hugh Jackman]], [[Russell Crowe]], [[Margot Robbie]], and [[Ruby Rose]].&lt;ref name="Snopes"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Garcia|first1=Arturo|title=Is a 'Crocodile Dundee' Sequel Being Released in 2018?|url=https://www.snopes.com/fake-crocodile-dundee-trailer/|website=Snopes|accessdate=24 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the beginning, various aspects of the campaign made some publications believe that film was an elaborate hoax.&lt;ref name="Brisbane"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moran|first1=Rob|title=Crocodile Dundee reboot outed as advertising campaign for Tourism Australia|url=https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/sport/nfl/crocodile-dundee-reboot-outed-as-advertising-campaign-for-tourism-australia-20180124-h0nlmz.html|website=Brisbane Times|accessdate=24 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later reported that these ads were actually part of a lead up to a [[Super Bowl commercial]] for [[Tourism Australia]].&lt;ref name="Brisbane"/&gt;
