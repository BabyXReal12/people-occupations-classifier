(U.S. TV series)|the American version]], hosted by [[Drew Carey]], which was his first stateside television exposure.

In 2003, Brady won a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program]] for his work on the show, the only person to win the award for a television series, as opposed to a special, since [[Dana Carvey]] in 1993.

He went on to star in his own [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] variety show in 2001, ''The Wayne Brady Show'', and a daytime talk show of the same name in 2002, which lasted two seasons and won four [[Daytime Emmy Award]]s, two of which went to Brady for Outstanding Talk Show Host. Brady guest-starred on ''[[The Drew Carey Show]]'' in 1999 and 2000 to take part in "[[Drew Live]]" and "[[Drew Live II]]". On the show, Brady played several games taken from ''Whose Line Is It Anyway?'' for the two episodes with other characters.

"Beautiful" (Christmas version) from ''Disney's Princess Christmas Album''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Brady became the host of [[TV Land]]'s ''That's What I'm Talking About'', a talk show discussing the role of African-Americans in the entertainment industry. From August 29 to September 29, 2006, Brady hosted the Fox show ''[[Celebrity Duets]]''.

Brady made several guest appearances on the CBS sitcom ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]'', playing James Stinson, the [[gay]] brother of [[Neil Patrick Harris]]'s character, [[Barney Stinson]]. Brady has also appeared as a guest star for the MTV show ''[[Wild 'N Out]]'', and lent his voice to the [[Adult Swim]] show ''[[Robot Chicken]]''.

Brady guest-starred in the [[CBC Television|CBC]] comedy ''[[Getting Along Famously]]'' alongside his ''Whose Line is It Anyway?'' costar [[Colin Mochrie]]. He has also appeared on the episode "You Don't Know Jack" of the television show ''[[Dirt (TV series)|Dirt]]'', and also guest-starred on ''[[30 Rock]]'' as Steven Black, Liz Lemon's date for the Source Awards. He co-hosted the short-lived [[VH1]] show ''Vinyl Justice'' in 1998. In 2007, he starred in the [[ABC Family]] film ''The List''. He starred in ''Flirt'', a comedy pilot which was not picked up by the network.&lt;ref&gt;Dana Slagle, [https://books.google.com/books?id=kDoDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA61&amp;dq=Flirt+%22Wayne+Brady%22&amp;ei=IMiYSbKUMZ2EzgTguYGYDw 61 "Comedic Actor Wayne Brady Demonstrates Versatility In New Movie, 'Crossover'"], ''Jet'' 110.11 (September 18, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

Brady guest-starred as [[Julius (Everybody Hates Chris)|Julius Rock]]'s gifted younger brother, Louis, in the sitcom ''[[Everybody Hates Chris]]'', and hosted a singing game show called ''[[Don't Forget the Lyrics!]]'' on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] until its cancellation in June 2009. He performs "Wayne Brady: Making $%!^ up" at the [[The Venetian, Las Vegas|Venetian Hotel]] in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]] four nights a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.songkick.com/venues/825086-wayne-brady-theatre-venetian-casino-hotel-and-resort|title=Wayne Brady Theatre, Venetian Casino, Hotel &amp; Resort Las Vegas, Tickets for Concerts &amp; Music Events 2018 – Songkick|website=www.songkick.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He appeared on two episodes of ''Kevin Hill''. Brady's debut album was released on September 16, 2008. Brady's version of [[Sam Cooke]]'s "[[A Change is Gonna Come]]" earned him a [[Grammy Award]] nomination in the [[Best Traditional R&amp;B Vocal Performance]] category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waynebrady.com/news/newsItem.cfm?cms_news_id=40|title=News » Grammy Nomination|publisher=Wayne Brady|date=2008-04-12|accessdate=2010-05-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100504175535/http://www.waynebrady.com/news/newsItem.cfm?cms_news_id=40|archivedate=2010-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brady started hosting an updated version of the game show ''[[Let's Make a Deal]]'' for CBS in October 2009, which taped at the [[Tropicana Resort and Casino]] in Las Vegas and currently tapes in Los Angeles. The show replaced the soap opera ''[[Guiding Light]]'', which ended its long run. The original host of ''Let's Make a Deal'' was [[Monty Hall]], who served as consultant for the new show until his death in 2017. [[Drew Carey]] currently hosts ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]'', and thus, both game shows in the CBS daytime lineup (as of September 2017) hold the distinction of being hosted by an alumnus of ''Whose Line Is It Anyway?''

Brady was the [[List of WWE Raw guest hosts|guest host]] on the May 3, 2010, episode of ''[[WWE Raw]]'', where he was involved in an in-ring segment with [[Adam Copeland|Edge]] and [[Randy Orton]], eventually getting RKO'd by Orton.

Brady appeared alongside ''Let's Make a Deal'' announcer [[Jonathan Mangum]] in two episodes of ''[[Fast and Loose (2011 TV series)|Fast and Loose]]'', an improvisational series on [[BBC2]] hosted by [[Hugh Dennis]], in January 2011. Then, with [[Holly Robinson Peete]], he co-hosted the 42nd annual [[NAACP Image Awards]] on March 4, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2011/02/08/wayne-brady-and-holly-robinson-peete-to-host-42nd-naacp-image-awards-friday-march-4-on-fox/81922|publisher=Tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com|title=Wayne Brady and Holly Robinson Peete to Host '42nd NAACP Image Awards' Friday, March 4 on Fox – Ratings|accessdate=2012-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 3, 2011, he appeared on ''[[Dancing With The Stars]]'' as the lead performer in a tribute to [[James Brown]], celebrating what would have been Brown's 78th birthday in the Macy's Stars of Dance segment. He has also been a special guest of ''[[Drew Carey's Improv-A-Ganza]]'' on [[Game Show Network|GSN]].

Brady made a cameo in the 2011 song "Dedication To My Ex (Miss That)" by [[Lloyd (singer)|Lloyd]] featuring [[Lil Wayne]] and [[Andre 3000]], narrating Lil Wayne's section of the song. He appeared as a special guest star in the March 14, 2012, episode of the TV series ''[[Psych (TV series)|Psych]]''.

In 2007, Brady became an official supporter of [[Ronald McDonald House Charities]] and is a member of their celebrity board, the Friends of RMHC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rmhc.com/celebrity-friends|title=Celebrity Friends of RMHC|publisher=McDonald's Corporation|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121005440/http://rmhc.com/celebrity-friends|archivedate=2008-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, [[Bill Maher]] compared Brady to President [[Barack Obama]], in that they were both supposedly "not black enough". Brady took issue with this statement, suggesting that Maher should "be careful when [he makes] statements like that" because it will allow his viewers to make the same stereotypical assumptions about black people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediaite.com/tv/wayne-brady-calls-bullsht-on-bill-maher-i-will-beat-your-ass-in-public-for-questioning-my-black-cred|title=Wayne Brady Calls ‘Bullsh*t’ On Bill Maher: ‘I Will Beat Your Ass In Public’ For Questioning My Black Cred|date=May 15, 2013|work=mediaite.com|accessdate=September 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/13/wayne-brady-to-bill-maher_n_3268077.html|title=Wayne Brady To Bill Maher: 'I Will Beat Your Ass In Public' (VIDEO)|date=May 13, 2013|work=Huffington Post|access-date=July 16, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a child, Wayne struggled with [[stuttering]] due to a great deal of [[anxiety]] he felt from being [[Bullying|bullied]] by other children.&lt;ref name=WellBuzz&gt;{{cite web|last1=Herard|first1=Cathy|title=Dr Oz: Wayne Brady Stuttering Struggle &amp; Rachael Ray Vocal Cord Cyst|url=http://www.wellbuzz.com/dr-oz-womens-health-2/dr-oz-wayne-brady-stuttering-struggle-rachael-ray-vocal-cord-cyst|website=WellBuzz|publisher=WellBuzz|accessdate=July 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
