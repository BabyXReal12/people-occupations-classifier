Drescher and Jacobson attended [[Queens College, City University of New York]], but dropped out in their first year because "all the acting classes were filled." They then enrolled in [[cosmetology]] school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Suzanne|first1=Gerber|title=The fear Fran Drescher had to face|journal=[[Redbook]]|date=January 1996|volume=186|issue=3|page=60|issn=0034-2106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Early career===
Drescher's first break was a small role as the dancer Connie in the blockbuster movie ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'' (1977), in which she delivered the line "So, are you as good in bed as you are on the dance floor?" to [[John Travolta]]'s character. A year later, she began to gain more attention in films such as ''[[American Hot Wax]]'' (1978) and ''[[Summer of Fear]]'' (1978). She also took on a rare dramatic role in the 1981 [[Miloš Forman]] film, ''[[Ragtime (film)|Ragtime]]''.

During the 1980s, Drescher found moderate success as a [[character actress]] with memorable roles in films such as ''[[Gorp (film)|Gorp]]'' (1980), ''[[The Hollywood Knights]]'' (1980), ''[[Doctor Detroit]]'' (1983), ''[[The Big Picture (1989 film)|The Big Picture]]'' (1989), ''[[UHF (film)|UHF]]'' (1989), ''[[Cadillac Man]]'' (1990), and memorably in ''[[This Is Spinal Tap]]'' (1984) as publicist Bobbi Flekman. She also made an appearance in a second-season episode of ''[[Who's the Boss?]]'' in 1985 as an interior decorator. She also had an appearance on [[Night Court]] as a woman with dissociative identity disorder who flips from a prude to a sexually minded woman and ends up in a hotel with ADA [[Dan Fielding]].

In 1990, Drescher appeared as Roxanne, in ''[[ALF (TV series)|ALF]]'' the wife of grown up Brian, who had no clue she was the Mob Boss, in the episode "Future's So Bright I Gotta Wear Shades".

In 1991, Drescher co-starred on the short-lived CBS sitcom ''[[Princesses (TV series)|Princesses]]''. In the early-to-mid 1990s, she voiced "Peggy" from ''The P Pals'' on [[PBS]] (the woman with the flower on her hat).

===''The Nanny'' and later film roles===
Drescher and Jacobson created their own television show, ''[[The Nanny]]'', in 1993. The show aired on [[CBS]] from 1993 to 1999, and Drescher became an instant star. In this sitcom, she played a woman named Fran Fine who casually became the nanny of Margaret ("Maggie") (played by [[Nicholle Tom]]), Brighton ("B") (played by [[Benjamin Salisbury]]), and Grace ("Gracie") Sheffield (played by [[Madeline Zima]]); with her wit and her charm, she endeared herself to their widower father: stuffy, composed, proper British gentleman, and Broadway producer Maxwell Sheffield ([[Charles Shaughnessy]]). She reprised her ''This is Spinal Tap'' character of Bobbi Flekman, a look-alike for her Fran Fine character, in Season 5, Episode 3 of ''The Nanny''.

Drescher appeared in ''[[Jack (1996 film)|Jack]]'' (1996), directed by [[Francis Ford Coppola]], ''[[The Beautician and the Beast]]'' (1997) (for which she was also executive producer) and ''[[Picking Up the Pieces (film)|Picking Up the Pieces]]'' (2000) co-starring [[Woody Allen]]. She was also the voice of "Pearl" in ''[[Shark Bait]]'' (2006).

===Return to television===
In the 2000s, Drescher made a return to television both with leading and guest roles. In 2003, Drescher appeared in episodes of the short lived sitcom, ''[[Good Morning, Miami]]'' as Roberta Diaz. In 2005, she returned with the sitcom ''[[Living with Fran]]'', in which she played Fran Reeves, a middle-aged mother of two, living with Riley Martin ([[Ryan McPartlin]]), a man half her age and not much older than her son. Former ''Nanny'' costar [[Charles Shaughnessy]] appeared as her philandering ex-husband, Ted. ''Living with Fran'' was cancelled on May 17, 2006, after two seasons.

In 2006, Drescher guest starred in an episode of ''[[Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent]]''; the episode, "The War at Home", aired on US television on November 14, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=TV.com |url=http://www.tv.com/law-and-order-criminal-intent/the-war-at-home/episode/913601/summary.html?tag=ep_list;title;7 |title=Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent - Season 6, Episode 8: The War at Home |website=TV.com |date=2006-11-14 |accessdate=2016-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also appeared in an episode of ''[[Entourage (U.S. TV series)|Entourage]]'' and in the same year, gave her voice to the role of a female [[golem]] in ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[Treehouse of Horror XVII]]". In 2007, Drescher appeared in the US version of the Australian improvisational comedy series ''[[Thank God You're Here (U.S. TV series)|Thank God You're Here]]''.

In 2008, Drescher announced that she was developing a new sitcom entitled ''The New Thirty'', also starring [[Rosie O'Donnell]]. A series about two old high school friends coping with midlife crises, Drescher described the premature plot of the show as "kind of ''[[Sex and the City]]'' but we ain't getting any! It'll probably be more like ''[[The Odd Couple (1970 TV series)|The Odd Couple]]''."&lt;ref name="tnt"&gt;{{cite web|first=Julie|last= Gordon|url=http://www.newsday.com/buzz-rosie-o-donnell-fran-drescher-combine-for-tv-s-whiniest-sitcom-1.880364|title=BUZZ: Rosie O'Donnell, Fran Drescher combine for TV's whiniest sitcom?|work=[[Newsday]]|date=May 22, 2008|accessdate=March 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sitcom failed to materialize however.&lt;ref name="tnt"/&gt; In 2010, Drescher returned to television with her own daytime talk show, ''[[The Fran Drescher Tawk Show]]''. While the program debuted to strong ratings, it ended its three-week test run to moderate success, resulting in its shelving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Paige |last=Albiniak|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/460398-Audiences_Still_Love_The_Nanny_.php|title=Audiences Still Love ''The Nanny''|work=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|date=November 29, 2011|accessdate=March 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Paige |last=Albiniak|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/461400-Syndies_Flat_as_Holiday_Season_Revs_Up.php|title=Syndies Flat as Holiday Season Revs Up|work=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|date=December 21, 2011|accessdate=March 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, the sitcom ''[[Happily Divorced]]'', created by Drescher and her ex-husband, Peter Marc Jacobson, was picked up by [[TV Land]] for a ten-episode order. It premiered there June 15, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/celebritology/post/fran-drescher-talks-being-happily-divorced-from-gay-ex-husband/2011/06/14/AGJ4lhUH_blog.html |publisher=Washington Post |date=June 14, 2011 |title=Fran Drescher talks being 'Happily Divorced' from gay ex-husband |author=Sarah Anne Hughes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show was renewed in July 2011 for a second season of 12 episodes, which aired in spring 2012.  On May 1, 2012, TV Land extended the second season and picked up 12 additional episodes, taking the second season total to 24. The back-order of season two debuted later in 2012. ''Happily Divorced'' was cancelled in August 2013.

To promote ''[[Happily Divorced]]'', Drescher performed the weddings of three gay couples in New York City using the minister's license she received from the [[Universal Life Church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themonastery.org/blog/2012/03/ulc-minister-fran-drescher-to-officiate-gay-wedding/ |title=ULC Minister Fran Drescher to Officiate Gay Wedding - Universal Life Church Monastery Blog |website=Themonastery.org |date=2012-03-05 |accessdate=2016-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drescher hand-picked the three couples, all of whom were entrants into "Fran Drescher's 'Love Is Love' Gay Marriage Contest" on Facebook, based on the stories the couples submitted about how they met, why their relationship illustrated that "love is love" and why they wanted to be married by her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fran-drescher-to-marry-three-gay-couples-in-new-york-city-on-tuesday-march-6-139320183.html;title;7 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415223357/http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fran-drescher-to-marry-three-gay-couples-in-new-york-city-on-tuesday-march-6-139320183.html |archivedate=April 15, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Broadway===
Drescher made her [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] debut on February 4, 2014, in the revival of [[Richard Rodgers|Rodgers]] and [[Oscar Hammerstein II|Hammerstein]]'s ''[[Cinderella (2013 Broadway production)|Cinderella]]''.&lt;ref name=thr /&gt; She replaced [[Harriet Sansom Harris|Harriet Harris]] as stepmother Madame for a 10-week engagement.

==Personal life==

In January 1985, two armed robbers broke into Drescher and Jacobson's Los Angeles apartment. While one ransacked their home, Drescher and a female friend were raped by the other at gunpoint. Jacobson was also physically attacked, tied up, and forced to witness the entire ordeal. It took Drescher many years to recover, and it took her even longer to tell her story to the press. She was paraphrased as saying in an interview with [[Larry King]] that although it was a traumatic experience, she found ways to turn it into something positive. In her book ''Cancer Schmancer'', the actress writes: "My whole life has been about changing negatives into positives." Her rapist, who was on parole at the time of the crime, was returned to prison and given two life sentences.&lt;ref name=FranCNN&gt;{{cite news |title= LARRY KING LIVE Interview with Fran Drescher|url= http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0205/06/lkl.00.html|date= May 6, 2002|publisher= CNN|accessdate=July 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After separating in 1996, Drescher and Jacobson divorced in 1999. They had no children. Drescher stated, "I would have been able to conceive but not hold on."&lt;ref name=FranCNN/&gt; Drescher has worked to support LGBT rights issues after [[Peter Marc Jacobson#Personal life|her former husband came out]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-31749_162-20006739-10391698.html Fran Drescher's Ex-Husband Peter Marc Jacobson Is Gay, Shows Support]&lt;/ref&gt; Drescher has stated that the primary reason for the divorce was her need to change directions in life.  Drescher and Jacobson remain friends and business partners.  She has stated that "we choose to be in each other's lives in any capacity. Our love is unique, rare, and unconditional; unless he's being annoying."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guyspy.com/modern-family-peter-marc-jacobson-success-sexuality-and-being-love-fran-drescher Modern Family – Peter Marc Jacobson on Success, Sexuality, and Being in Love with Fran Drescher].

===Cancer battle===
[[File:Fran Drescher, dancer against cancer press conference 2010 (2).jpg|250px|thumb|left|Drescher at a press conference for the Austrian charity Dancer Against Cancer, 2010]]

After two years of symptoms and misdiagnoses by eight doctors, Drescher was admitted to Los Angeles's [[Cedars Sinai Hospital]] on June 21, 2000, after doctors diagnosed her with [[uterine cancer]]. She had to undergo an immediate radical [[hysterectomy]] to treat the disease. Drescher was given a clean bill of health and no post-operative treatment was ordered.

She wrote about her experiences in her second book, ''Cancer Schmancer''.&lt;ref name=FranCNN/&gt; Her purpose for this book was to raise consciousness for men and women "to become more aware of the early warning signs of cancer, and to empower themselves." Drescher says, "I was going to learn what I needed to learn, ask questions, become partners with my doctor instead of having some kind of parent/child relationship."

===Cancer Schmancer Movement===
On June 21, 2007, the seventh anniversary of her operation, Drescher announced the national launch of the Cancer Schmancer Movement, a non-profit organization dedicated to ensuring that all women's cancers be diagnosed while in Stage 1, the most curable stage. She celebrated her tenth year of wellness on June 21, 2010.

Drescher says: 

{{quote|We need to take control of our bodies, become greater partners with our physicians and galvanize as one to let our legislators know that the collective female vote is louder and more powerful than that of the richest corporate lobbyists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cancerschmancer.org |title=Welcome |publisher=Cancer Schmancer |date= |accessdate=2016-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} 

She says her goal is to live in a time when women's mortality rates drop as their health care improves and early cancer detection increases.

Her efforts as an outspoken healthcare advocate in Washington DC helped get unanimous passage for {{USBill|109|hr|1245}} (also known as [[Johanna's Law]]) and she is acknowledged in the Congressional Record.

===Politics===
[[File:AmeriDrescher.jpg|thumb|left|Drescher and [[Goli Ameri]]]]
In September 2008, Drescher, a Democrat, was appointed as a U.S. diplomat by George W. Bush Administration's Assistant Secretary of State [[Goli Ameri]]. Her official title was Public Diplomacy Envoy for Women's Health Issues. In traveling throughout the world, she will support U.S. public diplomacy efforts, including working with health organizations and women's groups to raise awareness of women's health issues, cancer awareness and detection, and patient empowerment and advocacy. Her first trip was in late September and included stops in [[Romania]], Hungary, Serbia, and [[Poland]].&lt;ref name="evz"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hungary.usembassy.gov/event_10092008.html|title=U.S. Public Diplomacy Envoy Fran Drescher Raises Awareness of Women's Cancer During Visit to Budapest|accessdate=May 16, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016072313/http://hungary.usembassy.gov/event_10092008.html|archivedate=October 16, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Drescher supported Senator [[Hillary Clinton]] for the Democratic Party presidential nomination. She attended a Super Democrat rally for Clinton. Drescher said that she had been considering a run for the United States Senate in 2008 to succeed [[Hillary Clinton]], but ultimately decided against it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/12/09/ap/national/main4658877.shtml |title='Nanny' state?

===Charity===
In April 2014, Drescher presented at [[Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS]] Easter Bonnet Competition with [[Bryan Cranston]], [[Idina Menzel]] and [[Denzel Washington]], after raising donations at her Broadway show [[Cinderella (2013 Broadway production)|''Cinderella'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.queerty.com/photos-james-franco-idina-menzel-and-fran-drescher-get-into-the-easter-bonnet-competition-20140428 |title=PHOTOS: James Franco, Idina Menzel, and Fran Drescher Get Into the Easter Bonnet Competition / Queerty |website=Queerty.com |date=2014-04-28 |accessdate=2016-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drescher became an ordained minister with the [[Universal Life Church Monastery]] so that she could legally officiate LGBT wedding ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Linda Maxmarch |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/11/fashion/weddings/fran-drescher-strives-to-wed-gay-couples.html |title=Fran Drescher Strives to Wed Gay Couples|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=2012-03-09 |accessdate=2016-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
