He attended Saint Peter's High School (now [[Saint Peter-Marian High School]]), in Worcester and graduated from [[Emerson College]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/lansingstatejournal/access/1805893961.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jul+21%2C+2004&amp;author=Hughes+Mike&amp;pub=Lansing+State+Journal&amp;desc=Leary's+life+colors+new+FX+series&amp;pqatl=google|title=Leary's life colors new FX series|work=Lansing State Journal|location=Lansing, Michigan|date=July 21, 2004|accessdate=August 19, 2011|first=Mike|last=Hughes}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Boston]]. At Emerson, he met fellow comic [[Mario Cantone]], whom to this day Leary considers his closest friend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://connection.emerson.edu/s/1427/social.aspx?sid=1427&amp;gid=1&amp;pgid=1011#ACTPer14|title=Notable Alumni|work=Emerson Connection}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episodes/episode_367_-_gina_gershon Profile], emerson.edu.

After graduating with the Emerson Class of 1981, he took a job at the school teaching comedy writing classes and maintained the job for five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tlchicken.com/view_story.php?ARTid=268|title=Denis Leary|first=Wayne|last=Chinsang|date=June 2001|publisher=Tastes Like Chicken|accessdate=October 22, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received an [[honorary doctorate]] and spoke briefly at his alma mater's undergraduate commencement ceremony on May 16, 2005;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2005-05-26-graduation-speeches_x.htm|title=They came, they saw, they addressed the graduating class|first=César G.|last=Soriano|date=May 26, 2005|work=USA Today|accessdate=October 22, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; he is thus credited as ''Dr. Denis Leary'' on the cover of his 2009 book, ''[[Why We Suck]]''.

==Career==
Leary began working as a comedian in the Boston comedy scene of the 1980s at the underground club, Play It Again Sam's; however, his first real gig was at the Rascals Comedy Club as part of the TV show, ''The Rascals Comedy Hour'', on October 18, 1990. He wrote and appeared on a local comedy series, ''[[The Late, Late Show]]'', hosted by his friend, [[Lenny Clarke]], and written by writer, [[Martin Olson]]. Leary and Clarke both spoke about their early affiliations and influences in the Boston comedy scene in the documentary film, ''[[When Standup Stood Out]]'' (2006), and during this time, he developed his stage persona. He appeared in skits on the [[MTV]] game show ''[[Remote Control (game show)|Remote Control]]'', playing such characters as [[Keith Richards]] of the [[Rolling Stones]], the brother of co-host [[Colin Quinn]], and artist [[Andy Warhol]]. {{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Leary earned fame when he ranted about [[R.E.M.]] in an early 1990s MTV [[sketch comedy|sketch]]. Several other commercials for MTV quickly followed, in which Leary would rant at high speeds about a variety of topics, playing off the then-popular and growing [[Alternative rock|alternative scene]]. One of these rants serves as an introduction to the video of "Shamrocks and Shenanigans (Boom Shalock Lock Boom)" by [[House of Pain]]. He released two [[album (Music)|records]] of his [[stand-up comedy]]: ''[[No Cure for Cancer]]'' (1993) and ''[[Lock 'n Load (album)|Lock 'n Load]]'' (1997). In late 2004, he released the [[extended play|EP]] ''[[Merry Fuckin' Christmas|Merry F#%$in' Christmas]]'', which included a mix of new music, previously unreleased recordings, and some tracks from ''Lock 'n Load''. {{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

In 1993, his [[sarcasm|sardonic]] song about the stereotypical American male, "[[Asshole (song)|Asshole]]", achieved much notoriety; however, this bit was allegedly stolen from [[Louis C.K.]], discussed by Louis on an interview on the [[Opie and Anthony Show]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwhxqnCyoGo YouTube: Louis CK on 'Asshole'] (On a later episode of the same show, Leary challenged Louis CK's assertion by claiming that he (Leary) co-wrote the song with Chris Phillips.)&lt;/ref&gt; It was voted No. 1 in an [[Australia]]n youth radio poll (the [[Triple J Hottest 100]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/hottest100_08/history/1993.htm|title=TripleJ Hottest 100-1993|publisher=ABC Radio|location=Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song was used as part of the [[Holsten Brewery|Holsten Pils]] series of ads in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], in which Leary was participating, with adapted lyrics criticizing a drunk driver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkz12OslGhU|title=Denis Leary: 'He's An Asshole' – Anti-Drink Driving Campaign|via=YouTube|date=January 18, 2008|accessdate=August 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The single was a minor hit there, peaking at No. 58 in the [[UK Singles Chart]] in January 1996.&lt;ref name="British Hit Singles &amp; Albums"&gt;{{cite book|first=David|last=Roberts|year=2006|title=[[British Hit Singles &amp; Albums]]|edition=19th|publisher=Guinness World Records Ltd|location=London, UK|isbn=1-904994-10-5|page=315}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leary has appeared in more than 40 films, including: ''[[The Sandlot]]'' as Scott's stepfather Bill, ''[[Monument Ave.]]'', ''[[The Matchmaker (1997 film)|The Matchmaker]]'', ''[[The Ref]]'', ''[[Draft Day]]'', ''[[Suicide Kings]]'', ''[[Dawg (film)|Dawg]]'', ''[[Wag the Dog]]'', ''[[Demolition Man (film)|Demolition Man]]'', ''[[Judgment Night (film)|Judgment Night]]'', ''[[The Thomas Crown Affair (1999 film)|The Thomas Crown Affair]]'', and ''[[Operation Dumbo Drop]]''. He had a tiny part in [[Oliver Stone]]'s ''[[Natural Born Killers]]'' that was eventually cut. He held the lead role in two television series, ''[[The Job (2001 TV series)|The Job]]'' and ''[[Rescue Me (U.S. TV series)|Rescue Me]]'', and he co-created the latter, in which he played [[Tommy Gavin]], a [[New York City]] firefighter dealing with [[alcoholism]], family dysfunction and other issues in post-[[September 11 attacks|9/11]] New York City.

He received [[Emmy Award]] nominations in 2006 and 2007 for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series for ''Rescue Me'', and in 2008 for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie for the HBO movie ''[[Recount (film)|Recount]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/denis-leary|title=Denis Leary|publisher=Emmys.com|accessdate=December 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leary was offered the role of Dignam in ''[[The Departed]]'' (2006) but turned it down due to scheduling conflicts with ''Rescue Me''. He provided voices for characters in animated films, such as a fire-breathing dragon named Flame in the series ''The Agents'', a pugnacious ladybug named [[List of A Bug's Life characters#Francis|Francis]] in ''[[A Bug's Life]]'' and a prehistoric saber-toothed tiger named [[List of Ice Age characters#Diego|Diego]] in the ''[[Ice Age (franchise)|Ice Age]]'' film series. He has [[film producer|produced]] numerous movies, television shows, and specials through his production company, Apostle; these include [[Comedy Central]]'s ''[[Shorties Watchin' Shorties]]'', the stand-up special ''Denis Leary's Merry F#$%in' Christmas'', and the movie ''[[Blow (film)|Blow]]''. {{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

As a [[Boston Red Sox]] fan, he narrated the official [[2004 World Series]] film (Q Video/MLB Productions, 2004). In 2006, Leary and [[Lenny Clarke]] appeared on television during a Red Sox telecast and, upon realizing that Red Sox first baseman [[Kevin Youkilis]] is Jewish, delivered a criticism of [[Mel Gibson]]'s antisemitic comments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thetrack.bostonherald.com/moreTrack/view.bg?articleid=153220|title=Leary &amp; Clarke a big hit in Sox' out-of-control booth|last1=Fee|first1=Gayle|last2=Raposa|first2=Laura|date=August 17, 2006|work=[[Boston Herald]]|accessdate=October 22, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070826141119/http://thetrack.bostonherald.com/moreTrack/view.bg?articleid=153220|archivedate=August 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an [[ice hockey]] fan, Leary hosted the [[National Hockey League]] video ''NHL's Greatest Goals''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NHL's greatest goals|url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/66288538|website=WorldCat|accessdate=January 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, he was the subject of the ''[[Comedy Central Roast]] of Denis Leary''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/leary_roast/index.jhtml|title=The Comedy Central Roast of Denis Leary Official Site – Watch Denis Leary in the Hot Seat!|publisher=Comedy Central|accessdate=January 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leary did the TV voiceover for [[MLB 2K8]] advertisements, where he used his trademark rant style in baseball terms, and ads for the 2009 [[Ford F-150]] pickup truck.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} He has also appeared in commercials for [[Hulu]] and [[DirecTV]]'s [[NFL Sunday Ticket]] package.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Leary was a producer of the [[Fox Broadcasting]] series ''[[Canterbury's Law]]'', and wrote and directed its pilot episode. ''Canterbury's Law'' aired in the spring of 2008 and was canceled after eight episodes. On September 9, 2008, Leary hosted the sixth annual ''[[Fashion Rocks]]'' event, which aired on [[CBS]]. In December of the year, he appeared in a video on [[funnyordie.com]] critiquing a list of some of his "best" films, titled "Denis Leary Remembers Denis Leary Movies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/6fc5cf60e3|title=Denis Leary Remembers Denis Leary Movies|publisher=Funny or Die|date=December 15, 2008|accessdate=September 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2008, Leary voiced a guest role as himself on the "[[Lost Verizon]]" episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]''.

On March 21, 2009, he began the "Rescue Me Comedy Tour" in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]].

Leary is an [[ice hockey]] fan, and has his own backyard hockey rink at his home in [[Roxbury, Connecticut]], with piping installed under the ice surface to help the ice stay frozen.&lt;ref name="espnbuccigross"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=ESPN|last=Buccigross|first=John|title=It's a mad, mad world (and backyard) for us puckheads|date=January 30, 2007|accessdate=December 1, 2012|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/columns/story?columnist=buccigross_john&amp;id=2747167}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a fan of the [[Boston Bruins]] and the [[Boston Red Sox]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.extremesportclips.com/video/1644/Denis-Leary-Rags-on-Mel-Gibson.html|title=Denis Leary Rags on Mel Gibson – View Video|publisher=Extreme Sport Clips|date=August 12, 2007|accessdate=August 19, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070603074601/http://www.extremesportclips.com/video/1644/Denis-Leary-Rags-on-Mel-Gibson.html|archivedate=June 3, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [[Green Bay Packers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bing.com/videos/watch/video/learys-lowdown-on-boston-sports/12s6e3zb|title=Leary's lowdown on Boston sports|publisher=Bing.com|accessdate=August 19, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121110003926/http://www.bing.com/videos/watch/video/learys-lowdown-on-boston-sports/12s6e3zb|archivedate=November 10, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://incontention.com/2009/07/03/interview-20-questions-with-denis-leary|title=INTERVIEW: 20 questions with Denis Leary|publisher=Incontention.com|date=July 3, 2009|accessdate=August 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leary describes himself as a "[[John F. Kennedy|Jack Kennedy]] [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]]" with some [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] ideologies, including support for the military. Leary told [[Glenn Beck]], "I was a life-long Democrat, but now at my age, I've come to realize that the Democrats suck, and the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] suck, and basically the entire system sucks. But you have to go within the system to find what you want."&lt;ref name=beck&gt;{{cite news|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0707/04/gb.01.html|title=Honest Questions with Denis Leary|publisher=CNN|date=July 4, 2007|accessdate=April 26, 2010|first=Glenn|last=Beck}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leary has said of his religious beliefs, "I'm a [[lapsed Catholic]] in the best sense of the word. You know, I was raised with Irish parents, Irish immigrant parents. My parents, you know, prayed all the time, took us to Mass. And my father would sometimes swear in [[Irish language|Gaelic]]. It doesn't get more religious than that. But, no, after a while, they taught us wrong. I didn't raise my kids with the fear of God. I raised my kids with the sense of, you know, to me, Jesus was this great guy...."&lt;ref name=beck/&gt;

==Leary Firefighters Foundation==
{{Main|Leary Firefighters Foundation}}
On December 3, 1999, six [[firefighter]]s from Leary's hometown of Worcester were killed in the [[Worcester Cold Storage Warehouse fire]]. Among the dead were Leary's cousin Jerry Lucey and his close childhood friend Lt. Tommy Spencer.&lt;ref name="smokeinterview"/&gt; In response, the comedian founded the [[Leary Firefighters Foundation]]. Since its creation in the year 2000, the foundation has distributed over $2.5&amp;nbsp;million ([[United States dollar|USD]]) to fire departments in the Worcester, Boston, and [[New York City]] areas for equipment, training materials, new vehicles, and new facilities. Leary won $125,000 for the foundation on the game show ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire (US game show)#Special editions|Who Wants to Be a Millionaire]]''. Leary has close ties with 107.3/[[WAAF (FM)|WAAF]], which in 2000 released the station album ''Survive This!'' Part of the proceeds from this album were donated to the Leary Firefighters Foundation. {{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

A separate fund run by Leary's foundation, the Fund for New York's Bravest, has distributed over $2&amp;nbsp;million to the families of the 343 firemen killed in the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001 in addition to providing funding for necessities such as a new mobile command center, first responder training, and a high-rise simulator for the [[New York City Fire Department]]'s training campus. As the foundation's president, Leary has been active in all of the fundraising. In the aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]] in New Orleans, Leary donated over a dozen boats to the [[New Orleans Fire Department]] to aid in rescue efforts in future disasters. The foundation also rebuilt entire NOLA firehouses. {{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

==Controversies==
===Plagiarism===
For many years, Leary had been friends with fellow comedian [[Bill Hicks]]. When Leary's comedy album ''No Cure for Cancer'' was released, Leary was accused of stealing Hicks's act and material. The friendship ended abruptly as a result.&lt;ref name="evolutionBook"&gt;{{cite book|title=Bill Hicks: Agent of Evolution|last1=Booth|first1=Kevin|last2=Bertin|first2=Michael|year=2005|publisher=Harper Collins|isbn=0-00-719829-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1993, the ''Austin Comedy News'' remarked on the similarities of Leary's performance, "Watching Leary is like seeing Hicks from two years ago. He [[Tobacco smoking|smokes]] with the same mannerisms. (Hicks recently quit.) He sports the same attitude, the same clothes. He touches on almost all of the same themes. Leary even invokes [[Jim Fixx]]." When asked about this, Hicks told the magazine, "I have a scoop for you. I stole his [Leary's] act. I camouflaged it with punchlines, and to really throw people off, I did it before he did".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gavinsblog.com/probill.htm|title=Profile: Bill Hicks|first=Doug|last=Stern|date=April 1993|work=Austin Comedy News|accessdate=October 22, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At least three stand-up comedians have gone on the record stating they believe Leary stole Hicks' material, comedic persona and attitude.&lt;ref name="evolutionBook"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.joerogan.net/archives/92|title=Carlos Mencia is a weak minded joke thief|first=Joe|last=Rogan|publisher=JoeRogan.net|date=September 27, 2005|accessdate=December 21, 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607224107/http://blog.joerogan.net/archives/92|archivedate=June 7, 2007|df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hicksfaq"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billhicks.com/darktimes/other/darktimes20/faq/faq.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060320081614/http://www.billhicks.com/darktimes/other/darktimes20/faq/faq.html|title=Dark Times: Bill Hicks: Frequently Asked Questions|first=Tim|last=McIntire|year=1998|publisher=BillHicks.com|archivedate=March 20, 2006|accessdate=October 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; One similar routine was about the band [[Judas Priest]], during which Hicks says, "I don't think we lost a cancer cure."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|people=Hicks, Bill|year=1989|title=Sane Man|medium=Stand-up comedy|location=USA|publisher=Roadrunner Records}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Leary's 2003 [[Comedy Central Roast]], comedian [[Lenny Clarke]], a friend of Leary's, said there was a carton of [[cigarette]]s backstage from Bill Hicks with the message, "Wish I had gotten these to you sooner." This joke was cut from the final broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ziano III|first=Nick A.|title=Roasting a comic, they turn up the flames, gently|work=Boston Globe|url=http://www.boston.com/dailyglobe2/222/living/Roasting_a_comic_they_turn_up_the_flames_gently+.shtml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030811054820/http://www.boston.com/dailyglobe2/222/living/Roasting_a_comic_they_turn_up_the_flames_gently+.shtml|archivedate=August 11, 2003|date=August 10, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The feud is also mentioned in [[Cynthia True]]'s biography ''American Scream: The Bill Hicks Story'':
{{quote|text=Leary was in [[Montreal]] to host the "Nasty Show," at [[Club Soda (Montreal)|Club Soda]], and Colleen was coordinating the talent so she was standing backstage when she heard Leary doing material that sounded incredibly similar to old Hicks riffs, including his perennial [[Jim Fixx]] joke: ("[[Keith Richards]] outlived Jim Fixx, the runner and health nut dude. The plot thickens."). When Leary came offstage, Colleen, more stunned than angry, said, "Hey, you know that's Bill Hicks' material! Do you know that's his material?" Leary stood there, stared at her without saying a word and briskly left the dressing room.&lt;ref name="oouuos"&gt;{{cite book|title=American Scream: The Bill Hicks Story|first=Cynthia|last=True|year=2002|publisher=Harper Paperbacks|isbn=0-380-80377-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to the book, True said upon hearing a tape of Leary's album ''No Cure for Cancer'', "Bill was furious. All these years, aside from the occasional jibe, he had pretty much shrugged off Leary's lifting. Comedians borrowed, stole stuff and even bought bits from one another. [[Milton Berle]] and [[Robin Williams]] were famous for it. This was different. Leary had, practically line for line, taken huge chunks of Bill's act and ''recorded'' it."&lt;ref name="oouuos"/&gt;

In a 2008 appearance on ''[[The Opie and Anthony Show]]'', comedian [[Louis CK]] claimed that Leary stole his "I'm an asshole" routine, which was then expanded upon and turned into a hit song by Leary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwhxqnCyoGo|title=Denis Leary ripped off "I'm An Asshole" from Louis CK|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; On a later episode of the same show, Leary challenged this assertion by claiming to have co-written the song with Chris Phillips.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g81LCwrU-7k&amp;feature=related|title=Denis Leary responds to Louis CK claiming he stole "I'm An Asshole" from him|work=Opie &amp; Anthony Show|date=November 18, 2008|accessdate=December 1, 2012|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Autism===
In his 2008 book ''[[Why We Suck|Why We Suck: A Feel Good Guide to Staying Fat, Loud, Lazy and Stupid]]'', Leary wrote:{{quote|There is a huge boom in [[Autism spectrum disorder|autism]] right now because inattentive mothers and competitive dads want an explanation for why their dumb-ass kids can't compete academically, so they throw money into the happy laps of [[Psychiatrist|shrinks]]... to get back diagnoses that help explain away the deficiencies of their junior morons. I don't [care] what these crackerjack whack jobs tell you – your kid is not autistic. He's just stupid. Or lazy. Or both.}}

In response to the controversy, Leary stated that the quote was taken out of context and that in that paragraph he had been talking about the trend of unwarranted over-diagnosis of autism, which he attributed to American parents seeking an excuse for behavioral problems and under-performance. Later, he apologized to parents with autistic children whom he had offended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usmagazine.com/news/denis-leary-says-autism-Criticism-taken-out-of-context|title=Denis Leary Says Autism Criticism Taken 'Out of Context'|date=October 16, 2008|work=Us Weekly|accessdate=May 22, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081018134220/http://www.usmagazine.com/news/denis-leary-says-autism-Criticism-taken-out-of-context|archivedate=October 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bostonherald.com/news/regional/view/2008_10_28_Denis_Leary_Tells_Parents:_I_m_Sorry:_%E2%80%98Raising_Children_With_Autism__Deserves_Admiration__Comic_Says/srvc=home&amp;position=0|title=Denis Leary Tells Parents: I'm Sorry|first=Laurel J.|last=Sweet|date=October 28, 2008|work=Boston Herald|accessdate=May 22, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110203105558/http://news.bostonherald.com/news/regional/view/2008_10_28_Denis_Leary_Tells_Parents%3A_I_m_Sorry%3A_%E2%80%98Raising_Children_With_Autism__Deserves_Admiration__Comic_Says/srvc%3Dhome%26position%3D0|archivedate=February 3, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
