'''Rhona Cameron''' (born 27 September 1965) is a Scottish [[comedian]]. She rose to prominence via the stand-up comedy circuit, and was a regular on British television in the 1990s.

==Television career==

In 1992, she won ''[[So You Think You're Funny]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Rhona Cameron – 1992 {{!}} So You Think You're Funny?|url = http://soyouthinkyourfunny.co.uk/past-winners/winners/rhona-cameron-1992|website = soyouthinkyourfunny.co.uk|accessdate = 2015-08-03|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111020002152/http://soyouthinkyourfunny.co.uk/past-winners/winners/rhona-cameron-1992|archivedate = 20 October 2011|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She presented the [[ITV Network|ITV]] game show ''Russian Roulette'' and the [[BBC Two]] show ''[[Gaytime TV]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/628112 BFI database: GAYTIME TV &amp;#91;08/06/99&amp;#93;]&lt;/ref&gt; Cameron co-wrote ''[[Rhona (TV series)|Rhona]]'' with her former partner Linda Gibson. ''Rhona'' was a [[sitcom]] which starred Cameron as Rhona Campbell, a lesbian Scot living alone in London, who has problems similar to those of her straight friends. Only one six episode series was made, broadcast in July and August 2000 on [[BBC2]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/rhona/ |title=Rhona |work=BBC Comedy |publisher=BBC |accessdate=1 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0254043/episodes |title=Episode list for "Rhona" (2000) |work=The Internet Movie Database |publisher=IMDb.com |accessdate=1 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cameron was a participant in the first series of ''[[I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! (UK TV series)|I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!]]''. She was responsible for one of the highlights of the show, when the tensions in the camp became unbearable for her, she ranted:
{{quote|Sometimes I'm patronising. Sometimes I'm sarcastic. Sometimes he's ([[Nigel Benn]]) hot-headed. Sometimes [[Nell McAndrew|Nell]] says nothing. Sometimes [[Uri Geller|Uri]] dramatises little things like farts like he's an alien who's never seen one before. Sometimes [[Tony Blackburn|Tony]] misses things because he's slightly slower. Sometimes [[Tara Palmer Tompkinson|Tara]] is like a child who's never been able to make a cup of tea. Sometimes, sometimes we are all like that, OK? That's life, that's personalities.}}

In June 2009, she appeared on ''[[Wife Swap (UK TV series)|Celebrity Wife Swap]]'' with her partner, [[Suran Dickson]].&lt;ref&gt;

==Writing==
