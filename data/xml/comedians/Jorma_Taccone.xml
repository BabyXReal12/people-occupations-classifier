In Fall 2005, Samberg, Taccone, and Schaffer joined the staff of NBC's late night variety show ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. Since then, The Lonely Island has been responsible for creating more than 100 [[SNL Digital Shorts|SNL Digital Short]] films including the YouTube favorites "[[Lazy Sunday (The Lonely Island song)|Lazy Sunday]]" (featuring [[Chris Parnell]]), "[[Jizz in My Pants]]", "[[I'm on a Boat]]" (featuring [[T-Pain]]) and the [[Emmy]]-winning "[[Dick in a Box]]" (featuring [[Justin Timberlake]]). Taccone produces much of the music for The Lonely Island including Lazy Sunday, "[[Dick in a Box]]" and many other tracks that appear on The Lonely Island's first album ''[[Incredibad]]'' which was released February 2009. As a director, Taccone is responsible for the ''SNL'' shorts [[MacGruber]], Business Meeting, Sloths, Giraffes, and others. He also directed a MacGruber [[Pepsi]] commercial spot for the 43rd [[Super Bowl]] which aired February 1, 2009.

In 2007, Taccone co-starred in Paramount's ''[[Hot Rod (film)|Hot Rod]]'', (starring Andy Samberg, directed by Akiva Schaffer). Taccone is also one of the principal actors in the music video "[[Jizz in My Pants]]". He also plays Guy #2 in "We Like Sportz", reprising the role from "Just 2 Guyz". Taccone played the lead role of Brett in The Lonely Island's ''The ’Bu'', the group's record-breaking contribution to [[Channel 101]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel101.com/ |title=Channel 101—The Unavoidable Future of Entertainment |publisher=Channel101.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he played a ninja who did not belong. ''The ’Bu'', a parody of ''[[The OC]]'', also starred [[Sarah Chalke]] (''[[Roseanne (TV series)|Roseanne]]'', ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]'') as Melissa and [[Andy Samberg]] as Aaron. In the group's first Channel 101 show, "ITV Buzz Countdown", Taccone played Chris Hoffman, a fictional [[VJ (media personality)|VJ]] on a parody of MTV's ''[[Total Request Live]]''.
He made a cameo appearance in ''[[Role Models]]'' as Mitch from Graphics, in which he sings a karaoke version of the [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]]' "[[Rock You Like a Hurricane]]", he co-stars in the [[Gnarls Barkley]] music video for the song "[[Who's Gonna Save My Soul]]".

Taccone appeared as Cha-Ka in Universal's 2009 film ''[[Land of the Lost (film)|Land of the Lost]]'', a role which got him a nomination for the [[Razzie Award]] for [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actor|Worst Supporting Actor]].

In August 2009, he directed his first film, an adaptation of the ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' sketch ''[[MacGruber]]'' and was featured as part of the group male vocals on Lightspeed Champion's album ''Life Is Sweet! Nice to Meet You''. As of ''SNL'''s 36th season, Jorma is no longer cited in the end credits, though he is still listed on the NBC website as a writer and holds the unofficial title of "Sexiest Member of Lonely Island". According to his band's website, thelonelyisland.com, however, "the Dudes" are still responsible for the SNL Digital Shorts. It was later confirmed that Jorma had left ''Saturday Night Live'', though he worked on some shorts in the 36th season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/ |title=AV Club—The Lonely Island |publisher=avclub.com |date=May 24, 2011 |accessdate=2011-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taccone acted in season 5 of MyDamnChannel's ''[[Wainy Days]]'' and is the Director of the AT&amp;T Wireless ''It's Not Complicated'' television advertising campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lbbonline.com/news/bbdo-atlantas-its-not-complicated-for-att/ |title=BBDO ATLANTA'S 'IT'S NOT COMPLICATED' FOR AT&amp;T |publisher=lbbonline.co |date=November 30, 2012 |accessdate=2012-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also had a recurring role on the HBO show ''[[Girls (TV series)|Girls]]'', as the character Booth Jonathan.
