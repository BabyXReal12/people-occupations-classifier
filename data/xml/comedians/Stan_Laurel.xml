'''Stan Laurel''' (born '''Arthur Stanley Jefferson'''; 16 June 1890 – 23 February 1965) was a British [[comedian|comic]] [[actor]], writer and film director, who was part of the comedy duo [[Laurel and Hardy]].&lt;ref name="WVobit"&gt;"Obituary". ''[[Variety Obituaries|Variety]]'', 3 March 1965, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; He appeared with his comedy partner [[Oliver Hardy]] in 107 short films, feature films, and cameo roles.&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt;

Laurel began his career in [[music hall]], where he developed a number of his standard comic devices: the [[bowler hat]], the deep comic gravity and the nonsensical understatement. His performances polished his skills at [[pantomime]] and music hall sketches. Laurel was a member of "[[Fred Karno]]'s Army", where he was [[Charlie Chaplin]]'s [[understudy]].&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McCabe"&gt;McCabe 2005, p. 143. Robson, 2005 Retrieved: 18 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt; With Chaplin, the two arrived in the United States on the same ship from the United Kingdom with the Karno troupe.&lt;ref name="Karno"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/07/the-fine-mess-maker-at-home/|title=The Fine Mess-Maker at Home|website=[[New York Times]]|date=7 September 2012|last=Cavett|first=Dick}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laurel began his film career in 1917 and made his final appearance in 1951. From 1928 onwards, he appeared exclusively with Hardy. Laurel officially retired from the screen following his comedy partner's death in 1957.

In 1961, Laurel was given a Lifetime Achievement [[Academy Award]] for his pioneering work in comedy. He has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 7021 [[Hollywood Blvd]]. Laurel and Hardy ranked top among best double acts and seventh overall in a 2005 UK poll to find the ''Comedians' Comedian''.&lt;ref name="Legacy"/&gt; In 2009, a bronze statue of the duo was unveiled in Laurel's home town of [[Ulverston]].

==Early life==
[[File:Ulverston's most famous son - geograph.org.uk - 151570.jpg|thumb|left|Plaque at Laurel's birthplace in [[Ulverston]]]]
Arthur Stanley Jefferson was born in his grandparents' house on 16 June 1890 in Argyll Street, [[Ulverston]], [[Lancashire]] to Arthur Jefferson, a theatre manager from [[Bishop Auckland]], and Margaret (née Metcalfe), an actress from Ulverston. He was one of five children.&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;Midwinter, Eric. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/37659 "Laurel, Stan".] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography,'' 2006. Retrieved: 20 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

His parents were both active in the theatre and always very busy. In his early years, the boy spent much time living with his maternal grandmother, Sarah Metcalfe.&lt;ref name="McCabe"/&gt; He attended school at [[King James I Academy|King James I Grammar School]] in [[Bishop Auckland]], [[County Durham]]&lt;ref name="The Northern Echo 2012"&gt;{{cite web | title=Stan Laurel's former Bishop Auckland school 'left to rot' | website=[[The Northern Echo]] | date=2012-02-04 | url=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/9512813.Stan_Laurel_s_former_Bishop_Auckland_school__left_to_rot_/ | access-date=2018-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Kings Priory School|King's School]] in [[Tynemouth]], [[Northumberland]].&lt;ref name="The Northern Echo 2014"&gt;{{cite web | title=Stan Laurel letter set to go under the hammer | website=[[The Northern Echo]] | date=2014-09-13 | url=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/local/southdurham/bishopauckland/11471926.Stan_Laurel_letter_set_to_go_under_the_hammer/ | access-date=2018-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Stan Laurel plaque at Britannia Music Hall, Glasgow.jpg|thumb|upright|Stan Laurel plaque, [[Britannia Music Hall]], Glasgow]]
He moved with his parents to [[Glasgow]], Scotland, where he completed his education at [[Stonelaw High School|Rutherglen Academy]]. His father managed Glasgow's [[The Metropole Theatre|Metropole Theatre]], where Laurel began work. His boyhood hero was [[Dan Leno]], one of the greatest English [[music hall]] comedians.&lt;ref name="McCabe"/&gt; With a natural affinity for the theatre, Laurel gave his first professional performance on stage at the [[Britannia Music Hall|Panopticon]] in [[Glasgow]] at the age of sixteen, where he polished his skills at [[pantomime]] and music hall sketches.&lt;ref&gt;Bowers 2007, pp. 143–147.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the music hall from where he drew his standard comic devices, including his [[bowler hat]] and nonsensical understatement.&lt;ref name="McCabe"/&gt;

He joined [[Fred Karno]]'s troupe of actors in 1910 with the stage name of "Stan Jefferson"; the troupe also included a young [[Charlie Chaplin]]. The music hall nurtured him, and he acted as Chaplin's [[understudy]] for some time.&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McCabe"/&gt; Karno was a pioneer of [[slapstick]], and in his biography Laurel stated, "Fred Karno didn't teach Charlie [Chaplin] and me all we know about comedy. He just taught us most of it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Burton|first1=Alan|title=Pimple, pranks &amp; pratfalls: British film comedy before 1930|date=2000|publisher=Flicks Books|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chaplin and Laurel arrived in the United States on the same ship from Britain with the Karno troupe and toured the country.&lt;ref name="Karno"/&gt;
During the [[First World War]], Laurel registered for military service in America on 5 June 1917, as required under the [[Selective Service Act of 1917|Selective Service Act]]. He was not called up; his registration card states [[Alien (law)|resident alien]] and deafness as exemptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lettersfromstan.com/stan-early-01.html|title=Letters From Stan – 1915–1923|first=Bernie|last=Hogya|website=www.lettersfromstan.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebrainydeafsite.com/p3.html|title=P.3|website=TheBrainyDeafSite}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Laurel and Hardy - The Lucky Dog (1921).ogv|thumb|left|Laurel and Hardy appeared for the first time together in ''[[The Lucky Dog]]''.]]
Between 1916 and 1918, he teamed up with Alice Cooke and [[Baldwin Cooke]], who became his lifelong friends. Amongst other performers, Laurel worked briefly alongside [[Oliver Hardy]] before the two were a team in the silent film short ''[[The Lucky Dog]]'' (1921).&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt; It was around this time that Laurel met [[Mae Dahlberg]]. Around the same time, he adopted the stage name of Laurel at Dahlberg's suggestion that his stage name Stan Jefferson was unlucky, due to it having thirteen letters. {{#tag:ref|Laurel disputed this and claimed that it just "sounded good".&lt;ref&gt;McCabe 1961, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=N}} The pair were performing together when Laurel was offered $75 a week to star in two-reel comedies. After making his first film ''[[Nuts in May (film)|Nuts in May]]'', [[Universal Studios|Universal]] offered him a contract. The contract was soon cancelled during a reorganisation at the studio. Among the films in which Dahlberg and Laurel appeared together was the 1922 parody ''[[Mud and Sand]]''.

By 1924, Laurel had given up the stage for full-time film work, under contract with [[Joe Rock]] for 12 two-reel comedies. The contract had one unusual stipulation: that Dahlberg was not to appear in any of the films. Rock thought that her temperament was hindering Laurel's career. In 1925, she started interfering with Laurel's work, so Rock offered her a cash settlement and a one-way ticket back to her native [[Australia]], which she accepted.&lt;ref&gt;Bergan 1992, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; The 12 two-reel comedies were ''[[Mandarin Mix-Up]]'' (1924), ''[[Detained (film)|Detained]]'' (1924), ''[[Monsieur Don't Care]]'' (1924), ''[[West of Hot Dog]]'' (1924), ''[[Somewhere in Wrong]]'' (1925), ''[[Twins (1925 film)|Twins]]'' (1925), ''[[Pie-Eyed]]'' (1925), ''[[The Snow Hawk]]'' (1925), ''[[Navy Blue Days]]'' (1925), ''[[The Sleuth (1925 film)|The Sleuth]]'' (1925), ''[[Dr. Pyckle and Mr. Pryde]]'' (1925), ''[[Half a Man (film)|Half a Man]]'' (1925).

==Laurel and Hardy==
{{Main|Laurel and Hardy}}
[[File:Laurel and Hardy in Lucky Dog.jpg|thumb|left|Laurel with Hardy in ''[[The Lucky Dog (1921 film)|The Lucky Dog]]'' (1921), long before they became a team.]]
Laurel next signed with the [[Hal Roach]] studio, where he began directing films, including a 1926 production called ''[[Yes, Yes, Nanette]]''. He intended to work primarily as a writer and director.

[[Oliver Hardy]], another member of the Hal Roach Studios Comedy ''All Star'' players, was injured in a kitchen mishap in 1927, and Laurel was asked to return to acting. Laurel and Hardy began sharing the screen in ''[[Slipping Wives]]'', ''[[Duck Soup (1927 film)|Duck Soup]]'' (1927), and ''[[With Love and Hisses]]''. The two became friends and their comic chemistry soon became obvious. Roach Studios' supervising director [[Leo McCarey]] noticed the audience reaction to them and began teaming them, leading to the creation of the ''[[Laurel and Hardy]]'' series later that year.

Together, the two men began producing a huge body of short films, including ''[[The Battle of the Century]]'', ''[[Should Married Men Go Home?]]'', ''[[Two Tars]]'', ''[[Be Big!]]'', ''[[Big Business (1929 film)|Big Business]]'', and many others. Laurel and Hardy successfully made the transition to talking films with the short ''[[Unaccustomed As We Are]]'' in 1929. They also appeared in their first feature in one of the revue sequences of ''[[The Hollywood Revue of 1929]],'' and the following year they appeared as the comic relief in the lavish all-colour (in [[Technicolor]]) musical feature ''[[The Rogue Song]]''. Their first starring feature ''[[Pardon Us]]'' was released in 1931. They continued to make both features and shorts until 1935, including their 1932 three-reeler ''[[The Music Box (film)|The Music Box]],'' which won an [[Academy Award for Live Action Short Film|Academy Award for Best Short Subject]].

===Trouble at Roach Studio===
During the 1930s, Laurel was involved in a dispute with Hal Roach which resulted in the termination of his contract. Roach maintained separate contracts for Laurel and Hardy that expired at different times, so Hardy remained at the studio and was "teamed" with [[Harry Langdon]] for the 1939 film ''[[Zenobia (film)|Zenobia]]''. The studio discussed a series of films co-starring Hardy with [[Patsy Kelly]] to be called "The Hardy Family." But Laurel sued Roach over the contract dispute. Eventually, the case was dropped and Laurel returned to Roach. The first film that [[Laurel and Hardy]] made after Laurel returned was ''[[A Chump at Oxford]]''. Subsequently, they made ''[[Saps at Sea]]'', which was their last film for Roach.

===20th Century Fox===
[[File:Stan in color.jpg|thumb|upright|Stan Laurel in still from ''[[The Tree in a Test Tube]]'' (1943), a colour short made for the US Department of Agriculture]]
In 1941, [[Laurel and Hardy]] signed a contract at [[Twentieth Century Fox|20th Century Fox]] to make ten films over five years. During the war years, their work became more standardised and less successful, though ''[[The Bullfighters]]'' and ''[[Jitterbugs]]'' did receive some praise.

In 1947, Laurel returned to England when he and Hardy went on a six-week tour of the United Kingdom, and the duo were mobbed wherever they went. Laurel's homecoming to [[Ulverston]] took place in May, and the duo were greeted by thousands of fans outside the Coronation Hall.&lt;ref name="nwmail"/&gt; The ''[[North-West Evening Mail|Evening Mail]]'' noted: "Oliver Hardy remarked to our reporter that Stan had talked about Ulverston for the past 22 years and he thought he had to see it."&lt;ref name="nwmail"&gt;[http://www.nwemail.co.uk/memories/stan-at-queen-s-first-royal-variety-show-1.1015949 "Stan at Queen's first Royal Variety Show"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201221344/http://www.nwemail.co.uk/memories/stan-at-queen-s-first-royal-variety-show-1.1015949 |date=1 February 2014 }}. North West Evening Mail.&lt;/ref&gt; The tour included a [[Royal Command Performance]] for King [[George VI]] and [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen Elizabeth]] in London.&lt;ref name="nwmail"/&gt; The success of the tour led them to spend the next seven years touring the UK and Europe.

Around this time, Laurel found out that he had diabetes, so he encouraged Hardy to find solo projects which he did, taking parts in John Wayne and Bing Crosby films.

In 1950, Laurel and Hardy were invited to France to make a feature film. The film was a disaster, a Franco-Italian co-production titled ''[[Atoll K]]''. (The film was entitled ''Utopia'' in the US and ''Robinson Crusoeland'' in the UK.) Both stars were noticeably ill during the filming. Upon returning to the United States, they spent most of their time recovering. In 1952, Laurel and Hardy toured Europe successfully, and they returned in 1953 for another tour of the continent. During this tour, Laurel fell ill and was unable to perform for several weeks.&lt;ref&gt;Bergen 1992, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1954, Hardy had a heart attack and cancelled the tour. In 1955, they were planning to do a television series called ''Laurel and Hardy's Fabulous Fables'' based on children's stories. The plans were delayed after Laurel suffered a [[stroke]] on 25 April 1955, from which he recovered. But as the team was planning to get back to work, his partner Hardy had a massive [[stroke]] on 14 September 1956, which resulted in his being unable to return to acting.

===Hardy's death===
Oliver Hardy died on 7 August 1957. Laurel was too ill to attend his funeral and said, "Babe would understand".&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;Rawlngs, Nate. [http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2005073_2005072_2005121,00.html "Top 10 Across-the-Pond Duos"], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', 20 July 2010. Retrieved: 18 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; People who knew Laurel said that he was devastated by Hardy's death and never fully recovered from it. He refused to perform on stage or act in another film without his friend,&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt; although he continued to socialise with his fans.

==After Laurel and Hardy==
In 1961, Stan Laurel was given a Lifetime Achievement Academy Award for his pioneering work in comedy. He had achieved his lifelong dream as a comedian and had been involved in nearly 190 films. He lived his final years in a small flat in the Oceana Apartments in [[Santa Monica, California]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lettersfromstan.com/stan_oceana.html "Latter."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120228174300/http://www.lettersfromstan.com/stan_oceana.html |date=28 February 2012 }} ''The Stan Laurel Correspondence Archive Project''.

Laurel was always gracious to fans and spent much time answering fan mail.

[[Jerry Lewis]] was among the numerous comedians to visit Laurel, who offered suggestions for Lewis's production of ''[[The Bellboy]]'' (1960). Lewis paid tribute to Laurel by naming his main character Stanley in the film, and having [[Bill Richmond (writer)|Bill Richmond]] play a version of Laurel as well.&lt;ref&gt;Brody, Richard.

Retrieved 17 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dick Van Dyke]] told a similar story. When he was just starting his career, he looked up Laurel's phone number, called him, and then visited him at his home. Van Dyke played Laurel on "The Sam Pomerantz Scandals" episode of ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]''.

Laurel was offered a cameo role in ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' (1963), but turned it down. He did not want to be on screen in his old age,&lt;ref name="Karno"/&gt; especially without Hardy.

==Personal life==
Laurel and Mae Charlotte Dahlberg never married, but lived together as [[Common-law marriage|common-law husband and wife]] from 1919 to 1925, before Dahlberg accepted a one-way ticket from [[Joe Rock]] to go back to her native Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Louvish, ''Stan and Ollie, The Roots of Comedy'', Faber &amp; Faber 2001 {{ISBN|0-571-21590-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1937, Dahlberg was back in the USA and sued the now successful Stan Laurel for financial support. At the time, Laurel's second marriage was in the process of a divorce, with Dahlberg's legal suit adding to Laurel's woes. The matter was settled out of court.&lt;ref&gt;[https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=SBS19371207.1.4 ''San Bernardino Sun'', Volume 44, 7 December 1937, Page 4, "Stan Laurels in Agreement"] Accessed 2017-4-15&lt;/ref&gt; Dahlberg was described as a "relief project worker" by the court.

Laurel had four wives and married one of them a second time after their divorce.&lt;ref name="latimes.com"&gt;Harnisch, Larry. [http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-then21-2009jun21,0,3596284.story?track=rss "Stan Laurel's stormy marriage full of off-screen drama."] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', 21 June 2009. Retrieved: 20 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Laurel married his first wife, [[Lois Neilson]], on 13 August 1926. On 10 December 1927, during the early years of Laurel and Hardy's partnership, Laurel and Neilson had a baby daughter, also named Lois. In May 1930, their second child, a son named Stanley, was born two months premature and died after nine days. Stan's daughter Lois died on 27 July 2017, aged 89.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/lois-laurel-hawes-dead-stan-laurels-daughter-was-89-1025214 Lois Laurel Hawes, Daughter of Stan Laurel, Dies at 89]&lt;/ref&gt; Laurel and Neilson divorced in December 1934.

In 1935, Laurel married Virginia Ruth Rogers (known as Ruth). In 1937, Laurel filed for divorce from Ruth, confessing that he was not over his ex-wife Lois, but Lois decided against a reconciliation. On New Year's Day 1938, Laurel married Vera Ivanova Shuvalova (known as Illeana), leading to an irate Ruth accusing Stan of [[bigamy]], but their divorce had been finalised a couple of days before his new marriage. The new marriage was very volatile. Illeana accused him of trying to bury her alive in the backyard of their San Fernando Valley home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harnisch|first1=Larry|title=Stormy marriage full of off-screen drama for Stan Laurel|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/jun/21/local/me-then21|accessdate=14 April 2018|agency=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=21 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He and Illeana separated in 1939 and divorced in 1940, with Illeana surrendering all claim to the Laurel surname on 1 February 1940, in exchange for $6,500.&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, "Surrenders Her Name", ''The Spokesman-Review'', Spokane, Washington, Friday 2 February 1940, Volume 57, Number 264, page 2.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1941, Laurel remarried Virginia Ruth Rogers, with Laurel and Ruth divorcing for the second time in early 1946.&lt;ref name="latimes.com"/&gt;
