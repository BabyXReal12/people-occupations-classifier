'''Shane Lee Yaw''' (born July 19, 1988), known professionally as '''Shane Dawson''', is an American [[YouTuber]], author, sketch comedian, actor, film director, and musician. He was one of the first people to rise to fame on [[Online video platform|video-sharing]] website [[YouTube]], and has since maintained an online presence.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tubefilter.com/2018/06/27/shane-dawson-helping-youtube-stars-longevity/ After Unlocking The Key To Longevity, Shane Dawson Is Helping Fellow YouTube OGs Do The Same]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, when Dawson was nineteen years old, he signed up for YouTube and began making videos. He rose to fame on the site, garnering over half a billion views by 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Meet-The-YouTube-Stars-Making-More-Money-Than-2385054.php Meet The YouTube Stars Making More Money Than EMTs, Cops, Firefighters, And Teachers]&lt;/ref&gt; Most of his early work consisted of [[sketch comedy]] videos, where Dawson would play original characters, impersonate celebrities and make light of [[popular culture]]. During this time, Dawson also had a short-lived music career, releasing 6 original songs such as "[[Superluv!]]" and numerous [[Parody|parodies]] of popular music videos. In 2013—inspired by [[Howard Stern]]—Dawson launched his podcast, [[Shane and Friends]], which ran for four years and produced 140 episodes. The following year, Dawson released his first and only feature film, ''[[Not Cool (film)|Not Cool]]'', and appeared on an accompanying 10-episode [[Television documentary|docu-series]] ''The Chair''.{{refn|&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bustle.com/articles/41633-youtube-star-shane-dawson-apologizes-for-racist-videos-im-not-buying-it-video YouTube Star Shane Dawson Apologizes for Racist Videos &amp; I'm Not Buying It — VIDEO]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/shane-dawson/397945105 Shane Dawson on Apple Music]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://qz.com/436482/shane-dawson-the-most-popular-successful-comedian-youve-never-heard-of/ Shane Dawson: The most popular, successful, comedian you’ve never heard of]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://variety.com/2017/digital/news/fullscreen-svod-shutdown-layoffs-1202614100/ Fullscreen Shutting Down Subscription VOD Service, Will Lay Off 25 Employees]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/The-Chair-Season-1/dp/B00OPX6JKI Amazon.com: The Chair, Season 1: Shane Dawson, Anna Martemucci]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 2015, Dawson began his conspiracy show on YouTube, a [[Television show|video series]] where he discusses a variety of [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]]. They have become some of his most-viewed videos.{{refn|&lt;ref&gt;[http://popcrush.com/shane-dawson-disney-conspiracies-video/ Shane Dawson Talks Disney Conspiracies [VIDEO]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://filmschoolrejects.com/shane-dawson-tanacon-series/ Why Shane Dawson's 'TanaCon' Series is So Gripping]&lt;/ref&gt;}} In late 2017, Dawson released his first docu-series on YouTube, in which he reconciled with his abusive father. He began using the format regularly in 2018, with ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' describing it as a "new era of entertainment." His most-viewed docu-series are about [[Jeffree Star]] and Tanacon.{{refn|&lt;ref&gt;[https://studybreaks.com/culture/shane-dawson/ Shane Dawson Proves Authenticity Still Exists On YouTube]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.polygon.com/2018/8/3/17642862/shane-dawson-jeffree-star-documentary-keeping-up-kardashians Shane Dawson’s new documentaries crack YouTube culture’s Kardashian problem]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As of 2018, Dawson has released two ''[[New York Times]]'' best-selling books, ''[[I Hate Myselfie]]'' and ''[[It Gets Worse: A Collection of Essays|It Gets Worse]]'', and his three YouTube channels have accumulated over 5 billion views.{{refn|&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=shane |url=https://www.youtube.com/user/shane/about |website=YouTube |accessdate=5 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ShaneDawsonTV |url=https://www.youtube.com/user/ShaneDawsonTV/about |website=YouTube |accessdate=5 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ShaneDawsonTV2 |url=https://www.youtube.com/user/ShaneDawsonTV2/about |website=YouTube |accessdate=5 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Since 2017, he maintains one active channel, ''shane'', which is one of the 100 [[List of most-subscribed YouTube channels|most-subscribed YouTube channels]] with 16 million subscribers and over 4 billion views.

==Life and career==

===1988–2007: Early life===
Dawson grew up in [[Long Beach, California]], where he attended [[Lakewood High School (California)|Lakewood High School]]. As a teenager, he was overweight and was mentally and physically abused by his alcoholic father, who eventually abandoned his family. He has two other older biological brothers, Jerid and Jacob Yaw. The siblings had a close relationship, and helped Dawson during these times. Additionally, his family was poor and he was often bullied for this. He has since lost {{convert|150|lb}}. He first became interested in making videos when he would turn in videos as school projects with his friends in high school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dawson|first=Shane|title=BORN THIS WAY in LONG BEACH!meow|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NyjCnLwji4&amp;feature=channel_video_title|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=March 6, 2011|date=March 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DRAW MY LIFE - Shane Dawson|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-F72tFju90|website=YouTube|accessdate=November 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2008–10: YouTube channels===
On March 10, 2008, Dawson made his YouTube channel, called "ShaneDawsonTV". The earliest video that remains on the channel, "Hodini's Street Magic" was uploaded three months later. When he first began making videos, he worked at [[Jenny Craig, Inc.|Jenny Craig]] along with his mother and brother, but was fired in August 2008 after he uploaded a video of himself [[pole dancing]] in the building he worked in. His mother, brother and about six other coworkers who appeared in the video also got fired after the company saw the video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ferguson |first=Wes |url=http://www.celebuzz.com/2012-04-13/shane-dawson-reveals-downside-to-internet-fame/ |title=Shane Dawson Reveals Downside to Internet Fame |date=April 13, 2012 |publisher=celebuzz |accessdate=February 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September, he uploaded a video called "[[Fred Figglehorn|Fred]] is Dead!", which has since received over 24 million views (as of September 2016), making it his most-viewed video to date.
Dawson occasionally posts new videos on his channel "ShaneDawsonTV" (mainly short [[web films]], music video parodies, film trailer parodies, and original music) and formerly posted other videos on his second channel "ShaneDawsonTV2", now called "Human Emoji" however the use of this channel has mostly been discontinued as of 2012. His third YouTube channel, [https://www.youtube.com/shane Shane], is where he previously posted [[vlogs]], and now posts original content Mondays through Fridays. He began using this channel in May 2010. Shane often collaborates with other [[List of YouTube personalities|YouTubers]] or appears in their videos, such as [[Joseph Graceffa|Joey Graceffa]], BrittaniLouiseTaylor, [[TheFineBros]], [[Trisha Paytas]], [[iJustine]] (real name Justine Ezarik), [[Tyler Oakley]], [[Miranda Sings]] (a character created by YouTuber, comedian, singer and actress [[Colleen Ballinger]]), Sawyer Hartman, Drew Monson and others. In November 2009, Dawson was featured on ''[[Attack of the Show!]]''.&lt;ref name="g4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://g4tv.com/attackoftheshow/whoswhoonyoutube/66741/Shane-Dawsons-Comedy-Sketches-on-YouTube.html|title=Shane Dawson's Comedy Sketches on YouTube|last=Dalonzo|first=Michael |date=November 5, 2009|work=Attack of the Show!|publisher=G4|accessdate=April 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Forbes magazine named him their 25th most famous web celebrity.&lt;ref name="forbes"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/2010/02/02/web-celebrities-internet-thought-leaders-2010.html|title=The Web Celeb 25|last=Ewalt|first=David M. |date=February 2, 2010|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=April 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010–13: Television pilots and music career===
On August 11, 2010, Dawson announced that he was in the making of a 30-minute [[Television pilot|pilot]] which he will call ''SD High''. Previously, the funding he needed for the pilot was provided by digital media group [[Take180]] after he helped them out with acting in their own videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rqvxqu049AY |title=WIZARDS OF SD HIGH?! |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=November 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pilot is based on two previous videos which Dawson uploaded to his main channel in Summer 2010. In his previous videos, the story centers around a teenage boy in school, and his interactions with the other characters. The pilot was due to be released towards the end of September 2010 on his main YouTube Channel, however Dawson later announced that he had been contacted by a television studio to produce the pilot for their TV channel(s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoV-lDDHNn0 |title=Taylor Lautner In My Room?! |author=Shane Dawson |date=September 15, 2010 |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=September 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Dawson, there is some uncertainty involving the pilot, however it may be a TV show in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=iv&amp;annotation_id=annotation_798357&amp;v=0vlHLPwlV2o |title=SHANE DAWSON in the YouTube Spotlight |author=stirfryTV |date=September 25, 2010 |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=September 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 26, 2011, Dawson uploaded a video to YouTube explaining to his audience that he's working with [[Happy Madison Productions]], [[Sony Pictures]], and some other YouTubers including TheFineBros and BrittaniLouiseTaylor to create the television show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqFOTUoWpzQ |title=Teens Gone Wild in "SD High"!  |author=ShaneDawsonTV |date=March 26, 2011 |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=March 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2012, Dawson stated in a video that he was now working on a new television show, which would be semi-based on his life working at a Weight Loss center. He stated that he would be pitching the show soon, and that he was "really excited" for it, and stated the show was "kind of like ''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]]'', but – not."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/shane#p/u/0/Rap7P_FwTxs |title=shane |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=September 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 16, 2012, Dawson revealed in a [[vlog]] that he was working on a comedy-horror film, explaining that he wanted to write "something like a teen comedy", however that the film would be "scary and fun". Dawson revealed in November 2012 that he was in negotiations to direct a feature-length film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLCRCAimdcU&amp;feature=channel&amp;list=UL |title=SUPER SWEET 16 *SPOOF*! |publisher=YouTube |date=November 17, 2012 |accessdate=September 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Dawson revealed in a [[vlog]] that he was working on a music project. In March 2012, Dawson revealed that his debut mainstream single, "[[SUPERLUV!]]" would be released that month. The song was released on March 31, 2012 on [[iTunes]], with an accompanying music video debuting on his YouTube channel on the same day. The song managed to chart at 87 in [[Ireland]], 16 on the [[UK Indie Chart]], 163 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] and reached the 28th spot on the US [[iTunes]] Pop Chart.

On May 8, 2012, Dawson revealed in a video that he has begun working on his next original song, which is tentatively titled "The Vacation Song". He previewed about 10 seconds of the "rough edit" of the song, and stated that he was going to change the mood of the song, saying, "Right now, it's a little too happy, because it's a break up song. I want it to be more like [[Kelly Clarkson]]'s '[[Since U Been Gone]]'." He stated that the song would "hopefully" be released by the beginning of June 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9zx8JIq5hI&amp;feature=channel&amp;list=UL | title=MY BREAK UP SONG!

In October 2012, a film called ''[[Smiley (2012 film)|Smiley]]'' was released to theaters starring Dawson. In December, Dawson released a new single entitled "Maybe This Christmas". On February 5, 2013, Dawson recorded a single titled "F**K Up".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u605KFGsdc |title=Is Bieber Going To Jail!? |publisher=YouTube |date=February 5, 2013 |accessdate=September 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song was released on YouTube and iTunes on March 30, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY3OqM05xjo |title="F**K Up" Music Video By Shane Dawson |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=September 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 18, 2013, Dawson released a song entitled "Wanna Make Love To You", with Liam Horne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wanna Make Love To You - Single|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/wanna-make-love-to-you/id721854317?i=721854351|website=iTunes|accessdate=November 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dawson doesn't actually provide vocals to the song, but iTunes credits him as one of the artists.

===2013–present: ''Shane and Friends'', ''The Chair'', and books===
In June 2013, Dawson started a podcast entitled ''[[Shane and Friends]]''. As of 2013, Dawson revealed that he is pitching a [[talk show]] and is continuing to pitch the series about him working at a weight loss center. On November 12, 2013, Dawson announced that he was developing the weight loss center project with [[Sony Pictures Television]] for [[NBC]]. The project has been titled ''Losin' It'' and, if picked up, will be a half-hour [[single camera]] [[comedy]] series focusing on a successful former-client at a weight loss center who decides to share his inspiration by becoming a consultant at the center, and subsequently becomes the manager by the end of his first day. [[Darlene Hunt]], [[Will Gluck]], Richie Schwartz, Lauren Schnipper, and Dawson will serve as executive producers for the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/youtubes-shane-dawson-big-c-655331 | work=The Hollywood Reporter | first=Lacey | last=Rose | title=YouTube's Shane Dawson, 'Big C' Creator Team for Weight-Loss Comedy at NBC | date=November 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 4, 2014, Dawson announced that he had directed and starred in a comedy film in [[Pittsburgh]] earlier that year. The film, which was made on a budget of approximately $1 million, is expected to be released in September 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC2ljglqd9M |title=I MADE A MOVIE! |publisher=YouTube |date=April 4, 2014 |accessdate=February 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/shanedawson/status/452204247996575744|title=Shane Dawson's movie budget tweet|work=Twitter|accessdate=January 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 26, he announced that the film would be titled ''[[Not Cool (film)|Not Cool]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/shanedawson/status/482214092870938624|title=Shane Dawson on Twitter|work=Twitter|accessdate=January 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was part of a Starz original series called ''The Chair'', in which two novice directors are given the same script and must each make their own film from it. People who watched both films then voted online to vote for the films. ''Not Cool'' competed against Anna Martemucci's ''Holidaysburg''. [[Zachary Quinto]], producer of ''The Chair'', called Dawson's film "deeply offensive" and "tasteless", and that Dawson should not be making films at all, removing his name from the film in disgust. Dawson defended his film by saying that "I like the movie. The producers that I trust like the movie. The test audience liked the movie. I know I deserve to make a movie because I've been working my fucking ass off these last eight years on YouTube."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nemetz|first1=Dave|title='The Chair' Exclusive: Shane Dawson Reacts to Zachary Quinto Dissing His Movie|url=https://tv.yahoo.com/blogs/tv-news/the-chair-exclusive--shane-dawson-reacts-to-zachary-quinto-dissing-his-movie-165124392.html|website=Yahoo TV|accessdate=December 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dawson won the competition, winning the $250,000 prize to work on another film project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Spangler|first1=Todd|title=Shane Dawson Wins Starz 'The Chair' $250,000 Prize, But Not Everyone's Cool With It|url=https://variety.com/2014/digital/news/shane-dawson-wins-starz-the-chair-250000-prize-but-not-everyones-cool-with-it-1201351264/|website=Variety|accessdate=December 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2014, Dawson released a parody of [[Taylor Swift]]'s song "[[Blank Space]]" on [[YouTube]]. This video was found to be in poor taste by her labels, [[Big Machine Records]] and [[Sony]], who removed it,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shane Dawson Parody Pulled For Copyright Infringement? #shanedawsonsony|url=http://newmediarockstars.com/2014/12/shane-dawson-parody-pulled-for-copyright-infringement-shanedawsonsony/|accessdate=March 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; citing "copyright infringement". Dawson subsequently claimed that the parody was removed because Sony objected to the video's violent content. The video was restored in February 2015.

In early 2015, Dawson released a memoir titled ''[[I Hate Myselfie|I Hate Myselfie: A Collection of Essays]]''.
