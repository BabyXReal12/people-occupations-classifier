'''Jack E. Leonard''' (April 24, 1910 &amp;ndash; May 10, 1973), born '''Leonard Lebitsky''', was an [[United States|American]] [[comedian]] and [[actor]] who made frequent appearances on television [[variety show|variety]] and [[game show]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Obituary ''[[Variety Obituaries|Variety]]'', May 16, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTobit&gt;{{cite news|title=Jack E. Leonard, Comedian, Dead|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/05/11/archives/jack-e-leonard-comedian-dead-master-of-oneline-insult-for-nightclub.html|accessdate=6 April 2017|work=New York Times|date=May 11, 1973|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Leonard was born Leonard Lebitsky on April 24, 1910, in Chicago (“You know, the city where kids play robbers and robbers”), the son of a tailor. He claimed that one of his childhood friends was [[Baby Face Nelson]]. As a young man, he worked as a lifeguard (“I swam against [[Johnny Weissmuller]] ... and he was so fast I haven't seen him since”), and first worked professionally as a dancer, competing in [[Charleston (dance)|Charleston]] contests. In the 1930s, he joined a vaudeville troupe, then began touring with the [[big band]]s, playing nightclubs all over the country. During [[World War II]] he toured bases with the [[United Service Organizations]].&lt;ref name=NYTobit/&gt;

''[[The Tonight Show]]'', hosted by [[Jack Paar]], marked his first national exposure.  For the next several years he worked steadily in [[Las Vegas Strip|Las Vegas]], and made hundreds of television appearances on various panel and variety shows. He made occasional recordings, and appeared in a handful of motion pictures, such as ''[[Three Sailors and a Girl]]''.&lt;ref name=NYTobit/&gt;

Leonard's comedic method was [[sarcasm|sarcastic]] and aggressive, creating an "[[insult comedy|insult humor]]" genre which anticipated [[Don Rickles]]. (Rickles's [[Friars' Club]] roast was emceed by Leonard, who introduced Rickles as "a man who's been doing my act for about 12 years now.") A trademark line, after taking off his hat to reveal his bald head: "What did you expect, feathers?" He also referenced his weight problem in his act. Leonard's strong and unapologetic onstage personality ("Good evening, opponents!") belied a gentle and giving spirit that would occasionally be revealed in his act when he would sing a sentimental song.

He wore a distinctive outfit: a dark suit, purposely two sizes too small, a white narrow-brimmed hat, and [[horn-rimmed glasses]]. On one variety show, Leonard's contemporaneous popularity was demonstrated when a lookalike came on stage and did a Leonard-like [[Shtick|schtick]]. Then Leonard walked on stage and addressed his ''[[doppelgänger]]'': "You've got a great future, son, but not in this business!"

In March 1973, he collapsed shortly after finishing a performance at the [[Rainbow Room]] in [[New York City]] and underwent emergency [[cardiac bypass surgery]], but died several weeks later at the age of 63.&lt;ref name=NYTobit/&gt;
