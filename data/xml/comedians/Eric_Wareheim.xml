'''Eric Alexander Wareheim''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|w|ɛər|h|aɪ|m}}; born April 7, 1976) is an American actor, comedian, writer, director, and musician. He is one half of the comedy duo [[Tim &amp; Eric]], alongside [[Tim Heidecker]]. They created the television shows ''[[Tom Goes to the Mayor]]'', ''[[Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!]]'', ''[[Check It Out! with Dr. Steve Brule]]'', and ''[[Tim and Eric's Bedtime Stories]]''. He has a recurring role on the [[Netflix]] series ''[[Master of None]]''.

==Early life==
Wareheim was born in [[Audubon, Pennsylvania]]. He graduated from [[Methacton High School]] in [[Norristown, Pennsylvania]] and then later attended [[Temple University]], where he met his comedy partner Tim Heidecker and produced his first film about dads, shot on the [[Jersey shore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://usedwigs.com/interview_timanderic.html |title=Nagging Questions for... Tim Heidecker &amp; Eric Wareheim |year=2004 |work=UsedWigs |accessdate=2007-02-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070510050145/http://www.usedwigs.com/interview_timanderic.html |archivedate=2007-05-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Wareheim and Heidecker are the creators, writers, and stars of ''[[Tom Goes to the Mayor]]'', a [[limited animation]] that was on the [[Adult Swim]] programming block on [[Cartoon Network]].  Wareheim and Heidecker had mailed copies of an early version of the show to comedian [[Bob Odenkirk]], who agreed to take on the project as the executive producer of the series and sold it to Cartoon Network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117946848.html?categoryid=2242&amp;cs=1|title=10 Comics to Watch: Tim Heidecker and Eric Wareheim|first=Janelle|last=Brown|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=2006-07-17|accessdate=2007-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tim and Eric name was solidly branded with the release of ''[[Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!]]'' which premiered on February 11, 2007. The show is a mix of "live action, sketch, animation, emotions, phone calls, love, etc." according to their website. The creators have described the show as the "nightmare version of television".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/27/arts/television/27itzk.html|title=The Bizarre Brains of Nightmare TV|first=Dave|last=Itzkoff|work=[[New York Times]]|date=2008-07-27|accessdate=2018-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 2, 2010 the "Man Milk" episode of "Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!" wrapped Season 5 of the show. Though this would be the last serial content for "Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!" there was an hour-long holiday program titled "Chrimbus Special" that gave fans a last glimpse at the [[TV]] program. It was the second show Wareheim both produced and starred in which aired during Cartoon Network's [[Adult Swim]] block.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

===Billion Dollar Movie===
Wareheim also co-directed, wrote and starred in ''[[Tim and Eric's Billion Dollar Movie]]'' with Tim Heidecker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117946862?refcatid=31|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=February 20, 2012|date=January 21, 2012|author=Anderson, John|title=Tim and Eric's Billion Dollar Movie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!'' spinoffs===
Between May and June 2010, six episodes of an ''Awesome Show'' spin-off produced in part by Wareheim, ''[[Check It Out! with Dr. Steve Brule]]'', were aired on Cartoon Network. The show parodied [[local news]]casts. According to Heidecker, [[John C. Reilly]] had the original idea of giving the Dr. Steve character an entire show.&lt;ref name="vf"&gt;''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' article: "[http://www.vanityfair.com/online/oscars/2009/07/qa-tim-and-eric-on-child-abuse-diarrhea-and-yerba-mate-tea.html Q&amp;A: Tim and Eric on Child Abuse, Diarrhea, and Yerba-Mate Tea] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100328080729/http://www.vanityfair.com/online/oscars/2009/07/qa-tim-and-eric-on-child-abuse-diarrhea-and-yerba-mate-tea.html |date=2010-03-28 }}".&lt;/ref&gt;

In a July 2008 ''New York Times'' article, it was reported that the duo was in the process of developing a surreal [[game show]] series starring [[Neil Hamburger]], titled ''The New Big Ball with Neil Hamburger''.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;''[[New York Times]]'' article: "[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/27/arts/television/27itzk.html?_r=1&amp;ref=television&amp;oref=slogin The Bizarre Brains of Nightmare TV]".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Hardford Advocate'' article: "[http://www.hartfordadvocate.com/article.cfm?aid=9112 Hamburger Helper: America's 'worst' comedian performs in New Haven and then in Northampton]".&lt;/ref&gt; Wareheim described it as a mix between "[[Japanese variety show|Japanese bizarre game show]] and ''[[The Price Is Right]]''."&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; In late July 2009, Neil Hamburger posted a blog on [[MySpace]] stating that a [[pilot (television)|pilot]] had been filmed, but that Adult Swim was not satisfied and had "pulled the plug on the project."&lt;ref&gt;[[MySpace]] blog post by [[Neil Hamburger]]: "[http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&amp;friendId=53055268&amp;blogId=501569194 The New Big Ball] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207065936/http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view |date=2009-02-07 }}".&lt;/ref&gt;
