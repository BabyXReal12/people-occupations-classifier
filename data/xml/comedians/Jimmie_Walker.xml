'''James Carter Walker Jr.''' (born June 25, 1947) is an [[United States|American]] [[actor]] and [[stand-up comedian|comedian]]. Walker is best known for portraying James Evans Jr. ("J.J."), the oldest son of Florida and James Evans Sr. on the [[CBS]] [[television series]] ''[[Good Times]]'', which ran from [[1974 in television|1974]] to [[1979 in television|1979]]. Walker was nominated for [[Golden Globe]] awards ''Best Supporting Actor In A Television Series'' in 1975 and 1976 for his role. While on the show, Walker's character was known for the [[catchphrase]] ''"Dy-no-mite!"'' which he also used in his mid–1970s TV commercial for a [[Panasonic]] line of [[Compact Cassette|cassette]] and [[8-track tape]] players. He also starred in ''[[Let's Do It Again (1975 film)|Let's Do It Again]]'' with John Amos, and ''The Greatest Thing That Almost Happened'' with [[James Earl Jones]]. Walker continues to tour the country with his stand-up comedy routine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dynomitejj.com/gigs.asp |title=Jimmie JJ Walker's Gigs |accessdate=2008-08-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080817141127/http://www.dynomitejj.com/gigs.asp |archivedate=2008-08-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=30 years after 'J.J.,' Walker still draws laughs.|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-17733368_ITM|date=2006-07-24|work=The Columbus Dispatch|accessdate=2008-08-18 | first=Michael | last=Grossberg}} (requires login)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Walker was born in [[The Bronx, New York]]. Walker attended [[Theodore Roosevelt High School (New York City)|Theodore Roosevelt High School]] in [[New York City]]. Through a federal program known as ''SEEK,'' or "Search for Education, Evaluation, and Knowledge," he continued his studies and entered into the field of radio engineering with WRVR. As a young man, Walker was a vendor at [[Yankee Stadium]], starting with the [[1964 World Series]]. He was given a [[United States dollar coin|silver dollar]] by [[Mickey Mantle]], which he still has.

==Career==
In 1967, Walker began working full-time with [[WLTW|WRVR]], the radio station of the [[Riverside Church]]. In 1969, Walker began performing as a [[stand-up comedian]] and was eventually discovered by the casting director for ''[[Good Times]]'', after making appearances on ''[[Rowan &amp; Martin's Laugh In]]'' and on the ''[[Jack Paar|Jack Paar Show]]''. He eventually released one stand-up comedy album during the height of his ''Good Times'' popularity: ''Dyn-o-mite'' on Buddah Records (5635). During ''Good Times''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; [[1974–75 United States network television schedule|1974–75 season]], Walker was 26 years old, though his character was much younger. [[John Amos]], the actor who portrayed Walker's father on ''Good Times,'' was actually just eight years older than Walker. Walker credits producer/director [[John Rich (director)|John Rich]] for inventing "Dy-no-mite!" which Rich insisted Walker say on every episode. Both Walker and executive producer [[Norman Lear]] were skeptical of the idea, but the phrase and Walker's character caught on with the audience.&lt;ref name=CNN /&gt; Also, off- and on-camera, Walker did not get along with series' lead, [[Esther Rolle]], who played [[Florida Evans]], in the series, because she and Amos disapproved of Walker's increasingly buffoonish character and his popularity, and Walker felt hurt by their disdain. Dissatisfaction led Amos (before Rolle), to leave the show, making Walker the star of the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sitcomsonline.com/boards/archive/index.php/t-53025.html|title=Was Jimmie Walker getting along with Esther Rolle and John Amos on the set?
