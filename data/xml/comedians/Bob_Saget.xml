His television roles include [[Danny Tanner]] on the ABC sitcom ''[[Full House]]'' (1987–95) and its Netflix sequel ''[[Fuller House (TV series)|Fuller House]]'', and hosting ''[[America's Funniest Home Videos]]'' from 1989 to 1997. Saget is also known for his [[Blue comedy|adult-oriented]] stand-up routine.&lt;ref name="Gale"&gt;{{cite journal|author-link=Thomson Gale |title=Biography – Saget, Bob |year=2004 |publisher=[[Thomson Gale]]|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also provided the voice of the future [[Ted Mosby]] on the CBS sitcom ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]'' from 2005 to 2014.

Saget's 2014 [[comedy album]], ''That's What I'm Talkin' About'', was nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album]].

== Early life ==
Saget was born in [[Philadelphia]] to a [[Jews|Jewish]] family. His father, Benjamin (August 28, 1917 – January 30, 2007),&lt;ref name="Benjamin M., Saget, supermarket chain senior executive; 89"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/obituaries/article/obituaries_20070216|title=Benjamin M., Saget, supermarket chain senior executive; 89|publisher=JewishJournal.com|date=2007-02-16|accessdate=2015-03-28|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402113629/http://www.jewishjournal.com/obituaries/article/obituaries_20070216|archivedate=2015-04-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a supermarket executive, and his mother, Rosalyn "Dolly" (February 12, 1925 – February 15, 2014),&lt;ref name="Rosalyn C. Saget"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/latimes/obituary.aspx?pid=169854326|title=Rosalyn C. Saget| publisher=Legacy.com| date= 2014-02-16|accessdate=2015-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a hospital administrator. Saget lived in [[California]] before moving back to Philadelphia and graduating from high school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Bob Saget | publisher = film.com | url = http://www.film.com/celebrities/bob-saget/14646642 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914072843/http://www.film.com/celebrities/bob-saget/14646642 |archivedate=2008-09-14| accessdate = 2012-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Goldberg | first = Jennifer | title = Irreverent Bob Saget plays to full houses | work = Jewish News of Greater Phoenix Online | date = 2007-09-07 | url = http://www.jewishaz.com/issues/story.mv?070907+saget | accessdate = 2008-11-17 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081205183022/http://www.jewishaz.com/issues/story.mv?070907+saget | archivedate = 2008-12-05 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Saget originally intended to become a [[Physician|doctor]], but his [[Honors course|Honors]] English teacher, Elaine Zimmerman, saw his creative potential and urged him to seek a career in films.&lt;ref name="Gale" /&gt;

Saget attended [[Temple University]]'s film school, where he created ''Through Adam's Eyes'', a [[black-and-white]] film about a boy who received reconstructive facial surgery and was honored with an award of merit in the [[Student Academy Awards]]. He graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oscars.org/saa/winners/winners.pdf |title=Student Academy Awards Winners |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060207061453/http://www.oscars.org/saa/winners/winners.pdf |archivedate=2006-02-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Saget intended to take graduate courses at the [[University of Southern California]] but quit a few days later. Saget describes himself at the time in an article by Glenn Esterly in the 1990 ''[[Saturday Evening Post]]'': "I was a cocky, overweight twenty-two-year-old. Then I had a [[gangrene|gangrenous]] [[Vermiform appendix|appendix]] taken out, almost died, and I got over being cocky or overweight."&lt;ref name="biography.com"&gt;[http://www.biography.com/articles/Bob-Saget-328690 "Bob Saget"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100113093830/http://www.biography.com/articles/Bob-Saget-328690 |date=January 13, 2010 }}. Biography.com.&lt;/ref&gt; Saget talked about his burst appendix on ''[[Anytime with Bob Kushell]]'', saying that it happened on the [[Fourth of July]], at the [[UCLA Medical Center]] and that they at first just iced the area for seven hours before taking it out and finding that it had become gangrenous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | title = Anytime with Bob Kushell feat.

== Career ==


===1987–2001 ===
Following a short stint as a member of CBS' ''[[The Morning Program]]'' in early 1987, Saget was cast as [[Danny Tanner]] in ''[[Full House]]'', which became a success with family viewers, and landed in the [[Nielsen ratings]]' Top 30 beginning with season three. In 1989, Saget began as the host of ''[[America's Funniest Home Videos]]'', a role he held until 1997. During the early 1990s, Saget worked both on ''Full House'' and ''AFV'' simultaneously. In 2009, he returned to ''AFV'' for the 20th-anniversary one-hour special co-hosted with [[Tom Bergeron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Snierson | first = Dan | title = Bob Saget returns to 'America's Funniest Home Videos' for 20th anniversary celebration | newspaper = Entertainment Weekly | date = September 16, 2008   | url =http://insidetv.ew.com/2009/09/16/bob-saget-returns-to-americas-funniest-home-videos-for-one-episode/ | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saget directed the 1996 ABC [[television movie]] ''[[For Hope]]'', which was inspired by the life story of his sister, Gay Saget, who died from [[scleroderma]] three years earlier.&lt;ref name="Gale"/&gt;

In 1998, Saget directed his first feature film, ''[[Dirty Work (1998 film)|Dirty Work]]'', starring [[Norm Macdonald]] and [[Artie Lange]]. Released one year after he left his long-running role as host of ''America's Funniest Home Videos'', the film received broadly negative reviews from critics and earned low box office returns. However, it has since become a cult favorite, due partially to Artie Lange's later popularity on ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'' where the film is sometimes mentioned, often in unflattering terms.

In 1998, Saget made a [[cameo appearance]] as a [[cocaine]] addict in the stoner comedy ''[[Half Baked]]''.

===2001–present===
[[File:Bob_Saget_Traveling_Virus_Worcester_2006.jpg|thumb|right|Bob Saget on stage during the [[Opie and Anthony's Traveling Virus Comedy Tour (2006)|Opie and Anthony's Traveling Virus Comedy Tour]] in 2006]]
Saget had a sitcom on [[The WB]] titled ''[[Raising Dad]]''. It co-starred [[Kat Dennings]], [[Brie Larson]], and [[Jerry Adler]] and lasted only one season.

Saget was host of NBC's game show ''[[1 vs. 100 (U.S. game show)|1 vs. 100]]'' from 2006 to 2008.

Saget served as the voice of the future [[Ted Mosby]], who narrated the [[CBS]] [[sitcom]] ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]'', which premiered on September 19, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Harnick, Chris (April 11, 2014). [http://www.eonline.com/news/530959/bob-saget-reveals-what-he-really-thought-about-the-how-i-met-your-mother-series-finale "Bob Saget Reveals What He Really Thought About the ''How I Met Your Mother'' Series Finale"]. [[E! Online]].&lt;/ref&gt;

His [[HBO]] comedy special, ''That Ain't Right'', came out on DVD on August 28, 2007. It is dedicated to his father, Ben Saget, who died at age 89 on January 30, 2007, due to complications from congestive heart failure.

From 2005 to 2010, Saget had a recurring role in four episodes of the [[HBO]] TV series ''[[Entourage (U.S. TV series)|Entourage]]'' playing a parody of himself. He would later appear in the 2015 feature film based on the series.

[[File:Bob Saget.jpg|thumb|left|Saget performing in 2007]]
Saget wrote, directed, and starred in ''[[Farce of the Penguins]]'', a parody of 2005's ''[[March of the Penguins]]'', which was released [[direct-to-video|direct-to-DVD]], in January 2007.

Saget appeared in the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[Musical theatre|musical]] ''[[The Drowsy Chaperone]]'' for a limited four-month engagement. He played "Man in Chair" while [[Jonathan Crombie]], who normally played the character on Broadway, was with the national tour of the musical. On January 4, 2008, Saget's [[caricature]] was unveiled at [[List of caricatures at Sardi's restaurant|Sardi's Restaurant]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://my.broadwayworld.com/viewcolumn.cfm?colid=24093 "Photo Coverage: Bob Saget Receives Sardi's Portrait"]. BroadwayWorld.com. January 7, 2008. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080109024550/http://my.broadwayworld.com/viewcolumn.cfm?colid=24093 |date=January 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2009, he debuted in a new sitcom along with his co-star [[Cynthia Stevenson]] on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] called ''[[Surviving Suburbia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abcmedianet.com/web/dnr/dispDNR.aspx?id=020409_02 "ABC Announces New Sitcom 'Surviving Suburbia'"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221234828/http://www.abcmedianet.com/web/dnr/dispDNR.aspx?id=020409_02 |date=February 21, 2009 }}. ABC.com. Press Release. February 4, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The series, which was originally to air on [[The CW]], ended after one abbreviated season.

In 2010, Saget starred in an [[A&amp;E Network|A&amp;E]] series ''Strange Days'' in which he follows others in different activities and lifestyles, documenting their adventures in unusual ways.

In 2014, his book ''Dirty Daddy'' was released, in which Saget writes about his career, comedy influences, and experiences with life and death. He embarked on a small tour in support of the book, including the [[Pemberton Music Festival]], where he introduced [[Snoop Dogg]] prior to performing his own set. In the same year, he toured [[Australia]] for the first time, with a stand-up show called ''Bob Saget Live: The Dirty Daddy Tour''. The show was performed in the major cities of [[Melbourne]], [[Sydney]], [[Brisbane]], and [[Perth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/books-magazines/bob-saget-reveals-in-his-memoir-dirty-daddy-what-really-went-on-behind-the-scenes-of-full-house/news-story/d7152b28213f4221e975b7bfa5a3e7a9|title=Bob Saget: Secrets from Full House|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 and 2016, he guest-starred in two episodes of ''[[Grandfathered (TV series)|Grandfathered]]'', starring and produced by his ''Full House'' co-star, [[John Stamos]].

== Charity work ==
Saget is currently a board member of the [[Scleroderma Research Foundation]]. His [[scleroderma]] efforts have further benefited such celebrities as ''[[Scary Movie (film series)|Scary Movie]]'' star [[Regina Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abilitymagazine.com/regina-hall.html |title=Regina Hall Discusses Scleroderma |work=Ability Magazine |issue="Regina Hall Issue" |date=April–May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with [[Ability (magazine)|''Ability Magazine'']], Saget discussed how his sister was diagnosed with scleroderma at 43 and died at 47. Before that, she had been misdiagnosed many times. {{blockquote|"Unfortunately, rheumatologists in a lot of places don’t have very many scleroderma patients come through their labs, and no one knew what to do with her. I wish I’d known then what I know now." Because of this, Saget is involved in fundraising efforts towards finding a cure for the disease, saying, "There’s also a Scleroderma Foundation, and we’re separate from them, but one of the Scleroderma Foundation board heads is also on the Scleroderma Research Foundation board. We're all basically trying to cure the same thing. Our organization has raised $25 million for research. Our chairman, Luke Evnin, is an amazing man and lives up in San Francisco with his wife, Deann Wright. They’re both brilliant scientists and doctors. Dana Delany’s on the board, Caryn Zucker, Kristen Baker Bellamy, who lost her mother to scleroderma, and is married to Bill Bellamy. Robin Williams worked our first benefit. A number of celebrities sign on, which helps to give the disease a higher profile. As you may know, Regina, a significant number of the people who get scleroderma are African-American."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abilitymagazine.com/Bob-Saget.html|title=Bob Saget Interview with Regina Hall and Chet Cooper|work=Ability Magazine |issue="Bob Saget Issue" |date=April–May 2011 |accessdate=2012-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
