Perhaps Richards' most popular character on ''SNL'' was "Drunk Girl", who appeared on the ''[[Weekend Update]]'' segment nine times.

Richards has also done voice work which includes characters in the 2004 video game [[EverQuest II]], a character in the 2006 [[MTV]] animated series ''[[Where My Dogs At?]]'' and in 2010 he played the voice of [[Brad Pitt]] in an episode titled ""The Wedding" of the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] sitcom ''[['Til Death]]''.&lt;ref name=IMDB/&gt;

Richards produced a comedic album titled ''A$$WAX'' which was released on iTunes on March 3, 2009;&lt;ref name=COLLEGE/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/a$$wax/id302411290 ''A$$WAX''] on [[iTunes]]&lt;/ref&gt; a portion of the proceeds from the album's sales was used to fight world hunger.&lt;ref name=COLLEGE/&gt; Richard also performed in a series of comedy benefit shows called "Asswax 4 Hunger" in 2009; the shows were hosted by friend [[Kato Kaelin]].
