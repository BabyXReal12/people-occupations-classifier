She is known for her role as a cast member on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' and for her autobiographical solo shows. She played Mrs. Keeper in the film ''[[Stuart Little (film)|Stuart Little]]'' and voiced Brittany in ''[[Father of the Pride]]''.&lt;ref name=NYTimes-NotOneThingMother-2013&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dell'Antonia|first1=KJ|title=Motherlode: Julia Sweeney Sees the Absurd in Motherhood (and Shares)|url=http://parenting.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/11/julia-sweeney-sees-the-absurd-in-motherhood-and-shares/|accessdate=21 February 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Sweeney was born in [[Spokane, Washington]], the daughter of Robert M. Sweeney and Jeri Sweeney (née Ivers).&lt;ref name=YakimaHerald-GmaIvers-2001&gt;{{cite web|title=Marie Ann Ivers|url=http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/GER-VOLGA/2001-03/0985644727|website=[[Yakima Herald Republic]]|accessdate=21 February 2015|date=25 March 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father was an attorney and federal prosecutor, while her mother was a homemaker. Sweeney has an Irish Catholic background.&lt;ref name=SeattleTimes-SNL-1993&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ramirez|first1=Marc|title=Pat's World -- It's Funny Business, Hard Work And A Little Too Much Attention For Julia Sweeney|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19930131&amp;slug=1682852|accessdate=21 February 2015|work=[[The Seattle Times]]|date=31 January 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sweeney is the oldest of five children. She had two brothers, William "Bill" Sweeney, and Michael Ivers Sweeney,&lt;ref name=FamilySearch-CADeathIndex-Michael-1995&gt;{{cite web|title=Michael Ivers Sweeney - California, Death Index|url=https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/VPVG-VBF|website=[[FamilySearch]]|date=31 March 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; who died, and a brother Jim Sweeney, and a sister Meg Sweeney.

Sweeney was raised in Spokane. As a child, she was drawn to imitating voices and inventing characters.&lt;ref name="PBSSweeney"&gt;{{cite web|title=Behind the Curtain: Julia Sweeney|url=https://www.pbs.org/weta/onstage/twain2002/bios/sweeney.html|website=PBS.org|accessdate=2 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sweeney attended Marycliff High School and [[Gonzaga Preparatory School]], where she appeared in a number of plays.&lt;ref name=SeattleTimes-SNL-1993 /&gt; She graduated with a double major in economics and European history at the [[University of Washington]],&lt;ref name=SeattleTimes-SNL-1993 /&gt; where she became a member of [[Delta Gamma]] sorority.&lt;ref name="CelebrityParents2013"&gt;{{cite web|title=Celebrity Parents Magazine: Julia Sweeney Issue|url=http://www.celebrityparentsmag.com/on-the-cover-julia-sweeney/|website=Celebrity Parents Magazine|accessdate=2 September 2016|date=6 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduation, Sweeney moved to Los Angeles where she worked as an accountant for [[Columbia Pictures]] and [[United Artists]].&lt;ref name=WTF-Maron-2014&gt;{{cite web|last1=Maron|first1=Marc|title=Episode 553 - Julia Sweeney|url=http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episodes/episode_553_-_julia_sweeney|website=[[WTF with Marc Maron]]|accessdate=21 February 2015|format=Audio podcast|date=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
In 1988, while still working as an accountant, Sweeney enrolled in classes with the [[improvisational comedy]] troupe [[The Groundlings]], eventually being selected to be part of the troupe's Sunday Company. It was at The Groundlings that she began to develop characters, which she would later bring to the stage, film, and television.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/notable-alumni-of-the-groundlings-improv-troupe/16/|title=Notable alumni of the Groundlings improv troupe|date=2015-06-25|language=en|access-date=2017-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; They include Mea Culpa, the title character of ''Mea's Big Apology'' (co-written by then-husband [[Stephen Hibbert]]), which won the Best Written Play Award from ''[[L.A. Weekly]]'' in 1988 and has been developed by Sweeney (in collaboration with Jim Emerson) into a screenplay; and the [[androgyny|androgynous]] [[Pat (Saturday Night Live)|Pat]], whose impossible-to-determine [[gender]] was the basis for Sweeney's popular ''It's Pat!'' skits on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', and later for her feature film of the same name, which was pulled from theaters after one week due to its immensely negative reception.&lt;ref name="PBSSweeney" /&gt;

In 1992, she also worked with the rock band [[Ugly Kid Joe]], performing in the music video for their hit "Neighbor" and contributing introductory audio to two tracks, "Goddamn Devil" and "[[Everything About You (Ugly Kid Joe song)|Everything About You]]". The latter was on the soundtrack to the [[Lorne Michaels]] movie ''[[Wayne's World]]''.

In 1994, she had a small role as "Raquel" in the movie ''[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]''.

=== ''Saturday Night Live'' ===
At a Groundlings performance in 1989, ''Saturday Night Live'' (''SNL'') producer [[Lorne Michaels]] discovered Sweeney and offered her a spot as one of SNL's featured players.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} She joined the regular SNL cast the following year and remained with the show through four seasons, from 1990 to 1994.

Sweeney's 1993 impression of [[Chelsea Clinton]] caused a stir when [[Hillary Clinton]] found it offensive and sent an angry letter to ''SNL''{{'}}s Studio 8H.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wbez.org/story/wikipedia-files/introducing-wikipedia-files-julia-sweeney |title=Introducing The Wikipedia Files (with Julia Sweeney)!  |first= Andrew |last= Gill |date=April 10, 2009 |work= |publisher=WBEZ.org  |accessdate=April 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Monologues ===
Sweeney has created and performed three autobiographical monologues, ''God Said Ha!'', ''In the Family Way'', and ''Letting Go of God''.

====''God Said Ha!''====
After leaving the cast of ''Saturday Night Live'', Sweeney returned to Los Angeles where, shortly afterwards, her career was put on hold by a series of personal traumas. Her brother Michael was diagnosed with [[lymphoma]], and shortly thereafter Sweeney discovered that she too had cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|_7vsUflfPLA|Julia tells about her surgery and treatment}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her brother did not survive the cancer. Throughout the ordeal, Sweeney told stories of her experiences in serio-comic performances at L.A.'s [[alternative comedy]] club, the [[Un-Cabaret]], eventually developing the stories into a one-woman stage show, ''God Said Ha!'', which debuted at San Francisco's Magic Theater in 1995.&lt;ref name=tal9&gt;{{cite web|work=This American Life | title= Episode 9: Julia Sweeney |  url=http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/9/julia-sweeney |accessdate=September 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''God Said Ha!'' moved to Broadway, winning the 1996 New York Comedy Festival's Audience Award, and a CD recording of the show earned her a [[Grammy]] nomination for Best Comedy Album that same year. [[Miramax]] released a [[God Said Ha!|film version of the show]] in 1998, directed by Sweeney and produced by [[Quentin Tarantino]]. The film earned the [[Golden Space Needle Award]] at the Seattle Film Festival. It was released on DVD in 2003. Portions of the monologues from Un-Cabaret were featured on ''[[This American Life]]'' (then known as ''Your Radio Playhouse'') in January 1996 in [[List of 1996 This American Life episodes|episode 9]]. Since her initial monologue, she has appeared on three more ''This American Life'' episodes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisamericanlife.org/search?keys=julia%20sweeney Julia Sweeney search results] at ''This American Life''&lt;/ref&gt;

====''In the Family Way''====
Sweeney's second monologue chronicled the adoption of her daughter from China. ''In the Family Way'' started on stage in New York City in early 2003 at the [[Ars Nova Theatre]]. The show was directed by the Broadway stage director, [[Mark Brokaw]]. The show then migrated to the Groundlings Theatre in Los Angeles. Sweeney has also released a CD recording of ''In the Family Way'', and in 2006 she performed a 25-minute excerpt of this show at the [[Hollywood Bowl]] with a new orchestration written especially for her piece by the composer [[Anthony Marinelli]] and performed by the [[Los Angeles Philharmonic]].&lt;ref name="MusicConnection 1-1-07"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kimpel|first1=Dan|url=https://archive.org/details/MusicConnection010107XXXINo_01Interview |title=Award-Winning Film Composer|accessdate=18 September 2015|issue=XXXI, No. 1|publisher=''[[Music Connection]]''|date=1 January 2007|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LAPhil In the Family Way"&gt;{{cite web|title=Comedy Tonight! With special guests The Smothers Brothers &amp; Julia Sweeney|url=http://www.hollywoodbowl.com/tickets/comedy-tonight-special-guests-smothers-brothers-amp-julia-sweeney/2006-08-25|publisher=[[Hollywood Bowl]]|accessdate=13 October 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151013115450/http://www.hollywoodbowl.com/tickets/comedy-tonight-special-guests-smothers-brothers-amp-julia-sweeney/2006-08-25|archivedate=October 13, 2015 |date=25 August 2006|quote=Saturday Night Live alum Julia Sweeney narrates a segment from her one-woman show, In the Family Way, set to brand new music by Anthony Marinelli.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Letting Go of God''====
Sweeney's third autobiographical monologue is titled ''Letting Go of God''. In it, she discusses her Catholic upbringing, early religious ideology, and the life events and internal search that led her to believe that the universe can function on its own without a deity to preside over it, and to her becoming an [[atheist]]. Sweeney shares the account of when her mother told her her birthday was really October 10 instead of September 10, and how traumatic it was to discover she was not a winsome [[Virgo (astrology)|Virgo]] but really a [[Libra (astrology)|Libra]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/2013/11/22/245953429/how-does-a-person-go-from-believer-to-atheist "How Does A Person Go From Believer To Atheist?"]. [[NPR]]. November 22, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

She worked the show in small theaters and clubs around Los Angeles for three years and then opened it at the Hudson Backstage Theater in October 2004. An audio recording of ''Letting Go of God'' was released on CD in 2006, and it was filmed live on stage in May 2007. The film premiered at the [[Seattle International Film Festival]] on June 13, 2008. The DVD of the show was released in November 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Letting Go of God (2008) Plot Summary|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1027091/plotsummary?ref_=tt_ov_pl|website=IMDb|accessdate=2 September 2016|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Dawkins]] referenced ''Letting Go of God'' several times in his book ''[[The God Delusion]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Dawkins, Richard. ''The God Delusion''. Houghton Mifflin Company, 2006, Preface, p.4 and "Chapter 9: Childhood, Abuse And The Escape From Religion", p.323.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other roles ===
Julia Sweeney was a writer for the ''SNL'' film ''[[It's Pat]]'', in which she played the title character. She has appeared on the big screen in ''[[Gremlins 2: The New Batch]]'', ''[[Coneheads (film)|Coneheads]]'', ''[[Pulp Fiction]]'', ''[[Clockstoppers]]'', ''[[Whatever It Takes (2000 film)|Whatever It Takes]]'', and ''[[Stuart Little (film)|Stuart Little]]''. A veteran of live television, Sweeney made her mark on primetime television as a series regular on ''[[George and Leo]]'' and ''[[Maybe It's Me (TV series)|Maybe It's Me]]'' and she guest starred on ''[[3rd Rock from the Sun]]'', ''[[Hope &amp; Gloria]]'', ''[[Mad About You]]'', and ''[[According to Jim]]''. In 2004, Sweeney co-starred in two episodes of ''[[Frasier]]'' (as Frasier's blind date turned litigious unwanted houseguest, Ann Hodges) and had a guest role on ''[[Sex and the City]]''. She served as a consultant on ''Sex and the City'' for its last three seasons. She also consulted on season two of ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'' and was the voice of Margo on the ABC animated series ''[[The Goode Family]]'', and serves as the voice of Dr. Glove on ''[[Back at the Barnyard]]''.

In a segment for ''[[This American Life]]'' in 1999, Sweeney describes one of her first jobs, as a bartender's assistant, how she began embezzling funds from her employer, and the consequences thereof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work= This American Life| title= Allure of Crime, Act I: Your Good Girl's Gonna Go Bad| url=http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/135/allure-of-crime?act=1| accessdate=December 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 and 2010, Sweeney performed with singer/songwriter [[Jill Sobule]] in a revue called ''Jill and Julia.'' Sweeney and Sobule originally met at a [[TED (conference)|Technology Entertainment and Design]] (TED) conference and performed together at TED in 2008. They brought the show on the road in 2009 and 2010, performing in New York, Denver and other locations. The show is an autobiographical mix of music, stories and commentary.

Sweeney is also a part of the regular rotation of panelists for the [[NPR]] news quiz [[radio program|radio show]] ''[[Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me!]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wwdt.me/ |title=NPR's Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me!: Show Details and Statistics |author=Linh Pham |date= |work= |publisher= WWDT.me| accessdate=30 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in downtown Chicago.
