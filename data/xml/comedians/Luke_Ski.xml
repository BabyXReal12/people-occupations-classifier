'''Luke Collis Sienkowski''' (born January 14, 1974), better known as '''the great Luke Ski''' or simply as '''Luke Ski''',  is a [[parody]], [[filk]], and [[Hip hop music|rap]] artist who writes, records and performs comedy music. The decapitalization of the words "the great" in Sienkowski's stage name is his own preferred spelling, and the title has appeared as such on all of his albums to date.  He had the most requested song on the [[Dr. Demento]] radio show in 2002, 2003, 2011, and 2014 with his songs "[[Peter Parker]]" featuring [[Sudden Death (music)|Sudden Death]], "Stealing Like a [[Hobbit]]", "[[Snoopy]] the Dogg", and "Fake Adult" respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmdb.org/cgi-bin/plinfo.pl?funny25.02.html|title=Dr. Demento Funny 25 of 2002|author=Morris, Jeff|publisher=Demented Music Database|accessdate=2010-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmdb.org/cgi-bin/plinfo.pl?funny25.03.html|title=Dr. Demento Funny 25 of 2003|author=Morris, Jeff|publisher=Demented Music Database|accessdate=2010-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Topics of his parodies have included ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', ''[[Star Wars]]'', ''[[Spider-Man]]'', [[Keanu Reeves]] and [[Hamlet]]. He has, in one song, parodied ''all'' the ''[[Star Trek]]'' television shows. His parody songs are reminiscent of the [[pop music]] works of [["Weird Al" Yankovic]]. Luke helped bring parodies of rap and hip-hop to Science Fiction conventions. He does not play an instrument, and sings to pre-recorded music, often in costume or with props. Much of his work satirizes science fiction movies, television, and their marketing and are often from a fan perspective. Many of his longer works are snippets of song parodies collected together into an extended medley, such as ''Grease Wars'' or ''It's A Fanboy Christmas''.

Since 1996, Luke has released numerous albums. He is a frequent performer at [[science fiction]] and [[Role-playing game|gaming]] [[Fan convention|convention]]s. Luke is also a caricature artist, and has done the [[cover art]] for several of his own albums (with the notable exception of ''UnCONVENTIONal'', which features the artwork of [[John Kovalic]]).

Luke Ski hosts the weekly show ''Dementia Revolution'' on Dementia Radio and  has a bi-monthly podcast that he hosts with back-up vocalist Carrie Dahlby called "Luke and Carrie's Bad Rapport" where in each episode there are several segments in which the two talk about different things; this podcast also regularly features comedy music. He also is the co-host of "Kyle and Luke Talk About Toons" where he and fellow comedy musician and artist [[Kyle Carrozza]] discuss animation related topics. Luke also worked as a storyboard revisionist, storyboard artist, writer and voice actor for Kyle's series on [[Cartoon Network]], ''[[Mighty Magiswords]]'' from March 30, 2015&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thegreatlukeski.com/2015/03/13/luke-ski-goes-to-hollywood/&lt;/ref&gt; to February 2, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/thegreatlukeski/status/959127069073403904&lt;/ref&gt; 
Luke's frequent-voiced character, Skullivan, and first voiced character "Docky Boardman", debuted in the episode "Cleanliness is Next to Grupliness" and short "Too Many Warriors" which aired on October 20 and September 5, 2016. The first short he worked on, "Pool Fools" and episode he worked on, "Gotta Get Grup to Get Down", premiered in August 29 and November 11, 2016. Luke portrayed [[P.T. Barnum]] on three episodes of ''[[The Radio Adventures of Dr. Floyd]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Luke appeared as several characters in the [[Shockwave Radio Theater]] production "Let's Play Doctor" at the 2004 Marscon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.romm.org/tapes.html|title=Shockwave Distribution CD &amp; Tape List|publisher=Dave Romm|access-date=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
