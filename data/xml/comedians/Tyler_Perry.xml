'''Tyler Perry''' (born '''Emmitt Perry Jr.'''; September 13, 1969)&lt;ref name="BiographyCom" /&gt; is an American actor, playwright, and filmmaker. In 2011, ''[[Forbes]]'' listed him as the highest paid man in entertainment, earning $130&amp;nbsp;million [[United States dollar|USD]] between May 2010 and 2011.&lt;ref name="aitken1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Aitken |first=Peter C. |url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2011-09-13/entertainment/30173758_1_forbes-list-browns-and-house-tyler-perry |title=Tyler Perry tops Forbes' list of the highest-paid men in entertainment with $130&amp;nbsp;million made in a year|location=New York|work=Daily News|date=September 13, 2011 |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perry created and performs the [[Madea]] character, a tough elderly black woman.&lt;ref name="google1"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R7nlzASASNsC&amp;pg=PA444&amp;dq=Madea+avenging&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=LWDfUPOwDarU2QWvyYH4DQ&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Madea%20avenging&amp;f=false |title=Another Fine Mess: A History of American Film Comedy|author=Saul Austerlitz|publisher=|date= |accessdate=December 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.10-movies.com/ |title=10-movies |publisher=10-movies |date= |accessdate=December 31, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130423030541/http://www.10-movies.com/ |archivedate=April 23, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=473FLGx5ZFsC&amp;pg=PA131&amp;dq=Madea+large&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OL3rUKnQBabO2QWQyYGwCQ&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Madea%20large&amp;f=false |title=Fierce Angels: The Strong Black Woman in American Life and Culture|author=Sheri Parks|publisher=|date= |accessdate=January 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perry's films vary in style from orthodox filmmaking techniques to filmed productions of live stage plays. Perry is estimated to have earned around US$75&amp;nbsp;million by 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.singersroom.com/news/4143/Tyler-Perry-and-Simon-Cowell-Have-Forbes-In-Common "Tyler Perry, Simon Cowell Share Hollywood, Forbes in Common"]. Singersroom.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of Perry's stage-play films have been subsequently adapted as films.

Perry wrote and produced many stage plays during the 1990s and early 2000s. Perry has developed several television series, most notably ''[[Tyler Perry's House of Payne]]'', which ran for eight seasons on [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] from June 21, 2006, to August 10, 2012. On October 2, 2012, Perry struck an exclusive multi-year partnership with [[Oprah Winfrey]] and her [[Oprah Winfrey Network (U.S. TV channel)|Oprah Winfrey Network]]. The partnership was largely for the sake of bringing [[television program#scripted entertainment|scripted television]] to the OWN, based on Perry's previous success in this area.&lt;ref name="oprah"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oprah.com/pressroom/Oprah-Strikes-Partnership-with-Tyler-Perry |title=Oprah Strikes Partnership with Tyler Perry |publisher=Oprah.com |date= |accessdate=June 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perry has created multiple scripted series for the network, ''[[The Haves and the Have Nots (TV series)|The Haves and the Have Nots]]'' being its most successful. ''The Haves and the Have Nots'' has given OWN its highest ratings to date as of 2014,&lt;ref name="Rick Kissell @ratesrick"&gt;{{cite news|author=Rick Kissell @ratesrick |url=https://variety.com/2014/tv/ratings/haves-and-have-nots-sets-own-ratings-record-with-its-finale-1201130322/ |title='Haves and Have Nots' Sets OWN Ratings Record With Its Finale |publisher=Variety |date=March 12, 2014 |accessdate=March 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the series also referred to as "one of OWN's biggest success stories with its weekly dose of soapy fun, filled with the typical betrayals, affairs, and manipulations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Halterman |first=Jim |url=http://www.thebacklot.com/aaron-oconnell-gavin-houston-weigh-in-on-the-haves-and-the-have-nots-gay-story/08/2013/ |title=Aaron O'Connell &amp; Gavin Houston On 'The Haves and the Have Nots' Gay Story |publisher=thebacklot.com |date= |accessdate=August 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

Perry was born in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], as Emmitt Perry Jr., the son of Willie Maxine Perry (née Campbell) and Emmitt Perry, Sr., a carpenter.&lt;ref name="eta"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Perry, Willie Maxine Campbell|work=[[The Advocate (Louisiana)|The Advocate]]|date=December 11, 2009|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=AD&amp;p_theme=ad&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=12C8B2C28A992A50&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|accessdate=November 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has three siblings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/theadvocate/obituary.aspx?n=willie-maxine-campbell-perry&amp;pid=137150585 |title=Willie Maxine Campbell Perry Obituary: View Willie Perry's Obituary by The Advocate |publisher=Legacy.com |date=December 8, 2009 |accessdate=December 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perry once said his father's answer to everything was to "beat it out of you".&lt;ref name="JRankBio" /&gt; As a child, Perry once went so far as to attempt suicide in an effort to escape his father's beatings. In contrast to his father, his mother took him to church each week, where he sensed a certain refuge and contentment.&lt;ref name="JRankBio"&gt;{{cite web| year = 2010|url=http://biography.jrank.org/pages/2872/Perry-Tyler.html| title= Tyler Perry Biography&amp;nbsp;– Inspired by Oprah, Perseverance Paid Off, Concentrated on Madea Character| publisher= Net Industries| accessdate =January 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; At age 16, he had his first name legally changed from Emmitt to Tyler in an effort to distance himself from his father.&lt;ref name="BiographyCom"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biography.com/people/tyler-perry-361274| title=Tyler Perry Biography: Film Actor, Filmmaker, Screenwriter, Playwright (1969–)| publisher=[[Biography.com]] ([[FYI (U.S. TV channel)|FYI]] / [[A&amp;E Networks]]) | accessdate = December 15, 2015| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150909214402/http://www.biography.com/people/tyler-perry-361274 | archivedate= September 9, 2015|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many years later, after seeing the film ''[[Precious (film)|Precious]]'', Perry was moved to reveal for the first time that he had been [[molested]] by a friend's mother at age 10;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/Movies/10/06/tyler.perry.abuse.precious/ "Tyler Perry recounts childhood abuse on Web site"]. CNN. October 6, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; he was also molested by three men prior to this, and later learned his own father had molested his friend.&lt;ref name="People"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20310438,00.html| title= Tyler Perry Reveals He Was Abused as a Child| author=Park, Michael Y.|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]| date=October 6, 2009| accessdate=January 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A DNA test taken by Perry indicated that Emmitt Sr. was not Perry's biological father.&lt;ref name="Essence"&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Essence (magazine)|Essence]]|date=March 18, 2014|title=Tyler Perry: My Mother Lied About My Biological Father|first=Dominique|last=Hobdy|url=http://www.essence.com/2014/03/18/tyler-perry-dna-test-father}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Perry did not complete high school, he earned a [[General Educational Development|GED]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Oprah Talks to Tyler Perry|url=http://www.oprah.com/entertainment/Oprah-Interviews-Tyler-Perry_1/3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his early 20s, watching an episode of ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'', he heard someone describe the sometimes therapeutic effect the act of writing can have, enabling the author to work out his or her own problems. This comment inspired him to apply himself to a career in writing. He soon started writing a series of letters to himself, which became the basis for the musical ''[[I Know I've Been Changed]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Speaker Bio: Tyler Perry|url=http://www.natpe.org/conference/speakers/bios/index.jsp?speaker_id_string=3734:PYjS-98ZaG7syvaDDO6NpA**|work=natpe.org/|accessdate=May 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===Stage===

Around 1990, Perry moved to [[Atlanta]], where two years later ''I Know I've Been Changed'' was first performed at a community theater, financed by the 22-year-old Perry's $12,000 life savings.&lt;ref name="Forbes05"&gt;{{cite news | first=Brett | last=Pulley | title=A Showbiz Whiz | date=September 15, 2005 |url=https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2005/1003/075.html |work=Forbes | accessdate =March 25, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The play included Christian themes of forgiveness, dignity, and self-worth, while addressing issues such as child abuse and [[dysfunctional families]]. The musical initially received a "less than stellar" reception and was a financial failure.&lt;ref name="USAToday08"&gt;{{cite news | first=Scott | last=Bowles | title=Tyler Perry holds on to his past | date=September 10, 2008 |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2008-09-09-tyler-perry_N.htm |work=USA Today | accessdate =March 25, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Perry persisted, and over the next six years he rewrote the musical repeatedly, though lackluster reviews continued. In 1998, at age 28, he succeeded in retooling the play and restaging it in Atlanta, first at the [[House of Blues]], then at the [[Fox Theatre (Atlanta, Georgia)|Fox Theatre]]. Perry continued to create new stage productions, touring with them on the so-called "[[Chitlin' Circuit]]" (now also known as the "urban theater circuit")&lt;ref name="BiographyCom" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ebony04"&gt;{{cite magazine | last = Hughes | first = Zondra | magazine=[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]] |date=January 2004 | title = How Tyler Perry rose from homelessness to a $5&amp;nbsp;million mansion |url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1077/is_3_59/ai_111850312}}&lt;/ref&gt; and developing a large, devoted following among African-American audiences. In 2005, ''Forbes'' reported that he had sold "more than $100&amp;nbsp;million in tickets, $30&amp;nbsp;million in videos of his shows and an estimated $20&amp;nbsp;million in merchandise", and "the 300 live shows he produces each year are attended by an average of 35,000 people a week".&lt;ref name="Forbes05" /&gt;

===Film===

Perry raised a US $5.5&amp;nbsp;million budget in part from the ticket sales of his stage productions to fund his first movie, ''[[Diary of a Mad Black Woman]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reid|first1=Shaheem|title=Tyler Perry’s ‘Mad Black Woman’ Was No Overnight Success|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1498236/tyler-perrys-mad-black-woman-was-no-overnight-success/|website=MTV News}}&lt;/ref&gt; which went on to gross US$50.6&amp;nbsp;million domestically, while scoring a 16% approval rating at the film review web site ''[[Rotten Tomatoes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/diary_of_a_mad_black_woman | title=Diary of Mad Black Woman | work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | accessdate=October 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On its opening weekend, February 24–26, 2006, Perry's film version of ''[[Madea's Family Reunion]]'' opened at number one at the box office with $30.3&amp;nbsp;million. The film eventually grossed $65&amp;nbsp;million. Perry and his co-stars promoted the film on ''The Oprah Winfrey Show''. &lt;!--this next information is repeated in last para. of "Film."--&gt; As with ''Diary'', almost all of the ''Madea{{'}}''s earnings have been generated in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=madeasfamilyreunion.htm |title=Tyler Perry's Madea's Family Reunion|publisher=Boxofficemojo.com |date=April 27, 2006 |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perry's next [[Lions Gate Entertainment|Lionsgate]] project, ''[[Daddy's Little Girls]]'', starred [[Gabrielle Union]] and [[Idris Elba]] and was released in the United States on February 14, 2007. It grossed over US$31&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=daddyslittlegirls.htm |title=Tyler Perry's Daddy's Little Girls |publisher= Boxofficemojo.com |date=March 29, 2007 |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perry wrote, directed, produced and starred in his next film, ''[[Why Did I Get Married?]]'', released on October 12, 2007. It opened at number one, grossing US$21.4&amp;nbsp;million that weekend. It is loosely based on his play of the same name. Filming began March 5, 2007, in [[Whistler, British Columbia]], a resort town north of [[Vancouver, British Columbia|Vancouver]], then moved to Atlanta, where Perry had opened his own studio. [[Janet Jackson]], [[Sharon Leal]], [[Jill Scott]], and [[Tasha Smith]] appeared in the film. Perry's 2008 film, ''[[Meet the Browns (film)|Meet the Browns]]'', released on March 21, opened at number 2 with a US$20.1&amp;nbsp;million weekend gross.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tyler Perry's Meet the Browns|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=weekend&amp;id=meetthebrowns.htm|work=Box office mojo|accessdate=May 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Family That Preys]]'' opened on September 12, 2008, and grossed over US$37.1&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tyler Perry's The Family That Preys|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=familythatpreys.htm|work=boxofficemojo|accessdate=May 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Madea Goes to Jail]]'' opened at number one on February 20, 2009, grossing US$41&amp;nbsp;million and becoming his largest opening to date. This was Perry's seventh film with Lionsgate Entertainment. At the request of director [[J. J. Abrams]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Christian |first=Margena A. |date=October 2008 |title=Becoming Tyler |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PtMDAAAAMBAJ&amp;q=83#v=snippet&amp;q=83&amp;f=false |magazine=Ebony |page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; also in 2009, Perry had a small role as the [[Starfleet Academy]] commandant Admiral Barnett in ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'', which opened on May 8. This was his first film appearance outside of his own projects.
Perry next wrote, directed, and starred in ''[[I Can Do Bad All By Myself (film)|I Can Do Bad All By Myself]]'' (2009), a film structured around his Madea character. This was Perry's eighth film and it also made number one at the box office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tyler Perry's I Can Do Bad All By Myself |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20299647,00.html |date=August 21, 2009 |work=Entertainment Weekly |accessdate=September 3, 2009 |first=Tanner |last=Stransky}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Perry teamed with Oprah Winfrey to present ''Precious,'' a film based on the novel ''[[Push (novel)|Push]]'' by [[Sapphire (author)|Sapphire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title={{-'}}Precious' trailer: Mo'Nique... potential Oscar nominee? |url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2009/05/13/precious-traile/ |date=May 13, 2009 |work=Entertainment Weekly |accessdate=September 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''[[Why Did I Get Married Too?]]'', the sequel to ''Why Did I Get Married?'', opened in theaters on April 2, 2010. It featured [[Janet Jackson]], [[Cicely Tyson]], [[Louis Gossett, Jr.]], Jill Scott, and [[Malik Yoba]].

Perry directed a [[For Colored Girls|film adaptation]] of [[Ntozake Shange]]'s 1975 [[choreopoem]] ''[[For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When the Rainbow Is Enuf]]'', which was released in theaters November 5, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=124459269 "More Than 'Madea': Tyler Perry Changes Course"], ''[[All Things Considered]]'', March 8, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
He appeared in the stage show ''[[Madea's Big Happy Family]]'', which toured the U.S. as a stage play and was released as a movie in 2011, written, directed by, and starring Perry. The film version of ''[[Madea's Big Happy Family (film)|Madea's Big Happy Family]]'' raked in US$25.8&amp;nbsp;million at the box office, taking second place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Box Office: 'Rio' flies past 'Madea's Big Happy Family' to stay no. 1|url=http://www.hitfix.com/articles/box-office-rio-flies-past-madeas-big-happy-family-to-stay-no-1|accessdate=May 24, 2013|newspaper=Hitfix.com|date=April 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perry's next film with Lionsgate was ''[[Good Deeds]]'', in which Perry plays lead character Wesley Deeds.

====OWN and partnership with Oprah====

On October 2, 2012, Perry struck an exclusive multi-year partnership with [[Oprah Winfrey]] and her [[Oprah Winfrey Network (U.S. TV channel)|Oprah Winfrey Network]] (OWN). The partnership was largely for the purposes of bringing [[television program#scripted entertainment|scripted television]] to the OWN, Perry having had previous success in this department.&lt;ref name="oprah" /&gt;

''[[Tyler Perry's For Better or Worse]]'', based on his films ''[[Why Did I Get Married?]]'' and ''[[Why Did I Get Married Too?]]'', premiered on TBS on November 25, 2011.

==Legal actions==

===The Writers Guild of America, West===

The [[Writers Guild of America, West]] has filed unfair labor practice charges with the [[National Labor Relations Board]] (NLRB), alleging that Perry's production company, House of Payne, unlawfully fired four writers in October 2008 in retaliation for their trying to get a union contract.&lt;ref name="WGAWstrike"&gt;{{cite web|title=Writers at Tyler Perry Studio to Take Strike Action&amp;nbsp;– Will Picket Grand Opening and Ask Invited Guests Not To Attend |first=Gregg |last=Mitchell |year=2008 |url=http://www.wga.org/content/default.aspx?id=2970 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010045936/http://www.wga.org/content/default.aspx?id=2970 |archivedate=October 10, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The dispute was settled a month later, when Tyler Perry Studios agreed to be a WGA signatory.&lt;ref name="settlement"&gt;{{cite web|title=TOLDJA!

===Mo' Money Taxes===

In early 2009, Perry threatened legal action against Mo' Money Taxes, a tax preparation company based in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], for running a [[Television advertisement|TV spot]] that he felt offensively [[parody|parodied]] his work, in particular ''Madea Goes to Jail''. The ad features a large [[White people|Caucasian]] male (John Cowan) in [[Drag (clothing)|drag]], named "Ma'Madea". The "offending" ad was dropped from circulation.&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, Dee.

==Reception==

===Criticisms===
Despite praising Perry in 2006, director [[Spike Lee]] criticized his work in 2009, stating "Each artist should be allowed to pursue their artistic endeavors but I still think there is a lot of stuff out today that is 'coonery buffoonery'."&lt;ref name="Our World"&gt;{{cite video|title=Our World with Black Enterprise |date=May 31, 2009 |url=http://www.blackenterprise.com/tv-video/our-world/full-episode-our-world-with-black-enterprise-tv-video/2009/05/30/our-world-episode-73/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106194319/http://www.blackenterprise.com/tv-video/our-world/full-episode-our-world-with-black-enterprise-tv-video/2009/05/30/our-world-episode-73 |archivedate=January 6, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked if Perry's success among black audiences was a result of just giving black America what they wanted, Lee responded, "the imaging is troubling."

In an open letter to Perry on [[National Public Radio]], journalist [[Jamilah Lemieux]], while thanking Perry for "giving black folks jobs in front of and behind the camera," also criticized his shows ''[[Meet the Browns (TV series)|Meet the Browns]]'' and ''[[House of Payne]]''. In her letter, she stated that "both your shows are marked by old stereotypes of buffoonish, emasculated black men and crass, sassy black women." While she noted his work for its humor and "positive messages of self-worth, love and respect," she later expressed frustration that African-Americans "have been fed the same images of ourselves over and over and over because they sell." Lemieux dismissed his famous Madea character, claiming that "Through her, the country has laughed at one of the most important members of the black community: Mother Dear, the beloved matriarch. ... Our mothers and grandmothers deserve much more than that." While she expressed appreciation toward Perry for dismissing critics' negative comments, Lemieux claimed that "many black folks have expressed some of the very same attitudes about your work that white critics have," and urged him to "stop dismissing the critics as haters and realize that black people need new stories and new storytellers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=An Open Letter to Tyler Perry|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=112760404|date=September 11, 2009|accessdate=29 March 2013|newspaper=National Public Radio}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Response====
In October 2009, during a ''[[60 Minutes]]'' interview, Perry was read a quote of [[Spike Lee]]'s comments about his work and responded, "I would love to read that [criticism] to my fan base. ... That pisses me off. It is so insulting. It's attitudes like that that make Hollywood think that these people do not exist, and that is why there is no material speaking to them, speaking to us." Perry also stated that "all these characters are bait&amp;nbsp;– disarming, charming, make-you-laugh bait. I can slap Madea on something and talk about God, love, faith, forgiveness, family, any of those."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=60 Minutes: Tyler Perry's Amazing Journey to the Top|date=October 25, 2009|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/10/22/60minutes/main5410095.shtml |publisher=CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with Hip Hollywood, Perry responded to Spike Lee's comments by telling him to "go to hell."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tyler Perry Tells Spike Lee to "Go To Hell!"|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOnY6cx-nBI|date=April 20, 2011|accessdate=29 March 2013|newspaper=Hip Hollywood}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acclaim===

Perry's work has been praised by [[Oprah Winfrey]], who joined Perry in promoting [[Lee Daniels]]' film ''[[Precious (film)|Precious]]'' (2009). She told an interviewer, "I think [Perry] grew up being raised by strong, black women. And so much of what he does is really in celebration of that. I think that's what Madea really is: a compilation of all those strong black women that I know and maybe you do too? And so the reason it works is because people see themselves."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/movies/2009/10/26/2009-10-26_tyler_perry_responds_to_spike_lees_claim_that_his_work_is_comparable_to_amos_n_a.html#ixzz0j7BuSSil| title=Tyler Perry responds to Spike Lee's claim that his work is comparable to 'Amos 'n' Andy'|author=Issie Lapowsky |work=Daily News|date=October 26, 2009 | location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Goldie Taylor]], of [[The Grio]] and [[MSNBC]], stated in an April 21, 2011 [[National Public Radio|NPR]] ''[[All Things Considered]]'' interview regarding Perry's target audience: "I don't think Tyler Perry is talking to [[Touré]]. I don't think he's talking to me, but I know that he's speaking directly to my mother, my sister, my cousins and meeting them at their point of need, and that's what art and filmmaking is about."&lt;ref name="npr.org"&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/04/21/135610190/war-of-words-tyler-perry-vs-spike-lee?ps=rs |title='&amp;#39;All Things Considered'&amp;#39; "War of Words: Tyler Perry Vs.

In his ''Huffington Post'' editorial, sociologist Shayne Lee lists Perry among the pantheon of today's most innovative filmmakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/shayne-lee/tyler-perrys-movie-milest_b_6604704.html?ir=Black+Voices|title=Tyler Perry's Movie Milestone|author=|date=|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=September 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parodies and satire===

In the ''[[American Dad!]]'' episode "[[American Dad! (season 9)|Spelling Bee My Baby]]", [[Steve Smith (American Dad!)|Steve Smith]] deliberately misspelled his words in a [[spelling bee]] so as to express his love for [[Barry Robinson (American Dad!)|Akiko]] (who was also competing), instead spelling random Tyler Perry and Madea films.&lt;ref name="avclub6"&gt;{{cite web|last=McFarland |first=Kevin |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/the-full-cognitive-redaction-of-avery-bullock-by-t,96582/ |title="The Full Cognitive Redaction of Avery Bullock by the Coward Stan Smith" &amp;#124; American Dad &amp;#124; TV Club &amp;#124; TV |publisher=The A.V. Club |date=April 29, 2013 |accessdate=May 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perry was satirized by ''[[South Park]]'' in the Season Fifteen episode "[[Funnybot]]". He was given an award for "Comedian Most likely to turn up to collect their comedy award", and the black characters in the episode, [[Token (South Park character)|Token Black]] and [[Barack Obama|President Obama]], express their own disbelief that they can't stop watching his comedy and giving him money. At the end of the episode Perry, as Madea, is buried and encased in steel with Obama's declaring, "I am pleased to announce that the greatest threat to mankind has now gone forever. Justice has been done."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Kate | last = Ward | title = New 'South Park' references death of Osama bin Laden | date = May 4, 2011 |url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2011/05/04/south-park-bin-laden/ |work=Entertainment Weekly | accessdate =May 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tyler Perry as Madea was parodied in ''[[The Boondocks (TV series)|The Boondocks]]'' episode "[[Pause (The Boondocks)|Pause]]", in which a thinly disguised version of Perry named Winston Jerome played a similar character to Madea dubbed "Ma Dukes." The parody had the "Ma Duke" character running a homosexual cult.&lt;ref name="braxton"&gt;{{Cite news  | last = Braxton  | first = Greg  | title = Aaron McGruder's Boondocks' lampoons Tyler Perry  | newspaper = [[The Los Angeles Times]]  | date = June 21, 2010  |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-boondocks-20100622,0,7842614.story  | accessdate = June 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
