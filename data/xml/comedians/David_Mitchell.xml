==Early life==
Mitchell was born in [[Salisbury]], [[Wiltshire]], England, to Ian Douglas Mitchell and Kathryn Grey Mitchell (née Hughes),&lt;ref name=whowho/&gt; who then worked as hotel managers. In 1977, when Mitchell was two years old, his parents gave up their jobs to lecture in hotel management, and to look after him.&lt;ref name=ds/&gt; He attended Napier House Primary School.&lt;ref name=mailbio&gt;{{cite news |last=Lewis |first=Simon |title=So what was my big secret?

In a 2006 interview with ''[[The Independent]]'', Mitchell stated his childhood dreams:
{{bq|text=When I was at school I either wanted to be a comedian-stroke-actor or [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister]]. But I didn't admit that to other people, I said I wanted to be a [[barrister]] and that made my parents very happy. I didn't admit I wanted to be a comedian until I came to university, met a lot of other people who wanted to be comedians, and realised it was an okay thing to say.&lt;ref name=Independent&gt;{{cite news|last=Ross |first=Deborah |url=http://news.independent.co.uk/people/profiles/article1988496.ece |title=Peep Show's David Mitchell and Robert Webb |date=18 November 2006 |accessdate=4 April 2007 |publisher=''The Independent'' |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001083236/http://news.independent.co.uk/people/profiles/article1988496.ece |archivedate=1 October 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Abingdon School, Abingdon, Oxfordshire, England-23April2011.jpg|thumb|left|[[Abingdon School]]]]

From the age of thirteen, Mitchell was educated at [[Abingdon School]], a [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public school]] in Oxfordshire. Having always been top of the class at Primary school and Prep school, once he moved to [[Abingdon-on-Thames|Abingdon]], he realised that there were plenty of people more intelligent than he was, so he turned his attention to debating and drama, "where [he] had a chance of being the best".&lt;ref name=timesinter/&gt; There, Mitchell often took part in plays, "largely because you got to play cards backstage."&lt;ref name=Independent/&gt; His roles mainly consisted of small minute-long parts, until he won the role of [[Rabbit (Winnie-the-Pooh)|Rabbit]] in ''[[Winnie-the-Pooh]]''. This was the first time that he was "consciously aware I was doing a performance" and that that "was better, even, than playing cards."&lt;ref name=Independent/&gt; Mitchell had been "obsessed" with comedy writing since his school days, as he "always felt that doing a joke was the cleverest thing", and "would intrinsically prefer a parody of something to the actual thing itself".&lt;ref name=inter&gt;{{cite web|last=Richman |first=Darren |url=http://www.wessexscene.co.uk/article.php?sid=1011 |title=David 'peep show' Mitchell Interview |date=7 March 2005 |accessdate=17 March 2007 |publisher=''Wessex Scene'' |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061004003828/http://www.wessexscene.co.uk/article.php?sid=1011 |archivedate=4 October 2006 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
Rejected by [[Merton College, Oxford|Merton College]], [[University of Oxford]],&lt;ref name=mailbio/&gt;{{sfn|Mitchell|2012|page=131}} in 1993, Mitchell went up to [[Peterhouse, Cambridge]], where he studied modern history.&lt;ref name=ds/&gt; There, he began performing with the Cambridge [[Footlights]], of which he became President&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/thatmitchellandwebbsite/cast/mitchell.shtml |title=David Mitchell |publisher=BBC |accessdate=17 March 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070210003323/http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/thatmitchellandwebbsite/cast/mitchell.shtml |archivedate=10 February 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; for the 1995–96 academic year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://footlights.org/alumni-archive?name=1990-1999 |title=Footlight alumni 1990–1999 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015035204/http://footlights.org/alumni-archive?name=1990-1999 |archivedate=15 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mitchell was in his first year at university when he met [[Robert Webb]] during rehearsals for a Footlights production of ''[[Cinderella]]'', in 1993, and the two men soon established a comedy partnership.&lt;ref name=theobserver&gt;{{cite news |url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/magazine/story/0,,1856420,00.html |last=Mitchell |first=Ben |title=Masters of comedy |date=27 August 2006 |accessdate=28 April 2007 |work=[[The Observer]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313121826/http://observer.guardian.co.uk/magazine/story/0,,1856420,00.html |archivedate=13 March 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mitchell, these factors had a detrimental effect on his academic performance at university and he attained a [[Lower second-class honours|2:2]] in his final exams.&lt;ref name=inter/&gt;

==Career==

===Early work and ''Peep Show''===
Before his break into comedy, Mitchell worked as an usher at the [[Lyric Hammersmith]] theatre,&lt;ref name=ddailymail&gt;{{cite news |last=Fryer |first=Jane |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/showbiz/showbiznews.html?in_article_id=489764&amp;in_page_id=1773 |title=Who are Mitchell &amp; Webb? |accessdate=3 November 2007 |date=25 October 2007 |publisher=''[[Daily Mail]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the cloakroom of ''[[TFI Friday]]'' among other jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=Mitchell, David |date=2 November 2007 |title=The Big Fat Anniversary Quiz |medium=Television production |publisher=[[Channel 4]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mitchell's first project with Webb was in January 1995, a show about a nuclear apocalypse&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast |url=http://asitecalledfred.com/2012/06/26/david-mitchell-ken-plume-chat-3/ |title=A Bit of a Chat With Ken Plume &amp; David Mitchell 3 |website=FRED Entertainment |host=Ken Plume |date=26 June 2012 |time=1:23:23 |accessdate=8 August 2013 |quote='Innocent Millions Dead or Dying' ... which wasn't actually about the first world war, that's what they put on Wikipedia ... it was about a nuclear apocalypse. |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130430154935/http://asitecalledfred.com/2012/06/26/david-mitchell-ken-plume-chat-3/ |archivedate=30 April 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; entitled ''Innocent Millions Dead or Dying: A Wry Look at the Post-Apocalyptic Age''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.varsity.co.uk/arts/871 |title=That Mitchell and Webb interview |work=Varsity |date=22 February 2008 |accessdate=24 January 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928064008/http://www.varsity.co.uk/arts/871 |archivedate=28 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Webb later described it as being "fucking terrible".&lt;ref name=theobserver/&gt; After leaving university he and Webb began performing a number of two-man shows at the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe|Edinburgh Fringe]].&lt;ref name=inter/&gt;

As a result of their performances at the Edinburgh Fringe, the duo were given the chance to write for [[Alexander Armstrong (comedian)|Alexander Armstrong]] and [[Ben Miller]] and for series two of ''[[Big Train]]''.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; After minor work on ''[[The Jack Docherty Show]]'' and ''[[Comedy Nation]]'',&lt;ref name=media100/&gt; their first break into television acting was in 2000, on the short-lived BBC sketch show ''[[Bruiser (TV series)|Bruiser]]'', which they primarily wrote, and starred in. The show also featured three time BAFTA winner [[Olivia Colman]], who would become a regular cast member of Mitchell and Webb projects, and [[Martin Freeman]], later of ''[[The Office (UK TV series)|The Office]]'' fame. Other cast members included [[Matthew Holness]] and [[Charlotte Hudson]]. Additional material for the show was provided by various people, including [[Ricky Gervais]] and [[James Bachman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lewisohn |first=Mark |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/guide/articles/b/bruiser_66600740.shtml |title=Bruiser |accessdate=4 April 2007 |publisher=BBC |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070214133616/http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/guide/articles/b/bruiser_66600740.shtml |archivedate=14 February 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 the two men were commissioned for a sketch show of their own, entitled ''[[The Mitchell and Webb Situation]]'', which ran for six episodes on the now defunct channel [[Play UK]].&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; The show was reasonably well received. ''Wessex Scene''{{'}}s Darren Richman said "what the series lacked in budget, it made up for in magnificent material" and went on to call it "far superior to the vastly overrated ''[[Little Britain]]''" and "perhaps the greatest forgotten sketch show of modern times."&lt;ref name=inter/&gt; ''Eureka! TV'', which released ''The Mitchell and Webb Situation'' on DVD in 2005, said that the show "gushes forth an hilarious stream of surreal and quirkily inventive sketches", as well as calling it a "cult success".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurekavideo.co.uk/tv/the-mitchell-webb-situation/ |title=The Mitchell &amp; Webb Situation |accessdate=4 April 2007 |publisher=Eureka!

In a 2007 interview with Digital Spy, Mitchell stated that he enjoyed panel shows, as they are "a game worth playing".&lt;ref name=ds/&gt; He then further explained his appreciation of the panel format in response to criticism from ''Fast Show'' co-creator Charlie Higson, who stated in September 2013 that panel comedies were overtaking television programming at the expense of sketch shows and sitcoms:
{{bq|text=
There was a quote from Catherine Zeta-Jones about playing golf with her husband Michael Douglas. We essentially all started to imagine the scene of the two of them playing golf and that was very enjoyable and turned into a really fun bit of TV. It is moments like that which, for me, justify the existence of panel shows because no-one would ever have written those words. It purely came out of that combination of people which proves panel shows can produce funny TV in a way you could never write into a sitcom or a sketch show and thereby justifies its place on screen. I think it is a great form of entertainment and we shouldn't lose sight of that.&lt;ref name="Adam" /&gt;}}

The ''[[Radio Times]]'' named him "The Best Comedy Panel Show Guest" in the world, stating that "he's incredibly, disgustingly witty" and "even starting to make [[Paul Merton]] look slow on the uptake".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/content/show-features/peep-show/the-best-comedy-panel-show-guest/ |title=The Best…Comedy Panel Show Guest |accessdate=5 May 2007 |publisher=''Radio Times'' |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070527141810/http://www.radiotimes.com/content/show-features/peep-show/the-best-comedy-panel-show-guest/ |archivedate=27 May 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his BAFTA win, Mitchell was ranked at No. 53 in the 2009 MediaGuardian 100, an annual ranking of media people in ''The Guardian''.
