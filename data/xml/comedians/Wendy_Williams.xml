'''Wendy Joan Williams-Hunter''' (born '''Wendy Joan Williams'''; July 18, 1964)&lt;ref name="Wendy Williams.Biography"/&gt; is an American television host, actress, author, fashion designer, and former radio personality. She has hosted the [[broadcast syndication|nationally syndicated]] television talk show ''[[The Wendy Williams Show]]'' since 2008.

Prior to television, Williams was a radio DJ and host and quickly became known in New York as a "[[shock jock]]ette". She gained notoriety for her on-air spats with celebrities and was the subject of the 2006 [[VH1]] reality TV series ''[[The Wendy Williams Experience]]'' which broadcast events surrounding her radio show. She was inducted into the [[National Radio Hall of Fame]] in 2009.

She has written a [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' best-selling]] autobiography and six other books, and has created various product lines including a fashion line, a jewelry collection and a wig line. On her 50th birthday, the council of [[Asbury Park#Notable people|Asbury Park]] renamed the street on which she grew up to Wendy Williams Way.

==Early life==
Williams was born on July 18, 1964, in [[Ocean Township, Monmouth County, New Jersey]], a suburb of [[Asbury Park, New Jersey|Asbury Park]].&lt;ref name="Wendy Williams.Biography"&gt;{{cite web |title=Wendy Williams Biography| url=http://www.biography.com/people/wendy-williams-524056|accessdate=May 14, 2013| journal=biography.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is the second of three children born to parents Thomas and Shirley Williams.&lt;ref name="Wendy Williams.Biography"/&gt; She grew up in the Wayside section of Ocean Township.&lt;ref name=NYmagProfile&gt;[http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/people/features/14790/index1.html "How New York's Shock Jockette Got Supersized"], ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'', October 16, 2005, Accessed September 18, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Williams graduated from [[Ocean Township High School]]&lt;ref name=NJMonthly&gt;Neglia, Ashley V.

==Career==
===Radio===
Williams began her career working for [[WVIS]] in the [[United States Virgin Islands]].&lt;ref name="vibe2003"/&gt; Less than a year later, she obtained an afternoon position at [[Washington, D.C.]]-based station [[WOL (AM)|WOL]]. Williams commuted between DC and [[Queens, New York]], to work an overnight weekend shift at [[WQHT]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/how-wendy-williams-got-her-start-2013-6|title=Every College Grad Should Hear Wendy Williams' Story About Struggling To Make It Big|accessdate=June 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, Williams began at [[urban contemporary]] WRKS (now [[WEPN-FM]]) in New York City as a substitute disc jockey. WRKS hired her full-time for its morning show. A year later, Williams moved to an afternoon drive-time shift, eventually winning the ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' Award for "Best On-Air Radio Personality" in 1993.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} In December 1994, [[Emmis Broadcasting]] purchased WRKS and switched Williams to the company's other New York property, hip-hop formatted [[WQHT]] ("Hot 97"), as WRKS was reformatted into an [[urban adult contemporary]] outlet. She was fired from Hot 97 in 1998.&lt;ref name=NYmagProfile/&gt;

Williams was hired by a Philadelphia urban station, [[WUSL]] ("Power 99FM"). Her husband, Kevin Hunter, became her agent.&lt;ref name=NYmagProfile/&gt; She was very open about her personal life on air, discussing her miscarriages, breast enhancement surgery&lt;ref name=NYmagProfile/&gt; and former drug addiction.&lt;ref name="vibe2003"/&gt; She helped the station move from 14th place in the ratings to 2nd.&lt;ref name=NYmagProfile/&gt;

Williams has stated that [[Bill Cosby]] attempted to get her fired in 1991 and 1992. She also believes that [[Bill Cosby sexual assault allegations|Cosby is guilty of sexual assault]].&lt;ref name="EURweb 2017"&gt;{{cite web | title=Wendy Williams Reveals Bill Cosby Tried to Get Her Fired...

In 2001, Williams returned to the New York airwaves when WBLS hired her full-time for a syndicated 2–6 p.m. time slot. Williams' friend, MC Spice of Boston, offered his voiceover services to the show, often adding short rap verses tailored specifically for Williams' show. ''The New York Times'' stated that her "show works best when its elements – confessional paired with snarkiness – are conflated," and cited a 2003 interview with [[Whitney Houston]] as an example.&lt;ref name="NYT2008"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/13/arts/television/13drak.html?_r=0|title=TELEVISION; A Radio Shock Jock Who's Ready for TV|last=Drake|first=Monica|date=July 13, 2008|work=The New York Times|page=17|accessdate=April 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the highly publicized interview&lt;ref name="FOX"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,389263,00.html|title=Omarosa: Wendy Williams a 'Fake and a Phony' |work=[[Fox News Channel]]|accessdate=April 15, 2013|date=July 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; that "went haywire" and included "a lot of bleeped language", Williams "asked [Houston], insistently, about her drug and spending habits".&lt;ref name="Stanley2008"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/22/arts/television/22stan.html|title=Talk Show Is Less Talk, More Alpha-Female Action |author=Alessandra Stanley |date=July 22, 2008 |work=The New York Times|accessdate=April 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2008, she was syndicated in [[Redondo Beach, California]]; [[Shreveport, Louisiana]]; [[Wilmington, Delaware]]; [[Toledo, Ohio]]; [[Columbia, South Carolina]]; [[Emporia, Virginia]]; [[Lake Charles, Louisiana]]; [[Tyler, Texas]]; and [[Alexandria, Louisiana]], among other markets.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Williams left her radio show in 2009 to focus on her television program and spend more time with her family. She was inducted into the [[National Radio Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref name="Hall of fame"&gt;{{cite web|title=National Radio Hall of Fame: Wendy Williams, Talkshow Host|url=http://www.radiohof.org/talkshowhost/wendywilliams.html|access-date=December 25, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091218105840/http://www.radiohof.org/talkshowhost/wendywilliams.html|archive-date=December 18, 2009|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, [[Debmar-Mercury]] offered Williams a six-week television trial of her own talk show. On July 14, 2008, Williams debuted her daytime talk show, ''[[The Wendy Williams Show]]'', in four cities during the summer of 2008. During the tryout, ''[[The New York Times]]'' snarkily remarked that the show created a "breakthrough in daytime" by introducing the genre of the "backtalk show.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Stanley |first=Alessandra |date=July 22, 2008 |title=Talk Show Is Less Talk, More Alpha-Female Action |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/22/arts/television/22stan.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=September 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a successful run, [[Fox Television Stations|Fox]] signed a deal with Debmar-Mercury to broadcast the show nationally on their stations beginning in July 2009. In addition, [[BET]] picked up cable rights to broadcast the show at night. In 2010, BET started airing the show internationally in 54 countries through [[BET International]].&lt;ref&gt;
