'''Greg Warren''' &lt;!---can't find sources to confirm birthdate, if you find one that's not a Wikipedia mirror, please add it ^_^ (born June 20, 1978)---&gt; is an [[United States|American]] [[stand-up comic]] from St Louis, Missouri.

== Early years ==
Warren was raised in [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. His father was a high school wrestling coach and his mother made him play clarinet in the band. Greg incorporates these personae into his comedy routines, highlighting the conflict inherent in being both a varsity wrestler and band geek. In Greg's "Flute Man" bit, in which he discusses the insecurities of high school and the ongoing quest to be cool, is one of the most-requested bits in the history of the "Bob and Tom" radio show.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bobandtom.com/2014/10/06/guests-for-the-week-of-october-6/|title=Guests for the Week of October 6|date=2014-10-06|work=The BOB &amp; TOM Show|access-date=2018-04-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greg was also a [[United States Military Academy|West Point cadet]].  Later, he transferred to the [[University of Missouri]], where he studied journalism and was named an All-American college wrestler with a 7th-place finish at the 1991 [[NCAA]] Division 1 Wrestling Championships.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Daily Record (Washington)|Daily Record]]'' (Ellensburg, Wash.). [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=860&amp;dat=19910318&amp;id=tuoxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=BI8DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6245,1786777 "Scoreboard - Wrestling"]. March 18, 1991, p. 11. Retrieved on August 9, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early career ==
While in college, Greg won a comedy contest and was invited to perform at a local club in Columbia, Missouri, Dèjà Vu. After a stint selling [[Pringles]] for corporate giant [[Procter &amp; Gamble]], Greg made the decision to pursue a full-time career in comedy. This led to an invitation to the "Just for Laughs Festival" in [[Montreal]] in 2002, where he performed as one of their featured "New Faces of Comedy".[http://stressfactorycomedyclub.laughstub.com/event.cfm?id=451656]

== Work ==
Warren has appeared on the [[Comedy Central]] show, "Premium Blend".  He has an arsenal of characters that he brings to life in his act. He also highlights his current life struggles with the service industry, moderation, and "One Star People".

He also tours the country, performing his act at clubs such as the Funny Bone and the Improv and is a frequent guest on the Bob and Tom Radio Show and a featured guest every Wednesday on [[Pittsburgh]]'s ''[[The DVE Morning Show|Randy Baumann and the DVE Morning Show]]''.  His background recently resulted in a gig doing color commentary on college wrestling for Fox Sports Midwest. His Midwestern upbringing and his ability to provide humorous social commentary give him a wealth of material.

In August 2004 Warren released his self-produced comedy [[Compact disc|CD]], ''[[Hit 'Em With Your Flute (album)|Hit 'Em With Your Flute]]''.

Warren has appeared on [[CMT Comedy Stage]], on NBC's [[Last Comic Standing]] and CBS's [[The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson]].  He had his own [[Comedy Central Presents]] and will be releasing a digital album under [[Comedy Central Records]].
