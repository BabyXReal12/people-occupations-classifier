White's family moved to [[Alhambra, California]] and later to Los Angeles, during the [[Great Depression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jacobs|first=Matthew|title=Betty White's 91st Birthday: 10 Facts About America's Golden Girl|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/17/betty-white-birthday-facts_n_2489755.html|accessdate=October 25, 2013|newspaper=The Huffington Post|date=January 17, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111011652/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/17/betty-white-birthday-facts_n_2489755.html |archivedate=November 11, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SNL2010"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Betty White|series=Saturday Night Live|serieslink=Saturday Night Live|network=NBC|date=May 8, 2010|season=35|number=679}}&lt;/ref&gt; To make extra money, her father would build radios and sell them wherever he could.

She attended [[Horace Mann School Beverly Hills]] and [[Beverly Hills High School]], famously used as a filming location for popular titles such as ''[[Clueless (film)|Clueless]]'' and ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tony|first=Reeves|title=The Worldwide Guide to Movie Locations|year=2006|publisher=Titan Books|location=London|isbn=978-1-84023-992-8|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; where she was a member of the 1939 graduating class. Her interest in wildlife was sparked by family vacations to the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|High Sierras]].

==Entertainment career==
===1940s===
White made rounds to movie studios looking for work, but was always turned down because she was "unphotogenic". So then she started to look for radio jobs where being photogenic did not matter. Her first radio jobs included reading commercials and playing bit parts, and sometimes even doing crowd noises. She made about five dollars a show. She would do just about anything, like singing on a show for no money, or making an appearance on the local game show.&lt;ref name="O'Dell, C. 1997"/&gt;

White began her television career in 1939, three months after high school graduation, when she and a classmate sang songs from ''[[The Merry Widow]]'' on an [[History of television#United States|experimental Los Angeles channel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=France|first=Lisa Respers|title=Cool Betty White is red-hot|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/SHOWBIZ/02/09/betty.white.super.bowl/index.html?hpt=C2|accessdate=October 13, 2013|newspaper=[[CNN]]|date=February 9, 2010|quote=According to an oral history interview White conducted in 1994 for the Archive of American Television, she broke into the business three months after graduating from Beverly Hills High School in 1938 at an early age, as part of an experimental television show.|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150119043320/http://edition.cnn.com/2010/SHOWBIZ/02/09/betty.white.super.bowl/index.html?hpt=C2|archivedate=January 19, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{r|aatinterview}}&lt;ref name="oneil20100617"&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Neil|first=Tom|title=Betty White reflects on a golden career|url=http://goldderby.latimes.com/awards_goldderby/2010/06/betty-white-reflects-on-a-golden-career-.html|accessdate=October 13, 2013|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=June 17, 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005232746/http://goldderby.latimes.com/awards_goldderby/2010/06/betty-white-reflects-on-a-golden-career-.html|archivedate=October 5, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; White found work modeling, and her first professional acting job was at the Bliss Hayden Little Theatre. White's career was disrupted immediately, as World War II broke out, causing her to join the [[American Women's Voluntary Services]].

In the 1940s, she worked in radio, appearing on shows such as ''[[Blondie (radio)|Blondie]]'', ''[[The Great Gildersleeve]]'', and ''[[This is Your FBI]]''. She then got her own radio show, called ''The Betty White Show''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Betty White honored with 2009 Screen Actors Guild Lifetime Achievement Award|url=http://www.sagawards.org/media-pr/press-releases/betty-white-honored-2009-screen-actors-guild-lifetime-achievement-award|accessdate=October 13, 2013|newspaper=[[Screen Actors Guild Awards]]|date=January 23, 2010|location=Los Angeles|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150119041325/http://www.sagawards.org/media-pr/press-releases/betty-white-honored-2009-screen-actors-guild-lifetime-achievement-award|archivedate=January 19, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1949, she began appearing as co-host with Al Jarvis on his daily [[live television]] variety show ''[[Hollywood on Television]]'', originally called ''Al Jarvis' Make-Believe Ballroom'' on [[KFWB|KFWB radio]] and on [[KCOP-TV|KLAC-TV]] in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=thr&gt;{{cite news|first=Gregg|last=Kilday|title=Betty White to receive SAG lifetime award|url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/286269|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=|date=September 15, 2009|accessdate=October 5, 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100426094225/http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/286269|archivedate=April 26, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oneil20100617"/&gt;

===1950s===
White began hosting the show by herself in 1952 after Jarvis' departure,&lt;ref name=thr/&gt; spanning five and a half hours of live [[ad-lib]] television six days per week over a contiguous four-year span altogether. In all of her various variety series over the years, White would sing at least a couple of songs during each broadcast. In 1951, she was nominated for her first [[Emmy Award]] as "Best Actress" on television, competing with such legendary stars as [[Judith Anderson]], [[Helen Hayes]], and [[Imogene Coca]] (the award went to [[Gertrude Berg]]). This was the very first award and category in the new Emmy history designated for women on television.

[[File:Betty White in The Betty White Show 1954 (2).jpg|thumb|left|White in 1954]]
In 1952, the same year that she began hosting ''Hollywood on Television'', White co-founded Bandy Productions with writer [[George Tibbles]] and [[Don Fedderson]], a producer.&lt;ref name=thr/&gt; The trio worked to create new shows using existing characters from sketches shown on ''Hollywood on Television''. White, Fedderson, and Tibbles created the [[television comedy]] ''[[Life with Elizabeth]]'', with White portraying the [[title role]].&lt;ref name=thr/&gt; The show was originally a live production on [[KLAC-TV]] in 1951, and won White a [[Los Angeles Emmy Award|Regional Los Angeles Emmy]] in 1952.&lt;ref name=thr/&gt;&lt;ref name=shemadeit/&gt;&lt;ref name="oneil20100617"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gomes|first1=Patrick|title=Betty White Remembers Her First Emmys - in 1951!|url=http://www.peoplestylewatch.com/people/stylewatch/package/article/0,,20840501_20846506,00.html|accessdate=November 10, 2015|work=People|date=September 3, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117033527/http://www.peoplestylewatch.com/people/stylewatch/package/article/0,,20840501_20846506,00.html|archivedate=November 17, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Life with Elizabeth'' was nationally [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] from 1952 to 1955, allowing White to become one of the few women in television with full creative control in front of and behind the camera.&lt;ref name=thr/&gt; The show was unusual for a sitcom in the 1950s because it was co-produced and owned by a twenty-eight-year-old woman who still lived with her parents. White said they didn't worry about relevance in those days, and that usually the incidents were based on real life situations that happened to her, the actor who played Alvin, and the writer.&lt;ref name="O'Dell, C. 1997"/&gt;

In 1954, she briefly hosted and produced her own daily talk show, ''The Betty White Show'', on [[NBC]] (not to be confused with her 1970s sitcom of the same name).&lt;ref name=thr/&gt; 
In 1956, she was the guest star on "[[The Millionaire (TV series)|The Millionaire]]" in the episode "The Virginia Lennart Story", as the owner of a small town diner that received an anonymous gift of $1,000,000.
Following ''Life with Elizabeth'', she appeared as Vicki Angel on the sitcom ''[[Date with the Angels]]'' from 1957 to 1958. The show later became another variety series before going off the air.&lt;ref name=thr/&gt; White performed in [[commercials]] seen on live television in Los Angeles, including a rendition of the "Dr. Ross Dog Food" advertisement at [[KTLA]] during the 1950s.

===1960s===
She made her feature film debut as Kansas Senator Elizabeth Ames Adams in the 1962 drama, ''[[Advise &amp; Consent (film)|Advise &amp; Consent]]''. Although her performance was well received, it would be her only big-screen appearance for decades.

Through the 1950s and 1960s, White began a nineteen-year run as hostess and commentator on the annual [[Tournament of Roses Parade]] broadcast on NBC (often co-hosting with [[Lorne Greene]]), and appeared on a number of late night talk shows and daytime game shows.&lt;ref name=thr /&gt; White made many appearances on the hit game show ''[[Password (game show)|Password]]'' as a celebrity guest from 1961 through 1975. She married the show's host, [[Allen Ludden]], in 1963.&lt;ref name=thr/&gt; She subsequently appeared on the show's three updated versions ''Password Plus'', ''Super Password'', and ''Million Dollar Password'', having been on versions of the game with five different hosts (Allen Ludden, [[Bill Cullen]], [[Tom Kennedy (television presenter)|Tom Kennedy]], [[Bert Convy]], and [[Regis Philbin]]). White made frequent game show appearances on ''[[What's My Line?]]'' (starting in 1955), ''[[To Tell the Truth]]'' (in 1961, 1990, and 2015), ''[[I've Got a Secret]]'' (in 1972â€“73), ''Match Game'' (1973â€“1982), and ''[[Pyramid (game show)|Pyramid]]'' (starting in 1982). Both ''Password'' and ''Pyramid'' were created by White's friend, [[Bob Stewart (television producer)|Bob Stewart]].

===1970s===
[[File:Betty White Sue Ann Nivens 1973.JPG|thumb|right|White as Sue Ann Nivens in ''The Mary Tyler Moore Show'']]
In 1973, White made several [[guest appearance]]s in the fourth season of the CBS sitcom ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]''.&lt;ref name=thr/&gt; As a result of this appearance, she landed the regular role of the sardonic, man-hungry [[Sue Ann Nivens]], "The Happy Homemaker", on the show.&lt;ref name=thr/&gt; White would receive her second and third Emmys from her part on ''The Mary Tyler Moore Show''. White considers her part as Sue Ann in the show one of the highlights of her professional career, but she describes her television image as "icky sweet." She felt that she was the very definition of feminine passivity, owing to the fact that White always seemed willing to satirize her own unique persona on screen in just such a way.&lt;ref name="O'Dell, C. 1997"/&gt;

A [[running gag]] was that Sue Ann's hard-edged private personality was the complete opposite of how she presented herself on her show. "We need somebody who can play sickeningly sweet, like Betty White," Moore herself suggested at a production meeting, which resulted in casting White herself. White won two Emmy Awards back-to-back for her role in the hugely popular series.&lt;ref name=thr/&gt;

In 1975, NBC replaced her as hostess and commentator on the Tournament of Roses Parade broadcast feeling she was too identified with rival network CBS due to her new found success on ''The Mary Tyler Moore Show''. White admitted to [[People (magazine)|''People'' magazine]] it was difficult "watching someone else do my parade",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Windeler|first=Robert|title=MTM Is Ending and Stumpers Is Dumped, but Betty White &amp; Allen Ludden Still Have Each Other|journal=People|date=December 20, 1976|volume=6|issue=25|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20067239,00.html|accessdate=January 18, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021085529/http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20067239,00.html|archivedate=October 21, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; although she soon would start a ten-year run as hostess of the [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]] for CBS.

Following the end of ''The Mary Tyler Moore Show'' in 1977, White got her own sitcom on CBS, her second series entitled ''The Betty White Show''&lt;ref name=thr/&gt; (the first having been broadcast a quarter century earlier), during the 1977â€“78 season, in which she co-starred with [[John Hillerman]] and former ''Mary Tyler Moore'' co-star [[Georgia Engel]]. It was canceled after one season.

White appeared several times on'' [[The Carol Burnett Show]]'' and ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' appearing in many sketches, and began guest-starring in a number of television movies and television miniseries, including ''[[With This Ring (TV series)|With This Ring]]'', ''The Best Place to Be'', ''Before and After'', and ''The Gossip Columnist''.&lt;ref name=thr/&gt;

===1980s===
In 1983, she became the first woman to win a [[Daytime Emmy Award]] in the category of Outstanding Game Show Host, for the NBC entry ''[[Just Men!]]''.&lt;ref name=VanityFair&gt;"It's Evening in America". ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]''. May 2012. Page 157.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the amount of work she has done on them, she has been deemed the "First Lady of Game Shows".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Conradt|first=Stacy|title=10 reasons we love Betty White|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/LIVING/worklife/02/23/mf.betty.white.why.love/|accessdate=October 25, 2013|newspaper=CNN|date=February 23, 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029203856/http://edition.cnn.com/2010/LIVING/worklife/02/23/mf.betty.white.why.love/|archivedate=October 29, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Golden Girls cast miami song.jpg|thumb|left|The cast of The Golden Girls: (from left) Estelle Getty, Rue McClanahan, Betty White, and Bea Arthur]]

From 1983-1984, she had a recurring role playing [[Ellen Harper|Ellen Harper Jackson]] on the series ''[[Mama's Family]]'',&lt;ref name=thr/&gt; along with future ''[[Golden Girls]]'' co-star Rue McClanahan. White had originated this character in a series of sketches on ''The Carol Burnett Show'' in the 1970s. When ''Mama's Family'' was picked up in [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] after being canceled by NBC in 1984, White left the show (with the exception of one final appearance in the show's [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] version in 1986).

In 1985, White scored her second signature role and the biggest hit of her career as the [[Rose Nylund#St. Olaf|St. Olaf, Minnesota]]-native [[Rose Nylund]] on ''The Golden Girls''.&lt;ref name=thr/&gt; The series chronicled the lives of four widowed or divorced women in their "golden years" who shared a home in Miami. ''The Golden Girls'', which also starred [[Bea Arthur]], [[Estelle Getty]], and [[Rue McClanahan]], was immensely successful and ran from 1985 through 1992. White won one Emmy Award, for ''Outstanding Actress in a Comedy Series'', for the first season of ''The Golden Girls''&lt;ref name=thr/&gt; and was nominated in that category every year of the show's run (the only cast member to receive that distinction â€“ Getty was also nominated every year, but in the supporting actress category).

White was originally offered the role of Blanche in ''The Golden Girls,'' and Rue McClanahan was offered the role of Rose (the two characters being similar to roles they had played in ''Mary Tyler Moore'' and ''[[Maude (TV series)|Maude]]'', respectively). [[Jay Sandrich]], the director of the pilot, suggested that since they had played similar roles in the past, they should switch roles, Rue McClanahan later said in a documentary on the series. White originally had doubts about her ability to play Rose, until the show's creator took her aside and told her not to play Rose as stupid but as someone "terminally naive, a person who always believed the first explanation of something."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Seven Things You Didnâ€™t Know About Birthday Girl Betty White|url=http://radaronline.com/exclusives/2012/01/betty-white-birthday-90-seven-things/|accessdate=February 11, 2016|publisher=radar|date=January 17, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160216004959/http://radaronline.com/exclusives/2012/01/betty-white-birthday-90-seven-things/|archivedate=February 16, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990s===
The show ended in 1992 after Arthur announced her decision to depart the series. White, McClanahan, and Getty reprised their roles Rose, Blanche, and Sophia in the spin-off ''[[The Golden Palace]]''.&lt;ref name=thr/&gt; The series was short-lived, lasting only one season. In addition, White reprised her Rose Nylund character in guest appearances on the NBC shows ''[[Empty Nest]]'' and ''[[Nurses (TV series)|Nurses]]'', both set in Miami.&lt;ref name=thr/&gt;

After ''The Golden Palace'' ended,&lt;ref name=thr/&gt; White guest-starred on a number of television programs including ''[[Suddenly Susan]]'', ''[[The Practice]]'', and ''[[Yes, Dear]]'' where she received Emmy nominations for her individual appearances. She won an Emmy in 1996 for ''Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series'', appearing as herself on an episode of ''[[The John Larroquette Show]]''. In that episode, titled "Here We Go Again", a [[parody|spoof]] on ''[[Sunset Boulevard (film)|Sunset Boulevard]]'', a diva-like White convinces Larroquette to help write her [[memoir]]s. At one point ''Golden Girls'' co-stars McClanahan and Getty appear as themselves. Larroquette is forced to dress in drag as Beatrice Arthur, when all four appear in public as the "original" cast members. White comically envisions her Rose as the central character with the others as mere supporting players.

===2000s===
In December 2006, White joined the soap opera ''[[The Bold and the Beautiful]]'' in the role of Ann Douglas (where she would make 22 appearances), the long-lost mother of the show's matriarch, [[Stephanie Forrester (The Bold and the Beautiful)|Stephanie Forrester]], played by [[Susan Flannery]].&lt;ref name="2007sow"&gt;{{cite news | title=Returning | date=February 13, 2007 | publisher= Soap Opera Weekly| page = 5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  She also began a recurring role in ABC's ''[[Boston Legal]]'' from 2005 to 2008 as the calculating, blackmailing gossip-monger Catherine Piper, a role she originally played as a guest star on ''[[The Practice]]'' in 2004.&lt;ref name=thr/&gt;

White appeared several times on ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'' and ''[[The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson]]'' appearing in many sketches and returned to ''Password'' in its latest incarnation, ''Million Dollar Password'', on June 12, 2008, (episode #3), participating in the Million Dollar challenge at the end of the show. On May 19, 2008, she appeared on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'', taking part in the host's ''Mary Tyler Moore Show'' reunion special alongside every surviving cast member of the series.
Beginning in 2007, White was featured in television commercials for [[PetMeds]], highlighting her interest in animal rights and welfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite pr|title=1-800-PetMeds and Betty White Team Up to Promote Pet Health|url=http://www.1800petmeds.com/pressroom.jsp?id=50&amp;adate=01|accessdate=January 18, 2014|work=1-800-PetMeds|date=January 3, 2007|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201171815/http://www.1800petmeds.com/pressroom.jsp?id=50&amp;adate=01|archivedate=February 1, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A grassroots campaign on Facebook called "Betty White to Host SNL (Please)" began in January 2010. The group was approaching 500,000 members when NBC confirmed on March 11, 2010 that White would in fact host ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' on May 8. The appearance made her, at age 88, the oldest person to host the show, beating [[Miskel Spillman]], the winner of ''SNL'''s "Anybody Can Host" contest, who was 80 when she hosted in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Silverman|first=Stephen M.|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20350436,00.html|title=Betty White to Host Saturday Night Live May 8|work=People|date=March 11, 2010|accessdate=March 13, 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100314035250/http://www.people.com/people/article/0%2C%2C20350436%2C00.html|archivedate=March 14, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rice|first=Lynette|title='Saturday Night Live' with Betty White attracts big ratings|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2010/05/09/saturday-night-live-with-betty-white-attracts-big-ratings/|accessdate=January 18, 2014|newspaper=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=May 9, 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140127023641/http://insidetv.ew.com/2010/05/09/saturday-night-live-with-betty-white-attracts-big-ratings/|archivedate=January 27, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her opening monologue, White thanked Facebook and joked that she "didn't know what Facebook was, and now that I do know what it is, I have to say, it sounds like a huge waste of time."&lt;ref name="SNL2010" /&gt; The appearance earned her a 2010 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series, her seventh Emmy win overall.

''Hot in Cleveland'' was TV Land's first attempt at a first-run scripted comedy (the channel has [[rerun]] other sitcoms since its debut).

==Personal life==
===Family===
[[File:Allen Ludden Betty White 1963.JPG|thumb|right|White and [[Allen Ludden]] (1963)]]
In 1945, White married Dick Barker, a [[U.S. Army Air Corps]] [[pilot (aircraft)|pilot]].&lt;ref name=People19&gt;{{cite news|last=Gliatto|first=Tom|title=Forever Betty|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20129972,00.html|accessdate=January 18, 2014|newspaper=People|date=June 12, 1999|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201174853/http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20129972,00.html|archivedate=February 1, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The marriage was short-lived. In 1947, she married Lane Allen, a Hollywood [[Talent agent|agent]].&lt;ref name="People19" /&gt; This marriage ended in divorce in 1949.

On June 14, 1963, White married television host and personality [[Allen Ludden]], whom she had met on his game show ''Password'' as a celebrity guest in 1961,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=White|first=Betty|title=Here We Go Again: My Life In Television 1949â€“1995|location=New York|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=1995|isbn=0-684-80042-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and her legal name was changed to Betty White Ludden.&lt;ref name=BiographyCom/&gt; He proposed to White at least twice before she accepted. The couple appeared together in an episode of ''[[The Odd Couple (1970 TV series)|The Odd Couple]]'' featuring Felix's and Oscar's appearance on ''Password''. Ludden appeared as a guest panelist on ''Match Game'', with White sitting in the audience. (She was prompted to criticize one of Ludden's wrong answers on camera during an episode of ''Match Game '74''.) The two appeared together on the ''Match Game'' panel in 1974, 1975 and 1980.

Allen Ludden died from [[stomach cancer]] on June 9, 1981, in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name="Inside"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Allen Ludden, TV Host, Is Dead; On 'College Bowl' and 'Password'|newspaper=The New York Times|date=June 10, 1981|page=B6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Crawford|first=Setrige|title=Betty White Remembers Late Husband Allen Ludden on 90th Birthday|url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/betty-white-remebers-late-husband-allen-ludden-on-90th-birthday-67353/|accessdate=January 18, 2014|newspaper=[[The Christian Post]]|date=January 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; While they had no children together she is stepmother to his three children from his first marriage (Margaret McGloin Ludden died of cancer in 1961.)

=== Friendships ===
==== Bea Arthur  ====
White had a strained relationship with her ''Golden Girls'' co-star [[Bea Arthur]] on and off the set of their television show, commenting that Arthur "was not fond of her" and that "she found me a pain in the neck sometimes. It was my positive attitude and that made Bea mad sometimes.

==== Liberace ====
In a 2011 interview, White said that she always knew her close friend [[Liberace]] was gay and that she sometimes accompanied him to premieres.&lt;ref name="Bea Arthur was not fond"&gt;{{cite web|title=CNN Official Interview: Betty White: Bea Arthur was not fond of me|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-wTJ2hQCK8|work=CNN|accessdate=January 18, 2014|date=May 4, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140125210906/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-wTJ2hQCK8|archivedate=January 25, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A supporter of gay rights, White said that "If a couple has been together all that time â€“ and there are gay relationships that are more solid than some heterosexual ones â€“ I think it's fine if they want to get married.

Mind your own business, take care of your affairs, and don't worry about other people so much".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Moritz|first=Robert|title=Life Is a Scream for Betty|url=http://www.parade.com/132208/robertmoritz/betty-white-goes-wild/|accessdate=January 18, 2014|newspaper=[[Parade (magazine)|Parade]]|date=October 31, 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140121145821/http://www.parade.com/132208/robertmoritz/betty-white-goes-wild/|archivedate=January 21, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Mary Tyler Moore ====
[[Mary Tyler Moore]], and her then-husband [[Grant Tinker]] were close friends with White and Ludden. When [[Valerie Harper]] left ''The Mary Tyler Moore Show'' producers felt the show needed another female character and created Sue Ann Nivens in the process. Nivens was described as an "icky sweet Betty White type", but they went against asking White to audition. In a 2010 [[Archive of American Television]] interview, Moore explained that producers, aware of Moore and White's friendship, were initially hesitant to audition White for the role, the fear being that if she hadn't been right, that it would create awkwardness between the two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mary Tyler Moore &amp; Betty White on how Betty White was cast on the MTM Show - EMMYTVLEGENDS.ORG|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3NpO9c9gbk|accessdate=February 10, 2016|publisher=youtube|date=May 18, 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170416071950/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3NpO9c9gbk|archivedate=April 16, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

White is a pet enthusiast and an animal health [[advocate]] who works with animal organizations, including the [[Los Angeles Zoo]] Commission, the [[Morris Animal Foundation]], African Wildlife Foundation, and Actors &amp; Others for Animals. Her interest in [[animal rights]] and welfare began in the early 1970s while she was both producing and hosting the syndicated series, ''[[The Pet Set]]'', which spotlighted celebrities and their pets.&lt;ref name=thr/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=https://tv.yahoo.com/news/30-fun-facts-birthday-girl-betty-white-152000903.html|title=30 Fun Facts About Birthday Girl Betty White!|publisher=Tv.yahoo.com|date=January 17, 2014|accessdate=January 22, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150122191100/https://tv.yahoo.com/news/30-fun-facts-birthday-girl-betty-white-152000903.html|archivedate=January 22, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
