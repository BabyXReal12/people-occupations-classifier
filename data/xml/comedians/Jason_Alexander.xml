Alexander is best known for his role as [[George Costanza]] in the television series ''[[Seinfeld]]''. Other well-known roles include Phillip Stuckey in the film ''[[Pretty Woman (movie)|Pretty Woman]]'' (1990) and the title character in the animated series ''[[Duckman]]'' (1994–1997).

Alexander has had an active career on stage, appearing in several [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[musical theatre|musicals]] including ''[[Jerome Robbins' Broadway]]'' in 1989, for which he won the [[Tony Award]] as Best Leading Actor in a Musical. He appeared in the Los Angeles production of ''[[The Producers (musical)|The Producers]]''. He was the Artistic Director of "Reprise! Broadway's Best in Los Angeles", where he has directed several musicals.

==Early life==
Alexander was born in [[Newark, New Jersey]], the son of [[American Jews|Jewish]] parents Ruth Minnie ([[married and maiden names|née]] Simon), a nurse and [[health care]] administrator, and Alexander B. Greenspan, an accounting manager whose first name Jay later borrowed to create his stage name.&lt;ref name="kevinpollakschatshow"/&gt; He has a half-sister, Karen Van Horne, and a half-brother, Michael Greenspan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/39/Jason-Alexander.html | title=Jason Alexander Biography (1959-)| publisher=FilmReference.com | accessdate=2008-06-07 | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20150703213650/http://www.filmreference.com/film/39/Jason-Alexander.html | archivedate=July 3, 2015 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander grew up in [[Livingston, New Jersey]], and is a 1977 graduate of [[Livingston High School (New Jersey)|Livingston High School]].&lt;ref&gt;Weinraub, Bernard.

"I was born in 1959 and grew up in [[Livingston, New Jersey]], but I felt I knew these people very well"&lt;/ref&gt;  He attended [[Boston University]] but left the summer before his senior year, after getting work in the city of [[New York City|New York]]. At [[Boston University]], Alexander wanted to pursue classical acting, but a professor redirected him toward comedy after noticing his physique, remarking, "I know your heart and soul are Hamlet, but you will never play Hamlet."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Laskowski|first1=Amy|title=Seinfeld's Costanza Gives Master Class in Acting at CFA|journal=Bostonia|date=February 2015|page=4|publisher=Boston University}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded an honorary degree in 1995.

==Acting career==

===Stage career===
Alexander began his acting career on the New York stage and is an accomplished singer and dancer. On [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] he appeared in [[Stephen Sondheim]]'s ''[[Merrily We Roll Along (musical)|Merrily We Roll Along]],'' [[John Kander|Kander]] &amp; [[Fred Ebb|Ebb]]'s ''[[The Rink (musical)|The Rink]]'', [[Neil Simon]]'s ''[[Broadway Bound]]'', ''Accomplice'', and ''[[Jerome Robbins' Broadway]]'', for which he garnered the 1989 [[Tony Award]] for Best Leading Actor in a Musical. Returning to the stage in 2003, Alexander was cast in a successful run, opposite [[Martin Short]], in the Los Angeles production of [[Mel Brooks]]' ''[[The Producers (musical)|The Producers]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Kenneth Jones |url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/70909.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120524203735/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/70909.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=May 24, 2012 |work=Playbill |date=July 17, 2002 |title=Mel Brooks Gets Jason Alexander and Martin Short for L.A. Producers, Starting May 2, 2003 |accessdate=2008-06-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander also appeared with [[Kelsey Grammer]] in the 2004 [[A Christmas Carol (2004 film)|musical adaptation]] of [[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'', playing [[Jacob Marley]] to Grammer's [[Ebenezer Scrooge]]. He continues to appear in live stage shows, including [[Barbra Streisand]]'s memorable birthday party for Stephen Sondheim at the Hollywood Bowl, in which he appeared with [[Angela Lansbury]], performing selections from ''[[Sweeney Todd]]''. Alexander was recently named the Artistic Director of Reprise Theatre Company in Los Angeles, where he previously directed ''[[Sunday in the Park with George]]''. He is scheduled to direct the upcoming revival of ''[[Damn Yankees]]'' at Reprise. In 2015, he replaced [[Larry David]] as the lead in David's Broadway play ''[[Fish in the Dark]].'' Alexander co-starred opposite [[Sherie Rene Scott]] in the September 2017 world premiere of [[John Patrick Shanley]]'s ''The Portuguese Kid'' at the [[Manhattan Theatre Club]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://manhattantheatreclub.com/2017-18-season/|title=Manhattan Theatre Club – 2017-18 Season|website=Manhattan Theatre Club|language=en|access-date=2017-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television===
Alexander is best known as one of the key cast members of the award-winning television [[situation comedy|sitcom]] ''[[Seinfeld]]'' (1989–1998), in which he played the bumbling [[George Costanza]] (Seinfeld's character's best friend since childhood). Alexander was nominated for six (6) [[Primetime Emmy Awards]] and four (4) [[Golden Globe Awards]] for his performance as Costanza, but did not win any, mainly due to his co-star, [[Michael Richards]] being nominated and winning for his role as [[Cosmo Kramer]]. He did, however, win a [[Screen Actors Guild Award|Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Comedy Series]] for his work.

Before ''Seinfeld'', he starred in a commercial for John Deere and in a short-lived [[CBS]] sitcom called ''[[Everything's Relative (1987 TV series)|Everything's Relative]]'' in 1987 which lasted ten episodes. Concurrently with his ''Seinfeld'' role, Alexander provided the voice of the lead character in the [[cult following|cult]] animated series ''[[Duckman]]'' (1994–1997). Alexander voiced [[Catbert]], the evil director of human resources, in the short-lived ''[[Dilbert (TV series)|Dilbert]]'' animated series based on the popular comic strip.

Alexander made cameo appearances in the second season of ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'', playing himself and appeared in the seventh season of ''Curb Your Enthusiasm'', along with the other three principal ''[[Seinfeld]]'' cast members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hollywoodinsider.ew.com/2009/03/seinfeld-cast-t.html |author=Rice, Lynette |title=Exclusive: 'Seinfeld' cast to appear on 'Curb Your Enthusiasm' |publisher=[[EW.com]] |date=2009-03-05 |accessdate=2009-07-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703123616/http://hollywoodinsider.ew.com/2009/03/seinfeld-cast-t.html |archivedate=2009-07-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He had a part in the ABC sitcom ''[[Dinosaurs (TV series)|Dinosaurs]]'', as Al "Sexual" Harris (who frequently engaged in [[sexual harassment]]) as well as other voices. Despite a successful career in film and stage, Alexander never managed to repeat his ''Seinfeld''-level of success in television. 2001 marked his first post-''Seinfeld'' return to prime-time television: the heavily promoted but short-lived [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] sitcom ''[[Bob Patterson (TV series)|Bob Patterson]]'' (which was canceled after five episodes). Alexander partially blames the lack of success on the mood of the country after [[September 11 attacks|9/11]].&lt;ref name=parade&gt;{{cite news | title = In Step With: Jason Alexander | publisher = Parade Magazine | date = April 3, 2005 | url = http://www.parade.com/articles/editions/2005/edition_04-03-2005/in_step_with_0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His second chance as a TV series lead, the [[CBS]] sitcom ''[[Listen Up! (TV series)|Listen Up!]]'' (September 20, 2004 to April 25, 2005), also fell short of a second season. Alexander was the principal [[executive producer]] of the series, based very loosely on the life of the popular sports-media personality [[Tony Kornheiser]]. Alexander appeared on the ''[[Family Guy: Live in Vegas]]'' CD and sang a verse in a song. He was featured in the ''[[Friends]]'' episode "[[The One Where Rosita Dies]]" as a suicidal supply manager named Earl. [[Phoebe Buffay|Phoebe]] calls him trying to sell him [[toner]] and she learns about his problem and tries to persuade him not to commit suicide. This is referred to in an episode of ''[[Malcolm in the Middle]]'' where Alexander appears as a neurotic and critical loner called Leonard. He describes himself as free and mentions that he makes money with a job "selling toner over the phone". Later in the episode, he is repeatedly harassed by a man named George – his character's name on ''Seinfeld''. Alexander appeared in the 1995 TV version of the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musical ''[[Bye Bye Birdie (musical)|Bye Bye Birdie]]'', as Conrad Birdie's agent, Albert Peterson. He guest-starred in episode 8 of the 1996 variety show ''[[Muppets Tonight]]''.

Alexander appeared on ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'' on the episode "[[Think Tank (Star Trek: Voyager)|Think Tank]]" playing a genius alien named Kurros who was trying to get [[Seven of Nine]] to serve on his ship. He appeared in "[[One Night at Mercy]]", the first episode of the short-lived [[The Twilight Zone (2002 TV series)|2002 revival of ''The Twilight Zone'']], playing [[Death (personification)|Death]]. He featured in the 2005 ''[[Monk (TV series)|Monk]]'' episode "[[Mr. Monk and the Other Detective]]" as Monk's rival, [[Marty Eels]]. On the June 26, 2006 episode of the ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'' talk show, Alexander demonstrated several self-defense techniques. He was the Host of the 230th July 4, 2006 of the [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] July 4 "A Capitol Fourth" Celebrations in Washington, D.C. in which he sang, danced, and played tuned drums. In 2006, Alexander signed on to feature as a regular cast member in the second season of ''[[Everybody Hates Chris]]''. Alexander was the host of [[Comedy Central Roast of William Shatner|the Comedy Central Roast of actor William Shatner]] on August 13, 2006 (first airdate: August 20, 2006). In 2007, Alexander was a guest star in the third episode of the [[improv comedy]] series ''[[Thank God You're Here (US TV series)|Thank God You're Here]]''. He is a frequent guest and panelist on: [[Bill Maher]]'s ''[[Politically Incorrect]]'' and ''[[Real Time with Bill Maher|Real Time]]'' shows; ''[[Hollywood Squares]]''; the ''[[The Late Late Show (CBS TV series)|Late Late Show]]'', with both [[Craig Kilborn]] and [[Craig Ferguson]]; and the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]''.

In 2008, Alexander guest-starred on the [[CBS]] show ''[[Criminal Minds]]'' in the [[List of Criminal Minds episodes (season 4)|season four]] episode "Masterpiece" as Prof. Rothschild,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1256105/ |title="Criminal Minds" Masterpiece|date=2008|publisher=IMDb.com|accessdate=2015-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/criminal-minds-2008/episode-8-season-4/masterpiece/192244 |title=Criminal Minds Episode Guide 2008 Season 4 – Masterpiece, Episode 8 |publisher=Tvguide.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; a well-educated [[serial killer]] obsessed with the [[Fibonacci number|Fibonacci sequence]] who sends the team into a race against time to save his last victims. He returned in the same season to direct the episode "Conflicted", featuring the actor [[Jackson Rathbone]]. In 2011, Alexander was the guest star in an episode of ''[[Harry's Law]]'', playing a high school teacher bringing a wrongful dismissal suit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2044305/|title=Harry's Law|publisher=IMDb.com|accessdate=2015-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Movies===
In addition to his roles as an insensitive lawyer in ''[[Pretty Woman]]'', co-starring with [[Richard Gere]], and as inept womanizer Mauricio in ''[[Shallow Hal]]'', with [[Jack Black]], Alexander has appeared in ''[[Love! Valour! Compassion!]]'', ''[[Dunston Checks In]]'', ''[[Love and Action in Chicago (film)|Love and Action in Chicago]]'', ''[[The Last Supper (1995 film)|The Last Supper]]'' and the psychological horror film ''[[Jacob's Ladder (1990 film)|Jacob's Ladder]]''. He voiced the [[gargoyle]] Hugo in [[Disney]]'s 1996 [[animated film]] ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'' and its direct-to-video sequel, ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame II]]''. His other Disney voice work includes ''[[House of Mouse]]'' and the video game ''[[Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://i.imgur.com/SPgIW.jpg |title=Jason Alexander to debut in ''Kingdom Hearts''|publisher=I.imgur.com|accessdate=2013-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has dabbled in directing, starting with 1996's ''[[For Better or Worse (film)|For Better or Worse]]'' and 1999's ''[[Just Looking]]''. He also played the toymaker [[A.C. Gilbert]] in the 2002 movie ''[[The Man Who Saved Christmas (film)|The Man Who Saved Christmas]]''. In 2009, Alexander had a small role in the movie ''[[Hachi: A Dog's Tale]]'' as a train station manager, alongside his ''Pretty Woman'' costar [[Richard Gere]].

==Other work==
Alexander is featured in country music star [[Brad Paisley]]'s music videos "[[Celebrity (Brad Paisley song)|Celebrity]]" and "[[Online (song)|Online]]", the latter of which he directed and won the 2007 [[Country Music Association]]'s Video of the Year Award for. In August 2012, he co-starred in the music video "[[Trying Not to Love You]]" by [[Nickelback]] with former ''[[Baywatch]]'' star [[Brooke Burns]]. In January 1995, Alexander did a commercial for [[Rold Gold]] pretzels to be broadcast during the [[Super Bowl]]. The commercial depicts him with ''[[Frasier]]'' dog "Eddie" jumping out of an airplane with a parachute over the stadium. After the commercial, the audience is brought back to a supposedly "live feed" of the playing field hearing startled sports commentators as Alexander and the dog land in the field to wild applause. In the summer of 2005, he appeared with [[Lee Iacocca]] in ads for [[DaimlerChrysler]]. Iacocca did the ads as part of a way to raise money for Dr. Denise Faustman's research to cure [[autoimmunity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faustmanlab.org |title=faustmanlab.org |publisher=faustmanlab.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Lee Iacocca and Jason Alexander have had loved ones whose lives have been adversely affected by autoimmunity. One of Alexander's earliest television roles was in a [[McDonald's]] commercial advertising the [[McDLT#History|McDLT]], in which he sings. He has appeared in [[Kentucky Fried Chicken]] (KFC) commercials, including one with baseball superstar [[Barry Bonds]] of the [[San Francisco Giants]] and another one opposite [[Trista Rehn]] of ''[[The Bachelorette]]''. It was rumored that he no longer appears in these commercials due to the alleged [[cruelty to animals]] by KFC suppliers and [[slaughterhouse]]s, but he refuted that in the August 2, 2006 issue of ''[[Adweek]]''. Alexander said, "That's [[PETA]] bullcrap. I loved working for KFC. I was targeted by PETA to broker something between them. I think KFC really stepped up to the plate; unfortunately PETA did not."

He performed a [[mentalism]] and magic act at [[The Magic Castle]] in [[Hollywood, California]] from April 24 to 30, 2006, and was later named The Academy of Magical Arts Parlor Magician of the Year for this act. Alexander had previously been given the Academy's Junior Achievement Award in 1989.&lt;ref name="Hall of Fame"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.magiccastle.com/hall_of_fame/|title=Hall of Fame|website=The Academy of Magical Arts}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander was the national spokesman for the [[Scleroderma]] Foundation, a leading organization dedicated to raising awareness of the disease and assisting those who are afflicted. Alexander voiced the character Abis Mal in ''[[The Return of Jafar]]'' and the television series based on Disney's 1992 animated film, ''[[Aladdin (TV series)|Aladdin]]''. Jason Alexander guest starred in ''[[Malcolm in the Middle]]'' as an intelligent but unpleasant individual (Lenard) who Malcolm meets in the park. He makes money as a telephone salesman and spends his time playing chess in the park. Malcolm, afraid of ending up like Lenard, tries to get him to change his ways and get a full-time job. In 2007, Alexander appeared in a commercial for the [[ASPCA]], which has aired on cable TV stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDCP75iz22M | title = Logan, a victim of animal cruelty|publisher=Youtube.com | accessdate = 2010-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, Alexander appeared in a commercial for Miller Lite, with Yogi Berra as the celebrity, speaking about Miller Lite using his unique malapropism eloquence, sitting at a bar with many others including a young Jason Alexander standing behind Berra's left shoulder.

In 2009, Alexander lent his voice talents in the [[Thomas Nelson (publisher)|Thomas Nelson]] audio Bible production known as The Word of Promise. In this dramatized audio, Alexander played the character of [[Joseph (son of Jacob)|Joseph]]. The project featured a large ensemble of well known Hollywood actors including [[Jim Caviezel]], [[Lou Gossett Jr.]], [[John Rhys-Davies]], [[Jon Voight]], [[Gary Sinise]], [[Christopher McDonald]], [[Marisa Tomei]] and [[John Schneider (screen actor)|John Schneider]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://wordofpromise.thomasnelson.com/cast.php]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029002922/http://wordofpromise.thomasnelson.com/cast.php |date=October 29, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://articles.latimes.com/2009/nov/16/local/me-beliefs16 |title=BELIEFS : Stars lined up for elaborate audio Bible : Michael York, Jason Alexander and many others gave voice to a 79-CD reading of Old and New Testaments | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Martha |last=Groves |date=November 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His first time performing a similar show of this nature was in 2006 for ''Jason Alexander's Comedy Christmas''. In February/March 2010, Alexander starred in his own show, ''The Donny Clay Experience'', at the [[Planet Hollywood Resort]] in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]]. The Donny Clay character, which he has performed in a tour of the United States, is a [[self-help]] guru in a similar mold to his ''[[Bob Patterson (TV series)|Bob Patterson]]'' character.
