'''Jethro''' is the [[stage name]] of [[British people|British]]&lt;ref name=About&gt;{{cite web|title=About Jethro|url=http://www.jethro.co.uk/cee5#!about/cee5|website=jethro.co.uk|accessdate=13 September 2014|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stand-up comedy|stand-up comedian]] '''Geoffrey J Rowe''', based in [[Lewdown]] in Devon. Rowe was born in March 1948 in [[St Buryan]], a [[village]] in west [[Cornwall]].

After leaving school, Rowe was apprenticed as a carpenter and then worked as a timber man in a tin mine. At the age of eighteen he joined the [[St Just in Penwith|St. Just]] and District Operatic Society and, in addition to his [[bass (voice type)|bass voice]], locals found he had a talent for making an audience laugh. He began visiting the pubs of Cornwall to sing and joke and was quickly hailed{{by whom|date=April 2018}} as Cornwall’s top [[comedian|comic]].

==Television==
{{Unreferenced|section|date=August 2018}}
Rowe made his TV debut on the [[Westward Television]] programme ‘Treasure Hunt’ playing a pirate co-host. 

In addition to his appearances on stage and video, Jethro has made nine appearances on TV shows hosted by [[Des O'Connor]]. His first appearance was on the ''Des O’Connor Tonight'' show in 1990, followed by a return for the Christmas Eve show later that year - the first time a comedian was invited back during one series. He also appeared five times on [[Jim Davidson]]’s ''[[The Generation Game|Generation Game]]'' show, twice giving a demonstration of how to make a [[Pasty|Cornish pasty]]. Jethro was also involved in one of the show’s longest sequences of [[blooper|out-takes]], removed due to his and Davidson's uncontrolled fits of laughter but later shown separately; it involved the story of [[Hans Brinker, or The Silver Skates|Hans Brinker]], “the boy who put his finger in the dike”, with a pun on [[dyke (slang)|dyke]]. Davidson has said that he regards Jethro as his favourite storyteller, one of his great stories being ''Train don’t stop [[Camborne]] Wednesdays''.

He has hosted two shows of his own, ''The Jethro Junction'', on [[ITV Wales &amp; West|HTV]] and in December 2001 appeared in front of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] for the [[Royal Variety Show]].

==Charity work==
{{Unreferenced|section|date=August 2018}}
The comedian lives in Lewdown in west Devon and in March 1995 walked the distance from [[Land's End]] to Lewdown to raise money for the Bristol Cancer Open Scanner Appeal. He gave a show each night at a local venue where he raised in total £20,000.

==Political views==
In March 2014,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.westbriton.co.uk/Cornish-comedian-Jethro-joins-UKIP/story-20744417-detail/story.html&lt;/ref&gt; Rowe announced he would be supporting [[UK Independence Party|UKIP]] at the next UK general election. He once stood as an anti-EU independent candidate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westbriton.co.uk/Cornish-comedian-Jethro-joins-UKIP/story-20744417-detail/story.html|title=Cornish comedian Jethro joins UKIP - West Briton|work=West Briton|accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shooting==
{{Unreferenced|section|date=August 2018}}
Rowe is a skilled marksman. He often competes in [[Down-The-Line]], a form of clay pigeon shooting competition at B class standard. He has been mentioned numerous times in the [[Clay Pigeon Shooting Association]]’s ''Pull!'' magazine as one of Cornwall’s most prominent shooters.

==Horse breeding==
{{Unreferenced|section|date=August 2018}}
Whilst not performing comedy Rowe shows his horses all over the country. They have won most major prizes, including at [[Wembley Arena]]. He has bred show horses and racehorses and is a well known judge.  He also used to run his own venue, ''Jethro’s Club'', where he performed each year for charity. He was one of the directors of channel [[Sound TV]] and  performed at [[Somerset County Cricket Club]] at the benefit dinner of England batsman [[Marcus Trescothick]].

==Rugby==
In earlier times Rowe played over 100 games for the Penzance Pirates [[Rugby football|rugby]] team, now better known as the [[Cornish Pirates]]. His rugby interest was nurtured at [[Cape Cornwall School]] under the guidance of Derek Small. He played in [[St Just in Penwith|St Just]]’s first ever match back in 1967 and then in 1970 had his first spell with the Pirates. Rowe played his 100th match for the Pirates in 1974-75.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cornish-pirates.com/pzn/history/players/jethro.html|title=Club History - Players - Geoffrey Rowe - ‘Jethro’|work=Penzance - Newlyn RFC Club History|accessdate=2008-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Rowe also played for [[Newlyn Senior]] first team for 10 years from 1967 to 1977 as [[prop forward]].{{cn|date=August 2018}} One of his teammates at the time was [[Brian 'Stack' Stevens]] who went on to become one of English rugby’s most famous players. He also played for [[Wadebridge Camels]], captaining the highly successful and competitive ‘Commandos’ second XV.{{cn|date=August 2018}}
