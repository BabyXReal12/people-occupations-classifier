'''Eli Raphael Roth''' (born April 18, 1972) is an American film director, producer, writer, and actor. As a director and producer, he is most closely associated with the [[Horror film|horror]] genre, first coming to prominence for directing the 2005 films ''[[Hostel (2005 film)|Hostel]]'' and ''[[Hostel: Part II]]''.  

As an actor, Roth's most prominent role has been as Donny "The Bear Jew" Donowitz in [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s war film ''[[Inglourious Basterds]]'' for which he won both a SAG Award (Best Ensemble) and a BFCA Critic's Choice Award (Best Acting Ensemble). Journalists have included him in a group of filmmakers dubbed the [[Splat Pack]] for their explicitly violent and bloody horror films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=My mission to appall, by the Splat Pack king |first=Jeremy |last=Kay |newspaper=Telegraph |date=June 8, 2007 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/starsandstories/3665672/My-mission-to-appal-by-the-Splat-Pack-king.html |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Roth received the Visionary Award for his contributions to horror, at the [[Stanley Film Festival]]. He directed the 2015 [[erotic thriller]] film ''[[Knock Knock (2015 film)|Knock Knock]]'' and the 2018 [[action film]] ''[[Death Wish (2018 film)|Death Wish]]'', a remake of the [[Death Wish (1974 film)|1974 original]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/act-four/wp/2018/03/07/eli-roths-death-wish-cements-his-status-as-the-premier-maker-of-dad-horror/?noredirect=on|title=Eli Roth’s 'Death Wish' Cements His Status as the Premier Maker of 'Dad Horror'|work=Washington Post|last=Bunch|first=Sonny|date=March 7, 2018|accessdate=May 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Roth was born in [[Newton, Massachusetts|Newton]], Massachusetts, to Sheldon Roth, a [[psychiatrist]]/[[psychoanalyst]] and clinical professor at [[Harvard Medical School]], and Cora Roth, a painter.&lt;ref name="roth2"&gt;{{cite news|last=McCarthy|first=Phillip|author2=|title=Captive audiences|pages=|publisher=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=June 15, 2007|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2007/06/14/1181414390274.html|accessdate=2007-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roth was raised [[Jew]]ish (his family is from [[Austria]], Hungary, Russia, and [[Poland]]).&lt;ref name="Roth1"&gt;{{cite news | last =Fischer| first =Paul| author2=| title =Eli Roth Has The Fever| pages=| publisher =Film Monthly| date =September 2, 2003 | url =http://www.filmmonthly.com/Profiles/Articles/ERoth/ERoth.html| accessdate =2007-01-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ref091"&gt;{{cite news|last=Parks|first=Louis B.|author2=|title=Eli Roth gets a head-turning role in Inglourious Basterds|pages=|publisher=Houston Chronicle|date=August 19, 2009|url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/ent/movies/6578409.html|accessdate=2009-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-11261473/TARANTINO-MOVIE-DRAWS-CRITICISM-LOSE.html Goliath.ecnext.com]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to English, he speaks French, Italian, and Russian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fandango.com/movieblog/cine-latino-aftershock-star-eli-roth-goes-mad-for-chile-talks-green-inferno-and-gives-horror-newbies-advice-738263.html Cine Latino: 'Aftershock' Star Eli Roth Goes Mad for Chile, Talks 'Green Inferno' and Gives Horror Newbies Advice]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|5FPxUy7abFM|Элай Рот говорит по-русски}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roth began shooting films at the age of eight, after watching [[Ridley Scott]]'s ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' (1979).&lt;ref name="indep"&gt;{{cite news

To fund his films while in college Roth worked as an online [[cybersex]] operator for ''[[Penthouse Magazine]]'', posing as a woman, as well as a production assistant on feature films.&lt;ref name="cybersex"&gt;{{cite news |title=Eli Roth talks about his Blueberries, body and cybersex proficiency|url=http://ohnotheydidnt.livejournal.com/41862531.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roth also ran the office of producer [[Frederick Zollo]],&lt;ref name="forbe"/&gt; leaving after graduation to devote himself to writing full-time. He collected unemployment and found work on [[Howard Stern]]'s ''[[Private Parts (1997 film)|Private Parts]]'' as Stern's assistant, staying at Silvercup Studios in Queens at night working on his scripts while Stern slept.

Actress [[Camryn Manheim]] gave Roth one of his first Hollywood jobs, as an extra on ''[[The Practice]],'' when he moved to Los Angeles. Roth would stay in Manheim's dressing room, working on his scripts, while she filmed the show. The two had become friends in New York, while Roth was working fo Zollo.  Roth also met Manheim's cousin Howie Nuchow (former EVP of [[Mandalay Sports Entertainment]] and also from the Boston area) at her family Passover seder—this led to Roth's first animation project, "Chowdaheads", the following year. Roth also co-wrote a project called "The Extra" with Manheim,&lt;ref name="boston family"&gt;{{cite news |first=Geoff |last=Edgers |publisher=Boston globe |title=The family cut-up |date=November 9, 2003 |accessdate=September 28, 2009|url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/living/articles/2003/09/11/the_family_cut_up/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; who later sold the pitch to producer (and former CEO and Chairman of Fox Studios) Bill Mechanic's Pandemonium company.

==Film career==
At NYU film school, Roth wrote and directed a student film called ''Restaurant Dogs,'' an homage to [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s ''[[Reservoir Dogs]]''. The film was nominated for a Student Academy Award in 1995, ultimately winning its division (Division III).

Through his internship with [[Frederick Zollo]], Roth met [[David Lynch]] and remained in touch over the years, eventually producing content for Lynch with his fledgling website in the late 1990s.&lt;ref name="boston family"/&gt; Through Lynch, Roth met film and TV composer [[Angelo Badalamenti]], whose music he used in his first feature film. He also met a member of special effects company KNB EFX, which contributed to his first feature.

In 1999, Roth moved to LA, where he wrote, directed, edited, produced, animated, and provided some voices for a series of animated shorts called ''[[Chowdaheads]]'' for Mandalay Sports Entertainment. They were to be shown between ''[[WCW Monday Nitro]]'' pro wrestling matches, but [[Eric Bischoff|the C.E.O. of WCW]] who had green-lit the project was fired the weekend before they were to air, so they were finished but never actually broadcast. Roth's friend Noah Belson co-wrote the shorts and provided the other character voices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/1999/tv/news/tnt-s-nitro-adds-cartoon-seg-1117755541/|title=TNT’s 'Nitro' Adds Cartoon Seg|work=Variety|last=Adalian|first=Josef|date=September 10, 1999|accessdate=May 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-2000, with financing from the website Z.com to deliver a 5-minute pilot, Roth wrote, directed, animated and produced a series of [[Stop motion|stop-motion]] shorts called ''The Rotten Fruit''.&lt;ref name="boston family"/&gt; The company folded after several episodes were done, and its domain name was picked up by [[Nissan]] for its "Z" sports car. A portion of Roth's work for ''The Rotten Fruit'' was done at the Snake Pit studios in Burbank with miniature sets, poseable clay, and foam figures, two high-end digital still cameras, and a pair of [[Macintosh]] computers. Noah Belson co-wrote and performed character voices.

===''Cabin Fever''===
Roth had co-wrote ''[[Cabin Fever (2002 film)|Cabin Fever]]'' in with his college roommate Randy Pearlstein. They based the premise on Roth's having contracted a skin infection while riding ponies at a family friend's farm in Iceland in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/02/new-trailer-for-eli-roths-cabin-fever-remake-offer.html|title=New Trailer for Eli Roth’s Cabin Fever Remake Offers A Bloody Disgusting Time|work=Paste|last=White|first=Abbey|date=February 1, 2016|accessdate=May 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of it was written in 1996, while Roth worked as a production assistant for [[Howard Stern]]'s movie ''[[Private Parts (1997 film)|Private Parts]]''.

''Cabin Fever'' was produced in 2001 on a budget of $1.5 million raised from private investors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=cabinfever.htm|title=Cabin Fever|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|accessdate=2016-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was sold to [[Lionsgate]] at the 2002 [[Toronto International Film Festival]] for $3.5 million, the biggest sale of that year's festival. Released in 2003, it was Lionsgate's highest-grossing film of the year, earning $22 million at the U.S. box office and $35 million worldwide.  Lionsgate's stock rose from $1.98 a share to nearly $6 a share after the film was released; the company used its new net worth to buy [[Artisan Entertainment]].&lt;ref&gt;Source: Lionsgate website financial reports&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Cabin Fever'' made Roth a star in the horror genre. In a 2004 ''Premiere Magazine'' interview, [[Quentin Tarantino]] called it "the best new American film".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thrillist.com/entertainment/nation/quentin-tarantino-spider-man-clown-connection|title=How Quentin Tarantino &amp; Killer Clowns Led to a Spider Man Reboot|work=Thrillist|last=Patches|first=Matt|date=June 10, 2016|accessdate=May 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Hostel''===
In 2005, Roth's second feature, ''[[Hostel (2005 film)|Hostel]]'', was made for just over $4 million. It opened No.&amp;nbsp;1 at the box office in January 2006, taking in $20 million its first weekend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Ryan |last=Stewart |title=Audiences Hostile to 'Hostel&amp;nbsp;II' At Box Office|pages=|publisher=Cinematical|date=June 10, 2007|url=http://www.cinematical.com/2007/06/10/audiences-hostile-to-hostel-ii-at-box-office//|accessdate=2009-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Roth returning to 'Hostel'? |pages= |publisher=Time Out |date=February 3, 2006 |url=http://www.timeout.com/film/news/897/ |accessdate=2009-09-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607122227/http://www.timeout.com/film/news/897/ |archivedate=June 7, 2011 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film went on to gross $80 million worldwide in box office, and more than $180 million on DVD. In April 2006, on Roth's birthday, the ''Hostel'' DVD opened at No.&amp;nbsp;1.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} Although the story is set in [[Slovakia]], all the exteriors were shot in the [[Czech Republic]].

In the movie, three friends are lured to visit a hostel where they think their sexual fantasies will come true. Instead, they fall into the clutches of an international syndicate that provides first-hand torture and killing experiences for rich, sadistic tourists. The film was rated No.&amp;nbsp;1 on [[Bravo (US TV channel)|Bravo TV]]'s ''30 Even Scarier Movie Moments'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video  | people = Kevin Kaufman  | title =  The 100 Scariest Movie Moments   | url =  https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0450892/  | medium = TV-Series  | publisher =  Bravo TV   |date =2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Empire Magazine]] readers voted ''Hostel'' the Best Horror Film of 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Empire Readers Awards 2007 |url=http://www.empireonline.com/awards/horror.asp |work= |publisher=Empire Magazine Online |accessdate=2009-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roth reportedly turned down studio directing jobs to make ''Hostel''. He took a directing salary of only $10,000 to keep the budget as low as possible, so there would be no limits set on its violence. In January 2006, film critic [[David Edelstein]] in ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine credited Roth with creating the horror subgenre "[[torture porn]]", or "gorno", using excessive violence to excite audiences like a sexual act.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Edelstein]]. "[http://nymag.com/movies/features/15622/ Now Playing at Your Local Multiplex: Torture Porn]", ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'', published on January 28, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Thanksgiving''===
In 2007, Roth directed and narrated the faux trailer segment ''Thanksgiving'' for ''[[Grindhouse (film)|Grindhouse]]'' as well as appearing in ''Death Proof'', Tarantino's segment of the film. Roth and co-writer Jeff Rendell won a 2007 [[Spike TV]] [[Scream Award]] for best "screamplay" for their work in ''Grindhouse,'' sharing the honor with Tarantino, [[Robert Rodriguez]], [[Rob Zombie]] and [[Edgar Wright]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/18206|title=Giving Thanks With Eli Roth's 'Thanksgiving' Trailer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Hostel: Part II''===
[[File:Deodato - Roth.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Eli Roth with [[Ruggero Deodato]] on the set of ''Hostel: Part&amp;nbsp;II.'' (2007)]]
''[[Hostel: Part II]]'' opened in sixth place in June 2007, with $8.2 million; it went on to gross $17.6 million in US theaters. The film, which cost $10.2 million, earned $35 million in theaters worldwide and $50 million on DVD and pay television.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=hostel2.htm Hostel Part II (2007)]. Box Office Mojo. Retrieved on 2011-09-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lionsgate attributed the lower grosses to the summer release, opposite blockbusters such as ''[[Shrek the Third|Shrek&amp;nbsp;3]]'', ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End]]'' and ''[[Ocean's Thirteen|Ocean's 13]]'', as well as the film's workprint having been leaked online before its release. Close to 2 million illegal workprint downloads were tracked the day ''Hostel&amp;nbsp;2'' opened.

{{quote|I don't know if it was the most downloaded film of all time, but there are tracking services that track what movies are being downloaded. And a copy of ''Hostel&amp;nbsp;2'' leaked out before its release and they had it, it was like millions and millions of hits. Not only was it downloaded, but in the countries it was downloaded – like Mexico and Brazil – there were copies on the street for practically a penny. You could buy ''Hostel&amp;nbsp;2'' for a quarter in Mexico City. As a result, in a lot of countries where the piracy was bad, they just didn't even release it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1572192/20071017/story.jhtml|title=Eli Roth 'Furious' Over 'Hostel' Pirates: 'I Don't Want Those Fans,' He Says}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''Hostel Part II'' was nominated for six Spike TV Scream Awards, including best horror film and best director. It was on ''Entertainment Weekly'''s list of the 20 best horror films of the past 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=14.

===''Endangered Species''===
In 2009, while acting in ''Inglourious Basterds'', Roth said he would soon begin his next film, ''Endangered Species''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/18296|title=Some Final Tweaks on Eli Roth's 'Endangered Species'|publisher=BloodyDisgusting}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|I can't say anything without giving anything away!… I saw ''Transformers'' and ''Cloverfield'' and thought, 'I have an idea for a mass destruction movie.' But it's going to be very different from those films.

In a 2013 interview with ''The Guardian'', Roth indicated that he had suspended work on ''Endangered Species'' to focus on 2015's ''The Green Inferno''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2013/feb/20/eli-roth-questions|title=Eli Roth Answers Your Questions|last=Boult|first=Adam|date=20 February 2013|work=The Guardian|accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''The Green Inferno'' ===
Roth directed the cannibal horror film ''[[The Green Inferno (film)|The Green Inferno]]'' (2013), which was inspired by his love of Mondo horror films such as the infamous ''[[Cannibal Holocaust]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://screenrant.com/eli-roth-directing-green-inferno-ryanz-172866/|title=Eli Roth Returning To Direct The Green Inferno|author=Robert Yaniz Jr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Death Wish''===
Roth’s 2018 remake of the film ''Death Wish'' opened to $13 million at the box office. The film is centered around a trauma surgeon who turns to vigilantism after his family is attacked. The film was panned by critics "pro-gun propaganda" and ill-timed in the wake of the [[Stoneman Douglas High School shooting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2018/03/eli-roth-defends-death-wish-remake-pro-gun-get-out-1201936200/|title=Eli Roth Defends 'Death Wish' Remake by Claiming It’s 'Not Pro-Gun' and Comparing it to 'Get Out'|work=IndieWire|last=Sharf|first=Zack|date=March 5, 2018|accessdate=May 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roth defended the movie stating that the movie was not pro-gun and that he wanted the film to focus on family, protecting one's family and seeking justice for your family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ew.com/movies/2018/03/05/eli-roth-responds-death-wish-remake-critics/|title=Death Wish Director Eli Roth Responds to Critics of Controversial Remake|work=Entertainment Weekly|last=Schwartz|first=Dana|date=March 5, 2018|accessdate=May 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other projects===

==== Film ====
In 2002, Roth brought a shot-for-shot remake by kids of ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' to the attention of both [[Harry Knowles]] and [[Steven Spielberg]]. He'd had a copy in his video collection for years, and showed it at Knowles' [[Butt-Numb-A-Thon]] film festival in December. The response was so great that Roth took the tape to his first meeting at [[DreamWorks Pictures|DreamWorks]] to give to Spielberg. An executive called the next week saying Spielberg loved it and wanted to contact the filmmakers. Roth had never met them, but Google-searched every name in the credits until he found Jayson Lamb, the cinematographer. The three filmmakers—Lamb, Chris Strompolis and Eric Zala (a former [[Activision]] employee) -- hadn't spoken to each other in years when Roth contacted them. Roth, feeling their film was so powerful he had to do whatever he could to make sure fans saw it, introduced it at its premiere at [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]] in May 2008, five and a half years after he first gave the tape to Knowles.  Soon, the three reunited friends were touring the world, doing charity screenings.[[File:Eli Roth 2007.jpg|thumb|left|170px|Roth at the Spike TV [[Scream Awards]], 2007]]
In March 2006, [[Ain't It Cool News]] announced that [[Dimension Films]] had bought the rights to the ''[[Cell (novel)|Cell]]'' by [[Stephen King]] and would produce a film to be directed by Roth.  In 2009, King finished the screenplay, and actors [[John Cusack]] and [[Samuel L. Jackson]] have since joined the project.

Through his company Arcade, with Eric Newman and Strike producer Marc Abraham,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/19070|title=The Power of Christ Compels Lionsgate to Purchase Retitled 'Exorcism' Flick, 'Cotton'|publisher=BloodyDisgusting}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roth produced the horror film ''[[The Last Exorcism]]'', (originally titled ''Cotton'') which was directed by [[Daniel Stamm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/18031|title=AFM '09: First Ever Images From Eli Roth's 'Cotton'!!|publisher=BloodyDisgusting}}&lt;/ref&gt; Completed in December 2009 and retitled in February 2010, ''The Last Exorcism''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/35866/lionsgate-nabs-cotton-changes-title-last-exorcism|title=Lionsgate Nabs Cotton, Changes Title to Last Exorcism|publisher=DreadCentral}}&lt;/ref&gt; cost $1.5 million to produce. It opened at more than $20 million in U.S. sales, and earned No. #1 opening spots in Canada and the UK. The film had paid for itself when rights in a few foreign territories were sold before shooting began. It earned over $40 million box office in the United States, and $70 million worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118015085.html|title=Lionsgate snags 'Last Exorcism' – Horror pic produced by Eli Roth, StudioCanal, Strike|last=Swart|first=Sharon|date=February 11, 2010|work=Variety}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Roth has talked of doing ''Trailer Trash'', another compilation of fake trailers. "''Trailer Trash'' is not a horror film," he said, "it's a comedy. It will be very R-rated and completely insane, and I'm producing it with [[Mike Fleiss]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/2009/07/09/eli-roth-not-involved-with-hostel-iii|title=Eli Roth Not Involved in Hostel III|author=Russ Fischer|publisher=Slash Film}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has also produced the 2012 [[kung fu]] film, ''[[The Man with the Iron Fist]]'', written, directed, and scored by [[The RZA]], who also stars in the film. According to Roth, Tarantino is involved as well. In an interview with CHUD, Roth said:

{{quote|This movie will have everything martial-arts fans could want, combined with RZA's superb musical talent. This project has been his dream for years, and I'm thrilled to be a part of it.

In 2015, Roth was announced as the director of the adaptation of the best-selling shark novel ''[[Meg: A Novel of Deep Terror]]'', eventually called ''[[The Meg]]''. In 2016 it was announced that he had left the project due to creative differences.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke Wolfe, [http://nerdist.com/horror-happenings-eli-roth-leaves-meg-adaptation-and-new-pinhead-announced "Horror Happenings: Eli Roth Leaves Meg Adaptation and New Pinhead Announced"], ''Nerdist'', 6 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Film commentary =====
Roth recorded an [[audio commentary]] for [[Troma]]'s 2005 DVD release of ''[[Blood Sucking Freaks]]'' with no formal credit, billed only as a "Blood and Guts Expert". The DVD is one of Troma's highest-selling.

Roth is a frequent contributor to DVD "extras" content (liner notes, video commentary) for horror-film distributors [[Grindhouse Releasing]]/[[Box Office Spectaculars]], particularly for two of his favorite films -- [[Juan Piquer Simon]]'s ''[[Pieces (1982 film)|Pieces]]'' and the North American DVD release of [[Lucio Fulci]]'s ''[[A Cat in the Brain|Cat in the Brain]]''.&lt;ref name="icons"&gt;[http://iconsoffright.com/news/2008/12/lucio_fulcis_cat_in_the_brain.html Icons of Fright News and Updates: Lucio Fulci's Cat in the Brain Coming to DVD March 31st].

==== Acting ====
Roth began his professional acting career in 1998 and has been known to play parts in the movies he produces. Roth's most notable appearance to date is his role as violent Bostonian soldier Donny "The Bear Jew" Donowitz in the 2009 Quentin Tarantino film ''[[Inglourious Basterds|Inglorious Basterds]].''

Roth's role in Quentin Tarantino's segment of 2007 film ''[[Grindhouse (film)|Grindhouse]], [[Death Proof]]'', came about because Tarantino was impressed by Roth's brief part as Justin in ''Cabin Fever''. Roth—who left preproduction on ''Hostel Part II'' in Prague and flew to [[Austin, Texas]], to film the scene at the Texas Chili Parlor—said working as an actor for Tarantino is like taking a master class in directing. He quipped that the only directors he would ever act for are people who have won the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]].

Outside of these films and his own, Roth has appeared in a cameo role as a contest emcee in [[Alexandre Aja]]'s 2010 film ''[[Piranha 3-D]]'' as well as the 2012 musical film ''[[Rock of Ages (2012 film)|Rock of Ages]]'', among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/19117|title=Eli Roth on Bloody 'Piranha' Remake, 3-D Technology|publisher=BloodyDisgusting}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roth has also appeared in several projects [[David Lynch]] directed for his website Davidlynch.com.

==== Work in television ====
Roth hosted and executive-produced an episode of [[Discovery Channel]]'s series "Curiosity", called "How Evil Are You?". The episode explored the scientific aspects of evil, with Roth undergoing a brain scan and [[DNA]] sequencing at [[U.C. Davis]] with neuropsychiatrist Dr. James Fallon.  Roth also re-created the infamous [[Milgram experiment]]s for the documentary, with results identical to those from 50 years earlier.

Roth directed the pilot of ''[[Hemlock Grove (TV series)|Hemlock Grove]]'', a horror/thriller series, that premiered on Netflix on April 19, 2013. 

He also hosts ''Shark After Dark'' on [[Discovery Channel]]'s [[Shark Week]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://deadline.com/2016/04/eli-roth-host-shark-week-shark-after-dark-discovery-channel-1201743918/ Deadline.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Other ventures ====
In 2009, Roth wrote, directed and acted in a PSA for [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] (PETA) about the link between violence against animals and violence against people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Eli Roth Stars in PETA PSA Urging People to Report Animal Abuse Immediately |url=http://horrornews.net/5502/eli-roth-stars-in-peta-psa-urging-people-to-report-animal-abuse-immediately/ |accessdate=26 June 2018 |work=Horrornews.net |date=20 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roth won a Telly Award for his spot (Public Service Category: Bronze.)

Roth is a curator of the [[EMP Museum]]'s exhibit "Can't Look Away", detailing the history of horror. He was selected, along with directors [[John Landis]] and [[Roger Corman]], to represent three generations of film directors who have shaped the genre. The installation opened in September 2011 and ran through 2014.

In September 2012, he opened a [[haunted house]], Eli Roth's Goretorium, in Las Vegas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lasvegassun.com/vegasdeluxe/2013/sep/30/eli-roths-goretorium-strip-close-oct-2-after-one-y/ The Las Vegas Sun]&lt;/ref&gt; Haunted Desert LLC, which owns Goretorium, filed for bankruptcy protection in July 2013,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2013/jul/24/roth-goretorium-bankruptcy-lawsuit-failed-celebrit/ The Las Vegas Sun]&lt;/ref&gt; and the attraction closed in October.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/oct/02/eli-roth-goretorium-closes The Guardian]&lt;/ref&gt;

Roth directed the music video for [[Snoop Lion]]'s lead single "La La La" from his [[reggae]]-genre album ''[[Reincarnated (album)|Reincarnated]]'' which was released on April 23, 2013.

In 2015, Roth partnered with Jack Davis to launch [[Crypt TV]], a digital company focused on short-form horror content.&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/hollywood/la-fi-ct-crypt-tv-funding-20180327-story.html|title=Digital horror startup Crypt TV raises $6.2 million to fund growth|work=Los Angeles Times|date=2018-03-27|accessdate=2018-03-27|author=Faughnder, Ryan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Publicity ===
''[[Men's Fitness]]'' magazine voted Roth "Most Fit Director" in their July 2006 issue, a title Roth takes very seriously. He follows a strict workout routine, which he documents on the ''Hostel'' DVDs.  Roth claims he treats every red carpet like a Milan runway, and often jokes that he only makes films as a way to live out his lifelong dream of being a male supermodel.  He spoke of his love for fashion in his interview in the October 2007 issue of Italian ''Vogue''.

Roth was profiled on the [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4]] TV show ''Icons'', and was on the cover of ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine's "Hollywood's Most Profitable Stars" issue.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

==Personal life==
Roth married Chilean actress and model [[Lorenza Izzo]] in November 2014, on the beach of [[Chile]]an town [[Zapallar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.com/celebrity/eli-roth-marries-lorenza-izzo/|title=Eli Roth Marries Lorenza Izzo|work=People|last=Corriston|first=Michele|date=November 10, 2014|accessdate=May 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple divorced in July 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Miller|first=Mike|url=https://ew.com/movies/2018/07/17/eli-roth-lorenza-izzo-divorcing/|title=Eli Roth and Lorenza Izzo are divorcing 'so we don't f---ing kill each other'|website=Entertainment Weekly|access-date=July 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
