'''Francis O'Kelly''' (28 December 1938 – 28 February 2016),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/12176759/Frank-Kelly-actor-obituary.html|title=Frank Kelly, actor - obituary|publisher=''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''|accessdate=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; better known by his stage name of '''Frank Kelly''', was an [[Irish people|Irish]] actor, singer and writer, whose career covered television, radio, theatre, music, screenwriting and film. He played [[Father Jack Hackett]] in the [[Channel Four]] sitcom ''[[Father Ted]]'', and was also the son of the cartoonist [[Charles E. Kelly (cartoonist)|Charles E. Kelly]].

==Early life and career==
Kelly was born, in 1938, in [[Blackrock, Dublin|Blackrock]], south [[County Dublin]], where he lived most of his life. His parents were Cathleen and [[Charles E. Kelly (cartoonist)|Charles E. Kelly]], cartoonist and founder of the satirical magazine ''Dublin Opinion''. He studied law and tried journalism,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/feb/28/frank-kelly-father-ted-foul-mouthed-priest-father-jack-dies|title=Frank Kelly, Father Ted's foul-mouthed priest, dies aged 77|first=Hannah|last=Ellis-Petersen|date=28 February 2016|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|accessdate=23 April 2017|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; before moving on to acting. He worked at Dublin’s [[Eblana Theatre]] with [[Cecil Sheridan]] and as a feed to [[Jack Cruise|Cruise]]. Other work included [[pantomime]] and reviews.&lt;ref name="irishtimes"&gt;{{cite news|title=Late Frank Kelly was loved by generations of Irish people|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/culture/late-frank-kelly-was-loved-by-generations-of-irish-people-1.2552681|accessdate=29 February 2016|work=The Irish Times|date=29 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kelly's first film role was as an uncredited prison officer in ''[[The Italian Job]]'' (1969), escorting Charlie Croker ([[Michael Caine]]) out of prison&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; in the film's opening sequence.

He starred in the popular [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]] children's programme ''[[Wanderly Wagon]]'' alongside [[Eugene Lambert]] and Nora O'Mahoney from 1968 to 1982, playing a number of different characters and writing many of the scripts.&lt;ref name=journal/&gt; It was Kelly's work on ''[[Hall's Pictorial Weekly]]'' (1970–1982) that established him as one of Ireland's most recognisable faces. He memorably portrayed councillor Parnell Mooney, a send-up of a backwards local authority figure in rural Ireland. In 1974, Kelly won a [[Jacob's Award]] for his work on the series.

In the early 1980s, he was featured in the RTÉ TV programme for those learning Irish ''[[Anois is Aris]]''. At the end of the programme he spoke into a telephone, gradually introducing Irish phrases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED232437&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=ED232437|title=Learning Irish with "Anois is Aris." CLCS Occasional Paper No. 6, Winter 1982-3. A Report on the Background, Attitudes, Expectations, and Learning Experience of a Volunteer Group of Course Participants.|first=Devitt, S. M. |last=And Others|publisher=|accessdate=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, he appeared in the Irish thriller film ''[[Taffin]]''.

==''Father Ted''==
Kelly was best known outside Ireland for playing [[Father Jack Hackett]] in the comedy series ''[[Father Ted]]'', which aired in the United Kingdom from April 1995 to May 1998. Father Jack is an old and offensively rambunctious priest who usually shouts only "[[feck]]!", "arse!", "drink!" and "girls!" and the occasional scream of "what!" and "women's knickers".

For his role in ''Father Ted'', he wore [[contact lens]]es (to show Father Jack's blank eye). People would not eat lunch with him during filming if he was in his Father Jack make-up&lt;ref name="scripts"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Linehan|first1=Graham|last2=Mathews|first2=Arthur|title=Father Ted: the complete scripts|year=1999|page=120|publisher=Boxtree|location=London|isbn=0752218506}}&lt;/ref&gt; because the false flaky skin he was wearing would fall off into the food.

Interviewing Kelly in 1997 for ''[[The Irish Times]]'', Deirdre Falvey said of him: "In person he could not be further from Father Jack. Urbane, articulate, thoughtful, fit (he swims and hikes), charming company, full of stories, and quite serious, though his conversation is punctuated by the occasional burst of laughter—he is reputably a great slagger with colleagues, and is very well liked." Kelly himself said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I like humour — but I'm very suspicious of people who laugh all the time, because they never listen to what you're saying, they always — have another agenda and they generally have no sense of humour. The most untrustworthy body language I know is that of the person who laughs all the time. That terrifies me. People with no sense or a very limited sense of humour I am very wary of too, because it's not a sign of great intelligence to be without a sense of humour. If you've no sense of irony you haven't a great decision making capacity because you must see the possibilities of the downside of any decision. Without perspective you can't have any wisdom, so it frightens me when I meet captains of industry or whatever who have virtually no sense of humour. That's the kind of person I find dismaying.&lt;ref name=falvey&gt;{{cite web|author=Deirdre Falvey |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/jack-of-all-trades-1.28072 |title=JACK of all trades |publisher=Irishtimes.com |date=1 February 1997 |accessdate=1 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Later career==
From 1999 to 2001, Kelly starred in ''[[Glenroe]]'' as Maurice and played Henry Doyle (father of [[Pierce Brosnan]]'s Desmond Doyle) in ''[[Evelyn (film)|Evelyn]]'' (2002). He appeared in the film ''Rat'' in 2000, as a priest called Father Pickle in the TV series ''[[Lexx]]'' (2001), and also in a short film, ''[[Yu Ming Is Ainm Dom]]'', in 2003. That same year, he had a major role as [[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]], leader of the Labour Party, in the UK Television drama ''[[The Deal (2003 film)|The Deal]]''.

In 2007, he acted in the [[TG4]] political drama ''Running Mate'', about an election campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iftn.ie/whoswho/Producers/whoswhosub/filmproducers/?act1=record&amp;only=1&amp;aid=73&amp;rid=4279794&amp;tpl=archnews&amp;force=|title=1 October Start For TG4's ‘Running Mate'|publisher=IFTN|date=25 Sep 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also appeared in the TG4 series ''Paddywhackery''.

On 29 September 2010, it was announced that Kelly had joined [[ITV1]] soap ''[[Emmerdale]]'', playing the role of Dermot, [[Declan Macey]]'s father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s12/emmerdale/news/a279434/emmerdale-reveals-new-home-farm-dynasty.html|title='Emmerdale' reveals new Home Farm dynasty|publisher=Digital Spy|date=30 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kelly left the soap after five months of filming because he missed his family in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://primetime.unrealitytv.co.uk/father-teds-frank-kelly-has-quit-emmerdale/|title=Father Ted's Frank Kelly has quit Emmerdale|publisher=Unreality TV|date=30 April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110504164148/http://primetime.unrealitytv.co.uk/father-teds-frank-kelly-has-quit-emmerdale/|archivedate=4 May 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A regular stage actor, Kelly toured extensively in the United States and Canada. He provided [[voice-overs]] and in his television advertising work, appeared with "Mr Tayto" in an advertising campaign for [[Tayto (Republic of Ireland)|Tayto]] crisps.

In 2014, he appeared as judge Justice Cannon in ''[[Mrs. Brown's Boys D'Movie]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kirsty Blake |url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/books/its-back-to-the-parochial-house-for-ted-star-kelly-30140430.html |title=It's back to the parochial house for 'Ted' star Kelly |publisher=Independent.ie |date=31 March 2014 |accessdate=28 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2015, Kelly published an autobiography called ''The Next Gig''. His reminiscences include those of acting colleagues including [[Pierce Brosnan]] and [[Michael Caine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.currach.ie/index.php/the-next-gig.html|title=The Next Gig|publisher=currach.ie|accessdate=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Radio comedy==
Many of his radio sketches originated from his weekday [[RTÉ Radio 1|RTÉ]] radio show ''The Glen Abbey Show'' in the 1970s until the 1990s. Kelly played the part of a [[culchie]], "Gobnait O'Lúnasa", the sketches typically started with the sound of him putting coins in an old freckle coin box, and when the phone rang and was answered, his words were, "Hello! Guess who? Is that you Nuala?" Kelly acted the part of an English [[BBC]] reporter interviewing rural inhabitants about local customs, such as watching bacon being sliced, or "ha-hooing" (shouting a [[Rebel yell]]) competitions. The village was called Ballykilferret and described by the BBC man as being in "the Republic of Eer-ah" (a mispronunciation of [[Éire]]).

==Music career==
In 1982, Kelly released a single, "Christmas Countdown", a [[Novelty song|comedy monologue]]  based on the Christmas song "[[The Twelve Days of Christmas (song)|The Twelve Days of Christmas]]" and credited to the  pseudonymic Gobnait O’Lúnasa. It reached number eight in the [[Irish Singles Chart]] in 1982, and peaked at #26 in the [[UK Singles Chart]] in 1984. He performed the single live on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' on 5 January of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chartstats.com/songinfo.php?id=11272 |title=Frank Kelly – Christmas Countdown |publisher=Chart Stats |accessdate=26 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.simplyeighties.com/frank-kelly---christmas-countdown.php#.WTxw2fnyvct]&lt;/ref&gt; The single was the opening track on the later album ''Comedy Countdown''.

In 2000 he released ''Comedy Countdown'', an album featuring some of his sketches taken from ''The Glen Abbey Show''. Tracks included the "Ayatollah Ceili Band" (a pun on [[The Tulla Céilí Band]]), "Magnum Farce", "Incoming Call", "Festive Spirit", "Hymn of Praise", "Call of the Wild", "Festive Note" and "Siege Mentality".

==Death==
Kelly died on 28 February 2016, after suffering a heart attack. He revealed he had [[Parkinson's disease]] in October 2015, and was recovering from [[Colorectal cancer|bowel cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-35682191 |title='Father Jack' actor Kelly dies aged 77 |publisher=BBC News |date=28 February 2016 |accessdate=28 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had previously survived [[skin cancer]].&lt;ref name=journal&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/frank-kelly-rip-father-jack-2630816-Feb2016/ |title=Beloved actor Frank Kelly has died aged 77 |publisher=Thejournal.ie |date=28 February 2016 |accessdate=28 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His death came exactly 18 years after the death of his ''Father Ted'' co-star [[Dermot Morgan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sky.com/story/1650208/father-jack-actor-frank-kelly-dies-aged-77 |title=Father Jack Actor Frank Kelly Dies Aged 77 |publisher=News.sky.com |date=28 February 2016 |accessdate=28 February 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160228190342/http://news.sky.com/story/1650208/father-jack-actor-frank-kelly-dies-aged-77 |archivedate=28 February 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/ten/news/2016/0228/771346-acting-great-frank-kelly-dies-aged-77/ |title=Acting great Frank Kelly dies aged 77 - RTÉ Ten |publisher=Rte.ie |date= |accessdate=28 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking at Kelly's funeral, [[Michael D. Higgins]], the President of Ireland, said, "He will forever be remembered for his roles in the theatre and will be recalled with great affection and fondness for his roles on television, including in ''Wanderly Wagon'', ''Glenroe'' and the much-loved ''Hall's Pictorial Weekly''."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/actor-frank-kelly-s-funeral-underway-in-dublin-1.2556657|title=Actor Frank Kelly’s funeral underway in Dublin|website=The Irish Times|language=en-US|access-date=2 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kelly was survived by Bairbre, his wife of 51 years who was a drama teacher, and by their five daughters, two sons and 17 grandchildren.&lt;ref name="irishtimes"/&gt;
