'''Stephen James Merchant''' (born 24 November 1974) is an English writer, director, radio presenter, comedian, and actor.

Merchant is best known for his collaborations with [[Ricky Gervais]] and [[Karl Pilkington]], as the co-writer and co-director of the popular British sitcom ''[[The Office (UK TV series)|The Office]]'' (2001–2003), co-writer and co-star of ''[[Extras (TV series)|Extras]]'' (2005–2007) and co-host of ''[[The Ricky Gervais Show]]'' in its radio, podcast, audiobook and television formats; the radio version won a bronze [[Sony Award]]. He is also known for his voice role as [[Wheatley (Portal)|Wheatley]] in the 2011 video game ''[[Portal 2]]''.

Merchant appeared as himself in the [[BBC]] series ''[[Life's Too Short (TV series)|Life's Too Short]]'' (2011–2013), which he co-wrote and co-directed. He also voiced the computer program ConRad on ''[[The Simpsons]]'' in the 2016 episode "[[The Girl Code]]", co-developed the [[Sky1]] travel series ''[[An Idiot Abroad]]'' (2010–2011) and performs as a stand-up comedian. He starred in his first play, [[Richard Bean]]'s ''[[The Mentalists (play)|The Mentalists]]'', at London's [[Wyndham's Theatre]] from July to August 2015. His varied endeavors have earned him three [[BAFTA Awards]], four [[British Comedy Awards]] and a [[Primetime Emmy Award]].

Merchant had his first dramatic role in a film when he was cast as [[Caliban (Marvel Comics)|Caliban]] in the [[superhero film]] ''[[Logan (2017 film)|Logan]]'' (2017).

==Early life==
Merchant was born in [[Hanham]], [[County of Avon|Avon]], the son of nursery nurse Jane Elaine (''née'' Hibbs) and insurance representative Ronald John Merchant.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&amp;grid=&amp;xml=/education/2007/08/18/fafamdet118.xml Family detective: Stephen Merchant], Telegraph.co.uk; accessed 8 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[Hanham High School]]&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/11-bristol-celebrities-go-school-17024 Where did these 11 Bristol celebrities go to school?]",''Bristol Post'', 2 April 2017 (Accessed 4th April 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; and later the [[University of Warwick]] in [[Coventry]] from 1993 to 1996, where he received a [[British undergraduate degree classification#Upper second-class honours|2:1]] [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in Film and Literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cambridge.tab.co.uk/2011/06/08/10-questions-stephen-merchant/|title=10 Questions: Stephen Merchant|first=Holly|last=Stevenson|work=The Tab|date=8 June 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221083727/http://cambridge.tab.co.uk/2011/06/08/10-questions-stephen-merchant/|archivedate=21 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Merchant was a former film reviewer on the student radio station [[Radio Warwick]], where he began his broadcasting career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/alumni/ouralumni/notable2/merchant|title=Funny you asked|publisher=University of Warwick website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of Merchant's "posse" included film critic [[James King (film critic)|James King]], Dan Warren, Neil the Maskell, and Geraint the Welshman. Recently, a number of tapes of ''The Steve Show'' have been rediscovered and are being distributed on various Merchant fan sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://steveshow.wordpress.com/ |title=The Steve Show |publisher=Steveshow.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=23 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===Pre–2001===
Merchant began his career performing stand-up comedy at Bristol's Comedy Box, where, he recalls, "The first week I did really well. The second week I died on my arse. I realised that stand-up was not that easy after all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Byrnes |first1=Sholto |title=Stephen Merchant: The Office boy |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/stephen-merchant-the-office-boy-299623.html |accessdate=19 August 2018 |work=Independent |date=17 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also appeared as a contestant on a 1997 episode of the TV game show ''[[Blockbusters (UK game show)|Blockbusters]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=I'll have a TV career please, Bob: four famous Blockbusters contestants|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2012-05-14/ill-have-a-tv-career-please-bob-four-famous-blockbusters-contestants|publisher=Radio Times|accessdate=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and worked for a short time as a DJ for [[Radio Caroline]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stephen Merchant|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/comics/s/33386/stephen_merchant?review=33386&amp;type=3|publisher=Chortle|accessdate=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Merchant met [[Ricky Gervais]] for the first time in 1997, when Gervais (then in the position of "Head of Speech" at the London radio station [[XFM London]]) hired Merchant as his assistant.&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harvey|first1=Chris|title=Stephen Merchant interview: 'I'll probably get in trouble for saying this...'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/theatre-features/11700874/stephen-merchant-interview-mentalists.html|accessdate=19 November 2015|work=Telegraph|date=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Gervais said later that he had called Merchant for an interview simply because it was the first [[Curriculum vitae|CV]] handed to him.) Merchant and Gervais hosted a Saturday afternoon radio show together from January through to August 1998, when both of them left XFM as it was bought by the [[Capital Radio Group]]. In the same year, Merchant was a finalist at the Daily Telegraph Open Mic Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stephen Merchant Stands Up|url=http://londonist.com/2007/03/stephen_merchan|publisher=Londonist|accessdate=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Merchant worked for seven years at XFM 104.9. The Saturday show never had a large audience; Gervais says "It's a tin pot radio station... It's not even the biggest radio station in the building." He created the features 'Hip Hop Hooray', 'Make Ricky Gervais Laugh' and 'Song for the Ladies'. After leaving XFM, Merchant began a production course at the BBC. As part of his coursework, he enlisted Gervais to perform in a 30-minute short film, "Seedy Boss," which became the earliest inspiration for their sitcom ''[[The Office (UK TV series)|The Office]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jeffries|first1=Stuart|title=The Guardian profile: Ricky Gervais|url=https://www.theguardian.com/profiles/story/0,,1250074,.html|accessdate=19 November 2015|work=Guardian|date=30 January 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; They collaborated on a sitcom pilot called ''Golden Years'' featuring a manager suffering a mid-life crisis; the pilot aired on Channel 4's ''[[Comedy Lab]]'' series in September 1998,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Comedy Lab: Season 2, Episode 6 Golden Years|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0475285/|publisher=IMDB|accessdate=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but failed to find further success.

===2001–2003 (''The Office'' and return to XFM)===
In mid-2001, [[BBC Two]] aired the first series of ''The Office'', co-written and co-directed by Merchant and Gervais and starring the latter as paper sales office manager [[David Brent]]; the show initially received low ratings. Beginning in September 2001, Merchant and Gervais returned to XFM as co-hosts of ''[[The Ricky Gervais Show]]'', another Saturday afternoon programme, which led to their fruitful relationship with producer [[Karl Pilkington]].&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt;

They took a break from the radio show in mid-2002 in order to film the second series of ''The Office'', which aired that year; in addition to writing and directing the show, Merchant made a cameo performance in the episode "Charity" as a friend of [[Gareth Keenan]]'s character known by the name Oggy or Oggmonster. (Merchant's father also appears in multiple episodes as an office handyman named Gordon.) Merchant also directed a sitcom pilot called ''[[The Last Chancers]]'', which aired on ''Comedy Lab'' in November 2002 and became a five-part series broadcast in December on [[E4 (channel)|E4]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Last Chancers|url=http://curtisbrown.co.uk/client/anthony-macmurray/work/the-last-chancers-1|publisher=Curtis Brown|accessdate=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Merchant and Gervais continued to host ''The Ricky Gervais Show'' through 2003, taking another break to film the ''Office'' Christmas special, which aired that December. The radio show went off the air indefinitely in January 2004. During 2004, Merchant appeared in a recurring role as a chef on ''[[Garth Marenghi's Darkplace]]'' and in a cameo on ''[[Green Wing]]'', and served as a script associate on the [[Chris Morris (satirist)|Chris Morris]] and [[Charlie Brooker]] sitcom ''[[Nathan Barley]]''. The same year, ''The Office'' aired in the [[U.S.]] to critical acclaim. It went on to win the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series – Musical or Comedy]] which both Merchant and Gervais accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Office celebrates two Golden Globe triumphs|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/bbcworldwide/worldwidestories/pressreleases/2004/01_january/office_golden_globes.shtml|publisher=BBC|accessdate=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed in 2005 by a 4th series of the radio show, consisting of six episodes.

===U.S. series of ''The Office''===
In March 2005, the [[The Office (U.S. TV series)|American version of ''The Office'']] premiered, with Merchant and Gervais credited as executive producers. They would later co-write the third-season episode "[[The Convict]]", and Merchant would go on to direct the fifth-season episode "[[Customer Survey]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Office: Season 5, Episode 6 Customer Survey|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1248750/|publisher=IMDB|accessdate=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Podcast series===
In December 2005, with sponsorship by ''[[The Guardian]]'', Merchant, Gervais and Pilkington began recording a weekly podcast (also called ''[[The Ricky Gervais Show]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Plumplard.com August 2004|url=http://www.rickygervais.com/podcasts2.php|title=Ricky Gervais... Obviously|publisher=Rickygervais.com|accessdate=17 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout its first series (through 20 February 2006), the podcast was consistently ranked the most popular in the world, and was certified as the most-downloaded of all time by [[Guinness World Records]]. Two more series and three special installments (the "Podfather Trilogy") were recorded in 2006, with the final episode released on Christmas Eve. In late 2008, they recorded four more podcasts and began a series of audiobooks examining Pilkington's perspective on various subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stephen Merchant Talks|url=http://www.iamrogue.com/news/interviews/item/8097-iar-exclusive-interview-stephen-merchant-talks-movie-43-the-future-of-an-idiot-abroad-and-the-genius-of-karl-pilkington.html|publisher=I Am Rogue|accessdate=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Extras''===
In July 2005, following a brief return of the XFM radio show (filling in for [[Adam and Joe]]), Gervais and Merchant's new sitcom ''[[Extras (TV series)|Extras]]'' premiered on BBC2. The series features Merchant in a supporting role as [[Darren Lamb]], the incompetent agent to struggling actor [[Andy Millman]], played by Gervais. Series 2 of ''Extras'' aired in late 2006, followed by a Christmas special in December 2007; all three installments aired on [[HBO]] in the United States. Merchant won a 2006 [[British Comedy Award]] for Best TV Actor for his performance as Lamb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Owen Gibson, media correspondent|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,,1971460,00.html|title=Tate and Merchant win comedy awards|work=The Guardian|location=UK|date=14 December 2006|accessdate=17 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Steve Show''===
[[File:StephenMerchantJan2011.jpg|thumb|right|Merchant in January 2011]]
In January 2007, Merchant began hosting his own radio show on [[BBC 6 Music]], airing weekly on Sunday afternoons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2006/11_november/30/merchant.shtml|title=Stephen Merchant presents new show for BBC 6 Music|publisher=BBC|accessdate=17 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of comedy, ''The Steve Show'' focused on music and particularly "new music", defined by Merchant as "music you've not heard before." Many of the songs on the show were suggested by listeners or co-presenters. The show also featured several of his friends, including his housemate,  his childhood friend, as well as actor [[Rufus Wright|Rufus Gerrard-Wright]] (who also appeared in an episode of ''[[Extras (TV series)|Extras]]''). A spring search for a "she-J" resulted in the addition of former ''[[Byker Grove]]'' actor Sammy T. Dobson&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/sammy-dobson/person/95277/appearances.html|title=Sammy Dobson|publisher=Tv.com|accessdate=17 March 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110403092514/http://www.tv.com/sammy-dobson/person/95277/appearances.html|archivedate=3 April 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; joining the ensemble. "The Steve Show" aired for four seasons and concluded in May 2009.

===Stand-up===
Merchant began performing stand-up comedy in the late 1990s to critical success, though he decided to focus more on his work with writing partner [[Ricky Gervais]] after the success of ''The Office''. Merchant returned to stand-up with a nationwide tour of the United Kingdom in September 2011, under the title ''Hello Ladies''. The tour, which ended in New York,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/15/arts/television/stephen-merchant-moves-from-gervaiss-shadow-to-stand-up.html?_r=0 Profile], nytimes.com; accessed 8 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; was later released on DVD. In late 2012, the tour continued in Australia and New Zealand. Merchant performed his first-ever stand-up tour of Scandinavia in October 2014, performing in 11 different cities as part of a European festival circuit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comedyfesteurope.com/tickets Profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107002954/http://www.comedyfesteurope.com/tickets/ |date=7 November 2014 }}, comedyfesteurope.com; accessed 8 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Hello Ladies''===
Merchant's sitcom ''[[Hello Ladies]]'' premiered on 29 September 2013 on [[HBO]], in which he played Stuart Pritchard, a website designer in Los Angeles who unsuccessfully chases beautiful women. It was adapted from his stand-up show of the same name. Merchant's frequent partner Ricky Gervais was not involved in any part of the show which was instead written by Merchant, Lee Eisenberg and Gene Stupnitsky. After its initial run of eight episodes, HBO did not renew the show for a second season&lt;ref&gt;[http://tvseriesfinale.com/tv-show/hello-ladies-cancelled-no-season-two-31327 ''Hello Ladies'' not renewed by HBO], tvseriesfinale.com; accessed 8 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; but aired a special movie on 22 November 2014 that served as the series' last episode.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stephenmerchant.com Stephen Merchant official website]; accessed 8 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other work===
Merchant has played small roles in the films ''[[Hot Fuzz]]'' (2007), ''[[Run Fatboy Run]]'' (2007), and ''[[The Invention of Lying]]'' (2009). He has a supporting role in the 2010 film ''[[Tooth Fairy (2010 film)|Tooth Fairy]]''. On television, Merchant made a cameo appearance in a non-speaking role on the sixth-season premiere of ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]''; he also starred as a sports commentator in the unaired pilot ''No Skillz''. In 2009, Merchant and Gervais collaborated on the film ''[[Cemetery Junction (film)|Cemetery Junction]]'', set in [[working class|working-class]] England in the 1970s, which received mixed to positive reviews on its release in 2010.

Later in 2010, Gervais and Merchant wrote, and had cameo roles in, ''[[Life's Too Short (TV series)|Life's Too Short]]'', a television show starring [[Warwick Davis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warwickdavis.co.uk/lifes-too-short-bbc-pilot-1|title=Warwick Davis official website|publisher=Warwickdavis.co.uk|accessdate=23 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For television, Merchant and Gervais also produced ''[[An Idiot Abroad]]''.

In 2013 he starred in ''[[I Give It a Year]]'' as the best man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stephenmerchant.com/news/2012/11/22/i-give-it-a-year-next-year|title=I give it a year next year|publisher=www.stephenmerchant.com|date=22 November 2012|deadurl=yes|accessdate=1 February 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130203212624/http://www.stephenmerchant.com/news/2012/11/22/i-give-it-a-year-next-year/|archivedate=3 February 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2011, Merchant appeared alongside many other comedians at the 'Free Fringe Benefit' at the [[Bloomsbury Theatre]], London, in a show of stand-up to benefit the Free Fringe at the Edinburgh Comedy Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Free Fringe Benefit 2011|url=http://www.officiallondontheatre.co.uk/london-shows/show/item113641/Free-Fringe-Benefit-2011/|publisher=Official London Theatre|accessdate=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
