'''Alan Carney''' (December 22, 1909 &amp;ndash; May 2, 1973) was an American actor and comedian.

==Biography==
Alan Carney was born '''David Boughal''' in [[Brooklyn, New York]], on December 22, 1909.

He performed in [[vaudeville]] for years. After making his first film, 1941's ''Convoy'', Carney signed a contract at [[RKO Pictures]] and appeared in choice supporting roles in such films as ''[[Mr. Lucky (film)|Mr. Lucky]]''.

In 1943, Carney teamed up with [[Wally Brown]] as RKO's answer to [[Abbott and Costello]]. In addition to their inexpensive starring vehicles, [[Brown and Carney]] co-starred in ''[[Step Lively (1944 film)|Step Lively]]'', a musical remake of the [[Marx Brothers]] film ''[[Room Service (1938 film)|Room Service]]''. Wally played Chico's part, while Alan Carney filled in for Harpo; the "Groucho" role was essayed by [[George Murphy]]. The comedy team was also featured on a live USO tour arranged by the studio.

After 1946's ''[[Genius at Work]]'', RKO terminated the team's contracts. Alan Carney continued in films and TV as a supporting player, working prolifically at Disney Studios in the 1960s and 1970s. One of Carney's best latter-day roles was as Mayor Dawgmeat in the 1959 musical film ''[[Li'l Abner (1959 film)|Li'l Abner]]''.

Carney appeared with Wally Brown in ''[[Who Was That Lady?]]'' (1960) and in Walt Disney's ''[[The Absent-Minded Professor]]'' (1961), but they never appeared in the same scenes together.  The duo was slated to be reunited for ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'', but Brown died not long before filming began.
       
Alan Carney made his last film appearance in Walt Disney Productions' ''[[Herbie Rides Again]]'' in 1974.

He died in [[Van Nuys, California]], of a heart attack at the age of 63 from the excitement of winning the [[daily double]] at [[Hollywood Park Racetrack]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Alan Carney Dies.
