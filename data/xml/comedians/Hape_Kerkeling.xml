'''Hans Peter Wilhelm "Hape" Kerkeling''' ({{IPA-de|ˈhaːpə ˈkɛʁkəlɪŋ}}; born 9 December 1964, in [[Recklinghausen]], [[Germany]]) is a [[German people|German]] [[actor]], [[Television presenter|presenter]] and [[comedian]] with Dutch roots.

== Career ==
At secondary school in Recklinghausen, Hape Kerkeling and some fellow students formed a band (''Gesundfutter'', meaning: health fodder) and published a record (''Hawaii'').

Kerkeling started his career as a comedian in radio, working for various German broadcasting companies, such as [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk|WDR]] and [[Bayerischer Rundfunk|BR]].

The real breakthrough came in 1984/85 when, still aged only 19, Kerkeling got a role in the ''[[Känguru]]'' [sic] [[television comedy]] show (the German word for ''[[kangaroo]]'' deliberately spelt without an "h" at the end although this broke the spelling rules at that time). The best-known character in this show was the little boy ''Hannilein'', played by Kerkeling, an irritating child with red hair in a pudding-basin style, [[Overall|dungarees]] and sitting on giant-sized chairs, who commented on the world of adults.

Later came guest appearances and sketches on the [[Radio Bremen]] show ''[[Extratour]]''. Then in 1989 Kerkeling started up his own comedy TV show, ''[[Total Normal]]'' (''Totally Normal'') along with pianist [[Achim Hagemann]]. This show, a satirical spoof on prime-time TV-Shows, had a totally new format and was awarded several television prizes such as the [[Goldene Kamera]], the [[Adolf-Grimme-Preis]] and the [[Bayerischer Fernsehpreis]].

On the show, Kerkeling made television history on 25 April 1991 when he dressed up as Queen [[Beatrix of the Netherlands]] on a state visit to [[Berlin]] and almost managed to get into [[Schloss Bellevue]] to meet the [[President of Germany]] for lunch. The satirical song from this show, ''Das ganze Leben ist ein Quiz'' (''All life is a quiz'') made it into the German pop charts.

On 10 December 1991, in a German television talkshow, the filmmaker [[Rosa von Praunheim]] revealed that Kerkeling, among others, was [[gay]]. Kerkeling's comment on the ensuing fuss (mostly in the [[gutter press]]) was that while anyone of a more sensitive nature than him would probably have climbed into the bath with a hairdryer, he could not see the point: they would be dragging another poor soul through the dirt the next day anyway.

In 1992 Kerkeling's first film came out: ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Kein Pardon|de}}'', which he directed and starred in, as well as helping to write the script.

In 1992 Kerkeling turned down an offer by the big [[public broadcasting]] company [[ZDF]] to work on the immensely popular prime-time show ''[[Wetten, dass..?]]'' and instead, without his previous partner Hagemann, moved to the independent television sector with the show ''Cheese''. This was similar in concept to ''Total Normal'' and viewing figures were relatively high; still this is considered as his first flop.

In the second half of the 90s, Kerkeling worked once more for [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]], presenting the show ''Warmumsherz'' (''Heartwarming''), and filmed several television films (''[[Club Las Piranjas]]'' (1995), ''[[Willi und die Windzors]]'', 1996; ''Die Oma ist tot'', 1997).

In 1999 Kerkeling returned to success with his [[Sat.1]] show ''[[Darüber lacht die Welt]]'' (''What makes the world laugh''). He also presented the yearly fundraising gala for the German [[AIDS]] fund ''[[Deutsche AIDS-Hilfe]]''. In 2003 he was awarded the [[Deutscher Fernsehpreis]] (German Television Prize) in the category ''Best Entertainment Presenter''.

In January 2004 Kerkeling made another film entitled ''[[Samba in Mettmann]]'', which is set in [[Mettmann]] in [[North Rhine Westphalia]]. In May 2004, and a year later in May 2005, he presented the ''Großer Deutsch-Test'' (a national test show for German grammar and spelling) and in October 2004 the ''Großer Deutschlandtest'' (a test about people's knowledge of Germany). In April and May 2006 he presented the live TV show ''Let's Dance'', the German version of ''[[Strictly Come Dancing]]''/''[[Dancing with the Stars]]'', with [[Nazan Eckes]].

German broadcaster ZDF started the production of Kerkeling's ''Ein Mann, ein Fjord!'' (A Man, A [[Fjord]]!) in May 2008, directed by Angelo Colagrossi and written by Kerkeling, Angelo Colagrossi and Angelina Maccarone. Starring Jürgen Tarrach, Anneke Kim Sarnau, Matthias Brandt and Horst Krause the film portrays Kerkeling as Horst Schlämmer, Uschi Blum and Gisela. The movie premiered on 21 January 2009, on ZDF.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130212213420/http://www.zdf.de/ZDF/zdfportal/web/ZDF.de/Ein-Mann-ein-Fjord/22567596/22593806/3efd17/Ein-Mann-ein-Fjord.html Ein Mann, ein Fjord!, zdf.de]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a survey by the television station [[Kabel 1]] in 2005, Kerkeling made it into the top ten favourite faces on German television; the only other two presenters were [[Günther Jauch]] and [[Thomas Gottschalk]].

In 2001 Kerkeling went on a [[pilgrimage]], following the [[Way of St James]] for {{convert|650|km}} to [[Santiago de Compostela]]. In June 2006 his book ''Ich bin dann mal weg'' (''I'm off for a bit, then''), his diary of this pilgrimage, was top of the ''[[Der Spiegel|Spiegel]]'' magazine [[non-fiction]] bestseller list. By May 2008 it had sold 3 million copies.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.welt.de/kultur/article2020311/So_wanderte_Hape_Kerkeling_zum_Bestseller.html So wanderte Hape Kerkeling zum Bestseller]'', [[die Welt]]&lt;/ref&gt; It appeared in English in 2009 with the title ''I'm Off Then: Losing and Finding Myself on the Camino De Santiago''. It has also been translated into French, Italian, Dutch, Polish, Latvian, Spanish, and Chinese.

Hape Kerkeling lives with his life partner and co-author [[Angelo Colagrossi]] in [[Berlin]]. Colagrossi wrote a large number of texts and sketches for ''Total Normal'' and other shows, and co-directed the films ''Kein Pardon'', ''Willi und die Windzors'', ''Die Oma ist tot'', ''Samba in Mettmann'' and ''Ein Mann, ein Fjord!''.

In March 2011 Kerkeling announced that he and Colagrossi were getting a divorce.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/leute/0,1518,749310,00.html ''Kerkeling trennt sich-Isch bin solo'', Spiegel Online on 6 March 2011].&lt;/ref&gt;

Since spring 2005 Kerkeling has presented the show ''Hape trifft!'' (which is ambiguous in the German language and may be translated as ''Hape hits the spot!'' or ''Hape meets!'') show, produced by [[Günther Jauch]]'s production team ''i&amp;u TV'' on [[RTL Television|RTL]].

In 2013 Hape Kerkeling spoke and sang the German version of Olaf, a snowman from the new Disney movie [[Frozen (2013 film)]].

==Characters==

=== Horst Schlämmer ===
Horst Schlämmer is one of Kerkeling's current characters (and the most successful), the deputy [[Managing editor|editor]] of the fictitious newspaper ''[[Grevenbroich]]er Tagblatt''. His motto is to "get up close and ask tough questions". Dressed in a grey trenchcoat and with a small black [[Handbag|manbag]] on his arm, he holds interviews at real events such as the [[Bundestag]] elections.

Schlämmer speaks to interviewees in an overfamiliar manner, using ''du'' for ''you'' rather than the polite ''Sie'', and addressing them as ''Schätzelein'' (''sweetheart''). He seems to think he is a [[sex symbol]], attempting to kiss female interviewees despite his loose false teeth. To impress women, he boasts that he earns three thousand ([[euro]]) net a month.

On the [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]]'s [[Harald Schmidt]] show, Kerkeling explained his methods. Before a Schlämmer interview, he said, he pours a few drops of strong liquor over his coat, to give the interviewee the impression he or she is being interviewed by a real reporter, but with an alcohol problem, prompting a real response.

The [[single (music)|single]] ''Schätzelein'' came out at the start of 2006, including the songs ''Schätzelein'' and ''Meine letzte Zigarette'' (''My last cigarette'').

In May 2006 Schlämmer appeared on ''[[Wer wird Millionär? (Germany)|Wer wird Millionär]]'' (the German ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]]'') as a celebrity candidate, and became the first person to persuade [[Günther Jauch]], the presenter of ''Wer wird Millionär'', into the contestant's seat. The two made 500,000 euro for a good cause (German AIDS Foundation).

In 2007 a computer game "Weisse Bescheid?!", based on Horst Schlämmer, was released.

In 2009 Kerkeling announced a [[mockumentary]] about Horst Schlämmer running for German Chancellor. It was scheduled to be released to cinemas in Germany shortly before the [[German federal election, 2009|German federal election of 2009]]. According to a BBC piece, Horst Schlämmer would receive 18% of the German vote due partly to his Obama inspired slogan, "Yes weekend".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8214217.stm |title='German Borat' shakes up election |publisher=BBC News |date=21 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hannilein ===
Kerkeling, in ''Kerkelings Kinderstunde'' (Kerkelings children's hour), as a cheeky child of preschool age named ''Hannilein'', with red tousled hair and a [[bib overall]], sits on oversized chairs and comments on the adult world.

===Evje van Dampen===
Is a female Dutch relationship counselor who meets various German celebrities (such as [[Günther Jauch]] or [[Udo Jürgens]]).

=== Siggi Schwäbli ===
Siegfried (Siggi) Schwäbli is a character who first appeared in 1990 in some episodes of ''Total Normal''. Slow-witted, short-sighted and with glasses made of plastic blocks, Siggi constantly puts his foot in it and often has no idea what is going on. At the ''Cannstatter Volksfest'' festival in [[Stuttgart]], for example, he went on the [[Dark ride|ghost train]] with [[Barbara Schöneberger]], a TV host, and almost passed out with fear.

=== Gisela ===
Gisela has recently been discovered by Horst Schlaemmer to act in commercials for ''Krueger Coffee''. She has been happily married to her husband, Wolfgang since 1983.
