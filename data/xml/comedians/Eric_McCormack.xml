"I remember after the first performance of that... I knew where to fit in. That was the beginning of my life as an actor. It changed me in that the concept of any other options disappeared.

"It was all I wanted, to be a classical actor for the rest of my life, but during the last couple of years I was there, I started to realise that it wasn't for me.

===''Will &amp; Grace''===
McCormack received his breakthrough role in 1998 when he was cast as [[gay]] lawyer [[Will Truman]] on the [[NBC]] sitcom ''[[Will &amp; Grace]]''. McCormack said that when the part came along, he was convinced he was right for the role. "At the end of the audition, [[Max Mutchnick]], co-creator and executive producer of the show said 'That was perfect. Just to let you know, you never have to be more gay than that.'"&lt;ref name="mclean"/&gt; He explained that when he first read the script, "what hit me immediately was that this was me. I mean, [[sexual orientation]] aside, Will was so much like me. He's a great host, he's relatively funny and he has great friends and he's a good friend to them&amp;nbsp;... the gay issue just wasn't really a big thing."&lt;ref name="Thompson1998"&gt;{{cite news|title=He's Gay, She's Not|last=Thompson|first=Kevin|date=1998-09-21 |work=[[The Palm Beach Post]] |page=1D}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show debuted on September 21, 1998, and was watched by almost 8.6&amp;nbsp;million American viewers.&lt;ref name="renamed_from_1998_on_20101220232705"&gt;{{cite news|title=Prime-Time Ratings|date=1998-09-30|work=[[The Orange County Register]]|page=F02}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Will &amp; Grace'' quickly developed a loyal audience, with the show and McCormack receiving strong reviews. John Carman of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' commented that McCormack and costar [[Debra Messing]] (who played Will's best friend [[Grace Adler]]) worked "nicely" together.&lt;ref name="Carman1998"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article/article?f=/c/a/1998/09/21/DD39699.DTL|title=`Will &amp; Grace' Has Right Stuff To Make a Hit|last=Carman|first=John|date=1998-09-21|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|accessdate=2009-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kay McFadden of ''[[The Seattle Times]]'' also praised McCormack, Messing, and the supporting cast as "very funny".&lt;ref name="Mcfadden1998"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19980920&amp;slug=2773049 |title=TV Knows Best -- Seattle TV Critic Kay Mcfadden Tells You What To Waste Your Time On|last=Mcfadden|first=Kay|date=1998-09-20 |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |accessdate=2009-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this performance, he earned four [[Emmy Award]] nominations (2000, 2001, 2003, 2005), one of which resulted in a win (2001), for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor – Comedy Series|Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emmys.com/award_history_search?person=eric+mccormack&amp;program=start_year=1949&amp;end_year=2010&amp;network=All&amp;web_category=All&amp;winner=All |title=Search results |work=Primetime Emmy Award Database |accessdate=January 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he received five [[Golden Globe Award]] nominations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goldenglobes.org/browse/member/28828|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060521215434/http://www.goldenglobes.org/browse/member/28828|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2006-05-21|title=HFPA&amp;nbsp;— Awards Search|work=[[Golden Globes]]|accessdate=2009-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017, NBC closed a deal for a new, 10-episode season of [[Will &amp; Grace]], which is currently airing, during the 2017-18 season. The new show has been branded as a "reboot", or "revival", taking place 11 years after the original series' finale episode, and McCormack has reprised his role of the beloved Will Truman. In April 2017, the episode order was increased to 12 episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Reporter|first=DailyMail|title='Will &amp; Grace' Extended for Two More Episodes|publisher=DailyMail.|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-4385162/The-Grace-revival-gets-extended.html|date=| accessdate=2017-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2017, it was extended again, to 16 episodes, and a second 13-episode season was ordered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Wagmeister|first=Elizabeth|title='Will &amp; Grace' Revival Picked Up For Another Season|publisher=Variety|url=https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/will-and-grace-season-2-renewed-nbc-1202515243/|date=March 17, 2018| accessdate=2017-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2018, NBC ordered five more episodes for the revival's second season, bringing the total to 18 episodes, and also renewed the show for an 18-episode third season.

Following the end of ''Will &amp; Grace'', McCormack starred on the New York stage opposite [[Fran Drescher]], [[Judy Reyes]], [[Brooke Smith (actress)|Brooke Smith]], and [[Maura Tierney]], in [[Neil LaBute]]'s [[Off Broadway|off-Broadway]] play ''[[Some Girl(s)]]'' at the [[Lucille Lortel Theatre]].&lt;ref name="ben"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://theater2.nytimes.com/2006/06/09/theater/reviews/09girl.html?fta=y|title=In 'Some Girl(s),' a Pond Scum's Love Song|last=Brantley|first=Ben|date=2006-06-09|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2009-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; He plays a writer who is ready to settle down and marry, but decides to visit four ex-girlfriends first. For his performance, McCormack received critical reviews. ''New York Times'' contributor [[Ben Brantley]], in review of the production, wrote: "Playing a thoughtless, woman-despising heterosexual, Mr. McCormack isn't much different from when he was playing a thoughtful, woman-worshiping homosexual. As in ''Will &amp; Grace'', he italicizes every other line for maximum comic spin and punctuates his dialogue by earnestly furrowing his features".&lt;ref name="ben" /&gt; Brantley went on to say that McCormack's interpretation of the character is "certainly a more slickly sustained performance" than the one delivered by [[David Schwimmer]] in 2005.&lt;ref name="ben" /&gt; Melissa Rose Bernardo of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' commented that McCormack and Maura Tierney "have incredible chemistry".&lt;ref name="Bernardo2006"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1205718,00.html|title=Some Girl(s) (2006 - 2006)|last=Bernardo|first=Melissa Rose|date=2006-06-19|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=2009-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
