== Early life ==
Higa is of [[Japanese Americans|Japanese descent]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Considine|first1=Austin|title=For Asian-American Stars, Many Web Fans|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/31/fashion/for-asian-stars-many-web-fans.html|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=April 30, 2015|date=July 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; specifically from [[Okinawa Island|Okinawa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Higa|first1=Ryan|title=Tweet 21137901638|url=https://twitter.com/TheRealRyanHiga/status/21137901638|publisher=Twitter|accessdate=January 8, 2016|date=August 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was born in [[Hilo, Hawaii|Hilo]], [[Hawaii]] on June 6, 1990,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HIGAtv.com: About|url=http://www.higatv.com/about.php|publisher=HigaTv Productions|accessdate=December 29, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111226090853/http://www.higatv.com/about.php|archivedate=December 26, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has an older brother named Kyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=nigahiga|title=Life Hacks!

== YouTube career ==
Higa and Sean Fujiyoshi began posting YouTube videos of themselves [[lip sync]]ing to songs in mid-2006 while attending [[Waiakea High School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Hilo teens become a Web video sensation. | url=http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2008/Jul/27/il/hawaii807270330.html | publisher = The Honolulu Advertiser | date = July 27, 2008 | accessdate = August 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; They quickly expanded beyond songs, with a variety of other comedic pieces. Occasional guest appearances were made by Tim Enos, Ryan Villaruel, Kyle Chun, and Tarynn Nago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.starbulletin.com/2008/01/11/features/screentime.html |title=starbulletin.com &amp;#124; Features &amp;#124; /2008/01/11/ |publisher=Archives.starbulletin.com |date=January 11, 2008 |accessdate=July 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Christmas Eve of 2008, Higa and Fujiyoshi's two most popular videos, ''How To Be Gangster'' and ''How To Be Emo'', were removed due to copyright violations.&lt;ref name="copyrighted"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCTAqdDfL58&amp;feature=player_embedded|title=Copyrighted|last=Higa|first=Ryan|date=February 23, 2009|publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=December 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 21, 2009, the nigahiga account was temporarily suspended and was required to remove more copyrighted videos. Because of this, nigahiga's lip syncing videos were all removed (with the exception of ''You're Beautiful'', which was audio swapped),&lt;ref name="yourebeautiful"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhlvZuwl_pc|title=You're Beautiful|last=Higa|first=Ryan|date=June 27, 2008|publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=November 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with most of his other videos that included copyrighted music. Since then, Higa started composing the music himself. ''How to be Gangster'' and ''How to be Emo'' were put back on nigahiga's channel in late August 2009, only to be removed a few days later, along with ''How to be Ninja'' and ''How to be Nerd''. In Spring 2010, ''How to be Ninja'', ''How to be Gangster'' and ''How to be Emo'' were made public once more.&lt;ref name="uploads"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/nigahiga?blend=1&amp;ob=4#g/u|title=Uploads|last=Higa|first=Ryan|publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=October 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Higa moved to [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] to study [[nuclear medicine]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Interview: Ryan Higa on his YouTube celebrity status|url=http://www.scmp.com/magazines/48hrs/article/1736835/interview-ryan-higa-his-youtube-celebrity-status|publisher=South China Morning Post|accessdate=December 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[University of Nevada, Las Vegas]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westhawaiitoday.com/articles/2008/05/25/sports/local_sports/sports04.txt |title=from archives &gt; hi1,500 |publisher=West Hawaii Today |date=May 25, 2008 |accessdate=July 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; most of the nigahiga videos were solo efforts, usually featuring collaborations with other YouTube users. Since 2012, Higa has put together a production company, Ryan Higa Production Company (RHPC), which includes Sean Fujiyoshi, that works together to make content for the nigahiga channel.&lt;ref name=HigaTV/&gt; In 2016, Higa and other YouTubers and friends created the parody [[K-pop]] group [[Boys Generally Asian]].

== BgA ==
{{Main|Boys Generally Asian}}
In 2016 Ryan Higa made a K-pop band with [[David Choi]], Phillip Wang, [[Jun Sung Ahn]] and [[Justin Chon]]. It was called BgA, standing for Boys Generally Asian.
Their first song was called "Dong Saya Dae", which currently has over 13 million views on YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beZFLT0Ixag&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, BgA released their second song "Who's It Gonna Be".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gw6WIU5AF7k&amp;t=263s&lt;/ref&gt;

The nigahiga YouTube channel was created on July 20, 2006, by Higa, Fujiyoshi, Enos, and Nago (known collectively as "The Yabo Crew"). By December 21, 2010, it had reached 3 million subscribers, the first channel to do so.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hawaiisocialmedia.com/2010/12/nigahiga/ Ryan Higa Hits 3 Million YouTube Subscribers]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Higa,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tko|first=Tonya|title=NigaHiga Explains Name, Happy Slip, Kev Jumba &amp; TonyaTko -Amazing Asians vol 1.|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blAWuc-3_08#t=01m29s|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=February 27, 2012|date=November 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; his channel name is a combination of "Niga", which means "rant" in Japanese, and his last name, "Higa".&lt;ref name=rant&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lunn|first1=Emma|title=Jenna Marbles, Holasoygerman, Smosh and Nigahiga: The YouTube comedians earning millions|url=https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/the-youtube-comedians-earning-millions-153436484.html|publisher=Yahoo!

In 2012, Higa helped form the [[YOMYOMF|YOMYOMF Network]], which hosts the online video-making talent competition, ''[[Internet Icon]]'', of which he served alongside [[Christine Lakin]] and [[Traphik|Timothy DeLaGhetto]] as main judges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jeff Sneider|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118052020|title='Internet Icon' aims for virality|publisher=Variety|date=May 28, 2012|accessdate=December 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The resulting film, ''Ryan and Sean's Not So Excellent Adventure'', was directed by Richard Van Vleet and released on November 14, 2008.&lt;ref name="zap2it"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://movies.zap2it.com/movies/ryan-and-seans-not-so-excellent-adventure/190268|title=Ryan and Sean's Not So Excellent Adventure|publisher=zap2it.com|accessdate=November 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was shown in sold out theaters in [[Hawaii]] and [[California]].&lt;ref name="Herald"&gt;{{cite web|author=Associated Press |url=http://www.dailyherald.com/story/?id=249477 |title=YouTube was very good to this pair |publisher=Daily Herald |accessdate=September 19, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090704190532/http://www.dailyherald.com/story/?id=249477 |archivedate=July 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The DVD was released on July 14, 2009, in the United States.&lt;ref name="amazonDVD"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00208EXN0|title=Ryan and Sean's Not So Excellent Adventure (2008)|publisher=[[Amazon.com]]|accessdate=November 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
