'''Donald Andrew "Don" Novello''' (born January 1, 1943) is an American writer, [[film director]], [[television producer|producer]], actor, singer and [[comedian]]. He is best known for his work on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' from 1979–1980, and again from 1985–86, often as the character [[Father Guido Sarducci]]. He appeared as Sarducci in the video of [[Rodney Dangerfield]]'s "Rappin' Rodney", and on many subsequent television shows, including ''[[Married... with Children]]'', ''[[Blossom (TV series)|Blossom]]'', ''[[It's Garry Shandling's Show]]'', ''[[Unhappily Ever After]]'', ''[[Square Pegs]]'' and ''[[The Colbert Report]]''.

==Early life==
Novello was born in [[Ashtabula, Ohio|Ashtabula]], [[Ohio]], the son of Eleanor Eileen (née Finnerty), a nurse,&lt;ref name= gluvna&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.gluvna.net/Gobitdetail.asp?letter=N&amp;RecNo=1359| title= Obituaries: Eleanor E. Novello| website= gluvna.net| publisher= Gluvna Shimo Hromada| date= April 2008| access-date= May 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Augustine Joseph Novello, a physician.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Robert |last=Lebzelter |title=What You Need to Know about Your Home State |url=http://starbeacon.com/local/x343667259/What-you-need-to-know-about-your-home-state |work=[[Star Beacon]] |date=September 15, 2007 |accessdate=April 9, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/74/Don-Novello.html |title=Don Novello Biography (1943-) |website= filmreference.com |date=January 1, 1943 |accessdate=November 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is of Italian and Irish descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Y-YPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=e48DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2530,7942818&amp;dq=the-cast-includes-actor-don-novello&amp;hl=en |title=TV priest joins movie Mafia |work=Ellensburg Daily Record |date= |accessdate=November 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The family moved to [[Lorain, Ohio]], when Don was a young boy.&lt;ref name= gluvna /&gt; In 1961, he graduated from [[Lorain High School]]. He subsequently enrolled at the [[University of Dayton]] and graduated in 1964.&lt;ref name= "SNL UDayton"&gt;{{cite web | url= https://udayton.edu/blogs/libraries/2015-02-17-snl.php| title= Saturday Night Live!| website= UDayton.edu| publisher= University of Dayton| date= February 17, 2015| access-date= May 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965, he graduated with a Bachelor of Foreign Trade degree from the American Graduate School of International Management&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url= http://azmemory.azlibrary.gov/digital/collection/tgmama/id/18/| work= The Thunderbird| publisher= American Graduate School of International Management| date= Winter 1981| title= Confessions of a T-Bird| first1= Tim| last1= Parish| first2= Dan| last2= Wolf| via= Arizona Memory Project, ''azlibrary.gov''}}&lt;/ref&gt; (which became [[Thunderbird School of Global Management]] and then part of [[Arizona State University]]).

==Career==
In the late 1960s, Novello worked as an advertising copywriter for [[Leo Burnett]] in [[Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ySMXLky50NkC&amp;pg=PT184&amp;lpg=PT184&amp;dq=%22Don+Novello%22+%22Leo+Burnett%22#PPT185,M1 |title=Live from New York: an uncensored ... - Google Books |publisher=|date= |accessdate=November 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/1997/09/02/DD67491.DTL&amp;hw=comedian&amp;sn=095&amp;sc=330 |title=Don Novello Tries To Save His Sheep / One-shot musical detailed in TV special |publisher=Sfgate.com |date=September 2, 1997 |accessdate=November 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Novello created the Father Guido Sarducci character in 1973 after finding a monsignor's outfit for $7.50 at a St. Vincent de Paul thrift shop. Adding sunglasses, a broom mustache, cigarette and a thick Italian accent, Sarducci became popular in a San Francisco nightclub. Sarducci appeared on San Francisco Channel 20's ''Chicken Little Comedy Show'', and comic David Steinberg was watching. Steinberg hired Novello as a writer for a TV show that never aired, but he also introduced Novello to Tommy and Dick Smothers, and they hired Novello, too. Novello performed on ''[[The Smothers Brothers Show]]'' in 1975, appearing as Sarducci.

{{anchor &lt;!-- This anchor is linked from the Hatnote of the Dab page [[Tóth]] --&gt;|Lazlo}}In the 1970s, Novello started to write letters to famous people under the pen name of '''Lazlo Toth''' (after [[Laszlo Toth]], a deranged man who vandalized [[Michelangelo]]'s [[Pietà (Michelangelo)|Pietà]] in Rome). The letters, written to suggest a serious but misinformed and obtuse correspondent, were designed to [[satire|tweak the noses]] of politicians and corporations. Many of them received serious responses; Novello sometimes continued the charade correspondence at length, with humorous results. The letters and responses were published in the books ''The Lazlo Letters'',&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|1-56305-285-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Citizen Lazlo!'',&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|1-56305-182-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''From Bush to Bush: The Lazlo Toth Letters''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|0-7432-5108-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Lazlo Letters'', Novello's first book of stilted letters to celebrities, caught the attention of Lorne Michaels, producer of ''Saturday Night Live''. Novello was hired as a writer for the show's [[Saturday Night Live (season 3)|third season]] in 1977-1978 where he remained through the [[Saturday Night Live (season 5)|fifth season]], and returned as a writer in the [[Saturday Night Live (season 11)|eleventh season]]. He also appeared numerous times on the show in the Father Guido Sarducci character.

In 1980, under the name of Father Guido Sarducci, he sang lead vocals on the Warner Bros. Records release, "I Won't Be Twisting This Christmas"/"Parco MacArthur" (WBS49627). Novello co-wrote the first tune with M. Davich, and the second tune is an Italian language cover of "[[MacArthur Park (song)|MacArthur Park]]", the [[Jimmy Webb]] song, in an arrangement similar to that recorded by [[Richard Harris]].

Novello made newspapers around the world when he visited the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] in 1981 wearing the Father Guido Sarducci costume and, while taking photographs for a magazine article in an area where photography was prohibited, was arrested by the [[Swiss Guard]]s along with his photographer (Paul Solomon), and eventually charged with "impersonating a priest". The charges were later dropped, and Solomon managed to protect the film from confiscation.

In his stage show in Las Vegas and Reno with the Smothers Brothers, Father Guido Sarducci rolled a wheelchair with a dummy in the robes of a cardinal. In the act, Sarducci explained he was the assistant of 108-year-old "Cardinal Dario Fungi."

For a brief period in 1982, Novello was a producer on ''[[Second City Television|SCTV]]'', a Toronto-based comedy show starring [[Martin Short]], [[Joe Flaherty]], [[John Candy]], [[Eugene Levy]], [[Dave Thomas (actor)|Dave Thomas]], [[Rick Moranis]], [[Andrea Martin]] and [[Catherine O'Hara]]. He was installed by NBC as one of a series of producers for the show's fourth season, and produced a total of 9 episodes. In 1984 Novello wrote ''The Blade'', a high school yearbook parody in which the students are represented by sheep. Novello co-wrote the unfilmed script for [http://subcin.com/noblerot.html ''Noble Rot''], with [[John Belushi]]. He also narrated [[Faerie Tale Theatre]]'s third-season episode ''Pinocchio'' with [[Paul Reubens]] as the titular puppet. Also in 1984, Novello appeared in the music video for the [[Jefferson Starship]] song "No Way Out".

In 1989, Novello co-starred in the anthology film ''[[New York Stories]]'' in the [[Francis Ford Coppola]]-directed segment, ''Life Without Zoe''. In his 2 1/2 star review of the movie, [[Roger Ebert]] cited Novello for giving "the most engaging performance in the movie."

In 1990, Novello portrayed "Dominic Abbandando" in the film ''[[The Godfather Part III]]''. Abbandando appears with speaking lines in the first scene as public relations and media coordinator for Don Michael Corleone. Most notable is when he slaps down a news reporter with the challenge: "You think you know better than the Pope?" Novello appears in many other scenes as well, shadowing George Hamilton, and in the climactic scene on the steps of the Palermo opera house, Teatro Massimo.

In 2001, he lent his voice to the character [[Atlantis: The Lost Empire#Voice cast|Vincenzo "Vinny" Santorini]] in the [[Disney]] animated film ''[[Atlantis: The Lost Empire]]'', and subsequently in the direct-to-video sequel ''[[Atlantis: Milo's Return]]''. In 2003, he filed papers to enter the [[2003 California recall]] election, but failed to collect enough valid signatures to qualify for the ballot.

In 2005, after the death of [[Pope John Paul II]], Novello, as Father Guido Sarducci, reprised his former ''SNL'' role as "Special Vatican Reporter" for [[Air America Radio]] host (and fellow ''Saturday Night Live'' alumnus) [[Al Franken]]. He continued this role until the election of [[Pope Benedict XVI]]. In 2006, he portrayed the role of [[Galileo]] on the podcast "[[The Radio Adventures of Dr. Floyd]]".

He portrayed [[Pope Pius XII]] in the 2009 short film ''[[All in the Bunker]]''.

On June 23, 2010, he appeared on ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' as Father Guido Sarducci.

On October 30, 2010, he gave the benediction at the [[Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear]] hosted by [[Jon Stewart]] and [[Stephen Colbert]].&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|IGCP5CqHwxk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American recording artist Guthrie Thomas credited Don Novello as "the best performer in the room" when Novello appeared as Father Guido Sarducci on one of Thomas' albums in a recording studio full of famous performers.

==Personal life==
Novello resides in [[San Anselmo, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Paul|last=Liberatore |url=http://www.marinij.com/lifestyles/ci_4751289 |title=Paul Liberatore: Holiday songs? Bah humbug! - Marin Independent Journal |publisher=Marinij.com |date=November 30, 2006 |accessdate=November 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has one brother, Joseph "Joe" Novello. His former sister-in-law [[Antonia Novello|Dr. Antonia Novello M.D.]] was [[Surgeon General of the United States]] from 1990 to 1993.   His niece is film producer, Holly Wiersma (Wonderland, Billionaire Boys Club).
