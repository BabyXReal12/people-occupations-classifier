'''Elmer Goodfellow "El" Brendel''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɛ|l|_|b|r|ɛ|n|ˈ|d|ɛ|l}} (March 25, 1890 &amp;ndash; April 9, 1964) was an American [[vaudeville]] comedian turned movie star, best remembered for his dialect routine as a Swedish immigrant.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=AebLY8OZckcC&amp;pg=PA27&amp;dq=Yumpin%27+Yimminy:+representing+the+Scandinavian+immigrant&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=n89rU5tfjJbIBOyQgcAI&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Screen culture: history &amp; textuality'' by John Fullerton, (Eastleigh, England: John Libbey, 2004) pp. 27-28.]&lt;/ref&gt; His biggest role was as "Single-0" in the sci-fi musical ''[[Just Imagine]]'' (1930), produced by [[Fox Film Corporation]]. His screen name was pronounced "El Bren-DEL".&lt;ref name="Slide 1998"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=UkkfEiXTb5gC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;dq=Ethnic+characterizations+were+once+a+staple+of+Hollywood+film+production&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=79NrU-GEDJKHyATZloCgCA&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Eccentrics of comedy'' by Anthony Slide, (Lanham, MD: The Scarecrow Press, 1998) pp. 13-24.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
He was born on March 25, 1890 in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] to an Irish mother and German immigrant father.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; Brendel, unlike his stage and film character, was not Swedish. He spoke standard American English without a trace of any other accent. He attended the [[University of Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; 

He entered [[vaudeville]] in 1913 as a German dialect comedian and married his vaudeville partner. Because of the anti-German sentiment brought about by the sinking of the [[Lusitania]], Brendel developed a new character, one he would portray on stage and in films for the rest of his career: a good-natured, simple Swede, often called "Oley," "Ole," or "Ollie." During the 1910s and early 1920s, he appeared with his wife, vaudeville star Flo Bert, doing a married-couple routine. It was during this period that he coined his trademark lines, "Yee vizz!" and "Yumpin' yiminy!".&lt;ref name="Slide 1998"/&gt; He made his first stage appearance in 1921. He appeared in [[Cinderella on Broadway]], [[Spice of 1922]], [[Passing Show]], and [[New York Whirl]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; 

==Career==
[[Image:El Brendel-Yola d'Avril in Hot for Paris.jpg|thumb|210px|El Brendel and [[Yola d'Avril]] in ''[[Hot for Paris]]'' (1929)]]
In 1926, he signed a contract with [[Famous Players Film Company]] and appeared in eight films there over the next two years, most memorably as the comic relief in ''[[Wings (1927 film)|Wings]]'' (1927) with [[Clara Bow]] and [[Charles Rogers (actor)|Buddy Rogers]], a film which won the first [[Academy Award]] for Outstanding Production (an award that is comparable to today's [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] Oscar.)  Brendel played the character Herman Schwimpf, a German-American whose patriotism is at first questioned when he volunteers for service in the [[U.S. Air Force]].

Brendel left [[Paramount Pictures]] in 1927 to return to the vaudeville stage before being coaxed back to [[Hollywood]] in 1929, signing a contract with [[Fox Film Corporation]].

Brendel's star immediately rose at the studio, largely in part due to the advent of sound. His "simple Swede" character now had a voice, and his [[malaprop]]-ridden dialogue gave his character new appeal. He was featured in the boisterous "Quirt and Flagg" military comedies with [[Edmund Lowe]] and [[Victor McLaglen]]. After finishing production of ''[[Sunny Side Up (film)|Sunny Side Up]]'' with [[Janet Gaynor]], Brendel was the star comedian in ''[[New Movietone Follies of 1930]]'', ''[[The Big Trail]]'' with John Wayne, and the [[Gershwin]] musical ''[[Delicious (1931 film)|Delicious]]'' with Gaynor, which introduced the song "New York Rhapsody" and featured Brendel's rendition of "Blah Blah Blah".&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|87Av6maPocI|"Delicious"}} Retrieved: October 5, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930 Brendel starred in ''[[Just Imagine]]'', a science fiction musical directed by [[David Butler (director)|David Butler]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/download/TheJazzAge/AcTheRomanceOfElmerStremingway.mp3 "Just Imagine"] ''archive.org'' Retrieved: October 5, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1931 Fox starred him in the dual roles of Mr. Lemon and Silent McGee in the comedy ''[[Mr. Lemon of Orange]].''  While ''Mr. Lemon of Orange'' was publicized by Fox as Brendel's first starring role, that distinction is more accurately given to ''Just Imagine'', which was released five months earlier. Brendel was the most popular comedian in America at the time, according to author Richard Barrios.&lt;ref name="Slide 1998"/&gt;

Despite the positive public reception of ''Just Imagine'' and ''Mr. Lemon of Orange,'' it was judged that Brendel could not carry an expensive film. He continued to play leads in B-pictures, but served in more prestigious fare mainly in supporting roles, mostly with his trademark Swedish accent. In 1933, he left Fox and had a brief tenure at [[Warner Bros. Studios]] making two-reelers, and for the next few years, was a freelance actor. His former director [[David Butler (director)|David Butler]] cast him in two major features, ''[[Little Miss Broadway]]'' with [[Shirley Temple]], and ''[[If I Had My Way]]'' co-starring [[Bing Crosby]] and [[Gloria Jean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|6D_cS8Y43oE|"If I Had My Way"}} Retrieved: December 3, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936, El Brendel made his debut at [[Columbia Pictures]] in a pair of two-reel comedies; producer [[Jules White]] liked Brendel's act and hired him for a series in 1941. Brendel was a popular attraction in short subjects (Columbia billed him as "America's Swede-Heart!") and he was often paired with other well-known comedians, including [[Shemp Howard]], [[Harry Langdon]], Tom Kennedy, and [[Monty Collins]]. Brendel also starred in feature films for the independent [[Producers Releasing Corporation|PRC]] studio. When his PRC and Columbia work ran out in 1945, Brendel went back to vaudeville, returning to the screen only occasionally.&lt;ref name="Slide 1998"/&gt; One of his last films was ''[[The Beautiful Blonde from Bashful Bend]]'' (1949), starring [[Betty Grable]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=XFnfnKg6BcAC&amp;pg=PA140&amp;dq=El+Brendel&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MRiQUdWjLoPWygHYpYCYCQ&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Vaudeville, old and new: an encyclopedia of variety performers in America'' by Frank Cullen, Florence Hackman and Donald McNeilly, (New York: Routledge, 2007) p. 140.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950 El Brendel recorded four numbers for [[Imperial Records]]: ''Frankie And Johnny'', ''Hulda'', ''Pinch Of Snoose'' and ''Yumpin' Yiminy'' (a loose adaptation of the 1918 song ''Holy Yumpin Yimini'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globaldogproductions.info/i/imperial-8000-series.html El Brendel singles 8085-8086] ''globaldogproductions.info''.

Morris, 1918).]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1950s, he shared a brief revival with his wife, Flo Bert, on television variety shows, including ''[[You Asked For It]]'' with [[Art Baker (actor)|Art Baker]]. He also appeared in a few television series such as ''[[Cowboy G-Men]]'', ''[[My Little Margie]]'', and ''[[Perry Mason]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/search.php?query=El%20Brendel%20Classic%20TV El Brendel on TV] ''archive.org''. Retrieved: November 24, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; His last film was ''Laffing Time'' (1959), a featherweight, sitcom-styled comedy. Producer Edward Finney took the leading role, with [[Gloria Jean]] as the feminine lead, and Mr. and Mrs. Brendel as neighbors. Brendel also recorded narration for a proposed children's-television project; some of this footage appears in Finney's feature film ''Tobo the Happy Clown''.&lt;ref name="Slide 1998"/&gt;

==Death==
El Brendel died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] at the [[Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center|Hollywood Presbyterian Hospital]] in [[Hollywood, California]] on April 9, 1964.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news |agency=[[United Press International]] |title=El Brendel, 73, Dies on Coast |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/04/10/el-brendel-73-dies-on-coast.html?mtrref=query.nytimes.com&amp;_r=0 |quote= |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=April 10, 1964 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is buried at the [[Hollywood Forever Cemetery]]. &lt;ref name="Brendel 1890-1964"&gt;[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/7893365 El Brendel] ''findagrave.com''.
