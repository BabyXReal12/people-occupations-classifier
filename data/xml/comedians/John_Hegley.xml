==Early life==
He was born in the [[Newington Green]] area of [[Islington]], London, England, into a Roman Catholic household.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/apr/27/poetry.comment "Stanza and deliver"], ''The Observer'', 27 April 2003&lt;/ref&gt; He was brought up in [[Luton]] and later [[Bristol]], where he attended Rodway School.  After school he worked as a bus conductor and civil servant before attending the [[University of Bradford]], where he gained a BSc in European Literature and the History of Ideas and Sociology. Hegley has French ancestry (his father's name was René) and claims he is descended from the composer [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fife.gov.uk/yourtown/index.cfm?fuseaction=news.display&amp;town=78E4E4F9-DA4D-6CAD-5617FBFC91B78425&amp;objectid=33FDD615-9E65-A54E-C470A643C49C03BE "People's Poet Laureate Plays Adam Smith Theatre"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608015851/http://www.fife.gov.uk/yourtown/index.cfm?fuseaction=news.display&amp;town=78E4E4F9-DA4D-6CAD-5617FBFC91B78425&amp;objectid=33FDD615-9E65-A54E-C470A643C49C03BE |date= 8 June 2011 }}, fifedirect.org.uk, 29 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt; His paternal grandmother was a dancer with the [[Folies Bergère]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/jun/20/john-hegley-family-values "My family values: John Hegley, poet"], ''The Guardian'', 20 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Hegley began his performing career at London's [[Comedy Store, London|Comedy Store]] in 1980, and toured as one half of The Brown Paper Bag Brothers with Otiz Cannelloni.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=oFw_eWqvHV8C&amp;pg=PT384&amp;lpg=PT384&amp;dq=Brown+Paper+Bag+Brothers+with+Otiz+Cannelloni&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Z6nEb4hfoz&amp;sig=2l5RXsr3TcoDXBNgmdfkc5MgMyI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwA2oVChMIifn20-H7xwIVyyPbCh2zZwTM#v=onepage&amp;q=Brown%20Paper%20Bag%20Brothers%20with%20Otiz%20Cannelloni&amp;f=false Davies, Alan. ''My Favourite People &amp; Me: 1978-1988''], Michael Joseph Ltd (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; He received national exposure when he appeared with his backing band the Popticians on ''[[Carrott's Lib]]'' in 1983, and recorded two sessions for [[John Peel]] in 1983 and 1984.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/johnpeel/artists/t/thepopticians/ BBC – Radio 1 – Keeping it Peel – The Popticians]&lt;/ref&gt; Hegley published his first poetry collection, ''Visions of the Bone Idol (Poems about Dogs and Glasses)'', pieces from which were later incorporated into ''Glad to Wear Glasses'', in 1984. Hegley has written a number of collections of poetry, ranging from the surreal through the humorous to the personal and emotional.  There are a number of recurring themes in his poems, notably glasses, dogs and reminiscences of his childhood in Luton.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.contemporarywriters.com/authors/?p=auth02D4J450112627326 John Hegley at contemporarywriters.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070410033753/http://www.contemporarywriters.com/authors/?p=auth02D4J450112627326 |date=10 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was presenter of the [[Border Television]] series ''Word of Mouth'' – in which numerous contemporary poets performed their work – in 1990, and the [[BBC radio]] series ''Hearing with Hegley'' from 1996 to 1999.  His other television appearances include ''[[Wogan]]'' and ''[[Never Mind the Buzzcocks]]''. In 1998, Hegley's poem "Malcolm" came second in a [[BBC]] survey to find Britain's most popular comic poem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/190291.stm |title=Top poetry is complete nonsense |publisher=BBC |date=10 October 1998 |accessdate=6 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999 he starred in a [[Simon Callow]]-directed revival of the musical ''[[The Pajama Game]]'' in London's West End.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/464680.stm "Pajama Game pillowtalk"], ''BBC News'', 4 October 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1999 together with [[Simon Munnery]] he wrote and performed in a comedy series for BBC Radio 4 called ''[[The Adventures of John and Tony]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://epguides.com/AdventuresofJohnandTony/ EPGuides.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hegley frequently performs live and is a regular at the [[Edinburgh Festival]].  His stage act includes elements of poetry, music (he plays the [[mandolin]] and is often accompanied by a double bassist), comedy and [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town Football Club]]. He also likes to utilise audience participation in his shows, for example by having a dog drawing competition during the interval, or by asking his audience to try writing poetry themselves.

The [[University of Bedfordshire|University of Luton]] awarded him an [[honorary degree|honorary]] [[Doctor of Laws|LL.D.]] in 2000, and he has also led creative writing courses at the university.&lt;ref&gt;Rampton, J.

Hegley launched "[[Warning: May Contain Nuts]]", a project using comedy to increase awareness of mental illness.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web |title=Mackenzie Taylor talks about mental health problems |date=25 May 2010 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/berkshire/hi/people_and_places/arts_and_culture/newsid_8701000/8701610.stm |work=BBC |author=Jenny Minard    |accessdate=10 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He performed these shows in 2010 with other performers, including comic [[Mackenzie Taylor]], talking about mental illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Warning: May Contain Nuts, South Street Arts Centre, Reading |work=The Independent |date=20 May 2010 |author=Toby Green |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/comedy/reviews/warning-may-contain-nuts-south-street-arts-centre-reading-1977593.html |accessdate=20 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
