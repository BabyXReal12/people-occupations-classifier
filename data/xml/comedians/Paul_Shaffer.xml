==Early years==
Shaffer was born and raised in [[Fort William, Ontario|Fort William]] (now part of [[Thunder Bay]]), [[Ontario]], Canada, the son of Shirley and Bernard Shaffer, a lawyer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/73/Paul-Shaffer.html |title=Paul Shaffer Biography (1949–) |website=Filmreference.com |accessdate=November 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shaffer was raised in a [[Jew]]ish family. As a child, Shaffer took piano lessons, and in his teenage years played the organ in a band called Fabulous Fugitives with his schoolmates in Thunder Bay. Later he performed with the "Flash Landing Band" at different venues around Edmonton and the interior of B.C. Educated at the [[University of Toronto]], he began playing with [[jazz]] guitarist [[Tisziji Muñoz]], performing in bands around the bars there, where he found an interest in musicals, and completed his studies, with a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A. degree]] in sociology in 1971.&lt;ref name="King"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/paul-shaffer-emc/ |title=Shaffer, Paul|last=King|first=Betty Nygaard |work=Encyclopedia of Music in Canada|publisher=The Canadian Encyclopedia|accessdate=2009-01-02}}; Michael Posner, "Paul Talk", ''Toronto Globe and Mail'', October 17, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Shaffer appears briefly, playing an organ at an outdoor wedding, in ''[[North of Superior]]'' (1971) an early [[IMAX]] documentary shot in [[northern Ontario]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/showthread.php?t=316904|title=I talked to Paul Shaffer today! - Straight Dope Message Board|website=Boards.straightdope.com|accessdate=August 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musical career==
Shaffer began his music career in 1972 when [[Stephen Schwartz (composer)|Stephen Schwartz]] invited him to be the musical director for the Toronto production of ''[[Godspell]]'',&lt;ref name=cm /&gt; starring [[Victor Garber]], [[Gilda Radner]], [[Martin Short]], [[Eugene Levy]], [[Dave Thomas (actor)|Dave Thomas]] and [[Andrea Martin]]. He went on to play piano for the Schwartz [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] show ''[[The Magic Show]]'' in 1974, then became a member of the house band on [[NBC]]'s popular ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (''SNL'') television program from 1975 to 1980 (except for a brief departure in 1977). Though Shaffer was at the piano and appeared to be directing the band's actions, [[Howard Shore]] was credited as ''SNL'''s musical director, eventually turning the actual conducting of the band to sax player [[Howard Johnson (jazz musician)|Howard Johnson]]. Shaffer also regularly appeared in the show's sketches, notably as the pianist for [[Bill Murray]]'s Nick the Lounge Singer character, and as [[Don Kirshner]]. He also appeared as a keyboardist on the 1978 album, ''[[Desire Wire]]'', recorded by pop/rock star, musician and backing vocalist [[Cindy Bullens]].

Shaffer occasionally teamed up with the [[Not Ready for Prime-Time Players]] off the show as well, including work on Gilda Radner's highly successful Broadway show and as the musical director for [[John Belushi]] and [[Dan Aykroyd]] whenever they recorded or performed as [[The Blues Brothers]]. Shaffer was to appear in the duo's 1980 film, but, as he revealed in October 2009 on ''[[CBS Sunday Morning]]'', Belushi dropped him from the project. In a memo to fellow ''SNL'' colleagues, Belushi said that he was unhappy that Shaffer was spending so much time on a studio record for Radner. Belushi said that he had tried to talk Shaffer out of working on the album in the first place in order to avoid sharing Shaffer's talents with another ''SNL''-related project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/10/04/sunday/main5362008.shtml|title=Paul Shaffer's Showbiz Journey}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shaffer later reported that he was in (unrequited) love with [[Gilda Radner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Michael|last=Posner|title=Paul Talk|newspaper=The Globe and Mail|date=October 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He would go on to appear in 1998's ''[[Blues Brothers 2000]]''.

Beginning in 1982, Shaffer served as musical director for [[David Letterman]]'s late night talk shows: as leader of "The World's Most Dangerous Band" for ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'' (1982–1993) on NBC, for which he also composed the theme song, and as leader of the [[CBS Orchestra]] for the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' (1993–2015) on [[CBS]]. Letterman consistently maintained that the show's switch to CBS was because NBC "fired Paul for stealing pens" or some other facetious reason. Shaffer guest-hosted the show twice when Letterman was unavailable, including during Letterman's January 2000 medical leave for quintuple [[heart bypass surgery]], and during the birth of Letterman's son Harry in November 2003.

In 1984, Shaffer played keyboards for [[The Honeydrippers]], a group formed in 1981 by former [[Led Zeppelin]] frontman [[Robert Plant]], on their only studio album, ''[[The Honeydrippers: Volume One]]''. The album included the hit single "[[Sea of Love (song)|Sea of Love]]" which reached No. 1 on ''Billboard'''s adult contemporary chart in 1984 and No. 3 on its Hot 100 chart in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{Allmusic|class=album|id=mw0000650260|label=The Honeydrippers, Vol. 1|tab=credits}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shaffer has served as musical director and producer for the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] induction ceremony since its inception in 1986 and filled the same role for the [[1996 Olympic Games]] closing ceremonies from Atlanta, Georgia. Shaffer also served as musical director for ''[[Fats Domino]] and Friends'', a Cinemax special that included [[Ray Charles]], [[Jerry Lee Lewis]] and [[Ron Wood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theworldsmostdangerousband.com/bio_paul.html|title=Paul Shaffer and the World's Most Dangerous Band-Biography|website=Theworldsmostdangerousband.com|access-date=2018-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He released two solo albums, 1989's [[Grammy]]-nominated ''Coast to Coast'', and 1993's ''[[The World's Most Dangerous Party]]'', produced by rock musician [[Todd Rundgren]]. Shaffer has also recorded with a wide range of artists, including [[Donald Fagen]], [[Ronnie Wood]], [[Grand Funk Railroad]], [[Diana Ross]], [[B.B. King]], [[Asleep at the Wheel]], [[Cyndi Lauper]], [[Carl Perkins]], [[Yoko Ono]], [[Blues Traveler]], [[Jeff Healey]], [[Cher]], [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]], [[Luba (singer)|Luba]], [[Robert Burns]], [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]], [[Bootsy Collins]], [[Nina Hagen]], [[Robert Plant]], [[Peter Criss]], [[Scandal (American band)|Scandal]], [[Brian Wilson]], ''Late Show'' regular [[Warren Zevon]], jazz trumpeter [[Lew Soloff]], jazz saxophonist [[Lou Marini]] and bluegrass legend [[Earl Scruggs]]. In 1982, he co-wrote "[[It's Raining Men]]," with [[Paul Jabara]]. It was No. 1 on the US Billboard Hot Dance Club Play charts, a No. 2 hit in the UK for [[The Weather Girls]] in 1984 and a UK No. 1 remake for [[Geri Halliwell]] in 2001. Shaffer and The World's Most Dangerous Band performed the [[Chuck Berry]] song "Roll over Beethoven" for the 1992 film [[Beethoven (film)|''Beethoven'']].

In 2017, Shaffer reunited with his band, resuming its previous name, and recorded the self-titled album ''Paul Shaffer &amp; the World's Most Dangerous Band''. Shaffer and the band released their album in March and then went on tour as well as making appearances on both ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live]]'' and ''[[The Late Show with Stephen Colbert]]'', for which Shaffer and the band returned to the [[Ed Sullivan Theater]] for the first time since Letterman's finale two years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/08/arts/music/paul-shaffer-david-letterman-bill-murray-album.html?nytmobile=0|title=Paul Shaffer Shakes Off His Post-''Letterman'' Blues|work=The New York Times|first=Dave|last=Itzkoff}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.rhino.com/press-release/paul-shaffer-worlds-most-dangerous-band-new-album-available-march-17|title=Paul Shaffer &amp; The World's Most Dangerous Band New Album Available March 17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/news/watch-paul-shaffers-uproarious-return-to-late-night-w488761|title=Watch Paul Shaffer's Uproarious Return to 'Late Night'|first=Jon|last=Blistein|date=June 20, 2017|website=Rollingstone.com|accessdate=August 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stereogum.com/1930246/paul-shaffer-perform-with-jenny-lewis-and-shaggy-on-kimmel/video/|title=Watch Paul Shaffer Perform With Jenny Lewis And Shaggy On Kimmel|date=March 16, 2017|website=Stereogum.com|accessdate=August 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shaffer wrote and performs the theme song and bridging music on Letterman's current [[Netflix]] series ''[[My Next Guest Needs No Introduction with David Letterman]]'' which premiered in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stuever|first1=Hank|title=Review: Letterman sits down with Obama, but both men seem rusty and off their game|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/tv/letterman-sits-down-with-obama-but-both-men-seem-rusty-and-off-their-game/2018/01/11/2b6dc8c0-f70c-11e7-a9e3-ab18ce41436a_story.html|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=January 13, 2018|date=January 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After it was announced publicly that Netflix had given the series an order, Shaffer received a phone call from Letterman asking him to work on the show. Soon after, Shaffer began to receive cuts of episodes from the first season and he started to put music in afterwards where the director thought it was needed. In developing the sound of the show's music, Shaffer initially looked to Letterman for guidance. Finding none, he remembered he and Letterman's shared love for the sort of music produced at the [[Muscle Shoals Sound Studio]] in [[Sheffield, Alabama]], describing it as "the honesty you hear, the southern soul feeling". The score initially included drums but the show's producers and director thought that the music should "feel like it's Dave's old friend Paul playing", so it was ultimately stripped down to solely include piano and organ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Leight|first1=Elias|title=Paul Shaffer on Writing Letterman's Netflix Theme Song &amp; the Value of Humor in Pop|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/8097779/paul-shaffer-letterman-netflix-interview|website=Billboard.com|accessdate=February 9, 2018|date=February 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other activities==
Shaffer has appeared in a number of motion pictures over the years, including a small role (Artie Fufkin of Polymer Records) in [[Rob Reiner]]'s ''[[This Is Spinal Tap]],'' ''[[Blues Brothers 2000]]'', a scene with [[Miles Davis]] in the [[Bill Murray]] film ''[[Scrooged]]'', and as a passenger in [[John Travolta]]'s [[taxicab]] in ''[[Look Who's Talking Too]]''. In addition, Shaffer lent his voice to [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney's]] animated feature and television series ''[[Hercules (1997 film)|Hercules]],'' as the character [[Hermes]].&lt;ref name="IMDbHerc"&gt;{{cite web |title=Hercules (1997) |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119282/reference |website=IMDb.com|accessdate=20 June 2018 |language=en |format=HTML}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, Shaffer left ''SNL'' for a few months to co-star with [[Greg Evigan]] in ''[[A Year at the Top]]'', a short-lived [[CBS]] sitcom in which Shaffer and Evigan play two musicians from [[Idaho]] who relocate to Hollywood where they are regularly tempted by a famous promoter (who is actually the devil's son), played by [[Gabriel Dell]], to sell their souls in exchange for a year of stardom. Though the series only lasted a few episodes, a soundtrack album was released.

Following the series' cancellation, Shaffer returned to ''SNL''. In the fall of 1979, Shaffer became the first person to say "fuck" on ''SNL''.&lt;ref&gt;Shales, Tom; Miller, James Andrew (2002). ''Live From New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live''. United States: Hachette Book Group USA. {{ISBN|0-316-73565-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; That year, ''SNL'' parodied ''[[The Troggs Tapes]]'' with a medieval musical sketch featuring Shaffer, Bill Murray, Harry Shearer, and a "special guest appearance" by John Belushi (who had left the show the previous spring). In the middle of a long tirade which featured repeated use of the word "flogging," Shaffer inadvertently uttered the forbidden word. It not only escaped the censors in the live broadcast and the West Coast taped airing, but also reappeared in the summer rerun, and even in the syndicated versions of the show for several years. Shaffer, at Letterman's urging, related the story on the very first episode of ''Late Night''.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

In 1977, Shaffer played on the Mark &amp; Clark Band's hit record ''[[Worn Down Piano]]''.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Shaffer recorded the famous synthesizer solo in the 1982 hit "[[Goodbye to You (Scandal song)|Goodbye to You]]" by the band [[Scandal (American band)|Scandal]]. He used his [[Oberheim OB-Xa]] to emulate a 1960s organ sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Mitchell|last=Sigman|title=Scandal's "Goodbye to You" Solo|newspaper=Keyboard Magazine|page=44|date=March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He hosted ''[[Happy New Year, America]]'' in 1994 on CBS Network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Happy New Year America 1994|publisher=The Turner Classic Movies|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/466542/HAPPY-NEW-YEAR-AMERICA|accessdate=July 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, he appeared in [[Blues Traveler]]'s video for the song "[[Hook (song)|Hook]]".{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Shaffer also appeared, with very small, comedic cameos, in the sci-fi fantasy movie ''[[Star Trek: First Contact]]'' in 1996 and, in 1992, in the sport comedy movie with [[James Woods]], ''[[Diggstown]]''. Around 1998 he was on ''[[Hollywood Squares]]''.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

In 2001, Shaffer hosted the [[VH1]] game show ''Cover Wars'' with DJ/model Sky Nellor. The show featured [[cover band]]s competing for the ultimate series win. Each week, Shaffer would sign off with, "Just because you're in a cover band, it doesn't mean you're not a star." The show lasted 13 episodes and featured celebrity judges including [[Kevin Bacon]], [[Nile Rodgers]], [[Cyndi Lauper]] and [[Ace Frehley]].

Shaffer served as musical director for 2001's [[The Concert for New York City]], and accompanied [[Adam Sandler]]'s [[Opera Man]] sketch and the [[Backstreet Boys]]' "[[Quit Playing Games (with My Heart)]]".

In 2002, a street which surrounds the [[Thunder Bay Community Auditorium]] in his hometown was renamed Paul Shaffer Drive. Shaffer has also received two honorary doctorates, including one from [[Lakehead University]].

Since 2002, he has been the national spokesperson for Epilepsy Canada. On September 29, 2005, Shaffer made a major contribution to [[Lakehead University]] to dedicate the fifth floor ATAC boardroom to his father Bernard Shaffer, inaugural member of the Board of Governors. In June 2006, he received a star on [[Canada's Walk of Fame]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

In 2005, along with [[Steven Van Zandt]], he organized a benefit for [[Mike Smith (Dave Clark Five)|Mike Smith]] (formerly of [[The Dave Clark Five]]), who had suffered a paralysing fall at his home in Spain. Shaffer cites Mike Smith as an early influence.

Shaffer hosts the 60-second radio vignettes called "Paul Shaffer's Day in Rock".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.paulshaffersdayinrock.com/ |title=Welcome to the show |year=2012 |website=Paulshaffersdayinrock.com |accessdate=September 9, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These audio shorts were first produced for Envision Radio Networks and debuted in 2007 on New York station [[WAXQ-FM]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WHTZ asks schools to help in CD drive |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-144638120.html |author=Raymond A.

In 2008, Shaffer made a cameo appearance at the beginning of the ''[[Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent]]'' season 7 episode "[[Vanishing Act (Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent episode)|Vanishing Act]]".

Shaffer's memoir, ''We'll Be Here for the Rest of Our Lives: A Swingin' Show-biz Saga'' (co-authored by [[David Ritz]]) was published on October 6, 2009. The same day, he made an appearance as a guest on ''The Late Show''.

Shaffer never returned the call from Jerry Seinfeld that offered him the role of [[George Costanza]] in ''[[Seinfeld]]''. Shaffer never auditioned for the role, Seinfeld simply called to offer him the job.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?id=20100302tvguide01|title=Breaking News - TV Guide Network's "25 Biggest TV Blunders" Special Delivers 3.3 Million Viewers and Becomes #1 Rated Special Among Women 25-54|website=Thefutoncritic.com|accessdate=August 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Shaffer appeared with [[Bachman &amp; Turner]] at the [[Roseland Ballroom]] in New York. His appearance was included on the live album recorded on that date.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

In 2012, Shaffer appeared in ''[[12-12-12: The Concert for Sandy Relief]]'', where Shaffer accompanied [[Adam Sandler]]. The concert raised money for the people who were affected by [[Hurricane Sandy]] in October 2012. Later in 2012, Shaffer appeared in a skit of ''SNL Christmas'', which aired on Saturday, December 15, 2012. He appeared playing the piano and singing for the host [[Martin Short]].

In February 2013, he appeared in an episode of the sitcom ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]'' titled "[[P.S. I Love You (How I Met Your Mother)|P.S. I Love You]]", in which it is revealed that the character of Robin ([[Cobie Smulders]]) used to be obsessed with him. The letters "P.S." in the episode title refer to Paul Shaffer.
