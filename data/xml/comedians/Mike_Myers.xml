He made his directorial debut with the documentary ''[[Supermensch: The Legend of Shep Gordon]]'' (2013) and had a small role in [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s ''[[Inglourious Basterds]]'' (2009).

==Early life==
Myers was born on May 25, 1963&lt;ref name=tvg&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.tvguide.com/celebrities/mike-myers/bio/166681|title=Mike Myers Biography at|work=[[TV Guide]]|accessdate=October 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Scarborough, Toronto|Scarborough]], a suburban district in the east side of [[Toronto]], Ontario. He is the son of [[England|English-born]] parents Eric Myers (1922–1991), an insurance agent, and his wife, Alice E. Myers (née Hind; born 1926), an office supervisor and a veteran of the [[Royal Air Force]].&lt;ref name="tiscali1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tiscali.co.uk/entertainment/film/biographies/mike_myers_biog.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021016014221/http://www.tiscali.co.uk/entertainment/film/biographies/mike_myers_biog.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2002-10-16 |title=Mike Myers Biography at |publisher=[[TalkTalk Group|TalkTalk]] |accessdate=2013-05-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both of his parents were from [[Liverpool]], United Kingdom, and he has two older brothers, [[Paul Myers (musician)|Paul]], an [[indie rock]] [[singer-songwriter]], broadcaster, and author, and Peter, who worked for [[Sears Canada]].&lt;ref name="CBC"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harris|first1=Sophia|title=Employee featured in hit Sears Canada ad with famous brother Mike Myers loses job and severance|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/sears-mike-myers-ad-restructuring-lay-offs-1.4199261|accessdate=10 January 2018|work=CBC News|date=19 July 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The family is of [[English people|English]], [[Scottish people|Scottish]], and [[Irish people|Irish]] ancestry. Myers was raised [[Protestant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-89729450.html|title=Mike Myers: International Man of Mirth|first=Peter|last=Elson|publisher=Liverpool Daily Post|date=2002-07-27|accessdate=2008-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; He reportedly holds Canadian, U.S., and British citizenship.&lt;ref name="Harrison2005"/&gt;

Myers grew up in suburban Toronto districts, both [[North York]] and Scarborough,&lt;ref name="ottawa citizen"&gt;[http://www.ottawacitizen.com/entertainment/mike+myers+book+canada+relationship+with+home+country/12327434/story.html "Mike Myers on his new book 'Canada' and his relationship with his home country"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161031212226/http://www.ottawacitizen.com/entertainment/mike+myers+book+canada+relationship+with+home+country/12327434/story.html |date=2016-10-31 }}. Victoria Ahearn, The Canadian Press, via the ''Ottawa Citizen'', October 28, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; where he attended [[Sir John A. Macdonald Collegiate Institute]] and then graduated from [[Stephen Leacock Collegiate Institute]] in 1982.

==Career==
===Early career===

Myers began performing in commercials at the age of two. At the age of ten, he made a commercial for [[British Columbia Hydro]], with [[Gilda Radner]] playing his mother.&lt;ref name="tiscali1"/&gt; &lt;!--A few months later, according to Myers, his brother was teasing him about his "girlfriend [Radner] being on some stupid show on Saturday". Myers swore that one day he would also be on the same show, the then-fledgling ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.--&gt; At the age of 12, he made a guest appearance as Ari on the TV series ''[[King of Kensington]]''.

After graduating from high school, Myers was accepted into the ''[[The Second City|Second City]]'' Canadian touring company. He later moved to the United Kingdom, where in 1985 he was one of the founding members of [[The Comedy Store Players]], an improvisational group based at [[The Comedy Store, London|The Comedy Store]] in London.

The next year, he starred in the British children's TV program [[Wide Awake Club (television)|''Wide Awake Club'']], parodying the show's normal exuberance with his own "Sound Asleep Club", in partnership with [[Neil Mullarkey]].

He returned to [[Toronto]] and [[The Second City|Second City]] in 1986 as a cast member in the Second City's Toronto main stage show, [[Second City Theatre]].&lt;ref name=ott&gt;{{Cite web|title = Mike Myers|url = http://www.secondcity.com/people/other/mike-myers/|website = The Second City - 50 Years of Funny|accessdate = 2015-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, he moved from Second City in Toronto to [[Chicago]]. In Chicago, he trained, performed, and taught at the [[Improv Olympic]].

Myers made many appearances, including as Wayne Campbell, on Toronto's [[Citytv]] in the early 1980s, on the alternative video show ''City Limits'' hosted by [[Christopher Ward (songwriter)|Christopher Ward]]. Myers also appeared as Wayne Campbell in the music video for Ward's Canadian hit "Boys and Girls".

The Wayne Campbell character was featured extensively in the 1986 summer series ''[[It's Only Rock &amp; Roll (TV series)|It's Only Rock &amp; Roll]]'', produced by Toronto's Insight Production Company for [[CBC Television]]. Wayne appeared both in studio and in a series of location sketches directed and edited by [[Allan Novak]]. Myers wrote another sketch, "Kurt and Dieter", co-starring with Second City's [[Dana Andersen]] and also directed by Novak, which would later turn into the popular "[[Sprockets (Saturday Night Live)|Sprockets]]" sketch on ''Saturday Night Live''.

===Film===
Myers made his film debut when he and [[Dana Carvey]] adapted their [[Wayne's World]] ''[[Saturday Night Live|SNL]]'' sketches into the feature ''[[Wayne's World (film)|Wayne's World]]'' (1992). It was among the most successful movies of the year and was followed in 1993 by ''[[Wayne's World 2]]''; Myers starred in ''[[So I Married an Axe Murderer]]'' the same year. He took a two year hiatus from performing after the end of his time as an ''SNL'' regular.

Myers returned to acting with the film ''[[Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery]]'' (1997), followed by the sequels ''[[Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me]]'' (1999) and ''[[Austin Powers in Goldmember]]'' (2002). Myers played the title role ([[Austin Powers (character)|Austin Powers]]) and the villain ([[Dr. Evil]]), as well as other characters, in all three films.

One of Myers's rare non-comedic roles came in the film ''[[54 (film)|54]]'' (1998), in which he portrayed [[Steve Rubell]], proprietor of New York City's famous 1970s [[discotheque]] [[Studio 54]]. The film was not critically or commercially successful, though Myers received some positive notice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=O'Sullivan|first1=Michael|title='54': Rise and Fall of a Disco Inferno|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/movies/reviews/54osullivan.htm|website=WashingtonPost.com|publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]''|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IN '54,' MYERS WON'T SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/gossip/54-myers-won-set-record-straight-article-1.808414|website=NYDailyNews.com|publisher=''[[New York Daily News]]''|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later parodied the club as "Studio 69" in ''Goldmember''.

In June 2000, Myers was sued by [[Universal Pictures]] for {{USD}}3.8&amp;nbsp;million for backing out of a contract to play Dieter, the SNL character, in a feature film. Myers said he refused to honor the {{USD}}20&amp;nbsp;million contract because he did not want to cheat moviegoers with an unacceptable script—one that he himself had written. Myers countersued, and a settlement was reached after several months where Myers agreed to make another film with Universal. That film was ''[[The Cat in the Hat (film)|The Cat in the Hat]]'', which was released in November 2003 and starred Myers as the title character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Myers settles Dieter dispute|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/875852.stm|website=News.BBC.co.uk|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cosgrove-Mather|first1=Bootie|title=The Cat In The Hat Is Phat|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-cat-in-the-hat-is-phat/|website=CBSNews.com|publisher=[[CBS News]]|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Evans|first1=Bradford|title=‘Dieter’: The Surprisingly Funny Mike Myers Movie That Never Was|url=http://splitsider.com/2013/10/dieter-the-mike-myers-franchise-that-never-was/|website=Splitsider.com|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Myers provided the voice of [[Shrek (character)|Shrek]] in the [[DreamWorks Animation|DreamWorks]] animated film [[Shrek|of the same name]], having taken over the role after original planned voice actor [[Chris Farley]] died in December 1997. He reprised this role in ''[[Shrek 4-D]]'' (a theme park ride) in 2003, ''[[Shrek 2]]'' (2004), ''[[Shrek the Third]]'' (2007), and the Christmas special ''[[Shrek The Halls]]'' (2007).

Myers received the MTV Generation Award in June 2007, making him the second Canadian to win the award (following [[Jim Carrey]] in 2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Adler|first1=Shawn|title=MTV MOVIE AWARDS TO HONOR MIKE MYERS WITH GENERATION AWARD; 'NOW I'M SET,' HE SAYS|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1560861/mtv-movie-awards-to-honor-mike-myers-with-generation-award-now-im-set-he-says/|website=MTV.com|publisher=[[MTV]]|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Myers co-wrote, co-produced, and starred in ''[[The Love Guru]]''. In 2009, he played the part of British general Ed Fenech, in [[Quentin Tarantino|Quentin Tarantino's]] ''[[Inglourious Basterds]]''. In 2010 Myers returned for the latest film in the ''Shrek'' series, ''[[Shrek Forever After]]''.

Myers returned to onscreen film acting with supporting roles in ''[[Terminal (2018 film)|Terminal]]'' (2018)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Darby|first1=Luke|title=Mike Myers Filmed His Own Zombie Movie Between Takes for ''Terminal''|url=https://www.gq.com/story/mike-myers-zombie-movie-between-takes|website=GQ.com|publisher=[[GQ]]|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Bohemian Rhapsody (film)|Bohemian Rhapsody]]'' (2018).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Desta|first1=Yohana|title=In Perfect Casting News, Mike Myers Is Joining ''Bohemian Rhapsody''|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/09/mike-myers-bohemian-rhapsody|website=VanityFair.com|publisher=''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]''|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other work===

In a 2005 poll to find The Comedian's Comedian, he was voted among the top 50 comedy acts ever by fellow comedians and comedy insiders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thorpe|first1=Vanessa|title=Cook tops poll of comedy greats|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/jan/02/arts.artsnews|website=TheGuardian.com|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Myers is a member of the band [[Ming Tea]] along with [[The Bangles]]' guitarist and vocalist [[Susanna Hoffs]] and musician [[Matthew Sweet]]. They performed the songs "BBC" and "Daddy Wasn't There" from the ''Austin Powers'' movies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Great Fictional Bands: MING TEA - UPDATE 4/11/14|url=http://www.warpedfactor.com/2014/09/great-fictional-bands-ming-tea.html|website=WarpedFactor.com|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 Myers returned to The Comedy Store in London to perform a one-time reprisal of his role with The Comedy Store Players. The UK comedy website Chortle praised his performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Butler|first=Marc|title=Mike Myers &amp; The Comedy Store Players 3/7/2011|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/shows/misc_live_shows/c/18807/the_comedy_store_players/review|work=Chortle Live Review|publisher=Chortle|accessdate=2011-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Myers's 2013 directorial debut, ''[[Supermensch: The Legend of Shep Gordon]]'', was selected to be screened in the Gala Presentation section at the [[2013 Toronto International Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="TIFF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tiff.net/filmsandschedules/festival/2013/supermensch|title=Supermensch The Legend of Shep Gordon|accessdate=2013-08-06|work=TIFF|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130914222630/http://tiff.net/filmsandschedules/festival/2013/supermensch|archivedate=2013-09-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 2017, Myers began hosting a reprised version of ''[[The Gong Show]]'' in heavy makeup as a fictional British host known as Tommy Maitland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zuckerman|first1=Esther|title=Mike Myers’ disappearing act|url=https://theoutline.com/post/4577/mike-myers-very-intriguing-person?zd=2&amp;zi=ywrqcrmm|publisher=The Outline|accessdate=19 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Myers began dating actress and comedy writer Robin Ruzan in the late 1980s after meeting at a hockey game in [[Chicago]], during which Myers caught a [[puck (sports)|puck]] and used the incident as an icebreaker to strike up a conversation with Ruzan. The couple married on May 22, 1993, and Myers later referred to Ruzan as "his muse".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/pagesix/mike_and_kelly_wed_in_secret_KXds3MX5f4UdjiN850gXeN|title=Mike and Kelly wed in secret|publisher=New York Post|date=2011-03-04|accessdate=2011-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/mike-myers-why-does-everyone-want-to-get-into-bed-with-him-184062.html|title=Mike Myers: Why does everyone want to get into bed with him?|publisher=independent.co.uk|date=July 13, 2002|accessdate=December 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple filed for divorce in December 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.ninemsn.com.au/entertainment/78858/mike-myers-wife-file-for-divorce-report|title=Mike Myers, wife file for divorce: report|publisher=MSN|date=2005-12-24|accessdate=2011-03-04|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004155417/http://news.ninemsn.com.au/entertainment/78858/mike-myers-wife-file-for-divorce-report|archivedate=2012-10-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a CBS interview in 2007, he noted that he normally takes three years between films. He spends one year "living his life" and then writes various screenplays, develops characters, practices them in front of live audiences, and then selects one of the screenplays to film.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

In 2014, Myers starred in a commercial with his brother Peter for [[Sears Canada]], using "humorous banter to spread the message that, despite rumours, Sears wasn't shutting down".
