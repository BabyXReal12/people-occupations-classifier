==Characters==

===Monk===
Monk is a cynical monkey who is continually insulting Conti and swearing when he does not have his demands fulfilled. He often deliberately shows irritation towards performing on stage and makes Conti laugh at his words.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2081260/|title=Her Master's Voice|date=6 February 2014|publisher=|via=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shoard"&gt;{{cite news |last=Shoard |first=Catherine |date=15 March 2012 |title=Nina Conti: 'I feel it's not in my film how much I miss Ken' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/mar/15/nina-conti-ventriloquist-ken-campbell |newspaper=The Guardian |access-date=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;He now appears in a new cartoon on TV series Pop

===Granny===
Granny is an elderly Scotswoman to whom Conti refers as someone who is a lot like her own grandmother. Granny often chides Conti for the simplest things Conti has done; for instance, when Conti reveals she has two legs, Granny responds by saying "Oh, two legs? You're spoiling me!" Her main act is to telepathically guess numbers or words, which she always guesses correctly. She also talks about her dead husband, Frank. Granny refers to people with words like "dear", "child" or "my daughter". The original prop was donated to [[Vent Haven Museum]] in July 2009, in memory of Ken Campbell, from whom Conti received her,&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; but Conti had a replica made which she continues to use in her acts.

===Face mask===
The face mask, rather than an actual puppet with a personality, is a mask that covers the lower half of an audience participant's face and can be manipulated by a hand-piece held by Conti to make it look like the participant is talking. Conti often uses this to put the participant in awkward and funny situations, such as making them say that they want nothing more than to dance in front of the audience, while their body language suggests the opposite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4BB1TZcO_o|title=Nina Conti on Russel Howard's Good News|first=|last=Angela Ritwo|date=2 June 2012|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Conti was in a relationship with the comedian and actor [[Ken Campbell]]; from him she inherited his collection of ventriloquist dummies.&lt;ref name="Shoard"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Johnston |first=Jenny |date=12 July 2012 |title=The ventriloquist who found her voice: Tom Conti's daughter on how her affair with a much older man gave her the confidence to go on stage |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2172824/The-ventriloquist-voice-Tom-Contis-daughter-affair-older-man-gave-confidence-stage.html |newspaper=[[Daily Mail]] |access-date=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Dessau |first=Bruce |author-link=Bruce Dessau |date=4 May 2013 |title=Nina Conti: The acclaimed ventriloquist on the seductions of acting and throat-singing |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/nina-conti-the-acclaimed-ventriloquist-on-the-seductions-of-acting-and-throat-singing-8599847.html |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |access-date=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was married to Andrew "Stan" Stanley with whom she has had two children.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

On 24 July 2015, Nina received an honorary degree from the University of East Anglia and was made a doctor of letters.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}
