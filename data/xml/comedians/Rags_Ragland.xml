'''Rags Ragland''' (born '''John Lee Morgan Beauregard Ragland''', August 23, 1905 – August 20, 1946) was an American comedian and [[character actor]].

==Personal life==
Ragland was born on August 23, 1905, in [[Louisville, Kentucky]], to parents Adam Joseph Ragland and Stella Petty.

As a youth, he worked as a truck driver, [[boxing|boxer]], and movie projectionist in Kentucky.  He was briefly married to Sabina Elizabeth Vanover and they had one child, a son named John Griffin Ragland (1925-1990), before they divorced in 1926. The following year, at the age of 22, Ragland moved to [[Los Angeles]].

Ragland made his show business reputation in [[burlesque]]. He quickly became known for his wild ad-libs, unpredictable intrusions into other comics' acts, and a "healthy off-stage libido". Eventually he worked his way up to "top banana" at [[Minsky's Burlesque|Minsky's]], the dominant burlesque house.&lt;ref&gt;Rags Ragland biography. [https://www.nytimes.com/movies/person/58487/Rags-Ragland/biography New York ''Times'' archive]. Retrieved March 19, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Minsky striptease star Georgia Sothern remembered him fondly in her 1971 memoir, saying she considered Ragland a close friend and the funniest comedian the Minskys had ever produced.&lt;ref&gt;Sothern, G. ''Georgia: My Life in Burlesque''. New American Library (1972), p. 62. ASIN: B000JI9BB2.&lt;/ref&gt; His longtime performing partner [[Phil Silvers]] referred to Ragland in his autobiography as "my favorite comic".&lt;ref&gt;Silvers P, Saffron R. ''This Laugh Is On Me''. New York, Prentice-Hall (1973), p. 134. {{ISBN|0139191003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After burlesque in its classic style died, Ragland made his way to [[Broadway theatre]] and films. He usually playing good-natured oafs with a knack for fracturing the English language. He became a  [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM) contract player beginning with 1942's ''[[Panama Hattie (film)|Panama Hattie]]'', reprising a role he played on Broadway. Ragland appeared in around two dozen MGM light comedies and musicals. He gained popularity as [[Red Skelton]]'s cohort in the "Whistling" movies (''[[Whistling in the Dark (1941 film)|Whistling in the Dark]]'', ''[[Whistling in Dixie]]'', and ''[[Whistling in Brooklyn]]''). His final film appearance was in the drama  ''[[The Hoodlum Saint]]'' (1946).

==Death==
After returning from an alcoholic bender with [[Orson Welles]] in [[Mexico]] in 1946, Ragland was scheduled to revive his New York nightclub act with friend [[Phil Silvers]] at the [[Copacabana (nightclub)|Copacabana]]. He began experiencing pain in his abdomen and was hospitalized. Good friend [[Frank Sinatra]] called in a specialist, but the doctors determined that Ragland's [[liver]] and [[kidney]]s were destroyed from years of [[alcohol abuse]]. After falling into a coma, he died, three days before his 41st birthday, of [[uremia]]. Silvers and Sinatra were by his bedside. Many [[Hollywood]] celebrities attended Ragland's funeral &amp;ndash; Sinatra sang at the service and Silvers delivered the eulogy.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

In a gesture of friendship and respect, Sinatra left the set of his movie ''[[It Happened in Brooklyn]]'', flew to New York, and unexpectedly showed up to take Ragland's spot with Silvers at the Copacabana debut (Silvers had decided to continue because he had signed a contract, stating "the show must go on"). Sinatra and Silvers did the routines they had performed during their [[USO tour]]s. The show brought down the house. It ended with Silvers saying in tears, "May I take a bow for Rags." The audience was silent, crying in tribute to Ragland.&lt;ref&gt;Silvers (1973), p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;
