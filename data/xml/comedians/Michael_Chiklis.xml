'''Michael Charles Chiklis''' (born August 30, 1963) is an [[United States|American]] actor and [[television producer]]. He is perhaps best known for his role as [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] Detective [[Vic Mackey]] on the [[FX (TV channel)|FX]] police drama ''[[The Shield]]'', for which he won the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series]]. He is also known for playing Commissioner Tony Scali on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] police drama ''[[The Commish]]'', [[Thing (comics)|The Thing]] in the [[Fantastic Four (film series)|''Fantastic Four'' film series]], and Jim Powell on the ABC science-fiction comedy-drama ''[[No Ordinary Family]]''. Additionally, he co-starred as Vincent Savino in the [[CBS]] crime drama ''[[Vegas (2012 TV series)|Vegas]]''. In 2014 Chiklis joined the cast of ''[[American Horror Story]]'' for its fourth season, ''[[American Horror Story: Freak Show]]''. The following year he was cast as Nathaniel Barnes, in the second season of [[Gotham (TV series)|''Gotham'']]'','' as a series regular.

==Early life==
Chiklis was born in [[Lowell, Massachusetts]]. His mother, Katherine (née Vousboukis), is a hospital administrative aide, and his father, Charlie Chiklis, runs a hair/beauty salon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/19/Michael-Chiklis.html |title=Michael Chiklis Biography (1963–) |publisher=Filmreference.com |date= |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/access/62037545.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Nov+15%2C+1994&amp;author=Susan+Bickelhaupt%2C+Globe+Staff&amp;pub=Boston+Globe+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&amp;desc=Mother+knows+best&amp;pqatl=google | work=Boston Globe | first=Susan | last=Bickelhaupt | title=Mother knows best | date=November 15, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chiklis has been described as inheriting his acting ability from his mother.&lt;ref name="cigar-aficionado"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Susan Karlin|author2=Vincent McMahon|url=http://www.cigaraficionado.com/webfeatures/show/id/7286/p/5|title=Michael Chiklis: Hollywood Survivor|date=November 1999|publisher=''[[Cigar Aficionado]]''|accessdate=October 30, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004234259/http://www.cigaraficionado.com/webfeatures/show/id/7286/p/5|archive-date=October 4, 2013|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father is a second-generation [[Greek American]] (his parental ancestors came from [[Lesbos]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maximonline.com/articles/index.aspx?a_id=5005 Good Cop, Bald Cop Article on Maxim.com :: Hot Girls, Babes, Sex, Photos, Videos, Gear, Entertainment&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and his mother is of [[Greeks|Greek]] and [[Irish people|Irish]] descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/MichaelChiklis/status/48481803421487104 |title=Twitter / MichaelChiklis: I know everyone thinks of me |publisher=Twitter.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chiklis grew up in [[Andover, Massachusetts]]&lt;ref name="eagle-tribune-andover"&gt;{{cite news|last=Lucas|first=Drake|url=http://www.eagletribune.com/local/x1876439011/Michael-Chiklis-gets-his-day-in-Andover|title=Michael Chiklis gets his day in Andover|date=June 28, 2008|publisher=''[[The Eagle-Tribune]]''|accessdate=October 30, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130122100839/http://www.eagletribune.com/local/x1876439011/Michael-Chiklis-gets-his-day-in-Andover|archivedate=January 22, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and began entertaining his family with celebrity imitations when he was five years old. As a child, Chiklis appeared in regional theater productions and became a member of the [[Actors' Equity Association]] at age thirteen. In the ninth grade, he portrayed Hawkeye Pierce in [[Andover High School (Massachusetts)|Andover High School]]'s production of ''[[M*A*S*H#Plays|M*A*S*H]]''.&lt;ref name="eagle-tribune-andover" /&gt; He later attended [[Boston University College of Fine Arts]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bu.edu/cfa/2012/08/23/bu-alums-michael-chiklis-and-gary-fleder-on-the-set-of-cbss-new-series-vegas/|title=BU alums Michael Chiklis and Gary Fleder on the set of CBS’s new series "Vegas"|date=August 23, 2012|publisher=bu.edu|accessdate=30 October 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120827213430/http://www.bu.edu/cfa/2012/08/23/bu-alums-michael-chiklis-and-gary-fleder-on-the-set-of-cbss-new-series-vegas/|archivedate=27 August 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he received a [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bu.edu/cfa/alumni/theatre/|title=School of Theatre Distinguished Awards|publisher=bu.edu|accessdate=30 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

After graduation, Chiklis moved to [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City]] and was cast in the role of [[John Belushi]] in the controversial biopic ''[[Wired (film)|Wired]]'' in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Stone|first=Stone|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=iGJWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=u_EDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6651,5067182&amp;dq=graduation+michael+chiklis+moved+to+new+york&amp;hl=en|title=Michael Chiklis: The show that could|date=May 17, 1995|publisher=''[[The Spokesman-Review]]''|accessdate=October 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was panned in general and flopped at the box office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=MN&amp;p_theme=mn&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EFE4816026B34E6&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|title=`Wired,' film adaptation of Belushi's life, has two good mimics, one bad plot|date=August 28, 1989|publisher=''[[Minneapolis Star-Tribune]]''|accessdate=October 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also guest starred in several popular television series such as ''[[Miami Vice]]'', ''[[B.L. Stryker]]'', ''[[Wiseguy]]'', ''[[L.A. Law]]'', ''[[Murphy Brown]]'', and ''[[Seinfeld]]'' alongside bit parts in films like ''[[Nixon (film)|Nixon]]''.

Chiklis's first successful role was in ''[[The Commish]]'', a police comedy/drama that ran from 1991–1996 on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]].  Chiklis played Anthony "Tony" J. Scali, a [[police commissioner]] in a small city in [[upstate New York]].  After ''The Commish'', Chiklis starred in the short-lived [[NBC]] sitcom ''[[Daddio]]''.

After playing [[Curly Howard]] in the 2000 TV movie ''[[The Three Stooges (2000 film)|The Three Stooges]]'', Chiklis decided to reinvent his image. With his wife's help, he spent six months on an extensive workout regimen and shaved his head. He turned up to audition for ''[[The Shield]]'' looking nothing like the pudgy, friendly character of ''The Commish''. Winning over creator [[Shawn Ryan]], Chiklis nabbed the leading role of the show's [[anti-hero]], [[LAPD]] Detective [[Vic Mackey]]. He won the 2002 [[Emmy Award]] for Outstanding Lead Actor In A Drama Series for the role. Chiklis received a [[Golden Globe Award]] that same year for Best Performance by an Actor in a Television Series-Drama as well. Between 2004 and 2005, he was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Drama Series but did not win. Chiklis later parodied his role as Vic Mackey in "Monstourage," an episode of ''[[Robot Chicken]]''. The skit involved Mackey accidentally switching places with [[Ben Grimm]].

[[File:Michael Chiklis.jpg|thumb|Chiklis in 2007 promoting ''Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer'']]
Since 2000, Chiklis has taken up a number of voice roles, voicing Chihiro's father, Akio, in the [[English language|English]] dub of [[Hayao Miyazaki]]'s ''[[Spirited Away]]'' and Roman/King Webster in the [[direct-to-video]] feature ''[[The Adventures of Tom Thumb and Thumbelina]]''. He has also performed in several episodes of ''[[Family Guy]]'' and had a voice role in ''[[Heavy Gear#TV series|Heavy Gear: The Animated Series]]''.

In 2005, he starred in ''[[Fantastic Four (2005 film)|Fantastic Four]]'' as [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] and reprised the role in its 2007 sequel, ''[[Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer]]''. Being a fan of the comic book series, he had dreamed of playing the character if ever there was a Fantastic Four movie being produced. Chiklis was often praised for his performance in a film that otherwise earned mixed reviews. His wife visited him on set during the filming but was not aware that he would be in his full bodysuit and makeup as The Thing; she was totally unprepared for seeing him like that and found it very distressing, having to be guided from the set in order to collect herself.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Chiklis had a role in the 2008 film ''[[Eagle Eye]]'' as the [[United States Secretary of Defense]].

In the wake of [[Bernard Madoff]] scandal, Chiklis is developing a series at [[FX (TV channel)|FX]] about a similar investment scheme. The project, called ''House of Cards'', concerns a group committing an elaborate scam similar to the Madoff fraud. Chiklis had been developing the project since February 2008 after he and his wife became victims of a [[Ponzi scheme]] themselves. ''Cards'' will likely center on the leader of the scheme, with Chiklis planning to [[Executive Producer|executive produce]] but not star.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3i213af1e960abb3d8de7eb6c944521172 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220212627/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3i213af1e960abb3d8de7eb6c944521172 |archivedate=December 20, 2008|title=It's in the 'Cards' for Michael Chiklis|first1=James|last1=Hibberd|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chiklis later starred in the ABC television series ''[[No Ordinary Family]]'', which premiered on September 28, 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ram|first=Archana|url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2010/09/28/no-ordinary-family-premieres-tonight-will-you-be-watching|title='No Ordinary Family' premieres tonight: Will you be watching?|date=September 28, 2010|publisher=ew.com|accessdate=October 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of the [[2010–2011 United States network television schedule|2010–11 television season]]&lt;ref name=pickup&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hollywoodinsider.ew.com/2010/05/12/breaking-abc-picks-up-no-ordinary-family-starring-michael-chiklis/ |title=Breaking: ABC picks up 'No Ordinary Family' starring Michael Chikilis |date=May 12, 2010 |last=Rice |first=Lynette |work=Entertainment Weekly |accessdate=May 12, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100513032516/http://hollywoodinsider.ew.com/2010/05/12/breaking-abc-picks-up-no-ordinary-family-starring-michael-chiklis/ |archivedate=May 13, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ended in April, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gorman|first=Bill|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2011/05/13/v-cancelled-brothers-sisters-cancelled-by-abc-too/92307/|title=Updated: 'V' Cancelled; 'Brothers &amp; Sisters,' 'Mr. Sunshine,' 'Detroit 187,' 'Off The Map,' 'No Ordinary Family' Cancelled Too|date=May 13, 2011|publisher=tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com|accessdate=October 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also co-starred in the [[CBS]] Crime drama ''[[Vegas (2012 TV series)|Vegas]]''.

In March 2014, it was announced that Chiklis had been cast in ''[[American Horror Story: Freak Show]]'', the fourth season of the [[FX (network)|FX]] anthology series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2014/03/28/chiklis-ahs-freak-show/|title=Michael Chiklis joins the cast of ''American Horror Story: Freak Show''|publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=March 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 Chiklis also played a small part towards the end of the FX series ''[[Sons of Anarchy]]'', where he appears first on the episode 'Rose Red', he played a trucker who first encounters Gemma on her way to her father at a truck stop. Then in the series finale, his character drives his tractor-trailer truck head-first (unintentionally) into [[Jax Teller]].

In 2015 he appeared in ''[[Gotham (TV series)|Gotham]]'' as Captain Nathaniel Barnes.&lt;ref&gt;Highfill, Samantha [http://www.ew.com/article/2015/10/12/gotham-michael-chiklis Michael Chiklis is ready to get his hands dirty on Gotham October 12, 2015] ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' Retrieved October 13, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In a nod to Chiklis' time on the Strike Team on ''[[The Shield]]'', his character established a similarly named "Strike Force".
Michael Chiklis will be releasing his first solo album “INFLUENCE" in September 2016. Chiklis wrote and produced the album at his own Extravaganza Music Studio.

==Personal life==
Chiklis married Michelle Moran on June 21, 1992, and they have two daughters: Autumn, born on October 9, 1993, and Odessa, born in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004821/bio IMDB Biography of Mike Chiklis]&lt;/ref&gt;  Autumn played Vic Mackey's daughter Cassidy on ''The Shield''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news-article/chiklis-bans-daughter-from-watching-her-own-show|title=CHIKLIS BANS DAUGHTER FROM WATCHING HER OWN SHOW|date=March 24, 2004|publisher=contactmusic.com|accessdate=October 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A lifelong comic book fan, he rarely turns down an autograph request from children.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|4821|section=bio}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, according to the DVD commentary for the ''Fantastic Four'' film, his voice has been going hoarse from doing [[Thing (comics)|The Thing]]'s voice so many times; in Chiklis' own words: &lt;blockquote&gt;How do you say "no" to an 8-year-old?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Chiklis is a fan of both the [[Boston Red Sox]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=FzsyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=4-QFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5866,935202&amp;dq=boston+red+sox+michael+chiklis&amp;hl=en|title='Shield' star moves on to bigger Thing|date=July 1, 2005|publisher=''[[TimesDaily]]''|accessdate=October 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Boston Bruins]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bobbin|first=Jay|url=http://blog.zap2it.com/pop2it/2011/06/boston-bruins-fan-michael-chiklis-watching-stanley-cup-finals-like-a-hawk.html|title=Boston Bruins fan Michael Chiklis watching Stanley Cup Finals 'like a hawk'|date=June 9, 2011|publisher=zap2it.com|accessdate=October 30, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110909234640/http://blog.zap2it.com/pop2it/2011/06/boston-bruins-fan-michael-chiklis-watching-stanley-cup-finals-like-a-hawk.html|archivedate=September 9, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was interviewed for the [[HBO]] documentary ''[[The Curse of the Bambino]]'' about the Red Sox's long struggle to win the [[World Series]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jurkowitz|first=Mark|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/tv/articles/2003/09/16/hbo_takes_a_powerful_swing_at_explaining_sox_sad_history/|title=HBO takes a powerful swing at explaining Sox' sad history|date=September 16, 2003|publisher=''[[The Boston Globe]]''|accessdate=October 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and narrated the video introduction of the [[New England Patriots]] in [[Super Bowl XXXIX]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wilson|first=Dave|url=http://espn.go.com/espn/page2/index?id=5625318|title=Michael Chiklis: No ordinary Boston sports fan|publisher=espn.go.com|accessdate=October 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his stint on American Horror Story: Freakshow, Chiklis told [[Larry King]] that he did not enjoy working on the show: 'That was one of the darkest years of my career. It was, I think, it’s one thing to do a horror film in the context of like two months or something like that, but to live in that for six months it just became, I don’t know. Maybe it’s because I’m an empathetic person, and I just sometimes start to take things on. But it was so dark, and it was so nasty'.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ora.tv/larrykingnow/2016/10/19/why-michael-chiklis-wont-return-to-ahs&lt;/ref&gt;
