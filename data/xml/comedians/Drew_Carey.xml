''' Drew Allison Carey'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/DrewFromTV/status/743201079085539328|title=Drew Carey on Twitter|website=Twitter|access-date=2016-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; (born May 23, 1958) is an American actor, comedian, sports executive, and [[game show host]]. After serving in the [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]] and making a name for himself in [[stand-up comedy]], Carey eventually gained popularity starring in his own [[Situation comedy|sitcom]], ''[[The Drew Carey Show]]'', and serving as host of the U.S. version of the improv comedy show [[Whose Line Is It Anyway? (U.S. TV series)|''Whose Line Is It Anyway?'']], both of which aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]].

Drew Carey has appeared in several films, television series, music videos, a made-for-television film, and a computer game. He has hosted the [[game show]] ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]'' since 2007 on [[CBS]]. He is interested in a variety of sports and has worked as a photographer at [[United States men's national soccer team|U.S. National Team soccer games]]. He is a minority owner of the [[Major League Soccer]] team [[Seattle Sounders FC]]. Carey has written an autobiography, ''[[Dirty Jokes and Beer|Dirty Jokes and Beer: Stories of the Unrefined]]'', detailing his early life and television career.

==Early life==

He continued on to college at [[Kent State University]] (KSU) and was a part of Delta Tau Delta Fraternity. He was expelled twice for poor academic performance. He left KSU after three years. After leaving the university, Carey enlisted into the [[United States Marine Corps Reserve]] in 1981 and served for six years.&lt;ref name="Cleveland.com"/&gt; He moved to [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] for a few months in 1983, and for a short time worked as a [[bank teller]] and a waiter at [[Denny's]].&lt;ref name="Cleveland.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="USAWeek"/&gt;

==Stand-up career==
In 1985, he began his comedy career by following up on a suggestion by [[David H. Lawrence XVII|David Lawrence]] (a disc jockey friend who had been paying Drew to write jokes for David's radio show in Cleveland) to go to the library and borrow books on how to write jokes.&lt;ref name="LibraryJokes"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Mervis |first=Scott |title=Comedy Preview: Drew Carey rocks! |work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/ae/20020927drew3.asp |date=September 27, 2002 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60E4zTLu9?url=http://www.post-gazette.com/ae/20020927drew3.asp |archivedate=July 16, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bookish"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Johnson|first=Dean|title=Bookish comic is a quick study|work=[[Boston Herald]]|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/bostonherald/access/68242241.html?dids=68242241:68242241&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jun+10%2C+1994&amp;author=Dean+Johnson&amp;pub=Boston+Herald&amp;desc=COMEDY+Bookish+comic+is+a+quick+study&amp;pqatl=google|format=Fee required|date=June 10, 1994|accessdate=July 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, after winning an open-microphone contest, he became [[Master of Ceremonies]] at the Cleveland Comedy Club.&lt;ref name="All Movie Guide"/&gt; He performed at comedy clubs over the next few years in Cleveland and Los Angeles.

==Acting career==

===Early roles===
His early stand-up career led to supporting roles on television shows, during which he developed the character of a hapless middle-class bachelor. In 1993, Carey had a small role in the film ''[[Coneheads]]'' as a taxi passenger. In 1994, Carey co-starred with [[John Caponera]] in ''[[The Good Life (1994 TV series)|The Good Life]]'', a short-lived [[Situation comedy|sitcom]] on [[NBC]].&lt;ref name="GoodLife"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Bickelhaupt|first=Susan|title=Drew Carey's 'Good Life'|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=BG&amp;p_theme=bg&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EADE0BE65C28420&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|registration=yes|date=March 15, 1994|accessdate=July 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the show was cancelled, [[Bruce Helford]], a writer on the show, hired Carey as a consultant for the television show ''Someone Like Me''.&lt;ref name="SomeoneMe"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Johnson |first=Allan |title=Drew Carey Succeeds By Being Himself |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1997-11-16/news/9711160210_1_drew-carey-show-character-working |date=November 16, 1997 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60E5RNF28?url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1997-11-16/news/9711160210_1_drew-carey-show-character-working |archivedate=July 16, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Drew Carey Show''===
After their stint on ''Someone Like Me'', Carey and Helford developed and produced the storyline for ''[[The Drew Carey Show]]''. The sitcom revolved around a fictionalized version of Carey, as he took on the stresses of life and work with his group of childhood friends. The show premiered on September 13, 1995, on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. In his autobiography, Carey revealed his frustration with having to deal with [[censorship|censors]] and being unable to employ the [[off-color humor]] common in his stand-up routines.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Carey initially earned $60,000 per episode in the first seasons, then renegotiated for $300,000.&lt;ref name="DCSSalary"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Huff |first=Richard |title=Drew to Carey on with Sitcom &amp; Laugh All the Way to the Bank |work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]] |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/1998/02/27/1998-02-27_drew_to_carey_on_with_sitcom.html |date=February 27, 1998 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60E5VFktv?url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/1998-02-27/entertainment/18067265_1_drew-carey-show-wb-network-morning-america |archivedate=July 16, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the final season, he was earning $750,000 per episode.&lt;ref name="DCSSalaryFinal"&gt;{{Cite news |author=[[Associated Press]] |title=Drew Carey going out with a whisper |work=[[USA Today]] |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2004-05-03-carey-going-off-air_x.htm |date=May 3, 2004 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60E5erF1f?url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2004-05-03-carey-going-off-air_x.htm |archivedate=July 16, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The show had high ratings for its first few seasons, but declining ratings and increasing production costs (around $3 million per episode) precipitated its cancellation.&lt;ref name="DCSSalaryFinal"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gillespie |first=Nick |author2=Steve Kurtz |title=Stand-Up Guy |work=[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]] |url=http://reason.com/archives/1997/11/01/stand-up-guy |date=November 1997 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60Fw91hGn?url=http://reason.com/archives/1997/11/01/stand-up-guy |archivedate=July 17, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The program had a total of 233 episodes over its nine-year run, and Carey was one of four actors to appear in every episode.

===Improv television===
While still starring in ''The Drew Carey Show'', Carey began hosting the American version of the [[improvisational theatre|improvisational comedy]] show ''[[Whose Line Is It Anyway? (U.S. TV series)|Whose Line Is It Anyway?]]'' in 1998. He would announce the improv guests, direct the games, and then would usually involve himself in the final game of the episode. The show ran for a total of 220 episodes until the show's cancellation in 2006. In 1998, the [[New York Friars' Club]] made Carey the newest inductee of the group's [[Comedy Central Roast]]. His friend [[Ryan Stiles]] (who costarred in ''The Drew Carey Show'' and ''Whose Line Is It Anyway?'') served as the roastmaster.&lt;ref name="Roast"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Siano |first=Joseph |title=Now Roasting (and Toasting) Drew Carey |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/25/tv/signoff-now-roasting-and-toasting-drew-carey.html |date=October 25, 1998 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60E5x8BXm?url=http://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/25/tv/signoff-now-roasting-and-toasting-drew-carey.html |archivedate=July 16, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Carey's income from ''Whose Line Is It Anyway?'' and ''The Drew Carey Show'' led to his inclusion on the ''[[Forbes]]'' list of highest-paid entertainers of 1998, at 24th with $45.5 million.&lt;ref name="ArtEnter"&gt;{{Cite news |agency=[[Associated Press]] |title=Hometown hero comes back to Cleveland |work=[[Lubbock Avalanche-Journal]] |url=http://www.lubbockonline.com/stories/091799/ent_0917990034.shtml |date=September 17, 1999 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60E5zUrfr?url=http://lubbockonline.com/stories/091799/ent_0917990034.shtml |archivedate=July 16, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[The WB Television Network|the WB's]] 2004–2005 [[prime time]] schedule, Carey co-produced and starred in ''[[Drew Carey's Green Screen Show]]'', a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of ''Whose Line Is It Anyway?''.&lt;ref name="GreenScreen"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Bianculli |first=David |title='Green' Can't Be Improv-ed On |work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]] |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/2004/10/07/2004-10-07__green__can_t_be_improv-ed_on.html |date=October 7, 2004 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60E66sIRv?url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/2004/10/07/2004-10-07__green__can_t_be_improv-ed_on.html |archivedate=July 16, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was canceled by the WB, but picked up shortly afterward by Comedy Central.&lt;ref name="GSCC"&gt;{{Cite news |last=MacDonald |first=Patrick |title=Drew Carey, funny friends open Seattle Comedy Festival |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/entertainment/2002561779_improv15.html |date=October 15, 2005 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60E689MzF?url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/entertainment/2002561779_improv15.html |archivedate=July 16, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The show's premise relied on the use of a [[green screen]] for all of the actors' improv interactions. Animation on the screen was inserted during post-production.

In April 2011, Carey began hosting a primetime improv show, called ''[[Drew Carey's Improv-A-Ganza]]''. It was filmed at the [[MGM Grand Las Vegas|MGM Grand]] in Las Vegas, Nevada, and first aired on April 11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Wedel |first=Mark |title=They find freedom in live shows: 'Whose Line' vet Ryan Stiles talks tiger blood, psychic links and why no one likes Drew Carey |work=[[Kalamazoo Gazette]] |url=http://www.mlive.com/entertainment/kalamazoo/index.ssf/2011/06/they_find_freedom_in_live_show.html |date=June 2, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60E6ZDMJN?url=http://www.mlive.com/entertainment/kalamazoo/index.ssf/2011/06/they_find_freedom_in_live_show.html |archivedate=July 16, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The show took on the premise of ''Whose Line?'' and ''Drew Carey's Green Screen Show'' in that it features many of the same performers from both shows and did improv based on audience-provided suggestions.

===Improv All-Stars===
Carey was one of the founders of the Improv All-Stars, a group of eleven actors who perform in unscripted skits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kraisirideja |first=Sandra |title='Whose Line' co-star relishing 'Improv All-Stars' tour |url=http://www.nctimes.com/entertainment/art-and-theater/theater/article_40560dfb-1251-5fe1-ab75-70c2354f59ae.html |work=[[North County Times]] |date=October 27, 2004 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60E70rDWn?url=http://www.nctimes.com/entertainment/art-and-theater/theater/article_40560dfb-1251-5fe1-ab75-70c2354f59ae.html |archivedate=July 16, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The group joined Carey in all three of his improv shows, ''Whose Line Is It Anyway?'', ''Drew Carey's Green Screen Show'', and ''Drew Carey's Improv-A-Ganza'', and some members had major roles or guest-starred on ''The Drew Carey Show''.&lt;ref name="ImprovAll"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Swift|first=Orla|title='Drew Carey' improv keeps the cast united|work=[[The News &amp; Observer]]|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=RLOB&amp;p_theme=rlob&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;s_dispstring=%28Drew%20Carey%20improv%20keeps%20the%20cast%20united%29&amp;p_field_advanced-0=&amp;p_text_advanced-0=%28Drew%20Carey%20improv%20keeps%20the%20cast%20united%29&amp;xcal_numdocs=20&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;xcal_useweights=no|date=November 9, 2005|accessdate=July 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Improv All-Stars travel on comedy tours, performing at comedy clubs throughout the United States.

==Game show host==

===''Power of 10''===
Beginning in 2007, Carey began hosting [[game show]]s, beginning with his April selection as host of the [[CBS]] game show pilot ''[[Power of 10 (U.S. game show)|Power of 10]]''. The show ran from August 7, 2007 to January 23, 2008 and aired twice weekly during the late summer and early fall. Each game featured contestants predicting how a cross-section of Americans responded to questions covering a wide variety of topics in polls conducted by CBS.&lt;ref name="Power10"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Hale |first=Mike |title=Drew Carey's "Power of 10" draws on his persona |work=[[The Denver Post]] |url=http://www.denverpost.com/ci_6633628?source=bb |date=August 17, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090710012107/http://www.denverpost.com/ci_6633628?source=bb |archivedate=July 10, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Price Is Right''===
After taping the [[pilot episode]] for ''Power of 10'', Carey was contacted by CBS about replacing [[Bob Barker]]—who had earlier announced his own retirement—as host of ''[[The Price Is Right]]''. After initially turning down the offer, Carey announced on ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' that he would succeed Barker as host of the program beginning in the fall of 2007.&lt;ref name="LetterHost"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Bauder |first=David |publisher=[[Fox News Channel|Fox News]] |title='Price Is Right' for Drew Carey |url=http://www.foxnews.com/printer_friendly_wires/2007Jul23/0,4675,TVPriceCarey,00.html |date=July 23, 2007 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60E7JxXgX?url=http://www.foxnews.com/printer_friendly_wires/2007Jul23/0,4675,TVPriceCarey,00.html |archivedate=July 16, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; His first episode of ''The Price Is Right'' was taped on August 15, 2007, and his shows began airing on October 15, 2007. In response to replacing Barker as host of the game show, Carey stated "You can't replace Bob Barker. I don't compare myself to anybody... It's only about what you're doing and supposed to do, and I feel like I'm supposed to be doing this."&lt;ref name="ShowBuzz"&gt;{{cite news |agency=[[Associated Press]] |title=Drew Carey Finds Ms. Right |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/10/10/entertainment/main3354021.shtml |publisher=[[CBS News]] |date=October 12, 2007 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60E7O9FmS?url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/10/10/entertainment/main3354021.shtml |archivedate=July 16, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; When Carey began hosting, the set, theme music, and show logo were updated. However, Carey kept the old closing line about [[Neutering|spaying and neutering]] the pets that originated with Barker, although his version uses slightly different wording. During Carey's second year as host, he began to write some of the sketches used during the [[The Showcase|Showcase]], which sometimes features guest appearances by stars of other CBS programs. In the April Fools' Day 2013 episode, Carey and announcer [[George Gray (TV host)|George Gray]] switched places with the models, letting the two men be the models for the episode. On the April Fools' Day 2014 episode, Carey and Gray traded positions with [[Craig Ferguson]] (who was hosting ''[[The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson|The Late Late Show]]'' at the time) and [[Shadoe Stevens]], reprising their respective roles on Ferguson's show while Ferguson hosted and Stevens announced on ''Price''. On the first week of Season 46 (September 18-22, 2017), Carey celebrated his 10 years as host of the show, joining Barker as the only two to have hosted for at least a decade.

Carey began appearing in commercials for restaurants in the late 1990s in Canada with [[The Great Root Bear]], but his two-year contract with [[A&amp;W (Canada)|A&amp;W Food Services of Canada]] was cut short in November 1998 after [[The High Road to China|an episode]] of ''The Drew Carey Show'' featured [[McDonald's]].

When his video camera fails, the audience is left in complete darkness, wearing earphones, following his adventure through sound cues. The attraction is now closed.

Also in 1999, Carey appeared in [["Weird Al" Yankovic]]'s music video for his song [[It's All About the Pentiums|"It's All About The Pentiums".]] 

In 2000, Carey was given a cameo appearance in the ''[[The Sims: House Party|House Party]]'' expansion pack of the computer game ''[[The Sims]]''.&lt;ref name="HousePartySims"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Gaudiosi |first=John |title=Sims rocks in Drew Carey |work=Video Business |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-10997382_ITM |registration=yes |date=March 19, 2001 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090709035316/http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-10997382_ITM |archivedate=July 9, 2009 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; To make him appear, the characters in the game must throw a successful party, which causes Carey to arrive in a limo and join the festivities.

On January 21, 2001, Drew entered as [[Vince McMahon]]'s guest entrant in the [[Royal Rumble]] match.

Although primarily known for his television work, Carey has done limited film work, with his first appearance in 1993's ''Coneheads''. His next film was the 2000 [[television film]] ''[[Geppetto (TV musical)|Geppetto]]'', which debuted on [[Walt Disney anthology television series|''The Wonderful World of Disney'']].

On June 8, 2006, ''Drew Carey's Sporting Adventures'' debuted on the [[Travel Channel]].

On March 6, 2018, Carey appeared in an episode of ''[[NCIS (TV series)|NCIS]]'' as a retired Marine. His character was a sergeant, the last rank he held in real life; real pictures of him in dress blues and everyday garb were on the plasma screen in the squadroom.

==Writing==
Carey has routinely written throughout his career, including developing his stand-up comedy routines in his early stand-up career, and then moving on to assist in writing sitcoms. In 1997, Carey published his [[autobiography]], ''[[Dirty Jokes and Beer: Stories of the Unrefined]]'', wherein he shared memories of his early childhood and of his father's death when he was eight. He also revealed that he was once [[child sexual abuse|molested]], had suffered bouts of [[depression (mood)|depression]], and had made two [[suicide]] attempts by swallowing a large amount of sleeping pills.&lt;ref name=auto/&gt; The book discusses his [[Fraternities and sororities|college fraternity]] years while attending Kent State University and his professional career up to that time. The book featured large amounts of profanity and, as the title suggests, includes multiple dirty jokes (there is one at the start of each chapter) and references to beer, which was a departure from his on-screen persona. The book was featured on ''The New York Times'' bestseller list for three months.&lt;ref name="ABC.com"&gt;{{cite web|work=ABC.com|title=Personnel Files-Drew Carey|url=http://abc.go.com/primetime/drewcarey/bios/drew_carey.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060426200850/http://abc.go.com/primetime/drewcarey/bios/drew_carey.html|archivedate=April 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
He adopted his [[crew cut]] hairstyle while serving in the [[United States Marine Corps]]. Carey has had [[refractive surgery]] to correct his vision and therefore did not really require glasses (any glasses he wore in public were merely props to help the audience recognize him).&lt;ref name="EyeSurgery"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Clark|first=Doug|title=Operation Deserves Second Look|work=[[The Spokesman-Review]]|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SR&amp;p_theme=sr&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EAF44D9DBF00F2F&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|registration=yes|date=January 23, 2001|accessdate=July 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, while this was true for several years, on the May 17, 2006, episode of ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'' he revealed that when he turned 40, he actually developed a need for bifocals.

===Sports involvement===
Carey is a devoted fan of the [[United States men's national soccer team|U.S. National Soccer Team]], [[Cleveland Browns]], [[Cleveland Cavaliers]], [[Cleveland Indians]], and the [[Columbus Blue Jackets]]. In 1999, Carey was part of the pregame ceremonies at the first game of the return of the [[Cleveland Browns]], televised on [[ESPN]].&lt;ref name="ArtEnter"/&gt; Carey attended the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] in Germany and the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] in South Africa.

[[File:Drewcarey-brownsdedication.jpg|thumb|Carey preparing for a TV broadcast at the dedication of [[Cleveland Browns Stadium]], September 1999]]
Carey has shown his support for the Indians by throwing the first pitch at an August 12, 2006, game against the [[Kansas City Royals]]. He was rewarded by the Cleveland Indians for being "the greatest Indians fan alive" with a personal [[bobblehead doll]] made in his likeness that was given to fans. Carey responded to his bobblehead likeness by saying "Bobblehead Day, for me, is as big as getting a star in the Hollywood Walk of Fame."&lt;ref name="MLB.com"&gt;{{cite web|work=MLB.com|title=Indians 2006 Photo Gallery|url=http://www.mlb.com/cle/photogallery/year_2006/month_08/day_13/cf1608249.html|accessdate=July 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Carey was the first television actor to enter [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation's]] 30-man "[[Royal Rumble (2001)|Royal Rumble]]" match, which he did to promote an improv comedy [[pay-per-view]] at the time. He appeared in a few backstage segments before his brief participation in the match. Upon entering the ring, Carey stood unopposed for more than half a minute, but after the next entrant, [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]], refused a monetary bribe, Carey eliminated himself from the match by jumping over the top rope and retreating from ringside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tyra|first=Ty|work=[[The Tennessean]]|title=Test your Rumble knowledge|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/tennessean/access/1835600861.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jan+19%2C+2002&amp;author=&amp;pub=The+Tennessean&amp;desc=Test+your+Rumble+knowledge&amp;pqatl=google|format=Fee required|date=January 19, 2002|accessdate=July 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 2, 2011, Carey was inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] by Kane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Fishman |first=Scott |title=Show stops for HBK during WWE Hall of Fame ceremony |work=[[The Miami Herald]] |url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2011/04/03/2148288/show-stops-for-hbk-during-wwe.html |date=April 3, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60Fr2JHxp?url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2011/04/03/2148288/show-stops-for-hbk-during-wwe.html |archivedate=July 17, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carey competed against five other celebrities in the first celebrity edition of the 2003 [[World Poker Tour]]. He placed fifth, beating out only actor [[Jack Black]].

He is holding a camera with a long lens.|thumb|upright|Carey at the World Cup Fest in [[Kaiserslautern, Germany]], in June 2006, while filming ''Drew Carey's Sporting Adventures'']]
Carey is a supporter of libraries, crediting them for beginning his successful comedy career. On May 2, 2000, in a celebrity edition of ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire (US game show)|Who Wants to Be a Millionaire]]'', he selected the Ohio Library Foundation to receive his $500,000 winnings.&lt;ref name="MillionLibrary"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Bauder |first=David |publisher=[[CBS News]] |title=Fat Figures for Celebrity Millionaire |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2000/05/04/entertainment/main191844.shtml |date=May 4, 2000 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60EB9pDOV?url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2000/05/04/entertainment/main191844.shtml |archivedate=July 16, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He later went on to win an additional $32,000 on the second celebrity ''Millionaire'', making him one of the biggest winning contestants on ''Millionaire'' who did not win the top prize.

In October 2009, Carey made a bid of $25,000 in a charity auction for the @drew [[Twitter]] account. He later increased his offer to $100,000 if the number of followers of his account @DrewFromTV reached 100,000 by the end of the auction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Moore |first=Matthew |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/twitter/6258857/Drew-Carey-bids-100000-for-drew-Twitter-account-in-cancer-auction.html |title=Drew Carey bids $100,000 for @drew Twitter account in cancer auction |date=October 4, 2009 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60EBFWwgT?url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/twitter/6258857/Drew-Carey-bids-100000-for-drew-Twitter-account-in-cancer-auction.html |archivedate=July 16, 2011 |location=London |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with CBS News, he said he would instead donate $1 million to the charity [[Lance Armstrong Foundation|Livestrong Foundation]] if his follower count reached one million by December 31, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lazar |first=Shira |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2009/10/07/onthescene/entry5368580.shtml |title=Exclusive: Drew Carey Ups The Ante To $1 Million |publisher=[[CBS News]] |date=October 7, 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60EBRsAKZ?url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504464_162-5368580-504464.html |archivedate=July 16, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another of Carey's offers to contribute in helping others came in September 2014 when he promised $10,000 to help find the perpetrators of a faked "ice bucket challenge" involving an autistic 14-year-old Ohio boy who, instead of being doused in ice cubes and water, received a shower of feces, urine, tobacco spit, and cigarette butts.&lt;ref name="LATimes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/showtracker/la-et-st-drew-carey-als-ice-bucket-challenge-reward-ohio-20140907-story.html |title=Drew Carey offers $10,000 reward after alleged prank on autistic boy |last=Hamedy |first=Saba |date=September 7, 2014 |website=LATimes.com |publisher=Tribune Publishing |access-date=December 18, 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, celebrities [[Donnie Wahlberg]], [[Jenny McCarthy]] and [[Montel Williams]] matched Carey's offer.&lt;ref name="Salon"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.salon.com/2014/09/09/drew_carey_and_jenny_mccarthys_misguided_mission/ |title=Vigilante justice on the Internet: Drew Carey and Jenny McCarthy's dumb stunt |last=Williams |first=Mary Elizabeth |date=September 9, 2014 |website=Salon |publisher=Salon Media Group, Inc. |access-date=December 18, 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
