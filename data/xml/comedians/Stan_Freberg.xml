'''Stan Freberg''' (born '''Stanley &lt;!--- spelling is correct, born with "Friberg" instead of "Freberg", and with no middle name ---&gt;Friberg&lt;!--- spelling is correct, born with "Friberg" instead of "Freberg", and with no middle name ---&gt;'''; August 7, 1926 – April 7, 2015) was an American author, actor, recording artist, voice artist, comedian, radio personality, [[puppeteer]] and advertising creative director, whose career began in 1944. He remained active in the industry into his late 80s, more than 70 years after entering it.

His best-known works include "[[St. George and the Dragonet]]", ''[[Stan Freberg Presents the United States of America Volume One: The Early Years|Stan Freberg Presents the United States of America]]'', his role on the television series ''[[Time for Beany]]'', and a number of classic television commercials.

==Personal life==
Freberg was born Stanley &lt;!--- spelling is correct, born with "Friberg" instead of "Freberg"  and with no middle name ---&gt;Friberg&lt;!--- spelling is correct, born with "Friberg" instead of "Freberg", and with no middle name ---&gt;&lt;ref name=car1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.californiabirthindex.org/birth/stanley_friberg_born_1926_1027227 |title=Stanley Friberg, Born 08/07/1926 in California |publisher=CaliforniaBirthIndex.org |date=August 7, 1926 |accessdate=2014-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Pasadena, California]], the son of Evelyn Dorothy (née Conner), a housewife, and Victor Richard Friberg (later Freberg), a [[Baptist]] minister.  Freberg was a Christian and of Swedish and Irish descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-02-18/entertainment/ca-43621_1_stan-freberg |title=Stan Freberg, a Sage for the Masses, Returns to Public Eye |publisher=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=September 3, 2011 |first=Allan |last=Jalon |date=February 18, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Frankel |first=Mark |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20120238,00.html |title=Stan Freberg Pens a Memoir About His Strange Career Move—from Comedy to Commercials |publisher=People.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/73650091.html?dids=73650091:73650091&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Dec+14%2C+1988&amp;author=Jonathan+Yardley&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&amp;desc=Freberg%2C+Laughing+All+the+Way&amp;pqatl=google |title=Freberg, Laughing All the Way |publisher=Pqasb.pqarchiver.com |date=December 14, 1988 |accessdate=2014-01-05 |first=Jonathan |last=Yardley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freberg's work reflected both his gentle sensitivity (despite his liberal use of biting satire and [[parody]]) and his refusal to accept alcohol and tobacco manufacturers as sponsors—an impediment to his radio career when he took over for [[Jack Benny]] on [[Columbia Broadcasting System|CBS]] radio. As Freberg explained to Rusty Pipes:
{{quote|After I replaced Jack Benny in 1957, they were unable to sell me with spot announcements in the show. That would mean that every three minutes I'd have to drop a commercial in. So I said, "Forget it. I want to be sponsored by one person", like Benny was, by American Tobacco or State Farm Insurance, except that I wouldn't let them sell me to American Tobacco.  I refused to let them sell me to any cigarette company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cosmik.com/aa-october99/stan_freberg.html |title=An audience with Stan Freberg |publisher=Cosmik Debris |year=1999 |accessdate=February 8, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215231809/http://cosmik.com/aa-october99/stan_freberg.html |archivedate=February 15, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Freberg's first wife, Donna, died in 2000. He had two children from that marriage, Donna Jean and [[Donavan Freberg|Donavan]]. He married Betty Hunter in 2001.

==Animation==
Freberg was employed as a voice actor in animation shortly after graduating from [[Alhambra High School (Alhambra, California)|Alhambra High School]]. He began at Warner Brothers in 1944 by getting on a bus and asking the driver to let him off "in Hollywood".  As he describes in his autobiography, ''It Only Hurts When I Laugh'', he got off the bus and found a sign that said "talent agency".  He walked in, and the agents there arranged for him to audition for Warner Brothers cartoons where he was promptly hired.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Freberg|1988|pp=32–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His first notable cartoon voice work was in a Warner Brothers cartoon called ''For He's a Jolly Good Fala'', which was recorded but never filmed (due to the death of [[Fala (dog)|Fala]]'s owner, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]),{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} followed by ''Roughly Squeaking'' (1946) as Bertie; and in 1947, he was heard in ''It's a Grand Old Nag'' (Charlie Horse), produced and directed by [[Bob Clampett]] for [[Republic Pictures]];{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} ''[[Goofy Gophers|The Goofy Gophers]]'' (Tosh), and ''[[One Meat Brawl]]'' (Grover Groundhog and [[Walter Winchell]]).  He often found himself paired with [[Mel Blanc]] while at [[Warner Bros.]], where the two men performed such pairs as the mice [[Hubie and Bertie]] and [[Spike the Bulldog and Chester the Terrier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0292677/|title=Stan Freberg|website=IMDb.com|accessdate=October 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950, he was the voice of [[Friz Freleng]]'s "Dumb Dog" in "[[Foxy by Proxy]]", who meets up with a disguised Bugs Bunny wearing a fox suit. He was the voice of [[Pete Puma]] in the 1952 cartoon ''[[Rabbit's Kin]]'', in which he did an impression of an early [[Frank Fontaine]] characterization (which later became Fontaine's "Crazy Guggenheim" character).{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Freberg is often credited with voicing the character of Junyer Bear in ''[[Bugs Bunny and the Three Bears]]'' (1944), but that was actor [[Kent Rogers]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} After Rogers was killed during [[World War II]], Freberg assumed the role of Junyer Bear in [[Chuck Jones]]' [[Looney Tunes]] cartoon ''What's Brewin', Bruin?'' (1948), featuring [[Chuck Jones|Jones]]' version of [[The Three Bears (Looney Tunes)|The Three Bears]]. He also succeeded Rogers as the voice of [[Beaky Buzzard]].

Freberg was heard in many Warner Brothers cartoons, but his only{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} screen credit on one was ''[[Three Little Bops]]'' (1957). His work as a voice actor for [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Productions]] included the role of Mr. Busy the Beaver in ''[[Lady and the Tramp]]'' (1955) and did voice work in ''[[Susie the Little Blue Coupe]]'' and ''[[Lambert the Sheepish Lion]]''. Freberg also provided the voice of Sam, the orange cat paired with [[Sylvester the Cat|Sylvester]] in the Academy Award-nominated short ''[[Mouse and Garden]]'' (1960). He voiced Cage E. Coyote, the father of [[Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner|Wile E. Coyote]], in the 2000 short ''Little Go Beep''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xdn996_little-go-beep_shortfilms |title=Little Go Beep - Video Dailymotion |website=Dailymotion.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Films==
Freberg was cast to sing the part of the Jabberwock in the song "Beware the Jabberwock" for Disney's ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'', with the Rhythmaires and [[Daws Butler]]. Written by [[Don Raye]] and [[Gene de Paul]], the song was a musical rendering of the poem "[[Jabberwocky]]" from Lewis Carroll's ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]''. The song was not included in the final film, but a demo recording was included in the 2004 and 2010 DVD releases of the movie.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Freberg made his movie debut as an on-screen actor in the comedy ''[[Callaway Went Thataway]]'' (1951), a satirical spoof on the marketing of Western stars (apparently inspired by the TV success of [[Hopalong Cassidy]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}). Freberg costarred with [[Mala Powers]] in ''Geraldine'' (1953) as sobbing singer Billy Weber, enabling him to reprise his satire on vocalist [[Johnnie Ray]] (see below).{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}  In 1963's ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'', Freberg appeared in a non-speaking role as the Deputy Sheriff and acted as the voice of a dispatcher.

Contrary to popular belief [[George Lucas]] called upon Freberg, not [[Mel Blanc]], to audition for the voice of the character [[C-3PO]] for the 1977 film ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]''. After he and many others auditioned for the part, Freberg suggested that Lucas use mime actor [[Anthony Daniels]]' voice.&lt;ref name="Noel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harrisonline.com/audio/noelblanc.mp3 |title=Interview with Mel Blanc's son Noel |website=Harrisonline.com |accessdate=September 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Capitol Records==
===Early releases===
Freberg began making satirical recordings for [[Capitol Records]], beginning with the February 10, 1951, release of "John and Marsha", a soap opera parody that consisted of the title characters (both played by Freberg) doing nothing but repeating each other's names (with intonations to match the moods).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.povonline.com/freberg/Freberg01.htm |title=Stan Freberg |publisher=Mark Evanier |work=POVonline |accessdate=February 8, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219083738/http://www.povonline.com/freberg/Freberg01.htm |archivedate=February 19, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pc1&gt;{{cite web|url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19745/m1/ |title=Show 1 – Play A Simple Melody: American pop music in the early fifties. [Part 1&amp;#93; : UNT Digital Library |publisher=Digital.library.unt.edu |date= |accessdate=September 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some radio stations refused to play "John &amp; Marsha," believing it to be an actual romantic conversation between two real people. In a 1954 follow-up, he used [[pedal steel guitar]]ist [[Speedy West]] to satirize the 1953 [[Ferlin Husky]] country hit, "A Dear John Letter", as "A Dear John and Marsha Letter" (Capitol 2677).{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} A seasonal recording, "The Night Before Christmas"/"Nuttin' for Christmas", made in 1955, still remains a cult classic.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

With [[Daws Butler]] and [[June Foray]], Freberg produced his 1951 ''[[Dragnet (franchise)|Dragnet]]'' parody, "[[St. George and the Dragonet]]", a #1 hit for four weeks in October 1953.&lt;ref&gt;[[Number-one hits of 1953 (United States)]]&lt;/ref&gt; It sold over one million copies and was awarded a gold disc.&lt;ref name="The Book of Golden Discs"&gt;{{cite book

Another hit to receive the Freberg treatment was Johnnie Ray's weepy "[[Cry (Churchill Kohlman song)|Cry]]", which Freberg rendered as "Try" ("You too can be unhappy … if you try"), exaggerating Ray's histrionic vocal style.&lt;ref name=pc2&gt;{{Gilliland |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19746/m1/ |title=Show 2 – Play A Simple Melody: American pop music in the early fifties. [Part 2]: UNT Digital Library |publisher=Digital.library.unt.edu |date= |accessdate=September 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ray was furious until he realized the success of Freberg's 1952 parody was helping sales and [[airplay]] of his own record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mp3lyrics.org/s/stan-freberg/try/Rec |title=Notes about Try by Stan Freberg (note {3}) |accessdate=2012-01-03 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113135527/http://www.mp3lyrics.org/s/stan-freberg/try/Rec |archivedate=January 13, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Freberg reported getting more angry feedback for this than from his other parodies.&lt;ref name=pc2/&gt;

After "[[I've Got You Under My Skin]]" (1951), he followed with more popular musical satires, such as "[[Sh-Boom]]" (1954), a parody of the song recorded by [[The Chords (American band)|The Chords]]. At the end, he yells "STELLA!" at a woman, imitating [[Marlon Brando]] in ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (1951 film)|A Streetcar Named Desire]]''. The B side of that record was a parody of "[[C'est si bon]]", broadcast in 1955 on the TV show ''[[Sam and Friends]]''.&lt;ref name=CSB&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3297222/|title=C'est Si Bon|date=October 28, 2017|accessdate=October 28, 2017|website=IMDb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other songs include "[[The Yellow Rose of Texas (song)|The Yellow Rose of Texas]]" (1955),&lt;ref name=pc1/&gt; where a "Yankee" snare drummer gets out of hand on the recording; "[[Rock Island Line]]", based on the 1955 [[Lonnie Donegan]] skiffle version, with interruptions by [[Peter Leeds]]; and "[[The Great Pretender]]" (1956).

He recorded [[Elvis Presley]]'s first gold record, "[[Heartbreak Hotel]]"; in Freberg's version, the [[Echoplex|echo effect]] goes out of control, and Elvis eventually rips his jeans during the performance.&lt;ref name=pc7&gt;{{Gilliland |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19754/ |title=Show 7 – The All American Boy: Enter Elvis and the rock-a-billies. [Part 1] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With Foray, he recorded "The Quest for Bridey Hammerschlaugen", a spoof of ''[[The Search for Bridey Murphy]]'' by Morey Bernstein, a 1956 book on hypnotic regression to a past life and an LP of the first actual hypnosis session.

==="The Great Pretender" and "Banana Boat Song"===
Freberg used a [[beatnik]] musician theme in his 1956 parody of "[[The Great Pretender]]", the hit by [[The Platters]]—who, like Ray (see above) and Belafonte and Welk (see both below), were not pleased.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} At that time, when it was still hoped that musical standards might be preserved, it was quite permissible to ridicule the ludicrous, as Freberg had obviously thought when he parodied Presley. The pianist in Freberg's parody, a devotee of [[Erroll Garner]] and George Shearing, rebels against playing a single-chord accompaniment, retorting, "I'm not playing that 'clink-clink-clink jazz'!"  But Freberg is adamant about the pianist's sticking to The Platters' style: "You play that 'clink-clink-clink jazz', or you won't get paid tonight!" The pianist relents—sort of.&lt;ref name=pc5&gt;{{cite web|url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19751/m1/ |title=Show 5 – Hail, Hail, Rock 'n' Roll: The rock revolution gets underway. [Part 1&amp;#93; : UNT Digital Library |publisher=Digital.library.unt.edu |date=March 9, 1969 |accessdate=May 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pianist even quotes the first six notes from Shearing's classic piece "[[Lullaby of Birdland]]", before returning to the song.&lt;ref&gt;The parody was partly parodied when Mitchel Torok recorded "All Over Again, Again" for Columbia Records in mid-March 1959, but billed it as "The Great Pretender", as a spoof on the recent [[Sun Records]] recordings of [[Johnny Cash]]. Cash had only recently been signed to Columbia. The annoying pianist on the Freberg record was replaced by an equally annoying banjo player and a showboating guitarist on the Columbia release, a song written by Torok's wife who was then billed as "R. Redd" (Ramona Redd).&lt;/ref&gt; The song concludes with the piano accompaniment, despite the histrionic singer's pleas, becoming uncontrollably fast, and the singer having to escape the studio.

Freberg's "Banana Boat (Day-O)" (1957) satirized [[Harry Belafonte]]'s popular recording of "[[Day-O (The Banana Boat Song)|Banana Boat Song]]". In Freberg's version, the lead singer is forced to run down the hall and close the door after him to muffle the sound of his "Day-O!" because the beatnik bongo drummer, voiced by Leeds, complains, "It's too shrill, man. It's too piercing!" When he gets to the lyric about "A beautiful buncha ripe banana/Hide the deadly black tarantula," the drummer protests, "I don't dig spiders!"&lt;ref name=pc18&gt;{{cite web|url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19768/m1/ |title=Show 18 – Blowin' in the Wind: Pop discovers folk music. [Part 1&amp;#93; : UNT Digital Library |publisher=Digital.library.unt.edu |date=May 25, 1969 |work=[[Pop Chronicles]] |accessdate=September 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flip is "Tele-Vee-Shun", an anti-TV song about what television has done to his family, sung in a heavy faux-[[Trinidadian]] accent and set to a [[Calypso music|Calypso]] tune.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} Freberg first recorded the song in 1952, but the 1957 version is the most well known, which lampoons [[Elvis Presley]] in one verse: "I turn on Elvis Presley and my daughter scream. I fear she have a nervous breakdown cos of heem. I wonder why he wiggle-waggle to de beat. As a boy he must have had a loose bicycle seat."

Freberg's musical parodies were a by-product of his collaborations with [[Billy May]], a veteran [[big band music]]ian and [[jazz]] arranger, and his Capitol Records producer, Ken Nelson.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} Two weeks after [[Johnny Mathis]]' "[[Wonderful! Wonderful!]]" fell off from what became the Billboard Hot 100, "Wun'erful, Wun'erful! (Sides uh-one &amp; uh-two)", Freberg's 1957 spoof of TV "champagne music" master [[Lawrence Welk]], debuted. To replicate Welk's sound, May and some of Hollywood's finest [[studio musicians]] and vocalists worked to clone Welk's live on-air style, carefully incorporating bad notes and mistimed cues.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} Billy Liebert, a first-rate accordionist, copied Welk's [[accordion]] playing.

===Political satire===
Freberg also tackled political issues of the day. On his radio show, an extended sketch paralleled the [[Cold War]] [[brinkmanship]] between the U.S. and the [[Soviet Union]] by portraying an ever-escalating [[public relations]] battle between the El Sodom and the Rancho Gomorrah, two [[casino]]s in the city of Los Voraces (Spanish for "The Greedy Ones"—a thinly disguised [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]]). The sketch ends with the ultimate [[tourist attraction]], the [[Hydrogen Bomb]], which turns Los Voraces into a vast, barren wasteland. Network pressure forced Freberg to remove the reference to the hydrogen bomb and had the two cities being destroyed by an earthquake instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Freberg|1988|pp=108–114}}&lt;/ref&gt; The version of "Incident at Los Voraces", released later on Capitol Records, contains the original ending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dawsbutler.com/Freberg1.htm |title=The Stan Freberg Show: Episodes One Through Seven |publisher=Joe Bevilacqua and Lorie Kellogg |work=The Official Website of Daws Butler |date=July 2003 |accessdate=February 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freberg had poked fun at [[McCarthyism]] in passing in "Little Blue Riding Hood" with the line, "Only the color has been changed to prevent an investigation." Later, he blatantly parodied Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] with "Point of Order" (taken from his frequent objection).  The "suspect" being investigated was the black sheep from the nursery rhyme,"[[Baa, Baa, Black Sheep]]".  (Butler: "I would be suspicious of anyone who tried to rhyme '''dame''' with '''lane'''.")  Capitol's legal department was very nervous. Freberg describes being called in for a chat with Robert Karp, the department head, and being asked whether he had ever belonged to any group that might get attention from McCarthy. He replied, "I am, and have been for a long time, a card-carrying member of... "—the executive went pale—"... the Little Orphan Annie Fan Club of America." The executive retorted, "No, this is serious; this is not funny, Freberg. Stop making jokes!" A watered-down version of the parody was eventually aired, and Freberg never found himself "in front of a committee".&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, Barry and Freberg, Stan, ''Tip of the Freberg:  The Stan Freberg Collection 1951–1998'', {{ISBN|0-7379-0060-1}}, notes booklet, p. 12. Freberg wrote a slightly different version of this in ''It Only Hurts When I Laugh'' (p. 85), in which he was talking with Ken Nelson, whose final reaction was much more relaxed.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy===
On two occasions, Capitol refused to release Freberg's creations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Freberg|1988|pp=80–81}}&lt;/ref&gt; "That's Right, Arthur" was a barbed parody of controversial 1950s radio/TV personality [[Arthur Godfrey]], who expected his stable of performers—known as "little Godfreys"—to toady to him endlessly. The dialogue included Freberg's "Godfrey" monologue, punctuated by Butler imitating Godfrey announcer Tony Marvin, repeatedly interjecting, "That's right, Arthur!" between Godfrey's comments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bobclaster.com/#freberg |title=Bob Claster's Funny Stuff |quote=Arthur Godfrey satire |accessdate=February 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Capitol feared Godfrey might take [[lawsuit|legal action]] and sent a tape of the sketch to his legal department for permission, which was denied.  Capitol also rejected the equally acerbic "Most of the Town", a spoof of [[Ed Sullivan]]'s [[The Ed Sullivan Show|"The Toast of the Town"]], under the same circumstances.  Both recordings eventually surfaced on a [[box-set]] Freberg retrospective issued by [[Rhino Records]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Freberg continued to skewer the advertising industry after the demise of his show, producing and recording "[[Green Chri$tma$]]" in 1958, a scathing indictment of the over-commercialization of the holiday, in which Butler soberly hoped instead that we'd remember "Whose birthday we're celebrating". The satire ended abruptly with a rendition of "Jingle Bells" punctuated by cash register sounds. The original version was somewhat longer when it was first released in 1958, but in later years Capitol did not reissue the full recording.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}  Freberg also revisited the "Dragnet" theme, with "Yulenet", also known as "Christmas Dragnet", in which the strait-laced detective convinces a character named "Grudge" that Santa Claus really exists (and Columbus, Cleveland, Cincinnati, and the Easter Bunny, but Grudge still hadn't made up his mind yet about Toledo).  Butler does several voices on that record.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

===''Oregon! Oregon!''===
In 1958, the [[Oregon Centennial]] Commission, under the sponsorship of [[Blitz-Weinhard Brewing Company]], hired Freberg to create a musical to celebrate Oregon's one-hundredth birthday.&lt;ref name="npr"&gt;{{cite web

The result was ''Oregon! Oregon! A Centennial Fable in Three Acts.'' Recorded at Capitol in Hollywood, it was released during the Oregon Centennial in 1959 as a 12″ vinyl LP album. Side one featured two versions of an introduction by Freberg (billed as "Stan Freberg, Matinee Idol"), with the second version including a few words from the president of Blitz-Weinhard Co. This was followed by the show itself, which runs for 21 minutes. Side two includes separate individual versions of each of the featured songs, including several variations on the title piece, ''Oregon! Oregon!''

Fifty years later, as Oregon approached its Sesquicentennial, an updated version was prepared by Freberg and the Portland band [[Pink Martini]] as part of a signature series of performances throughout the state.&lt;ref name="npr"/&gt;&lt;ref name="shellac"/&gt; Pink Martini toured the state and performed four regional performances in the northern, southern and central areas of Oregon in August and September 2009. This was made possible by a grant from the Kinsman Foundation for a $40,000 launch of Pink Martini's ''Oregon! Oregon! 2009'' with Freberg.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

===1960s and later===
[[File:Stan Freberg leans on chair.jpg|thumb|Freberg in an early 60s publicity photo]]

In 1960, in the light of the [[payola]] scandal, Freberg made a two-sided single titled "The Old Payola Roll Blues", which tells the story of a corrupt recording studio promoter (voiced by [[Jesse White (actor)|Jesse White]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crazycollege.org/fweb.htm|title=An Interview with Stan Freberg|first=George|last=Stewart|year=1999|accessdate=March 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; find a teenager who cannot sing named "Clyde Ankle" (likely a take-off on Paul Anka). He records a song called "High School OO OO", which lasted only a few seconds.  (Noting this, Ankle asks, "Kind of a short song, isn't it?"  To which the producer answers, "Gets more airplay that way.")  The flip side was, "I Was on My Way to High School" (complete with fake audience noise from a "scream machine").  The promoter then tries to bribe a disc jockey at a jazz station to play the song on the air, which he flatly refuses, suspecting that the promoter was never in the music business in the first place.  Afterward, a song in the big band style heralds the end of rock and roll and a resurgence of swing and jazz.  Freberg's record was on the Hot 100 only the week of Leap Day 1960, at #99, about three and a half months after [[Tommy Facenda]]'s multi-versioned "High School U.S.A." peaked at #28. [[Alan Freed]], whose career fell prey to charges of payola, reportedly laughed at Freberg's interpretation of the scandal.

''[[Stan Freberg Presents The United States of America Volume One The Early Years|Stan Freberg Presents the United States of America, Volume One: The Early Years]]'' (1961) combined dialogue and song in a musical theatre format. The original [[album musical]], released on Capitol, parodies the history of the United States from 1492 until the end of the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] in 1783.  In it, Freberg parodied both large and small aspects of history. For instance, in the Colonial era, it was common to use the [[long s]], which resembles a lowercase f, in the middle of words; thus, as Ben Franklin is reading the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], he questions the passage, "Life, liberty, and the ''purfuit of happineff?!?''" Most of that particular sketch is a satire of McCarthyism. For example, Franklin remarks, "You...sign a harmless petition, and forget all about it. Ten years later, you get hauled up before a committee."

The album also featured the following exchange, where Freberg's [[Christopher Columbus]] is "discovered on beach here" by a [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] played by [[Marvin Miller (actor)|Marvin Miller]]. Skeptical of the Natives' diet of corn and "other organically grown vegetables", Columbus wants to open "America's first Italian restaurant" and needs to cash a check to get started:
{{quote|
Native:  "You out of luck, today. Banks closed."&lt;br /&gt;
Columbus:  [archly, knowing what the response will be] "Oh? ''Why''?"&lt;br /&gt;
Native:  "Columbus Day!"&lt;br /&gt;
Columbus:  [pregnant pause] "We going out on that joke?"&lt;br /&gt;
Native:  "No, we do reprise of song. That help&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;br /&gt;
Columbus and Native together:  "But not much, no!"
}}

''Stan Freberg Presents The United States of America, Volume Two'' was planned for release during America's [[United States Bicentennial|Bicentennial]] in 1976, but it did not emerge until 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyberonic.net/~atrain/comedy/freberg.htm |title=Stan Freberg Discography |publisher=Warren Debenham, Norm Katuna |date=February 2008 |accessdate=February 8, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615154511/http://www.library.unt.edu/music/special-collections/john-gilliland/e-l |archivedate=June 15, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freberg's early parodies revealed his obvious love of jazz.  His portrayals of jazz musicians were usually stereotypical "[[beatnik]]" types, but jazz was always portrayed as preferable to [[popular music|pop]], [[Calypso music|calypso]], and particularly the then-new form of music, [[rock and roll]].  He whopped doo-wop in his version of "[[Sh-Boom]]" and lampooned [[Elvis Presley]] with an echo/reverb rendition of "[[Heartbreak Hotel]]".&lt;ref name=pc7/&gt;  ''The United States of America'' includes a sketch involving the musicians in the painting ''[[Archibald MacNeal Willard#The Spirit of '76|The Spirit of '76]]''.  The terribly hip fife player ("Bix", played by Freberg) and the younger drummer (played by [[Walter Tetley]]) argue with the older, impossibly square drummer ("Doodle", also voiced by Freberg) over how "[[Yankee Doodle]]" should be performed.

== Radio ==
[[File:Stan Freberg and Gong.jpg|thumb|left|Theater for the ear: Freberg strikes a pose, 1962]]

The popularity of Freberg's recordings landed him his own program, the situation comedy ''That's Rich''. Freberg portrayed bumbling but cynical Richard E. Wilt, a resident of Hope Springs, where he worked for B.B. Hackett's Consolidated Paper Products Company. Freberg suggested the addition of dream sequences, which made it possible for him to perform his more popular Capitol Records satires before a live studio audience. The [[CBS]] series aired from January 8 to September 23, 1954.

''[[The Stan Freberg Show]]'' was a 1957 replacement for Jack Benny on CBS radio. The satirical show, which featured elaborate production, included most of the team he used on his Capitol recordings, including Foray, Leeds, and Butler.  Billy May arranged and conducted the music. The Jud Conlon Singers, who had also appeared on Freberg recordings, were regulars, as was singer Peggy Taylor, who had participated in his "Wun'erful, Wun'erful!" record.  The show was produced by Pete Barnum.

The show failed to attract a sponsor after Freberg decided he did not want to be associated with the tobacco companies that had sponsored Benny.  In lieu of actual commercials, Freberg mocked advertising by touting such products as "Puffed Grass" ("It's good for Bossie, it's good for me and you!"), "Food" ("Put some food in your tummy-tum-tum!"), and himself ("Stan Freberg—the foaming comedian! Bobba-bobba-bom-bom-bom"), a parody of the well-known [[Ajax (cleanser)|Ajax cleanser]] commercial.

The lack of sponsorship was not the only issue.  Freberg frequently complained of radio network interference.  Another sketch from the CBS show, "Elderly Man River", anticipated the [[political correctness]] movement by decades.  Butler plays "Mr. Tweedly", a representative of a fictional citizens' radio review board, who constantly interrupts Freberg with a loud buzzer as Freberg attempts to sing "[[Ol' Man River|Old Man River]]". Tweedly objects first to the word "old",  "which some of our more ''elderly'' citizens find distasteful". As a result, the song's lyrics are progressively and painfully distorted as Freberg struggles to turn the classic song into a form that Tweedly will find acceptable "to the tiny tots" listening at home:  "He don't, er,  ''doesn't'' plant 'taters, er, ''potatoes''… he doesn't plant cotton, er, ''cotting''… and them-these-those that plants them are soon ''forgotting''", a lyric of which Freberg is particularly proud.  Even when the censor finds Freberg's machinations acceptable, the constant interruption ultimately brings the song to a grinding halt (just before Freberg would have had to edit the line "You gets a little drunk and you lands in jail"), saying, "Take your finger off the button, Mr. Tweedly—we know when we're licked", furnishing the moral and the punch line of the sketch at once.  But all of these factors forced the cancellation of the show after a run of only 15 episodes.

In 1966, he recorded an album, ''Freberg Underground'', in a format similar to his radio show, using the same cast and orchestra. He called it "pay radio",  in a parallel to the phrase [[pay TV]] (the nickname at the time for subscription-based cable and broadcast television) "…because you have to go into the record store and buy it". This album is notable for giving Dr. [[Edward Teller]] the ''Father of the Year'' award for being "father of the [[hydrogen bomb]]" ("Use it in good health!"); for a combined satire of the ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' television series and the 1966 California Governor's race between [[Pat Brown|Edmund G. "Pat" Brown]] and [[Ronald Reagan]]; and probably most famous for a bit in which, through the magic of [[sound effects]], Freberg drained [[Lake Michigan]] and refilled it with [[hot chocolate]] and a mountain of [[whipped cream]] while a giant [[maraschino cherry]] was dropped like a bomb by the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] to the cheers of 25,000 extras viewing from the shoreline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freberg concluded with, "Let's see them do that on television!" That bit became a commercial for advertising on radio.

Freberg returned to radio in several episodes of [[The Twilight Zone]] Radio Dramas in the early 2000s, including "The Brain Center at Whipple's," "Four O'Clock," "The Fugitive," "Gentlemen, Be Seated," "Kick the Can," "The Masks," and "Static."

Beginning in 1949, Freberg and Butler provided voices and were the [[puppeteer]]s for [[Bob Clampett]]'s [[puppet]] series, ''[[Time for Beany]]'', a triple [[Emmy Award]] winner (1950, 1951, 1953).

In 1996, he portrayed the continuing character of Mr. Parkin on ''Roseanne'',{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} and both Freberg and his son had roles in the short-lived ''[[Weird Al Show]]'' in 1997.

=== Advertising ===
When Freberg introduced satire to the field of advertising, he revolutionized the industry, influencing staid ad agencies to imitate Freberg by injecting humor into their previously dead-serious commercials. Freberg's long list of successful ad campaigns includes:
* Butternut coffee: A nine-minute musical, "Omaha!",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reelradio.com/gifts/omaha.html |title=REELRADIO Golden Gift – ButterNut Coffee Presents Omaha Starring Stan Freberg |publisher=Reelradio.com |date= |accessdate=May 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which actually found success outside advertising as a musical production in the city of [[Omaha]]. It tells the story of a young man, "Eustace K. Butternut", who was stolen by Gypsies at an early age and, as an adult, returns to his own city, finding the residents under a spell that keeps them singing and raising their arms in the air. He frees them by saying his last name backwards ("Tunrettub"), but he immediately orders them to raise their hands back up again, taking everything the citizens have.
* [[Contadina]] [[tomato paste]]: "Who put eight great tomatoes in that little bitty can?"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Freberg|1988|pp=96–98}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Totino's|Jeno's]] pizza rolls:  A parody of the [[Lark (cigarette)|Lark]] cigarettes commercial that used the [[William Tell (opera)|William Tell Overture]] and a pick-up truck with a sign in the bed saying "Show us your Lark pack", here ending with a confrontation between a cigarette smoker, portrayed by [[Barney Phillips]] (supposedly representing the Lark commercial's announcer) and [[Clayton Moore]] as the [[Lone Ranger]] over the use of the music. [[Jay Silverheels]] also appears as [[Tonto]], filling his possibles bag with pizza rolls, after asking "Have a Pizza Roll, kemo sabe?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE-NdrzfFOo |title=YouTube – Jeno's Pizza Rolls Commercial |publisher=Youtube.com |date=June 17, 2006 |accessdate=September 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was regarded as one of the most brilliantly conceived and executed TV ads of the period; after one showing on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'', [[Johnny Carson]] remarked that it was the first commercial he had ever seen to receive spontaneous applause from the studio audience.
* Jeno's pizza, in a parody of [[Scope (mouthwash)|Scope]] mouthwash commercials.  "You know why nobody likes your parties, Mary?  You have bad pizza—''bad pizza''!"{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}
* Sunsweet pitted [[prune (fruit)|prunes]]: Depicted as the "food of the future" in a [[futuristic]] setting, until science fiction icon [[Ray Bradbury]], a friend of Freberg's (shown on a wall-to-wall television screen reminiscent of [[Fahrenheit 451]]) butts in: "I never mentioned prunes in any of my stories."  "You didn't?"  "No, never.  I'm sorry to be so candid." "No, they're not candied" ([[rim shot]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5NxG_rr5aU |title=YouTube – Ray Bradbury Prunes Commercial |publisher=Youtube.com |date=December 13, 2007 |accessdate=September 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bradbury reportedly refused to consider doing a commercial until Freberg told him, "I'm calling it ''Brave New Prune''", prompting Bradbury to ask, "When do we start?"  Prune sales increased 400 percent the year following the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://foxpudding.wordpress.com/2012/10/18/stan-freberg/|title=Stan Freberg|work=The Automat|accessdate=October 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Heinz (company)|Heinz]] Great American Soups: [[Ann Miller]] is a housewife who turns her kitchen into a gigantic production number, singing such lyrics as "Let's face the chicken gumbo and dance!"  After watching his wife's flashy tap dancing, her husband, played by veteran character actor [[Dave Willock]], asks, "Why do you always have to make such a big production out of everything?"  At the time (1970), this was the most expensive commercial ever made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oS99Z2-qe3sC&amp;pg=PA76&amp;lpg=PA76&amp;dq=%22great+american+soup%22+%22most+expensive%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=tyMaNSetjn&amp;sig=yImASw5E5u856zbSb98qBPy6N6g&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=nIeLU-mmGsKhogSjoYKICQ&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22great%20american%20soup%22%20%22most%20expensive%22&amp;f=false |title=H.J.

* [[Kaiser Aluminum]] produced foil, to rival [[Reynolds Wrap]]. Freberg created a sales campaign based on Kaiser's difficulties in getting grocers to stock their product, featuring the "Kaiser Foil Salesman". Despite the company's initial hesitation, the campaign produced a huge increase in distribution and sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Freberg|1988|pp=154–173}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cartoonresearch.com/index.php/kaiser-foil-grabbers/|title=Foiled Again!

Today, these advertisements are considered classics by many critics.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}  Though [[Bob &amp; Ray]] had pioneered intentionally comic advertisements (stemming from a hugely successful campaign for Piels beer), Stan Freberg is usually credited as being the first person to introduce humor into television advertising with memorable campaigns. He felt a truly funny commercial would cause consumers to request a product, as was the case with his elaborate ad campaign that prompted stores to stock Salada tea.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} [[Jeno Paulucci]], then the owner of Chun King, had to pay off a bet over the success of Freberg's first commercial by pulling Freberg in a [[Pulled rickshaw|rickshaw]] on Hollywood's La Cienega Boulevard.&lt;ref name="Freberg 1988 183"/&gt; Freberg won 21 [[Clio award]]s for his commercials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://emmys.tv/media/releases/2006/rel_laarea_gov.php |title=2006 Los Angeles Area Governors Award Honor to Television Pioneer Stan Freberg |date=June 22, 2006 |publisher=Academy of Television Arts &amp;amp; Sciences |accessdate=February 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of those spots were included in the Freberg four-CD [[box set]] ''Tip of the Freberg''.

Following his success in comedy records and television, Freberg was often invited to appear as a featured guest at various events, such as his skit at the 1978 Science Fiction Film Awards, again playing straight man to Orville in his [[UFO]]. He innocently asks why there is a hole in the end of the spacecraft, only to be told, "That's where the swamp gas comes out."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrSRU3uXPmw The Science Fiction Film Awards], The Museum of Classic Chicago Television, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

He had brief sketches on [[KNX (AM)]] radio in the mid-1990s, beginning each with "Freberg here!"  In one sketch, Freberg mentioned that the band played "Inhale to the Chief" at [[Bill Clinton]]'s inauguration.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

He guest starred multiple times on ''[[Garfield and Friends]]'' and The Garfield Show, where he provided the voice of Dr. Whipple, and as the studio chairman on an episode of ''[[Taz-Mania]]''.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Freberg was inducted into the [[National Radio Hall of Fame]] in 1995. From 1995 until October 6, 2006, Freberg hosted ''[[When Radio Was]]'', a [[radio syndication|syndicated]] anthology of vintage radio shows.&lt;ref name="deathcause"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/news/stan-freberg-comedian-satirist-dies-dead-1201467899/|title=Comedian and Voice Actor Stan Freberg Dies at 88|publisher=Variety.com|accessdate=April 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The release of the 1996 Rhino CD ''The United States of America Volume 1 (the Early Years)'' and ''Volume 2 (the Middle Years)'' suggested a possible third volume (which never happened). This set includes some parts written but cut because they would not fit on a record album.

He appeared on [["Weird Al" Yankovic]]'s ''[[The Weird Al Show]]'', playing both the J.B. Toppersmith character and the voice of the puppet Papa Boolie. Yankovic has acknowledged Freberg as one of his greatest influences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Yankovic |first=Al |url=https://variety.com/2014/scene/spotlight/al-yankovic-stan-freberg-1201340095/ |title=‘Weird Al’ Yankovic Salutes His Hero, Stan Freberg |publisher=Variety.com |date=October 30, 2014 |accessdate=February 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freberg is among the commentators in the special features on the multiple-volume DVD sets of the ''[[Looney Tunes Golden Collection]]'' and narrates the documentary "Irreverent Imagination" on Volume 1.

Freberg was the announcer for the boat race in the movie version of ''[[Stuart Little (film)|Stuart Little]]'', and in 2008 he guest starred as [[Sherlock Holmes]] in two episodes of ''[[The Radio Adventures of Dr. Floyd]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.doctorfloyd.com/2008/10/12/stan-freberg-to-appear-on-dr-floyd/ |title=The Radio Adventures of Dr. Floyd |publisher=The Radio Adventures of Dr. Floyd |date=October 12, 2008 |quote=Stan Freberg To Star on the Radio Adventures of Dr. Floyd Podcast |accessdate=February 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2008 onwards Freberg voiced numerous characters, including Doctor Whipple and Fluffykins, on ''[[The Garfield Show]]''. He recorded his last voice-over role for the episode "Rodent Rebellion" in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsfromme.com/2016/10/22/garfield-news/|title=Garfield News - News From ME|date=October 22, 2016|website=Newsfromme.com|accessdate=October 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The 1968 film ''[[The Acid Eaters]]'' has a John and Marsha exchange. Marsha is played by Dianne Curtis.

'''Recordings'''
* In 2007, comedian [[Luke Ski|the great Luke Ski]] recorded a 10-minute homage called ''MC Freberg'', a parody illustrating what a Freberg-type satire of [[rap music]] would have sounded like.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lyricsmania.com/mc_freberg_lyrics_great_luke_ski_the.html |title=The great Luke Ski - MC Freberg Lyrics |publisher=Lyricsmania.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally recorded for ''The FuMP'', the track also appears on Ski's album ''BACONspiracy''.

'''Television'''
* In Season One, Episode Three of ''[[The Monkees (TV series)|The Monkees]]'', which aired on 26 September 1966, Freberg appeared as evil toy marketer Mr. Daggart, who favors new, technology-minded toys instead of old, hand-made toys, and is quickly shown up by the four Monkees.
* On the fourth-season premiere of the TV series ''[[Mad Men]]'', [[Peggy Olson]] ([[Elisabeth Moss]]) and Joey Baird ([[Matt Long]]) act out the "John and Marsha" comedy soap opera parody and repeatedly call each other John and Marsha.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Boston Globe|title=Mad about 'John &amp; Marsha'|author=Don Aucoin, Globe Staff |date= July 31, 2010|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/tv/articles/2010/07/31/mad_about_john__marsha/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
