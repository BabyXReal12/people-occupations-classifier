As a stand-up comedian, Ansari released his debut comedy special, ''[[Intimate Moments for a Sensual Evening]]'', in January 2010 on Comedy Central Records, and tours nationally between acting commitments.

[[File:Human-giant.jpg|thumb|left|From left to right, ''Human Giant''{{'}}s Aziz Ansari, [[Rob Huebel]], [[Jason Woliner]], and [[Paul Scheer]] in May 2007]]
Around the summer of 2005, Ansari began collaborating with fellow comedians [[Rob Huebel]] and [[Paul Scheer]] (both from the improv troupe [[Respecto Montalban]]), as well as director [[Jason Woliner]] to make short films. The first series created by the group was ''Shutterbugs'', which followed Huebel and Ansari as cutthroat child talent agents. This was followed up by the ''Illusionators'', which starred Ansari and Scheer as [[Criss Angel]]–style [[Goth subculture|goth]] magicians. In mid-2006, MTV greenlit a sketch series from the group, which debuted April 5, 2007. The show ran for two seasons and the group was offered a third season, but they opted to pursue other opportunities.

In 2009, Ansari appeared in the [[Judd Apatow]] film ''[[Funny People]]''. Apatow liked Ansari's character, "Randy", and commissioned him and ''[[Human Giant]]'' collaborator [[Jason Woliner]] to create online shorts centered around his character, to promote the film. These shorts proved successful and the character became the subject of one of the film ideas Ansari and Woliner are developing for [[Apatow Productions]].

===Stand-up comedy===

Amongst various acting commitments, Ansari has continued performing and touring as a stand-up comedian. In 2006 and 2007, he toured with the [[Comedians of Comedy]] and [[Flight of the Conchords]]. In late 2008 and early 2009, Ansari headlined his own comedy tour, the Glow in the Dark Tour. The material on this tour became the basis for a DVD/CD special for [[Comedy Central]]. The set, titled ''[[Intimate Moments for a Sensual Evening]]'', aired January 17, 2010, with a CD/LP/DVD release on January 19.&lt;ref name="pitchfork"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://pitchfork.com/news/37085-aziz-ansari-preps-stand-up-album/ |title=Aziz Ansari Preps Stand-Up Album | publisher = [[Pitchfork Media]] |last = Breihan | first = Tom | date = November 12, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ansari's comedy style tends to focus on aspects of his personal life. "I like talking about things that are going on in my life, because that's always going to be different and original", he says. "No one else is gonna be talking about my personal experiences".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | url = http://venuszine.com/articles/art_and_culture/culture/2046/Aziz_Ansar| deadurl = yes| title = Aziz Ansari| last = Drea | first = Amber | date = June 1, 2006| magazine = [[Venus Zine]] | issue = 28i | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120331100219/http://venuszine.com/articles/art_and_culture/culture/2046/Aziz_Ansari| archivedate = March 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2010, Ansari began a new tour, ''Dangerously Delicious'', which was in theaters across the United States; stops included the [[Bonnaroo Music Festival]] and [[Carnegie Hall]] in New York City. The tour wrapped with a filming for a special, ''[[Dangerously Delicious]]'' at the [[Warner Theatre (Washington, D.C.)|Warner Theatre]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], in June 2011. This special was released on his website in March 2012 for download or stream.&lt;ref name="GQ"&gt;{{cite magazine | url = https://www.gq.com/entertainment/tv/blogs/the-stream/2012/03/aziz-ansari-dangerously-delicious-standup-online.html| title =The GQ&amp;A: Aziz Ansari on His New, Web-Only Comedy Special, Hearing From R.

In March 2012, Ansari announced a new tour entitled "Buried Alive", with dates scheduled for Q2/Q3 2012.&lt;ref name="GQ" /&gt; A third stand-up special, ''[[Aziz Ansari: Buried Alive]]'', was filmed during the tour at the [[Merriam Theater]] in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], and premiered on [[Netflix]] on November 1, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Respers France|first=Lisa|title=Aziz Ansari gets 'Buried Alive'|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/10/31/showbiz/celebrity-news-gossip/aziz-ansari-comedy-special-netflix/|work=[[CNN]]|publisher=Cable News Network, Inc.|accessdate=November 4, 2013|date=October 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His 2015 special, ''[[Aziz Ansari: Live at Madison Square Garden]]'', also premiered on Netflix.

===Writing===

Ansari's book, ''[[Modern Romance: An Investigation]]'', was released on June 16, 2015. The book is about the comedic pitfalls of dating in the modern world and was written with sociologist [[Eric Klinenberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aziz (Modern Romance) Ansari|url=http://book.azizansari.com/|publisher=AzizAnsari.com|accessdate=April 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charity work===
In 2012, Ansari played a talking goat in an animated video for [[Oxfam America]] to encourage donations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfamamericaunwrapped.com/aziz Oxfam America Unwrapped: "Be a goat with Aziz Ansari"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121212062121/http://www.oxfamamericaunwrapped.com/aziz |date=December 12, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Boston Marathon bombing]] in 2013, Ansari performed a benefit for the victims at the [[Wilbur Theater]] in Boston, Massachusetts. All ticket proceeds benefited The One Fund &amp; The Officer Richard Donohue Fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lenalamoray.com/2013/04/23/aziz-ansari-performing-at-the-wilbur-in-boston-on-sunday-to-benefit-the-one-fund-and-the-officer-richard-donohue-fund/|title=Aziz Ansari performing at The Wilbur in Boston on Sunday to benefit The One Fund and The Officer Richard Donohue Fund|work=lenalamoray.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Ansari described himself as "[[Irreligious|not religious]]" on [[Twitter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/azizansari/status/554477655714574336|title=To be clear, I am not religious and have nothing against Christians or Muslims, just ignorance like what @rupertmurdoch is spreading.|first=Aziz|last=Ansari|date=January 11, 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was raised as a [[Muslim]] by his parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2017/05/17/master-of-none-aziz-ansari-muslim/101693552/|title='Master of None': Aziz Ansari opens up about his Muslim upbringing|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ansari was in a relationship with professional chef Courtney McBroom from 2014 to January 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mcrady|first=Rachel|title=Aziz Ansari Dating Courtney McBroom: Exclusive Details|url=http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/aziz-ansari-dating-courtney-mcbroom-exclusive-details-2014178|work=[[Us Weekly]]|accessdate=September 25, 2014|date=August 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shepherd|first1=Julianne Escobedo|title=Aziz Ansari's New Girlfriend Turned Him Into a Feminist|url=http://jezebel.com/aziz-ansaris-new-girlfriend-turned-him-into-a-feminist-1643321094|accessdate=April 10, 2015|work=Jezebel|date=October 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/confidential/aziz-ansari-girlfriend-break-years-article-1.2503931|title=Aziz Ansari and girlfriend break up after two years|access-date=July 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has self-identified as a [[feminist]], saying his girlfriend has helped influence him. Ansari also incorporated an episode about feminism titled "Ladies and Gentlemen" in ''Master of None''. In an interview in 2015, he spoke about the episode's meaningfulness to him saying "I thought it was interesting that this is happening, yet so many people are unaware of it. And the problem is people aren't talking about it. What I've learned, as a guy, is to just ask women questions and listen to what they have to say. Go to your group of female friends and ask them about times they've experienced sexism at their job, and you'll get blown away by the things they tell you."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/louis-cks-powerful-army-of-celebrity-enablers|title=Louis C.K.'s Powerful Army of Celebrity Enablers|work=The Daily Beast}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2014/10/07/aziz_ansari_embraces_feminism_on_the_late_show_with_david_letterman.html|title=Aziz Ansari embraces feminism on the Late Show with David Letterman.|work=Slate Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plaques have their faces engraved along with the words: "The Food Club has dined here and deemed it plaque-worthy". He explained to ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', "It's a really serious-looking plaque and all of the restaurants we've given it to have put it front and center. It's funny because people will walk into a restaurant and be like, 'What the fuck is the Food Club?
