'''Thomas James Ridgewell''' (born 27 June 1990),&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/apr/07/youtube-uk-20-online-video-bloggers|title=YouTube UK: 20 of Britain's most popular online video bloggers|last=Fox|first=Killian|last2=Lewis|first2=Tim|date=2013-04-06|website=the Guardian|access-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; known online as '''TomSka''', is an English [[YouTube celebrity]], writer, producer, director, actor, and filmmaker, as well as founder of the Turbopunch Ltd. media production company. He is known for his animated comedy web film series ''asdfmovie''{{efn|"asdf" pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|z|d|ə|f}}}} and webtoons ''[[Eddsworld]]'' and ''Crash Zoom''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thevideoink.com/features/comedies-tomska-wants-better-youtube-fans/|title=Between Comedies, TomSka Also Educates His YouTube Fans - VideoInk|date=2014-08-17|website=VideoInk|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of July 2018, his YouTube channel has over 5.1 million subscribers and his videos have garnered over 1.1 billion views.

==Early life and education==
As a child, Ridgewell began making short films using his parents' video camera. Not long after YouTube was established, Ridgewell created CakeBomb, a website which he posted his video creations, including his viral animated video series ''asdfmovie'' and his friend [[Edd Gould]]'s ''Eddsworld''. Ridgewell graduated from [[University of Lincoln]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lincolnshireecho.co.uk/University-Lincoln-students-guest-present-Radio-1/story-22836679-detail/story.html|title=Former University of Lincoln students to guest present on Radio 1|date=2014-08-27|website=Lincolnshire Echo|access-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;, where he created a series of unofficial "advertisements" for the university which received millions of views.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.brandrepublic.com/news/1085410|title=Appointment to view: The University of Lincoln goes viral|website=www.brandrepublic.com|access-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was raised a [[Jehovah's Witness]], but no longer practices this faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=DarkSquidge|title=The Day My Faith Died|date=2015-10-07|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXRK76x_D8Q|accessdate=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, he has expressed a belief in a god.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=DarkSquidge|title=7 Facts About TomSka|date=2013-01-28|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZ2wwLh1dhU|accessdate=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==YouTube career==
As a professional YouTuber, Ridgewell earns money from revenue from his videos on the website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/london-life/the-tom-ridgewell-show-the-22yearold-making-10000-a-month-from-his-bedroom-on-youtube-8530893.html|title=The Tom Ridgewell show: the 22-year-old making £10,000 a month from his bedroom on YouTube|date=2013-03-12|website=Evening Standard|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also has made short films for [[BBC]] and [[Comedy Central]]. He has been discussed and interviewed in relation to this, especially when the medium of online video was in its infancy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/13136416|title=YouTube star TomSka 'makes thousands' every month|last=reporter|first=Dan WhitworthNewsbeat technology|access-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also appeared as a guest on the BBC's ''[[The One Show]]'', and has appeared as a radio and TV guest internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=thepod96|title=TomSka and Bing on The One Show - BBC One|date=2011-11-23|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-hLCjzjOvs|accessdate=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Ridgewell released the first installment of ''asdfmovie'', an animated sketch comedy series featuring very short clips of minimally-detailed characters in [[Surreal humour|surreal]] and occasionally [[Black comedy|darkly humorous]] situations. There have been ten episodes as of April 2017, as well as two "deleted scene" videos, a promotional video with [[Marmite]], and four music videos; "I Like Trains", "Mine Turtle", "Everybody Do The Flop", and "The Muffin Song".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=TomSka|title=asdfmovie10|date=2017-04-01|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foFKXS6Nyho|accessdate=2017-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song "Beep Beep I'm a Sheep" by Canadian musician Todd "LilDeuceDeuce" Bryanton with vocals by Ridgewell and Gabriel "BlackGryph0n" Brown, released alongside ''asdfmovie10'', was featured in the dance [[rhythm game]] ''[[Just Dance 2018]]''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.destructoid.com/random-time-beep-beep-like-a-sheep-in-just-dance-2018-456534.phtml&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Ridgewell founded a media production company, TurboPunch Ltd., located in London. Ridgewell currently works there alongside co-writer Eddie Bowley and video editor Elliot Gough.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.datalog.co.uk/browse/detail.php/CompanyNumber/07912863/CompanyName/TURBOPUNCH+LIMITED&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2012, he took charge of the production of ''Eddsworld'' after the show's original creator, [[Edd Gould]], died of [[Acute lymphoblastic leukemia|leukemia]]. He left the series in 2016, handing the show over to Edd's family. In 2013, Ridgewell was featured in YouTube's first "Comedy Week".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/comedy/comedy-news/10068492/YouTubes-Comedy-Week-shows-how-much-comedy-has-changed.html|title=YouTube's Comedy Week shows how much comedy has changed|website=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was featured on the cover of [[Wired UK]] in February 2013 as part of a feature titled "How YouTube Reinvented the Entertainment Business"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2013/02/features/talent-tube|title=Talent Tube: how Britain's new YouTube superstars built a global fanbase|website=WIRED UK|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was selected by YouTube as a guest host for its Geek Week series in August. The BBC announced that Ridgewell will be appearing as a guest presenter on the ''[[Dan and Phil]]'' show from September 2014 on BBC Radio 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2014/r1-youth-presenters|title=BBC - New youth presenters for Radio 1 - Media Centre|website=www.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/apr/07/youtube-superstars-new-generation-bloggers|title=YouTube superstars: the generation taking on TV – and winning|last=Lewis|first=Tim|date=2013-04-06|website=the Guardian|access-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/tv-radio/radio-1-to-hire-youtubefamous-vloggers-to-broadcast-online-9686208.html|title=Radio 1 to hire 'YouTube-famous' vloggers to broadcast online|date=2014-08-22|website=The Independent|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015, Ridgewell launched a new webtoon, ''Crash Zoom'', on his TomSka channel. It is animated by Ben "Wonchop" Smallman, who also animated some of the ''asdfmovie'' episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=DarkSquidge|title=I'M NOT AN ANIMATOR|date=2015-06-26|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcrsyXyd34A|accessdate=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It features three young characters, Lucy, Ben, and Kate, in their various surreal exploits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=TomSka|title=CRASH ZOOM - Movie Massacre|date=2015-01-09|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnyBXvB3_ho|accessdate=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== DarkSquidge ==
DarkSquidge is the name of Ridgewell's secondary channel on [[YouTube]] created in October 2007.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As of March 2018, the channel has over 780,000 subscribers and more than 101 million views.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/DarkSquidge/about|title=DarkSquidge channel - about section|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The content that Ridgewell uploads on this channel differs greatly from that of his main channel. While his main channel consists of sketch comedy and animations,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/TomSka/about|title=TomSka channel - about section|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; DarkSquidge shows behind the scenes footage of TomSka related projects and videos, as well as [[Video blog|vlogging]]. Ridgewell also engages in social commentary on this platform, covering a range of topics such as mental health, sexual health, and body positivity. The YouTuber uploaded weekly vlogs to the channel dubbed as "Last Week". After ending "Last Week", Tom then made a monthly vlogging series called "Last Month".

== Other projects ==
In 2014, Ridgewell, in collaboration with video game developer [[Pixel Spill Studios]], created the game ''KatataK'', a side-scrolling [[shoot 'em up]] for [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
| url = http://www.katatakgame.com/about
| title = KatataK
| website = www.katatakgame.com
| access-date = 27 February 2016
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Ridgewell worked with animator [[Matt Ley]] to create ''Art is Dead: the asdf book'', a comic book based on and featuring adapted sketches from his ''asdfmovie'' series.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=DarkSquidge|title=WE MADE A BOOK (Art is Dead reveal)|date=11 September 2015|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBKYOhshow|accessdate=27 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=DarkSquidge|title=ART IS DEAD IS OUT!!!|date=29 October 2015|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lduyZj5PiI|accessdate=27 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, TomSka filmed several sketches with the BBC in a trial for a potential sketch show on [[BBC Three]]. These sketches were not picked up by the BBC, however, and he later posted the clips on his own YouTube channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://teneightymagazine.com/2015/12/03/tom-ridgewell-working-with-bbc-comedy/|title=Tom Ridgewell Working with BBC Comedy – TenEighty — YouTube News, Features, and Interviews|website=teneightymagazine.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
