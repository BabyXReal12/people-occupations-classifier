He is a director of ''Little Mo Films'', which he had co-directed with the late [[Addison Cresswell]], who was also his agent prior to Cresswell's death in December 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gillan|first=Audrey|title=Profile: Addison Cresswell, he's a cockney wide-boy, not unlike Jonathan, very canny at building a business to represent big stars to the BBC|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/oct/31/jonathan-ross-russell-brand1|accessdate=23 August 2013|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=31 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evans has become one of Britain's highest-selling and legendary stand-up comedians, with his "Roadrunner" tour grossing £12.9&amp;nbsp;million. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/lee-evans|title=Lee Evans - Mirror|website=www.mirror.co.uk|access-date=2016-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also an established actor, having appeared in the [[Hollywood]] films ''[[The Fifth Element]]'' (1997), ''[[Mouse Hunt]]'' (1997), ''[[There's Something About Mary]]'' (1998), ''[[The Ladies Man (2000 film)|The Ladies Man]]'' (2000) and ''[[The Medallion]]'' (2003). He lent his voice to "Zippo the [[Troodon]]" in the [[Emmy]]-nominated [[miniseries]] ''[[Dinotopia (miniseries)|Dinotopia]]'' (2002) and made a notable departure from comedy with a leading role in the [[Ireland|Irish]] film ''[[Freeze Frame (2004 film)|Freeze Frame]]'' (2004). He had made his cinema debut with the [[Jerry Lewis]] comedy ''[[Funny Bones]]'' (1995), earning the [[Paris Film Festival|Paris Film Festival Award for Best Actor]].

In 2008, Evans' ''Big'' tour DVD ''Big – Live at the O2'' became the highest-selling Christmas DVD in the United Kingdom, only to be surpassed by his own ''[[Monsters Tour]]'' DVD in 2014. In November 2014 Evans officially announced his retirement.

==Early life==
Evans was born in [[Avonmouth]], [[Bristol]], to an Irish mother, Shirley Hunt, and a Welsh father, Dave Evans. He has an older brother, Wayne (born 1962).&lt;ref name="dailymail.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/moslive/article-2299933/Lee-Evans-I-bullied-I-went-kids-teachers--I-easy-target.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | title='I was bullied everywhere I went by the kids, the teachers... I was an easy target': The extraordinary trials and triumphs of Lee Evans, comedy's great survivor}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was a nightclub performer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6zEtZNBSD8#t=07m50s|title=Opie and Anthony – Lee Evans part 4|date=28 July 2010|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/55/Lee-Evans.html|title=Lee Evans profile at FilmReference.com|publisher=Filmreference.com|accessdate=4 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His family left Bristol in 1975, moving to [[Essex]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2012/11/30/16671/lee_evans_returns_to_the_west_end|title=Lee Evans returns to the West End|author=Powder Blue Internet Business Solutions|work=chortle.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he attended [[the Billericay School|Billericay School]] and reportedly was the victim of bullies.&lt;ref name="dailymail.co.uk"/&gt; After a spell as a [[boxer]] and two years at Thurrock Art College, also in Essex, Evans followed his father into entertainment. During his teenage years, he moved to [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire]], and he was a drummer in a [[punk rock]] band called The Anonymous Five.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/oooh-er-cripes-1325941.html|title=Oooh, er, cripes|last=White|first=Jim|date=27 January 1996|accessdate=28 April 2008|work=The Independent|location=UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Stand-up comedy===
Evans rose to fame during the 1990s with loud, hot, sweaty, energetic stage performances and physical [[observational comedy]]. His slapstick humour has led to comparisons with Sir [[Norman Wisdom]], though Evans does not regard Wisdom as an influence.&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/drama/3626118/%27All-I%27ve-ever-felt-on-stage-is-pain%27.html 'All I've ever felt on stage is pain'], [[Daily Telegraph]], 25 October 2004, "I saw his films as a kid. It surprises me because if you watch my act it's nothing like his really."&lt;/ref&gt; In his earlier work, he used a dysfunctional character called Malcolm to illustrate unusual characters. In 1993, he won the [[if.comedy award|Perrier Comedy Award]] for his work at the [[Edinburgh Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=if.comedy – Past winners. |url=http://www.if.com/eddies/past-winners.html |publisher=if.comedy |accessdate=27 February 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928194054/http://www.if.com/eddies/past-winners.html |archivedate=28 September 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evans' sweat drenches him on stage. During most of his headlining performances, he often takes an intermission, during which he has a quick shower and changes into a different suit. He has also said that his suits are regularly thrown away after three performances, mainly because of the sweat, with dry-cleaners refusing to handle them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|title=Lee Evans interview|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QiTXF0uMcI|date=31 October 2007|work=Daily Mirror|location=UK||accessdate=27 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2005, Evans broke the [[world record]] for a solo act performing to the biggest comedy audience, performing to 10,108 people at the [[Manchester Arena]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Comic Evans breaks crowd record|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4454572.stm|date=20 November 2005|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=27 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evans toured the UK in autumn 2008 with his stand-up act entitled "Big". During his "Big" tour he performed in front of over 500,000 people on 59 dates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leeevansbigtour.co.uk/index.html|title=Lee Evans: Big On Tour 2008|publisher=Leeevansbigtour.co.uk |accessdate=4 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was scheduled to involve the first ever performance by a comedian at the [[The O2 arena (London)|O2 Arena]] in London until [[Chris Rock]] announced dates that would take place at the venue prior to Evans. The DVD was filmed at the O2 arena and was released on 24 November 2008 and it became the best selling comedy DVD in the UK for Christmas 2008 selling over 1,000,000 copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2008/12/22/8027/lees_big_achievement|title=Lee's Big achievement: News 2008 |publisher=Chortle.co.uk |date=22 December 2008|accessdate=4 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2009/01/12/8110/lee_evans_sells_a_million_dvds|title=Lee Evans sells a million DVDs |publisher=Chortle.co.uk |accessdate=4 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evans appeared on the [[Channel 4's Comedy Gala]] for [[Great Ormond Street Hospital]] on 30 March 2010. He was the last act on stage and he received a comedy award and auctioned it to the audience for charity.

Evans toured the UK again in 2011 with a new stand-up act entitled "Roadrunner", with 50 dates starting with [[Bournemouth]] in August, running until November in [[Cardiff]]. He appeared at the Wyvern Theatre, [[Swindon]] on 10 June to test his new material (reading from notes) for the "Roadrunner" tour. He then sold out [[Bristol]]'s Colston Hall for 3 nights to perfect his routine in July. The tour visited most of the UK's major cities, plus two nights in [[Dublin]], and included four nights in [[Wembley Arena]] and four in the O2 Arena, meaning around 100,000 seats in London alone. Tickets went on sale Friday 15 October 2010 at 9&amp;nbsp;am.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2010/10/12/11920/lee_evans_to_tour_again#ixzz12Q4Tcrqu |title=Lee Evans to Tour again in 2011|publisher=Chortle.co.uk|accessdate=4 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evans sold £7,000,000 worth of tickets the first day they went on sale. Due to popular demand, there were a further 17 dates added to the tour in [[Bournemouth International Centre]], [[Brighton Centre]], [[Capital FM Arena]], [[Wembley Arena]], [[National Indoor Arena]], [[The O2 Arena (London)|The O2]], [[Echo Arena]], [[Motorpoint Arena Cardiff|Motorpoint Arena]], [[Odyssey Arena]] and [[The O2 (Dublin)|The O2]]. This brought the tour up to 67 dates in 14 cities which is 8 more than the record breaking tour of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leeevans2011tour.co.uk/ |title=Lee Evans announces extra tour dates|publisher=Leeevans2011tour.co.uk|accessdate=4 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, he was honoured by the British Comedy Awards with the Channel 4 award for special contribution to comedy.

In November 2014, Evans announced on ''[[The Jonathan Ross Show]]'' that he was retiring from stand-up comedy to spend more time with his wife Heather and daughter Mollie who was studying at university in Florida.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/11242793/Lee-Evans-Im-retiring-from-comedy-to-spend-more-time-with-my-wife.html|title=Lee Evans: I'm retiring from comedy to spend more time with my wife|date=20 November 2014|work=Daily Telegraph|accessdate=20 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/comedy/news/lee-evans-announces-retirement-from-comedy-on-the-jonathan-ross-show-9872538.html|title=Lee Evans announces retirement from comedy on The Jonathan Ross Show|date=20 November 2014|work=Independent|accessdate=20 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
