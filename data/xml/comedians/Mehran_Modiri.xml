}}'''Mehran Modiri''' ({{lang-fa| مهران مدیری }}, born  April 7, 1967) is a prolific Iranian actor, television and cinema director, comedian and musician. His artistic career began in his teenage years as he was acting in local [[Play (theatre)|plays]]. He then entered the world of radio and television in the early 1990s, actively writing scripts for and participating in various comedy skits during the annual [[Norooz]] comedy television shows broadcast by the [[IRIB]].

He continued appearing in television comedies, however, he achieved real stardom with his creation of ''[[Pavarchin]]'' (''Tiptoeing''), in which he won numerous awards for directing and starring in the picture. He tasted success again when he directed and starred in ''[[Noghtechin]]'' (''Ellipsis''), and ''[[Jayezeye Bozorg]]'' (''The Grand Prize''), which became major hits on television in Iran{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}.

Afterwards, he followed ''Pavarchin'''s storyline with the making of ''[[Shabhaye Barareh]]'' which became his most popular television program yet; the show remained incomplete after it was criticized for offending rural people, which resulted in an abrupt end to the show after 92 episodes, without completely explaining the [[Barareh]] history.

He has starred in two full length films, and had planned on entering the film industry once again after ''Shabhaye Barareh'' was completed. However, he instead started working on his next project, television series ''[[Baghe Mozaffar]]''.

Modiri also released a music album and performed in a number of concerts. He is also a veteran of the [[Iran–Iraq War]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}. 

In 2009 Modiri was named by ''[[Newsweek]]'' as one of the 20 people who dominate power and public discourse in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Iran's Top 20: Power and public discourse in the Islamic Republic are dominated by fewer than two dozen heavyweights, ranging from ayatollahs to entertainers (and one TV network) |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2009/05/22/iran-s-top-20.html |accessdate=27 September 2012 |work=[[Newsweek]] |date=1 June 2009 |page=36 |quote=Today his television comedies rule Iran's airwaves, with audiences so big that broadcast executives don't balk at his lampoons of Iranian life }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Mehran Modiri is the last child of the family. He has three elder brothers. He is married and has two children (Shahrzad and Farhad). 
Modiri was born and raised in a low income family. He worked in many physical and low paying jobs as a child and teenager, including carpenter, porter, welder, mechanic and baker. Due to his successful career, he is known to be wealthy but Modiri claims to live a modest lifestyle. He has had a Python snake for 11 years that lives freely in his house.

== Filmography ==
Mehran Modiri has acted in various TV series. Most of the popularity and fame he has garnered among the people of [[Iran]] emanates from his participation in these programs. 

His first movie as a director is Saat-e-5-e-asr ([http://www.filmnetnews.ir/picture-gallery/%D9%85%D9%87%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%85%D8%AF%DB%8C%D8%B1%DB%8C-%D8%B3%DB%8C%D8%A7%D9%85%DA%A9-%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%B5%D8%A7%D8%B1%DB%8C-%D8%B9%DA%A9%D8%B3 ساعت پنج عصر] in Persian - means: 5 O'clock in the afternoon) had a great start in [http://www.filmnetnews.ir/hyper-news/report-about-movies/%D8%AC%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%84-%D9%81%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%B4-%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%AA-%DB%B5-%D8%B9%D8%B5%D8%B1-%D8%A7%DA%A9%D8%B3%DB%8C%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%86 Iran's Box Office].
