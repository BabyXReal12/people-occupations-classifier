'''Ashley Michelle Tisdale''' (born July 2, 1985) is an American actress, singer, and producer. During her childhood, Tisdale was featured in over 100 advertisements and had minor roles in television and theatre. She achieved mainstream success as Maddie Fitzpatrick in the [[Disney Channel]] series ''[[The Suite Life of Zack &amp; Cody]]''. This success was heightened when she starred as [[Sharpay Evans]] in the ''[[High School Musical (franchise)|High School Musical]]'' franchise. The film series proved to be a huge success for Disney and earned a large following. The success of the films led to Tisdale signing with [[Warner Bros. Records]], releasing her debut album, ''[[Headstrong (Ashley Tisdale album)|Headstrong]]'' (2007), through the label. The album was a commercial success, earning a gold certification from the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). She starred as [[Candace Flynn]] in the animated series ''[[Phineas &amp; Ferb]]'' from 2007 to 2015.

Tisdale's second studio album, ''[[Guilty Pleasure (Ashley Tisdale album)|Guilty Pleasure]]'' (2009), was released to less commercial success than its predecessor. Tisdale would part ways with Warner Bros. Records following the release of the album. During this time, Tisdale began appearing in more films and returned to television with shows such as ''[[Hellcats]]'' (2010). Tisdale's production company Blondie Girl Productions, first formed in 2008, signed a multi-year production deal with [[Relativity Media]] in 2010; Tisdale would produce shows such as ''[[Miss Advised]]'' (2012) as part of the deal. Tisdale starred in the ''High School Musical'' spin-off film ''[[Sharpay's Fabulous Adventure]]'' (2011), releasing a soundtrack to promote the film. This marked her final portrayal of the character to date.

Tisdale announced work on her third studio album in 2013, releasing the promotional single "[[You're Always Here]]" (2013). She had the leading role in the horror comedy film ''[[Scary Movie 5]]'' (2013). Tisdale has continued to appear in television roles, joining the main cast of ''[[Clipped (TV series)|Clipped]]'' (2015). She also serves as executive producer of the [[ABC Family]] television series ''[[Young &amp; Hungry]]''. Tisdale began dating singer Christopher French in 2012; the couple wed in 2014. In September 2015, Tisdale was named the creative director of Signorelli. She launched her Illuminate makeup brand in 2016. In 2017 she confirmed that she is working on her third studio album, although no details of its release were given.
