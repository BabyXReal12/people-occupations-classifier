'''Steven Alexander Wright''' (born December 6, 1955) is an American stand-up comedian, actor, writer, and [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winning film producer. He is known for his distinctly lethargic voice and slow, [[deadpan]] delivery of [[irony|ironic]], [[Philosophy#Contemporary philosophy (c. 1900 – present)|philosophical]] and sometimes nonsensical [[joke]]s, [[paraprosdokian]]s, [[non sequitur (literary device)|non sequiturs]], [[anti-humor]], and [[one-liner joke|one-liners]] with contrived situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/arts/comedian-steven-wright-on-his-deadpan-style-getting-inspired-by-salvador-dali-working-with-quentin-tarantino-and-more-6555970|title=Comedian Steven Wright on His Deadpan Style, Getting Inspired By Salvador Dali, Working With Quentin Tarantino, and More|last=Leatherman|first=Benjamin|work=[[Phoenix New Times]]|date=8 May 2012|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982 executive producer of ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' [[Peter Lassally]] saw Wright performing on a bill with other local comics at the Ding Ho comedy club,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sevenstories.com/blogs/87-in-memory-of-barry-crimmins|title=In Memory of Barry Crimmins|author=|date=|website=sevenstories.com|accessdate=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=punch&gt;[http://punchlinemagazine.com/site/2008/12/steven-wright-inducted-into-hall-a-citys-comedy-history-celebrated/ Turbovsky, Rob.

== Stand-up success ==
Wright's 1985 comedy album was entitled ''[[I Have a Pony]]''. It was released on [[Warner Bros. Records]], received critical acclaim and was nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album]]. The success of this album landed him an HBO special which he recorded as a live college concert performance, ''A Steven Wright Special.'' By then Wright had firmly developed a new brand of obscure, laid-back performing and was rapidly building a cult-like following of hip, savvy fans and an onstage persona characterized by an aura of obscurity, with his penchant for non-sequiturs and subdued, slowly-paced delivery style only adding to his mystique. His opening act for the HBO concert was fellow "Ding Ho" comedy alumnus [[Bill Sohonage]], who claimed that Steven's ultra-casual, nearly catatonic demeanor was no act. "He walked into my dressing room, minutes before I was to take the stage, and asked if he could borrow a shirt, as his had a giant pizza stain. You would think it might be normal to be a little nervous going on a college stage in front of 23,000, let alone having HBO out there filming, but as I passed by his room while walking on-stage I saw him sound asleep and loudly snoring." The performance would become one of HBO's longest running and most requested comedy specials, and would propel him to great success on the college-arena concert circuit.

In 1989 he and fellow producer [[Dean Parisot]] won an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for their 30-minute short film "[[The Appointments of Dennis Jennings]]," directed by Parisot, written by Mike Armstrong and Wright, and starring Wright and [[Rowan Atkinson]]. Upon accepting the Oscar, Wright said, "We're really glad that we cut out the other sixty minutes." In 1992 Wright had a recurring role on the television sitcom ''[[Mad About You]].'' He also supplied the voice of the radio DJ in writer-director [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s film ''[[Reservoir Dogs]]'' that same year. "Dean Parisot's wife [[Sally Menke]] is Quentin Tarantino's [[film editor|[film] editor]], so when she was editing the movie and it was getting down toward the end where they didn't have the radio DJ yet, she thought of me and told Quentin and he liked the idea," Wright explained in 2009.&lt;ref name=newsday /&gt;

Numerous lists of jokes attributed to Wright circulate on the Internet, sometimes of dubious origin. Wright has stated, "Someone showed me a site, and half of it that said I wrote it, I didn't write. Recently, I saw one, and I didn't write any of it. What's disturbing is that with a few of these jokes, I wish I had thought of them. A giant amount of them, I'm embarrassed that people think I thought of them, because some are really bad."&lt;ref&gt;Tasha Robinson, [http://www.avclub.com/article/steven-wright-13796 "Interview: Steven Wright,"] ''[[The A.V. Club]]'', January 29, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

After his 1990 comedy special ''Wicker Chairs and Gravity,'' Wright continued to do stand-up performances, but he was largely absent from television, doing only occasional guest spots on late-night talk shows. In 1999 he wrote and directed the 30-minute short ''[[One Soldier]]'' saying it's "about a soldier who was in the [[US Civil War|Civil War]], right after the war, with all these [[existentialist]] thoughts and wondering if there is a God and all that stuff."&lt;ref name=newsday /&gt;

In 2006 Wright produced his first stand-up special in 16 years, ''Steven Wright: [[When the Leaves Blow Away]],'' originally aired on [[Comedy Central]] on October 21, 2006. Its DVD was released April 23, 2007.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} On September 25, 2007 Wright released his second album, ''[[I Still Have a Pony]]'', a CD release of the material from ''When The Leaves Blow Away.'' It was nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album]], but lost to ''[[The Distant Future]]'' by [[Flight of the Conchords]].

== Awards and honors ==
Steven Wright was awarded an Oscar in 1989 for Best Short Live-Action Film for ''[[The Appointments of Dennis Jennings]]'', which he co-wrote (with Michael Armstrong) and starred in.&lt;ref&gt;Nathan Rabin, [http://www.avclub.com/article/steven-wright-14029 "Interview: Steven Wright,"] ''The A.V. Club'', November 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; He received two [[Emmy]] nominations as part of the producing team of ''[[Louie (U.S. TV series)|Louie]]'', first in [[66th Primetime Emmy Awards|2014]] and again in [[67th Primetime Emmy Awards|2015]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/bios/steven-wright|title=Steven Wright – Television Academy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 15, 2008, Wright became the first inductee to the Boston Comedy Hall of Fame.&lt;ref name=punch /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Jay, N. "The Wright stuff; Boston comedian is first inductee into hall of fame", ''[[The Patriot Ledger]]'' ([[Quincy, Massachusetts]]), December 15, 2008, Features; pg. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2005 poll to find ''The Comedian's Comedian'', he was voted amongst the top 50 comedy acts by fellow comedians and comedy insiders. He was named No. 23 on [[Comedy Central]]'s list of the 100 greatest stand-up comics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1532323 Comedy Central's 100 Greatest Stand-Ups of all Time], Everything2.com&lt;/ref&gt;
