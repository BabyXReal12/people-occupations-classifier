Shepard has said that he was raised in Milford,&lt;ref name=WTF-Maron-2014 /&gt; although he lived in a lot of places in suburban Detroit, growing up primarily in [[Walled Lake, Michigan]]. He graduated from [[Walled Lake Central High School]] in 1993&lt;ref name=FoxDetroit-HitandRun-2012&gt;{{cite web|title=Dax Shepard pays tribute to FOX 2 anchor in new movie|url=http://www.wmyt12.com/story/18980300/2012/07/09/dax-shepard-pays-tribute-to-fox-2-anchor-in-new-movie|work=[[WJBK]]|accessdate=November 30, 2013|date=July 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; before enrolling in [[The Groundlings|The Groundlings school]].&lt;ref name=Groundlings&gt;{{cite web|title=Performers – Dax Shepard |url=http://groundlings.com/performers/performer-details.aspx?performerID=380 |work=[[The Groundlings]] |accessdate=November 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After attending [[Santa Monica College]] and [[West Los Angeles College]], Shepard transferred to [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]], where he graduated ''[[magna cum laude]]'' with a B.A. in Anthropology.&lt;ref name=IGN-Paddle-2004&gt;{{cite web|title=Dax Shepard and Matthew Lillard|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2004/08/19/dax-shepard-and-matthew-lillard|work=[[IGN]]|accessdate=November 30, 2013|last=D. |first=Spence|date=August 19, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had a deal with his mother that if he went to college she would pay his rent.&lt;ref name=WTF-Maron-2014 /&gt;

Shepard has said he wasn't interested in child-acting per se. He was a class clown in school, had a sense he was funny, and wanted to do stand-up. Although he had friends who did stand-up in Detroit, he was too scared. Shepard thought if he moved to California "that commitment would force him to do it."&lt;ref name=WTF-Maron-2014 /&gt;

== Career ==
[[File:Dax Shepard at the 2008 Tribeca Film Festival.JPG|thumb|150px|Shepard at the 2008 [[Tribeca Film Festival]] in New York City]]
After a year in [[Santa Barbara, California]], Shepard moved to Los Angeles in 1996. He found out about [[The Groundlings]] improv troupe from a friend from Santa Barbara, Kareem Elseify, ended up auditioning (the first time he acted), and took classes while also attending UCLA. After about five years of classes, he got into the Sunday Company of The Groundlings—in a group that included [[Melissa McCarthy]], [[Tate Taylor]] and [[Nat Faxon]].&lt;ref name=WTF-Maron-2014 /&gt;

From 2003 onwards, Shepard became known from his work in the improv [[Candid Camera]]-type show, ''[[Punk'd]],'' with [[Ashton Kutcher]]. When the show had its 2012 revival, he continued to appear. Shepard said he auditioned for ''[[Punk'd]]'' and while doing the pilot became friendly with Kutcher, who arranged for him to get an agent.&lt;ref name=WTF-Maron-2014 /&gt; He auditioned unsuccessfully for 10 years before he landed the role.&lt;ref name=WTF-Maron-2014 /&gt;

In 2004, Shepard starred in the comedy ''[[Without a Paddle]]'', alongside [[Seth Green]] and [[Matthew Lillard]]. The film received negative reviews but was a commercial success, grossing $69,631,118 worldwide.&lt;ref name=BoxOfficeMojo-Paddle&gt;{{cite web |title=Without A Paddle (2004) |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=withoutapaddle.htm |work=[[Box Office Mojo]] |accessdate=September 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 he starred as The Astronaut in ''[[Zathura: A Space Adventure]]'', a science fiction adventure fantasy film. In 2006, he appeared with [[Dane Cook]] and [[Jessica Simpson]] in the comedy ''[[Employee of the Month (2006 film)|Employee of the Month]]'' and in Mike Judge's film ''[[Idiocracy]]''.

During the same time, Shepard began appearing in more films and landed his first main character role in ''[[Let's Go to Prison]]'' (2006), alongside [[Will Arnett]] and [[Chi McBride]]. He also had a main role in the 2008 comedy ''[[Baby Mama (film)|Baby Mama]]'', starring opposite [[Tina Fey]] and [[Amy Poehler]]. Shepard wrote the script for the [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] venture ''Get 'Em Wet'', in which he again appeared with Arnett. In 2010, he wrote, directed and starred in the low-budget satirical [[mockumentary]] feature ''[[Brother's Justice]]''; the film won an Audience Award at the 2010 [[Austin Film Festival]]. He also had a supporting role in the 2010 [[romantic comedy]] film ''[[When in Rome (2010 film)|When in Rome]]'', which also starred his future wife [[Kristen Bell]].

From 2010 to 2015, Shepard was part of the main cast of the NBC drama ''[[Parenthood (2010 TV series)|Parenthood]]'', playing Crosby Braverman.&lt;ref name=Variety-Parenthood-2009&gt;{{cite news|title=First impressions – "Parenthood"|url=https://variety.com/2009/tv/news/first-impressions-parenthood-18305/|accessdate=September 21, 2014|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=July 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Variety-Parenthood-2010&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lowry|first1=Brian|title=Review: ‘Parenthood’|url=https://variety.com/2010/tv/reviews/parenthood-1117942321/|accessdate=September 21, 2014|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=February 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HReporter-Parenthood-2014&gt;{{cite news|last1=Goldberg|first1=Lesley|title=NBC Renews 'Parenthood' for Sixth and Final Season|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/nbc-renews-parenthood-sixth-final-703049|accessdate=September 21, 2014|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=May 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
