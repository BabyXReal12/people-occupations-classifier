'''Gilda Susan Radner''' (June 28, 1946&amp;nbsp;– May 20, 1989) was an American comedian, writer, actress, and one of seven [[Saturday Night Live cast members|original cast members]] of the [[NBC]] sketch comedy show ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (''SNL''). In her routines, Radner specialized in parodies of television stereotypes, such as advice specialists and news anchors. She also portrayed those characters in her highly successful one-woman show on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in 1979.

Radner's ''SNL'' work established her as an iconic figure in the history of American comedy. She died from ovarian cancer in 1989. Her autobiography dealt frankly with her life, work, and personal struggles, including those with the illness. Her widower, [[Gene Wilder]], carried out her personal wish that information about her illness would help other cancer victims, founding and inspiring organizations that emphasize early diagnosis, hereditary factors and support for cancer victims.

==Early life==
Radner was born in [[Detroit]], Michigan, to Jewish parents, Henrietta (née Dworkin), a legal secretary, and Herman Radner, a businessman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Fighting for Life|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=LA&amp;p_theme=la&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EF566CE73772D91&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id|work=Los Angeles Daily News|date=July 11, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/41/Gilda-Radner.html|title=Gilda Radner profile|website=Film Reference|accessdate=March 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through her mother, Radner was a second cousin of business executive [[Steve Ballmer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19980125&amp;slug=2730718|title=Business - Microsoft's Heir Apparent -- Steve Ballmer - Seattle Times Newspaper|website=community.seattletimes.nwsource.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; She grew up in Detroit with a nanny, Elizabeth Clementine Gillies, whom she called "Dibby" (and on whom she based her famous character [[Emily Litella]]),&lt;ref name=CBC90&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.cbc.ca/arts_entertainment/television/clips/16242|accessdate=January 24, 2009 |title=Michaels and Radner talk SNL|publisher=[[CBC Television]]|work=[[90 Minutes Live]]|date=February 2, 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an older brother named Michael. She attended the exclusive [[University Liggett School]] in Detroit (it began its relocation to [[Grosse Pointe]] later that{{which?|date=June 2018}} year). Toward the end of her life, Radner wrote in her autobiography, ''It's Always Something'', that during her childhood and young adulthood, she battled numerous eating disorders: "I coped with stress by having every possible eating disorder from the time I was nine years old. I have weighed as much as 160 pounds and as little as 93. When I was a kid, I overate constantly. My weight distressed my mother and she took me to a doctor who put me on [[Dextroamphetamine|Dexedrine]] diet pills when I was ten years old."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Radner, Gilda|title=It's Always Something|location= New York|publisher= Simon and Schuster|date= 1989|page= 97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Radner was close to her father, who operated Detroit's Seville Hotel, where many nightclub performers and actors stayed while performing in the city.&lt;ref name="saltman"&gt;{{cite book|author=Saltman, David|title=Gilda: An Intimate Portrait|location= Chicago|publisher= Contemporary Books|date= 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; He took her on trips to New York to see [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] shows.&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt;  As Radner wrote in ''It's Always Something'', when she was 12, her father developed a [[brain tumor]], and the symptoms began so suddenly that he told people his eyeglasses were too tight.&lt;ref name="Radner, Gilda 1989, p. 99"&gt;{{cite book|author=Radner, Gilda|title=It's Always Something|location= New York|publisher= Simon and Schuster|date= 1989|page= 99}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within days, he was bedridden and unable to communicate, and remained in that condition until his death two years later.&lt;ref name="Radner, Gilda 1989, p. 99"/&gt;

Radner graduated from Liggett and enrolled at the [[University of Michigan]] at [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]] in 1964.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

==Career==
In Ann Arbor, Radner dropped out in her senior year&lt;ref name="something"&gt;{{cite book|author=Radner, Gilda|title=It's Always Something|location= New York|publisher= Simon &amp; Schuster|date= 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; to follow her boyfriend, Canadian sculptor [[Jeffrey Rubinoff]], to [[Toronto]], where she made her professional acting debut in the 1972 production of ''[[Godspell]]'' with future stars [[Eugene Levy]], [[Andrea Martin]], [[Victor Garber]], [[Martin Short]], and [[Paul Shaffer]]. Afterward, Radner joined [[The Second City]] comedy troupe in Toronto.

Radner was a featured player on the ''[[National Lampoon, Incorporated|National Lampoon]] Radio Hour'', a comedy program syndicated to some 600 U.S. radio stations from 1974 to 1975. Fellow cast members included [[John Belushi]],&lt;ref name="NPR"&gt;{{cite web|title='The National Lampoon Radio Hour'|url=https://www.npr.org/2003/11/17/1505048/the-national-lampoon-radio-hour|website=NPR.org|accessdate=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chevy Chase]],&lt;ref name="NPR" /&gt; [[Richard Belzer]], [[Bill Murray]], [[Brian Doyle-Murray]], and [[Rhonda Coullet]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===''Saturday Night Live''===
Radner gained name recognition as one of the original "[[Not Ready for Prime Time Players]]", the freshman group on the first (1975) season of ''Saturday Night Live''. She was the first performer cast for the show,&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt; co-wrote much of the material that she performed, and collaborated with [[Alan Zweibel]] (of the show's writing staff) on sketches that highlighted her recurring characters.&lt;ref name="zweibel"&gt;{{cite book|author=Zweibel, Alan|title=Bunny Bunny: Gilda Radner|location= New York|publisher= Villard|date= 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1975 and 1980, she created characters such as obnoxious personal advice expert [[Roseanne Roseannadanna]] and "Baba Wawa", a parody of [[Barbara Walters]]. After Radner's death, Walters stated in an interview that Radner was the "first person to make fun of news anchors, now it's done all the time."&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|LQvRFrpKi-0|Barbara Walters being interviewed about Gilda Radner }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

{{Quote box |quote = "Of the three female cast members [SNL], Gilda Radner made the deepest impact. There is hardly a female sketch comic today who does not claim Radner as an inspiration for her comedy career."|source = Yael Kohen,&lt;br&gt;author, ''We Killed: The Rise of Women in American Comedy''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kohen, Yael|title=We Killed: The Rise of Women in American Comedy|publisher= Macmillan |date=2012|pages= 107–108}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/02/books/review/we-killed-by-yael-kohen.html |title=Funny Women|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;|fontsize = 95% |width  = 25% |align  = left|bgcolor = Cornsilk|}}

She also played the character [[Emily Litella]], an elderly, hearing-impaired woman who gave angry and misinformed editorial replies on "[[Weekend Update]]".&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt; Additionally, Radner parodied celebrities such as [[Lucille Ball]], [[Patti Smith]], and [[Olga Korbut]] in ''SNL'' sketches. She won an [[Emmy Award]] in 1978 for her work on ''SNL''.  In ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s February 2015 appraisal of all 141 ''SNL'' cast members to date, Radner was ranked ninth in importance.  "[Radner was] the most beloved of the original cast," they wrote. "In the years between Mary Tyler Moore and ''Seinfeld's'' Elaine, Radner was the prototype for the brainy city girl with a bundle of neuroses."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|magazine=Rolling Stone|issue =1229|date= February 26, 2015|page= 32|title=''SNL'' cast members}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Radner battled [[Bulimia nervosa|bulimia]] while on the show. She had a relationship with ''SNL'' castmate [[Bill Murray]], with whom she worked at the ''National Lampoon'', which ended badly. Few details of their relationship or its end were made public. In ''It's Always Something,'' this is the one reference Radner made to Murray in the entire book: "All the guys [in the ''National Lampoon'' group of writers and performers] liked to have me around because I would laugh at them till I peed in my pants and tears rolled out of my eyes. We worked together for a couple of years creating ''The National Lampoon Show,'' writing ''The National Lampoon Radio Hour,'' and even working on stuff for the magazine. Bill Murray joined the show and Richard Belzer&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Radner, Gilda|title=It's Always Something|location= New York|publisher=Simon and Schuster|date= 1989|pages=100–101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, incoming NBC President [[Fred Silverman]] offered Radner her own primetime variety show, which she turned down.&lt;ref name="something"/&gt; That year, she was a host of the [[Music for UNICEF Concert]] at the [[United Nations General Assembly]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

[[Alan Zweibel]], who co-created the Roseanne Roseannadanna character and co-wrote Roseanne's dialogue, recalled that Radner, one of three original ''SNL'' cast members who stayed away from cocaine, chastised him for abusing it.&lt;ref name="zweibel"/&gt;

While in character as Roseanne Roseannadanna, Radner gave the commencement address to the graduating class at the [[Columbia School of Journalism]] in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://journalistfightclub.blogspot.com/2008/04/roseanne-roseannadanna-vs-columbia.html|title=-journalist FIGHTclub|website=Journalist Fight Club}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Radner had mixed emotions about the fans and strangers who recognized her in public. She sometimes became "angry when she was approached [by strangers in public], and upset when she wasn't," according to the book by Hill and Weingrad.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;Hill, Doug and Jeff Weingrad. ''Saturday Night: A Backstage History of Saturday Night Live''. New York: Beech Tree Books. 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Work in theater, a record album and her first movie===
In 1979, Radner appeared on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in the successful one-woman show, ''Gilda Radner - Live From New York''.&lt;ref name="ibdb"&gt;{{IBDB name|5910}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show featured material that was racier than NBC censors allowed on ''Saturday Night Live'', such as the song "Let's Talk Dirty to the Animals". In 1979, shortly before Radner's final season on ''Saturday Night Live'', her Broadway show was filmed by [[Mike Nichols]] under the title ''[[Gilda Live]]'', co-starring [[Paul Shaffer]] and [[Don Novello]], and the movie was released in theaters nationwide in 1980, with poor results. A [[soundtrack album]] was also unsuccessful. During the Broadway production, Radner met her first husband, [[G. E. Smith]], a musician who worked on the show. They were married in a civil ceremony in 1980.&lt;ref name="something"/&gt;

In the fall of 1980, after all original ''SNL'' cast members departed from the show, Radner began working with actor [[Sam Waterston]] in the [[Jean Kerr]] play ''Lunch Hour''.  They played two people whose spouses are having an affair, and as a reaction they start their own relationship consisting of trysts on their lunch hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hischak, Thomas S. |title=American Theatre: A Chronicle of Comedy and Drama, 1969–2000|publisher= Oxford University Press|date= 2001|isbn= 0-19-512347-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show ran for more than seven months in various theaters in the United States, including the [[John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]  Newspaper critics, including [[Tom Shales]], praised the play and Radner's performance in it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1980/10/03/good-as-gilda/c96b73c8-4804-47df-b073-ebb1acee6892/|title=Good as Gilda|last=Shales|first=Tom|date=1980-10-03|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-01-30|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life==
Radner was first married to musician [[G. E. Smith]], they divorced in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.timeinc.net/time/4502772/gene-wilder-gilda-radner-romance&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gesmithmusic.com/about/|title=Bio|date=May 13, 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radner met actor [[Gene Wilder]] on the set of the [[Sidney Poitier]] film ''[[Hanky Panky (1982 film)|Hanky Panky]]'' (released in 1982), when the two worked together making the film. She described their first meeting as "[[love at first sight]]".&lt;ref name="something"/&gt; She was unable to control her attraction to Wilder as her marriage to guitarist G. E. Smith deteriorated. Radner went on to make a second film with Wilder, ''[[The Woman in Red (1984 film)|The Woman in Red]]'' (released in 1984), and their relationship grew. The two were married on September 18, 1984, in [[Saint-Tropez]].&lt;ref name="something"/&gt;  The pair made a third film together, ''[[Haunted Honeymoon]]'' (released in 1986)&lt;ref name="something"/&gt; and remained married until her death in 1989.

Details of Radner's eating disorder were reported in a book about ''Saturday Night Live'' by Doug Hill and Jeff Weingrad,&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;  The book by Hill and Weingrad was published and received much media coverage during a period when Radner was consulting various doctors in Los Angeles about her symptoms of illness that turned out to be cancer.

==Illness==
[[File:GildaRadner-walkoffame.jpg|thumb|right|Radner's star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]]]
In 1985, Radner was experiencing severe fatigue and suffered from pain in her upper legs on the set of ''Haunted Honeymoon'' in the [[United Kingdom]]. She sought medical treatment, and for a period of 10 months, various doctors, most of them in [[Los Angeles]], gave her several diagnoses that all turned out to be wrong because she continued to experience pain.&lt;ref name="something"/&gt;

During those 10 months, she faced hardships such as the publication of Hill and Weingrad's highly publicized book about ''Saturday Night Live'', which provided many details about her eating disorder&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;&lt;ref name="something"/&gt; as well as the financial failure of ''Haunted Honeymoon'', which grossed only $8,000,000 in the United States, entering the box office at number 8, then slipping to 14 the following week. As Radner wrote in ''It's Always Something'', "On July 26 [1986], ''Haunted Honeymoon'' opened nationwide. It was a bomb. One month of publicity and the movie was only in the theaters for a week – a box-office disaster."&lt;ref name="something"/&gt;

Finally, on October 21, 1986, Radner was diagnosed with [[Stage 4 cancer|stage IV]] [[ovarian cancer]].&lt;ref name="something"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cr"&gt;{{cite web|author=Song, Jenny|url=http://www.crmagazine.org/archive/spring%202009/Pages/AmericasFunnyGirl.aspx |title=America's Funny Girl|website= CRMagazine.org|date= Spring 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; "She immediately underwent surgery and had a hysterectomy," wrote Jenny Song in a 2009 magazine article published by the [[American Association for Cancer Research]].&lt;ref name="cr"/&gt; On October 26, "surgeons removed a grapefruit-size tumor from her abdomen," the article continued. Radner then began [[chemotherapy]] and [[radiation therapy]] treatment, as she wrote in ''It's Always Something'', and the treatment caused extreme physical and emotional pain.&lt;ref name="something"/&gt;

After her diagnosis, the ''[[National Enquirer]]'' ran the headline "Gilda Radner In Life-Death Struggle" in its following issue.  Without asking for her comment,&lt;ref name="something"/&gt; the editors of the publication asserted that she was dying. Radner wrote in ''It's Always Something'':  "They found an old photo of me looking frightened from a 'Saturday Night Live' sketch and blew that up to make the point. What they did probably sold newspapers, but it had a devastating effect on my family and my friends.  It forced Gene [Wilder] to compose a press release to respond.  He said that I had been diagnosed with ovarian cancer, had had surgery, and my prognosis was good.  The ''Enquirer'' doesn't like good news, so the Gilda Radner story stopped running."&lt;ref name="something"/&gt;

Four months after her ordeal with the ''National Enquirer'', Radner saw her ''Saturday Night Live'' castmates one last time at [[Laraine Newman]]'s 35th birthday party (in March 1987).  According to Bill Murray&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shales|first=Tom|title=Live From New York: An Uncensored History Of Saturday Night Live|year=2010|isbn=0-316-73565-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aNDb1d2i9KkC&amp;lpg=PT317&amp;vq=Gilda%20got%20married%20and%20went%20away&amp;pg=PT318#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; when he heard she was leaving the party, he and [[Dan Aykroyd]] carried her around the Los Angeles house where the party was held, repeatedly saying goodbye to everyone.  Since all the guests were comedians, they all did comedy bits with her repeatedly.

===Remission===
After Radner was told that she had gone into [[Cure#Remission|remission]], she wrote ''It's Always Something'' (a catchphrase of her character [[Roseanne Roseannadanna]]'s),&lt;ref name="something"/&gt; which included details of her struggle with the illness. ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' did a March 1988 cover story on her illness, titled "Gilda Radner's Answer to Cancer: Healing the Body with Mind and Heart."
In 1988, Radner guest-starred on ''[[It's Garry Shandling's Show]]'' on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] TV, to critical acclaim. When Shandling asked her why she had not been seen in public for a while, she replied, "Oh, I had cancer. What did ''you'' have?" Shandling's reply: "A very bad series of career moves&amp;nbsp;... which, by the way, there's no treatment for whatsoever."  She repeated on-camera [[Mark Twain]]'s apocryphal saying,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/quotes/twain.asp|title=Mark Twain on Coldest Winter|publisher=[[Snopes.com]]|date=September 26, 2007|accessdate=June 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Reports of my death are greatly exaggerated." Radner planned to host an episode of ''Saturday Night Live'' [[Saturday Night Live (season 13)|that year]],{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} but a [[1988 Writers Guild of America strike|writers' strike]] caused the delay of the network television season.

===Illness and death===
In September 1988, after tests showed no signs of cancer, Radner went on a [[maintenance chemotherapy]] treatment to prolong her remission, but three months later, in December, she learned the cancer had returned.&lt;ref name="cr"/&gt; She was admitted to [[Cedars-Sinai Medical Center]] in Los Angeles on May 17, 1989, to undergo a [[CT scan]]. She was given a sedative and went into a coma during the scan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Karras|first1=Steve|title=Gilda Radner Remembered|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/steve-karras/gilda-radner-club_b_2366303.html|accessdate=3 April 2018|publisher=Huffington Post|date=January 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She did not regain consciousness and died three days later, from ovarian cancer on May 20, 1989; Wilder was at her side.&lt;ref name="obit"&gt;{{cite news|author=Hevesi, Dennis|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DEFD81230F932A15756C0A96F948260 |title=Gilda Radner, 42, Comic Original Of 'Saturday Night Live' Zaniness|newspaper=The New York Times|date= May 21, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

News of her death broke as [[Steve Martin]] was rehearsing to act as the guest host for that night's season finale of ''Saturday Night Live''. The show's performers and crew, including [[Lorne Michaels]], [[Phil Hartman]], and [[Mike Myers]] (who had, in his own words, "fallen in love" with Radner after playing her son in a [[BC Hydro]] commercial on Canadian television and considered her the reason he wanted to be on ''SNL''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.talktalk.co.uk/entertainment/film/biography/artist/mike-myers/biography/86?page=2|title=Mike Myers biography|website=Talktalk.co.uk|accessdate=July 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; had not known how grave her situation was. Martin's planned opening monologue was scrapped; in its place Martin, in tears, introduced a video clip of a 1978 sketch in which he and Radner had parodied [[Fred Astaire]] and [[Cyd Charisse]] in a well-known dance routine from ''[[The Band Wagon]]'' (1953).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://vimeo.com/82820975|authors=Martin Steve &amp; Radner, Gilda|title=Saturday Night Live|date=1978|edition=Vimeo video|accessdate=March 20, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129085851/http://vimeo.com/82820975|archivedate=November 29, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the clip, Martin said it reminded him of "how great she was and of how young I looked. Gilda, we miss you."

Wilder established the Gilda Radner Hereditary Cancer Program&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cedars-sinai.edu/Patients/Programs-and-Services/Hereditary-Cancer-Program/|title=Hereditary Cancer Program (Gilda Radner Hereditary Cancer Program) - Cedars-Sinai|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Cedars-Sinai Medical Center|Cedars-Sinai]] to screen high-risk candidates (such as women of [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi Jewish descent]]) and to run basic diagnostic tests. He testified before a Congressional committee that Radner's condition had been misdiagnosed and that if doctors had inquired more deeply into her family background they would have learned that her grandmother, aunt, and cousin all died of ovarian cancer, and therefore they might have attacked the disease earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Wilder, Gene. "Why Did Gilda Die?" ''People Magazine'', June 3, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

Radner's death helped raise awareness of early detection of ovarian cancer and the connection to familial epidemiology.&lt;ref&gt;Squires, Sally. "Fighting Ovarian Cancer: Doctors Don't Know Who Is At Risk and Why", ''Washington Post'', May 30, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; The media attention in the two years after Radner's death led to registry of 450 families with familial ovarian cancer at the Familial Ovarian Cancer Registry, a research database registry at the [[Roswell Park Cancer Institute]] in Buffalo, New York. The registry was later renamed the Gilda Radner Familial Ovarian Cancer Registry (GRFOCR).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ovariancancer.com Gilda Radner Familial Ovarian Cancer Registry website]; accessed March 19, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, Gene Wilder and Registry founder Steven Piver, one of Radner's medical consultants, published ''Gilda's Disease: Sharing Personal Experiences and a Medical Perspective on Ovarian Cancer''.

In 1991, [[Gilda's Club]], a network of affiliate clubhouses where people living with cancer, their friends, and families, can meet to learn how to live with cancer, was founded by Joanna Bull, Radner's cancer [[Psychotherapy|psychotherapist]], along with Radner's widower, Gene Wilder (also a cancer survivor) and broadcaster [[Joel Siegel]] (who later died after a long battle with cancer). The first club opened in New York City in 1995. The organization took its name from Radner's comment that cancer gave her "membership to an elite club I'd rather not belong to".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gilda's Club Twin Cities: Who We Are|work=Website|publisher=gildasclubtwincities.org|url=http://www.gildasclubtwincities.org/whoweare/faqs|accessdate=November 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radner's story can be read in her book, ''It's Always Something''.&lt;ref name="something"/&gt;

Many Gilda's Clubs have opened across the United States and in Canada. In July 2009, Gilda's Club Worldwide merged with [[The Wellness Community]], another established cancer support organization to create the Cancer Support Community (CSC), which was legally adopted in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://journals.lww.com/oncology-times/Fulltext/2009/04100/Wellness_Community___Gilda_s_Club_May_Merge.5.aspx|title=Wellness Community &amp; Gilda's Club May Merge|work=Oncology Times vol 31, Issue 7|pages=8–10|accessdate=November 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.curetoday.com/index.cfm/fuseaction/blog.showIndex/susanmcclure/2009/12/14/Gildas-Club-and-The-Wellness-Community-Join-Forces|title=Gilda's Club and The Wellness Community Join Forces|first=Susan|last=McClure|date=December 14, 2009|accessdate=November 28, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121207185410/http://www.thenonprofittimes.com/article/detail/merging-to-increase-mission-impact-3966|archivedate=December 7, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenonprofittimes.com/article/detail/merging-to-increase-mission-impact-3966 |title=Merging to Increase Mission Impact |work=The NonProfit Times |accessdate=November 28, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121207185410/http://www.thenonprofittimes.com/article/detail/merging-to-increase-mission-impact-3966 |archivedate=December 7, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2012, more than 20 local affiliates of Gilda's Club were active. Although some local affiliates of Gilda's Club and The Wellness Community have retained their names, many affiliates have adopted the name Cancer Support Community following the merger.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}

In 2002, the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television network aired a television movie about her life: ''Gilda Radner: It's Always Something'', starring [[Jami Gertz]] as Radner.

In 2007, Radner was featured in ''Making Trouble'', a film tribute to female Jewish comedians, produced by the [[Jewish Women's Archive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Deming|first=Mark|title=Making Trouble: Three Generations of Funny Jewish Women|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/400302/Making-Trouble-Three-Generations-of-Funny-Jewish-Women/overview|accessdate=April 14, 2012|newspaper=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Radner makes two comic book appearances. DC Comics Young Love #122 in 1976 and Marvel Team-Up #74 from 1978.

==Awards and honors==
Radner won an [[Emmy Award]] for "Outstanding Continuing or Single Performance by a Supporting Actress in Variety or Music" for her performance on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in 1977. She posthumously won a [[Grammy Award]] for "Best Spoken Word Or Non-Musical Recording" in 1990.

In 1992, Radner was inducted into the [[Michigan Women's Hall of Fame]] for her achievements in arts and entertainment.  Through the generosity of many who participated in the 2002 ABC special, "Gilda Radner's Greatest Moments," (including Lynda Carter, Victor Garber, Eric Idle, David Letterman, Eugene Levy, Peter Mann, Steve Martin, Mike Myers, Paul Shaffer, Lily Tomlin and The Jim Henson Company), funds were raised to get Gilda a posthumous star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.  On June 27, 2003, she received a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6801 Hollywood Blvd.   "Saturday Night Live" alumna Molly Shannon (and the host of the ABC special) served as Master of Ceremonies at the induction at which Laraine Newman, Gilda's Club founder Joanna Bull and Gilda's brother Michael F. Radner also spoke to dedicate the honor.&lt;ref&gt;Friends of Gilda and Gilda's Club Worldwide&lt;/ref&gt;

Parts of West Houston Street in New York City, Lombard Street in Toronto, Kirk Road in Warminster, Pennsylvania, and Chester Avenue in White Plains, New York, have been renamed "Gilda Radner Way".
