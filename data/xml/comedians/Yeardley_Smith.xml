'''Martha Maria Yeardley Smith''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|j|ɑr|d|l|i}};&lt;ref name=name/&gt;) is an American actress, comedian and writer, best known for her long-running role as [[Lisa Simpson]] on the animated television series ''[[The Simpsons]]''.

She was born in [[Paris]] on July 3, 1964 and moved with her family to [[Washington, D.C.]], in 1966. As a child, Smith was often teased because of her voice. She became a professional actress in 1982 after graduating from drama school and moved to New York City in 1984, where she appeared in the Broadway production of [[Tom Stoppard]]'s ''[[The Real Thing (play)|The Real Thing]]''. She made her film debut in 1985's ''[[Heaven Help Us (film)|Heaven Help Us]]'', followed by roles in ''[[The Legend of Billie Jean]]'' and ''[[Maximum Overdrive]]''. She moved to Los Angeles in 1986 and received a recurring role in the television series ''[[Brothers (1984 TV series)|Brothers]]''. In 1987, she auditioned for a role in a series of [[The Simpsons shorts|animated short]]s about the [[Simpson family]] on ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]''. Smith intended to audition for the role of [[Bart Simpson]], but the casting director felt her voice was too high, so she was assigned the role of Lisa, instead. She voiced Lisa for three seasons on ''The Tracey Ullman Show'', and in 1989, [[The Simpsons shorts|the shorts]] were [[Spin-off (media)|spun off]] into their own half-hour show, ''[[The Simpsons]]''. For her work as the character, Smith received a [[Primetime Emmy Award]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance|Outstanding Voice-Over Performance]] in 1992.

Alongside ''The Simpsons'', Smith appeared in the sitcom ''[[Herman's Head]]'' as Louise, and had recurring appearances as Marlene on ''[[Dharma &amp; Greg]]'' and Penny in two episodes of ''[[Dead Like Me]]''. She has appeared in several films, including ''[[City Slickers]]'', ''[[Just Write]]'', ''[[Toys (film)|Toys]]'' and ''[[As Good as It Gets]]''. In 2004, Smith performed her own [[off-Broadway]] one-woman show entitled ''More'' at the [[Union Square Theatre]] in New York City. Aside from ''The Simpsons'', Smith has recorded few voice-over parts, only commercials and the film ''[[We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story (film)|We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story]]''. Smith starred in and served as executive producer for the independent romantic comedy ''Waiting For Ophelia'', which had its world premiere at the [[Phoenix Film Festival]] in April 2009.

Smith was married to actor Christopher Grove from 1990 to 1992 and Daniel Erickson from 2002 to 2008. She enjoys writing and painting. During the first season of ''Herman's Head'', Smith taught herself to paint by copying other artists. She released a children's book titled ''I, Lorelei'' in 2009 and her story "The Race" was included in the book ''Just Humor Me''.

==Early life==
Smith was born in Paris on July 3, 1964. Her father, Joseph Smith, worked for [[United Press International]] in Paris and moved to Washington, D.C., in 1966, where he became ''[[The Washington Post]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s first official obituary editor.&lt;ref name="Steps"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Two in one. Yeardley Smith is behind Lisa Simpson, but up front on 'Herman's Head'|work=[[The Knoxville News-Sentinel]] |date=February 26, 1992|author=Pickle, Betsy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother, Martha Mayor, was a [[conservation-restoration|paper conservator]] for the [[Freer Gallery of Art|Freer]] and [[Arthur M.

W. |last= Michion| pages= 20–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith has stated: "I've sounded pretty much the same way since I was six. Maybe [my voice is] a little deeper now."&lt;ref name=targum/&gt; She made her acting debut in a sixth-grade play.&lt;ref name=local/&gt;

==Career==

===Early career===
Smith became a professional actress in 1982 after graduating from drama school.&lt;ref name= local/&gt;&lt;ref name=austele/&gt; After appearances in a number of school plays, she joined the local [[Arena Stage]] theater group on an apprenticeship, featuring in their production of ''[[Peter and Wendy|Peter Pan]]''. She went on to star in several other plays in Washington.&lt;ref name=local/&gt; She moved to New York City in 1984 and appeared in the Broadway production of [[Tom Stoppard]]'s play ''[[The Real Thing (play)|The Real Thing]]'' alongside [[Jeremy Irons]] and [[Glenn Close]].&lt;ref name=love/&gt;&lt;ref name="Town"/&gt;

Smith's first film role came in ''[[Heaven Help Us (film)|Heaven Help Us]]'' (1985).&lt;ref name=love/&gt; She then played Putter in ''[[The Legend of Billie Jean]]'' (also 1985). The film was a [[box office bomb]] and critically panned, although Smith "thought it would be the movie that launched my career. And then it was out at the box office about 10 days before it died."&lt;ref name=targum/&gt; When filming was over, she rejoined ''The Real Thing'' before being out of work for six months. Smith worried her career was over.&lt;ref name=love/&gt; However, the following year, she played Connie in [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[Maximum Overdrive]]'' (1986), noting it was "truly a dreadful film, but I had a great part in it."&lt;ref name=love/&gt;

Smith moved to Los Angeles in 1986 on the "semi-promise" of a part in a TV film.&lt;ref name="Steps"/&gt;&lt;ref name=love/&gt; After the audition, the role was given to another actress. Smith realized "that people don't mean what they say. It's not malicious. They just don't realize how much impact they have on an impressionable actor – and all actors are impressionable." From then on, she decided to "just sort of build a wall around myself", to cope with the disappointment of not getting a part.&lt;ref name=love/&gt; In Los Angeles, Smith appeared in theatrical productions of ''Living on Salvation Street'', for which she was paid $14 for each performance,&lt;ref name= austele/&gt; ''Boys and Girls/Men and Women'', and ''[[How the Other Half Loves]]'', and played the recurring role of Louella Waters on the [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] series ''[[Brothers (1984 TV series)|Brothers]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Brothers on Showtime|url=http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/brothers/200260|work=[[TV Guide]]|accessdate=April 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; She appeared in the films ''The Legend of Billie Jean'' and ''[[Ginger Ale Afternoon]]'' (1989) as "trailer-park girls".&lt;ref name="Steps"/&gt; She later spoke of her regrets of appearing in the latter in her one-woman show ''More''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title= "The Simpsons" Actress Yeardley Smith Brings Her More to Los Angeles|last= Hernandez|first= Ernio|work= [[Playbill]]|url= http://www.playbill.com/news/article/90684-The_Simpsons_Actress_Yeardley_Smith_Brings_Her_More_to_Los_Angeles|archive-url= https://archive.is/20120911153338/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/90684-The_Simpsons_Actress_Yeardley_Smith_Brings_Her_More_to_Los_Angeles|dead-url= yes|archive-date= September 11, 2012|date= January 19, 2005|accessdate= May 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith's longest-running role is voicing [[Lisa Simpson]] on ''The Simpsons''. She has voiced Lisa since 1987, beginning with ''[[The Simpsons shorts]]'' on ''The Tracey Ullman Show''. Smith had initially been asked to audition for the role of Lisa's brother [[Bart Simpson|Bart]], but casting director [[Bonita Pietila]] thought her voice was too high. Smith later recalled "I always sounded too much like a girl, I read two lines as Bart and they said, 'Thanks for coming!'"&lt;ref name=austele/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1565538/20070725/story.jhtml |title='Simpsons' Trivia, From Swearing Lisa To 'Burns-Sexual' Smithers |accessdate=July 29, 2007 |date=October 26, 2008 |first=Larry |last=Carroll |publisher=MTV |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071220140402/http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1565538/20070725/story.jhtml |archivedate=December 20, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith was given the role of Lisa, instead.

Commentary for "[[Missionary: Impossible]]", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Eleventh Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt; Smith spends two days a week recording the show.&lt;ref name=guard/&gt;

Until 1998, Smith was paid $30,000 per episode. During a pay dispute in 1998, Fox threatened to replace the six main voice actors with new actors, going as far as preparing to cast new voices.&lt;ref name=Glaister/&gt; However, the dispute was soon resolved and she received $125,000 per episode until 2004, when the voice actors demanded that they be paid $360,000 an episode.&lt;ref name=Glaister&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/04/02/1080544690429.html|title=Simpsons actors demand bigger share|accessdate=February 10, 2009|date=April 3, 2004|author=Glaister, Dan|publisher=''The Age''}}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue was resolved a month later,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/05/01/entertainment/main615066.shtml|title='Simpsons' Cast Goes Back To Work|accessdate=February 10, 2009|date=May 1, 2004|publisher=[[CBS News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Smith earned $250,000 per episode.&lt;ref name="Sheridan"/&gt; After salary renegotiations in 2008, the voice actors received about $400,000 per episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Simpsons cast sign new pay deal | publisher = [[BBC News]] | date = June 3, 2008 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7434296.stm | accessdate=February 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later, with Fox threatening to cancel the series unless production costs were cut, Smith and the other cast members accepted a 25% pay cut, down to just over $300,000 per episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last= Block| first= Alex Ben|title='The Simpsons' Renewed for Two More Seasons| url= http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/simpsons-renewed-two-more-seasons-245748|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate=October 15, 2011|date=October 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Yeardley Smith 2012.png|thumb|Smith at the [[At Long Last Leave#Promotion|''Simpsons'' 500th Episode Marathon]], February 2012]]
Despite her world-famous role, Smith is rarely recognized in public, which she does not mind, saying, "it's wonderful to be in the midst of all this hype about the show, and people enjoying the show so much, and to be totally a [[fly on the wall]]; people never recognise me solely from my voice."&lt;ref name="Sheridan"&gt;{{cite news|title=Meet the Simpsons|date=May 6, 2004|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|Daily Express]]| first=Peter |last= Sheridan}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2009 interview with ''[[The Guardian]]'', she commented: "It's the best job ever. I have nothing but gratitude for the amount of freedom ''The Simpsons'' has bought me in my life."&lt;ref name=guard&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/jan/16/lisa-simpson-yeardley-smith-film |title= From Springfield to Tinseltown|date=January 16, 2009|first= Lisa |last= Marks|work=[[The Guardian]]| accessdate=February 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith received a [[Primetime Emmy Award]] in 1992, but felt it was not worth anything, saying "there's part of me that feels it wasn't even a real Emmy." The Emmy for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance|Outstanding Voice-Over Performance]] is a [[Creative Arts Emmy Award|Creative Arts]] and not handed out during the primetime telecast and, prior to 2009, was a juried award without nominations.&lt;ref name="Happy"&gt;{{cite news| title=She's happy as Lisa Simpson, although she'd like more d'oh |date=April 4, 2004|work=[[The Spokesman-Review]]|publisher=Associated Press|first=Heidi | last= Vogt}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Smith says "if I had to be associated with one character in fiction, I will always be thrilled that it was Lisa Simpson."&lt;ref name="Happy"/&gt; The show's creator [[Matt Groening]] has called Smith very similar to Lisa: "Yeardley has strong moral views about her character. There are lines that are written for Lisa that Yeardley reads and says, 'No, I wouldn't say that.{{'"}}&lt;ref name=love/&gt; Writer [[Jay Kogen]] praised her performance on the show, particularly in the episode "[[Lisa's Substitute]]", as able "to move past comedy to something really strong and serious and dramatic."&lt;ref name=love/&gt;

===Further career===
From 1991 to 1994, alongside ''The Simpsons'', Smith was one of the lead cast members in the sitcom ''[[Herman's Head]]'' as Louise.&lt;ref name=local&gt;{{cite news|title=Local actress finds a voice in 'Simpsons'|date=November 20, 1994|work=[[The Washington Times]]|first=Paul|last=Freeman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her other television roles include recurring appearances as Marlene on ''[[Dharma &amp; Greg]]'', and Penny in two episodes of ''[[Dead Like Me]]''. Smith has also appeared in ''[[Phil of the Future]]'' and ''[[Teen Angel (1997 TV series)|Teen Angel]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?id=6653|title=Development update – July 12–13|work=The Futon Critic| date= July 13, 2004| accessdate=April 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her one-scene role as pregnant checkout girl Nancy in 1991's ''[[City Slickers]]'' earned her "more attention than all [her] previous roles combined", and taught her "that it's far better to have small parts in big movies that everyone sees."&lt;ref name=targum/&gt; In 1997, she appeared as Lulu the palm reader in the independent film ''[[Just Write]]''.&lt;ref name=targum/&gt; Her other roles include parts in [[Barry Levinson]]'s ''[[Toys (film)|Toys]]'' and [[James L. Brooks]]' ''[[As Good as It Gets]]''.&lt;ref name="Steps"/&gt; Brooks, who is also executive producer of ''The Simpsons'', had cast Smith in his 1994 film ''[[I'll Do Anything]]'' (in one of the film's musical numbers), but her part was cut.&lt;ref name=targum/&gt; Aside from ''The Simpsons'', Smith has recorded few voice-over parts, only commercials and the film ''[[We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story (film)|We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story]]''. She "had a voice-over agent for about two years, and I used to go out [on auditions] all the time, but it never really came to anything. Everybody said, 'Oh Yeardley, you'll clean up,' and that was definitely not the case."&lt;ref name=love/&gt;

In 2004, Smith performed her own off-Broadway one-woman show entitled ''More'' at the [[Union Square Theatre]] in New York City. Directed by [[Judith Ivey]],&lt;ref name="More"/&gt; the play is about her mixed feelings over the success of ''The Simpsons'', her parents, her relationships, and her struggles with [[bulimia]].&lt;ref name="Steps"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE7D71731F934A25750C0A9629C8B63|title=Lisa Simpson's Voice Steps Out on Her Own |author=Gates, Anita|accessdate=October 26, 2008|date=March 17, 2004|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Happy"/&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' critic Margo Jefferson called it an "appealing if overlong show", adding that "The career narrative needed shortening. This would involve some editing and revising but wouldn't taint the best parts of ''More.'' It is refreshing to hear a celebrity talk cleanly about being fame-driven and about not getting the degree or the kind of fame you craved. It's fun to watch a skilled actress use her craft to the full."&lt;ref name="More"&gt;{{Cite web|author=Jefferson, Margo|work=The New York Times|title=Theater review; What Do I Want?

Smith starred in and served as executive producer for the independent romantic comedy ''Waiting for Ophelia'', which was released in 2009. She funded the film, which was written by Adam Carl and based on a stage play he wrote in 2003. She said: "I loved it. I never get to play parts like that. I always play the friend of a friend, never the lead. And the script surprised me."
