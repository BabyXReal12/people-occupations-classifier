'''William Sasso''' (born May 24, 1975) is a [[Canadian-American]] actor, comedian and podcaster on his podcast Ten Minute Podcast. Most notable for his five seasons as a cast member on ''[[MADtv]]'' from 1997 to 2002 and for starring as [[Curly Howard|Curly]] in the 2012 film reboot of ''[[The Three Stooges (2012 film)|The Three Stooges]]''.

==Early life==
Sasso was born in [[Ladner, British Columbia]], to Italian immigrants.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Citation|last=Ten Minute Podcast|title=Ten Minute Podcast - 285 - Setting Parameters|date=2017-06-07|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPppzEZ7us4|accessdate=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from Delta Secondary School in [[Delta, British Columbia]] in 1993. He credits his determination to become an actor and his respect for comedy to an "unhealthy [[Behavioral addiction|addiction]] to television".{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==Career==
At the age of 15 he landed his first agent and quickly began booking roles in television and film. Before moving from [[Vancouver]] to [[Los Angeles|Los Angeles, California]], Sasso starred for five seasons as quirky teen Derek Wakaluk on the award-winning Canadian dramatic series ''[[Madison (TV series)|Madison]]''.

===''MADtv''===
By the end of its second season (1996–1997), ''MADtv'' experienced its first big cast turnover. Three of the show's repertory performers ([[Bryan Callen]], [[Orlando Jones]] and [[Artie Lange]]) left the cast. As a result, in 1997, casting executives at FOX had to cast replacements for the show. Sasso (along with [[Alex Borstein]] and [[Aries Spears]]) was selected to join the ''MADtv'' third season cast as a regular cast member. Upon his exit, MADtv became known as "The House that Sasso Built."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Sasso is known for quirky characters such as the accident-prone handyman Paul Timberman, Eracist member Hugh, singer Michael McCloud, ''Talkin' American'' host Rui Peranio and Mexican [[Lucha libre|luchador]] Señor Bag of Crap.

Sasso also does many celebrity impersonations, including impersonations of:

* [[Alan Hale, Jr.]] (as The Skipper from ''[[Gilligan’s Island]]'')
* [[Anthony Hopkins]] (as [[Hannibal Lector]])
* [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]
* [[Bert Lahr]] (as the [[Cowardly Lion]] from ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'')
* [[Bill Clinton]]

Will began developing several network television projects with [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]/[[Touchstone Pictures|Touchstone]] for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in 2001 and in 2002, Sasso left ''MADtv'' to pursue the next stage of his career.

===Professional wrestling===
Sasso is a [[professional wrestling]] fan, and has made appearances with multiple American pro wrestling [[Professional wrestling promotion|promotions]].

Sasso engaged in a [[Shoot (professional wrestling)#Worked shoots|worked shoot]] [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#A|angle]] with former world champion wrestler [[Bret Hart]], which began on February 6, 1999 during Hart's second guest appearance on ''MADtv''. In a sketch lampooning the election of [[Jesse Ventura]] to gubernatorial office, Hart "[[Breaking character|broke character]]" and attacked the cast members for making light of wrestling, apparently injuring Sasso. He then appeared in a later episode at the [[curtain call]] during the ending credits and again attacked Sasso in an "unscripted" assault. Sasso then appeared at ringside during the February 8, 1999 episode of ''[[WCW Monday Nitro]]'', where Hart again attacked him. Sasso retaliated by interfering in Hart's match against [[Roddy Piper]], making him lose the match and the [[WWE United States Championship|WCW United States Championship]]. This led to a grudge match on the February 15, 1999 episode of ''Nitro'', where Sasso appeared with castmate [[Debra Wilson]], who turned on Sasso, making it a one-sided match.

Sasso's impersonation of [[Stone Cold Steve Austin|Steve Austin]] impressed the [[WWE|WWF]] (as it was then still known, before its name changed to WWE) so much that they asked him to be part of the February 7, 2002 episode of ''[[WWE Friday Night SmackDown|WWF SmackDown!]]'', appearing alongside [[Chris Jericho]] and Austin himself, as a means to promote Austin's upcoming "MADtv" appearance.

On the live April 9, 2012 broadcast of WWE Raw, he appeared along with the other actors in ''[[The Three Stooges (2012 film)|The Three Stooges]]'' movie, alternating between [[Curly Howard|Curly]] and [[Hulk Hogan]] impersonations. He was chokeslammed by Kane.

Sasso also appeared on a ''[[WWE Main Event]]'' promo for [[Dolph Ziggler]].

===Recent years===
Since leaving ''[[MADtv]]'', Sasso's television appearances include four seasons as Carl Monari on ''[[Less than Perfect]]'', as well as a role in ''[[Robson Arms]]''. Sasso also played the role of Fortunio Balducci in ''[[Southland Tales]]''. Sasso starred in ''[[$h*! My Dad Says]]'', based on the [[Twitter]] feed [[Shit My Dad Says]] created by Justin Halpern. The show premiered in the fall of 2010 and its cancellation was announced on May 15, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.cbspressexpress.com/div.php/cbs_entertainment/release?id=25083 |title= CBS Announces 2010-2011 Primetime Schedule|publisher= CBS Television Network|date=May 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2011/05/15/the-defenders-s-my-dad-says-and-mad-love-canceled-by-cbs/92704/&lt;/ref&gt;

He also appeared in the 2002 [[Sum 41]] [[music video]] "[[Still Waiting (Sum 41 song)|Still Waiting]]" as the manager for the band.

Sasso hosted the 2006 [[Canadian Comedy Awards]] in [[London, Ontario]] as well as the festival's "Sketch &amp; Improv Showcases". Additionally, he was a host at the 2005-2006 [[National Hockey League|NHL]] award ceremony. Sasso appeared on the ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation|CSI]]'' episode "The Chick Chop Flick Shop". He also appeared in the ''[[Childrens Hospital]]'' episode "Frankfurters".

From February 20, 2012 to April 12, 2018 Sasso hosted the ''Ten Minute Podcast'' with [[Bryan Callen]] and [[Chris D'Elia]] (who were later replaced by [[Tommy Blacha]] and [[Chad Kultgen]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://tenminutepodcast.com/&lt;/ref&gt;  He has also appeared on [[The Fighter &amp; The Kid Podcast]] several times.

Sasso began posting on [[Vine (service)|Vine]], creating a running gag of being uncontrollably able to reproduce lemons out of his mouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/23/will-sassos-vines-chronicle-his-battle-with-lemons_n_2941094.html | work=Huffington Post | title=WATCH: It Is Impossible Not To Laugh At This | date=March 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he posts videos in characters impersonating the likes of [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], [[Bill Cosby]], [[Hulk Hogan]] and [[Robert De Niro]]. As of September 2014, he has two million followers.&lt;ref&gt;https://vine.co/WillSasso&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, Sasso plays Mountie Archambault in the 2018 Movie [[Super Troopers 2]].
