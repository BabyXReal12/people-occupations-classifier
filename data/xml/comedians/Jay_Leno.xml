After doing stand-up comedy for years, he became the host of [[NBC]]'s ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'' from 1992 to 2009. Beginning in September 2009, Leno started a primetime talk show, titled ''[[The Jay Leno Show]]'', which aired weeknights at 10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time|ET]], also on NBC.

After ''The Jay Leno Show'' was canceled in January 2010 amid a [[2010 Tonight Show conflict|host controversy]], Leno returned to host ''The Tonight Show with Jay Leno'' on March 1, 2010.&lt;ref name="thewrap"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thewrap.com/ind-column/new-nbc-breaking-story-13241 |title=Exclusive: Conan, NBC Officially Splitsville (Updated) |first=Josef |last=Adalian |date=January 21, 2010 |work=The Wrap |accessdate=January 21, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He hosted his last episode of ''The Tonight Show'' on February 6, 2014.

==Early life==
Leno was born April 28, 1950 in [[New Rochelle, New York|New Rochelle]], New York. His homemaker mother, Catherine (née Muir; 1911–1993), was born in [[Greenock]], Scotland, and came to the United States at age 11. His father, Angelo (1910–1994), was an insurance salesman who was born in New York, to immigrants from [[Flumeri]], Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=May 11, 2008|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/70/Jay-Leno.html|title=Jay Leno Biography (1950–)|publisher=Film Reference}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leno grew up in [[Andover, Massachusetts]], and graduated from [[Andover High School (Massachusetts)|Andover High School]].&lt;ref&gt;"Andover Biography-- Jay Leno." Memorial Hall Library Andover (MA). [http://answers.mhl.org/Andover_Biography_-_Jay_Leno].&lt;/ref&gt;  Leno obtained a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[speech therapy]] from [[Emerson College]], where he started a comedy club in 1973.&lt;ref name="carter20090912" /&gt; His older brother, Patrick (May 12, 1940 – October 6, 2002),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ancientfaces.com/person/patrick-leno/13503472|title=Patrick Leno|work=AncientFaces}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Vietnam War]] veteran who worked as an attorney.

==Career==

===Early career===
Leno made his first appearance on ''The Tonight Show'' on March 2, 1977, performing a comedy routine.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|rxmXpzcl4MI|Jay Leno's First Appearance on the Tonight Show}} March 2, 1977. Retrieved June 28, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbc.com/the-tonight-show/about/bio/cast/jay-leno/587494/ Jay Leno Bio] NBC.

After an uncredited appearance in the 1977 film ''[[Fun with Dick and Jane (1977 film)|Fun with Dick and Jane]]'', he played more prominent roles in 1978 in ''[[American Hot Wax]]'' and ''[[Silver Bears]]''. Other films and television series from that period include ''Almost Heaven'' (1978), "Going Nowhere" (1979) from ''[[One Day at a Time]]'', ''[[Americathon]]'' (1979), ''[[Polyester (film)|Polyester]]'' (1981), "The Wild One" (1981) from ''[[Alice (TV series)|Alice]]'', and both "Feminine Mistake" (1979) and "Do the Carmine" (1983) from ''[[Laverne &amp; Shirley]]''. Leno's only starring film role was the 1989 direct-to-video ''[[Collision Course (1989 film)|Collision Course]]'', opposite [[Pat Morita]]. He also appeared numerous times on ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]''.

===''The Tonight Show''===
[[File:Jay Leno (1993) by Alan Light.jpg|thumb|upright|right|200px|Leno in 1993, in the year after becoming host of ''The Tonight Show'']]
Starting in 1987, Leno was a regular substitute host for [[Johnny Carson]] on ''[[The Tonight Show]]''. In 1992, he replaced Carson as host&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Carson cuts appearances|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=NQMIAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=SzYDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5008,192179&amp;dq=tonight+jay-leno+shandling|agency=Associated Press|work=Rome News-Tribune|location=Rome, Ga.|page=14|date=June 2, 1987|accessdate=October 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; amid controversy with [[David Letterman]], who had been hosting ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'' since 1982 (aired after ''The Tonight Show''), and whom many—including Carson himself—had expected to be Carson's successor. The story of this turbulent transition was later turned into [[The Late Shift (book)|a book]] and [[The Late Shift (film)|a movie]]. Leno continued to perform as a stand-up comedian throughout his tenure on ''The Tonight Show''.

In 2004, Leno signed a contract extension with [[NBC]] which would keep him as host of ''The Tonight Show'' until 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NBC signs Jay Leno to contract extension|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2004-03-30-leno-contract-extended_x.htm |agency=Associated Press|work=USA Today|date=March 31, 2004|accessdate=October 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 2004, [[Conan O'Brien]] signed a contract with NBC under which O'Brien would become the host of ''The Tonight Show'' in 2009, replacing Leno at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Bill|last=Carter|title=Conan O'Brien to Succeed Jay Leno in 2009, NBC Announces|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/27/business/media/28CND-NBC.html?pagewanted=print&amp;position= |work=The New York Times|date=September 27, 2004|accessdate=October 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike]], Leno was accused of violating WGA guidelines by writing his own monologue for ''The Tonight Show''. While NBC and Leno claim there were private meetings with the WGA where there was a secret agreement allowing this, the WGA denied such a meeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=May 11, 2008|url=http://www.deadlinehollywooddaily.com/lenowga-whats-the-real-story-nbc-claims-jay-asked-for-received-wga-permission-to-write-monologue-at-monday-meeting-with-verrone-et-al/|title=LENO/WGA: WHAT'S THE REAL STORY? NBC Claims Jay Asked For &amp; Received WGA Permission To Write Monologue At Secret Monday Meeting With Verrone|publisher=Deadline Hollywood Daily}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leno answered questions in front of the [[Writers Guild of America, West]] trial committee in February 2009 and June 2009, and when the WGAW published its list of strike-breakers on August 11, 2009, Leno was not on the list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2009/08/guild-clears-jay-leno-of-violating-strike-rules.html | title = WGA: No chin music for Jay Leno | work = Company Town | first = Richard | last = Verrier | publisher = [[Los Angeles Times]] | date = August 11, 2009 | accessdate = August 14, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118007189.html?categoryId=2821&amp;cs=1 | title = Jay Leno cleared of strike violations; WGA West issues penalties in three cases | first = Cynthia | last = Littleton | date = August 11, 2009 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | location = New York City | publisher = [[Reed Business Information]] | accessdate = August 14, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leno said in 2008 that he was saving all of his income from ''The Tonight Show'' and living solely off his income from stand-up comedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2008-07-16-leno-cover_N.htm|title=Jay Leno Gears up for Life After 'Tonight'|last=della Cava|first=Marco|date=July 17, 2008|work=USA Today|accessdate=April 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 23, 2009, Leno checked himself into a hospital with an undisclosed illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://edition.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/TV/04/23/leno.hospitalized/index.html | title = Jay Leno hospitalized; 'Tonight Show' tapings canceled | first = Jack | last = Hannah | work = [[CNN.com]] | date = April 23, 2009 | publisher = [[Cable News Network]] | accessdate = August 14, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was released the following day and returned to work on Monday, April 27. The two subsequently cancelled ''Tonight Show'' episodes for April 23 and 24 were Leno's first in 17 years as host.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/2009/04/24/2009-04-24_rep_jay_leno_hospital_trip_precautionary_late_night_host_to_be_released_friday.html|title=Jay Leno released from the hospital|publisher=NYDailyNews|accessdate=April 24, 2009 | location=New York | first=Nancy | last=Dillon | date=April 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cacom-reuters"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.canada.com/News/Leno+misses+first+show+years/1530668/story.html |title=Jay Leno misses first show in 17 years |agency=[[Reuters]] |date=April 24, 2009 |work=[[Canada.com]] |publisher=[[Canwest Publishing Inc.]] |location=[[Winnipeg]], Manitoba |accessdate=August 14, 2009 }}{{dead link|date=September 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the illness that caused the absence was not disclosed, but later Leno told People magazine that the ailment was exhaustion.&lt;ref name="cacom-reuters" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20276256,00.html | title = Jay Leno Reveals Mystery Ailment: Exhaustion | date = May 1, 2009 | work = [[People.com]] | first = Pamela | last = Warrick | publisher = [[Time Inc.]] | accessdate = August 14, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Michael Jackson trial====
During the [[Trial of Michael Jackson|2005 trial of Michael Jackson]] over allegations of child molestation, Leno was one of a few celebrities who appeared as a defense witness. In his testimony regarding a call by the accuser, Leno testified that he never called the police, that no money was asked for, and there was no coaching – but that the calls seemed unusual and scripted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=May 11, 2008|url=http://www.courttv.com/trials/jackson/052405_ctv.html|title=Comedians Jay Leno and Chris Tucker testify for Michael Jackson|publisher=[[Court TV]]|date=May 24, 2005|author=Sweetingham, Lisa |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080315195750/http://www.courttv.com/trials/jackson/052405_ctv.html |archivedate= March 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:JayLeno.jpg|thumb|right|Leno in 2006]]
As a result, Leno was initially not allowed to tell jokes about Jackson or the case, which had been a fixture of ''The Tonight Show''{{'}}s opening monologue in particular. But he and his show's writers used a legal loophole by having Leno briefly step aside while stand-in comedians took the stage and told jokes about the trial. Stand-ins included [[Roseanne Barr]], [[Drew Carey]], [[Brad Garrett]], and [[Dennis Miller]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|accessdate=May 11, 2008|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0503/08/sbt.01.html|title=Nemcova Speaks Out on Surviving Tsunami; Michael Jackson`s Trial Continues; Interview With Kevin Costner |series=[[Showbiz Tonight]]|publisher=CNN|airdate=March 8, 2005|first=Karyn|last=Bryant}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gag order was challenged, and the court ruled that Leno could continue telling jokes about the trial as long as he did not discuss his testimony. Leno celebrated by devoting an entire monologue to Michael Jackson jokes.

===Succession by Conan O'Brien and ''The Jay Leno Show''===
{{Main article|The Jay Leno Show}}
Because Leno's show continued to lead all late-night programming in the [[Nielsen ratings]], the pending expiration of Leno's contract led to speculation about whether he would become a late-night host for another network after his commitment to NBC expired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Frazier |last=Moore |title=NBC's Jay Leno-Conan O'Brien swap prompts rumors |url=http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/fanfare/nbc-s-jay-leno-conan-o-brien-swap-prompts-rumors-1.881678 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216165209/http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/fanfare/nbc-s-jay-leno-conan-o-brien-swap-prompts-rumors-1.881678 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=December 16, 2013 |agency=Associated Press |work=Newsday |date=May 14, 2008 |accessdate=June 28, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Leno left ''The Tonight Show'' on Friday, May 29, 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Bill|last=Carter|title=Date Is Set for Leno's 'Tonight' Finale|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/22/arts/television/22late.html?n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/Subjects/T/Television|work=The New York Times|date=July 22, 2008|accessdate=October 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/30/arts/television/30leno.html?em|title=Jay Leno Takes Final Bow on 'Tonight Show' |date=May 30, 2009|work=The New York Times|accessdate=May 30, 2009 | first=Bill | last=Carter}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Conan O'Brien took over on June 1, 2009.

On December 8, 2008, it was reported that Leno would remain on NBC and move to a new hour-long show at 10 p.m. Eastern Time (9 p.m. Central Time) five nights a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/09/business/media/09leno.html?em|title = Where Is Leno Going?

''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien|Late Night]]'' host [[Conan O'Brien]] was his successor on ''The Tonight Show''.&lt;ref name=CNNLeno&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/SHOWBIZ/TV/07/21/tv.nbc.tonight.ap/index.html|title=Leno's last 'Tonight' announced|accessdate=July 21, 2008|agency=Associated Press|authorlink=Associated Press|date=July 21, 2008|work=CNN.com|quote=Leno's last show was Friday, May 29, and O'Brien started the following Monday, June 1, NBC executives told a Television Critics Association meeting Monday. |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080724101827/http://www.cnn.com/2008/SHOWBIZ/TV/07/21/tv.nbc.tonight.ap/index.html |archivedate = July 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jay Leno's new show, titled ''The Jay Leno Show'', debuted on September 14, 2009. It was announced at the [[Television Critics Association]] summer press tour that it would feature one or two celebrities, the occasional musical guest, and keep the popular "Headlines" segments, which would air near the end of the show. First guests included [[Jerry Seinfeld]], [[Oprah Winfrey]] (via satellite), and a short sit-down with [[Kanye West]] discussing his controversy at the [[2009 MTV Video Music Awards]], which had occurred the night before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvshark.com/read/?art=arc3888|title=Pop Minute - Jay Leno Reveals What To Expect From His New Primetime Show|work=tvshark.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Timeslot conflict and return to ''The Tonight Show''===
{{wikinews|US TV host Conan O'Brien rejects NBC's offer to switch his show's time slot}}
{{main article|2010 Tonight Show conflict}}
In their new roles, neither O'Brien nor Leno succeeded in delivering the viewing audiences the network anticipated. On January 7, 2010, multiple media outlets reported that beginning March 1, 2010, Jay Leno would move from his 10 p.m. weeknight time slot to 11:35&amp;nbsp;p.m., due to a combination of pressure from local affiliates whose newscasts were suffering, and both Leno's and O'Brien's poor ratings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2010/01/future-for-nbcs-the-jay-leno-show-is-up-in-the-air.html |title= Future For NBC's Tonight Show Up In The Air| work= [[Los Angeles Times]]'' blog''| date= January 2010| access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= access&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.accesshollywood.com/articles/jay-leno-heading-back-to-late-night-conan-obrien-weighing-options-80698/ | website= accesshollywood.com| title= Jay Leno Heading Back To Late Night, Conan O’Brien Weighing Options| date= January 8, 2010| access-date= January 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leno's show would be shortened from an hour to 30 minutes. All NBC late night programming would be preempted by the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] between February 15 and 26. This would move ''The Tonight Show'' to 12:05&amp;nbsp;a.m., a post-midnight timeslot for the first time in its history.

On January 21, it was announced that NBC had struck a deal with O'Brien. It was decided that O'Brien would leave ''The Tonight Show''.

===Criticism of Leno===
[[File:Jaylenocropped.jpg|right|thumb|Leno on ''The Tonight Show'' in 2005]]
Leno has faced heated criticism and some negative publicity for his perceived role in the [[2010 Tonight Show conflict|2010 ''Tonight Show'' conflict]].&lt;ref name="wsj11510"&gt;[https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2010/01/15/why-some-comics-arent-laughing-at-jay-leno-essay/ "Why Some Comics Aren’t Laughing at Jay Leno"].

''Digital Journal''&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Leno stated he did not want O'Brien to leave for a competing network, adding, "I'll be 59 when [the switch occurs], that's five years from now. There's really only one person who could have done this into his 60s, and that was [[Johnny Carson]]; I think it's fair to say I'm no Johnny Carson."&lt;ref name="dj11710" /&gt; Leno also described ''The Tonight Show'' as a [[dynasty]], saying, "You hold it and hand it off to the next person. And I don't want to see all the fighting." At the end of the segment, he said, "Conan, it's yours! See you in five years, buddy!"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/6d1caacad1/jay-s-2004-announcement "2004 Tonight Show Clip: 'Conan, It's yours!{{'"}}] [[Funny or Die]].&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Bill Zehme, the co-author of Leno's autobiography ''Leading with My Chin'', told the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', "The thing Leno should do is walk, period. He's got everything to lose in terms of public popularity by going back. People will look at him differently.

[[Howard Stern]] has also been a harsh critic of Leno before and following his ''Tonight Show'' timeslot change announcement;&lt;ref name="stern"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ2fZH2XqNw&amp;feature=related "Rosie O'Donnell Slams Jay Leno (Part 1 of 2)"]; [[YouTube]]; January 14, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Stern appeared on ''Late Night with Conan O'Brien'' in 2006, and told O'Brien that he felt it was unlikely that Leno would ever willingly give up ''The Tonight Show'' to anyone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://talkshownews.interbridge.com/2010/01/howard-stern-to-conan-in-2006-i-dont.html "Howard Stern to Conan in 2006: 'I don't see this guy leaving"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100221232040/http://talkshownews.interbridge.com/2010/01/howard-stern-to-conan-in-2006-i-dont.html |date=February 21, 2010 }} Talk Show News; January 15, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; During the conflict, Stern made many negative remarks directed at Leno while on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=FISHER|first1=LUCHINA|title=Howard Stern Gets in Another Dig at Leno|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/story?id=7793427|website=ABC News|accessdate=30 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to criticism about his handling of the timeslot conflict, Leno has also been criticized for the perceived change in the content of his monologues from his previous stand-up material. Actor and comedian [[Patton Oswalt]] was among the celebrities who openly voiced disappointment with Leno, saying, "Comedians who don't like Jay Leno now, and I'm one of them, we're not like, 'Jay Leno sucks'; it's that we're so hurt and disappointed that one of the best comedians of our generation... willfully has shut the switch off."&lt;ref name="huffpost"&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/01/11/patton-oswalt-weighs-in-o_n_419015.html "Patton Oswalt: Jay Leno Is Like Nixon, I Don't Like Him"]. ''[[The Huffington Post]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Support for Leno===
[[NBC Sports]] chairman and former ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' producer [[Dick Ebersol]] spoke out against all who had mocked Leno, calling them "chicken-hearted and gutless".&lt;ref name="latimes11510"&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-leno-backlash16-2010jan16,0,4645138.story "Taking on America's 'nice guy{{'"}}]. ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Jeff Gaspin, then chairman of NBC Universal Television Entertainment, also defended Leno, saying, "This has definitely crossed the line. Jay Leno is the consummate professional and one of the hardest-working people in television. It's a shame that he's being pulled into this."&lt;ref name="latimes11510-2" /&gt; Fellow comedians [[Paul Reiser]], [[Jerry Seinfeld]] and [[Jim Norton (American comedian)|Jim Norton]] (a frequent contributor to ''The Tonight Show'') also voiced support for Leno.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/paul-reiser/a-teachable-leno-moment_b_418197.html "Paul Reiser: A Teachable Moment"].

Responding to the mounting criticism, Leno said that NBC had assured him that O'Brien was willing to accept the proposed arrangement and that they would not let either host out of his contract.&lt;ref name="e11810"&gt;[http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/b162674_jay_tries_make_nice_conan_rallies_troops.html "Jay Leno Tries to Make Nice, While Conan Rallies the Troops"]. ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Leno also said that the situation was "all business", and that all of the decisions were made by NBC.&lt;ref name="e11810" /&gt; He appeared on the January 28, 2010, episode of ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' in an attempt to repair some of the damage done to his public image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Marikar|first=Sheila|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/jay-leno-tells-oprah-winfrey-conan-obriens-tonight/story?id=9687814|title=Jay Leno Tells Oprah Winfrey Conan O'Brien's Exit Wasn't His Fault|date=January 28, 2009|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=January 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead, he lives off his money from his stand-up routines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://parade.com/49910/jayleno/jay-leno-persistance-pays-off/ |title= Jay Leno|first= Jay |last= Leno|work= [[Parade (magazine)|Parade]] | date= September 6, 2009| access-date= January 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-12-most-frugal-celebrities-184410272.html|title=The 12 Most Frugal Celebrities |first= Kirsten| last=Acuna| website= finance.yahoo.com |publisher=[[Business Insider]]|date=March 8, 2013|accessdate=April 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leno reportedly earned $32 million in 2005.&lt;ref name="forbes"&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.forbes.com/lists/2006/53/207B.html |work= [[Forbes]]| title= The Top 100 Celebrities: Jay Leno: Talking head| date= 2006| access-date= January 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, he received an [[Honorary degree|Honorary]] [[Doctor of Humane Letters]] degree from [[Emerson College]] where he also delivered the [[Commencement speech]].  &lt;ref&gt;http://www.emerson.edu/videos/jay-leno-2014-emerson-college-commencement-address&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charity===
In 2001, along with his wife, he donated $100,000 to the [[Feminist Majority Foundation]]'s campaign to stop [[gender apartheid]] in Afghanistan, to educate the public regarding the plight of women in Afghanistan under [[Taliban]] rule. Mavis Leno is on the board of the Feminist Majority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hollywood's Latest Cause: Can A Pack Of Celebrities Save Afghanistan's Women? |work= [[Newsweek]] |date=December 6, 1999 |url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/90455/output/print |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090410150936/http://www.newsweek.com/id/90455/output/print |archivedate=April 10, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = So Many Causes, So Little Time | first = Susan H.| last = Greenberg| work= Newsweek| date = February 20, 2000| url = http://www.newsweek.com/id/82834| access-date= January 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, he donated $100,000 to a scholarship fund at [[Salem State University|Salem State College]] (now Salem State University) in honor of Lennie Sogoloff, who gave Leno his start at his jazz club, Lennie's-on-the-Turnpike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |accessdate= November 29, 2009 |url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2009/04/12/leno_says_thanks_with_100k_check |title=Leno says thanks with $100k check |publisher=[[Boston Herald]] |date=April 12, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110604121114/http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2009/04/12/leno_says_thanks_with_100k_check |archivedate=June 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2012, Leno auctioned his [[Fiat 500]], which was sold for $385,000 with all the proceeds going to a charity that helps wounded war veterans recover by providing them with temporary housing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Distant|first=Daniel|title=Jay Leno's Fiat 500 Sold for $385,000 to House Wounded Veterans|url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/jay-lenos-fiat-500-sold-for-385000-to-house-wounded-veterans-80276/|work=[[The Christian Post]]|accessdate=April 24, 2013|date=August 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vehicle collection===

Leno owns approximately 286 vehicles (169 automobiles and 117 motorcycles).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jaylenosgarage.com/the-cars/ The Cars], jaylenosgarage.com&lt;/ref&gt; He also has a website and a TV show called ''[[Jay Leno's Garage]]'', which contains video clips and photos of his automobiles in detail, as well as other vehicles of interest to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.jaylenosgarage.com|title = Jay Leno's Garage|website= jaylenosgarage.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leno's Garage Manager is Bernard Juchli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://totalcarmagazine.com/features/2013/04/06/ja_leno_garage_pt1/|title = Which way to Jay Leno’s Garage?| website= TotalCarMagazine.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among his collection are two [[Doble steam car]]s, a sedan and a roadster that were owned by [[Howard Hughes]], the fifth [[Duesenberg#Model X .281926.E2.80.931927.29|Duesenberg Model X]] known to survive, and one of nine remaining 1963 [[Chrysler Turbine Car]]s.  The collection also includes three antique [[electric car|electric cars]] — the 1925 [[Baker Motor Vehicle|Baker Electric]] is his wife Mavis's favorite car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leno|first1=Jay|title=The 100-Year-Old Electric Car|journal=Popular Mechanics|date=April 30, 2007|url=https://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/a1609/4215940/|accessdate=2018-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has a regular column in ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'' which showcases his car collection and gives advice about various automotive topics, including restoration and unique models, such as his jet-powered motorcycle and solar-powered hybrid. Leno also writes occasional "Motormouth" articles for ''[[The Sunday Times]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=May 11, 2008| url= http://driving.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/driving/article1746609.ece|title= Jay Leno's million dollar garage |work= The Times|date=May 9, 2007 | location=London | first=Michael | last=Moran}}&lt;/ref&gt; reviewing high-end sports cars and giving his humorous take on automotive matters.

Leno opened his garage to [[Team Bondi]], the company that developed the critically acclaimed video-game ''[[L.A. Noire]]'', which is set in Los Angeles in the late 1940s. Leno's collection contained almost 100 cars from this period, and allowed the team to recreate their images as accurately as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.giantbomb.com/la-noire/3030-21500/|title = L. A. Noire |work = Giantbomb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics===
Hosting the 2014 [[Genesis Prize]] award ceremony in [[Jerusalem]], Leno made jokes mocking then-President [[Barack Obama]] and then-Secretary of State [[John Kerry]], accusing Obama of "trying to break" the U.S.'s relationship with Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.haaretz.com/.premium-leno-takes-aim-at-obama-1.5249329|title=Jay Leno Takes Aim at Obama in Jerusalem Awards Ceremony|last=Sommer|first=Allison Kaplan|work=Haaretz|date=May 22, 2014|accessdate=July 15, 2018|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20180716042208/https://www.haaretz.com/.premium-leno-takes-aim-at-obama-1.5249329|archivedate=July 16, 2018|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2015 interview with ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'', Leno said, "I always considered [[Israel]] as not only the only democracy in the Middle East, I think it’s the purest, because every Israeli voter seems to have his own political party."&lt;ref name=jpost&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/I-like-Jews-but-Italian-food-is-better-406505|title=‘I like Jews, but Italian food is better’|work=Jerusalem Post|date=June 18, 2015|accessdate=July 15, 2018|last=Amouyal|first=Noa}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also added about Israel's relations with other Middle East countries: "Israel is so efficient in defending itself and so good at it, that to the rest of the world it looks like bullying."&lt;ref name=jpost /&gt;
