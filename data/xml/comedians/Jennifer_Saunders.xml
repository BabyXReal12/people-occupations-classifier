'''Jennifer Jane Saunders''' (born 6 July 1958) is an English comedian, [[screenwriter]], and actress. She has won three [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTAs]] (including the [[BAFTA Academy Fellowship Award|BAFTA Fellowship]]), an International [[Emmy Award]] out of 3 nominations, a [[British Comedy Award]], a [[Rose d'Or|Rose d'Or Light Entertainment Festival Award]], two [[Writers' Guild of Great Britain]] Awards, and a [[People's Choice Award]].

Saunders first found attention in the 1980s when she became a member of [[The Comic Strip]] after graduating from the [[Central School of Speech and Drama]] in London. With her [[double act|comedy partner]] [[Dawn French]], she wrote and starred in their eponymous sketch show, ''[[French and Saunders]]'', for which she and French received a BAFTA fellowship in 2009. Saunders received acclaim through the early to mid-1990s for writing and playing the main character of [[Edina Monsoon]] in the BBC sitcom ''[[Absolutely Fabulous]]''.

She has guest-starred in the American sitcoms ''[[Roseanne (TV series)|Roseanne]]'' and ''[[Friends]]'' and won the [[People's Choice Awards]] for voicing the evil [[Fairy Godmother (Shrek)|Fairy Godmother]] in [[DreamWorks Animation|DreamWorks]]' animated ''[[Shrek 2]]''. In 2015, Saunders voiced [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] in the animated comedy film ''[[Minions (film)|Minions]]'', and in 2016 she voiced Nana Noodleman in the animated musical film ''[[Sing (2016 American film)|Sing]]''.

==Early life==
Jennifer Jane Saunders was born on 6 July 1958 in [[Sleaford]], [[Lincolnshire]], England.&lt;ref name="screenonline"&gt;Hannah Hamad.

Retrieved 5 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother, Jane, was a biology teacher, and her father, Robert Thomas Saunders, served as a pilot in the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF), reached the rank of [[Air Marshal]] and later worked for [[British Aerospace]]. She has three brothers.&lt;ref name="looking"&gt;Decca Aitkenhead. ''[http://film.guardian.co.uk/interview/interviewpages/0,,1241436,00.html What are you looking at?]'' &amp;mdash; guardian.co.uk.

As her father was in the armed forces, Saunders moved to different schools many times.&lt;ref name="farewell"/&gt; She was educated from the age of five to 18 in [[boarding school]]s and then at [[St Paul's Girls' School]], an independent school in west London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Forget university. It’s jobs for the top girls|url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/newsreview/education/article1579730.ece|publisher=Sunday Times|date=17 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After school, she worked for a year in Italy as an [[au pair]].&lt;ref&gt;Editors at Teletronic.

She later received a place at the [[Central School of Speech and Drama]] in London on a drama teachers' course in 1977,&lt;ref name="farewell"/&gt; where she met her future comedy partner, [[Dawn French]].&lt;ref&gt;William Langley. [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2006/12/31/do3109.xml "'We know how to use our mighty weight and the power of a full and voluptuous body'"],  telegraph.co.uk; retrieved 6 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both came from RAF backgrounds. They had grown up on the same base, even having had the same best friend, without ever meeting.&lt;ref name="looking"/&gt; The comic duo originally did not get on well, and as far as Saunders was concerned, French was a "cocky little upstart". The distrust was mutual: French considered Saunders snooty and uptight.&lt;ref name="looking"/&gt; French actually wanted to become a drama teacher,&lt;ref name="screenonline"/&gt; whereas Saunders loathed the idea and had not fully understood what the course was about; thus, she disliked French for being enthusiastic and confident about the course.&lt;ref name="farewell"/&gt; Saunders was shocked to find that she was actually taking courses to become a teacher, as her mother had filled out the application form. Her mother, however, was saddened when Saunders chose not to apply for an [[Oxbridge]] university education.&lt;ref name="farewell"/&gt;

After the initial friction while at college, Saunders and French shared a flat together. French has remarked on Saunders's messy habits when sharing the house, stating, "When we lived together in [[Chalk Farm]], she had a room at the top of the house. We got broken into and the police said, 'Well, it is quite bad, but the worst is that room at the top.' And, of course, nobody had been in there."&lt;ref name="farewell"/&gt; The two performed together after graduation, working the festival, cabaret,&lt;ref name="farewell"/&gt; and stand-up circuits. They formed a double-act called The Menopause Sisters. Saunders described the act, which involved wearing [[tampons]] in their ears, as "cringeworthy."&lt;ref name="looking"/&gt; The manager of the club where they performed recalled, "They didn't seem to give a damn. There was no star quality about them at all."&lt;ref name="looking"/&gt;

==Career==
===Early career===
French and Saunders would eventually come to public attention as members of the informal comedy collective [[The Comic Strip]], part of the [[alternative comedy]] scene in the early 1980s. They answered a 1980 advert in ''[[The Stage]]'' newspaper looking for female comedians to perform at The Comic Strip, which had, until that point, only had male performers.&lt;ref name="screenonline"/&gt;&lt;ref name="looking"/&gt; When they walked into the audition, they were immediately told, "You're booked. When can you start?"&lt;ref name="farewell"/&gt;

Both Saunders and French became continuing members of The Comic Strip, which included [[Peter Richardson (actor)|Peter Richardson]], [[Rik Mayall]], and [[Robbie Coltrane]], as well as Saunders' future husband [[Ade Edmondson|Adrian Edmondson]].&lt;ref name="screenonline"/&gt;&lt;ref name="looking"/&gt;

The group performed at the Boulevard Theatre, above Soho's [[Raymond Revuebar]], and gained a cult following, with visiting audience members including [[Dustin Hoffman]], [[Jack Nicholson]], and [[Robin Williams]], who once joined in the performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtimes.co.uk/content.php?contentid=56997|title=Home Cinema @ The Digital Fix - The Comic Strip Presents - The Complete Collection in July|publisher=DVD times.co.uk|date=4 July 2005|accessdate=7 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time French and Saunders became members of The Comic Strip, French was already working as a drama teacher, whilst Saunders was on [[Jobseeker's Allowance|the dole]] and spending a lot of her time sleeping in bed after the dole office closed for the day.&lt;ref name="looking"/&gt;

Saunders starred in a Comic Strip film called ''The Supergrass'', a little-known parody of slick 1980s police dramas directed by Peter Richardson.

Saunders and French followed separate careers as well as maintaining their comedy sketch show. Saunders' biggest solo success has been ''[[Absolutely Fabulous]]''. The comedy was, in fact, based largely on a fourteen-minute ''French &amp; Saunders'' sketch called "Modern Mother and Daughter". Saunders and French were going to star in the comedy together, but just as the studio had been booked, French received a long-awaited phone call confirming that an adoption agency had a new baby for her to adopt.&lt;ref name="farewell"/&gt;

Saunders proceeded to star in the comedy. The series, which she wrote and starred in as the irresponsible fashion [[Public relations|PR]] agent [[Absolutely Fabulous#Eddy|Edina Monsoon]] alongside [[Joanna Lumley]], who played [[Patsy Stone]], brought her international acclaim and attention.&lt;ref name="screenonline"/&gt; The show ran for five full series, two telemovies, three special episodes, and a feature film over the course of twenty-four years from 1992 to 2016.&lt;ref name="screenonline"/&gt; The series is also known as ''Ab Fab''&lt;ref name="looking"/&gt; and was broadcast in the United States on [[Comedy Central]] and [[BBC America]], becoming cult viewing.&lt;ref&gt;James Welsh.[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/ustv/a7694/ab-fab-stars-receive-glbt-pride-award.html "'Ab Fab' stars receive GLBT Pride award"], digitalspy.co.uk; retrieved 5 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
