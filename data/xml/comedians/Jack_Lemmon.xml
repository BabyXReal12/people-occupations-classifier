He starred in over 60 films, such as ''[[Some Like It Hot]]'', ''[[The Apartment]]'', ''[[Mister Roberts (1955 film)|Mister Roberts]]'' (for which he won the 1955 [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]]), ''[[Days of Wine and Roses (film)|Days of Wine and Roses]]'', ''[[The Great Race]]'', ''[[Irma la Douce]]'', ''[[The Odd Couple (film)|The Odd Couple]]'' and its sequel ''[[The Odd Couple II]]'' (and other frequent collaborations with ''Odd Couple'' co-star [[Walter Matthau]]), ''[[Save the Tiger]]'' (for which he won the 1973 [[Academy Award for Best Actor]]), ''[[The Out-of-Towners (1970 film)|The Out-of-Towners]]'', ''[[The China Syndrome]]'', ''[[Missing (1982 film)|Missing]]'', ''[[Glengarry Glen Ross (film)|Glengarry Glen Ross]]'', ''[[Tuesdays with Morrie (film)|Tuesdays with Morrie]]'', ''Out to Sea'', ''[[Grumpy Old Men (film)|Grumpy Old Men]]'', and ''[[Grumpier Old Men]]''.

==Early life==
Lemmon was born on February 8, 1925, in an elevator&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jack Lemmon Interview|url=http://www.abilitymagazine.com/lemmon_interview.html|work=Ability Magazine|date=May 2006|accessdate=August 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Newton-Wellesley Hospital]] in [[Newton, Massachusetts]], a suburb of [[Boston]]. He was the only child of Mildred Burgess LaRue  and John Uhler Lemmon, Jr., the president of a [[doughnut]] company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~battle/celeb/lemmon.htm|title=RootsWeb|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/18/Jack-Lemmon.html |title=Jack Lemmon Biography (1925–2001) |publisher=Filmreference.com |date= |accessdate=December 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was of Irish heritage, and Lemmon was raised Catholic.&lt;ref name=tca&gt;Stated on ''[[Inside the Actors Studio]]'', 1998&lt;/ref&gt; He attended John Ward Elementary School in Newton and the [[Rivers School]] in [[Weston, Massachusetts]]. During his acceptance of his lifetime achievement award, he stated that he knew he wanted to be an actor from the age of eight. Lemmon attended [[Phillips Academy]] (Class of 1943) and [[Harvard College]] (Class of 1947), where he lived in [[Eliot House (Harvard College)|Eliot House]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Pepp| first = Jessica A. | title = Jack Lemmon to Receive Arts Medal | newspaper = [[The Harvard Crimson]]| publisher=[[Harvard University]]|date = February 24, 1995 | url = http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1995/2/24/jack-lemmon-to-receive-arts-medal/ | accessdate = January 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was an active member of several Drama Clubs – and president of the [[Hasty Pudding Club]]&lt;ref name=tca/&gt; – as well as a member of the [[Delphic Club]] for Gentleman, a [[Officially unrecognized Harvard College social clubs|final club]] at Harvard.

At Harvard, Lemmon was a member of the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program]] and was commissioned by the [[United States Navy]],&lt;ref name=tca/&gt; serving briefly as an [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]] on an aircraft carrier during [[World War II]] before returning to Harvard after completing his military service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jack Lemmon Biography Film Actor (1925–2001)|url=http://www.biography.com/people/jack-lemmon-9378762|website=Biography|publisher=Biography.com|accessdate=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After graduation with a degree in War Service Sciences&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jack Lemmon Obituary|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2001/SHOWBIZ/Movies/06/28/lemmon.obit/|work=CNN|date=June 28, 2001|accessdate=August 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1947,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Actor Jack Lemmon Honored by Glee Club, Hasty Pudding|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/1996/12.12/ActorJackLemmon.html|website=Harvard University Gazette|publisher=Harvard University|accessdate=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lemmon took up acting professionally, working on radio, television and Broadway.&lt;ref name=tca/&gt; He studied acting under coach [[Uta Hagen]].&lt;ref name=tca/&gt; He was enamored of the piano and learned to play it on his own. He could also play the harmonica, guitar, organ, and the [[double bass]].

==Career==
[[File:Jack Lemmon 1988 ArM.jpg|thumb|left|Jack Lemmon, attending an awards ceremony in 1988]]
Lemmon's film debut was a [[bit part]] as a plasterer/painter in the 1949 film ''[[The Lady Takes a Sailor]]'', but he went unnoticed until his debut, opposite [[Judy Holliday]], in the 1954 comedy ''[[It Should Happen to You]]''.&lt;ref name=tca/&gt; Lemmon worked with actresses such as [[Marilyn Monroe]], [[Natalie Wood]], [[Betty Grable]], [[Janet Leigh]], [[Shirley MacLaine]], [[Lee Remick]], [[Romy Schneider]], [[Doris Day]], [[Kim Novak]], [[Judy Holliday]], [[Rita Hayworth]], [[June Allyson]], [[Virna Lisi]], [[Ann-Margret]] and [[Sophia Loren]]. He was close friends with actors [[Tony Curtis]], [[Ernie Kovacs]], [[Walter Matthau]] and [[Kevin Spacey]]. He made two films with Curtis, and fifteen with Matthau.

Early in Lemmon's career he met comedian [[Ernie Kovacs]] while co-starring with him in ''[[Operation Mad Ball]]''. Lemmon and Kovacs became close friends and appeared together in two subsequent films, ''[[Bell, Book and Candle]]'' and ''[[It Happened to Jane]]''. In 1977, [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] broadcast a compilation series of Kovacs' television work, and Lemmon served as the narrator of the series. Lemmon discussed his friendship with Kovacs in the documentary ''Ernie Kovacs: Television's Original Genius''.

He was a favorite of director [[Billy Wilder]], starring in the films ''[[Some Like It Hot]]'', ''[[The Apartment]]'', ''[[Irma la Douce]]'', ''[[The Fortune Cookie]]'', ''[[Avanti!]]'', ''[[The Front Page (1974 film)|The Front Page]]'', and ''[[Buddy Buddy]]''. Wilder felt Lemmon had a natural tendency toward overacting that had to be tempered; the Wilder biography ''Nobody's Perfect'' quotes the director as saying, "Lemmon, I would describe him as a ham, a fine ham, and with ham you have to trim a little fat." The biography quotes Lemmon as saying, "I am particularly susceptible to the parts I play... If my character was having a nervous breakdown, I started to have one."

He enjoyed longtime working relationships with both [[Blake Edwards]], starring in ''[[Days of Wine and Roses (film)|Days of Wine and Roses]]'' (1962), ''[[The Great Race]]'' (1965) and ''[[That's Life! (film)|That's Life!]]'' (1986), and [[Richard Quine]], starring in ''[[My Sister Eileen (1955 film)|My Sister Eileen]]'', ''[[Operation Mad Ball]]'', ''[[Bell, Book and Candle]]'', ''[[It Happened to Jane]]'', and ''[[How to Murder Your Wife]]''. Quine also directed Lemmon's screen test when the actor was signed by Columbia.

==Singing and piano playing==
Lemmon's singing voice was first heard on two film soundtracks in 1955, ''[[Three for the Show]]'' with [[Betty Grable]] and ''[[My Sister Eileen (1955 film)|My Sister Eileen]]''. He also performed songs in the 1956 film ''[[You Can't Run Away from It]]'' with [[Stubby Kaye]] and [[June Allyson]]. His first solo album, ''A Twist of Lemmon'', was released in 1958 on [[Epic Records]]. While filming ''[[Some Like It Hot]]'' with [[Marilyn Monroe]] in 1959, Lemmon released a second album, ''Some Like It Hot''. Both featured Lemmon's singing and piano solos.

The two Epic albums were later released as ''A Twist of Lemmon/Some Like It Hot'', a single CD on Collector's Choice Music, in 2001. Two singles, "Daphne"/"Sleepy Lagoon" (released in 1959) and "[[I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles]]"/"[[I Cover the Waterfront (song)|I Cover the Waterfront]]" (released in 1960) did not appear on either album. Epic released a third single in 1960, Lemmon's piano solo of the theme to the film ''[[The Apartment]]'', backed with his own composition "Lemmon Blues". In 1963, Lemmon released a third album, this time on [[Capitol Records]], entitled ''Jack Lemmon Plays Piano Selections from Irma La Douce.''

==Awards and career highlights==
Lemmon was awarded the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor Oscar]] in 1956 for ''[[Mister Roberts (1955 film)|Mister Roberts]]'' (1955) and the [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor Oscar]] for ''[[Save the Tiger]]'' (1973), becoming the first actor to achieve this rare double (the only other actors to achieve this are: [[Robert De Niro]], [[Gene Hackman]], [[Jack Nicholson]], [[Kevin Spacey]], and [[Denzel Washington]]).&lt;ref name=tca/&gt; He was also nominated for a Best Actor Oscar for his role in the controversial film ''[[Missing (1982 film)|Missing]]'' in 1982, and for his roles in ''[[Some Like It Hot]]'' (1959), ''[[The Apartment]]'' (1960), ''[[Days of Wine and Roses (film)|Days of Wine and Roses]]'' (1962), ''[[The China Syndrome]]'' (1979), for which he was also awarded [[Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]], and ''[[Tribute (1980 film)|Tribute]]'' (1980). He won another Cannes award for his performance in ''Missing'' (which received the [[Palme d'Or]] as well). In 1986, the U.S. [[National Board of Review of Motion Pictures]] gave Lemmon a "Career Achievement" award;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nationalboardofreview.org/award-years/1986/ |title=1986 Award Winners |author= |date=2016 |publisher=[[National Board of Review of Motion Pictures]] |work= |accessdate=October 31, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; two years later, the [[American Film Institute]] gave him its [[AFI Life Achievement Award|Lifetime Achievement Award]].

''[[Days of Wine and Roses (film)|Days of Wine and Roses]]'' (1962) was a favorite role of Lemmon's. He portrayed Joe Clay, a young, fun-loving alcoholic businessman. In that film, Lemmon delivered the line, "My name is Joe Clay ... I'm an alcoholic." Three and a half decades later, he stated on the television program ''[[Inside the Actors Studio]]'' that he was a recovering alcoholic.&lt;ref name=tca/&gt;

Lemmon's production company JML produced ''[[Cool Hand Luke]]'' in 1967. [[Paul Newman]] was grateful to Lemmon for his support and offered him the role of the Sundance Kid, later played by [[Robert Redford]] in ''[[Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid]]'', but Lemmon turned it down. He did not like riding horses and he felt he'd already played too many aspects of the Sundance Kid's character before.&lt;ref&gt;''A slice of Lemmon for extra character'', Bob Flynn, Panorama, p. 7, Canberra Times, August 15, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

Lemmon appeared in many films partnered with actor [[Walter Matthau]]. Among their pairings was 1968's ''[[The Odd Couple (film)|The Odd Couple]]'', as [[The Odd Couple (film)|Felix Ungar]] (Lemmon) and [[The Odd Couple (film)|Oscar Madison]] (Matthau). The first film they starred in together was ''[[The Fortune Cookie]]'' (for which Matthau won the 1966 Oscar for Best Supporting Actor), ''[[The Front Page (1974 film)|The Front Page]]'' and ''[[Buddy Buddy]]''. In 1971, Lemmon directed Matthau in the comedy ''[[Kotch]]''. It was the only movie that Lemmon directed and Matthau was nominated for the Best Actor Oscar for his performance.

Additionally, Lemmon and Matthau had small parts in [[Oliver Stone]]'s 1991 film, ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]'' (the only film in which both appeared without sharing screen time). In 1993, the duo teamed again to star in ''[[Grumpy Old Men (film)|Grumpy Old Men]]''. The film was a surprise hit, earning the two actors a new generation of young fans.  During the rest of the decade, they would star together in ''[[Grumpier Old Men]]'', ''[[Out to Sea]]'', and the widely panned ''[[The Odd Couple II]]''. In 1996, Lemmon was awarded the [[Golden Bear|Honorary Golden Bear]] award at the [[46th Berlin International Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="Berlinale1996"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1996/03_preistr_ger_1996/03_Preistraeger_1996.html |title=Berlinale: 1996 Prize Winners |accessdate=January 1, 2012 |work=berlinale.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, Lemmon was a guest voice on ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[The Twisted World of Marge Simpson]]," playing the character Frank Ormand, owner of the pretzel business that [[Marge Simpson]] franchised. The recurring ''Simpsons'' character [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Gil Gunderson|Gil Gunderson]], voiced by [[Dan Castellaneta]], is an ongoing parody of Lemmon's character in ''[[Glengarry Glen Ross]]''.

At the [[55th Golden Globe Awards|1998 Golden Globe Awards]], he was nominated for "Best Actor in a Made for TV Movie" for his role in ''[[12 Angry Men (1997 film)|Twelve Angry Men]]'', losing to [[Ving Rhames]]. After accepting the award, Rhames asked Lemmon to come on stage and, in a move that stunned the audience, gave his award to him. (The [[Hollywood Foreign Press Association]], which presents the Golden Globes, had a second award made and sent to Rhames.)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk3EgDPZD0w# Ving Rhames gives his Golden Globe to Jack Lemmon (1998)]&lt;/ref&gt; He received the [[AFI Life Achievement Award]] in 1988.

Lemmon won the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie]] for his role as Morrie Schwartz in his final television role, ''[[Tuesdays with Morrie (film)|Tuesdays with Morrie]]''. His final film role was an uncredited one: the narrator in [[Robert Redford]]'s film ''[[The Legend of Bagger Vance]]''.

Actor [[Kevin Spacey]] recalled that Lemmon is remembered for always making time for other people. Already regarded as a legend, he met teenage Spacey backstage after a theater performance and spoke to him about pursuing an acting career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Drnz1mbpui4 |title=Charlie Rose – Kevin Spacey / Jamaica Kincaid |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=December 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spacey would later work with Lemmon in ''[[The Murder of Mary Phagan]]'' (1987), ''[[Dad (film)|Dad]]'' (1989), the critically acclaimed film ''[[Glengarry Glen Ross (film)|Glengarry Glen Ross]]'' (1992), and on stage in a revival of ''[[Long Day's Journey into Night]]''. Lemmon was Spacey's [[mentor]], and reportedly taught Spacey that people who do well in a business have an obligation to "send the elevator back down" to help lift people starting out on the ground floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEQkTeZQnw4&amp;t=32s |title=Jameson First Shot |publisher=YouTube |date=September 13, 2011 |accessdate=June 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his autobiography, ''My Life'', [[Burt Reynolds]] recalls Lemmon as the quintessential gentleman who never spoke ill of anyone, even if they deserved it. This kindness backfired for Reynolds: prior to accepting the lead in ''[[W.W. and the Dixie Dancekings]]'' (1975), directed by [[John G. Avildsen]], Reynolds asked Lemmon, whom Avildsen had directed in ''[[Save the Tiger]]'' (1973) for an opinion of Avildsen as a director. Lemmon told Reynolds that Avildsen was "okay", and Reynolds accepted the role. After the film was released and his experiences during the production proved unhappy, Reynolds complained to Lemmon and described Avildsen as an "asshole", whereupon Lemmon replied, "I guess you could say that."&lt;ref&gt;[[Reynolds, Burt]]. (1994) ''My Life''. New York: Hyperion. {{ISBN|0-7868-6130-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Lemmon was married twice. His first wife was actress [[Cynthia Stone]], with whom he had a son, [[Chris Lemmon]] (born 1954). His second wife was actress [[Felicia Farr]], with whom he had a daughter, Courtney (born 1966). Farr had a daughter from a previous relationship (her marriage to [[Lee Farr]]) named Denise. Lemmon was a [[Catholicism|Catholic]].&lt;ref&gt;Don Widener ''Lemmon: A Biography'' (1975), page 7&lt;/ref&gt; He publicly announced his alcoholism during a 1998 interview on ''[[Inside the Actors Studio]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/may/29/entertainment/la-et-st-james-lipton-20130529|title=James Lipton's 'Inside the Actors Studio' hits 250 on changing Bravo|author=Meredith Blake|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=May 29, 2013|accessdate=July 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Jack Lemmon grave at Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Brentwood, California.JPG|200px|thumb|right|Jack Lemmon's grave in [[Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery]]]]
To golfers everywhere Lemmon was known as the "star" of the celebrity-packed third round telecast of the annual [[AT&amp;T Pebble Beach Pro-Am]], held at [[Pebble Beach Golf Links]] each February. Lemmon's packed gallery was there not only for his humor but also to root him on in his lifelong quest to "make the cut" to round 4, something he was never able to achieve. The amateur who helps his team most in the Pro-Am portion is annually awarded the Jack Lemmon Award.

During the 1980s and 1990s Lemmon served on the advisory board of the [[National Student Film Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Editor|title=National Student Film Institute/L.A:  The Sixteenth Annual Los Angeles Student Film Festival|date=June 10, 1994|location=The Directors Guild Theatre|pages=10–11|accessdate=6 January 2018|ref=Program}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Editor|title=Los Angeles Student Film Institute: 13th Annual Student Film Festival|date=June 7, 1991|location=The Directors Guild Theatre|page=3|accessdate=6 January 2018|ref=Program}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lemmon was a registered [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/jun/29/guardianobituaries.filmnews2|title=Obituary: Jack Lemmon|last=Baxter|first=Brian|date=2001-06-29|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Lemmon died of [[metastasis|metastatic cancer]] of the [[urinary bladder|bladder]] on June 27, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Aljean Harmetz]] |coauthors= |title=Jack Lemmon, Dark and Comic Actor, Dies at 76 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/06/29/movies/jack-lemmon-dark-and-comic-actor-dies-at-76.html |quote=Jack Lemmon, the brash young American Everyman who evolved into the screen's grumpiest old Everyman during a movie career that lasted a half century, died on Wednesday at a hospital in Los Angeles. He was 76 years of age and was resident in [[Beverly Hills]]. The cause was complications from cancer, said a spokesman, Warren Cowan.   |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=June 29, 2001 |accessdate=August 22, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He had been fighting the disease privately for two years before his death. His body was interred at [[Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery]] in [[Westwood, Los Angeles|Westwood]], California. (The graves of [[Walter Matthau]], a close friend of Lemmon's who acted with him in multiple cinematic productions, and collaborative film director [[Billy Wilder]] lie in the same cemetery.) Lemmon's gravestone reads like a title screen from a film: "JACK LEMMON in".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seeing-stars.com/imagepages/jacklemmongravephoto.shtml "THE GRAVE OF JACK LEMMON"].
