'''John Edward Szeles''' (born September 9, 1958), better known by the [[stage name]] '''The Amazing Johnathan''', is an [[United States|American]] [[stand-up comedy|stand-up comedian]]/[[Magician (illusion)|magician]]. His act is mostly composed of hijinks, interaction with one specific audience member, and a few legitimate magic tricks. From 2001 to 2014, he was a year-round headliner in Las Vegas. Self-described as the "[[Freddy Krueger]] of Comedy",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Blowen |first=Michael |title=Pauly Shore, Part 2: The grown-up years? |work=The Boston Globe |date=1998-04-17 |accessdate=2008-11-09 |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=BG&amp;p_theme=bg&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EADDD15441FBFD9&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM |quote=The Amazing Jonathan, the self-proclaimed Freddie Krueger of Comedy, is at the Comedy Palace at Grill 93 off Route 93 in Andover tonight and tomorrow night.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Szeles performs wearing his everpresent headband and his shows frequently use gore, such as pretending to suck on his own hanging eyeball, cutting his wrists, and skewering his own tongue. He is also good friends with fellow performer [[Criss Angel]], and has helped Angel perform a variety of illusions, most notably during his three guest appearances on ''[[Mindfreak]]''.

==Career==

===Early career===
Szeles, who began his career performing in the streets of [[San Francisco]],&lt;ref name=LAT&gt;{{cite news |title=Best bets 1/18 |work=Los Angeles Times |location=Orange County edition |date=2001-01-18 |accessdate=2008-11-09 |page=F.2 |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/66927908.html?dids=66927908:66927908&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Jan+18%2C+2001&amp;author=&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;desc=BEST+BETS+1%2F18&amp;pqatl=google |quote=A San Francisco street performer in the '70s, the Amazing Jonathan...}}&lt;/ref&gt; first appeared on television in ''The 8th Annual Young Comedians Show'' in 1983 and later went on to become the host of the short-lived 1991 syndicated variety/[[game show]] ''[[Ruckus (game show)|Ruckus]]''. He appeared on various talk and variety shows from the mid-80s to mid 2000s. His only credited performance as an actor was The Obligatory Holiday Episode of ''[[The Weird Al Show]]'' (playing the part of Uncle Johnathan). He has made several appearances on Late Night with David Letterman, a record 24 appearances on Fox's Comic Strip Live, and has had several specials on [[Comedy Central]] including ''[[Comedy Central Presents]]'', ''[[The Lounge Lizards]]'' and more recently his own one-hour special entitled ''Wrong on Every Level''., He dedicated the special to his Uncle Eugene, who showed him his first card trick which "started this whole mess". His only film appearance is the 2005 [[documentary film|documentary]] ''[[The Aristocrats (film)|The Aristocrats]]''.

Johnathan had huge success in Australia, becoming a household name due to his many well-received performances on Channel 9's "Hey Hey Its Saturday".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minisites.ninemsn.com.au/9stories/8911130/the-amazing-johnathan-reveals-he-is-dying|title='The Amazing Johnathan' reveals he is dying|work=minisites|accessdate=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Szeles has also authored a how-to book on practical jokes titled ''Every Trick in the Book'', a compilation of both classic practical jokes and plain magic tricks, along with his own original material in both categories. He is currently finishing up his memoirs, entitled, "Drive It Like You Stole It."

===Recent years===
In 2008, Szeles combined two of his passions (classic car collecting and drive-in movie theaters) to open the "Amazing Underground" a members only indoor drive-in movie theatre located within his warehouse facilities in Las Vegas.

As of 2011, Szeles was performing regular shows in [[Las Vegas Strip|Las Vegas]] at the Harmon Theater while also taking select dates at venues across the United States and in Australia. 2011 marks Szeles' third year of performing at the Harmon Theatre and Szeles' 11th consecutive year as a full-time Las Vegas headliner. He has won "Best Comedian" award from Las Vegas Review Journal, Comedian of the Year from Nevada Magazine, Top Ten Acts in Vegas (LVRJ) and is the longest running, most successful solo comic magician in U.S history.

In 2013, Szeles hosted an online talk show called "Burn Unit".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.burnunit.tv/|title=Amazing Johnathan's Burn Unit|work=burnunit.tv|accessdate=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In March 2007 it was reported that Szeles was diagnosed with "a serious heart condition".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Weatherford |first=Mike |title=Amazing Johnathan to bid farewell |publisher=''Las Vegas Review-Journal'' |date=March 8, 2007 |url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2007/Mar-08-Thu-2007/living/12836045.html |accessdate=2007-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The performer's website identified the condition as [[cardiomyopathy]] and went on to assert that, due to a combination of weight loss and blood thinners, he was doing well.

In December 2012, Szeles ended his one-year contract with [[Bally's Las Vegas|Bally's]] and ceased performing in Las Vegas. He had been performing in the town for 13 years.

Szeles toured throughout 2013, playing [[The Improv]] comedy clubs. However, his heart condition worsened, and Szeles announced that he would effectively retire, performing a final show in Toledo for the general public, and then for members of The Magic Castle on June 30 and July 1 of 2014.

Szeles' final shows were sold out and he received standing ovations each night. On November 5, 2014, in front of a live audience on ENT Speaks, he stated that he had a year to live.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PW42har08D4|title=ENT Speaks Amazing Johnathan|date=5 November 2014|work=YouTube|accessdate=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the Amazing Johnathan played several shows across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amazingj.com/live.htm|title=Amazing Jonathan Live Dates}}&lt;/ref&gt;
