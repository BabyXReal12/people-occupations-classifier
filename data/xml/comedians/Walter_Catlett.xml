'''Walter Catlett''' (February 4, 1889&amp;nbsp;– November 14, 1960) was an American actor. He made a career of playing excitable, meddlesome, temperamental, and officious blowhards.

==Career==
Catlett was born in [[San Francisco]], California. He started out in [[vaudeville]], teaming up with [[Hobart Cavanaugh]] at some point,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hobart Cavanaugh, Noted Film, Stage Actor, Dead at 63 |newspaper=Miami Daily News-Record |agency=Associated Press |date=April 26, 1950 |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/1308643/hobart_cavanaugh_obituary/ |via = [[Newspapers.com]]}} {{Open access}})&lt;/ref&gt; with a detour for a while in opera, before breaking into acting. 

He started on stage in 1906 and made his Broadway debut in either ''The Prince of Pilsen'' (1911)&lt;ref name=VE&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cullen|first1=Frank |last2=Hackman|first2=Florence |last3=McNeilly|first3=Donald |title=Vaudeville, Old and New: An Encyclopedia of Variety Performers in America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XFnfnKg6BcAC&amp;pg=PA207&amp;lpg=PA207&amp;dq=Walter+Catlett+vaudeville&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5vnHqJr6y4&amp;sig=OWuGcdTo_uPgA9dlr4jjFd1jXS8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=SAprVI3rEpProASF9ICoBQ&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Walter%20Catlett%20vaudeville&amp;f=false|accessdate=November 18, 2014|date=October 16, 2006|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9780415938532|pages=207–208}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''So Long Letty'' (1916).&lt;ref&gt;{{ibdb name|34895}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

His first film appearance was in 1912, but then he went back to stage and did not return to films until 1929. He performed in operettas and musicals, including ''The Ziegfeld Follies of 1917'', the original production of the [[Jerome Kern]] musical ''[[Sally (musical)|Sally]]'' (1920) and the Gershwins' ''[[Lady Be Good (musical)|Lady Be Good]]'' (1924). In the last, he introduced the song "[[Oh, Lady Be Good!]]"&lt;ref name=VE/&gt;

Catlett made a handful of [[silent film]] appearances, but his film career did not catch on until the advent of talking pictures allowed moviegoers to experience his full comic repertoire. Three of his most remembered roles were as the theatre manager driven to distraction by [[James Cagney]]'s character in ''[[Yankee Doodle Dandy]]'', the local constable who throws the entire cast in jail and winds up there himself in the [[Howard Hawks]]' classic screwball comedy ''[[Bringing Up Baby]]'', and as Morrow, the drunken poet in the restaurant who "knows when [he's] been a skunk" and takes Longfellow Deeds on a "bender" in ''[[Mr. Deeds Goes to Town]]''. ''[[The New York Times]]'' film critic [[Mordaunt Hall]] wrote that "This clever comedian runs away with the acting laurels" in ''[[Big City Blues (1932 film)|Big City Blues]]'' (1932).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C06EFD61231E633A25753C1A96F9C946394D6CF|title=Big City Blues (1932)/Walter Catlett Affords Good Fun in "Big City Blues", the New Film at the Winter Garden.|last=Hall|first=Mordaunt|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=November 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He played [[John Barsad]] in the 1935 [[David O. Selznick]] production of ''[[A Tale of Two Cities (1935 film)|A Tale of Two Cities]]'', starring [[Ronald Colman]]. He also provided the uncredited voice of [[The Fox and the Cat#In Disney media|J. Worthington Foulfellow (a.k.a. Honest John) the Fox]] in the 1940 [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] animated film ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]''. In the 1950s, he appeared in films like ''[[Here Comes the Groom]]'', ''[[Friendly Persuasion (1956 film)|Friendly Persuasion]]'', and ''[[Beau James]]'', as well as Disney's TV series ''[[Davy Crockett (TV miniseries)|Davy Crockett]]''.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

For his contributions to the [[film industry]], Catlett was inducted into the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] on February 8, 1960 with a [[List of actors with Hollywood Walk of Fame motion picture stars|motion pictures star]] located at 1713 [[Vine Street]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walkoffame.com/walter-catlett |title=Hollywood Walk of Fame - Walter Catlett |website=walkoffame.com |publisher=Hollywood Chamber of Commerce |accessdate=February 11, 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170515105711/http://www.walkoffame.com/walter-catlett |archivedate=May 15, 2017 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/walter-catlett|title=Walter Catlett|publisher=''[[Los Angeles Times]]''|accessdate=November 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
