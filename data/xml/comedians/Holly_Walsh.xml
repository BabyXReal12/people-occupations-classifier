'''Holly Walsh''' (born 8 November 1980) is an English comedian and [[comedy writer]], known mainly for her work on TV and radio in the UK.

==Early life==

Walsh attended [[Christ's Hospital]] School, before going on to read History of Art at [[Gonville and Caius College]] at the [[University of Cambridge]], which she described as 'the most boring three years of my life".&lt;ref name="Guardian17Mar09"/&gt; After graduating she worked in various small art galleries in [[East (London sub region)|East London]].&lt;ref name="Guardian17Mar09"/&gt;

==Comedy==

While working in galleries, Walsh attended comedy writing evening classes including ''Stand up and Deliver'' and as a direct result wrote for [[Jo Caulfield]] on [[BBC Radio 4]].&lt;ref name="Guardian17Mar09"/&gt; In 2006 she switched to comedy full-time.&lt;ref name="Guardian17Mar09"/&gt; In 2007 Walsh was approached by [[Frank Skinner]] to appear in a TV pilot, ''Frank Skinner's Skateboarding Dog'' for Avalon Entertainment.&lt;ref name="Guardian17Mar09" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JBJProfile"/&gt;
