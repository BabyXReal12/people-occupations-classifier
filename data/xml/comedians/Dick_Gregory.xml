'''Richard Claxton Gregory''' (October 12, 1932&amp;nbsp;– August 19, 2017) was an [[African-American]] comedian, [[civil rights movement|civil rights]] activist, social critic, writer, conspiracy theorist,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wiley|first=Ed|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/14789644/|title=The 9/11 conspiracy: Rubbish or reality? – US news – Life – Race &amp; ethnicity|publisher=MSNBC|date=November 9, 2006|access-date=2012-04-04|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140319012825/http://www.nbcnews.com/id/14789644/|archivedate=March 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4749316 "Dick Gregory's Role as Michael Jackson's Adviser"], NPR, July 12, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; entrepreneur,&lt;ref name="Wiley"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wiley|first=Ed|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/14789644/|title=The 9/11 conspiracy: Rubbish or reality? – US news – Life – Race &amp; ethnicity|publisher=MSNBC|date=November 9, 2006|access-date=2012-04-04|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140319012825/http://www.nbcnews.com/id/14789644/|archivedate=March 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="npr.org"&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4749316 "Dick Gregory's Role as Michael Jackson's Adviser"], NPR, July 12, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; and occasional actor. During the turbulent 1960s, Gregory became a pioneer in stand-up comedy for his "no-holds-barred" sets, in which he mocked bigotry and [[Racism in the United States|racism]]. He performed primarily to black audiences at [[Racial segregation|segregated]] clubs until 1961, when he became the first black comedian to successfully cross over to white audiences, appearing on television and putting out comedy record albums.&lt;ref name="newsweek"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Porter|first1=Tom|title=Here's all you need to know about pioneering comedian and civil rights activist Dick Gregory, who has died aged 84|url=http://www.newsweek.com/dick-gregory-heres-what-you-need-know-about-pioneering-comedian-and-civil-652431|accessdate=August 20, 2017|work=Newsweek|date=August 20, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gregory was at the forefront of political activism in the 1960s, when he protested the Vietnam War and [[Racism in the United States#African Americans|racial injustice]]. He was arrested multiple times and went on many hunger strikes.&lt;ref&gt;''Democracy Now'', Amy Goodman, Aug 21 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; He later became a speaker and author, primarily promoting spirituality.&lt;ref name="newsweek"/&gt;

Gregory died of heart failure at a Washington, D.C., hospital at age 84 in August 2017.&lt;ref name="newsweek"/&gt;

== Early life ==
Gregory was born in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], the son of Lucille, a housemaid, and Presley Gregory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/people/history/historians-miscellaneous-biographies/dick-gregory "Dick Gregory"], Contemporary Black Biography. ''Encyclopedia.com''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vecono" /&gt; When he was nine years old, he was the victim of a racist attack for touching a white woman's leg while shining her shoes.&lt;ref name="vecono" &gt;{{cite news|author=|title=Obituary: Richard "Dick" Gregory died on August 19th|url=https://www.economist.com/news/obituary/21728607-american-comedian-dietician-and-civil-rights-campaigner-was-84-obituary-richard-dick|work=[[The Economist]]|date=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Sumner High School (St. Louis)|Sumner High School]], he was aided by teachers, among them Warren St. James; he also excelled at running. Gregory earned a track scholarship to [[Southern Illinois University Carbondale|Southern Illinois University]] (SIU),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aeiSpeakers.com/speakerbio.php?SpeakerID=461 Dick Gregory], AEI Speakers Bureau. Accessed December 11, 2007. "A track star at Sumner High School, Gregory earned an athletic scholarship in 1951 to Southern Illinois University at Carbondale and became the first member of his family to attend college."&lt;/ref&gt; where he set school records as a half-miler and miler.&lt;ref name="root-19aug2017"&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Fields-White|first1=Monée|title=Comedian and Civil Rights Activist Dick Gregory Dead at 84|url=http://www.theroot.com/comedian-and-civil-rights-activist-dick-gregory-dead-at-1797977671|magazine=[[The Root (magazine)|The Root]]|accessdate=August 20, 2017|date=August 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of [[Alpha Phi Alpha]] fraternity. In 1954, his college career was interrupted for two years when he was drafted into the [[United States Army]]. At the urging of his commanding officer, who had taken notice of his penchant for joking, Gregory got his start in comedy in the Army, where he entered and won several talent shows. In 1956, Gregory briefly returned to SIU after his discharge, but dropped out because he felt that the university "didn't want me to study, they wanted me to run."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Otfinoski|first1=Steven|title=African Americans in the Performing Arts|date=2014|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=1438107765|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the hopes of becoming a professional comedian, Gregory moved to [[Chicago, Illinois]], where he became part of a new generation of black comedians that included [[Nipsey Russell]], [[Bill Cosby]], and [[Godfrey Cambridge]], all of whom broke with the minstrel tradition that presented stereotypical black characters. Gregory drew on current events, especially racial issues, for much of his material: "Segregation is not all bad. Have you ever heard of a collision where the people in the back of the bus got hurt?"&lt;ref name=Biography/&gt;

Gregory began his career as a comedian while serving in the military in the mid-1950s. He served in the Army for a year and a half at [[Fort Hood]] in Texas,  [[Fort Lee (Virginia)|Fort Lee]] in Virginia, and Fort Smith in Arkansas. He was drafted in 1954 while attending Southern Illinois University. After being discharged in 1956, he returned to the university but did not receive a degree. He moved to Chicago with a desire to perform comedy professionally.&lt;ref name=Biography&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dickgregory.com/about_dick_gregory.html|title=About – Dick Gregory Global Watch|author=Flash|work=dickgregory.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070617034501/http://www.dickgregory.com/about_dick_gregory.html|archivedate=June 17, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, Gregory opened the Apex Club nightclub in Illinois. The club failed and landed Gregory in financial hardship. In 1959, Gregory landed a job as master of ceremonies at the Roberts Show Club.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visionaryproject.org/gregorydick/ "Dick Gregory – National Visionary"], National Visionary Leadership Project.&lt;/ref&gt;

While working for the [[United States Postal Service]] during the daytime, Gregory performed as a comedian in small, primarily black-patronized [[nightclub]]s. He was one of the first black comedians to gain widespread acclaim while performing for white audiences. In an interview with ''[[HuffPost|The Huffington Post]]'', Gregory described the history of black comics as limited: "Blacks could sing and dance in the white night clubs but weren't allowed to stand flat-footed and talk to white folks, which is what a comic does."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Saunders|first1=Lonna|title=Dick Gregory: "What I'm Running From" Bryn Mawr College Feb. 28|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lonna-saunders/dick-gregory_b_2756800.html|accessdate=24 August 2017|publisher=Huffington Post|date=29 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961, Gregory was working at the black-owned Roberts Show Bar in Chicago when he was spotted by [[Hugh Hefner]]. Gregory was performing the following material before a largely white audience:

{{quote|Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I understand there are a good many Southerners in the room tonight. I know the South very well. I spent twenty years there one night.

Last time I was down South I walked into this restaurant and this white waitress came up to me and said, "We don't serve colored people here." I said, "That's all right. I don't eat colored people. Bring me a whole fried chicken."

Then these three white boys came up to me and said, "Boy, we're giving you fair warning. Anything you do to that chicken, we're gonna do to you." So I put down my knife and fork, I picked up that chicken and I kissed it. Then I said, "Line up, boys!"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.duckProds.com/projects/dickgGregory Joke Gregory Told That Got Him Hired By High Hefner.]{{dead link|date=December 2016|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Gregory attributed the launch of his career to Hefner. Based on his performance at Roberts Show Bar, Hefner hired Gregory to work at the Chicago [[Playboy|Playboy Club]] as a replacement for comedian "Professor" [[Irwin Corey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/21/nyregion/21comicswe.html|title=A Bit Slower, but Still Throwing Lethal Punch Lines|first=Phillip|last=Lutz|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=February 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gregory made his first television appearance on the late night show ''[[Tonight Starring Jack Paar]]''.&lt;ref name=Paar&gt;{{cite web|title=Dick Gregory's Appearance on Arsenio PT. 2|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXUBS-sieOg|website=YouTube|access-date=11 November 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161111200730/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXUBS-sieOg|archivedate=11 November 2016|date=16 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He soon began appearing nationally and on television.

Early in his career, Gregory was offered an engagement on ''Tonight Starring Jack Paar''.&lt;ref name=Paar/&gt; [[Jack Paar|Paar's]] show was known for helping propel entertainers to the next level of their careers. At the time, black comics did perform on the show, but after their performances, they were never asked to stay and sit on the famous couch and talk with the host.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/19/arts/dick-gregory-dies-at-84.html|title=Dick Gregory, 84, Dies; Found Humor in the Civil Rights Struggle|last=Haberman|first=Clyde|date=19 August 2017|publisher=''New York Times''|accessdate=25 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dick Gregory declined several invitations from Jack Paar to perform on the show. Paar finally called him to find out why he refused to perform on his show. In order to have Gregory perform, the producers eventually agreed to allow him to stay after his performance and talk with the host on air.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; This was a first in the show's history. Gregory's interview on ''Tonight Starring Jack Paar'' spurred conversations across America.&lt;ref name=Paar/&gt;

Gregory's comedy occasioned controversy in some conservative white circles. The administration of the University of Tennessee, for instance, branded Gregory an "extreme racist"&lt;ref name="KNS-2017"&gt;Ernest Freeberg, [http://www.knoxnews.com/story/opinion/columnists/2017/09/07/inviting-controversy-when-tennessee-students-demanded-free-speech-rights-half-century-ago/625129001/ "Inviting Controversy: When Tennessee Students Demanded Free Speech Rights, a Half Century Ago"], ''Knoxville News Sentinel'', Sept. 7, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; whose "appearance would be an outrage and an insult to many citizens of this state",&lt;ref&gt;G. Michel, ''Struggle for a Better South: The Southern Student Organization Committee, 1964-1969'' (Springer 2004), p.183.&lt;/ref&gt; and revoked his invitation by students to speak on campus. The students sued, with noted litigator [[William Kunstler]] as their counsel, and in ''Smith v. University of Tennessee'', 300 F. Supp. 777 (E.D. Tenn. 1969), won an order from the court that the University's policy was "too broad and vague". The University of Tennessee then implemented an "open speaker" system, and Gregory subsequently performed in April, 1970.&lt;ref name="KNS-2017" /&gt;

== Post-standup career ==
Gregory was number 82 on [[Comedy Central]]'s list of the ''100 Greatest Stand-ups'' of all time and had his own star on the [[St. Louis Walk of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stlouiswalkoffame.org/inductees/?view=achievement|title=St. Louis Walk of Fame Inductees|last=St. Louis Walk of Fame|publisher=|access-date=April 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a co-host with radio personality [[Cathy Hughes]], and was a frequent morning guest, on WOL 1450 AM talk radio's "The Power", the flagship station of Hughes' Radio One.&lt;ref name="globe-24aug2000"&gt;{{cite news|first=Wil|last=Haywood|url=http://www.commondreams.org/views/2000/08/24/pain-and-passion-dick-gregory|title=The Pain and Passion of Dick Gregory|newspaper=[[Boston Globe]]|date=August 24, 2000|publisher=[[CommonDreams]]|accessdate=August 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also appeared regularly on the nationally syndicated ''[[Imus in the Morning]]'' program.&lt;ref name="huffpo-20aug2017"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hinckley|first1=David|title=How Dick Gregory Took Himself Off the Main Stage, and Why|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-dick-gregory-took-himself-off-the-main-stage-and_us_599922e7e4b03b5e472cf06c|website=[[Huffington Post]]|accessdate=August 20, 2017|date=August 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gregory appeared as "Mr. Sun" on the television show ''[[Wonder Showzen]]'' (the third episode, entitled "Ocean", aired in 2005). As Chauncey, a puppet character, imbibes a [[hallucinogen]]ic substance, Mr. Sun warns, "Don't get hooked on imagination, Chauncey. It can lead to terrible, horrible things." Gregory also provided guest commentary on the ''Wonder Showzen'' Season One DVD.&lt;ref name="ign-15mar2006"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Drucker|first1=Michael|title=Wonder Showzen: Season One|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2006/03/16/wonder-showzen-season-one?page=2|website=[[IGN]]|accessdate=August 20, 2017|date=March 15, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large segments of his commentary were intentionally bleeped out, including the names of several dairy companies, as he made potentially defamatory remarks concerning ill effects that the consumption of [[Milk|cow milk]] has on human beings.

Gregory attended and spoke at the funeral of [[James Brown]] on December 30, 2006, in [[Augusta, Georgia]].&lt;ref name="pbs-20aug2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nguyen|first1=Daisy|title=Comedian, civil rights activist Dick Gregory dies|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/comedian-civil-rights-activist-dick-gregory-dies/|accessdate=August 20, 2017|agency=Associated Press|newspaper=[[PBS]]|date=August 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gregory was an occasional guest on the Mark Thompson's ''Make It Plain'' Sirius Channel 146 Radio Show from 3pm to 6pm PST.&lt;ref name="laugh-2007"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Haggins|first1=Bambi|title=Laughing Mad: The Black Comic Persona in Post-soul America|date=2007|publisher=[[Rutgers University Press]]|isbn=9780813539850|page=22|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=REBY5ldTaAAC&amp;lpg=PA22&amp;ots=c3SXt5CDVO&amp;dq=dick-gregory%20%22make%20it%20plain%22&amp;pg=PA22#v=onepage&amp;q=dick-gregory%20%22make%20it%20plain%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gregory appeared on [[Alex Jones (radio host)|''The Alex Jones Show'']] on September 14, 2010, March 19, 2012, and April 1, 2014.&lt;ref name="jones-14sep2010"&gt;{{cite web|title=Civil Rights Icon Dick Gregory: The Social Engineers are Here to Divide and Conquer Us 1/4|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujo6CQKQNrI|website=The Alex Jones Channel|via=YouTube|date=September 14, 2010|accessdate=August 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jones-19mar2012"&gt;{{cite web|title=Obama: The Globalist Ultimate Puppet with Civil Rights Icon Dick Gregory|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVoXIT49qKs|website=The Alex Jones Channel|via=YouTube|date=March 19, 2012|accessdate=August 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jones-1apr2014"&gt;{{cite web|title=Secret Of Malaysia Flight 370: "Brain-Heist"|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XBEKS3bWzc|website=The Alex Jones Channel|via=YouTube|accessdate=August 20, 2017|date=April 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gregory gave the keynote address for Black History Month at [[Bryn Mawr College]] on February 28, 2013.&lt;ref name=Saunders&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lonna-saunders/dick-gregory_b_2756800.html|work=[[HuffPost|The Huffington Post]]|first=Lonna|last=Saunders|title=Dick Gregory: "What I'm Running From" Bryn Mawr College Feb. 28|date=February 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
His take-away message to the students was to never accept injustice.

{{quote|Once I accept injustice, I become injustice. For example, paper mills give off a terrible stench. But the people who work there don't smell it. Remember, Dr. King was assassinated when he went to work for [[Memphis sanitation strike|garbage collectors]]. To help them as workers to enforce their rights. They couldn't smell the stench of the garbage all around them anymore. They were used to it. They would eat their lunch out of a brown bag sitting on the garbage truck. One day, a worker was sitting inside the back of the truck on top of the garbage, and got crushed to death because no one knew he was there.&lt;ref name=Saunders/&gt;}}

Even as late as 2013, Gregory continued to be a ringing voice of the [[Black Power|black power]] movement. Towards the end of his life, he was featured in a Fantagraphics book by Pat Thomas entitled ''Listen, Whitey: The Sights and Sounds of Black Power 1965–1975'', which uses the political recordings of the Civil Rights era to highlight sociopolitical meanings throughout the movement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lightintheattic.net/releases/685-listen-whitey-the-sounds-of-black-power-1967-1974 "Listen, Whitey! The Sounds of Black Power 1967–1974"], Light in the Attic Records.&lt;/ref&gt;  Gregory is known for comedic performances that not only made people laugh, but mocked [[The Establishment|the establishment]]. According to Thomas, Gregory's monologues reflect a time when entertainment needed to be political to be relevant, which is why he included his standup in the collection. Gregory is featured along with the likes of [[Huey P. Newton]], [[Jesse Jackson]], [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], Langston Hughes and Bill Cosby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tom-semioli/listen-to-this-book-the-s_b_4173930.html|work=[[HuffPost|The Huffington Post]]|first=Tom|last=Semioli|title=Listen to This Book: The Sights and Sounds of Black Power 1965–1975|date=October 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They had 11 children (including one son, Richard Jr., who died two months after birth):  Michele, Lynne, Pamela, Paula, Stephanie (also known as Xenobia), Gregory, Christian, Miss, Ayanna, and Yohance.&lt;ref name=Biography/&gt; He was criticized for being an absent father. In a 2000 interview with ''The Boston Globe'', Gregory was quoted as saying, "People ask me about being a father and not being there. I say, 'Jack the Ripper had a father. Hitler had a father. Don't talk to me about family.'"&lt;ref name="globe-24aug2000"/&gt;

==Activism==
===Political activism===

Gregory was active in the [[civil rights movement]]. On October 7, 1963, he came to [[Selma, Alabama]], and spoke for two hours on a public platform two days before the voter registration drive known as "Freedom Day" (October 7, 1963).&lt;ref&gt;[[Howard Zinn]], ''You Can't Be Neutral on a Moving Train''. Beacon Press, 1994; rev. ed. 2002, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, Gregory became more involved in civil rights activities, activism against the [[Vietnam War]], economic reform, and anti-drug issues. As a part of his activism, he went on several [[hunger strike]]s and campaigns in America and overseas. In the early 1970s, he was banned from Australia, where government officials feared he was planning "stir up demonstrations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1696&amp;dat=19710910&amp;id=0LsdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ikYEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7222,2658601|last= Hart |first=Jeffrey  |title=Evonne Goolagong Plays Tennis in South Africa| date=September 10, 1971|work=[[New York Daily News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, Gregory played a role in the search for three [[Murders of Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner|missing civil rights workers]], [[James Chaney]], [[Andrew Goodman]], and [[Michael Schwerner]], who vanished in [[Philadelphia, Mississippi]]. After Gregory and members of [[Congress of Racial Equality|CORE]] met with [[Neshoba County, Mississippi|Neshoba County]] Sheriff [[Lawrence A. Rainey]], Gregory became convinced that the Sheriff's office was complicit. With cash provided by [[Hugh Hefner]], Gregory announced a $25,000 reward for information. The [[FBI]], which had been criticized for inaction, eventually followed suit with its own reward, and the rewards worked. The bodies of the three men were found by the FBI 44 days after they disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=How Dick Gregory Forced the FBI to Find the Bodies of Three Civil Rights Workers Slain in Mississippi|url=http://readersupportednews.org/opinion2/277-75/45776-how-dick-gregory-forced-the-fbi-to-find-the-bodies-of-three-civil-rights-workers-slain-in-mississippi|date=September 14, 2017|accessdate=September 17, 2017|agency=http://readersupportednews.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gregory began his political career by running against [[Richard J. Daley]] for Mayor of Chicago in 1967. Though he did not win, this would not prove to be the end of his participation in electoral politics.&lt;ref name="guardian-19aug2017"&gt;{{cite news|title=Dick Gregory, pioneering US comedian and activist, dies aged 84|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/20/dick-gregory-pioneering-us-comedian-and-activist-dies-aged-84|accessdate=August 20, 2017|agency=[[Associated Press]]|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=August 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gregory ran for President of the United States in 1968 as a [[write-in candidate]] of the Freedom and Peace Party, which had broken off from the [[Peace and Freedom Party]]. He garnered 47,097 votes, including one from [[Hunter S. Thompson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Thompson|first=Hunter S.|authorlink=Hunter S.

His running mate in New Jersey was Dr. David Frost of Plainfield, a biologist, Rutgers professor, and Chairman of NJ SANE (Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy).Famed pediatrician Dr. [[Benjamin Spock]] was the running mate in Virginia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=People's Party Nominates Dr. Spock For President|author=|newspaper=Spartanburg Herald-Journal|date=November 29, 1971|pages=B5|url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Pennsylvania&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Spock, Gregory to Be on Ballot|author=|newspaper=Cape Girardeau Southeast Missourian|date=March 6, 1968|page=10|url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; garnering more than the party he had left.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=1940|title=Our Campaigns - US President National Vote Race - Nov 05, 1968|work=ourcampaigns.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Freedom and Peace Party also ran other candidates, including Beulah Sanders for [[New York State Senate]] and Flora Brown for [[New York State Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourCampaigns.com/PartyDetail.html?PartyID=1597|title=Our Campaigns – Political Party – Freedom &amp; Peace (FPP)|work=ourcampaigns.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; His efforts landed him on the [[master list of Nixon's political opponents]].

Gregory then wrote the book ''Write Me In'' about his presidential campaign. One anecdote in the book relates the story of a publicity stunt that came out of [[Operation Breadbasket]] in Chicago. The campaign had printed dollar bills with Gregory's image on them, some of which made it into circulation, causing considerable problems, but priceless publicity.  The majority of these bills were quickly seized by the federal government.&lt;ref name="root-19aug2017"/&gt; A large contributing factor to the seizure came from the bills resembling authentic United States currency enough that they worked in many dollar-cashing machines of the time. Gregory avoided being charged with a federal crime, later joking that the bills could not really be considered United States currency, because "everyone knows a black man will never be on a U.S. bill."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Evans|first1=Bradford|title=8 Memorable Political Campaigns by Comedians|url=http://splitsider.com/2011/08/8-memorable-political-campaigns-by-comedians/|accessdate=24 August 2017|publisher=Splitsider|date=31 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after this time, Gregory became an outspoken critic of the [[John F. Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories|findings]] of the [[Warren Commission]] concerning the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]] by [[Lee Harvey Oswald]]. On March 6, 1975, Gregory and assassination researcher [[Robert J. Groden]] appeared on [[Geraldo Rivera]]'s late night ABC talk show ''Goodnight America''. An important historical event happened that night when the famous [[Zapruder film]] of JFK's assassination was shown to the public on TV for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|4DwKK4rkeEM|Zapruder film on Good Night America – 3/6/75 Robert Groden and Dick Gregory}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The public's response and outrage to its showing led to the forming of the Hart-Schweiker investigation, which contributed to the [[Church Committee]] Investigation on Intelligence Activities by the United States, which resulted in the [[United States House Select Committee on Assassinations]] investigation.

Gregory was an outspoken feminist, and in 1978 joined [[Gloria Steinem]], [[Betty Friedan]], [[Bella Abzug]], [[Margaret Heckler]], [[Barbara Mikulski]], and other suffragists to lead the ''National ERA March for Ratification and Extension'', a march down [[Pennsylvania Avenue]] to the [[United States Capitol]] of over 100,000 on [[Women's Equality Day]] (August 26), 1978, to demonstrate for a ratification deadline extension for the proposed [[Equal Rights Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution]], and for the ratification of the ERA.&lt;ref name="vibe-19aug2017"&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Muhammad|first1=Latifah|title=Dick Gregory, Comedic Legend And Civil Rights Activist, Dead At 84|url=https://www.vibe.com/2017/08/dick-gregory-comedian-activist-dead-at-84/|accessdate=August 20, 2017|magazine=[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]|date=August 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The march was ultimately successful in extending the deadline to June 30, 1982, and Gregory joined other activists to the Senate for celebration and victory speeches by pro-ERA Senators, Members of Congress, and activists. The ERA narrowly failed to be ratified by the extended ratification date.

On July 21, 1979, Gregory appeared at the [[Amandla Festival]] where [[Bob Marley]], [[Patti LaBelle]], and [[Eddie Palmieri]], amongst others, performed.&lt;ref name="boston-24may2017"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Eaton|first1=Perry|title=Long before Boston Calling, there was the Amandla Festival|url=https://www.boston.com/culture/music/2017/05/24/long-before-boston-calling-amandla-festival-brought-bob-marley-and-social-justice-to-harvard|website=[[Boston.com]]|accessdate=August 20, 2017|date=May 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gregory gave a speech before Marley's performance, blaming President [[Jimmy Carter|Carter]], and showing his support for the international [[Anti-Apartheid Movement]]. Gregory and Mark Lane conducted landmark research into the [[Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.|assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.]], helping move the U.S. House Select Assassinations Committee to investigate the murder, along with [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|that of John F. Kennedy]]. Lane was the author of conspiracy theory books such as ''[[Rush to Judgment]]''. The pair wrote the King conspiracy book ''Code Name Zorro'', which postulated that convicted assassin [[James Earl Ray]] did not act alone. Gregory also argued that the moon landing was faked and the commonly accepted account of the 9/11 attacks is incorrect, among other conspiracy theories.&lt;ref name="Wiley"/&gt;&lt;ref name="npr.org"/&gt;

Gregory was an outspoken activist during the [[Iran hostage crisis|US Embassy Hostage Crisis in Iran]]. In 1980, he traveled to [[Tehran]] to attempt to negotiate the hostages' release and engaged in a public hunger strike there, weighing less than 100 pounds (45&amp;nbsp;kg) when he returned to the United States.&lt;ref name="latimes-19aug2017"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-me-dick-gregory-20170819-story.html|title=Dick Gregory, who rose from poverty to become a groundbreaking comedian and civil rights activist, dies at 84|author=Dennis McLellahn|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=August 19, 2017|date=August 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:WIKI - Dick Gregory 1995.jpg|thumb|right|In October 1995 Gregory returned to the Broadway stage to perform comedy once again after a 23-year absence.]]

In 1998, Gregory spoke at the celebration of the birthday of Dr Martin Luther King Jr., with President [[Bill Clinton]] in attendance. Not long after, the President told Gregory's long-time friend and public relations consultant [[Steve Jaffe]], "I love Dick Gregory; he is one of the funniest people on the planet." They spoke of how Gregory had made a comment on Dr. King's birthday that broke everyone into laughter, when he noted that the President made Speaker [[Newt Gingrich]] ride "in the back of the plane," on an Air Force One trip overseas.&lt;ref name="cnn-15jan1996"&gt;{{cite news|title=Clinton leads tribute to King|url=http://edition.cnn.com/US/9601/mlk/clinton/|accessdate=August 20, 2017|newspaper=[[CNN]]|date=January 15, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gregory was diagnosed with [[lymphoma]] in late 1999. He said he was treating the cancer with herbs, vitamins, and exercise, which he believed kept the cancer in remission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://findArticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1355/is_26_97/ai_62685512|title=Dick Gregory Talks About His Fight With Cancer|work=[[Jet (magazine)|Jet]]|date=June 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the mid-1980s, Gregory was a figure in the [[health food]] industry by advocating for a raw fruit and vegetable diet. He wrote the introduction to Viktoras Kulvinskas' book ''Survival into the 21st Century''. Gregory first became a vegetarian in the 1960s and lost a considerable amount of weight by going on extreme fasts, some lasting upwards of 50 days. He developed a diet drink called "Bahamian Diet Nutritional Drink" and went on TV shows advocating his diet and to help the morbidly obese.&lt;ref name="guardian-19aug2017"/&gt;

In 2003, Gregory and [[Cornel West]] wrote letters on behalf of [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] (PETA) to [[KFC|Kentucky Fried Chicken]]'s CEO, asking that the company improve its animal-handling procedures.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3190/is_47_37/ai_111013629/ PETA Recruits Comedian, Activist in Anti-KFC Push]," ''Nation's Restaurant News'', November 24, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

At a civil rights rally marking the 40th anniversary of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], Gregory criticized the United States, calling it "the most dishonest, ungodly, unspiritual nation that ever existed in the history of the planet. As we talk now, America is 5 percent of the world's population and consumes 96 percent of the world's hard drugs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsMax.com/archives/ic/2005/8/8/102152.shtml|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120909184044/http://www.newsmax.com/archives/ic/2005/8/8/102152.shtml|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2012-09-09|title=Newsmax.com – Breaking news from around the globe: U.S. news, politics, world, health, finance, video, science, technology, live news stream|author=Newsmax|work=newsmax.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Gregory stated he believed that air pollution and intentional water contamination with heavy metals such as lead and possibly manganese may be being used against black Americans, especially in urban neighborhoods, and that such factors could be contributing to high levels of violence in black communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/dick-gregory-blasts-insane-racist-system-america|title=Dick Gregory Blasts 'Insane, Racist System' in America|date=July 7, 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 10, 2010, Gregory announced that he was going on a hunger strike. In a commentary that was published by the [[Centre for Research on Globalisation]] Web site in Montreal, he said that he doubted the official U.S. report about the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001.

=== Health Enterprises, Inc. ===
In 1984, he founded Health Enterprises, Inc., a company that distributed weight-loss products. With this company, Gregory made efforts to improve the life expectancy of African Americans, which he believed was being hindered by poor nutrition and drug and alcohol abuse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaregistry.org/historic_events/view/dick-gregory-funny-blunt-civil-rights-advocate "Dick Gregory, Funny, Blunt Civil Rights Advocate"], African American Registry.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985, Gregory introduced the "Slim-Safe Bahamian Diet", a powdered-diet mix.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]'', August 1985, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; He launched the weight-loss powder at the Whole Life Expo in Boston under the slogan "It's cool to be healthy". The diet mix, if drunk three times a day, was said to provide rapid weight loss. Gregory received a multimillion-dollar distribution contract to retail the diet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20088677,00.html "The Dick Gregory Diet: Lose Weight Fast – Without Fasting – and Get (Him) Rich Quick"], ''People'' archive, September 17, 1984, Vol. 22, No. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, the Ethiopian government adopted, to reported success, Gregory's formula to combat malnutrition during a period of famine in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=abADAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA13&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;dq=dick+gregory+%22united+nations%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=LY5yawosmc&amp;sig=fKLB4kzI0YZ2BepHQkeJgyHlR-c&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjByrywjujVAhWI6iYKHdymA_8Q6AEIPDAE#v=onepage&amp;q=dick%20gregory%20%22united%20nations%22&amp;f=false|title=Jet|last=Company|first=Johnson Publishing|date=1985-05-27|publisher=Johnson Publishing Company|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gregory's clients included [[Muhammad Ali]].&lt;ref name="vecono" /&gt;

In 2014, Dick Gregory updated his original 4X formula, which was the basis for the Bahamian Diet and created his new and improved "Caribbean Diet for Optimal Health".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Caribbean Diet|url=http://www.wellnessinnature.com/|access-date=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of his health treatments have been described as "unorthodox" and "profitable rot".&lt;ref name="vecono" /&gt;
