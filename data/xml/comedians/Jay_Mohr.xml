==Career==

===Acting career===
Mohr appeared as a featured player for the [[1993-94 American network television schedule|1993–94]] and [[1994-95 American network television schedule|1994–95]] seasons of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. His [[memoir]], ''[[Gasping for Airtime: Two Years in the Trenches of Saturday Night Live]]'' (Hyperion Books, 2004), details this tumultuous period of his life, including his battle with chronic [[panic attack]]s.&lt;ref name= Gasping&gt;{{cite book| title= Gasping for Airtime: Two Years in the Trenches of Saturday Night Live| first= Jay |last= Mohr| publisher= Hyperion Books| year= 2004| isbn= 9781401300067}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later credited his ''SNL'' co-star [[Sarah Silverman]] with saving his life by helping him treat the problem.

Mohr had a recurring role in the first season of ''[[The Jeff Foxworthy Show]]'' as [[Jeff Foxworthy]]'s brother, Wayne. Mohr's first major film role was in 1996 when he played the conniving Bob Sugar, a sleazy sports agent in ''[[Jerry Maguire]]'', followed in 1997 by a starring role in ''[[Picture Perfect (1997 film)|Picture Perfect]]''. In 1999, Mohr starred in the television series ''[[Action (TV series)|Action]]'', in which he played sleazy film producer Peter Dragon. He was the voice-over artist for [[Fox Sports Net]]'s ''[[Beyond the Glory]]''. Mohr appeared in additional movies including ''[[Suicide Kings]]'', ''[[Are We There Yet? (film)|Are We There Yet?]]'', ''[[Small Soldiers]]'', ''[[Go (1999)|Go]]'', ''[[Pay It Forward (film)|Pay It Forward]]'', and ''[[The Groomsmen]]''.  Mohr was offered a late night talk show job by [[Michael Eisner]], but he declined, instead convincing Eisner to let him host a talk show on [[ESPN]], ''Mohr Sports,'' which ran briefly in 2001 before being cancelled. The talk show job Mohr passed was then offered to [[Jimmy Kimmel]] and became ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://smodcast.com/episodes/get-a-helmet/ |title=Get A Helmet |publisher=SModcast |date= |accessdate=2012-05-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120519201217/http://smodcast.com/episodes/get-a-helmet/ |archivedate=2012-05-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 and 2004, Mohr created, hosted, and was [[executive producer]] of [[NBC]]'s ''[[Last Comic Standing]]'' [[reality television]] program. The show aired for three seasons, but was cancelled near the end of the third season due to poor ratings, only to be renewed later. Mohr was very vocal toward NBC concerning its cancellation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realityblurred.com/realitytv/archives/last_comic_standing_3/2004_Oct_08_finale_pulled |title= Last Comic Standing 3 finale pulled, maybe; Jay Mohr didn't want third season |first= Andy |last= Dehnart |work= RealityBlurred.com |date= 2004-10-08 |accessdate= 2012-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and did not return for the show's fourth season in 2006. Mohr was replaced with new host [[Anthony Clark (actor)|Anthony Clark]], but was credited as a [[consultant]]. On the season finale of ''Last Comic Standing 4'', Mohr performed as a guest comedian. His recurring role on the TV series ''[[Ghost Whisperer]]'' developed into a regular role. He appeared in "[[My Own Private Practice Guy]]", a 2003 episode of the sitcom ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]'', and in three episodes of ''[[An Khe (The West Wing)|The West Wing]]'' in 2004 in the recurring role of Taylor Reid. Parts of Mohr's stand up was featured in Comedy Central's animated series ''[[Shorties Watchin' Shorties]]''.

Mohr starred as newly divorced father Gary Brooks, the title character, for two seasons on the CBS sitcom ''[[Gary Unmarried]]''. [[Paula Marshall]] played his ex-wife. In January 2010 he took the role as Billy in [[Clint Eastwood]]'s thriller film ''[[Hereafter (film)|Hereafter]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/35553/jay-mohr-see-light-hereafter |title=Jay Mohr to See the Light of the Hereafter |author=Uncle Creepy |website=Dreadcentral.com |date=January 27, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100129081719/http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/35553/jay-mohr-see-light-hereafter |archivedate=January 29, 2010 |accessdate=August 8, 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also guest-starred on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Outlaw (TV series)|Outlaw]]'' in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Jay-Mohr-Outlaw-1021791.aspx|title=Jay Mohr Gets Serious on NBC's Outlaw| work= [[TV Guide|TVGuide.com]] | first= William| last= Keck | date= August 12, 2010| accessdate= August 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radio===
Mohr has contributed frequently to ''[[The Jim Rome Show]]'' and often guest-hosted the program. His nickname on the show is "Slam Man," and, more recently, the derisive "Weigh More" and "[[Ham]] Man," "[[Salami]] Man" and—when feeling particularly fancy -- "[[Prosciutto]] Man."  Mohr finished in 7th place in the 2007 [[Smack-Off]], 6th place in the 2008 Smack-Off, 10th place in the 2009 Smack-Off, 6th place in the 2010 Smack-Off, and 6th place in the 2011 Smack-Off. Mohr is also known to do "drive-by" call-ins to the show, typically to promote one of his stand-up shows or live events.

On January 2, 2013, Mohr replaced Rome on [[Fox Sports Radio]], as he hosts a daily talk show titled ''Jay Mohr Sports'' in Rome's longtime 12 to 3 p.m. (ET) timeslot, as Rome moved his show from [[Premiere Networks]] (the distributor of Fox Sports Radio) to [[CBS Sports Radio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rbr.com/fox-sports-radio-adds-jay-mohr-for-middays/|title=Fox Sports Radio adds Jay Mohr for middays - Radio &amp; Television Business Report|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show can be heard on several internet platforms and regional affiliates. On November 3, 2014, Jay Mohr Sports moved to the 3 to 6pm time slot, so [[Rich Eisen]] could take over the 12-3pm slot on Fox Sports Radio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://awfulannouncing.com/2014/fox-sports-radio-will-picking-rich-eisen-show.html|title=Fox Sports Radio will be picking up The Rich Eisen Show|work=Awful Announcing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Podcast===
Mohr hosts his own podcast titled ''Mohr Stories''. The podcast was hosted on the [[SModcast.com|SModcast Network]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Mohr Stories: Episode 1 | url=http://smodcast.com/episodes/put-your-name-on-it/ | work=Smodcast.com | year=2011 | accessdate=2011-07-21 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724085225/http://smodcast.com/episodes/put-your-name-on-it/ | archivedate=2011-07-24 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; often taped in his garage, which he has dubbed Fake Mustache Studios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Mohr Stories: Episode 2 | url=http://smodcast.com/episodes/put-your-name-on-it/ | work=Smodcast.com | year=2011 | accessdate=2011-07-21 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724085225/http://smodcast.com/episodes/put-your-name-on-it/ | archivedate=2011-07-24 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On May 4, 2012, Mohr announced his amicable departure from the SModcast network. He has since begun hosting ''Mohr Stories'' on his own network, Fake Mustache Studios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Jay Mohr's Twitter Account | url=https://twitter.com/jaymohr37/status/198453132446015490 | work=Twitter | accessdate=2012-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other work===

In May 2010, publisher [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] released Mohr's second book, ''No Wonder My Parents Drank: Tales from a Stand-Up Dad''.

Mohr's album ''Happy.

In 2016, Mohr became the host of the [[Los Angeles Rams]] pregame show airing Saturday evenings after [[Saturday Night Football|college football]] on [[KABC-TV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ABC7, LA Rams, Jay Mohr team up for new primetime sports show|url=http://abc7.com/sports/abc7-la-rams-jay-mohr-team-up-for-new-primetime-sports-show/1470650/|website=KABC-TV|accessdate=12 September 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817195224/http://abc7.com/sports/abc7-la-rams-jay-mohr-team-up-for-new-primetime-sports-show/1470650/|archivedate=17 August 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was replaced as the host in November 2016 with no explanation.{{Citation needed|reason=No evidence it is permanent or official|date=November 2016}}
