== Ticketing innovation ==
C.K. innovated direct-to-consumer distribution in 2001 when he released his debut comedy album, ''[[Live in Houston (Louis C.K. album)|Live in Houston]]'', directly through his website. He became one of the first performers to use his website to offer direct-to-fan ticket sales to his stand-up shows, as well as [[Digital rights management|DRM]]-free video concert downloads.&lt;ref name="Slate-Hulu-CharlieRose-2014" /&gt;  In this way, C.K. sold tickets for his stand-up tour, circumventing large [[Primary ticket outlet|ticket outlets]] (e.g., [[Ticketmaster]]) by bypassing their overhead and the venues they control.&lt;ref name="NYT-Joke-2013" /&gt; C.K. has said the ticket outlets create barriers to consumers, whereas direct distribution is easy—and has effectively "closed the gap between how easy it was to steal it [versus] how easy it was to buy it".&lt;ref name="Slate-Hulu-CharlieRose-2014"&gt;{{cite web|last=Haglund|first=David|title=Watch Louis C.K.

== Philanthropy ==
In 2011, by selling ''[[Live at the Beacon Theater]]'' on his website, C.K. earned a "million dollars in a matter of days, half of which he [gave] away to his staff and charities."&lt;ref name=reuters&gt;{{cite news|last1=Molloy|first1=Tim|title=How comedian Louis C.K. made $1M and gave half away|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-louisck-idUSTRE7BM1R120111223|accessdate=5 April 2016|agency=Reuters|date=Dec 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recipients included [[Fistula Foundation|the Fistula Foundation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Grant|first1=Kate|title=Angel in Disguise|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kate-grant/fistula-foundation-louis-ck_b_1182044.html|website=Huffington Post|accessdate=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Green Chimneys, [[Pablove Foundation|the Pablove Foundation]], [[Charity: Water]], and [[Kiva (organization)|Kiva]].&lt;ref name="reuters" /&gt; In 2016, he selected the Fistula Foundation as the beneficiary of his ''[[Jeopardy!]]'' Power Players Week appearance, and won $50,000 for the charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2016 Power Players Week Contestants Announced|url=https://www.jeopardy.com/jbuzz/news/power-players-contestants-announced|website=Jeopardy!|accessdate=6 April 2016|date=30 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political views ==
About political partisanship, C.K. states: {{cquote|Some things I think are very [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]], or very [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]]. I think when someone falls into one category for everything, I'm very suspicious.

In March 2016, C.K. sent an email to those subscribed to his mailing list with his opinion about the 2016 presidential race. He said he wanted a conservative president but criticized [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] presidential candidate [[Donald Trump]] as being like [[Adolf Hitler]]. He said Trump is an "insane bigot" even though he has captivating qualities. C.K. added, "He's not a monster.
