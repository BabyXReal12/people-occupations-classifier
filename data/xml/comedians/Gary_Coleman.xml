'''Gary Wayne Coleman''' (February 8, 1968 – May 28, 2010) was an American actor, comedian, and writer best known for his role as [[Arnold Jackson (character)|Arnold Jackson]] in ''[[Diff'rent Strokes]]'' (1978–1986). He was described in the 1980s as "one of television's most promising stars".{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} After a successful [[Child actor|childhood acting]] career, Coleman struggled financially later in life. In 1989, he successfully sued his parents and business adviser over misappropriation of his assets, only to declare bankruptcy a decade later. On May 28, 2010, Coleman died of an [[subdural hematoma]] at age 42.

== Early life==
Gary Wayne Coleman was born&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.scotsman.com/obituaries/Obituary-Gary-Coleman-actor.6329572.jp |title=Scotsman obituary |publisher=News.scotsman.com |date= May 31, 2010|accessdate=August 11, 2010 |location=Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Zion, Illinois]], outside [[Chicago]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nndb.com/people/990/000022924/ | title=Gary Coleman | publisher=[[NNDB]] | accessdate=4 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; on February 8, 1968. He was adopted by W. G. Coleman, a fork-lift operator, and Edmonia Sue, a nurse practitioner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/21/Gary-Coleman.html |title=Gary Coleman Biography (1968–) |publisher=Filmreference.com |date= |accessdate=May 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to [[focal segmental glomerulosclerosis]] (a congenital chronic [[kidney]] disease), and the [[corticosteroid]]s and other medications used to treat it, his growth was limited to {{convert|4|ft|8|in|abbr=on|cm|}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/may/29/local/la-me-gary-coleman-20100529 |title=Gary Coleman dies at 42; child star of hit sitcom 'Diff'rent Strokes' |first=Dennis |last=McLellan |date=May 29, 2010 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=July 21, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and his face retained a childlike appearance well into adulthood. He underwent two unsuccessful [[Kidney transplantation|kidney transplants]] in 1973 and 1984, and required frequent [[dialysis]].&lt;ref name=thewrap /&gt;

== Career ==
In 1974, Coleman's career began when he appeared in a commercial for [[Harris Bank]]. His line (after the announcer said, "You should have a Harris banker.") was "You should have a Hubert doll."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_vQ98mLpdg Gary Coleman's first television commercial: Harris Bank (1974)]&lt;/ref&gt; "Hubert" was a stuffed lion representing the Harris bank logo.&lt;ref name=Careerstart /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2010-05-28/entertainment/ct-live-0529-gary-coleman-obit-local-20100528_1_gary-coleman-edmonia-sue-coleman-diffrent-strokes |title='Diff'rent Strokes' child star, Zion, Ill. native Gary Coleman dead at 42 - Chicago Tribune |publisher=Articles.chicagotribune.com |date=May 28, 2010 |accessdate=2012-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, he appeared in an episode of ''[[Medical Center (TV series)|Medical Center]]''.&lt;ref name=Careerstart&gt;{{cite news|last=Hayward |first=Anthony |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/gary-coleman-child-star-of-the-television-sitcom-diffrent-strokes-who-faced-legal-and-personal-problems-in-later-life-1987910.html |title=Gary Coleman: Child star of the television sitcom 'Diff'rent Strokes' who faced legal and personal problems in later life - Obituaries - News |publisher=The Independent |date=June 1, 2010 |accessdate=2012-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While best known for his role on ''[[Diff'rent Strokes]]'', Coleman had appeared earlier on television, on ''[[The Jeffersons]]'' as Raymond, George Jefferson's nephew, and on ''[[Good Times]]'' as Penny's friend Gary. He also appeared in a 1977 pilot for a revival of ''[[The Little Rascals]]'' as Stymie.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2010/SHOWBIZ/TV/05/28/obit.gary.coleman/index.html?section=cnn_latest {{" '}}Diff'rent Strokes actor Gary Coleman dies at 42."] CNN May 28, 2010 article added May 28, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; [[VH1]] rated Coleman first on a list of "100 Greatest Child Stars" on television.&lt;ref name="reuters"/&gt;

=== ''Diff'rent Strokes'' ===
Coleman was cast in the role of [[Arnold Jackson (character)|Arnold Jackson]] in ''[[Diff'rent Strokes]]'', portraying one of two black brothers from [[Harlem]] adopted by a wealthy white widower in [[Manhattan]]. The series was broadcast from 1978 to 1986.

He became the most popular fixture of the series, enhanced by his character's catchphrase "What'chu talkin' 'bout, Willis?". At the height of his fame on ''Diff'rent Strokes'', he earned $100,000 per episode. A [[Biography Channel]] documentary estimated he was left with a quarter of the original amount after paying his parents, advisers, lawyers, and taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=''Gilligan's Island'' &amp; ''Diff'rent Strokes'' |series=The Truth Behind the Sitcom Scandals |network=[[The Biography Channel]] |date=April 15, 2008 |season=1 |number=5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He later successfully sued his parents and his former advisers for misappropriation of his finances and was awarded $1.3&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Judge tells parents to pay young actor | date = February 24, 1993 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1893&amp;dat=19930224&amp;id=pa4fAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=D9cEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1809,6280883 | agency=Associated Press |accessdate=January 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Todd Bridges]]' autobiography ''Killing Willis'', Coleman was made to work long hours on the set of ''Diff'rent Strokes'', despite his age and health problems and this contributed to his being unhappy and separating himself from the cast.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

=== Later character appearances ===
Coleman became a popular figure, starring in a number of feature films and television films, including ''[[The Kid from Left Field (1979 film)|The Kid from Left Field]]'' (1979), ''[[On the Right Track]]'' (1981) and ''[[The Kid with the Broken Halo]]'' (1982). The latter eventually served as the basis for ''[[The Gary Coleman Show]]'' in 1982. He also made video game appearances in ''[[The Curse of Monkey Island]]'' (1997) and ''[[Postal 2]]'' (2003). In 2005, Coleman appeared in [[John Cena]]'s music video for his single "Bad, Bad Man" (from the album ''[[You Can't See Me]]''), Coleman played himself as a villain taking [[Michael Jackson]] and [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] hostage. The video was a spoof of 80s culture, focusing on ''[[The A-Team]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[You Can't See Me]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8Kt2jHnMh0 |title=John Cena Bad Bad Man |publisher=YouTube |date=December 15, 2006 |accessdate=2012-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Candidacy for Governor of California ==
In the [[2003 California recall|2003 California recall election]], Coleman was a candidate for [[Governor of California|governor]]. This campaign was sponsored by the free newsweekly ''[[East Bay Express]]'' as a satirical comment on the recall. After [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] declared his candidacy, Coleman announced that he would vote for Schwarzenegger. Coleman placed [[California recall election results, 2003|8th in a field of 135 candidates]], receiving 14,242 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/08/06/candidate.coleman/index.html|title=Gary Coleman on California ballot|publisher=CNN/inside politics|date=August 7, 2003|accessdate=May 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Avenue Q'' ==
Coleman is parodied in ''[[Avenue Q]]'', which won the 2004 [[Tony Award for Best Musical]]. A fictionalized version of Coleman works as the [[building superintendent|superintendent]] of the apartment complex where the musical takes place.  In the song "It Sucks to Be Me", he laments his fate.&lt;ref name=thewrap&gt;Horowitz, Lisa. {{cite web|url=http://www.thewrap.com/ind-column/gary-coleman-dead-42-17857 |title=Gary Coleman Dead at 42|work=[[The Wrap]]|date= May 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Broadway, the role was originated by [[Natalie Venetia Belcon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ibdb.com/person.php?id=100641 |title= Natalie Venetia Belcon |website= Internet Broadway Database |accessdate=May 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show's creators, Jeff Marx and Robert Lopez, have said the Coleman character personifies one of ''Avenue Q'''s central themes: that as children we are told we are "special", but upon entering adulthood we discover that life is not nearly as easy as we have been led to believe. They added that their original intent was for Coleman himself to play the Gary Coleman role, and he expressed interest in accepting it but never showed up for a meeting scheduled to discuss it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Dobbs |first=Aaron |url=http://gothamist.com/2004/12/17/jeff_marx_robert_lopez_creators_avenue_q.php |title=Jeff Marx &amp; Robert Lopez, Creators Avenue Q |website=Gothamist |date=December 17, 2004 |accessdate=May 30, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080709004354/http://gothamist.com/2004/12/17/jeff_marx_robert_lopez_creators_avenue_q.php |archivedate=July 9, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Coleman announced his intention to sue the producers of ''Avenue Q'' for their depiction of him, although the lawsuit never materialized. At the 2007 [[New York Comic Con]], Coleman said, "I wish there was a lawyer on Earth that would sue them for me."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPCOuyGacRs |title=Gary Coleman&amp;nbsp;– New York Comic Con 2007&amp;nbsp;– |website=TheActionRoom.com |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=May 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
In a 1993 television interview, Coleman said he had twice attempted suicide by overdosing on pills.&lt;ref name="msnbc"&gt;{{cite news |first=Jennifer |last=Dobner |url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/37386129/ns/today-entertainment/ |title= Former child star Gary Coleman dies at 42 |agency=Associated Press |date=May 28, 2010 |accessdate=May 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same time{{Clarify|date=June 2011}} he was living in [[Denver, Colorado]], where he hosted a Sunday night show on local radio station KHIH (now [[KPTT]]) titled ''Gary Coleman's Colorado High'', in which he played light [[jazz]] and [[new-age music]]. He gave part of his salary to the Colorado Kidney Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/68504/GARY-COLEMAN--LITTLE-ARNOLD-HAS-GROWN-UP.html?pg=all|title=GARY COLEMAN:  LITTLE 'ARNOLD' HAS GROWN UP|date=1989-10-17|newspaper=DeseretNews.com|access-date=2016-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Coleman moved from [[Los Angeles]] to [[Santaquin, Utah|Santaquin]], a small town about 50 miles (80 km) south of [[Salt Lake City, Utah]], where he lived for the remainder of his life.&lt;ref name="Tel ill"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/celebritynews/7775136/Diffrent-Strokes-star-Gary-Coleman-critically-ill-in-hospital.html |title=Diff'rent Strokes star Gary Coleman critically ill in hospital |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=May 28, 2010 |accessdate=August 11, 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2007, he met Shannon Price, 22, on the set of the film ''[[Church Ball]]'', where she was working as an [[Extra (actor)|extra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Death &amp; Celebrity: When Gary Met Shannon |date=June 15, 2010|url=http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/home/49749343-73/coleman-price-gary-utah.html.csp|work= Salt Lake Tribune|accessdate=  July 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Price and Coleman married several months later.&lt;ref name="MTVNews"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.ca/news/article.jhtml?id=7059|title=Afternoon Fix: Celebrity Birthdays, the 'Jumper' Movie Minute, the latest news, and more|date=February 14, 2008|website=[[MTV News]]|accessdate=June 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On May 1 and 2, 2008, they made a well-publicized appearance on the show ''[[Divorce Court]]''&lt;ref name=Divorce&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/2008/04/25/2008-04-25_newlywed_gary_coleman_brings_marital_woe.html|author=Sandy Cohen|title=Newlywed Gary Coleman brings marital woes to 'Divorce Court'|date=April 25, 2008|work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; to air their differences in an attempt to save their marriage. Nevertheless, they divorced in August 2008, and Coleman was granted an ''ex parte'' restraining order against Price to prevent her from living in his home when he was hospitalized after their divorce.&lt;ref name="Mayoras2012"&gt;{{cite news|authors=Mayoras, Danielle &amp;  Mayoras, Andy |date=2012|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/trialandheirs/2012/05/17/court-rules-against-gary-colemans-ex-finds-she-abused-and-cheated-on-him/ |title=Court Rules Against Gary Coleman's Ex, Finds She Abused And Cheated On Him|work=Forbes|accessdate= 25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a court petition later filed by Price, she and Coleman continued to live together in a [[common-law marriage]] until his death.&lt;ref name="SLT"&gt;{{cite news|title=Gary Coleman wasn't married when he died |author=Vince Horiuchi |newspaper=The Salt Lake Tribune |date=June 2, 2010 |url=http://www.sltrib.com/D=g/ci_15214072 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150409014505/http://www.sltrib.com/D%3Dg/ci_15214072 |archivedate=April 9, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a judge ultimately ruled against Price after hearing evidence that she carried on affairs with other men during the time she claimed to be with Coleman, and "physically abused Coleman in public, led him around by the hand like a child [and] displayed no physical affection toward him in front of anyone."&lt;ref name="Mayoras2012"/&gt;

=== Financial struggles ===
In August 1999, Coleman filed for [[bankruptcy]] protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1355/is_14_96/ai_55983426 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120714014405/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1355/is_14_96/ai_55983426 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 14, 2012 |title=Former Child Star Gary Coleman Files For Bankruptcy |work=[[Jet (magazine)|Jet]] |date=September 6, 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple people, he said, were responsible for his insolvency, "from me, to accountants, to my adoptive parents, to agents, to lawyers, and back to me again."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gary Coleman: Bankrupt |date=August 18, 1999|url=http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/b38590_gary_coleman_bankrupt.html |work=eonline.com|accessdate= July 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He lost $200,000 on an arcade he named the Gary Coleman Game Parlor, which was located at [[Fisherman's Village]] in [[Marina del Rey, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Out of Pocket |date=September 6, 1999|url=https://people.com/archive/out-of-pocket-vol-52-no-9/ |work=people.com|accessdate= August 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gary Coleman|date=April 15, 2016|url=https://people.com/archive/out-of-pocket-vol-52-no-9/ |work=happeningsmagazine.com|accessdate= August 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ongoing medical expenses contributed significantly to Coleman's chronic financial problems and compelled him, at times, to resort to unusual fundraising activities. In 1999, he partnered with [[UGO Networks]] on an online auction titled Save Me! Items included his couch, a "tiny pimp suit" with matching gold Nikes and an autographed ice scraper. Items attracted more than $5,000 in bids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Short Orders |date=November 23, 1999|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/1999/nov/24/tvandradio.television1 |work=theguardian.com|accessdate= August 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, he auctioned an autographed pair of his pants on [[eBay]] to help pay his medical bills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gary Coleman struggling to shed child star image |date=February 26, 2008|url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/23352686/ |work=Today Show Archive|accessdate= July 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The auction attracted considerable attention, including fake bids up to $400,000. The pants were eventually bought for $500 by comedian [[Jimmy Kimmel]], who hung them from the rafters of his television studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Coleman Pants Suit Kimmel |date=January 29, 2008|url=http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/b57340_Coleman_Pants_Suit_Kimmel.html |work=eonline.com|accessdate= July 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legal troubles ===
In 1989, Coleman sued his adoptive parents and former business advisor for $3.8&amp;nbsp;million, for misappropriating his trust fund,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://members.tripod.com/~former_child_star/news_1999.html |title=Former Child Star Central |website=Members.tripod.com |date=June 29, 1999 |accessdate=May 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TDG"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-hYxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=PuEFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4011,5595796&amp;dq=gary+coleman&amp;hl=en|title=Gary Coleman awarded $1.3M|date=February 25, 1993|agency=Associated Press|work=[[The Daily Gazette]]|accessdate=May 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and won a $1,280,000 judgment in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xboDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA35&amp;lpg=PA35&amp;dq=%22Actor+Gary+Coleman+wins+$1.3+million+in+suit+against+his+parents+and+ex-adviser%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=UGAGu49Erg&amp;sig=44dvqRrgxIcuL9ZaLO7n6Uysneg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Mm02VPDbLM2kyAS32YHYBQ&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Actor%20Gary%20Coleman%20wins%20%241.3%20million%20in%20suit%20against%20his%20parents%20and%20ex-adviser%22&amp;f=false |title=Actor Gary Coleman wins $1.3&amp;nbsp;million in suit against his parents and ex-adviser|work=[[Jet (magazine)|Jet]]|date=March 15, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, Coleman was charged with assault while he was working as a security guard. Tracy Fields, a Los Angeles bus driver and fan of Coleman's work on ''Diff'rent Strokes'', approached him in a California mall and requested his autograph, while Coleman was shopping for a [[bulletproof vest]]. Coleman refused to give her an autograph, an argument ensued, and Fields reportedly mocked Coleman's lackluster career as an actor. Coleman then punched Fields in the face several times in front of witnesses. He was arrested and later testified in court that she threatened him, and he defended himself. "She wouldn't leave me alone. I was getting scared, and she was getting ugly," he said. Coleman pleaded [[Nolo contendere|no contest]] to one count of assault, received a suspended jail sentence, and was ordered to pay Fields' $1,665 hospital bill, as well as take [[anger management]] classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courttv.com/archive/trials/coleman/020499.html |title=Coleman pleads no contest to disturbing the peace and receives 90-day suspended sentence |website=[[Court TV|Court TV Online]] |date=February 4, 1999 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219015819/http://www.courttv.com/archive/trials/coleman/020499.html |archivedate=December 19, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courttv.com/archive/trials/coleman/020499.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219015819/http://www.courttv.com/archive/trials/coleman/020499.html |archivedate=December 19, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title=Gary Coleman arrested on domestic assault warrant|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/gary-coleman-arrested-utah-domestic-assault-warrant-jail-working-bail-article-1.196183|accessdate=April 4, 2015|date=January 24, 2010|work=New York Daily News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Coleman was cited for [[misdemeanor]] [[disorderly conduct]] in [[Provo, Utah]], after a "heated discussion" in public with his wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SLTB&amp;p_theme=sltb&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;s_dispstring=allfields(Diff'rent%20Strokes'%20star%20Coleman%20cited%20for%20disorderly%20conduct%20in%20Utah%20County)%20AND%20date(1/1/2010%20to%201/1/1998)&amp;p_field_date-0=YMD_date&amp;p_params_date-0=date:B,E&amp;p_text_date-0=1/1/2010%20to%201/1/1998)&amp;p_field_advanced-0=&amp;p_text_advanced-0=(%22Diff'rent%20Strokes'%20star%20Coleman%20cited%20for%20disorderly%20conduct%20in%20Utah%20County%22)&amp;xcal_numdocs=20&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;xcal_useweights=no |title=Diff'rent Strokes' star Coleman cited for disorderly conduct in Utah County|work= [[Fox News]]|date=July 31, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.insideedition.com/news.aspx?storyID=1289 |title=Gary Coleman reveals Secret Marriage|work=[[Inside Edition]]|date= February 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Coleman was involved in a car accident after an altercation at a [[Payson, Utah]] bowling alley, which began when Colt Rushton, age 24, photographed Coleman without his permission. The two men argued, according to witnesses. In the parking lot, Coleman allegedly backed his truck into Rushton, striking his knee and pulling him under the vehicle, before hitting another car. Rushton was treated at a local hospital for minor injuries and released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ksl.com/?nid=148&amp;sid=4198739 |title=Man run over by former child star in Payson|work=[[KSL-TV]]|date=September 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://deseretnews.com/article/1,5143,700257308,00.html |title=Payson police say no one's talking in Coleman incident |work=[[Deseret News]]|date=September 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coleman later pleaded [[Nolo contendere|no contest]] to charges of disorderly conduct and reckless driving, and was fined $100.

In 2009, Coleman and his ex-wife were involved in a [[domestic dispute]], after which Price was arrested on suspicion of [[domestic violence]], and both parties were cited for disorderly conduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldextra.com/news/local/south/santaquin/article_109c00b4-d9a1-51c9-ada6-24ab51debaf2.html |title=Gary Coleman's wife arrested for domestic violence|work=Daily Herald|date= August 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2010, months before his death, Coleman was arrested on an outstanding domestic assault warrant in Santaquin, booked into the Utah County Jail,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ksl.com/index.php?nid=148&amp;sid=9454836 |title=Actor Gary Coleman arrested for 2nd time in Utah County |website=Ksl.com |date=January 24, 2010 |accessdate=May 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and released the following day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Stein |first=Jeannine |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/wire/sns-ap-us-gary-coleman-jailed,0,6143633.story |title=Actor Gary Coleman released from Utah jail after arrest on outstanding warrant |work=Los Angeles Times |date= |accessdate=May 28, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615050808/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/wire/sns-ap-us-gary-coleman-jailed%2C0%2C6143633.story |archivedate=June 15, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Trains and model railroading ==
Coleman was an avid [[railfan]], model railroader, and supporter of [[Amtrak]]. He became interested in trains sometime before the age of 5 during his frequent train trips to [[Chicago]], in support of his burgeoning acting career.&lt;ref name="sitcomsonline.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sitcomsonline.com/garycolemanchat.txt |website=sitcomsonline.com| title=Interview Transcript | date = |accessdate=May 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fans often saw him at stores specializing in model trains in areas in which he lived, and he worked part-time at Denver-area, Tucson-area, and California hobby stores to be around his hobby.&lt;ref name="sitcomsonline.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forum.atlasrr.com/forum/topic.asp?ARCHIVE=true&amp;TOPIC_ID=60443 | title=Atlas Model Railroad Forum: Gary Coleman | date = |accessdate=May 6, 2013|website=atlassrr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coleman built and maintained miniature railroads in his homes in several states. One of his train layouts appears in the September 1990 issue of ''Railroad Model Craftsman''. Coleman is photographed on the front cover, with his "Rio Grande" layout.

He preferred to model in [[HO scale]], but modeled in other scales, as well. One such model railroad was over 800 square feet (75 m²) in size. Currently, at least one of Coleman's model railroads is being preserved in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]], [[Colorado]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koaa.com/news/gary-colemans-model-trains-stored-in-colorado/#_|title=Gary Coleman's model trains stored in Colorado|website=koaa.com|accessdate=May 6, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130607181828/http://www.koaa.com/news/gary-colemans-model-trains-stored-in-colorado/#_|archivedate=June 7, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death and memorial ==
Very few details of Coleman's medical history have been made public. His short stature (4 feet, 8&amp;nbsp;inches or 142 centimeters) stemmed from congenital kidney disease and its treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New Details in Gary Coleman's Death |url=http://www.abcactionnews.com/dpp/entertainment/new-details-in-gary-coleman's-death-revealed-in-911-call |website=abcactionnews.com |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=July 11, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100606183204/http://www.abcactionnews.com/dpp/entertainment/new-details-in-gary-coleman%27s-death-revealed-in-911-call |archivedate=June 6, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He underwent at least two unsuccessful kidney transplants early in his life and required frequent dialysis, which he preferred not to discuss. In 2009, Coleman underwent [[heart surgery]], details of which were never made public, but he is known to have developed pneumonia postoperatively.&lt;ref name="Tel ill"/&gt; In January 2010, Coleman was hospitalized after a [[seizure]] in [[Los Angeles]], and in February he suffered another seizure on the set of ''[[The Insider (TV series)|The Insider]]'' television program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Gary Coleman Hospitalized Again |date= February 26, 2010 |url= http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/gossip/2010/02/gary-coleman-the-insider-seizure-dr-drew-pinsky.html |work= LATimes |accessdate= July 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The casts of the Off Broadway production of ''[[Avenue Q]]'' in New York City and the ''Avenue Q'' National Tour in Dallas dedicated their May 28 performances to his memory, and the actors playing the part of Coleman paid tribute to him from the stage at the performances' conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Propst|first=Andy|title=Gary Coleman, Star of Diff'rent Strokes and Character in Avenue Q, Dies at 42.|url=http://www.theatermania.com/off-broadway/news/05-2010/gary-coleman-star-of-diffrent-strokes-and-a-charac_27775.html|accessdate=May 29, 2010|newspaper=Theater Mania|date=May 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Silverman |first=Stephen M. |url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20389492,00.html |title=Diff'rent Strokes Star Gary Coleman Dies at 42 |work=People |date=May 28, 2010 |accessdate=June 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The Coleman character remained in the show after modifications were made to relevant dialogue.&lt;ref name="Itzkoff"&gt;{{cite news|author=Itzkoff, Dave |date=May 29, 2010|title='Avenue Q' Deals With Death of Gary Coleman |url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/29/avenue-q-deals-with-death-of-gary-coleman/ |work=The New York Times|accessdate= June 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

The weekend after Coleman's death, a scheduled funeral was postponed and later canceled due to a dispute regarding the disposition of his estate and remains among Coleman's adoptive parents, former business associate Anna Gray, and Price. Coleman's former manager, Dion Mial, was involved initially, but withdrew after Coleman's 1999 will, which named Mial as [[executor]] and directed that his wake be "...conducted by those with no financial ties to me and can look each other in the eyes and say they really cared personally for Gary Colemen {{sic}}",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tmz.vo.llnwd.net/o28/newsdesk/tmz_documents/0608_gary_coleman_will_doc.pdf |title=Gary Coleman's 1999 Last Will|work=TMZ| accessdate= March 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; turned out to be superseded by a later one replacing Mial with Gray,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Coleman's Former Friend to Bow Out of Estate Fight |date=June 15, 2010|url=http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/home/49759902-73/coleman-estate-price-court.html.csp |work=Salt Lake City Tribune|accessdate= July 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and directing "...that there be no funeral service, wake, or other ceremony memorializing my passing."&lt;ref name = "ashes"&gt;{{cite news|title=Coleman's Ashes Kept Locked Up During Battle of Wills |date=June 16, 2010|url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/SHOWBIZ/celebrity.news.gossip/06/16/gary.coleman.ashes/index.html |work=CNN|accessdate= July 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lee |first=Ken |url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20392290,00.html |title=Gary Coleman Leaves Bittersweet Instructions for Funeral |website=People.com |date= |accessdate=August 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Questions were also raised as to whether Price, who approved discontinuing Coleman's life support, was legally authorized to do so. The controversy was exacerbated by a photograph published on the front page of the tabloid newspaper ''[[Globe (tabloid)|The Globe]]'' depicting Price posed next to a comatose, intubated Coleman, under the headline, "It Was Murder!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Thomas |first=Devon |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-31749_162-20007255-10391698.html |work=CBS|title='' Globe Magazine'' Publishes Gary Coleman Deathbed Photo; June&amp;nbsp;9, 2010 3:17&amp;nbsp;Pm |publisher=Cbsnews.com |date=June 9, 2010 |accessdate=August 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hospital later issued a statement confirming that Coleman had completed an [[advance health care directive]] granting Price permission to make medical decisions on his behalf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hospital: Gary Coleman's Ex-Wife Was Authorized to Pull the Plug |date=June 3, 2010|url=http://www.usmagazine.com/celebritynews/news/hospital-gary-colemans-ex-wife-was-authorized-to-pull-the-plug-201036 |work=US Magazine|accessdate= July 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; An investigation by Santaquin police was closed on October 5, 2010, after the medical examiner ruled Coleman's death accidental, and no evidence of wrongdoing could be demonstrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radaronline.com/exclusives/2010/06/new-details-police-investigation-gary-colemans-death-still-open-foul-play-not |website=radaronline.com|date= July 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cops Close Coleman Death Case. |url=http://www.torontosun.com/entertainment/celebrities/2010/10/05/15593026-wenn-story.html |work=Toronto Sun|accessdate= 2010-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Coleman's final will, signed in 2005, named Gray as executor and awarded his entire estate to her, Coleman and Price married in 2007.  Although they divorced in 2008, Price claimed in a court petition that she remained Coleman's common-law wife, sharing bank accounts  and the couple presented themselves publicly as husband and wife until Coleman's death, an assertion that, if validated by the court, would make her the lawful heir.&lt;ref name = "ashes"/&gt;

In May 2012, Judge James Taylor ruled that while Price had indeed lived in Coleman's home after their marriage ended, their relationship at the time of his death failed to meet Utah's standard for a common-law marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Judge: Shannon Price is not Gary Coleman’s common-law wife |date=May 14, 2012|url=http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/news/54111101-78/coleman-price-wife-common.html.csp |work=The Salt Lake Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; The disposition of his ashes remains unreported.  Price said, were she granted disposition, she would scatter the ashes at the [[Golden Spike National Historic Site]] in Utah as a tribute to Coleman's lifelong love of trains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Gary Coleman's Ashes Remain at Attorney's Office, Ex-Wife Claims |date= March 10, 2011 |url= http://www.radaronline.com/exclusives/2011/03/exclusive-gary-colemans-ashes-remain-attorneys-office-ex-wife-claims |work= Radaronline.com |accessdate= December 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
