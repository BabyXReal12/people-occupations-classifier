'''Leslie Townes Hope''', [[Order of the British Empire|KBE]], [[Order of St. Gregory the Great|KC*SG]], [[Order of St. Sylvester|KSS]] (May 29, 1903 – July 27, 2003) known professionally as '''Bob  Hope''', was an &lt;!-- per WP:OPENPARA please do NOT put "English-born" or "British-born" here. His place of birth is noted quite clearly in the infobox and elsewhere in the lead. Thanks --&gt;English-American stand-up comedian,&lt;ref name="PBS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/bob-hope-biography/9725/|title=This Is Bob Hope… Biography|author=Zoglin, Richard|date=November 30, 2017|publisher=[[PBS]]|accessdate=May 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[vaudevillian]], actor, singer, dancer, athlete, and author.&lt;!-- Don't change occupations. --&gt; With a career that spanned nearly 80 years, Hope appeared in [[Bob Hope filmography|more than 70 short and feature films,]] with 54 feature films with Hope as star, including a series of seven "[[Road to ...|Road]]" musical comedy movies with [[Bing Crosby]] as Hope's top-billed partner. In addition to hosting the [[Academy Awards]] show 19 times, [[List of Academy Awards ceremonies#Multiple ceremonies hosted|more than any other host]], he appeared in many stage productions and television roles, and was the author of 14 books. The song "[[Thanks for the Memory]]" was his signature tune.

Hope was born in the [[Eltham, London|Eltham]] district of southeast [[London]], UK, arrived in the United States with his family at the age of four, and grew up in the [[Cleveland, Ohio]] area. After a brief career as a [[boxer]] in the late 1910s, he began his career in [[show business]] in the early 1920s, initially as a [[comedian]] and [[dancer]] on the [[vaudeville|vaudeville circuit]], before acting on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. Hope began appearing on radio and in films starting in 1934. He was praised for his comedic timing, specializing in [[one-liner joke|one-liners]] and rapid-fire delivery of jokes which often were [[self-deprecating humor|self-deprecating]]. He is often credited with having helped create the modern American version of [[stand-up comedy]].&lt;ref name="PBS" /&gt; Celebrated for his long career performing in [[United Service Organizations]] (USO) shows to entertain active duty American military personnel, making 57 tours for the USO between 1941 and 1991, Hope was declared an honorary veteran of the [[United States Armed Forces|U.S. Armed Forces]] in 1997 by an act of the [[United States Congress]].&lt;ref name="Library of Congress" /&gt; He also appeared in numerous specials for [[NBC]] television starting in 1950, and was one of the first users of [[cue card]]s. Hope participated in the sports of golf and boxing and owned a small stake in his hometown baseball team, the [[Cleveland Indians]]. Hope retired in 1997, and died at the [[Centenarian|age of 100]] in 2003, at his home in the [[Toluca Lake]] neighborhood of [[Los Angeles]].

== Early years ==
[[File:HopewithGroupMeetsPattonWW2.jpg|thumb|left|Writer [[Hal Block]] (far left) and Hope (second from left) meet [[George Patton]] in Sicily during World War II]]
Hope, the fifth of seven sons, was born in [[Eltham]], [[County of London]]&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; (now part of the [[Royal Borough of Greenwich]]), in a terraced house on Craigton Road in [[Well Hall]]&lt;ref name=BobBirthPlace&gt;{{cite web|title=Bob Hope birthplace for sale|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/99571.stm|website=news.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=10 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BobBirthPlace2&gt;{{cite web|title=Bob Hope - from Eltham to Hollywood|url=http://www.newsshopper.co.uk/news/nostalgia/10541810.Bob_Hope___from_Eltham_to_Hollywood/|website=www.newsshopper.co.uk|accessdate=10 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; where there is now a blue plaque in his memory.&lt;ref name=BobBirthPlace3&gt;{{cite web|title=Plaque: Bob Hope|url=http://www.londonremembers.com/memorials/bob-hope|website=www.londonremembers.com|accessdate=10 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[English people|English]] father, William Henry Hope, was a [[stonemason]] from [[Weston-super-Mare|Weston-super-Mare, Somerset]], and his [[Welsh people|Welsh]] mother, Avis (née Townes), was a [[operetta|light opera]] singer from [[Barry, Vale of Glamorgan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://barryideasbank.crowdicity.com/post/7891 |title=Barry Ideas Bank |publisher=[[Crowdicity]] |accessdate=February 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; who later worked as a cleaner. William and Avis married in April 1891 and lived at 12 Greenwood Street in Barry before moving to [[Whitehall, Bristol]], and then to [[St George, Bristol]]. In 1908, the family emigrated to the United States, sailing aboard the [[SS Philadelphia (1888)|SS ''Philadelphia'']]. They passed through [[Ellis Island|Ellis Island, New York]] on March 30, 1908, before moving on to [[Cleveland, Ohio]].{{sfn|Moreno|2008|p=88}}

From age 12, Hope earned pocket money by [[busking]]—public performing to solicit contributions (frequently on the streetcar to [[Luna Park, Cleveland|Luna Park]]), singing, dancing, and performing comedy.{{sfn|Grudens|2002|p=4}} He entered numerous dancing and amateur talent contests as Lester Hope, and won a prize in 1915 for his impersonation of [[Charlie Chaplin]].&lt;ref name="loc.gov Early Life"/&gt; For a time, he attended the Boys' Industrial School in [[Lancaster, Ohio]], and as an adult donated sizable sums of money to the institution.&lt;ref name="ohiohistorycentral"/&gt; Hope had a brief career as a [[pugilist|boxer]] in 1919, fighting under the name Packy East. He had three wins and one loss, and he participated in a few staged charity bouts later in life.&lt;ref name="Boxing-Scoop.com"/&gt;

Hope worked as a butcher's assistant and a [[lineman (technician)|lineman]] in his teens and early 20s. He also had a brief stint at [[Chandler Motor Car|Chandler Motor Car Company]]. In 1921, while assisting his brother Jim in clearing trees for a power company, he was sitting atop a tree that crashed to the ground, crushing his face; the accident required Hope to undergo reconstructive surgery, which contributed to his later bizarrely distinctive appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/features/the-road-not-taken-19800320|title=Bob Hope Reflects on the Road Not Taken|journal=Rolling Stone|last=White|first=Timothy|date=March 20, 1980|accessdate=January 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deciding on a show business career, Hope and his girlfriend at the time signed up for dancing lessons. Encouraged after they performed in a three-day engagement at a club, Hope formed a partnership with [[Lloyd Durbin]], a friend from the dancing school.{{sfn|Quirk|1998|pp=19–23}} Silent film comedian [[Roscoe Arbuckle|Fatty Arbuckle]] saw them perform in 1925 and found them work with a touring troupe called Hurley's Jolly Follies. Within a year, Hope had formed an act called the Dancemedians with George Byrne and the [[Hilton twins|Hilton Sisters]], conjoined twins who performed a tap dancing routine in the [[vaudeville]] circuit. Hope and Byrne had an act as Siamese twins as well, and danced and sang while wearing [[blackface]] until friends advised Hope he was funnier as himself.{{sfn|Faith|2003|pp=402–403}}

In 1929, Hope informally changed his first name to "Bob." In one version of the story, he named himself after race car driver [[Bob Burman]].{{sfn|Quirk|1998|p=44}} In another, he said he chose the name because he wanted a name with a "friendly 'Hiya, fellas!' sound" to it.{{sfn|Grudens|2002|pp=15–16}} In a 1942 legal document, his legal name is given as Lester Townes Hope; it is unknown if this reflects a legal name change from Leslie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/bobhope/uso.html|title=Bob Hope and American Variety: On the Road: USO Shows|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]|accessdate=January 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After five years on the vaudeville circuit, Hope was "surprised and humbled" when he failed a 1930 screen test for the French film production company [[Pathé]] at [[Culver City, California]].{{sfn|Quirk|1998|pp=57–58}}

== Career ==
In the early days, Hope's career included appearances on stage in vaudeville shows and Broadway productions. He began performing on the radio in 1934, and switched to television when that medium became popular in the 1950s. He began doing regular TV specials in 1954,{{sfn|Quirk|1998|p=229}} and hosted the [[Academy Awards]] nineteen times from 1939 through 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.biography.com/news/bob-hope-king-of-the-oscars-21156325 | title=Bob Hope: King of the Oscars | website=Biography | accessdate=July 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Overlapping with this was his movie career, spanning 1934 to 1972, and his USO tours, which he conducted from 1941 to 1991.{{sfn|Quirk|1998|pp=318–320}}{{sfn|Grudens|2002|pp=181–182}}

=== Film ===
{{main article|Bob Hope filmography|Bob Hope short subjects}}

Hope signed a contract with [[Educational Pictures]] of New York for six short films. The first was a comedy, ''[[Going Spanish]]'' (1934). He was not happy with it, and told  newspaper gossip columnist [[Walter Winchell]], "When they catch [bank robber]  [[John Dillinger|Dillinger]], they're going to make him sit through it twice."{{sfn|Maltin|1972|p=25}} Although Educational Pictures dropped his contract, he soon signed with [[Warner Brothers]], making movies during the day and performing in Broadway shows in the evenings.{{sfn|Quirk|1998|pp=105, 107}}

[[File:Bob Hope in The Ghost Breakers trailer.JPG|thumb|left|Bob Hope in ''[[The Ghost Breakers]]'' trailer (1940)]]

Hope moved to Hollywood when [[Paramount Pictures]] signed him for the 1938 film ''[[The Big Broadcast of 1938]]'', also starring [[W. C. Fields]]. The song "[[Thanks for the Memory]]", which later became his trademark, was introduced in the film as a duet with [[Shirley Ross]], accompanied by [[Shep Fields]] and his orchestra.{{sfn|Quirk|1998|pp=110, 113}} The sentimental, fluid nature of the music allowed Hope's writers—he depended heavily upon joke writers throughout his career{{sfn|Lahr|1998}}—to later create variations of the song to fit specific circumstances, such as bidding farewell to troops while on tour or mentioning the names of towns in which he was performing.{{sfn|Grudens|2002|p=133}}

[[File:Bob Hope, Bing Crosby and Dorothy Lamour in Road to Bali.jpg|thumb|Bob Hope, [[Bing Crosby]] and [[Dorothy Lamour]] in ''[[Road to Bali]]'' (1952)]]

As a movie star, Hope was best known for such comedies as ''[[My Favorite Brunette]]'' and the highly successful "[[Road to …|Road]]" movies in which he starred with [[Bing Crosby]] and [[Dorothy Lamour]]. The series consists of seven films made between 1940 and 1962 -- ''[[Road to Singapore]]'' (1940), ''[[Road to Zanzibar]]'' (1941), ''[[Road to Morocco]]'' (1942), ''[[Road to Utopia]]'' (1946), ''[[Road to Rio]]'' (1947), ''[[Road to Bali]]'' (1952), and ''[[The Road to Hong Kong]]'' (1962). Hope had seen Lamour performing as a nightclub singer in New York,{{sfn|Quirk|1998|p=112}} and invited her to work on his [[United Service Organizations]] (USO) tours of military facilities. Lamour sometimes arrived for filming prepared with her lines, only to be baffled by completely rewritten scripts or ad lib dialogue between Hope and Crosby.{{sfn|Quirk|1998|p=128}} Hope and Lamour were lifelong friends, and she remains the actress most associated with his film career although he made movies with dozens of [[leading lady|leading ladies]], including such luminaries as [[Katharine Hepburn]], [[Paulette Goddard]], [[Hedy Lamarr]], [[Lucille Ball]], [[Rosemary Clooney]], [[Jane Russell]], and [[Elke Sommer]].{{sfn|Grudens|2002|pp=174–180}}

From their first meeting in 1932, Hope and Crosby teamed not only for the "Road" pictures, but for countless stage, radio, and television appearances and many brief movie appearances together over the decades {{sfn|Quirk|1998|p=127}} until Crosby's death in 1977. Although the two invested together in oil leases and other business ventures, worked together frequently, and lived near each other, they rarely saw each other socially.{{sfn|Quirk|1998|pp=127, 137}}
[[File:Bob Hope and Bing Crosby in Road to Bali.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Bob Hope and Bing Crosby sing and dance during "Chicago Style" in ''[[Road to Bali]]'' (1952)]]
After the release of ''Road to Singapore'' (1940), Hope's screen career took off, and he had a long and successful run. After an 11-year hiatus from the "Road" genre, he and Crosby reteamed for ''The Road to Hong Kong'' (1962), starring the 28-year-old [[Joan Collins]] in place of Lamour, whom Crosby thought was too old for the part.{{sfn|Quirk|1998|p=265}} They had planned one more movie together in 1977, ''The Road to the Fountain of Youth'', but filming was postponed when Crosby was injured in a fall, and the production was cancelled when he suddenly died of heart failure that October.{{sfn|Quirk|1998|p=287}}

Hope starred in 54 theatrical features between 1938 and 1972,{{sfn|Grudens|2002|p=41}} as well as cameos and short films. Most of his later movies failed to match the stratospheric success of his 1940s efforts. He was disappointed with his appearance in ''[[Cancel My Reservation]]'' (1972), his last starring film, and the movie was poorly received by critics and filmgoers.{{sfn|Quirk|1998|pp=285–286}}  Though his career as a film star effectively ended in 1972, he did make a few cameo film appearances into the 1980s.

Hope was [[Master of Ceremonies|host]] of the Academy Awards ceremony 19 times between 1939 and 1977. His supposedly-feigned desire for an Oscar became part of his act.{{sfn|Grudens|2002|p=154}} While introducing the 1968 telecast, he quipped, "Welcome to the Academy Awards, or, as it's known at my house, [[Passover]]."{{sfn|McCaffrey|2005|p=56}} Although he was never nominated for an Oscar, the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] honored him with four honorary awards, and in 1960 presented him with the [[Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award]], given each year as part of the Oscars ceremony.

=== Broadcasting ===

Hope's career in broadcasting began on radio in 1934. His first regular series for [[NBC Radio]] was the ''Woodbury Soap Hour'' in 1937, on a 26-week contract. A year later, ''[[The Pepsodent Show Starring Bob Hope]]'' began, and Hope signed a ten-year contract with the show's sponsor, [[Lever Brothers]]. He hired eight writers and paid them out of his salary of $2,500 a week. The original staff included [[Mel Shavelson]], [[Norman Panama]], [[Jack Rose (screenwriter)|Jack Rose]], [[Sherwood Schwartz]], and Schwartz's brother [[Al Schwartz (writer)|Al]]. The writing staff eventually grew to fifteen.{{sfn|Nachman|1998|p=144}} The show became the top radio program in the country. Regulars on the series included [[Jerry Colonna (entertainer)|Jerry Colonna]] and [[Barbara Jo Allen]] as spinster Vera Vague. Hope continued his lucrative career in radio through to the 1950s, when radio's popularity began being overshadowed by the upstart television medium.{{sfn|Grudens|2002|pp=30–32}}{{sfn|Quirk|1998|pp=92–103}}

=== NBC comedy specials ===

[[File:Jack Hope Jack Benny Bob Hope 1954.JPG|thumb|upright|left|Hope (right) with his brother [[Jack Hope|Jack]] (seated), who produced his early 1950s show, with comedian [[Jack Benny]]]]

Hope did many specials for the NBC television network in the following decades, beginning in April 1950. He was one of the first people to use [[cue card]]s. The shows often were sponsored by [[Frigidaire]] (early 1950s), [[General Motors]] (1955–61), [[Chrysler]] (1963–73), and [[Texaco]] (1975–85).{{sfn|Grudens|2002|pp=47–48}} Hope's Christmas specials were popular favorites and often featured a performance of "[[Silver Bells]]"—from his 1951 film ''[[The Lemon Drop Kid]]''—done as a duet with an often much younger female guest star such as [[Olivia Newton-John]], [[Barbara Eden]], and [[Brooke Shields]],{{sfn|Grudens|2002|p=160}} or with his wife Dolores, a former singer with whom he dueted on two specials. Hope's 1970 and 1971 Christmas specials for NBC—filmed in [[Vietnam]] in front of military audiences at the height of the war—are on the list of the [[List of most watched television broadcasts#Top 46 network prime-time telecasts|Top 46 U.S. network prime-time telecasts]]. Both were seen by more than 60 percent of the U.S. households watching television.{{sfn|Grudens|2002|p=48}}

=== ''[[The Adventures of Bob Hope]]'' ===
{{Main|The Adventures of Bob Hope}}
Beginning in early 1950, Hope licensed rights to publish a [[celebrity comics|celebrity]] [[comic book]] titled ''The Adventures of Bob Hope'' to National Periodical Publications, alias [[DC Comics]]. The comic, originally featuring publicity stills of Hope on the cover, was entirely made up of fictional stories, eventually including fictitious relatives, a [[high school]] taught by movie monsters, and a superhero called [[Super-Hip]]. It was published intermittently, and continued publication through issue #109 in 1969. Illustrators included [[Bob Oksner]] and (for the last four issues) [[Neal Adams]].{{source?|date=March 2018}}

=== USO Involvement ===
{{see also|United Service Organizations#Honoring Bob Hope|label 1=USO&amp;nbsp;– Honoring Bob Hope}}
[[File:Hope WWII 44.jpg|left|thumb|Hope entertains soldiers during World War II]]
While aboard the [[RMS Queen Mary|RMS ''Queen Mary'']] when World War II began in September 1939, Hope volunteered to perform a special show for the passengers, during which he sang "Thanks for the Memory" with rewritten lyrics.{{sfn|Friedrich|1986|p=26}} He performed his first USO show on May 6, 1941, at [[March Air Reserve Base|March Field]] in California,{{sfn|Grudens|2002|p=113}} and continued to travel and entertain troops for the rest of World War II, later during the [[Korean War]], the Vietnam War, the third phase of the [[Lebanon Civil War]], the latter years of the [[Iran–Iraq War]], and the 1990–91 [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]].{{sfn|Grudens|2002|pp=181–182}} His USO career lasted a half-century during which he headlined 57 times.{{sfn|Grudens|2002|pp=181–182}}

He had a deep respect for the men and women who served in the military, and this was reflected in his willingness to go anywhere to entertain them.&lt;ref name="King" /&gt; However, during the highly controversial [[Vietnam War]], Hope had trouble convincing some performers to join him on tour. [[Opposition to the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War|Anti-war sentiment]] was high, and his pro-troop stance made him a target of criticism from some quarters. Some shows were drowned out by boos, others were listened to in silence.{{sfn|Grudens|2002|pp=251, 254, 258}}

The tours were funded by the U.S. Department of Defense, Hope's television sponsors, and by [[NBC]], the network that  broadcast the television specials created after each tour from footage shot on location. However, the footage and shows were owned by Hope's own production company, which made them very lucrative ventures for him, as outlined by writer Richard Zoglin in his 2014 biography "[http://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Hope/Richard-Zoglin/9781439140284 Hope: Entertainer of the Century.]"

[[File:Bob hope lackland afb.jpg|thumb|upright|Hope at [[Lackland Air Force Base]] in Texas in 1990]]

Hope sometimes recruited his own family members for USO travel. His wife, Dolores, sang from atop an armored vehicle during the Desert Storm tour, and granddaughter Miranda appeared alongside him on an aircraft carrier in the [[Indian Ocean]].&lt;ref name="King"/&gt; Of Hope's USO shows in World War II, novelist [[John Steinbeck]], who then was working as a war correspondent, wrote in 1943:

{{quote|sign=|source=|"When the time for recognition of service to the nation in wartime comes to be considered, Bob Hope should be high on the list. This man drives himself and is driven. It is impossible to see how he can do so much, can cover so much ground, can work so hard, and can be so effective.

For his service to his country through the USO, he was awarded the [[Sylvanus Thayer Award]] by the [[United States Military Academy]] at West Point in 1968.&lt;ref name="Thayer award"/&gt; A 1997 act of [[United States Congress|Congress]] signed by President [[Bill Clinton]] named Hope an "Honorary Veteran." He remarked, "I've been given many awards in my lifetime, but to be numbered among the men and women I admire most is the greatest honor I have ever received."{{sfn|Faith|2003|p=429}} In an homage to Hope, comedian/TV host [[Stephen Colbert]] carried a golf club on stage during the single week of USO performances he taped for his TV show, ''[[The Colbert Report]]'', during the 2009 season.&lt;ref name="LA Times June 2009"/&gt;

=== Theater ===
Hope's first Broadway appearances, in 1927's ''The Sidewalks of New York'' and 1928's ''Ups-a-Daisy'', were minor walk-on parts.{{sfn|Faith|2003|p=403}}  He returned to Broadway in 1933 to star as Huckleberry Haines in the [[Jerome Kern]] / [[Dorothy Fields]] musical ''[[Roberta]]''.{{sfn|Quirk|1998|p=71}} Stints in the musicals ''[[Say When (musical)|Say When]]'', the 1936 [[Ziegfeld Follies]] with [[Fanny Brice]], and ''[[Red, Hot and Blue]]'' with [[Ethel Merman]] and [[Jimmy Durante]] followed.{{sfn|Quirk|1998|pp=73–75}} Hope reprised his role as Huck Haines in a 1958 production of ''Roberta'' at [[The Muny]] Theater in [[Forest Park (St. Louis, Missouri)|Forest Park in]]  [[St. Louis, Missouri]].&lt;ref name="The Muny 1958"/&gt;

Additionally, Hope rescued the [[The Bob Hope Theatre|Eltham Little Theatre]] in [[England]] from closure by providing funds to buy the property. He continued his interest and support, and regularly visited the facility when in London. In 1982, the theater was renamed in his honor.&lt;ref name="bobhopetheatre 100th"/&gt;

===Later appearances===
In 1992, Hope made a guest appearance as himself on  the animated Fox series ''[[The Simpsons]]'', in the episode titled  "[[Lisa the Beauty Queen]]" (season 4, episode 4).&lt;ref name="Simpsons Season 4"/&gt; His 90th birthday television celebration in May 1993, ''Bob Hope: The First 90 Years'', won an [[Emmy Award]] for Outstanding Variety, Music Or Comedy Special.&lt;ref name="Emmys 1993"/&gt; Toward the end of his career, worsening vision problems rendered him unable to read his cue cards.{{sfn|Quirk|1998|p=291}} In October 1996, he announced he was ending his 60-year contract with NBC, joking that he "decided to become a free agent."&lt;ref name="Errico 1996"/&gt; His final television special, ''Laughing with the Presidents'', was broadcast in November 1996, with host [[Tony Danza]] helping him present a personal retrospective of [[President of the United States|presidents of the United States]] known to Hope, a frequent White House visitor over the years. However, the special received poor reviews.&lt;ref name="Seely 2005"/&gt; Following a brief appearance at the 50th Primetime Emmy Awards in 1997, Hope made his last TV appearance in a 1997 commercial about the introduction of [[Big Kmart]], and directed by [[Penny Marshall]].&lt;ref name="K-Mart press release 1997"/&gt;

== Critical reception ==
[[File:Jerry colonna bob hope 1940 nbc.JPG|left|thumb|Hope with comic sidekick [[Jerry Colonna (entertainer)|Jerry Colonna]] and his trademark handlebar mustache in 1940]]
Hope was widely praised for his comedy timing and his specialization in the use of  [[one-liner joke|one-liner]]s and rapid-fire delivery of jokes. He was known for his style of self-deprecating jokes, first building himself up then tearing himself down. He performed hundreds of times per year.{{sfn|Quirk|1998|p=158}}  Such early films as ''[[The Cat and the Canary (1939 film)|The Cat and the Canary]]'' (1939) and ''[[The Paleface (1948 film)|The Paleface]]'' (1948) were financially successful and praised by critics,{{sfn|Quirk|1998|pp=123, 183}} and by the mid-1940s, with his radio program getting good ratings as well, he was one of the most popular entertainers in the United States.{{sfn|Quirk|1998|p=153}} When Paramount threatened to stop production of the "Road" pictures in 1945, they received 75,000 letters of protest.{{sfn|Quirk|1998|p=172}}

Hope had no faith in his skills as a dramatic actor, and his performances of that type were not as well received.{{sfn|Quirk|1998|pp=184, 187}} He had been well known in radio until the late 1940s, but as his ratings began to slip in the 1950s, he switched to television and became an early pioneer of that medium.{{sfn|Grudens|2002|p=160}}{{sfn|Quirk|1998|p=173}}. He published several books notably dictating to [[ghostwriter]]s about his wartime experiences.{{sfn|Quirk|1998|p=153}}

Although Hope made an effort to keep his material up to date, he never adapted his comic persona or his routines to any great degree. As Hollywood began to transition to the "[[New Hollywood]]" era in the 1960s, he reacted negatively, such as when he hosted the [[40th Academy Awards]] in 1968 and voiced his contempt by mocking the show's delay because of the assassination of [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] and condescendingly greeted attending younger actors on stage—such as [[Dustin Hoffman]], who was 30 at the time—as children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harris|first1=Mark|title=Pictures at a Revolution|date=2008|publisher=Penguin Press|page=409}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1970s, his popularity was beginning to wane with military personnel and with the movie-going public in general.{{sfn|Quirk|1998|pp=255, 276, 314}} However, he continued doing USO tours into the 1980s,{{sfn|Grudens|2002|p=161}} and continued to appear on television into the 1990s. Former First Lady [[Nancy Reagan]], a close friend and frequent host to him at the White House, called Hope  "America's most honored citizen and our favorite clown."{{sfn|Quirk|1998|p=312}}

[[File:Bob Hope playing golf in the Oval Office.gif|thumb|upright|left|Bob Hope, a golf fan, putting a golf ball into an ashtray held by President [[Richard Nixon]] in the [[Oval Office]] in 1973]]

Hope was well known as an avid golfer, playing in as many as 150 charity tournaments a year.{{sfn|Grudens|2002|p=57}} Introduced to the game in the 1930s while performing in [[Winnipeg]], Canada,&lt;ref name="Manitoba Historic Society 1988"/&gt; he eventually played to a four [[Golf handicap|handicap]]. His love for the game—and the humor he could find in it—made him a sought-after [[foursome (golf)|foursome]] member. He once remarked that President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] gave up golf for painting&amp;nbsp;-- "Fewer strokes, you know."&lt;ref name="panews May 1980"/&gt; He also was quoted as saying, "It's wonderful how you can start out with three strangers in the morning, play 18 holes, and by the time the day is over you have three solid enemies." &lt;ref name="Golf Hall of Fame" /&gt;

A golf club became an integral [[Theatrical property|prop]] for Hope during the standup segments of his television specials and USO shows. In 1978, he putted against the then-two-year-old [[Tiger Woods]] in a television appearance with the actor [[James Stewart|Jimmy Stewart]] on ''[[The Mike Douglas Show]]''.&lt;ref name="Fox Sports 2012"/&gt;

The [[Bob Hope Classic]], founded in 1960, made history in 1995 when Hope teed up for the opening round in a foursome that included Presidents [[Gerald Ford]], [[George H.W. Bush]], and [[Bill Clinton]], the only time three U.S. presidents played in the same golf foursome.&lt;ref name="bhcc History"/&gt;  The event, now known as the CareerBuilder Challenge, was one of the few [[PGA Tour]] tournaments that took place over five rounds, until the 2012 tournament when it was cut back to the conventional four.&lt;ref name="Business Wire"/&gt;

Hope had a heavy interest in sports beyond golf and his brief fling as a professional boxer in his youth. In 1946, he bought a small stake in the [[Cleveland Indians]] professional baseball team&lt;ref name="Windsor Star 1946"/&gt; and held it for most of the rest of his life.&lt;ref name="Rea 1982"/&gt; He appeared on the June 3, 1963, cover of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' magazine wearing an Indians uniform,&lt;ref name="Sports Illustrated cover"/&gt; and sang a special version of "Thanks for the Memory" after the Indians' last game at [[Cleveland Stadium]] on October 3, 1993.&lt;ref name="Dawidziak 2003"/&gt; He also bought a share with Bing Crosby of the [[Los Angeles Rams]] football team in 1947, but sold it in 1962.&lt;ref name="Lodi News 1962"/&gt; He frequently used his television specials to promote the annual AP [[College Football All-America Team]]. The players would come onstage one-by-one and introduce themselves, then Hope, often dressed in a football uniform, would give a one-liner about the player or his school.&lt;ref name="FWAA 2009"/&gt;

== Personal life ==

=== Marriages ===
[[File:Bob Hope and family.jpg|thumb|The Hope family. Back, from left: Tony, Dolores, and Linda. Front, from left: Kelly, Hope, and Nora.]]

Hope's short-lived first marriage was to vaudeville partner Grace Louise Troxell (1912-1992), a secretary from Chicago, Illinois, who was the daughter of Edward and Mary (McGinnes) Troxell. They were married on January 25, 1933, in Erie, Pennsylvania, with [[Alderman]] Eugene Alberstadt officiating.&lt;ref&gt;"Pennsylvania, County Marriages, 1885-1950," database with images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:VFQR-NPT), William H Hope in entry for Leslie T Hope and Grace L Troxell, January 25, 1933; citing Marriage, Pennsylvania, county courthouses, Pennsylvania; FHL microfilm 2,259,873.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Quirk|1998|p=66}} They divorced in November 1934.&lt;ref name="Sheridan 2014"&gt;{{cite news | last = Sheridan | first = Peter | url = http://www.express.co.uk/news/showbiz/499930/Bob-Hope-the-bigamist | title = Bob Hope the Bigamist | work = [[Daily Express]] | date =August 16, 2014 | accessdate = August 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The couple had shared headliner status with Joe Howard at the Palace Theatre in April 1931, performing "Keep Smiling" and the "Antics of 1931."&lt;ref&gt;The Scranton Republican, Scranton, Pennsylvania, Monday, April 27, 1931, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; The couple was working together at the RKO Albee, performing the "Antics of 1933" along with Ann Gillens and Johnny Peters in June of that year.&lt;ref&gt;The Brooklyn Daily Eagle, Brooklyn, New York, Wednesday, June 28, 1933, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; The following month, singer Dolores Reade joined Hope's vaudeville troupe and was performing with him at Loew's Metropolitan Theater. She was described as a "former Zeigfeld beauty and one of society's favorite nightclub entertainers, having appeared at many private social functions at New York, Palm Beach, and Southampton."&lt;ref&gt;Eagle Brooklyn, New York, Saturday, July 14, 1933, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Their long marriage was fraught with ambiguities. As [[Richard Zoglin]] wrote in his 2014 biography ''Hope: Entertainer of the Century'', "Bob and Dolores always claimed that they married in February 1934 in Erie, Pennsylvania. But at that time he was secretly married to his vaudeville partner Louise Troxell, after three years together on and off. I found divorce papers for Bob and Louise dated November 1934, so either Bob Hope was a bigamist or he lied about marrying Dolores in February that year. He had actually married Louise in January 1933 in Erie when they were traveling on the vaudeville circuit. When he claimed he had married Dolores in Erie he was miles away in New York, on Broadway. More intriguing, there is no record anywhere of his marriage to Dolores, if it happened. And there are no wedding photos, either. But he never forgot Louise and quietly sent her money in her later years."&lt;ref name="Sheridan 2014" /&gt;
  
[[Dolores Hope|Dolores (DeFina) Reade]] had been one of Hope's co-stars on Broadway in ''Roberta''. The couple adopted four children: Linda (in 1939), Tony (1940), Kelly (1946), and Eleanora,  known as Nora (1946).{{sfn|Quirk|1998|pp=86–87}} From them, they had several grandchildren, including Andrew, Miranda, and Zachary Hope. Tony (as Anthony J. Hope) served as a presidential appointee in the [[George H. W. Bush]] and Clinton administrations and in a variety of posts under Presidents [[Gerald Ford]] and [[Ronald Reagan]].&lt;ref name="NY Times July 2004" /&gt;

In 1935, the couple lived in Manhattan. From 1937 until his death, Hope lived at 10346 Moorpark Street in [[Toluca Lake, Los Angeles|Toluca Lake, California]].&lt;ref&gt;1940 US Census via Ancestry.com&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Extramarital affairs ===
[[File:Bob Hope and Dorothy Lamour in Road to Bali.jpg|thumb|right|With [[Dorothy Lamour]] in ''[[Road to Bali]]'']]
Hope had a reputation as a womanizer and continued to see other women throughout his marriage.{{sfn|Quirk|1998|pp=82, 90}} As Zoglin wrote in ''Hope: Entertainer of the Century'', "Bob Hope had affairs with chorus girls, beauty queens, singers and showbiz wannabes up into his 70s. He had a different girl on his arm every night. He was still having affairs into his 80s..."

As just one example among many, in 1949 while Hope was in [[Dallas]] on a publicity tour for his radio show, he met [[Barbara Payton]], a contract player at [[Universal Studios]], who at the time was on her own public relations jaunt. Shortly thereafter, Hope set up Payton in an apartment in Hollywood.{{sfn|O'Dowd|2006|p=65}} The arrangement soured as Hope was not able to satisfy Payton's definition of generosity and her need for attention.{{sfn|O'Dowd|2006|pp=66, 67}} Hope paid her off to end the affair quietly. Payton later revealed the affair in an article printed in July 1956 in the tell-all magazine ''[[Confidential (magazine)|Confidential]]''.{{sfn|O'Dowd|2006|p=311}} "Hope was&amp;nbsp;... at times a mean-spirited individual with the ability to respond with a ruthless vengeance when sufficiently provoked."{{sfn|O'Dowd|2006|p=313}} His advisors counseled him to avoid further publicity by ignoring the ''Confidential'' exposé.{{sfn|O'Dowd|2006|p=313}} "Barbara's&amp;nbsp;... revelations caused a minor ripple&amp;nbsp;... and then quickly sank without causing any appreciable damage to Bob Hope's legendary career."{{sfn|O'Dowd|2006|p=313}}

According to [[Arthur Marx]]'s 1993 Hope biography, ''The Secret Life of Bob Hope'', Hope's subsequent long-term affair with actress [[Marilyn Maxwell]] was so open that the Hollywood community routinely referred to her as "Mrs. Bob Hope".&lt;ref name="Arthur Marx 1993"/&gt;

=== Vision philanthropy ===

Hope, who suffered from vision problems for much of his adult life, served as an active honorary chairman on the board of [[Fight for Sight (U.S.)|Fight for Sight]], a nonprofit organization in the United States which funds medical research in vision and ophthalmology. He hosted its ''Lights On'' telecast in 1960 and donated $100,000 to establish the Bob Hope Fight for Sight Fund.&lt;ref name="Fight for Sight"/&gt; Hope recruited numerous top celebrities for the annual "Lights On" fundraiser. As an example, he hosted boxing champion [[Joe Frazier]], actress [[Yvonne De Carlo]], and singer-actor [[Sergio Franchi]] as headliners for the April 25, 1971, show at Philharmonic Hall in [[Milwaukee]].&lt;ref name="Wilson 1971"/&gt;

== His later years ==

Hope continued an active entertainment career past his 75th birthday, concentrating on his television specials and USO tours.

Although he had given up starring in feature films after ''Cancel My Reservation'', he made several cameos in various films and co-starred with [[Don Ameche]] in the 1986 TV movie ''A Masterpiece of Murder''.&lt;ref name="Turner Movies" /&gt; A television special created for his 80th birthday in 1983 at the [[Kennedy Center]] in Washington, D.C., featured President Ronald Reagan, actress Lucille Ball, comedian-actor-writer [[George Burns]] (a fellow centenarian), and many others.&lt;ref name="TV.com" /&gt; In 1985, he was presented with the Life Achievement Award at the [[Kennedy Center Honors]],&lt;ref name="Kennedy Center" /&gt; and in 1998 he was appointed an honorary Knight Commander of the Most Excellent [[Order of the British Empire]] (OBE) by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]]. Upon accepting the appointment, Hope quipped, "I'm speechless. 70 years of ad lib material and I'm speechless."&lt;ref name="CBC News" /&gt;

In July 1997, he attended the funeral of [[Jimmy Stewart]], where many pointed out his frail appearance.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/USA-CELEBRITIES-ATTEND-MEMORIAL-CEREMONY-FOR-ACTOR-JIMMY-STEWART/5f9bc3ae3916555240cf17d55d304f72?query=CELEBRITY+NEWS&amp;current=3&amp;orderBy=Relevance&amp;hits=30&amp;referrer=search&amp;search=%2Fsearch%3Fquery%3DCELEBRITY%2520NEWS%26allFilters%3DBob%2520Hope%3APeople&amp;allFilters=Bob+Hope%3APeople&amp;productType=IncludedProducts&amp;page=1&amp;b=304f72&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 95, Hope made an appearance at the 50th anniversary of the [[Primetime Emmy Awards]] with [[Milton Berle]] and [[Sid Caesar]]. Contemporaries [[Fay Wray]] and [[Gloria Stuart]] were also present.&lt;ref name="Gallo 1998"/&gt; Two years later, he was present at the opening of the Bob Hope Gallery of American Entertainment at the [[Library of Congress]]. The Library of Congress has presented two major exhibitions about Hope's life: "Hope for America: Performers, Politics and Pop Culture" and "Bob Hope and American Variety."&lt;ref name="myloc hopeforamerica"/&gt;&lt;ref name="loc bobhope"/&gt;

Hope celebrated his 100th birthday on May 29, 2003.&lt;ref name="USA Today May 2003"/&gt; He is among a small group of notable centenarians in the field of [[List of centenarians (actors, filmmakers and entertainers)|entertainment]]. To mark this event, the intersection of [[Hollywood and Vine]] in Los Angeles was named "Bob Hope Square" and his centennial was declared "Bob Hope Day" in 35 states. Even at 100, Hope maintained his self-deprecating sense of humor, quipping, "I'm so old, they've canceled my [[blood type]]."&lt;ref name="bbcdeath"/&gt; He converted to Roman Catholicism late in life.&lt;ref name="seeing-stars St Charles"/&gt;

== Illness and death ==
[[File:BobHopeUSO.jpg|thumb|right|150px|At a [[USO]] show]]
In 1998, five years before his death, a prepared obituary written by [[the Associated Press]] inadvertently was released, resulting in Hope's death being announced on the floor of the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]].&lt;ref name="c-span June 1998"/&gt;{{sfn|Quirk|1998|p=313}} However, Hope remained in relatively good health until late in his old age, though he became somewhat frail in his last few years.{{sfn|Grudens|2002|p=148}} In June 2000, he spent nearly a week in a California hospital being treated for [[gastrointestinal bleeding]].&lt;ref name="CNN June 2000"/&gt; In  August 2001, he spent close to two weeks in a hospital recovering from [[pneumonia]].&lt;ref name="guardian September 2001"/&gt;

[[File:Bob Hope Grave.JPG|thumb|150px|Graves of Bob and Dolores Hope, on the grounds of the Mission San Fernando Rey de Espana]]

On the morning of July 27, 2003, Hope died of pneumonia at the age of 100 at his home in [[Toluca Lake, Los Angeles|Toluca Lake, California]].&lt;ref name="bbcdeath" /&gt; His grandson Zach Hope told TV interviewer [[Soledad O'Brien]] that, when asked on his deathbed where he wanted to be buried, Hope told his wife, Dolores, "Surprise me."&lt;ref name="CNN July 29, 2003"/&gt; He was interred in the Bob Hope Memorial Garden at [[San Fernando Mission Cemetery]] in Los Angeles, joined in 2011 by Dolores when she died—four months after her 102nd birthday.&lt;ref name="Doyle 2005"/&gt; After his death, newspaper cartoonists worldwide paid tribute to his work for the USO, and some featured drawings of [[Bing Crosby]], who had died in 1977,  welcoming Hope to Heaven.&lt;ref name="fac-assoc.org"/&gt;

As a final honor and tribute to his life of service to the [[USO]] and to men and women of the United States Military, on July 30, 2003, the United States Congress passed the '''Bob Hope Arlington Honors Act of 2003''', which "Directs the Secretary of the Army to permit the burial of Leslie Townes (Bob) Hope of California, an honorary veteran of the armed forces, in Arlington National Cemetery, Virginia, upon the request of his family."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.congress.gov/bill/108th-congress/senate-bill/1489&lt;/ref&gt;

Hope's [[Modernist]] {{convert|23366|sqft|m2|0|sing=on}} home, built to resemble a volcano, was designed in 1973 by [[John Lautner]]. It is located above [[Palm Springs]], with panoramic views of the [[Coachella Valley]] and the [[San Jacinto Mountains]].
