'''Gerald Isaac Stiller''' (born June 3, 1927) is an American comedian and actor. He spent many years in the comedy team [[Stiller and Meara]] with his wife, [[Anne Meara]]. He later played [[Frank Costanza]] on the [[National Broadcasting Company|NBC]] sitcom ''[[Seinfeld]]'' and [[Arthur Spooner]] on the [[Columbia Broadcasting Company|CBS]] comedy series ''[[The King of Queens]]''.&lt;ref name="Bjorklund"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dennis Bjorklund|title=Seinfeld Reference: The Complete Encyclopedia with Biographies, Character Profiles &amp; Episode Summaries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9RyY2Mtqk54C&amp;pg=PT36|publisher=Praetorian Publishing|isbn=978-0-9679852-4-4|pages=36–|quote=Best remembered for his five-year stint on "Seinfeld" in a recurring regular role, Jerry Stiller ... is a veteran actor with a long history of stage performances.

==Early life==
The eldest of four children,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accuracyproject.org/cbe-Stiller,Jerry.html|title=Jerry Stiller profile at|publisher=Accuracyproject.org|accessdate=2013-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stiller was born at Unity Hospital in [[Brooklyn, New York]], the son of Bella (''[[née]]'' Citron; 1902{{ndash}}1954) and William Stiller (1896{{ndash}}1999), a bus driver.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmreference.com/film/32/Jerry-Stiller.html Jerry Stiller profile], filmreference.com; accessed August 4, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; His family is [[Jews|Jewish]]. His paternal grandparents immigrated from [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] (modern southern Poland and Western Ukraine), and his mother was born in [[Poland]].&lt;ref name="Stiller2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jerry Stiller|title=Married to Laughter: A Love Story Featuring Anne Meara|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j3kb7JaHLZcC&amp;pg=PA19|date=8 August 2000|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|isbn=978-0-7432-1146-8|pages=19–}}&lt;/ref&gt; He lived in the [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn|Williamsburg]] and [[East New York]] neighborhoods before his family moved to the [[Lower East Side]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/dec2003/nf20031212_2940_db008.htm Jerry Stiller's Own Private East Side]&lt;/ref&gt; where he attended [[Seward Park High School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sewardparkhs.com/Famous-Alumni|title=Famous Alumni|publisher=Sewardparkhs.com|accessdate=2013-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon his return from service in World War II,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.cornell.edu/stories/2008/04/jerry-stiller-brings-down-house]&lt;/ref&gt; Stiller attended [[Syracuse University]], earning a [[bachelor's degree]] in Speech and Drama in 1950. In the 1953 Phoenix Theater production of Coriolanus (produced by [[John Houseman]]), Stiller (along with [[Gene Saks]] and [[Jack Klugman]]) formed "the best trio of Shakespearian clowns that [he] had ever seen on any stage".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Houseman|first=John|title=Front &amp; Center|year=1979|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|location=New York|isbn=0-671-24328-4|page=439}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stiller and Meara==
The comedy team [[Stiller and Meara]], composed of Stiller and wife, [[Anne Meara]], was successful in the 1960s and 1970s, with numerous appearances on television variety programs, mainly on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]''.&lt;ref name="Ross2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeffrey Ross|title=I Only Roast the Ones I Love: Busting Balls Without Burning Bridges|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=39wzWouw4nkC&amp;pg=PT163|date=September 15, 2009|publisher=Gallery Books|isbn=978-1-4391-6420-4|pages=163–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their career declined as variety series gradually disappeared, but they subsequently forged a career in radio commercials, notably the campaign for Blue Nun wine. They starred in their own syndicated five-minute sketch comedy show, ''Take Five with Stiller and Meara'' (1977–1978).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Terrace|first1=Vincent|title=Encyclopedia of Television Series, Pilots and Specials, Volume 2|date=1985|publisher=VNR AG|isbn=0918432618|pages=404|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=AKlgjBCPPnsC&amp;lpg=PA404&amp;ots=szcRUMiUju&amp;dq=Take%20Five%20with%20Stiller%20and%20Meara&amp;pg=PA404#v=onepage&amp;q=Take%20Five%20with%20Stiller%20and%20Meara&amp;f=false|accessdate=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1979 to 1982, Stiller and Meara hosted ''HBO Sneak Previews'', a half-hour show produced monthly on which they described the movies and programs to be featured in the coming month.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmreference.com/film/32/Jerry-Stiller.html Jerry Stiller profile], Filmreference.com; accessed May 24, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; They also did some comedy sketches between show discussions. The duo's own 1986 TV sitcom, ''[[The Stiller and Meara Show]]'', in which Stiller played the deputy mayor of New York City and Meara portrayed his wife, a TV commercial actress, was not successful.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

==Resurgence==

===''Seinfeld''===
Stiller played the short-tempered [[Frank Costanza]], the father of [[George Costanza]] in the sitcom ''[[Seinfeld]]'' from 1993 to 1998. He was nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series in 1997, and won the American Comedy Award for Funniest Male Guest Appearance in a TV Series for his portrayal of Frank Costanza.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

===''The King of Queens''===
After ''Seinfeld'''s run ended, Stiller had planned on retiring, but [[Kevin James]] asked him to join the cast of ''[[The King of Queens]]''. James, who played the leading role of [[Doug Heffernan]], had told Stiller that he needed him in order to have a successful show. {{citation needed|date=March 2008}}  Stiller obliged, and played the role of [[Arthur Spooner]], the father of [[Carrie Heffernan]], in the sitcom from 1998 until 2007. Stiller said this role tested his acting ability more than any others have and that, before being a part of ''The King of Queens'', he only saw himself as a "decent actor".{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

===Other appearances===
Stiller played himself in filmed [[sketch comedy|skit]]s, opening and closing Canadian rock band [[Rush (band)|Rush]]'s 30th Anniversary Tour concerts in 2004. These appearances are seen on the band's DVD ''[[R30: 30th Anniversary World Tour]]'', released in 2005. Stiller later appeared in [[cameo appearance|cameo]]s in later in-concert films for the band's 2007-2008 [[Snakes &amp; Arrows Tour]]. Stiller appeared on Dick Clark's ''[[Pyramid (game show)|$10,000 Pyramid]]'' show in the 1970s, and footage of the appearance was edited into an episode of ''The King of Queens'' to assist the storyline about his character being a contestant on the show, but that after losing, he was bitter about the experience as he never received his parting gift, a lifetime supply of "[[Rice-A-Roni]], the San Francisco Treat".{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}  He also made several appearances on the game show [[Tattletales]] with his wife Anne.

In the late 1990s, Stiller appeared in a series of [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] television commercials as the ghost of deceased [[Green Bay Packers]] head coach [[Vince Lombardi]]. Stiller has appeared in various motion pictures, most notably ''[[Zoolander]]'' (2001) and ''[[Secret of the Andes (film)|Secret of the Andes]]'' (1999). On February 9, 2007, Stiller and Meara were honored with a joint star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. On October 28, 2010, the couple appeared on an episode of ''[[The Daily Show with Jon Stewart]]''. Stiller voiced the announcer on the children's educational show ''[[Crashbox]]''. Starting in October 2010, Stiller and Meara began starring in a [[Yahoo]] web series, ''[[Stiller &amp; Meara]]'' from [[Red Hour Productions|Red Hour Digital]], in which they discussed current topics. Each episode was about two minutes long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stillerandmeara.com|title=Watch Stiller and Meara online|publisher=Stillerandmeara.com|accessdate=2013-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2012, Stiller has been a spokesman for [[Xfinity]].

==As author==
Stiller wrote the foreword to the book ''[[Festivus]]: The Holiday for the Rest of Us'' ({{ISBN|0-446-69674-9}}) by [[Allen Salkin]], released on October 26, 2005. Stiller's memoir, ''Married to Laughter: A Love Story Featuring Anne Meara'', was published by Simon &amp; Schuster © 2000; {{ISBN|0-684-86903-9}}.

==Personal life==
Stiller was married to [[Anne Meara Stiller]] from 1954 until her death on October 17, 2014. The two met in an agent's office.  Anne was upset about an interaction with the casting agent, so Jerry took her out for coffee (all he could afford) and they were together ever since. Their son is actor-comedian [[Ben Stiller]] (born 1965) and their daughter is actress Amy Stiller (born 1961). He has two grandchildren through Ben.
