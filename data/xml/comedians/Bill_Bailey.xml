'''Mark Robert Bailey''' (born 13 January 1965) better known as '''Bill Bailey''', is an English comedian, musician, singer, actor, TV and radio presenter and author. Bailey is well known for his role in ''[[Black Books]]'' and for his appearances on ''[[Never Mind the Buzzcocks]]'', ''[[Have I Got News for You]]'' and ''[[QI]]'', as well as his extensive stand-up work.

Bailey was listed by ''[[The Observer]]'' as one of the 50 funniest acts in British comedy in 2003&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2003/dec/07/comedy.thebestofbritishcomedy1|title=The 50 funniest people in Britain (part one)|publisher=The Guardian|date=7 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In 2007, and again in 2010, he was voted the seventh greatest stand-up comic on [[Channel 4]]'s ''100 Greatest Stand-Ups''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-100-greatest-stand-ups/articles/greatest-stand-ups-of-all-time|title=The 100 Greatest Stand-Ups&amp;nbsp;– Announcements&amp;nbsp;– Greatest Stand-Ups of All Time!|publisher=Channel 4|date=11 April 2010|accessdate=26 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Bailey was born in [[Bath, Somerset]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/oct/29/bill-bailey-comedian-q-and-a|title=Bill Bailey: ‘The worst thing anyone’s said to me? “You’re that bloke off the Hairy Bikers”’|last=Greenstreet|first=Rosanna|date=2016-10-29|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and spent most of his childhood in [[Keynsham]], a town situated between Bath and [[Bristol]] in the [[West of England]]. His father was a medical practitioner and his mother a hospital ward sister. His maternal grandparents lived in an annexe, built on the side of the house by his maternal grandfather who was a stonemason and builder. Two rooms at the front of the family house were for his father's surgery.&lt;ref name="DID BB"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Desert Island Discs featuring Bill Bailey|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/factual/desertislanddiscs_20080608.shtml|series=Desert Island Discs|serieslink=Desert Island Discs|network=[[BBC]]|station=[[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]]|airdate=8 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bailey was educated at [[King Edward's School, Bath|King Edward's School]],&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/11-bristol-celebrities-go-school-17024 Where did these 11 Bristol celebrities go to school?]",''Bristol Post'', 2 April 2017 (Accessed 4 April 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; an independent school in Bath&lt;ref name="KES"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kesbath.com/cgi-local/artman/exec/search.cgi?cat=1&amp;fields=art_num&amp;keyword=1553&amp;template=index/newspage.htm |title=Comedy Map of Britain |accessdate=2 February 2007 |publisher=[[King Edward's School, Bath]] |year=2007 |work=News Events &amp; Diary |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929195711/http://www.kesbath.com/cgi-local/artman/exec/search.cgi?cat=1&amp;fields=art_num&amp;keyword=1553&amp;template=index%2Fnewspage.htm |archivedate=29 September 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; where he was initially a highly academic pupil winning most of the prizes. At about the age of 15, he started to become distracted from school work when he realised the thrill of performance as a member of a school band called Behind Closed Doors, which played mostly original work. He was the only pupil at his school to study [[GCE Advanced Level|A-level]] music and he passed with an A grade. He also claims to have been good at sport (captain of KES 2nd XI cricket team 1982), which often surprised his teachers. He would often combine music and sport by leading the singing on the long coach trip back from away rugby fixtures. It was here that he was given his nickname Bill by his music teacher, Ian Phipps, for being able to play the song "[[Won't You Come Home Bill Bailey]]" so well on the guitar.&lt;ref name="DID BB"/&gt;

He started studies for an English degree at [[Westfield College]] of the [[University of London]] but left after a year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/comedy/features/bill-bailey-people-are-obsessed-by-how-i-look-1027334.html "People are obsessed by how I look"], ''The Independent'', 21 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; He is a classically trained musician and received an Associateship Diploma from the [[London College of Music]] as well as being made an honorary member of the Society of Crematorium Organists. He performed with a boy band "The Famous Five".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billbailey.co.uk/biography/|title=Biography|author=Vanilla Storm Limited|work=billbailey.co.uk|accessdate=2 December 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208050605/http://billbailey.co.uk/biography/|archivedate=8 December 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bailey often mythologises his early years in his stand-up. In his show ''Bewilderness'', he claims to have attended Bovington Gurney School of Performing Arts and Owl Sanctuary. He talks about a succession of jobs he had before becoming a comedian, including lounge pianist, crematorium organist, door-to-door door-salesman and accompanist for a mind-reading dog on the Children's TV show ''[[Motormouth]]''. A clip of Bailey's appearance in the dog's routine was shown during his ''[[Room 101 (TV series)|Room 101]]'' appearance.

Bailey also talks about his role as a "Disenfranchised Owl" in an experimental Welsh theatre troupe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ross|first=Deborah|title=Bill Bailey: The laid-back stand-up guy|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/bill-bailey-the-laidback-standup-guy-613425.html|accessdate=1 September 2011|newspaper=The Independent|date=7 October 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other acting roles included a part in a [[Workers' Revolutionary Party (UK)|Workers' Revolutionary Party]] stage production called ''The Printers'', which also featured [[Vanessa Redgrave]] and [[Frances de la Tour]].

Until 24 February 2018, nobody was quite sure when Bill Bailey was born.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/BillBailey/status/967476430463479808|title=Thanks for all the lovely birthday messages.

==Politics and activism==
Bailey is a supporter of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and appeared in the Labour Party's fifth party election broadcast of the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 General Election]] campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rro9m9RCLzI&amp;feature=player_embedded|title=Sixty Seconds|publisher=YouTube|date=3 May 2010|accessdate=26 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was critical of Labour during the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|2015 election campaign]], describing leader [[Ed Miliband]] as "a plastic bag caught in a tree", adding that "no one knows how he got up there and no one can be bothered to get him down".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sunnation.co.uk/jacking-it-in-the-labour-luvvies-leaving-ed/|title=Jacking it in – the Labour luvvies leaving Ed – Sun Nation|work=Sun Nation|accessdate=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bailey is an outspoken feminist and supporter of the [[Fawcett Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bill Bailey |url=http://www.fawcettsociety.org.uk/index.asp?PageID=447 |publisher=Fawcett Society |accessdate=22 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928122323/http://www.fawcettsociety.org.uk/index.asp?PageID=447 |archivedate=28 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Moore|first=Suzanne|title=What's the nicest thing a man can do for a woman?

In 2015, Bailey endorsed [[Jeremy Corbyn]]'s [[Jeremy Corbyn Labour Party leadership campaign, 2015|campaign]] in [[Labour Party (UK) leadership election, 2015|Labour Party leadership election]]. He said "Corbyn's nomination showed there is a kind of craving for a bit of honest speaking, a bit of principled plain speaking. But I think he is in a bit of a bind. Nuanced debate doesn't cut it in the toxic, political atmosphere. He’s having a fast-forward of his own political evolution, having to become 'a politician' – the thing he never was."&lt;ref name="standard"&gt;{{cite news |last=Ellis|first=David|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/comedy/bill-bailey-interview-a3134216.html|title=Bill Bailey on happiness, Jeremy Corbyn and how turning 50 changed him|work= |location= |publisher=''[[London Evening Standard]]''|date=10 December 2015|accessdate=1 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bailey is a patron of [[International Animal Rescue]] and has been instrumental in the organisation's campaign to rescue [[Tame bear|dancing bears]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dancing bears 'tradition' to be halted in India|url=http://www.wildlifeextra.com/go/news/dancing-bears.html|accessdate=12 December 2011|newspaper=Wildlife Extra|date=October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Comic joins animal protest|url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/2243922.comic_joins_animal_protest/|accessdate=12 December 2011|newspaper=The Argus|date=3 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also campaigned for the [[Sumatran Orangutan]] Society. For his works in environmental conservation, he received an [[honorary doctorate]] in conservation and sustainability from the Australian [[University of the Sunshine Coast]] in October 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usc.edu.au/university/news-and-events/events-calendar/2014/october/bill-bailey-honorary-doctorate-ceremony-at-university-of-the-sunshine-coast |title=Bill Bailey&amp;nbsp;— Honorary Doctorate ceremony at University of the Sunshine Coast |accessdate=14 October 2014 |publisher=University of the Sunshine Coast |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141014091739/http://www.usc.edu.au/university/news-and-events/events-calendar/2014/october/bill-bailey-honorary-doctorate-ceremony-at-university-of-the-sunshine-coast |archivedate=14 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Early stand-up===
Bailey began touring the country with comedians such as [[Mark Lamarr]]. In 1984, he formed a double act, the Rubber Bishops, with [[Toby Longworth]] (a fellow former pupil at King Edward's, Bath). It was there that Bailey began developing his own style, mixing in musical [[parody|parodies]] with [[deconstruction]]s of or variations on traditional jokes ("How many [[Amoeba (genus)|amoebas]] does it take to change a lightbulb? One, no two! No four! No eight..."). According to comedy folklore, after a reviewer once criticised his act for its lack of jokes, Bailey returned the following night, at [[Queen Margaret University|Queen Margaret College]], Edinburgh, to perform a set composed entirely of punchlines. Longworth left to join the RSC in 1989 and was replaced by Martin Stubbs.

Stubbs later quit to pursue a more serious career, and in 1994 Bailey performed ''Rock'' at the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] with [[Sean Lock]], a show about an ageing rockstar and his [[Road crew|roadie]], script-edited by comedy writer Jim Miller. It was later serialised for the [[Mark Radcliffe]] show on [[BBC Radio 1]]. The show's attendances were not impressive and on one occasion the only person in the audience was comedian [[Dominic Holland]]. Bailey almost gave up comedy to take up a telesales job.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/features/bill-bailey-for-whom-the-bill-toils-6157771.html|location=London|work=The Independent|title=Bill Bailey: For whom the Bill toils|date=18 November 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He went solo the next year with the one man show ''Bill Bailey's Cosmic Jam''. The show led to a recording at the [[Bloomsbury Theatre]] in London which was broadcast in 1997 on Channel 4 as a one-hour special called ''Bill Bailey Live''. It was not until 2005 that this was released on DVD uncut and under its original title. It marked the first time that Bailey had been able to tie together his music and [[Postmodernism|post-modern]] [[joke|gags]] with the whimsical rambling style he is now known for.

After supporting [[Donna McPhail]] in 1995 and winning a ''[[Time Out (company)|Time Out]]'' award, he returned to [[Edinburgh]] in 1996 with a show that was nominated for the [[Edinburgh Comedy Awards|Perrier Comedy Award]]. Amongst the other nominees was future ''[[Black Books]]'' co-star [[Dylan Moran]], who narrowly beat him in the closest vote in the award's history.

Bailey won the Best Live Stand-Up award at the [[British Comedy Awards]] in 1999.

===Television===
Though he did not win the [[Edinburgh Comedy Awards|Perrier]] in 1996, the nomination was enough to get him noticed, and in 1998 the BBC gave him his own television show, ''[[Is It Bill Bailey?]]''

This was not Bailey's first foray into television. His debut was on the children's TV show ''[[Motormouth]]'' in the late 1980s&amp;nbsp;– playing piano for a mind-reading dog. Bailey reminisced about the experience on the BBC show ''[[Room 101 (TV series)|Room 101]]'' with [[Paul Merton]] in 2000. In 1991, he was appearing in stand-up shows such as ''The Happening'', ''Packing Them In'', ''The Stand Up Show'' and ''The Comedy Store''. He also appeared as captain on two [[panel game]]s, an [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] music quiz pilot called ''Pop Dogs'', and the Channel 4 science fiction quiz show ''[[Space Cadets (game show)|Space Cadets]]''. ''Is it Bill Bailey?'' was the first time he had written and presented his own show.

Over the next few years, Bailey made guest appearances on shows such as ''[[Have I Got News for You]]'', ''World Cup Comedy'', ''[[Room 101 (TV series)|Room 101]]'', ''[[Des O'Connor]] Tonight'', ''Coast to Coast'' and three episodes of off-beat Channel 4 sitcom ''[[Spaced]]'', in which he played comic-shop manager Bilbo Bagshot.

In 1998, [[Dylan Moran]] approached him with the pilot script for ''[[Black Books]]'', a Channel 4 sitcom about a cold-hearted bookshop owner, his nice-guy assistant, and their socially awkward female friend. It was commissioned in 2000, and Bailey took the part of the assistant [[Manny Bianco]], with Moran playing the owner Bernard and [[Tamsin Greig]] the friend, Fran. Three series of six episodes each were made.

When [[Sean Hughes (comedian)|Sean Hughes]] left his long-term role as a team captain on ''[[Never Mind the Buzzcocks]]'' in 2002, Bailey became his successor. His style quickly blended into the show, possibly helped by his background in music. He soon developed a rapport with host [[Mark Lamarr]], who continually teased him about his looks and his pre-occupation with woodland animals. It was announced on 18 September 2008 that Bailey would leave the series and be replaced by a series of guest captains including [[Jack Dee]] and [[Dermot O'Leary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7623854.stm|work=BBC News|title=Bailey says goodbye to Buzzcocks|date=18 September 2008|accessdate=18 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; While touring in 2009, Bailey joked that the main reason for leaving the show was a lack of desire to continue humming [[Britney Spears]]' ''[[Toxic (song)|Toxic]]'' to little known figures in the [[Independent music|indie music]] scene. During this time he also left his position as "curator" of ''[[the Museum of Curiosity]]'', and declared his intention to "retire" from panel games, although he has since appeared on ''QI'' many more times and hosted ''Have I Got News For You''.

Bailey has appeared frequently on the intellectual panel game ''[[QI]]'' since it began in 2003, alongside host [[Stephen Fry]] and regular panellist [[Alan Davies]]; he was also the winner of the show's unaired pilot episode. Other television appearances include a cameo role in Alan Davies' drama series ''[[Jonathan Creek]]'' as failing street [[Magic (illusion)|magician]] Kenny Starkiss and obsessed guitar teacher in the "Holiday" episode of Sean Lock's ''[[15 Storeys High|Fifteen Storeys High]]''. He later appeared with Lock again as a guest on his show ''[[TV Heaven, Telly Hell]]''. He has also appeared twice on ''[[Friday Night with Jonathan Ross]]''. Bailey also hosted his own show ''[[Comic's Choice]]'', which aired in 2011.

Bailey also presented ''Wild Thing I Love You'' which began on [[Channel 4]] on 15 October 2006. The series concentrates on the protection of Britain's wild animals, and has included re-homing [[badger]]s, [[owl]]s and [[European Water Vole|water voles]].

Bailey appeared in the second series of the E4 teenage "dramedy" ''[[Skins (UK TV series)|Skins]]'' playing Maxxie's dad, Walter Oliver. In episode 1, Walter struggles with his son's desire to be a dancer, instead wishing him to become a builder, which is what he himself does for a living. Walter is married to Jackie, played by [[Fiona Allen]].

Bailey appeared on the first episode of ''[[Grand Designs|Grand Designs Live]]'' on 4 May 2008, helping [[Kevin McCloud]] build his eco-friendly home. In 2009, Bailey appeared in the BBC show ''[[Hustle (TV series)|Hustle]]'' as the character "Cyclops", a side-line character. In autumn 2009, Bailey presented ''[[Bill Bailey's Birdwatching Bonanza]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bill Bailey's Birdwatching Bonanza|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1582688/|publisher=Internet Movie database|accessdate=7 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To continue his foray into [[natural history]], Bailey presented [[ITV1]]'s half-hour wildlife mini-series ''Baboons With Bill Bailey''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billbailey.co.uk/latestnews/2011/04/something-hairys-on-the-telly-tonight-also-features-baboons/|title=Something hairy's on the telly tonight!

Bill Bailey played Droxil, a Harvest Ranger from the Planet Androzani Major, in the 2011 Christmas Special of ''[[Doctor Who]]'', titled ''[[The Doctor, the Widow and the Wardrobe]]''.

In 2009, Bailey presented a project about the explorer and naturalist [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], in the form of an Indonesian travelogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://wallacefund.info/comedian-bill-baileys-new-show-about-alfred-russel-wallace|title=Comedian Bill Bailey's new show about Alfred Russel Wallace|accessdate=9 November 2010|work=The Alfred Russel Wallace Website}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bailey said in an interview that Wallace had been "airbrushed out of history", and that he feels a "real affinity" with him. In 2013, to coincide with the centenary of Wallace's death, Bailey presented a two-part documentary, ''Bill Bailey's Jungle Hero'', first broadcast on [[BBC Two]] on 21 and 28 April 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0160p0s |title=Bill Bailey's Jungle Hero |publisher=BBC |date=7 June 2013 |accessdate=26 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He travelled around producing and filming the series in [[Indonesia]] and [[Borneo]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/media/s3584589.htm] ABC Triple J interview with Bill Bailey&lt;/ref&gt;

===International tours===
[[File:Bill-Bailey.jpg|thumb|right|Bailey in concert, 2007]]
In 2001, Bailey began touring the globe with ''Bewilderness''. A recording of a performance in [[Swansea]] was released on DVD the same year, and the show was broadcast on Channel 4 that Christmas. A modified version of it also proved successful in America, and in 2002 Bailey released a CD of a recording at the WestBeth Theatre in New York City. The show contained his popular music parodies (such as Unisex Chip Shop, a [[Billy Bragg]] tribute, which he also performed with Bragg himself at the 2005 [[Glastonbury Festival]]), "three men in a pub" jokes (including one in the style of [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]) and deconstructions of television themes such as ''[[Countdown (game show)|Countdown]]'' and ''[[The Magic Roundabout]]''. A ''Bewilderness'' CD was sold outside gigs, a mixture of studio recordings of songs and monologues Bailey had performed in the past&amp;nbsp;– it was later released in shops as ''Bill Bailey: The Ultimate Collection... Ever!''  That same year he also presented a Channel 4 countdown, ''Top Ten Prog Rock''.

Bailey premiered his show ''Part Troll'' at the [[2003 Edinburgh Festival Fringe]]. A critical and commercial success, he then transferred it to the West End, where tickets sold out in under 24 hours, and new dates had to be added. He continued to tour it all over the UK as well as in the US, Australia and New Zealand. Bailey expanded on subjects such as the [[Iraq War|war on Iraq]]. He also talks extensively about drugs, at one point asking the audience to name different ways of baking [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]. A DVD was released in 2004.

2005 saw the release of his 1995 show ''Bill Bailey's Cosmic Jam''. The two-disc set also contained a [[director's cut]] of ''Bewilderness'', which featured a routine on [[Stephen Hawking]]'s ''[[A Brief History of Time]]'' not seen in the original version.

Bailey performed at show at the [[2006 Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] entitled ''[[Steampunk]]''.

Bailey appeared at the [[Beautiful Days (festival)|Beautiful Days festival]] in August 2007. The UK leg of the ''Tinselworm'' tour enjoyed three sell-out nights at the [[MEN Arena]] in Manchester, Europe's largest indoor arena, and culminated with a sell-out performance at [[Wembley Arena]].

Early in 2007, a petition was started to express fans' wishes to see him cast as a dwarf in [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' films]], after his stand-up routine mentioned auditioning for [[Gimli (Middle-earth)|Gimli]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]''. The petition reached its goal in the early days of January, and was sent to the producers. It was hoped that as the ''Tinselworm'' tour took him to [[Wellington]] in New Zealand where the film was in pre-production, that he would be able to audition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiredmag.co.uk/archive-feature.php?issue_id=50&amp;feature_id=69 |title=All That Glitters |accessdate=31 December 2007 |work=Wired, Croydon's listings magazine |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080104022358/http://www.wiredmag.co.uk/archive-feature.php?issue_id=50 |archivedate= 4 January 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Dandelion Mind]]'' was released on DVD on 22 November 2010.

In 2012, his world tour was entitled ''Qualmpeddler'', which toured England as well as returning to Australia and New Zealand in August and September 2012.

===Music===
[[File:Bill Bailey - SYTYF.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Bill Bailey hosting ''[[So You Think You're Funny]]'']]
Bailey is a talented pianist and guitarist and has [[perfect pitch]]; of this he has said {{quote|"Perfect pitch ... occurs entirely at random in about one in every 10,000 of us, and I'm one of them. From as early as I can remember, I was able to pick out the pitch of things, not just instruments but washing machines, vacuum cleaners, dentists' drills."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2004/oct/15/4|title=Weird science|work=The Guardian|location=London|accessdate=13 April 2010|date=15 October 2004|first=Bill|last=Bailey| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100330063331/http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2004/oct/15/4| archivedate= 30 March 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
His stand-up routines often feature music from genres such as jazz, rock (most notably [[progressive rock|prog rock]] from the early seventies), [[Drum and bass|drum'n'bass]], classical, and even [[theme song]]s, usually for comic value. Favourite instruments include the keyboard, guitar, [[theremin]], [[kazoo]] and [[Bongo drum|bongos]]. He also mentioned in an interview that he has achieved Grade 6 [[Clarinet]]. He was part of punk band Beergut 100,&lt;ref name="scots"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://living.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=1484&amp;id=1247052006|title=Looking back at a week of Fringe madness|accessdate=2 January 2007|work=The Scotsman|location=UK|year=2006|author=Simon Neville}}&lt;/ref&gt; which he founded in 1995 with comedy writer Jim Miller and also featured [[Martin Trenaman]] and Phil Whelans, with [[Kevin Eldon]] as lead singer.&lt;ref name="eldon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.notbbc.co.uk/features/15/kevin_eldon_interview.html|title=Kevin Eldon Interview|accessdate=2 January 2007|publisher=notbbc.co.uk|year=2006|author=Natbat}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band performed at the [[2006 Edinburgh Festival Fringe]].&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/edinburgh2006/story/0,,1826826,00.html|title=The essential guide to Edinburgh|accessdate=2 January 2007|work=The Guardian|location=London|date=28 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trenaman and Welans had previously appeared in ''Cosmic Jam'' under the name "The Stan Ellis Experiment", and Trenaman and Eldon later featured with [[John Moloney (comedian)|John Moloney]] in the [[Kraftwerk]] homage "Das [[Hokey Cokey|Hokey Kokey]]" on the ''Part Troll'' tour. Bailey claims that he and the three other performers are a Kraftwerk tribute band called ''Augenblick''. To mark the final gig of the ''Part Troll'' tour on 1 January 2005, the band reappeared on stage after the "Das Hokey Kokey" joke to play an hour-long encore of music.

In February 2007, Bailey appeared twice with the [[BBC Concert Orchestra]] and [[Anne Dudley]] in a show entitled ''Cosmic Shindig''. Performed in the [[Watford Colosseum#Watford Colosseum|Colosseum]] in [[Watford]] on 24 February and in the [[Queen Elizabeth Hall]] on 26 February, the show contained orchestrally accompanied versions of many of Bailey's previously performed songs, an exploration of the instruments of the orchestra and a number of new pieces of music. The [[Queen Elizabeth Hall]] performance was broadcast on [[BBC Radio 3]] on 16 March 2007 as a part of [[Comic Relief]] 2007.

Bailey had planned to put himself forward as Britain's [[Eurovision Song Contest|Eurovision]] entry in 2008, as a result of several fan petitions encouraging him to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eurovision|url=http://www.billbailey.co.uk/latestnews/2007/07/eurovision/|publisher=Bill Bailey|accessdate=8 October 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111026090514/http://www.billbailey.co.uk/latestnews/2007/07/eurovision/|archivedate=26 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2008, he performed ''Bill Bailey's Remarkable Guide to the Orchestra'' at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] with the [[BBC Concert Orchestra]], conducted by [[Anne Dudley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bill Bailey's Remarkable Guide to the Orchestra|work=The Guardian|location=London|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/oct/17/comedy|accessdate=20 October 2008|first=Brian|last=Logan|date=17 October 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081018113223/http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2008/oct/17/comedy| archivedate= 18 October 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2009 he was a guest on ''[[Private Passions]]'', the biographical music discussion programme on BBC Radio 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=2 days left|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio3/privatepassions/|title=BBC Radio 3|publisher=BBC|accessdate=26 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011, Bailey performed at the [[Sonisphere Festival]] in [[Knebworth]], headlining the Saturn Stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bhamra|first=Satvir|url=http://amplified.tv/2011/03/28/bill-bailey-to-headline-sonisphere/|title=Bill Bailey to headline Sonisphere|publisher=Amplified.tv|accessdate=26 August 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302063226/http://amplified.tv/2011/03/28/bill-bailey-to-headline-sonisphere/|archivedate=2 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He released an album, ''In Metal'', using songs played at Sonisphere, later that year.
