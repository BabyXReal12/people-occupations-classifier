'''David Hyde Pierce''' (born April 3, 1959)&lt;ref name=rootsweb /&gt; is an American actor, director, and comedian.

Pierce is known for playing the psychiatrist [[Niles Crane|Dr. Niles Crane]] on the [[NBC]] sitcom ''[[Frasier]]'', for which he won four [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series|Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series]] during the show's run. Pierce also has appeared on and directed for the stage. He won the 2007 [[Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Musical]] for his performance in the musical ''[[Curtains (musical)|Curtains]]''. He also played Dr. Jones in ''[[When We Rise]]''.

== Early life ==
Pierce was born '''David Pierce''' in [[Saratoga Springs, New York]]. His father, George Hyde Pierce,&lt;ref name="imdb.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001383/bio|title=David Hyde Pierce|website=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an aspiring actor, and his mother, Laura Marie (née Hughes),&lt;ref name="imdb.com" /&gt; was an insurance agent.&lt;ref name=rootsweb&gt;{{cite web|title=David Hyde Pierce profile|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~battle/celeb/pierce.htm|publisher=Rootsweb|year=2008|accessdate=2008-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He added his middle name "Hyde" to avoid confusion with another actor named David Pierce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|quotation="I did not come out of the womb with the name 'Hyde'. It was my middle name  from my dad's side of the family. His mom's maiden name. So when our film union said there was already a David Pierce, I added the name 'Hyde'"|work=New York Post|date=June 29, 2011|accessdate=August 3, 2015|url=http://pagesix.com/2011/06/29/hyde-in-a-sort-of-jekyll-role|title=Hyde in a sort of Jekyll role}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a child, Pierce frequently played organ at the local [[Bethesda Episcopal Church (Saratoga Springs)|Bethesda Episcopal Church]].&lt;ref&gt;Barbara S Wilson, Arlene Flancher, and Susan T. Erdey, ''The Episcopal Handbook'' (Moorhouse [Church] Publishing 2008), pp. 106-7, {{ISBN|978-0-8192-2329-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

While attending Yale, Pierce performed in and directed student productions, appearing in the Yale [[Gilbert &amp; Sullivan]] Society's production of ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]''. He also directed the Gilbert &amp; Sullivan Society's operetta ''[[Princess Ida]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Rizzo, Frank.

Among other roles Pierce played at Yale were in  ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'', ''[[Saint Joan (play)|Saint Joan]]'', and ''[[Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?]]''.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

== Career ==
After his graduation, Pierce moved to New York City, where during the 1980s and early 1990s he was employed in various jobs, such as selling ties at [[Bloomingdale's]] and working as a security guard, while pursuing an acting career and studying at [[Michael Howard Studios]]. During this period he played Laertes in a popular off-Broadway production of ''[[Hamlet]]'' and made his Broadway debut in 1982 in [[Christopher Durang]]'s ''[[Beyond Therapy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The Broadway League |url=http://ibdb.com/person.php?id=79363 |title=Profile at IBDb |publisher=Ibdb.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:David Hyde Pierce at 47th Emmy Awards.jpg|thumb|upright|Pierce at the 1994 Emmy Awards]]
Pierce's first big television break came in the early 1990s with [[Norman Lear]]'s political comedy, ''[[The Powers That Be (TV series)|The Powers That Be]],'' in which Pierce played Theodore, a Congressman.&lt;ref name="showperson"&gt;{{cite web|title=Showperson; the DHP Website|url=http://davidhydepierce.org/biography.html| accessdate=2008-06-19|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080602003242/http://davidhydepierce.org/biography.html|archivedate=2008-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite positive reviews from critics, the show was canceled after a brief run.

In part due to his close physical resemblance to [[Kelsey Grammer]],&lt;ref name="allinthefamily" /&gt; the producers of the ''[[Cheers]]'' [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] ''[[Frasier]]'' created the role of [[Niles Crane]] ([[Frasier Crane]]'s younger brother) for him.&lt;ref name="showperson" /&gt; Although prior to ''Frasier'' going into production, Pierce had petitioned the [[Screen Actors Guild]] to change his [[billing (filmmaking)|billing]] to David Pierce, the name he had used on the stage, the use of his middle name in the show's credits helped reinforce the actor's and the character's "snooty" image.&lt;ref name="allinthefamily"&gt;{{cite news|last=Newman|first=Bruce|title=All In Their Family|work=Los Angeles Times|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/mar/01/entertainment/ca-24256|date=1998-03-01|accessdate=2009-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; For his work on ''Frasier'', Pierce was nominated for a Best Supporting Actor [[Emmy Awards|Emmy]] a record eleven consecutive years, winning in 1995, 1998, 1999 and 2004.

Pierce also appeared alongside [[Jodie Foster]] in ''[[Little Man Tate]]'', with [[Anthony Hopkins]] in [[Oliver Stone]]'s ''[[Nixon (film)|Nixon]]'', and with [[Ewan McGregor]] in ''[[Down With Love]]''.&lt;ref name="showperson" /&gt; He provided the voice for Doctor Doppler in [[Disney]]'s 42nd animated feature, ''[[Treasure Planet]]'', Slim, a [[Phasmatodea|stick insect]] in [[Pixar]]'s ''[[A Bug's Life]]'' and [[Abe Sapien]] in [[Guillermo del Toro]]'s ''[[Hellboy (2004 film)|Hellboy]]''. In his role in ''[[Sleepless in Seattle]]'' (1993), Pierce played the brother of Meg Ryan's character, a professor at [[Johns Hopkins University]]. The movie was released three months before the start of ''Frasier''.&lt;ref name="showperson" /&gt; In 2001, he starred in the cult 1981-set summer camp comedy ''[[Wet Hot American Summer]]'', as the befuddled astrophysicist, Prof. Henry Newman.

In 2005, Pierce joined [[Tim Curry]] and others in the stage production of ''[[Spamalot]]''.&lt;ref name="showperson" /&gt; In August and September 2006, he starred as ''Lieutenant Frank Cioffi'' in ''[[Curtains (musical)|Curtains]]'', a new Kander and Ebb musical staged at the Ahmanson Theatre in [[Los Angeles]]. In March 2007, ''Curtains'' opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]&lt;ref name="showperson" /&gt; and on June 10, 2007, Pierce won the [[Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Musical]] at the 61st [[Tony Award]]s for his performance.&lt;ref name="showperson" /&gt; In his acceptance speech, Pierce said the first words he spoke on a Broadway stage were, "I'm sorry, I'm going to have to ask you to leave."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|title=David Hyde Pierce Acceptance Speech Tony Award|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4yXtF8Tb8|work=YouTube|year=2007|accessdate=2010-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 19, 2007, Pierce was awarded an Honorary [[Doctor of Fine Arts]] Degree from [[Niagara University]] in [[Lewiston, New York]].  In 1999 he was awarded an Honorary Degree from [[Skidmore College]], located in his native Saratoga Springs. In 2010, Pierce appeared in a revival of [[David Hirson]]'s play ''[[La Bête]]'' directed by [[Matthew Warchus]].  The production debuted on London's West End before moving to New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rylance, Lumley and Hyde Pierce bring La Bête to West End|url=http://www.officiallondontheatre.co.uk/news/latest/view/item109640/Rylance%252C-Lumley-and-Hyde-Pierce-bring-La-B%25EAte-to-West-End-|work=London, UK|year=2010|accessdate=2010-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2010, Pierce had his first starring film role as Warwick Wilson in the dark comedy/psychological thriller ''[[The Perfect Host]]''.

=== Voice acting ===
[[File:David Hyde Pierce at the 1995 Emmy Awards cropped.jpg|left|thumb|Pierce at the Governor's Ball dinner after the Emmy Awards in September 1995]]
Pierce is known for his distinctive voice and, like his ''[[Frasier]]'' co-star, Kelsey Grammer, is often called upon to provide voice work. His notable roles include the narrator of the movie ''[[The Mating Habits of the Earthbound Human]]'' in 1999, [[Phasmatodea|walking stick insect]] Slim in ''[[A Bug's Life]]'', Doctor Delbert Doppler in Disney's film ''[[Treasure Planet]]'', and the amphibian [[Abe Sapien]] in ''[[Hellboy (2004 film)|Hellboy]]''.&lt;ref name="showperson" /&gt; Pierce refused credit for his ''Hellboy'' role because he felt it was the performance of [[Doug Jones (actor)|Doug Jones]], and not his own voice, which ultimately brought the character of Abe Sapien to life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview|first=Doug |last=Jones|interviewer=Staci Layne|url=http://www.horror.com/php/article-1596-1.html|title=Doug Jones – Exclusive Interview|type=transcript|work=Horror.com|date=May 11, 2007|accessdate=2008-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the voice for Drix, a cold pill, in the animated comedy ''[[Osmosis Jones]]''.

In a deliberate [[in-joke]], he voiced [[Cecil bob|Cecil]], the brother of [[Kelsey Grammer]]-voiced [[Sideshow Bob]], in ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[Brother from Another Series]]", in which the two characters parallel the Frasier-Niles relationship. At one point in the episode, Cecil mistakes Bart for [[Maris Crane|Maris]], the unseen wife of Niles on ''Frasier''. He returned as Cecil in the Season 19 episode "[[Funeral for a Fiend]]" where ''[[Frasier]]'' co-star [[John Mahoney]] (who starred as [[Frasier Crane|Frasier]] and [[Niles Crane|Niles's]] father in the show) voices Dr. Robert Terwilliger, Sr., the father of Cecil and Sideshow Bob.

Pierce provided the voice of Mr. Daedalus in the 1998 Disney show ''[[Hercules: The Animated Series]]''. In 2006, he co-starred in the animated pilot for ''[[The Amazing Screw-On Head]]'' as the Screw-On Head's nemesis Emperor Zombie; however, the series was not picked up. His commercial voiceover work included ads for the [[Tassimo]] coffee system, Seattle's Metro Transit, and home furnishings retailer [[IKEA|Ikea]] Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9lyydAbWiY|title=IKEA Pax: Our Pre-Wedding Photographer Lives in Advertising|publisher=Youtube.com|date=2011-06-08|accessdate=2011-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pierce narrated an audio tour guide, ''Napa Uncorked'', in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://static.winespectator.com/webfeature/show/id/Frasiers-David-Hyde-Pierce-Leads-CD-Tour-of-Napa-Wine-Country_21480|title=Frasier's David Hyde Pierce Leads CD Tour of Napa Wine Country|last=DeBord|first=Matthew|date=December 7, 2002|work=WineSpectator.com|access-date=October 9, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is a [[godparent]] to ''[[Frasier]]'' co-star [[Jane Leeves]]' son, Finn, as was his late ''[[Frasier]]'' co-star [[John Mahoney]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/you/article-1354896/Jane-Leeves-Hot-Cleveland-struck-sitcom-gold-again.html|title='People are stopping me in the street again!': Actress Jane Leeves has struck sitcom gold again|publisher=Daily Mail|date=2011-02-13|accessdate=2011-03-20|first=Jane|last=Mulkerrins}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pierce has spent years working with the [[Alzheimer's Association]] on behalf of Americans with [[Alzheimer's disease]].  He has appeared in [[Washington, D.C.]], to testify in support of expanding funding for treatment, and he publicly campaigned for the National Alzheimer's Project Act. Pierce told [[MSNBC]] in 2011, "it is up to us, to all of us, to the American people and to their representatives about whether we face the challenges and make all the effort necessary or if we ignore it and just let this sort of tidal wave crash over us."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/44966598/ns/us_news-giving/#.Twu3g_nJYxQ |title=David Hyde Pierce: Don't forget Alzheimer's – US news – Giving &amp;#124; NBC News |publisher=MSNBC |date=2011-10-19 |accessdate=2014-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
