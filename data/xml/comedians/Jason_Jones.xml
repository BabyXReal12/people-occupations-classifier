'''Jason Pierre Jones'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allamericanspeakers.com/speakers/Jason-Jones/9743 |title=Jason Jones Biography |publisher=All American Speakers|accessdate=March 21, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marriage.about.com/od/entertainmen1/p/Samantha-Bee-And-Jason-Jones-Marriage-Profile.htm |title=Samantha Bee and Jason Jones Marriage Profile |publisher=About.com |accessdate=March 21, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (born June 3, 1973) is a Canadian-American actor and comedian. He was a [[List of The Daily Show correspondents|correspondent]] on ''[[The Daily Show|The Daily Show with Jon Stewart]]'' from 2005 to 2015. Since 2016, Jones has starred in the [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] comedy series ''[[The Detour (TV series)|The Detour]]'', which he created with his wife, [[Samantha Bee]].

==Life and career==
Jones was born and raised in [[Hamilton, Ontario]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macleans.ca/society/life/five-american-broadcast-personalities-you-might-not-know-are-canadian/ |title=Five American broadcast personalities who are Canadian |publisher=''Maclean's'' |date=December 21, 2012 |accessdate=March 21, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[Hill Park Secondary School]] and then [[Ryerson University|Ryerson]] Theatre School in [[Toronto]]. Jones is married to [[Samantha Bee]], the host of ''[[Full Frontal with Samantha Bee]]'' and fellow former ''[[The Daily Show]]'' correspondent, with whom he has three children: daughter Piper Bee-Jones (born 2006), son, Fletcher Bee-Jones (born 2008), and daughter, Ripley Bee-Jones (born 2010). In 2014, he became a United States citizen.&lt;ref&gt;Lisa de Moraes, [http://deadline.com/2014/10/jon-stewart-sick-jason-jones-daily-show-host-847884/ Jon Stewart sick - Jason Jones Daily Show Host] October 8, 2014. Retrieved October 9, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Daily Show with Jon Stewart''===
In September 2005, Jones joined ''The Daily Show'' cast as a contributor. When his wife left the show in late December for [[family leave]], Jones was promoted to a full-time correspondent. Thereafter, he won a significant following at ''The Daily Show'', thanks to a few pieces on the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|Denmark cartoons]], [[Carl Monday]], and [[Laguna Beach]]. Before [[Rob Corddry]] left ''The Daily Show'', he said: "Jason Jones has raised the bar too high. I just can't say the things he says to people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.phelpshawkins.com/2006.08.01_arch.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081212195707/http://www.phelpshawkins.com/2006.08.01_arch.html |archivedate=December 12, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; His exposé on the real values of [[Wasilla, Alaska]] remains one of the most popular pieces on the ''Daily Show'' website.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} In 2014, Jones temporarily left ''The Daily Show'' to appear in a pilot for the sitcom ''Love Is Relative''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2014/03/19/jason-jones-leaving-the-daily-show/|title=Jason Jones latest ‘Daily Show’ comedian moving to sitcoms|work=[[New York Post]]|date=March 19, 2014|accessdate=April 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2009, Jones was sent to Tehran just prior to the [[2009 Iranian election protests|controversial 2009 presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailyshow.com/video/index.jhtml?videoId=230115&amp;title=irandecision-2009-election&amp;byDate=true|title=The Daily Show with Trevor Noah|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/16/daily-show-sends-reporter-to-iran|work=The New York Times|title='Daily Show' Sends Reporter to Iran|first=Dave|last=Itzkoff|date=June 16, 2009|accessdate=May 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jones' reports in Iran included an interview with ''[[Newsweek]]'' journalist [[Maziar Bahari]], who was arrested after the disputed June 2009 presidential elections. During Bahari's time in prison, his interrogators charged him with espionage and used Jones' interview as evidence against him. It was later clarified by Bahari that the charges were fabricated.&lt;ref name="newsweek-118"&gt;{{cite web|title=Newsweek Reporter's Ordeal in Iran |author=Bahari, Maziar |url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/223862 |publisher=Newsweek |page=5 |accessdate=December 1, 2009 |archivedate=December 1, 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5lgsqODyd?url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/223862/page/5 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jones appeared as himself in the film version of Bahari's ordeal, ''[[Rosewater (film)|Rosewater]]'', encountering Bahari prior to taping their interview. The film was written and directed by ''[[The Daily Show|Daily Show]]'' host [[Jon Stewart]]. Another segment in Iran poked fun at Iranians' greater knowledge of the United States compared with Americans' knowledge of Iran. That segment, along with a 2011 piece in which he invited cameras to his [[vasectomy]], are regarded by ''[[TV Guide]]'' as his signature segments on the program.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolph, Ileane (July 27, 2015). "Alumni Association: A roundup of ''The Daily Show''{{'}}s coolest Graduates". ''[[TV Guide]]''. pp 21-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 7, 2014, he co-hosted ''The Daily Show'' with his wife [[Samantha Bee]], in the absence of [[Jon Stewart]]. He also disclosed on that episode that he had recently become an American citizen.

Jason Jones announced that he would leave ''The Daily Show'' in 2015 to begin work on ''[[The Detour (TV series)|The Detour]]'', a [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] show which he co-wrote and will executive produce with wife Samantha Bee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://deadline.com/2015/02/jason-jones-leaving-the-daily-show-1201380582/|author=Lisa de Moraes|title=Jason Jones Officially Leaving ‘Daily Show’, Samantha Bee Remains – Update|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=February 24, 2015|accessdate=March 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2014 Sochi Olympics====
Jones was sent as a mock reporter to cover the [[2014 Sochi Olympics]]. Through his visit, he often lampooned Russian culture and its perceived police state. For example, in one episode, Jones attempted to find a protest area in [[Sochi]] and was forced to drive well outside of the city to an abandoned parking lot which was designed as the zone for protesters; however, even then he was approached by police officers and asked to leave due to not having appropriate documentation.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} During his interview with opposition figure [[Alexei Navalny]], the crew's cameras and other electronic equipment was jammed as they entered an apartment to conduct the interview. Jones also managed to hold a mock interview with [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] where he insisted Gorbachev put up the wall, a play on president [[Ronald Reagan]]'s plea to Gorbachev to "[[tear down this wall!|tear down]]" the [[Berlin Wall]]. Alexei Navalny was arrested several days after conducting the interview with Jones, which was also satirized by [[Jon Stewart]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://thedailyshow.cc.com/videos/30gza6/jason-jones-live-from-sochi-ish---no-safety-nyet|title=Jason Jones Live From Sochi-ish - No Safety Nyet|publisher=[[The Daily Show]]|date=February 24, 2014|accessdate=September 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.takepart.com/article/2014/02/25/did-daily-show-really-catch-putins-spies-action|title=Did 'The Daily Show' Really Just Catch Putin's Spies in Action?|publisher=Take Part}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jones was able to interview [[Sergey Alexandrovich Markov|Sergey Markov]], a prominent Russian politician and academic. During the interview Jones questioned Markov about Russia's stance on [[gay rights]], to which Markov responded that there are no issues with gay rights in Russia and that "you are absolutely free to make sex with this table." The statement has since achieved notoriety with regards to Russia's stance on LGBT rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theweek.com/articles/450977/watch-daily-show-search-everywhere-straight-russian-who-backs-gay-rights|title=Watch The Daily Show search everywhere for a straight Russian who backs gay rights|publisher=The Week}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the program Jones also described Russia as a conservative paradise, noting the nation's relatively low flat tax, pro gun stance, opposition to gay marriage, and the powerful influence of the [[Orthodox church]]. He also remarked that Russia may be the "ultimate [[red state]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/the-daily-show-russia-sochi-conservatives-2014-2|title='The Daily Show' Has Discovered The Ultimate Unlikely Conservative 'Paradise' — Russia|publisher=Business Insider}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other work===
Jones has also done various television work with his Canadian [[sketch comedy]] troupe The Bobroom, and was the host of ''[[Craft Corner Deathmatch]]'' on the [[Style Network]] in 2005. He also co-wrote, co-starred in, and co-produced the 2004 film ''[[Ham &amp; Cheese]]'' with fellow Bobroom alumnus Mike Beaver; the film was nominated for six Canadian Comedy Awards in 2005. He has also had minor roles in numerous feature films, such as the 2002 [[Syfy]] original film ''[[Terminal Invasion]]'' and the 2003 film ''[[Public Domain (film)|Public Domain]]'', the latter of which also starred [[Don McKellar]], [[Nicole DeBoer]], and Beaver.

He appeared in the TV show ''[[Queer as Folk (U.S. TV series)|Queer as Folk]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biography of Jason Jones|website=AllAmericanSpeakers.com|year=2007|url=http://www.allamericanspeakers.com/speakers/Jason-Jones/9743
|accessdate=May 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as appearing on the [[CBS]] sitcom ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]'' as "Tony". Jones has appeared twice on the [[NBC]] series ''[[Law &amp; Order]]'' as Len Pewels, host of the fictional ''Len Pewels' America''. In 2008, Jones worked on a CBS sitcom about a celebrity chef (to be played by Jones), with his wife (to be played by [[Samantha Bee]]).&lt;ref&gt;''[[The New York Times]]'' "Sitcom Deals For 'Daily Show' Stars". October 21, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Jones and Bee starred as husband and wife in a movie entitled ''Cooper's Camera'' (USA ''Cooper's Christmas''), in which their Christmas was recorded on a brand new (1985, at the time) camera.

Jones did further work in a series of television advertisements, including a series for beer brand [[Molson]], and appearing as Greg Gregger in [[Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch)|Budweiser's]] short films ''The Best Man'' and ''The Company Man'', as well as in some 30-second commercials. Jones had a supporting role in the 2009 movie ''[[All About Steve]]''. In early 2010, he starred in a sitcom pilot for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] called ''How to be a Better American'', but it was not picked up as a series. He also made cameo appearances in the 2012 film ''[[Pitch Perfect]]'', its 2015 sequel ''[[Pitch Perfect 2]]'', the 2013 film ''[[The Art of the Steal (2013 film)|The Art of the Steal]]'' and the 2015 films ''Hot Tub Time Machine 2'' and ''[[The Night Before (2015 film)|The Night Before]]''. In 2014, Jones starred in the pilot for the sitcom ''Love is Relative'' as the character "Nate".

He worked with his wife, Samantha Bee, on development of a new show for [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]], ''[[The Detour (TV series)|The Detour]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Samantha Bee Talks About Making The Detours, Starring Jason Jones, a ‘Dirty Show’|url=http://www.vulture.com/2015/05/samantha-bee-on-her-new-tbs-show-the-detours.html|website=Vulture|accessdate=August 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; TBS ordered the [[television pilot|pilot]], written by Jason Jones and Samantha Bee in October 2014.&lt;ref name=presspilot&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2014/10/28/tbs-orders-comedy-pilot-from-jason-jones-and-samantha-bee-235413/20141028tbs01/|title=TBS Orders Comedy Pilot from Jason Jones &amp; Samantha Bee|publisher=[[The Futon Critic]]|date=October 28, 2014|author=TBS|accessdate= March 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show is based on the real life couple's own experience with family vacations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url= http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2015/03/05/samantha-bee-heading-to-tbs-former-daily-show-correspondent-signs-up-to-host-comedy-series-269210/20150305tbs01/ |title=Samantha Bee Heading to TBS - Former "Daily Show" Correspondent Signs Up to Host Comedy Series|publisher=[[The Futon Critic]]|date=March 5, 2015|author=TBS| accessdate= March 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was picked up for ten episodes in February 2015.&lt;ref name=pressorder&gt;{{cite press release|url= http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2015/02/24/tbs-greenlights-new-comedy-from-jason-jones-and-samantha-bee-799200/20150224tbs01/ |title=TBS Greenlights New Comedy from Jason Jones &amp; Samantha |publisher=[[The Futon Critic]] |date=February 24, 2015 |author=TBS | accessdate= March 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 6, 2016, the show was renewed for a second season, ahead of the first-season premiere the same month.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/the-detour-renewed-season-2-tbs-jason-jones-1201747278/|title=TBS Renews Jason Jones Comedy ‘The Detour’ For Season 2 Ahead of Series Debut|last=Wagmeister|first=Elizabeth|website=Variety|language=en-US|access-date=April 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second season premiered on February 21, 2017.
