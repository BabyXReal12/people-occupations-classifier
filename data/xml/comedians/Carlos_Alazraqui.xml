==Early life==
Carlos Jaime Alazraqui was born on July 20, 1962 in [[Yonkers, New York]]&lt;ref name=AlazraquiCSUS/&gt; to [[Argentine American|Argentine]] parents. He moved with his family to [[Concord, California]] at an early age. He attended college at [[California State University, Sacramento|California State University]], [[Sacramento, California]] from 1982-1986,&lt;ref name=AlazraquiCSUS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://37prime.com/news/2017/07/28/carlos-alazraqui-qa-birthplace-video/|title=Carlos Alazraqui Q&amp;A: Birthplace (Video)|date=December 2009|first=|last=|publisher=37prime.news|accessdate=July 28, 2017}}
*&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; "...then attended school, college in Sacramento after two years of junior college playing soccer and running track. I decided to do four years at Sacramento State from 82-86." — 00:58-01:08.&lt;/ref&gt; where he began competing in open mic contests. After winning in his 4th year of competing at the [[San Francisco International Comedy Competition]], Alazraqui took his prize money and moved to [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sanfranciscocomedycompetition.com/Pages/WholeCarlos.html|title=Carlos Alazraqui profile|publisher=Sanfranciscocomedycompetition.com|accessdate=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===Voice work===
Alazraqui has performed several voices for [[Nickelodeon]] cartoons, including [[Rocko (Rocko's Modern Life)|Rocko]] on ''[[Rocko's Modern Life]]'', as well as [[Denzel Q. Crocker]] and [[Juandissimo Magnifico]] on ''[[The Fairly OddParents]]'', Winslow T. Oddfellow and Lube on ''[[CatDog]]'', and Scooter on ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]''. He also voiced several additional voices for the Cartoon Network shows, ''[[Cow and Chicken]]'', ''KIDSCITY: The Village Dome of Kids'' and ''[[I Am Weasel]]'' during their runs in the mid-late 1990s. He also voiced Spyro in ''[[Spyro the Dragon (video game)|Spyro the Dragon]]''. He was later replaced by [[Tom Kenny]], who voiced Spyro in ''[[Spyro 2: Ripto's Rage!]]'', ''[[Spyro: Year of the Dragon]]'', and ''[[Spyro: Enter the Dragonfly]]''. He also voiced the [[Taco Bell chihuahua]] in the [[Taco Bell]] commercials,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = David| first = Long| title = Taco Bell Dog Story| url = http://www.everwonder.com/david/tacobell/story.html| postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[List of ¡Mucha Lucha! characters|Rikochet]] in the first two seasons of ''[[¡Mucha Lucha!]]'' and [[Mr. Weed]] (the head of the "Happy Go Lucky" toy factory) on ''[[Family Guy]]''. It is mentioned in the DVD commentary track that Alazraqui was reluctant to leave ''Family Guy''. In particular, [[Seth MacFarlane]] suggests that the death of Alazraqui's character Mr. Weed took the actor by surprise.

In 2005, he added the voices for two [[Cartoon Network]] series – ''[[The Life and Times of Juniper Lee]]'' where he played Monroe, a guardian dog with a [[Scottish English|Scottish accent]] and three characters in ''[[Camp Lazlo]]'': [[Lazlo (Camp Lazlo)|Lazlo]], Clam, and Chef McMuesli. In 2006, he added Salty Mike from ''[[Squirrel Boy]]'' and Walden in ''[[Wow! Wow! Wubbzy!]]'' on Nick, Jr. to his credits. He played Wisk in Glen Hill's 2000 film version of [[L. Frank Baum]]'s ''[[The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus]]''. He also provided the voice of Nestor in the ''[[Happy Feet]]'' fims.

Jeff "Swampy" Marsh, a storyboard writer for ''Rocko's Modern Life'', described Alazraqui's normal voice as bearing "no accent at all". Marsh describes Alazraqui's "Scottish accent" as "one of the best" and that he performs his other accents as "all very well". According to Marsh, Alazraqui uses various accents in his comedy routines.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.title14.com/rocko/contributors/interview.html Dan Abrams' interview with Jeff "Swampy" Marsh]", ''The Rocko's Modern Life FAQ''&lt;/ref&gt; He had worked for the [[Disney Channel]] on ''[[Handy Manny]]'', where he provided the voice for Felipe, the bilingual [[Phillips screwdriver|Phillips-head screwdriver]] and for Abuelito, Manny's grandfather. He was the original "voice guy" on the ''[[Stephanie Miller Show]]''. His replacement was [[Jim Ward (voice actor)|Jim Ward]], who had previously substituted for him. In January 2008, Alazraqui returned to fill in for Jim Ward briefly while he recovered from surgery. In 2014, he voiced Mesmo and Torts in ''[[Mixels]]''. He voices Tio Tortuga in ''[[Sheriff Callie's Wild West]]''.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

In addition, Alazraqui joined Miller's Sexy Liberal Comedy Tour in 2014, playing some of the dates with [[Jim Ward (voice actor)|Jim Ward]] and he has a semi-regular segment on Miller's radio show ''Coffee with Carlos''.

===Television===
Alazraqui is known for his live-action work in ''[[Reno 911!]]'', in which he portrayed Deputy James Garcia for five seasons (2003–08). He played the same role in the series' spinoff film ''[[Reno 911! Miami]]''. As a nod to this role, he also played a "bumbling" Reno cop in the ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation]]'' episode "[[Let it Bleed (CSI episode)|Let it Bleed]]". He has been a celebrity on the [[Tom Bergeron]] version of ''[[Hollywood Squares]]''.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

The series features [[Jill-Michele Meleán]], [[Debra Wilson]], [[Johnny A. Sanchez]], [[Lori Alan]], and [[Daran Norris]].

In 2013, Alazraqui starred as a drug dealer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=brand new episode up today starring Carlos Alazraqui!|url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/46624141/romantic-encounters-with-melinda-hill/posts/568623|accessdate=24 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in one episode of the Melinda Hill web series ''Romantic Encounters''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gutelle|first=Sam|title=Melinda Hill Seeking ‘Romantic Encounters’ On My Damn Channel Network|url=http://www.tubefilter.com/2013/06/26/romantic-encounters-my-damn-channel-comedy-network-melinda-hill/|publisher=Tubefilter|accessdate=24 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
