==Career==

===Comedy===
Lampanelli began her stand-up career in New York in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name="radar2005"&gt;{{cite web | last = Hyman | first = Peter | date = 2005-11-07 | title = Queen of Mean | url = http://www.radaronline.com/web-only/q-and-a/2005/11/queen-of-mean.php | publisher = [[Radar (magazine)|Radar]] Online | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070303085554/http://www.radaronline.com/web-only/q-and-a/2005/11/queen-of-mean.php | archivedate = 2007-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In explaining her reasons for switching from journalism to comedy, Lampanelli stated not only for the pay raise, but because "I get to say the [[nigger|n-word]] on stage and get paid money."&lt;ref name="huntnewsnu1"&gt;[http://huntnewsnu.com/2008/02/lisa-lampanelli-insults-her-way-through-nu/ Lisa Lampanelli insults her way through NU | The Huntington News].

Comedycentral.com.

Lampanelli released a comedy special on DVD entitled ''Take it Like A Man'' in 2005, appeared in the 2006 motion picture ''[[Larry the Cable Guy: Health Inspector]]'', and had a cameo appearance in the [[VH1]] sitcom ''[[So NoTORIous]]''. She also landed a deal with [[Fox Television Network|Fox]] for a sitcom pilot with the tentative title ''Big Loud Lisa'', which was considered a candidate for the network's 2006–07 television season.  Lampanelli taped her stand-up special ''Dirty Girl'' in the fall of 2006, which aired on Comedy Central on January 28, 2007.  Her ''Dirty Girl'' CD and ''Dirty Girl—No Protection'' DVD were released by Warner Bros./Jack Records on January 30, 2007.  Lampanelli was also featured in the movie ''[[Delta Farce]]'' starring [[Larry the Cable Guy]], [[Bill Engvall]], and [[D.J. Qualls]], which was released early in 2007, and in ''[[Drillbit Taylor]]'' starring [[Owen Wilson]].

Her style of humor was influenced most by the [[Dean Martin]] roasts that televised when she was growing up; she did not start watching other stand-up comedians until she became one herself.&lt;ref name=sdnn/&gt;&lt;ref name=punchline&gt;{{cite web |url=http://punchlinemagazine.com/lisa-lampanelli-highly-insulting/ |title=Lisa Lampanelli: Highly Insulting! |publisher= punchlinemagazine.com |accessdate=2010-10-17|date=2006-02-05 |author= Dylan P.

===''The Celebrity Apprentice 5''===

Lampanelli was a contestant on ''[[The Apprentice (U.S. season 12)|The Celebrity Apprentice 5]]'' (also known as ''The Apprentice 12''). She was criticized by viewers and had numerous outbursts and clashes with other contestants, including [[Victoria Gotti]], [[Arsenio Hall]], [[Lou Ferrigno]], and [[Dayana Mendoza]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/09/celebrity-apprentice--lisa-lampanelli-unloads-video_n_1411619.html 'Celebrity Apprentice': Lisa Lampanelli Unloads On Lou Ferrigno, Arsenio Hall And Dayana Mendoza (VIDEO)].

In spite of her behavior and relations with other contestants, she raised $130,000 for [[Gay Men's Health Crisis]] winning two out of three of the challenges she took on as Project Manager. Lampanelli was fired on May 6, 2012 during the Final Four interview because [[John Rich (musician)|John Rich]] and [[Marlee Matlin]] thought she was overly emotional.&lt;ref name="ross2012"&gt;Ross, Dalton (May 6, 2012).

==Books==
It Books ([[HarperCollins]]) is the publisher of Lampanelli's memoir, ''Chocolate, Please: My Adventures in Food, Fat, and Freaks'' (2009).  ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' reviewed:
{{quote|After more than 30 pages on her search for the "perfect black man," Lampanelli moves on to outline her standup career, from handling hecklers to doing ''[[The Tonight Show]]''... Seeking the roots of her humor, she recalls her childhood as an "attention whore": "Eating to get attention is a behavior that I continued into my high school days." She follows her memories of "fat rehab" with a variety of topics, from the [[Virgin Mary]] to [[vegan]]s. Much is quite funny, and Lampanelli never pulls her punches. Despite her raw language and raucous writing, honest reflections and stark self-insights emerge as she probes her past.&lt;ref&gt;''Publishers Weekly'', July 27, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Personal life==

Lampanelli married in 1991 and divorced soon after, though she and her former spouse remained friends.&lt;ref name=NYTimesWed/&gt; She married Jimmy Cannizzaro, a former tavern owner from [[Valley Stream, New York]], on October 2, 2010 at the [[New York Friars' Club]].&lt;ref name=NYTimesWed&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/17/fashion/weddings/17VOWS.html |title= Vows – Lisa Lampanelli and Jimmy Cannizzaro|work= [[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2010-10-17|author= Douglas Martin|date= 2010-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SanDiego.com&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.sandiego.com/comedy/interview-with-comedian-lisa-lampanelli|title= Interview With Comedian Lisa Lampanelli|publisher= [[SanDiego.com]]|accessdate= 2011-01-26|author= Gordon Downs|date= 2011-01-26|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110128060241/http://www.sandiego.com/comedy/interview-with-comedian-lisa-lampanelli|archivedate= 2011-01-28|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2014, she filed for divorce from Cannizzaro after four years of marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Boardman |first=Madeline |url=http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/lisa-lampanelli-files-for-divorce-from-husband-jimmy-cannizzaro-201415 |title=Lisa Lampanelli Files for Divorce from Husband Jimmy Cannizzaro |publisher=Usmagazine.com |date=2014-05-01 |accessdate=2014-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
