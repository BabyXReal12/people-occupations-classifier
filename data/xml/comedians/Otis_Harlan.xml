'''Otis Harlan''' (December 29, 1865 – January 21, 1940) was an American comedic actor.&lt;ref name="Hischak2011"/&gt;

==Biography==
Harlan was born in [[Zanesville, Ohio]] in 1865.&lt;ref name="Hischak2011"/&gt; He married Nellie Harvey and had a daughter named Marion. Harlan was the uncle of the [[silent film]] era [[leading man]], [[Kenneth Harlan]].&lt;ref name="Klepper1999"/&gt;

===Career===
In 1893, he appeared in [[Victor Herbert]]'s ''[[The Magic Knight]]''.  He was playing in vaudeville shows by 1911, appearing in [[Irving Berlin]]'s ragtime musicals. Harlan also played the role of Cap'n Andy in the first, [[part-talkie]] film version of  "[[Show Boat]]" (1929). He was also seen as the Master of Ceremonies in the sound prologue that accompanied the film. In 1935, Harlan played the role of Starveling in [[Max Reinhardt]]'s 1935 film version of [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''. In 1937, Harlan provided the voice of "Happy", one of the [[Seven Dwarfs]] in the Disney animated film ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]''.&lt;ref name="Hischak2011"/&gt; In the same year he also appeared in the ''[[Our Gang]]'' short ''[[Roamin' Holiday]]''.
