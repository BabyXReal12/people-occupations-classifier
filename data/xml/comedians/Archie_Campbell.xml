'''Archie Campbell''' (November 7, 1914 – August 29, 1987) was an American comedian, writer, and star of ''[[Hee Haw]]'', a [[Country music|country]]-flavored network television variety show. He was also a recording artist with several hits on the [[RCA]] label in the 1960s.

==Biography==

===Early career===
Campbell studied art at [[Mars Hill College]] in [[Mars Hill, North Carolina]], after which he began a radio career at [[WNOX]] in Knoxville. After a year alongside [[Roy Acuff]] on their ''Mid-Day Merry-Go-Round'', he relocated to [[WDOD (AM)|WDOD]] in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]], where he stayed until joining the [[United States Navy]] in 1941. At the end of [[World War II]], Campbell returned to WNOX. He left that station for rival [[WROL]] where he helped start Knoxville's first country music television show (on [[WATE-TV|WROL-TV]]), ''Country Playhouse'', that premiered in 1952 and ran until 1958.

At the close of that show, he moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] to replace [[Rod Brasfield]] on the nationally syndicated Prince Albert segment of the [[Grand Ole Opry]]. Shortly after, he signed a contract with [[RCA Victor]] and one of his early singles, "[[Trouble in the Amen Corner]]" reached the 1960 country music Top 25. After an unsuccessful stint with the [[Starday]] label, Campbell returned to RCA in 1966 and had three Top 30 singles: "The Men in My Little Girl's Life" (1966), "[[The Dark End of the Street]]" (1968), and "[[Tell It Like It Is (song)|Tell It Like It Is]]" (1968). He was named "Comedian of the Year" in 1969 by the [[Country Music Association]].

===Routines===
One of Campbell's 'signature' routines was to tell stories in "[[Spoonerism]]" form, with the first letters of words in some phrases intentionally switched for comic effect. The best-known of these stories was "RinderCella," his re-telling of the fairy tale "Cinderella," about the girl who "slopped her dripper" (dropped her slipper). Campbell once told the "RinderCella" story on an episode of the game show ''[[Juvenile Jury]].'' At the conclusion of the story, host [[Jack Barry (television personality)|Jack Barry]] said "That's one of the funniest stories Carchie Ampbell tells."  All of Campbell's spoonerism routines borrowed heavily from comedy routines performed by Colonel Stoopnagle on the radio show ''[[Stoopnagle and Budd]]'' in the 1930s. ("Colonel Stoopnagle" was the stage name of [[F. Chase Taylor]], 1897–1950.)

Campbell also performed a routine with various partners generally known as "That's Bad/That's Good."  Campbell would state a troublesome occurrence; when the partner would sympathize by saying, "Oh that's bad," Campbell would quickly counter, "No, that's good!", and then state a good result from the previous occurrence. When the partner would say, "Oh that's good!", Campbell would immediately counter with "No, that's bad!" and tell the new result, and so on.

===''Hee Haw''===
In 1969 Campbell joined ''Hee Haw'' on [[CBS-TV]] as a chief writer and on-air talent. His regular characterizations included the Barber, in which he performed his Spoonerism stories and his "That's Bad/That's Good" routines; the Doctor as "Doctor Campbell" with [[Gunilla Hutton]] as "Nurse Goodbody"; and, "Justus O'Peace," his version of the classic "Judge" routine of [[Pigmeat Markham]].  One of his most well-known segments was the "Where Oh Where" song ("PFFT! You Was Gone") in which he would perform a short verse of original comedy followed by the standard "Where oh where are you tonight" chorus which would conclude with him and a singing partner, often [[Gordie Tapp]], [[blowing a raspberry]] at one another or at the camera.

During his ''Hee Haw'' years Campbell also recorded several comedy-music albums such as ''Bull Session at Bull's Creek'' with [[Junior Samples]] and ''Archie Campbell'' ([[Elektra Records|Elektra]] 1976). He frequently performed duets with singer [[Lorene Mann]].

===Later life and death===
In 1984, Campbell hosted [[Spike TV|TNN]]'s ''Yesteryear'' interview show. Campbell was an accomplished amateur golfer and built one of the earliest lighted [[golf course]]s in the United States. An avid painter, he also owned an art gallery and served on the school board in Knoxville, where he lived until he suffered a fatal heart attack in 1987. He is buried near the town of [[Powell, Tennessee]].

==Legacy==
Campbell's childhood home on Main Street in [[Bull's Gap, Tennessee]] has been preserved as a memorial, and has been expanded into a "tourism complex and museum" which hosts annual "Archie Campbell Days" each September.

Following Campbell's death, [[U.S. Highway 11E (Tennessee)|U.S. Highway 11E]] through Bulls Gap was renamed "Archie Campbell Highway" in his memory.
