'''Michael Anthony Richards''' (born July 24, 1949) is an American actor, writer, television producer and comedian, widely known for his portrayal of [[Cosmo Kramer]] on the television sitcom ''[[Seinfeld]]'', for which he received the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series]] three times.

Richards began his career as a stand-up comedian, first entering the national spotlight when he was featured on [[Billy Crystal]]'s first cable TV special. He went on to become a series regular on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC's]] ''[[Fridays (TV series)|Fridays]]''. Prior to ''Seinfeld'', he made numerous guest appearances on a variety of television shows, such as ''[[Cheers]]''. His film credits include ''[[So I Married an Axe Murderer]]'', ''[[Airheads]]'', ''[[Young Doctors in Love]]'', ''[[Problem Child (1990 film)|Problem Child]]'', ''[[Coneheads (film)|Coneheads]]'', ''[[UHF (film)|UHF]]'', and ''[[Trial and Error (1997 film)|Trial and Error]]'', one of his few starring roles. During the run of ''Seinfeld'', he made a guest appearance in ''[[Mad About You]]''. After ''Seinfeld'', Richards starred in his own sitcom, ''[[The Michael Richards Show]]'', which lasted less than one full season.

When ''Seinfeld'' ended in 1998, Richards returned to stand-up comedy. He incited media furor while performing at the [[Laugh Factory]] comedy club in late 2006 after a cell phone video was published of him launching into an expletive-laced racial tirade after earlier interruptions from a group of late-arriving audience members.&lt;ref name="TMZ-2006"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tmz.com/2006/11/20/kramers-racist-tirade-caught-on-tape|title="Kramer's" Racist Tirade – Caught on Tape|accessdate=2006-11-20|publisher=TMZ.com|year=2006|author=TMZ Staff|work=In The Zone}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently due to significant media coverage of the event he announced his retirement from stand-up early in 2007. He appeared as himself in the [[Curb Your Enthusiasm Season 7|seventh season]] of ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'' in 2009, acting alongside his fellow cast members for the first time since ''Seinfeld''{{'}}s [[The Finale (Seinfeld)|finale]], as well as lampooning his incident at the Laugh Factory. In 2013, Richards returned to television when he played the role of Frank in the sitcom ''[[Kirstie (TV series)|Kirstie]]''.&lt;ref name=HollywoodReporter&gt;{{cite web | last = Goldberg | first = Lesely | date = February 15, 2013 | url = http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/tv-land-orders-kirstie-alley-421870|title=TV Land Orders Kirstie Alley-Michael Richards Comedy to Series| work = [[The Hollywood Reporter]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
[[File:Michael Richards HS Yearbook.jpeg|thumb|right|Richards as a senior at [[Thousand Oaks High School]], [[Thousand Oaks, California]] 1967]]

Richards was born in [[Culver City, California]], the son of Phyllis (née Nardozzi), a [[medical record]]s librarian, and William Richards, an [[Engineer's degree|electrical engineer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/97/Michael-Richards.html |title=Michael Richards Biography (1949?-) |publisher=Filmreference.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father died in a car crash when Michael was two and his mother never remarried.&lt;ref name="People"&gt;{{cite news |title = Michael Richards Tv's Top Jive-talking Hipster-doofus Fell for His Audience, and Vice Versa.

Richards graduated from [[Thousand Oaks High School]]. He was drafted into the [[United States Army]] in 1970. He trained as a medic and was stationed in [[West Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Barbara DeMarco Barrett|title=The Spaz at Home|publisher=Orange Coast Magazine|page=34|date=June 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being honorably discharged he used the benefits of the [[G.I. Bill]] to enroll in the [[California Institute of the Arts]], and received a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] degree in drama from [[The Evergreen State College]] in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=NewsLibrary&amp;p_multi=TNTB&amp;d_place=TNTB&amp;p_theme=newslibrary2&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0F11B7CD33E36831&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM | title=NewsLibrary.com – newspaper archive, clipping service – newspapers and other news sources | date=April 30, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also had a short-lived [[Improvisational comedy|improv]] act with [[Ed Begley, Jr.]]. During this period, he enrolled at [[Los Angeles Valley College]] and continued to appear in student productions.

== Career ==
Richards got his big TV break in 1979, appearing in [[Billy Crystal]]'s first cable TV special. In 1980, he began as one of the cast members on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC's]] ''[[Fridays (TV series)|Fridays]]'' television show, where [[Larry David]] was a writer. This included a famous instance in which guest [[Andy Kaufman]] refused to deliver his scripted lines, leading Richards to bring the [[cue card]]s on screen to Kaufman, causing him to throw his drink into Richards's face before a small riot ensued (Richards later claimed he was in on the joke).&lt;ref name="fac"&gt;[http://archive.firstamendmentcenter.org/about.aspx?id=12083 Michael Richards 'Speaking Freely' transcript] via [[First Amendment Center]], Recorded February 28, 2002, in Aspen, Colorado {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331131924/http://archive.firstamendmentcenter.org/about.aspx?id=12083 |date=March 31, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film ''[[Man on the Moon (film)|Man on the Moon]]'' featured a re-enactment of the [[Fridays (TV series)#Andy Kaufman incident|Andy Kaufman incident]] in which Richards was portrayed by actor [[Norm Macdonald]] (although he is never referred to by name so he could be seen as a composite character taking the place of Richards).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|url=http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/544255131b|title=Andy Kaufman on Fridays from FridaysFan|publisher=Funnyordie.com|date=February 11, 2008|accessdate=2010-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/michael-richards-2|title=Michael Richards – First Amendment Center – news, commentary, analysis on free speech, press, religion, assembly, petition|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, Richards had a supporting role in [["Weird Al" Yankovic]]'s comedy film ''[[UHF (film)|UHF]]'' as janitor Stanley Spadowski. On television, Richards also appeared in ''[[Miami Vice]]'' (as an unscrupulous [[bookie]]), ''[[Cheers]]'' (as a character trying to collect on an old bet with [[Sam Malone]]), and made several guest appearances with [[Jay Leno]] as an accident-prone fitness expert.

According to an interview with executive producer David Hoberman, ABC first conceived the series ''[[Monk (TV series)|Monk]]'' as a procedural police comedy with an [[Inspector Clouseau]]-like character suffering from [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]]. Hoberman said that ABC wanted Richards to play [[Adrian Monk]], but he turned it down.&lt;ref&gt;from "Mr Monk and His Origins," a special feature packaged with the Season One DVDs.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Seinfeld'' ===
[[File:Michael Richards Jerry Seinfeld.jpg|thumb|Richards with [[Jerry Seinfeld]] at the [[44th Primetime Emmy Awards]] in 1992]]

In 1989, he was cast as [[Cosmo Kramer]] in the [[NBC]] television series ''[[Seinfeld]]'', which was created by fellow ''Fridays'' cast member [[Larry David]] and comedian [[Jerry Seinfeld]]. Although it got off to a slow start, by the mid-1990s, the show had become one of the most popular [[Situation comedy|sitcoms]] in television history. The series ended its nine-year run in 1998 at #1 in the [[Nielsen ratings]]. In the setting of ''Seinfeld'', Kramer is usually referred to by his last name only and is the neighbor of the show's [[Jerry Seinfeld (character)|eponymous character]]. Kramer's first name, Cosmo, was revealed in the sixth-season episode "[[The Switch (Seinfeld)|The Switch]]".

Richards won more Emmys than any other cast member on ''Seinfeld''. He took home the award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series in 1993, 1994 and 1997.

Starting in 2004, he and his fellow ''Seinfeld'' cast members provided interviews and audio commentaries for the ''Seinfeld'' DVDs, but Richards stopped providing audio commentary after Season 5 though he continued to provide interviews.

=== ''The Michael Richards Show'' ===
In 2000, after the end of ''Seinfeld'', Richards began work on a new series for NBC, his first major project since ''Seinfeld''{{'}}s finale. ''[[The Michael Richards Show]]'', for which the actor received co-writer and co-[[Television producer|executive producer]] credits, was originally conceived as a comedy/mystery starring Richards as a bumbling private investigator. However, after the first pilot failed with test audiences, NBC ordered that the show be retooled into a more conventional, office-based sitcom before its premiere. After a few weeks of poor ratings and negative reviews, it was cancelled.

===2006 Laugh Factory incident ===
During a performance on November 17, 2006 at the [[Laugh Factory]] in [[Hollywood]], [[California]] Richards shouted a racially charged response to noise from black audience members, shouting "He's a [[nigger]]!" several times, and referring to [[lynching]], and the [[Jim Crow]] era.&lt;ref name="TMZ-2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vibe"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vibe.com/news/news_headlines/2006/11/comedian_michael_kramer_richards_goes_into_racial_tirade/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061231201005/http://www.vibe.com/news/news_headlines/2006/11/comedian_michael_kramer_richards_goes_into_racial_tirade/|archivedate=December 31, 2006|title=Comedian Michael "Kramer" Richards Goes into Racial Tirade, Banned From Laugh Factory|accessdate=2006-11-21|publisher=[[VIBE]].com|year=2006|author=Mariel Concepción|work=News wire}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/21/AR2006112100242.html |title="Seinfeld" Comic Richards Apologizes for Racial Rant |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date= November 21, 2006|accessdate=2010-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Canadian Broadcasting Corporation"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/richards-deeply-deeply-sorry-for-racial-slurs-1.618610|title=Richards 'deeply, deeply sorry' for racial slurs|accessdate=2006-11-20|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|work=CBC arts | date=November 20, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reuters-2006"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2006/11/20/us-richards-idUSN2041340020061120|title="Seinfeld" Star Richards Under Fire For Racial Outburst|accessdate=2013-06-28|publisher=Reuters|work=News wire|date=November 20, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- NOTE TO EDITORS: SEE REMARKS ABOVE THE PRECEDING PARAGRAPH ABOUT CONSENSUS ON THE LAUGH FACTORY INCIDENT, AS IN TALK ARCHIVE 2. CONSENSUS SECTION CONTINUES BELOW --&gt;Kyle Doss, a member of the group Richards addressed, said that the group had arrived in the middle of the performance, explaining:

{{Quote|text=[H]ere's what happened. As we walked in, we sat down and started ordering drinks. And, as we ordered drinks, I guess we're being a little loud, because there was 20 of us ordering drinks. And he said, "Look at the stupid Mexicans and blacks being loud up there." That's the first thing he said. And then he kept on with his bit. And, then, after a while, I told him, "My friend doesn't think you're funny." And then when I told him that, that's when he flipped me off and said, "F-you N-word." And that's how it all started.|sign=Kyle Doss|source=Interview on ''[[The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer|The Situation Room]]''&lt;ref name="CNN-transcripts"/&gt;}}&lt;!-- END OF CONSENSUS SECTION, WHICH COVERS THE LAUGH FACTORY INCIDENT. SEE TALK ARCHIVE 2. NEW DEVELOPMENTS SINCE FEBRUARY 2007 MAY BE ADDED AFTER HERE --&gt;

Richards made a public apology when he spoke via satellite on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'', when [[Jerry Seinfeld]] was the guest, saying, "For me to be at a comedy club and to flip out and say this crap, I'm deeply, deeply sorry. I'm not a racist, that's what's so insane about this."&lt;ref name="CNN-transcripts2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0611/21/cnr.01.html|title=CNN Newsroom|accessdate=2007-02-16|publisher=[[CNN]].com|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The audience initially laughed at Richards using the terms "Afromerican" and "Afro Americans" and during uncomfortable pauses in Richards' explanation and apology, unable to decide if the interview was a bit; at one point Seinfeld chided the audience, "Stop laughing, it's not funny." Richards said that he had been trying to defuse heckling by being even more outrageous, but that it had backfired. He later called civil rights leaders [[Al Sharpton]] and [[Jesse Jackson]] to apologize.&lt;ref name="CNN-transcripts"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0611/22/sitroom.03.html|title=''The Situation Room'' transcript|accessdate=2006-12-04|publisher=CNN|year=2006|work=[[The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer|The Situation Room]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN-article"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/SHOWBIZ/TV/11/22/sharpton.richard/index.html|title= Sharpton: Comedian's apology not enough|accessdate=2007-04-22|work=[[CNN]] |date=November 23, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also appeared as a guest on Jackson's syndicated radio show.&lt;ref name="CBS-2007"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/11/25/entertainment/main2208718.shtml?source=RSSattr=U.S._2208718|title=Jesse Jackson Talks To Michael Richards: Jackson Says Apology For Actor's Racist Rant Is Only A Beginning Before Healing|accessdate=2007-04-23|publisher=CBS|work=News wire | date=November 25, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; However both Doss and Sharpton have refused to accept Richards' apology, with the former saying "...if he wanted to apologize, he could have contacted somebody to one of us from the group...but he didn't. He apologized on camera just because the tape got out."&lt;ref name="CNN-article"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VFGv0mdckM Kyle Doss wants reparations for Kramer calling him a nigger] at YouTube&lt;/ref&gt;

The incident was later [[parody|parodied]] on several TV shows, including ''[[MadTV]]'', ''[[Family Guy]]'', ''[[With Apologies to Jesse Jackson|South Park]]'', and ''[[Extras (TV series)#US and UK version differences|Extras]]''. In an episode of ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'', Richards appeared as himself and poked fun at the incident. In a 2012 episode of Seinfeld's web series ''[[Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee]]'', Richards admitted that the outburst still haunted him, and was a major reason for his withdrawal from performing stand-up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://comediansincarsgettingcoffee.com/michael-richards-its-bubbly-time-jerry |title=Michael Richards It's Bubbly Time, Jerry – Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee by Jerry Seinfeld |publisher=Comediansincarsgettingcoffee.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140511134913/http://comediansincarsgettingcoffee.com/michael-richards-its-bubbly-time-jerry/ |archivedate=May 11, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richards played radio station employee Doug Beech in ''[[Airheads]]'' and co-starred with [[Jeff Daniels]] as an actor pretending to be a lawyer in 1997's ''[[Trial and Error (1997 film)|Trial and Error]]''.
