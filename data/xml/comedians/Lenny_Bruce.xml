'''Leonard Alfred Schneider''' (October 13, 1925 – August 3, 1966), better known by his stage name '''Lenny Bruce''', was an American stand-up comedian, social critic, and satirist. He was renowned for his open, free-style and critical form of comedy which integrated satire, politics, religion, sex, and vulgarity. His 1964 conviction in an [[obscenity]] trial was followed by a [[Posthumous recognition|posthumous]] pardon, the first in the history of New York state, by then-Governor [[George Pataki]] in 2003.

Bruce is renowned for paving the way for future outspoken [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture-era]] comedians, and his trial for obscenity is seen as a landmark for [[freedom of speech in the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nndb.com/people/406/000022340/ |title=Lenny Bruce |work=nndb.com |year=2012 |accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/24/nyregion/no-joke-37-years-after-death-lenny-bruce-receives-pardon.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm |title=No Joke! 37 Years After Death Lenny Bruce Receives Pardon - New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=2003-12-24 |accessdate=2013-12-05 |first1=John |last1=Kifner}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/1013.html |title=Lenny Bruce, Uninhibited Comic, Found Dead in Hollywood Home |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=1966-08-04 |accessdate=2013-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/24/arts/24carlin.html?pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | first1=Mel | last1=Watkins | first2=Bruce | last2=Weber | title=George Carlin, Comic Who Chafed at Society and Its Constraints, Dies at 71 | date=2008-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2017, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine ranked him third (behind disciples [[Richard Pryor]] and [[George Carlin]]) on its list of the 50 best stand-up comics of all-time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/lists/50-best-stand-up-comics-of-all-time-w464199 The 50 Best Stand-up Comics of All Time]. Rollingstone.com, retrieved February 15, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Lenny Bruce was born Leonard Alfred Schneider to a Jewish family in Mineola, New York, grew up in nearby [[Bellmore, New York|Bellmore]], and attended [[Wellington C. Mepham High School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?ei=MCd3T4jdLMqi0QXA4cS1DQ&amp;id=Ly8IAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=lenny+bruce+Wellington+C.+Mepham+High+School&amp;q=Wellington+C.+Mepham+#search_anchor |title=Ladies and Gentlemen: Lenny Bruce!! |page=107 |author1=Albert Goldman |author2=Lawrence Schiller |publisher=Penguin Books |year= 1991 |accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents divorced when he was five years old (the documentary ''[[Lenny Bruce: Swear to Tell the Truth]]'' claims he was eight years old), and Lenny lived with various relatives over the next decade. His British-born father, Myron (Mickey) Schneider, was a shoe clerk and Lenny saw him very infrequently. Bruce's mother, [[Sally Marr]] (real name Sadie Schneider, born Sadie Kitchenberg), was a stage performer and had an enormous influence on Bruce's career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?ei=hiZ3T7WOJ-rE0QX2hKj0Bw&amp;id=i3ZcAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Lenny+Bruce%3A+the+making+of+a+prophet&amp;q=Sally+Marr#search_anchor |title=Lenny Bruce: the making of a prophet|page=47 |first=William Karl |last= Thomas |publisher=Archon Books |date= 1 Dec 1989 |accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After spending time working on a farm, Bruce joined the [[United States Navy]] at the age of 16 in 1942, and saw active duty during [[World War II]] aboard the {{USS|Brooklyn|CL-40}} fighting in Northern Africa; [[Palermo]], [[Italy]], in 1943; and [[Operation Shingle|Anzio]], Italy, in 1944. In May 1945, after a comedic performance for his shipmates in which he was dressed in [[Drag (clothing)|drag]], his commanding officers became upset. He defiantly convinced his ship's medical officer that he was experiencing homosexual urges.&lt;ref&gt;A.H. Goldman. ''Ladies and Gentlemen: Lenny Bruce!!'' (New York: Random House, 1971), p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; This led to his undesirable discharge in July 1945. However, he had not admitted to or been found guilty of any breach of naval regulations and successfully applied to have his discharge changed to [[honorable discharge|"Under Honorable Conditions ... by reason of unsuitability for the naval service"]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesmokinggun.com/file/lenny-bruce-navy-records?page=10 "Lenny Bruce's Gay Naval Ruse: Unearthed documents detail comedian's discharge"], [[TheSmokingGun.com]], August 31, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959, while taping the first episode of [[Hugh Hefner]]'s ''[[Playboy's Penthouse]]'', Bruce talked about his Navy experience and showed a tattoo he received in [[Malta]] in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0675481/?ref_=fn_al_tt_5|title="Playboy's Penthouse" Episode #1.1 (TV Episode 1959)|publisher=|accessdate=19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a short stint in [[California]] spent living with his father, Bruce settled in [[New York City]], hoping to establish himself as a comedian. However, he found it difficult to differentiate himself from the thousands of other show business hopefuls who populated the city. One locale where they congregated was Hanson's, the diner where Bruce first met the comedian [[Joe Ancis]],&lt;ref name="Joe Acis: A Brief Biography"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Driven|first1=Joey|title=Joe Acis: A Brief Biography|url=http://www.reverbnation.com/page_object/page_object_blogs/artist_893835|accessdate=28 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; who had a profound influence on his approach to comedy. Many of Bruce's later routines reflected his meticulous schooling at the hands of Ancis.&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bruce's biographer [[Albert Goldman]], Ancis' humor involved stream-of-consciousness sexual fantasies and references to jazz.&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, p. 105-108.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lenny took the stage as "Lenny Marsalle" one evening at the Victory Club, as a stand-in master of ceremonies for one of his mother's shows. His ad-libs earned him some laughs. Soon afterward, in 1947, just after changing his last name to Bruce, he earned $12 and a free spaghetti dinner for his first stand-up performance in [[Brooklyn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lenny Bruce|url=http://www.reference.com/browse/lenny+bruce|website=Reference.com|accessdate=28 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402092400/http://www.reference.com/browse/lenny+bruce|archive-date=2 April 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was later a guest—and was introduced by his mother, who called herself "Sally Bruce"—on the ''[[Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts]]'' radio program. Lenny did a bit inspired by [[Sid Caesar]], "The [[Bavaria]]n Mimic", featuring impressions of American movie stars (e.g., [[Humphrey Bogart]], [[James Cagney]], and [[Edward G. Robinson]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schwartz|first1=Ben|title=The Comedy Behind the Tragedy|url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/the-comedy-behind-the-tragedy/Content?oid=917393|website=Chicago Reader|accessdate=28 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Bruce's early comedy career included writing the screenplays for ''[[Dance Hall Racket]]'' in 1953, which featured Bruce, his wife Honey Harlow, and mother Sally Marr in roles; ''[[Dream Follies]]'' in 1954, a low-budget [[American burlesque|burlesque]] romp; and a children's film, ''[[The Rocket Man (1954 film)|The Rocket Man]]'', in 1954. In 1956 [[Frank Ray Perilli]], a fellow nightclub comedian who eventually became a screenwriter of two dozen successful films and plays, became a mentor and part-time manager of Lenny Bruce.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediamaestro.net/candybutcher.htm The Candy Butcher (2016)] p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; Through Perilli, Bruce met and collaborated with photojournalist William Karl Thomas on three screenplays (''Leather Jacket'', ''Killer's Grave'' and ''The Degenerate''), none of which made it to the screen, and the comedy material on the first three albums.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediamaestro.net/prophet.htm Lenny Bruce: The Making of a Prophet (1989)]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, p. 54-63.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1957 Thomas booked Bruce into The Slate Brothers nightclub, where Bruce was fired the first night for what ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' headlined as "blue material"; this led to the theme of Bruce's first solo album on [[Fantasy Records]], ''The Sick Humor of Lenny Bruce'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediamaestro.net/prophet.htm Lenny Bruce: The Making of a Prophet (1989)]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} p. 276-229.&lt;/ref&gt; for which Thomas shot the album cover. Thomas also shot other album covers, acted as cinematographer on abortive attempts to film their screenplays, and in 1989 authored a memoir of their ten-year collaboration titled ''Lenny Bruce: The Making of a Prophet''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediamaestro.net/lenny.htm|title=Lenny Bruce: The Making of a Prophet|first=meta tags by William Karl Thomas; web design by William Karl|last=Thomas|website=www.mediamaestro.net|accessdate=19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2016 biography of Frank Ray Perilli titled ''The Candy Butcher'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediamaestro.net/candybutcher.htm|title=The Candy Butcher (2016)|publisher=|accessdate=19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; devotes a chapter to Perilli's ten-year collaboration with Bruce.

Bruce released a total of four albums of original material on Berkeley-based Fantasy Records, with rants, comic routines, and satirical interviews on the themes that made him famous: [[jazz]], [[moral philosophy]], [[politics]], [[patriotism]], religion, [[law]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[abortion]], [[psychoactive drug|drugs]], the [[Ku Klux Klan]], and [[Jewishness]]. These albums were later compiled and re-released as ''The Lenny Bruce Originals''. Two later records were produced and sold by Bruce himself, including a 10-inch album of the 1961 San Francisco performances that started his legal troubles. Starting in the late 1950s, other unissued Bruce material was released by [[Alan Douglas (record producer)|Alan Douglas]], [[Frank Zappa]] and [[Phil Spector]], as well as Fantasy. Bruce developed the complexity and tone of his material in [[Enrico Banducci]]'s [[North Beach, San Francisco|North Beach]] nightclub, the "[[hungry i]]", where [[Mort Sahl]] had earlier made a name for himself.

Branded a "sick comic"—though it was the perceived "sickness" of modern society that he was railing about—Bruce was essentially blacklisted from television, and when he did appear thanks to sympathetic fans like [[Steve Allen]] or Hugh Hefner, it was with great concessions to [[Broadcast Standards and Practices (US)|Broadcast Standards and Practices]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Museum of Television &amp; Radio Presents Two Five-Letter Words: Lenny Bruce|url=http://www.paleycenter.org/pressrelease-2004-lenny-bruce|website=The Paley Center for Media|accessdate=28 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jokes that might offend, like a bit on airplane [[inhalant|glue-sniffing]] teenagers that was done live for ''[[The Steve Allen Show]]'' in 1959, had to be typed out and pre-approved by network officials.

His growing fame led to appearances on the nationally televised ''Steve Allen Show'', where he made his debut with an unscripted comment on the recent marriage of [[Elizabeth Taylor]] to [[Eddie Fisher (singer)|Eddie Fisher]], wondering, "will Elizabeth Taylor become [[bar and bat mitzvah|bar mitzvahed]]?"&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=oCplnUga0hU?t=1m45s|title=Lenny Bruce}}&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;!--San Francisco columnist [[Herb Caen]], however, was an early and enthusiastic supporter, writing in 1959:
&lt;blockquote&gt;They call Lenny Bruce a [[sick comic]], and sick he is. Sick of all the pretentious phoniness of a generation that makes his vicious humor meaningful. He is a rebel, but not without a cause, for there are shirts that need un-stuffing, egos that need deflating. Sometimes you feel guilty laughing at some of Lenny's mordant jabs, but that disappears a second later when your inner voice tells you with pleased surprise, 'but that's true.'&lt;/blockquote&gt;
--&gt;
On February 3, 1961, in the midst of a severe blizzard, he gave a famous performance at [[Carnegie Hall]] in New York. It was recorded and later released as a three-disc set, titled ''The Carnegie Hall Concert''.{{full citation needed|date=June 2016}} In the liner notes, Albert Goldman described it as follows:{{cite quote|date=June 2016}}

{{quote|This was the moment that an obscure yet rapidly rising young comedian named Lenny Bruce chose to give one of the greatest performances of his career. ... The performance contained in this album is that of a child of the jazz age. Lenny worshiped the gods of Spontaneity, Candor and [[Free association (psychology)|Free Association]]. He fancied himself an oral jazzman. His ideal was to walk out there like [[Charlie Parker]], take that mike in his hand like a horn and blow, blow, blow everything that came into his head just as it came into his head with nothing censored, nothing translated, nothing mediated, until he was pure mind, pure head sending out brainwaves like radio waves into the heads of every man and woman seated in that vast hall. Sending, sending, sending, he would finally reach a point of [[clairvoyance]] where he was no longer a performer but rather a medium transmitting messages that just came to him from out there — from recall, fantasy, prophecy.

A point at which, like the practitioners of [[automatic writing]], his tongue would outrun his mind and he would be saying things he didn't plan to say, things that surprised, delighted him, cracked him up — as if he were a spectator at his own performance!}}

==Personal life==
In 1951, Bruce met [[Honey Harlow]], a [[stripper]] from [[Manila, Arkansas]]. They were married that same year, and Bruce was determined she end her work as a stripper.&lt;ref&gt;Kottler, Jeffrey A., ''Divine Madness: Ten Stories of Creative Struggle'' (San Francisco: Jossey-Bass, 2006), 221.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bruce and Harlow eventually left New York City in 1953 for the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], where they got work as a double act at the Cup and Saucer in Los Angeles, California. Bruce then went on to join the bill at the club Strip City. Harlow found employment at the Colony Club, which was widely known to be the best burlesque club in Los Angeles at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bruce left Strip City in late 1954 and found work within the [[San Fernando Valley]] at a variety of strip clubs. As the master of ceremonies, he introduced the strippers while performing his own ever-evolving material. The clubs of the Valley provided the perfect environment for Bruce to create new routines: According to Bruce's primary biographer, Albert Goldman, it was "precisely at the moment when he sank to the bottom of the barrel and started working the places that were the lowest of the low" that he suddenly broke free of "all the restraints and inhibitions and disabilities that formerly had kept him just mediocre and began to blow with a spontaneous freedom and resourcefulness that resembled the style and inspiration of his new friends and admirers, the jazz musicians of the modernist school."&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

Honey and Lenny's daughter Kitty Bruce was born in 1955.&lt;ref name="Ofiicial Lenny Bruce site"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chronology – The 50s|url=http://www.lennybruceofficial.com/the-life-of-lenny-bruce/chronology-the-50s/|work=The Official Lenny Bruce Site|publisher=Mystic Liquid|accessdate=28 November 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111113122849/http://www.lennybruceofficial.com/the-life-of-lenny-bruce/chronology-the-50s/|archive-date=13 November 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He had an affair with the jazz singer [[Annie Ross]] in the late 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/03/movies/pop-music-a-free-spirited-survivor-lands-on-her-feet.html?pagewanted=all|title=A Free-Spirited Survivor Lands on Her Feet|publisher=The New York Times|date=3 October 1993|first=James|last=Gavin|accessdate=12 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959, Lenny's divorce from Honey was finalized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lenny Bruce|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/406/000022340/|work=NNDB|accessdate=28 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal troubles==

Bruce's desire to end his wife's stripper days led him to pursue schemes that were designed to make as much money as possible. The most notable was the Brother Mathias Foundation scam, which resulted in Bruce's arrest in [[Miami]], [[Florida]] in 1951 for impersonating a [[priest]]. He had been soliciting donations for a [[leprosy|leper]] colony in [[British Guiana]] (now [[Guyana]]) under the auspices of the "Brother Mathias Foundation", which he had legally chartered – the name was his own invention, but possibly referred to the actual Brother Matthias who had befriended [[Babe Ruth]] at the Baltimore orphanage to which Ruth had been confined as a child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chatterfromthedugout.com/babe_and_brother_matthias.htm |title=Babe Ruth and Brother Matthias |publisher=Chatterfromthedugout.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bruce had stolen several priests' clergy shirts and a clerical collar while posing as a laundry man. He was found not guilty because of the legality of the New York state-chartered foundation, the actual existence of the Guiana [[leper colony]], and the inability of the local clergy to expose him as an impostor. Later, in his semifictional autobiography ''[[How to Talk Dirty and Influence People]]'', Bruce revealed that he had made about $8,000 in three weeks, sending $2,500 to the leper colony and keeping the rest.

===Obscenity arrests===
On October 4, 1961, Bruce was arrested for obscenity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freenetpages.co.uk/hp/lennybruce/chronology.htm#1961|title=Lenny Bruce – Chronology|access-date=2007-06-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070613155335/http://www.freenetpages.co.uk/hp/lennybruce/chronology.htm#1961|archive-date=2007-06-13|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Jazz Workshop]] in [[San Francisco]]; he had used the word ''[[wikt:cocksucker|cocksucker]]'' and riffed that "''to'' is a [[preposition]], ''come'' is a [[verb]]", that the sexual context of ''[[orgasm|come]]'' is so common that it bears no weight, and that if someone hearing it becomes upset, he "probably can't come".&lt;ref name=UMKC&gt;{{cite web|last=Bruce|first=Lenny|title=To is a Preposition, Come is a Verb|work=The Trials of Lenny Bruce|publisher=University of Missouri-Kansas City}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the jury acquitted him, other law enforcement agencies began monitoring his appearances, resulting in frequent arrests under charges of obscenity.

Bruce was arrested again in 1961, in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], for [[drug possession]] and again in Los Angeles,  two years later. The Los Angeles arrest took place in then-unincorporated [[West Hollywood]], and the arresting officer was a young deputy named [[Sherman Block]], who later became County Sheriff. The specification this time was that the comedian had used the word ''[[Schmuck (pejorative)|schmuck]]'', an insulting [[Yiddish]] term that is an obscene term for penis. The Hollywood charges were later dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;Gross, David C.

In April 1964, he appeared twice at the [[Cafe Au Go Go]] in [[Greenwich Village]], with undercover police detectives in the audience. He was arrested along with the club owners, Howard and Elly Solomon, who were arrested for allowing an obscene performance to take place. On both occasions, he was arrested after leaving the stage, the complaints again pertaining to his use of various obscenities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Linder|first1=Doug|title=The Trials of Lenny Bruce|url=http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/bruce/bruceaccount.html|website=Famous Trials: The Lenny Bruce Trial 1964|accessdate=28 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A three-judge panel presided over his widely publicized six-month trial, prosecuted by Manhattan Assistant D.A. [[Richard Kuh]], with [[Ephraim London]] and Martin Garbus as the defense attorneys. Bruce and club owner Howard Solomon were both found guilty of obscenity on November 4, 1964. The conviction was announced despite positive testimony and petitions of support from – among other artists, writers and educators – [[Woody Allen]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Jules Feiffer]], [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[Norman Mailer]], [[William Styron]], and [[James Baldwin]], and Manhattan journalist and television personality [[Dorothy Kilgallen]] and [[sociology|sociologist]] [[Herbert Gans]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/bruce/brucetrial.html Excerpts from the Lenny Bruce Trial (Cafe Au Go Go)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100628084404/http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/bruce/brucetrial.html |date=2010-06-28 }}.

==Later years==
[[File:Lenny Bruce at the Fillmore.jpg|thumb|Poster for Bruce's last series of performances, which took place at [[The Fillmore]] in San Francisco on June 24 and 25, 1966.]]

Despite his prominence as a comedian, Bruce appeared on network television only six times in his life.&lt;ref name=paley&gt;{{cite web|title=The Museum of Television &amp; Radio Presents Two Five-Letter Words: Lenny Bruce|url=http://www.paleycenter.org/pressrelease-2004-lenny-bruce|website=[[The Paley Center for Media]]|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his later club performances, Bruce was known for relating the details of his encounters with the police directly in his comedy routine. These performances often included rants about his court battles over obscenity charges, tirades against [[fascism]] and complaints that he was being denied his right to [[freedom of speech]].

Bruce was banned outright from several U.S. cities, and in September 1962, his only visit to Australia caused a media storm - although, contrary to popular belief, he was not banned, nor was he forced to leave the country. Bruce was booked for a two-week engagement at Aaron's Exchange Hotel, a small pub in central [[Sydney, New South Wales]] by the American-born, Australian-based promoter [[Lee Gordon (promoter)|Lee Gordon]], who was by then deeply in debt, nearing the end of his formerly successful career, and desperate to save his business.

Bruce's first show at 9pm on 6 September was uneventful, but his second show at 11pm led to a major public controversy. Bruce was heckled by audience members during his performance, and when local actress, Barbara Wyndon, stood up and complained that Bruce was only talking about America, and asked him to talk about something different, a clearly annoyed Bruce responded "Fuck you, madam. That's different, isn't it?" His remark shocked some members of the audience and several walked out. By the next day the local press had blown the incident up into a major controversy, with several Sydney papers denouncing Bruce as "sick" and one even illustrating their story with a retouched photograph appearing to show Bruce giving a fascist salute. The venue owners immediately cancelled the rest of Bruce's performances, and he retreated to his Kings Cross hotel room. Local university students (including future [[Oz magazine]] editor [[Richard Neville (writer)|Richard Neville]]) who were fans of Bruce's humour tried to arrange a performance at the Roundhouse at the [[University of New South Wales]], but at the last minute the university's Vice-Chancellor rescinded permission to use the venue, with no reason given.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Neville, ''Hippie Hippie Shake'' (William Heinemann Australia, 1995, ISBN 085615230), pp. 21-22.&lt;/ref&gt; and an interview he was scheduled to give on Australian television was cancelled in advance by the [[Australian Broadcasting Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, p. 372.&lt;/ref&gt; Bruce remained largely confined to his hotel, but eight days later Bruce gave his third and last Australian concert at the [[Wintergarden Theatre]] in Sydney's eastern suburbs. Although the theatre had a capacity of 2100, only 200 people attended, including a strong police presence, and in the event Bruce gave what was described as a "subdued" performance. It was long rumoured that a [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC05aUlFXOE|tape recording] of Bruce's historic performance was made by police, but it was in fact recorded by a local jazz saxophonist, Sid Powell, who brought a portable tape recorder to the show. The tape was rediscovered in 2011 in the possession of Australian singer [[Sammy Gaha]], who had acted as Bruce's chauffeur during his visit, and it was subsequently donated to the Lenny Bruce audio collection at [[Brandeis University]]. Bruce left the country a few days later and spoke little about the experience afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.revolve.com.au/pdfs/lennybruce.pdf|title= Derek Strahan, "When I opened for Lenny Bruce in Australia", revolve.com, (accessed 2017-05-22)|publisher=|accessdate=19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionaryofsydney.org/entry/lenny_bruces_visit_to_sydney_1962|title=Lenny Bruce's visit to Sydney 1962|website=dictionaryofsydney.org|accessdate=19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://michaeladamswrites.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/lenny-bruce.pdf|title=MIchael Adams, "When Lenny Met Sydney", michaeladamswrites wordpress site (accessed 2017-05-22)|publisher=|accessdate=19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/booksandarts/lenny-bruce-and-his-ill-fated-sydney-tour/4636758|title=Lenny Bruce and his ill-fated Sydney tour|date=18 April 2013|publisher=|accessdate=19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Increasing drug use also affected his health. By 1966, he had been [[blacklist]]ed by nearly every nightclub in the United States, as owners feared prosecution for obscenity. Bruce gave a famous performance at the [[Berkeley Community Theatre]] in December 1965. It was recorded and became his last live album, titled ''The Berkeley Concert''; his performance here has been described as lucid, clear and calm, and one of his best. His last performance took place on June 25, 1966, at The Fillmore Auditorium in San Francisco, on a bill with Frank Zappa and [[The Mothers of Invention]].&lt;ref name="graham"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wnZ0qL3QdkgC&amp;pg=PA159&amp;dq=Lenny+Bruce+fillmore+%22whacked+out+on+amphetamines&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=68xrVLj3IImzyQTJuYHAAw&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22whacked%20out%20on%20amphetamines%22&amp;f=false | title=Bill Graham Presents: My Life Inside Rock and Out | publisher=Da Capo Press | date=2004 | accessdate=18 November 2014 |author1=Graham, Bill | author1link = Bill Graham (promoter)|author2=Greenfield, Robert| author2link =Robert Greenfield| pages=156 | isbn=978-0306813498}}&lt;/ref&gt; The performance was not remembered fondly by [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]], whose memoir describes Bruce as "whacked out on [[amphetamines|amphetamine]]";&lt;ref&gt;Graham, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; Graham thought that Bruce finished his set emotionally disturbed. Zappa asked Bruce to sign his [[draft card]], but the suspicious Bruce refused.&lt;ref name="zappa"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FB0O_HCpBy0C&amp;pg=PA69&amp;dq=Zappa+asked+lenny+bruce+to+sign+his+draft+card&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7CdsVKixN8OBygS5-IDYCw&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Zappa%20asked%20lenny%20bruce%20to%20sign%20his%20draft%20card&amp;f=false | title=The Real Frank Zappa Book | publisher=Simon and Schuster |author1=Zappa, Frank |author2=Occhiogrosso, Peter | year=1989 | pages=69 | isbn=9780671705725}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the request of Hugh Hefner and with the aid of [[Paul Krassner]], Bruce wrote an autobiography. Serialized in ''[[Playboy]]'' in 1964 and 1965, this material was later published as the book ''How to Talk Dirty and Influence People''.&lt;ref name=watts&gt;{{cite book|last1=Watts|first1=Steven|title=Mr Playboy: Hugh Hefner and the American Dream|date=2009|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9780470501375|page=190|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m5b_eM3twmEC&amp;pg=PA190&amp;dq=how+to+talk+dirty+and+influence+people+lenny+bruce+hefner+serialized+in+playboy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=dx1tVMbEL82AygSdwIL4Cw&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=how%20to%20talk%20dirty%20and%20influence%20people%20lenny%20bruce%20hefner%20serialized%20in%20playboy&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hefner had long assisted Bruce's career, featuring him in the television debut of ''[[Playboy's Penthouse]]'' in October 1959.

During this time, Bruce also contributed a number of articles to Paul Krassner's satirical magazine ''[[The Realist]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Realist Archive Project|url=http://www.ep.tc/realist/index.html}} Issues 15, 41, 48, 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and posthumous pardon==
[[File:LennyBruce Grave.JPG|thumb|Bruce's grave at [[Eden Memorial Park Cemetery]] in [[Mission Hills, California]]]]
On August 3, 1966, a bearded Lenny Bruce was found dead in the bathroom of his [[Hollywood Hills]] home at 8825 W. Hollywood Blvd.&lt;ref name=Obituary&gt;{{cite news|last=AP|title=Obituary|url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/1013.html|accessdate=28 November 2011|newspaper=New York Times|date=August 4, 1966}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The official photo, taken at the scene, showed Bruce lying naked on the floor, a syringe and burned bottle cap nearby, along with various other [[narcotic]]s paraphernalia. Record producer [[Phil Spector]], a friend of Bruce, bought the negatives of the photographs "to keep them from the press". The official cause of death was "acute [[morphine]] poisoning caused by an overdose."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Trials of Lenny Bruce: The Fall and Rise of an American Icon|last1=Collins|first1=Ronald|last2=Skover |first2=David|year=2002|publisher=Sourcebooks Mediafusion|isbn=1-57071-986-1|page=340}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His remains were interred in [[Eden Memorial Park Cemetery]] in [[Mission Hills, California]], but an unconventional memorial on August 21 was controversial enough to keep his name in the spotlight. The service saw over 500 people pay their respects, led by Spector. Cemetery officials had tried to block the ceremony after advertisements for the event encouraged attendees to bring box lunches and noisemakers. [[Dick Schaap]] eulogized Bruce in ''Playboy'', with the memorable last line: "One last four-letter word for Lenny: Dead. At forty. ''That's'' obscene."

His epitaph reads: "Beloved father – devoted son/Peace at last."

Like the song's previous incarnation [[Hello Muddah, Hello Fadduh (A Letter from Camp)]] which also enumerates many of the various abominable atrocities occurring at Camp Granada, the song's implication is that parents would be horrified that such an "adult-themed" performer would actually be deemed acceptable entertainment for impressionable young boys at a youth camp, further indicating how despicably debauched and alarmingly "loosely" the camp is being run.
