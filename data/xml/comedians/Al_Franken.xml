'''Alan Stuart Franken''' (born May 21, 1951) is an American comedian, writer, producer, author, and politician who served as a [[United States Senator]] from [[Minnesota]] from 2009 to 2018. He became well known in the 1970s and 1980s as a performer on the television comedy show ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (SNL). After decades as a comedic actor and writer, he became a prominent [[Liberalism in the United States|liberal]] political activist, hosting ''[[The Al Franken Show]]'' on [[Air America Radio]].

Franken was first elected to the [[United States Senate]] in [[United States Senate election in Minnesota, 2008|2008]] as the nominee of the [[Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party]] (DFL, an affiliate of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]), defeating incumbent [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Senator [[Norm Coleman]] by 312 votes out of nearly three million cast. He won [[United States Senate election in Minnesota, 2014|reelection in 2014]] with 53.2% of the vote over Republican challenger [[Mike McFadden]]. Franken resigned on January 2, 2018, after several allegations of sexual misconduct were made against him.

On ''[[Weekend Update]]'' near the end of [[Saturday Night Live (season 5)|Season 5]], Franken delivered a commentary called "[[A Limo For A Lame-O|A Limo for a Lame-O]]". He mocked controversial [[NBC]] president [[Fred Silverman]] as "a total unequivocal failure" and displayed a chart showing the poor ratings of NBC programs. As a result of this sketch, Silverman declined [[Lorne Michaels]]'s recommendation that Franken succeed him as producer, and Franken left the show when Michaels did, at the end of the 1979–80 season.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tom Shales|Shales, Tom]] (2003).

Franken signed a one-year contract in early 2004 to host a talk show for [[Air America Radio]]'s flagship program with co-host [[Katherine Lanpher]], who remained with the show until October 2005. The network was launched on March 31, 2004. Originally named ''The O'Franken Factor'' but renamed ''[[The Al Franken Show]]'' on July 12, 2004, the show aired three hours a day, five days a week for three years. Its stated goal was to put more progressive views on the public airwaves to counter what Franken perceived as the dominance of conservative syndicated commentary on the radio: "I'm doing this because I want to use my energies to get [[George W.

Preliminary reports on election night, November 4, were that Coleman was leading by over 700 votes, but the official results, certified on November 18, 2008, had Coleman leading by only 215 votes. As the two candidates were separated by less than 0.5 percent of the votes cast, the Minnesota [[Secretary of State of Minnesota|Secretary of State]], [[Mark Ritchie]], authorized the automatic recount provided for in Minnesota election law. In the recount, ballots and certifying materials were examined by hand, and candidates could file challenges to the legality of ballots or materials for inclusion or exclusion. On January 5, 2009, the [[Elections in Minnesota#Minnesota State Canvassing Board|Minnesota State Canvassing Board]] certified the recounted vote totals, with Franken ahead by 225 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=Chris |last1=Welch |first2=Ed |last2=Hornick |url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/01/05/minnesota.recount/ |title=Franken Declares Senate Race Win After State Ruling |publisher=CNN |date=January 6, 2009 |access-date=January 3, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100103190935/http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/01/05/minnesota.recount/ |archivedate=January 3, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
