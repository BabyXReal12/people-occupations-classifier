In March 2011, Ayoade directed the ''[[Community (TV series)|Community]]'' episode "[[Critical Film Studies]]" in the show's [[Community (season 2)|second season]]. The episode pays homage to the 1981 film ''[[My Dinner with Andre]]'' and was named the "most brilliant half-hour of TV to arrive in this century" by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' writer [[Rob Sheffield]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sheffield|first1=Rob|title=Community's "Critical Film Studies": Celebrating Two Years of the 21st Century's Greatest TV Episode|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/communitys-critical-film-studies-celebrating-two-years-of-the-2aast-century-s-greatest-tv-episode-20130329|website=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=16 June 2016|date=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ayoade then directed a performance of comedian [[Tommy Tiernan]]'s world stand-up tour, ''Crooked Man'', which was released in November 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Sheridan | first = Colette | title = Far from Hollywood | url = http://www.irishexaminer.com/features/far-from-hollywood-172068.html | date = 28 October 2011 | accessdate = 19 October 2012 | newspaper = [[Irish Examiner]] | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120606144210/http://www.irishexaminer.com/features/far-from-hollywood-172068.html | archivedate = 6 June 2012 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ayoade provided his voice to the main cast of Channel 4's ill-received animated sitcom ''[[Full English (TV series)|Full English]]'', which aired for just five episodes in 2012 before being cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Channel 4 shelves final episode of Full English|url=https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/news/1004/full_english_gypsy_episode_cancelled/|publisher=[[British Comedy Guide]]|accessdate=6 March 2018|date=17 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ayoade starred opposite [[Ben Stiller]], [[Vince Vaughn]] and [[Jonah Hill]] in the science fiction comedy ''[[The Watch (2012 film)|The Watch]]'' as a [[neighbourhood watch]] group that uncovers alien forces threatening the world.

Ayoade's second feature film, the black comedy thriller ''[[The Double (2013 film)|The Double]]'', was based on [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]'s 1846 novella ''[[The Double (Dostoyevsky novel)|The Double]]'' and written by Ayoade and Avi Korine.&lt;ref name="TheDouble"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kemp|first1=Stuart|title=Jesse Eisenberg, Mia Wasikowska Join ‘The Double’ Cast|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/jesse-eisenberg-mia-wasikowska-the-double-286385|website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate=6 March 2018|date=1 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It stars [[Jesse Eisenberg]] and [[Mia Wasikowska]].

Ayoade's first book ''Ayoade on Ayoade: A Cinematic Odyssey'' was published by [[Faber and Faber]] on 2 October 2014. It satirises the nature of interviews and books that document and analyse the careers of iconic film directors (e.g. [[Orson Welles]] and [[Martin Scorsese]]).
