'''William Maher''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ɑːr}}; born January 20, 1956)&lt;ref name=filmref /&gt; is an American comedian, political commentator, and television host. He is known for the [[HBO]] political talk show ''[[Real Time with Bill Maher]]'' (2003–present) and the similar [[Late night television in the United States|late-night]] show called ''[[Politically Incorrect]]'' (1993-2002), originally on [[Comedy Central]] and later on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]].

Maher is known for his sarcastic attitude,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qxa5uj95B84C&amp;pg=PA87 |title=American Scream: The Bill Hicks Story |first=Cynthia |last=True |publisher=HarperCollins |year=2002 |isbn=9780380803774 |page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[political satire]], and [[sociopolitical]] commentary.

Maher supports the legalization of cannabis and same-sex marriage. His critical views of religion were the basis for the 2008 documentary film ''[[Religulous]]''.

==Early life==
Maher was born in New York City. His father, William Aloysius Maher Jr.,&lt;ref name=fdr1/&gt; was a network news editor and radio announcer, and his mother, Julie Maher (née Berman), was a nurse.&lt;ref name="filmref"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.filmreference.com/film/32/Bill-Maher.html |title = Bill Maher Biography (1956–) |publisher = Film Reference |accessdate = January 17, 2008 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080108083123/http://www.filmreference.com/film/32/Bill-Maher.html| archivedate= January 8, 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was raised in his Irish-American father's Roman Catholic religion.

====''Politically Incorrect with Bill Maher''====
{{Main|Politically Incorrect}}
Maher assumed the host role on ''Politically Incorrect with Bill Maher'', a late-night political talk show that ran on Comedy Central from 1993 to 1997 and on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] from 1997 to 2002. The show regularly began with a topical monologue by Maher preceding the introduction of four guests, usually a diverse group of individuals, such as show business, popular culture, political pundits, political consultants, authors, and occasionally news figures. The group would discuss topical issues selected by Maher, who also participated in the discussions.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{Cite news |url = https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/27/arts/television-lots-of-political-humor-and-no-morton-kondracke.html?n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/People/M/Maher,%20Bill |title = TELEVISION; Lots of Political Humor, and No Morton Kondracke|date = February 27, 1994 |newspaper = The New York Times | first=Bill| last=Carter |accessdate = August 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jerry Seinfeld]], a regular guest on the show, stated that ''Politically Incorrect'' reminded him of talk shows from the 1950s and '60s "when guests interacted with each other as much as with the host".&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt;

''Politically Incorrect'' won an array of awards, including an [[Emmy Award]] for Outstanding Technical Direction, two [[CableACE]] awards for Best Talk Show Series, and a [[Genesis Award]] for Best Television Talk Show. Maher earned numerous award nominations for his producing, writing, and hosting of ''Politically Incorrect'', including ten [[Emmy]] nominations, two [[TV Guide]] nominations, and two [[Writers Guild of America|Writers Guild]] nominations. ABC decided against renewing Maher's contract for ''Politically Incorrect'' in 2002, after he made a controversial on-air remark six days after the [[September 11 attacks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thebigstory.org/ov/ov-politicallyincorrect.html |title=The Big Story: Politically Incorrect |accessdate=June 19, 2007 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070713120522/http://thebigstory.org/ov/ov-politicallyincorrect.html| archivedate= July 13, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; He agreed with his guest, conservative [[pundit (expert)|pundit]] [[Dinesh D'Souza]], that the 9/11 terrorists did not act in a cowardly manner (in rebuttal to [[George W. Bush|President Bush]]’s statement calling them cowards). Maher said, "We have been the cowards. Lobbing cruise missiles from 2,000 miles away. That's cowardly. Staying in the airplane when it hits the building. Say what you want about it. Not cowardly. You're right." Maher later clarified that his comment was not anti-military in any way whatsoever, referencing his well-documented longstanding support for the American military.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Goldberg |first=Danny |authorlink= |title=It's a Free Country: Personal Freedom in America After September&amp;nbsp;11 |publisher=RDV Books |year=2002 |page=77 |isbn=0-9719206-0-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Garofoli |first=Joe |title=Talk host's towering rant: S.F. not worth saving |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2005/11/11/MNGFMFMNV41.DTL |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle |accessdate=October 9, 2007 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071102175526/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=%2Fc%2Fa%2F2005%2F11%2F11%2FMNGFMFMNV41.DTL |archivedate=November 2, 2007 |deadurl=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; After receiving complaints, [[FedEx]] and [[Sears|Sears Roebuck]] pulled their advertisements from the show, costing the show significant revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Navasky |first=Victor |title=Profiles in Cowardice |url=http://www.thenation.com/doc/20011105/navasky |newspaper=[[The Nation]] |accessdate=October 9, 2007 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090630183528/http%3A//www%2Ethenation%2Ecom/doc/20011105/navasky |archivedate=June 30, 2009 |deadurl=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google1"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZjnUyVhccr4C&amp;pg=PA389 |title=Entertainment and Society: Influences, Impacts, and Innovations |last=Sayre |first=Shay |last2=King |first2=Cynthia |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=2010 |edition=2 |isbn=9780203882931 |accessdate=2013-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maher's remarks after 9/11 were not the first time he had sparked controversy on ''Politically Incorrect''. In the same year, he expressed his deep regrets and apologized after being widely criticized for comparing his dogs to retarded children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/18/us/tv-host-s-words-draw-criticism-and-apology.html | work=[[The New York Times]] | title=TV Host's Words Draw Criticism and Apology | date=January 18, 2001 | accessdate=April 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show was canceled on June 16, 2002, and the [[Sinclair Broadcast Group]] had dropped the show from its [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]-[[Network affiliate|affiliated]] stations months prior. On June 22, 2002, just six days after the cancellation of ''Politically Incorrect'', Maher received the Los Angeles Press Club president's award (for "championing free speech").&lt;ref name="google1"/&gt; Maher was on the board of judges for the 2002 [[PEN/Newman's Own First Amendment Award]].&lt;ref&gt;Siems, Larry (April 11, 2002).

====''Real Time with Bill Maher''====
{{Main|Real Time with Bill Maher}}
In 2003, Maher became the host, co-producer, and co-writer of ''Real Time with Bill Maher'', a weekly hour-long political comedy talk show on the cable television network [[HBO]]. In 2016, HBO renewed ''Real Time'' through 2018, for its 15th and 16th seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Prudom|first1=Laura|title=‘Real Time With Bill Maher’ Renewed Through 2018|url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/real-time-with-bill-maher-renewed-season-15-16-1201827123/|accessdate=August 1, 2016|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=30 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During an interview, Maher told [[Terry Gross]] (on NPR's ''[[Fresh Air]]'') that he much prefers having serious and well-informed guests on his program, as opposed to the random celebrities that fleshed out his roundtable discussions on ''Politically Incorrect''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4490632 | work=NPR | title=Bill Maher: Four More Years | date=February 8, 2005 | accessdate=August 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with his previous show, ''Politically Incorrect'', Maher begins ''Real Time'' with a comic opening monologue based upon current events and other topical issues. He proceeds to a one-on-one interview with a guest, either in-studio or via satellite. Following the interview, Maher sits with two or three panelists, usually consisting of [[pundit (expert)|pundits]], authors, activists, actors, politicians, and journalists, for a discussion of the week's events.

''Real Time'' has earned widespread praise. It has been nominated for more than ten Primetime [[Emmy Awards]] and six [[Writers Guild of America|Writer's Guild]] awards. In 2007, Maher and his co-producers were awarded the Television Producer of the Year Award in Variety Television by the Producers Guild of America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.producersguild.org/?page=PGA_Award_19902010&amp;hhSearchTerms=PGA+and+Award+and+Winners+and+1990-2010 Producers Guild of America Awards – Winners 1990-2010]; PGA.org; May 29, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Maher holds the record for the most Emmy nominations without a win, having been nominated on 22 occasions and not winning once. Eleven of the nominations were for ''Politically Incorrect'', while nine were for ''Real Time''. The other two were nominations for two of his HBO comedy specials: ''[[I'm Swiss]]'' and ''[[Bill Maher: The Decider]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://goldderby.latimes.com/awards_goldderby/2009/07/will-emmys-biggest-loser-bill-maher-ever-win.html | work=Los Angeles Times | title=Gold Derby | date=July 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Notable responses to ''Real Time'' episodes=====
In late May 2005, Alabama Congressman [[Spencer Bachus]] sent a letter to [[Time Warner]]'s board of directors requesting ''Real Time'' be canceled after remarks Maher made after noting the military had missed its recruiting goals by 42 percent. Bachus said he felt the comments were demeaning to the military and treasonous.

In February 2017, Maher invited [[Milo Yiannopoulos]] to be interviewed on ''Real Time.'' Yiannopoulos accepted, despite protests from some commentators and fans. The appearance on Maher's show harmed Yannopoulos's career due to comments in the interview where he seemed to express sympathy toward perpetrators of child sexual abuse. In the days following the interview, Yiannopoulos had his invitation to speak before the 2017 [[Conservative Political Action Conference]], as well as a book deal with [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], cancelled. Yiannopoulos subsequently resigned as an editor at [[Breitbart News]]. When asked whether Yiannopoulos's interview on his show was among the causes of his resignation, Maher concurred, saying, "As I say, sunlight is the best disinfectant.

===Other work===
In 2004 Maher appeared on stage as Satan in [[The Steve Allen Theater]] production of "Hollywood Hell House", a spoof of the Christian-run [[hell house]]s. The show was a faithful reproduction of an evangelistic scare-experience written by Reverend Keenan Roberts to terrify teenagers into declaring themselves Christians. "Our faith is that putting this up as itself, it will hoist itself on its own petard, that it's comical just as it is," explained producer Maggie Rowe. The show featured a rotating cast of over 160 celebrities, including [[Andy Richter]] (Jesus), [[Richard Belzer]], [[Dave Thomas (actor)|Dave Thomas]], [[Traci Lords]], [[Craig Bierko]], [[Sarah Silverman]], and [[Julia Sweeney]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2004/aug/22/entertainment/ca-artsnotes22.3|title=Scared straight to Hollywood|first=Lynne|last=Heffley|date=August 22, 2004|publisher=|via=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maher and director [[Larry Charles]] teamed up to make the movie ''[[Religulous]]'', described by trade publication ''Variety'' as a documentary "that spoofs religious extremism across the world". It was released on October 3, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Demara, Bruce. (September 10, 2007.) [https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/article/254761 "Maher preaches to the TIFF choir"]. ''[[The Toronto Star]]''.

Also in 2013, Maher appeared on ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'' and offered to pay $5 million to a charity if [[Donald Trump]] would produce his [[birth certificate]] to prove that Trump's mother had not mated with an [[orangutan]].  This was said by Maher in response to Trump having previously challenged President [[Barack Obama]] to produce his birth certificate, and having offered $5 million payable to a charity of Obama's choice if Obama would produce his college applications, transcripts, and passport records.&lt;ref name="Allen6Feb" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lee1Nov"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nydailynews.com/news/election-2012/trump-puts-kibosh-5m-offer-obama-article-1.1195668 |title=Trump puts kibosh on $5M offer to Obama |work=Daily News |location=New York |first=Kristen A. |last=Lee |date=November 1, 2012 |accessdate=August 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to Maher's offer, Trump produced his birth certificate, and then [[Legal affairs of Donald Trump|Trump launched a lawsuit]] after Maher was not forthcoming, claiming that Maher's $5 million offer was legally binding.

Maher favors ending [[corporate welfare]] and federal funding of [[Non-profit organization|non-profits]] as well as the legalization of gambling, prostitution, and cannabis.

On the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]], Maher says he is "more on the side of the Israelis" and doesn't consider both sides equally guilty. He acknowledges that "Palestinians do have gripes", and he has been critical of U.S. financial aid to Israel, saying "they don't need our money, they can handle it themselves." Maher also notes that most Israelis would prefer a two-state solution and oppose the hard-line stance of their Israeli government, which he describes as having been taken over by their version of the Tea Party. However, Maher has defended Israel's military actions against Palestinian militants amid criticism over civilian deaths and disproportionate casualty count between Israelis and Palestinians during the [[2014 Israel–Gaza conflict|2014 Gaza war]]. He argues that Israel is still showing restraint, and he finds it ironic that the same people who were incredulous over how the Jews in World War II were led "to their slaughter", can't understand why they are defending themselves now.&lt;ref name="Jewish Journal" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediaite.com/tv/%E2%80%98people-die-in-wars%E2%80%99-maher-and-guests-battle-over-gaza-civilian-deaths/ Bill Maher Defends Israel Again: 'People Die in Wars], Mediaite, August 1, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Maher is a gun owner, and explained in his February 12, 2013 appearance on the late night TV talk show ''[[Conan (talk show)|Conan]]'' that he owns guns for personal home protection. However, he does not identify himself as a "proud" gun owner, commenting that being a proud gun owner is akin to "saying I'm a 'proud remote control owner'". Maher has stated that statistics showing that gun owners are more likely to harm a member of their household are caused by irresponsible gun owners, and believes that tragedies such as school shootings will not lead to fundamental change in gun laws because both [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] favor guns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Walls Have Ears, and Other Side Effects of This Medication|series=[[Conan (talk show)|Conan]]|season=3|number=45|airdate=February 12, 2013|network=[[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 7, 2013, Bill Maher expressed on his show limited support for the [[National Security Agency|NSA's]] [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]] intelligence data collection from private phone calls and the Internet, saying that the threat of terrorists obtaining and using nuclear weapons was the tipping point for him. While he stated that he trusted the Obama administration to employ the program responsibly, he described the NSA's access to private data as a "slippery slope", and worried about whether other politicians would be as responsible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Garcia, Arturo|url=http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2013/06/07/maher-defends-nsa-data-searches-its-not-because-im-brave-but-because-im-scared/|title=Maher defends NSA data searches: It's not because I'm brave, but because I'm scared|publisher=[[The Raw Story]]|date=June 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the leadup to the 2014 midterm elections, Maher conducted a "Flip a District" contest on his HBO show. His audience was asked to select one "terrible, entrenched" member of Congress in a close election race—"the loserest loser of all"—to remove from office. Maher aimed to help oust that representative by shining a "national spotlight" on the politician during segments of his show and stand-up comedy appearances in that member's district during the Fall election.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/31/arts/television/maher-wants-his-show-to-decide-a-house-race.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;smid=tw-thecaucus&amp;_r=1 Maher Wants His Show to Decide a House Race]; New York Times; Bill Carter; January 30, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.real-time-with-bill-maher-blog.com/index/2014/1/31/test Flip a District]; Real Time with Bill Maher; June 3, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Maher endorsed [[Maine Question 1, 2014|a 2014 Maine referendum]] to ban the use of bait, traps, and dogs to hunt bears in Maine. He specifically criticized the use of bait, referring to its use as "nothing but an execution".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=[[Bangor Daily News]] |url=http://stateandcapitol.bangordailynews.com/2014/09/15/famous-talk-show-host-bill-maher-endorses-referendum-to-ban-bear-baiting/|title=Famous talk show host Bill Maher endorses referendum to ban bear baiting |date=September 15, 2014 |accessdate=September 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 U.S. presidential election]], Maher initially endorsed Senator [[Bernie Sanders]] on February 5, 2016.

Maher is highly [[Criticism of religion|critical of all religion]] and views it as highly destructive. He has been described, or self-identified, variously as an agnostic, [[Atheism|atheist]], and [[Apatheism|apatheist]], while objecting to having his views defined by a single label. In his 2008 feature film ''[[Religulous]]'', he refers to himself as agnostic.&lt;ref&gt;Holden, Stephen (September 30, 2008). [https://movies.nytimes.com/2008/10/01/movies/01reli.html "Believers, Skeptics and a Pool of Sitting Ducks"], ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt; He has rejected being grouped with explicit atheists, saying in 2002, "I'm not an atheist. There's a really big difference between an atheist and someone who just doesn't believe in religion. Religion to me is a bureaucracy between man and God that I don't need, but I'm not an atheist, no."&lt;ref name=AVClub&gt;Thompson, Stephen (October 9, 2002). [http://www.avclub.com/articles/is-there-a-god,1413/ "Is There a God?"]. ''[[The A.V. Club]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Maher has also occasionally referred to himself as an apatheist, saying in 2011 "I don't know what happens when you die, and I don't care." When discussing his apatheism and his views on the existence of God, he said on a scale from 1 to 7 (7 being "absolutely certain there is no god"), he was only at 6.9, like [[Richard Dawkins]], "because we just don't know ... but we just don't think about it." He added, "There's atheist and there's agnostic, and I'm okay with us not splitting the difference on those; if you are just not a super-religious person, you are on my team."&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;[http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2011/07/12/maher-on-religion/ "Bill Maher explains his 'apatheism,' apathetic atheism"]. [[CNN]] Belief Blogs. July 12, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Several months later on a 2012 episode of his HBO show, Maher declared that "idiots must stop claiming that atheism is a religion. [...] believe it or not, I don't really enjoy talking about religion all the time. In fact, not only is atheism not a religion, it's not even my hobby, and that's the best thing about being an atheist. It requires so little of your time."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hbo.com/real-time-with-bill-maher/episodes/0/236-episode/article/new-rules.html HBO: Real Time with Bill Maher; Episode 236 – New Rules]; Home Box Office; February 3, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; He has reiterated his stance during other interviews, rejecting both the certitude of the existence, as well as the certitude of nonexistence of deities, concluding, "I'm saying that doubt is the only appropriate response for human beings."&lt;ref&gt;[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/article6010432.ece "Bill Maher: The God Botherer"]. ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' April 1, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

While critical of all organized religions, saying "they're all stupid and dangerous”, Maher says all religions are not alike, and has drawn comparisons and contrasts between them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rawstory.com/2015/01/bill-maher-on-paris-massacre-there-are-no-great-religions-theyre-all-stupid-and-dangerous/ Bill Maher on Paris massacre: 'There are no great religions — they’re all stupid and dangerous']; ''Raw Story''; January 8, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schwarwtz, Ian (September 23, 2012).

''[[The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; He has described Christianity and Islam as more "warlike", and has asserted that, like historic Christianity, present-day Islam needs to undergo its own [[reformation]] and [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]].&lt;ref name="VF1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kohn|first1=Sally|title=Petition All You Want, Bill Maher Will Speak at Berkeley|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/news/politics/2014/12/bill-maher-interview-islam-berkeley |work=Vanity Fair |date=December 2014 |accessdate=13 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In defense of his criticism of Islam, Sharia law and Muslim culture, Maher says he is "... someone who believes in the values that Western people believe in that a lot of the Muslim world does not. Like separation of church and state. Like equality of the sexes. Like respect for minorities, free elections, free speech, freedom to gather. These things are not just different from cultures that don't have them.... It's better ...

Maher has criticized liberals as hypocritical for defending these core liberal values and ideals only at home, while not condemning the oppression of these values and groups in Muslim culture.&lt;ref name="VF1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sasson|first1=Eric|title=Yes, Bill Maher Is Boorish.

"I'm just shining a light on the reality of the situation. I don't even understand why this is so controversial."&lt;ref name="VF1"/&gt;

Maher received the 2009 [[Richard Dawkins Award]] from [[Atheist Alliance International]].&lt;ref&gt;Timonen, Josh (September 28, 2009). [http://old.richarddawkins.net/articles/4388 "A note about the 'Richard Dawkins Award' being presented to Bill Maher this weekend"]. [[The Richard Dawkins Foundation]]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130623001937/http://old.richarddawkins.net/articles/4388 |date=June 23, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is an advisory board member of author [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]]'s [[Project Reason]], a foundation that promotes scientific knowledge and secular values within society.

===Health care===
Maher has stated that the [[American Medical Association]] is a powerful lobbying group and one of the primary reasons why the United States had failed to enact health care reform.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"&gt;(2009-06-15). {{YouTube|wJ2L1aQy-io|Keith Olbermann: Bill Maher Talks About Taking On Obama}}.{{Dead link|date=July 2011}} Countdown With Keith Olbermann.

On the topic of getting [[Health care reform in the United States|health care reform]] legislation passed, Maher stated that Obama should forget about trying to get 60 votes for it, "he only needs 51." "Forget getting the sixty votes or sixty percent—sixty percent of people don't believe in evolution in this country—he just needs to drag them to it, like I said, they're stupid; get health care done, with or without them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV Media |url=http://www.tonightshowwithconanobrien.com/video/clips/bill-maher-pt2-082409/1149697/ |title=Bill Maher Part 2 |work=The Tonight Show |accessdate=October 18, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090830072642/http://www.tonightshowwithconanobrien.com/video/clips/bill-maher-pt2-082409/1149697/ |archivedate=August 30, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[Fox News Channel|Fox News]] in a televised debate with [[Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]], Maher said that "if Jesus was in charge of the country we'd probably have health care for everybody."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mediaite.com/tv/bill-maher-on-the-factor-part-ii-the-two-bills-clash-on-religion/ |title=Bill Maher On ''The Factor'', Part II: The Two Bills Clash On Religion |date=September 30, 2010 |last=Davis |first=Glenn |publisher=Mediaite |accessdate=February 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maher has expressed the view that a lot of illness is the result of poor diet and lack of exercise, and that medicine is often not the most appropriate way of addressing illness. In an episode of his show about the 2008 presidential candidates' health plans, Maher stated that poor nutrition is a primary cause of illness, and that "the answer isn't another pill."&lt;ref&gt;''Real Time with Bill Maher''; [https://web.archive.org/web/20071015061830/http://hbo.com/billmaher/new_rules/20070928.html September 28, 2007]; HBO&lt;/ref&gt; He also has said: "If you believe you need to take all the pills the pharmaceutical industry says you do, then you're already on drugs!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.winhs.org/ |publisher=WINHS, World Institute of Natural Health Sciences |title=Home |accessdate=2012-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has expressed his distaste for the [[Pharmaceutical drug|pharmaceutical]] and health care industries in general, on the grounds that they make their money out of treating people who are made sick by consuming [[junk food|unhealthy food]] that corporations urge upon the public. He maintains that mass consumption of [[high-fructose corn syrup]] is a contributor to the rise in frequency of [[obesity in the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0409/13/lkl.00.html Larry King Live – Interview With Bill Maher]; CNN; September 13, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

In a discussion with [[Michael Moore]] about the film ''[[Sicko]]'', Maher said, "The human body is pretty amazing; it doesn't get sick, usually, for no reason. I mean, there's some genetic stuff that can get to you, but, basically, people are sick in this country because they're poisoned. The environment is a poisoning factor, but also, we gotta say, they poison themselves. They eat shit. People eat shit, and that's, to my way of thinking, about 90 percent of why people are sick, is because they eat shit."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kerry-trueman/maher-and-moore-chew-out-_b_50004.html Maher and Moore Chew (Out) the Fat]; Kerry Trueman, ''The Huffington Post''; May 30, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tara Parker-Pope]] and former Senator [[Bill Frist]] have called his criticism of the [[2009 flu pandemic vaccine|H1N1 flu vaccinations]] unscientific.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/10/13/bill-maher-vs-the-flu-vaccine/ | work=The New York Times | first=Tara | last=Parker-Pope | date=October 13, 2009 | title=Bill Maher vs. the Flu Vaccine | accessdate=April 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infectious diseases expert [[Paul Offit]] has written that misinformation about vaccines from celebrities like Maher has put children at unnecessary risk. Offit says that celebrities like Maher are seen as "less credible" and would still be considered just "great entertainment" if they weren't joined by the former Director of the [[National Institutes of Health]], Dr. [[Bernadine Healy]] and influential pediatrician, [[Robert Sears (physician)|Dr. Robert Sears]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Offit|first=Paul|title=Deadly Choices: How the Anti-Vaccine Movement Threatens us all |publisher=Basic Books|authorlink=Paul Offit|pages=168–171}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oncologist]] [[David Gorski]] has also criticized Maher's beliefs about vaccines several times in [[ScienceBlogs]], and when Maher received the Richard Dawkins Award in 2009, Gorski wrote it was inappropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gorski|first=David|title=Bill Maher gets the Richard Dawkins Award?

I'm not a germ theory denier. I believe vaccinations can work. Polio is a good example. Do I think in certain situations that inoculating Third World children against malaria or diphtheria, or whatever, is right? Of course. In a situation like that, the benefits outweigh costs. But to me living in Los Angeles? To get a flu shot? No."&lt;ref&gt;Slotek, Jim (October 28, 2009). [http://www.winnipegsun.com/entertainment/tv/2009/10/28/11548266-sun.html "Needling Bill Maher"].

===Views on 9/11 conspiracy theories===
Maher has been a critic of [[9/11 conspiracy theories]]. On October 19, 2007, Maher confronted several [[9/11 Truth movement|9/11 truthers]] and had them ejected from his show audience after they interrupted the live show numerous times by calling out from the audience. The incident drew significant media attention and praise from Fox News talk show host and frequent critic [[John Gibson (political commentator)|John Gibson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url = http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,304240,00.html |title = Hat's Off to Bill Maher |date = October 22, 2007 |publisher = Fox News |accessdate = January 17, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071225170927/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0%2C2933%2C304240%2C00.html |archivedate = December 25, 2007 |deadurl = no |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2004, at the end of their 17-month relationship, she sued him for US$9 million for "pain and suffering" for alleged "insulting, humiliating and degrading racial comments".
