Morris has since become a familiar funny guy as one of BET’s most visible on-air personalities, with his comedic antics and coverage for many of the network’s top-rated shows. From signature skits like “The Package” leading up to the annual [[BET Awards]] to segments for ''[[106 &amp; Park]]'', BET’s [[Spring Bling]]: Fashion 5-0, 106 &amp; Party, Top 100 Countdown, Grammy Nomination Special, and many more. Most recently Morris has been seen as the co-host of the daily music and entertainment news show ''[[BET Now]]'' with Alesha Renee.

With his recent relocation from [[New York City|New York]] to [[Los Angeles]], Morris has begun developing several of his own show concepts and is up for several film and television projects.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

However, Wayans' other comedy series, ''[[Happy Endings (TV series)|Happy Endings]]'', had already been picked up for a second season on rival network [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. The producers of ''New Girl'' initially planned to recast Wayans' role,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.deadline.com/2011/05/abc-renews-happy-endings/&lt;/ref&gt; but later decided not to recast and instead write his character out in the second episode.
