In 2012, Chandrasekhar made the movie ''[[The Babymakers]].''&lt;ref name=HuffPo-Babymakers-2012&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chandrasekhar|first1=Jay|title=Things Have Changed Since Super Troopers|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jay-chandrasekhar/the-babymakers_b_1730768.html|accessdate=29 August 2014|work=[[Huffington Post]]|date=2 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He directed several episodes of ''[[Blue Mountain State]]''.

He appeared as racist comedian Gupta Gupti Gupta in the episode "Basic Email Security" of ''[[Community (TV series)|Community]]''.

=== Stand-up ===
Chandrasekhar often does stand-up comedy, sometimes touring with fellow Broken Lizard friends, [[Steve Lemme]] and [[Kevin Heffernan (actor)|Kevin Heffernan]].&lt;ref name=WashingtonPost-Drafthouse-2014&gt;{{cite news|last1=Greenberg|first1=Ruth|title=‘Super Troopers’ star Jay Chandrasekhar slings jokes at the Arlington Cinema &amp; Drafthouse|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/express/wp/2014/08/28/super-troopers-jay-chandrasekhar-slings-jokes-at-the-arlington-cinema-drafthouse/|accessdate=30 August 2014|work=[[Washington Post]]|date=28 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His stand-up is a mix of jokes and stories, which are usually pretty dirty.

== Personal life ==
Chandrasekhar has been married to actress Susan Clarke since 2005.&lt;ref name=ChaiTime-File-2011&gt;{{cite news|title=The Jay Chandrasekhar File|url=http://www.khabar.com/magazine/chaitime/the_jay_chandrasekhar_file|accessdate=30 August 2014|work=Chai Time|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have three children, an older son and twins. Chandrasekhar's middle name, Jambulingam, is in honor of his grandfather, and is also his son's middle name.&lt;ref name=Rediff-Big-2005 /&gt; During an interview with [[Stephen Colbert]] in 2017, Chandrasekhar stated that the name Jambulingam translates literally in English as "large penis," however, it is intended "as a euphemism for power."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jay Chandrasekhar Hung Out (Carefully) With Willie Nelson|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJjyJvjAP34|website=YouTube|accessdate=3 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
