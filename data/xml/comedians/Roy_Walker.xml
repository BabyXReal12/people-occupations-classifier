'''Robert''' "'''Roy'''" '''Walker''' (born 31 July 1940) is a Northern Irish television personality and comedian, who worked for many years as both a television presenter and comedy actor. He is best known as the original host of the game show ''[[Catchphrase (UK game show)|Catchphrase]]'' between 1986 and 1999, and as one of the stars of the comedy showcase ''[[The Comedians (1971 TV series)|The Comedians]]''.

==Early life==
Born in [[Belfast]], as a teenager Walker performed in the Francis Longford Choir, then worked as a riveter in the [[Harland and Wolff]] shipyard. He was the Northern Ireland champion [[hammer throw]]er for three years, and represented his country internationally.&lt;ref name="rw-bio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roywalker.co.uk/biog.htm|title=Biography|publisher=Roy Walker|accessdate=15 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spent a short time as a comedy partner of [[James Young (comedian)|James Young]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} before serving seven years in the [[British Army]].&lt;ref name="rw2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allstartalentshow.co.uk/royw.html |title=All Star Talent Show |accessdate=March 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008114929/http://www.allstartalentshow.co.uk/royw.html |archivedate=8 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Walker first started work aged 12. By the end of the 1960s, he was running a pawn shop whilst working in the evenings as the [[Master of Ceremonies|compère]] at the Talk of the Town club in Belfast. [[The Troubles]], a continuing threat of violence between political groups in Northern Ireland, was ongoing at this time. Though Walker was a Protestant and a Unionist, he was confronted by two men, who claimed he supported Irish Independence. They threatened him at gunpoint and gave him 24 hours notice to close the shop. Walker complied, and the shop was destroyed. He decided to leave Northern Ireland and work in Britain, touring as a professional comedian, in [[working men's club]]s and cabaret.&lt;ref name="scotsman4328664"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://scotlandonsunday.scotsman.com/sos-review/Roy-Walker-Goodbye-Mr-Chips.4328664.jp|title=Roy Walker: Goodbye Mr Chips, hello salad days|last=Smith|first=Aidan|date=27 July 2008|work=[[Scotland on Sunday]]|accessdate=11 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|''""I'd been 'Mr Belfast' but in [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]] I had to wait by the phone at nine o'clock hoping that some other poor comic had been paid off after his first act.
