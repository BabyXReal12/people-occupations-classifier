'''Howard Allan Stern''' (born January 12, 1954) is an American radio and television personality, producer, author, actor, and photographer. He is best known for his radio show ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'', which gained popularity when it was nationally syndicated on terrestrial radio from 1986 to 2005. Stern has broadcast on [[Sirius XM Holdings|Sirius XM Radio]] since 2006. 

Stern landed his first radio jobs while at [[Boston University]]. From 1976 to 1982, Stern developed his on-air personality through morning positions at [[WXPK|WRNW]] in [[Briarcliff Manor, New York|Briarcliff Manor]], New York, [[WCCC (FM)|WCCC]] in [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]], [[Connecticut]], [[WDTW-FM|WWWW]] in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], and [[WWDC-FM|WWDC]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] Stern worked afternoons at [[WNBC (AM)|WNBC]] in [[New York City]] from 1982 until his firing in 1985. In 1985, he began a 20-year run at [[WNYL (FM)|WXRK]] in New York City; his morning show entered syndication in 1986 and aired in 60 [[media market|markets]] and attracted 20 million listeners at its peak. Stern won numerous industry awards, including [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']]’s Nationally Syndicated Air Personality of the Year eight consecutive times, and is the first to have the number one morning show in New York City and [[Los Angeles]] simultaneously. He became the most fined radio host when the [[Federal Communications Commission]] [[FCC fines of The Howard Stern Show|issued fines]] totaling $2.5 million to station owners for content it deemed indecent. Stern became one of the highest paid radio figures after signing a five-year deal with Sirius in 2004 worth $500 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2004/10/07/sirius-lands-a-big-dog-howard-stern/0c7ee3dc-5e1a-4094-8f4b-243ce9afb9b5/|title=Sirius Lands a Big Dog: Howard Stern|first1=Frank|last1=Ahrens|first2=Howard|last2=Kurtz|date=October 7, 2004|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=December 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, Stern's photography has been featured in ''[[Hamptons (magazine)|Hamptons]]'' and ''[[WHIRL Magazine|WHIRL]]'' magazines. From 2012 to 2015, he served as a judge on ''[[America's Got Talent]]''.

Stern has described himself as "King of All Media" since 1992 for his successes outside radio. He hosted and produced numerous late night [[Howard Stern television shows|television shows]], [[Howard Stern videography and discography|pay-per-view events, and home videos]]. His two books, ''[[Private Parts (book)|Private Parts]]'' (1993) and ''[[Miss America (book)|Miss America]]'' (1995), entered [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]] at number one and sold over one million copies. The former was made into a [[Private Parts (1997 film)|biographical comedy film]] in 1997 that had Stern and his radio show [[The Howard Stern Show staff|staff]] star as themselves. It topped the US box office in its opening week and grossed $41.2 million domestically. Stern performs on its soundtrack, which charted the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] at number one and was certified [[RIAA certification|platinum]] for one million copies sold.

==Early life==
Howard Allan Stern was born on January 12, 1954, the second child of Ben and Ray (''[[née]]'' Schiffman) Stern who lived in the [[Jackson Heights, Queens|Jackson Heights]] neighborhood of [[Queens]] in New York City.{{sfn|Colford|1997|p=2}} Stern's parents are [[Jewish]], and their families are from Poland and [[Austria-Hungary]].{{sfn|Colford|1997|p=2}} Ray was an office clerk in New York City{{sfn|Colford|1997|p=2}}{{sfn|Stern|Sloman|1993|p=44}} before she became a homemaker and later took up work as an [[Respiratory therapist|inhalation therapist]].{{sfn|Stern|Sloman|1993|p=92}} Ben served in the U.S. Army on Long Island and in California during the war. He later worked as a radio engineer at [[WZRC|WHOM]] in [[Manhattan]]{{sfn|Colford|1997|p=7}} and as a co-owner and operator at Aura Recording Inc., a Manhattan recording studio where cartoons and commercials were cut.{{sfn|Colford|1997|p=7}} Stern described his older sister Ellen as the "complete opposite" of himself and "very quiet."{{sfn|Stern|Sloman|1993|p=46}}

In 1955, the family moved to [[Roosevelt, New York|Roosevelt]], New York on Long Island{{sfn|Colford|1997|p=3}} where Stern attended Washington-Rose Elementary School followed by [[Roosevelt High School (Roosevelt, New York)|Roosevelt Junior-Senior High School]].{{sfn|Colford|1997|p=9}} Stern also attended [[Hebrew school]] where he was given the name Tzvi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|first=Howard|last=Stern|series=The Howard Stern Show|date=September 15, 2014|station=Howard 100|time=7:00 a.m. hour}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a youngster Stern took five years of piano lessons&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbs.com/shows/late_show/wahoo_gazette/1001578/|title=Dave and Howard Stern dance and make up|date=November 22, 2013|publisher=CBS|accessdate=February 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and took an interest in [[marionette]]s, using them to entertain his friends with explicit shows. He formed a band with two school friends, the Electric Comicbook, on vocals and keyboards.{{sfn|Colford|1997|p=6}} From the age of nine to his second year at university, Stern spent his summers at Camp Wel-Met, a youth camp in [[Narrowsburg, New York|Narrowsburg]], New York where he worked camper, kitchen, and counselor duties. He recalled his time there as "the greatest experience."{{sfn|Luerssen|2009|p=172}}

Stern wished to be in radio at the age of five.{{sfn|Stern|Sloman|1993|p=111}} He was an infrequent listener in his youth, but names talk personalities [[Bob Grant (radio host)|Bob Grant]] and [[Brad Crandall]] as early influences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/5876916/howard-stern-the-billboard-cover-qa|title=Howard Stern: The Billboard Cover Q&amp;A|date=January 20, 2014|work=Billboard|first1=Silvio|last1=Pietroluongo|first2=Gary|last2=Trust|accessdate=January 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kingtranscript/&gt; His father set up a microphone, tape machine and turntable in the basement of his home which Stern used to record his make-believe radio shows, incorporating different characters and pre-recorded prank calls, sketches, and commercials.{{sfn|Colford|1997|p=6, 9}} He made several visits to his father's recording studio and witnessed "some of the great voice guys" work with him, including [[Don Adams]] and [[Larry Storch]] voice ''[[Tennessee Tuxedo and His Tales]]'', which began his desire to be on the air and "do a show," rather than play records.&lt;ref name=kingtranscript&gt;{{cite news|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0601/05/lkl.01.html|title=CNN Larry King Live – Interview With Howard Stern|publisher=CNN Transcripts|date=January 5, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130728060103/http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0601/05/lkl.01.html|archivedate=July 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Stern|Sloman|1993|p=114}}{{sfn|Stern|Sloman|1993|p=113}} In the late 1960s, Roosevelt became a predominantly black area; Stern remembered just "a handful of white kids" had remained in his school and repeated instances of bullying from black pupils.{{sfn|Stern|Sloman|1993|p=65}} In June 1969, the family moved to nearby [[Rockville Centre, New York|Rockville Centre]], and Stern, at age fifteen, transferred to [[South Side High School (Rockville Centre, New York)|South Side High School]] where he became "a total introvert."{{sfn|Colford|1997|p=17}} He graduated from the school in 1972;{{sfn|Colford|1997|pp=16–17}} his yearbook lists Stern's sole student activity, a member of [[Key Club]].&lt;ref name=Ketcham&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/12/nyregion/about-long-island-at-the-repository-of-high-school-memories.html?pagewanted=all|first=Diane|last=Ketcham|title=At the Repository of High School Memories|accessdate=September 12, 2013|date=February 12, 1995|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, Stern declined a place at [[Elmira College]] to instead pursue a Communications degree at [[Boston University]],{{sfn|Colford|1997|p=28}} but his average high school grades caused him to spend the first two years in its College of Basic Studies.{{sfn|Stern|Sloman|1993|p=115}} In his second year, he started work at the campus radio station [[WTBU (college radio)|WTBU]], where he played records, read the news, and hosted interview programs.{{sfn|Stern|Sloman|1993|p=115}} He later co-hosted a weekly comedy show with three fellow students named ''The King Schmaltz Bagel Hour'' which was initially canceled during its first broadcast for a racial sketch named "Godzilla Goes to Harlem".{{sfn|Stern|Sloman|1993|p=115–117}} Stern took cannabis, Quaaludes, and LSD during his studies, but quit after he experienced a difficult trip on too much LSD.{{sfn|Stern|Sloman|1993|p=114}} In 1974, he gained admission to the university's [[Boston University College of Communication|School of Public Communications]].{{sfn|Colford|1997|p=31, 33}} He then studied for a diploma at the Radio Engineering Institute of Electronics in [[Fredericksburg, Virginia|Fredericksburg]], Virginia in July 1975 which earned him a first-class [[General radiotelephone operator license|radio-telephone operator license]], a required certificate for all radio broadcasters at the time which was issued by the [[Federal Communications Commission]].{{sfn|Stern|Sloman|1993|p=121}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=VWQzAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=tgcGAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4720%2C66309|title=Stern's Start|work=The Free Lance-Star|first=Michael|last=Zitz|date=July 1, 1994|accessdate=May 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the license, Stern landed his first professional radio job at [[WNTN]] in [[Newton, Massachusetts|Newton]], Massachusetts from August to December 1975 doing air shifts, news casting, and production work.{{sfn|Stern|Sloman|1993|p=123}} For the next five months, he taught students basic electronics in preparation for their own FCC exams.{{sfn|Stern|Sloman|1993|p=123}} In May 1976, Stern graduated ''[[Latin honors#Types|magna cum laude]]'' with a 3.8-[[Grading (education)|grade point average]].

==Career==
{{see also|The Howard Stern Show}}

===1976–1981: WRNW, WCCC, and WWWW===
In his search for radio work following his graduation, Stern declined an offer to work evenings at [[WXPK|WRNW]], a [[progressive rock]] station in [[Briarcliff Manor, New York|Briarcliff Manor]], New York.{{sfn|Stern|Sloman|1993|p=118}} He stopped and was unsure of his talent and questioned his future as a professional in the industry, writing "I freaked out. I got real nervous that I wasn't good enough".{{sfn|Stern|Sloman|1993|p=118}} Stern accepted a marketing role at [[Benton &amp; Bowles]], a New York advertising agency, which he soon "quit without giving notice" in favor of a position in the creative department. He lasted three hours before he was fired "because their personnel department realized that I was the guy who just quit."{{sfn|Stern|Sloman|1993|p=118}} Stern then worked in Queens as a radio salesman selling advertising time without considerable success. He wrote, "All of a sudden ... I realized I had turned down a job in radio". With encouragement from his mother and girlfriend, Stern contacted WRNW for work and agreed to take cover shifts surrounding the Christmas holidays in 1976.{{sfn|Stern|Sloman|1993|p=123}}{{sfn|Stern|Sloman|1993|p=119}} Impressed with his reliability and professional approach, the station's director hired Stern full-time for a four-hour midday shift for six days a week, for $96 a week.{{sfn|Stern|Sloman|1993|p=121}} After several months, Stern became the station's production director which lasted until November 1977 when he became its program director for an increased salary of $250 a week.{{sfn|Stern|Sloman|1993|p=123}}{{sfn|Stern|Sloman|1993|p=122}} To save money, Stern rented a room in a [[monastery]] in [[Armonk, New York|Armonk]], New York.&lt;ref name=rs1990&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/who-is-howard-stern-rolling-stones-1990-feature-20110316|work=Rolling Stone|title=Who Is Howard Stern? Rolling Stone's 1990 Feature|date=March 16, 2011|accessdate=November 22, 2014|first=David|last=Wild}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, Stern spotted an advertisement in ''[[Radio &amp; Records]]'' for a "wild, fun morning guy" at rock station [[WCCC (FM)|WCCC]] in [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]], Connecticut.{{sfn|Stern|Sloman|1993|p=125}} He used some morning air time to assemble an [[aircheck]] with more outrageous bits, including [[Robert Klein]] and [[Cheech and Chong]] records with added flatulence routines and one-liners.{{sfn|Colford|1997|p=45}} Stern was hired for the same salary but worked a more intense schedule. After four hours on the air, he voiced and produced commercials for another four. On Saturdays, following a six-hour show, he did production work for the next three. He also completed duties as the station's public affairs director and hosted a Sunday morning talk show which he favored above playing records{{sfn|Stern|Sloman|1993|pp=126–127}} as it "represented what I wanted to do on the radio more than anything. Take the average guy and dissect what he does".{{sfn|Luerssen|2009|p=157}} In the summer of the [[1979 energy crisis]], Stern urged listeners to a two-day boycott of [[Shell Oil Company]], a stunt which attracted media attention.{{sfn|Colford|1997|p=48}} It was at WCCC where Stern first met [[Fred Norris]], the overnight disc jockey, who went on to become Stern's writer and producer since 1981.{{sfn|Colford|1997|p=74}} Stern left WCCC in early 1980 after he was denied a "lousy, stinking twenty-five-dollar-a-week raise."{{sfn|Stern|Sloman|1993|p=128}} At the same time, local rival station [[WHCN]] had assembled tapes and press clippings of Stern and forwarded them to Burkhart/Abrams, a radio consulting firm, to get Stern out of the Hartford [[media market|market]] as a rise in his ratings increased his threat to the station's numbers.{{sfn|Colford|1997|p=51}} The tapes were received by Dwight Douglas, a consultant at Burkhart/Abrams, who offered Stern work in [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], Ohio, but Stern declined.{{sfn|Stern|Sloman|1993|p=128}}

In his search for new work, Stern found an advertised position in ''Radio &amp; Records'' for a morning host at [[WDTW-FM|WWWW]], a struggling rock station in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]]. His aircheck was well received by management who made an offer,{{sfn|Colford|1997|p=52}} but Douglas advised Stern against the move and suggested to wait for an offer from a better station. Stern went ahead regardless and accepted a deal, starting on April 21, 1980.&lt;ref name="act1guide"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sirius.com/servlet/ContentServer?pagename=Sirius/Page&amp;c=FlexContent&amp;cid=1198688730431 |title=The History of Howard Stern Act I Interactive Guide |publisher=Sirius Satellite Radio |date=December 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100907090019/http://www.sirius.com/servlet/ContentServer?pagename=Sirius%2FPage&amp;c=FlexContent&amp;cid=1198688730431 |archivedate=September 7, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He thought of new ways to improve his show and to be more open on the air, "to cut down the barriers ... strip down all the ego ... and be totally honest".{{sfn|Colford|1997|p=57}} His efforts paid off with his first industry recognition, winning a ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Award for Album-Oriented Rock Personality of the Year For a Major Market and the debut Top Five Talent Search contest in the album-oriented rock category from radio syndication firm [[Drake-Chenault]], which then distributed the winning radio segments to stations across the country.{{sfn|Stern|Sloman|1993|p=134}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Billboard's Radio Winners Named|date=August 1, 1981|magazine=Billboard|page=25|volume=93|issue=30|issn=0006-2510|accessdate=February 14, 2010|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ASQEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PT24#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the success, WWWW continued to decline in the ratings and failed to overtake the three more popular rock stations in the area. The quarterly [[Arbitron]] ratings released in January 1981 showed no signs of a strong audience, causing the station to change [[radio format|formats]] overnight from rock to country music, to Stern's surprise and annoyance. He lasted a further two weeks before "it was time to hit the road again. Somehow, I couldn't see myself as Hopalong Howie".{{sfn|Colford|1997|p=61}} He declined offers to work at [[WXRT]] in [[Chicago]] and [[CHUM-FM|CHUM]] in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada.{{sfn|Stern|Sloman|1993|p=134}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stern warning|date=September 4, 1997|first=Jeff|last=Craig|publisher=Jam!|accessdate=August 12, 2010|url=http://jam.canoe.com/Movies/Artists/S/Stern_Howard/1997/09/04/761973.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626234705/http://jam.canoe.com/Movies/Artists/S/Stern_Howard/1997/09/04/761973.html|archivedate=June 26, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1981–1985: WWDC and WNBC ===
Douglas found Stern's next job, hosting mornings at album-oriented rock station [[WWDC (FM)|WWDC]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] Stern was cautious about the offer at first as the general manager "was not really aware of what I did," but accepted the offer and started on March 2, 1981.{{sfn|Colford|1997|p=62, 67}} During his time relocating from Detroit, Stern spent several weeks planning out a new show, determined to become more successful as the station presented a good chance for him to work in New York City, his career goal. He was determined to "kill my competition. I was going to say whatever the fuck I was going to say ... The first step was to put my team together". He sought a co-host with a sense of humor to riff with on news and current events.{{sfn|Stern|Sloman|1993|p=135}} The station then paired Stern with [[Robin Quivers]], a former nurse in the [[United States Air Force|air force]] and news reporter at [[WJZ (AM)|WFBR]] in [[Baltimore]].{{sfn|Colford|1997|p=63}} Quivers was sent a tape of Stern interviewing a prostitute on the air, and accepted the job without meeting him.

In February 1996, production began on a biographical comedy [[Private Parts (1997 film)|film adaptation]] of ''Private Parts'' for [[Paramount Pictures]]. Development had lasted over two years as Stern, who had final script approval, "rejected every script there was ... they were over the top comedies that I think were dumb, boring and dull".

In October 1997, Stern filed a $1.5 million lawsuit against Ministry of Film Inc., claiming the studio recruited him for a film called ''Jane'' starring [[Melanie Griffith]] while knowing it had insufficient funds.

It means that it's going to be different, and they know I'm not going to be giving them any schlock."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/73599/howard-stern-to-remake-rocknroll-high-school|title=Howard Stern To Remake 'Rock'N'Roll' High School|date=November 1, 2002|work=Billboard|accessdate=November 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Development for ''Porky's'' came to a halt in 2011 following legal action regarding the ownership of the film's rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/will-a-legal-fight-ensnare-171863|title=Will a Legal Fight Ensnare Howard Stern's Planned 'Porky's' Remake?

In March 2003, Stern filed a $100 million lawsuit against [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[Telepictures]] and the producers of its reality television series ''[[Are You Hot?]]''. He claimed its premise was copied from a radio show segment of his known as The Evaluators, whereby its staff and guests evaluate the bodies of contestants. Before the show aired, Stern was in talks of producing his version of the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-72558266.html|publisher=Associated Press Online|date=March 14, 2003|via=Highbeam Research|subscription=yes|title=Howard Stern Sues ABC Over 'Are You Hot?'|accessdate=August 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A settlement was reached five months later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-77424430.html|publisher=Associated Press Online|date=August 9, 2003|via=Highbeam Research|subscription=yes|title=Howard Stern Settles 'Are You Hot?'

===2004–2010: Signing with Sirius and terrestrial radio departure===
The [[Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime-show controversy|controversy]] surrounding the [[Super Bowl XXXVIII]] halftime show, aired live on February 1, 2004, led to the government's crackdown on indecency in radio and television following a surge in audience complaints. The situation prompted tighter control over content by station managers which made Stern feel "dead" creatively.&lt;ref name=Kurtz&gt;{{cite news|first=Howard|last=Kurtz|title=Stern On Satellite: A Bruised Flower, Blossoming Anew|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/10/AR2005121001432.html|work=Washington Post|date=December 11, 2005|accessdate=September 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Clear Channel Communications]] and [[Viacom]] were fined for content the FCC deemed indecent; the situation culminated on October 6, 2004, when Stern announced the signing of a five-year deal with [[Sirius Satellite Radio]], a subscription-based [[satellite radio]] service exempt from the FCC's broadcast regulations, starting in 2006. It is a move that has been regarded as the start of "a new era of radio." Stern's final live show on terrestrial airwaves aired on December 16, 2005.

Stern's first contract with Sirius was worth $500 million; a budget of $100 million a year for production, staff, and programming costs. In 2005, he formed two channels, [[Howard 100 and Howard 101]], which launched in September, and formed [[Howard 100 News]], a team of news reporters hired to report daily stories surrounding the radio show and those associated with it. Stern ended his eleven-year association with E! and secured a deal with the [[iN DEMAND]] network to launch [[Howard Stern On Demand]], a digital cable video-on-demand service, to broadcast uncensored tapings of the Sirius radio show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='On Demand' will bare more of Stern footage|first=Richard|last=Huff|date=November 17, 2005|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/demand-bare-stern-footage-article-1.606830|work=New York Daily News|accessdate=July 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The service was relaunched as HowardTV in March 2006 and lasted until it was discontinued in December 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hanging with Howard in his studio|first=Josh|last=Wolk|date=March 31, 2006|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2006/03/31/hanging-howard-his-studio|work=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=July 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new, state-of-the-art studio and office space were constructed for the show at Sirius' headquarters in New York City.&lt;ref name=8k&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.secinfo.com/dsvRa.13ej.htm|title=Sirius Satellite Radio Inc. 8-K For 10/1/04|publisher=SECInfo|date=October 1, 2004|accessdate=March 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 9, 2006, the day of his first broadcast on Sirius, Stern and Buchwald received a total of 34.3 million shares of Sirius stock worth $218 million for exceeding agreed subscriber number targets set when the contract was signed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2006/01/05/news/newsmakers/stern/index.htm|title=Howard Stern &amp; Co.

Between 1990 and 2004, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) fined owners of radio station licensees that carried ''The Howard Stern Show'' a total of $2.5 million for content it considered to be indecent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Indecency on the air|first=John|last=Dunbar|date=April 9, 2004|url=https://www.publicintegrity.org/2004/04/09/6588/indecency-air|publisher=The Center for Public Integrity|accessdate=September 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stern blamed the [[Presidency of George W.

In the early 1970s, Stern's parents began to practice Transcendental Meditation and encouraged him to learn.

Stern revealed his suffering with obsessive–compulsive disorder in ''Miss America''. His condition originated while at university and continued into his radio career.{{sfn|Stern|Sloman|1996|pp=126–127}}
