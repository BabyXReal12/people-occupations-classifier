'''Simon Marc Amstell''' (born 29 November 1979) is an [[English people|English]] [[comedian]], [[television presenter]], [[screenwriter]], [[Television director|director]]  and [[actor]], best known for his roles as former host of ''[[Popworld]]'', former host of ''[[Never Mind the Buzzcocks]]'', co-writer and star of the [[sitcom]] ''[[Grandma's House]]'' and for writing and directing the film 'Carnage'.

==Early years==
Amstell was born in [[Gants Hill]], [[London Borough of Redbridge|Redbridge]], east [[London]] in 1979, to David and Tina (née Leventhal) Amstell. He was brought up in a [[Judaism|Jewish]] family, and he was the eldest of four children. He was educated at [[Beal High School]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Norris|first1=Michelle|title=Feeling free with Simon Amstell|url=http://www.theenquirer.co.uk/feeling-free-with-simon-amstell/|publisher=The Enquirer|accessdate=5 April 2016|date=29 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a state [[comprehensive school]] in [[Ilford]]. His parents' divorce in the early 1990s has been a constant theme throughout his stand-up career, and he says that their decision when he was born to [[circumcise]] him had caused him a sense of great emotional as well as physical loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dipper |first=Andrew |url=http://www.gigglebeats.co.uk/2012/05/simon-amstell-numb-tyne-theatre-newcastle/ |title=Simon Amstell: Numb – Tyne Theatre, Newcastle. |publisher=Giggle Beats |date=2 August 2014 |accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://theater.nytimes.com/2012/07/16/theater/reviews/simon-amstell-performs-comedy-in-numb-at-theater-80.html Sex to Supper: Scrutinizing the Absurd in Social Norms] Publisher: ''[[The New York Times]]''. Written by: Jason Zinoman. Published: 15 July 2012. Retrieved: 3 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Amstell's first television appearance was in 1993 when he appeared as a contestant on the [[Channel 4]] game show ''[[GamesMaster]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/mediamonkeyblog/2008/nov/07/bbc-television |title=Media Monkey: The TV game is kids' stuff for Amstell &amp;#124; Media |publisher=theguardian.com |date=7 November 2008 |accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezCSYdWFTKY Simon Amstell on Gamesmaster, part 1] on [[YouTube]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNQMt9LKQyY Simon Amstell on Gamesmaster, part 2] on YouTube.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994 he appeared on ''[[Good Morning with Anne and Nick]]'' performing an impression of [[Dame Edna Everage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/feature/a524012/simon-cowell-aaron-paul-more-tvs-big-names-before-they-were-famous.html#~p4hAQdzwOKogc8 | title=Simon Cowell, Aaron Paul, more: TV's big names before they were famous | publisher=[[Hearst Corporation]] | work=[[Digital Spy]] | date=17 October 2013 | accessdate=14 February 2015 | author=Gordon, Naomi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also that year, he appeared in an episode of ''[[Family Catchphrase]]'', describing himself as a budding [[Illusionist|magician]] and showing one of his tricks to the show's presenter [[Andrew O'Connor (actor)|Andrew O'Connor]], himself a magician.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BF4bCzSJgsQ Simon Amstell on Family Catchphrase, Part 1] on YouTube.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQSAzxDPdQI Simon Amstell on Family Catchphrase, Part 2] on YouTube.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEYIEfa8gZo Simon Amstell on Family Catchphrase, Part 3] on YouTube.&lt;/ref&gt; Amstell and his family won a television and a video recorder.

Amstell started performing on the comedy circuit when he was in his early teens and later became the youngest finalist to appear in the [[BBC New Comedy Awards]]. His first professional television appearance was in 1998 as a presenter on the UK children's channel [[Nickelodeon UK|Nickelodeon]]. He claims he was sacked for being "sarcastic and mean to children"&lt;ref name=guardian2&gt;{{cite news |url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,,1835165,00.html |title=I always want the funny line (interview) |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=2 August 2006 |accessdate=4 June 2007 |location=London |first=Dorian |last=Lynskey}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the posted biography on his website also, in jest, claims:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"He started his TV career at Nickelodeon where he was fired for making pop stars uncomfortable. He then began presenting the Channel 4 show, ''Popworld''&amp;nbsp;– where he gained a huge following for his groundbreaking work in making pop stars uncomfortable."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.simonamstell.co.uk/who.php ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215025507/http://www.simonamstell.co.uk/who.php |date=15 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===''Popworld''===
From 2000 to 2006, Amstell presented ''[[Popworld]]'' on [[Channel 4]] with [[Miquita Oliver]]. He voiced the characters "Timothy the Popworld melon" and "Richard the Popworld horse" and developed a highly ironic, surreal and [[Out of left field|left-field]] style which gained the show a cult following but angered many of its guests. One example was a mock interview with singer [[Lemar]] called "Lemar From Afar" in which Amstell shouted questions into a megaphone from one end of the world's largest car park while Lemar stood at the other end. Another was a "Si-chiatrist" interview with [[Luke Pritchard]] and [[Hugh Harris (guitarist)|Hugh Harris]] of [[The Kooks]] in which Amstell played the role of psychiatrist and Pritchard and Harris his patients.&lt;ref&gt;[[q:Never Mind the Buzzcocks#18x02|List of Buzzcocks quotes]], Series 18, Episode 2, Quote 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Never Mind the Buzzcocks''===
Amstell first appeared on the comedy show ''[[Never Mind the Buzzcocks]]'' as a guest during [[Mark Lamarr]]'s tenure as host, in 2003 and 2006. Following Lamarr's departure, he was one of the series' guest hosts before being appointed as permanent host beginning in October 2006. He said at the time that he hoped to beat "the universal, exceptionless rule that when a new host takes over an old show it is a horrible, embarrassing disaster".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2006/08_august/23/buzzcocks.shtml |title=Press Office - Simon Amstell is new host of Never Mind the Buzzcocks Buzzcocks |publisher=BBC |date=23 August 2006 |accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2007, Amstell and long-term collaborator Dan Swimer wrote ''Imagine... A Mildly Amusing Panel Show'', a spoof version of [[Alan Yentob]]'s arts programme ''[[Imagine (TV series)|Imagine]]''.  Yentob and Amstell play themselves in a mock interview between what a number of commentators described as "overtly sexual"{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} clips taken from Amstell's ''Never Mind the Buzzcocks'' episodes. It was followed in February 2008 by ''Never Mind the Buzzcocks: A Moving Tribute'', which jokingly implied that Amstell had either died or retired from the show.

On 25 April 2009, Amstell announced via his internet mailing list that he would not be hosting another series of ''Never Mind the Buzzcocks'' because of his desire to concentrate on his live tours and [[stand-up]] performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2009/04/25/8788/amstell_quits_buzzcocks |title=Amstell quits Buzzcocks |publisher=Chortle.co.uk |date=25 April 2009 |accessdate=25 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amstell won several awards for his work on ''Never Mind the Buzzcocks''. In March 2007, he won the 2006 [[Royal Television Society]] Award for ''Best Entertainment Performance''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rts.org.uk/Information_page_+_3_pic_det.asp?id=34868&amp;sec_id=906 ]{{dead link|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2007, he won two [[British Comedy Awards]] for Best Comedy Entertainment Personality and Best Comedy Entertainment Series for ''Never Mind the Buzzcocks''.  In addition, ''Never Mind the Buzzcocks'' won the Best Entertainment Programme&lt;ref name=broadcast&gt;[http://www2.broadcastnow.co.uk/awards/frames.asp]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080119125731/http://www2.broadcastnow.co.uk/awards/frames.asp |date=19 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; award at the Broadcast Awards 2008. Amstell's era was the reason why ''Never Mind the Buzzcocks'' was chosen as the 36th-best TV show of the decade by ''[[The Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article6955835.ece |location=London |work=The Times |first1=Andrew |last1=Billen |first2=David |last2=Chater |title=The top 50 TV shows of the Noughties |date=19 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing and Directing==

===''Grandma's House''===
In 2009, [[BBC2]] commissioned a six-part series titled ''[[Grandma's House]]'' from [[Tiger Aspect Productions]], written by and starring Amstell, co-written by Dan Swimer. The show was commissioned after the airing of a pilot earlier the same year. Filming started in February 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rushton |first=Katherine |url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/news/commissioning/bbc2-greenlights-simon-amstell-sitcom/5006652.article |title=BBC2 greenlights Simon Amstell sitcom &amp;#124; News &amp;#124; Broadcast |publisher=Broadcastnow.co.uk |date=12 October 2009 |accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and broadcasting began in August 2010.

Grandma's House was critically acclaimed and Samantha Spiro, who played 'Liz' won a British Comedy Award.

In April 2012, the second series of ''Grandma's House'' began airing. Amstell announced this would be the last series.

===''Carnage''===

On 19 March 2017, Amstell's ''[[Carnage (2017 film)|Carnage]]'' premiered on [[BBC iPlayer]]. It is set in the year 2067, when the UK is [[vegan]], and older generations are suffering the guilt of their omnivorous past.
