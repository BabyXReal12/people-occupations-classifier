We rely on alcohol to have sex so much. Everyone does. Often in my standup I ask people in the audience who has had sex with someone for the first time when they were stone-cold sober? No one can ever say that they’ve done it! It doesn’t happen! It’s because it’s so uncomfortable, and it’s such a weird thing to do. When I got sober, part of it was because I was having relationships that were based on getting drunk because I couldn’t be intimate with someone unless I was fucked up...I had to get inebriated to do it! And then I’d get into these relationships where I had to be drunk to have sex, and there was no real relationship there. }}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;
