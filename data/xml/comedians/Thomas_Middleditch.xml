==Early life==

He studied at the [[University of Victoria]] before moving to [[Toronto]], where he auditioned for and enrolled in [[George Brown College]], but never attended classes.&lt;ref name="BA"/&gt; He instead opted to make sketches on his own, and worked at a [[New Balance]] store for an income.&lt;ref name="BA"/&gt; He then relocated to [[Chicago]], where he took classes at [[The Second City]] and [[iO Theater]], while also performing regularly.&lt;ref name="BA"/&gt; Due to immigration issues, he worked various cash jobs until [[Charna Halpern]] sponsored him to get his [[Work permit|work visa]].&lt;ref name="BA"/&gt; While performing on a Second City cruise, he got an audition for ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.&lt;ref name="BA"/&gt; Though he did not get cast, the routine he used in his audition landed him a network [[Talent holding deal|holding deal]] and he moved to [[New York City]].&lt;ref name="BA"/&gt;
