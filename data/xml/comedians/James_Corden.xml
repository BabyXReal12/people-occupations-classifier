Corden's first stage appearance was at the age of 18 with a one-line part in the 1996 musical ''[[Martin Guerre (musical)|Martin Guerre]]''.&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt; His first TV reporter role was on the BBC's ''[[Good Morning with Anne and Nick]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/08/james-corden-meat-loaf-interview-1995 Baby James Corden’s 1995 Meat Loaf Interview Is a Delight] ''Vanity Fair''. 23 August 2013.

Corden had guest appearances on ''[[Little Britain]]'' and ''[[Dalziel and Pascoe]]'', both in 2004. Corden's early film credits include ''[[Whatever Happened to Harold Smith?]]'' (1999), [[Mike Leigh]]'s ''[[All or Nothing (film)|All or Nothing]]'' (2002), ''[[Heartlands (film)|Heartlands]]'' (2002), and ''[[Cruise of the Gods]]'' (2002).&lt;ref name="imdb"/&gt;

===Rise to prominence===
From 2000 through early 2005, Corden starred in the British television series ''[[Fat Friends]]'' as Jamie Rymer. He garnered a nomination for the 2000 [[Royal Television Society]] Award for Network Newcomer On Screen for his work. Beginning in 2004, Corden played the role of Timms in the original London stage production of [[Alan Bennett]]'s play ''[[The History Boys]]'', as well as in the [[Broadway (theatre)|Broadway]], Sydney, [[Wellington]] and Hong Kong productions and radio and [[The History Boys (film)|2006 film adaptation]] versions of the play.&lt;ref name="Broadway"/&gt;&lt;ref name="National Theatre"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wellington"/&gt; Also in 2006, he appeared in the film ''[[Starter for 10 (film)|Starter for 10]]''.&lt;ref name="imdb"/&gt;

===Work outside ''Gavin &amp; Stacey''===
During the two year, seven months run of ''Gavin &amp; Stacey'', Corden's professional endeavours outside the successful series proved somewhat chequered.&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;Cochrane, Kira. [https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/oct/02/james-corden-actor-gavin-stacey "James Corden: 'I'm not sure people even think of me as an actor at all'"].

He collaborated again with Horne on a 2009 sketch show named ''[[Horne &amp; Corden]]'', described by the BBC as a "traditional comedy entertainment show in the style of [[Morecambe and Wise]]".&lt;ref name="horne"/&gt; The show ran for only one series and was poorly received by the critics, with Corden later admitting "the absolute truth is I wasn't good enough."&lt;ref name="sketch"/&gt;

In 2009, Corden starred as the lead character in the film ''[[Lesbian Vampire Killers]]'', which was not a success. That year he played [[Clem Cattini]] in the [[Joe Meek]] biopic ''[[Telstar (film)|Telstar]]'', and likewise in the animated ''[[Planet 51]]'' along with Mathew Horne.&lt;ref name="imdb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="horne"/&gt; In February 2009, he co-presented the [[Brit Awards]] with Mathew Horne and [[Kylie Minogue]].&lt;ref name="brit"/&gt; On 13 March 2009, he appeared in a sketch for the UK charity telethon [[Red Nose Day 2009|Comic Relief]] giving the [[England national football team|England football team]] a motivational talk, and later presented a section with Horne showing their best bits of comedy from the previous two years along with highlights from the night.&lt;ref name="horne"/&gt;

In March 2010, Corden began hosting the [[Sky1]] comedy/sports panel show [[A League of Their Own (UK game show)|''A League of Their Own'']] alongside team captains [[Andrew Flintoff]] and [[Jamie Redknapp]]. In March 2010, he presented [[Sport Relief 2010]] alongside [[Davina McCall]] and others, and contributed a "sequel" to the 2009 England football team sketch, this time giving a motivational talk to various sports stars including [[David Beckham]] and motor racing driver [[Jenson Button]].&lt;ref name="sport"/&gt;
