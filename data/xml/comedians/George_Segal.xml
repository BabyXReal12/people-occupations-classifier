'''George Segal''' (born February 13, 1934) is an American actor and musician. Segal became popular in the 1960s and 1970s for playing both dramatic and comedic roles. Some of his most acclaimed roles are in films such as ''[[Ship of Fools (film)|Ship of Fools]]'' (1965), ''[[King Rat (film)|King Rat]]'' (1965), ''[[Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (film)|Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?]]'' (1966), ''[[The St. Valentine's Day Massacre (film)|The St. Valentine's Day Massacre]]'' (1967), ''[[Where's Poppa?]]'' (1970), ''[[The Hot Rock (film)|The Hot Rock]]'' (1972), ''[[Blume in Love]]'' (1973), ''[[A Touch of Class (film)|A Touch of Class]]'' (1973), ''[[California Split]]'' (1974), ''[[For the Boys]]'' (1991), and ''[[Flirting with Disaster (film)|Flirting with Disaster]]'' (1996). He was one of the first American film actors to rise to [[leading man]] status with an unchanged Jewish surname—thus paving the way for [[Dustin Hoffman]] and [[Barbra Streisand]].

He was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] for his performance in ''Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'' and has won two [[Golden Globe Award]]s, including the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Motion Picture Musical or Comedy]] for his performance in ''A Touch of Class''.

On television, he is best known for his roles as Jack Gallo on ''[[Just Shoot Me!]]'' (1997–2003) and as Albert "Pops" Solomon on ''[[The Goldbergs (2013 TV series)|The Goldbergs]]'' (2013–present).

Segal is also an accomplished banjo player. He has released three albums and has also performed the instrument in several of his acting roles and on late night television.

==Early life==
George Segal Jr. was born in [[Great Neck, New York]], to Fannie Blanche Segal (''née'' Bodkin) and George Segal Sr., a malt and hop agent.&lt;ref name="filmref"&gt;{{cite web|title=George Segal Biography (1934-)|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/98/George-Segal.html|work=Film Reference|publisher=Advameg, Inc.|accessdate=26 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-Schlemiel-1971"&gt;{{cite news |last=Klemesrud |first=Judy |title=He's the Great Schlemiel|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1971/01/10/91262424.pdf|accessdate=26 January 2014|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|date=January 10, 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian-FirstAct-2001"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/jul/07/features.weekend | location=London | work=[[The Guardian]] | first=Sally | last=Vincent | title=Return to the first act | date=July 7, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the youngest of four children; oldest brother, John, who worked in the hops brokerage business and was an innovator in the cultivation of new hop varieties,&lt;ref name="NYT-John-obit-2005"&gt;{{cite news|title=Paid Notice: Deaths Segal, John B.|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9502E7D81139F934A35752C0A9639C8B63|accessdate=26 January 2014|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|date=January 7, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; middle brother, Fred, a screenwriter,&lt;ref name="NYT-Schlemiel-1971" /&gt; and a six-year-old sister, Greta, who died of pneumonia before Segal was born.&lt;ref name="JewishJournal-Goldbergs-2013" /&gt;

Segal's family was [[Jewish]], but he was raised in a [[Secularism|secular]] household. A paternal great-grandfather ran for governor of [[Massachusetts]] as a socialist.&lt;ref name="ArtySemite-Forward-2013"&gt;{{cite web|last=Schleier|first=Curt|title=The Arty Semite: George Segal on 'The Goldbergs' and Playing Pops Solomon |url=http://blogs.forward.com/the-arty-semite/184063/george-segal-on-the-goldbergs-and-playing-pops-sol/|work=[[The Forward]]|publisher=The Forward Association, Inc.|accessdate=26 January 2014|date=September 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked if he had a bar mitzvah, Segal stated: "I'm afraid not. I went to a Passover Seder at [[Groucho Marx]]'s once and he kept saying, 'When do we get to the wine?' So that's my Jewish experience. I went to a friend's bar mitzvah, and that was the only time I was in Temple Beth Shalom. Jewish life wasn't happening that much at the time. People's car tires were slashed in front of the temple. I was once kicked down a flight of stairs by some kids from the local parochial school".&lt;ref name="ArtySemite-Forward-2013" /&gt;

All four of Segal's grandparents were [[Russians|Russian]] immigrants.&lt;ref name="JewishJournal-Goldbergs-2013"&gt;{{cite web|last=Pfefferman|first=Naomi|title=George Segal on ABC’s ‘The Goldbergs,’ ‘Where’s Poppa?’ and playing Jewish|url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/the_ticket/item/george_segal_on_abcs_the_goldbergs_wheres_poppa_and_playing_jewish|work=Jewish Journal|publisher=Tribe Media Corp.|accessdate=26 January 2014|date=August 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Susskind-JewishSon-1970"&gt;{{cite web|title=How to be a Jewish Son—or—My Son the Success! |url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/video/article/video_the_david_susskind_show_1970_how_to_be_a_jewish_son_20081202/ |work= [[David Susskind Show]]|accessdate=26 January 2014|page=Season 12 :  Ep. 7|format=video|year=1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; His maternal grandparents changed their surname from Slobodkin to Bodkin.&lt;ref name="JewishJournal-Goldbergs-2013" /&gt; He first became interested in acting at the age of nine, when he saw [[Alan Ladd]] in ''[[This Gun for Hire]]''.&lt;ref name="Guardian-FirstAct-2001" /&gt; He states: "I started off with the ukulele when I was a kid in Great Neck. A friend had a red Harold Teen model; it won my heart. When I got to high school, I realized you couldn't play in a band with a ukulele, so I moved on to the four-string banjo."&lt;ref name="ChiTrib-Banjo-1993" /&gt;

When his father died in 1947, Segal moved to [[New York City]] with his mother.&lt;ref name="TCM-timeline"&gt;{{cite web|title=Overview for George Segal - Milestones |url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/person/173627%7C59401/George-Segal/|work=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|publisher=Turner Sports and Entertainment Digital Network|accessdate=26 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from [[George School]] in 1951, and attended [[Haverford College]].&lt;ref name="IGAS"&gt;Segal, George.

== Career ==

Originally a stage actor and musician, Segal appeared in several minor films in the early 1960s in addition to the well-known [[World War II]] film ''[[The Longest Day (film)|The Longest Day]]'' (1962).

Segal famously pulled out of the lead role in [[Blake Edwards]]' hit comedy ''[[10 (film)|10]]'' (1979)&lt;ref name="NYT-JustShoot-1998"/&gt; and, with a few exceptions in films such as ''[[Carbon Copy (film)|Carbon Copy]]'' (1981),  subsequently received fewer prominent roles in the 1980s. Near the end of the decade, however, Segal began to reestablish himself as a successful character actor and has since performed in supporting roles in a number of prominent films, including ''[[Look Who's Talking]]'' (1989), ''[[For the Boys]]'' (1991), ''[[To Die For]]'' (1995), ''[[The Mirror Has Two Faces]]'' (1996), ''[[Flirting with Disaster (film)|Flirting with Disaster]]'' (1996), ''[[The Cable Guy]]'' (1996)'', [[2012 (film)|2012]]'' (2009), and ''[[Love &amp; Other Drugs]]'' (2010).

In the 1970s and 1980s, Segal appeared frequently on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'', nine times as a guest and once as a guest host. His appearances were marked by eccentric banter with [[Johnny Carson]] and were usually punctuated by bursts of banjo playing.&lt;ref name="NYT-JustShoot-1998" /&gt; In 1976, Segal co-hosted the [[Academy Awards]].

Beginning in the 1980s, Segal began to appear in a number of television films and starred in a couple of short lived sitcoms, while also guest starring in shows such as ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'' and ''[[The Larry Sanders Show]]''.

From 1997 to 2003, however, Segal had his most prominent role in years when he starred in the [[National Broadcasting Company|NBC]] sitcom ''[[Just Shoot Me!]]'' as [[Jack Gallo]], the owner and publisher of a New York City fashion magazine.&lt;ref name="NYT-JustShoot-1998"&gt;{{cite news|last=Meisler|first=Andy|title=Television; Out of the Polyester Past, a Comic Rogue Returns|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/04/arts/television-out-of-the-polyester-past-a-comic-rogue-returns.html|accessdate=26 January 2014|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|date=January 4, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was nominated for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Television Series Musical or Comedy]] in 1999 and 2000 as well as a [[Satellite Awards|Satellite Award]] in 2002 for this part.

He played with a dixieland jazz band while in college at Columbia that had several different names. When he booked a gig, he would bill the group as Bruno Lynch and his Imperial Jazzband. The group, which later settled on the name Red Onion Jazz Band, later played at his first wedding.&lt;ref name="IGAS"/&gt;

In the Army, his band was called Corporal Bruno's Sad Sack Six.&lt;ref name="ChiTrib-Banjo-1993"/&gt;

In 1967, Segal released his debut LP, ''The Yama Yama Man''. The title track is a [[ragtime]] version of the 1908 tune "[[The Yama Yama Man]]" with horns and banjos. Segal released the album at a time when he appeared regularly playing banjo on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]''.&lt;ref name="ChiTrib-Banjo-1993"&gt;{{cite news|last=Terry|first=Clifford|title=Banjo Pickin' With George Segal|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1993-04-02/features/9304020150_1_banjo-string-sing|accessdate=January 26, 2014|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=April 2, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, he played in ''A Touch of Ragtime'', an album with his band, the Imperial Jazzband. During the 1970s and 1980s he made frequent television appearances with the "Beverly Hills Unlisted Jazz Band", whose members included actor [[Conrad Janis]] on trombone. In 1981, they performed live at [[Carnegie Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Marx|first=Linda|title=With a Touch of Brash, George Segal Finally Plays the Big Time|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20079623,00.html|accessdate=January 26, 2014|newspaper=[[People (magazine)|People]]|date=June 29, 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent engagements in Los Angeles have included guest spots with the award-winning residency Guitarology.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

In addition to playing banjo while appearing on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'', Segal has played the instrument in several of his acting roles, including several episodes of ''The Goldbergs''.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

In 2005, Segal played Dr. Dreck, a [[Jewish]] rapper, in the short film ''Chutzpah, This Is'', although he did not perform his own raps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forward.com/news/israel/1722/more-jewish-rap-that-e2-80-99s-chutzpah|title=More Jewish Rap?

== Personal life ==
Segal has been married three times.
