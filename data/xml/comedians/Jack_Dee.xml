'''James Andrew Innes "Jack" Dee''' (born 29 September 1961) is an English [[stand-up comedian]], actor and writer known for his sarcasm and [[deadpan]] humour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/4708870/Mr-Deadpan-loosens-up.html|title=Mr Deadpan loosens up|last=Bassett|first=Kate|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=24 May 1997|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is well known in the United Kingdom for writing and starring in the sitcom ''[[Lead Balloon]]'' and hosting the panel show ''[[I'm Sorry I Haven't A Clue]]''.

He has been a team captain on ''[[Shooting Stars (TV series)|Shooting Stars]]'' and hosted ''[[Live at the Apollo (TV series)|Jack Dee: Live at the Apollo]]'', which was nominated for a BAFTA in 2006. He also presented ''The Jack Dee Show'', ''Jack Dee's Saturday Night'' and ''Jack Dee's Happy Hour''. He won ''[[Celebrity Big Brother 1 (UK)|Celebrity Big Brother 1]]'' in 2001.

==Early life and education==
Jack Dee was the youngest of three children born to Rosemary A. ([[married and maiden names|née]] Stamper) and Geoffrey T. Dee, after Joanna Innes Dee and David Simon Innes Dee. Jack was born in [[Bromley]], [[Kent]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?cite=X0W2nYTQziJ76AG%2BJ4teNQ&amp;scan=1|title=Index entry|accessdate=7 August 2016|work=FreeBMD|publisher=ONS}}&lt;/ref&gt; and grew up in nearby [[Petts Wood]]&lt;ref name=comedycv&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/guide/talent/d/dee_jack.shtml BBC Comedy Guide: Jack Dee]; accessed 14 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; before moving with his family to [[Winchester]] when he was young. His father, Geoffrey, was a printer and his mother, Rosemary, was the daughter of two unsuccessful repertory actors, Henry Lionel Pope Stamper (1906–1985) and Edna May Howard Innes (1904–1969).&lt;ref&gt;Dee, Jack. ''Thanks For Nothing''. [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]], 2009, pp. 133-34, 171.&lt;!--ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Dee was educated at both [[independent school (United Kingdom)|independent]] and state schools. His first school, [[The Pilgrims' School]], a preparatory school in Winchester, was followed by the state [[Kings' School|Montgomery of Alamein School]] for his secondary education, and for a period he attended [[Frensham Heights School]]. He took his [[GCE Advanced Level|A-levels]] at [[Peter Symonds' College]], and left with a D and an F grade. Following this, he planned to attend drama college, but his plans were scuppered when his mother persuaded him to get a vocation, and so he entered the catering industry and became a [[waiter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Lucy|last=Cavendish|title=Now I don't need to be drunk to be happy|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/starinterviews/article-23371763-now-i-dont-need-to-be-drunk-to-be-happy.do|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120525160640/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/starinterviews/article-23371763-now-i-dont-need-to-be-drunk-to-be-happy.do|dead-url=yes|archive-date=25 May 2012|newspaper=[[Evening Standard]]|date=23 October 2006|accessdate=17 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
{{BLP sources section|date=November 2016}}
Dee's first public act was an open-mic gig in 1986 at [[The Comedy Store, London|The Comedy Store]], which he went to one evening after work.&lt;ref&gt;Different sources give different dates for the open-mike gig, with some saying 1986, some 1987 and some 1988. An interview with ''The Times'' in 2004 states 1987. [http://www.chortle.co.uk/comics/j/159/jack_dee?PHPSESSID=336900134e6576a6a16c69f719cc93c8 ''Chortle''] gives 1986 and 1988 on the same page. His biography at ''Off The Kerb'', which represents him, gives it as 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; He was encouraged to write additional material and to tour the circuit.

Since the 1990s he has performed sell-out acts at many high-profile venues (including the [[London Palladium]] and the [[Hammersmith Apollo]]). After he scooped the [[British Comedy Award]] for Best Stage Newcomer in 1991, Dee was offered his own show; ''The Jack Dee Show'' first went out on [[Channel 4]] in February 1992, bringing him to a wider audience. His combination of stand-up routines on television continued with ''Jack Dee's Saturday Night'' on ITV, ''Jack Dee's Happy Hour'' in 1997 and later ''[[Live at the Apollo (TV series)|Jack Dee Live at the Apollo]]'' in 2004 on [[BBC One]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

In 1996, he starred alongside [[Jeremy Hardy]] in ''[[Jack and Jeremy's Real Lives]]'', a collection of mockumentaries similar to their previous collaboration, ''Jack And Jeremy's Police 4''. Each episode would focus on the pair playing bizarre characters from a particular profession. Shot on film and featuring no laugh track, the show failed to catch on. After three episodes it was moved to air after midnight. The pilot featured [[Sacha Baron Cohen]] being electrocuted. Aside from his successful stand-up career, Dee has played starring roles and guest appearances in television series. He played the part of Doug Digby in [[Pilot (The Grimleys)|the ''Grimleys'' pilot]] (1997) before the role was recast for [[The Grimleys|the series]], and made guest appearances on such programmes as ''[[Silent Witness]]'', ''[[Dalziel and Pascoe (TV series)|Dalziel and Pascoe]]'' and ''[[Jonathan Creek]]''.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

In 2001, he won ''[[Celebrity Big Brother 1 (UK)|Celebrity Big Brother]]'' (then linked to fundraising for [[Comic Relief]]). During evictions, he dressed up in a tweed jacket and cap and held his packed suitcase, hoping to be voted out. During the eviction of another housemate he briefly absconded to sneak a quick kiss with his wife. He also escaped for several hours at night-time. He has subsequently said that he dislikes the treatment of the housemates by the show and its producers, and has refused all permission for any of the clips to be shown again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people=Jack Dee, Mark Lawson|title=Mark Lawson Talks to Jack Dee|medium=TV-series|publisher=BBC Four|date=3 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, he played the role of Steven Sharples [[Member of Parliament|MP]] the self-styled 'Deputy Home Secretary' alongside [[Warren Clarke]] and [[Dervla Kirwan]] in ''The Deputy''. Dee's performance was praised, though the film itself received a lukewarm response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Kathryn|last=Flett|title=The ups and downs of pros and cons|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,,1158696,00.html|work=[[The Observer]]|date=29 February 2004|accessdate=14 August 2006|location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year he starred in another one-off drama, ''Tunnel of Love''. He was the celebrity advocate in ''[[Britain's Best Sitcom]]'' for ''[[Fawlty Towers]]'' and presented an hour-long documentary about the series.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

In 2005, he co-hosted ''Comic Aid'', a one-off gathering of comedians that aimed to raise money for the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|Asian Tsunami]] Appeal. In May of the same year he appeared on the "[[Star in a Reasonably-Priced Car (Top Gear)|Star in a Reasonably-Priced Car]]" segment of the [[BBC Two]] series ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]'', achieving a lap time of 1:53.5 (52nd on the [[Suzuki Liana]] leader board). His most recent series ''[[Lead Balloon]]'', which he also co-wrote, began on [[BBC Four]] on 4 October 2006. Described as "Britain's answer to ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]''",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Ciar|last=Byrne|title=Dee writes BBC's answer to "Curb Your Enthusiasm"|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/media/article341031.ece|work=[[The Independent]]|date=26 January 2006|accessdate=14 August 2006|location=London, UK|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060914041740/http://news.independent.co.uk/media/article341031.ece|archivedate=14 September 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Lead Balloon]]'' sees Dee play the semi-biographical role of [[Rick Spleen]]. A second series of eight episodes was commissioned and was broadcast on [[BBC Two]] in 2007, with a third series debuting on Thursday 13 November 2008. A fourth series finished on the BBC on 5 July 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/TheRealJackDee/status/17928563932008448|title=Jack Dee on Twitter|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also starred as Harry in the 2005 film ''[[Short Order]]''.

In February 2009, it was announced that Dee would be one of a trio of hosts to replace the late [[Humphrey Lyttelton]] for the summer series of ''[[I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue]]'' (the others being [[Stephen Fry]] and [[Rob Brydon]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/broadcasting/a147836/fry-brydon-dee-to-host-clue-return.html|title=Fry, Brydon, Dee to host 'Clue' return|date=25 February 2009|publisher=digitalspy.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently became the permanent host from the 52nd series onwards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8311305.stm Jack Dee to host Radio 4's Clue], bbc.co.uk; accessed 5 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; He is also a frequent guest on ''[[QI]]'' and ''[[Have I Got News for You]]'', which he has guest-presented ten times, and he hosts segments of the BBC's biennial [[Comic Relief (charity)|Comic Relief]] telethon. He starred in advertisements for [[John Smith's Brewery|John Smith's Bitter]] in the 1990s, becoming known as "the midget with the widget". He made his stage debut in 1998, playing Yvan in [[Yasmina Reza]]'s [[Laurence Olivier Awards|Olivier award]]-winning ''[['Art' (play)|'Art']]''. He later returned as Serge for a 13-week run at the request of the director.&lt;ref name="comedycv"/&gt;

In 2008, Dee took part in the 15th anniversary special of ''[[Shooting Stars (TV series)|Shooting Stars]]'' where he replaced [[Will Self]] as captain of Team A. The show aired on 30 December 2008 on [[BBC2]]. Dee returned as team captain in series 6 of ''Shooting Stars'' on 26 August 2009, and again for the 7th series. Over Christmas 2009, Dee played the role of John Tweedledum in ''[[The News at Bedtime]]''.{{cn|date=June 2017}}

In 2010, Dee took part in ''[[Channel 4's Comedy Gala]]'', a [[Benefit concert|benefit show]] held in aid of [[Great Ormond Street Hospital|Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital]], filmed live at the [[The O2 Arena (London)|O2 Arena]] in London on 30 March. In 2013, Dee joined [[Dara Ó Briain]], [[Chelsee Healey]], [[Greg James]], [[Mel C]] and [[Philips Idowu]] in ''Through Hell and High Water'', a Comic Relief challenge which involved British celebrities canoeing the most difficult rapids of the [[Zambezi River]]. They raised more than £1 million for the charity.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

==Personal life==
Dee met Susan Jane Hetherington in 1986, when he was working as a waiter in [[Fulham]] and she was a receptionist at a nearby hotel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/comedy/6615666/The-unshine-boy-Jack-Dee-interview.html#|title=The unshine boy: Jack Dee interview|last=Farndale|first=Nigel|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=Telegraph Media Group|accessdate=19 March 2011|location=London|date=23 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; They married in [[Winchester (borough)|Winchester]], [[Hampshire]], in 1989.&lt;ref name="FunnyFella"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bbcentertainment.com/nordic/programmes/liveattheapollo/facts/|title=There's more to funny fella Jack Dee than just deadpan wit.|last=Barfoot|first=Paul|work=[[BBC Entertainment]]|publisher=BBC|accessdate=19 March 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110503222115/http://bbcentertainment.com/nordic/programmes/liveattheapollo/facts|archivedate=3 May 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together, they have four children.&lt;ref name="FunnyFella"/&gt;

Dee suffers from [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], and he has claimed that his work is the best therapy for his condition, saying "if you have the impulse to be creative, you ignore it at your peril".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/comedy/6615666/The-unshine-boy-Jack-Dee-interview.html The unshine boy: Jack Dee interview], telegraph.co.uk; accessed 5 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his twenties, Dee worked at [[The Ritz London Hotel|the Ritz]] in London and started drinking heavily. He attended church and attempted to become a [[priest]]. After he realised that was not for him he gave it up, and never quit drinking, although he would later describe his condition as "[[alcohol abuse]]" rather than [[alcoholism]], which was the diagnosis at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Penny|last=Wark|title=Jack Dee: a seriously funny man|work=[[The Times]]|date=8 March 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1990s, he has advertised [[John Smith's Brewery|John Smith's Bitter]], becoming known as "the midget with the widget".
Following his appearance on ''Celebrity Big Brother'', he had a relapse, though did not attend [[Alcoholics Anonymous|AA]] meetings because he did not want paparazzi photographing him leaving the meetings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Andrew|last=Billen|title=Politics?

In 2007, the ''[[Daily Express]]'' reported that he was in negotiations with publishers to release his [[autobiography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Kathryn|last=Spencer|title=Jack's back in bid to sell his life story|work=Daily Express|date=4 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He signed with [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] in 2008 and the book, ''Thanks For Nothing: The Jack Dee Memoirs'', was released in October 2009, along with an audiobook of the same title which he narrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2008/04/12/6626/its_his_autobiograp-dee|title=It's his autobiograph-Dee|date=4 December 2008|publisher=[[Chortle]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Dee, "it's really the story of how I got into comedy... It's kind of an autobiography but isn't, as it stops about 25 years ago. It goes right up to the first time I do stand up."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/comedy/2009/05/hignfy-guest-host-interview-ja.shtml|title=HIGNFY Guest Host interview: Jack Dee|publisher=BBC Comedy Blog|date=8 May 2009|last=Thair|first=David}}&lt;/ref&gt;
