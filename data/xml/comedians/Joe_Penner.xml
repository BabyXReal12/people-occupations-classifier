'''Joe Penner''' (November 11, 1904 – January 10, 1941) was an American 1930s-era vaudeville, radio and film comedian.

==Emigration to America==
Recorded as Josef Pinter on the steerage manifest of the [[RMS Slavonia|RMS ''Slavonia'']], sailing from [[Fiume]], Italy, May 4, and arriving at the Port of New York on May 23, 1907, the future comedian was accompanied by his sister, Maria, and their guardian, Istvan Molnar. They settled in [[Elkhart, Indiana]].

==Vaudeville and Burlesque==
Joe Penner first made his mark in local entertainments in Indiana and, thanks to his clowning and "Wanna Buy a Duck?" routine, he was soon in small-time burlesque and vaudeville. A high point came when he performed in the ''Greenwich Village Follies'' in Chicago in 1926. After this break, he toured in mainstream vaudeville until its gradual demise around 1932.

==Radio==
Penner developed his catch phrases in burlesque. In 1932 he toured in a vaudeville revue with [[Eddie Tamblyn]], father of actor Russ Tamblyn. He was launched on his successful radio career by [[Rudy Vallée]], appearances which led to his own Sunday evening half-hour, ''[[The Baker's Broadcast]]'', which began on the [[Blue Network]] October 8, 1933. Penner was a zany comic, noted for his famed [[catchphrase]], "Wanna buy a duck?", and his low hyuck-hyuck laugh. Penner's other memorable catchphrase, often triggered by someone else's [[double entendre]] remark, was, "You ''naaaasss''-ty man!" &lt;br&gt;He was voted radio's top comedian in 1934, but a 1935 dispute with the ad agency over the show's format resulted in Penner quitting ''The Baker's Broadcast'' on June 30, 1935. ''[[Vox Pop (radio)|Vox Pop]]'' began as a summer replacement series for Penner in 1935. A year later, he returned with ''The Joe Penner Show'', which began airing October 4, 1936 on [[CBS]], sponsored by Cocomalt, with Harry Conn as his new head writer.&lt;ref name="Young"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jordan Young|title=Writing for Jack Benny and Joe Penner: Interviews with Comedy Writers|url=https://www.amazon.com/Writing-Jack-Benny-Joe-Penner-ebook/dp/B00R2FEJ1W/|date=2014|publisher=Amazon Digital Services, Inc|pages=1-57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Films==
[[File:Riggspenner.jpg|right|thumb|350px|NBC brought together (l to r) [[Bob Burns (comedian)|Bob Burns]], [[Tommy Riggs and Betty Lou|Tommy Riggs]], Charlie McCarthy, [[Edgar Bergen]], [[Rudy Vallée]] and Joe Penner.]]Penner's films include ''[[College Rhythm]]'' (1934), ''[[New Faces of 1937]]'' (1937), "[[Mr. Doodle Kicks Off]]" (1938),''[[The Day the Bookies Wept]]'' (1939) and ''[[Millionaire Playboy]]'' (1940). He was caricatured by [[Tex Avery]] and [[Friz Freleng]] in the musical cartoon, "[[My Green Fedora]]", ''"Can You Take It?"'' a "Popeye the Sailor" cartoon (Max Fleischer for Paramount), and several pictures starring the bumbling stooge [[Egghead (Looney Tunes)|Egghead]]. He also made a [[cameo appearance|cameo]] in the [[Disney]] cartoon "[[Mother Goose Goes Hollywood]]" in which he says, "Wanna buy a duck?", and then shows [[Donald Duck]] on a [[Plate (dishware)|plate]].


After covering the 1932–34 rise of [[Jack Pearl]], [[Elizabeth McLeod]] summed up Penner's popularity:&lt;blockquote&gt;The ultimate Depression-era zany was Joe Penner. A forgotten performer today to most, and little more than a footnote to the average OTR [old-time radio] fan, Penner was a national craze in 1933–34.  There is no deep social meaning in his comedy, no shades of subtlety — just utter slapstick foolishness, delivered in an endearingly simpering style that's the closest thing the 1930s had to [[Pee-wee Herman]]. An added attraction was Penner's in-character singing each week of a whimsical novelty song, specially written to suit his style. Like Pearl, however, Penner was doomed to early decline by the sheer repetitiveness of his format, even though he remained very popular with children right up to the end of his radio career.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.midcoast.com/~lizmcl/rfy.html McLeod, Elizabeth. "Radio's Forgotten Years: Tuning Thru the Great Depression," 1998.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303235626/http://www.midcoast.com/~lizmcl/rfy.html |date=2009-03-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Part of the reason for Penner's relative obscurity in modern times is the lack of surviving recordings of Penner's work. His radio show aired in the early 1930s; widespread recording of popular radio shows began in 1936, just as his show was ending.

==Personal life==
He was an ethnic Hungarian born as '''József Pintér''' in [[Zrenjanin|Nagybecskerek]], [[Austria-Hungary]] (in what is present-day [[Zrenjanin]], [[Serbia]]). He passed through [[Ellis Island]] as a child when his family emigrated to America. In 1928, he married showgirl Eleanor May Vogt (1908&amp;ndash;1946).&lt;ref name=mwotrc&gt;http://www.mwotrc.com/rr2009_02/penner.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Penner died in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania, in 1941, aged 36.&lt;ref name=mwotrc/&gt;
