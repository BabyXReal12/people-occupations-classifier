'''Gerald David "Lorenzo" Music''' (May 2, 1937 – August 4, 2001) was an American actor, voice actor, writer, producer and musician.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/08/08/arts/lorenzo-music-actor-64.html| work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Lorenzo Music – Actor, 64| agency=[[Associated Press]]| date=August 8, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was best known as the original voice of [[Jim Davis (cartoonist)|Jim Davis]]' comic strip cat [[Garfield (character)|Garfield]] on animated projects during the 1980s.

==Early life==
Music was born in [[Brooklyn, New York]] and raised in [[Duluth, Minnesota]], where he was educated at [[Central High School (Duluth, Minnesota)|Central High School]] and the [[University of Minnesota Duluth]].  Music's family moved to Minnesota around 1943 due to his father getting a job at one of the shipyards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Lorenzo Music |url=http://zenithcity.com/archive/people-biography/lorenzo-music/ |website=Zenith City |publisher=Zenith City |accessdate=5 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He met his wife Henrietta at the latter, and together they formed a comedy duo named Gerald and His Hen. They performed successfully together for eight years. He changed his first name to Lorenzo for spiritual reasons after he became a member of the international spiritual association [[Subud]].&lt;ref name=subud&gt;[http://www.retrojunk.com/article/show/1253/lorenzo-music "Lorenzo Music: The Life and Career of the Man Who Voiced Garfield the Cat."] ''www.retrojunk.com.'' Retrieved February 1, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===Early work (1962–1981)===
Music became a writer and a regular performer on ''[[The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour]]'' during 1968 and 1969. His work as a writer on ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'' in 1970 would lead him to his big break.

He was the co-creator of ''[[The Bob Newhart Show]]'' (with his then-producer/writing partner [[David Davis (TV producer)|David Davis]]) which went on the air in 1972 and ran for six years; he also co-wrote the theme song to the show with his wife Henrietta.  Music continued writing for the ''Mary Tyler Moore Show'' spin-off ''[[Rhoda]]''. While casting ''Rhoda'', the producers were looking for a voice actor to play the part of a character that would be heard but never seen: Carlton the doorman. When they heard Music's sleepy, husky voice, they offered him that role, which made his voice recognizable to a worldwide television audience. The character was popular enough to warrant a one-off single in 1975 called "Who Is It?" (b/w "The Girl in 510", [[United Artists Records|United Artists]] UA-XW643-X), which became a regional hit. Music also co-produced and co-wrote a 1980 animated special ''[[Carlton Your Doorman]]'' which won an [[Emmy Award]].

In 1976, he and Henrietta were given the opportunity to host a syndicated television variety show of their own. ''The Lorenzo and Henrietta Music Show'' was produced at a time when there was a glut of television variety shows, and it did not last.

In 1983, Music voiced the character Ralph the All-Purpose Animal in the stop-motion animated film ''[[Twice Upon a Time (1983 film)|Twice Upon A Time]]''.

===Garfield (1982–1994)===
{{Main|Garfield}}
In 1982, [[Jim Davis (cartoonist)|Jim Davis]]'s ''[[Garfield]]'' was the most popular [[comic strip]] in [[United States|America]]. Compilation books and merchandising of the strip were topping best seller lists, and Davis was negotiating to make an animated television special. Producers needed someone to voice the main character in the strip: Garfield, a fat, lazy, oafish and demanding cat. The audition attracted several famed vocal talents, including [[Sterling Holloway]], the voice of [[Winnie the Pooh]]. After one audition, Music was immediately cast as the voice of Garfield; in Davis's words, "I looked at the room full of [voice] actors, and then in the corner I saw Lorenzo, quietly licking himself". Music would serve as the voice of Garfield in more than 12 television specials and in the ''[[Garfield and Friends]]'' animated television series that ran from 1988-1994. 

===Other voice work===
Music voiced characters for shows such as ''[[TaleSpin]]'' as Sgt. Dunder, ''[[The Real Ghostbusters]]'', ''[[Disney's Adventures of the Gummi Bears]]'' as Tummi Gummi, ''[[Fluppy Dogs]]'' as Ozzie the Green Cool Fluppy, ''[[Pac-Man (TV series)|Pac-Man]]'', ''[[Pound Puppies]]'' as Teensy in the season 2 episode ''Little Big Dog'', and ''[[Darkwing Duck]]''. In the mid-1990s, after ''[[Garfield and Friends]]'', ''[[Darkwing Duck]]'' and ''[[Disney's Adventures of the Gummi Bears]]'' concluded, Music retired from cartoon voice acting.

During the 1980s, Music also did voice-overs for many commercials for prime-time TV, such as Larry the Crash Test Dummy in the "You Could Learn a Lot from a Dummy" public safety announcements sponsored by the [[U.S. Department of Transportation]] and for Florida grapefruit juice, a lesser known series of commercials extolling Florida agriculture as opposed to the more popular "Florida orange juice" commercials.

In keeping with his beliefs in Subud and emphasis on charity, Music frequently volunteered his time on a [[suicide hotline]]. Music recalled that sometimes a caller would change his tone: "I am bankrupt, my wife ran off with another man...Hey, you sound just like that cat on TV!"&lt;ref name="evanier"&gt;{{cite web| last1=Evanier| first1=Mark| title=Lorenzo Music, R.I.P.| url=http://www.newsfromme.com/2001/08/05/lorenzo-music-r-i-p/| website=News From Me| author-link=Mark Evanier| date=August 5, 2001| accessdate=March 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later years (1995–2001)===
In 1996, Music's voice could be heard on [[Stan Freberg]]'s ''Stan Freberg Presents the United States of America Volume Two'' album, released as a CD by [[Rhino Entertainment|Rhino Records]]. Music appears on the album as [[James Madison]] and [[Robert E. Lee]]. Music also appeared as an intercom announcer on an episode of ''[[The Drew Carey Show]]''.

In the early 1990s, he served as the voice-over for commercials for Ore Ida Potatoes and Fruit and Cream Strawberry Twinkies. He later served as the pitchman for Ruggles [[Ice Cream]] (a local brand from [[Orrville, Ohio]]).

Music continued his role of Garfield for commercials and several PC games, such as ''[[Garfield's Mad About Cats]]'', through the 1990s and early 2000s.

His last appearance as the voice of [[Garfield]] was for an automobile commercial in 2001.

==Personal life and death==
Music was married to composer/writer Henrietta Music; together they have four children.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Lorenzo Music; Voice of Garfield the Cat| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/aug/08/local/me-31716| date=August 8, 2001| first=Myrna| last=Oliver| work=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Music died from complications related to [[lung cancer|lung]] and [[Osteosarcoma|bone cancer]] on August 4, 2001. He was [[cremated]] and his ashes were scattered at sea. He was survived by his wife Henrietta and their four children.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

==Legacy==
Since Music's death, [[Frank Welker]] has often replaced him as the voice of Garfield in recent productions of the ''Garfield'' franchise including three fully-CGI films: ''[[Garfield Gets Real]]'', ''[[Garfield's Fun Fest]]'', and ''[[Garfield's Pet Force]]'' and the CGI animated series, ''[[The Garfield Show]]''. Also, [[Bill Murray]] was chosen to voice Garfield in the live-action/animated films ''[[Garfield: The Movie]]'' and ''[[Garfield: A Tail of Two Kitties]]''. Music voiced Murray's character of Doctor Peter Venkman in ''[[The Real Ghostbusters]]''.  Meanwhile, Frank Welker also provided the voice of [[Ray Stantz]] on ''The Real Ghostbusters''.
