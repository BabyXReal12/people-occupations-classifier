'''Michael Edward Palin''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|CBE|FRGS}} (pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|eɪ|l|ᵻ|n}}; born 5 May 1943)&lt;ref name=whoswho&gt;{{Who's Who | surname = PALIN | othernames = Michael Edward | id = U29929 | volume = 2015 | edition = online [[Oxford University Press]]}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an English comedian, actor, writer and television presenter.  He was a member of the comedy group [[Monty Python]] and later made a number of [[Travel documentary|travel documentaries]].

Palin wrote most of his comedic material with fellow Python member [[Terry Jones]]. Before Monty Python, they had worked on other shows such as the ''[[Ken Dodd]] Show'', ''[[The Frost Report]]'', and ''[[Do Not Adjust Your Set]]''. Palin appeared in some of the most famous Python sketches, including "[[Argument Clinic]]", "[[Dead Parrot sketch]]", "[[The Lumberjack Song]]", "[[The Spanish Inquisition (Monty Python)|The Spanish Inquisition]]", "[[Bicycle Repair Man]]" and "[[The Fish-Slapping Dance]]".

Palin continued to work with Jones after Python, co-writing ''[[Ripping Yarns]]''. He has also appeared in several films directed by fellow Python [[Terry Gilliam]] and made notable appearances in other films such as ''[[A Fish Called Wanda]]'' (1988), for which he won the [[BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role]].&lt;ref name="BAFTA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://awards.bafta.org/award/1989/film/actor-in-a-supporting-role|title=Film - Actor in a Supporting Role in 1989|publisher=BAFTA|accessdate=11 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2005 poll to find ''The Comedians' Comedian'', he was voted the 30th favourite by fellow comedians and comedy insiders.&lt;ref&gt;[https://movies.yahoo.com/person/michael-palin/ Michael Palin Biography] Yahoo.com.

After Python, he began a new career as a [[travel writer]] and travel documentarian. His journeys have taken him across the world, including the [[North Pole|North]] and [[South Pole]]s, the [[Sahara Desert]], the [[Himalayas]], Eastern Europe and [[Brazil]]. In 2000 Palin was honoured as a [[Order of the British Empire|Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE) for his services to television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/584037.stm | title = Trio of Dames lead showbiz honours |work=BBC News |date = 31 December 1999 | accessdate=15 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2009 to 2012 Palin was the president of the [[Royal Geographical Society]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rgs.org/AboutUs/People/People.htm People &amp; Staff] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120615115333/http://www.rgs.org/AboutUs/People/People.htm |date=15 June 2012 }} Royal Geographical Society.

Despite the age gap the two had a close relationship until her suicide in 1987.&lt;ref name="ind120729"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Basil|last=Pao|url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/stdn/std/World/FJ23Wd06.html |title=The wandering man |work=[[The Standard (newspaper)|The Weekend Standard]] |publisher=Sing Tao Newspaper Group and Global China Group|location=Hong Kong|date=23-24 October 2004 |accessdate=1 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522082137/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/stdn/std/World/FJ23Wd06.html |archivedate=22 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has ancestral roots in [[Letterkenny]], [[County Donegal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Seán P. |last=Feeny|url=http://donegalnews.com/2013/03/first-letterkenny-heritage-magazine-launched/|title=First Letterkenny heritage magazine launched|work=[[Donegal News]]|publisher=North-West News Group|location=Letterkenney, Ireland|date=14 March 2013|accessdate=14 March 2013|quote=Over 100 people attended the official launch of Letterkenny Community Heritage Group's new magazine in the Station House Hotel this week.

When he was five years old, Palin had his first acting experience at Birkdale playing Martha Cratchit in a school performance of ''[[A Christmas Carol]]''. At the age of 10, Palin, still interested in acting, made a comedy [[monologue]] and read a [[Shakespeare]] play to his mother while playing all the parts.&lt;ref name=Ross200&gt;Ross, 200&lt;/ref&gt; After his school days in 1962 he went on to read [[modern history]] at [[Brasenose College, Oxford]].&lt;ref name=whoswho/&gt; With fellow student [[Robert Hewison]] he performed and wrote, for the first time, comedy material at a university Christmas party.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acornmedia.com/rippingyarns/MEP_Bio.htm Michael Palin biography] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201073651/http://www.acornmedia.com/rippingyarns/MEP_Bio.htm |date=1 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Terry Jones]], also a student in Oxford, saw that performance and began writing together with Hewison and Palin.&lt;ref name=Ross200/&gt; In the same year Palin joined the Brightside and Carbrook Co-operative Society Players and first gained fame when he won an acting award at a Co-op drama festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/tv/documentaries/stories/s712623.htm |title=ABC TV Documentaries: Sahara episode 3/4 |accessdate=2 September 2006 |work=Australian Broadcasting Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also performed and wrote in [[the Oxford Revue]] (called the Et ceteras) with Jones.&lt;ref&gt;Desert Island Discs, Radio 4, Sat 17 November 1979 – http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/features/desert-island-discs/castaway/b74f8680#p009mwvb&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966 he married Helen Gibbins, whom he first met in 1959 on holiday in [[Southwold]] in Suffolk.&lt;ref name="ind120729"/&gt; This meeting was later fictionalised in Palin's play ''East of Ipswich''.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, 57&lt;/ref&gt; The couple have three children: Thomas (b. 1969), William (b. 1971) and Rachel (b. 1975) and two grandchildren.

==Early career==
After finishing university in 1965 Palin became a presenter on a comedy pop show called ''Now!'' for the television contractor [[Television Wales and the West]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/510300/index.html |title=Michael Palin|first=John |last=Oliver |work=BFI Screen Online|accessdate= 13 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time Palin was contacted by Jones, who had left university a year earlier, for assistance in writing a theatrical documentary about sex through the ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://idler.co.uk/conversations/in-conversation-with-michael-palin/ |first=Tom |last=Hodgkinson |work=The Idler |title=In Conversation with Michael Palin |year=2006 |accessdate=20 December 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080103064336/http://idler.co.uk/conversations/in-conversation-with-michael-palin/ |archivedate=3 January 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this project was eventually abandoned, it brought Palin and Jones together as a writing duo and led them to write comedy for various [[BBC]] programmes, such as ''The Ken Dodd Show'', ''The Billy Cotton Bandshow'', and ''The Illustrated Weekly Hudd''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://orangecow.org/pythonet/michael-palin.html |title=Biography |website=Pythonet.org |accessdate=17 December 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061115215629/http://orangecow.org/pythonet/michael-palin.html |archivedate=15 November 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They collaborated in writing lyrics for an album by Barry Booth called Diversions. They were also in the team of writers working for ''[[The Frost Report]]'', whose other members included [[Frank Muir]], [[Barry Cryer]], [[Marty Feldman]], [[Ronnie Barker]], [[Ronnie Corbett]], [[Dick Vosburgh]] and future Monty Python members [[Graham Chapman]], [[John Cleese]] and [[Eric Idle]]. Although the members of Monty Python had already encountered each other over the years, ''The Frost Report'' was the first time all the British members of Monty Python (its sixth member, [[Terry Gilliam]], was at that time an American citizen) worked together.&lt;ref name="ind120729"/&gt; During the run of ''The Frost Report'' the Palin/Jones team contributed material to two shows starring [[John Bird (actor)|John Bird]]: ''The Late Show'' and ''A Series of Birds''. For ''A Series of Birds'' the Palin/Jones team had their first experience of writing narrative instead of the short sketches they were accustomed to conceiving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/guide/articles/s/seriesofbirdsa_1299002783.shtml | title = A Series of Bird's | publisher = BBC Guide to Comedy | accessdate = 16 September 2006 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070203114420/http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/guide/articles/s/seriesofbirdsa_1299002783.shtml | archive-date = 3 February 2007 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following ''The Frost Report'' the Palin/Jones team worked both as actors and writers on the show ''[[Twice a Fortnight]]'' with [[Graeme Garden]], [[Bill Oddie]] and [[Jonathan Lynn]], and the successful children's comedy show ''[[Do Not Adjust Your Set]]'' with Idle and [[David Jason]]. The show also featured musical numbers by the [[Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band]], including future Monty Python musical collaborator [[Neil Innes]]. The animations for ''Do Not Adjust Your Set'' were made by Terry Gilliam. Eager to work with Palin&lt;ref&gt;Ross, 91&lt;/ref&gt; sans Jones, Cleese later asked him to perform in ''[[How to Irritate People]]'' together with Chapman and [[Tim Brooke-Taylor]]. The Palin/Jones team were reunited for ''[[The Complete and Utter History of Britain]]''.

===''Monty Python''===
{{Main|Monty Python}}
On the strength of their work on ''The Frost Report'' and other programmes, Cleese and Chapman had been offered a show by the BBC, but Cleese was reluctant to do a [[Double act|two-man show]] for various reasons, among them Chapman's reputedly difficult personality. During this period Cleese contacted Palin about doing the show that would ultimately become ''Monty Python's Flying Circus''.&lt;ref name="ind120729"/&gt; At the same time the success of ''Do Not Adjust Your Set'' had led Palin, Jones, Idle and Gilliam to be offered their own series and, while it was still in production, Palin agreed to Cleese's proposal and brought along Idle, Jones and Gilliam. Thus the formation of the Monty Python troupe has been referred to as a result of Cleese's desire to work with Palin and the chance circumstances that brought the other four members into the fold.&lt;ref name="Python Autobiography"/&gt;

In ''Monty Python'', Palin played various roles, which ranged from manic enthusiasm (such as the [[lumberjack]] of [[the Lumberjack Song]], or Herbert Anchovy, host of the game show "Blackmail") to unflappable calmness (such as the [[Dead Parrot sketch|Dead parrot]] vendor or [[Cheese Shop sketch|Cheese Shop]] proprietor). As a [[Double act|straight man]] he was often a foil to the rising ire of characters portrayed by [[John Cleese]]. He also played timid, socially inept characters such as Arthur Putey, the man who sits quietly as a marriage counsellor ([[Eric Idle]]) makes love to his wife ([[Carol Cleveland]]), and Mr. Anchovy, a chartered accountant who wants to become a lion tamer. He also appeared as the [["It's" man]] at the beginning of most episodes.

Palin frequently co-wrote sketches with [[Terry Jones]] and also initiated the "[[The Spanish Inquisition (Monty Python)|Spanish Inquisition sketch]]", which included the [[catchphrase]] "Nobody expects the [[Spanish Inquisition]]!"
He also composed songs with Jones including "The Lumberjack Song", "[[Every Sperm is Sacred]]" and "[[Spam (Monty Python)|Spam]]". His solo musical compositions included "[[Decomposing Composers]]" and "[[Finland (comedy song)|Finland]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Kathleen C.|last=Fennessy|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/r82483|title=Monty Python Sings – Monty Python: Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards|work=AllMusic|publisher=[[All Media Network]]|location=San Francisco, California}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other work==
[[File:Michaelpalinnightingale.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Michael Palin, Nightingale House, November 2010]]
After the ''Monty Python'' television series ended in 1974, the Palin/Jones team worked on ''[[Ripping Yarns]]'', an intermittent television comedy series broadcast over three years from 1976. They had earlier collaborated on the play ''[[Secrets (play)|Secrets]]'' from the BBC series ''[[Black and Blue (TV series)|Black and Blue]]'' in 1973. He starred as Dennis the Peasant in Terry Gilliam's 1977 film ''[[Jabberwocky (film)|Jabberwocky]]''. Palin also appeared in ''[[All You Need Is Cash]]'' (1978) as Eric Manchester (based on [[Derek Taylor]]), the press agent for [[the Rutles]]. In 1980, Palin co-wrote ''[[Time Bandits]]'' with Terry Gilliam. He also acted in the film.

In 1982, Palin wrote and starred in ''[[The Missionary]]'', co-starring [[Maggie Smith]]. In it, he plays the Reverend Charles Fortescue, who is recalled from Africa to aid prostitutes. He co-starred with Maggie Smith again in the 1984 comedy film ''[[A Private Function]]''. In 1984, he reunited with Terry Gilliam to appear in ''[[Brazil (1985 film)|Brazil]]''. He appeared in the comedy film ''[[A Fish Called Wanda]]'', for which he won the [[BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role]].&lt;ref name="BAFTA" /&gt; Cleese reunited the main cast almost a decade later to make ''[[Fierce Creatures]]''. After filming for ''Fierce Creatures'' finished, Palin went on a travel journey for a BBC documentary and, returning a year later, found that the end of ''Fierce Creatures'' had failed at test screenings and had to be reshot.

Until "The Death of Stalin" in 2017, and with the exception of several made-for-TV films and voice work for animations, Palin's last film role was a small part in ''[[The Wind in the Willows (1996 film)|The Wind in the Willows]]'', a film directed by and starring Terry Jones. Palin also appeared with John Cleese in his documentary, ''[[The Human Face]]''. Palin was cast in a supporting role in the [[Tom Hanks]] and [[Meg Ryan]] romantic comedy ''[[You've Got Mail]]'', but his role was eventually cut entirely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Hans|last=ten Cate|url=http://www.dailyllama.com/news/1999/llama088.html |title=NEWS 1999_01_17 – Michael Palin Dropped From Final Print of Hanks/Ryan Romantic Comedy |publisher=Daily Llama |date=17 January 1999 |accessdate=1 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also assisted [[Campaign for Better Transport (UK)|Campaign for Better Transport]] and others with campaigns on sustainable transport, particularly those relating to urban areas, and has been president of the campaign since 1986.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bettertransport.org.uk/take_action/see_michael_palin ''Campaign for Better Transport website''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017022350/http://www.bettertransport.org.uk/take_action/see_michael_palin |date=17 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Palin has also appeared in serious drama. In 1991 Palin worked as producer and actor in the film ''[[American Friends]]'' based upon a real event in the life of his great-grandfather, a fellow at [[St John's College, Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/american_friends/ |title=American Friends|website= [[Rotten Tomatoes]].com|accessdate= 13 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.churchtimes.co.uk/articles/2015/22-may/features/features/michael-palin-my-seven-of-the-best|title=Michael Palin: my seven of the best|website=www.churchtimes.co.uk|access-date=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that same year he also played the part of a headmaster in [[Alan Bleasdale]]'s [[Channel 4]] drama series ''[[G.B.H. (TV drama)|GBH]]''.

Palin also had a small cameo role in Australian soap opera ''[[Home and Away]]''. He played an English [[surfer]] with a fear of [[shark]]s, who interrupts a conversation between two main characters to ask whether there were any sharks in the sea. This was filmed while he was in Australia for the ''Full Circle'' series, with a segment about the filming of the role featuring in the series. In November 2005, he appeared in the ''[[John Peel's Record Box]]'' documentary.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0814163/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1 "John Peel's Record Box"], 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 Michael Palin appeared in a [[First World War]] drama titled ''[[The Wipers Times]]'' written by [[Ian Hislop]] and [[Nick Newman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-23128507|accessdate=2 July 2013|title=Python Palin stars in BBC WWI drama |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the Cannes Film Festival in 2016, it was announced that Palin was set to star alongside [[Adam Driver]] in [[Terry Gilliam]]'s ''[[The Man Who Killed Don Quixote]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Craig|last=Skinner|url=http://www.flickreel.com/terry-gilliams-the-man-who-killed-don-quixote-to-star-adam-driver-and-michael-palin-new-concept-art-uncovered/|title=EXCLUSIVE: TERRY GILLIAM’S THE MAN WHO KILLED DON QUIXOTE TO STAR ADAM DRIVER AND MICHAEL PALIN; NEW CONCEPT ART UNCOVERED|work=Flickreel.com|date=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Palin, however, dropped out of the film after it ran into a financial problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Dave|last=Itzkoff|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/28/arts/television/michael-palin-monty-python-remember-me-pbs.html|title=Nobody Expects Michael Palin: A Comic Actor in a Dramatic Role |work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=New York Times Company|location=New York City|date=June 28, 2017|accessdate=July 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Activism===
In July 2010, Palin sent a message of support for the [[Dongria Kondh]] tribe of [[India]], who are resisting mining on their land by the company [[Vedanta Resources]]. Palin said, "I've been to the Nyamgiri Hills in [[Odisha|Orissa]] and seen the forces of money and power that Vedanta Resources have arrayed against a people who have occupied their land for thousands of years, who husband the forest sustainably and make no great demands on the state or the government. The tribe I visited simply want to carry on living in the villages that they and their ancestors have always lived in".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.survivalinternational.org/news/6269 Michael Palin sends message to support Dongria Kondh], Survival International&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 January 2011, Palin became the first person to sign the UK-based Campaign for Better Transport's Fair Fares Now campaign. In July 2015, Palin signed an open letter and gave an interview to support "a strong BBC at the centre of British life" at a time the government was reviewing the corporation's size and activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-33547098 | title= Michael Palin: 'BBC still lets us experiment' | work=BBC News | date=16 July 2015 | accessdate=17 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Television documentaries==
===Travel===
Palin's first travel documentary was segment 4 of the 1980 [[BBC Television]] series ''[[Great Railway Journeys of the World]]'', entitled ''Confessions of a Trainspotter''.  Throughout the hour long show, Palin humorously reminisces about his childhood hobby of [[train spotting]], while he travels throughout the UK by train, from London to the [[Kyle of Lochalsh]], via [[Manchester]], [[York]], [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], Edinburgh and [[Inverness]]. He rides vintage train lines and trains including ''[[LNER Class A3 4472 Flying Scotsman|Flying Scotsman]]''.  At the Kyle of Lochalsh, Palin bought the station's long metal platform sign and is seen lugging it back to London with him.

In 1994, Palin travelled through Ireland for the same series, entitled "Derry to Kerry". In a quest for family roots, he attempted to trace his great grandmother&amp;nbsp;– Brita Gallagher&amp;nbsp;– who set sail from Ireland {{round|{{age|format=raw|1847|1|1}}|-1}} years ago during the [[Great Irish Famine|Great Famine (1845–1849)]], bound for a new life in [[Burlington, New Jersey|Burlington]], New Jersey. The series is a trip along the Palin family line.

Starting in 1989, Palin appeared as presenter in a series of travel programmes made for the BBC. It was after the veteran TV globetrotter [[Alan Whicker]] and journalist [[Miles Kington]] turned down presenting the first of these, ''Around the World in 80 Days'', that gave Palin the opportunity to present his first and subsequent travel shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3724/is_200508/ai_n14903488/pg_1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601220419/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3724/is_200508/ai_n14903488/pg_1 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=1 June 2013 |title=Watching over Whicker |publisher=Findarticles.com |date=6 August 2005 |accessdate=25 October 2008 | first=Michael | last=Vestey}}&lt;/ref&gt; These programmes have been broadcast around the world in syndication, and were also sold on VHS tape and later on DVD:

* ''[[Michael Palin: Around the World in 80 Days]]'' (Travel 1988; Programme release 1989): travelling as closely as possible the path described in the famous [[Jules Verne]] story without using aircraft.
* ''[[Pole to Pole]]'' (Travel 1991; Programme release 1992): travelling from the [[North Pole]] to the [[South Pole]], following as closely as possible the 30-degree line of [[longitude]], over as much land as possible, i.e., through Europe and Africa.
* ''[[Full Circle with Michael Palin]]'' (Travel 1995/96; Programme release 1997): in which he circumnavigated the lands around the Pacific Ocean anti-clockwise; a journey of almost {{convert|50000|mi|km}} starting on [[Little Diomede]] Island in the [[Bering Strait]] and taking him through Asia, Oceania and the Americas.
* ''[[Michael Palin's Hemingway Adventure]]'' (1999): retracing the footsteps of [[Ernest Hemingway]] through the United States, Europe, Africa and the [[Caribbean]].
* ''[[Sahara with Michael Palin]]'' (Travel 2001/02; Programme release 2002): in which he trekked around and through the world's [[Sahara|largest desert]].
* ''[[Himalaya with Michael Palin]]'' (Travel 2003/04; Programme release 2004): in which he travels through the [[Himalaya|Himalaya region]].
* ''[[Michael Palin's New Europe]]'' (Travel 2006/07; Programme release 2007): in which he travels through [[Central Europe|Central]] and Eastern Europe.
* ''[[Brazil with Michael Palin]]'' (2012) in which he travels through [[Brazil]].

Following each trip, Palin wrote a book about his travels, providing information and insights not included in the TV programme. Each book is illustrated with photographs by [[Basil Pao]], the stills photographer who was on the team. (Exception: the first book, ''Around the World in 80 Days'', contains some pictures by Pao but most are by other photographers.)

All seven of these books were also made available as audio books, and all of them are read by Palin himself. ''Around the World in 80 Days'' and ''Hemingway Adventure'' are unabridged, while the other four books were made in both abridged and unabridged versions, although the unabridged versions can be very difficult to find.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

For four of the trips a photography book was made by Pao, each with an introduction written by Palin. These are large coffee-table style books with pictures printed on glossy paper. The majority of the pictures are of various people encountered on the trip, as informal portraits or showing them engaged in some interesting activity. Some of the landscape photos are displayed as two-page spreads.

Palin's travel programmes are responsible for a phenomenon termed the "Palin effect": areas of the world that he has visited suddenly become popular tourist attractions&amp;nbsp;– for example, the significant increase in the number of tourists interested in [[Peru]] after Palin visited [[Machu Picchu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Ben | last=Webster | title=Globetrotter Palin brought down to earth by eco-lobby|date=14 January 2005 | url =http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article788287.ece | work=The Times | accessdate =14 August 2006 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2006 survey of "15 of the world's top travel writers" by ''[[The Observer]]'', Palin named Peru's [[Pongo de Mainique]] (canyon below the Machu Picchu) his "favourite place in the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Wilkinson, Carl | date=8 January 2006 | title=My favourite place in the world |work=The Observer |location=UK | url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2006/jan/08/observerescapesection5
 | accessdate=18 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Palin notes in his book of ''Around the World in 80 Days'' that the final leg of his journey could originally have taken him and his crew on one of the trains involved in the [[Clapham Junction rail crash]], but they arrived ahead of schedule and caught an earlier train.

===Art and history===
[[File:An evening with Michael Palin.jpg|thumb|right|Palin in 2015]]
In recent years, Palin has written and presented occasional documentary programmes on artists that interest him. The first, on [[Scottish people|Scottish]] painter [[Anne Redpath]], was ''Palin on Redpath'' in 1997. In ''The Bright Side of Life'' (2000), Palin continued on a Scottish theme, looking at the work of the [[Scottish Colourists]]. Two further programmes followed on European painters; ''Michael Palin and the Ladies Who Loved Matisse'' (2004) and ''Michael Palin and the Mystery of Hammershøi'' (2005), about the French artist [[Henri Matisse]] and [[Danes|Danish]] artist [[Vilhelm Hammershøi]] respectively. The DVD ''Michael Palin on Art'' contains all these documentaries except for the [[Henri Matisse|Matisse]] programme.

In November 2008, Palin presented a [[First World War]] documentary about [[Armistice Day]], 11 November 1918, when thousands of soldiers lost their lives in battle after the war had officially ended. Palin filmed on the battlefields of [[Northern France]] and [[Belgium]] for the programme, called the ''[[Last Day of World War One]]'', produced for the BBC's ''Timewatch'' series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/timewatch/last-day-of-ww1.shtml |title=Timewatch&amp;nbsp;– The Last Day of World War One |publisher=BBC  |accessdate=1 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and honours==
[[File:153335 'Michael Palin' at Cambridge.JPG|thumb|Class 153, no. 153335 'Michael Palin' at [[Cambridge]].]]
Palin was instrumental in setting up the [[Michael Palin Centre for Stammering Children]] in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23552778-details/Palin%27s+centre+for+stammerers+wins+%C2%A3340%2C000+grant/article.do | title=Palin's centre for stammerers wins £340,000 grant | accessdate=9 September 2008 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913183801/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23552778-details/Palin's+centre+for+stammerers+wins+%C2%A3340,000+grant/article.do | archivedate=13 September 2008 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1993, each member of Monty Python had an [[asteroid]] named after him.

The story goes that John Cleese paid for the stone, and mischievously insisted on misspelling his name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://londonist.com/2015/10/hiding-in-plain-site#gallery=2133548,2133558 | work=Londonist | title=11 Secret Features of Famous London Landmarks | date=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In honour of his achievements as a traveller, especially rail travel, Palin has two British trains named after him. In 2002, Virgin Trains' new £5&amp;nbsp;million high speed [[British Rail Class 221|Super Voyager]] train number 221130 was named "Michael Palin"&amp;nbsp;– it carries his name externally and a plaque is located adjacent to the onboard shop with information on Palin and his many journeys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.virgintrainsmediaroom.com/index.cfm?articleid=179 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061016090511/http://www.virgintrainsmediaroom.com/index.cfm?articleid=179 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=16 October 2006 |title=Virgin Trains |accessdate=13 December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, [[National Express East Anglia]] named a [[British Rail Class 153]] (unit number 153335) after him. (He is also a [[model railway]] enthusiast.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.009.cd2.com/young.htm 009.cd2.com]&lt;/ref&gt;)

In 2008, he received the [[James Joyce Award]] of the [[Literary and Historical Society (University College Dublin)|Literary and Historical Society]] in Dublin. In recognition of his services to the promotion of geography, Palin was awarded the [[David Livingstone Centenary Medal|Livingstone Medal]] of the [[Royal Scottish Geographical Society]] in March 2009, along with a Fellowship to the Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsgs.org/awardsandmedals/ |title=Royal Scottish Geographical Society: Medals &amp; Awards |accessdate=29 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100212031439/http://www.rsgs.org/awardsandmedals/ |archivedate=12 February 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2013, he was similarly honoured in Canada with a gold medal for achievements in geography by the [[Royal Canadian Geographical Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ouzounian|first=Richard|title=Michael Palin, from Monty Python to travel series host|url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/2013/06/21/the_big_interview_with_monty_pythons_michael_palin.html|accessdate=26 June 2013|newspaper=The Toronto Star|date=26 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2009, Palin was elected for a three-year term as President of the [[Royal Geographical Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rgs.org/NR/rdonlyres/A9C558E3-889B-4EAC-81B6-BFAEF347B38D/0/090601_MichaelPalin.pdf |title=Michael Palin announced as new president of Royal Geographical Society (with IBG) | accessdate=25 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of his self-described "amenable, conciliatory character" Michael Palin has been referred to as unofficially "Britain's Nicest Man."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/starsandstories/6055546/Michael-Palin-hes-not-a-Messiah-just-a-very-nice-man.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Marc | last=Lee | title=Michael Palin: he's not a Messiah, just a very nice man | date=24 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
