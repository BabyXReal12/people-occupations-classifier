===Comedy===

He slept in his 1976 [[Ford]] when not performing gigs that provided a hotel, and he showered at gas stations or swimming pool showers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Steve Harvey: I Was Homeless for Three Years|author=Triggs, Charlotte|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20741192,00.html|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]|date=October 3, 2013|accessdate=September 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rich and Becky Liss helped Harvey during this time with a contract for carpet cleaning and credit at a travel agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2013-01-23/entertainment/os-steve-harvey-sheds-tears-over-orlando-supporters-20130123_1_steve-harvey-travel-agency-tears|title=Steve Harvey sheds tears over generous Orlando supporters|work=Orlando Sentinel|date=January 23, 2013|accessdate=September 27, 2014|author=Boedeker, Hal|archivedate=September 27, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140927180452/http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2013-01-23/entertainment/os-steve-harvey-sheds-tears-over-orlando-supporters-20130123_1_steve-harvey-travel-agency-tears}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a finalist in the Second Annual [[Johnnie Walker]] National Comedy Search performing on April 16, 1990, eventually leading to a long stint as host of ''[[It's Showtime at the Apollo]]'', succeeding [[Mark Curry (actor)|Mark Curry]] in that role. His success as a [[stand-up comedy|stand-up comedian]] led to a starring role on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] show ''[[Me and the Boys (TV series)|Me and the Boys]]'' in 1994. He would later star on the [[The Warner Brothers|WB]] network show, ''[[The Steve Harvey Show]]'', which ran from 1996 to 2002. While popular, the show never achieved critical acclaim outside of the African-American community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Steve Harvey- Biography|url=https://movies.yahoo.com/person/steve-harvey/biography.html|publisher=[[Yahoo!

In 1997, Harvey continued his work in stand-up comedy, performing on the Kings of Comedy tour along with [[Cedric the Entertainer]], [[D.L. Hughley]], and [[Bernie Mac]]. The comedy act would later be put together into a film by [[Spike Lee]] called ''[[The Original Kings of Comedy]]''. DVD sales of ''The Original Kings of Comedy'' and ''Don't Trip, He Ain't Through With Me Yet'' increased Harvey's popularity. He released a [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[R&amp;B]] CD on a [[record label]] he founded, and authored the book ''Steve Harvey's Big Time''. That title was also used as the name of his comedy and variety television show (later renamed ''[[Steve Harvey's Big Time Challenge]]''), which aired on [[The WB]] network from 2003 until 2005. Harvey launched a clothing line which featured a line of dress wear. In 2005 he co-starred in the movie ''[[Racing Stripes]]''.

He achieved further critical and commercial success through his book ''[[Act Like a Lady, Think Like a Man]]'' and its subsequent cinematic follow-up ''[[Think Like a Man]]'', an ensemble romantic comedy depicting characters taking advice on dating from the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Saltz|first=Rachel|title=‘Think Like a Man’ Brings Steve Harvey’s Book to Life|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2012/04/20/movies/think-like-a-man-brings-steve-harveys-book-to-life.html|accessdate=June 24, 2013|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|date=April 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few minutes after she was crowned, Harvey announced that he had read the results incorrectly and that [[Binibining Pilipinas|Miss Philippines]], [[Pia Wurtzbach]], was the new Miss Universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2015/12/20/media/miss-universe-steve-harvey-mistake/index.html|title=Steve Harvey mistakenly crowns the wrong Miss Universe 2015|last=Stelter|first=Brian|date=December 21, 2015|publisher=[[CNNMoney]]|accessdate=December 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He apologized to Wurtzbach outside the venue and later [[Twitter|tweeted]] an apology to both contestants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hegina|first1=Aries Joseph|title=Steve Harvey apologizes for Miss Universe mix-up; misspells PH, Colombia|url=http://lifestyle.inquirer.net/217010/steve-harvey-apologizes-for-miss-universe-mix-up-misspells-ph-colombia|accessdate=December 21, 2015|work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]|date=December 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=WATCH: Host says sorry to Pia Wurtzbach over mix-up|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/lifestyle/12/21/15/watch-host-says-sorry-to-pia-wurtzbach-over-mix-up|accessdate=December 21, 2015|work=[[ABS-CBNnews.com]]|publisher=[[ABS-CBN Corporation]]|date=December 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Host Steve Harvey Botches Miss Universe Announcement|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/host-steve-harvey-botches-miss-universe-announcement-n483586|date=Dec 21, 2015|publisher=NBC News|accessdate=December 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harvey also hosted the [[Miss Universe 2016]] pageant in the Philippines on January 30, 2017, telling the [[Miss Universe Organization]] that he wanted to personally apologize to the Filipinos for the incident that occurred in the last Miss Universe pageant he hosted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Steve Harvey will host Miss Universe in PH|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/life/07/29/16/steve-harvey-will-host-miss-universe-in-ph|accessdate=July 30, 2016|work=[[ABS-CBN News]]|date=July 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He returned as host for the [[Miss Universe 2017]] pageant in Las Vegas on November 26, 2017.

Harvey is set to host the Miss Universe 2018 pageant in Thailand on December 16, 2018. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://deadline.com/2018/07/miss-universe-pageant-2018-date-location-steve-harvey-returning-as-host-1202436544/|title=Miss Universe 2018 Heads To Thailand With Steve Harvey Returning As Host|last=Petski|first=Denise|date=2018-07-31|work=Deadline|access-date=2018-07-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Variety specials ===
In October 2016, it was announced that Harvey would host two revival specials of ''[[Showtime at the Apollo]]'' for Fox.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/steve-harvey-to-host-showtime-at-the-apollo-revival-on-fox-1201886943|title=Steve Harvey to Host ‘Showtime at the Apollo’ Revival on Fox|last=Holloway|first=Daniel|date=2016-10-12|work=Variety|access-date=2017-11-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fox later announced that Harvey would host the network's [[New Year's Eve]] special from [[Times Square Ball|Times Square]] for 2018. As with his talk show, it will be produced by IMG.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/fox-swaps-pitbull-steve-harvey-new-years-eve-1059096|title=Fox Swaps Pitbull for Steve Harvey on New Year's Eve|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=2017-11-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
===Political commentary===
In August 2011, on his radio show, Harvey called [[Cornel West]] and [[Tavis Smiley]], "[[Uncle Tom]]s", because of their criticism of President [[Barack Obama]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://thegrio.com/2011/08/10/steve-harvey-cornel-west-tavis-smiley-are-uncle-toms/#13768994090191&amp;386px Steve Harvey: Cornel West, Tavis Smiley are 'Uncle Toms'] Deron Dalton. the Grio.com.

He defended his decision, citing that it would help spark positive changes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.essence.com/celebrity/steve-harvey-wont-attend-2017-inauguration|title=Steve Harvey: 'I Won't Be At Anybody's Inauguration Because My Wife Said No'|date=January 15, 2017|first=Rachaell|last=Davis|work=Essence|edition=online|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|accessdate=May 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but then later admitted on [[Steve (talk show)|his talk show]] that he hopes to never run into Trump again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pYDiaCiLbk|title=Our biggest secrets are coming out!

===Comments about atheists===
Harvey has received criticism for a May 30, 2009 book interview he gave on ''[[Larry King Live]]'' guest hosted by [[Joy Behar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/video/#/video/showbiz/2009/05/29/lkl.steve.harvey.cnn?iref=allsearch|title=Steve Harvey on relationships|first=Joy|last=Behar|publisher=CNN|date=30 May 2009|accessdate=15 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During that interview, he asserted that women should not date atheists who, he claimed, have no "moral barometer." He opined that atheists are "idiot[s]" and stated that his usual response to discussions with atheists is to walk away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnsnews.com/blog/michael-w-chapman/steve-harvey-atheists-me-you-re-idiot|title=Steve Harvey on Atheists: 'To Me, You're An Idiot'|first=Michael|last=Chapman|publisher=CNS News|date=2015-01-06|accessdate=2017-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/attacks-atheists-continue-article-1.3109420|title=The attacks on atheists continue: Gov.

===Comments about Asian men===
In January 2017, Steve Harvey made jokes on ''Steve Harvey'' about Asian men, ridiculing the idea that any white woman or black woman would want to date them. "Excuse me, do you like Asian men?", he said, "No, thank you." He went on to add, "I don’t even like Chinese food."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/steve-harvey-fire-making-jokes-asian-men-article-1.2944619|title=Steve Harvey under fire for making jokes about Asian men|newspaper=NY Daily News|access-date=2017-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remarks were met with criticism from members of the [[Asian American]] community, including [[New York (state)|New York]] politicians and author [[Eddie Huang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/steve-harvey-hot-water-asian-american-n-y-lawmakers-article-1.2946405|title=Steve Harvey in hot water with Asian-American New York lawmakers|first=Rich|last=Schapiro|publisher=NY Daily News|date=2017-01-14|accessdate=2017-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vulture.com/2017/01/eddie-huang-on-steve-harveys-jokes-on-asian-men.html|title=Eddie Huang on Steve Harvey’s ‘Hypocritical’ and ‘Upsetting’ Willingness to Emasculate Asian Men for Laughs|date=2017-01-15|newspaper=Vulture|access-date=2017-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harvey apologized on his talk show and Twitter, saying: "I offer my humblest apology for offending anyone, particularly those in the Asian community. ... "It was not my intention and the humor was not meant with any malice or disrespect whatsoever."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etonline.com/tv/207704_steve_harvey_apologizes_for_asian_men_remarks/|title=Steve Harvey Apologizes for Racist Asian Jokes: 'Not Meant With Any Malice or Disrespect'|first=Alex|last=Ungerman|publisher=ET|date=2017-01-17|accessdate=2017-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comments about Flint water crisis===
In response to a caller from [[Flint, Michigan]] who insulted the Cleveland Cavaliers after their loss to the Golden State Warriors, Harvey, a Cavaliers fan, told the caller to "go have yourself a nice glass of brown water!" in reference to the [[Flint water crisis|city's water crisis]]. The joke was criticized by, among others, [[List of presidential trips made by Barack Obama during 2016#May|Amariyanna Copeny]] and Flint Mayor [[Karen Weaver]], who demanded a public apology. Harvey responded by saying, "The caller and I were talking trash about our teams and cities. Simply trash talking about sports. I made a joke directed at him, as he is from Flint, a city for which I have great affection and respect. So much so that I devoted a full hour on my daytime talk show to raising awareness for the Flint water crisis. ... The caller laughed, as my joke was taken in the context it was offered."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.metrotimes.com/the-scene/archives/2017/06/14/did-steve-harvey-really-tell-a-flint-resident-to-enjoy-your-nice-brown-glass-of-water|title=Did Steve Harvey really tell a Flint resident to 'enjoy your nice brown glass of water?'|last=Roskopp|first=Jack|date=June 14, 2017|accessdate=June 17, 2017|newspaper=[[Metro Times]]|location=[[Ferndale, Michigan]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fox2detroit.com/news/local-news/261782302-story|publisher=WJBK|title='Little Miss Flint,' Mayor Karen Weaver blast Steve Harvey after water joke|date=June 15, 2017|accessdate=August 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Harvey has been married three times and has seven children (4 biological and 3 stepchildren). From his first marriage, to Marcia Harvey, he has two daughters (twins Brandi and Karli) and one son (Broderick Harvey Jr).&lt;ref&gt;Emily Strohm and Brittany King, [http://people.com/tv/steve-harvey-on-leaving-first-wife-and-family-to-chase-his-dream/ People Magazine: "Steve Harvey on Finding Forgiveness from His Daughters After Leaving Them to Chase His Dream of Becoming a Comedian"], people.com, May 25, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="yahoobio"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blackcelebkids.com/2008/05/17/steve-harvey-loves-his-blended-family|title=Harvey in June 2008 Essence Mag Father's Day article|archivedate=October 14, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014001900/http://www.blackcelebkids.com/2008/05/17/steve-harvey-loves-his-blended-family/}}&lt;/ref&gt; From his second marriage, to Mary Shackelford, Harvey has another son named Wynton.&lt;ref&gt;[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/gossip/2011/01/steve-harvey-ex-wife-mary-harvey.html Los Angeles Times: "Steve Harvey's ex-wife speaks out on marriage, infidelity"] January 24, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.steveharveytv.com/celebrate-my-drive] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131009032229/http://www.steveharveytv.com/celebrate-my-drive|date=October 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple divorced in November 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perfectpeople.net/biography/8562/steve-harvey.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228184907/http://www.perfectpeople.net/biography/8562/steve-harvey.htm|date=February 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, [[Collin County, Texas]]-based 199th District Court Judge Robert Dry expressed concern about Mary Harvey spreading false information about the divorce, with the judge suggesting that she had not been left materially destitute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/steve-harvey-ex-wife-mary-harvey-slammed-judge-making-false-allegations-comedian-article-1.135268|title=Steve Harvey's ex slammed by judge for making false allegations|publisher=Nydailynews.com|date=February 8, 2011|accessdate=June 10, 2015|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Steve Harvey's Ex-Wife Blasts Him For Cheating|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/01/24/steve-harveys-exwife-blas_n_813096.html|date=April 2011|accessdate=October 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
