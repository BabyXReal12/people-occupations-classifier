He directed ''[[Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy]]'' (2004), ''[[Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby]]'' (2006), ''[[Step Brothers (film)|Step Brothers]]'' (2008), ''[[The Other Guys]]'' (2010), and ''[[Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues]]'' (2013). McKay has a creative partnership with actor [[Will Ferrell]], with whom he has co-written and produced TV series and films.

''[[The Big Short (film)|The Big Short]]'' (2015) was the first film McKay directed without Ferrell in the cast.

McKay and Ferrell produced their comedy website [[Funny or Die]] and [[HBO]]'s ''[[Eastbound &amp; Down]]'' through their company [[Gary Sanchez Productions]].

==Personal life==
McKay was born in 1968 in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], to a cocktail waitress mother and a bassist father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/01/movies/01mckay.html|title=Men in Blue, Under Arrested Adolescence|date=1 August 2010|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2016-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from [[Great Valley High School]] in [[Malvern, Pennsylvania|Malvern]], [[Pennsylvania]], and attended [[Penn State]] and [[Temple University]]. McKay dropped out from the university a semester-and-a-half before he was set to earn his bachelor's degree. He described it as "settling with an imaginary degree".&lt;ref name=Temple&gt;{{cite news|last=Maehrer|first=Avery|title=''Anchorman'' director Adam McKay reflects on Philly past|url=http://temple-news.com/arts/anchorman-director-adam-mckay-reflects-philly-past/|accessdate=2014-03-18|newspaper=The Temple News|date=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is one of the founding members of the [[Upright Citizens Brigade]] [[improvisational comedy|improv]] comedy group and a former performer at Chicago's [[Improv Olympic]], where he was a member of the improv group, The Family, whose members included [[Matt Besser]], [[Ian Roberts (American actor)|Ian Roberts]], [[Neil Flynn]], [[Miles Stroth]], and [[Ali Farahnakian]], and [[Child's Play Touring Theatre]]. While a member of the mainstage cast at [[The Second City|Second City]], he wrote and performed in that company's landmark revue, ''Pinata Full of Bees''. In several politically charged sketches, McKay played characters like [[Noam Chomsky]] as a substitute kindergarten teacher, and a hapless personnel manager trying to inform a corporate vice president ([[Scott Adsit]]) of some disastrous IQ test results without losing his own job. The latter performance was excerpted in Second City's 40th anniversary compilation.

Mckay serves on the Creative Council of [[Represent.Us]], a [[Nonpartisanism|nonpartisan]] anti-corruption organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://represent.us/about/|title=About {{!}} Represent. Us|language=en-US|accessdate=2016-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McKay has an [[essential tremor]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Goodyear|first=Dana|title=Hollywood Shadows|url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/03/21/110321fa_fact_goodyear?currentPage=all|work=The New Yorker|accessdate=2014-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; a benign neurological disorder that sometimes causes shaking.

He is a supporter of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. He endorsed [[Bernie Sanders]] for [[President of the United States]] in 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/biz/news/will-ferrell-bernie-sanders-celebrity-supporters-1201597124/ |title=Will Ferrell Among Bernie Sanders Celeb Supporters |accessdate=2016-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://berniesanders.com/artists/ |title=Artists for Bernie - Bernie Sanders |accessdate=2016-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and identifies as a [[Democratic Socialism|Democratic Socialist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/ghostpanther/status/926497501435150336|accessdate=2017-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Writing, acting, and producing===
McKay originally auditioned for ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' to be an onscreen performer, but did not make the cut. However, the scripts he submitted to the long-running sketch show earned him a job as writer from 1995 to 2001, including two seasons as head writer. He also directed a number of short films for the show, including the original ''SNL'' Digital Shorts. McKay encouraged his Second City friend [[Tina Fey]] to submit some of her scripts to ''Saturday Night Live'', and she later succeeded him as head writer on the show. Though McKay was never an actual ''SNL'' cast member, he did make several on-camera appearances over the years and had a recurring role as an obnoxious audience member named "Keith" who would often shout insults at the celebrity hosts during their opening monologue.

Shortly after leaving ''SNL'', McKay teamed up with comedian [[Will Ferrell]] to write the comedy films ''[[Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy]]'' (2004), ''[[Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby]]'' (2006), ''[[Step Brothers (film)|Step Brothers]]'' (2008), and ''[[The Other Guys]]'' (2010), all of which he also directed, produced and made cameo appearances in as an actor. In 2007, Ferrell and McKay launched the user-submitted comedy video site ''[[Funny or Die]]''. A video on the site, titled ''[[The Landlord (2007 film)|The Landlord]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/74|title=Will Ferrell and Pearl in The Landlord}}&lt;/ref&gt; features both him and his young daughter, Pearl, whom Ferrell and his wife bait to say curse words. Pearl also starred in a second video titled ''[[Good Cop, Baby Cop]]''. Ferrell and McKay co-produce the HBO series ''[[Eastbound &amp; Down]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hotz |first=Amy |url=http://www.starnewsonline.com/article/20081021/ARTICLES/810210253 |title=StarNewsOnline.com |publisher=StarNewsOnline.com |date=2008-10-21 |accessdate=2013-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McKay was one of the writers for the film ''[[The Campaign (film)|The Campaign]]'' (2012), and produced the film ''[[Daddy's Home (film)|Daddy's Home]]'' (2015), the latter of which re-united ''The Other Guys'' stars Will Ferrell and [[Mark Wahlberg]], and was directed by [[Sean Anders]]. He wrote the screenplay for and directed ''[[The Big Short (film)|The Big Short]]'' (2015), the film adaptation of [[Michael Lewis]]'s book about the 2006â€“2010 financial crisis, and the build-up of the financial and credit bubble; the film starred [[Brad Pitt]], [[Christian Bale]], [[Ryan Gosling]], [[Steve Carell]], [[Melissa Leo]], [[Marisa Tomei]], and [[Byron Mann]]. He rewrote the script for the [[Marvel Studios]] feature film ''[[Ant-Man (film)|Ant-Man]]'' (2015), which [[Peyton Reed]] directed.

He produced the films ''[[Land of the Lost (film)|Land of the Lost]]'' (2009), ''[[The Goods: Live Hard, Sell Hard]]'' (2009), ''[[The Virginity Hit]]'' (2010), ''[[Casa de Mi Padre]]'' (2012), ''[[Bachelorette]]'' (2012), ''[[Tim and Eric's Billion Dollar Movie]]'' (2012), ''[[The Campaign (film)|The Campaign]]'' (2012), ''[[Hansel &amp; Gretel: Witch Hunters]]'' (2013), ''[[Tammy (film)|Tammy]]'' (2014), ''[[Welcome to Me]]'' (2014), ''[[Get Hard]]'' (2015), ''[[Sleeping with Other People]]'' (2015), ''[[Daddy's Home (film)|Daddy's Home]]'' (2015), and ''[[The Boss (2016 film)|The Boss]]'' (2016).

In addition to ''Eastbound &amp; Down'', he has produced the TV series ''[[Big Lake (TV series)|Big Lake]]'', the miniseries ''[[The Spoils of Babylon]]'', and ''[[The Chris Gethard Show]]''.

He has directed an "alternate film" about [[Ron Burgundy]] that is considered a companion to ''Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy'' (2004) entitled ''[[Wake Up, Ron Burgundy: The Lost Movie]]'' (2004), which is made up mostly of alternative takes, deleted scenes, and scrapped sub-plots from the original film strung together with a narrative.

McKay directed and co-wrote with Ferrell the [[George W. Bush]] Broadway show ''[[You're Welcome America]]''. He produced the [[horror fiction|horror]]-action film ''[[Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/20058 "'Twilight' Stars Offered Roles in 'Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters'], Bloody-Disgusting.com&lt;/ref&gt;

He directed and wrote the film adaptation of the [[Michael Lewis]] non-fiction book ''[[The Big Short]]'', released in 2015. He received a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Director]] and the [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay]] for his work in the film, winning his first Academy Award following his victory in the latter category. In 2016, he and co-writer Charles Randolph received the [[USC Scripter Award]].
