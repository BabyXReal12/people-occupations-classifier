==Career==

===Early career===
Tambor first moved to [[repertory theater]] in [[Milwaukee]], later making his Broadway debut in the comedy ''[[Sly Fox]]'' (1976), appearing with [[George C. Scott]] and directed by [[Arthur Penn]]. He appeared in ''[[Measure for Measure]]'' in the same year. In 1979 he starred in [[Norman Jewison]]'s ''[[...And Justice for All (film)|...And Justice For All]]'', as a lawyer friend of the protagonist, Arthur Kirkland ([[Al Pacino]]). In an early TV job, an ad for [[Avis Rent a Car System|Avis]] rent-a-car, he was seen running (huffing and puffing) through an airport, mocking [[O. J. Simpson]]'s "Go, O. J., go!" ads for [[The Hertz Corporation|Hertz]]. He has had a significant career in episodic TV, where he made numerous guest appearances on different shows, including ''[[Taxi (TV series)|Taxi]]'', ''[[Kojak]]'', ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', ''[[The Golden Girls]]'', and ''[[Three's Company]]''. In 1979 Tambor got his first role as a main character in television in the short-lived show ''[[The Ropers]]''. Throughout the 1980s Tambor had a recurring role on ''[[Hill Street Blues]]'' playing a defense attorney who eventually becomes a judge. In 1981 he appeared in an episode of [[Barney Miller]] as a man who was trying to bring exposure to the members of the [[Trilateral Commission]] in charge of the coming [[New World Order (conspiracy theory)|New World Order]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv6w_ys5sJo|title=Jeffrey Tambor explains the N.W.O. and the Trilateral Commission on Barney Miller in 1981|date=March 12, 2015|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987 and 1988, Tambor appeared as a regular on the prime time [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] series ''[[Max Headroom (TV series)|Max Headroom]]'' as Murray, Edison's editor. In 1990, he appeared in the music video for the [[Phil Collins]] song '[[I Wish It Would Rain Down]]'.

===''The Larry Sanders Show''===
Tambor played [[List of characters on The Larry Sanders Show#Hank Kingsley|Hank Kingsley]], the [[narcissistic]] sidekick of fictional talk show host [[Larry Sanders (character)|Larry Sanders]] on ''[[The Larry Sanders Show]]''. Tambor received four Emmy nominations for his performance on the show—all of which he would lose, to [[Michael Richards]] for ''[[Seinfeld]]'', [[David Hyde Pierce]] for ''[[Frasier]]'', and his co-star [[Rip Torn]]. The character had the then-famous catch phrase "Hey Now!".

===''Arrested Development''===
Beginning in 2003, Tambor starred in the [[television comedy]] ''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]]'' as George Bluth, Sr. and in some episodes as his twin brother Oscar Bluth. The show was cancelled in 2006, after three seasons, but a fourth season was released on [[Netflix]] in 2013.

In 2004, Tambor received his fifth Emmy nomination for his work on the show. He lost to [[David Hyde Pierce]] for the final season of the sitcom ''[[Frasier]]''. Tambor was nominated for a sixth time in 2005 but lost to [[Brad Garrett]] for the final season of ''[[Everybody Loves Raymond]]''. The second episode of ''Arrested Development''&lt;nowiki/&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;'s third season lampooned this loss: Tambor's character's son describes his acting ability by saying, "It's a wonderful performance, Dad. You're a regular Brad Garrett."&lt;/nowiki&gt;

===Later work===
Tambor served as the announcer (and occasional square) for the game show ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'' in 2002 and 2003. He was also the voice of [[Neptune (mythology)|King Neptune]] in 2004's ''[[The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie]]''. In the spring of 2005, he starred as George Aaronow in the [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] revival of ''[[Glengarry Glen Ross]]''.

After the cancellation of ''Arrested Development'' in April 2006, Tambor signed on to a series with [[John Lithgow]] called ''[[Twenty Good Years]]'' about two men who ponder the last 20 years of their life. The show premiered on [[NBC]] on October 11, 2006, but was taken off the air after only a few episodes. Also in 2006, he portrayed [[George Washington]] on ''[[The Radio Adventures of Dr. Floyd]]''. He also starred as "Uncle" Saul in the [[CBS]] comedy ''[[Welcome to The Captain]]'' until its cancellation in March 2008. He has made several cameo appearances on ''[[Entourage (U.S. TV series)|Entourage]]'' as a fictionalized version of himself who regularly annoys his agent, [[Ari Gold (Entourage)|Ari Gold]].

For several years, based on his availability, Tambor has taught a class for actors. He was a longtime teaching associate of acting coach [[Milton Katselas]].

In 2009, Tambor appeared in the animated film ''[[Monsters vs. Aliens]]'' and in the comedy ''[[The Hangover]]''. In 2009, Tambor began playing the recurring character Len Trexler in the sardonic comedy ''[[Archer (TV series)|Archer]]'', an animated television series on the [[FX (TV channel)|FX]] network. He is a major love interest to Malory Archer played by [[Jessica Walter]] – the two formerly playing husband and wife in ''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]]''.

Tambor replaced [[Kelsey Grammer]] as Georges in the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] revival of the [[musical theatre|musical]] ''[[La Cage aux Folles (musical)#2010 Broadway revival|La Cage aux Folles]]'' on February 15, 2011, but withdrew from the production after the February 24 performance. Also in 2011, Tambor starred in an indie comedy, ''[[Lucky (2011 film)|Lucky]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Gina DiNunno | title=Colin Hanks and Jeffrey Tambor Get Lucky | url=http://movies.tvguide.com/Movie-News/Colin-Hanks-Jeffrey-1009466.aspx | work=TVGuide.com | date=September 4, 2009 | accessdate=September 8, 2009 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613045619/http://movies.tvguide.com/Movie-News/Colin-Hanks-Jeffrey-1009466.aspx | archivedate=June 13, 2010 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, he had a minor role in the film ''[[Paul (film)|Paul]]'' with [[Simon Pegg]] and [[Nick Frost]], reprised his ''Hangover'' role for its sequel, and was featured in ''[[Flypaper (2011 film)|Flypaper]]'', with [[Patrick Dempsey]] and [[Ashley Judd]].

In 2012, Tambor co-starred as Walt, Pete's aspiring musician father on the sitcom ''[[Bent (TV series)|Bent]]'' starring [[Amanda Peet]] and David Walton. In May 2013 he returned to ''Arrested Development'' for season 4.

In May 2017, Tambor released, ''Are You Anybody? A Memoir''.

===''Transparent''===

In February 2014, Amazon premiered its original series ''[[Transparent (TV series)|Transparent]]'', which starred Tambor as [[Maura Pfefferman]] (born Morton Pfefferman), a transgender, divorced, Jewish parent of three.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2014/02/11/amazon_s_new_pilots_transparent_mozart_in_the_jungle_the_after_the_rebels.html |title=Amazon Has Finally Made Its House of Cards |publisher=Slate |date=February 11, 2014 |accessdate=February 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tambor won the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Television Series Musical or Comedy|Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Television Series – Musical or Comedy]] for his portrayal and thanked the transgender community in his speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=Kristen Acuna| title=Jeffrey Tambor Thanks Trangender Community For 'Transparent' Golden Globe|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/golden-globes-jeffrey-tambor-wins-best-actor-transparent-2015-1| work=Business Insider|date=January 11, 2015|accessdate=January 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He won the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series]] for his performance in season 1 of the show, his first win in 7 [[Primetime Emmy Award]] nominations. This made him the first actor to win an Emmy for portraying a transgender character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.takepart.com/article/2015/09/20/transparent-scored-historic-emmys-win |title=‘Transparent’ Creator Jill Soloway Just Made a Big Stand for Transgender Rights |publisher=TakePart |date= |accessdate=2015-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the show's second season, Tambor again received positive reviews, as well as a nomination for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Television Series Musical or Comedy]], and wins for the [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Comedy Series]] and the [[Critics' Choice Television Award for Best Actor in a Comedy Series]].

Following allegations of sexual harassment, Tambor said he will not return for the show's fifth season,&lt;ref name="DeadlineTambor"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Patten|first1=Dominic|title=Jeffrey Tambor Exits 'Transparent' After Sexual Harassment Allegations|url=http://deadline.com/2017/11/jeffrey-tambor-leaving-transparent-sexual-harassment-allegations-amazon-jill-soloway-1202211711/|accessdate=November 20, 2017|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=November 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was later confirmed on February 15, 2018 when Amazon confirmed to Deadline that Tambor was not coming back and that the harassment investigation was recently concluded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Patten|first1=Dominic|title=Jeffrey Tambor Officially Out At ‘Transparent’ After Harassment Claims|url=http://deadline.com/2018/02/jeffrey-tambor-out-transparent-amazon-series-harassment-investigation-1202290473/|website=Deadline Hollywood|accessdate=15 February 2018|date=15 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Harassment allegations==

===Sexual misconduct allegations===
On November 8, 2017, Tambor was accused of sexual misconduct by his former assistant, Van Barnes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://deadline.com/2017/11/jeffrey-tambor-sexual-harassment-claims-amazon-1202204220/|title=Jeffrey Tambor Being Investigated By Amazon On Sexual Harassment Claims; Actor 'Adamantly' Denies Allegations|date=November 8, 2017|website=Deadline Hollywood|last=Patten|first= Dominic}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 16, 2017, actress [[Trace Lysette]] additionally made accusations against Tambor. Tambor responded, "I am deeply sorry if any action of mine was ever misinterpreted by anyone as being sexually aggressive or if I ever offended or hurt anyone. But the fact is, for all my flaws, I am not a predator and the idea that someone might see me in that way is more distressing than I can express."&lt;ref name=DeadlineActorAdmits&gt;{{cite news|url=http://deadline.com/2017/11/jeffrey-tambor-sexual-harassment-claims-trace-lysette-transparent-actress-amazon-1202210145/|title=Jeffrey Tambor Accused By 'Transparent' Actress Of Sexual Harassment; Actor Admits 'Flaws,' Says 'Misinterpreted'|date=November 16, 2017|website=Deadline Hollywood|last=Patten|first= Dominic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Days later, makeup artist Tamara Delbridge also accused Tambor of sexual improprieties on the set of the 2001 film ''[[Never Again (2001 film)|Never Again]]''. Tambor said he did not recall the incident, but apologized "for any discomfort or offense I may have inadvertently caused her."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/makeup-artist-accuses-jeffrey-tambor-misconduct-set-2001s-never-again-1061163|title=Makeup Artist Accuses Jeffrey Tambor of Misconduct on Set of 2001's 'Never Again'|date=November 22, 2017|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|last=Jang|first= Meena}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By this time, Tambor had left ''Transparent'', saying in a statement on November 19, "Playing Maura Pfefferman on ''Transparent'' has been one of the greatest privileges and creative experiences of my life. What has become clear over the past weeks, however, is that this is no longer the job I signed up for four years ago. I’ve already made clear my deep regret if any action of mine was ever misinterpreted by anyone as being aggressive, but the idea that I would deliberately harass anyone is simply and utterly untrue. Given the politicized atmosphere that seems to have afflicted our set, I don’t see how I can return to ''Transparent''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/jeffrey-tambor-says-hes-leaving-transparent-harassment-claims-1059104|date=November 19, 2017 |first1=Lesley |last1=Goldberg|first2=Jackie |last2=Strause|title=Jeffrey Tambor Says He's Leaving 'Transparent' Amid Harassment Claims|work=The Hollywood Reporter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The allegations came after filming for the fifth season of ''Arrested Development'' had completed that same month. The show's team has supported Tambor in defending the allegations, and affirmed his scenes will remain within the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.tvguide.com/news/jeffrey-tambor-arrested-development-season-5/ | title = Jeffrey Tambor Will Appear in Arrested Development Season 5 Despite Sexual Misconduct Claims | first = Liam | last = Mathews | date = May 4, 2018 | accessdate = May 4, 2018 | work = [[TV Guide]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Response====
In his first interview since being released from ''Transparent'', Tambor, speaking to ''The Hollywood Reporter'' in early May, continued to deny allegations that he had sexually harassed his former assistant or Trace Lysette on the series, but admitted to having anger issues throughout his life. He also said that while he was on the show he "worried [himself] to death" about whether he was portraying his transgender character truthfully, and that the stress sometimes made him "difficult" and "mean".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first=Aurelie|last=Corinthios |url=http://people.com/tv/jeffrey-tambor-talks-sexual-harassment-allegations-transparent-firing/ |title=Jeffrey Tambor Denies Sexual Harassment Allegations But Admits He Was 'Difficult' and 'Mean' |work=[[People (magazine)|People]] |publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]]|location=New York City|date=May 8, 2018 |accessdate=May 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Verbal harassment allegation===
On May 23, 2018, Tambor's ''Arrested Development'' co-star [[Jessica Walter]] said in a ''New York Times'' cast interview that Tambor had verbally harassed her. “He never crossed the line on our show, with any, you know, sexual whatever. Verbally, yes, he harassed me, but he did apologize, In like almost 60 years of working, I’ve never had anybody yell at me like that on a set.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Sopan|last=Deb|title=We Sat Down With the ‘Arrested Development’ Cast.

This is horrific.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Tambor has an adult daughter from an earlier relationship. He and his wife Kasia have son Gabriel Kasper, younger daughter Eve Julia, and twin sons Hugo Bernard and Eli Nicholas, born on October 4, 2009.&lt;ref name=People2009&gt;{{cite news|url=http://people.com/babies/its-a-boy-and-a-boy-for-jeffrey-tambor/|title=It's a Boy – and a Boy – for Jeffrey Tambor|work=[[People (magazine)|People]] |publisher=[[Time Inc.]] | date=October 13, 2009|accessdate= November 19, 2017|quote=...Tambor’s rep tells ''People''.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Tambor was reported to be a [[Scientology|Scientologist]].&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news |first=Mark |last=Oppenheimer |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/15/magazine/15Katselas-t.html?pagewanted=5&amp;_r=2 |title=Something happened |work=New York Times |date=July 15, 2007 |accessdate=January 5, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in February 2008, Tambor expressed concern about "Internet reports" about his alleged involvement with Scientology and stated that he "took some Scientology classes at one time, studied Scientology for a while, but no more. I have nothing against it, but I am no longer a Scientologist."&lt;ref&gt;Beck, Marilyn and Jenel, Stacy (February 4, 2008).
