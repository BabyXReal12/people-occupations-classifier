'''Stefan Konrad Raab''' (born 20 October 1966) is a German entertainer, comedian, musician and former television host. Raab began his television career hosting the comedy show ''[[Vivasion]]'' in 1993. He became well known in 1994 after composing a hit single spoofing national football coach [[Berti Vogts]]. From 1999 to 2015, he hosted the [[late-night talk show|late-night]] comedy show ''[[TV total]]'' and has also created a number of other television shows, such as ''[[Schlag den Raab]]'' and ''[[Bundesvision Song Contest]]''. In the early 2010s, Raab was considered the "most powerful man in German entertainment television".&lt;ref name="Spiegel 2011"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-76862428.html|title=Die Geiseln des Metzgers|publisher=''[[Spiegel online]]''|date=14 February 2011|accessdate=8 May 2011|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Raab is also known for his recurring role as producer, writer and performer of German entries to the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] beginning in 1998. He was the initiator of the national pre-selection show [[Germany in the Eurovision Song Contest 2010|Unser Star für Oslo]] (Our Star for Oslo), in which [[Satellite (Lena Meyer-Landrut song)|Germany's winning entry]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2010|2010 contest]] in Oslo was determined.

==Early life and family==
Raab grew up in [[Cologne]] with his sister and his parents, who owned a butchers shop. He attended [[Jesuit]] boarding school [[Aloisiuskolleg]] in Bonn. Before entering the entertainment business, he worked as a butcher in his parents' shop and studied [[law school|law]] before dropping-out of university after five semesters.&lt;ref name="Stefan Raab biography at laut.de"/&gt; Raab lives in a suburb of Cologne and has two daughters (born 2004 and 2006) with his girlfriend Nike.&lt;ref name="Welt-Vater"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/vermischtes/article152925/Stefan_Raab_wird_zum_zweiten_Mal_Vater.html|title=Stefan Raab wird zum zweiten Mal Vater|publisher=''[[Die Welt]]''|date=15 September 2006|accessdate=30 March 2010|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other than this, very little is known about Raab, who deliberately hides his private life from the media.

==Career==
=== Television ===
Stefan Raab became popular as host of the comedy show ''Vivasion'' for the German [[music television]] channel [[Viva (TV station)|VIVA]] from 1993 to 1998.&lt;ref name="zeit"/&gt;

In 1999, he created ''TV total'' which began airing in April 2001 on [[ProSieben]], four times a week. While ''TV total'' started as a comedy format mainly showing and satirizing funny and embarrassing sequences from other television programs, it soon came to be more of a late night show featuring musical performances-- in some ways similar to ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'' or ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]''.&lt;ref name="zeit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stefan Raab biography at tvtotal.de"&gt;[http://tvtotal.prosieben.de/tvtotal/infos/stefan/04176.html Stefan Raab biography]. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131126110351/http://tvtotal.prosieben.de/tvtotal/infos/stefan/04176.html|date=2013-11-26}} tvtotal.de. Accessed 30 March 2010. {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a [[boxing]] match against [[Regina Halmich]] in 2001 (rematch 2007) and a [[speed skating]] race against [[Claudia Pechstein]] in 2002, he also created several other celebrity sports events that are produced regularly, including ''TV total Turmspringen'' ([[high diving]]) and ''TV total Stock Car Crash Challenge'' ([[stock car racing]]). He also brought fun and variety to the show by invented new sports: In November 2003, he initiated the first "official" World [[Wok racing]] Championship in [[Winterberg]], Germany. Modified Chinese woks are used to make timed runs down an Olympic bobsled track. The championship has taken place every year since, most recently in March 2011 in [[Innsbruck]].&lt;ref name="Stefan Raab biography at tvtotal.de"/&gt; The first ''Autoball EM'', autoball being a version of football played in cars and using an [[exercise ball]] to score goals was made in 2007.&lt;ref name="Stefan Raab biography at mtv.de"/&gt;

In 2006, Raab invented the game show ''[[Schlag den Raab]]'' (German for ''Beat the Raab'', remade for British television as [[Beat the Star]] and as "Beat your ''host''" in several other European countries), in which he competes against a contestant in various disciplines – some episodes of the show lasted more than five hours with excellent quotas.

Raab frequently organizes ''PokerStars.de Nacht'', a poker event featuring some celebrity names in German entertainment.&lt;ref name="Stefan Raab biography at tvtotal.de"/&gt;

In September 2012, he announced that he will be hosting a new talk show on [[ProSieben]] which will include political guests and begin airing on 11 November 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/tv/stefan-raab-moderator-plant-neue-talkshow-gegen-guenther-jauch-a-854750.html |title=Stefan Raab: Moderator plant neue Talkshow gegen Guenther Jauch |publisher=spiegel.de |language=German |date=9 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It will stand in direct competition with the self-titled talk show hosted by [[Günther Jauch]].

In September 2013 Raab was one of four hosts (one from each big television network) at the federal election debate between chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] and her challenger [[Peer Steinbrück]].

In mid-2015, Raab announced his retirement from television and stated that he would remain hosting until the end of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tz.de/tv/stefan-raab-beendet-seine-tv-karriere-ende-jahres-zr-5121761.html |title=Stefan Raab beendet seine TV-Karriere zum Ende des Jahres |publisher=TZ |date=2015-08-28 |accessdate=2015-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last episode of his show ''TV total'' aired on 16 December and the last episode of ''[[Schlag den Raab]]'' aired on 19 December 2015.

===Music===
[[File:Opening act 2, ESC 2011.jpg|right|thumb|Raab performing [[Satellite (Lena Meyer-Landrut song)|Satellite]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2011]] ]]
Raab began working as a freelance producer and composer of jingles and radio commercials in 1990 at his own studio in Cologne.&lt;ref name="Stefan Raab biography at laut.de"&gt;[http://www.laut.de/Stefan-Raab Stefan Raab biography]. laut.de. Accessed 30 March 2010. {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1994 onwards, he produced a number of popular songs, including "Böörti Böörti Vogts" (a song about [[Berti Vogts]]), "Hier kommt die Maus" ("Here comes the mouse", a tribute to the children's television series [[Die Sendung mit der Maus]]), "[[Maschendrahtzaun]]", "Wir kiffen", "Gebt das Hanf frei!" ("Legalise Dope!", featuring [[Shaggy (artist)|Shaggy]] and samples from German politician [[Hans-Christian Ströbele]]), "Hol' mir ma' 'ne Flasche Bier" ("Get me a bottle o' beer", containing samples from then-Chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]]), and "Space Taxi" from the soundtrack of the movie [[Traumschiff Surprise - Periode 1]].&lt;ref name="Stefan Raab biography at mtv.de"&gt;[http://www.mtv.de/music/184852-stefan-raab/bio Stefan Raab biography]. mtv.de. Accessed 30 March 2010. {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He wrote the song for the German entry to the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1998]], [[Guildo Horn]]'s "[[Guildo hat euch lieb!]]",&lt;ref name="Stefan Raab biography at tvtotal.de"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Germany country profile at eurovision.tv"&gt;[http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-country/country?country=9 Germany country profile at eurovision.tv]. eurovision.tv. Accessed 30 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2000]] he took part himself, performing the [[nonsense]] song "[[Wadde hadde dudde da?]]".&lt;ref name="Germany country profile at eurovision.tv"/&gt; Raab cast the German entry for the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2004|2004 Eurovision Song Contest]] in a talent show contest called ''SSDSGPS'' ("Stefan sucht den Super-Grand-Prix-Star", "Stefan seeks the super Grand-Prix star", satirising the title of the German [[Idol series]] [[Deutschland sucht den Superstar]], ''DSDS'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://brainpool.tv/bpo/en/presse/pressemitteilungen/index_20040320_16722.html Max goes to Istanbul!]. brainpool.tv. Accessed 30 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The winner, [[Maximilian Mutzke]], came in eighth place.&lt;ref name="Germany country profile at eurovision.tv"/&gt;

Bored with the Eurovision Song Contest, Raab came up with the [[Bundesvision Song Contest]] in 2005 (''Bundes''republik Deutschland = Federal Republic of Germany). The contest features representatives from each of the 16 [[states of Germany]] and stipulates that their song has to be at least partly in German.

In 2009, Raab was approached by the public broadcaster [[Norddeutscher Rundfunk|NDR]], a member of the [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]] broadcasting consortium, to jointly organise a national preselection in order to determine the German entry for the Eurovision Song Contest 2010. It was revealed that Raab initially refused the request, but that his television network ProSieben accepted the offer to work with ARD/NDR.&lt;ref&gt;Solloso, Jaime. [http://www.oikotimes.com/v2/index.php?file=articles&amp;id=5867 Germany prepares for 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090527163355/http://www.oikotimes.com/v2/index.php?file=articles&amp;id=5867 |date=27 May 2009 }}. oikotimes.com. 25 May 2009. Accessed 30 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the cooperation, the talent show contest Unser Star für Oslo (''Our Star for Oslo'') took place from 2 February 2010 onwards, stretching across 8 shows. Raab took a lead role in the programmes as head of the jury. In the national final on 12 March 2010, [[Lena Meyer-Landrut]] emerged as winner.&lt;ref&gt;Brey, Marco.

Accessed 30 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 May 2010, Meyer-Landrut won the Eurovision Song Contest 2010 with the song "[[Satellite (Lena Meyer-Landrut song)|Satellite]]", claiming the first German Eurovision victory in 28 years.&lt;ref name="Lena wins Eurovision Eurovision.tv"&gt;Schacht, Andreas.

As a musician, Raab is an [[autodidact]], playing various instruments, such as piano, drums, guitar, [[ukulele]], and some wind instruments.&lt;ref name="zeit"&gt;Schüle, Christian.

Accessed 27 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the initiator and president of the jury of the show ''[[Unser Star für Oslo]]'' he was awarded the ''[[Bayerischer Fernsehpreis]]'' (Bavarian television award) in 2010.

On 12 November 2011, Stefan Raab came second in Synchronised diving, teaming with ''[[Elton_(comedian)|Elton]]'' in Munich, at the TV Total Turmspringen 2011 event. This was his first ever podium along with Elton at this event.

==Controversies==
Raab has been the subject of [[lawsuit]]s throughout his career, some of which have gained public attention. The two most referenced cases are:
*The case of then 16-year-old model Lisa Loch, who was ridiculed during some shows through Raab's assertion that her name ("Loch" meaning "hole" in German) made her more likely to find a job as an actress in [[pornographic movie]]s. Loch claimed she received anonymous obscene telephone calls, was mocked by classmates and in public and as a result suffered sleeplessness and was afraid to leave her home. A court in [[Hamm]] ordered Raab to pay €70,000 in compensation due to infringement of personal rights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/0,1518,284903,00.html Raab zu 70.000 Euro Schadenersatz verurteilt]. spiegel.de. 4 February 2004. Accessed 30 March 2010. {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In an episode broadcast on 6 September 2004, Raab showed a clip, originally destined for a news broadcast, of a 28-year-old [[Turkish people|Turkish]] mother Nil S. holding a [[Schultüte]] (a cardboard cone, typically full of sweets, traditionally given to children in Germany on their first school day). Raab's comment, "Unbelievable! The [[drug trafficker]]s are disguising themselves better and better" ("eine Tüte" also means "a [[marijuana joint]]" in German slang, hence the pun), resulted in repeated lawsuits, and after a [[Munich]] court ruled against Raab, Nil S. settled for €20,000 compensation accompanied by a written apology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stern.de/lifestyle/leute/beleidigungsklage-raab-spart-130000-euro-557968.html?q=Stefan+Raab Raab spart 130.000 Euro]. stern.de. 20 March 2006.
