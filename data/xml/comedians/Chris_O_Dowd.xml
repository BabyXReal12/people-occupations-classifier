==Early life==
O'Dowd was born and raised in [[Boyle, County Roscommon]]. His father, Seán, is a graphic designer, and his mother, Denise, is a counsellor and psychotherapist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/esmagazine/chris-odowd-from-cult-it-geek-to-hollywood-antihero-6412084.html|title=Chris O'Dowd: From cult IT geek to Hollywood antihero|author=Laura Barton|date=16 June 2011|publisher=[[London Evening Standard]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph interview"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/starsandstories/8579986/Chris-ODowd-Interview.html|title=Chris O'Dowd Interview|author=Stuart Husband|date=20 June 2011|accessdate=19 October 2012|publisher=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sligochampion.ie/news/boyle-boyle-actor-in-television-debut-938291.html|title=Boyle: Boyle actor in television debut|date=8 January 2003|publisher=[[The Sligo Champion]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the youngest of five siblings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/may/18/chris-odowd-it-crowd-bridesmaids|title=Chris O'Dowd: from The IT Crowd to Hollywood|author=Hadley Freeman|date=|work=the Guardian|accessdate=4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He represented Roscommon in [[Gaelic football]] at the under-16, minor and under-21 levels, the highlight being his performance as a goalkeeper in the 1997 Connacht Minor final against Mayo. This was highlighted by his guest appearance on the Sunday Game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.farmersjournal.ie/site/farming-Roscommon%E2%80%99s-IT-guy-9440.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130412223342/http://www.farmersjournal.ie/site/farming-Roscommon%E2%80%99s-IT-guy-9440.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=12 April 2013 |title=Farm - Farming - Roscommon’s IT guy |publisher=Farmersjournal.ie |accessdate=4 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He studied politics and sociology at [[University College Dublin]], and subsequently attended the [[London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art]]. O'Dowd did not obtain a degree from UCD, telling the UCD student newspaper the ''College Tribune'': "I didn't finish my degree. The politics part of it was fine, but I was doing sociology as well and I could never bring myself to find an interest in it."&lt;ref name="collegetribune"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collegetribune.ie/chris-o-dowd-talks-to-donie-o-sullivan|title= Standing out from the Crowd|author=Donie O'Sullivan|date=4 April 2012|publisher=[[College Tribune]]|accessdate=19 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He contributed to ''[[The University Observer]]'', [[Ógra Fianna Fáil]] and was active in UCD Dramsoc and the [[Literary and Historical Society (University College Dublin)|Literary and Historical Society]].&lt;ref name="collegetribune"/&gt; O'Dowd was an avid member of [[Ógra Fianna Fáil]] and engaged in promotional canvassing for the party amongst UCD's student populace, it was during this time he coined the slogan 'Vote Young Fianna Fáil, for [[hurling]] in the halls'. The slogan was a huge success thanks to O'Dowd's improvisation with classmate Ronan Kirby's hurley. O'Dowd revealed to ''The College Tribune''&lt;ref name="collegetribune"/&gt; that he was personally thanked by [[de Valera]]'s ghost in a dream.

==Career==
[[File:Chris O'Dowd.jpg|thumb|O'Dowd at Lingerie London in 2012]]

He starred in the 2009 film ''[[The Boat That Rocked]]'', released in Canada and the U.S. as ''Pirate Radio''. The film was inspired by the story of offshore pirate broadcasters [[Radio Caroline]]. O'Dowd plays Simon, the station's breakfast DJ."The breakfast jock on Radio Caroline at the time was Tony Blackburn, so there's definitely an element of him in it,"&lt;ref name="suicidegirls"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://suicidegirls.com/interviews/Chris+O'Dowd%3A+The+IT+Man+From+The+IT+Crowd|title=Chris O'Dowd: The IT Man From The IT Crowd|author=Nicole Powers|date=9 May 2009|publisher=[[SuicideGirls]]|accessdate=19 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; says O'Dowd of his character. "And then I called in different Irish DJs that would have been contemporaries of Tony Blackburn at the time, a guy called [[Larry Gogan]] and a couple of other people."&lt;ref name="suicidegirls"/&gt;

O'Dowd starred opposite [[Sienna Miller]] in the film ''[[Hippie Hippie Shake]]'', which is about the groundbreaking '60s magazine, ''[[Oz (magazine)|Oz]]''.

"It's shooting in [[Pinewood Studios|Pinewood]] from the end of April", he said, shortly after his participation was announced. "I'm just going back to England to learn how to ride a horse... I'm a general in the army, so there's going to be a little bit of horse riding. I think it's going to be really fun though, we're all kind of learning together."&lt;ref name="suicidegirls"/&gt;

Despite being raised in a [[Roman Catholic]] family, O'Dowd has been a lifelong [[atheist]], and has developed an [[antitheist]] philosophy as he has aged.
