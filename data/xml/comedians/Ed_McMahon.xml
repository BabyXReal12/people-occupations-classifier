'''Edward Leo Peter McMahon Jr.''' (March 6, 1923 – June 23, 2009) was an American announcer, game show host, comedian, actor and singer. McMahon and [[Johnny Carson]] began their association in their first TV series, the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] game show ''[[Who Do You Trust?]]'', running from 1957 to 1962. Then afterwards, McMahon would make his famous thirty-year mark as Carson's [[Sidekick#In television|sidekick]], [[announcer]] and [[second banana]] on [[NBC]]'s ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' from 1962 to 1992.

He also hosted the original ''[[Star Search]]'' from 1983 to 1995, co-hosted ''[[TV's Bloopers &amp; Practical Jokes]]'' with [[Dick Clark]] from 1982 to 1998 and also presented sweepstakes for the direct marketing company [[American Family Publishers]] (not, as is commonly believed, its main rival [[Publishers Clearing House]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.pch.com/winners_circle/2009/03/setting-the-record-straight-on-ed-mcmahon.html |title=Setting the Record Straight on Ed McMahon |accessdate=2009-06-24 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090629213724/http://blog.pch.com/winners_circle/2009/03/setting-the-record-straight-on-ed-mcmahon.html |archivedate=June 29, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}, [[Publishers Clearing House]] official blog, by Dave Sayer, March 15, 2009. (via [[archive.org]])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Joel Keller]], "[http://www.tvsquad.com/2009/06/23/ed-mcmahon-did-not-work-for-publishers-clearing-house/ Ed McMahon did not work for Publishers Clearing House]," ''[[TV Squad]]'', June 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; McMahon annually co-hosted the ''[[The Jerry Lewis MDA Labor Day Telethon|Jerry Lewis MDA Telethon]]'' from 1973 to 2008. In the 1970s and 80s, he anchored the team of NBC personalities conducting the network's coverage of the [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]].

McMahon appeared in several films, including ''[[The Incident (1967 film)|The Incident]]'', ''[[Fun with Dick and Jane (1977 film)|Fun With Dick and Jane]]'', ''[[Full Moon High]]'' and ''[[Butterfly (1982 film)|Butterfly]]'', as well as briefly in the [[Bewitched (2005 film)|film version of ''Bewitched'']]. He also performed in numerous television commercials. According to ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', McMahon is considered one of the greatest "sidekicks".&lt;ref&gt;Ben Schott, ''Schott's Mischellany Calendar 2009'' (New York: Workman Publishing, 2008)&lt;!-- ISBN, page(s) needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
McMahon was born in [[Detroit]], Michigan, to Edward Leo Peter McMahon Sr., a fund-raiser and entertainer, and his wife Eleanor (Russell) McMahon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/55/Ed-McMahon.html|title=Ed McMahon Biography (1923–2009)|accessdate=January 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was raised in [[Lowell, Massachusetts]], often visiting his paternal Aunt Mary Brennan at her home on Chelmsford St. McMahon began his career as a bingo caller in [[Maine]] when he was fifteen. Prior to this, he worked as a [[carnival barker]] for three years in [[Mexico, Maine]]. He put himself through college as a [[pitchman]] for vegetable slicers on the [[Atlantic City]] boardwalk. His first broadcasting job was at [[WLLH]]-AM in his native Lowell and he began his television career in [[Philadelphia]] at [[WCAU-TV]].&lt;ref name="Philadelphia"/&gt;

===Military service===
McMahon hoped to become a [[United States Marine Corps]] fighter pilot. Prior to the US entry into [[World War II]], however, both the [[U.S. Army|Army]] and [[U. S. Navy|Navy]] required two years of college for their pilots program. McMahon enrolled into classes at [[Boston College]] and studied there from 1940 to 1941. On ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'' in 2001, McMahon stated that after [[Pearl Harbor]] was attacked, the college requirement was not lifted and he still had to finish his two years of college before applying for Marine Corps flight training.

After completing the college requirement, McMahon was able to enlist as he previously wished.  His primary flight training was in Dallas, followed by fighter training in [[Pensacola]], where he also earned his carrier landing qualifications. He was a Marine Corps flight instructor in F4U Corsairs for two years, finally being ordered to the Pacific fleet in 1945. However, his orders were canceled after the atomic bomb was dropped on [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]], forcing Japan's surrender unconditionally.

As an officer in the reserves, McMahon was recalled to active duty during the [[Korean War]]. This time, he flew the OE-1 (the original Marine designation for the [[Cessna O-1 Bird Dog]]), an unarmed single-engine spotter plane. He functioned as an artillery spotter for the Marine batteries on the ground and as a forward controller for the Navy and Marine fighter bombers. He flew a total of 85 combat missions, earning six [[Air Medal]]s. After the war, he stayed with the Marines as a reserve officer, retiring in 1966 as a [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]]. In 1982, McMahon received a state commission as a [[Brigadier General (United States)|brigadier general]] in the [[California Air National Guard]], an honorary award to recognize his support for the National Guard and Reserves.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Deseret News]]'', [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=qlwzAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=U4MDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5765,6631909&amp;dq=ed-mcmahon+national-guard+california&amp;hl=en "It's General Ed"], February 24, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jerry Buck, Associated Press, ''Youngstown Vindicator'', [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=UiZcAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=WlUNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4931,4589060&amp;dq=ed-mcmahon+national-guard+california&amp;hl=en "Shows Keep McMahon Busy Despite Vows to 'Slow Down'"], January 15, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Catholic University of America===
After World War II, McMahon studied at [[The Catholic University of America]]  under the [[GI Bill]] and  graduated in 1949.  He majored in speech and drama while studying under the Rev. [[Gilbert Hartke]] and was a member of [[Phi Kappa Theta]] fraternity. After graduation, McMahon led the effort to raise funds for a theater to be named for Hartke and attended its dedication in 1970 with [[Helen Hayes]] and [[Sidney Poitier]].&lt;ref name=CUA/&gt; While working as Carson's sidekick during ''The Tonight Show'', McMahon served as the president of the national alumni association from 1967 to 1971 and would often return to campus, especially for homecoming.&lt;ref name=CUA/&gt;  During the University's centennial celebration in 1987, McMahon and [[Bob Newhart]] performed.&lt;ref name=CUA/&gt;  He received an honorary Doctor of Communication Arts in 1988.

"I owe so much to CU," McMahon once said. "That's where my career got its start."&lt;ref name=CUA/&gt; Today, the Ed McMahon Endowed Scholarship helps outstanding students and provides scholarship assistance to juniors and seniors who are pursuing a bachelor's degree in either the Department of Drama or the Department of Media Studies within the School of Arts and Sciences.&lt;ref name=CUA/&gt;

==Entertainment career==

===''Who Do You Trust?''===
McMahon and Carson first worked together as announcer and host on the ABC daytime game show ''[[Who Do You Trust?]]'' running from 1957 to 1962.

===''The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson''===
The pair joined ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' on October 1, 1962 on NBC. He describes what happened when the pair first met, the whole meeting being "about as exciting as watching a traffic light change".&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.bingohall.com/5-years-since-the-departure-of-ed-mcmahon-the-most-famous-bingo-caller/ Ed McMahon Obituary].&lt;/ref&gt; For almost 30 years, McMahon introduced the show with a drawn-out "Heeere's Johnny!" His booming voice and constant laughter alongside the "King of Late Night" earned McMahon the [[nickname]] the "Human [[Laugh Track]]" and "Toymaker to the King". As part of the introductory patter to ''The Tonight Show'', McMahon would state his name out loud, pronouncing it as {{IPAc-en|m|ᵻ|k|ˈ|m|eɪ|.|ən}}, but neither long-time cohort Carson nor anyone else who interviewed him ever seemed to [[æ-tensing|pick up on that subtlety]], usually pronouncing his name {{IPAc-en|m|ᵻ|k|ˈ|m|æ|n}}.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Aside from his co-hosting duties, it also fell upon McMahon during the early years of Carson's tenure (when the show ran 105 minutes) to host the first fifteen minutes of ''Tonight'', which did not air nationally. McMahon also served as guest host on at least one occasion, substituting for Carson during a week of programs that aired between July 29 and August 2, 1963, and again for two nights in October 1963. McMahon served as a counter to the notoriously shy Carson. Nonetheless, McMahon once told an interviewer that after his many decades as an emcee, he would still get "butterflies" in his stomach every time he would walk onto a stage and would use that nervousness as a source of energy. {{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

His famous opening line, "Heeere's Johnny!", was used in the 1980 horror film ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'' by the character [[Jack Torrance]] (played by [[Jack Nicholson]]) as he goes after his wife and child with an axe. He did in-program commercials for many sponsors of ''The Tonight Show'', most notably [[Budweiser]] beer and [[Alpo (pet food)|Alpo]] dog food, and also did commercials for them that ran on other programs.

===''Star Search''===
McMahon was also host of the successful weekly [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] series ''[[Star Search]]'', which began in 1983 and helped launch the careers of numerous actors, singers, choreographers and comedians. He stayed with the show until it ended in 1995 and in 2003, he made a cameo appearance on the [[Columbia Broadcasting System|CBS]] revival of the series, hosted by his successor [[Arsenio Hall]].

===Other roles===
[[File:Ed mcmahon 1990.jpg|thumb|right|McMahon at the premiere of ''[[Air America (film)|Air America]]'' in 1990]]
His long association with brewer [[Anheuser-Busch]] earned him the nickname "Mr. Budweiser" and he used that relationship to bring them aboard as one of the largest corporate donors to the [[Muscular Dystrophy Association]]. Since 1973, McMahon served as co-host of the long-running live annual [[Labor Day]] weekend event of the ''[[The Jerry Lewis MDA Labor Day Telethon|Jerry Lewis MDA Telethon]]''. His 41st and final appearance on that show was in 2008, making him second only to [[Jerry Lewis]] himself in number of appearances.&lt;ref name="MDA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mda.org/news/090623mcmahon.html|title=Longtime MDA Telethon Anchor Ed McMahon Dies|publisher=[[Muscular Dystrophy Association|MDA]]|date=June 23, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017202837/http://static.mda.org/news/090623mcmahon.html|archivedate=October 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; McMahon and [[Dick Clark]] hosted the television series (and later special broadcasts of) ''[[TV's Bloopers and Practical Jokes]]'' on [[NBC]] from 1982 to 1993. {{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

In 1967, McMahon had a role in the film ''[[The Incident (1967 film)|The Incident]]'' and appeared as Santa Clause on ''The Mitzi Gaynor Christmas Show''. From 1965 to 1969, McMahon served as "communicator" (host) of the Saturday afternoon segment of ''[[Monitor (NBC Radio)|Monitor]]'', the weekend news, features and entertainment magazine on the [[NBC Radio Network]]. The 1955 movie ''Dementia'', which has music without dialogue, was released as ''Daughter of Horror'' in 1970. The newer version, which had a voice over by McMahon, still has music without dialogue, but with an added narration read by him. McMahon had a supporting role in the original ''[[Fun with Dick and Jane (1977 film)|Fun with Dick and Jane]]'' in 1977.

He then played himself in "''Remote Control Man''", a season one episode of [[Steven Spielberg]]'s ''[[Amazing Stories (TV series)|Amazing Stories]]''. In 2004, McMahon became the announcer and co-host of ''[[Alf's Hit Talk Show]]'' on [[TV Land]]. He has authored two memoirs, ''Here's Johnny!: My Memories of Johnny Carson, The Tonight Show, and 46 Years of Friendship'' as well as ''For Laughing Out Loud''. Over the years, he [[emcee]]d the game shows ''[[Missing Links (game show)|Missing Links]]'', ''[[Snap Judgment (game show)|Snap Judgment]]'', ''[[Concentration (game show)|Concentration]]'', and ''[[Whodunnit! (game show)|Whodunnit!]]''.

McMahon also hosted ''[[Lifestyles Live]]'', a weekend talk program aired on the [[USA Radio Network]]. Additionally, he also appeared in the feature documentary film, ''[[Pitch People (1999 film)|Pitch People]]'', the first motion picture to take an in-depth look at the history and evolution of pitching products to the public. In the early 2000s, McMahon made a series of [[Neighborhood Watch]] [[public service announcement]]s parodying the surprise appearances to contest winners that he was supposedly known for. (In fact, it is not clear whether the company McMahon fronted, American Family Publishers, regularly performed such unannounced visits, as opposed to Publishers Clearing House and its oft-promoted "prize patrol".)

Towards the end of the decade, McMahon took on other endorsement roles, playing a rapper for a [[FreeCreditReport.com]] commercial&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/SHOWBIZ/09/25/people.ed.mcmahon.ap |title=Ed McMahon turns gangsta rapper |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=September 25, 2008 |accessdate=September 25, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080929032828/http://www.cnn.com/2008/SHOWBIZ/09/25/people.ed.mcmahon.ap/ |archivedate=September 29, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in a ''[[Cash4Gold]]'' commercial alongside [[MC Hammer]]. McMahon was also the spokesman for [[Pride Mobility]], a leading power wheelchair and scooter manufacturer. His final film appearance was in the independent John Hughes themed rom-com ''[[jelly (film)|Jelly]]'' as Mr. Closure alongside  actress [[Natasha Lyonne]]. Mostly in the 1980s through the 1990s, McMahon was the spokesperson for [[Colonial Penn]] Life Insurance Company.&lt;ref name="MDA" /&gt;

==Personal life==

===Marriage and children===
McMahon married Alyce Ferrell on July 5, 1945, while he was serving as a flight instructor in the Marines.&lt;ref name=Wise1999&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wise|first1=James E.|last2=Rehill|first2=Anne Collier|title=Stars in the corps: movie actors in the United States Marines|year=1999|publisher=Naval Institute Press|isbn=978-1-55750-949-9|pages=133–138}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had four children: Claudia (b. 1946), Michael Edward (1951–1995), Linda and Jeffrey.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ssdi.rootsweb.ancestry.com Social Security Death Index]&lt;/ref&gt; They separated in  1972 and divorced in 1974.&lt;ref name=Gliatto1991&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gliatto|first=Tom|author2=Doris Bacon|date=September 9, 1991|title=Ed Over Heels|journal=People|volume=36|issue=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; McMahon married Victoria Valentine on March 6, 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McMahon|first1=Ed|last2=Fisher|first2=David|title=For Laughing Out Loud: My Life and Good Times|year=1999|page=290}}&lt;/ref&gt; They adopted a daughter in 1985, Katherine Mary. The couple divorced in 1989. McMahon paid $50,000 per month in spousal and child support.&lt;ref name=Laufenberg1999&gt;{{cite book|last=Laufenberg|first=Norbert B.|title=Entertainment Celebrities|year=2005|publisher=Trafford Publishing|isbn=978-1-4120-5335-8|page=442}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 22, 1992, three months before his ''Tonight Show'' run came to a close, in a ceremony held near Las Vegas,&lt;ref name=Laufenberg1999/&gt; McMahon married Pamela "Pam" Hurn, a 37-year-old mother of a son named Alex. McMahon's daughter Katherine served as best person at the wedding. {{citation needed|date=May 2017}} McMahon was a longtime summer resident of [[Avalon, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;Browne, Greg. [https://web.archive.org/web/20120313115100/http://www.nbc40.net/view_story.php?id=9701 "ED MCMAHON DIES; HAD STRONG TIES TO AVALON"], [[WMGM-TV]], June 23, 2009; accessed August 23, 2015. "For 30 years, Ed McMahon was Johnny Carson's loyal sidekick and straight-man on 'The Tonight Show', but what many people may not know is that McMahon was also a loyal fan and summer resident of Avalon for nearly two decades. In the late 1960s McMahon built a summer beach house on 18th Street in which he and his family spent many summers, up until the early 80's."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Financial problems===
In June 2008, it was announced that McMahon was $644,000 behind on payments on $4.8 million in mortgage loans and was fighting to avoid foreclosure on his multimillion-dollar [[Beverly Hills]] home.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080604/ap_on_en_tv/people_ed_mcmahon "Ed McMahon fighting foreclosure on his Beverly Hills home however holds deposits in offshore accounts unaccounted for."] AP News; accessed June 4, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; McMahon was also sued by Citibank for $180,000. McMahon appeared on ''[[Larry King Live]]'' on June 5, 2008 with his wife to talk about this situation. In the interview, McMahon's wife Pam said that people assumed that the McMahons had so much money because of his celebrity status. Pamela McMahon also commented that they do not have "millions" of dollars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2008/SHOWBIZ/TV/06/06/lkl.mcmahon/index.html Ed McMahon explains his mortgage mess], CNN.com, June 6, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; On July 30, 2008, McMahon's financial status suffered another blow. According to Reuters, McMahon failed to pay divorce attorney Norman Solovay $275,168, according to a lawsuit filed in the Manhattan federal court. McMahon and his wife, Pamela, had hired Solovay to represent Linda Schmerge, his daughter from another relationship, in a "matrimonial matter," said Solovay's lawyer, Michael Shanker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/televisionNews/idUKN3047452120080731|title=Ed McMahon sued over legal bills|date=July 30, 2008|work=Reuters|first=Edith|last=Honan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 14, 2008, real estate mogul [[Donald Trump]] announced that he would purchase McMahon's home from [[Countrywide Financial]] and lease it to McMahon, so the home would not be foreclosed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/classified/realestate/la-hmw-hotpropmcmahon14-2008aug14,0,6229599.story|title=Donald Trump to buy Ed McMahon’s house|date=August 14, 2008|author=Brenoff, Ann|work=The Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; McMahon agreed instead to a deal with a private buyer for his hilltop home, said Howard Bragman, McMahon's former spokesman. Bragman declined to name the buyer or the selling price, but he said it was not Trump. [[Michael D.

If another buyer should emerge who will create the benefit Mr. Trump sought for Ed McMahon, then he is clearly pleased.}} In early September, after the second buyer's offer fell through, Trump renewed his offer to purchase the home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/26528934|title=Donald Trump 'Still Here To Help' Ed McMahon Stay In House|date=September 3, 2008|author=Wells, Jane}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health problems===
On April 20, 2002, McMahon sued his insurance company for more than $20 million, alleging that he was sickened by [[toxic mold]] that spread through his Beverly Hills house after contractors failed to properly clean up water damage from a broken pipe. McMahon and his wife, Pamela, became ill from the mold, as did members of their household staff, according to the [[Los Angeles County Superior Court]] suit. The McMahons blamed the mold for the death of the family dog, Muffin. Their suit, the [[Mold health issues#Litigation|latest of many in recent years over toxic mold]], was filed against American Equity Insurance Co., a pair of insurance adjusters, and several environmental cleanup contractors. It sought monetary damages for alleged breach of contract, negligence, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.

On March 21, 2003, the long legal battle ended with McMahon being awarded $7.2 million from several companies who were negligent for allowing toxic mold into his home, sickening him and his wife and killing their dog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/may/09/local/me-mold9|title=Ed McMahon Settles Suit Over Mold for $7.2 Million|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=October 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; McMahon was injured in 2007 in a fall and, in March 2008, it was announced he was recovering from a broken neck and two subsequent surgeries. He later sued [[Cedars-Sinai Medical Center]] and two doctors claiming fraud, battery, [[elder abuse]], and emotional distress, and accused them of discharging him with a broken neck after his fall in 2007 and later botching two neck surgeries.

On February 27, 2009 it was reported that McMahon had been in an undisclosed Los Angeles hospital (later confirmed as [[Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center]]) for almost a month. He was listed in serious condition and was in the intensive care unit.
