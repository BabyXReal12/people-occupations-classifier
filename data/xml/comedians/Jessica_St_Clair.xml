She began her comedy career as a regular improviser and sketch performer at the [[Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre]] in New York and Los Angeles, originally as a member of the improv team "Mother". Her first major television work was as a regular panelist on the [[VH1]] series ''[[Best Week Ever]]'', offering comedic insights on pop-culture and the news of the week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bestweekever.tv/tag/Jessica+St.+Clair|title=Latest Celebrity Gossip, Celebrity News, Entertainment News - VH1|website=VH1 News}}&lt;/ref&gt; She co-starred in the short-lived [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] sitcom ''[[In the Motherhood]]'' in 2009.

St. Clair has gained notice for her frequent guest appearances (often alongside performing partner [[Lennon Parham]]) on podcasts such as ''[[Comedy Bang! Bang!]]'', where she plays the show's teenage intern Marissa Wompler. In 2015, St. Clair and Parham spun-off their characters in a new [[Earwolf]] podcast called ''[[Womp It Up!|WOMP It Up!]]'', with St. Clair as host Marissa Wompler and Parham co-hosting as Marissa's teacher Miss Listler. Frequent guests on the podcast include [[Brian Huskey]] as Marissa's stepdad "Seth" and [[Jason Mantzoukas]] as Marissa's former flame Eric "Gutterballs" Gutterman. The podcast ran through the summer of 2015, returning after a hiatus on November 16, 2015.

St. Clair and frequent collaborator [[Lennon Parham]] created and starred in the [[NBC]] comedy series ''[[Best Friends Forever (TV series)|Best Friends Forever]]'', which premiered on April 4, 2012 and aired for one season. St. Clair and Parham created and starred in their second comedy ''[[Playing House (TV series)|Playing House]]'', which premiered on [[USA Network|USA]] on April 29, 2014 and concluded its final, third season in July 2017.

St. Clair has had recurring roles on television programs such as ''[[Veep (TV series)|Veep]]'', ''[[Weeds (TV series)|Weeds]]'', ''[[The McCarthys]]'', ''[[Marry Me (U.S. TV series)|Marry Me]]'', ''[[American Housewife]]'', ''[[Worst Week]]'', and ''[[United States of Tara]]''. She was also part of the recurring cast on the [[Comedy Central]] series ''[[Review (TV series)|Review]]'', playing the role of Suzanne, the long-suffering wife of host Forrest MacNeil (played by [[Andy Daly]]). St. Clair's notable work in film includes supporting roles in ''[[Bridesmaids (2011 film)|Bridesmaids]]'', ''[[She's Out of My League]]'', ''[[Afternoon Delight (film)|Afternoon Delight]]'', and ''[[Enough Said (film)|Enough Said]]''.

==Personal life==
St. Clair is married to playwright and poet [[Dan O'Brien (playwright)|Dan O'Brien]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Weddings: Jessica St. Clair, Dan O’Brien|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/16/fashion/weddings/16stclair.html|accessdate=18 January 2018|work=The New York Times|date=16 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their daughter Isobel Kelly O'Brien was born on October 1, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ossad|first1=Jordana|title=Jessica St. Clair Welcomes Daughter Isobel Kelly|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/469231/jessica-st-clair-welcomes-daughter-isobel-kelly|accessdate=18 January 2018|work=E!

In 2015, St. Clair said she and Lennon Parham had both learned [[Transcendental Meditation technique|Transcendental Meditation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Corridan |first1=Kara |title=A Convo with Two Really Cool Moms |url=http://www.parents.com/parents-magazine/parents-perspective/a-convo-with-two-really-cool-moms/ |website=Parents |accessdate=18 September 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6bddWQKys?url=http://www.parents.com/parents-magazine/parents-perspective/a-convo-with-two-really-cool-moms/ |archivedate=18 September 2015 |date=2015 |quote=Lennon’s husband worked at a school where they taught transcendental meditation and took time out of the school day to meditate. … So Lennon and I learned meditation ... through the David Lynch Foundation, and we try and meditate at least once a day. |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, St. Clair revealed that she had undergone treatment for [[breast cancer]] after being diagnosed in September 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Actress Jessica St. Clair Opens Up About Her Breast Cancer Diagnosis|url=http://www.standup2cancer.org/blog/view/actress_jessica_st_clair_opens_up_about_her_breast_cancer_diagnosis|date=May 9, 2017|work=Stand Up To Cancer|accessdate=May 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this was incorporated into the third season of ''Playing House,'' when her character Emma was similarly diagnosed.
