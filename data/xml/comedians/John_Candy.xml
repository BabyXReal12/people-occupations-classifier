'''John Franklin Candy''' (October 31, 1950 – March 4, 1994)&lt;ref name="googlebooks"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7uKs4fKOotUC&amp;pg=PA29 |title=Guide to the Cinema(s) of Canada |publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]] |last=Rist |first=Peter |year=2001 |page=29 |isbn=978-0-313-29931-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a Canadian comedian and actor known mainly for his work in [[Hollywood]] films. Candy rose to fame as a member of the [[Toronto]] branch of [[the Second City]] and its related ''[[Second City Television]]'' series, and through his appearances in such comedy films as ''[[Stripes (film)|Stripes]]'', ''[[Splash (film)|Splash]]'', ''[[Cool Runnings]]'', ''[[Summer Rental]]'', ''[[Home Alone]]'', ''[[The Great Outdoors (film)|The Great Outdoors]]'', ''[[Spaceballs]]'', and ''[[Uncle Buck]]'', as well as more dramatic roles in ''[[Only the Lonely (film)|Only the Lonely]]'' and ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]''. One of his most renowned onscreen performances was as Del Griffith, the loquacious shower-curtain ring salesman in the [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]] comedy ''[[Planes, Trains and Automobiles]]''.

While filming the Western [[parody]] ''[[Wagons East!]]'', Candy died of a [[heart attack]] in [[Durango, Durango|Durango, Mexico]], on March 4, 1994, aged 43. His final two films, ''Wagons East!'' and ''[[Canadian Bacon]]'', are dedicated to his memory.

== Biography ==

=== Early life and career (1950–1980) ===
Candy was born in 1950 in [[Newmarket, Ontario]].&lt;ref name="googlebooks" /&gt; The son of Sidney James Candy and Evangeline (Aker) Candy, he was brought up in a working-class [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Karen S.|last=Schneider|url=http://people.com/archive/cover-story-exit-laughing-vol-41-no-10/|title=Exit Laughing|publisher=[[People (magazine)|People]]|date=March 21, 1994|accessdate=September 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Candy's father was of [[English Canadians|English]] and [[Scottish Canadians|Scottish]] descent,{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} while his mother was of [[Polish Canadians|Polish]] and [[Ukrainian Canadians|Ukrainian]] descent.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Candy studied at [[Neil McNeil Catholic High School]], later enrolled in the [[Centennial College|Centennial Community College]] to study journalism, and went to [[McMaster University]] for higher education. His first film role was a small, uncredited appearance in the 1973 film ''[[Class of '44]]''. He appeared in several other low-budget films during the 1970s, including the bank-robbery thriller ''[[The Silent Partner (1978 film)|The Silent Partner]]'' with [[Christopher Plummer]] and [[Elliott Gould]]. In 1975, he played Richie, an accused killer, in episode "Web of Guilt", on the [[Television in Canada|Canadian]] TV show ''[[Dr. Simon Locke|Police Surgeon]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvarchive.ca/database/18160/police_surgeon/episode_guide/ Episode Guide – Police Surgeon (Series) (1971–1975)]&lt;br /&gt;January 23, 1975 – "Web of Guilt" Dr Locke intervenes when a woman judge (Nancy Olson) endangers herself by becoming too protective of her brother who is accused of murder. Richie: John Candy. Bonnie: Helen Shaver. Scharfman: Don McGill.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976, Candy played a supporting role (with [[Rick Moranis]]) on [[Peter Gzowski]]'s short-lived, late-night television talk show, ''[[90 Minutes Live]]''. That same year, as a member of Toronto's branch of the Second City,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.secondcity.com/?id=history/alumni/toronto Second City Toronto Alumni] at [http://www.secondcity.com/ Second City] (accessed April 7, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; he gained wide North American popularity, which grew when he became a cast member on the influential Toronto-based comedy-variety show ''Second City Television'' (''SCTV''). [[NBC]] picked the show up in 1981 and it quickly became a fan favourite. It had won [[Emmy Award]]s for the show's writing in 1981 and 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/john-candy-9542625|title=John Candy Biography|publisher=Biography.com|accessdate=January 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1980s career ===
Among Candy's ''[[Second City Television|SCTV]]'' characters were unscrupulous street-beat TV personality Johnny LaRue, 3-D horror [[auteur]] Doctor Tongue, [[sycophant]]ic and easily amused talk-show sidekick William B. Williams, and Melonville's corrupt Mayor Tommy Shanks. Other characters included the cheerful Leutonian clarinetist Yosh Shmenge, who was half of the [[The Shmenge Brothers|Happy Wanderers]] and the subject of the [[mockumentary]] ''[[The Last Polka]]'', folksy fishin' musician Gil Fisher, handsome if accent-challenged TV actor Steve Roman, Pippy Long Socks, hapless children's entertainer Mr. Messenger, corrupt soap-opera doctor William Wainwright, [[Smut (comics)|smut]] merchant Harry, "the Guy With the Snake on His Face", and Giorgy, everyone's favourite Cossack.

Mimicry was one of Candy's talents, which he used often at ''SCTV''. Celebrities impersonated by Candy include [[Jerry Mathers]], [[Divine (performer)|Divine]], [[Orson Welles]], [[Julia Child]], [[Richard Burton]], Silvio Gigante, [[Luciano Pavarotti]], [[Jimmy the Greek]], [[Andrew Sarris]], [[Tip O'Neill]], [[Don Rickles]], [[Curly Howard]], [[Merlin Olsen]], [[Jackie Gleason]], [[Tom Selleck]], [[Gordon Pinsent]], [[Darryl Sittler]], [[Ed Asner]], [[Gertrude Stein]], Morgy Kneele, [[Doug McGrath]], and [[Hervé Villechaize]].

In 1979, Candy took a short [[hiatus (television)|hiatus]] from ''SCTV'' and began a more active film career, appearing in a minor role as a US Army soldier in [[Steven Spielberg]]'s big-budget comedy ''[[1941 (film)|1941]]'' and had a supporting role as parole officer Burton Mercer in ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]''. A year later, Candy played the lovable, mild-mannered Army recruit Dewey Oxberger in 1981's ''Stripes'', one of the most successful films of the year. In 1983, Candy had a cameo appearance in [[Harold Ramis]]'s ''[[National Lampoon's Vacation]]'' and appeared on ''Saturday Night Live'' twice (hosting in 1983) while still appearing on ''SCTV''. According to writer-comedian [[Bob Odenkirk]], Candy was reputedly the "most-burned potential host" of ''SNL'', in that he was asked to host many times, only for plans to be changed by the ''SNL'' staff at the last minute.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Shales &amp; James Andrew Miller, ''Live From New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live'' (Little Brown &amp; Co., 2002), p.345&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, Candy headlined in the film ''[[Going Berserk]]'', and was also approached to play the character of accountant Louis Tully in ''[[Ghostbusters]]'' (completed and released in 1984), but ultimately did not get the role because of his conflicting ideas of how to play the character; the part went instead to Rick Moranis. Candy was one of the many celebrities who appeared chanting "Ghostbusters" in [[Ray Parker, Jr.]]'s hit "[[Ghostbusters (song)|single]]" for the movie. In 1984, Candy played [[Tom Hanks]]'s womanizing brother in the hit romantic comedy '' [[Splash (film)|Splash]]'', generally considered his break-out role.

Throughout the latter half of the 1980s, Candy often took roles in substandard films (performing the voice of a talking horse in the [[Bobcat Goldthwait]] comedy ''[[Hot to Trot]]''). While continuing to play supporting roles in films such as ''[[Spaceballs]]'', Candy headlined or co-starred in such comedy movies as ''[[Volunteers (film)|Volunteers]]'', ''[[Planes, Trains and Automobiles]]'', ''[[Brewster's Millions (1985 film)|Brewster's Millions]]'', ''[[The Great Outdoors (film)|The Great Outdoors]]'', ''[[Armed and Dangerous (1986 film)|Armed and Dangerous]]'', ''[[Who's Harry Crumb?]]'', ''[[Summer Rental]]'', and ''[[Uncle Buck]]''.
He also continued to play bit parts, including a disc jockey in the comic musical film ''[[Little Shop of Horrors (film)|Little Shop of Horrors]]'' and a policeman in the ''[[Sesame Street]]'' film ''[[Sesame Street Presents Follow That Bird|Follow That Bird]]''.

Candy also produced and starred in a Saturday-morning animated series on NBC titled ''[[Camp Candy]]'' in 1989. The show was set in a fictional summer camp run by Candy, featured his two children in supporting roles, and also spawned a brief comic book series published by [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Star Comics]] imprint.

=== Later years and death (1990–1994) ===
In the early 1990s, Candy's career went into decline after he appeared in a string of critical and commercial failures, including ''[[Nothing but Trouble (1991 film)|Nothing but Trouble]]'' (for which he was nominated for a [[Razzie]] as "worst supporting actress", playing a woman), ''[[Delirious (1991 film)|Delirious]]'', and ''[[Once Upon a Crime]]'', although he did appear in major successes such as ''[[Rookie of the Year (film)|Rookie of the Year]]'' (uncredited), ''[[The Rescuers Down Under]]'', ''[[Home Alone]]'', and ''[[Cool Runnings]]''.

Candy attempted to reinvigorate his acting career by broadening his range and playing more dramatic roles. In 1991, Candy appeared in a light romantic drama, ''[[Only the Lonely (film)|Only the Lonely]]'', which had him as a Chicago cop torn between his overbearing mother ([[Maureen O'Hara]]) and his new girlfriend ([[Ally Sheedy]]). The same year and in rare form, Candy played a dramatic role as [[Dean Andrews Jr.]], a shady Southern lawyer in [[Oliver Stone]]'s ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]''. He made his directorial debut in the 1994 comedy ''[[Hostage for a Day]]'', in which he also made a cameo appearance.

In 1991, [[Bruce McNall]], [[Wayne Gretzky]], and Candy became owners of the [[Canadian Football League]]'s [[Toronto Argonauts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Chris|last=Schwarz|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/football/tsn-special-remembers-john-candys-impact-on-the-argos/article4184225/|title=TSN special remembers John Candy's impact on the Argos|newspaper=The Globe and Mail|agency=Reuters|date=November 24, 2011|accessdate=December 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The celebrity ownership group attracted attention in Canada and the team spent a significant amount of money, even signing some highly touted [[National Football League]] prospects such as  wide receiver [[Raghib Ismail]]. The Argonauts took home the [[1991 Grey Cup]], beating Calgary, 36–21, in the final.&lt;ref name="never stopped caring" /&gt;

[[File:John Candy's grave.JPG|thumb|right|Candy's grave at [[Holy Cross Cemetery, Culver City]], California]]
In 1994, while on vacation from film production (''[[Wagons East!]]'') in Durango City, Mexico, Candy called his friends, including Canadian Football League commissioner [[Larry Smith (Canadian politician)|Larry Smith]], and told them that he had just let go of his team and was putting it up for sale. He then called his assistant, who invited Candy to play golf with him in the spring when he returned to Toronto. After cooking a late lasagna dinner for his assistants, Candy called his co-stars from his hotel, then went to sleep. Some time after midnight, on March 4, 1994, Candy was found dead from a presumed [[myocardial infarction]] even though this was unproven, as no autopsy was performed. He was 43 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=No drugs were involved in Candy's death|author=Reuters|newspaper=New Straits Times|date=March 6, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="New York Times"&gt;{{cite news|last=Collins|first=Glenn|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/20/obituaries/john-candy-comedic-film-star-is-dead-of-a-heart-attack-at-44.html|title=John Candy, Comedic Film Star, Is Dead of a heart attack at 44|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 20, 1994|accessdate=January 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The heavyset Candy had struggled for some years with weight-related health issues.&lt;ref name="New York Times" /&gt;

Candy and his wife, Rosemary Hobor, had two children.

=== Unfinished projects ===
Candy was in talks to portray Ignatius J. Reilly in a now-shelved film adaptation of [[John Kennedy Toole]]'s [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning novel ''[[A Confederacy of Dunces]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fretts|first=Bruce|title=''A Confederacy of Dunces'' celebrates its 20th anniversary|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2000/05/19/confederacy-dunces-celebrates-its-20th-anniversary|date=May 19, 2000|accessdate=July 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hyman|first=Peter|title=A Conspiracy of Dunces: Will John Kennedy Toole's comic masterpiece ever reach the big screen?|date=December 14, 2006|publisher=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/hollywood/2006/12/a_conspiracy_of_dunces.html|accessdate=July 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Evans|first=Bradford|title=10 Actors Who Came Close to Starring in 'A Confederacy of Dunces'|publisher=[[Splitsider]]|url=http://splitsider.com/2013/03/8-actors-who-came-close-to-starring-in-a-confederacy-of-dunces/|date=March 28, 2013|accessdate=July 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had also expressed interest in portraying [[Atuk]] in a film adaptation of [[Mordecai Richler]]'s ''[[The Incomparable Atuk]]'' and [[Roscoe Arbuckle|Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle]] in a biopic based on the [[silent film]] comedian's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Raouf|first=Neda|title=The 'Atuk' Curse|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/feb/21/magazine/tm-10276|date=February 21, 1999||accessdate=August 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bovsun|first=Mara|title=Roscoe 'Fatty' Arbuckle, acquitted for murder of Virginia Rappe in 1922, never recovered from all the bad press|newspaper=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/justice-story/roscoe-fatty-arbuckle-acquitted-murder-virginia-rappe-1922-recovered-bad-press-article-1.1149824|date=September 1, 2012|accessdate=August 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These three shelved projects have been referred to as "cursed" because Candy, [[John Belushi]], [[Sam Kinison]] and [[Chris Farley]] were each attached to all three roles, and they all died before they could make any of these films.&lt;ref name=split /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Evans|first=Bradford|title=The Lost Roles of John Belushi|publisher=[[Splitsider]]|url=http://splitsider.com/2011/03/the-lost-roles-of-john-belushi/|date=March 3, 2011|accessdate=August 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Candy was also slated to collaborate with John Hughes in a comedy film opposite [[Sylvester Stallone]] titled ''Bartholomew vs. Neff''. This project, also shelved, was about two feuding neighbours who were to have been portrayed by Candy and Stallone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Carter|first=Bill|title=Him Alone|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/04/magazine/him-alone.html?src=pm&amp;pagewanted=2|date=August 4, 1991|accessdate=July 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=SHORT TAKES : Stallone in Line for Comedy Role|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-07-30/entertainment/ca-997_1_sylvester-stallone|date=July 30, 1990|accessdate=July 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Candy was originally considered to play [[Alec Guinness]]'s role in the [[Last Holiday (2006 film)|remake]] of the 1950 film, ''[[Last Holiday (1950 film)|Last Holiday]]'', with [[Carl Reiner]] directing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Siskel|first=Gene|title=Sour Movies Keep Candy Just Short Of Sweet Success|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1986-03-30/entertainment/8601230533_1_sctv-film-summer-rental/3|date=March 30, 1986|accessdate=July 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually the role was played by [[Queen Latifah]] in a [[Last Holiday (2006 film)|loose remake]] released in 2006.&lt;ref name=split&gt;{{cite web|last=Evans|first=Bradford|title=The Lost Roles of John Candy|publisher=[[Splitsider]]|url=http://splitsider.com/2011/06/the-lost-roles-of-john-candy/|date=June 2, 2011|accessdate=July 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Candy also had the comic relief role of the turkey Red Feather in the animated Disney film ''[[Pocahontas (1995 film)|Pocahontas]]'' written for him. The role was subsequently cut from the film after his death.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

== Legacy ==
Candy's funeral was held at [[St. Martin of Tours Catholic Church]] in Los Angeles. Candy was entombed in the mausoleum at [[Holy Cross Cemetery, Culver City|Holy Cross Cemetery]] in Culver City, California. His crypt lies just above fellow actor [[Fred MacMurray]]. On March 18, 1994, a special memorial service for Candy, produced by his former improvization troupe, the Second City, was broadcast across Canada.&lt;ref name="chtv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/chtv/hamilton/info/history.html|title=CH Hamilton|publisher=CanWest MediaWorks Publications Inc.|accessdate=January 29, 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060129104620/http://www.canada.com/chtv/hamilton/info/history.html|archivedate=January 29, 2006|df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:John Candy Star on Canada's Walk of Fame.jpg|thumb|left|Candy's star on Canada's Walk of Fame|193x193px]]

''Wagons East!'' was completed using a stunt double and special effects and released five months after Candy's death. His final completed film was ''Canadian Bacon'', a satirical comedy by [[Michael Moore]] that was released a year after Candy's death. Candy played American sheriff Bud Boomer, who led an "invasion" of Canada. Candy recorded a voice for the TV film ''[[The Magic 7]]'' in the early 1990s. The film remained in production for years due to animation difficulties and production delays, and it was shelved. Candy was inducted into [[Canada's Walk of Fame]]. In May 2006, Candy became one of the first four entertainers ever honoured by [[Canada Post]] by being featured on a postage stamp. ''[[Blues Brothers 2000]]'' is dedicated to three people, including Candy, who played a supporting role in the original ''Blues Brothers''. A tribute to Candy was hosted by [[Dan Aykroyd]] at the [[2007 Grey Cup]] festivities in Toronto in November 2007.&lt;ref name="never stopped caring"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://v1.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20071121.wsptbrunt21/BNStory/STEPHEN+BRUNT/|title=Candy never stopped caring|last=Brunt|first=Stephen|date=November 21, 2007|newspaper=Globe and Mail|accessdate=October 5, 2009|location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ween]]'s ''[[Chocolate and Cheese]]'' album, released in 1994, is "dedicated in loving memory to John Candy (1950–1994)". At the time Gene Ween remarked, "there was so much going on about Kurt Cobain, and nobody mentioned John Candy at all. I have a special little spot in my heart for him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/ween-19950406|title=Q&amp;A: Ween|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The John Candy Visual Arts Studio at [[Neil McNeil Catholic High School]], in Toronto, Ontario, was dedicated in his honour after his death. Candy, one of the school's most famous alumni, said during one of his annual visits to the school, "My success is simply rooted in the values and discipline and respect for others that I was taught at Neil McNeil." Candy's daughter, Jennifer Candy, is an actress and television producer, having production credits for the television series ''[[Prom Queen]]'' and ''[[Sam Has 7 Friends]]''.

Support has been growing for giving the [[Canadian Screen Awards]] the official nickname "The Candys," both in honour of the actor and because the name suggests Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Howell|first=Peter|title=Chair of Canadian film/TV academy is sweet on calling awards 'the Candys'|url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/movies/2016/03/14/chair-of-canadian-filmtv-academy-is-sweet-on-calling-awards-the-candys.html|newspaper=Toronto Star|date=March 15, 2016|accessdate=March 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
