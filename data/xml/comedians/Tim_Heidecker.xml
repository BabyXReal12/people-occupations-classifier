'''Timothy Richard Heidecker''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|aɪ|d|ɛ|k|ər}}; born February 3, 1976) is an American comedian, writer, director, actor, and musician. He is best known as one half of the comedy duo [[Tim &amp; Eric]], along with [[Eric Wareheim]]. They are noted for creating the television shows ''[[Tom Goes to the Mayor]]'', ''[[Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!]]'', and ''[[Tim &amp; Eric's Bedtime Stories]]''.

Heidecker has also acted in several films, including ''[[Ant-Man and the Wasp]]'' (2018), ''[[Bridesmaids (2011 film)|Bridesmaids]]'' (2011), ''[[Tim and Eric's Billion Dollar Movie]]'',  and ''[[The Comedy]]'' (both 2012); he received critical acclaim for the latter. He currently co-hosts the parodic film review web series ''[[On Cinema]]'' and stars in the comedy series ''[[Decker (TV series)|Decker]]'', both alongside [[Gregg Turkington]].

==Early life==
Heidecker was born and raised in [[Allentown, Pennsylvania]]. He attended [[Allentown Central Catholic High School]] and [[Temple University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.myspace.com/heidecker | title = Bio from Tim Heidecker’s Myspace page | accessdate = 2007-02-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Heidecker and Wareheim first became known as the creators, writers, and stars of ''[[Tom Goes to the Mayor]]'', a [[limited animation]] series that originally aired from November 2004 to September 2006 on the [[Adult Swim]] channel.  Tim plays "Tom," the protagonist of the show. He continually brings his ideas to the Mayor (played by Wareheim), who ends up thwarting them in most cases and leaving Tom worse off than when he started. According to their website  Wareheim and Heidecker had mailed copies of an early version of the show to comedian [[Bob Odenkirk]], who agreed to take on the project as the executive producer of the series and sold it to Adult Swim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117946848.html?categoryid=2242&amp;cs=1 | title = 10 Comics to Watch: Tim Heidecker and Eric Wareheim | first = Janelle | last = Brown | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = 2006-07-17 | accessdate = 2007-02-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The duo's next show, ''[[Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!]]'', premiered on February 11, 2007 on [[Adult Swim]]. The eleven-minute show features "live action, sketch, animation, emotions, phone calls, love, etc."

Heidecker starred in ''[[Tim and Eric's Billion Dollar Movie]]''. Wareheim and Heidecker appeared together as [[Collection agency|Debt Collectors]] on the [[Adult Swim]] special, ''[[Young Person's Guide to History|The Young Persons Guide to History]]'' and have made guest appearances in the movie ''[[Let's Go to Prison]]'', as well as the Scottish video game series ''[[VideoGaiden]]'' and a Version 2 episode of ''[[Mega64]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0793166/ | title = "Mega64": Stranger| work = IMDb | accessdate = 2009-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heidecker also had a small role in the 2011 film ''[[Bridesmaids (2011 film)|Bridesmaids]]'', and a leading role in the 2012 independent drama ''[[The Comedy (film)|The Comedy]]'', directed by [[Rick Alverson]] and also starring Wareheim.

Heidecker appeared in an episode of the ''[[RedLetterMedia]]'' series, "Half in The Bag." The episode is titled, "Season Finale: Step Up Revolution." Within the short sketch comedy, Heidecker plays a VCR repair man named "Tim". Shortly after his introduction into the scene, he flies through the ceiling and makes his exit from the skit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://redlettermedia.com/half-in-the-bag-step-up-revolution |title=Red Letter Media Half in the Bag: Step Up Revolution : |publisher=Redlettermedia.com |date=2012-08-07 |accessdate=2015-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heidecker starred in a series of films for [[Absolut Vodka|Absolut Vodka's]] website with Wareheim and [[Zach Galifianakis]].  In March 2010, Heidecker and Wareheim directed a series of [[Old Spice]] commercials starring actor [[Terry Crews]]. Using characters and skits from Awesome Show, Heidecker and Wareheim (via their [[Abso Lutely Productions]] company) created an online-only show called "[[Tim and Eric Nite Live!]]," originally broadcast on the website [[SuperDeluxe]].

Since 2012 Heidecker has been hosting a parodic [[web series]] and [[podcast]] called ''[[On Cinema]]'', where he and special guest ([[Gregg Turkington]]) discuss films from past and present. In 2013 an ''On Cinema Film Guide'' app was released, featuring the voices of Heidecker and Turkington reviewing over 17,000 films.

Heidecker, Wareheim, [[Sarah Silverman]], [[Michael Cera]], and [[Reggie Watts]] announced on the podcast ''[[Comedy Bang! Bang!]]'' that they were starting a comedy YouTube channel called [[Jash]].

The duo's most recent show, ''[[Tim and Eric's Bedtime Stories]]'' premiered on Adult Swim on September 18, 2014.

==Music==
Heidecker played in various [[indie rock]] bands while in Philadelphia. He made an appearance in the 2008 [[Ben Folds]] and [[Regina Spektor]] music video entitled "[[You Don't Know Me (Ben Folds song)|You Don't Know Me]]".

Although Davin Wood composed the music for ''Awesome Show'', Heidecker would sometimes sing and write lyrics. [[Williams Street Records]] released both ''Awesome Record, Great Songs!'' and ''Uncle Muscles Presents Casey And His Brother'' in 2008, featuring music from the first two seasons. Wood previously composed the music for ''Tom Goes To The Mayor'', and he and Heidecker form the duo Heidecker &amp; Wood. Inspired by 1970s soft rock, they released their first album, ''Starting From Nowhere'', on March 15, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Hudson, Alex.

The day after the release of [[Bob Dylan]]'s album ''[[Tempest (Bob Dylan album)|Tempest]]'' in September 2012, Heidecker released a song called "Titanic", which is a 15-minute-long spoof of the track on the album. In 2013, he released two more Dylan parodies—"Running Out the Clock", inspired by Dylan's 1983 album ''[[Infidels (Bob Dylan album)|Infidels]]'', and "Long Black Dress", a song in the actual style of Dylan's album ''Tempest''—and collaborated with the indie band The Earth is a Man on a cover of Dylan's "[[All the Tired Horses]]."

In December 2013, Heidecker released the album ''Urinal St. Station'' under the Drag City label with his band, The Yellow River Boys.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dragcity.com/products/urinal-st-station Urinal St. Station, by the Yellow River Boys].
