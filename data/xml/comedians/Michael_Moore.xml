Michael Francis Moore was born in [[Flint, Michigan]], and raised in [[Davison, Michigan|Davison]] by parents Helen Veronica (née Wall),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/CSPAN2_20111002_160000_Book_TV|title=Book TV : CSPAN2 : October 2, 2011 12:00pm-3:00pm EDT : Free Streaming|publisher=|via=archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; a secretary, and Francis Richard "Frank" Moore, an automotive assembly-line worker.&lt;ref name="nytimesbio"&gt;{{cite news|title=Michael Moore.

==Career==
Moore dropped out of the [[University of Michigan-Flint]] following his first year (where he wrote for the student newspaper ''[[The Michigan Times]]''). At 22 he founded the alternative weekly magazine ''The Flint Voice'', which soon changed its name to ''The Michigan Voice'' as it expanded to cover the entire state. Popstar [[Harry Chapin]] is credited with being the reason the magazine was able to start by performing benefit concerts and donating the money to Moore. Moore crept backstage after a concert to Harry's dressing room and convinced him to do a concert and give the money to him. Harry ended up doing a concert in Flint every year, selling out to the entire town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icVAfCMpets | title = Michael Moore on how Harry Chapin helped found the magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
In 1986, when Moore became the editor of [[Mother Jones (magazine)|''Mother Jones'']], a liberal political magazine, ''The Michigan Voice'' was shut down by the investors and he moved to California.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}
[[File:Michael Moore 66ème Festival de Venise (Mostra) color.jpg|thumb|Moore at the [[66th Venice International Film Festival]] in September 2009]]
After four months at ''Mother Jones'', Moore was fired. [[Matt Labash]] of ''[[The Weekly Standard]]'' reported this was for refusing to print an article by [[Paul Berman]] that was critical of the [[Sandinista National Liberation Front|Sandinista]] human rights record in Nicaragua.&lt;ref name="Schultz"&gt;{{cite book|last=Schultz|first=Emily|title=Michael Moore: a biorgraphy|year=2005|publisher=ECW Press|location=47–54|isbn=1-55022-699-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moore refused to run the article, believing it to be inaccurate. "The article was flatly wrong and the worst kind of patronizing bullshit. You would scarcely know from it that the United States had been at war with Nicaragua for the last five years."&lt;ref&gt;Cockburn, Alexander. "Beat The Devil: Michael meets Mr. Jones", ''[[The Nation]]'', September 13, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moore believes that ''Mother Jones'' fired him because of the publisher's refusal to allow him to cover a story on the GM plant closings in his hometown of [[Flint, Michigan]]. He responded by putting laid-off GM worker [[Ben Hamper]] (who was also writing for the same magazine at the time) on the magazine's cover, leading to his termination. Moore sued for wrongful dismissal, and settled out of court for $58,000, providing him with seed money for his first film, ''[[Roger &amp; Me]].''&lt;ref&gt;Matt Labash.

===Directing/producing/screenwriting===
; ''[[Roger &amp; Me]]'': The 1989 film was Moore's first documentary about what happened to [[Flint, Michigan]], after [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] closed its factories and opened new ones in Mexico, where the workers were paid much less. Since then Moore has become known as a critic of the [[neoliberalism|neoliberal]] view of [[globalization]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} "Roger" is [[Roger Smith (executive)|Roger B. Smith]], former CEO and President of General Motors. [[Harlan Jacobson]], editor of ''[[Film Comment]]'' magazine, said that Moore muddled the chronology in ''Roger &amp; Me'' to make it seem that events that took place before G.M.'s layoffs were a consequence of them.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} Critic [[Roger Ebert]] defended Moore's handling of the timeline as an artistic and stylistic choice that had less to do with his credibility as a filmmaker and more to do with the flexibility of film as a medium to express a satiric viewpoint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Attacks on 'Roger &amp; Me' completely miss the point of the film |first=Roger|last=Ebert|date =February 11, 1990|publisher=Sun Times|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19900211/COMMENTARY/22010306|accessdate =October 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; ''[[Pets or Meat: The Return to Flint]]'': Moore made a follow-up 23-minute documentary film that aired on PBS in 1992. It is based on ''Roger &amp; Me''. The film's title refers to Rhonda Britton, a Flint, Michigan, resident featured in both the 1989 and 1992 films who sells rabbits as either pets or meat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Roger and Me' Revisited |author=Diane Katz |publisher=[[The Detroit News]] |date=September 20, 1992 |accessdate=March 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; ''[[Canadian Bacon]]''
: Moore's 1995 satirical film features a fictional U.S. president (played by [[Alan Alda]]) engineering a fake war with Canada in order to boost his popularity. It is noted for containing a number of Canadian and American stereotypes, and for being Moore's only non-documentary film. The film is also one of the last featuring Canadian-born actor [[John Candy]], and also features a number of cameos by other Canadian actors. In the film, several potential enemies for America's next great campaign are discussed by the president and his cabinet. (The scene was strongly influenced by the [[Stanley Kubrick]] film ''[[Dr. Strangelove]].''{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}) The president comments that declaring war on Canada was as ridiculous as declaring war on international terrorism. His military advisor (played by [[Rip Torn]]) quickly rejects this idea, saying that no one would care about "a bunch of guys driving around blowing up rent-a-cars."{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

; ''[[The Big One (film)|The Big One]]'': This 1997 film documents the tour publicizing Moore's book ''[[Downsize This!|Downsize This! Random Threats from an Unarmed American]]'', in which he criticizes mass layoffs despite record corporate profits. Among others, he targets [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] for outsourcing shoe production to [[Indonesia]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

''Fahrenheit'' was awarded the ''[[Palme d'Or]]'',&lt;ref name="cannes-2004.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/4201423/year/2004.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Fahrenheit 9/11 |accessdate=November 30, 2009 |work=festival-cannes.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118184523/http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/4201423/year/2004.html |archivedate=January 18, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the top honor at the [[2004 Cannes Film Festival]]; it was the first documentary film to win the prize since 1956. Moore later announced that ''Fahrenheit 9/11'' would not be in consideration for the 2005 [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature|Academy Award for Documentary Feature]], but instead for the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]]. He stated he wanted the movie to be seen by a few million more people via television broadcast prior to Election Day. According to Moore, "Academy rules forbid the airing of a documentary on television within nine months of its theatrical release", and since the November 2 election was fewer than nine months after the film's release, it would have been disqualified for the Documentary Oscar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.michaelmoore.com/words/mikes-letter/why-i-will-not-seek-a-best-documentary-oscar-im-giving-it-up-in-the-hopes-more-voters-can-see-fahrenheit-911 |title=Why I Will Not Seek a Best Documentary Oscar (I'm giving it up in the hopes more voters can see "Fahrenheit 9/11") |author=Michael Moore |date=September 6, 2004 |accessdate=March 8, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514042536/http://www.michaelmoore.com/words/mikes-letter/why-i-will-not-seek-a-best-documentary-oscar-im-giving-it-up-in-the-hopes-more-voters-can-see-fahrenheit-911 |archivedate=May 14, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless, ''Fahrenheit'' did not receive an Oscar nomination for Best Picture.

On ''[[Real Time with Bill Maher]]'', Moore and [[Bill Maher]] knelt before Nader to plead with him to stay out of the race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A33257-2004Aug1.html |title=Bill Maher: Back for More |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date=August 2, 2004 |accessdate=March 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moore drew attention in 2004 when he used the term "deserter" to describe then president [[George W. Bush]] while introducing Retired Army Gen. [[Wesley K. Clark]] at a Democratic Presidential debate in New Hampshire. Noting that Clark had been a champion debater at West Point, Moore told a laughing crowd, "I know what you're thinking. I want to see that debate" between Clark and Bush – "the general versus the deserter". Moore said he was referring to published reports in several media outlets including ''The Boston Globe'' which had reported that "there is strong evidence that Bush performed no military service as required when he moved from Houston to Alabama to work on a U.S. Senate campaign from May to November 1972."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.michaelmoore.com/words/mikes-letter/george-w-bush-awol#article2 |title=George W.

In an op-ed piece for ''[[The New York Times]]'' published on December 31, 2013, Moore assessed the [[Affordable Care Act]], calling it "awful" and adding that, "Obamacare's rocky start ... is a result of one fatal flaw: The Affordable Care Act is a pro-insurance-industry plan implemented by a president who knew in his heart that a single-payer, Medicare-for-all model was the true way to go." Despite his strong critique, however, Moore wrote that he still considers the plan a "godsend" because it provides a start "to get what we deserve: universal quality health care."&lt;ref name="NYT-20131231"&gt;{{cite news |last=Moore |first=Michael |title=The Obamacare We Deserve |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/01/opinion/moore-the-obamacare-we-deserve.html |date=December 31, 2013 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=January 6, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TNR-20140105"&gt;{{cite news|author=Noam Schieber|title=How Obamacare Actually Paves the Way Toward Single Payer|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/116105/obamacare-will-lead-single-payer-michael-moore|date=January 5, 2014 |work=[[The New Republic]]|accessdate=January 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
