Kemper gained some [[List of Internet phenomena|Internet fame]] in August 2007 for her part in "Blowjob Girl", a humor video on the sketch comedy site [[Derrick Comedy]].

Kemper auditioned for a role in ''[[Parks and Recreation]]'', an [[NBC]] comedy series started in 2009 by [[Michael Schur]] and [[Greg Daniels]], creator of the series ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]''. She was not cast in the role, but received a call back to audition for a supporting role in ''The Office'' as [[Erin Hannon]], a secretary filling in for the regular secretary [[Pam Beesly]] when she briefly left the job at the end of the [[The Office (US TV series) season 5|fifth season]]. Kemper was cast in the role, and started appearing in the show in April 2009. The character was originally written to be more sarcastic and dry, but the writers changed her to be more perky and optimistic to more closely resemble Kemper herself. Kemper described the character as "an exaggerated version of myself".&lt;ref name="SLPD1213" /&gt; Kemper described herself as a "huge fan" of the show and was thrilled to be on it.&lt;ref name="Princeton" /&gt; Although the character was originally intended for four episodes, the producers were impressed with Kemper and signed her as a regular in the [[The Office (US TV series) season 6|sixth season]].&lt;ref name="SLPD1213" /&gt; [[Jennifer Celotta]], a screenwriter with the series, described Kemper as a "fun addition" to the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title="Company Picnic" Q&amp;A with Jen Celotta |work=OfficeTally |url=http://www.officetally.com/company-picnic-qa-with-jen-celotta |date=May 22, 2009 |accessdate=May 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
