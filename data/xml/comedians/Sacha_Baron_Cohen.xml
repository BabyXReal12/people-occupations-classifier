'''Sacha Noam Baron Cohen'''&lt;ref name=birthname&gt;{{cite web |title=Baron Cohen, Sacha |publisher=[[BFI Film &amp; TV Database]] |url=http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/individual/837355 |accessdate=6 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; (born 13 October 1971) is a British actor, comedian, screenwriter, and producer. Baron Cohen has created and portrayed fictional characters [[Ali G]], [[Borat Sagdiyev]], [[Brüno Gehard]], and [[The Dictator (2012 film)|Admiral General Aladeen]]. Like his idol [[Peter Sellers]], he adopts a variety of accents and guises for his characters and rarely appears out of character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sacha Baron Cohen is the Peter Sellers of our age|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/film/grimsby/sacha-baron-cohen-peter-sellers-characters/|publisher=The Telegraph|date=30 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most of his routines, Baron Cohen's characters interact with unsuspecting people, documentary style, who do not realise they are being set up for comic situations and self-revealing ridicule. His other work includes voicing [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#King Julien XIII|King Julien XIII]] in the ''[[Madagascar (franchise)|Madagascar]]'' film series (2005–2012) and appearing in ''[[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007 film)|Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street]]'' (2007), ''[[Hugo (film)|Hugo]]'' (2011) and ''[[Les Misérables (2012 film)|Les Misérables]]'' (2012). He made a cameo as a [[BBC News]] Anchor in ''[[Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues]]'' (2013). In 2016, he played an English [[Football hooliganism in the United Kingdom|football hooligan]] brother of an [[MI6]] spy in the comedy film ''[[Grimsby (film)|Grimsby]]'', and co-starred as Time in the fantasy sequel ''[[Alice Through the Looking Glass (2016 film)|Alice Through the Looking Glass]]''. In 2018, Baron Cohen created and starred in ''[[Who Is America?]]'' for [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]], his first television project since ''Da Ali G Show''.

Baron Cohen was named Best Newcomer at the 1999 [[British Comedy Awards]] for ''[[The 11&amp;nbsp;O'Clock Show]]'', and since then, he has received two [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] Awards for ''[[Da Ali G Show]]'', several [[Emmy]] nominations, a nomination for an [[Academy Award for Writing Adapted Screenplay]], and a [[Golden Globe]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Best Actor]] for his work in the feature film ''[[Borat]]''. After the release of ''Borat'', Baron Cohen stated that because the public had become too familiar with the characters, he would retire Borat and Ali G.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.actressarchives.com/news/baron-cohen-borat-and-ali-g-are-dead-to-me|title=Borat and Ali G are dead for Sacha Baron Cohen|work=actressarchives.com|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=21 December 2007|accessdate=15 July 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104072349/http://www.actressarchives.com/news/baron-cohen-borat-and-ali-g-are-dead-to-me|archivedate=4 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, after the release of ''[[Brüno]]'', Baron Cohen stated he would also retire the title character.&lt;ref name="shed"&gt;[http://digitaljournal.com/article/247826 Entertainment Sacha Baron Cohen to shed Borat persona for good] digitaljournal.com, 15 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; At the 2012 British Comedy Awards, he received the Outstanding Achievement Award, accepting the award while reprising his Ali G character.&lt;ref name="lifetime award"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-20696034|title=Sacha Baron Cohen honoured at British Comedy Awards|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, he received the BAFTA Charlie Chaplin [[Britannia Awards|Britannia Award]] for Excellence in Comedy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24030122 "Sacha Baron Cohen to get Bafta LA comedy award"].

The Observer. Retrieved 10 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt;}}
After leaving university, Baron Cohen worked for a time as a [[fashion model]].&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"/&gt; By the early 1990s, he was hosting a weekly programme on Windsor cable television's local broadcasts with [[Carol Kirkwood]], who later became a [[BBC]] weather forecaster. In 1995, [[Channel 4]] was planning a replacement for its series ''[[The Word (TV series)|The Word]]'', and disseminated an open call for new television presenters. Baron Cohen sent in a tape of himself in the character of Kristo, an [[Albanians|Albanian]] fictional television reporter (who developed into the [[Kazakhstan|Kazakh]] [[Borat Sagdiyev]]), which caught the attention of a producer. Baron Cohen hosted ''Pump TV'' from 1995 to 1996. [[Peter Sellers]], known for portraying a wide range of comic characters using different accents and guises, was referred to by Baron Cohen as "the most seminal force in shaping [his] early ideas on comedy".&lt;ref&gt;Saunders, Robert A. (2009). ''The Many Faces of Sacha Baron Cohen: Politics, Parody, and the Battle Over Borat''. p. 22. Lanham, Maryland: Rowman &amp; Littlefield.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, he began presenting the youth chat programme ''[[F2F (TV series)|F2F]]'' for [[Granada Talk TV]] and also had a small role in an advert for McCain Microchips playing the role of a chef in a commercial entitled "Ping Pong".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTwtvzqPgmY|title=McCain's Micro Chips Ping Pong TV Ad Commercial|date=20 May 2012|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; He took clown training in Paris, at the [[Philippe Gaulier#.C3.89cole Philippe Gaulier|Ecole Philippe Gaulier]], studying under master-clown [[Philippe Gaulier]].

''The Daily Telegraph''&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1990s, Baron Cohen made his first feature film appearance in the British comedy ''[[The Jolly Boys' Last Stand]]''. In 2000, Baron Cohen played the part of [[Super Greg]] for a series of TV advertisements for [[Lee Jeans]]; the advertisements never aired but the website for Super Greg created an internet sensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last=Lauerman | first=Kerry | title=It's Borat Day! | work=Salon | date=3 November 2006 | series=Video Dog | url=http://archive.salon.com/ent/video_dog/comedy/2006/11/03/supergreg/index.html | accessdate=12 August 2009 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090707020754/http://archive.salon.com/ent/video_dog/comedy/2006/11/03/supergreg/index.html | archivedate=7 July 2009 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

I ain't living in my nan's house anymore. I is living in her garage".&lt;ref name="lifetime award"/&gt;

Ali G's interviews with celebrities (often politicians) gained notoriety partly because the subjects were not privy to the joke that Ali G, rather than being a real interviewer, was a comic character played by Baron Cohen. According to ''Rolling Stone'' magazine, Baron Cohen would always enter the interview area in character as Ali G, carrying equipment and appearing to be an inconspicuous crew member. He would arrive with a suited man, whom the interviewee naturally thought was the interviewer. Baron Cohen, as Ali G, would sit down to begin conducting the interview by asking the interviewee some preliminary questions. The interviewee, however, would remain under the impression that the smartly-dressed director would be conducting the interview until short notice prior to cameras rolling: this would grant an advantage of surprise, whereby the interviewee would be less likely to opt out of the Ali interview prior to its start.&lt;ref name=manbehindmustache&gt;{{cite news|last =Strauss|first =Neil|author2 =|title =The man behind the mustache|pages =|work =Rolling Stone|date =14 November 2006|url =https://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/sacha_baron_cohen_the_real_borat_finally_speaks|accessdate =14 August 2008|deadurl =yes|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070102223451/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/sacha_baron_cohen_the_real_borat_finally_speaks|archivedate =2 January 2007|df =dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Borat.portrait.png|thumb|right|upright|Baron Cohen as Borat, 2006]]

''[[Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan]]'', a feature film with [[Borat Sagdiyev|Borat]] at the centre, was screened at the [[2006 Toronto International Film Festival]] and released in the United Kingdom on 2 November 2006, in the United States on 3 November 2006 and Australia 23 November 2006. The film is about a journey across the US in an ice cream truck, in which the main character is obsessed with the idea of marrying [[Pamela Anderson]]. The film is a [[mockumentary]] which includes interviews with various Americans that poke fun at [[American culture]], as well as [[sexism]], [[racism in the United States|racism]], [[homophobia]], [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitism]], and [[jingoism]]. It debuted at the No. 1 spot in the US, taking in an estimated $26.4&amp;nbsp;million in just 837 theatres averaging $31,600 per theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Borat' takes U.S. by storm Finishes No. 1 with $26.4 mil on just 837 screens|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/borat-takes-us-by-storm-142051|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=9 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baron Cohen won the 2007 [[Golden Globe]] in the "[[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Best Actor – Musical or Comedy]]" category, his sixth such award. Although Borat was up for "Best Motion Picture&amp;nbsp;– Musical or Comedy", the film lost to ''[[Dreamgirls (film)|Dreamgirls]]''. On 23 January 2007, he was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay]]. He shared his nomination with the film's co-writers, Ant Hines, [[Peter Baynham]], [[Dan Mazer]], and [[Todd Phillips]].

Aside from the comic elements of his characters, Baron Cohen's performances are interpreted by some as reflecting uncomfortable truths about his audience. He juxtaposes his own Jewish heritage with the anti-Semitism of his character Borat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.borat.tv/video/Throw_the_Jew_Down_the_Well.mov|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060327094957/http://www.borat.tv/video/Throw_the_Jew_Down_the_Well.mov|dead-url=yes|archive-date=27 March 2006|title=Borat|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Baron Cohen published a travel guide as Borat, with dual titles: ''Borat: Touristic Guidings To Minor Nation of U.S. and A.'' and ''Borat: Touristic Guidings To Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan''.&lt;ref name="Book"&gt;{{cite book|title=Borat: touristic guidings to glorious nation of Kazakhstan : touristic guidings to minor nation of U.

===Brüno Gehard===
{{Main|Brüno Gehard}}
Another alter ego Sacha Baron Cohen performed as is '[[Brüno (character)|Brüno]]', a flamboyantly gay, Austrian fashion show presenter who often lures his unwitting subjects into making provocative statements and engaging in embarrassing behaviour, as well as leading them to contradict themselves, often in the same interview. Brüno asks the subjects to answer "yes or no" questions with either "Vassup" (what's up) or "Ich don't think so" (No); these are occasionally substituted with "Ach, ja!" (Ah yes!) or "Nicht, nicht" ("Nicht" means "not" in German). In one segment on ''Da Ali&amp;nbsp;G Show'', he encouraged his guest to answer questions with either "Keep them in the ghetto" or "Train to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]]".

Brüno's main comedic satire pertains to the vacuity and inanity of the fashion and [[Clubbing (subculture)|clubbing]] world. In May 2009, at the [[2009 MTV Movie Awards|MTV Movie Awards]], Baron Cohen appeared as Brüno wearing a white angel costume, a white [[jockstrap]], white [[go-go boot]]s, and white wings; and did an aerial stunt where he dropped from a height (using wires) onto [[Eminem]]. Baron Cohen landed with his face on Eminem's crotch, with his crotch in Eminem's face, prompting Eminem to exit the venue with fellow rappers [[D12]]. Eminem later admitted to staging the stunt with Baron Cohen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/31053788 |title=Eminem-Bruno Stunt on MTV Was Planned |publisher=MSNBC |date=6 February 2009 |accessdate=18 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After an intense bidding war that included such Hollywood powerhouses as [[DreamWorks]], [[Sony Pictures Entertainment|Sony]], and [[20th Century Fox]], [[Universal Pictures]] won and paid a reported $42.5&amp;nbsp;million for the [[film rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Forbes | url=https://www.forbes.com/home/digitalentertainment/2006/11/13/borat-cohen-money-tech-media-cz_lg_1114borat.html | title=Borat is Rich...NOT | date= 13 November 2006 | accessdate=21 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of [[shill]] companies and websites were created in order to draw potential interviewees into interviews by creating an illusion of legitimacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/years/2009/0319092bruno1.html | title=Sacha Baron Cohen's Guerilla Tactics | date=19 March 2009 | accessdate=20 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brüno|The film]] was released in July 2009.

===Admiral General Aladeen===
{{Main|The Dictator (2012 film)}}

Baron Cohen's 2012 film, ''[[The Dictator (2012 film)|The Dictator]]'', was described by its press as "the heroic story of a dictator who risked his life to ensure that democracy would never come to the country he so lovingly oppressed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-12240086 |publisher=BBC News | title=Sacha Baron Cohen to make film of 'Saddam Hussein book{{'-}} | date=20 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baron Cohen played Admiral General Aladeen, a dictator from a fictional country called the Republic of Wadiya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/News/story.asp?nid=31198 |title=First Official Shot From The Dictator |publisher=Empireonline.com |date= |accessdate=17 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="officialsite"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.republicofwadiya.com/ |title=The Dictator Trailer &amp; Official Movie Site |publisher=Paramount Pictures |accessdate=6 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Borat'' and ''Brüno'' film director [[Larry Charles]] directed the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/movies/2010/11/sacha-baron-cohen-the-dictator-goat-larry-charles.html | work=Los Angeles Times | title=A 'Borat' reunion on Sacha Baron Cohen's 'Dictator'? | date=15 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main target of the film's satire was [[Libya]]n dictator [[Muammar Gaddafi]], who was still alive when the film was written.&lt;ref name="freshair"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/05/21/153204627/sacha-baron-cohen-the-fresh-air-interview|title=Sacha Baron Cohen: The Fresh Air Interview|publisher=NPR|date=21 May 2012|accessdate=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The producers of the film were concerned it would anger Gaddafi, possibly even resulting in a terrorist attack, so they released deliberate misinformation saying that the film was loosely based on a romance novel written by former [[Iraq]]i dictator [[Saddam Hussein]].&lt;ref name="freshair" /&gt;

On 26 February 2012, Baron Cohen was allegedly banned from attending the [[84th Academy Awards]] in his role as Admiral General Aladeen but the rumour was denied by the Academy, saying "we haven't banned him, he is lying" but made it clear that "Cohen is not welcome to use the red carpet as a platform for a promotional stunt".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Academy: Sacha Baron Cohen Not 'Banned' From Oscars But 'Dictator' Stunt Unwelcome | date=22 February 2012| first=Matthew | last=Belloni | url= http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/oscars-sacha-baron-cohen-not-banned-the-dictator-293929 | work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cohen eventually appeared at the awards' red carpet with a pair of [[Amazonian Guard|uniformed female bodyguards]], holding an [[urn]] which he claimed was filled with the ashes of [[Kim Jong-il]]. The "ashes", which Baron Cohen admitted to Howard Stern on the Tuesday, 8 May 2012 episode of ''The Howard Stern Show'' were flour, were "accidentally" spilled onto [[Ryan Seacrest]].

===Erran Morad===
{{Main|Who Is America?}}

Baron Cohen portrays various characters in ''[[Who Is America?]]'', with the most prominent and controversial being Erran Morad, an Israeli anti-terrorism expert. The character is referred to as either colonel (and later captain, general, sergeant, and brigadier) in the Israeli military, and not a former agent of [[Mossad]]. Before ''Who Is America?'' aired on Showtime, some conservative public figures made statements saying that Baron Cohen had deceived them while in character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Pedersen |first1=Erik |title=Sacha Baron Cohen Also Duped Ex-Congressman Joe Walsh&amp;nbsp;– Who's Not Thrilled About It |url=https://deadline.com/2018/07/sacha-baron-cohen-duped-joe-walsh-who-is-america-showtime-1202424785/ |website=Deadline Hollywood |accessdate=July 11, 2018 |date=July 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Haring |first1=Bruce |title=Sacha Baron Cohen Adds Alabama Judge Roy Moore To His Showtime Spoof Victims |url=https://deadline.com/2018/07/sacha-baron-cohen-adds-alabama-judge-roy-moore-to-his-showtime-spoof-victims-1202425938/ |website=Deadline Hollywood |accessdate=July 12, 2018 |date=July 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Resnick |first1=Gideon |title=Sacha Baron Cohen's Latest Victim Is GOP Rep.

He also interviews other conservatives, such as [[Dana Rohrabacher]], [[Joe Wilson (American politician)|Joe Wilson]], and [[Joe Walsh (Illinois politician)|Joe Walsh]], who are openly supportive. Only [[Matt Gaetz]] expresses skepticism of Morad's proposal, and declines to be in his video.

In the second episode, Morad teaches [[Jason Spencer]], a Republican state representative from Georgia, how to detect and repel terrorists by taking pictures up a woman's burqua with a selfie stick, walking backwards while baring his buttocks, and yelling racial epithets. After the airing of the episode, Spencer refused to step down, stating that he was exploited by the producers, but he eventually did on July 31, 2018, leaving the seat vacant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/07/25/entertainment/jason-spencer-who-is-america-resigns/index.html|title=Georgia lawmaker who came under fire after yelling 'n-word' on 'Who Is America?' says he'll quit|first=Lisa|last=Respers France|publisher=CNN|accessdate=July 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2018, Spencer lost his primary to a political novice, Steven Sainz, but was expected to serve the rest of his term until November.

==Controversies and criticism==
In an interview with former Tory MP politician [[Neil Hamilton (politician)|Neil Hamilton]] in 2000, Ali G offered Hamilton what was allegedly [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], which Hamilton accepted and smoked, creating some minor controversy in the British media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/607608.stm |publisher=BBC News | title=Hamilton 'shared joint' with Ali G | date=18 January 2000 | accessdate=10 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2006 UK premiere of ''Borat'', he arrived in [[Leicester Square]] in a cart pulled by a mule and a number of "Kazakh women," announcing: "Good evening, gentleman and prostitutes. After this I stay in a hotel in [[Kings Cross, London|Kings Cross]]. We will all drink, wrestle with no clothes on and shoot dogs from the window."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/oscars/9107985/Oscars-2012-Sacha-Baron-Cohen-spills-Kim-Jong-ils-ashes-on-Ryan-Seacrest.html Oscars 2012: Sacha Baron Cohen spills 'Kim Jong-il's ashes' on Ryan Seacrest] Telegraph.

Baron Cohen has been criticised for the [[racist]] or [[prejudice]]d comments his characters have made (see ''[[Da Ali G Show#Controversy|Da Ali G Show]]''). HBO spokesman Quentin Schaffer has replied to criticism concerning Baron Cohen's characters, "Through his alter-egos, he delivers an obvious satire that exposes people's ignorance and prejudice in much the same way ''[[All in the Family]]'' did years ago."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thejewishweek.com/news/newscontent.php3?artid=9732 |title=Did Ali G Go Too Far?|first=Liel|last=Leibovitz|work=[[The Jewish Week]]|location=New York|date=26 August 2004|accessdate=10 February 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040826111026/http://www.thejewishweek.com/news/newscontent.php3?artid=9732|archivedate=26 August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding his portrayal as the anti-Semitic Borat, Baron Cohen says the segments are a "dramatic demonstration of how racism feeds on dumb conformity, as much as rabid bigotry", rather than a display of racism by Baron Cohen himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20070323100516/https://movies.yahoo.com/mv/news/va/20060908/115774501000.html|title=Yahoo! Movies: Movie News -|date=2007-03-23|access-date=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Borat essentially works as a tool. By himself being anti-Semitic, he lets people lower their guard and expose their own prejudice", Baron Cohen explains.&lt;ref name=rollingstone/&gt; Addressing the same topic in an [[NPR]] interview with Robert Siegel, Baron Cohen said "I think that's quite an interesting thing with Borat, which is people really let down their guard with him because they're in a room with somebody who seems to have these outrageous opinions. They sometimes feel much more relaxed about letting their own outrageous, politically incorrect, prejudiced opinions come out."&lt;ref name=npr1&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=3613548|first=Robert|last=Siegel|title=Ali G: Fooling Serious Interviewees, All for a Laugh|publisher=[[NPR]] |date=23 July 2004 |accessdate=31 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baron Cohen, the grandson of a [[Holocaust survivor]], says he also wishes in particular to expose the role of indifference in that [[genocide]]. "When I was in university, there was this major historian of the [[Third Reich]], [[Ian Kershaw]], who said, 'The path to [[Auschwitz]] was paved with indifference.' I know it's not very funny being a comedian talking about the Holocaust, but it's an interesting idea that not everyone in Germany had to be a raving anti-Semite. They just had to be [[apathetic]]."&lt;ref name=rollingstone/&gt; Regarding the enthusiastic response to his song, "[[In My Country There Is Problem]]" (also known as "Throw the Jew Down the Well"), he says, "Did it reveal that they were anti-Semitic? Perhaps. But maybe it just revealed that they were indifferent to anti-Semitism."&lt;ref name=rollingstone/&gt;

Baron Cohen walked onto the runway during the [[Ágatha Ruiz de la Prada]] fashion show in [[Milan]] on 26 September 2008. In the character of one of his alter-egos Brüno, he was wearing a costume made out of [[velcro]]. He appeared on the stage with a blanket and items of clothing stuck to his velcro suit. Lights were turned off while security intervened and escorted him off the stage, and the fashion show resumed normally shortly thereafter. Baron Cohen and his team allegedly accessed the fashion show using fake IDs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20080929202711/http://omg.yahoo.com/news/sacha-baron-cohen-kicked-out-of-milan-fashion-week/13579|title=Sacha Baron Cohen Kicked Out of Milan Fashion Week – omg! news on Yahoo!|date=2008-09-29|access-date=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lawsuits===
The government of [[Kazakhstan]] threatened Baron Cohen with legal action following the 2005 MTV Europe Music Awards ceremony in [[Lisbon]], and the authority in charge of the country's country-code top-level domain name removed the website that he had created for his character Borat (previously: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.borat.kz)&lt;/nowiki&gt; for alleged violation of the law—specifically, registering for the domain under a false name. ''[[The New York Times]]'', among others, has reported that Baron Cohen (in character as Borat) replied: "I'd like to state that I have no connection with Mr. Cohen and fully support my government decision to sue this Jew".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20070224150143/http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2005/11/25/borat-lawsuit-051125.html|title=CBC.ca Arts – British comic responds to legal threat against 'Borat'|date=2007-02-24|access-date=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was, however, defended by [[Dariga Nazarbayeva]], a politician and the daughter of Kazakhstan President [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]], who stated, "We should not be afraid of humour and we shouldn't try to control everything..."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20070211132450/http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2006/04/21/borat-kazakhstan-defence.html?ref=rss|title=CBC.ca Arts – Daughter of Kazakhstan's president defends Borat|date=2007-02-11|access-date=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deputy foreign minister of Kazakhstan later invited Baron Cohen to visit the country, stating that he could learn that "women drive cars, wine is made of grapes, and Jews are free to go to synagogues".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6066040.stm "Kazakh invite for Borat creator"], BBC News, 19 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; After the success of the ''Borat'' film, the Kazakh government, including the president, altered their stance on Baron Cohen's parody, tacitly recognising the invaluable press coverage the controversy created for their country.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders, Robert A.

Baron Cohen encountered another problem around his Borat character. Two of the three [[University of South Carolina]] students who appear in ''Borat'' sued the filmmakers, alleging that they were duped into signing release forms while drunk, and that false promises were made that the footage was for a documentary that would never be screened in the US. On 11 December 2006, a [[Los Angeles]] judge denied the pair a restraining order to remove them from the film. The lawsuit was dismissed in February 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://defamer.com/hollywood/celeb-jurisprudence/borat-frat-boys-lawsuit-dismissed-by-judge-who-secretly-knows-sacha-baron-cohens-golden-globes-speech-by-heart-237454.php |title=Borat Frat Boys Lawsuit Dismissed By Judge Who Secretly Knows Sacha Baron Cohen's Golden Globes Speech By Heart |publisher=Defamer.com |date=16 February 2007 |accessdate=31 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201171926/http://defamer.com/hollywood/celeb-jurisprudence/borat-frat-boys-lawsuit-dismissed-by-judge-who-secretly-knows-sacha-baron-cohens-golden-globes-speech-by-heart-237454.php |archivedate=1 February 2009  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 May 2009, a charity worker at a seniors' bingo game sued Baron Cohen, claiming an incident shot for ''Brüno'' at a charity bingo tournament left her disabled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20110823054628/http://newsbizarre.com/2009/06/richelle-olson-bruno-austrian.html|title=The News Bizarre: Richelle Olson : Bruno the Austrian Fashionista Sued|date=2011-08-23|access-date=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the worker later retracted her statement, saying the "actor never struck her", but that he "beat her down emotionally to the point she's now confined to a wheelchair".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tmz.com/2009/07/10/sacha-baron-cohen-bingo-re-sued/ |title=Sacha Baron Cohen – BINGO!

Aita, a former member of [[Fatah]], alleges that he has been [[defamed]] by false accusations that he is a terrorist.

For much of the early part of his career Baron Cohen tended to avoid doing interviews out of character. However, in 2004, he did the talk show circuit appearing as himself on ''Late Show with David Letterman'', ''[[The Opie and Anthony Show]]'', ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://howardstern.com/rundown.hs?j=n&amp;d=1093158000 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=12 November 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061031020450/http://www.howardstern.com/rundown.hs?j=n&amp;d=1093158000 |archivedate=31 October 2006  }} The Howard Stern Show&lt;/ref&gt; and others in order to promote the forthcoming season of his show on HBO. He was also interviewed on NPR's ''[[All Things Considered]]''.&lt;ref name=npr1/&gt; He also did an interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', published in November 2006, that the magazine labelled as "his only interview as himself".&lt;ref name=rollingstone/&gt; He also appeared in an interview out of character with [[Terry Gross]] on NPR's ''[[Fresh Air]]'' on 4 January 2007.&lt;ref name=npr2&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6723074 Meet the Real Sacha Baron Cohen]. ''[[Fresh Air]]''. 4 January 2007 (advance to 21:10 in the interview).&lt;/ref&gt;

Baron Cohen has twice presented the [[MTV Europe Music Awards]], first as Ali G on 8 November 2001, in [[Frankfurt]], Germany, and then as Borat on 3 November 2005 in [[Lisbon]], Portugal. Baron Cohen appeared out of character to accept an award at the [[British Comedy Awards]] in December 2006. He said at the time that Borat could not make it to the awards as "he's guest of honour at the Holocaust denial conference in Tehran",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6177591.stm |title=Merchant takes top comedy honour |date=14 December 2006 |publisher=BBC News|accessdate=1 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; referring to the [[International Conference to Review the Global Vision of the Holocaust]].

''Borat'' director [[Larry Charles]] explains that Baron Cohen generally appears in character partly to "protect his weakness", by focusing public interest on his characters rather than himself.&lt;ref name=newsweek&gt;{{cite web|last=Gordon |first=Devin |url=http://msnbc.msn.com/id/15560972/site/newsweek/ |title=Newsweek article |publisher=MSNBC |date= |accessdate=31 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070828075624/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15560972/site/newsweek/ |archivedate=28 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His other reason, ''Newsweek'' claims, is that Baron Cohen is fiercely private: "...according to the UK press, his publicists denied not only that he attended a party for the London premiere of ''Borat'', but also that a party even occurred."&lt;ref name=newsweek/&gt;

In September 2010, representatives for Cohen confirmed that he would be playing [[Freddie Mercury]] in a biopic about the rock singer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/hardtalk/9008440.stm|title=Sacha Baron Cohen to play Freddie Mercury in film|work=[[HARDtalk]]|publisher=BBC News |date=17 September 2010|accessdate=17 September 2010|first=Brian|last=May|authorlink=Brian May}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1648051/20100916/mercury_freddie.jhtml |title=Sacha Baron Cohen To Play Freddie Mercury 'Borat' star will portray legendary Queen frontman. |author=Mawuse Ziegbe |date=16 September 2010 |work=MTV |accessdate=17 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He dropped out of the project in July 2013, citing "creative differences" between him and the surviving members of [[Queen (band)|Queen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deadline.com/2013/07/sacha-baron-cohen-exits-freddie-mercury-biopic/|title=Sacha Baron Cohen Exits Freddie Mercury Biopic Over Creative Differences With Queen|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=22 July 2013|accessdate=22 July 2013|first=Nikki|last=Finke|authorlink=Nikki Finke}}&lt;/ref&gt; Queen guitarist Brian May later said that even though the band and Baron Cohen were on good terms, they felt that Cohen's presence would be "distracting".&lt;ref&gt;[http://ultimateclassicrock.com/brian-may-speaks-on-queen-biopic-problems/ BRIAN MAY SPEAKS ON QUEEN BIOPIC PROBLEMS]. ''Ultimate Classic Rock''. 19 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Baron Cohen shot a spread with [[supermodel]] [[Alessandra Ambrosio]] for ''[[Marie Claire]]'' magazine to promote the film ''Brüno''.&lt;ref name=elite&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elitemodels.com/details.aspx?navbtn=1&amp;city=NY&amp;modelid=245266&amp;pic=472.jpg&amp;subid=4670&amp;mainsubid=4670&amp;io=&amp;indx=1/ |title=Marie Claire Spread |publisher=Elitemodels.com |date= |accessdate=31 July 2010 }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Sports Illustrated]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s 6 November 2006 issue contains a column called "Skater vs. Instigator", which illustrates various amusing "parallels" between Baron Cohen and figure skater [[Sasha Cohen]], ranging from their mutually held personal significance of the number 4,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cubicao.tk/theory/4supreme.html 4 is the Supreme Number of the Universe – CubicAO] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430022623/http://www.cubicao.tk/theory/4supreme.html |date=30 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to their mutual romantic interests in redheads.

In 2010, Baron Cohen guest-starred on ''[[The Simpsons]]'' in the episode "[[The Greatest Story Ever D'ohed]]" as Jakob, a quick-tempered Israeli tour guide.

Baron Cohen's ''[[Grimsby (film)|Grimsby]]'' (''The Brothers Grimsby'' in the US) was released in 2016. He plays the [[football hooligan]] brother of a British [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] spy. The film received mixed reviews from critics and was a [[Box office bomb|failure at the box office]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/box-office-zootopia-10-cloverfield-lane-grimsby-1201728893/|title=Box Office: ‘Zootopia’ Rules With $50 Million, Sacha Baron Cohen’s ‘Brothers Grimsby’ Bombs|last=Lang|first=Brent|website=Variety|language=en-US|access-date=14 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Baron Cohen, "I wouldn't say I am a religious Jew. I am proud of my Jewish identity and there are certain things I do and customs I keep." He tries to keep [[kosher]] and attends synagogue about twice a year.&lt;ref name=borateasy/&gt;
