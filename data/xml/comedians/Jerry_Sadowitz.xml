'''Jerry Sadowitz''' (born 4 June 1961)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://companycheck.co.uk/director/920146320/MR-JERRY-SADOWITZ/summary|title=Mr. Jerry Sadowitz|publisher=Company Check|accessdate=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  is an American-born Scottish [[stand-up comic]] and card [[Magic (illusion)|magician]].

Notorious for his frequently controversial brand of [[black comedy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Brian Logan |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2007/aug/16/edinburghfestival2007.edinburghfestival5 |title=Edinburgh comedy review: Jerry Sadowitz / Udderbelly &amp;#124; Culture |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/goingout/comedy/jerry-sadowitz-brings-sick-humour-to-leicester-square-theatre-6803095.html |title=Jerry Sadowitz brings sick humour to Leicester Square Theatre &amp;#124; London Evening Standard |publisher=Standard.co.uk |date=2010-01-27 |accessdate=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sadowitz describes [[Bernard Manning]] as “the good cop” to his bad,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hello |url=http://www.blackpoolgazette.co.uk/whats-on/nothing-sacred-1-3989818 |title=Nothing sacred |publisher=Blackpool Gazette |date=2011-11-21 |accessdate=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and believes that audiences going to see a comedian should suspend their beliefs.&lt;ref name="timeout1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeout.com/london/comedy/jerry-sadowitz-interview |title=Jerry Sadowitz interview – Comedy interviews – Time Out London |publisher=Timeout.com |date= |accessdate=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has influenced a generation of comedians,  but states that "politically incorrect comedy is no genre: it’s me, and it’s been ripped off by loads and loads of comics".&lt;ref name="timeout1"/&gt; In 2007 he was voted the 15th greatest stand-up comic on [[Channel 4]]'s 100 Greatest Stand-Ups. In the 2010 list, he was voted the 33rd greatest stand-up comic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=British Comedy Guide |url=https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/news/284/billy_connolly_channel_4_poll/ |title=Billy Connolly retains top spot in C4 poll - News - British Comedy Guide |publisher=Comedy.co.uk |date=2010-04-11 |accessdate=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sadowitz is also widely acclaimed as one of the best close-up magicians in the world&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Domonic |last=Maxwell |title=Jerry Sadowitz| work=The Times |date=15 August 2007 |accessdate=10 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and an accomplished practitioner of [[sleight of hand]], having written several books on magic and inventing several conjuring innovations.

In 2008, Sadowitz published an open letter to reviewers asking them not to quote his material stating that "a very important element of comedy is surprise, and it can often make the difference between a show that works and one that does not".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hello |url=http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/jerry-sadowitz-plea-to-reporters-not-to-quote-his-material-1-1082620 |title=Jerry Sadowitz plea to reporters not to quote his material |publisher=The Scotsman |date= |accessdate=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also actively protects his intellectual property, removing clips of himself from YouTube and torrent sites within hours of their appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Richard Herring |url=http://www.richardherring.com/press/6286/interview_with_the_scotsman_about_jerry_sadowitz.html |title=Interview with the Scotsman about Jerry Sadowitz &amp;#124; Press |publisher=RichardHerring.com |date= |accessdate=2016-10-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914200743/http://www.richardherring.com/press/6286/interview_with_the_scotsman_about_jerry_sadowitz.html |archivedate=14 September 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Sadowitz was born in [[New Jersey]] to a Jewish American father who worked as a scrap metal merchant and Scottish mother, Roslyn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/oct/31/euanferguson.theobserver | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Euan | last=Ferguson | title=Unspeakable rat is just a pussycat | date=31 October 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/comedy-jerry-sadowitz-assembly-rooms-1.223587 |title=Comedy Jerry Sadowitz, Assembly Rooms |publisher=Herald Scotland |date=10 August 2000 |accessdate=27 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents split up when he was 3, and he moved with his mother back to her native [[Glasgow]] when he was 7.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hello |url=http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/joking-apart-1-485335 |title=Joking apart |publisher=The Scotsman |date= |accessdate=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="heraldscotland1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/11932503.No_laughing_matter_as_comics_pull_no_punchlines/ |title=No laughing matter as comics pull no punchlines (From Herald Scotland) |publisher=Heraldscotland.com |date=1989-08-18 |accessdate=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sadowitz attended Calderwood Lodge Primary and then [[Shawlands Academy]]. He took an interest in magic at the age of 9, and by the age of 11 decided he wanted to become a magician, acquiring books from Tam Shepherd's Magic and Joke Shop.&lt;ref name=smoke&gt;{{cite news|title=Smoke and mirrors|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/smoke_and_mirrors_1_1392485|accessdate=14 February 2012|newspaper=The Scotsman|date=11 April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="heraldscotland2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12250522.Face_of_the_Day/ |title=Face of the Day (From Herald Scotland) |publisher=Heraldscotland.com |date= |accessdate=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sadowitz was encouraged by his mother to research magic at his local library and was once kicked out of an exam after the examiner discovered his pack of cards and thought he was cheating.&lt;ref name="thefreelibrary1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/I+meant+to+warn+Paul+Daniels+about+that+quicksand%3B+The+return+of...-a061003539 |title=I meant to warn Paul Daniels about that quicksand; The return of Jerry Sadowitz. - Free Online Library |publisher=Thefreelibrary.com |date= |accessdate=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has suffered from [[ulcerative colitis]] since childhood.&lt;ref name="scotsman1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Hello |url=http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/smoke-and-mirrors-1-1392485 |title=Smoke and mirrors |publisher=The Scotsman |date=2004-04-11 |accessdate=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===1980s===

Sadowitz made his comedy debut in 1983 at a Glasgow club and secured a regular stand-up slot at the Weavers Inn pub on London Road in Glasgow. The pub was run by future comedian [[Janey Godley]], and he got the gig after her brother Jim begged her to put him on.&lt;ref name="heraldscotland2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Donaldson |first=Brian |url=https://www.list.co.uk/article/39446-janey-godley-my-comedy-hero-jerry-sadowitz/ |title=Janey Godley: My comedy hero - Jerry Sadowitz |publisher=The List |date=2012-01-05 |accessdate=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sadowitz began travelling down to London to perform at [[The Comedy Store]] every two weeks for two years, making the 400+ mile journey via [[Stagecoach Group|Stagecoach]] express coach. He moved to the city permanently in 1986, living with his mother in [[Hampstead]] until 2005.&lt;ref name="thefreelibrary1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="heraldscotland1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="thefreelibrary2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/I'M+TOO+MAD+TO+GET+THERAPY%3B+Why+anger+management+is+out+for+Jerry...-a0130107519 |title=I'm Too Mad to Get Therapy — Why anger management is out for Jerry Sadowitz Exclusive |publisher=thefreelibrary.com |date= |accessdate=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/showbiz/celebrity-interviews/2011/03/20/incendiary-comedian-jerry-sadowitz-lets-loose-on-fame-fortune-and-failure-86908-23003611/ |title=Incendiary comedian Jerry Sadowitz lets loose on fame, fortune and failure - The Daily Record |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2011-03-20 |accessdate=2016-10-26 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110325200611/http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/showbiz/celebrity-interviews/2011/03/20/incendiary-comedian-jerry-sadowitz-lets-loose-on-fame-fortune-and-failure-86908-23003611/ |archivedate=25 March 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There, he began his first job working in [[Selfridges]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-60469322.html|title=Uncovering the magic of Jerry.(Features)|date=12 February 1999|publisher=|accessdate=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early days Sadowitz was managed by anarchic comedian and club proprietor [[Malcolm Hardee]], whose provocative selling line for Sadowitz was that he was too shocking to appear on TV; this may have actively put off TV producers from booking him. As a bet with fellow comic [[Nick Revell]], he produced one of his most famous lines of that era: "[[Nelson Mandela]], what a cunt. [[Terry Waite]], fucking bastard. I dunno, you lend some people a fiver, you never see them again."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/comment/articles/2010-02/02/james-mullinger-jerry-sadowitz |title=The return of Jerry Sadowitz |first=James |last=Mullinger |work=GQ Magazine |date=2 February 2010 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001042829/http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/comment/articles/2010-02/02/james-mullinger-jerry-sadowitz |archivedate= 1 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For a time Sadowitz was considered part of the [[alternative comedy]] movement, but his act proved too un-PC with the Guardian stating that Sadowitz "shook up the right-on values of the 80s alternative comedy circuit with his willingness to say the unsayable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=James Kettle |url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/nov/09/jerry-sadowitz-interview |title=Jerry Sadowitz: his dark materials &amp;#124; Stage |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sadowitz's 1987 [[Edinburgh Fringe]] show ''Total Abuse'' was filmed at the Assembly Rooms and also released as an audio release in the form of the album ''Gobshite''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Jerry-Sadowitz-Gobshite/release/2493434 |title=Jerry Sadowitz - Gobshite (Vinyl, LP) at Discogs |publisher=Discogs.com |date=2014-12-19 |accessdate=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album was quickly withdrawn from sale due to fears of being sued for libel by [[Jimmy Savile]] as Sadowitz references rumours of the TV personality being a paedophile. Following Savile's death in 2011, a [[Jimmy Savile#Sexual assault allegations|police investigation]] into his alleged activities began. An article in the [[Daily Mail]] referred to the Sadowitz accusation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Samuel |first=Martin |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2216358/Jimmy-Savile-allegations-Why-did-listen-Jerry-Sadowitzs-howl-rage.html |title=Jimmy Savile allegations: Why did no one listen to Jerry Sadowitz's howl of rage? &amp;#124; Daily Mail Online |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anorak.co.uk/336013/celebrities/jerry-sadowitz-was-right-about-jimmy-savile.html|title=Jerry Sadowitz was right about Jimmy Savile|publisher=Anorak.co.uk|accessdate=27 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a brief run as a columnist for ''[[Time Out (company)|Time Out]]'' magazine, he embarked on the ''Lose Your Comic Virginity'' tour in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=dDNAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=RVkMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3543,1483289&amp;dq|title=No laughing matter as comics pull no punchlines|last=Young|first=Andrew|work=Glasgow Herald|date=18 August 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time he was how being managed by [[Jon Thoday]]'s fledgling Avalon Entertainment Ltd. The tour culminated in a show at the [[Dominion Theatre]] in London, the climax of which was an illusion in which he appeared from the rear of the auditorium wearing a kilt and a huge plastic phallus from which he proceeded to spray the audience.

===1990s===
In 1991, Sadowitz was knocked unconscious by an irate audience member during a performance at the [[Just for Laughs]] Comedy Festival in Montreal, where he mocked French Canadians, starting with the greeting "Hello moosefuckers! I tell you why I hate Canada, half of you speak French, and the other half let them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mysticgames.com/famouspeople/JerrySadowitz.htm|title=Jerry Sadowitz|publisher=Mystic Games|accessdate=10 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rarely quoted follow up line, which Sadowitz claims is what actually led to him being attacked was "Why don't you speak Indian? You might as well speak the language of the people you stole the country off of in the first place."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Leachman |first=Gerard |url=http://www.nottinghampost.com/q-jerry-sadowitz/story-20823645-detail/story.html |title=Q&amp;A: Jerry Sadowitz |publisher=Nottingham Post |date=2014-03-18 |accessdate=2016-10-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150707152651/http://www.nottinghampost.com/Q-Jerry-Sadowitz/story-20823645-detail/story.html |archivedate=7 July 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, Sadowitz appeared in his own television show ''[[The Pall Bearer's Revue]]''. This name was taken from an old magic magazine. This show attracted a record number of complaints and has never been repeated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0755634/bio |title=Jerry Sadowitz – Biography|publisher=IMDb.com|accessdate=27 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A typical joke on it was: "It's funny, why do you never hear anyone say the word 'cunt' on TV?" In the same year, he appeared in the music video of [[The Shamen]]'s UK number 1 hit "[[Ebeneezer Goode]]". Sadowitz later expressed regret over his appearance in the video, stating that "it shows how stupid I am. I didn't even know that song was about drugs. I don't take drugs and had I known I wouldn't have done it".&lt;ref name="thefreelibrary2"/&gt; He also befriended [[Derren Brown]], who he met whilst working the International Magic shop in [[Clerkenwell]], London.&lt;ref name="scotsman1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeout.com/london/comedy/learn-magic-with-jerry-sadowitz-new-classes-added|title=Learn magic with Jerry Sadowitz|publisher=|accessdate=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He helped Brown in his early career by putting him in touch with H&amp;R publishers and [[Objective Productions]], a production company founded by the television magician [[Andrew O'Connor (actor)|Andrew O'Connor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/drama/3591160/Can-this-man-read-minds.html|title=Can this man read minds?|first=John|last=Preston|publisher=|accessdate=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://derrenbrowninfo.co.uk/interviews/magic_cafe_interview/|title=TheMagicCafe.com Interview, September 2004 - Derren Brown|publisher=|accessdate=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/interviews/2006/07/13/3542/not_up_to_his_old_tricks|title=Interviews 2006 : Chortle : The UK Comedy Guide|first=Powder Blue Internet Business|last=Solutions|publisher=|accessdate=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which led to his breakthrough show ''Mind Control'' in 2000.

Between 1994 and 1998, Sadowitz performed as part of the double act ''Bib &amp; Bob'' with [[Logan Murray]]. His work with Murray took the form of sketches aimed at alienating almost everyone, with the duo stamping on a blow-up doll of the recently deceased [[Linda McCartney]], and tipping Murray, dressed as [[Superman]], out of a wheelchair into the audience (a reference to the paralysis of [[Christopher Reeve]]). At one show, Sadowitz spat in the face of a drunken [[heckler]] who was constantly interrupting the show. His final act was to strip naked and run across the stage, prompting a mixture of disgust and hilarity from the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/comedy--not-at-all-bad-gerry-sadowitz-has-been-lying-low-for-a-while-now-hes-back-quieter-than-ever-james-rampton-breathed-a-sigh-of-relief-1422766.html|title=Not at all bad: Gerry Sadowitz has been lying low for a while. Now he's back, quieter than ever.|first=James|last=Rampton|work=The Independent|date=15 June 1994|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/4713452/The-filth-element.html|title=The filth element|publisher=|accessdate=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Herald newspaper described the show as featuring "Pyrotechnical swearing. Lavatorial straining noises. Wanton foodstuff-smearing. Simulated sodomy. Gratuitous adoption of Indian accents, plus spitting, shouting, and penile dismemberment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12039662.Bib_and_Bob__Assembly_Rooms/|title=Bib and Bob, Assembly Rooms|publisher=|accessdate=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, Sadowitz joined the newly launched [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]], hosting his own [[panel show]], ''[[The People vs. Jerry Sadowitz]]''. The show featured Sadowitz sitting at a desk inviting members of the audience to join him and talk about a topic close to their heart and trying to get Sadowitz to agree with them. If they succeeded in winning Sadowitz over, they were invited back at the end of the show for a chance to compete for a £10,000 cash prize. If Sadowitz was not convinced or became bored during the audience member's time, he would ring a bell on the desk signalling for the show's resident bouncer [[Dave Courtney]] to escort them from the stage. Contestants on the show were regularly verbally abused by Sadowitz, and over the course of the series no one managed to win the cash prize. The show led to the channel being reprimanded by the [[Broadcasting Standards Commission]], after they concluded that the repeated use of the F and C words "had a cumulative effect that was both excessive and unnecessary".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12334919.Sadowitz_reprimand/|title=Sadowitz reprimand|publisher=|accessdate=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, a full-frontal nude shot of Sadowitz appeared in Esquire magazine as part of a 14-page "uncensored sex special".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/NAKED%20FURY;%20Row%20as%20X-rated%20pictures%20go%20on%20sale%20in%20Irish%20shops.-a060669033|title=Naked Fury — Row as X-rated pictures go on sale in Irish shops|publisher=thefreelibrary.com|accessdate=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the reprimand, Sadowitz continued to work with Channel 5, co-presenting ''The Jerry Atrick Show'' between 2000 and 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b85978c09|title=The Jerry Atrick Show[17/12/2000] (2000)|publisher=|accessdate=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000–present===

In the early 2000s, Sadowitz began performing close-up magic shows in small venues, where the focus was on the tricks and the offensive patter forming an incidental, yet still angry and obscene, part of the act.

In 2005, Sadowitz performed two separate shows at that years [[Edinburgh Fringe]], a stand up comedy show (''Not For The Easily Offended'') at The Queens Hall and ''Jerry Sadowitz – Card Tricks &amp; Close Up Magic'' at The Assembly Rooms. The comedy show included a character named "Rabbi Burns", a cross between a Jew and [[Robert Burns|the famous Scottish poet]]. He performed a similar series of shows at the [[Soho Theatre]] in London between December 2006 and January 2007.

In 2006 he toured his "Equal Opportunities Offender" show&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/950289.Jerry_Sadowitz___Equal_Oportunities_Offender__Corn_Exchange__Brighton__Sunday__October_8/?ref=arc|title=Jerry Sadowitz - Equal Opportunities Offender, Corn Exchange, Brighton, Sunday, October 8|publisher=|accessdate=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and broke the Soho box office record for ticket sales when he performed his close up magic show at the [[Soho Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Domonic |last=Maxwell |title=Jerry Sadowitz|work=The Times |date=15 August 2007 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2007, he performed his Edinburgh Festival show "Comedian, Magician, Psychopath" to a sold out crowd at the Underbelly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2007/jerry-sadowitz-comedian-magician-psychopath-review-at-underbelly-udderbelly-edinburgh/|title=Jerry Sadowitz - Comedian, Magician, Psychopath review at Underbelly Udderbelly Edinburgh - Review - Theatre - The Stage|publisher=|accessdate=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2008 as part of the [[Glasgow Comedy Festival]], Sadowitz sold out the [[Theatre Royal, Glasgow|Theatre Royal]]. He performed the show "Comedian, Magician, Psychopath 2: Because I Still Have to Pay the Rent" at the [[Edinburgh Comedy Festival]] in 2008. In this show he celebrated the [[2008 Sichuan earthquake]], making stereotypical references to Chinese people. In December 2008 Sadowitz sold out the [[Queen Elizabeth Hall]] on the Southbank, London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/features/jerry-sadowitz--talking-through-his-hat-562890.html|title=Jerry Sadowitz : Talking through his hat|last=Hall|first=Julian|date=11 May 2004|location=London|work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2010, Sadowitz has performed several runs at the Leicester Square Theatre in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leicestersquaretheatre.com/lqt/show/S1259244921/Jerry+Sadowitz|title=Jerry Sadowitz is Back|publisher=The Leicester Square Theatre|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101216024140/http://www.leicestersquaretheatre.com/lqt/show/S1259244921/Jerry+Sadowitz|archivedate=16 December 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2011, Sadowitz recorded two of these performances with the intention of releasing a DVD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thebrokenbones.wordpress.com/2011/03/23/jerry-sadowitz-is-filming-a-dvd/|title=Jerry Sadowitz is filming a DVD|publisher=Broken Bones}}&lt;/ref&gt; The release was shelved after he changed his mind about releasing anything, stating that "I don’t want people looking at me on a DVD for the first time – and there are loads of people who haven’t seen me – and thinking: "Oh, he’s a bit like [[Frankie Boyle]]. Oh, he’s a bit like [[Ricky Gervais]], he’s a bit like [[Jimmy Carr]] or [[Chubby Brown]]. I’ve heard [[Doug Stanhope]] do that..." So I don’t want people saying that about me."&lt;ref name="timeout1"/&gt;
In 2012, after Sadowitz's first UK wide tour in many years he is quoted as saying he didn't make a penny from the tour{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}.
Sadowitz appeared in the 2012 [[Kathy Burke]] comedy-drama ''Walking and Talking'' on [[Sky Atlantic]], playing the character Jimmy the Jew.
A stand up tourette 'Comedian, Magician, Bawbag !' in February 2013 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.comedy.co.uk/live/feature/jerry_sadowitz_2013_interview/|title=Jerry Sadowitz interview - British Comedy Guide|first=British Comedy|last=Guide|date=26 January 2013|publisher=|accessdate=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and close up magic and comedy 'Comedian, Magician, Psychopath! in the spring of 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.comedy.co.uk/live/feature/jerry_sadowitz_angry_interview/|title=Jerry Sadowitz interview 2014 - British Comedy Guide|first=British Comedy|last=Guide|date=19 February 2014|publisher=|accessdate=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; when Sadowitz was promoted by an unknown friend, seemed to put Sadowitz back on the circuit with several sold out shows including Manchester, Leeds, Brighton,Glasgow and Inverness.
In 2016, Sadowitz launched the "Trick of the Month Club" in which he teaches a new card trick every month to paying subscribers. In late 2016 Sadowitz tour "Comedian, Magician, Psychopath!" visited London, Glasgow, Manchester and Wolverhampton.

In October 2015, Sadowitz set up Farbissener Limited to promote and present his stage act.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.checkdirector.co.uk/director/jerry-sadowitz/&lt;/ref&gt; Fabissenner is [[Yiddish]] for embittered.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.translate-yiddish.com/en/dictionary-english-yiddish/Embittered&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 Sadowitz created "Magic Challenge", a live magic panel show most notably performed at the Soho Theatre. At select times throughout the year Sadowitz teaches beginners magic courses at the Leicester Square Theatre.

In early 2017 Sadowitz performed a brief run of shows at the Soho Theatre entitled "Card Tricks with Inappropriate Patter" and in summer 2017 embarked on his new show "Comedian, Magician, Psychopath!".

==Comedy style==
The ''[[Derek and Clive]]'' sketches by [[Peter Cook]] and [[Dudley Moore]] were an early influence on Sadowitz. Much of his comedy emulates in its provocativeness and sheer offensiveness (he once described the Derek &amp; Clive dialogues as "comic poetry"){{citation needed|date=November 2014}}.

Sadowitz often comments in a seemingly callous way on contemporary disasters and tragedies which have struck groups or individuals. He uses obscene language liberally and to cutting comedic effect. His comedy style combines the visual traditions of the magician, often using gaudy conjuring props, with political social and cultural observations which deliberately challenge the norms, taboos and transient sensitivities of contemporary culture. He has often been considered as one of the world's most offensive comedians. His controversial style of humour has also influenced a generation of comedians, or "imitators" as he refers to them. Comedians who now use his style of humour include [[Frankie Boyle]], [[Jim Jefferies (comedian)|Jim Jefferies]], [[Jimmy Carr]] and [[Ricky Gervais]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ents24.com/web/artist/19862/Jerry_Sadowitz.html | location=London | title=Jerry Sadowitz Tour Dates | date=5 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking on his "imitators", he said that "I'm sorry I've given some very nasty people a good living."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kettle|first=James|title=Jerry Sadowitz: his dark materials|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/nov/09/jerry-sadowitz-interview|accessdate=5 August 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=9 November 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He reacted against the [[alternative comedy]] movement by dealing in an aggressive and uncompromising way with issues of race and gender which challenged the prevailing orthodoxy of the alternative comedy scene. Outbursts of his savage comedy during his conjuring shows have sometimes alienated him from the more conservative magic community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geniimagazine.com/forums/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&amp;Number=122267|first=Richard |last=Kaufman|work=Genii Magazine|date=17 February 2008|title=The Crimp, Jerry Sadowitz}}&lt;/ref&gt;
