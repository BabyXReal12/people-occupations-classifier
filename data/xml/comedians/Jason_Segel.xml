In ''Forgetting Sarah Marshall'', Segel's character writes a "[[Dracula]]" musical performed by puppets. He also appeared in a [[Full frontal nudity#Terminology|full frontal nude]] scene in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Jason Segel Goes Full-Frontal In "Forgetting Sarah Marshall" |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/04/17/jason-segel-goes-full-fro_n_97169.html |date=April 25, 2008 |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |accessdate=April 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview,&lt;ref&gt;Opie and Anthony, 104.1 WBCN in Boston&lt;/ref&gt; he stated that the Dracula musical with puppets, as well as being broken up with while naked, were real experiences he wrote into the movie. Those cloth creatures were custom-made by the [[Jim Henson Company]], and the experience emboldened Segel to pitch his concept for a [[Muppets]] movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://variety.com/2008/film/news/segel-and-stoller-take-on-muppets-1117982291/ |magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=March 12, 2008 |first=Michael |last=Fleming |title=Segel and Stoller take on Muppets |accessdate=April 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Segel performed a song from the film, "Dracula's Lament", on the 1000th episode of ''[[The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson]]''.

For the 2010 comedy ''[[Get Him to the Greek]]'', Segel co-wrote most of the soundtrack's music which was performed by the fictional band [[Russell Brand#Music and Infant Sorrow|Infant Sorrow]]. He also appeared on ''[[The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson]]'' and sang an original song entitled "Wonky Eyed Girl".&lt;ref name="youtube.com"&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol4e-a9T4CM&amp;feature=related|title=Craig Ferguson has Jason Segel serenade his "Wonky Eyed Girl"|work=youtube.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, he voiced Gru's arch-rival Vector in the Universal's CGI animated film, ''[[Despicable Me]]'' and appeared as "Horatio" in a [[Fantasy film|fantasy]] [[comedy film]] ''Gulliver's Travels'' directed by [[Rob Letterman]] and very loosely based on Part One of the 18th-century [[Gulliver's Travels|novel of the same name]] by [[Jonathan Swift]]. Segel appeared in ''[[Bad Teacher]]'', starring [[Cameron Diaz]], which opened in June 2011.

Disney was unsure on how to take the request, as Segel had just done frontal nudity in ''Forgetting Sarah Marshall'', but after realizing that he was an avid fan, the project was approved. Segel stated that he wanted to do the film because the last film in the series to be released in theaters was ''[[Muppets from Space]]'' in 1999, and he felt that the younger generation was missing out on enjoying one of his childhood favorites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jay Leno|url=http://www.nbc.com/the-tonight-show/video/jason-segel-part-2-11-8-11/1367383|title=The Tonight Show with Jay Leno - Jason Segel, Part 2 (11/8/11) - Video|publisher=NBC.com|accessdate=August 10, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120418040252/http://www.nbc.com/the-tonight-show/video/jason-segel-part-2-11-8-11/1367383|archivedate=April 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
