In June 2018, he was charged with [[misdemeanor]] sexual battery and [[Battery (crime)|battery]] charges for allegedly groping a woman on April 5th of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://people.com/movies/andy-dick-charged-sexual-battery-allegedly-groping-woman-la-street/|title=Andy Dick Charged with Sexual Battery for Allegedly Groping a Woman on L.A.

===Other behavior===
In 2005, Dick dropped his pants and exposed his genitals to the audience at [[Yuk Yuk]]'s comedy club in [[Edmonton]], Alberta. He was ushered off the stage, and the second night was cancelled.&lt;ref name=YUKYUK&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/new/xmlfeed.nsf/mndwebpages/dick%20causes%20storm%20in%20club|title=Dick Causes Storm in Club|website=Contactmusic.com|date=April 19, 2005|accessdate=November 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2006, Dick attended the ''[[Comedy Central Roast of William Shatner]]''. He licked the faces of [[Farrah Fawcett]], [[Carrie Fisher]], and [[Patton Oswalt]]. [[Mandy Stadtmiller]] wrote about being bitten by Dick in "[[Page Six]]" of ''[[The New York Post]]''.&lt;ref name=PAGESIX&gt;[http://entertainment.uk.myway.com/celebgossip/pgsix/id/08_15_2006_3.html "Comic's Worst Gross-Out Ever"] ''The New York Post'', August 16, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2006, Dick upset an audience at [[The Improv]] in Los Angeles by shouting "You're all a bunch of niggers!" following an improvised set with comedian Ian Bagg. This was a direct reference to [[Michael Richards]]' use of the same epithet to insult hecklers two weeks earlier.&lt;ref name=NWORD&gt;(2006).

I have offended a lot of people, and I am sorry for my insensitivity. I wish to apologize to Ian, to the club and its patrons and to anyone who was hurt or offended by my remark.|Andy Dick}}

In February 2007, Dick was forcibly removed from the stage during an appearance on ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'', after repeatedly touching guest [[Ivanka Trump]]. [[Jimmy Kimmel]] called in his security guards, [[Frank Potenza|Uncle Frank]] and [[Veatrice Rice]], who assisted as Kimmel dragged Dick off by his legs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2007/02/05/andy_dick_bothers_ivanka_trump_aamp_is_f|title=Andy Dick Bothers Ivanka Trump &amp; Is Forcibly Removed From Jimmy Kimmel Live Show|website=Starpulse.com|date=February 5, 2007|accessdate=November 20, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204022414/http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2007/02/05/andy_dick_bothers_ivanka_trump_aamp_is_f|archivedate=February 4, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kimmel later said "Andy did a segment, he was a little out of it. [When Ivanka] came out, he wanted a big, wet kiss. It was time for Andy to go, so I escorted him out by his feet." Kimmel added, "He always makes me a little uncomfortable, you have no idea what he's going to do next." Kimmel also said he had spoken to Dick afterwards and that Dick was not upset about the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywood.com/news/Kimmel_Speaks_Out_About_Andy_Dick_Talk_Show_Controversy/3654087|title=Jimmy Kimmel Speaks Out About Andy Dick Talk-Show Controversy|work=Hollywood.com|date=February 8, 2007|agency=WENN.com|accessdate=July 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2010, Dick was seen exposing himself and making a commotion at Café Audrey in Hollywood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radaronline.com/exclusives/2010/10/photos-deja-vu-andy-dick-makes-his-privates-public-again|title=PHOTOS: Deja Vu!

"He stood up, took out his d*ck and said something like, 'This is me!'"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2011, Dick was thrown out of the [[AVN Awards]], a pornographic movie awards ceremony, after repeatedly groping and stalking adult film actress [[Tera Patrick]] and [[drag queen]] [[Chi Chi LaRue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/pagesix/annoying_andy_gets_the_boot_smV3yBUFLZGyjZQvnvMjGJ|title=Annoying Andy Gets the Boot|newspaper=[[New York Post]]|date=November 1, 2011|accessdate=June 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later claimed to have stayed clean for at least three months after this relapse.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

In April 2011, Dick was at a party connected with the [[Newport Beach Film Festival]]. He appeared [[Alcohol intoxication|intoxicated]], exposed himself, urinated on a backdrop and afterwards destroyed it by pulling it down. The organizers claimed that this caused thousands of dollars of damage and considered suing Dick over the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ocregister.com/articles/dick-300520-festival-quartararo.html|title=Newport film festival considers legal action against Andy Dick|work=Orange County Register|date=May 16, 2011|accessdate=September 3, 2012|author=Chang, Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2011, Dick was a guest on [[Greg Fitzsimmons]]' radio show and made [[antisemitic]] statements about [[Howard Stern]]. Dick said Stern was a "[[Stereotypes of Jews#Greed|money grubbing Jew]]" and repeatedly called him a "[[Jewish nose|hook-nosed Jew]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Adam |last=Rathe |url=http://nation.foxnews.com/howard-stern/2011/08/18/andy-dick-goes-anti-semitic-tirade-against-howard-stern|title=Andy Dick Goes on Anti-Semitic Tirade Against Howard Stern|newspaper=[[New York Daily News]] |date=August 18, 2011|accessdate=August 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dick later stated he had written an apology letter to Stern.&lt;ref name="HowardSternApologyLetter"&gt;{{cite AV media|year=2011|title=12/14/2011 Adam Carolla &amp; Andy Dick talk about his broken friendship with Howard Stern|language=English|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7ddP4Hq6Cc|accessdate=July 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2017, Dick was fired from a role in the independent film ''Raising Buchanan'' due to allegations of inappropriate behavior which, according to ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', "included groping people's genitals, unwanted kissing/licking and sexual propositions of at least four members of the production". While he denied most of the allegations, he said "I might have kissed somebody on the cheek to say goodbye and then licked them. That's my thing – I licked Carrie Fisher at a roast. It's me being funny."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gardner|first1=Chris|title=Andy Dick Fired From Movie Over Sexual Harassment Claims|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/rambling-reporter/andy-dick-fired-movie-sexual-harassment-claims-1053162|work=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=2 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It would later be revealed that in the same month he had also been fired and escorted off the set from another film, ''Vampire Dad'', due to what was referred to as "multiple, flagrant acts of improper conduct and inappropriate contact with several crew members".&lt;ref name="Vampiredad"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gardner|first1=Chris|title=Andy Dick Fired From Second Movie Over Sexual Misconduct Claims|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/rambling-reporter/andy-dick-fired-second-movie-sexual-misconduct-claims-1053547|work=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=2 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later said "I overtook my medication and took too many Xanax and I was a bit loopy". He said "I won't do it anymore. I won't lick anyone's face anymore. We have an agreement."&lt;ref name="Vampiredad"/&gt;

===Feud with Jon Lovitz===
On July 10, 2007, Dick and former ''Newsradio'' costar [[Jon Lovitz]] got into a physical confrontation at the [[Laugh Factory]] in Los Angeles. The two had a history of several previous disagreements concerning the death of their mutual friend [[Phil Hartman]]. According to Lovitz, Dick had given Hartman's wife Brynn [[cocaine]] at a Christmas party at Hartman's house in 1997; Brynn, a recovering addict, fell back into drug use, culminating in her killing Hartman and herself on May 28, 1998. When Lovitz joined the cast of ''Newsradio'' as Hartman's replacement, he and Dick got into an argument in which Lovitz reportedly said, "I wouldn't be here if you hadn't given Brynn coke in the first place." Lovitz reportedly later apologized to Dick for the remark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Caitlin|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/dick-and-lovitz-fight-over-the-dead|title=Dick and Lovitz Fight over the Dead|website=[[CBS News]]|date=July 17, 2007|accessdate=November 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2007, Dick approached Lovitz at a restaurant and said "I put the Phil Hartman hex on you—you're the next to die."&lt;ref name="cbsnews"&gt;{{cite web|last=Faber|first=Judy|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/lovitz-speaks-out-on-dustup-with-andy-dick|title=Jon Lovitz Speaks Out on Dustup with Andy Dick|website=CBS News|date=July 18, 2007|accessdate=November 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the Laugh Factory, Lovitz demanded an apology from Dick, who refused and accused Lovitz of blaming him for Hartman's death. Lovitz then smashed Dick's head into the bar.&lt;ref name="cbsnews"/&gt;
