'''Thomas Andrew Lehrer''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|ɛər|ər}}; born April 9, 1928) is a retired American musician, [[singer-songwriter]], [[satire|satirist]], and [[mathematician]]. He has lectured on [[mathematics]] and [[musical theater]]. He is best known for the pithy, humorous songs he recorded in the 1950s and 1960s.

Lehrer’s work often parodies popular song forms, though he usually creates original melodies when doing so. A notable exception is ''[[The Elements (song)|The Elements]]'', where he sets the names of the [[chemical element]]s to the tune of the [[Major-General's song]] from [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s ''[[Pirates of Penzance]]''. Lehrer's early work typically dealt with non-topical subject matter and was noted for its [[black humor]] in songs such as ''Poisoning Pigeons in the Park''. In the 1960s, he produced a number of songs that dealt with social and political issues of the day, particularly when he wrote for the U.S. version of the television show ''[[That Was the Week That Was]]''. Despite their topical subjects and references, the popularity of these songs has endured; Lehrer quoted a friend's explanation: "Always predict the worst and you'll be hailed as a prophet."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|last=Ford|first=Andrew|title=Tom Lehrer|series=The Music Show|transcript=Interview transcript|transcripturl=http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/musicshow/tom-lehrer/3344656#transcript|date=July 8, 2006|station=[[Radio National]]|network=Australian Broadcasting Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1970s, he mostly retired from public performances to devote his time to teaching mathematics and music theatre at the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]].

==Early life==
Tom Lehrer was born in 1928 to a secular Jewish family and grew up in [[New York City]]'s [[Upper East Side]].&lt;ref name=bensmith&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Ben|title=Looking For Tom Lehrer, Comedy’s Mysterious Genius|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/bensmith/tom-lehrer|accessdate=12 April 2014|newspaper=[[BuzzFeed]]|date=9 April 2014|authorlink=Ben Smith (journalist)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Celebrities in Hell|year=2002|publisher=ChelCpress|isbn=9781569802144|page=72|author=Warren Allen Smith|chapter=Tom Lehrer|quote=He responded: No one is more dangerous than someone who thinks he has The Truth. To be an atheist is almost as arrogant as to be a fundamentalist. But then again, I can get pretty arrogant.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began studying classical piano at the age of seven, but was more interested in the popular music of the age. Eventually, his mother also sent him to a popular-music piano teacher.&lt;ref name="Songs 1997"&gt;Liner notes, ''Songs &amp; More Songs By Tom Lehrer'', Rhino Records, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; At this early age, he began writing show tunes, which eventually helped him as a satirical composer and writer in his years of lecturing at [[Harvard University]] noting the influence of one of his professors [[Irving Kaplansky]],&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, Ivars. (2013). "A Song about Pi" http://mtarchive.blogspot.com/2013/09/a-song-about-pi.html?m=1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kapslecture/&gt; and later at other universities.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Lehrer: The Political Musician That Wasn't. By Jeremy Mazner.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lehrer attended the [[Horace Mann School]] in [[Riverdale, New York]].&lt;ref name=bensmith/&gt;&lt;ref name=toobin&gt;{{cite web|first=Jeffrey R |last=Toobin |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1981/11/9/tom-lehrer-pbrbumors-to-the-contrary/ |title=Tom Lehrer |work=The Harvard Crimson |date=1981-11-09 |accessdate=2012-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also attended [[Camp Androscoggin]], both as a camper and a counselor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.summercore.com/ronin |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120201005628/http://www.summercore.com/ronin/ |archivedate=2012-02-01 |title=The Elements by Tom Lehrer |accessdate=2013-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lehrer was considered a child prodigy and entered [[Harvard College]] at the age of 15 after graduating from [[Loomis Chaffee School]].&lt;ref name=bensmith/&gt; As a mathematics undergraduate student at Harvard College, he began to write [[comic song]]s to entertain his friends, including "[[Fight Fiercely, Harvard]]" (1945). Those songs were later named ''The Physical Revue'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ww3.haverford.edu/physics/songs/lehrer/physrev.htm |title=The Physical Revue, by Tom Lehrer |publisher=Ww3.haverford.edu |date=2003-10-22 |accessdate=2015-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; a joking reference to a leading scientific journal, ''The [[Physical Review]]''.

==Academic and military career==
Lehrer earned his [[Bachelor of Arts]] in mathematics ([[Latin honors|''magna cum laude'']]) from [[Harvard University]] in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dmdb.org/lehrer/bio.html |title=Tom Lehrer Biography |publisher=Dmdb.org |date= |accessdate=2015-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received his [[Master of Arts|MA]] degree the next year, and was inducted into [[Phi Beta Kappa Society|Phi Beta Kappa]].{{Citation needed|date = April 2018}} He taught classes at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], Harvard, [[Wellesley College|Wellesley]], and the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]].{{Citation needed|date = April 2018}}

He remained in Harvard's doctoral program for several years, taking time out for his musical career and to work as a researcher at the [[Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory]]. He was drafted into the U.S. Army from 1955 to 1957, working at the [[NSA]]. (Lehrer has stated that he invented the [[Jell-O shots|Jell-O Shot]] during this time, as a means of circumventing liquor restrictions.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfweekly.com/2000-04-19/news/that-was-the-wit-that-was/ |title=That Was the Wit That Was |first=Jack |last=Boulware |work=[[SF Weekly]] |date=2000-04-19 |accessdate=2013-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; These experiences became fodder for songs, e.g., ''The Wild West Is Where I Want to Be'' and ''It Makes a Fellow Proud to Be a Soldier''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1U2fpzw4qNI |title=The Wild West Is Where I Want To Be: spoken introduction |first=Tom |last=Lehrer |work=[[The Remains of Tom Lehrer]] |date=2000-05-23 |accessdate=2018-08-15}} &lt;/ref&gt; It was many years before Lehrer publicly revealed having been assigned to the NSA, since the mere fact of its existence was classified at the time; this left him in the interesting position of implicitly using nuclear weapons work as a cover story for something more sensitive.

Despite holding a master's degree in an era when American conscripts often lacked a [[high school diploma]], Lehrer served as an [[enlisted soldier]], achieving the rank of [[Specialist (rank)|Specialist Third Class]] (later retitled "Specialist-4" and currently "Specialist"), which he described as being a "[[Corporal#United States Army|corporal]] [[Minister without portfolio|without portfolio]]."&lt;ref&gt;Monologue self-introduction on ''[[Tom Lehrer Revisited]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1960, Lehrer returned to full-time studies at Harvard,&lt;ref name=toobin/&gt; but in 1965 gave up on his mathematical dissertation about the subject of [[Mode (statistics)|modes]] in statistics, after working on it intermittently for 15 years.&lt;ref name=bensmith/&gt;

From 1962, he taught in the [[political science]] department at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_g1epc/is_bio/ai_2419200709/ |title=Tom Lehrer |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120709231900/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_g1epc/is_bio/ai_2419200709/ |archivedate=July 9, 2012 |last=Longley |first=Eric |work=[[St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture]] |publisher=CBS Interactive Resource Library |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, he joined the faculty of the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]], teaching an introductory course entitled ''The Nature of Mathematics'' to liberal arts majors—"math for tenors," according to Lehrer. He also taught a class in [[musical theater]]. He occasionally performed songs in his lectures, primarily those relating to the topic.&lt;ref name=kapslecture&gt;Lehrer performance excerpt, {{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/lehrer |title=Irving "Kaps" Kaplansky's 80th Birthday Celebration|publisher=Archive.org |date=1997 |accessdate=2015-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Lehrer taught his last mathematics class (on the topic of [[infinity]]) and retired from academia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spectator.org/articles/33723/whatever-happened-tom-lehrer |title=Whatever Happened to Tom Lehrer? &amp;#124; The American Spectator |publisher=Spectator.org |date= |accessdate=2015-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tom Lehrer|url=https://localwiki.org/santacruz/Tom_Lehrer|website=localwiki|accessdate=23 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has remained in the area, and in 2003 said he still "hangs out" around the University of California, Santa Cruz.&lt;ref name="smh" /&gt;

===Mathematical publications===
The [[American Mathematical Society]] database lists him as co-author of two papers:

Lehrer |title=Random walks with restraining barrier as applied to the biased binary counter |journal=Journal of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics |volume=6 |number=1 |date=March 1958 |pages=1–14 |mr=0094856 |jstor=2098858 |doi=10.1137/0106001}}

==Musical career==
===Style and Influences ===
Lehrer was mainly influenced by [[musical theater]]. According to [[Gerald Nachman (journalist)|Gerald Nachman]]'s book ''Seriously Funny'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Nachman |first1=Gerald |author-link1= Gerald Nachman (journalist) |title=Seriously Funny |script-title=The Rebel Comedians of the 1950s and 1960s|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B_Yzl5uXacwC |location=New York, NY |publisher=Pantheon Books |publication-date=2003 |pages=659 |isbn=  9780375410307 &lt;!-- 0375410309 --&gt; |oclc=50339527  |trans-title= |author-mask1= |date= |year= 2004|orig-year= |editor1-last= |editor1-first= |editor1-link= |editor1-mask= |display-editors= |format= |type= |language= |edition= |page= |access-date= |quote= |postscript= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Broadway musical ''[[Let's Face It!]]'' (by [[Cole Porter]]) made an early and lasting impression on him. Lehrer's style consists of [[Parody music|parodying]] various forms of [[popular song]]. For example, his appreciation of [[list song]]s led him to write ''[[The Elements (song)|The Elements]]'', which lists the [[chemical element]]s to the tune of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s ''[[Major-General's Song]]''.

In author [[Isaac Asimov]]'s second autobiographical volume ''In Joy Still Felt'', he recounted seeing Lehrer perform in a Boston nightclub on October 9, 1954. Lehrer sang cleverly about Jim getting it from Louise, and Sally from Jim, "...and after a while you gathered the 'it' was venereal disease [the song was likely ''[[I Got It From Agnes|I Got It From Sally]] (in later versions 'Agnes')'']. Suddenly, as the combinations grew more grotesque, you realized he was satirizing every known perversion without using a single naughty phrase. It was clearly unsingable (in those days) outside a nightclub." Asimov also recalled a song that dealt with the [[Boston subway]] system, making use of the stations leading into town from Harvard, observing that the local subject-matter rendered the song useless for general distribution. Lehrer subsequently granted Asimov permission to print the lyrics to the subway song in his book. "I haven't gone to nightclubs often," said Asimov, "but of all the times I have gone, it was on this occasion that I had by far the best time."&lt;ref&gt;Asimov, Isaac, ''In Joy Still Felt: The Autobiography of Isaac Asimov, 1954–1978''. Garden City, New York: Doubleday, 1980, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recordings===

In 1953, inspired by the success of his performances, Lehrer paid $15 for some studio time to record ''[[Songs by Tom Lehrer]]''. The initial pressing was 400 copies.  At the time, radio stations would not air Lehrer's songs because of his controversial subjects. He sold his album on campus at Harvard for $3 (equivalent to ${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|3|1953}}}} today), while "several stores near the Harvard campus sold it for $3.50, taking only a minimal markup as a kind of community service. Newsstands on campus sold it for the same price."&lt;ref name=barryhansen&gt;
{{citation|title=Too many Facts about Tom Lehrer|author=Dr. Demento|authorlink=Dr. Demento|series=The Remains of Tom Lehrer|publisher=Warner Bros Records|year=2000}}
&lt;/ref&gt; After one summer, he started to receive mail orders from all parts of the country (as far away as San Francisco, after ''[[San Francisco Chronicle|The Chronicle]]'' wrote an article on the record). Interest in his recordings spread by word of mouth. Friends and supporters played their records for friends, who then also wanted a copy.&lt;ref name="Jim Bessman 1997"&gt;Jim Bessman. "Rhino Reissues Lehrer's Seminal 'Songs' Albums". Billboard. June 21, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;  Lehrer later recalled, "Lacking exposure in the media, my songs spread slowly.  Like herpes, rather than ebola."&lt;ref&gt;Maslon, Laurence, ''Make Em Laugh: The Funny Business of America'', Hachette Book Group, 2008, pg. 81&lt;/ref&gt;

The album—which included the macabre ''I Hold Your Hand in Mine'', the mildly risqué ''Be Prepared'', and ''[[Lobachevsky (song)|Lobachevsky]]'' (regarding plagiarizing mathematicians)—became a cult success via [[word of mouth]], despite being [[Self-publishing|self-published]] and without promotion. Lehrer embarked on a series of [[concert tour]]s, and recorded a second album in 1959. He released the second album in two versions: the songs were the same, but ''[[More of Tom Lehrer]]'' was studio-recorded while ''[[An Evening Wasted with Tom Lehrer]]'' was recorded live in concert.  In 2013, Lehrer recalled the studio session for ''Poisoning Pigeons in the Park,'' which referred to the practice of controlling pigeons in Boston with strychnine-treated corn:&lt;ref name="faulkner"&gt;{{Cite paper |last=Faulkner |first=Clarence |date=1999-05-01 |title=As It Was in Region 5,1949-1964 |url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1045&amp;context=icwdmprobe |journal=The Probe |volume=200 |pages=7 |via=DigitalCommons@University of Nebraska - Lincoln, ''"City-wide pigeon control in Boston, MA using strychnine-treated whole corn"''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:"The copyist arrived at the last minute with the parts and passed them out to the band... And there was no title on it, and there was no lyrics.  And so they ran through it, 'what a pleasant little waltz'... And the engineer said, '"Poisoning Pigeons in the Park,' take one," and the piano player said, '"What?"' and literally fell off the stool."&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01rqb1w |title=BBC Radio 4 – Tom Lehrer at 85 |publisher=The British Broadcasting Corporation |date=2013-04-06 |accessdate=2013-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Touring===

Lehrer's major breakthrough in the United Kingdom came with the doctor of music [[honoris causa]], which the [[University of London]] conferred to [[Princess Margaret]] on 4 December 1957 "in the full knowledge," as the public orator Professor J.R. Sutherland stated, "that the Princess is a connoisseur of music and a performer of skill and distinction, her taste being catholic, ranging from Mozart to the [[Calypso music|calypso]] and from opera to the songs of Miss [[Beatrice Lillie]] and Tom Lehrer."&lt;ref&gt;''East Africa and Rhodesia'' 1957 [https://books.google.com/books?id=h64qAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=lehrer  p.493 books.google]&lt;br /&gt;
''The Kansas City Times'' from Kansas City, Missouri · [https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/51200645/ Page 4] ([[Associated Press|AP]]), Thursday, December 5, 1957&lt;br /&gt;
''[[British Pathé]]'' quoted only „from Mozart to calypso“ [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7KVCLZuC58 youtube.com]&lt;/ref&gt;
This prompted significant interest in Lehrer's works and helped secure distributors for his material in the UK. It was there that his music achieved real popularity, as a result of the proliferation of university newspapers referring to the material, and the willingness of the [[BBC]] to play his songs on the radio (something that was a rarity in the United States). By the end of the 1950s, Lehrer had sold 370,000 records.&lt;ref name=bensmith/&gt;

===That Was The Week That Was===

In 1960, Lehrer essentially retired from touring in the US.&lt;ref name=bensmith/&gt; In the early 1960s, he was employed as the resident songwriter for the U.S. edition of ''[[That Was The Week That Was]]'' (TW3), a satirical television show.&lt;ref name=barryhansen/&gt;
{{anchor|NewMath}}&lt;!-- this anchor referenced by [[Andrew Gleason]] --&gt;
An increased proportion of his output became overtly political, or at least topical, on subjects such as education ("[[New Math (song)|New Math]]"), the [[Second Vatican Council]] (''The Vatican Rag'', a tune some say is based on the 1910 ''Spaghetti Rag'' by [[Lyons and Yosco]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bccsa.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/case-no-40-2013.pdf |title=BAIOCCHI vs CLASSICAL FM |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=27 November 2013 |website=bccsa.co.za |publisher=Broadcasting Complaints Commission of South Africa |access-date=23 September 2016 |quote= The Registrar received a complaint concerning the broadcasting of a song called 'Vatican Rag' during a time slot identified for 'classical comedy' on 13 September 2013.

He also wrote a song that satirized the alleged amorality of rocket scientist [[Wernher von Braun]], who worked for Nazi Germany before working for the United States. ("Once the rockets are up, who cares where they come down? That's not my department,' says Wernher von Braun.") Lehrer did not appear on the television show—a female vocalist, [[Nancy Ames]], performed his songs—and network censors often altered his lyrics. Lehrer later performed the songs on the album ''[[That Was The Year That Was]]'' (1965) so that, in his words, people could hear the songs the way they were intended.
In 1966, [[David Frost]]'s further BBC television programme ''[[The Frost Report]]'' invited Lehrer to contribute some of his classic compositions. ''The Frost Report'' was transmitted live, and he pre-recorded all his segments at one performance. Though Lehrer was not featured in every edition, his songs featured in an appropriate part of each show. At least two of his offerings were songs not included on any of his LPs: a reworking of Noël Coward’s ''That is the End of the News'' (with some new lyrics) and a comic explanation of how Britain might adapt to the [[Decimal Day|coming of decimal currency]].

In the spring of 1960, Lehrer toured Australia and New Zealand, performing a total of 33 concerts to great acclaim.&lt;ref name=barryhansen/&gt;
Yet this occurred during a time in which he was "banned, censored, mentioned in several houses of parliament and threatened with arrest," after which he quipped that it was "the highlight of his life."  In particular, ''Be Prepared'' drew advance brickbats in Brisbane from the chief of police, which he sang anyway, prompting wrath in Adelaide where he signed a petition that he wouldn't sing five songs in that territory.  Nonetheless, Lehrer debuted several unreleased songs in Australia including ''The Masochism Tango'' which couldn't yet be banned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stop clapping, this is serious|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/02/28/1046407753895.html|publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=March 1, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 1967, Lehrer was persuaded to make a short tour in Norway and Denmark, where he performed some of the songs from the television program. The performance in Oslo, Norway, on September 10 was recorded on video tape and aired locally later that autumn; this program was released on DVD some 40 years later. On that tour, a concert at the ''Studenterforeningen'' (student association) in Copenhagen, Denmark, where a prominent international guest was invited annually, was also televised; Lehrer commented onstage that he might be America's "revenge for [[Victor Borge]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/6funswede |title=The Tom Lehrer Wisdom Channel |publisher=YouTube |date=1967-09-11 |accessdate=2015-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 1967, Lehrer composed and performed on piano original songs in a Dodge automobile [[industrial film]] distributed primarily to automobile dealers and shown at promotional events.  Set in a fictional American wild west town, the full title is ''The Dodge Rebellion Theatre presents Ballads For '67''.&lt;ref name=barryhansen/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Dodge industrial Film|url=http://home.broadpark.no/~emeyn/tl/dodge.html|website=The Tom Lehrer Wisdom Channel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Working with [[Joe Raposo]], Lehrer attempted to adapt [[Sweeney Todd]] as a Broadway musical to star [[Jerry Colonna (entertainer)|Jerry Colonna]]. They started a few songs but, as Lehrer noted, "Nothing ever came of it, and of course twenty years later [[Stephen Sondheim]] beat me to the punch." &lt;ref name="Todd"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nachman|first1=Gerald|title=Seriously funny the rebel comedians of the 1950s and 1960s|date=2003|publisher=Pantheon Books|location=New York|isbn=0307490726|page=149|url=https://books.google.com/?id=45tG8jqrx5oC&amp;lpg=PA149&amp;pg=PA149#v=onepage&amp;f=false|accessdate=11 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The record deal with [[Reprise Records]] for the ''That Was The Year That Was'' album also gave Reprise distribution rights for his earlier recordings, as Lehrer wanted to wind up his own record imprint. The Reprise issue of ''Songs by Tom Lehrer'' was a stereo re-recording. This version was not issued on CD, but the songs were issued on the live ''[[Tom Lehrer Revisited]]'' CD. The [live] recording included bonus tracks ''L-Y'' and ''Silent E'', two of the ten songs that Lehrer wrote for the PBS children's educational series ''[[The Electric Company (1971 TV series)|The Electric Company]]''. Lehrer later commented that worldwide sales of the recordings under Reprise surpassed 1.8 million units in 1996. That same year, the album ''That Was The Year That Was'' went gold.&lt;ref name="Jim Bessman 1997"/&gt;  The album liner notes (and Lehrer himself in one routine) promote his songs with self-deprecating humor.  ("I know it's very bad form to quote one's own reviews, but there is something the ''New York Times'' said about me [in 1958], that I have always treasured: '''Mr. Lehrer's muse'' [is] ''not fettered by such inhibiting factors as taste.''")

===Departure from the music scene===
In the 1970s, Lehrer concentrated on teaching mathematics and musical theater, although he also wrote ten songs for the educational children's television show ''[[The Electric Company]]''. His last public performance took place in 1972, on a fundraising tour for Democratic US presidential candidate [[George McGovern]].&lt;ref name=bensmith/&gt;

There is an [[urban legend]] that Lehrer gave up [[political satire]] when the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] was awarded to [[Henry Kissinger]] in 1973. He did comment that awarding the prize to Kissinger made political satire obsolete,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailykos.com/story/2008/10/29/645761/-Tom-Lehrer-supports-Obama-Who-Tom-Lehrer-Who-Tom-Lehrer#|title=Tom Lehrer supports Obama ! Who..? Tom Lehrer..Who..? Tom Lehrer|first=Johnny|last=Rapture|work=[[Daily Kos]]|date=October 29, 2008|accessdate=November 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2000/jul/31/artsfeatures1|title='When Kissinger won the Nobel peace prize, satire died'|first=Todd S.|last=Purdom|work=The Guardian|location=London|date=31 July 2000|accessdate=31 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but has denied that he stopped creating satire as a form of protest, asserting that he had stopped several years prior.&lt;ref name="avclub"&gt;{{cite web|last=Thompson |first=Stephen |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/tom-lehrer,13660/ |title=Tom Lehrer · Interview · The A.V. Club |publisher=Avclub.com |date= |accessdate=2015-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another mistaken belief is that he was sued for [[Slander and libel|libel]] by [[Wernher von Braun]], the subject of one of his songs, and forced to relinquish his royalties to von Braun. Lehrer denied this in a 2003 interview.&lt;ref name="smh"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/02/28/1046407753895.html |title=Stop clapping, this is serious |publisher=smh.com.au |date=2003-03-01 |accessdate=2015-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked about his reasons for abandoning his musical career in an interview in the book accompanying his CD box set (released in 2000), he cited a simple lack of interest, a distaste for touring, and boredom with performing the same songs repeatedly. He observed that when he was moved to write and perform songs, he did, and when he was not, he did not, and that after a while he simply lost interest. Even though Lehrer was "a hero of the anti-nuclear, civil rights left," and covered its political issues in many of his songs, and even though he shared the [[New Left]]'s opposition to the [[Vietnam war]], he disliked the aesthetics of [[1960s counterculture]] and stopped performing as the movement gained momentum.&lt;ref name=bensmith/&gt;

Lehrer's musical career was brief. He pointed out that he had performed a mere 109 shows and written 37 songs over 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Andrews |first=Dale |url=http://www.sleuthsayers.org/search/label/Tom%20Lehrer |title=Tom Lehrer |publisher=SleuthSayers |date=2013-04-09 |accessdate=2015-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, he developed a significant following in the United States and abroad.

===Revivals and discographic reissues===
In 1980 ''[[Tom Foolery]]'', a revue of his songs created and produced by [[Cameron Mackintosh]], was a hit on the London stage.  Although not its instigator, Lehrer eventually gave the stage production his full support and updated several of his lyrics for the show (such as ''Who's Next'', in which [[Neiman-Marcus]] [or in the San Francisco production, [[J.C. Penney]]], not Alabama, gets the bomb). ''Tom Foolery'' contained 27 songs and led to more than 200 productions,&lt;ref name="Jim Bessman 1997"/&gt; including an [[Off-Broadway]] production at the [[Village Gate]], which ran for 120 performances in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{iobdb title|2186|Tomfoolery}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In conjunction with the ''Tom Foolery'' premiere in 1980 at the [[Criterion Theatre]] in London, Lehrer made a rare TV appearance on [[BBC]]'s ''[[Parkinson (TV series)|Parkinson]]'' show, where he sang "I Got It from Agnes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/43413/tom-lehrer-collection-cd-dvd-the/ |title=The Tom Lehrer Collection (CD + DVD) : DVD Talk Review of the DVD Video |publisher=Dvdtalk.com |date= |accessdate=2015-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|EDeRYmB4t6Q|Tom Lehrer: I Got It From Agnes}}—from "Parkinson" 1980&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, Lehrer wrote ''That's Mathematics'' for the closing credits to a [[Mathematical Sciences Research Institute]] video&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fermat's Last Theorem - The Theorem and Its Proof: An Exploration of Issues and Ideas|url=http://videodl.msri.org/data/000/022/041/original/fermat-fermat-QuickTime.mov|website=MSRI|publisher=Mathematical Sciences Research Institute|location=Palace of Fine Arts, San Francisco|date=July 28, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; celebrating the proof of [[Fermat's Last Theorem]].

On June 7 and 8, 1998, Lehrer performed in public for the first time in 25 years at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London]] as part of the gala show ''[[Hey, Mr. Producer!]]'' celebrating the career of impresario [[Cameron Mackintosh]], who had been the producer of ''[[Tom Foolery]]''. The June 8 show was his only performance to date before [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]]. Lehrer sang ''Poisoning Pigeons in the Park'' and an updated version of the nuclear proliferation song "''Who's Next?''  The DVD of the event includes the former song.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|yhuMLpdnOjY|Poisoning Pigeons in the Park}} (original version). Retrieved March 25, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000 a boxed set of CDs, ''The Remains of Tom Lehrer'', was released by [[Rhino Entertainment]]. It included live and studio versions of his first two albums, ''That Was The Year That Was'', the songs he wrote for ''The Electric Company'', and some previously unreleased material. It was accompanied by a small hardbound book containing an introduction by [[Dr. Demento]] and lyrics for all the songs.

In 2010, [[Shout! Factory]] launched a reissue campaign, making his long out-of-press albums available digitally. They also issued a CD/DVD combo called ''The Tom Lehrer Collection'', which includes his best-loved songs, plus a DVD featuring an Oslo concert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=126189232 |title=Tom Lehrer: '60s Satirist Still Strikes A Chord |publisher=NPR |date=2010-04-30 |accessdate=2015-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Musical legacy===
Sardonic composer [[Randy Newman]] said of Lehrer, "He's one of the great American songwriters without a doubt, right up there with everybody, the top guys.  As a lyricist, as good as there's been in the last half of the 20th century."&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt; Singer and comedian [[Dillie Keane]] has acknowledged&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishtheatreguide.info/otherresources/interviews/DillieKeane.htm|title=The British Theatre Guide: Interview with Dillie Keane|accessdate=December 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lehrer's influence on her work.

Lehrer was praised by [[Dr. Demento]] as "the best musical satirist of the twentieth century." Other artists who cite Lehrer as an influence include [["Weird Al" Yankovic]], whose work generally addresses more popular and less technical or political subjects,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weirdal.com/faq.htm |title=Weird Al's FAQs |author="Weird Al" Yankovic |authorlink="Weird Al" Yankovic|publisher=Weirdal.com |date= |accessdate=June 12, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518102319/http://weirdal.com/faq.htm |archivedate=May 18, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and educator and scientist [[H. Paul Shuch]], who tours under the stage name Dr. SETI and calls himself "a cross between [[Carl Sagan]] and Tom Lehrer: he sings like Sagan and lectures like Lehrer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SETI League|url=http://www.setileague.org/admin/paul.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lehrer has commented that he doubts his songs had any real effect on those not already critical of the establishment: "I don't think this kind of thing has an impact on the unconverted, frankly. It's not even preaching to the converted; it's titillating the converted... I'm fond of quoting [[Peter Cook]], who talked about the satirical Berlin [[kabarett]]s of the 1930s, which did so much to stop the rise of Hitler and prevent the Second World War."&lt;ref name="avclub" /&gt;

In 2003 he commented that his particular brand of political satire is more difficult in the modern world: "The real issues I don't think most people touch. The Clinton jokes are all about Monica Lewinsky and all that stuff and not about the important things, like the fact that he wouldn't ban land mines... I'm not tempted to write a song about George W. Bush. I couldn't figure out what sort of song I would write. That's the problem: I don't want to satirise George Bush and his puppeteers, I want to vaporize them."&lt;ref name="smh" /&gt;

[[Gene Weingarten]] of the ''[[Washington Post]]'' interviewed Lehrer off the record in a February 2008 phone call. When Weingarten asked if there was anything he could print for the record, Lehrer responded, "Just tell the people that I am voting for [[Barack Obama|Obama]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2008/02/05/DI2008020502027.html |title=Chatological Humor: A Tribute to Tom Lehrer |publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]'' |date=February 12, 2008 |accessdate=2015-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The play ''[[Letters from Lehrer]]'' by Canadian [[Richard Greenblatt (playwright)|Richard Greenblatt]] was performed by him at [[CanStage]] in [[Toronto]], from January 16 to February 25, 2006. It followed Lehrer's musical career, the meaning of several songs, the politics of the time, and Greenblatt's own experiences with Lehrer's music, while playing some of Lehrer's songs. There are currently no plans for more performances, although low-quality audio recordings have been on the internet.

Stylistically influenced performers include American political satirist [[Mark Russell]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.holecity.com/asp/newshole.asp?issue=10&amp;sec=7&amp;hole=1 |title=NewsHole |publisher=Holecity.com |date=2000-03-05 |accessdate=June 12, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013212746/http://holecity.com/asp/newshole.asp?issue=10&amp;sec=7&amp;hole=1 |archivedate=October 13, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Canadian comedian and songwriter [[Randy Vancourt]] and the British duo [[Kit and The Widow]]. British medical satirists [[Amateur Transplants]] acknowledge the debt they owe to Lehrer on the back of their first album, ''[[Fitness to Practice]]''. Their songs ''The Menstrual Rag'' and ''The Drugs Song'' are to the tunes of Lehrer's ''The Vatican Rag'' and ''The Elements'' (the tune of the ''Major-General's Song'' from ''The [[Pirates of Penzance]]'' by [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]) respectively. Their second album, ''[[Unfit to Practise]]'', opens with an update of Lehrer's ''The Masochism Tango'' called ''Masochism Tango 2008''.

In 1967, Swedish actor [[Lars Ekborg]], outside Sweden most known for his part in Ingmar Bergman's ''[[Summer with Monika]]'' made an album called ''I Tom Lehrers vackra värld'' ("In the beautiful world of Tom Lehrer"), with 12 of Lehrer's songs interpreted in Swedish. Lehrer wrote in a letter to the producer Per–Anders Boquist that, "Not knowing any Swedish, I am obviously not equipped to judge, but it sounds to me as though Mr Ekborg is perfect for the songs," along with further compliments to pianist Leif Asp for unexpected additional flourishes.&lt;ref&gt;Liner notes (translation): {{cite book|last1=Holmgren|first1=Pontus|title=Lars Ekborg i Tom Lehrer's Vackra Värld|date=2002|publisher=Amigo|location=Sweden|url=http://www.tomlehrer.org/covers/ekborgnotes1.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150621060642/http://www.tomlehrer.org/covers/ekborgnotes1.html|archivedate=June 21, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, Argentinian singer [[Nacha Guevara]] sang Spanish versions of several Lehrer's songs for the show/live album ''Este es el año que es''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tomlehrer.org/covers/guevara.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-04-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219063342/http://www.tomlehrer.org/covers/guevara.html |archivedate=February 19, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Guevara|first1=Nacha|title=Este es el año que es|date=1971|publisher=Music Hall|location=Argentina|url=http://www.nachaguevaraweb.com/portal/index.php/1971-este-es-el-ano-que-es}} Track list and lyrics (Spanish).&lt;/ref&gt;

Lehrer's song ''[[The Old Dope Peddler]]'' is sampled in rapper [[2 Chainz]]'s song ''Dope Peddler'', on his 2012 debut album, ''[[Based on a T.R.U. Story]].''  The following year, Lehrer said he was "very proud" to have his song sampled "literally sixty years after I recorded it."  Lehrer went on to describe his official response to the request to use his song: "As sole copyright owner of 'The Old Dope Peddler', I grant you motherfuckers permission to do this.  Please give my regards to Mr. Chainz, or may I call him 2?"&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |

Lehrer has said of his musical career, "If, after hearing my songs, just one human being is inspired to say something nasty to a friend, or perhaps to strike a loved one, it will all have been worth the while."&lt;ref name="Songs 1997" /&gt;
