==Early life==
Sloss was born in [[Kingston upon Thames]] and moved with his family to [[Fife]] in Scotland at the age of four. He attended East Wemyss Primary School and secondary school at [[Waid Academy]] in [[Anstruther]]. He was offered a place at the [[University of Dundee]] to study history but having decided to take a gap year to see if he could make comedy work as his full-time career, he rejected the offer after the 2008 Edinburgh Fringe.

==Comedy career==
===Stand up===
When Sloss was sixteen, his mother Dr Lesley Sloss met comedian [[Frankie Boyle]] and mentioned her son, Boyle offered Sloss work experience by writing a small amount of material for him in two series of [[BBC]]'s ''[[Mock the Week]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.danielsloss.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/dj-edinfest1.jpg|title=Let's get started|publisher=Edinburgh Festival Magazine (2009)|accessdate=28 August 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306000019/http://www.danielsloss.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/dj-edinfest1.jpg|archivedate=6 March 2012|df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was his first break and he credits Boyle for his initial success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/interview-daniel-sloss-comedian-1-1559853/ |publisher=The Scotsman |date= |accessdate=29 March 2011 |title= Interview: Daniel Sloss, comedian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sloss performed for the first time at The Laughing Horse in [[Edinburgh]], August 2007, after completing a two-day stand-up comedy course under tutor Jay Sodogar. His first set was five minutes long.

His first [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] was in August 2008, where he shared a show with fellow comic Davey See.&lt;ref name="FEFDS"&gt;{{cite web|title=LIFE IN 2D|url=http://www.laughinghorsecomedy.co.uk/freefestival/lifein2d.htm|publisher=Free Edinburgh Fringe Festival|accessdate=24 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Life in 2D'' ran for 10 days in the Espionage venue as part of the [[Free Fringe]]. That same Fringe, aged  17, Sloss became one of the youngest-ever finalists in the UK's premier ''[[So You Think You're Funny?]]'' comedy competition, the final of which is hosted by the [[Gilded Balloon]] venue during the Edinburgh Fringe.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} In 2009, he sold out his debut full length Edinburgh Festival Fringe season ''Daniel Sloss – Teenage Kicks'' and in October took this show to London to the [[Soho Theatre]] to become the youngest comedian to perform a solo season in the venue as well as in London's West End.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.derbytheatre.co.uk/performance/daniel-sloss-show |title=Daniel Sloss: The Show |publisher=Derby Theatre |date= |accessdate=2012-12-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002132912/http://www.derbytheatre.co.uk/performance/daniel-sloss-show |archivedate=2 October 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2010, Sloss's second solo show ''Daniel Sloss: My Generation'' sold out the entire run at [[The Pleasance]] venue at Edinburgh Festival Fringe. The show later transferred to London for a season at the Soho Theatre in September before returning to London during the tour playing at the [[Bloomsbury Theatre]] in November. This show became his first ever headline live tour and went on to tour Scotland throughout the autumn of 2010.

On 6 March 2011, he performed his first set at the [[HMV Hammersmith Apollo|Hammersmith Apollo]] alongside comedian [[Dara Ó Briain]] to support wildlife charity Our Disappearing Planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Dara O'Brian holds charity gig for Tropical Zoo | url=http://www.hounslowchronicle.co.uk/west-london-news/local-hounslow-news/2011/02/23/dara-o-briain-holds-charity-gig-for-tropical-zoo-109642-28220408/|publisher=Trinity Mirror|work=Hounslow Chronicle|date=23 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in March 2011, Sloss made a sell-out return to the [[Sydney Comedy Festival]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} and then embarked on a tour across South East Asia with fellow comic [[Craig Hill (comedian)|Craig Hill]].

In August 2011, Sloss premiered his new show ''Daniel Sloss - The Joker'' at the [[Edinburgh Fringe]], becoming one of the biggest ticket sellers across the fringe selling out every seat to every show for his nearly 4 week run in the flagship new 400 seat [[Assembly Theatre]] venue, still aged just 20. This was followed by a [[Live Nation]]-produced 50 date national tour in the autumn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ents24.com/web/artist/126045/Daniel_Sloss.html |title=Daniel Sloss Tour Dates &amp; Tickets |publisher=Ents24.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2012 he recorded a set for the BBC's ''Comedy Marathon'' Edinburgh Fringe showcase and in September was part of [[Channel 4]]'s ''[[Comedy World Cup]]''  panel show hosted by David Tennant, before travelling to LA to tape smash-hit stand-up improvised show ''[[Set List (TV series)|Set List]]'' for [[Sky Atlantic]] as well as perform some live club sets at some of LA's most prestigious clubs including [[the Improv]]. That same month he also featured on comic book maestro [[Mark Millar]]'s final [[GFT Geekfest]], performed on [[BBC Three]]'s ''[[Russell Howard's Good News]]'' and gave a [[TEDx]] talk, recorded in Ealing.  He then went on to perform an extensive UK tour of ''[[Daniel Sloss - The Show]]'', with more than 50 dates and produced by Live Nation.

2013 began with sell-out tours of Norway and Sweden as well as performances at the [[Altitude Comedy Festival]] in the Austrian Alps alongside [[John Bishop (comedian)|John Bishop]] and [[Eddie Izzard]], from which Daniel was featured in ITV2s documentary about the event. He returned to Australia for seasons at the [[Sydney International Comedy Festival]] and [[Perth International Comedy Festival]].

In August 2013 he launched his new show ''Daniel Sloss - Stand-Up'' at the Edinburgh fringe, again with an extended season at the Edinburgh International Conference Centre and again followed by a substantial autumn tour throughout the UK. He subsequently performed this show at 2014's Sydney International Comedy Festival and Perth International Comedy Festival.

In August 2014 his new show ''Daniel Sloss - Really...?!'' premiered at the Edinburgh fringe, again with an extended season (performing 2 shows a night on weekends) at the Edinburgh International Conference Centre, followed by a substantial European tour of 20 shows in 15 countries in the autumn as well as UK dates including 2 shows at London's Royal Albert Hall, Elgar Room.  He again performed at the [[Altitude Comedy Festival]], a week-long comedy and snowboarding event held in the Austrian Alps.

In 2015, Daniel wrote and subsequently performed his 7th show at the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] “DARK”. Along with a number of fellow comedians, including Kai Humphries and [[Tom Stade]], he wrote, co-produced and starred in 6-part internet sitcom M.U.F.F. “DARK” went on to tour for over 80 dates across 15 countries in Europe and throughout the UK.

In January, an extended hybrid version of “DARK” ran for a week at London’s [[Soho Theatre]] (rebranded “DARK REVOIR” as DARK had been performed at the London's Royal Albert Hall, Elgar Room in December as part of the UK tour.
In February, Daniel made his 5th appearance on “[[Conan O’Brien]]”  and transferred the 90 minute version of his solo show (renamed “DARK” ) to New York for a week-long, off-Broadway run at the [[Soho Playhouse]] as well for 2 shows in Los Angeles at the [[Westside Comedy Theatre]]. The New York Times featured Daniel on the front page of its Arts section

"DARK" then travelled to Australia and New Zealand for several very successful seasons in Sydney (winning the 2016 Sydney Comedy Festival Best of the Fest Award [International]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sydneycomedyfest.com.au/news-blog/sydney-comedy-festival-2016-award-winners-announced.html

He was featured on a number of TV showcases including the MICF Oxfam Gala, NZ Comedy Fest’s BEST BITS gala and on Sydney Comedy Festival’s CRACKER NIGHT.

After a brief trip to the US in June for runs in San Francisco and Madison, Daniel returned to the UK where he appeared at both the Glastonbury and the Latitude Festivals before heading back to Montreal’s [[Just For Laughs Festival]] for TV tapings and to perform "DARK". He also made his 6th (record-breaking) appearance on [[Conan (talk show)|Conan]]

His next solo show DANIEL SLOSS – “SO?”  premiered in August 2016 in Edinburgh at the [[EICC]] and exceeded previous audience figures at 11,500 and to press acclaim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/event/article-3746983/Has-Angus-got-revues-70-s-quarter-revival-young-Alan-Patridge-graphic-anecdotes-getting-crowds-laughing-Edinburgh-Fringe.html|publisher=Mail on Sunday Event Magazine(2016)|accessdate=20 August 2016|title= Has Angus got revues for you!

He then headed to Australia and New Zealand for what became 3 months of back-to-back sold out seasons and TV appearances, receiving rave reviews and culminating in "So?" being filmed before a packed house at Sydney’s Enmore Theatre.  That same year he also featured on Comedy Central’s [[Drunk History]] &lt;ref name="Series 3, Episode 9!"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/drunk_history/episodes/3/9/|publisher=British Comedy Guide (2017)|accessdate=3 May 2017|title= Series 3, Episode 9!}}&lt;/ref&gt; re-telling the story of William Wallace (hilariously portrayed by [[Keith Allen (actor)|Keith Allen]]), Dave Channel’s Dara O’Briain’s Go 8 Bit.&lt;ref name="Series 2, Episode 93!"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/tv-programme/e/fp9sgh/dara-o-briains-go-8-bit--series-2-episode-3/
