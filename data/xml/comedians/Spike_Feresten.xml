'''Michael Donovan "Spike" Feresten Jr.'''  is an [[United States|American]] [[television writer]], [[screenwriter]], [[comedian]] and [[television personality]], who is best known for his work on ''[[Seinfeld]]'', writing for [[David Letterman]], and hosting the late night ''[[Talkshow with Spike Feresten]]'' from 2006 to 2009 on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]. He is currently the host of Esquire Network's series ''Car Matchmaker with Spike Feresten''.

==Early life and career==
Feresten was born in [[Fall River, Massachusetts|Fall River]] and raised in [[West Bridgewater, Massachusetts]], where he attended public schools. Feresten then attended [[Berklee College of Music]] in [[Boston]], where he planned to prepare for a career in music. However, according to Feresten, while there he was kicked out of his dormitory for dropping light bulbs out of his eighth story window, before seeing [[David Letterman]] perform the same stunt on his show a few weeks later. "I thought, 'God, he is getting paid. This is what network television pays you to do. Maybe I need to think twice about this music career.'"&lt;ref name=collegehumour&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collegehumor.com/article:1705773 |title=Soup For You - an interview with Spike Feresten |accessdate=2007-01-20 |publisher=College Humour |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215105943/http://www.collegehumor.com/article:1705773 |archivedate=2007-12-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Feresten dropped out of college in order to attempt a career in television, working first as an [[intern]] at [[NBC]] in [[New York City]], before being promoted to receptionist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fox.com/talkshow/bios/ |title=Talkshow with Spike Feresten |accessdate=2007-01-20 |publisher=Fox Broadcasting Company |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070117175913/http://www.fox.com/talkshow/bios/ |archivedate=2007-01-17 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feresten began his career writing for ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', where he first got the nickname "Spike" while working there as a receptionist. "It came from 'Saturday Night Live'. I was a receptionist, and I had hair licks. And one of the PAs at the time gave me the nickname. And I said, "No problem as long as you don't fire me. Call me whatever you want.".&lt;ref name=tvtattler&gt;{{cite web | last= Bennett | first= Geoff | url= http://television.aol.com/tv-celebrity-interviews/spike-feresten | title= Late Night Newcomer Spike Feresten Laughs Last | accessdate= 2007-01-20 | publisher= TV Tattler}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Feresten, he started writing for the show when [[Dennis Miller]], who was hosting "Weekend Update", started using jokes that Feresten was passing on to him. "I think my first joke had something to do with Oliver North. I can't remember it. But I remember once it aired, it was like smoking crack."&lt;ref name=tvtattler/&gt; 
 
He moved from there to the writing staff of ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'' and then later the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]''. Describing the process of working for Letterman:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It's a lot of fun. You come in and read a couple newspapers and start your day with a nice appetizer of opening remarks. And during the day, you get these different writing assignments. We would write four to eight pages of jokes a day -- and at a moment's notice might be flying off to the [[Daytona 500]] with [[Mujibur and Sirajul]].&lt;ref name=tvtattler/&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the 1990s, he wrote for cult cartoon spoof talk show, ''[[Space Ghost Coast to Coast]]'', which process he described as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Two things: First you pitch them an idea that you want to do. Once they say they like the direction you are going, there is a lot of creative freedom, so they let you write it. They send you a list of people they have interviewed as guests. They have already done the interviews. They have the voice of Space Ghost ask a bunch of questions and they have a bunch of responses. You can pick your guest and see if it works within the premise of your show then you get to re-write the questions.&lt;ref name=collegehumour/&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Feresten went on to write for ''[[The Dana Carvey Show]]'', before getting his big break with ''[[The Simpsons]]'' and ''[[Seinfeld]]'' in 1995.

Feresten wrote one episode for ''[[The Simpsons]]'' during its seventh season, called "[[Sideshow Bob's Last Gleaming]]", which aired on November 26, 1995, in which Sideshow Bob escapes once again from prison and takes control of a TV screen at an airshow, demanding all television stations immediately go off the air. &lt;br&gt; Feresten has said that while he wrote and was credited for the script, it was completely rewritten keeping only the basic ideas intact.&lt;ref name=collegehumour/&gt;

== Work on ''Seinfeld'' ==
In 1995, Feresten left the late-night realm to join the writing staff of the hugely successful sitcom ''[[Seinfeld]]'' during the show's seventh season, and stayed there for three seasons until the show's finale, becoming supervising producer in 1998. During his tenure at ''Seinfeld'', Feresten received three [[Emmy]] nominations, including one for his famed "[[Soup Nazi]]" episode, which remains part of the pop-culture vernacular. The episodes he wrote were:

'''Season 7'''
* "[[The Soup Nazi]]"
* "[[The Wig Master]]"

'''Season 8'''
* "[[The Little Kicks]]"
* "[[The Andrea Doria]]"
* "[[The Muffin Tops]]"

'''Season 9'''

* "[[The Junk Mail]]"
* "[[The Reverse Peephole]]"
* "[[The Bookstore]]"
* "[[The Puerto Rican Day]]"

===Television work post-''Seinfeld''===
After ''Seinfeld'' ended in 1998, Spike went to work writing on pilots (including one with [[Louis C.K.]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvsquad.com/2006/09/25/a-fast-qanda-with-spike-feresten/ A fast Q&amp;A with Spike Feresten - TV Squad&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;) and the short-lived ''[[Michael Richards Show|The Michael Richards Show]]'', as well as enjoying a short stint as producer of ''[[The Jamie Kennedy Experiment]]'', which ended in April 2004.

==''Talkshow with Spike Feresten''==
In 2006, Feresten began his own talk-show on Saturday nights on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] called ''[[Talkshow with Spike Feresten]]''. While originally envisioned as an entertainment news parody, "Talkshow" developed into a mix of traditional talkshow segments with sketch elements, field pieces, fake commercials and pop culture parodies. Feresten described the show's format to Variety magazine as being, "all the comedy you'd find in a talkshow, but without any of the talk."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117936643.html?categoryid=1300&amp;cs=1 | work=Variety | title=Feresten talks for Fox | first=Josef | last=Adalian | date=January 23, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable guests on the show included [[Tom Green]], [[Jerry Seinfeld]], [[Jason Alexander]], [[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]], [[Seth MacFarlane]], [[Alex Borstein]], [[Andy Richter]], [[Tom Arnold (actor)|Tom Arnold]], [[Carl Reiner]], [[Tim Heidecker]], [[Vanilla Ice]] and [[Eric Wareheim]]. On the process of finding guests for the show, Feresten admitted: "We call friends. Sometimes we are very close to having our receptionist on the air. But because we're not guest driven, we just seek out funny people that we know."&lt;ref name=tvtattler/&gt;

It ran for three seasons, making it the longest-running late night television show in the history of the Fox network. From January 17, 2009, to February 21, 2009, the show had a six-week test run of hour-long episodes airing an hour earlier than usual; this came in the wake of the cancellation of [[MADtv]]. The show was cancelled in May 2009.
