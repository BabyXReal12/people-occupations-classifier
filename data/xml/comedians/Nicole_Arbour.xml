== Controversies ==

=== "Dear Fat People"===
In September 2015, Arbour became the subject of controversy when she posted a [[viral video]] on her YouTube channel titled "Dear Fat People".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newsy.com/videos/dear-fat-people-video-sparks-fat-shaming-backlash/|title='Dear Fat People' Video Sparks 'Fat-Shaming' Backlash|last=Rodriguez|first=Karen|date=September 7, 2015|website=Newsy|publisher=|accessdate=September 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics argued that the video endorses [[Anti-fat bias|fat shaming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/06/entertainment/fat-shaming-nicole-arbour/|title=Celebrities battle it out over fat-shaming|last=Hetter|first=Katia|date=September 7, 2015|website=[[CNN]]|publisher=|access-date=July 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video was temporarily unavailable on [[YouTube]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/youtube-video-censorship-nicole-arbours-account-gets-suspended-after-shaming-fat-351414|title=YouTube Video Censorship: Nicole Arbour's Account Gets Suspended After Shaming 'Fat People'|last=Castillo|first=Stephanie|date=September 6, 2015|website=[[Medical Daily]]|publisher=|access-date=July 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; over claims that it violated the YouTube terms of service, but was later restored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/06/entertainment/fat-shaming-nicole-arbour/ |title=Fat-shaming: Celebrities battle it out|first= Katia|last= Hetter|work=cnn.com |date= September 8, 2015|accessdate=September 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arbour was the subject of both public and celebrity criticism, with model [[Ashley Graham (model)|Ashley Graham]] labelling her comments as "downright disgusting".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Director [[Pat Mills (director)|Pat Mills]] fired Arbour from an upcoming movie after seeing the video and was quoted via several sources, "I'm gay. I was bullied a lot as a kid. I am no stranger to ridicule and loneliness... It's fat-phobic and awful. It went on for over six minutes. I felt like I had been punched in the gut. I was so upset I was shaking like Shelley Duvall in ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]''".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/694742/youtube-star-nicole-arbour-fired-from-movie-role-for-cruel-fat-shaming-video|title=YouTube Star Nicole Arbour Fired From Movie Role for ''Cruel Fat-Shaming Video''|last=Harrison|first=Lily|date=September 10, 2015|website=E! Online|publisher=|accessdate=September 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 10, 2015, Arbour, via [[Twitter]] denied ever having any form of involvement in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://m.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/youtube-star-nicole-arbour-fired-from-movie-after-fat-shaming-video-2015119|title=YouTube Star Nicole Arbour Fired From Movie After Fat-Shaming Video - Us Weekly|last=Webber|first=Stephanie|date=September 11, 2015|website=US Weekly|publisher=|access-date=July 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.etonline.com/news/171683_nicole_arbour_fired_after_fat_shaming_video_backlash/|title=YouTube Star Nicole Arbour Fired From Film After 'Dear Fat People' Backlash|last=Willis|first=Jackie|date=September 11, 2015|website=ET|publisher=|accessdate=September 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after the video, Arbour was fired from her job where she was a choreographer for an anti-bullying video for kids.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.people.com/article/nicole-arbour-fired-movie-job-after-fat-shaming-video|title=Nicole Arbour Responds to Claim She Was Fired from Film Job in Wake of 'Dear Fat People' Backlash|last=Heigl|first=Alex|date=September 11, 2015|website=PEOPLE.com|publisher=|access-date=May 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The director of the film she was hired to work on said it "made me never want to see her again".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

On September 16, 2015, Arbour appeared on ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]'' to defend her actions in the "Dear Fat People" video, stating while on the show "that video was made to offend people...it's just satire," and that the video wasn't supposed to be taken seriously.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.people.com/article/nicole-arbour-refuses-apologize-dear-fat-people-the-view|title=Nicole Arbour Refuses to Apologize for 'Dear Fat People' YouTube Video on The View|last=Olya|first=Gabrielle|date=September 16, 2015|website=PEOPLE.com|publisher=|access-date=|accessdate=September 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' cited an interview stating, "Arbour doesn't see her comments as bullying, but rather an intense form of truth-telling".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/4028119/dear-fat-people-nicole-arbour/|title='Dear Fat People' Comedian Nicole Arbour: 'I'm Not Apologizing'|last=Ross|first=Ashley|date=September 10, 2015|website=TIME.com|publisher=|access-date=July 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arbour was quoted in the ''Time'' article, defending her actions: &lt;blockquote&gt;I find seeing someone's head being blown off offensive ... I find children starving in a country with more than enough food offensive. I find women's bodies being mutilated for religious purposes, that is offensive to me. But words and satire I don't find offensive.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Domestic abuse allegations===
On January 11, 2016, YouTube personality [[Matthew Santoro]] posted "My Abuse Story", a video in which he claimed he had been in a physically and emotionally abusive relationship with Arbour, although he did not name her in the video. The video was originally set to private after Santoro ended the relationship but was accidentally made public.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailydot.com/entertainment/matthew-santoro-abusive-relationship/|title=YouTube celebrity Matthew Santoro says ex Nicole Arbour abused him|last=Votta|first=Rae|date=January 12, 2016|website=The Daily Dot|access-date=July 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Santoro claimed he was manipulated into isolating himself from his friends and family because of Arbour's jealousy, and was later even punched in the face.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rawstory.com/2016/01/nicole-arbours-disgusting-response-to-matthew-santoros-allegation-of-abuse/|title=Nicole Arbour's disgusting response to Matthew Santoro's allegation of abuse|last=Kasparian|first=Ana|date=January 14, 2016|website=www.rawstory.com|publisher=|access-date=July 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arbour denied the allegations in a YouTube video.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Santoro has since removed this video, and in 2018 publicly claimed he suffers from mental health issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=There’s Something I Never Told You|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpUf7N44xOY|accessdate=May 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
