'''Armando Giovanni Iannucci''', {{post-nominals|size=100%|OBE}} ({{IPAc-en|j|ə|ˈ|n|uː|tʃ|i}}; born 28 November 1963) is a Scottish satirist,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tucker v McBride: When satire met reality| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/tucker-v-mcbride-when-satire-met-reality-1668742.html?action=Gallery&amp;ino=2 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417001000/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/tucker-v-mcbride-when-satire-met-reality-1668742.html | archivedate=17 April 2009| location=London | work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; writer,  director, and radio producer. Born in [[Glasgow]] to Italian parents, Iannucci studied at the [[University of Glasgow]] followed by the [[University of Oxford]], leaving graduate work on a D.Phil about [[John Milton]] to pursue a career in comedy. Starting on [[BBC Scotland]] and [[BBC Radio 4]], his early work with [[Chris Morris (satirist)|Chris Morris]] on the radio series ''[[On the Hour]]'' transferred to television as ''[[The Day Today]]''. A character from this series, [[Alan Partridge]], co-created by Iannucci, went on to feature in a number of Iannucci's television and radio programmes, including ''[[Knowing Me Knowing You with Alan Partridge (TV series)|Knowing Me Knowing You with Alan Partridge]]'' and ''[[I'm Alan Partridge]]''. Iannucci also fronted the satirical ''[[Saturday Night Armistice|Armistice]]'' review shows and in 2001 created his most personal work, ''[[The Armando Iannucci Shows]]'', for Channel 4.&lt;ref name=BFI&gt;{{Screenonline name|id=1182836|name=Armando Iannucci biography and credits}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moving back to the BBC in 2005, Iannucci created the political sitcom ''[[The Thick of It]]'' and the spoof documentary ''[[Time Trumpet]]'' in 2006.&lt;ref name=BFI/&gt; Winning funding from the UK Film Council, he directed a critically acclaimed feature film, ''[[In the Loop]]'', featuring characters from ''The Thick of It'' in 2009. As a result of these works, he has been described by ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' as "the hardman of political satire".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/6409167/Armando-Iannucci-interview.html Armando Iannucci interview], 23 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Other works during this period include an operetta libretto, ''Skin Deep'', and his radio series ''Charm Offensive''. Iannucci created the [[HBO]] political satire ''[[Veep]]'', and was its showrunner for four seasons from 2012 to 2015. For his work on the show he won two [[Primetime Emmy Awards|Emmys]] in 2015, [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series|Outstanding Comedy Series]] and [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series|Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series]]. He followed this with the feature film ''[[The Death of Stalin]]'' in 2017 and is planning an adaptation of ''[[David Copperfield]]''.

== Early life ==
Iannucci was born in [[Glasgow]]. His father, also called Armando, was from [[Naples]], while his mother was born in Glasgow to an Italian family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dougray|first1=Ginny|title=Armando Iannucci on The Thick of It, Steve Coogan and (not) living the American dream|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2012-09-08/armando-iannucci-on-the-thick-of-it-steve-coogan-and-not-living-the-american-dream|website=[[Radio Times]]|accessdate=28 June 2016|date=8 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before emigrating, Iannucci's father wrote for an anti-fascist newspaper as a teenager and joined the [[Italian resistance movement|Italian partisans]] at 17.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ft.com/content/65876d80-ba0f-11e1-937b-00144feabdc0 |title=Lunch with the FT: Armando Iannucci |last=Aspden |first=Peter |date=29 June 2012 |website=[[FT.com]]|access-date=4 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/15611804.The_life_of_Iannucci__Armando_Iannucci_on_politics__power__his_new_film_The_Death_Of_Stalin_____and_Jacob_Rees_Mogg/ |title=Armando Iannucci on politics, power, his new film The Death Of Stalin ... and Jacob Rees Mogg |last=Jamieson |first=Teddy |date=22 October 2017 |website=[[HeraldScotland.com]] |access-date=4 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He came to Scotland in 1950 and ran a pizza factory in [[Springburn]].&lt;ref name="indy"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/armando-iannucci-how-i-conquered-america-7869871.html|title=Armando Iannucci: 'How I conquered America'|last=Gilbert|first=Gerard|date=23 June 2012|website=[[independent.co.uk]]|access-date=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Iannucci has two brothers and a sister. His childhood home was near that of actor [[Peter Capaldi]], who went on to play [[Malcolm Tucker]] in ''[[The Thick of It]]''[[The Thick of It|,]] a TV show created by Iannucci; although their parents knew each other well, he and Capaldi did not know each other in childhood.&lt;ref name="indy" /&gt; Iannucci was educated at St Peter's Primary School, [[St. Aloysius' College, Glasgow]], the [[University of Glasgow]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/mar/22/armanda-iannucci-goodle-facebook-doctor-who&lt;/ref&gt; and [[University College, Oxford]], where he studied [[English literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Interview: Armando Iannucci, writer and director|url=http://www.scotsman.com/the-scotsman/scotland/interview-armando-iannucci-writer-and-director-1-2374221|publisher=[[The Scotsman]]|date=25 June 2012|accessdate=10 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his teens, Iannucci thought seriously about becoming a [[Roman Catholic]] [[priest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Armando Iannucci|url=http://www.tatler.com/the-tatler-list/i/armando-ianucci|website=[[Tatler]]|publisher=[[Condé Nast Publications]]|accessdate=28 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He abandoned graduate work on 17th-century religious language, with particular reference to [[John Milton|Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', to pursue a career in comedy.&lt;ref name="prospect" /&gt;

== Career ==
===1990s===
After making several programmes at [[BBC Scotland]] in the early 1990s such as ''No' The Archie McPherson Show'', he moved to BBC Radio in London, making radio shows including ''Armando Iannucci'' for BBC Radio 1, which featured a number of comedians he was to collaborate with for many years, including [[David Schneider (actor)|David Schneider]], [[Peter Baynham]], [[Steve Coogan]] and [[Rebecca Front]].

Iannucci first received widespread fame as the producer for ''[[On the Hour]]'' on Radio 4, which transferred to television as ''[[The Day Today]]''. He received critical acclaim for both his own talents as a writer and a producer, and for first bringing together such comics as [[Chris Morris (satirist)|Chris Morris]], [[Richard Herring]], [[Stewart Lee]], Baynham and Coogan. The members of this group went on to work on separate projects and create a new comedy "wave" pre-[[New Labour]]: Morris went on to create ''[[Brass Eye]]'', ''[[Blue Jam]]'' and the ''Chris Morris Music Show''; Stewart Lee and Richard Herring created ''[[Fist of Fun]]'' and ''[[This Morning with Richard Not Judy]]''.

Baynham was closely involved with both Morris's and [[Lee &amp; Herring]]'s work – simultaneously at one point. Lee would go on to co-write the controversial ''[[Jerry Springer: The Opera]]'', but perhaps the most famous "alumnus" of this group is Coogan's character [[Alan Partridge]], who first appeared in ''On the Hour'', and has featured in multiple spin-off series.
Between 1995 and 1999, Iannucci produced and hosted ''[[The Saturday Night Armistice]]''.

===2000s===
In 2000, he created two pilot episodes for Channel 4, which became ''[[The Armando Iannucci Shows]]''. This was an eight-part series for Channel 4 broadcast in 2001, written with [[Andy Riley]] and [[Kevin Cecil]]. The series consisted of Iannucci pondering pseudo-philosophical and jocular ideas and fantasies in between surreal sketches. Iannucci has been quoted as saying it is the comedy series he is most proud of making. He told ''[[Metro (Associated Metro Limited)|The Metro]]'' in April 2007 "''The Armando Iannucci Show''{{sic}} on Channel 4 came out around [[9/11]], so it was overlooked for good reasons. People had other things on their minds. But that was the closest to me expressing my comic outlook on life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Williams | first = Andrew | title = 60 SECONDS: Armando Iannucci | url = http://www.metro.co.uk/fame/interviews/article.html?in_article_id=43694&amp;in_page_id=11 | work = [[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]] | date = 1 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After championing ''[[Yes Minister]]'' on the [[BBC]]'s ''[[Britain's Best Sitcom]]'', Iannucci devised, directed and was chief writer of ''[[The Thick of It]]'', a political satire-cum-farce for [[BBC Four]].&lt;ref name="BBC Comedy"&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC Comedy – Armando Iannucci|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/iannucci/|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; It starred [[Chris Langham]] as an incompetent cabinet minister being manipulated by a cynical Press Officer, Malcolm Tucker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Wardrop | first = Murray | title = Peter Capaldi: 'Thick Of It spin doctor Malcolm Tucker was not based on Alastair Campbell' | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/9049658/Peter-Capaldi-Thick-Of-It-spin-doctor-Malcolm-Tucker-was-not-based-on-Alastair-Campbell.html | work = [[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] | date = 31 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first broadcast for two short series on [[BBC Four]] in 2005, initially with a small cast focusing on a government minister, his advisers and their party's spin-doctor. The cast was significantly expanded for two hour-long specials to coincide with Christmas and [[Gordon Brown]]'s appointment as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister]] in 2007, which saw new characters forming the opposition party added to the cast. These characters continued when the show switched channels to [[BBC Two]] for its third series in 2009. A fourth series about a coalition government was broadcast in 2012, with the last episode transmitted. In a 2012 interview, Iannucci said the fourth series of the programme would probably be its last.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mellor |first=Louisa |url=http://www.denofgeek.com/tv/the-thick-of-it/23116/the-thick-of-it-series-4-to-be-its-last |title=The Thick Of It series 4 to be its last |publisher=Den of Geek |date=19 October 2012 |accessdate=10 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on a format he had used in ''[[Clinton: His Struggle with Dirt]]'' in 1996 and ''[[2004: The Stupid Version]]'', in mid-2006, his spoof documentary series ''[[Time Trumpet]]'' was shown on BBC 2. The series looked back on past events through highly edited clips and "celebrity" interviews, looking back on the present and near-future from the year 2031. One episode, featuring fictional terrorist attacks on London and the assassination of Tony Blair, was postponed and edited in August 2006 amid the [[August 10, 2006 alleged transatlantic aircraft terrorist plot|terrorism scares]] in British airports at that time. [[Jane Thynne]], writing in ''[[The Independent]]'', accused the BBC of lacking backbone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Thynne | first = Jane | author-link = Jane Thynne | title = MEDIA DIARY – The war on humour | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/why-should-newspapers-cost-less-money-than-a-coffee-412550.html | work = [[The Independent]] | date = 20 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He created the American [[HBO]] political satire television series ''[[Veep]]'', starring [[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]], set in the [[Office of the Vice President of the United States|office]] of [[Selina Meyer]], a fictional Vice-President of the United States.&lt;ref name=Parker2012/&gt; ''Veep'' uses a similar [[cinéma-vérité]] filming style to ''The Thick of It''. Debuting in 2012, the show has aired six seasons, with its sixth starting in April 2017. However, beginning with season five, Iannucci stepped down as [[showrunner]] due to "personal reasons".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/veep-creator-armando-iannucci-depart-787794 |title='Veep' Creator Armando Iannucci to Depart After Four Seasons (Exclusive) |work=The Hollywood Reporter |first=Kate |last=Stanhope |date=April 10, 2015 |accessdate=April 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is planning a new science fiction sitcom for HBO called ''Avenue 5''.&lt;ref name=prospect/&gt;

===Other work===
Ianucci's non-television works include ''Smokehammer'', a web-based project with Chris Morris, and the 1997 book ''Facts and Fancies'', composed of his newspaper columns, which was turned into a [[BBC Radio 4]] series. The radio series ''Scraps With Iannucci'', which followed late in 1998, featured Iannucci using his tape-fiddling skills to present a review of the year.

He has appeared on Radio 3 talking about classical music, one of his passions, and collaborated with composer [[David Sawer]] on ''Skin Deep'', an [[operetta]], which was premiered by [[Opera North]] on 16 January 2009. He has also presented three programmes for [[BBC Radio 3]], including ''Mobiles Off!'', a 20-minute segment on classical concert-going etiquette. He was a regular columnist for the classical music magazine ''[[Gramophone (magazine)|Gramophone]]''.&lt;ref name=Parker2012&gt;{{cite news|last=Parker|first=Ian|title=Expletives not deleted|url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/03/26/120326fa_fact_parker|accessdate=9 August 2013|newspaper=[[The New Yorker]]|date=26 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A book of his writings about classical music ''Hear Me Out'' was published in 2017.&lt;ref name=prospect/&gt;

He directed a series of [[Post Office Ltd.|Post Office]] television adverts, featuring the actors [[John Henshaw]], [[Rory Jennings]] and [[Di Botcher]] alongside guest stars such as [[Joan Collins]], [[Bill Oddie]] and [[Westlife]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://media.guardian.co.uk/advertising/story/0,,2189979,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Joan Collins in Post Office ad | date=12 October 2007 | accessdate=25 April 2010 | first=Mark | last=Sweney}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 it was announced that he was writing his first novel, ''Tongue International'', a satirical fantasy about the promotion of a "for-profit language".&lt;ref name=Parker2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chortle&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2012/03/30/15144/armando_iannucci_writes_his_first_novel |publisher=Chortle |title=Armando Iannucci writes his first novel |date=31 March 2012 |accessdate=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film directing===
In January 2009, his first feature film ''[[In the Loop]]'', in the style of ''[[The Thick of It]]'', was premiered at the [[Sundance Film Festival]]. It was the first cinema film to be directed by Iannucci, after his contribution to ''[[Tube Tales]]'' in 1999. The film was applauded by critics, both in Britain and the US,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/film_reviews/article5554802.ece | work=The Times | location=London | title=In the Loop at the Sundance Film Festival Utah | first=Damon | last=Wise | date=21 January 2009 | accessdate=31 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]] Oscar in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nominees for the 82nd Academy Awards|url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/82/nominees.html|work=The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|accessdate=2 February 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100204215537/http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/82/nominees.html| archivedate= 4 February 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The film secured the eighth highest placing in the UK box office in its opening week – despite its relatively insignificant screening numbers. According to the British Film Institute [[screenonline]], Iannucci had previously failed to secure funding for a historical comedy film in 2003.&lt;ref name="BFI"/&gt;

Iannucci used his BBC press pass to enter the [[US State Department]] headquarters whilst researching the film, saying how he just turned up and claimed to be "here for the 12.30". Iannucci spent an hour inside taking photographs which were used for the film's set designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Comedian sneaks into US State department|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/5295148/Comedian-sneaks-into-US-State-department.html|work=[[telegraph.co.uk]]|date=8 May 2009|accessdate=8 May 2009 | location=London| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090511043257/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/5295148/Comedian-sneaks-into-US-State-department.html| archivedate= 11 May 2009 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His second feature film is ''[[The Death of Stalin]]'', about the power struggle which followed the death of Joseph Stalin in 1953. It was released in October 2017.&lt;ref name=prospect&gt;{{cite news|title=Armando Iannucci on how satirists should tackle strongmen—and what makes a line funny|url=https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/armando-iannucci-on-how-satirists-should-tackle-strongmen-and-what-makes-a-line-funny|work=[[Prospect (magazine)|Prospect]]|date=6 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His next project is to be a feature film adaptation of Charles Dickens's ''[[David Copperfield]]''.&lt;ref name=prospect/&gt;

==Recognition==
Iannucci has won two [[Radio Academy Awards|Sony Radio Awards]] and three [[British Comedy Awards]]. In 2003, he was listed in ''[[The Observer]]'' as one of the 50 funniest acts in British comedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,11710,1101525,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=The A-Z of laughter (part two) | date=7 December 2003 | accessdate=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also subject of a 2006 edition of ''[[The South Bank Show]]''.

In January 2006 he was named [[News International]] Visiting Professor of Broadcast Media at the [[University of Oxford]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Armando Iannucci to lecture at Oxford on British comedy|url=http://www.admin.ox.ac.uk/po/060118.shtml|publisher=[[University of Oxford|ox.ac.uk]]|date=18 January 2006}}"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Armando Iannucci named as Oxford University's next Broadcast Media Professor |url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/media/news_stories/2005/051102.html |publisher=[[University of Oxford|ox.ac.uk]] |date=2 November 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130428042225/http://www.ox.ac.uk/media/news_stories/2005/051102.html |archivedate=28 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where he has delivered a series of four lectures under the title "British Comedy – Dead Or Alive?".

March 2006 saw Iannucci namechecked by the OED as the originator of the term "codology", with its inclusion in that year's dictionary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://public.oed.com/the-oed-today/recent-updates-to-the-oed/previous-updates/march-2006-update/#oos |title=OED March 2006 Update |publisher=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |date=16 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2011, he was awarded an honorary [[Doctor of Letters]] by the [[University of Glasgow]] to recognise his contribution to film and television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-13715832|title=Armando Iannucci to receive honorary degree|work=BBC News|date=9 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2011 British Comedy Awards, Iannucci received the Writers' Guild of Britain Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/8962988/British-Comedy-Awards-2011-Inbetweeners-and-Victoria-Wood-among-winners.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=British Comedy Awards 2011: Inbetweeners and Victoria Wood among winners | date=17 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was appointed [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] (OBE) in the [[2012 Birthday Honours]] for services to broadcasting.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=60173 |supp=y|page=10|date=16 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Armando Iannucci: OBE 'won't stop me poking fun at politicians'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-18458975|publisher=BBC News|date=16 June 2012|accessdate=16 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Surreal and hilarious': Armando Iannucci receives an OBE|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/9842425/Surreal-and-hilarious-Armando-Iannucci-receives-an-OBE.html|publisher=Daily Telegraph|date=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alastair Campbell]]'s response to his appointment was "Three little letters can have more impact than you realise", to which Iannucci replied, via Twitter, "[[Weapon of mass destruction|WMD]]"&lt;ref name=RTSep2012 /&gt; (a reference to Campbell's role in preparing the "[[September Dossier]]" prior to the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]]).

In July 2012 Iannucci received an honorary Doctorate (DLitt) from the University of Exeter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exeter.ac.uk/honorarygraduates/2012/honorarygraduates/ceremony1/|title=Honorary Graduates 2012: Armando Iannucci|work=University of Exeter|accessdate=6 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
In the 2010 general election Iannucci supported the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], stating: "I'll be voting Lib Dem this election because they represent the best chance in a lifetime to make lasting and fair change to how the UK is governed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Battersby | first = Matilda | title = A who's who of celebrity political endorsements | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/a-whorsquos-who-of-celebrity-political-endorsements-1962049.html?action=Popup&amp;ino=21 | work = [[The Independent]] | date = 4 May 2010 | access-date = 4 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|Conservative-Liberal Democrat Coalition of 2010]] was established, however, he expressed doubts over his continued support for the party, saying he was 'wavering' on many issues and has admitted to 'queasiness' over the Coalition's economic measures. He also seemed to contemplate targeting the Liberal Democrats in the fourth series of ''The Thick of It'', rather as the first three had targeted what he perceived as the failings within the Labour governments of [[Tony Blair]] and [[Gordon Brown]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Jeffries | first = Stuart | title = Armando Iannucci: 'Now is not the time for a crap opposition' | url = https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/oct/23/armando-iannucci-interview-coalition-cuts | work = [[The Guardian]] | date = 22 October 2010 | access-date = 16 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2018, Iannucci announced his support for [[People's Vote]] a campaign group calling for a public vote on the final [[Brexit]] deal between the UK and the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Iannucci | first = Armando | title = Armando Iannucci: Why I'm demanding a second referendum on the belched-up mess of Brexit | url = https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/armando-iannucci-im-demanding-second-13015951 | work = [[Daily Mirror]] | date = 1 August 2018 | access-date = 3 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1990, he married Rachael Jones, whom he met when she designed the lighting for his one-man show at Oxford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Skinitis | first = Alexia | title = Armando Iannucci – Significant Others | url = http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/stage/comedy/article6044158.ece | work = The Times | date = 11 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have two sons and one daughter and currently live in [[Hertfordshire]], having previously lived in [[Buckinghamshire]].&lt;ref name=RTSep2012&gt;{{cite journal | last = Dougary | first = Ginny | title = The politics of humour | volume = 354 | issue = 4608 | page = 23 | work = Radio Times | publisher = Immediate Media Company | date = 8–14 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is patron of the Silver Star Society, a charity supporting women through difficult pregnancies. In April 2012 he [[Abseiling|abseiled]] from the top of the [[John Radcliffe Hospital]] in Oxford to raise money for the hospital's specialist pregnancy unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/news/9663618.Comedian_takes_plunge_to_aid_baby_unit/ |work=The Oxford Mail |title=Comedian takes plunge to aid baby unit |author= Jones, Laura |date=23 April 2012 |accessdate=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Iannucci described [[Woody Allen]] as his "all-time comedy hero".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Armando Iannucci (interview) | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/iannucci/index2.shtml | work = BBC Comedy | date = 12 December 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
