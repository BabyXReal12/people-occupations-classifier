==Television career==
Handler was a member of the all-female cast of [[Oxygen (TV channel)|Oxygen network's]] [[hidden camera]] [[Reality television#Hidden cameras|reality]] television series ''[[Girls Behaving Badly]]'',&lt;ref&gt;"Cast Biographies". ''[[Girls Behaving Badly]]''. Volume 1. Season 1 DVD. Disc 2 Bonus Features. Starlight Video. December 26, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; which aired from 2002 to 2005. Other shows on which Handler has appeared include ''[[Weekends at the D.L.]]'', ''[[The Bernie Mac Show]]'', ''[[My Wife and Kids]]'', and ''[[The Practice]]''. She was a regular commentator on E! and ''[[Scarborough Country]]'', as well as a correspondent on ''[[The Tonight Show]]''. She hosted the first episode of the reality TV show ''[[On the Lot]]'', but quit before the second episode aired, saying later that she left "because I smelled the disaster happening before it did."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/07197/801962-352.stm|title= Summer Press Tour: Posh Beckham, Chelsea Handler|accessdate= January 3, 2009|date= July 16, 2007|publisher= Pittsburgh Post-Gazette}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show, produced by [[Steven Spielberg]] and [[Mark Burnett (executive producer)|Mark Burnett]], was a competition for aspiring filmmakers vying for a chance at stardom. It lasted one season. Handler was replaced by former [[Robin &amp; Company]] entertainment anchor, [[Adrianna Costa]].

In April 2006, Handler began hosting ''[[The Chelsea Handler Show]]'' on [[E!]], which lasted two seasons. In 2007, Handler performed with [[Comedy Central|Comedy Central's]] Hour Stand-Up Comedy Tour across the United States. Her stand-up comedy has also been televised on [[VH1|VH1's]] ''Love Lounge'', Comedy Central's ''[[Premium Blend]]'', and [[HBO|HBO's]] broadcast of the ''[[Aspen Comedy Festival]]''. She was a guest on ''[[Red Eye w/ Greg Gutfeld]]'' and ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]'', and she co-hosted ''The View'' on August 2, 2007, and September 5, 2008. On August 18, 2010, it was announced that Handler would be the host of the [[2010 MTV Video Music Awards|2010 MTV Video Music Awards (VMAs)]]. The announcement was surprising to many, including MTV representatives, who claimed that the final decision was unexpected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tv.msn.com/the-wrap/handler-hosts-vmas/story/?GT1=28103 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100823051322/http://tv.msn.com/the-wrap/handler-hosts-vmas/story/?GT1=28103 |archivedate=August 23, 2010 |title=Chelsea Handler to host 2010 MTV VMAs – MSN TV News |publisher=Tv.msn.com |date=September 17, 2010 |accessdate=September 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This made Handler the second woman in the history of the VMAs to be the sole host of the ceremony, behind [[Roseanne Barr]], who hosted in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=9/2/10 |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1646050/20100819/story.jhtml |title=Chelsea Handler To Host The 2010 MTV Video Music Awards – Music, Celebrity, Artist News |publisher=MTV |date=August 19, 2010 |accessdate=September 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The event took place at the Nokia Theatre in Los Angeles on September 12, 2010.

In July 2007, Handler began starring on her own half-hour, late-night comedy series on [[E!]] titled ''[[Chelsea Lately]]''. The show proved to be a hit by averaging more than a half-million viewers since its premiere (much more than the average for a late night cable program) and having clips on YouTube with more than one million views. In a 2008 interview, Handler said, "the worse the guests are, the more pathetic they are, the funnier the show is."&lt;ref name="Jacob Bernstein"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Chelsea Handler, Insult Queen|author=Jacob Bernstein|publisher=W magazine|date=December 1, 2008|url=https://www.wmagazine.com/story/chelsea-handler|accessdate=November 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Chelsea Lately'' was broadcast weekdays on the E! Network in the U.S., Canada, U.K, Australia, Germany, and New Zealand. After more than 1,000 episodes, the final episode of ''Chelsea Lately'' aired on August 26, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2014/05/28/chelsea-lately-series-finale-to-air-tuesday-august-26-on-e/268330/|title='Chelsea Lately' Starring Chelsea Handler Officially Cancelled by E!; Series Finale to Air Tuesday, August 26|last=Bibel|first=Sara|work=TV by the Numbers|date=May 28, 2014|accessdate=May 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show had a spinoff, the [[mockumentary]] ''[[After Lately]]'', in which the various cast members, writers, crew, guests and even "hangers-on" of ''Chelsea Lately'' are shown bickering over trivial matters and competing for airtime on the show. They also are shown seeking personal approval from Handler, who appeared in very few scenes of the program, and was always portrayed as having open and utter disdain for everyone beneath her. ''After Lately'' debuted on E! on March 6, 2011. Guest stars included: [[Reese Witherspoon]], [[Jennifer Aniston]], [[Jay Leno]], [[Tori Spelling]], [[Jenny McCarthy]], [[Sharon Osbourne]], [[Dave Grohl]], [[Johnny Knoxville]], and [[Jane Fonda]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eonline.com/on/personalities/bio/chuy.jsp Chuy Bravo – On E!

In 2007, Handler appeared in the Internet-based program ''[[In the Motherhood]]'' with [[Leah Remini]] and [[Jenny McCarthy]] (since January 2008). On September 8, 2008, it was announced that ABC would be turning ''In The Motherhood'' into a series starring [[Jessica St. Clair]], [[Megan Mullally]], and [[Cheryl Hines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inthemotherhood.com/node/185|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090208172112/http://inthemotherhood.com/node/185|archivedate=February 8, 2009|title=About the show |publisher=Inthemotherhood.com |accessdate=September 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Are You There, Chelsea?]]'' was an [[NBC]] sitcom based on Handler's 2008 best-selling book ''[[Are You There, Vodka? It's Me, Chelsea]]'', which aired from January 11 to March 28, 2012. On May 11, 2012, the network canceled it after only one season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/05/11/awake-are-you-there-chelsea-best-friends-forever-and-bent-canceled-by-nbc/133644/ | title='Awake, 'Are You There Chelsea?,' 'Best Friends Forever,' and 'Bent' Canceled by NBC | last=Seidman | first=Robert | date=May 11, 2012 | work=TV by the Numbers | accessdate=May 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Laura Prepon]] played the main character Chelsea Newman, a cocktail waitress while Handler portrayed Chelsea's [[Born-Again Christianity|born-again Christian]] sister Sloane, a married, conservative, new mom who had little in common with her carefree sister. [[Dottie Zicklin]] (of ''[[Dharma &amp; Greg]]'') and [[Julie Larson]] (of ''[[The Drew Carey Show]]'') were creators and executive producers. Handler served as executive producer, along with [[Tom Werner]] (of ''[[That '70s Show]]''), Mike Clements (of ''[[The Life &amp; Times of Tim]]''), and Tom Brunelle (of ''Chelsea Lately'').

In 2016, Handler filmed a [[documentary]] series for [[Netflix]] titled ''[[Chelsea Does]],'' consisting of four episodes on marriage, [[Silicon Valley]], racism, and drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/chelsea-does-tv-review-858206|title='Chelsea Does': TV Review|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date= January 22, 2016|accessdate=January 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2016, she began presenting her new Netflix [[Netflix Original Programing|original]] [[Television comedy|comedy]] [[talk show]] ''[[Chelsea (TV series)|Chelsea]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2016/03/17/chelsea-handler-new-show-on-netflix/81903844/|title=Chelsea Handler gives deets of her new Netflix show in a letter to herself|author=Erin Jensen|work=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first season streamed Wednesday, Thursday and Friday each week; season 2 streams every Friday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/chelsea-handler-netflix-talk-show-title-guests-set-1201732831/|title=Chelsea Handler Announces Title for Netflix Talk Show: 'Chelsea'|author=Elizabeth Wagmeister|work=Variety}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2015, Handler said she envisioned a show more serious than ''Chelsea Lately:'' "I would like a healthy mix of everything that goes on around the world, mixed with interesting stuff in our country. The well-roundedness of ''[[60 Minutes]]'' but faster, quicker, cooler."&lt;ref name="variety" /&gt; In October 2017, Handler announced that the show will be concluding after its second season, as she wishes to focus on activism.&lt;ref name=HR17&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/chelsea-handlers-netflix-show-canceled-2-seasons-1050194|title=Chelsea Handler's Netflix Show Canceled After 2 Seasons|first=Lesley|last=Goldberg|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=October 18, 2017|accessdate=November 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 15, 2010, it was announced that Handler's publishers gave her her own publishing [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]], Borderline Amazing/A Chelsea Handler Book.
