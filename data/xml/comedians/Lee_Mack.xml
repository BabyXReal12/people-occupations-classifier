'''Lee Gordon McKillop''' (born 4 August 1968), known as '''Lee Mack''', is an English [[comedian]] and actor&lt;ref name="Times"/&gt; best known for writing and starring in the [[British sitcom|sitcom]] ''[[Not Going Out]]''. He is also known for being a team captain on the [[BBC One]] comedy panel show ''[[Would I Lie to You? (TV series)|Would I Lie to You?]]'', hosting  the Sky1 panel show ''[[Duck Quacks Don't Echo]]'' and for presenting the show ''[[They Think It's All Over (TV series)|They Think It's All Over]]''.

He has been guest host on ''[[Have I Got News for You]]'' and ''[[Never Mind the Buzzcocks]]'', guest captain on ''[[8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown]]'', and a guest panellist on ''[[QI]]''.

==Early life==
Mack was born in [[Southport]], Lancashire, to a working class family. He lived there above a pub until he was 12 when his parents separated and he moved to [[Blackburn]].&lt;ref name="Times"&gt;{{cite news|last=Maxwell|first=Dominic|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/stage/comedy/article2908965.ece|title=Mack on the Attack|work=[[The Times]] magazine|date=24 November 2007|accessdate=8 February 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SundayTimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/article408576.ece|title=Comedy: This stand-up's got legs |accessdate=29 December 2007|author=Armstrong, Stephen|work=[[The Sunday Times]]|date= 9 January 2005 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went to Birkdale Primary Junior School (Bury Road), [[Stanley High School (Southport)|Stanley High School]] in Southport and Everton High School in Blackburn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mayoh|first1=Emma|title=Comedian Lee Mack confesses Southport fear|url=http://www.lancashirelife.co.uk/people/celebrity-interviews/comedian-lee-mack-confesses-southport-fear-1-1637867|accessdate=23 January 2018|work=Lancashire Life|date=5 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/leisure/tv/8771262.Return_of_the_Mack_as_Not_Going_Out_returns/|title=Return of the Mack as Not Going Out returns|newspaper=Lancashire Telegraph|publisher=Newsquest (North West)|date=5 January 2011|accessdate=22 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon leaving school, Mack worked in a bingo hall and as a stable boy. After working at the stable of racehorse trainer [[Ginger McCain]] in Southport for three days, he asked if he could ride one of the horses, to which the trainer agreed. Without realising, Mack then chose [[Red Rum]] as the first horse he would ride.&lt;ref name="Times"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The 10 most surprising truths on Would I Lie to You|newspaper=[[Radio Times]] |date=9 September 2016 |url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2016-09-09/the-10-most-surprising-truths-on-would-i-lie-to-you |accessdate=2 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mack then became a Blue Coat entertainer at the [[Pontins]] holiday resort at [[Hemsby]] in Norfolk. After appearing on stage drunk one night, and calling an audience member an offensive name, he was sacked, and then worked for six months at Pontins in [[Morecambe]].&lt;ref name="Times"/&gt;

Mack went on to have various other jobs, and performed his first "open mic" slot in 1994, while studying at [[Brunel University]] from where he graduated with a degree in drama.&lt;ref&gt;Mack, Lee (2012). ''Mack The Life'', Bantam Press.  {{ISBN|0593069420}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Within 18 months he was a full-time comedian.&lt;ref name="Times"/&gt;

==Career==
Mack first came to prominence by winning ''[[So You Think You're Funny]]'' at the 1995 [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]]. Since then, Mack has played the part of Graham, the security guard in the original radio version of ''[[The Mighty Boosh]]'', and also has his own radio show on [[BBC Radio 2]] called ''The Lee Mack Show'', which features  varying celebrities co-hosting the show.

===Television===
Mack was a cast member for ITV's ''[[The Sketch Show]]''&lt;ref name="Times"/&gt; and featured in the American version of the same name.

In 2005, Mack presented ''[[They Think It's All Over (TV series)|They Think It's All Over]]'', a sports based comedy panel game, formerly presented by [[Nick Hancock]].&lt;ref name="Times"/&gt; However, it proved to be the show's final series.&lt;ref name="Times"/&gt; In 2007 he appeared on ''[[TV Heaven, Telly Hell]]''.

His first sitcom ''[[Not Going Out]]'' for [[BBC One]] with [[Tim Vine]] (in which he plays Lee, the central character) premiered on 6 October 2006. The show has since returned for eight more series, the most recent airing in 2018. The show has won a [[Rose d'Or]] and [[Royal Television Society|RTS Award]].

Since 2007, Mack has been a team captain on the [[BBC One]] comedy panel show ''[[Would I Lie to You? (TV series)|Would I Lie to You?]]''.&lt;ref name="Times"/&gt; He has also been guest host on ''[[Have I Got News for You]]'' six times: 23 May 2008, 12 June 2009, 1 April 2010, 2 December 2010, 28 October 2011, and 20 April 2018. He has twice been guest host on ''[[Never Mind the Buzzcocks]]''; 9 December 2010 and 22 October 2012.

Mack has contributed to [[Comic Relief]] and has appeared on ''[[Live at the Apollo (TV series)|Jack Dee Live at the Apollo]]''.

In June 2011, he launched a new show entitled ''[[Lee Mack's All Star Cast]]'' for [[BBC One]]. It features members of the audience taking part in silly games to get a spot in a sketch at the end of the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lee Mack and Penn &amp; Teller ratings soar as Marriage Ref fails to impress|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/tv/866806-lee-mack-and-penn-teller-ratings-soar-as-marriage-ref-fails-to-impress|accessdate=14 November 2011|newspaper=Metro|date=19 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2012, Mack was one of the compères at the Queen's Diamond Jubilee Concert outside [[Buckingham Palace]] in [[London]].

In March 2013, Mack appeared on the panel on an episode of ''[[Let's Dance for Comic Relief]]''  with [[Arlene Phillips]] and [[Greg James]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lets Dance for Comic Relief - Series 5 - Episode 3 |url=http://www.radiotimes.com/episode/vhx4w/lets-dance-for-comic-relief--series-5---episode-3 |publisher=www.radiotimes.com | accessdate=2 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since February 2014, he has presented ''[[Duck Quacks Don't Echo]]'', a comedy-based panel show for [[Sky1]].

===Live tours===
Mack went on tour in 2006 and filmed his first live DVD at the [[Bloomsbury Theatre]], which was released the following year. In spring 2010 Mack embarked on his "Going Out" tour. Extra dates were added for autumn 2010 due to his spring tour being sold out well in advance. ''Going Out Live'', his second live DVD, was filmed at the [[Hammersmith Apollo]] and was released in November. In December 2010 he performed at the [[Royal Variety Performance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Simon|first=Jane|title=Royal Variety Performance|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv-entertainment/tv/todays-tv/2010/12/16/royal-variety-the-spice-of-life-115875-22786278/|accessdate=14 November 2011|newspaper=Daily Mirror|date=16 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Mack has been married since 2005. He and his wife live in [[Surrey]] and have three children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/you/article-2092152/Q-A-comedian-Lee-Mack.html|title=Q and A with comedian Lee Mack|publisher=Daily Mail|date=29 January 2012|accessdate=8 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2009, along with other British entertainers, Mack signed an open letter to ''[[The Times]]'' on the [[Bahá'í]] leaders then on trial in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Stand up for Iran’s Baha’is - Voices from the arts call for the imprisoned Baha'i leaders in Iran to receive a fair trial | newspaper = The Times | pages = | date = 2009-02-26 | url =http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/letters/article5804284.ece | location=London | accessdate=7 May 2010 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mack said in an interview with ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/jan/31/family-values-lee-mack | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=My family values | first=Michelle | last=Hodgson | date=31 January 2009 | accessdate=7 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; that his first foray into comedy was doing [[Bobby Ball]] impressions at his school when he was 15. Mack is a keen supporter of [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] and occasionally visits [[Ewood Park]] to watch games.&lt;ref name=letrovers&gt;{{cite news|last1=Clough|first1=Dan|title=East Lancs comedian Lee Mack in hunt for old Blackburn pub sign|url=http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/news/11149022.East_Lancs_comedian_Lee_Mack_in_hunt_for_old_Blackburn_pub_sign/|accessdate=20 November 2014|work=[[Lancashire Telegraph]]|publisher=[[Newsquest Media Group]]|date=15 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At one point, Mack shared a flat with [[Noel Fielding]]. In July 2012, Mack received an honorary doctorate from [[Brunel University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.brunel.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/news-items/ne_202587 |title=Comedian Lee Mack awarded honorary degree by Brunel University |date=27 July 2012 |publisher=[[Brunel University London]] |accessdate=10 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303224342/http://www.brunel.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/news-items/ne_202587 |archivedate=3 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He published his autobiography ''Mack the Life'' ({{isbn|0-552-16655-3}}) in the same year.

In  2012, Mack was diagnosed with [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]].&lt;ref name="herefordtimes"&gt;{{cite news| last=Rogers|first=Paul|url=http://www.herefordtimes.com/news/10452555.Lee_Mack_stars_at_Hay_Festival/?ref=rss|title=Lee Mack stars at Hay Festival|work= |location=Hereford|publisher=''[[Hereford Times]]''|date=30 May 2013|accessdate=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mack is a [[darts]] fan and regularly plays with his friend [[Tim Vine]]. Both men appeared on the debut series of ''[[Let's Play Darts]]'', facing each other in the final, with Mack and his partner [[Martin Adams]] beating Vine and his partner [[Darryl Fitton]]. He currently holds the [[Guinness World Records]] title for the most darts number twos in one minute. On the same day, he also broke the record for the most darts in inner and outer bullseyes in one minute, a title which he held for a year and two months before it was broken on {{date|2016-09-23}} by professional darts player [[James Wade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Most darts in inner and outer bullseyes in one minute | website=Guinness World Records | date=17 July 2015 | url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/most-darts-in-inner-and-outer-bullseyes-in-one-minute | accessdate=16 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Most darts number twos in one minute | website=Guinness World Records | date=17 July 2015 | url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/391385-most-darts-number-twos-in-one-minute | accessdate=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mack is not the first person in his family to have performed comedy. He reveals in the 2018 series of ''[[Who Do You Think You Are? (UK TV series)|Who Do You Think You Are?]]'' that his great grandfather was a jobbing comic and used the stage name Billy Mack. By using the index of birth records from [[General Register Office for England and Wales|General Register Office]] (GRO) researchers obtained the details needed to order the birth certificate that confirms Mack's great-grandfather had been registered at birth as William Alexander McKillop. It was also revealed that his grandfather Joe was born in Southport but was brought to Ireland as a baby and brought up by his grandparents in [[Ballina, County Mayo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=TheGenealogist featured article: Lee Mack |url=https://www.thegenealogist.co.uk/featuredarticles/2018/who-do-you-think-you-are/lee-mack-871/ |website=TheGenealogist |accessdate=13 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
