Retrieved on 16 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
Sharma was nominated for the ''[[Swachh Bharat Abhiyan]]'' by the Indian Prime Minister [[Narendra Modi]] for which he campaigned and regularly promotes on his show.&lt;ref name="timesofindia1"/&gt;

===Twitter controversy===
On 9 September 2016, Sharma tweeted and tagged the Prime Minister [[Narendra Modi]], that he was asked to pay to someone at the [[Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation]] (BMC) for making his office even though he was paying large amount in taxes. Sharma did not name anybody in this case, nor did he lodge a complaint with BMC. Responding to his tweet the Chief Minister [[Devendra Fadnavis]], asked him to furnish all information to enable them to take strict action.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Thereafter, the BMC started gathering evidence against him related to illegal activities in his Oshiwara office and Goregaon apartment. The Oshiwara police also registered a case against Sharma and builder Dev Land and Housing Private Ltd (DLH). The FIR was registered by BMC’s P South Ward sub-engineer Abhay Jagtap. However, Sharma had claimed in the HC that the building was constructed as per the sanctioned plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://m.mid-day.com/amp/articles/kapil-sharma-to-get-personal-hearing-from-bmc-mumbai-news-illegal-construction/18103174|title=Illegal constructions: Kapil Sharma to get personal hearing from BMC|accessdate=26 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet again in 2018 Kapil Sharma has been on an abusive Twitter rant since April 6, Friday. A few of the tweets had abusive language in Hindi. Some were also targeted at a journalist "who only spread(s) negativity about me for very little money", later he claimed that his twitter account was hacked.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://m.mid-day.com/amp/articles/kapil-sharma-on-offensive-tweets-my-account-was-hacked/19291196|title=Kapil Sharma On Offensive Tweets: My Account Was Hacked|last=|first=|date=|website=Mid-day|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also abused a senior journalist over the phone, following which, the journalist shared that call recording on social media. This got Kapil fuming with anger and he lodged a complaint against the journalist and his previous show, The Kapil Sharma Show's producers, Preeti and Neeti Simoes. He has accused them of extorting Rs 25 lacs from him and in a bid of failing to fulfill the requirement; he has allegedly accused them of tarnishing their image on digital media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://m.mid-day.com/amp/articles/preeti-simoes-on-kapil-sharmas-complaint-i-think-he-is-suicidal-and-i-am-scared-for-him/19294171|title=Preeti Simoes On Kapil Sharma's Complaint: I Think He Is Suicidal And I Am Scared For Him|last=|first=|date=|website=Mid-day|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brawl with Sunil Grover===
In March 2017, during their return flight from [[Melbourne]], when [[Sunil Grover]], his co-actor, tried to intervene, Sharma had reportedly used some offensive words. When the controversy gathered media attention, he posted on his Facebook page to explain the events also apologizing to Grover for his actions on his Twitter handle. Grover, however, took offense and posted a message advising Sharma to handle his fame better and respect his co-actors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/kapil-sharmas-fight-with-sunil-grover- March 2017|title=Kapil Sharma apologises to Sunil Grover on Twitter|last=|first=|date=21 March 2017|access-date=|work=Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mathew|first1=Suresh|title=Now Kapil Sharma Responds to Sunil Grover’s Angry Tweet|url=https://www.thequint.com/bollywood/2017/03/21/sunil-grover-tweets-against-kapil-sharma-asks-him-to-stop-acting-like-he-is-god|website=The Quint|accessdate=22 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nobody explained what really happened during the flight with overly exaggerated media reports doing rounds. Subsequently, Grover, along with [[Ali Asgar (actor)|Ali Asgar]], [[Chandan Prabhakar]], [[Sugandha Mishra]] quit ''The Kapil Sharma Show''. However, [[Chandan Prabhakar]] returned after few weeks. Later on during the trailer launch of his movie, Sharma opened up about the event and told what really happened brushing away the exaggerated media reports and speculations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/tv/kapil-sharma-says-he-never-fought-with-sunil-grover-my-fight-was-with-chandan-prabhakar/story-ovfT086NgkG5wjS13lrdqJ.html|title=Kapil Sharma says he never fought with Sunil Grover: My fight was with Chandan Prabhakar|date=2017-10-24|work=hindustantimes.com/|access-date=2017-12-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
