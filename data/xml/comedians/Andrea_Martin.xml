==Career==
Soon after graduating from [[Emerson College]], Martin won a role in a touring company of ''[[You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown]]''. After frequent visits to Toronto, she relocated from New York City to Toronto in 1970 and immediately found steady work in television, film, and theater.

In 1972, Martin played the character of Robin in a Toronto production of ''[[Godspell]]'', with a company that included future stars [[Gilda Radner]], [[Martin Short]], [[Eugene Levy]], [[Victor Garber]], and musical director [[Paul Shaffer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ovrtur.com/production/2898216/] http://www.ovrtur.com, accessed August 16, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Two of her early film appearances were in 1973's ''[[Cannibal Girls]]'' for which she won the [[Sitges Film Festival]] Award for Best Actress, and, in 1974, as the bookish [[Fraternities and sororities|sorority sister]] Phyllis in ''[[Black Christmas (1974 film)|Black Christmas]]'', a Canadian slasher film.

In 1976, she joined then-unknowns [[John Candy]], [[Dave Thomas (actor)|Dave Thomas]], [[Eugene Levy]], [[Catherine O'Hara]], [[Harold Ramis]] and [[Joe Flaherty]] on the Canadian [[sketch comedy]] [[television series]], ''[[Second City Television|SCTV]]'', which was set at fictional television station "Second City Television", or SCTV, in Melonville. Martin most notably portrayed leopard-print-wearing station manager [[Edith Prickley]], whose dealings with the staff, including president/owner Guy Caballero, clueless newscaster Earl Camembert, and washed-up actor Johnny LaRue, helped to provide much of the show's humor. Other notable characters Martin played included incomprehensible European immigrant Pirini Scleroso, organ saleswoman Edna Boil, feminist TV show host Libby Wolfson, and children's entertainer Mrs. Falbo. Her talent for impersonation was key in her humorous portrayals of [[Barbra Streisand]], [[Ethel Merman]], [[Arlene Francis]], [[Pauline Kael]], [[Sally Field]], [[Sophia Loren]], [[Beverly Sills]], [[Lynn Redgrave]], [[Linda Lavin]], [[Bernadette Peters]], [[Liza Minnelli]], [[Connie Francis]], [[Mother Teresa]], [[Joni Mitchell]], [[Alice B. Toklas]], [[Patti Smith]], [[Brenda Vaccaro]] and [[Indira Gandhi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sctvguide.ca/characters/index.htm#martin "Andrea Martin Characters and Impersonations"] sctvguide.ca; accessed August 31, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, Martin was [[Emmy]]-nominated for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Variety Show for her work in [[Second City Television|''SCTV'']].

Her 1970's stage work eventually included the Toronto branch of the [[improvisational comedy]] troupe [[The Second City]], a group which produced almost the entire cast of ''[[Second City Television|SCTV]]''. In 1992, she made her [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] debut in the musical ''[[My Favorite Year (musical)|My Favorite Year]]'', for which she won the [[Tony Award]], [[Theatre World Award]], and [[Drama Desk Award]] for Best Featured Actress in a Musical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/article/PIPPINs-Andrea-Martin-Wins-Best-Featured-Actress-Musical-20130609 |title=PIPPIN's Andrea Martin Wins Best Featured Actress, Musical |publisher=BroadwayWorld |date=June 9, 2013 |access-date=March 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional Broadway credits include ''[[Candide]]'' (1997) and ''[[Oklahoma!]]'' (2002), and the Broadway premiere of ''[[Young Frankenstein (musical)|Young Frankenstein]]'' (2007), all of which brought her [[Tony Award]] nominations for Best Featured Actress in a Musical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/article/Andrea-Martin-Billy-Porter-Victoria-Clark-More-to-Present-at-64th-Outer-Critics-Circle-Awards-522-20140428 |title=PIPPIN's Andrea Martin Wins Best Featured Actress, Musical |publisher=BroadwayWorld |date=April 28, 2014 |access-date=March 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin starred alongside [[Geoffrey Rush]] and [[Susan Sarandon]] in the Broadway revival of ''[[Exit the King]]''. For her performance as Juliette, she was nominated for a [[Drama Desk]] and [[Outer Critics Circle Award]]. She wrote and performed in the critically acclaimed one-woman show ''Nude, Nude, Totally Nude'' in Los Angeles and New York City,&lt;ref&gt;Brantley, Ben.[http://theater.nytimes.com/mem/theater/treview.html?res=9d00e7dd1339f936a35757c0a960958260 "Theater Review;Overly Fond of Food and Doris Day, for Starters"]''The New York Times'', April 5, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; receiving a 1996 [[Drama Desk Award]] for Outstanding One Person Show.

Other theater credits include the leads in ''[[The Rose Tattoo]]'' and ''[[Betty's Summer Vacation]]'', for which she won the Elliot Norton Award for Best Actress, both produced at The Huntington Theatre in Boston. During the winter of 2012–2013, she played Berthe, Pippin's grandmother, in the [[American Repertory Theater]] production of ''[[Pippin (musical)|Pippin]]'' in Cambridge, Massachusetts, singing the classic song "No Time At All".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boston.com/ae/theater-arts/2012/12/21/pippin-back-and-surrounded-broadway-buzz/eeJ34xMmPmihTNX6Uc729I/story.html ''Pippin''] boston.com&lt;/ref&gt; The show transferred to Broadway at the [[Music Box Theatre]] and opened in April 2013. For ''Pippin'' Martin won the [[Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Featured Actress in a Musical]], the [[Outer Critics Circle Award for Best Featured Actress in a Musical]] and the [[Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Musical]]. Martin's last performance as Berthe in the Broadway production of ''Pippin'' was on September 22, 2013. She appeared on Broadway in the new play written and directed by [[James Lapine]], ''[[Act One (play)|Act One]]'', for which she received the [[Outer Critics Circle Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.playbill.com/article/64th-annual-outer-critics-circle-award-winners-announced-gentlemans-guide-wins-four-awards-com-218223 |title=64th Annual Outer Critics Circle Award Winners Announced; Gentleman's Guide Wins Four Awards |publisher=Playbill.com |date=May 12, 2014 |access-date=March 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/race/tonys-who-should-win-who-707532 |title=Tonys: Who Should Win, Who Will Win (Analysis) |publisher=Hollywood Reporter |date=June 2, 2014 |access-date=March 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin has played [[Wanda the Word Fairy]] in numerous short segments on ''[[Sesame Street]]''. She also appeared on ''[[Kate &amp; Allie]]'' as the executive producer of a low-rated cable channel, which was spun-off into her own CBS series, ''Roxie''. ''[[Star Trek]]'' fans may recognize her as one of two actresses to play [[Ishka]], [[Quark (Star Trek)|Quark]]'s iconoclastic mother on ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]''. For her role, she was made up to appear as an older woman, although in reality, Martin is less than three years older than [[Armin Shimerman]], who played Quark.

She has won two [[Emmy Awards]] for Outstanding Writing in a Variety or Music Program in 1982 and 1983. She has done considerable voice work in such animated film and television productions such as ''[[Anastasia (1997 film)|Anastasia]]'', ''[[The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius]]'', ''[[The Grim Adventures Of Billy And Mandy|The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy]]'', ''[[Rugrats]]'' as Aunt Miriam, ''[[The Secret of NIMH 2: Timmy to the Rescue]]'' as Muriel - Floyd's Wife, ''[[The Simpsons]]'' (as [[Apu Nahasapeemapetilon|Apu]]'s mother), ''[[Recess (TV series)|Recess]]'' as Lunchlady Harriet, [[The New Woody Woodpecker Show|the 1999 version of ''The Woody Woodpecker Show'']], ''[[Earthworm Jim (TV series)|Earthworm Jim]]'', ''[[Kim Possible]]'', ''[[The Buzz On Maggie]]'', ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'', and ''[[Brother Bear 2]]''.

It premiered August 5, 2015.  She played Prudy Pingleton on ''[[Hairspray Live!]]'', which aired on December 7, 2016.
