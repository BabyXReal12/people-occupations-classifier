Her jobs have included busing tables at an [[IHOP]] and working as a [[bicycle messenger]].

== Career ==

Poundstone started doing stand-up comedy at open-mic nights in [[Boston]] in 1979. In the early 1980s, she traveled across the United States by Greyhound bus, stopping in at open-mic nights at comedy clubs en route. She stayed in [[San Francisco]], where she became known for improvisational sets at Holy City Zoo and The Other Cafe comedy club in the [[Haight-Ashbury]].

In 1984, [[Robin Williams]] saw her act and encouraged her to move to Los Angeles. She performed her act when Williams hosted an episode of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Dale|last=Roe|url=http://www.austin360.com/entertainment/paula-poundstone-talks-crowd-work-robin-williams/cGcKxGhdbO8U0idW0Cg8DK/amp.html|title=Paula Poundstone talks crowd work, Robin Williams|website=[[austin360.com]]|publisher=[[Gatehouse Media]]|location=Austin, Texas|date=August 21, 2014|accessdate=July 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year, Poundstone was cast in the movie ''[[Hyperspace (film)|Gremloids]]''. She continued as a comedian and began appearing on several talk shows. In 1989, she won the [[American Comedy Award]] for "Best Female Stand-Up Comic".

In 1990, she wrote and starred in an [[HBO]] special called ''Cats, Cops and Stuff,'' for which she won a [[CableACE Award]], making her the first woman to win the ACE for best Standup Comedy Special. She went on to another first with her second HBO stand-up special, ''Paula Poundstone Goes to Harvard,'' taped on campus in [[Sanders Theatre]]. Poundstone had her own [[Bravo (US TV channel)|Bravo]] special in 2006 as part of their three-part ''Funny Girls'' series, along with [[Caroline Rhea]] and [[Joan Rivers]], titled ''Paula Poundstone: Look What the Cat Dragged In.''

Poundstone worked as a political correspondent for ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' during the [[U.S. presidential election, 1992|1992 US Presidential campaign]] and did field pieces for ''[[The Rosie O'Donnell Show]]'' in 1996. In 1993, Poundstone won a second CableACE Award for "Best Program Interviewer" for her HBO series ''The Paula Poundstone Show.''  She was then featured in her own variety show, ''The Paula Poundstone Show,'' on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] (which lasted two episodes). She also appeared on ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'' and was a regular panelist for the remake of ''[[To Tell the Truth]]''. Poundstone had a recurring role in [[Cybill Shepherd]]'s TV series, ''[[Cybill]]'' (1997). 

Poundstone has also worked as a [[Voice actor|voice actress]]. She voiced Judge Stone on ''[[Science Court]]'' (also known as ''Squigglevision''), an [[edutainment]] cartoon series done in the [[Squigglevision]] style that aired on Saturday mornings, on [[ABC Kids (US)|ABC Kids]] in 1997. 

Staying with the makers of ''Science Court'', [[Soup2Nuts|Tom Snyder Productions]], she was the voice of the mom, Paula Small, in the cartoon series ''[[Home Movies (cartoon series)|Home Movies]]'' for the show's first five episodes, which aired on [[UPN]]. Between the show's 1999 UPN cancellation and 2000 revival on [[Cartoon Network]], Poundstone chose to leave the show. The show's character, Paula Small, was named and loosely modeled around Poundstone.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

Poundstone is a frequent panelist on National Public Radio (NPR)'s weekly news quiz show, ''[[Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/programs/waitwait/|title=Programs: Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me!|accessdate=2009-01-26|website=NPR}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, she launched a new science-comedy-interview program on NPR called ''Live from the Poundstone Institute'' that released episodes weekly, then stopped suddenly, saying “the semester is over”. It is unclear whether new episodes will be released. 

Poundstone tours the country extensively, performing stand-up comedy in theaters and performing arts centers. She is known for never doing the same act twice and spontaneously interacting with the crowd. Writes Nick Zaino III of the ''[[Boston Globe]],'' "Her crowd work has always been unusual—her natural disposition, curious and ever-perplexed, allows Poundstone to aggressively question audience members without ever seeming threatening. And no one does the callback better." She has released three comedy CDs - ''I Heart Jokes: Paula Tells Them in Boston''  on [[April Fools' Day]] 2013&lt;ref name=PP&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.paulapoundstone.com |title=PaulaPoundstone.com |website=The Official Website of Paula Poundstone}}&lt;/ref&gt; North By Northwest her first double album in June 2016 recorded in Wisconsin and Oregon in 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://highbridgeaudio.com/northbynorthwest.html|title=highbridgeaudio.com|website=Highbridge Audio}}&lt;/ref&gt; and  ''I Heart Jokes: Paula Tells Them in Maine'' (2009).&lt;ref name=PP /&gt;

Poundstone's first book, ''There Is Nothing in This Book That I Meant to Say'', was published by [[Crown Publishing Group|Crown]] in 2006. Her second book, published by [[Workman Publishing Company|Algonquin]] in May 2017, is titled ''The Totally Unscientific Study of the Search for Human Happiness.'' She also wrote the column, ''Hey, Paula!'', for ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]'' (1993–1998), and articles for ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'', ''[[Glamour (magazine)|Glamour]]'', and ''Entertainment Weekly,'' among others. 

An avid reader, Poundstone has been the National Spokesperson for the [[American Library Association]]'s "United for Libraries" since 2007. It is a citizens' support group that works to raise funds and awareness for their local libraries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ala.org/united/about/news/poundstone|title=United for Libraries Forms National Partnership with Paula Poundstone|date=2 July 2009|website=ala.org|accessdate=10 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2001, Poundstone was charged with felony [[child endangerment]] in connection with driving while intoxicated with children in the car. She was also charged with three counts of lewd acts upon a girl younger than 14.&lt;ref name="LA Times"&gt;{{cite news|first=Anna|last=Gorman|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/sep/13/local/me-45143 |title=Paula Poundstone's Plea Deal Ends Child Abuse Case|work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |publisher=[[Tronc]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date=September 13, 2001|accessdate=November 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She changed her earlier plea of not guilty, and, in exchange, prosecutors dropped three counts of committing lewd acts against a child and added a [[misdemeanor]] count of inflicting injury upon a child.&lt;ref name="LA Times"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Weinraub"&gt;{{cite news|first=Bernard|last=Weinraub|authorlink=Bernard Weinraub|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/22/arts/hard-road-back-for-paula-poundstone-comic-tries-save-her-career-after-arrest.html|title=The Hard Road Back For Paula Poundstone; Comic Tries to Save Her Career After Arrest|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=New York Times Company|location=New York City|date=January 22, 2002|accessdate=July 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poundstone also pleaded [[no contest]] to one count of felony child endangerment.&lt;ref name="Weinraub"/&gt; She was sentenced to [[probation]], six months in rehabilitation, and ordered to perform 200 hours of community service.&lt;ref name="Weinraub"/&gt; In 2002, Poundstone talked about her personal responsibility for the events that led to her arrest and the steps she has taken, including a six-month treatment program for [[alcoholism]], but said that she did not commit any lewd acts or child abuse.&lt;ref name="Weinraub"/&gt;

Poundstone identifies as [[Asexuality|asexual]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Robert|last=Nesti|url=http://www.edgemedianetwork.com/entertainment/celebrities/news//148422/paula_poundstone_lives_her_life_in_her_comedy_|title=Paula Poundstone Lives Her Life In Her Comedy|website=Edge Media Network|date=August 21, 2013|accessdate=July 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as an [[atheist]].&lt;ref&gt;“I’m an atheist. The good news about atheists is that we have no mandate to convert anyone. So you’ll never find me on your doorstep on a Saturday morning with a big smile, saying, ‘Just stopped by to tell you there is no word. I brought along this little blank book I was hoping you could take a look at.’ ”[https://ffrf.org/news/day/dayitems/item/14900-paula-poundstone] —Paula Poundstone, There's Nothing in This Book That I Meant to Say, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"My family, we are atheists, and many times people have had the nerve to say to us, because this is a terrible thing to say to anybody, but they say it to me: “Where will your children get their moral guidance without religion?” And I quickly assure them that we have three seasons of “Lost in Space” on DVD [which, she says, “we use for moral and spiritual guidance.”]. So I believe we’re covered in that area."[http://freethoughtalmanac.com/?p=7604] 11 February 2011 “Q&amp;A with Paula Poundstone” by Heather Svokos&lt;/ref&gt;
