== Career ==

=== Television ===

==== Early career ====
Danson began his television career as a contract player on the daytime soap opera ''[[Somerset (TV series)|Somerset]]''. He played the role of "Tom Conway" from 1975 to 1976. He then spent a few years (1977–1982) as a doctor on the daytime soap opera [[The Doctors (1963 TV series)|''The Doctors'']]. He was also in a number of commercials, most recognizably as the "[[Estée Lauder Inc.|Aramis]] man".

He made a number of guest appearances in episodic television in the late 1970s and early 1980s, including spots on ''[[Laverne and Shirley]]'', ''[[B.J. and the Bear]]'', ''[[Family (1976 TV series)|Family]]'', ''[[Benson (TV series)|Benson]]'', ''[[Taxi (TV series)|Taxi]]'', ''[[Magnum P.I.]]'', ''[[The_Amazing_Spider-Man_(TV_series)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'', and ''[[Tucker's Witch]]''.

==== Career breakthrough: ''Cheers'' ====
[[File:Ted Danson.jpg|thumb|Danson at the 42nd Emmy Awards, September 1990]]
In 1982 Danson was cast in his most recognizable role as the womanizing former baseball player and bartender [[Sam Malone]] on the [[NBC]] sitcom ''[[Cheers]]'', wherein he has an [[Sam and Diane|on-and-off relationship]] with college-educated, sophisticated [[Diane Chambers]]. Though the show finished last in the ratings in the first season, it was well received by critics. Ratings slowly but surely improved in 1983 and by 1986 ''Cheers'' was one of the top ten shows on TV. The show had a run of 11 seasons and [[Cheers finale|its finale]] (May 20, 1993) was watched by 80 million people, becoming the [[List of most watched television broadcasts#Most watched series finales|second most watched finale]] in television history at that time. It won four Emmy Awards for Outstanding Comedy Series and a Golden Globe for Best Series – Musical or Comedy. The show ran from 1982 to 1993, with Danson receiving 11 consecutive Emmy nominations and nine Golden Globe nominations, ultimately winning two Emmys and two Golden Globes. In 2002, ''[[TV Guide]]'' named ''[[Cheers]]'' the 18th Greatest Show of All Time. It was also included in ''Time'' Magazine's 100 Greatest Shows of All Time.

Danson also appeared as [[Sam Malone]] in guest-starring roles on other sitcoms, such as ''[[Frasier]]'' (a ''Cheers'' spin-off), ''[[The Jim Henson Hour]]'' and ''[[The Simpsons]]''.

==== Later career ====
Although he was best known for his work in comedy, he also appeared in an acclaimed drama, ''[[Something About Amelia]]'', about a family devastated by the repercussions of [[incest]], which co-starred his later co-star on ''[[Damages (TV Series)|Damages]]'', [[Glenn Close]]. He won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Miniseries or Television Movie and was nominated for an Emmy Award. In 1996, three years after ''Cheers'' concluded, Danson starred in the short-lived [[CBS]] sitcom ''[[Ink (TV series)|Ink]]'' with his real-life wife [[Mary Steenburgen]]. In the same year, they starred as [[Lemuel Gulliver]] and his wife in an acclaimed television miniseries of ''[[Gulliver's Travels (miniseries)|Gulliver's Travels]]''.

Danson went on to star in the successful CBS sitcom ''[[Becker (TV series)|Becker]]'' (produced by [[Paramount Television]], which also produced ''Cheers''), which ran from 1998 to 2004. Danson also plays a fictionalized version of himself on ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]''. He reprised his role of Sam Malone in a second-season episode of ''[[Frasier]]'' and voiced him in ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[Fear of Flying (The Simpsons)|Fear of Flying]]".

In 1999 Danson was presented with a star on [[Hollywood's Walk of Fame]].

Danson returned to series television in the fall of 2006, playing a psychiatrist in the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] sitcom ''[[Help Me Help You (TV series)|Help Me Help You]]'', which was canceled at midseason due to low [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]].

In 2006 Danson received a nomination for a [[Screen Actors Guild Award]] for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a TV Movie or Miniseries for his role in ''[[Knights of the South Bronx]]''.

In 2007 Danson starred in the FX Network drama ''[[Damages (TV series)|Damages]]'' as a corrupt billionaire, Arthur Frobisher. The role earned him an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series but he lost to co-star [[Željko Ivanek]]. In the second season Danson became a recurring character instead of one of the principal cast. Nevertheless, Danson received an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series but lost to [[Michael J. Fox]] for his guest appearance in ''[[Rescue Me (U.S. TV series)|Rescue Me]]''.

In 2011 Danson appeared in the music video for "[[Make Some Noise (Beastie Boys song)|Make Some Noise]]" by the [[Beastie Boys]]. He is also mentioned in the song's lyrics.

Danson starred in the HBO sitcom ''[[Bored to Death]]'' as George Christopher, the laconic, salubrious and sometime downright infantile editor of ''Edition'' magazine. Critics often praised Danson as being the highlight of the program, calling his character a "scene stealer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=TV Weekend: Private Eye-rony; Also, Curb's Return |first=James |last=Poniewozik |authorlink=James Poniewozik |url=http://tunedin.blogs.time.com/2009/09/18/tv-weekend-private-eye-rony-also-curbs-return/ |work=[[Time (magazine)|TIME]] |date=September 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Franklin |first=Nancy |url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/television/2009/09/28/090928crte_television_franklin |title=HBO's Bored to Death review |journal=[[The New Yorker]] |date=August 1, 2011 |accessdate=February 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the cancellation of ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation]]'', it was announced that his character [[D.B. Russell]] would make a move over to the third spinoff show ''[[CSI: Cyber]]'' in the second season. The show was cancelled after two seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csifiles.com/content/2015/05/petersen-helgenberger-return-for-2-hour-csi-finale-danson-joins-csicyber/ |title=Petersen &amp; Helgenberger Return For 2-Hour 'CSI' Finale, Danson Joins 'CSI:Cyber' |work=CSI Files |accessdate=June 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 Danson appeared in the second season of the TV show loosely based on the film of the same name, ''[[Fargo (TV series)|Fargo]]''.

== Personal life ==
[[File:TedDansonMarySteenburgenDec09.jpg|thumb|right|Danson with wife Mary Steenburgen in December 2009]]
Danson and his first wife, actress Randall "Randy" Gosch (now professionally known as Randy Danson), were married in 1970 and divorced in 1975. Danson's second wife was producer Cassandra "Casey" Coates; they were married in 1977. On December 24, 1979, while giving birth to their first daughter Kate, Coates suffered a stroke, and Danson spent several years caring for her and helping her recuperate. They later adopted a second daughter, Alexis. Danson's affair with actress [[Whoopi Goldberg]] led to their divorce in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ka9YAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=g-oDAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=whoopi%20goldberg%20ted%20danson%20casey&amp;pg=6508%2C962890 |title=Ted, Whoopi rumored to have split |newspaper=[[The Register-Guard]] |location=[[Eugene, Oregon]] |page=2A |date=November 6, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of Hollywood's costliest divorces, reportedly costing Danson $30 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/celebritynews/5153802/Mel-Gibson-to-top-list-of-biggest-celebrity-divorce-payouts.html |title=Mel Gibson to top the list of biggest celebrity payouts |location=London |first=Anita |last=Singh |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=April 14, 2009 |accessdate=July 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 7, 1995, Danson married actress [[Mary Steenburgen]], whom he met on the set of the movie ''[[Pontiac Moon]]'' in 1993, and became the stepfather to Steenburgen's children, Lilly and [[Charlie McDowell|Charlie]], from her previous marriage to actor [[Malcolm McDowell]].

Danson has been a [[vegan]] multiple times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Runkle |first=Nathan |url=http://www.mfablog.org/2012/02/cheers-to-ted-danson-for-going-vegan.html |title="Cheers" to Ted Danson for Going Vegan |work=Mercy For Animals |date=5 February 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/686fEvZgW?url=http://www.mfablog.org/2012/02/cheers-to-ted-danson-for-going-vegan.html |archivedate=June 1, 2012 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latenightwithjimmyfallon.com/blogs/2009/03/tonights-guest-ted-danson/ |title=Tonights Guest Ted Danson |work=Late Night with Jimmy Fallon |date=March 27, 2007 |accessdate=July 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He currently adheres to a [[pescetarian]] diet.

=== Relationship with Whoopi Goldberg ===
While a guest on ''[[The Arsenio Hall Show]]'' in late 1988, he met actress [[Whoopi Goldberg]], whom he described as "a sexy, funny woman".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1993-05-23/features/9305230087_1_ted-danson-whoopi-goldberg-black |title=Sparks Fly As Whoopi (and Ted) Talk About Family, Race, Comedy |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=May 23, 1993 |first=Jeff |last=Hayward |accessdate=June 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two became friends, co-hosting ''Help Save Planet Earth'' in 1990, a video guide to saving the environment (Danson played himself, Goldberg played the role of [[Mother goddess|Mother Earth]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6RmLuu7fwo |title=Help Save Planet Earth [x264] [VHS] [1990] |author=Occult Demon Cassette |date=January 14, 2016 |accessdate=June 9, 2016 |via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; However while making ''Made in America'' in April 1992, the two became romantically involved—a pairing which was heavily featured in gossip tabloids such as the ''[[National Enquirer]]''. The couple also appeared on the [[Rock the Vote]] TV special that same year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.paleycenter.org/collection/item/?q=rebecca&amp;p=5&amp;item=T:29341 |title=Rock The Vote (TV) |work=The Paley Center for Media |accessdate=June 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as being set to star in a [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]]-produced version of [[Neal Barrett Jr.]]'s ''Pink Vodka Blues'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://variety.com/1993/voices/columns/nicholson-gets-big-offer-for-little-job-1117862146/ |title=Nicholson gets big offer for little job |first=Army |last=Archerd |date=March 17, 1993 |journal=Variety |accessdate=June 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; written by [[Marshall Brickman]].

Danson experienced substantial negative press attention on October 8, 1993, after his appearance in [[blackface]] at a [[New York Friars Club|Friars Club]] [[roast (comedy)|comedy roast]] in honor of Goldberg. In his monologue, Danson made extensive use of offensive racial stereotypes, used the word "[[nigger]]" more than a dozen times, and [[watermelon stereotype|ate a watermelon]], angering such guests as [[Montel Williams]] and [[Mayor of New York City|Mayor]] [[David Dinkins]].&lt;ref name="jet"&gt;{{cite journal |date=October 25, 1993 |title=Whoopi Goldberg Defends Ted Danson's Blackface Act At Friars Club Roast |journal=[[Jet (magazine)|Jet]] |volume=84 |number=26 |pages=12–14, 60–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/10/nyregion/racial-jokes-spur-apology-from-friars.html |title=Racial Jokes Spur Apology from Friars |first=Ian |last=Fisher |newspaper=New York Times |date=October 10, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldberg defended the sketch, explaining that she had helped write much of the material and referred Danson to the makeup artist who painted his face.&lt;ref name="jet2"&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qOgCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA43 |title=Whoopi, Frankly |first=Nancy Jo |last=Sales |journal=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |page=43 |date=February 17, 1997 |ISSN=0028-7369 |accessdate=February 15, 2012 |via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Danson and Goldberg issued statements emphasizing "the Friars Club tradition of raucous and over the top humor" and describing those offended as newcomers who "were uncomfortable with what to expect".&lt;ref name="jet"/&gt; Substantial excerpts from the performance were later printed in ''[[Spy (magazine)|Spy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Theroux |first=Louis |authorlink=Louis Theroux |date=February 1994 |title=The Fine Print: Danson in the Dark |journal=[[Spy (magazine)|Spy]] |pages=21–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 5, 1993, Danson and Goldberg issued a statement signalling the end of their relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20106778,00.html |title=Changing Partners |first=Shelley |last=Levitt |date=November 22, 1993 |journal=[[People (magazine)|People]] |accessdate=June 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Environmentalism ===
Danson's interest in environmental concerns was ignited when he was twelve years old and Bill Breed, then [[curator]] of geology at the [[Museum of Northern Arizona]], introduced Danson and friend Marc Gaede to a game he referred to as "billboarding". Armed with an axe and saw, Breed, Gaede, and Danson ended up destroying over 300 outdoor advertising signs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chase |first=Alston |title=In A Dark Wood |publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin]] |year=1995 |pages=xvii |isbn=0-395-60837-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Danson's interest in [[environmentalism]] continued over the years, and he began to be concerned with the state of the world's oceans. In the 1980s, he was a contributing founder of the ''American Oceans Campaigns'', which merged with [[Oceana (non-profit group)|Oceana]] in 2001, where Danson is a board member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Ted+Danson%3a+acting+for+the+oceans.-a020417682 |title=Ted Danson: acting for the oceans |journal=[[E–The Environmental Magazine]] |first=Campbell |last=Wood |date=January 1, 1998 |via=thefreelibrary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011, Danson published his first book, ''Oceana: Our Endangered Oceans And What We Can Do To Save Them'', written with journalist Michael D'Orso.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kellogg|first1=Carolyn|title=Ted Danson dives into 'Oceana'|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/apr/26/entertainment/la-et-ted-danson-20110426 |accessdate=3 December 2015 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=April 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oceana: Our Endangered Oceans and What We Can Do to Save Them|url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10228546-oceana |website=Good Reads |accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political activism ===
Danson is a friend of former United States President [[Bill Clinton]], who attended Danson and Mary Steenburgen's wedding. Danson has donated more than $85,000 to [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidates, including [[Al Gore]], [[John Edwards]], [[Barbara Boxer]], [[Bill Clinton]], [[Al Franken]], and [[John Kerry]]. He has also donated to the [[Democratic Party of Arkansas]] and the [[Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee]]. Danson and Steenburgen campaigned for Sen. [[Hillary Clinton]] during her [[Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2008|2008 Presidential campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/44/2008/02/danson-to-hit-the-road-for-cli.html |title=Danson to Hit the Road for Clinton Again |first=Juliet |last=Eilperin |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=February 15, 2008 |accessdate=July 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended the wedding of their daughter [[Chelsea Clinton|Chelsea]] on July 31, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20406677,00.html |title=Chelsea Clinton Marries Marc Mezvinsky |first=Ramin |last=Setoodeh |journal=[[People (magazine)|People]] |date=July 31, 2010 |accessdate=August 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He appeared with Steenburgen at the [[2016 Democratic National Convention]]. On October 3, 2016, he helped open the new headquarters in Lancaster at the old Queen Pharmacy on King Street for [[Hillary Clinton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lancasteronline.com/news/local/ted-danson-opens-hillary-clinton-campaign-office-in-lancaster/article_5b22a38e-89cf-11e6-885e-7781bd1a0a18.html |title=Ted Danson opens Hillary Clinton campaign office in Lancaster |first=Tim |last=Stuhldreher |work=[[Lancaster Online]] |accessdate=January 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wgal.com/news/clinton-in-pennsylvania-tuesday-surrogate-ted-danson-monday/41931532 |title=Actor Ted Danson opening Lancaster campaign office for Clinton |date=October 3, 2016 |work=[[WGAL]] News |accessdate=January 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.eveningsun.com/story/news/2016/10/02/actor-ted-danson-stump-clinton-lancaster/91450494/ |title=Actor Ted Danson to stump for Clinton in Lancaster |first=Anthony J. |last=Machcinski |date=October 2, 2016 |newspaper=Hanover Evening Sun |accessdate=January 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
