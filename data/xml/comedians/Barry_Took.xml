'''Barry Took''' (19 June 1928{{snd}}31 March 2002) was an English writer, television presenter and comedian. His decade and a half writing partnership with [[Marty Feldman]] led to the television series ''[[Bootsie and Snudge]]'' and the radio comedy ''[[Round the Horne]]'' and other projects.

He is also remembered in the UK for presenting ''[[Points of View (TV series)|Points of View]]'', a [[BBC Television]] programme featuring viewers' letters on the [[BBC]]'s output,&lt;ref name="Stevens"&gt;{{cite book

==Early life and education==
The son of a manager at the Danish Bacon Company, Took was born somewhere between the boroughs of [[Muswell Hill]]&lt;ref name=Martin&gt;{{cite news| first= Douglas |last= Martin |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/14/nyregion/barry-took-73-father-of-monty-python-dies.html |title= Barry Took, 73, Father of Monty Python, Dies| work= [[The New York Times]]| date= 14 April 2002| accessdate= 1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Wood Green]],&lt;ref name=Scotsman /&gt; [[north London]] and brought up there during the war, running away from the home in [[Wisbech]] to which he had been evacuated.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1389535/Barry-Took.html Obituary: Barry Took], telegraph.co.uk, 2 April 2002&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[Stationers' Company's School|Stationers School]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last =Gifford | first =Dennis | title =Barry Took | work =Obituary | publisher = Independent.co.uk | date =1 April 2002 | url =https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/barry-took-729876.html | accessdate =24 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but quit school at age 15.&lt;ref name=Martin /&gt; His older brother Philip would eventually work for the US Space Program before dying as a young man.&lt;ref name=Scotsman /&gt;

==Career==
With his limited education, Took found work as an office boy for a publisher and a cinema projectionist.&lt;ref name=Scotsman /&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/&gt; During his period of [[Conscription in the United Kingdom#After 1945|National Service]] in the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] in which he played the trumpet,&lt;ref name=Scotsman /&gt; he began performing and later worked as a stand-up comedian, eventually becoming a West End [[revue]] performer, working on ''[[For Amusement Only]]'' and ''[[For Adults Only (revue)|For Adults Only]]''.

In terms of his comedy writing, Took's best work was written in collaboration with [[Marty Feldman]], whom he first met in 1954.&lt;ref name="screenonline"&gt;John Oliver [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/532391/ "Took, Barry (1928–2002)"], BFI screenonline&lt;/ref&gt; The two men wrote for several television shows in the 1950s and '60s, including ''[[The Army Game]]'' and its spin-off ''[[Bootsie and Snudge]]''. He co-wrote ''[[Beyond Our Ken]]'' for two series (1958–59) with [[Eric Merriman]] for BBC Radio before leaving after a disagreement with his fellow writer. With [[Marty Feldman]] he wrote most episodes of ''[[Round the Horne]]''; the intermittent partnership between them continued until 1974.&lt;ref name="screenonline"/&gt;

In the late 1960s Took became comedy advisor to the BBC and was responsible for bringing together the performers who formed ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'', before moving to the United States to work briefly on ''[[Rowan and Martin's Laugh In]]''.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/&gt; He returned to the UK in early 1970, was involved in setting up the BBC series ''[[The Goodies (TV series)|The Goodies]]'', although he had returned to take up the position of Head of Light Entertainment at [[London Weekend Television]]. He resigned from this position when [[Stella Richman]], his superior and the Director of Programming, was dismissed.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt; ''[[On the Move (TV series)|On the Move]]'' (1975–76), a programme linked to a national campaign to promote adult literacy, was written by Took and featured [[Bob Hoskins]] and Donald Gee. He was involved in two further television series on the issue, ''Your Move'' and ''Write Away''.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1389535/Barry-Took.html| work= The Telegraph | title= Barry Took| date= 2 Apr 2002 | accessdate= 1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977 Took hosted his own comedy sketch show, ''Took and Co''. Also featuring [[Robin Bailey]], [[Chris Emmett]], [[Andrew Sachs]] and [[Gwen Taylor]], the series ran for seven episodes late at night on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]].

In 1979 he became chairman of ''[[The News Quiz]]'' on [[BBC Radio 4]], a role he filled until 1981 and again from 1986 to 1995. In the same year he became a presenter of ''[[Points of View (TV series)|Points of View]]'', staying with the programme for 7½ years.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/&gt;

Took also hosted the [[BBC Radio 2]] comedy panel game ''The Impressionists'', which included [[Peter Goodwright]], [[Roger Kitter]], [[David Jason]] and Dave Evans and, in 1998, the single-season revival of ''[[Twenty Questions]]'' titled ''Guess What?''.

He had seven books published, including his autobiography and several histories of comedy.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/&gt; He also wrote [[Kenneth Williams]]'s life story for the ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'' in 1996.&lt;ref name="Stevens"/&gt;

==Personal life and final years==
During his time with the Royal Air Force he met his first wife, Dorothy "Dot" Bird, who was serving in the [[Women's Royal Air Force]].&lt;ref name=Martin /&gt; They married in 1950&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt; and had three children (Barry, Susan and David), but were later divorced. In 1964&lt;ref name=Scotsman&gt;[http://www.scotsman.com/news/obituaries/barry-took-1-500864 "Barry Took"], ''The Scotsman'', 1 April 2002&lt;/ref&gt; he married Lynden "Lyn" Leonard, this second marriage resulting in a daughter named Elinor. The couple separated in 1999&lt;ref name="Purser"&gt;{{cite news| first= Philip |last= Purser |url= https://www.theguardian.com/media/2002/apr/01/broadcasting.guardianobituaries |title= Obituary: Barry Took| work= [[The Guardian]]| date= 1 April 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually divorced.&lt;ref name=Martin /&gt; Took went through a phase of drinking heavily.&lt;ref name= Scotsman /&gt; He also spoke publicly about his experiences with depression and undergoing extensive psychotherapy for several years.&lt;ref name=Martin /&gt;&lt;ref name= Scotsman /&gt;
