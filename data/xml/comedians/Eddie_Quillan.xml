'''Edward "Eddie" Quillan''' (March 31, 1907 &amp;ndash; July 19, 1990) was an [[United States|American]] film actor whose career began as a child on the [[vaudeville]] stages and [[silent films|silent film]] and continued through the age of television in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/25/obituaries/eddie-quillan-actor-83.html|title=Eddie Quillan, Actor, 83|last=Ap|date=1990-07-25|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-08-29|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vaudeville and silent films==
Born in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], into a family of vaudeville performers, Quillan made his stage debut at the age of seven alongside his parents, Scottish-born Joseph Quillan and his wife Sarah, as well as his siblings in their act titled 'The Rising Generation'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19900724&amp;slug=1084029|title=Living {{!}} Actor Eddie Quillan Dies; 60-Year Show-Biz Veteran {{!}} Seattle Times Newspaper|website=community.seattletimes.nwsource.com|access-date=2017-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 1920s he was called upon by film director [[Mack Sennett]] to perform a screen test for Mack Sennett Studios. Sennett signed Quillan to a contract in 1922.

Quillan's very first film appearance was in the 1922 comedy short ''[[Up and at 'Em (film)|Up and at 'Em]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=New England Vintage Film Society, Inc.|title=Playbills to Photoplays|publisher=Xlibris Corporation|year=2010|pages=224|isbn=1-4535-8773-X|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RuolkAxx1SsC&amp;pg=PA224&amp;dq=%22Up+and+at+'Em%22,+1922+film&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=-XjxTfH_H4mmsQPitP28Dg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Up%20and%20at%20'Em&amp;f=true|accessdate=June 9, 2010}}{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; His next performance was in the 1926 comedy short ''The Love Sundae'' opposite actress [[Alice Day]]. His next ten film appearances (all released in 1926) were all comedy shorts that were vehicles for Day. He would spend most of the remaining years of the 1920s in comedy shorts featuring actresses [[Ruth Taylor (actress)|Ruth Taylor]] and [[Madeline Hurlock]]. In 1928, Quillan starred in the comedy ''A Little Bit of Everything'', notable because it featured his siblings Marie, Joseph and John in starring roles. Marie Quillan would eventually embark on a film career of her own and appear opposite her brother once more, in the 1929 comedy ''Nosy Neighbors''.  
 
Quillan's first feature-length film was the 1928 comedy-drama ''Show Folks'' opposite actress [[Lina Basquette]], in which Quillan appropriately plays a vaudeville dancer.  The film was a modest success and also featured actress [[Carole Lombard]].  Quillan's breakout role (and first dramatic film role) was in the 1929 [[Cecil B. DeMille]] directed ''[[The Godless Girl]]''.  The film paired Quillan once again with Basquette and starred [[Marie Prevost]] and [[Noah Beery, Sr.]]  His subsequent exposure from the film landed him a contract with [[Pathé]] studios.

==Talkies and television==
[[File:Grapes of Wrath, The - (Original Trailer) - 09.png|thumb|270px|Quillan as 'Connie Rivers' in ''[[The Grapes of Wrath (film)|The Grapes of Wrath]]'' (1940).]]
Quillan would remain a popular leading and secondary actor throughout the [[talkie|sound film]] era and would appear in such notable films as 1935's ''[[Mutiny on the Bounty (1935 film)|Mutiny on the Bounty]]'' with [[Clark Gable]], [[Charles Laughton]], and [[Franchot Tone]], 1939's ''[[Young Mr. Lincoln]]'' opposite Henry Fonda and [[Alice Brady]],  as 'Connie Rivers' in  [[John Ford (director)|John Ford]]'s 1940 film adaptation of the [[John Steinbeck]] novel ''[[The Grapes of Wrath (film)|The Grapes of Wrath]]'' opposite [[Henry Fonda]], in 1943's ''[[Alaska Highway (film)|Alaska Highway]]'' and ''[[It Ain't Hay]]'' opposite the comedic duo [[Abbott and Costello]].

Quillan's breezy screen personality was seen in "B" musicals, comedies, and even serials during the 1940s. In 1948 [[Columbia Pictures]] producer [[Jules White]] teamed Quillan with veteran movie comic [[Wally Vernon]] for a series of comedy short subjects. White emphasized extreme physical comedy in these films, and Vernon and Quillan made a good team, enthusiastically engaging in pratfalling, kick-in-the-pants slapstick. The series ran through 1956.

Beginning in the late 1950s, Quillan began to make the transition to the medium of television and by the 1960s could be seen frequently appearing as a guest actor in such series as ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'', ''[[Petticoat Junction]]'', ''[[Perry Mason (TV series)|Perry Mason]]'', and approximately five appearances on the camp-horror comedy series ''[[The Addams Family (1964 TV series)|The Addams Family]]''.  He was a regular on the Anthony Franciosa sitcom ''[[Valentine's Day]]'' from 1964 to 1965, and from 1968 through 1971 he appeared as "Eddie Edson" on the television drama ''[[Julia (TV series)|Julia]]'' opposite actress [[Diahann Carroll]].

Through the 1950s and 1960s, Quillan continued to appear in motion pictures, but in increasingly smaller roles and often in bit parts.  One notable appearance of the era was his role of 'Sandy' in the 1954 [[Vincente Minnelli]] directed musical ''[[Brigadoon (film)|Brigadoon]]'', starring [[Gene Kelly]], [[Van Johnson]] and [[Cyd Charisse]].  Quillan also appeared in the uncredited role of 'Mr.Cassidy' in the 1969 Gene Kelly film adaptation of ''[[Hello, Dolly! (film)|Hello, Dolly!]]'', starring [[Barbra Streisand]] and [[Walter Matthau]] and featuring [[Louis Armstrong]]. Quillan appeared in ''[[My Three Sons]]'' as Mr Hewlett (1961) and also appeared on the western television adventure series ''[[The Rifleman]]'' as Angus Evans. He appeared twice in the fourth season: in “Mark's Rifle” (episode 150) and “Conflict” (episode 155).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trend-chaser.com/entertainment/secrets-of-tvs-the-rifleman-more-than-just-guns-and-good-times/64/ trend-chaser.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, Quillan made guest appearances on such varied television series as ''[[Mannix]]'', ''[[Here's Lucy]]'', ''[[Chico and the Man]]'' and ''[[Baretta]]''.  After meeting and befriending actor and director [[Michael Landon]], he played numerous bit roles in the popular television series ''[[Little House on the Prairie (TV series)|Little House on the Prairie]]''.  Quillan also performed in the Landon-directed series ''[[Highway to Heaven]]'' and ''[[Father Murphy]]'' during the 1980s. Quillan made his last television appearance in a 1987 episode of the television crime-mystery series ''[[Matlock (TV series)|Matlock]]''.

==Death==
Quillan died of [[cancer]] in [[Burbank, California]] in 1990 and was interred at the [[San Fernando Mission Cemetery]] in [[Mission Hills, Los Angeles, California|Mission Hills]], [[Los Angeles, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=6810250|title=Eddie Quillan (1907 - 1990) - Find A Grave Memorial|website=www.findagrave.com|access-date=2017-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.legacy.com/news/explore-history/died-today-in-history/article/died-july-19|title=Died July 19|last=Staff|first=Legacy.com|date=2017-07-19|work=Legacy.com|access-date=2017-08-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
