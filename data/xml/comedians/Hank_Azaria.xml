'''Henry Albert Azaria''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|z|ɛər|i|ə}} {{respell|ə|ZAIR|ee-ə}}; born April 25, 1964) is an American actor, voice actor, comedian and producer. He is known for starring in the animated television sitcom ''[[The Simpsons]]'' (1989–present), voicing [[Moe Szyslak]], [[Apu Nahasapeemapetilon]], [[Chief Wiggum]], [[Comic Book Guy]], [[Lenny and Carl#Carl Carlson|Carl Carlson]] and numerous others. After attending [[Tufts University]], Azaria joined the series with little voice acting experience, but became a regular in its [[The Simpsons (season 2)|second season]], with many of his performances on the show being based on famous actors and characters.

Along with the series, Azaria became more widely known through his live-action appearances in films, such as ''[[The Birdcage]]'' (1996), ''[[Godzilla (1998 film)|Godzilla]]'' (1998), ''[[Mystery Men]]'' (1999), ''[[America's Sweethearts]]'' (2001), ''[[Shattered Glass (film)|Shattered Glass]]'' (2003), ''[[Along Came Polly]]'' (2004), ''[[Run Fatboy Run]]'' (2007), ''[[Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian]]'' (2009), and ''[[The Smurfs (film)|The Smurfs]]'' (2011). Since 2017, he has  starred as the title character in ''[[Brockmire]]''.

He also had recurring roles on the television series ''[[Mad About You]]'' and ''[[Friends]]'', played the title character in the drama ''[[Huff (TV series)|Huff]]'' (2004–2006), and appeared in the popular stage musical ''[[Spamalot]]''. Though originally known as a comic actor, Azaria has also taken on more dramatic roles, including the TV films ''[[Tuesdays with Morrie (film)|Tuesdays With Morrie]]'' (1999) and ''[[Uprising (2001 film)|Uprising]]'' (2001). He has won six [[Emmy Award|Emmys]] and a [[Screen Actors Guild Award]]. Azaria was married to actress [[Helen Hunt]] from 1999 to 2000 and has been married to actress [[Katie Wright]] since 2007.

==Early life==
Azaria was born in [[Queens]], New York City, the son of [[Eastern Sephardim|Eastern Sephardic]] [[Jewish]] parents, Ruth (Altcheck) and Albert Azaria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/24/fashion/24books.html |title=Be It a Cabin, High-Rise or Ranch, There's No Place Like It |author=Liesl, Schillinger |work=The New York Times |date=2006-12-24 |accessdate=2007-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=October 2017}}&lt;ref name=essential&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/article/283296 |title=The essentials |accessdate=2010-06-14 |work=[[Toronto Star|The Star]] |author=Ouzounian, Richard |location=Toronto |date=2007-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; His grandparents on both sides hailed from [[Thessaloniki]], from [[Greece]]'s Spanish Jewish community established there after the [[Alhambra Decree|1492 exile]] from Spain. His family's spoken language at home was the [[Judeo-Spanish|Ladino]] language, which Azaria has described as "a strange, antiquated Spanish dialect written in Hebrew characters."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.broadway.com/buzz/11238/hank-azaria/ |title=Interviews: Hank Azaria |author=Henderson, Kathy |publisher=Broadway.com |date=2007-12-03 |accessdate=2013-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://animatedtv.about.com/od/hankazaria1/p/profazaria.htm |title=Hank Azaria |author=Basile, Nancy |accessdate=2013-06-18 |publisher=About.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513084315/http://animatedtv.about.com/od/hankazaria1/p/profazaria.htm |archivedate=2013-05-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Azaria's father ran several dress-manufacturing businesses, while his mother raised him and his two older sisters, Stephanie and Elise.&lt;ref name=freshair/&gt;&lt;ref name=godzilla/&gt;&lt;ref name=yahoo&gt;{{cite web |url=https://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800019189/bio |title=Hank Azaria |accessdate=2007-08-14 |publisher=Yahoo!}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before marrying his father, Azaria's mother had been a publicist for [[Columbia Pictures]], promoting films in Latin American countries, as she was fluent in both English and Spanish.&lt;ref name=freshair/&gt; During his childhood, Azaria would often "memorize and mimic" the scripts of the films, shows and stand-up comedy routines that he enjoyed.&lt;ref name=avclub/&gt;

Azaria attended [[The Kew-Forest School]] in Forest Hills.&lt;ref name=Worcester/&gt; He decided to become an actor after performing in a school play at the age of 16, becoming, at the expense of his academic studies, "obsessed with acting."&lt;ref name=avclub/&gt; Both of his parents loved all forms of show business, which further spurred him to become an actor.&lt;ref name=freshair/&gt; He studied drama at [[Tufts University]] from 1981 to 1985,&lt;ref name=Worcester&gt;{{cite news |title=Cartoon voice-over brings quiet fame |date=1991-10-23 |work=[[Telegram &amp; Gazette]] |first=Daniel M. |last=Kimmel |page=A11}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he met and befriended actor [[Oliver Platt]] and noted that "Oliver was a better actor than I was in college, and he really inspired me."&lt;ref name=mania/&gt; Together they both starred in various college stage productions, including ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'',&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/31/arts/television/31huff.html?pagewanted=print |title=Back Together on 'Huff,' 2 Friends Enjoy the Moment |accessdate=2007-12-31 |date=2006-03-31 |work=The New York Times |author=Steinberg, Jacques}}&lt;/ref&gt; before Azaria trained at the [[American Academy of Dramatic Arts]].&lt;ref name=essential/&gt;&lt;ref name=msn&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tv.msn.com/tv/article.aspx?news=190753&amp;mpc=2 |title=Hank Azaria: Not just a pretty voice |publisher=MSN |accessdate=2007-12-31 |date=2005-05-04 |first=Jenelle |last=Riley |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928141902/http://tv.msn.com/tv/article.aspx?news=190753&amp;mpc=2 |archivedate=September 28, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he did not expect the endeavor to be successful, Azaria decided to become a professional actor, so that later in his life, he would not regret not having tried.&lt;ref name=avclub /&gt; Azaria's first acting job was an advertisement for Italian television when he was seventeen years old.&lt;ref name=freshair /&gt; He also worked as a [[busboy]].&lt;ref name=wales /&gt; Azaria originally intended to work predominantly as a theatrical actor, and he and Platt set up their own company, named Big Theatre, although [[Harold Pinter]]'s ''[[The Dumb Waiter]]'' was the only thing they ever performed.&lt;ref name=msn /&gt; He decided that television was a better arena and offered more opportunity so, after being offered work with talent agent Harry Gold, Azaria moved to Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=avclub /&gt;&lt;ref name=msn /&gt;

==Career==

===Early career (1986–1988)===
Azaria got along with Gold, who was lukewarm about working with him, but after a woman Azaria had "worked with in New York got really furious with him because he said he'd work with me and then didn't", Gold sent him out for auditions.&lt;ref name=avclub /&gt; He made his television debut with a role in the pilot episode of the 1986 [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] comedy-drama series ''[[Joe Bash]]'', with [[Peter Boyle]].&lt;ref name=godzilla /&gt;&lt;ref name=msn /&gt; His part—a one-line role as the police officer Maldonado—was edited out before the show was broadcast, although the role secured him admission to the [[Screen Actors Guild]].&lt;ref name=avclub /&gt; Azaria appeared in the TV film ''Nitti: The Enforcer'', about the gangster [[Frank Nitti]], and appeared in the failed pilot ''Morning Maggie'' alongside [[Matthew Perry]], with whom he became good friends.&lt;ref name=avclub /&gt; He played Joe in an episode of the sitcom ''[[Family Ties]]'' in 1988 in which he had one line, and the following year he played Steve Stevenson in an episode of ''[[Growing Pains]]''.&lt;ref name=avclub&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/hank-azaria,61696/1/ |title=Random Roles – Hank Azaria |author=Harris, Will |date=2011-09-14 |accessdate=2011-09-21 |work=[[The A.V. Club]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Azaria has described his career progression as being gradual; he did not achieve overnight recognition or fame.&lt;ref name=freshair /&gt; In Los Angeles, Azaria was trained by acting coach [[Roy London]].&lt;ref name=awards /&gt; Between acting jobs he performed as a stand-up comedian,&lt;ref name=msn /&gt; and worked as a bartender for a catering firm.&lt;ref name=godzilla&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/may/20/entertainment/ca-51549 |title=He Faced the Lizard and Lived to Tell |work=Los Angeles Times |date=1998-05-20 |author=Smith, Steven |accessdate=2011-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Simpsons'' (1989–present)===
Azaria became famous for his [[Voice acting|voice]] work in the ongoing animated television series ''[[The Simpsons]]''. He joined the show having previously performed only one voice-over—as the titular animated dog in the failed [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] pilot ''Hollywood Dog'', a show he described as "sort of [[Who Framed Roger Rabbit|Roger Rabbit]]-esque, where the dog was animated, but everybody else was real."&lt;ref name=msn/&gt; The first voice he performed on ''The Simpsons'' was that of town bartender [[Moe Szyslak]], replacing [[Christopher Collins]] who had initially recorded the character's voice. Having known him from ''Hollywood Dog'', casting director [[Bonita Pietila]] called Azaria and asked him to audition for the voice of Moe.&lt;ref name=msn/&gt; At the time he was performing the role of a drug dealer in a play, utilizing a voice based on actor [[Al Pacino]]'s performance in the film ''[[Dog Day Afternoon]]''. He used the voice in his audition for ''The Simpsons'' and, at the request of the show's executive producers [[Matt Groening]] and [[Sam Simon]], made the voice more "gravelly". Groening and Simon thought the resultant voice was ideal for Moe and took Azaria over to the Fox recording studio. Before he had even seen a script, he recorded several lines of dialogue as Moe for the episode "[[Some Enchanted Evening (The Simpsons)|Some Enchanted Evening]]", [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbing]] Collins' voice.&lt;ref name=freshair&gt;{{cite interview |last=Azaria |first=Hank |interviewer=[[Terry Gross]] |title=Fresh Air |work=[[National Public Radio]] |publisher=[[WHYY-FM]] |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4679119 |location=Philadelphia |date=2004-12-06 |accessdate=2007-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=avclub/&gt;&lt;ref name=barber/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=Silverman, David |date=2001 |title=The Simpsons season 1 DVD commentary for the episode "Some Enchanted Evening" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Azaria did not expect to hear from the show again, but they continued to call him back, first to perform the voice of [[Chief Wiggum]] and then [[Apu Nahasapeemapetilon]].&lt;ref name="freshair" /&gt; He felt that, initially, "[the producers] didn't seem too pleased with what I had done...[Simon] was very exacting...[and] was kind of impatiently directing me on the ABCs of comedy. But then, much to my surprise, he would still keep having me back every week. But each week, I thought it was going to be my last week because I really didn't think I had done that well."&lt;ref name="avclub" /&gt; Nevertheless, by the show's [[The Simpsons (season 2)|second season]] he was performing multiple recurring voices and so was given a contract and made a permanent member of the main cast.&lt;ref name="freshair" /&gt; Since he joined later than the rest of the cast, Groening still considered Azaria the "new guy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=Groening, Matt |date=2001 |title=The Simpsons The Complete First Season DVD commentary for the episode "[[Some Enchanted Evening (The Simpsons)|Some Enchanted Evening]]" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to Moe, Wiggum and Apu, Azaria provides the voices of [[Comic Book Guy]], [[Lenny and Carl#Carl Carlson|Carl Carlson]], [[Cletus Spuckler]], [[Professor Frink]], Dr. [[Nick Riviera]], [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Lou|Lou]], [[Snake Jailbird]], [[Kirk Van Houten]], [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Sea Captain|the Sea Captain]], [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Superintendent Chalmers|Superintendent Chalmers]], [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Disco Stu|Disco Stu]], [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Duffman|Duffman]], [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Wiseguy|the Wiseguy]] and numerous one-time characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=McCann |first1=Jesse L. |last2=Groening |first2=Matt |title=[[The Simpsons Beyond Forever!: A Complete Guide to Our Favorite Family ...Still Continued]] |year=2002 |publisher=Harper Collins Publishers |isbn=0-06-050592-3 |pages=116 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His co-star in ''The Simpsons'', [[Nancy Cartwright]], wrote that: "The thing about Hank that I most remember is that he started out so unassuming and then, little by little, his abilities were revealed and his contributions to the show escalated. I realized Hank was going to be our breakaway star."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[My Life as a 10-Year-Old Boy]]|publisher=[[Hyperion (publisher)|Hyperion]]|year=2000|isbn=0-7868-8600-5|location=New York City|page=95|author=Cartwright, Nancy|authorlink=Nancy Cartwright}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Moe's voice is based on Al Pacino's, likewise many of Azaria's other recurring characters are based on existing sources. He took Apu's voice from the many Indian and Pakistani convenience store workers in Los Angeles that he had interacted with when he first moved to the area, and also loosely based it on [[Peter Sellers]]' character Hrundi V. Bakshi from the film ''[[The Party (1968 film)|The Party]]''.&lt;ref name="freshair" /&gt; Originally, it was thought that Apu being Indian was too offensive and stereotyped, but after Azaria's reading of the line "Hello, Mr. Homer", which the show's producers thought was hilarious, the character stayed.&lt;ref name="msn" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tvguide"&gt;{{cite news |title=Flash! 24 Simpsons Stars Reveal Themselves |date=2000-10-21 |work=[[TV Guide]] |first=Joe |last=Rhodes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Azaria, however, disputed this on ''LateNet with [[Ray Ellin]]'', claiming that Apu was always intended to be stereotypical.&lt;ref name="ellin"&gt;{{cite interview|subject=Hank Azaria |interviewer=[[Ray Ellin]] |title=Hank Azaria on LateNet with Ray Ellin |url=http://www.dailycomedy.com/joke/10559 |work=LateNet with Ray Ellin |publisher=Daily Comedy |date=2007-12-05 |accessdate=2008-04-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409175439/http://www.dailycomedy.com/joke/10559 |archivedate=2008-04-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chief Wiggum's voice was originally a parody of [[David Brinkley]], but when Azaria was told it was too slow, he switched it to that of [[Edward G. Robinson]].&lt;ref name="tvguide" /&gt; Officer Lou is based on [[Sylvester Stallone]],&lt;ref name="barber" /&gt; and Dr. Nick is "a bad [[Ricky Ricardo]] impression."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=Azaria, Hank |date=2004 |title=The Simpsons The Complete Fourth Season DVD commentary for the episode "[[Homer's Triple Bypass]]" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "[[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Wiseguy|Wise Guy]]" voice is "basically [[Charles Bronson]],"&lt;ref name="barber"&gt;{{cite video |people=Azaria, Hank |date=2004 |title=The Simpsons The Complete Fifth Season DVD commentary for the episode "[[Homer's Barbershop Quartet]]" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Carl is "a silly voice [Azaria] always did."&lt;ref name="enemy" /&gt; Two of the voices come from his time at college: Snake's is based on Azaria's old college roommate, while Comic Book Guy's voice is based on a student who lived in the room next door to Azaria and went by the name "F".&lt;ref name="barber" /&gt; Professor Frink is based on [[Jerry Lewis]]' performance in the original ''[[The Nutty Professor]]'', and the Sea Captain is based on English actor [[Robert Newton]]'s portrayal of many pirates.&lt;ref name="tvguide" /&gt; Azaria based his performance for the one-time character [[Frank Grimes (Simpsons Character)|Frank Grimes]], from the episode "[[Homer's Enemy]]", on actor [[William H. Macy]]. He counts Grimes as the hardest, most emotional performance he has ever had to give in the history of ''The Simpsons''.&lt;ref name="enemy"&gt;{{cite video |people=Azaria, Hank |date=2006 |title=The Simpsons The Complete Eighth Season DVD commentary for the episode "[[Homer's Enemy]]" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Azaria's work on the show has won him four Emmy Awards for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance|Outstanding Voice-Over Performance]], in 1998, 2001, 2003 and 2015. He was also nominated for the award in 2009 and 2010, but lost to co-star [[Dan Castellaneta]] and guest star [[Anne Hathaway]] respectively. He was nominated again in 2012.&lt;ref name="emmys"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.org/awards/awardsearch.php |title=Primetime Emmy Awards Advanced Search |publisher=Emmys.org |accessdate=2011-06-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080330160256/http://www.emmys.org/awards/awardsearch.php |archivedate=2008-03-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Azaria, with the rest of the principal cast, reprised all of his voice roles from ''The Simpsons'' for the 2007 film ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117940840.html?categoryid=14&amp;cs=1 |title=Homer going to bat in '07 |accessdate=2007-08-16 |date=2006-04-02 |first=Michael |last=Fleming |work=Variety }}&lt;/ref&gt; Azaria notes that he spends "an embarrassingly small amount of time working on ''The Simpsons.''"&lt;ref name="wales" /&gt; He works for "an hour on Thursdays when we read through the script, then four hours on Monday when we record it, and I'll pop in again once or twice."&lt;ref name="wales" /&gt; He concludes it is "the best job in the world, as far as I'm concerned."&lt;ref name="wales"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/showbiz-and-lifestyle/film-in-wales/2009/05/22/hank-azaria-s-million-dollar-voice-91466-23688517/ |title=Hank Azaria's million dollar voice |publisher=[[Media Wales]] |work=Wales Online |date=2009-05-22 |accessdate=2011-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Up until 1998, Azaria was paid $30,000 per episode. Azaria and the five other main ''The Simpsons'' voice actors were then involved in a pay dispute in which Fox threatened to replace them with new actors and went as far as preparing for the casting of new voices. However, the issue was soon resolved and from 1998 to 2004, they received $125,000 per episode. In 2004, the voice actors intentionally skipped several script [[read-through]]s, demanding they be paid $360,000 per episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/04/02/1080544690429.html |title=Simpsons actors demand bigger share |accessdate=2008-02-09 |date=2004-04-03 |first=Dan |last=Glaister |work=The Age |location=Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strike was resolved a month later,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Simpsons' Cast Goes Back To Work |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/05/01/entertainment/main615066.shtml |accessdate=2008-02-09 |date=2004-05-01 |work=[[CBS News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Azaria's pay increasing to something between $250,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Meet the Simpsons |date=2004-05-06 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|Daily Express]] |first=Peter |last=Sheridan}}&lt;/ref&gt; and $360,000 per episode.&lt;ref name="2008actors"&gt;{{cite news |first=Michael |last=Schneider |title=Still no deal for 'Simpsons' cast |work=Variety |date=2008-05-19 |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117986121.html?categoryId=14&amp;cs=1 |accessdate=2008-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, production for the [[The Simpsons (season 20)|twentieth season]] was put on hold due to new contract negotiations with the voice actors, who wanted a "healthy bump" in salary.&lt;ref name="2008actors" /&gt; The dispute was later resolved, and Azaria and the rest of the cast received their requested pay raise, approximately $400,000 per episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Simpsons cast sign new pay deal |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-06-03 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7434296.stm |accessdate=2009-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later, with Fox threatening to cancel the series unless production costs were cut, Azaria and the other cast members accepted a 30 percent pay cut, down to just over $300,000 per episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Block |first=Alex Ben |title='The Simpsons' Renewed for Two More Seasons |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/simpsons-renewed-two-more-seasons-245748 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |accessdate=October 15, 2011 |date=October 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an April 24, 2018 appearance on ''[[The Late Show with Stephen Colbert]]'', Azaria discussed his reaction to ''[[The Problem with Apu]]'', a 2017 documentary by [[Hari Kondabolu]] that examined Azaria and other white actors who had played [[South Asia|South Asian]] roles as [[Stereotypes of South Asians|stereotypes]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/25/arts/television/apu-the-simpsons.html|title=Hank Azaria Offers to Stop Voicing Apu on ‘The Simpsons’ After Criticism|last=Haag|first=Matthew|date=2018-04-25|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=2018-05-11|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the interview, Azaria described how watching the documentary had changed his perspective on the issue: "The idea that anyone, young or old, past or present, was bullied or teased based on the character of Apu, it just really makes me sad."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Azaria also offered to stop voicing the character: "I'm perfectly willing and happy to step aside, or help transition it into something new."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In response, Kondabolu tweeted his appreciation for Azaria's statement: "Thank you, @HankAzaria.

===Further career (1991–present)===

====Television series work====
With the continuing success of ''The Simpsons'', Azaria began taking on other, principally live-action, roles. He was a main cast member on the show ''[[Herman's Head]]'' (1991–1994) playing Jay Nichols, alongside ''The Simpsons'' co-star [[Yeardley Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Herman's Head |author=Mark Lewisohn |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/guide/articles/h/hermanshead_1299001449.shtml |accessdate=2007-08-16 |work=BBC |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040212000254/http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/guide/articles/h/hermanshead_1299001449.shtml |archivedate=2004-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He regularly recorded for ''The Simpsons'' and filmed ''Herman's Head'' during the same day.&lt;ref name=Worcester/&gt; Following the series' cancellation Azaria unsuccessfully auditioned for the role of [[Joey Tribbiani]], one of the lead characters in the sitcom ''[[Friends]]''.&lt;ref name=avclub/&gt; He was instead cast in the role of the scientist David, one of [[Phoebe Buffay]]'s boyfriends in the series. He appeared in the show's tenth episode "The One with the Monkey", before the character left for a research trip in [[Minsk]]. He reprised the role in the show's [[Friends (season 7)|seventh season]] (2001), before making several appearances in the [[Friends (season 9)|ninth]] (2003). This return culminates in David proposing to Phoebe; she rejects him, and David leaves the show for good.&lt;ref name=avclub/&gt;&lt;ref name=awards/&gt; From 1995 to 1999, Azaria had a recurring role in the sitcom ''[[Mad About You]]'' as Nat Ostertag, the dog walker.&lt;ref name="parents"/&gt; Azaria was nominated for the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series]] for his roles in both ''Mad About You'' (in 1998) and ''Friends'' (in 2003).&lt;ref name="emmys"/&gt; Azaria had the lead role in the short-lived sitcom ''If Not For You'' in 1995, playing record producer Craig Schaeffer.&lt;ref name=newsday&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/tv/take-5-hank-for-the-memories-1.3154858 |title=Take 5: Hank for the memories |work=Newsday |author=Edelstein, Anthony |date=2011-09-08 |accessdate=2011-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Azaria produced and starred in the sitcom ''Imagine That'' in 2002, replacing ''Emeril'' mid-season in the [[NBC]] lineup. He played Josh Miller, a comedy writer, who "transformed" each episode into a character Miller has imagined, "provid[ing] a humorous outlet for his frustrations at home and work".&lt;ref name=faces/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Funny guy Azaria gets his own show |work=[[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]] |date=2002-01-07 |first=Jill |last=Vejnoska |page=D1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=NBC yanks 'Emeril,' inserts 'Hank Azaria' – But future of replacement isn't too secure |work=[[The Deseret News]] |author=Scott D.

We had a bunch of executives sitting in the room, all agreeing that ''[[The Larry Sanders Show]]'' was our favorite thing on television, but we couldn't do it on NBC, and nor would we want to from a business standpoint; it simply wouldn't make enough money. By the time it aired, the writing was sort of on the wall, and I don't blame them at all. It was apparent it wasn't working."&lt;ref name=msn/&gt;

He starred as [[psychiatrist]] Craig "Huff" Huffstodt in the [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] drama series ''[[Huff (TV series)|Huff]]'', which ran for two seasons between 2004 and 2006, airing 24 episodes.&lt;ref name=essential/&gt;&lt;ref name=huffend/&gt; Azaria served as an executive producer on the show and directed an episode of its second season.&lt;ref name=mania&gt;{{cite news |title=Playing Huff |url=http://www.theatermania.com/content/news.cfm/story/7960 |accessdate=2007-08-15 |date=2006-03-31 |author=Brian Scott Lipton |work=Theater Mania}}&lt;/ref&gt; After reading the pilot script, he sent it to Platt, who took the role of Huff's friend Russell Tupper.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; Azaria enjoyed working on the show,&lt;ref name=mania/&gt; but struggled with the bleak subject matter and was often in dispute with its creator [[Bob Lowry (producer)|Bob Lowry]], noting that it "was tough to marry our visions all the time, [because] we both cared so much about it that neither of us were willing to let go."&lt;ref name=avclub/&gt; [[Gillian Flynn]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' called Azaria "impressively subtle" in the role,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,735661,00.html |title=Huff |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=2004-11-05 |accessdate=2011-08-01 |author=Flynn, Gillian}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[John Leonard (critic)|John Leonard]] of ''[[New York (magazine)|New York magazine]]'' said he was a "shrewd bit of casting."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/arts/tv/reviews/10261/ |title=Crazy/Dutiful |author=Leonard, John |work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |date=2005-05-21 |accessdate=2011-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show garnered seven [[Primetime Emmy Awards|Emmy]] nominations in 2005, including a nomination for Azaria for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series|Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series]].&lt;ref name="emmys"/&gt; Despite the awards, the show continually received low ratings, and Showtime chose not to commission it for a third season.&lt;ref name=huffend&gt;{{cite news|title=Showtime Stops 'Huff'-ing |url=http://www.zap2it.com/tv/news/zap-huffcancellation,0,3078116.story?coll=zap-news-headlines |accessdate=2007-08-15 |date=2006-06-23 |work=Zap2it |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012152321/http://www.zap2it.com/tv/news/zap-huffcancellation%2C0%2C3078116.story?coll=zap-news-headlines |archivedate=2007-10-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Returning to live-action television in 2011, Azaria starred in the NBC sitcom ''[[Free Agents (U.S. TV series)|Free Agents]]'', a remake of the British [[Free Agents|series of the same name]]. He played Alex Taylor, a recently divorced public relations executive "who is missing his kids and trying to keep himself together", and ends up sleeping with a co-worker ([[Kathryn Hahn]]).&lt;ref name=nbcbio&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nbc.com/free-agents/about/ |title=About the Show |publisher=[[NBC.com]] |accessdate=2011-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2011/05/13/chelsea-handler-nbc/ |title=Chelsea Handler's sitcom gets greenlight at NBC |work=Entertainment Weekly |accessdate=2011-05-14 |author=Hibberd, James |date=2011-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Azaria also served as a producer on the show.&lt;ref name=avclub/&gt; He was apprehensive about the project, disliking the lengthy schedule required of a lead actor in a single-camera series, and favoring the "sensibility" of cable shows.

====Film work====
{{Quote box
|quote="[Azaria's] appeal can best be summed up by, of all things, his hilarious cameo in the goofy comedy ''Dodgeball''. As Patches O'Houlihan, the dodgeball champion who will age into the magnificently gruff [[Rip Torn]], he delivers a pitch-perfect performance in an instructional video in which he chain-smokes, encourages a child to pick on those weaker than him, and steals the film from a cast of comedic greats. It's a wonderful, odd moment that could have failed miserably in the hands of a lesser actor, and he manages to pull it off with only seconds of dialogue. In my humble opinion, and using my limited knowledge of boxing terms: Pound for pound, Hank Azaria is the best actor working today."

Azaria made his film debut in the direct-to-video release ''[[Cool Blue]]'' (1990), as Buzz.&lt;ref name=avclub/&gt; His first theatrically released feature film appearance came the same year in ''[[Pretty Woman]]'', as a police detective.&lt;ref name=awards/&gt; His next major film role was as television producer Albert Freedman in the 1994 film ''[[Quiz Show (1994 film)|Quiz Show]]'', which was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]].&lt;ref name="parents"/&gt; In 1996, Azaria played gay Guatemalan housekeeper Agador Spartacus in the film ''[[The Birdcage]]''. For the role, which Azaria considers to be his "big break",&lt;ref name=avclub/&gt; he was nominated for the [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role]],&lt;ref name=awards/&gt; and critically branded "the most hilarious performance in the film," by Alison Macor of ''[[The Austin Chronicle]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Calendar/Film?Film=oid%3a138262 |title=The Birdcage |accessdate=2007-12-31 |first=Alison |last=Macor |date=1996-03-08 |work=The Austin Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt; while ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' wrote that he "[stole] the show."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.empireonline.com/features/remakes/default.asp?film=42 |title=Remakes That Worked: The Birdcage |work=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] |date=2010-07-16 |accessdate=2011-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the role he used a Guatemalan accent, and made himself sound as effeminate as possible. He had chosen two possible voices, an effeminate one and a tougher one. After advice from a drag queen, he chose the effeminate voice. Three weeks into production, he realized he sounded exactly like his grandmother, which aided his performance.&lt;ref name=freshair/&gt; Agador was originally going to be a single scene part, with the larger role of the housekeeper being played by [[David Alan Grier]]. With the producers fearing the racial connotations of a black actor in such a part, Azaria inherited the full role.&lt;ref name=avclub/&gt;

He appeared in numerous other films in the late 1990s, including ''[[Heat (1995 film)|Heat]]'' (1995), ''[[Grosse Pointe Blank]]'' (1997), ''[[Celebrity (film)|Celebrity]]'' (1998) and worked opposite [[Gwyneth Paltrow]], as Walter Plane, in the 1998 adaptation of ''[[Great Expectations (1998 film)|Great Expectations]]''.&lt;ref name="parents"/&gt; He played photographer Victor "Animal" Palotti in ''[[Godzilla (1998 film)|Godzilla]]'' (1998).&lt;ref name=msn/&gt;&lt;ref name=awards/&gt; ''Godzilla'' was one of Azaria's first starring roles in a [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] film. Its five-month shoot was the longest of his career to date, but he considered it a good chance to boost his profile. He noted, "I'm so used to melding into every character I play. Even people in the business think the guy who did ''Birdcage'', ''Quiz Show'' and ''Great Expectations'' are three different actors—which in a way makes me proud, but in another way is very frustrating. It's the curse and blessing of the character actor".&lt;ref name=godzilla/&gt; The shoot's physical challenges, and the film's critical failure, led Azaria to later describe it as "tough to make, and very disappointing when it came out. It was one you definitely chalk up and say, 'That was part of paying your dues, better luck next time'."&lt;ref name=avclub/&gt; In 1999, he starred in the drama ''[[Mystery, Alaska]]'' as Charles Danner, and the comedy superhero film ''[[Mystery Men]]'', as the faux-British silverware throwing expert The Blue Raja.&lt;ref name=avclub/&gt;&lt;ref name=simp/&gt; Other film roles included Hector Gorgonzolas in ''[[America's Sweethearts]]'' (2001), Claude in ''[[Along Came Polly]]'' (2004), and the young Patches O'Houlihan in ''[[DodgeBall: A True Underdog Story]]'' (2004), the latter two with [[Ben Stiller]].&lt;ref name=avclub/&gt;&lt;ref name=awards/&gt; For his role of Claude, a French scuba instructor, in ''Along Came Polly'', Azaria donned a wig and worked out extensively to get into the physical shape the part required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://movies.about.com/cs/alongcamepolly/a/pollyha011004.htm |title=Interview with ''Along Came Polly'' Co-Stars, Hank Azaria and Debra Messing |accessdate=2007-08-16 |first=Rebecca |last=Murray |work=About.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

And then I became surprised later on when I got dramatic roles. But I never went, 'OK, now it's time to get a dramatic role.'"&lt;ref name=msn/&gt; His next dramatic part was in the television film ''[[Uprising (2001 film)|Uprising]]'' in 2001. The film was based on the 1943 [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]] and Azaria played [[Mordechaj Anielewicz]], one of the revolt's leaders. Azaria was confused by his casting in ''Uprising'' and frequently asked the film's producer and director [[Jon Avnet]] why he was selected. "I know [Avnet] liked the fact I was Jewish, and he knew I could do accents well. He cast me and [[David Schwimmer]] in [''Uprising''], and we were both sort of mystified. He had some instinct that he wanted people who were more known for being funny. He never explained it satisfactorily to me; I don't understand why."&lt;ref name=msn/&gt; His parts in ''Tuesdays With Morrie'' and ''Uprising'' affected him, causing a depressive state which he countered with DVDs of the comedy series ''[[Monty Python]]''.&lt;ref name=msn/&gt; Azaria found ''Uprising'' to be "very difficult very depressing very emotionally challenging" material.&lt;ref name=faces/&gt; In 2003, Azaria played journalist [[Michael Kelly (editor)|Michael Kelly]], the former editor of ''[[The New Republic]]'', in the drama film ''[[Shattered Glass (film)|Shattered Glass]]''.

Azaria played [[Gargamel]] in the computer-animated/live-action adaptation of ''[[The Smurfs (film)|The Smurfs]]'' (2011).&lt;ref name=smurfs&gt;{{cite news |url=http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2010/03/17/hank-azaria-picks-up-gargamel-role-for-smurfs/ |title=Hank Azaria Picks Up Gargamel Role For 'Smurfs' |author=Brian Warmoth |work=MTV |date=2010-03-17 |accessdate=2010-03-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100506035453/http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2010/03/17/hank-azaria-picks-up-gargamel-role-for-smurfs |archivedate=2010-05-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Azaria wore a prosthetic nose, ears, [[buck teeth]], eyebrows and a wig, as well as shaving his head.

The producers wanted an "old, failed, Shakespearean actor" voice, but Azaria felt this would lack energy and wanted something more Eastern European. He eventually selected a voice similar to that of [[Paul Winchell]]'s from the cartoon.&lt;ref name=mw&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.movieweb.com/news/the-smurfs-take-over-sony-pictures-animation-part-1 |title=The Smurfs Take Over Sony Pictures Animation – Part 1 |publisher=MovieWeb |date=2011-07-01 |author=Gallagher, Brian |accessdate=2011-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Azaria disliked the cartoon when it first aired, and considered Gargamel too one-dimensional a character and "just this straight villain";&lt;ref name=mw/&gt; he opted to make Gargamel "more sarcastic" than in the cartoon, but "discovered that there's no way to play Gargamel without screaming your head off at certain points – ramping him up and getting him very upset over Smurfs".&lt;ref name=metro11/&gt; He interpreted him as "very lonely", adding that "he hates the Smurfs because they're such a happy family. He wants in really badly. I think he wants to be embraced as a Smurf".&lt;ref name=metro11/&gt; Azaria worked with the writers to "infuse" the script with some of his ideas about the character, "particularly with the 'married' relationship between Gargamel and [his cat] Azreal {{sic}}" which Azaria conceived.&lt;ref name=mw/&gt;

Reviewers from ''[[The San Francisco Chronicle]]'' and ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' commented on Azaria's "overacting" in the role of Gargamel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Smurfs are back with antics, lots of animated adventure |last=Hartlaub |first=Peter |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |publisher=[[Hearst Corporation]] |date=July 29, 2011 |accessdate=July 29, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60WjgGJFg?url=http://www.philly.com/philly/entertainment/movies/20110729_Smurfs_are_back_with_antics__lots_of_animated_adventure.html |archivedate=July 29, 2011 |deadurl=no |url=http://articles.philly.com/2011-07-29/news/29829691_1_papa-smurf-gargamel-movie |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.boston.com/2011-07-29/ae/29830291_1_smurfette-peyo-sofia-vergara |title=Ty Burr Says Cast Members Inject Fun Into The Smurfs |last=Burr |first=Ty |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]] |date=July 29, 2011 |accessdate=July 29, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111132604/http://articles.boston.com/2011-07-29/ae/29830291_1_smurfette-peyo-sofia-vergara |archivedate=January 11, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; More positive reaction came from Scott Bowles of ''[[USA Today]]'' called Azaria the "human standout";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/reviews/2011-07-28-smurfs_n.htm?csp=34life |title=Fans of old 'Smurfs' may feel a little blue |work=USA Today |author=Bowles, Scott |date=2011-07-28 |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Betsy Sharkey of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' felt he suffered the "greatest disservice" of the film's cast due to a poor script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/reviews/la-et-smurfs-20110729,0,1742025.story?track=rss |title=Movie review: 'The Smurfs' |work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=2011-08-06 |date=2011-07-29 |author=Sharkey, Betsy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Azaria noted in an interview with ''[[The A.V.

====Further voice work====
Azaria performed a number of voice roles in addition to ''The Simpsons'', although he noted in 2005: "I started doing other voiceovers for cartoons for a couple of years, but I didn't really love it. I was spoiled by ''The Simpsons''."&lt;ref name=msn/&gt; He voiced [[Eddie Brock|Venom/Eddie Brock]] in ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'' between 1994 and 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nbc.com/free-agents/about/bios/hank-azaria/ |title=Hank Azaria |publisher=[[NBC.com]] |accessdate=2011-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the animated feature ''[[Anastasia (1997 film)|Anastasia]]'' (1997), he voiced Bartok the bat and reprised the role in the direct-to-video prequel ''[[Bartok the Magnificent]]'' (1999).&lt;ref name=awards/&gt; For his performance in ''Anastasia'', Azaria won the [[Annie Award]] for Outstanding Individual Achievement for Voice Acting by a Male Performer in an Animated Feature Production.&lt;ref name=annie&gt;{{cite web |url=http://annieawards.org/26thwinners.html |title=Legacy: 26th Annual Annie Award Nominees and Winners (1998) |accessdate=2011-12-21 |publisher=[[Annie Awards]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517164005/http://annieawards.org/26thwinners.html |archivedate=2008-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also voiced Eric in the American dub of the series ''[[Stressed Eric]]'',&lt;ref name=newsday/&gt; Harold Zoid in the 2001 ''[[Futurama]]'' episode "[[That's Lobstertainment!]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.radiotimes.com/episode/fbkh/futurama-that%27s-lobstertainment! |title=Series 3 – 8.

Once ''The Simpsons'' was "going steadily" and Azaria had enough money to live on, he stopped working on commercials as he found them "demoralizing", feeling that he sounded sarcastic whenever he read for them. When recording the part of "Jell-O Man" for a [[Jell-O]] commercial, he was told to make the voice he offered "more likeable and friendly so that children like him." After pointing out that "Jell-O Man" was a fictional character, he left and pledged to never record for an advertisement again.&lt;ref name=freshair/&gt; However, in 2012 he voiced several insects in a commercial for the [[Chevrolet Aveo|Chevrolet Sonic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.4-traders.com/GENERAL-MOTORS-COMPANY-6873535/news/GENERAL-MOTORS-COMPANY-Chevrolet-to-Debut-Five-Ads-on-Super-Bowl-Sunday-14001918/ |title=General Motors Company : Chevrolet to Debut Five Ads on Super Bowl Sunday |date=2012-02-02 |publisher=4-traders}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Azariaspamalot.jpg|thumb|Azaria (''center'') performing in ''[[Spamalot]]'', December 2005]]
He has periodically returned to theatrical work, appearing in several productions.

Azaria starred in and co-wrote the third episode of the [[Funny or Die]] web-series ''Gamechangers'', entitled "A Legend in the Booth". He played Jim Brockmire, a legendary baseball announcer, fired for a profanity-filled breakdown live on air after discovering his wife was having an affair.

==Acting style and vocal range==
Azaria's friends refer to him as "the freakish mimic" due to his ability to copy almost anyone's voice, instantly after he has heard it. As a child he believed that everyone could do this, but later realized that it was not a common talent.&lt;ref name=freshair/&gt; Azaria can "remember every voice I hear, famous or otherwise&amp;nbsp;... they kind of remain in the memory banks, so I'm ready to trot them out."&lt;ref name=avclub/&gt; Azaria was glad to have found the "ultimate outlet" for this skill, in ''The Simpsons''.&lt;ref name=freshair/&gt; He "didn't realize it [when he joined the show], but it became like a lab for a character actor. I had to do so many voices."&lt;ref name=msn/&gt; In the early 2000s, Azaria felt he had reached the maximum number of voices he was capable of: "For the first 10 years of ''The Simpsons'', I would develop a bunch of voices. And then&amp;nbsp;... I hit a point when I was tapped out. Every noise I can make, I have made. Even characters like Gargamel, I've done. Even if it was only two or three lines, at some point I've done something similar on ''The Simpsons'', at least somewhere along the line."&lt;ref name=mw/&gt;&lt;ref name=metro11&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.metro.us/newyork/entertainment/article/852199--still-trying-to-catch-those-pesky-smurfin-smurfs |title=Still trying to catch those pesky, smurfin' Smurfs |work=Metro |publisher=[[Metro International]] |location=New York |author=Patalano, Heidi |date=2011-05-05 |accessdate=2011-07-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724083251/http://www.metro.us/newyork/entertainment/article/852199--still-trying-to-catch-those-pesky-smurfin-smurfs |archivedate=2011-07-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For many of Azaria's characters, much of their humor is derived from a "funny voice", such as ''The Birdcage'' and ''Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian''. He stated that "being funny with a funny voice is more my comfort zone, a broader character that I try to humanize, a kind of silly or wacky persona that I try to fill in," although he finds it "much easier to be someone much closer to myself", as it requires "less energy&amp;nbsp;... than playing characters that are so out there and high strung".&lt;ref name=sunday/&gt;

''The Simpsons'' creator [[Matt Groening]] has stated that Azaria possesses the ability to turn unfunny lines into some of the best in an episode,&lt;ref name=barber/&gt; while former writer [[Jay Kogen]] stated: "Just when I think I know [Azaria's] bag of tricks, he's always got a new thing he does to surprise me."&lt;ref name=msn/&gt; Throughout the run of ''The Simpsons'', Azaria has had to sing in character several times, a task which he describes as easier than singing normally.&lt;ref name=freshair/&gt; ''The Smurfs'' writer [[David N. Weiss]] says Azaria "has a beautiful treasure trove of talent", and "became what you wished you were writing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.jpost.com/ArtsAndCulture/Entertainment/Article.aspx?id=227748 |title=Blue and white all over |author=Brown, Hannah |work=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |date=2011-07-04 |accessdate=2011-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Playwright Jenelle Riley wrote in 2005 that Azaria was "by far" her favorite actor, praising his "versatility" and "tendency to take small roles that would normally fade into the background and to consistently create characters people care about", noting his roles in ''Shattered Glass'', ''Mystery, Alaska'' and especially ''[[DodgeBall: A True Underdog Story]]''.&lt;ref name=msn /&gt;

==Personal life==
In the early 1990s, Azaria was in a relationship with actress [[Julie Warner]].&lt;ref name=Worcester/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Raising the curtain on budding careers |work=USA Today |date=1991-08-30 |author=Green, Tom |page=4D}}&lt;/ref&gt; His relationship with actress [[Helen Hunt]] began in 1994; they married in a traditional Jewish ceremony at the couple's home in Southern California on July 17, 1999.&lt;ref name=divorce&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,26334,618774,00.html |title=Hunt Files for Divorce |accessdate=2007-08-16 |date=1998-06-17&lt;!--This is the date given, but as it is physically impossible for it to be correct, it is most likely a mistake--&gt; |first=Stephen M. |last=Silverman |work=People |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001001251/http://www.people.com/people/article/0,26334,618774,00.html |archivedate=2007-10-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The two had appeared together in ''Mad About You'' and "[[Dumbbell Indemnity]]", an episode of ''The Simpsons''.&lt;ref name="parents"/&gt; After a year of marriage, Azaria moved out of the couple's home,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hunt, Azaria on the Rocks |author=Don Chareunsy |url=http://www.hollywood.com/news/Hunt_Azaria_on_the_Rocks/312759 |accessdate=2007-08-16 |date=2000-08-04 |work=Hollywood.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003153355/http://www.hollywood.com/news/Hunt_Azaria_on_the_Rocks/312759 |archivedate=2012-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and after a six-month separation, Hunt filed for divorce, citing "irreconcilable differences".
