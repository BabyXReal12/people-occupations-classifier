He has played the title role in the [[BBC]] mystery drama series ''[[Jonathan Creek]]'' since 1997. He has been the only permanent panellist on the [[BBC]] panel show ''[[QI]]'' since 2003.

==Early life==
Davies was born in [[Loughton]], [[Essex]]. His childhood years were spent in [[Chingford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=On the move: Alan Davies |date=11 July 2008 |first=Garth |last=Pearce |publisher=The Sunday Times |url=http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/celebrity/article4396137.ece |accessdate=10 May 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Davies was six, his mother died from [[leukaemia]] and he was raised by his father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/moslive/article-2192469/Alan-Davies-The-pain-surfaces-single-day.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | first=Jon | last=Wilde | title='The pain surfaces every single day': How fatherhood saved Alan Davies from his demons | date=25 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Davies attended Staples Road School in Loughton and was privately educated at the independent [[Bancroft's School]] in [[Woodford Green]], where he gained eight [[GCE Ordinary Level|O-Levels]]. He then moved on to [[Loughton College of Further Education]] where he gained four more O-Levels and two [[GCE Advanced Level|A-Levels]] (Communications &amp; Theatre Studies). He graduated in Drama &amp; Theatre Studies from the [[University of Kent]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.kent.ac.uk/alumni/community/inspirational-alumni/arts-entertainment/davies-alan.html |title=Alan Davies – Alumni and Friends |work=University of Kent |year=2015 |accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1988, and was awarded an [[Honorary Doctorate]] by the university in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kent.ac.uk/stms/news/stories/2009/string.html |title='How Long is a Piece of String?'&amp;nbsp;– Faculty of Sciences |work=University of Kent |accessdate=2 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Stand-up===
Davies began performing [[stand-up comedy]] in 1988 at the [[Whitstable]] [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] Club. In 1991, he was named ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Best Young Comic. He continued touring and performing in the UK and Australia, winning the [[Edinburgh Festival]] Critics Award for Comedy in 1994. That show was released on video and audio cassette in 1995 as ''Alan Davies Live at the Lyric'' recorded at the [[Lyric Theatre (London)|Lyric Theatre]] as part of the Perrier Pick of the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe|Fringe]] season in October 1994.

A version of his show 'Urban Trauma', which ran in the West End at the [[Duchess Theatre]] and toured the UK and Australia, was shown on [[BBC One]] in 1998.

In 2012, Davies planned a new tour called "Life is Pain".&lt;ref&gt;[[The Graham Norton Show]], BBC1, 27 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  The title for this show came from a story he heard about a six-year-old girl being told off by her mother and responding "Life is pain". Davies said "This really made me laugh". The tour was broadcast on [[Dave (TV channel)|Dave]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tcs.cam.ac.uk/interviews/0020718-exclusive-interview-alan-davies-talks-about-jonathan-creek-qi-and-his-latest-stand-up-tour.html |title=Exclusive Interview: Alan Davies talks about Jonathan Creek, QI and his latest stand up tour |first=Nicholas |last=Tufnell |date=1 November 2012 |work=The Cambridge Student |accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radio and television===
[[File:Alan Davies2.jpg|thumb|upright|Alan Davies in 2000]]
In 1994 and 1995, Davies hosted ''[[Alan's Big One]]'' for three series on Radio 1 before appearing in Channel 4's spoof travel show ''One for the Road'' (made by [[Channel X]] in 1994/5). He later played the title role in ''[[Jonathan Creek]]'', as a trick-deviser for a stage magician with a side interest in solving crimes, between 1997 and 2004. ''Jonathan Creek'' won a [[BAFTA]] for Best Drama and was the show which brought Davies to mainstream attention.

On New Year's Day 2009, a special episode of ''Jonathan Creek'', "The Grinning Man", was broadcast on the BBC. Davies returned to ''Creek'' at Easter 2010 for a one-off episode, "The Judas Tree". However, the programme did return in Easter 2013 for the episode of "The Clue of the Savant's Thumb". Davies has confirmed in an interview that there will be at least three further specials.

Davies co-wrote and starred in his own radio sitcom, ''[[The Alan Davies Show]]'', in 1998. Cassettes of the show were produced and released by the BBC, with episodes broadcast on the [[digital radio]] station [[BBC7]]. He played Russell Boyd in the BBC comedy ''A Many Splintered Thing'', also in 1998 and 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/guide/articles/m/manysplinteredth_66602350.shtml |title=Comedy&amp;nbsp;— Shows A-Z Index |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=18 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070628221336/http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/guide/articles/m/manysplinteredth_66602350.shtml |archivedate=28 June 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 Davies played Robert Gossage in ''[[Bob and Rose]]'', a [[comedy drama]] about a [[gay]] man falling for a woman. He won the Best Actor award at the [[Monte Carlo TV Festival]] for his performance. He also played Jack the dog in the radio sitcom ''[[About a Dog]]''. In 2003, Davies appeared as a [[Star in a Reasonably-Priced Car]] on ''[[Top Gear (current format)|Top Gear]]'' with a time of 1:54 in wet conditions. He returned in Series 8 with 1:50.3 in dry conditions. During a period from the mid-1990s to 2002, Davies advertised for [[Abbey National]].

Davies took on a less comedic role in 2004, starring as Henry Farmer, a maverick barrister, in [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]] Sunday night drama ''[[The Brief (ITV)|The Brief]]'', for two series. Subsequent drama roles include Superintendent Mallard in ''[[Agatha Christie's Marple]]'' (ITV, 2008), as well as appearances in ''The Good Housekeeping Guide'' (BBC One, 2006), ''[[Roman Road (film)|Roman Road]]'' (ITV 2004) and ''[[Hotel Babylon]]'' (BBC One, 2008).

He argued the case for [[John Lennon]] as the greatest Briton of all time on the BBC's ''[[Great Britons]]'' series in 2002. In 2007, Davies starred in the second episode of [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s ''[[You Don't Know You're Born]]'' and on ''[[The Unbelievable Truth (radio show)|The Unbelievable Truth]]''.

He has appeared in an episode of the BBC science programme ''[[Horizon (BBC TV series)|Horizon]]'' in which Professor [[Marcus du Sautoy]] attempted to introduce him to elements of [[mathematical]] thought which was broadcast on [[BBC Two]] on 31 March 2009. He went on to appear in ''Horizon'' for a second time in November 2009, this time leading the episode&amp;nbsp;— du Sautoy also returned as a guest speaker.

On 16 May 2010, Davies appeared in "Your Sudden Death Question", an episode of the ITV detective series ''[[Lewis (TV series)|Lewis]]'', as Marcus Richard, a scamming quizmaster at a competition held in an Oxford college, at which some of the contestants are murdered. In September 2010, he began a three-part documentary series ''Alan Davies' Teenage Revolution'' ([[Channel 4]]), partly based on his autobiographical book ''My Favourite People and Me, 1978–88''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2010/sep/10/alan-davies-teenage-revolution-tv-review | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=TV review: Alan Davies' Teenage Revolution | first=Lucy | last=Mangan | date=10 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2010, a BBC  comedy series entitled ''[[Whites (TV series)|Whites]]'' starring Davies as a chef premiered.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/tv/comingup/whites/ BBC&amp;nbsp;– BBC Two Programmes&amp;nbsp;– Whites]  {{webarchive |url=https://archive.is/20120719185210/http://www.bbc.co.uk/tv/comingup/whites/ |date=19 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was however cancelled after this first series. It is believed to have been a victim of the cuts at the BBC subsequent to the reduced [[Television licensing in the United Kingdom|licence fee]] settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/news/story/00000481/bbc_axes_whites/ |title=BBC cancels Whites, the sitcom starring Alan Davies |date=1 March 2011 |work=comedy.co.uk |accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, Davies appeared as the guest on the return of the [[ABC Television|ABC TV]] conversation program ''[[A Quiet Word With&amp;nbsp;...]]''.&lt;ref name=abc-qwad&gt;{{cite web|title=A Quiet Word With Alan Davies|url=http://www.abc.net.au/tv/guide/abc1/201104/programs/AC0954H004D2011-04-02T213200.htm|work=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=31 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 Davies was also one of the judges on the ITV programme ''[[Show Me The Funny]]'', a talent contest for new and aspiring stand-up comedy performers.

In September 2012, Davies made his first appearance on [[Channel 4]]'s ''[[The Big Fat Quiz of the Year|Big Fat Quiz]]'' series, winning ''The Big Fat Quiz of the '90s'' alongside [[Phill Jupitus]].
[[File:Tom, Alan Davies, and Dom during 2014 FIFA World Cup.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The Bantams Banter presenters with Alan Davies for ITV's Brazilian Banter]]
In February 2014, Davies presented a  chat show ''[[Alan Davies Après-Ski]]'' on BBC Two, which looked at some of the highlights of the 2014 Winter Olympic Games. He also co-hosted the ''Brazilian Banter'' podcast for ITV with Tom &amp; Dom from Bantams Banter. The show was a satirical look at the 2014 FIFA World Cup hosted by Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/alan-davies-brazilian-banter/id884517400?mt=2 |title=Podcasts – Alan Davies' Brazilian Banter by ITV Sport |work=iTunes |accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2014, he has hosted ''[[The Dog Rescuers]]'' for [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] and the chat show ''[[Alan Davies: As Yet Untitled]]'' for [[Dave (channel)|Dave]].

He has been approached by Disney to provide the voice of [[Bob Godfrey]] for an animated biopic on the life of the celebrated animator.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

====''QI''====
{{main|QI}}
Davies currently appears as the permanent panellist on the BBC Two quiz game ''[[QI]]'', which was hosted by [[Stephen Fry]] from 2003 to 2015 but since his departure is now hosted by [[Sandi Toksvig]]. He also contributed "four words" to the ''QI'' book ''[[General Ignorance#Books|The Book of General Ignorance]]'' (which appear after Stephen Fry's foreword), "Will this do, Stephen?". Davies has appeared in almost every regular episode of the show, though in one episode (Episode 10 of Series D, "Divination") he appeared in only the first few minutes, in a pre-recorded scene, as he was in Paris attending [[2006 UEFA Champions League Final|the 2006]] [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] final during the actual recording.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://podcast.playbackmedia.co.uk/arsenal/201010/Alan_Davies~It%27s_Up_For_Grabs_Now_-_Oct_2010~1~04_Oct_10_-_Wed_Rather_Be_Us_Than_Them.mp3 |title=It's Up for Grabs Now, We'd Rather Be Us Than Them&amp;nbsp;– Alan Davies discusses how he missed QI to see Arsenal in Champions League Final}}&lt;/ref&gt; His chair was empty for the rest of the episode although his voice was heard during "General Ignorance". He also did not appear in the 2011 Comic Relief episode.

==Personal life==
Davies married writer Katie Maskell on 13 January 2007 after a 6-month engagement. The couple first met backstage at ''QI'' in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hoggard|first=Liz|title=Katie Davies: My life married to Alan Davies, London's funniest man|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/katie-davies-my-life-married-to-alan-davies-london-s-funniest-man-6769882.html |accessdate=14 November 2011|newspaper=Evening Standard|date=1 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Friend and comedy partner [[Bill Bailey]] was Davies's best man and delivered a speech at the ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Daisy |last=Goodwin |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,7-2363491_2,00.html |title=News and Views from The Times and Sunday Times |publisher=Times Online |date= |accessdate=18 August 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have three children.&lt;ref name="garden"/&gt;

Davies has narrated an anti-[[vivisection]] video called ''Wasted Lives''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.animalaid.org.uk/h/f/CAMPAIGNS/blog//4//?be_id=8 |title=Wasted Lives |publisher=[[Animal Aid]] |date=3 July 2006 |accessdate=18 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100917085902/http://animalaid.org.uk/h/f/CAMPAIGNS/blog//4//?be_id=8 |archivedate=17 September 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2007 ''The Times'' and ''Daily Telegraph'' reported that Davies bit the ear of a homeless man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Foster|first=Patrick|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/crime/article3037185.ece|title=Jonathan Creek actor Alan Davies 'bit tramp's ear' in tussle after friend's funeral|publisher=The Times|date=12 December 2007|accessdate=10 February 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Edwards |first=Richard |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/12/11/ndavies211.xml |title=Jonathan Creek star Davies bites tramp's ear |publisher=The Daily Telegraph |date=12 December 2007 |accessdate=12 February 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213111400/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=%2Fnews%2F2007%2F12%2F11%2Fndavies211.xml |archivedate=13 February 2008 |deadurl=no |location=London |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Davies had just left a wake at the nearby [[Groucho Club]]. He told ''The Times'' in 2009, "He wasn't a tramp. He was a raging, horrendous arsehole. He called me a cunt several times. Or if it wasn't him, it was his mate. And, yes, I went for him and, yes, I did it in what turned out to be an amusing way." Following the incident, Davies was banned from the Groucho Club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rifkind |first=Hugo |date=22 August 2009|url= http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article6798984.ece|title= Alan Davies on QI, being attacked and that tramp|work= The Times|accessdate= 23 August 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Davies is a lifelong fan and season ticket holder of [[Arsenal F.C.]]. Davies also used to host the podcast "It's Up For Grabs Now"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arsenalupforgrabs.com|title=It's Up For Grabs Now|work=arsenalupforgrabs.com|accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which took a light-hearted look at goings on at the club. He is also a vegetarian. On 18 January 2011, he began hosting the new Arsenal Podcast "[[The Tuesday Club]]" with [[Ian Stone]], Keith Dover,  [[Tayo Popoola]] and [[Skint Records]] founder [[Midfield General|Damian Harris]]. His support of Arsenal has been used as a recurring source of humour on ''QI'' in various ways, such as by assigning him a buzzer sound of a chant by fans of rival club [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]].

He is a supporter of the Labour Party. Davies said: "Social injustice is important to me," "Life isn’t about every man for himself. Life should be about co-operation and collaboration." When being interviewed regarding the broadcast of his Channel 4 sitcom [[Damned (TV series)|Damned]] which coincided with the 2016 Labour leadership election, Davies openly came out as a supporter of [[Owen Smith]]'s leadership bid - a bid which ultimately proved unsuccessful as [[Jeremy Corbyn]] was returned as Labour leader.

He is currently pursuing a [[Masters of Arts]] in [[Creative Writing]] at [[Goldsmiths College]], due to complete in September 2018.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

==Books==
Davies's first book, the autobiographical ''My Favourite People and Me, 1978–88'' was published by Michael Joseph ([[Penguin Books]]) in September 2009.&lt;ref name=penguincatalogues&gt;{{cite web|title=Michael Joseph|url=http://www.penguincatalogues.co.uk/lo/general/title.html?titleId=6669&amp;catalogueId=229|website=penguincatalogues|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502032618/http://www.penguincatalogues.co.uk/lo/general/title.html?titleId=6669&amp;catalogueId=229|archivedate=2 May 2014|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Of the memoir, Davies said he wished to "attempt to remember what I liked as a boy/youth/idiot and to work out why". The favourite people referred to in the title include [[Anton Chekhov]], [[John Belushi]], [[Barry Sheene]], [[Margaret Thatcher]] ("only for a few days" the author allows), [[John McEnroe]] and [[Starsky and Hutch]]. The book also mentions [[Arsenal F.C.]], the football team supported by Davies; he recalls as a child his mother sewing their club badge and captain's number onto his shirt, done only a year or so before she died. The paperback was published under the title ''Rebel Without A Clue: How the 80s Made Me''.
