==Career==

===Early career===
Henry's first manager was [[Robert Luff]], who signed him in 1975 and gave him the opportunity to perform as part of the Luff-produced touring stage version of ''[[The Black and White Minstrel Show]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/4788794/Robert-Luff.html|title=Robert Luff (obituary)|accessdate=1 March 2009|date=23 February 2009|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|location=London, England}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2009, Lenny Henry stated he was contractually obliged to perform and regretted his part in the show.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8156190.stm Five Minutes With: Lenny Henry]. BBC News, 18 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

His earliest television appearance was on the ''[[New Faces]]'' talent show, which he won in 1975 with an impersonation of [[Stevie Wonder]].&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite news|last=Iley|first=Chrissy|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/comedy/8157309/Lenny-Henry-interview.html|title=Lenny Henry interview|accessdate=4 March 2011|date=30 November 2010|location=London|work=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year he appeared with [[Norman Beaton]] in [[London Weekend Television|LWT]]'s sitcom ''[[The Fosters (1976 TV series)|The Fosters]]'', Britain's first comedy series with predominantly black performers. His formative years were spent in [[working men's club]]s, where he impersonated mainly white characters such as the ''[[Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em]]'' character Frank Spencer (whom he impersonated on ''New Faces'').  He also made guest appearances on television programmes including ''[[Celebrity Squares]]'', ''[[Seaside Special]]'' and ''The [[Ronnie Corbett]] Show''.&lt;ref name=blackpool/&gt;

===1980s===
[[File:Lenny Henry 1980s (cropped 3).jpg|200px|thumb|right|Lenny Henry in the 1980s]]
In 1980, Henry performed in Summer Season in [[Blackpool]] with [[Cannon and Ball]].&lt;ref name="blackpool"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comedykings.co.uk/index.php/summer-season/1980-blackpool|title=Comedy Kings – an unofficial Cannon and Ball website|accessdate=4 March 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110310031220/http://www.comedykings.co.uk/index.php/summer-season/1980-blackpool|archivedate=10 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lenny"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lennyhenry.com/about/story.aspx|title=About Me: The Story So Far|accessdate=4 March 2011|author=Henry, Lenny|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713200520/http://www.lennyhenry.com/about/story.aspx|archivedate=13 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has since said that "the summer season was the first time [he] felt that [his] act had received a proper response from an audience".&lt;ref name="lenny"/&gt; Around the same time, he co-hosted the children's programme ''[[Tiswas]]'' from 1978 until 1981, and subsequently performed and wrote for the show ''[[Three of a Kind (TV series)|Three of a Kind]]''.

Also in 1980, he teamed up with ''[[The Comic Strip]]'' where he met his wife, comedian [[Dawn French]].&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/profiles/lenny_henry.shtml|title=BBC Comedy Profiles: Lenny Henry|accessdate=4 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She encouraged him to move over to the fledgling [[alternative comedy]] scene, where he established a career as a stand-up comedy performer and character comedian.

He introduced characters who both mocked and celebrated black British culture, such as Theophilus P. Wildebeeste (an homage to [[Teddy Pendergrass]] using the 'TP' initials), Brixton pirate radio disc jockey DJ Delbert Wilkins and Trevor MacDoughnut (a parody of [[Trevor McDonald]]). His stand-up material, which sold well on [[vinyl record|LP]], owed much to the writing abilities of [[Kim Fuller]]. During this time he also spent three years as a DJ on [[BBC Radio 1]], playing soul and electro tracks and introducing some of the characters that he would later popularise on television.  He made a guest appearance in the final episode of ''[[The Young Ones (TV series)|The Young Ones]]'' as The Postman, in 1984.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=oGeMmAo|title=The Young Ones – Summer Holiday – Part 3|date=11 April 2009|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0OD6RCb1II#t=5m10s|accessdate=23 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first series of ''[[The Lenny Henry Show]]'' appeared on the BBC in 1984. The show featured stand up, spoofs like his send-up of Michael Jackson's Thriller video, and many of the characters he had developed during Summer Season, including Theophilus P. Wildebeeste and Delbert Wilkins. A principal scriptwriter for his television and stage shows during the 1990s was [[Jon Canter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Pbjmgt.co.uk |url=http://www.pbjmgt.co.uk/clients/jon-canter |title=Jon Canter |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070315231002/http://www.pbjmgt.co.uk/clients/jon-canter/ |archivedate=15 March 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Bbc.co.uk|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/guide/talent/c/canter_jon.shtml|title=BBC Guide to Comedy: Jon Canter}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Lenny Henry Show'' ran periodically for a further 19 years in various incarnations. He performed impressions such as [[Tina Turner]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[Michael Jackson]], [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Run DMC]], among others.

Prior to the [[1987 general election (UK)|1987 general election]], Henry lent his support to [[Red Wedge]] by participating in a comedy tour organised by the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.labourlist.org/my-generation-red-wedge-paul-richards-weller-bragg |title=Where will the next generation get its political anthems from? |publisher=LabourList |accessdate=28 December 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716081859/http://www.labourlist.org/my-generation-red-wedge-paul-richards-weller-bragg |archivedate=16 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, he appeared in a TV film, ''[[Coast to Coast (1987 film)|Coast to Coast]]''. It was a comedy thriller with [[John Shea]] about two DJs with a shared passion for [[Motown]] music being chased across Britain.  The film has a strong following, but contractual problems&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guerilla-films.com/coast_to_coast.htm |title=''Coast To Coast'' details |publisher=guerilla films |accessdate=11 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130127045742/http://www.guerilla-films.com/coast_to_coast.htm |archivedate=27 January 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; have prevented it from being distributed on video or DVD.

===1990s===
In the early 1990s, Henry starred in the Hollywood film ''[[True Identity]]'', in which his character pretended to be a white person (using make-up, [[Facial prosthetic|prostheses]], and a wig) to avoid [[organised crime|the mob]]. The film was not commercially successful. In 1991, he starred in a BBC drama alongside [[Robbie Coltrane]] called ''[[Alive and Kicking (TV drama)|Alive and Kicking]]'', in which he played a heroin addict, which was based on a true story.

Also in 1991, he starred in the Christmas comedy [[Bernard and the Genie]] alongside [[Alan Cumming]] and [[Rowan Atkinson]]. Henry is known as the [[choleric]] [[chef]] Gareth Blackstock from the 1990s television comedy series ''[[Chef!]]'', or from his 1999 straight-acting lead role in the [[BBC]] drama ''[[Hope and Glory (TV series)|Hope And Glory]]''. He was co-creator with [[Neil Gaiman]] and producer of the 1996 BBC drama serial ''[[Neverwhere]]''.&lt;ref name="cornish"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cornish.edu/news/release/neil_gaimans_urban_fantasy_neverwhere_adapted_by_robert_kauzlaric_nov_6-10|title=Neil Gaiman's Urban Fantasy "Neverwhere", Adapted by Robert Kauzlaric, Nov 6–10|publisher=Cornish College of the Arts|date=9 October 2013|accessdate=8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Henry tried his hand at soul singing, appearing, for example, as a backing singer on [[Kate Bush]]'s album ''[[The Red Shoes (album)|The Red Shoes]]'' (1993){{citation needed|date=December 2015}} and, backed by [[David Gilmour]] of [[Pink Floyd]], at [[Amnesty International]]'s [[The Secret Policeman's Balls|Big 3-0]] fund raising concert.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Omnibus| isbn = 0-7119-4109-2| last1 = Miles| first1 = Barry| last2 = Mabbett| first2 = Andy| title = Pink Floyd - The Visual Documentary |year= 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; He would later say that neither move showed him at his best, and that he felt most comfortable with character comedy. He would occasionally return to singing, performing in small local venues in the West Midlands. Henry returned to the BBC to do ''[[Lenny Henry in Pieces]]'', a character-based comedy [[sketch comedy|sketch]] show which was followed by ''[[The Lenny Henry Show]]'', in which he combined stand-up, character sketches and song parodies.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

===2000s===

In 2003, Henry was listed in ''[[The Observer]]'' as one of the fifty funniest acts in British comedy. In 2004, he was listed in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' as the fifteenth funniest black performer of all time. Henry is associated with the British [[Comic Relief (charity)|Comic Relief]] charity organisation, along with his former wife, comedian [[Dawn French]], and [[Griff Rhys Jones]], and has hosted the show and also presented filmed reports from overseas on the work of the charity. He was the voice of the British [[speaking clock]] for two weeks in March 2003 in aid of Comic Relief.

Henry voiced Dre Head, the "[[shrunken head]]" on the [[Knight Bus]] in the 2004 movie ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (movie)|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]'', and read the audiobook version of [[Neil Gaiman]]'s ''[[Anansi Boys]]''. He also voiced a character on the children's show ''[[Little Robots]]''. Henry appeared in advertisements for butter products in New Zealand, commissioned by the company now known as [[Fonterra]], as well as portraying [[Saint Peter]] in the [[Virgin Mobile]] advertising campaign in South Africa. In the UK, he used his character of Theophilus P. Wildebeeste to advertise [[Alpen (food)|Alpen]] [[muesli]], and promoted the non-alcoholic [[lager]], [[Kaliber (product)|Kaliber]].

In June 2001, for a BBC documentary, he sailed a trimaran from Plymouth to Antigua, Jamaica with yachtsman Tony Bullimore. His motive was to as he put it, "have one last adventure". In 2005, he appeared in [[Birmingham]], as an act for "Jasper Carrott's Rock with Laughter". He appeared alongside performers such as [[Bill Bailey]], [[Jasper Carrott]], [[Bonnie Tyler]], [[Bobby Davro]] and the [[Lord of the Dance (musical)|Lord of the Dance]] troupe. In 2006, Henry starred in the BBC programme ''[[Berry's Way]]''. He did the voice of [[Characters in the Kirby video game series#Dark Nebula|Dark Nebula]] in ''[[Kirby: Squeak Squad]]''. On 16 March 2007, Henry made a [[cameo appearance]] as himself in a sketch with [[Catherine Tate]], who appeared in the guise of her character [[The Catherine Tate Show characters#Geordie Georgie|Geordie Georgie]] from ''[[The Catherine Tate Show]]''. The sketch was made for the BBC [[Red Nose Day]] fundraising programme of 2007.

On 16 June 2007 Lenny appeared with [[Chris Tarrant]] and [[Sally James (presenter)|Sally James]] to present a 25th Anniversary episode of ''[[Tiswas]]''. The show lasted 90 minutes and featured celebrities discussing their enjoyment of ''Tiswas'' as children, as well as appearances from kids and people who had appeared on the original show. In the summer of 2007, he presented ''Lenny's Britain'', a comedy documentary tour made with the Open University on [[BBC One]] on Tuesday nights. In late 2007, he hosted a stand-up comedy tour of the UK.

In early 2008, Henry's series ''[[lennyhenry.tv]]'' was broadcast on [[BBC One]]. The programme has an accompanying website of the same name and broadcasts strange, weird and generally amusing online videos and [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]] clips. He starred in the [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]] show ''[[Rudy's Rare Records]]''. On 31 December 2008 and 1 January 2009, he appeared on [[Jools Holland]]'s ''[[Hootenanny (UK TV series)|Hootenanny]]'' on BBC Two, singing part of the song ''[[Mercy (Duffy song)|Mercy]]'' along with singer [[Duffy (singer)|Duffy]]. In January 2009, he appeared on the BBC's comedy show, ''[[Live at the Apollo (TV series)|Live at The Apollo]]'', in which he played host for the night, introducing [[Andy Parsons]] and [[Ed Byrne (comedian)|Ed Byrne]], where he referred to Wikipedia as "Wrongopedia" for containing incorrect information about his life.

In October 2009, Henry reprised his role of Deakus to feature in comedy shorts about story writing alongside [[Nina Wadia]], [[Tara Palmer Tomkinson]] and [[Stephen K. Amos]]. He also offers his own writing tips and amusing anecdotes in the writing tips video clip on BBC raw words – story writing. He supplies the voices of both Big and Small in the [[BBC]] [[CBeebies]] Children's programs ''[[Big &amp; Small]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cbeebies/grownups/about/programmes/bigandsmall.shtml|title=BBC – CBeebies Grownups – Big &amp; Small|publisher=BBC|accessdate=5 October 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100326055808/http://www.bbc.co.uk/cbeebies/grownups/about/programmes/bigandsmall.shtml|archivedate=26 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010s===
In 2010, Henry produced and starred in a five-part web series for the BBC Comedy website, ''Conversations with my Wife'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/show/p007rcxp/lenny_henry|title=BBC Comedy – Conversations with my Wife|publisher=BBC|accessdate=1 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; about a fictional couple conversing over [[Skype]] while the wife is away on business leaving the husband (played by Henry) to hold the fort at home.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

In 2008, he became the face of budget hotel operator [[Premier Inn]], and to date continues to star in adverts for them. One of the adverts caused controversy and was banned from children's programming hours. The advert, from 2010, parodied a well-known scene from the film ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'', with Lenny Henry spoofing the scene originally starring [[Jack Nicholson]], by smashing a door with an axe and then thrusting his head through the door saying: "Here's Lenny."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/8584109.stm|title=Premier Inn 'horror' ad banned from children's network|publisher=BBC|accessdate=18 March 2012|date=24 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Henry presented a Saturday night magic series called ''[[The Magicians (UK TV series)|The Magicians]]'' on [[BBC One]]. The show returned in 2012, however, Henry was replaced by [[Darren McMullen]].

In March 2011, he appeared with [[Angela Rippon]], [[Samantha Womack]] and [[Reggie Yates]] in the BBC fundraising documentary for [[Comic Relief]] called ''Famous, Rich and in the Slums'', where the four celebrities were sent to [[Kibera]] in Kenya, Africa's largest [[slum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/mar/03/love-they-neighbour-review|title=TV Review|accessdate=4 March 2011|author=Mangan, L.|publisher=Guardian.co.uk|date=4 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Henry was criticised for his opening sketch for the 2011 Comic Relief, during which he spoofed the film ''[[The King's Speech]]'' and grew impatient with [[Colin Firth]]'s portrayal of [[King George VI]] as he stammered over his speech. ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' reported that the [[British Stammering Association]] had branded the sketch as "a gross and disgusting gleefulness at pointing out someone else's misfortune".&lt;ref name="kibera"&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/news/a310070/lenny-henry-criticised-for-speech-spoof.html|title=Digital Spy| accessdate=21 March 2011|author=Ryan Love|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Henry appeared in and produced a play based on his radio show ''Rudy's Rare Records'', which played at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre before moving on to a run in London.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/sep/14/rudys-rare-records-review-birmingham-rep-lenny-henry, "Rudy's Rare Records review"], theguardian.com, 14 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, ''[[Danny and the Human Zoo]]'' a ninety-minute film for television was made and shown, written by Henry and directed by [[Destiny Ekaragha]], it was a fictionalised account of the former's life as a teenager in 1970s [[Dudley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.list.co.uk/article/59060-bbc-orders-lenny-henry-biographical-drama|title=BBC orders Lenny Henry biographical drama|work=The List|date=28 February 2014|accessdate=8 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.virginmedia.com/tvradio/news/story/2014/02/28/bbc-orders-lenny-henry|title=BBC orders Lenny Henry biographical drama|work=Virgin Media|date=28 February 2014|accessdate=8 March 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304095336/http://www.virginmedia.com/tvradio/news/story/2014/02/28/bbc-orders-lenny-henry/|archivedate=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/whats-on/arts-culture-news/lenny-henrys-dudley-childhood-tv-6757371|title=Lenny Henry writes TV drama about Dudley childhood|work=Birmingham Mail|date=28 February 2014|accessdate=8 March 2014|author=Young, Gary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shakespeare==
In February 2009, Henry appeared in the [[Northern Broadsides]] production of ''[[Othello]]'', in the title role, at the [[West Yorkshire Playhouse]] in [[Leeds]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title =Lenny just a jealous guy... and it's no joke
|publisher=[[Yorkshire Evening Post]]|date=10 April 2008|accessdate=10 April 2008|url=http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/Lenny-just-a-jealous-guy.4559128.jp}}&lt;/ref&gt; directed by [[Barrie Rutter]], who, before the production opened, said of the decision to cast him: "knives might be out at me or at Lenny. I don't care. This has come about from a completely genuine desire to do a piece of theatrical work. Bloody hell, how long has the Donmar had Hollywood stars going there for £200? He's six-foot five. He's beautifully black. And he's [[Othello]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Brown|first=Mark|title=A new Moor for West Yorkshire|publisher=''The Guardian''|date=10 February 2008|url= https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/oct/02/lenny.henry.othello|accessdate=10 February 2008|location=London, England}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Henry received widespread critical acclaim in the role. [[Charles Spencer (journalist)|Charles Spencer]] in the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' said "This is one of the most astonishing debuts in Shakespeare I have ever seen. It is impossible to praise too highly Henry's courage in taking on so demanding and exposed a role, and then performing it with such authority and feeling."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Spencer|first=Charles|title=Othello with Lenny Henry at the West Yorkshire Playhouse, review|publisher=''[[Daily Telegraph]]''|date=19 February 2008|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/culturecritics/charlesspencer/4696028/Othello-with-Lenny-Henry-at-the-West-Yorkshire-Playhouse-review.html|accessdate=5 April 2008 |location=London, England}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Billington (critic)|Michael Billington]] in ''[[The Guardian]]'' noted "Henry's voice may not always measure up to the rhetorical music of the verse, but there is a simple dignity to his performance that touches one".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Michael Billington (critic)|Michael Billington]]|title=Othello|publisher=''The Guardian''|date=19 February 2008|url= https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/feb/19/othello-west-yorkshire-playhouse |accessdate=5 April 2008|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lynne Walker (critic)|Lynne Walker]] of ''[[The Independent]]'' said of Henry that his "emotional dynamism is in no doubt. The frenzy within his imagination explodes into rage and, finally, wretchedness. It's not a subtle reading but it works powerfully in this context."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Walker|first=Lynne|publisher=''The Independent''|date=19 February 2008|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/reviews/first-night-othello-quarry-theatre-west-yorkshire-playhouse-leeds-1626089.html|accessdate=5 April 2008|title=First Night: Othello, Quarry Theatre, West Yorkshire Playhouse, Leeds|location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Henry has said that he saw parallels between himself and Othello. "I'm used to being the only black person wherever I go...There was never a black or Asian director when I went to the BBC. Eventually I thought 'where are they all?' I spent a lot of time on my own. Things have changed a bit, but rarely at the BBC do I meet anyone of colour in a position of power."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Larkin|first=Maeve|title=Othello – Resource Pack|publisher=[[Northern Broadsides]]|date=19 February 2008|url=http://www.northern-broadsides.co.uk/PAGES/education/NORTHERN%20BROADSIDES%20-%20%20OTHELLO%20%20resource%20pack.pdf|accessdate=5 April 2008|format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100525023608/http://www.northern-broadsides.co.uk/PAGES/education/NORTHERN%20BROADSIDES%20-%20%20OTHELLO%20%20resource%20pack.pdf|archivedate=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The production was scheduled to transfer to the [[West End of London]] from 11 September to 12 December 2009, to be performed at the [[Trafalgar Studios]] in [[Whitehall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Henry brings Othello to West End|publisher=BBC News|date=24 April 2008|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8016608.stm|accessdate=24 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was introduced to Shakespeare when he made the 2006 [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]] series ''Lenny and Will'', which saw him going "in search of the magic of Shakespeare in performance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Othello – Resource Pack|publisher=BBC|date=25 March 2006|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/arts/pip/46ff6/|accessdate=5 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, Henry made his debut at the [[Royal National Theatre]] in London in Shakespeare's ''[[The Comedy of Errors]]'', directed by [[Dominic Cooke]], in which he played the character of Antipholus of Syracuse. The production was selected to be broadcast live to selected cinemas worldwide in March 2012 as part of the [[National Theatre Live]] programme. Henry's performance gained generally very positive reviews. Paul Taylor in ''[[The Independent]]'' wrote that "Henry beautifully conveys the tragicomic plight of an innocent abroad."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Taylor|first=Paul|title=First Night|publisher=''The Independent''|date=23 November 2011|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/reviews/first-night-the-comedy-of-errors-olivier-national-theatre-london-6269859.html|accessdate=3 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music career==
In 2015, Henry was asked by [[Sky Arts]] to produce a show for them, ''Lenny Henry's Got The Blues''. He worked with a group of musicians including [[Jakko Jakszyk]], lead singer of [[King Crimson]], to produce the album ''New Millennium Blues''. The album consists of both covers of blues classics, as well as original tracks co-written by Lenny.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/may/05/lenny-henry-music-career-blues-racism-prince The Guardian]&lt;/ref&gt; Henry later released "hard-hitting animated blues video" directed by Iranian filmmaker, [[Sam Chegini]] titled ''[[The Cops Don't Know]]'' which was premiered by ''[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]]'' magazine on 20 April 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://teamrock.com/news/2016-04-20/lenny-henry-launches-the-cops-don-t-know-video|title=Lenny Henry launches The Cops Don't Know video|date=20 April 2016|website=Classic Rock|language=en-GB|access-date=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Henry met [[Dawn French]] on the [[alternative comedy]] circuit. They married in 1984 in [[Covent Garden]], London. They adopted a daughter, Billie.&lt;ref name="connection"&gt;[http://news.independent.co.uk/people/profiles/article200198.ece "Dawn French: The French connection"]{{dead link|date=May 2015}} ''The Independent'' (UK). Retrieved 13 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 April 2010, French and Henry announced they were separating after 25 years of marriage. It was reported that the separation was amicable. They had decided to separate in October the previous year but left it until then as they were still in discussion over the separation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8606120.stm|title=Lenny Henry and Dawn French split|date=6 April 2010|publisher=BBC|accessdate=6 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their divorce was finalised in 2010.&lt;ref name="2nd marriage"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-22245439|title=Comedian Dawn French marries for second time|work=[[BBC Online]]|date=22 April 2013|accessdate=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He graduated with a degree in [[English Literature]] ([[Bachelor of Arts|BA Hons]]), from the [[Open University]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rte.ie/arts/2007/0430/henryl.html?rss Lenny Henry Collects Degree] 28 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; He studied for an [[Master of Arts|MA]] at [[Royal Holloway]], [[University of London]] in screenwriting for television and film, where he received a distinction; and in 2010 he began studying at the same institution for a PhD on the role of [[black people]] in the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=5 October 2010|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-11467235|title=Lenny Henry's long road to a PhD|publisher=BBC|accessdate=28 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His PhD was awarded in May 2018 for a thesis titled ''Does the Coach Have to be Black? The Sports Film, Screenwriting and Diversity: A Practice-Based Enquiry''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Saha |first1=Anamik |title=Massive congrats to DOCTOR Sir Lenny Henry on the completion of his PhD - a brilliant and innovative, auto-ethnographic, production study of screenplay development in relation to race and diversity in film (phew!).  |url=https://twitter.com/Anamik1977/status/996090491975368704 |publisher=Twitter |date=14 May 2018 |accessdate=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Henry has been an open critic of British television's lack of ethnic diversity in its programming. During a speech at the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]] in March 2014, he called the lack of minorities "appalling," and he has continued to raise the issue publicly since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Homa|last=Khaleeli|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/jun/20/lenny-henry-interview-diversity-tv-industry|title=Lenny Henry: diversity in the TV industry 'is worth fighting for'|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=20 June 2014|accessdate=28 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henry is a lifelong supporter of [[West Bromwich Albion Football Club]].

==Honours==

Henry was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE) in the [[1999 New Year Honours]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lenny sees red over nose ban|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/289125.stm|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=2 March 1999|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
