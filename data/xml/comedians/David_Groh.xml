'''David Lawrence Groh'''&lt;ref&gt;Full name as per [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/15/arts/television/15groh.html?ref=obituaries ''New York Times'' obit]&lt;/ref&gt; (May 21, 1939 – February 12, 2008)&lt;ref name="post"&gt;Noland, Claire.[http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/tv/la-me-groh14feb14,1,5015497.story "David Groh, 68; Husband on 'Rhoda'"]. ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. 14 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[United States|American]] [[actor]] best known for his portrayal of [[Joe Gerard]] in the 1970s television series ''[[Rhoda]]'', opposite [[Valerie Harper]].

==Early life and career==
Groh was born in [[Brooklyn]], the son of Mildred and Benjamin Groh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/89/David-Groh.html |title=David Groh Biography (1941-) |publisher=Filmreference.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had a sister, Marilyn.&lt;ref name=nyt /&gt; He attended [[Brooklyn Technical High School]], then enrolled at [[Brown University]] in [[Providence, Rhode Island]], where he graduated with a degree in [[English literature]].&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;Martin, ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;

He performed with the [[American Shakespeare Theatre]], then went to [[Great Britain]] to attend the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art on a [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright scholarship]], and served in the [[United States Army]] from 1963 to 1964.&lt;ref name=nyt /&gt; On his return to [[New York City]], he studied at [[The Actors Studio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|quote=|first=David |last=Garfield|title=A Player's Place: The Story of The Actors Studio|year=1980|publisher=MacMillan Publishing Co., Inc.|location=New York|isbn=0-02-542650-8|page=278|chapter=Appendix: Life Members of The Actors Studio as of January 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his [[television]] debut in silent walk-on parts in two episodes of the [[Gothic fiction|Gothic]] daytime [[soap opera]] ''[[Dark Shadows]]'' on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in 1968, but did not garner fame until ''[[Rhoda]]''.

==Career==
Groh co-starred in the sitcom ''[[Rhoda]]'' in which he played Joe Gerard, a [[New York City]] building demolition company owner who met and married [[Rhoda Morgenstern (fictional character)|Rhoda Morgenstern]], the best friend of [[Mary Richards]] from [[CBS]]'s ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]''. The show premiered September 9, 1974 and Joe and Rhoda married in the seventh episode. The network gave the marriage much advance publicity, and the episode proved a [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] blockbuster, having drawn some 50 million viewers&lt;ref name=hall&gt;Hall, Ken. [http://www.go-star.com/antiquing/groh.htm The Celebrity Collector: "David Groh, Most Memorably From 'Rhoda', Collects Early American Items"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070826012959/http://www.go-star.com/antiquing/groh.htm |date=2007-08-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to become one of television's most-watched single episodes.

In season three, the couple separated and later divorced. Groh was dropped to recurring status during season three, and he made only a few guest appearances the following season, before being written out of the show entirely. According to Valerie Harper, Groh was written out of the show when the producers decided that ''Rhoda'' worked better with its star as a single woman. "We all felt very bad about David not continuing," she said. The two remained lifelong friends.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/deaths/5543168.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226125833/http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/deaths/5543168.html |date=February 26, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this change was not embraced by the show's audience and ratings began to decline sharply. ''Rhoda'' was eventually canceled in the fall of 1978. Groh starred in his own series, the short-lived ''[[Another Day (TV series)|Another Day]]'', and went on to make his [[Broadway theatre]] debut in [[Neil Simon]]'s ''[[Chapter Two (play)|Chapter Two]]''.

From 1983 to 1985, Groh played [[D.L. Brock]] in the ABC soap opera ''[[General Hospital]]'', leaving the show to appear in the [[off Broadway]] play ''Be Happy for Me'' (1986). ''[[The New York Times]]'' [[drama critic]] [[Frank Rich]] found Groh ''"completely convincing as the brash gold-chain-and-bikini-clad [[Lothario]]"''.&lt;ref name=nyt /&gt; Other New York City theater credits include ''Road Show'' (1987), and ''[[The Twilight of the Golds]]'' (1993).

On television, Groh appeared in guest roles on such series as ''[[Buck Rogers in the 25th Century (TV series)|Buck Rogers in the 25th Century]]'',  ''[[L.A. Law]]'', ''[[Baywatch]]'', ''[[Law &amp; Order]]'', ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'', ''[[Melrose Place]]'', ''[[The X-Files]]'', and ''[[JAG (TV series)|JAG]]''. His film career includes appearances in ''[[Two-Minute Warning]]'' (1976), ''[[Smash-Up on Interstate 5]]'' (1976), ''[[Victory at Entebbe]]'' (1976), ''[[A Hero Ain't Nothin' but a Sandwich (film)|A Hero Ain't Nothin' but a Sandwich]]'' (1978), ''[[The Dream Merchants]]'' (1980), ''[[The Return of Superfly]]'' (1990), ''[[Get Shorty (film)|Get Shorty]]'' (1995), and several [[independent film]]s.

===Personal life===
Groh was a serious collector of antique furniture and folk art,&lt;ref name=hall /&gt; much of which he kept in a second home in [[Connecticut]]. He mainly resided, however, in [[Santa Monica, California]], where he lived with his third wife, Kristin, and his son Spencer &lt;ref name=nyt /&gt; (by his second wife).

===Death===
Groh died on February 12, 2008 of [[kidney cancer]] in a [[Los Angeles]] [[hospital]] at the age of 68.&lt;ref name=post/&gt;
