'''Joan Alexandra Molinsky'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/rivers-joan|title=Joan Rivers|last=Goldman|first=Shalom|work=Jewish Women's Archive|accessdate=March 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (June 8, 1933 – September 4, 2014), known professionally as '''Joan Rivers''', was an American comedian, actress, writer, producer, and television host. She was noted for her often controversial comedic persona—heavily self-deprecating or sharply acerbic, especially toward celebrities and politicians.

Rivers rose to prominence in 1965 as a guest on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson|The Tonight Show]]''. Hosted by her mentor, [[Johnny Carson]], the show established Rivers' comedic style. In 1986, with her own rival program, ''[[The Late Show (1986 TV series)|The Late Show with Joan Rivers]]'', Rivers became the first woman to host a late night network television talk show. She subsequently hosted ''[[The Joan Rivers Show]]'' (1989–1993), winning a [[Daytime Emmy Award|Daytime Emmy]] for Outstanding Talk Show Host.  Since the mid-1990s, she became known for her comedic [[red carpet]] awards show celebrity interviews,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLs4emOXWKg |title=Joan Rivers' Greatest Red Carpet Moments|publisher=[[ABC News]] |date=September 5, 2014|accessdate=April 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.eonline.com/news/576107/how-joan-rivers-changed-the-red-carpet-interview-forever-with-one-simple-question-watch-her-best-moments |title=How Joan Rivers Changed the Red Carpet Interview Forever With One Simple Question: Watch Her Best Moments!| publisher=[[E!]] |date=September 4, 2014|accessdate=April 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2009, she was the [[Celebrity Apprentice]] Winner. Rivers co-hosted the [[E!]] celebrity fashion show ''[[Fashion Police]]'' from 2010 to 2014 and starred in the reality series ''[[Joan &amp; Melissa: Joan Knows Best?]]'' (2011–2014) with daughter [[Melissa Rivers]]. She was the subject of the documentary ''[[Joan Rivers: A Piece of Work]]'' (2010).

In addition to marketing a line of jewelry and apparel on the [[QVC]] shopping channel, Rivers authored 12 best-selling books and three LP comedy albums under her own name: ''Mr. Phyllis And Other Funny Stories'' (Warner Bros 1965), ''The Next To Last Joan Rivers Album'' (Buddah 1969), and ''What Becomes A Semi-Legend Most?'' (Geffen 1983).  She was nominated in 1984 for a [[Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album|Grammy Award]] for her album ''What Becomes a Semi-Legend Most?;'' and was nominated in 1994 for the [[Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play]] for her performance of the title role in ''[[Sally Marr]]...and Her Escorts''. In 2015, Rivers posthumously received a [[Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album]] for her book, ''Diary of a Mad Diva''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2015/02/08/joan-rivers-wins-a-grammy/23090009/|title=Joan Rivers wins a Grammy|author=  Oldenburg, Ann|date=February 8, 2015|work=USA TODAY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, ''[[The New York Times]]'' television critic [[Jack Gould]] called Rivers "quite possibly the most intuitively funny woman alive".&lt;ref name="huff12"&gt;{{cite news |title=Joan Rivers Honors Robin Williams In Resurfaced Interview |work=Huffington Post|date=September 5, 2014|author=  Sieczkowski, Cavan |quote=Playboy: Jack Gould, former television critic of The New York Times, called you "quite possibly the most intuitively funny woman alive."

==Career==
===1950s–1960s===
[[File:Jim Connell Jake Holmes Joan Rivers circa 1960s.JPG|thumb|upright|Rivers with Jim Connell and [[Jake Holmes]] in "Jim, Jake &amp; Joan", circa early 1960s]]
During the late 1950s, Rivers appeared in a short off-[[Off-Broadway|Broadway]] run play, ''Driftwood'', co-starring [[Barbra Streisand]]. It ran for six weeks on playwright Maurice Tei Dunn's apartment on 49th Street, in NYC, according to an interview with ''[[Adweek]]''.{{Sfn|Rivers|1986|pages=85–96}}&lt;ref&gt;http://www.adweek.com/digital/2014-year-in-review-joan-rivers/&lt;/ref&gt; Rivers performed in numerous comedy clubs in the [[Greenwich Village]] area of New York City in the early 1960s, including [[The Bitter End]], [[The Gaslight Cafe]] {{Sfn|Rivers|1986|p=230}} and [[The Duplex]]. Between 1963 and 1964, Rivers, along with Jim Connell and [[Jake Holmes]], were in the  cabaret act "Jim, Jake &amp; Joan". A 1964 appearance at The Bitter End resulted in their appearance in the motion picture, ''Once Upon A Coffee House'', which was also Rivers' first big screen credit. The group parted ways shortly afterwards, on which member Holmes later recalled: "We were supposed to do this rally for [[Bobby Kennedy]], who was running for New York senator in 1964. We were going to play at the rally. Joan showed up with a [Republican Senate nominee Kenneth] [[Kenneth Keating|Keating]] button on. And Jim said take that off. She said no — she was sticking to her political guns. And Jim said, "Who needs you, anyway?" That was the end [of Jim, Jake &amp; Joan] [...]".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/story-joan-rivers-24-famous-731383&lt;/ref&gt;

She also made an appearance as a guest on the television program ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' originating from New York, hosted at the time by [[Jack Paar]].{{Sfn|Rivers|1986|pages=233–239}} By 1965, Rivers had a stint on ''[[Candid Camera]]'' as a gag writer and participant; she was "the bait" to lure people into ridiculous situations for the show. After seven auditions during a period of three years, she made her first appearance on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson|The Tonight Show]]'' with new host [[Johnny Carson]], on February 17, 1965.{{Sfn|Rivers|1986|pages=359–373}} Rivers credited this episode to be her breakthrough, as Carson said to her on the air "you're gonna be a star".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/joan-rivers-why-johnny-carson-398088&lt;/ref&gt; Following this appeareance, she became a frequent guest on the program and a close friend of Carson.

As her profile raised significantly in the subsequent years, she started to make guest-appearances in numerous popular shows, including ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', ''[[The Mike Douglas Show]]'', ''[[The Dick Cavett Show]]'' and ''Girl Talk'', with [[Virginia Graham]]. She also wrote material for the puppet [[Topo Gigio]]. She had a brief role in the cult drama film ''[[The Swimmer (1968 film)|The Swimmer]]'' (1968), starring [[Burt Lancaster]], and at the time, she also had a short-lived syndicated daytime talk show, ''That Show with Joan Rivers'', which premiered on September 16, 1968. Each episode had a theme and Rivers did an opening monologue based on the day's topic.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tv.com/shows/that-show-with-joan-rivers/&lt;/ref&gt; The show also featured an expert on the subject and a celebrity guest; [[Johnny Carson]] was her first guest.&lt;ref name=jr1969&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0124948|title=The Joan Rivers Show|publisher=Imdb.com|accessdate=April 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the middle of the 1960s, she released at least two comedy albums, ''The Next to Last Joan Rivers Album''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Next to Last Joan Rivers Album|url=http://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/joan_rivers/the_next_to_last_joan_rivers_album/ |accessdate=September 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Rivers Presents Mr. Phyllis &amp; Other Funny Stories''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Joan Rivers Presents Mr. Phyllis &amp; Other Funny Stories |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/joan-rivers-presents-mr-phyllis-and-other-funny-stories-mw0002076502 |accessdate=September 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1970s===
By the 1970s, Rivers continued to be a prominent fixture on television. Along with her other guest-spots on the late-night circuit, she also made appearances in ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]'', had a semi-regular stint on ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'' and guest-starred in ''[[Here's Lucy]]''. Rivers made her Broadway debut in the play ''Fun City'', which opened on January 2, 1972 and co-starred [[Gabriel Dell]], [[Rose Marie]] and [[Paul Ford]]. It ran for only nine performance amid a negative critical reception. Though a ''[[New York Times]]'' reviewer criticized the production as "frenetic to the point of being frazzled", he praised Rivers as "a deft comedy writer" and "a very funny lady".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1972/01/03/archives/stage-her-water-bed-frozen-solid-joan-rivers-is-star-in-comedy-fun.html&lt;/ref&gt; From 1972 to 1976, she narrated ''[[The Adventures of Letterman]]'', an animated segment for ''[[The Electric Company]]''.

In 1973, Rivers wrote the made-for-television movie ''[[The Girl Most Likely to...]]'', a black comedy starring [[Stockard Channing]] as an ugly girl who becomes beautiful after undergoing plastic surgery, and takes revenge of people who previously mistreated her. The film, based on a Rivers' story, became a ratings success and has been considered a "cult classic".&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com.co/books?id=qQQEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA62&amp;lpg=PA62&amp;dq=the+girl+most+likely+to+1973++film+success&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6nWV0zZ6lD&amp;sig=Ov657PkzAK1bNyZDbgYrr4uWkqQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjtif-9ldvZAhVS0FMKHQ9_CLUQ6AEIjQEwDQ#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20girl%20most%20likely%20to%201973%20%20film%20success&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; She also wrote a thrice-weekly column for ''The Chicago Tribune'' from 1973 to 1976, and published her first book, ''Having a Baby Can Be a Scream'', in 1974; she described it as a "catalogue of gynaecological anxieties".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/11075283/Joan-Rivers-obituary.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978, Rivers made her directorial debut with the comedy ''[[Rabbit Test (film)|Rabbit Test]]'', which she also wrote and starred her friend [[Billy Crystal]] in his film debut as the world's first pregnant man. The film flopped at the box office and was panned by critics.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vulture.com/2014/09/joan-rivers-directed-only-one-movie-pregnant-man-billy-crystal.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Janet Maslin]] of ''The New York Times'' concluded: "Miss Rivers has turned to directing without paying much heed to whether a whole movie constructed from one-liners is worth even the sum of its parts".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D04E1D71431E632A2575AC0A9629C946990D6CF&lt;/ref&gt; During the same decade, she was the opening act for singers [[Helen Reddy]], [[Robert Goulet]], [[Mac Davis]] and [[Sergio Franchi]] on the [[Las Vegas Strip]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Joan Rivers dies at age 81|url=http://www.mamamia.com.au/news/joan-rivers-dead/|accessdate=September 26, 2014|date=September 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s===
During the early and mid-1980s, Rivers found further success on stand-up and television, through the decade subsequently proved to be controversial for her. The year 1983, in particular, was very successful; she performed at [[Carnegie Hall]] in February,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://spectatorarchive.library.columbia.edu/cgi-bin/columbia?a=d&amp;d=cs19830209-01.2.12&amp;e=-------en-20--1--txt-txIN-Teichner-----|title=Joan Rivers at Carnegie Hall|work=Columbia Spectator|date= February 9, 1983|volume=CVII|number=66}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; did the March stand-up special ''[[An Audience With|An Audience with Joan Rivers]]'', hosted the April 9 episode of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', and released the best-selling comedy album ''What Becomes a Semi-Legend Most?'', which reached No. 22 on the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and was nominated for a [[Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album]].&lt;ref name=metrolyrics&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metrolyrics.com/1984-grammy-awards.html |title=Grammy Awards |publisher=Metrolyrics.com |date=February 28, 1984 |accessdate=April 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; By August 1983, Carson established Rivers as his first regular guest host on ''The Tonight Show''. At the time, she spoke of her primary ''Tonight Show'' life as having been "Johnny Carson's daughter", a reference to his longtime mentoring of her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0695000/ |title=Saturday Night Live |publisher=Imdb.com |date=April 9, 1983 |accessdate=April 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1980s and 1990s Rivers served on the advisory board of the [[National Student Film Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Editor|title=National Student Film Institute/L.A:  The Sixteenth Annual Los Angeles Student Film Festival|date=June 10, 1994|location=The Directors Guild Theatre|pages=10–11|accessdate=6 January 2018|ref=Program}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Editor|title=Los Angeles Student Film Institute: 13th Annual Student Film Festival|date=June 7, 1991|location=The Directors Guild Theatre|page=3|accessdate=6 January 2018|ref=Program}}&lt;/ref&gt; A friend of [[Nancy Reagan|Nancy]] and President [[Ronald Reagan]], Rivers attended a [[state dinner]] in 1983, and later, at the invitation of Nancy, spoke at luncheon at the [[1984 Republican National Convention]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lavender |first=Paige |date=September 4, 2014 |title=Joan Rivers Said Nancy Reagan Helped Her After Her Husband's Suicide |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/04/joan-rivers-nancy-reagan_n_5768458.html |newspaper=Huffington Post |accessdate=October 18, 2014 }}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |agency=Washington Post |title=Nancy Reagan didn't mine Joan Rivers' off-color jokes |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=QKxQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=heEDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5090%2C6067634 |newspaper=Eugene Register-Guard |date=August 24, 1984 |accessdate=October 18, 2014 }}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Joan Rivers Explains in 2012 E!

A television special based on the character, a mock tribute called ''Joan Rivers and Friends Salute Heidi Abramowitz,'' later aired on [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/21/movies/tv-weekend-comedy-a-la-cinemax-and-showtime.html&lt;/ref&gt; She later wrote her next book, ''Enter Talking'', which was released in 1986, and described her rise to stardom and the evolution of her comedic persona.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Enter-Talking-Joan-Rivers/dp/0385294409&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Joan Rivers 1987.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Rivers in 1987]]
In 1986 came the move that ended Rivers' longtime friendship with Johnny Carson. The soon-to-launch [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox Television Network]] announced that it was giving her a late night talk show, ''[[The Late Show (1986 TV series)|The Late Show Starring Joan Rivers]]'', making Rivers the first woman to have her own late-night talk show on a major network.{{Sfn|Hoyle|2013|p=197}}{{Sfn|King|1993|pages=47–48}} The new network planned to broadcast the show 11 p.m. to 12 a.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]], making her a Carson competitor. Carson learned of the show from Fox and not from Rivers. In the documentary, ''Johnny Carson: King of Late Night,'' Rivers said she only called Carson to discuss the matter after learning he may have already heard about it and that he immediately hung up on her. In the same interview, she said that she later came to believe that maybe she should have asked for his blessing before taking the job. Rivers was banned from appearing on the ''Tonight Show,'' a decision respected by Carson's first two successors [[Jay Leno]] and [[Conan O'Brien]]. Rivers did not appear on the ''Tonight Show'' again until February 17, 2014, when she made a brief appearance on new host [[Jimmy Fallon]]'s first episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Joan Rivers Returns To 'Tonight Show' After Decades-Long Ban|url=https://variety.com/2014/tv/news/joan-rivers-returns-to-tonight-show-after-decades-long-ban-1201109889/|accessdate=February 19, 2014|newspaper=Variety|date=February 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 27, 2014, Rivers returned to the show for an interview.

''The Late Show Starring Joan Rivers'' premiered on October 9, 1986 and soon turned out to be flecked by tragedy. When Rivers challenged FOX executives, who wanted to fire her husband [[Edgar Rosenberg]] as the show's producer, the network fired them both on May 15, 1987. Three months later, on August 14, 1987, Rosenberg committed suicide in Philadelphia; Rivers blamed the tragedy on his "humiliation" by Fox.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Joanne |last1=Kaufman|first2=Alan|last2= Carter|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20116863,00.html|title=Rocked by Tragedy and Failure, Joan Rivers Comes Back with a New Show and a New Life|work=People|date= February 19, 1990|accessdate=April 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rivers credited Nancy Reagan with helping her after her husband's suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kurtz |first=Judy |date=September 4, 2014 |title=Gillibrand, Nancy Reagan mourn Joan Rivers' death |url=http://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/in-the-know/216712-gillibrand-mourns-death-of-joan-rivers |newspaper=The Hill |accessdate=October 19, 2014 |quote=Rivers credited the former president's wife with helping her after the 1987 suicide of her husband, Edgar Rosenberg. The comedy queen recalled the conversation with Reagan in a 2010 interview, "I said, 'I can't get Edgar's body out of Philadelphia.' She said, 'Let me see what I can do.' The next day, his body came back to L.A. You don't ever forget that, especially when the chips are down." }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fox attempted to continue the show with a new name (''[[The Late Show (1986 TV series)|The Late Show]]'') and rotating guest hosts.

During the airing of her late-night show, she made the voice-over role of Dot Matrix in the science-fiction comedy ''[[Spaceballs]]'' (1987), a parody mainly on ''[[Star Wars]]''. The film, directed and co-starring [[Mel Brooks]], was a critical and commercial success, later becoming a "cult classic".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.allmovie.com/movie/spaceballs-v45901&lt;/ref&gt; After the Fox controversy, her career went into hiatus. Rivers subsequently appeared on various television shows, including the ''[[Pee-wee's Playhouse]]'' Christmas Special in December 1989. She also appeared as one of the center square occupants on the 1986–89 version of ''The [[Hollywood Squares]]'', hosted by [[John Davidson (entertainer)|John Davidson]]. On September 5, 1989, ''[[The Joan Rivers Show]]'', her daytime television program, premiered in [[broadcast syndication]]. The show, which ran for five seasons, was a success and earned Rivers the [[Daytime Emmy Award|Daytime Emmy]] in 1990 for Outstanding Talk Show Host.{{Sfn|TV Guide|2004|p=331}} ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', in a September 1990 article, asserted: "''The Joan Rivers Show'' is a better showcase for her funny edginess than her doomed 1988 Fox nighttime program was. The best thing about her daytime talker is that Rivers' stream-of-consciousness chattiness is allowed to guide the show — you never know where the conversation is going to go".&lt;ref&gt;http://ew.com/article/1990/09/14/joan-rivers-show/&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990s===
In addition to winning the Emmy for ''The Joan Rivers Show'', Rivers starred in the made-for-television comedy ''How to Murder a Millionaire'', which premiered in May 1990 on [[CBS]]. In the film, co-starring [[Alex Rocco]] and [[Telma Hopkins]], she took on the role of a [[Beverly Hills]] matron possessed with the idea her husband is trying to kill her.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.latimes.com/1990-05-20/news/tv-87_1_joan-rivers&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1990, she started to design jewelry, clothing and beauty products for the shopping channel [[QVC]]. On this professional endeavor, Rivers said: "In those days, only dead celebrities went on [QVC]. My career was over. I had bills to pay. [...] It also intrigued me at the beginning".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.forbes.com/sites/natalierobehmed/2015/10/27/the-curious-case-of-joan-rivers-qvc-line/#118a419e7cf8&lt;/ref&gt; The sales of Rivers' products exceed $1 billion by 2014, making her one of the network's top sellers.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/joan-rivers-rise-rags-tv-731620&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, she wrote her next book, ''Still Talking'', which described the cancellation of her late-night show and her husband's suicide.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Still-Talking-Joan-Rivers/dp/0517158531&lt;/ref&gt; Until 1993, she received five additional Emmy nominations for her daytime talk-show ''The Joan Rivers Show'' — two for Outstanding Writing – Special Class and three for Outstanding Talk Show Host.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0262164/awards&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, Rivers and daughter [[Melissa Rivers|Melissa]] first hosted the [[E!|E! Entertainment Television]] pre-awards show for the [[Golden Globe Award]]s{{Sfn|Rivers|1997|p=207}} and, beginning in 1995, E!'s annual [[Academy Awards]] pre-awards show as well.{{Sfn|Rivers|1997|p=207}} Rivers and her daughter quickly became credited for revolutionizing the red carpet as a space to showcase designers' work and celebrity interactions. "Joan and Melissa were the first people who came out and made it more of a true conversation between star and reporter", E!'s Senior Vice President of production, Gary Snegaroff, remarked to ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]''. "They asked about what [actresses] were wearing because that's what the magazines would cover after the fact, and turned it into a candid conversation on the carpet where anything could happen".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2014/08/red-carpet-history&lt;/ref&gt; Rivers and Melissa, at the time, both portrayed themselves in the made-for-television drama ''Tears and Laughter: The Joan and Melissa Rivers Story'', which chronicled the aftermath of Rosenburg's suicide. It aired on [[NBC]] on May 15, 1994.&lt;ref&gt;https://variety.com/1994/film/reviews/tears-and-laughter-the-joan-and-melissa-rivers-story-2-1200437248/&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, she wrote her book ''Jewelry by Joan Rivers''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Jewelry-Joan-Rivers/dp/1558598081&lt;/ref&gt;

Influenced by the stand-up comedy of [[Lenny Bruce]], Rivers co-wrote and starred in a play about Bruce's mother [[Sally Marr]], who was also a [[Stand-up comedy|stand-up comic]] and influenced her son's development as a comic. After 27 previews, ''Sally Marr&amp;nbsp;... and Her Escorts,'' a play "suggested by the life of Sally Marr" ran on Broadway for 50 performances in May and June 1994.&lt;ref name="Sally Marr"&gt;{{cite news|last=Scheck|first=Frank|title='Sally Marr' Ranks High Only With Joan Rivers Fans|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/1994/0516/16122.html|accessdate=December 28, 2013|newspaper=Christian Science Monitor|date=May 16, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; The production received mixed reviews, but her performance was applauded by critics.

Rivers was a guest speaker at the opening of the American Operating Room Nurses' San Francisco Conference in 2000, and by the first part of the decade, she continued to host the awards' red carpet for the [[E!]] channel. Between 2002 and 2004, she embarked on tour with her one-person comedy show ''Joan Rivers: Broke and Alone'', which was presented in the United Kingdom ([[Edinburgh]] and [[London]]) and in the United States ([[Los Angeles]], and [[Boston]]), to generally positive reviews.&lt;ref&gt;http://onstageboston.com/Articles/2004/03/March/rivers.html&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Telegraph'' felt that her "hilarious assaults on fellow celebrities and tirades about the perils of ageing and plastic surgery are well worth the expense",&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3576255/Critics-choice-stage.html&lt;/ref&gt; while ''The Guardian'' remarked that "Rivers returned triumphant, a victorious heavyweight after a great fight, conscious that she is still the champion".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2002/apr/16/comedy.artsfeatures&lt;/ref&gt;

The program, which ran for two seasons, followed Rivers traveling around the United States interviewing self-made millionaires.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20151204224006/http://community.foxtel.com.au/t5/Foxtel-Blog/New-This-Week-Dec-7-40-new-shows-including-Da-Vinci-s-Demons/ba-p/102717&lt;/ref&gt; She also wrote two books in 2009: ''Murder at the Academy Awards (R): A Red Carpet Murder Mystery'' and ''Men Are Stupid...And They Like Big Boobs: A Woman's Guide to Beauty Through Plastic Surgery (with Valerie Frankel)''.

===2010s===
A documentary film about Rivers, ''[[Joan Rivers: A Piece of Work]]'', premiered at the [[San Francisco International Film Festival]] on May 6, 2010. The film follows Rivers for 14 months, mostly during the 76th year of her life,&lt;ref name="NYT Synopsis"&gt;{{cite news|title=A Comic's Life and Times: Enter Talking or Mocking|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2010/06/11/movies/11joan.html|accessdate=May 16, 2012|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=June 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and made an effort to "[peel] away the mask" and expose the "struggles, sacrifices and joy of living life as a ground breaking female performer."&lt;ref name="IFC Synopsis"&gt;{{cite web|title=Joan Rivers - A Piece of Work|url=http://www.ifcfilms.com/films/joan-rivers-a-piece-of-work|publisher=IFC Entertainment|accessdate=May 16, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120626061308/http://www.ifcfilms.com/films/joan-rivers-a-piece-of-work|archivedate=June 26, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The documentary found commercial success in its limited release and was acclaimed by critics for providing "an honest, behind-the-scenes look at [Rivers]' career — and at show business in general".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/joan_rivers_a_piece_of_work?&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning on September 10, 2010, Rivers co-hosted the [[E!]] show ''[[Fashion Police]]'', along with [[Giuliana Rancic]], [[Kelly Osbourne]], and [[George Kotsiopoulos]], commenting on celebrity fashion. The show started as a half-hour program but due to its success with viewers, it was expanded to one hour on March 9, 2012. The August 26, 2014 episode of ''Fashion Police'', about the [[66th Primetime Emmy Awards]] and the 2014 [[MTV Movie Awards]], was her last television appearance before her death.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/joan-rivers-remains-on-life-support-five-days-after-heart-and-lung-failure-comediennes-daughter-9707928.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Rivers appeared in a commercial for [[Go Daddy]], which debuted during the broadcast of [[Super Bowl XLV]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/2011/02/07/2011-02-07_joan_rivers_go_daddy_super_bowl_commerical_is_that_really_the_77yearold_comedien.html|title=Joan Rivers Go Daddy Super Bowl commerical [sic]: Is that really the 77-year-old comedienne's body?|last=Weiss|first=Shari|date=February 7, 2011|work=[[New York Daily News]]|accessdate=February 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was featured as herself in the season two of [[Louis C.K.]]'s self-titled show ''[[Louie (U.S. TV series)|Louie]]'', where she performed on-stage. Also in 2011, Rivers and her daughter starred in the reality show ''[[Joan &amp; Melissa: Joan Knows Best?]]'', which premiered on [[WE tv]]. The series follows her moving in with her daughter to California to be closer to her family. The show ran for four seasons until 2014. On the December 4, 2011 episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', "[[The Ten-Per-Cent Solution]]", Rivers took on the role of Annie Dubinsky, an agent trying to revive [[Krusty]]'s career.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tvguide.com/news/weekend-tv-guide-1040315/&lt;/ref&gt; Hayden Childs of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' praised the choice of having Rivers guest star since she was able to "employ her trademark humor within the world of ''The Simpsons'' without hijacking the plot or satire".&lt;ref&gt;https://tv.avclub.com/the-simpsons-the-ten-per-cent-solution-1798170729&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, she guest-starred in two episodes of two series: ''[[Drop Dead Diva]]'' and ''[[Hot in Cleveland]]''.

Rivers released her eleventh book ''I Hate Everyone...Starting with Me'' on June 5, 2012. It received generally positive reviews and made [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]] for several weeks. ''The New York Times'' remarked that there were "more punch lines per paragraph than any book I've read in years",&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/25/books/following-tina-fey-comedians-churn-out-books.html?mtrref=www.google.com.co&amp;gwh=183B62FC2F1EDC08FE6EC4BDEEA2E74D&amp;gwt=pay&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Publishers Weekly'' felt that "Rivers is equally passionate and opinionated on every subject she discusses. Hilarious and undeniably original".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Diary-Mad-Diva-Joan-Rivers/dp/0425269027&lt;/ref&gt; On August 7, 2012, Rivers showed up in [[Burbank, California]] to protest that the warehouse club [[Costco]] would not sell the book. She handcuffed herself to a shopping cart and shouted through a megaphone. The police were called to the scene and she left without incident; no arrests were made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Abbey|first=Jennifer|title=Joan Rivers Chains Herself to Costco Shopping Cart in Protest|url=http://gma.yahoo.com/blogs/abc-blogs/joan-rivers-chains-herself-costco-shopping-cart-protest-134450183--abc-news-celebrities.html|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=August 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 5, 2013, she launched the online talk show ''[[In Bed with Joan]]'' on YouTube. In it, Rivers invited a different guest to talk to her in bed about different things including their past, their love life and their career.

Rivers released her twelfth book, ''Diary of a Mad Diva'', on July 1, 2014, which also made ''The NY Times'' Best Seller list.&lt;ref&gt;The New York Times Best Seller list&lt;/ref&gt; For the book, she posthumously won the [[Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album]] in 2015. Before her death, she filmed a part, along with other female comedians, for the documentary ''MAKERS: Women in Comedy'', which premiered on PBS in October 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2014/09/30/women-in-comedy-doc-joan-rivers/|title='MAKERS: Women in Comedy' director recalls interviewing Joan Rivers|work=Entertainment Weekly's EW.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comedic style==
{{quote box|width=30em|quote="He was an epiphany. Lenny told the truth. It was a total affirmation for me that I was on the right track long before anyone said it to me.

During her 55-year career as a comedian, her tough-talking style of satirical humor was both praised and criticized as truthful, yet too personal, too gossipy, and very often abrasive. Nonetheless, with her ability to "tell it like it is," she became a pioneer of contemporary stand-up comedy. Commenting about her style, she told biographer [[Gerald Nachman (journalist)|Gerald Nachman]], "Maybe I started it. We're a very gossipy culture. All we want to know now is private lives."{{Sfn|Nachman|2003|p=619}} However, her style of humor, which often relied on making jokes about her own life and [[Satire|satirizing]] the lives of celebrities and public figures, was sometimes criticized as insensitive. Her jokes about [[Elizabeth Taylor]] and [[Adele]]'s weight, for instance, were often commented on, although Rivers would never apologize for her humor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/joan-rivers-calls-adele-chubby-says-the-singer-should-lose-weight-2013313|title=Joan Rivers Calls Adele 'Chubby', Says the Singer Should 'Lose Weight'|work=[[Us Weekly]]|first=Zach|last=Johnson|date=March 31, 2013|accessdate=February 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/joan-rivers-sticks-fat-adele-comments-article-1.1304702|title= Joan Rivers sticks to 'fat' Adele comments after singer demands apology: 'She should just calm down — or lose weight!'|work=New York Daily News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rivers, who was Jewish, was also criticized for making jokes about [[the Holocaust]] and later explained, "This is the way I remind people about the Holocaust. I do it through humor", adding, "my husband lost his entire family in the Holocaust."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.monstersandcritics.com/smallscreen/news/article_1712229.php/Leave-Joan-Rivers-alone-Holocaust-remark-part-of-her-lifelong-comedic-style-VIDEO |title=Leave Joan Rivers alone!

You can tune me out, you can click me off, it's OK. I am not going to bow to [[political correctness]]. But you do have to learn, if you want to be a satirist, you can't be part of the party."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/joan-rivers-best-jokes-one-565826|title=Joan Rivers Interview: Her 6 best one-liners|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=June 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an unknown stand-up comedian out of college, she struggled for many years before finding her comic style. She did stints in the [[Catskills]] and found that she disliked the older style of comedy at the time, such as [[Phyllis Diller]]'s, who she felt was a pioneer female comedian.&lt;ref name=Greenspoon&gt;Leonard Jay Greenspoon, ed. ''Jews and Humor'', Purdue University Press (2011) p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; Her breakthrough came at [[The Second City]] in Chicago in 1961, where she was dubbed "the best girl since [[Elaine May]]," who also got her start there. But May became her and fellow comedian [[Treva Silverman]]'s role model, as Rivers saw her as "an assertive woman with a marvelous, fast mind and, at the same time, pretty and feminine."&lt;ref name=Greenspoon/&gt; It was also there that she learned "self reliance," she said, "that I didn't have to talk down in my humor" and could still earn an income by making intelligent people laugh. "I was really born as a comedian at Second City. I owe it my career."{{Sfn|Nachman|2003|p=607}}

[[File:Joan Rivers - Life in Progress - Fringe.jpg|thumb|left|Rivers performing in her show at the 2008 [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]]]]
In early 1965, at the suggestion of comedian [[Bill Cosby]], Johnny Carson gave Rivers, whom he billed as a comedy writer, her debut appearance on his show.&lt;ref name=Zoglin&gt;Zoglin, Richard. ''Comedy at the Edge: How Stand-up in the 1970s Changed America'', Bloomsbury Publishing (2008) e-book&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUKI-_TXuUY Joan Rivers on Johnny Carson Show]&lt;/ref&gt; Cosby, who knew Rivers from their early stand-up days, described her as "an intelligent girl without being a weirdo ... a human being, not a kook."{{Sfn|Nachman|2003|p=596}} Sitting alongside Johnny after her monologue, she displayed an intimate, conversational style which he appreciated, and she was invited back eight more times that year.&lt;ref name=Zoglin/&gt; ''Time'' magazine compared her humor to that of [[Woody Allen]], by expressing "how to be neurotic about practically everything," but noting that "her style and femininity make her something special." Rivers also compared herself to Allen, stating: "He was a writer, which I basically was ... and talking about things that affected our generation that nobody else talked about."{{Sfn|Nachman|2003|p=596}} ''The New York Times'' critic [[Charles L. Mee]] likewise compared her to Allen, explaining that her "style was personal, an autobiographical stream-of-consciousness."&lt;ref name=Zoglin /&gt;

Rivers' image contrasted starkly with Carson's stage demeanor, which was one of the reasons he made her co-host according to critic [[Michael Pollan]], who compared their style of humor: Where Carson is scrupulously polite, Rivers is bitchy; where he is low-key, she is overheated; where he is Midwest, Waspy and proper, she is urban, ethnic and gossipy. Carson conducts interviews as if he were at the country club; Rivers does hers at the kitchen table.&lt;ref&gt;Timberg, Bernard. ''Television Talk: A History of the TV Talk Show'', University of Texas Press (2002) p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; In her personal life, she had fewer of those neurotic or intense character traits, according to Ralph Schoenstein, who dated her and worked with her on her humor books. He said, "She has no airs. She doesn't stand on ceremony. The woman has absolutely no pretense. She'll tell you everything immediately. Joan isn't cool—she's completely open. It's all grist. It's her old thing—'Can we talk?'"{{Sfn|Nachman|2003|p=623}} According to biographer [[Victoria Price]], Rivers' humor was notable for taking aim at and overturning what had been considered acceptable female behavior. By her bravura she broke through long-standing taboos in humor, which paved the way for other women, including [[Roseanne Barr]], [[Ellen DeGeneres]] and [[Rosie O'Donnell]].{{Sfn|Price|2000|pages=219–220}}

==Personal life==
In 2002, Rivers told the ''[[Montreal Mirror]]'' that she was a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hays |first=Matthew |title=Can she talk |work=[[Montreal Mirror]] |year=2002 |url=http://www.montrealmirror.com/ARCHIVES/2002/070402/comedy1.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021116053759/http://www.montrealmirror.com/ARCHIVES/2002/070402/comedy1.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=November 16, 2002 |accessdate=May 18, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 28, 2014, during a conversation between Rivers and Reza Farahan of the ''[[Shahs of Sunset]]'', Melissa Rivers interjected to clarify that she and her mother were "[[Fiscal conservatism|fiscally conservative]], [[Cultural liberalism|socially liberal]]" Republicans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rivers|first=Joan|title=In Bed With Joan|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSnM3t7giOg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rivers was raised in [[Reform Judaism]]; she stated in a 2008 interview that she considered herself to be more [[agnostic]] and she "did not believe in the afterlife."&lt;ref name=stephenson/&gt;

===Relationships and family===
Rivers' first marriage was in 1955 to James Sanger, the son of a [[Bond Clothing Stores]] merchandise manager.&lt;ref name="nytimescomicstiletto"/&gt;{{Sfn|Rivers|1986|pages=67–71}} The marriage lasted six months&lt;ref name="nytimescomicstiletto"/&gt;{{Sfn|Rivers|1986|pages=182–183}} and was annulled on the basis that Sanger did not want children and had not informed Rivers before the wedding.{{Sfn|Rivers|1986|p=70}}

In her book ''Bouncing Back'', Rivers described how she developed [[bulimia nervosa]] after the 1987 suicide of Rosenberg, and the subsequent death of her [[psychologist]], with whom she'd developed a close friendship, of [[AIDS]].&lt;ref name=stephenson/&gt; Additionally, Rivers' relationship with her daughter had been strained at the time; according to Rivers, the confluence of events resulted in her contemplating suicide in her California home.&lt;ref name=stephenson/&gt; "I got the gun out, the whole thing," she recalled in a 2008 interview. "And [then] my dog came and sat in my lap... and that was a big turning point in my life.

She had her nose thinned while still at college; her next procedure, an [[Blepharoplasty|eye lift]], was performed in 1965 (when she was in her thirties) as an attempt to further her career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Talk about a boob job: Joan Rivers' hymn to the joys of plastic surgery leaves Carole Cadwalladr feeling queasy|work=The Observer|author= Cadwalladr, Carole|date= February 21, 2009| url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/feb/22/joan-rivers-plastic-surgery-books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kron|first=Joan|date=July 2005|title=Nip/Talk|journal=[[Allure (magazine)|Allure]]|publisher=[[Condé Nast]]|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-134837369/niptalk-interview-joan-rivers.html|accessdate=January 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; When promoting her book, ''Men Are Stupid ...

After nearly two months of investigations, federal officials said on November 10 that the clinic made a number of mistakes both before and during the procedure. Among those were the clinic's failure to respond to Rivers' deteriorating vital signs, including a severe drop in her blood pressure, possibly administering an incorrect anesthetic dosage, performing a surgical procedure without her consent, and other medical-clinic irregularities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/11/nyregion/joan-riverss-doctor-didnt-immediately-notice-deteriorating-vital-signs-federal-inquiry-says.html?_r=0 "Joan Rivers' Treatment Had Numerous Violations, U.S. Inquiry Finds"], ''New York Times'', November 10, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/nov/11/joan-rivers-clinic-series-mistakes-routine-surgery-that-led-to-her-death "Joan Rivers' daughter 'outraged' over mistakes that led to comedian's death"], ''The Guardian'', U.K., November 11, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
