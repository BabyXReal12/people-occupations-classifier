'''Todd Steven Glass''' (born December 16, 1963)&lt;ref name="advocate"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Klein"&gt;{{cite web|first=Michael |last=Klein |url=http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/the-insider/odd_Glass_Funny_as_a_heart_attack.html |title=Todd Glass: Funny as a heart attack |publisher=Philly.com |date=2010-04-22 |accessdate=2014-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[United States|American]] stand-up comedian originally from [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]].

==Life and career==
Glass was born and raised in the suburbs of [[Philadelphia|Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]. He first began performing stand-up comedy in Philadelphia in 1982 while attending [[Conestoga High School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Dan |last=Gross |url=http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/phillygossip/137441033.html |title=Paoli native comedian Todd Glass reveals he's gay |publisher=Philly.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=You Made It Weird podcast, timestamp 08:30 |url=http://www.nerdist.com/2013/01/you-made-it-weird-117-todd-glass/|accessdate=February 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his earliest television appearances in the late 80s on A&amp;E's ''[[An Evening at the Improv]]'' and in the early 1990s on several [[Comedy Central]] stand-up programs.

Glass is perhaps best known for his appearances as a contestant on the second and third seasons of [[NBC]]'s ''[[Last Comic Standing]]'' and has appeared regularly on programs such as ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'', ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'', ''[[Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn]]'', ''[[The Dennis Miller Show]]'', ''[[Politically Incorrect]]'', ''[[Louie (U.S. TV series)|Louie]]'', ''[[Tosh.0]]'', ''[[Mr. Show with Bob and David]]'', ''[[Preston and Steve]]'' and had his own [[Comedy Central Presents]] special in 2001.

In 2001, Glass released his debut stand-up album called ''Vintage Todd Glass and Other Crap'' and was also featured on the two CD set of the ''[[Comedy Death-Ray (album)|Comedy Death-Ray]]'', a compilation album of various stand-up comics performing at the popular ''[[Comedy Death-Ray]]'' comedy showcase at the [[Upright Citizens Brigade Theater]] in Los Angeles. His most recently released album ''Thin Pig'', was released on July 7, 2009 on [[Comedy Central Records]].

In August 2011, his new [[podcast]] ''The Todd Glass Show'' debuted on [[The Nerdist]] podcasting network.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christineetaylor.com/2011/08/new-todd-glass-podcast.html The New Todd Glass Podcast] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324101306/http://www.christineetaylor.com/2011/08/new-todd-glass-podcast.html |date=March 24, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He hosts the show along with frequent co-host Eric Ohlsen and a regular lineup of guests and crew including comedians [[Rory Scovel]] (and his wife Jordan) and Blake Wexler, audio engineers Katie Levine, Aristotle "Jet Ski" Acevedo, and musicians Lynn Shore and Joe MacKenzie, who write and perform many of the show's various "jingles" and audio cues. Glass also tours regularly. It has been rated the #1 podcast by the Podcasters Association of America (PAA) every year since its debut.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

==Personal life==
On April 16, 2010, Glass collapsed backstage at a [[Los Angeles]] comedy club after suffering a [[heart attack]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150908082531/http://articles.philly.com/2010-05-19/news/24959875_1_kate-smith-flyers-owner-ed-snider-joe-watson Letter-perfect honor for Kate Smith]&lt;/ref&gt; Glass appeared on ''[[The Bonnie Hunt Show]]'' only nine days later, talking about his recent "brush with death". Glass said he found out he had 100% blockage in his arteries and following an [[angioplasty]], declared that he was doing fine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ccinsider.comedycentral.com/2010/04/30/todd-glass-doesnt-let-heart-attacks-get-in-his-way/ Todd Glass Doesn't Let Heart Attacks Get In His Way] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100521172345/http://ccinsider.comedycentral.com/2010/04/30/todd-glass-doesnt-let-heart-attacks-get-in-his-way/ |date=May 21, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Glass blamed these health problems on bad genetics. Both parents had a history of heart problems; Todd's father had his first heart attack at age 30 and died of a subsequent heart attack at age 46.&lt;ref name="Klein"/&gt; On December 20, 2012, Glass talked about his heart attack on the ''[[The Adam Carolla Show (podcast)|Adam Carolla Show]]'', and said that he had lost 30 pounds since the incident. He had also stopped smoking (he previously maintained a "pack-a-month" habit), and that he had started taking the drug [[Lipitor]] to prevent further heart attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Carolla|first=Adam|title=Todd Glass Live From the Hollywood Improv|url=http://adamcarolla.com/todd-glass-live-from-the-hollywood-improv/|work=The Adam Carolla Show Podcast|publisher=Carolla Digital|accessdate=December 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Glass [[coming out|came out]] publicly as gay on January 16, 2012, during an episode of fellow comedian [[Marc Maron]]'s  [[WTF with Marc Maron|WTF podcast]]. The information had previously been known to friends and family, and Glass explained that he was worried about coming out publicly, but the recent string of [[suicide among LGBT youth]] motivated him to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episodes/episode_245_-_todd_glass |title=Episode 245 – Todd Glass |last=Maron |first=Marc |date=January 16, 2012 |work=WTF |accessdate=January 16, 2012| quote=Todd Glass returns to the garage for a very different conversation than the one he and Marc shared the last time. It's an honest, open discussion unlike any other heard on WTF.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
