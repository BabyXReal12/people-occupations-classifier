==Career==
[[File:Belushi.jpg|thumb|left|Belushi at the [[39th Venice International Film Festival]] in 1982]]
From 1977 to 1980, Belushi, like his older brother [[John Belushi]], worked with the Chicago theater group [[The Second City]]. During this period, Belushi made his television debut in [[1978-79 United States network television schedule|1978]]'s ''[[Who's Watching the Kids]]'' and also had a small part in [[Brian De Palma]]'s ''[[The Fury (1978 film)|The Fury]]''. His first significant role was in [[Michael Mann (film director)|Michael Mann]]'s ''[[Thief (film)|Thief]]'' (1981). After his elder brother John's death, [[History of Saturday Night Live (1980-1985)|from 1983 to 1985]] he appeared on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''; he portrayed characters such as Hank Rippy from "Hello, Trudy!" and "That White Guy". Belushi also appeared in the film ''[[Trading Places]]'' as a drunk man in a gorilla suit during a New Year's Eve party. He made a guest appearance in [[Faerie Tale Theatre]]'s third-season episode ''Pinocchio'', starring [[Paul Reubens]] as the titular puppet.

Belushi rose to greater prominence with his supporting roles in ''[[The Man with One Red Shoe]]'' (1985), ''[[About Last Night...]]'', ''[[Salvador (film)|Salvador]]'' and ''[[Little Shop of Horrors (film)|Little Shop of Horrors]]'' (as Patrick Martin) (all 1986), which opened up opportunities for lead roles. He has starred in films including ''[[Real Men (film)|Real Men]]'', ''[[The Principal]]'', ''[[Red Heat]]'', ''[[Homer and Eddie]]'', ''[[K-9 (film)|K-9]]'', ''[[Dimenticare Palermo]]'', ''[[Taking Care of Business (film)|Taking Care of Business]]'', ''[[Mr. Destiny]]'', ''[[Only the Lonely (film)|Only the Lonely]]'', ''[[Curly Sue]]'', ''[[Once Upon A Crime]]'', ''[[Wild Palms]]'', ''Royce'', ''[[Race the Sun]]'', ''[[Jingle All The Way]]'', ''[[Separate Lives (1995 film)|Separate Lives]]'', ''[[Retroactive (film)|Retroactive]]'', ''[[Gang Related (film)|Gang Related]]'', ''[[Angel's Dance]]'' and ''[[Joe Somebody]]'' (2001).

His voice work includes ''[[Mighty Ducks (TV series)|The Mighty Ducks]]'', ''[[The Pebble and the Penguin]]'', ''[[Babes in Toyland (1997 film)|Babes in Toy land]]'', ''[[Gargoyles (TV series)|Gargoyles]]'' and ''[[Hey Arnold!]]'', and the more recent ''[[Hoodwinked]]'', ''[[Scooby-Doo! and the Goblin King]]'' and ''[[The Wild]]''. He also lent his vocal talents for ''[[9: The Last Resort]]'' (a [[personal computer|PC]] game released in 1995), in which he portrayed "Salty", a coarse yet helpful character. In 1997, he portrayed the "Masked Mutant" in the Goosebumps PC video game, alongside [[Adam West]] as "The Galloping Gazelle". On January 4, 2001, Belushi appeared on the ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'' episode "[[ER (season 7)|Piece of Mind]]". The episode focused on both [[Dr. Mark Greene]]'s life-or-death [[brain surgery]] in New York and Belushi's character, who had been in a car accident with his son in Chicago. Belushi's performance contributed to his re-emergence in the public eye, and the following year he was cast as the title role in ABC's ''[[According to Jim]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biography.com/people/james-belushi-20851499#recent-years |title=Jim Belushi stars as suburban father in According to Jim |last= |first= |date= |website=[[Biography.com]] |access-date=August 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first animation voice-over was as a pimple on Krum's head in ''[[Aaahh!!! Real Monsters]]'' on [[Nickelodeon]]. That performance led him to be cast in the continuing role as Simon the Monster Hunter in that series, where he ad-libbed much of his own dialogue.
