'''Miranda Katherine Hart Dyke'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://www.burkespeerage.com/Search/FamilyHomepageFull.aspx?FID=6267  |title=Miranda Hart |website=burkespeerage.com  |accessdate=18 May 2012  |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; (born 14 December 1972), known professionally as '''Miranda Hart''', is an English actress, model, and&lt;!-- !!!DON'T CHANGE TO COMEDIENNE - see [[Talk:Miranda_Hart#Comedian.2Fcomedienne]]--&gt; comedian. Following drama training at the [[Academy of Live and Recorded Arts]], Hart began writing material for the [[Edinburgh Fringe Festival]] and making appearances in various British sitcoms including ''[[Hyperdrive (TV series)|Hyperdrive]]'' and ''[[Not Going Out]]''.

Hart reached a wider audience with her self-driven semi-autobiographical BBC [[sitcom]] ''[[Miranda (TV series)|Miranda]]'', which is based on her earlier [[BBC Radio 2]] radio series ''Miranda Hart's Joke Shop'' (2008). The television sitcom ran for three series and several Christmas specials from 2009 to 2015 and earned its star 3 [[Royal Television Society]] awards, 4 [[British Comedy Awards]] and 4 [[BAFTA]] nominations. In 2012, she began appearing in the BBC drama ''[[Call the Midwife]]'' as Camilla "Chummy" Fortescue-Cholmondeley-Browne. She made her Hollywood debut in [[Paul Feig]]'s film ''[[Spy (2015 film)|Spy]]'' (2015) as [[Melissa McCarthy]]'s sidekick Nancy B. Artingstall.

Hart has also written four books: ''Is It Just Me?'' (2012), a semi-autobiographical book; ''The Best of Miranda'' (2014), a compilation of scripts from the TV series; ''Peggy and Me'' (2016), a description of her life since owning her titular dog; and ''Miranda Hart's Daily Dose of Such Fun!'' (2017), in partnership with [[Comic Relief]]. She embarked on her first stand-up tour, ''My, What I Call, Live Show'', which toured arenas in the UK and Ireland in 2014 and was later released on DVD. In 2017, Hart presented the [[Royal Variety Performance]] in the presence of the [[Duke of Cambridge]] and the [[Duchess of Cambridge]] making her the first solo female presenter in 105 years.

==Early life==

===Family===
Miranda was born on 14 December 1972 in [[Torquay]], [[Devon]], the daughter of Captain [[David Hart Dyke]] and Diana Margaret Luce.&lt;ref name=peer1&gt;{{cite web |title=Miranda Katharine Hart Dyke |url=http://www.thepeerage.com/p33052.htm#i330519 |work=The Peerage |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704163623/http://www.thepeerage.com/p33052.htm#i330519 |archivedate=4 July 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father was [[commanding officer]] of {{HMS|Coventry|D118|6}} when it was sunk by the Argentinians in the [[Falklands War|1982 Falklands conflict]], and he was badly burned in trying to escape the stricken warship. She has a younger sister, Alice Louisa Hart Dyke (born 1975).

Hart descends from [[baron]]s, [[marquess]]es, [[earl]]s, and [[duke]]s,&lt;ref name=peer1/&gt; but she hates saying she is from an aristocratic background and does not consider herself upper class.&lt;ref name="dailyexp"/&gt; Hart added that her [[family tree|genealogy]] can be traced back to the 12th century and that her aunt and uncle (Sarah and Guy Hart Dyke) live in a castle that they cannot afford to run.&lt;ref name="thesphinx"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.thesphinx.co.uk/2011/07/10-things-you-didn%E2%80%99t-know-about%E2%80%A6-miranda-hart-such-fun/ |title=10 things you didn’t know about… Miranda Hart.

Her paternal family can be traced through her grandfather, Eric Hart Dyke. Her paternal great-great-great-grandfather was cricketer and Rector [[Thomas Dyke (cricketer)|Thomas Dyke]]. Hart's patrilineal great-great-great-great-grandfather was Sir Percival Hart Dyke, 5th Baronet (1767–1846). Her distant cousin, the 10th and present [[baronet]], [[Dyke baronets|Sir David Hart Dyke]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hart Dyke, David Ontario, Hamilton East – Stoney Creek, Green Party of Canada |url=http://v1.theglobeandmail.com/elections/fed2008/candidates/generated/35032_GRN.html |accessdate=28 May 2016 |agency=Federal Election 2008 |work=Globe and Mail |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160811212633/http://v1.theglobeandmail.com/elections/fed2008/candidates/generated/35032_GRN.html |archivedate=11 August 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; lives in Canada. One of her first cousins is plant hunter [[Tom Hart Dyke]], creator of the World of Gardens at [[Lullingstone Castle]].&lt;ref name="thesphinx" /&gt;&lt;ref name="express388020"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.express.co.uk/celebrity-news/388020/Gosh-It-looks-like-Miranda-really-is-frightfully-posh |title=Gosh! It looks like Miranda really is frightfully posh |last=Reynolds |first=Mark |date=30 March 2013 |newspaper=[[The Daily Express]] |access-date=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her maternal grandfather was [[William Luce (governor)|Sir William Luce]] (1907–1977), who was Commander-in-Chief and [[Colony of Aden#Governors of Aden colony|Governor of Aden]] (1956–60).&lt;ref name="dailyexp"&gt;{{cite news |title=Tragedy and despair behind Miranda Hart's rise to the top |url=http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/302418/Tragedy-and-despair-behind-Miranda-Hart-s-rise-to-the-top |newspaper=The Daily Express |date=16 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother's only sibling is [[Richard Luce, Baron Luce|the Lord Luce]], a former [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] and [[Government minister|minister]], later [[Governor of Gibraltar|HM Governor and Commander in Chief of Gibraltar]] (1997–2000) and [[Lord Chamberlain|Lord Chamberlain of the Royal Household]] (2000–06). Richard's son, the journalist and author [[Edward Luce]], is one of Miranda Hart's first cousins.&lt;ref name="express388020" /&gt;

Her great-uncle, the brother of her maternal grandfather, was Admiral [[David Luce|Sir David Luce]], who served as [[First Sea Lord]]. The father of David and William, Miranda Hart's great-grandfather, was Rear Admiral [[John Luce (Royal Navy officer)|John Luce]]. John's brother, her great-great-uncle, was Major General [[Richard Luce (surgeon)|Sir Richard Harman Luce]], who served as [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Derby (UK Parliament constituency)|Derby]] (1924–29).

Her other maternal great-grandfather (through William's wife Margaret Napier) was Vice Admiral Sir [[Trevylyan Napier]], who was the [[North America and West Indies Station|Commander-in-Chief, America and West Indies Station]] (1919–20). His wife, Miranda's great-grandmother, was Mary Elizabeth Culme-Seymour, daughter of [[Sir Michael Culme-Seymour, 3rd Baronet]], [[Vice-Admiral of the United Kingdom]] (1901–20). Both the Culme-Seymours were implicated in the [[Edward Mylius|Mylius affair]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Thomas |first1=Donald |title=Freedom's frontier: censorship in modern Britain |date=2007 |publisher=John Murray |page=400}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ashdown-Hill |first1=John |title=Royal Marriage Secrets: Consorts &amp; Concubines, Bigamists &amp; Bastards |date=2013 |publisher=The History Press |page=224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hart is a fourth cousin, twice removed, of [[Diana, Princess of Wales]]. Their common ancestors were [[George Spencer, 2nd Earl Spencer]] and his wife [[Lavinia Spencer, Countess Spencer]]. Through the 2nd Earl Spencer, both Miranda and Diana descend from [[Margaret Pole, Countess of Salisbury]]. If [[Lucy Walter|Lucy Walter's]] younger child Mary did have royal paternity as she maintained throughout her life, Hart is the ten-times-great-granddaughter of [[Charles II of England]].

==Career==

===Television===
Before her own series was commissioned, Hart made appearances in various British sitcoms. In ''[[Not Going Out]]'' she initially appeared as an acupuncturist.

===Radio===
Her semi-autobiographical series ''Miranda Hart's Joke Shop'' was aired on [[BBC Radio 2]] in 2008 and went on from there to be developed into the television series ''Miranda''.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} Hart has also presented comedy specials for the network alongside [[Jon Holmes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/media/news/a311498/miranda-hart-rejoins-bbc-radio-2.html |title=Miranda Hart rejoins BBC Radio 2 |website=Digital Spy |first=Andrew |last=Laughlin |date=28 March 2011 |accessdate=16 October 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011143954/http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/media/news/a311498/miranda-hart-rejoins-bbc-radio-2.html |archivedate=11 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2011 she attracted criticism after co-hosting ''[[The Chris Evans Breakfast Show]]'' with Holmes while [[Chris Evans (presenter)|Chris Evans]] was on holiday. The website ''[[Digital Spy]]'' reported that some listeners were unhappy with the quality of the programme. The BBC issued a statement in response saying, "Miranda Hart is one of the UK's best-loved comedians and BBC Radio 2 felt it appropriate to bring her warmth to its audience for a week. Jon Holmes is a highly experienced presenter from BBC Radio 6 Music [...] BBC Radio 2 appreciates if their presentation wasn't to everyone's liking, but feels it's important to be able to bring new talent to its output and hopes its audience understands the importance of maintaining a breadth of content on the network."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/media/news/a344503/bbc-responds-to-miranda-hart-complaints.html |title=BBC responds to Miranda Hart complaint |website=Digital Spy |first=Colin |last=Daniels |date=8 October 2011 |accessdate=16 October 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111010165818/http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/media/news/a344503/bbc-responds-to-miranda-hart-complaints.html |archivedate=10 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
