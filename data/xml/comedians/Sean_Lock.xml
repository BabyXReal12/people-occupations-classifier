'''Sean Lock''' (born 22 April 1963)&lt;ref name="Courier"/&gt; is an English comedian and actor. He began his comedy career as a [[stand-up comedian]], won the [[British Comedy Awards|British Comedy Award]] in 2000 in the category of [[British Comedy Awards 2000#Best Live Comic|Best Live Comic]], and was nominated for the [[Perrier Comedy Award]]. 

Lock is well known for his appearances on television and radio. He has written material for  [[Bill Bailey]], [[Lee Evans (comedian)|Lee Evans]] and [[Mark Lamarr]] and was voted the 55th greatest stand-up comic on Channel 4's 100 Greatest Stand-Ups in 2007 and again in the updated 2010 list as the 19th greatest stand-up comic. He is possibly best known for his role as a team captain on Channel 4 comedy panel show ''[[8 Out of 10 Cats]]'' since it began in 2005 up to 2015, and on ''[[8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown]]'' since 2012. His comedy frequently features [[deadpan]] delivery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theskinny.co.uk/festivals/uk-festivals/comedy/in-profile-sean-lock|title=In Profile: Sean Lock|last=Whelan|first=Edward|work=[[The Skinny (magazine)|The Skinny]]|date=19 March 2010|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life and career==
Lock attended [[St John the Baptist School, Woking|St John the Baptist School]], [[Woking]], Surrey. Before becoming a [[comedian]], he was a [[labourer]]&lt;ref name="BBC profile"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/people/sean_lock_person_page.shtml |title=Comedy – People A-Z – Sean Lock |publisher=BBC |accessdate=5 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; on [[building site]]s.&lt;ref name="Ross"&gt;[[Friday Night with Jonathan Ross]], 25 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, he developed [[skin cancer]].&lt;ref name="Australian Daily Telegraph"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/lifestyle/comedian-sean-locks-one-night-stand-saves-his-life/story-e6frf019-1225962763321|title=Comedian Sean Lock's one night stand saves his life |publisher=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=9 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also worked a series of odd jobs including three months as a goatherd for a hippie in the mountains of central France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Catherine Jones |url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/liverpool-entertainment/echo-entertainment/2010/10/08/comedian-sean-lock-heads-for-the-southport-comedy-week-100252-27426976/2/#ixzz1rUy5Capn |title=Entertainment – ECHO Entertainment News – Comedian Sean Lock heads for the Southport Comedy Week |publisher=Liverpool Echo |date= |accessdate=14 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lock's early television work included a supporting role alongside [[Robert Newman (comedian)|Rob Newman]] and [[David Baddiel]] in the 1993 series ''[[Newman and Baddiel in Pieces]]'' including touring  with them as their support act. Lock credits [[Frank Skinner]] and [[Eddie Izzard]] as major influences on his comedy.

Lock is an [[atheist]].&lt;ref&gt;Lockipedia Live (2010 stand-up show)&lt;/ref&gt;

==''15 Minutes of Misery'' and ''15 Storeys High''==
Lock made regular appearances on various radio panel shows, script-edited for [[Bill Bailey]]'s 1998 BBC2 series, ''[[Is It Bill Bailey?]]'' and had his own show on BBC Radio 4, ''15 Minutes of Misery''.

As the title suggested, these shows filled a 15-minute time-slot and also featured [[Kevin Eldon]] and [[Hattie Hayridge]]. The premise involved Lock eavesdropping on his neighbours in his south London tower block (all played by Lock, Eldon and Hayridge) using a bugging device fitted by his plumber, "Hot Bob" (Eldon), which was known as "The Bugger King" (and had "nothing to do with meat or sex").

''15 Minutes of Misery'' lasted for one series of six programmes in late 1998 and early 1999, and would later be expanded into the half-hour series ''[[15 Storeys High]]''. From ostensibly the same tower block, Lock's character was now given a flatmate (the hapless Errol) and a job at the local swimming baths, as well as a somewhat dour and intolerant demeanour.

The bugging device was no longer used, but the antics of Lock's neighbours still featured heavily in the show. The plots for this series were more linear in a "traditional" sitcom style, although they still showed Lock's brand of dark, [[surreal humour]].

''15 Storeys High'' would transfer to television after two radio series, with Lock's character renamed 'Vince', for a further two series in 2002 and 2004.

==Other work==

In 1995, Lock played an escaped murderer in an episode of ''The World of Lee Evans'', alongside [[Lee Evans (comedian)|Lee Evans]] and [[Phil Daniels]].

Lock wrote the screenplay for [[Andrew Kötting]]'s 2001 feature film ''This Filthy Earth'', based on the novel ''[[La Terre]]'' by [[Émile Zola]].

In 2004, Lock had a guest appearance in television's first ever "dope opera", ''[[Top Buzzer]]'', written by [[Johnny Vaughan]]. In 2005 he became a regular team captain on the [[panel game]] ''[[8 Out of 10 Cats]]''.

In spring 2006, he hosted his own entertainment show on [[Channel 4]] called ''[[TV Heaven, Telly Hell]]''. Lock narrated  the BBC production ''World Cup Goals Galore'' in 2006. In 2008 he appeared on ''[[The Big Fat Quiz of the Year]]'', on a team with [[James Corden]]. Lock has also appeared on many popular British TV panel shows including ''[[Have I Got News for You]]'', ''[[QI]]'' and ''[[They Think It's All Over (TV series)|They Think It's All Over]]''. He was also a celebrity guest in [[The Last Leg]]. Lock became "The Curator" for the second radio series of [[The Museum of Curiosity]], in 2009, taking over from [[Bill Bailey]]. During an interview on [[This Morning (TV programme)|This Morning]] in 2013, Lock announced he would now only appear on [[8 Out of 10 Cats]], as he felt he had become typecast for appearing on panel shows, joking that people had started approaching him in the street asking "Are you [[Dave (TV channel)|Dave]]?"

In 2010, Lock took part in ''[[Channel 4's Comedy Gala]]'', a [[Benefit concert|benefit show]] held in aid of [[Great Ormond Street Hospital|Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital]], filmed live at the [[The O2 Arena (London)|O2 Arena]].  He has also appeared in a spoof video produced by [[Shelter (charity)|Shelter]], the housing charity, to highlight the problem of rogue landlords.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1tB9y55UrI&amp;feature=player_embedded |title=Evict Rogue Landlords (video)|publisher=Shelter |accessdate=30 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2011, Sean Lock took over from [[John Sergeant (journalist)|John Sergeant]] as the host of the [[Dave (TV Channel)|Dave]] comedy panel show, ''[[Argumental]]''.

Sean Lock has also been a team captain on ''[[8 Out of 10 Cats]] (2005-2015)'' and ''[[8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown]]'' (2012-Present).
