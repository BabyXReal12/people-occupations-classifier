'''Art Paul Schlosser''' (born January 4, 1960) as Arthur P. Schlosser is an artist, [[cartoonist]], comedian, journalist, musician, poet, singer, and songwriter based in [[Madison, Wisconsin]]. He plays humorous novelty, gospel, and political songs and draws cartoons currently for Madison Street Pulse Newspaper, where he also submits poems and interviews people. Schlosser also paints and has participated in various art projects.

Schlosser was named Arthur after his father and grandfather but his grandfather might have originally been named Otto but because of his German accent when he said his name they thought he said Arthur.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

== Childhood ==
Schlosser was born in [[Chicago]] and grew up listening to [[novelty song|novelty]] musicians like [[Allen Sherman]] and [[Tiny Tim (musician)|Tiny Tim]], as well as funny songs by [[The Beatles]] and [[The Monkees]]. When Art was 11, he, his mother, and his sisters moved to [[Madison, Wisconsin]] after his parents got a divorce. As a child in Madison, his mother continued to play weird and funny songs for him, sometimes playing strange sound effects on one recorded player to go with the songs. As a teenager, Art Paul joined a work experience play group that encouraged Art to be creative. In this group, there were a couple of fans of [[The Beatles]], one of whom encouraged Art Paul to write lyrics. It was from that time on that Art started to write. Art would listen to the [[Dr Demento]] radio show as well as other strange records that he discovered at the local library, and then try to write some lyrics he was inspired to write after listening to the songs. Also as a child he was encouraged to draw cartoons by his sister Mary.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}
