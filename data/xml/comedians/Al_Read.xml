'''Al Read''' (3 March 1909 &amp;ndash; 9 September 1987) was a British radio comedian active throughout the 1950s and 1960s.

Read was born in [[Broughton, Salford|Broughton]], [[County Borough of Salford|Salford]],&lt;ref&gt;He was born in 1909 when Broughton was part of the County Borough of Salford (1844–1974 — "City" status from 1926)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lancashire]] and was a sausage maker in his father's business. He became known as a popular [[public speaking|after-dinner speaker]] with wry and well-observed humour in clubs. In 1950 Read made his radio début on the [[BBC Radio|BBC]]. His comedy was based around the [[monologue]] form, but he also became known for dialogues in which he played both voices. His humour was observational and was about [[Northern England|Northern English]] [[working class]] people, often in a domestic situation.

''The Al Read Show'' was one of the most popular radio comedy shows in the UK in the 1950s and 1960s. Up to 35 million people listened to it each week. His catchphrases "Right, Monkey!" and "You'll be lucky - I say, you'll be lucky!" were well known. In 1963 he headed a variety format for [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] called ''Life and Al Read'' which was apparently unscripted and was broadcast live. In 1966 another ITV series called ''Al Read Says What a Life!'' was broadcast. He also worked extensively on the variety stage.

In 1954 he appeared high on the bill at the ''[[Royal Variety Performance]]'' at the [[London Palladium]]. In 1959 he appeared with comedian [[Jimmy Clitheroe]] in the Royal Northern Variety Performance, in the presence of the Queen Mother, at the [[Palace Theatre, Manchester|Palace Theatre]], [[Manchester]].

The introduction to his radio show was usually "Al Read: introducing us to ourselves"; and he himself described his work as "pictures of life".
