'''Maria Elizabeth Sheldon Bamford''' (born September 3, 1970)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; is an American [[stand-up comedy|stand-up comedian]], [[actress]], and [[voice actress]].

== Early life and education ==
Maria Bamford was born on September 3, 1970 at the Port Hueneme Naval Base in [[Port Hueneme, California]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0051469/bio|title=Maria Bamford|website=IMDb|access-date=2016-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, her father, Joel Bamford, was serving as a Navy doctor. She grew up in [[Duluth, Minnesota]], where she attended Chester Park Elementary and [[Marshall School|Duluth Marshall School]]. Bamford has stated that when she was younger she was often troubled with her anxiety, depression, and bouts of what she has called "Unwanted Thoughts Syndrome", a subset of [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]].&lt;ref name="Corbett"/&gt;

Upon graduating, she attended [[Bates College]] in [[Lewiston, Maine]]. In a 2014 interview with ''[[The New York Times]],'' Bamford elaborated on her experience as a college student. She recalled as a sophomore at Bates in 1990 she felt "isolated" and in "a period of despair", when she called the college's [[Crisis hotline|suicide hotline]] after she ate a large amount of food in order to [[Self-harm|self harm]].&lt;ref name="Corbett"/&gt;

In 1992, Bamford transferred to the [[University of Edinburgh]] in [[Scotland]] at the start of her junior year. While at the university she became the first female member of the college's improvised comedy group, [[Improverts|The Improverts]]. After a year in Scotland, she transferred back to her home state and enrolled at the [[University of Minnesota]], where she earned a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in [[creative writing]]. She started doing stand-up in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]] at age 19, at Stevie Ray's Comedy Cabaret.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Career==

=== Early comedy beginnings: 1998–2008 ===
Bamford has been in a number of movies and television shows, including voice appearances in cartoons. She was the voice of Shriek in ''[[CatDog]]'', a huge selection of secondary characters in [[Cartoon Network]]'s ''[[Adventure Time]]'', and Mrs. Botsford, Violet, and Leslie on the long running [[PBS]] educational series ''[[WordGirl]]''. She does various impersonations (including her mother and her agent).  Her stand-up comedy often takes the form of [[vignette (literature)|vignettes]] rather than the standard setup/punchline format.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0051469/|title=Maria Bamford|website=IMDb|access-date=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bamford was featured in the documentary series ''[[The Comedians of Comedy]]'' on [[Comedy Central]] and [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]], and appears in short skits titled ''The Maria Bamford Show'', broadcast on the website [[Super Deluxe]].  She appears on the comedy compilation CD ''[[Comedy Death-Ray (album)|Comedy Death-Ray]]''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Rise to prominence: 2008–2014 ===
Her album ''Unwanted Thoughts Syndrome'', produced by [[Comedy Central Records]], was released in April 2009 and includes a DVD containing ''The Maria Bamford Show'' episodes. During the Christmas 2009-2010 shopping seasons, Bamford was featured in a series of [[Target Corporation|Target]] commercials, portraying an overachieving shopper determined to be first in line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Joel|last=Keller|url= http://www.tvsquad.com/2009/11/24/maria-bamford-plays-a-demented-shopper-in-new-target-ads/|title= Maria Bamford plays a demented shopper in new Target ads|work= TVSquad |publisher= AOL Television|date= November 24, 2009|accessdate=March 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Christmas 2009, she released a free stand-up special online as a gift to her fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{vimeo|id=7944778|title=Maria Bamford's One-Hour Homemade Christmas Special!}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While working in voice-over shows and advertisements in [[Los Angeles]], she was hospitalized three times over the course of 18 months for nervous breakdowns. She commented on the hospital visits by saying "it was the responsible thing to do" after she felt "suicidal" and "dispirited". At the time she was seeing a therapist weekly and a psychiatrist every three months.&lt;ref name="Corbett"/&gt;

In 2012 she released ''The Special Special Special'' for download through Chill.com. The special was recorded at her own home in Los Angeles with only Bamford's parents present as the audience and is now available on [[Netflix]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chill.com/MariaBamfoo/the-special-special-special |title=Maria Bamford: the special special special! |publisher=Chill |date=November 29, 2012 |accessdate=July 20, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130119075646/http://chill.com/MariaBamfoo/the-special-special-special |archivedate=January 19, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Corbett"/&gt;

In 2013, Bamford created and stars in a web series called ''Ask My Mom''. Maria plays both herself and her mother, who answers questions sent in by fans.&lt;ref name="slate"&gt;{{cite web|first=David|last=Haglund|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2013/06/06/maria_bamford_interview_ask_my_mom_arrested_development_and_learning_improv.html|title=Maria Bamford on Arrested Development and Her New Web Series, Ask My Mom!|website=[[Slate.com]]|publisher=[[The Slate Group]]|location=San Francisco, California|date=June 6, 2013|accessdate=June 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2013, Bamford appeared as herself in one episode of the interview web series ''All Growz Up with Melinda Hill''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Brian|last=Balthazar|title="All Growz Up" Talks To Maria Bamford In A Back Alley|url=http://popgoestheweek.com/2013/09/watch-all-growz-up-talks-to-maria-bamford-in-a-back-alley/|website=popgoestheweek.com|date=September 25, 2013|accessdate=October 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She provides the voice of Pema in [[Nickelodeon]] cartoon ''[[The Legend of Korra]]''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 2013, she appeared in season four of ''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]]'' as DeBrie Bardeaux, [[List of Arrested Development characters|Tobias Fünke]]'s love interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Onion|first=Rebecca|title=Tobias gets served.|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/tv_club/features/2013/arrested_development_season_4_reviews/episodes/arrested_development_season_4_a_new_start_recap_maria_bamford_s_debrie_charms.html|work=Slate|accessdate=May 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series creator noted Bamford as a comical "genius" and said that "real artists [like Maria] talk about things that nobody else talks about, and talk about them candidly.”&lt;ref name="Corbett"/&gt;

Bamford was asked to be involved in the writing process. She did not write any episode herself, but was in the writers' room often, discussing ideas and "hanging out" with the writers. The writers had freedom to modify her experiences for creative purposes.&lt;ref name="Fox 2016"&gt;{{cite web|first=Jesse David|last=Fox|url=http://www.vulture.com/2016/04/first-look-at-maria-bamfords-lady-dynamite.html|title=Maria Bamford Walks You Through Lady Dynamite|website=Vulture.com|publisher=[[New York Media]]|location=New York City|date=May 20, 2016|access-date=July 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}Bamford's unique [[Comedic genres|comedic style]] has drawn praise and criticism. She is best known for her portrayal of her [[dysfunctional family]] and [[self-deprecating]] comedy involving jokes about [[Depression (mood)|depression]] and [[anxiety]]. Her comedy style is [[surreal humour|surreal]] and incorporates [[Impressionist (entertainment)|voice impressions]] of various character types.

A 2014 ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' profile of Bamford noted her comedic style by saying: &lt;blockquote&gt;Much of Bamford’s work examines the relationship between “people” — generally well-intentioned friends and family — and those who grapple with depression or anxiety or any other challenge to the [[Psychology|psyche]]. Her act is a series of monologues and mini-skits performed rapid fire and often without regard for transition. Deploying a range of [[deadpan]] voices, she mimics the faux-enlightened who hover around the afflicted, offering toothless platitudes, bootstrapping pep talks or concern warped by self-interest. The humor of any given moment relies not so much on punch lines as it does on the impeccably timed swerves of her tone, the interplay between Bamford’s persona and those of all the people who don’t get her.&lt;ref name="Corbett"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Personal life==
Bamford stated in an interview with ''[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]'' that she has been diagnosed with [[bipolar II disorder]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=David|last=Burger|url=http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/entertainment/52050618-81/maria-utah-bamford-comic.html.csp|title=Comic Maria Bamford will cross personal boundaries at Utah show|newspaper=[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]|publisher=Huntsman Family Investments, LLC|location=Salt Laker City, Utah|date=June 22, 2011|quote=I was re-diagnosed (after a three-day stay at the hospital) as Bipolar II}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]] (OCD)&lt;ref name="Sims"/&gt; - "the new gladiator sandal", as she puts it in her comic performances.&lt;ref name="Corbett"/&gt;

On December 11, 2014, during her show at the Neptune Theater in [[Seattle]], Bamford announced that she was engaged to artist Scott Marvel Cassidy.&lt;ref name=TucsonStar&gt;{{cite news|first1=Cathalena|last1=Burch|title=Comic takes on politics, understanding conservatives and suicide|url=http://tucson.com/entertainment/blogs/caliente-tuned-in/comic-takes-on-politics-understanding-conservatives-and-suicide/article_f86f01ad-033e-55ec-9827-87e4519a9357.html|work=[[Arizona Daily Star]]|publisher=[[Lee Enterprises]]|location=Tucson, Arizona|date=September 4, 2014|accessdate=December 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were married at a private ceremony in 2015. Bamford has one sister, Sarah Seidelmann, who is a [[life coach]] and [[shaman]]. She has a private residence in [[Los Angeles|Los Angeles, California]].&lt;ref name="Corbett"/&gt; She is also a fan of [[pugs]], and had two, Blossom and Bert, the former who passed away in 2011 after an incident for which Bamford blamed herself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Casey|last=Burchby|url=http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/maria-bamford-comedian-dogs|title=Comedian Maria Bamford Still Blames Herself for Her Dog's Accident|work=Dogster|date=November 9, 2012|access-date=December 6, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
