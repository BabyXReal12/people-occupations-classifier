In October 2012, she placed sixth overall in the San Francisco Comedy festival. In April 2001, she headlined at the [[Melbourne International Comedy Festival]].

She won the 2003 Norman G. Brooks Standup Comedy Scholarship Competition held at the [[Hollywood]] [[The Improv|Improv]]. In August 2003, she was part of the "US Comedy Invasion" show, performing at the world’s largest arts festival, the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] in [[Scotland]]. She then embarked on a UK tour in the spring of 2004. She featured at the Edinburgh Fringe again in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theedinburghreporter.co.uk/2013/08/edinburgh-festival-fringe-2013-review-interview-tanyalee-davis-big-trouble-in-little-gina/|title=Edinburgh Festival Fringe 2013 – REVIEW &amp; INTERVIEW – Tanyalee Davis – Big Trouble in Little ‘Gina ****|date=2013-08-17|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, she was featured on [[Last Comic Standing]] in 2004,  on [[Animal Planet]]'s hit show, ''[[Pit Boss]]'' (2012) as well as ''[[Dr Drew]]'' on [[CNN]]. Previous credits include ''[[Austin Powers in Goldmember]]'' movie teaser,  "For the Love of Money"(Movie 2002), [[MTV]]’s Bash of Carson Daly (TV 2003) and the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] network's [[reality show]] ''[[30 Seconds to Fame]]''.

In 2005, she performed as part of the ''Abnormally Funny People'' show, with Steve Best, [[Liz Carr]], [[Steve Day]], [[Chris McCausland]] and Simon Minty. As part of the Edinburgh Festival Fringe the following year she appeared with Carr in ''Bravetarts''. In 2007 she performed her one-woman show ''Little Do They Know''. She then revamped the fringe show and had a six-month contract at the [[Clarion Hotel and Casino]] in [[Las Vegas]] in 2011.
 
In August 2013, Davis went back to the Edinburgh Fringe with her new one-person show "Big Trouble In Little 'Gina" which was based on a terrible medical ordeal starting at the end of 2012.

In 2011-2012 Davis was a series regular on the UK's [[Channel 4]] TV show ''[[I'm Spazticus]]''.

Davis was featured in a few British-produced programmes such as [[Sky (United Kingdom)|Sky TV]]'s documentary of the making of ''Abnormally Funny People'' as well as ITV's ''SuperHuman: World's Smallest People'' (which also aired on [[TLC (TV network)|TLC]] in the US). Her extensive spinal surgery was a focus in this show.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2008/jul/08/comedian-davis-wont-let-anything-keep-her-down/|title=Comedian Davis won’t let anything keep her down|date=2008-07-08|access-date=2016-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 August 2013, she appeared as a special guest on the live comedy Paralympics show ''[[The Last Leg]]'', discussing [[Jim Davidson]]'s comments about "midgets".

In 2015 she appeared on two major UK television shows, both on [[BBC]]. The first was ''[[The John Bishop Show]]'' - a variety show hosted by the top notch Liverpudlian, John Bishop. The second show was ''[[Live at the Apollo (TV series)|Live at the Apollo]]'' - with their first ever Christmas edition. Both sets were very well received according to social media.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}

On 15 July 2018, Davis was "harassed and humiliated" after a train guard for [[Great Western Railway]] attempted to force her to move her mobility scooter from a disabled space on the train. The guard made an announcement to the train passengers that she was "causing problems" and threatened to call the [[British Transport Police|police]] if she did not move and give her space to a woman with a pram. An investigation into the incident was begun by the rail company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-norfolk-44858107|title=Disabled comedian 'humiliated' on train|date=17 July 2018|publisher=|accessdate=18 July 2018|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-norfolk-44858107|title=Disabled comedian 'humiliated' on train|date=2018-07-17|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-07-17|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the 20 July 2018, Davis was left stranded on a train when staff at [[York railway station]] failed to arrive with a ramp, and the train departed for [[Darlington]], adding an hours delay to her journey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title =Tanyalee Davis: More train trouble for disabled comedian | work = | publisher =BBC | date =21 July 2018 | url =https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-norfolk-44910639 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
