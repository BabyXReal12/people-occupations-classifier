'''Roseanne Cherrie Barr''' (born November 3, 1952) is an American actress, comedian, writer, and television producer. Barr began her career in [[stand-up comedy]] at clubs before gaining critical and popular acclaim in the television sitcom ''[[Roseanne]]'' (1988–1997; 2018). She won both an [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] and a [[Golden Globe Award]] for Best Actress for her work on the show.

Barr was born into a Jewish family living in [[Salt Lake City, Utah]]. She became a standup comedian in 1980. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, she began to emerge as a celebrity through her role in ''[[Roseanne]]'' and other public performances. Barr sparked controversy when performing "[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]" at a nationally aired baseball game on July 25, 1990. After singing the anthem in what many perceived to be a deliberately disrespectful manner, Barr grabbed her crotch and spat. This performance was met with condemnation from baseball fans and sportswriters, and was called "disgraceful" by then-President [[George H. W. Bush]].&lt;ref name=Anthem&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2015/07/23/roseanne-on-the-day-she-shrieked-the-star-spangled-banner-grabbed-her-crotch-and-earned-a-rebuke-from-president-bush/ |title= Roseanne on the day she shrieked ‘The Star-Spangled Banner,’ grabbed her crotch and earned a rebuke from President Bush |date=July 23, 2015 |accessdate=May 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barr has been active and outspoken on political issues. She won nearly 70,000 votes for president in the general election of 2012, as the presidential nominee of the [[Peace and Freedom Party]].&lt;ref name="FEC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fec.gov/pubrec/fe2012/2012pres.pdf|title=2012 Presidential Popular Vote Summary for All Candidates Listed on at least one State Ballot|accessdate=November 6, 2016|author=Federal Election Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Donald Trump]] announced his candidacy for president in 2015, Kelly Weill of ''[[The Daily Beast]]'' wrote that Barr "veered right" in her politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/roseanne-keeps-promoting-qanon-the-pro-trump-conspiracy-theory-that-makes-pizzagate-look-tame|title=Roseanne Roseanne Keeps Promoting QAnon, the Pro-Trump Conspiracy Theory That Makes Pizzagate Look Tame|first=Kelly|last=Weill|date=March 30, 2018|publisher=|via=www.thedailybeast.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; After ''Roseanne'' was revived, Trump called her to congratulate her on her show's ratings and thank her for her support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/03/donald-trump-roseanne-call-ratings|title=Donald Trump Called Roseanne to Congratulate Her on His Favorite Thing: Huge TV Ratings|first=Yohana|last=Desta|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has frequently defended her support of Trump, and has been criticized for her extensive use of personal attacks, [[conspiracy theories]], and [[fake news]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/everything-that-led-to-abcs-roseanne-cancellation-2018-5|title=Every controversial step that led toward ABC's 'Roseanne' cancellation — from Pizzagate to Parkland to the final racist last straw|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--Please see [[Talk:Roseanne Barr|the talk page]] discussion before revising this specific section of the lede in regards to the racist tweet.--&gt;
''Roseanne'' was revived in 2018 on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]; the show was abruptly canceled on May 29, after being renewed for another season, due to Barr making a controversial [[Twitter|tweet]], which many called "racist" and she later called a "bad joke".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ABC drops Roseanne show after racist tweet|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-44294632|work=BBC News|date=29 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Roseanne Barr was born on November 3, 1952, in [[Salt Lake City, Utah]], to a Jewish family. She is the oldest of four children born to Helen (née Davis), a [[bookkeeping|bookkeeper]] and cashier, and Jerome Hershel "Jerry" Barr,&lt;ref name="heritage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genealogymagazine.com/roseannebarr.html|title=The Family Tree of Roseanne Barr|publisher=Genealogy Magazine|date=March 16, 2006|accessdate=February 16, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110203113806/http://genealogymagazine.com/roseannebarr.html|archivedate=February 3, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; who worked as a salesman.&lt;ref name="jjournal"/&gt; Her father's family were Jewish emigrants from Russia, and her maternal grandparents were Jewish emigrants from [[Austria-Hungary]] and [[Lithuania]].&lt;ref name="heritage"/&gt; Her paternal grandfather changed his surname from "Borisofsky" to "Barr" upon entering the United States.&lt;ref name="jjournal"&gt;{{cite web|last=Tugend|first=Tom|url=http://jewishjournal.com/news/los_angeles/la_woman/12864/|title=Roseanne Shares Secrets and Jibes |work=[[The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles]]|publisher=TRIBE Media Corp|date=March 23, 2006|accessdate=February 16, 2011|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xmZkhoNq?url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/la_woman/article/roseanne_shares_secrets_and_jibes_20060324/|dead-url=no|archivedate=April 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her Jewish upbringing was influenced by her devoutly [[Orthodox Jew]]ish maternal grandmother.&lt;ref name="jjournal"/&gt; Barr's parents kept their Jewish heritage secret from their neighbors and were partially involved in [[Latter-day Saints|The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]].&lt;ref name="jjournal"/&gt; Barr has stated, "Friday, Saturday, and Sunday morning I was a Jew; Sunday afternoon, Tuesday afternoon, and Wednesday afternoon we were Mormons."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Roseanne: My Life as a Woman |last=Barr |first=Roseanne |year=1989 |publisher=[[Harper (publisher)|Harper &amp; Row]] |isbn=978-0-06-015957-3 |pages=51–53 |url=http://www.ldsfilm.com/actors/Roseanne.html |accessdate=February 16, 2011|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xmZowEhp?url=http://www.ldsfilm.com/actors/Roseanne.html|dead-url=no |archivedate=April 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Barr was three years old, she got [[Bell's palsy]] on the left side of her face. Barr said, "[so] my mother called in a rabbi to pray for me, but nothing happened. Then my mother got a Mormon preacher, he prayed, and I was miraculously cured". Years later, Barr learned that Bell's palsy was usually temporary and that the Mormon preacher came "exactly at the right time".&lt;ref name="jjournal"/&gt;

At six years old, Barr discovered her first public stage by lecturing at LDS churches around Utah and was elected president of a Mormon youth group.&lt;ref name="jjournal"/&gt;

At 16, Barr was hit by a car; the incident left her with a traumatic brain injury.&lt;ref name="jjournal"/&gt; Her behavior changed so radically that she was institutionalized for eight months at [[Utah State Hospital]].&lt;ref name="PhiladelphiaDailyNews"&gt;{{cite journal|last= Gallagher|first=Maria|journal=[[Philadelphia Daily News]]|publisher=[[Philadelphia Media Network]]|title=Thin Roseanne? That's no joke Barr's story in 'My Life As a Woman'|date=September 26, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; While institutionalized she had a baby, which she put up for adoption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast

In 1970, when Barr was 18 years old, she moved out by informing her parents she was going to visit a friend in Colorado for two weeks, but never returned.&lt;ref name="PhiladelphiaDailyNews"/&gt;

==Career==

===Stand-up comedian: 1980–1986===
While in Colorado, Barr did stand-up gigs in clubs in Denver and other Colorado towns. She later tried out at [[The Comedy Store]] in Los Angeles and went on to appear on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' in 1985.&lt;ref name="PhiladelphiaDailyNews"/&gt;

In 1986, she performed on a [[Rodney Dangerfield]] special and on ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'' and the following year had her own [[HBO]] special called ''The Roseanne Barr Show'', which earned her an [[American Comedy Awards|American Comedy Award]] for the funniest female performer in a television special.&lt;ref name="SanFranciscoChronicle1988"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dykstra|first=Carol|journal=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|publisher=[[Hearst Corporation]]|title=Domestic Goddess Rules Her Own Show – Comedian Roseanne Barr turns housework into hilarity |date=October 16, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barr was offered the role of Peg Bundy in ''[[Married... with Children]]'' but turned it down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kelley|first=Bill|work=Sun-Sentinel|title=`Roseanne` A Quirky But Funny Sitcom|date=October 18, 1988|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1988-10-18/features/8803010607_1_roseanne-barr-paycheck-sitcom|accessdate=June 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her routine she popularized the phrase, "domestic goddess", to refer to a homemaker or housewife. The success of her act led to her own series on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], called ''[[Roseanne (TV series)|Roseanne]]''.

===''Roseanne'' sitcom, film, books, and talk show: 1987–2004===
{{Main|Roseanne}}
In 1987, ''[[The Cosby Show]]'' executive producers [[Carsey-Werner Productions|Marcy Carsey]] and [[Tom Werner]] wanted to bring a "no-perks family comedy" to television. They hired ''Cosby'' writer [[Matt Williams (producer)|Matt Williams]] to write a script about factory workers and signed Barr to play [[Roseanne Conner]].&lt;ref name="EW2008pg1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20235368,00.html|title=A 'Roseanne' Family Reunion – The behind-the-scenes truth about Roseanne Barr's groundbreaking sitcom|last=Stransky|first=Tanner|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|page=1|date=October 24, 2008|accessdate=February 17, 2011|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xmZxURct?url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20235368,00.html|archivedate=April 8, 2011|deadurl=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show premiered on October 18, 1988, and was watched by 21.4&amp;nbsp;million households, making it the highest-rated debut of that season.&lt;ref name="EW2008pg2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20235368_2,00.html|title=A 'Roseanne' Family Reunion – The behind-the-scenes truth about Roseanne Barr's groundbreaking sitcom|last=Stransky|first=Tanner|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|page=2|date=October 24, 2008|accessdate=February 17, 2011|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xma2UUNa?url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20235368_2,00.html|archivedate=April 8, 2011|deadurl=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barr became outraged when she watched the first episode of ''Roseanne'' and noticed that in the credits, Williams was listed as creator.&lt;ref name="EW2008pg2"/&gt; She told Tanner Stransky of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', "We built the show around my actual life and my kids. The 'domestic goddess', the whole thing".&lt;ref name="EW2008pg2"/&gt; In the same interview, Werner said, "I don't think Roseanne, to this day, understands that this is something legislated by the [[Writers Guild of America|Writers Guild]], and it's part of what every show has to deal with. They're the final arbiters."&lt;ref name="EW2008pg2"/&gt;

During the first season, Barr sought more creative control over the show, opposing Williams' authority. Barr refused to say certain lines and eventually walked off set. She threatened to quit the show if Williams did not leave. ABC let Williams go after the thirteenth episode.&lt;ref name="EW2008pg2"/&gt; Barr gave [[Amy Sherman-Palladino]] and [[Joss Whedon]] their first writing jobs on ''Roseanne''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/feb/25/entertainment/la-et-st-bunheads-sherman-palladino-20130225|title=Amy Sherman-Palladino Hopes 'Bunheads' Gets a Callback|date=February 25, 2013|accessdate=May 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nymag /&gt;

''Roseanne'' ran for nine seasons from 1988 to 1997. Barr won an [[Emmy Award|Emmy]], a [[Golden Globe]], a [[Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards|Kids Choice Award]], and three [[American Comedy Awards]] for her part in the show. Barr had crafted a "fierce working-class domestic goddess" persona in the eight years preceding her sitcom and wanted to do a realistic show about a strong mother "who was not a victim of patriarchal consumerism".&lt;ref name=nymag&gt;Barr, R. (May 15, 2011) [http://nymag.com/print/?/arts/tv/upfronts/2011/roseanne-barr-2011-5/ "And I Should Know"] ''New York Magazine''&lt;/ref&gt;

For the final two seasons, Barr earned $40 million, making her the second-highest-paid woman in show business at the time, after [[Oprah Winfrey]].&lt;ref name="slate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/id/1820/|last=Plotz|first=David|title=Domestic Goddess Dethroned|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|publisher=[[The Washington Post Company]]|date=May 18, 1997|accessdate=April 7, 2011|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xmazWlus?url=http://www.slate.com/id/1820/|archivedate=April 8, 2011|deadurl=no|quote=She's earned $40 million in the last two years, making her the second-highest-paid woman in show business, after [[Oprah]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Roseanne Barr at the 1992 Emmy Awards-cropped.jpg|thumb|left|Barr attending the [[44th Primetime Emmy Awards|1992 Emmy Awards]]]]

[[Barbara Ehrenreich]] called Barr a working-class spokesperson representing "the hopeless underclass of the female sex: polyester-clad, overweight occupants of the slow track; fast-food waitresses, factory workers, housewives, members of the invisible pink-collar army; the despised, the jilted, the underpaid",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ehrenreich|first=Barbara|date=April 2, 1990|title=The Undainty Feminism of Roseanne Barr|work=[[The New Republic]]|pages=28–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; but a master of "the kind of class-militant populism that the Democrats, most of them anyway, never seem to get right".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Taranto |first=James |date=August 1, 1990 |url=http://home.roadrunner.com/~taranto/roseanne.htm |title=Roseanne Barr: From Deification to Disgust |work=[[New York Tribune]] |accessdate=September 25, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/61yRWgp5w?url=http://home.roadrunner.com/~taranto/roseanne.htm |archivedate=September 26, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Barr refuses to use the term "blue collar" because it masks the issue of class.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, R.

During ''Roseanne''{{'}}s final season, Barr was in negotiations between [[Carsey-Werner Productions]] and ABC executives to continue playing [[Roseanne Conner]] in a spin-off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9500E0DE123DF937A35757C0A961958260 |title=Roseanne to Continue on TV But Is Expected to Leave ABC |last=Carter |first=Bill |work=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]] |date=April 4, 1997 |accessdate=February 17, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xmbmB6OA?url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9500E0DE123DF937A35757C0A961958260 |archivedate=April 8, 2011 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After failed discussions with ABC as well as [[CBS]] and [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], Carsey-Werner and Barr agreed not to continue the negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E05E1D8143CF93AA35757C0A961958260 |title=A Rest for Roseanne |last=Carter |first=Bill |work=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]] |date=April 9, 1997 |accessdate=February 17, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xmbrEUsq?url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E05E1D8143CF93AA35757C0A961958260 |archivedate=April 8, 2011 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She released her autobiography in 1989, titled ''Roseanne—My Life As a Woman''.&lt;ref name="Biography.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/roseanne-barr-9463817|title=Roseanne Biography (1952–)|publisher=[[Biography.com]]|accessdate=August 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, she made her film debut in ''[[She-Devil]]'', playing a scorned housewife, Ruth. Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] gave her a positive review saying, "Barr could have made an easy, predictable and dumb comedy at any point in the last couple of years. Instead, she took her chances with an ambitious project – a real movie. It pays off, in that Barr demonstrates that there is a core of reality inside her TV persona, a core of identifiable human feelings like jealousy and pride, and they provide a sound foundation for her comic acting".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19891208/REVIEWS/912080301 |title=She-Devil |last=Ebert |first=Roger |authorlink=Roger Ebert |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |publisher=[[Sun-Times Media Group]] |date=December 8, 1989 |accessdate=February 24, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xmbxue7Q?url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F19891208%2FREVIEWS%2F912080301 |archivedate=April 8, 2011 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, she voiced the baby Julie in ''[[Look Who's Talking Too]]''. She was nominated for a [[Golden Raspberry Award]] for [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actress|Worst Supporting Actress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.razzies.com/asp/content/XcNewsPlus.asp?cmd=view&amp;articleid=30 |title=1990 Archive |last=Wilson |first=John |publisher=Razzies.com |date=August 23, 2000 |accessdate=February 24, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xmc5oKWV?url=http://www.razzies.com/asp/content/XcNewsPlus.asp?cmd=view&amp;articleid=30 |archivedate=April 8, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She appeared three times on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' from 1991 to 1994, co-hosting with then-husband [[Tom Arnold (actor)|Tom Arnold]] in 1992.

Following her rendition, she mimicked the often-seen actions of players by spitting and grabbing her crotch as if adjusting a protective cup. Barr later said Padres had suggested she "bring humor to the song", but many criticized the episode, including [[President of the United States|President]] [[George H. W.

Barr repeatedly criticized [[Jill Stein]] after losing the Green Party nomination,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roseanneworld.com/blog/2012/10/green-party-misses-crucial-political-opp/|title=Green Party pres’l candidate misses crucial political opportunity by not talking up democracy in Israel/Palestine|accessdate=October 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roseanneworld.com/blog/2012/07/green-party-post/|title=Green Party Compromised|accessdate=October 29, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016075016/http://www.roseanneworld.com/blog/2012/07/green-party-post/|archive-date=October 16, 2012|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roseanneworld.com/blog/2012/10/dr-stein-needs-to-study-her-history/|title=Dr. Stein needs to Study her History|accessdate=October 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and caused controversy by using alleged [[transphobic]] words in statements about Stein on [[Twitter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.queerty.com/roseanne-barr-gets-into-twitter-twist-up-over-transgender-comments-20121026/|title=Roseanne Barr Gets Into Twitter Twist-Up Over Transgender Comments|accessdate=October 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after losing the Green Party nomination, Barr announced that she would run on the [[Peace and Freedom Party]] ticket with activist [[Cindy Sheehan]] as her [[running mate]].&lt;ref&gt;Abcarian, Robin (August 2, 2012) [http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-roseanne-barr-peace-and-freedom-party-candidate-20120802,0,3965135.story "Roseanne Barr: Peace and Freedom Party presidential candidate"], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. Retrieved August 3, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; On August 4, 2012, Barr won the presidential nomination of the Peace and Freedom Party.&lt;ref name="trending"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/08/05/america-one-step-closer-to-president-roseanne/ | title=TRENDING: America one step closer to President Roseanne | publisher=CNN | date=August 5, 2012 | accessdate=August 5, 2012 | author=Yoon, Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2012/08/roseanne-finally-won-a-presidential-nomination.html | title=Roseanne Barr Finally Won a Presidential Nomination | work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] | date=August 5, 2012 | accessdate=August 5, 2012 | author=Bankoff, Caroline}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barr's running mate, Cindy Sheehan, immediately had disagreements with Barr, from Barr's views on policy, to Barr's desire to only campaign online, and Barr's treatment of Green Party nominee [[Jill Stein]], leading Sheehan to request that her name be taken off the Peace and Freedom Party ticket. Sheehan was told it was too late to have her name removed, so she instead announced that she was would be leaving the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cindysheehanssoapbox.blogspot.com/2015/02/of-noodges-and-nukes-by-cindy-sheehan.html | title=Of Noodges and Nukes by Cindy Sheehan | work=Cindy Sheehan Official Site | date=February 12, 2015 | accessdate=June 12, 2016 | author=Sheehan, Cindy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cindysheehanssoapbox.blogspot.com/2012/09/no-longer-on-campaign-formal.html| title=No Longer on Campaign. Formal announcement | work=Cindy Sheehan Official Site | date=September 4, 2012 | accessdate=June 12, 2016 | author=Sheehan, Cindy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barr appeared on the ballot in California,
Colorado, and Florida. She did not appear on the ballot in her home state of Hawaii, which did not allow write-in votes. She ended up voting for President [[Barack Obama|Obama]]. She received 67,326 votes nationwide, placing sixth overall with 0.05% of the popular vote; Stein, who appeared on the ballot of thirty-six states and the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], placed far ahead of her in fourth place with 0.36% of the popular vote and 469,627 votes.&lt;ref name="FEC"/&gt;

Barr was followed by a film crew throughout her entire campaign, with documentarian [[Eric Weinrib]] directing, leading to questions about the sincerity of her campaign. Over 300 hours were filmed and were released as a film called ''Roseanne for President!''. Despite questions of her sincerity regarding her campaign, Barr and her family have insisted her desire to run for president was "very real."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://variety.com/2015/film/reviews/tribeca-film-review-roseanne-for-president-1201475205/| title=Tribeca Film Review: ‘Roseanne for President!’ | work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=April 18, 2015 | accessdate=June 12, 2016 | author=Kenigsberg, Ben}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/roseanne-barr-presidential-campaign-doc-708579| title=Roseanne Barr Presidential Campaign Doc in the Works (Exclusive) | work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] | date=June 2, 2014 | accessdate=June 12, 2016 | author=Siegel, Tatiana}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2015/04/17/tribeca-film-festival-2015-roseanne-for-president-explores-the-alternative-party-system/| title=‘Roseanne For President!’ Explores the Alternative Party System | work=[[Wall Street Journal]] | date=April 17, 2015 | accessdate=June 12, 2016 | author=Ayers, Mike}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://thelaughbutton.com/features/time-roseanne-ran-president/| title=That time Roseanne ran for President | work=The Laugh Button | date=May 31, 2016 | accessdate=June 12, 2016 | author=Mark Says Hi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Support for Donald Trump===
Barr voiced her support for Republican presidential candidate [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|Donald Trump]] in a June 2016 ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' interview. "I think we would be so lucky if Trump won. Because then it wouldn't be [[Hillary Clinton|Hillary]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ross|first1=Tracy |title=Roseanne Barr on Trump "Playing the Heel for Hillary," Pot and Being a Farmer|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/roseanne-barr-us-would-be-900413 |accessdate=September 15, 2016|agency=Hollywood Reporter|date=June 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A July [[CNN]] story reported she did not endorse Trump as she only supports herself for president—"I will be writing myself in&lt;!--not a mistake--&gt; in every election from now until I win."&lt;ref name="cnn"&gt;{{cite news|last1=France|first1=Lisa Respers|title=Roseanne Barr denies she's a Trump supporter|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/01/entertainment/roseanne-barr-trump/|accessdate=September 15, 2016|agency=CNN|date=July 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
