'''Gabriel Weston Kaplan''' (born March 31, 1945) is an American [[comedian]], actor, poker commentator, and professional [[poker]] player.&lt;ref&gt;US Search [http://preview.ussearch.com/preview/ala/newsearch?adID=10002101&amp;searchtab=people&amp;searchFName=gabe&amp;searchMName=&amp;searchLName=kaplan&amp;searchCity=los+angeles&amp;searchState=&amp;searchApproxAge=65&amp;x=39&amp;y=24 "Gabe Kaplan"]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kaplan was born in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. He is best known for his role as Gabe Kotter in the 1970s sitcom, ''[[Welcome Back, Kotter]]''. He later became known as a poker player, and as co-host and joint commentator for the series ''[[High Stakes Poker]]'' on [[Game Show Network|GSN]].

==Early life==
Kaplan was born in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]], to a [[Jewish]] family.&lt;ref&gt;http://jewishjournal.com/wandering_jew/12053/celebs-stick-to-their-tzedakah-box-job/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acting career==
As a kid, Kaplan had aspirations of being a [[Major League Baseball]] player. However&lt;!--after two years (OF WHAT?)--&gt;, he was unable to make the roster of a minor league team and decided to pursue other interests. He began working as a [[bellhop|bellman]] at a hotel in [[Lakewood, New Jersey|Lakewood]], [[New Jersey]]. Touring comedians would sometimes perform at the hotel, and Kaplan began to work toward his own career as a [[stand up comedy|stand-up comedian]]. Gabe honed his standup routine in 1964 in places such as the Cafe Tel Aviv at 250 West 72nd Street, New York City.

Kaplan's comedy was successful, and he toured the country with his act based on his childhood experiences in Brooklyn. He appeared five times on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' from May 1973 to December 1974. During that time, he also recorded the comedy album ''Holes and Mello-Rolls,'' which included long routines about his high school days, among other topics. The sitcom ''[[Welcome Back, Kotter]]'', whose central characters he helped Eric Cohen and Alan Sacks create and whose core format he helped them to develop, was in part based on his comedy act. In the sitcom, Kaplan played Gabe Kotter, who returns as a teacher to the dysfunctional high school where he had been a student. The series ran from 1975–79, and Kaplan bought a home in [[Palm Springs, California]] with his earnings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Meeks|first1=Eric G.|title=The Best Guide Ever to Palm Springs Celebrity Homes|date=2012|publisher=Horatio Limburger Oglethorpe|isbn=978-1479328598|page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Up your nose with a rubber hose!", sanitized from the original album line "Up your hole with a Mello-Roll!", became an unlikely catchphrase from the show. It became so popular that a comedy record by Kaplan, ''Up Your Nose'', was released by [[Elektra Records]]. The record, co-written and -produced by Kaplan, dented the [[Billboard Hot 100]] in January 1977, peaking at #93.

From 1976–78 and again in 1981, Kaplan participated in the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] celebrity athletic competition ''[[Battle of the Network Stars]]''. For the first five competitions, Kaplan was the captain of the ABC network team. In the very first competition, Kaplan defeated [[Robert Conrad]], who was participating in the event representing the [[National Broadcasting Company|NBC]] team as its captain, in a race much to Conrad's chagrin. Kaplan, who was 31 at the time, passed Conrad, then 40, with a strong sprint to the finish line, giving ABC television network the win with 175 points. In 1981, Kaplan returned to the competition as the team captain for the NBC side, as he was appearing in the NBC TV show ''[[Lewis &amp; Clark (TV series)|Lewis &amp; Clark]]''.

After ''Welcome Back, Kotter'', Kaplan continued with his stand-up act and was in several movies, including a starring role in ''[[Fast Break (film)|Fast Break]]'' in 1979; and portrayed comic [[Groucho Marx]] in a one-man show.

==Poker==

Kaplan became involved in financial markets and poker during his acting career. He made his first appearance at the [[World Series of Poker]] in 1978. In 1980, Kaplan was considered one of poker's elite, as he won the main event at [[Amarillo Slim]]'s [[Super Bowl of Poker]] and was presented with "a loving cup that was so enormous it made the gaudy gold bracelets given to the winners at the World Series of Poker look understated."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pokernews.com/news/2009/03/poker-vaults-amarillo-slim-super-bowl-poker-1197.htm|title=From the Poker Vaults: Amarillo Slim's Super Bowl of Poker, Part I|publisher=PokerNews|last=Reback|first=Storm|date=2009-03-05|accessdate=March 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next five years his reputation was solidified as he made the final table at the Super Bowl's main event two more times.

In July 2004, he finished third in a [[World Poker Tour]] no-limit [[Texas hold 'em]] event, earning more than $250,000. He also finished second in the [[2005 World Series of Poker]] $5,000 Limit Hold 'Em event, winning $222,515. Kaplan was joint TV commentator for the 1997 and 2002 [[World Series of Poker|WSOP]] events. In 2007, Kaplan won on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Poker After Dark]]'' in the episode "Queens and Kings" after defeating [[Kristy Gazes]] heads-up and outlasting [[Howard Lederer]], [[Ali Nejad]], [[Vanessa Rousso]] and [[Annie Duke]] in a $20,000 buy-in 6 person No-Limit Texas Hold-Em winner-take-all Sit-and-Go.

In the [[2007 World Series of Poker]] Kaplan finished in ninth place in the $50,000 World Championship [[HORSE]] [[2007 World Series of Poker results#Event 39|event]], winning $131,424. As of June 2017, Kaplan's total live tournament winnings were reported to be $1,991,248.&lt;ref name="HENDON"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gabe Kaplan|url=http://pokerdb.thehendonmob.com/player.php?a=s&amp;n=14510|website=The HENDON MOB|publisher=Mediarex Enterprises Ltd.|accessdate=9 June 2017|ref=HENDONlink}}&lt;/ref&gt; His eleven cashes at the WSOP were reported to be $539,159 of those winnings.&lt;ref name="WSOPKaplan"&gt;{{cite web|title=WSOP Player Profile &amp;ndash; Gabe Kaplan|url=http://www.wsop.com/players/profile/?playerID=164|website=WSOP.com|publisher=Caesars Interactive Entertainment, Inc.|accessdate=9 June 2017|ref=WSOPKaplanLink}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kaplan won again on ''[[Poker After Dark]]'' during "Cowboys" week that first aired in February 2008 against [[Chris Ferguson]], [[Andy Bloch]], [[Chau Giang]], [[Hoyt Corkins]] and [[Doyle Brunson]]. Gabe Kaplan's ''[[Poker After Dark]]'' win in the first week of the 2010 season (the "Commentators III" episode) was the greatest comeback in the show's history.&lt;ref name="msnbc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/34782190/ns/sports-poker_on_nbc |title=Poker After Dark: Commentators III recap – Poker on NBC- NBC Sports |publisher=web.archive.org |accessdate=December 5, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101207034436/http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/34782190/ns/sports-poker_on_nbc |archivedate=December 7, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later activities ==
Kaplan resumed performing stand-up comedy and worked on adaptations of ''[[Welcome Back, Kotter]].'' He still plays poker frequently and became a commentator for poker events and televised poker shows, including the ''[[National Heads-Up Poker Championship]]'' on [[NBC]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117962825.html?categoryid=14&amp;cs=1 "NBC's 'Heads-Up' aces ratings"] Variety.com, retrieved April 15, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[High Stakes Poker]]'' on [[Game Show Network|GSN]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gsn.com/corporate/press.php?release_id=251 "High Stakes Poker Season 3 Premieres on Monday, January 15 at 9 PM"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070507002025/http://www.gsn.com/corporate/press.php?release_id=251 |date=2007-05-07 }} GSN.com retrieved April 15, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Intercontinental Poker Championship]] on [[CBS]].

In 1995, His name was mentioned in the episode 21 "[[The PTA Disbands]]" sixth season of [[the Simpsons]] as a substitute teacher in Bart's class.

In 2007, he appeared in [[Zak Penn]]'s improvisational comedy, ''[[The Grand (film)|The Grand]]'', as Seth Schwartzman, father of brother-and-sister poker players. Also in 2007, Kaplan published a book titled ''Kotter's Back: E-mails from a Faded Celebrity to a Bewildered World''.&lt;ref name=book&gt;Kaplan, Gabe. ''Kotter's Back: E-mails from a Faded Celebrity to a Bewildered World'' (Simon and Schuster, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; In the book, people react to absurd e-mailed claims by Kaplan, such as that he:&lt;ref name=book /&gt;

* has slept with more women than [[Wilt Chamberlain]]
* is an expert at [[Hopak|Cossack dancing]]
* thinks he's smart enough to become a member of [[Mensa International|Mensa]]
* would like [[NASA]] to send him into orbit with [[Jimmy Carter]] and [[Julius Erving|Dr. J]]

The book also describes his e-mails:&lt;ref&gt;Zerschling, Lynn. "A prank that will pay off", ''[[Sioux City Journal]]'' (July 3, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

* to the Athens Olympic Committee offering to light the [[Olympic torch]]
* to [[American Automobile Association|AAA]] (the auto club) about signing up for [[Alcoholics Anonymous]]
* to the makers of [[Metamucil]] suggesting it feature constipated celebrities in its TV ads
* to the [[Postmaster General]] offering to have his picture on a stamp.

In January 2011, GSN announced that [[Norm Macdonald]] would replace Kaplan as host of ''[[High Stakes Poker]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Slagter, Josh. [http://blog.mlive.com/deadmoney/2011/02/not_funny_gsn_gabe_kaplan_out.html "Not funny, GSN: Gabe Kaplan out as 'High Stakes Poker' host, replaced by Norm MacDonald"], ''[[Grand Rapids Press]]'' (February 8, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;
