Commenting on her childhood, she stated: "I would say [we were] lower-middle-class, but I feel like my mom would start crying if she heard that. But my dad was a used car dealer and my mother worked in a locksmith shop as the bookkeeper, and then they got divorced, and I do remember, like, nuns bringing us food—like big canned goods. And then, you know, we didn't really go on vacation–ever... I had so many jobs growing up: I mowed lawns; I worked at a grocery store; I had two newspaper routes; I worked at a catering place... I definitely hustled."&lt;ref name=forbes&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/russespinoza/2017/06/15/predatory-lending-may-be-responsible-for-natasha-leggeros-career/#5b9919a3e53f|work=Forbes|title=Frustrated To Fabulous: The Humble Beginnings Of Natasha Leggero|author=Espionza, Russ|date=June 15, 2017|accessdate=June 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Year's Eve incident===
On December 31, 2013, Leggero was criticized for a joke she made during NBC's ''[[New Year's Eve with Carson Daly]]'', when, in response to a controversial [[Twitter|tweet]] posted by [[SpaghettiOs]] on the anniversary of the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor attack]], she quipped: "It sucks that the only survivors of Pearl Harbor are being mocked by the only food they can still chew." Her remarks were met with a backlash over social media; in response, Leggero posted in a blog entry that she did not feel that "the amazing courage of American veterans and specifically those who survived Pearl Harbor is in any way diminished by a comedian making a joke about [[dentures]] on television. Do we really believe that the people who fought and defended our freedom against [[Nazi]]s and the [[Axis powers]] will find a joke about Spaghetti O's too much to bear? Sorry, I have more respect for Veterans than to think their honor can be impugned by a glamorous, charming comedian in a fur hat." She also called on those offended by the remarks to donate to [[Disabled American Veterans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/tv/tv-highlights-networks-compete-for-most-entertaining-new-years-show/2013/12/30/3826f0fa-715a-11e3-8def-a33011492df2_story.html|author=Rachel Lubitz|title=TV highlights: Networks compete for most entertaining New Year’s show|work=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=January 6, 2014|date=December 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Margaret Eby|title=Comedian Natasha Leggero responds to controversy over World War II veteran joke: 'I'm not sorry|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/comedian-natasha-leggero-responds-controversy-world-war-ii-veteran-joke-article-1.1566225|work=[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]|date=January 4, 2014|accessdate=January 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Drew Grant|title=Comedian Natasha Leggero is Sorry/Not-Sorry About SpaghettiO-Gate|url=http://observer.com/2014/01/comedian-natasha-leggero-is-sorrynot-sorry-about-spaghettio-gate/|work=[[The New York Observer]]|accessdate=January 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comedic style==
Leggero's comedy has been characterized as [[observational comedy|observational]],&lt;ref name=hesse&gt;{{cite web|work=Westword|url=http://www.westword.com/arts/the-ten-best-comedy-shows-in-april-5812679|title=The ten best comedy shows in April|accessdate=October 4, 2017|author=Hesse, Josiah M.|date=March 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; with frequent commentary on [[celebrity]] culture and class.&lt;ref name=hesse/&gt; Her approach to standup has been noted for its heavy use of [[persona]], which largely relies on costumes and "an air of mock-refinement and elitism."&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt; Journalist John Wenzel wrote that Leggero's use of persona "[allows her to] indict the most bloated, superficial aspects of our culture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Wenzel, John|work=The Know|title=Why So Serious, Natasha Leggero?|date=November 15, 2010|accessdate=August 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maggie Lange of ''[[GQ]]'' noted:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
All performers have a character to some extent, but Leggero is one of the few with a costume. She’s like a wolf in sheep’s clothing, but like a seasoned comedian in socialite’s clothing. She’s always been this way. Who is the most formally dressed being at every ''Roast''? Natasha Leggero. Who is perhaps the only person to have ever worn long white gloves to the [[Laugh Factory]]? Natasha Leggero. It’s always like she’s going to another party. While other comedians are trying to out-casual each other, she’s sitting with impeccable posture, dripping diamonds, dripping disdain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[GQ]]|title=Nobody in Comedy Commits Like Natasha Leggero|author=Lange, Maggie|url=https://www.gq.com/story/nobody-commits-like-natasha-leggero|date=August 21, 2015|accessdate=December 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
