'''Malcolm Hardee''' (5 January 1950 – 31 January 2005)&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/obituaries/story/0,,1405432,00.html|title= Obituary: Malcolm Hardee| work=The Guardian | location=London | first=William | last=Cook | date=4 February 2005 | accessdate=12 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an English comedian, author, [[comedy club]] proprietor, [[Master of Ceremonies|compère]], [[Talent agent|agent]], [[Talent manager|manager]] and "amateur [[sensationalist]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,,1408261,00.html|title= Guardian, 8 February 2005 | work=The Guardian | location=London | date=8 February 2005 | accessdate=12 May 2010 | first=Alex | last=Games}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His high reputation among his peers rests on his outrageous [[publicity stunt]]s and on the help and advice he gave to successful British [[Alternative comedy|alternative comedians]] early in their careers, acting as "godfather to a generation of comic talent in the 1980s".&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fellow comic [[Robert Newman (comedian)|Rob Newman]] called him "a hilarious, [[Anarchism|anarchic]], living legend; a millennial [[Falstaff]]",&lt;ref name="ISFMBC front quotes"&gt;Hardee, Malcolm: "I Stole Freddie Mercury's Birthday Cake" (pub Ebury Press, 1996), pre-title page&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Stewart Lee]] wrote that "Malcolm Hardee is a natural clown who in any decent country would be a national institution"&lt;ref name="ISFMBC front quotes" /&gt; and [[Arthur Smith (comedian)|Arthur Smith]] described him as "a South London [[François Rabelais|Rabelais]]"&lt;ref name="ISFMBC front quotes" /&gt; and claimed that "everything about Malcolm, apart from his stand-up act, was original".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/features/feature.php/6717 |work=The Stage |date=1 March 2005 |title=Letter to a Young Comedian |accessdate=2 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though an accomplished comic, Hardee was arguably more highly regarded as a "character", a compère and talent-spotting booker at his own clubs, particularly The Tunnel Club in [[Greenwich, London|Greenwich]], [[South East (London sub region)|South East London]], which gave vital and early exposure to up-and-coming comedians during the early years of British alternative comedy.&lt;ref name="Independent obit"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.independent.co.uk/people/obituaries/article13691.ece |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130420223646/http://news.independent.co.uk/people/obituaries/article13691.ece |dead-url=yes |archive-date=20 April 2013 |title=Malcolm Hardee |work=The Independent |location=London |date=5 February 2005 |accessdate=12 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In its [[obituary]], ''[[The Times]]'' opined that "throughout his life he maintained a fearlessness and an indifference to consequences"&lt;ref name="Times"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article511345.ece|work= The Times |location=London |date=7 February 2005 |accessdate=12 May 2010 |first=David |last=Byers}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one journalist claimed: "To say that he has no shame is to drastically exaggerate the amount of shame that he has".&lt;ref name="Times" /&gt; In a publicity quote printed in Hardee's autobiography ''I Stole Freddie Mercury's Birthday Cake'', Arthur Smith wrote that Hardee had "led his life as though for the perfect autobiography and now he has paid himself the compliment of writing it."&lt;ref name="ISFMBC front quotes" /&gt;

== Early life ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Malcolm Hardee autobiography.jpg|thumb|Hardee's 1996 autobiography]] --&gt;
Hardee was born in Lewisham, South East London, near the [[River Thames]], and came from a long line of [[lightermen]]&lt;ref name="Telegraph" /&gt; who earned their living on [[Tugboat|tugs]] pulling [[barges]] on the river. He was the eldest son of Frank and Joan Hardee, spent his first two years in an [[orphanage]] while his mother was in hospital with [[tuberculosis]]&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt; and was educated at three South East London schools – [[St Stephen]]'s [[Church of England]] primary, [[Colfe's School]], and [[Sedgehill]] [[Comprehensive school|comprehensive]].&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt;

Expelled from the later two schools he drifted into petty crime&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt; – stealing [[Coca-Cola]] from a local bottling plant, burgling a pawnbrokers&lt;ref name="Chortle"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2005/02/02/3494/malcolm_hardee_dies|title= news page on UK comedy industry website Chortle, 2 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and setting fire to a [[Sunday school]] piano because he wanted to see "holy smoke".&lt;ref name="Times" /&gt; He served prison sentences for [[cheque fraud]], burglary and escaping custody;&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/london/4230789.stm|work= BBC News | date=2 February 2005 | accessdate=6 January 2010 |title=Comedian's body found in Thames}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1967, he escaped from [[Gaynes Hall]] [[Borstal]] dressed as a [[monk]].&lt;ref name="Times" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Scotsman"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also had [[convictions]] for arson and once infamously stole a [[Rolls-Royce (car)|Rolls Royce]]&lt;ref name="Telegraph" /&gt; which he believed belonged to British cabinet minister [[Peter Walker, Baron Walker of Worcester|Peter Walker]]. (Walker later wrote to Hardee after reading about this widely reported story and denied it had been his car.)&lt;ref&gt;Hardee, Malcolm: "I Stole Freddie Mercury's Birthday Cake" (pub Ebury Press, 1996), page 65&lt;/ref&gt;

Hardee decided to turn to showbusiness as a way of staying out of trouble, saying: "There are only two things you can do when you come out of prison and you want immediate employment. You can either be a [[minicab]] driver or you can go into showbusiness"&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; and "Prison is like [[mime]] or [[juggling]] – a tragic waste of time".&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt;

== Acts and stunts ==

After coming out of prison in 1977 or 1978 (sources vary), Hardee joined Martin Soan's [[The Greatest Show on Legs]] – at the time, a one-man adult [[Punch and Judy]] act.&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt; Revamped as a [[Surreal humor|surreal]] [[Sketch comedy|sketch]] group, The Greatest Show on Legs became a regular at the Tramshed venue in [[Woolwich]], alongside the likes of [[Rik Mayall]] and [[Ade Edmondson]].&lt;ref name="Chortle" /&gt; Soon afterwards, in 1979, [[The Comedy Store, London|The Comedy Store]] opened in [[Soho]] and The Greatest Show on Legs became regulars there, too.&lt;ref name="Times" /&gt; Their breakthrough came in 1982, when they performed their naked balloon dance on [[Chris Tarrant]]'s anarchic late-night TV show ''[[O.T.T.]]''.&lt;ref name="Telegraph" /&gt;

In 1987, as one of his many publicity stunts, Hardee stood for [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] in the famous [[Greenwich by-election, 1987]], as the "[[Rainbow Dream Ticket]], Beer, Fags &amp; [[Skittles (game)|Skittles]] Party" candidate, polling 174 votes.&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt; He then stood again in the 1992 election in order to publicise his comedy club because the election rules allowed him a free mail shot to all registered voters in the [[constituency]].&lt;ref name="Telegraph" /&gt;

Hardee regularly appeared in his own shows at the [[Edinburgh Fringe]]. The Greatest Show on Legs debuted there in 1982.&lt;ref name=Venables170711&gt;
{{cite web |title=How Comedy Captured the Edinburgh Fringe: Part 3 |last=Venables |first=Ben |publisher=[[The Skinny (magazine)|The Skinny]] |url=http://www.theskinny.co.uk/comedy/opinion/how-comedy-captured-the-edinburgh-fringe-part-3 |date=6 June 2017 |access-date=13 October 2017}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Arguably his most infamous confirmed stunt there was in 1983 when, performing at The Circuit venue – a series of three adjoining tents in a construction site with a different show in each tent – he became annoyed by what he regarded as excessive noise emanating nightly from [[Eric Bogosian]]'s neighbouring performance tent. Hardee obtained a nearby [[tractor]] and, entirely naked, drove it across Bogosian's stage during his performance.&lt;ref name="Borkowski"&gt;{{cite news |author=Mark Borkowski |url=https://www.theguardian.com/edinburghfestival2001/story/0,,529703,00.html|title=Weird is not enough |work=The-Guardian |date= 30 July 2001 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Oldie]]'' – issue 192 – March 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Venables170711/&gt; Rivalling this stunt in Fringe infamy, in 1989, Hardee and Arthur Smith wrote a rave 5-star review of Hardee's own Fringe show and successfully managed to get it printed in ''[[The Scotsman]]'' under the [[byline]] of the influential newspaper's comedy critic.&lt;ref name="Scotsman" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://media.guardian.co.uk/columnists/story/0,,1280093,00.html|title= PR stunts: an expert's guide| work=The Guardian | location=London | first=Mark | last=Borkowski | date=10 August 2004 | accessdate=12 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the Fringe in 1996, ''[[The Independent]]'' reported that he attempted to sabotage American [[ventriloquist]] [[David Strassman]]'s Edinburgh show by [[Kidnapping|abducting]] the act's [[hi-tech]] dummy, holding it to [[ransom]] and sending it back to Strassman piece by piece in return for hard cash. The plan failed.&lt;ref&gt;Wareham, Mark: "Legends of the Comedy Terrorist", Independent, 21 August 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:HardeeGlastonbury2003.jpg|left|thumb|Hardee at the [[Glastonbury Festival 2013|2003 Glastonbury Festival]]]]
Perhaps the most-quoted anecdote concerning Hardee was that, on 9 October 1986&lt;ref name="FunnyTalk"&gt;ed Driver, Jim: "Funny Talk" (pub The Do-Not Press, 1995), pages 123–127&lt;/ref&gt; his house was searched by the police – who were looking for crumbs – two days after&lt;ref name="FunnyTalk" /&gt; he and others stole [[Freddie Mercury]]'s £4,000&lt;ref name="Telegraph" /&gt; 40th birthday cake. No crumbs were found at the house as he had already by then donated the cake to a local [[nursing home]].&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FunnyTalk" /&gt; He used this incident as the title of his 1996 autobiography ''I Stole Freddie Mercury's Birthday Cake'' which he wrote with John Fleming. In another encounter with the police, Hardee was once questioned by [[Special Branch]] officers after being found on the balcony outside government minister [[Michael Heseltine]]'s hotel room, wearing nothing but a pair of socks and a leather coat containing £5,200 in cash and a pack of pornographic playing cards. He had mistaken the room for that of a friend.&lt;ref name="flemingblog"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thejohnfleming.wordpress.com/2011/01/18/the-weird-daily-life-of-comedian-malcolm-hardee-and-after/ |title=The weird daily life of comedian Malcolm Hardee – and after &amp;#124; SO IT GOES – John Fleming's blog |publisher=Thejohnfleming.wordpress.com |date=18 January 2011 |accessdate=2012-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Collaborator John Fleming said of him that "At home, he occasionally put a live goldfish in his mouth to get attention – I saw him do it twice. It was often said of Malcolm, with a lot of justification, that he never had a stage act – his life was his act."&lt;ref name="flemingblog" /&gt;

In his autobiography, Hardee claimed he was the first to attempt the '[[firecracker|banger]]-up-the-[[buttocks|bum]]' routine, later perfected and performed by Greatest Show on Legs co-star Chris Lynam, in which a [[firework]] (occasionally a three-stage [[Roman candle (firework)|Roman Candle]]) was clenched between the buttocks and lit to a recording of [[Ethel Merman]] singing "[[There's No Business Like Show Business (song)|There's No Business Like Show Business]]".&lt;ref&gt;Hardee, Malcolm: "I Stole Freddie Mercury's Birthday Cake" (pub Ebury Press, 1996), page 160&lt;/ref&gt;

The claim for which Hardee was arguably best known throughout his performing life was that he was said to have "the biggest bollocks in show business"&lt;ref name="Independent obit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Time Out Munnery"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.timeout.com/london/comedy/features/2486/Simon_Munnery_on_Malcolm_Hardee.html|title= 'Simon Munnery on Malcolm Hardee' |work=Time Out |date=12 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he became renowned for a rarely performed but vividly unforgettable act in which he would use his own [[glasses|spectacles]] atop his [[genitals]] to create a unique visual [[Impressionist (entertainment)|impression]] of [[President of France|French President]] [[Charles de Gaulle]] with his [[testicles]] representing the politician's cheeks; this act pre-dated the Australian show ''[[Puppetry of the Penis]]'' by several years.&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Telegraph" /&gt;

Hardee rarely appeared on television, though he did play minor roles in six ''[[The Comic Strip|Comic Strip]]'' TV films and one episode in the first series of ''[[The Black Adder|Blackadder]]''.&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt;

== Clubs ==
[[File:BalloondanceWiki.gif|thumb|The Greatest Show on Legs' Balloon Dance]]
Hardee was also renowned as a talent spotter and owner of clubs which gave vital early exposure to up-and-coming comedians&lt;ref name="Independent obit" /&gt; including [[Charlie Chuck]], [[Alan Davies]], [[Harry Enfield]], [[Harry Hill]], [[Paul Merton]], [[Vic Reeves]], [[Frank Skinner]], [[Johnny Vegas]]&lt;ref name="Standard"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-16342292-details/Comedian+found+dead/article.do;jsessionid=Y32pG1KcL1WdPxwK2wx5PsbTX1nYj6wPnQsLrtQGc1VSQqkChJ60!1557838166!-1407319225!7001!-1|title= London Evening Standard, 3 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jo Brand]], with whom he had a two-year affair&lt;ref name="Telegraph" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Standard" /&gt; and whom he persuaded to become a comedian.&lt;ref name="Scotsman" /&gt; He hosted the first-ever outing of the [[new circus]] group [[Ra-Ra Zoo]], who performed comedy mime to a, for once, silenced audience. He also worked for a time as the manager of [[Jerry Sadowitz]]&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt; and was an occasional promoter and tour manager for his friend and neighbour [[Jools Holland]].&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt;

His most infamous venue&lt;ref name="Time Out Munnery" /&gt; was The Tunnel Club, which he opened in 1984&lt;ref name="Independent obit" /&gt; next to the southern exit from the [[Blackwall Tunnel]] in Greenwich, South East London. He would sometimes introduce inexperienced stand-ups to audiences with the nerve-jangling line: "This next act's probably a bit shit"&lt;ref name="Times" /&gt; but, once their performance was finished, he would often comfort those he thought showed promise with backstage words of encouragement and urge them to try again. His advice to comics who were concerned that a joke might be offensive to an audience was: "If you think it’s funny, then fuck ’em."&lt;ref name="Times" /&gt;

[[File:Upthecreek.gif|left|thumb|Up The Creek comedy club, Greenwich, 2007]]
At his weekly ''Sunday Night at the Tunnel Palladium'' shows, sometimes even experienced and accomplished comedians failed to complete a whole set against the unforgiving crowd and razor-sharp [[Heckler|heckling]].&lt;ref name="Time Out Munnery" /&gt; When the club became established, it attracted groups of men apparently from the suburb of  [[Eltham]] who Hardee referred to as 'Herberts'. They  were usually drunk and attending the Tunnel club as it offered after hours drinks on a Sunday night, a rarity back then. They usually ended the evening by fighting, fortunately usually between themselves, leaving everybody else as spectators. It was at the Tunnel Club that comedian [[Jim Tavare]] once began his act with the unwise opener, "Hello, I'm a [[schizophrenic]]" – to be met with the lightning rejoinder from a heckler in that night's audience, "Well, you can both fuck off then!".&lt;ref name="Times" /&gt; [[Julian Clary]] together with Fanny the Wonder dog were surprising hits at such evenings.

The Tunnel closed in 1988&lt;ref name="Independent obit" /&gt; and, in 1991, Hardee opened the Up The Creek comedy club in Creek Road, Greenwich.&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt; In an upstairs bar at the club was a [[mural]] commissioned by Hardee as a [[parody]] of [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo)|The Last Supper]]''. It showed Hardee as Christ with Jo Brand, [[Julian Clary]] and other famous British comedians as the [[Twelve Apostles|Disciples]] including [[Ben Elton]] as [[Judas Iscariot]].&lt;ref name="Chortle Inquest"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2005/06/20/790/he_died_with_a_beer_in_his_hand?PHPSESSID=304|title= report on UK comedy industry website Chortle, 20 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Times Last Supper"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesonline.typepad.com/faith/2008/01/the-latest-last.html|title=Photo of Hardee's 'Last Supper' in The Times Online, 8 January 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081015201936/http://timesonline.typepad.com/faith/2008/01/the-latest-last.html|archivedate=15 October 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001,&lt;ref name="Telegraph obit"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2005/02/04//db0402.xml&amp;sSheet=/portal/2005/02/04/ixportal.html|title= Daily Telegraph obituary, 4 February 2005 | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | accessdate=12 May 2010 | first=Andrew | last=Haldenby}}&lt;/ref&gt; after he sold his percentage in Up The Creek, Hardee took over a floating [[pub]], The Wibbley Wobbley, on a converted Rhine pleasure cruiser in [[Greenland Dock]], [[Rotherhithe]], by the River Thames.&lt;ref name="Telegraph obit" /&gt;

== Death and legacy ==
[[File:FuneralWreaths.jpg|thumb|Wreaths at Hardee's funeral]]
On 2 February 2005, Hardee's body was recovered from Greenland Dock, after he was reported missing from The Wibbley Wobbley on 31 January; he had been last seen late-night on 30 January. A post-mortem soon confirmed he had drowned. In an inquest at [[Southwark]] [[Coroner's Court]] on 20 July, Coroner John Sampson recorded a verdict of accidental death. It had been assumed in several reports of his death that, while trying to make his way home by dinghy from The Wibbley Wobbley to his houseboat ''The Sea Sovereign'' just fifteen yards away&lt;ref name="Telegraph" /&gt; across Greenland Dock, Hardee had lost his balance and drowned while drunk. But the Coroner found that, whilst attempting to access ''The Sea Sovereign'' from the quayside, Hardee had fallen into the dock while drunk.&lt;ref name="LifeStyleExtra"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lifestyleextra.com/ShowStory.asp?story=JG2015528B&amp;news_headline=drowned_comic_was_still_clutching_his_beer|title=LifeStyleExtra, 20 July 2005|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713204434/http://www.lifestyleextra.com/ShowStory.asp?story=JG2015528B&amp;news_headline=drowned_comic_was_still_clutching_his_beer|archivedate=13 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:HackneyAdWikipedia.gif|left|thumb|Flyer for 2006 memorial show]]
Police constable Martin Spirito told the court that, on 2 February: "The search commenced at 10:00{{nbsp}}am. At 10:24{{nbsp}}am one of the officers came up and said he had found a lifeless body. I followed the officer's line down. Six metres down I saw a white male. The male had a bottle of beer clenched in his right hand." Police sergeant Roy Dawson, in charge of overseeing the dive, told the court: "The bottle was held in his right hand. It fell from his hand on the ascent."&lt;ref name="LifeStyleExtra" /&gt;
