While working on the animated series ''[[Rocko's Modern Life]]'', Kenny met marine biologist and animator [[Stephen Hillenburg]], who was also the creative director in the show's fourth season.

To voice the character of SpongeBob, Hillenburg approached Kenny. Hillenburg chose the name SpongeBob and used the name SquarePants as a family name that "had a nice ring to it".
