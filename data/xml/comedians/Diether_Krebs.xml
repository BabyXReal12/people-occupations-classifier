'''Diether Krebs''' (11 August 1947 in [[Essen]], [[Germany]] – 4 January 2000 in [[Hamburg]]) was a German [[actor]], [[cabaret]] artist and [[comedian]].

==Life and career==

===Youth and initial success===

Diether Krebs was born on 11 August 1947 in Essen, the son of a [[stationery]] shop owner. His [[Godparent|godfather]] was [[Diether Posser]], a lawyer, [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] politician and erstwhile Minister for Justice and Finance for [[North Rhine-Westphalia]]. Krebs gained his first experience in the theatre at school at the Humboldt ''[[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]]'' in Essen. He took acting lessons at the renowned "[[Folkwang Hochschule|Folkwangschule]]" school of [[performing arts]] in the [[Ruhrgebiet]] and took on his first role at the theatre in [[Oberhausen]], followed by some small film roles. Of these, his most noteworthy appearance was in the film ''[[Zoff (film)|Zoff]]'' (1971) in which he played alongside well-known actors such as [[Jürgen Prochnow]] and [[Claus Theo Gärtner]].

From 1973, Krebs became famous for his role as "Michael Graf" in the legendary [[German television comedy|comedy series]] ''[[Ein Herz und eine Seele]]'', the German version of ''[[Till Death Us Do Part]]''. Krebs played the same role as [[Antony Booth|Tony Booth]]'s Mike, the left-wing son-in-law of Alfred Tetzlaff ([[Alf Garnett]]), played by [[Heinz Schubert (actor)|Heinz Schubert]]. In 1974, however, he left the series due to differences with the producers [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk|WDR]].

In the time that followed, Krebs made many television appearances, both in light entertainment and in more sophisticated series. In 1975, Peter Zadek chose him to play in ''[[Ice Age (1975 film)|Eiszeit]]'' with [[Heinz Bennent]]; in 1980 he played a main role in ''[[Die Judenbuche]]'' based on the story by [[Annette von Droste-Hülshoff]].

===Detective thrillers===

In 1978, Krebs turned to [[crime]] series: for eight years, from 1978 to 1986, he played "Dieter Herrle", the miserable chief detective in the series ''[[SOKO 5113]]''. He made several guest appearances in the classic detective series ''[[Tatort]]'', as well as in the famous ''[[Polizeiruf 110]]'' and ''[[Der Alte (television series)|Der Alte]]''.

===Comedian and cabaret artist===

Krebs achieved more success as a cabaret artist and comedian: in 1981, he made regular appearances on ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Rudis Tagesshow|de}}'' with [[Rudi Carrell]], alongside Beatrice Richter and [[Klaus Havenstein]]. This poked fun at the main news programme, the ''[[Tagesschau (Germany)|Tagesschau]]'', and caused a good deal of uproar. Krebs left his series, again because of disagreements with the producer ([[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]]).

From 1985 to 1987 Krebs achieved [[cult]] status with his comedy series ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Sketchup (Comedy)|de|3=Sketchup (Comedy)|lt=Sketchup}}'' in which he took on a wide range of different roles, accompanied at first by [[Beatrice Richter]] and then by [[Iris Berben]]. The series also became popular in other countries, such as [[Belgium]]. This series, followed by ''Knastmusik'' (1990) and ''Lauter nette Nachbarn'' (also 1990) built up Krebs's reputation as a comedian.

===Actor, singer and presenter===

In the years that followed, Diether Krebs acted in roles of varying quality. In 1986 he played the hairdresser "Hupsi" in [[Helmut Dietl]]'s successful series ''[[Kir Royal – Aus dem Leben eines Klatschreporters]]''; in 1993 he took on a role in the [[catastrophe film]] ''Möbius'' by Matti Geschonneck. In 1991 he acted as a long-distance driver in the comedy ''[[Go Trabi Go]]'' by [[Peter Timm]]. That same year, he entered the German [[music charts]]: for a while he became famous as "Martin", a naive [[Environmentalism|tree-hugger]] in a hand-knitted [[Fair Isle (technique)|Fair Isle]] jumper with straggly hair and prominent teeth. He also played this character on stage.

Krebs also worked as a [[television presenter]], for example hosting the New Year Gala on [[Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk|MDR]] from 1996 and the ''Goldene Henne'' media award ceremony in 1999, also on MDR.

===Hard times and a comeback===

The last years of Diether Krebs's life were marked by his dwindling success and serious illness. In 1993, the [[RTL Television|RTL]] show ''R.O.S.T. - Die Diether Krebs-Show'', which also starred [[Hugo Egon Balder]], was cancelled after thirteen episodes. The [[Sat.1]] comedy series ''Der Dicke und der Belgier'' with the [[Flemish people|Flemish]] comedian [[Carry Goossens]] was also cancelled in 1998 due to low [[viewing figure]]s.

Krebs was a strong smoker and by then he was suffering from lung cancer.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/leute/erinnerungen-an-diether-krebs-der-alleswoller-a-499064.html&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, at this time, he developed a new character which he played on stage: "Herr Krups", a funny sales rep with horn-rimmed glasses and wonky teeth. In 1998 he set off on a tour, starting in [[Berlin]], with a routine including his own version of the [[Ruhrgebiet]]'s ode to [[Currywurst]]. The text of this song which  [[Herbert Grönemeyer]] made famous was written by Krebs.

===His last role===
In 1999, Diether Krebs played his last role in the Ruhrgebiet-based action comedy film ''[[Bang Boom Bang]]''. Playing slimeball [[shipping agent]] Werner Kampmann he appeared alongside [[Ralf Richter (actor)|Ralf Richter]] and others in this film directed by {{Interlanguage link multi|Peter Thorwarth|de}}. Some film critics acclaimed this as Krebs's best ever part. Krebs was also scheduled to act in the longer cinema version of the film but died 8 month earlier from lung cancer.
