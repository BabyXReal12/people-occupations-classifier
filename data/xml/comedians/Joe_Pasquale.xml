'''Joseph Ellis Pasquale''' (born 20 August 1961) is an English comedian, actor and television presenter, known for being crowned "King of the Jungle", in the [[I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! (UK series 4)|fourth series]] of ''[[I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! (UK TV series)|I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!]]'' in 2004.

In January 2013, Pasquale became one of twelve celebrities participating in the [[Dancing on Ice (series 8)|eighth series]] of ''[[Dancing on Ice]]'', with skating partner [[Vicky Ogden]]. The following year Pasquale participated in the show again in an ''All Stars'' series. This time he was partnered with [[Robin Johnstone (figure skater)|Robin Johnstone]].

Pasquale is known for the naturally high pitch of his voice which he uses to heighten the comic value of his jokes.

He has also hosted the revived version of the game show ''[[The Price Is Right (UK game show)|The Price is Right]]''.

==Early life==
Pasquale attended Torells Comprehensive School, [[Grays]], Essex.&lt;ref name=Mail&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2020278/Me-school-photo-Joe-Pasquale-reminisces-abut-repercussions-breaking-leg-13.html|title=Me and my school photo: Joe Pasquale reminisces abut the repercussions of breaking his leg at 13 – Daily Mail Online|work=Daily Mail|accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked for the [[Civil Service (United Kingdom)|Civil Service]]'s [[Department for Transport|Department of Transport]] before joining the [[Smithfield, London#Market|Smithfield meat market]]. The hours at the meat market became too much for a young Pasquale, so he left to work at a building site and as a spot welder at the Ford factory in [[Dagenham]].

==Entertainment career==
For a few years, Pasquale worked as an entertainer at holiday camps across the UK and became entertainment manager at [[Bourne Leisure|Warner Holidays]] in [[Corton, Suffolk|Corton]] in Suffolk. Later, he became entertainment manager at [[Torquay]]. His big break arrived when he entered and came second in the ''[[New Faces]]'' competition in 1987.

===Stage===
Pasquale's live shows include ''Live And Squeaky'' (1996), ''Twin Squeaks'' (1997), ''The Crazy World of Joe Pasquale'' (1998), ''Bubble And Squeak'' (2000), ''The Everything I Have Ever Done &amp; The First of Many Goodbye Tours'' (2004), ''Does He Really Talk Like That? The Live Show'' (2005) and ''Return of the Love Monkey'' (2006).

He has done six [[Royal Variety Performance]]s, most recently in 2005. Pasquale once described how he got drunk one night causing the other performers to avoid him for the entire evening. The situation worsened when the Queen greeted the performers, including Pasquale, who was the 'most drunk' he had ever been.

In recent years Pasquale has begun acting on stage. In 1999, he appeared as a lead character in ''The Nerd.'' The show received rave reviews with one source describing it as "rib shatteringly funny". He returned to the stage in Autumn 2004 in the comedy ''Tom, Dick and Harry''.

On 9 December 2001, during the first (and only) annual MuppetFest celebration, Pasquale performed on [[The Muppet Show]] Live which was staged at the Hollywood Palace in Hollywood. [[The Great Gonzo]] introduced him, saying...

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Hello, again. Y'know, one of favorite things about "The Muppet Show" was giving a break to talented newcomers. Tonight, we'd like to continue that tradition by introducing someone I recently discovered in England. This is his first appearance in America...and with your help, it can be his last. Ladies and Gentleman, the astounding and baffling Joe Pasquale!''.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;Pasquale performed in the [[Mel Brooks]] West End musical [[The Producers (musical)|''The Producers'']] as Leo Bloom on a UK tour in 2007. He also played the role of King Arthur in [[Monty Python]]'s ''[[Spamalot]]'' making his [[West End theatre|West End]] musical debut at the [[Playhouse Theatre]] and on UK tour from 2013 to 2015. 

From spring 2018 he will play Frank Spencer on a UK tour in a stage adaptation of ''[[Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em]]''.

===Reality TV===
On 6 December 2004 he won the fourth series of the United Kingdom television show ''I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!''. Pasquale overcame competition from [[butler]] [[Paul Burrell]] and [[nightclub]] owner [[Fran Cosgrave]]. During his time in the jungle, Pasquale had a relationship with the two [[emu]]s and became famous for his use of the term "Jacobs" (for Jacobs Crackers: a [[rhyming slang]] term for [[testicles]]). He was the first celebrity to earn full stars in a [[bushtucker]] trial. The special trial involved Pasquale climbing out of an airborne helicopter and climbing down a ladder recovering the stars as he went. Later on in the show, Pasquale found himself being buried underground for five minutes with [[rat]]s in a trial called ''Danger Down Under''. Before doing the show, Pasquale made his worries about doing the show clear.  He insisted it wouldn't be the bushtucker trials that worried him, rather the other 'celebrities'. He claimed to be terrible and shy when it came to meeting new people and was worried about them not liking him. For the 16-day duration of the show, Pasquale was the bookies' favourite to win.

In January 2013, Pasqaule became one of twelve celebrities participating in the [[Dancing on Ice (series 8)|eighth series]] of ''[[Dancing on Ice]]'', with skating partner [[Vicky Ogden]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itv.com/dancingonice/contestants/joe-pasquale/]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121222162525/http://www.itv.com/dancingonice/contestants/joe-pasquale/|date=22 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were eliminated on 10 February, claiming sixth place.

In January 2014, the final series of ''[[Dancing on Ice]]'' began airing on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]. To celebrate this it was confirmed that the series was to be an "All-Stars" series, bringing back some of the past contestants including Pasquale who has been partnered with professional skater [[Robin Johnstone (figure skater)|Robin Johnstone]]. This time, however Joe and Robin were eliminated in the first week after losing the skate-off to [[Bonnie Langford]].

In 2017 he took part in ITV's ''[[Sugar Free Farm]]''.

===Live performances===
On 24 September 2005, the 30-minute Breakout Trust DVD, entitled "It's a Boy", was published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.breakout.org.uk/|title=The Breakout Trust: Pioneering Evangelism through the ministry of Steve Legg|publisher=Breakout.org.uk|accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pasquale starred as the voice of an Innkeeper named Garralus. Alongside him were such performers as [[Cannon and Ball]], and [[Cliff Richard|Sir Cliff Richard]]. The production is a new take on the [[Nativity play|nativity]] story and was released in time for Christmas 2005.

During 2005, Pasquale toured the United Kingdom with his summer tour, ''Does He Really Talk Like That?!'' which is the name of his autobiography which released in September 2006. The DVD of Pasquale's 2005 tour was released in time for Christmas 2005.

Pasquale toured during 2006 with a new show ''The Return of the Love Monkey'' that was filmed in [[Southend]], Essex, for a new DVD and that was shown on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] in 2007.

In late 2010, Joe took to the road again for his "Extra Sensory Pasquale" live show.

===Allegations of plagiarism===
In 2005, [[Stewart Lee]] accused Joe Pasquale of stealing the opening line from his Royal Variety performance from [[Michael Redmond (comedian)|Michael Redmond]]. Lee further alleged that Pasquale sent his writers to the performances of alternative comedians to copy their jokes. Lee incorporated his criticisms of Pasquale into his ''90's Comedian'' stage show.

===Other work===
Pasquale wrote the musical stage version of ''[[Rentaghost]]'' which toured the UK in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rentaghostthemusical.com/|title=アークテリクスのタウンユースバッグカタログ|publisher=Rentaghostthemusical.com|accessdate=26 December 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141221215558/http://www.rentaghostthemusical.com/|archivedate=21 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He performed the voice of a rat in ''[[Garfield: A Tail of Two Kitties|Garfield 2]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0455499/fullcredits|title=Garfield 2 (2006) : Full Cast &amp; Crew|publisher=IMDb|accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pasquale also provides the voice over for [[Underdog (TV advert character)|Underdog]], the cartoon dog mascot of personal injury firm [[National Accident Helpline]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Underdog returns to challenge the perceived complexity of claims|url=http://www.national-accident-helpline.co.uk/about-us/news/press/underdog-books-tv-ad/|work=National Accident Helpline|publisher=National-accident-helpline.co.uk|accessdate=6 January 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107174951/http://www.national-accident-helpline.co.uk/about-us/news/press/underdog-books-tv-ad/|archivedate=7 January 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 November 2017, Pasquale published his book of short horror stories titled ''Deadknobs and Doomsticks''.

==Charity work==
With the help of other celebrities, Pasquale backed the Man Alive 2005 campaign.  The campaign, which was run by [[Cancer Research UK]], aimed to alert men to the dangers of being overweight and to encourage exercise. The main danger highlighted by the campaign was that [[obesity]] and physical inactivity can cause cancer in men, and that the cancer caused by obesity may be prevented by a healthy diet and regular exercise.

Pasquale has also supported other charities including [[Diabetes UK]].

==Personal life==
Pasquale has overcome his fear of flying, and has now gained a pilot's licence. He is studying Earth Sciences at the [[Open University]] and was hoping to graduate with a BSc degree in 2014.&lt;ref name=OU&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.open.ac.uk/about/showcase/article/the-ou-comedian-joe-pasquales-midlife-crisis|title=The OU is comedian Joe Pasquale's midlife crisis|publisher=Open.ac.uk|accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
