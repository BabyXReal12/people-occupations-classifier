In 2005 Lipari started performing at [[Gotham Comedy Club]], where he began working with [[Eddie Brill]], [[Greg Giraldo]], [[Cooper, Rego]], [[Jim Mendrinos]], [[Amy Schumer]], and [[Jessica Kirson]].

The show was a late night Friday night show at [[Comix NY|Comix Comedy Club]] in New York City's [[Meat Packing District]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Official Site|url=http://www.joelipari.com/?p=1463|dead-url=yes}}{{dead link|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a sold out ''Something Awesome'' [[Greg Giraldo]] told Lipari that he thought the story Lipari told on stage would make a fun movie idea and Lipari should write a script. After Giraldo's advice Lipari wrote a script for the short film that would later be called ''Dream Job.''{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

After doing stand-up about becoming a [[yoga]] teacher at New York City's [[Gotham Comedy Club]], Lipari was approached by a casting associate who was looking for a "sarcastic yogi". After a few questions Lipari was cast in ''[[Eat, Pray, Love]]'', starring [[Julia Roberts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Times of India|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-09-19/news-interviews/28067400_1_yoga-class-julia-roberts-tara-stiles | work=The Times of India | date=September 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lipari wrote, produced and directed the short film, ''Dream Job'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IMDB|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1956481/|work=IMDB}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a thesis project for The [[New York Film Academy]]'s one-year filmmaking program.

In 2012, Lipari began teaching a [[DIY]] : No Budget Filmmaking workshop at the [[Improv Olympic]] in Hollywood ([[I.O. West]]) and [[The People's Improv Theater]] in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IO West Official Site|url=http://ioimprov.com/west/performers/instructors#instructor_916|dead-url=yes}}{{dead link|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The PIT NYC|url=http://thepit-nyc.com/section/no-budget-filmmaking/|dead-url=yes}}{{dead link|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 7-week workshop, Lipari helps a small group of filmmakers write manageable scripts and produce 5- to 10-minute short films on limited time, money and resources.

New Year's Weekend 2015, Lipari took part in the [[Guinness World Records]] record breaking 60-hour Variety Show at [[New York City]]'s [[Metropolitan Room]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Theater Mania |url=http://www.theatermania.com/new-york-city-theater/news/the-metropolitan-room-breaks-world-record-for-long_71192.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Metropolitan Room |url=http://metropolitanroom.com/event.cfm?cart&amp;id=179517}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 Lipari worked on season 2 of [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]]/[[Netflix]] show ''[[Jessica Jones (TV series)|Jessica Jones]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IMDB |url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3565825/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and accepted a position as a Senior Creative Manager for the [[Brooklyn Nets]]' front office in the Global Marketing division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BK Nets Website |url=http://www.nba.com/nets/brooklyn/front_office_brooklyn}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{fv|date=July 2018}}

When his schedule permits, Lipari is a regular at top comedy venues including [[The Improv]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= The Improv Official Site|url=http://improv.com/comedian.cfm?id=1559|dead-url=yes}}{{dead link|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Jon Lovitz]] Comedy Club,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Jon Lovitz Club Official|url=http://thejonlovitzcomedyclub.com/comedian.cfm?id=1559|dead-url=yes}}{{dead link|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Ice House (comedy club)|The Ice House]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Ice House |url=http://icehousecomedy.com/comedian.cfm?id=1559}}&lt;/ref&gt;   [[Gotham Comedy Club]], [[Carolines on Broadway]], [[The People's Improv Theater]] and [[I.O.

== Terrorism ==
After being frustrated with the customer service at an [[Apple Store]], in September 2009, Lipari jokingly paraphrased a quote from the book/movie [[Fight Club (film)|''Fight Club'']], which referred to use of firearms, on his Facebook page. In under 2 hours, [[NYPD]] [[SWAT]] arrived at his door and, after searching his apartment, they brought Lipari to the station to be questioned by [[Homeland Security]].&lt;ref name=bencalhoun /&gt;

Lipari spent a year in court clearing his name of all charges, even turning down multiple plea bargains. Eventually The City of New York dropped all charges, including making terrorist threats and disorderly conduct. Since then Lipari has received offers from lawyers pushing him to sue New York City for wrongful imprisonment, but he has no plans to sue. When Emily Epstein from [[Metro New York]] pressed him as to why, he replied "I'd rather be rich on my own accord, not by suing the people who are just trying to keep us safe."&lt;ref name=metrony&gt;{{cite web|title=Joe Lipari: The poster child for Internet stupidity?|url=http://www.metro.us/newyork/local/article/902097--joe-lipari-the-poster-child-for-internet-stupidity|first1=Emily Anne|last1=Epstein|dead-url=yes|archive-url=http://archive.li/hIFR#selection-1211.0-1211.52|archive-date=2012-08-04|date=2011-06-27|publisher=[[Metro New York]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His story was first covered by ''[[This American Life]]''&lt;ref name=bencalhoun&gt;{{cite web|last=Calhoun|first=Ben|title=Right to Remain Silent|url=http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/414/right-to-remain-silent?act=1|publisher=This American Life|accessdate=September 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; in September 2010. It was also a cover story for ''[[Metro New York]]''&lt;ref name=metrony/&gt; and featured in Britain's daily newspaper ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite news|last=Kennedy|first=Maev|title=Twitter Joke Trial...|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/sep/24/twitter-joke-trial-bomb-threat|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=September 24, 2010|location=London|date=September 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lipari appears in the documentary ''[[Terms and Conditions May Apply]]'' alongside [[Moby]], [[Orson Scott Card]] and an ambush of [[Mark Zuckerberg]], the documentary premiered at [[Sundance Film Festival|Sundance]]. Lipari also appeared w/ [[John Stossel]] on the [[Fox News]] special "Policing America".&lt;ref name=FoxNews&gt;{{cite web|title=Fox News|url=http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2014/07/23/conservatives-libertarians-and-liberals-should-all-worry-about-militarization.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In light of the [[NSA]]/[[Edward Snowden]] controversy, Lipari created the [[White House]] [[petition]] to designate June 9 "Everyone Is a Suspect" Day.&lt;ref name=WhiteHouse.Org&gt;{{cite web|title=Petition|url=http://wh.gov/l3lxJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;
