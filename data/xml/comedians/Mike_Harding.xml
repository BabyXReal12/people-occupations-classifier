==Biography==
Harding's father, Louis Arthur "Curly" Harding, a navigator in the [[RAF]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mikeharding.co.uk/recordings/bombers-moon/ Mike Harding official website – Bomber's Moon info], retrieved 28 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/2766739 Commonwealth War Graves Commission entry for Louis Arthur Harding], retrieved 19 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt; was killed in the [[Second World War]], a few weeks before his son's birth.&lt;ref name="AMG"&gt;{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p477306/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=Biography by Steven McDonald |publisher=Allmusic.com |accessdate=18 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harding is of Irish ancestry on his mother's side.&lt;ref name="Harding"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mikeharding.co.uk/biog/biog.htm |title=accessed March 2009 |publisher=Mikeharding.co.uk |accessdate=6 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509064608/http://www.mikeharding.co.uk/biog/biog.htm |archivedate=9 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was educated at St Anne's, Crumpsall, and [[St Bede's College, Manchester]]. After a varied career as a road digger, dustbin man, schoolteacher, [[steel erector]], [[bus conductor]], boiler scaler and chemical factory worker, he took a degree in English and Education at the [[Victoria University of Manchester|University of Manchester]].&lt;ref name="AMG"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/shows/harding/biography.shtml |title=Radio 2: Mike Harding |publisher=BBC  |date=6 May 2009 |accessdate=6 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harding began performing as a [[folk singer]] and as a member of several local Manchester bands in the 1960s, making his first recordings for the [[Topic Records|Topic]] label. He began telling jokes between songs, eventually extending them into longer humorous anecdotes which became the main focus of his act. He released his first album, ''A Lancashire Lad'', in 1972, followed by ''Mrs 'Ardin's Kid'' in 1974. In 1975, the single release of "The Rochdale Cowboy", reached #22 in the [[UK Singles Chart]], and brought him national attention.&lt;ref name="AMG"/&gt;&lt;ref name="British Hit Singles &amp; Albums"/&gt;

As a stand-up comic he made several series for the [[BBC]] and appeared on numerous television and radio programmes, including two series of travel films in [[Ireland]] and the [[Appalachian Mountains]] of America. He also played [[rock and roll]] with his band, the Stylos, with the Lowe Brothers. He has had many albums and singles released, whilst the latter included "Man 'nited Song".

As well as comedy, he has released albums of serious songs, most notably ''Bombers' Moon'', the title track of which tells of his father's death.&lt;ref name="AMG"/&gt; The album also includes "The [[Accrington Pals]]" and cover versions of [[Bruce Springsteen]]'s "Factory" and [[Eric Bogle]]'s "[[And the Band Played Waltzing Matilda]]".

Harding composed the music scores for ''[[Danger Mouse (1981 TV series)|DangerMouse]]'', ''[[Count Duckula]]'' (he also sang the main and end titles with [[Manchester]] native Doreen Edwards), ''[[The Reluctant Dragon (1987 film)|The Reluctant Dragon]]'' and ''[[The Fool of the World and the Flying Ship]]'' for [[Cosgrove Hall Films]].

As well as being an acclaimed musician and comedian, he wrote ''The Armchair Anarchist's Almanac'', a humorous A to Z book; two collections of anecdotes, jokes and songs entitled ''The Unluckiest Man in the World'' and ''The 14½ Pound Budgie''; and a comedy/thriller/fantasy, ''Killer Budgies''.

His other books include a series covering aspects of his interest in British [[English folklore|folklore]] and history – ''The Little Book of the [[Green Man]]'', ''The Little Book of [[Stained Glass]]'', ''The Little Book of [[Gargoyles]]'', and ''The Little Book of [[Misericords]]''; and the loosely factual autobiography, ''You Can See the Angel's Bum, Miss Worswick!'' He has also read two of his short stories for ''Afternoon Story'' on [[BBC Radio 4]].&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; In 1986, Harding wrote the foreword to [[Barry Pilton]]'s book, ''[[One Man and His Bog]]''.

He more recently made a series of fourteen short films on minority religions in England for the BBC's ''Heaven and Earth'' show. Harding has presented the annual [[BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards]], and from 1997 to 2012 he presented the weekly [[BBC Radio 2]] flagship folk and roots programme, ''The Mike Harding Show''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/17/bbc-radio-mike-harding?newsfeed=true |title=BBC Radio 2 folk DJ Mike Harding hits out at boss after sacking |first=John |last=Plunkett |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=17 October 2012 |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |accessdate=17 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His last show was on 26 December 2012. According to [[Mark Radcliffe]], who took over Radio 2's ''Folk Show'', Harding had left reluctantly, claiming that the BBC had "sold the folk world down the river".&lt;ref&gt;Mark Radcliffe, interview with Pete Paphides in ''Radio Times'', 15–21 February 2014. Radcliffe recalled that he contacted Harding about his appointment and that he was "utterly decent about it".&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 Harding launched his own internet radio show, broadcast at 5pm every Sunday and available as a podcast and on [[iTunes]] afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mikehardingfolkshow.com/ |title=The Mike Harding Folk Show |accessdate=14 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This show went on hiatus in October 2017 after 252 regular episodes, although a special episode #253 was then published in December; further episodes continue to be released more sporadically.

Harding is a dedicated [[hillwalking|hillwalker]] and a former president, and now life vice president of the [[Ramblers' Association]].&lt;ref name="Harding"/&gt; He wrote, until a new format was sought for the magazine in 2008, a regular column for hiking magazine ''The Great Outdoors'' and campaigned for '[[Right of public access to the wilderness|Right to Roam]]' legislation in the United Kingdom.
 
He is one of the patrons of the [[Wensleydale Railway]], a group set up to re-open the once mainly derelict line between [[Northallerton]] and [[Garsdale]] in Yorkshire, near where he now lives.&lt;ref name="IMDb"/&gt;

He is also the patron of Settle Stories, a charity based in Settle, North Yorkshire, that promotes traditional storytelling and runs the annual Settle Storytelling Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cumbriacrack.com/2011/10/04/new-high-profile-patron-for-settle-stories/ |title=New high profile patron for Settle Stories : Cumbria Crack: News for Penrith, Eden Valley, Keswick, Workington, Whitehaven, Maryport, Barrow, Kendal, Carlisle, Lake District &amp; Cumbria |publisher=Cumbria Crack |date=4 October 2011 |accessdate=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harding contributed to a promotional leaflet for the Settle tourist board.
