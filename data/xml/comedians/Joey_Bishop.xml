They had one son, [[Larry Bishop]], a film director and actor. Drafted into the US Army in World War II, he rose to sergeant in the [[Special Services (entertainment)|Special Services]] serving at [[Fort Sam Houston]], Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1566737/Joey-Bishop.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Joey Bishop | date=2007-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==


Bishop began his career as part of a stand-up comedy act with his elder brother, Maury.  He  appeared on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' on May 28, 1950, ''[[The Dinah Shore Chevy Show]]'' on April 19, 1957, and many other variety programs in the early days of television. He guest-hosted ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' substituting for [[Jack Paar]], and then guest-hosted ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' at least 175 times in the 1960s, and from 1971–76 more than anyone else until that time ([[Jay Leno]] and [[Joan Rivers]] later surpassed his record).  He also frequently appeared on [[Steve Allen]]'s and [[Jack Paar]]'s previous versions of ''[[The Tonight Show]]''. He later had his own late night show.

[[File:Joey Bishop-publicity.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Appearing on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'', 1975]]
He starred in the [[situation comedy]] ''[[The Joey Bishop Show (sitcom)|The Joey Bishop Show]]'' that premiered on September 20, 1961 and ran for four seasons, first on [[NBC]] and later [[CBS]]. Bishop played a [[talk show]] host named Joey Barnes. His wife was portrayed by [[Abby Dalton]], who joined the cast in 1962.

He later hosted a 90-minute late-night talk show, also titled ''[[The Joey Bishop Show (talk show)|The Joey Bishop Show]]'', that was launched by [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] on April 17, 1967 as competition to Carson's ''Tonight Show'' and ran until December 26, 1969. His sidekick was then-newcomer [[Regis Philbin]].

Bishop was among the stars of the original ''[[Ocean's 11 (1960 film)|Ocean's 11]]'' film about military veterans who reunite in a plot to rob five Las Vegas casinos on New Year's Eve. He co-starred with [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Dean Martin]], [[Sammy Davis, Jr.]] and [[Peter Lawford]] of the so-called Rat Pack, although the five of them did not publicly acknowledge that name. During filming, the five entertainers performed together on stage in Vegas at the [[Sands Hotel]]. Bishop did only a little singing and dancing, but he told jokes and wrote most of the act's material. He later appeared with Sinatra, Martin, Davis, and Lawford in the military adventure ''[[Sergeants 3]]'', a loose remake of ''[[Gunga Din]]'', and with Martin in the western comedy ''[[Texas Across the River]]'', in which he portrayed an Indian.

Bishop was the only member of the Rat Pack to work with members of a younger group of actors dubbed the [[Brat Pack (actors)|Brat Pack]], appearing (as a ghost) in the 1990 film ''[[Betsy's Wedding]]'' with [[Molly Ringwald]] and [[Ally Sheedy]].

His final appearance in a film was a non-speaking role in ''[[Mad Dog Time]]'', written and directed by his son Larry. His character was named Gottlieb, which was Bishop's real surname.

Bishop was portrayed by [[Bobby Slayton]] in the 1998 [[HBO]] film ''[[The Rat Pack (film)|The Rat Pack]].''

==Death==

Bishop's wife of 58 years, Sylvia died of cancer in 1999. Thereafter, Bishop was in failing health for some time, and died of multiple organ failure on October 17, 2007 in his home on Lido Isle, a man-made island in the harbor of [[Newport Beach, California|Newport Beach]], [[California]].&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/19/arts/18cnd-bishop.html | newspaper=[[New York Times]] | title=Joey Bishop, 'Rat Pack' Comic, Dies at 89 | author=Richard Severo | date=October 19, 2007 |quote=Joey Bishop, the long-faced comedian and the last surviving member of the Rat Pack, Frank Sinatra’s celebrated retinue of the 1960s, died Wednesday night at his home in Newport Beach, Calif. He was 89. His death was of multiple causes, said his longtime publicist, Warren Cowan. ... | accessdate=2010-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was 89. He was survived by his son and daughter-in-law, Larry and Tania, two grandsons, Kirk and Scott, and a longtime companion Nora Garibotti. At the time of his death, Bishop was the longest-lived and the last surviving member of the [[Rat Pack]], as well as the only member to survive into the 21st century. Per his wishes his remains were cremated and scattered in the Pacific Ocean near his home.

The [[Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia]] posthumously inducted Bishop into their Hall of Fame in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://broadcastpioneers.com|title=Our Hall of Fame 2009|publisher=Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia|accessdate= 25 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
