'''Eddie Ifft''' (born 1974 in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]]) is an American [[stand-up comedian]], [[actor]] and writer.

==Biography==
Ifft graduated with honors from [[Fox Chapel Area High School]] in 1992. After graduation from the University of Pittsburgh, where he was a brother of the [[Delta Tau Delta]] fraternity and competed in track and field, he moved to [[New York City]], New York, US, and commenced performing stand-up comedy on the club circuit.

===Stand-up comedy===

Ifft was called "one of the most underrated comics in America" by [[The Onion]]'s [[The A.V. Club]].{{Citation needed|reason=cannot find this quote anywhere on The A.V. Club's site.|date=January 2018}} He has performed on many stand-up comedy specials, including [[Comedy Central]]'s ''[[Presents]], ''NBC's ''Late Friday Night'', BET's ''Comic View'', ABC's ''Comics Unleashed'', NBC's ''[[Last Comic Standing]]'', and in July 2001 he performed at the Montreal [[Just for Laughs]] Festival in ''New Faces''.  In August 2008 he filmed his own 1/2 hour special for Comedy Central (''[[Comedy Central Presents]]'').

One of a few American comedians to tour globally, Ifft has toured the UK and Australia extensively.  His comedy has been performed in over 20 countries in theatres, clubs and television shows.  In Australia he has been featured on ''[[Rove (TV series)|Rove Live]]'', ''[[The Glass House (2001 TV series)|The Glass House]]'', ''[[The NRL Footy Show|The Footy Show]]'', ''[[Stand Up Australia]]'', ''[[Wil &amp; Lehmo]]'', ''[[The Sideshow]]'',  ''[[Thank God You're Here]]'', ''[[Good News Week]]'', ''[[The Circle (TV program)|The Circle]]'', and ''[[Spicks and Specks (TV series)|Spicks and Specks]]''.

In June 2007 he taped his first live DVD at the [[Sydney Opera House]] to a sold-out crowd. He has recorded three live stand-up comedy specials: ''I Learned the Hard Way'' (2004), ''Jokes That Make My Friends Laugh'' (2006), and ''Live from Australia'' (2009), produced by Roof Top Comedy. The DVD, ''Eddie Ifft Live'' was recorded at the Sydney Opera House and was released in February 2011 by Punchline DVD. In 2012, Punchline DVD released, Ifft's follow-up DVD, "I Love Pussy".  Because of the obscenity in the name, the DVD was banned from being sold in many outlets in Australia and also from being mentioned on radio and TV. Ifft claimed the title was about his love for cats.

===Television===
{{BLP unsourced section|date=June 2015}}
In 2013 Ifft guest starred on the [[FX Network]] sitcom ''[[Legit (2013 TV series)|Legit]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eddie Ifft|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1572061/?ref_=nmbio_bio_nm|website=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he played a personal trainer that loses his way and falls into drugs, alcohol and over eating.  In order to play the part, Ifft had to undergo 3 hours of make-up to appear 40 pounds heavier. 
  
Ifft briefly worked on the ''[[Queen Latifah Show]]'', doing man-on-the-street segments and has been featured on many other TV shows including Fuel TV's ''Daily Habit'' and Showtime's "The Green Room" with [[Paul Provenza]].

In 2006, Ifft moved from New York to Los Angeles where he still resides, developing sitcoms with networks. He starred in a pilot for Comedy Central, entitled ''Strap-On'', and created a show for the [[FX Network]] while performing stand-up comedy on a nightly basis.

===Radio/ Podcasting===
Ifft co-hosted the now-defunct New York City [[WNEW-FM]] morning show ''[[Sports Guys]]''.  He still appears regularly on nationwide radio shows, including [[KROQ-FM]]'s ''[[Kevin and Bean]] Show'', the ''[[Bob and Tom Show]]'', and San Francisco's ''[[Alice 97.3 Morning Show]]'' with Sarah and Vinnie, and the WODCast Podcast, a Crossfit podcast.

==Achievements and awards==
Ifft was one of five finalists in the 2006 MySpace/TBS "Stand-Up or Sit-Down" Competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eddie Ifft @ Stand-Up or Sit Down Finale|url=http://www.myspace.com/video/eddie-ifft/eddie-ifft-stand-up-or-sit-down-finale/3945409|work=myspace|publisher=Myspace LLC|accessdate=14 October 2012|author=Eddie Ifft|date=21 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
