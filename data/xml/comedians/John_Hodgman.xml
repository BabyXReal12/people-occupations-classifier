On June 19, 2009, Hodgman was the headline speaker at the 2009 [[Radio and Television Correspondents' Association]] dinner in Washington, D.C. Hodgman referred to this event as a "Nerd Prom."

Because of his continuing support for ''[[QI]],'' the [[BBC]]'s intellectual comedy quiz, to be shown on [[BBC America]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aoltv.com/2009/08/08/hodgman-activates-rage-gland-against-bbc-america-for-not-picking/ |title=Hodgman activates rage gland against BBC America for not picking up '&amp;#39;QI'&amp;#39; |publisher=AOL TV |date= |accessdate=2013-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hodgman was invited to appear on the show. He was the first “fifth panelist" on the program broadcast December 3, 2009 (the usual line-up being [[Stephen Fry]] as host, [[Alan Davies]] as regular panelist and three guests)—and won, continuing the tradition of a guest winning their "rookie" appearance on the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comedy.org.uk/guide/tv/qi/videos/945/john_hodgman_and_qi/ |title=The British Comedy Guide: John Hodgman and '&amp;#39;QI'&amp;#39; |publisher=Comedy.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
