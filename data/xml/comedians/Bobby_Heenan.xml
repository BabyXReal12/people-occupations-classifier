'''Raymond Louis Heenan''' (November 1, 1944&lt;!--Do not change! Confirmed by Heenan in his autobiography!--&gt;  – September 17, 2017), better known as '''Bobby''' "'''The Brain'''" '''Heenan''', was an American [[professional wrestling]] [[Manager (professional wrestling)|manager]], [[color commentator]], wrestler, and [[comedian]], best known for his time with the [[American Wrestling Association]] (AWA), the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF, now WWE) and [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW).

Frequently described as the greatest professional wrestling manager of all time, he was known for his skill in elevating [[Heel (professional wrestling)|villainous]] on-screen talent by drawing [[heat (professional wrestling)|negative reactions]] for himself and his wrestlers from the crowd. He was paired with numerous wrestlers, including [[Nick Bockwinkel]], whom he led to win the [[AWA World Heavyweight Championship]], and he became an integral figure in the [[1980s professional wrestling boom]] by managing [[King Kong Bundy]] and [[André the Giant]] in WWF main event matches with [[Hulk Hogan]] at [[WrestleMania 2]] and [[WrestleMania III]] respectively.

Known for his quick wit and comedic ability, Heenan also served as a color commentator and is remembered for his on-screen repartee with [[Gorilla Monsoon]]. Heenan retired from full-time appearances in 2000 after a six-year stint as a commentator in WCW but he continued to make sporadic appearances in several promotions. In 2002, he was diagnosed with [[throat cancer]], which limited his appearances in later years, and he died from complications of it in 2017. Outside of wrestling, Heenan authored two books, appeared on numerous television shows, and briefly hosted a parody talk show titled ''The Bobby Heenan Show'' on ''[[WWF Prime Time Wrestling]]''. He was inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] [[WWE Hall of Fame (2004)|class of 2004]].

==Professional wrestling career==

===World Wrestling Association (1965–1974)===
In 1965, Heenan became a regular in William Afflis' (known by his in-ring persona [[Dick the Bruiser]]) Indianapolis-based [[World Wrestling Association (Indianapolis)|WWA promotion]] under the moniker "Pretty Boy" Bobby Heenan.&lt;ref name="Meltzer"/&gt; That year, he wrestled his first match against Calvin "Prince" Pullins.&lt;ref name=Slam/&gt; Heenan said that he was never trained as a wrestler and that it came naturally to him. He was booked as both a manager and a wrestler after the promoters saw how well he handled the physical aspects of his managerial duties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heenan|first1=Bobby|last2=Anderson|first2=Steve|title=Bobby the Brain: Wrestling's Bad Boy Tells All|year=2002|publisher=Triumph Books|isbn=978-1572434653|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his time in WWA, he managed [[Angelo Poffo]] and [[Chris Markoff]], the Assassins ([[Guy Mitchell (wrestler)|Guy Mitchell]] and Joe Tomasso), [[The Valiant Brothers]] and [[The Blackjacks]]. In particular, Heenan was credited with making [[Blackjack Lanza]] one of the top wrestling villains in the country.&lt;ref name="Meltzer"/&gt; This impressed promoter [[Sam Muchnick]], who typically hated wrestling managers, and Heenan is believed to be the only heel manager to work in Muchnick's [[St. Louis Wrestling Club]].&lt;ref name="Meltzer"/&gt; He also occasionally wrestled with a storyline "brother" Guy Heenan, portrayed by Guy Mitchell, from the Assassins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The many faces of John Hill|publisher=[[Canoe.com]]|work=Slam!

He attributed his departure to a dispute with Afflis over pay for his participation in the first-ever wrestling event held at [[Market Square Arena]], emphatically stating that he never returned to the promotion as a result.&lt;ref name="PWInsider"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pwinsider.com/article/112347/looking-back-at-the-illustrious-career-of-bobby-the-brain-heenan.html?p=1|title=Looking back at the illustrious career of  Bobby 'The Brain' Heenan|work=Pro Wrestling Insider|last=Johnson|first=Mike|date=September 17, 2017|accessdate=September 18, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170918110559/https://www.pwinsider.com/article/112347/looking-back-at-the-illustrious-career-of-bobby-the-brain-heenan.html?p=1|archivedate=September 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===American Wrestling Association (1974–1979)===
After leaving WWA, Heenan announced he was now to be known as "The Brain" at his AWA debut in 1974. He took up managing the team of [[Nick Bockwinkel]] and [[Ray Stevens (wrestler)|Ray "The Crippler" Stevens]], a duo which became several-time [[AWA World Tag Team Championship|AWA World Tag Team Champions]] under his leadership.&lt;ref name="PWInsider"/&gt; While Bockwinkel and Stevens feuded with The Crusher and Dick the Bruiser, Bruiser famously called Heenan "Weasel"; this led to his rivals calling him "Weasel" throughout the rest of his wrestling career.&lt;ref name="PWInsider"/&gt; The AWA was the starting point for the first incarnation of his eponymous heel [[Stable (professional wrestling)|stable]], The [[Heenan Family]], which initially consisted of Bockwinkel, Stevens, [[Bobby Duncum Sr.]], and Blackjack Lanza.&lt;ref name=Slam/&gt;

On January 25, 1975, an angry fan fired a gun at Heenan in Chicago's [[International Amphitheatre]] after Heenan interfered in one of Bockwinkel's matches.&lt;ref name=shooting1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/commentary/ct-bobby-heenan-chicago-shooting-column-20171016-story.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180424232418/http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/commentary/ct-bobby-heenan-chicago-shooting-column-20171016-story.html|title=Column: Remembering the time a fan shot at Bobby 'The Brain' Heenan

While Bockwinkel was AWA Champion in 1976, Lanza and Duncum captured the AWA World Tag Team Championship, making Heenan the first manager in history to simultaneously manage both a major promotion's singles and tag team champions.&lt;ref name=TSun&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.torontosun.com/2017/09/17/former-wrestling-manager-bobby-the-brain-heenan-dead-at-73|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171125121140/http://torontosun.com/2017/09/17/former-wrestling-manager-bobby-the-brain-heenan-dead-at-73/wcm/b6f33575-4686-478b-a239-7fa67c7ecfc0|title=Former wrestling manager Bobby 'The Brain' Heenan dead at 73|work=[[Toronto Sun]]|last=Van Der Griend|first=Blaine|date=September 17, 2017|accessdate=September 18, 2017|archivedate=November 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Georgia Championship Wrestling (1979)===
In early 1979, Heenan left the AWA (suspended one year, in [[Kayfabe|storyline]]) to work in [[Georgia Championship Wrestling]] (GCW). During his short tenure in GCW, Heenan managed a stable of wrestlers that included the likes of [[Killer Karl Kox]], [[Bill Eadie|Masked Superstar]], [[Ernie Ladd]] and Blackjack Lanza.&lt;ref name=Slam/&gt; Heenan met a young [[Hulk Hogan]] while in Georgia and later told AWA promoter Verne Gagne that he should hire him.&lt;ref name="PWT"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pwtorch.com/site/2017/09/17/bobby-heenan-greatest-pro-wrestling-manager-time-dead-age-73-long-battle-throat-cancer/|title=Bobby Heenan, greatest pro wrestling manager of all-time, dead at age 72 after long battle with throat cancer|work=Pro Wrestling Torch|last=Keller|first=Wade|date=September 17, 2017|accessdate=September 28, 2017|authorlink=Wade Keller|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170929000334/https://www.pwtorch.com/site/2017/09/17/bobby-heenan-greatest-pro-wrestling-manager-time-dead-age-73-long-battle-throat-cancer/|archivedate=September 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Heenan, he moved his family to [[Atlanta]] after being told by GCW promoter [[Ole Anderson]] that he could work for the promotion as long as he wanted to only to fire him less than a year later. Anderson admitted to firing him but denied promising him indefinite employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mikemooneyham.com/2004/08/15/books-reunions-reignite-feuds/|title=Books, Reunions Reignite Feuds|work=The Wrestling Gospel|last=Mooneyham|first=Mike|date=August 15, 2004|accessdate=April 26, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170917124134/http://www.mikemooneyham.com/2004/08/15/books-reunions-reignite-feuds/|archivedate=September 17, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to AWA (1978–1984)===
In late 1979, Heenan returned to AWA and resumed managing Nick Bockwinkel to renewed championship success, including against Hogan in 1983.&lt;ref name="TSun"/&gt; During AWA's tour of [[Japan]] in 1983, Heenan suffered a neck injury in a match with [[Atsushi Onita]] that would limit his in-ring ability going forward.&lt;ref name="TSun"/&gt;

In 1984, Heenan left AWA to join the [[World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF). While most of the AWA talent left for the WWF during this time without giving proper notice (the AWA required departing talent to work a six-week notice for booking and [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]]-based reasons, with most talent claiming that WWF promoter [[Vince McMahon]] paid them extra ''not'' to work out their notices with the AWA), only Heenan worked out his notice in good faith to the Gagne family.&lt;ref name="PWInsider"/&gt; He was written out of AWA television when [[Wally Karbo]] announced on the September 28 AWA broadcast that Heenan had been suspended indefinitely by AWA President Stanley Blackburn for initiating a brawl with [[Fabulous Ones]].&lt;ref name="TSun"/&gt;

===World Wrestling Federation (1984–1993)===

====Manager (1984–1993)====
Heenan was signed by the WWF in 1984 with the intention of him managing [[Jesse Ventura]], however Ventura's retirement due to blood clots in his lungs prevented this from happening.&lt;ref name="TSun"/&gt; Instead, Heenan managed [[Big John Studd]] in his feud against [[André the Giant]]. Studd challenged André to a [[United States dollar|US$]]15,000 bodyslam match at the first [[WrestleMania (1985)|WrestleMania]], with the stipulation being that André would have to retire had he lost. André won the match and then took the bag with the $15,000 and started throwing it out to the crowd before Heenan snatched the bag.&lt;ref name="TSun"/&gt;

[[File:Andre and Bobby Heenan.jpg|thumb|Heenan (left) managed many of the WWF's top stars, notably leading [[André the Giant]] (right)|alt=Bobby Heenan (front), a Caucasian man in a black sequin jacket, leads André the Giant to the ring]] 
Heenan reformed the Heenan Family,&lt;ref name=Slam/&gt; which over the years in the WWF would include Studd, [[Ken Patera|"Olympic Strong Man" Ken Patera]], [[Buddy Rose|"Playboy" Buddy Rose]], [[Paul Orndorff|"Mr. Wonderful" Paul Orndorff]], [[King Kong Bundy]], André the Giant, [[Sivi Afi|High Chief Sivi Afi]], [[the Brain Busters]] (former [[The Four Horsemen (professional wrestling)|Four Horsemen]] members [[Arn Anderson]] and [[Tully Blanchard]]), [[Rick Rude|"Ravishing" Rick Rude]], [[Harley Race|"King" Harley Race]], [[The Islanders (professional wrestling)|the Islanders]] ([[Tonga Fifita|Haku]] and [[Sam Fatu|Tama]]), [[Hercules (wrestler)|Hercules]], [[The Barbarian (wrestler)|The Barbarian]], [[Curt Hennig|Mr. Perfect]], [[Terry Taylor|The Red Rooster]], and [[Steve Lombardi|The Brooklyn Brawler]].&lt;ref name="miamiherald"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/sports/fighting/article173893081.html|title=RIP: A life look at WWE Hall of Famer Bobby ‘The Brain’ Heenan|last=Varsallone|first=Jim|date=September 17, 2014|accessdate=September 18, 2017|work=[[Miami Herald]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170919005504/http://www.miamiherald.com/sports/fighting/article173893081.html|archivedate=September 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heenan and the Heenan Family had a feud with [[Hulk Hogan]] in the 1980s, and Heenan managed two [[WrestleMania]] challengers to Hogan's title, King Kong Bundy in [[WrestleMania II|1986]], and André the Giant in [[WrestleMania III|1987]]. While neither Bundy nor André won the title at that time, André later bested Hogan for the championship on ''[[WWF The Main Event|The Main Event]]'' on February 5, 1988, in a controversial win after he aligned himself with [[Ted DiBiase|"The Million Dollar Man" Ted DiBiase]].&lt;ref name="PWInsider"/&gt;

After being derided by announcers for his first five years in the WWF (mostly by Gorilla Monsoon) for never managing a champion, [[WrestleMania V]] was promoted (mostly by Jesse Ventura and later Gorilla Monsoon) as Heenan's quest, and best chance since [[WrestleMania III]] to manage a champion. Heenan finally managed his first champion in the WWF when "Ravishing" Rick Rude upset [[The Ultimate Warrior]] for the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|WWF Intercontinental Championship]], a match Heenan insured Rude would win by holding Warrior's leg down so he could not break the pin.&lt;ref name="Slam"/&gt; Shortly thereafter, he led the Brain Busters to win the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF World Tag Team Championship]].&lt;ref name="WWFTag"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/worldtagteam/3044541321111211 |title=WWE: History of the World Tag Team Championship|accessdate=April 26, 2018|publisher=WWE|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319053122/http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/worldtagteam/3044541321111211|archivedate=March 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Busters had lost the titles back to [[Demolition (professional wrestling)|Demolition]] a few months later,&lt;ref name="WWFTag"/&gt; he led the [[The Colossal Connection|Colossal Connection]] (André and Haku) to win the Tag Team Championship when they defeated Demolition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Royal Duncan &amp; Gary Will | title=Wrestling Title Histories | publisher=Archeus Communications | year=2006|edition=4th | isbn=0-9698161-5-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Demolition would win the titles back in [[WrestleMania VI]].&lt;ref name="WM6"/&gt; Immediately after the loss, Heenan began blaming the loss to [[André the Giant]] going as far as slapping him.&lt;ref name="WM6"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.prowrestling.net/article.php?Powell-s-WrestleMania-6-review-Hulk-Hogan-vs.-Ultimate-Warrior-for-the-WWF-Championship-and-Intercontinental-Championship-Ted-DiBiase-vs.-Jake-Roberts-Andre-the-Giant-and-Haku-vs.-Demolition-for-the-WWF-Tag-Titles-36460|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170918154303/http://www.prowrestling.net/article.php?Powell-s-WrestleMania-6-review-Hulk-Hogan-vs.-Ultimate-Warrior-for-the-WWF-Championship-and-Intercontinental-Championship-Ted-DiBiase-vs.-Jake-Roberts-Andre-the-Giant-and-Haku-vs.-Demolition-for-the-WWF-Tag-Titles-36460|title=Powell's WrestleMania 6 review: Hulk Hogan vs. Ultimate Warrior for the WWF Championship and Intercontinental Championship, Ted DiBiase vs. Jake Roberts, Andre the Giant and Haku vs. Demolition for the WWF Tag Titles|date=April 5, 2014|accessdate=September 18, 2017|archivedate=September 18, 2017|last=Powell|first=Jason|work=Pro Wrestling Dot Net}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few months after that, he led Mr. Perfect to Intercontinental Championship success.&lt;ref name="80s"&gt;{{cite book|last=Shields|first=Brian|title=Main Event: WWE in the Raging 80s|year=2010|publisher=WWE Books|isbn=978-1416532576|pages=63–64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heenan also wrestled sporadically in his WWF run. In his in-ring debut at [[Madison Square Garden]] in November 1984, he pinned [[Salvatore Bellomo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/84.htm|accessdate=January 9, 2018|publisher=The History of WWE|title=The Omni – 1984|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Ph1kKm14?url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/84.htm|archivedate=May 19, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heenan's most notable victory came at [[WrestleMania IV]], teaming with The Islanders to defeat [[The British Bulldogs]] and [[Koko B.

Heenan retired from managing in 1991 to become a full-time commentator. Nonetheless, Heenan crossed the line to managing sporadically. When the WWF signed [[Ric Flair]], Heenan spent several weeks talking Flair up as "The Real World's Heavyweight Champion", appearing onscreen with Flair's [[Big Gold Belt]].&lt;ref name="NYP"/&gt; He continued to act as an adviser to Flair during his WWF run from 1991 to 1993. Though he nominally managed Flair, Heenan's former protégé Mr. Perfect, who temporarily retired due to injury, would regularly accompany Flair to ringside as his "Executive Consultant".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Kevin |last= Sullivan |year= 2010 |title= The WWE Championship: A Look Back at the Rich History of the WWE Championship |publisher= WWE Books |location= New York |isbn= 1439193215 |page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[Royal Rumble (1993)|1993 Royal Rumble]], he introduced [[Lex Luger|"The Narcissist" Lex Luger]] to the WWF to exact revenge on his former protégé, Mr. Perfect.&lt;ref name="Luger"&gt;Wrestling 93: Rulebreaker, Spring 1993 Issue, Article "Bobby Heenan and Lex Luger: The Total Package of Brain and Brawn!", pp.48–51.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Commentator (1986–1994)====
[[File:Brooklyn Brawler &amp; Bobby Heenan.jpg|thumb|right|Heenan became a commentator while in the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]], but continued to manage various wrestlers, such as [[Steve Lombardi|The Brooklyn Brawler]] (behind Heenan)|alt=Bobby Heenan, dressed in a black sequin jacket, leads The Brooklyn Brawler to the ring in the late 1980s]]
In 1986, WWF owner Vince McMahon took full advantage of his microphone and comedic skills and Heenan became a [[color commentator]] in addition to his managing duties. He replaced Jesse Ventura on ''[[WWF Primetime Wrestling|Prime Time Wrestling]]'' and ''[[WWF All American Wrestling (show)|All American Wrestling]]'', aired on the [[USA Network]], teaming up with [[Gorilla Monsoon]]. He also replaced Ventura to team up with Monsoon on the syndicated ''[[WWF All-Star Wrestling|All-Star Wrestling]]'', which was replaced in the fall of 1986 with ''[[WWF Wrestling Challenge|Wrestling Challenge]]''. Although the purpose of these shows were to summarize weekly WWF events, viewers tuned in to see Heenan and Monsoon's interactions.&lt;ref name="NYP"/&gt; Heenan, calling himself a "broadcast journalist",&lt;ref name="PWHOF"/&gt;  bashed fan favorites and cheered for their opponents while they cheated or did something under-handed.&lt;ref name="Guzzo"/&gt; He referred to the fans as "humanoids", and fan favorites, especially [[Job (professional wrestling)|enhancement talent]], as "ham-and-eggers." Another moment between the pair often occurred when Heenan would go on a long rant supporting the villainous wrestlers, until an exasperated Monsoon would say either: "Will you stop?", "Give me a break!", or a sarcastic, "Please!"&lt;ref name="PWInsider"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ESPN"/&gt;

Heenan, still suffering from the broken neck he received ten years earlier and unable to cope with the long working hours, decided to leave the WWF at the end of 1993. He was given an on-air farewell by Gorilla Monsoon on the edition of December 6, 1993 of ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]]'', broadcast from the [[Westchester County Center]] in [[White Plains, New York]]. Fed up by Heenan's constant insults, Monsoon threw him and his belongings out of the arena and onto the street. After the show, Heenan stated that he and Monsoon embraced each other and wept for over an hour in the hotel where they both were staying.&lt;ref name="TSun"/&gt;

Heenan's original plan was to retire, spend time with his family, and relax, but he was contacted by WCW soon after he left the WWF. He was unsure at first, but accepted their offer once he found out that WCW provided lighter work schedules and health insurance. Heenan also cited the short driving distance between WCW's home base of [[Atlanta]] and his daughter's school in [[Alabama]].&lt;ref name=Gerweck&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gerweck.net/heenaninterview.htm|title=Bobby Heenan Interview|publisher=gerweck.net|accessdate=August 24, 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930155123/http://www.gerweck.net/heenaninterview.htm|archivedate=September 30, 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PWInsider"/&gt;

===World Championship Wrestling (1994–2000)===
On January 27, 1994, Heenan made his debut in [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW). He was originally brought in to replace [[Jesse Ventura]], his former client, as the color commentator for ''[[WCW Saturday Night]]'' and eventually took over Ventura's position as the company's lead commentator, replacing him for pay-per-view events and on the syndicated ''[[WCW Worldwide]]'' and ''[[Clash of the Champions]]'' events produced for [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]]. When ''[[WCW Monday Nitro]]'' premiered in September 1995, Heenan left ''Saturday Night'' to work on the new show full-time and joined former [[Chicago Bears]] defensive lineman [[Steve McMichael]] as an analyst alongside play-by-play man [[Eric Bischoff]].&lt;ref name="TSun"/&gt; He was later frequently paired with [[Tony Schiavone]].&lt;ref name="PWT"/&gt;

In 1996, Heenan made a one-off return to ringside at [[The Great American Bash (1996)|The Great American Bash]] as the manager of two of his former clients, Ric Flair and Arn Anderson, in a tag team match against his broadcast colleague McMichael and then-[[Carolina Panthers]] linebacker [[Kevin Greene (American football)|Kevin Greene]]. Heenan was instrumental in convincing McMichael to turn on his partner, which enabled Flair and Anderson to win the match, and fill the open spot in [[Four Horsemen (professional wrestling)|The Four Horsemen]] that [[Brian Pillman]] left behind when he departed the company earlier in the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=2007 Wrestling Almanac &amp; Book of Facts: Great American Bash 1996|work=Wrestling's Historical Cards|publisher=Kappa Publishing|year=2007|pages=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the following pay-per-view, [[Bash at the Beach (1996)|Bash at the Beach 1996]], Heenan reacted incredulously when Hulk Hogan walked out during the main event match between [[The Outsiders (professional wrestling)|The Outsiders]] ([[Kevin Nash]] and [[Scott Hall]]) and [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]], [[Lex Luger]] and [[Randy Savage]] by shouting "Whose side is he on?"&lt;ref name="TSun"/&gt; Hogan subsequently turned his back on the fans and joined Hall and Nash to form the [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|New World Order]] (nWo). Despite no longer being a fan favorite, Heenan continued to bash Hogan on commentary by gloating that he had been right about him all along, continuing a rivalry that dated back to their time in AWA.&lt;ref name="SI"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.si.com/extra-mustard/2017/09/18/bobby-heenan-wwe-bruce-prichard-jimmy-hart|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171005100850/https://www.si.com/extra-mustard/2017/09/18/bobby-heenan-wwe-bruce-prichard-jimmy-hart|title=Bruce Prichard, Jimmy Hart share their favorite Bobby ‘The Brain’ Heenan memories|last=Barrasso|first=Justin|work=[[Sports Illustrated]]|date=September 18, 2017|accessdate=October 4, 2017|archivedate=October 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in late January 2000, WCW replaced Heenan on ''Monday Nitro'' and pay-per-view events with [[Mark Madden]]. Heenan continued to commentate on ''[[WCW Thunder|Thunder]]'' along with [[Mike Tenay]], and later Schiavone, until he was replaced by [[Stevie Ray]] beginning in July 2000. Heenan was then only seen with Scott Hudson on ''Worldwide'' until he was released by WCW in November 2000.&lt;ref name=Slam&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/Bios/heenan.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180303074432/http://slam.canoe.com/Slam/Wrestling/Bios/heenan.html|title=Bobby Heenan's Slam!

WCW went out of business less than a year after his release.&lt;ref name=Daytona&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daytondailynews.com/sports/local-wrestling-star-bobby-heenan-was-the-greatest-manager-ever-but-even-greater-friend/rqfJvhYWSOal0bNbVUld4J/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171007120355/http://www.daytondailynews.com/sports/local-wrestling-star-bobby-heenan-was-the-greatest-manager-ever-but-even-greater-friend/rqfJvhYWSOal0bNbVUld4J/|title=Local Wrestling Star: Bobby Heenan was the greatest manager ever, but an even greater friend|work=[[Dayton Daily News]]|last=Bethel|first=B.J.|date=September 20, 2017|accessdate=October 7, 2017|archivedate=October 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later career (2001–2009)===
On April 1, 2001, Heenan returned to the WWF and provided commentary to the Gimmick Battle Royal match at [[WrestleMania X-Seven]] alongside [[Gene Okerlund|"Mean" Gene Okerlund]].&lt;ref name="TSun"/&gt; Heenan was inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] [[WWE Hall of Fame (2004)|class of 2004]] (WWF changed its name to WWE in 2002) by [[Blackjack Lanza]]. The following night, he appeared at [[WrestleMania XX]] in a skit with Gene Okerlund, [[Mae Young]] and [[The Fabulous Moolah]].&lt;ref name=Slam/&gt; He inducted his protégés [[Paul Orndorff]], [[The Blackjacks]] and [[Nick Bockwinkel]] into the WWE Hall of Fame [[WWE Hall of Fame (2005)|class of 2005]], [[WWE Hall of Fame (2006)|class of 2006]] and [[WWE Hall of Fame (2007)|class of 2007]] respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/exclusives/heenanbockwinkel|title=No "Weasel-ing" out for Heenan|publisher=[[WWE]]|accessdate=August 24, 2007|last=Dee|first=Louie|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070528112410/http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/exclusives/heenanbockwinkel |archivedate = May 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his last WWE appearance, he was one of the speakers for "Mr McMahon appreciation night" on the June 11, 2007 episode of ''Raw''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/results/raw/raw2006/1181620600.shtml|title=Raw Results – 6/11/07 – Wilkes Barre, PA (2007 WWE Draft &amp; more)|last=Golden|first=Hunter|work=WrestleView|date=June 11, 2017|accessdate=August 24, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170806064045/http://www.wrestleview.com/results/raw/raw2006/1181620600.shtml|archivedate=August 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heenan made several appearances on the [[independent circuit]]. In February 2001, Heenan did color commentary for the ''[[Women of Wrestling|WOW Unleashed]]'' pay-per-view. Also in 2001, Heenan worked briefly as a "[[sports agent]]" in the [[Xcitement Wrestling Federation]] with [[Curt Hennig]] under his tutelage.&lt;ref name="PWInsider"/&gt; In 2004, he feuded with fellow manager [[Jim Cornette]] in [[Ring of Honor]].&lt;ref name="2004ROH"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rohwrestling.com/content/2004-ring-honor-results|title=2004 Ring of Honor Results|publisher=[[Ring of Honor]]|accessdate=September 28, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170730201810/http://www.rohwrestling.com/content/2004-ring-honor-results|archivedate=July 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite declining health in his final years, Heenan continued to make appearances at fan conventions. He enjoyed staying in touch with former colleagues and fans.&lt;ref name="PWT"/&gt;

==Other media==

===Health and death===
In January 2002, Heenan announced that he had [[Esophageal cancer|throat cancer]].&lt;ref name="Meltzer"/&gt; By 2004, the cancer had gone into remission.&lt;ref name="Guzzo"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Guzzo|first1=Paul|title= Wrestling star Bobby "The Brain" Heenan of Largo is dead at 72|url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/obituaries/wrestling-star-bobby-the-brain-heenan-of-largo-is-dead-at-73/2337830|work=[[Tampa Bay Times]]|date=September 17, 2017|accessdate=September 25, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170920092651/http://www.tampabay.com/news/obituaries/wrestling-star-bobby-the-brain-heenan-of-largo-is-dead-at-73/2337830|archivedate=September 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The  treatments caused a great deal of weight loss, dramatically altering his appearance and voice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/bobby-heenan-dies-wrestling-1.4294811|title=Bobby Heenan, legendary pro wrestling manager, dead at 73|date=September 18, 2017|publisher=[[CBC News]]|accessdate=September 25, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170919235841/http://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/bobby-heenan-dies-wrestling-1.4294811|archivedate=September 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the last few years of his life, he suffered a series of falls.

Rosenberg stated that Heenan "operated on multiple levels", adding: "If you were a little kid, he was the foil to your hero. As an adult, you look back and appreciate just how much of a comedic genius he was."&lt;ref name="ESPN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/20746914/wwe-bobby-brain-heenan-lasting-impact-world-professional-wrestling|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171003224838/http://www.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/20746914/wwe-bobby-brain-heenan-lasting-impact-world-professional-wrestling|title=Bobby "The Brain" Heenan helped shape the world of professional wrestling|publisher=[[ESPN]]|last=Rosenberg|first=Peter|authorlink=Peter Rosenberg|date=September 18, 2017|accessdate=October 3, 2017|archivedate=October 3, 2017|deadurl=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Longtime on-screen rival Hulk Hogan wrote in the foreword to Heenan's ''Bad Boy Tells All'': "Bobby was a legendary wrestler ... He will go down in the books as someone who mastered the craft".&lt;ref name="indy"/&gt; These comments were echoed by [[Triple H]], who said that Heenan was one of the best in-ring talents but chose to be a manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAbEWf_9K38|title=Triple H: Bobby Heenan Wasn't Just a Manager, One of the Greatest Wrestlers Ever|work=[[TMZ|TMZ Sports]]|publisher=[[YouTube]]|date=September 18, 2017|accessdate=October 3, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170930140927/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAbEWf_9K38|archivedate=September 30, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist [[Wade Keller]] states that what sets him apart from other managers was his ability to take "tremendous [[bump (professional wrestling)|bumps]]" (falls to the mat after being attacked). Pro wrestling historian George Schire praised his in-ring ability, commenting: "Bobby was a good athlete – flipping over the ropes, he could do it all. And whether it was as the manager or as a wrestler, he could get the crowd going as well as anyone."&lt;ref name="PWT"/&gt;

His comedic ability was praised by [[Dave Meltzer]] of the ''[[Wrestling Observer Newsletter]]'', who wrote that Heenan could have been a successful television actor.&lt;ref name="Meltzer"/&gt; Comedian [[David Letterman]] became a fan of Heenan after seeing him in WWA.&lt;ref name="indy"&gt;{{cite news|title=Pro wrestling icon Bobby Heenan dies at 72|url=http://www.indystar.com/story/entertainment/arts/2017/09/18/pro-wrestling-icon-bobby-heenan-dies-72/676063001/|archiveurl=https://www.indystar.com/story/entertainment/arts/2017/09/18/pro-wrestling-icon-bobby-heenan-dies-72/676063001/|first=David|last=Lindquist|date=September 17, 2017|accessdate=October 2, 2017|work=[[Indy Star]]|archivedate=April 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; WWE Hall of Fame commentator [[Jim Ross]] selected Heenan as the greatest talent in the history of the wrestling business. Ross praised Heenan's ability as a color commentator, stating: "He was naturally funny ... and enhanced every single talent, including the heroes, even though Bobby did not support the fan favorites as the bad guy announcer. [Heenan] did what every announcer should strive to do and that is to make talent bigger stars than they are and to embellish every talent’s TV persona."&lt;ref name=ross&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/classics/jim-ross/jim-ross-gorilla-monsoon-bobby-heenan-26041707|title=Jim Ross on Bobby Heenan, Gorilla Monsoon|date=July 31, 2012|publisher=WWE|last=Ross|first=Jim|authorlink=Jim Ross|accessdate=October 2, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120902143753/http://www.wwe.com/classics/jim-ross/jim-ross-gorilla-monsoon-bobby-heenan-26041707|archivedate=September 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
