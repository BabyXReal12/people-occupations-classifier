'''Marcus David Maron''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ær|ən}} {{respell|MARR|ən}}; born September 27, 1963) is an American [[stand-up comedian]], podcaster, writer and actor.

In the 1990s and 2000s, Maron was a frequent guest on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' and appeared more than forty times on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'', more than any other stand-up comedian.&lt;ref name="WBEZ"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=January 5, 2010|series=Late Night With Conan O'Brien|serieslink=Late Night with Conan O'Brien|network=NBC |airdate=January 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He hosted ''[[Comedy Central]]'s [[Short Attention Span Theater]]'' from 1993 to 1994, replacing [[Jon Stewart]]. He was also a regular guest on ''[[Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn]]'' and hosted the short-lived 2002 American version of the British [[game show]] ''[[Never Mind the Buzzcocks]]'' on [[VH1]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/shows/series/buzzcocks/ |title=Never Mind the Buzzcocks |work=VH1 (via archive.org) |accessdate=February 10, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121005162342/http://www.vh1.com/shows/series/buzzcocks/ |archivedate=October 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a regular on the left-wing radio network [[Air America (radio network)|Air America]] from 2004 to 2009, hosting ''[[The Marc Maron Show]]'' and co-hosting ''[[Morning Sedition]]'' and ''[[Breakroom Live]]''. 

In September 2009, soon after ''Breakroom Live'' was cancelled, Maron began hosting the twice-weekly [[podcast]] ''[[WTF with Marc Maron]]'' where he interviews comedians, authors, musicians and celebrities in his garage in [[Highland Park, Los Angeles, California]]. Highlights include a 2010 episode with [[Louis C.K.]] that was rated the #1 podcast episode of all time by ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' magazine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Haglund |first=David |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/ten_years_in_your_ears/2014/12/best_podcast_episodes_ever_the_25_best_from_serial_to_the_ricky_gervais.html |title=Best podcast episodes ever: The 25 best from Serial to the Ricky Gervais Show |publisher=Slate.com |date=2014-12-14 |accessdate=2018-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; a 2012 interview with comedian [[Todd Glass]] in which Glass publicly revealed that he was [[gay]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/16/todd-glass-comes-out-as-gay-on-wtf-with-marc-maron_n_1209291.html | work=[[The Huffington Post]] | first=Ross | last=Luippold | title=Beloved Comedian Comes Out As Gay On 'WTF' | date=2012-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a 2015 interview with then-[[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]].&lt;ref name="WBEZ"&gt;{{cite news|title=Wikipedia Files: Marc Maron (WTF Podcast)|author=Justin Kaufmann|url=http://www.wbez.org/blog/justin-kaufmann/2011-08-29/wikipedia-files-marc-maron-wtf-podcast-91194|newspaper=[[WBEZ]] |date=August 29, 2011|accessdate=September 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2013 to 2016, he starred in his own [[IFC (U.S. TV channel)|IFC]] television comedy series, ''[[Maron (TV series)|Maron]]'', for which he also served as executive producer and occasional writer. Since 2017 he has co-starred in the [[Netflix]] comedy series ''[[GLOW (TV series)|GLOW]]''.

== Early life ==
Maron was born in [[Jersey City, New Jersey]], to [[orthopedic surgeon]] father&lt;ref name=WTF-Lynskey-2014&gt;{{cite web|last1=Maron|first1=Marc|title=Episode 564 - Melanie Lynskey|url=http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episodes/episode_564_-_melanie_lynskey|website=[[WTF with Marc Maron]]|accessdate=8 January 2015|date=1 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barry R.

Maron is from a Jewish family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Ron|last=Netsky|url=https://www.rochestercitynewspaper.com/rochester/interview-marc-maron/Content?oid=2270417|title=INTERVIEW: Marc Maron |work=CITY Newspaper|date=September 11, 2013|accessdate=April 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Andrew|last=Clark|url=http://www.bu.edu/today/2013/marc-maron-does-television-too/|title=Marc Maron Does Television Too |work=Boston University|date=May 3, 2013|accessdate=April 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He lived in [[Wayne, New Jersey]] until he was six.&lt;ref&gt;Levin, Eric. [https://njmonthly.com/articles/jersey-living/marc-maron/ "Comedian Marc Maron: The Stand-Up Notables Sit Down With; Marc Maron's must-hear podcast leads to a book and TV series."], ''[[New Jersey Monthly]]'', June 14, 2013. Accessed October 10, 2017. "New Jersey Monthly: Before your family moved to Albuquerque, you spent your first six years in Wayne. How Jersey do you feel? Marc Maron: I do feel attached to the place."&lt;/ref&gt; Maron's father joined the [[U.S. Air Force]] for two years for his [[medical residency]] in [[Alaska]], and so Maron and his family moved there. When his father left the Air Force, he moved his family to [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]], and started a medical practice.&lt;ref name="WBEZ"/&gt; Maron lived in Albuquerque from third grade through high school.&lt;ref name=Alibi-WTF-2010&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chisholm|first1=Christie|title=Who Is Marc Maron?

In 1986, Maron graduated from [[Boston University]] with a [[B.A.]] in English literature.&lt;ref name=Broad&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hayes|first=Dade|title=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|journal=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]]|date=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bostonia-WTF-2013&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clark|first1=Andrew|title=Marc Maron's WTF|url=http://www.bu.edu/bostonia/winter-spring13/marc-maron/|website=[[Bostonia]]|publisher=[[Boston University]]|accessdate=9 January 2015|issue=Winter-Spring 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Maron first performed standup in 1987 when he was 24 years old.&lt;ref name=LeonardLopate-DarknessDepression-2014&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lopate|first1=Leonard|title=Darkness, Depression, Addiction, and Anxiety: Marc Maron Probes the Inner Lives of Comedians|url=http://www.wnyc.org/story/marc-maron/|accessdate=8 January 2015|work=[[The Leonard Lopate Show]]|date=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maron started his comedy career at [[The Comedy Store]] in Los Angeles and became an associate of [[Sam Kinison]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Maron|first=Marc|title=The Jerusalem Syndrome: My Life as a Reluctant Messiah|publisher=Broadway Books|year=2001|chapter=7|isbn=0-7679-0810-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later moved to New York City and became part of the [[Alternative comedy#New York|New York alternative comedy]] scene. During the summer of 1994, he appeared a few times on Monday open-mic night, coordinated by Tracey Metzger, at the now-closed Greenwich Village location of the Boston Comedy Club. He auditioned unsuccessfully for the 1995 ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' cast overhaul and attributes being passed over to being high during a meeting with show creator and producer [[Lorne Michaels]].&lt;ref name="WBEZ"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929091416/http://www.airamerica.com/maron/story_michaels|archivedate=September 29, 2007|url=http://www.airamerica.com/maron/story_michaels|title=Lorne Michaels and Gorillas|year=1998|author=Maron, Marc|publisher=Air America}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Itzkoff|first1=Dave|title=The God of ‘SNL’ Will See You Now|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/25/arts/television/the-god-of-snl-will-see-you-now.html|website=The New York Times|accessdate=September 20, 2014|date=August 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maron continued to be a standup performer and also began to appear on television; his voice was used in episodes of ''[[Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist]]'', and he hosted ''[[Short Attention Span Theater]]'' for a time. He also recorded half-hour specials for [[HBO]] and ''[[Comedy Central Presents]]'' as well as comedy showcases like the [[Cam Neely|Cam Neely Foundation]] fundraiser, which also featured performers such as [[Jon Stewart]], [[Denis Leary]], and [[Steven Wright]]. He frequently appeared in the live alternative standup series he had organized with [[Janeane Garofalo]] called ''Eating It'', which used the rock bar [[Luna Lounge]] in New York's [[Lower East Side]] as its venue, from the 1990s until the building was razed in 2005. {{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

His only major film credit for years was a small part credited as "angry promoter" in the 2000 [[Cameron Crowe]] film ''[[Almost Famous]]'', in which he is first seen fighting with [[Noah Taylor]]'s character and then yelling at and chasing after the main characters as they drive away on a bus, at which point he yells, "Lock the gates!" which is now used in the intro to his podcasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0181875|title=Almost Famous|publisher=[[IMDb.com]]|accessdate=February 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also featured at the Luna Lounge in the 1997 mockumentary ''[[Who's the Caboose?]]'' starring [[Sarah Silverman]] and [[Sam Seder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0179526|title=Who's the Caboose? (1997)|publisher=[[IMDb.com]]|accessdate=October 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His first one-man show, ''Jerusalem Syndrome'', had an extended [[off-Broadway]] run in 2000 and was released in book form in 2001. In 2009, he began work shopping another one-man show, ''Scorching The Earth''. According to Maron (in ''Scorching The Earth'') these two shows "bookend" his relationship with his second wife, comic [[Mishna Wolff]], which ended in a bitter divorce.

In May 2008, he toured with [[Eugene Mirman]] and [[Andy Kindler]] in ''Stand Uppity: Comedy That Makes You Feel Better About Yourself and Superior to Others.'' In January 2009, a collaboration with [[Sam Seder]] which had begun in September 2007 as a weekly hour-long video webcast became ''[[Breakroom Live with Maron &amp; Seder]]'', produced by Air America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.breakroomlive.com |title=The Majority Report with Sam Seder &amp;#124; Majority Report Radio |publisher=Breakroomlive.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until its cancellation in July 2009, the show was webcast live weekdays at 3&amp;nbsp;pm Eastern, with episodes archived for later viewing as well. In its final incarnation, the show was quite informal, taking place in the actual break room of Air America Media, with the cafeteria vending machines just off-camera. This meant occasional distractions when Air America staff and management alike would occasionally come in for food and drink. Maron and Seder held court in an online "post-show chat" with viewers, in an even less formal continuation of each webcast, after the credits had rolled.

Maron's standup comedy act is marked by his commitment to self-revelation and cultural analysis. He is particularly known for relentless on-stage exploration of his own relationships with family, girlfriends, and other standup comedians that he has known and befriended over his many years in the business. {{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} In October 2013, Maron released his first hour long special via Netflix titled, ''Marc Maron: Thinky Pain''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Bangs|first=Lance|title=Marc Maron: Thinky Pain|date=2013-10-15|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3004634/|accessdate=2016-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maron would follow this with another special titled, ''More Later'', which he released in December 2015, on the website Epix.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Goldthwait|first=Bobcat|title=Marc Maron: More Later|date=2015-12-04|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5126220/|accessdate=2016-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, he provided the voice of Magnus Hammersmith in three episodes of ''[[Metalocalypse]]''. Maron has made two guest appearances as himself on [[Louis C.K.]]'s show ''[[Louie (U.S. TV series)|Louie]],'' first in the third season episode ''Ikea/Piano Lesson''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2260196/|title="Louie" Ikea/Piano Lesson|publisher=[[imdb.com]]|accessdate=October 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then again in the fourth season episode ''Pamela: Part 3''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3775768/|title="Louie" Pamela: Part 3|publisher=[[imdb.com]]|accessdate=June 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Maron (TV series)|Maron]]'', a television series created by and starring Maron for a 10-episode first season, premiered on [[IFC (U.S. TV channel)|IFC]] on May 3, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Coming Soon – Maron|url=http://www.ifc.com/coming-soon|publisher=[[IFC (U.S. TV channel)|IFC]]|accessdate=February 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show is loosely  autobiographical, revolving around Maron's life as a twice-divorced sober comedian running a comedy podcast out of his garage but establishing many differences between the real-life Maron and the version of him on TV.

A comedy special, ''[[Marc Maron: Too Real]]'', was released on [[Netflix]] on September 5, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.netflix.com/title/80177405|title=Marc Maron: Too Real|accessdate=September 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 31, 2018 it was revealed that Maron would play a supporting role in [[Todd Phillips]]'s upcoming [[Joker in other media|Joker]] film starring [[Joaquin Phoenix]] as the title character alongside [[Robert De Niro]] and [[Zazie Beetz]].

===Radio===
From almost the first day of the [[liberal talk radio]] network [[Air America (radio network)|Air America]]'s broadcasts in 2004, Maron co-hosted ''[[Morning Sedition]]'', a three-hour early-morning [[radio show]] with [[Mark Riley (American radio host)|Mark Riley]] that aired weekdays from 6&amp;nbsp;am to 9&amp;nbsp;am Eastern time. The show was unique in the Air America lineup in its heavy reliance on both live and preproduced sketch comedy, utilizing the talents of staff writers as well as the on-air hosts. The format was a [[Left-wing politics|left-leaning]] near-satire of typical morning "Buddy" radio programs, including recurring characters, interviews, and listener call-in segments, and it attracted a loyal fan base. {{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

As 2005 came to a end, it became known that Maron's contract would not be renewed on its December 1, 2005, end date because of problems with then Air America executive Danny Goldberg. Goldberg reportedly did not "get" the comedy or agree with the satiric and often angry tone set by Maron and other writers ([[Jim Earl]] and [[Kent Jones (writer)|Kent Jones]]) for a morning drive-time show. On November 28, 2005, it was officially announced that Maron's contract had not been renewed. His last ''Morning Sedition'' broadcast was on December 16, 2005, and the show was discontinued shortly thereafter. {{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

On February 28, 2006, Maron began hosting a nighttime radio program with [[Jim Earl]] as sidekick for [[KEIB|KTLK Progressive Talk 1150AM]] in Los Angeles called ''[[The Marc Maron Show]]'' from 10:00&amp;nbsp;pm until midnight PST. The program was frequently delayed (sometimes for over an hour) owing to KTLK's contractual agreement to broadcast local sports events that would often go into overtime. ''The Marc Maron Show'' was never nationally syndicated by Air America despite reported contractual clauses promising such. The show was streamed online live, but the show was not publicized, and the existence of the stream was not well promoted. {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

On July 5, it was announced that Maron's final episode would be on July 14. A few days before that date, Maron bluntly discussed his long struggle with Air America Radio's executives on-air. In 2008, Marc and [[Sam Seder]] expanded their prior collaboration on a weekly hour-long video webcast (streamed at The Sam Seder Show website) into a daily show (and "post-show chat") produced by Air America Media called ''[[Maron v. Seder]]''. The show became ''[[Breakroom Live with Maron &amp; Seder]]'' starting in 2009 and could be viewed on Air America Media's website. On July 15, 2009, after less than one year, Air America Media canceled ''Breakroom Live''. According to the show's hosts, the cancellation was for financial reasons. Ironically, the day before the cancellation, the show got some of the first real publicity it had ever received when MaximumFun.org posted its podcast of an interview with Maron on ''[[The Sound of Young America]]''. {{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

On the final ''Breakroom Live'' webcast, Maron said that this marked the third time since 2005 he'd been told by an executive at the network that his services would not be required in the immediate future. Co-host Sam Seder pointed out that this would be the end of his ''fourth'' show at Air America since the troubled network's inception. {{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

===''WTF with Marc Maron'' podcast===
{{main article|WTF with Marc Maron}}

On September 1, 2009, Maron began a twice-weekly [[podcast]] called ''[[WTF with Marc Maron]]''. Released Mondays and Thursdays, the show features interviews with fellow comedians, both old friends and acquaintances. In a free-form discussion, Maron and his guests touch on topics like the arc of the interviewees' careers, shared past experiences, and stories from the road. The show was originally produced after-hours in the Air America offices, to which Maron and his producer still had keys. Around the 20th episode, Maron temporarily moved to Los Angeles before announcing that the move would be permanent in the 22nd. ''WTF'' is currently recorded in his garage, with the bulk of the guests meeting him there, though he does have a mobile setup to talk to guests. ''WTF'' has reached No.&amp;nbsp;1 on iTunes comedy section numerous times. Though it is a free podcast, it has a number of rotating sponsors and accepts donations.

On May 17, 2011, it was announced that a version of ''WTF with Marc Maron'' is now available for noncommercial broadcast via [[Public Radio Exchange]]. The initial offering is ten episodes edited from previous podcasts and is designed, according to co-producer of the broadcast package [[Jesse Thorn]], "to capture what makes ''WTF'' special and communicate it to folks who aren't comedy nerds—or even necessarily comedy fans." Initial station pickups include [[WBEZ]] Chicago and the Public Radio Remix service on [[SiriusXM]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://maximumfun.org/2011/05/17/wtf-public-radio-show |title=WTF: The Public Radio Show! |publisher=Maximum Fun |date= |accessdate=2012-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 6, 2012, 'WTF with Marc Maron' won the award for "Best Comedy Podcast" at the 2012 Comedy Central Comedy awards.

In [[2013 in music|2013]], Maron contributed a [[guitar solo]] to the [[protest song]] and [[charity single]] "[[Party at the NSA]]" by [[electropop]] music duo [[Yacht (band)|Yacht]]. Inspired by the [[Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)|2013 global surveillance disclosures]], "Party at the NSA" critiques the state of governmental surveillance programs in the United States.

In an interview with [[KCRW]], Maron stated "I have no idea why they asked me to play guitar on the track. I'm only good at one thing on the guitar. It just so happens it was exactly the thing they needed."&lt;ref name="kcrw"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.kcrw.com/whichwayla/2013/08/yacht-releases-anti-surveillance-manifesto-party-at-the-nsa|first=Evan|last=George|title=YACHT releases anti-surveillance manifesto ‘Party at the NSA’|work=[[KCRW]]|publisher=[[WordPress]]|accessdate=2015-09-15|date=15 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviews for the solo were positive. [[IFC (U.S. TV network)|IFC]]'s Melissa Locker said "Marc Maron plays a mean guitar."&lt;ref name="ifc"&gt;{{cite web|last=Locker|first=Melissa|url=http://www.ifc.com/shows/maron/blog/2013/08/marc-maron-yacht-party-at-the-nsa|title=Marc Maron and Yacht Have a "Party at the NSA"|work=[[IFC (U.S. TV network)|IFC]]|publisher=IFC TV LLC|accessdate=2015-09-15|date=16 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]''{{'}}s Chris Martins called the guitar solo a "shredfest" as well as "angular."&lt;ref name="spin"&gt;{{cite web|last=Martins|first=Chris|url=http://www.spin.com/2013/08/marc-maron-yacht-party-at-the-nsa-stream/|title=Hear Marc Maron Shred on YACHT’s Disco Ripper ‘Party at the NSA’|work=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|publisher=[[SpinMedia]]|accessdate=2015-09-15|date=15 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Stranger (newspaper)|The Stranger]]'' called it "a frequency-fraying guitar solo that's better than you'd expect, although it won’t make [[J Mascis]] jealous."&lt;ref name="the stranger"&gt;{{cite web|last=Segal|first=Dave|url=http://lineout.thestranger.com/lineout/archives/2013/08/20/watch-out-yachts-party-at-the-nsa|title=Watch Out!

== Personal life ==
Maron lived in [[Astoria, Queens]], through the 1990s and most of the 2000s&lt;ref name=FamilySearch-USPR-1998&gt;{{cite web|title=Marc D Maron - United States Public Records|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:KJMJ-1NB|website=[[FamilySearch]]|accessdate=8 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but moved back to Los Angeles in the fall of 2009. Maron also speaks openly of his caring for numerous stray cats that he takes into his home. This has led to him to refer to his home, on the WTF Podcast, as the "Cat Ranch." Maron lives in [[Highland Park, Los Angeles]], with his three cats, Monkey, Boomer, and LaFonda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catster.com/lifestyle/marc-maron-cat-adoption-feral|title=Marc Maron Learned the Meaning of "Feral" from a Cat|accessdate=May 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Boomer went missing, Maron began incorporating the catchphrase "Boomer lives!" into various portions of the podcast. He has a new addition to the "Cat Ranch" by the name Buster Kitten.

Maron has spoken openly, both in his act and on his podcast, about his alcohol and drug abuse during the 1990s. Maron has been sober since August 9, 1999.&lt;ref name=LeonardLopate-DarknessDepression-2014 /&gt;

Maron has been married twice, once to Kimberly Reiss and once to [[Mishna Wolff]], a former standup comedian. Both relationships have figured prominently in his act at various times. During numerous appearances at the [[Edinburgh Fringe]] festival in 2007, Maron riffed on his then-recent separation and divorce from Wolff.

On the October 14, 2013, episode of his podcast, Maron announced that he had broken up with his former fiancee, Jessica Sanchez.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episodes/episode_432_-_natasha_lyonne|title=WTF Podcast Episode 432 - Natasha Lyonne|accessdate=October 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the February 10, 2014, episode of his podcast, Maron confirmed he was dating [[Moon Zappa]] not long after she had been a guest on the podcast. However, on the May 1, 2014, episode of his podcast, Maron revealed that he was no longer dating Zappa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episodes/episode_493_-_stephen_malkmus|title=WTF Podcast Episode 493 - Stephen Malkmus|accessdate=May 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the March 2, 2015, episode of his podcast, Maron announced he was dating artist [[Sarah Cain]].
