'''Mel Brooks''' (born '''Melvin Kaminsky''';&lt;ref&gt;Parish, pp. 16–17&lt;/ref&gt; June 28, 1926) is an American filmmaker, actor, comedian, and composer. He is known as a creator of broad film [[farce]]s and comedic [[parody|parodies]]. Brooks began his career as a comic and a writer for the early TV variety show ''[[Your Show of Shows]]''. He created, with [[Buck Henry]], the hit [[television comedy]] series ''[[Get Smart]]'', which ran from 1965 to 1970.

In middle age, Brooks became one of the most successful film directors of the 1970s, with many of his films being among the top 10 moneymakers of the year they were released. His best-known films include ''[[The Producers (1967 film)|The Producers]]'', ''[[The Twelve Chairs (1970 film)|The Twelve Chairs]]'', ''[[Blazing Saddles]]'', ''[[Young Frankenstein]]'', ''[[Silent Movie]]'', ''[[High Anxiety]]'', ''[[History of the World, Part I]]'', ''[[Spaceballs]]'' and ''[[Robin Hood: Men in Tights]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pressreader.com/canada/toronto-star/20161021/281998966991887 "Just give me the premise and get out of the way"]. ''Toronto Star'', October 21, 2016.  Josh Rottenberg.&lt;/ref&gt;  A musical adaptation of his first film, ''[[The Producers (musical)|The Producers]]'', ran on Broadway, from 2001 to 2007.

In 2001, having previously won an [[Emmy Award|Emmy]], a [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] and an [[Academy Award|Oscar]], he joined a small list of [[List of persons who have won Academy, Emmy, Grammy, and Tony Awards|EGOT winners]] with his [[Tony Award]] for ''The Producers''. He received a [[Kennedy Center Honors|Kennedy Center Honor]] in 2009, a [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] star in 2010, the 41st [[AFI Life Achievement Award]] in June 2013, a [[British Film Institute Fellowship]] in March 2015, a [[National Medal of Arts]] in September 2016, and a [[BAFTA Fellowship]] in February 2017. Three of his films ranked in the [[American Film Institute]]'s list of the [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Laughs|top 100 comedy films of the past 100 years (1900–2000)]], all of which ranked in the top 15 of the list: ''Blazing Saddles'' at number 6, ''The Producers'' at number 11, and ''Young Frankenstein'' at number 13.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.afi.com/100years/laughs.aspx|title=AFI's 100 Years...100 Laughs|date=June 14, 2000 |publisher=[[American Film Institute|AFI]]|accessdate=September 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brooks was married to Oscar, Emmy, and Tony-winning actress, [[Anne Bancroft]], from 1964 until her death in 2005. Their son [[Max Brooks]] is an actor and author, known for his 2006 novel ''[[World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War]]''.

== Early life and education ==
Brooks was born Melvin Kaminsky on June 28, 1926, in [[Brooklyn, New York]], to Max (1895-1929) and Kate (née Brookman) Kaminsky (1896-1989),&lt;ref name=Susskind-JewishSon-1970&gt;{{cite web|title=How to be a Jewish Son—or—My Son the Success! |url=http://jewishjournal.com/culture/arts/67373/|work=[[David Susskind Show]]|accessdate=January 26, 2014|page=Season 12 :  Ep. 7|format=video|year=1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/35/Mel-Brooks.html|title=Mel Brooks |publisher=Filmreference.com|accessdate=November 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and grew up in [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn|Williamsburg]]. His father's family were [[History of the Jews in Germany|German Jews]] [[Jewish community of Danzig|from Danzig]] (present-day [[Gdańsk]], Poland); his mother's family were [[History of the Jews in Ukraine|Jews from Kiev]], in the [[Pale of Settlement]] of the [[History of the Jews in the Russian Empire#Russian Empire|Russian Empire]] (present-day Ukraine).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/02/16/mel-brooks-is-always-funny-and-often-wise-in-this-1975-playboy-interview.html |title=Mel Brooks Is Always Funny and Often Wise in This 1975 Playboy Interview|publisher=The Daily Beast Company LLC |date= |accessdate=July 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Jewish-World/Jewish-Features/The-cinematic-Zionism-of-Mel-Brooks |title=The cinematic Zionism of Mel Brooks|publisher=The Jerusalem Post |date=August 12, 2012 |accessdate=January 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had three older brothers: Irving, Lenny, and Bernie.&lt;ref name=Geffen&gt;{{cite AV media | people=Brooks, Mel | date= January 31, 2015  | title=Mel Brooks Live at the Geffen | medium=Television production | location=Los Angeles| publisher= Brooksfilms; distributed by [[Home Box Office]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Brooks' father died of kidney disease at 34 when Brooks was 2 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brookslyn.com/print/Adelina1980/Adelina1980.php/kidney |title=A Mel Brooks Fan Site :: Print: Adelina Magazine February 1980|website=Brookslyn.com|accessdate=May 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has said of his father's death, "There's an outrage there. I may be angry at God, or at the world, for that. And I'm sure a lot of my comedy is based on anger and hostility. Growing up in Williamsburg, I learned to clothe it in comedy to spare myself problems—like a punch in the face."&lt;ref name=Geffen /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wakeman, John 1988"&gt;Wakeman, John. ''World Film Directors'', Volume 2. The H.W. Wilson Company. 1988, pp. 162–167.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brooks was a small, sickly boy who often was bullied and teased by his classmates because of his size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.brookslyn.com/print/Adelina1980/Adelina1980.php|title=A Mel Brooks Fan Site: Print: Adelina Magazine Feb 1980|website=Brookslyn.com|accessdate=May 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up in [[Tenement#New York City|tenement housing]]. At age 9, Brooks went to a Broadway show with his uncle Joe—a taxi driver who would drive the Broadway doormen back to Brooklyn for free and was given the tickets in gratitude—and saw ''[[Anything Goes]]'' with [[William Gaxton]], [[Ethel Merman]] and [[Victor Moore]] at the [[Neil Simon Theatre|Alvin Theater]]. After the show, he told his uncle that he was not going to work in the [[Garment District, Manhattan|garment district]] like everyone else but was absolutely going into show business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Is Jerrod Carmichael the Funniest In His Family?|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqsh-wiyNBU|website=The Late Late Show with James Corden|publisher=CBS|accessdate=May 12, 2017|date=September 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was taught by [[Buddy Rich]] (who had also grown up in Williamsburg) how to play the drums and started earning money at it when he was 14.&lt;ref name="Wakeman, John 1988" /&gt;

After attending [[Abraham Lincoln High School (Brooklyn)|Abraham Lincoln High School]] for a year, Brooks graduated from [[Eastern District High School]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KNUp5E3_tTcC&amp;pg=PA114 |title=Brooklyn: A State of Mind|first1=Michael W.|last1=Robbins|first2=Wendy|last2=Palitz|publisher=[[Workman Publishing Company]]| date= 2001| accessdate=February 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then spent a year at [[Brooklyn College]] as a psychology major before being drafted into the army in 1944.&lt;ref name="Wakeman, John 1988"/&gt; He was placed in the [[Army Specialized Training Program]] and sent to the [[Virginia Military Institute]] to be taught skills such as military engineering and later underwent basic training at [[Fort Sill|Fort Sill, Oklahoma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vmi.edu/uploadedFiles/Archives/Records/World_War_II_ASTP/ASTPRoster.pdf|title=ASTP Program and Roster, World War II, VMI.|format=PDF|accessdate=May 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Weekend Edition Saturday|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=90801438|title=Mel Brooks Blazes Wacky Trail|publisher=NPR|date=May 24, 2008| accessdate=May 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served in the [[United States Army]] as a [[Corporal#United States Army|corporal]] in the 1104 Engineer Combat Battalion, [[78th Infantry Division (United States)|78th Infantry Division]], defusing land mines as the allies advanced into Germany during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Enk|first=Bryan|title=Real Life Tough Guys|url=https://movies.yahoo.com/photos/real-life-tough-guys-1374864278-slideshow/afi-life-achievement-award-a-tribute-to-mel-brooks-awards-presentation-photo-1374864255359.html|publisher=Yahoo.com|accessdate=July 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=USACE&gt;{{cite web|last=US Army|first=Corps of Engineers |title=Historical Vignette 109 – Mel Brooks Was a Combat Engineer in World War II|url=http://www.usace.army.mil/About/History/HistoricalVignettes/SportsEntertainment/109MelBrooks.aspx|accessdate=January 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
=== Early career  ===
After the war, Brooks started working in various [[Borscht Belt]] resorts and nightclubs in the [[Catskill Mountains]] as a drummer and pianist. Around this time, he changed his professional name to "Mel Brooks"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | credits=Brooks, Mel; Kimmel, Jimmy  | date=May 3, 2013 | series=[[Jimmy Kimmel Live]]| episode= 375 | season= 10| location=Los Angeles | publisher= Jackhole Productions; distributed by ABC and Chum Television}}&lt;/ref&gt; (from his mother's maiden name Brookman) after being confused with the Borscht Belt trumpet player [[Max Kaminsky (musician)|Max Kaminsky]].&lt;ref name="Wakeman, John 1988" /&gt; After a regular comic at one of the nightclubs was too sick to perform one night, Brooks started working as a stand-up comic, telling jokes and doing movie-star impressions. He also began acting in summer stock in Red Bank, New Jersey, and did some radio work.&lt;ref name="Wakeman, John 1988" /&gt; He eventually worked his way up to the comically aggressive job of [[tummler]] (master entertainer) at [[Grossinger's Catskill Resort Hotel|Grossinger's]], one of the Borscht Belt's most famous resorts.&lt;ref name="Wakeman, John 1988" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.filmscoremonthly.com/articles/2001/15_Aug---Lost_Issue_Mel_Brooks_Interview.asp |title=8/15/01: Lost Issue Mel Brooks Interview 1997 |publisher=Filmscoremonthly.com |date= |accessdate=May 4, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090918053720/http://www.filmscoremonthly.com/articles/2001/15_Aug---Lost_Issue_Mel_Brooks_Interview.asp |archivedate=September 18, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Brooks found more rewarding work behind the scenes, becoming a comedy writer for television. In 1949 his friend [[Sid Caesar]] hired Brooks to write jokes for the NBC series ''[[The Admiral Broadway Revue]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/mel-brooks-timeline-2000-years-of-mel-brooks/2593/|title=Mel Brooks {{!}} Timeline: 2000 Years of Mel Brooks {{!}} American Masters {{!}} PBS|date=February 1, 2013|work=American Masters|access-date=March 15, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; paying him $50 a week.

=== ''Your Show of Shows'' ===
In 1950 Caesar created the revolutionary variety comedy series ''[[Your Show of Shows]]'' and hired Brooks as a writer along with [[Carl Reiner]], [[Neil Simon]], [[Danny Simon]], and head writer [[Mel Tolkin]].&lt;ref name="Wakeman, John 1988" /&gt; The show was an immediate hit and has been influential to all variety and sketch-comedy TV shows since.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://brothers-ink.com/2016/02/the-amazing-writing-team-of-your-show-of-shows/|title=The Amazing Writing Team of Your Show of Shows - Brothers' Ink Productions|website=Brothers' Ink Productions|language=en-US|access-date=March 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reiner, as creator of ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]'', based [[Morey Amsterdam]]'s character Buddy Sorell on Brooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.neatorama.com/2017/01/26/13-Things-You-Didnt-know-about-The-Dick-Van-Dyke-Show/|title=13 Things You Didn't Know About The Dick Van Dyke Show|work=Neatorama|access-date=March 15, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the 1982 film ''[[My Favorite Year]]'' is loosely based on Brooks' experiences as a writer on the show and an encounter with aging [[Hollywood]] actor [[Errol Flynn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/us/movies/my-favorite-year/253706/my-favorite-year-a-mirror-for-errol-flynn-peter-otooles-hellraising|title=My Favorite Year: A Mirror for Errol Flynn &amp; Peter O'Toole's Hellraising|work=Den of Geek|access-date=March 15, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neil Simon's 1993 play ''[[Laughter on the 23rd Floor]]'' is also loosely based on the production of the show, and the character Ira Stone is based on Brooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/1993/legit/reviews/laughter-on-the-23rd-floor-1200434229/|title=Laughter on the 23rd Floor|last=Gerard|first=Jeremy|date=November 23, 1993|work=Variety|access-date=March 15, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tennessean.com/story/life/arts/2017/11/15/review-act-1-delivers-plenty-laughter-23rd-floor/864200001/|title=Review: ACT 1 delivers plenty of 'Laughter on the 23rd Floor'|work=The Tennessean|access-date=March 15, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;''Your Show of Shows'' ended in 1954 when performer [[Imogene Coca]] left to host her own show.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/06/03/nyregion/imogene-coca-92-is-dead-a-partner-in-one-of-tv-s-most-successful-comedy-teams.html|title=Imogene Coca, 92, Is Dead; a Partner in One of TV's Most Successful Comedy Teams|last=McFadden|first=Robert D.|date=June 3, 2001|work=The New York Times|access-date=March 15, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caesar then created ''[[Caesar's Hour]]'' with most of the same cast and writers (including Brooks and adding [[Larry Gelbart]]).

=== ''[[The 2000 Year Old Man]]'' and ''Get Smart'' ===
Brooks and co-writer Reiner had become fast friends and began to casually improvise comedy routines when they were not working. Reiner would play the straight man interviewer who would set Brooks up as anything from a Tibetan monk to an astronaut. As Reiner explained, "In the evening, we'd go to a party and I'd pick a character for him to play. I never told him what it was going to be."&lt;ref name="Wakeman, John 1988" /&gt; On one of these occasions, Reiner's suggestion was a 2000-year-old man who had witnessed the crucifixion of Jesus Christ (who "came in the store but never bought anything"), had been married several hundred times, and had "over forty-two thousand children, and not one comes to visit me." At first Brooks and Reiner would only perform the routine for friends, but by the late 1950s, it had gained a cult status in New York City. [[Kenneth Tynan]] saw the [[comedy duo]] perform at a party in 1959 and wrote that Brooks "was the most original comic improvisor I had ever seen."&lt;ref name="Wakeman, John 1988" /&gt;

In 1960, Brooks moved from New York to Hollywood. He and Reiner began performing the "2000 Year Old Man" act on ''[[the Steve Allen Show]]''. Their performances led to the release of the comedy album ''2000 Years with Carl Reiner and Mel Brooks'' that sold over a million copies in 1961.&lt;ref name="Wakeman, John 1988" /&gt; They eventually expanded their routine with two more albums in 1961 and 1962, a revival in 1973, a 1975 animated TV special, and a reunion album in 1998. At one point, when Brooks had financial and career struggles, the record sales from the 2000 Year Old Man were his chief source of income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/02/16/mel-brooks-is-always-funny-and-often-wise-in-this-1975-playboy-interview.html|title=Mel Brooks Is Always Funny and Often Wise in This 1975 Playboy Interview|first=Alex|last=Belth|date=February 16, 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brooks adapted the 2000 Year Old Man character to create the 2500 Year Old Brewmaster for [[Ballantine Beer]] in the 1960s. Interviewed by [[Dick Cavett]] in a series of ads, the Brewmaster (in a German accent, as opposed to the 2000 Year Old Man's Yiddish accent) said he was inside the original Trojan horse and "could've used a six-pack of fresh air. "&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ysos.sammigirl.com/interviews/playboy1966.html |title=Mel Brooks Interviewed in Playboy, 1966 |publisher=Ysos.sammigirl.com |date= |accessdate=November 1, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512095922/http://ysos.sammigirl.com/interviews/playboy1966.html |archivedate=May 12, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, Brooks wrote the Broadway musical ''[[All American (musical)|All American]]''. Brooks wrote the play with lyrics by [[Lee Adams]], and music by [[Charles Strouse]]. The show starred [[Ray Bolger]] as a southern science professor at a large university who uses the principles of engineering on the college's football team and the team begins to win games. The show was directed by [[Joshua Logan]], whose script doctored the second act and added a gay subtext to the plot. The show ran for 80 performances and received two [[Tony Award]] nominations.

In 1963, Brooks was involved in the animated short film ''[[The Critic (film)|The Critic]]'', a satire of arty, esoteric cinema, conceived by Brooks and directed by [[Ernest Pintoff]]. Brooks supplied running commentary as the baffled moviegoer trying to make sense of the obscure visuals. The short film won the [[Academy Award for Animated Short Film]].

In 1965, Brooks teamed up with comedy writer [[Buck Henry]] to create a comedic TV show about a bumbling [[James Bond]]-inspired spy. Brooks explains, "I was sick of looking at all those nice sensible situation comedies. They were such distortions of life... I wanted to do a crazy, unreal [[comic-strip]] kind of thing about something besides a family. No one had ever done a show about an idiot before. I decided to be the first."&lt;ref name="time1965"&gt;{{cite news|title=Smart Money|url=http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,834525,00.html|work=Time|date=October 15, 1965|accessdate=August 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show that Brooks and Henry created was ''[[Get Smart]]'', starring [[Don Adams]] as Maxwell Smart, Agent 86. This series ran from 1965 until 1970, although Brooks was not involved with its production after the pilot episode. ''Get Smart'' was highly rated for most of its production and won seven [[Emmy Awards]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/mel-brooks|title=Mel Brooks Emmy Nominated|publisher=Emmys.com|accessdate=November 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; including Outstanding Comedy Series in 1968 and 1969.

=== Early career as a film director ===
For several years, Brooks had been toying with a bizarre and unconventional idea about a musical comedy of [[Adolf Hitler]]. Brooks explored the idea as a novel and a play before finally writing a script.&lt;ref name="Wakeman, John 1988" /&gt; Eventually, he was able to find two producers to fund the show, [[Joseph E. Levine]] and [[Sidney Glazier]], and made his first feature film, ''[[The Producers (1967 film)|The Producers]]'', in 1967.

''The Producers'' was so brazen in its satire that major studios would not touch it, nor would many exhibitors. Brooks finally found an independent distributor who released it as an art film, a specialized attraction. In 1968, Brooks received an Oscar for [[Best Original Screenplay]] for the film, beating such writers as [[Stanley Kubrick]] and [[John Cassavetes]]. ''The Producers'' became a smash underground hit, first on the nationwide [[college circuit]], then in revivals and on home video. Brooks later turned it into a [[The Producers (musical)|musical]], which became hugely successful on Broadway, receiving an unprecedented twelve Tony awards.

With the moderate financial success of the film ''The Producers'', Glazier financed Brooks' next film in 1970, ''[[The Twelve Chairs (1970 film)|The Twelve Chairs]]''. Loosely based on a Russian 1928 novel ''[[The Twelve Chairs]]'' by [[Ilf and Petrov]] about greedy materialism in post-revolutionary Russia, the film stars [[Ron Moody]], [[Frank Langella]], and [[Dom DeLuise]] as three men individually searching for a fortune in diamonds hidden in a set of 12 antique chairs. Brooks makes a cameo appearance as an alcoholic ex-serf who "yearns for the regular beatings of yesteryear." The film was shot in Yugoslavia with a budget of $1.5 million. The film received poor reviews and was not financially successful.&lt;ref name="Wakeman, John 1988" /&gt;

=== Success as a Hollywood director ===
Brooks then wrote an adaptation of [[Oliver Goldsmith]]'s ''[[She Stoops to Conquer]]'', but was unable to sell the idea to any studio and believed that his career was over. In 1972, Brooks met agent [[David Begelman]], who helped him set up a deal with [[Warner Brothers]] to hire Brooks (as well as [[Richard Pryor]], [[Andrew Bergman]], Norman Steinberg, and Al Uger) as a script doctor for an unproduced script called ''Tex-X''. Eventually, Brooks was hired as director for what would become ''[[Blazing Saddles]]'', his third film.&lt;ref name="Wakeman, John 1988"/&gt;

''Blazing Saddles'' starred [[Cleavon Little]], [[Gene Wilder]], [[Harvey Korman]], [[Slim Pickens]], [[Madeline Kahn]], [[Alex Karras]], and Brooks himself, with cameos by [[Dom DeLuise]] and [[Count Basie]]. The film had music by Brooks and John Morris, and received a modest budget of $2.6 million. This film is a satire on the [[Western film]] genre and references older films such as ''[[Destry Rides Again]]'', ''[[High Noon]]'', ''[[Once Upon a Time in the West]]'', and ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'', as well as a surreal scene towards the end of the film referencing the extravagant musicals of [[Busby Berkeley]].

Upon its release, ''Blazing Saddles'' was the second-highest US grossing film of 1974, earning $119.5 million worldwide. Despite mixed reviews, the film was a success with younger audiences. It was nominated for three [[Academy Awards]]: [[Academy Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role|Best Actress in a Supporting Role]] for Madeline Kahn, [[Academy Award for Film Editing|Best Film Editing]], and [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Music, Original Song]]. The film won the [[Writers Guild of America Award]] for "[[Writers Guild of America Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Comedy Written Directly for the Screen]]" and in 2006 it was deemed "culturally, historically or aesthetically significant" by the [[Library of Congress]] and was selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]]. Brooks has said that the film "has to do with love more than anything else. I mean when that black guy rides into that Old Western town and even a little old lady says 'Up yours, nigger!', you know that his heart is broken. So it's really the story of that heart being mended."&lt;ref name="Wakeman, John 1988"/&gt;

When Gene Wilder replaced [[Gig Young]] as the Waco Kid, he did so only if Brooks agreed that his next film would be an idea that Wilder had been working on: a spoof of the old Universal Studios ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]'' films. After the filming of ''Blazing Saddles'' was completed, Wilder and Brooks began writing the script for ''[[Young Frankenstein]]'' and shot the film in the spring of 1974. It starred Wilder, [[Marty Feldman]], [[Peter Boyle]], [[Teri Garr]], [[Madeline Kahn]], [[Cloris Leachman]] and [[Kenneth Mars]], with [[Gene Hackman]] in a cameo role. Brooks' voice can be heard three times, first as the wolf howl when the characters are on their way to the castle, second as the voice of Victor Frankenstein when the characters discover the laboratory, and third as the cat sound when Gene Wilder accidentally throws a dart out of the window in a scene with Kenneth Mars. Composer [[John Morris (composer)|John Morris]] again provided the music score and [[Universal monsters]] film special effects veteran [[Kenneth Strickfaden]] worked on the film.

''Young Frankenstein'' was the third-highest-grossing film domestically of 1974, just behind ''Blazing Saddles''. It earned $86 million worldwide and received two Academy Award nominations: [[Academy Award for Writing Adapted Screenplay]] and [[Academy Award for Best Sound]]. It received some of the best reviews of Brooks' career and even critic [[Pauline Kael]] liked the film, saying: "Brooks makes a leap up as a director because, although the comedy doesn't build, he carries the story through...Brooks even has a satisfying windup, which makes this just about the only comedy of recent years that doesn't collapse."&lt;ref name="Wakeman, John 1988" /&gt;

In 1975, at the height of his movie career, Brooks tried TV again with ''[[When Things Were Rotten]]'', a [[Robin Hood]] parody that lasted only 13 episodes. Nearly 20 years later, in response to the 1991 hit film ''[[Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves]]'', Brooks mounted another Robin Hood parody in 1993 with ''[[Robin Hood: Men in Tights]]''. Brooks' film resurrected several pieces of dialogue from his TV series, as well as from earlier Brooks films.

In 1976, Brooks followed up his two hit films with an audacious idea: the first feature-length silent comedy in four decades. ''[[Silent Movie]]'' was written by Brooks and [[Ron Clark (writer)|Ron Clark]], starring Brooks in his first leading role, Dom DeLuise, Marty Feldman, [[Sid Caesar]], [[Bernadette Peters]], and in cameo roles playing themselves: [[Paul Newman]], [[Burt Reynolds]], [[James Caan]], [[Liza Minnelli]], [[Anne Bancroft]], and with brilliant irony, [[Marcel Marceau]], the man who never speaks, who uttered the film's only word of audible dialogue: "Non!"

Although not as successful as his previous two films, ''Silent Movie'' was a hit and grossed $36 million. Later that year, Brooks was named number 5 on a list of the Top Ten Box Office Stars.&lt;ref name="Wakeman, John 1988" /&gt;

In 1977, Brooks made a parody of the films of [[Alfred Hitchcock]] in ''[[High Anxiety]]''. The film was written by Brooks, Ron Clark, [[Rudy De Luca]], and [[Barry Levinson]] and was the first movie produced by Brooks himself. It starred Brooks, Madeline Kahn, [[Cloris Leachman]], Harvey Korman, [[Ron Carey (actor)|Ron Carey]], [[Howard Morris]], and [[Dick Van Patten]]. The film satirizes such Hitchcock classic films as ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'', ''[[Spellbound (1945 film)|Spellbound]]'', ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', ''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]]'', ''[[North by Northwest]]'', ''[[Dial M for Murder]]'', and ''[[Suspicion (1941 film)|Suspicion]]''. Brooks stars as Professor Richard H. (for Harpo) Thorndyke, a [[Nobel Prize]]-winning psychologist who also happens to suffer from "[[acrophobia|high anxiety]]".&lt;ref name="Wakeman, John 1988" /&gt;

=== Later film career ===
[[File:Mel Brooks.jpg|thumb|Brooks, ''circa'' February 1984]]
By 1980 ''[[Sneak Previews|Siskel and Ebert]]'' called Mel Brooks and [[Woody Allen]] "the two most successful comedy directors in the world today ... America's two funniest filmmakers."&lt;ref name="siskelebert"&gt;{{cite episode| title=Take 2: Who's Funnier: Mel Brooks or Woody Allen?|series=Sneak Previews|credits=Siskel, Gene; Ebert, Roger |network=PBS|location=Chicago |airdate=1980-05-01|season=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year, Brooks produced the dramatic film ''[[The Elephant Man (film)|The Elephant Man]]'' (directed by [[David Lynch]]). Knowing that anyone seeing a poster reading "Mel Brooks presents ''The Elephant Man''" would expect a comedy, he set up the company [[List of Brooksfilms productions|Brooksfilms]]. Brooksfilms has since produced a number of non-comedy films, including [[David Cronenberg]]'s ''[[The Fly (1986 film)|The Fly]]'', ''[[Frances (film)|Frances]]'', and ''[[84 Charing Cross Road (film)|84 Charing Cross Road]]'', starring [[Anthony Hopkins]] and Anne Bancroft, along with comedies, including [[Richard Benjamin]]'s ''[[My Favorite Year]]'', which was partially based on Mel Brooks' real life. Brooks sought to purchase the rights to ''84 Charing Cross Road'' for his wife, Anne Bancroft, for many years. He also produced the comedy ''[[Fatso (1980 film)|Fatso]]'' that Anne Bancroft directed.

In 1981, Brooks joked that the only genres that he had not spoofed were historical epics and Biblical spectacles.&lt;ref name="Wakeman, John 1988" /&gt; ''[[History of the World Part I]]'' was a tongue-in-cheek look at human culture from the [[Stone Age|Dawn of Man]] to the [[French Revolution]]. The film was written, produced, and directed by Brooks with narration by [[Orson Welles]]. This film was another modest financial hit, earning $31 million. It received mixed critical reviews. Critic Pauline Kael, who for years had been critical of Brooks, said: "Either you get stuck thinking about the bad taste or you let yourself laugh at the obscenity in the humor as you do [[Luis Buñuel|Buñuel]]'s perverse dirty jokes."&lt;ref name="Wakeman, John 1988" /&gt;

In 1983, Brooks produced and starred in (but did not write or direct) a remake of the classic 1942 [[Ernst Lubitsch]] [[To Be or Not to Be (1942 film)|film]]. ''[[To Be or Not to Be (1983 film)|To Be or Not to Be]]'' was directed by [[Alan Johnson (choreographer)|Alan Johnson]] and starred Brooks, Anne Bancroft, [[Charles Durning]], [[Tim Matheson]], [[Jose Ferrer]], and [[Christopher Lloyd]]. The film garnered international publicity by featuring a controversial song on its soundtrack – "[[To Be or Not to Be (The Hitler Rap)]] – satirizing German society in the 1940s with Brooks playing Hitler.

The second movie Brooks directed in the 1980s came in 1987 in the form of ''[[Spaceballs]]'', a parody of [[science fiction]], mainly ''[[Star Wars]]''. The film starred [[Bill Pullman]], [[John Candy]], [[Rick Moranis]], [[Daphne Zuniga]], Dick Van Patten, [[Joan Rivers]], Dom DeLuise, and Brooks. In 1989, Brooks (with co-executive producer [[Alan Spencer]]) made another attempt at television success with the sitcom ''[[The Nutt House]]'', which featured Brooks regulars Harvey Korman and Cloris Leachman and was originally broadcast on NBC, but the network only aired five of the eleven episodes produced before canceling the series. In the 1990s, Brooks directed ''[[Life Stinks]]'' (1991), ''[[Robin Hood: Men in Tights]]'' (1993), and ''[[Dracula: Dead and Loving It]]'' (1995). [[People Magazine|''People'']] suggested, "anyone in a mood for a hearty laugh couldn't do better than ''Robin Hood: Men in Tights'', which gave fans a parody of [[Robin Hood]], especially ''[[Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves]]''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20105999,00.html |title=Picks and Pans Review: Robin Hood: Men in Tights |work=[[People (magazine)|People]]|first1= Ralph |last1= Novak | first2= Tom |last2= Gliatto| first3= Leah |last3= Rozen |date= August 9, 1993|volume= 40| number= 6| accessdate= July 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like Brooks' other films, it is filled with classic one-liners, and even the occasional breaking of the fourth wall. ''Robin Hood: Men in Tights'' was Brooks' second time exploring the life of Robin Hood, the first, as mentioned above, having been with his 1975 TV show, ''When Things Were Rotten.'' ''Life Stinks'' was a financial and critical failure, but is notable as being the only film that Brooks directed that is neither a parody nor a film about other films or theater. (''The Twelve Chairs'' was actually a parody of the original novel.) In the 2000s, Brooks worked on an [[animated series]] [[sequel]] to ''Spaceballs'' called ''[[Spaceballs: The Animated Series]],'' which premiered on September 21, 2008, on [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4 TV]]. Brooks has also supplied vocal roles for animation. He voiced Bigweld the master inventor, in the 2005 animated film ''[[Robots (2005 film)|Robots]]'' and the 2014 animated film ''[[Mr. Peabody &amp; Sherman]]'' and had a cameo appearance as [[Albert Einstein]]. He returned, to voice Dracula's father, Vlad, in ''[[Hotel Transylvania 2]]'' (2015)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/11/25/mel-brooks-hotel-transylvania-2-movie-sneak-peek/19193423/|title=Mel Brooks checks in for 'Hotel Transylvania 2'|first= Brian |last= Truitt|date=November 25, 2014|work=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=July 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation]]'' (2018).

=== Musicals ===
[[File:Mel Brooks Anne Bancroft 1991.jpg|thumb|left|Brooks with wife [[Anne Bancroft]] at the [[1991 Cannes Film Festival]]]]
One of his most recent successes has been the [[The Producers (musical)|musical adaptation]] of his film ''[[The Producers (1967 film)|The Producers]]'' to the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] stage. The show broke the Tony record with 12 wins, a record that had previously been held for 37 years by ''[[Hello, Dolly! (musical)|Hello, Dolly!]]'' at 10 wins. This success led to a [[The Producers (2005 film)|big-screen version]] of the Broadway adaptation/remake with actors [[Matthew Broderick]] and [[Nathan Lane]] reprising their stage roles, in addition to new cast members [[Uma Thurman]] and [[Will Ferrell]] in 2005. In early April 2006, Brooks began [[musical composition|composing]] the score to a Broadway [[Young Frankenstein (musical)|musical adaptation of ''Young Frankenstein'']], which he says is "perhaps the best movie [he] ever made. " The world premiere was performed at Seattle's Paramount Theater, between August 7, 2007, and September 1, 2007, after which it opened on Broadway at the former [[Lyric Theatre (1998 New York City)|Lyric Theater]] (then the Hilton Theatre), New York, on October 11, 2007. It earned mixed reviews from the critics.

Brooks joked about the concept of a musical adaptation of ''Blazing Saddles'' in the final number in ''Young Frankenstein'', in which the full company sings, "next year, ''Blazing Saddles''!" In 2010, Mel Brooks confirmed this, saying that the musical could be finished within a year. No creative team or plan has been announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/137884-Back-on-the-Horse-Mel-Brooks-Penning-Songs-for-Blazing-Saddles- |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120906082545/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/137884-Back-on-the-Horse-Mel-Brooks-Penning-Songs-for-Blazing-Saddles- |dead-url=yes |archive-date=September 6, 2012 |title=Back on the Horse: Mel Brooks Penning Songs for Blazing Saddles Musical |work=Playbill |date=March 16, 2010 |accessdate=November 1, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He won his three Tony awards in 2001 for his work on the musical, ''The Producers'' for Best Musical, Best Original Musical Score, and Best Book of a Musical.

== Personal life ==
[[File:MaxMelBrooksApr10.jpg|thumb|left|Brooks with son [[Max Brooks|Max]] in April 2010]]

In 2010, Brooks credited Bancroft with having been "the guiding force" behind his involvement in developing ''The Producers'' and ''[[Young Frankenstein (musical)|Young Frankenstein]]'' for the musical theater, saying of an early meeting with her: "From that day, until her death…we were glued together."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/02/03/mel-brooks-remembers-love_n_448180.html|title=Mel Brooks Remembers Love Anne Bancroft: 'We Were Glued Together' |first=John|last=Carucci|date=February 3, 2010 |agency=[[Associated Press|AP]] |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |accessdate=September 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding religion, Brooks stated, "I'm rather secular. I'm basically Jewish. But I think I'm Jewish not because of the Jewish religion at all.
