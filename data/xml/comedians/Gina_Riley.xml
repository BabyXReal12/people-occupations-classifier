'''Gina Riley''' (born 6 May 1961) is an Australian actress, writer, singer and comedian.

==Television and film==
Riley became a popular television performer in the sketch shows ''[[Fast Forward (TV series)|Fast Forward]]'', its successor ''[[Full Frontal (Australian TV series)|Full Frontal]]'', ''[[Big Girl's Blouse]]'' and ''[[Something Stupid (TV series)|Something Stupid]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, Tonya: [http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,,24750164-5003423,00.html Gina Riley leaves Kim for a spell in Chicago], ''[[The Courier-Mail]]'', 5 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In the latter she was also a producer and writer. On ''Fast Forward'', Gina Riley sent-up such singers as [[Tina Arena]],  [[Paula Abdul]], [[Bette Midler]], [[Sinéad O'Connor]] and [[Dannii Minogue]] as well as Australian personalities [[Kerri-Anne Kennerley]] and [[Jacki MacDonald]]. She later appeared in ''[[The Games (television)|The Games]]'', a spoof behind-the-scenes look at the organising committee of the [[2000 Summer Olympics|Sydney Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/tv/thegames/about.htm Games Management Team], ''[[The Games (television)|The Games]]'' ([[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

She has enjoyed great success as Kim Craig and Trude in ''[[Kath &amp; Kim (Australian TV series)|Kath &amp; Kim]]'', written, produced and created by Riley and her long-time writing partner and friend [[Jane Turner]]. Riley also works frequently with [[Magda Szubanski]].&lt;ref&gt;Quinn, Karl: [http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/09/12/1063341759464.html The Magda carta], ''[[The Age]]'', 14 September 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to the rest of her cast (such as [[Glenn Robbins]], [[Peter Rowsthorn (actor)|Peter Rowsthorn]] and Magda Szubanski), Riley makes relatively few public appearances as herself. Most of the time she appears in character as Kim, with Jane Turner. One notable exception was on ''[[Enough Rope]]'' with [[Andrew Denton]], where she and Turner both appeared as themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/tv/enoughrope/transcripts/s912721.htm Jane Turner and Gina Riley (Kath and Kim)], ''[[Enough Rope]]'' with [[Andrew Denton]], [[ABC1|ABC TV]], 28 July 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Riley starred as Kim in the Kath and Kim feature film ''[[Kath &amp; Kimderella]]''.  The film opened in Australia on 6 September 2012 and despite negative reviews from critics it was a box office success having grossed $6,150,771.

==Stage==
In 1987, she played the part of 'Chrissie' (loosely based on rock singer [[Chrissy Amphlett]]) in Phil Motherwell's musical play 'Fitzroy Crossing' which enjoyed successful seasons and rave reviews at [[La Mama Theatre (Melbourne)|LaMama Theatre]], in [[Carlton, Victoria]]. The music for the play was composed by [[Joe Dolce]].

Riley has also had some roles in musical theatre.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ausstage.edu.au/pages/contributor/3812 AusStage - Gina Riley] AusStage. Retrieved 22 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992 and 1993, she appeared on stage as Janet in ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show|The New Rocky Horror Show]]''; she is included on the cast album.  In 1994, she played Trina in [[Sydney Theatre Company]]'s production of ''[[Falsettos]]'', winning a [[Green Room Award for Best Female Actor in a Leading Role (Music Theatre)|Green Room Award]] for its Melbourne season.  In 1998, she played The Baker's Wife in a [[Melbourne Theatre Company]] production of ''[[Into the Woods]]''. In 2009, she played Matron "Mama" Morton in a production of ''[[Chicago (musical)|Chicago]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,24642365-5012980,00.html "Gina Riley takes on Chicago role"]. The Courier-Mail.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Riley is married to Rick McKenna and they have a daughter named Maggie (born 1996),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Minchin, Nel (director) |date=26 November 2017 |title=Making Muriel |trans-title= |type=Television production |language=English |url= |access-date=27 November 2017 |archive-url= |archive-date= |format= |time=37:40 |location= |publisher= |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote=I was... born in 1996. |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt; who is also an actress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/sydney-confidential/kath-and-kim-star-gina-rileys-daughter-maggie-mckenna-lands-dorky-role-in-muriels-wedding/news-story/bd75dd23cba6a9141cd23ccba4fcc11d |title=Kath and Kim star Gina Riley’s daughter Maggie McKenna lands dorky role in Muriel’s Wedding |last=Fortescue |first=Elizabeth |date=June 14, 2017 |website= |publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]] |access-date=July 17, 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013, Riley revealed she was being treated for breast cancer, following the discovery of a tumour during a yearly check-up late in 2012. However she reported that it was found early enough to be easily treated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Kath--Kim-star-Gina-Riley-battling-breast-cancer/tabid/418/articleID/290871/Default.aspx |work=3 News NZ |title= Kath &amp; Kim star battling cancer| date=19 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
