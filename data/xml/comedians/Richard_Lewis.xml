'''Richard Philip Lewis''' (born June 29, 1947) is an American stand-up comedian and actor.

He came to prominence in the 1980s as a comedian specializing in self-deprecating humor before turning to acting. He is known for co-starring in the comedy series ''[[Anything but Love]]'' (1989-92) and for his recurring and semi-autobiographical role in ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'' (2000-present).

==Early life==
Richard Lewis was born in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and was raised in [[Englewood, New Jersey|Englewood]], [[New Jersey]]. His father worked as a caterer and his mother was an actress. The Lewises are [[Jew]]ish&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Firestone|first=Jay|url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/arts/article/richard_lewis_comedian_from_heaven_20080314/|title=Richard Lewis, comedian from heaven|work=[[The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles]]|quote = But his sense of disconnect could just as easily be attributed to his Jewish upbringing in New Jersey.|date=2008-03-13|accessdate=2010-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; but not especially religious.&lt;ref name= veteran&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.juf.org/news/local.aspx?id=417463|title= Veteran comics Susie Essman and Richard Lewis to bring the laughs to JUF’s Vanguard Nov. 5|work= juf.org | publisher= Jewish United Fund| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170729093839/http://www.juf.org/news/local.aspx?id=417463 | archive-date= July 29, 2017| first= Cindy | last= Sher| date= October 4, 2012| deadurl= yes | accessdate= June 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis recalls his childhood antics at school as a [[class clown]] resulted in negative reactions from teachers at times.&lt;ref name= veteran /&gt;

Lewis attended [[Ohio State University]]. He was a member of the Eta chapter of [[Alpha Epsilon Pi]] fraternity during his time in college.

==Career==
Lewis began performing [[stand-up comedy]] in the 1970s. He worked as a [[Copywriting|copywriter]] for an ad agency by day, while honing his stand-up act at night. The ad agency was named Contemporary Graphics (now defunct) and was located above Lovey's pizzeria in Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey. Lewis gained popularity in the 1980s with numerous appearances on ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'' and his own [[television special]]s on [[HBO]]. He is noted for always wearing an all-black outfit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://observer.com/2007/02/richard-lewis-the-metamorphosis/ | last= Fine | first= Marshall | title= Richard Lewis: The Metamorphosis | work= The New York Observer | date= February 25, 2007 | access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lewis made his acting debut in ''[[Diary of a Young Comic]]''. He co-starred with [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] on the TV sitcoms ''[[Anything but Love]]'', which ran for four seasons, and with [[Don Rickles]] on ''[[Daddy Dearest]]''. Lewis had a [[recurring role]] in ''[[Rude Awakening (TV series)|Rude Awakening]]'' and as Rabbi Richard Glass in ''[[7th Heaven (TV series)|7th Heaven]]''. He appears in the ''[[Tales from the Crypt (TV series)|Tales from the Crypt]]'' episode "Whirlpool." In 2007, he made a cameo appearance as Phillip in ''[[George Lopez (TV series)|George Lopez]]''. Recently, he also made cameos in ''[[Everybody Hates Chris]]'' as an old man in the hospital bed next to [[Chris Rock]] and as [[Charlie Sheen]]'s accountant in ''[[Two and a Half Men]]''.

Lewis has written comic articles for magazines such as ''[[Playboy]]'' and endorsed the popular early-1990s beverage [[Boku (juice)|Boku]], as well as [[Snapple]] and [[Certs]] breath mints.

Lewis has achieved moderate success in films, appearing as [[John of England|Prince John]] in ''[[Robin Hood: Men in Tights]]'', as a frontier doctor in ''[[Wagons East!]]'', as an unemployed actor in ''[[Once Upon A Crime]]'' and as himself in ''[[The Wrong Guys]]''. He plays the lead role of Jimmy Epstein in ''[[Drunks (film)|Drunks]]'' and in ''[[Game Day (movie)|Game Day]]''. Although most of his performances are in comedy, Lewis also appears in the dramatic films ''[[Leaving Las Vegas]]'', ''[[Hugo Pool]]'', and ''[[The Maze (1997 film)|The Maze]]''.

On January 9, 2001, Lewis visited ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'' to promote his book ''The Other Great Depression'', which described his recovery from [[alcoholism]]. Lewis has been sober since August 4, 1994.

He had a frequent recurring role as a character based on himself in ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]''. [[Larry David]] and Lewis met at [[summer camp]] in [[Cornwall-on-Hudson, New York]] when they were 13.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0by1eaJJ96E&amp;feature=PlayList&amp;p=CCA7829EA1851A41&amp;index=1|title=Curb Your Enthusiasm: Larry David On Richard Lewis (Paley Center, 2002)|date=10 December 2008|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Lewis is ranked #45 on [[Comedy Central]]'s list of "100 Greatest Standups of All Time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.listology.com/list/comedy-central-100-greatest-standups-all-time|title=Comedy Central 100 Greatest Standups of all Time|work=listology.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lewis claims to be the originator of the phrase "The ______ from hell" as in "the night from hell", "the date from hell" or "the roommate from hell". This theory is expounded in the ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'' episode "The Nanny from Hell". Lewis has petitioned the editors of [[Bartlett's Familiar Quotations|Bartlett's]] to be given credit for the coinage, but the editors claim that the phrase was a common idiom prior to Lewis's use of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last= Flamm| first= Matthew | url= http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,384097,00.html | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090718060749/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,384097,00.html | title= Between the Lines | work= [[Entertainment Weekly]] | date= November 1, 2002 | accessdate= December 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; (For example, during [[World War I]], kilted Scottish soldiers were given the nickname [[Black Watch|"The Ladies from Hell"]] (translation of German "Die Damen aus der Hölle") by German troops. A short story, “The Man from Hell”, by John Russell Fearn was published in ''Fantastic Adventures'' in 1939.) However, the ''[[Yale Book of Quotations]]'' attributes the phrase to Lewis.&lt;ref&gt; [http://yalepress.typepad.com/yalepresslog/2006/10/yale_gives_rich.html Yale Press Log: Yale Gives Richard Lewis Hell] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080603034014/http://yalepress.typepad.com/yalepresslog/2006/10/yale_gives_rich.html |date=2008-06-03 }}, 2006-10-11.
