'''Antonio "Tony" Rosato'''&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/15/arts/television/tony-rosato-of-1981-82-saturday-night-live-cast-dies-at-62.html| title=Tony Rosato, of 1981-82 ‘Saturday Night Live’ Cast, Dies at 62| work=[[The New York Times]]| date=January 15, 2017| accessdate=January 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (December 26, 1954 – January 10, 2017) was an Italian-Canadian actor, voice actor and comedian who appeared in television and films. He was best known as a cast member on both ''[[Second City Television|SCTV]]'' and ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', and for voicing [[Luigi]] in ''[[The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' and ''[[Super Mario World (TV series)|Super Mario World]]''.

==Early years and career beginnings==
Rosato was born in [[Naples]], Italy, and came to Canada at age 4. He was raised in [[City of Halifax|Halifax]], [[Ottawa]], and [[Toronto]]. He graduated from [[Oakwood Collegiate Institute]]. He planned to study [[chiropractic]] medicine, but dropped out of the [[University of Toronto]] after he began doing [[improv comedy]] at [[The Second City]].&lt;ref name=jokester /&gt;

==Career==
Rosato first gained attention when he and [[Robin Duke]] joined the cast of the first incarnation of ''[[Second City Television|SCTV]]'' in its final season during the fall of 1980. His most well-known character on the program was the notoriously drunk TV chef Marcello Sebastiani.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| date=January 11, 2017| title=Tony Rosato, Canadian ‘Saturday Night Live’ and ‘SCTV’ alum, dead at 62| url=http://globalnews.ca/news/3175169/tony-rosato-canadian-saturday-night-live-and-sctv-alum-dead-at-62/| publisher=[[Global News]]| accessdate=January 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rosato then moved with Duke to the cast of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' for the 1981–82 season. Following [[Jean Doumanian]]'s tenure during the sixth season and [[Dick Ebersol]] trying to retool the show (and relying on [[Eddie Murphy]] and [[Joe Piscopo]] to spice up the sketches),&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;  Rosato only appeared on the show for one year before leaving due to differences with Ebersol and an expired contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1=Hill| first1=Doug| last2=Weingrad| first2=Jeff |date=December 15, 2011| title=Saturday Night: A Backstage History of Saturday Night Live| publisher=Untreed Reads| isbn=978-1611877090}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rosato is one of three ''SCTV'' cast members to appear on ''Saturday Night Live''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/tony-rosato-snl-second-city-obit-1.3931938| title=Tony Rosato, cast member on both SNL and SCTV, dead at 62| publisher=[[CBC News]]| accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Celebrities impersonated by Rosato on ''[[Second City Television|SCTV]]'' include: [[Lou Costello]] (whom he also impersonated when he was a cast member on ''Saturday Night Live''), [[William Conrad]], [[Danny Thomas]], Woodstock co-organizer [[Chip Monck]], SNL cast member [[John Belushi]], [[Tony Orlando]] and [[Ella Fitzgerald]]. His characters on ''[[Saturday Night Live|SNL]],'' despite his short tenure, were memorable as well, and included [[Ed Asner]] (in character as Lou Grant), [[Captain Kangaroo]], and U.S. Attorney General [[Ed Meese]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://thelaughbutton.com/in-memoriam/tony-rosato-former-saturday-night-live-cast-member-passes-62/|title=Tony Rosato, former "Saturday Night Live" cast member passes at 62| publisher=The Laugh Button| accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, he starred as Aldo, the busboy in the short-lived [[Bea Arthur]] series, ''[[Amanda's]]''. The show was based on ''[[Fawlty Towers]]'' but was not well-received by audiences and was cancelled after 10 episodes.

Rosato next appeared on the Canadian police drama ''[[Night Heat]]'', playing Arthur "Whitey" Morelli&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Freed| first=Dale Anne| date=May 4, 2008| title=Tragedy continues for comic Tony Rosato| url=https://www.thestar.com/news/ontario/2008/05/04/tragedy_continues_for_comic_tony_rosato.html| newspaper=Toronto Star| accessdate=January 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; from 1985 through 1989. He continued to appear in television and film throughout the 1990s.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

===Voice work===
In autumn of 1990, Rosato portrayed [[Nintendo]]'s character [[Luigi]] on [[DiC Entertainment|DiC]]'s television show ''[[The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' (based on ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'').&lt;ref name=Voice/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=Rouner, Jef| date=October 30, 2013| title=10 Things You Probably Didn't Know About Luigi of Mario Brothers Fame| url=http://www.houstonpress.com/arts/10-things-you-probably-didnt-know-about-luigi-of-mario-brothers-fame-6365879| newspaper=[[Houston Press]]| accessdate=January 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continued his role as Luigi in 1991 for the ''[[Super Mario World (cartoon)|Super Mario World]]'' cartoon.&lt;ref name=Voice&gt;{{cite news| last1=Plunkett| first1=Luke| title=Tony Rosato, The Cartoon Voice Of Luigi, Dead At 62| url=http://kotaku.com/tony-rosato-the-cartoon-voice-of-luigi-dead-at-62-1791101407| accessdate=January 12, 2017| work=Kotaku| date=January 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rosato had a small voice part in ''[[Resident Evil 3]]'' as [[Dario Rosso]] and [[Nemesis (Resident Evil)|Nemesis]]. In ''[[Bakugan: Gundalian Invaders]],'' he voiced Dharak.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

Rosato also provided voices for many other animated series including ''[[Pelswick]]'', ''[[George and Martha]]'', ''[[The Busy World of Richard Scarry]]'', ''[[The Adventures of Sam and Max: Freelance Police]]'', ''[[Mythic Warriors: Guardians of the Legend]]'', ''[[Monster by Mistake]]'', ''[[The Ripping Friends]]'', ''[[Bakugan: Mechtanium Surge]]'', ''[[Da Boom Crew]]'', ''[[Get Ed]]'' and ''[[Odd Job Jack]]''.

==Personal life and death==
Rosato married his wife Leah Murray on December 31, 2003; together they have a daughter.  After seven years together, Rosato and Murray's marriage ended in a divorce in 2010.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; Rosato died of a [[Heart Attack|heart attack]] on January 10, 2017, at the age of 62.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=Beeston, Laura| date=January 11, 2017| title=Tony Rosato, veteran of SCTV and Saturday Night Live, dead at 62| url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/2017/01/11/tony-rosato-veteran-of-sctv-and-saturday-night-live-dead-at-62.html| newspaper=Toronto Star| accessdate=January 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Saturday Night Live'' paid tribute to Rosato at the end of its January 14th, 2017 episode. 

A re-animated version of the ''Super Mario World'' episode "Mama Luigi", commissioned and directed by animation artist Andrew Dickman within a year with over 227 animators and artists participating, was dedicated to Rosato alongside [[Harvey Atkin]] (King Koopa) who died on July 17. The video was finally released on August 29, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Super Mario World Reanimated Collab| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liqrfUYsOtA| date=August 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal troubles==
On May 5, 2005, Rosato was [[arrested]] and [[Indictment|charged]] with criminal harassment of his wife Leah, who asserted that his [[mental illness|deteriorating mental health]] had caused her to fear for her safety and that of the couple's infant daughter.&lt;ref name=jokester&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.thestar.com/news/2007/05/13/from_jokester_to_jailbird.html| title=From jokester to jailbird| last=Freed| first=Dale Anne| date=May 13, 2007| newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]| access-date=January 11, 2017|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The charge was laid after Rosato complained repeatedly to [[Toronto]] and [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]] police that his wife, who had recently left him, and daughter had been abducted and replaced by impostors, a belief characteristic of [[Capgras delusion]], a [[delusional misidentification syndrome]] with which the [[Crown attorney|Crown]]'s expert [[psychiatrist]] had diagnosed Rosato, according to Rosato's eighth lawyer, Daniel Brodsky. It was alleged that the harassment occurred from December 28, 2003 and escalated until April 21, 2005. In spite of the diagnosis, Rosato, who denied mental illness and refused to [[Insanity defense|plead insanity]], was held for over two years without [[bail]] at a maximum-security detention centre. Brodsky, who called his client's two-year detention awaiting trial "shocking," asserted that Rosato "spent more time in custody on a harassment charge" than anyone ever convicted of the offence in Canada, estimating that "on average, someone convicted of criminal harassment spends one day in jail and two years on probation." The trial finally commenced on August 7, 2007, in Kingston and it ended on September 5. In the end, the prosecution downgraded the charge to a [[summary offence]] from an [[indictable offence]]. Rosato was spared a criminal conviction and handed a conditional discharge, including a psychiatric hospital residence order, issued for a maximum of three years, of which he ended up serving 19 months. Rosato was released from the hospital in March 2009 but remained on probation until September 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/television/article/734276--finally-freed-ex-snl-sctv-star-returns-from-hell| newspaper=Toronto Star| title=A legend returns from his long season in hell| date=December 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
