'''Richard Travis Hall''' (born 10 June 1954) is an American comedian, writer, and musician, first coming to prominence as a [[Sketch comedy|sketch comedian]] in the 1980s. He wrote and performed for a range of [[Television in the United States|American networks]], in series such as ''[[Fridays (TV series)|Fridays]]'', ''[[Not Necessarily the News]]'' (popularising the "[[sniglet]]" neologism), and ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. 

After winning a [[Edinburgh Comedy Awards|Perrier Comedy Award]] in 2000, using the [[Character (arts)|character]] of [[Tennessee]]an [[country music]]ian '''Otis Lee Crenshaw''', Hall became popular in the [[United Kingdom]], regularly appearing on ''[[QI]]'' and similar [[panel show]]s. He has created and starred in several series for the [[BBC]], including [[Television comedy|comedies]] with [[Mike Wilmot]], and [[Documentary film|documentaries]] often concerning [[cinema of the United States]]. Hall has also maintained a successful [[stand-up comedy]] career, as both Crenshaw and himself.

==Early life==
Hall was born in [[Alexandria, Virginia]] and grew up in [[Mecklenburg County, North Carolina]]. He is part [[Cherokee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=|title=QI – Season 2 – Episode 12|work=[[QI]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early in his career, he performed as a street comedian with a suitcase and stand, traveling the college circuit, and performing impromptu skits for gathering crowds. He attended college at [[Western Carolina University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://magazine.wcu.edu/2013/08/the-bare-facts/|title=The Bare Facts|first=Randall|last=Holcolmbe|work=Western Carolina University|accessdate=January 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===United States===
[[File:richhall1a.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Rich Hall at the Tower Theatre 1986|Hall performing at the Tower Theatre in Upper Darby, Pennsylvania in 1986]]
Hall's first professional work was as a writer and performer on the original [[David Letterman Show]] (1980), and the [[sketch comedy]] TV series ''[[Fridays (TV series)|Fridays]]'' from 1980 until 1982. After the end of ''Fridays'', Hall co-wrote and starred in the satirical comedy series ''[[Not Necessarily the News]]'' from 1983 until 1990 where he coined the term "[[sniglet]]" to describe newly created words and collected and published several volumes of books of them. 
He was also a regular on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' for the show's tenth season (1984–1985), becoming the only ''Fridays'' cast member to be an ''SNL'' cast member ([[Larry David]], while also a ''Fridays'' cast member who went on to work for ''SNL'', was hired as a writer and only appeared onscreen as an extra).

In 1986, Hall had his own [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] channel special, ''Vanishing America'', which was turned into a book with the same title. He hosted a talk show during [[The Comedy Channel]]'s 1990–91 season, titled ''Rich Hall's Onion World''.

In the United States, he has appeared several times on American talk shows such as ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' and ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]''. Hall was previously a writer and on-air contributor on ''[[The David Letterman Show]]'', Letterman's morning show that aired on NBC in 1980.

Hall made a special guest appearance as himself in the [[Cartoon Network]] talk show ''[[Space Ghost Coast to Coast]]''.

In 2011, Hall voiced an Idaho man in [[Sony Pictures Animation]]'s ''[[Arthur Christmas]]''.

===United Kingdom===
Outside his homeland, Hall has also achieved popularity in the United Kingdom, where he has lived on-and-off for 23 {{When|date=June 2015}} years. He spends part of his time during the off-seasons writing plays in the United States, where he has a small ranch just outside [[Livingston, Montana]].  The rest of the time is spent in London, where he owns a flat.

Hall is a guest on popular [[BBC]] panel quiz shows, most notably as a regular guest on ''[[QI]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0356025/filmoseries#tt0380136|title=Filmography by TV series for Rich Hall (I): 'QI' (16 episodes)|work=IMDb|accessdate=2007-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is known as the game's most frequently victorious guest panellist with ten victories (only permanent panellist [[Alan Davies]] has won more shows), and also with appearances in ''[[8 Out of 10 Cats]]'', ''[[Have I Got News for You]]'' and  ''[[Never Mind the Buzzcocks]]''.&lt;ref name="buzzcocks-ep"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Rich Hall, Amy Winehouse, Mike Peters, Fearne Cotton|series=Never Mind the Buzzcocks|serieslink=Never Mind the Buzzcocks|network=BBC|airdate=2004-03-08|season=14|number=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tvcom-buzzcocks"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/never-mind-the-buzzcocks/rich-hall-amy-winehouse-mike-peters-fearne-cotton/episode/315782/summary.html|title=Rich Hall, Amy Winehouse, Mike Peters, Fearne Cotton|work=[[TV.com]]|accessdate=2007-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also appeared on the British stand-up comedy series [[Jack Dee]]'s ''[[Live at the Apollo (TV series)|Live at the Apollo]]''. His appearances achieved some cult status due to his line of jokes on ''Live at the Apollo'' about [[Tom Cruise]], and the perceivable similarities between many of his roles. In 2006, Hall also wrote and acted in the play ''Levelland'' at the [[Edinburgh Festival]].

Hall has had four [[BBC]] TV series of his own: ''Rich Hall's Badly Funded Think Tank'', ''[[Rich Hall's Fishing Show]]'' in 2003, ''[[Rich Hall's Cattle Drive]]'' in 2006, as well as a one-off programme about the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 American Presidential Elections]], ''Rich Hall's Election Special''. He also appeared on the [[BBC Two]] programme ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]'', where he successfully managed to make a song about a [[Rover 25]] car, much to the enjoyment of host [[Jeremy Clarkson]] and the audience. After the [[September 11 attacks]], Hall was entrusted with the task of responding to the tragedy on the first subsequent edition of ''[[Have I Got News for You]]''.

Hall has written and presented six 90-minute documentaries about [[film genres]], broadcast on [[BBC Four]].

==Otis Lee Crenshaw==
[[File:Rich Hall at York Theatre Royal 2014.jpg|right|thumb|Hall performing at [[York Theatre Royal]], in 2014]]
In 2000, he won the [[Perrier Comedy Award]] at the [[Edinburgh Fringe]], under the guise of his own grizzled uncle, '''Otis Lee Crenshaw''', the much-convicted country music singer. 


He has released several albums, including ''How Do We Do It? Volume!'' in 2003, and a concert video, [[kayfabe|as this character]]. The first album, ''London Not Tennessee'', in 2001, was recorded on the first comedy tour, and included two duets on stage with US singer [[Catherine Porter]]. In 2004, he published a book of the man's memoirs, entitled ''Otis Lee Crenshaw: I Blame Society'', and in 2007 he finished a screenplay for a film based on the book, written for the director [[Mel Smith]].&lt;ref name="visitor"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thevisitor.co.uk/entertainment/Acclaimed-standup-comedian-Rich-Hall.2085832.jp|title=Acclaimed Stand-up Comedian Rich Hall Makes Light of Life|date=28 February 2007|accessdate=2008-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
