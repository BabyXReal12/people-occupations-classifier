[[File:John Byner, Rue McClanahan and Beatrice Arthur in Maude, Season 5, Episode 14 (1977).jpg|thumb|275px|John Byner, [[Rue McClanahan]], [[Bea Arthur]] and [[Hermione Baddeley]] on ''[[Maude (TV series)|Maude]]'' (1977)]]

'''John Byner''' (born '''John Biener'''; June 28, 1938) is an American [[actor]], [[comedian]], and [[impressionist (entertainment)|impressionist]] who has had a lengthy television and movie career. His voice work includes the cartoon series ''[[The Ant and the Aardvark]]'', in which the title characters are voiced by Byner's impressions of [[Dean Martin]] and [[Jackie Mason]], respectively.

==Career==
On ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', where he made his first early TV appearances, he mimicked [[Ed Sullivan]] among many others. Other impressions included [[John Wayne]] and he sings as [[Dean Martin]] and [[Johnny Mathis]]. His ability to mimic "Toastmaster General" [[George Jessel (actor)|George Jessel]] came in handy during his appearances on panel programs such as celebrity "roasts" and other tributes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.povonline.com/cols/COL124.htm A Party for Wences] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060909074951/http://www.povonline.com/cols/COL124.htm|date=2006-09-09 }}, povonline.com; accessed June 28, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

On a 1967 episode of ''[[Get Smart]]'', he played a [[Get Smart#KAOS|KAOS]] agent who made a phone call to the Chief of [[Get Smart#CONTROL|CONTROL]] (played by [[Edward Platt]]), performed a perfect impression of President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], and told the Chief he was fired and replaced with agent [[Get Smart#Maxwell Smart|Maxwell Smart]] ([[Don Adams]]).

In 1970-71, he hosted 22 episodes of ''Something Else'', a syndicated half-hour musical variety series. He then hosted his own show in 1972 called the ''John Byner Comedy Hour'', where the character [[Super Dave Osborne|Super Dave]] was first introduced. That same year, he had a cameo appearance in ''[[What's Up, Doc? (1972 film)|What's Up, Doc?]]'' In the mid-1970s, he guest starred in two episodes of ''[[The Odd Couple (1970 TV series)|The Odd Couple]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0664295  "The New Car" (1973)] 
imdb.com; retrieved November 3, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Byner played a comedian/impersonator aboard a cruise ship in season 6 of ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]''. His character, Duffy Malone, did impersonations of [[John Wayne]] and then got hit on the back of his head as a diversionary tactic by the bad guy.&lt;ref&gt;(Season 6, Disc 6 Hawaii Five-O complete series)&lt;/ref&gt; He had a recurring role in the situation comedy ''[[The Practice (1976 TV series)|The Practice]]'' during its first season in 1976.

In the late 1970s, he had a featured role as Detective Donahue on the TV series ''[[Soap (TV series)|Soap]]''. He was cast in ''[[Happy Days]]'' as Mork from Ork but found the premise ridiculous, so he declined the role days before filming began. [[Robin Williams]] was called in at the last minute, and that substitution proved to be a career-making part for the comedian who deeply impressed everyone with his talent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Happy Days' Cast Reveals How Robin Williams Got Cast as a "Martian" in Show's "Worst Script" |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/happy-days-cast-reveals-how-750779 |accessdate=10 August 2018 |publisher=The Hollywood Reporter |date=20 Novemenber 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, Byner appeared several times on ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]'', where in one [[Sketch comedy|comedy sketch]] he wore a [[Donald Duck]] costume and mimicked the cartoon character's distinctive voice. He appeared several times on talk shows hosted by [[David Letterman]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://johnbyner.com/jb-on-letterman  "Entertainer Actor Comedian: John Byner"], JohnByner.com; retrieved November 3, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, he hosted ''[[Bizarre (TV series)|Bizarre]]'', which re-introduced many people to hapless daredevil [[Super Dave Osborne]] played by [[Bob Einstein]]. In 1983 he had a role as "Doc," who was [[Burt Reynolds]]' longtime childhood friend in the movie ''[[Stroker Ace]]''. In 1985 the [[Walt Disney Company]]'s animated feature ''[[The Black Cauldron (film)|The Black Cauldron]]'' was released, featuring Byner voicing the characters Gurgi and Doli. He was a regular celebrity guest on ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'' during the [[John Davidson (entertainer)|John Davidson]] years and later hosted the 1988-89 syndicated game show ''[[Relatively Speaking (game show)|Relatively Speaking]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|0125956}}; retrieved November 3, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; He appeared in an episode of ''[[Friday the 13th: The Series]]'' as a washed-up ventriloquist.

On May 26, 2017, it was reported that Byner had been cast in a supporting role in the [[Amazon Video]] horror anthology series ''[[Lore (TV series)|Lore]]'', which is based on the podcast of the same name. Byner portrays Patrick Boland, the father of [[Bridget Cleary]] (played by [[Holland Roden]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Katie McNeice|url=http://theirishfilmtelevisionnetwork.com/2017/05|title='Ray Donovan' Actor Cathal Pendred to take leading role in 'Lore' Adaption for Amazon|date=May 26, 2017|work=The Irish Film Television Network|accessdate=September 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Lore'' premiered on October 13, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Eric McAdams|url=http://pastemagazine.com/2017/08|title=Watch the Trailer for Lore, Amazon's Creepy New Show|date=August 29, 2017|work=Paste Magazine|accessdate=September 5, 2017}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Byner was born '''John Biener''' in [[New York City]], the son of Christina, a mental hospital attendant, and Michael Biener, a truck mechanic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmreference.com/film/4/John-Byner.html John Byner profile], filmreference.com; accessed June 28, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AXS"&gt;Wallace, Jeff (2015).
