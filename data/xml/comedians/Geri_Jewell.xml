==Personal life==
[[File:Keynote speaker Geri Jewell (6235421221).jpg|thumb|right|Keynote speaker Geri Jewell takes questions from the audience.]]
Her autobiography ''I'm Walking as Straight as I Can'' was published in 2011 by [[ECW Press]]. The title refers to the facts that she has [[cerebral palsy]] and is a lesbian.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tv.broadwayworld.com/article/ActressComedienne_Geri_Jewell_Releases_Memoir_Im_Walking_As_Straight_As_I_Can_20110119 Actress/Comedienne Geri Jewell Releases Memoir 'I'm Walking As Straight As I Can']&lt;/ref&gt;

Jewell's original autobiography, ''Geri'', published in 1984, talked about her personal and professional life.

{{cquote|It did help children get comfortable dealing with a person who has a disability, and taught them the value of a good sense of humor, so I’m not going to knock the whole book. But it was such lighthearted fluff given that I was struggling so much at the time. Like I said, I had a manager who was a crook. People in my life were manipulating me and taking advantage of me. Then ''The Facts of Life'' did not renew my contract. Years later, they offered me one episode during the fifth season, and my new manager, Richard Lippin, who was trying to fix all the previous manager’s mistakes, turned it down. He felt that after everything that I’d done for ''Facts'', it was a slap in the face that they would only offer me one show. If I had had it my way, I would have accepted it anyway. But I don’t blame him, because he was right. The problem was that he thought I was indispensable, and they didn’t. He figured that they would come back with something better. And—oops!—they never did. He told me not to worry about it, that I was going to find other work because I was very talented, and I was the first person with a disability to break ground in a series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abilitymagazine.com/Geri-Jewell.html |title=Interview with Geri Jewell |publisher=ABILITY Magazine |date=April–May 2012|accessdate=2012-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
