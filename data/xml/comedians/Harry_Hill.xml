'''Harry Hill''' (born '''Matthew Keith Hall'''; 1 October 1964) is an English comedian, author and [[television presenter]].  He has narrated ''[[You've Been Framed]]'' since 2004, and hosted ''[[Harry Hill's TV Burp]]'' for eleven years, from 2001 to 2012. A former [[physician]], Hill began his career in comedy when he began hosting his radio show ''[[Harry Hill's Fruit Corner]]'', but has worked on a number of projects, including his film ''[[The Harry Hill Movie]]'', which was released in 2013.

==Early life, education and medical career==
Hill was born as Matthew Keith Hall in [[Woking]], Surrey on 1 October 1964&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.woking.gov.uk/woking/people/halloffame |title=Woking Borough Council, Hall of Fame |accessdate=20 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and grew up in [[Staplehurst]], Kent, where he attended the local primary school.&lt;ref name=Staplehurst&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.staplehurstprimary.ik.org/gallery/1522665701.ikml |title=TV Star Comedian Harry Hill returns to Staplehurst School!! |publisher=Staplehurst Primary School |accessdate=19 November 2010}}{{dead link|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/jul/17/harry-hill-food-and-drink |title=Harry Hill: 'There's no such thing as healthy eating' |publisher=theguardian.com |accessdate=15 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of 14, Hill moved with his family to [[Hong Kong]] for two years and attended [[Island School]].&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt;&lt;ref name=Find/&gt; there. He was later educated at [[Angley School]] and then [[Cranbrook School, Kent|Cranbrook School]] in Kent and [[St George's Hospital Medical School]] before training in [[neurosurgery]] at the [[University of London]].

Hill worked as a [[Senior house officer|house officer]] at [[Doncaster Royal Infirmary]], before quitting the medical profession because he "didn't feel in control of what was happening"; he is still registered on the [[General Medical Council]]'s list of [[Registered Medical Practitioner]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sundaymercury.net/entertainment-news/tv-news/2010/02/28/7-things-you-never-knew-about-harry-hill-66331-25928790/ |title=7 things you never knew about Harry Hill |publisher=Sunday Mercury |date=28 February 2010 |accessdate=2011-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tv.bt.com/tv/tv-news/doctor-who-harry-hills-secret-past-and-5-more-career-change-comics-11363953633879|title=Doctor Who?

==Career==

===''Harry Hill's Fruit Corner'' (1993–1997)===
{{Main article|Harry Hill's Fruit Corner}}
Hill achieved his breakthrough in 1992, when he won the Perrier Award for Best Newcomer at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. Shortly after, a radio show starring Hill was commissioned by [[BBC Radio 4]] entitled ''[[Harry Hill's Fruit Corner]]''. Hill hosted the show as himself, and each week, he was joined by various guest performers, as well as regular character actors including [[Al Murray]] and [[Burt Kwouk]]. The show featured a variety of other celebrity guests during its run including [[Rolf Harris]] and [[Ronnie Corbett]].

Each programme was interspersed with  Hill's stand up routines. ''Fruit Corner'' ran for four series on [[BBC Radio 4]].

===''Fruit Fancies'' (1994)===
Hill made his television breakthrough in 1994, when he starred in [[BBC Two]] black and white silent comedy series ''Harry Hill's Fruit Fancies''. In a similar format to ''Fruit Corner'', Hill would perform a series of sketches, with a number of celebrity guests making cameo appearances. The series also featured one of the characters from ''Fruit Corner'', three year old Alan Hill Jr.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9sWJwfBKVE|title=Harry Hill's Fruit Fancies – Punch|work=YouTube|accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series ran for six episodes on [[BBC Two]] between October and December 1994. For Christmas that year, a VHS containing a one hundred minute compilation of the best material from the series, as well as unseen sketches, was released by BBC Video. It has since become a rare item.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Harry-Hill-fruit-Fancies/dp/B00004CQXC/ref=sr_1_fkmr2_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1345997375&amp;sr=8-1-fkmr2|title=Harry Hill's Fruit Fancies|publisher=Amazon.co.uk|accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Harry Hill'' (1997–2000)===
{{Main article|Harry Hill (TV series)|l1=''Harry Hill''}}
From May 1997 onwards, Hill presented his own [[Channel 4]] television sketch series, ''[[Harry Hill (TV series)|Harry Hill]]'', which ran for three series between 1997 and 2000. The show was a television adaptation of ''Fruit Corner''.

Among the regular characters were Hill's big brother, Alan, played by comedian [[Al Murray]], and his adopted son, Alan Jr., played by Dr Matt Bradstock. [[Burt Kwouk]] also appeared in many episodes of the programme, as Harry's "Chicken Catcher" – and each week, he would come up with an excuse as to why he has not yet captured a chicken, followed by a performance of the song ''Hey Little Hen''. In later series, Hill and Kwouk appeared in sketches as [[Karl Lagerfeld]] and [[Gianni Versace]].

Hill's screen wife Mai Sung also made several appearances on the show, mainly around the theme of trying to steal his [[Abbey National]] bank savings book. Another character that featured on the show was Stouffer the Cat, a [[glove puppet]] cat made from blue rubber. Stouffer would normally sit in a throne, supported by a rubber arm in the style of [[Rod Hull]], and was employed to intimidate guests during Hill's standup routines. Some of Stouffer's famous catchphrases are "he got a big face" and "sorted – respect due".

At the end of each episode, an event called "The Badger Parade" was supposed to take place. The parade featured a number of [[puppet]] [[badger]]s that included [[Gareth Southgate]] badger and [[Tasmin Archer]] badger, among others – however, every week, there would be some kind of problem, resulting in the badgers being unable to perform. In place of the badger parade, Hill would usually sing a song, with a guest that he had invited onto the show. A [[tie-in]] book relating to the series was released in October 1998, entitled ''Harry Hill's Fun Book''.

The series was cancelled in April 2000, but was revived in March 2003, as ''[[The All-New Harry Hill Show]]'', this time by [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]], who broadcast it along with episodes of TV Burp. Regular features on the ITV version included the Hamilton Challenge, featuring [[Neil Hamilton (politician)|Neil]] and [[Christine Hamilton]], and a butterfly in blue jeans. The Channel 4 series was revisited in August 2012, for a humorous retrospective documentary entitled ''Whatever Happened to Harry Hill?'' {{as of|2017}}, neither the Channel 4 nor ITV series have been released on DVD.

===''Harry Hill's TV Burp'' (2001–2012)===
{{main article|Harry Hill's TV Burp}}
In October 2001, Hill moved to [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]] in a lucrative deal, in which he created an all new show, ''[[Harry Hill's TV Burp]]'', where he would take a look at the week's television, showing clips from various British television programmes, and framing them with commentary or intercutting additional footage.

The series would feature a regular stable of all new characters, including the Knitted Character, a small, knitted rabbit, Wagbo, a demon love child whose parents are reportedly [[The X Factor (UK series 7)|Wagner Carillho and Mary Byrne]] of ''[[The X Factor (UK TV series)|X Factor]]'' fame, an interpretation of [[Heather Trott]] from ''[[EastEnders]]'', played by Steve Bernham, as well as a doll of ''[[The Apprentice (UK TV series)|The Apprentice]]'' star [[Alan Sugar]], who would regularly rap before clips of ''The Apprentice'' were introduced.

The show was piloted in December 2001, before running for eleven full series between 2002 and 2012, before being cancelled to allow Hill to work on other projects. The show won a number of [[BAFTA]] awards, and spawned five ''Best of TV Burp'' DVD compilations, and a book based on the series, which was released for Christmas 2009.

===''You've Been Framed'' (2004–present)===
{{main article|You've Been Framed!}}
Since 2004, Hill has narrated the comical clips show ''[[You've Been Framed!]]'', often shortened to ''YBF!'' replacing [[Jonathan Wilkes]] on the show. Hill has narrated thirteen series to date. New episodes of ''You've Been Framed!'' are still being recorded and air on early Saturday evenings on [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]].

===''Harry Hill's Shark Infested Custard'' (2005)===
{{main article|Harry Hill's Shark Infested Custard}}
In October 2005, Hill moved into new territory with ''[[Harry Hill's Shark Infested Custard]]'', a thirteen part show broadcast in the [[CITV]] children's television slot, on [[ITV Network|ITV]]. While many of his well known characters, such as Stouffer and Garry Hill, his fictional layabout son from his first marriage, remained, it also showcased several new characters, including Speed Camera Boy, an outsider who is half boy and half [[Road safety camera|speed camera]], and Evelynne Hussey, a one-woman band who played a number of different instruments.

While the show featured a game show element, ''Help the Aged'', it was very similar in structure to ''[[Harry Hill (TV series)|Harry Hill]]''. In the show, Hill wore a pale yellow, custard coloured shirt, with a giant collar, instead of his usual white collar.

The series was never released on DVD; however, it did spawn ''Harry Hill's Whopping Great Joke Book'', a book of children's jokes, released in 2006. The book was also made available as an [[iPhone]] application.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://harryhillsjokebookapp.com/ |title=Harry Hill's Whopping Great Joke Book – The app for iPhone and iPod Touch |publisher=Harryhillsjokebookapp.com |accessdate=2011-10-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111019090316/http://harryhillsjokebookapp.com/ |archivedate=19 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A second book, ''Harry Hill's Bumper Book of Bloopers'', was released for Christmas 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Harry-Hills-Bumper-Book-Bloopers/dp/0571281745/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1346000380&amp;sr=1-1|title=Harry Hill's Bumper Book of Bloopers: Amazon.co.uk: Harry Hill: Books|publisher=Amazon.co.uk|accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Harry Hill Movie'' (2013)===
{{main article|The Harry Hill Movie}}
''[[The Harry Hill Movie]]'' premiered in the [[United Kingdom]] on 20 December 2013. The film also stars [[Matt Lucas]], [[Julie Walters]], [[Johnny Vegas]], [[Sheridan Smith]], [[Simon Bird]], [[Marc Wootton]], [[Jim Broadbent]], and band [[The Magic Numbers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/movies/news/a524447/the-harry-hill-movie-premieres-first-trailer-watch-video.html|title='The Harry Hill Movie' premieres first trailer – watch video|work=Digital Spy|accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3013528/|title=The Harry Hill Movie (2013)|author=pmedinacorreo|date=20 December 2013|work=IMDb|accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/24548250|title=The Harry Hill Movie gets 20 December UK release date|work=BBC News|accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The film sees Hill embark on a road trip to [[Blackpool]] with his Nan ([[Julie Walters]]) when he discovers that his hamster only has one week to live.

The 88 minute film was directed by [[Steve Bendelack]]. To date, it has made $3,647,870 at the box office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/movies/news/a540494/the-hobbit-holds-off-anchorman-2-at-uk-box-office-top-10-in-full.html|title=The Hobbit holds off Anchorman 2 at UK box office – top 10 in full|work=Digital Spy|accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was released on DVD on 14 April 2014.

===''Stars in Their Eyes'' (2015)===
{{main article|Stars in Their Eyes}}
Hill presented a revived version of the ITV talent show ''[[Stars in their Eyes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.itv.com/presscentre/ep1week3/harry-hills-stars-their-eyes|title=Harry Hill’s Stars In Their Eyes Episode 1|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series aired for six episodes from 10 January until 14 February 2015. The revival has proved divisive. Fans of the original format were critical of it, saying that Hill had made the show about himself rather than the contestants.

In April 2015, it was announced that the show had been axed by ITV, due to extremely poor ratings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/news/a642410/harry-hills-stars-in-their-eyes-has-it-been-axed-by-itv.html|title=Stars in Their Eyes: Has it been axed?|date=17 April 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Harry Hill's Tea Time'' (2016–present)===
''Tea Time'' saw Hill welcome guests to a spoof comedy kitchen and ask them to cook bizarre things. A new entertainment series for [[Sky 1]], the first series debuted on 16 October 2016, and was viewed by 400,000 viewers. Ratings slipped the following week, when only 180,000 watched. Guests for the first series included [[Paul Hollywood]], [[Joey Essex]], [[Gok Wan]], [[Martin Kemp]] and [[Jason Donovan]]. 

''Harry Hill's Tea Time'' was commissioned for a second series which began airing in January 2018.

===''Harry Hill's Alien Fun Capsule'' (2017–present)===
In March 2017, Hill began presenting 6x30minute episode of ''[[Harry Hill's Alien Fun Capsule]]'', which airs on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] on Thursday nights, 8.30 to 9&amp;nbsp;pm.

The [[panel show]] sees Harry welcoming two teams of two celebrity guests as they are tasked with saving planet Earth from [[alien invasion]] by sending evidence (via the "fun capsule" of the title) that Earthlings are good fun and therefore worthy of saving from destruction. Harry alludes to the premise of the show as being rather tenuous in a running joke during each show's introduction, before introducing the two teams of guests, usually a mix of comedians and television stars.

In a similar style to ''[[Harry Hill's TV Burp]]'', the show includes various clips from television and film, often attributed or related somehow to the current guests. The guests also partake in sketches and songs based on or directly spoofing the funny or bizarre items featured. There is a regular slot entitled "Local News Round Up", accompanied by its own theme tune, which involves each of the guests taking turns to read out bizarre headlines from local newspapers. Alan the Alien also appears as a green extra terrestrial's arm, emerging from a box to aid Harry in some way.

The series has received positive reviews, with many pointing out the similarities to ''TV Burp''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/harry-hills-superb-alien-fun-10006119|title=Harry Hill's superb Alien Fun Capsule is a bit like TV Burp repeating itself|first=Ian|last=Hyland|date=10 March 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2017-03-02/what-is-harry-hills-alien-fun-capsule-on-itv-is-it-any-good|title=What is Harry Hill's Alien Fun capsule on ITV?

The show moved to Saturday Evenings between 7.30&amp;nbsp;pm and 8.00&amp;nbsp;pm for a second series, aired in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.itv.com/presscentre/press-releases/itv-recommissions-harry-hills-alien-fun-capsule|title=ITV recommissions Harry Hill's Alien Fun Capsule|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.digitalspy.com/tv/news/a826235/harry-hill-alien-fun-capsule-getting-a-second-series/|title=Harry Hill's Alien Fun Capsule gets a second series|date=18 April 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Novels===
In 2002, Hill published the first in a series of novels and books he had written, entitled ''Flight From Deathrow'', based around the accounts of the unlikely antics of real-life celebrities and politicians, as seen through the eyes of the storyteller, as he drifts in and out of a coma. His second book, ''[[Tim the Tiny Horse]]'', was published in October 2006, and featured the tale of a small horse who had to wear glasses because of poor eyesight.

Hill's third book, ''The Further Adventures of the [[Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon|Queen Mum]]'', was published in October 2007, and was a comic take on the life and times of the Queen Mother. His fourth novel, ''[[Tim the Tiny Horse at Large]]'', which is a sequel to the first book, was published in October 2009. Another novel, A Complete History of Tim (the Tiny Horse), was released on 1 November 2012.

In 2010, Hill released ''Livin' the Dreem'', a fictional account of a year in his life, featuring references to pop culture. The book was reprinted in May 2011, with additional entries for events that occurred between January and April of that year. ''A Complete History of Tim (the Tiny Horse)'' was published in November 2012 which contains the first two ''Tim the Tiny Horse'' novels, with four new stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Complete-History-Tim-Tiny-Horse/dp/0571280374/ref=sr_1_20?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1346000401&amp;sr=1-20|title=A Complete History of Tim (the Tiny Horse)|publisher=Amazon.co.uk|accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other projects===
Hill's instantly recognisable voice has led to work in many voice over roles on television commercials. Advertisements that Hill has provided a voice over for include the holiday adverts for [[Boots Group|Boots]] in 2004, the "Bring on the Branston!" adverts for the [[Branston Pickle]] brand during 2006 to 2007, adverts for the [[Green Flag]] car breakdown service, and adverts for the new yogurt, ''Danio by [[Danone]]''.

In February 2001, and again in April, Hill appeared on ''[[Lily Savage's Blankety Blank]]''.&lt;ref name="blanketyblank2"&gt;{{cite episode|series=Lily Savage's Blankety Blank|network=[[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]|airdate=25 February 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="blanketyblank"&gt;{{cite episode|series=Lily Savage's Blankety Blank|network=[[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]|airdate=29 April 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hill has also appeared as a guest on the [[BBC Radio 4]] series ''[[I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue]]'', in the ''[[ChuckleVision]]'' episode "Mind Your Manors", the first episode of the twentieth series, and as Joon Boolay in the [[Sky Atlantic]] sitcom ''[[This is Jinsy]]''.&lt;ref name="yahoo_july2011"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uk.tv.yahoo.com/news-extra/article/168245/daily-tv-round-upharry-goes-drag-in-new-comedy.html |title=Daily TV round-up – Harry goes drag in new comedy |work=Yahoo! TV |year=2011 |accessdate=28 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2006, Hill presented his own episode of long running ITV series, ''An Audience With...'', in which he revived several characters from ''Harry Hill''. On 4 October 2004, he also appeared in an episode of ''[[Room 101 (TV series)|Room 101]]''.

In November 2010, Hill released his debut comic album, 'Funny Times'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hard Times For Harry |url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/bizarre/3152776/Harry-Hills-fantasic-new-album.html|publisher=The Sun |date=25 September 2010 |accessdate=27 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album was preceded by the singles 'I Wanna Baby', 'SuBo', and 'Ken!', which features [[William Roache]], as his ''[[Coronation Street]]'' character, [[Ken Barlow]], is the feature of the song.

Since October 2010, Hill has had his own comic strip in ''[[The Dandy]]'', entitled ''[[Harry Hill's Real Life Adventures in TV Land]]'', drawn by [[Nigel Parkinson]]. Hill was directly involved in its creation and is co-credited with Parkinson. Between October and December 2010, Hill starred in a weekly online comedy series on the [[ChannelFlip]] website, entitled ''Harry Hill's Little Internet Show''.
