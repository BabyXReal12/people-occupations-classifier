'''Shirley Ann Hemphill''' (July 1, 1947 &amp;ndash; December 10, 1999) was an American stand-up comedian and [[actress]].

A native of [[Asheville, North Carolina]], Hemphill moved to [[Los Angeles]] in the 1970s to pursue a career as a stand-up comedian. After working the Los Angeles comedy club circuit, her routine eventually attracted attention leading to her being cast in guest starring roles on television. In 1976, she landed the role of waitress Shirley Wilson on the sitcom ''[[What's Happening!!]]''  The series was a modest hit for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], but production and cast problems caused ABC to cancel the series in 1979. The following year, Hemphill was cast in her own sitcom, ''[[One in a Million (US TV series)|One in a Million]]''. The series failed to attract an audience and was canceled in June 1980.

In 1985, Hemphill reprised her role as Shirley Wilson in the [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] revival of ''What's Happening!!'' titled ''[[What's Happening Now!!]]''  Like its predecessor, ''What's Happening Now!!'' aired for three seasons. After the show's cancellation, Hemphill returned to stand-up comedy and also made occasional appearances in films and television.

In December 1999, Hemphill died of [[renal failure]] at her [[West Covina, California]], home at the age of 52.

==Early life==
Hemphill was born in [[Asheville, North Carolina]], to Richard and Mozella Hemphill. She had a brother, William. Hemphill attended Hill Street School and Stephens-Lee High School, and later won an athletics scholarship to [[Morristown College]] where she majored in [[physical education]]. Hemphill returned to Asheville two years later where she got a job in a factory manufacturing nylons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=May 1980|title=Shirley Hemphill: A Star Is Born|journal=Ebony|publisher=Johnson Publishing Company|volume=35|issue=7|page=93|issn=0012-9011|url=https://books.google.com/?id=NDbcot0HasEC&amp;pg=PA93&amp;dq=shirley+hemphill+mozella#v=onepage&amp;q=shirley%20hemphill%20mozella&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An aspiring stand-up comedian, Hemphill sent a cassette tape of one of her comedy routines to [[Flip Wilson]]. Wilson was impressed by her routine and in turn, sent her a cassette recorder and a dozen roses. Wilson also invited Hemphill to visit the set of ''[[The Flip Wilson Show]]''. After the visit, Hemphill returned to her job in Asheville but decided to pursue a career in comedy instead. She quit her job and traveled to Los Angeles by bus. Hemphill got a job waitressing during the day and performed at [[The Comedy Store]] at night.&lt;ref name="merced"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=K6BcAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=WVgNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4793,3189114&amp;dq=shirley+hemphill&amp;hl=en|title=Shirley Hemphill's career has taken off in a taxicab|last=Buck|first=Jerry|date=February 6, 1980|work=Merced Sun-Star|page=6|accessdate=January 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ebony"&gt;{{cite journal|title=What's Happening!!: ABC's popular teen-age sitcom succeeds in spite of itself|journal=Ebony|publisher=Johnson Publishing Company|volume=33|issue=8|page=82|issn=0012-9011|url=https://books.google.com/?id=CM4DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA74&amp;dq=mabel+king+what%27s+happening#v=onepage&amp;q=mabel%20king%20what%27s%20happening&amp;f=false|date=June 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
By 1976, Hemphill's stand-up routine started to get noticed and caught the attention of casting agent Joan Murray.&lt;ref name="ebony" /&gt; Murray cast Hemphill in guest roles on ''[[Good Times]]'' which led to another guest starring role on ''[[All's Fair]]''. After seeing her performance on ''Good Times'', [[Norman Lear]] offered Hemphill her own [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series but she turned it down. Instead, she auditioned and won the role of waitress Shirley Wilson on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] sitcom ''[[What's Happening!!]]''.&lt;ref name="merced" /&gt; Loosely based on [[Eric Monte]]'s film ''[[Cooley High]]'', the series follows the adventures of three teenaged boys: Raj ([[Ernest Lee Thomas|Ernest Thomas]]), Rerun ([[Fred Berry]]), and Dwayne ([[Haywood Nelson]]). Hemphill's character worked at Rob's Place, the restaurant the boys frequented. The series was a modest hit for ABC but was beset with behind the scene problems. In the series' second season, Fred Berry and Ernest Thomas staged a [[walkout]] over their dressing room conditions which they claimed were unsuitable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Messy' Dressing Room Cleaned Up, 'What's Happening' Stars Return|journal=Jet|publisher=Johnson Publishing Company|volume=53|issue=5|page=57|issn=0021-5996|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nrsDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA57&amp;dq=Messy%27+Dressing+Room+Cleaned+Up#v=onepage&amp;q=Messy%27%20Dressing%20Room%20Cleaned%20Up&amp;f=false|date=1977-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the series' third season, Fred Berry demanded more money and reportedly convinced Ernest Thomas and Haywood Nelson to join him in a strike. Producers opted to cancel the series instead of increasing the actors' salaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gsusignal.com/2.14075/the-exploitation-of-fred-rerun-berry-1.1949248#.UPTJhvKBWSo|title=The Exploitation of Fred 'Rerun' Berry|last=Huff|first=Dominique|date=April 19, 2006|publisher=gsusignal.com|accessdate=January 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the cancellation of ''What's Happening'', Hemphill auditioned for the role of the cook on ''[[Archie Bunker's Place]]'', but lost out to [[Anne Meara]]. The day after losing the role, Hemphill was offered the starring role in her own sitcom ''[[One in a Million (US TV series)|One in a Million]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=aD1PAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=jgIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6923,3827395&amp;dq=shirley+hemphill+death&amp;hl=en|title=Shirley Lost Cook's Job, But Won Whole Company|last=Winfrey|first=Lee|date=January 30, 1980|work=Toledo Blade|pages=P–4|accessdate=January 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the series, she portrayed Shirley Simmons, a taxi driver who inherited a huge corporation and fortune from one of her customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=y1pQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=v1gDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6484,1735534&amp;dq=shirley+hemphill+one+in+a+million&amp;hl=en|title=Which Would You Choose?|date=January 8, 1980|work=The Evening Independent|pages=9–B|accessdate=January 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The series debuted on ABC on January 8, 1980, but failed to attract a sufficient audience. ABC canceled the series in June 1980.&lt;ref name=mccann&gt;{{cite book|last=McCann|first=Bob |title=Encyclopedia of African American Actresses in Film and Television|year=2010|publisher=McFarland|isbn=0-786-43790-1|page=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Afterward, Hemphill would spend most of the early 1980s working in nightclubs around the country and doing the occasional guest appearance on TV shows, including ''[[The Love Boat]]'' and ''[[Trapper John, M.D.]]''.  In 1985, she was invited to co-star on the revival of ''What's Happening!!'' entitled ''[[What's Happening Now!!]]'', which aired in [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] from 1985 to 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=August 26, 1985|title='What's Happening' Show Returns In Syndication|journal=Jet|publisher=Johnson Publishing Company|volume=68|issue=24|page=64|issn=0021-5996|url=https://books.google.com/?id=prQDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA64&amp;dq=what%27s+happening+abc+cancelled#v=onepage&amp;q=what%27s%20happening%20abc%20cancelled&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; After ''What's Happening Now!!'' ended its three-year run, she again worked the nightclub scene and doing the occasional acting gig on a number of '90s comedy sitcoms, including ''[[Martin (TV series)|Martin]]'' and ''[[The Wayans Bros.]]''.&lt;ref name=mccann /&gt; In 1993, she appeared in her first movie, ''[[CB4]]'', starring [[Chris Rock]]. Two years later she co-starred in her second movie, ''Shoot the Moon'', starring Whitney Anderson.

Throughout her career, Hemphill performed her stand-up routine on a number of popular TV shows including ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'', [[A&amp;E Network|A&amp;E]]'s ''[[An Evening at the Improv]]'', [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]]'s ''Black Comedy Showcase'' and ''Black Comedy Tonight''. She was also a regular at [[The Laugh Factory]] comedy club in [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=January 10, 2000|title=Actress Shirley Hemphill, 52, Found Dead In Her Los Angeles Home|journal=Jet|publisher=Johnson Publishing Company|volume=97|issue=5|page=17|issn=0021-5996|url=https://books.google.com/?id=SDsDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA17&amp;dq=shirley+hemphill#v=onepage&amp;q=shirley%20hemphill&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year before her death, Hemphill appeared in an episode of ''[[The Jenny Jones Show]]'' in a ''What's Happening!!'' reunion show; actors [[Ernest Lee Thomas|Ernest Thomas]] and [[Haywood Nelson]] also appeared.

==Death==
On December 10, 1999, Hemphill was found dead at her home in [[West Covina, California]]. Her body was discovered by a gardener who looked through a window and saw her lying on her bedroom floor. An autopsy determined that Hemphill died of [[renal failure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=BV1IAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=qwMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2725,3782816&amp;dq=shirley+hemphill+west+covina&amp;hl=en|title=Shirley Hemphill|date=December 12, 1999|work=Toledo Blade|page=24|accessdate=January 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Christian|first=Margena A.|title=Where Is...The Cast of 'What's Happening'?|journal=Jet|publisher=Johnson Publishing Company|volume=112|issue=15|page=50|issn=0021-5996|url=https://books.google.com/?id=0ToDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA50&amp;dq=Hemphill+died+of+kidney+failure#v=onepage&amp;q=Hemphill%20died%20of%20kidney%20failure&amp;f=false|date=2007-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hemphill was cremated.
