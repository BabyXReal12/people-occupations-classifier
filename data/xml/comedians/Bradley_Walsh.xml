In October 2017, the BBC announced that Walsh had been cast as Graham O'Brien in the [[Doctor Who (series 11)|eleventh series]] of ''[[Doctor Who]]'' which will broadcast in late 2018.

==Early life==
Walsh was born in [[Watford]], [[Hertfordshire]], and grew up nearby in [[Leavesden, Hertfordshire|Leavesden]]. He attended what is now [[Francis Combe Academy]], a [[comprehensive school]] in [[Garston, Hertfordshire]].&lt;ref name=SchoolReunion /&gt; At school, Walsh showed a particular interest in [[Sports studies|sports]] and [[Media studies|media]], and passed [[O-levels]] in both subjects. He was also a prominent member of the school's football squad, scoring 64 goals during his time there.&lt;ref name="Francis Combe prospectus" /&gt;

==Football career==
In late 1978, at the age of eighteen, Walsh became a professional football player for [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]] and although he failed to make the first team, he was regularly a member of the reserves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://world.brentfordfc.co.uk/page/LatestNews/0,,10421~883335,00.html |title=Brentford {{!}} News {{!}} Latest News {{!}} Latest News {{!}} EX BEES ROVER RETURNS |date=16 August 2006 |website=world.brentfordfc.co.uk |accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Separate ankle fracture injuries finished his career in the game in the early-1980s after a promising loan spell with non-league [[Dunstable Town F.C.|Dunstable Town]], for whom he scored 15 goals in 25 league appearances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tv.bt.com/tv/tv-news/bradley-walsh-the-chase-doctor-who-11364053506847|title=Bradley Walsh: 8 things you never knew about the Doctor Who and Chase star|date=23 October 2017|accessdate=2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Walsh's time at Brentford also saw him play for [[Barnet F.C.|Barnet]] on loan, making five [[Southern Football League]] appearances in the 1978–79 season. He also played for [[Tring Town F.C.|Tring Town]], [[Boreham Wood F.C.|Boreham Wood]] and [[Chalfont St Peter A.F.C.|Chalfont St Peter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= |first= |year=1995 |title=Griffin Gazette: Brentford's Official Matchday Magazine versus Chesterfield 30/09/95 |url= |location= |page=13|isbn= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Walsh often participates in [[Soccer Aid]], a charity football match where England takes on The Rest of the World with teams made up of celebrities and football legends,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://socceraid.unicef.org.uk/players.html|title=Soccer Aid Teams |publisher= Unicef UK|accessdate=18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; he helped England win the [[Soccer Aid|2006]] edition as a player and the [[Soccer Aid|2012]] and [[Soccer Aid|2016]] editions as a coach.

==Television==
Following his football career, Walsh had a variety of jobs including working as a bluecoat at [[Pontins]]&lt;ref name=Independent_Interview_2006 /&gt; in [[Morecambe]] for three months.&lt;ref name=Telegraph_Interview_2012 /&gt; He first came to prominence on television in 1994 after he won a role as one of the presenting team on the ''[[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery]]'' which was regularly broadcast on Saturday and Wednesday evenings on [[BBC One]].

After Walsh became a public favourite, he was quickly snapped up by rival television channel [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]], who offered him the role as presenter on one of the network's new game shows, ''Midas Touch''. In 1997, Walsh was asked to front the British adaptation of the popular US game show ''[[Wheel of Fortune (UK game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'' following the decision of long-time presenter [[Nicky Campbell]] to leave the show after more than eight years.

Walsh's tenure on ''Wheel of Fortune'' lasted just one year, when he decided to turn his hand to acting. He also appeared on ''[[Lily Savage's Blankety Blank]]''.&lt;ref name=blanketyblank2&gt;{{cite episode|series=Lily Savage's Blankety Blank|network=[[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]|airdate=11 March 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acting===
Walsh's first acting job was a minor role in the [[Channel 4]] series, ''[[Lock, Stock...]]''. Channel 4 later approached him  for a role in their 2001 TV film ''[[Mike Bassett: England Manager]]''.

Walsh returned to ITV in 2002, after landing a regular role in the short lived British soap opera ''[[Night and Day (soap opera)|Night and Day]]''. He featured in a total of 52 episodes. In 2003, Walsh played a minor role in an episode of ''[[The Bill (TV series)|The Bill]]'' spin-off ''[[M.I.T.: Murder Investigation Team]]''. In October 2007, he appeared in  TV drama ''[[Torn (TV series)|Torn]]''.

In 2008, Walsh appeared in two episodes of ''[[Doctor Who]]'' spin-off ''[[The Sarah Jane Adventures]]'', in the second story of series two, ''[[The Day of the Clown]]'', as a sinister entity that fed off other people's fear. In his role, he played three parts of the same ego – a sinister American-sounding clown called Odd Bob, a mysterious European-sounding ringmaster called Elijah Spellman, and the infamous [[Pied Piper of Hamelin]].

In January 2009, Walsh and his son Barney featured in a special edition of  the [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]]  TV series, ''Dangerous Adventures for Boys'', based on the best-selling book  by Conn and Hal Iggulden, ''[[The Dangerous Book for Boys]]''. Walsh and his son took part in hill-climbing before learning how to pilot a [[biplane]].

In January 2009, Walsh began appearing in [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] crime drama ''[[Law &amp; Order: UK]]''. Walsh  plays the character of DS Ronnie Brooks, a recovering alcoholic who has been in the police force for more than twenty years. From 2009 until 2014, Walsh starred in a total of 53 episodes. After the eighth series, Walsh decided to take a break from the programme and ITV decided to rest the show, but it has not been cancelled and is simply on a hiatus. Walsh said he would "like the opportunity to pursue other drama projects which ITV are developing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/news/a575439/itv-to-rest-law--order-uk-as-bradley-walsh-quits.html#~oGTWNVNcUxoHzK|title=ITV to rest Law &amp; Order: UK as Bradley Walsh quits|work=Digital Spy|accessdate=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Walsh was approached for a role in soap opera ''[[Coronation Street]]''. On 31 May 2004, Walsh made his first appearance in Weatherfield as factory boss [[Danny Baldwin]]. It was originally envisaged that Walsh's character would be called Vic, however, Walsh asked for the character's name to be changed to Danny after his late father. He also commented that "people had previously called me Young Danny, so I thought it would not be so bad when people called me by my character name."

In December 2006, Walsh was written out of the serial at his own request.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a496252/bradley-walsh-i-cant-rule-out-coronation-street-return.html|title=Bradley Walsh: 'I can't rule out Coronation Street return'|work=Digital Spy|accessdate=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his time in ''Coronation Street'', Walsh also appeared as [[Burglar Bill]] in the one-off play ''[[Children's Party at the Palace|The Queen's Handbag]]''.
