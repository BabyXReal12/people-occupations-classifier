'''Christopher J Morris''' (born 15 June 1962) is an English comedian, writer, director, actor, voice actor, and producer. He is known for his [[black humour]], [[surrealism]], and controversial subject matter, and has been hailed for his "uncompromising, moralistic drive" by the [[British Film Institute]].&lt;ref name="screenonline"&gt;{{cite web|title=Morris, Christopher (1963– )|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/1392135/index.html|publisher=British Film Institute|accessdate=29 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1990s, Morris teamed up with his radio producer, [[Armando Iannucci]], to create ''[[On the Hour]]'', a satire of news programmes. This was expanded into a television spin off, ''[[The Day Today]]'', which launched the career of [[Steve Coogan]], and has since been hailed as one of the most important satirical shows of the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Elizabeth Day |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2010/apr/04/disgusting-bliss-chris-morris-biography |title=Disgusting Bliss by Lucian Randall &amp;#124; Book review |work= The Observer |publisher=Guardian |date= 4 April 2010|accessdate=18 September 2013 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morris further developed the satirical news format with ''[[Brass Eye]]'', which lampooned celebrities whilst focusing on themes such as crime and drugs. For many, the [[apotheosis]] of Morris' career was a ''Brass Eye'' special, which dealt with the [[moral panic]] surrounding [[paedophilia]]. It quickly became one of the most complained about programmes in British television history, leading the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' to describe him as "the most loathed man on TV".&lt;ref&gt;''The Guardian'' (London) 21 February 2003 Review: CHRIS MORRIS: THE MOVIE: The last time he was in the news, it was for the 'paedophile special' of his TV series Brass Eye. Now he's made a film – just 15 minutes long – which is tipped to win a Bafta on Sunday. In a rare interview, Britain's greatest contemporary satirist talks to Xan Brooks about making the film, celebrities and why he won't be tackling the war on terror  BYLINE: Xan Brooks&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Morris' [[postmodern]] sketch and [[ambient music]] radio show ''[[Blue Jam]]'' helped him to gain a [[cult following]]. He went on to win a [[BAFTA]] for Best Short Film after expanding a ''Blue Jam'' sketch into ''[[My Wrongs 8245–8249 &amp; 117]]'', which starred [[Paddy Considine]]. ''Blue Jam'' was adapted into the TV series ''[[Jam (TV series)|Jam]]''. This was followed by ''[[Nathan Barley]]'', a sitcom written in collaboration with a then little-known [[Charlie Brooker]] that satirised [[hipster (contemporary subculture)|hipsters]], which had low ratings but found success upon its DVD release. Morris followed this by joining the cast of the [[Graham Linehan]] sitcom ''[[The IT Crowd]]'', his first project in which he did not have writing or producing input.

In 2010, Morris directed his first feature-length film, ''[[Four Lions]]'', which satirised [[Islamic terrorism]] through a group of inept [[British Pakistani]]s. Reception of the film was largely positive, earning Morris his second BAFTA, for "Outstanding Debut". Since 2012, he has directed four episodes of Iannucci's political comedy ''[[Veep (TV series)|Veep]]'' and appeared onscreen in ''[[The Double (2013 film)|The Double]]'' and ''[[Stewart Lee's Comedy Vehicle]]''.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Morris was born in [[Colchester]], [[Essex]],&lt;ref name="findmypast"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.findmypast.co.uk/results/world-records/england-and-wales-births-1837-2006?firstname=christopher&amp;lastname=morris&amp;eventyear=1962&amp;eventyear_offset=5&amp;mothersmaidenname=parrington|title=findmypast.co.uk|publisher=search.findmypast.co.uk|accessdate=5 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; to father Paul Michael Morris, a [[general practitioner|GP]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bookreviews/7594826/Disgusting-Bliss-the-Brass-Eye-of-ChrisMorris-by-Lucian-Randall-review.html |title=Disgusting Bliss: the Brass Eye of Chris Morris by Lucian Randall: review |publisher=Telegraph |date=15 April 2010 |accessdate=18 September 2013 |location=London |first=Sameer |last=Rahim}}&lt;/ref&gt; and mother Rosemary Parrington&lt;ref name="Randall2010"&gt;{{cite book|title=Disgusting Bliss: The Brass Eye of Chris Morris|author=Randall, L.|date=2010|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster UK|isbn=9780857200907|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=idNdAAAAQBAJ|accessdate=5 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and grew up in a [[Victorian era|Victorian]] farmhouse in the village [[Buckden, Cambridgeshire|Buckden]], [[Huntingdonshire]], which he describes as "very dull".&lt;ref&gt;If It Bleeds It Leads 6 June 1994 – By Simon Price – From The Melody Maker&lt;/ref&gt;

He has two younger brothers, including theatre director [[Tom Morris (director)|Tom Morris]].&lt;ref&gt;Profile: Chris Morris, BBC Radio 4&lt;/ref&gt; From an early age he was a prankster, and also had a passion for radio. From the age of 10 he was educated at [[Stonyhurst College]], an independent [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] boarding school in [[Lancashire]].&lt;ref name="bbc_Brass_Neck"&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1460463.stm|title= Chris Morris: Brass Neck|accessdate= 23 June 2008|date= 27 July 2001|publisher=BBC News |quote= The son of two Cambridgeshire GPs, Chris Morris was educated at Stonyhurst College}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went to study [[zoology]] at the [[University of Bristol]], where he gained a 2:1.&lt;ref name="observer_profile"&gt;{{cite news

===Radio career===
On graduating, Morris pursued a career as a musician in various bands, for which he played the bass guitar. He then went to work for Radio West, a local radio station in Bristol. He then took up a news traineeship with [[BBC Radio Cambridgeshire]], where he took advantage of access to editing and recording equipment to create elaborate [[Parody|spoofs]] and [[parody|parodies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Andy Beckett |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/prank-master-chris-morriss-announcement-of-the-death-of-michael-heseltine-on-radio-1-was-just-one-among-many-notorious-japes-his-satire-is-big-with-the-media-but-how-popular-is-it-with-listeners-1377835.html |title=Prank master: Chris Morris's announcement of the death of Michael Heseltine on Radio 1 was just one among many notorious japes. His satire is big with the media, but how popul |publisher=Independent.co.uk |date=21 August 1994 |accessdate=18 September 2013 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also spent time in early 1987 hosting a 2–4pm afternoon show and finally ended up presenting Saturday morning show ''I.T.''

In July 1987, he moved on to [[BBC Radio Bristol]] to present his own show ''No Known Cure'', broadcast on Saturday and Sunday mornings. The show was surreal and satirical, with odd interviews conducted with unsuspecting members of the public. He was fired from Bristol in 1990 after "talking over the news bulletins and making silly noises".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-76826109.html|title=Morris, the Man with a Mission to Cause Offence|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988 he also joined, from its launch, [[BBC London 94.9|Greater London Radio]] (GLR). He presented ''The Chris Morris Show'' on GLR until 1993, when one show got suspended after a sketch was broadcast involving a child "outing" celebrities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbjmgt.co.uk/artist/chris-morris |title=Chris Morris / Artists / PBJ – THE exclusive UK-based talent agency. Clients include the best performers, presenters, writers, composers, directors and producers |publisher=Pbjmgt.co.uk |date= |accessdate=18 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, Morris joined [[Armando Iannucci]]'s spoof news project ''[[On the Hour]]''. Broadcast on [[BBC Radio 4]], it saw him work alongside Iannucci, [[Steve Coogan]], [[Stewart Lee]], [[Richard Herring]] and [[Rebecca Front]]. In 1992, Morris hosted [[Danny Baker]]'s Radio 5 Morning Edition show for a week whilst Baker was on holiday. In 1994, Morris began a weekly evening show, the ''Chris Morris Music Show'', on [[BBC Radio 1]] alongside [[Peter Baynham]] and 'man with a mobile phone' [[Paul Garner (comedian)|Paul Garner]]. In the shows, Morris perfected the spoof interview style that would become a central component of his ''[[Brass Eye]]'' programme. In the same year, Morris teamed up with [[Peter Cook]] (as [[Sir Arthur Streeb-Greebling]]), in a series of improvised conversations for [[BBC Radio 3]] entitled ''[[Why Bother? (radio show)|Why Bother?]]''.

In 1994, a [[BBC Two|BBC 2]] television series based on ''On the Hour'' was broadcast under the name ''[[The Day Today]]''. ''The Day Today'' made a star of Morris, and marked the television debut of Steve Coogan's [[Alan Partridge]] character. The programme ended on a high after just one series, with Morris winning the 1994 [[British Comedy Award]] for Best Newcomer for his lead role as the [[Jeremy Paxman|Paxmanesque]] news anchor.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1460805.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; Chris Morris: Brass Neck |publisher=BBC News |date=27 July 2001 |accessdate=18 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, Morris appeared on the daytime programme [[The Time, The Place]], posing as an academic, Thurston Lowe, in a discussion entitled "Are British Men Lousy Lovers?", but was found out when a producer alerted the show's host, [[John Stapleton]].&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;

In 1997, the [[black comedy|black humour]] which had featured in ''On the Hour'' and ''The Day Today'' became more prominent in ''[[Brass Eye]]'', another spoof current affairs television documentary, shown on [[Channel 4]]. ''Brass Eye'' became known for tricking celebrities and politicians into throwing support behind public awareness campaigns for made-up issues that were often absurd or surreal (such as a drug called ''cake'' and an elephant with its trunk stuck up its [[anus]]).

From 1997 to 1999 Morris created ''[[Blue Jam]]'' for [[BBC Radio 1]], a surreal taboo-breaking radio show set to an ambient soundtrack.&lt;ref name="screenonline"/&gt; In 2000 this was followed by ''[[Jam (TV series)|Jam]]'', a television reworking.&lt;ref name="screenonline"/&gt; Morris released a 'remix' version of this, entitled ''Jaaaaam''.&lt;ref name="screenonline"/&gt;

In 2001, a special episode of ''Brass Eye'' on the [[moral panic]] that surrounds [[pedophilia|paedophilia]] attracted a record-breaking number of complaints – the total remains the third highest on UK television after ''[[Celebrity Big Brother 2007 (UK)|Celebrity Big Brother 2007]]'' and ''[[Jerry Springer: The Opera]]'' – as well as heated discussion in the press. Many complainants, some of whom later admitted to not having seen the programme (notably [[Beverley Hughes]], a government minister),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1335865/Minister-in-Brass-Eye-protest-has-not-even-seen-it.html |title=Minister in Brass Eye protest has not even seen it |first=Andy |last=McSmith |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=31 July 2001 |accessdate=20 May 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; felt the satire was directed at the victims of paedophilia, which Morris denies. Channel 4 defended the show, insisting the target was the media and its hysterical treatment of paedophilia, and not victims of crime.

In 2002, Morris ventured into film, directing the [[short film|short]] ''[[My Wrongs 8245–8249 &amp; 117|My Wrongs#8245–8249 &amp; 117]]'', adapted from a ''Blue Jam'' monologue about a man led astray by a sinister talking dog. It was the first film project of [[Warp Films]], a branch of [[Warp Records]]. In 2002 this won the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] for best short film.&lt;ref name="bafta_2002"/&gt; In 2005 Morris worked on a sitcom entitled ''[[Nathan Barley]]'', based on the character created by [[Charlie Brooker]] for his website [[TVGoHome]] (Morris had contributed to TVGoHome on occasion, under the pseudonym 'Sid Peach'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brooker|first1=Charlie|title=FULL SESSION - The Alternative MacTaggart: Charlie Brooker|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK8i2mRxX3s|website=YouTube|publisher=Guardian Edinburgh International Television Festival|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Co-written by Brooker and Morris, the series was broadcast on [[Channel 4]] in early 2005.

===Post 2005: ''The IT Crowd'', ''Comedy Vehicle'', and ''Four Lions''===
Morris was a cast member in ''[[The IT Crowd]]'', a [[Channel 4]] sitcom which focused on the information technology department of the fictional company Reynholm Industries. The series was written and directed by [[Graham Linehan]] (writer of ''[[Father Ted]]'' and ''[[Black Books]]'', with whom Morris collaborated on ''The Day Today'', ''Brass Eye'' and ''Jam'') and produced by [[Ash Atalla]] (''[[The Office (UK TV series)|The Office]]''). Morris played Denholm Reynholm, the eccentric managing director of the company. This marked the first time Morris has acted in a substantial role in a project which he has not developed himself. Morris' character appeared to leave the series during episode two of the second series. His character made a brief return in the first episode of the third series.

In November 2007, Morris wrote an article for ''[[The Observer]]'' in response to [[Ronan Bennett]]'s article published six days earlier in ''[[The Guardian]]''. Bennett's article, "Shame on us", accused the novelist [[Martin Amis]] of racism. Morris' response, "The absurd world of Martin Amis", was also highly critical of Amis; although he did not accede to Bennett's accusation of racism, Morris likened Amis to the Muslim cleric [[Abu Hamza al-Masri|Abu Hamza]] (who was jailed for [[inciting racial hatred]] in 2006), suggesting that both men employ "mock erudition, vitriol and decontextualised quotes from the Qu'ran" to incite hatred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Morris |first=Chris |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/nov/25/bookscomment.religion |title=The absurd world of Martin Amis |publisher=The Observer |date=25 November 2007 |accessdate=22 June 2008 |quote=Last week Amis was called a racist. I saw him speak at the ICA last month. Was his negativity about Islam technically racist? I don't know. What I can tell you is that Martin Amis is the new Abu Hamza. [...] Like Hamza, Amis could only make his nonsense stand up with mock erudition, vitriol and decontextualised quotes from the Koran. | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morris served as script editor for the 2009 series ''[[Stewart Lee's Comedy Vehicle]]'', working with former colleagues [[Stewart Lee]], [[Kevin Eldon]] and [[Armando Iannucci]]. He maintained this role for the second (2011) and third series (2014).

Morris completed his debut feature film ''[[Four Lions]]'' in late 2009, a satire based on a group of Islamist terrorists in Sheffield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bleedingcool.com/2009/07/17/set-shot-from-chris-morris-four-lions/|title=Set shot from Chris Morris' Four Lions|publisher=Bleeding Cool.com|accessdate=26 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It premiered at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] in January 2010 and was short-listed for the festival's World Cinema Narrative prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://festival.sundance.org/2010/press_industry/releases/2010_sundance_film_festival_announces_films_in_competition/ |title=2010 SUNDANCE FILM FESTIVAL ANNOUNCES FILMS IN COMPETITION &amp;#124; Sundance Festival 2010 |publisher=Festival.sundance.org |date= |accessdate=20 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100404133049/http://festival.sundance.org/2010/press_industry/releases/2010_sundance_film_festival_announces_films_in_competition/ |archivedate=4 April 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film (working title ''Boilerhouse'') was picked up by [[Film Four]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/wannabe-suicide-bombers-beware-chris-morris-movie-gets-goahead-1228152.html |title=Wannabe suicide bombers beware: Chris Morris movie gets go-ahead |first=Geneviève |last=Roberts |date=6 January 2009 |accessdate=20 May 2009 | work=The Independent | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morris told ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' that the film sought to do for Islamic terrorism what ''[[Dad's Army]]'', the classic BBC comedy, did for the [[National Socialists]] by showing them as "scary but also ridiculous".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Brooks |first=Richard |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/article3177654.ece |title=Satirist turns terrorists into Dad's Army |publisher=[[The Sunday Times]] |date=13 January 2008 |accessdate=13 January 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Morris directed the seventh and penultimate episode of the first season of ''[[Veep (TV series)|Veep]]'', an Armando Iannucci-devised American version of ''[[The Thick of It]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2161219/ | title=Veep: Season 1, Episode 7 Full Disclosure (3 Jun. 2012) | publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]] | accessdate=23 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, he returned to direct two episodes for the second season of ''Veep'', and a further episode for season three in 2014.

In 2013, Morris appeared briefly in Richard Ayoade's [[The Double (2013 film)|''The Double'']], a black comedy film based on the [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]] [[The Double (Fyodor Dostoyevsky novel)|novella of the same name]]. Morris had previously worked with Ayoade on ''Nathan Barley'' and ''The IT Crowd''.

In February 2014, Morris made a surprise appearance at the beginning of a [[Stewart Lee]] live show, introducing the comedian with fictional anecdotes about their work together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chortle|title=Chris Morris, live on stage|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2014/02/16/19608/chris_morris,_live_on_stage?rss|publisher=Chortle|accessdate=17 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following month, Morris appeared in the third series of ''Stewart Lee's Comedy Vehicle'' as a "hostile interrogator",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Stewart|title=The material is cooking with gas|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/features/2014/02/19/19633/the_material_is_cooking_with_gas|publisher=Chortle|accessdate=19 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; a role previously occupied by Armando Iannucci.

In December 2014, it was announced that a short radio collaboration with [[Noel Fielding]] and Richard Ayoade would be broadcast on BBC Radio 6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=BBC|title=Chris Morris Exclusive|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04tm3qb|website=www.bbc.co.uk/programmes|publisher=BBC|accessdate=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an interview with Fielding in 2011, the work had already been in progress for five years by that point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Noel Fielding: Radio Past and Future|url=http://thevelvetonion.com/2011/11/03/radio-past-and-future/|website=thevelvetonion.com/|publisher=The Velvet Onion|accessdate=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was decided, 'in consultation with [Morris]', that the project was not yet complete, and so the intended broadcast did not go ahead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Chris Morris sketch 'not ready yet'|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2014/12/08/21449/new_chris_morris_sketch_not_ready_yet|website=www.chortle.co.uk|publisher=Chortle|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A statement released by [[Film4]] in February 2016 made reference to funding what will be Morris' second feature-film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Channel 4 announces major increase to Film4 funding'|url=http://blog.film4.com/channel-4-announces-major-increase-to-film4-funding|website=www.film4.co.uk|publisher=Film4|accessdate=9 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2017 it was reported that Morris had shot the movie, starring [[Anna Kendrick]], in the [[Dominican Republic]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/chris-morris-film-2018-new-four-lions-brass-eye-anna-kendrick-a8079696.html|title=Brass Eye's Chris Morris has secretly shot a film in the Caribbean starring Anna Kendrick|date=2017-11-28|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-12-03|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the title was not made public.

==Music==
Morris often co-writes and performs incidental music for his television shows, notably with ''Jam'' and the 'extended remix' version, ''Jaaaaam''. In the early 1990s Morris contributed a [[Pixies]] parody track entitled "Motherbanger" to a [[Flexi disc|flexi-disc]] given away with an edition of [[select magazine|Select]] music magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQqzF7NdoXI|title=Chris Morris – Mother Banger (Pixies Parody)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morris supplied sketches for British band [[Saint Etienne (band)|Saint Etienne]]'s 1993 single "[[You're in a Bad Way]]" (the sketch 'Spongbake' appears at the end of the 4th track on the CD single).
In 2000, he collaborated by mail with [[Amon Tobin]] to create the track "Bad Sex", which was released as a B-side on the Tobin single "Slowly".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Amon-Tobin-Slowly/release/29172 |title=Amon Tobin (feat Chris Morris at Discogs |publisher=Discogs.com |date=21 May 2002 |accessdate=20 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
British band [[Stereolab]]'s song "Nothing to Do with Me" from their 2001 album ''[[Sound-Dust]]'' featured various lines from Chris Morris sketches as lyrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nme.com/news/stereolab/8265 |title=Stereolab's 'Jam' Session |work=[[NME]] |date=21 June 2001 |accessdate=20 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition==
In 2003, Morris was listed in ''[[The Observer]]'' as one of the 50 funniest acts in British comedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,11710,1101525,00.html|title=The A-Z of laughter (part two)|publisher=The Observer |date=7 December 2003 |accessdate=13 January 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, [[Channel 4]] aired a show called ''The Comedian's Comedian'' in which foremost writers and performers of comedy ranked their 50 favourite acts.

In 2010, a biography, ''Disgusting Bliss: The Brass Eye of Chris Morris'', was published. Written by Lucian Randall, the book depicted Morris as "brilliant but uncompromising", and a "frantic-minded perfectionist".&lt;ref name="Day"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2010/apr/04/disgusting-bliss-chris-morris-biography |title=Disgusting Bliss by Lucian Randall|last=Day|first=Elizabeth|date=4 June 2010|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=7 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2014, a three-hour retrospective of Morris' radio career was broadcast on [[BBC Radio 4 Extra]] under the title 'Raw Meat Radio', presented by [[Mary Anne Hobbs]] and featuring interviews with [[Armando Iannucci]], [[Peter Baynham]], [[Paul Garner (comedian)|Paul Garner]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Black|first1=Sophie|title=BBC - Raw Meat Radio|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/proginfo/2014/48/raw-meat-radio|website=www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Morris lives in [[Brixton]], with his wife, actress turned literary agent Jo Unwin.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite news|last=Maher|first=Kevin|title=The return of the most hated man in Britain|newspaper=The Times|date=3 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pair met in 1984 at the [[Edinburgh Festival]], when he was playing bass guitar for the [[Cambridge Footlights]] Revue and she was in a comedy troupe called the Millies.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; They have two sons, Charles and Frederick, both of whom were born in [[London Borough of Lambeth|Lambeth]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; Until the release of ''Four Lions'' he gave very few interviews and little had been published about Morris' personal life. In 2010 he made numerous media appearances to promote and support the film, both in the UK and US, at one point appearing as a guest on ''[[Late Night with Jimmy Fallon]]''.

Morris can be heard as himself in a 2008 podcast for [[CERN]], being taken on a tour of the facility by the physicist [[Brian Cox (physicist)|Brian Cox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/audio/2008/jun/30/cern.chris.morris.podcast |title=Cern podcast: Chris Morris visits the Large Hadron Collider |publisher=The Guardian |date=30 June 2008 |accessdate=20 May 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morris has a large [[birthmark]] on his face, which he usually covers with makeup when acting.
