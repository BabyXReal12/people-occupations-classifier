'''Anthony Jeselnik''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|j|ɛ|s|əl|n|ɪ|k}} {{respell|YES|əl|nik}}; born December 22, 1978) is an American comedian, writer, actor, and producer. He is known for his [[dark comedy]] style, which emphasizes ironic misdirection, [[Non sequitur (literary device)|non sequitur]]s, biting insults, an arrogant demeanour, and a [[stage persona]] that frequently takes [[amorality|amoral]] stances.

Jeselnik was a writer for ''[[Late Night with Jimmy Fallon]]'' in its first season and hosted a ''[[Comedy Central Presents]]'' in 2009. After releasing his critically acclaimed debut album ''[[Shakespeare (album)|Shakespeare]]'' in 2010, he began writing for the [[Comedy Central Roasts]] and moved up to performer in the 2011 roast of [[Donald Trump]]. He continued to perform on the roasts of [[Charlie Sheen]] and [[Roseanne Barr]] in 2012. In 2013, he hosted his own [[Comedy Central]] series, ''[[The Jeselnik Offensive]]'', for two seasons and released his second album, ''[[Caligula (album)|Caligula]]'', which doubles as an hour-long standup special.

On July 22, 2015, Jeselnik replaced [[JB Smoove]] as the new host of NBC's Emmy Award-nominated series ''[[Last Comic Standing]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbc.com/last-comic-standing "Last Comic Standing Returns"], ''nbc.com'', retrieved June 28, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; His second stand-up special, ''Thoughts and Prayers'', premiered in October 2015 on [[Netflix]].
Jeselnik starred in the first season of the NFL Media podcast "RJVP" along with friend Gregg Rosenthal. A second season is expected.

==Early life==
Anthony Jeselnik was born in [[Pittsburgh]], Pennsylvania, on December 22, 1978, the son of Stephanie and Anthony F. Jeselnik, whose surname and ancestry originates from Slovenia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://boards.ancestry.com/localities.eeurope.slovenia.general/2630.1/mb.ashx Family names in Slovenia], ''ancestry.com''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.post-gazette.com/hp_mobile/2013/02/18/TV-preview-Anthony-Jeselnik-loves-being-the-jerk-on-new-comedy-show/stories/2013021803200000000 | work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | first=Rob | last=Owen | title=TV preview: Anthony Jeselnik loves being the jerk on new comedy show | date=February 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was raised in [[Upper St. Clair Township, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Upper St. Clair]].&lt;ref name="collier"&gt;{{Cite news |first=Sean |last=Collier |date=July 2011 |title=King of Zing |magazine=[[Pittsburgh Magazine]] |url=http://www.pittsburghmagazine.com/Pittsburgh-Magazine/July-2011/Anthony-Jeselnik-Rules-the-Roast/ |accessdate=February 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jeselnik was interested in making others laugh from an early age. In elementary school, he would often interrupt the class to tell a joke. On one occasion, a classmate was moving to a different town that was not generally regarded well, and Jeselnik cracked a sarcastic comment: "Oh, well, send us a postcard."&lt;ref name="avclub"/&gt; When the teacher laughed at his joke, he realized that "if you're smart enough that adults get it, you can get away with anything."&lt;ref name="avclub"/&gt; He would often stay up attempting to watch ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' and, as he grew older, ''[[The Ben Stiller Show]]'' and ''[[Mr. Show]]''.&lt;ref name="avclub"/&gt; He graduated from [[Upper St. Clair High School]] in 1997. Jeselnik earned a bachelor's degree in English literature with a business minor from [[Tulane University]] in 2001. During his senior year at Tulane, his girlfriend accidentally burned down his apartment, which he would later use as early standup material.&lt;ref name="avclub"/&gt; He was a member of Alpha Tau Omega fraternity while at [[Tulane University]].  His original dream was to write the [[great American novel]], but an internship in Los Angeles between his junior and senior years of college convinced him there were other avenues for a writer.&lt;ref name="postgazette"&gt;{{Cite news |first=Rob |last=Owen|date=February 18, 2013|title=

In his early twenties, Jeselnik moved to Los Angeles and was working at a [[Borders Group|Borders]] when he first tried standup. He found a book by writer and comedian Greg Dean that promoted Dean's [[Santa Monica]] comedy workshops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Collins |first=Ashley Wren |date=2011 |title=The Cheap Bastard's Guide to Los Angeles |url=https://books.google.com/?id=u80fTVo-9RwC&amp;pg=PA40&amp;lpg=PA40&amp;dq=%22greg+dean%22+%22santa+monica%22+%22comedy%22+%22workshop%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22greg%20dean%22%20%22santa%20monica%22%20%22comedy%22%20%22workshop%22&amp;f=false |location=Guilford, CT |publisher=Globe Pequot Press |page=40 |isbn=978-0-7627-6003-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="grantland"/&gt; In his first attempt at a joke, Jeselnik did an impression of his father being stung by wasps. By the end of the skit&amp;mdash;which lasted only one minute, but Jeselnik claimed "felt like 10"&amp;mdash;no one had laughed, leading Jeselnik to swear off physical comedy forever.&lt;ref name="avclub"/&gt; After being fired by Borders, he worked as an accounting clerk for ''[[Deadwood (TV series)|Deadwood]]'', during which time he would perform at open-mic nights.&lt;ref name="avclub"/&gt; Inspired in part by [[Mitch Hedberg]], [[Dennis Miller]], [[Sarah Silverman]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WH8gV8wZgks|title=Anthony Jeselnik does TMI|date=February 16, 2012|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Steven Wright]], it was two years into his standup comedy career when Jeselnik had a "lightbulb moment."&lt;ref name="grantland"/&gt; After writing a bizarre joke with a dark twist to it, the audience response encouraged Jeselnik to focus more in that area. The joke, titled "My Girlfriend Loves to Eat Chocolate," was later featured on ''Shakespeare''.&lt;ref name="avclub"&gt;{{cite web |title=Anthony Jeselnik on roasting, ripping off Jack Handey, and giving the devil his own TV show|author=Nathan Rabin|publisher=''[[The A.V.

The Cellar comedians, known for busting the chops of other comedians, were influential to Jeselnik, and he said that the best at it were [[Jim Norton (comedian)|Jim Norton]], [[Colin Quinn]], [[Bobby Kelly]], and [[Keith Robinson (comedian)|Keith Robinson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagonow.com/class-act-comedy/2013/01/comedy-centrals-anthony-jeselnik-exclusive-interview/|title=Anthony Jeselnik: Q&amp;A on roasts, Jeff Ross and dating Amy Schumer|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Jeselnik's ''[[Comedy Central Presents]]'' standup special premiered in 2009, and he was named one of [[Comedy Central]]'s breakout comedians of the year alongside [[Nick Kroll]], [[Aziz Ansari]], [[Whitney Cummings]], [[Donald Glover]], [[Matt Braunger]], [[T. J. Miller]], [[Kumail Nanjiani]], and [[Jon Lajoie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Hot List|url=http://ccinsider.comedycentral.com/2009/12/07/the-hot-list-the-9-best-breakout-comedians-of-2009|work=Comedy Central|accessdate=February 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Jeselnik was hired as a writer for ''[[Late Night with Jimmy Fallon]]''. His dream job, predating standup or his first comedy class, was to sit around a table and "throw out jokes with people you respected."&lt;ref name="grantland"/&gt; After getting the job, Jeselnik's pitches would be continually shot down as they were too dark. For example, he routinely fought for a single joke regarding [[obesity]] each day for a month, and although Fallon liked the joke, he felt uncomfortable performing it as it would likely jeopardize his likability with the obese.&lt;ref name="grantland"/&gt; During this period, he was a regular at the [[Comedy Cellar]] in [[Greenwich Village]], New York City.&lt;ref name="maron"&gt;Maron, Marc (September 1, 2011). Episode 206: Anthony Jeselnik. ''[[WTF with Marc Maron]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Jeselnik would work hard each day for the show and then proceed to go to Comedy Cellar, have a "big stiff drink," and do his act, feeling "miserable." In March 2010, he approached the show's producers and told them he wanted to leave. "We understand—you want to go be Anthony Jeselnik," they said.&lt;ref name="grantland"/&gt;

He recorded his debut album, ''[[Shakespeare (album)|Shakespeare]]'', and in 2010 began writing for the [[Comedy Central Roasts]]. Jeselnik, who refers to roasts as "the [[Super Bowl]] of comedy," loved roasts during college and always tried to write for them.&lt;ref name="avclub"/&gt; While Jeselnik was writing for the [[David Hasselhoff]] roast, Comedy Central executives took an interest in him and offered him an opportunity to perform on the next roast. Knowing that this would be his "big moment," Jeselnik refers to the Roast of [[Donald Trump]] as "one of my favorite moments of my life […] because no one knew who I was and it just really caught everybody by surprise. And the next day, my life was completely different."&lt;ref name="avclub"/&gt; While Jeselnik had previously been headlining clubs, the audience often was unfamiliar with his brand of comedy; after the Trump roast, the crowds got bigger and Jeselnik felt more comfortable.&lt;ref name="avclub"/&gt; Immediately following his performance, the network offered Jeselnik a "three-point deal" in which one receives an hour special, three Comedy Central roasts, and a development deal.&lt;ref name="grantland"/&gt; Jeselnik went on to perform at two more roasts, the Comedy Central Roasts of [[Charlie Sheen]] in 2011 and [[Roseanne Barr]] in 2012.&lt;ref name="grantland"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HuffPo"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Comedy Central Roast of Charlie Sheen (UPDATES)|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/09/10/comedy-central-roast-of-charlie-sheen_n_956885.html#17_jon-lovitz-up-first|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=September 26, 2011|date=September 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Donnelly |first=Matt |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/gossip/la-et-mg-roseanne-roast-jeff-ross-aurora-jokes,0,7374734.story |title=Roseanne Barr roast was even ruder than you'll see on TV |publisher=latimes.com |date=August 6, 2012 |accessdate=February 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jeselnik appeared at the Power of Comedy event in November 2012.&lt;ref name="The Los Angeles Times"&gt;{{cite news|last=Donnelly|first=Matt|title=The Los Angeles Times – Seth MacFarlane honored at Variety's Power of Comedy|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/gossip/la-et-mg-seth-macfarlane-power-of-comedy-variety,0,977088.story|work=The Los Angeles Times|publisher=The Los Angeles Times|accessdate=November 25, 2012|date=November 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Extra&gt;{{cite web|title=Extra – Seth MacFarlane to Receive 'Power of Comedy' Award|url=http://www.extratv.com/2012/11/01/seth-macfarlane-to-receive-power-of-comedy-award/|work=Extra|publisher=Extra|accessdate=November 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Jeselnik hosted his own [[Comedy Central]] series, ''[[The Jeselnik Offensive]]''. In preparing the show, Comedy Central was looking for a half-hour, four-nights-a-week show following ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' titled ''Midnight''.&lt;ref name="grantland"/&gt; Jeselnik's main draw was the monologue, where he felt he could tell jokes that he was unable to do on ''Late Night with Jimmy Fallon''. For the pilot, Jeselnik did a test interview with a celebrity but felt "so wrong […] it just fit me like a bad suit."&lt;ref name="avclub"/&gt; For the show's first episode, Jeselnik performs cancer-related standup for a cancer support group. "I had to fight with Comedy Central to put that on the first episode," said Jeselnik. The network felt uneasy using the sketch as an introduction.&lt;ref name="avclub"/&gt; Jeselnik pointed to the premiere episode of ''[[Chappelle's Show]]'', in which [[Dave Chappelle]] plays a blind African-American [[Ku Klux Klan|Klansman]], which he regarded as "one of the edgiest things they ever did." As such, the sketch opened the first episode and received a positive reception; [[Jay Leno]] called to inform Jeselnik "how much he loved the cancer segment."&lt;ref name="avclub"/&gt; ''The Jeselnik Offensive'' ran for two seasons on [[Comedy Central]] from February 19, 2013 to August 27, 2013.

Jeselnik's first standup special, ''Caligula'', premiered in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Comedy Central Profile|url=http://www.comedycentral.com/comedians/anthony-jeselnik|accessdate=January 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Berkowitz|first=Daniel|title=Anthony Jeselnik Caligula special review|url=http://www.thespittake.com/2013/01/08/anthony-jeselnik-caligula-comedy-central/|publisher=The Spit Take|accessdate=April 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

October 2015 saw the debut of ''The Rosenthal &amp; Jeselnik Vanity Project'' (RJVP), a podcast available on NFL.com hosted by Jeselnik and fellow Tulane graduate, NFL Network's Gregg Rosenthal.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Megh (October 29, 2015).

[[SplitSider]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 Jeselnik released his critically acclaimed third stand up special, and first for Netflix, ''Thoughts and Prayers''.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=https://www.netflix.com/title/80043049|title=Anthony Jeselnik presents Thoughts and Prayers}} &lt;/ref&gt; The hour long stand-up shows Jeselnik's trademark dark humor for the first 40 minutes and for the first time personal anecdotes for the last 20 minutes. He discusses his grandmother's funeral, the Boston marathon bombing, cancellation of the Jeselnik Offensive, and the death threats he receives. Thoughts and Prayers was widely regarded as one of the best stand up specials of 2015.
