'''Severn Teakle Darden Jr.''' (November 9, 1929 – May 27, 1995) was an American [[comedian]] and actor, and an original member of [[The Second City]] Chicago-based comedy troupe as well as its predecessor, the [[Compass Players]]. He is perhaps best known from his film appearances for playing the human leader [[List of Planet of the Apes characters#Kolp|Kolp]] in the fourth and fifth ''Planet of the Apes'' films.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web|title=Severn Darden, 65, a Master of Improvisation|first=Ronald|last=Sullivan|date=May 27, 1995|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/27/obituaries/severn-darden-65-a-master-of-improvisation.html|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Born in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], he attended the [[University of Chicago]].  Darden’s offbeat and intellectual sense of humor, appropriate for someone who attended the University of Chicago and in fact a major element in the style of The Second City at that time, is evident throughout his work.

One example of his offbeat humor is the way he squeezed the phrase "[[Know thyself]]" into the seven-character limitation of a [[New Mexico]] [[license plate]]: '''NOYOSEF'''.

Darden appeared in various movies and television series. His best performance is probably in the comedy ''[[The President's Analyst]]''; there he has a major role as Kropotkin, a Soviet agent with a laid-back persona (much like Darden's own). An early film, ''"LUV" (1967)'' (based on the play of the same title by [[Murray Schisgal]]), in which he played a junk dealer, also starred [[Jack Lemmon]], [[Peter Falk]], [[Elaine May]], and [[Nina Wayne]].

One of his earliest TV roles was on ''[[Car 54 Where Are You?]]'' in the episode "Toody and the Art World" in which he played the artist Karpathia.

He also played a [[wiktionary:stuffed shirt|stuffed shirt]] toy manufacturer in an episode of ''[[The Monkees (TV series)|The Monkees]]'' and Dr. Herb Chisholm in a 1976 episode of the [[NBC]] [[situation comedy]] ''[[The Practice (1976 TV series)|The Practice]]''. He appeared in "Never Con a Killer," the pilot for the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] crime drama ''[[The Feather and Father Gang]]'', in 1977. He played the cold-hearted [[Kolp (Planet of the Apes)|Kolp]] in ''[[Conquest of the Planet of the Apes]]'' and ''[[Battle for the Planet of the Apes]]'', and a highly respected, but befuddled college dean, in the [[1985 in film|1985]] comedy ''[[Real Genius]]''.

In 1986, he was featured in the Off-Broadway improvisational sketch comedy show, ''[[Sills &amp; Company]],'' directed by [[Paul Sills]].

After triple heart bypass surgery, he lived in semi-retirement in Los Angeles before moving to Santa Fe, New Mexico in 1992. He died there of congestive heart failure at age 65. His interment was at Lake Lawn Park and Mausoleum in his hometown of New Orleans.

==Works==

===Routines===

====''The Metaphysics Lecture''====
This was ostensibly given by Prof. Walther von der Vogelweide, a reference to the [[Walther von der Vogelweide|famous medieval poet]] of the same name. An announcer introduces it as ''A Short Talk on the Universe'', and then Darden continues: "Now, why — you will ask me — have I chosen to speak on the Universe, rather than some other topic.  Well, it's very simple: there isn’t anything else!" The lecture is loaded with digressions.

====''Oedipus''====
This was another Prof. Walther von der Vogelweide lecture (with the assistance of the rest of the Second City cast). The subject was "free will and necessity in the light of...''Oedipus Rex''", or "what would have happened to Oedipus if he had read the book before going on the journey". The professor plays the role of [[Oedipus]] and refuses to perform the acts that would lead to his fate, but finds that despite his apparent [[agency (philosophy)|agency]] the other characters respond in ways that produce the same results.

In the first scene, Oedipus encounters his father [[Laius]], knowing that if all goes according to the book the two will get into a [[Punch (combat)|brawl]], and he will commit the serious sin of [[patricide|killing his own father]].  Aware of this, Oedipus is very deferential to Laius, only to find that the father is extremely touchy and hostile to anything that smacks of [[sycophant|sycophancy]].  Despite Oedipus' continued deference and protestations, Laius becomes increasingly angry until he suddenly suffers a fatal [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]].

In the next scene, the [[Sphinx]] energetically  tries to wheedle him into answering her riddle correctly, which Oedipus does not want to do. At one point she says, "Think of the power—of the glory—". He responds, "I don't need power and glory, I'm a [[full professor]]."

In the final scene, Oedipus prepares to gouge his eyes out. At the last second, he stops when he realizes that the tragic choices were actually forced on him against his will. He explains all this to the crowd, ending with "It's not my fault!" The crowd agrees, and his eyes are saved. The professor ends the sketch by saying, "So you see, my dear students, the lesson that we learn from this is that Man ''has'' free will, but tragic poets do not, and Art is not Nature."

====''Football Comes to the University of Chicago''====
This sketch was originally developed for the Compass Players and revisited for Second City. It satirized the university and its students, presenting a possible explanation for the failure to introduce football. A typical coach teaches "Football 202" and struggles with the intellectual students. Darden plays Morgenstern, a student who states his field is the "history of arithmetic". After the coach mentions the football positions called "ends", Morgenstern asks where the beginnings for those ends are, because ends must have beginnings, according to [[Aristotle]]. The coach presents the football, and Morgenstern declares, "It's a demi-poly-tetrahedron."

===Television series===
* ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'', "Beta Delta Gamma" (1961)
* ''[[Charlie Paradise]]'' TV series pilot (1960). Darden played an eccentric painter named Flute who is murdered in his Greenwich Village studio in this unsold pilot intended as a spinoff to the Edward Binns CBS drama "Brenner", and which was eventually repackaged for air as the last episode of the series.
* ''[[Car 54, Where Are You?]]'': "Toody and the Art World" (1962). Darden plays Karpathia, a painter whose work appears to awaken an enthusiasm for modern art in Toody. This episode is particularly notable because Karpathia's temperament and accent somewhat resemble those of Professor Walther von der Vogelweide. Thus the portrayal gives us a hint of what Darden was like in his lectures. Darden's scenes take up about 9 minutes of the episode.
* ''[[Honey West (TV series)|Honey West]]'', "Little Green Robin Hood" (1966)
* ''[[The Monkees (TV series)|The Monkees]]'', "Monkee vs. Machine" (1966). He plays the confused president of a toy company who is manipulated by Daggart ([[Stan Freberg]]), a scheming executive who wants to make shoddier toys for the purpose of "planned obsolescence".
* ''[[The Monkees (TV series)|The Monkees]]'', "The Monkee's Paw" (1968). In a very brief scene, Darden has the role of a psychiatrist who angrily insists that the Monkees' interpretations of inkblots are wrong. This is notable because the portrayal is exactly like Professor Walther von der Vogelweide in his most vehement moments.
* ''[[I Dream of Jeannie ]]'', "Jeannie and the Great Bank Robbery" (1967)
* ''[[Daniel Boone (1964 TV series)|Daniel Boone]]'' (1968)
* ''[[It Takes a Thief (1968 TV series)|It Takes a Thief]], "Saturday Night In Venice" (1969)
* ''[[Alias Smith and Jones]], "Never Trust An Honest Man" (1971) In a dual role, as father and son.
* ''[[Night Gallery]]'': "You Can't Get Help Like That Anymore" (1972)
* ''[[Kolchak: The Night Stalker]]'': "The Spanish Moss Murders" (1974)
* ''[[The Ghost Busters]]'': "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde...Together, for the First Time!" (1975)
* ''[[Barney Miller]]'', "The Mole" (1975)
* ''Captains and the Kings'' (1976)
* ''[[The Six Million Dollar Man]]'', episodes "The Secret of Bigfoot" (parts I and II) and "The Return of Bigfoot, part I" (all 1976).
* ''[[The Bionic Woman]]'', "The Return of Bigfoot: Part II"  (1976)
* ''[[Cheers]]'', "Homicidal Ham," with fellow Second City alumni [[Shelley Long]] and [[George Wendt]]. (1983)
* ''[[The Paper Chase (TV series)|The Paper Chase]]'', "The War of the Wonks" (1984)
* ''[[Faerie Tale Theatre]]'', "The Princess Who Had Never Laughed" (1986)
