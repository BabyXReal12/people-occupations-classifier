'''Ross Shafer''' (born '''Ross Alan Shafer''' is an American [[comedian]] and network [[television]] host-turned-[[motivational speaker|motivational and leadership speaker/consultant]], based in [[Denver]], [[Colorado]].

==Biography==
Born and raised in [[McMinnville, Oregon]], Shafer graduated from Federal Way High School in [[Federal Way, Washington]]. As a high school All Conference [[American football|football]] player, he received a scholarship to play linebacker for the [[University of Puget Sound]] in [[Tacoma, Washington]], where he earned a business marketing degree.

Shafer began his career as a small-town pet-store manager-turned-[[stand-up comic]] in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], after winning the [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] [[cable network]]'s 1983 Showtime Comedy Laugh-Off. The following year, he created and hosted a late-night [[comedy]] series called ''[[Almost Live!]]'' on TV station [[KING-TV|KING]] Channel 5. 
After four and a half years and nearly 40 Emmy Awards,{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Shafer moved to Los Angeles to host the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox Network]]'s ''[[The Late Show (1986 TV series)|The Late Show]]''. Shafer's first national [[Television program|TV show]] was the [[USA Network]]'s ''[[Love Me, Love Me Not (game show)|Love Me, Love Me Not]]'', taped in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]]. The show ran for 130 episodes and aired in [[Italy]] under the name ''Mama No Mama''.

In 1985, Shafer spearheaded an effort to replace ''[[Washington, My Home]]'' by Helen Davis with ''[[Louie Louie]]'' as Washington's official state song.&lt;ref&gt;''Seattle Weekly'' (October 27, 1999) Music: [http://www.seattleweekly.com/music/9943/two-reighley.php "The State I'm In"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060821164549/http://www.seattleweekly.com/music/9943/two-reighley.php|date=2006-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Picking up on this initially prankish effort, [[Whatcom County, Washington|Whatcom County]] Councilman Craig Cole introduced Resolution No. 85-12 in the state legislature, citing the need for a "contemporary theme song that can be used to engender a sense of pride and community, and in the enhancement of tourism and economic development." His resolution also called for the creation of a new "Louie Louie County". While the House did not pass it, the Senate's Resolution 1985-37 declared April 12, 1985, "Louie Louie Day." A crowd of 4,000, estimated by press reports, convened on the state capital that day for speeches, singalongs and performances by the Wailers, the Kingsmen, and Paul Revere and the Raiders. Three days later, a Seattle event commemorated the occasion with the premiere performance of a new, Washington-centric version of the song written by [[Richard Berry (musician)|Richard Berry]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xs4all.nl/~tdg/dg/Comps/rhino2.html Liner notes, ''The Best Of Louie Louie Volume 2''] (Rhino R1 70515); accessed January 26, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, Shafer succeeded [[Arsenio Hall]] as host of the Fox Network [[talk show]] ''[[The Late Show (1986 TV series)|The Late Show]]'', which had originally starred [[Joan Rivers]]. The stint lasted one year, after which Shafer co-hosted the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] network magazine show ''Days End'' with rotating hosts [[Spencer Christian]], [[Matt Lauer]], and [[Hannah Storm]]. From 1990 to 1991, Shafer hosted a revival of ''[[The Match Game|Match Game]]'' on ABC Daytime.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

In 1994, Ross began writing and producing a series of 14 [[human resources|human resource]] training [[films]], distributed worldwide in nine languages. He also wrote and produced the comedy album ''Inside the First Family'', about the travails and rumors surrounding the [[Clinton Administration]].{{citation needed|date=October 2016|reason=this is a real published CD|https://www.allmusic.com/album/inside-the-first-family-mw0000082340=|https://www.fye.com/ross-shafer---inside-the-first-family-rovi.MR0000022819.html=}}

Today, Ross is in high demand as a keynote speaker and leadership coach in the areas of market share growth, customer friction, and workforce motivator. He coined the phrase "customer empathy," created the Customer Empathy Institute at California State University, Monterey Bay, speaks at over 90 corporate events each year, and has written books including ''Nobody Moved Your Cheese: How to Ignore the Experts and Trust Your Gut'', ''The Customer Shouts Back!'', ''Customer Empathy,'' ''Grab More Market Share, Absolutely Necessary, Behave Like A Startup, Success: It's on You, and No More Customer Friction''. Separately, he wrote the comedy-[[cookbook]]-for-men, ''Cook Like A Stud''. Ross and author Garry Poole founded the Other-Focused Certified Service program for front office medical and dental team members. That program has spread nationwide.
