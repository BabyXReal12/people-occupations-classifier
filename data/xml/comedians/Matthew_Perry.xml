== Career ==
[[File:Matthew Perry 1995.jpg|251x251px|thumb|Perry departing rehearsal for the [[47th Primetime Emmy Awards|1995 Emmy Awards]]]]
When he was 15, Perry moved from Ottawa to Los Angeles to pursue acting and attended [[Buckley School (California)|The Buckley School]] in Sherman Oaks, graduating in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Imperiale|first1=Nancy|title=Matthew Perry Was Tennis Whiz|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1995-10-15/entertainment/9510090598_1_matthew-perry-noah-wyle-sliders|accessdate=January 10, 2017|work=The Orlando Sentinel|date=October 15, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Summer|first1=Sydne|title=My Reunion with Matthew Perry|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/58519/my-reunion-with-matthew-perry|accessdate=January 10, 2017|work=E! Online|date=May 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He pursued improv comedy at the LA Connection in Sherman Oaks while still in high school.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

He went on to play Chazz Russell in the TV series ''[[Second Chance (1987 TV series)|Second Chance]]''. After 13 episodes, ''Second Chance'' became ''[[Boys Will Be Boys (TV series)|Boys Will Be Boys]]'', with the plots refocused on the adventures of Chazz and his teenage friends. After the show's single season, Perry stayed in Los Angeles and made his screen debut in the 1988 film ''[[A Night in the Life of Jimmy Reardon]]''.&lt;ref name="yahoo1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800018621/bio|title=Matthew Perry|publisher=[[Yahoo!

In the midst of his many continuing guest roles on TV, Perry was cast as a regular on the 1990 [[CBS]] sitcom ''[[Sydney (TV series)|Sydney]]'', playing the younger brother of [[Valerie Bertinelli]]'s title character. In 1991, he made a guest appearance on ''[[Beverly Hills, 90210]]'' as Roger Azarian. Perry landed his next TV starring role on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] sitcom ''[[Home Free (1993 TV series)|Home Free]]'', which aired only 11 episodes in the spring of 1993. By then, Perry was making his mark, and was instantly cast in a sitcom pilot titled ''LAX 2194''. 

The project was slow to take off so, as a back-up option, he attempted to secure an audition for the pilot ''Six of One'', later to be known as ''[[Friends]]'', by [[Marta Kauffman]] and [[David Crane (producer)|David Crane]], both of whom he had worked with on ''[[Dream On (TV series)|Dream On]]''. However, due to previous commitments to the pilot ''LAX 2194'', he was not initially considered for an audition. When he did eventually get a reading, he landed the part of [[Chandler Bing]].&lt;ref name="yahoo1"/&gt;

''Friends'' was hugely successful, and Perry, along with his co-stars, gained wide recognition among television viewers. The program earned him an [[Emmy]] nomination&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/matthew-perry|title=Matthew Perry|work=Television Academy}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2002 for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor - Comedy Series|Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series]], along with [[Matt LeBlanc]], but the two lost to [[Ray Romano]]. Perry appeared in films such as ''[[Fools Rush In (1997 film)|Fools Rush In]]'' (alongside father [[John Bennett Perry]] and [[Salma Hayek]]), ''[[Almost Heroes]]'', ''[[Three to Tango]]'', ''[[The Whole Nine Yards (film)|The Whole Nine Yards]]'' (alongside [[Bruce Willis]]) and its sequel ''[[The Whole Ten Yards]]'', and ''[[Serving Sara]]''.&lt;ref name="yahoo1"/&gt;

While known primarily for his comic roles, Perry has carved out a career in drama as well, particularly in his portrayal of Associate [[White House Counsel]] Joe Quincy in [[Aaron Sorkin]]'s ''[[The West Wing (TV series)|The West Wing]]''. His three appearances in that series (twice in the fourth season and once in the fifth) earned him two [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] nominations for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series in 2003 and 2004. Perry is referred to in the show prior to his guest appearance - Donna Moss seeks him out (off screen) in the episode "20 Hours in LA." He also appeared as attorney Todd Merrick in two episodes near the end of ''[[Ally McBeal]]'''s five-season run, including a 2-hour special intended to revive the legal comedy-drama.&lt;ref name="yahoo1"/&gt;

After ''[[Friends]]'' wrapped up, Perry made his directorial debut in an episode of the 4th season of the American comedy-drama ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]'', in which he also guest starred as "Murray Marks", an operator of a small airport's traffic control team. Murray is asked to donate a kidney to his father Gregory (played by Perry's real father).&lt;ref name="yahoo1"/&gt;
[[File:Matthew Perry 2010.jpg|thumb|304x304px|Perry in 2010]]

He starred in the [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]] movie, ''[[The Ron Clark Story]]'' which premiered August 13, 2006. Perry played small-town teacher [[Ron Clark (teacher)|Ron Clark]] who relocates to the toughest class in the country. Perry received a [[Golden Globe]] nomination as well as an [[Emmy]] nomination for his performance.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

In 2006-2007, Perry appeared in [[Aaron Sorkin]]'s drama ''[[Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip]]''. Perry played Matt Albie alongside [[Bradley Whitford]]'s Danny Tripp, a writer-director duo brought in to help save a failing [[Sketch comedy|sketch show]]. Perry's character was considered to be substantially based on Sorkin's own personal experiences, particularly in television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117936967?categoryid=14&amp;cs=1|title=''Variety'' announces Matthew Perry in ''Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip''|work=Variety|date=January 26, 2006|accessdate=September 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, he began filming ''[[Numb (film)|Numb]]'', a film based on a man suffering from [[depersonalization disorder]]. The film's tentative release date was pushed back several times, but was finally released to DVD on May 13, 2008.

Perry completed a 28-day program in 1997 for a [[Hydrocodone/paracetamol|Eutanazol]] addiction. His weight fluctuated drastically over the next few years and once dropped down to {{convert|145|lb|kg}}. He lost {{convert|20|lb|kg}} in 2000 due to [[pancreatitis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smolowe|first=Jill|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20133850,00.html|title=Show Stopper - Substance Abuse, Friends, Rocky Road Rehab, Matthew Perry|work=People|date=March 12, 2001|accessdate=September 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He again entered rehab in February 2001 for addiction to Vicodin, [[methadone]], [[substituted amphetamine|amphetamine]]s, and alcohol.&lt;ref name="opiates"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opiates.com/media/vicodin-addiction-usatoday.html|title=Addiction to Vicodin: Matthew Perry's Painful Story|work=USA Today via Opiates.com|author=Ann Oldenburg|accessdate=September 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,999472,00.html|title=Who's Feeling No Pain?|work=Time Magazine|author=Richard Corlliss and Jeffrey Ressner|date=March 19, 2001|accessdate=November 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2001/02/26/entertainment/main274753.shtml|title=Friends Star Perry Enters Rehab|publisher=[[CBS News]]|date=February 26, 2001|accessdate=November 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was filming ''[[Serving Sara]]'' in Texas when he suffered severe stomach pains, and flew to Los Angeles to check into [[Marina del Rey]]'s [[Centinela Freeman Regional Medical Center, Memorial Campus|Daniel Freeman Hospital]].

Perry is a fan of the ''[[Fallout (series)|Fallout]]'' video game series. On a 2009 episode of ''[[The Ellen DeGeneres Show]]'', he gave DeGeneres a copy of ''[[Fallout 3]]''. This prompted game studio [[Bethesda Softworks|Bethesda]] to cast him in the next installment of the series, ''[[Fallout: New Vegas]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Andrew Yoon |url=https://www.engadget.com/2010/08/14/how-ellen-degeneres-got-matthew-perry-his-role-in-fallout-new-v |title=How Ellen DeGeneres got Matthew Perry his role in Fallout: New Vegas |website=Engadget.com |date=August 14, 2010 |accessdate=August 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, as a celebrity spokesperson for the [[National Association of Drug Court Professionals]], Perry went to [[Capitol Hill]] to lobby members of Congress in support of funding for [[Drug courts in the United States|drug courts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.allrise.org/learn/nadcp-news-events/nadcp-news/nadcp-takes-center-stage-capitol-hill |title=Matthew Perry joins NADCP to ensure $86 million for Drug Courts and Veterans Treatment Courts|publisher=National Association of Drug Court Professionals |date=October 26, 2011 |accessdate=September 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perry received a Champion of Recovery award in May 2013 from the White House [[Office of National Drug Control Policy]] for opening Perry House, a sober living home situated in his former mansion in [[Malibu, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/entertainment/2013/05/matthew-perry-says-i-dont-think-so-to-friends-reunion|title=Matthew Perry Says 'I Don't Think So' to 'Friends' Reunion|publisher=[[ABC News]]|date=May 30, 2013|accessdate=September 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2018, Perry had abdominal surgery to repair a [[gastrointestinal perforation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-45111752|title=Matthew Perry on the mend after abdominal surgery|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=August 8, 2018|accessdate=August 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
