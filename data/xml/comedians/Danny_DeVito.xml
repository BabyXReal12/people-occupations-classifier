DeVito was raised as a Catholic and attended [[Oratory Preparatory School]], a boarding school in [[Summit, New Jersey]], graduating in 1962.

In his early theater days, he performed with the Colonnades Theater Lab, at the [[Eugene O'Neill Theater Center]] in [[Waterford, Connecticut]], and, along with his future wife, [[Rhea Perlman]], appeared in plays produced by the [[Westbeth Playwrights Feminist Collective]].

==Career==

===Film acting===
[[File:Danny DeVito by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|right|upright|DeVito at the [[San Diego Comic-Con International]] in July 2010]]
DeVito played Martini in the 1975 film ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (film)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]]'', reprising his role from the 1971 [[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (play)|off-Broadway play]] of the same title. He gained fame in 1978 playing Louie De Palma, the short but domineering dispatcher for the fictional Sunshine Cab Company, on the hit TV show ''[[Taxi (TV series)|Taxi]]''. After ''Taxi'' ended, DeVito began a successful film career, starting with roles in 1983's ''[[Terms of Endearment]]'', as the comic rogue in the romantic adventure ''[[Romancing the Stone]]'', starring [[Michael Douglas]] and [[Kathleen Turner]], and its 1985 sequel, ''[[The Jewel of the Nile]]''. In 1986, DeVito starred in ''[[Ruthless People]]'' with [[Bette Midler]] and [[Judge Reinhold]], and in 1987, he made his feature-directing debut with the [[dark comedy]] ''[[Throw Momma from the Train]]'', in which he starred with [[Billy Crystal]] and [[Anne Ramsey]]. Two years later, DeVito reunited with Douglas and Turner in ''[[War of the Roses (film)|The War of the Roses]]'', which he directed and in which he co-starred.

DeVito's work during this time includes ''[[Other People's Money]]'' with [[Gregory Peck]], director [[Barry Levinson]]'s ''[[Tin Men]]'' as a competitive rival salesman to [[Richard Dreyfuss]]' character, two co-starring vehicles with [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] (the comedies ''[[Twins (1988 film)|Twins]]'' and ''[[Junior (1994 film)|Junior]]''), and playing [[Penguin (comics)|The Penguin]] as a deformed sociopath in director Tim Burton's ''[[Batman Returns]]'' (1992) as well in the 1996 film adaptation ''[[Matilda (1996 film)|Matilda]]'' in which he played the villainous car dealer and Matilda's father Harry Wormwood.

Although generally a comic actor, DeVito expanded into dramatic roles with ''[[The Rainmaker (1997 film)|The Rainmaker]]'' (1997), ''[[Hoffa]]'' (1992), which he directed and in which he co-starred with [[Jack Nicholson]], ''[[Jack the Bear]]'' (1993), ''[[L.A. Confidential (film)|L.A. Confidential]]'', ''[[The Big Kahuna (film)|The Big Kahuna]]'', and ''[[Heist (film)|Heist]]'' ([[2001 in film|2001]]), as a [[gangster]] nemesis of Joe Moore ([[Gene Hackman]]).

DeVito has an interest in documentaries: In 2006, he began a partnership with [[Morgan Freeman]]'s company [[ClickStar]], on which he hosts a documentary channel called Jersey Docs. He was also interviewed in the documentary ''[[Revenge of the Electric Car]]'', about his interest in and ownership of [[electric vehicle]]s.

===Theatre===
In April 2012, DeVito made his [[West End theatre|West End]] acting debut in a revival of the [[Neil Simon]] play ''[[The Sunshine Boys]]'' as Willie Clark - alongside [[Richard Griffiths]].&lt;ref name=Esquire /&gt; The play previewed at the [[Savoy Theatre]] in London from 27 April 2012, opened on 17 May and played a limited 12-week season until 28 July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Sunshine Boys - Reviews|url=http://www.whatsonstage.com/west-end-theatre/reviews/05-2012/the-sunshine-boys_4231.html|publisher=What's On Stage|accessdate=25 April 2014|date=18 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DeVito made his [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] debut in a [[Roundabout Theatre Company]] revival of the [[Arthur Miller]] play ''[[The Price (play)|The Price]]'' as Gregory Solomon, for which he was nominated for a [[Tony Award]]. The production began preview performances at the [[American Airlines Theatre]] on February 16, 2017 and opened on March 16 for a limited run through May 7.

===Producing===
DeVito has become a major film and television producer. Through Jersey Films, he has produced many films, including ''[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]'', ''[[Get Shorty (film)|Get Shorty]]'', ''[[Erin Brockovich (film)|Erin Brockovich]]'' (for which he received an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture), ''[[Gattaca]]'', and ''[[Garden State (film)|Garden State]]''. In 1999, DeVito produced and co-starred in ''[[Man on the Moon (film)|Man on the Moon]]'', a film about the unusual life of his former ''Taxi'' co-star, [[Andy Kaufman]], who was played in the film by [[Jim Carrey]]. DeVito also produced the Comedy Central series ''[[Reno 911!]]'', as well as the film spin-off ''[[Reno 911!: Miami]]''.{{cn|date=June 2018}}
