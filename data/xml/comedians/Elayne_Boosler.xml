==Early life==

PublicAffairs, 2008; {{ISBN|0786724927}}&lt;/ref&gt; and raised in [[Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn]].

==Career==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=February 2018}}

===Early work===
After a job as a singer/dancer in touring companies and many unsuccessful waitressing jobs, Boosler worked as doorman at The [[Improvisation]] comedy club in [[New York City]] for two and a half years.

While working there, she met comedian [[Andy Kaufman]], a regular at the club, who convinced her she should do [[standup comedy]]. They lived together in [[Greenwich Village]] for three years and remained close friends until Kaufman's death. For her "comedy education" Boosler credits Kaufman as well as her other peers at the time, which included [[Freddie Prinze]], [[Jay Leno]], [[Larry David]], [[Richard Lewis (comedian)|Richard Lewis]], [[Richard Belzer]], [[Jimmie Walker]], and Ed Bluestone.

===Cable shows===
In 1986, Boosler became the first female to get her own one-hour comedy special on cable when [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] aired ''Party of One''. Having no credit cards or borrowing power, Boosler saved her money to produce the special herself when cable executives told her that they did not believe people would tune in to see a female do an hour of comedy. She successfully toured for 50&amp;nbsp;weeks a year performing a two-hour comedy show.

Up to 2011, Boosler has done seven cable specials. Her one-hour standup comedy concert specials for Showtime include ''Party of One'', ''Broadway Baby'', ''Top Tomata'' (broadcast live from [[Omaha]] and voted Best Comedy Special of the Year by readers of ''Cable Guide'' magazine), and ''Live Nude Girls''. Her New Year's Eve comedy-variety special, ''Elayne Boosler's Midnight Hour'', was a 90-minute special from a Town Hall in New York and telecast live on Showtime. She wrote, directed, and acted in two half-hour movies for [[Cinemax]]: ''Comedy From Here'' (a drama) and ''The Call''.

Boosler hosted the short-lived game show ''[[Balderdash (game show)|Balderdash]]'' on [[PAX Network|PAX]] (now [[ION Television]]). Other television guest-hosting duties include ''A.M. San Francisco'', ''[[Late Show with David Letterman|The Late Show]]'', ''[[The Midnight Special (TV series)|The Midnight Special]]'', ''[[Comic Strip Live]]'', ''[[Friday Night Videos]]'', ''The Gossip Show'' on [[E!]], and many specials. She has contributed field pieces to many shows, including ''[[The Today Show]]'', ''[[Not Necessarily the News]]'', and ''[[Donny &amp; Marie (1976 TV series)|Donny and Marie]]''.

In the early days of cable, Boosler wrote and hosted the [[Cable ACE Awards]]. Her specials were nominated every year they premiered. She has also written and hosted awards shows for the [[Writer's Guild of America]] (both west and east), for New York Women in Film and Television twice, for the Pollstar Awards three times, the [[Daytime Emmys]], the "Casting Director's Guild," and many others.

===Cable and network television appearances===
She has guest-starred as an actress on ''[[Night Court]]'', ''[[The Cosby Show]]'', ''[[Living Single]]'', ''[[Dear John (U.S. TV series)|Dear John]]'', ''Sisters'', and ''[[Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist]]'' and done cartoon [[voiceover]]s. She guested on [[Bill Maher]]'s ''[[Politically Incorrect]]'' 32 times. The year before Andy Kaufman's death, she and Kaufman wrote his last special together, ''Soundstage: Andy Kaufman'', where she and Kaufman performed an interview with Kaufman seated at a desk that towered over her by eight feet. Boosler appeared on [[HBO]]'s "[[Comic Relief]]" for six years.

She appeared on ABC's ''A Festival at Ford's Theater'', entertaining President [[Bill Clinton]] and Congress. Her specials ran for years on the [[BBC]], and she has performed twice at the [[London Palladium]] once for a live Easter special and once at the Command Performance for the Queen. She was the first comedian chosen by President Clinton to perform at the [[White House]] Press Correspondents' dinner during his first year in office.

==Political activism==
Boosler is active in [[liberal politics]]. On July 11, 2003, she moderated a Democratic presidential candidates debate on [[C-Span]] hosted by the [[National Organization for Women]]. She is also a frequent contributor to ''[[The Huffington Post]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/elayne-boosler Elayne Boosler index], HuffingtonPost.com; accessed January 28, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

She works on behalf of women's [[reproductive freedom]] and has been honored by the '''Women's Reproductive Rights Assistance Project'''. She was a frequent guest during election cycles on "[[Larry King Live]]" and after-debate roundtables on CNN and local news channels. She appeared frequently on "CNN and Company" For three years she was the permanent guest host on ''[[The Stephanie Miller Show]]'', a progressive [[talk radio|radio talk show]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Animal rescue and advocacy===
Boosler began volunteering at [[Boxer (dog)|Boxer Rescue of Los Angeles]] in 1995. She eventually joined its Board of Directors and raised the down payment needed for them to buy a rescue kennel. She moved on and founded, in 2001, her own animal rescue and advocacy organization, '''(Elayne Boosler's) Tails of Joy''', a nonprofit organization that benefits the smallest, neediest rescue organizations and individual cases nationwide.
