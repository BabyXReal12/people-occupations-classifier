[[File:Mister Ed main cast 2.JPG|thumb|[[Connie Hines]] and Alan Young in TV's ''[[Mister Ed]]'' ]]
'''Alan Young''' (born '''Angus Young'''; November 19, 1919&amp;nbsp;– May 19, 2016) was a [[British Americans|British&amp;ndash;American]] actor, voice actor, comedian and radio and television host/personality who ''[[TV Guide]]'' called "The [[Charlie Chaplin]] of Television". He was best known for his role as naive Wilbur Post in the television comedy series ''[[Mister Ed]]'' (1961–1966). Young was also the voice of Disney's [[Scrooge McDuck]] for over thirty years, first in the [[Academy Award]]-nominated short film ''[[Mickey's Christmas Carol]]'' (1983) and in various other films, TV series and video games until his death. During the 1940s and 1950s, he starred in his own variety/comedy sketch shows ''[[The Alan Young Show]]'' on radio and television, the latter gaining him two [[Primetime Emmy Award|Emmy Awards]] in 1951. He also appeared in a number of feature films, starting from 1946, including the 1960 film ''[[The Time Machine (1960 film)|The Time Machine]]'' and from the 1980s gaining a new generation of viewers appearing in numerous [[Walt Disney Productions]] films as both an actor and voice actor.

==Early life==
Young was born as Angus Young on November 19, 1919, in [[North Shields]], [[Northumberland]], England, to [[Scottish people|Scottish]] parents. (In his later years he claimed he had been born in 1924.) His father was a mine worker and a tap dancer, and his mother was a singer. The family moved to [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]], when Young was a toddler and to [[West Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]], when he was six years old. Young came to love radio when bedridden as a child because of severe [[asthma]].&lt;ref name=barnes&gt;{{cite news |last1=Barnes |first1=Mike |last2=Byrnes |first2=Duane |date=May 20, 2016 |title=Alan Young, Two-Legged Star of 'Mister Ed,' Dies at 96 |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/alan-young-dead-mister-ed-816846 |work=The Hollywood Reporter |location= |access-date=May 20, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=shapiro&gt;{{cite news |last=Shapiro |first=T.

By the time he was in high school, Young had his own comedy radio series on the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] network, but he left it during the [[Second World War]] to serve in the [[Royal Canadian Navy]].&lt;ref name=barnes /&gt;&lt;ref name=ap&gt;{{cite news |last=Elbur |first=Lynn |date=May 20, 2016 |title=Alan Young, Star of 1960s sitcom 'Mr. Ed,' Dies at 96|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/7dc308dd967d4703aeffd12143b647b4/alan-young-star-1960s-sitcom-mr-ed-dies-96 |work=Associated Press |location= |access-date=May 20, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stevens"&gt;{{cite book |last= Stevens |first= Christopher |title= Born Brilliant: The Life Of Kenneth Williams |publisher= John Murray |year= 2010 |isbn = 1-84854-195-3 |page=368}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later resigned his Navy commission after learning he would be spending his time writing for a Navy show, and he attempted to join the [[Canadian Army]]. According to some sources, the Army rejected him due to his childhood asthma.&lt;ref name=dunham&gt;{{cite news |last=Dunham |first=Will |date=May 20, 2016 |title=Actor Alan Young, Human Star of Horse Sitcom 'Mister Ed,' Dies at 96 |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-people-alanyoung-idUSKCN0YB2SJ |work=Reuters |location= |access-date=May 20, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
After leaving the service, Young moved to [[Toronto]] and resumed his Canadian radio career, where he was discovered by an American agent who brought him to [[New York City|New York]] in 1944 to appear on American radio.&lt;ref name=barnes /&gt; Young's first American radio appearances were on the ''Philco Radio Hall of Fame''. This led to his own show, ''[[The Alan Young Show]]'', [[National Broadcasting Company|NBC]]'s summer replacement for the series ''[[Eddie Cantor|The Eddie Cantor Show]]''.&lt;ref name=barnes /&gt; He switched to [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] two years later, then returned to NBC.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=EwtRbXNca0oC&amp;pg=PA20 On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio]  John Dunning; Oxford University Press, pp20&amp;ndash;21&lt;/ref&gt;

Young's film debut was in ''[[Margie (film)|Margie]]'' (1946), and he was featured in ''[[Chicken Every Sunday]]'' (1949).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Thomas|first=Bob|title=Comic Alan Young Critical of TV|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WW1QAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=VhAEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5217,4930447&amp;dq=alan-young&amp;hl=en|newspaper=The Milwaukee Sentinel|date=June 10, 1959}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950, the television version of ''The Alan Young Show'' began. By 1951, the series received not only praise, but also several [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s, including Best Actor and Most Outstanding Personality for Young.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nominations Search|url=http://www.emmys.com/awards/nominations/award-search?search_api_views_fulltext=%22alan+young%22&amp;submit=Search&amp;field_celebrity_details_field_display_name=&amp;field_show_details_field_nominee_show_nr_title=&amp;field_show_details_field_network=All&amp;field_show_details_field_production_company=All&amp;field_nominations_year=1949-01-01+00%3A00%3A00&amp;field_nominations_year_1=2016-01-01+00%3A00%3A00&amp;field_award_category=All|publisher=[[Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences]]|accessdate=25 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After its cancellation, Young continued to act in films, among which ''[[Androcles and the Lion (film)|Androcles and the Lion]]'' (1952) and ''[[Gentlemen Marry Brunettes]]'' (1955), and two [[George Pal]] films, ''[[Tom Thumb (film)|Tom Thumb]]'' (1958) and ''[[The Time Machine (1960 film)|The Time Machine]]'' (1960). He appeared in the NBC espionage drama ''[[Five Fingers (TV series)|Five Fingers]]'' ("Thin Ice", 1959), starring [[David Hedison]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=37SSBAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover  There's No Business Like Show Business...Was]  Alan Young; BearManor Media, Jul 5, 2006, multiple mentions&lt;/ref&gt;

Young was best known, however, for ''[[Mister Ed]]'' (1961–66), a [[Columbia Broadcasting System|CBS]] television show, in which he starred as Wilbur Post, the owner of Mr. Ed, a talking horse who would not talk to anyone but him, thus causing comic situations for Wilbur Post, with his wife, neighbors, and acquaintances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2202&amp;dat=19610318&amp;id=HD4mAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=4v4FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2227,2840363|work=The Gettysburg Times|date=March 18, 1961|title=Alan Young In ''Mister Ed''|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also starred as Stanley Beamish in the unaired 1966 pilot episode of ''[[Mr. Terrific (TV series)|Mr. Terrific]]'', but apparently declined to appear in the broadcast series in 1967 that followed. In the late 1960s, he retired from acting for several years. During that time, he founded a broadcast division for the [[Christian Science]] Church.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=4tcxAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22alan+young%22+%22christian+science%22+broadcast&amp;dq=%22alan+young%22+%22christian+science%22+broadcast&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj7pZq5yvXMAhVGLlIKHSYICkwQ6AEIIjAB  TV Guide 1974]  page 36 "Well, he's come back to Hollywood after spending the past six years as a Christian Science lecturer in Boston and other parts of the country. "I set up a film and broadcasting department for the mother church in Boston," Young said"&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1970s, Young became active in voice acting. After 1974, he voiced [[Scrooge McDuck]] in numerous [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] films and in the popular series ''[[DuckTales]]'' (1987-1990). In ''[[Mickey's Christmas Carol]]'', he portrayed the character's miserly [[Ebenezer Scrooge|namesake]]. He also played Scrooge in video games such as the ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' series, ''[[DuckTales: Remastered]]'' in 2013, and the ''[[Mickey Mouse (TV series)|Mickey Mouse]]'' cartoon "Goofy's First Love" released in 2015. Apart from Scrooge McDuck, his other prominent roles were [[Farmer Smurf]] on ''[[The Smurfs (TV series)|The Smurfs]]'', Haggis McHaggis on ''[[The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show]]'', 7-Zark-7, Keyop in ''[[Battle of the Planets]]'', and Hiram Flaversham in ''[[The Great Mouse Detective]]''. He also guest starred on ''[[The Love Boat]]'', ''[[The Incredible Hulk (1982 TV series)|The Incredible Hulk]]'', ''[[The New Scooby and Scrappy-Doo Show]]'', and ''[[Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://voicechasers.com/database/showprod.php?prodid=160|title=Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends (1981, Animated Series) Voice Cast|website=Voice Chasers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Young later starred in the sitcom ''[[Coming of Age (1988 TV series)|Coming of Age]]'' for two seasons from 1988-89. In 1991, Alan Young returned to the stage, starring as Cap'n Andy Hawkes in the [[California Musical Theatre]]'s adaptation of ''[[Show Boat]]''. He had been called for the role after [[Van Johnson]], who was initially cast in the part, was hospitalised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Sylvie Drake|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-09-16/entertainment/ca-1756_1_show-boat-stage|date=September 16, 1991|title=Stage: 'Show Boat' Afloat Without Its Star|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had also appeared in the plays ''[[A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum]]'' and ''The Girl With the Freudian Slip''. In 1993, he recreated his role as Filby for the mini-sequel to [[George Pal]]'s ''The Time Machine'', reuniting him with [[Rod Taylor]], who had played George, the Time Traveller. It was called ''[[Time Machine: The Journey Back]]'', directed by Clyde Lucas. In 1994, Young co-starred in the [[Eddie Murphy]] film ''[[Beverly Hills Cop III]]''. He played the role of Uncle Dave Thornton, the [[Walt Disney]]-esque founder of the fictional California theme park Wonderworld, and in that same year, Young played the role of Charlie in the television film, ''Hart to Hart: Home Is Where the Hart Is''.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

After 1994, he played at least eight characters, including antique dealer Jack Allen on the radio drama ''[[Adventures in Odyssey]]''. In 1997, he did the voice of [[Haggis McMutton]] in the PC game ''[[The Curse of Monkey Island]]''. His later guest roles in animated series included ''[[Megas XLR]]'', ''[[Static Shock]]'', ''[[House of Mouse]]'', ''[[The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show]]'', ''[[Duckman]]'', ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' and ''[[TaleSpin]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/Alan-Young/ Alan Young's voiceography].

Wells]]'s [[The Time Machine|original novel]] for 7th Voyage Productions, Inc. Young's television guest roles include ''[[Gibbsville (TV series)|Gibbsville]]'', ''[[The Love Boat]]'', ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'', ''[[St. Elsewhere]]'', ''[[Coach (TV series)|Coach]]'', ''[[Party of Five]]'', ''[[The Wayans Bros.]]'', ''[[USA High]]'', ''[[Hang Time (TV series)|Hang Time]]'', ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'', ''[[Maybe It's Me (TV series)|Maybe It's Me]]'', and ''[[Sabrina, the Teenage Witch (1996 TV series)|Sabrina, the Teenage Witch]]'' ("Sweet Charity", 1997) in which he played Zelda's love interest.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}
