'''Arthur Steven "Artie" Lange Jr.''' (born October 11, 1967) is an American comedian, actor, author, and radio and podcast host, best known for his tenures on ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'' and the sketch comedy series ''[[Mad TV]]''. Born and raised in [[New Jersey]], Lange first worked as a [[longshoreman]] and taxi driver to help support his family following the death of his [[quadriplegic]] father. In 1987, he made his debut as a stand up comic and took up the profession full-time in the early 1990s, performing in clubs and improv shows in and around [[New York City]].

In 1995, Lange moved to [[Los Angeles]] to star in the [[Mad TV (season 1)|first season]] of ''Mad TV''. His arrest for [[cocaine]] possession during the second season led to his departure and subsequent rehabilitation. In 1997, [[Norm Macdonald]] chose Lange to co-star in his comedy film ''[[Dirty Work (1998 film)|Dirty Work]]'' (1998), which secured Lange several film and television roles including Macdonald's sitcom, ''[[The Norm Show]]''. In 2001, Lange returned to New Jersey and became a member of ''The Howard Stern Show'' until December 2009. He pursued various projects during this time; he released two comedy albums, co-wrote, produced, and starred in his feature film, ''[[Artie Lange's Beer League]]'' (2006), and released his first book, ''[[Too Fat to Fish]]'' (2008), which entered [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]] at number one.

In 2011, Lange completed rehabilitation and resumed his career. He co-hosted ''[[The Nick &amp; Artie Show]]'' with [[Nick Di Paolo]] until Di Paolo's departure in 2013; the show was renamed ''[[The Artie Lange Show]]'' and lasted until 2014. During this time, Lange released his second book, ''[[Crash and Burn (book)|Crash and Burn]]'' (2013). He hosted the podcast ''The Artie Quitter Podcast'' from 2015 to 2017, and his third book, ''Wanna Bet?'', is set for release in 2018. Lange was co-host of ''The Artie and Anthony Show'' with [[Anthony Cumia]] in 2017 and 2018 and continues to perform stand-up and act, most recently in the [[HBO]] series ''[[Crashing (U.S. TV series)|Crashing]]''.

== Early life ==
Lange was born on October 11, 1967 in [[Livingston, New Jersey]],{{sfn|Lange|Bozza|2008|pp=1–5}} and was raised in [[Union Township, Union County, New Jersey|Union Township]], [[Union County, New Jersey|Union County]]. His mother, Judy (née Caprio), of [[Italians|Italian]] descent, was a housewife, while his father, Arthur Lange Sr., of [[Germans|German]] and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] descent, was a general contractor who installed television antennas.&lt;ref name=npr2007&gt;{{cite episode|title=Artie Lange, in 'League' With the Forces of Comedy|series=[[Fresh Air]]|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=13924166|credits=[[Terry Gross]]|network=[[NPR]]|airdate=September 14, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; His sister Stacey is a fashion designer.&lt;ref name=nypost2010&gt;{{cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2010/01/08/artie-langes-chilling-words-pre-suicide-attempt-i-have-so-much-to-live-for/|title=Artie Lange's chilling words pre-suicide attempt: 'I have so much to live for'|date=January 8, 2010|accessdate=May 17, 2015|work=The New York Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two weeks after Lange's birth, his father went on trial for keeping $200,000 in counterfeit money for a [[loan shark]], but was spared jail time out of the court's sympathy for his young son.{{sfn|Lange|Bozza|2008|pp=1–5}}&lt;ref name=rollingstone2009/&gt; In August 2003, Lange found out he is approximately twenty-five per cent [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indian]] after submitting a sample of his [[DNA]] for [[DNA testing|testing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|series=The Howard Stern Show|network=Infinity Broadcasting|station=WXRK-FM|location=New York City|date=August 21, 2003|quote='''Howard Stern''': It is Artie ... He is twenty-five percent Native American.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lange attended [[Union High School (New Jersey)|Union High School]], during which he played baseball and became an all-county third baseman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A41836-2005Apr10.html|title=THECHAT|work=The Washington Post|last=Steinberg|first=David|date=April 11, 2005|accessdate=July 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His poor grades required him to attend [[summer school]] in order to graduate.&lt;ref name=interrobang2016/&gt; In August 1985, Lange was arrested for attempted bank robbery. He claimed he was trying to flirt with the teller by passing her a note that said he was armed and demanded $50,000. The teller took it seriously, triggering a silent alarm. His charge was reduced to disorderly conduct which required Lange to pay $500 in court fees and complete 25 hours of community service in March 1986.&lt;ref name=npr2008/&gt;{{sfn|Lange|Bozza|2008|pp=50–59}} As part of his probation, Lange attended the [[Connecticut School of Broadcasting]] from March to June 1987.

In 1985, Lange gained admission to [[Seton Hall University]] in [[South Orange, New Jersey]] using a connection his uncle had with an employee of the admissions department. In one early assignment, he received an A grade for a presentation he made, telling stories about his friends and family to the class. "It was the first time I got a bunch of laughs in front of a crowd of total strangers and it felt amazing to get that reaction from people."&lt;ref name=npr2007/&gt; After four weeks, Lange became bored "to death" and began to think of ways to quit.{{sfn|Lange|Bozza|2008|pp=1–5}} On October 18, in a sudden turn of events, his father fell off a ladder while installing an antenna and broke his back, becoming [[quadriplegic]].{{sfn|Lange|Bozza|2008|pp=1–5}}&lt;ref name="other"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hudsonreporter.com/view/full_story/2416675/article-The-other-side-of-laughter-Stern-show-regular--comedian-Artie-Lange-discusses-radio--new-book?|title=The other side of laughter|work=The Hudson Reporter|last=Schwaeble|first= Diana|date=July 31, 2008|accessdate=November 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Lange|Bozza|2008|p=36}} Money soon became an issue in the family; Lange's mother took up a secretarial job and Lange spent a short time installing antennas himself.&lt;ref name=npr2007/&gt; Lange recalled the situation: "We took out a second mortgage. [[Medicaid]] paid for a nurse eight hours a day. When my mother got back from being a secretary all day, she had to take care of him. Every night, she set her alarm clock to turn him so he wouldn't get bedsores."&lt;ref name="other"/&gt; In 1987, the family contacted celebrities asking them to donate items for auction. [[Howard Stern]], the only one to respond, sent them an autographed jacket and said on the air, "Does this guy think that if he puts the jacket on he's going to walk again?", which Lange and his father found funny.&lt;ref name="other"/&gt; Lange's father died from complications of an infection in 1990,{{sfn|Lange|Bozza|2008|pp=1–5}}&lt;ref name=npr2008&gt;{{cite episode|title=Artie Lange Tells All in 'Too Fat to Fish'|series=[[Fresh Air]]|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=96849879|credits=[[Terry Gross]]|network=[[NPR]]|airdate=November 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; though he believes one of his father's "crazy friends" may have helped him to commit suicide.&lt;ref name=nypost2010/&gt;

== Career ==

=== 1987–1995: Early career ===

He recalled, "I bombed for five minutes. Everyone thinks that they can do better. I was unprepared, I mumbled, and I forgot stuff. But I'm proud that I did it."&lt;ref name=otherside2/&gt; Lange would not attempt stand-up again for another four years.&lt;ref name=npr2007/&gt; In 1988, Lange took acting classes for three weeks from [[Sandy Dennis]] at [[HB Studio]] in New Jersey; he quit after he could no longer afford them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Joey Diaz interview|series=The Artie Lange Show|date=2013|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3Z7UAH44xM|quote=YouTube title: The Artie Lange Show - Joey Diaz (in-studio) Part 2|network=DirecTV|last=Lange (host)|first=Artie}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1991, Lange supported his family by taking up work as a [[Stevedore|longshoreman]] at [[Port Newark]], loading ships at its orange juice pier. In that year alone, Lange earned around $60,000.&lt;ref name=rollingstone2009/&gt;{{sfn|Lange|Bozza|2008|p=112}}

In September 1992, Lange quit his longshoreman job to focus on a comedy career,{{sfn|Lange|Bozza|2008|p=112}} giving himself one year to make it at stand-up.&lt;ref name=observer2001&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-81232313.html|title=Stern and Lange: Comedian Gets Dream Job With Howard|first=Jason|last=Gray|newspaper=The New York Observer|date=December 3, 2001|accessdate=February 21, 2017|via=[[Highbeam Research]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his search for work, his regular form of employment was driving a taxi in New York City; the flexibility of his taxi job allowed him to perform sets at the clubs and resume work afterwards.{{sfn|Lange|Bozza|2008|p=123}}{{sfn|Lange|Bozza|2008|p=125}} Lange's first paid gig as a stand-up followed at the [[United States Merchant Marine Academy]] in [[Kings Point, New York]] for a payment of $30.&lt;ref name=podcast283&gt;{{cite podcast|last=Lange|first=Artie|title=The Artie Quitter Podcast: Episode 283|url=http://www.artiequitter.com/|publisher=Publisher|date=August 3, 2016|time=49:36|access-date=August 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then became a paid regular for the first time in 1992 at Stand Up NY in Manhattan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|user=ArtieQuitter|author=Artie Lange|number=653100575207329792|date=October 11, 2015|title=Me at a friends apartment after a night of cocaine abuse NYC 1992 I passed at 1st Comedy Club same night Stand Up NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by [[Comic Strip Live]], where he would perform a 20-minute set from Tuesday to Saturday nights.&lt;ref name=podcast283-2&gt;{{cite podcast|last=Lange|first=Artie|title=The Artie Quitter Podcast: Episode 283|url=http://www.artiequitter.com/|publisher=Publisher|date=August 3, 2016|time=48:31|access-date=August 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Lange|Bozza|2008|p=125}} Within a year of starting, Lange landed a role in a dinner theater play, touring restaurants and catering halls across New Jersey.{{sfn|Lange|Bozza|2008|pp=117–118}} He then co-formed an [[improv troupe]] called Live on Tape which became a hit, selling out [[Caroline's on Broadway]] numerous times.{{sfn|Lange|Bozza|2008|pp=117–118}} The success of these shows led to a contract with the [[William Morris Agency]] where Lange met Peter Principato, his manager for the next ten years. Lange took up extra work with roles in commercials which were a "big step up",{{sfn|Lange|Bozza|2008|pp=117–118}} including a voiceover for [[Foot Locker]], which entitled him to become a member of [[American Federation of Television and Radio Artists|AFTRA]].&lt;ref name=podcast283-3&gt;{{cite podcast|last=Lange|first=Artie|title=The Artie Quitter Podcast: Episode 283|url=http://www.artiequitter.com/|publisher=Publisher|date=August 3, 2016|time=52:26|access-date=August 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, Lange developed an addiction to [[cocaine]] and alcohol.{{sfn|Lange|Bozza|2008|p=136}}

=== 1995–1997: ''Mad TV'' ===
At twenty-seven, Lange was chosen as one of the eight cast members selected to star in the sketch comedy series ''[[Mad TV]]'', from the eight thousand that were screened. He flew to [[Los Angeles]] in May 1995 to shoot the television pilot which was picked up by the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] network.{{sfn|Lange|Bozza|2008|p=138}} Lange moved to Los Angeles two months later to film the [[Mad TV (season 1)|first season]]{{sfn|Lange|Bozza|2008|p=137}} with a salary of $7,500 per episode plus "a big signing bonus".{{sfn|Lange|Bozza|2008|p=138}} Lange's cocaine abuse worsened during this time, doing it "like it was going out of style".{{sfn|Lange|Bozza|2008|p=138}} In November 1995, after nine episodes had been shot,{{sfn|Lange|Bozza|2008|p=157}} he attempted suicide after he ran out of cocaine, drank whiskey and "a bunch of pills", and wrote a suicide note to his mother and sister. He claimed, "I was 100 percent serious about dying".&lt;ref name=rollingstone2009/&gt; He was found by his ''Mad TV'' co-stars and taken to intensive care.{{sfn|Lange|Bozza|2008|p=162}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laughspin.com/artie-lange-confirms-his-return-to-radio-new-show-debuts-sept-12/|title=Artie Lange confirms return to radio, opens up about his recovery|publisher=LaughSpin|date=July 21, 2011|accessdate=May 21, 2015|first=Dylan P.|last=Gadino}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lange returned to New Jersey to complete a rehabilitation and counselling program.{{sfn|Lange|Bozza|2008|p=164}} At its conclusion, he wrote a new forty-five minute stand up set that he felt "really proud of", and used his ''Mad TV'' fame to headline spots in comedy clubs around New York City,{{sfn|Lange|Bozza|2008|p=172}} supported by further voiceover work for commercials.{{sfn|Lange|Bozza|2008|p=173}}

In January 1996, Lange returned to Los Angeles to film the remaining episodes of the first season. [[Quincy Jones]], the show's producer, supported Lange during rehab and sent him over on his private jet.{{sfn|Lange|Bozza|2008|p=165}} Lange returned to form in his work, ranking his performance in these episodes as "the best I've ever done in sketch comedy", including the creation of his hit character, White Mama.{{sfn|Lange|Bozza|2008|p=166}} In the summer of 1996, Lange secured his first major acting role for an independent film titled ''Puppet'', starring [[Rebecca Gayheart]] and [[Fred Weller]]. He wrote, "To this day I have never seen it because I don't think it's possible to purchase a copy of it anywhere&amp;nbsp;... it was screened in a theater at least once, because my manager went to see it".{{sfn|Lange|Bozza|2008|p=172}}

Filming for the [[Mad TV (season 2)|second season]] of ''Mad TV'' began in August 1996.{{sfn|Lange|Bozza|2008|p=171}} Two months later, Lange ended his sobriety and returned to doing cocaine.{{sfn|Lange|Bozza|2008|p=173}} His time on the show ended in November 1996 when his agent and the show's cast and crew attempted an [[Intervention (counseling)|intervention]]. The incident began when Lange lost a $15,000 bet on the [[Mike Tyson vs. Evander Holyfield]] boxing match and turned up to rehearsals "coked up".&lt;ref name=latimes2006/&gt; Lange fled the set, running through streets with his co-workers chasing him. It ended in the parking lot of a supermarket where Lange was arrested and served a short time in [[Men's Central Jail|Los Angeles County Jail]].{{sfn|Lange|Bozza|2008|p=195}} The case was never tried in court.&lt;ref name=latimes2006&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/jul/16/entertainment/ca-vegas16|title=Artie Lange &amp; Vegas: A potent mix|first=Richard|last=Abowitz|date=July 16, 2006|work=The Los Angeles Times|accessdate=May 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in jail, Lange received a voice mail from [[Cameron Crowe]] who informed him that his scene with [[Tom Cruise]] and [[Kelly Preston]] for ''[[Jerry Maguire]]'' had been cut.{{sfn|Lange|Bozza|2008|p=203}}

After his jail term, Lange returned to New Jersey in January 1997 and spent a short time in a [[psychiatric hospital]]. He described this time as the "most depressing period" of his life.{{sfn|Lange|Bozza|2008|p=212}} He returned home afterwards, and fell into a clinical depression. After the producers at ''Mad TV'' convinced Lange to complete formal rehabilitation, he spent two months at Honesty House in [[Stirling, New Jersey]].{{sfn|Lange|Bozza|2008|pp=214–215}} Lange's contract was not renewed for the show's [[Mad TV (season 3)|third season]],{{sfn|Lange|Bozza|2008|p=217}} but made special guest appearances on the [[Mad TV (season 5)|fifth]], [[Mad TV (season 10)|tenth]], and [[Mad TV (season 14)|fourteenth seasons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxflash.com/div.php/main/page?aID=1z4&amp;mo=5&amp;d=16|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090621172012/http://www.foxflash.com/div.php/main/page?aID=1z4&amp;mo=5&amp;d=16|archivedate=2009-06-21|publisher=Fox Flash|title=Fox Primetime Schedule}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1997–2001: ''Dirty Work'' and ''The Norm Show'' ===
[[File:Norm Macdonald.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Lange credits comedian and actor [[Norm Macdonald]] with helping continue his career.]]
In 1997, Lange left rehab and resumed stand up gigs in New York City. His depression improved soon after when he was invited to audition for two network television sitcoms, which boosted his confidence "astronomically".{{sfn|Lange|Bozza|2008|p=217}} During the negotiations phase, Lange was contacted by comedian and actor [[Norm Macdonald]] who asked him to audition for the second lead role in his comedy buddy film ''[[Dirty Work (1998 film)|Dirty Work]]'' (1998), directed by [[Bob Saget]].{{sfn|Lange|Bozza|2008|p=218}} Macdonald had not found a suitable actor for the part until he happened to tune into an episode of ''Mad TV'' for the first time, and saw a sketch that involved Lange delivering an out of character monologue which he found funny, and noted Lange "had a melancholy about him" that reminded Macdonald of comedian [[John Belushi]].{{sfn|Macdonald|2016}} Macdonald recalled Lange's first reading of the script was "perfect" and it landed him the role, but in order to shoot the film, [[MGM]] studios required Lange to obtain an approval report from his rehab facility in New Jersey. Lange settled the matter by paying the center $1,500 as a private donor.{{sfn|Lange|Bozza|2008|p=226}} He ended his cocaine use on June 14, 1997, saying he "got tired of it. I got to a point where this is killing me".&lt;ref name=nypost2010/&gt; Filming took place across two months in [[Toronto]]; to promote the film, Lange made his debut guest appearance on ''The Howard Stern Show'' with Macdonald on January 8, 1998. The pair returned once more that year, and twice more in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;''The Howard Stern Show'' broadcast for June 9, 1998 and March 22 and September 22, 1999. WXRK-FM New York City. Infinity Broadcasting.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lange credits Macdonald and Saget with rejuvenating his career when his exposure from ''Dirty Work'' led to several film and television offers. When filming wrapped, various heads of networks and production companies expressed an interest in potentially hiring Lange. After meeting with them, including [[Warren Littlefield]] of [[NBC]] and [[Peter Roth (executive)|Peter Roth]] of Fox, a bidding war occurred with offers from every major network. With help from William Morris Agency, Lange accepted a $750,000 development deal with Fox that originally stood at $250,000 in late 1997,{{sfn|Lange|Bozza|2008|p=237}} enabling him "to bail my mother out of every single financial debt she had."{{sfn|Lange|Bozza|2008|p=120}} None of Lange's ideas for a show were picked up, but he supported himself by working at comedy clubs around Los Angeles{{sfn|Lange|Bozza|2008|p=238}} and landed a role in a pilot television series that he co-wrote with Sam Cass in April 1998 which was re-written by request from the network. Its title was ''The King of New York'' which included [[Luis Guzmán]] in its cast. Lange felt the idea was ignored and suddenly pushed it through for shooting at the last minute, which affected its quality.{{sfn|Lange|Bozza|2008|p=240}} Weeks later, Lange accepted a second development deal, this time with NBC worth $350,000.{{sfn|Lange|Bozza|2008|p=241}} From 1999 to 2000, Lange secured roles in the feature films ''[[Mystery Men]]'', ''[[The Bachelor (1999 film)|The Bachelor]]'', ''[[The 4th Floor (1999 film)|The 4th Floor]]'',{{sfn|Lange|Bozza|2008|p=242}} and ''[[Lost &amp; Found (1999 film)|Lost &amp; Found]]''. He also toured as the opening act to Macdonald's stand-up shows.{{sfn|Lange|Bozza|2008|p=241}}

In 1999, Lange joined the cast of Macdonald's sitcom ''[[The Norm Show]]'' during its second season as Macdonald's half brother, Artie. Lange stayed with the show until its cancellation in 2001 after three seasons. He enjoyed a period of wealth during this time, being paid $35,000 per episode for a show with "ridiculously lame, easy jokes", liked working with his castmates (particularly MacDonald and [[Laurie Metcalf]], who would later portray his mother in ''[[Beer League]]'') and lived in a $4,000-a-month condo in [[Beverly Hills]]. "Even with that life", Lange added, "creatively I was empty inside".&lt;ref name=npr2008/&gt; During a 2014 interview with [[Marc Maron]], Lange said that this creative frustration drove him to perform more stand-up comedy and "came into his own as a comedian" by introducing more "dark," edgy material into his act.

=== 2001–2008: ''The Howard Stern Show'' and ''Artie Lange's Beer League'' ===
In March 2001, comedian and writer [[Jackie Martling]] left ''The Howard Stern Show''. Stern announced a "Win Jackie's Money" contest and had several comedians audition for the vacant seat by sitting in on some shows. Participants included Lange, [[Craig Gass]], [[Doug Stanhope]], [[Richard Jeni]], [[Jeff Ross]], [[Jim Florentine]], and Ron Zimmerman.&lt;ref name=nypost2001&gt;{{cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2001/10/08/stern-replaces-jokeman-jackie/|title=Stern Replaces Jokeman Jackie|last=Kaplan|first=Don|date=October 8, 2001|accessdate=October 29, 2009|work=The New York Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lange was introduced to the show in 1982 by his father, and since became a big fan.&lt;ref name="other"/&gt; He spoke about his invitation to take part in the contest: "There were a lot of great funny guys — guys that were funnier than me&amp;nbsp;... I remember saying to my manager, 'I am not the most talented guy in this group, but I guarantee that I'm the biggest fan'".&lt;ref name=otherside2/&gt; After ''The Norm Show'' ended in April 2001, Lange returned to New Jersey and sat in on several shows between May and October 2001.

=== 2008–2009: Various projects and ''Stern Show'' departure ===
In June 2008, Lange headlined a comedy tour he formed, named Operation Mirth, with the [[United Service Organizations]] to entertain American troops serving in [[Afghanistan]]. He was inspired to do so after watching ''[[Patriot Act: A Jeffrey Ross Home Movie]]'', a documentary about comedian [[Jeffrey Ross]]' own USO tour in [[Iraq]]. Lange picked comedians [[Jim Florentine]], [[Nick DiPaolo]], and [[Dave Attell]] to join him, with ''The Howard Stern Show's'' producer [[Gary Dell'Abate]] as the tour's [[master of ceremonies]].&lt;ref name=otherside2/&gt; Later in the year, Lange and Attell recorded dialogue for the video game ''[[Leisure Suit Larry: Box Office Bust]]'', released in 2009.

In August 2008, Lange entered rehab after he cancelled his appearance on the ''[[The Roast of Bob Saget|Comedy Central Roast of Bob Saget]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828035047/http://www.nypost.com/seven/08062008/gossip/pagesix/rehab_for_stern_sidekick_123164.htm |archivedate=August 28, 2008 |url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/08062008/gossip/pagesix/rehab_for_stern_sidekick_123164.htm |title=Rehab For Stern Sidekick |work=The New York Post |date=August 6, 2008 |accessdate=April 30, 2011 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; He had relapsed in heroin use in the previous seven weeks after he was offered it while drunk at a pool hall. [[Comedy Central]] were willing to cover the $65,000 in costs to send an ambulance for him to the airport and fly him to Los Angeles on a private jet with a doctor, but Lange declined&lt;ref name=rollingstone2009/&gt; and began treatment with a therapist recommended by comedian [[Richard Lewis (comedian)|Richard Lewis]], who contacted Lange to help.&lt;ref&gt;Lange; Bozza, "Greetings from Sunny Kandahar"&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Lange signed a deal with [[Spiegel &amp; Grau]] to write his first book ''[[Too Fat to Fish]]'',&lt;ref name=other/&gt; a collection of memoirs across his life co-written by [[Anthony Bozza]] that "range from funny to dark, to tragic, to sad."&lt;ref name=other/&gt; Lange dedicated the book to Stern who wrote its foreword.

After seven days, he quit treatment and spent almost $4,800 on a hotel room, women, a haircut and two pairs of sunglasses. He returned home and booked three nights at Caroline's comedy club in the same week, earning $35,000 back.&lt;ref name=rollingstone2009/&gt; Lange relapsed on heroin once more in April 2009.

On June 15, 2009, Lange made a controversial appearance on the first episode of ''[[Joe Buck Live]]'', exchanging insults with host [[Joe Buck]] that HBO Sports president [[Ross Greenburg]] said "bordered on bad taste" with a "mean-spirited" tone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/2009-06-16-artie-lange-joe-buck_N.htm|work=USA Today|first=Michael|last=McCarthy|title=Comedian Lange crosses the line on 'Joe Buck Live'|date=June 16, 2009|accessdate=February 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show was cancelled two episodes later.

In November 2009, Lange cancelled his stand-up gigs booked for rest of the year and throughout 2010. He felt "really beat" from work and needed time to recover from his heroin relapse that April, write new stand-up material,&lt;ref name=washingtonpost2009/&gt; and work on a second book, which he had begun writing under the working title ''College Is for Losers''.&lt;ref name=iconvsicon2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=nj2009/&gt; In an interview around this time Lange said, "The combination of the road and morning radio hasn't killed me, but it's come close.

In July 2011, Lange had recovered enough to resume his career.

In 2013, Lange accepted an $800,000 advance from [[Touchstone Books]] to write his second book.

=== 2014–present: Podcast, third book, ''Crashing'', and new show ===
Following the cancellation of his DirecTV show, Lange focused some time on his comedy career.

In 2015, Lange made a return to television after he secured roles on two shows. He made two guest appearances on ''[[The Jim Gaffigan Show]]'' in 2015 and 2016, respectively,&lt;ref name=philaweekly2015/&gt; and was chosen to star in a pilot episode for a new [[HBO]] comedy series titled ''[[Crashing (U.S. TV series)|Crashing]]'', starring [[Pete Holmes]] with producer and editor [[Judd Apatow]].&lt;ref name=philaweekly2015/&gt; After the series was picked up, filming began in November 2015 with Lange in a recurring role playing a loose version of himself.

On September 5, 2017, Lange co-hosted his new show, ''The Artie and Anthony Show'', with [[Anthony Cumia]] on the latter's online subscription-based network [[Compound Media]].

== Personal life ==
From 2002 to 2006, Lange was in a relationship with Dana Cironi. He met his future fiancée Adrienne Ockrymiek in 2009 at a tanning salon;&lt;ref name=rollingstone2013/&gt; they broke up in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cantonrep.com/article/20141010/Entertainment/141009356|title=Fat, wrecked, burnt and blessed: Artie Lange talks career|date=October 10, 2014|publisher=CantonRep|first=BJ|last=Lisko|accessdate=May 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2001, Lange has lived in a penthouse in [[Hoboken, New Jersey]] which he bought for $620,000. In 2008, he bought a 7,000 square-foot summer home in [[Toms River, New Jersey]] for $2.5 million with one of the rooms renovated by the ''[[Man Caves]]'' television crew.&lt;ref name=app2015&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.app.com/wlna/life/home-garden/luxury/2015/06/01/artie-lange-talks-drugs-bruce-shore-mansion/28149711/|title=Artie Lange talks drugs, Bruce, Shore mansion|date=September 16, 2015|first=Shari|last=Puterman|publisher=App.com|accessdate=August 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He put the home on the market in 2010; it was sold in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://realestate.nj.com/realestate-news/2016/05/artie_lange_home_for_sale_toms.html|title=Artie Lange unloads Toms River home for $1.1M less than he paid|date=May 31, 2016|first=Vicki|last=Hyman|publisher=NewJersey.com|accessdate=August 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lange does not consider himself a [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]], though he is [[Abortion-rights movements|pro-choice]], a supporter of [[LGBT social movements|gay rights]], and a supporter of [[Trade union|unions]] owing to his former career as a [[Stevedore|longshoreman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tmz.com/person/artie-lange/|title=Artie Lange|publisher=[[TMZ]] |accessdate=May 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has stated that as a [[convicted felon]], he cannot vote,&lt;ref name=maxim2016/&gt; but has expressed an admiration for former [[President of the United States|US Presidents]] [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Barack Obama]] while dismissing [[George W.

[[Crumbs Bake Shop|Crumbs Bakery]] offered an "Artie Lange" vanilla and chocolate cupcake with proceeds going toward the Lifebeat [[HIV/AIDS]] charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/listings/restaurant/crumbs03/menus/main.html|title=NY Mag Crumbs Menu|accessdate=March 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2008, Lifebeat refused to accept further donations from the cupcake, after Lange used a variety of anti-gay epithets towards a co-worker with whom he was arguing on-air, although they later reached an amicable truce.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.howardstern.com/show/2008/3/27/lifebeat-severs-ties-with-artie/&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, he said he felt "ashamed and embarrassed" by his previous use of anti-gay slurs in his comedy career and, while maintaining that he was never motivated by hatred and that he "still makes jokes about every group of people that there is", he is now more responsible when joking about such sensitive subjects and avoids slurs, saying "if someone came to me and told me that something I said caused some kid to commit suicide, I'd be in a nuthouse for the rest of my life, I really would."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/11/artie-lange-gay-slurs_n_4255898.html|title=Artie Lange Talks Using Gay Slurs And How Comedy Has Evolved|date=11 November 2013|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 2010s, Lange became a diabetic and requires daily insulin injections.&lt;ref name=beast2018/&gt;
