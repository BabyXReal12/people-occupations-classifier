After graduating in 1996, Swardson decided to pursue stand-up comedy rather than attend college.&lt;ref name=ASBURY&gt;{{cite news |title=Comedy is a calling for Nick Swardson |first=Ed |last=Condran |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/app/access/1770635631.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Mar+18%2C+2006&amp;author=ED+CONDRAN&amp;pub=Asbury+Park+Press&amp;desc=Comedy+is+a+calling+for+Nick+Swardson&amp;pqatl=google |newspaper=Asbury Park Press |date=March 18, 2006 |accessdate=February 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Swardson was a fan of sketch comedy, he saw stand-up comedy as a stepping-stone to a career in film, more so than he would working within a comedy troupe.&lt;ref name=NYT1/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT3/&gt;&lt;ref name=SPLITSIDER&gt;{{cite web |url=http://splitsider.com/2011/10/nick-swardson-on-bucky-larson-pretend-time-and-the-critics |title=Nick Swardson On Bucky Larson, Pretend Time and the Critics |last=Kiefer |first=Halle |date=October 3, 2011 |work=Splitsider |publisher=The Awl |accessdate=February 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

After garnering some attention within comedy circles, Swardson was selected to perform stand-up at the [[The Comedy Festival|U.S. Comedy Arts Festival]] at 20 years of age.&lt;ref name=CITY/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT3/&gt;  The festival, which up to 2007 was held in [[Aspen, Colorado]], was a yearly festival attended by entertainment insiders and was a place for comics and comedic actors to get exposure to the industry.&lt;ref name=CITY/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT3/&gt;&lt;ref name=NINENEWS&gt;{{cite news |title=US Comedy Arts Festival leaving Aspen for '08  |first1=Sara |last1=Gandy |first2=Kirk |last2=Mongomery |url=http://www.9news.com/news/story.aspx?storyid=69818&amp;catid=222 |newspaper=9 News Colorado |date=May 11, 2007 |accessdate=February 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was once the largest comedy convention of its kind in the US and became the launch pad for many comedians and comedy writers.&lt;ref name=NYT3/&gt;&lt;ref name=ASPEN&gt;{{cite news |title=HBO pulls U.S. Comedy Arts Festival |first=Stewart |last=Oksenhorn |url=http://www.aspentimes.com/article/20070512/NEWS/70512001 |newspaper=The Aspen Times |date=May 12, 2007 |accessdate=February 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DENVER&gt;{{cite news |title=No joke: Comedy fest may leave Aspen behind Insiders worry about growth |first=Mark |last=Harden |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=DP&amp;p_theme=dp&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EAF44CCA822CD67&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM |newspaper=Denver Post |date=March 9, 1998 |accessdate=February 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Swardson's first performance at the festival comedian Tony Camin, acting as the night's [[Master of Ceremonies|MC]], was quoted as saying: "There's a deal waiting to happen.

Swardson eventually left the Minneapolis–Saint Paul area for [[New York City]] where he would appear in such venues as the [[Luna Lounge]], then on to [[Los Angeles]] where he headlined at many nightclubs.&lt;ref name=NYTBIO/&gt;&lt;ref name=CITY/&gt;&lt;ref name=STARPULSE2/&gt;&lt;ref name=PRESS2&gt;{{cite press release |title=OMG, What's That Smell?

In 2004, Swardson wrote, produced and starred in a TV show pilot for Comedy Central called ''Gay Robot'', which was based on [[Gay Robot|a comedy bit by the same name]] that appeared on Adam Sandler's fifth album, ''[[Shh...Don't Tell]]''; Comedy Central, however, decided to pass on the TV project.&lt;ref name=STARPULSE2/&gt;  Swardson then had intentions on making it an animated show, but the show never came to fruition.&lt;ref name=STARPULSE2/&gt; A copy of the live-action pilot was however made available on [[MySpace]] in January 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myspace.com/video/gay-robot/gay-robot/5006295 ''Gay Robot''] on [[MySpace]]&lt;/ref&gt; Swardson also resurrected the Gay Robot character on his Comedy Central Series ''[[Nick Swardson's Pretend Time]]''.

Swardson's sketch comedy show ''Nick Swardson's Pretend Time'', premiered on Comedy Central on October 12, 2010 and ran for two seasons.
