Lynch also participated as a ''[[Manager (Gaelic games)|bainisteoir]]'' in the second series of the [[RTÉ One]]'s ''[[Celebrity Bainisteoir]]''. She is said to have established a following among the Irish [[Homosexuality|gay community]].&lt;ref name="na_bainisteoirí"/&gt;

==Career==
Lynch began her career as part of the Irish gay scene.&lt;ref name=quick_question/&gt; This part of her career included winning Miss Alternative Ireland in 1998 as "Tampy Lillette" (a skit on Country &amp; Western singer Tammy Wynette, with each costume trimmed with tampons. She went on to star as Busty Lycra  in her regular Thursday night show in GUBU Bar in her show G Spot, with a variety of guest "artists". Meyler and Lynch adapted their characters for television and produced three shows; ''Katherine Lynch's Working Girls'', ''Katherine Lynch's Wonderwomen'' and ''An Audience with Katherine Lynch''.&lt;ref name="na_bainisteoirí"/&gt;

''Katherine Lynch's Working Girls'' was her first television series.&lt;ref name=wonderwomen_bio/&gt; The three-part series was broadcast on RTÉ Two on Tuesday nights in January 2008.&lt;ref name=lynch_mob/&gt; The series featured three of Lynch's characters; Singin' Bernie Walsh, Sheila Sheik and Busty Lycra.&lt;ref name=lynch_mob/&gt; The comedian described it as a "hybrid" series, featuring both sketches and interaction with the general public.&lt;ref name=lynch_mob/&gt; The ''[[Irish Independent]]'' referred to it as being "in the spirit of the 'comedy of cringe' vein which is so in vogue".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/tv-radio/katherine-lynchs-working-girls-1264602.html|title=Katherine Lynch's Working Girls|newspaper=Irish Independent|date=12 January 2008|accessdate=12 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Katherine Lynch's Wonderwomen'' began airing on 20 October 2008.&lt;ref name=quick_question/&gt; It was the first production by WAKA TV, a company established by Lynch and Myler.&lt;ref name=wonderwomen_about/&gt; The six-part series focused on the exploits of four characters, Singin' Bernie Walsh, Sheila Sheik and two new characters, Liz Hurley and Dalkey Dunphy Davenport.&lt;ref name=wonderwomen_about&gt;[http://www.rte.ie/tv/katherinelynch/about.html "Katherine Lynch's Wonderwomen &amp;ndash; About the Show"]. RTÉ. Retrieved 28 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

''An Audience with Katherine Lynch'' followed this in December 2008, described by ''Irish Independent'' critic John Boland as "an hour-long show in which Katherine Lynch's ego was allowed to run rampant in front of an audience of minor celebrities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=John|last=Boland|url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/tv-radio/rte-comedy-youre-having-a-laugh-1597863.html|title=RTE comedy?

Lynch was a ''bainisteoir'' in the second series of ''Celebrity Bainisteoir'' in 2009.&lt;ref name="na_bainisteoirí"/&gt; She managed [[Dromahair GAA]] in Leitrim, claiming that the passion she felt for her county was her motivation to take part in the show.&lt;ref name=take_charge_of_dromahair/&gt; Dromahair competed against the [[George Hook]]-managed [[Cuala Casements GAA]] of [[Dalkey]], [[County Dublin]] in the tournament's quarter-final.&lt;ref name=take_charge_of_dromahair&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.leitrimobserver.ie/news/celebrity-bainisteoir-katherine-lynch-.4776073.jp|title='Celebrity Bainisteoir' Katherine Lynch to take charge of Dromahair|newspaper=[[Leitrim Observer]]|date=11 December 2008|accessdate=11 December 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150514030239/http://www.leitrimobserver.ie/news/local-news/celebrity-bainisteoir-katherine-lynch-to-take-charge-of-dromahair-1-2032595|archivedate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon reaching the final, she appeared alongside her opponent [[Derek Davis]] on ''[[Tubridy Tonight]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/arts/2009/0508/tubridytonight.html|title=Tubridy's Saturday line-up revealed|publisher=RTÉ|date=8 May 2009|accessdate=8 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characters==
Lynch is known for her multiplicity of characters and her confusion over which one is her personal favourite.
