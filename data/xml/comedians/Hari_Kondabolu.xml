From 2012 to 2013, he was on the writing staff for the [[FX (TV channel)|FX]] comedy series ''[[Totally Biased with W. Kamau Bell]]'', produced by [[Chris Rock]] and hosted by [[W. Kamau Bell]], on which he often appeared as a correspondent. During that period, [[Rand Paul]] criticized the "Make Chai Not War" initiative during Congressional hearings on [[2012 Benghazi attack|the Benghazi controversy]]. Kondabolu responded in a Totally Biased segment, observing that the approximately $800 million USD that the State Department spends yearly sending artists to perform worldwide is far less than the US spends on war: "apparently after you spend trillions starting wars, people get angry at you."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Hari Kondabolu|title=Benghazi Senate Hearing by Hari Kondabolu|date=2015-12-24|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGKuQOeLEsg|work=Totally Biased with W.

===Artistic philosophy, focus, and development ===
Kondabolu's humor often centers on social issues such as poverty, racism, and a rejection of [[Indian stereotype|Indian stereotypes seen in media]]. He describes writing a July 2003 joke, which focused on the [[British Raj]] taking the [[Koh-i-Noor]] diamond from India, as "the first time I thought, 'Okay, this is who I actually am. This is what I actually believe.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.saada.org/tides/article/20130311-1319|title=An Interview with Hari Kondabolu|last=Desai|first=Manan|date=2013-03-12|website=Tides Magazine|publisher=South Asian American Digital Archive|access-date=2016-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He takes issue with the label "political" being applied to his work, instead framing his comedy as addressing everyday issues that affect his and the audience's lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.portlandmercury.com/portland/these-laughs-kill-fascists/Content?oid=2610407|title=These Laughs Kill Fascists: The "Political" Comedy of Laughter Against the Machine|last=Tonry|first=Andrew R|date=2010-06-17|website=Portland Mercury|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kondabolu said: ''"''I called the record '''Mainstream American Comic''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' because I believe the ideas I'm talking about should be part of the mainstream discussion.''"''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.alternet.org/media/hari-kondabolu-americas-smartest-and-funniest-mainstream-comic|title=Hari Kondabolu: America's Smartest and Funniest 'Mainstream Comic'|last=Holloway|first=Kali|date=2016-07-21|newspaper=AlterNet|access-date=2016-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; He compares his work to that of [[The Clash]], contrasting his approach to that of the [[Sex Pistols]]: instead of engaging in contrariness for contrariness's sake, he focuses on issues of justice and fairness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.straight.com/arts/361711/comedian-hari-kondabolu-gets-philosophical|title=Comedian Hari Kondabolu gets philosophical|last=MacPherson|first=Guy|date=2014-12-02|website=The Georgia Straight|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in Kondabolu's stand-up comedy career, he was willing to use [[Stereotype|stereotypes]] of Indians, including Indian accents, to get laughs. He characterizes his immediately post-[[September 11 attacks|9/11]] work as self-important political argument at the expense of humor; he credits his time in the Seattle stand-up scene with teaching him that "you need the joke. I learned to value the joke again."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2014/03/catching-up-with-hari-kondabolu.html|title=Catching Up With Hari Kondabolu|last=Ham|first=Robert|date=2014-03-10|website=Paste Magazine|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of late 2017, Kondabolu is taking his mother's advice and diversifying the topics he discusses in his comedy, working on new material that puts more of his personal vulnerability onstage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/theater/you-cannot-kill-comedy-an-interview-with-comic-social-critic-and-twitter-troll-magnet-hari-kondabolu/|title=You cannot ‘kill comedy’: an interview with comic, social critic and Twitter-troll magnet Hari Kondabolu|date=2017-12-13|work=The Seattle Times|access-date=2017-12-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Podcast host ===
He and his younger brother Ashok performed in a monthly mostly improvised talk show together in [[New York City]] called ''Untitled Kondabolu Brothers Project''. Past guests have included [[Ajay Naidu]], [[Aasif Mandvi]], Bell, [[Leo Allen]], [[Victor Vazquez (musician)|Victor Vazquez]] (Kool AD of Das Racist), [[Charles Mudede]] and [[Blue Scholars]]. In January 2013, they started ''Untitled Kondabolu Brothers Podcast''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kondabolubrothers.com/|title=Kondabolu Brothers|website=www.kondabolubrothers.com|access-date=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a hiatus from 2015 onwards, the podcast debuted again as the ''Kondabolu Brothers Podcast'' in 2018 on the [[Earwolf]] label.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/harikondabolu/status/970437184074407936|title=The Kondabolu Brothers Podcast debuts THIS THURSDAY MARCH 8TH on @earwolf.|last=Kondabolu|first=Hari|date=4 Mar 2018|website=@harikondabolu|language=en|access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.earwolf.com/show/kondabolu-brothers/|title=Kondabolu Brothers podcast on Earwolf|website=www.earwolf.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Online activism ==
In 2014, Kondabolu started an online campaign joining [[Washington Redskins name controversy|activists]] asking the [[Washington Redskins]] to change their name or logo,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/newsblogs/yourcommunity/2014/10/comedian-urges-washington-redskins-to-adopt-sunburned-white-person-as-their-logo.html|title=Comedian urges Washington Redskins to adopt 'sunburned white person' as their logo|last=O'Neil|first=Lauren|date=2014-10-21|website=CBC|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting viewers use the [[Twitter]] [[hashtag]] #NewRedskinsLogo to share their proposed changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mic.com/articles/101974/this-comedian-has-a-brilliant-alternative-to-the-redskins-logo|title=This Comedian Has a Brilliant Alternative to the Redskins Logo|last=Valinsky|first=Jordan|date=2014-10-21|website=Mic|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kondabolu argued that if Redskins owners and fans were unwilling to change their name away from one "stereotyping Native Americans", then the Redskins logo should change to one portraying "a severely sunburned white person".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/sapna/hari-kondabolu-redskins-logo-campaign|title=A Comedian Is Campaigning To Make The Redskins Logo A Sunburned White Guy|last=Maheshwari|first=Sapna|date=2014-10-21|website=Buzzfeed|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Kondabolu, criticizing Louisiana governor [[Bobby Jindal]] as "disingenuous", started the #BobbyJindalIsSoWhite Twitter hashtag.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2015/0625/Bobby-Jindal-wants-to-downplay-his-Indian-heritage-but-Twitter-won-t-let-him-video|title=Bobby Jindal wants to downplay his Indian heritage, but Twitter won't let him (+video)|last=Caspari|first=Sarah|date=2015-06-25|newspaper=Christian Science Monitor|issn=0882-7729|access-date=2016-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said: "You can say that about all politicians, but there's something about how he uses his story about being the son of Indian immigrants and then at the same time talks about how we're all Americans and should get rid of hyphenated identities [that bothers me]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mic.com/articles/121382/bobby-jindal-hari-kondabolu-twitter-so-white|title=This Indian-American Comedian Turned Bobby Jindal Into the Internet's Biggest Punchline|last=King|first=Jamilah|date=2015-06-29|website=Mic|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each day during the [[Presidency of Donald Trump|presidency]] of [[Donald Trump]], Kondabolu [[Twitter|tweets]]: "REMINDER FOR DAY [number] OF PRESIDENCY: THIS IS NOT NORMAL (AND NORMAL WASN’T THAT GREAT EITHER)."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mspmag.com/arts-and-culture/the-morning-after/laughter-makes-the-truth-come-easier/|title=Making America Laugh Again|last=Matt|first=Lianna|date=2017-04-14|work=Mpls.St.Paul Magazine|access-date=2017-12-24|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Acting and film ==
Kondabolu wrote and starred in Zia Mohajerjasbi's 2007 short film ''Manoj'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/1807851|title=MANOJ|last=Mohajerjasbi|first=Zia|date=2008-09-24|website=Vimeo|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has played in comedy and film festivals around the world, including the [[Just for Laughs]] Festivals in [[Montreal]] and [[Chicago]], and which mocks comedians who broadly exploit their ethnic backgrounds for their material.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.harikondabolu.com/2010/05/manoj-krishnamurthy-is-dead/|title=MANOJ KRISHNAMURTHY IS DEAD — Hari Kondabolu|website=www.harikondabolu.com|access-date=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Manoj ,'' Kondabolu portrays both Manoj, a fictional Indian immigrant comic who plays to white audiences by repeating their stereotypes of South Asians, and an Indian-American who is critical of Manoj's approach. He made ''Manoj'' to speak to and about artists of color; as Shruti Swamy summarized, "for Kondabolu, the film is about [[Minstrel show|minstrelsy]]-the idea of making a caricature of your background, or playing into stereotypes, not to challenge them, but to reinforce them".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Yes, We Can|last=Swamy|first=Shruti|date=February 2009|work=|newspaper=India Currents|issue=22.10|pages=10–12, 14|access-date=|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critical reception and honors ==
The ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' called Kondabolu in mid-2016 "one of the most necessary political comedians working today", saying that "his material addresses culture and current events through a sharp lens of progressive politics and his clever, very funny perspective".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/29/arts/comedy-listings-for-july-29-aug-4.html|title=Comedy Listings for July 29-Aug. 4|date=2016-07-28|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the ''[[The Portland Mercury|Portland Mercury]]'' said that Kondabolu "stays clear of being overly preachy"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.portlandmercury.com/BlogtownPDX/archives/2010/04/13/better-know-a-bridgetown-comic-part-7-of-150|title=Better Know A Bridgetown Comic: Part 7 of 150|last=Tonry|first=Andrew R.|date=2010-04-13|website=Blogtown|publisher=The Portland Mercury|access-date=2016-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and compared his comedy to the work of hip-hop group [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]]: "As a comedian Kondabolu is vicious, uncompromised and without taste for fools."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.portlandmercury.com/BlogtownPDX/archives/2011/11/09/tonight-hari-kondabolu|title=Tonight: Hari Kondabolu|last=Tonry|first=Andrew R.|date=2011-11-09|website=Blogtown|publisher=The Portland Mercury|access-date=2016-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Flavorwire]]'' described Kondabolu as "[[Tumblr]]'s favorite comedian".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://flavorwire.com/439301/25-comedians-of-color-everyone-should-know/9|title=25 Comedians of Color Everyone Should Know|last=Herman|first=Alison|date=2014-02-26|website=Flavorwire|publisher=|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholar Rebecca Krefting devoted a chapter to Kondabolu's work in ''All Joking Aside: American Humor and Its Discontents'', contrasting his "early reliance on modern-day minstrelsy with a subsequent self-imposed dictum to create humor that does not harm, that is, his current repertoire of charged humor.... in a sea of comics deploying modern-day minstrelsy or hacky stereotype jokes, Kondabolu stands out among his colleagues for his commitment to conscientious charged humor".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/884280109|title=All joking aside : American humor and its discontents|last=1978-|first=Krefting, Rebecca,|isbn=9781421414317|oclc=884280109}}&lt;/ref&gt;
