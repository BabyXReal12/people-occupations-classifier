'''Louis Nye''' (May 1, 1913 – October 9, 2005) was an [[United States|American]] comedic actor.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news| work=[[The New York Times]]| title=Louis Nye, 92, Comic Actor and Sidekick to Steve Allen, Dies| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/11/arts/television/louis-nye-92-comic-actor-and-sidekick-to-steve-allen-dies.html| date=October 11, 2005| first=James| last=Barron| accessdate=November 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was an entertainer to the troops during [[World War II]] and is best known for his work on countless television, film and radio programs.

==Early years==
He was born '''Louis Neistat''' in [[Hartford, Connecticut]], son of Joseph Neistat and Jennie Sherman. His sister Rose Neistat was born in 1917. Although Nye, who pronounced his [[given name]] as Louie, later claimed he was born in 1922, he is listed as age six in the 1920 Hartford County, Connecticut, [[Federal government of the United States|Federal]] [[Census]].

Nye's parents were both [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] speaking [[Jew]]s from the [[Russian Empire]]. They [[emigrate]]d to the [[United States]] in 1906, and became [[Naturalization|naturalized]] [[Citizenship|citizens]] in 1911. His father owned a small grocery store, which his wife helped him run. Louis Nye attended Weaver High School, but he was not a good student. "My marks were so low," he explained, "that they wouldn't let me in the drama club. So I went down to [[WTIC (AM)|WTIC]] Radio, auditioned, and got on a show."

==Radio and television==
Nye decided to go to [[New York City]], where he worked in [[radio programming|radio]], playing various roles on [[soap opera]]s. He recalled, "I still think of myself as an actor. In the radio days, I was busy playing rotten Nazis, rich uncles and emotional juveniles -- the whole span -- and the only time I tried to be funny was at parties."

Nye served in the [[United States Army]] during [[World War II]], and because he earned laughs by mimicking other [[soldier]]s, he was assigned to run the recreation hall. Following his discharge, he returned to New York and began working in live [[television program|television]]. He also appeared in several [[stage play|plays]] on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], and made many appearances on television variety shows such as [[The Jack Benny Program]] (including one memorable turn as a crying cab driver), [[Jimmy Durante|The Jimmy Durante Show]], [[The Pat Boone Chevy Showroom]] and [[Victor Borge|The Victor Borge Show]].

He earned his greatest fame as a regular on [[The Steve Allen Show]], performing with Allen, [[Don Knotts]],  [[Tom Poston]], [[Pat Harrington Jr.]], [[Dayton Allen]], [[Gabriel Dell]] and [[Bill Dana (comedian)|Bill Dana]]. He primarily played urbane, wealthy—and often fey—bon vivants; as part of the weekly "Man on the Street" sketches, his characterization of the pretentious country-club braggart Gordon Hathaway, with his catchphrase, "Hi-ho, Steverino," plus Allen's inability to resist bursting into hysterical laughter at his ad-libs, made Nye one of the favorites on Allen's show. When production moved to [[Los Angeles]], Nye went too and became a character actor in [[Hollywood]].

Nye was cast as a guest star on many television series, including [[Make Room for Daddy]], [[Guestward, Ho!]], [[Burke's Law (1963 TV series)|Burke's Law]], [[The Munsters]]; [[Love, American Style]]; [[Laverne &amp; Shirley]], [[Starsky and Hutch]], [[Police Woman (TV series)|Police Woman]], [[Fantasy Island]], [[St. Elsewhere]] and [[The Cosby Show]].

Nye played [[dentist]] Delbert Gray on several episodes of [[The Ann Sothern Show]] from 1960 to 1961, the romantic interest of Olive Smith, played by [[Ann Tyrrell]] (1909–1983). Nye also played Sonny Drysdale, the spoiled rich stepson of the banker, [[Milburn Drysdale]], on CBS's [[The Beverly Hillbillies]] during the 1962 season. He did six episodes, and received more mail than from anything else he had ever done on television, but the character was dropped. It was rumored that someone in the CBS network, or a sponsor, thought Sonny was too "sissified". However, Nye revived the character briefly during the 1966 season.

Nye was a member of the cast of the [[sitcom|situation comedy]] [[Needles and Pins (TV series)|Needles and Pins]], playing Harry Karp. The sitcom, which starred [[Norman Fell]], ran for 14 episodes in the autumn of 1973.

Nye also recorded a few comedy [[Gramophone record|LPs]], doing a variety of characterizations. Unfortunately, he never had the opportunity to reach his potential in [[film|movies]]. Many of his character roles were little more than cameos. Nevertheless, he performed with [[movie star|stars]] such as [[Lucille Ball]], [[Bob Hope]], [[Jack Lemmon]], [[Dean Martin]], [[Walter Matthau]], [[Robert Mitchum]], [[Jack Webb]] and [[Joanne Woodward]], among others. Nye also appeared on the lecture circuit, in concerts and in nightclubs, and did voice work in [[animation]], such as [[Inspector Gadget (1983 TV series)|Inspector Gadget]] with [[Don Adams]].

==Last years==
Nye never retired. He completed a 24-city tour of the country for Columbia Artists, ending the tour with a two-week stint at the [[Sahara Hotel and Casino|Sahara]] in [[Las Vegas Strip|Las Vegas]]. At age 92, he continued to work, appearing in his recurring role of Jeff Greene's father on [[HBO]]'s ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'' from 2000 to 2005.

Nye lived in [[Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles, California|Pacific Palisades]] with his wife, pianist-songwriter Anita Leonard, who wrote the standard, "[[A Sunday Kind of Love]]." Married since the late 1940s, they had a son, artist Peter Nye. Nye was also the great uncle of filmmakers Casey Neistat and Van Neistat and [[stuntman]] Dean Neistat.

Louis Nye died of [[lung cancer]]. His body was interred at [[Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery]] in [[Culver City, California]].
