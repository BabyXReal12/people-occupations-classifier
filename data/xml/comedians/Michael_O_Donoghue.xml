'''Michael O'Donoghue'''  (January 5, 1940&amp;nbsp;– November 8, 1994) was an American writer and performer. He was known for his [[Black comedy|dark and destructive style of comedy]] and humor, was a major contributor to [[National Lampoon (magazine)|''National Lampoon'' magazine]], and was the first head writer of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. He was also the first performer to utter a line on that series.

==Early life==
O'Donoghue was born '''Michael Henry Donohue''' in [[Sauquoit, New York]]. His father, Michael, worked as an engineer, while his mother, Barbara, stayed home to raise him.

O'Donoghue's early career included work as a playwright and stage actor at the [[University of Rochester]] where he drifted in and out of school beginning in 1959. His first published writing appeared in the school's humor magazine ''Ugh!''

After a brief time working as a writer in San Francisco, California, O'Donoghue returned to Rochester and participated in regional theater. During this period, he formed a group called Bread and Circuses specifically to perform his early plays which were of an experimental nature and often quite disturbing to the local audience. Among these are an absurdist work exploring themes of [[Sadomasochism|Sadism]] entitled "The Twilight Maelstrom of [[Cookie Lavagetto]]", a cycle of one-act plays called ''Le Theatre de Malaise'' and the 1964 dark satire ''The Death of JFK''.

His first work of greater note was the picaresque feature "[[The Adventures of Phoebe Zeit-Geist]]", published as a serial in ''[[Evergreen Review]]''. This was an erotic satire of the comic book genre, later released in revised and expanded form as a book by that magazine's publisher, [[Grove Press]]. Drawn by [[Frank Springer]], the comic detailed the adventures of [[debutante]] Phoebe Zeit-Geist as she was variously kidnapped and rescued by a series of bizarre [[Inuit]], [[Nazis]], [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] [[foot fetish]]ists, [[lesbian]] [[assassination|assassin]]s and other characters. ''[[Doonesbury]]'' comic-strip creator [[Garry Trudeau]] cited the strip as an early inspiration, saying, "[A] very heavy influence was a serial in the Sixties called 'Phoebe Zeitgeist'. . . . It was an absolutely brilliant, deadpan send-up of adventure comics, but with a very edgy modernist kind of approach. To this day, I hold virtually every panel in my brain. It's very hard not to steal from it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Kidd|first= Chip| authorlink=Chip Kidd| url = https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/17390/226848 |title=''Doonesbury'' Turns 40: Garry Trudeau reflects on his days at Yale, his Pulitzer Prize-winning comic, and how he envisions it ending|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date= October 27, 2010|accessdate=
May 27, 2017| archivedate= December 23, 2016| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161223032012/http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/doonesbury-turns-40-20101027| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, O'Donoghue worked with illustrator and fellow ''Evergreen Review'' veteran Phil Wende to create the illustrated book ''The Incredible, Thrilling Adventures of the Rock''. Biographer Dennis Perrin described it as having "no plot. The same rock sits in the same spot in the same forest for thousands of years. Nothing much happens. Then, while two boys roam the wood in search of a Christmas tree, one sees the rock and is inspired."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Perrin |first=Dennis |title=Mr. Mike: The Life and Work of Michael O'Donoghue |publisher=Avon Books |year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taking the idea to the publisher [[Random House]], the pair sold the book to the young editor [[Christopher Cerf (musician and television producer)|Christopher Cerf]]. Cerf was a former member of the ''[[Harvard Lampoon]]'', and O'Donoghue's first acquaintance from that group. Through Cerf, O'Donoghue would meet [[George W. S. Trow]] and other former ''Lampoon'' writers looking to start a national comedy magazine.

In 1969, O'Donoghue and Trow co-wrote the script for the [[James Ivory (director)|James Ivory]] / [[Ismail Merchant]] film ''[[Savages (1972 film)|Savages]]''. This film tells the story of a tribe of prehistoric "Mud People" who happen upon a deserted [[The Great Gatsby|Gatsby]]-esque 1930s manor house. The Mud People evolve into contemporary high-society types who enjoy a decadent weekend party at the manor before ultimately devolving back into Mud People. ''Savages'' was eventually released in 1972.

==''National Lampoon'' magazine==
O'Donoghue was, along with [[Henry Beard]] and [[Doug Kenney]], a founding writer and later an editor for the [[satire|satiric]] [[National Lampoon (magazine)|''National Lampoon'' magazine]]. As one of many outstanding ''National Lampoon'' contributors, O'Donoghue created some of the distinctive [[black comedy]] which characterized the magazine's flavor for most of its first decade. His most famous contributions include "The Vietnamese Baby Book", in which a baby's war wounds are cataloged in a keepsake; the "Ezra Taft Benson High School Yearbook", a precursor to the ''Lampoon''{{'}}s ''High School Yearbook Parody''; the comic "Tarzan of the Cows"; and the continuing feature "Underwear for the Deaf".

He was also the editor and main contributor to the ''Lampoon'''s ''Encyclopedia of Humor.'' He co-wrote the album ''[[Radio Dinner]]'' with [[Tony Hendra]], and because of the album's success, he was assigned to direct and act on ''[[The National Lampoon Radio Hour]]''. After 13 episodes, publisher [[Matty Simmons]] asked O'Donoghue to return to the magazine. A week later, O'Donoghue and Simmons argued over what was later revealed to be a simple misunderstanding, and O'Donoghue left.

It was at the ''Lampoon'' that O'Donoghue met [[Anne Beatts]], with whom he became romantically involved. The two later moved on to work at ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' together.

==''Saturday Night Live''==
On the pioneering late-night [[sketch comedy]] program ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (originally called ''NBC Saturday Night''), on which creator and executive producer [[Lorne Michaels]] assigned him the position of head writer, O'Donoghue appeared in the first show's opening sketch as an English-language teacher, instructing [[John Belushi]] to repeat phrases such as "I would like to feed your fingertips to the wolverines," and "We are out of badgers. Would you accept a wolverine in its place?" before dropping dead of a heart attack. He later made appearances in the persona of a [[Las Vegas Strip|Vegas-style]] "impressionist" who would pay great praise to showbiz mainstays such as [[talk show]] host [[Mike Douglas]] and singers [[Tony Orlando and Dawn]]—and then speculate how they'd react if steel needles were plunged into their eyes. The shrieking fits that followed are believed by biographer Dennis Perrin to be inspired by O'Donoghue's real-life agonies from chronic [[migraine]] headaches.

O'Donoghue, in his refusal to write for [[Jim Henson]]'s Muppet characters which appeared in the early years of SNL, quipped, "I won't write for felt."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Shales | first=Tom |authorlink=Tom Shales |author2=Miller, James Andrew |author-link2=James Andrew Miller |title=Live From New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live |publisher=[[Little, Brown and Company]] |year =2002 |location=[[Boston, Massachusetts]] |pages=79–80 |isbn=0-316-78146-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, O'Donoghue cultivated the persona of the grim "Mr. Mike", a coldly decadent figure who favored viewers with comically dark "Least-Loved Bedtime Stories" such as "The Little Engine that Died."  His other ''SNL'' sketches range from a black-and-white ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' parody to a ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' spoof that was a tour-de-force for Belushi.

O'Donoghue shared ''SNL'' [[Emmy Award]]s for outstanding writing in 1976 and 1977. He left the series in the fall of 1978, after three years.

In 1979, he produced a television special for NBC, featuring most of the ''SNL'' cast, called ''[[Mr. Mike's Mondo Video]].'' Because of its raunchy content, the network rejected the program, which was then released as a theatrical film.

O'Donoghue returned to ''SNL'' in 1981 when new executive producer [[Dick Ebersol]] needed an old hand to help revive the faltering series. O'Donoghue's volatile personality and mood swings made this difficult: His first day on the show he screamed at all the cast members, forcing everyone to write on the walls with magic markers. This horrified [[Catherine O'Hara]] so much that she quit before ever appearing on air. The only one he liked was [[Eddie Murphy]], reportedly because Murphy wasn't afraid of him. According to the book ''Live From New York'' O'Donoghue tried to shake things up on that first day by saying "this is what the show lacks" and spray-painting the word "DANGER" on the wall of his office.

O'Donoghue was released from the show after writing the never-aired sketch "The Last Days in Silverman's Bunker," which compared NBC network president [[Fred Silverman]]'s problems at the network to [[Adolf Hitler]]'s final days.&lt;ref name=MoJo&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Young|first1=Charles|title=Michael O'Donoghue Pokes Fun Till it Bleeds|journal=Mother Jones|date=December 1983|volume=8|issue=10|pages=18–22, 48–49|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bOYDAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PT21&amp;ots=BKQk0F9vAM&amp;pg=PT21#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was planned that John Belushi would return to play Silverman, and a great deal of work had been done on creating sets for the sketch (which would have run for about twenty minutes), including the construction of a large [[coat of arms of Germany#Nazi Germany|Nazi eagle]] clutching an NBC corporate logo instead of a [[swastika]]. Another unaired O'Donoghue sketch from around the same period, "The Good Excuse," also involved Nazi jokes. In the sketch, a captured German officer berated by his captors for Nazi war crimes explains that he had a good excuse, which he whispers into their ears, inaudible to the viewers. His captors are quickly persuaded that the unheard excuse was, in fact, an acceptable reason for the crimes of the Third Reich.

On October 26, 1986, O'Donoghue was further connected to ''SNL'' by virtue of his marriage to the show's musical director, Cheryl Hardwick,&lt;ref name=death&gt;{{cite news|last=Carter|first=Bill|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/10/obituaries/michael-o-donoghue-54-dies-writer-for-saturday-night-live.html |accessdate=July 20, 2015 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=November 10, 1994| title=Michael O'Donoghue, 54, Dies; Writer for 'Saturday Night Live' |location=[[New York, New York]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  in the late 1980s. The union was fodder for a "Weekend Update" joke in which [[Dennis Miller]] noted that the couple was registered at [[Black and Decker]].

O'Donoghue was one of several original writers rehired by [[Lorne Michaels]] upon his return to produce the show in 1985. O'Donoghue's intention was to write and direct short films for the show; however, none were completed and he wrote little else, apart from a monologue seemingly designed to humiliate [[Chevy Chase]] when he hosted the second show of the season.  (The monologue began, "Right after I stopped doing cocaine, I turned into a giant garden slug, and, for the life of me, I don't know why.")  The monologue never aired, and O'Donoghue was fired a month later after telling ''The New York Times'' that ''SNL'' had become "an embarrassment.  It's like watching old men die."  His final contribution to the show was a song, "Boulevard of Broken Balls," co-written with his wife Hardwick and performed by Christopher Walken on the October 24, 1992, episode.

==Other work==
O'Donoghue acted in a supporting role in the 1985 comedy ''[[Head Office]]''. He had small parts in the 1979 movie ''[[Manhattan (1979 movie)|Manhattan]]'' (which poked fun at SNL), the [[1987 in film|1987 movie]] ''[[Wall Street (1987 film)|Wall Street]]'', and the [[1988 in film|1988 movie]] he co-wrote, ''[[Scrooged]]''. O'Donoghue said he loathed the theatrical release of ''Scrooged'', insisting until his death that he and co-writer and best friend [[Mitch Glazer]] had written a much better film. He also wrote or co-wrote a number of unproduced screenplays of which ''Saturday Matinee'' (aka ''Planet of the Cheap Special Effects'') remains legendary in Hollywood screenwriter circles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Evans|first=Bradford|title=The Lost Roles of Chevy Chase|url=http://splitsider.com/2011/09/the-lost-roles-of-chevy-chase/|publisher=SplitSider.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Donoghue also found some success as a [[country music]] songwriter, his most notable credit being [[Dolly Parton]]'s "[[Single Women]]" (1982).  The song, originally composed for a 1981 ''SNL'' skit, later inspired the 1984 [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] TV movie ''[[Single Bars, Single Women]]'' starring [[Tony Danza]] and [[Jean Smart]], which was produced by O'Donoghue.

In 1992, O'Donoghue created a sketch show pilot called ''TV'' for the [[Fox Networks Group|Fox network]]. It featured [[Kelly Lynch]] and it was directed by [[Walter Williams (comedian filmmaker)|Walter Williams]], the creator of ''[[Mr. Bill]]'', but like a lot of O'Donoghue's work, it was too out there for [[Prime time|primetime]] TV.

==Death==
O'Donoghue suffered a long history of chronic [[migraine|migraine headaches]] during his career. On November 8, 1994, O'Donoghue died of a [[Intracerebral hemorrhage|cerebral hemorrhage]] at age 54.&lt;ref name=death /&gt;
