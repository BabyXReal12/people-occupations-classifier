'''David William Hughes''' (born 26 November 1970) is an Australian stand-up comedian, radio and television presenter.

He is known for his [[larrikin]] personality, drawling Australian accent, and deadpan comedic delivery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/celebrity/dave-hughes-in-canberra-as-part-of-australia-tour-20140622-zsf7m.html|title=Dave Hughes in Canberra as part of Australia tour|last=Hogan|first=Jil|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=19 June 2014|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hughes co-hosts ''[[Hughesy &amp; Kate]]'' with [[Kate Langbroek]] on the [[Hit Network]] and hosts ''[[Hughesy, We Have a Problem]]'' on [[Network Ten]].

==Early life==
After graduating from the all-boys [[List of Christian Brothers schools|Christian Brothers' College, Warrnambool]] in 1988, where he was [[dux]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rae|first1=Harvey|title=Zemiro delivers intriguing lives|url=https://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/entertainment/a/25262854/zemiro-delivers-intriguing-lives/|publisher=Yahoo News, 15 October 2014|accessdate=27 November 2014|quote=(Hughes graduated from) the Christian Brothers' College, Warrnambool, where he graduated dux in 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hughes briefly studied [[information technology]] at [[Swinburne University]] in Melbourne, and then accounting at [[Deakin University]] in Warrnambool before dropping out to eventually pursue a career in comedy.&lt;ref name="AD" /&gt;

==Career==
===Comedy===
After leaving university, it was seven years before Hughes found work as a stand-up comedian and he did a variety of jobs including working at an abattoir, as a bricklayer's labourer and a shop assistant.&lt;ref name="AD"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/tv/enoughrope/transcripts/s1203665.htm|title=ENOUGH ROPE with Andrew Denton - episode 60: Dave Hughes (20/09/2004)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After dreaming about being a comedian since he was a youngster, his first comedy gig came at age 22 when he was living in [[Perth]] doing labouring jobs and he decided, "I'm going to have a crack". Appearing onstage he acknowledges that he was "just horrible" but after three attempts over six months he gained his confidence and went on to become a headline act.&lt;ref name="AD" /&gt;

He is a regular performer at the [[Melbourne International Comedy Festival]]. Some of his shows have been released on CD (''Dave Hughes: Whatever''), and on DVD (''Dave Hughes, Live'', ''Dave Hughes - Handy''&lt;ref&gt;[http://shop.abc.net.au/browse/product.asp?productid=739340 Dave Hughes Live – ABC Shop – The Home of Australian Content&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080303001425/http://shop.abc.net.au/browse/product.asp?productid=739340 |date=3 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''David Hughes - Pointless'').

===Television===
Hughes co-hosted the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] comedy talk show ''[[The Glass House (2001 TV series)|The Glass House]]'' along with [[Wil Anderson]] and [[Corinne Grant]]. However, it was axed in 2006 amid political controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = McManus | first = Gerard  | date = 1 November 2006 | title = ABC stones Glass House | work = [[Herald Sun]] | url = http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,20679888-662,00.html  | accessdate= 27 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has had guest spots on television programs ''[[The Fat]]'', ''[[Rove (TV series)|Rove Live]]'', ''[[The Panel (Australian TV series)|The Panel]]'', ''[[Thank God You're Here]]'', [[Under Melbourne Tonight]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.aanet.com.au/~vfok/umt/episodes/list97.htm|title=UMT list'97|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116120911/http://web.aanet.com.au/~vfok/umt/episodes/list97.htm|archivedate=16 January 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Spicks and Specks (TV series)|''Spicks &amp; Specks'']] and ''[[Have You Been Paying Attention?]]''.

In the AFL season he is a part of the Network Ten Saturday night show ''[[Before The Game]]'' alongside [[Mick Molloy]], [[Lehmo]], [[Andy Maher]] and [[Neroli Meadows]].

Hughes worked on Australian television show ''[[Rove (TV series)|Rove]]'' in 2007, with a weekly "Hughesy Loses It" segment. In 2008–09, the segment evolved into a recurring segment known as "Help me Hughesy," where he would rant about a given topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rovedaily.com.au/help-me-hughesy.htm | title = Rove Daily – Help Me Hughesy! – Rove Daily – Petespace – Exclusive Video Clips, Behind the Scenes Footage and Hughesy's Biography | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090414011202/http://www.rovedaily.com.au/help-me-hughesy.htm | archivedate = 14 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 July 2009, Hughes began co-hosting the half-hour Channel 10 show ''The 7PM Project'', which later expanded to become the hour-long ''The Project''.  His regular co-hosts were [[Charlie Pickering]], and [[Carrie Bickmore]]. In June 2011, Hughes was one of the few people to be granted a one-on-one interview with the Dalai Lama during his visit to Australia.&lt;ref name="DL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/hughesy-gets-lost-in-translation/story-e6frf7jo-1226072920722|title=Hughesy gets lost in translation|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2013, Hughes resigned from his full-time position on ''The Project'' to return to stand-up comedy. Hughes will, however, appear once a week on the show from wherever he is around the country. Hughes is quoted as saying, "It's definitely a tough decision, as we have had so many unbelievable moments on the desk. You meet some of the biggest stars in the world and chat with them and have some wonderful times". Hughes later said in an interview in 2016 that he left ''The Project'' stating "The news cycle rarely changes. Nothing changes in so long. To sit there and talk about the same things every night, it was too much."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mamamia.com.au/dave-hughes-quit-the-project/|title=Why Dave Hughes really left The Project.|author=Elissa Ratliff|publisher=Mama Mia|date=6 June 2016|access-date=13 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hughes will begin a year-long round of stand-up engagements around Australia, in Adelaide in February 2014, where he and his family will be based for five weeks before moving onto other venues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/sydney-confidential/dave-hughes-stepping-down-as-fulltime-host-of-the-project-to-go-back-to-his-first-love-of-standup-comedy/story-fni0cvc9-1226777832279 |title=Dave Hughes stepping down as full-time host of The Project to go back to his first love of stand-up comedy  |last1=Dennehy |first1=Luke |last2= |first2= |date=7 December 2013 |website=Daily telegrapgh |publisher=News Ltd |accessdate=8 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update inline|date=January 2018}}

In October 2014, Hughes guest-starred in an episode of ABC-TV's ''[[Julia Zemiro's Home Delivery]]'', in which Zemiro accompanied Hughes back to his home-town of Warrnambool to reminisce about his childhood and to explore what influenced him to embark on a career in comedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2014/10/returning-julia-zemiros-home-delivery.html|title=Returning: Julia Zemiro’s Home Delivery|work=TV Tonight}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radio===
In December 2001, Hughes joined comedians [[Kate Langbroek]] and [[Dave O'Neil]] to co-host a weekday breakfast program ''[[Hughesy &amp; Kate|Hughesy, Kate &amp; Dave]]'' from 6am to 9am on Melbourne's [[Nova 100]]. In the past, he has worked for the [[Triple M]] network of Australian [[active rock]] radio stations. [[Dave O'Neil]] later left the station to join [[Smooth 91.5|Vega 91.5]].

===Advertising===
In 2005, Hughes appeared in a series of television commercials for the Australian car manufacturer [[Holden]].

===Acting===
Early in his career, Hughes had a brief appearance in an episode of ''[[Neighbours]]'' in 1998 playing a farmer named Knuckles who punched the character of Harold Bishop ([[Ian Smith (actor)|Ian Smith]]) in the face and became embroiled in a scandalous relationship with Toadie ([[Ryan Moloney]]).

Hughes has also appeared in [[Ed Kavalee]]'s comedy films ''[[Scumbus]]'', which aired on Ch-10 in 2012 and the yet-to-screen ''Border Protection Squad''.

==Award==
In 2007 Hughes won an [[ARIA Award for Best Comedy Release]] for the DVD, ''Dave Hughes, Live'' (Liberation Music).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ariaawards.com.au/history/year/2007|title=ARIA Awards|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
He married Holly Ife, a reporter with the ''[[Herald Sun]]'', on 31 December 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/victoria/so-hughes-laughing-now/story-e6frf7kx-1111112762786 | title=So Hughes laughing now? | newspaper=[[Herald Sun]] | date=1 January 2007 | accessdate=25 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They have three children together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date = 30 April 2009 | title = Comedian Dave Hughes welcomes his first child Rafferty | work = [[The Daily Telegraph]] | url = http://www.perthnow.com.au/entertainment/perth-confidential/comedian-dave-hughes-welcomes-his-first-child-rafferty/story-e6frg30l-1225705485111 | accessdate = 27 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date = 11 April 2011 | title = All in the delivery for Dave | work = [[Herald Sun]] | url = http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/more-news/all-in-the-delivery-for-dave/story-fn7x8me2-1226036868331 | accessdate = 27 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/celebrity/dave-hughes-shares-first-pic-of-third-baby-with-twitter-fans/story-fn907478-1226559999993|title=Dave 'Hughesy' Hughes shares first picture of newborn baby with Twitter fans|work=NewsComAu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He gave up drinking alcohol when he was 22 after deciding that it had become a bad influence in his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/none-for-the-road/2005/12/09/1134086810482.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap2|title=None for the road|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hughes is a keen supporter of the [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]] football team in the [[Australian Football League|AFL]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/afl/teams/carlton-coach-mick-malthouse-says-he-has-no-plans-to-make-up-with-collingwood-president-eddie-mcguire/story-e6frf9kx-1226610493885|title=My family were 'bitter' with Pies|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even asked the [[14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]] to bless Carlton: after doing so, the Dalai Lama commented: "It probably won't do much."&lt;ref name="DL" /&gt;

==Controversy==

During the 2007 [[Logie Awards]], which he co-hosted with [[Adam Hills]] and [[Fifi Box]], Hughes referred to radio shock-jock [[Kyle Sandilands]] as a "massive dickhead" to applause and laughter from the audience. Later that year, when interviewed on ''[[Enough Rope]]'' with [[Andrew Denton]], Sandilands said of Hughes, "I hate him – the next time I see him I'm going to punch him in the throat."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=22 August 2007 |title=Denton makes Kyle see red |work=NEWS.com.au |url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/story/0,23663,22284220-5000660,00.html |accessdate=27 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090820193234/http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/story/0%2C23663%2C22284220-5000660%2C00.html |archivedate=20 August 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hughes retorted by releasing an official apology, which said in part that Hughes was "sincerely and deeply sorry that Kyle Sandilands is a massive dickhead" and that "massive dickheads have the same rights as normal people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=24 August 2007 |title=Sorry you're a dickhead, Kyle |work=NEWS.com.au |url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/story/0,26278,22296659-10229,00.html |accessdate=27 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120909232734/http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/story/0,26278,22296659-10229,00.html |archivedate=9 September 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
