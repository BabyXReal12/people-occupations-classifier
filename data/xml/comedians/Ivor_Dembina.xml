'''Ivor Joseph Dembina''' (born 14 April 1951) is a British stand-up comedian and writer in the alternative tradition from London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ivor Dembina review|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2010/mar/25/ivor-dembina-review|website=The Guardian Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Dembina attributed his early "reputation for generally doing some decent gigs" to having "the brains to make sure there is a microphone facing the right way."&lt;ref name=Venables170711/&gt;

In 1987, together with club promoter, [[Addison Cresswell]], he founded the Comedy Boom venue at the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] in the basement of the Abercraig Lounge. It was the Edinburgh Festival Fringe's first venue that exclusively hosted stand-up comedy, and ran for five years.&lt;ref name=Venables170711/&gt;

After that, his career veered towards performance. He created and compèred a show called Comic Abuse at [[Pleasance Courtyard]] in the late 80s, which became a successful fixture and introduced acts such as [[Jo Brand]] and [[Jack Dee]].&lt;ref name=Venables170711/&gt;

Dembina runs the Hampstead Comedy Club in North London, which he founded in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Comedian Ivor Dembina on how money and TV altered British alternative comedy.|url=http://thejohnfleming.wordpress.com/2014/03/10/comedian-ivor-dembina-on-how-money-tv-altered-british-alternative-comedy/|website=John Fleming's Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is cited as an early influence by [[Stewart Lee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=Stewart|title=How I escaped my certain fate : the life and deaths of a stand-up comedian|date=2010|publisher=Faber and Faber|location=London|isbn=978-0-571-25480-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote for the first season of the [[Omid Djalili]] Show on BBC1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Omid Djalili Show Cast and Crew|url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/the_omid_djalili_show/details/|website=British Comedy Guide|accessdate=31 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He appeared in the first season of Eye Spy as 'Jewish Dad' on [[Channel 4]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eye Spy Cast and Crew|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3002664/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast|website=Internet Movie Database (IMDb)}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first stand-up comedian to perform a solo comedy show at the UK [[Houses of Parliament]].&lt;ref name="Ivor Dembina Parliament Stand-Up"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ivor Dembina Parliament Stand-Up|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2010/mar/16/ivor-dembina-parliament-standup|website=The Guardian Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|title=Observations: A comic Strip in Westminster|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/comedy/features/observations-a-comic-strip-in-westminster-1923465.html|website=The Independent Newspaper|accessdate=31 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Dembina's comedy focuses on his [[Jewish]] background and his political outlook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Old Jewish Jokes 2014 review| url=http://www.wow247.co.uk/blog/2014/08/20/old-jewish-jokes/|website=The Scotsman Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt; He toured his show about the Israel-Palestine conflict, 'This is Not a Subject For Comedy', in [[Israel]] and on the West Bank.&lt;ref name="A perfect Subject for Comedy"&gt;{{cite web|title=A perfect Subject for Comedy| url=http://www.hanitzotz.com/culture/Dembina.htm|website=Hanitzotz Publishing House}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998 he wrote and performed a show entitled SadoJudaism in which he talked about the worlds of [[fetishism]] and [[prostitution]] through Jewish eyes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beats me what they see in sado- masochism| url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/beats-me-what-they-see-in-sado-masochism-1-861658|website=The Scotsman Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stewart Lee credits him for correcting his microphone technique during a new act competition in 1990, calling him "the [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] of comedy".&lt;ref name=Venables170711/&gt;

==Social activism==
Dembina has attracted attention for his outspoken anti-Zionist and socialist views.

In 2004, while on his way to perform stand-up comedy in Israel and the West Bank, Ivor was detained for several hours by Israeli police at [[Ben Gurion Airport]] after his name reportedly turned up on a list of "known radicals".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Comic detained in Israel|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2004/10/13/995/comic_detained_in_Israel|website=Chortle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Dembina organised a comedy event called "60 Years: What A State" on Israel's independence day, [[Yom Ha'atzmaut]]. Featuring [[Jeremy Hardy]], [[Mark Steel]], [[Reginald D Hunter]] and [[Shazia Mirza]], it was on the same evening a gala event organised by the [[Zionist Federation of Great Britain and Ireland|Zionist Federation]] at the Wembley Arena celebrated 60 years of the Israeli state. Ivor branded the gala's headliner, American comedian [[Jackie Mason]], a "bad Jewish joke", citing Mason's support for Israel and the fact that comedian [[Ray Hanania]], of Palestinian descent, had been dropped from supporting Mason on tour in 2002. Ivor said: "Never mind Israel not wanting to share Jerusalem with Palestinians, he won't even share a stage with one."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mason rapped for Zionist gigl|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2008/04/28/6697/mason_rapped_for_Zionist_gig|website=Chortle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Dembina threatened legal action and called for an investigation after a protester interrupted his Edinburgh Fringe preview show at a Jewish community centre in Golders Green, accusing him of performing a "tame version for a Jewish audience" and demanding that he reveal his anti-Israel views.&lt;ref name=demonstrators/&gt; Other activists picketed outside and handed out flyers.&lt;ref name=demonstrators&gt;{{cite web|title=Demonstrators picket comic’s Ivy House performance|url=http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/51991/ivor-dembinas-show-no-joke-protester|website=Jewish Chronicle Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ivor said afterwards: "In 25 years in Jewish comedy, during which I have performed both in Britain and abroad—including in Israel—this is the first time someone has attended a performance of mine with the apparent intention of sabotaging it."&lt;ref name=demonstrators/&gt;

In late 2013 and early 2014, Dembina joined other artists and writers including [[Nigel Kennedy]], [[Yasmin Alibhai-Brown]] and [[Mark Steel]] at St James's Church, Piccadilly for Bethlehem Unwrapped, a festival during the Christmas season that drew attention to the [[Israeli West Bank barrier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bethlehem Unwrapped|url=http://www.palestinecampaign.org/events/bethlehem-unwrapped/|website=PSC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Dembina caused consternation among sections of the Jewish community for organising a benefit show for the people of the [[Gaza Strip]] with [[Daniel Kitson]], [[Josie Long]] and fellow Jewish comic [[Andy Zaltzman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FREE GAZA!|url=http://www.gildedballoon.co.uk/tickets/performances.php?eventId=14:599|website=Gilded Balloon Edinburgh Fringe Website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2014, he angered some other Jewish comedians by banning them from his from his club because they publicly endorsed and received payment from an organisation that he claimed was racist, the [[Jewish National Fund]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JNF Boycott|url=http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/126655/comedians-fall-out-over-israel-charity-boycott|website=Jewish Chronicle Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Racist Charity blacklisted|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/comedy/news/jewish-comics-blacklisted-over-support-for-racist-charity-9926891.html|website=The Independent Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Is the JNF Racist?|url=http://www.jewishnews.co.uk/jnf-racist/|website=The Jewish News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jewish Community Divided|url=http://www.beyondthejoke.co.uk/content/1297/news-jewish-comedy-community-divided-over-xmas-gig|website=Beyond the Joke blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The JNF Hit Back|url=http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/126839/jnf-hits-back-comedian-who-called-it-racist|website=Jewish Chronicle Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2015, he joined 700 other UK artists including [[Brian Eno]], [[Mike Leigh]] and [[Liz Lochhead]] as a signatory to a [[boycotts of Israel|cultural boycott of Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cultural Boycott of Israel|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/13/cultural-boycott-israel-starts-tomorrow|website=The Guardian Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Artists For Palestine|url=http://artistsforpalestine.org.uk/pledge-signatories/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Dembina also attracted the interest of the political community for his willingness to use sensitive subjects such as the Holocaust, Israel and Jewish stereotypes in his material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jewish Jokes Not Antisemetic|url= https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/jewish-jokes-are-not-antisemitic-if-told-in-good-faith-10050108.html|website=The Independent Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dembina is a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] member of the [[Vauxhall (UK Parliament constituency)|Vauxhall]] [[Constituency Labour Party]].&lt;ref name="jewishvoiceforlabour"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishvoiceforlabour.org.uk/jvl/a-jvl-statement-on-the-current-attacks-on-jeremy-corbyn/|title=A statement from Jewish Labour members on the current attacks on Jeremy Corbyn|publisher=Jewish Voice for Labour|date=26 March 2018|accessdate=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2016, he was one of 82 Jewish members and supporters of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and of [[Jeremy Corbyn]]'s [[Labour Party leadership of Jeremy Corbyn|leadership]] who wrote an open letter to ''[[The Guardian]]'' stating that they "do not accept that antisemitism is 'rife' in the Labour party" and that "these accusations are part of a wider campaign against the Labour leadership, and they have been timed particularly to do damage to the Labour party and its prospects in [[United Kingdom local elections, 2016|elections in the coming week]]."&lt;ref name="theguardian"&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/29/labour-antisemitism-and-where-jeremy-corbyn-goes-from-here|title=Labour, antisemitism and where Jeremy Corbyn goes from here|work= |location= |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|date=29 April 2016|accessdate=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
