In his memoir, ''[[Booky Wook 2]]'', Brand asserted that he and Morgan got into a row following Brand's controversial turn as the host of the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards (which the men co-wrote), and Morgan refused to return to the show.&lt;ref name=BW&gt;{{Citation  | first = Brand| last = Russell  | author-link = Russell Brand  | title = Booky Wook 2: This Time It's Personal  | place = London  | publisher = HarperCollins  | year = 2010  | page = 219  | isbn = 0-06-195807-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walker, Kirsty (29 October 2008), [http://www.endofshow.com/2008/10/29/brandandross/ "The Ross and Russ Suspension – EOS Sticks Its Oar In" – 12:05 pm.
