'''José Sánchez Mota''' (born June 30, 1965), better known as '''José Mota''', is a Spanish comedian and actor. He was member, with Juan Antonio Muñoz, of the comedy duo [[Cruz y Raya]] between 1989 and 2007 and later he made a solo career as a comedian.

== Cruz y Raya ==
[[File:Cruz y Raya.jpg|280px|right|thumb|Juan Muñoz (left) and José Mota (right), ''Cruz y Raya''.]]
In 1985, while he was serving in the military, Mota met [[Juan Antonio Muñoz]], whom he began his career as a comedian. The two started performing shows at small theaters in [[Madrid]], such as ''Cien personajes en busca de humor'' (''One Hundred Characters in the Quest of Humor''), but it was [[Javier Sardá]] who gave them the opportunity of making their own radio show, ''La Bisagra''. In 1989 they moved to television with the program ''[[Pero ¿esto qué es?]]'', in the Spanish public channel ([[La 1 (Spain)|La 1]]). The sketches were about a radio station, "''Cruz y Raya, the station that should, but never shuts up''". Later they were aired on [[Telecinco]] with the show ''Tutti Frutti'', and then came back to [[Televisión Española|TVE]] in order to replace the famous Spanish comedians [[Martes y Trece]] at several New Year's Eve special shows.

=== Other Works while at Cruz y Raya ===

Mota has also gave his voice to several characters in the Spanish dubbing of animation films such as ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'' and the ''[[Shrek]]'' films. In 2006 he adapted, along with [[Santiago Segura]], the Spanish version of ''[[The Producers (musical)|The Producers]]''. The comedian made [[cameo appearance]]s in TV shows such as ''[[7 vidas]]'' and ''Manolo y Benito Corporeision''.

=== Separation ===

After more than ten years fully dedicated to ''Cruz y Raya'', José and Juan decided to work in other projects on their own. In November 2007 the definitive separation of the famous couple was confirmed.

=== The José Mota Hour===
In 2009 before his separation with workmate Juan Antonio Muñoz, Jose Mota decided to make a new television show, ''[[La hora de José Mota]]''. The television show was aired on the Spanish State television ([[Televisión Española|TVE]]) on Fridays. He started to do another type of humor mixed by the latest he did. For example, he criticized bad Spanish and European politics, society and he did more imitations. Many sketches and their characters have become very famous in Spain. He has made impersonations of many public figures such as ''Bear Grylls'',''Woody Allen'' and ''Larry King'' as well as Spanish and international politicians like [[José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero]] (ZP) [[Mariano Rajoy]] and [[Angela Merkel|Merkel]] and [[Nicolas Sarkozy|Sarkozy]]. He also created new characters such as ''La Vieja'l Visillo'' (The Old Woman in the Window) or ''El Tío la Vara'' (The Man of the Rod). He has created several catchphrases such as ''behind the musgo'' (behind the moss), that is used in his ''[[Bear Grylls]]'' sketches.

In 2013 he created the sketch show ''[[La noche de José Mota]]'', very similar to the former, in the television channel [[Telecinco]]. The success of the new show was lower than expected, and it only lasted for one season (however, Mota said later that it had been planned that way from the beginning). In late 2014, it was confirmed that Mota was returning to TVE for their New Year's Eve special, which would be titled ''Un país de cuento'' ("A fairytale country") and that he would return in 2015 to [[La 1 (Spain)|La 1]] with a weekly show named ''José Mota presenta'', which premiered on February 20.
