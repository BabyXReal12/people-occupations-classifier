'''James Roderick Moir''' (born 24 January 1959), better known by the [[stage name]] '''Vic Reeves''', is an English [[comedian]], [[artist]], [[actor]] and [[television presenter]], best known for his [[double act]] with [[Bob Mortimer]] (see [[Vic and Bob]]). He is known for his [[surrealism|surreal]] and [[Non sequitur (literary device)|non sequitur]] sense of humour.

In 2003, Reeves and Mortimer were listed in ''[[The Observer]]'' as one of the 50 funniest acts in [[British comedy]]. In a 2005 poll to find the ''Comedians' Comedian'', Reeves and Mortimer were voted the 8th greatest comedy act ever by fellow [[comedian]]s and comedy insiders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4141019.stm | work=BBC News | title=Cook voted 'comedians' comedian' | date=2 January 2005 | accessdate=27 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
After school, Reeves undertook an apprenticeship in [[mechanical engineering]] at a factory in [[Newton Aycliffe]].&lt;ref&gt;CITATION NEEDED&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually he moved to London.

Reeves also formed the Fashionable Five, a group of five friends (including Jack Dent, who ran the original Fan Club) who would follow bands like [[the Enid]] and [[Free (band)|Free]] onto stage, and perform pranks (including Reeves pretending to have a [[brass]] hand, and following a [[Terry Scott]] lookalike around [[Darlington]] town centre in single file formation). Eventually, they formed their own band. Reeves had an early breakthrough with the help of comedian [[Malcolm Hardee]].

In 1983, Reeves began a part-time course at a local [[art college]], developed his love of [[painting]] and eventually persuaded a local [[art gallery]] to stage an [[Art exhibition|exhibition]] of his work. Although still primarily known as a [[comedian]], Reeves is gaining a reputation as an [[artist]]. His [[drawings]] and [[paintings]] have been used in his [[television shows]] and form a major part of his 1999 book, ''Sun Boiled Onions''.

===As Vic Reeves===
As well as working and performing in bands in London, including being an original member of the Industrial/Experimental band [[Test Dept]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Wilkinson|first = Roy|title=Mojo Eyewitness; Test Dept on the frontline of the Miner's Strike, 1984|newspaper=Mojo|pages=29–30|date=October 2015|accessdate=21 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and performing onstage with them at their debut gig (then leaving soon afterwards), Reeves also joined the [[alternative comedy]] circuit under many different guises. These included a loudmouthed American called Jim Bell, a [[beat poet]] called Mister Mystery and, eventually, "The North-East's Top [[Light Entertainment|Light Entertainer]]" – Vic Reeves. His stage show ''[[Vic Reeves Big Night Out]]'' began life as a regular Thursday night gig at Goldsmith's Tavern, [[New Cross]] (now the New Cross House). Here, he met [[Bob Mortimer]], a [[solicitor]] who attended the show and enjoyed it so much that he soon began to participate. Reeves' television début came in December 1986 on Channel 4 Television's ''[[The Tube (TV series)|The Tube]]'' in a comedy game show segment called "Square Celebrities", suspended by a wire to ask the "celebrities" questions. His next appearance was on the short-lived chat/comedy show ''One Hour with Jonathan Ross'' in a [[game show]] segment known as ''Knock Down Ginger''. Reeves' growing [[Television|TV]] profile led to ''[[Vic Reeves Big Night Out|Big Night Out]]'' being given a slot on [[Channel 4]] the following year. It was about this time that Reeves and Mortimer rented a back room at [[Jools Holland]]'s office/recording studio in [[Westcombe Park]], [[Greenwich]] where they would spend hours writing material.

The name Reeves is due to his fondness of the late American singer [[Jim Reeves]].

Reeves continued to work alongside Mortimer as a comedy duo in ''[[The Smell of Reeves and Mortimer]]'', ''[[Shooting Stars (TV series)|Shooting Stars]]'', and ''[[Bang Bang, It's Reeves and Mortimer]]'', some of which also featured future cast members of ''[[The Fast Show]]'' and ''[[Little Britain]]''.

Reeves is one of the few comedians to have had a number one record in the [[UK Singles Chart]], which he did in company with [[The Wonder Stuff]], singing "[[Dizzy (Tommy Roe song)|Dizzy]]" (previously a number one hit for [[Tommy Roe]]). Including "Dizzy", he released two other singles from his 1991 album ''[[I Will Cure You]]''.

A 1994 pilot written by [[Paul Whitehouse]] and [[Charlie Higson]] entitled ''The Honeymoon's Over'' was due to feature Chris Bell, a character from ''[[The Smell of Reeves and Mortimer]]''; however, the series was never commissioned. The same year, Reeves made a guest appearance on the Radio 1 series ''Shuttleworth's Showtime'', hosted by [[John Shuttleworth (character)|John Shuttleworth]].

Between August 1998 and May 1999, Reeves and Mortimer presented the [[Channel X]] produced [[BBC]] Saturday game show ''Families at War'' with [[Alice Beer]].

Reeves played [[Marty Hopkirk]] in the [[BBC]]'s 2000–2001 [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] series ''[[Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased) (2000 TV series)|Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased)]]'' – a revival of the [[Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased)|original 1960s series]], with Mortimer as [[Jeff Randall|Randall]], [[Emilia Fox]] as [[Jeannie Hopkirk|Jeannie]] and [[Tom Baker]] as Wyvern.

In 2000, Reeves presented a series entitled, ''Vic Reeves Examines'' on [[Play UK|UK Play]], featuring celebrities such as [[Ricky Gervais]], [[Johnny Vegas]], [[Lauren Laverne]] and [[Emma Kennedy]] discussing a topic of their choice. The same year, Reeves presented a one-off radio show on [[BBC Radio 1]], entitled ''Cock of the Wood''.

In 2004 Reeves and  Sorrell were both contestants in the fourth series of ''[[I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!]]''. He appeared in the series ''[[Catterick (TV series)|Catterick]]'' with mortimer appearing as several characters.

In September 2005, Reeves hosted a show for [[Virgin Radio]] called ''Vic Reeves Big Night In'' produced by Mark Augustyn, for a short period on Wednesdays and Thursdays from 7.00pm.

In May 2006, Reeves presented a programme on [[Tyne Tees Television|ITV Tyne Tees]] about Northeast comedy culture called ''It's Funny Up North with... Vic Reeves''.

Reeves presented a historical ten-part series, entitled ''Rogues Gallery'', which was shown on the [[Discovery Channel]] (UK) in 2005, where he investigated, and portrayed [[Anne Bonny]] and [[Mary Read]], [[William Kidd|Captain Kidd]], [[Claude Duval]], [[Jonathan Wild]], [[Robert Roy MacGregor|Rob Roy]], [[Thomas Blood|Colonel Blood]], [[The Aldington Gang|George Ransley]], [[William Brodie|Deacon Brodie]], [[Blackbeard]] and [[Dick Turpin]]. Sorrell also appeared in some episodes. Continuing in this vein, ''Vic Reeves' Pirates'' was shown on [[ITV Wales &amp; West|ITV West]] and, subsequently, on the [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]] in 2007.

In 2007, Reeves hosted a show called ''Vic Reeves Investigates: [[Jack the Ripper]]''. Reeves, with the help of historians and leading experts, tried to discover who Jack the Ripper was. At the end of the show, he came to the conclusion that Jack the Ripper was [[Francis Tumblety]].

On 8 May 2007, Reeves was the main presenter of ''[[Brainiac: Science Abuse]]'' during the fifth and sixth series, replacing [[Richard Hammond]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/5345812.stm BBC: Vic Reeves to host Sky's Brainiac]&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in June 2007, Reeves presented a [[BBC Radio 2]] panel game called ''[[Does the Team Think?]]''.

On 17 November 2007, Reeves appeared in a weekly sketch show on [[BBC Radio 2]], entitled ''[[Vic Reeves' House Arrest]]''. The show's premise was that Reeves had been put under [[house arrest]] for "a crime he didn't commit", and each episode consists of the various events that take place in and around his house on a particular day. Mortimer plays his housecall-making hairdresser, Carl, while other performers include ''[[The Mighty Boosh]]'' star [[Noel Fielding]] as a local vagrant who comes to Reeves' door on a weekly basis looking for work, as well as Sorrell in multiple roles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/comedy/vicreeves.shtml BBC – Radio 2 Comedy – Vic Reeves' House Arrest&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 February 2008, Reeves announced that he and Mortimer were working together on a new sitcom about super heroes who get their powers through a malfunctioning telegraph pole.&lt;ref name=Journal&gt;{{cite web

| accessdate=28 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also reiterated his desire to bring back ''[[Shooting Stars (TV series)|Shooting Stars]]'' for a 6th series. Along with his son, Reeves is also featured in one edition of a factual series for [[Channel 5 (UK)|Five]], ''Dangerous Adventures for Boys'', based on the best-selling book written by [[Conn Iggulden|Conn and Hal Iggulden]], ''[[The Dangerous Book for Boys]]''.

In February 2009, Reeves appeared as presenter of the first episode of ''My Brilliant Britain'', one of the new television shows commissioned for [[UKTV People]] channel's relaunch as [[Blighty (TV channel)|Blighty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Art==
Alongside his comedy, Reeves is a serious artist, although the two often combine. Reeves works in many media including painting, ceramics, photography and lino prints, and has a distinctive style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eyestorm.com/Pages/Magazine.aspx/VIC_REEVES___%7C___NEW_LINO_CUT_PRINTS/373 |title=Vic Reeves' lino cut prints}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work has been described as [[Dada]]-esque, surreal and sometimes macabre. For Reeves, his art and comedy are different ways of expressing the same idea. He says "I think putting your imagination on canvas or a television screen is the same thing"&lt;ref name="Strand"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://thestrandgallery.wordpress.com/2013/02/05/coming-up-hot-valve-leak-visual-ramblings-of-vic-reeves |title=Hot Valve Leak at the Strand Gallery}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "I don't differentiate between painting, acting or comedy. I think everything I do is art."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-kent-13060135 |title=Vic Reeves puts 250 artworks on sale}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reeves has stated that he is an artist first and a comedian second, and that in ten years time he would like to be remembered for his art and writing, rather than his comedy.&lt;ref name="Strand" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Curious" /&gt;

Much like his comedy, Reeves is not one to analyse his artworks. He has said that art should be "just for laughs"&lt;ref name="SOP 254" /&gt; and that he dislikes people looking for statements in his work, because there are none. "If something makes me laugh, that's it."&lt;ref name="Having a laugh"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Burkeman|first1=Oliver|title=Having a laugh|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2000/sep/28/artsfeatures3|accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; "I've done straight drawings and paintings ... and I haven't got as much pleasure out of them as if I'd done something that would make me laugh."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Leo|first1=Benedictus|title=When something goes down the pan, enjoy it|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/jun/05/biography.comedy|accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work has been described by artists [[Jake and Dinos Chapman]] as "able to command our laughter as a purgative, to encourage the viewer to leak at both ends".&lt;ref name="Call Me Dada"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Baker|first1=Lindsay|title=Call Me Dada|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2002/jun/22/artsfeatures.features2|accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artist [[Damien Hirst]], a friend of Reeves', has also described Reeves as an influence.&lt;ref name="SOP 254"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thompson|first1=Ben|title=Sunshine On Putty|date=2004|publisher=Harper Perennial|location=London|isbn=0 00 718132 9|page=254}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dessau|first1=Bruce|title=Reeves &amp; Mortimer|date=1998|publisher=Orion Media|location=London|isbn=0-75281-781-7|page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; This crossover of comedy and art often features within Reeves and Mortimer's television shows. A notable example is ''[[The Smell of Reeves and Mortimer]]'''s first episode. Several of Reeves' drawings are featured, illustrating the lyrics of the opening song. (These drawings would later be published within his book ''Sun Boiled Onions''.) As seen in the script book for the show, Reeves often drew sketches for the BBC's costume and set designers saying that "if we just tell them what we want, it never ends up looking like it does in our minds".&lt;ref name="GQ 1" /&gt;

===Background and education===
Arts and crafts played a large part in Reeves' upbringing. His mother and father, a [[seamstress]] and [[typesetting|typesetter]] by trade, made extra money by selling handmade wooden crafts and [[Ceramic art|ceramics]] at local markets.&lt;ref name="M:M 171-172"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reeves|first1=Vic|title=Me: Moir|date=2006|publisher=Virgin|location=London|isbn=1-85227-350-X |pages=171–172}}&lt;/ref&gt; Building on these money-making schemes, Reeves began charging for his own artistic services such as customising and painting his school friend's [[Haversack]] bags&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reeves|first1=Vic|title=Me: Moir|date=2006|publisher=Virgin|location=London|isbn=1-85227-350-X |pages=133–134}}&lt;/ref&gt; and elaborately [[Embroidery|embroidering]] clothing.&lt;ref name="M:M 171-172" /&gt; Later he would go on to [[Art forgery|forge]] artworks his acquaintances liked with the aim of selling them to them.&lt;ref name="Having a laugh" /&gt; Wanting to study art, but being pressured into work, Reeves began a five-year [[engineering]] [[apprenticeship]] at a factory in [[Newton Aycliffe]] with the aim of working in their technical drawings department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reeves|first1=Vic|title=Me: Moir|date=2006|publisher=Virgin|location=London|isbn=1-85227-350-X |pages=213–214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After completing the apprenticeship, Reeves applied to [[Goldsmith's College]] in London to study art, but failed to get a place. He has admitted to sneaking in and using their equipment regardless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thompson|first1=Ben|title=Sunshine On Putty|date=2004|publisher=Harper Perennial|location=London|isbn=0 00 718132 9|page=253}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983 he completed a one-year foundation course at [[Sir John Cass College]], where he is now an honorary graduate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hot Valve Leak|url=http://www.thecass.com/news-events/2013/february/hot-valve-leak|accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once leaving college, he worked as a curator at The Garden Gallery, an independent London gallery. It was there that he held his first art exhibition in 1985, with the help of a grant from [[Lewisham]] Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dessau|first1=Bruce|title=Reeves &amp; Mortimer|date=1998|publisher=Orion Media|location=London|isbn=0-75281-781-7|pages=31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Published work and exhibitions===
Reeves has released two books of his art, ''Sun Boiled Onions'' in 1999 and ''Vic Reeves' Vast Book of World Knowledge'' in 2009. His drawings also appear in his autobiography ''Me:Moir Volume One'', and the published script book for ''The Smell of Reeves and Mortimer''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Smell of Reeves and Mortimer|date=1993|publisher=Fantail Books|location=London|isbn=0-14-090012--8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reeves|first1=Vic|title=Me: Moir|date=2006|publisher=Virgin|location=London|isbn=1-85227-350-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; He provided thirty illustrations for [[Random House]]'s 2011 reprint of [[Jerome K. Jerome]]'s classic story "Three Men in a Boat".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jerome|first1=Jerome K.|title=Three men in a boat: to say nothing of the dog!|date=2011|publisher=Vintage Books|location=London|isbn=9780099511700}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also commissioned to create several celebrity drawings for [[Jools Holland]]'s [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] series "Name That Tune".&lt;ref name="GQ 1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ben|first1=Thompson|title=Viva! Las Degas|journal=GQ|date=December 1997|page=216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reeves has hosted several exhibitions of his artwork, including:
*''Sun Boiled Onions'' (2000) at the Percy Miller Gallery&lt;ref name="Having a laugh" /&gt;
*''Doings'' (2002) at the [[Whitechapel Gallery]], London&lt;ref name="Curious"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Walsh|first1=John|title=Funny peculiar: The curious world of Vic Reeves|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/comedy/features/funny-peculiar-the-curious-world-of-vic-reeves-1792545.html|accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*''Hot Valve Leak: Visual Ramblings of Vic Reeves'' (2013) at the Strand Gallery, London&lt;ref name="Strand" /&gt;

In 2010, a selection of Reeves' paintings were displayed at the [[Saatchi Gallery]], London as part of an exhibition by charity The Art of Giving. He was also a judge for the charity's open art competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Art of Giving: Vic Reeves|url=http://www.artofgiving.co.uk/artists/r/vic-reeves/|accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Reeves took part in the Illuminating York festival. His illuminations, known as "Wonderland", were projected across a number of historic buildings including the [[Yorkshire Museum]], [[St Mary's Abbey, York|St Mary's Abbey]], and the ten-acre site of [[York Museum Gardens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Illuminating York 2012|url=http://illuminatingyork.org.uk/the-main-events-2/kippa-matthews-copyright-notice-4|accessdate=3 February 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150204053554/http://illuminatingyork.org.uk/the-main-events-2/kippa-matthews-copyright-notice-4/|archivedate=4 February 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rychlikova|first1=Megi|title=Illuminating York set to launch Vic Reeves’ surreal wonderland|url=http://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/10017372.Illuminating_York_set_to_launch_Vic_Reeves____surreal_wonderland/|accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==

Before finding fame with his comedy, Reeves was a member of several bands with many different names and musical styles, in which he usually played bass guitar and/or sang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reeves|first1=Vic|title=Me:Moir Volume One|date=2006|publisher=Virgin Books|location=London|isbn=1 8522 7350 X|page=205}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He sold tapes of his early material in the back pages of [[NME]] magazine under the name "International Cod".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Taylor|first1=Neil|title=Document and Eyewitness: An Intimate History of Rough Trade|date=2010|publisher=Orion Publishing|isbn=978-1-4091-1221-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lqQbgGhFCr8C|accessdate=16 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dessau|first1=Bruse|title=Reeves &amp; Mortimer|date=1998|publisher=Orion Books|location=London|isbn=0-75281-781-7|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Lamarr]], later to become team captain of [[Shooting Stars (TV series)|Shooting Stars]], was sent an early tape of Reeves’ band "Fantantiddlyspan",&lt;ref name="Bruce Dessau book"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dessau|first1=Bruce|title=Reeves &amp; Mortimer|date=1998|publisher=Orion Books|location=London|isbn=0-75281-781-7|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose song "Fantasia" was played on ''[[Never Mind the Buzzcocks]]'' by Lamarr in 1998, in an attempt to embarrass him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Never Mind the Buzzcocks |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbCALj4gsY8 |accessdate=16 January 2015 |series=4 |number=1 |date=11 September 1998 |network=[[BBC Two]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of early [[Vic Reeves Big Night Out|''Big Night Out'']] performances, Reeves would sometimes hand out promotional materials to the audience. On one occasion he handed out a 7" [[flexi disc]] of original song "The Howlin’ Wind".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dessau|first1=Bruse|title=Reeves &amp; Mortimer|date=1998|publisher=Orion Books|location=London|isbn=0-75281-781-7|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having surplus copies of the discs, Reeves passed them on to [[Darlington]]-based band Dan who then included a copy of the disc with their album ''Kicking Ass at T.J.'s''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dessau|first1=Bruse|title=Reeves &amp; Mortimer|date=1998|publisher=Orion Books|location=London|isbn=0-75281-781-7|pages=103–104}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.discogs.com/Dan-Kicking-Ass-At-TJs/release/1160627 |accessdate=16 January 2015 |title=Dan album, Kicking Ass at T.J.'s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Album===
''[[I Will Cure You]]'' was Reeves' only album. It was released in 1991 by [[Island Records]] and peaked at No. 16 in the [[UK Albums Chart]]. It featured the Number One single "[[Dizzy (Tommy Roe song)|Dizzy]]" which was a collaboration with [[The Wonder Stuff]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discogs.com/Vic-Reeves-I-Will-Cure-You/release/1787467 Discogs]&lt;/ref&gt; It included a mixture of covers and original songs in a variety of musical styles, many of which were originally introduced in [[Vic Reeves Big Night Out|''Big Night Out'']]. Along with "Dizzy", two other singles were released from the album, a cover of the [[Matt Monro]] song "[[Born Free (Matt Monro song)|Born Free]]" and a dance reworking of [[Christian]] [[hymn]] "[[Abide With Me]]" which reached No. 6 and No. 47 in the [[UK Singles Chart]] respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/search-results-album/_/born+free |title=Born Free chart position |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150202021942/http://www.officialcharts.com/search-results-album/_/born+free |archivedate=2 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Singles===
{{For|singles released from ''I Will Cure You''|I Will Cure You#Singles}}
In 1995, Reeves and Mortimer released a cover of [[The Monkees]] song "[[I'm a Believer]]" with British band [[EMF (band)|EMF]] which reached No. 3 in the [[UK Singles Chart]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/emf/reeves%20%26%20mortimer/ |accessdate=16 January 2015 |title=Official charts, I'm a Believer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reeves had a history with the track, having both sung it at the beginning of early ''[[Vic Reeves Big Night Out|Big Night Out]]'' performances in London, and opened the [[Channel 4]] series with it.&lt;ref name="Working with EMF"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dessau|first1=Bruse|title=Reeves &amp; Mortimer|date=1998|publisher=Orion Books|location=London|isbn=0-75281-781-7|page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the music video, which was directed by Reeves,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mvdbase.com/video.php?id=9686 |accessdate=16 January 2015 |title=I'm A Believer, cast and crew}}&lt;/ref&gt; the duo dress as [[Michael Nesmith|Mike Nesmith]] and [[Davy Jones (musician)|Davy Jones]] of The Monkees.&lt;ref name="Working with EMF" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9un6gdY8-Fk |accessdate=16 January 2015 |title=Music video: I'm A Believer}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the CD release of the single, a studio version of "At This Stage I Couldn't Say" was included, a track originally sung by characters Mulligan and O’Hare in ''[[The Smell of Reeves and Mortimer]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.discogs.com/EMF-Reeves-Mortimer-Im-A-Believer/release/2371678 |accessdate=16 January 2015 |title=Discogs: I'm A Believer CD}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the 7" release, the bonus track was "At Least We’ve Got Our Guitars", which was the opening song for the last episode of ''The Smell of Reeves and Mortimer''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.discogs.com/EMF-Reeves-Mortimer-Im-A-Believer/release/3175318 |accessdate=16 January 2015 |title=Discogs: I'm A Believer 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2007, the theme to British stop-motion animation ''[[Shaun the Sheep]]'', sung by Reeves, was released as a single.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Walters|first1=Sarah|title=Shaun The Sheep Ft Vic Reeves - Life's A Treat (Tug)|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/whats-on/music/shaun-the-sheep-ft-vic-reeves-1013359|accessdate=24 March 2017|work=Manchester Evening News|date=7 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song reached No. 20 in the UK Singles Chart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/shaun%20the%20sheep |accessdate=16 January 2015 |title=UK Singles Chart, Shaun the Sheep theme}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contributions===

In 1990 both Reeves and Mortimer contributed backing vocals to [[Jools Holland]]'s "Holy Cow" (a [[Lee Dorsey]] cover). The track was included on Holland's album ''World of his Own'' and also released as a single.&lt;ref name="Reeves musical contributions"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dessau|first1=Bruse|title=Reeves &amp; Mortimer|date=1998|publisher=Orion Books|location=London|isbn=0-75281-781-7|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.discogs.com/Jools-Holland-Holy-Cow/release/4619700 |accessdate=16 January 2015 |title=Discogs, Holy Cow}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Reeves would advertise Holland's album ''Moving Out to the Country''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7X6FCiazhw |accessdate=16 January 2015 |title=Advert, Moving Out to the Country}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1990, Reeves provided backing vocals for former [[The Smiths|Smiths]] singer [[Morrissey]]'s cover of "[[That's Entertainment (The Jam song)|That's Entertainment]]", originally by [[The Jam]].&lt;ref name="Reeves musical contributions" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Reeves on his new album"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maconie|first1=Stuart|title=Why does this man want to be a popstar?|journal=NME|date=6 April 1991|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reeves' vocals were not used in the final edit but he was thanked (as Jim Moir) in the sleeve notes of Morrissey's [[Sing Your Life]] single, which featured "That's Entertainment" as a bonus track.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goddard|first1=Simon|title=Mozipedia: The Encyclopaedia of Morrissey and the Smiths|date=2009|publisher=Ebury Publishing|pages=347–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AV media notes |title=Morrissey, Sing Your Life credits |year=1990 |type=CD sleeve notes |publisher=A and Son Music Ltd. |url=http://www.discogs.com/Morrissey-Sing-Your-Life/release/396936}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fan of the Smiths, Reeves opened some episodes of [[Vic Reeves Big Night Out|''Big Night Out'']] with covers of the band's songs including "[[Sheila Take a Bow]]" which he intended to include a cover of on his album ''[[I Will Cure You]]''. It did not make the final cut.&lt;ref name="Reeves on his new album" /&gt;

In 1992, Reeves contributed a track to ''[[Ruby Trax]]'', a compilation album released by ''[[NME]]'' magazine to commemorate 40 years of the publication. He covered the [[Ultravox]] song "[[Vienna (Ultravox song)|Vienna]]", but drastically altered the original lyrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.discogs.com/Various-Ruby-Trax-The-NMEs-Roaring-Forty/master/25429 |accessdate=16 January 2015 |title=Discogs: NME's Ruby Trax}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, Reeves contributed to ''[[Twentieth-Century Blues: The Songs of Noel Coward]]'', a tribute album featuring notable singers and bands such as [[Elton John]], [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], [[Robbie Williams]] and [[Paul McCartney]]. Reeves covered Coward's 1934 track "Don’t Put Your Daughter on the Stage Mrs. Worthington", which was arranged by [[David Arnold]] for the album. The song, described by Reeves as "sinister",&lt;ref name="Noel Coward article"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dalton|first1=Stephen|title=Carry On Camping|journal=NME|date=18 April 1998|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; was initially recorded with all original verses intact, but as the last included foul language, it was edited out of the final release.&lt;ref name="Noel Coward article" /&gt;

In 2000, Reeves’ cover of "[[Ain't That a Kick in the Head?]]" was featured as a bonus track on the theme single to the [[Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased) (2000 TV series)|''Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased)'']] series in which he starred. Reeves was originally to duet with [[Nina Persson]] (of [[the Cardigans]]), who provided vocals, but missed the final cut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lane|first1=Andy|title=Randall &amp; Hopkirk (Deceased): the files|date=2001|publisher=Boxtree|location=London|isbn=0-7522-2356-9|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; A shortened version of Reeves' cover also featured in the series itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased) |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj7EmxLNODc |accessdate=16 January 2015 |series=1 |number=5 |date=15 April 2000 |network=[[BBC One]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Reeves and Mortimer appeared in the music video for the single.

===Music videos===
{{For|music videos from I Will Cure You|I Will Cure You#Music videos}}

Other than the music videos for his own singles, Reeves has appeared in others.
