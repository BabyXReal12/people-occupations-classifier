'''Kenan Thompson''' ({{IPAc-en|'|k|i:|n|ə|n|}} born May 10, 1978)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/celebrities/kenan-thompson/160421/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160727042434/http://www.tvguide.com/celebrities/kenan-thompson/160421/|title=Kenan Thompson|work=[[TV Guide]]|archivedate=July 27, 2016|accessdate=January 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an American actor and comedian. He has been a cast member of the [[NBC]] [[sketch comedy]] series ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' since 2003, and is the longest-tenured cast member in the show's history. In his teenage years, he was an original cast member of [[Nickelodeon]]'s sketch comedy series ''[[All That]]''. Thompson has also played Kenan Rockmore in the [[sitcom]] ''[[Kenan &amp; Kel]]'', Russ Tyler in ''[[The Mighty Ducks (film series)|The Mighty Ducks]]'' franchise, Dexter Reed in the 1997 film ''[[Good Burger]]'', and the title character in the 2004 film ''[[Fat Albert (film)|Fat Albert]]''. In his early career, he often collaborated with fellow comedian and ''All That'' cast member [[Kel Mitchell]]. He is ranked at #88 on [[VH1]]'s 100 Greatest Teen Stars.

==Early life and career==
Thompson was born and raised in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], to Fletcher and Elizabeth Ann Thompson. He has two siblings, an older brother and a younger sister. He began acting at age 15, appearing in the school play ''The Gingerbread Duck''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800022097/bio|title=Kenan Thompson Biography&amp;nbsp;– Yahoo! Movies&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He auditioned for a theatre company The Youth Ensemble of Atlanta (YEA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.myajc.com/news/entertainment/arts-theater/for-25-years-group-for-young-atlanta-performers-ha/nnC2K/|title=For 25 years, group for young Atlanta performers has mixed art, issues|last=Tuck|first=Angela|work=[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]|date=August 5, 2015|accessdate=March 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of his earliest roles was as an entertainment reporter for [[CNN]]'s "Real News for Kids",&lt;ref name=Film&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/4/Kenan-Thompson.html |title=Kenan Thompson Biography (1978–) |publisher=Filmreference.com |date= |accessdate=May 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he would go on to star in ''[[All That]]'', and ''[[Kenan &amp; Kel]]''.&lt;ref name=Film /&gt; While Kenan attended [[Tri-Cities High School]], a Visual and Performing Arts Magnet School in [[East Point, Georgia|East Point]], Georgia, he began filming his first movie, ''[[D2: The Mighty Ducks]]''.

==Film and television career==
Kenan has starred in several films including ''[[Good Burger]]'', based on the ''All That'' sketch of the same name, and ''[[Fat Albert (film)|Fat Albert]]'', in which he played the title character. He has also had supporting roles in the movies ''[[Heavyweights]]'', ''[[D2: The Mighty Ducks]]'', ''[[D3: The Mighty Ducks]]'', ''[[Love Don't Cost a Thing (film)|Love Don't Cost a Thing]]'', ''[[Barbershop 2: Back in Business]]'', ''[[My Boss's Daughter]]'', and ''[[Snakes on a Plane]]''. Thompson had a recurring role on ''[[The Steve Harvey Show]]'' as Junior, with co-star [[Kel Mitchell]].

In 2009, Thompson was a regular voice actor in the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] cartoon series ''[[Sit Down, Shut Up (U.S. TV series)|Sit Down, Shut Up]]'', portraying Sue Sezno, who, as evidenced by her last name, always says no.&lt;ref name="sdsu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sitdownshutupwiki.fox.com/?t=anon |title=Sit Down, Shut Up |publisher=Fox |accessdate=April 14, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417045348/http://sitdownshutupwiki.fox.com/?t=anon |archivedate=April 17, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The series premiered on April 19, 2009,&lt;ref name="sdsu"/&gt; but was canceled after only four episodes due to low ratings and less than favorable reviews. Thompson provided the voice for the LeBron James puppet in Nike's MVP "Most Valuable Puppets" commercials, which were produced to be shown throughout the 2009 NBA Playoffs. Thompson also guest starred on the [[USA Network]] TV show ''[[Psych]]'' in Season 4's "High Top Fade Out" (episode 7). He played an estranged college singing buddy of the character Gus. In 2011, he briefly returned to Nickelodeon, as he guest starred in [[iParty With Victorious|"iParty with Victorious"]], a crossover episode of TV sitcoms ''[[iCarly]]'' and ''[[Victorious]]''. 

Thompson appeared as a host of sorts of [[TeenNick|TeenNick's]] 1990's programming block, The '90s Are All That, appearing in many of the block's early bumpers and hyping material. He would return to the block, now called [[NickSplat]] but at the time called The Splat, for All That's 22nd anniversary, with segments filmed at the 2015 [[New York Comic-Con]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eonline.com/news/751120/an-all-that-reunion-is-coming-to-the-splat-this-is-vital-information-for-your-everyday-life|title=An All That Reunion Is Coming to The Splat—This Is Vital Information for Your Everyday Life|website=E! Online|first=Chris|last=Harnick|date=March 23, 2016|accessdate=July 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2015, Fandango announced that Thompson would play their brand character, fictional character Miles Mouvay. Thompson would play Mouvay in 18 videos, eight 30-second commercials, and a few comedic skits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fandango To Launch Brand Personality Series Starring Kenan Thompson|url=http://www.tubefilter.com/2015/10/30/fandango-miles-mouvay-kenan-thompson |work =Tubefilter|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 23, 2015, Thompson appeared on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon]]'' alongside former ''[[All That]]'' co-star [[Kel Mitchell]] in which they reprised their popular ''[[Good Burger]]'' roles as "Ed" and "Lester Oakes, Construction Worker".

==''Saturday Night Live''==
Thompson returned to sketch comedy when he joined the cast of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in 2003, becoming the first ''SNL'' cast member to be born after ''SNL''{{'}}s premiere in 1975. Thompson was a featured player until 2005 (spanning the [[History of Saturday Night Live (2000–2005)#2003-2004 season|29th]] and [[History of Saturday Night Live (2000–2005)#2004-2005 season|30th]] seasons) and was promoted to repertory player at the beginning of [[History of Saturday Night Live (2000–2005)#2005-2006 season|season 31]] (the 2005–2006 season).

Thompson has been a cast member on ''SNL'' for 15 seasons, breaking the record for the longest-tenured cast member in the show's history previously held by [[Darrell Hammond]], who was on the show for 14 seasons. Thompson became the most senior cast member in the [[Saturday Night Live (season 39)|2013–14 season]], following the departure of [[Seth Meyers]]. He is also the longest-serving African-American cast member, surpassing [[Tim Meadows]], who stayed on the show for ten seasons, and is also the second-oldest current cast member after [[Leslie Jones (comedian)|Leslie Jones]] (born 1967).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://splitsider.com/2013/05/report-fred-armisen-is-leaving-snl-too-jason-sudeikis-probably/|title=Fred Armisen Is Leaving 'SNL' Too, Jason Sudeikis "Probably"|date=16 May 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thompson also holds the record for most celebrity impressions performed on the show, performing 129, beating Hammond's previous record of 107.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snlarchives.net/Cast/?KeTh “Saturday Night Live – Kenan Thompson“] SNLarchives.net.
