'''Margaret Moran Cho''' ({{Korean|hangul=[[wikt:조모란|조모란]]|hanja=[[wikt:趙牡丹|趙牡丹]]}}; born December 5, 1968)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dong, Lan|page=224|title=Asian American Culture: From Anime to Tiger Moms|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2016|isbn= 978-1-440-82921-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an American stand-up comedian, actress, [[fashion design]]er, author, and [[singer-songwriter]]. Cho is best known for her [[Stand-up comedy|stand-up routines]], through which she critiques social and political problems, especially regarding [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] and [[Human sexuality|sexuality]]. She rose to prominence after creating and starring in the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] sitcom ''[[All-American Girl (1994 TV series)|All-American Girl]]'' (1994–95), and became an established stand-up comic in the subsequent years.

She has also had endeavors in fashion and music, and has her own clothing line. Cho has also frequently supported [[LGBT rights in the United States|LGBT rights]] and has won awards for her humanitarian efforts on behalf of women, [[Asian Americans]], and the [[LGBT]] community.

As an actress, she has acted in such roles as Charlene Lee in ''[[It's My Party (film)|It's My Party]]'' and [[John Travolta]]'s [[FBI]] colleague in the action movie ''[[Face/Off]].'' Cho was part of the cast of the TV series ''[[Drop Dead Diva]]'' on Lifetime Television, in which she appeared as Teri Lee, a [[paralegal]] assistant. In 2012 she was nominated for an [[Emmy Award]] for her guest starring role as Dictator [[Kim Jong-il]] on ''[[30 Rock]]''.

==Early life==
Cho was born into a [[Korean American|Korean]] family in [[San Francisco]], [[California]]. She grew up in a racially diverse neighborhood in the 1970s and 1980s, which she described as a community of "old [[Hippy|hippies]], ex-druggies, burn-outs from the 1960s, [[drag queen]]s, [[Chinese American|Chinese people]], and [[Korean American|Koreans]]. To say it was a melting pot — that's the least of it. It was a really confusing, enlightening, wonderful time."&lt;ref name=officialbio&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.margaretcho.com/content/bio/ | title= Bio| publisher=Margaret Cho official site| accessdate=September 20, 2008| archivedate= April 9, 2014| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140409075155/http://margaretcho.com/bio/| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cho's parents, Young-Hie and Seung-Hoon Cho,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/43/Margaret-Cho.html |title=Margaret Cho Biography |accessdate=2007-12-29 |work=FilmReference.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; ran Paperback Traffic, a bookstore on Polk Street at [[California Street (San Francisco)|California Street]] in San Francisco. Her father writes joke books and a newspaper column in [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800247891/bio |title=Margaret Cho Biography |publisher=Yahoo! Movies }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a child, Cho was bullied, saying that "I was hurt because I was different, and so sharing my experience of being beaten and hated and called ugly and fat and queer and foreign and perverse and gluttonous and lazy and filthy and dishonest and yet all the while remaining invisible heals me, and heals others when they hear it — those who are suffering right now."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/margaret-cho/it-gets-better_2_b_1294023.html|title=It Gets Better: How I Overcame Childhood Bullying|website=The Huffington Post|access-date=2016-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the ages of five and twelve, Cho was "sexually molested by a family friend".&lt;ref name="billboard"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6678375/margaret-cho-sexual-abuse-bullying-psycho-comedy-tour-album-robin-williams-joan-rivers|title=Margaret Cho Gets Deep About Past Sexual Abuse: 'All I Have Is Ownership of My Own Suffering' (Exclusive Interview)|website=Billboard|access-date=2016-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; She often skipped class and got bad grades in ninth and tenth grades, resulting in her expulsion from [[Lowell High School (San Francisco)|Lowell High School]].&lt;ref name="billboard"/&gt; Cho said she was "raped continuously through my teenage years" (by another acquaintance), and that when she told someone else about it and her classmates found out, she received hostile remarks justifying it, including accusations of being "so ugly and fat" that only a crazy person would have sex with her.&lt;ref name="billboard"/&gt;

After Cho expressed an interest in performance, she auditioned and was accepted into the [[School of the Arts High School (San Francisco)|San Francisco School of the Arts]], a San Francisco public high school for the arts. While at the school, she became involved with the school's [[improvisational comedy]] group&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=As Nasty As She Wants to Be|url=http://www.margaretcho.com/articles/individual_articles/asian_week_article.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020221213500/http://margaretcho.com/articles/individual_articles/asian_week_article.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2002-02-21|first=Dann|last=McDorman|date=2001-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; alongside actors [[Sam Rockwell]] and [[Aisha Tyler]].

At age 15, she worked as a [[phone sex]] operator,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2015/11/11/margaret-cho-worked-as-phone-sex-operator-at-age-15/|title=Margaret Cho worked as a phone sex operator at age 15|date=2015-11-11|website=Fox News|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and she later worked as a dominatrix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/03/fashion/margaret-cho-sex-work.html|title=Margaret Cho Wants to Talk About Sex Work|first=Lily|last=Burana|date=November 4, 2015|publisher=|via=www.nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating from high school, Cho attended [[San Francisco State University]], studying drama; however, she did not graduate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Summers, Claude J.|p=72|title=The Queer Encyclopedia of Film &amp; Television|publisher=Cleis Press | year=2005|isbn= 978-1-573-44209-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===1994–97: Early stand-up and ''All-American Girl''===
After doing several shows in a club adjacent to her parents's bookstore, Cho launched a stand-up career and spent several years developing her material in clubs. Cho's career began to build after appearances on television and university campuses. In 1992, she appeared on the unsuccessful ''[[Golden Girls]]'' spin-off ''[[The Golden Palace]]'' in a small role. In 1994, Cho won the [[American Comedy Award]] for Best Female Comedian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://theenvelope.latimes.com/search/env-past-winners-search,0,1243372,results.formprofile?Query=margaret+cho&amp;selectsearch=pastwinners&amp;target=article&amp;Lib=turbine_cdb_lib%3Aresult_doc_id+result_doc_rank+document_id+cdb_num+cdb_01_txt+cdb_02_txt+cdb_03_txt+cdb_04_txt+cdb_01_num&amp;SortBy=COMPOSITE_RANK+desc&amp;PageSize=10&amp;Page=1&amp;MinCoarseRank=500&amp;QueryType=CONCEPT&amp;x=0&amp;y=0 | author = TheEnvelope.com | title = Margaret Cho search results | work=The Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, on ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]'', she discussed her nervousness about doing ''The Golden Palace'' and thanked the late [[Rue McClanahan]] for her help with rehearsing. She also secured a coveted spot as opening act for [[Jerry Seinfeld]]; at about this time, she was featured on a [[Bob Hope]] special, and was also a frequent visitor to ''[[The Arsenio Hall Show]].''&lt;ref name=adsample&gt;{{cite web|last=Tang |first=Jean |url=http://www.jademagazine.com/Ad_sample_large.html |title=No Laughing Matter – Margaret Cho sounds off on political correctness, Asians in the media, and defying her parents |publisher=Jade Magazine |date=October 2002 |accessdate=November 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That same year, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] developed and aired a sitcom based on Cho's stand-up routine. The show, titled ''[[All-American Girl (1994 TV series)|All-American Girl]],'' was initially promoted as the first show prominently featuring an East Asian family, although the short lived sitcom ''[[Mr. T and Tina]],'' which had starred [[Pat Morita|Noriyuki "Pat" Morita]] as Mr. T., preceded it by nearly two decades.

Cho has expressed subsequent regret for much of what transpired during the production of the show, specifically:
* After network executives, especially executive producer [[Gail Berman]], criticized her appearance and the roundness of her face, Cho starved herself for several weeks. Her rapid [[weight loss]], done to modify her appearance by the time the pilot episode was filmed, caused kidney failure.&lt;ref name=ITOTIW-NYDN&gt;{{cite news|title=Cho Tells A H'wood Horror Story|url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/1999-07-18/gossip/18119680_1_margaret-cho-abc-sitcom-all-american-girl-pounds-in-two-weeks|accessdate=11 June 2012|newspaper=New York Daily News|date=18 July 1999|author=George Rush|author2=Joanna Molloy|author3=Marcus Baram|author4=Marc S. Malkin|quote=Cho says executive producer Gail Berman [...] told her, "The network has a problem with the fullness of your face." Cho's dieting got so bad she lost 30 pounds in two weeks that she made a secret trip to an emergency room when her kidneys failed.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The show suffered criticism from within the U.S. East Asian community over its perception of [[Stereotype|stereotyping]]. Producers told Cho at different times during production both that she was "too Asian" and that she was "not Asian enough." At one point during the course of the show, producers hired a coach to teach Cho how to "be more Asian."&lt;ref name=adsample /&gt;
* Much of the humor was broad and coarse, and at times, stereotypical portrayals of her close Korean relatives and gay book-shop customers were employed.

The show was canceled after suffering from poor ratings and the effect of major content changes over the course of its single season (19 episodes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Anderson |first=Sam |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2136087/ |title=Saved by the Gong: The sitcom that turned Margaret Cho into a cultural hero |publisher=Slate |date=February 23, 2006 |accessdate=November 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the show's 1995 cancellation, Cho became addicted to drugs and alcohol. As detailed in her 2002 autobiography, ''[[I'm the One That I Want]],'' in 1995, her substance abuse was evident during a performance in [[Monroe, Louisiana]], where she was booed off the stage by 800 college students after going on the stage [[drunk]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asianweek.com/2001_11_09/feature.html Margaret Cho’s mix of raunch and self-help conquers America] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202150117/http://www.asianweek.com/2001_11_09/feature.html |date=February 2, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1995–2002: Stand-up, acting, and writing===
[[Image:MargaretChoSanFrancisco.jpg|upright|thumb|Cho doing stand-up in June 2005.]]
Though her career and personal life were challenging after the cancellation of the show, Cho eventually sobered up, refocused her energy, and developed new material. She hosted the [[Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve|''New Year's Rockin' Eve 95'']] show with [[Steve Harvey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Margaret Cho with Steve Harvey hosting New Year's Rockin' Eve 1995 |publisher=Hollywood.com |url=http://www.hollywood.com/tv/Dick_Clarks_New_Years_Rockin_Eve_95/5175998 |accessdate=2009-04-09 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Year's 1994 to 1995 on ABC|publisher=YouTube|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYw1MFdjMnw |accessdate=2009-04-09

In 1999, she wrote about her struggles with the show in her first one-woman show, ''[[I'm the One That I Want]].'' That year, ''I'm the One That I Want'' won [[New York (magazine)|''New York'' magazine]]'s Performance of the Year award and was named one of the Great Performances of the year by ''[[Entertainment Weekly]].''&lt;ref name=augsburg&gt;[http://www.augsburg.edu/news/news-archives/2000/00,10,24,cho.html Comedian Margaret Cho to perform at Augsburg College]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017050635/http://www.augsburg.edu/news/news-archives/2000/00%2C10%2C24%2Ccho.html |date=October 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Cho wrote and published an autobiographical book with the same title, and the show itself was filmed and released as a concert film in 2000. Her material dealt with her difficulties breaking into show business because of her ethnicity and weight and her resulting struggle with and triumph over body image issues and drug and alcohol addiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://thecelebritycafe.com/interviews/margaret_cho.html | title=Cho, Margaret – Comedienne, Actress | first=Dominick | last=Miserandino | publisher=The Celebrity Cafe | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828140756/http://thecelebritycafe.com/interviews/margaret_cho.html | archivedate=August 28, 2008 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cho also appeared in an episode of the [[Home Box Office|HBO]] comedy ''[[Sex and the City]]'s'' fourth season. The episode, titled "[[The Real Me (SATC episode)|The Real Me]]," first aired on June 3, 2001, and also guest-starred [[Heidi Klum]].

In 2004, the show ''Notorious C.H.O.'' (the title was derived from slain rapper [[The Notorious B.I.G.]]) dealt with the comedian having been reared in 1970s San Francisco and her [[bisexuality]]. After completing ''Notorious C.H.O.'', Cho made another stand-up film, ''Revolution,'' which was released in 2004, and subsequently work on her first self-written film in which she starred. ''[[Bam Bam and Celeste]],'' a low-budget comedy about a "[[fag hag]]" and her gay best friend, co-starred Cho's friend and co-touring act Bruce Daniels. The film premiered at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] in 2005. On Valentine's Day of 2004, Cho spoke at the [[Same-sex marriage|Marriage Equality]] Rally at the [[Sacramento, California|California State Capitol]]. Her speech can be seen in the documentary ''Freedom to Marry.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freedomtomarry.tv |title=Freedom to Marry |publisher=Turtle Time Productions |date= |accessdate=November 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whygaymarriage.com/singleimage.php/20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814095842/http://www.whygaymarriage.com/singleimage.php/20 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=August 14, 2007 |title=Margaret Cho Speaks |publisher=Whygaymarriage.com |date= |accessdate=November 7, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2005–2010: Other projects and television===
In 2005, Cho released her second book, ''I Have Chosen to Stay and Fight,'' a compilation of essays and prose about [[global politics]], human rights, and other topical issues. Cho launched a national book tour in support of the collection. An audio reading of the book was also released. A DVD of a live taping of her ''Assassin'' tour was released in conjunction with the book. The same year, Cho started promoting and touring with her new show, ''Assassin.'' The show became her fourth live concert film and premiered on the gay and lesbian premium cable network [[here TV|Here!]] TV in September 2005. In this DVD, she notably includes herself when talking about gays, saying "we" and "our community." Posters for ''Assassin'' featured Cho in paratrooper gear and holding a microphone in the style of an automatic rifle, a reference to the infamous 1974 photo of heiress [[Patty Hearst]].

Cho launched "The Sensuous Woman,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.margaretcho.com/sensuouswoman/index.html |title=The Sensuous Woman |publisher=Margaret Cho official site |accessdate=October 10, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071004212803/http://www.margaretcho.com/sensuouswoman/index.html |archivedate=October 4, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[American burlesque|burlesque]]-style variety show tour, in Los Angeles on August 10, 2007, with tour dates scheduled through November 3, as of October 10.&lt;ref name="sensuous_woman_tour"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://margaretcho.com/tour/tour.htm |title=The Sensuous Woman Tour Dates |publisher=Margaret Cho official site |accessdate=October 10, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070903151957/http://www.margaretcho.com/tour/tour.htm |archivedate=September 3, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scheduled tour stops meant to follow Los Angeles were Chicago, Illinois and New York City.&lt;ref name="sensuous_woman_tour"/&gt; On August 10, 2007 the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' reviewed the show, Cho's work, key events in her personal life and characterized the show thus: "In fact, as bawdy and bad-behaving as the cast gets, the whole show feels more like a crazy family reunion than a performance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/g/a/2007/10/10/apop.DTL | title=ASIAN POP / New tricks | first=Jeff | last=Yang | date=October 10, 2007 | publisher=San Francisco Chronicle | accessdate= October 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2007, Cho appeared in [[The Dresden Dolls]]' video of their song "[[Shores of California]]," which was [[Master of Ceremonies|MC]]ed by [[Amanda Palmer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awnjw36mNEs |title=The Dresden Dolls 'Shores of California' music video |publisher=YouTube |date=June 10, 2007 |accessdate=November 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[The Cliks]]'s video for "Eyes in the Back of My Head," in which she appeared as [[Lucas Silveira]]'s lover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVcvdXJN5no |title="Eyes in the Back of My Head" by The Cliks |publisher=YouTube |date=July 31, 2007 |accessdate=November 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also provided the character voice for a character named Condie Ling on the Logo animated series ''[[Rick &amp; Steve: The Happiest Gay Couple in All the World]].'' Her episodes began airing in 2007.

The premiere performance of Cho's "Beautiful" tour was on February 28, 2008, in Sydney, Australia as part of the [[Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras|Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras Festival]]. Cho was also the [[Grand Marshal|Chief of Parade]] for the festival's annual parade along [[Oxford Street, Sydney|Oxford Street]] on March 1. During her stay in Sydney, Cho was filmed shopping for parade outfits in a [[drag queen|drag]] store with [[Kathy Griffin]] and [[Cyndi Lauper]] for Griffin's Bravo series ''[[Kathy Griffin: My Life on the D-List|My Life on the D-List]].'' The episode featuring Cho aired on June 26, 2008.

Cho and her family and friends appeared in an episode of NBC's series ''[[Celebrity Family Feud]],'' which premiered on June 24, 2008. Later that summer, she appeared in her own semi-scripted reality sitcom for [[VH1]], ''[[The Cho Show]],'' which premiered on August 21, 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianweek.com/2008/09/04/asian-reality-what-were-watching-this-fall/ |title=What We’re Watching This Fall |work=[[AsianWeek]] |accessdate=September 15, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906014411/http://www.asianweek.com/2008/09/04/asian-reality-what-were-watching-this-fall/ |archivedate=September 6, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and lasted one season.

===2011–present: Further appearances and tours===
In April 2011, Cho guest starred on the comedy ''[[30 Rock]]'' in the episode "Everything Sunny All the Time Always." She portrayed [[Kim Jong-Il]], then the leader of North Korea, that required her to speak both Korean and English. She was nominated for a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.tv.com/30-rock/show/58326/viewer.html?flag=1&amp;i=1&amp;gri=58326&amp;grti=101 |title=Tina Fey – 30 Rock |publisher=TV.com |date=April 29, 2011 |accessdate=November 7, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807190159/http://www.tv.com/30-rock/show/58326/viewer.html?flag=1&amp;i=1&amp;gri=58326&amp;grti=101 |archivedate=August 7, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; She later returned to portray Kim Jong-Il's son, [[Kim Jong-Un]].{{Episode needed|date=September 2015}} In 2010, Cho was a contestant on the 11th season of ''[[Dancing with the Stars]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dos Santos |first=Kristin |url=http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/watch_with_kristin/b197540_dancing_with_stars_sources_confirm.html |title=Dancing With the Stars Sources Confirm Margaret Cho and Jennifer Grey—Guess Which One Gets Derek Hough? |publisher=E!

Also in 2011, online human rights awareness project America 2049 had Margaret appear as one of the main characters, whose videos were played as part of the main storyline. The Facebook-interfaced game uses a fictional, fractioned future in order to highlight today's social inequities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=America 2049 on Facebook |url=https://www.facebook.com/America2049?sk=app_10531514314 |publisher=Facebook.com |date= January 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since January 2013, Cho has been the co-host of the weekly podcast ''Monsters of Talk'' along with [[Jim Short (comedian)|Jim Short]]. Cho embarked on her "Mother" tour in the fall of 2013 and slated it for engagements in Europe in 2014. The title of the tour refers not to Cho's impressions of her own mother, but to Cho herself. It is her nickname for the figure she has played to her many gay friends over the years.{{sfn|Hagen, Paul, "Cho Must Go On," Metrosource, October/November 2013|p=30}} In 2014, she participated in ''[[Do I Sound Gay?]]'', a documentary film directed and produced by David Thorpe.  The film is about stereotypes of gay men's speech patterns.&lt;ref name=thr&gt;[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/do-i-sound-gay-toronto-731253 "'Do I Sound Gay?': Toronto Review"]. ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', 8 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comedic style and political advocacy ==
[[File:Margaret Cho at Los Angeles Pride - 20110612.jpg|upright|thumb|Cho at [[LA/Valley Pride|Los Angeles LGBT pride parade]] in 2011.]]
Cho is also well known for discussing her relationship with her mother, particularly in imitating her mother's heavily accented speech. Her depictions of "Mommy" have become a popular part of her routine. Cho's comedy routines are often explicit. She has covered substance abuse, [[eating disorder]]s, her bisexuality and obsession with gay men, and Asian-American stereotypes, among other subjects, in her stand-up routines.

A substantial segment of her material and advocacy addresses LGBT issues. In addition to her shows, Cho also developed an additional outlet for her advocacy with the advent of her website and her daily [[weblog]]. When San Francisco Mayor [[Gavin Newsom]] directed that San Francisco's city hall issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples in San Francisco in 2004 (until reversed by the state supreme court), Cho started ''Love is Love is Love,''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.loveisloveislove.com |title=Love is Love is Love |publisher=Love is Love is Love |date= |accessdate=November 7, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111124050042/http://www.loveisloveislove.com/ |archive-date=November 24, 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; a website promoting the legalization of [[gay marriage]] in the United States.

Cho's material often features commentary on politics and contemporary American culture. She has also been outspoken about her dislike of former President [[George W. Bush]]. She began to draw intense fire from [[Conservatism|conservatives]] over her fiercely anti-Bush commentary; a live performance in [[Houston]], Texas was threatened with picketing. Although protesters never showed up, she held a counter protest outside the club until security told her she had to go inside.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.margaretcho.com/blog/2004/02/06/protest-this.html ''Protest This'' an entry in Margaret's blog] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002000232/http://www.margaretcho.com/blog/2004/02/06/protest-this.html |date=October 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Cho was performing at a corporate event in a hotel when, after ten minutes, her microphone was cut off and a band was instructed to begin playing. Cho claims that this was because the manager of the hotel was offended by anti-Bush administration comments. Cho's payment, which was issued by way of check directly to a non-profit organization, a defense fund for the [[West Memphis Three]], initially [[Non-sufficient funds|bounced]] but was eventually honored.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.margaretcho.com/blog/2004/05/28/they-turned-off-the-mic.html ''They Turned Off the Mic'' an entry in Margaret's blog] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090310015724/http://www.margaretcho.com/blog/2004/05/28/they-turned-off-the-mic.html |date=March 10, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2004, during the [[Democratic National Convention]], Cho was disinvited to speak at a [[Human Rights Campaign]]/[[Stonewall Democrats|National Stonewall Democrats]] fundraiser out of fear that her comments might cause controversy. In November 2005, she campaigned to pardon [[Stanley Williams|Stanley Tookie Williams]], an early [[Crips]] gang leader, for his death sentence for four murders, but this campaign failed; on December 13, 2005, after exhausting all forms of appeal, Williams was executed by [[lethal injection]] at [[San Quentin State Prison]], California.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.margaretcho.com/blog/2005/10/26/save-tookie.html ''Save Tookie'' an entry in Margaret's blog] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Cho [[emcee|hoste]]d the multi-artist [[True Colors Tour 2007|True Colors Tour]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.truecolorstour.com/ |title=Tour Info |publisher=True Colors Tour |date= |accessdate=November 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which traveled through 15 cities in the United States and Canada.  The tour, sponsored by the [[Logo (TV channel)|Logo]] channel, began on June 8, 2007. Headlined by [[Cyndi Lauper]], the tour also included [[Debbie Harry]], [[Erasure]], [[The Gossip]], [[Rufus Wainwright]], [[The Dresden Dolls]], [[MisShapes|The MisShapes]], [[Rosie O'Donnell]], [[Indigo Girls]], [[The Cliks]], and other special guests.  Profits from the tour helped to benefit the [[Human Rights Campaign]] as well as [[PFLAG]] and The [[Matthew Shepard]] Foundation.

On January 25, 2008, Cho officially gave her support to [[Barack Obama]] for the nomination on the Democratic ticket for the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 U.S. presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/margaret-cho/americas-next-top-presid_b_83309.html |title=America's Next Top President |last=Cho |first=Margaret |date=2008-01-25 |work=[[Huffington Post]] |accessdate=2008-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[U.S. Republican Party|Republican]] Presidential candidate [[John McCain]] announced his running-mate, Governor [[Sarah Palin]] of [[Alaska]], Cho said of Palin, "I think [Palin] is the worst thing to happen to America since [[September 11, 2001 attacks|9/11]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washblade.com/2008/9-19/outindc/cover/13293.cfm |title=Honoring Cho |last=Cho |first=Margaret |date=2008-09-19 |work=[[Washington Blade]] |accessdate=September 19, 2008 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On an episode of ''[[The Hour (Canadian TV series)|The Hour]]'' with host [[George Stroumboulopoulos]], Cho mentioned that she loved [[Broken Social Scene]] and wishes to be a part of the band (offering to play the rainstick or the triangle).

* In 2015, [[Joan Juliet Buck]], writing in ''W'', called Cho a modern-day [[femme fatale]], writing:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[N]ot all women comedians are dangerous; some are just very funny: Tina Fey and Amy Poehler are too relatable, Joan Rivers was too firmly ensconced in the society that she mocked. Amy Schumer relies a little too much on the word "pussy" to be any kind of threat, though she would like very much to be a bad person. On the other hand, ... Margaret Cho know[s] no boundaries and inspire[s] palpable fear anytime [she] begin[s] one of [her] riffs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wmagazine.com/culture/2015/03/dangerous-women-femme-fatales/|title=No Guts, No Glamour|first=Joan Juliet|last=Buck|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
