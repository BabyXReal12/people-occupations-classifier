The target of bullies as a child,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2011/06/13/tracy-morgan-i-know-bullying-can-hurt/|work=Entertainment Weekly|publisher=Time Inc.|title=Tracy Morgan: 'I know bullying can hurt'|author=Lynette Rice|date=June 13, 2011|accessdate=December 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morgan attended [[DeWitt Clinton High School]].&lt;ref name=bowling /&gt; In 1985, at age 17 in his second year, he learned his father had contracted AIDS from hypodermic needle use.&lt;ref&gt;The Star Ledger. section 1. pg 20.

Morgan married his girlfriend Sabina that year &lt;!--1987--&gt; and dropped out of high school just four credits short of his diploma to care for his ailing father.&lt;ref name=bowling/&gt; Already raising their first son and living on welfare, Morgan sold [[crack cocaine]] with limited success,&lt;ref name="Fresh Air"/&gt; but began earning money performing comedy on the streets&lt;ref name=bowling/&gt; after his best friend was murdered. He said in 2009: "He would say to me, 'Yo, Tracy, man, you should be doing comedy.' A week later, he was murdered. And that for me, that was like my Vietnam. I had my survival [sic] guilt when I started to achieve success. Why I made it out and some guys didn't."&lt;ref name="Fresh Air"/&gt;

Morgan embarked on a stand-up comedy career, successfully enough that he "finally moved to a nice community in [the Bronx neighborhood of] [[Riverdale, The Bronx|Riverdale]], from a run-down apartment next to [[Yankee Stadium]] in the Bronx".&lt;ref name="Fresh Air"/&gt;

==Career==
Morgan made his screen debut playing Hustle Man on the television show ''[[Martin (TV series)|Martin]]''.

===Health problems===

====Diabetes, kidney transplant and alcohol abuse ====
In 1996, Morgan was diagnosed with [[diabetes]] and for years has struggled with alcohol abuse. With his consent, many of his own troubles were incorporated within ''30 Rock'' episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Dave |last=Itzkoff |title=For Tracy Morgan, Every Day Is a Show |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/02/arts/television/02itzk.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 28, 2008 |accessdate=March 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early December 2010, Morgan received a kidney transplant necessitated by his diabetes and alcohol abuse. Morgan admitted that he initially did not take his diabetes seriously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.ew.com/article/2010/12/20/tracy-morgan-surgery-30-rock| title=Exclusive: Tracy Morgan recovering from surgery, will miss several episodes of '30 Rock'| first=Lynette|last= Rice|work=Entertainment Weekly | publisher=Time Inc.| date= December 20, 2010| accessdate= December 6, 2015 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151119171722/http://www.ew.com/article/2010/12/20/tracy-morgan-surgery-30-rock| archivedate= November 19, 2015| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Traffic collision====
On June 7, 2014, Morgan was a passenger in a [[Mercedes-Benz Sprinter|Mercedes Sprinter]] [[minibus]] involved in a six-vehicle crash in New Jersey. Just after 1:00&amp;nbsp;am EDT Saturday morning, the vehicle was traveling northbound on the [[New Jersey Turnpike]] near [[Cranbury, New Jersey|Cranbury]], when it was struck from behind by a tractor-trailer operated by [[Walmart]],&lt;ref name=ChicagoTrib140607&gt;{{cite web|title=Georgia truck driver charged in crash that injured Tracy Morgan|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi-tracy-morgan-car-crash-20140607,0,1945423.story|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|accessdate=June 7, 2014|date=June 7, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140607215929/http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi-tracy-morgan-car-crash-20140607,0,1945423.story|archivedate=June 7, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; causing a [[Multiple-vehicle collision|chain reaction crash]].&lt;ref name="CNNcrash"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Joe Sutton|author2=Faith Karimi|title=Actor Tracy Morgan in critical condition after six-vehicle accident in New Jersey|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/06/07/showbiz/tracy-morgan-hospitalized/index.html?hpt=hp_t1|publisher=CNN|accessdate=June 7, 2014|date=June 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=complaint&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/sites/default/files/custom/Aaron/untitled%20folder/https-ecf-njd-uscourts-gov-doc1-11918990489.pdf |title=Morgan lawsuit against Walmart |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2014-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morgan and three other comedians, including [[Harris Stanton]], along with Morgan's assistant and two limousine company employees, were returning from an engagement at [[Dover Downs Hotel &amp; Casino]] in [[Dover, Delaware]], as part of Morgan's "Turn it Funny" stand-up comedy tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Actor Tracy Morgan in ICU After Crash|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/celebrity/actor-tracy-morgan-icu-after-crash-n125181|publisher=[[NBC]]|accessdate=June 7, 2014|date=June 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crash killed Morgan's friend and collaborator, 62-year-old comedian [[James McNair]].&lt;ref name="ChicagoTrib140607" /&gt;

Morgan was taken by helicopter to [[Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital]] in [[New Brunswick, New Jersey]], with a broken leg and femur, broken nose, and several broken ribs, and underwent surgery on his leg on June 8. He was in a coma for two weeks. &lt;ref name="ABC 14-6-11"&gt;{{cite web |title=Tracy Morgan 'More Responsive' Day After Crash, Rep Says |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/tracy-morgan-responsive-day-crash/story?id=24045450 |website=abcnews.go.com |publisher=[[ABC News]] |accessdate=June 11, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611040359/http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/tracy-morgan-responsive-day-crash/story?id=24045450 |archivedate=June 11, 2014 |deadurl=no |date=June 8, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 20, 2014, Morgan was released from the hospital and was transferred to a rehabilitation facility to continue recovering from the injuries sustained during the crash. He was released from the rehab center on July 12, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2014/07/12/tracy-morgan-lawsuit-walmart/12564059|title=Tracy Morgan released from rehab hospital|last=Deerwester|first=Jayne|date=July 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The driver of the Walmart transport-truck, Kevin Roper of [[Jonesboro, Georgia]], pleaded not guilty to one count of death by auto and four counts of assault by auto. The complaint alleges Roper dozed off and hit Morgan's limousine after swerving to avoid slowed traffic ahead of him.&lt;ref name="CBS 14-6-16"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tracy Morgan's condition improves|publisher=[[CBS News]]|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/tracy-morgans-condition-improves|accessdate=June 16, 2014|date=June 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also argues that Roper had been awake for more than 24 hours before the crash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2014/06/09/driver-in-tracy-morgan-crash-hadnt-slept-in-24-hours|title=Truck driver in Tracy Morgan crash hadn't slept in 24 hours|last=DeGregory|first=Priscilla|newspaper=[[New York Post]]|date=June 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A preliminary investigation by the [[National Transportation Safety Board]] revealed that Roper had been on the clock since 11:20 Friday morning and was very close to the federal limits of 14 hours per day and 11 hours behind the wheel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2014/06/tracy-morgan-crash-driver-kevin-roper-ntsb-108061.html|title=NTSB: Driver in Tracy Morgan crash had been working for 13 hours|last=Robillard|first=Kevin|newspaper=[[Politico]]|date=June 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 10, 2014, Morgan sued Walmart for negligence. The suit alleged that Walmart either knew or should have known that Roper hadn't slept for more than 24 hours. The complaint alleged that before his shift, Walmart forced Roper to drive from his home in Jonesboro to a Walmart distribution center in [[Smyrna, Delaware]]—a distance of some {{convert|750|mi|km}} over 11 hours—even though there were several other distribution centers within a much more reasonable driving distance. Morgan filed the suit on behalf of himself, comedian Ardie Fuqua, Morgan's personal assistant Jeffrey Millea, and Millea's wife Krista. Fuqua and Millea were both on the bus with Morgan and injured in the crash, while at the time of the crash, Krista Millea was eight months pregnant, and the suit charges that she suffered [[loss of consortium]] due to the injuries suffered by her husband.&lt;ref name="complaint" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2014/07/12/tracy-morgan-suing-walmart-for-deadly-nj-turnpike-crash|title=Tracy Morgan suing Walmart for fatal crash|last=Prendergast|first=Daniel|newspaper=[[New York Post]]|date=July 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/07/12/showbiz/tracy-morgan-crash-lawsuit/index.html|title=Tracy Morgan sues Walmart over deadly crash|publisher=CNN|date=July 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/tracy-morgan-sues-walmart-deadly-718146|title=Tracy Morgan Sues Walmart Over Deadly Crash|last=Couch|first=Aaron|newspaper=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=July 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2014, Walmart in court papers cast partial blame on Morgan and the other victims for not wearing seat belts, a claim both Morgan and his counsel denied, noting that the driver who caused the crash had been charged with [[vehicular homicide]] and that the police report stated that seat belts were not an issue in the case.&lt;ref name="seatbelts"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/tracy-morgan-wal-mart-blaming-injuries-article-1.1958406|title=Tracy Morgan: 'I can't believe Wal-Mart is blaming me for an accident that they caused'|first=Dareh|last=Gregorian|newspaper=Daily News | location = New York City| date=September 30, 2014|accessdate=September 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 1, 2015, Morgan made his first public appearance since the crash, in an interview with [[Matt Lauer]] on ''[[Today (U.S. TV series)|Today]]''. In that interview, he appeared lucid but said that "I have my good days and my bad days, where I forgot things", and that he also gets recurring headaches. He also stated that he had no memory of the crash. Morgan made a surprise appearance at the [[67th Primetime Emmy Awards]] on September 20, and was greeted with a standing ovation. He then hosted an episode of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' on October 17, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tracy Morgan Hilariously Pokes Fun at His Brain Damage in First 'SNL' Promos |url=http://www.etonline.com/news/173972_tracy_morgan_is_hilarious_pokes_fun_at_his_brain_damage_first_promos_for_saturday_night_live/ |publisher=Entertainment Tonight |first=Antoinette |last=Buono|date=October 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the November 3, 2016 episode of ''[[Conan (talk show)|Conan]]'', Morgan said that he was no longer angry about the collision and had forgiven Roper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/tracy-morgan-says-he-forgives-truck-driver-who-hit-him-news.25220.html? |title=Tracy Morgan says he forgives driver |last=Feig |first=Zakk |date=4 November 2016 |website=[[Hotnewhiphop]] |access-date=4 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==

On January 27, 2011, Morgan appeared on the ''[[NBA on TNT]]'' pregame coverage of the [[Miami Heat]] and the [[New York Knicks]] nationally-televised live basketball game. During the appearance, commentators [[Charles Barkley]] and [[Kenny Smith]] asked Morgan to choose between [[Sarah Palin]] and [[Tina Fey]] regarding who was better looking (Fey, Morgan's ''30 Rock'' co-star, portrays Palin on ''Saturday Night Live''). Morgan said Palin was "good masturbation material", for which TNT apologized on live camera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tracy Morgan Calls Sarah Palin 'Good Masturbation Material,' Network Apologizes |publisher=[[Fox News]] |date=January 28, 2011 |url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2011/01/28/tracy-morgan-calls-palin-good-masturbation-material-network-apologizes/ |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6dZzehufM?url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2011/01/28/tracy-morgan-calls-palin-good-masturbation-material-network-apologizes/ |archivedate=December 6, 2015 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a performance in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], Tennessee, on June 3, 2011, Morgan made remarks about homosexuals, reportedly stating that if his son were gay, his son better speak to him like a man or he would "pull out a knife and stab him". Morgan apologized, saying that he had "gone too far."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Oldenburg |first=Ann |url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/entertainment/post/2011/06/tina-feytracy-morgan-is-not-a-hateful-man/1 |title=Tina Fey:Tracy Morgan is 'not a hateful man' |work=[[USA Today]] |date=June 12, 2011 |accessdate=September 26, 2011 |archivedate=December 6, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6dZzVAtp4?url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/entertainment/post/2011/06/tina-feytracy-morgan-is-not-a-hateful-man/1 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; NBC Entertainment head Bob Greenblatt stated, "I speak for NBC and myself personally when I say we do not condone hate or violence of any kind, and I am pleased to see Tracy Morgan apologizing for recent homophobic remarks in his standup appearance... Unfortunately, Tracy's comments reflect negatively on both ''30 Rock'' and NBC – two very all-inclusive and diverse organizations – and we have made it clear to him that this kind of behavior will not be tolerated." Tina Fey, Morgan's boss both in fiction and in real life, said, "I'm glad to hear that Tracy apologized .... but the violent imagery of Tracy's rant was disturbing to me at a time when homophobic hate crimes continue to be a life-threatening issue for the LGBT community...the Tracy Morgan I know, ...is not a hateful man and [would never] hurt another person. I hope for his sake that Tracy's apology will be accepted as sincere by his gay and lesbian co-workers at ''30 Rock'', without whom Tracy would not have lines to say, clothes to wear, sets to stand on, scene partners to act with or a printed-out paycheck from accounting to put in his pocket."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title='30 Rock's' Tina Fey and NBC honcho Bob Greenblatt respond to Tracy Morgan's homophobic comments |date=June 10, 2011 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2011/06/30-rocks-tina-fey-and-nbc-honcho-bob-greenblatt-respond-to-tracy-morgans-homophobic-comments.html |first=Yvonne|last= Villarreal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 25, 2011, during a show at [[Caroline's on Broadway|Caroline's]] in New York City, Morgan made comments about disabled children, saying; "don't ever mess with women who have retarded kids,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Alexandra |last=Le Tellier |title=Tracy Morgan apologizes, then tries out a different offensive rant |work=Los Angeles Times |date=June 29, 2011 |url= http://opinion.latimes.com/opinionla/2011/06/tracy-morgan-new-offensive-rant.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; and referred to a woman as "a cripple." Peter Bernes, CEO of The Arc, an organization supporting people with disabilities stated; "Tracy Morgan should apologize immediately. This quote is far too offensive to be excused as comedy, and it is very hurtful to people with intellectual and developmental disabilities and their families. Mr. Morgan has an incredibly powerful platform from which to fix this, and if he's learned anything in the last few weeks, he can't bomb this apology." He never apologized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tracy Morgan under fire again for cracking offensive jokes about the mentally disabled in NYC show |work= Daily News |date= June 29, 2011 |first=Shari |last=Weiss |url= http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/2011/06/29/2011-06-29_tracy_morgan_offensively_jokes_about_disabled_people_compares_young_retarded_mal.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Morgan's mother, Alicia Warden, said her [[Youngstown, Ohio]], home was on the verge of foreclosure as a result of being laid off from her job the previous year. Her home value at the time was estimated to be $28,000, and her request for help from Morgan resulted in an offer of a one-time gift of $2,000, which she refused. Morgan responded in a statement; "I am saddened that these untrue stories about me have people questioning my commitment to my family. For reasons that are between us, I have not seen my mother in 11 years and outside of a random call here and there have had little to no contact with my sister. We all have personal family issues that we have to deal with in life, but I choose to deal with mine in private and not through the media."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Tracy Morgan's mom: 'I'm trying to find the answer' |date=February 3, 2012 |url=http://www.vindy.com/news/2012/feb/03/tracy-morgans-mom-im-trying-to-find-the-/ |first=Guy|last= D'Alstolfo|work=[[The Vindicator]]| location = Youngstown, Ohio|accessdate=December 6, 2015| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120205045144/http://www.vindy.com/news/2012/feb/03/tracy-morgans-mom-im-trying-to-find-the-/ | archivedate=February 5, 2012 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Warden also reportedly attempted to visit Morgan in the hospital shortly after his 2014 traffic accident, but was turned away by hospital security and Wollover.  She said she returned the following day and was allowed five minutes with Morgan, who was still comatose at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Griffith, J. (June 11, 2014). Tracy Morgan's estranged mother: I was turned away at the hospital.
