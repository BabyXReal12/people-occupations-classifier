In January 2005, Carr hosted 'It's Been a Terrible Year' — a comedy review of 2004, on [[BBC Radio 2]]. Up until July 2006, he had a Sunday morning radio show on [[Xfm]], with the mercurial comedian [[Iain Morris]]. Features of the show have included:
* Goth Classics — Item lasting about four weeks in which [[the Sisters of Mercy]] track "This Corrosion" was played twice.
* Now That's What I Call A Jukebox – Long running item invented by Iain Morris where a number of songs are selected from a [[Now That's What I Call Music]] album, and are put to a vote. The song with the most votes is played.
* The Songs You Should Like and the Songs You Do Like (But You Like The Song You Should Like As Well) — This item consists of playing in sequence one artistically respectable but underrated or overlooked song (The first was 'Touch Sensitive' by [[The Fall (band)|the Fall]]) and one guilty pleasure ([[Liberty X]]'s "[[Just a Little (Liberty X song)|Just a Little]]" followed) On 9 July 2006, the item was renamed "A Song to Patronise, A Song To Sanitise".

In January 2006, Carr made a joke on Radio 4's Loose Ends, the punchline of which implied that [[Romani people|Gypsy]] women smelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,3604,1677955,00.html|title=BBC apologises for joke about Gypsy women on radio show|date=5 January 2006|publisher=Guardian Unlimited|location=London|first=Duncan|last=Campbell|accessdate=6 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the BBC issued an apology, Carr refused to apologise and continued to use the joke. He appeared in two episodes of the radio series of ''[[Flight of the Conchords (radio series)|Flight of the Conchords]]'' in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbcshop.com/Comedy/Flight-of-the-Conchords-The-Directors-Cut/invt/9781408409459 |title=Flight of the Conchords: The Director's Cut at BBC Shop |publisher=BBCShop.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091116125712/http://www.bbcshop.com/Comedy/Flight-of-the-Conchords-The-Directors-Cut/invt/9781408409459 |archivedate= 16 November 2009 |accessdate=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stand-up comedy===
Carr performs stand-up tours continuously over the course of the year, taking only five weeks off between them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview|last=Carr|first= Jimmy|interviewer=[[Melanie Sykes]]; [[Des O'Connor]]|title=[[The Paul O'Grady Show]]|publisher=[[Channel 4]]|date=3 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003 he sold out an entire month's performances of his [[Edinburgh Festival]] show ''Charm Offensive'' by the second day of the festival, and received 5-star reviews from four major newspapers. In 2004 he performed sold out solo shows at [[Dublin]]'s [[Vicar Street]], [[Leicester]]'s Comedy Festival, [[Glasgow]] Festival, [[Cat Laughs|Kilkenny Cat Laughs]] and the [[Galway]] Festival along with appearances at the [[Bloomsbury Theatre]] where he filmed his first live DVD.

Also in 2004 he threatened to sue fellow comedian [[Jim Davidson (comedian)|Jim Davidson]] for using a joke that Carr considered 'his'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3539246.stm|title=Stand-ups square up over fat joke|date=5 August 2004|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The matter was dropped when it became apparent that the joke in question was an old one used for decades by many different comedians. He toured the country with his show, ''A Public Display of Affection'', starting on 9 April 2005 at the [[Gulbenkian Theatre]] in [[Canterbury]] and ending on 14 January 2006 at the [[Gielgud Theatre]] in London's [[West End of London|West End]]. He also appeared at the EICC during the [[Edinburgh Festival]] in August 2005 with his ''Off The Telly'' show. Later on in the year, in late November, he released his second DVD "Jimmy Carr: Stand Up".

In August 2006, he commenced the tour ''Gag Reflex'', for which he won the 2006 [[British Comedy Award]] for "Best Live Stand up". He released his third DVD, ''Jimmy Carr: Comedian'' in November 2007. He also performed at the 2006 [[Just for Laughs]] festival in [[Montreal]], as well as making a return visit to the [[Newbury, Berkshire|Newbury]] Comedy Festival. In 2003, he was listed in ''[[the Observer]]'' as one of the 50 funniest acts in British comedy. In 2007, a poll on the [[Channel 4]] website for 100 Greatest Stand Ups, Jimmy Carr was the 12th. A new national tour commenced in autumn 2007 named ''Repeat Offender'', which began at the [[Edinburgh Festival]] that year. In late 2008, Carr began touring his latest show, entitled ''Joke Technician''.

In October 2009, Carr received criticism from several Sunday tabloid newspapers for a joke he made about British soldiers who had lost limbs in [[Iraq]] and [[Afghanistan]], saying that the UK would have a strong team in the [[London 2012 Paralympic Games]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/6427618/Anger-over-Jimmy-Carrs-joke-about-war-amputees.html|title=Anger over Jimmy Carr's joke about war amputees|date=25 October 2009|publisher=Telegraph.co.uk|location=London|author=Staff|accessdate=10 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carr defended his own joke as "totally acceptable" in an interview with ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2009/nov/05/jimmy-carr-paralympics-joke|title=Jimmy Carr: 'I thought my Paralympics joke was totally acceptable'|date=5 November 2009|newspaper=The Guardian|location=London|author=Stephen Moss|accessdate=24 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tour started with a run at the Edinburgh Festival before touring the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ents24.com/web/artist/7992/Jimmy_Carr.html|title=Ents24: Jimmy Carr|publisher=Ents24.com|accessdate=10 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Second Life''===
On 21 December 2006, Carr announced plans to become the first major comedian to perform in the virtual reality world of ''[[Second Life]]''. This was confirmed on his MySpace webpage on 3 January 2007, and a competition launched to choose a select audience from the list of his MySpace friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6227869.stm|title=BBC Story on Carr's ''Second Life'' performance|publisher=BBC News|date=3 January 2007|accessdate=10 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carr's ''Second Life'' show took place on 3 February 2007 at 7:00pm (19:00), at Adam Street Bar and Members' Club in [[Central London]].

===''The Naked Jape''===
In 2006, Carr and Lucy Greeves &lt;ref&gt;''The Naked Jape''Italic text''''&lt;/ref&gt;published a book titled ''The Naked Jape: Uncovering the Hidden World of Jokes'' on the history and theory of joke-telling.

==2012 tax avoidance controversy==
In June 2012, Carr's involvement in an alleged [[K2 (tax scheme)|K2]] [[tax avoidance]] scheme came to light after an investigation by ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jun/19/tax-scheme-jimmy-carr-hmrc|title=Tax avoidance scheme used by Jimmy Carr investigated by HMRC|newspaper=The Guardian|date=19 June 2012|accessdate=19 June 2012|location=London|first=Shiv|last=Malik}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scheme is understood to involve UK earners "quitting" their job and signing new employment contracts with offshore [[Shell corporation|shell companies]] based in the low tax jurisdiction of [[Jersey]]. Then-Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] commented on the issue: "People work hard, they pay their taxes, they save up to go to one of his shows. They buy the tickets. He is taking the money from those tickets and he, as far as I can see, is putting all of that into some very dodgy tax avoiding schemes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-18521468|title=Jimmy Carr tax affairs 'morally wrong' – Cameron|newspaper=BBC News|date=20 June 2012|accessdate=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carr has since pulled out of the scheme, apologizing for "a terrible error of judgement".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1/&gt;

Viewing figures of the episode of his topical show ''8 out of 10 Cats'', recorded on the day of his apology and broadcast the following day, almost doubled compared with the previous week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-18569728|publisher=BBC News|title=Jimmy Carr: Tax row sees Channel 4 ratings soar|date=24 June 2012|accessdate=25 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier in 2012, Carr had lampooned people who avoid paying their taxes during the second series of Channel 4's satirical news programme ''[[10 O'Clock Live]]''.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1/&gt; A sketch from the show, in which he poked fun at the 1% tax rate of [[Barclays|Barclays Bank]] and described tax lawyers as being "aggressive" and "amoral", was regarded as having "come back to haunt him".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1/&gt;

In February 2018, Carr appeared on ''[[Room 101 (TV series)|Room 101]]'', where he talked about the controversy. Though he admitted that what he did is wrong, he said that there was some level of hypocrisy in the comments Cameron had made about him in 2012, noting that members of Cameron's family and [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] have subsequently been mentioned in the [[Panama Papers]] and [[Paradise Papers]] tax evasion scandals. Carr said that the law should become clearer by eliminating any [[loophole]]s, instead of leaving it up to people to decide what is morally right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/tax-cheat-jimmy-carr-calls-11896308 |title=Jimmy Carr say legal loopholes that let him avoid tax should be closed |last=Jefferies |first=Mark |date=22 January 2018 |website=Mirror Online |access-date=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
At age 26, he had what he calls "an early midlife crisis", during which he lost his [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Brian Logan |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/jun/22/will-jimmy-carrs-career-survive?newsfeed=true |title=Will Jimmy Carr's career survive the tax avoidance |publisher=Guardian |date= 22 June 2012|accessdate=20 May 2013 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has since made comments critical of [[organized religion|organised religion]]. Carr has stated that he underwent a lot of psychotherapy (specifically [[neuro-linguistic programming]]) at the time of his crisis in order to help him cope with his loss of faith, and that he has qualified as a therapist.&lt;ref&gt;BBC Radio 4, [[The Museum of Curiosity#Series 4|The Museum of Curiosity, Season 4, episode 1]], broadcast 3 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Carr lives in [[North London]] with his Canadian-born girlfriend, Karoline Copping, a commissioning editor for [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]],&lt;ref name=Indy/&gt; with whom he has been since 2001.&lt;ref name="Guardian women"&gt;{{cite news|author=Jon Bennett|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/mar/09/familyandrelationships2|title=What I know about women|publisher=The Guardian|date=9 March 2008|accessdate=10 March 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
