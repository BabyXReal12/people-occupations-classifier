'''Estelle Getty''' ([[given names|née]] '''Scher'''; also known as '''Estelle Gettleman'''; July 25, 1923 – July 22, 2008) was an American [[Actor|actress]] and comedian, who appeared in [[film]], [[television]], and [[theatre]]. She was best known for her role as [[Sophia Petrillo]] on ''[[The Golden Girls]]'' from 1985 to 1992, which won her an [[Emmy]] and a [[Golden Globe]], on ''[[The Golden Palace]]'' from 1992 to 1993, and on ''[[Empty Nest]]'' from 1993 to 1995. In her later years, after retiring from acting, she battled [[Dementia with Lewy bodies|Lewy body dementia]].&lt;ref name="guardian-obit"&gt;{{cite news |last=Carlson|first=Michael |title=Obituary: Estelle Getty |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2008/jul/24/television.television |accessdate=October 13, 2013 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=July 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Estelle Getty was born Estelle Scher on July 25, 1923 to Sarah and Charles Scher. Her parents were [[History of the Jews in Poland|Polish Jewish]] immigrants who owned a glass store in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;1930 United States Federal Census&lt;/ref&gt; She had a sister, Roslyn, and a brother, David.&lt;ref name=filmr&gt;{{cite web|title=Estelle Getty Biography (1923-)|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/49/Estelle-Getty.html|work=Film Reference|accessdate=October 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Getty got her start in the [[Yiddish theater]] and also as a comedian in the [[Catskills]] [[borscht belt]] resorts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Goodbye Golden Girl: Comic actress Estelle Getty dies at 84|url=http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/2.209/goodbye-golden-girl-comic-actress-estelle-getty-dies-at-84-1.250261|accessdate=October 13, 2013|newspaper=[[Haaretz]]|date=July 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

Getty played the mother of [[Harvey Fierstein]]'s character in the original [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] run of ''[[Torch Song Trilogy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Simonson|first=Robery|title=Estelle Getty, Star of "Golden Girls," Dies at 84|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/119713-Estelle-Getty-Star-of-Golden-Girls-Dies-at-84|archive-url=https://archive.is/20131013122146/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/119713-Estelle-Getty-Star-of-Golden-Girls-Dies-at-84|dead-url=yes|archive-date=October 13, 2013|accessdate=October 13, 2013|newspaper=[[Playbill]]|date=July 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Gussow, Mel | title=Theatre Review: Fierstein's 'Torch Song' | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/01/theater/theater-fierstein-s-torch-song.html | work=The New York Time | date=November 1, 1981 | accessdate=June 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Getty is best known for her role as [[Sophia Petrillo]] on the popular 1980s [[sitcom]] ''[[The Golden Girls]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Weber|first=Bruce|title=Estelle Getty, 'Golden Girls' Matriarch, Dies at 84|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/23/arts/television/23getty.html|accessdate=October 13, 2013|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her character was the [[Sicily|Sicilian]] mother of [[Dorothy Zbornak]], played by [[Bea Arthur|Beatrice Arthur]], although Getty was, in fact, one year younger than Arthur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lansden|first=Pamela|title=Estelle Getty Zings for Her Supper as Bea Arthur's Zap-Happy Mom on Golden Girls|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20093266,00.html|accessdate=October 13, 2013|newspaper=[[People (magazine)|People]]|date=March 31, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lawson|first=Sarah|title=Great Moments in Age-Inappropriate Casting|url=http://6thfloor.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/19/great-moments-in-age-inappropriate-casting/|accessdate=October 13, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, the role earned Getty the [[Emmy Award]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series|Outstanding Supporting Actress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bernstein|first=Adam|title=Estelle Getty, 84; 'Golden Girl' Actress Won an Emmy Award|url=https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2008-07-23/news/36768221_1_barry-gettleman-arthur-gettleman-comedy-series|accessdate=October 13, 2013|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=July 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During her time on ''The Golden Girls'', Getty, along with Steve Delsohn, co-wrote an autobiography entitled ''If I Knew Then, What I Know Now... So What?'' (Contemporary Books, 1988).&lt;ref name=filmr/&gt; She further capitalized on her success by releasing an exercise video for senior citizens in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Glenn Haas|first=Jane|title=Estelle Getty leads a workout for seniors|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1993-12-31/features/1993365117_1_estelle-getty-picaud-exercise|accessdate=October 13, 2013|newspaper=[[Baltimore Sun]]|date=December 31, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, following her seven-season role on ''The Golden Girls'', Getty, with [[Betty White]] and [[Rue McClanahan]] returned as their characters Sophia Petrillo, [[Rose Nylund]] and [[Blanche Devereaux]] respectively, in the spin-off series, ''[[The Golden Palace]]''. The new show saw the three remaining cast members from the original series invest in a Miami hotel. The series was cancelled after just one season. Getty reprised her role of Sophia once again for a guest appearance in ''[[Nurses (TV series)|Nurses]]'', and for the final time when she joined ''[[Empty Nest]]'', another spin-off series from ''The Golden Girls''. She appeared in the series for the final two seasons.

Getty made numerous guest appearances on a diverse variety of popular television series, including ''[[Fantasy Island (1977 TV series)|Fantasy Island]]'', ''[[Cagney &amp; Lacey]]'', ''[[Blossom (TV series)|Blossom]]'', ''[[Touched by an Angel]]'', ''[[Mad About You]]'' and ''[[The Nanny]]''. Her numerous film roles include ''[[Tootsie]]'', ''[[Mask (film)|Mask]]'' and ''[[Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot]]'', alongside Sylvester Stallone, which earned her a [[Razzie Award for Worst Supporting Actress]].

==Personal life ==
Getty attended [[Seward Park High School]] in New York City.&lt;ref name="Luther"&gt;{{cite news|last=Luther|first=Claudia|title=Estelle Getty, 84; 'Golden Girls' actress brought humor, depth to mother roles|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/newsletter/la-me-getty23-2008jul23,0,3217229.story|accessdate=October 13, 2013|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=July 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was married to Arthur Gettleman (whose name she adapted into her stage name) from December 21, 1947 until his death in 2004.&lt;ref name="Luther"/&gt; The couple had two sons: Carl Gettleman, who lives in [[California]], and Barry Gettleman, who lives in [[Florida]].&lt;ref name="getty-faq"&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions|url=http://www.estellegetty.com/faq.html|work=EstelleGetty.com|accessdate=November 16, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110412025419/http://www.estellegetty.com/faq.html|archivedate=April 12, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, as later reported in [[Star (magazine)|''Star'' magazine]], Getty helped to nurse her 29-year-old nephew Steven Scher, who was near death and suffering from the final stages of [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Estelle Getty|url=http://www.gayglobe.us/estellegetty.html|work=Gay Globe Magazine Média TV|accessdate=November 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because Scher's parents lived in England and his friends were no longer able to care for him in [[Greensboro, North Carolina]], Getty had him flown to California and admitted to hospice care. He died in January 1992.

==Illness and death==
[[File:Estelle Getty Grave.jpg|thumb|upright|Grave of Estelle Getty at Hollywood Forever Cemetery]]
In 2000, Getty stopped making public appearances after revealing she had [[Parkinson's disease]] and [[osteoporosis]]. Upon reassessment, Getty's diagnosis was revised to [[Dementia with Lewy bodies|Lewy body dementia]], a form of dementia that has similar symptoms to both Parkinson's and [[Alzheimer's disease]].&lt;ref name="getty-faq"/&gt; ''Golden Girls'' cast members who attempted to talk to her on the phone or in person found that she couldn't remember them, or anything about the show. Bea Arthur said that even during production of the series, Getty had so much trouble remembering her lines that they should have known something was wrong from the beginning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A 'Golden Girl's Tragic Battle with Dementia|url=http://et.tv.yahoo.com/tv/2004/11/19/goldengirlsegetty/|accessdate=October 13, 2013|newspaper=[[Entertainment Tonight]]|date=November 19, 2004|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050208032459/http://et.tv.yahoo.com/tv/2004/11/19/goldengirlsegetty/|archivedate=February 8, 2005|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fonseca|first=Nicholas|title='Golden Girls': A 20th Anniversary Oral History|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1100651,00.html|accessdate=October 14, 2013|newspaper=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=April 24, 2009|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, [[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime]] television hosted a ''Golden Girls'' reunion, ''[[The Golden Girls: Their Greatest Moments]]''. In 2008, the show was awarded the Pop Culture award at the Sixth Annual [[TV Land]] Awards. Getty did not participate in either project due to declining health.

Getty died of complications from Lewy body dementia on July 22, 2008, three days before her 85th birthday.&lt;ref name="guardian-obit" /&gt; She is interred at [[Hollywood Forever Cemetery]] in [[Los Angeles]].
