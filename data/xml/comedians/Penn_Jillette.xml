'''Penn Fraser Jillette''' (born March 5, 1955) is an American [[Magic (illusion)|magician]], juggler, comedian, musician, inventor, actor, filmmaker, television personality and best-selling author known for his work with fellow magician [[Teller (magician)|Teller]] as half of the team [[Penn &amp; Teller]]. The duo have been featured in numerous stage and television shows such as ''[[Penn &amp; Teller: Fool Us]]'', and ''[[Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit]]'', and are currently headlining in [[Las Vegas]] at [[The Rio]]. Jillette serves as the act's orator and raconteur.

He has published 8 books, including the New York Times Bestseller, ''[[God, No!|God, No!: Signs You May Already Be an Atheist and Other Magical Tales]]''. He is also known for his advocacy of [[atheism]], [[scientific skepticism]], the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], [[libertarianism]], and [[free-market capitalism]].

==Early life==

Jillette was born in [[Greenfield, Massachusetts]]. His mother, Valda Rudolph Jillette (née Parks; 1909–2000),&lt;ref name="parents"&gt;Ancestry.com. Social Security Death Index [database on-line]. Provo, UT, USA: Ancestry.com Operations Inc, 2011. Original data: Social Security Administration. Social Security Death Index, Master File. Social Security Administration.&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[secretary]], and his father, Samuel Herbert Jillette (1912–1999),&lt;ref name="parents"/&gt; worked at Greenfield's Franklin County Jail.&lt;ref name="kelly"&gt;{{cite news |last=Kelly |first=Kevin |title=What you see, what you get |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/access/659808331.html?dids=659808331:659808331&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Dec+07%2C+1986&amp;author=Kevin+Kelly%2C+Globe+Staff&amp;pub=Boston+Globe+%28pre-1997+Fulltext%29&amp;desc=WHAT+YOU+SEE%2C+WHAT+YOU+GET&amp;pqatl=google |accessdate=September 2, 2011 |newspaper=The Boston Globe |date=December 7, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.recorder.com/story.cfm?id_no=5432510  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522022548/http://www.recorder.com/story.cfm?id_no=5432510 |date=May 22, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="New Yorker-Trillin-1989"&gt;{{cite news |title=A couple of Eccentric Guys |last=Trillin |first=Calvin |work=The New Yorker |date=May 15, 1989 |url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1989/05/15/1989_05_15_058_TNY_CARDS_000353087}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jillette became an [[atheist]] in his early teens after reading the [[Bible]] and was subsequently asked to leave the church after asking questions in a youth group that also made skeptics of his peers.&lt;ref name="ReligionMorality"&gt;{{cite news |title=Morality, Religion and Bullsh*t: An Interview with Penn Jillette |last=Shaffer |first=R |work=[[American Humanist Association|Humanist Network News]] |date=December 2012 |url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/HNN/details/2012-12-morality-religion-and-bullsht-an-interview-with-penn |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102205959/http://americanhumanist.org/HNN/details/2012-12-morality-religion-and-bullsht-an-interview-with-penn |archivedate=November 2, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jillette became disenchanted with traditional illusionist acts that presented the craft as authentic magic, such as [[The Amazing Kreskin]] on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]''. At age eighteen, he saw a show by illusionist [[James Randi]], and became enamored of his approach to magic that openly acknowledged deception as entertainment rather than a mysterious [[supernatural]] power. Jillette regularly acknowledges Randi as the one person on the planet he loves the most besides members of his family.&lt;ref name="skepticalitynov2012"&gt;{{cite podcast| url = http://www.skepticality.com/jill-jet-and-the-magical-tale-of-penn/

Jillette worked with [[high school]] classmate [[Michael Moschen]] in developing and performing a juggling act during the years immediately following their 1973 graduation.&lt;ref name="New Yorker-Trillin-1989"/&gt; In 1974, Jillette graduated from [[Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Clown College]].&lt;ref name="slate"&gt;
{{cite news |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2135432/ |title=Penn Jillette: The magician-comedian-writer's secrets revealed! |publisher=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |date=February 4, 2006 |first=Bryan |last=Curtis |accessdate=June 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, he was introduced to [[Teller (magician)|Teller]] by Weir Chrisemer, a mutual friend.&lt;ref name="P&amp;T-faq"/&gt; The three then formed a three-person act called Asparagus Valley Cultural Society which played in [[Amherst, Massachusetts|Amherst]] and San Francisco.&lt;ref name="New Yorker-Trillin-1989"/&gt; In 1981, he and Teller teamed up as [[Penn &amp; Teller]], and went on to do a successful [[Off Broadway]] and later [[Broadway theatre]] show called "Penn &amp; Teller" that toured nationally.&lt;ref name="New Yorker-Trillin-1989"/&gt;

==Career==
While the off-Broadway hit was running, in 1988 Jillette was in a speed [[mariachi]] [[power trio]] called Bongos, Bass and Bob. He played bass; bongos were by Dean J. Seal; and guitar was by Rob "Bob" Elk (Running Elk). The latter two became the a capella comedy duo Mr. Elk and Mr. Seal after the band broke up due to Jillette's movie commitments. They recorded an album with [[Kramer (musician)|Kramer]] at Noise New York called ''Never Mind the Sex Pistols, Here's Bongos Bass and Bob (What on Earth Were They Thinking?).'' It was released to almost no notice outside of a mention in ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin Magazine]]'', but was immortalized with a claymation video of the single, "Oral Hygiene".

Jillette was a contributor to the now-defunct ''[[PC/Computing]]'' magazine, having a regular back-section column between 1990 and 1994. He and the magazine parted ways over a dispute with a new editor James Martin in  {{date|September 2014}}.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Jillette felt the new editor was trying to tell him how to write his column and what topics he should be covering. Jillette asserts that he is unsure if he was fired or if he actually quit.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

Jillette was the primary voice announcer for the U.S.-based cable network [[Comedy Central]] in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="nbc-ident-bio"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.nbc.com/Identity/host.shtml| title = ''Identity'': Penn Jillette

|accessdate = June 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, Jillette purchased a house in [[Las Vegas Valley]] and dubbed it "The Slammer".&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;{{cite news|last=Tschorn|first=Adam|title=Welcome to the Slammer |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2004/apr/22/home/hm-jillette22?pg=1|accessdate=October 18, 2012 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=April 22, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It has been featured in dozens of television shows and articles and was designed by his friend Colin Summers. He formerly recorded music there, and conducted his radio show at the studio inside "The Slammer".&lt;ref name="otlstudio"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.otlstudio.com/projects/199601.php| title = The Slammer| publisher=Outside The Lines Studio| accessdate = October 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dellaCava"&gt;{{cite news| first = Marco R.| last = della Cava| url = https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2004-10-28-at-home-penn-jillette_x.htm| title = This is the manic magic house that Penn built|work=USA Today| date = October 29, 2004| accessdate = April 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, he sold "The Slammer" so that his family could move to a less remote location.&lt;ref name="latimes2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/realestate/hot-property/la-fi-hotprop-penn-jillette-las-vegas-20161215-story.html|title=The Slammer, Las Vegas home of magician Penn Jillette, sells for $1.88 million|website=LA Times|accessdate=January 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 1996, Jillette had a recurring role on ''[[Sabrina the Teenage Witch (1996 TV series)|Sabrina the Teenage Witch]]'' as Drell, the head of the Witches' Council. He and Teller both appeared in the pilot with [[Debbie Harry]] as the third member of the Council. The show was created by Jillette's friend [[Nell Scovell]].

Penn and Teller appear as comedians Rebo and Zooty in the 5th-season episode of ''[[Babylon 5]]'', "The Day of the Dead", written by [[Neil Gaiman]].

For a brief time in 1997, Jillette wrote bi-weekly dispatches for the [[search engine]] [[Excite.com]]. Each column ended with a pithy comment identifying which of the [[Penn &amp; Teller]] duo he was. (For example: "Penn Jillette is the half of Penn &amp; Teller that's detained at airports.") Jillette made a habit of linking many words in his online column to wacky sites that generally had nothing to do with the actual words. The columns are no longer available on the current Excite.com site, but have been republished with permission at PennAndTeller.com.&lt;ref name="penn-columns"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://pennandteller.com/sincity/penn-n-teller/pcc.html| title = "Penn's Columns" (index)| publisher = PennAndTeller.com| accessdate = October 12, 2007| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080202202011/http://pennandteller.com/sincity/penn-n-teller/pcc.html| archivedate = February 2, 2008| df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 2003, Jillette, along with Teller, began producing and hosting the show ''[[Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit!]]'' on [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]]. In the show, the two analyze cultural phenomena, debunk myths, criticize people and aspects of society they deem "[[bullshit]]".

In 2005 with actor [[Paul Provenza]], Jillette co-produced and co-directed ''[[The Aristocrats (film)|The Aristocrats]]'', a documentary film tracing the life of an obscene joke known as [[The Aristocrats (joke)|"The Aristocrats"]]. It principally consists of a variety of comedians telling their own versions of the joke.

From January 3, 2006, to March 2, 2007, Jillette hosted, along with fellow [[atheist]], [[skeptic]], and [[juggler]] [[Michael Goudeau]], a live, hour-long [[Talk radio|radio talk show]] broadcast on [[Free FM]]. The show, ''[[Penn Radio]]'', broadcast from his [[#Vintage Nudes Studio|Vintage Nudes Studio]] in his Las Vegas home. The most notable recurring segment of the show was "[[Monkey Tuesday]]" and later "The Pull of the Weasel". On March 2, 2007, Jillette announced that he would no longer be doing his radio show. He stated that he is a "show biz wimp" and decided to stop doing the show so he could spend more time with his children.

During the 2006–07 television season, Jillette hosted the prime-time game show ''[[Identity (game show)|Identity]]'' on NBC-TV.

In 2008, Jillette was a contestant on ''[[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. season 6)|Dancing with the Stars]]'', paired with professional dancer [[Kym Johnson]]. He was the first celebrity to be eliminated. A reference to his large feet as a sign of another large body part was bleeped in the West Coast airing.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

During 2010–2011, Jillette did a bi-weekly show on [[Revision3]] called ''Penn Point''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://revision3.com/pennpoint |title=Penn Point |work=Revision3 |access-date=May 25, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100522050852/http://revision3.com/pennpoint |archive-date=May 22, 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 16, 2011, Jillette's book ''[[God, No! Signs You May Already Be An Atheist and Other Magical Tales]]'' was released and made the New York Times Best Sellers shortly after, in the week of August 28, in the 14th position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Best Sellers|url=https://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/2011-09-04/hardcover-nonfiction/list.html|website=The New York Times|accessdate=May 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An avid upright bassist, Jillette frequently accompanies jazz pianist [[Mike Jones (jazz musician)|Mike Jones]], who opens for the magician's Las Vegas show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Malone|first=Andrew|title=Penn Jillette's Bass Magic|url=http://jazztimes.com/sections/tangents/articles/19709-penn-jillette-s-bass-magic|accessdate=November 13, 2011|newspaper=JazzTimes|date=December 2002|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120812085201/http://jazztimes.com/sections/tangents/articles/19709-penn-jillette-s-bass-magic|archivedate=August 12, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 16, 2018, Jones released a live jazz album with Jillette entitled ''The Show Before the Show'' which consisted of ten tracks played by the duo at the [[Rio Las Vegas]]. Jillette additionally performed at the famed [[Green Mill Cocktail Lounge]] to coincide with the album's debut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reich|first1=Howard|title=Yes, magician Penn can play jazz bass and proves it at Green Mill|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/music/reich/ct-ent-mikes-jones-review-0326-story.html|website=Chicago Tribune|publisher=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Jillette was one of the contestants on [[The Celebrity Apprentice 5|''The Celebrity Apprentice'' season 5]], beginning on February 19, 2012. He was fired from the show by Donald Trump during the Week 11 episode. Also on February 19, 2012, along with Michael Goudeau, he started the podcast ''[[Penn Jillette#Podcasts|Penn's Sunday School]]''.

In 2013, he returned for the [[All-Star Celebrity Apprentice]] season, where he successfully made his way to the finale, raising $663,655 for the charity of his choice, Opportunity Village.&lt;ref name="FinishSecond"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/blogs/kats-report/2013/may/20/jillette-finishes-second-spins-lot-magic-all-star-/ | title=Penn Jillette finishes second but spins a lot of magic on ‘All-Star Celebrity Apprentice’ | publisher=Las Vegas Sun| date=May 19, 2013 | accessdate=September 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 5, 2013, Penn and Teller were honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in the live performance category.

Penn credits magician and [[Skeptical movement|skeptical activist]] [[James Randi]] for his career.

===Jill-Jet===
In July 1999, Jillette was granted {{US patent|5920923}} for the "Jill-Jet", a hot-tub jet specially angled for a woman's pleasure. He has credited [[Debbie Harry]] of [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]] for suggesting the idea, as the two of them were once in a hot tub and Harry made a remark about changing the jets for a woman's pleasure. Jillette liked the idea enough to pursue a patent application at the [[USPTO]] under the patent title "Hydro-therapeutic Stimulator".&lt;ref name="uspto"&gt;{{cite web| last = Jillette| first = Penn| date = July 13, 1999| url = http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=5920923.PN.&amp;OS=PN/5920923&amp;RS=PN/5920923| title = "Hydro-therapeutic Stimulator" (U.S. Patent 5,920,923)| work=USPTO Patent Full Text and Image Database| publisher=[[United States Patent and Trademark Office]]
|accessdate = October 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The abstract of the patent explains that a "discharge nozzle is located within the tub and connected to the outlet, mounted to the seat so that the discharged water from the circulation pump automatically aligns with and is directed to stimulation points (e.g., the [[clitoris]]) of the female user when the female user sits in the seat." An article in the June 2006 issue of ''[[Playboy]]'' shed additional light on the invention. Originally, it was to be called the "ClitJet"; however, he stated that "Jill-Jet" was more suitable because it included his name in the title.

On the ''Penn Radio'' show, telling the listeners about the photo shoot for the ''Playboy'' article, Jillette mentioned that he has a Jill-Jet installed in a tub in his house, and that several of his female friends and friends' female spouses enjoy it a lot, but he is not aware of any other installations of a water jet in such a configuration anywhere else.

==Personal life==
Jillette says that he has an [[addictive personality]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview|first= Penn| last= Jillette| work=[[Here's the Thing]] |interviewer= [[Alec Baldwin]]| title=Penn Jillette| url= http://www.wnyc.org/story/htt-penn-jillette/| publisher= WNYC| date= August 18, 2015| accessdate= April 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and claims to have never had "so much as a puff of [[marijuana]] or a drop of alcohol" because he does not trust himself to do it in moderation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media| work=Penn And Teller's 'Bullshit!' |title= War On Drugs |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm7lavNFiTM |at=23:52| publisher= republished at ''YouTube.com''}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is an advocate of the legalization of all drugs and discontinuing the [[War on Drugs]].

Jillette is an [[atheism|atheist]], [[libertarianism|libertarian]] (he has stated that he may consider himself to be an [[Anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalist]]),&lt;ref name="pittsburghlive"&gt;{{cite web | last=Steigerwald | first=Bill | url=http://triblive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/opinion/columnists/qa/s_136178.html | title=Dear graduates: Work for freedom | date=May 24, 2003 | website=[[Pittsburgh Tribune-Review]] | accessdate=March 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[scientific skepticism|skeptic]], as well as an adherent to [[Ayn Rand]]'s [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivist]] philosophy, as stated on his ''Penn Says'' podcast. Jillette is a fellow at the libertarian think tank the [[Cato Institute]] and has stated that he "always" votes [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian]].&lt;ref name=vote&gt;[http://reason.com/archives/2008/10/29/whos-getting-your-vote/singlepage Who's Getting Your Vote?], ''[[Reason magazine|Reason]]''&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2007, Jillette took the "[[Blasphemy Challenge]]" offered by the [[Rational Response Squad]] and publicly denied the existence of a holy spirit.&lt;ref name="youtubeblasphemy"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2INdxjHgU0 | title=Penn's Blasphemy |accessdate=July 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
His cars' license plates read "atheist", "nogod", and "godless".&lt;ref name="Wang"&gt;{{cite web | last=Wang | first=K.S. | url=http://www.motortrend.com/features/consumer/112_0906_penn_jillette_celebrity_drive/index.html | title=Celebrity Drive: Penn Jillette, Magician, Comedian, Host, Author | date=June 1, 2009 | publisher=[[Motor Trend]] |accessdate=July 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Strangely enough, they wouldn't give me 'Infidel,'" he says.&lt;ref name="Wang"/&gt;

From 1987 to 1989, Jillette provided financial support to David and [[Jad Fair]] of the art rock band [[Half Japanese]] for their record label [[50 Skidillion Watts]]. This allowed the band to release the albums ''[[Music to Strip By]]'', ''The Band that Would be King'' and ''Charmed Life''. When asked about his assistance Jillette said, "anybody who listens to Half Jap becomes a fan." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.philly.com/1989-02-17/news/26155220_1_skidillion-watts-label-punk|title=The Flip Side Of The Ever-flip Penn Jillette What Else Could The Magician Have In His Bag Of Tricks?

In 2005 he wrote and read an essay for [[National Public Radio]] claiming that he was "beyond atheism. Atheism is not believing in God... I believe there is no God."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thisibelieve.org/dsp_ShowEssay.php?uid=34&amp;topessays=2&amp;start=165|title=There Is No God| author=|date=|work=thisibelieve.org|accessdate=August 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His atheism, he has explained, has informed every aspect of his life and thoughts, and as such is as crucial to him as [[theism|theistic beliefs]] are to the devout. Jillette encourages open discussion, debate, and proselytizing on the issue of [[Existence of God|God's existence]], believing that the issue is too important for opinions about it to remain private. Jillette does not dismiss all who do believe in God: A 2008 edition of his ''Penn Says'' podcast expresses his appreciation for a fan who brought him the gift of a pocket [[Gideon Bible]] after a performance because he realized that this individual sincerely cared enough about him to try to help him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=natecalaway |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fa9JE_ZVL88&amp;feature=related |title=The Gift of A Bible |publisher=YouTube |date=February 28, 2009 |accessdate=April 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:TAM 2012 Day2-Keynote-Penn &amp; Teller-4 7-14-2012.JPG|thumb|right|Jillette in 2012 at [[The Amazing Meeting]] in Las Vegas]]
Jillette stated that there is not enough information to make an informed decision on [[global warming]], that his gut told him it was not real, but his mind said that he can't prove it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=PTBSonShowtime |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWt2Rir8OQk |title=Penn &amp; Teller Discuss The Being Green Episode |publisher=YouTube |date=June 1, 2008 |accessdate=April 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has since changed his position and now believes that climate change is occurring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet |user=pennjillette |author=Penn Jillette |number=448242297788825600 |date=24 March 2014 |title=Um.

Jillette is a collector and connoisseur of [[song poem]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nerdist.com/2011/10/nerdist-podcast-130-penn-teller/| title= Nerdist Podcast #130: PENN &amp; TELLER|author=|date=|work=Nerdist|accessdate=August 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2014, Jillette's blood pressure landed him in the hospital. By his birthday, March 5, 2015, he had lost {{convert|105|lb|abbr=on}}. He follows Dr. [[Joel Fuhrman|Joel Fuhrman's]] [[Nutritarian]] diet, which means that he eats little or no animal products, no processed grains, and no added sugar or salt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=How Penn Jillette Lost 105 Lbs. — Without Magic!|url=http://greatideas.people.com/2015/04/08/penn-jillette-weight-loss-las-vegas-home/|accessdate=April 10, 2015|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]|date=April 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Penn is featured in Eating You Alive, a 2016 American documentary about food and health.

Jillette is married to Emily Jillette, and they have two children, Zolten and Moxie CrimeFighter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Penn Jillette’s kids Moxie CrimeFighter and Zolten laugh at ‘god’|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/entertainment/penn-jillette-s-kids-moxie-crimefighter-and-zolten-laugh-god| accessdate=August 8, 2015|work=Las Vegas Review-Journal|date=March 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Red fingernail===
Speculation arises from Jillette's red fingernail on his left hand. From the FAQ from [[Penn &amp; Teller|Penn &amp; Teller's]] official website, there are three common answers:

# It means he once shot a man for asking personal questions.
# When Jillette first began performing, his mother told him to get a manicure because people would be looking at his hands. In response to this, he had all of his nails painted red as a joke. The one remaining red fingernail is in memory of his mother.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"&gt;{{cite web|author=pennsays |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxq9ORifmOs |title=Painting My Fingernail |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=April 14, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090611211728/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxq9ORifmOs |archivedate=June 11, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In direct response to questions about his red fingernail, Penn has stated "People are asking about my fingernail. Wear my Dad's ring and my Mom's nail polish. Just for remembrance and respect."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet| user= pennjillette|author= Jillette, Penn | number= 328691791622709250| date= April 28, 2013| title= People are asking about my fingernail.
