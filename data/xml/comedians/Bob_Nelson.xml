'''Bob Nelson''' (born March 3, 1958), is an American [[stand-up comedian]] and [[actor]].

==Life and career==
Nelson began doing stand-up in comedy clubs while a theater student at [[Nassau Community College]] in the late 1970s.&lt;ref name=mcall&gt;Len Righi, "[http://articles.mcall.com/1993-05-22/entertainment/2916377_1_bob-saget-love-turret Multiple Personalities Comic Bob Nelson Brings His Cast Of Characters To Valley]". ''[[The Morning Call]]'', May 22, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nelson specializes in rubber-faced comedy characters, much as [[Red Skelton]] did in his heyday. His most popular originals include Jiffy Jeff, a punch drunk prizefighter with a Gym in NYC; Eppy Epperman, a brilliant but nerdy kid with deeper insights than meet the eye; an entire football team of stereotypical characters and  unnamed football stars doing a charity commercial; Wilby Stuckerson, a [[hillbilly]] chicken farmer based on a life experience of Nelson's from [[Shreveport, Louisiana]], and Mr. Pingyeh, an argumentative Asian man who is more eloquent than the people with whom he argues. He is also known for his [[Jacques-Yves Cousteau]] impersonations and his "football act" in which he parodies the old team rundowns in the College Football All-Star games, in which players announce their names, numbers and teams (example: "Quasimodo... Notre Dame... halfback!")

Nelson was [[Rodney Dangerfield]]'s opening act for eight years and was featured in two of Rodney's HBO stand-up comedy showcases, alongside [[Jerry Seinfeld]], [[Roseanne Barr]], [[Rita Rudner]] and [[Bob Saget]]. That led to two HBO specials starring Nelson, including "Nelson Schmelson".&lt;ref name=mcall/&gt; He considers Rodney his 'Comedy Godfather'. Nelson was also in a comedy group called "The Identical Triplets" with [[Eddie Murphy]] and [[Rob Bartlett]].

Nelson has appeared several times on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' and various other talk shows, such as [[David Letterman]], [[Regis Philbin]], and [[Merv Griffin]] and appeared on tour with [[Gallagher (comedian)|Gallagher]] during 2016–17.

While he formerly incorporated [[profanity]] into his act, Nelson now works clean. He cites a meeting with Red Skelton, in which Skelton convinced him to stop using swear words. Since that meeting, Nelson claims he hasn't sworn while performing.

Nelson had performed and shared at “Come Thirsty”, a series of church seminars by [[Max Lucado]] and [[Michael W. Smith]]. He was featured on 'Life Today' with James &amp; Betty Robinson.  He is also currently being seen regularly on “Bananas Comedy”, which is a very popular family-friendly television comedy show that airs throughout the US and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thegrablegroup.com/other-clients/comedian-bob-nelson/ "Bob Nelson Bio | The Grable Group"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100828113704/http://thegrablegroup.com/other-clients/comedian-bob-nelson/ |date=August 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 Nelson relocated his family and his show to [[Branson, Missouri]] to take a break from the road, where he performed locally for three years. In 2013, Nelson and family returned to Long Island.

Nelson won an [[Emmy Award]] in [[Philadelphia]] for a children’s show he wrote and starred in, called ''Double Muppet Hold the Onions'', in 1983.&lt;ref name=mcall/&gt; He also had supporting roles in [[Nora Ephron]]'s directorial film debut ''[[This Is My Life (1992 film)|This is My Life]]'' with [[Julie Kavner]] and [[Ivan Reitman]]'s ''[[Kindergarten Cop]]'' with [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]. He also starred in the film ''[[Brain Donors]]'', the 1992 update of the [[Marx Brothers]]' comedy ''[[A Night at the Opera (film)|A Night at the Opera]]''. In the latter film, Nelson plays what would have been the [[Harpo Marx]] part.
