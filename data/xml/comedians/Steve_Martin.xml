'''Stephen Glenn Martin''' (born August 14, 1945) is an American actor, comedian, writer, producer, playwright, author, and musician. Martin came to public notice in the 1960s as a writer for ''[[The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour]]'', and later as a frequent guest on ''[[The Tonight Show]]''. In the 1970s, Martin performed his offbeat, [[surreal humor|absurdist]] comedy routines before packed houses on national tours. Since the 1980s, having branched away from comedy, Martin has become a successful actor, as well as an author, playwright, pianist, and banjo player, eventually earning him an [[Emmy]], [[Grammy]], and [[American Comedy Awards|American Comedy]] awards, among other honors.

In 2004, [[Comedy Central]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://everything2.com/title/Comedy+Central%2527s+100+Greatest+Stand-Ups+of+all+Time|title=Comedy Central's 100 Greatest Stand-Ups of all Time|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ranked Martin at sixth place in a list of the 100 greatest stand-up comics. He was awarded an [[Honorary Academy Award]] at the Academy's 5th Annual [[Governors Awards]] in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Academy Unveils 2013 Governors Awards: Honorees Angelina Jolie, Angela Lansbury, Steve Martin, Piero Tosi|url=http://www.deadline.com/2013/09/governors-awards-2013-winners-academy-oscars/|publisher=Deadline.com|accessdate=October 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While he has played [[banjo]] since an early age, and included music in his comedy routines from the beginning of his professional career, he has increasingly dedicated his career to music since the 2000s, acting less and spending much of his professional life playing banjo, recording, and touring with various bluegrass acts, including [[Earl Scruggs]], with whom he won a [[Grammy]] for Best Country Instrumental Performance in 2002. He released his first solo music album, ''[[The Crow: New Songs for the 5-String Banjo]]'', in 2009, for which he won the Grammy Award for Best Bluegrass Album.

==Early life==
[[File:Steve Martin HS Yearbook.jpeg|thumb|Steve Martin as a senior in high school, 1963]]
Martin was born on August 14, 1945,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sKCfomKSa74C&amp;pg=PA204 |page=204 |last=Whiteley |first=Sandy |title=On This Date |publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional |year=2002 |isbn=0071398279}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bGjsvmNt8UgC&amp;pg=PA94 |page=94 |title=Universal Men |work=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] |date=September 1999 |volume=15 |number=9 |issn=0886-3032 |publisher=SPIN Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Waco, Texas]],&lt;ref&gt;Walker (1999) p1&lt;/ref&gt; the son of Mary Lee (née Stewart; 1913–2002) and Glenn Vernon Martin (1914–1997), a real estate salesman and aspiring actor.&lt;ref name="filmref"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ieVj9Z-w12UC&amp;pg=PA2&amp;dq=%22steve+martin%22+waco&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=v8SwTLHjFdy4jAeY25yPCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22steve%20martin%22%20waco&amp;f=false Morris (1999) p 2].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wargs.com/other/martin.html |title=Ancestry of Steve Martin |publisher=Wargs.com |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin was raised in [[Inglewood, California]] with brother Fred and sister Melinda Martin, and then later in [[Garden Grove, California]], in a [[Baptist]] family.&lt;ref&gt;Martin (2007) pp.20–39&lt;/ref&gt; Martin was a cheerleader of [[Garden Grove High School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/feb/20/top-5-famous-former-male-cheerleaders/|title=Top 5: Famous former male cheerleaders|work=The Washingtion Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of his earliest memories is of seeing his father, as an extra, serving drinks onstage at the Call Board Theatre on Melrose Place. During [[World War II]], in the United Kingdom, Martin's father had appeared in a production of ''[[Our Town]]'' with [[Raymond Massey]]. Expressing his affection through gifts, like cars and bikes, Martin's father was stern, and not emotionally open to his son.&lt;ref Name="Mild"/&gt; He was proud but critical, with Martin later recalling that in his teens his feelings for his father were mostly ones of [[hatred]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Wills |first=Dominic |title= Steve Martin – Biography
|url = http://www.talktalk.co.uk/entertainment/film/biography/artist/steve-martin/biography/118 |publisher=TalkTalk |accessdate=May 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin's first job was at [[Disneyland]], selling guidebooks on weekends and full-time during the school's summer break. That lasted for three years (1955–1958). During his free time, he frequented the [[Main Street, U.S.A.#Shopping|Main Street Magic shop]], where tricks were demonstrated to potential customers.&lt;ref Name="Mild"/&gt;  While working at Disneyland, he was captured in the background of the [[home movie]] that was made into the short-subject film ''[[Disneyland Dream]]'', coincidentally becoming his first film appearance.  By 1960, he had mastered several of the tricks and illusions and took a paying job at the Magic shop in [[Fantasyland]] in August. There he perfected his talents for magic, juggling, and creating balloon animals in the manner of mentor [[Wally Boag]],&lt;ref name=Boag&gt;Martin (2007) p18–19&lt;/ref&gt; frequently performing for tips.&lt;ref&gt;Martin (2007) p 39&lt;/ref&gt; In his authorized biography, close friend Morris Walker suggests that Martin could "be described most accurately as an agnostic [...] he rarely went to church and was never involved in organized religion of his own volition".&lt;ref&gt;Walker (1999) p40&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comedy===
After high school graduation, Martin attended [[Santa Ana College]], taking classes in drama and English poetry. In his free time, he teamed up with friend and [[Garden Grove High School]] classmate Kathy Westmoreland to participate in comedies and other productions at the Bird Cage Theatre. He joined a comedy troupe at [[Knott's Berry Farm]].&lt;ref Name="Mild"/&gt; Later, he met budding actress [[Stormie Omartian|Stormie Sherk]], and they developed comedy routines and became romantically involved. Sherk's influence caused Martin to apply to the [[California State University, Long Beach]], for enrollment with a major in philosophy.&lt;ref Name="Mild"/&gt; Sherk enrolled at [[UCLA]], about an hour's drive north, and the distance eventually caused them to lead separate lives.&lt;ref&gt;Martin (2007) p 65&lt;/ref&gt;

Inspired by his philosophy classes, Martin considered becoming a professor instead of an actor-comedian. His time at college changed his life. {{cquote|It changed what I believe and what I think about everything. I majored in philosophy. Something about [[Non sequitur (absurdism)|non-sequiturs]] appealed to me. In philosophy, I started studying [[logic]], and they were talking about [[Causality|cause and effect]], and you start to realize, 'Hey, there is no cause and effect! There is no logic! There is no anything!' Then it gets real easy to write this stuff because all you have to do is twist everything hard—you twist the [[climax (narrative)|punch line]], you twist the [[Non sequitur (absurdism)|non-sequitur]] so hard away from the things that set it up.&lt;ref name=RS&gt;Fong-Torres, Ben (1982) "Steve Martin Sings: The Rolling Stone Interview". ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' February 18, 1982. Issue 363&lt;/ref&gt;}} Martin recalls reading a treatise on comedy that led him to think: {{cquote|What if there were no punch lines? What if there were no indicators? What if I created tension and never released it? What if I headed for a climax, but all I delivered was an anticlimax? What would the audience do with all that tension? Theoretically, it would have to come out sometime. But if I kept denying them the formality of a punch line, the audience would eventually pick their own place to laugh, essentially out of desperation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Martin |first=Steve |date=February 2008 |title=Being Funny: How the path-breaking comedian got his act together |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/being-funny-17061140|magazine=Smithsonian |access-date=August 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Martin periodically spoofed his philosophy studies in his 1970s stand-up act, comparing philosophy with studying geology. {{cquote|If you're studying geology, which is all facts, as soon as you get out of school you forget it all, but philosophy you remember just enough to screw you up for the rest of your life.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|0000188}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1967, Martin transferred to [[UCLA]] and switched his major to theater. While attending college, he appeared in an episode of ''[[The Dating Game]]''. Martin began working local clubs at night, to mixed notices, and at twenty-one, he dropped out of college.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stevemartin.com/stop_the_presses/newsweek_78.php "SteveMartin.com | Stop the Presses"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227054918/http://www.stevemartin.com/stop_the_presses/newsweek_78.php |date=February 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Early career: stand-up===

In 1967, his former girlfriend Nina Goldblatt, a dancer on ''[[The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour]]'', helped Martin land a writing job with the show by submitting his work to head writer [[Mason Williams]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin, (2007) p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; Williams initially paid Martin out of his own pocket. Along with the other writers for the show, Martin won an [[Emmy Award]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/steve-martin|title=Steve Martin|work=Television Academy}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1969, aged 23.&lt;ref name="Mild"/&gt; He also wrote for [[John Denver]] (a neighbor of his in [[Aspen, Colorado]] now, at one point), ''[[The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour]]'', and ''[[The Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour]].'' Martin's first TV appearance was on ''[[The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour]]'' in 1968. He says: {{cquote|[I] appeared on ''The [[Virginia Graham]] Show,'' circa 1970. I looked grotesque. I had a hairdo like a helmet, which I blow-dried to a puffy bouffant, for reasons I no longer understand. I wore a frock coat and a silk shirt, and my delivery was mannered, slow and self-aware. I had absolutely no authority. After reviewing the show, I was depressed for a week.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;}} During these years his roommates included comedian [[Gary Mule Deer]] and singer/guitarist [[Michael Johnson (singer)|Michael Johnson]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin, (2007) p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; Martin opened for groups such as [[The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band]] (who returned the favor by appearing in his 1980 television special ''All Commercials''), [[The Carpenters]], and [[Toto (band)|Toto]]. He appeared at San Francisco's [[The Boarding House (nightclub)|The Boarding House]], among other venues. He continued to write, earning an Emmy nomination for his work on ''[[Dick Van Dyke|Van Dyke and Company]]'' in 1976.
[[File:Steve Martin 2.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Steve Martin, 1976]]
In the mid-1970s, Martin made frequent appearances as a stand-up comedian on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'',&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite web |author=Martin, Steve |year=2008 |title=Being Funny |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/funny-martin-200802.html |archivedate=October 14, 2009 |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091014124041/http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts%2Dculture/funny%2Dmartin%2D200802.html |dead-url=yes |work=[[Smithsonian Magazine]] |accessdate=February 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on  ''[[The Gong Show]]'', [[HBO]]'s ''[[On Location (TV series)|On Location]]'', ''[[The Muppet Show]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Garlen|first1=Jennifer C.|last2=Graham|first2=Anissa M.|title=Kermit Culture: Critical Perspectives on Jim Henson's Muppets|year=2009|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company|isbn=078644259X|page=218}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[NBC]]'s ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (''SNL''). ''SNL''{{'s}} audience jumped by a million viewers when he made guest appearances, and he was one of the show’s most successful hosts.&lt;ref name="Mild"/&gt; Martin appeared on 27 ''Saturday Night Live'' shows and he guest-hosted 15 times, bested only in number of presentations by host [[Alec Baldwin]] (who has hosted 17 times {{as of|2017|February|lc=y}}). On the show, Martin popularized the [[air quotes]] gesture, which uses four fingers to make double quote marks in the air.&lt;ref name="Frum"&gt;{{cite book |title= How We Got Here: The '70s|last= Frum|first= David|authorlink= David Frum|year= 2000|publisher=Basic Books|location= New York City|isbn= 0-465-04195-7|pages= 36–37|url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; While on the show Martin became close with several of the cast members, including [[Gilda Radner]]. Radner died of [[ovarian cancer]] on May 20, 1989; a visibly shaken Martin hosted ''SNL'' that night and featured footage of himself and Radner together in a 1978 sketch.

In the 1970s, his TV appearances led to the release of comedy albums that went [[Music recording sales certification|platinum]].&lt;ref name="Mild"/&gt; The track "Excuse Me" on his first album, ''[[Let's Get Small]]'' (1977), helped establish a national catch phrase.&lt;ref name="Mild"/&gt; His next album, ''[[A Wild and Crazy Guy]]'' (1978), was an even bigger success, reaching the No. 2 spot on the U.S. sales chart, selling over a million copies. "Just a wild and crazy guy" became another of Martin's known catch phrases.&lt;ref name="Mild"/&gt; The album featured a character based on a series of ''Saturday Night Live'' sketches where Martin and [[Dan Aykroyd]] played the Festrunk Brothers; Yortuk and Georgi (respectively) were bumbling [[Czechoslovak]] would-be playboys. The album ends with the song "[[King Tut (song)|King Tut]]", sung and written by Martin and backed by the "Toot Uncommons", members of the [[Nitty Gritty Dirt Band]]. It was later released as a single, reaching No. 17 on the U.S. charts in 1978 and selling over a million copies.&lt;ref name="Mild"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1684540,00.html "Steve Martin, a Mild and Crazy Guy". ''Time Magazine'' article. November 15, 2007]. Retrieved August 14, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|wgTPH5y1-ZI|"King Tut" Video}}. Retrieved August 14, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The song came out during the [[Tutankhamun|King Tut]] craze that accompanied the popular traveling exhibit of the Egyptian king's tomb artifacts. Both albums won [[Grammy]]s for ''Best Comedy Recording'' in 1977 and 1978, respectively. Martin performed "King Tut" on the edition of April 22, 1978, of ''SNL''.

Decades later, in 2012, ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' described Martin's unique style and its impact on audiences:
{{cquote|[Martin was] both a consummate entertainer and a glib, knowing parody of a consummate entertainer. He was at once a hammy populist with an uncanny, unprecedented feel for the tastes of a mass audience and a sly intellectual whose goofy shtick cunningly deconstructed stand-up comedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rabin|first=Nathan|title=Steve Martin: The Television Stuff|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/steve-martin-the-television-stuff,88419/|publisher=Onion Inc.|accessdate=December 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On his comedy albums, Martin's stand-up is self-referential and sometimes self-mocking. It mixes philosophical riffs with sudden spurts of "happy feet", banjo playing with balloon depictions of concepts like [[venereal disease]], and the "controversial" kitten juggling (he is a master juggler; the "kittens" were stuffed animals). His style is off-kilter and ironic and sometimes pokes fun at stand-up comedy traditions, such as Martin opening his act (from ''A Wild and Crazy Guy'') by saying: {{cquote|I think there's nothing better for a person to come up and do the same thing over and over for two weeks. This is what I enjoy, so I'm going to do the same thing over and over and over [...] I'm going to do the same joke over and over in the same show, it'll be like a new thing.}}  Or: "Hello, I'm Steve Martin, and I'll be out here in a minute."&lt;ref name="Frum"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nymag.com/arts/books/features/40968/"Rationalist of the Absurd: Steve Martin's extraordinarily calculated comedy".''New York Books'' November 18, 2007]. Retrieved August 12, 2010  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100818095622/http://nymag.com/arts/books/features/40968/ |date=August 18, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In one comedy routine, used on the ''[[Comedy Is Not Pretty!]]'' album Martin claimed that his real name was "Gern Blanston". The riff took on a life of its own. There is a Gern Blanston website, and for a time a rock band took the moniker as their name.&lt;ref&gt;Martin (2007) p176–77&lt;/ref&gt;

With this kind of outstanding success, Martin's show soon required full sized stadiums for the audiences he was drawing. Concerned about his visibility in venues on such a scale, Martin began to wear a distinctive [[three piece suit|three piece]] white suit that became a trademark for his act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=O'Reilly|first1=Terry|title=How A Wardrobe Change Transformed Steve Martin's Career|url=http://www.cbc.ca/radio/undertheinfluence/how-a-wardrobe-change-transformed-steve-martin-s-career-1.4525782|accessdate=18 February 2018|work=Under the Influence|agency=Pirate Radio|publisher=CBC Radio One|date=8 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin stopped doing stand-up comedy in 1981 to concentrate on movies and did not return for 35 years.&lt;ref name="Mild"/&gt; About this decision, he states: {{cquote|My act was conceptual. Once the concept was stated, and everybody understood it, it was done. [...] It was about coming to the end of the road. There was no way to live on in that persona. I had to take that fabulous luck of not being remembered as that, exclusively. You know, I didn't announce that I was stopping. I just stopped.&lt;ref&gt;

In 2016, Martin made a rare return to comedy, opening for [[Jerry Seinfeld]]. He performed a 10-minute routine before turning the stage over to Seinfeld.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/feb/19/jerry-seinfeld-steve-martin-review-standup-comedy-new-york|title=Jerry Seinfeld and Steve Martin standup comedy review – superbly honed|first=Elise|last=Czajkowski|date=February 19, 2016|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later in 2016 he returned to stand-up comedy, staging a national tour with [[Martin Short]] and the [[Steep Canyon Rangers]], which yielded a 2018 Netflix comedy special, "Steve Martin and Martin Short: An Evening You Will Forget for the Rest of Your Life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | last=Husband | first=Andrew | date=May 25, 2018 | title=Steve Martin And Martin Short Embrace The Past Even When They Shun It | work=[[Forbes]] | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewhusband/2018/05/25/steve-martin-martin-short-netflix-special-review/#206aa3071f44 | access-date=May 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acting career===
[[File:Steve Martin.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Martin in 1982]]
By the end of the 1970s, Martin had acquired the kind of following normally reserved for rock stars, with his tour appearances typically occurring at sold-out arenas filled with tens of thousands of screaming fans. But unknown to his audience, stand-up comedy was "just an accident" for him; his real goal was to get into film.&lt;ref name=RS/&gt;

Martin had a small role in the 1972 film ''[[Another Nice Mess]]''. His first substantial film appearance was in a [[short film|short]] titled ''[[The Absent-Minded Waiter]]'' (1977). The seven-minute-long film, also featuring [[Buck Henry]] and [[Teri Garr]], was written by and starred Martin. The film was nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] as [[Academy Award for Live Action Short Film|''Best Short Film, Live Action'']]. He made his first substantial feature film appearance in the musical ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (film)|Sgt.

In 1979, Martin starred and co-wrote with Michael Elias and Carl Gottlieb  ''[[The Jerk (film)|The Jerk]]'', directed by [[Carl Reiner]].

[[Stanley Kubrick]] met with him to discuss the possibility of Martin starring in a screwball comedy version of ''[[Dream Story|Traumnovelle]]'' (Kubrick later changed his approach to the material, the result of which was 1999's ''[[Eyes Wide Shut]]''). Martin was executive producer for ''Domestic Life'', a prime-time television series starring friend [[Martin Mull]], and a late-night series called ''Twilight Theater''. It emboldened Martin to try his hand at his first serious film, ''[[Pennies from Heaven (1981 film)|Pennies from Heaven]]'', based on the [[Pennies from Heaven (TV series)|1978 BBC serial]] by [[Dennis Potter]]. He was anxious to perform in the movie because of his desire to avoid being [[typecasting (acting)|typecast]]. To prepare for that film, Martin took acting lessons from director [[Herbert Ross]] and spent months learning how to [[tap dance]]. The film was a financial failure; Martin's comment at the time was "I don't know what to blame, other than it's me and not a comedy."&lt;ref&gt;''American film'' Volume 7. 1981.

===Music===
Martin first picked up the banjo when he was around 17 years of age. Martin has stated in several interviews and in his memoir, ''Born Standing Up'', that he used to take 33 rpm [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] records and slow them down to 16 rpm and tune his banjo down, so the notes would sound the same. Martin was able to pick out each note and perfect his playing.

Martin learned how to play the banjo with help from [[John McEuen]], who later joined the [[Nitty Gritty Dirt Band]]. McEuen's brother later managed Martin as well as the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. Martin did his stand-up routine opening for the band in the early 1970s. He had the band play on his hit song "King Tut", being credited as "The Toot Uncommons" (as in [[Tutankhamun]]).

The banjo was a staple of Martin's 1970s stand-up career, and he periodically poked fun at his love for the instrument.&lt;ref Name="Smith"/&gt; On the ''[[Comedy Is Not Pretty!]]'' album, he included an all-instrumental jam, titled "Drop Thumb Medley", and played the track on his 1979 concert tour. His final comedy album, ''[[The Steve Martin Brothers]]'' (1981), featured one side of Martin's typical stand-up material, with the other side featuring live performances of Steve playing banjo with a bluegrass band.

==Personal life==
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Martin was in a relationship with actress/singer/dancer [[Bernadette Peters]]; they co-starred in two movies, ''[[The Jerk]]'' and ''[[Pennies from Heaven (1981 film)|Pennies from Heaven]]'', during that time.

Martin married actress [[Victoria Tennant]] on November 20, 1986; they divorced in 1994.&lt;ref name=tennantbio&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.filmreference.com/film/76/Victoria-Tennant.html  | title = Victoria Tennant Biography (1950?-) | publisher = FilmReference.com | accessdate = February 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 28, 2007, after three years together, Martin married Anne Stringfield, a writer and former staffer for ''[[The New Yorker]]'' magazine.&lt;ref Name="Usat"/&gt; Former [[Nebraska]] Senator [[Bob Kerrey]] presided over the ceremony at Martin's Los Angeles home. [[Lorne Michaels]], creator of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', was best man.&lt;ref Name="Usat"/&gt; Several of the guests, including close friends [[Tom Hanks]], [[Eugene Levy]], comedian [[Carl Reiner]], and magician/actor [[Ricky Jay]], were not informed that a wedding ceremony would take place. Instead, they were told they were invited to a party and were surprised by the nuptials.&lt;ref name="Usat" &gt;{{cite news | url  = https://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2007-07-29-martin-marriage_N.htm | title = Steve Martin weds girlfriend Anne Stringfield | date = July 29, 2007 | work = [[Associated Press]] via ''[[USA Today]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2012, Martin became a father for the first time when Stringfield gave birth to a daughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://todayentertainment.today.com/_news/2013/02/13/16953788-steve-martin-becomes-first-time-dad-at-age-67?lite|title=Latest News, Videos &amp; Guest Interviews from the Today Show on NBC|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =Steve Martin a first-time dad at 67 | date = February 13, 2013 | work = [[New York Post]] | url = http://www.nypost.com/p/pagesix/steve_wild_and_crazy_dad_Ziq4vQ7zcToflzSvy2uu4J | accessdate = February 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://arts.nationalpost.com/2013/02/14/steve-martin-is-a-dad-for-the-first-time-at-age-67/ |title="Steve Martin is a dad for the first time at age 67" '&amp;#39;National Post'&amp;#39; 14 February 2013 |publisher=Arts.nationalpost.com |date= |accessdate=2017-04-06 |df=mdy-all }}{{dead link|date=April 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin has been an avid art collector since 1968, when he bought a print by the Los Angeles artist [[Ed Ruscha]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/24/arts/art-review-in-vegas-steve-martin-tries-a-different-kind-of-show.html |title=In Vegas, Steve Martin Tries a Different Kind of Show |last=Glueck |first=Grace |date=April 24, 2001 |work=New York Times |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140418092246/https://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/24/arts/art-review-in-vegas-steve-martin-tries-a-different-kind-of-show.html |archivedate=April 18, 2014 |accessdate=August 6, 2018 |deadurl=unfit}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, the [[Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art]] presented a five-month exhibit of 28 items from Martin's collection, including works by [[Roy Lichtenstein]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[David Hockney]], and [[Edward Hopper]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Snedeker (June 10, 2001), [http://articles.latimes.com/2001/jun/10/local/me-8586 Las Vegas Casinos Gamble on Art as a Crowd Pleaser] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, he sold Hopper's ''Hotel Window'' (1955)&lt;ref&gt;Carol Vogel (October 6, 2006), [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/06/arts/design/06voge.html Edward Hopper Paintings Change at Whitney Show].

Investigators at Berlin's state criminal police office (LKA) think that Martin was a victim of German art forger [[Wolfgang Beltracchi]]. In July 2004, Martin purchased what he believed to be a 1915 work by the German-Dutch painter [[Heinrich Campendonk]], ''Landschaft mit Pferden'' (''Landscape With Horses'') from a Paris gallery for what should have been a bargain price of around €700,000 (around $850,000 at the time). Before the purchase, an expert authenticated the work and identified the painter's signature on a label attached to the back. Fifteen months later, the painting was sold at auction to a Swiss businesswoman for €500,000 – a loss of €200,000. Police believe the fake Campendonk originated from an invented art collection devised by a group of German swindlers caught in 2010. Skillfully forged paintings from this group were sold to French galleries like the one where Martin bought the forgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Martin has had [[tinnitus]] (ringing in the ears) ever since filming a pistol-shooting scene for the film ''[[Three Amigos]]'' in 1986. He has been quoted as saying, "You just get used to it, or you go insane."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wallechinsky |first=David|title=The new book of lists: the original compendium of curious information|date=2005 |publisher=Canongate |location=New York |isbn=1841957194 |author2=Wallace, Amy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.utahsbesthearingaids.com/with-the-right-help-you-can-learn-to-manage-tinnitus.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024030356/http://www.utahsbesthearingaids.com/with-the-right-help-you-can-learn-to-manage-tinnitus.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=October 24, 2014|title=How to manage tinnitus|publisher=utahbesthearingaids.com|accessdate=May 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
