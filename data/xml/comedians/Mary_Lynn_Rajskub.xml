One of her childhood inspirations was the television series ''[[Moonlighting (TV series)|Moonlighting]]''. She later moved to [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], where she worked as a waitress in a [[Hard Rock Cafe]] and a ticket-taker at the Beverly Center movie theater.

==Career==
Rajskub's first part was as an [[Oompa-Loompa]] in a community theater production of ''[[Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory]]'', and her first starring role was [[Raggedy Ann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usmagazine.com/moviestvmusic/news/mary-lynn-rajskub-25-things-you-dont-know-about-me-2010211 |title=25 Things You Don't Know About Me: Mary Lynn Rajskub |publisher=UsMagazine.com |date=January 21, 2010 |accessdate=July 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996 she appeared in music videos for the songs "[[The Good Life (Weezer song)#Music video|The Good Life]]" by [[Weezer]] and "[[The New Pollution]]" by [[Beck]].

From 1996-1998, she had a recurring role on the HBO series ''[[The Larry Sanders Show]]'' as booking assistant Mary Lou Collins.

Her most notable role is [[Counter Terrorist Unit|CTU]] [[systems analyst]] [[Chloe O'Brian]] on ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'', which she joined in 2003 at the start of the show's third season. Her character was a hit with viewers and critics and was one of the few cast members to return in the show's fourth season. After being a regular guest star for two seasons, Rajskub became a main cast member in the show's fifth season. By the end of the series, she was the lead female, with top billing second only to [[Kiefer Sutherland]]. Her character also had the honor of saying the final words of the series in the season 8 series finale.

In August 2013, it was announced that she would reprise her Chloe O'Brian role in the 2014 limited series ''[[24: Live Another Day]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Tvbythenumbers/~3/VDMNV5_yXFI/ |title=Mary Lynn Rajskub Clocks in For '24: Live Another Day' |work=[[Zap2It]] |publisher=FOX press release |author=Kondolojy, Amanda |date=August 1, 2013 |accessdate=August 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rajskub was part of a comic duo (with [[Karen Kilgariff]]) called Girls Guitar Club. In 2006, she made a cameo appearance in "Partings", the [[Gilmore Girls Season 6|6th season]] finale of ''[[Gilmore Girls]]'', where she played a [[troubadour]] looking for her big break. (Rajskub had previously appeared on ''Gilmore Girls'' as the female lead in ''A Film by Kirk'', a [[short film]] made by the character [[Kirk Gleason]].) She has volunteered as an actress with the [[Young Storytellers Program]]. She has an educational background as a painter, having attended the [[San Francisco Art Institute]].

Rajskub has been nominated twice for a [[Screen Actors Guild Award]]; once in 2005, and again in 2007 for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series. She guest starred on ''[[Flight of the Conchords (TV series)|Flight of the Conchords]]'' episode "[[Prime Minister (Flight of the Conchords)|Prime Minister]]" as Karen, an Art Garfunkel fanatic. She guest starred as "Gail the Snail" in an episode of ''[[It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia]]'' titled "The Gang Gives Frank an Intervention", and reprised the role in the ninth season finale, "The Gang Squashes Their Beefs".

From July through October 2010, she performed in her solo show, ''Mary Lynn Spreads Her Legs'', at the [[Steve Allen Theater]] in Los Angeles. Reviewer F. Kathleen Foley of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote "that cheerfully vulgar title sums up the overall tone, which is often breezily obscene".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=F. Kathleen Foley |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2010/07/mary-lynn-spreads-her-legs-at-the-steve-allen.html |title=Theater review: 'Mary Lynn Spreads Her Legs' at the Steve Allen Theater |publisher=Latimesblogs.latimes.com |date=July 2, 2010 |accessdate=September 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The show, written by Rajskub with help from director/developer Amit Itelman, was inspired by Rajskub’s experiences with pregnancy, childbirth and early motherhood.

The title character is a 40-year-old woman who lives at home with her parents, makes crafts, and takes her art seriously. ''Dicki'' has been one of My Damn Channel's most successful web series to date. The first season concluded in November 2011, but a second season is currently in development.
