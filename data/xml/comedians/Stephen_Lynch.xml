He received a theater scholarship to attend [[The Catholic University of America]] in Washington, D.C. before transferring in 1990&lt;ref name = "Stephen Lynch's 'triumphant return' Barn Theatre"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mlive.com/entertainment/kalamazoo/index.ssf/2010/08/stephen_lynchs_triumphant_retu.html|title=Stephen Lynch's 'triumphant return' Barn Theatre alum, comedian to play dirty songs for venue fundraiser|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Western Michigan University]] where he graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in drama in 1993.

==Career==

===Early career===
After spending his first year out of college with friends in California,&lt;ref name="M &amp; C"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arts.monstersandcritics.com/features/article_1166663.php/Stephen_Lynch_From_comic_songster_to_Wedding_Singer|title=Monsters and Critics: Stephen Lynch: From comic songster to 'Wedding Singer'|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060824135936/http://arts.monstersandcritics.com/features/article_1166663.php/Stephen_Lynch_From_comic_songster_to_Wedding_Singer|archivedate=August 24, 2006|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lynch moved to New York City in 1996 with the intention of becoming an actor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/story/415137p-350834c.html|title=''New York Daily News'', "'Wedding' Zinger"|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060517141525/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/story/415137p-350834c.html|archivedate=May 17, 2006|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his arrival, a friend at the [[Laurie Beechman Theatre|West Bank Cafe]] on 42nd Street suggested Lynch play, for an audience, some of the comic songs he had written while attending university.&lt;ref name = "ZPincus-Roth" /&gt; He soon found success in comedy clubs and other venues around the city (notably [[Catch a Rising Star (comedy clubs)|Catch a Rising Star]]&lt;ref name = "What Are Records?" /&gt; and [[Caroline's]]&lt;ref name="Stephen Lynch: Tour History"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stephenlynch.com/tour/history.html|title=Stephen Lynch: Tour History|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060509054757/http://www.stephenlynch.com/tour/history.html|archivedate=May 9, 2006|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and became a regular on radio shows such as ''[[Opie and Anthony]]''.&lt;ref name="What Are Records?" &gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whatarerecords.com|title=What Are Records?|website=www.whatarerecords.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stephen Lynch: Press" /&gt; Lynch spent his early years in New York City doing what he called "totally mindless work" as a temp worker. He quit such temporary jobs permanently, signing with [[What Are Records?]] in 2000 and Vision International in 2002.

Over the next few years, he toured colleges, universities and [[nightclubs]] around the country, avoiding as much as possible the [[comedy club]] circuit, which he has stated is not to his taste. He periodically returned to Michigan to do [[summer stock]].&lt;ref name = "WMA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Playbill" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://video.broadwayworld.com/showvideos/weddingseattle.html|title=Untitled Document|website=video.broadwayworld.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his March 6, 2009 appearance on ''[[The Bob and Tom Show]]'', Lynch mentioned "Steel Toast" as the name of the band in which he first performed. As of the start of his 3 Balloons tour in Spring 2009, [[Agency for the Performing Arts]] books all of his concert dates.&lt;ref name="M &amp; C" /&gt;

===2000 to present===
As a result of the duality of his act, Lynch turned heads in the music industry as well as on the comedy circuit. He attracted extra attention usually not available to comics by playing venues more often suited to music than to comedy (eventually graduating to locations such as the [[House of Blues]], [[The Town Hall]]&lt;ref name = "UGO" /&gt; and the esteemed [[Carnegie Hall]]).&lt;ref name = "Stephen Lynch: Tour History" /&gt; He gained great national exposure with his ''[[Comedy Central Presents]]'' special in 2000, one of the highest rated in the network's history. He has made appearances on ''[[Comedy Central]]'''s ''[[Premium Blend]]'', ''The World Comedy Tour'' and ''The World Stands Up''. He has also made four appearances on ''[[Last Call with Carson Daly]]'', and has performed at the prestigious ''[[Just for Laughs]]'' Comedy Festival in [[Montreal, Quebec]], Canada.&lt;ref name = "Stephen Lynch: Press" /&gt;

Lynch has opened for comedians [[Jay Mohr]], [[Jeff Foxworthy]], [[Steven Wright]], [[Bobcat Goldthwait]] and [[Lewis Black]]. In the summer of 2004, he went on a tour co-headlining with [[Mitch Hedberg]]. The tour was such a success that they added an extra leg and ran into 2005. This was Hedberg's last tour before his death.

He has also appeared in five short films, including ''The Love Seat'' in 1999 and ''The Confetti Brothers'' in 2001.&lt;ref name = "WMA" &gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wma.com/stephen_lynch/summary/|title=WME|website=www.wma.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1392557/|title=Stephen Lynch|website=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Broadway.com" /&gt; Both films were written and directed by Kirker Butler. ''The Confetti Brothers'', a satire, screened to packed houses at the 2001 [[Cannes Film Festival]]. It continues to play the film festival circuit.&lt;ref name = "courier-journal.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courier-journal.com/scene/movies/features/2002/20020702butler.html|title=courier-journal.com: Louisville Scene: Hollywood's Kentucky connection adds a link|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2006, Lynch starred as Robbie Hart in the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musical ''[[The Wedding Singer (musical)|The Wedding Singer]]'', which ran on Broadway from April 27, 2006 through December 31, 2006 at the [[Al Hirschfeld Theatre]].&lt;ref name = "ZPincus-Roth" /&gt; This musical production was based on the 1998 [[New Line Cinema]] film ''[[The Wedding Singer]]'' starring [[Adam Sandler]] and [[Drew Barrymore]]. The musical, Lynch's Broadway debut,&lt;ref name = "ZPincus-Roth" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Broadway.com" &gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadway.com/gen/Buzz_Star_File.aspx?ci=519869|title=Broadway Buzz - Videos, Interviews, Photos, News and Tickets - Broadway.com|website=www.broadway.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; co-starred [[Tony Award|Tony]] winner [[Laura Benanti]] in the role of Julia Sullivan, played by Barrymore in the film. The April 2006 opening followed a successful preview run in [[Seattle]] at [[5th Avenue Theatre|The 5th Avenue Theatre]] which ran from January 31 through February 19. His performance has earned him nominations for [[Tony Award|Tony]], [[Drama League Award|Drama League]] and [[Drama Desk Award|Drama Desk]] awards,&lt;ref name = "Playbill" /&gt; According to interviews after, he stated that, due to the rehearsals for the show, he had forgotten most of his own songs.

In 2007, Lynch returned to the road again, touring with comedians such as [[Bob Saget]], [[Frank Caliendo]], [[Louis C.K.]], [[Carlos Mencia]] and others on the [[Opie and Anthony's Traveling Virus Comedy Tour]] during [[Opie and Anthony's Traveling Virus Comedy Tour (2007)|2007]].

Lynch starred in his second ''[[Comedy Central Presents]]'' special in January 2008.

Lynch performed on his first European tours in 2008, headlining concerts in England, [[Sweden]], [[Norway]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Finland]], Ireland, [[Scotland]] and Germany. All but two of the seventeen shows sold out, despite never playing a majority of the markets. Lynch attributes this success to YouTube.

His newfound European popularity resulted in appearances at six festivals in August and September 2008. He played in the UK at the [[Reading and Leeds Festivals]], headlining the Alternative stage at each site. He also appeared at the [[Lowlands Festival]] in the Netherlands on August 17, [[Edinburgh]] Edge Festival (during [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe|Fringe]]) on August 24, The Pimm's Summerfest in [[Holland Park]], London on August 28, and Bulmer's Comedy Festival in [[Dublin]] at the Olympia Theater on September 1 and 2. He returned to Europe in Fall, 2009 and toured the UK in March 2010, headlining London's [[Brixton Academy]] on March 5, 2010. Lynch's second studio album, ''[[3 Balloons]]'', was released on March 10, 2009.

In June 2011, among other venues, Lynch performed at Kulturens Hus in [[Luleå]], Sweden.

On March 6, 2011, while replying to a message on Twitter, Lynch announced that he was working on a new CD. When asked if it would be studio or live, he replied "I'm leaning studio." ''[[Lion (Stephen Lynch album)|Lion]]'', a double live/studio album, was released on November 13, 2012 to solid reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stephen Lynch Lion album review|url=http://www.thespittake.com/2012/11/13/stephen-lynch-lion-what-are-records/|accessdate=April 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "whatarerecords.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whatarerecords.com/stephen_lynch/bio.html|title=What Are Records? - Stephen Lynch: bio|website=whatarerecords.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
He married Erin Dwight on a private beach on [[Lake Michigan]] in September 2003,&lt;ref name="Playbill" /&gt; and she is generally the first person to hear his original ideas for songs;  if she does not laugh at the initial concept, he will scrap the idea completely.&lt;ref name="Recoil" /&gt; Dwight recorded a short film while her husband was away touring, called ''Lynch and Teich in Brooklyn'', to show that she missed him. This was included in the extras on his 2004 concert DVD, ''[[Live at the El Rey (DVD)|Live at the El Rey]]''. She also co-created the cover concept for the album, ''[[The Craig Machine]]'', with her mother, [[Kalamazoo, Michigan|Kalamazoo]] photographer Fran Dwight.

Lynch has a younger brother, Drew (not standup comic [[Drew Lynch]], who is unrelated). Lynch and his brother occasionally tour together. Their parents are a former priest and a former [[nun]].&lt;ref name="M &amp; C" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first=Andrew| last=Guyton| url=http://www.nique.net/issues/2005-11-18/entertainment/2| title=Stephen Lynch satisfies with Craig Machine| work=[[The Technique]]| date=November 18, 2005| accessdate=2007-04-04 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929141144/http://www.nique.net/issues/2005-11-18/entertainment/2 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate=September 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both parents became teachers.&lt;ref name="ZPincus-Roth" /&gt; Lynch has stated that religion was not forced upon him growing up, and, although he was raised [[Roman Catholic]], he no longer attends church. His upbringing included liberalism as well as religion, which is reflected through his father's past as part of a singing duo that attended many peace rallies and antiwar protests during the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name="M &amp; C" /&gt; Like his sons, Lynch's father was a stage actor as well as a singer, and musical talent and interest runs in their family. Lynch's earliest work in the theater was performing with his father in local community theater productions in Saginaw as a child. The first live musical he saw was ''[[Man of La Mancha]]'', a community theater production in which his father played the role of the Padre.&lt;ref name="ZPincus-Roth" &gt;{{cite web|url=http://zpincusroth.typepad.com/blog/2006/02/one_to_watch_st.html|title=One to Watch: Stephen Lynch|website=Zachary Pincus-Roth.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Playbill" &gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/celebritybuzz/article/99485.html|title=Playbill Celebrity Buzz: THE LEADING MEN: The Ring and I|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Lynch's repertoire of material includes some duets and also a few songs for three voices, close university pals and fellow comedians Mark Teich (of [[The Second City]]) and Rod Cone (of The Rod Cone Situation) are also very frequent guests on his tours, and he rarely tours alone. He has also done shows with former ''Wedding Singer'' castmate David Josefsberg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lynch-mob.net|title=Lynch-mob.net|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050323233110/http://lynch-mob.net/|archivedate=March 23, 2005|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of July 2008, Lynch resides in [[Kalamazoo]], Michigan with his wife.

Lynch's father Leo died October 9, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.obitmichigan.com/Obituary/767/Leo-Lynch|title=Leo R. Lynch Born: August 27th, 1931 Remembered: October 9th, 2009|website=www.obitmichigan.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he canceled several performances as a result, Lynch still performed at [[Central Michigan University]] on October 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cm-life.com/article/2009/10/stephen-lynch-show-a-hit|title=Stephen Lynch show a hit|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Lynch appeared on ''[[The Opie and Anthony Show]]'' on [[Sirius Satellite Radio|Sirius197]] XM202 The Virus, on October 19, 2009. He stated he finally returned to his New York apartment after spending the last year in Michigan with his wife. During a subsequent appearance on May 2, 2013, to promote ''Lion'', Lynch stated that he had returned to Michigan after a financial downturn and creative dry spell.
