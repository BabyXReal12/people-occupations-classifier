'''Charles Joseph McDonnell''' (born 1 October 1990) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[vlogger]], musician, [[filmmaker]], and author from [[Bath, Somerset]].&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; On 15 June 2011, his [[YouTube]] channel ''charlieissocoollike'' became the first in the [[UK]] to reach one million subscribers, and in May 2013, his channel reached two million subscribers. As a musician, McDonnell was a member of ''[[Doctor Who]]''-themed rock band [[Chameleon Circuit (band)|Chameleon Circuit]] and was also a member of the short-lived project [[Sons of Admirals]] until it was disbanded in May 2011. In 2010, McDonnell released his debut solo album, titled ''This Is Me''. McDonnell began directing short films in May 2013, and co-hosted the weekday morning [[YouTube]] [[breakfast show]] ''Cereal Time'' with fellow YouTube vlogger Jimmy Hill from 2015 to 2016.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOGelyFJnrzeNWh0y5JfZOQ&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, he published his first book, ''Fun Science''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thebookseller.com/news/youtubers-fun-science-debut-quadrille-323795|title=YouTuber's 'Fun Science' debut to Quadrille {{!}} The Bookseller|website=www.thebookseller.com|access-date=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early and personal life==
McDonnell was born and raised in [[Bath, Somerset]] to parents Lindsey and Mark. He has two younger siblings: his brother, William, and his sister, Bridie. He was educated at [[Beechen Cliff School]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisisbath.co.uk/news/Charlie-s-good/article-368021-detail/article.html Charlie McDonnell profile]. Thisisbath.co.uk (2008-10-01). Retrieved on 2011-12-28.&lt;/ref&gt; a state comprehensive [[foundation school]] in Bath. He identifies as an [[atheist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McDonnell|first=Charlie|title=Hotness Points|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4yy94mJnC0|work=YouTube|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=28 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; McDonnell used to live with fellow video blogger [[Alex Day]], but later lived in his own apartment in [[London]] with his girlfriend. In June 2017, he moved to [[Canada]] (his girlfriend's homeland), where he will stay for at least two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McDonnell|first1=Charlie|title=So… I know you'll think I'm joking when I say "I'm moving to Canada!" given the current state of the UK.

In July 2012, McDonnell made a video announcing his relationship with then-girlfriend, fellow YouTuber, Bryarly Bishop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McDonnell|first=Charlie|title=My Public Relationship|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDZ4NCzxRPs|work=YouTube|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They broke up in June 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McDonnell|first=Charlie|title=My (Slightly Less) Public Breakup|url=http://charliemcdonnell.com/my-public-breakup/|work=charliemcdonnell.com|publisher=Charlie McDonnell|accessdate=16 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Charlie's current girlfriend is Emily Diana Ruth, a fellow YouTuber and filmmaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McDonnell|first=Charlie|title=The Inevitability Of Change (I Moved Out)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHelQpOFueA|work=YouTube|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=16 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McDonnell|first=Charlie|title=Impromptu trip to Brighton with Emily means obnoxiously cute selfie.

In March 2014, McDonnell announced on his blog that he has terminated his friendship and cohabitation with Alex Day, stating that "I just don’t feel able to call Alex a friend of mine anymore", following allegations that Alex sexually manipulated, emotionally abused, and cheated on past girlfriends.&lt;ref&gt;[http://charliemcdonnell.com/sexual-abuse-consent-and-losing-friends/ "Sexual Abuse, Consent, and Losing Friends" - charliemcdonnell.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Butterly|first=Amelia|title=Vlogger admits 'manipulative relationships with women'|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/26664725|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC Newsbeat|accessdate=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==YouTube==
After setting up the YouTube channel, ''charlieissocoollike'' on 3 April 2007, McDonnell started posting [[video blog]]s (or ''vlogs'') to a small audience. He first came to prominence when his video titled ''How To Get Featured on YouTube'' became popular after it was featured on YouTube's UK homepage. His audience jumped from just under 150 subscribers to over 4,000 in two days.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVPzmtGD80 The day in a life of series: Charlie is so cool like]&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2008, in celebration of gaining 25,000 subscribers, McDonnell asked for challenge suggestions from subscribers, and he is completing them in a series of 25 videos titled ''Challenge Charlie''. He has completed all of these challenges {{as of|2013|03|lc=on}}, one of which was suggested by TV presenter, [[Phillip Schofield]], and his daughter Molly, challenging McDonnell to perform the dance that accompanies the song, [[Hoedown Throwdown]], made popular in the film [[Hannah Montana: The Movie]]. McDonnell has since posted a wide range of videos on the site including his most viewed ''My American Accent''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1564707/Schoolboy%27s-%27how-to-be-English%27-guide-a-US-hit.html|title=Schoolboy's 'how to be English' guide a US hit|last=Paris|first=Natalie|date=2 October 2007|publisher=Telegraph|accessdate=24 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, McDonnell participated in a video-blog collaboration with four other YouTube personalities, titled ''FiveAwesomeGuys'', a spin-off project of the ''FiveAwesomeGirls'' which featured ''hayleyghoover'' and ''italktosnakes'' and ran from 28 January to 31 December of that year. In May 2009, McDonnell created an alternate YouTube account, ''CharlieAtE3'', which followed McDonnell when he traveled to [[E3 2009]]. In January 2010 McDonnell created another alternate YouTube channel, ''charlieissoboredlike'', for the videos he makes when he has nothing better to do.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/user/charlieissoboredlike Kanaal van charlieissoboredlike]. YouTube (2010-01-25). Retrieved on 2011-12-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2011, McDonnell became the first YouTuber in the United Kingdom to ever reach 1 million subscribers. McDonnell's videos currently end with an [[epilogue|outro]] by [[Stephen Fry]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIussgh00j8|title=Comic Con Vloggin'|last=McDonnell |first=Charlie |publisher=YouTube|date=24 July 2009|accessdate=25 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; now also inclusive with a ''quali-tea'' stamp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWWRD-tkvSg|title=This Week In...|last=McDonnell |first=Charlie |publisher=YouTube|date=1 June 2012|accessdate=23 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2013, McDonnell hit two million subscribers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.twitter.com/coollike/status/330586460757561345 |title=Twitter / @coollike: Thanks to everyone who wished ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 March 2013, McDonnell announced that he would be making five short films, in preparation for the feature film that he is currently writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DPlCUd_0BQ |title=I'm Excited |last=McDonnell |first=Charlie |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=8 March 2013 |accessdate=11 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a video published on 27 October 2014, he announced his last two films would actually be one film, split into two parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BlZsPmsxmo |title=Thank You :) |last=McDonnell |first=Charlie |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=27 October 2014 |accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musical history==

===Chameleon Circuit===
{{Main|Chameleon Circuit (band)}}

[[File:ChamCirc VidCon 2011 4.jpg|thumb|McDonnell performing with Chameleon Circuit at [[VidCon]] 2011.]]
McDonnell is one of the founding members of Chameleon Circuit, a band known for creating music inspired by the British television series ''[[Doctor Who]]''. Along with fellow vloggers [[Alex Day]] ''Nerimon'' on YouTube'', ''Liam Dryden'' ''Littleradge'', and former member Chris Beattie (''CowInParachute''), Chameleon Circuit released their self-titled debut album on 1 June 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Music – Chameleon Circuit – DFTBA Records LLC |url=http://dftba.com/shop/categories/Music/Chameleon-Circuit/ |publisher=DFTBA records |accessdate=7 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100403201219/http://dftba.com/shop/categories/Music/Chameleon-Circuit |archivedate=3 April 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2010, their song ''Count the Shadows'' also appeared on ''DFTBA Records, Volume Two'', a compilation sampler that was given for free in the grab bags at [[VidCon]] 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Available for FREE, exclusively at VidCon |url=http://dailybooth.com/alandistro/4981569 |accessdate=14 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100523220934/http://dailybooth.com/alandistro/4981569 |archivedate=23 May 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of 2011, Chameleon Circuit, in their new line-up following the departure of Beattie and the addition of Ed Blann (''Eddplant'') and [[Michael aranda|Michael Aranda]], began work on their second album ''[[Still Got Legs]]''. It was released on 12 July 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Music – Chameleon Circuit – DFTBA Records LLC |url=http://dftba.com/shop/categories/Music/Chameleon-Circuit/ |publisher=DFTBA records |accessdate=15 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100403201219/http://dftba.com/shop/categories/Music/Chameleon-Circuit |archivedate=3 April 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2014, Chameleon Circuit have been on an apparent indefinite hiatus, after both McDonnell and Dryden publicly denounced members Blann and Day, who have both suspended their online careers following separate reported incidents of sexual abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sexual Abuse, Consent, and Losing Friends |url=http://charliemcdonnell.com/sexual-abuse-consent-and-losing-friends/ |publisher=Charlie McDonnell  |accessdate=13 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Liam Dryden • On This Week. |url=http://liamdryden.tumblr.com/post/79554089056/on-this-week |accessdate=13 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; McDonnell, Dryden and Aranda appeared together at VidCon 2014 for photo signings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Signings - VidCon 2014 |url=http://vidcon.com/signings |publisher=VidCon 2014 |accessdate=13 July 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714203143/http://vidcon.com/signings |archivedate=14 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sons of Admirals===
In 2010, McDonnell, along with three other YouTubers, [[Alex Day]] ("nerimon"), Ed Blann ("eddplant") and Tom Milsom ("Hexachordal") formed a new project titled "Sons of Admirals". Their first single was released via YouTube on 14 June 2010 on McDonnell's channel. The group covered [[Cat Stevens|Cat Steven]]s' song "[[Here Comes My Baby (Cat Stevens song)|Here Comes My Baby]]" featuring all four members on vocals. The track peaked at No.&amp;nbsp;61 in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.polyhex.com polyhex]. polyhex. Retrieved on 2011-12-28.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br&gt;In October 2010 the band released an EP including "Here Comes My Baby"; an acoustic version of the same song; a cover of "Believe in Yourself", the theme of children's television show ''[[Arthur (TV series)|Arthur]]''; the music video of "Here Comes My Baby"; and a behind-the-scenes video. The band has been known to perform a cover of "You're Not There", written by Ed Blann, and a cover of [[Radiohead]]'s "[[Creep (Radiohead song)|Creep]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/here-comes-my-baby-ep/id399010503 iTunes – Music – Here Comes My Baby – EP by Sons of Admirals]. Itunes.apple.com (2010-10-25). Retrieved on 2011-12-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sons of Admirals was not a band in the traditional sense. They were all solo artists, but as well as having their solo careers, they came together to form one group. The idea and name inspiration for this came from the [[Admiral's Men]], which was a [[Shakespeare]]an group of actors that came together to perform, while still retaining their individual careers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slIyXbXYX4o Sons of Admirals on The 5:19 Show!]. YouTube. Retrieved on 2011-12-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sons of Admirals disbanded in May 2011, publishing a statement on their website that "the core goal of the group – to get into the charts, and to increase exposure for the group members' individual talents proved to run against too many of our beliefs and approaches to music and promotion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sonsofadmirals.com/|title=Sons of Admirals Website|accessdate=24 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solo career===

A prominent feature of McDonnell's YouTube channel are the songs which he writes and performs himself, usually on a ukulele, but also featuring other instruments such as the guitar, melodica, and—in one song—a kazoo and a xylophone made of filled water glasses.  The most popular of these is "Duet with Myself."  On 1 December 2010, in response to many fan requests to do so, he released his debut album titled ''This is Me'' via [[DFTBA Records]].  The album features several songs from his channel that was remixed for the album, as well as several new, previously unreleased songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=This is Me (CD)|url=http://dftba.com/product/wz/This-Is-Me-CD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 January 2012 McDonnell posted a video of him singing an original song ''Time To Reply'' on his YouTube channel, which received highly positive feedback.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

In 2014, McDonnell’s YouTube Channel, charlieissocoollike,  was listed on [[New Media Rockstars]] Top 100 Channels, ranked at #63.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The NMR Top 100 YouTube Channels: 75-51!|url= http://newmediarockstars.com/2014/12/the-nmr-top-100-youtube-channels-75-51/|website=New Media Rockstars|accessdate=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music videos===
* Here Comes My Baby (2010)
* Forever Yours (2011)

[[Alex Day]] (a.k.a. [[nerimon]]), has released a number of tracks on YouTube as music videos, such as the highly popular [[Forever Yours (Alex Day song)|Forever Yours]], which peaked at number 4 in the UK charts. The music videos for a number of these were directed by McDonnell, some even starring him or featuring him at some point in the video.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

==Charity and media work==
On 30 September 2008, to celebrate his 18th birthday, McDonnell and Alex Day dyed and then shaved their hair off whilst live on [[BlogTV]] for a period of seven and a half hours in aid of [[Cancer Research UK]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisisbath.co.uk/news/winnersarticle-579579-details/article.html |title=The Bath Chronicle |date=1 January 2009 |accessdate=22 April 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090804085850/http://www.thisisbath.co.uk/news/winnersarticle-579579-details/article.html |archivedate=4 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They managed to raise nearly £5000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://justgiving.com/blogtvbirthday|title=Just Giving|accessdate=22 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The broadcast viewership peaked at 4,500. Another friend, Jazza John (known as ''rhymingwithoranges'' on YouTube) promised to shave his head if they hit £4000 and did so about a month later with help from Kristina Horner (known as ''italktosnakes'' and ''Monday'' on the YouTube collab-channel ''fiveawesomegirls'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ws_7VYGoIjQ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2009, McDonnell was named as one of a number of prominent YouTube users who would be participating in a project called ''RNLI Shout''.  The aim of the project is to raise money to purchase a lifeboat for the [[Royal National Lifeboat Institution]].

On 4 September 2010, McDonnell and fellow YouTuber Myles Dyer co-presented Stickaid, a 24-hour live web show. Starting from 12:00 noon [[British Summer Time|BST]], the two hosted the fifth annual charity event from [[Middlesex University|Middlesex University's]] Trent Park campus in London. Their goal was to raise £10,000 ($15,900), which they more than doubled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justgiving.com/stickaid2010/|title=Just Giving|accessdate=5 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; All the proceedings went to [[UNICEF]].

===The Science of Attraction===
In November 2010, McDonnell was part of a group of YouTube videos called ''The Science of Attraction'' where he hosted a few experiments and had his body digitally swapped with somebody else's. He was a co-presenter with Kat Akingbade and Derren Brown. As part of the series, eight videos were produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yosfPU3dWgc |title=Familiar Faces - Science of Attraction |author=Science of Attraction |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=4 November 2010 |accessdate=11 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Chartjackers}}
In the autumn of 2009, McDonnell featured with three other YouTube users on the [[BBC Switch]] documentary series ''[[Chartjackers]]''. The programme documented their attempt to achieve a number one single in the [[UK Singles Chart]] within 10 weeks, by [[crowdsourcing]] resources provided by the [[online community]]. McDonnell was cast in the series for his familiarity to young British YouTube viewers and to act as a [[Pied Piper]] to the teen audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/commissioning/tv/network/genres/entertainment_detail.shtml|title=Entertainment Development Priorities|publisher=BBC  |location=London|accessdate=14 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the course of ''Chartjackers'', McDonnell solicited lyrics, music, performers and stylists to record the final single and video via a YouTube channel named ''ChartJackersProject''. An unofficial [[charity single]] for [[Children in Need]], the completed song was titled [[I've Got Nothing]] and was sung by vocalists [[Miranda Chartrand and Adam Nichols]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Episode 6|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFoBwlOv-70|series=Chartjackers|network=[[BBC]]|station=BBC Two |location=UK|airdate=17 October 2009|seriesno=1|number=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; McDonnell edited the single's official music video,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Episode 7|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baXD5a4-yHg|series=Chartjackers|network=[[BBC]]|station=BBC Two |location=UK|airdate=24 October 2009|seriesno=1|number=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was shown nationwide on British [[Music television|music channels]] such as [[4Music]] and [[Viva (UK &amp; Ireland)|Viva]].

Astronomer [[Phil Plait]] wrote an article for Slate.com ("Charlie Talks Saturn," 8 December 2012) to rave about McDonnell's ongoing series of science videos, including "Fun Science: Saturn," on which Plait gave him some assistance.  Plait found McDonnell to be a "science nerd" and a "really nice guy" who makes "engaging, silly and fun" videos that reach lots of young people who "need to find their own love of science."
