'''Danny Thomas''' (born '''Amos Muzyad Yakhoob Kairouz'''; January 6, 1912 &amp;ndash; February 6, 1991) was an American [[nightclub performer|nightclub]] comedian, singer, actor, and producer whose career spanned five decades. He created and starred in one of the most successful and long-running [[sitcom|situation comedies]] in the history of American network television, in addition to guest roles on many of the comedy, talk, and musical variety programs of his time, and his legacy includes a lifelong dedication to fundraising for charity.

Thomas’s long career began in films in 1947, playing opposite child actress [[Margaret O'Brien]] in ''[[The Unfinished Dance]]'' (1947) and ''[[Big City (1948 film)|Big City]]'' (1948). He then starred in the long-running television sitcom ''[[Make Room for Daddy]]'' (also known as ''The Danny Thomas Show'') (1953–1964), in which he played the lead role of Danny Williams.  He was also the founder of [[St. Jude Children's Research Hospital]]. He is the father of [[Marlo Thomas]], Terre Thomas, and [[Tony Thomas (producer)|Tony Thomas]].&lt;ref&gt;Obituary ''[[Variety Obituaries|Variety]]'', February 11, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
[[File:Early photo of Danny Thomas.JPG|thumb|left|As "Amos Jacobs" at WMBC radio in Detroit]]

One of 10 children, Danny Thomas was born as '''Amos Muzyad Yakhoob Kairouz''' on January 6, 1912, in [[Deerfield, Michigan]], to Charles Yakhoob Kairouz and his wife Margaret Taouk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/26/Danny-Thomas.html |title=Danny Thomas Biography (1912–1991) |publisher=Filmreference.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents were [[Maronite Church|Maronite Catholic]] immigrants from [[Lebanon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DANNY THOMAS, 79, A COMEDIAN WHO CHAMPIONED A CAUSE|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=PI&amp;s_site=philly&amp;p_multi=PI&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB2A17CD6FF7E80&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|website=The Philadelphia Inquirer|date=February 7, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kairouz and Taouk are two prominent families from [[Deir el Ahmar]].  Thomas was raised in [[Toledo, Ohio]], attending St. Francis de Sales Church ([[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]]), [[Woodward High School (Toledo, Ohio)|Woodward High School]], and finally [[the University of Toledo]], where he was a member of [[Tau Kappa Epsilon]] fraternity.&lt;ref name="ThomasDavidson1992"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thomas|first1=Danny|last2=Davidson|first2=Bill |title=Make Room for Danny|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4I3c1kRXp9kC|year=1991|publisher=Putnam|isbn=9780399135668}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thomas was [[Confirmation (Catholic Church)|confirmed]] in the Catholic Church by the bishop of Toledo, [[Samuel Stritch]].  Stritch, a native of Tennessee, was a lifelong spiritual advisor for Thomas, and advised him to locate the St. Jude Hospital in Memphis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://stjude.org/stjude/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=d7e8fa3186e70110VgnVCM1000001e0215acRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=bc67ef9e87018010VgnVCM1000000e2015acRCRD |title=Danny's Dream |publisher=Stjude.org |date= |accessdate=2011-01-14 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sanderson |first=Jane |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20073527,00.html |title=St. Jude Children's Hospital Was Danny Thomas' Dream, but Dr. Alvin Mauer Makes It Come True |publisher=People.com |date=1979-04-30 |accessdate=2011-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He married Rose Marie Cassaniti in 1936, a week after his 24th birthday.

In 1932, Thomas began performing on radio in Detroit at [[WDTK|WMBC]] on ''The Happy Hour Club''.  Thomas first performed under his [[Anglicisation|anglicized]] birth name, "Amos Jacobs Kairouz." After he moved to Chicago in 1940, Thomas did not want his friends and family to know he went back into working clubs where the salary was better, so he came up with the pseudonym "Danny Thomas" (after two of his brothers).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/07/obituaries/danny-thomas-79-the-tv-star-of-make-room-for-daddy-dies.html?pagewanted=2&amp;src=pm|title=Danny Thomas, 79, the TV Star Of 'Make Room for Daddy,' Dies|date=7 February 1991|website=The New York Times|accessdate=29 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was living in Ward 6, Toledo, Lucas County, Ohio, according to the 1920 U. S. Census as Amos Jacobs, the same in the 1930 Census, and in 1940 living in Ward 2, Detroit, Wayne County, Michigan, as Amos J. Jacobs, a radio and theatrical artist. Further, the 1930 Census states his parents were born in Syria; while the 1920 Census states that they were born in "Seria", and that their mother tongue is "Serian".&lt;ref&gt;''see'' {{cite web|title=1920 Census|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:MD5X-RPQ|website=familysearch.org|accessdate=9 July 2016}} ''and'' {{cite web|title=1930 Census|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:X44C-622|website=familysearch.org|accessdate=9 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Lebanon was part of the Ottoman Empire until 1920, and Lebanese immigrants were then identified as Syrians in most of the world and as Turks in Latin America.

==Careers other than television==
[[File:Danny thomas jerry dingle baby snooks 1945.JPG|thumb|Thomas as Jerry Dingle, 1945]]

===Radio===
Thomas first reached mass audiences on network radio in the 1940s playing shifty brother-in-law Amos in ''[[The Bickersons]]'', which began as sketches on the music-comedy show ''[[Drene Time]]'', starring  [[Don Ameche]] and [[Frances Langford]]. Thomas also portrayed himself as a scatterbrained Lothario on this show. His other network radio work included a stint as Jerry Dingle the postman on [[Fanny Brice]]'s ''[[The Baby Snooks Show]]''. In the early 1950s he made several appearances on the popular NBC variety program, ''[[The Big Show (NBC Radio)|The Big Show]]'', hosted by stage legend [[Tallulah Bankhead]].

Thomas also had his own radio program, ''The Danny Thomas Show''. The 30-minute weekly variety show was on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in 1942-43 and on [[CBS]] in 1947-48.&lt;ref name="sies1"&gt;Sies, Luther F. (2014). ''Encyclopedia of American Radio, 1920-1960, 2nd Edition, Volume 1''. McFarland &amp; Company, Inc. {{ISBN|978-0-7864-5149-4}}. P. 177.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Films===
After his two late 1940s films with [[Margaret O'Brien]], Thomas appeared with [[Betty Grable]] in the musical ''[[Call Me Mister (film)|Call Me Mister]]'' (1951). He then starred in ''[[The Jazz Singer (1952 film)|The Jazz Singer]]'' opposite the popular contemporary vocalist [[Peggy Lee]], a 1952 remake of [[The Jazz Singer|the 1927 original]]. He also portrayed songwriter [[Gus Kahn]] opposite [[Doris Day]] in the [[1951 in film|1951]] film biography ''[[I'll See You in My Dreams (1951 film)|I'll See You in My Dreams]].''

=== Music ===
In 1952, Thomas recorded several Arabic folk songs with Toufic Barham for a Saint Jude Hospital Foundation fundraiser record. The songs later appeared on the re-issue album '' The Music of Arab-Americans: A Retrospective Collection''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-music-of-arab-americans-a-retrospective-collection-mw0000234368 The Music of Arab-Americans: A Retrospective Collection]. allmusic.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kligman, Mark (2001).

Ethnomusicology, Vol. 45, No.1. pp 186-187.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1952 through 1974, Thomas also recorded a number of vocal albums on his own, as well as participating on other albums.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.discogs.com/artist/1838997-Danny-Thomas-4 Danny Thomas discography]. discogs.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Television career==

===''Make Room For Daddy'' (''The Danny Thomas Show'')===
Thomas enjoyed a successful 11-year run (1953–1964) on ''Make Room For Daddy,'' later known as ''The Danny Thomas Show''. [[Jean Hagen]] and [[Sherry Jackson]] were his first family. The Hagen character died in 1956, replaced by [[Marjorie Lord]]. Jackson left the series in 1958, and Penny Parker replaced her in the 1959-1960 series. Parker was written out of the series with her marriage to the character Patrick Hannigan, played by comedian [[Pat Harrington, Jr.]] Lord and Harrington died a few weeks apart between November 2015 and January 2016.

On January 1, 1959, Thomas appeared with his other ''Make Room For Daddy'' child stars, [[Angela Cartwright]] and the late [[Rusty Hamer]], in an episode of [[NBC]]'s ''[[The Ford Show|The Ford Show, Starring Tennessee Ernie Ford]].''

[[File:Danny Thomas Angela Cartwright.JPG|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Danny plays house with television daughter Linda ([[Angela Cartwright]]). ]] 
The show was produced at Desilu Studios, where [[Lucille Ball]] was appearing alongside [[Desi Arnaz|Desi Arnaz Sr.]] in ''[[I Love Lucy]],'' and it featured several guest stars who went on to star in their own shows, including [[Andy Griffith]] (''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'', ''Mayberry RFD''), [[Joey Bishop]], and [[Bill Bixby]] (''[[My Favorite Martian]]'' and others). He also scored a major success at the London Palladium, in the years when many big American stars appeared there.
[[File:DThomas.jpg|thumb|Thomas and Cartwright]]

In 1970, the program was revived for a season under the title ''Make Room for Granddaddy.'' (See below.)

Angela Cartwright (who spoke about her on- and off-camera relationship with her TV stepfather, Danny Thomas, on a groundbreaking ABC TV show, ''Make Room for Daddy'') had said: "I thought Danny was hilarious and he was always cracking me up. He was loud and gregarious, nothing like my real Dad who is far more reserved than that. So, it was fun to be able to make smart remarks and get away with it. I would never have talked to my real parents that way, but in the make-believe world of the Williams family I got away with that." Cartwright also added that by the time Thomas' show had ended, she wanted to join the cast of ''[[The Sound of Music]]'': "I went on an interview for the part of Brigitta. I was still filming ''The Danny Thomas Show'', but I knew the series was coming to an end. After several auditions, I was the first von Trapp cast. I asked Danny Thomas if he would let me out of my contract so I could be in the movie and he was very gracious to let me out of the last show of the season. He didn’t have to do that and I am very grateful he did."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.classicfilmtvcafe.com/2013/05/angela-cartwright-talks-with-cafe-about.html|title=Classic Film and TV Café|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Wonderful World of Burlesque===
In 1965 and 1966, Danny Thomas presented ''The Wonderful World of Burlesque'', featuring Lucille Ball, Jerry Lewis, Don Adams, Carol Channing, Andy Griffith, Sheldon Leonard, and Shirley Jones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zZW4AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT23&amp;lpg=PT23&amp;dq=Danny|title=This Was Burlesque|first1=Joseph|last1=DiMona|first2=Ann|last2=Corio|date=1 July 2014|publisher=Open Road Media|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2175332/|title=Danny Thomas Special: The Wonderful World of Burlesque|date=14 March 1965|publisher=|via=www.imdb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/481595/Wonderful-World-of-Burlesque-I-The/|title=Wonderful World of Burlesque I, The (1965) - Overview - TCM.com|website=Turner Classic Movies}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/shows/wonderful-world-burlesque-ii-danny-thomas-speci|title=Wonderful World of Burlesque II-Danny Thomas Speci|website=Television Academy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2368727/|title=Danny Thomas' The Wonderful World of Burlesque: Second Edition|date=8 December 1965|publisher=|via=www.imdb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4030458/|title=Danny Thomas' the Wonderful World of Burlesque: Third Edition|date=11 December 1966|publisher=|via=www.imdb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1991-01-06/entertainment/9101020319_1_danny-thomas-burlesque-show-business|title=A Nose For Show Biz|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XFnfnKg6BcAC&amp;pg=PA168&amp;lpg=PA168&amp;dq=Danny|title=Vaudeville old &amp; new: an encyclopedia of variety performances in America|first1=Frank|last1=Cullen|first2=Florence|last2=Hackman|first3=Donald|last3=McNeilly|date=21 January 2018|publisher=Psychology Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tcr6UMkvVPwC&amp;pg=PT424&amp;lpg=PT424&amp;dq=Danny|title=The Definitive Andy Griffith Show Reference: Episode-by-Episode, with Cast and Production Biographies and a Guide to Collectibles|first1=Dale|last1=Robinson|first2=David|last2=Fernandes|date=24 August 2012|publisher=McFarland|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/26/Danny-Thomas.html|title=Danny Thomas Biography (1912-1991)|website=www.filmreference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/07/obituaries/danny-thomas-79-the-tv-star-of-make-room-for-daddy-dies.html|title=Danny Thomas, 79, the TV Star Of 'Make Room for Daddy,' Dies|date=7 February 1991|website=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neco.org/medal-of-honor/medalists-database?medalist=30643|title=Medalists Database|website=www.neco.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.guideposts.org/faith-and-prayer/prayer-stories/power-of-prayer/guideposts-classics-danny-thomas-on-keeping-his|title=Guideposts Classics: Danny Thomas on Keeping His Promise|date=24 November 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wufilmarchive.wordpress.com/2013/10/03/harrywald/|title=Burlesque, St. Louis, and the Harry Wald Collection|date=3 October 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://memphismagazine.com/features/fifty-things/|title=Fifty Things You (Probably) Didn’t Know About St. Jude|date=1 January 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Danny Thomas Hour===
''[[The Danny Thomas Hour]]'' is an American [[Anthology series|anthology television series]] that was broadcast on [[NBC]] during the [[1967-68 United States network television schedule|1967-68 television season]].

===Producer===
Thomas became a successful television producer (with [[Sheldon Leonard]] and [[Aaron Spelling]] among his partners) of ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]'', ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'', ''[[That Girl]]'' and ''[[The Mod Squad]]''. Thomas also produced three series for [[Walter Brennan]]: ''[[The Real McCoys]]'', ''[[The Tycoon (TV series)|The Tycoon]]'', and ''[[The Guns of Will Sonnett]]'' on ABC during the late 1950s and 1960s. Thomas often appeared in cameos on shows he produced, including his portrayal of the tuxedoed, droll alien Kolak, from the planet Twilo, in the ''Dick Van Dyke Show'' science-fiction spoof, "It May Look Like a Walnut".
[[File:Thomas benny hope benny special 1968.JPG|thumb|Thomas, [[Jack Benny]], and [[Bob Hope]] in a March 1968 Jack Benny special]]

Thomas was responsible for [[Mary Tyler Moore]]'s first "big break" in acting. In 1961, Carl Reiner cast her in ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]'' after Thomas personally recommended Moore. He had remembered her as "the girl with three names" whom he had turned down earlier, but rediscovered her after a lengthy search through photos and records.

===Return to television===
In the early 1970s, Thomas reunited most of his second ''Daddy'' cast ([[Marjorie Lord]], [[Rusty Hamer]], and [[Angela Cartwright]]) for a short-lived update of the show, ''Make Room for Granddaddy''. Premised around Danny and Kathy Williams caring for their grandson by daughter Terry, who was away with her husband on a long business assignment, the show lasted one season.

By the mid-1970s, Thomas' son [[Tony Thomas (producer)|Tony]] had become an accomplished television producer. Tony, along with [[Paul Junger Witt]], formed [[Witt/Thomas Productions]] in 1975, and was responsible for his father's next three (and ultimately final) starring vehicles. Thomas returned to series TV in the NBC sitcom, ''[[The Practice (1976 TV series)|The Practice]]'', from January 1976 to January 1977, and after that ''[[I'm a Big Girl Now]]'', which aired on ABC from 1980 to 1981.

Thomas was guest of honor in ''[[The Dean Martin Celebrity Roast]]'' that aired December 15, 1976 on [[NBC]]. He guest-starred in "In Full Command," the March 18, 1978 series finale of the long-running detective drama ''[[List of Kojak episodes|Kojak]]'', as a corrupt superior officer in the police department, in an episode directed by series star [[Telly Savalas]]. He also appeared in the 1988 TV movie ''Side by Side'', opposite [[Milton Berle]] and [[Sid Caesar]].

The last series in which Thomas was a headlining star was ''[[One Big Family (TV series)|One Big Family]]'', which aired in [[television syndication|syndication]] during the 1986–1987 season. The situation comedy's premise was set around a semi-retired comedian whose grandchildren were orphaned after their parents were killed in a car accident.&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, Tim, and Earle Marsh, ''The Complete Directory to Prine Time Network and Cable TV Shows, 1946–Present,'' 20th Anniversary Edition, Ballantine Books, New York, 1999, p. 758-759.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commercials===
Thomas, like many actors prominent in television, endorsed commercial products. In particular, two companies that featured him in their advertising were [[Maxwell House]], whose instant coffee he endorsed (though it had no decaffeinated variant at the time, he later claimed he had been endorsing a "decaffeinated" instant coffee and the coffee he actually drank had a high caffeine content){{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}, and [[Philips]] [[Norelco]]'s "Dial-A-Brew" version of its short-lived "Better Cup Of Coffee" line of electric drip coffee-makers. One of his other "commercials" was actually a public-service message, with fund-raising goals, for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.

===St. Jude Children's Research Hospital===
As a "starving actor", Thomas had made a vow: If he found success, he would open a shrine dedicated to [[Jude the Apostle|St. Jude Thaddeus]], the patron saint of hopeless causes.
