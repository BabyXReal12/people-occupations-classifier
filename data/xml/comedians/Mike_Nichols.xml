'''Mike Nichols''' (born '''Mikhail Igor Peschkowsky'''; November 6, 1931 – November 19, 2014) was an American film and theater director, producer, actor, and comedian. He was noted for his ability to work across a range of genres and an aptitude for getting the best out of actors regardless of their acting experience. Nichols began his career in the 1950s with the comedy [[Improvisational theatre|improvisational]] troupe, [[Compass Players|The Compass Players]], predecessor of [[The Second City]], in [[Chicago]]. He then teamed up with his improv partner, [[Elaine May]], to form the comedy duo [[Nichols and May]]. Their live improv acts were a hit on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] resulting in three albums, with their debut album winning a [[Grammy Award]].

After Nichols and May disbanded their act in 1961, Nichols began directing plays. He soon earned a reputation as a skilled Broadway director with a flair for creating innovative productions and the ability to elicit polished performances from actors. His debut Broadway play was [[Neil Simon]]'s ''[[Barefoot in the Park]]'' in 1963, with [[Robert Redford]] and [[Elizabeth Ashley]]. He next directed ''[[Luv (play)|Luv]]'' in 1964 and in 1965 directed another Neil Simon play, ''[[The Odd Couple (play)|The Odd Couple]]''. Nichols received a [[Tony Award for Best Direction of a Play|Tony Award]] for each of those plays. Nearly five decades later, he won his sixth [[Tony Award for Best Direction of a Play]] with a revival of ''Death of a Salesman'' in 2012. During his career he directed or produced more than twenty-five Broadway plays.

In 1966, [[Warner Brothers]] invited Nichols to direct his first film, ''[[Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (film)|Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?]]'', starring [[Elizabeth Taylor]] and [[Richard Burton]]. The groundbreaking and acclaimed film led critics to declare Nichols the "new [[Orson Welles]]". The film garnered 13 [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations, winning five. It was also a box office hit and became the number 1 film of 1966. His next film was ''[[The Graduate]]'' in 1967, starring then unknown actor [[Dustin Hoffman]], alongside [[Anne Bancroft]] and [[Katharine Ross]]. The film was another critical and financial success, becoming the highest-grossing film of 1967 and receiving seven Academy Award nominations, winning Nichols the [[Academy Award for Best Director]]. Among the other films he directed were ''[[Catch-22 (film)|Catch-22]]'' (1970), ''[[Carnal Knowledge]]'' (1971), ''[[Silkwood]]'' (1983), ''[[Working Girl]]'' (1988), ''[[Wolf (1994 film)|Wolf]]'' (1994), ''[[The Birdcage]]'' (1996), ''[[Closer (2004 film)|Closer]]'' (2004), and ''[[Charlie Wilson's War (film)|Charlie Wilson's War]]'' (2007).

Along with an Academy Award, Nichols won a Grammy Award (the first for a comedian born outside the United States), four [[Emmy Awards]] and nine Tony Awards. He was also a three-time [[BAFTA Award]] winner. His other honors included the [[Film Society of Lincoln Center#Past honorees of Gala Tribute|Lincoln Center Gala Tribute]] in 1999, the [[National Medal of Arts]] in 2001,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Medal of Arts|url=http://arts.gov/honors/medals/mike-nichols|publisher=National Endowment for the Arts|accessdate=November 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Kennedy Center Honors]] in 2003 and the [[AFI Life Achievement Award]] in 2010. His films garnered a total of 42 Academy Award nominations and seven wins.

==Early life==
Nichols was born Mikhail Igor Peschkowsky&lt;ref name=facssf1&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gates Jr|first1=Henry Louis,|title=Faces of America: How 12 Extraordinary People Discovered Their Pasts|date=2010|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York|isbn=9780814732649|pages=14–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; on November 6, 1931, in [[Berlin]], [[Weimar Republic|Germany]], the son of Brigitte ([[Married and maiden names|née]] Landauer) and Pavel Peschkowsky, a physician.&lt;ref name=facssf1/&gt; His father was born in [[Vienna]], Austria, to a [[Russian Jews|Russian Jewish]] immigrant family. Nichols' father's family had been wealthy and lived in [[Siberia]], leaving after the [[Russian Revolution]], and settling in Germany around 1920.&lt;ref name=facssf1/&gt; Nichols' mother's family were [[German Jews]].&lt;ref name=facssf1/&gt; His maternal grandparents were [[Gustav Landauer]],&lt;ref name=Weber/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/mike-nichols-mike-nichols-biography-and-career-timeline/6155/|title=Mike Nichols - Timeline|author=American Masters|date=5 January 2016|website=pbs.org|accessdate=28 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; a leading theorist on [[anarchism]], and author [[Hedwig Lachmann]]. Nichols was a third cousin twice removed of scientist [[Albert Einstein]], through Nichols' mother.&lt;ref name=facssf1/&gt;

In April 1939, when the [[Nazism|Nazis]] were arresting Jews in Berlin, seven-year-old Mikhail and his three-year-old brother Robert were sent alone to the United States to join their father, who had fled months earlier. His mother eventually joined the family, escaping through Italy in 1940.&lt;ref name=PBS&gt;{{cite web|title=Faces of America: Mike Nichols|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/facesofamerica/profiles/mike-nichols/5/|publisher=Public Broadcasting Service|accessdate=November 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family moved to [[New York City]] on April 28, 1939.&lt;ref name=facssf1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/dec/16/entertainment/ca-nichols16 |title= Mike Nichols' life in the trenches |first= Glenn |last= Kenny |newspaper= [[Los Angeles Times]] |date= December 16, 2007|accessdate=November 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, whose original Russian name was Pavel Nikolaevich Peschkowsky, changed his name to Paul Nichols, Nichols derived from his Russian [[patronymic]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Before he established his practice, he was a union doctor, and part of his job was X-raying union members, they didn’t know about shielding X-ray machines.

Nichols' youth was difficult because by age 4, following an inoculation for whooping cough, he had lost his hair, and consequently wore wigs for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name=Weber&gt;{{cite news|last1=Weber|first1=Bruce|title=Mike Nichols, Urbane Director Loved by Crowds and Critics, Dies at 83|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/21/movies/mike-nichols-celebrated-director-dies-at-83.html?contentCollection=theater&amp;action=click&amp;module=NextInCollection&amp;region=Footer&amp;pgtype=article|accessdate=November 21, 2014|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=November 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became a [[naturalized]] citizen of the United States in 1944 and attended public elementary school in Manhattan ([[List of public elementary schools in New York City#Region 9: Manhattan, the Bronx|PS 87]]).&lt;ref&gt;Stated on an episode of ''[[Faces of America (PBS series)|Faces of America]]'', in 2010&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating from the [[Walden School (New York City)|Walden School]], a private progressive school on Central Park West, Nichols briefly attended [[New York University]] before dropping out. In 1950, he enrolled in the pre-med program at the [[University of Chicago]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1988"/&gt; He later described this college period as "paradise," recalling how "I never had a friend from the time I came to this country until I got to the [[University of Chicago]]."&lt;ref name=Weber /&gt;

While in Chicago in 1953, Nichols joined the staff of struggling classical music station [[WFMT]], 98.7 FM, as an announcer. Co-owner Rita Jacobs asked Nichols to create a folk music program on Saturday nights, which he named "The Midnight Special." He hosted the program for two years before leaving for New York City. Nichols frequently invited musicians to perform live in the studio and eventually created a unique blend of "folk music and farce, showtunes and satire, odds and ends," along with his successor Norm Pellegrini. The program endures today in the same time slot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cohen|first1=Ronald D.|title=Rainbow Quest: The Folk Music Revival and American Society, 1940-1970|date=2002|publisher=University of Massachusetts press|location=Amherst|isbn=9781558493483|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comedy career with "Nichols and May"==
[[File:Elaine May and Mike Nichols 1960.JPG|left|thumb|[[Nichols and May]], c. 1960]]

{{main|Nichols and May}}
Nichols first saw [[Elaine May]] when she was sitting in the front row while he was playing the lead in a Chicago production of ''[[Miss Julie]],'' and they made eye contact.&lt;ref name=Coleman/&gt;{{rp|39}} Weeks later he ran into her in a train station where he started a conversation in an assumed accent, pretending to be a spy, and she played along, using another accent.&lt;ref name=Nachman/&gt;{{rp|325}} They hit it off immediately, which led to a brief romance. Later in his career, he said "Elaine was very important to me from the moment I saw her."&lt;ref name=Nachman/&gt;{{rp|325}}

In 1953, Nichols left Chicago for New York City to study [[method acting]] under [[Lee Strasberg]], but was unable to find stage work there.&lt;!--LAT ref is for the entire paragraph--&gt;&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt; He was invited back to join Chicago's [[Compass Players]] in 1955, the predecessor to Chicago's [[The Second City|Second City]], whose members included May, [[Shelley Berman]], [[Del Close]], and Nancy Ponder,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1988"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Coleman&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coleman|first1=Janet|title=The Compass: The Improvisational Theatre That Revolutionized American Comedy|date=1991|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0226113450}}&lt;/ref&gt; directed by [[Paul Sills]].  In Chicago, he started doing improvisational routines with May, which eventually led to the formation of the [[comedy duo]] [[Nichols and May]] in 1958, first performing in New York City.

[[File:Nichols and May - 1961.jpg|thumb|Theater program from 1961]]
They performed live [[satire|satirical]] comedy acts and eventually released three records of their routines, which became best-sellers. They also appeared in nightclubs and were on radio and television. [[Jack Rollins (producer)|Jack Rollins]], who later became [[Woody Allen]]'s manager and producer, invited them to audition and was most impressed: "Their work was so startling, so new, as fresh as could be. I was stunned by how really good they were, actually as impressed by their acting technique as by their comedy. . . I thought, My God, these are two people writing hilarious comedy on their feet!&lt;ref name=Nachman&gt;{{cite book |last1= Nachman |first1=Gerald |author-link1= Gerald Nachman (journalist) |title=Seriously Funny |script-title=The Rebel Comedians of the 1950s and 1960s|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B_Yzl5uXacwC |location=New York, NY |publisher=Pantheon Books |publication-date=2003 |pages=659 |isbn=  9780375410307 &lt;!-- 0375410309 --&gt; |oclc=50339527  |trans-title= |author-mask1= |date= |year= |orig-year= |editor1-last= |editor1-first= |editor1-link= |editor1-mask= |display-editors= |format= |type= |language= |edition= |page= |dead-url= |archive-url= |archive-date= |access-date= |quote= |postscript= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|340}}

In 1960, Nichols and May opened the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] show ''An Evening With Mike Nichols and Elaine May'', directed by [[Arthur Penn]]. The LP album of the show won the 1962 [[Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album]]. Personal idiosyncrasies and tensions eventually drove the duo apart to pursue other projects in 1961. About their sudden breakup, director [[Arthur Penn]] said, "They set the standard and then they had to move on,"&lt;ref name=Nachman/&gt;{{rp|351}} while talk show host [[Dick Cavett]] said "they were one of the comic meteors in the sky."&lt;ref name=Nachman/&gt;{{rp|348}} Comedy historian [[Gerald Nachman (journalist)|Gerald Nachman]] describes the effect of their break-up on American comedy:

{{quote|Nichols and May are perhaps the most ardently missed of all the satirical comedians of their era. When Nichols and May split up, they left no imitators, no descendants, no blueprints or footprints to follow. No one could touch them.&lt;ref name=Nachman/&gt;{{rp|319}} }}

They later reconciled and worked together many times, such as on the unsuccessful ''A Matter of Position'', a play written by May and starring Nichols. They appeared together at President [[Jimmy Carter]]'s inaugural gala, in 1977, and in a 1980 New Haven stage revival of ''[[Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?]]'' with [[Swoosie Kurtz]] and [[James Naughton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=Lee |last=Hill | title=Great Directors Critical Database: Mike Nichols | url=http://www.sensesofcinema.com/2003/great-directors/nichols/ | work=Senses of Cinema| date=June 2003 | accessdate=October 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; May scripted Nichols' films ''[[The Birdcage]]'' (1996) and ''[[Primary Colors (film)|Primary Colors]]'' (1998). In 2010, at the [[AACTA Awards|AFI]]s "Life Achievement Award" ceremony, May gave a humor-filled tribute to Nichols.&lt;ref&gt;video clip: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgjBxiDmJyU "Elaine May Salutes Mike Nichols at the AFI Life Achievement Award"], American Film Institute&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career as a director==

===1960s===

====Pre-film stage career====
After the professional split with May, Nichols went to [[Vancouver, B.C.]] to work in the theater directing a production of [[Oscar Wilde]]'s ''[[The Importance of Being Earnest]]'' and acted in a revival of [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s ''[[Saint Joan (play)|St. Joan]]''.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1988"/&gt;

In 1963, Nichols was chosen to direct [[Neil Simon]]'s play ''[[Barefoot In The Park]]''.  He realized at once that he was meant to be a director, saying in a 2003 interview: "On the first day of rehearsal, I thought, 'Well, look at this. Here is what I was meant to do.' I knew instantly that I was home".&lt;ref name=latimes&gt;{{cite news|last1=McLellan|first1=Dennis|title=Mike Nichols, acclaimed director of 'The Graduate,' dies at 83|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-me-mike-nichols-dies-at-83-20141120-story.html#page=1|accessdate=November 20, 2014|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=November 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Barefoot in the Park'' was a big hit, running for 1530 performances and earning Nichols a [[18th Tony Awards|Tony Award]] for his direction.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1988"/&gt;

This began a series of highly successful plays on Broadway (often from works by Simon) that would establish his reputation. After an off-Broadway production of [[Ann Jellicoe]]'s ''[[The Knack ...and How to Get It|The Knack]]'', Nichols directed [[Murray Schisgal]]'s play ''[[Luv (play)|Luv]]'' in 1964. Again the show was a hit and Nichols won a [[19th Tony Awards|Tony Award]] (shared with ''The Odd Couple''). In 1965 he directed another play by [[Neil Simon]], ''[[The Odd Couple (play)|The Odd Couple]]''. The original production starred [[Art Carney]] as Felix Ungar and [[Walter Matthau]] as Oscar Madison. The play ran for 966 performances and won [[19th Tony Awards|Tony Awards]] for Nichols, Simon and Matthau.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1988"/&gt; Overall, Nichols won nine [[Tony Award]]s:&lt;ref name=suntimes&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thomas|first1=Mike|title=The best of Mike Nichols|url=http://www.suntimes.com/news/obituaries/31194296-418/the-best-of-mike-nichols.html#.VG91T4vF98E|accessdate=November 21, 2014|publisher=''Chicago Sun Times''|date=November 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;{{cite news|title=Mike Nichols - obituary|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/11243432/Mike-Nichols-obituary.html|accessdate=November 21, 2014|publisher=''The Telegraph''|date=November 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; including six for Best Director of either a play or a musical, one for Best Play, and one for Best Musical.

====''Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?''====
In 1966, Nichols was a star stage director and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine called him "the most in-demand director in the American theatre."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1988"/&gt; Although he had no experience in filmmaking, after befriending&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/09/remembering-director-mike-nichols|title=Mike Nichols’s Life and Career: The Definitive Oral History|first=Sam|last=Kashner|date=|website=vanityfair.com|accessdate=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elizabeth Taylor]] and [[Richard Burton]], [[Warner Bros.]] invited Nichols to direct a screen adaptation of [[Edward Albee]]'s ''[[Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?]]'' starring [[Elizabeth Taylor]], [[Richard Burton]], [[George Segal]], and [[Sandy Dennis]]. The film was critically acclaimed, with critics calling Nichols "the new Orson Welles",&lt;ref name="autogenerated1988"/&gt; and a financial success,&lt;ref&gt;"Big Rental Pictures of 1966", ''Variety'', January 4, 1967 p 8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Clooney71&gt;{{cite book |last1=Clooney |first1=Nick |authorlink1=Nick Clooney |title=The Movies That Changed Us: Reflections on the Screen|date=November 2002|publisher=Atria Books, a trademark of Simon &amp; Schuster |location=New York |isbn=0-7434-1043-2 |page=71|quote=''Nichols's golden touch was intact.

The film was considered groundbreaking for having a level of profanity and sexual innuendo unheard of at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Jack Valenti| title=How It All Began | url=http://www.mpaa.org/Ratings_HowItAllBegan.asp | publisher=Motion Picture Association of America | date= | accessdate=June 17, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080521023225/http://www.mpaa.org/Ratings_HowItAllBegan.asp &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = May 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Virginia Woolf' Not For Kids|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=4PhRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=SHQDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6178,4267811&amp;dq=who%27s+afraid+of+virginia+woolf&amp;hl=en|accessdate=February 20, 2013|newspaper=[[St. Petersburg Times]]|date=May 27, 1966}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clooney, p. 82-84, 90&lt;/ref&gt; It won five [[39th Academy Awards|Academy Awards]] and garnered thirteen nominations (including Nichols' first nomination for Best Director), earning the distinctions of being one of only two films nominated in every eligible category at the Oscars (the other being ''[[Cimarron (1931 film)|Cimarron]]''), and the first film to have its entire credited cast nominated for acting Oscars. It also won three [[20th British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA Awards]] and was later ranked #67 in ''[[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)]]''.

====''The Graduate''====
His next film was ''[[The Graduate]]'' (1967), starring [[Dustin Hoffman]], [[Anne Bancroft]] and [[Katharine Ross]]. It became the highest-grossing film of 1967 and one of the biggest grossing films in history up to that date.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=graduate.htm ''The Graduate''], Box Office Mojo&lt;/ref&gt; It was nominated for seven [[40th Academy Awards|Academy Awards]], including Best Picture, with Nichols winning as [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]]. In 2007, it was ranked #17 in ''[[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)]]''.

However, getting the film made was difficult for Nichols, who, while noted for being a successful Broadway director, was still an unknown in Hollywood. Producer [[Lawrence Turman]], who wanted only Nichols to direct it, was continually turned down for financing. He then contacted producer [[Joseph E. Levine]], who said he would finance the film because he knew of Nichols' reputation as a Broadway director, and because he heard that Elizabeth Taylor specifically wanted Nichols to direct her and Richard Burton in ''Virginia Woolf''.&lt;ref name=Kashner/&gt; With financing assured, Nichols suggested [[Buck Henry]] for screenwriter, although Henry's experience had also been mostly in improvised comedy, and had no writing background. Nichols said to Henry, "I think you could do it; I think you ''should'' do it."&lt;ref name=Kashner/&gt;

Nichols also took a chance on using [[Dustin Hoffman]], who had no film experience, for the lead, when others had suggested using known star [[Robert Redford]]. Hoffman credits Nichols for having taken a great risk in giving him, a relative unknown, the starring role: "I don't know of another instance of a director at the height of his powers who would take a chance and cast someone like me in that part. It took tremendous courage."&lt;ref name=Kashner&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kashner|first1=Sam|title=Here's to You, Mr. Nichols: The Making of The Graduate|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2008/03/graduate200803|publisher=Vanity Fair|accessdate=November 21, 2014|date=March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The quality of the [[cinematography]] was also influenced by Nichols, who chose Oscar winner [[Robert L. Surtees|Robert Surtees]] to do the photography. Surtees, who had photographed major films since the 1920s, including ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'', said later, "It took everything I had learned over 30 years to be able to do the job. I knew that Mike Nichols was a young director who went in for a lot of camera. We did more things in this picture than I ever did in one film."&lt;ref name=Kashner/&gt;

Nichols also chose the music by [[Simon and Garfunkel]]. When Paul Simon was taking too long to write new songs for the film, he used existing songs, originally planning to replace them with newly written ones. In the end only one new song was available, and Nichols used the existing previously released songs. At one point, when Nichols heard [[Paul Simon]]'s song, "Mrs. Roosevelt," he suggested to Simon that he change it to "[[Mrs. Robinson]]." The song won a Grammy after the film was released and became America's number 1 pop song. Nichols selected all the numerous songs for the film and chose which scenes they would be used in. The placement and selection of songs would affect the way audiences understood the film. Even actor [[William Daniels]], who played Hoffman's father, remembers that after first hearing the songs, especially "[[The Sound of Silence]]," he thought, "Oh, wait a minute. That changed the whole idea of the picture for me," suddenly realizing the film would not be a typical comedy.&lt;ref name=Kashner/&gt;

Nichols had previously returned to Broadway to direct ''[[The Apple Tree]]'', starring [[the Second City|Second City]] alumna, [[Barbara Harris (actress)|Barbara Harris]]. After doing ''The Graduate'', he again returned to the Broadway stage with a revival of [[Lillian Hellman]]'s ''[[The Little Foxes]]'' in 1967, which ran for 100 performances.&lt;ref name=vault2&gt;{{cite web| title=The Little Foxes| url=http://www.playbillvault.com/Show/Detail/4355/The-Little-Foxes| publisher=Playbill Vault| accessdate=April 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then directed Neil Simon's ''[[Plaza Suite]]'' in 1968, earning him another [[22nd Tony Awards|Tony Award]] for Best Director. He also directed the short film ''[[Teach Me!]]'' (1968), which starred actress [[Sandy Dennis]].

===1970s===
Nichols' next film was a big-budget adaptation of [[Joseph Heller]]'s novel ''[[Catch-22]]'' (1970), followed by ''[[Carnal Knowledge]]'' (1971) starring [[Jack Nicholson]], [[Ann-Margret]], [[Art Garfunkel]] and [[Candice Bergen]]. The latter film was highly controversial upon release because of the casual and blunt depiction of sexual intercourse.&lt;ref name=library&gt;{{cite web|title=Censored Films and Television II|url=http://explore.lib.virginia.edu/exhibits/show/censored/walkthrough/film2|publisher=University of Virginia Library|accessdate=November 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], a theatre manager was convicted in 1972 of violating the state's obscenity statutes by showing the film, a conviction later overturned by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] in ''[[Jenkins v. Georgia]]''.&lt;ref name=justia&gt;{{cite web|title=Jenkins v.

Nichols returned to Broadway to direct [[Neil Simon]]'s ''[[The Prisoner of Second Avenue]]'' in 1971. The play won Nichols another [[26th Tony Awards|Tony Award]] for Best Director. In 1973, Nichols directed a revival of [[Anton Chekhov]]'s ''[[Uncle Vanya]]'' on Broadway starring [[George C. Scott]] and with a new translation by himself and Albert Todd.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1988"/&gt; In 1973 Nichols directed the film ''[[The Day of the Dolphin]]'' starring [[George C. Scott]], based on the French novel ''[[The Day of the Dolphin (book)|Un animal doué de raison]]'' (lit. ''A Sentient Animal'') by [[Robert Merle]] and adapted by [[Buck Henry]]. The film was not successful financially and received mixed reviews from critics.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1988"/&gt; Nichols next directed ''[[The Fortune]]'' (1975), starring [[Warren Beatty]], [[Jack Nicholson]] and [[Stockard Channing]]. Again, the film was a financial failure and received mostly negative reviews. It was Nichols' last feature narrative film for eight years.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1988"/&gt;

Nichols returned to the stage with two moderately successful productions in 1976; [[David Rabe]]'s ''[[Streamers (play)|Streamers]]'' opened in April and ran for 478 performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Streamers|url=http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=13520|publisher=The Broadway League|accessdate=November 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Trevor Griffiths]]'s ''[[Comedians (play)|Comedians]]'' ran for 145 performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Comedians|url=http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=3875|publisher=The Broadway League|accessdate=November 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976 Nichols also worked as Executive Producer to create the television drama ''[[Family (1976 TV series)|Family]]'' for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. The series ran until 1980.

In 1977, Nichols produced the original Broadway production of the hugely successful musical ''[[Annie (musical)|Annie]]'', which ran for 2,377 performances until 1983. Nichols won the Tony Award for Best Musical.&lt;ref name="Morrison"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morrison|first1=William|title=Broadway Theatres: History and Architecture|date=1999|publisher=Dover Publications|location=Mineola, N.Y.|isbn=9780486402444|pages=154–155}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 1977, Nichols directed  D.L. Coburn's ''[[The Gin Game]]''. The play ran for 517 performances and won a Tony Award for Best Actress for [[Jessica Tandy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Gin Game|url=http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=4017|publisher=The Broadway League|accessdate=November 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s===
In 1980, Nichols directed the documentary ''[[Gilda Live]]'', a filmed performance of comedian [[Gilda Radner]]'s one-woman show ''Gilda Radner Live on Broadway''. It was released at the same time as the album of the show, both of which were successful. Nichols then directed two unsuccessful shows: ''[[Billy Bishop Goes to War]]'', which opened in 1980 and closed after only twelve performances,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=3957  Billy Bishop Goes to War]. The Broadway League. Retrieved March 12, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Neil Simon]]'s ''[[Fools (play)|Fools]]'', in 1981, which closed after forty performances.&lt;ref name=rich&gt;Rich, Frank (April 7, 1981).

Returning to Hollywood, Nichols' career rebounded in 1983 with the film ''[[Silkwood]]'', starring [[Meryl Streep]], [[Cher]] and [[Kurt Russell]], based on the life of whistleblower [[Karen Silkwood]]. The film was a financial and critical success, with film critic [[Vincent Canby]] calling it "the most serious work Mike Nichols has yet done."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1988"/&gt; The film received five [[Academy Award]] nominations, including a Best Director nomination for Nichols.

That same year, Nichols and [[Peter Stone]] helped to fix up and rewrite the musical ''[[My One and Only (musical)|My One and Only]]'' just days before its Boston premiere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shewey|first1=Don|title=How 'My One and Only' came to Broadway|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/01/theater/how-my-one-and-only-came-to-broadway.html|work=The New York Times|accessdate=November 21, 2014|date=May 1, 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show eventually went to Broadway and ran for 767 performances, winning [[Tony Awards]] for Best Actor, Best Choreography (both for [[Tommy Tune]]) and best Supporting Actor ([[Charles Coles|Charles "Honi" Coles]]).

In 1984, Nichols directed the Broadway premiere of [[Tom Stoppard]]'s ''[[The Real Thing (play)|The Real Thing]]''. ''[[The New York Times]]'' critic [[Frank Rich]] wrote that "The Broadway version of ''The Real Thing'' - a substantial revision of the original London production - is not only Mr. Stoppard's most moving play, but also the most bracing play that anyone has written about love and marriage in years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://theater.nytimes.com/mem/theater/treview.html?res=9407E7D81338F935A35752C0A962948260|title=Tom Stoppard's ''Real Thing''|last=Rich|first=Frank|date=January 6, 1984|work=The New York Times|accessdate=March 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The play was nominated for seven [[38th Tony Awards|Tony Awards]] and won five, including a Best Director Tony for Nichols.

Nichols followed the success with the Broadway premiere of [[David Rabe]]'s ''[[Hurlyburly]]'', also in 1984. It was performed just two blocks away from the theater showing ''The Real Thing''. It was nominated for three [[39th Tony Awards|Tony Awards]] and won Best Actress for [[Judith Ivey]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1988"/&gt;

In 1983, Nichols had seen comedian [[Whoopi Goldberg]]'s one woman show, ''The Spook Show'' and wanted to help her expand it. Goldberg's self-titled Broadway show opened in October 1984 and ran for 156 performances. [[Rosie O'Donnell]] said that Nichols had discovered Goldberg while she was struggling as a downtown street artist: "He gave her the entire beginning of her career and recognized her brilliance before anyone else."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rivera|first1=Zayda|title=Mike Nichols dead at 83: Whoopi Goldberg breaks down on 'The View' when talking about her 'mentor'|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/whoopi-goldberg-breaks-talking-mike-nichols-article-1.2017875|publisher=New York Daily News|accessdate=November 21, 2014|date=November 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986 Nichols directed the Broadway premiere of [[Andrew Bergman]]'s ''[[Social Security (play)|Social Security]]'' and in 1988 directed ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'', starring [[Robin Williams]] and [[Steve Martin]].&lt;ref&gt;Kornbluth, Jesse. "Robin Williams's Change of Life", ''New York Magazine'', November 22, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; Williams cited Nichols and May as among his early influences for performing intelligent comedy.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert, Emily. ''Robin Williams: When the Laughter Stops 1951–2014'', John Blak Publishing (2014) e-bk&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, Nichols directed the film ''[[Heartburn (film)|Heartburn]]'', which received mixed reviews, and starred Meryl Streep and [[Jack Nicholson]]. In 1988, Nichols completed two feature films. The first was an adaptation of [[Neil Simon]]'s autobiographical stage play ''[[Biloxi Blues (film)|Biloxi Blues]]'' starring [[Matthew Broderick]], also receiving mixed critical reviews. Nichols directed one of his most successful films, ''[[Working Girl]]'', which starred [[Melanie Griffith]], [[Harrison Ford]] and [[Sigourney Weaver]]. The film was a huge hit upon its release. It also received mostly positive reviews from critics with an 84% rating at [[Rotten Tomatoes]] and a 73 metascore at [[Metacritic]]. It was nominated for six [[61st Academy Awards|Academy Awards]] (including Best Director for Nichols) and won the [[Academy Award for Best Song]] for [[Carly Simon]]'s "[[Let the River Run]]".

At one point in the 1980s, Nichols—who was prone to bouts of depression—reported that he had considered suicide, a feeling apparently brought on by a psychotic episode he experienced after taking the drug [[Halcion]].&lt;ref name=Weber /&gt;

===1990s===
In the 1990s, Nichols directed several more successful, well-received films including ''[[Postcards from the Edge (film)|Postcards from the Edge]]'' (1990) starring Meryl Streep and [[Shirley MacLaine]]; ''[[Primary Colors (film)|Primary Colors]]'' (1998) starring [[John Travolta]] and [[Emma Thompson]]; and ''[[The Birdcage]]'' (1996), an American remake of the 1978 French film ''[[La Cage aux Folles (film)|La Cage aux Folles]]'' starring [[Robin Williams]], [[Nathan Lane]], [[Gene Hackman]] and [[Dianne Wiest]]. Both ''The Birdcage'' and ''Primary Colors'' were written by Elaine May, Nichols' comedy partner earlier in his career. Other films directed by Nichols include ''[[Regarding Henry]]'' (1991) starring [[Harrison Ford]] and ''[[Wolf (1994 film)|Wolf]]'' (1994) starring [[Jack Nicholson]] and [[Michelle Pfeiffer]]. When he was honored by Lincoln Center in 1999 for his life's work, Elaine May—speaking once again as his friend—served up the essence of Nichols with the following:

&lt;blockquote&gt;So he's witty, he's brilliant, he's articulate, he's on time, he's prepared and he writes. But is he perfect? He knows you can't really be liked or loved if you're perfect. You have to have just enough flaws. And he does. Just the right, perfect flaws to be absolutely endearing.&lt;ref name="Weber Obit"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Weber|first1=Bruce|title=Mike Nichols, 83, Acclaimed Director on Broadway and in Hollywood, Dies|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/21/movies/mike-nichols-celebrated-director-dies-at-83.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;module=second-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news|accessdate=November 20, 2014|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=November 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===2010s===
In 2012, Nichols won the Best Direction of a Play [[Tony Award|Tony]] Award for [[Arthur Miller]]'s ''[[Death of a Salesman]]''. In April 2013, it was announced that he would direct [[Daniel Craig]] and [[Rachel Weisz]] in a Broadway revival of [[Harold Pinter]]'s ''[[Betrayal (play)|Betrayal]]''. The play began its limited run on October 1 at the [[Ethel Barrymore Theatre]], opening on November 3 through January 5, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fung|first=Lisa|title=Daniel Craig, Rachel Weisz heading to Broadway in 'Betrayal'|url=http://movies.msn.com/movies/article.aspx?news=800462&amp;ocid=rr-mov-news|work=[[The Wrap]]|publisher=[[MSN News]]|accessdate=April 5, 2013|date=April 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nichols was also in talks to direct a film adaptation of [[Jonathan Tropper]]'s novel ''One Last Thing Before I Go''. The film was to be produced by [[J.J.

Nichols was a contributing blogger at ''[[The Huffington Post]]''.  He was also a co-founder of [[The New Actors Workshop]] in [[New York City]], where he occasionally taught.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= | title=The Founders | url=http://www.newactorsworkshop.com | publisher=The New Actors Workshop | year=2009 | accessdate=February 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he remained active in the [[Directors Guild of America]], interviewing fellow film director [[Bennett Miller]] on stage in October 2011 after the Guild's screening of Miller's ''[[Moneyball (film)|Moneyball]]''.

In January 2016, [[PBS]] aired ''[[Mike Nichols: American Masters]]'',  an ''[[American Masters]]'' documentary about Nichols directed by his former improv partner, [[Elaine May]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/02/arts/television/elaine-may-to-direct-mike-nichols-documentary-for-pbs.html?_r=0 "Elaine May to Direct Mike Nichols Documentary for PBS"], ''New York Times'', November 1, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Interview: [https://www.npr.org/2016/01/29/464781450/revisiting-the-craft-and-vision-graduate-director-mike-nichols "Revisiting The Craft And Vision 'Graduate' Director Mike Nichols"], ''NPR'', January 29, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/reviews/american-masters-mike-nichols-review-pbs-elaine-may-1201681395/ |last=Lowry |first=Brian |title=TV Review: 'American Masters: Mike Nichols' |work=Variety |date=January 26, 2016 |accessdate=January 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 22, 2016, HBO aired the documentary ''Becoming Mike Nichols''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/cynthia-dagnalmyron/becoming-mike-nichols-an-_b_9195744.html "Becoming Mike Nichols, an HBO Master Class in Theater, Film and TV"], ''Huffington Post'', February 11, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Directing style==
After his early successes as a stage and film director, Nichols had developed a reputation as an [[auteur]] who likes to work intimately with his actors and writers, often using them repeatedly in different films. Writer [[Peter Applebome]] noted that "few directors have such a gift for getting performances out of actors."&lt;ref name=Whitehead&gt;{{cite book|last1=Whitehead|first1=J.W.|title=Mike Nichols and the Cinema of Transformation|date=2014|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company|isbn=9780786471454|pages=5, 90}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a half-year period in 1967 he had four hit plays running simultaneously on Broadway, during which time his first Hollywood feature, [[Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (film)|''Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'']], had also become a popular and critical success. Combined with his second film, ''The Graduate'', in 1967, the two films had already earned a total of 20 Oscar nominations, including two for Best Director, and winning it for ''The Graduate.''

Nichols was able to get the best out of actors regardless of their acting experience, whether an unknown such as Dustin Hoffman or a major star like Richard Burton. For his first film, [[Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (film)|''Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'']], each of the four actors was nominated for an [[Academy Award|Oscar]], with [[Elizabeth Taylor]] and [[Sandy Dennis]] winning. Burton later said, "I didn't think I could learn anything about comedy - I'd done all of Shakespeare's. But from him I learned," adding, "He conspires with you to get your best."&lt;ref name="Weber Obit"/&gt;

However, it was Taylor who chose Nichols to be their director, because, writes biographer [[David Bret]], "she particularly admired him because he had done a number of ad-hoc jobs to pay for his education after arriving in America as a seven-year-old Jewish refugee."&lt;ref name=bret&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bret|first1=David|title=Elizabeth Taylor : the lady, the lover, the legend : 1932-2011 : a new biography|date=2011|publisher=Greystone Books|location=Vancouver|isbn=1553654404|page=176}}&lt;/ref&gt; Producer [[Ernest Lehman]] agreed with her choice: "He was the only one who could handle them," he said. "The Burtons were quite intimidating, and we needed a genius like Mike Nichols to combat them."&lt;ref name=Kelley&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kelley|first1=Kitty|title=Elizabeth Taylor : the last star|date=2011|publisher=Simon and Schuster|location=New York|isbn=1451656769|page=222}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biographer [[Kitty Kelley]] says that neither Taylor nor Burton would ever again reach the heights of acting performance they did in that film.&lt;ref name=Kelley/&gt;

The same style of directing was used for ''The Graduate'', where, notes film historian [[Peter Biskind]], Nichols took Dustin Hoffman, with no movie acting experience, along with Anne Bancroft, Katharine Ross and others, and managed to get some of their finest acting on screen. This ability to work closely with actors would remain consistent throughout his career. Hoffman credits Nichols for permitting the realistic acting needed for the satirical roles in that film:

{{quote|It's Nichols's style&amp;mdash;he walks that edge of really going as far as he can without falling over the cliff, into disbelief. It's not caricature. That's the highest compliment for satire.&lt;ref name=Whitehead/&gt;}}

In a similar way, [[Jeremy Irons]], who acted in the play [[The Real Thing (play)|''The Real Thing'']], said that Nichols creates a very "protective environment: he makes you feel he's only there for you,"&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt; while [[Ann-Margret]], for her role in ''[[Carnal Knowledge]]'', felt the same: "What's wonderful about Mike is that he makes you feel like you're the one that's come up with the idea, when it's actually his."&lt;ref name=crane&gt;{{cite book|last1=Crane|first1=Robert|last2=Fryer|first2=Christopher|title=Jack Nicholson : the early years|date=2012|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|location=Lexington|isbn=0813136156|page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Nichols was married four times. The first three ended in divorce; the last ended upon his death.&lt;ref name=TDT&gt;{{cite web|title=Mike Nichols - obituary|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=November 20, 2014|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/11243432/Mike-Nichols-obituary.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also had a discreet decade-long affair with photographer [[Richard Avedon]], according to Avedon's studio director and business manager.&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, Norma and Aronson, Steven - ''Avedon: Something Personal''. {{ISBN|0812994434}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/12/books/review-richard-avedon-something-personal.html | work=The New York Times | title=Turning the Lens Around on Richard Avedon | date=December 12, 2017 | accessdate=December 14, 2017 | author=Parul Sehgal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nichol's first marriage was to Patricia Scot; they were married from 1957 to 1960.

He said he was connected to his Jewish heritage, but did not practice Judaism or any other religion. His three children, he told her, were not raised in any faith.

Nichols told Pogrebin that his daughter, Jenny, once said to him, "In the end you pick Jewish because it is harder.''"&lt;/ref&gt; His son Max married [[ESPN]] journalist [[Rachel Nichols (journalist)|Rachel Nichols]].

Among Nichols' personal pursuits was a lifelong interest in [[Arabian horse]]s. From 1968 to 2004, he owned a farm in Connecticut and was a noted [[horse breeder]]. Over the years, he also imported quality Arabian horses [[Janów Podlaski|from Poland]], some of which later resold for record-setting prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cochran|first1=Marsha|title=They Sell Horses, Don't They?
