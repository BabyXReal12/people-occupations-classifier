'''David L. Cook''' (born November 11, 1968) is an American [[Christian country music]] [[singer]], [[songwriter]] and [[comedian]].

Born to Donnell and June (née Mercer) Cook, David is the oldest of six children. He has written more than 2,500 songs and has won multiple [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] and Telly Awards.&lt;ref name="29th Annual TELLY Awards|Winners"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tellyawards.com/winners/list/entries/?l=D&amp;event=&amp;category=2&amp;award=2|title=The 29th Annual TELLY Awards|author=The Telly Awards Official Winners|publisher=Telly Academy|quote=Cook wins multiple Telly Awards|accessdate=June 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; His song, "Drop that Rock", was featured on his album ''In the Middle of It All'' and garnered a [[GMA Dove Award|Dove Award]] nomination for Christian Country Album of the Year in 1999.&lt;ref name="Cook's reference to writing over 2500 titles"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cook|first1=David L|title=Cook's reference to writing over 2500 titles|url=http://www.davidlcook.com/content/music/|website=www.davidlcook.com|publisher=Cook Enterprises|accessdate=December 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WOW Lyrics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wowlyrics.com/artist1.php?aid=28716|title=WOW Lyrics|accessdate=February 8, 2008|publisher=Wow Lyrics}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cook Receives Dove Award Nomination for Christian Country Album of the Year"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cook|first1=David L|title=Cook Receives Dove Award Nomination for Christian Country Album of the Year|url=http://www.crosswalk.com/culture/music/dove-award-nominees-540154.html|publisher=Crosswalk|accessdate=October 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cook Receives Dove Nomination"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Award|first1=Dove|title=Cook Receives Dove Nomination|url=http://www.tollbooth.org/new/news/99list.html|publisher=TollBooth|accessdate=October 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In all of Cook's overseas recordings his surname is '''Cooke''' to distinguish it from his work in the United States. The male members of [[The Cook Family Singers]] have always used just their middle initials as a trademark, a trait beginning back in 1885 when the first such group was formed.&lt;ref name="Come Follow Me"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cdbaby.com/cd/davidlcook1|title=CD Baby: DAVID L. COOK: Come Follow Me|accessdate=February 8, 2008|publisher=CD Baby}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990 Cook was diagnosed with a [[dissociative disorder]] and [[psychogenic amnesia]] reportedly brought on by an abusive father. In 1999 Cook's story was used as a lead story with [[The 700 Club]].&lt;ref name="Official bio"/&gt;

==Biography==
Cook was born in [[Pascagoula, Mississippi]]; after two years, his family moved to [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]]. Cook began his musical career at age five, singing with his family's group, [[The Cook Family Singers]]. After his parents' divorce, the group continued without Donnell, but in 1980, the group disbanded because of June's health issues.&lt;ref name="David L. Cook MP3 Downloads"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mp3.com/artist/david-l-cook/summary|title=David L. Cook MP3 Downloads|accessdate=February 1, 2008|publisher=mp3.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continued singing both gospel and secular music.

==Early life==
Early in life, Cook was abused by his father, who had a severe drinking problem. While intoxicated, Cook's father reportedly became violent towards his family. After many years of this abuse Cook developed many psychological problems that ended up following him through to his life as an adult. He developed a severe [[dissociative disorder]] and [[psychogenic amnesia]]. He recalled having periods of "missing time" but never really understood the cause. In 1990, doctors finally diagnosed the disorders after Cook experienced what they thought was a severe stroke and was rushed to the Coral Springs Medical Hospital in Fort. Lauderdale.&lt;ref name="Broward Health"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.browardhealth.org/body.cfm?id=64|title=Broward Health|accessdate=February 1, 2008|publisher=Coral Springs Medical Hospital|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070404001013/http://www.browardhealth.org/body.cfm?id=64 |archivedate=April 4, 2007 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He checked himself out of the hospital and disappeared from his Florida home and was found five months later in a [[Charlotte, North Carolina]], hospital with similar health complaints. Cook had been around Charlotte for five months and no one realized there was anything wrong until he started developing stroke symptoms again. Doctors diagnosed his problems, which were not organic, and referred him to see the proper specialists. He claims to have had no recollection of leaving Florida, nor what he had done during his five months in Charlotte. When asked, he stated that, "It was like someone switching off a light and then switching it back on."&lt;ref name="Official bio"&gt;[http://www.davidlcook.com David L. Cook official website]; accessed April 5, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Cook's story has been told through different media. [[The 700 Club]] did a full-length documentary about his life, which aired worldwide.&lt;ref name="Official bio"/&gt; Cook wrote a religious self-help book, ''Inspirational Words'' about the issues he overcame.&lt;ref name="amazon.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/1414049544|website=www.amazon.com|accessdate=November 19, 2010|title=''Inspirational Words''|date=February 17, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health==
On November 11, 2009, Cook was diagnosed with a [[parathyroid]] [[tumor]] in his neck. Doctors assessed that the tumor was pressing against his vocal cords making it virtually impossible for him to perform. He was treated at [[Vanderbilt University Medical Center]].&lt;ref name="Official bio"/&gt;

==Music==
{{See also|David L. Cook discography}}
Cook's first solo Christian album, ''Come Follow Me'', was released in 1985. The album was written and produced by singer/producer Frank X. Loconto, a former member of the group Lane Brothers. In 1986, he signed with the American Musical Academy of Arts Association (AMAAA), and released another album, ''Personal Feelings''.&lt;ref name="titleFrank Locontos Singing Rosary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.singingrosary.com/aboutus.html|title=Frank Loconto's Singing Rosary|accessdate=February 1, 2008|publisher=Frank X. Loconto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, Mountainview Records released Cook's album, ''In the Middle of it All'', which earned him a [[Gospel Music Association]] Dove Award nomination for Christian Country Album of the Year in 1999.&lt;ref name="Dove Nominees - The Phantom Tollbooth"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tollbooth.org/new/news/99list.html|title=The Dove Nominees – The Phantom Tollbooth|accessdate=February 1, 2008|publisher=GMA}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after a fallout with Mountainview records in 1999, he started his own record label, '''DLC Records'''. During this period Cook created a comedy character, named Mortermer Crabbottom, in the tradition of comedic Southern characters like [[Gomer Pyle]].&lt;ref name="Gomer Pyle"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jumptheshark.liveworld.com/topic/Gomer-Pyle-Usmc/Gomer-Pyle-Usmc-General-Comments/790&amp;start=30 |title=Gomer Pyle, USMC in Jump The Shark |accessdate=February 10, 2008 |publisher=Jump the Shark |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031021810/http://jumptheshark.liveworld.com/topic/Gomer-Pyle-Usmc/Gomer-Pyle-Usmc-General-Comments/790%26start%3D30 |archivedate=October 31, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cook recorded an album in character, ''Split Personality'', based on the life and times of Mortermer Crabbottom growing up in fictional Crabbottom USA.&lt;ref name="Split Personality"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cdbaby.com/cd/davidlcook3|title=Split Personality|accessdate=February 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, the Country Gospel Music Association inducted Cook into its Hall of Fame, along with [[Loretta Lynn]], [[Barbara Mandrell]], [[Andy Griffith]], [[Jody Miller]] and [[Lulu Roman]].&lt;ref name="Platinum Heart Awards"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrygospelmusic.com/platinumheart.htm|title=Platinum Heart Awards|accessdate=February 1, 2008|publisher=CGMA|work=Country Gospel Music Association website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 Cook co-wrote "Hands of Hope" with [[David Meece]] and [[Bruce Carroll]]. The song was fashioned along the same lines as "We Are the World", which featured many famous voices from the music industry. The song went number one on the charts and remained there for two weeks.&lt;ref name="Hands of Hope"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cook|first=David|title=Hands of Hope Charts|url=http://sogospel.com/2012/04/06/radioactive-airplay-com-releases-exclusive-radio-single-hands-of-hope|work=Charles Brady|publisher=Radio Active Airplay|accessdate=April 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song was used as the theme song for Turning Point Centers for Domestic Violence.&lt;ref name="Hands of Hope"/&gt; On May 5, 2012 [[NATAS]] announced that the song Hands of Hope garnered Cook, Meece and Carroll the Emmy® nomination for best Arrangement/Composer of a television theme song.&lt;ref name="NATAS"/&gt;

==Television==
In August 2007, Cook joined in partnership with the Firebird Arts Alliance. He was asked by [[David Tang]], the president of Firebird, to write and produce a theme song for the television series ''New South Crossings''.&lt;ref name="Firebird Arts Alliance"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firebirdartsalliance.org/majorprojects.php?cat=145|title=Firebird Arts Alliance: New South Crossings|accessdate=February 1, 2008|publisher=Firebird Arts Alliance}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theme song was "Meet Me at the Crossroads". Cook won an [[Emmy Award]]® on January 24, 2009 for his work on the series audio and soundtrack.&lt;ref name="NATAS"/&gt;

Cook appeared in an episode, "Master Class", in which Cook worked with younger artists.&lt;ref name="Firebird Arts Alliance"/&gt; He shows them the ins and outs of working together musically, and during the episode they perform the actual theme song for the series. On June 27, 2010, Cook won another Emmy® award, this time for writing and singing the theme song, ''Meet Me At the Crossroads''&lt;ref name="NATAS"/&gt;

In August 2013, Cook began working on his new television series, ''Written N Black &amp; White''. He is listed as one of the stars of the show along with fellow comedian, [[Trina Jeffrie]]. The two play an interracial newlywed couple who are comedians and their parents are clueless of the marriage. Although the series is said to take place in New York, the actual taping is done in [[Fort Mill, South Carolina]] at the former [[The PTL Club|PTL Studios]], which had housed the Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker PTL network back in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Written N Black &amp; White"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cook|first=David L|title=David Cook works on new television sitcom|url=http://thebroadcastgroup.com/event-center/complex|publisher=The Broadcast Group|accessdate=August 23, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921060900/http://thebroadcastgroup.com/event-center/complex/|archivedate=September 21, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IMDb"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hill|first=Dale|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2352272|title=IMDb profile|publisher=Artists Music Guild|accessdate=August 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nowels"&gt;{{cite web|last=Nowels|first=Chris|title=Nowels directs Written N Black &amp; White|url=http://www.ihnpro.com/Contact.html|publisher=[[Artists Music Guild]]|accessdate=August 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2006, the International Country Gospel Music Association inducted Cook and fellow artists, [[Mike Manuel]], [[Gayla Earlene]], Doug DeRamus and [[Marijohn Wilkin]] into the Hall of Fame.&lt;ref name="ICGMA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icgma.org|title=International Country Gospel Music Association (ICGMA) website|accessdate=February 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2009, Cook won his 5th [[Emmy Award]] for his work on the series, ''New South Crossings'' and he took home his sixth Emmy for the composing and arranging of "Meet Me At The Crossroads" in June 2010.&lt;ref name="NATAS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nashville.emmyonline.org/#121|title=NATAS|accessdate=June 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sogospel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sogospel.com/david-l-cook-wins-6th-emmy.htm|title=David L Cook Wins 6th Emmy for "Meet Me At The Crossroads"|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100817131858/http://sogospel.com/david-l-cook-wins-6th-emmy.htm|archivedate=August 17, 2010|accessdate=August 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cook was nominated on May 6, 2011 for three Emmy® Awards for the documentary, ''The Award Goes To: A Look Back at the Legends'', and at the June 18 telecast, he won his 7th Emmy® for Outstanding Excellence in a Live Event&lt;ref name="NATAS"/&gt;

In 2015 Cook hosted the Mississippi Music Awards and was given the prestigious Mississippi Marvel Award for all of his work with new artists coming up in the business.&lt;ref name="Cook Receives Mississippi Marvel Award"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cook|first1=David L|title=Cook Receives Mississippi Marvel Award|url=http://www.mississippimusicfoundation.org/sponsors/#the-winners|website=Mississippi Music Foundation|publisher=MMF|accessdate=May 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 2015 AMG Heritage Awards, Cook was presented with a ''"Citation of Excellence"'' from the North Carolina Secretary of State, [[Elaine Marshall]]. The citation was given to Cook for the development of continued arts programing and mentoring he has implemented across the country.&lt;ref name="Cook Receives Citation From NC Secretary of State Elaine Marshall"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cook|first1=David L|title=Cook Receives Citation From NC Secretary of State Elaine Marshall|url=http://www.enquirerjournal.com/features/amg-heritage-awards-show-planned/article_3e4907da-7a7b-11e5-be46-07f822c4064a.html|website=Enquirer Journal|publisher=Enquirer Journal|accessdate=May 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Entrepreneurship==
In 1988, Cook had incorporated '''Cook's Car Care Company''' in his native [[Fort Lauderdale]]. Eventually he transferred his interests to certain family members. The company is still in business today under different ownership.&lt;ref name="SUNBIZ.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sunbiz.org/scripts/cordet.exe?action=DETFIL&amp;inq_doc_number=J89845&amp;inq_came_from=NAMFWD&amp;cor_web_names_seq_number=0000&amp;names_name_ind=N&amp;names_cor_number=&amp;names_name_seq=&amp;names_name_ind=&amp;names_comp_name=COOKSCARCARE&amp;names_filing_type=|title=SUNBIZ|accessdate=December 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He incorporated Cook Productions International in 1989 with his business partner Edward Cook.&lt;!-- any relation?? --&gt; Cook &lt;!-- which Cook?? --&gt;sold his interests in 1992, which dissolved the Florida division.&lt;ref name="SUNBIZ.org"/&gt;

In 1999 Cook started ''DLC Records'' after leaving Mountainview Records due to contractual and other disputes. While on the label Cook took his 1999 project, ''In The Middle of it All'', up the charts garnering several No. 1 singles, a [[Dove Award]] nomination and became the number one selling Christian country artists of all time.&lt;ref name="Official bio"/&gt; He incorporated Cook Enterprises to administer his contracts and personal business affairs, which included a children's television show development agreement with his management group, Five Star Music which produced a weekly show called, ''Crabbottom USA'', taped at local television station, [[WHTV]] TV-39, a [[Nashville Tennessee]] based station.&lt;ref name="Official bio"/&gt;

In 2004, Cook was presented with the opportunity to become the CEO and controlling partner for the International Academy of Music Arts and Sciences (IAMAS Corporation).&lt;ref name="IAMAS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iamascorp.com/about.php|title=IAMAS Corporation|publisher=IAMAS Corporation|accessdate=December 15, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090505035859/http://www.iamascorp.com/about.php|archivedate=May 5, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Years earlier, the company merged with its daughter company, The American Musical Academy of Arts Association, which proved profitable as there was an upswing in demand for Christian-based music and distribution opportunities. This was profitable as IAMAS was able to use its history in the entertainment industry as a door to help boost other smaller companies into existence.&lt;ref name="IAMAS"/&gt; In 2004, the entertainment industry took a huge hit with the incoming markets of [[Napster]], [[iTunes]], and [[Amazon.com]]. IAMAS, no longer able to compete, decided to sell off only its American division and retain its overseas holdings. Since IAMAS Corporation had handled Cook's contracts since 1980, Cook offered to buy the company for an undisclosed amount. His offer was accepted and he officially filed for corporation status on November 24, 2004.&lt;ref name="North Carolina Secretary of State"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.secretary.state.nc.us/corporations/searchresults.aspx?onlyactive=OFF&amp;Words=STARTING&amp;searchstr=The%20International%20Academy%20of%20Music%20Arts%20and%20Sciences|title=North Carolina Secretary of State|publisher=State of North Carolina|accessdate=December 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cook became the president and [[CEO]] of the Charlotte Civic Orchestra in 2005 and although he retired as CEO in 2011, Cook remains on the board as an adviser. The organization is a 501(c)(3) company, and is entirely composed of volunteers.&lt;ref name="Cook retires as president of Charlotte Civic Orchestra"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cook|first=David L|title=Cook retires as president of Charlotte Civic Orchestra|url=http://charlottecivicorchestra.org/boardhistory.html|publisher=Charlotte Civic Orchestra|accessdate=May 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2011, Cook and several others launched the Artists Music Guild, a network based company that connects artists with industry professionals who advise them and lead them in the proper course for career mapping. Cook is listed as the executive board president.&lt;ref name="Artists Music Guild"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artistsmusicguild.com/content/meet-your-guild-board|title=Meet Your Guild Board: Artists Music Guild|accessdate=March 19, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110114225636/http://artistsmusicguild.com/content/meet-your-guild-board|archivedate=January 14, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the retirement of longtime manager Mickey Hiter, Cook signed with Pink Hammer Entertainment out of [[Los Angeles, California]] in August 2012.&lt;ref name="Cook signs with Pink Hammer Entertainment"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cook|first=David L.|title=Cook pens new management agreement|url=http://www.pinkhammerent.com/#announcements|work=Britani Golden|publisher=Pink Hammer Entertainment|accessdate=September 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pink Hammer Announces Cook to their New Roster"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hammer|first=Pink|title=Cook signs with pink Hammer Entertainment|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2012/9/prweb9878469.htm|publisher=Pink Hammer Entertainment|accessdate=September 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artists Music Guild==
Cook and other entertainment industry insiders started the [[Artists Music Guild]] in January 2011 to reduce the risks of artists being taken advantage of in a predatory industry.&lt;ref name="AMG Guild Board of Directors"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Guild|first1=Artists Music|title=Guild Board of Directors|url=http://artistsmusicguild.com/content/meet-your-guild-board|publisher=Artists Music Guild Inc.|accessdate=October 25, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110114225636/http://artistsmusicguild.com/content/meet-your-guild-board|archivedate=January 14, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On November 11, 2011, The Artists Music Guild held its inaugural convention at the historic [[Heritage USA]] complex. The inaugural convention was filmed for a [[PBS]] special, ''A Walk Through the History of Music in the United States'', with more than 2000 people in attendance. Cook has stated that his main goal for making the Heritage USA the official home of the Artists Music Guild's convention was to heal the broken people who were affected by the fall of PTL. The convention reunited several of the former PTL Singers, including Toni Bogart, Brian Keith, Lee Young and Sandy and Russell Hosey. Also in attendance were many of the employees who lost their jobs amid the sexual and financial scandal which caused the fall of the Bakker's ministry.&lt;ref name="Cook Reunites Former PTL Singers"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cook reunites former PTL Singers|url=http://www.fortmilltimes.com/2011/11/11/1783845/guild-event-to-reunite-artists.html|work=Artists Music Guild|publisher=Fort Mill Times|accessdate=November 29, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426010235/http://www.fortmilltimes.com/2011/11/11/1783845/guild-event-to-reunite-artists.html|archivedate=April 26, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cook posited that "''by reuniting these individuals who have not performed together in over twenty plus years it would allow them to come together on their own terms and walk out of the complex without someone telling them they could never come back. It was the ultimate form of healing the hurts from the past.''"&lt;ref name="Cook Reunites Former PTL Singers"/&gt; In 2015 the Guild became the parent company for the Mississippi Music Foundation in an effort to build a youth orchestra and a better outreach to educating and developing young and upcoming artists.
