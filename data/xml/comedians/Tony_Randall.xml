In 1958, Randall played the leading role in the Broadway [[musical comedy]] ''[[Oh, Captain!]]'', taking on a role originated on film by [[Alec Guinness]].

[[File:Tony Randall Jack Klugman Odd Couple 1972.JPG|thumb|Randall with Jack Klugman in a publicity photo of ''The Odd Couple'', 1972]]
Randall returned to television in 1970 as Felix Unger in ''[[The Odd Couple (1970 TV series)|The Odd Couple]]'', opposite [[Jack Klugman]], a role lasting for five years. The names of Felix's children on ''The Odd Couple'' were Edna and Leonard, named for Randall's sister and Randall himself. 

In 1974, Randall and Jack Klugman appeared in television spots endorsing a ''[[Yahtzee]]'' spinoff, ''Challenge Yahtzee''. They appeared in character as Felix and Oscar, and the TV spots were filmed on the same set as ''The Odd Couple''.

In 1973, he was originally hired to play the voice of Templeton the gluttonous rat in ''[[Charlotte's Web (1973 film)|Charlotte's Web]]'', but was replaced at the last minute by [[Paul Lynde]], due his voice sounding too sophisticated and the director wanting Templeton to have a [[nasal voice]].

In September 1993, Randall and Jack Klugman reunited in the CBS-TV movie ''[[The Odd Couple: Together Again]]'' reprising their roles. The story began when, after Felix ruined plans for his daughter Edna's wedding, his wife Gloria threw him out of the house for 11 days, which left him no choice but to move back in with Oscar and to help him recover, getting him back in shape after throat cancer surgery left his voice very raspy.

Randall's later stage productions included ''Night Must Fall'' (1999) and ''Judgment at Nuremberg'' (2001).

===Guest appearances===
On September 4, 1955, Randall and Jack Klugman appeared together with [[Gena Rowlands]] in the episode "The Pirate's House" of the [[Columbia Broadcasting Company|CBS]] [[anthology series]], ''[[Appointment with Adventure]]''.

Randall was a frequent guest on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' and often spoke of his love of [[opera]], saying it was due in no small part to the salaciousness of many of the plotlines. He also admitted to sneaking tape recorders into operas to make his own private recordings. He chided [[Johnny Carson]] for his chain-smoking and was generally fastidious. At the time of his death, Randall had appeared as a guest on ''The Tonight Show'' 105 times, more often than any other celebrity.

Randall appeared frequently on ''[[What's My Line?]]'', ''[[Password (TV series)|Password]]'', ''[[The Hollywood Squares]]'', and the [[Pyramid (game show)|''$10,000'' and ''$20,000 Pyramids'']]. He also parodied his pompous image with an appearance as a "contestant" on ''[[The Gong Show]]'' in 1977.

First aired on October 11, 1980, Randall was a guest star on the 5th and final season of ''[[The Muppet Show]]''. This was the 100th episode of the show.

Randall, along with [[John Goodman]] and [[Drew Barrymore]], was one of the first guests on the debut episode of ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'' on September 13, 1993. He would also appear in [[Conan O'Brien|Conan's]] ''5th Anniversary Special'' with the character PimpBot 5000. Randall was a frequent guest as well on both of [[David Letterman]]'s late-night shows ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'' and the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'', making 70 appearances, according to his obituary in the ''[[Washington Post]]''; Letterman said that Randall was one of his favorite guests, along with [[Regis Philbin]].

On November 7, 1994, Randall appeared on the game show ''[[Jeopardy!]]'', as part of a Special Edition Celebrity ''Jeopardy!'' episode playing on behalf of the National Actors Theatre. He came in second place after [[Norman Schwarzkopf, Jr.|General Norman Schwarzkopf, Jr.]] and before Actress [[Stefanie Powers]], with a final score of $9,900.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=J!

===Other creative activities===
In 1973, Tony Randall and Jack Klugman recorded an album called ''The Odd Couple Sings'' for London Records. Roland Shaw and The London Festival Orchestra and Chorus provided the music and additional vocals.&lt;ref&gt;{{AllMusic | class= album |id = r63924 | tab = | label=The Odd Couple Sings | first= Jason | last=Ankeny | accessdate= 2011/12/20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The record was not a chart-topper but is a highly sought-after item for many ''Odd Couple'' fans.&lt;ref&gt;[[WLNY-TV]]. The Odd Couple marathon. January 1, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Randall and Klugman also collaborated for a series of television commercials for Eagle Brand snacks, which can be viewed on youtube.

A noted [[Storytelling|raconteur]], Randall co-wrote with Mike Mindlin a collection of amusing and sometimes racy show business anecdotes called ''Which Reminds Me'', published in 1989.

In keeping with his penchant for both championing and mocking the culture that he loved, during the [[Big Band]] era revival in the mid-1960s, he produced a record album of 1930s songs, ''Vo Vo De Oh Doe'', inspired by (and covering) [[The New Vaudeville Band]]'s one-hit wonder, "[[Winchester Cathedral (song)|Winchester Cathedral]]". He mimicked (and somewhat exaggerated) the [[vibrato]] style of [[Carmen Lombardo]], and the two of them once sang a duet of Lombardo's signature song "Boo Hoo (You've Got Me Crying for You)" on ''[[The Tonight Show]]''.

===Activism===
Randall was an advocate for the arts. During the summer of 1980, he served as the celebrity host of the [[New York Philharmonic Orchestra]]'s concerts in [[Central Park]], [[New York City]].

He was politically liberal. During the [[Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 1972|U.S. presidential primaries]] in [[United States presidential election, 1972|1972]], he appeared as the [[Celebrity activists in George McGovern's 1972 presidential campaign|featured celebrity]] at numerous fundraising house-parties for [[George McGovern presidential campaign, 1972|Democratic candidate]] [[George McGovern]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.myspace.com/georgemcgovern/photos/772035#%7B%22ImageId%22%3A772035%7D Invitation letter for "Together for McGovern at the Garden, June 14, 1972" (producer: Warren Beatty)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
[[File:Tony Randall best 800.jpg|thumb|Randall's headstone in [[Westchester Hills Cemetery]]]]

Randall was married to Florence Gibbs from 1938 until her death from cancer on April 18, 1992. The following year, he said, "I wish I believed I'd see my parents again, see my wife again. But I know it's not going to happen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=September 25, 2003 |title=Aging Actor Tony Randall Fantasizes About His Funeral}}&lt;/ref&gt; He remarried on November 17, 1995, to Heather Harlan, an intern in one of his theatrical programs. At the time, Tony was 75 years old and Heather, 25. They lived in a Manhattan apartment and bought a vacation apartment in [[Key Biscayne, Florida]], in 2003. The couple, who had two children, Julia born on April 11 1997 and Jefferson born on June 15 1998, remained married until his death in May 2004.&lt;ref name="claire2008"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.marieclaire.com/sex-love/advice/a1123/tony-randall-wife/ |title=The Odd Couple |first=Judith |last=Newman |authorlink=Judith Newman |journal=[[Marie Claire]] |date=28 January 2008 |issn=0025-3049}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''Which Reminds Me,'' Randall maintained that any publicity an actor generates should be about his work, not himself.  "The public knows only one thing about me: I don't smoke."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P006ZhJSGMkC&amp;dq=which+reminds+me&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=smoke|title=Which Reminds Me|last=Randall|first=Tony|last2=Mindlin|first2=Michael|publisher=Delacorte Press|year=1989|isbn=0-385-29785-8|location=New York|pages=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;
