'''Julian Peter McDonald Clary''' (born 25 May 1959) is an English comedian, actor, presenter and novelist. Openly gay, Clary began  appearing on television in the mid-1980s and became known for his deliberately stereotypical [[camp (style)|camp]] style.&lt;ref name="The Guardian"/&gt; Since then he has also acted in films, television and stage productions, and was the winner of ''[[Celebrity Big Brother 10]]'' in 2012.

==Early life and education==
Clary was born in [[Surbiton]], Surrey, to Brenda (née McDonald), a probation officer, and Peter J. Clary, a policeman. He was brought up in [[Teddington]] with two older sisters. By his own account, he was conceived "in broad daylight" in [[Clacton-on-Sea]] in 1958. Two of his great-grandparents were Germans who immigrated to Britain at the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WDYTYA? Series Two: Celebrity Gallery|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/familyhistory/get_started/wdytya_s2_celeb_gallery_04.shtml|publisher=BBC|accessdate=7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was raised a Catholic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/close-up/talks-camp-comedian-julian-clary-3474405|title=Close Up talks to camp comedian Julian Clary|publisher=tvnz.co.nz|date= |accessdate=12 May 2010}}:(Commentary; ''"The conservatively raised Catholic with the flawless skin is now happy to confront aging and he is taking it literally in his stride."'')&lt;/ref&gt; He later studied English and drama at [[Goldsmiths, University of London|Goldsmiths' College, University of London]].

==Career==

===Stand-up comedy===
Clary began his career under the name Leo Hurll, a fake keyboardist for pop band Thinkman (a recording project conceived by [[Rupert Hine]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkBLM_C4iIA |title=visible in the video for the song "Formula" |publisher=YouTube.com |date= |accessdate=7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Julian Clary confirms this in his autobiography, ''A young man's passage''.&lt;/ref&gt; He entered the [[alternative comedy]] scene in the early 1980s, first under the alias "Gillian Pieface", and later as "The Joan Collins Fanclub". He wore heavy [[glamour (presentation)|glam]] make-up and dressed in outrageous clothes, often involving leather/PVC and hinting at [[Bondage (BDSM)|bondage]]. His pet dog "Fanny the Wonder Dog", a [[whippet]], also featured in performances.&lt;ref name=TheatreWorkshop/&gt;

Since then, Clary has undertaken several successful tours of his stage act, four of which have been released on home video, including ''The Mincing Machine Tour'' (1989), ''My Glittering Passage'' (1993), ''Lord of the Mince'' (2011), and ''Position Vacant: Apply Within'', which ran throughout the autumn of 2012 and between April and June 2013. In April 2014 he took the show to Australia and New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://julianclary.co.uk/positionvacantapplywithin.html#promo |title=Julian Clary's Official Website |publisher=Julianclary.co.uk |date=27 April 2014 |accessdate=7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clary's latest tour, ''The Joy of Mincing'', toured the UK throughout 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Julian Clary on Twitter|url=https://twitter.com/julianclary/status/640482147934052353|website=www.twitter.com|accessdate=14 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was named as the Ambassador for the 2016 [[Adelaide Fringe Festival|Adelaide Fringe comedy festival]], responsible for promoting the festival internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=British comic Julian Clary named 2016 Fringe ambassador|url=https://www.adelaidefringe.com.au/news/british-comic-julian-clary-named-2016-fringe-ambassador|website=www.adelaidefringe.com.au|accessdate=14 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television===
After a number of appearances on ''[[Saturday Live (UK TV series)|Friday Night Live]]'' in the mid-late 1980s,&lt;ref name=Scotsman&gt;{{cite news|title=Interview: Julian Clary, comedian|url=http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/interview-julian-clary-comedian-1-832933|accessdate=14 November 2015|work=The Scotsman|date=9 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clary co-hosted the short-lived [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] game show ''Trick or Treat'' in 1989 with [[Mike Smith (television presenter)|Mike Smith]], before achieving greater success later that year with his own high-camp [[Channel 4]] gameshow, ''[[Sticky Moments with Julian Clary]]''.&lt;ref name=Millard&gt;{{cite news|last1=Millard|first1=Rosie|title=Sticky Moments|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/sticky-moments-1584972.html|accessdate=14 November 2015|work=The Independent|date=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; More a vehicle for his brand of humour than a genuine gameshow, ''Sticky Moments'' was a light-hearted "non-quiz" satire, with him often awarding points because he liked the contestants, rather than because they possessed a particular skill or aptitude. He later starred in the 1992 audience participation sitcom ''[[Terry and Julian]]'' with [[Lee Simpson]], again for Channel 4.&lt;ref name=Millard/&gt; His next series was the BBC's studio-based ''[[All Rise for Julian Clary]]'' in 1996, in which he played a judge in a mock courtroom setting.&lt;ref name=TheatreWorkshop&gt;{{cite web|title=The Theatre Workshop: Julian Clary|url=http://www.thetheatreworkshop.com/julian-clary/|website=www.thetheatreworkshop.com|accessdate=13 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, he played a cameo guest star part in the BBC drama, ''[[Virtual Murder (TV series)|Virtual Murder]]''. In his episode, "A Dream of Dracula", he played an undertaker, alongside other guest stars including [[Alfred Marks]], [[Jill Gascoine]], [[Ronald Fraser (actor)|Ronald Fraser]] and [[Peggy Mount]]. He also appeared in an episode of the improvisational comedy show ''[[Whose Line Is It Anyway? (UK TV series)|Whose Line Is It Anyway?]]''

In 1993, he made an infamous appearance at the [[British Comedy Awards]] where he made a joke comparing the set to [[Hampstead Heath]] (a famed London [[cruising for sex|cruising area]] for gay men) and stated that he had just been [[fisting]] the then-[[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Norman Lamont]].&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|iAU7pATH5_M|Julian Clary – Norman Lamont}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the joke was met with uproarious laughter from the audience, he was criticised in some newspapers, including the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' and ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'', who launched an unsuccessful campaign to have him banned from television.&lt;ref name=Roberts&gt;{{cite news|last1=Roberts|first1=Scott|title=Julian Clary: No regrets over my infamous joke about Norman Lamont|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2014/10/07/julian-clary-no-regrets-over-my-infamous-joke-about-norman-lamont/|accessdate=14 November 2015|work=Pink News|date=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
From 1998 to 2001, he hosted three series of the Sky TV show ''[[Prickly Heat (game show)|Prickly Heat]]'', the first two series with [[Davina McCall]], the last one with [[Denise van Outen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Van Outen joins Clary for second run of Prickly Heat|url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/van-outen-joins-clary-for-second-run-of-prickly-heat/1213716.article|website=www.broadcastnow.co.uk|accessdate=14 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, from 1999 to 2002 he was the face of [[Daz (detergent)|Daz]] laundry detergent, taking over from [[Shane Richie]], [[Michael Barrymore]] and [[Danny Baker]]. He is a recurring performer and one of the most popular performers in the [[ITV Panto]]s. He played 'The 1st Henchman' &amp; 'Tim' in 1998's ''Jack and The Beanstalk''; 'The Good Fairy' in 2000's ''Cinderella''; 'The Genie of the Lamp' in 2000's ''Aladdin''; and, possibly his most favourite character, 'Chris the Cat' in 2002's ''Dick Whittington''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Television Pantomimes|url=http://www.its-behind-you.com/tvpanto.html|website=www.its-behind-you.com|accessdate=14 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, he became a team captain on the quiz show ''[[It's Only TV...but I Like It]]'' &lt;ref name=Lane&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lane|first1=Harriet|title=Behind you? Oh, no it's not|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2002/dec/08/features.review17|accessdate=14 November 2015|work=The Observer|date=8 December 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with [[Phill Jupitus]] and [[Jonathan Ross (television presenter)|Jonathan Ross]]. In 2003, he presented the first series of the Japanese TV clip show, ''[[Sushi TV]]'' for [[Challenge (TV channel)|Challenge]]. In 2004, he took part in the [[BBC]] series ''[[Strictly Come Dancing]]'', finishing third with his partner [[Erin Boag]].&lt;ref name=TheatreWorkshop/&gt; In 2005, he hosted ''Come and Have A Go'' for the [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Lottery Come and Have a Go...|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2005/03_march/14/lottery.shtml|website=www.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=14 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 February 2006, he appeared on the [[BBC]] programme ''[[Who Do You Think You Are? (UK TV series)|Who Do You Think You Are?]]'', a [[genealogy]] series which traced his [[ancestor]]s to a World War I [[flight engineer]] and German immigrants among both his mother's and father's forebears.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who Do You Think You Are?: Julian Clary|url=http://www.whodoyouthinkyouaremagazine.com/episode/julian-clary|website=www.whodoyouthinkyouaremagazine.co.uk|accessdate=14 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2006, and again in April 2008, he hosted an episode of the topical quiz show ''[[Have I Got News for You]]''.&lt;ref name=Scotsman/&gt;

In September 2006, he returned to primetime TV as presenter and judge on Channel 5's brand new celebrity performance programme ''[[The All Star Talent Show]]''. He was joined by two guest judges every week to assess celebrity performances and co-presented with [[Myleene Klass]] and [[Andi Peters]]. He also narrated the Channel 5 children's series ''[[The Little Princess (animated series)|The Little Princess]]'' with [[Jane Horrocks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Julian Clary|url=http://www.julianclary.co.uk/aboutjulianclary.html|website=www.julianclary.co.uk|accessdate=14 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2006, he joined the panel of ''[[QI]]'',&lt;ref name=Blake&gt;{{cite news|last1=Blake|first1=Elissa|title=Julian Clary: The cutting-edge riposte|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/comedy/julian-clary-the-cuttingedge-riposte-20140410-36e69.html|accessdate=14 November 2015|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=12 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[panel game]]/comedy show hosted by [[Stephen Fry]] and also appeared on an episode of ''[[The New Paul O'Grady Show]]''.

In 2007, he made a cameo appearance in the Australian soap opera, ''[[Neighbours]]'', in scenes filmed in London with [[Natalie Bassingthwaighte]].&lt;ref name=Donaldson&gt;{{cite web|last1=Donaldson|first1=Brian|title=5 things you might not know about Julian Clary|url=https://www.list.co.uk/article/45782-5-things-you-might-not-know-about-julian-clary/|website=www.list.co.uk|publisher=The List|accessdate=14 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 20 March 2007, Clary presented a brand-new show for the [[BBC]] called ''The Underdog Show''. Celebrities and children were paired up with rescue dogs. They then commenced training and competed against each other in obedience and agility trials in a live arena. The show ran until 26 April 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Underdog Show: About the show|url=http://www.bbcattic.org/underdogshow/about/index.shtml|website=www.bbcattic.org|publisher=BBC|accessdate=14 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was also a short-notice guest on ''[[The Paul O'Grady Show]]'' in October 2008, after [[Peter Andre]] and [[Katie Price]] couldn't appear (Clary and O'Grady are friends and neighbours).&lt;ref name=Jackson&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jackson|first1=Tina|title=My family values: Julian Clary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/jul/24/julian-clary-family-values|accessdate=14 November 2015|work=The Guardian|date=24 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film===
Clary appeared in the film ''[[Carry On Columbus]]'' (1992),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Carry On Columbus: cast list|url=https://film.list.co.uk/listings/carry-on/|website=www.film.list.co.uk|accessdate=14 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; an unsuccessful attempt to revive the "[[Carry On films|Carry On]]" series of films. It was widely panned by critics, but was more financially profitable than the two other Columbus films released the same year: ''[[1492: Conquest of Paradise]]'' and ''[[Christopher Columbus: The Discovery]]''.

Clary returned to film in 2001 in the film ''The Baby Juice Express'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=British Board of Film Classification: Baby Juice Express|url=http://www.bbfc.co.uk/releases/baby-juice-express-2001|website=www.bbfc.co.uk|accessdate=14 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which starred [[Lisa Faulkner]], [[Samantha Womack]], [[Ruth Jones]] and [[David Seaman]], about a prisoner who is desperate to find some way of conceiving with his wife whilst he is in prison, but the sperm ends up getting hijacked. It was released on DVD in 2004.

===Radio===
Clary appeared on ''The Big Fun Show'' in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Big Fun Show|url=http://www.radiolistings.co.uk/programmes/b/bi/big_fun_show__the.html|website=www.radiolistings.co.uk|accessdate=14 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992 Clary hosted a radio show for the BBC called ''Intimate Contact'', the premise of which was for him to act as a genial 'Mr Fix-it' for a wide range of 'punter' problems. Clary attempted to solve these issues over the telephone, with the assistance of roving reporter "Hugh Jelly" (actor [[Philip Herbert (actor)|Philip Herbert]]).
