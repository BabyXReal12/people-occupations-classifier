'''Julie Deborah Kavner''' (born September 7, 1950) is an American actress. She first attracted notice for her role as Brenda Morgenstern, the younger sister of Valerie Harper's title character in the sitcom ''[[Rhoda]]'', for which she won a [[Primetime Emmy Award]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress - Comedy Series|Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series]]. She is best known for her voice role as [[Marge Simpson]] on the animated television series ''[[The Simpsons]]''. She also voices other characters for the show, including Marge’s mother, [[Simpson family#Jacqueline Bouvier|Jacqueline Bouvier]], and sisters [[Patty and Selma|Patty and Selma Bouvier]].

Known for her improvisation and distinctive "honeyed gravel voice",&lt;ref name="darling"/&gt; Kavner was cast in her first professional acting role as [[Brenda Morgenstern]] in ''[[Rhoda]]'' in 1974. She received four [[Primetime Emmy Award]] nominations for playing the character, winning the award in 1978. Following ''Rhoda'', Kavner was cast in ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]'', which debuted in 1987. ''The Tracey Ullman Show'' included a series of [[The Simpsons shorts|animated shorts]] about a [[dysfunctional family]]. Voices were needed for the shorts, and the producers asked Kavner to voice Marge. The shorts were spun off into ''The Simpsons''.

Kavner has been described as "nearly reclusive"; part of her contract says that she will never have to promote ''The Simpsons'' on video. For her work as Marge, Kavner received another [[Primetime Emmy Award]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance|Outstanding Voice-Over Performance]] in 1992 and an [[Annie Award]] nomination for her performance as the character in ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]''.

Typically cast as a "woman who is supportive, sympathetic or self-effacingly funny",&lt;ref name="darling"/&gt; Kavner grew to dislike playing such roles. In 1992, she starred in ''[[This Is My Life (1992 film)|This Is My Life]]'', her first leading role in a feature film. Kavner has also appeared in live-action roles in six [[Woody Allen filmography|films written]] by [[Woody Allen]], and in the [[Adam Sandler]] comedy ''[[Click (2006 film)|Click]]''.

==Early life==
Kavner was born in Los Angeles, California, on September 7, 1950,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Today in History - September 7|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20468369/|publisher=[[MSNBC]]|date=2007-09-07|accessdate=2009-02-13|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; the second daughter of Rose (1918-2010), a family counselor, and David Kavner (1917-2016), a furniture manufacturer,&lt;ref name="darling"/&gt; and grew up in [[Southern California]]. Her family is [[Jews|Jewish]]. She decided to pursue a career in acting because "There was nothing else I wanted to do, ever".&lt;ref name="darling"/&gt; She attended Beverly Hills High School (which she later admitted she hated), where she was "something of a loner", and unsuccessfully tried out for several plays.&lt;ref name="darling"/&gt; [[John Ingle]], formerly the chairman of the Beverly Hills High School art department, later commented that Kavner was "excellent at improvisation, but she wasn't an [[ingenue (stock character)|ingenue]] and not that castable at that age".&lt;ref name="darling"/&gt;

After graduating from high school, Kavner attended [[San Diego State University]] and majored in drama, being cast in several productions including a role as [[Charlotte Corday]] in ''[[Marat/Sade]]'', becoming known for her improvisation and ability to do both comedy and drama. After graduating in 1971, she got a day job as a typist at the [[UCLA School of the Arts and Architecture]].&lt;ref name="darling"/&gt;

==Career==

===Early career===
In 1973, Kavner auditioned for a role as one of [[Rhoda Morgenstern]]'s sisters in ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]''. David Davis, producer of the show, had convinced her to audition for the part, but decided to cast another actress instead.&lt;ref name="Boston"&gt;{{Cite news|title=From sitcoms to films, Kavner is true to her characters|work=[[Boston Globe]]|author=Golden, Daniel|date=1991-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, Rhoda Morgenstern became the leading character in a spin-off called ''[[Rhoda]]''. Kavner was cast in her first professional acting role as [[Brenda Morgenstern]], sister of the eponymous character.&lt;ref name="darling"/&gt; ''Rhoda'' ran on [[CBS]] from September 9, 1974, to December 1978. She received four [[Primetime Emmy Award]] nominations for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress - Comedy Series|Outstanding Continuing Performance by a Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series]] for playing Brenda, winning in 1978.&lt;ref name="emmys"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/award_history_search |title=Primetime Emmy Awards Advanced Search|publisher=Emmys.org|accessdate=2009-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also received four [[Golden Globe Award]] nominations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goldenglobes.org/browse/member/29391 |title=Julie Kavner |publisher=Hollywood Foreign Press Agency |accessdate=2009-02-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080830042711/http://www.goldenglobes.org/browse/member/29391 |archivedate=2008-08-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, she received [[Daytime Emmy Award]] nomination for her starring role in the daytime special ''The Girl Who Couldn't Lose''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/celebrities/julie-kavner/bio/159366|title=Julie Kavner|work=[[TV Guide]]|accessdate=2009-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following ''Rhoda'', Kavner had a guest appearance on ''[[Taxi (TV series)|Taxi]]''&lt;ref name="Winding"&gt;{{cite news|title=Kavner's long and winding Rhoda|url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/article/621566|work=[[Toronto Star]]|date=2009-04-21|accessdate=2009-04-21|author=Salem, Rob}}&lt;/ref&gt; and appeared in the 1985 comedy ''[[Bad Medicine (film)|Bad Medicine]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title='Bad Medicine' overdoses on bad jokes|date=1985-11-26|author=Christiansen, Richard|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the 1987 film ''[[Surrender (1987 film)|Surrender]]'', both of which were box office failures.&lt;ref name="Lift"/&gt; She appeared in the television movies ''[[Revenge of the Stepford Wives]]'', ''No Other Love'' and ''A Fine Romance'', and shot a television pilot.&lt;ref name="darling"/&gt; She also starred in several stage plays, including a play called ''It Had to be You''&lt;ref name="Lift"/&gt; at a dinner theater in [[Canada]], ''Particular Friendships'' in [[New York City]] in 1981,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Theater: 'Particular Friendships', A First Play|url=http://theater2.nytimes.com/mem/theater/treview.html?pagewanted=print&amp;res=9F0CEFDC1539F932A35753C1A967948260|work=The New York Times|date=1981-10-01|accessdate=2009-02-13|author=Rich, Frank}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Two for the Seesaw'', directed by [[Burt Reynolds]].&lt;ref name="Lift"/&gt; [[Woody Allen]] first saw Kavner one night while he was watching ''Rhoda'' in the 1970s. He thought that she was remarkable and later offered her a role in his 1986 film ''[[Hannah and Her Sisters]]''.&lt;ref name="Boston"/&gt; Kavner agreed, and credits Allen and the film with rejuvenating her career.&lt;ref name="Lift"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Coming into her own - Kavner's sagging career got needed lift from Allen films|work=[[Syracuse Herald-Journal]]|author=Vadeboncoeur, John E.|date=1992-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kavner was then cast as a sidekick to [[Tracey Ullman]] in ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]'', which debuted on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in 1987. Kavner described the show as, "like being back in school, a chance to play a wide variety of characters, some really vicious people, to not rest on laurels, to not play it safe".&lt;ref name="darling"/&gt; Kavner commented, "What I do is not mimicry or an impersonation, but more of an assimilation. [On ''The Tracey Ullman Show''] we did a lot of looking at people to find out who to base our characters on. We did our homework on our lunch hour."&lt;ref name="darling"/&gt; She received four Primetime Emmy Award nominations for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program|Best Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program]].&lt;ref name="emmys"/&gt;

===''The Simpsons''===
[[File:Julie Kavner.jpg|right|upright|thumb|Kavner in 2009]]
Kavner became most famous for her role as [[Marge Simpson]] on the animated television show ''[[The Simpsons]]'', a show that continues to the present. ''The Tracey Ullman Show'' included [[The Simpsons shorts|a series of animated shorts]] about the dysfunctional Simpson family. Voices were needed for the shorts, so the producers decided to ask Kavner and fellow cast member [[Dan Castellaneta]] to voice Marge and Homer rather than hire more actors.&lt;ref name="The Age"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/02/27/1046064146568.html|title=D'oh, you're the voices|accessdate=2009-02-10|date=2003-02-27|author=Lee, Luaine|publisher=[[The Age]] | location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FN"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,129665,00.html|title=D'oh!: The Voice of Homer Is Deceivingly Deadpan|accessdate=2009-02-10|date=2008-08-18|author=Elber, Lynn|agency=Associated Press|work=Fox News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kavner has what Hilary de Vries of ''[[The New York Times]]'' described as a "honeyed gravel voice".&lt;ref name="darling"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CEFDF1F38F935A15752C0A964958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=1|title='Darling! Listen to Me'|accessdate=2009-02-10|date=1992-01-26|author=De Vries, Hilary|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kavner says her distinctive voice is due to "a bump on [her] vocal cords".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The actress with the one-of-a-kind voice stars in Nora Ephron's comedy 'This is my Life'.|date=1992-03-13|work=[[The Orlando Sentinel]]|author=Haun, Harry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Marge is her most famous character, Kavner's favorite characters to voice are her sisters [[Patty and Selma|Patty and Selma Bouvier]] because "they're really funny and sad at the same time".&lt;ref name="Hamilton"&gt;{{cite news|title=Ay caramba!: Only TV could call this work|date=1996-12-31|work=[[The Hamilton Spectator]]|author=Duffy, Mike}}&lt;/ref&gt; Series creator [[Matt Groening]] instructed Kavner to voice the duo as characters who "suck the life out of everything".&lt;ref&gt;Groening, Matt. (2001). Commentary for "[[Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire]]", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete First Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt; Both have similar raspy voices, but Patty's voice is more masculine and has a lower register, while Selma's voice is a little sweeter.&lt;ref name="Jean"&gt;Jean, Al. (2004). Commentary for "[[Selma's Choice]]", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Fourth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt; Kavner also provides the voices of every other female member of the Bouvier family, including Marge's mother [[Jaqueline Bouvier|Jacqueline]], Great-Aunt Gladys (a dead relative who was introduced on season four's "[[Selma's Choice]]"), and an unnamed grandmother seen on the season six episode "[[Fear of Flying (The Simpsons)|Fear of Flying]]".&lt;ref name="Jean"/&gt;

Part of Kavner's contract says that she will never have to promote ''The Simpsons'' on video and she rarely performs Marge's voice in public because she believes it "destroys the illusion. People feel these are real people."&lt;ref name="Hamilton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sheridan"&gt;{{cite news|title=Meet the Simpsons|date=2004-05-06|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|Daily Express]]|author=Sheridan, Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kavner takes recording sessions seriously, and feels that voice acting is, "a little more limiting than live acting. And I have nothing to do with my character's movement."&lt;ref name="Water"&gt;{{cite news|title=Treading 'Water' Julie Kavner takes break from Marge Simpson to star in Woody Allen's TV Movie |date=1994-09-18|work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|author=Weiskind, Ron}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nancy Cartwright]], who voices [[Bart Simpson]], said in her book ''[[My Life as a 10-Year-Old Boy]]'' that Kavner is "a workhorse of an actor" with "extraordinary professionalism and quiet work ethic", and notes that she is rarely late for recording sessions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cartwright |first=Nancy|title=[[My Life as a 10-Year-Old Boy]]|year=2000|publisher=[[Hyperion (publisher)|Hyperion]]|page=48|location=New York City|isbn=0-7868-8600-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 1998, Kavner was paid $30,000 per episode. During a pay dispute in 1998, Fox threatened to replace the six main voice actors with new actors, going as far as preparing to cast new voices.&lt;ref name=Glaister/&gt; However, the dispute was soon resolved and she received $125,000 per episode until 2004 when the voice actors demanded that they be paid $360,000 an episode.&lt;ref name=Glaister&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/04/02/1080544690429.html|title=Simpsons actors demand bigger share|accessdate=2009-02-10|date=2004-04-03|author=Glaister, Dan|publisher=''The Age'' | location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue was resolved a month later,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/05/01/entertainment/main615066.shtml|title='Simpsons' Cast Goes Back To Work|accessdate=2009-02-10|date=2004-05-01|publisher=[[CBS News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Kavner earned $250,000 per episode.&lt;ref name="Sheridan"/&gt; After salary re-negotiations in 2008, the voice actors received approximately $400,000 per episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Simpsons cast sign new pay deal | publisher = BBC News | date = 2008-06-03 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7434296.stm | accessdate=2009-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later, with Fox threatening to cancel the series unless production costs were cut, Kavner and the other cast members accepted a 30 percent pay cut, down to just over $300,000 per episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Block|first=Alex Ben|title='The Simpsons' Renewed for Two More Seasons|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/simpsons-renewed-two-more-seasons-245748|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate=October 15, 2011|date=October 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[44th Primetime Emmy Awards]], Kavner received a [[Primetime Emmy Award]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance|Outstanding Voice-Over Performance]] for voicing Marge in the [[The Simpsons (season 3)|season three]] episode "[[I Married Marge]]".&lt;ref name="emmys"/&gt; In 2004, Kavner and [[Dan Castellaneta]] won a [[Young Artist Award]] for "Most Popular Mom &amp; Dad in a TV Series".&lt;ref name="YAA"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.youngartistawards.org/noms25.htm |title=25th Annual Winners and Nominees |accessdate=2009-02-10 |publisher=Youngartistawards.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817061116/http://www.youngartistawards.org/noms25.htm |archivedate=2016-08-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For her performance in ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]'', Kavner was nominated for "Best Voice Acting in an Animated Feature" at the 2007 [[Annie Awards]], but lost to [[Ian Holm]] from ''[[Ratatouille (film)|Ratatouille]]''.&lt;ref name="A35"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://annieawards.org/foryourconsideration.html |title=For Your Consideration |accessdate=2009-02-10 |date=2007-12-31 |publisher=Annie Awards |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090217224351/http://annieawards.org/foryourconsideration.html |archivedate=2009-02-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/awardcentral_article/VR1117980588.html?nav=news&amp;categoryid=1983&amp;cs=1|title='Ratatouille' nearly sweeps Annies|accessdate=2009-02-10|date=2008-02-08|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|author=Debruge, Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kavner's emotional performance in the movie got positive reviews, and one critic said she "gave what must be the most heartfelt performance ever to find its way into a movie based on an irreverent cartoon".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.metroweekly.com/arts_entertainment/film.php?ak=2879 |title=Homer's Odyssey |publisher=Metro Weekly |accessdate=2009-02-10 |date=2007-07-26 |author=Shulman, Randy |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926231021/http://www.metroweekly.com/arts_entertainment/film.php?ak=2879 |archivedate=2007-09-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scenes in the movie, such as Marge's emotional video message to Homer, were recorded over one hundred times, leaving Kavner exhausted.&lt;ref name=moviesonline&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.moviesonline.ca/movienews_12524.html |title=The Simpsons Movie Interviews |author=Roberts, Sheila |accessdate=2009-02-10 |publisher=Movies Online |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090104132905/http://www.moviesonline.ca/movienews_12524.html |archivedate=2009-01-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Further career===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Julie Kavner - This is my life.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Kavner's portrayal of Dottie Ingels in ''[[This Is My Life (1992 film)|This Is My Life]]'' was her first leading role in a feature film.]] --&gt;
Many of Kavner's roles have been described by ''New York Times'' writer Hilary de Vries as a "woman who is supportive, sympathetic, or self-effacingly funny".&lt;ref name="darling"/&gt; Kavner grew to despise playing such roles, saying, "If it smacks of Brenda Morgenstern, I won't take the job."&lt;ref name="darling"/&gt; She had a supporting role as Eleanor Costello, a nurse who befriends [[Robin Williams]]' character in the [[Academy Award]] nominated film ''[[Awakenings]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Awakenings |url=http://www.variety.com/profiles/Film/main/24664/Awakenings.html?dataSet=1 |work=Variety |accessdate=2009-02-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090724205645/http://www.variety.com/profiles/Film/main/24664/Awakenings.html?dataSet=1 |archivedate=July 24, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kavner interviewed several nurses in preparation for the role, and [[Penny Marshall]], the director of the film, described Kavner as "a low-maintenance actor [...] You never have to worry about giving [her] back-story for her characters."&lt;ref name="darling"/&gt; In 1992, Kavner starred in ''[[This Is My Life (1992 film)|This Is My Life]]'', her first leading role in a feature film. Kavner played Dottie Ingels, an aspiring [[stand-up comedian]] who starts neglecting her family when her career begins to take off. Kavner described Dottie as "really selfish" but admitted, "I liked the role for that very reason."&lt;ref name="darling"/&gt; Kavner had been asked to play a character with a smaller role in the film, but [[Joe Roth]], at the time the chairman of [[20th Century Fox]], suggested that they cast a lesser known actress in the lead role.&lt;ref name="darling"/&gt; [[Nora Ephron]], the writer of ''This Is My Life'', said Kavner "has so little vanity that it is almost shocking. Not only does she have no demands as an actress - 'How big is my trailer, what's in my refrigerator?' - but she will do anything for the character if it makes sense to her."&lt;ref name="darling"/&gt;

==Personal life==
Kavner leads a private, "nearly reclusive" life, "discreet and guarded beyond the usual reticent star routine".&lt;ref name="darling"/&gt; She rarely makes public appearances and refuses to allow herself to be photographed at work, especially in the studio while doing ''The Simpsons''.&lt;ref name="Winding"/&gt; Her partner is retired producer [[David Davis (TV producer)|David Davis]]; they have lived together since 1976.&lt;ref name="Boston"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Winding"/&gt; In a 1992 interview with ''The New York Times'', Kavner said she was considering retiring, "except for doing three days a year for Woody [Allen]", but felt that if she did retire, she would receive a script she wanted "to do more than life itself".&lt;ref name="darling"/&gt;
