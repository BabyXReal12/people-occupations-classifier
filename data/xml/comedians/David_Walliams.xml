===Matt Lucas===
Walliams and [[Matt Lucas (comedian)|Matt Lucas]] first met at the [[National Youth Theatre]]. At their first meeting, Lucas did an impression of [[Jimmy Savile]] and Walliams an impression of [[Frankie Howerd]].

They were also stars of the Paramount Comedy Channel show ''Mash and Peas'', and it was in this guise that they appeared in the Fat Les video. Walliams and Lucas also had small roles in ''Plunkett and Maclaine'' as prisoners.

The duo appeared together in a music video for the [[Pet Shop Boys]] single "[[I'm with Stupid (Pet Shop Boys song)|I'm with Stupid]]", in which the two are apparently auditioning their version of the song's video for [[Neil Tennant]] and [[Chris Lowe]], who are tied up and appear to be hostages.

The pair are best known for ''[[Little Britain]]'', which ran from 2003 to 2009 on the BBC in the UK and from 2008 onwards on [[HBO]] in the USA. Among the characters Walliams played were [[Emily Howard (Little Britain)|Emily Howard]], a deluded "[[transvestism|transvestite]]"; [[Ray McCooney]], an insane Scottish hotel owner; and [[Sebastian Love]], an ''aide de camp'' to the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] (portrayed by [[Anthony Head]]) on whom Love has a huge crush. The characters from ''Little Britain'', played by Walliams and Lucas, appeared in a 2010 UK television advertising campaign for the [[Nationwide Building Society]]. In January 2005 Walliams and Lucas were named the [[Radio Times's Most Powerful People in TV Comedy|most powerful people in TV comedy]] by ''[[Radio Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Methven|first1=Nicola|date=11 January 2005|title=Lucas &amp; Walliams 'funniest'|url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Lucas+%26+Walliams+%27funniest%27-a0126878529|newspaper=[[Daily Mirror]]|location=London|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|issn=|oclc=223228477|access-date=13 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their later series was ''[[Come Fly with Me (2010 TV series)|Come Fly with Me]]'', a six-part series airing on BBC One.&lt;ref name="telegraph_comeflywithme"&gt;{{Cite news |url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/7780315/David-Walliams-and-Matt-Lucas-reunite-for-new-BBC-show-set-in-an-airport.html |newspaper = Daily Telegraph |title = David Walliams and Matt Lucas reunite for new BBC show set in an airport |date = 29 May 2010 |accessdate = 20 September 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first episode was the third most-watched programme of Christmas Day 2010, and the most watched comedy of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-12080132 |work=BBC News |title=EastEnders wins Christmas Day viewing figures battle on 28 January 2011, the BBC announced that the show had been commissioned for a second series. |date=26 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The duo have not worked or made any public appearances together since early 2011 (although they each make separate cameo appearances in [[Michael Winterbottom]]'s 2013 film [[The Look of Love (film)|''The Look of Love'']]).

=== Presenting ===
On 18 January 2018, Walliams hosted the [[Presidents Club]] annual charity fundraising dinner. The event was featured in a ''Financial Times'' article on 23 January 2018, where Maddison Marriage, an undercover journalist for the ''Financial Times'' who attended the event, explained "Over the course of six hours, many of the hostesses were subjected to groping, lewd comments and repeated requests to join diners in bedrooms elsewhere in the Dorchester... the [charity] auction offer[ed] a hint of the evening's seedier side. Lots included a night at Soho's Windmill strip club and a course of plastic surgery with the invitation to: "Add spice to your wife."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/075d679e-0033-11e8-9650-9c0ad2d7c5b5|title=Men Only: Inside the charity fundraiser where hostesses are put on show|last=Marriage|first=Madison|date=2018-01-23|website=Financial Times|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the article appeared the President Club closed "after being denounced in parliament and disavowed by the charities it supported."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/b07c37e8-00fa-11e8-9650-9c0ad2d7c5b5|title=Presidents Club to close after harassment scandal|last=|first=|date=|website=Financial Times|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walliams tweeted about his involvement in the event "Last Thursday night I hosted the Presidents Club annual charity fundraiser.

[[File:David Walliams Reading.jpg|thumb|190px|Walliams in 2015, reading one of his books to an audience in New Zealand, as part of the WORD Christchurch festival.]]In early 2008 Walliams signed a contract with [[HarperCollins]] to publish two children's books.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7148694.stm |title=Walliams plans children's stories |accessdate=23 December 2007|date=17 December 2007|work =BBC News Online |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The debut novel, ''[[The Boy in the Dress (novel)|The Boy in the Dress]]'', illustrated by [[Quentin Blake]], was released worldwide on 1 November 2008. It explores several of the themes of ''[[Little Britain]]'' from Walliams' own life on an emotional level, such as the [[Camp (style)|camp]] humour of [[cross-dressing]] and [[effeminacy]].&lt;ref name="AUS intrvw 08" /&gt; The story recounts a neglected 12-year-old boy called Dennis' search for a female role model, his friendship with the popular girl in school, and the ways in which relationships develop along gender lines. The story has a strong resonance with Anne Fine's 1989 book ''[[Bill's New Frock]]''. It was announced that this book will be adapted into a film for Christmas 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/news/a556687/david-walliams-boy-in-the-dress-to-be-bbc-one-film-for-christmas-2014.html |title=David Walliams' Boy in the Dress to be BBC One film for Christmas 2014 – TV News |publisher=Digital Spy |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2009 came ''[[Mr Stink]]'', again illustrated by [[Quentin Blake]], about a 12-year-old girl who meets a [[tramp]] and helps look after him. She keeps him hidden from her family. The book consists of 26 illustrated chapters full of jokes. It is aimed at teenagers and children over 9. It was the last of Walliams books to be illustrated by Quentin Blake. The book was awarded the Children's Award in the inaugural People's Book Prize in 2010,&lt;ref name="bookseller_stinkaward"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thebookseller.com/news/124051-walliams-among-winners-for-inaugural-peoples-book-prize.html |title=Walliams among winners for inaugural People's Book Prize |author=Neilan, Catherine |work=The Bookseller |date=10 July 2010 |accessdate=20 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100725153144/http://www.thebookseller.com/news/124051-walliams-among-winners-for-inaugural-peoples-book-prize.html |archivedate=25 July 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was made into a 60-minute film, which premiered on [[BBC One]] on 23 December 2012.

On 28 October 2010 Walliams published his third book ''[[Billionaire Boy]]'', illustrated by [[Tony Ross]].&lt;ref name="express"&gt;Sarah Kingsford, [http://www.express.co.uk/entertainment/books/207699/Review-Billionaire-Boy-by-David-Walliams Review: Billionaire Boy by David Walliams], Express, 24 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=publishdate&gt;{{cite web|title=Billionaire Boy : David Walliams|url=http://www.harpercollins.co.uk/9780007371433/billionaire-boy|work=HarperCollins|accessdate=1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; telling the story of Joe Spud, the richest 12-year-old in the country. Joe's father is a famous inventor, and his wealth means that Joe has everything he could ever want: his own bowling alley, cinema and a trained [[orangutan]] who serves as his butler, but there is just one thing he really needs: a friend.&lt;ref name="express" /&gt; The book included a 'billion pound note' that was used to enter a competition to win a day as a billionaire in London.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} This was the first of his books to be illustrated by Tony Ross.

Walliams' fourth book, ''[[Gangsta Granny]]'' was released in October 2011 and again illustrated by [[Tony Ross]]. It tells the story of Ben who is bored every time he is made to stay at his grandma's house as all she wants to do is to play board games and eat cabbage soup. Ben learns that she was once an international jewel thief and all her life she has wanted to steal the crown jewels. Ben is determined that they do it together. It won a [[Red House Children's Book Award]]&lt;ref name="Telegraph" /&gt; and was adapted to be a [[Gangsta Granny (film)|70-minute film]] for [[BBC One]] and shown on 26 December 2013.&lt;ref name="DailyPostWalliamsSuffering"&gt;{{cite news |last =Stephenson |first =Hannah |title =Walliams Suffering For His Gen Nerous Heart |newspaper =Daily Post|publisher =High Beam |date =4 November 2011|url =http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-271561710.html |accessdate =16 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2012 Walliams released his fifth children's book, ''[[Ratburger]]'', telling the story of a young girl named Zoe whose life is a misery as she has an evil stepmother. It was followed in September 2013 by his sixth, ''Demon Dentist''. relating the tale of a young boy named Alfie with no family except his dad whose world goes upside-down when a new dentist arrives in town. The book won the top prize in the Younger Readers category at the 2015 [[Red House Children's Book Award]]s.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;Siobhan Palmer, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bookprizes/11420104/David-Walliams-wins-prize-at-Red-House-Childrens-Book-Awards-2015.html David Walliams wins prize at Red House Children’s Book Awards 2015] The Daily Telegraph, 21 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

This was the story of a girl named Stella whose Auntie has moved into her house with her owl, Wagner. It is the first (and currently only) of Walliams' books to not include Raj the newsagent.

In 2015, Walliams backs children's fairytales app GivingTales in aid of UNICEF together with [[Roger Moore]], [[Stephen Fry]], [[Ewan McGregor]], [[Joan Collins]], [[Joanna Lumley]], [[Michael Caine]], [[Charlotte Rampling]] and [[Paul McKenna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Roger Moore backs children's fairytales app in aid of Unicef|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jun/18/roger-moore-childrens-app-unicef-givingtales|work=The Guardian|date=18 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Screenwriting===
In addition to his writing credits for his Sketch Shows and adaptions of his novels, it was announced in November 2015 that he would be co-writing an animated feature with filmmaker [[Edgar Wright]] for [[DreamWorks Animation]]. In July 2016, it was announced that it would be titled ''Shadows'' and be released in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/movies/shrek-forever/shrek-5-edgar-wright-shadows-arrive-2019/|title=Shrek 5 and Edgar Wright's Shadows on track to arrive in 2019|first=James|last=White|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and honours==
Walliams was given a special award in recognition of his sporting efforts for charity. [[Matt Lucas (comedian)|Matt Lucas]] produced a documentary on the subject, entitled ''Little Britain's Big Swim''.

Although initially tipped as a contender for the BBC's Sports Personality of the Year poll for 2006, Walliams failed to make the final shortlist of 10 contenders. Walliams was given a special award during the ceremony for his achievement. In July 2006, he became Patron of 'Cardiac Risk in the Young'.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

In September 2011 Walliams won the Lincolnshire Young People's Book Award in the 9-11-year-old category with his book, [[Mr Stink]]. The award is voted for by the school children of [[Lincolnshire]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

==Sport Relief==
{{main article|Sport Relief}}

===Telethon hosting===
Walliams co-hosted a segment of the [[Sport Relief]] telethon in [[Sport Relief 2012|2012]], co-hosting the 22:00–22:40 slot with [[Miranda Hart]] when the show moved over to [[BBC Two]] while the [[BBC News at Ten]] was aired.

Walliams also co-hosted the [[Sport Relief 2014|2014]] [[Sport Relief]] telethon. This time, he hosted the earlier slot between 19:00–22:00 with [[Gary Lineker]] and later [[Davina McCall]].

===Swimming the English Channel===
On 4 July 2006 Walliams swam the [[English Channel]] for [[Sport Relief]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tv_and_radio/sport_relief/5143966.stm |title=BBC SPORT Watch Walliams' Channel swim |publisher=BBC News |date=4 July 2006|accessdate=6 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-2255100,00.html |title = Little Britain star swims the Channel |newspaper = The Times |location = London |date = 4 July 2006 |first =Philippe |last = Naughton }}&lt;/ref&gt; It took him 10 hours and 34 minutes to swim the 22-mile (35&amp;nbsp;km) stretch of sea, equivalent to 700 lengths of an [[Olympic-size swimming pool]]. This was wrongly reported as one of the top 50 recorded times for an unaided Channel crossing; in reality Walliams placed 167th at the time of crossing in only the CSA listings, excluding the CSPF listings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channelswimmingassociation.com/ |title=Channel Swimming Association Ltd |publisher=Channelswimmingassociation.com |accessdate=6 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He raised over [[pound sterling|£]]1&amp;nbsp;million in donations. Under the supervision of his trainer, he trained for nine months to prepare for the swim.&lt;ref name="DIDiscs DW"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Desert Island Discs with David Walliams |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/factual/desertislanddiscs_20090222.shtml |series=Desert Island Discs |serieslink=Desert Island Discs |station=[[BBC Radio 4]] |airdate=27 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The training had to coincide with Walliams and Lucas's ''[[Little Britain Live]]'' [[Concert tour|tour]], so he daily had to train for several hours before performing on stage in the evening. Walliams first swam from [[Lee-on-the-Solent]] near [[Portsmouth]] to the [[Isle of Wight]] in around two hours and also completed an eight-hour swim off the coast of [[Croatia]] before embarking on the cross-Channel attempt. Walliams has insisted that prior to his challenge he had never seriously taken part in any sport. [[The Bluetones]]' lead singer [[Mark Morriss]] wrote a song, "Fade In/Fade Out", in honour of Walliams' achievement; it can be found on their [[The Bluetones (album)|self-titled album]], released on 9 October 2006.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}.

===Swimming the Strait of Gibraltar===
On 7 March 2008 Walliams, along with [[James Cracknell]], swam the {{convert|12|mi|km}} [[Strait of Gibraltar]] from Spain to [[Morocco]], again for Sport Relief. He successfully completed the swim in just over 4½ hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tv_and_radio/sport_relief/7282858.stm |title=BBC SPORT – Walliams completes swim to Africa |publisher=BBC News |date=7 March 2008|accessdate=6 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cycling===
In March 2010 Walliams and a group of celebrities cycled an end-to-end journey through the UK, raising over £1&amp;nbsp;million for Sport Relief. Walliams suffered a serious fall when tackling the [[Kirkstone Pass]], a thousand-foot climb in the [[Lake District]] but was able to complete the ride.&lt;ref name="bbc_million_pound"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/sportrelief/news/040310_walliams.shtml |title = Sport Relief – Million Pound Bike Ride |accessdate = 20 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''24 Hour Panel People''===
In March 2011 Walliams undertook ''24 Hour Panel People'', in which he took part in back to back recordings of various panel show formats over the course of 24 hours to raise money for [[Comic Relief]]. The recordings were streamed live on the BBC website. He took part in 19 episodes of "classic" TV panel shows.

===Swimming the Thames===
From 5 to 12 September 2011 Walliams swam the length of the [[River Thames]] (140 miles) and raised more than £2m for [[Sport Relief]]. In the process, he saved a dog from drowning in the river. Once he had got out of the river Walliams said "I think a bath is the only water I will be seeing for a while."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-14712941 |title=BBC News – David Walliams takes on Sport Relief Thames swim challenge |publisher=BBC |date=30 August 2011 |accessdate=6 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.littlebritainfans.com/thames_swim.htm |title=Walliams vs The Thames: David Walliams' 140 mile River Thames Sport Relief Swim |publisher=Littlebritainfans.com |accessdate=6 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120104051140/http://www.littlebritainfans.com/thames_swim.htm |archivedate=4 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sky.com/home/showbiz-news/article/16067916 |title=David Walliams Completes 140-Mile River Thames Swim Challenge For Sport Relief Charity |publisher=Sky News |accessdate=6 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125060757/http://news.sky.com/home/showbiz-news/article/16067916 |archivedate=25 January 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The swim resulted in him getting [[giardiasis]] and injuring a [[intervertebral disc]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2012-03-08/david-walliams-on-his-big-swim-for-sport-relief |title=David Walliams on his Big Swim for Sport Relief |publisher=Radio Times |accessdate=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2013, Walliams had emergency back surgery to alleviate issues caused by the swim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/david-walliams-cancels-rest-2012-2855204 |title=David Walliams cancels rest of 2012 schedule to have back surgery |publisher=Daily Mirror |accessdate=27 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Walliams hinted at being [[pansexual]] in the book ''Inside Little Britain'', but said he did not like to be labelled by that word. In an interview with ''[[Radio Times]]'' in 2013, he stated: "I think it's all about falling in love with the person and that is overlooked, really. I hate it when people 'confess' or 'reveal' their sexuality and also things can change for people over the years. So it is about the person but I also think it goes beyond that. You don't just fall in love with someone's body, do you? You fall in love with someone's soul and heart and brain."&lt;ref name="Radiotimes_sexuality"&gt;{{Cite news |title = David Walliams – a schoolboy misfit who was nicknamed Cuthbert |url = http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2013-08-05/david-walliams---a-schoolboy-misfit-who-was-nicknamed-cuthbert |work = [[Radio Times]] |location = London |last= Dowell |first = Ben |date = 5 August 2013 |accessdate = 5 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
