==Early life==
DeVine was born in [[Waterloo, Iowa]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wcfcourier.com/entertainment/waterloo-native-becomes-a-workaholic/article_6a50362c-45ec-11e1-8f4f-0019bb2963f4.html|title=Waterloo Native Becomes a 'Workaholic'|first=Amie|last=Steffen|date=January 23, 2012|work=Waterloo Cedar Falls Courier|accessdate=September 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the son of Dennis and Penny DeVine.&lt;ref name="Omaha"/&gt; He graduated from [[Millard South High School]] in [[Omaha, Nebraska]], in 2002.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

He attended [[Orange Coast College]], along with friend and fellow cast member [[Blake Anderson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gt9VaUl_G8E|title=Adam DeVine on YouTube|publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=December 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later moved to [[Los Angeles]], where he began working as a stand up comedian and actor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationallampoon.com/lemmings/bio_adam.html|title=National Lampoon Lemmings Comedy Troupe!|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111220040931/http://www.nationallampoon.com/lemmings/bio_adam.html|archivedate=December 20, 2011|publisher=National Lampoon|accessdate=July 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="moc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mailordercomedy.com/bios.html|title=Bios|publisher=Mail Order Comedy|date=April 6, 2011|accessdate=July 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1995 accident===
In June 1995, when he was 11 years old, DeVine was walking his bike across a street in Omaha, Nebraska. After he waited for three cement trucks to pass, a fourth truck, previously blocked by opposing traffic, struck him. DeVine went under the first two wheels of the 42 ton cement truck and slid 500 feet. He was knocked unconscious, went into [[acute shock]] and was in a [[coma]]. He was rushed to [[intensive care]], where he woke up two weeks later. He broke all the bones in both legs, had a [[collapsed lung]], developed multiple infections, and it was unknown whether he would ever walk again. Over several years, he had 26 surgeries and spent much of the time using a wheelchair. Due to the extent of his injuries, DeVine was at very high risk of having to have his legs amputated, and having [[multiple organ failure]]. He regained full mobility but still has extensive scarring on his legs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/celebrities/adam-devine/bio/324819|title=Adam DeVine Biography|work=[[TV Guide]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115183122/http://www.tvguide.com/celebrities/adam-devine/bio/324819|archivedate=January 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://ew.com/article/2016/07/08/adam-devine-origin-story-getting-hit-cement-truck/|title= Adam Devine's origin story|work= EW}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"It was really tough because I had to relearn how to walk, stand up, sit up and everything," DeVine described. "The legs were totally mangled. I think that experience helped me realize that anything is possible."&lt;ref name="ketv.com"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ketv.com/article/adam-devine-visits-unl-to-promote-new-movie-1/7659841|title= Adam Devine visits UNL to promote new movie}}&lt;/ref&gt; To pass the time DeVine called into his local radio station and impersonated celebrities to entertain himself and others. Upon returning to school, DeVine experienced bullying, but told jokes as a way to deflect attention away from his injuries. All this, he said, contributed to how he saw comedy as a way of bringing people together. It was later discovered that the reason he was not killed was because his bike was on his right side, and thus took the full force of the truck.&lt;ref name="ketv.com"/&gt;

==Career==
In 2006, DeVine and friends [[Blake Anderson]], [[Anders Holm]], and [[Kyle Newacheck]] formed the sketch-comedy group Mail Order Comedy. Although they toured together live, the group found greater success on websites such as [[Myspace]] and [[YouTube]]. The [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4]] series ''[[Attack of the Show!]]'' featured "Wizards Never Die", a music video by Mail Order Comedy (as The Wizards), in April 2008.&lt;ref name="moc"/&gt; ''Purple Magic'', a music album by The Wizards containing 14 tracks, was released on April 1, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003ESSTAS|title=Purple Magic [Explicit]|publisher=[[Amazon.com]]|asin=B003ESSTAS}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Comedy Central]]'s original series ''[[Workaholics]]'' premiered on April 6, 2011, and stars DeVine, Anderson, and Holm and co-stars Newacheck, all of whom also serve as series creators and executive producers.

DeVine had small roles in ''[[Mama's Boy]]'' (2007) and ''[[National Lampoon's 301: The Legend of Awesomest Maximus]]'' (2009). He had a recurring role on the television series ''[[Samantha Who?]]''. He also appeared on an episode of the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] show ''[[Traffic Light (TV series)|Traffic Light]]'' (2011). In season 4 of ''[[Community (TV series)|Community]]'' (2013), he played a small role as William Winger, Jr., Jeff's half-brother. In the first episode of ''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]]''{{'s}} fourth season, he played an airport ticket attendant alongside his ''Workaholics'' co-stars. He co-starred as Bumper Allen in the 2012 musical comedy film ''[[Pitch Perfect]]''. For this performance, he won a [[Teen Choice Award]] for [[Teen Choice Award for Best Villain|Choice Movie Villain]] and earned one nomination for Choice Movie Breakout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2013/08/11/teen-choice-2013-winners-announced/196915 |title='Teen Choice 2013' Winners Announced |work=[[TV by the Numbers]] |publisher=[[Zap2it]] |first=Robert |last=Seidman |date=August 11, 2013 |accessdate=September 30, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130915010049/http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2013/08/11/teen-choice-2013-winners-announced/196915/ |archivedate=September 15, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2013/07/01/second-wave-of-nominations-heat-up-teen-choice-2013-airing-sunday-august-11-on-fox/189805/ |title=Second Wave of Nominations Heat Up 'Teen Choice 2013' |work=[[TV by the Numbers]] |publisher=[[Zap2it]] |first=Amanda |last=Kondolojy |date=July 1, 2013 |accessdate=September 30, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016163428/http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2013/07/01/second-wave-of-nominations-heat-up-teen-choice-2013-airing-sunday-august-11-on-fox/189805/ |archivedate=October 16, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He reprised the role of Bumper in the film's sequel ''[[Pitch Perfect 2]]'' (2015).

==Personal Life==

DeVine is a big supporter of [[Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals]], a not-for-profit organisation that raises funds for children’s hospitals across America.
