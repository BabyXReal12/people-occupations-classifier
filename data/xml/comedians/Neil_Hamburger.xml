[[File:Neil Hamburger.jpg|thumb|right|alt=|Neil Hamburger in [[Portland, Oregon]]]]
'''Neil Hamburger''' is a [[standup comedy|standup comedian]] character played by comedian and musician [[Gregg Turkington]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Brian |last=Logan |work=[[The Guardian]] |title=Neil Hamburger: Assembly Rooms, Edinburgh |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2010/aug/20/neil-hamburger-edinburgh-review |date=20 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style==
Hamburger's live act, which is quite different from his many albums, features a barrage of question/answer jokes aimed often at celebrity targets as well as barbs aimed at his ex-wife.  He has performed in front of audiences worldwide from [[Madison Square Garden]] to ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'' and the confrontational aspects of his act have drawn comparisons to [[Tony Clifton]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hour.ca/stage/stage.aspx?iIDArticle=7305]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208221054/http://www.hour.ca/stage/stage.aspx?iIDArticle=7305 |date=December 8, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of his most famous gags is the "Zipper Lips", in which he asks an audience member a question. If the audience member doesn't respond, Hamburger derides them for being a "zipper lips". A common phrase used by the comedian is "But that's my life!", which he uses when he mentions being humiliated or degraded for some reason.

==Career==
His first full-length album, ''[[America's Funnyman]]'', was released in 1996. He has released a number of albums on the [[Drag City (record label)|Drag City]] record label.

Hamburger is a frequent guest on the internet talk show ''[[Tom Green's House Tonight]]''. In 2006, Hamburger started doing his own show called ''[[Poolside Chats|Poolside Chats with Neil Hamburger]]'' on ''The Channel'' at Tomgreen.com. Guests on his show have included [[Tim and Eric]], [[Kyle Gass]] of [[Tenacious D]], [[Buzz Osborne]] of [[The Melvins]], and [[Bonnie 'Prince' Billy]].

Hamburger also appeared in a series of three video advertisements promoting the release of the 2006 album by [[Drag City (record label)|Drag City]] stablemate, [[Will Oldham|Bonnie 'Prince' Billy]], ''[[The Letting Go]]''.

In 2007, Hamburger opened for Tenacious D during their ''[[Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny|Pick of Destiny]]'' Tour. In the movie ''The Pick of Destiny'', he made a brief [[cameo appearance]] before Tenacious D came on stage to perform. He has already performed at Madison Square Garden, a show that the ''New York Times'' referred to as likely "the greatest night of his career."{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}  However, his performance was poorly received elsewhere, with booing and heckling ensuing in countries such as Ireland and England. Critics say this was as a result of the crowd being eager to see Sam O'Donovan, who was originally booked but cancelled.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

[[File:Tom Green, Thora Birch and Neil Hamburger.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tom Green]], [[Thora Birch]], and Hamburger in 2006.]]
The Australian [[punk rock|punk]] band [[Frenzal Rhomb]] have used Hamburger to open their sets and appear in their video clips for their songs "Punisher" and "Ballchef", and Frenzal Rhomb members [[Jay and the Doctor]] have called him live on air on their radio show on the network [[Triple J]] to report on current events in America such as award ceremonies.

In 2007, Hamburger appeared in the music video for "Conspiracy of the Gods" by the band [[Trans Am (band)|Trans Am]].

In September 2007 and 2010, he appeared at the Global ComedyFest in Vancouver, Canada. In 2010, he appeared at [[Just For Laughs]] in Montreal, and later that summer, at the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] resulting in rave reviews in ''[[The Scotsman]]'' and ''[[The Guardian]]''.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} That same year, [[Amoeba Records]]' internet series "What's In My Bag?" featured Neil Hamburger as the subject of an episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-sA1-m_Ymg|title=Neil Hamburger - What's In My Bag? (2010)|publisher=Amoeba Records, Youtube|accessdate=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In spring of 2008, [[Drag City (record label)|Drag City]] released an album of country and western originals and covers recorded by Neil Hamburger in a "celebrity vocals" style. During the sessions, Hamburger was backed by musicians including [[Prairie Prince]] of [[The Tubes]] and [[Todd Rundgren]]'s band, David Gleason, [[Atom Ellis]] of [[Dieselhed]] and [[The New Cars]], [[Rachel Haden]] from [[that dog.]]

He also recorded a record doing guest lead vocals with Australian band [[The Hard-Ons]] while in Sydney in January, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Hard-Ons-With-Neil-Hamburger-American-Exports/release/1752069 |title=Hard-Ons With Neil Hamburger - American Exports (Vinyl) at Discogs |publisher=Discogs.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2010, [[Special Entertainment]] released an iPhone App called ''Shaky Advice from Neil Hamburger'' that functions much like a [[Magic 8 Ball]], with 30 video clips of Hamburger giving comical advice.

The Neil Hamburger character plays the role of [[Characters in Hamlet#Osric|Osric]] in the 2014 film, ''[[Hamlet A.D.D.]]'', a live action and animated version of [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0892062/|title=Hamlet A.D.D. (2014)|publisher=IMDb.com|accessdate=2014-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the Neil Hamburger act was dramatized for a [[Rick Alverson]] film titled ''[[Entertainment (2015 film)|Entertainment]]''. In it, the character is shown repeatedly on and offstage; as well as the life of a fictional portrayal of the man behind the act separate from the real Gregg Turkington. The film's script was written by Turkington, Alverson, and comedian [[Tim Heidecker]]; but all dialogue was improvised.
