Hughes was an active member of Australia's early [[black metal]] scene.

==Music career==
Born in Sydney,&lt;ref name=TNTMAG1/&gt; Hughes became interested in heavy metal in the early 80s.&lt;ref name=MUSICRADAR/&gt; In an interview with [[MusicRadar]] Hughes said he became obsessed with [[Iron Maiden]] in 1982 and "the pounding drumming of Mr [[Clive Burr]]" and was also heavily influenced by [[Black Sabbath]] and [[Dio (band)|Dio]] drummer [[Vinnie Appice]], particularly his work on Dio's first 2 albums, which he would repeatedly play while attempting to play along.&lt;ref name=MUSICRADAR/&gt;

In 1985 he founded a band that was originally named Onslaught, but the band was forced to change their name due to a [[Onslaught (band)|UK-based band by the same name]].&lt;ref name=ENCYCLOPEDIA/&gt; The band briefly changed their name to Devastator, before settling on Slaughter Lord.&lt;ref name=ENCYCLOPEDIA/&gt; Slaughter Lord released one demo tape titled ''Taste of Blood'' before disbanding in 1987.&lt;ref name=SUBGENRES/&gt; In spite of the band's short lifespan, Slaughter Lord had received attention overseas&lt;ref name=SUBGENRES/&gt; and has since been called "legendary"&lt;ref name=ENCYCLOPEDIA/&gt; and "pioneering"&lt;ref name=CURRENCY/&gt; in terms of Australia's extreme metal history.

In 1989{{citation needed|reason=Need confirmation of date|date=February 2016}} Hughes joined [[Mortal Sin (band)|Mortal Sin]]&lt;ref name=ROLLINGSTONE/&gt;&lt;ref name=METALOB/&gt; While he did not appear on any of the band's albums, he played drums for them during their European/American tour in 1990.&lt;ref name=DARKSIDE&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.voicesfromthedarkside.de/Interviews/SLAUGHTER-LORD--7110.html |title=Voices from the Darkside |last=Stöver |first=Frank |website=Voices from the Darkside |access-date=11 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his work with Mortal Sin, Hughes formed a rock band called Presto, releasing 2 CDs.&lt;ref name=DARKSIDE/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metalcorefanzine.com/slaughterlord.html |title=Slaughter Lord (Interview with Steve Hughes) |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=Metalcore Fanzine |access-date=11 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Giffin |first=Brian |date=2009 |title=Encyclopedia of Australian Heavy Metal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QK3JCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA2197 |publisher=Lulu.com |page=2197 |isbn=9781409263982 |access-date=11 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; he joined the [[black metal]] band [[Nazxul]].&lt;ref name=ROLLINGSTONE/&gt;&lt;ref name=CHORTLE2/&gt;&lt;ref name=ENCYCLOPEDIA2&gt;{{cite book |last=Giffin |first=Brian |date=2009 |title=Encyclopedia of Australian Heavy Metal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QK3JCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA2197 |publisher=Lulu.com |page=2197 |isbn=9781409263982 |access-date=11 February 2016 |quote="(Nazxul) played their first ever gigs in 1998...Hughes lef the band after these show and in early 1999 was replaced by Front End Loader drummer Pete Kostic."}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|date=December 2017}}&lt;ref name=FEMALE&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.femalefirst.co.uk/celebrity_interviews/steve-hughes-exclusive-interview-363867.html |title=Steve Hughes Exclusive Interview |last=Falconer |first=Daniel |date=31 October 2013 |website=Female First |location=United Kingdom |access-date=11 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also played live with the band [[Primordial (band)|Primordial]] while living in Ireland in 1999.&lt;ref name=FEMALE/&gt;&lt;ref name=BRISTOLPOST/&gt;

In 2010 Hughes released the album ''Sumaire'' [[Independent music|independently]] under the band name Eternum.&lt;ref name=LOWDOWN/&gt;  ''Sumaire'' contained songs that he had written and arranged and mainly performed himself along with "some shredding solos performed by a variety of metal maniacs."&lt;ref name=LOWDOWN/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stvehughes.fourfour.com/news/post/debut-eternum-album Debut Eternum album – Mar 8, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

While Hughes has focused on his comedy career since the early 2000s, he said in a 2010 interview with ''Post Modern Ink'' magazine that music remained his first love.&lt;ref name=POSTMODERN/&gt;

==Comedy career==
Hughes first tried comedy in 1994, shortly after having joined the band Nazxul,&lt;ref name=CHORTLE2/&gt;&lt;ref name="FEMALE"/&gt; and
started performing at The Comedy Store in Sydney.&lt;ref name=METALOB/&gt;&lt;ref name=LOWDOWN&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thelowdownmagazine.com/STEVEN_HUGHES-3523.html |title=Master of Disaster |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |year=2012 |publisher=thelowdownmagazine.com |location=Liverpool, England |access-date=11 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hughes quit Nazxul and left Australia for Ireland in 1999,&lt;ref name=FEMALE/&gt; living for a time with members of the band [[Primordial (band)|Primordial]],&lt;ref name=LOUDMAG&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Fischer-Giffin |first=Brian |date=1 April 2011 |title=Steve Hughes: Bringing the Laughter Home |url=http://www.loudmag.com.au/content/steve-hughes-bringing-the-laughter-home |magazine=Loud Magazine |location=Australia |access-date=11 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; then moved on to London, then on to [[Manchester]] where he stayed in a house with fellow Aussie comic [[Jim Jefferies (comedian)|Jim Jefferies]]&lt;ref name=TNTMAG1/&gt;&lt;ref name=BRISTOLPOST&gt;{{cite news |last=Hale |first=Natalie |date=2 February 2012 |title=Anarchic fun from Aussie rocker Steve Hughes |url=http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/Anarchic-fun-Aussie-rocker-Steve-Hughes/story-15106343-detail/story.html |newspaper=The Bristol Post |access-date=11 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TNTMAG2&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Morton |first=Alasdair |date=30 January 2012 |title=Interview: Steve Hughes on heavy metal, weed and laughing from your balls| url=http://www.tntmagazine.com/entertainment/interviews/interview-steve-hughes-on-heavy-metal-weed-and-laughing-from-your-balls |magazine=TNT Magazine |location=United Kingdom  |access-date=11 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; before finally settling in [[Manchester]] in 2002.&lt;ref name=ROLLINGSTONE/&gt;&lt;ref name=METALOB/&gt;&lt;ref name=TNTMAG1/&gt;

Hughes' early comedy was influenced by [[Bill Cosby]] and the works of [[Woody Allen]], particularly his books ''[[Side Effects (Allen book)|Side Effects]]'' and ''[[Without Feathers]]'' as well as a 1965 recording of one of Allen's stand-up shows that Hughes had owned on [[audio cassette]].&lt;ref name=CHORTLE2/&gt;&lt;ref name=POSTMODERN/&gt;&lt;ref name=HULL&gt;{{cite news |last=Creighton |first=Sam |date=29 October 2013 |title=Steve Hughes at Hull Comedy Festival: 'The end of the world has brought me new fans' |url=http://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/Steve-Hughes-Hull-Comedy-Festival-end-world/story-20001058-detail/story.html |newspaper=Hull Daily Mail |location=United Kingdom |access-date=11 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hughes has also cited having been influenced by the comedy of [[Richard Pryor]], [[Dave Allen (comedian)|Dave Allen]], [[George Carlin]] and [[Eddie Murphy]].&lt;ref name=CHORTLE2/&gt;&lt;ref name=POSTMODERN/&gt; Hughes comedic style has also been influenced by the political and subversive humor of [[Bill Hicks]], as well as the [[spoken word]] performances of musicians [[Henry Rollins]] and [[Jello Biafra]].&lt;ref name=CHORTLE2/&gt;&lt;ref name=TNTMAG2/&gt;

After touring non-stop for four years and averaging more than 150 shows a year, Hughes took a break for health reasons.&lt;ref name=PERTHNOW/&gt; During this hiatus he quit both drugs and alcohol [[cold turkey]] and cut his long hair short.&lt;ref name=PERTHNOW/&gt;&lt;ref name=HERALDSUN2/&gt; He returned to the comedy stage in 2014.&lt;ref name=PERTHNOW/&gt;

==Television and film==

Hughes was interviewed for the 2014 documentary film ''Metal Down Under: A History Of Australian Heavy Metal''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/metal-down-under-a-history-of-australian-heavy-metal-dvd-now-available/ |title='Metal Down Under': A History of Australian Heavy Metal DVD Now Available |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=21 August 2014 |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |access-date=11 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metaldownunder.com/ Official website of ''Metal Down Under'']&lt;/ref&gt;
