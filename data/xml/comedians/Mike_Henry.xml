==Early life==
Henry and his younger brother Patrick were born to artist parents and raised in [[Richmond, Virginia]]. His parents divorced when he was six years old and he was primarily raised by his mother. Although money was tight, he was awarded a scholarship and attended the nearby preparatory [[Collegiate School (Richmond, Virginia)|Collegiate School]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/30/arts/television/30itzk.html|title=With 'The Cleveland Show,' Mike Henry Spins Off Into Uncharted Cartoon Territory|last=Itzkoff|first=Dave|date=2009-08-27|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-05-01|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henry graduated from [[Washington and Lee University]] (1988) where he earned his B.A. in history and served as class president his sophomore-senior years. Although interested in comedy, Mike never believed he could make a career of it so instead opted for more “business stuff.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://panthernow.com/2014/10/24/family-guy-voice-actor-visits-university/|title='Family Guy' voice actor visits University - PantherNOW|date=2014-10-24|work=PantherNOW|access-date=2018-05-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of 24, after a brief career in advertising, Henry moved to [[California]] to pursue acting. There he began taking classes at the [http://www.groundlings.com/ Groundlings Theater] and performing stand-up comedy.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.backstage.com/interview/playing-in-cleveland/|title=Playing in 'Cleveland'|work=Backstage.com|access-date=2018-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; After three years in LA, Mike returned to Virginia to shoot short comedy films that he wrote and acted in.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.styleweekly.com/richmond/welcome-back-cleveland/Content?oid=1377329|title=Welcome Back, Cleveland|website=Style Weekly|language=en|access-date=2018-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; During that time, Mike often acted in his brother Patrick’s student films at the [[Rhode Island School of Design]]. It was there that he was introduced to his brother’s college roommate, [[Seth MacFarlane]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The two quickly became friends. "We immediately hit it off and cracked each other up and kept in touch," Henry says.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Henry later moved to [[New York City]] where he acted in commercials, studied improvisation at the [[Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre|Upright Citizens Brigade Theater]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/person/mike-henry-vi?filter-options=tv|title=Mike Henry (VI)|website=Metacritic|access-date=2018-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote, produced, starred-in and co-directed (with his brother Patrick) comedy shorts for [[Lorne Michaels|Lorne Michaels’]] [[Burly Bear Network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.styleweekly.com/richmond/voice-of-the-people/Content?oid=1367039|title=Voice of the People|last=Burruss|first=Mary|website=Style Weekly|language=en|access-date=2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===''Family Guy''===
Henry’s break came in 1998, when MacFarlane contacted him about being part of a new show called ''Family Guy.'' Mike agreed and joined the project as a writer and voice actor. Henry has stated that the inspiration for Cleveland's voice was based on “this guy that [he] had once played basketball with.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRBOx3f_ZRs|title=Mike Henry: The Origins of Cleveland and Herbert|accessdate=2009-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the show's first four seasons, he was credited as a guest star, but beginning with [[Family Guy (season 5)|season five]]'s "[[Prick Up Your Ears (Family Guy)|Prick Up Your Ears]]" he has been credited as a main cast member.&lt;ref name="Henry"&gt;{{cite news|title=Mike Henry of "Family Guy" talks voices, gags and instinct |date=September 11, 2008 |work=[[Campus Times]] |url=http://www.campustimes.org/mike-henry-of-family-guy-talks-voices-gags-and-instinct-1.743902 |accessdate=September 8, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091016192410/http://www.campustimes.org/mike-henry-of-family-guy-talks-voices-gags-and-instinct-1.743902 |archivedate=October 16, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its debut on January 31, 1999, [[List of Family Guy episodes|306 episodes]] of ''Family Guy'' have been broadcast with Mike having credits in nearly all of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1396611/|title=Mike Henry|website=IMDb|access-date=2018-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Two episodes into the second season, ''Family Guy'' was taken off the network's permanent schedule and shown irregularly thereafter. The show returned in March 2000 to finish airing the second season which contained 21 episodes; all the cast came back for the series return. During its second season, Fox publicly announced that the show had been cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archive.boston.com/ae/tv/articles/2005/04/30/family_guy_returns_just_as_funny_as_ever/|title=''Family Guy'' Returns, Just As Funny As Ever|last=Gilbert|first=Matthew|date=April 30, 2005|work=Boston.com|accessdate=August 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the announced cancellation, in 2003 Fox decided to make the third season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2003-11-18-family-guy_x.htm|title=''Family Guy'' may return|last1=Levin|first1=Gary|date=November 18, 2003|work=USAtoday.com|accessdate=September 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the third season, Fox announced that the show was canceled for good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://familyguy.tktv.net/news.html |title=Family Guy has finally been officially canceled by Fox |work=TKtv |date=May 16, 2002 |accessdate=August 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT McKinley"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A03E3D61E31F931A35756C0A9639C8B63 |title=Canceled and Resurrected, on the Air and Onstage |work=[[The New York Times]] |first=Jesse |last=McKinley |date=May 2, 2005 |accessdate=August 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after ''Family Guy'' was cancelled, Henry and his brother created the popular web series ''[[Kicked in the Nuts]]'', a spoof of hidden camera shows. ''Family Guy'' was renewed again in 2005 for its fourth season due to strong DVD sales and its [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] on basic cable networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/apr/13/business/fi-family13|title=Fox Reuniting Itself with ''Family Guy''|last=James|first=Meg|date=April 13, 2005|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=September 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Yet another ''Family'' reunion |newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times |first=Phil |last=Rosenthal |page=53 |date=November 20, 2003 |accessdate=September 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once again Henry and the rest of the cast came back for their voice works. In October 2017, Family Guy was renewed for its 16th season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://heavy.com/entertainment/2017/05/family-guy-renewed-cancelled-will-return-season-16-2017-spoilers/|title=‘Family Guy’ Renewed or Cancelled: Is it Coming Back for Season 16?|last=Levine|first=Daniel S.|date=2017-05-22|work=Heavy.com|access-date=2018-05-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Cleveland Show''===
On September 27th 2009, ''[[The Cleveland Show]]'' premiered on Fox.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?id=20090615fox01|title=FOX Announces Fall Premiere Dates For The 2009–2010 Season|date=June 15, 2009|work=The Futon Critic|accessdate=August 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was created and executive produced by Henry, [[Seth MacFarlane]], and ''[[American Dad!]]'' [[show runner]] [[Rich Appel]].
