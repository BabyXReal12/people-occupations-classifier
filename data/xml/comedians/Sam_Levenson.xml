'''Samuel Levenson''' (December 28, 1911{{spaced ndash}}August 27, 1980) was an [[United States|American]] humorist, writer, teacher, [[television host]], and [[journalist]].

==Personal life==
Born in 1911, he grew up in a large [[Jewish]] immigrant family in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City|New York]]. He graduated from [[Brooklyn College]] in 1934. He married Esther Levine (1910–1999) and had two children, Emily and Conrad, the latter a graduate of [[Columbia University]], an [[architect]], a resident of  [[New York City]], and father of four children.

==Career==
From 1949 to 1954 Levenson was a panelist on the [[CBS]] series ''[[This Is Show Business]]'' along with [[playwright]] [[George S. Kaufman]] and [[Abe Burrows]].&lt;ref&gt;Alex McNeil, ''Total Television'', p. 832&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950 he and fellow comedian [[Joe E. Lewis]] were the first members of the [[New York Friars' Club]] to be [[Roast (comedy)|roast]]ed. The club has roasted a member every year since the inaugural roasting.&lt;ref name=slade&gt;{{cite book|last=Slade|first=Anthony|title=The Encyclopedia of Vaudeville|year=2012|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|isbn=978-1617032493|pages=197–198|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Encyclopedia_of_Vaudeville.html?id=Hu3nNSmRjZ0C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956 he hosted the [[game show]] ''[[Two for the Money (game show)|Two for the Money]]'', having replaced fellow humorist [[Herb Shriner]]. From 1959 to 1964, he hosted ''The Sam Levenson Show''. Over a span of more than a decade, he appeared on ''Toast of the Town'' aka ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' twenty-one times, in addition to frequently serving as a substitute host on CBS's ''[[Arthur Godfrey|Arthur Godfrey Time]]''. He was a guest host on ''[[The Price Is Right (1956 U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]'' and was a panelist on many other television programs such as ''[[Password (TV series)|Password]]'' and ''[[What's My Line?]]'' Levenson also had a [[Cameo appearance|cameo]] in the film ''[[A Face in the Crowd (film)|A Face in the Crowd]]''. Levenson also appeared multiple times on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' through the 1970s. Levenson wrote the well-known poem "Time Tested Beauty Tips" for his grandchild, which has become falsely attributed to [[Audrey Hepburn]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.robinsweb.com/inspiration/beauty_tips.html "Time Tested Beauty Tips" by Sam Levenson]&lt;/ref&gt;

Levenson was originally a [[Spanish language|Spanish]] teacher at [[Samuel J. Tilden High School]] in Brooklyn, New York. He was an author and wrote ''Everything But Money'' (1966), the bestseller ''Sex and the Single Child'' (1969), ''In One Era And Out The Other'' (1973), ''You Can Say That Again, Sam!'' (1975), and ''You Don't Have to be in Who's Who to Know What's What'' (1979). Levenson appeared frequently in the "[[Borscht Belt]]" hotels of the [[Catskill Mountains]].

The 150-seat Sam Levenson Recital Hall at [[Brooklyn College]] was named after him in 1988 in gratitude for his donations over the years to the Performing Arts Center. A glazed porcelain bust of him graces the hall's rear wall. The library of [[Franklin K. Lane High School]], from which he graduated in 1930, is named for him, and a large portrait painting of him hangs on the north wall of the library. During Lane High School's rededication ceremony in the fall of 1976, Levenson was an honored guest and gave a humorous speech about his days as a student.

Levenson died of a [[heart attack]] in [[Long Island College Hospital]] on August 27, 1980. He was 68.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=348&amp;dat=19800828&amp;id=8GUvAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=wjQDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1600,4242110 Rome News-Tribune – August 28, 1980]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of his brothers was the WPA muralist and artist, teacher, and art critic [[Michael Lenson]].
