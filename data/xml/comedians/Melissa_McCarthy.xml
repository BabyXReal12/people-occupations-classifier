==Personal life==
McCarthy married her longtime boyfriend, [[Ben Falcone]], an actor and alumnus of [[The Groundlings]], on October 8, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gilmorenews.com/2005/10/22/melissa-mccarthy-gets-married/|author=Arieanna|title=Melissa McCarthy gets married!!|publisher=Gilmore News|date=22 October 2005|accessdate=30 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.groundlings.com/performers/performer-details.aspx?performerID=122|title=Ben Falcone|year=2011|accessdate=30 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple have two daughters, Vivian (born May 2007) and Georgette "Georgie" (born March 2010). McCarthy's pregnancy with Vivian was written into the last season of ''Gilmore Girls''. Their daughter Vivian played the younger version of her mother's character in the 2016 movie ''[[The Boss (2016 film)|The Boss]]''.

Falcone often makes cameo appearances in movies and television shows starring McCarthy, such as a third-season episode of ''Gilmore Girls'', ''Bridesmaids'', ''The Heat'', ''Tammy'', ''Identity Thief'', ''Spy'', and ''The Boss.''

Since the start of the ''Mike &amp; Molly'' series, McCarthy has lost an estimated {{convert|75|lbs|round=5|abbr=on}}. She credits the weight loss to a high-protein, low-carbohydrate diet, regular exercise, and a "super-boring life" that includes a 7:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. bedtime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hollywoodlife.com/2016/04/06/melissa-mccarthy-secrets-weight-loss-diet-75-pounds/|title=Melissa McCarthy: The Secret Behind Her Incredible 75lb Weight Loss Revealed|last=Wilson|first=Samantha|publisher=Hollywood Life|date=April 6, 2016|accessdate=May 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film cost $20 million, quite a low budget, and McCarthy, who can command close to $10 million a role, took a smaller upfront salary in exchange for a larger-than-normal cut of the film's proceeds, according to people familiar with the deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://online.wsj.com/articles/melissa-mccarthy-is-hollywoods-unlikely-leading-lady-1403820340|title=Melissa McCarthy Is Hollywood's Unlikely Leading Lady|author=Ben Fritz|date=26 June 2014|work=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=20 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fashion line==
McCarthy, who studied [[Textile]]s at [[Southern Illinois University]], originally was interested in a career in fashion before she pursued a career in acting. When she first moved to New York City, it was to attend the [[Fashion Institute of Technology]]. One of her closest friends is shoe designer Brian Atwood.

Following her films, she teamed up with Sunrise Brands to manufacture her first clothing collection, Melissa McCarthy Seven7, for [[Plus size clothing|plus-size]] women.
