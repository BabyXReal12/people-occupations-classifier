'''Paul Gladney''' (born August 4, 1941), better known by the stage name '''Paul Mooney''', is an American comedian,&lt;ref name="PM"/&gt; writer, [[social criticism|social critic]], and television and film actor. He is best known for his appearances on ''[[Chappelle's Show]]'' and as a writer for comedian [[Richard Pryor]].&lt;ref name="PM"&gt;{{cite web|work=[[PopMatters]]|title=Richard Pryor's Designated Writer: An Interview With Paul Mooney|author=Ryfle, Steve|date=March 26, 2010|url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/feature/121640-richard-pryors-designated-writer-an-interview-with-paul-mooney/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mooney's Memories: 'Black Is The New White'|date=December 8, 2009|author=Conan, Neal|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=121208290|work=[[National Public Radio]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Mooney was born in [[Shreveport, Louisiana]], and moved to [[Oakland, California]], seven years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mooney|first=Paul|title=Black is the New White|year=2009|publisher=Simon Spotlight Entertainment|isbn=978-1-4165-8795-8|pages=36, 44}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents are George Gladney and LaVoya Ealy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mooney|first=Paul|title=Black is the New White|year=2009|publisher=Simon Spotlight Entertainment|isbn=978-1-4165-8795-8|pages=49|quote=I see LaVoya, my real mother, more than I ever did in Shreveport. My father George Gladney stayed in Shreveport and faded out of my life,}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mooney was raised primarily by his grandmother Aimay Ealy, known among the family as "Mama".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mooney|first=Paul|title=Black is the New White|year=2009|publisher=Simon Spotlight Entertainment|isbn=978-1-4165-8795-8|pages=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mama coined the nickname "Mooney" after the original [[Scarface (1932 film)|''Scarface'']] (1932) actor [[Paul Muni]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mooney|first=Paul|title=Black is the New White|year=2009|publisher=Simon Spotlight Entertainment|isbn=978-1-4165-8795-8|pages=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Mooney became a [[ringmaster (circus)|ringmaster]] with the Gatti-Charles Circus. During his stint as ringmaster, he always found himself writing comedy and telling jokes, which later helped Mooney land his first professional work as a writer for Richard Pryor.

Mooney wrote some of Pryor's routines for his appearance on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', co-wrote his material for the ''[[Richard Pryor: Live on the Sunset Strip|Live on the Sunset Strip]]'', ''[[Bicentennial Nigger]]'', and ''[[...Is It Something I Said?|Is It Something I Said]]'' albums, and Pryor's film ''[[Jo Jo Dancer, Your Life Is Calling]]''. As the head writer for ''[[The Richard Pryor Show]]'', he gave many young comics, such as [[Robin Williams]], [[Sandra Bernhard]], [[Marsha Warfield]], [[John Witherspoon (actor)|John Witherspoon]], and [[Tim Reid]], their first break into show business.

Mooney also wrote for [[Redd Foxx]]'s ''[[Sanford and Son]]'' and ''[[Good Times]]'', acted in several cult classics including ''[[Which Way Is Up?]]'', ''[[Bustin' Loose (film)|Bustin' Loose]]'', ''[[Hollywood Shuffle]]'', and portrayed singer/songwriter [[Sam Cooke]] in ''[[The Buddy Holly Story]]''.

He was the head writer for the first year of [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]'s ''[[In Living Color]]'', inspiring the character [[Homey D. Clown]], played by [[Damon Wayans]]. Mooney later went on to play Wayans' father in the [[Spike Lee]] film ''[[Bamboozled]]'' as the comedian Junebug.

Mooney initially appeared in the sketches "Ask a Black Dude" and "Mooney at the Movies" on [[Comedy Central]]'s ''Chappelle's Show''. He later appeared as [[Negrodamus]], an African American version of [[Nostradamus]]. As Negrodamus, Mooney [[Ad lib|ad-libbed]] the "answers to life's most unsolvable mysteries" such as "Why do white people love [[Wayne Brady]]?" (Answer: "Because Wayne Brady makes [[Bryant Gumbel]] look like [[Malcolm X]].") Mooney was planning to reprise his role as Negrodamus in the third season of the ''Chappelle's Show'', before Dave Chappelle left the show due to stress, and it ended suddenly.

In 2006, Paul Mooney hosted the [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]] tribute to [[Black History Month]] titled ''25 Most @#%! Moments in Black History''. In this show, he narrated some of the most shameful incidents involving African Americans since 1980. The top 25 moments included incidents involving [[Marion Barry]], [[Terrell Owens]], [[Wilson Goode]], [[Michael Jackson]], [[Flavor Flav]], [[Whitney Houston]], and [[Tupac Shakur]].

In 2007, Mooney released his first book, the memoir ''[[Black is the New White]]''.&lt;ref name="PM" /&gt;

In November 2014, Paul's brother announced that Mooney has prostate cancer.&lt;ref name=B&gt;{{cite web|work=[[BET]]|title=Paul Mooney Suffering From Prostate Cancer|author=Reeves, Marcus|date=May 20, 2014|url=http://www.bet.com/news/celebrities/2014/05/20/paul-mooney-suffering-from-prostate-cancer.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mooney still continues to tour, performing his stand-up comedy act.&lt;ref name=B/&gt;

==Controversies==
Much of Mooney's material is based on the subject of [[racism in the United States]].&lt;ref name=V&gt;{{cite web|date=February 2, 2016|title=The Curious Decline of Paul Mooney|author=Peisner, David|url=http://www.vulture.com/2016/01/curious-decline-of-paul-mooney.html|publisher=[[New York (magazine)|Vulture.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
===''BET Comedy Awards''===
In September 2005, Mooney performed a segment at the 2005 BET Comedy Awards called the "[[Nigga]] Wake Up Call Award", in which he jokingly presents an award to African American celebrities who have had well-publicized legal troubles. The "nominees" included [[Michael Jackson]], [[Oprah Winfrey]], [[Lil' Kim]], and [[Diana Ross]]. Mooney awarded Ross and made numerous jokes about Ross' 2002 arrest for [[DUI]].&lt;ref name="ross"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mooney|first=Paul|title=Black is the New White|year=2009|publisher=Simon Spotlight Entertainment|isbn=978-1-4165-8795-8|pages=239}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to people who were in attendance, Mooney also made light of the death of Ross' ex-husband [[Arne NÃ¦ss Jr.]], who fell while [[mountain climbing]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theroot.com/articles/culture/2011/06/when_comedians_go_too_far_tracy_morgan_paul_mooney_and_more/|title=So Funny It Hurts? Comedians Who Go Too Far|first=Jacque|last=Reid|date=June 25, 2011|work=[[The Root (magazine)|''The Root'']]|accessdate=2013-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tracee Ellis Ross]], Ross's daughter and NÃ¦ss's stepdaughter, was also in attendance. She reportedly was so offended and embarrassed that she left the room and was comforted by host [[Steve Harvey]].&lt;ref name="EUR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurweb.com/story/eur22573.cfm |title=Comedian Paul Mooney's Outrageous Attack On Diana Ross At BET Awards Taping: A Freaked out, Tracee Ellis Ross, Was in the Audience |publisher=EURweb.com |date=September 26, 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081224214006/http://www.eurweb.com/story/eur22573.cfm |archivedate=December 24, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Backstage in the press room, Mooney was asked if he felt his performance was "over the top". Mooney replied: {{quote|How can somebody get arrested for ([[driving under the influence|being under the influence]]) and go to jail and I be over the top? I think that's over the top, don't you? Agree or disagree, folks. No, comedy is not over the top. When you are a celebrity and you do crazy stuff, that's the game.}}

When Mooney was informed that Tracee Ellis Ross was in the audience, he stated: {{quote|1=I didn't know ... her mama could've been in there, that's not the point. I didn't drive drunk. Now I'm responsible for Diana Ross? If you scrutinize [[Jay Leno]] and [[David Letterman]] the same way you scrutinize me, then I'll agree with you, but if you don't touch them white folks don't touch me. They say whatever they want to say every night.&lt;ref name="EUR"/&gt;}}

The majority of Mooney's performance was edited out of the televised broadcast and not aired.&lt;ref name="ross" /&gt;

===''Showtime at the Apollo''===
During a 2006 performance at the [[Apollo Theater]] in which Mooney was taping a segment for ''[[Showtime at the Apollo]]'', his performance was stopped in the middle of his act, allegedly due to his criticisms of President [[George W. Bush]]. Mooney appeared on ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'' on October 30, 2006, where he talked about the performance, including bringing in his road manager as a witness. During the act, he made several jokes about Bush, including one likening him to [[the devil]] and one stating that [[Barbara Bush|his mother]] looked like the "guy on the [[Quaker Oats]] box",&lt;ref&gt;''The Howard Stern Show'', aired Oct 30, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and was immediately pulled from the stage. A 45-minute debate ensued in his dressing room in which they decided to cancel the rest of his act. Mooney was told that he had "offended unnamed officials from [[Time Warner]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071101084205/http://www.freemarketnews.com/WorldNews.asp?nid=22914|archivedate=November 1, 2007|date=October 6, 2006|website=Freemarketnews.com|url=http://www.freemarketnews.com/WorldNews.asp?nid=22914|title=Is Time Warner Practicing Censorship?|accessdate=January 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; which operates ''Showtime at the Apollo''. A Time Warner spokeswoman called the story "ridiculous... it's absolutely untrue" that the company had anything to do with the incident. Mooney vowed never to perform at the Apollo again until he receives a straight answer.&lt;ref name="Mooney 2009 242â€“243"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mooney|first=Paul|title=Black is the New White|year=2009|publisher=Simon Spotlight Entertainment|isbn=978-1-4165-8795-8|pages=242â€“243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="The N-Word"===
On November 26, 2006, Mooney appeared on [[CNN]] and talked about how he would stop using the word "[[nigga]]" due to [[Michael Richards]]' outbursts on stage at the [[Laugh Factory]].&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;{{cite web|author=Anderson, Brooke|publisher=[[CNN]]|url=http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/blogs/marquee/2006/11/racist-rant-heard-round-world.html|date=November 28, 2006|title=The racist rant heard 'round the world}}&lt;/ref&gt; He referred to Richards as having become "his [[Phil McGraw|Dr. Phil]]" and "cured" him of the use of the epithet. Mooney also said, "We're gonna stop using the n-word. I'm gonna stop using it. I'm not gonna use it again and I'm not gonna use the b-word. And we're gonna put an end to the n-word. Just say no to the n-word. We want all human beings throughout the world to stop using the n-word."{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

On November 30, Mooney elaborated upon these remarks from his appearance on CNN as a guest of [[Farai Chideya]] on the [[National Public Radio]] program ''News &amp; Notes''.&lt;ref name=NPR&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[NPR]]|title=When the 'N' Word Is Part of a Routine|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=6560171|date=November 30, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He declared that he would convene a conference on this controversial subject in the near future, as well as perform his first "n-free" comedy in the upcoming days.&lt;ref name=NPR/&gt;

That show, which he performed at the [[Lincoln Theatre (Washington, D.C.)|Lincoln Theater]] following a set by [[Dick Gregory]], took place on December 2, 2006. Mooney almost made it through his entire setâ€”about an hour of jokesâ€”before he mistakenly used the word in a routine on [[O.J. Simpson]]. He ran off stage covering his face in his hands, and walked back on a few moments later saying, "I'm really going to get it now. This is probably already on the Internet." On the BET special ''25 Events that Mis-Shaped Black America'', Mooney reiterated that he was no longer using the word. He was quoted as saying, "I am no longer going to use the n-word. Instead of saying 'What's up my nigga,' say 'What's up my Michael Richards.'"  At a summit with [[Jesse Jackson]], Reverend [[Al Sharpton]], and Richards, Mooney forgave Richards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mooney|first=Paul|title=Black is the New White|year=2009|publisher=Simon Spotlight Entertainment|isbn=978-1-4165-8795-8|pages=245}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Boston Marathon bombings===
At a performance in West Nyack, New York, on April 20, 2013â€”five days after the [[Boston Marathon bombing]]â€”Mooney allegedly joked, "white people in Boston deserved what they got and (it was) OK to lose a few limbs... as long as no blacks got hurt it was OK."  Numerous audience members stormed out and the show's producer "Levity Live Comedy Club" cancelled the remaining shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Comic Paul Mooney comes under fire for Boston comments at Levity Live show|work=Lohud.com|author=Easley, Hema|date=April 22, 2013|url=http://www.lohud.com/article/20130422/NEWS03/304220135/Comic-Paul-Mooney-comes-under-fire-Boston-comments-Levity-Live-show}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On April 23, Mooney appeared on the ''[[Opie and Anthony Show]]'' on Sirius XM Satellite Radio, and denied he had made the comments as reported, particularly denying he said that "white people deserved to be blown up."
