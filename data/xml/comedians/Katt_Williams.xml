On December 3, 2012, Williams announced the end of his stand-up comedy career, a day after a bizarre incident in [[Seattle, Washington]] that landed him in jail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Katt Williams: 'I'm kinda done' with stand-up comedy career |url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/12/04/showbiz/katt-williams-done-comedy/index.html?eref=rss_mostpopular/ | work=CNN.com | date=December 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, just 3 days later, Williams announced he was coming out of retirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Katt Williams Not Retiring From Stand-Up Comedy, Just Felt Unappreciated |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/06/katt-williams-not-retiring-stand-up-comedy-quitting-unappreciated_n_2251769.html | work=huffingtonpost.com | date=December 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 3, 2015, during an interview, Williams would announce and describe the name of his new upcoming tour entitled "Conspiracy Theory" stating, "The conspiracy conversation is a conversation that we are all familiar with. We know that there are conspiracies out there, but this is a conversation that encompasses a lot of things that aren't being discussed other places. That's the basis for all conspiracy theories: the fact that there is hidden information out there, and how our process changes about things that we thought we used to know. We all, at some point, if we're are at a certain age, we grew up thinking Pluto was a planet. This is probably going to go down as one of my finest works, just because it's a collection of forbidden topics that we can't seem to get answered. I am one of the rare urban public officials. Part of my guarantee in my ticket price is that I'm going to be talking about what we are talking about now, and discussing from now to the next time we see [me] again. This is the open discussion that we've had since 2003. This is what it is about."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/katt-williams-announces-conspiracy-theory-tour-20150903|title=Katt Williams Announces 'Conspiracy Theory' Tour|work=Rolling Stone}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/katt-williams-announces-conspiracy-theory-national-tour-300143031.html|title=Katt Williams Announces Conspiracy Theory National Tour|author=Entertainment Fusion Group|date=15 September 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
