==Film background==
The film ''[[Meri Jung]]'', released in 1985, gave him his first opportunity to enact the role of a villain and showcase his dancing powers on screen.&lt;ref name="Javed Jaffrey: Dance shows are more focussed on the reality part" /&gt;&lt;ref name="'The Forest' shows what we are inside: Javed Jaffrey"&gt;{{cite news|title='The Forest' shows what we are inside: Javed Jaffrey|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/the-forest-shows-what-we-are-inside-javed-jaffrey/257514-8-66.html|accessdate=2 September 2013|newspaper=IBNLive}}&lt;/ref&gt; Television in the 1990s highlighted his comical abilities, extending his popularity further. The launch of cable TV, particularly Channel [V] and its irreverent sense of humour, gave him a niche to depict his unique brand of comedy.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

He anchored the show [[Channel V|Videocon Flashback]] with distinctive brilliance. His deadpan expressions and bilingual puns gave him a formidable fan following.&lt;ref name="Johny come lately"&gt;{{cite news|title=Johny come lately|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/jaaved-jaaferi-the-multi-faceted-maverick-is-in-the-best-run-of-his-life/1/290152.html|accessdate=2 September 2013|newspaper=India Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another notable contribution by Jaffrey is his performance as an anchor to the top-of-the-charts song programme, ''Timex Timepass'', in which he shifted between the caricatures of characters.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

He won his first [[International Indian Film Academy Awards|IIFA Award]] for best comic role in ''[[Salaam Namaste]]'' in 2006. He hosts the dance competition show ''[[Boogie-woogie (TV show)|Boogie Woogie]]'' on Sony Entertainment Television Asia with his brother Naved Jaffery and friend Ravi Behl.&lt;ref name="Javed Jaffrey: Dance shows are more focussed on the reality part"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TV offers opportunities to every talent: Javed Jaffrey"&gt;{{cite news|title=TV offers opportunities to every talent: Javed Jaffrey|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/Entertainment/television/TV-offers-opportunities-to-every-talent-Javed-Jaffrey/Article1-1104182.aspx|accessdate=2 September 2013|newspaper=Hindustan Times|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130817053649/http://www.hindustantimes.com/Entertainment/Television/TV-offers-opportunities-to-every-talent-Javed-Jaffrey/Article1-1104182.aspx|archivedate=17 August 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He recently started hosting a game show called ''Mai Ka Laal'' on Disney Channel India which airs on Sundays at 5pm.

== Political career ==
He has been fielded in 2014 Lok Sabha Elections from [[Lucknow (Lok Sabha constituency)|Lucknow]] on the ticket of [[Aam Aadmi Party]] which he lost to BJP's national president [[Rajnath Singh]]. He had finished 5th in the constituency securing only 41429 votes and lost his deposit.&lt;ref&gt;http://eciresults.nic.in/ConstituencywiseS2435.htm?ac=35&lt;/ref&gt;
