'''Howard Michael Mandel''' (born November 29, 1955) is a Canadian comedian, actor, and television host. He is known as host of the [[NBC]] game show ''[[Deal or No Deal (U.S. game show)|Deal or No Deal]]'', as well as the show's [[Deal or No Deal (U.S. syndicated game show)|daytime]] and [[Deal or No Deal Canada|Canadian-English]] counterparts. In 1987, Mandel starred alongside [[Amy Steel]] in the comedy film ''[[Walk Like a Man (1987 film)|Walk Like a Man]]''. Before his career as a game show host, Mandel was best known for his role as rowdy ER intern Dr. Wayne Fiscus on the NBC medical drama ''[[St. Elsewhere]]''. He is also well known for being the creator and star of the children's cartoon ''[[Bobby's World]]'', as well as a judge on [[NBC]]'s ''[[America's Got Talent]]''.

==Early life==
Mandel was born and lived in the [[Willowdale, Toronto|Willowdale]] area of [[Toronto]], Ontario. Mandel is [[Jewish]] (his ancestors emigrated from Romania and Poland) and a distant cousin to violinist [[Itzhak Perlman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/jun/21/news/tv-61937 | title=New Afternoon Arrival | publisher=''Los Angeles Times'' | date=June 21, 1998 | accessdate=July 24, 2014 | author=Brownfield, Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was a lighting manufacturer and a real estate agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/9/Howie-Mandel.html|title=Howie Mandel Biography (1955-)|website=www.filmreference.com|access-date=2016-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mandel was expelled from his high school ([[William Lyon Mackenzie Collegiate Institute]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://corp.gsn.com/bios/howie_mandell | title=Deal or No Deal Howie Mandell | publisher=''GSN Press Room'' | date=2006 | accessdate=May 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=January 2018}}) for impersonating a school official and hiring a construction company to build an addition to his school.&lt;ref name="cbc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Howie Mandel tours the playground|url=http://www.cbc.ca/archives/entry/howie-mandel-tours-the-playground|website=CBC Archives|publisher=CBC|accessdate=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, Mandel worked as a carpet salesman.&lt;ref name="cdn_encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite web|title=Howie Mandel|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/howie-mandel/|website=The Canadian Encyclopedia|accessdate=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a stand-up comedian at [[Yuk Yuk's]] in Toronto and by September 1978 had a week-long booking as featured act, billed as "a wild and crazy borderline [[psychosis|psychotic]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Toronto Star]], September 12, 1978, p. D1&lt;/ref&gt; His repertoire included placing a latex glove over his head and inflating it by blowing through his nose, the fingers of the glove extending above his head like a [[Chicken crest|cockscomb]]. When the audience reacted uproariously to that and similar antics, his trademark response was to extend his arms palms up, look incredulous, and say, "it's you." His manager during the Yuk Yuk years was Canadian David Holiff who Mandel later fired. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://pgnewspapers.pgpl.ca/fedora/repository/pgc%3A1984-11-27-18/OCR/Full%20Text%20OCR|last=The Citizen|title=Canadian Performers: Holiff offers helping hand|date=27 November 1984|location=Prince George|accessdate=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On a trip to [[Los Angeles]], Mandel performed a set at [[The Comedy Store]], which resulted in his becoming a regular performer there. A producer for the comedic game show ''[[Make Me Laugh]]'' saw him and booked Mandel for several appearances during the show's run in 1979. He was booked to open for [[David Letterman]] at shows in the summer of 1979.&lt;ref&gt;[[Toronto Star]], July 19, 1979, p. C6&lt;/ref&gt; [[CBC-TV]]'s head of variety programming saw his performance in October 1979 and immediately signed him for a TV special. In 1980, he won the lead role in the Canadian movie ''[[Gas (1981 film)|Gas]]'', co-starring [[Susan Anspach]] and [[Donald Sutherland]]. Mandel was one of the first "VeeJays" to appear on [[Nickelodeon|Nickelodeon's]] music video series, ''[[Pop Clips]]''.

==TV and film career==
[[File:Howie Mandel at the 39th Emmy Awards.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Mandel at the 39th Emmy Awards in 1987]]

Mandel came to national attention in the US during a six-year run on ''[[St. Elsewhere]]'', starting in 1982 and playing the role of Dr. Wayne Fiscus, opposite the late [[Ed Flanders]], and [[Norman Lloyd (actor)|Norman Lloyd]], with whom he remains good friends as of 2015. While working as Dr. Fiscus, and continuing to work as a comedian, he also did movies, including his role as the voice of Gizmo in the 1984 hit ''[[Gremlins]]'' and its 1990 sequel ''[[Gremlins 2: The New Batch]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/55390/gremlins-and-gremlins-2-new-batch-hit-blu-ray-check-out-some-clips|title=Gremlins and Gremlins 2: The New Batch Hit Blu-ray! Check Out Some Clips - Dread Central|date=2012-05-09|website=Dread Central|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985, Mandel made a cameo in the [[Michael J. Fox]] directed short "The Iceman Hummeth" which was subsequently broadcast on ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'' in November 1985. In 1986, he starred in ''[[A Fine Mess (film)|A Fine Mess]]'' alongside [[Ted Danson]]. He performed his stand-up comedy act in several cities (the ''Watusi Tour''), which was followed by his ''Watusi'' music video in 1987. For the first two seasons of ''[[Muppet Babies]]'', he voiced [[Bunsen Honeydew]], [[Animal (Muppet)|Animal]], and [[Skeeter (Muppet)|Skeeter]]. He starred alongside [[Amy Steel]] in the 1987 comedy film ''[[Walk Like a Man (1987 film)|Walk Like a Man]]''. He was also "Maurice" in the 1989 movie ''[[Little Monsters]]''. In 1990, he starred in the short-lived sitcom ''[[Good Grief (TV series)|Good Grief]]'' on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]. He was also the creator and executive producer of the Emmy-nominated children's [[animated series]] ''[[Bobby's World]]'' (1990–1998), to which he supplied the voices of the title character and his father (using Howie's "normal" voice for Bobby's dad). ''Bobby's World'' ran for eight seasons on Fox and was later [[Television syndication|syndicated]]. Mandel also plays his alter-ego, Phil Skorjanc, in most of his comedy shows and these are a fan favorite. Bobby also made a cameo appearance in a February 2007 episode of ''[[Deal or No Deal (U.S. game show)|Deal or No Deal]]''. On a special 2-hour Christmas episode, first aired on December 25, 2007, Mandel delivered one line with Bobby's voice, as per request of the contestant. Also he was the voice of Jack in the movie [[The Tangerine Bear]].

In 1994, Mandel voiced the lead character, Little Howie, of the video game ''[[Tuneland]]''. He starred in the sketch comedy series ''[[Howie Mandel's Sunny Skies]]'' in 1995 on [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]]. Mandel appeared in the 1995 [[Clint Black]] [[country music]] video "[[Summer's Comin']]". He played the lead role of the professor in the short-lived TV series ''[[The Amazing Live Sea Monkeys]]'', and guest-starred on a 1996 episode of the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] TV series ''[[Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]'' as [[DC Comics]] [[supervillain]] [[Mister Mxyzptlk]]. In 1998, he hosted his own syndicated talk show, ''[[The Howie Mandel Show]]'', which was cancelled after one season. In 1999/2000, Mandel played "Jason" in the film ''[[Apocalypse III: Tribulation]]'', and in 2002 played the Sand Man in the movie ''[[Hansel and Gretel (2002 film)|Hansel and Gretel]]''. In 2006, he appeared as himself as a guest host in a [[parody]] of ''Deal or No Deal'' in the [[show-within-a-show]] of the TV series ''[[Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip]]''. In 2007, he guest-starred as himself in an episode of NBC's ''[[Medium (TV series)|Medium]]'', making a dream cameo of himself on ''Deal or No Deal.'' In that episode, he booted off the nighttime drama's protagonist for "cheating", since in the show he is a [[psychic]] medium and appeared to "know" the contents of the cases.

Mandel's signature stunt as a stand-up comedian (besides his Bobby alter-ego) was stretching a [[latex glove]] over his head and inflating it with his nostrils, filling it until it suddenly propelled itself off his head. This trick also lent itself to the title and cover photo of his comedy album, ''Fits Like a Glove'' (1986). He eventually gave up the routine under doctor's orders after being diagnosed with a perforated sinus. However, in a cameo role as himself on ''[[My Name is Earl]]'', he did the routine. He guest starred in two episodes of ''[[Monk (TV series)|Monk]]'' ("Mr. Monk Joins a Cult" and "[[Mr. Monk's 100th Case]]").

==Later work==

Mandel is known for his frequent appearances as a comedian and for his [[hidden camera]] segments on ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]''. He has appeared in many television commercials for [[Boston Pizza]] as their hired spokesperson. In April 2004, he was selected as number 82 on [[Comedy Central]]'s list of the 100 greatest stand up comedians of all time. In October 2005, he was named to be the host of the US version of ''[[Deal or No Deal (U.S. game show)|Deal or No Deal]]'', which debuted on December 19, 2005, on [[NBC]] and became a popular program in early 2006. Mandel also hosts ''[[Deal or No Deal Canada]]''; originating from Toronto, ''Deal or No Deal Canada'' debuted in January 2007 on [[Global Television Network|Global]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/globaltv/globalshows/et_story.html?id=fe168ca7-8b94-45ea-a76a-9b487f1690ef&amp;k=78245 |title=Deal or No Deal, eh? |work=Canada.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015120401/http://canada.com/globaltv/globalshows/et_story.html?id=fe168ca7-8b94-45ea-a76a-9b487f1690ef&amp;k=78245 |archivedate=October 15, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which made him one of the few game show hosts (''[[Weakest Link (U.S. game show)|Weakest Link']]''s [[Anne Robinson]], [[The Chair (game show)|The Chair]]{{'}}s [[John McEnroe]], [[Pyramid (game show)|Pyramid]]{{'}}s [[Donny Osmond]], [[The Singing Bee (U.S. game show)|The Singing Bee]]{{'}}s [[Joey Fatone]], and [[Minute to Win It]]{{'}}s [[Darren McMullen]] being others) to host both a domestic and an international version of the same game show. Mandel joins [[Alex Trebek]], [[Jim Perry (television)|Jim Perry]], and [[Geoff Edwards]] on the list of game show hosts who emceed one game show simultaneously in Canada and the United States.

In 2007, Mandel made an appearance in an episode of ''[[Sesame Street]]''’s 38th season. That same year, he was parodied on the show as Howie Eatswell, the [[Muppet]] host of ''Sesame''{{'}}s game show segment "Meal or No Meal". Mandel has hosted the DVD game version of ''Deal or No Deal'', "Fact or Crap Beat Da Bomb" and "Would You Rather" for [[Imagination Games]].

Mandel had a cameo appearance as himself on the NBC show ''[[My Name is Earl]]'', in the episode Earl's roommates robbed an Indian casino at which Mandel was performing. While stealing money, they also kidnapped Mandel. In the episode, Mandel performed his old routine of inflating a rubber glove over his head with his nostrils.

Mandel is a notable alumnus of Beth David B'nai Israel Beth Am's Hebrew School located in Toronto, as well as three other Toronto high schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cjnews.com/pastissues/00/apr6-00/tab/tab1.htm |title=Howie Mandel to headline ICRF gala |work=Canadian Jewish News |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050426161719/http://www.cjnews.com/pastIssues/00/apr6-00/tab/tab1.htm |archivedate=April 26, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mandel is currently performing a variety/comedy act at the [[MGM Grand Las Vegas|MGM Grand Hotel-Casino]] in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]].

Starting in 2007, Mandel became a spokesperson for Internet retailer buy.com. He is sometimes featured in a section called "What's Shakin'?" with Mandel. On September 8, 2008, Mandel began hosting a five-day-a-week [[Television syndication|syndicated]] daytime version of ''[[Deal or No Deal (U.S. syndicated game show)|Deal or No Deal]]'', with a top prize of $500,000. On January 9, 2009, Mandel's reality show ''[[Howie Do It]]'' premiered on NBC.

On March 31, 2011, Mandel premiered a [[Flash mob|flash-mob]] show on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] called ''[[Mobbed]]''. Originally a presentation pilot, the ratings after ''[[American Idol]]'' prompted Fox to pick up the show for eight to ten episodes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/01/us-mobbed-idUSTRE73073120110401 "Network orders Howie Mandel's "Mobbed".' to series"] Reuters, April 1, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 30, 2012, he hosted the NASCAR [[Sprint Cup Series|Sprint Cup]] Awards Ceremony. On December 10, 2012, his six-night special game show, ''[[Take It All (game show)|Take It All]]'', premiered.

He appeared in one episode of the animated series ''Fugget About It'' as the voice of FBI Agent Rick Chickmagnet in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Fugget About It (TV Series 2012–2016)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1799834/fullcredits|language=en|accessdate=2018-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2013, Mandel has executive-produced the TBS hidden-camera show ''[[Deal with It (TV series)|Deal with It]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.entlawdigest.com/2014/02/03/2934.htm |accessdate=2014-03-17 |date=2014-02-03 |title=Prank TV show sued for $100,000 |author=Matt Reynolds |work=Entertainment Law Digest}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deadline.com/2013/01/tbs-orders-howie-mandel-hidden-camera-series-mark-burnett-game-show/ |title=TBS Orders Howie Mandel Hidden Camera Series, Mark Burnett Game Show |accessdate=2014-03-17 |date=2013-01-11 |work=Deadline |author=Nellie Andreeva}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also regularly makes appearances and co-hosts the show along with main host [[Theo Von]].

===''Deal or No Deal''===
In 2003, while Mandel was deciding whether or not to quit show business, the executive producers at NBC asked him to host the show, but he declined many times. They then mailed him a tape of the overseas version and he finally accepted.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} In 2007, he hosted a five-episode run of the Canadian-English version. The show then went to daytime with Mandel remaining as host, although [[Arsenio Hall]] was originally intended to host the show. In a January 2009 interview on ''[[Anytime with Bob Kushell]]'', Mandel expressed mild, jovial frustration over how some of his contestants hold out during the game show, despite the fact that the grand prize is many times what they would make in a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | title = Anytime with Bob Kushell feat. Howie Mandel | series = Anytime with Bob Kushell | airdate = January 15, 2009 | season = 1 | number = 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 12, 2018, it was announced that Mandel will host the 2018 [[CNBC]] revival of the game show, and also become an executive producer. &lt;ref&gt;http://deadline.com/2018/03/cnbc-greenlights-deal-or-no-deal-reboot-howie-mandel-1202336799/&lt;/ref&gt; The show will premiere on December 5, 2018.

===''America's Got Talent''===
In January 2010, it was announced that Mandel would replace [[David Hasselhoff]] as one of the judges on NBC's ''[[America's Got Talent]]'' after Hasselhoff announced that he was leaving to work on a new television series.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Howie-Mandel-Joins-1013555.aspx|title=Howie Mandel Joins America's Got Talent|date=2010-01-10|website=TVGuide.com|access-date=2016-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. 5th edition.&lt;/ref&gt; Mandel's anxiety affects him to the point that he does not shake hands with anyone, including enthusiastic contestants on ''Deal or No Deal'', unless he is wearing latex gloves. Instead of shaking contestants' hands when they offer them, Mandel often opts to exchange [[fist bump]]s, put his hands on contestants' shoulders, or give an occasional hug. He once kissed a female contestant on the show for good luck despite his disorder. He now takes medicine to control his condition and even pokes fun at himself for it. He revealed on ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'' on March 24, 2006, that his shaved head is not related to natural hair loss, but to OCD. He stated that the lack of hair makes him feel cleaner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.howardstern.com/rundown.hs?d=1143176400 HALLE THE HUMORLESS] Howard Stern official site, March 24, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In the back yard of Mandel's house is a second, smaller house which he had built especially to live in solitude when a family member is sick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSZNnz9SM4g|title=Howie Mandel Talks About Living With OCD|author=ABC News|date=2009-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his appearance on ''[[Mad TV]]'', Mandel and cast member [[Bobby Lee]] made fun of the former's condition. Mandel also confronted his germophobia in Season 4, Episode 1 of the Comedy Central series ''This Is Not Happening''. The show aired on February 3, 2018. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cc.com/episodes/9fbjfz/this-is-not-happening-filth-season-4-ep-401|title=This Is Not Happening - Filth {{!}} Comedy Central|website=Comedy Central|access-date=2018-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While guest-hosting on ''[[Live with Kelly and Ryan|Live with Regis and Kelly]]'' in 2005, Mandel had an altercation in which his hand was seized by guest [[Rob Schneider]]; who condescendingly teased Mandel, stating he needed to 'get over' his phobia. Host [[Kelly Ripa]] admonished Schneider on-air, while also obtaining hand sanitizer for Mandel from an audience member. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ROB SCHNEIDER SHAKES HOWIE MANDEL'S HAND

In September 2007, Mandel interviewed former [[National Football League|NFL]] running back [[Marshall Faulk]] on [[NFL Network]]. Faulk asked him to shake hands, but Mandel refused, noting he would rather have the fist tap, as he does with ''Deal or No Deal'' contestants. Seconds later, Faulk subjected him to a "sneak attack", and shook his right hand. Mandel screamed and walked away from Faulk. He then washed his hands several times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marshall Faulk attacks Howie Mandel|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUT2G4Rb92o|accessdate=December 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On a guest appearance on ''[[Free Radio (TV series)|Free Radio]]'', Mandel explained that not only is he afraid of public bathrooms, but is unable to use any bathroom other than his own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vids.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=vids.individual&amp;VideoID=28247050 |title=Video – MySpace Video |publisher=MySpace |accessdate=August 4, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090630043049/http://vids.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=vids.individual&amp;VideoID=28247050 |archivedate=June 30, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the season 5 episode of ''[[America's Got Talent]]'' in Chicago, Zach Carty attempted an act involving sneezing. Mandel pressed his X button at the beginning of the act, and ran into an aisle until the act was over. (Carty was unable to perform the act.) Mandel kept yelling at the other judges, [[Piers Morgan]] and [[Sharon Osbourne]], to press their X buttons and for the audience to turn in his direction. Morgan eventually pressed the X button, but Osbourne refused, so Mandel promptly ran over and pressed her button, ending the act. In a backstage interview, he expressed to the television audience that he receives therapy to help him cope. In another ''America's Got Talent'' season 5 incident, Dan Sperry, a contestant on the YouTube quarterfinal episode, dropped some dental floss that he had run through his neck as part of a magic act. He dropped the floss in Mandel's vicinity, prompting him to get up and run to the other side of the judges' table.{{episode needed|date=July 2017}}&lt;!-- video has disappeared &lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1n7Y9EA17yQ&lt;/ref&gt; ---&gt; Just before Sperry's next performance in the semifinals, Mandel admitted that it was "the most horrified" he'd been on the show and that his therapist "loves [Dan Sperry]", because there had been two extra sessions that week.&lt;!-- video has disappeared &lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjueImBkTDw&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;{{episode needed|date=July 2017}} A final season 5 incident happened when juggler Frank Oliver grabbed Mandel's head to balance himself during a unicycle act. Despite receiving a buzzer from Mandel, Oliver moved on to the next round. Mandel refused to give Oliver any feedback during the judge's voting process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://youtube.com/watch?v=meXexacT3hI|title=Frank Olivier, 50 ~ America's Got Talent 2011, LA Auditions|first=|last=AmericanIdolReviews|date=August 2, 2011|publisher=|accessdate=July 27, 2017|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[America's Got Talent (season 10)|''AGT'''s 10th season]], a contestant named Chris Jones directly utilized Mandel's mysophobia (fear of germs) as the subject of his [[hypnotism]] act. Under the [[post-hypnotic suggestion]] that Jones and the other judges were wearing latex gloves, Mandel shook the bare hands of all involved, which elicited shouts of amazement and drew much attention on the [[Internet]]. After viewing the video of the act, Mandel said that he was "upset about it" and "somewhat betrayed" by the act but that his therapist subsequently said it was a good thing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.today.com/popculture/howie-mandel-says-agt-hypnotism-act-didnt-cure-him-t23106|title=Howie Mandel says 'AGT' hypnotism didn't cure him, it sent him to therapy|last=Hines|first=Ree|work=[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]]|date=May 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chris Jones progressed to the Judge's Cuts where he was eliminated from the competition.

Mandel commented in 2011 that he has struggled with the condition since childhood, but did not seek help until he was an adult:
{{quote|"I don’t remember a time when I didn’t feel there was an issue. But I wasn’t diagnosed until adulthood. I’ve always felt a little bit different, and I always knew I wasn’t as comfortable with life as everybody else seemed to be. But I didn’t know what I could do about it. When I was a kid, I didn’t know anybody who went to a psychiatrist. There was always a stigma attached to mental health issues. I think there still is. But now I’m taking care of myself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abilitymagazine.com/Howie-Mandel.html|title=''Ability Magazine: Howie Mandel Interview with Chet Cooper"'' (2011)|accessdate=2012-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
