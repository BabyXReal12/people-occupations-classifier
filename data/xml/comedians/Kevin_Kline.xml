Kline has described his mother as the "dramatic theatrical character in our family".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kevin Kline star bio|work=Tribute|url=http://www.tribute.ca/bio.asp?id=2164|year=2008|accessdate=June 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kline's father was [[Jewish]], from a family that had emigrated from [[German Jew|Germany]], and had become an agnostic. Kline's mother was a Roman Catholic of [[Irish American|Irish]] descent, the daughter of an emigrant from [[County Louth]]. Kline was raised in his mother's Catholic faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1876&amp;dat=19830211&amp;id=-FEsAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Vc4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5848,2227600|title=Herald-Journal - Google News Archive Search|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has an older sister, Kate, and two younger brothers, Alexander and Christopher.&lt;ref name=obu1/&gt; 

He graduated from the [[Saint Louis Priory School]] in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/movies/person/38699/Kevin-Kline "Kevin Kline Biography"] ''The New York Times'', accessed February 12, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, the school named its new auditorium as the Kevin Kline Theater in his honor. Kline performed selections from Shakespeare as a benefit at the dedication.

He attended [[Indiana University Bloomington|Indiana University, Bloomington]], where he was a classmate of actor [[Jonathan Banks]]. He began studying composing and conducting music, but switched to a theater and speech major for his last two years, graduating in 1970. Kline remembers: "When I switched to the Theater Department, all I did was theater...I could barely make it to class because this was my passion."&lt;ref&gt;Lindquist, David.

==Career==
[[File:Kevin Kline, No Strings Attached Premiere.jpg|thumb|Kline at the film premiere of ''No Strings Attached'' in January 2011]]
In 1970, Kline was awarded a scholarship to the newly formed Drama Division at the [[Juilliard School]] in New York. In 1972, he joined with fellow Juilliard graduates, including [[Patti LuPone]] and [[David Ogden Stiers]], and formed the City Center Acting Company (now [[The Acting Company]]), under the aegis of [[John Houseman]].&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Alvin. [https://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/12/nyregion/theater-from-juilliard-to-shakespeare-at-a-pond.html?pagewanted= "Theater. From Juilliard to Shakespeare at a Pond"] ''The New York Times'', July 12, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

The Company traveled across the U.S. performing [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s plays, other classical works, and the musical ''[[The Robber Bridegroom (musical)|The Robber Bridegroom]]'', founding one of the most widely praised groups in American repertory theatre. At Juilliard, he studied singing with [[Beverley Peck Johnson]].&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/22/arts/beverley-peck-johnson-96-voice-teacher.html|title=Beverley Peck Johnson, 96, Voice Teacher|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=January 22, 2001|author=[[Anthony Tommasini]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, Kline left The Acting Company and settled in [[New York City]], doing a brief appearance as the character "Woody Reed" in the now-defunct soap opera ''[[Search for Tomorrow]]''. He followed this with a return to the stage in 1977 to play Clym Yeobright opposite Donna Theodore as Eustacia Vye in The Hudson Guild Theater production of ''Dance on a Country Grave'', Kelly Hamilton's musical version of Thomas Hardy's ''[[The Return of the Native]]''.&lt;ref name="ibdb"/&gt; In 1978, he played the role of Bruce Granit, a matinée idol caricature, in [[Harold Prince]]'s ''[[On the Twentieth Century]]'', for which he won his first [[Tony Award]]. In 1981, Kline appeared with rock diva [[Linda Ronstadt]] and singer [[Rex Smith]] in the New York Shakespeare Festival's Central Park production of ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'', winning another [[Tony Award]] for Best Leading Actor in a Musical, for his comically dashing portrayal of the Pirate King.&lt;ref name="ibdb"/&gt; In 1983, he played the role in a [[The Pirates of Penzance (1983 film)|film version]] of the musical, also with Ronstadt, Smith and [[Angela Lansbury]], which had a limited theatrical release.&lt;ref&gt;Maslin, Janet.

In the ensuing years, Kline appeared many times in [[New York Shakespeare Festival]] productions of Shakespeare plays, including starring roles in ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'' (1983),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lortel.org/Archives/Production/1955 "'King Richard III', Delacort Theater"] lortel.org, accessed February 12, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'' (1988),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lortel.org/Archives/Production/1566 "'Much Ado About Nothing', Delacort Theater"] lortel.org, accessed February 12, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'' (1984),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lortel.org/Archives/Production/1881 "'Henry V', Delacort Theater"] lortel.org, accessed February 12, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; and two productions of ''[[Hamlet]]'', in 1986&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lortel.org/Archives/Production/1814 "'Hamlet' 1986, Delacort Theater"] lortel.org, accessed February 12, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; and 1990 (which he also directed).&lt;ref&gt;  [http://www.lortel.org/Archives/Production/1253  "'Hamlet' 1990, Delacort Theater"] lortel.org, accessed February 12, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; A videotape of the 1990 production has aired on PBS.

He also appeared in a Lincoln Center production that combined the two parts of ''Henry IV'' on Broadway at the [[Vivian Beaumont Theatre]] in 2003 as Falstaff. Kline was nominated for the 2004 Tony Award, Actor in a Play.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.playbillvault.com/Show/Detail/11223/Henry-IV "'Henry 1V Broadway"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150914031405/http://www.playbillvault.com/Show/Detail/11223/Henry-IV |date=September 14, 2015 }} playbillvault.com, accessed February 12, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simonson, Robert.

Dubbed "the American [[Laurence Olivier|Olivier]]" by ''[[New York Times]]'' theater critic [[Frank Rich]] for his stage acting,&lt;ref&gt;Charles Isherwood, [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/01/theater/01kline.html "This King, This Courtier, These Kevin Klines"], nytimes.com, January 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Kline finally ventured into film in 1982 in ''[[Sophie's Choice (film)|Sophie's Choice]]''. He won the coveted role of the tormented and mercurial Nathan opposite [[Meryl Streep]]. Streep won an [[Academy Award]] for her performance in the film. Kline was nominated for a 1983 [[Golden Globe]] award (New Star of the Year)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goldenglobes.com/film/sophies-choice "'Sophie's Choice' Golden Globe Awards and Nominations"] goldenglobes.com, accessed February 11, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; and [[BAFTA Award]] for Most Outstanding Newcomer To Film.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hollywood.com/movies/sophie-s-choice-59129594/awards/ "'Sophie's Choice' Awards and Nominations"] hollywood.com, accessed February 11, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1980s and early 1990s, Kline made several films with director [[Lawrence Kasdan]], including ''[[The Big Chill (film)|The Big Chill]]'', ''[[Silverado (film)|Silverado]]'', ''[[Grand Canyon (1991 film)|Grand Canyon]]'', ''[[I Love You to Death]]'', and ''[[French Kiss (1995 film)|French Kiss]]''. He played [[Donald Woods]] in [[Richard Attenborough]]'s ''[[Cry Freedom]]'' opposite [[Denzel Washington]] about the friendship between Activist [[Stephen Biko]] and editor Donald Woods.

In 1989, Kline won an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] for his role in the British comedy ''[[A Fish Called Wanda]]'', in which he played a painfully inept American ex-[[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] thug opposite [[John Cleese]]'s genteel British barrister and [[Jamie Lee Curtis]]' femme fatale/con woman. In 2000, the [[American Film Institute]] ranked the film twenty-first on [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Laughs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=100 Years, 100 Laughs|publisher=American Film Institute|url=http://www.afi.com/tvevents/100years/laughs.aspx|year=2000|accessdate=June 7, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080603155528/http://www.afi.com/tvevents/100years/laughs.aspx|archivedate=June 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other awards have included [[Drama Desk Award]]s, [[Golden Globe]] awards, a [[Gotham Award]], a [[Hasty Pudding Theatricals|Hasty Pudding Theatricals Man of the Year Award]], and a [[St. Louis International Film Festival]] Lifetime Achievement Award. He was inducted in the [[American Theatre Hall of Fame]] in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americantheatrecritics.org/theatre-hall-of-fame|title=American Theatre Critics Association|publisher=Americantheatrecritics.org|date=2014-01-29|accessdate=2015-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has a star on the [[St. Louis Walk of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stlouiswalkoffame.org/inductees/?view=achievement|title=St. Louis Walk of Fame Inductees|last=St. Louis Walk of Fame|publisher=stlouiswalkoffame.org|accessdate=April 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Film reviewers have praised Kline. ''[[Newsday]]'' critic Lynn Darling wrote on July 13, 1988, that Kline "has proved himself to be one of the most talented and versatile American actors of his generation."

Kline played the title role in ''[[King Lear]]'' at the [[Public Theater]] and took the lead role in a Broadway production of ''[[Cyrano de Bergerac (play)|Cyrano de Bergerac]]'' opposite [[Jennifer Garner]].  That production was forced to close temporarily after only 11 performances as a result of the Broadway stagehands' strike,&lt;ref name="Cyrano"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hetrick |first=Adam |title=Morton, Sarandon and Baker Will Join Kline in Broadway's Cyrano; Casting Complete |publisher=Playbill |date=September 25, 2007 |url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/111357.html |accessdate=September 26, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013011153/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/111357.html |archivedate=October 13, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but subsequently reopened. ''Cyrano'' was filmed in 2008 and aired as part of [[PBS]]'s ''[[Great Performances]]'' series in January 2009.

In January 2008, Kline won a [[Screen Actors Guild]] award for his portrayal of Jaques in [[Kenneth Branagh]]'s film ''[[As You Like It (2006 film)|As You Like It]]'', adapted from [[As You Like It|Shakespeare's play]]. The film premiered theatrically in 2006 in Europe. It bypassed theatres and was sent straight to [[HBO]] in the U.S. Kline's film ''[[The Conspirator]]'' premiered during the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] in 2010 and was described as an "old-fashioned historical thriller". It was well received by most critics. Kline also starred in the 2012 comedy ''[[Darling Companion]]'' alongside [[Diane Keaton]]. In 2017, Kline returned to Broadway in a revival of the play ''[[Present Laughter]]'', for which he received his third [[Tony Award]].

In December 2004, Kline became the 2,272nd recipient of a star on [[List of stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame|Hollywood Walk of Fame]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/news/People/Kline-gets-Hollywood-star/2004/12/04/1101923372496.html "Kline gets Hollywood star"], TheAge.com.au, December 4, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; for his contributions to the motion picture industry, located at 7000 [[Hollywood Boulevard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/kevin-kline/|title=Kevin Kline|website=latimes.com|access-date=2016-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
[[File:Phoebe Cates 3.jpg|thumb|right|Kline and his wife Phoebe Cates at the Academy Awards Governor's Ball party, 1989]]
Kline met actress [[Phoebe Cates]] in 1983. They began dating in 1985 and married in 1989. The couple live on the Upper East Side of Manhattan in New York City. They have two children, Owen (born 1991) and Greta (1994), who fronts the band [[Frankie Cosmos]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pelly|first=Jenn|title=Frankie Cosmos|url=http://pitchfork.com/features/rising/9345-frankie-cosmos|publisher=Pitchfork Media|accessdate=March 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his son, Owen, was diagnosed with [[juvenile diabetes]], Kline became active with the [[Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation]].
