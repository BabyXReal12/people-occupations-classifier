Kirkman performs stand-up comedy in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], appearing regularly at the [[Hollywood Improv]], [[The Laugh Factory]], [[Largo (nightclub)|Largo]] and [[The Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre]]. She has performed with comedians [[Maria Bamford]], [[Greg Behrendt]], [[Mike Birbiglia]] and [[Chelsea Handler]]. In 2009 and 2010, she performed as part of the ''Comedians of Chelsea Lately''.

===Television===
Kirkman was a narrator on two episodes of the [[Funny or Die]]-produced series ''Drunk History'' on [[HBO]], which received the jury prize for "Best Short Film" at the 2010 [[Sundance Film Festival]]. Though it is often questioned, she ''was'' actually drunk for both episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.serialoptimist.com/interviews/jen-kirkman-comedian-writer-actress-my-fantasy-best-friend-384.html | title =Serial Optimist | date = August 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has made guest appearances on several [[United States|American]] television talk shows, including ''[[Conan (talk show)|Conan]]'', [[The View (U.S. TV series)|''The View'']], and ''[[The Late Show with Stephen Colbert]]'', and has performed on ''[[The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson]]'', ''[[Late Friday]]'', ''[[Premium Blend]]'', ''[[@midnight]]'' and ''Special Sauce''. In 2007, she appeared as a cast member on the short-lived [[sketch comedy]] show ''[[Acceptable.TV]]'' on [[VH1]]. She has also made regular [[voice-over]] appearances on the [[Adult Swim]] series ''[[Home Movies (TV Series)|Home Movies]]'' and the [[political satire]] animated series ''[[SuperNews!]]'' on [[Current TV]]. In 2009, she wrote two episodes of the [[Disney Channel]] animated series ''[[Phineas and Ferb]]''.

Most notably, Kirkman was a staff writer and round-table regular on [[E!]]'s ''Chelsea Lately''. On June 3, 2010, she announced she would be leaving ''Chelsea Lately'' to join the writing staff for ''[[Perfect Couples]]'', a romantic [[situation comedy]] which premiered as a mid-season replacement on [[NBC]] on January 20, 2011. She continued to make occasional round-table appearances on ''Chelsea Lately'', beginning in late 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://twitter.com/JenKirkman/status/19532758495 | title = I'll be back on Chelsea on the roundtable probably in December. Until then… | last = Kirkman | first = Jen | date = July 26, 2010 | publisher = Twitter | accessdate = September 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Perfect Couples'' was removed from the NBC schedule on March 11, 2011, and Kirkman returned to the writing staff of ''Chelsea Lately'' in April 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/465656-NBC_s_Paul_Reiser_Show_Replacing_Perfect_Couples_.php | title = NBC's 'Paul Reiser Show' Replacing 'Perfect Couples' | last = Morabito | first = Andrea | date = March 22, 2011 | publisher = Broadcasting &amp; Cable | accessdate = May 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, she began making regular appearances on the second season of ''[[After Lately]]''.

In November 2013, ''[[Deadline Hollywood|Deadline]]'' reported that [[FX (TV network)|FX]] had landed a script deal to ''Jen,'' a half-hour [[Situation comedy|sitcom]] executive produced, written by and starring Kirkman. The series, set in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], centered on a recently divorced a woman in her mid-30s. The project was backed by Borderline Amazing Productions, with executive producers [[Chelsea Handler]], Tom Brunelle and Brad Wollack.&lt;ref name="deadline-series"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.deadline.com/2013/11/jen-kirkman-to-star-in-create-fx-comedy-produced-by-chelsea-handler | title = Jen Kirkman To Star In &amp; Create FX Comedy Produced By Chelsea Handler | last = Andreeva | first = Nellie | date = November 15, 2013 | publisher = Deadline | accessdate = January 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015, she released her stand-up feature on [[Netflix]], ''I'm Gonna Die Alone (And I Feel Fine).'' Her second stand-up feature for [[Netflix]], ''Just Keep Livin'?,'' premiered on January 3, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.netflix.com/title/80134966 | title = Netflix: Jen Kirkman's Just Keep Livin'? | last = Kirkman | first = Jen | date = January 3, 2017 | publisher = Broadcasting &amp; Cable | accessdate = March 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Kirkman contributed to the first season of ''[[The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel]]'' as a writer and consultant. The series, created by [[Amy Sherman-Palladino]] for [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]], is "loosely based on the concept of Joan Rivers’ career."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.amny.com/entertainment/jen-kirkman-s-stand-up-show-tackles-global-issues-with-personal-lens-1.14228669|title=Comedian makes global issues personal in stand-up show|work=am New York|access-date=2017-10-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 11, 2017, it was reported that [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] had started development on ''The Mighty Quinn'', a television series written by Kirkman and produced by [[Julie Anne Robinson]]. The half-hour comedy series focuses on "39-year-old Quinn, who, after getting dumped by her boyfriend on Christmas Day, takes a year off from dating to find herself."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://deadline.com/2017/10/abc-developing-the-mighty-quinn-comedy-jen-kirkman-cannylands-1202186166/|title=ABC Buys ‘The Mighty Quinn’ Comedy From Jen Kirkman &amp; Julie Anne Robinson|last=Petski|first=Denise|date=2017-10-11|website=Deadline Hollywood|access-date=2017-10-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/television/2017/10/12/kirkman-abc-project-mighty-quinn/wamU5PTj9SXET7TL7LN8VK/story.html|title=Kirkman in ABC project ‘Mighty Quinn’|work=BostonGlobe.com|access-date=2017-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comedy writing===
Kirkman's first book, ''I Can Barely Take Care of Myself: Tales From a Happy Life Without Kids'', was published in [[hardcover]] on April 16, 2013, and was listed on the ''[[New York Times]]'' [[New York Times Best Seller list|Non-Fiction Best Seller]] list. In late 2013, she signed her second book deal with [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], a follow-up to her best-selling debut.&lt;ref name="deadline-series" /&gt; Her second book, ''I Know What I'm Doing and Other Lies I Tell Myself: Dispatches from a Life Under Construction,'' was published in April 2016. She also has several published essays, which have been included in ''Rejected: Tales of the Failed, Dumped &amp; Canceled'' and ''Bad Sex: We Did It So You Don’t Have To''.

In 2001, Kirkman founded ''Girlcomic.net'' with fellow comedian Becky Donohue. The website featured interviews with comedians such as [[Joy Behar]], [[Margaret Cho]], [[Sue Murphy]], [[Amy Poehler]] and [[Sarah Silverman]]. On the intention of the website, Kirkman stated, "[that the] one thing about feeling like there are still threads of sexism is women can get discouraged and we wanted [to encourage] girls to write funny stories and we wanted to interview famous female comics to let their stories get out. It was meant to be positive and cool and we included men on the site too."&lt;ref name="dead-frog" /&gt; Regular updates to the website ceased in 2003, and the domain was ultimately closed in 2006.

==Influences==
Kirkman has cited [[Joan Rivers]], [[Howard Stern]], [[Roseanne Barr]], [[Dave Chappelle]], [[Chris Rock]] and [[David Spade]] as having an influence on her sense of humor.&lt;ref name="dead-frog"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dead-frog.com/blog/entry/interview_jen_kirkman_stand_up_comedian/ | title = Interview: Jen Kirkman, Stand-Up Comedian | last = Jackson | first = Todd | date = March 19, 2007 | publisher = Dead-Frog | accessdate = February 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bed-joan"&gt;{{cite podcast|url=http://inbedwithjoan.com/2013/12/episode-40-jen-kirkman |title=In Bed With Joan |publisher=CCF Productions |host=Joan Rivers |date=December 18, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://the828.com/2017/10/18/jenkirkman/|title=Comedian Jen Kirkman Prepares For The Peel|last=|first=|date=2017-10-18|work=The 828|access-date=2017-10-19|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an eight-year-old, she would sneak over to a friend's house to watch [[Sam Kinison]] and [[George Carlin]] comedy specials on [[HBO]]. “[Kinison] was a big thing for me,” she said. “Someone is yelling, I’m not in trouble, and it’s ''funny''.”&lt;ref name="bed-joan" /&gt; She has cited [[Morrissey]] as perhaps her greatest influence, and although she is "nothing like him," his ability "to say morbid things with a sense of humor is now in my DNA."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/comedy/legendary-comedians-inspired-todays-humourists-20150318-142nnt.html | title = Legendary comedians inspired today's humourists | date = March 22, 2015 | publisher = Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
On August 21, 2009, Kirkman married writer/director Neil Mahoney in a private ceremony at the [[Wayside Inn]] in [[Sudbury, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/theater_arts/comedy/articles/2010/06/11/comedian_jen_kirkman_sees_star_rise_as_both_writer_and_performer/|title=A funny thing happened to Jen Kirkman|last=Anderman|first=Joan|date=June 11, 2010|accessdate=September 28, 2010|publisher=The Boston Globe}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the August 25, 2011 episode of ''Chelsea Lately'', she revealed she was no longer married. On the January 14, 2012 episode of the ''Pod F. Tompkast'', she confirmed that she and Mahoney had divorced.

Kirkman's nephew, Ari, suffers from [[gigantism]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/JenKirkman/status/7109308769 Jen Kirkman on Twitter: "For Rwanda! – Hey friends &amp; readers~ My brilliant and ambitious nephew, Buffalo (16) is making a plan to head... http://tumblr.com/xmd50rzd2"].
