'''Sandra Bernhard''' (born June 6, 1955) is an American actress, comedian, singer and author. She first gained attention in the late 1970s, with her [[stand-up comedy]] in which she often bitterly critiqued [[celebrity culture]] and political figures.

Bernhard is best known as portraying Nancy Barlett Thomas on the ABC sitcom ''[[Roseanne]]'' from the fourth season (1991) to the end of the show in 1997. Bernhard is number ninety-six on [[Comedy Central]]'s list of the 100 greatest stand-ups of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://m.ranker.com/list/comedy-central_s-100-greatest-standups-of-all-time-v1/celebrity-insider}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Bernhard was born in [[Flint, Michigan|Flint]], [[Michigan]], the daughter of Jeanette (''née'' LaZebnik) and [[proctologist]] Jerome Bernhard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/23/Sandra-Bernhard.html|title=Sandra Bernhard Biography (1955-)|publisher=FilmReference.com|accessdate= May 21, 2017| archivedate= March 1, 2017| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170301022103/http://www.filmreference.com/film/23/Sandra-Bernhard.html|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=momobit&gt;{{cite news|title=Jeanette (LaZebnik) Bernhard Obituaryu|url=http://obits.mlive.com/obituaries/jackson/obituary.aspx?pid=171571700|publisher=MLive Media Group|date=June 13, 2014|accessdate=May 21, 2017|archivedate=May 21, 2017|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6qcx44sCz?url=http://obits.mlive.com/obituaries/jackson/obituary.aspx?pid=171571700|deadurl=bot: unknown|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her parents raised her as a [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative Jew]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=At Home With: Sandra Bernhard; When Baby Talk Makes Good Material|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/22/dining/at-home-with-sandra-bernhard-when-baby-talk-makes-good-material.html | work=The New York Times | first=Julie V.|last=Iovine|date=October 22, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Bernhard became a staple at [[The Comedy Store]]. As her popularity as a comedian grew she was cast as a supporting player on ''[[The Richard Pryor Show]]'' in 1977. Guest appearances on evening talk shows followed. Her big break came in 1983 when she was cast by [[Martin Scorsese]] to star as stalker and kidnapper Masha in the film ''[[The King of Comedy (film)|The King of Comedy]]'' for which she won the [[National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Supporting Actress]].

She began performing her first one-woman show called ''[[I'm Your Woman]]'' in 1985, and an album version was released. Bernhard appeared in a variety of tiny film and television roles throughout the 1980s while crafting her stand-up routine into a more performance art oriented show. She launched an Off-Broadway one woman show called ''Without You I'm Nothing, with You I'm Not Much Better'' in 1988 which played at the [[Orpheum Theatre (Manhattan)|Orpheum Theatre]]. In 1990 it was turned into a [[Without You I'm Nothing (film)|film]] and a [[Without You I'm Nothing (Sandra Bernhard album)|double album]] of the same title. The film was mostly shot on location in 1989 in the coconut grove at the [[Ambassador Hotel (Los Angeles)|Ambassador Hotel]]. A frequent guest on [[David Letterman]]'s NBC program, it was during the run of 'Without You I'm Nothing, With You I'm Not Much Better' that she appeared with her then-good friend (and rumored lover) [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] on the show. The two alluded to their romantic relationship and staged a sexy confrontation. They would continue to be friends for several years, with Bernhard even making an appearance in Madonna's movie ''[[Madonna: Truth or Dare|Truth or Dare]]''.

In 1991, Bernhard began playing the role of Nancy Bartlett on the hit sitcom ''[[Roseanne (TV series)|Roseanne]]''. She appeared in 33 episodes between 1991 and 1997, and was one of the first actresses to portray an openly [[lesbian]] recurring character on American television. The role is one of her best known, something she has lamented in her stand-up as being both a blessing and a curse. In September 1992, Bernhard did a nude pictorial for ''[[Playboy]]''. She hosted the [[USA Network]]'s ''Reel Wild Cinema'' for two seasons beginning in 1995. Bernhard continued acting in mostly independent films and TV guest roles and forays into mainstream films such as ''[[Hudson Hawk]]'' and ''[[Dallas Doll]]''. In 1991 she released her first studio album, entitled ''[[Excuses for Bad Behavior#Part one|Excuses for Bad Behavior (Part One)]]''. In 1995, she briefly appeared as a guest in the animated talk show ''[[Space Ghost Coast to Coast]]'', in an episode titled "Jerk". In 1996, she guest-starred on an episode of ''[[Highlander: The Series]]'' called "Dramatic License" in which she played a romance novelist writing about the life of the main character. She also appeared (as herself) on ''[[Will&amp;nbsp;&amp; Grace]]'' in an episode dealing with Will and Grace's spuriously bidding on Bernhard's [[Manhattan]] apartment in order to become friendly with her and culminates in a diatribe from Bernhard when their ruse is exposed, with obfuscating sounds of a blender (she was having a smoothie made) blotting out supposed obscenities. She returned as herself briefly, two years later.

Bernhard returned to Broadway in 1998 with the show ''[[I'm Still Here... Damn It!]]'', recorded for a live comedy album. At that time of the show Bernhard was pregnant. She gave birth to daughter Cicely Yasin Bernhard on July 4, 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/1998/07/08/entertainment/main13451.shtml?source=search_story Bernhard Goes Maternal], ''[[CBS News]]'', July 8, 1998, last accessed July 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/News/9807/08/showbuzz/ Sandra Bernhard a mom at 42] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029070648/http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/News/9807/08/showbuzz/ |date=2008-10-29 }}, ''[[CNN]]'', July 8, 1998, last accessed July 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Bernhard returned to New York in 2006 with the [[Off-Broadway]] show ''[[Everything Bad &amp; Beautiful]]''. The CD ''Everything Bad &amp; Beautiful'' was critically lauded as one of her best, released by indie label Breaking Records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.breakingrecordsmusic.com|title=Breaking Records Music|work=Breaking Records Music}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The year 2007 saw the creation of Bernhard's show ''Plan B from Outer Space'' as well as Indie label upstart Breaking Records release of the compilation "Breaking For the Holidays" where Bernhard co-penned ''Miracle of Lights'' with Mitchell Kaplan. She toured "Plan B" through 2008, and performed ''Miracle of Lights'' on some morning shows in New York.

Bernhard was a featured guest singer with children's artist [[Dan Zanes]] on the ''Family Dance'' album's "Thrift Shop".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000QMTN3M amazon.com], ''Thrift Shop''&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with [[Howard Stern]], the comedian revealed that she was originally offered the role of [[Miranda Hobbes]] of TV show ''[[Sex and the City]]'', but opted out due to the "terrible" original script and low paycheck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/25/sandra-bernhard-sex-and-the-city-_n_1231667.html|title=Sandra Bernhard Turned Down 'Sex And The City' Role Due To 'Terrible' Script And Low Paycheck|work=The Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the media announced that Sandra Bernhard would be joining the cast of ABC Family's ''Switched at Birth'' along with ''Glee''{{'}}s [[Max Adler (actor)|Max Adler]]. Sandra would assume the role of an art professor on the Season 3 Opener in January 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Switched at Birth Adds Max Adler and Sandra Bernhard|url=http://www.tvfanatic.com/2013/10/switched-at-birth-adds-max-adler-and-sandra-bernhard/}}, TV Fanatic. October 11, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 2015, Bernhard began hosting a radio show, ''Sandyland'', on [[Sirius XM Holdings|Sirius XM]]'s, [[Radio Andy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.siriusxm.com/2016/12/26/behind-the-voice-sandra-bernhard-elevates-the-conversation-on-radio-andy/ Behind the Voice: Sandra Bernhard elevates the conversation on Radio Andy]&lt;/ref&gt;
