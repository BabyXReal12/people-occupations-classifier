His father died in a car accident, colliding with a drunk driver when Allen was eleven.&lt;ref name="actors"/&gt;&lt;ref name="YahooBio"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800021848/bio|title=Tim Allen Biography|publisher=Yahoo! Movies}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, his mother married her high school sweetheart, a business executive,&lt;ref name=intimacy/&gt; and moved with her six children to [[Birmingham, Michigan]], a suburb of [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]], to be with her new husband and his three children.&lt;ref name="Bio timeline"/&gt;

Allen attended [[Seaholm High School]] in Birmingham, where he was in theater and music classes (resulting in his love of classical piano). He then attended [[Central Michigan University]] before transferring to [[Western Michigan University]] in 1974.&lt;ref name="honorary"&gt;{{cite web|title=WMU awards Tim Allen honorary degree|url=http://www.wmich.edu/wmu/news/1998/9806/9798-338.html| publisher=Western Michigan University| accessdate=June 12, 2010|date=June 27, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Western Michigan, Allen worked at the student radio station [[WIDR]] and received a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in communications specializing in radio and television production in 1976 with a split minor in philosophy and design.&lt;ref name="Bio timeline"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tim Allen: Actor: Biography|url=http://www.timallen.com/actor/bio.php|website=timAllen.com |accessdate=June 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, Western Michigan awarded Allen an honorary Fine Arts degree and the Distinguished Alumni Award.&lt;ref name="honorary"/&gt;

== Career ==
[[File:Tim Allen (2076447441).jpg|thumb|right|Allen at the 45th Emmy Awards]]

Allen started his career as a comedian in 1975.&lt;ref name="actors" /&gt; On a dare from one of his friends, he participated in a comedy night at [[Mark Ridley's Comedy Castle]] in [[Royal Oak, Michigan|Royal Oak]], a suburb of Detroit. While in Detroit he began to get recognition appearing in local television commercials and appearing on cable comedy shows such as Gary Thison's ''Some Semblance of Sanity''. He moved to Los Angeles and became a regular performer at [[The Comedy Store]]. He began to do stand-up appearances on late-night talk shows and specials on record and film.&lt;ref name="actors" /&gt;

Despite his admitted limited acting range (he once told a magazine his range as an actor is "strictly limited. I can only play a part if I can draw on personal experience, and that well can go dry pretty quickly"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Tim Allen: 'Home' is where the heart is |date= April–May 1996 |url= http://www.midtod.com/9603/allen.phtml |magazine= Midwest Today Magazine |accessdate= May 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allen rose to fame in acting with the [[American Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] [[sitcom]] ''[[Home Improvement (TV series)|Home Improvement]]'' (1991–1999) produced for ABC by Wind Dancer Productions, a company he co-founded with producer [[Carmen Finestra]]. Allen played the main character [[Tim Taylor (character)|Tim "The Tool-Man" Taylor]].&lt;ref name="actors" /&gt; In November 1994, he simultaneously starred in the highest-grossing film ([[Disney]]'s ''[[The Santa Clause]]''), topped the ''New York Times'' best-seller list with his book ''Don't Stand Too Close to a Naked Man'', and appeared in the top rated television series (''Home Improvement'') within the span of one week.&lt;ref name="actors" /&gt; ''Home Improvement'' ran until 1999, for which he was paid US$1.25 million per episode.

In 1995, Allen provided the voice of [[Buzz Lightyear]] in the Disney/[[Pixar]] blockbuster ''[[Toy Story]]''.&lt;ref name="actors" /&gt; In 1997, he starred in the family comedy ''[[Jungle 2 Jungle]]'' from Disney. The next year he returned to voice Buzz Lightyear in ''[[Toy Story 2]]'' which was a financial and critical hit. Also, in 1999 he starred in the sci-fi parody ''[[Galaxy Quest]]'' alongside [[Sigourney Weaver]], [[Alan Rickman]], and [[Sam Rockwell]].

In 2002, he reprised his role as Scott Calvin in ''[[The Santa Clause 2]]''. Two years later, he starred as Luther Krank in ''[[Christmas with the Kranks]]''. In 2006, ''[[Zoom (2006 film)|Zoom]]'' was released, starring Allen as Jack Shepard. The same year, he also starred in ''[[The Shaggy Dog (2006 film)|The Shaggy Dog]]'' and ''[[The Santa Clause 3]]''.

Allen began narrating the "[[Pure Michigan]]" television and radio commercials for the "Travel Michigan" agency. These commercials can be seen and heard throughout the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] and began airing nationally in 2009.&lt;ref name="Pure Michigan Blog"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tim Allen and Pure Michigan|url=http://www.michigan.org/blog/pure-michigan-ads/pure-michigan-tim-allen/|website=michigan.org|accessdate=March 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2009, he started a preview tour of ''[[Crazy on the Outside]]'', a film that debuted in January 2010. Allen accompanied the film, helping promote it with a series of stand-up acts beforehand. During the performances, he told audiences that he planned a 2010 comedy tour. Allen also directed the film, marking his film directorial debut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.timallen.com/?xpt=1|title = Stand Up and Show It Tour Dates|  publisher=TimAllen.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allen hosted the [[TV Land Award|8th Annual TV Land Awards]] on April 25, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news-briefs.ew.com/2010/03/30/tim-allen-to-host-tv-land-awards/|title=Tim Allen to Host TV Land Awards|last=Ward|first=Kate |date=March 30, 2010|work=News Briefs| publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=March 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, he became the official voice of the [[Chevrolet Cruze]], narrating commercials for the vehicle, and he became the voice of Campbell Soup's "It's Amazing What Soup Can Do" campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.brandchannel.com/home/post/2010/09/07/Campbell-Soup-Repositions.aspx| title=Campbell's Soup Shirks Canned Cool for Wholesome Warmth| last=Brady| first=Shirley| date=September 7, 2010| work=brandchannel| accessdate=January 23, 2011| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100913012153/http://www.brandchannel.com/home/post/2010/09/07/Campbell-Soup-Repositions.aspx| archivedate=September 13, 2010| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Allen returned to ABC with the sitcom ''[[Last Man Standing (U.S. TV series)|Last Man Standing]]'' (2011–2017). He played the role of Mike Baxter, a [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] father fighting for his manhood in a house filled with women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.tvguide.com/News/Tim-Allen-ABC-1029665.aspx|title=Tim Allen to Join ABC's The Last Days of Man |website= tvguide.com| accessdate=February 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character is loosely based on his own life, as a Republican father of three girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freebeacon.com/culture/tim-allen-im-what-they-call-fiscal-conservative/| title=Tim Allen: 'I'm What They Call Fiscal Conservative' - Washington Free Beacon| work=Washington Free Beacon}}&lt;/ref&gt; After six seasons, the show was cancelled in May 2017. ABC Entertainment Chief [[Channing Dungey]] denied claims of political bias against Allen, explaining that the network simply could not accommodate the program on their schedule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ABC Is Reiterating Its Claim That 'Last Man Standing' Wasn't Canceled Because Of Tim Allen's Politics|url=https://moviepilot.com/p/abc-chief-repeats-last-man-standing-not-canceled-tim-allen-politics/4342445|website=MoviePilot.com|publisher=[[Moviepilot]]|accessdate=September 6, 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170906225533/https://moviepilot.com/p/abc-chief-repeats-last-man-standing-not-canceled-tim-allen-politics/4342445|archivedate=September 6, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly before the cancellation of ''Last Man Standing'', Allen had been announced as part of the cast of the [[Netflix]] original comedy film ''[[El Camino Christmas]]'' (2017).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Busch|first1=Anita|title=‘Hidden Figures’ Filmmaker Ted Melfi Lines Up Strong Ensemble Cast For ‘El Camino Christmas’ At Netflix|url=http://deadline.com/2017/04/tim-allen-vincent-donofrio-el-camino-christmas-ted-melfi-hidden-figures-filmmaker-netflix-1202076503/|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|accessdate=September 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was paroled on June 12, 1981, after serving two years and four months in [[Federal Correctional Institution, Sandstone]] in [[Sandstone, Minnesota]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.mackinac.org/article.aspx?ID=35| title = 650-Lifer Punishment Is a Crime| publisher = Mackinac Center for Public Policy| author=Pratt, Monica| date=March 3, 1997|accessdate=January 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="official-site-press-rel-coc"&gt;{{cite news |last= Connelly |first= Chris |title= Broken Home |magazine= Ladies' Home Journal |date= April 1997|url= http://www.timallen.com/actor/press_archive/ladies.php| via= timallen.com |accessdate= September 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tim Allen: From Convicted Drug Dealer to Hollywood Star| url=http://investigation.discovery.com/investigation/where-now/allen/tim-allen.html| work=Investigation Discovery| publisher=Discovery| accessdate=September 25, 2010| first=Gary C. |last= King}}&lt;/ref&gt;
