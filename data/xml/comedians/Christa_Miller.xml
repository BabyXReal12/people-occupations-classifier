'''Christa Beatrice Miller''' (born May 28, 1964) is an [[United States|American]] [[actress]] who has achieved success in [[television comedy]]. Her foremost roles include [[Kate O'Brien (The Drew Carey Show)|Kate O'Brien]] on ''[[The Drew Carey Show]]'' and [[Jordan Sullivan]] on ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]'' (which was created by her husband [[Bill Lawrence (producer)|Bill Lawrence]]). She has also appeared in ''[[Seinfeld]]'', ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]'' and ''[[CSI: Miami]]''. From 2009 to 2015, she starred in the [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] (formerly [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]) sitcom ''[[Cougar Town]]'', also created by Lawrence.

==Early life==
Miller was born in [[Manhattan]], and attended the [[Convent of the Sacred Heart (New York City)|Convent of the Sacred Heart]]. She is the daughter of Bonnie Trompeter, and a niece of actress [[Susan Saint James]] and [[NBC Sports]] executive [[Dick Ebersol]]. She has a sister and a brother, John. Miller was a [[child modeling|model]] as a child, appearing in a [[Wonder Bread]] commercial when she was six months old, posing at three for [[Francesco Scavullo]] in an [[Ivory (soap)|Ivory]] soap advertisement, and being photographed for the cover of ''[[Redbook]]''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} Her days as a child model were curtailed after an operation for a benign [[bone tumor]]. After attending Convent of the Sacred Heart, she returned briefly to modeling, but soon took acting lessons, and gave up modeling when she moved to [[Los Angeles, California]], in 1990.&lt;ref name="nydn1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/1996/09/15/1996-09-15_growing_up_was_a_real_soap_o.html |title=Growing up was a real soap opera sitcom star Christa Miller says her mother was the model mom |last=Slewinski |first=Christy |date=September 15, 1996 |publisher=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]] |accessdate=23 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100315120204/http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/1996/09/15/1996-09-15_growing_up_was_a_real_soap_o.html |archivedate=15 March 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was cover model and had a pictorial in the first U.S. edition of ''[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]]''.

==Career==
Miller's first role on television was in ''[[Kate &amp; Allie]]'', which starred her real-life aunt, [[Susan Saint James]], whom she resembles. She then appeared in episodes of ''[[Northern Exposure]]'', ''[[Fresh Prince of Bel Air]]'', and ''[[Party of Five]]''. She had a small role in the horror film ''[[Stepfather III]]'' (1992) with [[Priscilla Barnes]]. Miller later appeared twice on ''[[Seinfeld]]'', as two different characters. In the 1993 episode "[[The Sniffing Accountant]]", she played the boss of [[George Costanza]]. She had intended to be a dramatic actress, and this role proved to be a turning point for Miller, who realized how much she enjoyed comedy. Two years later, she returned to ''Seinfeld'' in "[[The Doodle]]" to play George's girlfriend, Paula. This episode proved to be a boon to her career, as she convinced co-creator [[Larry David]] to provide her with a rough-cut video of the still-unaired episode when she auditioned for ''[[The Drew Carey Show]]'', whose producers had initially thought she was too inexperienced. David's support helped Miller win over the producers of ''The Drew Carey Show'',&lt;ref&gt;Rizzo, Carita. "Before They Were Stars", ''[[TV Guide]]'', January 3, 2011, page 23&lt;/ref&gt; who cast her as [[Kate O'Brien (The Drew Carey Show)|Kate O'Brien]],&lt;ref name="nyt1" /&gt; whom she played from 1995 to 2002.

In 2001, Miller's husband, writer-producer [[Bill Lawrence (producer)|Bill Lawrence]], conceived a new [[comedy-drama]], ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]''. Miller was given a guest role as [[Dr. Cox]]'s ([[John C. McGinley]]) acerbic ex-wife [[Jordan Sullivan]]. Originally, the character was intended to appear in only one episode; in season 2, the role became recurring. When her young cousin Teddy Ebersol, son of [[Susan St. James]] and [[Dick Ebersol]], died in a plane crash in 2004, ''Scrubs'' dedicated the season-4 episode "[[My Lucky Charm (Scrubs)|My Lucky Charm]]" to him. Miller also was the voice of [[Cleopatra (Clone High)|Cleopatra]] in the short-lived animated show ''[[Clone High]]''. She had a leading role in the 2008 two-part TV miniseries ''[[The Andromeda Strain (miniseries)|The Andromeda Strain]]''. She also appeared in the ''[[CSI: Miami]]'' episode ''[[Divorce Party (CSI: Miami)|Divorce Party]]'' .

In 2009, Miller began starring on ''[[Cougar Town]]'', a sitcom created and produced by her husband and starring [[Courteney Cox]], with whom Miller worked in a three-part story-arc of season 8 of ''Scrubs''.
