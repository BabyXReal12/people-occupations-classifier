After continuing to receive racial comments towards her, Jones announced that she would be leaving Twitter on July 18, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fisher|first=Lucina|title='Ghostbusters' Star Leslie Jones Quits Twitter After Online Harassment|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/ghostbusters-star-leslie-jones-quits-twitter-online-harassment/story?id=40698459|accessdate=July 20, 2016|publisher=[[ABC News]]|date=July 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jones appeared later in the week on ''[[Late Night with Seth Meyers]]'', in which she described the ordeal and her meeting with Twitter CEO [[Jack Dorsey]]. Responding to Yiannopoulos's claim that he was targeted for being a "gay conservative", Jones stated, "Free speech and hate speech [are] two different things".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbc.com/late-night-with-seth-meyers/video/leslie-jones-on-her-twitter-trolls/3072412|title=Leslie Jones on Her Twitter Trolls|date=July 22, 2016|publisher=[[NBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly a month later, Jones was again the subject of numerous online attacks. Her personal website was hacked, with its contents being replaced by photos of her driver's license and passport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/leslie-jones-website-hacked-article-1.2764043?cid=bitly|title=Leslie Jones’ website hacked, exposing nude photos, personal info|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site was also made to display alleged nude photographs of Jones, as well as a video tribute to [[killing of Harambe|Harambe]], the Cincinnati Zoo gorilla killed in May 2016 (a reference to the racially charged gorilla remarks directed at Jones in the earlier attack). Jones' team took the website down shortly after it was hacked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/08/24/the-hacking-of-leslie-jones-exposes-misogynoir-at-its-worst.html|title=The Hacking of Leslie Jones Exposes Misogynoir at Its Worst|first=Amy|last=Zimmerman|date=August 25, 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both incidents resulted in large outpourings of celebrity and fan support, via the hashtag "#LoveForLeslieJ", which trended on both Twitter and Instagram.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vibe.com/2016/07/love-for-leslie-j-twitter-trends/|title=#LoveForLeslieJ Trends On Twitter After "Ghostbusters" Backlash|date=July 20, 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Paul Feig]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ledbetter|first1=Carly|title=Celebrities Rally Around Leslie Jones After Vicious Internet Hack|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/celebrities-rally-around-leslie-jones-after-vicious-internet-hack_us_57bdee81e4b04193420ce577|accessdate=August 31, 2016|work=The Huffington Post|date=August 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gabourey Sidibe]], [[Ellen DeGeneres]], [[Sara Benincasa]], [[Ava DuVernay]], [[Hillary Clinton]], [[Corey Taylor]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Yee|first1=Lawrence|title=Leslie Jones Hack: Celebrities Come to Her Defense|url=https://variety.com/2016/digital/news/leslie-jones-hack-reaction-twitter-katy-perry-paul-feig-1201843942/|accessdate=August 31, 2016|work=Variety|date=August 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Katy Perry]], [[Octavia Spencer]], [[Anna Kendrick]], [[Lena Dunham]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=O'Malley|first1=Katie|title=Celebrities Come Out To Support Leslie Jones Following Hacking|url=http://www.elleuk.com/life-and-culture/elle-voices/news/a31646/celebrities-come-out-to-support-leslie-jones-following-hacking/|accessdate=August 31, 2016|work=Elle|date=August 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Loni Love]] expressed solidarity with Jones.
