'''Bernard John Manning''' (13 August 1930 – 18 June 2007) was an English&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pr-inside.com/controversial-british-comedian-bernard-manning-r157083.htm |title=Controversial British comedian Bernard Manning dies at 76 |date=18 June 2007 |accessdate=19 June 2007 |author=PR-inside.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007225403/http://www.pr-inside.com/controversial-british-comedian-bernard-manning-r157083.htm |archivedate=7 October 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/world-news/europe/racerow-comedian-bernard-manning-dies-704824.html|title=Race-row comedian Bernard Manning dies|work=The Independent |location=UK|date=19 June 2007|accessdate=19 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; comedian and nightclub owner.

Manning told irreverent jokes about people from all walks of life, but his act was best known for material involving [[ethnic stereotype]]s and [[minority group]]s. This led to frequent criticism that his act was [[racism|racist]], a charge he disputed.

Manning became famous on British television during the 1970s, appearing on shows including ''[[The Comedians (1971 TV series)|The Comedians]]'' and ''[[The Wheeltappers and Shunters Social Club]]''. The controversy surrounding his act meant that Manning was rarely seen on television in the later part of his career, but he continued to perform in theatres and pubs until his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legacy.com/ManchesterEveningNews/DeathNotices.asp?Page=Lifestory&amp;PersonId=89235844|publisher=[[Manchester Evening News]]|title=Family Notices: Bernard Manning |accessdate=18 June 2007 |date=18 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Manning"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6765093.stm|title=Comedy star Bernard Manning dies |date=18 June 2007 |accessdate=18 June 2007|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Manning was born in [[Ancoats]], [[Manchester]]. He had [[Russian Jew]]ish ancestry on his father's side, as well as roots in Ireland, and was brought up a "strict Catholic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.totallyjewish.com/news/national/?content_id=6527 |author=totallyjewish.com |title=Was Bernard a nice Jewish boy? |date=21 June 2007 |accessdate=15 August 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210081816/http://www.totallyjewish.com/news/national/?content_id=6527 |archivedate=10 February 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/smgpubs/access/1290701541.html?dids=1290701541:1290701541&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jun+19%2C+2007&amp;author=&amp;pub=The+Herald&amp;desc=Bernard+Manning&amp;pqatl=google | work=The Herald | title=Bernard Manning | date=19 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He named his house in [[Alkrington]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/pbc/review_areas/Greater_Manchester_Boroughs/images/Manchester_OM_FR.jpg |title=Greater Manchester Ward and Borough map |publisher=[[Boundary Commission for England]] |accessdate=9 April 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070301235519/http://www.statistics.gov.uk/pbc/review_areas/Greater_Manchester_Boroughs/images/Manchester_OM_FR.jpg &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 1 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GM Gazetteer"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gmcro.co.uk/Guides/Gazeteer/gazza.htm |title=Greater Manchester Gazetteer |publisher=Greater Manchester County Record Office |accessdate=20 June 2007|at=Places names – A|archivedate=18 July 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718144214/http://www.gmcro.co.uk/Guides/Gazeteer/gazza.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Shalom]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.markhodkinson.com/pages/journalism_bernard_manning.htm |title=Interview with Bernard Manning |author=Mark Hodkinson |work=The Times |location=UK |date=29 March 1999 |accessdate=18 June 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928131233/http://www.markhodkinson.com/pages/journalism_bernard_manning.htm |archivedate=28 September 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian2006"/&gt; the [[Hebrew]] word for "[[peace]]". He left school aged 14, joined his father's [[greengrocer]]y business, and then worked in a [[Gallaher Group|Gallaher]]'s tobacco factory,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2007280272,00.html ''Bernard Manning – racist in peace''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070621204834/http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2007280272,00.html |date=21 June 2007 }} The Sun, By James Clench &amp; Guy Patrick – 19 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt; before joining the [[British Army]] to do his [[National Service]].&lt;ref name="BBCobit"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/3867363.stm|title=Obituary: Bernard Manning|date=18 June 2007|accessdate=18 June 2007|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like many other comedians of the time (including the cast of ''[[The Goon Show]]''), Manning held little thought of entertainment as a career, until posted to Germany. Guarding [[Nazi Party|Nazi]] war criminals ([[Rudolf Hess]], [[Albert Speer]], and [[Karl Doenitz]]) at [[Spandau Prison]], [[Berlin]], just after the [[Second World War]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6766611.stm|title=Manning penned his own obituary|work=BBC News|date=19 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; he began to sing popular standards to entertain his fellow soldiers and pass the time. This ability led him to put on free shows at the weekends; when he began to charge admission and audiences did not decrease, he realised that there was a possibility of making money from show business.

==Career==
On returning to England, Manning continued to sing professionally, and also worked as a [[Master of Ceremonies|compère]]. He was an effective singer of popular ballads and fronted many big bands in the 1950s, such as the [[Oscar Rabin Band]].&lt;ref name="BM Tele"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/jun/18/guardianobituaries.obituaries1|accessdate=18 June 2007 |work=The Guardian| title=Bernard Manning|location=London|first=Stephen|last=Dixon|date=18 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, he began to introduce humour into his compering. This went down well, and Manning slowly moved from being a singer and compère to a comedian.&lt;ref name="BBCobit"/&gt; After much work in comedy clubs and [[Northern England|northern]] [[working men's club]]s in the 1950s and 1960s, he made his television debut in 1971 on the [[Granada Television|Granada]] comedy show ''[[The Comedians (1971 TV series)|The Comedians]]''.&lt;ref name="BBCobit"/&gt; He compèred ''[[The Wheeltappers and Shunters Social Club]]'', which began in 1974.

By the 1980s, Manning had fallen out of favour with television companies, but his appearances on the northern [[Working Men's Club and Institute Union|Working Men's Club]] circuit continued, playing to packed audiences which he claimed sometimes included people from [[ethnic minority|ethnic minorities]].&lt;ref name="BBCobit"/&gt; Manning never toned down his act, but he had a minor television career revival towards the end of his life, including [[Channel 4]] taking him to [[Mumbai]] to perform.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotsman.com/news/tasteless-bombay-mix-1-1290848 Tasteless Bombay mix], ''[[Scotland on Sunday]]'', 23 June 2003&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2002, he participated in a ''[[Great Lives]]'' programme for [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]]. He chose to honour the Roman Catholic nun, [[Mother Teresa]].&lt;ref name="BBCobit"/&gt; In 2003, Manning was initially reported to have been booked to play a [[British National Party|BNP]] rally. He denied this, telling the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'': "It's a lot of bollocks. I don't know where I'm working. Speak to my agent. I don't know about any BNP nonsense. I would not do it anyway. Do you think I'm fucking barmy?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2007/06/18/5442/bernard_manning_dies |title=Manning to play BNP rally... but he denies the booking |author=Anon |publisher=chortle.co.uk |date=4 August 2003 |accessdate=18 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, he appeared at the 45th birthday party of chef [[Marco Pierre White]], with [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] as one of the members of the audience.&lt;ref name="Guardian2006"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/g2/story/0,3604,982897,00.html|work=The Guardian |location=London |date=23 June 2003|accessdate=18 June 2007|title='It's an act, innit'  |last=Hattenstone|first=Simon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2007, he was ranked 29th on the list of the 100 Greatest Stand Up comedians in a poll conducted by [[Channel 4]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/C/comedy_standups/results/results.html|publisher=Channel 4 |location=UK|title=One hundred greatest stand-ups |accessdate=18 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his later life, although he still toured Britain, he tended to appear most frequently at the Embassy, the club on the [[A664 road|A664]] Rochdale Road. Set up with his father in 1959, Manning owned the club in [[Harpurhey]], Manchester; his son, Bernard Jr., managed it. The club is reputed to have played host to many rising acts, and Manning claimed that [[the Beatles]] performed there early in their career.&lt;ref name="Guardian2006"/&gt;

==Personal life==
Manning's wife, Veronica Finneran, died of a heart attack on 11 November 1986, aged 57. His son Bernard Jr. had already moved out of the family home, so Manning moved back in with his mother. His brother John died in 1944 at the [[Battle of Arnhem]]; in 1995, his elderly mother and two remaining brothers, Jackie and Frank, also died.&lt;ref name="Guardian2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCobit"/&gt;

Manning was a lifelong [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] supporter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://football.guardian.co.uk/News_Story/0,,945827,00.html |title=Bernard Manning |last=Harper|first=Nick|work=guardian.co.uk |location=London |date=16 May 2003 |accessdate=18 June 2007 |publisher=Guardian News and Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the subject of ''[[This Is Your Life (UK TV series)|This Is Your Life]]'' on 27 November 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eofftv.com/t/thi/this_is_your_life_1969_main.htm |title=This Is Your Life (1969–1993) |publisher=Eofftv.com |accessdate=13 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422082302/http://www.eofftv.com/t/thi/this_is_your_life_1969_main.htm |archivedate=22 April 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; For many of his later years, he was a [[Teetotalism|teetotaler]] and a [[diabetic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3123234.stm |title=Carry on drinking?|last=Bayman|first=Hannah|date=19 September 2003|accessdate=19 June 2007|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having been admitted two weeks earlier for a [[kidney]] complaint, Manning died in [[North Manchester General Hospital]] at 3:10 pm on 18 June 2007.&lt;ref name="Manning"/&gt; He was 76.&lt;ref name="MEN2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/s/1009476_bernard_manning_dead.html|publisher=M.E.N.

==Comedy style==
[[Race (classification of human beings)|Race]], [[human sexual behaviour|sex]], and [[religion]] were all part of the material for many of Manning's jokes, and he jokingly admitted to being racist, stating, "Yes [I am racist]. See, some people I like; some people I don't".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Appearance on the Mrs Merton Show (see 6:35)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88kzmOUTqfw|website=Youtube|accessdate=17 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He considered [[tampon]]s and [[disability|disabled people]] unacceptable subjects, although he was challenged on [[Joan Rivers]]'s show by guest [[Rupert Everett]] when he told a joke about a wheelchair user. Manning swiftly responded: "If your brains were dynamite, you wouldn't have enough to blow off your own hat." This left Everett speechless.&lt;ref&gt;'Red Carpets and Other Banana Skins' Rupert Everett 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, two black waitresses at a charity dinner at a hotel in Derbyshire took exception to Manning's act and appealed to an industrial tribunal against the management of the hotel for [[racial discrimination]]. They lost, later to have the decision overturned at appeal, where they won an undisclosed sum.&lt;ref name=independent_obit&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/abuse-on-the-premises-1352192.html | work=The Independent | location=London | title=Abuse on the premises | date=13 November 1996| accessdate=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.exeter.ac.uk/rburnley/empdis/1996IRLR596.html|title=''Burton &amp; Rhule v De Vere Hotels'' |accessdate=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manning felt that the word "[[wog]]" was "a horrible, insulting word I've never used in my life" but defended use of the words "[[nigger]]" and "[[Racial slur|coon]]" as historical terms with legitimate roots.&lt;ref name="BBCobit"/&gt;

Manning's sense of humour often ridiculed the deaths of other famous people. The death of [[Roy Castle]] from lung cancer in 1994 saw Manning tell the following joke: "When Roy Castle's doctor told him that he only had six months to live, he said that he could do it in four!" In 2002, after the death of the [[Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon|Queen Mother]], he said that the royal [[Welsh Corgi|corgi]]s were happy to hear about her death as they would no longer be blamed for urinating on the settee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php?/site/article/3500/ |title=Bernard Manning: the oldest and truest punk in town |publisher=Spiked-online.com |accessdate=13 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manning's detractors criticised his style of humour, with television presenter [[Esther Rantzen]] commenting that "for me, he's always been the villain of comedy".&lt;ref name="sun_obit"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/237921/Bernard-Manning-racist-in-peace.html | work=The Sun | location=London | title=Bernard Manning racist in peace | date=4 October 2007 | accessdate=21 March 2012 | first=James | last=Clench}}&lt;/ref&gt; His family and friends insisted that his controversial ways were all an act. He lived next door to an Indian doctor's family, who have appeared in many newspaper articles over the years to defend Manning as a "perfect gentleman". Satya Rudravajhala, the poet widow of Visveswara Rao Rudravajhala, wrote a eulogy that was published in the local paper, the ''Middleton Guardian'', conveying the family's sentiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://menmedia.co.uk/middletonguardian/news/s/529637_manning_was_no_racist_says_asian_neighbour |title=Manning was no racist, says Asian neighbour |publisher=M.E.N. Media |date=28 June 2007 |accessdate=13 December 2010 |work=Middleton Guardian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016211209/http://menmedia.co.uk/middletonguardian/news/s/529637_manning_was_no_racist_says_asian_neighbour |archivedate=16 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In interviews with journalists, Manning would remind them of his appearance with [[Dean Martin]] in [[Las Vegas]] and meeting [[Elizabeth II|the Queen]]. He claimed to be a great believer in [[family values]] who never swore in front of his mother, stating: "I dragged myself up by my bootlaces. I don't drink or smoke, I don't take drugs. I have never been a womaniser. I was brought up right with good parents and I have never been in trouble or harmed no-one. And I love my family."&lt;ref name="BBCobit"/&gt;

In 2010, [[BBC Four]] commissioned [[Alice Nutter (writer)|Alice Nutter]] to write a biographical drama based on Manning's life. The screenplay was completed but cuts to the channel's budget led to the piece never being filmed.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Bottoms, 'Struggling to be Human', in the programme for the 2013 West Yorkshire Playhouse production ''My Generation''.&lt;/ref&gt;
