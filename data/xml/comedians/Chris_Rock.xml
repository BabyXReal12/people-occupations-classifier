After working as a standup comic and appearing in small film roles, Rock came to wider prominence as a cast member of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in the early 1990s. He went on to more prominent film appearances, with starring roles in ''[[Down to Earth (2001 film)|Down to Earth]]'' (2001), ''[[Head of State (film)|Head of State]]'' (2003), ''[[The Longest Yard (2005 film)|The Longest Yard]]'' (2005), the [[Madagascar (franchise)|''Madagascar'' film series]] (2005–2012), ''[[Grown Ups (film)|Grown Ups]]'' (2010), its sequel ''[[Grown Ups 2]]'' (2013), ''[[Top Five]]'' (2014), and a series of acclaimed comedy specials for [[HBO]]. He developed, wrote, and narrated the sitcom ''[[Everybody Hates Chris]]'' (2005–2009), which was based on his early life.

In the fall of 2005, the [[UPN]] television network premiered a comedy series called ''[[Everybody Hates Chris]]'', loosely based on Rock's school days, of which he is the executive producer and narrator. The show has garnered both critical and ratings success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Icon Chris Rock|url=http://www.maximonline.com/articles/index.aspx?a_id=7480&amp;src=maxim_ed |publisher=[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]]| date=April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The series was nominated for a 2006 [[Golden Globe]] for Best TV Series (Musical or Comedy), a 2006 [[People's Choice Award]] for Favorite New Television Comedy, and two 2006 [[Emmy Awards]] for costuming and cinematography.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} He produced the series ''[[Totally Biased with W. Kamau Bell]]'', which premiered in August 2012.

===Academy Awards===
In early 2005, Rock hosted the [[77th Academy Awards]] ceremony. The decision to have Rock host the awards was seen by some as a chance to bring an "edge" to the ceremony, and to make it more relevant or appealing to younger audiences. Jokingly, Rock opened by saying ''"Welcome to the 77th and LAST Academy Awards!"'' During one segment Rock asked, "Who is this guy?" in reference to actor [[Jude Law]] seemingly appearing in every movie Rock had seen that year and implied Law was a low-rent [[Tom Cruise]] (he made a joke about filmmakers rushing production when unable to get the actors they want: "If you want [[Tom Cruise]] and all you can get is [[Jude Law]], wait [to make the film]!"). Subsequently, a defensive [[Sean Penn]] took the stage to present and said, "In answer to our host's question, Jude Law is one of our finest young actors." (At the time, Penn and Law were shooting ''[[All the King's Men (2006 film)|All the King's Men]]''.) Law was not the only actor that Rock poked fun at that evening, however—he turned the joke on himself at one point, saying, "If you want [[Denzel Washington|Denzel]] [Washington] and all you can get is me, wait!" Older Oscar officials were reportedly displeased with Rock's performance, which did not elevate ratings for the ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/film/2005/mar/02/awardsandprizes.oscars2005 "Chris Rock effect fails to boost Oscars"; ''[[The Guardian Unlimited]]''; March 2, 2005] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113094616/http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2005/mar/02/awardsandprizes.oscars2005 |date=November 13, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rock was also criticized for referring to the Oscars as "idiotic", and asserting that heterosexual men do not watch them, in an interview prior to Oscar night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6849862/|title=Hey, Chris Rock: Shut the [bleep] up|date=February 3, 2005|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/news/Oscars-2005/Chris-Rock-Oscars-host-slams-Oscars/2005/02/16/1108500124826.html "Chris Rock, Oscars host, slams Oscars"; ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]''/[[Reuters]]; February 16, 2005] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130923063025/http://www.smh.com.au/news/Oscars-2005/Chris-Rock-Oscars-host-slams-Oscars/2005/02/16/1108500124826.html |date=September 23, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 21, 2015 the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] announced Rock would host the [[88th Academy Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-34591581|title=Chris Rock to host 2016 Oscars|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the subsequent acting nominations turned out to include no racial minorities, Rock was called upon to join a boycott of the ceremony. Rock declined however, stating at the ceremony that it would have accomplished little since the show would have proceeded anyway, with him simply replaced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Abad-Santos|first1=Alex|title=Oscars 2016: Chris Rock dismisses Oscars boycotts in a surprising, political monologue|url=https://www.vox.com/2016/2/28/11130954/oscars-2016-chris-rock-monologue|accessdate=29 February 2016|publisher=Vox|date=29 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Rock spoke of his concerns about the lack of diversity in AMPAS at various times during the show, closing by saying "[[Black Lives Matter]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Hollywood IS racist': Chris Rock skewers his Oscars audience and killer cops in rip-roaring monologue but saves his real scorn for the boycott brigade|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3468716/Hollywood-racist-Chris-Rock-skewers-Oscar-s-audience-killer-cops-rip-roaring-monologue-saves-real-scorn-boycott-brigade.html#ixzz41aRuGa63|accessdate=29 February 2016|publisher=Daily Mail|date=29 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music videos===
Rock's first music video was for his song "Your Mother's Got a Big Head" from his album ''Born Suspect''. Rock also made videos for his songs "Champagne" from ''Roll With the New'' and "[[No Sex (In the Champagne Room)]]" from ''Bigger &amp; Blacker''.

He directed and appeared in the music video for the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] song "[[Hump de Bump]]", and has simply appeared in several videos, including the [[Big Daddy Kane]] music video "Smooth Operator" as a guy getting his hair cut, one of the many celebrities seen [[lip-synch]]ing in [[Johnny Cash]]'s "[[God's Gonna Cut You Down]]", and a cameo in [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s "[[Bitch I'm Madonna]]".

===Stage plays===
In 2011, Rock appeared on Broadway in [[Stephen Adly Guirgis]]' play ''[[The Motherfucker with the Hat]]''&lt;ref name="NYTimes Hat announce"&gt;Healy, Patrick. [http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/22/chris-rock-is-ringed-in-by-broadways-hat/ "Chris Rock Takes On Broadway in ‘Hat’"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140105215931/http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/22/chris-rock-is-ringed-in-by-broadways-hat/ |date=January 5, 2014 }}, ''The New York Times'' blog, October 22, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Bobby Cannavale]] and [[Annabella Sciorra]].&lt;ref name="NYTimes Hat announce" /&gt;  Rock was nominated for a Drama League Award. In an interview with Vibe Magazine, Rock stated that he chose to do Broadway because he wanted more people to see him "really act. Sometimes when you do comedy, that can be a little formulaic, and it's hard for really good directors to see that you can act." &lt;ref name="Vibe"&gt;Osorio, Kim. [http://www.vibe.com/2012/01/v-exclusive-chris-rocks-school-rock-interview-pg2/ "V Exclusive! Chris Rock's 'School Of Rock' Interview"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160921124316/http://www.vibe.com/2012/01/v-exclusive-chris-rocks-school-rock-interview-pg2/ |date=September 21, 2016 }}, "Vibe" January 24, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comedic style and views==
Rock's subject matter typically involves family, politics, romance, music, [[Social class|class relationships]], and [[race relations]] in the United States. Though not strictly autobiographical, much of his comic standpoint seems rooted in his teenage experience; his strict parents, concerned about the inadequacies of the local school system, arranged to have the adolescent Rock [[desegregation busing|bused]] to a nearly all-white high school in [[Bensonhurst]] (an Italian-ethnic neighborhood of Brooklyn known at the time for poor race relations). In his memoir ''Rock This'', the comedian recalls, "My parents assumed I'd get a better education in a better neighborhood. What I actually got was a worse education in a worse neighborhood. And a whole bunch of ass-whippings."&lt;ref&gt;Rock, Chris. ''Rock This'' Hyperion, 1997, p. 46. "I got bused from Bed-Stuy to a white school in a poor white neighborhood: Gerretson Beach, Brooklyn... What I actually got was a worse education in a worse neighborhood..."&lt;/ref&gt;

The comedian has also expressed discomfort with the notion that success in standup comedy—or, indeed, in any aspect of the entertainment industry—should oblige him to serve as a [[role model]]. In this position, he finds himself directly at odds with one of his comic idols, [[Bill Cosby]]. Cosby has reprimanded Rock both explicitly—for his [[Niggas vs. Black People]] track—and implicitly, for heavy use of the word "nigger."&lt;ref&gt;Morano, Marc. CNSNews. "Bill Cosby to Blacks," July 2, 2004. "When you put on a record, and that record is yelling 'nigger this' and 'nigger that' and cursing all over the thing and you got your little six-year-old and seven-year-old sitting in the back seat of the car—those children hear that... That's all minstrel show stuff. I am tired of it."&lt;/ref&gt; Rock has not wavered from a position explored in his 1996 ''Roll With The New'' show, and reiterated in his 1997 memoir: "Why does the public expect entertainers to behave better than everybody else? It's ridiculous...Of course, this is just for black entertainers. You don't see anyone telling [[Jerry Seinfeld]] he's a good role model. Because everyone expects whites to behave themselves...Nowadays, you've got to be an entertainer and a leader. It's too much."&lt;ref&gt;Rock, Chris. ''Rock This''; Hyperion, 1997, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Often the subject of [[tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloids]], when asked about [[paparazzi]] and the other negative aspects of [[celebrity|fame]], Rock says he accepts the bad with the good: "You can't be happy that fire cooks your food and be mad it burns your fingertips."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Everybody Loves Chris |url=http://www.craveonline.com/humor/articles/04647576/everybody_loves_chris.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927200018/http://www.craveonline.com/humor/articles/04647576/everybody_loves_chris.html |archivedate=September 27, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the London [[Live Earth concert, London|Live Earth]] concert on July 7, 2007, which was broadcast live on the BBC, before introducing the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], Rock called the crowd "[[motherfucker]]s" and "shit" after a brief sigh when he said he was joking. Due to the broadcast being at 5:45&amp;nbsp;pm Rock was immediately cut off, and the BBC made several apologies for his use of the word "motherfucker."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/live-earth/29530|title=Chris Rock defends Live Earth swearing - NME.COM|first=|last=NME.COM|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chris Rock has been an avid fan of the [[New York Mets]] baseball team since childhood. He famously complained that his team "had no money" in a comedic rant during a 2011 interview with David Letterman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chris Rock Complains About The Mets On Letterman (VIDEO)|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/04/01/chris-rock-mets-letterman_n_843579.html

==Influences==
Rock's comedy influences are [[Bill Cosby]], [[Redd Foxx]], [[Dick Gregory]], [[Flip Wilson]], [[Richard Pryor]], [[Steve Martin]], [[Pigmeat Markham]], [[Woody Allen]], [[Eddie Murphy]],&lt;ref name="RockBTP1996"&gt;{{cite video| title = [[Chris Rock: Bring the Pain]]| medium = TV| publisher = [[HBO]]|date = 1996}}{{Page needed|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sam Kinison]], [[George Carlin]], [[Mort Sahl]],&lt;ref name="ew"/&gt; and [[Rodney Dangerfield]].&lt;ref name="JRoss2008"&gt;{{cite episode|title=|series = Friday Night with Jonathan Ross|serieslink= Friday Night with Jonathan Ross|network=BBC One|airdate = January 11, 2008| season=14 | episode=1}} [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBXCP7AnpwE part 2]&lt;/ref&gt;
