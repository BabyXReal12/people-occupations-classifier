'''David Michael Koechner''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɛ|k|n|ər}} {{respell|KEK|nər}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2013/10/the-face-you-know-an-interview-with-anchormans-dav.html |title=The Face You Know: An Interview with Anchorman's David Koechner|publisher=Paste Magazine |date= |accessdate=2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; born August 24, 1962) is an American actor and comedian, best known for playing roles such as [[Champ Kind]] in the ''[[Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy|Anchorman]]'' films and [[Todd Packer]] on [[NBC]]'s ''[[The Office (US)|The Office]]''.

Koechner first became involved in performing when he began studying improvisational comedy in [[Chicago]] at [[ImprovOlympic]], under the teachings of [[Del Close]], before joining the [[The Second City|Second City Northwest]]. After yearlong stints of doing [[sketch comedy]] on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' and ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'' in the mid 1990s, Koechner began appearing with small roles in the films such as ''[[Wag the Dog]]'', ''[[Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me]]'', and ''[[Man on the Moon (film)|Man on the Moon]]''.

While filming the country [[mockumentary]] film ''[[Dill Scallion]]'' in 1998, Koechner befriended actor/comedian [[Dave 'Gruber' Allen]], and eventually began performing as the comedy duo, ''[[The Naked Trucker &amp; T-Bones Show]]'', a live musical comedy act. The act became a hit at Hollywood clubs such as [[Largo (nightclub)|Largo]], and Allen and Koechner were invited to open for [[Tenacious D]]. In 2007, Koechner and Allen created and starred together in a ''Naked Trucker &amp; T-Bones Show'' [[sketch comedy]] series that ran for one season on [[Comedy Central]]. After his breakout role as [[Champ Kind]] in the 2004 comedy ''[[Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy|Anchorman]]'', Koechner began appearing frequently with larger supporting roles in many high-profile comedic films including ''[[Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby|Talladega Nights]]'', ''[[Thank You for Smoking (film)|Thank You for Smoking]]'', ''[[Waiting... (film)|Waiting...]]'', ''[[Semi-Pro]]'', ''[[The Goods: Live Hard, Sell Hard]]'', and ''[[Extract (film)|Extract]]''. His first leading film role, as Coach Lambeau Fields in [[Fox Atomic]]'s sports comedy, ''[[The Comebacks]]'' opened on October 19, 2007. More recently, Koechner reprised his role of [[Champ Kind]] for ''[[Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues]]'', co-starred in the horror-comedy ''[[Krampus (film)|Krampus]]'', and received praise from critics for his dark turn in the 2014 [[black comedy]] ''[[Cheap Thrills (film)|Cheap Thrills]]''. He co-starred in the [[CBS]] sitcom ''[[Superior Donuts (TV Series)|Superior Donuts]]'' and currently co-stars on the [[Comedy Central]] series ''[[Another Period]]''.

==Early life==
Koechner was born in [[Tipton, Missouri]], to Margaret Ann (née Downey) and Cecil Stephen Koechner. He has two brothers, Mark and Joe, and three sisters, Mary-Rose, Cecilia and Joan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kcchiefs.com/media-center/videos/Chiefs-Kingdom-David-Koechner/9bb4718b-cc74-420a-88b9-233c11e3edfc Profile], kcchiefs.com; accessed November 17, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; His father ran a business that manufactured turkey coops (Koechner has stated that "If you see a turkey going down the road in a big truck, most likely its coop is from Tipton...").&lt;ref name="BIO1"&gt;[https://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800307359/bio David Koechner Biography]; [https://movies.yahoo.com Yahoo!

After studying at Chicago's [[ImprovOlympic]], under famed [[improvisation]] instructor [[Del Close]], Koechner joined [[The Second City]] comedy troupe in Chicago, graduating in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.secondcity.com/?id=history/alumni/northwest The Second City Northwest Alumni], secondcity.com; accessed November 17, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Early career===
In 1995, Koechner landed a year-long stint on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', joining the show with [[The Second City|Second City]] friends [[Nancy Walls]] and [[Adam McKay]]. During his time at SNL, he befriended guest-writer [[David 'Gruber' Allen]], and castmate [[Will Ferrell]]. Some of Koechner's recurring skits included [[Bill Brasky]], the British Fops (playing Fagan, opposite [[Mark McKinney]]), Gary Macdonald (the fictional younger brother of Weekend Update anchor/SNL castmember [[Norm Macdonald]], based on "Jokey", a character he originated at [[The Second City|Second City]]), Will Ferrell's "Get Off the Shed" sketches (playing his neighbor, Tom Taylor), and [[Gerald "T-Bones" Tibbons]]. Koechner impersonated several celebrities, including [[Burt Reynolds]], [[Mike Ditka]], [[Charlie Sheen]], [[Robert Shapiro (lawyer)|Robert Shapiro]], [[Willard Scott]], [[Oliver Stone]], [[Phil Gramm]], [[David Kaczynski]], and [[Pat Buchanan]]. After his one season on SNL, Koechner joined the 1996–97 sketch cast of ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]''.

===Partnership with David "Gruber" Allen===
On the set of the 1999 country music mockumentary, ''[[Dill Scallion]]'', Koechner struck a partnership with SNL friend David "Gruber" Allen, joining Allen's [[improvisational comedy]] act, ''[[The Naked Trucker Show]]''.&lt;ref name="SG"&gt;[http://suicidegirls.com/interviews/David%20Koechner David Koechner], suicidegirls.com; January 16, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Koechner joined the act as Gerald "T-Bones" Tibbons, a character he had been playing on comedy stages for a few years, including a recurring character bit on SNL. Gerald Tibbons dates back to 1995, when he filmed a short television pilot based on the character's misadventures.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCNhmJV589k Video Clip: "Pizza Boy Gerald"]; [https://www.youtube.com/profile?user=SpasticAV Roscoe Entertainment], YouTube.com; accessed November 17, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The "Gerald" character, based on a real drifter named Four-Way George, became so popular that Koechner would go to auditions, only to find that directors were always demanding his stage persona.&lt;ref name="audio"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2007-01-16-naked-trucker_x.htm A convoy of offbeat comedy], usatoday.com, January 16, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The stage act, a mix of stand-up comedy and off-color country songs, became a hit on the Hollywood improv circuit, ultimately landing television performances on ''Late Night with Conan O'Brien'', ''Jimmy Kimmel Live!'' and ''[[Real Time with Bill Maher]]''. ''[[The Naked Trucker and T-Bones Show]]'' toured with fellow comedic musical duo, [[Tenacious D]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archive/2007/03/03-01-07tdc/03-01-07darts-01.asp Q &amp; A: Naked Trucker &amp; T-bone] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713135624/http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archive/2007/03/03-01-07tdc/03-01-07darts-01.asp |date=13 July 2007 }}, collegian.psu.edu; accessed November 17, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===2004–2006===
In 2004, Koechner landed his largest film role up to that point, as sports reporter Champ Kind in ''[[Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy]]''. As part of the ''Anchorman'' ensemble, Koechner shared two [[MTV Movie Awards 2005|MTV Movie Award]] nominations for ''Best On-Screen Team'' and ''Best Musical Performance''. MTV's initial press release accidentally listed [[Fred Armisen]] instead of David Koechner, but eventually corrected the error on their website, crediting Koechner during the broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtv.co.uk/channel/mtvuk/news/its_the_2005_mtv_movie_awards_nominees It's the 2005 MTV Movie Awards Nominees!], mtv.co.uk; May 4, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1501233/05042005/story.jhtml "Vicious Teens And Happy Drunk Lead 2005 MTV Movie Awards Nominees"], mtv.com; accessed November 17, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Following this role, he landed small and supporting roles in such films such ''[[The 40-Year-Old Virgin]]'', ''[[Talladega Nights]]'', ''[[The Dukes of Hazzard (film)|The Dukes of Hazzard]]'' and ''[[Snakes on a Plane]]''. In 2006, he made his voice acting debut in ''[[Barnyard (film)|Barnyard]]'' as "Dag". That same year, he had a supporting role as a gun lobbyist in the critically acclaimed satire, ''[[Thank You for Smoking (film)|Thank You for Smoking]]''. The three actors portrayed lobbyists for the tobacco, alcohol, &amp; gun industries, dubbed The M.O.D. (Merchants of Death) Squad. ''Thank You for Smoking'' was one of the best-reviewed films of Koechner's career, and he was included in [[Fox Searchlight]]'s [[For Your Consideration (advertising)|Oscar campaign]], among the film's listings for Best Supporting Actor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://defamer.com/hollywood/awards/for-your-consideration-everyone-but-katie-holmes-214399.php For Your Consideration: Everyone But Katie Holmes], defamer.com, November 13, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

After co-starring in ''Anchorman'' and ''The 40-Year-Old Virgin'', fellow Second City alum [[Steve Carell]] personally recommended Koechner for a recurring role on [[NBC]]'s ''[[The Office (US)|The Office]]'', playing [[Todd Packer]].&lt;ref name="DVD"&gt;[[DVD-Audio|DVD audio]] commentary from The Office: Season 2, Episode #8 (202) ''[[Sexual Harassment (The Office episode)|"Sexual Harassment"]]'' – published by [[Universal Studios Home Entertainment]] on September 12, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Koechner's role is the American version of [[Chris Finch]] from the [[The Office (UK TV series)|original]]. Packer is an obnoxious, alcoholic best friend of [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Carell's character]]. Koechner guest-starred, both in person and voice, on fifteen episodes of the series. His frequent work with actors Ferrell, Carell, [[Jack Black]], and [[Ben Stiller]] have led some critics and journalists to point out his association with the media-dubbed "[[Frat Pack]]". David had a guest starring role as Uncle Earl in an episode on ''[[Hannah Montana]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2005-08-11-steve-carell_x.htm?POE=LIFISVA Carell just wants some love], August 11, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com Profile], usatoday.com; accessed November 17, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.joblo.com/index.php?id=10340 Talladega trailer], joblo.com, February 13, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===2007&amp;ndash;present===
In 2007, Koechner was seen in his first leading role in ''[[The Comebacks]]'' (which opened on October 19), the first comedy to be released under [[Fox Searchlight]]'s [[Fox Atomic]] division.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, Gabriel; Laporte, Nicole. [http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117950627.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1 "Brady at QB for Atomic; Helmer tackles 'Comebacks'"], ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', September 24, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; He played a college football coach with the worst record in the history of the sport who vows to turn things around with his new team of ragtag recruits. He described this career opportunity as the "first lead for the right-hander."&lt;ref name="SG"/&gt; Veteran actor [[Carl Weathers]] played Koechner's rival coach. Though Koechner, who usually writes and improvises his material, had no involvement with the screenplay, he complimented director [[Tom Brady (film director)|Tom Brady]] for taking "great care to make it as smart as he could", adding that it is a sports comedy rather than a spoof.&lt;ref name="SG"/&gt;

On January 17, 2007, [[Comedy Central]] premiered ''[[The Naked Trucker and T-Bones Show]]'', a sketch comedy series starring Koechner (as T-Bones) and longtime performing partner [[Dave "Gruber" Allen]] (as The Naked Trucker). The duo performs their unique brand of off-color songs and introduces pre-taped skits. Many of Koechner's past co-stars made [[Cameo appearance|cameo]]s, including Will Ferrell, [[Jack Black]], Steve Carell, [[Andy Richter]], [[Dax Shepard]], and [[Paul Rudd]]. The pre-taped skits gave Koechner more screen time than Allen, often letting him showcase his comedic charisma alongside guest stars like Richter and Shepard. Comedy Central  ordered eight episodes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/naked_trucker/press_releases/naked_trucker_press_release.jhtml Comedy Central Announces The Series Pick-Up Of The Torrid, Twisted Tales Of "The Naked Trucker And T-Bones Show"]; Comedy Central, March 27, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the eight years Koechner &amp; Allen have been playing these characters, there have been several attempts to bring the act to television, but they had trouble figuring how to translate it into a series.&lt;ref name="audio"&gt;[http://www.maximumfun.org/blog/2007/01/podcast-david-koechner-dave-gruber.html Podcast: David Koechner &amp; Dave "Gruber" Allen on The Naked Trucker &amp; T-Bones Show], [http://www.maximumfun.org/index.htm The Sound of Young America] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070207132811/http://www.maximumfun.org/index.htm |date=7 February 2007 }}, maximumfun.org; January 12, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Koechner &amp; Allen's first album, ''Naked Trucker and T-Bones Live at the Troubador'', was released March 20, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000G6BL24 Live at the Troubadour (LIVE)], Amazon.com; accessed November 17, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Koechner co-starred with [[Luke Wilson]] in the 2009 indie-comedy ''[[Tenure (film)|Tenure]]'' and was a lead in the 2012 horror film ''[[Piranha 3DD]]''. Koechner returned as [[Champ Kind]], in ''[[Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues]]'' (2013). {{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

Following the release of ''Live at the Troubador'', Koechner revealed that a T-Bones film is in development with Will Ferrell and [[Adam McKay]]'s [[Gary Sanchez Productions]].&lt;ref&gt;MacIntyre, April. [http://music.monstersandcritics.com/features/article_1280355.php/M&amp;C_Interview_David_Koechner_T-bones_The_Naked_Trucker_and_Live_At_The_Troubadour M&amp;C Interview: David Koechner/T-Bones, The Naked Trucker and 'Live At The Troubadour'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070505122204/http://music.monstersandcritics.com/features/article_1280355.php/M%26C_Interview_David_Koechner_T-bones_The_Naked_Trucker_and_Live_At_The_Troubadour |date=5 May 2007 }};  Monsters &amp; Critics; March 20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Koechner wrote the script with veteran television writer/producer [[Norm Hiscock]], who also wrote for ''The Naked Trucker and T-Bones Show'', in addition to past work on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', ''[[The Kids in the Hall]]'', and ''[[King of the Hill]]''. He made his first return guest appearance to ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' on December 7, 2013 with his fellow ''[[Anchorman]]'' co-stars [[Will Ferrell]], [[Steve Carell]], and the episode's host, [[Paul Rudd]]. The ''Anchorman'' stars sang "[[Afternoon Delight]]" with the episode's musical guest [[One Direction]] during the opening monologue. Koechner and Ferrell also reprised their [[Bill Brasky]] sketch in the same episode.

In 2015, Koechner began co-starring as Commodore Bellacourt in the [[Comedy Central]] series ''[[Another Period]]''. He also currently recurs as Bill Lewis on ''[[The Goldbergs (2013 TV series)|The Goldbergs]]''.

In a contrast to his largely comedy-based acting career, Koechner starred in the 2016 drama ''[[Priceless (2016 film)|Priceless]]'', a film about [[human trafficking]]. He said of the role, "My wife and I have five kids — three of them are daughters. So, just to imagine the horror of any young lady having to go through this. This film is based on true events. It’s happening right now. It’s happening in Chicago. It’s happening here in Los Angeles. It’s happening globally. So, to be a participant in a film like this — to bring awareness to such a horror — makes me happy."&lt;ref&gt;[http://chicago.suntimes.com/entertainment/noted-comedian-david-koechner-turns-dramatic-in-priceless/ Noted comedian David Koechner turns dramatic in ‘Priceless’]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

Koechner performs regularly in Los Angeles at both the ImprovOlympic West theater in the show ''Beer Shark Mice'', and at [[Largo (nightclub)|Largo]], the nightclub where the Naked Trucker Show plays regularly. David Koechner supported the 2004 US Presidential campaign of Senator [[John Kerry]], performing at a June 6, 2004, Hollywood fundraiser for the senator, where ''The Naked Trucker &amp; T-Bones'' opened up for [[Tenacious D]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://concertsforkerry.org/ ConcertsforKerry.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Koechner cites [[Lou Reed]], [[Iggy Pop]], [[The Replacements (band)|The Replacements]], [[Uncle Tupelo]] and its offshoots ([[Wilco]] and [[Son Volt]]) as some of his musical favorites.
