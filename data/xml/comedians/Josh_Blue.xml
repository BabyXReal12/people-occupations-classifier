'''Josh Blue''' (born November 27, 1978) is an [[United States|American]] [[comedian]].  He was voted the Last Comic Standing on [[NBC]]'s reality show ''[[Last Comic Standing]]'' during its [[Last Comic Standing 4|fourth season]], which aired May–August 2006.&lt;ref name="About"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://specialchildren.about.com/b/2006/08/11/josh-blue-wins-last-comic-standing.htm|title=Josh Blue wins "Last Comic Standing"|last=Mauro|first=Terri|date=August 11, 2006|publisher=About.com|accessdate=2009-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blue has [[cerebral palsy]], and much of his self-deprecating humor is centered on this.

==Early life==
Blue was born in [[Cameroon]] where his father, Walter Blue, was a professor of [[Romance languages]] at [[Hamline University]] teaching during a [[Mission (station)|mission]]. Blue grew up in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]], and graduated from [[Como Park Senior High School]] in 1997. He began his career as a comedian while seeking a creative writing degree at [[The Evergreen State College]].&lt;ref name="LCSbiography" /&gt;

During college, he went back to Africa to volunteer as an intern at Parc de Hahn, a zoo in Senegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miusa.org/ncde/stories/blue |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201203753/http://www.miusa.org/ncde/stories/blue |archivedate=2014-02-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At one point for a joke on a busy weekend, Josh locked himself in an empty animal exhibit for 8 hours. A bewildered crowd threw him bananas and peanuts anyway, to which Josh quips "that was the best day I ate in Senegal!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.takemehomepodcast.com/44-josh-blue/|title=44 – Josh Blue - Take Me Home Podcast|work=Take Me Home Podcast|accessdate=3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Blue got his start in comedy doing [[open mic]] sets while attending [[The Evergreen State College]]. Audiences reacted enthusiastically to his self-deprecating humor, and Blue started making a name for himself on the comedy circuit. In 2002, he won the prestigious [[Comedy Works]] New Talent Search contest. He has appeared several times on [[Comedy Central]]'s ''[[Mind of Mencia]]''.&lt;ref name="LCSbiography" /&gt; Blue won $10,000 for finishing in first place at 2004 Las Vegas Comedy Festival's 2004 Royal Flush Comedy Competition.&lt;ref name="LCSbiography" /&gt;

After winning the 2006 season of NBC's reality show ''[[Last Comic Standing]]'',&lt;ref name="About"/&gt; he was the first comedian to do stand-up on ''[[The Ellen DeGeneres Show]]''.&lt;ref name="Zanies" /&gt; His other television credits include ''[[Live with Regis and Kelly]]'', ''[[Comics Unleashed]]'', plus numerous appearances on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], [[CBS]], [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], and [[MSNBC]].&lt;ref name="Zanies" /&gt;

He appeared in the 2009 low-budget horror film ''[[Feast III: The Happy Finish]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2333144/|title=Josh Blue|work=IMDb|accessdate=3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Josh was voted the 13th best comedian by viewers in ''Comedy Central's Stand-up Comedy Showdown 2010''.

Blue appeared in Boulder band [[Rose Hill Drive]]'s music video  "The Psychoanalyst".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66oqIUnvP_E&amp;feature=grec_index|title=Rose Hill Drive - Psychoanalyst featuring Josh Blue|date=7 July 2011|work=YouTube|accessdate=3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Josh Blue.jpg|thumb|left]]

Blue was voted the 11th best comedian by viewers in ''Comedy Central's Stand-up Comedy Showdown 2011''.

He appeared in [[Ron White]]'s ''Las Vegas Salute to the Troops 2013'' as part of the opening act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cmt.com/show/ron_whites_2013_comedy_salute_to_the_troops/series.jhtml | title=Ron White's Vegas Salute to the Troops 2013 | publisher=[[CMT.com]] | accessdate=June 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blue also appeared in the sports based comedy ''108 Stitches'' in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bizjournals.com/denver/blog/cultural_attache/2013/10/meet-denvers-josh-blue-movie-star.html?page=all | title=Meet Denver's Josh Blue, movie star | work=[[Denver Business Journal]] | date=Oct 9, 2013 | accessdate=June 6, 2014 | author=Hicks, L. Wayne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Blue currently resides in [[Denver, Colorado]],&lt;ref name="LCSbiography" /&gt; with his two children: a son, Simon, and a daughter, Seika.

Blue played a part in the 2004 U.S. [[Paralympic Games|Paralympic]] [[Paralympic football|soccer]] team.&lt;ref name="LCSbiography" /&gt; He also creates and sells [[sculptures]] and [[paintings]]. 

Blue has [[cerebral palsy]],&lt;ref name="About" /&gt; specifically classified as spastic hemiplegic cerebral palsy, and many of his jokes center on living with his disability, how he deals with it, and how other people view him.&lt;ref name="LCSbiography"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbc.com/Last_Comic_Standing/comics/josh_blue.shtml|title=Last Comic Standing biography|publisher=[[National Broadcasting Corporation|NBC]]|accessdate=2009-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blue appeared on ''[[Last Comic Standing]]'' to "make people aware of the fact that people with disabilities can make an impact."&lt;ref name="LCSbiography" /&gt; He coined the term "palsy punch" during his final set of the final round of the show, when he said that the palsy punch is effective in a fight because "first of all, they don't know where the punch is coming from, and second of all, neither do I." One of Blue's competitors said he has "an unreasonable amount of likability" while another of his competitors said "he is just a good guy".&lt;ref name="Zanies"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nashville.zanies.com/news.php?NewsSection=Josh+Blue|title=Season 4 WINNER of NBC's "LAST COMIC STANDING"|publisher=Zanies Comedy Night Club|accessdate=2009-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blue also joked that signing an [[autograph]] takes 45 minutes and that to write down his phone number he has to find a "big ol' stack of paper."
