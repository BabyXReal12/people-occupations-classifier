'''Milton Supman''' (January 8, 1926 – October 22, 2009), known professionally as '''Soupy Sales''', was an American comedian, actor, radio/television personality, and jazz aficionado.&lt;ref name="NYTjazz"&gt;{{Cite web|date=October 23, 2009|last=Ratliff|first=Ben|url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/10/23/soupy-sales-jazz-maven-brought-live-gigs-to-the-small-screen/?hp|title= Soupy Sales, Jazz Maven, Brought Gigs to the Small Screen|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=October 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was best known for his local and network [[children's television]] show, ''Lunch with Soupy Sales'' (1953-1966), a series of comedy sketches frequently ending with Sales receiving [[Pieing|a pie in the face]], which became his trademark.

From 1968 to 1975, he was a regular panelist on the syndicated revival of ''[[What's My Line?]]'' and appeared on several other TV game shows. During the 1980s, Sales hosted his own show on [[WNBC (AM)|WNBC-AM]] in New York City.

==Early life and career==
Milton Supman was born in [[Franklinton, North Carolina]], to Irving Supman and Sadie Berman.&lt;ref name="SSB" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Irving Supman was born on July 4, 1890, according to his World War I draft registration&lt;/ref&gt; His father, a Jewish [[dry goods]] merchant, had emigrated from [[Hungary]] in 1894. Sales had three siblings: Marvin Supman (1916–1920), Dr. J. Leonard Supman (1918–1998) of Kingsport, Tennessee, and attorney Jack Supman (1921–2014) of Lancaster, Ohio.&lt;ref name="LEGACY"&gt;[http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/thisweeknews/obituary.aspx?pid=170363515  Obituary for Jack Supman], legacy.com; retrieved July 3, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SSDI"&gt;[http://search.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/sse.dll?gss=angs-c&amp;new=1&amp;rank=1&amp;msT=1&amp;gsfn=leonard&amp;gsln=supman&amp;mswpn__ftp=Kingsport%2c+Hawkins%2c+Tennessee%2c+USA&amp;mswpn=35922&amp;mswpn_PInfo=8-|0|1652393|0|2|3246|45|0|1330|35922|0|&amp;MSAV=0&amp;cp=0&amp;catbucket=rstp&amp;pcat=34&amp;h=60918552&amp;recoff=11+12&amp;db=ssdi&amp;indiv=1&amp;ml_rpos=1 Ancestry.com, Social Security Death Index – Dr. J.

[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/soupy-sales-anarchic-and-pioneering-childrens-tv-personality-1812400.html "Soupy Sales: Anarchic and pioneering children's TV personality"]. ''The Independent''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sales got his nickname from his family. His older brothers had been nicknamed "Ham Bone" and "Chicken Bone." Milton was dubbed "Soup Bone," which was later shortened to "Soupy". When he became a disc jockey, he began using the stage name Soupy Hines. After he became established, it was decided that "Hines" was too close to the Heinz soup company, so he chose Sales, in part after [[vaudeville]] comedian [[Chic Sale]].&lt;ref name="NYTOBIT"&gt;{{Cite web|date= October 23, 2009

Sales graduated from Huntington High School in [[Huntington, West Virginia]] in 1944. He enlisted in the [[United States Navy]] and served on the {{USS|Randall|APA-224}} in the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|South Pacific]] during the latter part of [[World War II]]. He sometimes entertained his shipmates by telling jokes and playing crazy characters over the ship's public address system. One of the characters he created was "White Fang", a large dog that played outrageous practical jokes on the seamen. The sounds for "White Fang" came from a recording of ''[[The Hound of the Baskervilles]]''.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Sales enrolled at [[Marshall University|Marshall College]] in Huntington, WV, where he earned a master's degree in Journalism. While at Marshall, he performed in nightclubs as a comedian, singer and dancer. After graduating, Sales began working as a scriptwriter and [[DJ|disc jockey]] at radio station [[WHTN]] (now [[WVHU]]) in Huntington. He moved to [[Cincinnati, Ohio]] in 1949, where he worked as a morning radio DJ and performed in nightclubs. Sales began his television career on [[WKRC-TV]] in Cincinnati with ''Soupy's Soda Shop'', TV's first teen dance program,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amdest.com/stars/ssales.html ''Soupy's Soda Shop'' details] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140118065708/http://www.amdest.com/stars/ssales.html |date=2014-01-18 }}, amdest.com; accessed August 30, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Club Nothing!'', a late-night comedy/variety program. When WKRC canceled his TV shows, Sales moved to [[Cleveland, Ohio]], where he hosted another radio and TV series on [[WJW-TV]] (Channel 8) and continued his nightclub act. It was in a skit on his late night comedy/variety TV series ''Soupy's On!'' that he got his first pie in the face. Sales claimed he left the Cleveland station "for health reasons: they got sick of me." He relocated to [[Detroit]] in 1953 and worked for [[WXYZ-TV]] (Channel 7), [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s [[O&amp;O]] station.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

==''Lunch with Soupy Sales''==
Sales is best known for his daily children's television show, ''Lunch with Soupy Sales''. The show was originally called ''12 O'Clock Comics'', and was later known as ''The Soupy Sales Show''. Improvised and [[slapstick]] in nature, ''Lunch with Soupy Sales'' was a rapid-fire stream of comedy sketches, gags, and puns, almost all of which resulted in Sales receiving a pie in the face, which became his trademark. Sales developed pie-throwing into an art form: straight to the face, on top of the head, a pie to both ears from behind, moving into a stationary pie, and countless other variations. He claimed that he and his visitors had been hit by more than 20,000 pies during his career.&lt;ref name="NYTOBIT"/&gt; He recounted a time when a young fan mistakenly threw a frozen pie at his neck and he "dropped like a pile of bricks."&lt;ref name="NYTOBIT"/&gt;

===History of the show===

====Detroit====
[[Image:Soupy puppet.jpg|left|thumb|200px|A [[hand puppet]] featuring a likeness of Sales]]
''Lunch with Soupy Sales'' began in 1953 from the studios of [[WXYZ-TV]], Channel 7, located in the historic [[Maccabees Building]], in [[Detroit]]. Sales occasionally took the studio cameras to the lawn of the [[Detroit Public Library]], located across the street from the TV studios, and talked with local students walking to and from school. Beginning no later than July 4, 1955,&lt;ref name="NY Times TV review"&gt;Soupy Sales' debut on New York channel 7 (as a summer replacement for [[Kukla, Fran and Ollie]]) was reviewed on July 5, 1955 (full article may only be available to nytimes.com subscribers) {{cite web|last1=Shanley|first1=J. P.|title=TV: Saved by Shaw|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9804E1DD103AE53BBC4D53DFB166838E649EDE&amp;url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1955/07/05/83362614.html?pageNumber=59|website=New York Times|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=September 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Saturday version of Sales's lunch show was broadcast nationally on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television network.  His lunchtime program on weekdays was moved to early morning opposite ''Today'' and ''Captain Kangaroo.''

During the same period that ''Lunch with Soupy Sales'' aired in Detroit, Sales also hosted a nighttime show, ''Soup's On'', to compete with [[11 O'Clock News]] programs.&lt;ref name="cadence"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Donaldson|first =Bill |date=February 2003|title =Interview with Soupy Sales, December 28, 2001|journal=[[Cadence Magazine]]|volume =29|issue=2|pages=9–12|publisher=Cadnor Ltd.|location=[[Redwood, New York]]|issn=0162-6973}}&lt;/ref&gt; The guest star was always a musician, often a [[jazz]] performer, at a time when jazz was popular in Detroit and the city was home to twenty-four [[jazz club]]s. Sales believed that his show helped sustain jazz in Detroit, as artists would regularly sell out their nightclub shows after appearing on ''Soup's On''.&lt;ref name="cadence"/&gt;

[[Coleman Hawkins]], [[Louis Armstrong]], [[Duke Ellington]], [[Billie Holiday]], [[Charlie Parker]], and [[Stan Getz]] were among the musicians who appeared on the show; [[Miles Davis]] made six appearances.&lt;ref name="NYTjazz"/&gt; [[Clifford Brown]]'s appearance on ''Soup's On'', according to Sales, may be the only extant [[footage]] of Brown, and has been included in ''[[Ken Burns' Jazz]]'' and an [[A&amp;E Network]] biography about Sales.&lt;ref name="cadence"/&gt;

Sales briefly had a third dinner time show filmed largely in the Palmer Park section of Detroit. Sales' three shows were rumored to have earned him in excess of $100,000 per year.  One of his character puppets was Willy the Worm, a "balloon" propelled worm that emerged from its house and used a high pitched voice to announce birthdays or special events on the noontime show; but the character never appeared when Soupy moved to [[Los Angeles]]. In his lunchtime show, Sales always wore an [[orlon]] fabric sweater. In many of his shows, he appeared in costume, performed his dance, the [[Soupy Shuffle]], introduced many characters such as Nicky Nooney, the Mississippi Gambler, etc., and took "zillions" of pies in the face.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

====Los Angeles====
In 1960, Sales moved to the ABC-TV Studios in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]. ABC-TV cancelled the show in March 1961, but it continued as a local program on KABC-TV until January 1962. The show briefly went back on the ABC network as a late night fill-in for ''[[The Steve Allen Show]]'' in 1962 but was canceled after three months. All of the puppets on the show during its Los Angeles run were also operated by [[Clyde Adler]]. {{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}. A 1962 TV Guide listing refers to him as "West Coast disk jockey and comedian". His fame was significant enough to warrant utilizing him as a "Tonight" show guest host in the period between Jack Paar and Johnny Carson.

====New York====
[[File:Frank Sinatra and Soupy Sales.jpg|thumb|180px|As Sales' guest, Frank Sinatra was no more immune to a pie in the face than his host.]]
On September 7, 1964, Sales found a new weekday home at [[WNYW-TV|WNEW-TV]] in [[New York City]]. This version was seen locally until September 2, 1966.  260 episodes were syndicated by [[Screen Gems]] to local stations outside the New York market during the 1965–66 season. This show marked the height of Sales' popularity. It featured guest appearances by stars such as [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Tony Curtis]], [[Jerry Lewis]],&lt;ref name="NYTOBIT"/&gt; [[Judy Garland]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=October 23, 2009|last=Hinckley|first=David|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/2009/10/23/2009-10-23_friend_remembers_soupy_sales_as_someone_whod_.html|title= Friend remembers Soupy Sales as someone who'd 'do anything for you'|publisher= [[Daily News (New York)]]|accessdate=October 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sammy Davis Jr.]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=October 24, 2009|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/opinion/editorials/soupy_sales_ZUMi9n4Vt4xyjOOetSFGPN|title=Soupy Sales, 1926–2009|publisher=[[New York Post]]|accessdate=October 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as musical groups like [[the Shangri-Las]], [[The Supremes]] and [[The Temptations]].

As with his earlier shows, Sales performed musical numbers on the show and his extensive jazz record collection was used in his TV work. "Mumbles" by [[Oscar Peterson]] with [[Clark Terry]] was Pookie's theme. "[[Comin' Home Baby!]]" by [[Herbie Mann]] was the theme for Sales' "Gunninger the Mentalist" character (a parody of [[Dunninger|Dunninger the Mentalist]]). This was also the period when Sales starred in the movie comedy ''[[Birds Do It]]''. During the run of the New York show, actor [[Frank Nastasi]] played White Fang, Black Tooth, Pookie, and all the "guy at the door" characters. {{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

===The New Soupy Sales Show: Los Angeles===
''The New Soupy Sales Show'' appeared in 1978 with the same format, and ran for one season. 65 episodes were briefly syndicated, through Air Time International, to local stations in early 1979. It was taped in Los Angeles at [[KTLA]], with Clyde Adler returning to work as a puppeteer with Sales. {{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

===Characters on the show===
[[File:Soupy Sales and White Fang 1957.JPG|thumb|180px|Sales with White Fang in 1957]]
Clyde Adler, the show's floor manager and a film editor at Detroit's WXYZ-TV, performed in sketches and voiced and operated all puppets on Sales' show in Detroit in the 1950s and in Los Angeles from 1959 to 1962, as well as in 1978. Actor [[Frank Nastasi]], who played the part of Gramps on WXYZ-TV's other kids show "Wixie Wonderland", assumed the role of straight man and puppeteer when Sales took the show to New York from 1964 to 1966. Nastasi was originally from Detroit and had worked with Sales at WXYZ. Appearing on the show were both [[puppet]]s and live performers.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

The puppets were:
* '''White Fang''', "The Biggest and Meanest Dog in the USA", who appeared only as a giant white shaggy paw with black triangular felt "claws", jutting out from the corner of the screen. Fang spoke with unintelligible short grunts and growls, which Soupy repeated back in English, for comic effect. White Fang was often the pie thrower when Soupy's jokes bombed.
* '''Black Tooth''', "The Biggest and Sweetest Dog in the USA", also seen only as a giant black paw with white triangular felt claws, and with more feminine, but similarly unintelligible, dialogue. Black Tooth's trademark was pulling Soupy off-camera to give loud and noisy kisses.  
* For a short time there was a third dog character that became White Fang's girlfriend, Marilyn Monwolf. She caused some rivalry of affections between Black Tooth and White Fang, but later jilted them both for Joe Dogmaggio.
* '''Pookie the Lion''', a lion puppet appearing in a large window behind Soupy (1950s), was a hipster with a rapier wit. For example: Soupy: "Do you know why my life is so miserable?" Pookie: "You got me!" Soupy: "That's why!"  One of Pookie's favorite lines when greeting Soupy was, "Hey bubby... want a kiss?".  In the Detroit shows, Pookie never spoke but communicated in whistles.  That puppet also was used to mouth the words while pantomiming novelty records on the show.
* '''Hippy the Hippo''', a minor character who occasionally appeared with Pookie the Lion. [[Frank Nastasi]] gave Hippy a voice for the New York shows. Clyde Adler also voiced Hippy in the shows done in the late 1970s.

Regular live characters included:
* '''Peaches''', Soupy's girlfriend, visually played by footage of Sales in feminine costume.
* '''Philo Kvetch''', a [[private detective]] played by Sales in a long-running comedy skit during the show's New York run (a parody of early 20th century fictional detective [[Philo Vance]]).
* '''The Mask''', evil nemesis of Philo Kvetch, revealed in the last episode to be [[Nikita Khrushchev]], who had been deposed about a year earlier.
* '''"Onions" Oregano''', henchman of The Mask, played by Frank Nastasi, who ate ''loads of onions''. Every time Oregano would breathe in Philo's direction, Philo would make all sorts of comic choking faces, pull out a can of air freshener, and say "Get those onions out of here!"
* '''Hobart and Reba''', a husband and wife who lived in the [[potbelly stove]] on the New York set.
* '''Willie the Worm''' was a 35-cent toy Sales got from [[F. W. Woolworth Company|Woolworth's]], according to WXYZ art director Jack Flechsig. With animated squeezings of his rubber air bulb, the latex accordion worm flexed in and out of a little apple. Willy was "The Sickest Worm in all of Dee-troit" and suffered from a perennial cold and comically explosive sneeze. He helped read birthday greetings to Detroit-area kids while the show was on WXYZ. Willie did not survive the show's move to the Big Apple.
* '''Clark Bent''', actually Clark Kent or "Superman."  All the newspaper characters were there including '''Louis Lane''' - "that's Lois!".  He always had trouble finding a phone booth to change into "Superman."

===New Year's Day incident===
On January 1, 1965, miffed at having to work on the holiday, Sales ended his live broadcast by encouraging his young viewers to tiptoe into their still-sleeping parents' bedrooms and remove those "funny green pieces of paper with pictures of U.S. Presidents" from their pants and pocketbooks. "Put them in an envelope and mail them to me", Soupy instructed the children. "And I'll send you a postcard from [[Puerto Rico]]!" &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snopes.com/radiotv/tv/soupy1.asp New Year's Eve incident]&lt;/ref&gt; Several days later, a chagrined Soupy announced that money (mostly [[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]] money&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was unexpectedly being received in the mail. He explained that he had been joking and announced that the contributions would be donated to charity. As parents' complaints increased, WNEW's management felt compelled to suspend Sales for two weeks. Young viewers picketed Channel 5. The uproar surrounding Sales' suspension increased his popularity. Sales described the incident in his 2001 autobiography ''Soupy Sez! My Life and Zany Times''.&lt;ref name="soupy-sez"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sales|first=Soupy|author2=Charles Salzberg|title=Soupy Sez!

===Topless dancer prank===
The show's set included a door in the background. During the show, Sales would answer a knock at the door and interact with an actor seen only as an arm. Occasionally, the person at the door was a celebrity, such as [[Burt Lancaster]] or [[Fess Parker]]. Once, while the show was being broadcast live from Detroit, Sales' studio crew pulled a prank on him: when he opened the door, he saw a topless dancer partially covered with a balloon. Some reports say the gag was furthered by the crew switching the studio monitors so that Sales would think the stripper image was going out over the air. A second, nonbroadcasting, camera captured the uncensored version, while a stagehand moved a balloon back and forth in the doorway, giving at least some indication to the home viewers what was supposed to be behind the door. Sales was forced to try to keep the show going without revealing the risque scene backstage. The prank was recreated when the show originated in Los Angeles. The Los Angeles prank footage survives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.detroitkidshow.com/naked_soupy.htm Detroit Kid Show.com website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sales' novelty dance record, '"The Mouse" dates from the mid-1960s period of his career, when his show was based in New York. Sales performed "The Mouse" on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' in September 1965, just prior to [[The Beatles]]' segment on the show. Sales signed with [[Motown Records]] in 1969 releasing a single, "Muck-Arty Park" (a play on the 1968 hit "[[MacArthur Park (song)|MacArthur Park]]"), as well as an album ''A Bag of Soup''.

His program was between the [[drive time]] shifts of [[Don Imus]] (morning) and [[Howard Stern]] (afternoon), with whom Sales had an acrimonious relationship.

On December 21, 2007, Stern revealed this was a stunt staged for "theater of the mind" and to torture Sales; in truth, the piano was never harmed. Sales' on-air crew included his producer, Ray D'Ariano, newscaster Judy DeAngelis, and pianist Paul Dver.
