Baldwin chronicled his seven-year battle to remain a part of his daughter's life in his 2008 book, co-authored with Mark Tabb, ''A Promise to Ourselves: A Journey Through Fatherhood and Divorce''.&lt;ref name="Baldwin 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://mensnewsdaily.com/2009/01/02/alec-baldwin-a-promise-to-ourselves/ | title= Alec Baldwin: A Promise to Ourselves | first = Mike | last= LaSalle | publisher=MensNewsDaily.com | date = January 2, 2009 | archivedate= February 24, 2009 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090224013447/http://mensnewsdaily.com/2009/01/02/alec-baldwin-a-promise-to-ourselves/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baldwin contends that after their separation in December 2000, his former wife, [[Kim Basinger]], endeavored to deny him access to his daughter by refusing to discuss parenting,&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin 2008. p25.&lt;/ref&gt; blocking visitation,&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin 2008. pp 71, 117, 150–51, 153, 166, 169.&lt;/ref&gt; not providing telephone access,&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin 2008. pp. 43, 71, 127, 153–54, 178, 180.&lt;/ref&gt; not following court orders,&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin 2008. pp. 117, 155, 165, 175–77.&lt;/ref&gt; not dropping their daughter off for reasons of convenience,&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and directly lobbying the child.&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin 2008. p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; He contends that she spent over $1.5 million in the effort.&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin 2008. pp. 185, 202.&lt;/ref&gt; Baldwin called this [[parental alienation]] syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin 2008. pp. 75–94.&lt;/ref&gt;

Baldwin has called the attorneys in the case "opportunists", and has characterized Basinger's psychologists as part of the "divorce industry". He has faulted them more than Basinger, and writes, "In fact, I blame my ex-wife least of all for what has transpired. She is a person, like many of us, doing the best she can with what she has. She is a litigant, and therefore, one who walks into a courtroom and is never offered anything other than what is served there. Nothing off the menu, ever."&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin 2008. pp. 215–216.&lt;/ref&gt; Baldwin wrote that he spent over a million dollars,&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin 2008. pp. 202–03.&lt;/ref&gt; has had to put time aside from his career,&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin 2008. p. 99, 102.&lt;/ref&gt; has had to travel extensively,&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin 2008. pp. 41, 45, 151–53.&lt;/ref&gt; and needed to find a house in [[California]] (he lived in [[New York (state)|New York]]),&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin 2008. pp. 44, 47, 117.&lt;/ref&gt; so that he could stay in his daughter's life.&lt;ref name="Baldwin 2008"/&gt;

Baldwin contended that after seven years of these issues, he hit a breaking point, and on April 11, 2007, left an angry voicemail message in response to another unanswered arranged call, in which Baldwin called his 11-year-old daughter a "rude, thoughtless little pig".&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin 2008. pp. 173–184.&lt;/ref&gt; He contends that the tape was sold to [[TMZ.com|TMZ]] which released the recording, despite laws against publishing media related to a minor without the permission of both parents.&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin 2008. pp. 178–179.&lt;/ref&gt; Baldwin admitted that he made a mistake, but asked not to be judged as a parent based on a bad moment.&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin 2008. pp. 101, 151.&lt;/ref&gt; He later admitted to ''[[Playboy]]'' in June 2009 that he contemplated [[suicide]] over the voicemail that leaked to the public. Of the incident, he said, "I spoke to a lot of professionals, who helped me. If I committed suicide, [ex-wife Kim Basinger's side] would have considered that a victory. Destroying me was their avowed goal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Alec-Baldwin-Suicide-1006923.aspx |title=Alec Baldwin Says He Considered Suicide Over "Rude Pig" Voicemail |work=TV Guide |accessdate=June 16, 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uFXhnbN6?url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Alec-Baldwin-Suicide-1006923.aspx |archivedate=November 15, 2010 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1995 photographer incident===
In October 1995, Baldwin allegedly assaulted a photographer for videotaping his wife, [[Kim Basinger]], and their 3-day-old daughter. The couple was returning from the hospital and were confronted by the photographer outside their Los Angeles home. [[Whoopi Goldberg]] praised Baldwin for his actions during her opening monologue while hosting the [[68th Academy Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-10-27/local/me-61811_1_alec-baldwin|title=Alec Baldwin Arrested in Battery on Photographer|date=October 27, 1995 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=March 27, 2014|first=Nicholas|last=Riccardi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/special/l96os054.htm|title=Sassy Whoopi takes charge|date=March 26, 1996 |work=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=March 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Runway incident===
In December 2011, Baldwin was on an [[American Airlines]] flight at [[Los Angeles International Airport]], playing ''[[Words with Friends]]'' on his phone while waiting for takeoff. When instructed to put away the "electronic device" by the flight attendant, he reportedly became belligerent and was eventually removed from the plane. He later publicly apologized to the passengers who were delayed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/alec_baldwin_thrown_off_flight_at_ikgro0tlAWEveH4IMoa4YK "Alec Baldwin thrown off AA flight at LAX for 'playing game' on phone"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130827001837/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/alec_baldwin_thrown_off_flight_at_ikgro0tlAWEveH4IMoa4YK |date=August 27, 2013 }}. ''New York Post''.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2012 commercial for [[Capital One]] credit cards, for which Baldwin was a spokesperson, made a humorous reference to the event: a [[Viking]] character from the ad series asks about the phone Baldwin is using, to which Baldwin facetiously replies that it is not to be used on the runway, ending with a chiding "No!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ispot.tv/ad/7VAh/capital-one-battle-speech-featuring-alec-baldwin|title=Capital One TV Spot, 'Battle Speech' Featuring Alec Baldwin|publisher=''iSpot.tv''|accessdate=May 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[2012 Super Bowl]] commercial for [[Best Buy]] also humorously referenced the event. In the commercial, ''Words With Friends'' co-creators [[Paul Bettner]] and David Bettner are on a plane, and are interrupted by a flight attendant who loudly clears her throat to indicate to them to put their phones away.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/06/best-buy-super-bowl-commercial-tech-inventors_n_1255351.html "Best Buy Super Bowl Commercial: Ad Stars Tech Inventors (VIDEO)"].

Baldwin also spoofed the incident during a cameo appearance on ''Saturday Night Live''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s "[[Weekend Update]]" segment, in which he played himself impersonating the captain of the plane from which he was removed, who publicly "apologized" to Baldwin for the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dillon|first1=Nancy|last2=Mikelberg|first2=Amanda|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/alec-baldwin-surprise-appearance-saturday-night-live-spoof-american-airlines-tantrum-article-1.989943|title=Alec Baldwin makes surprise appearance on 'Saturday Night Live' to spoof American Airlines tantrum |publisher=''[[New York Daily News]]''|date=December 11, 2011|accessdate=May 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNH2tOuuZvA "Alec Baldwin Mocks American Airline Incident on 'Saturday Night Live'"]. [[ABC News]]/[[YouTube]]. December 12, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Victim of stalking===
On April 8, 2012, a 40-year-old [[French-Canadian]] actress, Genevieve Sabourin, was arrested outside Baldwin and his wife's [[Greenwich Village]] apartment house and charged with aggravated harassment and stalking. She was released without bail and told not to contact Baldwin. Prosecutors said she and Baldwin had met on a film set more than ten years earlier, and that, beginning in 2011, she began sending him multiple unwanted emails and texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/cops-canadian-actress-genevieve-sabourin-stalked-alec-baldwin-article-1.1058561  |title=Alec Baldwin stalked by Canadian actress Genevieve Sabourin in New York City, Hamptons: cops | first= Rocco |last= Parascandola | first2=Christina | last2=Boyle| first3=Tracy|last3=Connor |location=New York|newspaper=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]] | date= April 9, 2012 | accessdate= 2014-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Manhattan prosecutors filed nearly two dozen harassment and stalking charges against her, saying she had continued her unwanted advances. On April 8, she rejected a [[plea bargain]], and a trial date was set for May 13.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Accused Alec Baldwin stalker bugged prosecutor, too|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/accused-alec-baldwin-stalker-bugged-prosecutor-article-1.1310702|location=New York|newspaper=Daily News | first=Shayna | last= Jacobs | date= April 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 8, at the end of a non-jury trial, Manhattan Criminal Court Judge Robert Mandelbaum found Sabourin, by then 41, guilty on all counts and sentenced her to 180 days in jail for stalking, attempted aggravated harassment, and harassment, plus 30 days for attempted [[contempt of court]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20755778,00.html|agency=[[Associated Press]]|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]|title=Alec Baldwin Stalker Genevieve Sabourin Sentenced to Six Months in Jail|date=November 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/genevieve-sabourin-guilty-counts-stalking-alec-baldwin-article-1.1516724|title=Alec Baldwin stalker found guilty: Genevieve Sabourin thinks 7-month jail stint will 'help her career', friend says|first=Shayna|last=Jacobs|first2=Rich|last2=Schapiro|first3=Corky|last3=Siemaszko|location=New York|newspaper=Daily News|date=November 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sabourin was released from New York City's [[Rikers Island]] jail on March 28, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/alec-baldwin-stalker-jail-article-1.1738628|title=Alec Baldwin's stalker is out of jail after serving less than six months|first=Shayna|last=Jacobs|location=New York|newspaper=Daily News|date=March 28, 2014|accessdate=2014-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political views==
Baldwin is a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] and endorsed [[Barack Obama]] in his two presidential campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/alec-baldwin/bush-three-is-wrong----is_b_97881.html|work=Huffington Post|first=Alec|last=Baldwin|title=Bush Three Is Wrong – Is Clinton Three Any Better?|date=2008-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Weinger|first1=Mackenzie|title=Hollywood stars open wallets for Obama|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0711/59184.html|website=Politico|publisher=[[Politico|Politico LLC]]|accessdate=October 11, 2014|date=July 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He serves on the board of [[People for the American Way]]. He is an [[animal rights]] activist and a strong supporter of [[PETA]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=A Night Out With: Alec Baldwin; Mellow Is Not His Role|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0C13FD355C0C718EDDAF0894DB404482&amp;scp=14&amp;sq=alec%20baldwin%20+vegetarian&amp;st=cse|date=June 22, 2003|first=Hilary|last=De Vries|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=March 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=And the Oscar Goes to ...

During his appearance on the comedy late night show ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'' on December 11, 1998, eight days before President [[Bill Clinton]] was to be [[Clinton impeachment|impeached]], Baldwin said, "If we were in another country ... we would stone [[Henry Hyde]] to death and we would go to their homes and kill their wives and their children. We would kill their families, for what they're doing to this country."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Baker |first=Brent H. |url=http://www.mediaresearch.org/cyberalerts/1998/cyb19981215.asp#5 |title='Stone Henry Hyde to Death!' |work=CyberAlert |date=December 16, 1998 |publisher=Media Research Center |accessdate=March 3, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uFXmj9FM?url=http://www.mediaresearch.org/cyberalerts/1998/cyb19981215.asp#5 |archivedate=November 15, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Baldwin later apologized for the remarks, and the network explained that it was meant as a joke and promised not to re-run it.&lt;ref name="Constant Conflict: Politics, Culture, and the Struggle for America's Future"/&gt;

Baldwin said in a 2006 interview with ''[[The New York Times]]'' that if he did become involved in electoral politics, he would prefer to run for [[Governor of New York]]. When asked if he was qualified for the office, Baldwin responded that he considered himself more qualified than California Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]].&lt;ref name="Getting In on the Sitcom Act"/&gt; In June 2011, ''[[The Daily (News Corporation)|The Daily]]'' reported that Baldwin was mulling over a 2013 run for [[Mayor of New York City]] in the wake of a potential early race shake-up after candidate Congressman [[Anthony Weiner]]'s [[sexting]] scandal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedaily.com/page/2011/06/08/060811-news-alec-baldwin-1-2|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20120210212700/http://www.thedaily.com/page/2011/06/08/060811-news-alec-baldwin-1-2|dead-url=yes|archive-date=February 10, 2012|title=Political Smart Alec|date=June 8, 2011|accessdate=August 20, 2011|first=Richard|last=Johnson|work=[[The Daily (News Corporation)|The Daily]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on December 21, 2011, Baldwin said he was abandoning plans to run for the office and would instead continue in his role on ''30 Rock''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/alec-baldwin-rules-2013-mayoral-campaign-article-1.995075|title=Alec Baldwin rules out 2013 NYC mayoral campaign|date=December 21, 2011|accessdate=December 23, 2011|first=Richard|last=Johnson|work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2009, Baldwin spoke out to encourage state leaders to renew New York's tax break for the film and television industry, stating that if the "tax breaks are not reinstated into the budget, film production in this town is going to collapse and television production is going to collapse and it's all going to go to California".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ny1.com/archives/nyc/all-boroughs/2009/02/26/alec-baldwin-calls-on-governor-to-extend-tax-credit-NYC_94633.old.html|title=Alec Baldwin Calls on Governor To Extend Tax Credit|publisher=[[NY1]]|date=February 27, 2009|accessdate=November 17, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161117222539/http://www.ny1.com/archives/nyc/all-boroughs/2009/02/26/alec-baldwin-calls-on-governor-to-extend-tax-credit-NYC_94633.old.html|archivedate=November 17, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[63rd Primetime Emmy Awards]], Baldwin was slated to appear in a taped skit. However, the producers of the show cut a portion of the skit containing a reference to [[Rupert Murdoch]] and the [[News International phone hacking scandal]]. Baldwin subsequently boycotted the [[Emmy Award]]s and requested that his entire appearance be removed from the broadcast. Producers complied and he was replaced with [[Leonard Nimoy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Baldwin out of Emmys after hacking joke nixed|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/sep/19/alec-baldwin-emmys-phone-hacking|accessdate=November 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite demonstrating strong political beliefs throughout his career, in October 2013, Baldwin announced that he would not donate money to political candidates while hosting his talk show ''[[Up Late with Alec Baldwin]]'' on [[MSNBC]], in accordance with the company's policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Mirkinson | first = Jack | title = Alec Baldwin Will Not Donate To Political Candidates While At MSNBC | publisher = The Huffington Post | url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/25/alec-baldwin-donations-msnbc_n_4163346.html | date = October 25, 2013 | accessdate = November 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
