==Career==
While a stand-up comedian,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=View source for Rick Siegel|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Siegel?action=edit|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larry David also worked as a store clerk, limousine driver, and historian. He lived in [[Manhattan Plaza]], a federally subsidized housing complex in the [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]] neighborhood of [[Manhattan]], across the hall from [[Kenny Kramer]], the inspiration for the [[Cosmo Kramer]] character in ''Seinfeld''.&lt;ref&gt;McShane, Larry. [http://www.suntimes.com/entertainment/people/149555,CST-NWS-kramer26.article "The real Kramer says actor no racist: But Richards is 'paranoid,' 'very wound-up'"], ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]{{dead link|date=October 2012}}'', November 26, 2006. Accessed August 11, 2009. "The real Kramer lived for 10 years in a Hell's Kitchen apartment across the hall from ''Seinfeld'' co-creator Larry David, and his life became the framework for Richards' quirky, bumbling Seinfeld sidekick."&lt;/ref&gt; David then became a writer for and cast member of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Fridays (TV series)|Fridays]]'' from 1980 to 1982, and a writer for [[NBC]]'s ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (''SNL'') from 1984 to 1985.&lt;ref name="odds"&gt;{{cite news |accessdate=2008-04-25 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/07/16/style/the-great-and-wonderful-wizard-of-odds.html |title=The Great and Wonderful Wizard of Odds |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2000-07-16 |author=Marin, Rick }}&lt;/ref&gt; During his time at ''SNL'', he was able to get only one sketch on the show, which aired at 12:50 AM, the last time slot on the show.&lt;ref name="last laugh"&gt;{{cite news |accessdate=2008-04-25 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/11/AR2005111102037.html |title='SNL in the '80s': The Last Laugh On a Trying Decade |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=2005-11-12 |author=Shales, Tom }}&lt;/ref&gt;

David quit his writing job at ''SNL'' in the first season, only to show up to work a few days later acting as though nothing had happened. That event inspired a second-season episode of ''Seinfeld'' entitled "[[The Revenge (Seinfeld)|The Revenge]]".&lt;ref name="AudioCom"&gt;{{cite video|title=Seinfeld Seasons 1 &amp; 2: Audio Commentary - "The Revenge"|medium=DVD|publisher=[[Sony Pictures Home Entertainment]]|date=November 3, 2004|people=[[Julia Louis-Dreyfus|Louis-Dreyfus, Julia]]; [[Michael Richards|Richards, Michael]]; [[Jason Alexander|Alexander, Jason]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Side-splitting 'Seinfeld' finally arrives on DVD|page=C7|author=Horiuchi, Vince|date=November 22, 2004|work=[[Salt Lake Tribune]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  David met his future ''Seinfeld'' stars during that early stage of his career: he worked with [[Michael Richards]] (Kramer) on ''Fridays''&lt;ref name="odds" /&gt; and with [[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]] (Elaine)&lt;ref name="last laugh" /&gt;  on ''SNL''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |accessdate=2008-04-02 |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=CC&amp;s_site=contracostatimes&amp;p_multi=CC&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=1063FD1A84FAFC62&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM |title=Eager Actor Finds Kramer a Bit of a Trial |publisher=[[Contra Costa Times]] |date=1997-05-30 |author=Koltnow, Barry}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |accessdate=2008-04-02 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/03/garden/a-visit-with-julia-louis-dreyfus-she-who-gives-seinfeld-estrogen.html |title=Julia Louis-Dreyfus: She Who Gives 'Seinfeld' Estrogen |work=The New York Times |date=1993-06-03 |author=Kolbert, Elizabeth }}&lt;/ref&gt; He can be heard heckling [[Michael McKean]] when McKean hosted ''SNL'' in 1984, and he can be seen in the sketch "The Run, Throw, and Catch Like a Girl Olympics" when [[Howard Cosell]] hosted the season finale in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-04-21 |url=http://www.tv.com/saturday-night-live/show/365/episode_guide.html?season=10 |title=Saturday Night Live |publisher=[[TV.com]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227052119/http://www.tv.com/saturday-night-live/show/365/episode_guide.html?season=10 |archivedate=2008-12-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://snltranscripts.jt.org/84/84dmono.phtml Transcript of Michael McKean's monologue], voice of audience member: Larry David&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989 David teamed up with [[comedian]] [[Jerry Seinfeld]] to create a [[television pilot|pilot]] for NBC called ''[[The Seinfeld Chronicles]]'', which became the basis for ''[[Seinfeld]]'', one of the most successful shows in history,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |accessdate=2008-04-25 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/26/us/seinfeld-says-it-s-all-over-and-it-s-no-joke-for-nbc.html |title=Seinfeld Says It's All Over, And It's No Joke for NBC |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=1997-12-26 |author=Carter, Bill }}&lt;/ref&gt; reaching the top of ''[[TV Guide]]{{'s}}'' [[TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time|list of the 50 greatest TV shows of all time]]. ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' ranked it the third-best TV show of all time. David made occasional uncredited appearances on the show, playing such roles as Frank Costanza's cape-wearing lawyer and the voice of [[George Steinbrenner (Seinfeld character)|George Steinbrenner]]. He was also the primary inspiration for the show's character [[George Costanza]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=2008-04-25 |url=http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/TV/9810/26/seinfeld/index.html |title=The 'real' George Costanza sues Seinfeld for $100 million |publisher=CNN |date=1998-10-26 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080619064459/http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/TV/9810/26/seinfeld/index.html |archivedate=June 19, 2008 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; David left ''Seinfeld'' on friendly terms after the seventh season but returned to write the series finale in 1998, two years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=2008-04-25 |url=http://www.sacbee.com/747/story/471870.html |title=DVD Review: 'Seinfeld: Season 9' wraps up all the hilarious nothingness |work=[[The Sacramento Bee]] |date=2007-11-05 |author=Dancis, Bruce |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080116220709/http://www.sacbee.com/747/story/471870.html |archivedate = January 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also continued to provide the voice for the Steinbrenner character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=[[The Sacramento Bee]] |title=Still ... seventh-season DVD shines |date=2006-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

David wrote 62 of the episodes of ''[[Seinfeld]]'', including 1992's "[[The Contest]]", for which he won a [[Primetime Emmy Award]] and which ''[[TV Guide]]'' ranked the episode {{Abbr|No.|Number}} 1 on its list of "TV's [[Top 100 Episodes of All Time]]".&lt;ref name=TVGuide100Episodes&gt;"TV's Top 100 Episodes of All Time" ''[[TV Guide]]''; June 15, 2009; Pages 34–49&lt;/ref&gt; Syndication of ''Seinfeld'' earned David an estimated $250 million in 1998 alone.

===''Curb Your Enthusiasm''===
{{Main|Curb Your Enthusiasm}}
[[File:LarryDavidDec09.jpg|thumb|right|David in December 2009]]

The [[HBO]] [[cable television]] channel aired David's 1-hour special, ''[[Larry David: Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'', on October 17, 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/curb-your-enthusiasm/larry-david-curb-your-enthusiasm-69591/|title=Curb Your Enthusiasm: Larry David: Curb Your Enthusiasm|last=TV.com|website=TV.com|access-date=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'', a television series on HBO that aired its first episode on October 15, 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/curb-your-enthusiasm/tv-listings/100103/|title=Curb Your Enthusiasm|website=TVGuide.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show revisits many of the themes of ''[[Seinfeld]]'',&lt;ref name="influence"&gt;{{cite news |accessdate=2008-04-19 |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-26533172_ITM |title=COMEDY CLUB.(Jerry Seinfeld: a film 'Comedian,' and his influence on the 'Curb Your Enthusiasm' TV show) |publisher=[[The New Yorker]] |date=2002-10-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is improvised from a story outline only several pages long that David writes (as of the 5th season, additional writers were hired).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=2011-07-25 |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/curb-your-enthusiasm-and-seinfeld-writers-talk-about-the-legend-of-larry-david-20110720 |title='Curb Your Enthusiasm' and 'Seinfeld' Writers Talk About the Legend of Larry David |publisher=RollingStone |date=2011-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The actors improvise their dialogue based on the story outline, direction, and their own creativity. David has said that his character in the show, a fictionalized version of himself, is what he would be like in real life if he lacked social awareness and sensitivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/larry-david-talks-dating-post-divorce-seinfeld-and-wealth-20110720|title=Larry David Talks Dating Post-Divorce, 'Seinfeld' and Wealth|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=July 20, 2011|accessdate=July 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character's numerous and frequent social faux pas, misunderstandings, and ironic coincidences are the basis of much of the show's comedy and have led to the entry into the American pop culture lexicon of the expression "Larry David moment", meaning an inadvertently created socially awkward situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Yeah, I'm available for Woody Allen'|author=David Brinn|newspaper=Jerusalem Post |date=October 8, 2009 |url=http://www.jpost.com/Magazine/Yeah-Im-available-for-Woody-Allen }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The basis of the show is the events in David's life following the fortune he earned from the ''Seinfeld'' series; David, semi-retired, strives to live a fulfilled life.&lt;ref name="mexico" /&gt; Alongside David is his wife Cheryl (played by [[Cheryl Hines]]), his manager and best friend Jeff (played by [[Jeff Garlin]]), and Jeff's wife Susie (played by [[Susie Essman]]).

Celebrities, including comedians [[Bob Einstein]], [[Wanda Sykes]], and [[Richard Lewis (comedian)|Richard Lewis]], appear on the show regularly. Actors [[Ted Danson]] and [[Mary Steenburgen]] have had recurring roles as themselves.&lt;ref name="mexico"&gt;{{cite web|title=Once Upon A Time In Mexico Columbia Tristar Home Entertainment DVD |url=http://www.rickmcginnis.com/dvd/069.htm |work=Life with Blog: Father |publisher=rick mcginnis |accessdate=August 24, 2012 |author=rick mcginnis |year=2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080614140331/http://www.rickmcginnis.com/dvd/069.htm |archivedate=June 14, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show is critically acclaimed and has been nominated for 30 Primetime Emmy Awards, with one win, as well as one Golden Globe win. In the first six seasons, [[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]] and [[Jason Alexander]] appeared in several episodes, and [[Jerry Seinfeld]] made a cameo. In season 7, the cast of ''Seinfeld'', including [[Michael Richards]], returned in a story arc involving David's attempt to organize a ''Seinfeld'' reunion special.

On Wednesday, June 2, 2010, the series premiered on the [[TV Guide Network]], making its network television debut. [[TV Guide Network]] also produced a series of related discussions with high-profile guest stars, media pundits, and prominent social figures called "Curb: The Discussion" debating the moral implications depicted in each episode. David is quoted as saying "Finally, thanks to the TV Guide Network, I'll get a chance to watch actual, intelligent people discuss and debate the issues addressed on 'Curb'. Now if only someone could tell me where this alleged 'Network' is, I might even watch it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businesswire.com/portal/site/home/permalink/?ndmViewId=news_view&amp;newsId=20100322005537&amp;newsLang=en |title=TV Guide Network Teams-up with Legendary Show Creator Larry David to Launch "Curb Your Enthusiasm" Exclusive Extras Hosted by Series Regular Susie Essman |date=March 22, 2010 |accessdate=March 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other projects===
David has also been involved in other films and television series. David wrote and directed the 1998 film ''[[Sour Grapes (1998 film)|Sour Grapes]]'', about two cousins who feud over a [[casino]] jackpot. It was neither a commercial nor a critical success.&lt;ref name="sour grapes"&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=2008-04-02 |url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=sourgrapes.htm |title=Sour Grapes |publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=2008-04-02 |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/sour_grapes/ |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |title=Sour Grapes}}&lt;/ref&gt; He appeared in minor parts in two 1980s [[Woody Allen]] films&amp;nbsp;– ''[[Radio Days]]'' and ''[[New York Stories]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=2008-04-02 |url=http://hollywoodinsider.ew.com/2008/02/larry-david-to.html |title=Larry David, Evan Rachel Wood to star in Woody Allen's next movie |publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=2008-02-06 |author=Sperling, Nicole |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080215060041/http://hollywoodinsider.ew.com/2008/02/larry-david-to.html |archivedate=2008-02-15 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– before taking the leading role in Allen's New York-based comedy film ''[[Whatever Works]]'' (2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |url=http://hollywoodinsider.ew.com/2008/02/larry-david-to.html?xid=rss-cnn-todayslatest-20080206-Allen+casts+Larry+David%2C+Evan+Rachel+Wood |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080218035906/http://hollywoodinsider.ew.com/2008/02/larry-david-to.html?xid=rss-cnn-todayslatest-20080206-Allen+casts+Larry+David%2C+Evan+Rachel+Wood |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-02-18 |title=Larry David, Evan Rachel Wood to star in Woody Allen's next movie |work=Hollywood Insider |accessdate=2008-02-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; David had a cameo appearance on the [[HBO]] series ''[[Entourage (U.S. TV series)|Entourage]]'' as a client of [[Ari Gold (Entourage)|Ari Gold]], and because his daughters were ''[[Hannah Montana]]'' fans, David, along with his daughters, guest-starred, as themselves, in the episode "My Best Friend's Boyfriend," in which they were waiting for a table at a fancy restaurant.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

During the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 U.S Presidential Election]], David supported and actively campaigned for [[Barack Obama]]. In December 2010 David penned an [[op-ed]] piece for ''[[The New York Times]]'', a sardonic critique of the extension of Bush-era tax cuts headlined "Thanks for the Tax Cut!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/12/21/us-larrydavid-idUSTRE6BK6VA20101221 |title= Reuters: Larry David "Praises" Tax Cuts for Rich in NY Times | date=2010-12-21

David appeared as a panelist on the [[NBC]] series ''[[The Marriage Ref (U.S. TV series)|The Marriage Ref]]'' and also played Sister Mary-Mengele in the 2012 reboot of ''[[The Three Stooges (2012 film)|The Three Stooges]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2011/05/03/larry-david-three-stooges-hunger-games-casting |title=Larry David Torments 'The Three Stooges' And 'Hunger Games' Finds More Tributes In Today's Casting Call » MTV Movies Blog |publisher=Moviesblog.mtv.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; David co-wrote and starred in the 2013 [[HBO]] television film ''[[Clear History]]''.

David wrote and starred in the Broadway play ''[[Fish In The Dark]]''. Also appearing were [[Rita Wilson]], [[Jayne Houdyshell]] and [[Rosie Perez]]. The play centers on the death of a family patriarch. It opened March 5, 2015. Jason Alexander took over David's role in July. The play closed in August.&lt;ref name="fish in the dark"&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=2015-01-13 |url=http://www.fishinthedark.com/ |title= Fish In The Dark}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zinoman|first1=Jason|title=Enthusiasm, Entirely Uncurbed: Larry David's 'Fish in the Dark' Comes to Broadway|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/01/theater/larry-davids-fish-in-the-dark-comes-to-broadway.html |accessdate=January 28, 2015|work=The New York Times|date=January 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of February 1, 2015, its advance sale of $13.5 million had broken records for a Broadway show.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/01/theater/larry-davids-fish-in-the-dark-comes-to-broadway.html "Enthusiasm, Entirely Uncurbed ; Larry David's 'Fish in the Dark' Comes to Broadway"] ''The New York Times'', January 28, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 and 2016 David had multiple guest appearances portraying [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 U.S.]] [[Bernie Sanders presidential campaign, 2016|presidential candidate]] [[Bernie Sanders]] on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''; he also hosted the show on February 6, 2016, with musical guest [[The 1975]] and a cameo from Sanders himself. In the summer of 2017, it became known through genealogical research, that Larry David is quite likely to actually ''be'' related to Bernie Sanders in some manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.aol.com/article/entertainment/2017/07/29/larry-david-bernie-sanders-are-related/23054716/ |title=Larry David and Bernie Sanders are related -- find out their surprising connection |last=Seemayer |first=Zach |date=July 29, 2017 |website=aol.com |publisher=America Online |access-date=July 31, 2017 |quote=When Larry David played Bernie Sanders during a guest spot on Saturday Night Live back in October 2015, people were blown away by the Curb Your Enthusiasm star's spot-on impression of the former Democratic presidential candidate. As it turns out, there might be more to their similarities than David's comedic talents -- David and Sanders are actually genealogically related. The 70-year-old comedian recently participated in the PBS docuseries ''[[Finding Your Roots]]'' -- which researches celebrities' genealogical history and lineage to give them a deeper insight into their heritage -- and they revealed that he has family ties to the Vermont senator.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
David married [[Laurie David|Laurie Lennard]] on March 31, 1993.&lt;ref name="birthname"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aolcdn.com/tmz_documents/07_davids_divorce_wm_01.pdf|title=Laurie Ellen David v.

A DNA test, conducted as part of the [[PBS]] series ''[[Finding Your Roots]]'' in October 2017, has shown that Larry David and [[Vermont]] Senator [[Bernie Sanders]], whom David famously parodied on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' skits during [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2016|the presidential primaries of the Democratic Party in 2016]], are in fact distant cousins of shared [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry]].

As of 2013, David's estimated net worth was $900 million. However, the estimate according to a former [[Reuters]] reporter does not take into account the divorce. David also disputes the figure, saying he has nowhere near that amount.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=2014-08-29 |url=http://www.mediabistro.com/fishbowlny/larry-david-jerry-seinfeld-curb-enthusiasm-syndication_b92214 |title= Larry David, Jerry Seinfeld: Nothing But Net Worth |author=Horgan, Richard }}&lt;/ref&gt;
