'''Anna Russell''' (born '''Anna Claudia Russell-Brown'''; 27 December 1911{{spaced ndash}}18 October 2006) was an English–Canadian singer and comedian. She gave many concerts in which she sang and played comic musical sketches on the piano.  Among her best-known works are her concert performances and famous recordings of ''The Ring of the Nibelungs (An Analysis)'' – a humorous 22-minute synopsis of [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'' – and (on the same album) her [[parody]] ''How to Write Your Own [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] Opera.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite_web|last=Shepherd|first=Marc|title=Anna Russell's "How to Write Your Own Gilbert and Sullivan Opera" (1953)|url=http://gasdisc.oakapplepress.com/mdanna.htm|accessdate=6 March 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107103317/http://gasdisc.oakapplepress.com/mdanna.htm|archivedate=7 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and career ==

===Early life===
Russell was born in [[Maida Vale]], London, England,&lt;ref&gt;Her birth registration shows that she was registered as Ann C. Russell-Brown in the March Quarter of 1912 in the registration district of Paddington, Volume 1a, page 9. The Paddington registration district includes Maida Vale. Her mother's maiden name was Tandy.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Guardian]]'' (Patrick O'Connor) [http://arts.guardian.co.uk/news/obituary/0,,1929757,00.html Anna Russell: Accomplished musical comedian famous for her lampooning of Wagner's Ring cycle] 24 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Times]]'' [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,60-2421794.html Anna Russell: Versatile singer and comedienne who parodied works from Wagner to Cole Porter]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;''Daily Telegraph'' obituary [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&amp;grid=&amp;xml=/news/2006/10/21/db2101.xml Anna Russell] 21 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Globe and Mail'' (Sandra Martin) [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20061028.OBRUSSELL28/TPStory/Obituaries Anna Russell, SINGER AND PARODIST 1911–2006]&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|Some sources erroneously state her birthplace was [[London, Ontario|London]], Ontario.&lt;ref name="NY Times"&gt;''New York Times'' (Edward Rothstein) [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/20/obituaries/20russell.html Anna Russell, Deft Parodist of Operatic Culture, Dies at 94] 20 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Toronto Star"&gt;''Toronto Star'' (Olivia Ward) [https://www.thestar.com/NASApp/cs/ContentServer?pagename=thestar/Layout/Article_Type1&amp;call_pageid=971358637177&amp;c=Article&amp;cid=1161553809379 Anna Russell, 94: Opera parodist] 23 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/20/AR2006102001598_pf.html Washington Post obituary].

Michener Art Museum profile] and [http://www.marbecks.co.nz/detail/index.lsd?catalogID=272415 this New Zealand publisher profile].&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} and was educated at [[St Felix School]] at [[Southwold, Suffolk]], at Harrogate College and in [[Brussels]] and Paris.  She studied at the [[Royal College of Music]],&lt;ref name="NY Times" /&gt; where her piano teacher was [[Marmaduke Barton]] (whose wife's maiden name happened also to be Anna Russell).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allmusic.com/artist/anna-russell-mn0000585684 all music: Anna Russell]&lt;/ref&gt; She had a difficult childhood, and particularly a difficult relationship with her mother, who often shipped her off to live with other relatives for some time. Russell was twice married and divorced, first to John Denison and second to artist [[Charles Goldhamer]].  In her "Who's Who" entry she described herself as single.&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt;

In one of Russell's comic routines she said that some of the world's greatest teachers had completely ruined her voice, going on to relate that she was interrupted early in her graduation song recital by the Royal College's judges who indicated her singing was a joke.  Whether this was literally true or not, it is a fact that she began to think of what she might be able to do with the voice and technique she had.

Russell's early career included a few engagements in opera (including a disastrous appearance as a substitute Santuzza in a British touring production of ''[[Cavalleria rusticana]]'', where she clumsily tripped on a set piece and pulled it down – an event later used in her comedy) – as well as appearances as a [[Folk music|folk]] singer on [[BBC]] radio in 1931. Russell's mother was Canadian, and the family returned in 1939 to [[Toronto]], after her father's death, where she began to appear on local radio stations as an entertainer.&lt;ref&gt;''Bloomberg'' (Shirley Apthorp) [http://www.bloomberg.co.uk/apps/news?pid=20601088&amp;refer=home&amp;sid=aofoWteWTkhI "Anna Russell, Comic Who Made Fun of Richard Wagner, Dies at 94"].&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; [https://thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/anna-russell-emc/ "Anna Russell"]. ''The Canadian Encyclopedia''. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930014830/http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0009613 |date=30 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1940, she was beginning to find success as a soloist on the concert stage in Canada.  Russell's first one-woman show as a parodist was sponsored by the Toronto Imperial Order of the Daughters of the Empire in 1942, though it was the Canadian conductor Sir [[Ernest MacMillan]] who really set her on her international career as a "musical cartoonist", when he invited her to take part in his annual burlesque Christmas Box Symphony Concert in 1944. Russell made her New York City debut in her one-woman show in 1948, which she toured throughout North America, Britain, Australia and the rest of the English-speaking world.

===Peak years===
In her first major successful season, 1952–53, she performed in 37 cities in the United States and Canada before an estimated 100,000 listeners. Her recording ''Anna Russell Sings?'' became a best seller.&lt;ref name="NY Times"/&gt; She wrote the lyrics and music for ''Anna Russell's Little Show'' (1953) and sang the role of the Witch in an animated film of the opera ''[[Hansel and Gretel: An Opera Fantasy|Hansel and Gretel]]'' in 1954, also singing that role at [[New York City Opera]] the same year and with the Cosmopolitan Opera in San Francisco in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;Bloomfield, Arthur ''The [[San Francisco Opera]]'' (Comstock, 1978) notes Russell's affiliation with the Cosmopolitan Opera (a group that ceased operations in 1960) at page 182.&lt;/ref&gt;

She took  ''Anna Russell's Little Show'' to Broadway in 1953 and also appeared on Broadway in ''All by Myself'' in 1960. In 1963, with Robert Paine Grose and Joan White, she founded Grow Productions, Inc., which presented ''[[Lady Audley's Secret]]'' at the [[1964 New York World's Fair|New York World's Fair]] in 1964.  She also played a leading role in [[Noël Coward]]'s comedy ''[[Blithe Spirit (play)|Blithe Spirit]]''.  Other stage shows included ''[[Quality Street (play)|Quality Street]]'' in 1965 at the [[Bucks County Playhouse]] in [[Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nowtime.com/bucks-playhouse/1965.php 1965: Bucks County Playhouse] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130620004648/http://nowtime.com/bucks-playhouse/1965.php |date=20 June 2013 }}, Bucks County Playhouse official website (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Russell appeared on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' and in a number of plays and television episodes.  She performed her concerts at New York's [[Carnegie Hall]] and London's [[Royal Albert Hall]].  In 1977, she played the Duchess of Crackenthorp in the [[Canadian Opera Company]] production of ''[[La fille du régiment|Daughter of the Regiment]]'', a role which she later recreated for [[Tulsa Opera]] in a production with [[Erie Mills]] and [[Giorgio Tozzi]].

Russell became known for her deadpan humour, including her disbelieving emphasis of the absurd in well accepted stories and her mockery of pretension.  For example, in her humorous analysis of Wagner's Ring cycle, she began by noting that the first scene takes place in the River Rhine:  "''In'' it!!"  After pointing out that a character in the Ring Cycle is the first woman that Siegfried has ever met who is not his aunt, she pauses and declares, "I'm not making this up, you know!"  This phrase also became the title of her autobiography, published in 1985. At the end of her monologue she sings the Rhinemaidens' leitmotif and declares, "You're exactly where you started, 20 hours ago!"  Besides her Ring and [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] parodies, Russell was famous for other routines, including "Wind Instruments I Have Known", and parodies of Lieder ("Schlumpf"), French art songs ("Je ne veux pas faire l'amour" and "Je n'ai pas la plume de ma tante"), English folk songs ("I Wish I Were a Dicky-Bird" and "Oh How I Love the Spring"), and English music-hall songs ("I'm Only A Faded Rose"); even stretching to blues and jazz ("I Gave You My Heart and You Made Me Miserable").

Perhaps the apotheosis of Russell's Wagner Ring parody came during the celebrations of the Cycle's 100th Anniversary in 1976 when [[Wolfgang Wagner]] held a dinner and musical soiree featuring lighter entertainment based on his grandfather's music.  The program included some [[Souvenirs de Munich|Chabrier adaptations into waltzes and polkas]], and was capped by playing Russell's Ring send-up for his guests.

She composed, wrote, and performed her own material for [[Columbia Records]], was the author of ''The Power of Being a Positive Stinker ''(1955) and the ''Anna Russell Songbook'' (1958), and was the President of the B &amp; R Music Publishing Company.  She received the Canadian Women's Press Club Award in 1956 as the best Canadian comedy writer of the year.  Giving advice on how to be a successful singer, she quipped that although a glorious voice was important, "it helps to be an independently wealthy, politically motivated, back-stabbing bitch."

===Later years===
Russell retired to [[Unionville, Ontario]], Canada, in the late 1960s, living on a street named after her, but she went on several "farewell" tours in the 1970s and 1980s, including one-woman shows at [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts]] and [[Carnegie Hall]] parodying opera divas who did the same.&lt;ref name="Toronto Star" /&gt; In 1980 she played Helga ten Dorp opposite [[Charles Dennis]]'s Sidney Bruhl in ''[[Deathtrap (play)|Deathtrap]]'' at the Grand Theatre in London, Ontario.

In 1975 she toured rural New South Wales and interstate centres in the joint Ashton’s Circus and Degrey-Williams-Kendall production ‘The Clown Who Lost His Circus’. This unusual circus pantomime, which combined performing acts with a play, featured Sydney actors Colin Croft, Anna Russell, Keith Little, Anita Roberts, Peter Williams and Ron May.

In her last years she moved to Australia to be cared for by Deirdre Prussak, a fan who became Russell's close friend for over 50 years.  Russell and Prussak had developed a kind of mother-daughter relationship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sites.google.com/site/rosedaleassoc/hi/swanee-lodge-and-its-environs Swanee Lodge and its environs] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623191326/http://sites.google.com/site/rosedaleassoc/hi/swanee-lodge-and-its-environs |date=23 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Guardian, 24 October 2006"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/oct/24/guardianobituaries.obituaries1 The Guardian, 24 October 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;  Prussak was the author of ''Anna in a Thousand Cities'', a memoir of Anna Russell's life.
