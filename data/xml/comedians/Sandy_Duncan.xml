'''Sandra Kay "Sandy" Duncan''' (born February 20, 1946) is an American singer, dancer, comedienne and actress of [[Broadway theatre|stage]] and [[television]]. She is known for her performances in the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] revival of ''[[Peter Pan (1954 musical)|Peter Pan]]'' and in the [[sitcom]] ''[[The Hogan Family]]''. Duncan has been nominated for three [[Tony Award]]s, two [[Emmy Award]]s, and two [[Golden Globe Award]]s.

==Early life==
Duncan was born in [[Henderson, Texas]], to Sylvia (1922–1997) and Mancil Ray Duncan (1921–1994), on February 20, 1946. She and her sister Robyn were raised in [[Tyler, Texas]], near Henderson.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

==Career==
[[File:Flip Wilson Sandy Duncan Liz Torres Pinocchio 1976.jpg|thumb|180px|Duncan as ''[[Pinocchio (1976 TV musical)|Pinocchio]]'' with [[Flip Wilson]] as Fox and [[Liz Torres]] as Cat (TV musical, 1976)]]
She started her entertainment career at age 12, working in a local production of ''[[The King and I]]'' for $150 a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first=Patricia| last=Brennan| title=Sandy Duncan: 'The Hogans' and Her Own| url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/73615715.html?dids=73615715:73615715&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Jun+26%2C+1988&amp;author=Patricia+Brennan&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=y.07&amp;desc=Sandy+Duncan%3B+%60The+Hogans%27+And+Her+Own| work=[[The Washington Post]]| page=7| date=June 26, 1988| access-date=2017-08-28| subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1960s, Duncan was an unknown actress in [[Los Angeles]] when she was selected for a part in a commercial for United California Bank (later [[First Interstate Bancorp|First Interstate Bank]] and subsequently merged with [[Wells Fargo]]), portraying a bank teller who finds it impossible to pronounce the Greek name of customer "Nicholas H. Janopaparopoulos", despite several tries. She then apologetically asks, "Do you mind if I just call you 'Nick'?"&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=qxQtYJVQnJA|title=Sandy Duncan - United California Bank Commercial}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, she spent a brief time acting in the soap opera ''[[Search for Tomorrow]].''

In 1970, she was named one of the "most promising faces of tomorrow" by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine. Also that year, she starred in the Broadway revival of ''[[The Boy Friend (musical)|The Boy Friend]]'', for which she received favorable reviews. Duncan made her feature film debut co-starring opposite [[Dean Jones (actor)|Dean Jones]] in the [[Walt Disney]] family comedy ''[[The Million Dollar Duck]]''. She was then cast as "Amy Cooper" in the Paramount film version of ''[[Star Spangled Girl]]'', based on the Broadway play by [[Neil Simon]]. Both movies performed poorly at the box office. In autumn 1971, Duncan starred as "Sandy Stockton" in the [[CBS]] sitcom ''[[The Sandy Duncan Show#Funny Face|Funny Face]]''. The program was put on the Saturday night prime-time schedule between ''[[All in the Family]]'' and ''[[The New Dick Van Dyke Show]].'' Critics dismissed the show, but praised Duncan, especially the ''[[TV Guide]]'' columnist [[Cleveland Amory]], who described her as "a wonderful comedienne".{{Quote without source|date=March 2016}}

Meanwhile, shortly after the premiere, Duncan underwent surgery to remove a benign [[brain tumor]] behind her left optic nerve. As a result, she lost vision in the eye, but it was not replaced with a [[Ocular prosthesis|prosthetic eye]], as some urban myths claim. She lost vision in her left eye, but because the eye still tracked with her right eye, Duncan and her doctors elected to leave her natural eye in place. Though Duncan's recovery from the operation was rapid, CBS suspended production on the show until the following year, after the 12th installment had been filmed; the original series pilot served as the 13th (and final) episode. At first, [[Nielsen ratings]] for ''Funny Face'' were low, ranking in the lower 50s; eventually, they climbed up to #17, and it was deemed the best-liked new show of that television season. For all her efforts, Duncan received a nomination for an [[Emmy Award]] for "Outstanding Continued Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role in a Comedy Series". In September 1972, the program returned as ''[[The Sandy Duncan Show]]'', with a revised format and new writers; it also had a new time slot, on Sunday at 8:30 p.m. Critical reaction to the show was similar to that for ''Funny Face'', but without the strong Saturday night lead-in of ''All in the Family'', the ratings sank. After 13 episodes, CBS cancelled the series. In 1976, Duncan played the title role in a TV musical adaptation of ''[[Pinocchio]]'', which featured [[Danny Kaye]] as "[[Mister Geppetto]]" and [[Flip Wilson]] as "the Fox". She also guest-starred in a first-season episode of ''[[The Muppet Show]]'' where, contrary to common misconception, she was not the first to be karate-chopped by Miss Piggy, but she did share a raucous moment recollecting "The Banana Sketch" with Fozzie Bear. Next, for her performance as "Missy Anne Reynolds" in the miniseries ''[[Roots (1977 miniseries)|Roots]]'', she earned another Emmy nomination. It was then that she went back to Broadway for many years. In 1979, her run as the title role in ''Peter Pan'' won her many accolades. She also had replacement roles in ''[[My One and Only (musical)|My One and Only]]'' and ''[[Chicago (musical)|Chicago]].''

Duncan was nominated for a [[Tony Award]] three times: in 1969, as "Featured Actress (Musical)" in ''Canterbury Tales''; in 1971, as "Best Actress (Musical)" in ''The Boy Friend''; and in 1980, as "Best Actress (Musical)" in ''Peter Pan.''

In 1972, an animated version of Duncan (who contributed her own voice) appeared in "Sandy Duncan's Jekyll and Hyde", an episode of the CBS Saturday morning cartoon ''[[The New Scooby-Doo Movies]]''. In 1976, she guest-starred on ''[[The Six Million Dollar Man]]'' and ''[[The Bionic Woman]]'' playing the role of Gillian in "The Return of Bigfoot" episodes. In 1978, she starred in Disney's ''[[The Cat from Outer Space]]'' alongside [[Ken Berry]], [[Harry Morgan]] and [[Roddy McDowall]]. From the mid-1970s through the '80s, Duncan was the commercial spokesperson for the introduction of [[Nabisco]]'s [[Wheat Thins]] crackers.

In 1981, she voiced Vixey in ''[[The Fox and the Hound]]''. In 1984, she starred in a song and dance review called ''5-6-7-8...Dance!'' at [[Radio City Music Hall]] and provided voice work for the ''[[My Little Pony]]'' television special ''[[Rescue at Midnight Castle]]'' as Firefly and Applejack. From 1986 to 1987, she reprised her role as Firefly in the ''My Little Pony 'n Friends'' TV series. In 1987, she joined the cast of [[NBC]]'s ''Valerie's Family'' (previously known as ''Valerie'', later to be retitled ''[[The Hogan Family]]'') after [[Valerie Harper]] was dismissed from the sitcom. Duncan starred as the matriarch's sister-in-law, Sandy Hogan, who moved in with her brother Mike ([[Josh Taylor]]) and his three sons to help raise the family after Valerie Hogan's death. Duncan remained with the series through its cancellation in 1991 (the final season of which aired on CBS). In 1988, she worked on the first three ''[[Barney and the Backyard Gang]]'' children's videos. Duncan was asked to take part in the ''[[Barney &amp; Friends]]'' television series, but declined the offer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.courant.com/2002-03-22/features/0203221423_1_harper-s-character-hogan-family-sandy-duncan |title=In 'Second Glance,' It's Sandy Duncan |work=[[Hartford Courant]] |date=March 22, 2002 |last=Luna |first=Amy |access-date=2017-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, she voiced Peepers the mouse in the [[Don Bluth]] film ''[[Rock-a-Doodle]].'' In 1994, she voiced Queen Uberta in the [[Richard Rich]] film ''[[The Swan Princess]].''

In 2003, she appeared in the rotating cast of the [[Off-Broadway]] staged reading of ''[[Wit &amp; Wisdom]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theatermania.com/off-broadway/shows/wit-and-wisdom_20415/ |title=Wit &amp; Wisdom Tickets, News and Information &amp;#124; ArcLight Theatre |publisher=Theatermania.com |access-date=2012-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2008, she performed one of the lead roles in the musical ''[[No, No, Nanette]]''; a production of the City Center's annual ''[[Encores!]]'' series in [[New York City]]. In April 2009, she performed the lead role in the play ''[[Driving Miss Daisy (play)|Driving Miss Daisy]]'' at [[Casa Mañana]] Theatre in [[Fort Worth, Texas]]. In September 2009, she played the lead role in [[Tennessee Williams]]' play ''[[The Glass Menagerie]]'' at the Mountain Playhouse in [[Jennerstown, Pennsylvania]]. She has also been in many travelling stage productions, including '' [[The King and I]].''

On February 12, 2016, Duncan stepped into the role of Madame du Maurier in the Broadway production of ''[[Finding Neverland (musical)|Finding Neverland]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/article/Photo-Coverage-Pan-is-Back-Sandy-Duncan-Takes-Her-First-Bows-in-FINDING-NEVERLAND-20160213 |title=Photo Coverage: Pan is Back! Sandy Duncan Takes Her First Bows in Finding Neverland |publisher=Broadwayworld.com |date=February 13, 2016 |first=Jessica Fallon |last=Gordon |access-date=2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 17, the show's producers announced that she would take a temporary leave of absence due to family obligations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/article/Official-Sandy-Duncan-Takes-Temporary-Leave-from-FINDING-NEVERLAND-for-Family-Obligations-20160217 |title=Official: Sandy Duncan Takes Temporary Leave from FINDING NEVERLAND for 'Family Obligations' |publisher=Broadwayworld.com |date=February 17, 2016 |access-date=2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
She met singer-actor Bruce Scott (born Bruce Scott Zaharaides) during the Off-Broadway production of ''[[Your Own Thing]]'', and they were married in September 1968. Their divorce, finalized in October, 1972,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Sandy Duncan Gets Divorce| url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2245&amp;dat=19721019&amp;id=HrczAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=YTIHAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7307,3900067&amp;hl=en| work=[[Lodi News-Sentinel]]| date=October 19, 1972| page=7| agency=[[United Press International]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; was caused by Duncan's success and rise to stardom. Duncan told [[People (magazine)|''People'' magazine]] in 1979 that "It was very threatening to Bruce."&lt;ref name=people&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Langdon |first=Dolly |date=September 3, 1979 |title=After a Brain Tumor and Two Failed Marriages, Sandy Duncan Is Flying High Again |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20074485,00.html |work=[[People (magazine)|People]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her second marriage was to Dr. Thomas Calcaterra on January 10, 1973; it lasted until 1979. Duncan met Calcaterra when he was a consulting surgeon on her brain tumor surgery, after which they began dating.&lt;ref name=people /&gt; This marriage also failed, according to Duncan, because of the demands of her nightclub act that she toured with in 1978 and her refusal to stay at home and try to be a good "doctor's wife".&lt;ref name=people /&gt;

Since July 21, 1980, she has been married to [[Don Correia]], six years her junior. They have two sons, Jeffrey (born October 5, 1982) and Michael (born March 19, 1984). She and her husband live in [[New York City]]. Her father, Mancil Ray Duncan, died on December 22, 1994, and her mother died on December 23, 1997. [[Taylorville, Illinois]] (near [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]]) named a street in her honor, "Sandy Duncan Drive"; her character on ''Funny Face'' and ''The Sandy Duncan Show'', Sandy Stockton, is from Taylorville.
