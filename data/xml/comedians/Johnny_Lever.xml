He decided to leave school and started working odd jobs, such as selling pens on the streets of Mumbai by imitating [[Bollywood]] stars and dancing to the songs of Bollywood stars. He also spent his early years in [[Yakutpura]], an old city of [[Hyderabad]] where he learnt the unique style of comedy acting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bollynewsuk.com/2012/05/14/interview-i-have-learnt-a-lot-from-the-uk-johnny-lever/ Interview: "I have learnt a lot from the UK" – Johnny Lever | Bollywood News UK&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

During a [[Hindustan Unilever|Hindustan Lever Limited]] company function, he mimicked a few senior officers, and from that day on, the workers said he was not John Rao but was Johnny Lever. When he later joined the film industry, he decided to keep the name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=This johnny's levered to fame|url=http://www.financialexpress.com/old/fe/daily/20000321/fle19055.html|website=www.financialexpress.com|publisher=Indian Express Newspaper (Bombay) Ltd|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even before joining Hindustan Lever, he was giving stage performances. Because of his growing absenteeisms and since he was earning well from stage shows, he quit HLL in the year 1981. He did a lot of shows and world tours with them, one of his first big tours being with [[Amitabh Bachchan]] in 1982. At one of his shows, actor [[Sunil Dutt]] noticed his talent and potential and offered him his first movie ''[[Dard Ka Rishta]]''.

During this period, he also did a few commercials for Kachua chhap [[incense]], directed by [[Shekhar Kapur]].

Lever is a practicing [[Christian]]. When asked about his transition, Lever replied:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
It was God’s will. I had always been a religious person, but one incident changed my life. My son was diagnosed with [[cancer]]. I was helpless and turned to God for help. I stopped working in films and spent all my time praying for him. Ten days later, when he was taken for a test, the doctors were surprised because the cancer had vanished. It was the beginning of a new life for me.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Johnny Lever turns preacher | url = http://www.hindustantimes.com/entertainment/tabloid/johnny-lever-turns-preacher/article1-1045697.aspx | first = Ali | last = John | work = [[Hindustan Times]]| date = April 17, 2012 | accessdate = June 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
