'''Laura Madalene Solon''' (born April 1979) is an [[English people|English]] screenwriter, comedian, actress, and winner of the 2005 [[Perrier Comedy Award]].  She was the second woman to win as a solo performer, after [[Jenny Eclair]] in 1995.

==Background==
She was raised in [[Great Kimble]] near [[Aylesbury]]. She attended [[Downe House School]] followed by [[Worcester College, Oxford]] where she received a scholarship&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/gazette/1999-00/weekly/281099/coll.htm |title=Oxford University Gazette |publisher=Ox.ac.uk |date=28 October 1999 |accessdate=2010-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; to read English and started writing and performing in the [[Oxford Revue]].

==Career==
Solon tried her hand at being a [[stand up comedy|stand up comedian]] but found character comedy suited her better.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lee |first=Veronica |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2005/08/31/btedsolon31.xml&amp;sSheet=/living/2005/08/31/ixlivingtop.html |title='Perrier winner? I shouldn't have been on the list' |publisher=Telegraph |date=31 August 2005 |accessdate=2010-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 she won the [[Edinburgh Comedy Awards|Perrier Award]] for her one-woman [[Edinburgh Fringe]] show ''Kopfraper's Syndrome: One Man and His Incredible Mind''. Following this the [[BBC]] and [[Channel 4]] were keen to acquire her to produce material for them, and in April 2006 it was announced by the BBC that Solon had been signed to develop projects for them on Radio and TV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2006/04_april/05/solon.shtml |title=Press Office - Laura Solon signs to |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2010-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first series of ''[[Laura Solon: Talking and Not Talking]]'', a sketch and character comedy series, ran on [[BBC Radio 4]] in January and February 2007. The second series ran in May and June 2008, and the third in November 2009.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

Alongside [[Tony Hawks]] and [[Angus Deayton]] she appeared in the feature film ''[[Playing the Moldovans at Tennis]]'', which was recorded in 2010 and released in 2012.

In the first half of 2010 she toured with ''Rabbit Faced Story Soup'', a play set in a publisher's office in which she played every character. It contained characters from her radio show, ''Talking and Not Talking'', including Carol Price, a divorcee children's author, and Gwynneth the inept call centre worker. New characters included Marcia, an American super publishing agent.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

In 2011 Solon was one of the players in the BBC Two improvisational show ''[[Fast and Loose (TV series)|Fast and Loose]]'', hosted by [[Hugh Dennis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/fast_and_loose/ |title=British Comedy Guide entry for Fast and Loose |publisher=British Comedy Guide |accessdate=2011-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Kopfraper's Syndrome: One Man and His Incredible Mind''==
The title is in fact a holdover from an entirely different show that Solon had planned to perform with a male partner{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}. When the partner dropped out she rewrote the show in the three weeks leading up to the festival but retained the title in order not to negate the value of the advance publicity or confuse those who had already purchased tickets.

Solon plays eight different characters in the show, which consists of sketches of varying lengths, including:
*An [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] fan
*Caroline, an [[Australia]]n disabled housewife who is possessed by the ghost of [[Diana, Princess of Wales]]
*Karen, a prize-winning beautician
*Borgesia, a [[Poles|Polish]] story-teller
*A wedding planner from [[Rotherham]]
*A hunter who does not believe in [[zebra]]s
*Katrina, a corporate high-flier with an irrational terror of the [[Chinese people|Chinese]]
*A marketing assistant forced to dress as a bookworm

As a Perrier award-winning show it secured a run in [[West End theatre|London's West End]], at the Soho Theatre, in November 2005. Solon also received [[pound sterling|£]]7,500 with the prize.
