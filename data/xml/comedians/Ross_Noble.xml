'''Ross Markham Noble'''&lt;ref&gt;Fizzy Logic Tour, Launceston, Tasmania – 2007-07-04&lt;/ref&gt; (born 5 June 1976) is an English stand-up comedian and actor. Noble rose to mainstream popularity through making appearances on British television, particularly interviews and on panel shows such as ''[[Have I Got News for You]]''.&lt;ref name="wiltshire"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wiltshire/entertainment/theatre/rossnoble.shtml |title=Noble is wafflely versatile |author=Wilf Guyatt |publisher=BBC |accessdate=1 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also released DVDs of several of his tours.

In 2007 he was voted the 10th greatest stand-up comic on Channel 4's 100 Greatest Stand-Ups&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/C/comedy_standups/results/results.html |title=Explore |publisher=Channel 4 |date= |accessdate=15 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and again in the updated 2010 list as the 11th greatest stand-up comic. 

In 2012, Noble made his movie debut in the fantasy comedy horror movie ''[[Stitches (2012 film)|Stitches]]''. In 2015 he made his musical theatre debut in ''[[The Producers (musical)|The Producers]]'' and in 2018 was nominated for a [[Laurence Olivier Award]] for his performance in ''[[Young Frankenstein (musical)|Young Frankenstein]]'' in the [[West End theatre|West End]].

==Early life==
Noble was born in Newcastle upon Tyne&lt;ref&gt;birth Reg'd Newcastle upon Tyne Apr/May/June 1976 vol2 p0757&lt;/ref&gt; and brought up in Cramlington, Northumberland. Both of his parents were teachers.

==Stand-up performance==

Noble's stand-up routine is a largely improvised and surreal performance with a [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]] delivery. He is often referred to as a randomist. Often, a large percentage of his set becomes based around [[heckle]]s and conversations with members of the audience.&lt;ref name="wiltshire" /&gt;&lt;ref name="biog"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he does often have a few set topics which he performs throughout a tour, he describes the planning for the entire show as "about four words on a piece of scrap paper".&lt;ref name="interview20061106"&gt;[http://rossnoble.co.uk/downloads/2006.11.06%20Live%20on%20BBC%20Radio%201,%20UK.mp3 Ross Noble interview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070810152234/http://rossnoble.co.uk/downloads/2006.11.06%20Live%20on%20BBC%20Radio%201%2C%20UK.mp3 |date=10 August 2007 }}, [[Jo Whiley]] on [[BBC Radio 1]] on 2006-11-06&lt;/ref&gt;

Noble often [[mime]]s actions on-stage to help the audience visualise his surreal ideas, for example, telling the audience to never put a blanket over an owl, and exactly what an owl neck detection device is ("just a stick with a pointy bit on it") or showing the audience how to serve double header ice creams properly after considering his own made-up plot of ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'' in which [[Jack Bauer]] escapes a cell using a greasy [[goose]].&lt;ref name="unrealtime garrick"&gt;{{cite video | people = Noble, Ross | title = Unrealtime | medium = DVD | publisher = Stunt Baby | location = Garrick Theatre, London | date =  11 October 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Noble's style is recognized as spontaneous, due to his unpredictable performance style, interruptions from hecklers or because he has drifted off into another surreal tangent. During his shows he is known to dabble onto one topic, ask a member of the audience something about him or herself and use that as material, and carry on with that, and later on seems to forget about the routine, digressing into another topic. Thus the audience pesters Noble to tell the ending of his unfinished stories, which are usually eventually concluded at the end of his shows. His most famous example is in his ''Randomist'' tour, where he started to tell a story about him being interviewed after [[Live 8]] near the beginning of a show in [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]], which he did not finish until the end of the performance, around two hours later.&lt;ref name="randomist newcastle"&gt;{{cite video | people = Noble, Ross | title = Randomist | medium = DVD | publisher = Stunt Baby | location = The City Hall, Newcastle upon Tyne | date =  6 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This relates to an earlier comment he made in his ''Regent's Park'' show, saying that his mind "Tends to wander off [the point] slightly", and later added that "[he] can open up too many tangents at once... it's a never-ending expanding spiral of possibilities."&lt;ref name="unrealtime regents"&gt;{{cite video | people = Noble, Ross | title = Unrealtime | medium = DVD | publisher = Stunt Baby | location = Open-Air Theatre, Regent's Park, London | date =  11 October 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Early years===
Noble is originally from [[Cramlington]], [[Northumberland]], England. "The ultimate place to live" helped him with his career – he found little to do in his hometown so he became particularly imaginative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/threecounties/theatre/2003/11/ross_noble_interview.shtml | title = The Noble art of stand-up | accessdate = 27 September 2006 | publisher = BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 11, it was discovered that he was [[dyslexic]]. Because of this, Noble decided to work within a career which did not rely on academic skills. He had a brief stint as a street juggler with a friend, and aspired to join a circus. He joined a clown troupe and sold balloons as a stilt-walker, before deciding to become a comedian after winning tickets to a comedy show.&lt;ref name="age dyslexia"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/Arts/A-noble-comic/2005/03/18/1110913752482.html|title=Here's one I didn't prepare earlier|publisher=[[The Age]]|author=Luke Benedictus|date=20 March 2005|accessdate=3 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a teenager, Ross was a member of the youth theatre at the [[The People's Theatre, Newcastle upon Tyne|People's Theatre]] in Heaton. In 1997, he was doing warm-ups at the BBC for ''[[Friday Night Armistice]]''.

Noble has been performing stand-up since the dyslexia diagnosis, and appeared in his local comedy club at the age of 15, despite licensing laws that prohibited him working there and forced him to leave through the kitchen.&lt;ref name="biog"/&gt; Noble studied [[performing arts]] at [[Newcastle College]], after he told his careers adviser at school he wanted to be a [[comedian]]. He later stated that this had no effect on his stand-up ability, as he believes that the information taught is not important in being a good performer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/southyorkshire/stage/2003/01/ross_noble2.shtml | title = BBC – South Yorkshire Stage – Ross Noble interview | accessdate = 1 December 2006 | publisher = BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stand-up career===
Since starting as a stand-up comedian, Noble has won many awards, including a ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' award winner in 2000 for his [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] show ''Chickenmaster'', and a [[Perrier Comedy Award|Perrier Award]] nomination in 1999 for another Edinburgh show ''Laser Boy''. He has since achieved great popularity in both the UK and Australia, where he has toured extensively every year since 2001. Noble's 2003 show ''Unrealtime'' was the best-selling show at the Edinburgh Fringe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/3179241.stm | title = Fringe passes million tickets mark | accessdate = 6 November 2006 |date= 25 August 2003 | publisher = BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; before transferring to London's [[West End theatre|West End]] for a monthlong season at the [[Garrick Theatre]] where it played to packed houses. A recording of this tour was shown on [[BBC Two]] in 2004, and a double DVD set was released later that year.

During 2004, Noble performed at the [[Edinburgh Fringe]] and the [[Melbourne International Comedy Festival]] and other venues with his show ''Noodlemeister''. His 2005 UK tour, ''Randomist'', ran from September to December, of which he continued in Australia during 2006. In April 2006, Noble was involved in a [[motorbike]] accident, and both fractured and dislocated his collarbone. Conveniently he crashed right outside a hospital. Noble performed his shows over the following weeks with his arm in a sling.&lt;ref name="randomist australia"&gt;{{cite video | people = Noble, Ross | title = Randomist, Australia Tour | medium = DVD | publisher = Stunt Baby | location = Australia | date =  6 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his 'Things' tour, in [[Bristol]] on 1 March 2009, he claimed that before the ambulance officers would help him, he was forced to do his [[Stephen Hawking]] impression.

Whilst performing in Edinburgh in September 2006 for his ''Fizzy Logic'' tour, a fight broke out during the gig, caused by a drunken member of the audience arguing with another. Also, in his Edinburgh gig, some one gave him a basket of mini-muffins with faces printed on them; this is related to a sketch from Noble's DVD 'Sonic Waffle', in which he mentions his hobby of finding faces in muffins.&lt;ref name="nemone"&gt;Ross Noble interview, [[Nemone]] on [[BBC 6 Music]] (2006-09-27)&lt;/ref&gt; At another gig, he found someone filming the show on their mobile phone and confiscated the phone. He then recorded a video on it himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uKzeCaMpAY |title=Ross Noble |publisher=YouTube |date=4 September 2006 |accessdate=15 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After finding that several people recorded his finale skit, "The falling owl stunt", Noble encouraged the entire audience to record the stunt simultaneously and post them on [[YouTube]], in an attempt to achieve, "The largest number of videos showing exactly the same thing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlqJy6XMSjI |title=Ross Noble World Record Attempt |publisher=YouTube |date=20 May 2010 |accessdate=15 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then took his tour to Australia in February 2007, during which he filmed a documentary about his travels around the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=StuntBaby |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVcs0eLwcyY |title=Ross Noble IN |publisher=YouTube |date=1 April 2007 |accessdate=15 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 Noble finished his ''Nobleism'' tour in the UK&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rossnoble.co.uk/livedates.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070112055641/http://www.rossnoble.co.uk/livedates.html |archivedate=2007-01-12|deadurl=yes|title=Live Dates}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a show in [[Liverpool]] on 21 October 2007 which was screened live to 43 [[Vue (cinema)|Vue cinemas]]. If the event had sold out, he would have played to over 10,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2007/08/09/5634/nobles_big-screen_gig|title=Noble's big-screen gig |publisher=Chortle.co.uk|date=9 August 2007|accessdate=10 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon walking offstage, Noble enquired if the broadcast had succeeded and was informed by a technician that "it worked perfectly... but we lost Aberdeen". To this day, Noble maintains that this is the "coolest thing anyone has ever said" to him.&lt;ref&gt;Ross Noble, post-show conversation, ''Nonsensory Overload'', Aberdeen, 16 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Noble likes to have spontaneous material related to each specific show, and therefore encourages [[Heckler|heckling]] and has increasingly indulged in the audience giving him gifts during shows. At a gig at the [[Edinburgh Playhouse]] during Noble's 2005 Randomist tour, a member of the audience put his feet up on the stage, and later removed his shoes and put them on the stage instead. It is now traditional for the entire front row of an Edinburgh audience to place their shoes upon the stage during the interval, which causes Noble much amusement when he returns.&lt;ref&gt;Fizzy Logic Tour, Edinburgh 2006-09-09, Nobleism Tour, Edinburgh 2007-09-08&lt;/ref&gt;

Noble performed at the 2008 [[Latitude Festival]] and rounded off his set by leading everyone in the tent in a huge [[conga line]] (which quickly turned into a stampede) to a [[vegan]] food stand so they could all ask for pies and sausage rolls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tim Clark |url=http://www.suchsmallportions.com/festivals/latitude/2008/latitude-2008-ross-noble.html |title=Ross Noble runs riot at Latitude with 3,000 strong conga to vegan stall |publisher=Such Small Portions |date=15 July 2008 |accessdate=15 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/blog/index.php?blog=120&amp;p=4097&amp;more=1&amp;c=1&amp;tb=1&amp;pb=1 |title=The latest music blogs, free MP3s, best new bands, music videos, movie trailers and news analysis |publisher=Nme.com |date= |accessdate=15 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DVD of his show ''Nobleism'' was released in November 2009, after a legal battle with his previous manager prevented a release in 2008 as originally planned.

===TV and radio===

====Guest appearances====
Noble had not done any acting work on TV until the summer of 2013 when he appeared opposite [[Ian Smith (actor)|Ian Smith]] as a gay lover in the Australian TV series "It's a date",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Natalie Bochenski |url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/noble-and-neighbourly-comedic-pursuits-20130329-2gz1x.html |title=Noble and Neighbourly comedic pursuits |publisher=Smh.com.au |date=30 March 2013 |accessdate=15 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; or radio, as he prefers stand-up for giving him the freedom to say what he wants without being influenced by a script or crew.&lt;ref name="interview20061106"/&gt; Nevertheless, he has made many TV appearances, which mainly take the form of interviews and [[panel game]] participation. In the UK, he has appeared on [[BBC]]'s ''[[Johnny Vaughan|Johnny Vaughan Tonight]]'' and ''[[Friday Night with Jonathan Ross]]''.&lt;ref name="cv"&gt;[http://www.comedycv.co.uk/rossnoble/index.htm comedy cv - the UK's largest collection of comedians biogs and photos&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Noble has also made 16 appearances, the highest number of appearances of any guest, on BBC One's ''[[Have I Got News for You]]''&lt;ref name="noblesite"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rossnoble.co.uk|accessdate=17 October 2007|title=Ross Noble Homepage}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the first show guest presented by [[Paul Merton]]. His most memorable appearance on the show saw him and [[Paul Merton]] answer all their questions wrong, and getting no points in the entire show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | title = Episode 268 | series = Have I Got News for You | serieslink = List of Have I Got News For You episodes | airdate = 3 November 2006 | season = 32 | number = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was Paul Merton's guest on ''[[Room 101 (TV series)|Room 101]]'', where he wanted to consign to history the likes of [[Craig David]], cartoon animals who wear clothes, people who look like cats, [[clipboard]]s and [[Christian rock| Christian rock music]]. He makes regular contributions to [[BBC Radio 4]]'s ''[[Just a Minute]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/comedy/justaminute.shtml |title=BBC Radio 4 – Just a Minute |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=30 September 2013 |accessdate=15 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has also appeared on ''[[I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1405677732 |title=I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue 10 BBC Radio Collection: Amazon.co.uk: Humphrey Lyttelton, Tim Brooke-Taylor, Barry Cryer, Graeme Garden, Jeremy Hardy, Ross Noble, Andy Hamilton, Rob Brydon: Books |publisher=Amazon.co.uk |date= |accessdate=15 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and presented ''[[4 At The Store]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=4 At The Store |url=http://www.bbcshop.com/invt/0563523077&amp;bklist=icat,3,,listenforless |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206141109/http://www.bbcshop.com/invt/0563523077%26bklist%3Dicat%2C3%2C%2Clistenforless |archivedate= 6 February 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2007, Ross featured, as part of his "In The Company Of...", on the [[Colin Murray]] show on [[BBC Radio 1]], and in August 2007 Noble appeared on ''Steve Wright in the Afternoon'' on [[BBC Radio 2]].&lt;ref name="noblesite"/&gt;

In Australia, he has guested on such TV and radio shows as [[Network Ten]]'s ''[[Rove Live|Rove (Live)]]'',&lt;ref name="cv"/&gt; ''[[The Panel (Australian TV series)|The Panel]]'',&lt;ref name="cv"/&gt; ''[[Good News Week]]'', ''[[Thank God You're Here]]'', ''[[The Project (Australian TV program)|The Project]]'' and ''[[Hughesy, We Have a Problem]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tgyh.com.au/guests.htm|website=Thank God You're Here|title=Meet the Guests |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713183028/http://tgyh.com.au/guests.htm |archivedate=2007-07-13 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]]'s ''[[The Glass House (2001 TV series)|The Glasshouse]]'',&lt;ref name="cv"/&gt; ''[[Spicks and Specks (TV series)|Spicks and Specks]]'', and ''[[A Quiet Word With&amp;nbsp;...]]'',&lt;ref name=aqww-rn&gt;{{cite web|title=A Quiet Word With Ross Noble|url=http://www.abc.net.au/tv/guide/abc1/201105/programs/AC1063V003D2011-05-21T213347.htm|work=Official website|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=1 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Triple M]] radio show ''[[Get This]]'', regular appearances on [[Triple J]].

In Ireland, he appeared on the first series of ''[[Tubridy Tonight]]'', where he went over to a prop bookcase to inspect if the books were real. Upon reading one book, he found a photo of [[Mike Yarwood]] on one page, which he cut out and wore as a mask for a portion of the interview.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | title = Episode 3 | series = Tubridy Tonight | airdate = 30 October 2004 | season = 1 | number = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2010 he has made fourteen guest appearances on British comedy panel show ''[[QI]]''.

In July 2011 Ross appeared in the second episode of the [[List of Top Gear episodes#Series Seventeen|17th series]] of ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]''. On the show he revealed that he currently owns earth moving machines as well as an [[FV433 Abbot SPG|Abbott 433]] [[Self-propelled artillery|self propelled gun]], which he calls his "Tank". He did a lap around the Top Gear track in 1.43.5, beating [[Tom Cruise]] and placing him in second place behind [[John Bishop (comedian)|John Bishop]].

In 2012 he was a regular panelist on ''[[That Sunday Night Show]]'' on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]].

In April 2012 he featured on Triple J for a day where he co-hosted some shows, and played an imaginative game of [[Cluedo]], where they found people from around Melbourne that matched the Cluedo characters names to come into the studio and play.

Appears briefly in ''[[TT3D: Closer to the Edge]]'' in conversation with Richard 'Milky' Quayle.

====Hosted series====
Besides making various guest appearances, Noble has been the host of an Australian radio show, and the subject of two BBC radio series. Noble's worldwide travels as a stand-up were the subject of his own BBC Radio 4 series ''[[Ross Noble Goes Global]]'', produced by [[Danny Wallace (writer)|Danny Wallace]]. This series, recorded between April and May 2001, saw him recording his observations as he travelled around various countries. In January 2005, Noble joined Australian [[comedian]] [[Terri Psiakis]] in co-hosting ''[[Ross and Terri]]'', the weekday lunch shift on national radio station [[Triple J]]. Following on from ''Ross Noble Goes Global'', Radio 4 broadcast a new series called ''Ross Noble On...'' during January to February 2007. The 4-episode series followed his 2006 UK tour, featuring performances in [[Brighton]], [[York]], [[Manchester]] and [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/comedy/rossnoble.shtml |title=BBC Radio 4 – Ross Noble |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=15 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of the Radio 4 programmes have since been released as BBC audio CDs.

Noble once again teamed up with Terri Psiakis on Triple J for two weeks of ''Ross and Terri'' in January 2006. This second period on Triple J also saw Ross and Terri founding "Pants Across Australia", during which, 4 pairs of trousers were sent to the north, south, east and west extremities of Australia and then back to Melbourne.&lt;ref name="R&amp;T"&gt;{{cite web | title = Ross and Terri Homepage | publisher = Triple J | url = http://www.triplej.net.au/rossandterri/ | accessdate = 23 July 2007 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070829204713/http://triplej.net.au/rossandterri/ | archivedate = 29 August 2007 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ross and Terri'' did not return to this slot in 2007, however Terri Psiakis and Amy Blackmur (the pair's producer from their 2006 show) did present a limited run of shows during a similar time frame earlier in the year, under the working title "T 'n' A" ("Terri and Amy"). As well as this, Terri and Amy decided to continue in the evening slot of 6pm – 10pm.&lt;ref name="R&amp;T"/&gt;

In 2007, Stunt Baby Productions filmed a documentary about Ross Noble's 95-day Fizzy Logic tour of Australia. Ross Noble travels by motorbike when touring, which for this tour travelled on a [[BMW R1150GS|BMW R1150GS Adventure]] (as mentioned during the encore of one of his [[Canberra]] gigs), covering a distance of approximately 26,000&amp;nbsp;km around Australia clockwise from [[Brisbane]]. The show was broadcast as "Ross Noble's Australian Trip" on UK TV channel [[Five (TV channel)|Five]] from Monday 28 September 2009 at 10pm for 6 weeks, repeating at the same time on [[Fiver (channel)|Fiver]] on the following Thursdays. The show aired in Australia on Channel 10 on Mondays at 10:00 pm.

Noble hosts his own show on Dave titled ''[[Freewheeling (TV series)|Freewheeling]]''. Described as an anti-travelogue around Britain, in the show Noble takes the freestyle philosophy he embraces in his live shows and utilizes his trademark audience participation gimmick and transfers it to television as he rides around the UK on his motorbike taking live requests on Twitter instructing him on where he should go next, making the road trip entirely unpredictable. It airs on 29 October.

===Theatre===
Noble made his musical theatre debut as [[Franz Liebkind]] in the 2015 UK tour of [[Mel Brooks|Mel Brooks']] ''[[The Producers (musical)|The Producers]]'' from May to July 2015.

In September 2017 he played [[Igor (Young Frankenstein)|Igor]] in another Mel Brooks musical ''[[Young Frankenstein (musical)|Young Frankenstein]]'' at the [[Garrick Theatre]] in [[West End theatre|London's West End]] (following a tryout at the [[Theatre Royal, Newcastle]]) before leaving in February 2018 due to his Australian stand-up tour. Noble received a [[WhatsOnStage Awards|WhatsOnStage Award]] for his performance and was nominated for the [[Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role in a Musical]]. During his time in the show, he and co-star [[Hadley Fraser]] did a recording called "Poddin' On The Ritz" to discuss behind-the-scenes at the show and [[musical theatre]].

==Personal life==
Noble has two daughters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tyneandwear.sky.com/news/article/54921/ross-noble-on-being-a-dad-for-the-second-time|title=Ross Noble On Being A Dad For The Second Time|publisher=Sky Tyne and Wear|date=30 January 2013|accessdate=14 September 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130630080431/http://tyneandwear.sky.com/news/article/54921/ross-noble-on-being-a-dad-for-the-second-time|archivedate=30 June 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elfie and Willow, with his Australian wife, Fran. He lived on a farm in [[St Andrews, Victoria|St Andrews]], a semi-rural town on the northern outskirts of [[Melbourne]], Australia, until it was destroyed by [[7 February 2009 Victorian bushfires|2009 Victorian bushfires]] along with all his material possessions. Noble and his family were not harmed in the fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2009/02/10/8265/noble_loses_home_in_bush_fires|title=Noble loses home in bush fires|publisher=Chortle.co.uk|date=10 February 2009|accessdate=23 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/2009/02/11/comedian-ross-noble-loses-house-in-bush-fires-72703-22905886/|title=Comedian Ross Noble loses house in bush fires|work=[[Evening Chronicle]]|date=11 February 2009|accessdate=23 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family returned to the UK in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=[[Friday Night with Jonathan Ross]] |episodelink= |series= Friday Night with Jonathan Ross|serieslink=Friday Night with Jonathan Ross |credits= |network= |station= |airdate=21 May 2010 |season= |seriesno=18 |number=7 |minutes= |quote=Ross: So you've moved back to the UK? Noble: Yes, just moved back. |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A keen biker and off-road rider, Noble is also a fan of MotoGP, WSBK and The Isle of Man TT. He has created an off-road track in the paddock at his home and has a number of vehicles to use on it, including an [[FV433 Abbot SPG]] self-propelled gun. He has competed in many races, notably, The Romaniacs and the 24-hour Dusk to Dawn. He attended several track days in 2011, including Brands Hatch on the GP circuit as a guest of MSV aboard his Triumph Daytona 675R.

===Charity work===
Following [[7 February 2009 Victorian bushfires|2009 Victorian bushfires]], Noble has used the event in his act and donates profits from the sale of the show's programme/poster (or "postergram" as it is called) to a charitable fund to help those similarly affected.

Noble supports British charity [[Riders for Health]] and donated money earned from limited edition signed posters together with bucket collections after each gig from his Nonsensory Overload tour to Riders for Health. This raised £42,000 for Riders. He has attended their fundraising event Day of Champions on a number of occasions, most recently at Silverstone in 2010. He also voiced the Riders for Health BBC Radio 4 appeal aired just before Christmas 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.riders.org/n_details.aspx?nwId=361|title=Ross Noble donates £42,000 to Riders for Health|date=17 December 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110102210658/http://www.riders.org/n_details.aspx?nwId=361|archivedate=2 January 2011|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011, to celebrate his 20th anniversary of stand up, Noble teamed up with Triumph Motorcycles which were also celebrating a milestone, having just produced their 500,000th bike (since the company was relaunched 20 years earlier) and did the "Sit Down" tour. Using only Twitter as a guide, Noble travelled around the UK on the unique Triumph Speed Triple guided by his Twitter followers and accompanied by a film crew. The Triumph Speed Triple was auctioned by [[Bonhams]] at the Goodwood festival of speed on 1 July 2011, with all the proceeds (£8,000) going to Noble's charity of choice, Riders for Health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.riders.org/n_details.aspx?nwId=338|title=Triumph's milestone motorcycle raises £8,000|date=7 July 2011|archivedate=6 August 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110806123039/http://www.riders.org/n_details.aspx?nwId=338|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011, Noble competed in the [[Red Bull Romaniacs]], which is "one of the toughest extreme motorcycle events on the planet".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redbullromaniacs.com/start-rally|title=Red Bull Romaniacs 2011 Edition: Start Rally|archivedate=19 August 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110819212424/http://www.redbullromaniacs.com/start-rally|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of the Desert Rose Racing Team with fellow rider Clive "Zippy" Town (Dakar 2006) with both riders on 350 Exc-F KTM's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RIDER PROFILE – ROSS NOBLE (HOBBY TEAM CLASS) |url=http://www.redbullromaniacs.com/2011-edition/riders-profile/?rid=2636=340 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327213033/http://www.redbullromaniacs.com/2011-edition/riders-profile/?rid=2636%3D340 |archivedate=27 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
