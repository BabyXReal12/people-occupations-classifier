'''Amir Shmuel Blumenfeld''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|m|ɪər|_|ʃ|m|u|ˈ|ɛ|l|_|ˈ|b|l|uː|m|ə|n|f|ɛ|l|d}}; {{lang-he|אמיר שמואל בלומנפלד}}; born Jan. 18, 1983) is an [[Israeli-American]] comedian, actor, writer, [[Television presenter|television host]], and member of the American [[comedy duo]], [[Jake and Amir]]. Born in Israel, he moved to Los Angeles when he was two, and was hired by the New York City-based [[CollegeHumor]] in 2005. As well as contributing to its books and articles, he has written and starred in original videos for the comedy website—appearing in series such as ''Hardly Working'' and ''[[Very Mary-Kate]]''—and was a cast member on its short-lived [[MTV]] program ''[[The CollegeHumor Show]]''.

Amir first came to national prominence in 2004 when he was a semi-finalist during Yahoo's inaugural national IM Live contest, losing to the eventual champions. Now, he is best known for appearing in the [[web series]] ''[[Jake and Amir#Jake and Amir (web series)|Jake and Amir]]'' with [[Jake Hurwitz]], in which he plays an annoying and exaggerated version of himself. Originally made by Hurwitz and Blumenfeld in their spare time, the series was then produced by CollegeHumor. Blumenfeld's acting in the series gained him a [[Webby Award]] for Best Individual Performance in 2010.&lt;ref name="Webby"&gt;{{cite web|title=2010 – Best Individual Performance – People's Voice – Amir Blumenfeld|url=http://winners.webbyawards.com/2010/online-film-video/performance-craft-categories/best-individual-performance/amir-blumenfeld|work=[[Webby Award]]s|publisher=[[International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences]]|accessdate=September 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ''Prank War'' series, which depicts Blumenfeld and [[Streeter Seidell]] as they play a series of escalating [[practical joke]]s on each other, became popular and led to the two appearing on ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'' in 2009. MTV later hired Seidell and Blumenfeld to host ''[[Pranked (TV series)|Pranked]]'', a [[clip show]] featuring prank videos from the Internet. Long after these events, the original series was revealed to have been staged. &lt;ref&gt;https://headgum.com/if-i-were-you/episode-283-prank-wars-withstreeter-seidell&lt;/ref&gt; Outside of CollegeHumor, Blumenfeld has appeared in the short film ''[[The Old Man and the Seymour]]'', the television series ''[[Louie (U.S. TV series)|Louie]]'' and ''[[I Just Want My Pants Back]]'', and the 2011 film ''[[A Very Harold &amp; Kumar 3D Christmas]]''. He also writes for ''[[ESPN The Magazine]]'' and ''[[Mental Floss]]''.

==Personal life==
Blumenfeld was born in [[Afula]], [[Israel]],&lt;ref name="MJL"&gt;{{cite web|last=Moses|first=Jeremy|title=Jake &amp; Amir: Funnier Than You|url=http://www.myjewishlearning.com/blog/blog/general/jake-amir-funnier-than-you/|work=MyJewishLearning|date=April 21, 2009 |accessdate=September 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and moved to Los Angeles at the age of two&lt;ref name="COAHP"&gt;{{cite web|last=Luu|first=Valerie|title=Making CollegeHumor|url=http://www.cityonahillpress.com/2009/04/02/making-collegehumor/|work=City on a Hill Press|date=April 2, 2009|accessdate=September 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; with his parents and two older brothers—his family is [[Reform Judaism|Reform Jewish]].&lt;ref name="MJL" /&gt; He has described how he became aware of his humor early on: "I realized I was funny at an early age, I realized I could make people laugh at a later age, and then by [[Higher education in the United States|college]] time, I was trying to make jokes in terms of writing".&lt;ref name="Lorenzini"&gt;{{cite AV media | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEjaTwYFq04 | title=Amir Blumenfeld Interview | publisher=[[YouTube]] | date=December 12, 2008 | accessdate=September 14, 2013 | people=Lorenzini, Wesley (director)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He attended a Jewish [[kindergarten]] and [[elementary school]],&lt;ref name="MJL" /&gt; before going to [[Milken Community High School]], a [[Private school|private]] Jewish [[high school]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tabibzadeh |first=Sara |title=Who is the Milken student: What websites are we on? |url=http://milkenroar.com/blog/2011/03/02/who-is-the-milken-student-what-websites-are-we-on/ |work=The Roar |publisher=[[Milken Community High School|Milken Student Press]] |date=March 2, 2011 |accessdate=September 14, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105173851/http://milkenroar.com/blog/2011/03/02/who-is-the-milken-student-what-websites-are-we-on |archivedate=November 5, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the summer, he attended [[Tech camp|computer camp]] and [[Canada/USA Mathcamp|mathematics camp]], but has expressed regret that he did not go to a Jewish [[summer camp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rg9qLcjdU9s | title=Amir Blumenfeld: The Truth About Jewish Summer Camps | publisher=[[YouTube]] | people=Hutt, Jason (director) | medium=June 10, 2010 | work=MyJewishLearning}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blumenfeld graduated from  the [[Haas School of Business]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] with a Bachelor of Science degree, hoping to get a creative job in [[advertising]] or [[marketing]] while writing comedy on the side. He now uses his undergraduate degree "to make somewhat intelligent jokes about finance and accounting, but nothing much beyond that."&lt;ref name="COAHP" /&gt;

Blumenfeld is [[Judaism|Jewish]],&lt;ref name="Haaretz" /&gt; although he has described himself as "not too religious" and does not attend [[Synagogue|Temple]] every Saturday, nor does he [[Kashrut|keep Kosher]]. He does, however, celebrate Jewish holidays with his family&lt;ref name="MJL" /&gt; and speaks [[Hebrew]].&lt;ref name="Haaretz" /&gt; He is a [[basketball]] fan, and supports the [[Los Angeles Lakers]]—his favorite players are [[Kobe Bryant]] and [[Nick Van Exel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|url=http://blogs.thescore.com/tbj/2011/12/12/tbj-tour-video-two-minutes-with-amir-blumenfeld/|title=TBJ Tour Video: Two minutes with Amir Blumenfeld|date=December 12, 2011|publisher=[[theScore Inc.]]|accessdate=September 15, 2013|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130915101418/http://blogs.thescore.com/tbj/2011/12/12/tbj-tour-video-two-minutes-with-amir-blumenfeld/|archive-date=September 15, 2013|dead-url=yes|work=The Basketball Jones}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===CollegeHumor===
In 2003, while a [[Sophomore year|sophomore]] at Berkeley, Blumenfeld began writing articles for the comedy website [[CollegeHumor]] after he emailed its co-founder [[Ricky Van Veen]] ideas, which Van Veen found funny and posted on the website. When Blumenfeld graduated in 2005, CollegeHumor hired him and [[Streeter Seidell]] full-time to write ''The CollegeHumor Guide to College''&lt;ref name="MJL" /&gt;—a humorous book presented as a guide to [[university]] education—and he moved to New York City aged 22.&lt;ref name="Lorenzini" /&gt; He later moved to writing original videos for CollegeHumor with [[Dan Gurewitch]],&lt;ref name="Lorenzini" /&gt; and has acted in CH Originals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amir Blumenfeld|url=http://www.collegehumor.com/user/65455|work=[[CollegeHumor]]|accessdate=September 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the series ''Hardly Working''. He has portrayed [[Woody Allen]] in episodes of ''Hardly Working''&lt;ref name="GuyCodeBlog"&gt;{{cite web|last=Smiley|first=Brett|title=The 8 Best Woody Allen Impressions We Found On The Internet|url=http://guycodeblog.mtv.com/2010/12/01/the-best-woody-allen-impressions-on-the-internet/|work=[[MTV]]|accessdate=September 15, 2013|date=December 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Very Mary-Kate]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dreier|first=Troy|title=Elaine Carroll Is Very Funny and Very Mary-Kate|url=http://www.streamingmedia.com/Articles/ReadArticle.aspx?ArticleID=76954&amp;PageNum=2|work=Streaming Media|publisher=[[Information Today, Inc.|Information Today]]|accessdate=September 15, 2013|date=August–September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;—[[MTV]]'s ''[[Guy Code]] Blog'' listed his among "The 8 Best Woody Allen Impressions We Found On The Internet".&lt;ref name="GuyCodeBlog" /&gt; His favorite sketch written for CollegeHumor is entitled "Moments Before Cup Chicks", and involves a director briefing the participants of the viral scatological video ''[[2 Girls 1 Cup]]''.&lt;ref name="Lorenzini" /&gt;

Beginning in 2007, he and Streeter Seidell have appeared in the ''Prank War'' series of videos, in which the two play a series of escalating [[practical joke]]s on each other. Seidell has described how some of the pranks "showed Amir's true colors, his desire to be famous ... [and] cut deeper emotionally", and how he thought Blumenfeld's faking a [[marriage proposal]] from Seidell to his girlfriend went "too far". After seven videos were posted over two years, there was an 18-month hiatus culminating in Seidell tricking Blumenfeld into thinking he had won [[United States dollar|USD$]]500,000 after taking a blindfolded half-court basketball shot.&lt;ref name="Wired"&gt;{{cite web|last=Tanz|first=Jason|title=Practical Joking Becomes a Battle for the Last Laugh|url=https://www.wired.com/culture/culturereviews/magazine/17-09/mf_hoax_collegehumor|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|date=August 24, 2009|accessdate=September 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pranks have led to Seidell and Blumenfeld being interviewed by ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' magazine&lt;ref name="Wired" /&gt; and appearing on ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hurwitz|first=Jake|title=Prank War on Kimmel!|url=http://www.collegehumor.com/article/3943621/prank-war-on-kimmel|work=[[CollegeHumor]]|date=March 18, 2009|accessdate=September 14, 2013|authorlink=Jake Hurwitz}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pranks were revealed to be fake in July 2017 on the "If I Were You" podcast.

In 2009, Blumenfeld starred in ''[[The CollegeHumor Show]]'' on [[MTV]] along with eight other CollegeHumor employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The CollegeHumor Show – Cast Bios|url=http://www.mtv.com/shows/college_humor/season_1/cast.jhtml|work=[[MTV]]|accessdate=September 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The staff members wrote, filmed and starred in the show, which is set in the CollegeHumor offices and has a scripted [[Reality television|reality]] premise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stelter|first=Brian|title=Dudes!

Since 2010, Seidell and Blumenfeld have hosted ''[[Pranked (TV series)|Pranked]]'', an [[MTV]] series featuring pranks recorded on video and posted online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pranked|url=http://www.mtv.com/shows/pranked/series.jhtml|work=[[MTV]]|accessdate=September 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show has generally received poor reviews, with critics looking down on its [[clip show]] format and use of content from [[YouTube]], and calling it inferior to the "prank war" that inspired it.&lt;ref name="MichiganDaily"&gt;{{cite web|last=Chiu|first=Eric|title=MTV's 'Pranked' is a joke with no laughs|url=http://www.michigandaily.com/content/mtvs-pranked-joke-no-laughs|work=[[The Michigan Daily]]|date=September 7, 2009|accessdate=September 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gilbert|first=Matthew|title='Pranked' is another MTV lowlight|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/tv/articles/2009/08/27/reality_show_pranked_is_another_mtv_lowlight/|work=[[The Boston Globe|Boston.com]]|date=August 27, 2009|accessdate=September 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Michigan Daily]]''{{'s}} Eric Chiu said "Hosts Blumenfeld and Seidell do what they can with their material, but their banter and commentary is mostly forgettable", and "the ''Prank War'' series on CollegeHumor.com is a perfect example of discomforting gags done right&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;It's a shame that ''Pranked'' can't muster up anything near the same level of ingenuity."&lt;ref name="MichiganDaily" /&gt;

===''Jake and Amir''===
{{Main article|Jake and Amir}}
[[File:Jake Hurwitz 2007.jpg|thumb|Blumenfeld's comedy partner [[Jake Hurwitz]] in 2007|278x278px]]
Blumenfeld met his colleague [[Jake Hurwitz]] in 2006,&lt;ref name="Variety"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kushigemachi|first=Todd|title=Hurwitz &amp; Blumenfeld: College Humor duo graduate to next level|url=https://variety.com/2012/scene/people-news/hurwitz-blumenfeld-college-humor-duo-graduate-to-next-level-1118056720/|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=July 24, 2012|accessdate=September 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the latter began an [[internship]] at CollegeHumor. The two were seated across from each other, and began to make short videos together, which they uploaded to the video-sharing website [[Vimeo]].&lt;ref name="Haaretz"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kenan|first=Ido|title=Meet Jake and Amir, the most successful Jewish comedians on the Internet|url=http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/magazine/meet-jake-and-amir-the-most-successful-jewish-comedians-on-the-internet-1.433684|work=[[Haaretz]]|date=May 31, 2012|accessdate=September 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their first video was called "Quick Characters": it was unscripted, and involved either Hurwitz or Blumenfeld spontaneously pointing a camera at the other and instructing them to act in a certain way.&lt;ref name="Lorenzini" /&gt;

The two later began the [[web series]] ''Jake and Amir'', episodes of which they posted to jakeandamir.com.&lt;ref name="Haaretz" /&gt; In it, Hurwitz plays Jake, a "normal guy", and Blumenfeld plays Amir, his annoying and obsessive co-worker, who craves Jake's attention.&lt;ref name="Variety" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Haaretz" /&gt; Their videos began to be promoted on CollegeHumor, and the website later adopted the series.&lt;ref name="Haaretz" /&gt;

Blumenfeld has described how his character "sort of evolved" from being "super needy [and] weird" to "a little crazier", but that "the root of my character is still the same, the insecurity of it". Regarding his similarity to his character, he said he is "hopefully very different but maybe at the root of it we're the same person. I'm probably a little smarter than the character though. Maybe the things that he thinks I also think but I'm able to suppress them."&lt;ref name="Splitsider"&gt;{{cite web|last=Davis|first=Deirdre Ann|title=Talking to Jake and Amir About Their Web Series, CollegeHumor, and More|url=http://splitsider.com/2013/02/talking-to-jake-and-amir-about-their-web-series-collegehumor-and-more/|work=Splitsider|publisher=[[The Awl]]|date=February 20, 2013|accessdate=September 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 14th [[Webby Award]]s in 2010, ''Jake and Amir'' won a People's Voice award for Comedy: Long Form or Series,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2010 – Comedy: Long Form or Series – People's Voice – Jake and Amir|url=http://winners.webbyawards.com/2010/online-film-video/general-film-categories/comedy-long-form-or-series/jake-and-amir|work=[[Webby Award]]s|publisher=[[International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences]]|accessdate=September 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Blumenfeld won one for Best Individual Performance.&lt;ref name="Webby" /&gt; Blumenfeld received a nomination for the 2013 [[Streamy Awards]] for Best Male Performance: Comedy because of his role in ''Jake and Amir''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gutelle|first=Sam|title=The Nominees for the 3rd Annual Streamy Awards Are…|url=http://www.tubefilter.com/2012/12/17/3rd-annual-streamy-awards-nominees/|work=[[Tubefilter]]|accessdate=September 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After leaving CollegeHumor, Jake and Amir tried to land a TV show with [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] and later [[TruTV]], but eventually struck a deal with [[Vimeo]] to write and direct their own original web series, ''Lonely and Horny.'' Jake and Amir later founded the podcast network, HeadGum.

====''If I Were You''====
{{Main article|If I Were You (podcast)}}
On May 13, 2013, Hurwitz and Blumenfeld announced their first new project since ''Jake and Amir'': a comedy audio [[podcast]] called ''If I Were You'', in which they [[Advice column|give advice to listeners who submit questions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Podcast!|url=http://jakeandamir.com/post/50374908528/new-podcast|work=[[Jake and Amir#Jake and Amir (web series)|Jake and Amir]]|date=May 13, 2013|accessdate=September 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kayla Culver of ''The Concordian'' lauded the podcast as "comfortable to listen to" and "genuinely funny" and said "It's like listening to two best friends having a hilarious conversation on the couch next to you."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Culver|first=Kayla|title='If I Were You'|url=http://theconcordian.org/2013/09/30/if-i-were-you|work=The Concordian|publisher=[[Concordia College (Moorhead, Minnesota)|Concordia College]]|accessdate=October 2, 2013|date=September 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Guardian''{{'s}} [[Miranda Sawyer]] called ''If I Were You'' "a typical example of a comedy podcast" and "amiable enough", but said it contained "far too much laughing", commenting that "New Yorkers Jake and Amir laugh and laugh, giggle and chortle their way around a topic" and "if I wanted [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream-of-consciousness]] waffle with the occasional funny line, I'd listen to [my small children]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sawyer|first=Miranda|title=Rewind radio: If I Were You; TED Radio Hour; Stuff You Should Know; Stuff Mom Never Told You; Desert Island Discs – review|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/jul/27/podcasts-review-radio-miranda-sawyer|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=July 27, 2013|accessdate=19 August 2013|authorlink=Miranda Sawyer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other work===

Blumenfeld starred in the 2009 short film ''[[The Old Man and the Seymour]]'' alongside colleagues Streeter Seidell and Dan Gurewitch, as well as [[Shawn Harrison (actor)|Shawn Harrison]], [[Liz Cackowski]] and [[Jordan Carlos]]. It is about a [[Growth hormone deficiency|growth-hormone deficient]] man who is mistaken for a student at his nephew's [[high school]].

==Influences==

Everybody was funny."&lt;ref name="Haaretz" /&gt; Blumenfeld has said he is influenced by television programs that he watched while growing up, including ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[Seinfeld]]'', and ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', which he says "taught me how to think ... absurdly ... creatively and originally about jokes that people were making" and make "jokes on jokes".&lt;ref name="Lorenzini" /&gt; He has cited [[Larry David]] as an influence,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=King|first=Catherine|title=Jake And Amir Interviewed: From College Humour To Global Domination|url=http://sabotagetimes.com/people/jake-and-amir-interviewed-from-college-humour-to-global-domination/|work=[[Sabotage Times]]|accessdate=September 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also likes ''[[Louie (U.S. TV series)|Louie]]'' and ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]''.&lt;ref name="Variety" /&gt; Blumenfeld has compared the [[NBC]] series ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]'' and ''[[Parks and Recreation]]'' to ''Jake and Amir'', saying they "have these office workplace dynamics and the situations are funny and the characters are very funny".&lt;ref name="Haaretz" /&gt;
