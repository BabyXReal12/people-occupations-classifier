'''Harry Joachim''' (May 22, 1907 &amp;ndash; March 29, 1986),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://m.imdb.com/name/nm0728871/?ref_=m_nmtrv_nm|title=IMDb Entry|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=February 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; known professionally as '''Harry Ritz''' was an American actor and comedian. He was also the youngest of the [[Ritz Brothers]].

==Early life==

Ritz was born Harry Joachim on May 28, 1907 in [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], [[New Jersey]]. He was born the youngest of six children to parents [[Max Joachim|Max]], (December 1871&amp;ndash;January 4, 1939) and [[Pauline Joachim]], (May 1874&amp;ndash;November 26, 1935). His father was born in [[Austria-Hungary]] and owned a [[haberdashery]] and his mother was born in [[Russia]].&lt;ref name=memorial&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/5876|title=Harry Ritz (1907-1986) Find A Grave Memorial|publisher=[[Find a Grave]]|accessdate=February 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ritz was the brother to fellow comedians, (and future comedy partners), [[Albert Ritz|Al]] and [[Jimmy Ritz (comedian)|Jimmy Ritz]]. He also had another brother named George who would become the future manager to the [[Ritz Brothers]] and had a sister named Gertrude Soll.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Vaudeville, Old &amp; New: An Encyclopedia of Variety Performers in America |first=Frank |last=Cullen |first2=Florence |last2=Hackman |lastauthoramp=yes |first3=Donald |last3=McNeilly |location=New York |publisher=Routledge |year=2007 |isbn=0-415-93853-8 |page=935 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

By 1925, and after a full career on Broadway, he and brothers [[Albert Ritz|Al]] and Jimmy decided to team up and form a song/dance-and-comedy act called the ''[[Ritz Brothers]]''. Al chose the name "Ritz"  after seeing it on the side of a laundry truck.&lt;ref name=memorial/&gt;  The brothers would have Harry standing in the middle singing ''The Man in the Middle Is the Funny One'', a song written for them. The other two brothers would then take to berating Harry for occupying that favored spot and, as they screamed their displeasure, Harry would wander about bellowing "Don't holler--please don't holler."&lt;ref name=latimes&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-03-31/news/mn-2095_1_harry-ritz|title= Harry Ritz, 78, Member of Zany Vaudeville Brothers, Dies|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=March 31, 1986|accessdate=February 21, 2015|first=Burt|last=Folkart}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their comedy style was a tandem song and dance, as if they were one.

By 1930 they were playing the Palace where the headliner was [[Frank Fay (American actor)|Frank Fay]] with his bride, [[Barbara Stanwyck]]. By 1934, they had done their first film together as a team, "Hotel Anchovy", all of 18min. long.

They worked in Shubert shows for a time and in 1932 caught the attention of [[Earl Carroll]] who featured them in his ''Vanities'' that year. They were appearing at the old Clover Club on [[Hollywood]]'s [[Sunset Strip]] when [[Darryl F. Zanuck]] reportedly caught the act and signed them to a contract. (Al had appeared earlier in a silent film, ''The Avenging Trail'' in 1918.)

The Ritz Brothers started their Hollywood film career with [[20th Century Fox]] in 1936, starring with [[Alice Faye]] in ''[[Sing, Baby, Sing]]''. Later they were in ''[[One in a Million (1936 film)|One in a Million]]'' with [[Sonja Henie]], ''[[The Three Musketeers (1939 film)|The Three Musketeers]]'' with [[Don Ameche]], ''[[Kentucky Moonshine]]'' and ''[[The Goldwyn Follies]]''.&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/01/obituaries/harry-ritz-78-last-brother-of-slapstick-comedy-team.html|title=HARRY RITZ, 78, LAST BROTHER OF SLAPSTICK COMEDY TEAM|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|work=[[United Press International]]|date=April 1, 1986|accessdate=February 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The brothers left [[20th Century Fox|Fox]] in 1940 and went with rival studio [[Universal Studios|Universal]]. The brothers quit after filming the movie "Never a Dull Moment" in 1943 to concentrate on club dates. The Ritzes, among the first of the big-money acts in [[Las Vegas]], made a few television specials in the early 1950s. They carried their zaniness on the road until 1965 when Al died in [[New Orleans]] where they were performing. Harry and Jimmy stayed together and by 1966 opened the new Caesars Palace in Las Vegas.  They continued to perform, just the two of them, in Florida and upstate New York theaters, cruise ships,  as well as some guest appearances on the Dick Cavett Show, Merv Griffin, etc.  By the 1970s and 1980s, they had some attention in films like Won Ton Ton/the dog who saved Hollywood, Mel Brook's Silent Movie, Blazing Stewardesses, and a one day of shoot on the Warren Beauty film, For Love and Money, with Armand Assante.  Harry was signed on to do two major films just with himself, Godfather 2, and The Sunshine Boys.  Unfortunately, he contracted TB while working on a cruise ship, and had to forfeit his roles.

==Personal life==

Harry was married four times, and had 7 children ( three different mothers) and one granddaughter.

==Death and legacy==

In his last years, Ritz battled with [[cancer]], and [[Alzheimer's disease]]. But Ritz died of [[pneumonia]] on March 29, 1986. He left behind a widow, his children ( including two young daughters with a very young wife), granddaughter and his sister.&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt; Ritz is buried at the [[Hollywood Forever Cemetery]] in [[Los Angeles]].

Ritz, along with his brothers, influenced comedians such as [[Jerry Lewis]], [[Sid Caesar]], [[Mel Brooks]], and [[Danny Kaye]]. Brooks cast Ritz in a cameo in his 1976 movie ''[[Silent Movie]]''. In an interview with [[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire magazine]], Brooks had this to say regarding Ritz;

{{cquote|As far as I'm concerned, Harry Ritz was the funniest man ever. His craziness and his freedom were unmatched. There was no intellectualizing with him. You just hoped there were no pointy objects in the room when he was working 'cause you were down on the floor, spitting, out of control, laughing your brains out. Harry Ritz always put me away. Always.&lt;ref name=esquire&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maryellenmark.com/text/magazines/esquire/911E-000-004.html|title=ESQUIRE -MEL BROOKS SAYS THIS IS THE FUNNIEST MAN IN THE WORLD|publisher=[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]|accessdate=February 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In that same interview, Lewis had this to say about Ritz;

{{cquote|Harry was the teacher. He had the extraordinary ability to deny himself dignity onstage. Harry taught us that the only thing that mattered was getting a laugh â€‘whether you did it with a camel or with two rabbis humping a road map. Harry spawned us all. We all begged, borrowed and stole from him, every one of us. Without him, we wouldn't be here.&lt;ref name=esquire/&gt;}}
