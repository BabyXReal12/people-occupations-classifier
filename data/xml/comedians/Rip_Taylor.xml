He is known for his exuberance and flamboyant personality, including his wild moustache and his habit of showering himself (and others) with confetti.&lt;ref name=greginh&gt;{{cite web| url= http://greginhollywood.com/stage-rip-taylors-surprisingly-serious-it-aint-all-confetti-show-gets-a-star-studded-launch-29043| title= Stage: Rip Taylor’s surprisingly serious 'It Ain't All Confetti' show gets a star-studded launch| first= Greg |last= Hernandez |date= 24 May 2010| website= GregInHollywood.com |accessdate= 23 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PDillerBoggs&gt;{{cite interview| title= Phyllis Diller &amp; Rip Taylor Interview with Bill Boggs| first= Rip |last= Taylor| interviewer= Bill Boggs| publisher= YouTube.com | work= Midday with Bill Boggs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Taylor was born in [[Washington, D.C.]], the son of Elizabeth, a waitress, and Charles Elmer Taylor Sr., a musician.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title= Rip Taylor Biography (1934?-)|publisher=Filmreference|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/87/Rip-Taylor.html|accessdate=October 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As described in his 2010 one-man show ''It Ain't All Confetti'', Taylor had a tough childhood, which included being molested while in foster care and having to deal with bullies in school.&lt;ref name=greginh /&gt; As a young man, Taylor worked as a [[congressional page]]&lt;ref name=greginh /&gt; before serving in the [[Korean War]] while in the [[U.S. Army Signal Corps]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

==Career==

Rip Taylor's career in show business began after he joined the U.S. Army, where he started performing stand-up in clubs and restaurants abroad. Although a lot of his material were jokes stolen from acts he saw in USO shows, his signature piece would be to pretend to cry as he begged the audience to laugh. From there, he was able to land a spot on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', making close to 20 appearances. According to Taylor, [[Ed Sullivan|Sullivan]]  would forget his name but used to say, "Get me the crying comedian."&lt;ref name=UPI&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.upi.com/Archives/1992/08/26/Rip-Taylor-the-carefree-be-wigged-and-maniacal-confetti-tossing-comedian/5025714801600| title= Rip Taylor, the carefree, be-wigged and maniacal confetti-tossing comedian| first= Vernon |last= Scott |date= 26 August 1992| accessdate= 23 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television/film career===
In addition to the ''Ed Sullivan Show'', Taylor appeared on ''[[The Jackie Gleason Show#American Scene Magazine|The Jackie Gleason Show]]'' in several guest appearances during the 1963-64 season as "the crying comedian."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|page= 99|last= Erickson| first= Hal |title=Sid and Marty Krofft: A Critical Study of Saturday Morning Children's Television, 1969-1993| publisher= McFarland| date= 1 January 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He appeared in two 1968 episodes of ''[[The Monkees (TV series)|The Monkees]]'' as well as having a cameo in the 1969 special ''33 1/3 Revolutions per Monkee''. He continued to work as a voice performer in the 1970s cartoon series ''[[Here Comes the Grump]]'' (as the title character) and in the second ''[[The Addams Family (1992 animated series)|The Addams Family]]'' cartoon series (as [[Uncle Fester]]).

Throughout the 1970s, Taylor was a frequent celebrity guest panelist on TV game shows such as ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'', ''[[To Tell the Truth]]'', and ''[[The Gong Show]]'', and substituted for [[Charles Nelson Reilly]] on ''[[The Match Game]].'' He became a regular on [[Sid and Marty Krofft]]'s ''[[Sigmund and the Sea Monsters]]'', playing Sheldon, a sea-genie who lived in a conch shell. In addition, Taylor was also a regular on ''[[The Brady Bunch Hour]]'',&lt;ref name=greginh /&gt; playing a role of neighbor/performer Jack Merrill. He also hosted a short-lived send-up of beauty pageants called ''[[The $1.98 Beauty Show]]'', created by ''Gong Show'' producer/host [[Chuck Barris]], in 1978. Taylor appeared as a celebrity on the 1990 version of ''Match Game''. In 1979, he was the voice of C.J. from the [[Hanna-Barbera]] TV movie ''[[Scooby Goes Hollywood]]''. Other appearances include the television show ''[[The Kids in the Hall]]''. He was referred to as Uncle Rip by [[Buddy Cole (character)|Buddy Cole,]] one of the show's characters. He also appeared as himself in the movie ''[[Wayne's World 2]]'', one of the special guests invited to "WayneStock" after being visited in a dream by [[Jim Morrison]].

Taylor appeared uncredited on a December 1994 edition of ''[[WWE Raw|WWF Monday Night Raw]]'' to assist in a push being given to [[Jeff Jarrett]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prowrestling.net/site/2015/12/21/wwe-raw-retro-coverage-december-19-1994-lex-luger-vs-irs-the-smoking-gunns-jim-neidhart-bob-holly-the-bushwhackers/|title=WWE Raw Retro Coverage – December 19, 1994: Lex Luger vs. IRS, The Smoking Gunns, Jim Neidhart, Bob Holly, The Bushwhackers|website=Pro Wrestling Dot Net|date=December 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, Taylor appeared in a segment on the show ''[[Beyond Belief: Fact or Fiction]]''. He played the role of Elmo Middleton in the segment "The Man in the [[Model T]]". Also in 1997, he appeared as himself on the sitcom ''[[Brotherly Love (1995 TV series)|Brotherly Love]]'' in the episode "Easy Come Easy Go".  He also portrayed Chief Undersecretary Wartle in the graphical adventure game ''[[Zork: Grand Inquisitor]]'' in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0132641/ Zork: Grand Inquisitor (Video Game 1997)] at the Internet Movie Database&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, Taylor also appeared as himself on ''[[Will &amp; Grace]]''.

He made a special guest appearance at the end of the 1,000th episode of [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4]]'s video game review show ''[[X-Play]]''. He made a guest appearance on a 2012 episode of ''[[The Aquabats! Super Show!]]'', where he played a genie reminiscent of his character on ''Sigmund and the Sea Monsters''. 
[[File:RipTaylorDorisRobertsNov10.jpg|left|thumb|259x259px|Rip Taylor and [[Doris Roberts]] in the Green Room at the [[Marilyn Monroe]] Theatre after a performance of ''Barrymore''.]]
Taylor is an accomplice of the ''[[Jackass (TV series)|Jackass]]'' crew. In 1995, he performed the intro for the [[Bloodhound Gang]]'s ''[[Use Your Fingers]]'' album, and in 2002, he appeared in the final scene of ''[[Jackass: The Movie]]'', wielding a pistol that, when fired, released a sign that read "The End." (Taylor's section of the film was originally considerably longer, and ended with him complaining about the heat, and fanning himself with his [[toupée]]. This footage was included on the DVD of the film.) He did the same thing at the ending of ''[[Jackass Number Two]]'' and ''[[Jackass 3D]]''. In the credits of the 2005 remake of ''[[The Dukes of Hazzard]]'', Taylor shows up in the [[blooper|blooper reel]].

Taylor has made occasional appearances in movies, usually in broad comedies like ''[[The Happy Hooker Goes to Washington]]'' (1977) and the R-rated ''[[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]]'' parody ''[[Chatterbox (1977 film)|Chatterbox]]'' (1977).&lt;ref&gt;[http://dailygrindhouse.com/thewire/yes-real-movie-chatterbox-1977/ Yes, It’s a Real Movie!: Chatterbox (1977)] at dailygrindhouse.com&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Cheech and Chong]]'s ''[[Things Are Tough All Over]]'' (1982), he picks them up in the middle of nowhere driving a convertible full of props. Rip then proceeds to drive them to Las Vegas and telling jokes the whole way and moving Chong to tears from laughter (and, later, tears because he won`t stop). In ''[[Amazon Women on the Moon]]'' (1987) a funeral service turns into a [[Roast (comedy)|celebrity roast]] when guest Rip Taylor shows up to "honor" the deceased. In 1993, Taylor appeared in ''[[Tom and Jerry: The Movie]]'' (1992) as Captain Kiddle and in ''[[Wayne's World 2]]''. In 1993's ''[[Indecent Proposal]]'' as Demi Moore's boss, he appears without his toupee. He was also in the 1990 summer movie ''[[DuckTales the Movie: Treasure of the Lost Lamp]]'' as the voice of the Genie.

===Live theater===
Taylor's first big live show was in 1966, when he went on a tour with [[Judy Garland]] and [[Eleanor Powell]] in Las Vegas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|  url= https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0853067/bio |title= Rip Taylor Biography | website= IMDB.com| publisher= Internet Movie Database| accessdate= 23 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1981, Taylor appeared on Broadway when he replaced [[Mickey Rooney]] in the burlesque-themed musical comedy ''[[Sugar Babies (musical)|Sugar Babies]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/29/theater/rip-taylor-barges-in-for-rooney.html| title= RIP TAYLOR BARGES IN FOR ROONEY| first= Jennifer |last= Dunning |date= 29 June 1981| accessdate= 23 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a frequent co-star with [[Debbie Reynolds]] in her live shows in Las Vegas, [[Reno, Nevada|Reno]], and [[Lake Tahoe]]. Taylor performed frequently in Atlantic City as well.&lt;ref name=PDillerBoggs /&gt; In 2010, he appeared in the one-man show ''It Ain't All Confetti'' in [[North Hollywood]], where he shared personal stories about his life and career.&lt;ref name=greginh /&gt;

==Personal life==
In 2006, Taylor appeared as the grand marshal of Washington, D.C.'s [[Capital Pride (Washington, D.C.)|Capital Pride]] parade.&lt;ref name=DCPride&gt;{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928011948/http://www.washblade.com/blog/index.cfm?blog_id=1080 |date=September 28, 2007 |title=Getting 'Ripped' at D.C. Pride }} (archived from [http://www.washblade.com/blog/index.cfm?blog_id=1080 the original])&lt;/ref&gt; Although he has been referred to as "openly gay",&lt;ref name=newnownext&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.newnownext.com/ask-the-flying-monkey-may-20-2009/05/2009/ |title=Ask the Flying Monkey |author=Brent Hartinger |date=May 20, 2009 |website=www.newnownext.com |publisher=NewNowNext|access-date=November 13, 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a 2009 interview for "Ask the Flying Monkey", [[Brent Hartinger]] recalls receiving an email from Taylor stating: "You don’t know me to summarize that I am openly gay. I don’t know that you’re not an openly heroin user. You see how that works? Think before you write." Taylor was married to showgirl Rusty Rowe but later divorced.&lt;ref name=film&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.filmreference.com/film/87/Rip-Taylor.html |title=Rip Taylor Biography |author=|date=November 13, 2016 |website=www.filmreference.com |publisher=Film Reference|access-date=November 13, 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=stage&gt;{{cite web |url= http://thisstage.la/2010/05/it-aint-all-confetti-rip-taylor-lets-it-rip/ |title=It Ain't All Confetti: Rip Taylor Lets It Rip |author=Camille Saviola |date= May 20, 2010 |website=www.thisstage.la |publisher=This Stage Magazine|access-date=November 13, 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=newspage&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/144138344/ |title=It Ain't All Confetti: Rip Taylor Finds Zaniness the Key to a Long Career |author= |date= February 22, 1987 |website=www.newspapers.com |publisher=Asbury Park Press|access-date=November 13, 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
