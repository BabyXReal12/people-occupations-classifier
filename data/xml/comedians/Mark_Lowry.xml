'''Mark Alan Lowry''' (born June 24, 1958) is an American Christian singer, comedian, and songwriter. He is known for co-writing the song "[[Mary, Did You Know?]]" and being a member of the [[Gaither Vocal Band]] from 1988 to 2001, and 2009 to 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gaither.com/news/announcing-gaither-vocal-band-personnel-changes|title=Announcing... Gaither Vocal Band Personnel Changes|last=Music|first=Gaither|website=Gaither Music|access-date=2016-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with [[Michael English (American singer)|Michael English]], [[David Phelps (musician)|David Phelps]] and [[Bill Gaither (gospel singer)|Bill Gaither]]. Lowry has recorded twelve albums,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://marklowry.com/product-category/album/|title=Album {{!}} Product Categories {{!}} Mark Lowry {{!}} Official Website|website=marklowry.com|access-date=2016-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; both music and comedy.

==Early life==
Lowry was born in [[Houston]], [[Texas]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/artists/mark-lowry/biography/|title=Mark Lowry Bio {{!}} Mark Lowry Career|newspaper=MTV Artists|access-date=2016-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; to Charles, an attorney, and Beverly Lowry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://prezi.com/tbo9hzoedebu/mark-lowry/|title=Mark Lowry|website=prezi.com|access-date=2016-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; He often uses anecdotes of his young life in his comedy, as well as speaking of his experience with hyperactivity and [[Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder|attention deficit disorder]] in his performances. He is a self-described "Poster Boy for Hyperactivity".

==Early career==
While attending Liberty Baptist College (now known as [[Liberty University]]), Lowry joined a college evangelistic team made of Charles Hughes and David Musselman and began singing.  His comedy career inadvertently began from here. There would be an elongated pause in his singing performance while he waited for the soundtrack to be changed. Lowry began to fill this pause with a [[monologue]]. He soon realized that the audiences at his performances were laughing not at him but at his monologues.

In 1978, Lowry was badly injured in a car accident near [[Carlisle, Pennsylvania]], while touring with his college evangelistic team.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://prezi.com/tbo9hzoedebu/mark-lowry/|title=Mark Lowry|website=prezi.com|access-date=2016-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; He sustained eleven broken bones, and spent a good deal of time in physical therapy recovering from the accident.

=="Mary, Did You Know?"==
In 1984, Lowry wrote the lyrics to the song "[[Mary, Did You Know?]]", when asked to write a script for a church Christmas play. He wrote a series of questions that he would like to ask [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary, the mother of Jesus]]. These questions were used in between the scenes of the play. Over the next decade, Lowry tried to find music that would complete the song. Eventually, musician and songwriter [[Buddy Greene]] wrote the music to the song. The Christmas play script then became the song.

The song has become a popular Christmas song performed by more than thirty artists including [[Cee Lo Green]], [[Clay Aiken]], [[Kenny Rogers]], [[Wynonna Judd]], [[Michael English (American singer)|Michael English]], [[Daniel Childs]], [[Natalie Cole]],  Pippa Wilson&lt;ref&gt;[http://pippawilson.com/cd/cd_3.htm Pippa Wilson]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kathy Mattea]], [[Michael Crawford]], [[Zara Larsson]], [[Peter Hollens]], and [[Pentatonix]].

==The Gaither Vocal Band==

In 1988, Lowry was approached by [[Bill Gaither (gospel singer)|Bill Gaither]] and asked to join the [[Gaither Vocal Band]] as the [[baritone]].  Lowry's career with the band spanned thirteen years during his first stint with the group. His on-stage antics were popular with audiences. As a result, he became the co-host of the many concerts and shows performed by Gaither and the Vocal Band, with Gaither playing the [[Double act|straight man]] to Lowry's antics.

In June 2001, Lowry resigned from the Gaither Vocal Band after performing longer with the group than any previous member except  Gaither himself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marklowry.com/newsletter/remarks/2001remarks/remarks_125.htm Mark Lowry â€“ reMarks newsletter&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110404224454/http://www.marklowry.com/newsletter/remarks/2001remarks/remarks_125.htm |date=2011-04-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After that, Lowry released several solo albums, including ''[[I Love to Tell the Story, A Hymns Collection]]''.

On January 14, 2009, it was announced that Lowry would be returning to the Gaither Vocal Band while maintaining his solo career.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marklowry.com/newsletter/remarks/2009remarks/remarks_167.htm Mark Lowry â€“ reMarks newsletter&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714035548/http://www.marklowry.com/newsletter/remarks/2009remarks/remarks_167.htm |date=2011-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In October 2013, it was announced that Lowry and [[Michael English (American singer)|Michael English]] would be leaving the group to devote more time to their solo careers. Lowry stayed on through the end of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gaither Vocal Band Announce Departure Of Mark Lowry And Michael English|url=http://www.singingnews.com/Southern-Gospel-News/11701183/|accessdate=November 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Videos==
Lowry's first video was ''Mark Lowry: My First Comedy Video'' made in 1988. Next, he made ''Mark Lowry: The Last Word'' in 1992 at the Tivoli Theatre in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]]. He taped ''Mark Lowry: Mouth in Motion'' in 1993 at Carpenter's Home Church in Lakeland, Florida. The album won a [[Dove Award]] for Long Form Music Video of the Year at the [[25th GMA Dove Awards]] in 1994. He made ''Mark Lowry: Remotely Controlled'' in 1995. ''Mark Lowry on Broadway'' was performed and captured to DVD at the Beacon Theatre in NYC in 2000, and ''Mark Lowry Goes to Hollywood'' was performed and captured to DVD at the Cerritos Center in Cerritos, California, in January 2005.

==Current projects==
Lowry continues to tour the United States performing his music and comedy concerts as well as recording music and comedy CD albums and videos. He records and publishes several iPod podcasts, including ''Saturdays with Mark and Tony'', a weekly podcast with [[Tony Campolo]]. He co-hosts ''Bill Gaither's Homecoming Radio'' with Bill Gaither and Phil Brower. Starting in March 2011, he has been a frequent co-host of the TV show ''Red Letter Christians'' with [[Tony Campolo]].

==Family==
Lowry is single and has no children. He has a brother, sister, three nieces and three nephews.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://prezi.com/tbo9hzoedebu/mark-lowry/|title=Mark Lowry|website=prezi.com|access-date=2016-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
