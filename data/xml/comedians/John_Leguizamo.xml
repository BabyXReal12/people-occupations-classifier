==Early life==
Leguizamo was born in [[Bogotá, Colombia]], the son of Alberto and Luz Leguizamo. His father was once an aspiring film director and studied at [[Cinecittà]], but eventually dropped out due to lack of finances.&lt;ref&gt;Leguizamo, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; According to Leguizamo, his paternal grandfather was of [[Italians|Italian]] and [[Puerto Ricans|Puerto Rican]] descent,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Leguizamo| first = John| title = Pimps, Hos, Playa Hatas, And All the Rest of My Hollywood Friends: My Life| publisher = [[HarperCollins|Ecco]]| location = New York| year = 2006| page = 8| isbn = 0-06-052071-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his maternal grandmother was [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]].&lt;ref&gt;Leguizamo, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; He has also described himself as being of [[Amerindian]] and [[Mestizo]] heritage.&lt;ref name="wp"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F00E1DB1F3AF93BA35751C0A96E958260&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss|title=THEATER; In Town, on the Edge: Listening In on Solo Acts|date=February 8, 1998|author=Leguizamo, John|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=November 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 10, 2011, Leguizamo's father declared in an interview with New York Hispanic newspaper ''El Diario'' that he is [[Colombians|Colombian]] and not Puerto Rican, and that Leguizamo is therefore not half Puerto Rican as he has always stated.&lt;ref name="FN"/&gt; Leguizamo had always declared that he was Puerto Rican on his father's side, which was one of the reasons he was selected as the [[Puerto Rican Day Parade]] Global Ambassador of the Arts. In response to his father's allegations, Leguizamo reiterated that his grandfather was of Puerto Rican descent.&lt;ref name="FN"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gratereaux|first=Alexandra|title=Leguizamo’s Dad: John's Not Puerto Rican!|url=http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/entertainment/2011/06/10/leguizamos-dad-johns-not-puerto-rican/|work=[[Fox News Latino]]|accessdate=September 8, 2011|date=October 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A National Puerto Rican Day Parade spokesman stated that Leguizamo would keep his ambassadorship. He marched in the parade on June 12, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Huge crowd for Puerto Rican parade|url=http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_york&amp;id=8184052|work=[[Eyewitness News]]|publisher=[[WABC-TV]]|date=June 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Leguizamo was four years old, his family immigrated to [[New York City]],&lt;ref&gt;Leguizamo, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; where they lived in various neighborhoods in [[Queens]], including [[Jackson Heights, Queens|Jackson Heights]].&lt;ref name="wp"&gt;Zook, Kristal Brent.

There were lots of fights. I would walk through a park and be attacked, and I had to defend myself all the time. But this helped me to become funny so that I wouldn’t get hit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Singh|first=Anita|title=Hay Festival Cartagena: John Leguizamo on Hollywood|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/hay-festival/9043565/Hay-Festival-Cartagena-John-Leguizamo-on-Hollywood.html|accessdate=January 31, 2012|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=January 31, 2012|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leguizamo attended the [[Joseph Pulitzer Middle School]] (I.S.145) and later the [[Murry Bergtraum High School]]. As a student at Murry Bergtraum, he wrote comedy material and tested it on his classmates. He was voted "Most Talkative" by his classmates. After graduating from high school, he began his theater career as an undergraduate at NYU's [[Tisch School of the Arts]], from which he eventually dropped out in favor of a career in stand-up comedy. Post-NYU, Leguizamo enrolled at [[LIU Post]], where he took theater classes.

==Career==
===Early career===
Leguizamo started out as a stand-up comic doing the New York nightclub circuit in 1984. He made his television debut in 1986 with a small part in ''[[Miami Vice]]''. His other early roles include: a friend of [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s boyfriend in her "[[Borderline (Madonna song)|Borderline]]" video (1984); ''Mixed Blood'' (1985), ''[[Casualties of War (film)|Casualties of War]]'' (1989), a terrorist in ''[[Die Hard 2]]'' (1990), ''[[Hangin' with the Homeboys]]'' (1991), the robber in ''[[Regarding Henry]]'' (1991), ''[[Super Mario Bros (film)|Super Mario Bros]]'' (1993), and ''[[Night Owl (film)|Night Owl]]'' (1993).

===Film===
[[File:John Leguizamo 2 by David Shankbone.jpg|upright|thumb|Leguizamo at the 2010 [[Tribeca Film Festival]]]]

In 1992, he starred in ''[[Whispers in the Dark (film)|Whispers in the Dark]]'' as John Castillo. In 1993 Leguizamo was offered the lead part as [[Luigi]] in the film ''[[Super Mario Bros (film)|Super Mario Bros.]]'', based on the [[Mario]] video game franchise. Despite being considered a critical and financial failure universally, the film started his acting career in Hollywood and became one of his memorable roles. It also provided a boost to his career, allowing him to appear in better comedic roles in the following years. That same year, he had a prominent role in [[Brian De Palma]]'s ''[[Carlito's Way]]'' as Carlito Brigante's nemesis, "Benny Blanco from the Bronx," which also boosted his career in serious roles.

Leguizamo also starred in ''[[Romeo + Juliet]]'' as [[Tybalt]] Capulet, as [[Violator (comics)|Violator]] in ''[[Spawn (film)|Spawn]]'', Cholo in ''[[Land of the Dead]]'', and Pestario 'Pest' Vargas in ''[[The Pest (1997 film)|The Pest]]'', the latter being one of his few roles as a lead actor in a studio film. In 1995, he starred as drag queen Chi-Chi Rodriguez in ''[[To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar]]'' for which he received a Golden Globe Nomination for Best Supporting Actor, and starred in the 1996 action film ''[[Executive Decision]]'' as Captain Rat. In 2002, he starred in the movie ''[[Empire (2002 film)|Empire]]''.
To promote the 2001 movie ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'', he appeared on a celebrity edition of the US version of ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? (U.S. game show)|Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]]'' with [[Kelly Ripa]], [[Kevin Sorbo]], [[Alfre Woodard]], [[Martin Short]] and [[Chevy Chase]]. Appearing as the first celebrity to sit in the hot seat, he eventually tried for $125,000, but got the answer wrong. Later in 2002, on the syndicated version, a question about the movie featured his character and [[Meredith Vieira]] mentioned that Leguizamo had played Lautrec and had been on the show.

In 2002, he voiced [[Sid (Ice Age)|Sid the Sloth]] for the film ''[[Ice Age (2002 film)|Ice Age]]'', reprising the role for the sequels ''[[Ice Age: The Meltdown]]'', ''[[Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs]]'', ''[[Ice Age: Continental Drift]]'' and ''[[Ice Age: Collision Course]]''. The game versions of the films also used his voice. In 2003, he voice-acted [[Globox]] from ''[[Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc]]''. Leguizamo portrayed Paul in the [[Brad Anderson (director)|Brad Anderson]] thriller film ''[[Vanishing on 7th Street]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/37581/first-images-brad-andersons-the-vanishing-7th-street|title=First Images: Brad Anderson's The Vanishing on 7th Street|publisher=DreadCentral}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2007, he played Michael Beltran in the movie ''[[The Babysitters]]''. In 2008, he co-starred in the movie ''[[The Happening (2008 film)|The Happening]]'', written and directed by [[M. Night Shyamalan]].&lt;ref name="Playbill happening"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gans|first1=Andrew|title="The Happening," with Wahlberg, Leguizamo and Buckley, Opens Wide June 13|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/the-happening-with-wahlberg-leguizamo-and-buckley-opens-wide-june-13-150842|work=Playbill|accessdate=January 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 Leguizamo starred alongside [[Jon Favreau]] in ''[[Chef (2014 film)|Chef]]'' as the line cook Martin, a role he prepared for by working as an actual line cook at ''The Lion'' in the [[West Village]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.grubstreet.com/2014/05/chef-cast-on-cooking.html&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2014, he played a drug dealer in the Jesse Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart movie ''[[American Ultra]]''.

===Television===
In 1995 Leguizamo created, produced, wrote, and starred in the 1995 Latino-oriented variety show called ''[[House of Buggin']]'' on [[Fox Television]]. Some audiences saw this as the Latino version of ''[[In Living Color]]''. The show showcased Leguizamo's well-known ability to assume a wide variety of colorful, energetic characters, but due to poor ratings the show ran less than one season.

In 2000, Leguizamo portrayed both [[Genie]]s in ''[[Arabian Nights (TV miniseries)|Arabian Nights]]'', a TV mini-series adaptation of the epic ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]''.

During the 2005–06 television season, Leguizamo joined the cast of the show ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'', playing the emotionally disturbed Dr. [[Victor Clemente]], a new attending who is keen on introducing the staff of County General to better ways of treating patients and cutting-edge technology. Clemente, however, was plagued with personal problems and was fired from the hospital near the end of the season. Dr. Clemente's departure from the show was a blessing for Leguizamo. He revealed to [[CraveOnline]] that he was not happy working on the television program. "I was depressed doing ''ER''," he admitted, "I started gaining weight, I was eating doughnuts, I started smoking again. I’m eating McDonald's, things that I know when I’m depressed I do. I tried to kill myself internally."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bibbiani |first=William |url=http://www.craveonline.com/filmtv/articles/04648255/kill_point_john_leguizamo.html |title=Kill Point: John Leguizamo |publisher=Craveonline.com |accessdate=October 8, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024081904/http://www.craveonline.com/filmtv/articles/04648255/kill_point_john_leguizamo.html |archivedate=October 24, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, he guest starred on ''[[Dora the Explorer]]'' as Captain Pirate Piggy. In 2006, Leguizamo starred in the television pilot for ''Edison,'' a 2006 [[CBS]] drama about an Los Angeles [[detective]] (played by Leguizamo) who relied on impersonations and disguises to solve crimes. Other cast members included [[Currie Graham]] and Deidrie Henry. [[Kevin Rodney Sullivan]] directed from a script by Ron Milbauer and Terri Hughes. Leguizamo and [[David Hoberman]] also served as executive producers.

In July 2007, [[Spike TV]] aired its drama series ''[[The Kill Point]]'', which starred Leguizamo, [[Donnie Wahlberg]], and [[Michael Hyatt]]. The show was an eight-part series revolving around ex-war veterans whose bank robbery went wrong, thus ending in a hostage situation. Despite high ratings, ''The Kill Point'' was not renewed for a second season.

In 2008, Leguizamo guest starred on ''[[Sesame Street]]'' as Captain Vegetable as he encourages Elmo to eat his vegetables. 

In 2010, Leguizamo also guest starred on ''[[The Electric Company (2009 TV series)|The Electric Company]]'' as himself, rhyming about commas and quotation marks.

In 2012, Leguizamo was cast as Derek Trotter in the American remake of the British BBC sitcom ''[[Only Fools and Horses]]''.

In 2016, he played the role Ozzy Delvecchio in the second season of the [[Netflix]] original series ''[[Bloodline (TV series)|Bloodline]]''.

In 1998, he debuted on Broadway in the production of ''[[Freak (film)|Freak]]'', a semi-autobiographical one-person play that was recorded for HBO and released on October 10, 1998, with [[Spike Lee]] sitting in as director. The show won him the [[Drama Desk Award for Outstanding One-Person Show]].

===On record===
In 2001, RCA/BMG Records released ''John Leguizamo LIVE'', a CD compilation of Leguizamo's stage routines. Among the bits are a primer Leguizamo gives on the history and culture of Latinos in America, which with the dubious tale of the mating of an Inca princess with a Spanish conquistador, thus creating the original dysfunctional Latin family, each member of which is voiced by Leguizamo. The CD also includes a musical intermission, with two salsa/hip-hop tunes, "The Night Before Christmas" and "Gotta Get Some", and footage from Leguizamo's tours and two interactive games, "Spanish Fly Pick-Up Line".

In late 2017, Leguizamo sang on "[[Almost Like Praying]]", a charitable written and composed by [[Lin-Manuel Miranda]]. Proceeds from the song went to the [[Hispanic Federation]] to assist relief efforts for those in Puerto Rico who were affected by [[Hurricane Maria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/veronicavillafane/2017/10/06/lin-manuel-miranda-releases-star-studded-almost-like-praying-song-for-puerto-rico-hurricane-relief/|title=Lin-Manuel Miranda Releases Star-Studded 'Almost Like Praying' Song For Puerto Rico Hurricane Relief|last=Villafañe|first=Veronica|work=Forbes|access-date=2017-10-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Books===
In October 2006, Leguizamo's memoir, ''Pimps, Hos, Playa Hatas and All the Rest of My Hollywood Friends: My Life'', was released. During an interview on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'', he stated that his memoir was very candid about experiences involving other celebrities he had worked with. He stated that working with [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] on ''[[Collateral Damage (film)|Collateral Damage]]'' (2002) was one of the most enjoyable experiences he'd had as an actor, that Schwarzenegger's accent let him say things that others would think were [[sexist]] or [[homophobic]] if said by someone else, that [[Steven Seagal]] was an egotist with [[diva]] tendencies, that [[Kurt Russell]] continuously called him a "faggot", and that [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] was a "patron of prostitutes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://radaronline.com/exclusives/2008/10/john-leguizamo-trashes-everyone-hes-ever-worked-with/ |title=Fresh Intelligence : Radar Online : John Leguizamo Trashes Everyone He's Ever Worked With |publisher=Radar Online |date=October 27, 2008 |accessdate=October 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2015, Abrams ComicArts published the [[graphic novel]] adaptation of Leguizamo's one-man Broadway show, ''Ghetto Klown''. As with the live show, the graphic novel explores the actor/comedian's life and career, beginning with his adolescence in [[Queens, New York]], his involvement in '80s avant-garde theater, his feature film career, and some of the colorful characters he encountered throughout his life. Leguizamo describes the work thusly: "''Ghetto Klown'' is the history that I probably never should have told anyone but my therapist, but it's a real lesson that even if you suffer a certain amount (a lot) of self-doubt and anxiety, you can still accomplish great things. It’s a lesson I'm really excited to impart to a whole new audience." The comic  is illustrated by Christo Cassano.&lt;ref&gt;Parkin, JK (January 1, 2015).
