'''Timothy Lee "Tim" Reid'''&lt;ref name=filmr/&gt; (born December 19, 1944) is an [[United States|American]] [[actor]] and [[film director]] best known for his roles in [[prime time]] American [[television program]]s, such as [[Venus Flytrap (WKRP in Cincinnati)|Venus Flytrap]] on ''[[WKRP in Cincinnati]]'' (1978–82), Marcel "Downtown" Brown on ''[[Simon &amp; Simon]]'' (1983–87), Ray Campbell on ''[[Sister, Sister (TV series)|Sister, Sister]]'' (1994–99) and William Barnett on ''[[That '70s Show]]'' (2004&amp;ndash;06). Reid starred in a CBS series, ''[[Frank's Place]]'', as a professor who inherits a Louisiana restaurant. Reid is the founder and president of Legacy Media Institute, a non-profit organization "dedicated to bringing together leading professionals in the film and television industry, outstanding actors, and young men and women who wish to pursue a career in the entertainment media".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legacymediainstitute.org/seminars-and-workshops/2010-summer-workshop-scheduled/ Legacy Media Institute.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Reid was born in [[Norfolk, Virginia]], and raised in the Crestwood area of [[Chesapeake, Virginia]], formerly [[Norfolk County, Virginia]]. He is the son of Augustine (née Wilkins) and William Lee Reid.&lt;ref name=filmr&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/71/Tim-Reid.html|title=Tim Reid Biography (1944-)|publisher=Film Reference|accessdate=June 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He earned his [[Bachelor of Business Administration]] at [[Norfolk State University|Norfolk State College]] in 1968. Reid also became a member of [[Alpha Phi Alpha]] fraternity. After graduation, he was hired by [[Dupont Corporation]], where he worked for three years.&lt;ref name="mbc"&gt;[http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/R/htmlR/reidtim/reidtim.htm Tim Reid profile], [[Museum of Broadcast Communications]] website; accessed January 11, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reid's entertainment career also began in 1968. He and insurance salesman [[Tom Dreesen]] met at a [[Junior Chamber of Commerce]] meeting near Chicago.&lt;ref name="cnn"&gt;Todd Leopold, [http://www.cnn.com/2008/SHOWBIZ/books/10/02/tim.and.tom/index.html "'WKRP' vet Reid, standup Dreesen's previous life"], [[CNN]], October 2, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  They were "put together to promote an anti-drug program in the local schools" and, prompted by a comment from a child, decided to form a comedy team.&lt;ref name="cnn"/&gt;  The team, later billed as "[[Tim and Tom]]", was the first interracial [[Double act|comedy duo]]. Years later, Reid and Dreesen wrote a book about those years called ''Tim &amp; Tom: An American Comedy in Black and White'' (2008, {{ISBN|978-0-226-70900-0}}), co-written with sports writer Ron Rapoport).&lt;ref&gt;[http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/T/bo5631126.html ''Tim and Tom''] page at The University Press of Chicago.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005347/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm "Tim Reid Biography"] at IMDb.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Television acting career==
Reid started out on the short-lived ''[[The Richard Pryor Show]]''. Reid starred as DJ "[[Venus Flytrap (WKRP in Cincinnati)|Venus Flytrap]]" on the hit CBS sitcom ''[[WKRP in Cincinnati]]'', in what is perhaps his best known TV role. Reid starred as Lieutenant Marcel Proust "Downtown" Brown (episodes 43-127), on the [[CBS]] detective series ''[[Simon &amp; Simon]]''. In 1988, Reid won an award from Viewers for Quality Television Awards as "Best Actor in a Quality Comedy Series" in ''[[Frank's Place]]''. In 1988, the same role earned him an [[NAACP Image Award|Image Award]] for "Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bronzefest.com/guests.html Tim Reid profile]; accessed November 26, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reid appeared in the [[It (miniseries)|initial movie version]] of [[Stephen King]]'s epic horror novel ''[[It (novel)|It]]''. He played the role of Mike Hanlon, librarian at the Derry, Maine Public Library and one of the seven main protagonists. Though he admitted having a great time working on the project, Reid later expressed his disappointment with the fact that his character was absent from the climatic showdown against the titular villain (played by [[Tim Curry]]). He made an appearance as Sgt. Ray Bennett of the Seacouver Police Department in three first-season episodes of ''[[Highlander: The Series]]''. He had a starring role in the series ''[[Sister, Sister (TV series)|Sister Sister]]'' as Ray Campbell, for the entire six-season run. On April 13, 2009, Reid appeared opposite former co-star [[Tamera Mowry]] on the short-lived [[Freeform (TV channel)|ABC Family]] series ''[[Roommates (TV series)|Roommates]]'' as Mr Daniels. Reid had a recurring role on ''[[That '70s Show]]'' as William Barnett.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|id=0005347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Directing==
Reid has directed various television programs as well the film ''[[Once Upon a Time...When We Were Colored]]'' based on a novel by Clifton L. Taulbert. He directed and adapted a children's TV show called ''[[Bobobobs]]'' which aired in the late 1980s. Reid is the creator of [[Stop the Madness]], an after-school special video in the fight against drugs recorded on December 11, 1985.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5zJvX3pIY4 ""STOP THE MADNESS" (1985, 1986) anti-drug music video"], YouTube.&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Millennium Studios ==
Tim and Daphne Maxwell Reid built New Millennium Studios in 1997.  Located in Petersburg, Virginia the 57.4-acre site with its 14,850-square-foot sound studio was both the only Black owned film studio in the United States since the 1930s, but also one of the largest independent film studios outside of Hollywood.

New Millennium Studios was used in dozens of movie and television productions, including scenes from the 2001 film "Hearts in Atlantis," of the Stephen King novel; parts of 2000's "The Contender," and elements of Steven Spielberg's 2012 film, "Lincoln," were all shot there. The Reids also produced feature films of their own.

Due to "a lack of incentives in the state" to bring film production to Virginia, the Reids sold the property in March 2015 for $1.475 million to Four Square Property Management LLC, a company formed by Four Square Industrial Constructors, based in Chester, Virginia.

==Personal life==
In 1966, Reid married Rita Ann Sykes; they divorced on May 9, 1980. They have two children together: Timothy II (born 1968) and Tori Reid (born 1971). On December 4, 1982, he married actress [[Daphne Maxwell Reid]]. Reid was named to the board of directors of the American Civil War Center in July 2011 at [[Tredegar Iron Works]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://thisweekinthecivilwar.com/?p=606 "Actor, studio founder Tim Reid named to board of Virginia Civil War center"], This Week in the Civil War, This Week in the Civil War.&lt;/ref&gt; On May 10, 2014, Reid received a VCU honorary doctorate for his many outstanding and distinguished contributions. He delivered a commencement speech during the ceremony.  During the 1980s and 1990s Reid served on the advisory board of the [[National Student Film Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Editor|title=National Student Film Institute/L.A:  The Sixteenth Annual Los Angeles Student Film Festival|date=June 10, 1994|location=The Directors Guild Theatre|pages=10–11|accessdate=6 January 2018|ref=Program}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Editor|title=Los Angeles Student Film Institute: 13th Annual Student Film Festival|date=June 7, 1991|location=The Directors Guild Theatre|page=3|accessdate=6 January 2018|ref=Program}}&lt;/ref&gt;
