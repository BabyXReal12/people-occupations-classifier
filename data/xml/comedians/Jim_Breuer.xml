==Early life==
Breuer was born and raised in [[Valley Stream, New York|Valley Stream]], New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starpulse.com/Actors/Breuer,_Jim/Biography/ |title=Jim Breuer Biography |publisher=Starpulse.com |date=June 21, 1967 |accessdate=August 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was a veteran of [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dodlive.mil/index.php/2014/03/bacon-brothers-jim-breuer-honor-fathers-by-supporting-troops/ |title=Bacon Brothers, Jim Breuer Honor Fathers by Supporting Troops  |publisher=DoDLive 
|date=March 25, 2014 |accessdate=June 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Television career===
Breuer's career began on the little-known ''Uptown Comedy Club'' weekly television show, based in Harlem, New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGf-GtRtH6c |title=YouTube |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2014-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He then joined the a cast of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' from 1995 to 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comedians.comedycentral.com/jim-breuer |title=Jim Breuer: Stand Up Videos and Funny Clips &amp;#124; Comedy Central's Jokes.com |publisher=Comedians.comedycentral.com |date= |accessdate=August 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On ''SNL'', Breuer's characters included "[[Goat Boy]]" (who hosted the fictional MTV program "Hey, Remember the 80s?") and Glen Henderson, the elder brother to [[Chris Kattan]]'s Todd Henderson/Azrael Abyss character in the "[[Goth Talk]]" skits. He has previously guest starred in ''[[Home Improvement (TV series)|Home Improvement]]''. That appearance gave way to the short-lived sitcom ''[[Buddies (TV series)|Buddies]]''. He was originally scheduled to have been the co-star alongside friend and co-worker [[Dave Chappelle]], but was pulled from the role after filming the pilot.

Among his impersonations was that of actor [[Joe Pesci]], who hosted his own talk show, often accompanied by [[Colin Quinn]] playing fellow actor [[Robert De Niro]]. In a 1997 episode of ''SNL'', both Pesci and De Niro made surprise appearances to "confront" Breuer.

In 1998, Breuer hosted "The Jim Breuer Show" on MTV which aired week days at 5:30 PM and again at 1:00 AM during the summer. It included Breuer performing skits as different characters as well as stand-up comedy by guests including [[Judah Friedlander]], [[Jeff Ross]] and [[Tracy Morgan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0165034/|title=The Jim Breuer Show (1998– )|publisher=IMDb.com|accessdate=2014-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Breuer has also hosted several "Premium Blends" on [[Comedy Central]] as well as several appearances on other comedy shows.

Breuer hosted the third season of the [[VH1]] show ''[[Web Junk 20]]''. The season began on November 17, 2006. He replaced [[Patrice O'Neal]], who hosted the first two seasons of the show.

In 2002, Breuer's first one-hour Comedy Central special, "Hardcore," premiered. The same year, he released a comedy album titled ''Smoke 'n' Breu''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael Cusanelli |url=http://allmusic.com/album/smoke-n-breu-r608281 |title=Smoke 'n' Breu - Jim Breuer &amp;#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2014-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 25, 2009, Breuer's second one-hour Comedy Central special, "Let's Clear the Air," premiered and came in as one of the highest rated comedy specials in Comedy Central's history. {{citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Breuer appeared in [[Pizza Hut]] commercials, advertising the cheese crust-filled pizzas using the catch phrase "Jackpot!"

Also, Breuer starred in the VH1 documentary ''[[When Ruled the World|When Metallica Ruled the World]]'' where he commented on the songs by Metallica through the years.

Beginning in 2016, Breuer has appeared in the recurring role of Father Philip on the CBS sitcom ''[[Kevin Can Wait]]'', which is set and filmed in Breuer's native [[Nassau County, New York]].

===Radio career===
Breuer was a sit-in comedian on the ''[[Opie and Anthony Show]]'' for many years during their [[WNEW-FM]] tenure. "Breuer Bits" were often played whenever the show was on hiatus.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} With the [[XM/Sirius merger]] complete, Breuer returned to the ''Opie and Anthony Show'' for the first time in six years on August 8, 2008.&lt;ref name=OANDAAUG8TH2008&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.923krock.com/pages/1420414.php#fri |title=Opie and Anthony Show Rundown for August 8th, 2008|publisher=923krock.com|accessdate=2014-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; He remained a frequent guest.

Breuer is the host of ''Fridays with Jim Breuer,'' (previously known as ''Breuer Unleashed'') which can be heard each Friday afternoon from 4-6PM (EST) on the [[Sirius Satellite Radio]] channel "Raw Dog Comedy." He credits [[Joe Pesci]] with jump starting his career as he mentions in his comedy concert "Hardcore". During one show, while Breuer was singing the [[Judas Priest]] song "Devil's Child," [[Rob Halford]], lead singer of Judas Priest, entered the studio and joined Breuer in song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2bRzhkGNJI |title=Breuer and Halford Duet |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2014-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other work===
In 2008, Breuer went on his first tour in six years known as the "Breuniversity Tour" where he toured over 20 colleges and comedy clubs across the country.  The footage was used in his documentary ''More Than Me'', as well as his 4-hour DVD ''The Jim Breuer Road Journals,'' both of which were released in 2010.

On October 5, 2010 he published a book called ''I'm Not High (But I've Got a Lot of Crazy Stories about Life as a Goat Boy, a Dad, and a Spiritual Warrior)''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Breuer | first1 = Jim | title = I'm Not High: (But I've Got a Lot of Crazy Stories about Life as a Goat Boy, a Dad, and a Spiritual Warrior) | date = October 5, 2010 | publisher = Gotham Books | location = New York | isbn = 978-1-59240-575-6  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2011, he launched a podcast called "The Podcast Masters" with fellow comedian [[Pete Correale]].

In December 2011, Breuer presented at [[Metallica]]'s 30th Anniversary shows.

==Personal life==
He now lives in [[Chester Township, New Jersey]] with his wife, Dee, and three daughters.&lt;ref name=NYT2005&gt;{{cite web |author=Keller, Joel |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9500E7D8173FF935A25753C1A9639C8B63
