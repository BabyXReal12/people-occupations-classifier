'''Richard''' "'''Red'''" '''Skelton''' (July 18, 1913{{spaced ndash}}September 17, 1997) was an American [[comedian|comedy entertainer]]. He was best known for his national [[old-time radio|radio]] and television acts between 1937 and 1971, and as host of the television program ''[[The Red Skelton Show]]''. He has stars on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] for his work in radio and television, and also appeared in burlesque, [[vaudeville]], films, nightclubs, and casinos, all while he pursued an entirely separate career as an artist.

Skelton began developing his comedic and pantomime skills from the age of 10, when he became part of a traveling [[medicine show]]. He then spent time on a [[showboat]], worked the [[burlesque]] circuit, and then entered into vaudeville in 1934. The "Doughnut Dunkers" [[pantomime]] sketch, which he wrote together with his wife, launched a career for him in vaudeville, radio, and films. His radio career began in 1937 with a guest appearance on ''[[The Fleischmann's Yeast Hour]]'', which led to his becoming the host of ''[[Avalon Time]]'' in 1938. He became the host of ''[[The Raleigh Cigarette Program]]'' in 1941, on which many of his comedy characters were created, and he had a regularly scheduled radio program until 1957. Skelton made his film debut in 1938 alongside [[Ginger Rogers]] and [[Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.]] in [[Alfred Santell]]'s ''[[Having Wonderful Time]]'', and he went on to appear in numerous musical and comedy films throughout the 1940s and early 1950s, with starring roles in ''[[Ship Ahoy]]'' (1941), ''[[I Dood It]]'' (1943), ''[[Ziegfeld Follies (film)|Ziegfeld Follies]]'' (1946), and ''[[The Clown (1953 film)|The Clown]]'' (1953).

Skelton was most eager to work in television, even when the medium was in its infancy. ''The Red Skelton Show'' made its television premiere on September 30, 1951, on [[NBC]]. By 1954, Skelton's program moved to [[CBS]], where it was expanded to one hour and renamed ''The Red Skelton Hour'' in 1962. Despite high ratings, the show was cancelled by CBS in 1970, as the network believed that more youth-oriented programs were needed to attract younger viewers and their spending power. Skelton moved his program to NBC, where he completed his last year with a regularly scheduled television show in 1971. He spent his time after that making as many as 125 personal appearances a year and working on his art.

Skelton's artwork of clowns remained a hobby until 1964 when his wife Georgia persuaded him to have a showing at the [[Sands Hotel and Casino|Sands Hotel]] in [[Las Vegas]] while he was performing there. Sales of his originals were successful, and he also sold prints and lithographs of them, earning $2.5 million yearly on lithograph sales. At the time of his death, his art dealer believed that Skelton had earned more money through his paintings than from his television work.

Skelton believed that his life's work was to make people laugh; he wanted to be known as a clown because he defined it as being able to do everything. He had a 70-year career as a performer and entertained three generations of Americans. His widow donated many of his personal and professional effects to [[Vincennes University]], including prints of his artwork. They are part of the Red Skelton Museum of American Comedy at Vincennes.

==Biography==

===Early years, the medicine show and the circus (1913–1929)===
Born Richard Bernard Eheart{{sfn|Hyatt|2004|p=6}} on July 18, 1913, in [[Vincennes, Indiana]], Skelton was the fourth and youngest son of Ida Mae (née Fields) and Joseph Elmer Skelton. Joseph, a grocer, died two months before Richard was born; he had once been a [[clown]] with the [[Hagenbeck-Wallace Circus]].&lt;ref name=NYTObit&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/18/arts/red-skelton-knockabout-comic-and-clown-prince-of-the-airwaves-is-dead-at-84.html?src=pm |title=Red Skelton, Knockabout Comic and Clown Prince of the Airwaves, Is Dead at 84 |author=Severo, Richard |date=September 18, 1997 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=May 18, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130210010127/http://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/18/arts/red-skelton-knockabout-comic-and-clown-prince-of-the-airwaves-is-dead-at-84.html?src=pm |archivedate=February 10, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Obit&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=F_RLAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=2u0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6805,971926&amp;dq=red+skelton&amp;hl=en|title=Lovable Clown Red Skelton Dies|date=September 18, 1997|page=A9|work=The Deseret News|accessdate=May 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His birth certificate surname was that of his father's stepfather. During Skelton's lifetime there was some dispute about the year of his birth. Author Wesley Hyatt suggests that since he began working at such an early age, Skelton may have claimed he was older than he actually was in order to gain employment.{{sfn|Hyatt|2004|p=6}}{{efn|Skelton's birth certificate lists him as Richard Bernard Eheart. The Eheart surname comes from Joseph's stepfather, and it appears that Joseph also used his stepfather's surname at times.{{sfn|Hyatt|2004|p=6}} In a 1983 appearance on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'', Skelton said his middle name was really "Red" and he had made up the middle name Bernard to satisfy a schoolteacher who would not believe his middle name was really "Red", although this story he presented in the comedy interview appearance does not match the reported content of his birth certificate. There is also an account of Skelton's using the birth certificate of one of his older brothers as proof that he was legally of age.&lt;ref name=LAobit/&gt;}}{{efn|Hyatt also refers to a ''People'' magazine story published in 1980, where Skelton said he was in his seventies.&lt;ref name=People/&gt;}} Vincennes neighbors described the Skelton family as being extremely poor; a childhood friend remembered that her parents broke up a youthful romance between her sister and Skelton because they thought he had no future.&lt;ref name=Carl/&gt;

Because of the loss of his father, Skelton went to work as early as the age of seven, selling newspapers and doing other odd jobs to help his family, who had lost the family store and their home.&lt;ref name=Carl/&gt;&lt;ref name=legend&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1433&amp;dat=20070719&amp;id=YbA8AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=mBMGAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2663,2567274|title=Red Skelton: An American Legend|date=July 19, 2007|author=Miller, Russ|work=The Goldendale Sentinel|page=2|accessdate=April 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He quickly learned the [[Newspaper delivery|newsboy's]] patter and would keep it up until a prospective buyer bought a copy of the paper just to quiet him.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt; According to later accounts, Skelton's early interest in becoming an entertainer stemmed from an incident that took place in Vincennes around 1923, when a stranger, supposedly the comedian [[Ed Wynn]], approached Skelton, who was the newsboy selling papers outside a Vincennes theater. When the man asked Skelton what events were going on in town, Skelton suggested he see the new show in town. The man purchased every paper Skelton had, providing enough money for the boy to purchase a ticket for himself. The stranger turned out to be one of the show's stars, who later took the boy backstage to introduce him to the other performers. The experience prompted Skelton, who had already shown comedic tendencies, to pursue a career as a performer.{{sfn|Gehring|2008|p=22}}&lt;ref name=Obit/&gt;&lt;ref name=Carl/&gt;{{efn|Skelton also told another version of this actor and young newsboy story, with [[Raymond Hitchcock (actor)|Raymond Hitchcock]] as the actor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=PFobAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=-kwEAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=red-skelton%20raymond-hitchcock&amp;pg=1520%2C5274344|title=I Dare Say!|author=Parry, Florence Fisher|date=September 14, 1946|work= The Pittsburgh Press|page=2|accessdate=June 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Skelton discovered at an early age that he could make people laugh. Skelton dropped out of school around 1926 or 1927, when he was 13 or 14 years old, but he already had some experience performing in [[Minstrel shows|minstrel]] shows in Vincennes, and on a [[showboat]], ''The Cotton Blossom'', that plied the [[Ohio River|Ohio]] and [[Missouri River|Missouri]] rivers.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;{{sfn|Gehring|2008|p=26}} He enjoyed his work on the riverboat, moving on only after he realized that showboat entertainment was coming to an end.&lt;ref name=LAobit&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997/sep/18/news/mn-33654 |title=Red Skelton, TV and Film's Quintessential Clown, Dies |work=Los Angeles Times |date=September 18, 1997 |accessdate=March 27, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220063712/http://articles.latimes.com/1997/sep/18/news/mn-33654 |archivedate=December 20, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Skelton, who was interested in all forms of acting, took a dramatic role with the John Lawrence [[Summer stock theatre|stock theater]] company, but was unable to deliver his lines in a serious manner; the audience laughed instead. In another incident, while performing in ''[[Tom Shows|Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'', Skelton was on an unseen treadmill; when it malfunctioned and began working in reverse, the frightened young actor called out, "Help! I'm backing into heaven!" He was fired before completing a week's work in the role.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;&lt;ref name=LAobit/&gt;&lt;ref name=goof/&gt; At the age of 15, Skelton did some early work on the [[American burlesque|burlesque]] circuit,{{sfn|Pendergast|1999|p=388}} and reportedly spent four months with the Hagenbeck-Wallace Circus in 1929, when he was 16 years old.&lt;ref name=Clown&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=VNBTAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=sDgNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4431,1071471&amp;dq=red+skelton&amp;hl=en|title=Red Skelton just wants to be a clown|date=November 9, 1966|work=Lawrence Journal-World|page=18|accessdate=May 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ida Skelton, who held multiple jobs to support her family after the death of her husband, did not suggest that her youngest son had run away from home to become an entertainer, but "his destiny had caught up with him at an early age". She let him go with her blessing. Times were tough during the [[Great Depression]], and it may have meant one less child for her to feed.&lt;ref name=Obit/&gt;{{sfn|Gehring|2008|p=8}} Around 1929, while Skelton was still a teen, he joined "Doc" R.E. Lewis's traveling [[medicine show]] as an errand boy who sold bottles of medicine to the audience. During one show, when Skelton accidentally fell from the stage, breaking several bottles of medicine as he fell, people laughed. Both Lewis and Skelton realized one could earn a living with this ability and the fall was worked into the show. He also told jokes and sang in the medicine show during his four years there.{{sfn|Gehring|2008|pp=44–45}} Skelton earned ten dollars a week, and sent all of it home to his mother. When she worried that he was keeping nothing for his own needs, Skelton reassured her: "We get plenty to eat, and we sleep in the wagon."&lt;ref name=saga&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/ra00mac#page/n435/mode/2up |title=The Skelton Saga |author=Swanson, Pauline |work=Radio-TV Mirror |date=April 1949 |pages=56–60, 93–99 |accessdate=March 25, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131108005234/http://archive.org/stream/ra00mac |archivedate=November 8, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Burlesque to vaudeville (1929–1937)===
[[File:Red and Edna Skelton at home 1942.jpg|thumb|alt=Skelton and Edna at home, 1942|Red and Edna Skelton at home, 1942]]
As burlesque comedy material became progressively more [[Ribaldry#Blue comedy|ribald]], Skelton moved on.  He insisted that he was no prude; "I just didn't think the lines were funny". He became a sought-after [[master of ceremonies]] for [[dance marathon]]s (known as "walkathons" at the time), a popular fad in the 1930s.&lt;ref name=LAobit/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2519&amp;dat=19710513&amp;id=BWpeAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=T2ENAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2140,1818674|title=Red Skelton Remembered as Area Performer Years Ago|date=May 13, 1971|work=Observer-Reporter|page=D3|accessdate=May 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The winner of one of the marathons was Edna Stillwell, an [[Usher (occupation)|usher]] at the old Pantages Theater.&lt;ref name=Edna2&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=wiZHAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=1noMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2058,6554331&amp;dq=red+skelton&amp;hl=en|title=Red Skelton's Wife Seeks Divorce: Continues to Write His Gags|date=December 30, 1942|work=Warsaw Daily Union|page=3|accessdate=May 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/13825793/edna_skelton_pound_obit/|title=Red Skelton's Former Wife, Edna, Dies|date=November 19, 1982|work=Los Angeles Times|page=1|accessdate=May 19, 2011|first=Tom|last=Brozini|via = [[Newspapers.com]]}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Edna Stillwell had two marriages following her divorce from Skelton, first to director [[Frank Borzage]] and then to Leon George Pound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Edna Skelton Pound Dies|date=May 19, 1982|work=The Modesto Bee}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=oWIbAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=wEwEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4856,2457817&amp;dq=red+skelton&amp;hl=en|title=Skelton's Ex-Wife Married to Director|date=November 26, 1945|work=The Pittsburgh Press|page=15|accessdate=May 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/VPJL-P8S|title=California Death Index 1940–1997|publisher=FamilySearch.org|accessdate=March 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} She approached Skelton after winning the contest and told him that she did not like his jokes; he asked if she could do better.&lt;ref name=bum&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=33RFAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ibwMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5491,2851007&amp;dq=red+skelton&amp;hl=en|title=If It Weren't For His Wife Edna, He Would Be a Bum-Says Red Skelton|author=Othman, Frederick C.|date=August 17, 1941|work=The Telegraph Herald|page=13|accessdate=May 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They married in 1931 in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], and Edna began writing his material. At the time of their marriage Skelton was one month away from his 18th birthday; Edna was 16.&lt;ref name=LAobit/&gt;{{sfn|Hyatt|2004|p=7}}  When they learned that Skelton's salary was to be cut, Edna went to see the boss; he resented the interference, until she came away with not only a raise, but additional considerations as well. Since he had left school at an early age, his wife bought [[textbook]]s and taught him what he had missed. With Edna's help, Skelton received a [[General Educational Development|high school equivalency degree]].&lt;ref name=bum/&gt;{{efn|Skelton became a well-read man with a fine memory which he began training in his youth.&lt;ref name=talents&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=RnxPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ZQUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5335%2C3497517|title=Making Audiences Laugh Is Just One Of His Talents|author=Beck, Marilyn|date=September 21, 1969|work=Ocala Star-Banner|pages=8, 22|accessdate=May 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The couple put together an act and began booking it at small midwestern theaters.&lt;ref name=Franchey/&gt; When an offer came for an engagement in [[Harwich Port, Massachusetts]], some 2,000 miles from Kansas City, they were pleased to get it because of its proximity to their ultimate goal, the vaudeville houses of New York City.  To get to Massachusetts they bought a used car and borrowed five dollars from Edna's mother, but by the time they arrived in St. Louis they had only fifty cents.  Skelton asked Edna to collect empty cigarette packs; she thought he was joking, but did as he asked.  He then spent their fifty cents on bars of soap, which they cut into small cubes and wrapped with the tinfoil from the cigarette packs.  By selling their products for fifty cents each as fog remover for eyeglasses, the Skeltons were able to afford a hotel room every night as they worked their way to Harwich Port.&lt;ref name=saga/&gt;

===="Doughnut Dunkers"====
[[File:Red Skelton and John Garfield at FDR Birthday Ball 1944.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Skelton and John Garfield at FDR Birthday Ball, 1944|Skelton with [[John Garfield]] at the 1944 FDR Birthday Ball]]
Skelton and Edna worked for a year in [[Camden, New Jersey]], and were able to get an engagement at [[Montreal]]'s Lido Club in 1934 through a friend who managed the chorus lines at New York's [[Roxy Theatre (New York City)|Roxy Theatre]].&lt;ref name=saga/&gt; Despite an initial rocky start, the act was a success, and brought them more theater dates throughout Canada.&lt;ref name=LAobit/&gt;{{efn|Since much of Skelton's success had been in Canada at this point, many reviewers believed he was Canadian, calling him "a Canadian lad".{{sfn|Gehring|2008|p=66}}}}

Skelton's performances in Canada led to new opportunities and the inspiration for a new, innovative routine that brought him recognition in the years to come. While performing in Montreal, the Skeltons met Harry Anger, a  vaudeville producer for New York City's [[Loew's State Theatre (New York City)|Loew's State Theatre]]. Anger promised the pair a booking as a headlining act at Loew's, but they would need to come up with new material for the engagement. While the Skeltons were having breakfast in a Montreal diner, Edna had an idea for a new routine as she and Skelton observed the other patrons eating [[doughnut]]s and drinking coffee. They devised the "Doughnut Dunkers" routine, with Skelton's visual impressions of how different people ate [[doughnut]]s.{{efn|Skelton copyrighted the original "Doughnut Dunkers" routine and every possible variation of it.&lt;ref name=millionaire/&gt;}}  The skit won them the Loew's State engagement and a handsome fee.&lt;ref name=Franchey/&gt;{{sfn|Adir|2001|p=197}}

The couple viewed the Loew's State engagement in 1937 as Skelton's big chance. They hired New York comedy writers to prepare material for the engagement, believing they needed more sophisticated jokes and skits than the routines Skelton normally performed. However, his New York audience did not laugh or applaud until Skelton abandoned the newly written material and began performing the "Doughnut Dunkers" and his older routines.&lt;ref name=LAobit/&gt;{{efn|The problem with doing the "Doughnut Dunkers" skit was that Skelton had to eat nine doughnuts at every performance. He was performing five times a day and eating 45 doughnuts. He gained nearly 35 pounds, and had to shelve the routine until he lost some weight.&lt;ref name=Franchey&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/radiotelevis00macf#page/8/mode/2up |title=Everything's Funny But Love |author=Franchey, John R. |work=Radio-Television Mirror |date=June 1942 |pages=8, 9, 46 |accessdate=March 25, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131108002947/http://archive.org/stream/radiotelevis00macf |archivedate=November 8, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Adir|2001|p=197}}}} The doughnut-dunking routine also helped Skelton rise to celebrity status. In 1937, while he was entertaining at the Capitol Theater in Washington, D.C., President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] invited Skelton to perform at a [[White House]] luncheon. During one of the official toasts, Skelton grabbed Roosevelt's glass, saying, "Careful what you drink, Mr. President.  I got rolled in a place like this once." His humor appealed to FDR and Skelton became the master of ceremonies for Roosevelt's official birthday celebration for many years afterward.&lt;ref name=laugh/&gt;

Skelton  appeared in numerous films for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer throughout the 1940s. In 1940 he provided [[comic relief]] as a lieutenant in [[Frank Borzage]]'s war drama ''[[Flight Command]]'', opposite [[Robert Taylor (actor)|Robert Taylor]], [[Ruth Hussey]] and [[Walter Pidgeon]].{{sfn|Hyatt|2004|p=10}} In 1941 he also provided comic relief in [[Harold S.

Skelton was soon starring in comedy features as inept radio detective "The Fox", the first of which was ''[[Whistling in the Dark (1941 film)|Whistling in the Dark]]'' (1941) in which he began working with director [[S.

In 1943, after a memorable role as a nightclub hatcheck attendant who becomes King [[Louis XV of France]] in a dream opposite [[Lucille Ball]] and [[Gene Kelly]] in [[Roy Del Ruth]]'s ''[[Du Barry Was a Lady]]'',{{sfn|Gehring|2008|p=154}}{{sfn|Langman|Gold|2001|p=286}} Skelton starred as Joseph Rivington Reynolds, a hotel valet besotted with Broadway starlet Constance Shaw (Powell) in [[Vincente Minnelli]]'s romantic musical comedy, ''[[I Dood It]]''. The film was largely a remake of [[Buster Keaton]]'s ''[[Spite Marriage]]''; Keaton, who had become a comedy consultant to MGM after his film career had diminished, began coaching Skelton on set during the filming. Keaton worked in this capacity on several of Skelton's films, and his 1926 film ''[[The General (1926 film)|The General]]'' was also later rewritten to become Skelton's ''[[A Southern Yankee]]'' (1948), under directors S.

Keaton offered to forgo his salary if the films made by the company were not box office hits; Mayer chose to decline the request.{{sfn|Adir|2001|pp=199-201}} In 1944, Skelton starred opposite [[Esther Williams]] in [[George Sidney]]'s musical comedy ''[[Bathing Beauty]]'', playing a songwriter with romantic difficulties. He next had a relatively minor role as a "TV announcer who, in the course of demonstrating a brand of gin, progresses from mild inebriation through messy drunkenness to full-blown stupor" in the "When Television Comes" segment of ''[[Ziegfeld Follies (film)|Ziegfeld Follies]]'', which featured [[William Powell]] and [[Judy Garland]] in the main roles.{{sfn|Affron|2009|p=138}} In 1946, Skelton played boastful clerk J.

The cost of answering his MGM fan mail was billed to Skelton. When Skelton agreed to make appearances approved by MGM, he did not receive the fee for his work; it went to MGM, who continued to pay him the contracted $2,000 per week.

Skelton's ability to successfully ad-lib often meant that the way the script was written was not always the way it was recorded on film.  Some directors were delighted with the creativity, but others were often frustrated by it.{{efn|Director Jack Donahue, who directed ''Watch the Birdie'', commented about Skelton's tendency to ad-lib, "God help us all.

Skelton was willing to negotiate with MGM to extend the agreement provided he would receive the right to pursue television.

===Radio, divorce and remarriage (1937–1951)===
Performing the "Doughnut Dunkers" routine led to Skelton's first appearance on [[Rudy Vallée]]'s ''[[The Fleischmann's Yeast Hour]]'' on August 12, 1937. Vallée's program had a talent show segment and those who were searching for stardom were eager to be heard on it. Vallée also booked veteran comic and fellow Indiana native [[Joe Cook (actor)|Joe Cook]] to appear as a guest with Skelton.  The two [[Hoosier]]s proceeded to trade jokes about their home towns, with Skelton contending to Cook, an [[Evansville, Indiana|Evansville]] native, that the city was a suburb of Vincennes.

Moose|Bullwinkle]]; there was enough similarity to cause Skelton to contemplate filing a lawsuit against Bill Scott, who voiced the cartoon moose.{{sfn|Hyatt|2004|p=11}} The second character, The Mean Widdle Kid, or "Junior", was a young boy full of mischief, who typically did things he was told not to do. "Junior" would say things like, "If I dood it, I gets a whipping.", followed moments later by the statement, "I dood it!"{{sfn|Hyatt|2004|p=11}} Skelton performed the character at home with Edna, giving him the nickname "Junior" long before it was heard by a radio audience.{{sfn|Adir|2001|p=199}} While the phrase was Skelton's, the idea of using the character on the radio show was Edna's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=TFIbAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=iEwEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1406,611914&amp;dq=richard+skelton&amp;hl=en|title=Skelton's Success Due Wife|author=Steinhauser, Si|date=March 5, 1942|work=The Pittsburgh Press|page=35|accessdate=May 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skelton starred in [[I Dood It|a 1943 movie of the same name]], but did not play "Junior" in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1946&amp;dat=19440122&amp;id=Fr8tAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=opgFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5957,3145003|title='Old Acquaintance' Drama Of Feminine Ways|date=January 22, 1944|work=The Montreal Gazette|page=9|accessdate=July 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase was such a part of national culture at the time that, when [[Jimmy Doolittle|General Doolittle]] conducted the [[Doolittle Raid|bombing of Tokyo]] in 1942, many newspapers used the phrase "Doolittle Dood It" as a headline.&lt;ref name=dood/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/?id=MAwEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PT115|title=Doolittle Dood It|author=Churvis, Mac|date=May 30, 1942|journal=Billboard|page=116 |accessdate=May 22, 2011|issn=0006-2510}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/?id=DlAEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA30e|title=Life on the Newsfronts of the World|date=June 1, 1942|journal=Life|page=30|accessdate=May 22, 2011|author1=Inc|first1=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a talk with President Roosevelt in 1943, Skelton used his radio show to collect funds for a [[Douglas A-20 Havoc]] to be given to the [[Soviet Army]] to help fight World War II. Asking children to send in their spare change, he raised enough money for the aircraft in two weeks; he named the bomber "We Dood It!"&lt;ref&gt;The original spelling was [http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/an-aeroplane-presented-to-the-red-air-force-by-red-skelton-news-photo/138586983 "We Doo'd it"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713064924/http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/an-aeroplane-presented-to-the-red-air-force-by-red-skelton-news-photo/138586983 |date=2015-07-13 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986 the Soviet newspaper ''[[Pravda]]'' offered praise to Skelton for his 1943 gift, and in 1993, the pilot of the plane was able to meet Skelton and thank him for the bomber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=h1BBAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=AakMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6915,4265444&amp;dq=red+skelton+dood&amp;hl=en|title=Red Skelton Wins Praise in Soviet Union|date=November 7, 1986|author=Shabad, Theodore|work=Harlan Daily Enterprise|page=3|accessdate=May 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bomberthanks&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=y-UiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=S7UFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4790,5948601&amp;dq=red+skelton+bomber&amp;hl=en|title=Pilot thanks Red Skelton for warplane|date=May 25, 1993|work=Beaver County Times|page=A2|accessdate=May 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|At their 1993 meeting, the former Soviet bomber pilot told Skelton he would have thanked him for the bomber some time ago, but a U.S. diplomat told him that Skelton was dead.&lt;ref name=bomberthanks/&gt;}}

Skelton also added a routine he had been performing since 1928. Originally called "Mellow Cigars", the skit entailed an announcer who became ill as he smoked his sponsor's product. Brown and Williamson, the makers of cigarettes, asked Skelton to change some aspects of the skit; he renamed the routine "Guzzler's Gin", where the announcer became inebriated while sampling and touting the imaginary sponsor's wares.&lt;ref name=Recluse&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ufhaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=jU0NAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6633,6965434&amp;dq=red+skelton+queen&amp;hl=en|title=Red Skelton Is No Recluse|date=April 17, 1984|work=The Mount Airy News|page=11A|accessdate=May 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the traditional radio program called for its cast to do an audience [[Warm-up comedian|warm-up]] in preparation for the broadcast, Skelton did just the opposite.  After the regular radio program had ended, the show's guests were treated to a post-program performance.  He would then perform his "Guzzler's Gin" or any of more than 350 routines for those who had come to the radio show.  He updated and revised his post-show routines as diligently as those for his radio program.  As a result, studio audience tickets for Skelton's radio show were in high demand; there were times where up to 300 people needed to be turned away for lack of seats.&lt;ref name=laugh/&gt;{{sfn|Dunning|1998|p=570}}

====Divorce from Edna, marriage to Georgia====
In 1942, Edna announced that she was leaving Skelton but would continue to manage his career and write material for him.

When the divorce was finalized, she went to New York, leaving her former husband three fully prepared show scripts. Skelton and those associated with him sent telegrams and called her, asking her to come back to him in a professional capacity.&lt;ref name=EdnaS&gt;{{cite news|title=Edna Skelton:Lasting Loyalty|author=Cosby, Vivian|work=The Milwaukee Journal|page=4|date=November 13, 1949}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Divorce Can't Part Edna and Red|author=Daniel, Jesse|work=The Milwaukee Journal|date=January 16, 1944|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The couple cared deeply for each other, but for reasons known best to them both, could have a successful professional relationship, but not a marriage.  Skelton can be seen in the film ''Whistling in the Dark'' dancing with one of his female co-stars with his fingers crossed.  In a 1942 interview, he explained the reason for this, saying he only loved Edna and when he did romantic film scenes, he always crossed his fingers to indicate that the screen emotion was not real.{{sfn|Gehring|2008|pp=134-135}} After his engagement to actress Muriel Morris ended, Skelton tried to persuade Edna to remarry him; he was not successful.&lt;ref name=EdnaS/&gt;}}  Edna remained the manager of the couple's funds because Skelton spent money too easily. An attempt at managing his own checking account that began with a $5,000 balance, ended five days later after a call to Edna saying the account was overdrawn. Skelton had a weekly allowance of $75, with Edna making investments for him, choosing real estate and other relatively stable assets.&lt;ref name=laugh&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/Colliers-1950apr15-00022 |title=Is He a Big Laugh! |editor-last=Shearer |editor-first=Lloyd |pages=22–23, 55 |date=April 15, 1950 |work=Collier's Weekly |accessdate=April 5, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429045927/http://www.unz.org/Pub/Colliers-1950apr15-00022 |archivedate=April 29, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She remained an advisor on his career until 1952, receiving a generous weekly salary for life for her efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=EXpWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=5-UDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5192,3087023&amp;dq=edna+skelton&amp;hl=en|title=Da Proboscis In Hot Demand|date=March 8, 1952|work=The Spokesman-Review|page=5|accessdate=May 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The divorce meant that Skelton had lost his married man's [[Conscription in the United States|deferment]]; he was once again classified as 1-A for service. He was drafted into the [[United States Army|army]] in early 1944; both MGM and his radio [[Sponsor (commercial)|sponsor]] tried to obtain a deferment for the comedian, but to no avail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=uhtiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=qnUNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5457,2096932&amp;dq=red+skelton&amp;hl=en|title=Consider Deferment For Film Comedian|date=May 17, 1944|work=The Telegraph-Herald|page=6|accessdate= May 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His last Raleigh radio show was on June 6, 1944, the day before he was formally inducted as a private; he was not assigned to [[Special Services (entertainment)|Special Services]] at that time.

By 1944, Skelton was engaged to actress Muriel Morris, who was also known as Muriel Chase; the couple had obtained a marriage license and told the press they intended to marry within a few days. At the last minute, the actress decided not to marry him, initially saying she intended to marry a wealthy businessman in Mexico City. She later recanted the story about marrying the businessman, but continued to say that her relationship with Skelton was over. The actress further denied that the reason for the breakup was Edna's continuing to manage her ex-husband's career; Edna stated that she had no intention of either getting in the middle of the relationship or reconciling with her former husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=vMheAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=WzIMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3537,461014&amp;dq=red+skelton&amp;hl=en|title=Red, Muriel Make Ready for Wedding|date=April 8, 1944|work=Lewiston Morning Tribune|page=5|accessdate=May 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=F2pIAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=CVUDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6525,5823272&amp;dq=red+skelton&amp;hl=en|title=Skelton Marriage Cancellation Real Mystery|date=April 11, 1944|work=The Evening Independent|page=1|accessdate=May 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Skelton served in the [[United States Army]] during [[World War II]].

The pressure of his workload caused him to suffer [[Fatigue (medical)|exhaustion]] and a [[Mental breakdown|nervous breakdown]].&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;&lt;ref name=release/&gt; His nervous collapse while in the army left him with a serious [[stuttering]] problem.  While recovering at an army hospital at [[Fort Pickett|Camp Pickett]], Virginia, he met a soldier who had been severely wounded and was not expected to survive.

Upon returning to radio, Skelton brought with him many new characters that were added to his repertoire: Bolivar Shagnasty, described as a "loudmouthed braggart"; Cauliflower McPugg, a boxer; Deadeye, a cowboy; Willie Lump-Lump, a fellow who drank too much; and San Fernando Red, a conman with political aspirations.{{sfn|Hyatt|2004|p=14}} By 1947, Skelton's musical conductor was [[David Rose (songwriter)|David Rose]], who would go on to television with him; he had worked with Rose during his time in the army and wanted Rose to join him on the radio show when it went back on the air.{{sfn|Hyatt|2004|pp=14-15}}

During the 1951–1952 season, the program was broadcast from a converted NBC radio studio.{{sfn|Marx|1979|p=163}} The first year of the television show was done live; this led to problems as there was not enough time for costume changes; Skelton was on camera for most of the half-hour, including the delivery of a commercial which was written into one of the show's skits.{{sfn|Gehring|2008|p=231}}&lt;ref name=NBC&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/red_NBC_No_Guest |title=Red Skelton Show live on NBC-TV |publisher=NBC Television |accessdate=March 28, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160317083832/https://archive.org/details/red_NBC_No_Guest |archivedate=March 17, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Comment There are no copyright notices on the kinescope or film; a copyright check for both original and renewal registrations located nothing the NBC television shows done in 1951 and 1952. Skelton begins the program by displaying the two Emmys he and the show received; this was in 1952.--&gt; In early 1952, Skelton had an idea for a television sketch about someone who had been drinking not being able to know which way is up.  The script was completed and he had the show's production crew build a set that was perpendicular to the stage, so it would give the illusion that someone was walking on walls.  The skit, starring his character Willie Lump-Lump, called for the character's wife to hire a carpenter to re-do the living room in an effort to teach her husband a lesson about his drinking.  When Willie wakes up there after a night of drinking, he realizes he is not lying on the floor but on the living room wall.  Willie's wife goes about the house normally, but to Willie, she appears to be walking on a wall.  Within an hour after the broadcast, the NBC switchboard had received 350 calls regarding the show, and Skelton had received more than 2,500 letters about the skit within a week of its airing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/Colliers-1952mar29-00026 |title=Helter Skelton |date=March 29, 1952 |work=Collier's |pages=26–27 |accessdate=March 5, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429044222/http://www.unz.org/Pub/Colliers-1952mar29-00026 |archivedate=April 29, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Skelton was delivering an intense performance live each week, and the strain showed in physical illness.

Skelton frequently employed the art of pantomime for his characters: a segment of his weekly program was called the "Silent Spot" and the sketch was performed in pantomime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/eotv/skeltonred.htm |title=Red Skelton |publisher=Museum of Broadcast Communications |accessdate=March 29, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407060639/http://www.museum.tv/eotv/skeltonred.htm |archivedate=April 7, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He attributed his use of pantomime and few props to his early days when he did not want to have a lot of luggage, so he crafted routines that used few of them.&lt;ref name=welcome&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1755&amp;dat=19780108&amp;id=1T41AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=bWcEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6679,3198999|title=Red Skelton Gets Warm Welcome During Visit|author=Huisking, Charlie|work=Sarasota Herald-Tribune|date=January 8, 1978|page=2B|accessdate=March 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He explained that the right hat was the key to his being able to get into character.&lt;ref name=NBC/&gt;{{sfn|Gehring|2008|pp=247-248}}

Skelton's season premiere for the 1960–1961 television season was a tribute to the United Nations. Six hundred people from the organization, including diplomats, were invited to be part of the audience for the show. The program was entirely done in pantomime, as UN representatives from 39 nations were in the studio audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=7xRPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=eU4DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4913,4104908&amp;dq=red+skelton&amp;hl=en|title=Red Skelton Laughs Way Thru Iron Curtain at Opening Show|author=Agnew, Bruce|date=September 28, 1960|work=Prescott Evening Courier|page=4|accessdate=May 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the sketches he performed for the UN was that of the old man watching the parade.

===Off the air and bitterness (1970–1983)===
As the 1970s began, the networks began a [[Rural purge|major campaign]] to discontinue long-running shows that they considered stale or lacking youth appeal.

Though Skelton had always done live engagements at Nevada hotels and appearances such as state fairs during his television show's hiatus, he focused his time and energy on live performances after he was no longer on the air, performing up to 125 dates a year.&lt;ref name=redblue/&gt; He often arrived days early for his engagement and would serve as his own promotion staff, making the rounds of the local shopping malls.&lt;ref name=academy/&gt;  Before the show, his audiences received a ballot listing about 100 of his many routines and were asked to tick off their favorites.

===Later years and death===
In 1974, Skelton's interest in film work was rekindled with the news that [[Neil Simon]]'s comedy ''[[The Sunshine Boys]]'' would become a movie; his last significant film appearance had been in ''Public Pigeon No. 1'' in 1956. He screen tested for the role of Willy Clark with [[Jack Benny]], who had been cast as Al Lewis.&lt;ref name=rejects&gt;{{cite news|title=Skelton Rejects Role He Craved|date=June 12, 1974|work=The Miami News|page=5B}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although Simon had planned to cast [[Jack Albertson]], who played Willy on Broadway, in the same role for the film, Skelton's screen test impressed him enough to change his mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1798&amp;dat=19740522&amp;id=j_geAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=NY0EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7050,2394719|title=Skelton, Benny Set For Film "Sunshine Boys"|date=May 22, 1974|author=Haber, Joyce|work=Sarasota Journal|page=6B|accessdate=May 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Skelton declined the part, however, reportedly due to an inadequate financial offer,&lt;ref name=rejects/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1798&amp;dat=19740823&amp;id=FxsfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=UY0EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6983,2167140|title=Skelton Says 'Sunshine Boys' Pay Insufficient|author=Haber, Joyce|date=August 23, 1974|work=Sarasota Journal|page=5B|accessdate=May 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Benny's final illness forced him to withdraw as well.

Skelton began producing artwork in 1943, but kept his works private for many years. He said he was inspired to try his hand at painting after visiting a large Chicago [[department store]] that had various paintings on display. Inquiring as to the price of one which Skelton described as "a bunch of blotches", he was told, "Ten thousand wouldn't buy that one." He told the clerk he was one of the ten thousand who would not buy the painting, instead buying his own art materials. His wife Georgia, a former art student, persuaded him to have his first public showing of his work in 1964 at the [[Sands Hotel and Casino|Sands Hotel]] in Las Vegas where he was performing at the time.{{sfn|Gehring|2008|pp=280-282}}&lt;ref name=Art&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=owwdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=AZcEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7263,4009494&amp;dq=red+skelton&amp;hl=en|title=Red Skelton's Paintings Exhibited At Las Vegas|author=Gavin, Mike|date=June 21, 1964|work=Park City Daily News|page=14|accessdate=May 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skelton believed painting was an asset to his comedy work, as it helped him to better visualize the imaginary props used in his pantomime routines.&lt;ref name=classic&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/13824523/skeltonhedda_hopper_1964/|accessdate=January 14, 2017|title=Old Readhead's Come a Long, Long Way|author=Hopper, Hedda|date=March 1, 1964|page=19|work=The Detroit Free Press|via = [[Newspapers.com]]}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Skelton's first major post-television recognition came in 1978, when the [[Golden Globe Award]]s named him as the recipient for their [[Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award|Cecil B.

==Legacy and tributes==
Skelton preferred to be described as a clown rather than a comic: "A comedian goes out and hits people right on.  A clown uses pathos.  He can be funny, then turn right around and reach people and touch them with what life is like."&lt;ref name=circusclown&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2002&amp;dat=19740730&amp;id=7AgvAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=wNoFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2778,3650439|title=Red Skelton Kicked Off His Career With Circus|date=July 30, 1974|work=Beaver County Times|page=B5|accessdate=May 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; "I just want to be known as a clown", he said, "because to me that's the height of my profession. It means you can do everything—sing, dance and above all, make people laugh."&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;&lt;ref name=fame&gt;{{cite news|url=http://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/red-skelton/ |title=Red Skelton-Hollywood Walk of Fame |work=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=May 29, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610072912/http://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/red-skelton/ |archivedate=June 10, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  His purpose in life, he believed, was to make people laugh.&lt;ref name=Life/&gt;

In ''Groucho and Me'', [[Groucho Marx]] called Skelton "the most unacclaimed clown in show business", and "the logical successor to [[Charlie Chaplin|[Charlie] Chaplin]]", largely because of his ability to play a multitude of characters with minimal use of dialogue and props. "With one prop, a soft battered hat", Groucho wrote, describing a performance he had witnessed, "he successfully converted himself into an idiot boy, a peevish old lady, a teetering-tottering drunk, an overstuffed clubwoman, a tramp, and any other character that seemed to suit his fancy. No grotesque make-up, no funny clothes, just Red." He added that Skelton also "plays a dramatic scene about as effectively as any of the dramatic actors."{{sfn|Gehring|2008|p=xv}}{{sfn|Marx|1959|pp=136-137}} In late 1965 ventriloquist [[Edgar Bergen]], reminiscing about the entertainment business, singled out Skelton for high praise. "It's all so very different today. The whole business of comedy has changed — from 15 minutes of quality to quantity. We had a lot of very funny people around, from [[Charley Chase]] to Charlie Chaplin and [[Laurel and Hardy]]. The last one of that breed is Red Skelton."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fultonhistory.com/Newpapers%20Disk2/Utica%20NY%20Daily%20Observer/Utica%20NY%20Observer%201965%20pdf/Utica%20NY%20Observer%201965%20a%20-%204266.PDF#xml=http://www.fultonhistory.com/dtSearch/dtisapi6.dll?cmd=getpdfhits&amp;u=ffffffff8bdbc9e4&amp;DocId=2183107&amp;Index=Z%3a%5cIndex%20U%2dF%2dP&amp;HitCount=6&amp;hits=18+19+28+29+327+328+&amp;SearchForm=C%3a%5cinetpub%5cwwwroot%5cFulton%5fNew%5fform%2ehtml&amp;.pdf|title=You Can Go Back to Allen's Alley Sunday Night|date=November 12, 1965|work=Utica Observer-Dispatch|page=11|accessdate=October 30, 2013}} ([[PDF]])&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harry Cohn]] of [[Columbia Pictures]] also praised Skelton, saying, "He's a clown in the old tradition.

In 2006, Travis Tarrants purchased the historic Vincennes [[Pantheon Theatre]], where Skelton performed during his youth. He established a non-profit organization with the hope of restoring the theatre to its 1921 state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Twitty |first=Tiffany |title=1921 Pantheon Theatre will be part of downtown Vincennes' future |url=http://www.indianaeconomicdigest.com/main.asp?Search=1&amp;ArticleID=27016&amp;SectionID=31&amp;SubSectionID=195&amp;S=1 |work=Indiana Economic Digest |publisher=IBRC and IAR |accessdate=6 May 2011 |date=18 May 2006 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320190745/http://www.indianaeconomicdigest.com/main.asp?Search=1&amp;ArticleID=27016&amp;SectionID=31&amp;SubSectionID=195&amp;S=1 |archivedate=20 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tarrants was able to raise close to $300,000 for the restoration. Two years later, donations for the project plummeted. Tarrants lost the theatre to unpaid back taxes in 2012 and the new owner was realtor Heath Klein.  In late 2014, Klein sold the theatre property to a Vincennes non-profit group, INVin.  The organization works to bring arts and arts-related businesses into downtown Vincennes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://indianaeconomicdigest.com/Main.asp?SectionID=31&amp;SubSectionID=121&amp;ArticleID=77658 |title=Another chance for Vincennes' Pantheon Theatre where Red Skelton first performed |author=McNeese, Jenny |date=December 24, 2014 |publisher=Vincennes Sun-Commercial |accessdate=November 28, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161231170333/http://indianaeconomicdigest.com/Main.asp?SectionID=31&amp;SubSectionID=121&amp;ArticleID=77658 |archivedate=December 31, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2016, the group proposed to turn the theatre into shared workspace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20160310/news/303109955/ |title=Group sees 1919 Vincennes theater becoming shared work space |date=March 10, 2016 |publisher=Vincennes Sun-Commercial |author=McNeese, Jenny |accessdate=November 28, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161231080940/http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20160310/news/303109955/ |archivedate=December 31, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
