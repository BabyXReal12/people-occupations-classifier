==Early life==
Robert Francis Goldthwait was born on May 26, 1962 in [[Syracuse, New York]], the son of Kathleen Ann (Welch), a department store employee, and Thomas Lincoln Goldthwait, a sheet metal worker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/77/Bob-Goldthwait.html|title=Bob Goldthwait Biography (1962-)|work=filmreference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/35957085/|date=April 25, 1948|newspaper=[[The Post-Standard]]|location=[[Syracuse, New York]]|page=34|title=Club Events and Weddings}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was raised in a [[Catholic]] working-class family.&lt;ref name="ref09"&gt;{{cite news|last=Champ|first=Christine|title=Interview: Bobcat Goldthwait on World's Greatest Dad, Time Machines, Woody Allen, and More|pages=|publisher=Film.com|date=August 19, 2009|url=http://www.film.com/celebrities/bobcat-goldthwait/story/interview-bobcat-goldthwait-worlds-greatest/29736269|accessdate=August 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At an early age, Goldthwait decided on a career as a comedian and was performing professionally while still in high school at age 15. He attended St. Matthew's grammar school in [[East Syracuse, New York]], where he met [[Tom Kenny]] in first grade.&lt;ref name="backstage"&gt;https://www.backstage.com/interview/tom-kenny-finds-his-voice-as-spongebob-squarepants/&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980, they graduated together from [[Bishop Grimes Junior/Senior High School]] in East Syracuse, New York.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} They formed a comedy troupe &lt;!-- with [[Tom Nettle]] --&gt; called The Generic Comics.&lt;ref name="backstage"/&gt; In their mid-teens, they saw an ad for an open-mic night in [[Skaneateles (town), New York|Skaneateles]] that featured comedian [[Barry Crimmins]] with the moniker "Bear Cat". He and Kenny went to the event and performed under the monikers Bobcat and Tomcat, respectively, as a tribute to Crimmins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/culture/sarah-larson/barry-crimminss-life-changing-comedy|title=Barry Crimmins’s Life-Changing Comedy|author=|date=|website=The New Yorker|accessdate=June 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.syracuse.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2016/10/barry_crimmins_comedy_special_louis_ck.html|title=Louis C.K. directs CNY comedy legend Barry Crimmins' first-ever standup special|author=|date=|website=syracuse.com|accessdate=June 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early in his career, Goldthwait also co-wrote with [[Martin Olson]], who is listed as writer on his first two comedy specials ''Share the Warmth'' and ''Don't Watch This Show''.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

==Career==

===Stand-up===
Goldthwait became recognized as a solo stand-up comedian and had a record "Meat Bob" and two televised concert specials in the 1980s: ''An Evening with Bobcat Goldthwait&amp;nbsp;– Share the Warmth'' and ''Bob Goldthwait&amp;nbsp;– Is He Like That All the Time?'' He became known for his unique brand of comedy, which combines elements of [[political satire]] and often bizarre or unsettling [[black comedy]].

Goldthwait filmed a half-hour HBO special in 1995, and another comedy album in 2003 ''[[I Don't Mean to Insult You, But You Look Like Bobcat Goldthwait]]'' and in 2004 his stand-up was featured in Comedy Central's animated series ''[[Shorties Watchin' Shorties]]''. Goldthwait announced his retirement from stand-up in 2005 and performed a "final" run in [[Las Vegas Valley|Vegas]] in September 2005;{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} he briefly resumed touring in early 2008 (from January through April); he performed again in 2009, doing stand-up in Winnipeg on April 3 and 4, and again in Omaha on August 28 and 29; he returned to Winnipeg for 4 shows on April 9 and 10, 2010. He released a one-hour stand-up special in 2011 "[[You Don't Look the Same Either]]".

During the fall of 1993, Goldthwait performed stand-up material as an opening act for [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] on what would be their final North American tour, angering audiences in [[Chicago]] after making a joke about [[Michael Jordan]]'s recently murdered father. He also appeared in a promo video for the band's album ''[[In Utero (album)|In Utero]]'' and once fooled an interviewer during a phone interview, impersonating [[Dave Grohl]]. At midnight on New Year's Eve 1993, Goldthwait rappelled nude from a catwalk of the stage at the Oakland Coliseum as Kurt Cobain led a countdown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=MCRA NIRVANA|title=Nirvana - [Full Show Remastered] Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum Arena, Oakland, CA 1993|date=October 27, 2016|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdGAGDX5yhc|accessdate=June 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acting===
Goldthwait and [[Robin Williams]] appeared on the same bill together, but not as a comedy team, using the names "Jack Cheese" and "Marty Fromage." Goldthwait used the name Jack Cheese when he appeared in ''[[Tapeheads]]''; when Williams made a cameo as Mime Jerry in Goldthwait's ''[[Shakes the Clown]]'', he was billed as Marty Fromage.

Goldthwait has appeared in several films. His first major role was [[List of Police Academy characters#Cadet/Off. Zed McGlunk|Zed]] in the [[Police Academy (film series)|'' Police Academy'' franchise]]. He starred in ''[[One Crazy Summer]]'', ''[[Burglar (film)|Burglar]]'', ''[[Scrooged]]'' and ''[[Hot to Trot]]''. In 1992, Goldthwait directed, wrote, and starred in ''Shakes the Clown''. He also made an appearance as a writer in ''[[Radioland Murders]]''.&lt;ref name=joke/&gt;

In 1985, Goldthwait appeared in [[Twisted Sister]]'s official video to "[[Leader of the Pack]]" and "[[Be Chrool to Your Scuel]]" from ''[[Come Out and Play (Twisted Sister album)|Come Out and Play]]''.&lt;ref name=imdb&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001281/ |title=Bobcat Goldthwait |date= |accessdate=January 2, 2015 |quote= |publisher=[[IMDB]] |location= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, Goldthwait appeared as a guest-co-host of the second episode of ''[[The Ben Stiller Show]]''.  He also appeared as a relative of [[List of characters in Married... with Children#Peggy Bundy|Peggy Bundy]] on the ''[[Married... with Children]]'' show where he and his wife dropped one of their numerous offspring on the Bundys.&lt;ref name="imdb.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0642324/combined |title=Married With Children: 'Magnificent Seven' |work=imdb.com |accessdate=March 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Guest appearances and controversy===
Goldthwait appeared on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'' in 1993, where he tossed furniture and ran around the set, then into the audience.

As a guest on one of the last episodes of ''[[The Arsenio Hall Show]]'' in April 1994, Goldthwait became demonstrably upset that the program was being cancelled. At the time it was widely believed that [[Paramount Studios]] had refused to renew Hall's contract because ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'' was now moving to [[CBS]], and Goldthwait took his anger out on Paramount. He stood on the set's couch, spray-painted "Paramount Sucks" on a glass wall, and threw video equipment around the studio. Hall was forced to try to restrain Goldthwait and security was called to the set.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1994-05-01/news/9405010123_1_goldthwait-arsenio-hall-show-comedian | title = Quirky Comedian Erupts On 'Arsenio Hall Show' | publisher = Orlando Sentinel | date = May 1, 1994 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 9, 1994, Goldthwait appeared on ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'', where he briefly lit the guest chair on fire.&lt;ref name="people.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20104764,00.html |title=Hollywood's Most Wanted! '94 |work=People Magazine |quote=December 26, 1994 Vol. 42 No. 26 |accessdate=March 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, he was fined $2,700 plus the cost of the chair ($698); he was also required to tape several public service announcements about [[fire safety]].&lt;ref name="people.com"/&gt; Despite banishment rumors Jay Leno invited Goldthwait to appear seven days later for a bit with Goldthwait buried up to his neck in dirt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Joe Rogan Experience #800 - Bobcat Goldthwait|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn5NjiE98tQ|location=@ 1 hour 52 minutes|accessdate=June 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These incidents were later the basis of the plot for his subsequent appearance on ''[[The Larry Sanders Show]]'' in August 1994, where the fictional talk show hires him in the hope of improving their ratings if he does another stunt. They also inspired a pseudo-fire safety PSA on ''MadTV''.

=== Later work ===

He was also in 4 episodes of ''[[Space Ghost Coast to Coast]]'': "Bobcat", "Surprise", "Anniversary" and an uncredited appearance in the episode "Kentucky Nightmare".

One of the most recognizable features of Goldthwait's performances is his voice. He has voiced characters on the television series ''[[Capitol Critters]]'' (1992), ''[[The Moxy Show]]'' (1995), ''[[Unhappily Ever After]]'' (1995–1999), ''[[The Tick (animated TV series)|The Tick]]'' (1995), ''[[Hercules (1997 film)|Hercules]]'', ''[[Hercules: The Animated Series]]'' (1998–1999), ''[[Lilo &amp; Stitch: The Series]]'' (2003–2006), and ''[[Buzz Lightyear of Star Command]]'' (2000). Goldthwait has also appeared as himself hosting the comedy quiz show ''[[Bobcat's Big Ass Show]]'' (1998).  Goldthwait was also a semi-regular guest in the later seasons of the [[Tom Bergeron]]-version of ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'' in 1998.&lt;ref name=imdb/&gt;

[[File:Bobcat Goldthwait at Festival de deauville 2012.jpg|thumb|left|Goldthwait at the Festival du Cinema Americain ([[Deauville]] 2012)]]
Goldthwait was a featured guest on the August 20, 2009, episode of [[Adam Carolla]]'s podcast. And on August 26, 2009 he returned to guest on ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'' with old friend Robin Williams during which he revealed a tattoo on his buttocks of an [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphized]] [[cymbal]] with a [[mustache]] and slanted eyes (a pun on the [[Culture of China#Language|Chinese symbol]] tattoo).

Goldthwait appeared in September 2010 on an episode of ''[[LA Ink]]'', where shop owner Kat Von D gave him a tattoo of a potato, impaled on a fork, on his upper right arm. Goldthwait chose the design to remind himself of where he came from and to tell close friends and family that he hasn't lost his sense of humor. He also displayed his older tattoo of a [[cymbal]] with a moustache on his buttocks.

Goldthwait appeared on the May 4, 2012 episode of ''[[Real Time with Bill Maher]]''.&lt;ref name=imdb/&gt; Goldthwait was a voice guest in Season 4 of ''[[Adventure Time]]''. He voices Ed in the episode "Web Weirdos".&lt;ref name=imdb/&gt; Goldthwait appeared on [[NPR]]'s ''[[Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me!]]'' on May 12, 2012 to talk about his movie ''God Bless America'' and play the game "Not My Job" (he won).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Comedian Bobcat Goldthwait Plays Not My Job |url=https://www.npr.org/2012/05/12/152508096/comedian-bobcat-goldthwait-plays-not-my-job |quote= |work=[[Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me!]] |date=May 11, 2012 |accessdate=January 2, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He then made his debut as one of the show's panelists on the July 14, 2012.

In 2012, he voiced a character known as Pop Fizz, an overexcited gremlin chemist with the ability to drink his potion and become a rampaging monster, for the hit video game series ''[[Skylanders]]'', starting with ''[[Skylanders: Giants]]''. He later reprised the role of Pop Fizz in the 2016 [[Netflix]] series ''[[Skylanders Academy]]''.

===Directing===
Goldthwait began directing ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'' in 2004.&lt;ref name=joke&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Dave Itzkoff]] |coauthors= |title=No Joke: Bobcat Goldthwait, Auteur |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/09/movies/09itzk.html |quote= |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date= August 7, 2009 |accessdate=January 2, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=imdb/&gt; While there, ratings for the show increased to over 2 million viewers per night, and jumped 50% with teens; however, in May 2006 Goldthwait left to pursue his film career. Goldthwait maintains contact with Kimmel and still directs for television and film.  He returned to directing segments for ''Jimmy Kimmel Live!'' in the summer of 2007.

====''Sleeping Dogs Lie''====
Goldthwait's third feature film ''[[Sleeping Dogs Lie (2006 film)|Sleeping Dogs Lie]]'' (originally titled ''Stay'') starring [[Melinda Page Hamilton]] was in the 2006 [[Sundance Film Festival]] and was part of the "Independent Dramatic Features" competition. ''Sleeping Dogs Lie'' is about a youthful, impulsive instance of oral sex performed on a dog which opens the door to a [[black comedy]] about the complexities of honesty. It was also nominated for the Grand Jury Prize in the "Dramatic Features" category. The film was bought by Roadside Attractions &amp; Samuel Goldwyn Films at the 2006 [[Sundance Film Festival]] for the North American rights to the film, and was released on October 20, 2006. [[Gaumont Film Company|Gaumont]] bought the international rights to the film. It was released on February 21, 2007 by Gaumont in France, and on March 16, 2007 in the UK.

It starred Robin Williams, [[Daryl Sabara]], and [[Alexie Gilmore]].  The web site for the 2009 Sundance Film Festival described it as a "lusciously perverse, and refreshingly original comedy that tackles love, loss, and our curious quest for infamy". [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''Chicago Sun-Times'' gave ''World's Greatest Dad'' 3 out of 4 stars, but commented that the material could have been even darker in its satire, and he questioned whether it was the director's intention.

====''God Bless America''====
''[[God Bless America (film)|God Bless America]]'' premiered at the 2011 [[Toronto International Film Festival]] and screened within [[Maryland Film Festival]] 2012.

====''Willow Creek''====

On July 20, 2013 ''[[Willow Creek (film)|Willow Creek]] ''had its international premier at the [[Fantasia Festival]] in Montreal. After the movie Goldthwait stayed for a question and answer session.
On October 22, 2013, Bobcat was in attendance at the Portland, Oregon Premier of ''Willow Creek''. The Historic Hollywood theater hosted the packed house event. Bobcat, along with Cliff Barackman, cast member of Animal Planet's ''Finding Bigfoot'', answered questions after the showing. Barackman was originally in ''Willow Creek'' but due to editing, his scenes were cut from the film.

====''Call Me Lucky''====
In 2015, Goldthwait premiered [[Call Me Lucky (film)|''Call Me Lucky'']], his documentary on the life and work of comedian/activist [[Barry Crimmins]], at the Sundance Film Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harvey|first1=Dennis|title=Sundance Film Review: ‘Call Me Lucky’|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/reviews/sundance-film-review-call-me-lucky-1201422008/|website=Variety.com|publisher=Variety|accessdate=February 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
