'''Robin Ince''' (born 20 February 1969) is an English comedian, actor and writer. He is best known for presenting the [[BBC]] radio show ''[[The Infinite Monkey Cage]]'' with physicist [[Brian Cox (physicist)|Brian Cox]].&lt;ref name="NSci2011"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21028165.800-robin-ince-who-needs-religion.html |title=Robin Ince: Who needs religion? |publisher=New Scientist |date=15 June 2011 |accessdate=16 June 2011 |author=Roger Highfield}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
[[File:Robin Ince 2013.jpg|thumb|Ince in 2013]]
Starting at York House prep' school at Redheath in Hertfordshire, from the age of thirteen, Ince was educated at [[Cheltenham College]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.teachsecondary.com/comment/view/what-i-learnt-at-school-robin-ince |title=What I learnt at school: Robin Ince |work=TeachSecondary.com |accessdate=11 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a boarding [[independent school]] for boys in the [[spa town]] of [[Cheltenham]] in [[Gloucestershire]], followed by [[Royal Holloway, University of London]], from which he graduated in English and Drama in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.royalholloway.ac.uk/alumni/ouralumni/notablealumni/english/robinince(1969-).aspx Royal Holloway Notable Alumni in English]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stand-up career==
In 1990, Ince first appeared at Greyfriars Kirkhouse at the Edinburgh Festival where [[Eddie Izzard]] was running a venue. At the time Ince was performing in a play called 'Shadow Walker' by [[Trevor Maynard]].&lt;ref&gt;Robin Ince in "Shadow Walker", reviewed in "The Stage" 23 August 1990&lt;/ref&gt; He had appeared at the Cafe Royale as part of the [[Edinburgh Fringe]] show 'Rubbernecker', alongside [[Stephen Merchant]], [[Jimmy Carr]] and [[Ricky Gervais]] in 2001.

As a close friend of Ricky Gervais, Ince opened as a support act for his ''Politics'' tour in 2004 and his ''[[Fame (comedy)|Fame]]'' tour in 2007. He also appears on the DVD and often appears in Ricky's video podcasts, mainly being bullied, annoyed and attacked by Gervais.

Throughout 2008, Ince had residency at the Dorchester Arts Centre trying out new material for his upcoming shows. In late 2008 he released a live stand up DVD entitled ''Robin Ince is as Dumb as You'', released by [[Go Faster Stripe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Robin Ince is as Dumb as You |url=http://www.gofasterstripe.com/cgi-bin/website.cgi?page=videofull&amp;id=5042}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then between January and April 2009, Ince performed his UK tour ''Bleeding Heart Liberal'', playing 51 dates. Towards the end of 2009 and into 2010, Ince toured his next show entitled ''Robin Ince vs. the Moral Majority''. In 2011 he started on the road again performing his 'Happiness Through Science' UK show which continued to add many additional dates and whose scheduled was extended into 2012.

in April 2015, Ince announced that he would soon give up stand-up. The main reason he gave was to spend more time with his son; also, he cited well founded self-doubt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ince |first1=Robin |title=Losing My Religion – on why I am giving up stand up |url=https://robinince.wordpress.com/2015/04/21/losing-my-religion-on-why-i-am-giving-up-stand-up/ |publisher=Robin Ince's blog |accessdate=21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he started a stand-up tour, Pragmatic Insanity, in September 2017.

In September 2016, Ince performed at the Keep Corbyn rally in Brighton in support of [[Jeremy Corbyn]]'s [[Jeremy Corbyn Labour Party leadership campaign, 2016|campaign]] in the [[Labour Party (UK) leadership election, 2016|Labour Party leadership election]].&lt;ref name="theargus"&gt;{{cite news |last=Vowles|first=Neil|url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/14722904.Comedians_back_Jeremy_Corbyn_for_major_Brighton_rally/|title=Comedians back Jeremy Corbyn for major Brighton rally|work= |location= |publisher=''[[The Argus (Brighton)|The Argus]]''|date=5 September 2016|accessdate=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Book Club==
In 2005, Ince began running the ''Book Club'' night at The Albany, London, where acts are encouraged to perform turns of new and experimental material. The club gets its name from Ince's attempts to read aloud from – and humorously criticise – various second-hand books which the audience and he have brought in for the occasion. The Book Club proved to be so successful that Ince took it on a full UK tour in 2006, the same year he won the ''[[Time Out (company)|Time Out]]'' Award for Outstanding Achievement in Comedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.timeout.com/london/comedy/features/2020.html |title=Robin Ince's Book Club |publisher=Timeout.com |date=22 September 2006 |accessdate=22 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Ince published a book entitled Robin Ince's Bad Book Club about his favourite books that he has used for his shows.

==Television==
Ince started his career as a comedy writer, working on ''[[The 11 O'Clock Show]]'', for which he also performed as an [[Impressionist (entertainment)|impressionist]], including an impersonation of [[John Peel]]. He also appeared in ''[[The Office (UK TV series)|The Office]]'' as failed interviewee Stuart Foot. Ince has also appeared on clip shows on British television, where he and other comedians appeared as talking heads.

==Radio==
Ince and physicist [[Brian Cox (physicist)|Brian Cox]] present the science series ''[[The Infinite Monkey Cage]]'' on [[BBC Radio 4]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/comedy/8480326/Robin-Ince-The-science-of-comedy.html |title=Robin Ince: The science of comedy |date=1 May 2011 |accessdate=9 May 2011 |author=Manjit Kumar |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The programme won a Gold Award in the Best Speech Programme category at the 2011 [[Sony Radio Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/news/story/00000536/frank_skinner_jason_byrne_sonys_2011/ |title=Frank Skinner and Jason Byrne win at Sony Awards 2011 |publisher=The British Comedy Guide |date=9 May 2011 |accessdate=9 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.expressandstar.com/entertainment/showbiz-news/2011/05/09/tv-scientist-scoops-top-radio-award/ |title=TV scientist scoops top radio award |work=Express &amp; Star |date=9 May 2011 |accessdate=9 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is a regular contributor on [[Steve Lamacq]]'s [[BBC Radio 6 Music]] programme, appearing weekly as the show's "music profiler".

==Podcast==
Ince presented the ''Utter Shambles'' (previously ''Show &amp; Tell'') [[podcast]] for Paramount Comedy with [[Josie Long]], and presented [[BBC Radio 4 Extra]]'s ''[[Serious About Comedy]]'' from 2005 until its end in November 2007. Regular panellists in the show included ''Book Club'' performers [[Josie Long]], [[Howard Read]] and [[Natalie Haynes]], comedy critics Bruce Dessau and Stephen Armstrong, and many others from the British comedy industry. He now presents ''Book Shambles with Robin and Josie'' with Josie Long which is funded via [[Patreon]] and music podcast ''Vitriola'' with comedian [[Michael Legge (comedian)|Michael Legge]].

==Online==
In 2013, Ince co-created and launched The Incomplete Map of the Cosmic Genome, an online video based science magazine and archive.  Ince acts as host and co-producer on the project.  Contributors have included [[Brian Cox (physicist)|Brian Cox]], [[Helen Czerski]], [[Stephen Fry]], [[Chris Hadfield]] and [[Stewart Lee]].

==Personal life==
Ince is an [[atheist]] and supports the [[Rationalist Association]] via ''[[New Humanist]]'' magazine by organising events at the [[Bloomsbury Theatre]] and at the [[Hammersmith Apollo]] featuring scientists, musicians and comedians. The first of these was ''Nine Lessons and Carols for Godless People'' in Christmas 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/comics/r/179/robin_ince/review?id_review=1814 |last=Bennett |first=Steve |publisher=Chortle |title=The Return of Nine Lessons And Carols For Godless People |date=16 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more recently he has fronted a ''Night of 400 Billion Stars''. Regular contributions come from [[Josie Long]], [[Chris Addison]], [[Ricky Gervais]], [[Richard Dawkins]], [[Simon Singh]] and [[Philip Jeays]]. In 2009, Ince organised two events with Josie Long, called ''Darwin's Birthday Spectacular'', marking both the scientist's 200th birthday and the 150th anniversary of the publication of ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'''. He was made a Distinguished Supporter of [[Humanists UK]].
