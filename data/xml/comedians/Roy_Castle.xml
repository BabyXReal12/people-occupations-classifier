'''Roy Castle''', [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] (31 August 1932&lt;ref&gt;GRO Register of Births: DEC 1932 9a 303 HUDDERSFIELD – Roy Castle, mmn = Swallow&lt;/ref&gt; – 2 September 1994&lt;ref&gt;GRO Register of Deaths: "SEP 1994 B13A 237 CHILTERN &amp; SOUTH BUCKS – Roy Castle, DoB = 31 Aug 1932" aged 62&lt;/ref&gt;) was an English dancer, singer, comedian, actor, television presenter and musician. In addition to being an accomplished [[jazz]] trumpet player, he could play many other instruments. Following a versatile career as a performer on stage, television and film, he became best known to British television viewers as the long-running presenter of the children's series ''[[Record Breakers]]''.

==Early career==
Castle was born in [[Scholes, Holme Valley|Scholes]], near [[Holmfirth]], [[West Riding of Yorkshire]]. The son of a railwayman, he was a [[tap dancer]] from an early age and trained at Nora Bray's school of dance with Audrey Spencer who later turned out to have a big dance school,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.examiner.co.uk/news/local-west-yorkshire-news/2011/08/06/appeal-launched-for-memories-of-nora-bray-s-dance-school-86081-29187030/ | title = Appeal launched for memories of Nora Bray's dance school}}&lt;/ref&gt; and after leaving Holme Valley Grammar School (now [[Honley High School]]) he started his career as an entertainer in an amateur concert party. As a young performer in the 1950s, he lived in [[Cleveleys]] near [[Blackpool]] and appeared there at the local Queen's Theatre, turning professional in 1953 as a stooge for [[Jimmy Clitheroe]] and [[Jimmy James (comedian)|Jimmy James]]. By 1958 he was appearing at the [[Royal Variety Show]]. As a singer, he released one charting single in 1960, the Christmas song "Little White Berry".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theofficialcharts.com/artist/_/roy%20castle/ |title=ROY CASTLE &amp;#124; Artist &amp;#124; Official Charts |date=22 December 1960 |work=UK Chart Archive |publisher=[[Official Charts Company]] |accessdate=21 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Television and film career==
In 1965, Castle starred with [[Peter Cushing]] in the film ''[[Dr. Who and the Daleks]]'', the first of two cinematic spin-offs from the popular [[BBC]] television series. He played the role of [[Dr. Who (Dalek films)|Dr. Who]]'s first male assistant, [[List of companions in Doctor Who spin-offs#Ian Chesterton|Ian Chesterton]], and was cast to perform the role more comedically than it had been played by [[William Russell (actor)|William Russell]] in the original series. He also appeared in ''[[Dr. Terror's House of Horrors]]'' as a jazz musician suffering a curse after copying [[Haitian Vodou|voodoo]] tunes. He also appeared in ''[[Carry On Up the Khyber]]'' in 1968, and in the [[Musical film|TV musical]] ''[[Pickwick (1969 film)|Pickwick]]'' for the BBC in 1969. In the 90s he appeared again in Pickwick, touring the country, starring alongside Harry Secombe and the show was recorded again, which show Sir Harry had originally starred in the West End in 1963.  In 1973, Castle teamed up with the actor and comedian [[Ronnie Barker]] in the original one-off called "Another Fine Mess" (an episode from a series called ''[[Seven of One]]''). Barker was one of Castle's best friends, and paid tribute to their work together shortly after Castle's death.

Between 1967 and 1968 Castle co-starred with [[Jimmy Edwards]] in the London West End run of the comedy farce show ''[[Big Bad Mouse]]'' when [[Eric Sykes]] had to withdraw because of illness. The show was resident at the [[Shaftesbury Theatre]] and, being loosely scripted, it offered both Edwards and Castle the chance to freely [[Ad lib|ad-lib]] and generally break the [[fourth wall]] with the audience, Castle breaking into trumpet performances while Edwards walked into a front stall seat to read a newspaper, tap dancing and firing [[Table tennis|ping-pong]] balls into the stalls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bravoencore.co.uk/bravo.html Big Bad Mouse programme cover]&lt;/ref&gt; He also once stood in for [[Bruce Forsyth]] hosting ''[[The Generation Game]]'' in 1975 while Forsyth was ill. He made many appearances on BBC TV's long running variety show ''The Good Old Days'', making huge use of his multi instrumental and performing skills.

===''Record Breakers''===
In 1972, he first presented ''[[Record Breakers]]'', a children's show, and he remained host for over 20 years. He recorded the [[Theme music|theme song]] for the show himself. While presenting the show he broke nine [[world record]]s himself, including
* Fastest [[tap-dance]] 1,440 taps per minute – 24 taps per second, set on 14 January 1973, a record that has never been bettered.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/place-london/plain/A810073 |title=h2g2 – Roy Castle – Entertainer – A810073 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=14 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theatredance.com/tap/ |title=All About Tap Dance |publisher=TheatreDance.com |date=14 January 1973 |accessdate=14 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Longest [[Wing walking|wing walk]] – 3 hours, 23 minutes.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;
* Playing the same tune on 43 different instruments in four minutes.

He was a host of the show up until a few months before his death in 1994, alongside [[Norris McWhirter|Norris]] and [[Ross McWhirter]], [[Fiona Kennedy]] and [[Cheryl Baker]]. From then on, hosting was taken over by Baker and former athlete [[Kriss Akabusi]]. It continued for 29 years until 2001, one of Britain's longest-running shows.

==Singing career==
Between 1958 and 1969, Castle recorded three [[LP album|LPs]]. One of these, ''Songs For A Rainy Day'' was recorded in 1966 for [[Columbia Records|Columbia]] and was reissued in the UK on CD by [[EMI]] Gold, re-titled ''Isn't This A Lovely Day''. The record features twelve songs with rain as the theme. British [[jazz]] players of the day [[Gordon Beck]] (piano), [[Jeff Clyne]] (bass), Leon Calvert (flugelhorn), Ike Isaacs (guitar), Ray Swinfield (flute) and [[Al Newman]] (saxophone) played on the record and it features jazz arrangements by Victor Graham covering a variety of styles such as [[big band]], ("[[Pennies from Heaven (song)|Pennies From Heaven]]", "[[Stormy Weather (song)|Stormy Weather]]"), ballads ("February Brings The Rain", "[[Here's That Rainy Day]]", "Soon It's Gonna Rain") and [[bossa nova]]s ("[[Everytime It Rains]]", "The Gentle Rain").{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

==Personal life==
Castle married dancer [[Fiona Dickson]] in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;GRO Register of Marriages: SEP 1963 6a 1063 ETON – Roy Castle = Joan F. Dickson&lt;/ref&gt; They had been introduced to each other by [[Eric Morecambe]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lovesouthend.org/profiles_detail.php?ProfileID=7 Love Southend Profiles&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Castle and his wife were committed [[Christian]]s and they regularly attended the [[Baptist]] church near their home. They had four children. Their youngest son, [[Ben Castle]] (born 1973), is a jazz saxophonist who has played with a wide range of artists, including [[Jamie Cullum]], [[Carleen Anderson]], [[Beth Rowley]], [[Marillion]] and [[Radiohead]], and performed on film soundtracks.

Castle was a [[association football|football]] fan and supported [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]. Less than six months before his death, he attended the [[Everton F.C.|Liverpool-Everton]] [[Local derby|derby match]] at [[Anfield]] on 14 March 1994 and stood on the Spion Kop terrace. He had also been in the crowd at Liverpool's [[FA Cup]] final victory over [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] in May 1992, shortly after he was first found to have cancer. At that time [[Ronnie Barker]] paid tribute to him, referring to their portrayal of characters that bore a strong resemblance to [[Laurel and Hardy]] in ''[[Another Fine Mess]]''.

On 31 December 1992, Castle was awarded the [[OBE]]. He was also a recipient of the [[Carl Alan Award]], an honour voted for by members of the professional dance industry.

==Illness and death==
Castle was diagnosed with lung cancer in March 1992, and was told that his chances of recovery were slim and that it was unlikely that he would live for more than six months. He underwent [[chemotherapy]] and [[radiotherapy]] and went into [[remission (medicine)|remission]] later that year. A non-smoker, he blamed his illness on [[passive smoking]] during his years of playing the trumpet in smoky jazz clubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/91322.stm |title=Cancer centre fulfils Roy Castle's dream|date=12 May 1998 |work=[[BBC News Online]] |publisher=BBC |accessdate=28 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 November 1993, Castle announced that his illness had returned, and once again underwent treatment in the hope of overcoming it. Several months later, he carried out the high-profile ''Tour of Hope'' to raise funds for the erection of the building that would become the [[Roy Castle Lung Cancer Foundation]], which is the only British charity dedicated solely to defeating lung cancer. By this stage, however, his condition was deteriorating and recovery was looking highly unlikely.

During and shortly after Castle's illness, many smoke-free restaurants and cafes were awarded the ''Roy Castle Clean Air Award'' to denote their adherence to a (then voluntary) smoke-free regime.

His final contribution to ''Record Breakers'' was aired at the end of the series ending in December 1993, although the programme continued until 2001.

He died in [[Buckinghamshire]] on 2 September 1994, two days after his 62nd birthday.

His widow Fiona worked with the charity after her husband's death, and campaigned for the British [[smoking ban]] which came into effect in [[Northern Ireland]] in 2004, [[Scotland]] in 2006 and [[England]] and [[Wales]] in 2007, banning smoking in virtually all enclosed [[Public space|public places]].
