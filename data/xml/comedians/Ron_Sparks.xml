He is best known as an [[alternative comedy|alternative comedian]] and frequent guest on [[CBC Radio 1]]'s [[The Debaters]], and on TV as a regular and favourite ''juror'' on [[MuchMusic]]'s highest-rated show, ''[[Video on Trial]]'', also starring as The Judge in the ''[[Stars on Trial]]'' Christmas special and various other ''VOT'' spin-offs.

==Comedian==

===Improv and sketch===
Sparks first began performing with [[York University]]'s ''Vanier Improv Company'' as a student. His [[sketch comedy|sketch]] troupe, [[The Minnesota Wrecking Crew]], were nominated four straight years (2003â€“2006) for ''Best Sketch Troupe'' [[Canadian Comedy Awards]], winning in 2003 and 2004. In 2006 they won again for ''Best Taped Live Performance'' for the [[CBC Television|CBC]] special ''[[Kevin McDonald|Sketch with Kevin McDonald]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.liveact.ca/pc_20151127.html |title=Premier Comedy|publisher=liveact.ca |date=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later became a member of the [[Canadian Comedy Award|CCA]]-nominated troupe [[Shoeless]].

===Stand-up===
He began performing stand-up in 2003 at [[The ALTdot COMedy Lounge]] and other venues around Toronto, and won that year's [[Tim Sims Award]], given to Toronto's most promising new comedy act with less than two years of experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.postcity.com/Eat-Shop-Do/Do/July-2012/Meet-a-Comedian-Ron-Sparks/ |title=Meet a Comedian: Ron Sparks|publisher=postcity.com |date=July 30, 2012 |accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then also won the 2004 Canadian Comedy Award for ''Best Stand-up Newcomer'', becoming the first person to win both. [[Frank Magazine]] described him as "the next stand-up wunderkind". &lt;br&gt;
Stand-up credits include the [[Halifax Comedy Festival|Halifax]], [[Winnipeg Comedy Festival|Winnipeg]] and [[Just for Laughs]] Comedy Festivals. He was JFL's ''Toronto Homegrown Champion'' in 2007 and has performed in various JFL and JFL-42 shows, including ''Set List'', ''The Alternative Show with [[Andy Kindler]]'', [[The Debaters]], and opening for such acts as [[Kyle Kinane]], [[Moshe Kasher]], [[Tom Green]], [[Russell Peters]] and [[Kevin Pollak]].

===Acting===
On television he starred in [[MuchMusic]]'s highest rated show ''[[Video on Trial]]'' and its spin-off, ''[[Stars on Trial]]''. He plays [[Chris Christie]] in the 2016 series You Got Trumped. He was also a regular panelist on the [[Super Channel (Canada)|Super Channel]] series [[Too Much Information]]. His [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] [[Comedy Now!]] stand-up special aired in 2008 and won a ''WorldFest International Film Festival'' Award and two ''Canadian Comedy Awards''. He has also been a regular on various [[Ed the Sock]] series (including the cult hit [[This Movie Sucks!]]) and [[The Toronto Show]]. &lt;br&gt;
Other TV credits include [[NBC]]'s [[The Firm (1982 TV Series)|The Firm]], ''[[The Beaverton (TV series)|The Beaverton]]'', [[This Hour Has 22 Minutes]], [[Meet the Family (TV series)|Meet the Family]], [[Straight Man]], ''Clumsy &amp; Shy'', [[Dark Rising|Dark Rising: The Savage Tales of Summer Vale]], [[The Jon Dore Television Show]], ''Sox in a Box'' and ''The Invasion Report''.&lt;br&gt;
He has also appeared in such films as [[Medium Raw: Night of the Wolf|Medium Raw]], [[Dark Rising]], [[By George]], Sweetener and [[Ham &amp; Cheese]].

===Radio===
Sparks is a regular and favourite guest on [[CBC Radio]]'s [[The Debaters]] (which he also writes for). He has also appeared on ''[[Brave New Waves]]'', ''[[Definitely Not the Opera]]'' and ''Out Front''. He had his own weekly segment ''The Newsdesk with Ron Sparks'' on [[CFNY-FM|102.1 The Edge]], based on his live news show.

===Writing===
Ron has written for such series as [[This Hour Has 22 Minutes]], [[Little Mosque on the Prairie]], You Got Trumped, [[Meet the Family (TV series)|Meet the Family]], [[Still Standing (Canadian TV series)|Still Standing]], [[Spun Out]], [[Life's a Zoo]], [[Satisfaction (2013 TV series)|Satisfaction]], [[Crash Canyon]], [[The Debaters]], [[This Movie Sucks]] and [[Really Me]]. He also wrote his own series of shorts for [[The Comedy Network]], ''From the Desk of Ron Sparks''.&lt;br&gt; 
Before working in television he was an award-winning playwright, with titles including ''Home to Mother'', ''A Thanksgiving That Would Even Make Great Aunt Gladys Proud'', ''Chuck Sent Me'', ''My Favourite Aunt'' and ''Richard Keats' Apartment of Doom''.

==Trivia==
He is not related to fellow comedian [[Hal Sparks]].
He is the subject of ''The Essential Actor's Guide: Spotlight on Ron Sparks'', part of a series of 32 books about actors; other subjects include [[Javier Bardem]], [[Daniel Day-Lewis]], [[Colin Firth]], [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]], [[Angelina Jolie]], [[Tommy Lee Jones]], [[Heath Ledger]], [[Brad Pitt]], [[Julia Roberts]] and [[Kate Winslet]].

===Uwe Boll===
In 2006 Sparks offered to fight [[Uwe Boll]], who had challenged his critics to a series of boxing matches leading up to the release of his movie ''[[Postal (movie)|Postal]]''. After exchanging several emails Boll ultimately declined due to Sparks's size advantage and because he would be fighting five challengers back-to-back.

===''Canadian Comedy Awards''===
At the 2007 Awards' "State of the Industry" event, Ron was unofficially voted "North America's Sexiest Comedian" after host [[Harry Doupe]] ran his name against [[Nicole Arbour]]. This was in response to Arbour having billed herself with that title despite never actually having won it anywhere. Neither comedian was in attendance.

===''Video on Trial''===

====Fake credits====
On ''Video on Trial'' he began listing himself as having fake occupations instead of just "comedian", which became a regular joke on the show. He has been billed as such things as (in order of use):
*a handsome [[bachelor]]
*a movie star
*a hand model
*a member of the [[Justice League]]
*the president of the [[Shawn Desman]] Fan Club ''(an in-joke, as Ron often made fun of Desman)''
*a [[wikt:man about town|man about town]]
*a [[Ghost Whisperer]]
*a [[haberdasher]]
*a [[vampire hunter]]
*the inventor of [[techno|techno music]] ''(during an episode featuring a techno music video)''
*a [[The Crocodile Hunter|Crocodile Hunter]]
*a [[Ninja]] [[Assassination|Assassin]]
*a [[macaroni]] artist
*a non-union [[stunt performer|stunt man]]
*star of "Sorority Shootout"
*a [[nest box|birdhouse]] architect
*"Not Cool in the '80s" (During the "80s Supertsars" episode)
*[[Santa Claus|Santa's]] Biggest [[Elf]] (During the "Holiday Crap" episode)
*[[Benson (surname)|Benson's]] [[Butler]] (Totally 80s Video on Trial)

====Stunt double====
In one episode [[Sean Cullen]] appeared briefly, credited as "Ron Sparks", after Ron said the video was too bad to watch and brought Cullen in as a "[[stunt double]]".
