'''Brian Carlo Haley''' (born February 12, 1963)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmreference.com/film/10/Brian-Haley.html Brian Haley Biography (1963–)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; is an American [[actor]] and [[stand-up comedian]]. His stand-up act is characterized by playing his all-American looks against manic outbursts and absurd situations. As an actor, he may be best known for his roles as Veeko the incompetent kidnapper in the [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]] movie ''[[Baby's Day Out]]'', the over-the-top football father Mike Hammersmith (aka Spike's dad) in ''[[Little Giants]]'', or [[Clint Eastwood]]'s son Mitch in the movie ''[[Gran Torino (film)|Gran Torino]]''.

==Early life==
Haley was born in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] to a large [[Catholic]] family, the fifth of six children. His father was an [[airline]] executive and his mother was a homemaker and part-time maid. His father is of Irish and Italian descent, which is where he gets his Italian middle name Carlo.   At the age of three his family moved to [[Saint-Jovite, Quebec]] and he was put in a boarding home where he learned to speak fluent French.  He disliked the experience so much that upon his return to Seattle 18 months later, he refused to speak the language except to translate for his younger sister, who only spoke French. He began acting as a child in the Seattle area doing community and school theater. As a teenager, he stumbled upon the film set of [[Scorchy]] (1976) in downtown Seattle.  After seeing some of the movie being filmed, jumping into a few shots as an extra and meeting the star, [[Connie Stevens]], he decided to pursue a career in show business.

At 15 he moved to rural [[Ellensburg, Washington]]. After high school, he took on several jobs, including [[lumberjack]], [[hay buck]], and ranch hand. He eventually enlisted in the US Army to join the [[Special Forces]] (the Green Berets). He was in the service from 1980 to 1985 where he won letters of commendation and the [[Army Achievement Medal]], but left early to pursue a career in show business. While in the Army (1983), he was in the play ''[[Guys and Dolls (musical)|Guys and Dolls]]'' starring [[Joe Namath]] at the [[Ft. Bragg]] Playhouse.

==Career==
After his tour in the Army, he began doing stand-up in his native Seattle and quickly rose to headliner status. In 1988, he moved to Los Angeles where he had immediate success, winning a "Hollywood's Hottest New Comic" competition, appearing on several stand-up comedy TV shows such as ''An Evening At [[The Improv]]'' and was picked up by [[ABC Television]] for a one-year holding deal. However, it was his proverbial big break on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' in 1990 that launched his career in earnest. His first appearance led to a flood of television and film roles and an HBO comedy special.

In 1994, he starred in the movie ''[[Baby's Day Out]]''.  The movie was very popular in overseas markets, especially India, where it played at the largest theater in Calcutta for over a year&lt;ref&gt;http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090806/PEOPLE/908069969 Roger Ebert Chicago Sun Times article – John Hughes: In Memory, August 6, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and was even remade with an Indian cast under the title ''[[Sisindri]]''.  In 1994, he had a stand out role in the comedy film ''[[Little Giants]]'' as over the top dad Mike Hammersmith, aka "Spike's Dad".

In 1995, he replaced [[Thomas Haden Church]] on [[NBC]]'s TV series ''[[Wings (1990 TV series)|Wings]]'' playing the part of mechanic Budd Bronski.   That same year he was in a [[Clio Award]] winning [[Super Bowl]] ad for [[Miller Lite]] beer playing hard luck football quarterback Elmer Bruker, a man that was on every winning Super Bowl team but never played.  In 1997, he portrayed "The Hooded Avenger" on the ''[[Weird Al Show]]''.  From 1998 to 1999 he played bartender Tom Vanderhulst on the short lived CBS series ''[[Maggie Winters]]''.  He has made numerous guest appearances on TV shows such as ''[[30 Rock]]'', ''[[The Drew Carey Show]]'', and ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'', including reoccurring roles on ''[[The Hughleys]]'', ''[[Third Watch]]'' and ''[[Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent]]''.

He has been cast frequently in dramatic roles, playing a detective in the [[Coen Brothers]] film ''[[The Man Who Wasn't There (2001 film)|The Man Who Wasn't There]]'' and [[Martin Scorsese]]'s ''[[The Departed]]'' and Police Captain Hill in [[Tony Scott|Tony Scott's]] ''[[The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 (2009 film)|The Taking of Pelham 123]]''. In 2003, he was cast in the [[television pilot]] for the [[CBS]] one-hour drama ''The Brotherhood of Poland New Hampshire'' as one of three brothers along with [[Randy Quaid]] and [[John Carroll Lynch]], but was replaced later by [[Chris Penn]] due to story restructuring and his lack of similarity to the other two brothers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eonline.com/news/No__quot_Brotherhood_quot__for_Kelley_Actor/45302 Eonline article No "Brotherhood" For Kelley Actor, June 11, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, he played [[Clint Eastwood]]'s discontented son Mitch in the award-winning movie ''[[Gran Torino (film)|Gran Torino]]''.

In February 2007, he appeared on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] as tennis commentator Ryan Becker in the [[Terrence McNally]] play ''[[Deuce (play)|Deuce]]'',  directed by [[Michael Blakemore]].

He currently lives in [[New York City]] and has a production company, Haleywood Productions.

He is currently doing the commentary, along with Tim Kitzrow for [[NFL Blitz (2012 video game)|NFL Blitz]].

==Personal life==
Haley owns the [[Frank Sinatra]] booth and several other items from [[Chasen's]] restaurant.  He is active with the relief organization [[World Vision]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/43800768/ns/us_news-giving/t/brian-haley-lends-hand-poverty-relief/ MSNBC article Brian Haley Lends Hand To Poverty Relief July, 20th 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
