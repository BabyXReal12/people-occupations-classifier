Debra Messing yells 'Hooray!' for 'Hollywood'|pages=|publisher=USA Today|date=2002-05-03|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/2002/2002-05-03-messing.htm|accessdate=2007-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During her [[high school]] years, she acted and sang in a number of high school productions at [[East Greenwich High School]], including the starring roles in the musicals ''[[Annie (musical)|Annie]]'' and ''[[Grease (musical)|Grease]]''. She took lessons in dance, singing, and acting. In 1986, she was [[Rhode Island]]'s Junior Miss and competed in [[Mobile, Alabama]], in the [[America's Junior Miss]] scholarship program.

While her parents encouraged her dream of becoming an actress, they also urged her to complete a [[liberal arts]] education before deciding on acting as a career. Following their advice, she attended [[Brandeis University]], where at her parents' request, three quarters of her courses were not theater related.&lt;ref name=SmashStar/&gt; During her junior year, she studied theater at the prestigious [[United Kingdom|British]] European Studies Group of [[London]] (BESGL) program, an experience that solidified her desire to act.

In 1990, after graduating ''[[Latin honors|summa cum laude]]'' from Brandeis with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in Theater Arts, Messing gained admission to the elite [[Tisch School of the Arts#Graduate Acting Program|Graduate Acting Program]] at [[New York University]]'s [[Tisch School of the Arts]], which accepts about 15 new students annually. She earned a [[Master of Fine Arts]] after three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= | title=NYU Graduate Acting Alumni | url=http://gradacting.tisch.nyu.edu/object/ga_alumbios.html | year=2011  | accessdate=2011-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In 1993, Messing won acclaim for her performance as Harper in the pre-[[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] workshop production of [[Tony Kushner]]'s play ''[[Angels in America: Perestroika]]''.&lt;ref name="actors"/&gt; Subsequently, she appeared in several episodes of the television series ''[[NYPD Blue]]'' during 1994 and 1995.

[[File:Debra Messing (April 2009) 4.jpg|thumb|left| Messing at the [[Tribeca Film Festival]] 2009 premiere of ''[[Whatever Works]]'']]

In 1995, Messing made her film debut in [[Alfonso Arau]]'s ''[[A Walk in the Clouds]]'' playing the unfaithful wife of main character Paul Sutton ([[Keanu Reeves]]). This exposure led the [[Fox network]] to make her the co-star of the television sitcom, ''[[Ned &amp; Stacey]]''. The series lasted for two seasons, from 1995 to 1997. Messing appeared as [[Jerry Seinfeld (character)|Jerry Seinfeld]]'s romantic interest in two episodes of the series ''[[Seinfeld]]'': "[[The Wait Out]]" in 1996 and "[[The Yada Yada]]" in 1997. Messing turned down a starring role in another television sitcom to appear in [[Donald Margulies]]'s two-character play ''Collected Stories'', which opened at the [[off-Broadway]] Manhattan Theater Club. She also co-starred in the [[Tom Arnold (actor)|Tom Arnold]] vehicle ''[[McHale's Navy (1997 film)|McHale's Navy]]'' in 1997.

In 1998, Messing played a lead role as the [[bioanthropology|bioanthropologist]] Sloan Parker on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s dramatic [[science fiction]] television series ''[[Prey (TV series)|Prey]]''. During this time, her agent approached her with the pilot script for the television show ''[[Will &amp; Grace]]''. Messing was inclined to take some time off, but the script intrigued her, and she auditioned for the role of [[Grace Adler]], beating out [[Nicollette Sheridan]], who later guest-starred on the show as Grace's romantic rival. ''Will &amp; Grace'' became a ratings success, and Messing became a star.&lt;ref name="actors"/&gt;

In 2002, she was named one of the "50 Most Beautiful People in the World" by ''[[People Magazine|People]]''. ''[[TV Guide]]'' picked her as its "Best Dressed Woman" in 2003. And Messing's trademark curls on ''Will &amp; Grace'' won her five Crown Awards from voters at the celebrity hair site Super-Hair.Net between 2000 and 2008.

Messing was cast by director [[Woody Allen]] in a small role in his 2002 film ''[[Hollywood Ending]]''. Her film roles since include [[Richard Gere]]'s ill-fated wife in the supernatural thriller ''[[The Mothman Prophecies (film)|The Mothman Prophecies]]'' (2002) and a supporting role as an unfaithful bride in ''[[Along Came Polly]]'' (2004). ''[[The Wedding Date]]'' (2005) was Messing's first leading role in a high-profile film. It received mixed reviews, but performed fairly well at the box office.

Messing was featured as a judge on the season finale of the second season of [[Bravo (US TV channel)|Bravo]]'s [[reality show]], ''[[Project Runway]]''. Also in 2005, along with [[Megan Mullally]], she was awarded the [[Women in Film Los Angeles|Women in Film]] [[Women in Film Crystal + Lucy Awards#THE LUCY AWARD|Lucy Award]] in recognition of her excellence and innovation in her creative works that have enhanced the perception of women through the medium of television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wif.org/past-recipients |title=Past Recipients |publisher=Wif.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/614ten37o?url=http://wif.org/past-recipients |archivedate=2011-08-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
