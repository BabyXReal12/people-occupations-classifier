He briefly attended [[Glendale Community College (California)|Glendale Community College]]. He would later use his experiences at the school to form the basis of the show ''Community''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ebright|first1=Olsen|title=NBC's "Community" Based on Glendale Community College|url=http://www.nbclosangeles.com/entertainment/television/NBC-Community-Joel-McHale-Glendale-College-59652387.html|accessdate=7 July 2014|work=NBC Los Angeles|date=September 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Early career (1996–2008)===
Harmon was a member of [[ComedySportz]] Milwaukee, alongside [[Rob Schrab]], a member of the sketch troupe The [[Dead Alewives]]. They produced an album, ''Take Down the Grand Master'', in 1996. Harmon frequently appeared at Milwaukee's Safehouse free comedy stage early in his career.  A notable routine was a song about masturbation.

Harmon co-created the television pilot ''[[Heat Vision and Jack]]'' (starring [[Owen Wilson]] and [[Jack Black]]) and several Channel 101 shows, some featuring Black, [[Drew Carey]], and [[Sarah Silverman]]. He co-created [[Comedy Central]]'s ''[[The Sarah Silverman Program]]'' and served as head writer for several episodes.

Harmon portrayed a highly fictionalized version of [[Ted Templeman]] on two episodes of the Channel 101 web series ''[[Yacht Rock (web series)|Yacht Rock]]'', a satirical history of [[soft rock]], featuring stories about Templeman's collaborations with [[The Doobie Brothers]], [[Michael McDonald (singer)|Michael McDonald]] and [[Van Halen]]. He was the creator, executive producer, and a featured performer in ''[[Acceptable.TV]]'', a Channel 101-based sketch show airing for eight episodes in March 2007 on [[VH1]]. He and Rob Schrab co-wrote the screenplay for the [[Academy Award]]-nominated film ''[[Monster House (film)|Monster House]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|1363595}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is credited with writing part of Rob Schrab's comic book series ''[[Scud: The Disposable Assassin]]'', as well as the spin-off comic series ''La Cosa Nostroid''.

===''Community'' (2009–2012; 2014–2015)===
In 2009, Harmon's sitcom ''[[Community (TV series)|Community]]'', inspired by his own community college experiences, was picked up by [[NBC]] to be in its fall lineup. Harmon served as executive producer and [[showrunner]] for 3 seasons until May 18, 2012, when it was announced that Harmon was being terminated from his position on ''Community'' as a result of creative conflicts between himself and Sony executives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rose|first1=Lacey|title='Community's' Dan Harmon Reveals the Wild Story Behind His Firing and Rehiring|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/communitys-dan-harmon-reveals-wild-586084|accessdate=7 July 2014|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=July 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 1, 2013, Harmon announced that he would be returning to ''Community'', serving as co-showrunner along with [[Chris McKenna (writer)|Chris McKenna]];&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, Connor (2013-06-01).

===''Harmontown'' and ''HarmonQuest'' (2011–present)===
On May 23, 2011, Harmon began hosting a monthly live comedy show and podcast at Meltdown Comics in [[Hollywood]] called ''[[Harmontown]]''. After his firing from ''Community'', the show became weekly. The show is co-hosted by [[Jeff B. Davis]]. Notably, Harmontown has featured a regular segment where the hosts played an ongoing campaign of [[pen-and-paper role-playing game]]s, first ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'', and later ''[[Shadowrun]]'', with the help of show Game Master Spencer Crittenden. The segment inspired the [[Seeso]] original animated series [[HarmonQuest]]. The show has featured guests, such as [[Kumail Nanjiani]], [[Curtis Armstrong]], [[Bobcat Goldthwait]], [[Mitch Hurwitz]], [[Aubrey Plaza]], [[Eric Idle]], [[Greg Proops]], [[Jason Sudekis]], [[Zoe Lister-Jones]], [[Ryan Stiles]], as well as Harmon's ex-wife, podcaster [[Erin McGathy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Twitter Page of Erin McGathy|url=https://twitter.com/ErinMcGathy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harmon and Davis took the show on tour in early 2013, broadcasting from [[Austin]], [[Nashville]], [[Somerville, Massachusetts]], [[Brooklyn]], [[Rhode Island]], and more. The tour became the subject of a documentary produced by director Neil Berkeley that follows Harmon, Davis, McGathy, and Crittenden. The documentary, also called ''Harmontown'', premiered at the [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] Film Festival [[SXSW]] on March 8, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=DeFore|first=John|title=Harmontown: SXSW Review|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/harmontown-sxsw-review-687305|accessdate=April 10, 2014|newspaper=Hollywood Reporter|date=March 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lies|first=Erica|title=Diving Into the Cult of Dan Harmon in 'Harmontown'|url=http://splitsider.com/2014/04/diving-into-the-cult-of-harmon-in-harmontown/|accessdate=April 10, 2014|newspaper=Splitsider|date=April 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Rick and Morty'' (2013–present)===
Harmon and co-showrunner, [[Justin Roiland]], began developing ideas for an animated show during Harmon's yearlong break from ''Community''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cohen|first1=Ivan|title=Dan Harmon and Justin Roiland on 'Rick and Morty', How 'Community' Is Like 'Star Trek', and Puberty|url=http://www.vulture.com/2014/01/rick-and-morty-dan-harmon-and-justin-roiland-interview.html|accessdate=7 July 2014|work=Vulture|date=January 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; For its fall 2012 season, [[Adult Swim]] ordered a 30-minute animated pilot from Harmon and Roiland. The pilot, ''[[Rick and Morty]]'', is about the adventures of a brilliant but mean-spirited inventor and his less-than-genius grandson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/adult-swim-pilots-community-harold-kumar-324657 |title=Upfronts 2012: Adult Swim Orders Eight Pilots, Including a Project From 'Community's' Dan Harmon |work=Hollywood Reporter |first=Lacey |last=Rose |date=May 15, 2012 |accessdate=May 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show premiered on December 2, 2013 and was renewed for a second season.&lt;ref name=HollywoodReporter&gt;{{cite news|last=Goldberg|first=Leslie|title=Dan Harmon's 'Rick and Morty' Renewed for Second Season|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/dan-harmons-rick-morty-renewed-679875|accessdate=March 27, 2014|newspaper=Hollywood Reporter|date=February 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series’ third season concluded in October 2017. Harmon voiced the recurring character of Bird Person.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb episode|4832266|Rick and Morty: Get Schwifty}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2018, Rick and Morty was renewed for a further 70 episodes after Harmon and Roiland came to an agreement with Adult Swim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/rick-and-morty-renewed-adult-swim-1202805945/|title=‘Rick and Morty’ Scores 70-Episode Order at Adult Swim|last=Otterson|first=Joe|date=2018-05-10|work=Variety|access-date=2018-05-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Sirens of Titan'' (TBA)===
It was announced that [[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s 1959 novel ''[[The Sirens of Titan]]'' would be made into a television series and would be adapted by Dan Harmon and [[Evan Katz]].&lt;ref name=CinemaBlend&gt;

=="Story Circle" technique==

[[File:Embryo-dan-harmon-600x364.jpg|300px|thumb|right|alt=A hand-drawn version of Harmon's story circle.|Harmon's illustrated story technique]]
Harmon has invented a storytelling framework referred to as the "Story Circle."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2011/09/mf_harmon/all/|title=How Dan Harmon Drives Himself Crazy Making Community|last=Raftery|first=Brian|date=September 22, 2011|website=Wired}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began developing the technique in the late ’90s, while stuck on a screenplay. He wanted to codify the storytelling process — to find the structure powering movies and TV shows. "I was thinking, there must be some symmetry to this," Harmon told Wired. "Some simplicity."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; While working on [[Channel 101]], Harmon found that many of the directors he was working with claimed that they were unable to write plots for television shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej_aFOnT04g|title = Dan Harmon, Community - XOXO Festival (2012)|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This caused Harmon to distill [[Joseph Campbell]]'s structure of the [[Monomyth]] into a simple, circular eight-step process that would reliably produce coherent stories.

The story circle supposedly can be applied to all stories. Harmon uses it whenever he's writing a new story, saying "I can't not see that circle. It's tattooed on my brain."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The circle is divided into eight segments, each representing a stage of the plot. A character is introduced, wants something, enters a new environment, adapts to that environment, achieves their goal but encounters problems as a result, leaves that world and changes as a result. The steps are as follows:
# A character is in a zone of comfort or familiarity.
# They desire something.
# They enter an unfamiliar situation.
# They adapt to that situation.
# They get that which they wanted.
# They pay a heavy price for it.
# They return to their familiar situation.
# They have changed as a result of the journey.

Joseph Campbell's structure of the Monomyth is the main influence in Harmon's technique. In a blog post detailing the second sector of the circle Harmon explains, "The point of this part of the circle is, our protagonist has been thrown into the water and now it's sink or swim. In ''[[Hero with a Thousand Faces]]'', Campbell actually evokes the image of a digestive tract, breaking the hero down, divesting him of neuroses, stripping him of fear and desire. There's no room for bullshit in the unconscious basement. Asthma inhalers, eyeglasses, credit cards, fratty boyfriends, promotions, toupees and cell phones can't save you here. The purpose here has become refreshingly - and frighteningly - simple."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://channel101.wikia.com/wiki/Story_Structure_104:_The_Juicy_Details|title=Story Structure 104: The Juicy Details|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Monomyth has been adapted for screen and television writing before, most notably by former [[Disney]] developmental executive [[Christopher Vogler]] in his book ''[[The Writer's Journey: Mythic Structure for Writers]]''. Harmon has noted this book as an influence on the embryo technique, as well as the work of [[Syd Field]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Harmon states that this circular structure of storytelling can be applied both to film and TV, suggesting in a [[Channel 101]] blog that only the final intentions are different. "A feature film’s job is to send you out of the theatre on a high in 90 minutes. Television’s job is to keep you glued to the television for your entire life. This doesn’t entail making stories any less circular (TV circles are so circular they’re sometimes irritatingly predictable). It just means that the focus of step 8 is less riling-things-up and more getting-things-back-to-where-they-started," he says.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Harmon has used the Story Embryo technique extensively throughout projects such as ''Community''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://danharmon.tumblr.com/post/75209394079/some-community-whiteboards-for-episodes-1-and-2|title=Some Community whiteboards for episodes 1 and 2.|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Rick and Morty''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/fictionhub/rick-and-morty-writers-room-c2b79d6fe43c#.ngyyaswgr|title=Rick and Morty writer’s room|last=|first=|date=|website=Medium|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview on [[Collider (website)|Collider]] writer, Adam Chitwood said, "The show [''Rick and Morty''] debuted in 2013 to a serious degree of anticipation, as it marked a new animated venture for ''Community'' creator Dan Harmon, but it was the marriage of Harmon’s adeptness for structure and character and co-creator [[Justin Roiland]]'s insanely creative/sometimes insane mind that made Rick and Morty much more than just another animated TV series for adults."

Fans and critics have retroactively applied Harmon's Story Circle to other shows, such as ''[[Breaking Bad]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://imgur.com/a/CHgAo#0|title=Breaking Bad through Dan Harmon's Story Circle|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harmon's technique has been adopted by Irish sitcom writer [[Graham Linehan]], the creator of shows such as ''[[Father Ted]]'', ''[[The IT Crowd]]'', and ''[[Black Books]]''. In an interview with the Telegraph, Linehan said: "Whenever I write for television, I plan the story on whiteboard wallpaper in my office, using a system created by the American writer Dan Harmon, saying, 'It's remarkably simple: a character wants something; they enter a new world and adapt to it; they get what they want, re-enter the old world and change.' The great thing about it is that once you have an idea for one bit, the section opposite comes naturally, as do the ones on either side, and so on. It's basically a distillation of the 'hero's journey' idea, but it’s undetectable and applies to any ideas, big or small."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/11351923/Does-this-circle-represent-every-TV-show-and-film-there-is.html|title=Does this circle represent every TV show and film there is?|last=|first=|date=|website=The Telegraph|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
In July 2009, Harmon was nominated in two [[Emmy]] categories for his part in writing the Oscar telecast: Outstanding Writing for a Variety, Music or Comedy Special and Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics, the latter of which he was awarded for "[[Hugh Jackman]] Opening Number" at the [[61st Primetime Emmy Awards]].

==Personal life==
In 2011, while writing the character Abed for ''Community'', Dan discovered he might have a form of [[Asperger syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Lyons|first = Margaret|title = Community’s Dan Harmon Discovered He had Asperger’s While Writing Abed’s Character|website = Vulture|url = http://www.vulture.com/2011/09/community-dan-harmon-wired-aspergers-abed.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2013, Harmon proposed to his girlfriend [[Erin McGathy]].&lt;ref name=Instagram&gt;{{cite web|last=McGathy|first=Erin|title=Erin McGathy, "Engaged!"|url=http://instagram.com/p/iesS5ICYRT/#|work=Instagram|publisher=Instagram.com|accessdate=March 27, 2014|date=December 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two married in November 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://uproxx.com/tv/2014/11/community-showrunner-dan-harmon-got-married-this-weekend-and-the-wedding-was-amazing/|title= ‘Community’ Showrunner Dan Harmon Got Married This Weekend, And The Wedding Was Amazing|last1= Rowles|first1= Dustin|date= 17 November 2014|website= Uproxx|publisher= |accessdate=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They announced they were divorcing in October 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1 = McGathy|first1 = Erin|url = https://twitter.com/ErinMcGathy/status/653001328789098497|website = Twitter|accessdate = 11 October 2015|title = Twitter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Misconduct ===
On January 2, 2018, Dan Harmon alluded to misconduct from himself towards other people. [[Megan Ganz]], a writer who worked with Harmon on ''Community'' responded, naming herself as a victim in said misconduct. Harmon responded by attempting a dialogue with Ganz, wherein he attempted to apologize, and though Ganz said she appreciated his gestures, she declined to forgive him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barsanti|first1=Sam|title=Former Community writer Megan Ganz calls out Dan Harmon for misconduct|url=https://www.avclub.com/former-community-writer-megan-ganz-calls-out-dan-harmon-1821754073|website=The A.V. Club|publisher=The A.V. Club|accessdate=4 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the exchange, Harmon made a lengthy apology on his podcast ''[[Harmontown]]'' where he went into detail about his wrongdoings which included making advances on her and then mistreating her after she turned him down. Ganz said that she felt vindicated by the admission and accepted his apology, saying "Dan Harmon, I forgive you".&lt;ref&gt;Dan Harmon I forgive you

=== Baby doll video controversy ===
In July 2018, Harmon deleted his Twitter account after a 2009 comedy skit surfaced in which acted out a rape using a baby doll as a prop. The video, titled "Daryl" was intended to be parody of the [[Dexter (TV series)|Dexter]] TV series. Harmon later apologized for the video. Nearly a day after the video surfaced, Adult Swim released a statement criticizing the video while noting Harmon's apology. &lt;ref&gt;Little, Morgan, [https://www.cnet.com/news/rick-and-mortys-dan-harmon-deletes-twitter-after-controversial-video-emerges/ Rick and Morty's Dan Harmon apologizes for baby doll video, Adult Swim forgives him] [[CNET]] 23 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt;
