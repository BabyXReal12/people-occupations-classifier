==Career==

===Early work===
Green's first movie roles were in the 1984 films ''Billions for Boris'' and ''[[The Hotel New Hampshire (film)|The Hotel New Hampshire]]'', the second film cast him alongside [[Jodie Foster]] and [[Rob Lowe]]. He appeared in the 1987 film ''[[Can't Buy Me Love (film)|Can't Buy Me Love]]'', playing [[Patrick Dempsey]]'s character's little brother, Chuckie Miller. He starred in [[Woody Allen]]'s ''[[Radio Days]]'' ([[1987 in film|1987]]) as Joe, a 1930s–1940s boy based on Allen, and appeared in ''[[Big Business (1988 film)|Big Business]]'' (1988) and, in the same year, in ''[[My Stepmother Is an Alien]]'', which also starred ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' co-star [[Alyson Hannigan]].

In 1984, Green portrayed [[Carl Switzer|Carl "Alfalfa" Switzer]] in the Jell-O Gelatin Pops commercials featuring ''[[The Little Rascals]]''. In 1991, Green rose to fame in a [[Rally's]] "Cha Ching" commercial,&lt;ref name=Rallys&gt;{{cite web|title=1992-USA - Rally's|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4lZINjpACE|accessdate=December 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rumour&gt;{{cite web|title=Rally's Rumor: 'Cha-ching' Guy Really Didn't Die|url=http://articles.dailypress.com/1993-01-13/features/9301130063_1_eastman-kodak-co-s-center-evening-shade-imitrex|publisher=Dailypress.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; which earned him an appearance at a [[1991 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans Saints]] game. Green was given a key to [[New Orleans]] in honor of his role in the popular commercial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyAYjw3GPmk|title=CHA-CHING|last=Wells|first=Ken|publisher=WVUE-TV|date=December 16, 1991|accessdate=June 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Green appeared in the horror films ''[[It (1990 film)|It]]'' (as Richie Tozier, age 12) and [[Ticks (film)|''Ticks'']], all three ''[[Austin Powers (film series)|Austin Powers]]'' movies as Dr. Evil's son, Scott, and ''[[Enemy of the State (film)|Enemy of the State]]'' and ''[[The Italian Job (2003 film)|The Italian Job]]'' as a computer specialist. He was also in the films ''[[Can't Hardly Wait]]'', ''[[Rat Race (film)|Rat Race]]'', ''[[Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed]]'', ''[[Without a Paddle]]'', ''[[Idle Hands]]'', ''[[Party Monster (2003 film)|Party Monster]]'', and ''[[Old Dogs (film)|Old Dogs]]''.

In 1994, he starred alongside [[Jennifer Love Hewitt]] in the short-lived series ''[[The Byrds of Paradise]]''. He worked with Hewitt again in 1998's ''[[Can't Hardly Wait]]''. Seth is not related to [[Bruce Seth Green]], who directed some episodes of ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer''. On occasion, some sources confuse the two and have credited Seth as the director. As an actor in the series, he was close to co-star Alyson Hannigan because they were lovers in the show. He played a calm, mild-mannered band member who gets turned into a werewolf. He is very popular among fans of the series. Green has starred on Fox's ''[[Greg the Bunny]]'' and guest-starred on ''[[The X-Files]]'', ''[[That '70s Show]]'', ''[[Will &amp; Grace]]'', ''[[MADtv]]'', ''[[Reno 911!]]'', ''[[Entourage (U.S. TV series)|Entourage]]'', ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'', ''[[The Wonder Years]]'', ''[[Heroes (TV series)|Heroes]]'','' [[The Facts of Life (TV series)|The Facts of Life]]'', ''[[The Drew Carey Show]]'', and ''[[My Name Is Earl]]''.

The series centers on the dysfunctional [[Griffin family]] and also stars [[Seth MacFarlane]], [[Alex Borstein]], [[Mila Kunis]], and [[Mike Henry (voice actor)|Mike Henry]].

==Personal life==
After getting engaged on New Year's Eve in 2009, Green married actress [[Clare Grant]] on May 1, 2010 in Northern California.&lt;ref name=Bio&gt;{{cite |title=Seth Green- Biography|url=https://movies.yahoo.com/person/seth-green/biography.html|publisher=Yahoo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two currently live in [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name=TVBio&gt;{{cite web|title=Seth Green Biography|url=http://www.tvguide.com/celebrities/seth-green/bio/174265|work=TVGuide}}&lt;/ref&gt; They worked together on ''[[Robot Chicken]]'', ''[[Warren the Ape]]'', and her "[[Geek and Gamer Girls Song]]" [[viral video]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.break.com/break-originals/other-funny-stuff/geek-and-gamer-girls-anthem |title=Break.com: G33k &amp; G4m3r Girls Song. |publisher= |accessdate=27 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130426055127/http://www.break.com/break-originals/other-funny-stuff/geek-and-gamer-girls-anthem |archivedate=26 April 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://actionflickchick.com/superaction/interview-seth-green/ Interview: Why Seth Green Loves Geek and Gamer Girls].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Green stated, "God is, to me, pretty much an idea. God is, to me, pretty much a myth created over time to deny the idea that we're all responsible for our own actions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/is-there-a-god-1394|title=Is there a God?|first=Stephen|last=Thompson|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later clarified in 2013:

{{blockquote|text=I believe that everyone is entitled to their own opinion. I find it sad and unfortunate how many wars are fought and lives are lost in a quest to insist that someone else pray the same way you do. I have a deep belief in the divinity of the Universe, and I had no ability to really comprehend the scope or magnitude of all the things that I don't understand. But I've never been the guy who says 'I don't believe in God' or 'I don't believe in some kind of overlaying, governing force that makes everything symmetrical' and I've never been interested in being anyone's spokesman, whether it's organized religion or the opposite. I'm my own spokesperson. I take great pains to always say I only speak for me.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ml9cw/seth_green_here_actorproducer_writer_director/ccabwd4|title=Seth Green here.
