'''Dana John Gould''' (born August 24, 1964) is an [[United States|American]] stand-up comedian, actor, writer and voice artist who has been featured on [[HBO]], [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]], and [[Comedy Central]].

==Early life==
Gould was born in [[Hopedale, Massachusetts]] on August 24, 1964, the fifth of six children. He was raised Roman Catholic, and served as an altar boy in the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Worcester]].{{cn|date=July 2018}}

==Career==
Gould began performing comedy onstage at age 17. After high school, he studied communications and theatre at the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]], but after a year moved to [[San Francisco]] to pursue a career in comedy. It was there he, along with fellow comedian Alex Reid, founded the [[San Francisco Comedy Condo]] in 1986.

Gould wrote and performed on ''[[The Ben Stiller Show]]''; one such sketch features Gould as Otto, Cupid's twisted brother, whose arrows convince a young man to fall madly in love with an elderly woman. Another series of sketches features a heavily disguised Gould as [[Wilford Brimley]] advertising "Grady's Oats" (a parody of Brimley's [[Quaker Oats]] advertisements). In one, he speaks of his Uncle Ray's hobby of dressing in a pink taffeta gown and filling his panties with oatmeal; in another, he brandishes a revolver through the window at children. He also appeared in an episode of ''[[MADtv]]'' as [[Newt Gingrich]] and on one episode of ''[[Seinfeld]]'' ("[[The Junk Mail]]") as "Fragile" Frankie Merman, Jerry's childhood friend (also known as "The Summer George"). He co-created and was executive producer on ''[[Super Adventure Team]]''. In addition, Gould's stand up material was featured in [[Comedy Central|Comedy Central's]] animated series ''[[Shorties Watchin' Shorties]]''.&lt;ref&gt;comedycentral.com&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, Gould appeared in the episode "Supermarket Story" of ''[[The King of Queens]]''.

For seven years, he wrote for ''[[The Simpsons]]'', one episode of which he provided the voice of [[Don Knotts]] as [[Barney Fife]] (an impression that originated in his stand-up routine). He left the show in late 2006 in order to focus on his own screenwriting, though he served as co-executive producer on seasons 14 through 18.

Gould had a featured cameo in ''[[Girls Will Be Girls (film)|Girls Will Be Girls]]'', in which he played a hit-and-run victim who admits to his alcohol problem after having a desperate [[one-night stand]] with aging C-list actress Evie Harris, the other driver in the car accident. He was also featured in  ''[[The Aristocrats (film)|The Aristocrats]]'', where, among other commentary, he presents an Amish version of the [[The Aristocrats (joke)|eponymous joke]]. His short films, ''Last Man On Earth'', ''Break On Through With J.F.K.'', ''A Night On Java Island'', and ''Soul Mates'' are also available for download on his site. Except for the latter, all feature Gould in acting roles. 2009 saw the release of his new stand up special, "Let Me Put My Thoughts In You" on [[Shout! Factory]].

Gould provided the voice for the title character in the U.S. versions of the [[Gex (series)|''Gex'' video game series]] and the U.K. version of the first game. Gould, with his frequent writing partner [[Robert Cohen (comedy writer)|Rob Cohen]], wrote the majority of the jokes for the games. Gould also voiced Hi Larious in ''[[Father of the Pride]]''.

He was a regular contributor to the [[Adam Carolla]] [[The Adam Carolla Show (terrestrial radio)|radio show]] where he did impressions of [[Huell Howser]]. He appears occasionally on [[The Adam Carolla Show (podcast)|''The Adam Carolla Show'' podcast]]. The first episode of Gould's own podcast ''The Dana Gould Hour''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Dana Gould Hour|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-dana-gould-hour/id499464663|accessdate=25 April 2012 |publisher=iTunes}}&lt;/ref&gt; was made available on iTunes on January 31, 2012. Recurring guests include comedians like [[Eddie Pepitone]], and each episode revolves around a singular theme. Currently, a new episode of ''The Dana Gould Hour'' is released about every two months.

In 2010, he appeared in live action on the ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode "[[Brian Writes a Bestseller]]."

In 2013, Gould appeared with [[Melinda Hill]] and [[Scott Shriner]]&lt;ref name=Carrie&gt;{{cite web|last=Carrie|first=Stephanie|title=Steph’s LA Weekly Feature Series – Melinda Hill’s Romantic Encounters|url=http://tangledwebwewatch.com/2013/07/17/stephs-la-weekly-feature-series-melinda-hills-romantic-encounters/ |work=Tangled Web We Watch |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160319001821/http://tangledwebwewatch.com/2013/07/17/stephs-la-weekly-feature-series-melinda-hills-romantic-encounters/ |date=2013-07-17 |archivedate=2016-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  in an episode of the web series [[Romantic Encounters]].&lt;ref name=Gutelle&gt;{{cite web|last=Gutelle|first=Sam|title=Melinda Hill Seeking ‘Romantic Encounters’ On My Damn Channel Network|url=http://www.tubefilter.com/2013/06/26/romantic-encounters-my-damn-channel-comedy-network-melinda-hill/|work=[[Tubefilter]]|date=2013-06-26 |accessdate=23 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also frequently performs live shows with comedian [[Arden Myrin]] as "The Tinkle Twins."

In 2014, Gould participated as a comedian on Playboy's "Foursome: Walk of Shame" where he joined other comedians in making fun of the program's contestants.
