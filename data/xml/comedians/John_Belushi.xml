'''John Adam Belushi''' (January 24, 1949 – March 5, 1982) was an American comedian, actor, and singer. Belushi is best known for his "intense energy and raucous attitude"&lt;ref name="BrowneBrowne2001"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Browne|first1=Ray Broadus|last2=Browne|first2=Pat|title=The Guide to United States Popular Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U3rJxPYT32MC&amp;pg=PA78|accessdate=September 10, 2014|year=2001|publisher=Popular Press|isbn=9780879728212|pages=78–}}&lt;/ref&gt; which he displayed as one of the seven [[Saturday Night Live cast members|original cast members]] of the [[NBC]] sketch comedy show ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (''SNL''). Throughout his career, Belushi had a close personal and artistic partnership with his fellow ''SNL'' star [[Dan Aykroyd]], whom he met while they were both working at [[Chicago]]'s [[The Second City]] comedy club.&lt;ref name="Sellers2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sellers|first=Robert|title=An A-Z of Hellraisers: A Comprehensive Compendium of Outrageous Insobriety|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NbpGJnRyY3gC&amp;pg=PT53|accessdate=September 10, 2014|date=May 20, 2010|publisher=Random House|isbn=9781409051008|pages=53–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in [[Chicago]] to [[Albanian American]] parents, Belushi started his own comedy troupe with [[Tino Insana]] and Steve Beshekas, called "The West Compass Trio", which was met with success. Belushi was offered a chance to perform with The Second City after being discovered by [[Bernard Sahlins]]. There, he met [[Brian Doyle-Murray]] and [[Harold Ramis]]. He also met Aykroyd, who would later become one of his close associates.

In 1975, Belushi was recommended to ''SNL'' creator/showrunner [[Lorne Michaels]] by [[Chevy Chase]] and [[Michael O'Donoghue]], who accepted Belushi as a new cast member of the show after an audition. He developed a series of characters on the show that reached high success, including his notable performances such as [[Henry Kissinger]] and [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]. After his breakout and best-known film role as John "Bluto" Blutarsky, the lead in ''[[Animal House|National Lampoon's Animal House]]'' (1978), Belushi later took an interest in films such as ''[[1941 (film)|1941]]'', ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]'', and ''[[Neighbors (1981 film)|Neighbors]]''. He also pursued interests in music, creating with Aykroyd, [[Lou Marini]], [[Tom Malone (musician)|Tom Malone]], [[Steve Cropper]], [[Donald "Duck" Dunn]], and [[Paul Shaffer]], [[the Blues Brothers]], from which the film received its name.

In his personal life, Belushi struggled with heavy drug use that affected his comedy career, and was dismissed and rehired by Michaels on several occasions due to his behavior. In 1982, Belushi died from [[combined drug intoxication]] caused by an injection of a [[heroin]] and [[cocaine]] mixture, known as a [[Speedball (drug)|speedball]]. He was posthumously honored with a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] in 2004.

==Early life==
Belushi's mother, Agnes Demetri (Samaras), was the daughter of [[Albanians|Albanian]] immigrants, and his father, Adam Anastos Belushi, was an Albanian emigrant from [[Qytezë]].&lt;ref name="MarionOliver2014"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marion|first1=Nancy E|last2=Oliver|first2=Willard M.|title=Drugs in American Society: An Encyclopedia of History, Politics, Culture, and the Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c5PgBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT224 |accessdate=May 28, 2015 |date=December 16, 2014 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=9781610695961|pages= 224–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Born in [[Humboldt Park, Chicago|Humboldt Park]], a neighborhood on the [[West Side, Chicago|West Side]] of [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], John was raised in [[Wheaton, Illinois|Wheaton]], a suburb west of Chicago, along with his three siblings: younger brothers Billy and [[Jim Belushi|Jim]], and sister Marian.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web| url= http://www.nbc.com/Saturday_Night_Live/bios/John_Belushi.shtml | title= John Belushi | website= NBC.com |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090206023624/http://nbc.com/Saturday_Night_Live/bios/john_belushi.shtml |archivedate=February 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E00E2DD153BF931A35755C0A9629482 |title= 60 Books Of The Times; Close-Up Of John Belushi | work = The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Belushi was raised in the [[Orthodox Autocephalous Church of Albania|Albanian Orthodox Church]] and attended [[Wheaton Warrenville South High School|Wheaton Community High School]], where he met his future wife, [[Judith Belushi Pisano|Judith Jacklin]]. 

In 1965, Belushi formed a band, the Ravens, together with four fellow high school students (Dick Blasucci, Michael Blasucci, Tony Pavolonis, and Phil Special). They recorded one single, "Listen to Me Now"/"Jolly Green Giant". Belushi played drums and sang vocals. The record was not successful, and the band broke up when he enrolled at the [[College of DuPage]].

==Career==

===The Second City and National Lampoon===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:John at Second City in Chicago, 1971.jpg|thumb|right|Belushi at Second City in Chicago, 1971]] --&gt;
Belushi started his own comedy troupe in Chicago, The West Compass Trio (named after the improvisational cabaret revue [[Compass Players]] active from 1955–1958 in Chicago), with [[Tino Insana]] and Steve Beshekas. Their success piqued the interest of [[Bernard Sahlins]], the founder of [[The Second City]] improvised comedy enterprise, who went to see them performing in 1971 and immediately asked Belushi to join the cast.&lt;ref name="Sellers2010"/&gt; At Second City, he met and began working with [[Harold Ramis]] and [[Brian Doyle-Murray]].&lt;ref name="Sellers2010"/&gt; 

In 1972 Belushi was offered a role, together with [[Chevy Chase]] and [[Christopher Guest]], in ''[[National Lampoon Lemmings]]'',&lt;ref name="BrowneBrowne2001"/&gt; a parody of [[Woodstock]], which played [[Off-Broadway|off Broadway]] in 1972. Belushi and Jacklin moved to New York City. Belushi started working as a writer, director and actor for  ''[[The National Lampoon Radio Hour]]'', a comedy radio show which was created, produced and written by staff from [[National Lampoon magazine|''National Lampoon'' magazine]].&lt;ref name=NPR&gt;{{cite web|work=[[NPR]]|title='The National Lampoon Radio Hour'|date=November 17, 2003|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1505048}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a trip to [[Toronto]] to check out the local Second City cast in 1974, he met [[Dan Aykroyd]].&lt;ref name="BrowneBrowne2001"/&gt; Jacklin became an associate producer for the show, and she and Belushi were married on December 31, 1976.

===''Saturday Night Live''===
In 1975 Chevy Chase and writer [[Michael O'Donoghue]] recommended Belushi to [[Lorne Michaels]] as a potential member for a television show Michaels was about to produce called ''Saturday Night'' a.k.a. ''Saturday Night Live'' (''SNL''). Michaels was initially undecided, as he was not sure if Belushi's physical humor would fit with what he was envisioning, but he changed his mind after giving Belushi an audition.&lt;ref name="BrowneBrowne2001"/&gt; 

Over his four-year tenure at ''SNL'', Belushi developed a series of successful characters, including the belligerent [[Saturday Night Live Samurai|Samurai Futaba]], [[Henry Kissinger]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven]], the Greek owner of the [[Olympia Café]], Captain [[James T. Kirk]], and a contributor of furious opinion pieces on ''[[Weekend Update]]'', during which he coined his catchphrase, "But N-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O!"&lt;ref name="BrowneBrowne2001"/&gt; With Aykroyd, Belushi created Jake and Elwood, [[the Blues Brothers]]. Originally intended to warm up the crowd before the show, the Blues Brothers were eventually featured as music guests.&lt;ref name="Epstein2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Epstein|first= Lawrence Jeffrey|title= Mixed Nuts: America's Love Affair with Comedy Teams : from Burns and Allen to Belushi and Aykroyd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8g6YQTuBYQ8C&amp;pg=PA223|accessdate=September 10, 2014|year=2004|publisher= PublicAffairs |isbn=9781586481902|pages= 223–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Belushi also reprised his Lemmings imitation of [[Joe Cocker]]. Cocker himself joined Belushi in 1976 to sing ''[[Feelin' Alright?|Feeling Alright]]'' together.

Like many of his fellow ''SNL'' cast members, Belushi began experimenting heavily with drugs to deal with the constant pressure. His unpredictable temper caused him to be fired (and immediately re-hired) by Michaels a number of times.&lt;ref name="Parish2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Parish|first= James Robert|title=The Hollywood Book of Extravagance: The Totally Infamous, Mostly Disastrous, and Always Compelling Excesses of America's Film and TV Idols|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CJS5RL7eqdsC&amp;pg=PA102|accessdate=September 10, 2014|date=January 6, 2011 |publisher= John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn= 9781118039021|pages=102–}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s February 2015 appraisal of all 141 ''SNL'' cast members to that time, Belushi received the top ranking.  "Belushi was the 'live' in ''Saturday Night Live''", they wrote, "the one who made the show happen on the edge ... Nobody embodied the highs and lows of ''SNL'' like Belushi."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title= 'Saturday Night Live': All 145 Cast Members Ranked | work= Rolling Stone | number= 1229 | date= February 26, 2015| page= 32 | url= https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/lists/saturday-night-live-all-141-cast-members-ranked-20150211 | accessdate= February 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expansion into films===
In 1978, he performed in the films ''[[Old Boyfriends]]'' (directed by [[Joan Tewkesbury]]), ''[[Goin' South]]'' (directed by [[Jack Nicholson]]), and ''[[Animal House]]'' (directed by [[John Landis]]). Upon its initial release, ''Animal House'' received generally mixed reviews from critics, but ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' and [[Roger Ebert]] proclaimed it one of the year's best. Filmed for $2.8 million, it is one of the most profitable movies of all time, garnering an estimated gross of more than $141 million in the form of theatrical rentals and home video, not including merchandising. ''Animal House'' was also largely responsible for defining and launching the [[Gross out|gross-out genre]] of films, which became one of Hollywood's staples.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.animalhouse.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the success of The Blues Brothers on ''SNL'', Belushi and Aykroyd, with the help of pianist-arranger [[Paul Shaffer]], started assembling studio talents to form a proper band. These included ''SNL'' saxophonist "Blue" [[Lou Marini]] and trombonist-saxophonist [[Tom Malone (musician)|Tom Malone]], who had previously played in [[Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears]]. At Shaffer's suggestion, guitarist [[Steve Cropper]] and bassist [[Donald "Duck" Dunn]], the powerhouse combo from [[Booker T and the M.G.'s]] and subsequently almost every hit out of Memphis's [[Stax Records]] during the 1960s, were signed as well.&lt;ref&gt;In his biography of Belushi, ''[[Wired (book)|Wired: The Short Life and Fast Times of John Belushi]],'' [[Bob Woodward]] learned, from the numerous interviews he conducted, that Belushi recruited Cropper and Dunn by "alternating good-natured jokes and hard sell."&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978 The Blues Brothers released their debut album, ''[[Briefcase Full of Blues]]'', with Atlantic Records. The album reached #1 on the Billboard 200 and went double platinum. Two singles were released, "Rubber Biscuit", which reached number 37 on the Billboard Hot 100 and "Soul Man", which reached number 14.

In 1979, Belushi left ''Saturday Night Live'' with Aykroyd to pursue a film career.  They made three movies together, ''[[1941 (film)|1941]]'' (directed by [[Steven Spielberg]]), ''[[Neighbors (1981 film)|Neighbors]]'' (directed by [[John Avildsen]]), and most notably ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]'' (directed by John Landis). Released in the United States on June 20, 1980, ''The Blues Brothers'' received generally positive reviews. It earned just under $5 million in its opening weekend and went on to gross $115.2 million in theaters worldwide before its release on home video. The Blues Brothers band toured to promote the film, which led to a third album (and second live album), ''[[Made in America (The Blues Brothers album)|Made in America]]'', recorded at the Universal Amphitheatre in 1980. The track "Who's Making Love" peaked at No 39.

The only film Belushi made without Aykroyd following his departure from ''SNL'' was the romantic comedy ''[[Continental Divide (film)|Continental Divide]]'' (directed by [[Michael Apted]]). Released in September 1981, it starred Belushi as [[Chicago]] home town hero writer Ernie Souchack (loosely based on newspaper columnist and long-time family friend [[Mike Royko]]), who gets an assignment researching a scientist (played by [[Blair Brown]]) who studies birds of prey in the remote [[Rocky Mountains]].

By 1980, Belushi had become a fan and advocate of the punk rock band [[Fear (band)|Fear]] after seeing them perform in several after-hours New York City bars, and brought them to [[Cherokee Studios]] to record songs for the soundtrack of '' [[Neighbors (1981 film)|Neighbors]].'' Blues Brother band member and sax player [[Tom Scott (musician)|Tom Scott]], along with producing partner and Cherokee owner Bruce Robb, initially helped with the session but later pulled out due to conflicts with Belushi. The session was eventually produced by [[Steve Cropper]].

At the time of his death, Belushi was pursuing several movie projects,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://splitsider.com/2011/03/the-lost-roles-of-john-belushi/|title=The Lost Roles of John Belushi|last1=Evans|first1=Bradford|last2= |first2= |date=March 3, 2011|website=Splitsider|publisher= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; including ''Moon Over Miami'' with [[Louis Malle]], ''National Lampoon's The Joy of Sex'' with [[Penny Marshall]], and ''Noble Rot'' with [[Jay Sandrich]], based on a script he adapted and rewrote with former ''SNL'' writer [[Don Novello]]. He was also scheduled to work with Aykroyd on ''[[Ghostbusters]]'' and ''[[Spies Like Us]]''.

Belushi also made a "Guest Star Appearance" on an episode of the television series ''[[Police Squad!]]'' (1982), which showed him underwater wearing cement shoes. He died shortly before the episode aired, so the scene was cut and replaced by a segment with [[William Conrad]].&lt;ref name="imdb.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000004/bio|title=John Belushi|website=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
The day before Belushi's death, he visited his longtime manager [[Bernie Brillstein]] and asked for cash. Brillstein said no, suspecting Belushi wanted money for drugs.&lt;ref&gt;Bernie Brillstein, Where Did I Go Right? You're No One in Hollywood Unless Someone Wants You Dead (1999, Little, Brown and Company)&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the day, when Brillstein had another visitor, Belushi returned and again asked for money. Brillstein complied, reluctant to rebuke Belushi in front of another person. 

On March 5, 1982, arriving for a scheduled workout, Belushi's trainer [[Bill Wallace (martial arts)|Bill Wallace]] found him dead in Bungalow 3 at the [[Chateau Marmont]] Hotel on [[Sunset Boulevard]] in [[Hollywood]].&lt;ref name= manic&gt;{{cite news |title=John Belushi, Manic Comic of TV and Films Dies. |url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F40611FD3E5F0C758CDDAA0894DA484D81 |quote=John Belushi, the manic, rotund comedian whose outrageous antics and spastic impersonations on the ''Saturday Night Live'' television show propelled him to stardom in the 1970s, was found dead yesterday in a rented bungalow in Hollywood, where he had launched a film career in recent years.

In the early morning hours on the day of his death, he was visited separately by friends [[Robin Williams]] and [[Robert De Niro]], as well as [[Cathy Smith|Catherine Evelyn Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | title= Robin Williams| series= Biography | publisher= Biography Channel | date= July 7, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.franksreelreviews.com/shorttakes/morbid.htm#belushi | title= John Belushi Dies at the Chateau Marmont| website= franksreelreviews.com| date= | accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; His death was investigated by [[forensic pathology|forensic pathologist]] [[Michael Baden]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/19/us/pathologist-cites-heroin-in-death-of-belushi.html|title=PATHOLOGIST CITES HEROIN IN DEATH OF BELUSHI|date=September 19, 1985|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; among others, and, while the findings were disputed, it was officially ruled a drug-related accident. 

Two months later, Smith admitted in an interview with the ''[[National Enquirer]]'' that she had been with Belushi the night of his death and had given him the fatal speedball shot. After the appearance of the article "I Killed Belushi" in the ''Enquirer'' edition of June 29, 1982, the case was reopened. Smith was extradited from [[Ontario]], [[Canada]], arrested, and charged with [[Murder (United States law)#Degrees|first-degree murder]]. A [[plea bargain]] reduced the charge to [[involuntary manslaughter]], and she served 15 months in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/17/us/figure-in-john-belushi-case-freed-from-california-prison.html |title=Figure in John Belushi Case Freed From California Prison|work= The New York Times |date=March 17, 1988 |accessdate=August 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Belushi's wife arranged for a traditional [[Eastern Orthodox|Orthodox Christian]] funeral which was conducted by an [[Albanian Orthodox]] priest.  He has been interred twice at Abel's Hill Cemetery in [[Chilmark, Massachusetts]] on [[Martha's Vineyard]]. A tombstone marking the original burial location has a skull and crossbones with the inscription, "I may be gone but Rock and Roll lives on."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/77 |title=John Belushi (1949–1982) – Find A Grave Memorial |website= Findagrave.com |date= |accessdate=March 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His name is included on the Belushi family stone marking his mother's grave at [[Elmwood Cemetery (River Grove, Illinois)|Elmwood Cemetery]] in [[River Grove, Illinois]]. This stone reads, "He gave us laughter."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first= Judith | last= Belushi Pisano | year= 2007 | title= Belushi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tributes, legacy, and popular culture==
Belushi's life was detailed in the 1984 biography ''[[Wired (book)|Wired: The Short Life and Fast Times of John Belushi]]'' by [[Bob Woodward]] and 1990's ''[[Samurai Widow]]'' by his wife Judith.

The [[thrash metal]] group [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]] penned a song about Belushi on their 1987 album ''[[Among the Living]]'', titled "Efilnikufesin (N.F.L.)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.songfacts.com/blog/interviews/charlie_benante_of_anthrax/|title=Songfacts Interview with Charlie Benante by Greg Prato|last=Prato|first=Prato|publisher=Songfacts.com|accessdate=January 31, 2016 | date=February 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polish rock band [[Lady Pank]] recorded a song "John Belushi" for their 1988 "Tacy sami" album, with references to his [[Albanian American|Albanian]] ancestry.

Belushi has been portrayed by actors Eric Siegel in ''[[Gilda Radner]]: It's Always Something,'' [[Tyler Labine]] in ''Behind the Camera: The Unauthorized Story of [[Mork &amp; Mindy]]'' (which also features his friendship with Robin Williams), [[Michael Chiklis]] in ''[[Wired (film)|Wired]]'' and [[John Gemberling]] in ''[[A Futile and Stupid Gesture]].'' Future ''SNL'' star [[Chris Farley]], whose humor was heavily influenced by Belushi, died in 1997 at age 33 due to a drug overdose, similar to [[combined drug intoxication]], contributing to comparisons between Belushi and Farley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/SHOWBIZ/books/05/07/chris.farley/|title='Chris Farley Show' stuffed with gossip|last=Goldblatt|first=Henry|publisher=CNN.com|accessdate=June 8, 2008 |date=May 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His widow later remarried and is now Judith Belushi Pisano. She and co-biographer Tanner Colby produced ''[[Belushi: A Biography]],'' a collection of first-person interviews and photographs of John Belushi's life that was published in 2005. 

Belushi's career and death were prominently featured in the 1999 memoir of his manager [[Bernie Brillstein]], who wrote that he was haunted by the comedian's overdose and learned how to better deal with clients who abuse drugs or alcohol from handling Belushi.&lt;ref&gt;Brillstein, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Belushi was posthumously inducted into the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] with a [[List of actors with Hollywood Walk of Fame motion picture stars|motion pictures star]] located at 6355 [[Hollywood Boulevard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walkoffame.com/john-belushi |title=Hollywood Walk of Fame – John Belushi |website=walkoffame.com |publisher=Hollywood Chamber of Commerce |accessdate=November 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, [[Biography Channel]] aired an episode of ''[[Final 24]]'', a documentary following Belushi during the last twenty-four hours leading to his death. Four years later, Biography aired a full biography documentation of Belushi's life.

According to his ''SNL'' fellow, [[Jane Curtin]], who appeared on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' in 2011, Belushi was a [[misogynist]] who would deliberately sabotage the work of women writers and comics while working on ''SNL''. "So you'd go to a table read, and if a woman writer had written a piece for John, he would not read it in his full voice. He felt as though it was his duty to sabotage pieces written by women."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/04/13/john-belushi-sexist-jane-curtain_n_848646.html/|title=John Belushi A Misogynist|last=Huffingtonpost|first=Huffingtonpost|publisher=Huffingtonpost|accessdate=June 8, 2008 |date=May 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the pre-production of ''[[Ghostbusters]]'', Ivan Reitman remarked [[Slimer]] was sort of like Bluto in the film ''[[Animal House]]'', like the ghost of John Belushi.&lt;ref&gt;Shay, Don (November 1985). ''Making Ghostbusters'', p. 78 annotation. New York Zoetrope, New York NY USA, {{ISBN|0918432685}}. Joe Medjuck says: "''One day, during preproduction, we were all sitting around talking about the Onionhead concept, and Ivan remarked that the character was sort of like Bluto in Animal House – like the ghost of John Belushi, in a way, Danny, who was obviously a good friend of John's, never argued with that. Even so, we never officially said that and we never mentioned it in the script. It was just one way to look at the character, because Onionhead's grossness is like Bluto's in Animal House. We certainly never expected anyone to recognize him as such, although somehow the word did get out and we received some calls from a few newspapers saying they'd heard we had the ghost of John Belushi in our movie.''"&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, Slimer has been described as "The Ghost of John Belushi" by [[Dan Aykroyd]] in many interviews.

At the conclusion of the very first live [[Saturday Night Live (season 7)|''SNL'' episode]] ([[Robert Urich]]/[[Mink DeVille]] on March 20, 1982) two weeks after Belushi's death, [[Brian Doyle-Murray]] gave a tribute to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://snltranscripts.jt.org/81/81nbelushi.phtml|title=81n: Robert Urich / Mink De Ville|last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=Saturday Night Live Transcripts|publisher= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] Network's similar sketch comedy series [[Fridays (TV series)|''Fridays'']] aired a live episode the night of Belushi's death. Just before the final credits rolled cast member [[Maryedith Burrell]] paid tribute to him by saying, ''"We're all going to miss John Belushi"''.

Belushi was scheduled to present the first annual Best Visual Effects Oscar at the [[54th Academy Awards|1982 Academy Awards]] with Dan Aykroyd. Aykroyd presented the award alone, and stated from the lectern: "My partner would have loved to have been here tonight to present this award, since he was a bit of a Visual Effect himself."&lt;ref name="imdb.com"/&gt;

In 2015, Belushi was ranked by ''Rolling Stone'' as the greatest ''SNL'' cast member of all time.&lt;ref name=RollingStoneSNLRanked&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sheffield|first1=Rob|title='Saturday Night Live': All 141 Cast Members Ranked|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/lists/saturday-night-live-all-141-cast-members-ranked-20150211|accessdate=March 25, 2015|work=Rolling Stone|date=February 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the TV series [[Preacher (TV series)|Preacher]] referenced Belushi as having been assassinated as a [[false prophet]].
