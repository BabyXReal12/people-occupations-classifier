'''Thomas Gordon Poston''' (October 17, 1921 – April 30, 2007) was an American television and film [[actor]]. He starred on [[television]] in a career that began in 1950. He appeared as a comic actor, game show panelist, comedy/variety show host, film actor, television actor, and [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] performer. 

According to ''[[USA Today]]'' Life editor Dennis Moore, Poston appeared in more sitcoms than any other actor.&lt;ref name=moore&gt;{{cite news| title=Which American Actor Appeared in the most TV Sitcoms?| url=https://www.usatoday.com/videos/opinion/2013/08/05/2621327|last=Moore|first=Dennis|date=August 5, 2013|work=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=2014-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s, he played George Utley opposite [[Bob Newhart]]'s character on ''[[Newhart]]''.

==Early life==
Poston was born in [[Columbus, Ohio]], the son of George and Margaret Poston. His father was a liquor salesman and [[dairy]] chemist.&lt;ref name="filmref"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/20/Tom-Poston.html|title=Tom Poston profile|publisher=filmreference.com|accessdate=2014-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After completing high school, Poston attended [[Bethany College (West Virginia)|Bethany College]] in [[West Virginia]], but did not graduate. While there, he joined the [[Sigma Nu]] Fraternity. He joined the [[United States Army Air Forces]] in 1941. Accepted to officer candidate school and then graduating from flight training, Poston served as a pilot in the [[European Theater of World War II|European Theater]] in [[World War II]]; his aircraft dropped paratroopers for the [[invasion of Normandy|Normandy invasion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Astor|first1=Gerald|title=The Greatest War - Volume II: D-Day and the Assault on Europe|date=1999|publisher=Warner Books|location=New York|isbn=044661047X|page=247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Poston served in North Africa, Italy, France, and England. After his discharge, he began studying acting in [[New York City]], graduating from the [[American Academy of Dramatic Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fox|first1=Margalit|title=Tom Poston, Virtuosic Comic Actor, Is Dead at 85|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/02/obituaries/02poston.html?_r=0|accessdate=June 9, 2016|publisher=New York Times|date=May 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In 1953, as Thomas Poston, he was cast as "Detective" in the film ''[[City That Never Sleeps]]''. In 1957, Poston gained recognition as a comedic "Man in the Street" (along with his colleagues [[Louie Nye]], [[Dayton Allen]] and [[Don Knotts]]) on ''[[The Steve Allen Show]]''. For these performances, Poston won the 1959 [[Emmy Award]] for Best Supporting Actor (Continuing Character) in a Comedy Series. In the fall of 1959, when the Allen program moved west to Los Angeles, Tom remained in New York, appearing frequently on Broadway and television game shows. 

His film career was limited, with appearances in films such as [[William Castle]]'s ''[[Zotz!]]'' (1962), ''[[The Old Dark House (1963 film)|The Old Dark House]]'' (1963), ''[[Soldier in the Rain]]'' (1963), ''[[Cold Turkey (film)|Cold Turkey]]'' (1971), ''[[The Happy Hooker (film)|The Happy Hooker]]'' (1975), ''[[Rabbit Test (film)|Rabbit Test]]'' (1978), ''[[Up the Academy]]'' (1980) and ''[[Carbon Copy (film)|Carbon Copy]]'' (1981). 

However, his television career was expansive, covering the better part of five decades. When [[Mel Brooks]] submitted his idea for ''[[Get Smart]]'' to the [[American Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] network, ABC wanted Poston for the lead role of Maxwell Smart.&lt;ref name=parish&gt;{{cite book|page=165|last=Parish|first=James Robert|title=It's Good to Be the King: The Seriously Funny Life of Mel Brooks| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WM8ZEm2KRZoC&amp;q=poston#v=snippet&amp;q=poston&amp;f=false|date=February 28, 2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9780470-225264}}&lt;/ref&gt; When ABC passed on the show, [[NBC]] picked it up and the lead went to [[Don Adams]]. Poston, however, made a guest appearance on the show as a KAOS villain. He appeared in ''[[Thriller (U.S. TV series)|Thriller]]'' during its second season in 1961. The episode, number six, was entitled "Masquerade" and starred [[Elizabeth Montgomery]].

In 1968, Poston played the role of the [[Scarecrow (Oz)|Scarecrow]], at [[The Municipal Opera Association of St. Louis]], production of ''[[The Wizard of Oz (adaptations)|The Wizard of Oz]]''. [[Lana Cantrell]] played [[Dorothy Gale]], and Betty Low played the Sorceress of the North, also known as [[Glinda]].

Poston was a recurring guest star on ''[[The Bob Newhart Show]]'' in the 1970s. He later played the role of Franklin Delano Bickley on ''[[Mork &amp; Mindy]]''. 

A longtime friend of [[Bob Newhart]], Poston played George Utley, a simple country handyman of the Stratford Inn, on ''[[Newhart]]'' and appeared with Newhart in ''[[Cold Turkey (film)|Cold Turkey]]'' as the town drunk, Edgar Stopworth. He was nominated for an Emmy Award three times for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series for his performance on ''[[Newhart]]'' in 1984, 1986, and 1987. He had a third role with Newhart in the short-lived ''[[Bob (TV series)|Bob]]''.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

Poston had regular roles on many other television series: ''[[Family Matters]]'', ''[[Murphy Brown]]'', ''[[Home Improvement (TV series)|Home Improvement]]'', ''[[Cosby]]'', ''[[Malcolm &amp; Eddie]]'', ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'', ''[[Grace Under Fire]]'', ''[[That '70s Show]]'' (as [[Kitty Forman]]'s father, Burt Sigurdson), ''[[Will &amp; Grace]]'', and guest starred in [[Dancin' Homer|an episode]] of ''[[The Simpsons]]'' as the [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Capital City Goofball|Capital City Goofball]]. He played dentist/jeweler, Art Hibke, on ABC's ''[[Coach (TV series)|Coach]]'', for which he was nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series in 1991. He guest-starred on ''Home Improvement'' as a surly airport clerk in [[Alpena, Michigan]] when Tim and Al get stuck there during a snowstorm on Christmas Eve, and again as that character's brother in the episode "The Tool Man Delivers", and again as the third brother in the episode “Thanksgiving”.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

In 2001, he appeared on ''[[The Lone Gunmen (TV series) |The Lone Gunmen]]'' episode "The Cap'n Toby Show"&lt;ref name=imdb&gt;{{cite web| title=Tom Poston| url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0692976/| publisher=IMDb.com| accessdate=2014-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in ''[[King of the Hill]]'' episode "Now Who's The Dummy?" as Mr. Popper (voice). In 2005, he played the character "Clown" on the brief-lived NBC series ''[[Committed (2005 television series)|Committed]]'' and guest-starred on the ABC series ''[[8 Simple Rules]]'' as Rory's unlawful friend Jake in the episode "Good Moms Gone Wild". In 2006, Poston guest-starred on an episode of ''[[The Suite Life of Zack &amp; Cody]]'', entitled "Ah! Wilderness" as Merle, which was his final role.

==Personal life==
Poston and actress [[Jean Sullivan]] were married in 1955 and divorced in 1968. Their daughter is actress Francesca Poston.

Poston married Kay Hudson in 1968. They had two children, daughter Hudson Poston and son Jason Poston. They divorced in 1975 but remarried in 1980 and remained together until her death in 1998 from [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|ALS]].&lt;ref name=bernstein&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/01/AR2007050101336.html| title=Tom Poston; Played the Comically Clueless| work=[[The Washington Post]]| last=Bernstein| first=Adam| date=May 2, 2007| publisher=washingtonpost.com| accessdate=2014-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Poston married actress [[Suzanne Pleshette]], who played the wife of Newhart's character Bob Hartley on ''The Bob Newhart Show'', his fourth marriage, and her third marriage.&lt;ref name=donnelley&gt;{{cite book|title=Fade to Black: A Book of Over 1500 Movie Obituaries|first=Paul|last=Donnelley|date=September 1, 2010|publisher=Omnibus Press|isbn=978-1849382465}}&lt;/ref&gt;
