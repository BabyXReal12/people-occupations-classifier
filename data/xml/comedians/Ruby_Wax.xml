A classically trained actress, Wax starred in the sitcom ''[[Girls on Top (TV series)|Girls on Top]]'' (1985–86), and came to prominence as a comic interviewer, playing up to British perceptions of the strident American style, in shows including ''The Full Wax'' (1991–94) and ''Ruby Wax Meets...'' (1994–98). She was the script editor for the sitcom ''[[Absolutely Fabulous]]'' (1992–2012), also appearing in two episodes. Her memoirs, ''How Do You Want Me?''

[[File:Ruby Wax.jpg|thumb|upright|Wax at the 2007 [[BAFTA]] awards]]

===Early career===

Wax's 2010 stand-up show ''Losing It'' deals with her experience of [[clinical depression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|QI9M4UUFSsY}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show played in London at the [[Duchess Theatre]] in 2011. Wax founded the mental health website (which is now part of the [[SANE (charity)|SANE]] mental health charity) in 2011 in response to the audience reaction from her theatre show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sane.org.uk |title=Home |website=SANE, mental health charity - emotional support, research and campaigning}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2015, Ruby Wax was appointed Visiting Professor in Mental Health Nursing at the [[University of Surrey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.surrey.ac.uk/mediacentre/press/2015/ruby-wax-appointed-visiting-professor-university-surrey |first=Tanya |last=Wood |title=Ruby Wax appointed Visiting Professor at the University of Surrey |website=[[University of Surrey]] |date=24 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other work==
Wax teaches business communication in both the public and private sector. Clients include [[Deutsche Bank]], the UK [[Home Office]] and [[Skype]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/mar/22/ruby-wax-workshops-home-office |location=London |newspaper=The Guardian |title=Comic Ruby Wax runs workshops for Home Office staff |date=22 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2013, Wax graduated from [[Kellogg College]] at [[Oxford University]] with a master's degree in [[Mindfulness (psychology)|mindfulness]] based cognitive therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/news/10678444.Hats_off_to_comic_Ruby/ |title=Hats off to comic Ruby |date=17 September 2013 |newspaper=[[Oxford Mail]] |accessdate=27 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She previously earned a postgraduate certificate in psychotherapy and counselling from [[Regents College]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rubywaxleadership.co.uk/index.php/training-and-education/ |title=Training and Education |website=rubywaxleadership.co.uk |accessdate=27 December 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141228024319/http://rubywaxleadership.co.uk/training-and-education/ |archivedate=28 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==

===Popetown===
In 2004, the BBC planned to show a cartoon series called ''[[Popetown]]'', which poked fun at the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. In it, Wax portrayed the Pope as a spoiled child. After protests, the BBC chose not to show the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/sep/24/bbc.broadcasting?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487 |title=BBC drops controversial Pope cartoon |first=Stephen |last=Bates |newspaper=The Guardian |date=24 September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Slander case===
In February 2004, Irish broadcaster Patricia Danaher reached an out-of-court settlement with Wax, who had falsely claimed that Danaher had made "racist" and "anti-Semitic" remarks about her in an interview for [[Ulster Television]]. Wax's legal team apologised in court, accepted that Danaher had not made any racist or anti-Semitic statements and announced that there had been a financial settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=13 February 2004 |title=Ruby Wax apology over 'racist' claims |journal=[[The Stage]] |url=https://www.thestage.co.uk/news/2004/ruby-wax-apology-over-racist-claims/ |accessdate=16 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opposition to disabled-access ramp===
In November 2005, Wax was criticised by the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' columnist Richard Kay for allegedly opposing a proposed disabled-access ramp for the nearby{{clarify|date=June 2015}} [[Couper Collection]] charitable art gallery. The UK Sunday newspaper ''[[The Observer]]'' also reported the controversy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,6903,1664656,00.html |title=It's Wax versus Max in battle of the art barges |first=Alice |last=O'Keeffe |date=11 December 2005 |newspaper=[[The Observer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; as did [[I, Ludicrous]] in "The Ruby Wax Song" from their ''Dirty Washing'' 2008 EP. In 2006, Wax responded to the claims in the London ''[[Evening Standard]]'': "Oh no, that's not true. That's so off the wall. Why would I object to a disabled ramp? It wasn't even about that."&lt;ref name="LEStandard"/&gt;

==Personal life==
Wax is married to television producer and director [[Ed Bye]]. They have three children: Max (born 1988), Madeleine (born 1990), and Marina (born 1993).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/how-we-met-ruby-wax-and-ed-bye-1455941.html |title=How we met: Ruby Wax and Ed Bye |first=Melanie |last=McFadyean |date=17 April 1993 |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |accessdate=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wax has been very open about her own [[major depressive disorder|depression]]. She made an online series on mental health issues for the BBC and has worked with mental health charities. This was recognised in 2015, when she received an OBE in the [[2015 Special Honours|Special Honours]] for Services to Mental Health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/509363/2015_Honorary_Awards_-_Final.pdf |title=Honorary Awards |date=2015 |website=Gov.UK |accessdate=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an episode of the BBC's ''[[Who Do You Think You Are? (UK TV series)|Who Do You Think You Are?]]'' in 2017, Wax revealed that her great-grandmother and great-aunt had been committed to mental asylums in Brno and Vienna as they were incurably "agitated".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whodoyouthinkyouaremagazine.com/wdytya-episode-summary-ruby-wax |title=WDYTYA? episode summary: Ruby Wax |date=4 October 2017 |website=Who Do You Think You Are? |publisher=Immediate Media Company |accessdate=7 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
