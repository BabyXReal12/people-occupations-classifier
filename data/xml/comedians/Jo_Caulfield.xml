'''Josephine Caulfield''' (born 26 September 1965) is a British actress, writer and comedian.

==Biography==
Born in [[Wales]] to Irish parents, she was brought up in [[Derbyshire]] and Leicestershire, England.

At 17, Caulfield moved to London. For two years she lived in a squat in Ladbroke Grove, West London, and played drums in a [[rockabilly]] band. Heavily influenced by [[The Cramps]] and The Fleshtones the band went nowhere fast due to their "lack of songs, musical ability and talent. But we did wear nice clothes" (Jo Caulfield, Radio 4 interview).

===Career===
Deciding she wanted to get into comedy, Caulfield worked as a [[waitress]] during the day, saved up her tips, bought a small microphone and amplifier, and opened her own comedy club. After meeting her partner, the couple agreed a two-year plan to either make it or give up. Caulfield was soon writing for [[Graham Norton]], getting her own gigs and doing a [[BBC Radio 4]] show.

===Writer/comedian===
In 2010, Jo Caulfield was nominated as 'Funniest Woman 2010' (LAFTA Awards). She has previously been nominated as 'Best Female Comedian 2002' ([[Chortle Awards]]), 'Best Compere 2004' (Chortle Awards) and one of 'The 100 Greatest Stand-Ups' ([[Channel 4]]).

She has appeared at major comedy clubs, both in the UK and overseas, and has completed two solo nationwide tours, and a further three as support act of Graham Norton, [[Puppetry of the Penis]] and [[Rory Bremner]]. For the last nine years, Caulfield has taken a new solo comedy show to the [[Edinburgh Fringe]].

Caulfield was Comedy Writer/Programme Consultant for all five series of the [[BAFTA]] Award-winning ''[[So Graham Norton]]''. She was also head writer on both [[Ruby Wax]]'s ''Waiting Game'' and Zoe Ball's 'Strictly Dance Fever' (BBC3). Caulfield has also written for Joan Rivers, Anne Robinson, Denise Van Outen and Ant &amp; Dec among others.

Caulfield's first CD, "Thinking Bad Thoughts", was released via iTunes in October 2012.

She currently hosts a regular spoken word/comedy evening at the [[Scottish Storytelling Centre]] in Edinburgh called ''The Speakeasy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edinburgh.stv.tv/56652/ |title=Jo Caulfield's Speakeasy returns to Scottish Storytelling Centre |date=10 January 2014 |publisher=[[STV (TV channel)|STV]] |accessdate=10 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most recently, she appeared on ''[[Michael McIntyre's Comedy Roadshow]]''.
 
In November 2008 Caulfield presented a video piece for BBC1's ''[[The One Show]]'' about [[Charles Darwin]]. Caulfield visited the Darwin exhibition at the [[Natural History Museum]] to see what Darwin thought were the pros and cons of marriage.

In March 2010 Caulfield had her set at London's Comedy Store filmed for the up-and-coming ''The Comedy Store'' series on ''Comedy Central''.

In April 2010 Caulfield presented a piece for BBC1's ''[[The Politics Show]]''. Filmed at the Harrogate Theatre during her 'Won't Shut Up' tour Caulfield canvassed the audience about their views on politics, politicians and the 2010 election campaign.

She is also a TV warm-up artist, and is the regular warm-up for ''[[Have I Got News for You]]'' (with two appearances as a contestant). Other TV shows she regularly worked on include ''[[V Graham Norton]]'', ''[[Alistair McGowan's Big Impression]]'', ''[[Bremner, Bird and Fortune]]'', ''[[Gimme Gimme Gimme (TV series)|Gimme Gimme Gimme]]'', ''[[Two Pints of Lager and a Packet of Crisps]]'', and ''[[Perfect World (sitcom)|Perfect World]]''.

Acting credits include ''[[Family Affairs]]'', ''[[Days Like These]]'', ''[[Beast (Sitcom)|Beast]]'', and ''[[Get Real (UK TV series)|Get Real]]''.

===Radio===
She has been a regular guest on many radio shows: ''[[It's Been a Bad Week]]'', ''The Fred MacAulay Show'', ''The Motion Show'', ''[[Parsons and Naylor's Pull-Out Section]]'', ''[[Quote... Unquote]]'', ''The Sunday Programme'' (LBC Radio), ''[[The Now Show]]'' and ''[[Twenty Twenty]]''.
