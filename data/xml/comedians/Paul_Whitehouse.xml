'''Paul Julian Whitehouse'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.checksure.biz/Director/PAUL+JULIAN+WHITEHOUSE-16591493.htm |title=Paul Julian Whitehouse |publisher=Checksure.biz |date= |accessdate=2015-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; (born 17 May 1958) is a British actor, writer and comedian. He became known for his work with [[Harry Enfield]] and as one of the stars of the popular [[BBC]] sketch comedy series ''[[The Fast Show]]''. In a 2005 poll to find The Comedian's Comedian, he was in the top 50 comedy acts voted for by comedians and comedy insiders. He is best known for his comic characters in ''The Fast Show'', ''[[Harry &amp; Paul]]'' and ''[[Harry Enfield and Chums]]''.

== Early life ==
Paul Julian Whitehouse was born on 17 May 1958, in [[Stanleytown, Rhondda Cynon Taf|Stanleytown]], [[Glamorgan]], Wales.&lt;ref name="WoS1"&gt;[http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/comic-paul-tells-talent-change-2227829 Comic Paul tells of talent change] Wales on Sunday – 28 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; His father worked for the [[National Coal Board]] and his mother was a singer with the [[Welsh National Opera]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/southeast/halloffame/showbiz/paul_whitehouse.shtml |title=South East Wales Showbiz – Paul Whitehouse |publisher=BBC |date=27 April 2009 |accessdate=25 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family moved to [[London Borough of Enfield|Enfield]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/osm/story/0,,447049,00.html |title=My team. Paul Whitehouse on Tottenham Hotspur|publisher=Guardian media|date=4 March 2001 |accessdate=2 March 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; in north London, England when he was four years old, which led to his discovering his talent for [[mimicry]]:&lt;ref name="WoS1" /&gt;
{{quote|At school I didn't say a word for the first four weeks – I called it my Silent Month. I think it was because everyone was speaking so differently from how it had been in Wales. Then, after four weeks, I came home one day and said, 'Muumm, I wanna go to Sarfend!' For her that was the end because I had lost my lovely Welsh lilt. So I became very conscious of speech and the effects it can have. But when I went back to Wales I would start talking all Welsh, 'lyke that you see' before going all [[Alf Garnett]] while coming back the other way.}}

== Career ==
Whitehouse attended the [[University of East Anglia]] from autumn 1976, where he made friends with [[Charlie Higson]].&lt;ref name="BBCBio1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/profiles/paul_whitehouse.shtml |title=Comedy – Paul Whitehouse Profile |publisher=BBC |date=2014-10-28 |accessdate=2015-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pair spent little of their first year studying, instead playing sitar and performing with their [[jazz fusion]] combo, the Right Hand Lovers, along with other university friends Duncan Beamont, Kevin Buckland and [[David Cummings (musician)|Dave Cummings]].

Whitehouse dropped out and lived with other drop-outs in a council flat in [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]], east London and occasionally worked as a [[plasterer]]. After Higson graduated in 1980, he moved in with Whitehouse, working by day as a [[Painter and decorator|decorator]] and performing at night and the weekends with his new [[punk folk|punk-funk]] group ''[[The Higsons]].''&lt;ref name="Times1"&gt;[http://driving.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/driving/features/article2975305.ece On the move: Paul Whitehouse and Charlie Higson] The Times – 2 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The pair began working as tradesmen on a house shared by comedians [[Stephen Fry]] and [[Hugh Laurie]], which inspired them to start writing comedy. They moved to an estate where in a pub they met [[Harry Enfield]], a neighbour with a stage act,&lt;ref name="Times1" /&gt; and after he gained a place on [[Channel 4]]'s ''[[Saturday Live (UK TV series)|Saturday Live]]'', the pair were invited to write for him.&lt;ref name="BBCBio1" /&gt; Whitehouse created Enfield's character ''Stavros'' a London-based Greek [[kebab shop]] owner, and then ''[[Loadsamoney]]'' an archetypal Essex boy made good in [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s 1980s; he also appeared as Enfield's sidekick Lance on ''Saturday Live.''

This success turned Whitehouse and Higson's career, and they began to appear on shows such as ''[[Vic Reeves]]' Big Night Out'' and extensively for the [[BBC]], with Whitehouse appearing on ''[[A Bit of Fry and Laurie]]'' as a man with a clinical need to have his bottom fondled, and ''[[Paul Merton: The Series]]'', then as performer on shows such as ''[[Harry Enfield's Television Programme]]'', where he developed numerous characters including DJ Mike Smash of [[Smashie and Nicey]] alongside [[Harry Enfield]] as Nicey.

=== TV career ===
While watching a preview tape of highlights from Enfield's programme, Whitehouse and Higson were inspired to create a rapid-fire delivery comedy series, which would evolve into ''The Fast Show'' (when shown in the United States on [[BBC America]], the show was titled ''Brilliant''). Whitehouse's characters included:
* [[Rowley Birkin]] QC
* [[The 13th Duke of Wymbourne]]
* Archie ("hardest game in the world")
* Chris Jackson
* [[Unlucky Alf]]
* [[Arthur Atkinson (character)|Arthur Atkinson]]
* Brilliant Kid
* [[Ron Manager]]
* Ken, one of the "Suit You" tailors
* Lindsey, one of the Rubbish Offroaders
* Poutremos Poutra-Poutremos, anchor of the foreign TV station [[Chanel 9]] sketch
* Ted

An online series of ''The Fast Show'' commissioned by Fosters led to six weekly episodes launched on 10 November 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20111105230039/http://fosters.co.uk/tagged/The_Fast_Show] &lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 and 2002, Whitehouse wrote and performed in two series of the BBC comedy drama ''[[Happiness (TV series)|Happiness]]'', in which he played a voice-over actor with a [[mid-life crisis]].

Whitehouse wrote, produced and appeared with [[Chris Langham]] in the 2005 comedy drama ''[[Help (UK TV series)|Help]]'', also for the BBC. In this series he took 25 roles, all patients of Langham's [[psychotherapist]] (except one, who is Langham's psychotherapist's psychotherapist). The pair's collaboration resulted in Whitehouse taking the witness stand on 24 July 2007 in the trial of Langham, in regard to the charge of holding explicit images and videos of minors. Langham claimed he downloaded this material as research for a character in the second series of ''Help'', but Whitehouse's testimony only partially corroborated this explanation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/kent/6913530.stm |title=England &amp;#124; Kent &amp;#124; Co-star 'did not know about porn' |publisher=BBC News |date=24 July 2007 |accessdate=25 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whitehouse appeared in the BBC sketch series ''[[Harry &amp; Paul]]'' (formerly ''Ruddy Hell! It's Harry and Paul''), starring alongside Harry Enfield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/harryandpaul/ |title=Comedy – Harry and Paul – Homepage |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=25 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whitehouse starred alongside Charlie Higson in the [[BBC2]] comedy series ''[[Bellamy's People]]'', with the first episode broadcast on 21 January 2010. The comedy evolved from the [[BBC Radio 4]] program ''[[Down the Line (radio series)|Down the Line]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8461106.stm | work=BBC News | title=Ray to star in Bellamy's People | date=15 January 2010 | accessdate=22 May 2010 | first=Mandeep | last=Sanghera}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show originally had the working title of ''Bellamy's Kingdom''.

In October 2014, Harry Enfield and Whitehouse returned to the characters of Frank and George in a sketch for [[Channel 4]]'s testicular cancer awareness comedy series ''[[The Feeling Nuts Comedy Night]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Freeth |first=Becky |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2807416/Men-Behaving-Badly-s-Martin-Clunes-Neil-Morrissey-reunite-one-skit-15-years.html |title=Men Behaving Badly's Martin Clunes and Neil Morrissey reunite for Feeling Nuts &amp;#124; Daily Mail Online |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date=2014-10-25 |accessdate=2015-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, his sitcom ''[[Nurse (BBC TV Show)|Nurse]]'', based on his Radio 4 series of the same name [[Paul Whitehouse#Radio|(see below)]], debuted on BBC2 on 10 March.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/tv-and-radio-reviews/11461522/Nurse-review.html|title = Nurse, review: 'a beautiful bedside manner'|last = Hogan|first = Michael|date = 10 March 2015|work = [[The Daily Telegraph]]|access-date = 3 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2015, Whitehouse, alongside Enfield, in celebration of their 25-year partnership, presented ''An Evening With Harry Enfield and Paul Whitehouse''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b068zpdh|title=BBC Two – An Evening with Harry Enfield and Paul Whitehouse|work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June and July 2018 Whitehouse appeared with his long time friend and fellow comedian [[Bob Mortimer]] in a BBC2 six part comedy series, ''Mortimer and Whitehouse: Gone Fishing''.  The two friends, who both suffer from heart conditions, share their thoughts and experiences while fishing at a variety of locations around the UK. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0b7r2k6|title= Mortimer &amp; Whitehouse: Gone Fishing|work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Radio ===
Whitehouse and Charlie Higson produced and appeared in a spoof phone-in show ''[[Down the Line (radio series)|Down the Line]]'' on BBC Radio 4. The first series was broadcast May–June 2006. A second series was broadcast 16 January–20 February 2007, during which they won a [[Sony Radio Academy Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.independent.co.uk/media/article3013244.ece |title=The Independent &amp;#124; 404 |publisher=News.independent.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-08-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224225009/http://news.independent.co.uk/media/article3013244.ece |archivedate=24 December 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A third series was broadcast in January 2008, a fourth in January 2011 and a fifth in May 2013. In February 2014, Radio 4 broadcast ''Nurse'', written by Whitehouse and [[David Cummings (musician)|David Cummings]] and starring Esther Coles in the title role, with Whitehouse playing a variety of characters, including Graham Downs who had previously appeared in ''Down the Line''.

=== Other ===
He also starred alongside [[Eddie Large]] and [[Russ Abbot]] in episode 4 of ''[[Horne &amp; Corden]]''. [[Comic Relief]] 2011 contained a new parody video of [[Newport (Ymerodraeth State of Mind)]] directed by MJ Delaney featuring Whitehouse and other Welsh celebrities lip-syncing to the song.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/clips/p00frqrj/comic_relief_comic_reliefs_newport_state_of_mind/]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815041947/http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/clips/p00frqrj/comic_relief_comic_reliefs_newport_state_of_mind/ |date=15 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is available to download via [[iTunes]].

[[Johnny Depp]] described Whitehouse as "the greatest actor of all time".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/3583167/That-was-a-joke-I-made.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Amanda | last=Mitchison | title=That was a joke I made | date=27 September 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whitehouse and John Sullivan’s son, [[Jim Sullivan (writer)|Jim Sullivan]], have written an ''[[Only Fools and Horses]]'' musical, due to launch in early 2019.&lt;ref&gt;http://shazamproductions.co.uk/a-message-from-jim-sullivan/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Whitehouse lives in [[Islington]] and is a supporter of [[association football|football]] team [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/paul-whitehouse-sing-when-youre-winning|title=Paul Whitehouse: Sing When You're Winning |publisher=FourFourTwo |date=1 February 2000 |accessdate=29 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=261350282&amp;s=143444&amp;i=19613319 |title=iTunes Store |publisher=Phobos.apple.com |date= |accessdate=25 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Influences ===
Whitehouse's main early influences were the sketches of [[Les Dennis]] and [[Dustin Gee]] and [[The Goodies]]. [[Tommy Cooper]] made him laugh, as did [[Morecambe and Wise]] and the television show ''[[Dad's Army]].'' He cites his modern influences as [[Harry Enfield]], of whom he says without meeting he would not have been doing what he does now, and the approach of [[Reeves and Mortimer]] who he thinks are "far and away the best comedians that we have had in this country for a long while."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/talking_point/forum/1225156.stm |title=FORUM &amp;#124; Comedian Paul Whitehouse quizzed |publisher=BBC News |date=2001-03-19 |accessdate=2015-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
