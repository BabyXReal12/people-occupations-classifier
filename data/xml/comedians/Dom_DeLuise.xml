'''Dominick DeLuise''' (August 1, 1933 – May 4, 2009) was an American actor, voice actor, comedian, chef and author. He was the husband of actress [[Carol Arthur]] and the father of actor, director, pianist, and writer [[Peter DeLuise]], and actors [[David DeLuise]] and [[Michael DeLuise]].&lt;ref name=filmref /&gt; He starred in a number of movies directed by [[Mel Brooks]], in a series of films with career-long best friend [[Burt Reynolds]], and as a voice actor in various animated films by [[Don Bluth]].

==Early life==
DeLuise was born in Brooklyn, New York, to [[Italian American]] parents Vincenza "Jennie" ([[married and maiden names|née]] DeStefano), a homemaker, and John DeLuise, a public employee (garbage collector). He was the youngest of three children, having an older brother, Nicholas "Nick" DeLuise, and an older sister, Antoinette DeLuise-Daurio.&lt;ref name="filmref"&gt;{{cite web| title=Dom Deluise Biography (1933- )| url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/57/Dom-Deluise.html| date=| publisher=filmreference.com| accessdate=May 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  DeLuise graduated from Manhattan's [[High School of Performing Arts]] and later attended [[Tufts University]] in [[Medford, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name="TimesBio"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://movies.nytimes.com/person/87126/Dom-DeLuise/biography| work=New York Times| publisher=NYTimes.com| title=Dom DeLuise Biography| date=| accessdate=May 18, 2011| author=Nathan Southern}}&lt;/ref&gt; DeLuise was [[Roman Catholic]] and had a particular devotion to the [[Virgin Mary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccc.usccb.org/video/one2one/deluise_dom.asf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=November 20, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706124036/http://ccc.usccb.org/video/one2one/deluise_dom.asf |archivedate=July 6, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In 1961 DeLuise played in the Off-Broadway musical revue "Another Evening with Harry Stoons" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Barbra Archives|url=http://barbra-archives.com/live/60s/harry_stoones_streisand.html|accessdate=February 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; that lasted nine previews and one performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Streisand|first=Barbra|title=Value|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt-Sy6T3Y20|work=Live at the Bon Soir (1962)|accessdate=February 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another member of the cast was 19-year-old [[Barbra Streisand]].  He was also in the Off-Broadway play "all in Love" which opened on November 10, 1961, at the Martinique Theatre and ran for 141 performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/shows/cast.php?showid=3132#content|title=All in Love Original Off-Broadway Cast - 1961 Off-Broadway|website=www.broadwayworld.com|access-date=November 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other New York theater performances include, "Half-Past Wednesday" [Off-Broadway] (1962), "Around the World in 80 Days" [Off-Broadway] (1963), "The Student Gypsy" [Broadway] (1963), "Here's Love" [Broadway] (1963), and "Last of the Red Hot Lovers" [Broadway] (1969).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/people/Dom-De-Luise/|title=Dom DeLuise Theatre Credits|website=www.broadwayworld.com|access-date=November 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DeLuise generally appeared in comedic parts, although an early appearance in the movie ''[[Fail-Safe (1964 film)|Fail-Safe]]'' as a nervous [[USAF]] [[technical sergeant]] showed a broader range. His first acting credit was as a regular performer in the television show ''[[The Entertainers]]'' in 1964. He gained early notice for his supporting turn in the [[Doris Day]] film ''[[The Glass Bottom Boat]]'' (1966). In his ''[[New York Times]]'' review, [[Vincent Canby]] panned the film but singled out the actor, stating, "[T]he best of the lot, however, is a newcomer, Dom DeLuise, as a portly, bird-brained spy."&lt;ref name="canby"&gt;{{cite news| title=Movie Review: The Glass Bottom Boat (1966)| author=Vincent Canby| date=June 10, 1966| work=New York Times| publisher=NYTimes.com| url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E01E7DD133DE43BBC4852DFB066838D679EDE| accessdate=May 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s and 1980s, he often co-starred with [[Burt Reynolds]]. Together they appeared in the films ''[[The Cannonball Run (film)|The Cannonball Run]]'' and ''[[Cannonball Run II]]'', ''[[Smokey and the Bandit II]]'', ''[[The End (1978 film)|The End]]'', ''[[All Dogs Go to Heaven]]'' and ''[[The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas (film)|The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas]]''. DeLuise was the [[:wikt:host|host]] of the television show ''[[Candid Camera]]'' from 1991-92.

DeLuise also lent his distinct voice to various [[animation|animated films]] and was a particular staple of [[Don Bluth]]'s features, playing major roles in ''[[The Secret of NIMH]]'', ''[[An American Tail]]'', ''[[A Troll in Central Park]]'' and ''[[All Dogs Go to Heaven]]''.  ''All Dogs Go to Heaven'' also featured Reynolds' voice as Charlie B. Barkin, the cheeky [[Antihero|anti-hero]], and DeLuise voiced Itchy Itchiford, Charlie's best friend, wing-man and later partner in business. Unlike DeLuise, however, Reynolds did not voice Charlie in any of the eventual film sequels, TV episodes, TV-episode sequels, or TV series. DeLuise also voiced the legendary character of [[Charles Dickens]]' Fagin in the [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney]] film ''[[Oliver &amp; Company]]'' and made voice guest appearances on several animated TV series.[[File:Dom deluise handprint.JPG|thumb|right|The handprints of Dom DeLuise in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]]]]

TV producer [[Greg Garrison]] hired DeLuise to appear as a specialty act on ''[[The Dean Martin Show]]''. DeLuise ran through his "Dominick the Great" routine, a riotous example of a magic act gone wrong, with host Martin as a bemused volunteer from the audience. Dom's catch phrase, with an Italian accent, was "''No Applause Please, Save-a to the End.''" The show went so well that DeLuise was soon a regular on Martin's program, participating in both songs and sketches. Garrison also featured DeLuise in his own hour-long comedy specials for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. (Martin was often just off-camera when these were taped, and his distinctive laugh can be heard loud and clear.) In 1968 he hosted his own hour-long comedy variety series for CBS, The Dom DeLuise Show. Taped in Miami at The [[Jackie Gleason]] Theater it featured many regular Gleason show cast members including The [[June Taylor]] Dancers and The Sammy Spear Orchestra. Dom's wife Carol Arthur also regularly appeared. The 16-week run was the summer replacement for The [[Jonathan Winters]] Show. He later starred in his own [[sitcom]], ''[[Lotsa Luck]]'', which only lasted for 1973-1974 season.

DeLuise was probably best known as a regular in [[Mel Brooks]]' films. He appeared in ''[[The Twelve Chairs (1970 film)|The Twelve Chairs]]'', ''[[Blazing Saddles]]'', ''[[Silent Movie]]'', ''[[History of the World, Part I]]'', ''[[Spaceballs]]'', and ''[[Robin Hood: Men in Tights]]''. Brooks' late wife, actress [[Anne Bancroft]], directed Dom in ''[[Fatso (1980 film)|Fatso]]'' (1980).&lt;ref name="horror"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/36304/horror-oscars-part-2-this-time-it%E2%80%99s-personal| title=Horror at the Oscars Part 2: This Time it’s Personal| date=March 9, 2010| author=Heather Buckley| publisher=Dreadcentral.com| accessdate=May 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also had a [[Cameo appearance|cameo]] in ''[[Johnny Dangerously]]'' as the [[Pope]] and in [[Jim Henson]]'s ''[[The Muppet Movie]]'' as a wayward [[Hollywood]] talent agent who comes across [[Kermit the Frog]] singing "[[The Rainbow Connection]]" in the film's opening scene. He also appeared with fellow Brooks regulars [[Gene Wilder]] (who directed the film as well), [[Marty Feldman]], and [[Madeline Kahn]] in ''[[The Adventure of Sherlock Holmes' Smarter Brother]]'', as well as alongside Wilder and [[Gilda Radner]] in a later Gene Wilder-directed film, ''[[Haunted Honeymoon]]''. He also appeared in ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'' as Urgo.

DeLuise exhibited his comedic talents while playing the speaking part of the jailer Frosch in the comedic [[operetta]] ''[[Die Fledermaus]]'' at the [[Metropolitan Opera]], playing the role in four separate revivals of the work at the Met between December 1989 and January 1996. In the production, while the singing was in German, the spoken parts were in English. A lifelong opera fan, he also portrayed the role of L'Opinion Publique in drag for the [[Los Angeles Opera]]'s production of [[Jacques Offenbach|Offenbach]]'s ''[[Orpheus in the Underworld]]''.&lt;ref name="opera"&gt;{{cite news| date= July 2009 |volume=74 |issue=1| accessdate=June 20, 2009| url=http://www.operanews.com/operanews/templates/content.aspx?id=2299| title=Obituaries: Actors Dom DeLuise and Beatrice Arthur; mezzo Margreta Elkins; soprano Anne Brown, Gershwin's original Bess; composer Lukas Foss dies at eighty-six. |work=[[Opera News]]| author=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An avid cook and author of several books on cooking, he appeared as a regular contributor to a syndicated [[home improvement]] radio show, ''On The House with The Carey Brothers'', giving listeners tips on culinary topics.&lt;ref name="house"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.onthehouse.com/sections/features/dom| title=In The Kitchen with Dom DeLuise| publisher=OnTheHouse.com| date=| accessdate=May 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a friend and self-proclaimed "look-alike" of famous Cajun chef [[Paul Prudhomme]] and author of seven children's books.

==Personal life==
In 1964, while working in summer theater in [[Provincetown, Massachusetts]], DeLuise met his wife, actress [[Carol Arthur]], they married in 1965;&lt;ref name="LATimes"&gt;{{cite news|first=Dennis|last=McLellan|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/la-me-dom-deluise6-2009may06,0,6461527.story| title=Dom DeLuise dies at 75; actor was a 'naturally funny man'| work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tronc]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date=May 6, 2009|accessdate=May 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes1"&gt;{{cite web|first=William|last=Grimes |url=https://nytimes.com/2009/05/07/movies/07deluise.html |title=Dom DeLuise, Comic Actor, Dies at 75 |work=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=New York Times Company|location=New York City|date=May 5, 2009 |accessdate=June 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; together they had three sons, [[Peter DeLuise|Peter]], [[Michael DeLuise|Michael]] and [[David DeLuise]] who are also actors.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt;

==Death==
{{wikinews|American comedic actor Dom DeLuise dies at age 75}}
DeLuise died on May 4, 2009, at [[Saint John's Health Center]] in Santa Monica, California.&lt;ref name="nytimes1" /&gt; He was hospitalized at the time, suffering from [[kidney failure]] and respiratory problems due to complications from [[diabetes]] and [[high blood pressure]]. He suffered from [[cancer]] for more than a year prior to his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Dom DeLuise dies at 75| publisher=CNN| date=June 6, 2011| url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/Movies/05/05/obit.deluise/index.html| accessdate=May 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His family was by his side at the time of his death. His good friend [[Burt Reynolds]] made a statement to the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', saying: "As you get older and start to lose people you love, you think about it more, and I was dreading this moment. Dom always made you feel better when he was around, and there will never be another like him."&lt;ref name="msnbc"&gt;{{cite news| title=Actor, Dom DeLuise dies at 75| url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/30581493/|publisher=[[MSNBC]]/[[Associated Press]]| date=May 5, 2009| accessdate=May 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mel Brooks also made a statement to the same paper, telling them that DeLuise "created so much joy and laughter on the set that you couldn’t get your work done. So every time I made a movie with Dom, I would plan another two days on the schedule just for laughter. It's a sad day. It's hard to think of this life and this world without him."&lt;ref name="LATimes"/&gt;
