===Live performances===
In 1995, Scheer became a member of New York City's longest running Off-Broadway comedy show, ''[[Chicago City Limits]]''. As a member of their touring company, Scheer extensively traveled throughout the United States as well as overseas.

In 1998, he joined the [[Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre]] in New York City where he performed Sketch and Improvisation with [[Respecto Montalban]], winners of the 2003 ECNY Award for "Best Improv Show".
