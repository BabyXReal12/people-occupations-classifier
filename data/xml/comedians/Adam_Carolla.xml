==Early life==
Adam Carolla was born in [[Los Angeles County]], California.&lt;ref name=birthindex /&gt; His mother's maiden name was McCall.&lt;ref name=birthindex /&gt; His parents separated when Adam was young.&lt;ref name=In50Years&gt;{{cite book |last1=Carolla |first1=Adam |authorlink1=Adam Carolla |title=In Fifty Years We'll All Be Chicks: and Other Complaints from an Angry Middle-aged White Guy |url=https://books.google.com/?id=xMys1f3Lno4C |accessdate=March 21, 2012 |edition=1st paperback |date=May 17, 2011 |publisher=[[Three Rivers Press]] |isbn=978-0-307-71738-2 |page=2 |chapter=A Little Bit About the Author |quote=I grew up in Los Angeles's San Fernando Valley in the seventies. I was the product of separation. I would have been the product of divorce but divorce includes filling out paperwork and paying a county clerk sixty bucks to file it. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Carolla was not given a middle name by his parents; on his driver's license application he listed his middle name as "Lakers" as a joke. The application was processed without notice.&lt;ref name="Hoppes"&gt;{{cite news |title=You won't believe Adam Carolla's middle name |last=Hoppes |first=Lynn |publisher=[[ESPN]] |date=June 17, 2010 |url=http://espn.go.com/espn/page2/index?id=5292700 |accessdate=March 15, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66BsTzSay?url=http://espn.go.com/espn/page2/index?id=5292700 |archivedate=March 15, 2012 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="adamradio"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://adamradio.wordpress.com/2006/02/16/adam-with-mark-burnett-rick-fox-finesse-mitchell/ |title=Adam with Mark Burnett, Rick Fox, Finesse Mitchell |date=February 16, 2006 |accessdate=August 10, 2008 |work=The Official Adam Carolla Show Blog |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66Bt6WcA4?url=https://adamradio.wordpress.com/2006/02/16/adam-with-mark-burnett-rick-fox-finesse-mitchell/ |archivedate=March 15, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; His maternal step-grandfather was screenwriter [[László Görög (writer)|László Görög]], who wrote ''[[The Mole People (film)|The Mole People]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lamag.com/features/2007/10/01/inside-the-revved-up-pissed-off-brain-of-adam1 |title=Features – Los Angeles magazine |publisher=Lamag.com |date=March 16, 2013 |accessdate=February 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adam was raised in the [[North Hollywood, Los Angeles|North Hollywood]] neighborhood of Los Angeles. He attended Colfax Elementary School, [[Walter Reed Middle School|Walter Reed Junior High]], and [[North Hollywood High School]]. Carolla did not receive his high school diploma until years later as it was held by the school until a library fine was paid.&lt;ref name="2003-04-01"&gt;{{cite episode | title = April 1, 2003 | series = Loveline | serieslink = Loveline | airdate = April 1, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Carolla can be seen paying off the book and receiving his diploma in an episode of his 2005 television show, ''The Adam Carolla Project''.&lt;ref name=TACP_episode8&gt;{{cite web |title=Nail in the Head (episode 8) |url=http://www.tv.com/shows/the-adam-carolla-project/nail-in-the-head-554041/ |publisher=[[TV.com]] |accessdate=March 15, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66BvBr0fI?url=http://www.tv.com/shows/the-adam-carolla-project/nail-in-the-head-554041/ |archivedate=March 15, 2012 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his earlier years, Carolla played [[Pop Warner Little Scholars|Pop Warner]] [[American football|football]] for seven years; he later suggested that being involved in sports saved him from a chaotic home life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://adamradio.wordpress.com/2006/10/11/adam-with-kurt-busch-shawn-merriman-and-mistress-melissa/ | title=Adam with Kurt Busch, Shawn Merriman and Mistress Melissa | date=October 11, 2006 | work=The Official Adam Carolla Show Blog | archivedate=February 20, 2007 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070220082736/http://adamradio.wordpress.com/2006/10/11/adam-with-kurt-busch-shawn-merriman-and-mistress-melissa/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; During his senior year at North Hollywood High School, Carolla distinguished himself in football. In December 1981, he was named to the First Team Offensive Line, Central Valley League, one of 8 leagues at the time in the LA City Section of the California Interscholastic Federation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/HELMS/Football/CIFFOOTBALL1981.PDF |title=California Interscholastic Federation Football 2011 |format=PDF |accessdate=October 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He began living on his own at the age of 18. He briefly attended [[Los Angeles Valley College]], a [[community college]], where he was placed on academic probation before dropping out to work in a series of jobs, including carpet cleaner,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allamericanspeakers.com/newspeakerbio/2358/index.php |title=Biography of Adam Carolla |accessdate=August 10, 2008 |work=All American Speakers |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090217232511/http://www.allamericanspeakers.com/newspeakerbio/2358/index.php |archivedate=February 17, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; carpenter, [[boxing]] instructor,&lt;ref name="bankrate.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bankrate.com/brm/news/investing/20060103c1.asp|title=Fame &amp; Fortune: Comedian Adam Carolla| date=January 3, 2006 |accessdate=February 20, 2008| last=Getlin| first=Larry| publisher=bankrate.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[traffic school]] instructor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004805/bio |title=Biography for Adam Carolla |accessdate=August 10, 2008 |publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although broke, Carolla, his friends, and roommates owned a 1963 [[Cadillac]] [[limousine]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[CarCast]]'' episode 241: Pebble Beach auctions&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1990s, Carolla studied [[improvisational comedy]] with [[The Groundlings]] and was a member of the [[ACME Comedy Theatre]] troupe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carolla|first1=Adam|title=In Fifty Years We'll All Be Chicks: and Other Complaints from an Angry Middle-aged White Guy|date=May 17, 2011|publisher=Three Rivers Press|isbn=978-0-307-71738-2|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Radio==
In 1994, Carolla volunteered his services as a boxing trainer to prepare [[Jimmy Kimmel]] for a bout being staged by [[KROQ-FM]]'s morning radio program ''[[Kevin and Bean]]''.&lt;ref name="IMDB bio"&gt;{{cite web |title=Adam Carolla (bio) |url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004805/bio |publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]] |accessdate=March 14, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66A5EBmWi?url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004805/bio |archivedate=March 14, 2012 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kimmel was a regular on the show as "Jimmy the Sports Guy" and he was set to fight another KROQ personality in a boxing exhibition which was being billed as the "Bleeda in Reseda."&lt;ref name=JKbio&gt;{{cite web |title=Jimmy Kimmel bio |url=http://jimmykimmel.net/jkbio.htm |publisher=[[Jimmy Kimmel]] |accessdate=March 13, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/668nJ29eB?url=http://jimmykimmel.net/jkbio.htm |archivedate=March 13, 2012 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Carolla parlayed this opportunity into a long-running friendship and business partnership with Kimmel as well as a recurring role on ''Kevin and Bean'' as cranky woodshop teacher, Mr. Birchum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Infinity Launches FREE FM as Stern Replacement Strategy |url=http://creativemac.digitalmedianet.com/articles/viewarticle.jsp?id=35329 |accessdate=March 13, 2012 |newspaper=[[Infinity Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=October 26, 2005 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/668nkNOuR?url=http://creativemac.digitalmedianet.com/articles/viewarticle.jsp?id=35329 |archivedate=March 13, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Loveline''===
In October 1995, after being signed to the [[William Morris Endeavor|William Morris Agency]] by [[Mark Itkin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://adamcarolla.com/store/ |title=Store |publisher=Adamcarolla.com |date= |accessdate=February 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carolla was offered the job of co-hosting the radio call-in show ''[[Loveline]].'' His co-hosts were the physician [[Drew Pinsky]] ("Dr. Drew") and [[Riki Rachtman]]. Carolla received the offer after Pinsky heard him on ''Kevin and Bean''&lt;ref name="IMDB bio"/&gt; (Rachtman left the show the following year.)&lt;ref name="UMNDaily"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.mndaily.com/sites/default/files/paper-pdfs/1996/08/09/1996-08-09.pdf |title=Laying it on the Loveline |last=Cowan |first=Michael |date=August 9, 1996 |accessdate=March 13, 2012 |publisher=[[Minnesota Daily]] |archivedate=March 13, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/668iyAWfi?url=http://www.dolland.net/loveline/cache/laying/index.html |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Loveline'' is broadcast on [[KROQ-FM]] in Los Angeles and is syndicated nationwide on the [[Westwood One (1976–2011)|Westwood One]] radio network.

While the format of the program was primarily a call-in show where listeners would ask questions about sex and relationships, Carolla would often spend much of the show ranting about various topics, from fart jokes to extended parodies of radio morning shows, including mocking the format's penchant for useless and repetitive weather and traffic reports. In contrast to the reserved, thoughtful Pinsky, Carolla served as the loud, funny side of the show. Carolla's character was described by one reviewer as "a toned-down version of [[Howard Stern]] minus the huge ego".&lt;ref name="UMNDaily"/&gt; On September 25, 2001 Carolla and Jimmy Kimmel both had filled in for Howard Stern's head writer [[Jackie Martling]] after Martling's departure from the show in March 2001. Carolla had mentioned in various interviews and on his podcast that he was offered the job to replace Jackie Martling, but turned it down primarily due to Stern's show being located in New York as well as his commitment to ''Loveline''.

===The Adam Carolla Show===
{{Main|The Adam Carolla Show (radio)}}
In October 2005, Carolla was announced as the host of a new morning radio show on the [[Infinity Broadcasting Corporation|Infinity Broadcasting]] network. His new show would replace the popular syndicated [[The Howard Stern Show|Howard Stern Show]] (which was moving to [[satellite radio]]) in twelve of the 27 markets in which Stern had been broadcast including Los Angeles, [[Las Vegas]], San Francisco, [[San Diego]], [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], and [[Portland, Oregon]].&lt;ref name=SternReplacement&gt;{{cite news |last=Thomas |first=Karen |title=Infinity signs Roth and Carolla |url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/media/2005-10-25-stern-replacements_x.htm |accessdate=March 19, 2012 |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |date=October 25, 2005 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66HeHVD0K?url=http://www.usatoday.com/money/media/2005-10-25-stern-replacements_x.htm |archivedate=March 19, 2012 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Adam Carolla Show'' debuted in January 2006.

In early 2009, actor [[Gerard Butler]] sat in and observed Adam Carolla on ''[[The Adam Carolla Show (terrestrial radio)|The Adam Carolla Show]]'' in order to prepare for his role in [[The Ugly Truth]] as the cynical and crass talk-radio host&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adamcarolla.com/ACPBlog/2009/10/26/adam-lucas-foster-and-michael-irby/|title=Adam, Lucas Foster and Michael Irby|date=October 26, 2009|accessdate=2017-04-11|archivedate=April 15, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110415015911/http://www.adamcarolla.com/ACPBlog/2009/10/26/adam-lucas-foster-and-michael-irby/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mike Chadway allegedly based on Adam Carolla.

On February 18, 2009, [[The Adam Carolla Show (radio)|The Adam Carolla Show]] was canceled as part of a format switch at [[KAMP-FM|KLSX]] to AMP FM, a new top 40 station. The final show was Friday, February 20, 2009.&lt;ref name="ocreg"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ocregister.com/articles/cbs-radio-amp-2311999-jack-format |title=KLSX will drop talk radio format to play Top 40 music &amp;#124; cbs, radio, amp, jack, format – Entertainment |publisher=OCRegister.com |date=February 18, 2009 |accessdate=October 10, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090603075655/http://www.ocregister.com/articles/cbs-radio-amp-2311999-jack-format |archivedate=June 3, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Adam Carolla Podcast===
{{Main|The Adam Carolla Show (podcast)}}
Carolla started a daily podcast on February 23, 2009, at his personal website, which would evolve into the [[ACE Broadcasting Network]]. The first Adam Carolla podcast was downloaded more than 250,000 times in the initial 24 hours, and by the third podcast, it was the number one podcast on iTunes in both the U.S. and Canada.&lt;ref name = "podcast"&gt;

''Ace in the Hole'' was to star Carolla as a husband and father who works as a driving instructor. Carolla created and wrote the pilot with Kevin Hench ("Jimmy Kimmel Live!").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118000437 |title=Adam Carolla gets CBS pilot |first=Michael |last=Schneider |date=February 21, 2009 | work=Variety}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carolla stated that [[Pamela Adlon]] was to play his wife and [[Windell Middlebrooks]] of the Miller High Life commercial fame will play his best friend. During his March 30, 2009, podcast, Carolla briefly described the show as being "''[[All in the Family]]'', essentially", with Carolla playing a similar role to that of [[Archie Bunker]]. On the July 23, 2009, episode of the Adam Carolla Podcast, Carolla announced that CBS was not picking up the pilot for the 2009 season, "in any way, shape or form."

On October 22, 2009, it was reported in ''Variety'' that Carolla had struck a deal with NBC to produce a half-hour pilot for a sitcom.

Carolla's book ''Not Taco Bell Material'' was published by Crown Archetype on June 12, 2012.&lt;ref name=NotTacoBellMaterial&gt;{{cite web |title=Not Taco Bell Material |url=http://www.randomhouse.com/book/212426/not-taco-bell-material-by-adam-carolla |publisher=[[Random House]] |accessdate=March 15, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66BbAxivF?url=http://www.randomhouse.com/book/212426/not-taco-bell-material-by-adam-carolla |archivedate=March 15, 2012 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; It climbed the ''New York Times'' bestseller list and received widespread praise for its satirical humor and honest, self-deprecating style.

In ''President Me: The America That's in My Head,'' Carolla presents the comedian's fantasy of the United States with him at the helm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/adam-carolla-outlines-his-america-in-new-book-president-me/2014/05/23/e5a7f80e-dabf-11e3-b745-87d39690c5c0_story.html |title=Adam Carolla outlines his America in new book, 'President Me'|first=John|last=Wilwol|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=2017-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked in separate interviews, both before and after the book's release, about whether the "if-I-were-king" critique of America was a serious piece, he said it's both: "Well, there's a lot of jokes in it, but you know, it's like... Well, if you have a fat friend you may make a lot of fat jokes about your fat friend, but he's still fat".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/oreilly/index.html|title=The O'Reilly Factor|date=May 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://funemploymentradio.com/2013/08/27/funemployment-radio-episode-929/ |title=Funemployment Radio Comedy Podcast – Adam Carolla |publisher=Funemploymentradio.com |date=August 27, 2013 |accessdate=February 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carolla's latest book is ''Daddy, Stop Talking!: And Other Things My Kids Want but won't be Getting,'' in which Carolla writes about modern parenting. Carolla describes what he believes adults must do if they don't want to have to support their kids forever. Carolla uses his own childhood as a cautionary tale, and decries [[helicopter parenting]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

==Controversies==
Carolla has occasionally made generalizations about various groups, leading to criticism. For example, in a late-2003 ''[[Loveline]]'' episode, Carolla said that Hawaiians are "dumb," "in-bred," "retarded, " people who are among the "dumbest people we have." The comments were met with anger in Hawaii and resulted in ''Loveline''{{'}}s cancellation on Hawaiian affiliate KPOI.&lt;ref&gt;Cataluna, Lee (December 23, 2003).[http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2003/Dec/23/ln/ln48alee.html "KPOI, listeners cry foul"], ''Honolulu Advertiser''.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the April 4, 2010, episode of ''[[The Adam Carolla Show (podcast)|The Adam Carolla Show]]'', Carolla referred to Filipino boxer [[Manny Pacquiao]] as a "fucking idiot" and said of the [[Philippines]]: "They got this and sex tours, that's all they have over there. Get your shit together, Philippines." A spokesman for President [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] called Carolla an "ignorant fool." Carolla subsequently apologized via Twitter.&lt;ref name=pacquiao1&gt;{{Cite news | title = US comedian calls Pacquiao 'illiterate', bashes Pinoys | newspaper = ABS-CBN | location =Manila, Philippines | date = April 4, 2010 | url =http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/sports/04/04/10/us-comedian-calls-pacquiao-illiterate-bashes-pinoys | accessdate =January 24, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110202175833/http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/sports/04/04/10/us-comedian-calls-pacquiao-illiterate-bashes-pinoys| archivedate=February 2, 2011| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pacquiao2&gt;{{Cite news |title = Adam Carolla Angers Philippines With Rant About Pacquiao, Sex Tourism |work=Huffington Post | date = April 5, 2010 | url =http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/04/05/adam-carolla-angers-phili_n_525412.html | accessdate =January 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carolla, Adam.

He said on air that gay activists should "[j]ust get married, and please shut up" and that "Y.U.C.K." would be more memorable acronym than [[LGBT]], and referring to [[transgender]] people he asked: "When did we start giving a shit about these people?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paperlined.org/external/Adam_Carolla_2011-08-11.html |title=Transcript of the August 11, 2011, Adam Carolla Show |publisher=Paperlined.org|date=August 11, 2011 |accessdate=October 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation]] characterized the previous remarks by Carolla as offensive, including an assertion that "all things being equal," heterosexual parents make better parents than homosexual parents. Carolla responded: "I'm sorry my comments were hurtful. I'm a comedian, not a politician."&lt;ref&gt;TMZ Staff (August 15, 2011).[http://www.tmz.com/2011/08/15/glaad-adam-carolla-lgbt-lesbian-gay-bisexual-transgender-the-adam-carolla-show-podcast-loveline-comedy-intolerance-transgender/ "Adam Carolla – Gay Rights Group PISSED Over Anti-LGBT Tirade"], ''TMZ''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rich Ferraro (August 15, 2011).[http://www.glaad.org/releases/08152011carolla "GLAAD Taking Action Against Adam Carolla's Anti-LGBT Remarks"].

In June 2012, Carolla became the target of charges of sexism due to his remarks during an interview published in the ''New York Post'':&lt;ref&gt;Larry Getlen.[http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/the_man_man_NS5UgwY5j06KwJp4WY1OJL "The Man's Man"]. ''The NY Post''. June 16, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation |'''The lesson you learned from a sexual harassment seminar was "Don't hire chicks." Do you hate working with women?'''

No. But they make you hire a certain number of chicks, and they're always the least funny on the writing staff. The reason why you know more funny dudes than funny chicks is that dudes are funnier than chicks. If my daughter has a mediocre sense of humor, I'm just gonna tell her, "Be a staff writer for a sitcom. Because they'll have to hire you, they can't really fire you, and you don't have to produce that much. It'll be awesome."

'''The "are women funny" debate has grown very contentious. You're not worried about reactions to this?'''

I don't care. When you're picking a basketball team, you'll take the brother over the guy with the yarmulke. Why? Because you're playing the odds. When it comes to comedy, of course there's [[Sarah Silverman]], [[Tina Fey]], [[Kathy Griffin]] – super-funny chicks. But if you're playing the odds? No. If [[Joy Behar]] or [[Sherri Shepherd]] was a dude, they'd be off TV. They're not funny enough for dudes. What if [[Roseanne Barr]] was a dude? Think we'd know who she was? Honestly.}}

==Personal life==
On September 28, 2002, Carolla married Lynette Paradise. Lynette gave birth to their first children, twins Natalia and Santino "Sonny" Richard Carolla on June 7, 2006.&lt;ref name="people.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,26334,1201577,00.html|title=Adam Carolla, Wife Welcome Twins|date=June 7, 2006|accessdate=February 20, 2008|last=White|first=Nicholas|work=People|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080324021119/http://www.people.com/people/article/0%2C26334%2C1201577%2C00.html|archivedate=March 24, 2008|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On ''[[The Adam Carolla Show (terrestrial radio)|The Adam Carolla Show]]'', Adam repeatedly mentioned the birth was originally scheduled for June 6, but that he and Lynette decided to push it back one day as to avoid the symbolic [[Number of the Beast|666]] (06–06–06).

Carolla was a part owner of Amalfi, an Italian restaurant in Los Angeles. The restaurant is now closed.&lt;ref name=MyLAtoZ&gt;{{cite news |last=Reich |first=Ashley |title=My LA to Z: Adam Carolla |url=http://www.lamag.com/culture/mylatoz/Story.aspx?id=1335283 |accessdate=March 15, 2012 |newspaper=[[Los Angeles (magazine)|Los Angeles]] |date=December 1, 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66BW0fQak?url=http://www.lamag.com/culture/mylatoz/Story.aspx?id=1335283 |archivedate=March 15, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carolla conceived the fortified wine cocktail '[[Mangria]]' (a pun on [[sangria]]), which later became commercialized with the Napa Valley-based ''Patio Wine Company'' as a partner.

===Religious and political views===
Regarding his religious beliefs, Carolla has stated, "I am not agnostic. I am [[Atheism|atheist]]. I don't think there is no God; I know there's no God. I know there's no God the same way I know many other laws in our universe. I know there's no God and I know most of the world knows that as well. They just won't admit it because there's another thing they know: they know they're going to die, and it freaks them out. So most people don't have the courage to admit there's no God and they know it. They feel it. They try to suppress it. And if you bring it up they get angry because it freaks them out."&lt;ref name="Atheism"&gt;{{cite web |title=Adam with Jeff Probst and Louis C.K. |url=http://adamradio.wordpress.com/2006/02/10/adam-with-jeff-probst-and-louis-ck/ |work=The Official Adam Carolla Show Blog |date=February 2, 2006 |accessdate=August 9, 2008 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66A7ajJCB?url=https://adamradio.wordpress.com/2006/02/10/adam-with-jeff-probst-and-louis-ck/ |archivedate=March 14, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQMQxJKKjcU |title=Adam Carolla on religion |work=Youtube |date=February 5, 2008 |accessdate=October 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding his political views, Carolla has stated, "I guess I would be [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], in the sense that I want a secure border, I'm not into the [[Social programs in the United States|welfare state]], I'm not into all those [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program|freebie lunch programs]]. It just kind of demeans people." He goes on to state, however, that he is also in favor of typically [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] causes such as the legalization of [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] and support for as well some [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] causes such as "...&amp;nbsp; [being] against [[Semi-automatic firearm|semi-automatic]] and [[Automatic firearm|automatic weapons]]. I'm not an [[National Rifle Association|NRA]] guy by any stretch of the imagination. I'd like alternative energy to be explored and electric cars to be used, but I want them to be powered by nuclear power plants."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popeater.com/2010/11/05/adam-carolla-interview-book/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150103114440/http://www.popeater.com/2010/11/05/adam-carolla-interview-book/|archivedate=January 3, 2015 |title=Adam Carolla: 'I'm Republican, But I'd Like Pot Legalized' |publisher=PopEater.com |date=November 5, 2010 |accessdate=September 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; (He is a member of the advisory board of the [[Marijuana Policy Project]].)&lt;ref name=MPP_Board/&gt; Elsewhere, he has stated, "My feeling is this whole country is founded on the principle of 'If you are not hurting anyone, and you're not fucking with someone else's shit, and you are paying your taxes, you should be able to just do what you want to do.' It's the freedom and the independence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adamcarolla.com/ACPBlog/2010/04/19/adam-with-cheech-and-chong/ |title="Adam Carolla with Cheech and Chong" Podcast |publisher=Adamcarolla.com |date=April 19, 2010 |accessdate=October 10, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009023734/http://www.adamcarolla.com/ACPBlog/2010/04/19/adam-with-cheech-and-chong/ |archivedate=October 9, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason TV]]'', Carolla described his views as [[Libertarianism|libertarian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urdV5DwT4Ns|title=Adam Carolla Uncensored: Legalize Drugs, Cut Taxes, Drive Through Red Lights! |publisher=YouTube|date=September 20, 2010|accessdate=2017-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
