==Acting career==
===Early work===
When he was approximately 15, Stiller obtained a small part with one line on the television soap opera ''[[Guiding Light]]'', although in an interview he characterized his performance as poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Something Something Japanese|series=[[Conan (talk show)|Conan]]|airdate=July 26, 2012|season=2|number=121|network=[[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was later cast in a role in the 1986 Broadway revival of [[John Guare]]'s ''[[The House of Blue Leaves]]'', alongside [[John Mahoney]]; the production would garner four [[Tony Award]]s.&lt;ref name="Tis"/&gt; 

During its run, Stiller produced a satirical [[mockumentary]] whose principal was fellow actor Mahoney. His comedic work was well received by the cast and crew of the play, and he followed up with a 10-minute short called ''The Hustler of Money'', a parody of the [[Martin Scorsese]] film ''[[The Color of Money]]''. The film featured him in a send-up of [[Tom Cruise]]'s character and Mahoney in the [[Paul Newman]] role, only this time as a [[bowling]] hustler instead of a [[Hustling|pool shark]]. The short got the attention of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', which aired it in 1987, and two years later offered him a spot as a writer.&lt;ref name="Tis"/&gt; 

In the meantime, he had a bit role in [[Steven Spielberg]]'s ''[[Empire of the Sun (film)|Empire of the Sun]]''.&lt;ref name="EmpireHorses"&gt;{{cite news|last=Svetkey|first=Benjamin|title=Our Son the Comedian|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20053133,00.html|date=October 16, 1992|accessdate=January 9, 2010|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100113025333/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20053133,00.html|archivedate=January 13, 2010|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, Stiller wrote and appeared on ''Saturday Night Live'' as a featured performer. However, since the show did not want him to make more short films, he left after four episodes.&lt;ref name="Tis"/&gt; He then put together ''Elvis Stories'', a short film about a fictitious tabloid focused on recent sightings of [[Elvis Presley]].&lt;ref name="ElvisStories"&gt;{{cite news|last=Wickstrom|first=Andy|title=The King Lives in 'Elvis Stories'|work=[[Boca Raton News]]|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=X8UPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=zIwDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5430,1125901&amp;dq=ben+stiller+elvis+stories&amp;hl=en|date=January 5, 1990|accessdate=January 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film starred friends and co-stars [[John Cusack]], [[Jeremy Piven]], [[Mike Myers (actor)|Mike Myers]], [[Andy Dick]], and Jeff Kahn.&lt;ref name="ElvisStories"/&gt; The film was considered a success, and led him to develop the short film ''Going Back to Brooklyn'' for [[MTV]]; it was a music video starring comedian [[Colin Quinn]] that parodied [[LL Cool J]]'s recent hit "[[Going Back to Cali (LL Cool J song)|Going Back to Cali]]".&lt;ref name="BackBrooklyn"&gt;{{cite news|title=Stiller gets serious|work=[[The Washington Post]]|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=WT&amp;p_theme=wt&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EED25DFF4A38F12&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|registration=yes|date=September 28, 2001|accessdate=January 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|The Ben Stiller Show}}
Producers at MTV were so impressed with ''Back to Brooklyn'' that they offered Stiller a 13-episode show in the experimental "vid-com" format.&lt;ref name="BSBio"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wills|first=Dominic|title=Ben Stiller – Biography|publisher=[[Tiscali]]|url=http://www.talktalk.co.uk/entertainment/film/biography/artist/ben-stiller/biography/7|accessdate=January 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Titled ''The Ben Stiller Show'', this series mixed comedy sketches with music videos and parodied various television shows, music stars, and films. It starred Stiller, along with main writer Jeff Khan and Harry O'Reilly, with his parents and sister making occasional appearances.&lt;ref name="BSBio"/&gt;

Although the show was canceled after its first season, it led to another show titled ''[[The Ben Stiller Show]]'', on the [[Fox Network]] in 1992. The series aired 12 episodes on Fox, with a 13th unaired episode broadcast by [[Comedy Central]] in a later revival.&lt;ref name="CC13th"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bianculli|first=David|title='Stiller' Gonna Make Sat.

Throughout its short run, ''The Ben Stiller Show'' frequently appeared at the bottom of the ratings, even as it garnered critical acclaim and eventually won an [[Primetime Emmy Award|Emmy Award]] for "[[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Variety, Music or Comedy Program|Outstanding Writing in a Variety or Music Program]]" posthumously.&lt;ref name="CC13th"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EWEmmy"&gt;{{cite news |first=Josh|last=Wolk|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,552650,00.html|title=Stiller Standing|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=December 5, 2003|accessdate=March 29, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090425165600/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,552650,00.html|archivedate=April 25, 2009|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AboutPolar"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Read|first1=Kimberly|last2=Purse|first2=Marsia|date=August 4, 2007|publisher=About.com|title=Ben Stiller – Actor/Comedian|url=http://bipolar.about.com/cs/celebs/a/benstiller.htm|accessdate=March 29, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214155217/http://bipolar.about.com/cs/celebs/a/benstiller.htm|archivedate=February 14, 2009|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stiller had a few minor roles in the early 1990s, in films such as ''[[Stella (1990 film)|Stella]]'', ''[[Highway to Hell (film)|Highway to Hell]]'', and in a cameo, ''[[The Nutt House]]''. In 1992, Stiller was approached to direct ''[[Reality Bites]]'', based on a script by Helen Childress. Stiller devoted the next year and a half to rewriting the script with Childress, fundraising, and recruiting cast members for the film. It was eventually released in early 1994, directed by Stiller and featuring him as a co-star.&lt;ref name="Tis"/&gt; The film was produced by [[Danny DeVito]], who would later direct Stiller's 2003 film ''[[Duplex (film)|Duplex]]'' and produce his 2004 film ''[[Along Came Polly]]''.&lt;ref name="BitesDevito"&gt;{{cite news|title=Ben Stiller Finds 'Reality' is in the Genes|work=[[New Straits Times]]|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ie8VAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=1xMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4107,1370578&amp;dq=danny+devito+reality+bites&amp;hl=en|date=February 15, 1994|accessdate=January 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stiller joined his parents in the family film ''[[Heavyweights]]'' (1995), in which he played two roles, and then had a brief uncredited role in [[Adam Sandler]]'s ''[[Happy Gilmore]]'' (1996).&lt;ref name="HeavyParents"&gt;{{cite news|last=Holden|first=Stephen|title=Spoofing the TV Gurus of Fitness|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/17/movies/film-review-spoofing-the-tv-gurus-of-fitness.html|date=February 17, 1995|accessdate=January 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HappyCameo"&gt;{{cite news|last=Lowry|first=Brian|title=Happy Gilmore|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117910802.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1|date=February 19, 1996|accessdate=January 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Next, he had lead roles in ''[[If Lucy Fell]]'' and ''[[Flirting with Disaster (film)|Flirting with Disaster]]'', before tackling his next directorial effort with ''[[The Cable Guy]]'', which starred [[Jim Carrey]].

Also in 1996, MTV invited Stiller to host the [[VH1]] Fashion Awards. Along with ''[[Saturday Night Live|SNL]]'' writer Drake Sather, Stiller developed a short film for the awards about a male model known as Derek Zoolander. It was so well received that he developed another short film about the character for the 1997 VH1 Fashion Awards and finally remade the skit into a film.&lt;ref name="Tis"/&gt;

===Comedic work===
In 1998, Stiller put aside his directing ambitions to star in a surprise hit with a long-lasting cult following, the Farrelly Brothers' ''[[There's Something About Mary]]'', alongside [[Cameron Diaz]]. That year, he starred in several dramas, including ''[[Zero Effect]]'', ''[[Your Friends &amp; Neighbors]]'', and ''[[Permanent Midnight]]''.

In 2001, Stiller directed his third feature film, ''[[Zoolander]]'', starring himself as Derek Zoolander. The film featured multiple cameos from a variety of celebrities, including [[Donald Trump]], [[Paris Hilton]], [[Lenny Kravitz]], [[Heidi Klum]], and [[David Bowie]], among others.
