==Biography==
Haydn was born on 10 March 1905 in [[Camberwell]], [[London]]. After working as a music hall entertainer and overseer of a Jamaican banana plantation, he joined a touring British theatre troupe,&lt;ref name="nytimes-bio"/&gt; and then moved into television and film.

In the DVD commentary of ''[[Young Frankenstein]]'', [[Mel Brooks]] said that Haydn eschewed the Hollywood lifestyle, and that he used gardening and horticulture as a means of escape.

Following a heart attack, Haydn died on 25 April 1985 in Los Angeles. His body was found in his home in [[Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles|Pacific Palisades]]&lt;ref name="lat"&gt;{{cite news|title=Body of Actor Richard Haydn Found in His Palisades Home|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1985-04-26/news/mn-20893_1_actor-richard-haydn|accessdate=14 December 2017|work=Los Angeles Times|date=April 26, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was donated to the [[University of California, Los Angeles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=Scott|title=Resting Places: The Burial Sites of More Than 14,000 Famous Persons, 3d ed.|date=2016|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9781476625997|page=326|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FOHgDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA326&amp;dq=%22George+Richard+Haydon%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjaq66Yo4jYAhVjC8AKHX1ZDJAQ6AEIUDAH#v=onepage&amp;q=%22George%20Richard%20Haydon%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=14 December 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Television and film==
[[File:RichardHaydn2.gif|thumb|Haydn as Thomas Rogers in the 1945 film ''[[And Then There Were None (1945 film)|And Then There Were None]]'']]
Haydn was known for playing eccentric characters, such as Edwin Carp (on a 1964 episode of ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]''), Claud Curdle (''[[Mr. Music]]'', 1950), Richard Rancyd (''[[Miss Tatlock's Millions]]'', 1948) and Stanley Stayle (''[[Dear Wife]]'', 1949).{{clarify|date=December 2010}} Much of his stage delivery was done in a deliberate over-nasalized and over-enunciated manner. 

He is particularly notable for his performance as the voice of the Caterpillar in the 1951 Disney animated adaptation of ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'', and for his small role of Herr Falkstein in the 1974 [[Mel Brooks]] classic comedy ''[[Young Frankenstein]]''. Haydn was also memorable as the manservant Rogers in the 1945 adaptation of [[Agatha Christie]]'s ''[[And Then There Were None]]''. He is also well remembered for his role as William Brown in the 1962 version of [[Mutiny on the Bounty (1962 film)|Mutiny on the Bounty]]. Perhaps his most acclaimed role, however, was in [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]]'s 1965 film musical ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]'', in which he played the Von Trapps' family friend Max Detweiler.

Haydn performed as the nosy neighbour and gossip in ''[[Sitting Pretty (1948 film)|Sitting Pretty]]'' with Clifton Webb and Maureen O'Hara in 1948, using his over-nasal voice. He was Prof. Summerlee in 1960's ''[[The Lost World (1960 film)|The Lost World]]'', and in the same year played opposite Doris Day in ''[[Please Don't Eat the Daisies]]''.

In the 1960 ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'' episode "[[A Thing About Machines]]", he portrayed Mr. Bartlett Finchley, a quirky, self-absorbed, [[technophobia|technophobe]] who is confronted by every machine in his home. On 1 April 1964, he reprised the Edwin Carp character, a poet and an expert on fish, in an episode of ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]'' which saluted several [[old-time radio]] performers.

On 11 April 1968 he appeared as a Japanese businessman on the episode of ''[[Bewitched]]'' entitled "A Majority of Two". On 23 February 1969, he played the Magician who had twin daughters on the episode of ''[[Bonanza]]'' entitled "The Lady and the Mountain Lion" (S10/Ep21). On 12 January 1973 he appeared as Edward the butler in season 4 episode 15 of ''[[Love American Style]]'' entitled "Love and the Impossible Gift".

==Other work==
On [[Old-time radio|radio]], Haydn played Professor Carp on ''[[Edgar Bergen#The Charlie McCarthy Show|The Charlie McCarthy Show]]'',&lt;ref name="rp"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Terrace|first1=Vincent|title=Radio Programs, 1924-1984: A Catalog of More Than 1800 Shows|date=1999|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company, Inc.|isbn=978-0-7864-4513-4|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he was a regular on ''The Swan Soap Show'', which featured [[Burns and Allen#Radio|George Burns and Gracie Allen]].{{r|rp|page1=323}} Haydn authored one book, ''The Journal of Edwin Carp'', in 1954.

He debuted on Broadway in 1939 in ''[[Set to Music]]'' and subsequently appeared in ''[[Two for the Show (musical)]]'' (1940).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Richard Haydn|url=https://www.ibdb.com/broadway-cast-staff/richard-haydn-44595|website=Internet Broadway Database|publisher=The Broadway League|accessdate=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
