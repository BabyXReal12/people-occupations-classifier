'''Waen Shepherd''' (born 23 October 1971) is an English composer, actor and comedian. Originally from [[Yorkshire]], England, he now lives in London.

==Career==
Following his days as a stand-up poet and fringe actor, Shepherd started out performing bizarre experimental [[monologues]] at the early ''[[Cluub Zarathustra]]'', touring with spoof [[techno]] band and [[Edinburgh]] sell-out The Pod with fellow comedian/musicians [[Tim Hope]] and [[Julian Barratt]]. He hosted the underground [[cabaret]] ''Gritty Fingers'' and smashed up [[Cornish pasties]] in the guise of ranting Northern madman William Whicker.

He graduated from [[Oxford University]] in 1993, with a degree in Philosophy and [[Psychology]].

He went on to co-write and narrate award-winning animation ''The Wolfman'' (screened on [[Channel 4]] and subsequently worked into an advertisement for the [[Sony Playstation]]), before writing, directing and starring in his own animation ''Origen's Wake'' for [[Channel 4]]'s Comedy Lab series.

Since then, Shepherd concentrated on developing a number of comedy characters on stage, partly through his work as one half of Shepherd &amp; Farnaby in their shows ''Animal Pie'' and Peterford Golf Club, and partly through his solo work on the comedy circuit.

In 2003, Shepherd created a deluded monster in the form of [[Gary Le Strange]], melding his love of composing with that of creating original comedy characters. He went on to win the [[Perrier Award]] ''Best Newcomer'' (2003) for that debut performance. He achieved [[cult]] success, hosting a "Club Le Strange" comedy evening at ''The Albany'' in London.

Shepherd enjoys portraying exaggerated or absurd characters, and appeared in two series of [[BBC2]]'s science fiction comedy, ''[[Hyperdrive (TV series)|Hyperdrive]]'', as Captain Helix. He has also appeared on [[BBC Radio 2]]'s ''Out to Lunch'' programme.

In 2007, Shepherd appeared in a short film by [[Tim Plester]] entitled ''World of Wrestling'', in which he played [[Adrian Street|'Exotic' Adrian Street]], a wrestler with the flamboyance of a drag queen. He also has had two roles in Series 1 of ''[[We Are Klang]]'' as 'The Juggler' and a Hungarian prince. Shepherd played the role of deluded teacher, [[List of The Inbetweeners characters#Mr Kennedy|Mr. Kennedy]], in the award-winning second and third series of ''[[The Inbetweeners]]''.

Shepherd was cited as one of the Top 50 British comedians by ''[[The Times]]''{{when|date=February 2017}} and he is included as one of the Top 50 Cult Comedian Icons in the [[Rough Guide]] series of books. Shepherd's dedication to British comedy has been honoured by the inclusion of his name on the famous Comedy Carpet at Blackpool, under the guise of Gary Le Strange.

Shepherd has written several theme tunes and music for television and radio. He is the series composer for ''[[Crackanory]]'' and ''[[Murder in Successville]]'', both produced by [[Tiger Aspect]]. He has composed music for several films, including the 2015 feature-film ''The Ghoul'' directed by Gareth Tunley.
