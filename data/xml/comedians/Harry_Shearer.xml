'''Harry Julius Shearer''' (born December 23, 1943) is an American actor, voice actor, comedian, writer, musician, radio host, director and producer. Born in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], Shearer began his career as a child actor. From 1969 to 1976, Shearer was a member of [[The Credibility Gap]], a radio comedy group. Following the breakup of the group, Shearer co-wrote the film ''[[Real Life (1979 film)|Real Life]]'' with [[Albert Brooks]] and started writing for [[Martin Mull]]'s television series ''[[Fernwood 2 Night]]''.

Shearer was a cast member on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' between 1979 and 1980, and 1984 and 1985. Shearer co-created, co-wrote and co-starred in the 1984 film ''[[This Is Spinal Tap]]'', a [[satire|satirical]] [[rockumentary]], which became a cult hit. In 1989, he joined the cast of the animated sitcom ''[[The Simpsons]]''; he provides voices for characters including [[Mr. Burns]], [[Waylon Smithers]], [[Principal Skinner]], [[Ned Flanders]], [[Reverend Lovejoy]], [[Kent Brockman]], [[Dr. Hibbert]] and more. Shearer has appeared in films including ''[[A Mighty Wind]]'' and ''[[The Truman Show]],'' and has directed two, ''[[Teddy Bears' Picnic (film)|Teddy Bears' Picnic]]'' and ''The Big Uneasy.'' He has written three books. Since 1983, Shearer has been the host of the public radio comedy/music program ''[[Le Show]]'', incorporating [[satire]], music, and [[sketch comedy]].

Shearer has won a [[Primetime Emmy Award]], has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] in the radio category, and has received several other Emmy and [[Grammy Award]] nominations. He has been married to singer-songwriter [[Judith Owen]] since 1993. He is currently "artist in residence" at [[Loyola University, New Orleans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.loyno.edu/news/story/2013/6/10/3207 |title='The Simpsons' voice actor Harry Shearer makes a home at Loyola – Loyola University New Orleans |publisher=Loyno.edu |date=2013-06-10 |accessdate=2016-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Shearer was born December 23, 1943, in [[Los Angeles]], the son of Dora Warren (née Kohn; d. 2008), a bookkeeper, and Mack Shearer.&lt;ref name="thejc"/&gt; His parents were [[Jew]]ish emigrants from Austria and Poland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/home/preview.php?id=8329 |title=Shearer Enjoyment |work=[[The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles]] |accessdate=2009-04-30 |date=March 28, 2002 |author=Pfefferman, Naomi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/31034/edition_id/581/format/html/displaystory.html |title=j. – 'Hi-diddly-ho, Marin!' Man of many voices Harry Shearer comes to JCC |work=Jewish Weekly |accessdate=2009-04-30 |date=December 1, 2006 |author=Eskenazi, Joe}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting when Shearer was four years old, he had a piano teacher whose daughter worked as a child actress. The piano teacher later decided to make a career change and become a children's agent, since she knew people in the business through her daughter's work. The teacher asked Shearer's parents for permission to take him to an audition. Several months later, she called Shearer's parents and told them that she had gotten Shearer an audition for the radio show ''[[The Jack Benny Program]]''. Shearer received the role when he was seven years old.&lt;ref name="ign1"&gt;{{cite web |title=Interview with Harry Shearer (Part 1 of 4) |url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/035/035860p1.html |author=Plume, Kenneth |publisher=IGN |date=February 10, 2000 |accessdate=2009-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; He described [[Jack Benny]] as "very warm and approachable [...] He was a guy who dug the idea of other people on the show getting laughs, which sort of spoiled me for other people in comedy."&lt;ref name="avclub"/&gt; Shearer said in an interview that one person who "took him under his wing" and was one of his best friends during his early days in show business was voice actor [[Mel Blanc]], who voiced many animated characters, including [[Bugs Bunny]], [[Daffy Duck]] and [[Barney Rubble]].&lt;ref name="sfgate"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/sfgate/detail?blogid=5&amp;entry_id=11888 |title=Chronicle Podcasts : New Orleans economy stillborn, says Harry Shearer |date=August 25, 2007 |accessdate=2009-04-30 |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shearer made his film debut in the 1953 film ''[[Abbott and Costello Go to Mars]]'', in which he had a small part. Later that year, he later appeared in ''[[The Robe (film)|The Robe]]''.&lt;ref name="avclub"/&gt; Throughout his childhood and teenage years he worked in television, film, and radio.&lt;ref name="avclub"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/harry-shearer,13807/ |title=Harry Shearer |last=Rabin |first=Nathan |date=April 23, 2003 |work=The A.V. Club |accessdate=2009-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1957, Shearer played the precursor to the [[Eddie Haskell]] character in the pilot episode of the television series ''[[Leave It to Beaver]]''. After the filming, Shearer's parents said they did not want him to be a regular in a series. Instead they wanted him to just do occasional work so that he could have a normal childhood. Shearer and his parents made the decision not to accept the role in the series if it was picked up by a television network.&lt;ref name="avclub"/&gt;

Shearer attended [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] as a political science major in the early 1960s and decided to quit show business to become a "serious person".&lt;ref name="ign1"/&gt; However, he says this lasted approximately a month, and he joined the staff of the ''[[Daily Bruin]]'', UCLA's school newspaper, during his first year.&lt;ref name="ign1"/&gt; He was editor of the college humor magazine (Satyr) including the June 1964 parody, Preyboy &lt;ref&gt;Preyboy&lt;/ref&gt; He also worked as a newscaster at KRLA, a top 40 radio station in Pasadena, during this period.  According to Shearer, after graduating, he had "a very serious agenda going on, and it was 'Stay Out of the Draft'."&lt;ref name="ign1"/&gt; He attended [[graduate school]] at [[Harvard University]] for one year and worked at the state legislature in [[Sacramento]]. In 1967 and 1968, he was a high school teacher, teaching English and social studies. He left teaching following "disagreements with the administration."&lt;ref name="ign1"/&gt;

From 1969 to 1976, Shearer was a member of [[The Credibility Gap]], a radio comedy group that included [[David Lander]], [[Richard Beebe]] and [[Michael McKean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url={{Allmusic |class=artist |id=p149 |pure_url=yes}} |title=The Credibility Gap |accessdate=2008-01-02 |author=Deming, Mark |publisher=[[AllMusic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group consisted of "a bunch of newsmen" at [[KRLA 1110]], "the number two station" in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name="avclub"/&gt; They wanted to do more than just straight news, so they hired comedians who were talented vocalists. Shearer heard about it from a friend so he brought over a tape to the station and nervously gave it to the receptionist. He found out he was hired that same day. The group's radio show was canceled in 1970 by KRLA and in 1971 by [[KPPC-FM]], so they started performing in various clubs and concert venues.&lt;ref name="ign1"/&gt; While at KRLA, Shearer also interviewed [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]] for the [[Pop Chronicles]] music documentary.&lt;ref name="Gilliland"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.library.unt.edu/music/special-collections/john-gilliland/e-l |title=Index to Interviews |work=[[Pop Chronicles]] |accessdate=2008-01-02 |authorlink=John Gilliland |last=Gilliland |first=John}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973, Shearer appeared as Jim Houseafire on ''[[How Time Flys]]'', an album by [[The Firesign Theatre]]'s [[David Ossman]]. The Credibility Gap broke up in 1976 when Lander and McKean left to perform in the sitcom ''[[Laverne &amp; Shirley]]''.&lt;ref name="ign1"/&gt; Shearer started working with [[Albert Brooks]], producing one of Brooks' albums and co-writing the film ''[[Real Life (1979 film)|Real Life]]''. Shearer also started writing for [[Martin Mull]]'s television series ''[[Fernwood 2 Night]]''.&lt;ref name="ign1"/&gt; In the mid-1970s, he started working with [[Rob Reiner]] on a pilot for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. The show, which starred [[Christopher Guest]], [[Tom Leopold]] and McKean, was not picked up.&lt;ref name="ign1"/&gt;

==Career==

===''Saturday Night Live''===
In August 1979, Shearer was hired as a writer and cast member on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', one of the first additions to the cast,&lt;ref name="avclub"/&gt; and an unofficial replacement for [[John Belushi]] and [[Dan Aykroyd]], who were both leaving the show.&lt;ref name="ign2"&gt;{{cite web |title=Interview with Harry Shearer (Part 2 of 4) |url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/035/035861p1.html |author=Plume, Kenneth |publisher=IGN |date=February 10, 2000 |accessdate=2009-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Al Franken]] recommended Shearer to ''Saturday Night Live'' creator [[Lorne Michaels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shales|Miller|2002 |p=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shearer describes his experience on the show as a "living hell" and "not a real pleasant place to work."&lt;ref name="ign2"/&gt; He did not get along well with the other writers and cast members and states that he was not included with the cast in the opening montage (although he was added to the montage for latter episodes of the 1979–80 season) and that Lorne Michaels had told the rest of the cast that he was just a writer.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shales|Miller|2002 |p=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michaels left ''Saturday Night Live'' at the end of the fifth season, taking the entire cast with him.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shales|Miller|2002 |p=176}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shearer told new executive producer [[Jean Doumanian]] that he was "not a fan of Lorne's" and offered to stay with the show if he was given the chance to overhaul the program and bring in experienced comedians, like Christopher Guest. However, Doumanian turned him down, so he decided to leave with the rest of the cast.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shales|Miller|2002 |p=210}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote box |width=30em |bgcolor=transparent |align=right |halign=left |quote=When I left, Dick [Ebersol] issued a press release, saying "creative differences." And the first person who called me for a comment on it read me that and I blurted out, "Yeah, I was creative and they were different." |salign=right |source=—Harry Shearer&lt;ref name="Shales287"/&gt;}}
In 1984, while promoting the film ''[[This Is Spinal Tap]]'', Shearer, Christopher Guest and Michael McKean performed on ''Saturday Night Live''. All three members were offered the chance to join the show in the 1984–1985 season. Shearer accepted because he was treated well by the producers and he thought the backstage environment had improved&lt;ref name="ign2"/&gt; but later stated that he "didn't realize that guests are treated better than the regulars."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shales|Miller|2002 |p=261}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guest also accepted the offer while McKean rejected it, although he would join the cast in 1994. [[Dick Ebersol]], who replaced Lorne Michaels as the show's producer, said that Shearer was "a gifted performer but a pain in the butt. He's just so demanding on the preciseness of things and he's very, very hard on the working people. He's just a nightmare-to-deal-with person."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shales|Miller|2002 |p=260}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1985, Shearer left the show for good,&lt;ref name="ign2"/&gt; partially because he felt he was not being used enough.&lt;ref name="Shales287"&gt;{{harvnb|Shales|Miller|2002 |p=287}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Short]] said Shearer "wanted to be creative and Dick [Ebersol] wanted something else. [...] I think he felt his voice wasn't getting represented on the show. When he wouldn't get that chance, it made him very upset."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shales|Miller|2002 |p=288}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spinal Tap===
Shearer co-created, co-wrote and co-starred in [[Rob Reiner]]'s 1984 film ''[[This Is Spinal Tap]]''.&lt;ref name="avclub"/&gt; Shearer, Reiner, Michael McKean and Christopher Guest received a deal to write a first draft of a screenplay for a company called Marble Arch. They decided that the film could not be written and instead filmed a 20-minute demo of what they wanted to do.&lt;ref name="ign2"/&gt; It was eventually greenlighted by [[Norman Lear]] and [[Jerry Perenchio]] at [[Embassy Pictures]].&lt;ref name="ign2"/&gt; The film satirizes the wild personal behavior and musical pretensions of [[hard rock]] and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] bands, as well as the [[hagiography|hagiographic]] tendencies of [[rockumentary|rockumentaries]] of the time. The three core members of the band [[Spinal Tap (band)|Spinal Tap]]—[[David St. Hubbins]], [[Derek Smalls]] and [[Nigel Tufnel]]—were portrayed by McKean, Shearer and Guest respectively. The three actors play their musical instruments and speak with mock English accents throughout the film. There was no script, although there was a written breakdown of most of the scenes, and many of the lines were ad-libbed.&lt;ref name="ign2"/&gt; It was filmed in 25 days.&lt;ref name="ign2"/&gt;

Shearer said in an interview that "The animating impulse was to do rock 'n' roll right. The four of us had been around rock 'n' roll and we were just amazed by how relentlessly the movies got it wrong. Because we were funny people it was going to be a funny film, but we wanted to get it right."&lt;ref name="thejc"/&gt; When they tried to sell it to various Hollywood studios, they were told that the film would not work. The group kept saying, "No, this is a story that's pretty familiar to people. We're not introducing them to anything they don't really know," so Shearer thought it would at least have some resonance with the public.&lt;ref name="avclub"/&gt; The film was only a modest success upon its initial release but found greater success, and a [[cult following]], after its video release. In 2000, the film was ranked 29th on the [[American Film Institute]]'s [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Laughs|list of the top 100 comedy movies in American cinema]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.afi.com/tvevents/100years/laughs.aspx |title=AFI's 100 Years... 100 Laughs |date=June 14, 2000 |publisher=[[American Film Institute]] |accessdate=2009-04-30 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080615021804/http://www.afi.com/tvevents/100years/laughs.aspx |archivedate=June 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.loc.gov/film/titles.html |title=Films Selected to The National Film Registry, Library of Congress 1989–2008 |publisher=[[Library of Congress]] |year=2009 |accessdate=2009-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shearer, Guest and McKean have since worked on several projects as their Spinal Tap characters. They released three albums: ''[[This Is Spinal Tap (album)|This Is Spinal Tap]]'' (1984), ''[[Break Like the Wind]]'' (1992) and ''[[Back from the Dead (Spinal Tap album)|Back From The Dead]]'' (2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/spinaltap/discography |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |accessdate=2009-05-01 |title=Spinal Tap: Discography |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309202710/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/spinaltap/discography |archivedate=March 9, 2009 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, Spinal Tap appeared in an episode of ''The Simpsons'' called "[[The Otto Show]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/simpsons/episodeguide/season3/page22.shtml |title=The Otto Show |accessdate=2009-05-01 |author1=Martyn, Warren |author2=Wood, Adrian |year=2000 |publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band has played several concerts, including at [[Live Earth]] in London on July 7, 2007. In anticipation of the show, Rob Reiner directed a short film entitled ''Spinal Tap''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/film/this-is-climate-change/2007/04/26/1177459821738.html |title=Spinal Tap reunite |work=[[The Age]] |date=April 26, 2007 |accessdate=2009-04-30 |location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the band released ''Back from the Dead'' to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the release of the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Spinal Tap to return with new album |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/feb/04/spinal-tap-record-new-album |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=February 4, 2009 |author=Michaels, Sean |accessdate=2009-04-30 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album features re-recorded versions of songs featured in ''This Is Spinal Tap'' and its soundtrack, and five new songs.&lt;ref name="Erlewine"&gt;{{cite web |last=Erlewine |first=Stephen Thomas |authorlink=Stephen Thomas Erlewine |title=Review of ''Back from the Dead'' |url={{Allmusic |class=album |id=r1575008 |pure_url=yes}} |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=2009-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Sandy |last=Kaczmarski |title=''Unwigged and Unplugged: Spinal Tap Unwiped'' |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/sandy-kaczmarski/unwigged-and-unplugged-sp_b_209526.html |publisher=''[[Huffington Post]]'' |date=May 31, 2009 |accessdate=2009-08-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The band performed a one date "world tour" at London's [[Wembley Arena]] on June 30, 2009. [[The Folksmen]], a mock band featured in the film ''[[A Mighty Wind]]'' that is also made up of characters played by Shearer, McKean and Guest&amp;nbsp;– was the opening act for the show.&lt;ref name="bbcworldtour"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7985487.stm |title=Spinal Tap announce 'world tour' |date=April 6, 2009 |publisher=[[BBC|BBC News]] |accessdate=2009-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Simpsons''===
Shearer is also known for his prolific work as a voice actor on ''The Simpsons''. [[Matt Groening]], the creator of the show, was a fan of Shearer's work, while Shearer was a fan of a column Groening used to write.&lt;ref name="ign3"&gt;{{cite web |title=Interview with Harry Shearer (Part 3 of 4) |url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/035/035862p1.html |author=Plume, Kenneth |publisher=IGN |date=February 10, 2000 |accessdate=2009-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shearer was asked if he wanted to be in the series, but he was initially reluctant because he thought the recording sessions would be too much trouble.&lt;ref name="ign3"/&gt; He felt voice acting was "not a lot of fun" because traditionally, voice actors record their parts separately.&lt;ref name="sfgate"/&gt; He was told that the actors would record their lines together&lt;ref name="sfgate"/&gt; and after three calls, executive producer [[James L. Brooks]] managed to convince Shearer to join the cast.&lt;ref name="thejc"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thejc.com/articles/interview-harry-shearer |title=Interview: Harry Shearer |last=Round |first=Simon |date=October 10, 2008 |work=The Jewish Chronicle |accessdate=2009-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shearer's first impression of ''The Simpsons'' was that it was funny. Shearer, who thought it was a "pretty cool" way to work, found it peculiar that the members of the cast were adamant about not being known to the public as the people behind the voices.&lt;ref name="avclub"/&gt;

Shearer provides voices for [[Principal Skinner]], [[Kent Brockman]], [[Mr. Burns]], [[Waylon Smithers]], [[Ned Flanders]], [[Reverend Timothy Lovejoy|Reverend Lovejoy]], [[Julius Hibbert|Dr. Hibbert]], [[Lenny Leonard]], [[Otto Mann]], [[Rainier Wolfcastle]], [[The Itchy &amp; Scratchy Show|Scratchy]], [[Kang and Kodos|Kang]], [[Dr. Marvin Monroe]], [[Judge Snyder]] and many others.{{sfn|Richmond &amp; Coffman|1997 |pp=178–179}} He has described all of his regular characters' voices as "easy to slip into.

In 2004, Shearer criticized what he perceived as the show's declining quality: "I rate the last three seasons as among the worst, so [[The Simpsons (season 4)|season four]] looks very good to me now."&lt;ref name="legget"&gt;{{cite news |first=Chris |last=Leggett |title=Harry Shearer |publisher=UK Teletext |date=August 4, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shearer has also been vocal about "[[The Principal and the Pauper]]" ([[The Simpsons (season 9)|season nine]], 1997) one of the most controversial episodes of ''The Simpsons''. Many fans and critics reacted negatively to the revelation that [[Principal Seymour Skinner]], a recurring character since the first season, was an impostor. The episode has been criticized by both Shearer and Groening. In a 2001 interview, Shearer recalled that after reading the script, he told the writers, "That's so wrong. You're taking something that an audience has built eight years or nine years of investment in and just tossed it in the trash can for no good reason, for a story we've done before with other characters.

Since 1983, Shearer has been the host of the public radio comedy/music program ''[[Le Show]]''.

On the weekly program Shearer alternates between DJing, reading and commenting on the news of the day after the manner of [[Mort Sahl]], and performing original (mostly political) comedy sketches and songs. In 2008, Shearer released a music CD called ''Songs of the Bushmen'', consisting of his satirical numbers about former President [[George W.
