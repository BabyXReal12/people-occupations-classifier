"&gt;{{harvnb|Lee|2016|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lee currently co-stars in the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] single-camera [[sitcom]] series ''[[Splitting Up Together]]'' alongside [[Jenna Fischer]] and [[Oliver Hudson]].

In 2016, Lee and his girlfriend, Khalyla Kuhn, started a weekly podcast titled ''Tigerbelly'', which currently has over
170,000 subscribers on YouTube.&lt;ref name= "TigerBelly p. "&gt;{{harvnb|TigerBelly|2018|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
===Early life ===

Lee was born '''Robert Lee, Jr.''' in [[San Diego]], [[California]], the son of Jeanie and Robert Lee.&lt;ref name= "Mad TV p. "&gt;{{harvnb|Mad TV|2010|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Grant p. "&gt;{{harvnb|Grant|2004|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The older of two sons, Lee attended [[Poway High School]] in [[Poway, California]].&lt;ref name= "Grant p. "/&gt; He [[Scholastic wrestling|wrestled]] in high school.&lt;ref name= "Schonberger p. "&gt;{{harvnb|Schonberger|2016|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At 18, Lee moved out of his parents' home and took jobs in restaurants and coffee shops in the San Diego area,&lt;ref name= "Nguyen p. "&gt;{{harvnb|Nguyen|2009|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; while also attending [[Palomar College]] for a brief period.&lt;ref name= "Grant p. "/&gt;

===Addiction and sobriety===
He began taking [[Methamphetamine|meth]] and [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] around 12, and went through three drug rehab attempts, ending his meth abuse around 17. During this period of drug abuse, Lee claims that he not only competed in a wrestling tournament under the influence of both Methamphetamine and LSD, but won the tournament.&lt;ref name= "Schonberger p. "/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Archer p. "&gt;{{harvnb|Archer|2013|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Kozlowski p. "&gt;{{harvnb|Kozlowski|2018|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Bobby started with ''Mad TV'', a producer told him that he wasn't funny and that they wouldn't use him in the show very often. This sent Bobby down a spiral of depression and into drugs, ending 12 years of sobriety.&lt;ref name= "Lee-Diaz-Syatt p. 9:30"&gt;{{harvnb|Lee|Diaz|Syatt|2014|p=9:30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bobby got sober after MadTV producer Lauren Dombrowski fought for him after he was fired from the show a second time. Lauren Dombrowski died of cancer on October 8, 2008 in Los Angeles when she was 51.&lt;ref name= "Variety Staff p. "&gt;{{harvnb|Variety Staff|2008|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On TigerBelly Bobby says that one of the only times he cried was at Dombrowski's funeral.

==Career==

In 1994 the coffee shop for which he was working closed.  “I just went next door to get a job,” he said,  “which was The Comedy Store in San Diego” (also known as the La Jolla Comedy Store).&lt;ref name= "Nguyen p. "/&gt; After a few months of working odd jobs at the club he decided to try stand-up during one of their [[amateur]] nights.&lt;ref name= "Nguyen p. "/&gt; Within a year of doing regular comedy sets he got offers to open for both [[Pauly Shore]] and [[Carlos Mencia]].&lt;ref name= "Grant p. "/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Nguyen p. "/&gt; Lee also went on to work regularly at [[The Comedy Store]] in [[Los Angeles]], a comedy club owned by Pauly Shore's mother [[Mitzi Shore|Mitzi]].&lt;ref name= "Grant p. "/&gt;

Lee has admitted in several interviews that his parents had hoped he would continue on with the family business and were less than supportive of his comedic pursuits at first.&lt;ref name= "Grant p. "/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Nguyen p. "/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Yang p. "&gt;{{harvnb|Yang|2007|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a [[podcast]] interview conducted by fellow actor and comedian [[Joe Rogan]] on February 1, 2011, Lee stated that during the first few years he did stand-up his parents barely spoke to him, however after his appearance on ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'' his father called him, and asked how much he had to pay to be on the show and then apologized for not supporting his comedy career after he found out that in fact the Leno show had asked him to appear.&lt;ref name= "Rogan-Lee-Redban p. "&gt;{{harvnb|Rogan|Lee|Redban|2013|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lee's parents currently live in [[Phoenix, Arizona]].&lt;ref name= "Grant p. "/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Yang p. "/&gt; Lee is known to have included his family in some of his work: His younger brother has appeared in several non-speaking roles on ''Mad TV'' and his entire family has appeared in a sketch on the show.&lt;ref name= "Yang p. "/&gt;   Lee also pitched a sitcom to Comedy Central in 2007 about a Korean family which was to star his very own family.&lt;ref name= "Yang p. "/&gt;

===''Mad TV''===

In 2001, Lee joined the cast of ''Mad TV'',&lt;ref name= "Nguyen p. "/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Yang p. "/&gt;  making him the show's only Asian cast member. Lee remained with the cast until the series' cancellation in 2009 and returned briefly when ''MADtv'' was revived in 2016 on The CW.&lt;ref name= "Nguyen p. "/&gt; Some of Lee's recurring characters included:

TigerBelly is a video podcast that is hosted by Bobby Lee and his girlfriend Khalyla Kuhn, which currently has over 170,000 subscribers on YouTube.&lt;ref name="TigerBelly p. "/&gt; Also on camera is the sound engineer Gilbert Galon and behind the scenes producer and frequent on-screen personality George Kimmel. Khalyla became interested in doing podcasts of her own after going on the [[DVDASA]] podcast.&lt;ref name= "Bobby Lee 100 p. 10:45"&gt;{{harvnb|Lee|2017|p=10:45}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show's intro song "Shadow Gook" was written, produced and performed by Bobby Lee.&lt;ref name= "Lee A p. "&gt;{{harvnb|Lee (song)|2016|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hosts then go on to discuss events from their lives and news topics from popular culture, often revolving around [[Asian American]] issues related to the [[entertainment industry]], [[adolescence]], [[sexuality]], [[ethnicity]], [[racism]] and [[politics]]. Towards the end of the show, host Gilbert Galon reads listener questions, which are addressed in a segment jokingly referred to as "Unhelpful Advice".  Periodically, the end of the show features a segment called "The MMA minute" in which the hosts discuss [[mixed martial arts]] and the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]].

====Podcast history====
Bobby and Eric Griffin initially pitched a podcast to [[All Things Comedy]] and they were immediately signed but the two could never make the time to meet.&lt;ref name= "Lee-Griffin 37 p. 1:17:00"&gt;{{harvnb|Lee|Griffin|2016|p=1:17:00}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around this time Bobby and Khalyla were visiting family in the Philippines when she came down with serious heart trouble.&lt;ref name= "Lee-Baldwin-Kalloniatis p. 47:30"&gt;{{harvnb|Lee|Baldwin|Kalloniatis|2017|p=47:30}}&lt;/ref&gt; She spent weeks in hospitals and couldn't return to her nursing job.&lt;ref name= "Lee-Baldwin-Kalloniatis p. 47:30"/&gt;  She needed something to do, to keep busy and so started her own podcast. Bobby came on her show and the chemistry was so good that Bobby decided to drop Griffin and instead focus on podcasts with Khalyla.&lt;ref name= "Lee-Baldwin-Kalloniatis p. 47:30"/&gt; As Tigerbelly grew Bobby and Khalyla needed more help. Bobby and Khalyla had been having technical issues while trying to do podcasts and needed an engineer to watch the computer so they asked Gilbert to handle the technical side of the podcast. Bobby met Gilbert at a viewing of a [[Manny Pacquiao]] fight.&lt;ref name= "Bobby Lee 100 p. 12:00"&gt;{{harvnb|Lee|2017|p=12:00}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bobby met the future producer of TigerBelly, George Kimmel, before TigerBelly when Bobby was recruited to make Maker Studio shows, where Kimmel was working as a producer.&lt;ref name= "Bobby Lee 100 p. 2:03"&gt;{{harvnb|Lee|2017|p=2:03}}&lt;/ref&gt; While producing other YouTube shows for Maker Studios George and Bobby became friends and he was asked to join the TigerBelly team. Kimmel came into the TigerBelly family much later but knew he wanted to be part of the show even offering to be Gilbert's assistant.

====Tilda Swinton controversy====
In episode 71,&lt;ref name= "Lee-Cho 71 p. 29:25"&gt;{{harvnb|Lee|Cho|2016|p=29:25}}&lt;/ref&gt; guest [[Margaret Cho]] recounted an incident that occurred between herself and actress [[Tilda Swinton]].&lt;ref name= "Mandell p. "&gt;{{harvnb|Mandell|2016|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Demby p. "&gt;{{harvnb|Demby|2016|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Jung p. "&gt;{{harvnb|Jung|2018|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Cho, Swinton contacted her via [[email]] to discuss the [[Asian American]] community's reaction to the news that Swinton had been cast to play the character [[Ancient One]] in the movie version of [[Doctor Strange]].&lt;ref name= "Yee p. "&gt;{{harvnb|Yee|2016|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the original comic book, the character is [[Tibetan People|Tibetan]]. According to Swinton, she contacted Cho in order to better understand why Asian Americans were upset about the casting.&lt;ref name= "Desta p. "&gt;{{harvnb|Desta|2016|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the show, Cho tells Lee and Kuhn that she found the inquiry strange since she didn't know Swinton and had never talked to her before, nor did she have anything to do with the movie or casting.

On December 21, Swinton released the email exchange between herself and Cho to the website [[Jezebel (website)|Jezebel]].&lt;ref name= "Juzwiak p. "&gt;{{harvnb|Juzwiak|2016|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Healy p. "&gt;{{harvnb|Healy|2016|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Jang p. "&gt;{{harvnb|Jang|2016|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the release, Cho stated that she stands by her words both on TigerBelly and in the email exchange.&lt;ref name= "Hilton p. "&gt;{{harvnb|Hilton|2016|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Gettell p. "&gt;{{harvnb|Gettell|2018|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mencia controversy===
In 2005, comedian [[Joe Rogan]] wrote a post on his website publicly accusing Mencia of being a [[Plagiarism|plagiarist]], alleging that Mencia [[joke thievery|stole jokes]] from a number of comedians.&lt;ref name= "Rogan p. "&gt;{{harvnb|Rogan|2005|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 10, 2007, Rogan confronted Mencia on stage at the [[Comedy Store]] on Sunset and continued his allegations of plagiarism. Rogan posted a video of the altercation with audio and video clips from other comedians including [[George Lopez]], Reverend Bob Levy, Bobby Lee, and [[Ari Shaffir]], among others.&lt;ref name= "Lussier p. "&gt;{{harvnb|Lussier|2007|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mencia addressed the issue of plagiarism in two hour-long interviews with comic [[Marc Maron]] on his podcast, ''[[WTF with Marc Maron]]'', in May 2010.&lt;ref name= "Maron-Mencia p. "&gt;{{harvnb|Maron|Mencia|2010|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Maron-Mencia-Barcena-Trevino p. "&gt;{{harvnb|Maron|Mencia|Barcena|Trevino|2010|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bobby Lee was brought into the controversy as he has long history with Mencia and was seen as in Mencia's camp. On the [[Norm Macdonald Live]] show Bobby Lee talked about Brian Redban's Deathsquad network (Deathsquad is made up of a number of comedians like Ari Shaffir, Redban, Joey CoCo Diaz) was in a feud with Bobby over Mencia.&lt;ref name= "Lee-Eget p. "&gt;{{harvnb|Lee|Eget|Macdonald|2017|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Years later on Rogan's podcast Bobby talked about how after he did a retraction video in support of Mencia, he was faced with death threats.&lt;ref name= "Rogan-Lee-Redban p. 1:07:01"&gt;{{harvnb|Rogan|Lee|Redban|2013|p=1:07:01}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the ''Comedy Store Podcast'' Bobby Lee was ending a feud between him and Comedy Store fixture Eleanor Kerrigan. She told a story about how her ex-boyfriend Freddy Soto stopped a show at the Comedy Store and kicked Bobby Lee out of the room because he thought, falsely, that Bobby was stealing Freddy Soto's material on behalf of Mencia.&lt;ref name= "Lee-Kerrigan-Ingraham p. 2:03"&gt;{{harvnb|Lee|Kerrigan|Ingraham|2016|p=2:03}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also related how his management team asked him how to rehabilitate Mencia's career and he said that Mencia should do a special showing how Mencia creates incredibly personal material for a special.&lt;ref name= "Lee-Kerrigan-Ingraham p. 59:30"&gt;{{harvnb|Lee|Kerrigan|Ingraham|2016|p=59:30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
His [[Korean American]] parents owned clothing stores in both [[Escondido, California|Escondido]] and [[Encinitas, California]]. His father had a stroke and is still in recovery. Bobby also has a brother [[Steve Lee (artist)|Steve Lee]] who is a musician and host of The Steebee Weebee podcast.
