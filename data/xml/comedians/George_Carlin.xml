'''George Denis Patrick Carlin''' (May 12, 1937 – June 22, 2008) was an American stand-up comedian, actor, author, and social critic.

Carlin was noted for his [[black comedy]] and reflections on politics, the English language, psychology, religion, and various taboo subjects. He and his "[[seven dirty words]]" comedy routine were central to the 1978 [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] case ''[[F.C.C. v. Pacifica Foundation]]'', in which a 5–4 decision affirmed the government's power to [[Censorship in the United States#Broadcast censorship|regulate indecent material on the public airwaves]]. He is widely regarded as one of the most important and influential stand-up comics; one newspaper called Carlin "the dean of [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] comedians".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cleveland.com/people/index.ssf/2008/06/george_carlin_counterculture_c.html |title=George Carlin, counterculture comedians' dean, dies at 71 |first=Michael |last=Norman |work=[[The Plain Dealer]] |location=[[Cleveland, Ohio]] |date=June 23, 2008 |accessdate=June 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2004, he placed second on the [[Comedy Central]] list of "Top 10 Comedians of US Audiences".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comedy-zone.net/standup/comedian/index.htm |title=Stand Up Comedy &amp; Comedians |publisher=Comedy Zone |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051123214352/http://www.comedy-zone.net/standup/comedian/index.htm |archivedate=November 23, 2005 |accessdate=June 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first of Carlin's 14 stand-up comedy specials for [[HBO]] was filmed in 1977. From the late 1980s, Carlin's routines focused on sociocultural criticism of American society. He often commented on contemporary political issues in the United States and satirized the excesses of [[American culture]]. He was a frequent performer and guest host on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson|The Tonight Show]]'' during the three-decade [[Johnny Carson]] era, and hosted the first episode of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in 1975. His final HBO special, ''[[It's Bad for Ya]]'', was filmed less than four months before his death. In 2008, he was posthumously awarded the [[Mark Twain Prize for American Humor]].  In 2017, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine ranked him second (behind [[Richard Pryor]]) on its list of the 50 best stand-up comics of all time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/lists/50-best-stand-up-comics-of-all-time-w464199 The 50 Best Stand-up Comics of All Time].

== Early life ==
George Denis Patrick Carlin&lt;ref name=james7/&gt; was born on May 12, 1937 in [[Manhattan|Manhattan, New York]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people=Carlin, George|title=[[Complaints and Grievances]]|medium=TV|publisher=[[HBO]]|date=November 17, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=[[Last Words (book)|Last Words]]|last=Carlin|first=George|chapter=The Old Man and the Sunbeam|publisher=[[Free Press (publisher)|Free Press]]|date=November 10, 2009|location=New York|page=6|isbn=1-4391-7295-1|quote=Lying there in New York Hospital, my first definitive act on this planet was to vomit.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the younger son of secretary Mary Carlin (''née'' Bearey) and ''[[The Sun (New York)|The Sun]]''{{'s}} advertising manager Patrick John Carlin. His father was an [[Irish people|Irish]] immigrant from [[County Donegal]], while his mother was an [[Irish Americans|Irish-American]]. His maternal grandfather, Dennis Bearey, was an Irish immigrant who worked as an [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] officer. Carlin recalled that his grandmother's maiden name was O'Grady, but it was changed to Grady before she reached the U.S. He later joked that they "dropped the O in the ocean on the way here". He would later name his character on ''[[The George Carlin Show]]'' O'Grady as an act of homage to her.&lt;ref name=NEA&gt;{{cite news |authorlink=Frank Lovece |last=Lovece |first=Frank |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=6vghAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=pKIFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2453,999986 |title=Going, Going, Gone?

His parents separated when he was two months old because of his father's [[alcoholism]]. Mary subsequently raised Carlin and his older brother, Patrick Jr., on her own.&lt;ref name="james7"&gt;{{cite book |first=James |last=Sullivan |title=Seven Dirty Words: The Life and Crimes of George Carlin |publisher=Da Capo Press |year=2010 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IWYmZd1T3HkC&amp;dq=Seven+Dirty+Words:+The+Life+and+Crimes+of+George+Carlin&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |accessdate=June 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carlin said that he picked up an appreciation for the effective use of the English language from his mother,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Conversations on the Edge of the Apocalypse |last=Brown |first=David Jay |authorlink=David Jay Brown |page=196 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |year=2005 |isbn=9781403965325}}&lt;/ref&gt; though they had a difficult relationship, and he often ran away from home.&lt;ref name="playboy"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Playboy Interview: George Carlin|newspaper=[[Playboy]]|author=Merrill, Sam|date=January 1982|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up on West 121st Street, in a neighborhood of Manhattan he said he and his friends called "White Harlem" because that "sounded a lot tougher than its real name" of [[Morningside Heights, Manhattan|Morningside Heights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://blogs.psychologytoday.com/blog/brainstorm/200806/george-carlins-last-interview | work =[[Psychology Today]] | title = George Carlin's last interview |first = Jay | last = Dixit | date = June 23, 2008 |accessdate=June 10, 2014}}{{dead link|date=December 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended Corpus Christi School, a Roman Catholic parish school of the [[Corpus Christi Church (New York City)|Corpus Christi Church]] in Morningside Heights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.georgecarlin.com/update_10-29-08/timeline/early_years.html |title=George Carlin: Early Years |publisher=George Carlin website (''georgecarlin.com'') |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090708072213/http://www.georgecarlin.com/update_10-29-08/timeline/early_years.html |archivedate=July 8, 2009 |accessdate=June 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Flegenheimer | first= Matt | url = http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/25/pondering-a-carlin-street-and-keeping-the-7-words-in-check/ | title = Carlin Street' Resisted by His Old Church.

He briefly attended [[Bishop Dubois High School]] in Harlem and the [[Salesians of Don Bosco|Salesian]] High School in Goshen, New York.&lt;ref name=Gonzalez&gt;{{cite news |first=David |last=Gonzalez |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/24/nyregion/24hayes.html |title=George Carlin Didn't Shun School That Ejected Him |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=June 24, 2008 |accessdate=June 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spent many summers at Camp Notre Dame on [[Spofford Lake]] in [[Spofford, New Hampshire]]. He regularly won the camp's drama award. Much later in life, he requested that after his death, a portion of his ashes be spread at the lake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhtourguide.com/nh_facts.htm |title=Interesting, Strange &amp; Weird New Hampshire Facts |publisher=NHTourGuide.com |accessdate=June 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carlin joined the [[United States Air Force]] and trained as a [[radar]] technician. He was stationed at [[Barksdale Air Force Base]] in [[Bossier City, Louisiana]]. He also began working as a disc jockey at radio station KJOE, in nearby [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]]. Labeled an "unproductive airman" by his superiors, Carlin received a general discharge on July 29, 1957. During his time in the Air Force, he had been [[court-martial]]ed three times, and also received many nonjudicial punishments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2008/film/news/comedian-george-carlin-dies-at-71-1117987925/ |title=Comedian George Carlin dies at 71 |publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=June 22, 2008 |accessdate=June 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
[[File:George Carlin Buddy Greco Away We Go 1967.JPG|thumb|right|180px|Carlin (right) with singer [[Buddy Greco]] in ''Away We Go'' (1967)]]
In 1959, Carlin met [[Jack Burns]], a fellow DJ at radio station [[KMNY|KXOL]] in [[Fort Worth, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.texasradiohalloffame.com/georgecarlin.html|title=Texas Radio Hall of Fame: George Carlin |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040923044145/http://www.texasradiohalloffame.com/georgecarlin.html |archivedate=September 23, 2004 |accessdate=June 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They formed a comedy team and after successful performances at Fort Worth's [[Beat Generation|beat]] coffeehouse called The Cellar, Burns and Carlin headed for California in February 1960.&lt;ref name="james7"/&gt;

Within weeks of arriving in California, Burns and Carlin put together an audition tape and created ''The Wright Brothers'', a morning show on [[KDAY]] in Hollywood. During their tenure at KDAY, they honed their material in [[beatnik]] coffeehouses at night.&lt;ref name=bio60s&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.georgecarlin.com/time/time3B.html |title=Timeline – 1960s |work=George Carlin Biography |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000621020616/http://www.georgecarlin.com/time/time3B.html |archivedate=June 21, 2000 |accessdate=June 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Years later when he was honored with a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]], Carlin requested that it be placed in front of the KDAY studios near the corner of Sunset Boulevard and Vine Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kennedy-center.org/calendar/index.cfm?fuseaction=showIndividual&amp;entity_id=19830&amp;source_type=A|title=Biographical information for George Carlin|publisher=Kennedy Center|date=|accessdate=July 30, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220184243/http://kennedy-center.org/calendar/index.cfm?fuseaction=showIndividual&amp;entity_id=19830&amp;source_type=A|archivedate=February 20, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burns and Carlin recorded their only album, ''[[Burns and Carlin at the Playboy Club Tonight]]'', in May 1960 at Cosmo Alley in Hollywood.&lt;ref name=bio60s /&gt; After two years together as a team, they parted to pursue individual careers, but "remain[ed] the best of friends."&lt;ref&gt;Carlin, George (2009). Last Words. New York: Free Press, pp. 47–8. {{ISBN|1-4391-7295-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, Carlin began appearing on television variety shows, where he played various characters:&lt;ref name=timeline /&gt;
* The Indian Sergeant&amp;nbsp;– "There will be a rain dance tonight ... weather permitting ..."
* Stupid disc jockeys ("Wonderful WINO radio...")&amp;nbsp;– "The Beatles' latest record, when played backwards at slow speed, says, 'Dummy! You're playing it backwards at slow speed!'"
* Al Sleet, the Hippie-Dippie Weatherman&amp;nbsp;– "Tonight's forecast: Dark. Continued mostly dark tonight, changing to widely scattered light towards morning."

Variations on these routines appear on Carlin's 1967 debut album, ''[[Take-Offs and Put-Ons]]'', which was recorded live in 1966 at The Roostertail in [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]] and issued by [[RCA Victor]] in 1967.&lt;ref name=timeline&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.georgecarlin.com/home/home.html |title=George Carlin's official site (see Timeline) |publisher=Georgecarlin.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091008001351/http://www.georgecarlin.com/home/home.html |archivedate=October 8, 2009 |accessdate=June 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:George Carlin 1969.JPG|thumb|right|George Carlin in 1969]]
During this period, Carlin became a frequent performer and guest host on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'', initially with [[Jack Paar]] as host, then with [[Johnny Carson]]. Carlin became one of Carson's most frequent substitutes during the host's three-decade reign. Carlin was also cast in ''Away We Go'', a 1967 comedy show that aired on CBS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061235/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast | title=Away We Go (1967– ) Full Cast &amp; Crew | website=IMDb | access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His material during his early career and his appearance, which consisted of suits and short-cropped hair, had been seen as "conventional", particularly when contrasted with his later [[anti-establishment]] material.&lt;ref&gt;''[[ABC World News Tonight]]''; June 23, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Carlin was present at [[Lenny Bruce]]'s arrest for obscenity. As the police began attempting to detain members of the audience for questioning, they asked Carlin for his identification. Telling the police he did not believe in government-issued IDs, he was arrested and taken to jail with Bruce in the same vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Profanity|episodelink=List of Bullshit! episodes|series=Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit!|serieslink=Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit!|network=[[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]]|airdate=August 12, 2004|season=2|number=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1960s, Carlin was making about $250,000 annually.&lt;ref name=Zoglin/&gt; As a [[tax shelter]] he bought a private jet&amp;nbsp;– a twin-engine [[IAI Westwind|Aero Commander 1121 Jet Commander]]. Carlin hired pilots to fly him to various tour dates.&lt;ref name=Jet&gt;{{Cite book |title=Last Words |last=Carlin |first=George |author2=[[Tony Hendra]] |year=2009 |publisher=[[Free Press (publisher)|Free Press]] |isbn=978-1-4391-7295-7 |page=151 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AEZ42cO2QboC&amp;pg=PT151 |accessdate=June 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:George Carlin In concert at the Zembo Mosque, Harrisburg, Pa.jpg|thumb|left|George Carlin in concert at [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]]]]
Eventually, Carlin changed his routines and his appearance. Carlin hired talent managers – Jeff Wald and Ron De Blasio – to help him reinvent his image, making him look more [[Hip (slang)|hip]] for a younger audience. Wald put Carlin into much smaller clubs such as [[The Troubadour, West Hollywood|The Troubadour]] in West Hollywood and [[The Bitter End]] in New York City. Wald says that Carlin's income was thus reduced by 90%, but his later career arc was greatly improved.&lt;ref name=Zoglin&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6xg1h5lBheQC&amp;pg=PT34 |pages=34–35 |last=Zoglin |first=Richard |title=Comedy at the Edge: How Stand-up in the 1970s Changed America |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |year=2008 |isbn=9781596919440 |accessdate=June 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970, record producer [[Monte Kay]] formed the [[Little David Records]] subsidiary of Atlantic Records, with comedian [[Flip Wilson]] as co-owner.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan 2010, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; Kay and Wilson signed Carlin away from RCA Records, and recorded a Carlin performance at [[Washington, D.C.]]'s [[The Cellar Door]] in May 1971—this was released as ''[[FM &amp; AM]]'' in January 1972. De Blasio was busy managing the fast-paced career of [[Freddie Prinze]], and was about to sign [[Richard Pryor]], so he released Carlin to Little David general manager Jack Lewis, who, like Carlin, was somewhat wild and rebellious.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan 2010, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; Carlin lost some TV bookings by dressing strangely for a comedian of the time, wearing faded jeans and sporting long hair, a beard, and earrings at a time when clean-cut, well-dressed comedians were the norm. Using his own persona as a springboard for his new comedy, he was presented by [[Ed Sullivan]] in a performance of "The Hair Piece" and quickly regained his popularity as the public caught on to his sense of style.&lt;ref name="GoldmarkBio"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goldmark|first1=Tony|title=George Carlin – Biography|url=http://www.amoeba.com/george-carlin/artist/146678/bio|website=Amoeba Music|accessdate=September 1, 2016|quote=He bridged these two sides of his persona with 'The Hair Piece,' a whimsical poem about public aversion to long hair that he performed on Ed Sullivan, effectively reintroducing and reinventing himself to America. FM &amp; AM went Gold, got him a gig at Carnegie Hall, and won the Grammy award for Best Comedy Album.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 1972, singer-songwriter [[Kenny Rankin]] was Carlin's label mate on Little David Records, and Rankin served many times as Carlin's musical guest or opening act during the early 1970s. The two flew together in Carlin's private jet; Carlin says that Rankin relapsed into using cocaine while on tour since Carlin had so much of the drug available.&lt;ref name=Jet/&gt;

The album ''[[FM &amp; AM]]'' proved very popular. It marked Carlin's change from mainstream to counterculture comedy. The "AM" side was an extension of Carlin's previous style, with zany but relatively clean routines parodying aspects of American life. The "FM" side introduced Carlin's new style, with references to marijuana and birth control pills, and a playful examination of the word "shit." In this manner, Carlin renewed a style of radical social commentary comedy that Lenny Bruce had pioneered in the late 1950s.&lt;ref name=Zoglin/&gt;

In this period Carlin perfected his well-known routine, "[[Seven dirty words|Seven Words You Can Never Say on Television]]", recorded on ''[[Class Clown]]''. On July 21, 1972, Carlin was arrested after performing this routine at [[Milwaukee]]'s [[Summerfest]] and charged with violating [[obscenity]] laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=626471|title=Carlin's naughty words still ring in officer's ears|author=Jim Stingl|publisher=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]|date=June 30, 2007|accessdate=March 23, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929124942/http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=626471|archivedate=September 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case, which prompted Carlin to refer to the words for a time as "the Milwaukee Seven", was dismissed in December of that year; the judge declared that the language was indecent but Carlin had the freedom to say it as long as he caused no disturbance. In 1973, a man complained to the [[Federal Communications Commission]] after listening with his son to a similar routine, "Filthy Words", from ''[[Occupation: Foole]]'', broadcast one afternoon over [[WBAI]], a [[Pacifica Foundation]] FM radio station in New York City. Pacifica received a citation from the FCC for violating regulations that prohibit broadcasting "obscene" material. The [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] upheld the FCC action by a vote of 5 to 4, ruling that the routine was "indecent but not obscene" and that the FCC had authority to prohibit such broadcasts during hours when children were likely to be among the audience (''[[F.C.C. v. Pacifica Foundation]]'', 438 U.S. 726 (1978); the court documents contain a complete transcript of the routine).&lt;ref name="EFF"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://w2.eff.org/legal/cases/FCC_v_Pacifica/fcc_v_pacifica.decision |title=FCC vs. Pacifica Foundation |date=July 3, 1978 |publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] |accessdate=June 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The controversy increased Carlin's fame. He eventually expanded the dirty-words theme with a seemingly interminable end to a performance (ending with his voice fading out in one HBO version, and accompanying the credits in the ''[[Carlin at Carnegie]]'' special for the 1982–83 season) and a set of 49 web pages organized by subject and embracing his "Incomplete List of Impolite Words."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.georgecarlin.com/dirty/2443.html |title=BBS – Incomplete List of Impolite Words |publisher=George Carlin |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406052624/http://www.georgecarlin.com/dirty/2443.html |archivedate=April 6, 2012 |accessdate=June 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On stage, during a rendition of his "Dirty Words" routine, Carlin learned that his previous comedy album ''FM &amp; AM'' had won the Grammy. Midway through the performance on the album ''Occupation: Foole'', he can be heard thanking someone for handing him a piece of paper. He then exclaimed "Shit!" and proudly announced his win to the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55pfcmUzGhw#t=2355 |title=George Carlin – Occupation: Foole}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carlin hosted the premiere broadcast of [[NBC]]'s ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', on October 11, 1975, the only episode to date in which the host did not appear (at his request) in sketches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Geoffrey Hammill, The Museum of Broadcast Communications |url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/S/htmlS/saturdaynigh/saturdaynigh.htm |title=Saturday Night Live |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020820194836/http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/S/htmlS/saturdaynigh/saturdaynigh.htm |archivedate=August 20, 2002 |accessdate=June 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following season, 1976–77, he appeared regularly on [[CBS]] Television's ''[[Tony Orlando &amp; Dawn]]'' variety series.&lt;ref name="TVGuideTonyOrlandoAndDawn"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tony Orlando and Dawn 1974 TV SHOW|url=http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/tony-orlando-and-dawn/cast/205090/|website=TVGuide.com|accessdate=September 1, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160901182949/http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/tony-orlando-and-dawn/cast/205090/|archivedate=September 1, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carlin unexpectedly stopped performing regularly in 1976, when his career appeared to be at its height. For the next five years he rarely performed stand-up, although it was at this time that he began doing specials for HBO as part of its ''[[On Location (TV series)|On Location]]'' series; doing 14 specials, including 2008's ''It's Bad For Ya!''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biography.com/people/george-carlin-9542307#comic-great |title=George Carlin stand up comedian does 14 specials for On Location |last= |first= |date= |publisher=[[Biography.com]] ([[FYI (TV network)|FYI]] / [[A&amp;E Networks]]) |accessdate= October 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later revealed that he had suffered the first of three [[myocardial infarction|heart attacks]] during this layoff period.&lt;ref name="bravo"&gt;{{cite episode|title=George Carlin|series=Inside the Actors Studio|serieslink=Inside the Actors Studio|network=[[Bravo (US TV channel)|Bravo TV]]|airdate=October 31, 2004|season=11|number=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first two HBO specials aired in 1977 and 1978.&lt;ref name="EssSplitsider2015"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ess|first1=Ramsey|title=How George Carlin Changed comedy In His First HBO Special|url=http://splitsider.com/2015/04/how-george-carlin-changed-comedy-in-his-first-hbo-special/|website=Splitsider.com|accessdate=September 1, 2016|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160617094322/http://splitsider.com/2015/04/how-george-carlin-changed-comedy-in-his-first-hbo-special/|archivedate=June 17, 2016 |date=April 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LeveretteOttBuckley2009"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leverette|first1=Marc|last2=Ott|first2=Brian L|last3=Buckley|first3=Cara Louise|title=It's Not TV: Watching HBO in the Post-Television Era|date=March 23, 2009|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135902742|page=128|url=https://www.routledge.com/Its-Not-TV-Watching-HBO-in-the-Post-Television-Era/Leverette-Ott-Buckley/p/book/9780415960380|accessdate=September 1, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160901182100/https://www.routledge.com/Its-Not-TV-Watching-HBO-in-the-Post-Television-Era/Leverette-Ott-Buckley/p/book/9780415960380|archivedate=September 1, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Loz carlinbd2.jpg|thumb|George Carlin at a book signing for ''[[Brain Droppings]]'' in [[New York City]] at [[Barnes &amp; Noble]]]]
In 1981, Carlin returned to the stage, releasing ''[[A Place for My Stuff]]'' and returning to HBO and New York City with the ''[[Carlin at Carnegie]]'' TV special, videotaped at [[Carnegie Hall]] and airing during the 1982–83 season. Carlin continued doing HBO specials every year or every other year over the following decade and a half. All of Carlin's albums from this time forward are from the HBO specials.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

He hosted ''SNL'' for the second time on November 10, 1984, this time appearing in several sketches.&lt;ref name="NBCSNL11101984"&gt;{{cite web|title=MONOLOGUE: GEORGE CARLIN RETURNS TO HOST SNL|url=http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/george-carlin-monologue/n9279|website=NBC.com|accessdate=September 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carlin began to achieve prominence as a film actor with a major supporting role in the 1987 comedy hit ''[[Outrageous Fortune (film)|Outrageous Fortune]]'', starring [[Bette Midler]] and [[Shelley Long]]; it was his first notable screen role after a handful of previous guest roles on television series. Playing drifter Frank Madras, the role poked fun at the lingering effect of the [[1960s counterculture]]. In 1989, he gained popularity with a new generation of teens when he was cast as Rufus, the time-traveling mentor of the title characters in ''[[Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure]]'', and reprised his role in the film sequel ''[[Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey]]'' as well as the first season of the [[Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventures (1990 TV series)|cartoon series]]. He also played the role of "Mr Conductor" on the [[PBS]] show ''[[Shining Time Station]]'' and narrated the show's sequences of the American version of ''[[Thomas the Tank Engine &amp; Friends]]'' from 1991 to 1995, replacing [[Ringo Starr]]. On the first day of the assignment, Carlin was cross about recording his narration without an audience, so the producers put a stuffed teddy bear in the booth.&lt;ref name=LAT&gt;{{cite web|last=Allcroft |first=Britt |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/sunday/commentary/la-oew-allcroft26-2008jun26,0,3849505.story |title=Los Angeles Times – "The George Carlin I knew" |work=Los Angeles Times |date=26 June 2008 |accessdate=5 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1991, Carlin had a major supporting role in the movie ''[[The Prince of Tides]]'', which starred [[Nick Nolte]] and [[Barbra Streisand]], portraying the gay neighbor of the main character's suicidal sister.&lt;ref name="Grimes1992"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Grimes|first1=William|authorlink=William Grimes (journalist)|title=George Carlin, Small but Amusing|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/21/news/george-carlin-small-but-amusing.html|website=New York Times|accessdate=September 1, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150526055649/http://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/21/news/george-carlin-small-but-amusing.html|archivedate=May 26, 2015 |date=January 21, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, Carlin began a weekly [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] sitcom, ''[[The George Carlin Show]]'', playing New York City [[taxicab]] driver George O'Grady. &lt;!--He quickly included a variation of the "seven words" in the plot.--&gt; The show, created and written by ''[[The Simpsons]]'' co-creator [[Sam Simon]], ran 27 episodes through December 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.georgecarlin.com/time/time3E.html |title=1990–1999 |publisher=GeorgeCarlin.com |date= |accessdate=July 30, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130011335/http://www.georgecarlin.com/time/time3E.html |archivedate=January 30, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his final book, the posthumously published ''[[Last Words (book)|Last Words]]'', Carlin said about ''The George Carlin Show'', "I had a great time. I never laughed so much, so often, so hard as I did with cast members [[Alex Rocco]], [[Christopher Rich (actor)|Chris Rich]], [[Anthony Starke|Tony Starke]]. There was a very strange, very good sense of humor on that stage ... [but] I was incredibly happy when the show was canceled. I was frustrated that it had taken me away from my true work."&lt;ref&gt;''Last Words'', Simon &amp; Schuster, 2009'&lt;/ref&gt;

Carlin later explained that there were other, more pragmatic reasons for abandoning his acting career in favor of standup. In an interview for [[Esquire (magazine)|''Esquire'']] magazine in 2001, he said, "Because of my abuse of drugs, I neglected my business affairs and had large arrears with the IRS, and that took me eighteen to twenty years to dig out of. I did it honorably, and I don't begrudge them. I don't hate paying taxes, and I'm not angry at anyone, because I was complicit in it. But I'll tell you what it did for me: it made me a way better comedian. Because I had to stay out on the road and I couldn't pursue that movie career, which would have gone nowhere, and I became a really good comic and a really good writer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esquire.com/features/what-ive-learned/george-carlin-quotes-0102 |title=What I've Learned: George Carlin |publisher=Esquire.com |date=June 23, 2008 |author=Larry Getlen |accessdate=June 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carlin was honored at the 1997 [[Aspen Comedy Festival]] with a retrospective, ''[[George Carlin: 40 Years of Comedy]]'', hosted by [[Jon Stewart]]. His first hardcover book, ''[[Brain Droppings]]'' (1997), sold nearly 900,000 copies and spent 40 weeks on the ''[[New York Times]]'' best-seller list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kennedy-center.org/explorer/artists/?entity_id=19830|title=The Kennedy Center|accessdate=June 12, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224111638/http://www.kennedy-center.org/explorer/artists/?entity_id=19830|archivedate=December 24, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Carlin was given a [[Lifetime Achievement Award]] at the 15th Annual [[American Comedy Awards]].
In December 2003 Representative [[Doug Ose]] (R-California) introduced a bill (H.R. 3687) to outlaw the broadcast of Carlin's "seven dirty words",&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/108th-congress/house-bill/3687|title=H.R.3687 - To amend section 1464 of title 18, United States Code, to provide for the punishment of certain profane broadcasts, and for other purposes.|last=|first=|date=December 8, 2003|website=congress.gov|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; including "compound use (including hyphenated compounds) of such words and phrases with each other or with other words or phrases, and other grammatical forms of such words and phrases (including verb, adjective, gerund, participle, and infinitive forms)." The bill omitted "tits", but included "asshole", which was not one of Carlin's original seven words. The bill was referred to the [[United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties|House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution]] in January 2004, where it was tabled.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Carlin performed regularly as a headliner in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], but in 2004 his run at the [[MGM Grand Las Vegas]] was terminated after an altercation with his audience. After a poorly received set, filled with dark references to suicide bombings and beheadings, Carlin complained that he could not wait to get out of "this fucking hotel" and Las Vegas; he wanted to go back east, he said, "where the real people are." He continued:
{{quotation|People who go to Las Vegas, you've got to question their fucking intellect to start with. Traveling hundreds and thousands of miles to essentially give your money to a large corporation is kind of fucking moronic. That's what I'm always getting here is these kind of fucking people with very limited intellects.}}
When an audience member shouted "Stop degrading us!" Carlin responded "Thank you very much, whatever that was. I hope it was positive; if not, well, blow me." He was immediately fired, and soon thereafter his representative announced that he would begin treatment for alcohol and prescription painkiller addiction on his own initiative.&lt;ref name="tagreviewj"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2004/Dec-04-Sat-2004/news/25407915.html |title=Dark Carlin |publisher=reviewjournal.com |date=December 4, 2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041207042940/http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2004/Dec-04-Sat-2004/news/25407915.html |archivedate=December 7, 2004 |accessdate=June 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/SHOWBIZ/books/12/27/george.carlin/index.html?_s=PM:SHOWBIZ |title=George Carlin enters rehab |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=December 29, 2004 |accessdate=June 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Topics included suicide, [[natural disaster]]s, [[cannibalism]], [[genocide]], [[human sacrifice]], threats to [[civil liberties]] in the U.S., and the case for his theory that humans are inferior to other animals. At the first tour stop at the Tachi Palace Casino in [[Lemoore, California]] in February, Carlin mentioned that the appearance was his "first show back" after a six-week hospitalization for heart failure and [[pneumonia]].{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Carlin voiced a character in the 2006 [[Disney]]/[[Pixar]] animated feature ''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]''. The character, Fillmore, is an anti-establishment hippie [[VW Microbus]] with a [[psychedelic art|psychedelic]] paint job and the license plate "51237"&amp;nbsp;– Carlin's birthday. In 2007, Carlin voiced the wizard in ''[[Happily N'Ever After]]'', his last film.

Carlin's last HBO stand-up special, ''[[It's Bad for Ya]]'', aired live on March 1, 2008, from the [[Wells Fargo Center for the Arts]] in [[Santa Rosa, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/movies/dvd/2007-09-24-carlin-collection_N.htm |title=George Carlin reflects on 50 years (or so) of 'All My Stuff' |author=Wloszczyna, Susan |publisher=[[USA Today]] |date=September 24, 2007 |accessdate=June 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Themes included "American bullshit", rights, death, old age, and child rearing.

When asked on ''[[Inside the Actors Studio]]'' what turned him on, he responded, "Reading about language." When asked what made him proudest of his career, he said the number of his books that have been sold, close to a million copies.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

== Personal life ==
Carlin met Brenda Hosbrook in August 1960 while touring with Burns and Carlin in [[Dayton, Ohio]]. They were married at her parents' home in Dayton on June 3, 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Last Words |last=Carlin |first=George |author2=[[Tony Hendra]] |year=2009 |publisher=[[Free Press (publisher)|Free Press]] |isbn=978-1-4391-7295-7 |pages=89–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple's only child, [[Kelly Carlin|Kelly]], was born on June 15, 1963.

In November 1997, Carlin met Sally Wade, a comedy writer based in Hollywood; Carlin described it as "love at first sight", but was hesitant to act on his feelings so soon after his wife's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Last Words |last=Carlin |first=George |author2=[[Tony Hendra]] |year=2009 |publisher=[[Free Press (publisher)|Free Press]] |isbn=978-1-4391-7295-7 |pages=272}}&lt;/ref&gt; They eventually married on June 24, 1998, in a private, unregistered ceremony.

Carlin also criticized religion and mocked traditional oath affirmations on the Bible as "bullshit", "make believe", and "kid stuff".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Religion is bullshit |author=George Carlin |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RT6rL2UroE |work=YouTube |format=video |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016214138/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RT6rL2UroE |archivedate=October 16, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he warned, "Be happy, don't be proud, there's too much pride as it is.

==Death==
Carlin had a history of cardiac problems spanning three decades. These included three heart attacks (in 1978, 1982, and 1991), an [[Heart arrhythmia|arrhythmia]] requiring an [[Ablation of atrial fibrillation|ablation]] procedure in 2003, and a significant episode of heart failure in late 2005.

For a number of years, Carlin had been compiling and writing his autobiography, to be released in conjunction with a one-man Broadway show tentatively titled ''New York City Boy''.

The book, chronicling most of Carlin's life and future plans, including the one-man show, was published in 2009. The audio edition is narrated by Carlin's brother, Patrick Jr.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Deahl |first=Rachel |title=Free Press Acquires Posthumous Carlin Memoir |newspaper=[[Publishers Weekly]] |date=July 14, 2009 |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6670970.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090716142423/http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6670970.html |archivedate=July 16, 2009 |accessdate=June 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Internet hoaxes ==
Many writings found on the internet have been falsely attributed to Carlin, including various joke lists, rants, and other pieces. The web site [[Snopes]], an online resource that debunks [[urban legend]]s and myths, has addressed these hoaxes. Many of them contain material that runs counter to Carlin's viewpoints; some are especially volatile toward racial groups, gays, women, the homeless, and other targets. Carlin was aware of these bogus emails and debunked them on his own web site, saying, "Here's a rule of thumb, folks: Nothing you see on the Internet is mine unless it comes from one of my albums, books, HBO specials, or appeared on my web site", and "It bothers me that some people might believe that I would be capable of writing some of this stuff." [[Weird Al Yankovic]] referenced these hoaxes in a line of his song "[[Alpocalypse#Track listing|Stop Forwarding That Crap to Me]]" by saying "And by the way, those quotes from George Carlin aren't really George Carlin".&lt;ref&gt;
