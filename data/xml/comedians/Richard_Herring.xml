'''Richard Keith Herring''' (born 12 July 1967) is an English [[stand-up comedian]], comedy writer, podcaster and diarist whose early work includes the comedy [[double act]] [[Lee and Herring]]. He is described by ''[[The British Theatre Guide]]'' as "one of the leading hidden masters of modern British comedy".&lt;ref name="britishtheatreguide.info"&gt;[http://www.britishtheatreguide.info/otherresources/fringe/fringe08-83.htm Reviews from the 2008 Edinburgh Fringe (83)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the end of the double act, Herring also worked as a writer, producing four plays. After Lee and Herring went their separate ways he co-wrote the sitcom ''[[Time Gentlemen Please]]'', but quickly returned to performance with [[high-concept|concept-driven]] [[one-person show]]s like ''[[Talking Cock (comedy show)|Talking Cock]]'', ''Hitler Moustache'' and ''Christ on a Bike'' as well as regular circuit stand-up. Herring has created thirteen of these stand-up shows since 2004, performing them for eleven consecutive years at the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]], with annual tours and a final performance recorded for DVD. His 2016–17 show was a 'best of' tour, drawing from these shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yorkpress.co.uk/leisure/comedy/14648349.Review__Great_Yorkshire_Fringe__Richard_Herring__The_Best_____Preview__White_Rose_Rotunda__Parliament_Street__York__July_26k/ |title=Review: Great Yorkshire Fringe, Richard Herring, The Best – Preview, White Rose Rotunda, Parliament Street, York, July 26k|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 November 2013, he recorded the first episode of a six-part internet stand-up, sketch and interview show ''Richard Herring's Meaning of Life,'' structured around the philosophical concepts of 'Creation', 'the Paranormal', 'Love', 'Death', 'Good &amp; Evil' and 'the Shape of Things To Come',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thejohnfleming.wordpress.com/2014/01/19/why-comedian-richard-herring-thinks-creating-free-comedy-will-make-money/|title=Why comedian Richard Herring thinks creating free comedy will make money|work=SO IT GOES – John Fleming's blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thejohnfleming.wordpress.com/2014/01/21/comedian-richard-herring-on-financing-his-own-tv-series-and-an-alternative-to-losing-money-at-the-edinburgh-fringe/|title=Comedian Richard Herring on financing his own TV series and an alternative to losing money at the  Edinburgh Fringe|work=SO IT GOES – John Fleming's blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thejohnfleming.wordpress.com/2014/01/24/richard-herring-on-buying-back-his-own-tv-series-from-the-bbc-not-being-more-famous-and-regaining-happiness/|title=Richard Herring on buying back his own TV series from the BBC, not being more famous and regaining happiness|work=SO IT GOES – John Fleming's blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; the episode being broadcast online between February 2014 and early 2015.

In February 2014, the first ''Richard Herring Show'' was broadcast on [[Fubar Radio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fubarradio.com|title=Fubar Radio: UK uncensored radio|work=fubarradio.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Herring presented this with comedian [[Lou Sanders]] weekly, before quitting the show together; their final episode was broadcast on 24 May 2014.

On 8 March 2018, in aid of [[International Women’s Day]], Richard raised over £100,000 for domestic abuse charity Refuge by responding to anyone on Twitter who asked when [[International Men's Day]] was (it is November 19th).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/comedian-replies-to-every-person-asking-when-is-international-mens-day-on-twitter-a3785081.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Motifs and tropes ==
* Misspelling words for comic effect, most commonly by adding a superfluous 's' (as in '[[John Major]]s') or 'g' (as in '[[skeleton|skellington]]')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/feb/03/richard-herring-funniest-things|title=Richard Herring: ‘Rick And Morty is the most brilliant TV show I've ever seen'|first=Rachel|last=Aroesti|date=3 February 2017|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Recurrence of the name [[Ian]] for characters, especially as a stand-in name for the imagined director of a company (as in 'Ian [[Starbucks]]').
* Unlikely [[acronyms]] (as in {{Smallcaps|{{lc:TMWRNJ}}}} for ''[[This Morning With Richard Not Judy]]'') and complex, self-defeating [[mnemonics]] (as in {{Smallcaps|{{lc:ABIA-IBJA-JBJAH-BAJ-BPA ZOT-APBEA-EBAAA-BAAA-BNANB-SASB-BORA-BBOORA-OBJA-JBDT-KADT-KBSOH-THBTWO-UAS-BRA-RBAAA-BAAA-BJAJ BJAJ-BOA-OBJA-JBAAA-BEA-EBMAM-BAAA-BJA-JBJAH-BATT-TWCAT-BAATWB-TBJBS-ASBZAZ-BAAA-BEAEBAAABS-AS-BAAA-BEAEBEA-EBMAM-JAJ-BJ-THOMOW-WBJ-WICC}}}} for [[Matthew 1|the genealogy of Christ]].)
