She is best known for starring as [[Trudy Wiegel]] on [[Comedy Central]]'s mockumentary series ''[[Reno 911!]]'' and previously for her sketch comedy work on [[MTV]]'s ''[[The State (1993 TV series)|The State]]'', where she was the show's lone female cast member. She has also appeared with recurring roles on sitcoms such as ''[[Superstore (TV series)|Superstore]]'', ''[[2 Broke Girls]]'', ''[[Love (TV series)|Love]]'', and ''[[The Ellen Show]]''. In the mid-late 1990's, Kenney fronted the all-female rock band [[Cake Like]].

==Early life==
Kenney-Silver was born '''Kerri Kenney''' in [[Westport, Connecticut]], the daughter of Sharon (McGaughey) and [[Larry Kenney]], an actor who is known for his classic [[voice over]] work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/88/Kerri-Kenney.html |title=Kerri Kenney Biography (1970–) |publisher=Filmreference.com |date=1970-01-20 |accessdate=2012-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has a sister, Ashley, and a brother, Tanner.

==Career==
During the early 1990s, Kenney-Silver was the lead singer and bass guitarist of the [[indie rock]] band [[Cake Like]].

Kenney-Silver attended [[NYU]] where she joined the sketch comedy group ''The New Group''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stulce|first=Corey|title=The Union of The State|pages=56–57|year=2016|ISBN=978-0997400519}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="15things"&gt;{{cite web|title=15 Things You Might Not Know About 'The State'|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/57562/15-things-you-might-not-know-about-state|publisher=[[Mental Floss]]|date=July 10, 2014 |accessdate=August 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which ultimately became ''The State''.&lt;ref name="avclub"&gt;{{cite web|title=The State's David Wain, Thomas Lennon and Kerri Kenney-Silver|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/the-states-david-wain-thomas-lennon-and-kerri-kenn-23385|publisher=[[The A.V. Club]]|date=February 4, 2009|accessdate=August 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group was picked up for a self-titled sketch comedy show on MTV, ''[[The State (1993 TV series)|The State]]'',&lt;ref name="15things"/&gt; which aired between 1993 and 1995. 

After the show's completion, Kenney-Silver continued working with her fellow troupe members on other projects. In 1996, she co-wrote and starred in ''[[Viva Variety]]'', a parody of variety shows that aired on [[Comedy Central]] for two seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://splitsider.com/2014/09/revisiting-the-surreal-world-of-viva-variety/|title=Revisiting the Surreal World of ‘Viva Variety’|publisher=SplitSider|date=September 26, 2014|accessdate=August 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Orpheus RENO 911 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Kenney-Silver in character with ''Reno 911!'' co-star Thomas Lennon at Mardi Gras, 2009]]
In 2000, Kenney-Silver voiced the character of "Gravitina" in the children's cartoon ''[[Buzz Lightyear of Star Command]]''. She has since done a number of voices on the [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]] series ''[[Invader Zim]]''. Additionally, she was cast as a regular on ''[[The Ellen Show]]'', which aired until 2001. She later found success with ''[[Reno 911!]]'',&lt;ref name="avclub"/&gt; a series on [[Comedy Central]] that parodied police reality shows like ''[[Cops (TV series)|COPS]]'', which also featured former members of the State, [[Thomas Lennon (actor)|Thomas Lennon]], [[Ben Garant]], and [[Joe Lo Truglio]]. The show was cancelled in 2009 after six seasons. Kenney-Silver also appeared on the TV series ''[[Still Standing (TV series)|Still Standing]]''.

In July 2008, Kenney-Silver made her debut as "Dame Delilah", the title character in the [[web series]] ''Dame Delilah's Fantasy Ranch &amp; Gift Shoppe''. On the site, various comedians give video testimony as characters working at or otherwise visiting the fictional Cat House. Kenney-Silver created the series and it was produced by her husband, Steve Silver, and Jared Mazzaschi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.damedelilah.com |title=Dame Delilah's Fantasy Ranch &amp; Gift Shoppe |publisher=Damedelilah.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kenney-Silver was among the cast of ''Suburban Shootout'', a pilot episode directed and executive produced by [[Barry Sonnenfeld]] for [[HBO]]. The pilot filmed in [[The Hamptons]], [[Long Island]], in September 2008. HBO has not announced if it will pick up the pilot for a season. The pilot is based on the [[British comedy]] [[Suburban Shootout|of the same name]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.27east.com/story_detail.cfm?id=170793 |title=Hamptons familiar location for director |publisher=27east |date= |accessdate=2012-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kenney-Silver has appeared in films such as ''[[All About Steve]]'', ''[[Reno 911!: Miami]]'', ''[[National Lampoon's Pledge This!]]'', ''[[Balls of Fury]]'', ''[[The Ten]]'', ''[[Role Models]]'', and ''[[Wanderlust (2012 film)|Wanderlust]]''.

In December 2011 it was announced that Kenney-Silver and actress [[Jamie Denbo]] are developing a new series for [[Comedy Central]] called "Dame Delilah’s Rabbit Hole Ranch" based on a web series they previously created and starred in.

In March 2012 it was announced Kenney-Silver had been cast a lead role in the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] comedy pilot ''[[Counter Culture (TV series)|Counter Culture]]'' about three aging sisters (Kenney, [[Delta Burke]] and [[Margo Martindale]]) running their family diner together in [[West Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Nellie Andreeva |url=http://www.deadline.com/2012/03/reno-911-alum-kerri-kenney-lands-a-lead-in-abc-comedy-pilot-counter-culture/|title=‘Reno 911′ Alum Kerri Kenney Lands A Lead In ABC Comedy Pilot ‘Counter Culture’|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=March 17, 2012|accessdate=April 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pilot was not picked up for production by ABC.

In 2015 she began voicing the character of Miriam in the ''[[Nickelodeon]]'' series ''[[Harvey Beaks]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chgreenblatt.tumblr.com/post/109468744982/could-you-at-least-tell-me-the-voice-actors-for|title=Nerd Armada|publisher=C.H. Greenblatt|date= January 29, 2015 |accessdate=January 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2016 to 2018, she recurred as Syd (the neighbor of [[Gillian Jacobs]]) in the [[Netflix]] comedy series ''[[Love (TV series)|Love]]''.
