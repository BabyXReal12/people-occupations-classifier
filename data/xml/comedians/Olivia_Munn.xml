She has gone on to say that she disliked the experience, explaining, "I was trying to be something I wasn't, and that made me really uncomfortable on live TV."&lt;ref name="G4"/&gt;
Soon after she moved to Los Angeles, Munn was cast in a small role in the [[direct-to-video]] [[horror film]] ''[[Scarecrow Gone Wild]]''. She appeared in rock band [[Zebrahead]]'s music video for their song "Hello Tomorrow" as the love interest of the lead singer [[Justin Mauriello]].&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|Epe2dfFwSVo|Olivia Munn in Zebrahead Music Video}}
