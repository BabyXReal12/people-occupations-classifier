'''Christopher Crosby Farley''' (February 15, 1964&amp;nbsp;– December 18, 1997) was an American actor and comedian. Farley was known for his loud, energetic comedic style, and was a member of [[Chicago]]'s [[The Second City|Second City Theatre]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.secondcity.com/?id=history/alumni/chicago |title=Chicago Alumni |publisher=The Second City |accessdate=2010-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later a [[Saturday Night Live cast|cast member]] of the [[NBC]] [[sketch comedy]] show ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' between 1990 and 1995.&lt;ref name="yahoo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="whs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/highlights/archives/2008/05/farley_exhibit.asp|title=Wisconsin Historical Society|publisher=Wisconsinhistory.org|accessdate=2010-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then went on to pursue a film career, starring in films such as ''[[Tommy Boy]]'', ''[[Black Sheep (1996 film)|Black Sheep]]'' and ''[[Beverly Hills Ninja]]''. Farley died of a [[drug overdose]]  at the age of 33

==Early life==
Farley was born on February 15, 1964, in [[Madison, Wisconsin]]. His father, Thomas John Farley Sr. (1936–1999), owned an oil company, and his mother, Mary Anne (née Crosby), was a homemaker.&lt;ref name="yahoo"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800018622/bio|title=Chris Farley Biography&amp;nbsp;— Yahoo!

His cousin, [[Jim Farley (businessman)|Jim]], was Executive Vice President and President, Global Markets at [[Ford Motor Company|Ford Motor Company Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Greg|last=Gardner|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/freep/access/1793009141.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Jul+18%2C+2009&amp;author=GREG+GARDNER&amp;pub=Detroit+Free+Press&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=A.9&amp;desc=Rising+star+assigned+new+duties+at+Ford|title=Rising star assigned new duties at Ford|newspaper=[[Detroit Free Press]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|location=Detroit, Michigan|date=July 18, 2009|accessdate=September 4, 2011}} {{registration required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Bill|last=Vlasic|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/20/business/20ford.html?pagewanted=4&amp;n=Top/News/Business/Companies/Toyota%20Motor%20Corporation|title=A Star at Toyota, a Believer at Ford|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=New York Times Company|location=New York City|page=4|date=April 20, 2008|accessdate=June 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Farley's family is [[Roman Catholic]] and of Irish and Scottish descent. Farley attended Catholic schools in his hometown, including [[Edgewood High School of the Sacred Heart]]. According to [[Joel Murray]], a fellow Second City cast member, Farley would "always make it to Mass."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thechrisfarleyshow.com/chicago.html|title=Chris Farley|publisher=The Chris Farley Show|accessdate=September 4, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090424071147/http://www.thechrisfarleyshow.com/chicago.html|archivedate=April 24, 2009|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of his summers were spent as a camper and counselor at [[Red Arrow Camp]], near [[Minocqua, Wisconsin]]. He graduated from [[Marquette University]] in 1986, with a concentration in [[Communication studies|communications]] and [[theater]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marquette.edu/about/allfamous.shtml|title=Marquette University&amp;nbsp;— Famous Faces|publisher=Marquette.edu|date=February 12, 2003|accessdate=October 25, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130104220519/http://www.marquette.edu/about/allfamous.shtml|archivedate=January 4, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Marquette, he played rugby and discovered a love of comedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://marquettewire.org/3672803/tribune/tribune-news/tom-farley-addresses-brothers-addictions/|title=Tom Farley addresses brother’s addictions|last=Engel|first=Tom|work=[[Marquette Tribune]]|date=March 17, 2009|accessdate=October 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After college, he worked with his father at the Scotch Oil Company in Madison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/chris-farley-9542500|title=Chris Farley Biography|publisher=The Biography Channel|accessdate=October 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He got his start in professional comedy at the Ark Improv Theatre in Madison, and at the [[IO Theater|Improv Olympic]] theater in Chicago. He then performed at [[Chicago]]'s [[The Second City|Second City Theatre]], initially as part of Second City's touring group. He was eventually promoted to their Mainstage in 1989, and was a cast member of three revues: ''The Gods Must Be Lazy'', ''It Was Thirty Years Ago Today'', and ''Flag Smoking Permitted in Lobby Only or Censorama''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.secondcity.com/people/other/chris-farley/|title=Chris Farley|publisher=The Second City|accessdate=December 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===''Saturday Night Live''===
Along with [[Chris Rock]], Farley was one of the new ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' cast members announced in the spring of 1990.&lt;ref name="yahoo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="whs"/&gt; On ''SNL'', Farley frequently collaborated with fellow cast members [[Adam Sandler]], [[Chris Rock]], [[Rob Schneider]], and [[David Spade]], among others. This group came to be known as the "Bad Boys of SNL."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0500191/ |title=The Bad Boys of Saturday Night Live (1998) (TV)|website=IMDb.com|accessdate=June 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Popular characters performed by Farley included [[Matt Foley]], an over-the-top [[motivational speaker]] who constantly reminded other characters that he "lived in a van, down by the river." The name of the character was drawn from an actual friend of Farley who, during a troubled period, lived in a van near a river. The real Matt Foley later became a Catholic priest and appeared in the 2015 documentary ''I am Chris Farley''.

In early renditions of the character, Farley used other names, depending on whom he knew in the audience, until the real-life Foley went to the show and had his name used, at which point Farley felt the name best suited the character and refused to change it. Some of the mannerisms of the character were a combination of the positions Farley noticed his rugby teammates took on the pitch coupled with the angry and high-pitched, yet low volume/muffled voice his father used when he was angry.&lt;ref name="dada"&gt;{{cite news|first=Sam|last=Anderson|url=http://nymag.com/arts/books/reviews/47039|title=Dada’s Boy|work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|publisher=[[New York Media]]|location=New York City|date=May 16, 2008|accessdate=June 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other famous Farley characters included Todd O'Connor of [[Bill Swerski's Superfans]], a group of stereotypical Chicagoans who constantly shouted [[Chicago Bears|"da Bears!"]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/highlights/archives/2008/05/farley_exhibit.asp|title=New Exhibit: Chris Farley Remembered|publisher=Wisconsin Historical Society|accessdate=June 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Chippendale's dancers|Chippendale's dancer]], in a famous sketch that paired him with guest host [[Patrick Swayze]];&lt;ref name=cnn&gt;{{cite news|first=Henry|last=Goldblatt|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/SHOWBIZ/books/05/07/chris.farley|title='Chris Farley Show' stuffed with gossip|publisher=[[CNN]] |location=Atlanta, Georgia|date=May 7, 2008|accessdate=June 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the "[[Gap Girls]]", who hung out together at a local mall; a stereotypical [[lunch lady]], to the theme of ''Lunchlady Land'' performed by Adam Sandler;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Bill|last=Crawford|title=Adam Sandler: America's Comedian|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]]|location=New York City|date=2000|page=75|isbn=0-312-26282-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bennett Brauer]], a ''[[Weekend Update]]'' commentator who often divulged his personal and hygienic problems via [[air quotes]]; and himself on ''[[The Chris Farley Show]]'', a talk show in which Farley quite often "interviewed" the guest, regularly getting very nervous.

Some of these characters were brought to ''SNL'' from his days at Second City. Farley also performed impersonations of [[Tom Arnold (actor)|Tom Arnold]] (who gave Farley's eulogy at his private funeral), [[Andrew Giuliani]], [[Jerry Garcia]], [[Meat Loaf]], [[Norman Schwarzkopf, Jr.|Norman Schwarzkopf]], [[Dom DeLuise]], [[Roger Ebert]], [[Carnie Wilson]], [[Newt Gingrich]], [[Mindy Cohn]], [[Mama Cass]], [[Hank Williams Jr.]], and [[Rush Limbaugh]].&lt;ref name=wisconsin&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/museum/artifacts/archives/003176.asp|title=Chris Farley's Black Sheep Jacket|publisher=wisconsinhistory.org|accessdate=2008-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Off screen, Farley was well known for his pranks in the offices of ''Saturday Night Live''. Sandler and Farley would make late-night prank phone calls from the ''SNL'' offices in [[Rockefeller Center]], with Sandler speaking in an old woman's voice and Farley [[farting]] into the phone and [[mooning]] cars from a limousine, and even once [[defecation|defecating]] out a window. He was also known to frequently get naked and do various stunts for laughs. Chris Rock once claimed that he probably saw Farley's private parts more than Farley's girlfriend did.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nymag.com/arts/tv/features/47548/index6.html|title=Comedy Isn’t Funny|last=Smith|first=Chris|date=1995-03-15|publisher=New York|page=7|accessdate=2008-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shales T. and Miller J.A. (2002) ''Live From New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live''. New York, Back Bay Books, pp. 379–380&lt;/ref&gt; Sandler told [[Conan O'Brien]] on ''[[The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien|The Tonight Show]]'' that NBC fired him and Farley from the show in 1995.&lt;ref name="Sandler fired"&gt;[http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/2010/01/21/2010-01-21_youre_not_alone_conan_obrien_adam_sandler_says_nbc_fired_him_and_chris_farley_fr.html "You're not alone, Conan O'Brien: Adam Sandler says NBC fired him and Chris Farley from 'SNL{{'"}}] Joe Dziemianowicz, ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'' (New York), January 21, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film career===
During his time on ''SNL'', Farley appeared in the comedy films ''[[Wayne's World (film)|Wayne's World]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.houstonpress.com/arts/10-things-that-the-waynes-world-movies-gave-us-6396262|title=10 Things That the Wayne's World Movies Gave Us|last=Hlavaty|first=Craig|work=[[Houston Press]]|date=2012-02-17|accessdate=2016-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Coneheads (film)|Coneheads]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/coneheadspghowe_a0afe0.htm|title=''Coneheads''|last=Howe|first=Desson|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=1993-07-23|accessdate=2016-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Airheads]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9501E5DA1031F936A3575BC0A962958260|title=FILM REVIEW; 'Airheads.'

After Farley and most of his fellow cast members were released from their contracts at ''Saturday Night Live'' following the [[Saturday Night Live (season 20)|1994–1995 season]], Farley began focusing on his film career. His first two major films co starred his fellow ''SNL'' colleague and close friend [[David Spade]]. Together, the duo made the films ''[[Tommy Boy (film)|Tommy Boy]]'' and ''[[Black Sheep (1996 film)|Black Sheep]]''. These were a success at the domestic [[box office]], earning around $32 million each and gaining a large [[cult following]] on [[home video]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=blacksheep.htm|title=Box Office Mojo data for '&amp;#39;Black Sheep'&amp;#39;|publisher=Boxofficemojo.com|date=1996-03-15|accessdate=2010-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=tommyboy.htm|title=Box Office Mojo data for '&amp;#39;Tommy Boy'&amp;#39;|publisher=Boxofficemojo.com|date=1995-05-16|accessdate=2010-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two films established Farley as a relatively [[bankable star]] and he was given the title role of ''[[Beverly Hills Ninja]]'', which finished in first place at the box office on its opening weekend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=weekend&amp;id=beverlyhillsninja.htm|title=Box Office Mojo data for ''Beverly Hills Ninja''|publisher=Boxofficemojo.com|date=1997-01-17|accessdate=2010-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drug and alcohol abuse related problems interfered with Farley's film work at this time. Production of his final film, ''[[Almost Heroes]]'', was held up several times so Farley could enter rehab. He was known among comedic contemporaries and friends to be sensitive about how his comedy was perceived ("fatty falls down, everybody goes home happy"), and was particularly hurt by harsh critical reactions to ''Tommy Boy'', a film he enjoyed making.

He was particularly dissatisfied with ''Black Sheep'', an attempt by the studio to recapture the chemistry on ''Tommy Boy'', and was only 60 pages into the script when the project was green lit. As a result, he relapsed on the night of the premiere, which required further rehab before he could begin work on ''Beverly Hills Ninja''.&lt;ref name=nypost&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/12162007/entertainment/that_was_awesome__816891.htm?page=0|title=That Was Awesome!|last=Tucker|first=Reed|date=2007-12-16|publisher=New York Post|accessdate=2008-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his death on December 18, 1997, his final completed films, ''[[Almost Heroes]]'' and ''[[Dirty Work (1998 film)|Dirty Work]]'', were released posthumously in the summer of 1998.

===Unfinished projects===
Farley was originally cast as the voice of [[Shrek (character)|the title character]] in the movie ''[[Shrek]]'', recording 85% (or 95% according to some sources) of the character's dialogue, but died just before recording was finished; the role was then played by [[Mike Myers]]. A story reel featuring a sample of Farley's recorded dialogue was released officially in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Griggs|first1=Brandon|title=Hear Chris Farley's Shrek in newly unearthed clip|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/06/entertainment/chris-farley-shrek-voice-feat|publisher=CNN|accessdate=August 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original version of Shrek was more like Farley himself, according to his brother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Plolowy|first1=Kevin|title=Chris Farley’s Original ‘Shrek’ Was 'Humble, Bumbling, Innocent’, According to Brother|url=https://www.yahoo.com/movies/chris-farley-shrek-original-casting-how-different-125465444507.html/publisher=Yahoo!|accessdate=May 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Farley was slated for another voice role in ''[[Dinosaur (film)|Dinosaur]]'' as a young male brachiosaurus named Sorbus who, despite his gigantic stature, was frightened of heights. After his death, the character was rewritten as Baylene, an elderly female Brachiosaurus played by British actress [[Joan Plowright]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Parks|first=Zack|title=Top 10 Actors Who Almost Voiced Disney Animated Characters|date=September 28, 2012|url=http://geektyrant.com/news/2012/9/28/top-10-actors-who-almost-voiced-disney-animated-characters.html|accessdate=July 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of his death, Farley had been in talks to costar with [[Vince Vaughn]] in ''The Gelfin'', and to star in a biographical film about comedian [[Roscoe Arbuckle|Fatty Arbuckle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Redding|first=Jordan|title=The Life of Chris Farley Gone But Not Forgotten|date=November 30, 2014|publisher=''[[Moviepilot]]''|url=http://moviepilot.com/posts/2014/11/30/the-life-of-chris-farley-gone-but-not-forgotten-2471222?lt_source=external,manual|accessdate=July 31, 2015}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rabin|first=Nathan|title=Fatty fall down, make tragedy: The Chris Farley Show|date=June 9, 2009|publisher=''[[The A.V.

==Health problems and death==
[[File:Farleygrave.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Farley's grave in 2010]]
Farley was obese for much of his life and at the time of his death weighed 296 pounds and stood only 5 feet 8 inches (1.73 cm). He began to abuse alcohol and illicit drugs early in his career; such addictions caused him to be suspended repeatedly from the cast of ''Saturday Night Live''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Steve|last=Mills|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1998-01-03/news/9801030066_1_chris-farley-cocaine-and-morphine-medical-examiner|title=Drug overdose killed comedian Farley|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|publisher=[[Tronc]]|location=Chicago, Illinois|date=January 3, 1998|accessdate=July 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bernie Brillstein]], who personally managed [[John Belushi]] and whose firm [[Brillstein Entertainment Partners|Brillstein-Grey Entertainment]] managed Farley, repeatedly sent Farley to drug and alcohol rehabilitation.&lt;ref&gt;Bernie Brillstein, Where Did I Go Right? You're No One in Hollywood Unless Someone Wants You Dead (1999, Little, Brown and Company)&lt;/ref&gt; Brillstein later wrote that he learned from Belushi's death the importance of early and firm insistence on treatment for addiction, but that Farley (like many addicts) became adept at deception to hide the extent of his abuse and avoid rehab.

Following his final guest appearance on ''SNL'' on October 25, 1997, there was a visible decline in Farley's health. Farley's hoarse voice and flushed skin were the subject of public scrutiny.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Tom|last=Shales|first2=James Andrew|last2=Miller|title=Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live|publisher=Back Bay|location=New York City|year=2003|pages=492–93|isbn=0-316-73565-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the final years of his life, Farley had sought treatment for obesity and drug abuse on 17 occasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,281398,00.html|title=The Last Temptation of Chris|first=Chris|last=Nashawaty|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]]|location=New York City|date=January 9, 1998|accessdate=June 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 18, 1997, Farley was found dead by his younger brother, [[John P. Farley|John]], in his apartment in the John Hancock Center in Chicago; he was 33 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Larry|last1=Sutton|first2=Robert|last2=Domiguez|first3=Linda|last3=Hervieux|first4=Michael|last4=Sweeney|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/comic-farley-dead-age-33-article-1.772521|title=Chris Farley, actor and comedian, dies at 33 in 1997|newspaper=[[New York Daily News]]|publisher=[[Tronc]]|location=New York City|date=December 16, 2015|accessdate=July 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; An autopsy revealed that Farley had died of an overdose of [[cocaine]] and [[morphine]],&lt;ref name=NYTimes-Jan3&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/03/us/chris-farley-s-death-laid-to-drug-overdose.html|title=Chris Farley's Death Laid to Drug Overdose|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=New York Times Company|location=New York City|date=January 3, 1998|accessdate=June 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; a combination called [[Speedball (drug)|speedball]]. Advanced [[atherosclerosis]] was cited as a "significant contributing factor."&lt;ref name=nypost/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTimes-Jan3 /&gt; Farley's death is often compared to that of his ''SNL'' idol [[John Belushi]], who also died at the same age of the same cause.&lt;ref name="cnn"/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTimes-Jan3 /&gt;

A private funeral was held for Farley on December 23, 1997, at Our Lady Queen of Peace Catholic Church in his hometown of Madison, Wisconsin. Over 500 people attended this funeral, including many comedians who had worked with him on ''Saturday Night Live'' and on film, such as [[Dan Aykroyd]] and [[Adam Sandler]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Sharon|last=Thelmer|url=http://www.onlineathens.com/1997/122497/1224.a3farley.html|title=Fellow comedians weep for Chris Farley|work=[[Athens Daily News]]|publisher=[[Gatehouse Media]]|location=Athens, Georgia|date=December 18, 1997|accessdate=October 25, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090818015306/http://www.onlineathens.com/1997/122497/1224.a3farley.html|archivedate=August 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Joal|last=Ryan|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/35689/farley-funeral-day-the-clowns-cried|title=Farley funeral: The Day the Clowns Cried|website=eonline.com|date=December 23, 1997|accessdate=March 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; notably absent was Farley’s best friend [[David Spade]], who chose not to attend the funeral, stating years later that he had found it emotionally hard to handle Farley's sudden death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Kory|last=Grow|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/david-spade-explains-why-he-didnt-attend-chris-farleys-funeral-20140430|title=David Spade Explains Why He Didn’t Attend Chris Farley’s Funeral|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|publisher=Wenner Media Ltd.|location=New York City|date=April 30, 2014|accessdate=July 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Farley’s remains were entombed at [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Madison#Cemeteries|Resurrection Cemetery]].

==Legacy==
On August 26, 2005, Farley was posthumously awarded the 2,289th star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]], located in front of [[I.O.

The song "Purple Stain" from the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]]' 1999 album, ''[[Californication (album)|Californication]]'', contains the lyric "Farley is an angel and I can prove this" as a tribute to Farley.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000394/bio|title=Chris Farley|website=IMDb|access-date=2017-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
