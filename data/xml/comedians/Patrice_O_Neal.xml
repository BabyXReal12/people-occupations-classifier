'''Patrice Lumumba Malcolm O'Neal''' (December 7, 1969 – November 29, 2011) was an American stand-up comedian, actor, and radio host. He grew up in Boston and developed an interest in stand-up comedy at a young age, first performing in 1992 when his act mainly focused on conversations with his audience.&lt;ref name=rollingstone2012&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.vondecarlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Patrice-ONeal-Rolling-Stone-compressed.pdf|title=Death of a Stand-Up|format=PDF|first=Jonah|last=Weiner|issue=1150|pages=47–49|magazine=Rolling Stone|date=February 16, 2012|accessdate=April 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/lists/50-best-stand-up-comics-of-all-time-w464199/janeane-garofalo-w464228|title=50 Best Stand-Up Comics of All Time|website=Rollingstone.com|accessdate=April 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Neal became known for his conversational and often confrontational point of view stand-up. His profile rose through appearances on ''[[Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn]]'' and, from 2002,  ''[[Opie and Anthony]]''. He hosted ''The Black Phillip Show'' on radio from 2006 to 2008. O'Neal died of a [[stroke]] resulting from his [[Diabetes mellitus type 2 |diabetes]] on November 29, 2011, at the age of 41.

==Early life==
Patrice Lumumba Malcolm O'Neal was born on December 7, 1969 in New York City.&lt;ref name=nymag2012&gt;{{cite web|title=The Comedian Comedians Were Afraid Of|url=http://nymag.com/news/features/patrice-oneal-2012-5/|work=New York Magazine|first=Adrian Nicole|last=LeBlanc|date=May 13, 2012|accessdate=April 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nytimes2011/&gt; His mother Georgia named him after [[Patrice Lumumba]], the leader of the Congolese [[Mouvement National Congolais|independence movement]] and the country's first prime minister, and African-American human rights activist [[Malcolm X]].&lt;ref name=nytimes2011/&gt; O'Neal was bullied at school over his name, yet he "learned how to be a man with this name".&lt;ref name=rollingstone2012/&gt; He was raised by his mother in the largely black working class area of [[Roxbury, Boston|Roxbury]] in [[Boston]], Massachusetts, with his sister Zinda. O'Neal never knew his father.&lt;ref name=montreal2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=nymag2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=nytimes2011&gt;{{cite news|first=Daniel E.|last=Slotnik|title=Patrice O'Neal, Boisterous Comedian, Dies at 41|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/30/arts/patrice-oneal-boisterous-comedian-dies-at-41.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=November 29, 2011|accessdate=November 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[West Roxbury High School]], during which he took up American football and ended his playing career with three [[varsity letter]] awards and winning a state championship in his senior year.&lt;ref name=baystatebanner2011/&gt;

After graduating from West Roxbury High School, O'Neal turned down a sports scholarship at [[Northeastern University]] in Boston, which included a housing grant, in favour of studying performing arts at the university, with a major in theater studies.&lt;ref name=rollingstone2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=baystatebanner2011&gt;Corey Manning, Bay State Banner, [http://baystatebanner.com/news/2011/dec/06/an-appreciation-for-comedian-patrice-oneal/ An Appreciation for Comedian Patrice O'Neal], December 6, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; His interest in comedy had grown by this time, and he took up work as a bouncer at the Comedy Connection in Boston.&lt;ref name=nymag2012/&gt; He cited [[George Carlin]] and [[Richard Pryor]] as his comedic influences.&lt;ref name=rollingstone2012/&gt;&lt;ref name="nj"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nj.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2011/11/patrice_o_neal_dead_dies.html|title=Comedian Patrice O'Neal dead at 41|work=The Star-Ledger|last=Venutolo|first=Anthony|date=November 29, 2011|accessdate=June 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other work that O'Neal took up included selling food at the [[Boston Garden]] arena.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Unmasked2007|''Unmasked with Patrice O'Neal'' at 32:53–32:58]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===Early years: 1992–2002===
O'Neal performed his first stand-up in October 1992 at Estelle's in Boston.&lt;ref name="patriceoneal.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patriceoneal.com/bio.php|title=Patrice O'Neal Online|publisher=Patriceoneal.com|date=February 19, 2011|accessdate=August 12, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025151248/http://www.patriceoneal.com/bio.php|archivedate=October 25, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=baystatebanner2011/&gt; He had attended an open-mic night at the venue the week prior to his debut where he heckled a performer, who in turn challenged him to try stand-up himself.&lt;ref name=rollingstone2012/&gt; Comedian [[Dane Cook]] witnessed one of O'Neals earliest sets and noted his "gentle-giant appeal ... He already had an edge, but he was a little more vulnerable".&lt;ref name=rollingstone2012/&gt; O'Neal developed his act in the Boston area for the next six years, where early on he performed under the name Bruiser O'Neal.&lt;ref name=latimes2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=baystatebanner2011/&gt; In the mid-1990s, O'Neal first met comedian and later close friend [[Jim Norton (American comedian)|Jim Norton]].&lt;ref name=rollingstone2012/&gt;

In 1998 O'Neal relocated to New York City, working regular spots at the [[Comedy Cellar]].&lt;ref name=baystatebanner2011/&gt; In early 1998, he took part in the fourth annual [[The Comedy Festival|US Comedy Arts Festival]] in Aspen, Colorado.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1998-03-29/features/1998088041_1_carpenter-comedy-arts-festival-deal/3|title=Comic opera High drama at the U.S. Comedy Arts Festival|work=Baltimore Sun|first=Arthur|last=Hirsch|date=March 29, 1998|accessdate=May 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then moved to Los Angeles in the hopes of finding greater fame: "I tap danced like you wouldn't believe ... trying to get something ... If I'd have had a gun back then, I would have shot myself".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Unmasked2007|''Unmasked with Patrice O'Neal'' at 09:45–09:59]]&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, O'Neal was flown to [[England]] by English stand up [[John Simmit]] to play his Upfront Comedy circuit &amp; other gigs, after he was "essentially thrown out of America" as he could not earn enough money, and was unwilling to yield to the demands of club owners that he change his confrontational act.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Unmasked2007|''Unmasked with Patrice O'Neal'' at 15:00–15:46]]&lt;/ref&gt; O'Neal worked hard to gain the respect of his peers and recalled it took around five months "for them to go 'Ok, this guy's not playing around".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Unmasked2007|''Unmasked with Patrice O'Neal'' at 17:37–17:54]]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In late 2000, he took a writing position with the [[WWE]] after an associate saw him perform. A big fan of wrestling, he pitched his idea for building a feud over three weeks that culminated in a pay-per-view event which won him the job. He visited owner [[Vince McMahon]]'s house, traveled with the organization for one week of live shows on their private jet, and directed some vignettes. O'Neal was then offered a 13-week contract, but turned it down as he already had plans, and said if he had kept doing it, "it wouldn't have been a dream ... It was short and sweet".&lt;ref name=complex2016&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.complex.com/sports/2016/05/wrestling-with-your-dream-job|title=Wrestling With a Dream Job: How a Regular Guy Became a Writer for the WWE|first=Andrew|last=Goldstein|publisher=Complex UK|date=May 17, 2016|accessdate=May 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=atlantic2010&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100408051243/http://www.atlanticcityweekly.com/news-and-views/5-questions-with/5-questions-with--patrice-oneal-86246362.html|url=http://www.atlanticcityweekly.com/news-and-views/5-questions-with/5-questions-with--patrice-oneal-86246362.html|archivedate=April 8, 2010|date=March 9, 2010|first=Jon|last=Heacock|title=5 Questions With ...

He later stated, "I'm a professional bridge-burner".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nesne.rhynewservice.com/Log/ftpPUTviT|title=Harrington Announces June Retirement|website=Nesne.rhynewservice.com|accessdate=April 20, 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121209160837/http://nesne.rhynewservice.com/Log/ftpPUTviT|archivedate=December 9, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comedy specials: 2002–2009===
By 2002, O'Neal had returned to the US after he received an offer to record a half-hour comedy special on [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Unmasked2007|''Unmasked with Patrice O'Neal'' at 18:12–18:34]]&lt;/ref&gt; He settled in the New York City area, and made his debut appearance on the ''[[Opie and Anthony]]'' radio show on January 17, 2002, when friend and comedian [[Rich Vos]] brought him onto the show which at the time, aired from [[WNEW-FM|WNEW]]. After the show relaunched on [[XM Satellite Radio]] in 2004 following its suspension in August 2002, O'Neal returned as a guest, or sometimes sitting in for an absent Norton and became one of the show's most popular guests.&lt;ref name=latimes2011/&gt; He  landed his first of a series of television appearances, beginning with the sketch program ''The Colin Quinn Show'', followed by ''[[Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn]]'' which he appeared from 2002 until its cancellation in 2004. In 2003, he recorded a special for ''[[Comedy Central Presents]]''. His first television appearance was on ''The Apollo Comedy Hour''.&lt;ref name="imdb"&gt;{{IMDb name|id=1169306|name=Patrice Oneal}}&lt;/ref&gt; From there, he moved on to appearances on ''[[Showtime at the Apollo]]'' and ''FNight Videos''. He appeared in guest-starring roles on [[MTV]]'s ''[[Apartment 2F]]'', ''[[Assy McGee]]'', ''[[Yes Dear]]'', ''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]]'', ''[[Chappelle's Show]]'' and ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]''.&lt;ref name="imdb"/&gt; 

O'Neal was a regular on the Fox series ''The Jury'', and he starred in the Comedy Central animated program ''Shorties Watching Shorties'' with [[Nick Di Paolo]]. He supplied the voice of Harold Jenkins on [[Noggin (TV channel)|Noggin]]'s animated program ''O'Grady High'' and was featured as Jesus in [[Denis Leary]]'s ''Searchlight''.&lt;ref name="imdb"/&gt; In 2005, he filmed a half-hour ''[[One Night Stand (US TV series)|One Night Stand]]'' special for [[HBO]]. He then became the host of the seasons one and two of ''[[Web Junk 20]]'' on [[VH1]], in 2006.&lt;ref name=stjoseph2008&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-17207861.html|title=Oneal for real; Love him or hate him, comedian Patrice Oneal is always himself|date=July 25, 2008|work=St. Joseph News-Press|first=Shea|last=Connor|via=[[Highbeam Research]]|subscription=yes|accessdate=May 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After two seasons, O'Neal declined to host the third despite an offer that quadrupled his salary. He was replaced by [[Jim Breuer]].&lt;ref name=nymag2012/&gt;

[[File:Patrice Oneal.jpg|thumb|right|upright|O'Neal performing as part of the [[Opie and Anthony's Traveling Virus Comedy Tour (2007)|2007 Opie and Anthony's Traveling Virus Comedy Tour]]]]
In 2006, O'Neal settled in [[Jersey City]].&lt;ref name=rollingstone2012/&gt; In [[Opie and Anthony's Traveling Virus Comedy Tour (2006)|2006]] and [[Opie and Anthony's Traveling Virus Comedy Tour (2007)|2007]], O'Neal joined [[Opie and Anthony's Traveling Virus Comedy Tour]], playing large arenas across the US. From 2006 to 2008, O'Neal hosted a relationship advice show on XM initially titled ''Bitch Management'' before it was renamed to ''The Black Philip Show'', a reference to doctor and television personality [[Phil McGraw|"Dr. Phil" McGraw]].&lt;ref name=nymag2012/&gt; The show aired on Saturday evenings with Dante Nero as co-host, and a rotating cast of female comedians on third mic. The show ended following the XM and Sirius merger, when the new management was unable to reconcile budgets for Saturday night programming.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

O'Neal had also appeared as a guest on other shows such as ''[[Alex Jones (radio host)|The Alex Jones Show]]'' and segments on [[Fox News]]. While in the NYC area, he performed at comedy clubs in the area, including headlining appearances at [[Comix NY|Comix]] and [[Caroline's]]. In 2007, O'Neal revealed he turned down to appear on ''[[Celebrity Fit Club (U.S. TV series)|Celebrity Fit Club]]'' and said, "my career is more important to my health".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Unmasked2007|''Unmasked: Patrice O'Neal'' at 03:58–04:11]]&lt;/ref&gt; He also made five appearances at the annual [[Just for Laughs]] festival in Montreal, Canada, including a one-man, one-week show at Théâtre Sainte-Catherine in 2008.&lt;ref name=montreal2012/&gt;

In 2007, O'Neal wrote and starred in a web series called ''The Patrice O'Neal Show – Coming Soon!'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patriceoneal.com|title=Patrice O'Neal Online|publisher=Patriceoneal.com|date=February 19, 2011|accessdate=August 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; featuring his girlfriend, Nero, Bryan Kennedy, Harris Stanton, and Wil Sylvince. The series did not last long as it was unable to attain a sponsor due to its offensive content.&lt;ref name=nymag2012/&gt; He guest starred in another For Your Imagination-produced show, called ''[[Break a Leg (sitcom)|Break a Leg]]'', playing "Adult-Sized [[Gary Coleman]]". O'Neal voiced Jeffron James in ''[[Grand Theft Auto IV]]'' on its in-game radio station [[Grand Theft Auto IV soundtrack#WKTT – We Know The Truth|Fizz!]].

In March 2010, O'Neal secured a deal with Comedy Central for a stand-up special and a script for a proposed reality television show, ''Patrice O'Neal's Guide to White People''. He got the idea for the latter after he interjected into a conversation with two white males over guitar riffs, and thought of the idea of him "trying to learn about white folks".&lt;ref name=reporter2010&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/patrice-oneal-gets-gigs-comedy-21984|title=Patrice Oneal gets gigs at Comedy Central|first=Nellie|last=Andreeva|work=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=May 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show was cancelled before filming could begin.

In July 2010, O'Neal was booked to perform five sold-out shows at Les Katacombes in [[Montreal]] as part of the Zoofest program of the Just for Laughs Comedy Festival, but he was refused entry into Canada, resulting in their cancellation and refunds offered.&lt;ref name=cbc2010&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100720193729/http://www.cbc.ca/arts/theatre/story/2010/07/16/patrice-oneal-canadian-border.html|url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/theatre/story/2010/07/16/patrice-oneal-canadian-border.html|archivedate=July 20, 2010|date=July 16, 2010|title=U.S. comic blocked at Canadian border|publisher=CBC News|accessdate=May 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Neal was denied entry due to his 1986 statutory rape charge.&lt;ref name=montreal2012&gt;{{cite web|last=Brownstein|first=Bill|date=January 28, 2012|title=Parting shots from the fearless Mr. P|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302134013/http://www.montrealgazette.com/news/todays-paper/Parting+shots+from+fearless/6065766/story.html|url=http://www.montrealgazette.com/news/todays-paper/Parting+shots+from+fearless/6065766/story.html|archivedate=March 2, 2012|work=The Montreal Gazette|accessdate=May 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 O'Neal recorded his first special for Comedy Central. The special premiered on the network on February 19, 2011 which he titled ''[[Elephant in the Room (Patrice Oneal)|Elephant in the Room]]''. An uncut version of the special was released on CD and DVD three days later. O'Neal promoted the special with an interview on ''[[Late Night with Jimmy Fallon]]'', his first network television appearance in four years.&lt;ref name=nymag2012/&gt;

In 2011, O'Neal performed as one of the comedians for ''[[Comedy Central Roast|The Comedy Central Roast of Charlie Sheen]]'' as he expressed his respect for the actor and wished to tell him in person.&lt;ref name=nymag2012/&gt; The show aired on September 19, 2011 with O'Neal the last comic to perform. It acquired 6.4 million viewers, still the highest rated edition of the Comedy Central roasts. O'Neal's appearance on the roast was to be his final television appearance prior to his untimely death two months later. After the taping, O'Neal met [[William Shatner]] and his wife, who was also in attendance, in the garage and the couple offered their support to O'Neal regarding his diabetes, after which the three cried. Shatner recalled, "He knew that he was dying, that he was a dying man, and in a way, he wanted to die ... That's what I saw. That's why we cried."&lt;ref name=nymag2012/&gt;

On October 27, 2011, O'Neal's final interview was released with [[Jay Mohr]] for his podcast, ''Mohr Stories''. He stated that his appearance at Sheen's roast did little to transform his career apart from helping sell out a weekend of stand-up shows at Caroline's. He revealed a further meeting with FX regarding a possible animated series, and a project that involved his friends coming to his home to record interviews.&lt;ref name=nymag2012/&gt;

=== Posthumous career ===
After O'Neal's death, BSeen Media announced the release of his first comedy album ''[[Mr. P (album)|Mr. P]]'', which he had been working on. The set, recorded in April 2011 at [[The Improv|D.C. Improv]] in Washington, D.C., was released on February 7, 2012 with his involvement prior to his passing.&lt;ref name=montreal2012/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.laughspin.com/2011/11/30/new-patrice-oneal-album-will-be-released-next-year/ |title=New Patrice O'Neal album will be released next year |publisher=Laughspin.com |accessdate=December 1, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111202072555/http://www.laughspin.com/2011/11/30/new-patrice-oneal-album-will-be-released-next-year/ |archive-date=December 2, 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sales of the release were donated to his mother, girlfriend, and stepdaughter.

O'Neal was diagnosed with [[type 2 diabetes]] at 23, a condition which his mother also had.&lt;ref name=rollingstone2012/&gt; However, O'Neal failed to follow medical advice, and instead skipped doses of medication and adopted a diet not recommended for diabetics, leading to struggles with his weight years later.&lt;ref name=stjoseph2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=diabetes2011/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=JP DelaCuesta|url=http://allhiphop.com/2011/11/29/comedian-patrice-oneal-dead-at-41-following-stroke-and-battle-with-diabetes|title=Comedian Patrice O'Neal Dead at 41 Following Stroke and Battle With Diabetes|publisher=AllHipHop.com|date= November 29, 2011|accessdate=December 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Comedian Patrice O'Neal: A Final Interview|date=October 2011|last=Butler|first=Carolyn|url=http://forecast.diabetes.org/magazine/only-online/comedian-patrice-o%E2%80%99neal-a-final-interview|publisher=Diabetes Forecast|accessdate=November 29, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130414154515/http://forecast.diabetes.org/magazine/only-online/comedian-patrice-o%E2%80%99neal-a-final-interview|archivedate=April 14, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of his life, O'Neal attempted to improve his health by adopting a vegan diet, juicing, and reducing his intake of unhealthy foods, yet he was still unable to lose weight.&lt;ref name=nymag2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=rollingstone2012/&gt; In 2011, he stood at 6'5" and weighed approximately 300 lbs and said his diabetes was "finally catching up with [him]."&lt;ref name=diabetes2011&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diabetesforecast.org/2011/dec/comedian-patrice-o-neal-a-final-interview.html?referrer=http://theinterrobang.com/black-saturday-remembering-great-patrice-oneal/|title=Comedian Patrice O'Neal: A Final Interview|work=Diabetes Forecast|first=Carolyn|last=Butler|date=December 2011|accessdate=May 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early hours of October 19, 2011, O'Neal phoned his girlfriend to tell her he couldn't move his legs. He was rushed to [[Jersey City Medical Center]], and later [[Englewood Hospital and Medical Center|Englewood Hospital]], where doctors performed surgery to remove a [[blood clot]] in his head.&lt;ref name=rollingstone2012/&gt; He lost his ability to speak, and later his ability to move, for a time communicating by eye movements before losing that ability as well.

==Comic style==
O'Neal's comedy has been described as conversational.&lt;ref name=montreal2012/&gt;&lt;ref name="dead-frog.com"&gt;{{cite web|last=Jackson|first=Todd|url=http://www.dead-frog.com/blog/entry/patrice_oneal_1969_2011 |title=Patrice O'Neal 1969–2011|publisher=Dead-Frog|date=November 29, 2011|accessdate=August 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a provocateur, often inciting audience members to [[heckler|call out]], or even leave the club. "I've seen him give people money to leave," recalls [[Gregg Hughes|Gregg "Opie" Hughes]].&lt;ref name="O&amp;A1"&gt;''The Opie and Anthony Show'', November 30, 2011, Sirius XM Satellite Radio&lt;/ref&gt; 

At times he would encourage people to call out to the stage to set up a punchline. "Ladies, how would you keep your man if you lost your vagina?," O'Neal would ask of his audience. When the women would invariably reference oral and anal sex, the comedian would respond, "See, I gave you the chance to talk and you qualified yourself as a series of holes."&lt;ref name="dead-frog.com"/&gt;
