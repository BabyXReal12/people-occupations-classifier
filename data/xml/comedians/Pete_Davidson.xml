Davidson first tried his hand at stand-up comedy at age 16 in a Staten Island bowling alley, where a group of friends, knowing of his comedy aspirations, dared him to take to the stage. He did so only after smoking marijuana.&lt;ref name=SFChronicle&gt;Vaziri, Aidin (August 12, 2015).

==Career==
[[File:Pete Davidson in 2013.jpg|alt=Davidson looking away from the camera|thumb|Davidson in 2013]]
Davidson's earliest onscreen appearance was in the third episode of the MTV comedy series ''Failosophy'', which premiered February 28, 2013. The following month, he appeared in "PDA and Moms," a third-season episode of the [[MTV2]] reality TV comedy series ''[[Guy Code]]'', the first of four episodes in which he was featured.&lt;ref name=MTV/&gt; That June, his first televised standup aired as part of a second-season episode of the [[Comedy Central]] program ''Gotham Comedy Live'', which showcases standup comedians at the Gotham Comedy Club in New York City. The following month, he returned to MTV2 with an appearance on ''[[Nick Cannon Presents: Wild 'N Out]]'', his first of six episode appearances on that show.

Davidson subsequently made standup appearances on ''[[Adam Devine's House Party]]'', ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'', ''[[Comedy Underground with Dave Attell]]'', and guest-starred in ''[[Brooklyn Nine-Nine]]''. In 2014, he acquired a role in a Fox comedy pilot, ''Sober Companion'',&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg, Lesley (February 25, 2014). [http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/justin-long-star-fox-comedy-683484 "Justin Long to Star in Fox Comedy 'Sober Companion'"]. ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; but it ultimately did not make it to series.&lt;ref&gt;Andreeva, Nellie (May 12, 2014).

''[[Deadline Hollywood]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Davidson joined the cast of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' with that show's 40th-season premiere, which debuted on September 27, 2014. At age 20, he was the first ''SNL'' cast member to be born in the 1990s, and one of the youngest cast members ever.&lt;ref name=Diamondback/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.avclub.com/article/dust-settles-snl-new-cast-member-and-genuinely-hap-209239 |last=Rife |first=Katie |publisher=[[The A.V.

In March 2015, Davidson was a roaster on the ''[[Comedy Central Roast]]'' of [[Justin Bieber]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McDonagh |first=Ross |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-3017141/Pete-Davidson-slams-comedienne-Natasha-Leggero-Twitter-stealing-joke-Justin-Bieber-s-Comedy-Central-Roast.html |title=SNL's Pete Davidson slams comedienne Natasha Leggero on Twitter for 'stealing' his joke from Justin Bieber's Comedy Central Roast|newspaper=[[Daily Mail]]|date=March 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his set was praised as one of the best of the show.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Paul (March 16, 2015).

''[[Rolling Stone]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Among his bolder jokes was one at the expense of fellow roaster [[Snoop Dogg]] and host [[Kevin Hart]], and their 2004 film ''[[Soul Plane]]''. Davidson, whose firefighter father died during the September 11 attacks, called that film "the worst experience of my life involving a plane."&lt;ref name=SFChronicle/&gt;

In 2016, Davidson was on the [[Forbes 30 Under 30|''Forbes'' 30 under 30]] list.&lt;ref name="forbes"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/30-under-30-2016/hollywood-entertainment/#50cc7d23fd27 |title=Forbes 30 Under 30 2016 |work=[[Forbes (magazine)|Forbes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2016, Davidson recorded his first stand-up special ''Pete Davidson: SMD.'' The [[Comedy Central]] special was filmed in [[New York City]]. He made an appearance on ''[[The Jim Gaffigan Show]].''{{cn|date=August 2018}}

==Comedy style==
Davidson has been lauded for basing his comedy on his own life and employing aspects of his life that have been likened to "a series of brutal truths and vulgar confessions," and which make him relatable to audiences. Touching upon topics such as marijuana, sex, and relationships, incidents he relates include those from his awkward high school experiences to living in a dormitory during his brief stint at [[St. Francis College]].&lt;ref name=Diamondback/&gt; Davidson jokes about highly sensitive subjects, including the loss of his father during the [[September 11 attacks]], because, he says, he finds that it empowers him to address the feeling of powerlessness that experiencing such tragedy at a young age inflicted upon him.&lt;ref name=NYTimes/&gt; He is a fan of the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' franchise, and has incorporated that material into his comedy work as well.&lt;ref name=Diamondback/&gt;&lt;ref name=EW9.29.14/&gt;

==Personal life==
As of October 2015, Davidson lives in [[Brooklyn Heights|Brooklyn Heights, New York]].&lt;ref name=NYTimes/&gt;

Davidson has his father's badge number, 8418, tattooed on his left arm.&lt;ref name=NYTimes/&gt; Davidson supported [[Hillary Clinton]] in the [[2016 U.S. presidential election]], and on December 5, 2017, he stated on his [[Instagram]] account that he got a tattoo on his leg of Clinton, whom he called his "hero", a "badass", and "one of the strongest people in the universe." Clinton herself thanked Davidson for the compliment, commenting, "This makes it significantly less awkward that I’ve had a Pete Davidson tattoo for years."&lt;ref&gt;Hearon, Sarah (December 15, 2017). [https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/did-snls-pete-davidson-just-get-a-hillary-clinton-tattoo/ "SNL’s Pete Davidson Posts Picture of Hillary Clinton Tattoo on Instagram "]. ''[[Us Weekly]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was diagnosed with [[Crohn's disease]] at age 17 or 18,&lt;ref name=HighTimes/&gt; for which he receives intravenous treatment&lt;ref name=NYTimes/&gt; and used medical marijuana as a pain reliever.&lt;ref name=HighTimes/&gt; On March 6, 2017, Davidson announced on his Instagram account that he had quit drugs and was sober for the first time in eight years.&lt;ref name=Yahoo/&gt; During an interview on comedian [[Marc Maron]]'s podcast, Davidson clarified that the only drug he used was marijuana and, while he has since cut back its use considerably, the personal problems he initially assumed were a result of his daily marijuana habit were actually caused by [[borderline personality disorder]], for which he has since been undergoing treatment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episode-849-pete-davidson "Episode 849 - Pete Davidson"].
