'''Jeremy James Hardy''' (born 17 July 1961) is an English comedian.

Born and raised in North [[Hampshire]], he studied at the [[University of Southampton]] and began his stand-up career in the 1980s, going on to win the [[Edinburgh Comedy Awards|Perrier Comedy Award]] at the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] in 1988. Today he is best known for his appearances on radio panel shows such as the ''[[The News Quiz|News Quiz]]'' and ''[[I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue]]''.

==Early life==
Hardy was born in [[Farnborough, Hampshire|Farnborough]], Hampshire.  He attended [[Farnham College]] and studied [[Modern History]] and Politics at the [[University of Southampton]]. He subsequently attempted but failed  to obtain a place on a journalism course. He also considered being an actor or poet.&lt;ref name=boltonnews/&gt; 

==Career==
Hardy started [[scriptwriting]] before turning to [[stand-up comedy]] in London in the early 1980s,&lt;ref name=boltonnews/&gt; funded in part by the [[Enterprise Allowance Scheme]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|accessdate=2018-07-29|title=Jeremy Hardy looks back at 'the one decent thing Thatcher did'|url=http://www.harrowtimes.co.uk/news/11805898.Jeremy_Hardy_looks_back_at__the_one_decent_thing_Thatcher_did_/|newspaper=[[Harrow Times]]|date=19 February 2015|first=Rosy|last=Moorhead}}&lt;/ref&gt; He and won the [[Perrier Comedy Award]] in 1988 at the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]].  

He made his television debut in the late 1980s, featuring regularly as Jeremy the [[boom operator (media)]] in the [[Rory Bremner]]-led comedy show ''Now – Something Else'' on [[BBC Two]] , along with guest appearances on programmes including the  [[BBC One]] talk show ''[[Wogan (TV series)]]''.&lt;ref name=boltonnews&gt;{{cite newspaper|accessdate=2018-07-29|title=Jeremy's stand-up routine|url=http://www.theboltonnews.co.uk/news/5983532.Jeremy_s_stand-up_routine/|newspaper=[[The Bolton News]]|date=22 February 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to feature in various comedy shows including ''[[Blackadder Goes Forth]]'' (1989), and has presented a television documentary about the political background to the [[English Civil War]] as well as an edition of ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' in 1996. He was one of the two team captains on the BBC Two game show ''[[If I Ruled the World (game show)|If I Ruled the World]]'' that ran for two series in 1998–1999.&lt;ref name=boltonnews/&gt;

He has become best known for his work on [[BBC Radio 4]], particularly on ''[[The News Quiz]]'', ''[[I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue]]'' and his long-running series of monologues ''[[Jeremy Hardy Speaks to the Nation]]''. His excruciatingly off-key singing is a long-running joke on the radio panel show ''[[I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue]]'', on which he appears regularly, and replicated to great disadvantage in the spin-off radio series "You'll Have Had Your Tea: The Doings of [[Hamish and Dougal]].".
His experiences in Palestine during the Israeli army incursions of 2002 became the subject of a feature documentary ''[[Jeremy Hardy vs. the Israeli Army]]'' (2003), directed by [[Leila Sansour]]. A four-episode series entitled ''Jeremy Hardy Feels It'' was broadcast on Radio 4 in December 2017 to January 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2018-07-29|title=Jeremy Hardy Feels It|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b09kbs4h|website=BBC Radio 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hardy wrote a regular column for ''[[The Guardian]]'' until 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hardy, Jeremy|title=Frankly, I've got nothing to joke about|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/Columnists/Column/0,,468272,00.html|date=4 April 2001|accessdate=13 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then wrote a column in the ''[[London Evening Standard]]'''s magazine.&lt;ref name=boltonnews/&gt;

His first book, ''My Family and Other Strangers'', based on his research into his [[family history]], was published by [[Ebury Press]] on 4 March 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|first1=Jeremy|last1=Hardy|accessdate=2018-07-29|title=Jeremy Hardy's family tree|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/feb/27/jeremy-hardy-family-tree-grandmother|date=27 February 2010|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political views==
Hardy supported Irish nationalist [[Róisín McAliskey]], the then-pregnant daughter of [[Bernadette Devlin McAliskey]], when the former was accused of involvement in an IRA mortar attack in Germany, and put up part of the bail money to free her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jeremy Hardy:Caustic comic|publisher=[[BBC News]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/uk/2000/newsmakers/1913049.stm|date=5 April 2002|accessdate=13 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also supported the campaign to free [[Danny McNamee]], wrongly convicted of involvement in the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]]'s (IRA) [[Hyde Park and Regents Park bombings|Hyde Park]] bombing on 20 July 1982.&lt;ref name="mult1"&gt;{{cite news | title = McNamee's 11-year campaign for justice | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/236912.stm | publisher = BBC News | date = 17 December 1998 | accessdate = 27 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an edition of ''Jeremy Hardy Speaks to the Nation'' on [[BBC Radio 4]] "How to be Afraid," broadcast in September 2004, Hardy suggested that members and supporters of the [[British National Party|BNP]] should be "shot in the back of the head", sparking complaints and causing [[Borough of Burnley|Burnley Borough Council]] to cancel a show in the town over fears that it could be "disruptive" in an area with a recent history of racial tension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Comic banned for 'shoot BNP' joke|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/lancashire/3974731.stm|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=2 November 2004|accessdate=13 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2016, Hardy performed at the Keep Corbyn rally in Brighton in support of [[Jeremy Corbyn]]'s [[Jeremy Corbyn Labour Party leadership campaign, 2016|campaign]] in the [[Labour Party (UK) leadership election, 2016|Labour Party leadership election]].&lt;ref name="doncasterfreepress"&gt;{{cite news |last=Burke|first=Darren|url=https://www.doncasterfreepress.co.uk/news/tv-star-comedians-line-up-for-jeremy-corbyn-rally-in-doncaster-1-8090226|title=TV star comedians line up for Jeremy Corbyn rally in Doncaster|work= |location=Doncaster|publisher=''[[Doncaster Free Press]]''|date=26 August 2016|accessdate=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Hardy was married to American-born actress and comedian [[Kit Hollerbach]], who featured alongside him in the radio sitcoms ''[[Unnatural Acts (radio series)|Unnatural Acts]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epguides.com/UnnaturalActs/ |title=Unnatural Acts (a Titles &amp; Air Dates Guide) |publisher=Epguides.com |date=17 June 2007 |accessdate=14 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''At Home with the Hardys''.&lt;ref name="angelfire1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/pq/radiohaha/HARDYS.html |title=radiohaha – At Home with the Hardys |publisher=Angelfire.com |accessdate=14 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a close friend of comedian [[Linda Smith (comedian)|Linda Smith]]; when she died of [[ovarian cancer]] on 27 February 2006, he publicly eulogised her in many media&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Hardy, Jeremy|title=Her mind was extraordinary|publisher=[[BBC News]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4760038.stm|date=28 February 2006|accessdate=13 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote her ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' obituary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hardy, Jeremy|title=Obituary: Linda Smith|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/obituaries/story/0,,1720290,00.html|date=1 March 2006|accessdate=13 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
