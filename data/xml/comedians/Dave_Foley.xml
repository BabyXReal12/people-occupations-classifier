He played Dave Nelson in the sitcom ''[[NewsRadio]]'', voiced Flik in ''[[A Bug's Life]]'', and hosted the game show ''[[Celebrity Poker Showdown]]''.

== Early life ==
Foley was born in [[Etobicoke]], [[Ontario]], Canada, the son of Mary, a homemaker, and Michael, a [[Pipefitter|steamfitter]]; his mother Mary is from Stafford in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/72/Dave-Foley.html|title=Dave Foley Biography (1963-)|website=www.filmreference.com|access-date=2016-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==

=== Acting and stand-up comedy ===
[[Image:ETalk2008-Kids In The Hall.jpg|thumb|right|255px|The Kids in the Hall at the 2008 Toronto International Film Festival]]
After dropping out of high school, Foley pursued standup comedy for about a year in the [[Toronto]] [[Second City Training Center|Second City Training Centre]], where he began taking improv classes and met [[Kevin McDonald]], who gave him a job as an usher at a local [[art house]] movie theatre. He played Lewis Allen in the [[miniseries]] ''[[Anne of Avonlea (1987 film)|Anne of Avonlea]]''. Foley, McDonald, [[Bruce McCulloch]], [[Mark McKinney]] and [[Scott Thompson (comedian)|Scott Thompson]] formed ''[[The Kids in the Hall]]'', which debuted on television from 1988 to 1995. Foley played some characters, including Hecubus, one of the Sizzler sisters, the A. T. &amp; Love boss, Bruno Puntz Jones, Mr. Heavyfoot, Jocelyn and Lex. Initially involved with ''[[Kids in the Hall: Brain Candy]]'', he left the troupe in the middle of the writing, dissatisfied with the internal strife and the quality of the script, and joined the ''NewsRadio'' cast instead. As he had not signed any contract with the studio, Foley agreed to sign a deal which would allow the rest of the troupe to get paid for the script, though he was convinced that it would never be shot. When it was greenlit, Foley did the film because he was contractually obligated. He is the only member of the group who is uncredited as a writer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/content/node/23064 |title=Interview from June 2004 with The Onion AV Club |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011141427/http://www.avclub.com/content/node/23064 |archivedate=2007-10-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Foley rejoined the troupe in 2000 and has been an integral part of their various reformations. He appeared in the Kids in the Hall 2010 reunion project ''[[Death Comes to Town]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.xtra.ca/public/National/Nothing_is_sacred_in_new_Kids_in_the_Hall_series-8055.aspx|title=Nothing is sacred in new Kids in the Hall series|publisher=[[Xtra!]]|date=December 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Simms]], creator of ''[[NewsRadio]]'', happened to be a huge fan of Foley's work and wrote the role of Dave Nelson specifically for him. Much of his character on the show was based on his own personality quirks, including his coffee addiction and his love of the sitcom ''[[Green Acres]]''.

Foley was recently reunited with ''NewsRadio'' writer [[Joe Furey]] when he recorded the special featurette ''Working with Joe Furey'', an add-on to Furey's comedy ''[[Love and Support]]''. Foley released his stand-up special, ''Relatively Well'' in January 2013, distributed by [[Showtime Network|Showtime]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2523876/fullcredits?ref_=tt_ov_st_sm&lt;/ref&gt; In the comedy-thriller ''[[The Wrong Guy]]'', Foley played Nelson Hibbert, an office worker who finds his boss murdered, mistakenly believes he will be blamed for the crime and runs off as a fugitive.&lt;ref name="avclub"&gt;Rabin. Nathan. The A.V. Club. May 11, 2011. Accessed May 26, 2011. Sad Sack Case File #188: The Wrong Guy http://www.avclub.com/articles/sad-sack-case-file-188-the-wrong-guy,55875/&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, he played the boss of [['N Sync]] singer [[Lance Bass]] in the film ''[[On the Line (2001 film)|On the Line]]''. Foley hosted the [[CBC Television|CBC]] Christmas Special, ''[[The True Meaning of Christmas Specials]]'', in which he, a Mexican [[Elvis impersonator]], [[Elvis Stojko]] and [[Dick Dale]] travel to Canada in search of the true meaning of Christmas specials. He portrayed [[Jack McFarland]]'s boyfriend Stuart Lamarack on ''[[Will &amp; Grace]]'' in its 2003-2004 season. In 2004, Foley became host of ''[[Celebrity Poker Showdown]]'' on [[Bravo (US TV channel)|Bravo]]. In 2007, he appeared nude in [[Uwe Boll]]'s [[Postal (film)|film adaptation]] of the controversial [[personal computer|PC]] game ''[[Postal (video game)|Postal]]'' and became the judge for [[Thank God You're Here (U.S. TV series)|the US version]] of ''[[Thank God You're Here]]''. He portrayed a [[middle management]] employee who happens to be a [[vampire]] in the [[undead]] office comedy ''[[Netherbeast Incorporated]]'' (2007) and voiced the disgruntled [[elf]] Wayne in the holiday special series, ''[[Prep and Landing (series)|Prep &amp; Landing]]''. He also guest-starred in the 2007 special, ''[[Bob &amp; Doug McKenzie's Two-Four Anniversary]]''. He played a high school principal in ''[[It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia]]''. In 2011, he appeared in ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]'' as Marshall's possible future boss, Mr. Bloom. From 2011 to 2012, Foley played Jerry Dunham, the boss of Andrew Carlson ([[David Hornsby]]) in the short-lived CBS sitcom ''[[How to Be a Gentleman]]''. In 2012 and 2013, Foley played Dr. Fulton, [[The Middle (TV series)#Main cast|Brick]]'s ([[Atticus Shaffer]]) school therapist in ''[[The Middle (TV series)|The Middle]]'', where in "Life Skills", he refers to Brick's classmates as "the kids in the hall", after an awkward pause and glance by both characters and mentioning that their behavior is similar to those of [[The Kids in the Hall#Recurring sketches and characters|comedy sketches]] from ''The Kids in the Hall''. In February 2013, Foley played Detective Bob in the [[TV Land]] sitcom, ''[[Hot in Cleveland]]'', starred in the third season of ''[[Robson Arms]]'' on [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] and also starred CTV's new sitcom ''[[Spun Out]]'' in 2014.&lt;ref name="hollywood"&gt;[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/canadas-ctv-orders-dave-foley-426502 "Canada's CTV Orders Dave Foley Comedy 'Spun Out' to Series"].
