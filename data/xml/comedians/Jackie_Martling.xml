Born and raised on [[Long Island]], New York, Martling began a career in stand-up comedy in 1979, developing a [[blue comedy]] act in local venues. He self-produced his first of three comedy albums during this time, ''[[What Did You Expect? (Jackie Martling album)|What Did You Expect?]]'' (1979). After becoming involved with [[Rick Dees]]'s radio show as a regular joke feature, Martling sent his albums to New York City radio personality [[Howard Stern]], who invited him as a weekly guest and writer in 1983. This led to his hiring as head writer from 1986 to 2001. He released further albums during his tenure, including ''[[Sgt. Pecker]]'' (1996), ''[[Joke Man]]'' (1996), ''[[Hot Dogs + Donuts]]'' (1998).

Since his departure from ''The Howard Stern Show'', Martling has undertaken various projects, including acting roles in television and film, and continues to perform stand-up. From 2006 to 2014, he was the host of ''Jackie's Joke Hunt'' on [[Sirius XM Satellite Radio]]. He released his first music album, ''[[Happy Endings (Jackie Martling album)|Happy Endings]]'' (2008). Martling has written two books, ''Disgustingly Dirty Joke Book'' (1998) and ''The Joke Man: Bow to Stern'' (2017).

==Early life==
Martling was born on February 14, 1948 in [[Mineola, New York]], a village on [[Long Island]].{{sfn|Martling|1997|p=16}} The eldest of four children, he is of English, French, and Dutch ancestry.&lt;ref name=herald1999&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1N1-0EB096C0C6E49803.html|title='THE JOKE MAN' - RADIO PERSONALITY TO BRING HIS OFF-COLOR HUMOR TO JOLIET|date=March 7, 1999|newspaper=The Herald News|accessdate=May 12, 2017|via=[[Highbeam Research]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martling took up music at seventh grade and spent time as a gymnast in his youth.&lt;ref name=atlantic2010/&gt; He attended James H. Vernon School in [[East Norwich, New York]] followed by [[Oyster Bay High School]] and, in 1971, earned a [[mechanical engineering]] degree from [[Michigan State University]]. After graduating, he stayed in [[East Lansing, Michigan]] for a further two years.&lt;ref name=herald1999/&gt;&lt;ref name=newsday2013&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsday.com/long-island/towns/bayville-is-heaven-on-earth-for-jackie-the-jokeman-martling-1.5694497|title=Famous Bayville resident's pastime: swimming nude|date=July 15, 2013|work=Newsday|first=Tara|last=Conry|accessdate=May 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his time at university, Martling was the singer and guitarist in a band. He quit the group, and spent six months in [[Denver, Colorado]] working in construction.&lt;ref name=herald1999/&gt;

==Career==

===Early career===
After returning to New York, Martling became the singer and guitarist in The Off-Hour Rockers with guitarist Chris Bates and keyboardist Herbie Werner, with whom incorporated jokes, banjos, and the kazoo in their sets.&lt;ref name=herald1999/&gt; He also performed solo shows and told jokes during his act.&lt;ref name=huffingtonpost2013/&gt; In order to accommodate the band's gear, Martling drove a used [[hearse]]. Martling took stand-up comedy more seriously when, in 1976, he attended an [[open-mic]] night at [[Catch a Rising Star (comedy clubs)|Catch a Rising Star]] comedy club in New York City. "The auditioner bailed out early and the MC wasn't in the room, so I jumped on stage and told a joke, one that I was sure the entire world knew. The MC, David Sayh, came back in the room and saw me up there but let me finish".&lt;ref name=huffingtonpost2013/&gt; Sayh encouraged Martling to continue performing as a joke teller, and soon found out that "few people knew any of the zillions of jokes I knew".&lt;ref name=huffingtonpost2013/&gt;

By 1979, Bates and Werner disbanded the Off Hour Rockers to start a new group. At that point, Martling started to pursue stand-up comedy full-time, developing his stage act of songs and dirty jokes.&lt;ref name=huffingtonpost2013/&gt; During a gig at [[My Father's Place]] in [[Roslyn, New York]], Martling met the likes of comedians [[Eddie Murphy]], [[Rob Bartlett]], and [[Bob Nelson (comedian)|Bob Nelson]] who would perform for several minutes at Martling's gigs.&lt;ref name=huffingtonpost2013/&gt; In 1979, he set up a "dial-a-joke" telephone line from his parent's attic, Jackie's "Use Your Finger! (516) 922-WINE", which remains in operation to this day.&lt;ref name=herald1999/&gt;&lt;ref name=huffingtonpost2013/&gt; Also in 1979, Martling released his first comedy album, ''[[What Did You Expect? (Jackie Martling album)|What Did You Expect?!]]'' (1979), which he recorded himself using his own recording equipment.&lt;ref name=herald1999/&gt;&lt;ref name=tmusic2013/&gt; This was followed by ''[[Goin' Ape!]]'' (1980).
Martling made a breakthrough in 1981 when Dave Lipson, writer and producer of [[Rick Dees]]'s morning radio show on [[KIIS-FM|KIIS]] in Los Angeles, discovered his joke line and played his daily joke updates on Dees's program. The exposure led Martling to star in a designated joke segment for Dees, who went on give Martling his nickname, "The Joke Man". Also in 1981, Martling released his third album, ''[[Normal People Are People You Don't Know That Well]]'' (1981).

===''The Howard Stern Show''===
Martling first heard of radio personality [[Howard Stern]] in August 1982 when the owner of Garvin's comedy club in Washington, D.C., where Stern performed during his time at [[WWDC (FM)|WWDC]], suggested to Martling that he send his comedy albums to him.&lt;ref name=huffingtonpost2013&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-debellis/jackie-martling-interview_b_3025798.html|title=Jackie Martling Interview|first=John|last=DeBellis|date=April 8, 2013|work=Huffington Post|accessdate=May 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=laughspin2011/&gt; By early 1983, Martling had mailed his three comedy albums to [[Howard Stern]], then less than a year into his stint in afternoons at [[WNBC (AM)|WNBC]] in New York City.&lt;ref name=laughspin2011/&gt; Stern took a liking to his material and invited him on as a guest in February 1983, which soon turned into a weekly guest spot without pay.&lt;ref name=herald1999/&gt;&lt;ref name=huffingtonpost2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=laughspin2011/&gt; Stern then began a regular segment titled "Stump The Comedian", a contest where callers were challenged to start a joke that Martling had to provide the punchline to, otherwise they win prizes.&lt;ref name=laughspin2011/&gt;

In 1985, following the show's cancellation from WNBC, Stern stayed in New York City and relocated to afternoons on [[WXRK (FM)|WXRK]]. Martling was subsequently hired as a writer on ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'' when it moved to the mornings slot in February 1986, initially for two days a week. After around two months, Martling was hired full-time&lt;ref name=laughspin2011/&gt; and became known as the head writer who would take lines written by himself and sound effects and producer [[Fred Norris]] and "determine what goes in front of Howard".&lt;ref name=herald1999/&gt; Along with Norris, Martling contributed material to radio bits and song parodies and is featured and credited on [[Howard Stern television shows|Stern's television shows]], [[Howard Stern videography and discography|home videos, and albums]]. In 1994, a puppet that resembled Martling, known on the show as the "Jackie puppet", began to feature on ''[[Howard Stern (E! show)|Howard Stern]]'' on the [[E!]] channel and voiced by show impressionist [[Billy West]].

Martling would release further albums during his time on the show, including ''[[Sgt. Pecker]]'' (1996), ''[[Joke Man]]'' (1996), ''[[Hot Dogs + Donuts]]'' (1998), and ''[[F Jackie]]'' (2000).

In early 1998, Martling was absent on the show for six weeks while his contract with WXRK owner [[Infinity Broadcasting Corporation]] was being renegotiated. During this time, he refused to be filmed on the E! television show until he had also secured a contract from the channel.&lt;ref name=chicago2001/&gt; Martling had taken time off to negotiate his contract "three or four times" throughout his time on the show.&lt;ref name=newsday2017&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newsday.com/entertainment/books/howard-stern-show-writer-jackie-the-joke-man-martling-talks-about-his-new-book-1.14510097|title=Jackie 'The Joke Man' Martling talks new book|work=Newsday|first=David J.|last=Criblez|date=18 October 2017|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2001, Martling made history when he became the first comedian to perform at the B.B. King Blues Club in New York City.&lt;ref name=nypost2001&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2001/02/23/joke-man-cometh-jackie-martling-has-a-talent-for-tasteless-but-its-all-just-good-dirty-fun/|title=JOKE MAN COMETH â€“ JACKIE MARTLING HAS A TALENT FOR TASTELESS â€“ BUT ITâ€™S ALL JUST GOOD DIRTY FUN|date=February 23, 2001|work=The New York Post|accessdate=May 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 5, 2001, Stern announced Martling's departure from the show after negotiations fell through once more.&lt;ref name=chicago2001&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4578461.html|title=Stern, 'Joke Man' part ways|date=March 9, 2001|work=Chicago Sun-Times|first=Phil|last=Rosenthal|accessdate=May 12, 2017|via=[[Highbeam Research]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=laughspin2011&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laughspin.com/the-laughsin-interview-jackie-martling-talks-howard-stern-artie-lange-and-why-he-left-radios-best-job/|title=The Laughsin interview: Jackie Martling talks Howard Stern, Artie Lange and why he left radio's best job|first=Scott|last=King|publisher=Laughspin|accessdate=May 11, 2017|date=August 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martling, who was earning $578,000 at the time, asked for $1 million for the next five years, but took his lawyer's advice and declined the station's final offer of $650,000. The deadline to accept having passed, Martling twice attempted to accept the offer but was declined.&lt;ref name=nydailynews2017/&gt; He has since added other reasons to his departure, including his inability to sleep and perform effectively for the show, having to announce his failing marriage on the air, and the inability to address his alcohol abuse had he continued.&lt;ref name=nydailynews2017&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/amp/entertainment/gossip/confidential/jackie-martling-opens-split-howard-stern-article-1.3577603|title=Jackie Martling opens up on his split from Howard Stern|work=New York Daily News|first=Nicki|last=Gostin|date=21 October 2017|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=laughspin2011/&gt; In August 2001, a newspaper reported his wish to return, but Stern declined, partly due to the Win Jackie's Money contest he had already started, which involved comedians auditioning for Martling's place in the studio by sitting in on some shows. In October 2001, comedian and actor [[Artie Lange]] replaced Martling for a tenure that lasted until December 2009.
