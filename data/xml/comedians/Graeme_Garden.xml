&lt;!--NO "Dr" PER WP:MOSBIO--&gt;'''David Graeme Garden''' [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] (born 18 February 1943) is an English comedian, actor, author, artist and television presenter, best known as a member of [[The Goodies]] and for being a cast member on ''[[I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue]]''.

==Early life and education==
[[File:ReptonSchool2007.JPG|thumb|left|Repton School]]
Born in [[Aberdeen]], Scotland, he grew up in [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]], England. Garden was educated at [[Repton School]], and studied medicine at [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge]], where he joined the prestigious [[Footlights|Cambridge University Footlights Club]] (of which he became President in 1964), and performed with the 1964 Footlights revue, ''Stuff What Dreams Are Made Of'' at the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]].

Garden qualified in medicine at [[King's College London]], but has never practised.&lt;ref name="WINKLER-2005" /&gt; Asked how he justified making jokes rather than saving lives, he answered:

{{Quote|I don't think I would have done it as well. It's an interesting question – whether you've contributed more to the vast store of human enjoyment by doing comedy or by being a doctor, but the answer for me is that I don't think I would have been as successful or as happy being a doctor.&lt;ref name="WINKLER-2005"&gt;

==Career==

===Radio===

Garden was co-writer and performer in the classic BBC [[radio comedy]] sketch show, ''[[I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again]]'', in the late 1960s. Garden was studying medicine during the early seasons of ''I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again'', and this commitment made it difficult for him to be a member of the cast during the third season because of a midwifery medical course in [[Plymouth]]. However, he continued sending scripts for the radio show by mail – and rejoined the cast upon his return to his medical studies in London.&lt;ref&gt;''From Fringe to Flying Circus'' – 'Celebrating a Unique Generation of Comedy 1960–1980' – Roger Wilmut, Eyre Methuen Ltd, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;  On several occasions his medical qualifications are lampooned; in the 25th Anniversary Show, David Hatch asks him if he is still a writer. Garden: "Here's something I wrote this morning". Hatch: "It's a prescription". "Yes," says Garden, "but it's a funny one..."

Garden is a permanent panellist on the long-running BBC Radio improvisation show ''[[I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue]]'' in a cast which includes [[Tim Brooke-Taylor]]. He also stars in and co-writes, with [[Barry Cryer]], ''[[Hamish and Dougal|You'll Have Had Your Tea]]'', a direct spin-off of ISIHAC, and has contributed to several books from the series including guides to the game [[Mornington Crescent (game)|Mornington Crescent]].

Garden wrote for and appeared with [[Barry Cryer]] and [[Alison Steadman]] in the 1989 BBC radio comedy sketch show ''[[The Long Hot Satsuma]]''. In 2001 and 2002, Garden wrote for and appeared in the BBC radio comedy sketch show ''The Right Time'', along with [[Eleanor Bron]], [[Paula Wilcox]], [[Clive Swift]], Roger Blake and [[Neil Innes]]. He was also script editor for ''[[The Hudson and Pepperdine Show]]''.

Garden is chair of the spoof radio game show ''Beat the Kids''. He has also appeared on the UK version of the improvisation television series ''[[Whose Line Is It Anyway? (UK TV series)|Whose Line Is It Anyway?]]'', which has a similar format. He was a co-writer of the BBC Radio 4 comedy ''[[Giles Wemmbley-Hogg Goes Off]]'', and in 2006, Garden co-devised and appeared on the [[BBC Radio 4]] comedy quiz show, ''[[The Unbelievable Truth (radio show)|The Unbelievable Truth]]''.

In 2003, Garden wrote the Radio 4 sitcom ''[[About a Dog]]'', based on an original idea by [[Debbie Barham]], with a second series in 2007.

Garden has appeared in two of [[Big Finish Productions|Big Finish]]'s ''[[Doctor Who]]'' audio dramas playing a parodic character. In ''[[Bang-Bang-a-Boom!]]'' he plays Professor Fassbinder, a parody of [[Victor Bergman]] in ''[[Space: 1999]]''. In ''[[Max Warp]]'' he plays TV presenter Geoffrey Vantage, parodying ''[[Top Gear (current format)|Top Gear]]'' presenter [[Jeremy Clarkson]]. He also plays Abbot Thelonious (an alias of the [[Meddling Monk]]) in the [[Eighth Doctor]] audio play ''[[The Book of Kells (Doctor Who audio)|The Book of Kells]]'' in 2010, and subsequently returns as a recurring antagonist to the Eighth Doctor.

===Television===
Garden's best known television work is freeform sitcom ''[[The Goodies (TV series)|The Goodies]]'', which he wrote and performed along with [[Tim Brooke-Taylor]] and [[Bill Oddie]] from 1970 to 1982. The three appeared in the Amnesty International show ''[[A Poke In The Eye (With A Sharp Stick)]]'' (during which they sang their hit song "[[Funky Gibbon]]"). Garden and [[Bill Oddie]] co-wrote many episodes of the television sitcom ''[[Doctor in the House (TV series)|Doctor in the House]]'', including most of the first series episodes, and all of the second series episodes - as well as co-writing episodes of the subsequent ''[[Doctor at Large (TV series)|Doctor at Large]]'' and ''[[Doctor in Charge]]'' series. Garden was co-writer and performer in the sketch show ''[[Twice a Fortnight]]'' with [[Bill Oddie]], [[Terry Jones]], [[Michael Palin]] and [[Jonathan Lynn]], and also sketch show ''[[Broaden Your Mind]]'' with [[Tim Brooke-Taylor]], with [[Bill Oddie]] joining the cast for the second series.

In 1982 Garden and Oddie wrote, but did not perform in, a six-part science fiction sitcom called ''[[Astronauts (television)|Astronauts]]'' for [[Central Independent Television|Central]] which was shown on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]. The show was set in an international [[space station]] in the near future.

Garden was the voice of the title character in ''[[Bananaman]]'' (1983), in addition to General Blight and Maurice of the Heavy Mob in the children's [[animated]] television comedy series, which also featured the rest of the Goodies team. The series parodied comic book super-heroes. Later, Garden wrote for the sitcom ''[[Surgical Spirit]]'' (1994). Graeme Garden has also presented three series of the [[BBC]]'s health magazine ''Bodymatters''.

Garden appeared in the political sitcom ''[[Yes Minister]]'', in the role of Commander Forrest of the Special Branch in the episode ''The Death List''. He also appeared as a television presenter in the ''[[Doctor in the House (TV series)|Doctor in the House]]'' episode, ''Doctor on the Box''.

He was a regular team captain on the political satire game show ''[[If I Ruled the World (game show)|If I Ruled the World]]''. Brooke-Taylor appeared as a guest in one episode and during the game "I Couldn't Disagree More" he proposed that it was high time ''The Goodies'' episodes were repeated. Garden was obliged by the rules of the game to refute this statement, and replied, "I couldn't disagree more... it was time to repeat them ten, fifteen years ago."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gNG4dsOX6c |title=If I Ruled the World clip #1 |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2012-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Garden and Brooke-Taylor were co-presenters of [[Channel 4]]'s daytime game show ''Beat the Nation'', in which they indulged in usual game show "banter", but took the quiz itself seriously. It was notable for its use of a "laugh track" instead of a studio audience. Garden has hosted the quiz game ''[[Tell the Truth (UK game show)|Tell the Truth]]'' and presented a series of history programmes, ''A Sense of the Past'' for [[Yorkshire Television]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Best Medicine: Graeme Garden's Book of Medical Humour'', compiled and illustrated by Graeme Garden, published by Robson Books Ltd., London (1984), {{ISBN|0-86051-295-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Garden writes and directs for the corporate video company [[Video Arts]], famous for its training films starring [[John Cleese]].

===Stage appearances===

Garden has a successful stage career, and has acted in several [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]] productions, as well as London's [[West End of London|West End]]. He has also acted in several [[BBC Radio 4]] comedy drama series, and television drama including ''Peak Practice'' and ''[[Holby City]]''. He appeared in ''[[Bang-Bang-a-Boom!]]'', a spin-off audio drama based on the BBC science fiction television series ''[[Doctor Who]]'' by [[Big Finish Productions]]. Garden appeared with Tim Brooke-Taylor in the theatre production ''[[The Unvarnished Truth]]''.

In 1986 he appeared in a production of [[An Inspector Calls]] by [[J B Priestley]] at the [[Royal Exchange, Manchester]].

Garden wrote a play called ''[[The Pocket Orchestra]]'' which ran in London in 2006. In August 2006, Garden and Brooke-Taylor joined up to perform at the [[Edinburgh Fringe]] in a show which looked back with some nostalgia to their work with the Goodies and in light entertainment.

== Personal life ==
Garden lives in [[Oxfordshire]] with his wife Emma, with whom he has a son, Tom. Garden also has a daughter, Sally, and a son, John, from his previous marriage to Mary Elizabeth Wheatley Grice.&lt;ref&gt;"''Who's Who on Television''" – Independent Television Books, London, England (1985). {{ISBN|0-907965-31-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"''Who's Who on Television''" – Independent Television Books, London, England (1988). {{ISBN|0-907965-49-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His son John "JJ" Garden is the occasional keyboardist for the music group [[Scissor Sisters#Line-up|Scissor Sisters]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/families/article1448753.ece | work=The Times | location=London | title=Relative Values Graeme Garden and his son John | date=March 4, 2007 | accessdate=May 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and shares songwriting credit on their 2006 album [[Ta-Dah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/style/living/article60476.ece|title=Relative Values: Graeme Garden and his son, John|work=The Sunday Times |date=4 March 2007 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garden's father, Robert Symon Garden, was an eminent orthopaedic surgeon who created the Garden classification of hip fractures and the Garden screw, used to repair certain hip fractures.

In 2002, Garden suffered an episode of the condition known as [[Bell's palsy]], where the muscles on one side of the face become paralysed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bellspalsy.org.uk/graeme-garden.htm Famous sufferers - Bell's Palsy UK website]&lt;/ref&gt; He was able to continue his work commitments and made a full recovery.

Garden was appointed [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] (OBE) in the [[2011 Birthday Honours]] for services to light entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=59808 |date=11 June 2011 |page=10 |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;
