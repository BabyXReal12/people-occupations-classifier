'''Ruth Draper''' (December 2, 1884{{spaced ndash}}December 30, 1956) was an [[United States|American]] [[actress]], [[dramatist]] and noted [[Monologist#Diseuse|diseuse]]&lt;ref&gt;Sir John Gielgud: A Life in Letters By John Gielgud - 2005 pg. 516&lt;/ref&gt; who specialized in character-driven [[monologue]]s and [[monodrama]]. Her best-known pieces include ''The Italian Lesson'', ''Three Women and Mr. Clifford'', ''Doctors and Diets'', and ''A Church in Italy''.

==Early life and family==

Ruth Draper was born in [[New York City]], the youngest child of Dr. William Henry and Ruth (née Dana) Draper. Her father, who was born in [[Brattleboro, Vermont]],&lt;ref&gt;US Passport Application - December 2, 1884&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Atlanta Constitution April 27, 1901&lt;/ref&gt; had the affluence to support a large family with the help of several servants.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;US Census records 1860, 1870, 1880, 1900&lt;/ref&gt; Ruth Draper's mother was the daughter of [[Charles Anderson Dana]], editor and publisher of ''[[The New York Sun]]'' and had married Dr. Draper in 1878 some years after the loss of his first wife, Lucy.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Bridgeport Post, December 31, 1956 pg. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Her nephew, [[Paul Draper (dancer)|Paul Draper]], was a noted dancer and actor. Draper's second cousin was the society architect Paul Phipps, father of [[UK|British]] actress [[Joyce Grenfell]] (Grenfell's career as a monologist was directly inspired by Draper). Her nephew [[Raimund Sanders Draper]] was a heroic WWII pilot.&lt;ref name="Letters"&gt;{{Cite book

==Career==

Ruth Draper's inspiration to become an actress came from the Polish [[pianist]] [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski]], a friend of her family.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;The Ottawa Citizen December 31, 1956&lt;/ref&gt; She made her [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] debut in the 1916 play ''A Lady's Name'' by [[Cyril Harcourt]],&lt;ref&gt;IBDb.com&lt;/ref&gt; and by 1921 was becoming well known as monologist, or more specifically diseuse, appearing in [[monodrama]]s.

Thus, Draper dominated the field of professional solo performance during the second quarter of the twentieth century, performing with great success throughout the United States and Europe. Draper's one-person shows differed in kind from the majority of the early lyceum and [[Chautauqua]] solo performers coming before her, as the monologues/monodramas she performed were original characters as opposed to selections of published literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cast of One|last=Gentile|first=John S.|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=1989|isbn=|location=Urbana and Chicago|pages=104-105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With a chair, shawl and occasional table as her only [[Theatrical property|props]], Draper entertained audiences in a half dozen languages worldwide for nearly forty years.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Her best-known pieces include ''The Italian Lesson'', ''Three Women and Mr. Clifford'', ''Doctors and Diets'', and ''A Church in Italy''.

Such theatre legends as [[George Bernard Shaw]], [[Thornton Wilder]], [[John Gielgud]], [[Katharine Hepburn]], [[Maurice Chevalier]], [[Laurence Olivier]], and [[Uta Hagen]] were among those dazzled by Draper's artistry and talent, as were authors [[Henry James]], [[Henry Brooks Adams|Henry Adams]], [[Edith Wharton]] and [[Agatha Christie]]. Draper inspired characters in two of Christie's works — Carlotta Adams in the 1933 novel ''[[Lord Edgware Dies]]'',&lt;ref&gt;In her ''[[Agatha Christie: An Autobiography|Autobiography]]'', Christie says, "I thought how clever she was and how good her impersonations were; the wonderful way she could transform herself from a nagging wife to a peasant girl kneeling in a cathedral. Thinking about her led me to the book ''Lord Edgware Dies''." Christie, Agatha. ''An Autobiography'' (p. 437). Collins, 1977; {{ISBN|0-00-216012-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and Aspasia Glen in the short story "[[The Mysterious Mr Quin#The Dead Harlequin|The Dead Harlequin]]".

In 1951 [[George VI|King George VI of the United Kingdom]] awarded Ruth Draper [[Title of honor|honor]]ary membership in the [[Order of the British Empire]] with the rank of [[Commander]] (CBE). On April 29, 1953, she had lunch with C. S. Lewis the day after he saw her performance at the New Theatre in Oxford. Nearly a quarter century earlier she gave a performance at [[Windsor Castle]] after an invitation from [[George V|King George V]] and [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]].&lt;ref&gt;The New York Times December 19, 1951 pg. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

Draper had many relationships in [[Italy]], in large part through her connection with [[Lauro De Bosis]], a young Italian poet and writer who died in 1931 after a daring flight over [[Rome]] during which he threw thousands of leaflets denouncing [[Benito Mussolini]] and the [[National Fascist Party]].

==Death==

Ruth Draper died on December 30, 1956, of an apparent [[heart attack]],&lt;ref&gt;The New York Times December 31, 1956 pg. 13&lt;/ref&gt; just hours after giving a performance on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] at the Playhouse Theatre. Draper's family had a summer home in [[Islesboro, Maine]], which she purchased from her family and where she spent increasing amounts of time in her later years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.workingwaterfront.com/articles/How-Brilliant-She-Was--Islesboros-Ruth-Draper-had-an-Uncanny-Ability-to-Impersonate-People/10198/printer-friendly/ Ruth Draper]&lt;/ref&gt; A short biography of Draper is among several collected by the Anglo-Italian writer [[Iris Origo]] in her 1984 book, ''A Need to Testify''.

==Recordings==
Recordings of Draper's monologues have influenced many contemporary writers and performers, including [[Joyce Grenfell]], [[Lily Tomlin]], [[Mike Nichols]], [[Julie Harris (American actress)|Julie Harris]], [[Simon Callow]], [[Emma Thompson]], [[Charles Busch]], [[David Mamet]], [[Julia Sweeney]], [[Annette Bening]], [[Maureen Lipman]] and [[John Lithgow]].
