Gervais worked initially in the music industry, attempting a career as a pop star in the 1980s as the singer of the [[new wave music|new wave]] act [[Seona Dancing]] and working as the manager of the then-unknown band [[Suede (band)|Suede]] before turning to comedy. Gervais appeared on ''[[The 11 O'Clock Show]]'' on Channel 4 between 1998 and 2000. In 2000, he was given a [[Channel 4]] talk show, ''[[Meet Ricky Gervais]]'', and then achieved greater mainstream fame a year later with his BBC television series ''[[The Office (UK TV series)|The Office]]''. It was followed by ''[[Extras (TV series)|Extras]]'' in 2005. He co-wrote and co-directed both series with [[Stephen Merchant]]. In addition to writing and directing the shows, he played the lead roles of [[David Brent]] in ''The Office'' and [[Andy Millman]] in ''Extras''. He reprised his role as Brent in the comedy film ''[[Life on the Road]]''.

Gervais began his stand-up career in the late 1990s. He has performed five multi-national stand-up comedy tours and wrote the ''[[Flanimals]]'' book series. Gervais, Merchant and [[Karl Pilkington]] created the [[podcast]], ''[[The Ricky Gervais Show]]'', which has spawned various spin-offs starring Pilkington and produced by Gervais and Merchant.&lt;ref name="Plunkett"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://media.guardian.co.uk/site/story/0,,1703591,00.html|title=Gervais podcast in the record books|work=[[The Guardian]]|first=John|last=Plunkett|date=6 February 2006|accessdate=27 March 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has also starred in the Hollywood films ''[[Ghost Town (2008 film)|Ghost Town]]'', and ''[[Muppets Most Wanted]]'', and wrote, directed and starred in ''[[The Invention of Lying]]'' and the [[Netflix]] released ''[[Special Correspondents]]''. He hosted the [[Golden Globe Awards]] in 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2016, and appears on the game show ''[[Child Support (U.S. game show)|Child Support]]''.

Gervais has won seven [[BAFTA Awards]], five [[British Comedy Awards]], two [[Emmy Awards]], three [[Golden Globe Awards]] and the 2006 [[Rose d'Or]], as well as a [[Screen Actors Guild Award]] nomination. In a 2004 poll for the BBC, he was named the third most influential person in [[Culture of the United Kingdom|British culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=iPod designer voted UK's most influential cultural icon|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/02/12/ipod_designer_voted_uks_most/|agency=The Register|date=17 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, he was voted the 11th greatest stand-up comic on [[Channel 4]]'s 100 Greatest Stand-Ups&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/100_greatest_stand_ups/episodes/1/1/|title=Episode 1.1 The 100 Greatest Stand-Ups 2007|publisher=Comedy.co.uk|accessdate =25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and again in the updated 2010 list as the 3rd greatest stand-up comic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/100_greatest_stand_ups/episodes/1/2/|title=Episode 1.2 The 100 Greatest Stand-Ups 2010|publisher=Comedy.co.uk|accessdate =25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, he was named on the ''[[Time 100]]'' list of the world's most influential people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2058044_2060338_2060076,00.html|title=Ricky Gervais The 2010 Time 100 Poll|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate=25 January 2015|date=4 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Gervais was born at [[Battle Hospital]] in [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]]. He was raised in [[Whitley, Berkshire|Whitley]], along with brother Larry (born 1945), sister Marsha (born 1948), and brother Robert (born 1950).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/ricky-gervais-a-lucky-man-lurks-behind-david-brent--but-just-who-is-he-611664.html |title=Ricky Gervais: A lucky man lurks behind David Brent – but just who is he? |work=[[The Independent]] |location=UK |date=21 December 2002 |accessdate=24 September 2010 |first=Robert |last=Hanks |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090905174339/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/ricky-gervais-a-lucky-man-lurks-behind-david-brent--but-just-who-is-he-611664.html |archivedate=5 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Lawrence Raymond "Jerry" Gervais (1919–2002), a [[Franco-Ontarian]] from [[Pain Court, Ontario]], emigrated while on foreign duty during the [[Second World War]] and worked as a labourer and hod carrier.&lt;ref name="telegraphuk"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/comedy/8722858/Ricky-Gervais-Dont-ask-me-the-price-of-milk-I-fly-by-private-jet.html |title=Ricky Gervais: Don’t ask me the price of milk - I fly by private jet |newspaper=The Telegraph |date=26 August 2011 |first=Bryony |last=Gordon |accessdate=28 August 2014 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; He met Gervais' mother, Eva Sophia (''née'' House; 1925–2000),&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/megan-smolenyak-smolenyak/you-asked-for-it-ricky-ge_b_531001.html|title=You Asked for It, Ricky Gervais!|publisher=The Huffington Post|date=8 April 2010|first=Megan|last=Smolenyak|accessdate=24 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was [[English people|English]], during a [[Blackout (wartime)|blackout]]; they settled in Whitley.

He attended Whitley Park Infants and Junior Schools, and received his secondary education at Ashmead Comprehensive School; after a spell as a gardener at the [[University of Reading]], he moved on to [[University College London]] in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heatley|2006|pages=23, 28}}{{clarify|reason=no matching full citation;|date=April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Francesca Perryman |url=http://www.getreading.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/happy-birthday-ricky-gervais-plus-11516111 |title=Happy Birthday Ricky Gervais!

==Career==

===Music===
In 1983, during his final year as a student at UCL (University College London), Gervais and college friend [[Bill Macrae]] formed the [[New wave music|new wave]] pop [[Musical ensemble|duo]], [[Seona Dancing]]. They were signed by [[London Records]], which released two of their singles—"[[More to Lose]]" and "[[Bitter Heart (song)|Bitter Heart]]". The songs failed to chart inside the UK top 75.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=David Roberts |title=British Hit Singles and Albums|year=2006|publisher=Guinness World Records Limited|isbn=978-1904994107}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite not being successful in the UK, Seona Dancing did manage to score a hit in the [[Philippines]] with "More to Lose".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2011/01/26/ricky_gervais_pop_band/|title=Ricky Gervais' career as an 80's glam-pop star|publisher=Salon|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also worked as the manager for [[Suede (band)|Suede]] before they became successful in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/showbiz/news/a321491/brett-anderson-praises-ex-manager-ricky-gervais.html#~p2t6TtO7XcwBvE|title=Brent Anderson Praises Ex-manager Ricky Gervais|publisher=Digital Spy|first=Tom |last=Eames|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Gervais performed a live tour as [[David Brent]] along with a band under the name "Foregone Conclusion". Gervais and the band performed songs written under the Brent character including songs such as "Equality Street" and "[[Free Love Freeway]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/various-artists/73215 |title=Ricky Gervais plays debut David Brent show with former Razorlight star in London |work=[[NME]] |date=14 October 2013 |accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gervais also produced a series of YouTube videos under the title 'Learn Guitar with David Brent', featuring acoustic guitar versions of nine songs.

In 2016, as part of the ''Life on Road'' film promotion, Gervais published the ''David Brent Songbook'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B01HBPUIC6/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1 |title=David Brent Songbook eBook: David Brent: Amazon.co.uk: Kindle Store |publisher=Amazon.co.uk |date= |accessdate=10 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; containing 15 songs. These were also recorded for the album ''Life on the Road'', under the name of David Brent and Foregone Conclusion.

===Radio===
Gervais worked as an [[event management|assistant events manager]] for the [[University of London Union]] (ULU), then moved from ULU to a job as head of speech at the alternative radio station [[XFM|Xfm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/comedy/2010/12/ricky-gervais-ince-office|title=Ricky Gervais: They Call Me Entertainment|work=[[New Statesman]]|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Needing an assistant, Gervais interviewed the first person whose ''[[curriculum vitae]]'' he saw. It belonged to [[Stephen Merchant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/14/arts/television/14gervais.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|title=Three Mates Laughing (Well, Two Are) |work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=25 January 2015|first=Dave|last=Itzkoff|date=12 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998 Gervais was made [[Layoff|redundant]] when the station was taken over by the [[Capital Radio]] group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cityoffilms.com/reel-news/the-podfather-ricky-gervais/|title=XFM &amp; The Podfather: Ricky Gervais Week|work=City of Film|first=Graham|last=McMorrow|accessdate=21 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150121193147/http://www.cityoffilms.com/reel-news/the-podfather-ricky-gervais/|archivedate=21 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around this time he was also a regular contributor to [[Mary Anne Hobbs]]' Radio 1 show, performing vox pop interviews in unlikely locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Worthington |first=Tim |date=2012 |title=Fun At One: The Story Of Comedy At BBC Radio 1 |url= |location= |publisher=Lulu Press |page= |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the first series of ''[[The Office (UK TV series)|The Office]]'', Gervais and Merchant returned to [[Xfm]] in November 2001 for a Saturday radio show. This was when the pair first worked with [[Karl Pilkington]], who produced the shows and later collaborated with them on their series of [[podcast]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gigwise.com/news/5930/ricky-gervais-and-stephen-merchant-return-to-xfm|title=Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant Return to Xfm|work=Gigwise |accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2017, Gervais began hosting the weekly radio show ''Ricky Gervais Is Deadly Sirius'' on [[Sirius XM Holdings|Sirius XM]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Spangler|first1=Todd|title=Ricky Gervais on New SiriusXM Talk Show: They ‘Made Me an Offer I Couldn’t Refuse’|url=https://variety.com/2017/digital/news/ricky-gervais-siriusxm-comedy-talk-show-1202593641/|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=21 October 2017|date=18 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Podcast====
{{See also|The Ricky Gervais Show|List of The Ricky Gervais Show episodes}}
On 5 December 2005, ''[[Guardian Unlimited]]'' began offering free weekly [[podcast]]s, including ''[[The Ricky Gervais Show]]'' featuring Gervais, Merchant, and [[Karl Pilkington]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4479230.stm|title=Gervais radio show to be podcast |date= 28 November 2005|publisher=BBC|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout January and February 2006 the podcast was consistently ranked the number-one podcast in the world; it appeared in the 2007 [[Guinness World Record]] for the world's most-downloaded podcast, having gained an average of 261,670 downloads per episode during its first month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/feb/06/radio.newmedia|title=Gervais podcast in the record books|work=The Guardian|accessdate=4 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two more series—each with six podcasts—were released between February and September 2006.

In late 2006, three more free podcasts were released. Together called "The Podfather Trilogy", they debuted individually at Halloween, Thanksgiving and Christmas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Podfather-Trilogy-Season-Gervais/dp/B002SPXUZC|title=The Podfather Trilogy|publisher=Amazon.co.uk|accessdate=31 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These three were known by Ricky and Steve as "The Fourth Season". In October 2007 another free full-length podcast was released through iTunes; this podcast was originally given out for free during a performance of Gervais' ''[[Fame (comedy)|Fame]]'' stand-up tour in London. On 25 November 2007 Gervais, Merchant and Pilkington released another free full-length podcast, which lasted just over an hour.

In August 2008, Gervais, Merchant and Pilkington recorded their fifth season of [[audiobook]]s, totaling 4 chapters, which were released on 16 September 2008. These audiobooks were described as the 'guide to...' series, covering several topics. As of May 2011, there are 12 "Guides" in total: Medicine, Natural History, Arts, Philosophy, The English, Society, Law &amp; Order, The Future, The Human Body, The Earth, The [[World Cup 2010]], and [[Comic Relief]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;field-keywords=The+ricky+gervais+guide+to|title=The Ricky Gervais Guide to...|publisher=Amazon.co.uk|accessdate=31 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conversations typically begin on topic, but constantly stray away from the topic at hand.

===Television===

====Early television appearances====
[[File:RickyGervaisBAFTA07.jpg|thumb|upright|Gervais at the [[60th British Academy Film Awards]] in 2007]]
Gervais has contributed to the [[BAFTA]]-winning ''[[The Sketch Show]]'' (ITV), penning several sketches. His mainstream-TV debut came in September 1998 as part of [[Channel 4]]'s "Comedy Lab" series of pilots. His one-off show ''[[Golden Years (TV programme)|Golden Years]]'' focused on a [[David Bowie]]–obsessed character called Clive Meadows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/pictures/the-long-funny-career-of-ricky-gervais-20110404/golden-years-1998-0520409Aa|title=The Long, Funny Career of Ricky Gervais|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|first=Tom |last=Eames|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gervais then came to much wider national attention with an obnoxious, cutting persona featured in a topical slot that replaced [[Ali G]]'s segments on the satirical Channel 4 comedy programme ''[[The 11 O'Clock Show]]'' in early 1999, in which his character used as many [[Profanity|expletive]]s as was possible and produced an inordinate amount of politically incorrect statements. Among the other regular featured comedians on the show was [[Mackenzie Crook]], later a co-star of ''[[The Office (UK TV series)|The Office]]''. Two years later, Gervais went on to present his own comedy chat show for Channel 4 called ''[[Meet Ricky Gervais]]''; it was poorly received and has since been mocked by Gervais himself.

Throughout this time, Gervais also wrote for the BBC sketch show ''[[Bruiser (TV series)|Bruiser]]'' and ''The [[Jim Tavare]] Show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/people/ricky_gervais_person_page.shtml|title=Comedy People A-Z Ricky Gervais

====''The Office''====
{{Main|The Office (UK TV series)}}
''[[The Office (UK TV series)|The Office]]'' started when [[Stephen Merchant]], while on a BBC production course, had to make his own short film. In August 1999 he made a docu-soap parody, set in an office, with help from [[Ash Atalla]], who was shown a 7-minute video called 'The Seedy Boss'. Thus [[David Brent]] was created. Merchant passed this tape on to the BBC's Head of Entertainment [[Paul Jackson (producer)|Paul Jackson]] at the [[Edinburgh Fringe]], who then passed it on to Head of Comedy [[Jon Plowman]], who eventually commissioned a full-pilot script from Merchant and Gervais.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/profiles/story/0,,1250074,.html|title=The Guardian profile: Ricky Gervais
|work=The Guardian|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first six-episode series of ''The Office'' aired in the UK in July and August 2001 to little fanfare or attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msn.com/en-ph/entertainment/people/ricky-gervais/AA3l0x9|title=Ricky Gervais| publisher=[[MSN]] |accessdate=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Word-of-mouth, repeats, and DVDs helped spread the word, building up momentum and anticipation for the second series, also comprising six episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/profiles/story/0,,1250074,.html|title=The Guardian profile: Ricky Gervais|work=The Guardian|date=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the success of ''The Office''{{'s}} second series, Gervais was named the [[Radio Times's Most Powerful People in TV Comedy|most powerful person in TV comedy]] by ''[[Radio Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/2631307.stm|title=Gervais crowned 'king of comedy'|date=6 January 2003|publisher=BBC News|location=London|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6tRevTA3J?url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2631307.stm|archivedate=13 September 2017|dead-url=no|accessdate=13 September 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, ''The Office'' won the [[Golden Globe]]s for Best Television Series – Musical or Comedy and Best Performance by an Actor in a Television Series – Musical or Comedy for Gervais, who said in a 2015 BBC interview that the award was the gateway to America for him.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Citation|last=Husam sam Asi|title=What does Ricky Gervais really think of the Golden Globes? - Interview|date=16 January 2016|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfbPlRseDPU|accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Office]]'' brand has since been remade for audiences in [[:sv:Kontoret|Sweden]], [[Le Bureau|France]], [[Stromberg (TV series)|Germany]], [[La Job|Quebec]], [[Os Aspones|Brazil]] and the [[The Office (U.S. TV series)|United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://splitsider.com/2011/05/exploring-the-international-franchises-of-the-office/|title=Exploring the International Franchises of The Office|publisher=Splitsider.com|accessdate=27 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gervais and Merchant are producers of the American version, and they also co-wrote the episode "[[The Convict]]" for the show's third season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4687784.stm|title=Gervais writing US Office episode|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=25 January 2015|date=7 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gervais has said that the episode "[[Episode Four (The Office, Series One)|Training]]" is his favourite, where Brent plays his guitar and sings.

====''Extras''====
{{Main|Extras (TV series)}}
[[Extras (TV series)|''Extras'']] had its debut on the BBC on 21 July 2005; directed by Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant, the sitcom ran for twelve episodes and starred Gervais as Andy Millman, a [[Extra (actor)|background artist]]. Millman is more self-aware and intentionally humorous than Gervais' ''The Office'' character David Brent. Guest stars on the first series of ''Extras'' include [[Ross Kemp]], [[Les Dennis]], [[Patrick Stewart]], [[Vinnie Jones]], [[Samuel L. Jackson]], [[Ben Stiller]], [[Kate Winslet]] and [[Francesca Martinez]]. A second series began on 14 September 2006 in the UK and featured appearances by [[Daniel Radcliffe]], [[Diana Rigg|Dame Diana Rigg]], [[Orlando Bloom]], [[Ian McKellen|Sir Ian McKellen]], [[Chris Martin]], [[Keith Chegwin]], [[Robert Lindsay (actor)|Robert Lindsay]], [[Warwick Davis]], [[Ronnie Corbett]], [[Stephen Fry]], [[Richard Briers]], [[Patricia Potter]], [[Sophia Myles]], [[Moira Stuart]], [[David Bowie]], [[Kate Winslet]], [[Robert De Niro]] and [[Jonathan Ross]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/tvandradioblog/2007/dec/28/lastnightstvextras |title=Extras attacked celebrity - with a little help from George Michael, David Tennant et al|work=The Guardian|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:JonathanRossRickyGervais.jpg|thumb|Gervais (right) with [[Jonathan Ross]] at [[Live 8]] in July 2005]]
A Christmas special of ''Extras'' aired on 27 December 2007 in the UK and on 16 December 2007 in the US, featuring guest appearances by [[George Michael]], [[Clive Owen]], [[Gordon Ramsay]], Jonathan Ross and [[David Tennant]].

Gervais was influenced by ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'', in making ''Extras'', particularly in the format of celebrities making fools of themselves or subverting their public personas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/pictures/the-curb-effect-how-larry-david-changed-comedy-forever-20110720/ricky-gervais-0166936|title=Tricky Gervais The Curb Effect How Larry David Changed Comedy Forever |work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Gervais won the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series]] for his portrayal of Andy Millman in the second series of ''Extras''. As Gervais was not present at the awards ceremony, the trophy was accepted on his behalf by [[Steve Carell]], the actor who starred as regional manager [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]] – the counterpart to Gervais' David Brent – on [[The Office (U.S. TV series)|the American adaptation of ''The Office'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/lat-accep-carel_johsi3nc20090817152500-photo.html |title=Jon Stewart, Stephen Colbert and Steve Carell accept Ricky Gervais' Emmy |publisher=LA Times |date=5 November 2017 |accessdate=10 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Guardian]]''{{'}}s Chris Tryhorn explained the "few gripes" he had with ''Extras'', "particularly in the second series". "You can forgive Gervais a certain arrogance after the success of ''The Office'', but..." He remarks on the confused tone of the series, taking in the clash between the broad comedy of characters Barry ([[Shaun Williamson]]) and Darren ([[Stephen Merchant]]), and the apparent parody of this style with ''When The Whistle Blows'', and "given their total indulgence of Gervais, the BBC is portrayed as interfering, its comedy department run by a rather crudely [[stereotype]]d gay couple".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/organgrinder/2006/sep/22/extrasworkneededricky|title=Extras work needed, Ricky?|first=Chris |last=Tryhorn|work=The Guardian|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is described by Gervais as being about "the life of a showbiz [[Dwarfism|dwarf]]" and as "a cross between ''Extras'' and ''The Office''". The show stars actor Davis playing a fictionalized version of himself, as well as Gervais and Merchant.&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/aug/24/ricky-gervais-lifes-too-short|title=Ricky Gervais plans Life's Too Short film|date=24 August 2010|accessdate=15 September 2010|work=[[The Guardian]]|first=Ben|last=Child|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Premium cable channel [[HBO]], who co-produced the series with the BBC, had the US rights and began airing the series on 19 February 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/television/Ricky-Gervais-Steven-Merchant-Warwick-Davis-Tease-Life-Too-Short-36112.html|title=Ricky Gervais, Steven Merchant, And Warwick Davis Tease Life's Too Short|publisher=Cinemablend.com|date=17 October 2011|accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/ustv/news/a326379/ricky-gervais-lifes-too-short-heads-for-hbo.html |title=Ricky Gervais 'Life's Too Short' heads for HBO – US TV News |publisher=Digital Spy |date=23 June 2011 |accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''An Idiot Abroad''====
{{Main|An Idiot Abroad}}
''[[An Idiot Abroad]]'' is a travel documentary produced by Gervais and Merchant where a reluctant Pilkington travels around the world, while his reactions to people and places is recorded. Occasionally, Gervais and Merchant call him to surprise him with a new place to visit or a task to do. Pilkington reports back to them and mostly complains about the situation he is in. Gervais said there is no planning, a camera crew follows his friend around recording many hours of film which Gervais edits down to about an hour each episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/11326209|title=Ricky Gervais says show with Karl Pilkington is real|publisher=BBC|accessdate =6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To date two series and a Christmas special have aired, series one involves Pilkington visiting the Seven Wonders of the World, in the second show he chooses to complete tasks from a bucket list provided by Gervais and in the special Warwick Davis joins Pilkington on a journey following Marco Polo's route from Italy to China.

====''Derek''====
{{Main|Derek (TV series)}}
In November 2011, Gervais filmed in London a 35-minute pilot episode for a potential [[comedy-drama]] series called ''[[Derek (TV series)|Derek]]'', which aired on [[Channel 4]] on 12 April 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Plumplard.com |date=August 2004 |url=http://rickygervais.com/thissideofthetruthe.php |title=Ricky Gervais...

British comedian [[Kerry Godliman]] plays Derek's best friend Hannah and David Earl plays Kev.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/programmes/derek/episode-guide/series-1/episode-1 |title=Derek |publisher=[[Channel 4]] |date=29 March 2012 |accessdate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gervais said that the series is about "kindness [being] more important than anything else". He added "It's about the forgotten – everyone's forgotten. It's all these arbitrary people who didn't know each other, and they're in there now because they're in the last years of their life. And it's about the people who help them, who themselves are losers and have their own problems. It's about a bunch of people with nothing, but making the most of it, and they're together." He chose to set the sitcom in a retirement home after he watched ''[[Secret Millionaire]]'' – "It was always these people with huge problems who were helping other people. I thought about having Derek help old people because no one cares about old people in this country... I think it's perfect for now."&lt;ref name=independentderek&gt;{{cite news|last=Gilbert|first=Gerard|title='Mock the disabled?

===Stand-up comedy===
Gervais began his stand-up career in the late 1990s; his first successful show took place at the [[Cafe Royal]], as part of the [[2001 Edinburgh Festival Fringe]]. Titled ''Rubbernecker'', the show also featured [[Jimmy Carr]], [[Robin Ince]] and [[Stephen Merchant]].

Gervais later toured the UK in 2003 with his stand-up show ''[[Animals (comedy)|Animals]]''. The ''[[Politics (comedy)|Politics]]'' tour followed a year later. Both of these shows were recorded for release on DVD and television broadcast. The third part of the themed live trilogy, ''[[Fame (comedy)|Fame]]'', took place in 2007. It started in [[Glasgow]] in January and ended in [[Sheffield]] in April. [[Blackpool]] reported selling out of tickets within 45 minutes of them going on sale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2006/12/13/4816/what_a_sell-out|title=What a sell-out, Huge demand for Gervais tour}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Newsnight Review]]'''s panel saw ''Animals'' during its [[UCL Bloomsbury|Bloomsbury]] run and covered it in January 2003. They were not favourable, with ''[[Private Eye]]'' editor [[Ian Hislop]] saying it was "cobbled together...banal...a bit flat".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/review/2654105.stm|title=BBC News, 13&amp;nbsp;January 2003 | date=13 January 2003 | accessdate=27 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this, Gervais closed each show by calling Hislop an "ugly little pug-faced cunt".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/showbiz/news/a179513/ten-things-you-never-knew-about-ricky-gervais.html|title=Ten Things You Never Knew About Ricky Gervais|publisher=Digital Spy|first=Alex |last=Fletcher|accessdate=24 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/newsnight/review/2654105.stm|title=Newsnight Review discussed Ricky Gervais one man show Animals at the Bloomsbury Theatre in London.|publisher=BBC|accessdate=24 January 2015|date=13 January 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Fame'' was the subject of some controversy in January 2007 when Gervais told a story, ostensibly about how people will do anything to become famous, referring to [[Ipswich serial murders|the murder of prostitutes in Ipswich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gervais apologetic over 'killing' joke|url=http://www.ipswichstar.co.uk/news/gervais_apologetic_over_killing_joke_1_112739|website=Ipswich Star|accessdate=14 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Gervais announced that his next stand up show will be called ''Humanity''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2013-01-17/ricky-gervais-returning-to-stand-up-comedy-i-think-it-will-be-my-angriest-yet|title=Ricky Gervais returning to stand-up comedy: "I think it will be my angriest yet"|work=[[Radio Times]]|accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2014, he said he was too busy to do his tour due to producing two films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2014-12-08/ricky-gervais-why-my-humanity-live-stand-up-tour-is-on-hold-for-now|title=Ricky Gervais Why My Humanity Live Stand Uo Tour is On Hold for Now|work=Radio Times|accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2016, Gervais was back doing stand up in London, starting with some low key warm-ups with cast members from ''[[Derek (TV series)|Derek]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2016-03-29/ricky-gervais-is-performing-stand-up-gigs-in-london-this-may|title=Ricky Gervais is performing stand up gigs in London this May|work=Radiotimes|accessdate=1 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said, "Finally, I'm going to do some stand-up. The first in about six years if you don't count hosting the [[Golden Globes]]."

He continued his ''Humanity'' show throughout 2017 and into 2018; appearing at [[SF Sketchfest]] as part of the tour, which devoted a night in honor of the comedian, alongside comedic legend and mentor [[Christopher Guest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ricky Gervais to appear at SF Sketchfest before taking on ‘Humanity’|url=http://www.sfchronicle.com/performance/article/Ricky-Gervais-to-appear-at-SF-Sketchfest-before-12473686.php|website=SF Chronicle|accessdate=2 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His next tour and [[Netflix]] special was announced in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2018/04/20/39738/ricky_gervais_announces_his_first_supernature_gigs|title=Ricky Gervais announces his first SuperNature gigs : News 2018 : Chortle : The UK Comedy Guide|first=Powder Blue Internet Business|last=Solutions|website=www.chortle.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Animation====
One of the first animations Gervais voiced was the character of Penguin in [[Robbie the Reindeer]]'s ''Legend of the Lost Tribe''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/episode/n2kph/robbie-the-reindeer-in-legend-of-the-lost-tribe|title=Robbie the Reindeer in Legend of the Lost Tribe|work=Radio Times|accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gervais guest-starred in an episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]'' entitled "[[Homer Simpson, This Is Your Wife]]". He is the only British comic to write and star in a ''Simpsons'' episode. The episode was the highest rated in Sky One's history; it revolved around the angle that Gervais was the episode's sole writer (and the first guest star on the show to also receive a writing credit for the episode of his appearance). Gervais clarified the extent of his input in a joint interview (with Christopher Guest) for ''[[Dazed &amp; Confused (magazine)|Dazed and Confused]]'' magazine (January 2006): "No, all I did was put down a load of observations on an email and they made it look like a ''Simpsons'' script. I'm going to get the credit, but I think everyone in the industry knows it was a joint effort". Asked in a separate interview about how his idea for the episode (in which Homer swaps Marge on a game show) came about, Gervais replied: "I've always been fascinated with reality game shows but I think it was my girlfriend's idea. We watch ''[[Big Brother (UK)|Celebrity Big Brother]]'' at the moment, we watch ''[[I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!|I'm a Celebrity, Get Me out of Here...]]'' we watch all those reality TV shows&amp;nbsp;– ''The Office'' came out of those docu-soaps".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukula.com/TorontoArticle.aspx?SectionID=3&amp;ObjectID=1665&amp;CityID=3|title= Interview at UKULA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gervais, a longstanding ''Simpsons'' fan, presented a segment to mark the show's 20th anniversary on [[BBC Two]]'s ''[[The Culture Show]]'' on 16 June 2007.

In 2012, Gervais made a guest appearance on ''[[Family Guy]]'' in the episode titled "[[Be Careful What You Fish For]]". In the episode, Gervais plays a dolphin named Billy Finn who gives [[Peter Griffin]] a [[Mercedes-Benz]] hood ornament, Peter half-heartedly promises a favor to him. Soon, Billy moves to Quahog but outstays his welcome at Peter's. Peter tries to reunite Billy with his ex-wife in hopes that he will return to the ocean. The episode also featured [[Lucy Davis]].

In season 8 episode 6 ''The Hero'' of the HBO series ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'', Gervais was a guest at Larry David's dinner table.

====Entertainment====
Gervais made a cameo appearance on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in a ''Digital Short'' during which he joked that ''The Office'' was adapted from a Japanese programme of the same name (with [[Steve Carell]] reprising his role as Michael Scott). The sketch re-creates scenes from the American and British pilot episode with Japanese elements (although in an exaggerated way). "It's funny", Gervais laughs at the end, "because it's racist".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/ustv/news/a437948/ricky-gervais-to-host-saturday-night-live.html|title=Ricky Gervais to host 'Saturday Night Live'?|date=13 November 2012|publisher=Digital Spy|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
