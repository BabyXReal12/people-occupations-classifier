====Departure from ''America's Got Talent''====
From 2009 to 2016, Cannon served as the host of ''[[America's Got Talent]]''. He announced he would not be back for 2017, citing creative differences between him and executives at NBC. The resignation came in the wake of news that the network considered firing Cannon after he made disparaging remarks about NBC in his [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] comedy special, ''Stand Up, Don't Shoot''. "I love art and entertainment too much to watch it be ruined by controlling corporations and big business," Cannon said in a statement, referencing cable giant [[Comcast]]'s ownership of NBC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nick Cannon Quits America's Got Talent After Threats of Firing over Race Joke|url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/nick-cannon-quits-americas-got-talent/|website=TV Guide|accessdate=13 February 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cannon, however, was technically under contract to host ''America's Got Talent'' and could have been potentially sued by NBC for breach of contract, though this was considered unlikely. NBC executives did not accept his resignation and had been stated to be keeping their fingers crossed that he would instead choose to return.&lt;ref name="globalgrind"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://globalgrind.com/4217181/americas-got-talent-execs-have-this-to-say-about-nick-cannons-departure/|title=America’s Got Talent Execs Have This To Say About Nick Cannon’s Departure|first=Kiyonna|last=Anthony|publisher=Globalgrind|date=February 15, 2017|accessdate=February 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 16, 2017, Cannon stated that he planned to stand his ground when it came to resigning from ''America's Got Talent''.&lt;ref name="standground"&gt;{{Cite news|title='Stand my ground': Nick Cannon resolves to 'stay firm' after quitting AGT and picks Ryan Seacrest as heir|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-4233410/Nick-Cannon-resolves-stay-firm-quitting-AGT.html|publisher=[[Daily Mail]]|date=February 16, 2017|accessdate=February 17, 2017|first=Paul|last=Chavez}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cannon's resignation was ultimately accepted as final without further incident.

In 2015, Cannon was named as "Chief Creative Officer" for the now-defunct [[RadioShack]].&lt;ref name=radioshack&gt;{{cite web|last1=Coz|first1=Jamieson|title=Nick Cannon is RadioShack's new 'chief creative officer,' for some reason|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/12/2/9836494/nick-cannon-radioshack-chief-creative-officer|website=The Verge|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the company this role involved "creating RadioShack-exclusive products and curating the in-store experience."&lt;ref name=radioshack/&gt; RadioShack chose him in hopes of catering to a younger crowd.&lt;ref name=radioshack/&gt;

==Personal life==
Cannon married singer [[Mariah Carey]] on April 30, 2008, at her private estate on [[Windermere Island]] in The Bahamas.&lt;ref name=mtvvid2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1586974/mariah-carey-nick-cannon-wedding-photo-released.jhtml|title=It's Official!

Cannon was hospitalized on January 4, 2012, for treatment of "mild kidney failure", and again on February 17 after a [[pulmonary embolism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/entertainment&amp;id=8490148&amp;rss=rss-kabc-article-8490148|title=Nick Cannon hospitalized for 'mild kidney failure'|date=January 4, 2012|network=[[KABC-TV]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 5 he announced that his kidney problems were due to [[lupus nephritis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=CNN|title=Lupus 'attacking my kidneys', Cannon says|url=http://thechart.blogs.cnn.com/2012/03/05/lupus-attacking-cannons-kidneys/?hpt=hp_t3|author= Madison Park|accessdate=March 5, 2012|date=March 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cannon enrolled at [[Howard University]] in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hiphopdx.com/news/id.40137/title.class-of-2020-nick-cannon-enrolls-at-howard-university |title=Nick Cannon enrolls at Howard University to study communications and planning |last=Eustice |first=Kyle |date=19 November 2016 |website=[[Hiphopdx]] |access-date=19 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Activism===
In 2011, Cannon filmed a public service announcement for [[Do Something]] encouraging teens to find a cause about which they are passionate and take action in their communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Do Good, Look Good|url=http://www.dosomething.org/macys|publisher=Do Something|accessdate=2014-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 2011, Cannon has served as the celebrity spokesperson for the [[National Association of Letter Carriers]]' annual national food drive, which is held throughout the United States on the second Saturday in May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Association of Letter Carriers|url=https://www.nalc.org|publisher=National Association of Letter Carriers|accessdate=2014-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2016, Cannon was widely reported as commenting on his [[Anti-abortion movements|opposition to abortion]], saying that abortion is modern-day [[eugenics]] and [[population control]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-3974472/Nick-Cannon-stands-statements-Planned-Parenthood-eugenics-lands-LAX.html|title=Nick Cannon says Planned Parenthood is 'population control'|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feud with Eminem==

[[Eminem]]'s 2009 album, ''[[Relapse (Eminem album)|Relapse]]'', contained a track titled "Bagpipes from Baghdad", poking fun at Cannon's wife, Mariah Carey. Cannon responded via his Twitter account, while Mariah released a song and video titled "[[Obsessed (Mariah Carey song)|Obsessed]]", with lyrics and visuals aimed at Eminem.

Eminem responded with a mixtape-style track called "[[The Warning (Eminem song)|The Warning]]" in which he addressed both Cannon and Mariah, and later commented that he was finished talking about the subject.

The feud was thought to have been over until in September 2010 when Cannon responded with the song "I'm a Slick Rick", in which he takes shots at Eminem in [[Slick Rick]]'s flow over the instrumental for [[Cali Swag District]]'s "[[Teach Me How to Dougie]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kuperstein |first=Slava |url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.12204/title.nick-cannon-releases-eminem-diss-track |title=Nick Cannon Releases Eminem Diss Track|publisher=HipHopDX |date=September 13, 2010 |accessdate=October 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by a campaign via Facebook, Twitter, and his radio show proposing a boxing ring fight between Eminem and Cannon for charity.

In late September 2011, over a year after "I'm a Slick Rick" was released, Cannon took another lyrical jab at Eminem by releasing a song called "I Remember".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kovideo.net/nick-cannon-releases-new-song-called-i-remember-news-nick-cannon-4166.html |title=Nick Cannon Releases New Song Called "I Remember" |publisher=Kovideo.net |date=September 27, 2011 |accessdate=November 25, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120903143619/http://www.kovideo.net/nick-cannon-releases-new-song-called-i-remember-news-nick-cannon-4166.html |archivedate=September 3, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=OFFICIALjoefosho17 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLGdtRUO2dc |title=Nick Cannon – I Remember |publisher=YouTube |date=September 27, 2011 |accessdate=November 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 3, 2011, Cannon released another song called "Warning (Remix)" featuring [[Uncle Murda]], aimed at Eminem, radio host Charlamagne Tha God, and the feud between R&amp;B singer [[Ray J]] and rapper [[Fabolous]]. The song features Cannon firing lyrical shots at Eminem and an audio clip of Eminem with [[Tim Westwood]] back in 2009 where Eminem saying: "I had no idea Nick Cannon was going to start 'wiling out' on me," referring to Cannon's then canceled ''[[Wild 'n Out]]'' television show. Cannon retorted to the clip by saying: "You said it Marshall, that's all you had to do!" and that Slim Shady is "forgiven."&lt;ref name="youtube1"&gt;{{cite web|author=nickcannon |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNaGG2zGSsE&amp;feature=player_embedded |title=NickCannon.com Exclusive: "Warning" Remix |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=November 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hiphopwired1"&gt;{{cite web|author=&amp;raquo; by Danielle Canada October 4, 2011, 8:07am |url=http://hiphopwired.com/2011/10/04/nick-cannon-disses-charlamagne-tha-god-on-new-track-warning-audio/ |title=Nick Cannon Disses Charlamagne Tha God On New Track "Warning " (Audio) |publisher=Hiphopwired.com |date=October 4, 2011 |accessdate=November 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Langhorne |first=Cyrus |url=http://www.sohh.com/2011/10/nick_cannon_fires_warning_shot_charlamag.html |title=Nick Cannon Fires "Warning" Shot, Charlamagne Tha God Responds (Audio) |publisher=Sohh.Com |date=October 4, 2011 |accessdate=November 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="taletela1"&gt;{{cite web |author=Popular right now: |url=http://www.taletela.com/news/9978/nick-cannon-fires-back-at-eminem-&amp;-disses-ray-jfabolous-beef-in-uncle-murda-remix-track |title=Nick Cannon Fires Back At Eminem &amp; Disses Ray J/Fabolous Beef In Uncle Murda Remix Track |publisher=TaleTela |date=October 4, 2011 |accessdate=November 25, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130204000200/http://www.taletela.com/news/9978/nick-cannon-fires-back-at-eminem-&amp;-disses-ray-jfabolous-beef-in-uncle-murda-remix-track |archivedate=February 4, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 2, 2016, Cannon had an interview with [[Tim Westwood]]. Westwood said, "Last time I saw you, you were getting ready to battle Eminem." Cannon responded, "I'm still ready! I'm trying to find him. Where is he? ... We gonna be out in the States for the [[BET Awards]]. I'm holding a $100,000 battle — whoever wants it — but it has to be someone who can put up 100 grand ... I done reached out to [[Tyga]], he didn't want it. I went to all [[Slaughterhouse (hip hop group)|Slaughterhouse]]. I did it like [[Mortal Kombat]], I said I'll take all of them out to get to the boss." Throughout the interview, Westwood goads Cannon along, saying, "Nick, you're the best fam. I don't think you'd win against Eminem, but you are the best in many other ways." Cannon plays along with everything and says, "At least tell him to show up to the match. I can't win by default."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIdW7Faipf4|title=Nick Cannon on battling Eminem for 100k - Westwood|first=|last=TimWestwoodTV|date=June 2, 2016|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hiphopdx.com/news/id.39077/title.nick-cannon-calls-out-eminem-for-100k-battle|title=Nick Cannon Calls Out Eminem For $100K Battle|first=HipHopDX -|last=http://hiphopdx.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 16, 2016, Cannon pours out his heart in a track titled "Divorce Papers." He recently refused to sign divorce papers with his ex-wife Mariah Carey. He also mentioned his father passing away. Cannon used some lines in the track as a response for the hate comments he had from Eminem's fans, who are known as "Stans". He mentions Eminem in a few lines. He said that he can relate to the drug life Eminem had. "Em, right now I could really relate to him. Drug habits, all the pain that he was in." The last thing he mentioned in the track, he talks about himself finally signing the divorce papers. "It's been over two years and I'm the one that's been waitin'. It's fucked up that the time that you spend with your own kids is called 'visitation'? Man, fuck it, let's sign these papers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hiphopdx.com/singles/id.34064/title.nick-cannon-pours-his-heart-on-divorce-papers|title=Nick Cannon Pours His Heart On "Divorce Papers"|first=HipHopDX -|last=http://hiphopdx.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
