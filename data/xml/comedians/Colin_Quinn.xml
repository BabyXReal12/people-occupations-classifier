'''Colin Edward Quinn''' (born June 6, 1959)&lt;ref name=filmref /&gt; is an [[United States|American]] stand-up comedian, actor, and writer. On television, he is best known for his work on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', where he anchored [[Weekend Update]], on [[MTV]]'s 1980s game show ''[[Remote Control (game show)|Remote Control]]'', where he served as the announcer/sidekick, and as host of [[Comedy Central]]'s late-night panel show ''[[Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn]]''. Notable film work includes his role as Dooey in ''[[A Night at the Roxbury]]'', Dickey Bailey in the ''[[Grown Ups (film)|Grown Ups]]'' films and playing [[Amy Schumer]]'s father in the film ''[[Trainwreck (film)|Trainwreck]]''. Comedians such as [[Jerry Seinfeld]] and [[Dave Attell]] cite him as the quintessential New York comedian.

Quinn has also become known for his comedic [[one-man show]]s that offer his unique takes on history and growing up in [[New York City]]. As of 2015, he has written and starred in five shows: ''Irish Wake'', ''My Two Cents'', ''Long Story Short'', ''Unconstitutional'', and ''The New York Story'', two of which he collaborated on with Seinfeld as director. ''Long Story Short'' was filmed as an [[HBO]] special that aired on April 9, 2011 and ''Unconstitutional'' and ''The New York Story'' were released as [[Netflix]] specials.

==Early life==
Quinn was born and raised in the [[Park Slope, Brooklyn|Park Slope]] neighborhood of [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City|New York]], the son of teachers.&lt;ref name="filmref"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.filmreference.com/film/65/Colin-Quinn.html | title=Colin Quinn Biography (1959-)| publisher=FilmReference.com | accessdate= June 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.askmen.com/celebs/interview_60/99b_colin_quinn_interview.html | title= Colin Quinn...Irish Comic Standing| publisher= (interview) AskMen.com| date= n.d.|page=2 | accessdate= June 11, 2015| quote=I grew up in Brooklyn, mixed area...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--He graduated from [[John Dewey High School]].--&gt; He is of [[Irish people|Irish]] descent. He attended the [[State University of New York at Stony Brook]], in [[Stony Brook, New York|Stony Brook]], [[Long Island]], but did not graduate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =http://www.danspapers.com/2011/06/colin-quinn-talks-with-dans/ | title= Colin Quinn Talks With Dan’s! | date=June 2, 2011 | first= David| last= Rattiner| work= [[Dan's Papers]] | publisher= Manhattan Media LLC | location = [[Southampton, New York]] | quote =  In college I stayed on Long Island and went to Stony Brook University. ...

==Career==

===Early career===
Quinn began performing stand-up comedy in 1984, and first achieved fame in 1987 as the sidekick announcer of the [[MTV]] game show ''[[Remote Control (game show)|Remote Control]]'', which lasted five seasons.  In 1989, he hosted the [[A&amp;E Network|A&amp;E]] stand-up showcase ''[[Caroline's Comedy Hour]]'', and wrote and acted in the comedic short/music video "Going Back to Brooklyn" (a parody of [[LL Cool J]]'s "[[Going Back to Cali (LL Cool J song)|Going Back to Cali]]") with [[Ben Stiller]]. He wrote for ''[[In Living Color]]'', and co-wrote and produced the movie ''[[Celtic Pride]]'', which starred [[Damon Wayans]] and [[Dan Aykroyd]].

===''Saturday Night Live''===
Quinn was hired as a writer and featured player on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (''SNL'') in [[Saturday Night Live (season 21)|1996]] and became a full cast member during the [[Saturday Night Live (season 23)|1997–1998 season]]. He established himself on the show with recurring characters and segments such as "Lenny the Lion", "Joe Blow", "Colin Quinn Explains ''The New York Times''", and "[[Weekend Update (sketch)|Weekend Update]]".&lt;ref name="top-100-2011" /&gt;

Quinn began hosting "Weekend Update" in January 1998 after [[Norm Macdonald]] was fired, and anchored the segment until his departure from ''SNL'' in 2000. He commented on a number of highly publicized [[media circus]]es, including the [[Lewinsky scandal|Clinton–Lewinsky scandal]] and the [[United States v. Microsoft|Microsoft anti-trust trial]].{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

During his tenure on ''SNL'', Quinn turned down an offer for the role of Scott Evil in fellow cast member [[Mike Myers (actor)|Mike Myers]]'s film ''[[Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery]]''. Quinn has called the role,  which was ultimately played by [[Seth Green]], the only project he has regretted turning down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Colin Quinn |url=http://www.avclub.com/article/colin-quinn-13816 |work=The Onion A.V. Club |first=Nathan |last=Rabin |date=June 18, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television and film work and stand-up===
After leaving ''SNL'', Quinn hosted the short-lived ''The Colin Quinn Show'' on [[NBC]] in the spring of 2002. The show combined sketch comedy and stand-up in a live-to-tape format. Despite mostly positive reviews from critics, it was cancelled after three episodes.

Quinn had greater success with his subsequent show, ''[[Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn]]'', which ran on weekdays on [[Comedy Central]] from 2002 to 2004. The show featured a panel of four comedians, with Quinn as host, discussing the social and political issues of the day. The show ran for over 200 episodes.

His stand-up was also used in the animated series ''[[Shorties Watchin' Shorties]]''.

[[File:USMC-13540.jpg|thumb|right|Quinn performing during a [[USO]] tour in 2005]]
In 2005, Quinn participated in a [[United Service Organizations|USO]] tour of American military bases around the world, performing stand-up to entertain the troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Garamone | first=Jim | date=August 25, 2005 | title=Around the World in 10 Days, Chairman-Style | url=http://archive.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=16810 | publisher=[[United States Department of Defense]] | access-date=July 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the "unofficial co-host" on the [[Nick DiPaolo]] show on the now-defunct 92.3 [[Free FM]] in New York City, airing Monday–Friday from noon to three. Quinn and DiPaolo were originally slated to host the show together on [[WJFK-FM]], but the station decided not to pick up the show.  Quinn was also a regular guest on ''[[The Opie &amp; Anthony Show]]'' until its run ended in 2014.

Quinn played Dickie Bailey, the childhood rival to Lenny Feder ([[Adam Sandler]]'s character) in both ''[[Grown Ups (film)|Grown Ups]]'' films. He also currently recurs as Hermie on the [[HBO]] series ''[[Girls (TV series)|Girls]]''.

Quinn wrote and starred in the [[L/Studio]] [[web series]] ''Cop Show'', which premiered in February 2015. The series stars Quinn as a satirical, pompous version of himself, starring in a New York City-based crime drama. The show's guest stars have included [[Jerry Seinfield]], [[Dave Attell]], [[Chris Rock]], [[Steve Buscemi]], [[Jim Gaffigan]], [[Michael Che]], [[Tom Papa]], [[Jim Norton (comedian)|Jim Norton]], [[Pat Cooper]], [[Irina Shayk]] and [[Amy Schumer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Holcomb-Holland|first1=Lori|title=Colin Quinn’s Streaming ‘Cop Show’ to Satirize Police Dramas|url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/03/colin-quinns-streaming-cop-show-to-satirize-police-dramas/?action=click&amp;contentCollection=Television&amp;region=Footer&amp;module=MoreInSection&amp;pgtype=article|accessdate=3 February 2015|agency=New York Times|publisher=Arts Beat|date=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quinn had a supporting role in Amy Schumer's film debut, ''[[Trainwreck (film)|Trainwreck]]'', as her character's father. He was critically praised for his performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Colin Quinn is legit good in Trainwreck |url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/07/23/colin-quinn-trainwreck |first=Christopher |last=Rosen |date=July 23, 2015 |publisher=Entertainment Weekly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===One-man shows===
Quinn made his [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] debut in 1998 in a one-man show, ''Colin Quinn: An Irish Wake'', co-written with Lou DiMaggio. The show reflected Quinn's upbringing within the Irish-American community of Brooklyn; it was set at a [[wake (ceremony)|wake]] in 1976, with Quinn portraying family members and acquaintances who show up for the event.

In 2009, Quinn premiered his second one-man show ''My Two Cents'', which covers the economic crumbling of the American empire.&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/iamcolinquinn/status/1713463866]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Quinn premiered his third one-man show ''Colin Quinn Long Story Short'' on Broadway, directed by Jerry Seinfeld. The show covered world history from prehistoric times to the present, offering satirical takes on the rise and fall of various world empires. Quinn recorded a special performance of the show that aired on [[HBO]] on April 9, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.broadwayworld.com/article/Colin_Quinn_Stars_In_Colin_Quinn_Long_Story_Short_At_Bleecker_Street_Theater_Thru_815_20100702 Broadway World]&lt;/ref&gt; A Brazilian version of the show featuring comedian [[Bruno Motta]] has the title ''1 Milhao de Anos em 1 Hora'' ("1 Million Years in 1 Hour").&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ummilhaodeanos.com.br&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Quinn premiered another one-man show on historical themes, ''Unconstitutional'', which covers the [[United States Constitution]], its creation, and its impact on the American psyche.&lt;ref name="framers reframed"&gt;{{cite web |title=Framers Reframed |url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/06/03/big-weather |work=The New Yorker |first=Rivka |last=Galchen |date=June 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quinn starred in his fifth one-man show, ''The New York Story'', in July and August 2015 at the Cherry Lane Theatre.  The show was based upon the experiences chronicled in his book, ''The Coloring Book: A Comedian Solves Race Relations in America''. It delves into his growing up in the ethnically diverse Park Slope neighborhood of Brooklyn and how it has changed over the years into its current state.&lt;ref&gt;https://thenew-yorkstory.squarespace.com/&lt;/ref&gt; Seinfeld, who directed ''Long Story Short'', returned as director.

===Social media===
Quinn has gained attention for his account on the social network [[Twitter]], where he usually posts deliberately vacuous statements, often in the form of either inspirational statements or boasts about his celebrity status, that are intended to provoke his readers.&lt;ref name="framers reframed" /&gt;

==Personal life==
In conversation with [[Judd Apatow]] in 2015 for the [[David Lynch Foundation]] Trainwreck tour,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Trainwreck Comedy Tour|url=http://www.davidlynchfoundation.org/emailing/2015_05_trainwreck.html|website=David Lynch Foundation|accessdate=25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quinn said he had been practicing [[Transcendental Meditation technique|Transcendental Meditation]] for five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tour Talk with Judd Apatow and Colin Quinn|url=http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/a0c4945e13/trainwreck-2?_cc=__d___&amp;_ccid=94d9927f-c1e8-4f2c-9feb-1db26e3c6ed2|website=Funny or Die|accessdate=25 January 2017|date=18 June 2015|quote=I do TM every day, twice a day, five years. [2' 5"]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 14, 2018, Quinn suffered a heart attack in New York. On Twitter several days later, he said he was doing well but if he dropped dead "you would see a funeral like [[Al Capone]]!"&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mail.com/entertainment/celebrity/8292872-snl-alum-quinn-recovering-heart-attack-with-humor.html#.7518-stage-set4-3&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Awards and honors==
In 2004, Quinn was named No. 56 on [[Comedy Central]]'s list of the 100 greatest stand-up comedians of all-time.

He was named one of the Top 100 Irish Americans of the year in 2004 and 2011 by the magazine ''[[Irish America (magazine)|Irish America]]''.&lt;ref name="top-100-2011"&gt;[http://irishamerica.com/2011/12/colin-quinn/ Top 100 - 2011: Colin Quinn], ''Irish America''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishabroad.com/irishworld/irishamericamag/aprilmay04/features/ www.irishabroad.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040704063634/http://irishabroad.com/irishworld/irishamericamag/aprilmay04/features/ |date=July 4, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
