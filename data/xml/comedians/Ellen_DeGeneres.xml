==Early life and education==
DeGeneres was born and raised in [[Metairie, Louisiana]], to [[Betty DeGeneres|Elizabeth Jane]] ([[née]] Pfeffer), a speech therapist, and Elliott Everett DeGeneres, an insurance agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.com/tv/ellen-degeneres-father-elliot-dies-92/|title=Ellen DeGeneres' Father Elliot Dies at 92: 'There Was Not One Bone of Judgment in His Body'|date=11 January 2018|publisher=People|author=Stone, Natalie}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=filmref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/61/Ellen-DeGeneres.html|title=Ellen DeGeneres Biography (1958-|publisher= Filmreference.com|accessdate=December 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bookref1"&gt;{{cite book|last=DeGeneres|first=Betty|title=Love, Ellen: A Mother/Daughter Journey|publisher=HarperCollins Publishers|year=2000|pages=22, 27|isbn=0-688-17688-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has one brother, [[Vance DeGeneres|Vance]], a musician and producer.

DeGeneres started performing stand-up comedy at small clubs and coffee houses. By 1981, she was the [[emcee]] at Clyde's Comedy Club in New Orleans. DeGeneres cites [[Woody Allen]] and [[Steve Martin]] as her main influences at this time.&lt;ref name="comedycouch.com"&gt;{{cite interview |subject=Ellen DeGeneres |interviewer=Guy MacPherson |title=The Comedy Couch |url=http://www.comedycouch.com/interviews/edegeneres.htm |location=Vancouver, B.C. |date= April 26, 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1980s she began to tour nationally, and in 1984 she was named [[Showtime (TV channel)|Showtime]]'s funniest person in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.womenfitness.net/story_ellenDeGeneres.htm|title=Amazing story of Ellen DeGeneres|website=www.womenfitness.net|access-date=2017-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Netflix ===

In early 2017, it was announced DeGeneres&amp;nbsp;will appear in a brand new [[Stand-up comedy|stand up]] special for&amp;nbsp;[[Netflix]] after 15 years not performing stand-up comedy. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/ellen-degeneres-netflix-stand-up-special-1202442920/|title=Ellen DeGeneres Lands New Netflix Stand-Up Special|last=Otterson|first=Joe|date=2017-05-24|work=Variety|access-date=2018-01-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film career==

[[File:EllenDeGeneres1997Emmies.jpg|right|thumb|Ellen DeGeneres at the Emmy Awards, September 1997]]
Ellen's work in the late 1980s and early 1990s included the film ''[[Coneheads (film)|Coneheads]]''. DeGeneres starred in a series of films for a show named ''[[Ellen's Energy Adventure]]'', which is part of the [[Universe of Energy]] attraction and pavilion at [[Walt Disney World]]'s [[Epcot]]. The film also featured [[Bill Nye]], [[Alex Trebek]], [[Michael Richards]], and [[Jamie Lee Curtis]]. The show revolved around DeGeneres' falling asleep and finding herself in an energy-themed version of ''[[Jeopardy!]]'', playing against an old rival, portrayed by Curtis, and [[Albert Einstein]]. The next film had DeGeneres co-hosting an educational look at energy with Nye. The ride first opened on September 15, 1996, as ''Ellen's Energy Crisis'', but was quickly given the more positive-sounding name ''Ellen's Energy Adventure''.

==Television career==

DeGeneres' first regular TV role was in a short-lived Fox sitcom called ''[[Open House (1989 TV series)|Open House]]''. She played the role of Margo Van Meter, an office worker at the Juan Verde Real Estate company. The show co-starred [[Alison LaPlaca]] and [[Mary Page Keller]]. In 1992, producers [[Neal Marlens]] and [[Carol Black]] cast DeGeneres in their sitcom ''[[Laurie Hill (TV series)|Laurie Hill]]'', in the role of Nurse Nancy MacIntyre. The series was canceled after only four episodes, but Marlens and Black were so impressed with DeGeneres' performance that they soon cast her in their next ABC pilot, ''These Friends of Mine'', which they co-created with [[David S. Rosenthal]].

DeGeneres' comedy career became the basis of the successful sitcom ''[[Ellen (TV series)|Ellen]]'', named ''These Friends of Mine'' during its first season. The [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] show was popular in its first few seasons due in part to DeGeneres' style of [[observational comedy|observational humor]]; it was often referred to as a "female ''[[Seinfeld]]''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/07/lgbt-history-month-icon-ellen-degeneres_n_1940831.html |title=GLBT History Month – Ellen DeGeneres |accessdate=November 28, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010224041/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/07/lgbt-history-month-icon-ellen-degeneres_n_1940831.html |archivedate=October 10, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ellen'' reached its height of popularity in April 1997, when DeGeneres came out as a lesbian on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]''. Her character on the sitcom also [[coming out|came out]] of [[the closet]] to her [[therapist]], played by [[Oprah Winfrey]].&lt;ref name="something"&gt;{{cite news|author=Caryn James|title=A Message That's Diminished by the Buildup|work=The New York Times|date=April 13, 1997|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9901E5DC173CF930A25757C0A961958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all|accessdate=March 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coming-out episode, titled "[[The Puppy Episode]]", was one of the highest-rated episodes of the show. The series returned for a fifth season but experienced falling [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] due to ABC's cutting back on promoting the show.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} It was believed that [[The Walt Disney Company]], ABC's parent owner, had become uncomfortable with the subject matter depicted on the show now that DeGeneres' character was openly gay.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} In May 1998, ''Ellen'' was canceled. DeGeneres returned to stand-up comedy and later re-established herself as a successful talk show host.

DeGeneres returned to television in 2001 with a new [[CBS]] sitcom, ''[[The Ellen Show]]''. DeGeneres launched a daytime television talk show, ''[[The Ellen DeGeneres Show]],'' in September 2003. One of several celebrity-hosted talk shows surfacing at the beginning of that season, including those of [[Sharon Osbourne]] and [[Rita Rudner]], her show has consistently risen in the [[Nielsen ratings]] and received widespread critical praise. It was nominated for 11 [[Emmy Award|Daytime Emmy Awards]] in its first season, winning four, including Best Talk Show. The show has won 25 [[Emmy Awards]] for its first three seasons on the air. DeGeneres is known for her dancing and singing with the audience at the beginning of the show and during commercial breaks. She often gives away free prizes and trips to be in her show's studio audience with the help of her sponsors.

DeGeneres celebrated her thirty-year class reunion by flying her graduating class to California to be guests on her show in February 2006. She presented Atlanta High School with a surprise gift of a new electronic [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] marquee sign. In May 2006, DeGeneres made a surprise appearance at the [[Tulane University]] commencement in New Orleans. Following [[George H. W. Bush]] and [[Bill Clinton]] to the podium, she came out in a bathrobe and furry slippers. "They told me everyone would be wearing robes," she said. Ellen then went on to make another [[commencement speech]] at Tulane in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=//www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e8ToRVOtRo|title=Ellen's Commencement Speech at Tulane, 2009|publisher=Youtube.com|date=April 28, 2010|accessdate=December 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show broadcast for a week from Universal Studios Orlando in March 2007. Skits included DeGeneres going on the Hulk Roller Coaster Ride and the Jaws Boat Ride. In May 2007, DeGeneres was placed on [[bed rest]] due to a torn ligament in her back.  She continued hosting her show from a hospital bed, tended to by a nurse, explaining "the show must go on, as they say."  Guests sat in hospital beds as well. On May 1, 2009, DeGeneres celebrated her 1000th episode, featuring celebrity guests such as [[Oprah Winfrey]], [[Justin Timberlake]], and [[Paris Hilton]], among others. {{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

On September 9, 2009, it was confirmed that DeGeneres would replace [[Paula Abdul]] as a judge of the [[American Idol (season 9)|ninth season]] of ''[[American Idol]]''. Her role started after the contestant auditions, at the beginning of "Hollywood Week".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/television-idol-idUSSP36888420090910|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171019163353/https://www.reuters.com/article/television-idol-idUSSP36888420090910|dead-url=yes|archive-date=October 19, 2017|title=Ellen DeGeneres Joins American Idol as Fourth Judge|publisher=Americanidol.com|date=September 9, 2009|accessdate=December 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cheno"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvwatch.people.com/2009/08/27/american-idols-next-guest-judge-revealed|title=American Idol's Next Guest Judge Revealed|publisher=Tvwatch.people.com|date=August 27, 2009|accessdate=December 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is reported that DeGeneres also signed a contract to be a judge on the show for at least five seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2009/09/american-idol-ellen-degeneres-steps-in-as-new-judge-replacing-paula-abdul.html|title='American Idol': Ellen DeGeneres to replace Paula Abdul as judge|publisher=Latimesblogs.latimes.com|date=September 9, 2009|accessdate=December 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She made her ''American Idol'' debut on February 9, 2010. However, on July 29, 2010, DeGeneres and Fox executives announced that the comedian would be leaving ''American Idol'' after one season. In a statement, DeGeneres said that the series "didn't feel like the right fit for me".&lt;ref name="degeneresidol"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Ellen DeGeneres is out as 'American Idol' judge|work=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=July 30, 2010|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-ellen-degeneres-american-idol,0,28082.story|accessdate=July 30, 2010|first=Scott|last=Collins}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in the [[2017–18 United States network television schedule|2017-2018 television season]] DeGeneres began hosting the [[game show]] [[Ellen's Game of Games]] on [[NBC]] which is based, and expands on games played on her talk show. The series had a preview episode on December 18, 2017 with regular episodes beginning the following January.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pederson|first1=Erik|title=NBC Sets Premiere Dates For ‘Ellen’s Game Of Games’, ‘Better Late Than Never’ &amp; ‘The Wall’|url=http://deadline.com/2017/11/nbc-premiere-dates-ellens-game-of-games-better-late-than-never-the-wall-1202216043/|website=Deadline|accessdate=8 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Award shows==

DeGeneres received wide exposure on November 4, 2001, when she hosted the televised broadcast of the [[Emmy Award]]s. Presented after two cancellations due to network concerns that a lavish ceremony following the [[September 11 attacks]] would appear insensitive, the show required a more somber tone that would also allow viewers to temporarily forget the tragedy. DeGeneres received several standing ovations for her performance that evening, which included the line: "What would bug the [[Taliban]] more than seeing a gay woman in a suit surrounded by [[Jews]]?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/oscars-ellen-degeneres-hosting-history-598767|title=Oscars: Ellen DeGeneres' Hosting History|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=2018-07-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2005, DeGeneres hosted the [[57th Primetime Emmy Awards|2005 Primetime Emmy Awards]] ceremony held on September 18, 2005.

===Animal rights and veganism===
Ellen previously described herself as a vegan and "big animal lover".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Koerner |first= Allyson |title= Ellen DeGeneres Discusses Vegan Journey |journal= ecorazzi |date= 2012-04-27 |accessdate= 2017-01-30 |url= http://www.ecorazzi.com/2012/04/27/ellen-degeneres-discusses-vegan-journey/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Setoodeh"&gt;{{cite news |title=Ellen's Big Gay Wedding |first=Ramin |last=Setoodeh |work=Newsweek |date=September 6, 2008 |url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/157556}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Rossi, too, is a vegan.&lt;ref name="Setoodeh"/&gt; Ellen co-ordinated a vegan outreach website titled 'Going Vegan with Ellen'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ellentv.com/categories/going-vegan-with-ellen/ |title=Going Vegan with Ellen}}&lt;/ref&gt; She intended to open a vegan tapas bar, Bokado, in Los Angeles, but plans fell through.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shepherd |first=Sea |url=http://www.ecorazzi.com/2012/07/05/ellen-degeneres-vegan-restaurant-not-coming-to-studio-city/ |title=Ellen DeGeneres' Vegan Restaurant Not Coming to Studio City |publisher=Ecorazzi |date=July 5, 2012 |accessdate=January 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site for ''The Ellen DeGeneres Show'' contains a section called "Going Vegan With Ellen", in which she promotes "Meatless Mondays" and features vegan recipes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Going Vegan with Ellen|url=http://www.ellentv.com/categories/going-vegan-with-ellen/|publisher=The Ellen DeGeneres Show}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has several times invited [[Humane Society of the United States]] CEO [[Wayne Pacelle]] to speak on her show about the organization's efforts in animal protection legislation. In 2009, [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|PETA]] named her their "Woman of the Year."&lt;ref&gt;Natalie Finn, " [http://www.eonline.com/news/160025/peta-s-top-dogs-ellen-degeneres-and-tim-gunn PETA's Top Dogs: Ellen DeGeneres and Tim Gunn]," EOnline, 30 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2013, she donated $25,000 to stop [[Ag-Gag]] anti-whistleblower legislation in Tennessee, which would prohibit undercover investigators from recording footage of animal abuse on farms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ellen Speaks Out on Ag-Gag Bills|url=http://hsus.typepad.com/wayne/2013/04/ellen-speaks-out-on-ag-gag-bills.html|publisher=HSUS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DeGeneres served as campaign ambassador to [[Farm Sanctuary]]'s Adopt-A-Turkey Project in 2010, asking people to start "a new tradition by adopting a turkey instead of eating one" at Thanksgiving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=White House to pardon two turkeys, helping them find better lives this Thanksgiving |work=USA Today |date=November 18, 2010 |url=http://yourlife.usatoday.com/mind-soul/doing-good/kindness/post/2010/11/turkeys-find-better-lives-this-thanksgiving-/131607/1 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111111191315/http://yourlife.usatoday.com/mind-soul/doing-good/kindness/post/2010/11/turkeys-find-better-lives-this-thanksgiving-/131607/1 |archivedate=November 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Humanitarianism===
In November 2011, Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] named her a [[special envoy]] for Global [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] Awareness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/09/us-ellendegeneres-idUSTRE7A85O520111109 |agency=Reuters |title=Ellen DeGeneres named global envoy for AIDS awareness |date=November 9, 2011 |first=Chris |last=Michaud}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 3, 2011, DeGeneres opened the show at the [[David Lynch Foundation]]'s 3rd annual "Change Begins Within" gala at the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]] to raise funds to bring [[Transcendental Meditation]] to at-risk populations suffering from epidemic levels of chronic [[stress (psychological)|stress]] and [[PTSD|stress-related disorders]]. She says: "TM is the only time I have that stillness… it gives me this peaceful feeling, and I love it so much. I can’t say enough good things about it. All the benefits that you can achieve from sitting still and going within—it really is a beautiful experience. [[David Lynch]] is such a wonderful man to start this foundation to help people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.davidlynchfoundation.org/featured-past-events.html|title=Featured Past Events – David Lynch Foundation|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bienfaits-meditation.com/en/david_lynch_foundation/support/ellen_degeneres|title=Ellen DeGeneres on Transcendental Meditation (Video transcription)|author=Codeway|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2017, it was announced that President [[Donald Trump]] would begin allowing the importation of elephant trophies from Africa. DeGeneres, an animal activist, created a hashtag campaign in partnership with her brand, ED Ellen DeGeneres, to donate to the [[David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust]]. DeGeneres also created a t-shirt with her brand whose proceeds also go to the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Herreria|first1=Carla|title=Ellen DeGeneres Is Fighting Trump's Elephant Trophy Policy With Kindness|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ellen-degeneres-trump-elephant-policy-be-kind_us_5a0e3601e4b045cf437082d2|website=Huffington Post|date=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2018, for Ellen's 60th birthday, Ellen's wife, [[Portia de Rossi]], gifted Ellen a permanent gorilla home in Rwanda built in her namesake for the [[Digit Fund]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PORTIA DE ROSSI SURPRISES WIFE ELLEN DEGENERES WITH AMAZING BIRTHDAY GIFT TO DIAN FOSSEY GORILLA FUND {{!}} Dian Fossey|url=https://gorillafund.org/portia-de-rossi-surprises-wife-ellen-degeneres-amazing-birthday-gift-dian-fossey-gorilla-fund/|website=Dian Fossey|date=1 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This gift was part of a new arm of the [[Digit Fund]] now called the "Ellen DeGeneres Wildlife Fund."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Portia Surprises Ellen with the Gift of a Lifetime: The Ellen DeGeneres Wildlife Fund!|url=https://www.ellentube.com/article/portia-surprises-ellen-with-the-gift-of-a-lifetime-the-ellen-degeneres-wildlife-fund.html|website=ellentube.com|language=en|date=2 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
