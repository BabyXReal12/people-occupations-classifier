==Career==
===Acting career===

During the 1980s, Mull played a supporting role in the film ''[[Mr. Mom]]'', and starred in a series of commercials for [[Michelob]] and [[Pizza Hut]], and in a series of television and [[radio]] commercials for [[Red Roof Inn]].

Notable live gigs included opening for [[Randy Newman]] and [[Sandy Denny]] at [[Boston Symphony Hall]] in 1973;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.learningace.com/doc/5522258/4b3a3c254d6c5346578e77192425c261/n24 |title=The Tech, (May 11, 1973) |publisher=Learningace.com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frank Zappa]] at [[Austin, Texas|Austin]]'s [[Armadillo World Headquarters]] in 1973; Billy Joel in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania in 1974; and for [[Bruce Springsteen]] at the Shady Grove Music Fair in [[Gaithersburg, Maryland]], in October 1974.

He participated in the June 15, 1971 exhibit "Flush with the Walls" in the men's room of the Boston Museum of Art to protest the lack of contemporary and local art in the museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cook|first=Greg|title=Local Artists Commemorate -and re-stage -a legendary protest|url=http://thephoenix.com/boston/arts/122501-local-artists-commemorate-and-re-stage-a-leg/|accessdate=9 July 2013|newspaper=The Phoenix|date=June 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work often combines [[photorealist]] painting, and the [[pop art]] and [[collage]] styles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artnet.com/artists/martin-mull/ Martin Mull], Artnet&lt;/ref&gt; He published a book of some of his paintings, titled ''Paintings Drawings and Words'', in 1995. One of his paintings was used on the cover for the 2008 [[Joyce Carol Oates]] novel ''[[My Sister, My Love (novel)|My Sister, My Love]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://furioushorses.com/2009/04/01/format-follies-pt-3/ Format Follies, Pt. 3], Christopher Currie, ''Furious Horses'' (blog), April 1, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Another painting, owned by [[Steve Martin]] titled ''After Dinner Drinks'' (2008), was used for the cover of ''[[Love Has Come for You]]'', an album by Steve Martin and [[Edie Brickell]].&lt;ref&gt;Neale, April (2013).

==Personal life==
Twice divorced, Mull is married to singer [[Wendy Haas]]. The two have a daughter, Maggie.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|id=0611898|section=bio|name=Martin Mull}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wojciechowski, Michele "Wojo" (2013). "[http://parade.condenast.com/168758/michelewojciechowski/foxs-dads-star-martin-mull-the-accidental-comedian/ FOX’s Dads Star Martin Mull: The Accidental Comedian]", ''Parade.CondeNast.com''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.tvguide.com/celebrities/martin-mull/bio/164903 Martin Mull Biography]", ''TvGuide.com''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lavin, Cheryl (1994). "[http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1994-09-04/features/9409040315_1_stanley-elkin-mull-kicked Martin Mull]", ''ChicagoTribune.com''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2010 interview on ''[[The Green Room with Paul Provenza]]'', Mull identifies himself as an [[agnostic]], saying "I certainly don't begrudge someone else their choice to follow whatever they do, it's just for me, it doesn't make a lot of sense. I think more harm has come to this planet through organized religion, probably, than any single situation that we've invented."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijCXUVj3ea0 | title=The Green Room with Paul Provenza | date=July 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
