== Early history ==
He was born '''George Francis Furnival''' in [[Liverpool]] to a working class family of Irish descent, to parents who were staunchly [[Roman Catholic]].&lt;ref name="The Guardian"/&gt; In conversation with the writer Ken Irwin in 1972,&lt;ref name="Irwin"&gt;{{Cite book

| publisher = Wolfe Publishing/TV Times
| isbn = 0-7234-0489-5
}}&lt;!--| accessdate = 6 October 2010--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; he remarked that "the rough and ready upbringing of Catholics in Liverpool brings out the humour in a family":

&lt;blockquote&gt;He's another comic who has known poverty. There were five children in the Roper family, three girls and two boys. Dad saw a lot of life – he was a window cleaner. 'Times were hard when I started at school, in the early war years,' says George. 'We never went without, but a jam butty was often a meal'.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He left school at the age of fifteen to join the [[Merchant Navy (United Kingdom)|Merchant Navy]] as a [[Cabin boy|galley boy]], then as steward.&lt;ref name="The Independent"/&gt; Later he served his [[national service]] in the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF), based in [[Eindhoven]] in the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref name="The Guardian"/&gt; It was during this period in the [[Netherlands]] that Roper began to sing with [[big band]]s at RAF concert parties.

He married Linda Groves in December 1968, and they had three children: Nicholas, Louise and [[Matt Roper|Matthew]].&lt;ref name="The Guardian"/&gt;

== Career ==
{{rquote|right|One of the most startling things about him was his resemblance to the great 1990s American comedian [[Bill Hicks]]. Like Hicks, Roper was predominantly concerned with the metaphysical futility of daily existence, only in his case, he maybe didn't realise it. |[[Tony Hannan]] in ''A History of Northern Comedy''&lt;ref name="A History of Northern Comedy"&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[Tony Hannan]]|title=On Behalf of the Committee – A History of Northern Comedy|publisher=[[Scratching Shed Publishing]]|year= 2009|isbn=978-0-9560075-6-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Working mainly in the [[North West England]] region, Roper began to sing semi-professionally in clubs and hotels during the early 1960s while supporting himself in various jobs, but soon found his real talent lay in performing comedy. He was encouraged by the [[music hall]] comedian [[Sandy Powell (comedian)|Sandy Powell]]. In his stage act the number of songs soon constricted and the gags expanded.

By 1965, with his portly figure, bejewelled fingers, deadpan style and a laid back microphone technique he began to draw sizeable audiences as a stand-up comic on the booming club and [[casino]] scene of [[Manchester]].&lt;ref name="Irwin"/&gt;
Regular at Manchester's Cabaret Club were the young reporter [[Michael Parkinson]] and [[Johnnie Hamp]], a producer from [[Granada Television]],&lt;ref name="Manchester Evening News"&gt;{{citation

Hamp was on the look-out for new acts for a new show, which was to become ''The Comedians'', a groundbreaking television series which ran intermittently between 1971 and 1993. Filmed in Manchester before a live audience, the programme consisted mainly of [[Northern England|Northern]] club comedians telling jokes. It was a major success at the time, garnering several industry awards and a [[BAFTA]] nomination,&lt;ref name="BAFTA"&gt;{{citation

This was acceptable on British TV during the 1970s but would not be acceptable today. Nevertheless, the show stands as a major social document of the era.&lt;ref name="CultureCast: Talk"&gt;{{citation

{{rquote|left|With his off-beat and sometimes surreal humour, Roper was an oddity in the series. His jokes were clean, inoffensive and were usually centred on "wellies" ([[wellington boot]]s). Everyone wore "wellies" in Roper's jokes. |The Times – 10 July 2003&lt;ref name="The Times"&gt;{{citation

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;blockquote&gt;The Comedians are totally and unashamedly outrageous in all that they do. This is why they have succeeded. Nothing, or no one, apparently, is sacred. And their jokes prove it. They joke about nothing and everything. Anyone and everyone. They joke about false teeth and parrots and homosexuals virtually in the same breath. They joke about Catholics and Protestants. They joke about [[Pakistani people|Pakistanis]], the Irish and the [[Jews]]. They joke about [[Enoch Powell]], [[Elizabeth II|the Queen]] and the Pope. When they go out in front of the cameras, it is invariably a no-holds-barred encounter with the British viewing public. You can either take it or switch over to another channel. Viewing figures have already conclusively proved that viewers, who are always the final judges in these things, stay tuned in.&lt;ref name="Irwin"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
In June 1971 he was one of a group of artists invited to perform in a televised Royal Gala Performance at the [[Liverpool Empire Theatre|Empire Theatre]], Liverpool in the presence of the Queen. The show featured only Liverpool-born performers and marked the opening of the [[Mersey Tunnel]].&lt;ref name="The Independent" /&gt; George Roper later made a number of notable television appearances including ''[[The Wheeltappers and Shunters Social Club]]'', ''[[Celebrity Squares]]'', ''At Long Last, This'' and ''[[The Grumbleweeds]]''. In 1980 he performed on the experimental comedy show ''Here Comes Channel 8'' (taking a look into the future of television, set in 1999) alongside [[Spike Milligan]], [[Rula Lenska]] and [[Michael Bentine]]. He was also a regular comic performer on the ITV gameshow ''[[3-2-1]]''. His work for the [[BBC]] in radio comedy included appearances on [[Frankie Howerd|''The Frankie Howerd Variety Show'']], [[Windsor Davies|''Windsor Davies Presents'']], [[Arthur Askey|''The Arthur Askey Show'']], the panel show ''Wit's End'' for [[BBC Radio 2]] and ''You've Got To Be Joking'' for [[BBC Radio 4]].&lt;ref name="BBC Radio Times online archives"&gt;{{citation

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
By the 1990s, comic tastes in the UK had changed quite radically, and many variety performers who filled the television schedules often found work difficult to come by. Roper was still in demand in clubs and in summer shows. He could also be seen as a contributor to documentaries including ''Heroes of Comedy''. He appeared regularly in the Spanish resort of [[Benidorm]], sharing the headline spot at the Talk of the Town with jazz musician [[Eric Delaney]]. He frequently performed for [[expatriate]]s in Hong Kong and the Middle East. He also toured Australia several times, where ''The Comedians'' made him a star.

== Death ==
George Roper died of cancer in 2003 at the age of 69. The previous year had seen him reunited with his co-stars from ''The Comedians'' for a long season at the [[Opera House Theatre, Blackpool|Opera House]], [[Blackpool]]. His final stage appearance was at the Liverpool Empire in May 2003.&lt;ref name="The Independent"/&gt; His funeral was attended by many figures from the world of comedy and sport, including [[Ricky Tomlinson]], [[Ken Dodd]], [[Frank Worthington]], [[Tommy Docherty]] and all of his contemporaries from ''The Comedians''.&lt;ref name="MEN"&gt;{{citation
