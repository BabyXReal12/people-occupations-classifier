'''Richard Lewis Hearne''', [[OBE]] (30 January 1908 – 23 August 1979&lt;ref&gt;GRO Register of Births: MAR 1908 4b 170 NORWICH – Richard Lewis Hearne&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;GRO Register of Deaths: SEP 1979 16 1269 MAIDSTONE – Richard Lewes Hearne, DoB = 30 January 1908&lt;/ref&gt;) was an [[England|English]] [[actor]], [[comedian]], [[Television producer|producer]] and [[writer]]. He is best remembered for his stage and television character '''Mr Pastry'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fedb77hZF18 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-11-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170407095330/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fedb77hZF18 |archivedate=7 April 2017 |df=dmy-all }} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Hearne was born in [[Norwich, Norfolk|Norwich]], Norfolk, in 1908, the son of Richard and Lily May Hearne. Richard senior came from a theatrical family – his mother had been on the stage and he himself was a performing [[Acrobatics|acrobat]]. Hearne worked on and off for the [[BBC]] for thirty years; he became the first performer to be known as a "television star" and also the first to have his own television series.{{fact|date=June 2015}} The series, with the theme tune "[[Pop Goes The Weasel]]", had episodes lasting 25 minutes in which Hearne assumed the character of "Mr Pastry" – an old man with a [[walrus moustache]], dressed in a black suit or raincoat and with a [[Trademark look|trademark]] [[bowler hat]]. Each week, the bumbling old man would have adventures, partly [[slapstick]], partly comic [[dance]], with two young friends. [[Jon Pertwee]] also starred in the show in a variety of roles.

The Mr Pastry character had originated in the 1936 stage show ''Big Boy'' in which Hearne had appeared with [[Fred Emney]]. A ''Mr Pastry'' film was subsequently made but portrayed the lead character as a pathetic figure coming out of prison and totally different from the TV series' bumbling comic.

His act first appeared on the US ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show|Ed Sullivan Show]]'' in 1954, and thereafter Hearne appeared on the show frequently. [[Buster Keaton]] was reportedly a fan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/film/j5mwp/the-time-of-his-life|title=The Time of His Life - Film from RadioTimes|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hearne was the subject of ''[[This Is Your Life (UK TV series)|This Is Your Life]]'' in 1959 when he was surprised by [[Eamonn Andrews]] at the BBC Television Theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bigredbook.info/richard_hearne.html|title=Richard Hearne|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963 Hearne became President of [[Lord's Taverners|the Lord's Taverners charity]] and he subsequently raised money for hundreds of [[hydrotherapy]] pools. In 1970 he was awarded an [[OBE]] for his charitable work.

He was interviewed for the starring role of the BBC series ''[[Doctor Who]]'' after the departure of [[Jon Pertwee]], but a disagreement over his interpretation of the role (he wanted to play the Doctor as Mr Pastry) led to no offer being made by the producer, [[Barry Letts]]. The role was subsequently offered to [[Tom Baker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/changingwho/10303.shtml?page=9|title=BBC - Archive - The Changing Face of Doctor Who - Nearly Who|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976 he appeared as Mr Pastry on the BBC's old time music hall show, ''[[The Good Old Days (UK TV series)|The Good Old Days]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b7fd7400c|title=The Good Old Days[18/03/76] (1976)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hearne died in [[Bearsted|Bearsted, Kent]], in 1979, aged 71, leaving a widow, Yvonne, and two children. He was buried in the churchyard in the village of [[Platt, Kent|St. Mary's Platt]], near [[Borough Green]] in [[Kent]]. He had lived at Platt Farm, a fifteenth-century property in Long Mill Lane in the village, from the 1940s, and ran a market garden there.&lt;ref name="Market garden"&gt;"The Television Annual for 1952", ed. by Kenneth Baily, Odhams Press, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;
