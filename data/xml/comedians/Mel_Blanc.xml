He was 81 years old. | first=Peter B. | last=Flint}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an American voice actor, comedian, singer, radio personality, and recording artist. After beginning his over 60-year career performing in radio, he became known for his work in [[Animated cartoon|animation]] as the voices of [[Bugs Bunny]], [[Daffy Duck]], [[Porky Pig]], [[Tweety|Tweety Bird]], [[Sylvester (Looney Tunes)|Sylvester the Cat]], [[Yosemite Sam]], [[Foghorn Leghorn]], [[Marvin the Martian]], [[Pepé Le Pew]], [[Speedy Gonzales]], [[Wile E.

Coyote, Road Runner]], the [[Tasmanian Devil (Looney Tunes)|Tasmanian Devil]] and many of the other characters from the ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' and ''[[Merrie Melodies]]'' [[Short film|theatrical cartoon]]s during the [[golden age of American animation]]. He voiced all of the major male [[Warner Bros.]] cartoon characters except for [[Elmer Fudd]], whose voice was provided by fellow radio personality [[Arthur Q. Bryan]], although Blanc later voiced Fudd as well after Bryan's death.&lt;ref name="BTVA"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/Mel-Blanc/ | title = Mel Blanc | accessdate = February 5, 2013 | publisher = Behind the Voice Actors}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He later voiced characters for [[Hanna-Barbera]]'s television cartoons, including [[Barney Rubble]] on ''[[The Flintstones]]'' and [[List of The Jetsons characters#Mr. Spacely|Mr. Spacely]] on ''[[The Jetsons]]''. Blanc was also the original voice of [[Woody Woodpecker]] for [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] and provided vocal effects for the ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'' cartoons directed by [[Chuck Jones]] for [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]], replacing [[William Hanna]]. During the [[Old-time radio|golden age of radio]], Blanc also frequently performed on the programs of famous comedians from the era, including [[Jack Benny]], [[Abbott and Costello]], [[Burns and Allen]] and [[Judy Canova]].&lt;ref name="BTVA"/&gt;

Having earned the nickname '''The Man of a Thousand Voices''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Harmetz | first=Aljean | authorlink=Aljean Harmetz | date=November 24, 1988 | title=Man of a Thousand Voices, Speaking Literally | publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/24/arts/man-of-a-thousand-voices-speaking-literally.html | access-date=July 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blanc is regarded as one of the most influential people in the [[voice acting|voice acting industry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ochcom.org/blanc|title=Mel Blanc's bio at Ochcom.org|publisher=|accessdate=October 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Blanc was born in [[San Francisco]], [[California]] to [[History of the Jews in Russia|Russian-Jewish]] parents Frederick and Eva Blank, the younger of two children. He grew up in the [[Western Addition]] neighborhood in San Francisco,&lt;ref&gt;Mintun, Peter (April 13, 1993) [http://www.amacord.com/fillmore/museum/mintun01.html "Look Back to the Upper Fillmore"] ''The Fillmore Museum''&lt;/ref&gt; and later in [[Portland, Oregon]], where he attended [[Lincoln High School (Portland, Oregon)|Lincoln High School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pdxhistory.com/html/mel_blanc.html |title=Mel Blanc |work=pdxhistory.com|accessdate=July 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Growing up, he had a fondness for voices and dialect which he began voicing at the age of 10. He claimed that he changed the spelling of his name when he was 16, from "Blank" to "Blanc", because a teacher told him that he would amount to nothing and be like his name, a "blank". Blanc joined the [[DeMolay International|Order of DeMolay]] as a young man, and was eventually inducted into its Hall of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://demolay.org/halloffame/bio.php?id=8|title=DeMolay Hall of Fame|author=DeMolay International|publisher=|accessdate=July 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating from high school in 1927, he split his time between leading an orchestra, becoming the youngest conductor in the country at the age of 19, and performing ''[[shtick]]'' in [[vaudeville]] shows around Washington, Oregon, and northern California.&lt;ref name="Blanc"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Blanc|first=Mel|first2=Philip|last2=Bashe|title=That's Not All, Folks!|location=Clayton South, VIC, Australia|publisher=Warner Books|year=1989|isbn=0-446-51244-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Radio work===
Blanc began his radio career at the age of 19 in 1927, when he made his acting debut on the [[KGW]] program ''The Hoot Owls'', where his ability to provide voices for multiple characters first attracted attention. He moved to Los Angeles in 1932, where he met Estelle Rosenbaum (1909–2003), whom he married a year later, before returning to Portland. He moved to [[KEX (AM)|KEX]] in 1933 to produce and co-host his ''Cobweb and Nuts'' show with his wife Estelle, which debuted on June 15. The program played Monday through Saturday from 11:00 pm to midnight, and by the time the show ended two years later, it appeared from 10:30 pm to 11:00 pm.

With his wife's encouragement, Blanc returned to Los Angeles and joined Warner Bros.–owned [[KFWB]] in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]] in 1935. He joined ''The Johnny Murray Show'', but the following year switched to [[CBS]] Radio and ''The [[Joe Penner]] Show''.

[[File:Jack Benny group photo.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The cast of ''[[The Jack Benny Program]]'', from left to right: [[Eddie Anderson (comedian)|Eddie Anderson]], [[Dennis Day]], [[Phil Harris]], [[Mary Livingstone]], [[Jack Benny]], [[Don Wilson (announcer)|Don Wilson]], and Mel Blanc]]

Blanc was a regular on the [[NBC]] Red Network show ''[[The Jack Benny Program]]'' in various roles, including voicing Benny's [[Maxwell automobile]] (in desperate need of a tune-up), violin teacher Professor LeBlanc, Polly the Parrot, Benny's pet polar bear Carmichael, the tormented department store clerk, and the train announcer. The first role came from a mishap when the recording of the automobile's sounds failed to play on cue, prompting Blanc to take the microphone and improvise the sounds himself. The audience reacted so positively that Benny decided to dispense with the recording altogether and have Blanc continue in that role. One of Blanc's most memorable characters from Benny's radio (and later TV) programs was "Sy, the Little Mexican", who spoke one word at a time. The famous "Sí ... Sy ... Sue ... sew" routine was so effective that no matter how many times it was performed, the laughter was always there, thanks to the comedic timing of Blanc and Benny.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|vIa7GYstYOQ|Video of Mel and Jack with one version of the Sy The Little Mexican routine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blanc continued to work with him on radio until the series ended in 1955 and followed the program into television from Benny's 1950 debut episode through guest spots on NBC specials in the 1970s. They last appeared together on a [[Johnny Carson]] ''[[Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson|Tonight Show]]'' in January 1974. A few months later, Blanc spoke highly of Benny on a [[Tom Snyder]] ''[[Tomorrow (TV series)|Tomorrow]]'' show special aired the night of the comedian's death.

By 1946, Blanc appeared on over 15 radio programs in supporting roles. His success on ''The Jack Benny Program'' led to his own radio show on the [[CBS Radio Network]], ''[[The Mel Blanc Show]]'', which ran from September 3, 1946, to June 24, 1947. Blanc played himself as the hapless owner of a fix-it shop, as well as his young cousin Zookie.

Blanc also appeared on such other national radio programs as ''The [[Abbott and Costello]] Show'', the Happy Postman on ''[[Burns and Allen]]'', and as August Moon on ''Point Sublime''. During World War II, he appeared as Private Sad Sack on various radio shows, including ''G.I. Journal''. Blanc recorded a song titled "Big Bear Lake".

===Animation voice work during the golden age of Hollywood===
[[File:Private Snafu - Spies.ogv|thumb|[[Private Snafu]]: ''[[Spies (1943 film)|Spies]]'', voiced by Blanc in 1943]]
In December 1936, Mel Blanc joined [[Warner Bros. Cartoons#1933–44: Leon Schlesinger Productions|Leon Schlesinger Productions]], which was producing theatrical cartoon shorts for Warner Bros. After sound man [[Treg Brown]] was put in charge of cartoon voices, and [[Carl Stalling]] became music director, Brown introduced Blanc to animation directors [[Tex Avery]], [[Bob Clampett]], [[Friz Freleng]], and [[Frank Tashlin]], who loved his voices. The first cartoon Blanc worked on was ''Picador Porky'' (1937) as the voice of a drunken bull.&lt;ref name="Blanc"/&gt; He soon after received his first starring role when he replaced [[Joe Dougherty]] as Porky Pig's voice in ''[[Porky's Duck Hunt]]'', which marked the debut of Daffy Duck, also voiced by Blanc.

Following this, Blanc became a very prominent vocal artist for Warner Bros., voicing a wide variety of the "Looney Tunes" characters. Bugs Bunny, whom Blanc made his debut as in ''[[A Wild Hare]]'' (1940),&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Barrier (historian)|Barrier, Michael]] (2003), [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0195167295 ''Hollywood Cartoons: American Animation in Its Golden Age''], Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-19-516729-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bugs Bunny 1990"&gt;Adamson, Joe (1990). ''Bugs Bunny: 50 Years and Only One Grey Hare''. New York: Henry Holt. {{ISBN|978-0-8050-1190-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; was known for eating carrots frequently (especially while saying his catchphrase "Eh, what's up, doc?"). To follow this sound with the animated voice, Blanc would bite into a carrot and then quickly spit into a [[spittoon]]. One oft-repeated story is that Blanc was allergic to carrots, which Blanc denied.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tim Lawson (writer)|Tim Lawson]], ''The Magic Behind The Voices: A Who's Who of Cartoon Voice Actors'' University Press of Mississippi, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2820/did-mel-blanc-hate-carrots "Did Mel Blanc hate carrots?"] A Straight Dope column by Science Advisory Board Member Rico November 4, 2008 (accessed November 20, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'', Blanc was hired to perform the voice of Gideon the Cat. However, Gideon eventually was decided to be a mute character (similar to Dopey from ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]''), so all of Blanc's recorded dialogue was deleted except for a solitary hiccup, which was heard three times in the finished film.&lt;ref&gt;''No Strings Attached: The Making of Pinocchio'', Pinocchio DVD, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; 

Blanc also originated the voice and laugh of [[Woody Woodpecker]] for the theatrical cartoons produced by [[Walter Lantz Productions|Walter Lantz]] for [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]], but stopped voicing the character after he was signed to an exclusive contract with Warner Bros. (His laugh was used in the cartoons until 1951, while his "Guess who!?" signature line was used until the end of the series in 1972).&lt;ref name="Blanc"/&gt; 

During World War II, Blanc served as the voice of the hapless [[Private Snafu]] in various war-themed animated shorts.&lt;ref name="looney.goldenagecartoons.com"&gt;{{cite web | work = Looney | url = http://looney.goldenagecartoons.com/miscelooneyous/snafu/ | title = Misce-Looney-Ous: Situation Normal All Fouled Up | publisher = Golden age cartoons | accessdate = February 20, 2012 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080512092007/http://looney.goldenagecartoons.com/miscelooneyous/snafu/ | archivedate = May 12, 2008 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout his career, Blanc, aware of his talents, protected the rights to his voice characterizations contractually and legally. He, and later his estate, never hesitated taking civil action when those rights were violated. Voice actors at the time rarely received screen credits, but Blanc was an exception; by 1944, his contract with Warner Bros. stipulated a credit reading "Voice characterization(s) by Mel Blanc." According to his autobiography, Blanc asked for and received this screen credit from studio boss [[Leon Schlesinger]] after he was denied a salary raise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://movies2.nytimes.com/gst/movies/filmography.html?p_id=6641|title=''New York Times'' filmography|publisher=|accessdate=November 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, Blanc's screen credit was limited only to cartoons where he voiced Bugs Bunny, with any other shorts he worked on being uncredited. In the middle of 1945, the contract was amended to include a screen credit for cartoons featuring Porky Pig and/or Daffy Duck as well, save for any shorts made before that amendment occurred (''[[Book Revue]]'' and ''[[Baby Bottleneck]]'' are examples, despite being released after the fact). But by the end of 1946, Blanc began receiving a screen credit in any subsequent Warner Bros. cartoon for which he provided voices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mel Blanc: From Anonymity To Offscreen Superstar (The advent of on-screen voice credits)|url=http://cartoonresearch.com/index.php/mel-blanc-from-anonymity-to-offscreen-superstar-the-advent-of-on-screen-voice-credits/|accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voice work for Hanna-Barbera and others===
In 1960, after the expiration of his exclusive contract with Warner Bros., Blanc continued working for WB, but also began providing voices for the TV cartoons produced by [[Hanna-Barbera]]; his most famous roles during this time were Barney Rubble of ''The Flintstones'' and [[List of The Jetsons characters#Mr. Spacely|Cosmo Spacely]] of ''The Jetsons''. His other voice roles for Hanna-Barbara included [[Dino (The Flintstones)|Dino the Dinosaur]], [[Secret Squirrel]], [[Speed Buggy]], and [[Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels|Captain Caveman]], as well as voices for ''[[Wally Gator]]'' and ''[[The Perils of Penelope Pitstop]].''

Blanc also worked with former "Looney Tunes" director Chuck Jones, who by this time was directing shorts with his own company Sib Tower 12 (later [[MGM Animation/Visual Arts]]); doing vocal effects for the ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'' series from 1963 to 1967. Blanc was the first voice of [[Toucan Sam]] in [[Froot Loops]] commercials.

Blanc reprised some of his Warner Bros. characters when the studio contracted him to make [[DePatie-Freleng Enterprises|new theatrical cartoons]] in the mid-to-late 1960s. For these, Blanc voiced Daffy Duck and Speedy Gonzales, the characters who received the most frequent use in these shorts (later, newly introduced characters such as Cool Cat and Merlin the Magic Mouse were voiced by [[Larry Storch]]). Blanc also continued to voice the "Looney Tunes" for the bridging sequences of ''[[The Bugs Bunny Show]]'', as well as in numerous animated advertisements and several compilation features, such as ''[[The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Movie]]'' (1979). He also voiced [[Granny (Looney Tunes)|Granny]] in ''Bugs Bunny’s High-Fructose Christmas Record'' (in place of [[June Foray]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cartoonresearch.com/index.php/bugs-bunnys-high-fructose-christmas-record/|title=Bugs Bunny’s High-Fructose Christmas Record {{!}}|website=cartoonresearch.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Car accident and aftermath===
On January 24, 1961, Blanc was involved in a near-fatal car accident. He was driving alone when his sports car [[head-on collision|collided head-on]] with a car driven by 18-year-old college student Arthur Rolston on [[Sunset Boulevard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last= |first= |date=January 25, 1961 |title=Mel Blanc, Man of Many Voices, Badly Injured |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7806040// |newspaper=The Terre Haute Tribune |location=Terre Haute, IN |agency=[[United Press International|UPI]] |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |accessdate=December 10, 2016 }} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rolston suffered minor injuries, but Blanc was rushed to the [[UCLA Medical Center]] with a triple skull fracture that left him in a coma for two weeks, along with sustaining fractures to both legs and the pelvis.&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;''That's Not All, Folks!'', 1988, by Mel Blanc and Philip Bashe. Warner Books, {{ISBN|0-446-39089-5}} (softcover), {{ISBN|0-446-51244-3}} (hardcover)&lt;/ref&gt; About two weeks after the accident, one of Blanc's neurologists tried a different approach.{{clarify|different to what?|date=June 2018}} Blanc was asked, "How are you feeling today, Bugs Bunny?" After a slight pause, Blanc answered, in a weak voice, "Eh... just fine, Doc. How are you?"&lt;ref name="Blanc"/&gt; The doctor then asked Tweety if he was there, too. "I tawt I taw a puddy tat," was the reply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiolab.org/story/248590-blanc/|title=What's Up, Doc?|date=November 6, 2012 |accessdate=October 27, 2014|website=RADIOLAB |last=Horowitz|first=Daniel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.openculture.com/2013/05/the_strange_day_when_bugs_bunny_saved_the_life_of_mel_blanc.html|title=The Strange Day When Bugs Bunny Saved the Life of Mel Blanc|date=May 6, 2013 |publisher=OpenCulture.com |last=Rix|first=Kate}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blanc returned home on March 17. Four days later, Blanc filed a US$500,000 lawsuit against the city of Los Angeles. His accident, one of 26 in the preceding two years at the intersection known as [[Dead Man's Curve#Other sharp curves|Dead Man's Curve]], resulted in the city funding the restructuring of curves at the location.

Years later, Blanc revealed that during his recovery, his son [[Noel Blanc|Noel]] "ghosted" several Warner Bros. cartoons' voice tracks for him. Warner Bros. had also asked [[Stan Freberg]] to provide the voice for Bugs Bunny, but Freberg declined, out of respect for Blanc. At the time of the accident, Blanc was also serving as the voice of Barney Rubble in ''The Flintstones''. His absence from the show was relatively brief; [[Daws Butler]] provided the voice of Barney for a few episodes, after which the show's producers set up recording equipment in Blanc's hospital room and later at his home to allow him to work from there. Some of the recordings were made while he was in full-body cast as he lay flat on his back with the other ''Flintstones'' co-stars gathered around him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1828&amp;dat=19880904&amp;id=EsMnAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=cL4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1214,1135635|title="Blanc laments lack of cartoon quality"|publisher=|accessdate=November 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also returned to ''The Jack Benny Program'' to film the program's 1961 Christmas show, moving around by crutches and a wheelchair.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last= |first= |date=November 24, 1961 |title=Mel Blanc Is Back at Work |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7812606// |newspaper=The Vernon Daily Record |location=Vernon, TX |agency=[[Associated Press|AP]] |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |accessdate=December 11, 2016 }} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mel Blanc 1976 2.jpg|thumb|left|upright=.9|Blanc in 1976]]

==Later career==
In the 1970s, Blanc gave a series of college lectures across the US and appeared in commercials for [[American Express]]. He  also collaborated on a special with the Boston-based Shriners Burns Institute called ''Ounce of Prevention,'' which became a 30-minute TV special.

Throughout the 1980s, Blanc performed his [[Looney Tunes]] characters for bridging sequences in various compilation films of [[Golden age of American animation|Golden-Age-era]] Warner Bros. cartoons, such as ''[[The Looney Looney Looney Bugs Bunny Movie]]'', ''[[Bugs Bunny's 3rd Movie: 1001 Rabbit Tales]]'', ''[[Daffy Duck's Fantastic Island]]'', and ''[[Daffy Duck's Quackbusters]]''. His final performance of his "Looney Tunes" roles was in ''Bugs Bunny's Wild World of Sports'' (1989). After spending most of two seasons voicing the diminutive robot Twiki in ''[[Buck Rogers in the 25th Century (TV series)|Buck Rogers in the 25th Century]],'' Blanc's last original character was [[Heathcliff (comic strip)|Heathcliff]], in the early 1980s.

In the 1983 live-action film ''[[Strange Brew]]'', Blanc voiced the father of [[Bob and Doug MacKenzie]], at the request of comedian [[Rick Moranis]].

In the 1988 live-action/animated movie ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]],'' Blanc reprised several of his classic "Looney Tunes" roles (Bugs, Daffy, Porky, Tweety, and Sylvester), but left Yosemite Sam to [[Joe Alaskey]] (who later became one of Blanc's regular replacements until his death in 2016).  As [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] produced the film, the company had to obtain permission from Warner Bros. and other studios in order to feature the non-Disney characters in the movie. The film was also one of very few Disney projects Blanc was involved in. Blanc died just a year after the film's release. His final recording session was for ''[[Jetsons: The Movie]]'' (1990).&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerry Beck|Beck, Jerry]]. ''The Animated Movie Guide'' (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear left}}

==Death==
[[File:Mel Blanc 4-15-05.JPG|thumb|Blanc's gravesite marker]]

Blanc began [[Tobacco smoking|smoking cigarettes]] when he was nine years old. He continued his pack-a-day habit until he was diagnosed with [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|emphysema]], which pushed him to quit at age 77.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mel Blanc: His Voice Is His Fortune|first=Aljean|last=Harmetz|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1988-11-27/features/8803090392_1_noel-blanc-mel-blanc-bugs-bunny|date=November 27, 1988|work=[[Sun-Sentinel]]|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]|accessdate=July 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 19, 1989, Blanc was checked into [[Cedars-Sinai Medical Center]] in Los Angeles by his family &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://onefoggy.tripod.com/blancobit.html|title= Mel Blanc - Obituary|publisher=|accessdate=November 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; when they noticed he had a bad cough while shooting a commercial; he was originally expected to recover. Blanc's health then took a turn for the worse and doctors found that he had advanced [[coronary artery disease]]. He died on July 10 at Cedars-Sinai, at the age of 81.&lt;ref name=NYTobit/&gt; He is interred in [[Hollywood Forever Cemetery]] in Hollywood. Blanc's will stated his desire to have the inscription on his gravestone read, "THAT'S ALL FOLKS", the phrase that was the hallmark of Blanc's character Porky Pig.

==Legacy==
Blanc is regarded as the most prolific voice actor in the history of the industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yImkNboc4tsC&amp;pg=PA217 |page=217 |title=Raised by the Stars: Interviews with 29 Children of Hollywood Actors |last=Thomas |first=Nick |publisher=McFarland |year=2011 |isbn=0786464038}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first voice actor to receive on-screen credit.&lt;ref name="Blanc"/&gt;

Blanc's death was considered a significant loss to the cartoon industry because of his skill, expressive range, and sheer volume of continuing characters he portrayed, which are currently taken up by several other voice talents. Indeed, as movie critic [[Leonard Maltin]] once pointed out, "It is astounding to realize that Tweety Bird and Yosemite Sam are the same man!"

According to Blanc, Sylvester the Cat was the easiest character to voice because "It's just my normal speaking voice with a spray at the end." Yosemite Sam was the hardest because of his loudness and raspiness.&lt;ref name="Blanc"/&gt;

A doctor who once examined Blanc's throat found that he possessed unusually thick, powerful vocal cords that gave him an exceptional range. The doctor reported that they rivaled those of opera singer [[Enrico Caruso]].&lt;ref name="Blanc"/&gt;

After his death, Blanc's voice continued to be heard in newly released productions, such as recordings of Dino the Dinosaur in the live-action films ''[[The Flintstones (film)|The Flintstones]]'' (1994) and ''[[The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas]]'' (2000). Similarly, recordings of Blanc as Jack Benny's Maxwell were featured in ''[[Looney Tunes: Back in Action]]'' (2003). More recently, archive recordings of Blanc have been featured in new [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]]-animated "Looney Tunes" theatrical shorts; ''[[I Tawt I Taw a Puddy Tat]]'' (shown with ''[[Happy Feet Two]]'') and ''[[Daffy's Rhapsody]]'' (shown with ''[[Journey 2: The Mysterious Island]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=78492 |title=More 3D Looney Tunes Shorts On The Way |publisher=ComingSoon.net |date= |accessdate=October 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vary |first=Adam B. |url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2011/11/14/tweety-bird-sylvester-looney-tunes-clip-exclusive/#more-53075 |title=Looney Tunes short with Tweety Bird, Sylvester - EXCLUSIVE CLIP|work=Entertainment Weekly |date= |accessdate=October 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blanc trained his son Noel in the field of voice characterization. Although the younger Blanc has performed his father's characters (particularly Porky Pig) on some programs, he has chosen not to become a full-time voice artist.

For his contributions to the radio industry, Mel Blanc has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6385 [[Hollywood Boulevard]]. His character Bugs Bunny also has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame (the only others to have received this honor are [[Walt Disney]] as both himself and [[Mickey Mouse]], [[Jim Henson]] as both himself and [[Kermit the Frog]], and [[Mike Myers]] as both himself and [[Shrek (character)|Shrek]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bugs Bunny|url=http://www.walkoffame.com/bugs-bunny|publisher=Hollywood Chamber of Commerce|accessdate=June 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
