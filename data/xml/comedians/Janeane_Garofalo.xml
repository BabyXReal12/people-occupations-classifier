'''Janeane Garofalo''' ({{IPAc-en|dʒ|ə|ˈ|n|iː|n|_|ɡ|ə|ˈ|r|ɒ|f|əl|oʊ}}; born September 28, 1964) is an American actress, stand-up comedian, and writer.

Garofalo began her career as a [[Stand-up comedy|stand-up comedian]] and became a cast member on ''[[The Ben Stiller Show]]'', ''[[The Larry Sanders Show]]'', and ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', then appeared in more than 50 movies, with leading or major roles in  ''[[The Truth About Cats and Dogs]]'', ''[[Wet Hot American Summer]]'', ''[[The Matchmaker (1997 film)|The Matchmaker]]'', ''[[Reality Bites]]'', ''[[Steal This Movie!]]'', ''[[Clay Pigeons]]'', ''[[Sweethearts (1997 film)|Sweethearts]]'', ''[[Mystery Men]]'', and ''[[The Independent (2000 film)|The Independent]]'', among numerous others.  She has been a series regular on television programs such as ''[[Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp]]'', ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'', and ''[[Girlfriends' Guide to Divorce]]''.&lt;ref name="imdb"&gt;{{IMDb name|0000413}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Garofalo is an outspoken [[Progressivism|progressive]] activist. From March 2004 to July 2006, she hosted [[Air America Radio]]'s ''[[The Majority Report]] ''with [[Sam Seder]].

==Early life==
Garofalo was born in [[Newton, New Jersey]], the daughter of Joan and Carmine Garofalo. Her mother, a secretary in the [[petrochemical]] industry, died of [[cancer]] when Janeane was 24. Her father is a former executive at [[Exxon]].&lt;ref name="houstonchronicle"&gt;{{cite news|first=Bruce|last=Westbook|title=Garofalo talks politics, 'evil oil empire' and life in Houston|work=[[Houston Chronicle]]|date=June 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Westbrook_HoustonChronicle_20070624&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=August 8, 2009|url=http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl?id=2007_4371183|title=The world according to Janeane Garofalo|work=Zest Magazine, Houston Chronicle|page=10|date=June 24, 2007|first=Bruce|last=Westbrook}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garofalo was raised in a conservative [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] family,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Span|first=Paula|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/27/arts/27span.html|title=And Don't Even Get Her Started on the War|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=April 27, 2005|accessdate=January 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is of Italian and Irish descent.

She grew up in [[Ontario, California]]; [[Madison, New Jersey]]; and [[Katy, Texas]], among other places. She was quoted as having disliked life in Texas because of the heat, humidity, and the emphasis on prettiness and sports in high school.&lt;ref name="houstonchronicle"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Westbrook_HoustonChronicle_20070624/&gt; While studying history at [[Providence College]], Garofalo entered a comedy talent search sponsored by the [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] cable network, winning the title of "Funniest Person in [[Rhode Island]]". Her original gimmick was to read off her hand, which was not successful in subsequent performances. Dreaming of earning a slot on the writing staff of the TV show ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'', she became a professional standup comedian upon graduating from college with degrees in History and [[American Studies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800018572/bio|title=Janeane Garofalo Biography|publisher=Movies.yahoo.com|accessdate=May 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She struggled for a number of years, working briefly as a [[bicycle messenger|bike messenger]] in [[Boston]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bostonphoenix.com/boston/news_features/this_just_in/documents/02169474.htm|title=Funny Girl: The real Garofalo|publisher=The Boston Phoenix|author=Nina Willdorf|accessdate=May 9, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609180135/http://www.bostonphoenix.com/boston/news_features/this_just_in/documents/02169474.htm|archivedate=June 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has described herself thus: "I guess I just prefer to see the dark side of things. The glass is always half empty. And cracked. And I just cut my lip on it. And chipped a tooth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/j/janeanegar163727.html|title=Janeane Garofalo Quotes|publisher=Brainy Quote|date=September 28, 1964|accessdate=May 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Entertainment career==
===Stand-up comedy===
{{BLP sources section|date=July 2012}}
[[File:Janeane Garofalo Jan 15, 2008.jpg|left|thumb|185px|Garofalo in 2008]]
Garofalo was initially known as a stand-up comedian, making numerous stand-up appearances on television and in live clubs and larger venues beginning in the 1990s and continuing today. She said she does not tell jokes as much as make observations designed to get laughs.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} She was part of the [[alternative comedy]] scene in Los Angeles in the early 1990s, appearing at [[Un-Cabaret]] and other venues, and she co-created the Eating It weekly stand-up comedy series, which ran at the [[Luna Lounge]] on the [[Lower East Side]] of [[New York City]] between 1995 and 2005, frequently hosting the show and appearing as a performer.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

She did an ''[[HBO Comedy Half-Hour]]'' special in 1995, among similar subsequent appearances, including a one-hour stand-up special in June 2010 entitled "If You Will," performed at Seattle's Moore Theatre, that aired on ''[[Epix (TV channel)|Epix]]'' in June 2010 and was released on DVD in September 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/44624/if-you-will|work=DVD Talk|title=If You Will|author=Jamie S. Rich}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During her filmed stand-up show in Seattle, she proclaimed herself [[asexuality|asexual]], and brought up her ten-year sexless relationship with her boyfriend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=J.M.|last=Suarez|title='Janeane Garofalo: If You Will': 'Life Is Too Long to Worry About the Afterlife'|publisher=[[PopMatters]]|date=October 4, 2010|accessdate=November 1, 2012|url=https://www.popmatters.com/131684-janeane-garofalo-if-you-will-2496131605.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film career===
Garofalo has performed a variety of leading, supporting and [[cameo appearance|cameo role]]s in more than 50 feature films, playing leading or large roles in ''[[Reality Bites]]'', ''[[The Truth About Cats and Dogs]]'', ''[[I Shot a Man in Vegas]]'', ''[[The Matchmaker (1997 film)|The Matchmaker]]'', ''[[Clay Pigeons]]'', ''[[Steal This Movie!]]'', ''[[Sweethearts (1997 film)|Sweethearts]]'', ''[[Mystery Men]]'', ''[[The Independent (2000 film)|The Independent]]'', ''[[Wet Hot American Summer]]'', ''[[Manhood (film)|Manhood]]'', ''[[Ash Tuesday]]'', and ''[[Bad Parents]]'', among others, and supporting roles in ''[[The Cable Guy]]'', ''[[Romy and Michele's High School Reunion]]'', ''[[Cop Land]]'', ''[[Half Baked]]'', ''[[Permanent Midnight]]'', ''[[Dogma (film)|Dogma]]'', ''[[200 Cigarettes]]'', and ''[[The Wild]]''.

Garofalo's first movie role, filmed the year before she appeared on national television, was a brief comical appearance as a counter worker in a burger joint in ''[[Late for Dinner]]'' in 1991, but her real breakthrough into film came in ''Reality Bites'' (1994) as [[Winona Ryder]]'s character's [[Gap (clothing retailer)|Gap]]-managing best friend Vickie. The role helped solidify Garofalo's status as a [[Generation X]] icon.

She remained visible from television work and supporting roles in feature films such as ''[[Bye Bye Love (film)|Bye Bye Love]]'' and ''[[Now and Then (film)|Now and Then]]'', and a leading role in ''[[I Shot a Man in Vegas]]'', until 1996 when she was cast in the starring role in the critically acclaimed [[romantic comedy]] ''[[The Truth About Cats &amp; Dogs]]'', a variation on ''[[Cyrano de Bergerac (play)|Cyrano de Bergerac]]'' which featured [[Billing (filmmaking)|top-billed]] [[Uma Thurman]] as a beautiful but dim-witted model, while Garofalo played the much larger role of Abby, a highly intelligent radio host. Initially an [[independent film]], it became a studio movie when Thurman was signed. The film was a modest hit, but Garofalo disparaged it back in 2003, saying:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Tasha|last=Robinson|title=Janeane Garofalo|date=December 24, 2003|publisher=[[The A.V. Club]]|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/janeane-garofalo-13846}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|I think it's soft and corny, and the soundtrack makes you want to puke, and everybody's dressed in [[Banana Republic (clothing retailer)|Banana Republic]] clothing. The original script and the original intent was very different than what it wound up being when it became a studio commercial film. It was originally supposed to be a small-budget independent film where there would be much more complexity to all the characters, and Abby and the guy don't wind up together at the end.|Janeane Garofalo|Interview, The A.V. Club}}

Based on the success of this film, a producer then offered her the [[leading lady]] role in ''[[Jerry Maguire]]'' with [[Tom Cruise]] if she could lose weight; after trimming down, however, she learned that [[Renée Zellweger]] had won the part instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Alison|last= Prato|title=Q &amp; A With Janeane Garofalo|date=August 11, 2009|url =http://www.inkedmag.com/articles/q-a-with-janeane-garofalo|work=Inked Magazine|accessdate=February 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She turned down the role of television reporter Gale Weathers in [[Wes Craven]]'s ''[[Scream (1996 film)|Scream]]'' because she thought the film would be too violent: "I said I didn't want to be in a movie where a teen girl was disemboweled. I didn't know it turned out so good, and it was a funny movie."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Matchmaker' helps Garofalo fall for Ireland|date=September 30, 1997|work=Boston Herald|accessdate=May 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Bad Parents 1431 (8056786389).jpg|thumb|right|Press for ''[[Bad Parents]]'']]
Garofalo had been [[David Fincher]]'s first choice for the role of Marla Singer in the film ''[[Fight Club]]'', but she turned it down, uncomfortable with the film's unusual sexual content (Fincher later noted that she was "uncomfortable with the idea of all this sex"), and [[Helena Bonham Carter]] eventually accepted the part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Story Behind Fight Club|work=Total Film|url=http://www.totalfilm.com/features/the-story-behind-fight-club|quote=The studio wanted Winona Ryder. Fincher wanted Janeane Garofalo, but she was "uncomfortable with the idea of all this sex"|date=November 20, 2009|accessdate=May 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following up the successful ''The Truth About Cats and Dogs'' in 1996, Garofalo played the leading role in ''[[The Matchmaker (1997 film)|The Matchmaker]]'', a 1997 [[romantic comedy]] film about the misadventures of a cynical American woman who reluctantly visits Ireland. That same year, she played a supporting role as a deputy sheriff in the drama ''[[Cop Land]]'', a police gangster film. In 1998, she performed her first voice-acting job playing "Ursula the Artist" in [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]'s English dub of [[Studio Ghibli]]'s ''[[Kiki's Delivery Service]]'' and briefly appeared in ''[[Permanent Midnight]]''. In 1999, she starred as "The Bowler" in the film ''[[Mystery Men]]'', about an underdog group of super heroes.&lt;ref name="imdb"/&gt;

In 2000, she portrayed [[Abbie Hoffman]]'s wife [[Anita Hoffman]] opposite [[Vincent D'Onofrio]] as Hoffman in ''[[Steal This Movie!]]'', involving the couple's political activism during the [[Vietnam War]] era. Later that same year, she received second billing under [[Jerry Stiller]] in a comedic film about a low-budget movie producer entitled ''[[The Independent (2000 film)|The Independent]]''. The following year, Garofalo was [[Billing (filmmaking)|top-billed]] in ''[[Wet Hot American Summer]]'', the 2001 [[cult film|cult]] comedy about an American summer camp, and starred in ''[[The Search for John Gissing]]''.&lt;ref name="imdb"/&gt;

In 2002, she played Catherine Connolly in ''[[The Laramie Project (film)|The Laramie Project]]'' and in 2003, she starred in ''[[Manhood (film)|Manhood]]'' and ''[[Ash Tuesday]]'', and appeared in the crime film ''[[Wonderland (2003 film)|Wonderland]]''. She played a supporting role in ''[[Jiminy Glick in Lalawood]]'' in 2004.&lt;ref name="imdb"/&gt;

A puppet version of Garofalo appeared (and was graphically killed off) in the 2004 movie ''[[Team America: World Police]]''; while Garofalo was irritated by the parody, she was more upset by the filmmaker's lack of correspondence. "I ran into them in the street, Trey and the other guy, and I said to them, 'The least you could do is send me a puppet.' And they said OK, took my address down ... and never sent me a puppet! So while Team America bothered me, the fact they didn't send me my puppet, that bothered me even more."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=James|last=Kettle|title=Seriously funny|date=August 1, 2009|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/aug/01/janeane-garofalo-edinburgh-fringe|work=The Guardian|accessdate=May 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, she played the ex-wife of a man coping with the reverberations of a divorce in ''[[Duane Hopwood]]''. In 2006, she performed Bridget the giraffe's voice in the computer-animated [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]] feature film ''[[The Wild (2006 film)|The Wild]]''. In 2007, she provided the voice of Colette, a chef in the [[Pixar]]/[[Disney]] feature film ''[[Ratatouille (film)|Ratatouille]]'', in which Garofalo affected a pronounced [[French accent]] for the role, appropriate for a character based on a French cook described as the world's best female chef.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dwyer|first=Chris|date=November 1, 2016|publisher=CNN|title=Meet Helene Darroze, world's best female chef|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/04/travel/culinary-journeys-helene-darroze|accessdate=April 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She made cameo appearances in ''[[The Guitar (film)|The Guitar]]'' in 2008 and ''[[Labor Pains]]'' in 2009, and starred in ''[[Bad Parents]]'' in 2012, a comedy about [[New Jersey]] [[soccer mom]]s obsessing over their children's experiences playing the sport. She starred in the 2015 film ''3rd Street Blackout''.&lt;ref name="imdb"/&gt;

Janeane Garofalo appears as herself in the documentary film ''[[Sticky: A (Self) Love Story]]'', released on Amazon in 2016, in which she claims that she had to get drunk on tequila to do her masturbation scene in the film ''Truth About Cats and Dogs''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Sticky-Self-Story-Janeane-Garofalo/dp/B01A9X9M6A|title=Sticky: A (Self) Love Story|publisher=Amazon.com|accessdate=June 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schonfeld|first=Zach|url=http://www.newsweek.com/remember-time-bill-clinton-fired-his-surgeon-general-encouraging-masturbation-423302|title=Remember That Time Bill Clinton Fired His Surgeon General for Encouraging Masturbation Education? |publisher=Newsweek.com|date=February 5, 2016|accessdate=June 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Allen|first=Samantha|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/sticky-documentary-dispels-myths-about-self-love|title='Sticky' Documentary Dispels Myths About Self-Love|publisher=The Daily Beast|date=January 22, 2016|accessdate=June 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television===
Garofalo's big break came in 1990 after meeting [[Ben Stiller]] at [[Canter's Deli]] in Los Angeles, where they were hanging out with stand-up friends. They bonded over their "love of ''[[Second City Television|SCTV]]'', early ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', and [[Albert Brooks]]."&lt;ref name="http://www.papermag.com/arts_and_style/1999/08/the-ben-stiller-show-n-tell.php"&gt;{{cite news|first=Christine|last=Muhlke|title=The Ben Stiller Show 'N' Tell|url=http://www.papermag.com/arts_and_style/1999/08/the-ben-stiller-show-n-tell.php|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130131063639/http://www.papermag.com/arts_and_style/1999/08/the-ben-stiller-show-n-tell.php|archive-date=January 31, 2013|date=August 1999|work=PaperMag|deadurl=yes|accessdate=August 16, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her first exposure on national television came soon thereafter by way of her appearance as a stand-up comic on MTV's ''Half Hour Comedy Hour''. Subsequently, her first television series debut was on the short-lived ''[[The Ben Stiller Show|Ben Stiller Show]]'' on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in 1992, on which she was a cast member alongside longtime friends  [[Bob Odenkirk]] and [[Andy Dick]].

A chance meeting on the set of that show led her to being offered the role of [[List of characters on The Larry Sanders Show#Paula|Paula]] on ''[[The Larry Sanders Show]]'' on [[HBO]], earning her two [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/janeane-garofalo|title=Janeane Garofalo|work=Television Academy}}&lt;/ref&gt; nominations in 1996 and 1997.  For a time, she was actually working on both series during the same period.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}
[[File:Janeanegarofalochair crop.jpg|thumb|left|Janeane Garofalo in 2008]]
After ''The Ben Stiller Show'' was cancelled, Garofalo joined the cast of ''[[Saturday Night Live]] (SNL)'' for its [[Saturday Night Live (Season 20)|1994–95 season]]. She left ''SNL'' in March 1995 (mid-season) after only six months, saying that the experience left her "anxious and depressed" and that a [[sexist]] attitude pervaded the show and she called many of the sketches "juvenile and homophobic".{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} According to ''[[New York Magazine]]'', Garofalo was "largely stuck in dull, secondary wife and girlfriend roles" and her friends said that she considered the stint "the most miserable experience of [her] life."&lt;ref name="NY Magazine 1995-03-13"&gt;{{cite news|first=Chris|last=Smith|title=Comedy Isn't Funny: How Saturday Night Live Became a Grim Joke|date=March 13, 1995|url=http://nymag.com/arts/tv/features/47548/index1.html|work=New York Magazine|accessdate=August 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following ''SNL'', Garofalo appeared in a plethora of guest star roles: the grown-up daughter of the Buchmans on the final episode of ''[[Mad About You]]''; [[Jerry Seinfeld (character)|Jerry Seinfeld]]'s female counterpart (and, briefly, fiancée) Jeannie Steinman on ''[[Seinfeld]]''; a recurring correspondent on [[Michael Moore]]'s ''[[TV Nation]]'', and a former girlfriend of [[Dave Foley]]'s character on ''[[Newsradio]]''.  She provided the voice for the weekly telephone conversations between the series lead and an older friend (Garofalo) in ''[[Felicity (TV series)|Felicity]]''. Two television pilots starring Garofalo, the 2003 [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] show ''Slice O'Life'' about a reporter consigned to sappy human interest stories appearing at the end of news broadcasts, and the 2005 [[NBC]] program ''All In'', based on the life of poker star [[Annie Duke]], were not picked up by their respective networks.

Throughout the 2005–06 television season, Garofalo appeared on ''[[The West Wing (TV series)|The West Wing]]'' as [[Louise Thornton]], a controversial campaign adviser to the fictional [[U.S. Democratic Party|Democratic]] presidential nominee. Garofalo participated in the series' first live episode, most of which was a debate televised live on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] and then reshot live for the [[West Coast of the United States|West]]. Garofalo's character can be seen walking backstage advising before the start of each debate. In 2006, she provided the voice for the animated character "Bearded Clam" on Comedy Central's ''[[Freak Show (TV series)|Freak Show]]''. In 2007, she wrote a dedication for the mini-book included in the six-DVD box-set of the 1994 [[cult following|cult]] series ''[[My So-Called Life]]''.

Garofalo had segments entitled "the disquisition" in several episodes of the 2007 season of ''[[The Henry Rollins Show]]'' which took place in her apartment, much in the same way [[Henry Rollins|Rollins']] segments take place at his house.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}  In 2009, Garofalo joined the cast of ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'', where she starred as [[Janis Gold]]. In 2010, Garofalo joined the cast of ''[[Ideal (TV series)|Ideal]]'' as Tilly. She was a cast member of the ''[[Criminal Minds]]'' short-lived spinoff TV series ''[[Criminal Minds: Suspect Behavior]]'' in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Episode of [[Sam Seder]]'s political podcast ''[[The Majority Report]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, she portrayed Lyla, an entertainment lawyer, in seven episodes of the TV series ''[[Girlfriends' Guide to Divorce]]''.  In 2015, she starred alongside most of the original cast in the [[Netflix]] [[Wet Hot American Summer (TV series)|eight-episode prequel]] to the 2001 comedy film ''[[Wet Hot American Summer]]''. In 2017, Garofalo starred in [[E4 (TV channel)|E4]]'s [[comedy-drama]] series [[Gap Year (TV series)|''Gap Year'']].&lt;ref name="IMDb"&gt;{{cite news|title=Gap Year: Cast|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5793948/fullcredits?ref_=tt_ov_st_sm|accessdate=April 14, 2017|work=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writing===
Garofalo co-wrote a comedic ''[[New York Times]]'' bestseller with [[Ben Stiller]] in 1999, entitled ''Feel This Book: An Essential Guide to Self-Empowerment, Spiritual Supremacy, and Sexual Satisfaction'', a spoof of the self-help books so prevalent at the time. She wrote her ''HBO Comedy Half-Hour'' along with similar appearances and programs, co-wrote some sketches on ''The Ben Stiller Show'', wrote an episode of the television series ''[[Head Case]]'', and wrote and directed a 2001 comedy short entitled ''Housekeeping''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Garofalo|first=Janeane|title=Housekeeping|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0447206/|others=Chris Anderson, Kate Cordaro, Peter Duffy|accessdate=2018-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political views==
Garofalo has been open and outspoken regarding her [[Progressivism|progressive]] political views. She is a staunch [[Feminism|feminist]].  In an interview for ''[[Geek Monthly]]'' magazine, she stated that she was raised in a [[Conservatism|conservative]] family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geekmonthly.com/blog/?p=191|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090320145429/http://geekmonthly.com/blog/?p=191|title=Janeane Garofalo profile|publisher=Geekmonthly.com|archivedate=March 20, 2009|date=January 13, 2009|accessdate=May 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She has appeared with political figures such as [[Ralph Nader]] (whom she supported in [[United States presidential election, 2000|the 2000 election]], but opposed in [[U.S. presidential election, 2004|2004]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}) and [[Jello Biafra]] at various events. In 2007, Garofalo described herself as an [[Atheism|atheist]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael Janusonis|url=http://www.projo.com/movies/content/ratstars_07-06-07_A964DOQ.25e3ad5.html|title=Just the right spice|publisher=projo.com|date=July 6, 2007|accessdate=May 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and participated in a radio interview by Freethought Radio, a show by the [[Freedom From Religion Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ffrf.libsyn.com/index.php?post_id=219697|title=Freethought Radio|publisher=Ffrf.libsyn.com|date=May 26, 2007|accessdate=May 9, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090831161127/http://ffrf.libsyn.com/index.php?post_id=219697|archivedate=August 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She became more prominent as a progressive when she voiced opposition to what became the [[2003 Iraq War]], appearing on [[CNN]] and [[Fox News]] to discuss it. She said that she was approached by groups such as ''[[MoveOn]].org'' and ''[[Win Without War]]'' to go on TV, because these organizations say that the networks were not allowing [[antiwar]] voices to be heard. Garofalo and the other celebrities who appeared at the time said they thought their fame could lend attention to that side of the debate. Her appearances on cable news prior to the war garnered her praise from the left and spots on the cover of ''[[Ms. magazine|Ms.]]'' and ''[[Venus Zine]]''. Garofalo has had frequent on-air political disputes with [[Bill O'Reilly (commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]], [[Brian Kilmeade]], and [[Jonah Goldberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/goldberg/goldberg022803.asp |title=Garofalo's World|author=Jonah Goldberg|publisher=Nationalreview.com|date=February 28, 2003|accessdate=May 9, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081226051905/http://www.nationalreview.com/goldberg/goldberg022803.asp|archivedate=December 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the 2003 Iraq War, she took a position on the alleged threat posed by [[Saddam Hussein]]. For example, in an interview with [[Tony Snow]] on a February 23, 2003 episode of ''[[Fox News Sunday]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,79351,00.html|title=Transcript: Janeane Garofalo on Fox News Sunday|publisher=FOXNews.com|date=February 24, 2003|accessdate=May 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garofalo said of the Iraqi [[dictator]]: 

{{quote|Yes, I think lots of people are eager to obtain [[weapons of mass destruction]]. But there's no evidence that he (Hussein) has weapons of mass destruction. There's been no evidence of him testing [[nuclear weapon]]s. We have people that are in our face with nuclear weapons. We've got Iran and North Korea. We've got a problem with Pakistan. You know, I don't know what to say about that. There's a whole lot of people that are going nuclear. And I think that Saddam Hussein is actually, with the evidence, the least able to use nuclear weapons and the least obvious offender in that area at this moment. |Janeane Garofalo|Fox News interview}}

In March 2003, she took part in the [[Code Pink]] anti-war march in Washington, D.C. That autumn, she served as emcee at several stops on the ''Tell Us the Truth'' tour, a political-themed concert series featuring [[Steve Earle]], [[Billy Bragg]], [[Tom Morello]], and others. Throughout the year, Garofalo also actively campaigned for [[Howard Dean]]. While on Fox News' program ''The Pulse'', O'Reilly asked Garofalo what she would do if her predictions that the Iraq war would be a disaster were to turn out wrong. Garofalo stated:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,83365,00.html|title=Hollywood Celebrities Pull Out the Punches on Iraq&amp;nbsp;– The Pulse|publisher=FOXNews.com|date=April 9, 2003|accessdate=May 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|I would be so willing to say, 'I'm sorry'. I hope to God that I can be made a buffoon of, that people will say, 'You were wrong. You were a fatalist.' And I will go to the White House on my knees on cut glass and say, 'Hey, you and Thomas Friedman were right ... I shouldn't have doubted you ...'|Janeane Garofalo| Fox News interview}}

Garofalo said she had misgivings in 2007 about the depiction of torture in the television series ''[[Critical reaction to 24#Torture|24]]'' but joined the cast because "being unemployed and being flattered that someone wanted to work with me outweighed my stance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/16/arts/television/16twen.html?_r=1|title=Deep Inside the Grim '24,' Two Comics' Inside Joke|last=Itzkoff|first=Dave|date=February 15, 2009|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=July 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2009, Garofalo drew criticism from ''[[The Washington Times]]'' when she denounced [[Tea Party protests]], which she referred to as racist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Carpenter|first=Amanda|url=http://washingtontimes.com/weblogs/back-story/2009/apr/17/liberal-actress-says-tea-parties-were-racist|title=Liberal actress says Tea Parties were racist|publisher=Washington Times|date=April 17, 2009|accessdate=May 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has continued to criticize Tea Party protesters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,519923,00.html|title=Garofalo Stands By 'Racist' Remarks -- Sean Hannity|publisher=FOXNews.com|date=May 12, 2009|accessdate=May 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Air America Radio===
In late March 2004, Garofalo became a co-host for [[Air America Radio]]'s new show ''[[The Majority Report]]'', alongside [[Sam Seder]]. The early days of Air America Radio are chronicled in the [[documentary film|documentary]] ''Left of the Dial'', which includes a debate between Garofalo and her conservative father Carmine, who was initially a regular guest on ''The Majority Report''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title="America Undercover" Left of the Dial (TV Episode 2005)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0454866/fullcredits|accessdate=2018-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Garofalo commented on her show of April 28, 2006 supporting the [[Scientology]]-linked [[New York Rescue Workers Detoxification Project]], a controversial treatment for workers suffering ailments from [[9/11]] clean-up efforts in New York City.&lt;ref name="msnbc1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12583654|title=Garofalo gushes over Scientology-linked project|last=Walls|first=Jeannette|date=May 2, 2006|work=[[MSNBC]]|publisher=NBC|accessdate=April 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Garofalo married [[Robert Cohen (writer)|Robert Cohen]], who was then a writer for ''The Ben Stiller Show'', in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] in 1991. She later explained it was intended to be a joke, foolishly thinking the marriage was not binding unless it had been filed at a local courthouse. It was discovered later, when Cohen tried to actually marry someone else, that the [[Las Vegas weddings|marriage]] was indeed legal. The union was dissolved in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Janeane-Garofalo-Married-1056115.aspx|title=Janeane Garofalo Had No Idea She Was Married for 20 Years|last=Stanhope|first=Kate|work=[[TV Guide]]|publisher=TVGuide.com|accessdate=November 13, 2012|date=November 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Garofalo's 2010 stand-up show, ''If You Will'', she says "I don't have a fear of intimacy, I have sort of a genuine lack of interest", adding jokingly, "which is not good for my boyfriend of ten years".&lt;ref&gt;Clip shown in ''(A) Sexual'', 2011 documentary film.&lt;/ref&gt;
