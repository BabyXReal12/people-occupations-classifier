She has been a magazine editor and continues to be a celebrity blogger, a [[LGBT social movements|lesbian rights]] activist, a television producer, and a collaborative partner in the [[LGBT]] family vacation company, [[R Family Vacations]].

O'Donnell started her comedy career while still a teenager.  Her big break was on the talent show ''[[Star Search]]'' in 1984. After a TV sitcom and a series of movies introduced her to a larger national audience, she hosted ''[[The Rosie O'Donnell Show]]'' from 1996 to 2002, which won multiple [[Emmy Awards]].  During this time, she wrote her first [[memoir]], ''[[Find Me (book)|Find Me]]'', and developed the nickname "Queen of Nice", as well as a reputation for philanthropic efforts.  She used the book's $3 million advance to establish her For All Kids [[Foundation (United States law)|foundation]] and promote other charity projects, encouraging celebrities on her show to take part. In 1997, O'Donnell did the voice of [[Terk (Tarzan)|Terk]] in the [[Disney]] animated film ''[[Tarzan (1999 film)|Tarzan]]''.

In 2002, two months before finishing her talk show run, O'Donnell [[coming out|came out]], stating "I'm a [[dyke (slang)|dyke]]!" and saying that her primary reason was to bring attention to [[LGBT adoption in the United States|gay adoption]] issues.  O'Donnell is a [[foster care|foster]] and [[adoption|adoptive]] mother. She was named ''[[The Advocate]]''{{'s}} 2002 Person of the Year; in May 2003, she became a regular contributor to the magazine.

In 2006, O'Donnell became a moderator on ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]''. Her strong opinions resulted in some controversies, including an on-air dispute regarding the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]]'s policies with the [[Iraq War]], resulting in a mutual agreement to cancel her contract. In 2007, O'Donnell released her second memoir, ''[[Celebrity Detox]]'', which focuses on her struggles with fame and her time at ''The View''. From 2009 to 2011, she hosted ''Rosie Radio'' on [[Sirius XM Radio]]. In 2011, O'Donnell signed on with the [[Oprah Winfrey Network (U.S. TV channel)|OWN: Oprah Winfrey Network]] to return to daytime TV with ''[[The Rosie Show]]''. On March 16, 2012, the network cancelled the show due to low ratings, and the last show aired on March 29, 2012. In July 2014, O'Donnell was rehired to join ''The View'' as a co-host for the series' eighteenth season. O'Donnell announced in February 2015 her decision to depart the series again, this time citing personal reasons for her departure.

In November 2016, [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] announced that O'Donnell had joined the cast of the comedy pilot ''[[SMILF]]'', which premiered on November 5, 2017.

==Early life==

==Career==

===Early work===
O'Donnell toured as a stand-up comedian in clubs from 1979 to 1984.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061111045509/http://www.eonline.com/celebrities/profile/index.jsp?uuid=c967a0ca-63f1-4edb-b3c6-ec4bdbbc0c4a Rosie O'Donnell profile], ''E!

{{quote|I was 20 years old, and I was at a comedy club in [[Long Island]]. This woman came over to me and she said, I think you're funny. Can you give me your number? My dad is [[Ed McMahon]]. I was like, yeah, right. I gave her my father's phone number. I was living at home, I'm like, whatever. And about three days later, the talent booker from ''Star Search'' called and said, we're going to fly you out to L.A. [...] I won, like, five weeks in a row. And it gave me national exposure.}}
[[Image:RosieODonnell.jpg|thumb|left|O'Donnell at the 1992 [[Emmy Awards]]]]

After this success, she moved on to television sitcoms, making her series debut as [[Nell Carter]]'s neighbor on ''[[Gimme a Break!]]'' in 1986.&lt;ref name=PeopleBioTimeline&gt;{{cite web|last=Wang|first=Julia|title=Rosie O'Donnell Biography|url=http://www.people.com/people/rosie_odonnell/biography/|work=People|publisher=Time Inc.|accessdate=February 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, she joined music video station [[VH1]]'s lineup of [[VJ (media personality)|veejays]].&lt;ref name=PeopleBioTimeline/&gt; She started hosting a series for VH1, ''[[Stand-up Spotlight]]'', a showcase for up-and-coming comedians.&lt;ref name=PeopleBioTimeline/&gt; In 1992, she starred in ''[[Stand By Your Man (TV series)|Stand By Your Man]]'', a [[Fox Network]] sitcom co-starring [[Melissa Gilbert]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Peterson|first=Bettelou|title=Gilbert, O'Donnell were in 'Stand by Your Man'|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2002&amp;dat=19930224&amp;id=lLYiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=GbUFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1567,5604853|accessdate=February 18, 2014|newspaper=[[The Beaver County Times]]|date=February 24, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show bombed, just as O'Donnell's movie career took off. O'Donnell made her feature film debut in ''[[A League of Their Own]]'' (1992) alongside [[Tom Hanks]], [[Geena Davis]], and [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]].&lt;ref name="actors" /&gt; She was originally considered for the role of Mary Sanderson in Disney's ''[[Hocus Pocus (1993 film)|Hocus Pocus]]'', but it was ultimately given to [[Kathy Najimy]]. O'Donnell claimed on her blog that she turned down the offer to work with [[Bette Midler]] because she refused to portray a frightening evil witch. Throughout her career, she has taken on an eclectic range of roles: she appeared in ''[[Sleepless in Seattle]]'' as [[Meg Ryan]]'s character's best friend; as [[Betty Rubble]] in the [[The Flintstones (film)|live-action film adaptation]] of ''[[The Flintstones]]'' with [[John Goodman]], [[Elizabeth Perkins]] and [[Rick Moranis]]; as one of [[Timothy Hutton]]'s co-stars in ''[[Beautiful Girls (film)|Beautiful Girls]]''; as a federal agent comedically paired with [[Dan Aykroyd]] in ''[[Exit to Eden (film)|Exit to Eden]]''; as the voice of a tomboyish female gorilla named Terk in [[Disney]]'s ''[[Tarzan (1999 film)|Tarzan]]''; and as a baseball-loving nun in [[M. Night Shyamalan]]'s ''[[Wide Awake (1998 film)|Wide Awake]]''.

===1996-2002: ''The Rosie O'Donnell Show''===
In 1996, she began hosting a [[Daytime television|daytime]] talk show, ''[[The Rosie O'Donnell Show]]''.&lt;ref name="TimbergErler2002"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Timberg|first1=Bernard M.|last2=Erler|first2=Bob|title=Television Talk: A History of the TV Talk Show|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9f4wu3uygR4C&amp;pg=PA183|accessdate=February 18, 2014|date=May 15, 2002|publisher=[[University of Texas Press]]|isbn=978-0-292-78176-4|page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show proved very successful, winning multiple [[Emmy Awards]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Neil|first=Tom|title=Can Rosie O'Donnell grab her old Emmy crown from Ellen DeGeneres?|url=http://goldderby.latimes.com/awards_goldderby/2010/03/can-rosie-odonnell-grab-her-old-emmy-crown-back-from-ellen.html|accessdate=February 18, 2014|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=March 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and earning O'Donnell the title of "The Queen of Nice" for her style of light-hearted banter with her guests and interactions with the audience.&lt;ref name="TimbergErler2002"/&gt; As part of her playful banter with her studio audience, O'Donnell often launched [[koosh ball]]s at the crowd and camera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chetwynd|first=Josh|title=The Secret History of Balls: The Stories Behind the Things We Love to Catch, Whack, Throw, Kick, Bounce and Bat|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4YXTQxelfmYC&amp;pg=PT65|accessdate=February 18, 2014|date=May 3, 2011|publisher=[[Penguin Group]]|isbn=978-1-101-51487-0|page=65|quote=Comedian Rosie O'Donnell made flinging Koosh Balls into her audience a staple on her talk show, which aired from 1996 to 2002.}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also professed an infatuation with [[Tom Cruise]].&lt;ref name=PeopleBio/&gt;

With New York City as the show's home base, O'Donnell displayed her love of Broadway musicals and plays by having cast members as guests, encouraging the audience to see shows, premiering production numbers as well as promoting shows with ticket giveaways.

After the [[Columbine shootings]], O'Donnell became an outspoken supporter of [[gun control]] and a major figure in the [[Million Mom March]].&lt;ref name="Amy Paulson"&gt;{{cite news|last=Paulson |first=Amy |title='Million Mom March' organizers hope to spur congressional action on gun legislation |work=[[CNN]] |date=May 8, 2000 |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/05/08/million.mom/index.html |accessdate=February 18, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110124102228/http://edition.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/05/08/million.mom/index.html |archivedate=January 24, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the April 19, 1999 broadcast of her talk show, she stated, "You are not allowed to own a gun, and if you do own a gun, I think you should go to prison."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gallant |first=Paul |last2=Eisen |first2=Joanne |last3=Kopel |first3=Dave |title=Her Own Bodyguard |work=[[National Review]] |date=January 24, 2002 |url=http://old.nationalreview.com/kopel/kopelprint012402.html |accessdate=February 18, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810205722/http://old.nationalreview.com/kopel/kopelprint012402.html |archivedate=August 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Donnell previously had remarked, "I don't personally own a gun, but if you are qualified, licensed and registered, I have no problem."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Silverman|first=Stephen|title=A Bodyguard for Rosie's Kid|publisher=People|date=September 11, 1998|url=http://people.com/celebrity/a-bodyguard-for-rosies-kid/|accessdate=July 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1999, a month after the Columbine shootings, O'Donnell interviewed [[Tom Selleck]], who was promoting ''[[The Love Letter (1999 film)|The Love Letter]]''. O'Donnell confronted him about his recent commercial for the [[National Rifle Association]] (NRA) and challenged him about the NRA's position on the use of "[[assault weapons]]." She said at the end of the segment the conversation had "not gone the way I had hoped" and added "if you feel insulted by my questions, I apologize because it was not a personal attack. It was meant to bring up the subject as it is in the consciousness of so many today."&lt;ref name="NRA Winning Team"&gt;{{cite web|title=TRANSCRIPT: Tom Selleck Visits "The Rosie O'Donnell Show"|publisher=NRA Winning Team|url=http://www.nrawinningteam.com/norosie.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19991004011259/http://nrawinningteam.com/norosie.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=October 4, 1999|accessdate=July 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Otherone"&gt;{{cite web|first =Otherone|title=Transcript of Tom Selleck &amp; Rosie O'Donnell's NRA Discussion|publisher=JLRweb|url =http://www.geocities.com/rofaq/nradebate.html|accessdate=July 11, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080302075026/http://www.geocities.com/rofaq/nradebate.html |archivedate=March 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same time, the cast from ''[[Annie Get Your Gun (musical)|Annie Get Your Gun]]'' was to appear on the show but refused O'Donnell's request to remove the line "I can shoot a partridge with a single cartridge" from the song "[[Anything You Can Do (song)|Anything You Can Do]]" and agreed to perform "My Defenses Are Down" instead.&lt;ref name="Report: Lyrics Riled Rosie"&gt;{{cite news|title=Report: Lyrics Riled Rosie|work=People|date=March 1, 1999|url=http://people.com/celebrity/report-lyrics-riled-rosie/feed/|accessdate=February 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in 1999, O'Donnell discontinued her contract with [[Kmart]] as their spokeswoman, as gun enthusiasts complained that she shouldn't be the spokesperson for the largest gun retailer. O'Donnell countered that Kmart sells hunting rifles, not handguns or assault weapons and does so legally, which she supports. Both Kmart and O'Donnell denied publicly that Kmart had terminated the contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fink|first=Mitchell|last2=Rubin|first2=Lauren|title=Rosie Sticks to Her Guns by Unloading Kmart Gig|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/gossip/rosie-sticks-guns-unloading-kmart-gig-article-1.857102|accessdate=February 15, 2014|newspaper=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|date=November 19, 1999|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2000, O'Donnell's bodyguard applied for a [[Carrying concealed weapon|concealed firearm permit]]. O'Donnell stated that the security firm contracted by [[Warner Bros.]] requested the gun. O'Donnell stated that because of threats, she and her family need protection.&lt;ref name="J.A.

After the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], Broadway and tourism in New York City was down and many shows were in danger of closing. O'Donnell was among many in the entertainment field who encouraged viewers to visit and support the [[performing arts]]. She announced that she would donate 1 million dollars for aid in the rescue efforts and encouraged other celebrities and citizens alike to "give till it hurts".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=O'donnell donates $1 million in aid|url=http://amarillo.com/stories/2001/09/20/usn_millionin.shtml|accessdate=February 18, 2014|newspaper=[[Amarillo Globe-News]]|date=September 20, 2001|agency=Associated Press|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227155752/http://amarillo.com/stories/2001/09/20/usn_millionin.shtml|archive-date=February 27, 2014|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, she left her talk show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Williams|first=Jeannie|title=Rosie, coy on TV, 'comes out' on stage|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/television/2002/2002-02-27-rosie.htm|accessdate=February 18, 2014|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|date=February 27, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show was replaced by ''[[The Caroline Rhea Show]]'', with comedian [[Caroline Rhea]], which ran for one additional season.

===2006-2007: ''The View''===

In September 2006, O'Donnell replaced [[Meredith Vieira]] as a co-host and moderator of ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]'', a daytime women-oriented talk show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Steinberg|first=Jacques|title=Rosie O'Donnell to Join the Cast of 'The View'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/29/arts/television/29rosi.html|accessdate=March 7, 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 29, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Star Jones]], a co-host on the show, quit, with some speculating Jones's conservative views would be in constant tension with O'Donnell's more liberal counterpoint. O'Donnell had also disputed Jones's route of rapid weight loss, alluding that it must have been through [[gastric bypass surgery]], rather than dieting and exercise alone as Jones had insisted, which also fed speculation about certain tension between the two.

O'Donnell gave the show a more political slant, and she and fellow comic [[Joy Behar]] often gave strong opinions against former President Bush's [[Domestic policy of the George W.

As a conservative counterpoint, [[Elisabeth Hasselbeck]] would usually support the [[Presidency of George W.

[[Jenny McCarthy]] appeared once briefly, as has Hasselbeck's mother-in-law and O'Donnell's mother-in-law, her (now) ex-wife Kelli's mother. [[Kathy Griffin]] also appeared, where she read some of the questions. It became so popular that O'Donnell and her creative team considered an "on the road" version of the video blog utilizing fan-submitted suggestions.

In November 2009 ,"Rosie Radio", a daily two-hour show with O'Donnell discussing news and events on [[Sirius XM Radio]], premiered.

===2011-2012: ''The Rosie Show'' and Oprah Winfrey Network===
In 2011, O'Donnell began producing material for the [[Oprah Winfrey Network (U.S. TV channel)|Oprah Winfrey Network]] (OWN). In May 2011, ''The Doc Club with Rosie O'Donnell'' premiered, a show where O'Donnell moderates live panel discussions following premieres of OWN Documentaries. She has hosted specials for ''Becoming Chaz'' in May 2011 and ''[[Miss Representation]]'' in October 2011.

In fall 2011, O'Donnell began full-time work on her new show, ''[[The Rosie Show]]'', for OWN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Roger|last=Friedman|url=http://www.showbiz411.com/2010/09/21/rosie-odonnell-producing-chaz-bono-film-for-oprah-network|title=Rosie O'Donnell Producing Chaz Bono Film for Oprah Network|accessdate=September 21, 2010|date=September 21, 2010|work=[[Showbiz411]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show taped at the Chicago studio formerly home to ''The Oprah Winfrey Show''.

OWN canceled ''The Rosie Show'' on March 16, 2012, with the last show taped March 20, on the eve of O'Donnell's 50th birthday. The final show aired on OWN on March 29, 2012. In a statement, Oprah Winfrey said: 
{{Cquote|I thank Rosie from the bottom of my heart for joining me on this journey. She has been an incredible partner, working to deliver the best possible show every single day.

O'Donnell responded to the cancellation by thanking her viewers and the host city of Chicago: 
{{Cquote|I loved working with Oprah in the amazing city of Chicago. I was welcomed with open arms and will never forget the kindness of all I encountered. It was a great year for me—I wish the show was able to attract more viewers—but it did not. So I am headed back to my home in New York—with gratitude. On we go!"&lt;ref name="ZapFinale"/&gt;}}

===2013–present: ''The Fosters'', ''The View'' &amp; ''SMILF''===
In 2013, O'Donnell appeared in a number of television shows.

In 2014, O'Donnell landed a reoccurring role as Rita Hendricks on ''[[The Fosters (2013 TV series)|The Fosters]]'', "a tough yet compassionate woman who works for the foster care system and becomes a mentor to a member of the Foster family."&lt;ref name="Goldberg The Fosters"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Goldberg|first1=Lesley|title=Rosie O'Donnell Joins ABC Family's 'The Fosters'|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/rosie-odonnell-joins-abc-familys-fosters-630547|accessdate=November 11, 2016|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=September 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character lasted through their 2016 season.&lt;ref name="The Fosters"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Aguilera|first1=Leanne|title=EXCLUSIVE: Rosie O'Donnell Is Back on 'The Fosters' and She Calls Callie Out on Her 'Teenager' Behavior!|url=http://www.etonline.com/tv/182626_exclusive_rosie_o_donnell_is_back_on_the_fosters_and_she_calls_callie_out_on_her_teenager_behavior/|accessdate=November 11, 2016|publisher=ET Online|date=February 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fall of 2014, O'Donnell returned to ''The View'' as a co-host, with a newly re-vamped version of the show, along with [[Whoopi Goldberg]] returning as moderator and new co-hosts [[Rosie Perez]] and [[Nicolle Wallace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/rosie-o-donnell-confirmed-return-view-article-1.1861945|title=Rosie O'Donnell confirmed to return to 'The View' as co-host|author=Cristina Everett|newspaper=New York Daily News|date=July 10, 2014|accessdate=July 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 6, 2015, representatives for O'Donnell confirmed she would once again exit the panel, citing her reasons as a "personal decision".&lt;ref name="View Exit"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mohr|first1=Ian|last2=Smith|first2=Emily|title=Rosie O'Donnell quits 'The View' and splits with wife|url=http://pagesix.com/2015/02/06/rosie-odonnell-leaves-the-view-and-her-wife/|accessdate=February 7, 2015|work=[[New York Post]]|agency=[[News Corp]]|publisher=pagesix.com|date=February 6, 2015|location=United States}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a statement, made to ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', O'Donnell said, "[My health] got a little bit worse right before the holidays — [my doctor] was kind of concerned.

In 2015, O'Donnell made a cameo in ''[[Pitch Perfect 2]]'', playing a co-host on ''The View''.

In April 2015, ''Roseanne For President!'' was released, a film about [[Roseanne Barr]]'s presidential bid in 2012.

==Other ventures==

===''Rosie'' magazine===
{{Main|McCall's}}
In 2000, O'Donnell partnered with the publishers of ''[[McCall's]]'' to revamp the magazine as ''Rosie's McCall's'' (or, more commonly, ''Rosie'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jacobson|first=Aileen|title=Tv Host O'donnell to Add Name to Venerable Mccall's Magazine|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2000-11-18/lifestyle/0011170650_1_jahr-usa-namesake-magazine-rosie-o-donnell|accessdate=February 18, 2014|newspaper=[[Sun-Sentinel]]|date=November 18, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine was launched as a competitor to fellow talk show hostess Oprah Winfrey's monthly magazine ''[[O, The Oprah Magazine|O]]''. ''Rosie'' covered issues including breast cancer, [[foster care]] and other matters of concern to O'Donnell. In the September 2000 issue, she shared that "she has struggled with depression her entire life" and decided to start medications when she realized her fears were affecting her family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=How Rosie O'Donnell Beat Depression|url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Depression/story?id=126783&amp;page=1&amp;singlePage=true|accessdate=February 19, 2014|newspaper=[[ABC News]]|date=August 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a strong start and a circulation close to 3.5 million, things looked promising but the magazine stumbled as conflicts emerged between O'Donnell and the editors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Carr|first=David|title=O'Donnell and Her Publisher Are in Clash Over Magazine|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/23/business/media/23MAG.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=March 7, 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 23, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contract gave O'Donnell control over editorial process and editorial staff but veto power remained with publisher Gruner+Jahr USA.&lt;ref name="MagWar"&gt;{{cite news|last=Offman|first=Craig|title=O'Donnell countersues in mag war|url=https://variety.com/2002/biz/news/o-donnell-countersues-in-mag-war-1117874695/|accessdate=March 7, 2014|newspaper=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=October 21, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Donnell quit the magazine in September 2002, following a dispute over editorial control.&lt;ref name="MagWar"/&gt; "If I'm going to have my name and my brand on the corner of a magazine, it has to be my vision" she told ''People''.&lt;ref name="PeopleBio2"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wang|first=Julia|title=Rosie O'Donnell Biography|url=http://www.people.com/people/rosie_odonnell/biography/0,,20033874_10,00.html|work=People|publisher=Time Inc.|accessdate=February 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Rosie'' magazine folded in 2003. In late 2003, O'Donnell and the publishers each sued the other for [[breach of contract]]. The publishers claimed that, by removing herself from the magazine's publication, she was in breach of contract. The trial received considerable press coverage. O'Donnell would often give brief press interviews outside of the courtroom responding to various allegations. Of note was a former magazine colleague and breast cancer survivor who testified that O'Donnell said to her on the phone that people who lie "get sick and they get cancer. If they keep lying, they get it again".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cancer survivor says Rosie O'Donnell told her liars get cancer|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2003-11-05-rosie-suit_x.htm|accessdate=February 18, 2014|newspaper=USA Today|date=November 5, 2003|agency=AP}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Donnell apologized the next day and stated "I'm sorry I hurt her the way I did, that was not my intention." The judge dismissed the case, ruling that neither side should receive [[damages]].&lt;ref name="Prono2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Prono|first=Luca|title=Encyclopedia of Gay and Lesbian Popular Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y3FYzMPH2OwC&amp;pg=PA205|accessdate=January 1, 2013|year=2008|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9780313335990|page=205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Books===
In 1997, Rosie released the children's book ''Kids are Punny: Jokes Sent by Kids to the Rosie O'Donnell Show'', which contained jokes she had received from children.  A sequel titled ''Kids are Punny 2: More Jokes Sent by Kids to the Rosie O'Donnell Show'' was released a year later in 1998, and an [[HBO]] special was made based on the books.  In April 2002, O'Donnell released ''[[Find Me (book)|Find Me]],'' a combination of memoir, mystery and detective story with an underlying interest in reuniting birth mothers with their children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kuczynski|first=Alex|title=She's Out of the Closet.

The book reached number two on ''The New York Times'' bestseller list.

In October 2007, she released ''[[Celebrity Detox]]'', her second memoir which focuses on the struggles with leaving fame behind, noting her exits from ''The Rosie O'Donnell Show'' and ''The View''.

===R Family Vacations===
In 2003, O'Donnell and Carpenter partnered with travel entrepreneur Gregg Kaminsky to launch [[R Family Vacations]] catering to LGBT families, "the very first all gay and lesbian family vacation packages" where "gays and lesbians can bring their kids, their friends, and their parents."&lt;ref name="Kaminsky"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kaminsky|first=Gregg|title=Rosie O'Donnell Announces R Family Vacations|publisher=Out in Buffalo|date=August 11, 2003|url=http://www.outinbuffalo.com/home/news.asp?articleid=4916|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030929064549/http://www.outinbuffalo.com/home/news.asp?articleid=4916|dead-url=yes|archive-date=September 29, 2003|accessdate=June 21, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although O'Donnell is not involved on a day-to-day basis, she does contribute to the creative aspects of "advertising and marketing materials" and initiated the idea for the company when she filled in as a last-minute replacement headliner on one of Kaminsky's [[Atlantis Events]] gay cruises and also came up with the name "R Family Vacations."&lt;ref name="Salvato"&gt;{{cite web|last=Salvato |first=Ed |title=R Family Vacations plies uncharted gay waters |publisher=[[Planet Out]] |url=http://www.planetout.com/travel/article.html?sernum=9101 |accessdate=June 21, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060508152020/http://www.planetout.com/travel/article.html?sernum=9101 |archivedate=May 8, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 11, 2004, the first cruise was held with 1600 passengers&lt;ref name="Planet Out"&gt;{{cite web|title=Q and A with Rosie and Kelli on "All Aboard!

Rosie's Family Cruise]]'', a documentary film about the trip debuted on [[HBO]] on April 6, 2006, and was nominated for three [[Emmy Awards]]. Of the experience, O'Donnell stated "we didn't really realize the magic that was going to take place. People who had never met another gay family met other families and it was powerful."&lt;ref name=Davis/&gt;

===''Taboo'' ===
In late 2003, O'Donnell brought the musical ''[[Taboo (musical)|Taboo]]'' to Broadway. She hired [[Charles Busch]] to re-write the [[Book (musical theatre)|book]], and the story became "bitchier" and more focused on the rise to fame of the character based on [[Boy George]].&lt;ref name="Miller2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Scott|title=Sex, Drugs, Rock &amp; Roll, and Musicals|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZkPAYsbhHMUC&amp;pg=PT405|accessdate=January 1, 2013|date=October 11, 2011|publisher=UPNE|page=405}}&lt;/ref&gt; It closed on February 8, 2004, after about 100 performances and "mostly bad" reviews.&lt;ref name="Shirley2004"&gt;{{cite news|last=Shirley|first=Don|title=A $10-million Broadway flop for O'Donnell|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2004/jan/15/news/wk-quick15|accessdate=March 8, 2014|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=January 15, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Donnell described the show's production as "by far the most fulfilling experience of my career".&lt;ref name="Shirley2004"/&gt; She has stated that she intends to bring the show back to Broadway, although Scott Miller writes that people are hesitant to get involved after the "train wreck" of the original production.&lt;ref name="Miller2011"/&gt;

==Charitable work==
Over her career, O'Donnell has developed a reputation for raising funds and her own philanthropy to charitable causes. In May 1996, [[Warner Books]] advanced O'Donnell $3 million to write a [[memoir]].&lt;ref name="PeopleBio2"/&gt; She used the money to seed her For All Kids Foundation to help institute national standards for day care across the country.&lt;ref name="PeopleBio2"/&gt;

==Personal life==
O'Donnell was a resident of [[Nyack, New York]] after the purchase in 1996 of "Pretty Penny," a Victorian river home that had previously served as the home of [[Helen Hayes]], the American actress and "First Lady of the American Theater."

===Sexual orientation===
In her January 31, 2002 appearance on the sitcom ''[[Will &amp; Grace]]'', she played a lesbian mom. A month later as part of her act at the Ovarian Cancer Research benefit at [[Caroline's Comedy Club]] O'Donnell [[coming out|came out]] as a lesbian, announcing "I'm a [[Dyke (slang)|dyke]]!" "I don't know why people make such a big deal about the gay thing. ...

Although she also cited the need to put a face to gays and lesbians, her primary reason was to bring attention to the [[gay adoption]] issue. O'Donnell is a foster and adoptive mother. She protested against adoption agencies, particularly in Florida, that refused adoptive rights to gay and lesbian parents.

[[Diane Sawyer]] interviewed O'Donnell in a March 14, 2002, episode of ''[[Primetime (U.S. TV program)|PrimeTime Thursday]]''. O'Donnell told ''[[USA Today]]'' that she chose to talk to Sawyer because she wanted an investigative piece on Florida's ban on gay adoption. She told Sawyer if that was done, "I would like to talk about my life and how (the case) pertains to me." She spoke about the two gay men in Florida who faced having a foster child they raised removed from their home. State law wouldn't let them adopt because Florida banned gay or [[bisexual]] people from adopting.&lt;ref name=Coy2002/&gt; O'Donnell's coming out drew criticism from some LGBT activists who cited her repeated references to being enamored of Tom Cruise on ''The Rosie O'Donnell Show'' as deceptive.&lt;ref name=Coy2002/&gt; She responded in her act stating, "I said I wanted him to mow my lawn and bring me a lemonade.

O'Donnell told the press that her haircut was meant to mimic the haircut of former [[Culture Club]] backup singer [[Helen Terry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tauber|first=Michelle|first2=Cynthia|last2=Wang|first3=Mark|last3=Dagostino|first4=Lynda|last4=Wright|first5=Liza|last5=Hamm|first6=Linda|last6=Trischitta|first7=Tom|last7=Duffy|title=The War of the Rosies|journal=People|date=October 7, 2002|volume=58|issue=15|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20138165,00.html|accessdate=March 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parker is an [[aficionado]] of [[military history]] and, in 2011, successfully lobbied his mother to send him to [[Valley Forge Military Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Zach (November 8, 2011).

Her decision to go to San Francisco to marry Carpenter was seen as a show of defiance against then-[[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[George W. Bush]] over his support for the [[Federal Marriage Amendment]]. She said in 2004, "We were both inspired to come here after the sitting President made the vile and hateful comments he made ...

As a result, everything that I said to Kelli, every letter that I wrote her, every e-mail, every correspondence and conversation was entered into the record ... I am now and will forever be a total proponent of [[gay marriage]]."&lt;ref name="Rosie O'Donnell Weds Long"/&gt;

In 2001, the state of Florida removed Mia from their home, and O'Donnell has since worked extensively to bring an end to the Florida law prohibiting same-sex family adoption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywood.com/celebrity/Rosie_ODonnell/189622|title=Rosie O'Donnell|date=|work=Hollywood.com|accessdate=March 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0207/06/lklw.00.html CNN.com transcript of ''Larry King Live'' Interview of O'Donnell]&lt;/ref&gt;
