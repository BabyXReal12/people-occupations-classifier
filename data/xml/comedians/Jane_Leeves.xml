'''Jane Elizabeth Leeves''' (born 18 April 1961) is an English actress, model, producer, comedienne, singer, and dancer.  She is best known for playing [[Daphne Moon]] on the television sitcom ''[[Frasier]]'' from 1993 until 2004, for which she was nominated for [[Emmy Awards]] and [[Golden Globe Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= How Benny Hill babe Jane Leeves became the queen of U.S. TV|work= Daily Mail|date=30 July 2010|url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1298828/How-Benny-Hill-babe-Jane-Leeves-queen-U-S-TV.html|accessdate=16 August 2010 | location=London | first=Lina | last=Das}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is also known for her role as [[Joy Scroggs]] on [[TV Land]]'s sitcom ''[[Hot in Cleveland]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cleveland.com/tv/index.ssf/2010/01/valerie_bertinelli_jane_leeves.html |title=Valerie Bertinelli, Jane Leeves and Wendie Malick will be 'Hot in Cleveland' |work=[[The Plain Dealer]] |first=Mark |last=Dawidziak |date=14 January 2010 |accessdate=14 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leeves made her screen debut with a small role in 1983 on the British comedy television show ''[[The Benny Hill Show]]'', and appeared as a dancer in ''[[Monty Python's The Meaning of Life]]''. She moved to the United States, where she performed in small roles. From 1986 to 1988, she had her first leading role in the short-lived sitcom ''[[Throb]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090533/|title=Throb (TV Series 1986–1988)|author=sschwart|publisher=Internet Movie Database}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then secured a recurring part in the television sitcom ''[[Murphy Brown]]''.  She received further recognition for roles in films such as ''[[Miracle on 34th Street (1994 film)|Miracle on 34th Street]]'' (1994), ''[[James and the Giant Peach (film)|James and the Giant Peach]]'' (1996), ''[[Music of the Heart]]'' (1999), and ''[[The Event (2003 film)|The Event]]'' (2003).

== Early life ==
Leeves was born in [[Ilford]], Essex before moving to [[Crawley]], West Sussex and then [[East Grinstead]], West Sussex. She trained as a [[ballet dancer]] at the Bush Davies School of Dance and worked as a model until she made her first film appearance in ''[[Monty Python's The Meaning of Life]].'' She abandoned the possibility of a career in [[ballet]] because of an ankle injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085959/fullcredits#cast |title=Full Cast of The Meaning of Life on IMDB |publisher=Internet Movie Database |accessdate=17 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
[[File:Jane Leeves at the Emmys.jpg|upright|left|thumb|Leeves at the 1994 Emmys]]
Leeves was a regular on ''[[The Benny Hill Show]]'' (as one of "Hill's Angels"), later making use of her experience as a dancer in a scene in ''Monty Python's The Meaning of Life'' and appeared as a tourist with a baby in the [[David Lee Roth]] music video for the song "California Girls", but struggled for several years to establish herself. She became somewhat visible as the flighty record company employee, Blue (née Prudence Anne Bartlett), on the syndicated sitcom ''[[Throb!]]''.

She had a recurring role in the television series ''[[Murphy Brown]]'' which provided her first period of success, playing Audrey, the smart but awkward girlfriend of producer Miles Silverberg (played by [[Grant Shaud]]). Leeves also appeared as the troublesome [[List of Seinfeld minor characters#Characters appearing in fewer than 5 episodes|Marla the Virgin]] in four risqué episodes of ''[[Seinfeld]]'': "[[The Virgin (Seinfeld)|The Virgin]]", "[[The Contest]]", "[[The Pilot (Seinfeld episode)|The Pilot]]", and "[[The Finale (Seinfeld episode)|The Finale – Part 2]]". During this period, Leeves was cast as [[Holly (Red Dwarf)|Holly]] for the pilot of the US version of the science-fiction comedy ''[[Red Dwarf]].'' She also had a role as a lesbian avant-garde dancer in the 1985 film ''[[To Live and Die in L.A. (film)|To Live and Die in L.A.]]''

In 1993, Leeves joined the cast of the television series ''Frasier''. She played the eccentric, forthright, and allegedly psychic [[Manchester|Mancunian]] [[Daphne Moon]]. By the start of the eighth season, Leeves was pregnant, and the writers incorporated her pregnancy into shows as weight gain due to her character's stress from her relationship with Niles (portrayed by [[David Hyde Pierce]]). By the conclusion of ''Frasier'', Leeves had received a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series]] nomination in 1998 and also a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Series, Miniseries or Television Film]] nomination in 1995 for her role and had become the highest-paid British actress in Hollywood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/jane-leeves/person/1207/trivia.html?tag=page_nav;subtabs;trivia |title=Jane Leeves |publisher=TV.com }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Appearing less frequently in cinema, Leeves lent her speaking voice and singing voice to the animated film ''[[James and the Giant Peach (film)|James and the Giant Peach]]'' (1996) as Mrs. Ladybug and acted in the film ''[[Music of the Heart]]'' (1999). In 2002, she appeared in the Broadway musical ''[[Cabaret (musical)|Cabaret]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.broadway.com/Jane-Leeves-Sets-Dates-for-Bways-Cabaret/broadway_news/8069 |title=Jane Leeves Sets Dates for B'way's Cabaret – Broadway Tickets |publisher=Broadway.com |date=19 February 2002 |accessdate=23 March 2009 }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, she hosted an episode of the television comedy quiz show ''[[Have I Got News for You]]''. Her 2006 show, [[The WB]]'s sitcom ''Misconceptions'', went unaired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dyess-Nugent, Harris, VanDerWerff|first1=Phil, Will, Todd|title=The unseen: 24 TV shows produced but never properly aired|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/the-unseen-24-tv-shows-produced-but-never-properly-69546|website=AV Club|publisher=Onion, Inc.|accessdate=4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:JaneLeevesHWOFAug2012.jpg|thumb|upright|Leeves in August 2012]]
Leeves provided guest vocals in ''[[The Penguins of Madagascar]]'' as Lulu, a female chimp, with which Phil fell in love. With [[Peri Gilpin]], Leeves also set up the production company Bristol Cities ([[cockney rhyming slang]] for 'titties').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Jo7gAjlWnc|title=Jane Leeves on Graham Norton|last=Janeleeves2|date=12 October 2009|publisher=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their last project was in 2007, a pilot for a US remake of the British sitcom ''[[The Vicar of Dibley]]'', with [[Kirstie Alley]] in the title role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/us-version-of-vicar-of-dibley-to-star-kirstie-alley-435337.html |title=US version of 'Vicar of Dibley' to star Kirstie Alley – Media, News |work=The Independent |date=7 February 2007 |accessdate=23 March 2009 | location=London | first=Terry | last=Kirby}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Leeves was a guest star in two episodes in [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC's]] ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'' as [[Lynette Scavo|Lynette]] and [[Tom Scavo|Tom]]'s therapist, Dr. Graham. From 2010 until 2015, she played the 40-something ex 'eyebrow artist to the stars' Joy Scroggs in the [[TV Land]] comedy, ''[[Hot in Cleveland]]'', with [[Valerie Bertinelli]], [[Wendie Malick]] (also her co-star in the final season of ''Frasier''), and [[Betty White]]. In 2011, she was nominated [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series]] along with the rest of the cast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2010/12/16/sag-awards-tv-nominations/|title=SAG's TV nominations: What did they miss?|work=Entertainment Weekly's EW.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Leeves has been married to Marshall Coben, a [[CBS Paramount Television]] executive, since 21 December 1996. They have two children; her pregnancy with daughter Isabella Kathryn Coben (born 9 January 2001) was written into a ''[[Frasier]]'' plot as a weight-gaining problem for her character. ''Frasier'' co-star [[Peri Gilpin]] was in the delivery room when Isabella was born, and is her godmother. Leeves is godmother of Gilpin's daughter Stella, and lives next door to Gilpin in Los Angeles, California. Leeves' son, Finn William Leeves Coben (born 19 December 2003) has [[David Hyde Pierce]] and [[John Mahoney]] as godfathers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/you/article-1354896/Jane-Leeves-Hot-Cleveland-struck-sitcom-gold-again.html|title=Jane Leeves in Hot in Cleveland has struck sitcom gold again |work=Daily Mail |date=13 February 2011 |accessdate=20 March 2011 | first=Jane | last=Mulkerrins}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2012, Leeves posed in an ad for the [[NOH8 Campaign]], which supports the [[LGBT community]].&lt;ref name="ontop"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ontopmag.com/article/10635/Hot_In_Clevelands_Valerie_Bertinelli_Wendie_Malick_Jane_Leeves_Join_NOH8_Campaign|title=&amp;#39;Hot in Cleveland&amp;#39;s&amp;#39; Valerie Bertinelli, Wendie Malick, Jane Leeves Join NOH8 Campaign {{!}} On Top Magazine {{!}} LGBT News &amp; Entertainment|work=On Top|publisher=On Top Media|date=13 January 2012|accessdate=15 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
