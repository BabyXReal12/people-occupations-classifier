'''Tony Declan James Slattery''' (born 9 November 1959), is an English actor and comedian. He has appeared on British television regularly since the mid-1980s, most notably as a regular on the [[Channel 4]] improvisation show ''[[Whose Line Is It Anyway? (UK TV series)|Whose Line Is It Anyway?]]''  His serious and comedic film work has included roles in ''[[The Crying Game]]'', ''[[Peter's Friends]]'', and ''[[How to Get Ahead in Advertising]]''.

==Early life and education==
Slattery was born in [[Stonebridge, London|Stonebridge]],  north London, into a [[working class|working-class]] background, the fifth and last child of Irish immigrants, Michael and Margaret Slattery.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/all-the-rage-and-how-he-survived-it-tony-slattery-1158324.html Deborah Ross: "All the rage, and how he survived it: Tony Slattery"], ''The Independent'' (London), 18 May 1998&lt;/ref&gt; He was much younger than his sister, Marlene, and his triplet brothers, Christopher, Michael and Stephen.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

In his youth, Slattery represented England in under-15 judo, achieving a black belt before he was 16.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} He was educated at [[Gunnersbury Catholic School|Gunnersbury Boys' Grammar School]] in [[London|west London]] and won a scholarship to read Modern and Medieval Languages at [[Trinity Hall, Cambridge]], specialising in French literature and Spanish poetry.

At the University of Cambridge, Slattery discovered a love of the theatre, taking delight in making people laugh. He met [[Stephen Fry]], who invited him to join the [[Cambridge Footlights]]. Other members at that time included [[Hugh Laurie]], [[Emma Thompson]], [[Sandi Toksvig]] , [[Jan Ravens]] and [[Richard Vranch]].

In 1981, Slattery, Fry, Laurie, Thompson and Toksvig won the inaugural [[Perrier Award]] for their revue ''[[The Cellar Tapes]]''. The following year, Slattery was made President of the Footlights. During his tenure, the touring annual [[revue]] was ''Premises Premises''.

==Television and film career==
Slattery first broke into television as a regular performer on [[Chris Tarrant]]'s follow up to ''[[O.T.T.]]'', ''[[Saturday Stayback]]'' (1983), while also appearing for children in ''Behind the Bike Sheds'' and the Saturday-morning show ''TX''. By 1989 he was a regular on ''[[Whose Line Is It Anyway? (UK TV series)|Whose Line Is It Anyway?]]'', starred in his own improvisational comedy series, ''S&amp;M'', alongside [[Mike McShane]], and appeared on other panel quizzes such as ''[[Have I Got News for You]]''. He was a regular on the TV version of the quiz show ''[[Just a Minute]]'' and was also on the radio version several times, including the live version held at the [[Edinburgh International Festival|Edinburgh Festival]].

As a dramatic actor he has appeared in ''[[The Crying Game]]'', ''[[To Die For (1994 film)|To Die For]]'', ''[[Peter's Friends]]'' and ''The Wedding Tackle''.

At the end of the 1980s he became a film critic, presenting his own show on British television, ''Saturday Night at the Movies''. He also appeared in the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] sitcom ''[[That's Love]]'' with [[Jimmy Mulville]]. Other TV appearances include ''The Music Game'' alongside [[Richard Vranch]] and as a regular guest with both [[Ruby Wax]] and [[Clive Anderson]]. In 1988, Slattery appeared in the BBC sci-fi comedy series ''[[Red Dwarf]]'', in the episode "Kryten" he played the voice of the main character on Kryten's favourite soap opera, "Androids" (a parody of ''[[Neighbours]]'').

He has also been a regular guest with the Comedy Store Players, both at the [[The Comedy Store, London|Comedy Store]] in London and on tour.

Early in the 1990s he appeared on many TV shows to the extent that he was a target of satire. For example, the ''[[Have I Got News for You]]'' 1991 [[annual publication|annual]] showed images of the game from around the world, and each local variant featured Slattery as a guest. ''[[Spitting Image]]'' showed a sketch in which an [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphised]] [[BBC Two|BBC2]] logo refused to have [[BBC Two '1991–2001' idents|blue paint splattered on it]] and Slattery intervened for the sake of publicity. The satirical magazine ''[[Private Eye (magazine)|Private Eye]]'' once published a memorable [[cartoon]] depicting his [[answering machine]] with the outgoing message "Yes, I'll do it!"

In 1992 he appeared in the film ''[[Carry On Columbus]]''. In the same year he appeared in the series ''Dead Ringer'', filmed for the observation round in ''[[The Krypton Factor]]''.

Also in 1992 Slattery appeared as a contestant on the Channel 4 show ''[[GamesMaster]]'', in which he said that he hated video games, despite the show being entirely devoted to them. He played the real-time arcade shooter ''[[Who Shot Johnny Rock?]]'', failing the challenge by shooting an innocent victim in the game.

In 1993 he starred in the ITV sitcom ''[[Just a Gigolo (TV series)|Just a Gigolo]]''. Only one series was ever made.

From 1993 to 1994 he was the host of the game show ''[[Trivial Pursuit (UK game show)|Trivial Pursuit]]''.

Personal problems later overshadowed Slattery's career, leading to a reduced profile. Due to an extended period of illness, he undertook only very occasional television work from the mid-1990s to the early 2000s. He reappeared in ''Red Dwarf'' in 1999 as the voice of a vending machine that threatens [[Arnold Rimmer]] in the final episode of the series, "[[Only the Good...]]".

In January 2005 Slattery appeared in the TV film ''[[Ahead of the Class]]'' with [[Julie Walters]]. In December 2005 he joined the long-running drama ''[[Coronation Street]]'' as [[Eric Talford]] and in April 2006 he appeared in ''[[Grumpy Old Men (TV series)|Grumpy Old Men]]'' on [[BBC Two]]. In 2007 he played Tom O'Driscoll in the feature film 'Lady Godiva Back In The Saddle'. In 2007 he appeared as a regular cast member in the ITV series ''[[Kingdom (2007 TV series)|Kingdom]]'', playing the eccentric Sidney Snell, returning for a third series in 2009.

In 2005 Slattery appeared in series 7 of ''[[Bad Girls (TV series)|Bad Girls]]'', as D.I. Alan Hayes, who was investigating the murder of Jim Fenner. Also in 2005 he won a celebrity edition of the gameshow ''[[The Weakest Link]]'', beating [[Vanessa Feltz]] in the final round. He announced at the end of the show that he would donate his prize money to the [[Terrence Higgins Trust]]. He appeared as well in a cameo role in ITV's ''[[Life Begins (TV series)|Life Begins]]'' as a date for Maggie (played by [[Caroline Quentin]]). In addition, he played the Canon of Birkley in the ''[[Robin Hood (2006 TV series)|Robin Hood]]'' episode "[[Show Me the Money (Robin Hood episode)|Show Me the Money]]" on 17 November 2007. In January 2010 he appeared with [[Phyllida Law]] on ''[[Ready Steady Cook]]''.

In March 2011 Slattery appeared in a reunion special of ''[[Whose Line Is It Anyway? (UK TV series)|Whose Line Is It Anyway?]]'' along with [[David Walliams]], [[Josie Lawrence]], [[Clive Anderson]], [[Humphrey Ker]] and [[Neil Mullarkey]] for the BBC [[Comic Relief]] show ''24-Hour Panel People''.

==Theatre==
In 1981 he teamed with [[Richard Vranch]] as a comedic duo calling themselves "Aftertaste".  For a number of years they toured throughout Great Britain performing in small venues: theatres and clubs, most notably the Tunnel Club, [[King's Head Theatre]] in London and aboard [[the Thekla]], then known as the "Old Profanity Showboat" in [[Bristol]]. Together they hosted the [[Channel 4]] quiz ''The Music Game'' and over 100 episodes of ''Cue the Music'' on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]].

Possessing a [[baritone]] voice, Slattery has appeared on London's [[West End theatre|West End]] stages in the [[musical comedy|musicals]] ''[[Me and My Girl]]'' and ''Radio Times'', as well as in the play ''Neville's Island''.

In May 2006 he was the first voice of the narrator in the 35th anniversary theatre production of [[Richard O'Brien]]'s [[Rocky Horror Show|Rocky Horror Tribute Show]], held at the [[Royal Court Theatre]], just downstairs from the first ever showing of Rocky Horror.

On 20–22 and 24 July 2010, he appeared in [[Ki Longfellow|Ki Longfellow-Stanshall]] and [[Vivian Stanshall]]'s [[Stinkfoot, a Comic Opera|Stinkfoot in Concert]], once again performing aboard ''[[the Thekla]]'' still moored in the [[Bristol]] city docks. (See external links.)

In 2014 Tony appeared in the Oxford Jericho "Name in the Hat" revue alongside [[Kriss Akabusi]].

Slattery returned to improv in November 2017 with the show ''Slattery Night Fever'' at the London Improv Theatre alongside [[Neil Cole]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.londonimprovtheatre.com/slattery-night-fever&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In the mid-1990s, after leaving ''[[Whose Line Is It Anyway? (UK TV series)|Whose Line Is It Anyway?]]'', Slattery suffered what he described as a "[[midlife crisis|mid-life crisis]]" – triggered by excessive drinking and cocaine use (spending up to £4,000 per week on the drug)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Miranda Sawyer |url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2003/jul/06/features.magazine17 |title=Miranda Sawyer meets Tony Slattery |work=The Guardian |date= 6 July 2003|accessdate=3 May 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; – culminating in 1996 with a six-month period as a recluse, during which he did not answer his door or telephone, "or open bills, or wash... I just sat". Eventually, one of his friends broke down the door of his flat and persuaded him to go to hospital. He was diagnosed as suffering from [[bipolar disorder]]. He discussed this period and his subsequent living with the disorder in a documentary made by Stephen Fry, ''[[The Secret Life of the Manic Depressive]]'', in 2006; Slattery claimed that he spent time living in a warehouse and "throwing [his] furniture into the [[Thames]]".

In 1998, he was elected as [[Rector of the University of Dundee]].

He has said "I’m happily described as gay," and has been in a relationship with the actor Mark Michael Hutchinson since 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Dominic Cavendish |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comedy/comedians/tony-slattery-interview-please-dont-write-survivor/ |title=Tony Slattery interview – ‘I had used a lot of myself up, in the wrong way’ |work=The Telegraph|date= 19 July 2017|accessdate=20 July 2017 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
