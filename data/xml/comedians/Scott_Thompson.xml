'''Scott Thompson''' (born June 12, 1959) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] television [[actor]] and [[comedian]], best known for his time as a member of the comedy troupe ''[[The Kids in the Hall]]''.

==Personal life==
Thompson, originally named '''John Scott Thompson''' after his uncle and later changed for the stage, was born in [[North Bay, Ontario]], and grew up in [[Brampton, Ontario|Brampton]]. He is the second oldest of five boys. He attended [[Brampton Centennial Secondary School]] and was a witness of the 1975 [[Centennial Secondary School shooting]].&lt;ref name=shooting&gt;{{citation |title=Just for Laughs venue for new 'shock' material |url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20010721/ctvnews93406/20010721|date=July 21, 2001 |accessdate=2008-09-09 |periodical=[[CTV Television Network]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; He enrolled in [[York University]] but in his third year was asked to leave for being "disruptive". He joined the comedy troupe ''The Love Cats'', where he met [[Mark McKinney]]. Thompson is openly gay.

===Health===
In March 2009, Thompson was diagnosed with [[B-cell]] [[non-Hodgkins lymphoma|non-Hodgkins]] [[gastric lymphoma]]. He completed six rounds of [[chemotherapy]] and one month of radiation and is now cancer-free.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xtra.ca/public/National/Nothing_is_sacred_in_new_Kids_in_the_Hall_series-8055.aspx "Nothing is sacred in new Kids in the Hall series"]. ''[[Xtra!]]'', December 28, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ca.news.yahoo.com/s/capress/100110/entertainment/tv_kids_in_the_hall "Scott Thompson overcomes cancer and career setbacks on road to Kids comeback"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111221244/http://ca.news.yahoo.com/s/capress/100110/entertainment/tv_kids_in_the_hall |date=2010-01-11 }}. ''[[Yahoo! News]]'', January 10, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Firebombing==
In 2000, Thompson was living with then-boyfriend French documentarian Joel Soler in Hollywood. Soler had smuggled footage out of Iraq to make an [[E!|E! News]]-style satiric political documentary comedy, Uncle Saddam, about the strange eccentricities in the home life of [[Saddam Hussein]] and his family which bubbled behind Hussein’s dictatorial façade. Thompson wrote the narration for the movie, which was read by actor [[Wallace Langham]]. Following the movie, Thompson and Soler's home was under surveillance by a terrorist group in West Hollywood, who eventually firebombed the couple on November 1, 2000. Thompson has discussed this incident in interviews with [[Jesse Brown (journalist)|Jesse Brown]] of CANADALAND and fellow Canadian comic [[Elvira Kurt]] as being inspiration for his future show ''The Lowest Show on Earth''. In the interview with Kurt, he says of the attack, "We were sleeping and a group came to our home. They filled our giant garbage cans with gasoline and set them on fire on our front lawn. They had buckets of red paint. They covered the house with it so it dripped off like blood. They put a note in the front hall that said, "In the name of Allah, the merciful and compassionate, burn this Satanic film or you will be dead." They underlined "dead" just in case we weren't freaked out enough."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kurt|first1=Elvira|title=Scott Thompson on how terror helped him to love his gift|url=http://www.dailyxtra.com/canada/arts-and-entertainment/scott-thompson-terror-helped-love-gift-52874|website=DailyXtra|publisher=DailyXtra|accessdate=15 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This, along with many other incidents throughout Thompson's life, including the 1975 [[Centennial Secondary School shooting]] at his Brampton high school, led him to process incidents of terror on micro- and macrocosmic levels through his one-man comedy show ''The Lowest Show on Earth''. Thompson went on tour with this show and secured a spot in New York off-Broadway. The posters—featuring Thompson lying [[Supine position|supine]] on the ground with a big wad of [[semen]] dripping down the side of his face—went up around the city on September 10, 2001. The following day, the horror of [[September 11 attacks|September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center]] made the one-man show’s difficult material completely impossible to talk about.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brown|first1=Jesse|title=Scott Thompson: Veteran comedian Scott Thompson on why nothing happened after The Kids In The Hall, the biggest problems with the Canadian film &amp; TV industry, and why gay men still have to be defanged to be accepted.|url=http://www.canadalandshow.com/podcast/scott-thompson/|website=CANADALAND|publisher=CANADALAND|accessdate=15 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In 1984, he became a member of ''[[The Kids in the Hall]]''. That troupe's series aired starting 1989 on the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] in Canada and on [[HBO]] in the United States, but moved to [[CBS]] for the fourth and fifth seasons. [[Coming out|Openly gay]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Joseph|last=Hanania|date=October 25, 1996|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|title=''Ellen'' Takes Back Seat at Talk on Gays' Role in Hollywood|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-10-25/entertainment/ca-57621_1_gay-community|accessdate=December 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thompson became best-known on the show for his monologues as the "alpha queen" socialite [[Buddy Cole (character)|Buddy Cole]], as well as his appearances as [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]], secretary Cathy, businessman Danny Husk, actress Francesca Fiore, and as the demented old man in the popular "Love and Sausages" sketch.

During the mid-1990s Thompson ran an interactive website, developed by his younger brother Craig and called ScottLand. It had a live-chat area, voting and comedy espionnage and sold Buddy Cole T-shirts and video tapes of comedy sketches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,299167,00.html "An actor's site gag"], ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', October 20, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

He also appeared regularly on ''[[The Larry Sanders Show]]'' as Hank Kingsley's personal assistant Brian, and made numerous guest appearances on other television series, including ''[[Politically Incorrect]]'', ''[[Late Show with David Letterman|The Late Show]]'', ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'', and ''[[Train 48]]''. Thompson hosted a [[reality television]] program in Canada called ''[[My Fabulous Gay Wedding]]''. Thompson defended [[Mordecai Richler]]'s novel ''[[Cocksure]]'' in ''[[Canada Reads|Canada Reads 2006]]''. He has continued to tour, and act in numerous movies and on TV.  He joined the other Kids in the Hall to tour as recently as 2014, guest-starred in two episodes of ''[[Reno 911!]]'', and performed in the project ''[[Death Comes to Town]]'' (2010) with fellow KITH alumni [[Dave Foley]], [[Bruce McCulloch]], [[Mark McKinney]], and [[Kevin McDonald]]. He had a recurring role in the [[NBC]] series ''[[Hannibal (TV series)|Hannibal]]'', playing Jimmy Price, an [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] crime-scene investigator specializing in latent fingerprints. {{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Thompson published a humor book, ''Buddy Babylon: The Autobiography of Buddy Cole'', and a graphic novel, ''The Hollow Planet'', based on characters from ''The Kids in the Hall'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://torontoist.com/2011/03/scott_thompson_goes_straight_with_new_comic "Scott Thompson Goes Straight With New Comic"]. ''[[Torontoist]]'', March 16, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and has written and performed two one-man shows. In 2014, Thompson, in character as Buddy Cole, did a series of reports on ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' as the program's correspondent for the [[2014 Winter Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/02/11/buddy-cole-russia-anti-gay_n_4767587.html?ir=Entertainment "Buddy Cole Learns About Russia's Anti-Gay Laws, Prepares To Visit Sochi For ''The Colbert Report''"], ''[[Huffington Post]]'', February 11, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
