'''Julius "Nipsey" Russell''' (September 15, 1918 – October 2, 2005)&lt;ref&gt;Nipsey J. Russell, born 15 September 1918, died 2 October 2005. Social Security Administration. ''Social Security Death Index'' ([[Death Master File]]).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Census, 1 January 1920, state of Georgia, county of DeKalb, city of Atlanta, enumeration district 180, page 4-A, family 75, Julius Russell, age 1 year 2 months.&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[United States|American]] [[comedian]], [[poet]], and [[dancer]] best known for his appearances as a guest panelist on [[game show]]s from the 1960s through the 1990s, including ''[[Match Game]]'', ''[[Password (game show)|Password]]'', ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'', ''[[To Tell the Truth]]'' and ''[[Pyramid (game show)|Pyramid]]''. His appearances were frequently distinguished in part by the short, humorous poems he would recite during the broadcast. These lyrics became so closely associated with Russell that [[Dick Clark]], [[Bill Cullen]], [[Betty White]], and others regularly referred to him as "the [[poet laureate]] of television." He also had a leading role in the film version of ''[[The Wiz (film)|The Wiz]]'' as the Tin Man. He was also a frequent guest on the [[Dean Martin Celebrity Roast]] series.

==Early life==
Born in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], Russell went to [[Washington High School (Atlanta, Georgia)|Booker T. Washington High School]] in Atlanta and attended the [[University of Cincinnati]] for one semester in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;Gail Fredensborg, Associate Registrar, University of Cincinnati, 9 January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; He served as a [[combat medic|medic]] in the [[United States Army]] during [[World War II]], enlisting as a private on June 27, 1941, and returning from Europe in 1945 as a [[second lieutenant]].&lt;ref&gt;National Archives and Records Administration. ''U.S. World War II Army Enlistment Records, 1938-1946'' [database online]. Provo, Utah: MyFamily.com, Inc., 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Passenger list of the S.S. ''General Harry Taylor'', Port of New York, 13 September 1945, p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt; He got his start in the 1940s as a [[carhop]] at the Atlanta drive-in [[The Varsity]], where he increased the tips he earned by making customers laugh. He was discovered after he began performing in nightclubs in the 1950s. He subsequently made many "party albums," which were essentially compilations of his stand-up routines.

==Early career==
In 1952, Russell joined forces with film comedian [[Mantan Moreland]] for a stage act, replacing Ben Carter as Moreland's dapper [[Comic foil|straight man]]. One of their bits was an old routine that Moreland and Ben Carter had performed in [[vaudeville]] and in [[Charlie Chan]] films. In the "interruption routine" (or "incomplete sentences") Moreland would engage Russell in conversation, only to be interrupted by Russell, who in turn was interrupted by Moreland:

::Moreland: Guess who I saw? I saw old —
::Russell: Is he back again? I thought he was —
::Moreland: He was, but he got out.
::Russell: Is that so?
::Moreland: Yeah, he was over —
::Russell: Is ''that'' so?

Soon the entire conversation was conducted in incomplete sentences, with each man anticipating or contradicting the other. Moreland and Russell's act can be seen in two all-black-cast compilation films, ''Rhythm and Blues Review'' and ''Rock and Roll Revue''; another variation of the "interruption routine", performed by [[Tommy Davidson]] and [[Savion Glover]], was featured in [[Spike Lee]]'s 2000 film ''[[Bamboozled]]''.

A September 1957 appearance on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' led to several guest spots with [[Jack Paar]] on ''The [[Tonight Show]]'' and in 1961 a supporting role as a New York policeman in the sitcom ''[[Car 54, Where Are You?]]''. In 1965 he became a co-host of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''Les Crane Show''. In 1970 he was a co-star on the short run ABC sitcom ''[[Barefoot in the Park (TV series)|Barefoot in the Park]]''. From 1973 through 1976 he appeared regularly on ''[[The Dean Martin Show]]'' and ''[[The Dean Martin Comedy World]]''. Scattered appearances on television series followed, as well as occasional guest-host stints on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' during the [[Johnny Carson]] era. Russell also appeared frequently in Las Vegas; including a series of appearances with [[Sergio Franchi]] at the Frontier Hotel in 1978 and 1979,&lt;ref&gt;Entertainment in Las Vegas. (September 1, 1978). ''[[Seattle Daily Times]],'' [[Seattle, WA]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Entertainment in Las Vegas. (January 14, 1979). ''[[Seattle Daily Times]],'' [[Seattle, WA]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Entertainment in Las Vegas. (May 18, 1979). ''[[Seattle Daily Times]],'' [[Seattle, WA]]&lt;/ref&gt; and with Franchi in 1979 at the Sands Hotel Copa Room.&lt;ref&gt;Entertainment in Las Vegas. (February 15, 1979). ''[[Seattle Daily Times]],'' [[Seattle, WA]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Game shows==
Russell became the first black performer to become a regular panelist on a daily network game show when he joined ABC's ''[[Missing Links (game show)|Missing Links]]'' in 1964. Another ABC show, ''[[Rhyme and Reason]]'', had poetry as a premise:

::Host: [[Conny Van Dyke]] looks like a girl I once ''dated''...
::Russell: And now, all my dreams are strictly X-rated!

::Host: Jack said to Jill when they came down  the ''hill''...
::Russell: We didn't go there for water — I hope you take the pill!

In 1971 he started as a featured panelist on ''To Tell the Truth'', which led to his being hired for ''The Match Game'' when [[Mark Goodson|Goodson-Todman Productions]] revived it two years later. He also served as panelist in 1968 on the syndicated version of ''What's My Line?''. Producer [[Bob Stewart (television producer)|Bob Stewart]] featured him regularly as a panelist on ''[[Pyramid (game show)|Pyramid]]'' throughout its 1970s and 1980s runs. Russell would host two game show pilots: one was ''Star Words'' for Mark Goodson in 1983 and a revival of ''[[Jackpot (game show)|Jackpot]]'' for Bob Stewart in 1984. These pilots were shot for CBS, but neither pilot was picked up by the network.  Russell went on to host two revivals of [[Barry &amp; Enright Productions|Jack Barry and Dan Enright's]] ''Juvenile Jury'' for [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]] from 1983 to 1984, then again for syndication from 1989 to 1991. In 1985, Russell hosted the short-lived 1985 [[National Broadcasting Company|NBC]] game show ''[[Your Number's Up]]'', which was produced by Sande Stewart.

During his appearances on game shows, at some point in the broadcast the host would give the floor to Russell, who would recite a self-penned poem from memory, looking straight into the camera.&lt;ref name="av140615"&gt;{{cite news |first1=Marah |last1=Eakin |first2=John |last2=Teti |first3=Erik |last3=Adams |work=[[The A.V. Club]] |title=Bonus round stars: 9 celebrities who found their greatest fame on game shows |url=http://www.avclub.com/article/bonus-round-stars-9-celebrities-who-found-their-gr-205592 |date=June 16, 2014 |accessdate=June 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These poems from game show appearances are typical of his style and wit:

::What is the secret of eternal youth?
::The answer is easily told;
::All you gotta do if you wanna look young
::Is hang out with people who are old.

::If you ever go out with a schoolteacher,
::You're in for a sensational night;
::She'll make you do it over and over again
::Until you do it ''right''.

::The young people are very different today;
::And there's one sure way to know;
::Kids used to ask where they came from;
::Now they'll tell you where you can go!

::If a baby slept in a water bed,
::It would be pretty grim;
::You wouldn't know if he was wetting the bed,
::Or the bed was wetting him.

::Spanking a child to get him to learn
::Is something I cannot defend,
::How can you knock any sense in his head
::When you're whacking him on the wrong end.

He was a trained dancer, influenced in his youth by [[Jack Wiggins]]. Russell put these talents to use in the 1978 musical ''[[The Wiz (film)|The Wiz]]'' as the Tin Man. He also appeared on the big screen in 1994's adaptation of ''[[Car 54, Where Are You?]]'', reprising his role as Anderson, who had now been promoted from sergeant to captain.

==Later career and death==
During the 1990s Russell gained popularity with a new generation of television viewers as a regular on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]''. Russell would often appear during comedy sketches between scheduled guests and deliver his trademark rhymes.

Russell's final TV appearance was as a panelist on a game show-themed week on the final season of the Tom Bergeron version of ''[[Hollywood Squares]]''.

He died in 2005 at the age of 87 in [[New York City]], after suffering from [[stomach cancer]]. His ashes were scattered in the [[Atlantic Ocean]].
