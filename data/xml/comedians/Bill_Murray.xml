'''William James Murray''' (born September 21, 1950) is an American actor, comedian, and writer. He first gained exposure on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', a series of performances that earned him his first [[Emmy Award]], and later starred in comedy films—including ''[[Meatballs (film)|Meatballs]]'' (1979), ''[[Caddyshack]]'' (1980), ''[[Stripes (film)|Stripes]]'' (1981), ''[[Tootsie]]'' (1982), ''[[Ghostbusters]]'' (1984), ''[[Scrooged]]'' (1988), ''[[Ghostbusters II]]'' (1989), ''[[What About Bob?]]'' (1991), and ''[[Groundhog Day (film)|Groundhog Day]]'' (1993). He also co-directed ''[[Quick Change]]'' (1990).

Murray garnered additional critical acclaim later in his career, starring in ''[[Lost in Translation (film)|Lost in Translation]]'' (2003), which earned him a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Golden Globe]] and a [[BAFTA Award for Best Actor]], as well as an [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]], and for frequently collaborating with director [[Wes Anderson]]. He also received Golden Globe nominations for his roles in ''Ghostbusters'', ''[[Rushmore (film)|Rushmore]]'' (1998), ''[[Hyde Park on Hudson]]'' (2012), ''[[St. Vincent (film)|St. Vincent]]'' (2014), and the [[HBO]] miniseries [[Olive Kitteridge (miniseries)|''Olive Kitteridge'']] (2014), for which he later won his second [[Primetime Emmy]] Award.

Murray received the [[Mark Twain Prize for American Humor]] in 2016.&lt;ref name="MTPAH"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/bill-murray-accepts-his-mark-twain-prize-i-dreaded-this/2016/10/23/1458ce0e-9962-11e6-9980-50913d68eacb_story.html |title=Bill Murray accepts Mark Twain Prize: ‘As much as I dreaded this ... there’s love’ |last1=McGlone |first1=Peggy |last2= |first2= |date=October 23, 2016 |website= |publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]'' |access-date=November 3, 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His comedy is known for its [[deadpan]] delivery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/film/what-to-watch/bill-murray-best-worst-movies/|title=Will Bill Murray ever make another good movie?|last=Bernstein|first=Jonathan|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=October 30, 2015|accessdate=November 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Murray was born on September 21, 1950, in [[Evanston, Illinois]], to Lucille (née Collins), a mail-room clerk, and Edward Joseph Murray II, a lumber salesman. He was raised in [[Wilmette, Illinois]], a northern suburb of Chicago.&lt;ref name="biography"&gt;{{cite news|title=Bill Murray profile|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/24/Bill-Murray.html|publisher=Film Reference|accessdate=November 12, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071227054158/http://www.filmreference.com/film/24/Bill-Murray.html|archivedate=December 27, 2007|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="familytree"&gt;{{cite news|title=Bill Murray Family Tree|url=http://landing.ancestry.com/famoustree/Tree.aspx?name=murray&amp;sourceCode=6865|publisher=[[Ancestry.com]]|accessdate=November 12, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071227060310/http://landing.ancestry.com/famoustree/Tree.aspx?name=murray&amp;sourceCode=6865|archivedate=December 27, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Murray and his eight siblings were raised in a [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[Irish Americans|Irish-American]] family.&lt;ref name="elder"&gt;{{cite news|last=Elder |first=Sean |url=http://www.salon.com/people/bc/2001/02/06/murray/index.html |title=Brilliant Careers: Bill Murray |work=Salon.com |accessdate=November 12, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011090533/http://salon.com/people/bc/2001/02/06/murray/index.html |archivedate=October 11, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Three of his siblings, [[John Murray (actor)|John Murray]], [[Joel Murray]], and [[Brian Doyle-Murray]], are also actors.

As a youth, Murray read children's biographies of American heroes like [[Kit Carson]], [[Wild Bill Hickok]], and [[Davy Crockett]].&lt;ref name=white/&gt; He attended St. Joseph's grade school and [[Loyola Academy]]. During his teen years, he worked as a [[golf caddy]] to fund his education at the Jesuit high school.&lt;ref name=white/&gt;&lt;ref name="cinderella"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murray|first1=Bill|last2=Peper|first2=George|title=Cinderella Story: My Life in Golf|year=1999|publisher=[[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]]|isbn=0-385-49571-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of his sisters had [[polio]] and his mother suffered several miscarriages.&lt;ref name=white/&gt; During his teen years he was the lead singer of a rock band called the Dutch Masters and took part in high school and community theater.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

After graduating, Murray attended [[Regis University]] in [[Denver]], Colorado, taking pre-medical courses. He quickly dropped out, returning to Illinois.&lt;ref name=white/&gt; Decades later, in 2007, Regis awarded him an [[honorary degree|honorary]] Doctor of Humanities degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|  url= http://www.denverpost.com/headlines/ci_6391555| title= Regis University dropout Bill Murray earns stripes with honorary degree|work= [[The Denver Post]]| date= July 17, 2007| accessdate= March 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 21, 1970, his 20th birthday, the police arrested Murray at Chicago's [[O'Hare Airport]] for trying to smuggle {{convert|10|lbs|kg|abbr=on}} of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], which he had allegedly intended to sell.

==Career==

===Second City===
With an invitation from his older brother, [[Brian Doyle-Murray|Brian]], Murray got his start at [[The Second City]] in Chicago, an [[improvisational comedy]] troupe, studying under [[Del Close]].&lt;ref name="chase"&gt;{{cite news|last=Chase|first=Chris|title=Bill Murray, A Black Sheep Now in ''Stripes''|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 3, 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, he moved to New York City and was recruited by [[John Belushi]]&lt;ref name="carr"&gt;{{cite news |last=Carr |first=Jay |title=Bill Murray's Somber Side |work=[[Boston Globe]] |date=November 20, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a featured player on ''[[The National Lampoon Radio Hour]]''.

===''Saturday Night Live''===
In 1975, an [[Off-Broadway]] version of a ''Lampoon'' show led to his first television role as a cast member of the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] variety show ''[[Saturday Night Live with Howard Cosell]]''.  That same season, another variety show titled ''[[Saturday Night Live|NBC's Saturday Night]]'' premiered. Cosell's show lasted just one season, canceled in early 1976. After working in Los Angeles with the "guerrilla video" commune [[TVTV (video collective)|TVTV]] on several projects, Murray rose to prominence in 1976. He officially joined the cast of [[NBC]]'s ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' for the show's second season, following the departure of [[Chevy Chase]].&lt;ref name="The New Yorker 2014-10-21"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/nine-lives-saturday-night-live|title=The Nine Lives of "Saturday Night Live"|last=Crouch|first=Ian|date=October 21, 2014|publisher=[[The New Yorker]]|accessdate=December 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murray was with ''SNL'' for three seasons from 1977 to 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name| id= 0000195 |name= Bill Murray}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''[[Rutland Weekend Television]]'' sketch [[Eric Idle]] brought for his appearance on ''SNL'' developed into the 1978 [[mockumentary]] ''[[All You Need Is Cash]]'' with Murray (alongside other ''SNL'' cast members) appearing as "Bill Murray the K", a send-up of New York radio host [[Murray the K]], in a segment of the film that is a parody of the [[Albert and David Maysles|Maysles Brothers]]'s documentary ''[[The Beatles: The First U.S. Visit]]''. During the first few seasons of ''SNL'', Murray engaged in a romantic relationship with fellow cast member [[Gilda Radner]].&lt;ref name="something"&gt;{{cite book| last=Radner |first=Gilda |authorlink= Gilda Radner | title= It's Always Something |location= New York |publisher= Simon &amp; Schuster |year= 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film career===
[[File:BillMurraySept10TIFF.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Murray at the [[2010 Toronto International Film Festival]]]]
Murray landed his first starring role with the film ''[[Meatballs (film)|Meatballs]]'' in 1979. He followed this up with his portrayal of [[Hunter S. Thompson]] in 1980's ''[[Where the Buffalo Roam]]''. In the early 1980s, he starred in a string of box-office hits, including ''[[Caddyshack]]'', ''[[Stripes (film)|Stripes]]'', and ''[[Tootsie]]''. Murray was the first guest on NBC's ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'' on February 1, 1982. He later appeared on the first episode of the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' on August 30, 1993, when the show moved to CBS. On January 31, 2012 – 30 years after his first appearance with Letterman – Murray appeared again on his talk show. He appeared as Letterman's final guest when the host retired on May 20, 2015.&lt;ref name=finalguest&gt;{{cite news|first=James|last=Hibberd |url=http://time.com/3860153/david-letterman-bill-murray/ |title= David Letterman’s Final Guest Is Bill Murray| work=[[Time (magazine)|TIME]] |date= May 15, 2015|accessdate=May 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Murray began work on a [[The Razor's Edge (1984 film)|film adaptation]] of the novel ''[[The Razor's Edge]]''. The film, which Murray co-wrote, was his first starring role in a [[dramatic film]]. He later agreed with [[Columbia Pictures]] to star in ''[[Ghostbusters]]''—in a role originally written for [[John Belushi]]—to get financing for ''The Razor's Edge''.&lt;ref name=ready&gt;{{cite web|first= Dan |last= Fierman |url= https://www.gq.com/entertainment/celebrities/201008/bill-murray-dan-fierman-gq-interview |title= Bill Murray Is Ready To See You Now| work=[[GQ]] |date= August 2010|accessdate=July 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ghostbusters'' became the highest-grossing film of 1984 and the highest-grossing comedy of all-time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Ghostbusters' Tops Comedies|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=January 16, 1985|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Razor's Edge'', which was filmed before ''Ghostbusters'' but not released until after, was a box-office flop.

Upset over the failure of ''The Razor's Edge'', Murray took four years off from acting to study philosophy and history at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]], frequent the [[Cinémathèque Française|Cinémathèque]] in Paris, and spend time with his family in their [[Hudson River Valley]] home.&lt;ref name="carr"/&gt; During that time, his second son, Luke, was born.&lt;ref name="white"/&gt; With the exception of a [[cameo appearance]] in the 1986 movie ''[[Little Shop of Horrors (film)|Little Shop of Horrors]]'', he did not make any appearances in films, though he did participate in several public readings in [[Manhattan]] organized by playwright/director Timothy Mayer and in a stage production of [[Bertolt Brecht]]'s ''[[Man Equals Man|A Man's a Man]]''.&lt;ref name="white"/&gt;

Murray returned to films with ''[[Scrooged]]'' in 1988 and ''[[Ghostbusters II]]'' in 1989. In 1990, Murray made his first and only attempt at directing when he co-directed ''[[Quick Change]]'' with producer [[Howard Franklin]]. His subsequent films ''[[What About Bob?]]'' (1991) and ''[[Groundhog Day (film)|Groundhog Day]]'' (1993) were box-office hits. After ''[[Groundhog Day (film)|Groundhog Day]]'', he appeared in a series of well-received supporting roles in films like ''[[Ed Wood (film)|Ed Wood]]'', ''[[Kingpin (1996 film)|Kingpin]]'', and ''[[Space Jam]]'' (where he appeared as himself). However, his starring roles in ''[[Larger than Life (film)|Larger than Life]]'' and ''[[The Man Who Knew Too Little]]'' were not as successful with critics or audiences. In 1998, he received much critical acclaim for [[Wes Anderson]]'s ''[[Rushmore (film)|Rushmore]]'', for which he won Best Supporting Actor awards from the [[New York Film Critics Circle]], the [[National Society of Film Critics]], and the [[Los Angeles Film Critics Association]] (tying with [[Billy Bob Thornton]]). Murray decided to take a turn towards more dramatic roles and experienced a resurgence in his career, taking on roles in ''[[Wild Things (film)|Wild Things]]'', ''[[Cradle Will Rock]]'', ''[[Hamlet (2000 movie)|Hamlet]]'' (as [[Polonius]]), and ''[[The Royal Tenenbaums]]''. In 2003, he appeared in [[Sofia Coppola]]'s ''[[Lost in Translation (film)|Lost in Translation]]'' and went on to earn a [[Golden Globe Award]], a [[BAFTA Award]], and an [[Independent Spirit Award]], as well as Best Actor awards from several film critic organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/film/awards/2003/awardsandnominations.shtml |title=2003 Film Awards &amp; Nominations |publisher=Metacritic |accessdate=November 10, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502193917/http://www.metacritic.com/film/awards/2003/awardsandnominations.shtml |archivedate=May 2, 2008 |deadurl=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was considered a favorite to win the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]], but [[Sean Penn]] ultimately won the award for his performance in ''[[Mystic River (film)|Mystic River]]''. In an interview included on the ''Lost in Translation'' DVD, Murray states that it is his favorite movie in which he has appeared. Also in 2003, he appeared in a short cameo for [[Jim Jarmusch]]'s ''[[Coffee and Cigarettes]]'', in which he played himself "hiding out" in a local coffee shop.

During this time Murray still appeared in comedic roles such as ''[[Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle|Charlie's Angels]]'' and ''[[Osmosis Jones]]''. In 2004, he provided the voice of [[Garfield]] in ''[[Garfield: The Movie]]'', and again in 2006 for ''[[Garfield: A Tail of Two Kitties]]''. Murray later said that he only took the role because he was under the mistaken impression the screenplay, co-written by [[Joel Cohen (writer)|Joel Cohen]], was the work of [[Coen Brothers|Joel Coen]].&lt;ref name="gq"&gt;{{cite news | title = Bill Murray Is Ready To See You Now | date = August 2010 | url = https://www.gq.com/entertainment/celebrities/201008/bill-murray-dan-fierman-gq-interview?printable=true | work = GQ | accessdate = March 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2004, he made his third collaboration with Wes Anderson in ''[[The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou]]'' and in 2005 his second collaboration with [[Jim Jarmusch]] in ''[[Broken Flowers]]''. That same year, Murray announced that he was taking a break from acting&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000195/bio| title= Bill Murray biography page |publisher= Internet Movie Database|accessdate=January 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; as he had not had the time to relax since his new breakthrough in the late 1990s. He did return to the big screen for brief cameos in Wes Anderson's ''[[The Darjeeling Limited]]'' and in ''[[Get Smart (film)|Get Smart]]'' as Agent 13, the agent in the tree. In 2008, he played an important role in the [[post-apocalyptic]] film ''[[City of Ember]]'', and in 2009, played himself in a [[cameo appearance|cameo]] role in the [[zombie comedy]] ''[[Zombieland]]''.

Murray provided the voice for the character Mr. Badger in the 2009 animated film ''[[Fantastic Mr. Fox (film)|Fantastic Mr. Fox]]''.

Since 2010, Murray has been part of ensembles which received several award nominations in two Wes Anderson movies: ''[[Moonrise Kingdom]]'' (2012) and ''[[Grand Budapest Hotel]]'' (2014). Murray was nominated for a Golden Globe for his performance in the 2014 film ''[[St. Vincent (film)|St. Vincent]]''. He played a music manager in 2015’s ''[[Rock the Kasbah (film)|Rock the Kasbah]]''. In 2016, he was the voice of [[Baloo]] in Disney's live action remake of ''[[The Jungle Book (2016 film)|The Jungle Book]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Bill-Murray-Sing-Jungle-Book-Best-Song-68764.html|title=Bill Murray Will Sing The Jungle Book's Best Song |date=December 19, 2014|work=cinemablend.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film earned a 95% approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_jungle_book_2016/ | title=The Jungle Book (2016) | website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | accessdate=December 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Murray was nominated to for Favorite Animated Movie Voice at the People’s Choice Awards; he lost to [[Ellen DeGeneres]].

Murray appeared as Martin Heiss, a skeptical ghost debunker, in the [[reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of ''[[Ghostbusters (2016 film)|Ghostbusters]]'', which was released on July 15, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2015/08/09/bill-murray-new-ghostbusters-movie/31378093/ | title=Bill Murray to appear in new 'Ghostbusters' | work=USA Today | date=August 9, 2015 | accessdate=August 9, 2015 | author=Truitt, Brian}}&lt;/ref&gt; There had been speculation that he might return to the [[Ghostbusters (franchise)|''Ghostbusters'' franchise]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/38625/round-and-round-we-go-more-from-bill-murray-ghostbusters-3|title=Round and Round We Go – More From Bill Murray on Ghostbusters 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a rumored ''[[Ghostbusters 3]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/20949|title=Fans Convince Murray to Do Third 'Ghostbusters'?}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he dispelled such rumors in an interview with ''[[GQ]]''. In March 2010, Murray appeared on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' and talked about his return to ''Ghostbusters III'', stating "I'd do it only if my character was killed off in the first reel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/topnews.php?id=14322 |title=Bill Murray Talks Ghostbusters 3 on Letterman |work=ShockTilYouDrop |publisher=CraveOnline |date=March 1, 2010 |accessdate=March 22, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100406154834/http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/topnews.php?id=14322 |archivedate=April 6, 2010 |deadurl=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with ''GQ'', Murray said: "You know, maybe I should just do it. Maybe it'd be fun to do." In the interview, when asked "Is the third ''Ghostbusters'' movie happening? What's the story with that?", Murray replied, "It's all a bunch of crock."&lt;ref name=ready/&gt;

He was part of the ensemble cast of the 2018 animated film ''[[Isle of Dogs (film)|Isle of Dogs]]'', by [[Wes Anderson]], which premiered at the [[68th Berlin International Film Festival]].

In the book ''Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live, as Told By Its Stars, Writers and Guests'', [[Chevy Chase]] recalls being confronted by Murray shortly before an ''SNL'' broadcast in which Chase had returned to guest host. The issue, likely to do with Chase's insistence on doing the "Weekend Update" segment that had been taken over by [[Jane Curtin]], led to Murray and Chase trading insults, with Murray telling Chase to go have sex with Jacqueline Carlin, Chase's wife at the time, while Chase commented that Murray's face looked "like something [[Neil Armstrong]] had landed on”.

Murray has said in interviews that he did not get along with film director [[Richard Donner]] while filming ''[[Scrooged]]'', stating that they would disagree with each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ebert|first=Roger|title=BILL MURRAY, "QUICK CHANGE" ARTIST|date=July 13, 1990|publisher=''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]''|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/interviews/bill-murray-quick-change-artist|accessdate=July 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=entertainment/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mullins|first=Jenna|title=NEWS/ 56 Facts You May Not Know About Your Favorite Holiday Films|date=December 18, 2014|publisher=''[[E!

Both Murray and [[Richard Dreyfuss]] have confirmed in separate interviews that they did not get along with each other during the making of ''[[What About Bob?]]''.&lt;ref name=entertainment&gt;{{cite web|last=Meyers|first=Kate|title=A Bill Murray filmography|date=March 19, 1993|publisher=''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''|url=http://www.ew.com/article/1993/03/19/bill-murray-filmography|accessdate=May 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rabin|first=Nathan|title=Richard Dreyfuss|date=October 8, 2009|publisher=''[[The A.V.

Murray also had a falling out with film director and longtime collaborator [[Harold Ramis]] during the production of ''[[Groundhog Day (film)|Groundhog Day]]''.  According to screenwriter [[Danny Rubin]], "They were like two brothers who weren’t getting along."  As a result, ''Groundhog Day'' ultimately served as the final film collaboration between Murray and Ramis.  Murray eventually reconciled with Ramis just before Ramis's death in February 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wakeman|first=Gregory|title=How Groundhog Day Ruined Bill Murray And Harold Ramis’ Partnership|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/new/How-Groundhog-Day-Ruined-Bill-Murray-Harold-Ramis-Partnership-67345.html|accessdate=May 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Friend | first=Tad | url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2004/04/19/040419fa_fact3?currentPage=7 | title=Annals of Hollywood: Comedy First | publisher=The New Yorker | date=January 7, 2009 | accessdate=May 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Heisler | first=Steve | url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/harold-ramis,29410/ | title=Harold Ramis &amp;#124; Film | publisher=A.V.

During the making of ''[[Charlie's Angels (2000 film)|Charlie's Angels]]'', [[Lucy Liu]] allegedly threw punches at Murray after he told her that she could not act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Famous co-stars who absolutely hated each other|date=November 4, 2014|publisher=[[News.com.au]]|url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/movies/famous-costars-who-absolutely-hated-each-other/story-e6frfmvr-1227112569514|accessdate=May 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Murray claims that he and Liu only had an argument rather than a feud and that they have "made peace" since then.&lt;ref name=cm&gt;{{cite web|last=Williams|first=Steven|title=Bill Murray Explains That His Feud With Lucy Liu Never Even Occurred|date=September 11, 2003|publisher=[[Contactmusic.com]]|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/bill-murray/news/bill-clears-up-charlie.s-angels-feud-with-lucy|accessdate=May 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Murray has also denied a claim that he head-butted [[McG]], the director of the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nashawaty|first=Chris|title=Bill Murray says 'Charlie's Angels' director 'deserves to die'|date=October 20, 2009|publisher=''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2009/10/20/bill-murray-says-charlies-angels-director-deserves-to-die|accessdate=May 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Lost in Translation (film)|Lost in Translation]]'' director [[Sofia Coppola]] said that the central scene of [[Scarlett Johansson]] and Murray lying on the bed together took multiple takes because the actors did not seem to be getting along. She eventually stopped for the day and started again the next morning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stern|first=Marlow|title=Sofia Coppola Discusses ‘Lost in Translation’ on Its 10th Anniversary|date=September 12, 2013|publisher=''[[The Daily Beast]]''|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/sofia-coppola-discusses-lost-in-translation-on-its-10th-anniversary|accessdate=June 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
