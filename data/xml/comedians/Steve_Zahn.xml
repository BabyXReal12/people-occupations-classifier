Zahn attended [[Gustavus Adolphus College]] for one semester but dropped out after seeing the original [[West End production]] of ''[[Les Misérables (musical)|Les Misérables]]''. "I remember sitting through the second act thinking, I’m good as that guy standing on the barricade," Zahn recalled. "I wanted to be part of the circus."&lt;ref name="riesman"&gt;Riesman, Abraham (July 13, 2017).

After his breakout film role in 1994's ''[[Reality Bites]]'', Zahn quickly gained a reputation for playing amiable stoners, slackers, and sidekicks in films such as ''[[That Thing You Do!]]'' (1996), ''[[You've Got Mail]]'' (1998), and ''[[Out of Sight]]'' (1998).&lt;ref name="random"&gt;Rabin, Nathan (July 3, 2007).

Retrieved September 15, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, Zahn was often approached by fans who assumed that he was an archetypal [[Generation X]] slacker, which was not the case. He has said, "I’m the guy who gets up at six without an alarm clock. I was always that guy."&lt;ref name="riesman"/&gt;

In 1999, Zahn landed his first starring role in the critically acclaimed [[independent film|indie]] film ''[[Happy, Texas (film)|Happy, Texas]]'', for which he won a [[List of Sundance Film Festival award winners|Special Jury Award]] at the [[Sundance Film Festival]].&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;Ojumu, Akin (November 13, 1999).

Retrieved September 15, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of ''Happy, Texas'', Zahn began playing darker, more nuanced characters. He received [[Academy Award|Oscar]] buzz for his role as [[Drew Barrymore]]'s deadbeat ex in ''[[Riding in Cars with Boys]]'' (2001), and played the investigative journalist [[Adam Penenberg]] in ''[[Shattered Glass (film)|Shattered Glass]]'' (2003).&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Neil (December 4, 2001).

Martin]] in Herzog's 2007 film ''[[Rescue Dawn]]''; to prepare for the role, he lost 40 pounds by eating mostly raw food.&lt;ref name="random"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kentucky"/&gt;

Zahn has also worked regularly in television, playing the role of Davis McClary on 36 episodes of [[HBO]]'s ''[[Treme (TV series)|Treme]]''.

In 2017, Zahn played Bad Ape in ''[[War for the Planet of the Apes]]''. He researched the role by watching chimp videos on YouTube, and later said that the [[motion capture]] process and lengthy [[Digital cinematography|digital]] takes made Bad Ape "the most challenging acting job I’ve ever had".&lt;ref&gt;Rottenberg, Josh (April 21, 2017).
