'''Lyda Roberti''' (née '''Pecjak'''; May 20, 1906 – March 12, 1938) was an American stage and film actress, and singer.

==Life and career==
Born in [[Warsaw]], then part of [[Imperial Russia]], Lyda Roberti was the daughter of a German father (surnamed Pecjak), a professional clown, {{citation needed|date=September 2017}} and a Polish mother. As a child she performed in the [[circus]] as a [[trapeze]] artist, and was a [[vaudeville]] singer.

As her family toured Europe and Asia, Roberti's mother left her husband. To escape the upheaval in Russia after the Communist revolution in 1917, they settled in [[Shanghai, China]], where Lyda earned money singing. She had an elder brother, also born in Poland, [http://search.ancestrylibrary.com/cgi-bin/sse.dll?_phsrc=fPn9&amp;_phstart=successSource&amp;usePUBJs=true&amp;gss=angs-g&amp;new=1&amp;rank=1&amp;gsfn=Manya%20&amp;gsfn_x=0&amp;gsln=Schneider&amp;gsln_x=0&amp;msbdy_x=1&amp;msbdp=2&amp;msbdy=1908&amp;catbucket=rstp&amp;MSAV=0&amp;uidh=57k&amp;pcat=ROOT_CATEGORY&amp;h=55319678&amp;recoff=12%2013&amp;dbid=3693&amp;indiv=1&amp;ml_rpos=2 Robert Pecjak (later Robert Roberti; 1905-1996)]. Lyda and Robert's [[Kiev]]-born younger sister, Mary Pecjak, was briefly an actress, known as Manya Roberti (1908-1983),&lt;ref&gt;[http://death-records.mooseroots.com/l/105661552/Manya-Schneider Manya Schneider profile], death-records.mooseroots.com; accessed September 30, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; who later disappeared from show business.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0730740/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm Manya Roberti profile], imdb.com; accessed March 30, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Manya Pecjak (aka Roberti) married an American, Irvin Russell Deibert (1899-1937), on November 8, 1924, aged 16, in [[Shanghai|Shanghai, China]]; the couple had a daughter, Lorraine Roberta, later Mrs. Bass (1926–1996). They divorced {{When|date=October 2017}}, and, in 1933, Manya Deibert later remarried, to Louis Schneider. It is not known if any children resulted from this union.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ancestrylibrary.com/interactive/1652/32180_520307095_0005-00584?pid=12247&amp;backurl=http://search.ancestrylibrary.com/cgi-bin/sse.dll?_phsrc%3DBrT12%26_phstart%3DsuccessSource%26usePUBJs%3Dtrue%26gss%3Dangs-g%26new%3D1%26rank%3D1%26msT%3D1%26gsfn%3DRussell%26gsfn_x%3D0%26gsln%3DDeibert%26gsln_x%3D0%26msgdy%3D1924%26msgpn__ftp%3DShanghai,%2520China%26msgpn%3D30166%26msgpn_PInfo%3D5-%257C0%257C1652396%257C0%257C5057%257C0%257C30166%257C0%257C0%257C0%257C0%257C0%257C%26catbucket%3Drstp%26MSAV%3D1%26uidh%3D57k%26pcat%3DROOT_CATEGORY%26h%3D12247%26recoff%3D11%252012%26dbid%3D1652%26indiv%3D1%26ml_rpos%3D1&amp;treeid=&amp;personid=&amp;hintid=&amp;usePUB=true&amp;_phsrc=BrT12&amp;_phstart=successSource&amp;usePUBJs=true Manya Roberti biodata], ancestrylibrary.com; accessed September 28, 2017.{{paywall}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lyda made her [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] debut in ''[[You Said It]]'' in 1931, and with its success became an overnight sensation. During her run with the show, she was nicknamed "Broadway's preferred Polish blonde". Historian Edward Jablonski found that "much of her appeal to the audiences at the time was due to her Polish accent" and cited instances where her pronunciation of certain consonants would "stir audiences to gales of laughter."&lt;ref name="Jablonski1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Edward Jablonski|title=Harold Arlen: Rhythm, Rainbows, and Blues|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XsgCHeS69q8C&amp;pg=PA63|date=September 1, 1998|publisher=UPNE|isbn=978-1-55553-366-3|pages=63–}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also appeared in the short-lived Gershwin musical ''[[Pardon My English]]'' in 1933. She moved to [[Hollywood]] and during the 1930s played in a string of films. Her sexy but playful characterisations, along with the unusual accent she had acquired during her years in Europe and Asia, made her popular with audiences.

She starred in [[Edward F. Cline]]'s comedy ''[[Million Dollar Legs (1932 film)|Million Dollar Legs]]'' (1932) as "Mata Machree, The Woman No Man Can Resist", a [[Mata Hari]]-based spy character who is hired to undermine the President of Klopstokia (played by [[W. C. Fields]]) in his efforts to secure money for his destitute country. Her plan is to seduce the athletes that Klopstokia is sending to the [[Olympic Games]], and thereby prevent them from medaling. Highlights of the film include Mata Machree's steamy rendition of "When I Get Hot in Klopstokia", and the dance she performs to inspire Fields's opponent in the weightlifting competition.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

In the film version of ''[[Roberta (1935 film)|Roberta]]'', [[Ginger Rogers]] played the role that Roberti had originated on Broadway. Roberti had replaced [[Thelma Todd]] in a couple of films after Todd's death, but Roberti's own health was failing due to [[heart disease]]. She began to work less frequently although two days before her death she performed a radio show with [[Al Jolson]]. {{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

==Personal life==
On June 25, 1935, Lyda Roberti married aviator Bud Ernst in [[Yuma, Arizona]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lyda Roberti Weds Aviator At Yuma, Ariz.|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/8963057/reading_times/|work=Reading Times|agency=Associated Press|date=June 26, 1935|location=Pennsylvania, Reading|page=9|via=Newspapers.com|accessdate=February 15, 2017}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
According to her friend and co-star [[Patsy Kelly]], Roberti died suddenly at age 31 from a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] while bending to tie her shoelace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crivello|first=Kirk|title=Fallen Angels: The Lives and Untimely Deaths of Fourteen Hollywood Beauties|publisher=Citadel Press|year=1988|isbn=0-8065-1096-X|page=270}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of her death, she was still married to Ernst. She is interred in the [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale)|Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery]] in [[Glendale, California]].
