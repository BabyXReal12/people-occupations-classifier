'''Dick Shawn''' (born '''Richard Schulefand''', December 1, 1923 – April 17, 1987) was an American [[actor]] and [[comedian]].  He played a wide variety of [[supporting role]]s and was a prolific [[character actor]].  He was well known during the 1960s for small but iconic roles in madcap comedies, usually portraying caricatures of [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counter culture]] personalities, such as the deadbeat son Sylvester in ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' and the [[hippie]] actor "L.S.D."  in ''[[The Producers (1968 film)|The Producers]]'' (1968).

==Early life and career==
Shawn was born in [[Buffalo, New York]], and raised in adjacent [[Lackawanna, New York|Lackawanna]]. The best remembered roles of his career are the hot-headed Sylvester Marcus, son of Mrs. Marcus ([[Ethel Merman]]), in [[Stanley Kramer]]'s ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' (1963) and easygoing Lorenzo St. DuBois/[[Adolf Hitler]] in the musical ''Springtime for Hitler'', the play within [[Mel Brooks]]'s movie ''[[The Producers (1968 film)|The Producers]]'' (1968). He also provided the [[Snow Miser]]'s voice in ''[[The Year Without a Santa Claus]]'' (1974).

He had continued success with his stand-up comedy act that he successfully performed for over 35 years in nightclubs around the world. His award-winning one-man stage show, ''The Second Greatest Entertainer in the Whole Wide World'', was sometimes performed with a unique opening. When the audience entered the theater, they saw a bare stage with a pile of bricks in stage center. When the play began, Shawn emerged from the pile of bricks. The startling effect of this required complete concentration and breath control because the slightest movement of the bricks could ruin the surprise appearance.

In addition to roles in more than 30 movies and seven Broadway productions, Shawn made numerous television appearances, toured often, and periodically performed a one-man show that mixed songs, sketches, and pantomime. He was a frequent speaker at the infamous Friars Club Roasts in [[Friars Club of Beverly Hills|Los Angeles]] and [[New York Friars Club|New York]]. At one of the X-rated roasts (a 1986 ''[[Playboy]]'' roast of [[Tommy Chong]]) that had overdosed on tasteless routines by previous speakers, Shawn walked up to the microphone, took a long pause, and "vomited" pea soup onto himself and other speakers at the dais.

His many TV appearances included ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', TV movies, sitcoms (including ''[[Three's Company]]'' on which he played [[Jack Tripper]]'s father), dramas including ''[[St. Elsewhere]]'' and ''[[Magnum, P.I.]]'', and a music video for [[Dance (Ratt song)|"Dance"]] by the hair metal band [[Ratt]] (1986). Among his roles in anthology TV series, he starred in an ''[[Amazing Stories (TV series)|Amazing Stories]]'' episode "Miss Stardust", directed by [[Tobe Hooper]], about a bizarre intergalactic [[beauty pageant]],&lt;ref&gt;Amazing Stories: Miss Stardust https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0511106/&lt;/ref&gt; and played the Emperor in ''[[The Emperor's New Clothes]]'' in [[Shelley Duvall]]'s ''[[Faerie Tale Theatre]]''. He filled in for vacationing [[Johnny Carson]] as guest host on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' on January 1, 1971, which saw the last cigarette commercial on American television (for [[Virginia Slims]]) aired on TV, one minute before the cigarette ads were banned.

==Personal life==
Shawn was married to Rita Bachner in 1946, and they had four children: Amy, Wendy (married to [[John Travolta]]'s older brother [[Joey Travolta]]), Adam, and Jennifer. He had one grandchild, Rachel Travolta. He was a longtime resident of [[Englewood, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Dan. [https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/baltsun/access/1752125652.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Nov+28%2C+1971&amp;author=&amp;pub=The+Sun+(1837-1985)&amp;desc=Dick+Shawn%3A+Mixed-Media+Man&amp;pqatl=google "Dick Shawn: Mixed-Media Man"], ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'', November 28, 1971. Accessed February 17, 2011. "DICK SHAWN left the comforts of his 14-room home in Englewood, NJ, one recent Sunday and flew to Hollywood to start work on a movie for television."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
On April 17, 1987, during a performance at [[University of California, San Diego]]'s Mandeville Hall—which included his portrayal of a politician reciting such campaign clichés as "If elected, I will not lay down on the job"—Shawn suffered a fatal [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] and collapsed face-down on the stage.  The audience initially assumed that it was part of his act; but after he had remained motionless on the stage for several minutes, a stage hand examined him and asked if a physician was present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=SCOTT |first1=JANNY |last2=JR |first2=TED THACKREY |title=Comedian Dick Shawn, 63, Is Stricken on Stage, Dies |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-04-19/news/mn-1888_1_audience |accessdate=27 June 2018 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=19 April 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[CPR]] had been initiated, the audience was asked to leave the auditorium, but most remained, still assuming that it was all part of Shawn's act. Many began leaving—still unsure of what they had witnessed—only after paramedics arrived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-04-18/local/me-1079_1_dick-shawn|title=Comedian Dick Shawn, 57, Is Stricken on Stage, Dies|publisher=''[[Los Angeles Times]]''|date=April 18, 1987|accessdate=March 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A notice in the following day's ''[[San Diego Union-Tribune|San Diego Union]]'' newspaper clarified that Shawn had indeed died during the performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= | title=Dick Shawn | url=http://www.answers.com/topic/dick-shawn | work=Actors Biographies | publisher=All Media Guide | year=2009 | accessdate=2009-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dick Shawn was 63. He is interred at [[Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery]], a [[Jews|Jewish]] cemetery, in [[Culver City, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= | title=Dick Shawn | url=http://blog.marshotelonline.com/cemetery-visits/things-to-do-in-la-when-youre-dead-part-2/#shawn | work=Josh Pincus is Crying | publisher=Things to do in L.A.
