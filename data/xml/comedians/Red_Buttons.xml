'''Red Buttons''' (born '''Aaron Chwatt'''; February 5, 1919 &amp;ndash; July 13, 2006) was an [[Americans|American]] actor and comedian. He won an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Oscar]] and a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture|Golden Globe]] for his supporting role in the 1957 film ''[[Sayonara]]''.

==Early life==
Red Buttons was born Aaron Chwatt&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; on February 5, 1919, in New York City, to [[Jews|Jewish]] immigrants Sophie (née Baker) and Michael Chwatt.&lt;ref name="judaicaref"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title =Motion Pictures| encyclopedia =Encyclopaedia Judaica| volume=| pages =| publisher =Keter Publishing House| date =1971–1972| id =| accessdate =2006-11-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/55/Red-Buttons.html|title=Red Buttons Biography (1919-)|author=|date=|website=www.filmreference.com|accessdate=4 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180221100532/http://www.filmreference.com/film/55/Red-Buttons.html|archivedate=21 February 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At sixteen years old, Chwatt got a job as an entertaining [[bellhop]] at Ryan's Tavern in [[City Island, Bronx]]. The combination of his red hair and the large, shiny buttons on the bellhop uniforms inspired orchestra leader Charles "Dinty" Moore to call him "Red Buttons," the name under which he would later perform.

Later that same summer Buttons worked on the [[Borscht Belt]];&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; his [[double act|straight man]] was [[Robert Alda]]. Buttons was working at the Irvington Hotel in South Fallsburg, New York, when the Master of Ceremonies became incapacitated, and he asked for the chance to replace him. In 1939 Buttons started working for [[Minsky's Burlesque]]; in 1941, [[José Ferrer]] chose Buttons to appear in a [[Broadway theater|Broadway show]] ''The Admiral Had a Wife''. The show was a [[farce]] set in [[Pearl Harbor]], and it was due to open on December 8, 1941. It never did, as it was deemed inappropriate after the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Japanese attack]]. In later years Buttons would joke that the Japanese only attacked Pearl Harbor to keep him off Broadway.

==Career==
In September 1942 Buttons made his Broadway debut in ''Vickie'' with Ferrer and [[Uta Hagen]]. Later that year he appeared in the Minsky's show ''Wine, Women and Song.'' This was the last classic [[American burlesque|Burlesque]] show in New York City history, as the Mayor [[Fiorello H. LaGuardia|La Guardia]] administration closed it down. Buttons was on stage when the show was raided.

Drafted into the [[United States Army Air Forces]], Buttons in 1943 appeared in the Army Air Forces' Broadway show ''[[Winged Victory (play)|Winged Victory]]'', along with several future stars, including [[Mario Lanza]], [[John Forsythe]], [[Karl Malden]] and [[Lee J. Cobb]]. A year later he appeared in [[Darryl F. Zanuck]]'s movie version of ''[[Winged Victory (film)|Winged Victory]]'', directed by [[George Cukor]]. Buttons also entertained troops in the [[European Theatre of World War II|European Theater]] in the same [[Jeep Show]] unit as [[Mickey Rooney]].

After the war Buttons continued to do Broadway shows. He also performed at Broadway movie houses with [[big band]]s. In 1952, Buttons received his own variety series on television, ''The Red Buttons Show'', which ran for three years on [[CBS]].  It was the #11 show in prime time in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.classictvhits.com/tvratings/1952.htm|title=ClassicTVHits.com: TV Ratings &gt; 1950's|author=|date=|website=www.classictvhits.com|accessdate=4 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171008121134/http://www.classictvhits.com/tvratings/1952.htm|archivedate=8 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953 he recorded and had a two-sided hit with ''Strange Things Are Happening/The Ho Ho Song'', with both sides/songs essentially being the same.

His role in ''[[Sayonara]]'' was a dramatic departure from his previous work. In this film, co-starring with [[Marlon Brando]], he played Joe Kelly, an [[United States Air Force|American airman]] stationed in [[Kobe]], Japan during the [[Korean War]], who marries Katsumi, a Japanese woman (played by [[Miyoshi Umeki]]), but is barred from taking her back to the United States. His moving portrayal of Kelly's calm resolve not to abandon the relationship, and the touching reassurance of Katsumi, impressed audiences and critics alike.  Buttons won the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] and Umeki won the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for the film.

[[File:Red Buttons Double Life of Henry Phyfe 1965.JPG|thumb|180px|Buttons as Henry Phyfe]]
After his Oscar-winning role Buttons performed in numerous feature films, including the Africa adventure ''[[Hatari!]]'' with [[John Wayne]], the adventure ''[[Five Weeks in a Balloon (film)|Five Weeks in a Balloon]]'' (1962) (where he received top billing), the war epic ''[[The Longest Day (film)|The Longest Day]]'', the biopic ''[[Harlow (Paramount film)|Harlow]]'', the disaster film ''[[The Poseidon Adventure (1972 film)|The Poseidon Adventure]]'', the dance-marathon drama ''[[They Shoot Horses, Don't They? (film)|They Shoot Horses, Don't They?]]'', the family comedy ''[[Pete's Dragon]]'', the disaster film ''[[When Time Ran Out]]'' with [[Paul Newman]] and the age-reversal comedy ''[[18 Again!]]'' with [[George Burns]].

In 1966 Buttons again starred in his own TV series, a spy spoof called ''[[The Double Life of Henry Phyfe]]'', which ran for one season. Buttons also made memorable guest appearances on several TV programs including ''[[The Eleventh Hour (1962 TV series)|The Eleventh Hour]]'', ''[[Little House on the Prairie (TV series)|Little House on the Prairie]]'', ''[[It's Garry Shandling's Show]]'', ''[[Knots Landing]]'' and ''[[Roseanne (TV series)|Roseanne]]''.  His last TV role was in ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]''.

He became a nationally recognisable comedian, and his "Never Got A Dinner" routine was a standard of ''[[The Dean Martin Celebrity Roast]]'' for many years. He was number 71 on [[Comedy Central]]'s list of the ''100 Greatest Stand-Ups of All Time''.

Another of his catchphrases was "I did not come here to be made sport of," which has been taken up recently by radio talk show host [[Howie Carr]].

Buttons received a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] for television, his star being located at 1651 Vine Street.

==Personal life==
Buttons married actress Roxanne Arlen in 1947, but the marriage soon ended in divorce. He married Helayne McNorton on December 8, 1949.  They divorced in 1963. His last marriage was to Alicia Pratts, which lasted from January 27, 1964, until her death in March 2001. Buttons had two children, Amy Buttons and Adam Buttons. He was the advertising spokesman for [[Century Village, Florida]], a [[retirement community]].

Buttons was an early member of the Synagogue for the Performing Arts, and at the time Rabbi [[Jerome Cutler]] was the Rabbi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.forward.com/articles/8150/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-06-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090717234252/http://www.forward.com/articles/8150/ |archivedate=2009-07-17 |df= }} ''The Forward''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===

Buttons died of complications from [[cardiovascular disease]] on July 13, 2006, at age 87 at his home in [[Century City (Los Angeles)|Century City]], Los Angeles. He had been ill for a while and was with family members when he died. His ashes were given to his family after cremation.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/5178496.stm ''Comedian Red Buttons dies at 87''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060720134851/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/5178496.stm |date=2006-07-20 }}.
