'''Kevin Gerard Meaney''' (April 23, 1956 – October 21, 2016) was an American stand-up comedian and actor.

==Career==
Meaney began his career in comedy in 1980. His big break into mainstream culture is considered to be his first HBO comedy special in 1986, followed by his debut performance on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' in 1987.&lt;ref name="typepad1"&gt;{{cite news|work=The Miami Herald |url=http://miamiherald.typepad.com/gaysouthflorida/2009/10/comic-kevin-meaney-shuts-door-on-his-closet-life.html|title=Comic Kevin Meaney Shuts Door On His Closet Life|date=2012-01-30|accessdate=2013-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After that, his act was broadcast several times by [[HBO]], [[Comedy Central]] and several network television stations with appearances on ''The Tonight Show'', ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'', ''[[Live with Kelly#1988–00: Live! with Regis and Kathie Lee|Live! with Regis and Kathie Lee]]'', ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' and ''[[Conan (TV Series)|Conan]]''.&lt;ref name="sun-sentinel1996"&gt;{{cite news|first=Jeff|last=Rusnak|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1996-03-22/entertainment/9603200429_1_kevin-meaney-peanut-las-vegas|title=Kevin Meaney Turns Life's Mishaps Into His Shtick|work=Sun Sentinel|date=1996-03-22|accessdate=2013-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kevinmeaney.com|title=Official Website Of Kevin Meaney|publisher=Kevinmeaney.com|accessdate=2013-12-05|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19991128053134/http://kevinmeaney.com/|archivedate=1999-11-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His most famous catchphrase was "That's not right!", delivered while doing an impression of his mother, which was followed by, and usually preceded by, her complaints and remonstrations. Typically, his act consisted of commentary about his family and complaints about hotel service. Often, Meaney closed his show with a rendition of the 1985 song "[[We Are the World]]" which included comical impressions of the various singers who originally sang the song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newportri.com/features/comedy/happy-and-he-knows-it/article_7290059e-5d87-11e1-9516-001871e3ce6c.html|title=Happy And He Knows It|publisher=NewportRI.com|date=2012-02-22|accessdate=2013-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He often ended his performance with a few jokes that intentionally would not get a good response in order to follow them up with a song reminiscent of "I Don't Care" by Jean Lenox and Harry O. Sutton sung about how he doesn't care whether the audience laughs at his jokes.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

Meaney was involved in a number of television programs, including ''[[Ned &amp; Stacey]]'', ''[[Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist|Dr. Katz]]'', ''[[Space Ghost Coast to Coast]]'', ''[[Garfield and Friends]]'', ''[[Rocko's Modern Life]]'', ''[[London Underground]]'', and ''[[Duckman]]''. He starred as the title character on the short-lived [[sitcom]] version of ''[[Uncle Buck (1990 TV series)|Uncle Buck]]''.

He was also a singer and musician, writing and producing songs for HBO and Comedy Central with his co-writer [[Martin Olson]], with whom he wrote several television series. He intermittently appeared on ''[[Jay Thomas|The Jay Thomas Show]]'' as a co-host. In 1996, he wrote and performed a one-man play titled ''Vegas Vows'' based loosely on his brief marriage to a woman he had just met.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Deffaa|first=Chip|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,293272,00.html|title=A Veiled Threat|publisher=Ew.com|date=1996-07-12|accessdate=2013-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For seven years in the 2000s, Meaney performed in various roles in the Broadway musical ''[[Hairspray (musical)|Hairspray]]''.

==Personal life==
Meaney was born the third child of five in White Plains, New York. When he was 39 years old, he married a woman he had just met in Las Vegas. The marriage was annulled shortly afterwards.&lt;ref name="sun-sentinel1996"/&gt; He later married television executive Mary Ann Halford and they had one daughter.&lt;ref name="typepad1"/&gt;

In 2002, Meaney was arrested at the San Francisco International Airport. After his wife set off a metal detector and lifted her shirt high enough to expose her bra, he reportedly got belligerent and was asked twice not to film the security operations of the terminal. A scuffle with police ensued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Henry K. Lee |url=http://www.sfgate.com/crime/article/Security-no-joke-for-comic-arrested-at-SFO-2867148.php |title=Security No Joke For Comic Arrested At SFO |publisher=Sfgate.com |date=2002-03-05 |accessdate=2013-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[XM Radio]]'s "Stand Up Sit Down" on May 5, 2008, Meaney stated publicly that he was gay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kevinmeaney.com/bio.html|title=Kevin Meany biography|publisher=Kevinmeaney.com|date=2008-05-28|accessdate=2013-12-05|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161025171913/http://www.kevinmeaney.com/bio.html|archivedate=2016-10-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He explained that his time on Broadway was where he gained the courage to accept his homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0911/24/joy.01.html|title=Joy Behar Show Aired November 24, 2009|publisher=Transcripts.cnn.com|accessdate=2013-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, he and his wife divorced.&lt;ref name="typepad1"/&gt;

==Death==
Meaney died on October 21, 2016, at age 60 and was unresponsive when found in his home in [[Forestburgh, New York]].&lt;ref name=NYTObit&gt;{{cite news|author=Rosenberg, Eli|date=22 October 2016|title=Kevin Meaney, Veteran Stand-Up Comedian, Dies at 60|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/23/arts/television/kevin-meaney-dead.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|location=New York City|accessdate= 24 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''Eastern Daily News'' the [[autopsy]] was inconclusive but shows that he died from a heart attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Eastern News Daily|url=https://easterndaily.com/kevin-meaney-dead-uncle-buck-cause-of-death/|title=Kevin Meaney From ‘Uncle Buck’ Dies, Cause Of Death Revealed|author=Johnson, Victor|date=October 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
