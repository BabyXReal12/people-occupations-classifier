'''David William Thomas''' (born May 20, 1949) is a Canadian comedian, actor and television writer. He is best known for portraying [[Bob and Doug McKenzie|Doug McKenzie]] on ''[[Second City Television|SCTV]]'' as well as in the film ''[[Strange Brew]]'', which he also directed.

==Early life==
David William Thomas was born May 20, 1949 in [[St. Catharines]], [[Ontario]]. He is the eldest son of Moreen Duff (Muir), a Scottish-born church organist for thirty years, and composer of church music, and [[John E. Thomas]] (1926–1996), a Welsh-born medical ethicist, head of the Philosophy Department at [[McMaster University]], and the author of several books. His younger brother [[Ian Thomas (singer-songwriter)|Ian]] is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] singer-songwriter. The family moved to [[Durham, North Carolina]], where his father attended [[Duke University]] and earned a PhD in Philosophy. Thomas attended George Watts and Moorehead elementary schools. The family moved back to [[Dundas, Ontario]] in 1961 where Thomas attended [[Dundas District]] high school and later, graduated with an honours Bachelor of Arts degree in English Literature from [[McMaster University]] in [[Hamilton, Ontario]].{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Thomas was granted an honorary doctorate from [[McMaster University]] November 20, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Hamilton Spectator newspaper November 13, 2009|url=http://thespec.com/News/Local/article/672001|accessdate=2009-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Starting his career as a [[copywriter]] at ad agency [[McCann Erickson]] in 1974, he became the head writer of the [[Coca-Cola]] account in Canada within a year. After watching a [[The Second City|Second City]] stage show in Toronto, and while suffering from self-proclaimed "boredom" in his advertising work, he auditioned for the Second City troupe and was chosen as a performer.&lt;ref&gt;Plume, Kenneth (February 10, 2000). [http://movies.ign.com/articles/035/035845p1.html "Interview with Dave Thomas (Part 1 of 5)"]. [[IGN]].&lt;/ref&gt; He was a cast member of the Toronto production of [[Godspell]], along with [[Victor Garber]], [[Martin Short]], [[Eugene Levy]], [[Gilda Radner]], and [[Andrea Martin]]. [[Paul Shaffer]]  was the musical director. He first achieved fame as a cast member of the Canadian TV comedy series ''[[Second City Television|SCTV]]'', joining ''Godspell'' castmates Levy, Martin and later Short, plus [[Rick Moranis]], [[John Candy]], [[Harold Ramis]], [[Catherine O'Hara]] and others. Notable characters on the show include [[Bob and Doug McKenzie|Doug McKenzie]] of beer-swilling brothers [[Bob and Doug McKenzie]], editorialist ''Bill Needle'', Scottish scone-chef/bluesman ''Angus Crock'', motor-mouthed TV ad announcer ''Harvey K-Tel'', Lowery organist/curio pitchman ''Tex Boil'' and the unforgettable "Cruising Gourmet".

Thomas's first movie was ''[[Home to Stay]]'' directed by [[Delbert Mann]] where Thomas played in a scene with Hollywood legend [[Henry Fonda]]. He then wrote for, co-directed and starred in the Bob &amp; Doug McKenzie feature film ''[[Strange Brew]]''. Soon after, he wrote for and acted in ''[[The New Show]]'', produced by Lorne Michaels during his hiatus from [[Saturday Night Live]]. Short-lived, this show featured a powerhouse writing staff including Thomas along with [[Buck Henry]], [[George Meyer]], [[Jack Handey]], [[Al Franken]], [[Tom Davis (comedian)|Tom Davis]], [[Valri Bromfield]] and [[Steve Martin]]. Thomas tried his hand at network television hour-long shows in 1986 when he wrote and co-executive produced ''[[Steel Collar Man]]'' for [[CBS]]. The pilot was produced but did not go to series. In 1988 Thomas wrote another hour long show for CBS, ''[[B Men]]'', which was back ordered, but Thomas took a directing job at [[Paramount Television|Paramount]], which caused the network to drop the series. He reportedly introduced [[John Travolta]] and [[Kelly Preston]] while directing them in the Paramount film ''[[The Experts (1989 film)|The Experts]]''.

He wrote for, produced, and starred in ''[[The Dave Thomas Comedy Show]]'' (1990). In 1991, he starred in the [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] comedy, ''Public Enemy #2''. In 1992, he tried his hand at reality TV and co-executive produced [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[America's Funniest People]]'' with [[Vin Di Bona]], but left after thirteen weeks to appear in the film ''[[Coneheads (film)|Coneheads]]''. In 1993, he officially co-starred in ABC's ''[[Grace Under Fire]]'' with [[Brett Butler (comedian)|Brett Butler]] and [[Tom Poston]] and continued with the show for 5 seasons. In 1995 Thomas starred in ABC TV movie ''[[Picture Perfect (1995 film)|Picture Perfect]]'' with [[Mary Page Keller]] and [[Richard Karn]]. In 1996, Thomas played the title role in the Fox TV movie ''[[Mr. Foster's Field Trip]]'' aka ''[[Kidz in the Wood (film)|Kidz in the Wood]]'' with [[Julia Duffy]]. In  1996, he wrote the book ''SCTV: Behind the Scenes'' ([[McClelland &amp; Stewart]], publishers). From 1999-2002, he voiced various roles on the animated series ''[[Mission Hill (TV series)|Mission Hill]]''. {{Citation needed|date=November 2012}} He also voiced Rex Banner in the Simpsons.

Thomas co-starred in the Paramount feature ''[[Rat Race (2001 film)|Rat Race]]''. As of 2001, Thomas has been the Executive Creative Director of [[Animax Entertainment]], an [[animation]] studio based officially in [[Culver City, California]]. In 2001-2002 Thomas appeared with [[Eugene Levy]] and [[Martin Short]] on Short's show ''[[Primetime Glick]]'' as [[Bob Hope]] (an impression he had first developed for ''SCTV'' with great success). In 2002, he co-starred with [[Jason Priestley]], [[Dave Foley]] and [[Ewen Bremner]] in ''[[Fancy Dancing]]''. The next year he played a lead role in ''[[Beethoven's Fifth]]''. In 2003, he directed a hospital comedy feature film entitled ''[[Intern Academy|Whitecoats]]'', which he also wrote. As of 2004, Thomas was on the official Advisory Committee for the [[Humber College#Comedy: Writing and Performance|Comedy program]] at [[Humber College]], the only such diploma program in the world. In 2004, he and Moranis reprised the voices of the McKenzie Brothers in [[Disney]]'s animated feature ''[[Brother Bear]]''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/06/movies/these-two-talking-moose-let-their-antlers-down.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas has had a long career doing voices for animation including ''[[Animaniacs]]'', ''[[Duckman]]'', ''[[CatDog]]'', ''[[The Adventures of Tarzan]]'', ''[[Justice League of America]]'' and multiple roles on ''[[The Simpsons]],'' ''[[King of the Hill]]'' and ''[[Family Guy]]''. In 2005, he had a guest stint as [[Charlize Theron]]'s "Uncle Trevor" on Fox's ''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]]''. In 2006, he reprised his voice role in ''[[Brother Bear 2]]'' and appeared as himself in the feature film ''[[The Aristocrats (film)|The Aristocrats]]''. He began production on ''[[ArnoldSpeaks.com]]'', a [[video blog]], as the voice of [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]; Animax Entertainment won an Emmy for a broadband animated series produced for ESPN, ''[[Off Mikes]]''.

In 2007, Thomas and [[Rick Moranis]] reprised their roles as Bob and Doug McKenzie in a one-hour special "[[Bob &amp; Doug McKenzie's Two-Four Anniversary]]" for CBC Television. The show featured cameos from McKenzie celeb fans like [[Ben Stiller]], [[Dave Foley]], [[Tom Green]], [[Paul Shaffer]], [[Andy Dick]], [[Matt Groening]], [[Barry Pepper]], [[Martin Short]], and [[Geddy Lee]]. Former Prime Minister of Canada [[Paul Martin]] was the host. In 2008, Thomas revived Bob and Doug McKenzie in a new animated series, ''[[Bob &amp; Doug (2009 TV series)|Bob &amp; Doug]]''. While Thomas reprises the character of Doug in the new series, Moranis chose not to voice the character of Bob, which instead is voiced by [[Dave Coulier]]. Moranis is, however, involved in the series as an executive producer.&lt;ref name=star&gt;Rob Salem, [https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/Television/article/620381 "Bob &amp; Doug taking off again"]. ''[[Toronto Star]]'', April 19, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2009, Thomas received an [[Honorary Doctor of Letters]] from his alma mater [[McMaster University]] and gave the fall convocation speech. In 2010 Animax continued to produce branded entertainment, advertising and digital shorts for corporations like [[Disney]], [[Warner Brothers]], [[NBC Universal]], and [[Kodak]]. In 2011, Thomas' company Animax produced another animated show for MTV entitled [[Big Box]] along with numerous Internet shorts such as ''[[Life With Dad]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Pearce, Cameron (April 12, 2011). [http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/5e7d7c3cf7/life-with-dad-dog "Life With Dad 'Dog'"]. [[Funny or Die]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pearce, Cameron (April 12, 2011).
