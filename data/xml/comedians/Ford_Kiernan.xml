Ford first performed comedy in 1990 at Glasgow's Comedy Club in the basement of Blackfriar's pub in the Merchant City. He took up performing in 1993.
A run of successful solo spots led to him being offered a slot in the [[Edinburgh Comedy Festival]] in 1994 in a show called The Best Of Scottish Comedy alongside John Paul Leach and Alan Taylor. Leach and Kiernan teamed up as a double act during this festival and were to have shows at the next two festivals ("After Eight Mince" and "The Full Bhoona"), both at the [[Gilded Balloon]].
