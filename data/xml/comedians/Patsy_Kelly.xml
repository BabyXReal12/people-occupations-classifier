[[File:Tin Man lobby card.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Lobby card for short comedy ''The Tin Man'' (1935) with Patsy Kelly and [[Thelma Todd]]]]
'''Patsy Kelly''' (January 12, 1910 &amp;ndash; September 24, 1981) was an American actress. She is known for her role as the brash, wisecracking sidekick to [[Thelma Todd]] in a series of short comedy films produced by [[Hal Roach]] in the 1930s. Known as the '''Queen of Wisecracks''', Kelly's career continued after Todd's death in 1935 in similar roles.

After her film career declined in the mid-1940s, Kelly returned to New York where she worked in radio and [[Summer stock theatre|summer stock]]. She also became a lifelong friend and personal assistant of [[Tallulah Bankhead]]. Kelly returned to the screen after 17 years with guest spots on television and in film roles.

In 1971, Kelly returned to the stage in the revival of ''[[No, No, Nanette]]'' for which she won a [[Tony Award]]. She continued appearing in film and television roles until she suffered a stroke in January 1980 that limited her ability to speak. Kelly died of cancer in 1981.

==Early life and early career==

Kelly was born '''Sarah Veronica Rose Kelly''' in [[Brooklyn]] to Irish immigrants parents John (died 1942) and Delia Kelly (1875-1930). She began her career in [[vaudeville]] as a dancer at the age of 12.&lt;ref name=ocala&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=dZVPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=RQUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5920,5392077&amp;dq=patsy+kelly+tony+award&amp;hl=en|title='Company' Takes 6 Honors At Tony Awards|date=1971-03-29|work=Ocala Star-Banner|page=5B|accessdate=5 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She performed in [[Frank Fay (American actor)|Frank Fay's]] act, first in a song-and-dance routine and later as Fay's comic foil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Byrne|first1=James P. |last2=Coleman |first2=Philip |last3=King|first3=Jason Francis |title=Ireland and the Americas|year=2008|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=1-851-09614-0|page=326}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one routine, Kelly told Fay and the audience that she had been at the beauty parlor. Fay remarked, "And they didn't wait on you?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=S.D.|first=Trav |title=No Applause--Just Throw Money: The Book That Made Vaudeville Famous|year=2006|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=0-865-47958-5|page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; She remained with Fay for several seasons until Fay eventually dismissed her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cullen|first=Frank |title=Vaudeville Old &amp; New: An Encyclopedia of Variety Performers in America, Volume 1|volume=1|year=2004|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=0-415-93853-8|page=627}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kelly made her [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] debut in 1928. In 1930 and 1931, she performed for producer [[Earl Carroll]] in his ''Sketches'' and ''Vanities'' musicals.

==Film career==
Kelly made her screen debut in a [[Vitaphone]] short subject filmed there. In 1933 producer [[Hal Roach]] hired Kelly to co-star with [[Thelma Todd]] in a series of short-subject comedies. The Todd-Kelly shorts cemented Kelly's image: a brash, wisecracking woman who frequently punctured the pomposity of other characters. Later entries in the series showcased Kelly's dancing skills. Kelly made 35 shorts with Todd before Todd died in 1935. [[Lyda Roberti]] replaced Todd, but died of heart failure in 1938.&lt;ref name=blade&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=MAwwAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=-QAEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7463,6645483&amp;dq=patsy+kelly&amp;hl=en|title=Patsy Kelly Goes Back To Films After 16 Years|last=Thomas|first=Bob|date=1959-11-25|work=Toledo Blade|accessdate=5 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the popularity of shorts began to wane, Kelly moved to full-length feature films, often playing working-class character roles in comedies and musicals. One of her memorable roles was as Etta, the cook, in the five Academy Awards-nominated 1938 comedy movie ''[[Merrily We Live]]''.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

By 1943, Kelly's film career had begun to decline. She appeared in films for [[Producers Releasing Corporation]], the smallest and cheapest of the movie studios. Her last starring roles were in two PRC comedies, ''My Son, the Hero'' and ''Danger! Women at Work'', both released in 1943. Kelly left Hollywood and would not make another film for 17 years.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==Later career==

After leaving Hollywood, Kelly returned to New York City where she worked in radio and did summer stock. She also worked as a personal assistant to [[Tallulah Bankhead]].&lt;ref name=blade /&gt;&lt;ref name=monush&gt;{{cite book|last=Monush|first=Barry |title=The Encyclopedia of Hollywood Film Actors: From the Silent Era to 1965, Volume 1|volume=1|year=2003|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|isbn=1-557-83551-9|page=388}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kelly returned to the screen in the 1950s with television and sporadic film roles. On television she appeared in guest roles on ''[[26 Men]]'', ''[[Kraft Television Theatre]]'', ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E]]'', ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]'', ''[[The Wild Wild West]]'', and ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'', as well as many unsold pilots. She also made a memorable appearance as Laura-Louise in the film thriller ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]'' (1968), directed by [[Roman Polanski]], alongside veteran actors [[Sidney Blackmer]], [[Ruth Gordon]], and [[Maurice Evans (actor)|Maurice Evans]].

She returned to Broadway in 1971 in the revival of ''[[No, No, Nanette]]'' with fellow hoofers [[Ruby Keeler]] and [[Helen Gallagher]]. Kelly scored a huge success as the wisecracking, tap-dancing maid, and won Broadway's 1971 [[Tony Award]] for [[Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Musical|Best Featured Actress in a Musical]] for her performance in the show.&lt;ref name=ocala /&gt; She matched that success the following year when she starred in ''[[Irene (musical)|Irene]]'' with [[Debbie Reynolds]], and was again nominated for a Tony.

In 1976, she appeared as the housekeeper Mrs. Schmauss in the film ''[[Freaky Friday (1976 film)|Freaky Friday]]'' starring [[Jodie Foster]] and [[Barbara Harris (actress)|Barbara Harris]]. Her final movie appearance was in the 1979 Disney comedy ''[[The North Avenue Irregulars]]'', also co-starring Harris, along with [[Cloris Leachman]], [[Edward Herrmann]] and [[Karen Valentine]].  Kelly's last onscreen appearance was a guest spot in a two-part episode of ''[[The Love Boat]]'' in 1979.

==Personal life==

Kelly was openly gay. She publicly disclosed to being a "dyke".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gever|first=Martha |title=Entertaining Lesbians: Celebrity, Sexuality, and Self-Invention |edition=1|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-94480-5|page=210}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1930s, she disclosed to ''[[Motion Picture Magazine|Motion Picture]]'' magazine that she had been living with actress Wilma Cox for several years and had no intention of getting married.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Faderman|first1=Lillian |last2=Timmons|first2=Stuart |title=Gay L. A.: A History of Social Vagrants, Hollywood Rejects, And Lipstick Lesbians|year=2006|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=0-465-02288-X|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; She later claimed she had an affair with Tallulah Bankhead when she worked as Bankhead's personal assistant.&lt;ref name=monush /&gt;

In August 1933 Kelly was injured as a passenger in a sedan driven by [[Gene Malin]], the prominent drag performer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Backs Car Over Pier; Is Killed, Two Hurt|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1928&amp;dat=19330811&amp;id=BM0gAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=2WoFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4281,2852166|accessdate=May 1, 2014|newspaper=The Lewiston Daily Sun|page=1|date=August 11, 1933}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malin apparently confused the gears and reversed off a pier into the water, after leaving a club in [[Venice, Los Angeles]]. Kelly suffered serious injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jean Malin Killed, Patsy Kelly Injured|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1898&amp;dat=19330811&amp;id=QlcpAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=EW4FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4355,3260833|accessdate=May 1, 2014|newspaper=The Norwalk Hour|page=15|date=August 11, 1933}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Entertainer Dies In Auto Plunge|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1129&amp;dat=19330811&amp;id=Ov8MAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=N2kDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6677,5514933|accessdate=May 1, 2014|newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|page=7|date=August 11, 1933}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1980, Kelly suffered a stroke while in [[San Francisco]] that caused her to lose the ability to speak. She was admitted to Englewood Nursing Home in Englewood, New Jersey, on the advice of her old friend [[Ruby Keeler]] where she underwent therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=IR5UAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=mI0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5473,486227&amp;dq=patsy+kelly+stroke&amp;hl=en|title=Patsy Recovering From Loss Of Speech|date=1980-05-04|work=Boca Raton News|page=7B|accessdate=5 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
On September 24, 1981, Kelly died of cancer at the [[Motion Picture &amp; Television Country House and Hospital]] in [[Woodland Hills, Los Angeles|Woodland Hills, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Actress Patsy Kelly dies of cancer|date=1981-09-24|work=Eugene Register-Guard|page=3A|accessdate=4 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/26/obituaries/patsy-kelly-actress-is-dead-played-comic-roles-in-films.html|title=PATSY KELLY, ACTRESS IS DEAD: PLAYED COMIC ROLES IN FILMS|last=Flints|first=Peter B.|date=1981-09-26|work=The New York Times|page=28|accessdate=5 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is interred alongside her parents, John and Delia Kelly, in [[Calvary Cemetery (Queens, New York)|Calvary Cemetery]] in [[Queens]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Scott.
