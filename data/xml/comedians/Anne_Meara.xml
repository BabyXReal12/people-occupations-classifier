'''Anne Meara''' (September 20, 1929&amp;nbsp;– May 23, 2015) was an American actress and comedian. Along with her husband [[Jerry Stiller]], she was one-half of a prominent 1960s comedy team, [[Stiller and Meara]]. She also was featured on stage, in television, and in numerous films, and later she became a playwright.

During her career, Meara was nominated for four [[Emmy Awards]] and a [[Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Play|Tony Award]], and she won a [[Writers Guild Award]] as a co-writer for the TV movie ''[[The Other Woman (1983 film)|The Other Woman]]''.

==Early years==
Meara was born in [[Brooklyn, New York]],&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; the daughter of parents of Irish descent,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bloom|first=Nate|authorlink=Nate Bloom|date=March 17, 2009|url=http://www.interfaithfamily.com/arts_and_entertainment/popular_culture/St.shtml|publisher=InterfaithFamily.com|title=A Pint of Guinness, A Cup of Manischevitz: Some Irish/Jewish Connections|accessdate=May 25, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150706041612/http://www.interfaithfamily.com/arts_and_entertainment/popular_culture/St.shtml|archivedate=July 6, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mary (née Dempsey) (1896–1941)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/41/Anne-Meara.html|title=Anne Meara profile|publisher=FilmReference.com|accessdate=May 25, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150415184154/http://www.filmreference.com/film/41/Anne-Meara.html|archivedate=April 15, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Edward Joseph Meara (1894–1979), a lawyer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1966/12/16/archives/ej-meara-creator-of-comedy-skits-73.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=E.J.

When Anne was 12 years old, her mother committed suicide.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/25/arts/anne-meara-comedian-and-actress-dies-at-85.html|title=Anne Meara, Comedian and Actress, Dies at 85|work=The New York Times|date=May 24, 2015|accessdate=May 24, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150524220053/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/25/arts/anne-meara-comedian-and-actress-dies-at-85.html|archivedate=May 24, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When she was 18, Meara spent a year studying acting at the Dramatic Workshop at [[The New School]] in Manhattan. The following year, 1948, she began her career as an actress  in [[Summer stock theatre|summer stock]].&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

==Career==

===Comedy team===
Meara met actor-comedian [[Jerry Stiller]] in 1953, and they married in 1955, after a two-year relationship. Until he suggested it, she had never thought of doing comedy. "Jerry started us being a comedy team," she said. "He always thought I would be a great comedy partner."&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; They joined the [[improv comedy|improvisational]] company [[The Compass Players]] (which later became [[The Second City]]), and after leaving, formed the comedy team of [[Stiller and Meara]]. In 1961, they were performing in nightclubs in New York, and by the following year were considered a "national phenomenon", said the ''New York Times''.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

Their often improvised comedy routines brought many of their relationship foibles to live audiences. Their skits focused on domestic themes, as did [[Nichols and May]], another comedy team during that period. "They were Nichols and May without the acid and with warmth," notes author [[Lawrence Epstein]].&lt;ref name=Epstein&gt;Epstein, Lawrence. ''Mixed Nuts: America's Love Affair with Comedy Teams'', PublicAffairs, Perseus Book (2004) p. 224&lt;/ref&gt; They also added a new twist to their comedy act, he adds, by sometimes playing up the fact that Stiller was Jewish and Meara was Catholic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H--kLKTGzaQ|title=Stiller &amp; Meara on Computer Dating|first=|last=Johnny Carson|date=August 27, 2012|publisher=|accessdate=April 30, 2018|via=YouTube|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180307042302/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H--kLKTGzaQ|archivedate=March 7, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Nichols and May broke up as a team in 1961, Stiller and Meara were the number-one couple comedy team by the late 1960s. And as [[Mike Nichols]] and [[Elaine May]] were not married, Stiller and Meara became the most famous married couple comedy team since [[Burns and Allen]].&lt;ref name=Hollywood/&gt;

After some years honing the act, Stiller and Meara became regulars on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', with 36 appearances,&lt;ref name=Hollywood&gt;[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/anne-meara-dead-ben-stillers-797806 "Anne Meara, Comedian of Stiller &amp; Meara Fame, Dies at 85"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150525222715/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/anne-meara-dead-ben-stillers-797806 |date=May 25, 2015 }}, ''Hollywood Reporter'', May 24, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; and other TV programs, including ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]''. They released their first LP in 1963, ''Presenting America’s New Comedy Sensation: Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara Live at The [[Hungry I]]'', which became a hit. By 1970, however, they broke up their act because it was affecting their marriage: "I didn't know where the act ended and our marriage began," complained Meara in 1977.&lt;ref name=Hollywood/&gt; Stiller agreed, fearing, "I would have lost her as a wife."&lt;ref name=Hollywood/&gt;

===Television, stage, film, video===
During the 1970s, Meara and Stiller wrote and performed many radio commercials together for [[Blue Nun Wine]]. She had a recurring role on the sitcom ''[[Rhoda]]'' as airline stewardess Sally Gallagher, one of the title character's best friends. She also had a small role as Mrs. Curry opposite [[Laurence Olivier]] in ''[[The Boys from Brazil (film)|The Boys from Brazil]]'' (1978). 

In 1975, she starred in her own series ''[[Kate McShane]]'' on CBS, for which she was nominated for an [[Emmy Award]] (1976 Outstanding Lead Actress In A Drama Series), but the series was cancelled after 10 episodes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tv.com/shows/kate-mcshane/ ''Kate McShane''] TV.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/kate-mcshane/202486 ''Kate McShane''] TV Guide&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.emmys.com/bios/anne-meara "Anne Meara Biography and Emmy"] emmys.com, retrieved August 17, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Meara provided voice-overs for some short clips from silent films on [[Sesame Street]].

Meara costarred with [[Carroll O'Connor]] and [[Martin Balsam]] in the early 1980s hit sitcom ''[[Archie Bunker's Place]]'', which was a continuation of the influential 1970s sitcom ''[[All in the Family]]''. She played the role of Veronica Rooney, the bar's cook, for the show's first three seasons (1979–1982). During that time, she acted in the movie ''[[Fame (1980 film)|Fame]]'' (1980), in which she played English teacher Elizabeth Sherwood.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0oLHmOoErE "Mrs. Sherwood's Classroom in ''Fame''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310104757/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0oLHmOoErE |date=March 10, 2016 }}, video clip&lt;/ref&gt; She also appeared as the grandmother in the TV series ''[[ALF (TV series)|ALF]]'' in the late 1980s. ''[[The Stiller and Meara Show]]'', her own 1986 TV sitcom, in which Stiller played the deputy mayor of New York City and Meara portrayed his wife, a television commercial actress, was unsuccessful. From 1999 to 2007, Meara guest starred on ''[[The King of Queens]]'' (where her husband played [[Arthur Spooner]]), first as Mary Finnegan, then as Veronica Olchin (mother of [[Spence Olchin|Spence]], who was played by [[Patton Oswalt]]). Veronica and Arthur were married in [[China Syndrome (The King of Queens)|the series finale]], but divorced a year later.

Starting in October 2010, Meara and her husband Jerry Stiller began starring in a [[Yahoo!]] web series called ''[[Stiller &amp; Meara]]'' produced by [[Red Hour Productions|Red Hour Digital]], a production company owned by their son [[Ben Stiller]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Stiller-Parents-Yahoo-1019875.aspx|title=Meet Ben Stiller's Parents on New Yahoo!

She accepted a role in the [[off-Broadway]] play ''[[Love, Loss, and What I Wore]]'' with [[Conchata Ferrell]], [[AnnaLynne McCord]], [[Minka Kelly]], and [[B. Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/149900-Minka-Kelly-Susan-Sullivan-Set-for-Love-Loss-Off-Broadway|title=Minka Kelly, Susan Sullivan Set for Love, Loss...

===Writing and consulting===
In 1995, Meara wrote the comedy ''After-Play'', which became an off-Broadway production.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ULIc4sES3gAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=anne+meara+after-play "After-Play" script], Dramatists Play Service (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; In her later years, she portrayed recurring roles on the television shows ''[[Sex and the City]]'' (as Mary Brady) and ''The King of Queens'' (as Veronica Olchin). During the 2004–05 season, she appeared in an episode of ''[[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit]]''.

She was the consulting director of J.A.P. – The [[Jewish-American princess stereotype|Jewish American Princesses]] of Comedy, a 2007 off-Broadway production that featured live stand-up routines by four female Jewish comics juxtaposed with the stories of legendary performers from the 1950s and 1960s: [[Totie Fields]], [[Jean Carroll]], [[Pearl Williams]], [[Betty Walker]], and [[Belle Barth]].{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

In 2009, Meara wrote her personal life reflections in a New York-focused online blog, titled ''Mr. Beller's Neighborhood -- New York City Stories''. In it, Meara recalled her mother's death and her childhood experiences at Catholic boarding school.&lt;ref name="ref13"&gt;{{cite news|last=Meara|first=Anne|title=Old Nuns|publisher=|date= June 8, 2009|url=http://mrbellersneighborhood.com/story.php?storyid=2283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==

===Religion, marriage, family===
Meara was born, baptised and raised a [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]]. She [[Conversion to Judaism|converted]] to [[Judaism]] six years after marrying Stiller.&lt;ref name="Meara1"&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Toole |first=Lesley |title=Ben Stiller : 'Doing Comedy Is Scary' |work=[[The Independent]] |date=December 22, 2006 |url=http://enjoyment.independent.co.uk/film/features/article2092609.ece |accessdate=December 22, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070108222337/http://enjoyment.independent.co.uk/film/features/article2092609.ece |archivedate=January 8, 2007 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/26869930.html?dids=26869930:26869930&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Mar+01%2C+1998&amp;author=Elaine+Dutka&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;desc=THEATER%3B+Finding+an+Afterlife+as+a+Playwright%3B+When+comic+actress+Anne+Meara+finally+learned+to+accept+herself%2C+she+was+ready+to+write+'After-Play.'&amp;pqatl=google|title=LA Times|author=|date=|website=pqarchiver.com|accessdate=April 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She insisted that she did not convert at Stiller's request, explaining, "Catholicism was dead to me." She took her conversion seriously and studied the Jewish faith in such depth that her Jewish-born husband quipped, "Being married to Anne has made me more Jewish."&lt;ref name="ref12"&gt;{{cite news|last=Elkin|first=Michael|title=ON THE SCENE: Stiller and Meara marry comedy and a home life|pages=|work=Jewish Exponent|date=July 28, 1995|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-2352152.html|accessdate=December 22, 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104211900/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-2352152.html|archivedate=November 4, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; They discussed how they met and their early career during a guest appearance on the TV game show ''[[What's My Line?]]'' in 1968.&lt;ref name=Line&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mf1xWzUBKg0 "Stiller &amp; Meara on "What's My Line?"

Together, Meara and her husband had two children, Amy (born 1961) and [[Ben Stiller|Ben]] (born 1965).
