Plaza played Darius, a jaded intern who answers a curious want ad "seeking a companion for a time traveling adventure". Her performance in the film was critically acclaimed, and Gary Thompson of ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' questioned whether this role was out of her usual "pretty slacker" range but found her performance "compelling".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thompson|first=Gary|title=Aubrey Plaza shines in ‘Safety Not Guaranteed'|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/entertainment/20120615_Aubrey_Plaza_shines_in__lsquo_Safety_Not_Guaranteed_.html|work=The Philadelphia Inquirer|date=June 15, 2012|accessdate=July 6, 2012|quote=It's too early to say if Plaza's an actress, since no one's asked her to do anything other than be the pretty slacker with the bored posture and world-weary intonation. But she has an unusual kind of beauty (Anglo-Irish, Latina) that the camera loves to explore, and when she does make the hyperspace jump to sincerity and initiative, the results are compelling.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[2014 Sundance Film Festival]] in January 2014, Plaza's film, ''[[Life After Beth]]'', which was written and directed by her boyfriend Jeff Baena, premiered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inthemixxshow.com/4143/youll-never-guess-aubrey-plazas-kinky-on-set-ritual|title=You'll Never Guess Aubrey Plaza's Kinky On-Set Ritual!|publisher=In the Mixx|date=October 17, 2013|accessdate=June 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
