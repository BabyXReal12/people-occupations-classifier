From 2000 to 2004, Anderson co-hosted the [[triple j]] breakfast radio show with [[Adam Spencer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bio|url=https://adamspencer.com.au/bio/|website=Adam Spencer - The Big Book of Numbers|publisher=Adam Spencer|accessdate=26 January 2015|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2001 and 2006, Anderson hosted the comedy talk-show ''[[The Glass House (2001 TV series)|The Glass House]]'', broadcast on [[ABC (Australia)|ABC]], alongside [[Corinne Grant]] and [[Dave Hughes]]. In November 2006, the show was cancelled amid media speculation that the cancellation was made due to pressure from the Howard Government.&lt;ref name="newscomau"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/story/0,10221,20681474-10229,00.html?from=public_rss|title=I didn't axe Glass House: PM|publisher=[[News.com.au]]|date=1 November 2006|accessdate=3 November 2006 | first1=Gerard | last1=McManus}} By staff writers, Gerard McManus and AAP&lt;/ref&gt; Howard responded with, "I do not tell the ABC what programmes it should run. I respect the independence of the ABC."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/tv--radio/abc-shatters-glass-house/2006/11/01/1162339892805.html|title=I didn't get Glass House axed: PM|date=1 November 2006|publisher=Fairfax Media|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|archivedate=19 April 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080419172553/http://www.smh.com.au/news/tv--radio/abc-shatters-glass-house/2006/11/01/1162339892805.html|accessdate=28 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Anderson was nominated for the "Most Popular Presenter" award at the [[Logies]] for his role on the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/tv--radio/logie-award-nominations/2007/04/02/1175366144499.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104193505/http://www.smh.com.au/news/tv--radio/logie-award-nominations/2007/04/02/1175366144499.html|archivedate=4 November 2012|date=2 April 2007|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|title=Logie Award nominations|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anderson was the subject of controversy after he made jokes about the late father of ''[[Australian Idol]]'' finalist [[Shannon Noll]] at the 2006 [[Melbourne International Comedy Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/people/where-theres-a-wil-theres-a-way-out/2006/05/01/1146335659168.html|title=Where there's a Wil there's a way out|first=David|last=Braithwaite|date=1 May 2006|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|publisher=Fairfax Media|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106190837/http://www.smh.com.au/news/people/where-theres-a-wil-theres-a-way-out/2006/05/01/1146335659168.html|archivedate=6 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From April 2007 to November 2008, Anderson joined with [[Lehmo]] to host ''[[Wil &amp; Lehmo]]'', an afternoon drive-time radio program on Triple M.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.radioinfo.com.au/news/lehmo-join-wil-anderson-triple-m-drive|title=Lehmo to join Wil Anderson on Triple M drive|date=8 February 2007|access-date=20 February 2016|publisher=Radioinfo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/sydney-confidential/wil-anderson-tony-lehmann-sacked-from-triple-m/story-e6frewz0-1111117936053|title=Wil Anderson, Tony Lehmann sacked from Triple M|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=4 November 2008|access-date=20 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Anderson made a guest appearance on ''[[Have You Been Paying Attention?]]''.

===Standup comedy=== 
While Anderson's television and radio career has made him a highly recognised figure in Australia, standup comedy remains his foremost discipline.&lt;ref name=Marshall/&gt; Anderson started his career in newspaper journalism before venturing into standup comedy.&lt;ref name=Yoshinaga&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-09-04/wil-anderson-quit-milking-cows-to-do-stand-up-comedy/6747264|title='Milking cows harder than stand-up': Why Wil Anderson ran from dairy to comedy|first=Peta|last=Yoshinaga|date=4 September 2015|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160213100316/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-09-04/wil-anderson-quit-milking-cows-to-do-stand-up-comedy/6747264|archivedate=13 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his early career, Anderson made numerous appearances on ''[[Good News Week]]'', on both the original and revamped versions. On 19 June 1996, Anderson appeared as the guest comedian on the [[RMITV]] Show ''[[Under Melbourne Tonight]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.aanet.com.au/~vfok/umt/episodes/list96.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116120913/http://web.aanet.com.au/~vfok/umt/episodes/list96.htm |archivedate=16 January 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and appeared with [[RMITV]] again on the ''[[Under Melbourne Tonight]]'' spin-off ''[[What's Goin' On There?]]'' on 3 June 1998.

===Podcasts===
Anderson has created a number of podcasts, including ''[[TOFOP]]'', a comedy podcast with friend and actor [[Charlie Clausen]]; ''[[FOFOP]]'', where Anderson chats with 'Guest Charlies' in lieu of Clausen; ''Wilosophy'', where Anderson interviews guests about their life philosophies; and ''2 Guys 1 Cup'', an AFL podcast with Clausen. He has also expressed interest in starting a Survivor recap podcast entitled ''Outwil, Outplay, Outlast.''

''TOFOP'' ("Thirty Odd Foot Of Pod") debuted in 2010 as a weekly podcast in which Anderson and Clausen disused a variety of subjects, including film, popular culture, sport, personal anecdotes, and detailed discussions on bizarre hypothetical situations. Following significant media coverage in June 2012, TOFOP rose to become the most popular comedy podcast in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Bennett | first = Sally | title = Podcasts Freed the Radio Star | date = 23 June 2012 | work = [[Herald Sun]] | url = http://www.heraldsun.com.au/entertainment/arts-books/podcasts-freed-the-radio-star/story-fn7euh6j-1226407876100 | accessdate = 30 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tofop.libsyn.com/|title=TOFOP: Wil Anderson &amp; Charlie Clausen|accessdate=30 September 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110831065746/http://tofop.libsyn.com/|archivedate=31 August 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2012, the podcast was placed on hiatus as a result of Clausen gaining a starring role as Zac MacGuire in popular Australian soap opera ''[[Home and Away]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date = 9 September 2012 | title = TOFOP #83 - Weng Weng | work = TOFOP | url = http://www.tofop.com/tofop-83-weng-weng | accessdate = 9 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The podcast resumed in June 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tofop.com/tofop-84-were-back-were-bad-youre-black-im-mad-2/&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2013 Anderson launched a spin-off podcast, ''FOFOP'', where he is joined by 'Guest Charlies' in lieu of Clausen. Regular guests have included [[Dave Anthony]] (known as Guest Charlie No. 1), [[Justin Hamilton (comedian)|Justin Hamilton]] (known as Hamo), [[Rove McManus]], [[Tom Gleeson]], [[Harley Breen]], [[Lindsay Webb]], [[Felicity Ward]], [[Celia Pacquola]], [[Matt Kirshen]], [[Daniel Sloss]], [[Greg Behrendt]], [[Jen Kirkman]] and [[Gareth Reynolds]].

Anderson launched his ''Wilosophy'' podcast in December 2014. The inaugural episode featured [[Todd Sampson]], while subsequent guests include Adam Spencer, [[Judith Lucy]], [[John Safran]], Felicity Ward, [[Osher Günsberg]], [[Jarrod McKenna]], [[Annabel Crabb]], [[Marc Maron]], [[Dee Madigan]], [[Nazeem Hussain]], [[Corinne Grant]] and [[Karl Kruszelnicki]]. Anderson explained in January 2015 that the podcast will continue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WILOSOPHY with Wil Anderson|url=https://itunes.apple.com/au/podcast/wilosophy-with-wil-anderson/id951354264?mt=2|website=iTunes Preview|publisher=Apple Inc|accessdate=26 January 2015|date=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In March 2016, Anderson and Clausen launched another weekly podcast, ''2 Guys 1 Cup'', in which they discuss [[Australian rules football]].

In a January 2015 episode of podcast ''TOFOP'', Anderson recalled his first [[Logie Awards]] ceremony, held in 2008, when he garnered controversy for his live tweets from the event. Anderson explained that he has never been a fan of the event, as he believes that a large number of other causes for celebration exist in Australia that never receive the recognition they deserve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FOFOP 177- Sniglets Really Satisfy|url=http://tofop.libsyn.com/fofop-177-sniglets-really-satisfy|website=TOFOP - Wil Anderson &amp; Charlie Clausen|publisher=libsyn|accessdate=26 January 2015|format=Audio upload|date=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
