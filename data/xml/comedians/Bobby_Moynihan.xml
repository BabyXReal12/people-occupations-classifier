===Recurring characters on ''SNL''===
* Mark Payne, a waiter who works at Pizzeria Uno. He wears a black do-rag and a black and blue button-down T-shirt featuring Sagara Sanosuke from the anime ''[[Rurouni Kenshin]]'' and always complains about inconsequential things around the pizzeria (the smell of pepper on the first sketch on the episode hosted by Michael Phelps; how sticky the bar counter is in the second sketch on the episode hosted by Tim McGraw). In the first sketch, Mark had a child that he left on a bus and did not realize it until the end of the sketch. The child was never mentioned in the second sketch.{{episode needed|date=October 2013}}
* Anthony Crispino, relays the second-hand news report on ''[[Weekend Update]]'', where he always inaccurately reports on current events.{{episode needed|date=October 2013}}
* Vinny Vedecci Jr, the son of [[Bill Hader]]'s Italian talk show host, Vinny Vedecci. Wears a black and white child's sailor suit. Always wants to ask celebrities ridiculous questions, but the celebrities cannot understand his broken English, which makes him cry (until Vinny gives his son a cigarette and a drink of wine). Vinny Jr. is based on Johnny Caspar, Jr. (played by Louis Charles Mounicou III) in the Coen brothers' [[Miller's Crossing]].
* Liam, one of the kids in Gilly's (played by [[Kristen Wiig]]) elementary school class. It is often implied that he hates his stepfather.{{episode needed|date=October 2013}}
* Obnoxious Microphone Guy, a very annoying man who attends parties and other events, will at some point steal the microphone from the emcee (usually played by [[Jason Sudeikis]]) and obnoxiously scream "WHAAAAAAAAAT!" into the microphone before dropping it on the floor.{{episode needed|date=October 2013}}
* Scared Straight Kid, one of the three young trouble-makers (along with [[Bill Hader]] and [[Andy Samberg]]) lectured by convict Lorenzo McIntosh (played by [[Kenan Thompson]]) and McIntosh's fellow inmates including hosts Taylor Swift, Lindsay Lohan, and Betty White. McIntosh usually throws his shoe out of anger, and in recent sketches he gives it to him to throw.{{episode needed|date=October 2013}}
* Ass Dan, a member of the Kick Spit Underground Rock Festival and winner of the Worst He-Man Impression Contest and the Mud-Eating Contest. Even though the Blake Lively/Rihanna episode established that he died in 2009 at the age of 28 (Ass Dan was born in 1981), he was brought back as one half of the [[Insane Clown Posse|Thrilla Killa Klownz]] on the episode hosted by Ryan Phillippe in the music video [[Miracles (Insane Clown Posse song)#Music video|"Magical Mysteries"]] (in which it was stated that Ass Dan "did just die" in the 2010 sketch, making Ass Dan 29 at the time), brought back again for the 2010 Crunkmas Carnival sketch (in which Li'l Blaster established that Ass Dan was dead and finally getting the wake he deserves), and brought back again for the 2011 Easter Festival (in which D.J. Supersoak established that Ass Dan was getting a proper burial), making Ass Dan 30 years old at the time of this death. The 2011 Columbus Day Assblast on the episode hosted by Ben Stiller implied that Ass Dan was still alive, though he almost suffered a heart attack and still died before he could say that he was going to live forever after the heart attack allegedly passed. On the Bruno Mars episode on October 2012, it's revealed that Ass Dan has an identical twin brother named Butt Dave (also played by Bobby Moynihan).{{episode needed|date=October 2013}}
* Keith, a young movie fan who is excited about everything except for the illustrious actor/host that week, notably snubbing [[Robert De Niro]] in favor of [[Ben Stiller]] on the set of ''[[Little Fockers]]''. In Keith's first appearance, he snubbed a hockey player (played by host [[Bradley Cooper]]).{{episode needed|date=October 2013}}
* Doug, the mechanic for the Merryville Brothers trolley ride. His character was not named on the first sketch with [[Jim Carrey]] as the third Merryville brother.{{episode needed|date=October 2013}}
* Richie, the stage manager from ''The Best of Both Worlds'' who has, on two occasions, been murdered by Julie Andrews and Ice Cube (played by [[Helen Mirren]] and [[Kenan Thompson]] respectively) and by Daniel Radcliffe and Clint Eastwood (also played respectively by Hugh Jackman and [[Bill Hader]]).{{episode needed|date=October 2013}}
* Slappy Pappy, one of the regular comedians in the "Original Kings of Catchphrase Comedy" video series.{{episode needed|date=October 2013}}
* Drunk Uncle, an extremely inebriated and bitter character who drunkenly rants and raves during [[Weekend Update]].{{episode needed|date=October 2013}}
* Janet Peckinpaugh, a middle-aged woman who hooks up with male celebrities (she hooked up with [[Tom Brady]] (as played by Channing Tatum) and Adam Levine as himself.{{episode needed|date=October 2013}}
* Niff, a retail worker who, along with Dana ([[Cecily Strong]]) always insults retail workers whenever they fear they're going to get fired.{{episode needed|date=October 2013}}
