Klugman served in the [[United States Army]] during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="hosted1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_OBIT_KLUGMAN?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&amp;CTIME=2012-12-24-18-11-02|title=Jack Klugman dies at 90|work=Associated Press|accessdate=December 24, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121226210053/http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_OBIT_KLUGMAN?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&amp;CTIME=2012-12-24-18-11-02|archivedate=December 26, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended Carnegie Institute of Technology, now [[Carnegie Mellon University]], in [[Pittsburgh]], graduating in 1948.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; While there, his drama teacher told him, "Young man, you are not suited to be an actor. You are suited to be a truck driver."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=TV Guide. January 7-13, 2013 pg. 8}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, he pursued acting roles while living in New York City with fellow actor [[Charles Bronson]].&lt;ref name="hosted1"/&gt;

==Career==
===1950s and 1960s===
[[File:Jack Klugman Twilight Zone 1963.jpg|thumb|left|Klugman in a publicity photo for ''[[The Twilight Zone]],'' September 1963]]
During the 1950s and 1960s, Klugman was active in numerous stage, television, and film productions.
In 1950, he had a small role in the ''Mr. Roberts'' road company at the [[Colonial Theatre (Boston)|Colonial Theatre]] in Boston. Later that same year, he made his television debut in an episode of ''[[Actors Studio (TV series)|Actors Studio]].'' In March 1952, Klugman made his Broadway debut in ''[[Golden Boy (play)|Golden Boy]],'' as Frank Bonaparte.

In 1954, he played Jim Hanson on the [[soap opera]], ''[[The Greatest Gift (TV series)|The Greatest Gift]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=TV Guide Guide to TV|year=2004|publisher=Barnes and Noble|isbn=0-7607-5634-1|page=264}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, he appeared in the live television broadcast of ''[[Producers' Showcase]],'' in the episode "The Petrified Forest" with [[Humphrey Bogart]] and [[Henry Fonda]]. Klugman later said the experience was the greatest thrill of his career. Klugman went on to star in several classic films, including ''[[12 Angry Men (1957 film)|12 Angry Men]]'' (1957), as juror number five. Of the 12 actors to play a juror in the film, Klugman was the last survivor. In 1959, he returned to Broadway in the original production of ''[[Gypsy: A Musical Fable]].'' In 1960, he was nominated for a [[Tony Award]] for Best Featured Actor (Musical) for his role in the show, but lost to [[Tom Bosley]] in ''[[Fiorello!]].''&lt;ref&gt;''The Tony Award Book'' by Lee Allen Morrow, Abbeville Press, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; He remained with ''Gypsy'' until it closed in March 1961.

From 1960 to 1963, Klugman appeared in four episodes of ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'' series: "[[A Passage for Trumpet]]" (1960), "[[A Game of Pool (1961)|A Game of Pool]]" (1961), "[[Death Ship (The Twilight Zone)|Death Ship]]" (1963), and "[[In Praise of Pip]]" (1963). Klugman tied with [[Burgess Meredith]] for the most appearances in a starring role on the series. In 1964, Klugman won his first [[Primetime Emmy Award]] for his guest starring role on ''[[The Defenders (1961 TV series)|The Defenders]].'' That same year, Klugman landed the starring role in the sitcom ''Harris Against the World.'' The series was a part of an experimental block of sitcoms that aired on [[NBC]] entitled ''[[90 Bristol Court]].'' ''Harris Against the World,'' along with the other sitcoms that aired in the block, were canceled due to low ratings the following year.

Klugman continued the decade with multiple guest roles on television including ''[[The F.B.I. (TV series)|The F.B.I.]],'' ''[[Ben Casey]],'' ''[[The Name of the Game (TV series)|The Name of the Game]],'' and ''[[Insight (TV series)|Insight]].'' He also appeared on Broadway in ''[[Tchin-Tchin]],'' from October 1962 to May 1963.  From 1960 to 1963, Klugman appeared in two episodes of ''[[The Untouchables (1959 TV series)|The Untouchables]]'' series: "Loophole" (1961), and "An Eye for an Eye" (1963).

In 1965, Klugman replaced [[Walter Matthau]] in the lead role of [[Oscar Madison]] in the original [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production of ''[[The Odd Couple (play)|The Odd Couple]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bookrags.com/research/the-odd-couple-sjpc-03/|title=The Odd Couple by Neil Simon (St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture Summary)|accessdate=February 20, 2009|quote=... 1965 play ''The Odd Couple ''and the subsequent 1967 movie, starring Walter Matthau as the sloppy sportswriter Oscar Madison. ... In the television series, Oscar was played by Jack Klugman (who had taken over the role from Matthau on Broadway)...}}&lt;/ref&gt; He reprised the role when the play was adapted as a [[The Odd Couple (1970 TV series)|television series]] which premiered on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in 1970. Over the course of the show's five-year, 114-episode run, Klugman won two Primetime Emmy Awards for his work on the series. The series ended in 1975. In 1973, during the run of the show, Klugman and ''Odd Couple'' co-star Randall recorded an album titled ''The Odd Couple Sings'' for [[London Records]]. [[Roland Shaw]] and [[London Festival Orchestra|The London Festival Orchestra and Chorus]] provided the music and additional vocals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Allmusic|class=album |id=r63924|label=The Odd Couple Sings|first=Jason|last=Ankeny|accessdate=December 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1970s and 1980s===
Following the end of ''The Odd Couple,'' Klugman returned to television in 1976 in ''[[Quincy, M.E.]]'' on [[NBC]]. Klugman portrayed Dr. Quincy, a [[forensic pathology|forensic pathologist]] who worked for the Los Angeles County Coroner's Office and solved crimes. He was nominated for four Primetime Emmy Awards for his work on the series and also wrote four episodes.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} ''Quincy'' aired for a total of 148 episodes over eight seasons, ending in 1983. In 1986, Klugman starred in the sitcom ''[[You Again?]],'' co-starring [[John Stamos]] as Klugman's character's son. The series aired on NBC for two seasons before being canceled.

The following year, he co-starred in the television [[miniseries]] ''[[Around the World in 80 Days (miniseries)|Around the World in 80 Days]]''.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

===1990s to 2010s===
In 1989, Klugman's throat cancer (with which he was first diagnosed in 1974) returned. His illness sidelined his career for the next four years. He returned to acting in a 1993 Broadway revival of ''[[Three Men on a Horse]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vereran actor Jack Klugman dies in Los Angeles|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2012/12/24/jack-klugman-dies/1789879/|work=USA Today|accessdate=December 24, 2012|date=December 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, he reunited with Tony Randall in the television film ''The Odd Couple: Together Again.'' The next year, Klugman co-starred in the television film ''[[Parallel Lives (film)|Parallel Lives]].''
