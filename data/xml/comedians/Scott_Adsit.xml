'''Robert Scott Adsit'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kharakh|first=Ben|url=http://gothamist.com/2007/10/10/scott_adsit_act.php|title=Scott Adsit, Actor, 30 Rock|publisher=Gothamist|date=October 10, 2007|accessdate=October 31, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130709014658/http://gothamist.com/2007/10/10/scott_adsit_act.php|archivedate=July 9, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; (born November 26, 1965) is an American comedian, actor and writer. Born on the [[North Shore (Chicago)|North Shore]] of Illinois, Adsit joined the mainstage cast of [[Chicago]]'s [[The Second City]] in 1994 after attending [[Columbia College Chicago]]. He appeared in several revues, including ''Paradigm Lost'' for which he won The Joseph Jefferson Award for Best Actor in a Comedy.

From 2005–2008, he co-directed, co-wrote and co-produced the [[Adult Swim]] stop-motion animation program ''[[Moral Orel]]'' with [[Dino Stamatopoulos]] and [[Jay Johnston]]. He also voiced several characters and was nominated for an [[Annie Award]] for his work as Clay Puppington, Orel's father. After the success of ''Moral Orel'', Adsit and Stamatopoulos worked together again on their stop-motion animation series ''[[Mary Shelley's Frankenhole]]''. Adult Swim ordered ten episodes for its first season, which began airing June 27, 2010 and was canceled in 2012.

Adsit is known for his role as [[Pete Hornberger]], the well-meaning but jaded executive producer, on the [[NBC]] sitcom ''[[30 Rock]]'', which won a [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series]] in 2008. In 2014, Adsit voiced the robot Baymax in the Disney animated film ''[[Big Hero 6 (film)|Big Hero 6]]''.

==Early life==
Adsit was born in [[Northbrook, Illinois]] on November 26, 1965, the son of Genevieve "Genny" (''née'' Butz) and Andrew Scott Adsit, a real estate attorney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Luc |first1=Karie Angell |title=30 Rock actor, Glenbrook North grad makes appearance at benefit |url=http://northbrook.suntimes.com/people/adsit-NBS-05162013:article |work=Northbrook Star |date=July 15, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110050036/http://northbrook.suntimes.com/people/adsit-NBS-05162013%3Aarticle |archivedate=November 10, 2014 |quote=Adsit, whose mother Genny Adsit still resides in east Northbrook, shook hands with past and current cast members...His father Andrew, a real estate attorney, passed in 2003. |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Andrew Scott Adsit, 69|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2003-12-28/news/0312280259_1_mr-adsit-chicago-firm-sears-tower|accessdate=February 1, 2015|work=Chicago Tribune|date=December 28, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[Glenbrook North High School]], where he recalled being "a bit of a class clown," and attended Indiana's [[DePauw University]] for one semester.&lt;ref name="depauw"&gt;{{cite news|date=November 25, 2009|title=30 Rock's Scott Adsit '88 Featured in Article|url=http://www.depauw.edu/news-media/latest-news/details/24451/|publisher=Depauw University|accessdate=4 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then attended [[Columbia College Chicago]], where acting teacher [[Sheldon Patinkin]] encouraged him to join the city's famed improv troupe, [[The Second City]].&lt;ref name="timeout"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Heidemann|first1=Jason A.|title=Great Scott!|url=http://www.timeout.com/chicago/comedy/great-scott|accessdate=4 April 2015|work=Time Out Chicago|date=November 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===1987–1998===
Adsit joined Second City in 1987,&lt;ref name="depauw"/&gt; and became part of its mainstage cast  in 1994. He appeared in several [[Joseph Jefferson Award]]-winning revues, including ''Piñata Full of Bees'' and ''Paradigm Lost'' for which he won The Jeff Award for Best Actor in a Comedy. A sketch he performed with future ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' head writer [[Adam McKay]], "Gump," was included as one of Second City's all-time best in the theater's 25th anniversary compilation. He appeared in the 1997 [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] documentary about the process of creating the Second City review, Paradigm Lost, ''Second to None'' along with castmates [[Tina Fey]], [[Kevin Dorff]], [[Rachel Dratch]], Jenna Jolovitz and [[Jim Zulevic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.secondcity.com/second-to-none-set-to-air-on-pbs-on-monday/|title=“Second to None” Set to Air on PBS on Monday|website=Second City|accessdate=May 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, he portrayed an alcoholic and drug-addicted father in Minnesota's Hazelden Substance Abuse Clinic short-subject production, ''Reflections From The Heart Of A Child''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://trainwreckdsociety.com/2013/02/02/scott-adsit-interview/|title=Scott Adsit [Interview]|website=Trainwreck'd Society|last=Trembath III|first=Ron|date=February 2, 2013|accessdate=May 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This 26-minute video/DVD feature has become required curriculum in most DWI Repeat Offender classes and substance abuse rehabilitation clinics across the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hazelden.org/OA_HTML/item/10184?Reflections-from-the-Heart-of-a-Child-DVD&amp;src_url=itemquest|title=Reflections from the Heart of a Child DVD|website=Hazelden|accessdate=May 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 1997, Adsit recorded the voices for the King of Payne, Sir Psycho, The Duke of Bourbon, and Merlin for [[WMS Industries|Williams]]' ''[[Medieval Madness]]'' pinball machine. Adsit co-wrote the game's recorded dialog with fellow Second City cast member, Kevin Dorff. Adsit, Dorff and their Second City castmate, Tina Fey, played the character voices in the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Ranking Everything Tina Fey's Ever Done: 18. Medieval Madness Pinball Game|url=http://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2014/04/ranking-everything-tina-feys-ever-done/medieval-madness-pinball-machine|accessdate=4 April 2015|work=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex Magazine]]|date=April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998,  Adsit moved to Los Angeles after an invitation from his college friend [[Dino Stamatopoulos]] to work on a pilot about the backstage antics of a television sketch-comedy variety show. The pilot did not materialize as a show, but Adsit stayed in California and began working in bit parts and commercials.&lt;ref name="timeout"/&gt; That same year, he appeared as a cast member in the renowned [[sketch comedy]] program, ''[[Mr. Show]]''. He also plagued the band [[Tenacious D]] as a neighbor and a demon in their [[HBO]] [[Tenacious D (TV series)|show]].

===2000s===
In 2001, he starred in an episode of ''[[Friends]]'', "[[The One with Ross and Monica's Cousin]]" in Season 7. After moving to [[Los Angeles]], Adsit appeared in several sitcoms and commercials.

From 2005–2008, he co-directed, co-wrote and co-produced the Adult Swim show ''[[Moral Orel]]'' with Stamatopoulos and [[Jay Johnston]]. He also provided the voice of Orel's father, Clay Puppington, as well as his best friend, Doughy, Link McMissins, Art Posabule, Mr. Christein, Junior Christein, Doctor Potterswheel, Billy Figurelli, Mrs. Figurelli and Tiny Tina, among others. He was nominated for an [[Annie Award]] for his work as Clay. Adsit also had a minor role in ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]'' episode "[[Conflict Resolution (The Office)|Conflict Resolution]]" as a photographer. Adsit also had a small role in the movie ''[[Kicking &amp; Screaming (2005 film)|Kicking &amp; Screaming]]'', starring [[Will Ferrell]], where he played the coach of a rival team.

In 2005, he received a call from former Second City castmate [[Tina Fey]]. "Tina called and said, ‘I'm working on a show, and there's a part I'm writing with you in mind, so keep your schedule open next year.' So I did," Adsit recalled in 2009. In a twist of fate, he also auditioned for [[Aaron Sorkin]]’s ''[[Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip]]'', yet another series about the behind-the-scenes drama of a variety show. "My manager said, 'There’s a good possibility you’re going to be offered both of these, so which are you going to go with? You have to tell me now,'" Adsit said. "I said, 'Tina is the lady from ''[[Weekend Update]]'' that riles a lot of people, and Aaron Sorkin just finished ''[[The West Wing]]''; he's the golden boy.'" Ultimately, Adsit picked his friend: "I had to go with somebody I know and respect. I went with Tina."&lt;ref name="timeout"/&gt;

In 2006, he joined the cast of ''[[30 Rock]]'', Fey's show, as [[Pete Hornberger]], a longtime friend of Fey's character, [[Liz Lemon]], and well-meaning but frequently terrified producer of ''[[TGS with Tracy Jordan]]'', a fictitious sketch comedy series.&lt;ref name="rockcasting"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cinemablend.com/television/Interview-Tina-Fey-Talks-About-30-Rock-Part-1-9723.html |title=Interview: Tina Fey Talks About ''30 Rock'' (Part 1) |accessdate=July 8, 2008 |author=West, Kelly|date=April 1, 2008 |publisher=Cinema Blend| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080625085840/http://www.cinemablend.com/television/Interview-Tina-Fey-Talks-About-30-Rock-Part-1-9723.html| archivedate= June 25, 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show ran for seven seasons and was a critical smash, earning [[List of awards and nominations received by 30 Rock|103 Emmy nominations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=30 Rock|url=http://www.emmys.com/shows/30-rock|publisher=Emmy Awards|accessdate=4 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Adsit starred together with [[Brendon Small]] in ''Let's Fish'', a pilot for [[Adult Swim]], but the pilot did not become an official series. Adsit continues to act, improvise and teach at ''[[I.O. West]]'' and the [[Upright Citizens Brigade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sfsketchfest2018.sched.com/speaker/scott_adsit.1xebtxl6|title=Scott Adsit|website=SF Sketchfest|accessdate=February 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010s===
After the success of ''[[Moral Orel]]'', Adsit and [[Dino Stamatopoulos]] started working together again on their newest stop-motion animation series ''[[Mary Shelley's Frankenhole]]'', which [[Adult Swim]] has ordered ten episodes for its first season, which began airing on June 27, 2010. Adsit directed, wrote, produced and provided many of the lead voices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McCarthy|first=Sean L.|url=http://thecomicscomic.com/2009/11/02/scott-adsit-does-not-need-to-read-tracy-morgans-memoir-for-celebrity-autobiography-but-would-he|title=Scott Adsit does not need to read Tracy Morgan’s memoir for Celebrity Autobiography, but would he?|publisher=The Comic's Comic|date=November 2, 2009|accessdate=February 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2010, Adsit hosted a panel featuring comic book writers [[Dan Slott]], [[Frank Tieri (comics)|Frank Tieri]], and [[Chris Claremont]] at HeroCon in Charlotte, North Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;Photo in Dark Avengers Annual 01&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 Adsit was immortalized as an [[SHIELD|Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.]] in the pages of Marvel's ''[[Deadpool]]''. The character, [[Scott Adsit (comics)|Agent Scott Adsit]], has since become a recurring character in the title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scott Adsit (Character)|url=https://www.comicvine.com/scott-adsit/4005-95532/|website=Comic Vine|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=February 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adsit also guest starred as the "Guest [[Bailiff]]" in three episodes of [[John Hodgman]]'s [[podcast]] ''[[Judge John Hodgman]]''.&lt;ref name="Judge John Hodgman 84"&gt;{{cite web|author=MaxFun Intern|url=http://maximumfun.org/judge-john-hodgman/judge-john-hodgman-episode-84-dog-duty|title=Judge John Hodgman Episode 84: Dog Duty|publisher=[[Maximum Fun]]|date=November 14, 2012|accessdate=January 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Judge John Hodgman 91"&gt;{{cite web|author=MaxFun Intern|url=http://maximumfun.org/judge-john-hodgman/judge-john-hodgman-episode-91-coming-out-supply-closet|title=Judge John Hodgman Episode 91: Coming Out of the Supply Closet|publisher=Maximum Fun|date=January 2, 2013|accessdate=January 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Judge John Hodgman 117"&gt;{{cite web|author=Julia Smith|url=http://maximumfun.org/judge-john-hodgman/judge-john-hodgman-episode-117-lawn-and-order|title=Judge John Hodgman Episode 117: Lawn and Order|publisher=Maximum Fun|date=July 3, 2013|accessdate=July 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adsit starred as himself in [[John Hodgman]]'s [[Netflix]] comedy special ''[[John Hodgman: Ragnarok]]''.&lt;ref name="John Hodgman: RAGNAROK - Netflix"&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/70273399?mqso=80033827&amp;opsid=JohnHodmanRagnarok_pp|title=John Hodgman: RAGNAROK|publisher=Netflix|accessdate=June 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He took those boundaries and was able to shape the language in a way that makes you feel Baymax’s emotion and sense of humor. Scott was able to relay just how much Baymax cares."&lt;ref name="USATodayTruitt" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DeadlineMayaJames"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yamato|first1=Jen|title=Maya Rudolph, James Cromwell, More Join Disney’s Marvel Animation ‘Big Hero 6′|url=http://deadline.com/2014/07/disney-big-hero-6-voice-cast-804122/|publisher=Deadline|accessdate=September 5, 2014|date=July 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DeadlineMayaJames" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Baymax|url=https://thismoment-a.akamaihd.net/other/1410708438-2030.pdf|publisher=xprizechallenge.org|accessdate=September 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
