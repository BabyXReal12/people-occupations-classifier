'''Donald David Dixon Ronald O’Connor''' (August 28, 1925 – September 27, 2003) was an American dancer, singer, and actor who came to fame in a series of movies in which he co-starred alternately with [[Gloria Jean]], [[Peggy Ryan]], and [[Francis the Talking Mule]].

He is best known today for his role as Don Lockwood's friend and colleague Cosmo Brown in ''[[Singin' in the Rain]]'' (1952).

==Early years==
Though he considered [[Danville, Illinois]] to be his hometown, O’Connor was born in St. Elizabeth Hospital in [[Chicago]]. His parents, Effie Irene (née Crane) and John Edward "Chuck" O'Connor, were [[vaudeville]] entertainers.&lt;ref name="scribner"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| title=O'Connor, Donald David Dixon Ronald| url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/article-1G2-2875000221/oconnor-donald-david-dixon.html| encyclopedia=Scribner Encyclopedia of American Lives| publisher=Encyclopedia.com| year=2007| accessdate=2012-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Vaudeville, Old and New: An Encyclopedia of Variety Performers in America| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XFnfnKg6BcAC&amp;pg=PA840 | author=Frank Cullen |author2=Florence Hackman |author3=Donald McNeilly| publisher=Routledge| place=New York| date=8 October 2006| isbn=0-415-93853-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father's family was from Ireland.&lt;ref name="current"&gt;{{cite book| title=Current Biography Yearbook, Vol. 16| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_JsYAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=Effie+and+John+Edward+%22Chuck%22+O%27Connor&amp;dq=Effie+and+John+Edward+%22Chuck%22+O%27Connor&amp;hl=en&amp;redir_esc=y| publisher=H.W. Wilson Co.| year=1955| accessdate=2012-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; When O'Connor was only two years old, he and his sister Arlene, who was seven at the time, were in a car crash outside a theater in [[Hartford, Connecticut]]; O'Connor survived, but his sister did not. A few weeks later, his father died of a heart attack while dancing on stage in [[Brockton, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name=severo&gt;{{cite news|title=Donald O'Connor, 78, Who Danced His Way Through Many Hollywood Musicals, Is Dead| author=Richard Severo|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20716FD3A590C7A8EDDA00894DB404482| work=[[The New York Times]] |date=29 September 2003| publisher=NYTimes.com| accessdate=2012-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
O'Connor began performing in movies in 1937, making his debut aged 11 in Columbia's ''[[It Can't Last Forever]]'' (1937).

===Paramount===
O'Connor signed a contract at Paramount. He appeared in ''[[Men with Wings]]'' (1938) as [[Fred MacMurray]]'s character as a boy, and in ''[[Sing You Sinners (film)|Sing You Sinners]]'' (1938) as [[Bing Crosby]]'s younger brother.

He was in ''[[Sons of the Legion]]'' (1938), then had the lead in a [[B-picture]], ''[[Tom Sawyer, Detective (film)|Tom Sawyer, Detective]]'' (1938), playing [[Huckleberry Finn]]. O'Connor was in ''[[Boy Trouble]]'' (1939) and played John Hartley as a young boy in ''[[Unmarried (1939 film)|Unmarried]]'' (1939).

O'Connor was billed fourth in ''[[Million Dollar Legs (1939 film)|Million Dollar Legs]]'' (1939) with [[Betty Grable]] and played [[Gary Cooper]] as a young boy in ''[[Beau Geste (1939 film)|Beau Geste]]'' (1939). ''[[Night Work (film)|Night Work]]'' (1939) was a sequel to ''Boy Trouble'' and he was in ''[[Death of a Champion]]'' (1939).&lt;ref name=severo/&gt;

In 1940, when he had outgrown child roles, he returned to vaudeville.

===Universal===
In 1941, O’Connor signed with [[Universal Pictures]], where he began by appearing in seven B-picture musicals in a row, starting with ''[[What's Cookin'?]]'' (1942) with [[The Andrews Sisters]], [[Gloria Jean]] and [[Peggy Ryan]].&lt;ref&gt;Zylstra, Freida. (July 25, 1950) "Chicago Born Donald O'Connor Is a Veteran of Stage and Films at 25" ''[[Chicago Daily Tribune]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  He and Ryan were in ''[[Private Buckaroo]]'' (1942) and ''[[Give Out, Sisters]]'' (1942), both with the Andrews Sisters.

He, Ryan and Jean were in ''[[Get Hep to Love]]'' (1942) and ''[[When Johnny Comes Marching Home (film)|When Johnny Comes Marching Home]]'' (1942). He made ''[[It Comes Up Love]]'' (1942) with Jean but without Ryan.

==="A" Films===
O'Connor, Jean and Ryan were in ''[[Mister Big (1943 film)|Mister Big]]'' (1943). Before this film was released, O’Connor’s popularity soared.  Universal added $50,000 in musical numbers to the film and promoted the "B" movie to "A" status.
[[File:Donald O'Connor (handprints in cement).jpg|thumb|left|267px|The handprints of Donald O'Connor in front of [[The Great Movie Ride]] at [[Walt Disney World]]'s [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]] theme park]]
O'Connor and Ryan were in ''[[Top Man (film)|Top Man]]'' (1943) and ''[[Chip Off the Old Block]]'' (1944). They both had cameos in Universal's all-star ''[[Follow the Boys]]'' (1944).

On his 18th birthday in August 1943, during [[World War II]] O'Connor was drafted into the [[United States Army]].  Before he reported for induction on February 6, 1944, Universal already had four O’Connor films completed. They rushed production to complete four more by that date, all with Ryan: ''[[This Is the Life (1944 film)|This Is the Life]]'' (1944), ''[[The Merry Monahans]]'' (1944), ''[[Bowery to Broadway]]'' (1945) and ''[[Patrick the Great]]'' (1945).

With a backlog of seven features, deferred openings kept O’Connor’s screen presence uninterrupted during the two years he was overseas.

===Return from War Service===
Upon his return, a merger in 1946 had reorganized the studio as Universal-International. The studio paired O'Connor opposite their biggest female star, [[Deanna Durbin]], in ''[[Something in the Wind]]'' (1947). He starred in ''[[Are You with It?]]'' (1948), ''[[Feudin', Fussin' and A-Fightin']]'' (1949), and ''[[Yes Sir, That's My Baby (film)|Yes Sir, That's My Baby]]'' (1949).

===''Francis''===
In 1949, he played the lead role in ''[[Francis (1950 film)|Francis]]'', the story of a soldier befriended by a talking mule. The film was a huge success. As a consequence, his musical career was constantly interrupted by production of one ''Francis'' film per year until 1955. O'Connor later said the films "were fun to make. Actually, they were quite challenging. I had to play straight in order to convince the audience that the mule could talk."&lt;ref&gt;Donald O'Connor's musical Journey keeps him on road
Dale, Steve. Chicago Tribune (1963-Current file) [Chicago, Ill] 20 Dec 1985: n_a50.&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Connor followed the first ''Francis'' with comedies: ''[[Curtain Call at Cactus Creek]]'' (1950), ''[[The Milkman]]'' (1950), ''[[Double Crossbones]]'' (1951). He did ''[[Francis Goes to the Races]]'' (1951), another big hit.

===''Singin' in the Rain''===
O'Connor then received an offer to play Cosmo the piano player in ''[[Singin' in the Rain]]'' (1952) at MGM. This earned him a [[Golden Globe Award]] for Best Performance by an Actor in a Comedy or Musical. The film featured his widely known rendition of "[[Make 'Em Laugh]]". O'Connor said he smoked around 4 packs of cigarettes a day during filming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eviltwinltd.com/muppetlabs/oconnor/donald.htm|title=Donald O'Connor Web Site|first=Teresa and Tracy Ann Murray, T 'n'|last=T|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952 O'Connor signed a three-picture deal with Paramount.&lt;ref&gt;PARAMOUNT SIGNS DONALD O'CONNOR: Actor Will Make 3 Pictures for Studio -- Betty Hutton's Film May Be One of Them By THOMAS M. PRYOR Special to THE NEW YORK TIMES.. New York Times (1923-Current file) [New York, N.Y] 24 Jan 1952: 23.&lt;/ref&gt; He went back to Universal for ''[[Francis Goes to West Point]]'' (1952) then returned to MGM for ''[[I Love Melvin]]'' (1953) a musical with [[Debbie Reynolds]].

He supported [[Ethel Merman]] in ''[[Call Me Madam (film)|Call Me Madam]]'' (1953) at [[20th Century Fox]], later saying the film contained his best dancing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://danceviewtimes.com/dvny/features/2003/o'connor.html|title=Donald O'Connor interview - Mindy Aloff|publisher=|accessdate=March 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After ''[[Francis Covers the Big Town]]'' (1953), Universal put O'Connor in a musical in colour, ''[[Walking My Baby Back Home (film)|Walking My Baby Back Home]]'' (1953). He did ''[[Francis Joins the WACS]]'' (1954) then played Tim Donahue in the [[20th Century Fox]] musical ''[[There's No Business Like Show Business]]'' (1954), which featured [[Irving Berlin]]'s music and also starred with [[Ethel Merman]], [[Marilyn Monroe]], [[Dan Dailey]], [[Mitzi Gaynor]] and [[Johnnie Ray]].

It was because of the ''Francis'' series that O'Connor missed playing Bing Crosby's partner in ''[[White Christmas (film)|White Christmas]]'' (1954). O'Connor was unavailable because he contracted an illness transmitted by the mule, and was replaced in the film by [[Danny Kaye]].

He starred in ''[[The Donald O'Connor Show]]'' (1954–55) for one season. O'Connor was a regular host of [[NBC]]'s ''[[Colgate Comedy Hour]]''.&lt;ref name=severo/&gt;

O'Connor was reluctant to keep making ''Francis'' films but agreed to ''[[Francis in the Navy]]'' (1955).&lt;ref&gt;Donald O'Connor Scheduled for Another 'Francis' Film
Hopper, Hedda. Chicago Daily Tribune (1923-1963) [Chicago, Ill] 18 Oct 1954: b16.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arthur Lubin]] who directed the films later recalled that O'Connor "got very difficult" to work with after a while. "He started drinking and I think he had problems at home. He started swearing at me and being late on set."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Ronald L.|page=183|title=Just Making Movies|year=2005|publisher=University Press of Mississippi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Connor and Crosby united on ''[[Anything Goes (1956 film)|Anything Goes]]'' (1956) at Paramount. That studio also released ''[[The Buster Keaton Story]]'' (1957), in which O'Connor had the title role. He hosted a color television special on NBC in 1957, one of the earliest color programs to be preserved on a color [[kinescope]]; an excerpt of the telecast was included in NBC's 50th anniversary special in 1976.

===1960s films===
O'Connor teamed with [[Glenn Ford]] in ''[[Cry for Happy]]'' (1961) and played the title role in ''[[The Wonders of Aladdin]]'' (1961). He subsequently focused on theatre work then returned to films in the [[Sandra Dee]] comedy ''[[That Funny Feeling]]'' (1965).

In 1968, O'Connor hosted a [[Television syndication|syndicated]] [[talk show]] also called ''The Donald O'Connor Show''.&lt;ref&gt;Alex McNeil, ''Total Television'', p. 231&lt;/ref&gt; He suffered a [[heart attack]] in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.things-and-other-stuff.com/movies/profiles/donald-oconnor.html|title=Donald O'Connor by Susan M. Kelly|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1970s===
O'Connor overcame [[alcoholism]] after being hospitalized for three months after collapsing in 1978.&lt;ref name=severo/&gt; His career had a boost when he hosted the [[Academy Awards]], which earned him two [[Primetime Emmy]] nominations. He appeared as a gaslight-era entertainer in the 1981 film ''[[Ragtime (film)|Ragtime]]'', notable for similar encore performances by [[James Cagney]] and [[Pat O'Brien (actor)|Pat O'Brien]]. It was his first feature film role in 16 years.

O'Connor appeared in the short-lived ''[[Bring Back Birdie]]'' on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in 1981 and continued to make film and television appearances into the 1990s, including the [[Robin Williams]] film ''[[Toys (film)|Toys]]'' as the president of a toy-making company. He had guest roles in 1996 in a pair of popular TV comedy series, ''[[The Nanny]]'' and ''[[Frasier]]''.

In 1998, he received a Golden Palm Star on the [[Palm Springs, California]], [[Palm Springs Walk of Stars|Walk of Stars]].&lt;ref name="stars"&gt;{{cite web| title=Palm Spring Walk of Stars| url=http://www.palmsprings.com/stars/| publisher=PalmSprings.com| accessdate=2012-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Connor's last feature film was the [[Jack Lemmon]]-[[Walter Matthau]] comedy ''[[Out to Sea]]'', in which he played a dance host on a cruise ship. O’Connor was still making public appearances well into 2003.

The most distinctive characteristic of O'Connor's dancing style was its athleticism, for which he had few rivals.  Yet it was his boyish charm that audiences found most engaging, and which remained an appealing aspect of his personality throughout his career.  In his early Universal films, O'Connor closely mimicked the smart alec, fast-talking personality of [[Mickey Rooney]] of rival MGM Studio.  For ''[[Singin' in the Rain]]'', however, MGM cultivated a much more sympathetic sidekick persona, and that remained O'Connor's signature image. {{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

==Personal life==
O'Connor was married twice and had four children. His first marriage was in 1944 to Gwendolyn Carter, with whom he had a daughter, Donna. The couple divorced in 1954. He married for a second time, to Gloria Noble, in 1956. Together they had three children: Alicia, Donald Frederick, and Kevin. O'Connor and Noble were married until his death in 2003.&lt;ref name=severo/&gt;

==Death==
O'Connor had undergone quadruple heart bypass surgery in 1990,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.philly.com/2003-09-28/news/25457720_1_donald-o-connor-vaudeville-alicia-o-connor|title=Archives - Philly.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he nearly died from double [[pneumonia]] in January 1998. He died from complications of [[heart failure]] on September 27, 2003, at age 78 at the [[Motion Picture &amp; Television Country House and Hospital]], in [[Woodland Hills, Los Angeles|Woodland Hills]], California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/sep/28/local/me-oconnor28|title=Donald O'Connor, 78; Entertainer Immortalized by 'Singin' in the Rain'|last=Welkos|first=Robert W.|date=2003-09-28|publisher=latimes.com|accessdate=12 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His remains were cremated and buried at the [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills)|Forest Lawn–Hollywood Hills Cemetery]] in [[Los Angeles]].
