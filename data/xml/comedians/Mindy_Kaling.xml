Vera Mindy Chokalingam was born in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], to father Avu Chokalingam, an [[architect]], and mother Swati Chokalingam, an [[Obstetrics and gynaecology|obstetrician/gynecologist]] (OB/GYN).&lt;ref name="Parade"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://parade.com/167806/shawnamalcom/thoroughly-modern-mindy-kalings-house-rules|title=Thoroughly Modern Mindy Kaling|date=September 28, 2013|accessdate=August 15, 2017|first=Shawna|last=Malcolm|work=[[Parade (magazine)|Parade]]|archivedate=April 17, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417081001/http://parade.com/167806/shawnamalcom/thoroughly-modern-mindy-kalings-house-rules|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BostonGlobe-TMP-20122"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2012/09/24/cambridge-native-mindy-kaling-was-inspired-mother-for-new-passion-project/L1g1S1TFZdYNETPGrsIddM/story.html|title=Mindy Kaling's mother inspired new TV 'Project'|last=Rodman|first=Sarah|date=September 25, 2012|work=[[Boston Globe]]|accessdate=March 8, 2014|archivedate=March 9, 2014|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20140309053053/http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2012/09/24/cambridge-native-mindy-kaling-was-inspired-mother-for-new-passion-project/L1g1S1TFZdYNETPGrsIddM/story.html|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kaling's parents are from [[India]],&lt;ref name="Jezebel-Q&amp;A-20112"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://jezebel.com/5861783/interview-with-mindy-kaling|title=Mindy Kaling Visits Jezebel, Takes Your Questions|date=December 12, 2011|work=[[Jezebel (website)|Jezebel]]|last1=Coen|first1=Jessica|accessdate=January 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and met while working at the same hospital in [[Nigeria]].

The family immigrated to the United States in 1979, the same year Kaling was born.&lt;ref name="NYTimes-Office-20112"/&gt; Kaling's mother died of [[pancreatic cancer]] in 2012.&lt;ref name="BostonGlobe-Mom-Obit-20122"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/bostonglobe/obituary.aspx?pid=155735053|title=Swati Chokalingam M.D.: Obituary|date=February 2, 2012|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|accessdate=January 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FamilySearch-SSDI-20122"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:KM8B-CQJ|title=Swati Chokalingam - United States Social Security Death Index|publisher=FamilySearch|accessdate=January 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="People-MomLove-20132"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20754609,00.html|title=Mindy Kaling: My Late Mom 'Was the Love of My Life'|last=Cosgrove Baylis|first=Shelia|date=November 12, 2013|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]|accessdate=March 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kaling has one sibling, a brother, Vijay Jojo Chokal-Ingam (an educational consultant).

Kaling has said she has never been called Vera, her first name,&lt;ref name="ImproperBost-Office-20112"/&gt; but has been referred to as Mindy since her mother was pregnant with her while her parents were living in [[Nigeria]]. They were already planning to move to the United States and wanted, Kaling said, a "cute American name" for their daughter, and liked the name Mindy from the TV&amp;nbsp;show ''[[Mork &amp; Mindy]]''. The name Vera is, according to Kaling, the name of the "incarnation of a [[Hindu]] goddess."&lt;ref name="ImproperBost-Office-20112"/&gt; Kaling graduated from [[Buckingham Browne &amp; Nichols]], a private school in Cambridge, in 1997. The following year, she entered [[Dartmouth College]], where she was a member of the improvisational comedy troupe The Dog Day Players and the [[a cappella]] group The Rockapellas, was the creator of the comic strip ''Badly Drawn Girl'' in ''[[The Dartmouth]]'' (the college's daily newspaper), and was a writer for the ''[[Dartmouth Jack-O-Lantern]]'' (the college's humor magazine).{{cn|date=April 2018}}

Kaling graduated from Dartmouth in 2001&lt;ref name="Dartmouth-Graduation-20012"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thedartmouth.com/2001/06/10/list-of-graduates|title=List of Graduates|date=June 10, 2001|work=[[The Dartmouth]]|quote=As "Vera Chokalingam"|last1=Dartmouth Staff|accessdate=January 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a bachelor's degree in playwriting.&lt;ref name="Dartmouth-Office-20062"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedartmouth.com/2006/05/23/kaling-01-embarks-on-acting-writing-career-for-the-office|title=Kaling '01 embarks on acting, writing career for ‘The Office’|date=May 23, 2006|work=The Dartmouth|last1=Swiss|first1=Zach|accessdate=January 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was a [[classics]] major for much of college and studied Latin, a subject she has been learning since the seventh grade.&lt;ref name="WTF-Maron-20122"/&gt;

== Career ==
While a 19-year-old sophomore at Dartmouth, Kaling was an intern on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]''.&lt;ref name="YouTube-Conan-Intern-20122"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7f-R5ipL30|title=Mindy Kaling Was A Conan Intern - CONAN on TBS|date=November 7, 2012|publisher=''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]''[[YouTube]] channel|format=Video interview|last1=O'Brien|first1=Conan|accessdate=January 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kaling said she was a terrible intern, "less of a 'make copies' intern and more of a 'stalk Conan' intern."&lt;ref name="YouTube-Conan-Intern-20122" /&gt; Kaling has said that she never saw a family like hers on TV, which gave her a dual perspective she uses in her writing.&lt;ref name="NPR-Immigrants-20092"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=102572670|title=On TV, Immigrants' Kids Mine Cultural Convergence|authorlink=Neda Ulaby|last=Ulaby|first=Neda|date=February 4, 2009|publisher=[[NPR]]|work=[[Morning Edition]]|accessdate=February 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She thinks the "everyone against me mentality" is what she learned as a child of immigrants.&lt;ref name="NPR-Immigrants-20092" /&gt; She named her ''Mindy Project'' character [[The Mindy Project|Mindy Lahiri]] after author [[Jhumpa Lahiri]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.time.com/2013/07/01/authors-share-their-all-time-favorite-summer-reads/slide/mindy-kaling|title=Authors share their all-time favorite summer reads|date=June 28, 2013|access-date=February 20, 2015 |magazine= Time| first= Mindy| last= Kaling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After college, Kaling moved to [[Brooklyn, New York]].&lt;ref name="NYTimes-Office-20112" /&gt; Kaling said one of her worst job experiences was as a production assistant for three months on the ''Crossing Over With [[John Edward]]'' psychic show.&lt;ref name="ImproperBost-Office-20112"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theoffice-us.livejournal.com/1322768.html|title=Mindy Kaling interview in Improper Bostonian|last=Soroff|first=Jonathan|work=[[The Improper Bostonian]]|accessdate=September 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She described it as "depressing."&lt;ref name="AVClub-Office-20072"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/mindy-kaling-14079|title=Mindy Kaling - Interview| date=April 4, 2007|work=[[The A.V.

Kaling devised her stage name after discovering while doing stand-up comedy that emcees would have trouble pronouncing her last name, Chokalingam, and sometimes made jokes about it.&lt;ref name="NPR-Immigrants-20092" /&gt; She toured solo as well as with [[Craig Robinson (actor)|Craig Robinson]] before he was on ''The Office.''&lt;ref name="WTF-Maron-20122" /&gt;

In August 2002, Kaling portrayed [[Ben Affleck]] in an [[off Broadway|off-Broadway]] play called ''Matt &amp; Ben'',&lt;ref name="NYTimes-BaM-Review-20032"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/mem/theater/treview.html?res=9b07e2d81031f931a2575bc0a9659c8b63|title=Theater Review; Bad Will Hunting, Armed With Venom Darts|date=August 12, 2003|work=[[The New York Times]]| last1= Weber| first1= Bruce| accessdate= January 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which she co-wrote with her best friend from college, Brenda Withers—who played [[Matt Damon]]. The play was named one of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's "Top Ten Theatrical Events of The Year" and was "a surprise hit" at the 2002 [[New York International Fringe Festival]].&lt;ref name="NYTimes-Office-20112" /&gt; Initially, Withers and Kaling had, "for their own entertainment, mockingly pretended to be the best friends Matt Damon and Ben Affleck; that pretending spawned ''Matt &amp; Ben'', the goofy play that reimagined how Damon and Affleck came to write the movie ''[[Good Will Hunting]]''."&lt;ref name="NYTimes-Office-20112" /&gt;

Kaling wrote a blog, ''Things I've Bought That I Love'',&lt;ref name="NYTimes-Office-20112" /&gt; which reemerged on her website on September 29, 2011.&lt;ref name="OngoingConcerns-20122"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theconcernsofmindykaling.com/ongoing-concerns| title= Ongoing Concerns| date= January 27, 2012|publisher=The Concerns of Mindy Kaling| format= Blog| last1= Kaling| first1= Mindy| accessdate=January 28, 2015| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306085304/http://theconcernsofmindykaling.com/ongoing-concerns| archivedate= March 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The blog was written under the name Mindy Ephron, "a name Kaling chose because she was amused by the idea of her 20-something Indian-American self as a long-lost [[Nora Ephron|Ephron]] sister."&lt;ref name="NYTimes-Office-20112" /&gt;

=== ''The Office'' ===
{{Main|The Office (U.S. TV series)}}[[File:MindyKaling08.jpg|thumb|Kaling in 2008|left|237x237px]]
In 2004, when ''The Office'' producer [[Greg Daniels]] was working to adapt ''The Office'' from the [[BBC]] TV series of the same name, he hired Kaling as a writer-performer after reading a [[spec script]] she wrote. He said, "She's very original ... If anything feels phony or lazy or passé, she’ll pounce on it."&lt;ref name="NYTimes-Office-20112" /&gt;

When Kaling joined ''The Office'', she was 24 years old and was the only woman on a staff of eight.&lt;ref name="NYTimes-Office-20112" /&gt; She took on the role of character [[Kelly Kapoor]], debuting in the series’s second episode, "Diversity Day."&lt;ref name="Dartmouth-Office-20062" /&gt;

In a 2007 interview with ''[[The A.V. Club]]'', she stated that Kelly is "an exaggerated version of what I think the upper-level writers believe my personality is."&lt;ref name="AVClub-Office-20072" /&gt; 

Kaling directed ''The Office'' webisode ''The 3rd&amp;nbsp;Floor''.&lt;ref name="OfficeTally-Webisodes-20102"&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.officetally.com/the-office-webisodes-the-3rd-floor|title=The Office Webisodes: The 3rd Floor|date=November 5, 2010| work= OfficeTally.com| accessdate=January 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She directed the [[The Office (U.S. season 6)|Season&amp;nbsp;6]] episode titled "[[Body Language (The Office)|Body Language]]," which marked her television directorial debut. Her contract was set to expire at the end of Season 7. On September 15, 2011, she signed a new contract to stay with the show for Season 8 and was promoted to full executive producer.&lt;ref name="TVLine-Office-20112"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvline.com/2011/09/mindy-kaling-office-contract-promotion-exec-producer|title=Scoop: Mindy Kaling Gets Major Office Promotion&amp;nbsp;— But There's a Twist!|last=Ausiello|first=Michael|date=September 15, 2011|work=[[TVLine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her [[Universal Television]] contract included a development deal for a new show (eventually titled ''The Mindy Project''), in which she appears as an actress and contributes as a writer.&lt;ref name="NYTimes-Office-20112" /&gt;

Kaling and her fellow writers and producers of ''The Office'' were nominated five consecutive times for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series. In 2010, she received a nomination for Outstanding Writing in a Comedy Series with Daniels for the episode, "Niagara."&lt;ref name="Time100-20132"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://time100.time.com/2013/04/18/time-100/slide/mindy-kaling|title=The 2013 Time 100 - Mindy Kaling: Comedian and creator, 33|last=Helms|first=Ed|date=April 13, 2013|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
