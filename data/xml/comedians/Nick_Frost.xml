'''Nicholas John Frost''' (born 28 March 1972) is an English actor, comedian, screenwriter, producer, and author. He is best known for his work in the [[Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy|''Three Flavours Cornetto'' trilogy]] of films, consisting of ''[[Shaun of the Dead]]'' (2004), ''[[Hot Fuzz]]'' (2007), and ''[[The World's End (film)|The World's End]]'' (2013), and the television comedy ''[[Spaced]]'' (1999–2001). He also appeared in [[Joe Cornish]]'s film ''[[Attack the Block]]'' (2011). He co-starred in the 2011 film ''[[Paul (film)|Paul]]'', which he co-wrote with frequent collaborator and best friend [[Simon Pegg]]. He is also well known for his various roles in the sketch show ''[[Man Stroke Woman]]''.

==Early life==
Frost was born in [[Dagenham]], [[London]], the son of Tricia (d. 2005)&lt;ref name=Forsyth&gt;{{BBC programmes|p0356wv1|BBC Scotland - The Janice Forsyth Show - Nick Frost 2015 interview with Edi Stark}}&lt;/ref&gt; and John Frost, office furniture designers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/nick-frost-being-funny-is-like-a-six-pack-for-a-fat-man-6471641.html|title=Nick Frost: Being funny is like a six-pack for a fat man|work=The Evening Standard|date=20 May 2010|accessdate=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/the-filter/nick-frost-i-dont-laugh-as-much-anymore/|author=India Sturgis|title=Nick Frost: 'I don't laugh as much anymore'|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=4 April 2016|accessdate=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he was ten, his sister died of an asthma attack aged 18.&lt;ref name=guard-int&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/may/04/nick-frost-interview-sitcom-mr-sloane|author=Day, Elizabeth|title=Nick Frost: the film funnyman on fame, fatherhood and a painful past|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|date=4 May 2014|accessdate=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[Beal High School]] in [[Ilford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/person/394251/Nick-Frost/biography|title=Nick Frost|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150526153158/https://www.nytimes.com/movies/person/394251/Nick-Frost/biography|archivedate=26 May 2015|deadurl=yes|accessdate=26 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Frost was 15 his parents' business failed and they lost the family home. They moved in with neighbours where he witnessed his mother having a stroke due to the stress. Frost left school and took a job with a shipping company to support the family. He subsequently spent two years at a [[kibbutz]] in Israel. He met actor [[Simon Pegg]] while working as a waiter at a [[North London]] Mexican restaurant and the two became close friends and flatmates. Pegg and [[Jessica Hynes]] wrote a role for Frost in the cult [[slacker]] comedy series ''[[Spaced]]'' that was partly based on Pegg and Frost's lifestyle at the time.&lt;ref name=guard-int/&gt;

==Career==
He appeared in corporate training [[video clips]] such as ''Chris Carter and the Coverplan Challenge'', a [[Dixons Group|Dixons]] sales video, before gaining fame as Tim's army-obsessed best friend Mike in ''Spaced'' (1999–2001), which aired on [[Channel 4]] for two series. In 2001, Frost played a small role in a one-off episode of [[Victoria Wood]]'s ''[[Acorn Antiques]]''. This was a specially written episode shown during the series called "The Sketch Show Story" that Victoria narrated, in which Frost played an armed robber who shot dead Acorn Antiques' most lovable character, [[Mrs Overall]].

In 2002, Frost wrote and [[Television presenter|presented]] the show ''[[Danger! 50,000 Volts!]]'', a spoof of the outdoors survival genre in which [[Special Air Service|SAS]] experts or the like demonstrated how to improvise solutions to dangerous problems. In the same year, Frost co-wrote and starred in ''[[The Sofa of Time]]'' with [[Matt King (comedian)|Matt King]]. In 2004, he appeared in ''[[Shaun of the Dead]]'', a "romantic zombie comedy", written by Simon Pegg and ''Spaced'' director [[Edgar Wright]]. In late 2005, Frost starred in the comedy sketch show ''[[Man Stroke Woman]]'' on [[BBC Three]]. A second series of ''[[Man Stroke Woman]]'' aired on [[BBC Three]] in early 2007. In early 2006, Frost played Commander Henderson in two series of the [[BBC Two]] science fiction sitcom, ''[[Hyperdrive (BBC TV)|Hyperdrive]]''. Also in 2006, he acted in ''[[Kinky Boots (film)|Kinky Boots]]''. Frost had a small appearance in the British comedy ''[[Look Around You]]'', a parody of 1970s/1980s technology parodying the format of shows like ''[[Tomorrow's World]]''.

Frost and Pegg appeared in a second Pegg-Wright feature film called ''[[Hot Fuzz]]'', an action and cop genre homage, set in [[Gloucestershire]]. Frost plays bumbling Constable Danny Butterman, who partners up with Pegg's dynamic Nicholas Angel after the latter is transferred from the [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]] in London. The pair teamed up again for their self-penned 2011 science-fiction comedy film ''[[Paul (film)|Paul]]'', whose storyline concerned a fugitive alien. The two also starred in [[Steven Spielberg]]'s ''[[The Adventures of Tintin: Secret of the Unicorn]]'' as [[Thomson and Thompson]]. Frost narrates the [[Channel 4]] reality show ''[[Supernanny]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Gilsdorf, Ethan|title=Q&amp;A With Nick Frost and Simon Pegg: Pockets of 'Us-es' Everywhere|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|url=https://www.wired.com/2011/03/qa-with-nick-frost-and-simon-pegg/|date=18 March 2011|accessdate=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has made fleeting appearances in the Channel 4 surreal medical comedy series ''[[Green Wing]]'' as "just a man" in pub scenes (when [[Boyce (Green Wing)|Boyce]] asks who he is, he responds, "just a man"). In 2013, Frost played the role of Andy Knightley in the third Pegg-Wright feature film called ''[[The World's End (film)|The World's End]]''. In 2014, he played the eponymous character in the [[Sky Atlantic]] comedy, ''[[Mr. Sloane]]''.

In 2016, Frost was cast in an ensemble role for the second season of the [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] television series, ''[[Into the Badlands (TV series)|Into the Badlands]]''.&lt;ref name="Badlands1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2016/08/into-the-badlands-casts-nick-frost-as-series-regular-amc-1201806226/|title=‘Into The Badlands’ Casts Nick Frost As Series Regular|author=Petski, Denise|date=19 August 2016|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|accessdate=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Frost is best friends with fellow actor [[Simon Pegg]] and the two have appeared alongside each other in several films. In a 2005 interview, Frost stated that he was brought up as a [[Catholic]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Night of the Laughing Dead: An Interview With ''Shaun of the Dead'' Writer/Actor Simon Pegg And Co-Star Nick Frost|publisher=dvdverdict.com|url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/interviews/shaundead.php|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724121337/http://www.dvdverdict.com/interviews/shaundead.php|deadurl=yes|archivedate=24 July 2008|author=Naugle, Patrick|date=14 February 2005|accessdate=29 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but is now an [[Atheism|atheist]], as is Simon Pegg. He is a supporter of [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]], as well as being a rugby player, formerly playing for [[Barking Rugby Football Club|Barking RFC]].

Frost lived with his half-[[Swedish people|Swedish]] wife, production executive Christina,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/nick-frost-ill-do-anything-for-money-1977360.html|location=London|work=The Independent|title=Nick Frost: 'I'll do anything for ''Money'''|date=23 May 2010|accessdate=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[St Margarets, London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2005/10/25/ign-interviews-nick-frost?page=4|title=IGN Interviews Nick Frost|date=25 October 2005|accessdate=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; They married in 2008. He previously lived in [[Finsbury Park, London|Finsbury Park]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Edinburgh Fringe|Fringe Comedy Awards Interview]] Retrieved 8 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; which was also the filming location for ''[[Shaun of the Dead]]''. On 22 June 2011, Christina gave birth to the couple's son. They separated in 2013,&lt;ref name=Forsyth/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/10173588/Nick-Frost-Its-about-time-I-showed-off-my-smokingly-hot-side.html|title=Nick Frost: 'It's about time I showed off my smokingly hot side'|date=18 July 2013|author=Husband, Stuart|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later divorced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sturgis, India|title=Nick Frost: 'I don't laugh as much anymore'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/the-filter/nick-frost-i-dont-laugh-as-much-anymore/|work=The Daily Telegraph|publisher=Telegraph Media Group, Ltd.|accessdate=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2015, Frost released a memoir titled ''Truths, Half Truths &amp; Little White Lies'' ([[Hodder &amp; Stoughton]]), detailing his life up to the age of 30.&lt;ref name=extract&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global|title=The Guardian|author=Frost, Nick|work=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian Media Group}} {{Dead link|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
