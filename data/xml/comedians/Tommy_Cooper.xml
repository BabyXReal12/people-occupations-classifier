'''Thomas Frederick Cooper''' (19 March 1921 – 15 April 1984) was a British [[prop comedian]] and [[Magic (illusion)|magician]]. He was a member of [[the Magic Circle]], and was respected by traditional magicians. He habitually wore a red [[fez]], and his appearance was large and lumbering, at {{convert|6|ft|4|in|m}} and more than {{convert|15|st|lb kg}} in weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| newspaper=[[The Times]] | title=Obituary: Tommy Cooper | date=17 April 1984 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 April 1984, Cooper collapsed with  a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] on live national television, and died soon afterwards.

==Early life==
Thomas Frederick Cooper was born on 19 March 1921 at 19 Llwyn-On Street in [[Caerphilly]], Glamorgan.&lt;ref name="exmem"&gt;{{citation |title=Tommy Cooper |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112114320/http://www.exetermemories.co.uk/em/_people/cooper.php |url=http://www.exetermemories.co.uk/em/_people/cooper.php |archive-date=2012-01-12 |work=www.exetermemories.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was delivered by the woman who owned the house in which the family were lodging. His parents were Thomas H. Cooper, a [[Welsh people|Welsh]] recruiting sergeant in the [[British Army]] and later coal miner, and Catherine Gertrude (''née'' Wright), Thomas' [[English people|English]] wife from [[Crediton]], [[Devon]].&lt;ref name="exmem" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;GRO Register of Marriages: Dec 1919 11a 1538 Pontypridd – Thomas H. Cooper = Gertrude C. Wright.&lt;/ref&gt;

To escape from the heavily polluted air of Caerphilly, his father accepted the offer of a new job and the family moved to [[Exeter]], Devon, when Cooper was three. It was in Exeter that he acquired the [[West Country English|West Country accent]] that became part of his act.&lt;ref name="BBC1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/nolpda/ukfs_news/hi/newsid_3625000/3625301.stm |title=Home |publisher=BBC News |date= |accessdate=2015-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he was eight, an aunt bought him a magic set and he spent hours perfecting the tricks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biographyonline.net/comics/tommy-cooper.html |title=Tommy Cooper – Biography |publisher=Biographyonline.net |date= |accessdate=20 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s, his brother David (born 1930&lt;!-- alive or dead? --&gt;)&lt;ref&gt;GRO Register of Births: Se 1930 5b 60 St Thomas – David J. Cooper, mmn – Wright&lt;/ref&gt; opened a magic shop called D. &amp; Z. Cooper's Magic Shop on the high street in [[Slough]], [[Berkshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/manchester/content/articles/2005/06/07/100_club_norman_43_feature.shtm|title=BBC - Error 404 : Not Found|publisher=|accessdate=26 August 2016}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After school, Cooper became a [[shipwright]] in [[Southampton]]. In 1940, he was called up as a [[Trooper (rank)|trooper]] in the [[Royal Horse Guards]], serving for seven years. He joined [[Bernard Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Montgomery]]'s [[7th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|Desert Rats]] in Egypt. Cooper became a member of a [[NAAFI]] entertainment party and developed an act around his [[Magic (illusion)|magic tricks]] interspersed with comedy. One evening in [[Cairo]], during a sketch in which he was supposed to be in a costume that required a [[pith helmet]], having forgotten the prop, Cooper reached out and borrowed a [[fez]] from a passing waiter, which got huge laughs.&lt;ref name="BBC2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A2116496#footnote1 |title=h2g2 - Tommy Cooper - Just Like That - Edited Entry |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wore a fez whenever performing after that, the prop later being described as "an icon of 20th-century comedy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/shortcuts/2016/dec/05/tommy-cooper-fez-much-more-than-prop|title=Just like hat! Why Tommy Cooper’s fez was much more than a prop|first=Brian|last=Logan|date=5 December 2016|website=the Guardian|accessdate=27 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development of the act==
When he was [[demobilization|demobbed]] after seven years of military service Cooper took up show business on Christmas Eve, 1947. He later developed a popular [[monologue]] about his military experience as "Cooper the Trooper". He worked in variety theatres around the country and at many of London's top night spots, performing as many as 52 shows in one week.&lt;ref name="Roy Busby"&gt;{{cite book|author=Roy Busby|title=British Music Hall: An Illustrated Who's Who from 1850 to the Present Day|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=&amp;pg=PA|year=|publisher= |isbn=023640053-3|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cooper had developed his conjuring skills and was a member of [[The Magic Circle]], but there are various stories about how and when he developed his delivery of "failed" magic tricks:&lt;ref name="BBC2"/&gt;

*He was performing to his shipbuilding colleagues when everything went wrong, but he noticed that the failed tricks got laughs.
*He started making "mistakes" on purpose when he was in the Army.
*His tricks went wrong at a post-war audition, but the panel thoroughly enjoyed them anyway.

To keep the audience on their toes Cooper threw in an occasional trick that worked when it was least expected.

==Career==
Cooper was influenced by [[Laurel and Hardy]],&lt;ref name="Fish"&gt;John Fisher, ''Tommy Cooper: Always Leave Them Laughing'', Harper Collins, 2006, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; [[Max Miller (comedian)|Max Miller]],&lt;ref name="Fish"/&gt; [[Bob Hope]],&lt;ref name="Fish"/&gt; and [[Robert Orben]].&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, ''Tommy Cooper'', pp. 157–158&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1947, Cooper got his big break with Miff Ferrie, at that time trombonist in a band called The Jackdaws, who booked him to appear as the second-spot comedian in a show starring the [[Sanding (dance)|sand dance]] act Marqueeze and the Dance of the Seven Veils. Cooper then began two years of arduous performing, including a tour of Europe and a stint in [[pantomime]], playing one of [[Cinderella]]'s ugly sisters. The period culminated in a season-long booking at the [[Windmill Theatre]], where he doubled up doing cabaret. In one week, he performed 52 shows. Ferrie remained Cooper's sole agent for 37 years, until Cooper's death in 1984. Cooper was supported by a variety of acts, including the vocal percussionist [[Frank Holder (musician)|Frank Holder]].

Cooper rapidly became a top-liner in variety with his turn as the conjurer whose tricks never succeeded, but it was his television work that raised him to national prominence. After his debut on the [[BBC]] talent show ''New to You'' in March 1948 he started starring in his own shows, and was popular with audiences for nearly 40 years, notably through his work with [[London Weekend Television]] from 1968 to 1972 and with [[Thames Television]] from 1973 to 1980. Thanks to his many television shows during the mid-1970s, he was one of the most recognisable comedians in the world.

John Fisher writes in his biography of Cooper: "Everyone agrees that he was mean. Quite simply he was acknowledged as the [[Miser|tightest]] man in show business, with a pathological dread of reaching into his pocket." One of Cooper's stunts was to pay the exact taxi fare and when leaving the cab to slip something into the taxi driver's pocket saying, "Have a drink on me." That something would turn out to be a tea bag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b007hzl2 |title=BBC Two - The Art of Tommy Cooper |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2014-04-20 |accessdate=2015-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid-1970s, alcohol had started to erode Cooper's professionalism and club owners complained that he turned up late or rushed through his show in five minutes. In addition he suffered from chronic [[indigestion]], [[lumbago]], [[sciatica]], [[bronchitis]] and severe circulation problems in his legs. When Cooper realised the extent of his maladies he cut down on his drinking, and the energy and confidence returned to his act. However, he never stopped drinking and could be fallible: on an otherwise triumphant appearance with [[Michael Parkinson]] he forgot to set the safety catch on the [[Guillotine (magic trick)#The traditional Guillotine illusion|guillotine illusion]] into which he had cajoled Parkinson, and only a last-minute intervention by the [[floor manager]] saved Parkinson from serious injury or worse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/the-secret-life-of-tommy-cooper-417272.html |title=The secret life of Tommy Cooper |newspaper=The Independent |date=2006-09-24 |accessdate=2015-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Cooper was a heavy [[alcoholic beverage|drinker]] and [[tobacco smoking|smoker]], and experienced a decline in health during the late 1970s, suffering a heart attack in 1977 while in Rome, where he was performing a show. Three months later he was back on television in ''Night Out at the [[Prince Edward Theatre|London Casino]]''. 

By 1980, however, his drinking meant that [[Thames Television]] would not give him another starring series, and ''Cooper's Half Hour'' was his last. He did continue to appear as a guest on other television shows, however, and worked with [[Eric Sykes]] on two Thames productions in 1982.

== Death on live television ==
On 15 April 1984, Cooper collapsed from a heart attack in front of millions of television viewers, midway through his act on the [[London Weekend Television]] variety show ''[[Live from Her Majesty's]]'', transmitted live from [[Her Majesty's Theatre]] in [[City of Westminster|Westminster]], London.&lt;ref name="wales"/&gt;

An assistant had helped him put on a cloak for his sketch, while [[Jimmy Tarbuck]], the host, was hiding behind the curtain waiting to pass him different props that he would then appear to pull from inside his gown.&lt;ref name="wales"&gt;{{cite news |date=12 April 2009 |author=Nathan Bevan |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2009/04/12/tommy-cooper-s-last-act-fooled-us-all-says-jimmy-tarbuck-91466-23367910/ |title=Tommy Cooper's last act fooled us all, says Jimmy Tarbuck |work=Wales on Sunday}}&lt;/ref&gt; The assistant smiled at him as he collapsed, believing that it was a part of the act.&lt;ref name="wales-youtube"&gt;{{cite news |title=Tommy Cooper death video posted on YouTube|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2009/05/10/tommy-cooper-death-video-posted-on-youtube-91466-23585341/ |date=10 May 2009 |author=Kelly Miles |work=Wales on Sunday}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the audience gave "uproarious" laughter as he fell, gasping for air.&lt;ref name="wales"/&gt; 

At this point, Alasdair MacMillan, the director of the television production, cued the orchestra to play music for an unscripted commercial break (noticeable because of several seconds of [[Vertical blanking interval|blank screen]] while LWT's [[master control]] contacted regional stations to start transmitting advertisements)&lt;ref name="wales"/&gt; and Tarbuck's manager tried to pull Cooper back through the curtains. 

It was decided to continue with the show. [[Dustin Gee]] and [[Les Dennis]] were the act that had to follow Cooper, and other stars proceeded to present their acts in the limited space in front of the stage. While the show continued, efforts were being made backstage to revive Cooper, not made any easier by the darkness. It was not until a second commercial break that the paramedics were able to move his body to [[Westminster Hospital]], where he was pronounced [[dead on arrival]]. His death was not officially reported until the next morning, although the incident was the leading item on the news programme that followed the show. Cooper was cremated at [[Mortlake Crematorium]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lodgebros.co.uk/news/mortlake-crematorium-celebrates-75-years/|title=Mortlake Crematorium Celebrates 75 Years |publisher=Lodge Brothers - Funeral Directors |accessdate=22 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Amy |last=Dyduch |url=http://www.richmondandtwickenhamtimes.co.uk/news/11261771.Mortlake_Crematorium_marks_75_years/ |title=Mortlake Crematorium marks 75 years |newspaper=Richond and Twickenham Times |date=7 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The video of Tommy Cooper suffering the fatal heart attack on stage has been uploaded to numerous [[Video hosting service|video sharing]] websites. [[YouTube]] drew criticism from a number of sources when footage of the incident was posted on the website in May 2009. John Beyer of the pressure group [[Mediawatch-UK]] said: "This is very poor taste. That the broadcasters have not repeated the incident shows they have a respect for him and I think that ought to apply also on YouTube."&lt;ref name="wales-youtube"/&gt; On 28 December 2011 segments of the ''Live From Her Majesty's'' clip, including Cooper collapsing on stage, were included in the [[Channel 4]] programme ''The Untold Tommy Cooper''.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

==Personal life==
From 1967 until his death, Cooper had a relationship with his personal assistant, Mary Fieldhouse. She wrote about it in her book, ''For the Love of Tommy'' (1986).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last= Fieldhouse| first= Mary| title= For the Love of Tommy| publisher = [[Anova Books|Robson Books Ltd]]| place= London| year= 1986| isbn= 978-0860513872}}&lt;/ref&gt; His widow, Gwen Henty, whom he married in [[Cyprus]] in 1947 but never divorced, died in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| url= http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/3096| author= Marc Brodie| title=''Cooper, Thomas Frederick [Tommy] (1921–1984)''| work  = Oxford Dictionary of National Biography| publisher= [[Oxford University Press]]| accessdate = 30 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of their two sons, actor [[Thomas Henty]], was born in 1956 and died in 1988. Cooper's will was probated on 29 August 1984 at £327,272.&lt;ref&gt;Court of Great Lambeth law England and Wales (CGPLA)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy and honours==
[[File:Tommy Cooper by Aberdare Blog.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of Tommy Cooper, near the castle, in [[Caerphilly]].]]

A statue of Cooper was unveiled in his birthplace of [[Caerphilly]], Wales, in 2008 by fellow entertainer Sir [[Anthony Hopkins]], who is patron of the [[Tommy Cooper Society]]. The statue was sculpted by James Done.&lt;ref name=Stat&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/7260219.stm |title=Tommy Cooper statue is unveiled |publisher=BBC News |date=23 February 2008 |accessdate=20 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hip-hop duo [[dan le sac vs Scroobius Pip]] wrote the song "Tommy C", about Cooper's career and death, which appears on their 2008 album, ''[[Angles (Dan Le Sac Vs Scroobius Pip album)|Angles]]''.  In 2009 for [[Red Nose Day]], a charity Red Nose was put on the statue, but the nose was stolen.&lt;ref name=Stat1&gt;{{cite web|last=Rhys |first=Steffan |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2009/01/30/tommy-cooper-statue-s-red-nose-gone-just-like-that-91466-22814692 | title=Tommy Cooper statue's red nose gone just like that | work=Wales News | publisher=WalesOnline |date= |accessdate=20 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cooper was a member of the [[Grand Order of Water Rats]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gowr.co.uk/roll-of-honour/|title=Roll of Honour|publisher=Grand Order of Water Rats |date=April 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2005 poll ''The Comedians' Comedian'', Cooper was voted the sixth greatest comedy act ever by fellow comedians and comedy insiders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/jan/02/arts.artsnews|title=Cook Tops Poll of Comedy Greats|access-date=10 April 2017|date=2 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been cited as an influence by [[Jason Manford]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=WalesOnline |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/showbiz-and-lifestyle/television-in-wales/2011/07/11/i-thought-about-retraining-as-a-plasterer-says-ex-one-show-presenter-jason-manford-91466-29033283/ |title=I thought about retraining as a plasterer, says ex-One Show presenter Jason Manford |publisher=Walesonline.co.uk |date= |accessdate=20 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John Lydon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/omm/story/0,,1240051,00.html |title=Metal box, P.I.L |publisher=Observer.guardian.co.uk |date=11 February 2011 |accessdate=20 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jerome Flynn]] has toured with his own tribute show to Cooper called ''Just Like That''.

In February 2007, ''[[The Independent]]'' reported that [[Andy Harries]], a producer of ''[[The Queen (2006 film)|The Queen]]'', was working on a dramatisation about the last week of Tommy Cooper's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/just-like-that-tommy-coopers-final-days-447928.html | work=The Independent | location=London | title=Just like that!

From a screenplay by [[Simon Nye]], ''[[Tommy Cooper: Not Like That, Like This]]'' was directed by Benjamin Caron and the title role was played by [[David Threlfall]]; it was broadcast 21 April 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Mayer|last=Nissim|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/news/a483937/shameless-david-threlfall-to-play-tommy-cooper-in-one-off-itv-drama.html|title='Shameless' David Threlfall to play Tommy Cooper in one-off ITV drama|publisher=Digital Spy|date=23 May 2013|accessdate=23 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 the [[British Heart Foundation]] ran a series of adverts featuring Tommy Cooper to raise awareness of heart conditions. These included posters bearing his image together with radio adverts featuring classic Cooper jokes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.marketingweek.co.uk/news/bhf-uses-tommy-cooper-in-latest-ads/4002017.article|title= BHF uses Tommy Cooper in latest ads|publisher= Centaur Media Plc|work= Marketing Week|first= Russell|last= Parsons|date= 1 June 2012|accessdate= 4 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
