==Early life==
Cross was born in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]],&lt;ref name="biography.com" /&gt; the son of Barry and Susi, the former of whom emigrated from [[Leeds]], [[England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/interviews/2010/10/29/12031/while_i%92m_doing_alvin_and_the_chipmunks%2C_i%92m_thinking_of_awful_risque%26%238237%3B_%26%238236%3Bthings|title='While I’m doing Alvin And The Chipmunks, I'm thinking of awful risque things': Interview with David Cross|publisher=Chortle.com.uk|date=October 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six months after his birth, Cross's family moved to [[Florida]]. After additional moves to New York and Connecticut, the family settled back in [[Roswell, Georgia]], where Cross remained for nearly a decade. His family was poor and Barry left the family when Cross was 10 years old; the two have not spoken since he was 19, though they both primarily resided in New York City until Cross sold his home there in 2011.&lt;ref name="WTF with Marc Maron Interview"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episodes/episode_269_-_david_cross/ | title=WTF with Marc Maron Podcast – Episode 269 – David Cross | accessdate=April 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cross and his family were evicted from their home while living in Georgia. He spent some time living in motels and at friends' homes while growing up.&lt;ref name="Adam Carolla Podcast Interview"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/2009.06.29acp-Cross|title=Adam Carolla Podcast Interview: Cross|date=2009-06-29|work=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has two sisters and once bailed his youngest sibling out of jail.&lt;ref name="carolla1010"&gt;{{cite web| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110723131717/http://www.adamcarolla.com/ACPBlog/2010/10/07/david-cross/| archivedate= July 23, 2011|work=[[The Adam Carolla Show (terrestrial radio)|Adam Carolla Show]]| url= http://www.adamcarolla.com/ACPBlog/2010/10/07/david-cross/ |title=David Cross 10/7/2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--He attended Northside High School of the Performing Arts (now [[North Atlanta High School]]), graduating in 1982. Cross was elected treasurer of his senior class and was voted "Most Humorous" by his classmates.--&gt;

==Career==

===Stand-up===
At age 17, Cross began performing [[stand-up comedy]]. The day after he graduated from [[North Atlanta High School|Northside High School]] in Atlanta, Cross relocated to [[New York City]]. Lacking a plan, he drifted, working briefly for a lawn care company on [[Long Island]]. Later, he enrolled at [[Emerson College]] in [[Boston]]. He would drop out after only a semester, but during his time there, Cross joined This is Pathetic, a college sketch group, where he met [[John Ennis (actor)|John Ennis]].  In the summer of 1985, the two aspiring actors took a road trip to Los Angeles, although this did not significantly further their acting careers.  In Boston, Cross began to perform stand-up more regularly. From the mid-1980s to the early 1990s, Boston had a booming comedy scene, although Cross did not fit the types of acts being booked most of the time. He recalls that it was "a loud-, dumb-, pandering-, racist-, homophobic-type scene".&lt;ref name= odenkirk&gt;Odenkirk, Naomi.  (2002). ''Mr. Show What Happened?!'' Beverly Hills, CA: The Management Group. {{ISBN|0-9713597-8-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, a new comedy scene began to emerge at the comedy club chain [[Catch a Rising Star (comedy clubs)|Catch a Rising Star]]. Alongside [[Janeane Garofalo]], [[Louis C.K.]], and other comics, Cross appeared regularly several nights a week. Cross formed the sketch comedy group "Cross Comedy" with 12 other performers, and they put on a new show every week. They were known for playing tricks on the audience, such as introducing fake comics or planting fake [[heckler]]s. Cross became increasingly focused on his comedy work.&lt;ref name=odenkirk /&gt;

Cross later performed at the [[alternative comedy]] club [[Un-Cabaret]] in Los Angeles, where radio artist [[Joe Frank]] heard him, and hired him to appear in Frank's 1994 radio programs, ''A Hearing'' and ''The Last Run'' (in 1997 combined to become ''The OJ Chronicles''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.joefrank.com/shop/o-j-chronicles-the|title=O.J. Chronicles, The|first= John | last= Malloy|website=JoeFrank.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;), where Cross appears as OJ's valet. Cross also starred in the Joe Frank program ''Jam'', produced in 1999,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.joefrank.com/shop/jam|title=Jam|website=JoeFrank.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has more recently worked with Joe Frank on radio shows for [[KCRW]]'s ''[[Unfictional]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.kcrw.com/news-culture/shows/unfictional/joe-frank-downfall?|title=Joe Frank: Downfall |work= UnFictional |publisher= KCRW.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cross's stand-up comedy blends political commentary and satire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800343908/bio |title=David Cross Biography |publisher= Movies.yahoo.com |date=1964-04-04 |accessdate=2010-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, he performed a one-hour comedy special, ''The Pride Is Back'', on [[HBO]]. He has released three recordings: ''[[Shut Up You Fucking Baby!]]'', ''[[It's Not Funny]]'', and ''[[Bigger and Blackerer]]''. Cross's stand up material was featured in [[Comedy Central]]'s animated series [[Shorties Watchin' Shorties]]. In 2004, ''Shut Up You Fucking Baby!'' was nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album]]. In 2003, he released his first tour film ''[[Let America Laugh]]'' and was named #85 on Comedy Central's list of the 100 greatest stand-ups of all time. He appears on [[Un-Cabaret]] compilation albums, including ''Freak Weather Feels Different'' and ''The Good, the Bad and the Drugly''.

Cross announced a 51-date nationwide stand-up tour from Jan. 26, 2016, in San Diego through April 24, 2016, in Oklahoma City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =http://www.ew.com/article/2016/01/05/david-cross-announces-making-america-great-again-nationwide-stand-tour | title = David Cross announces 'Making America Great Again!' nationwide stand-up tour | first = Dan | last = Snierson | publisher = Entertainment Weekly | date = 2016-01-05 | accessdate = 2016-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Titled “Making America Great Again!”, it was his first tour in six years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =http://www.avclub.com/article/david-cross-announces-his-first-stand-tour-6-years-230286 | title = David Cross announces his first stand-up tour in 6 years | first = Alex | last =  McCown | publisher = A.V.

===Television and film===
[[File:DavidCross2007.jpg|thumb|right|Cross at the 2007 Plug Awards]]
Cross began his professional television career as a writer on ''[[The Ben Stiller Show]]''. The series hired him toward the end of its run, and he occasionally made brief appearances in the sketches. He had a speaking role in "The Legend of T.J. O'Pootertoot", a sketch written almost entirely by Cross. It was during this period that he first met [[Bob Odenkirk]], with whom he would later co-create the HBO [[sketch comedy]] series ''[[Mr. Show with Bob and David|Mr. Show]]'' in 1995. Cross won an Emmy for his work on ''The Ben Stiller Show'' in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/story?oid=oid:74197 | title = Something Completely Different | first = Ron | last = Deutsch | work= Austin Chronicle | date = 1999-10-08 | accessdate = 2008-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997 he played Newton, an employee of the NYC Morgue in [[Men in Black]] he would reprise the role of Newton as an owner of a video rental store in [[Men in Black II]] in 2002.

Cross later co-starred as [[Tobias Fünke]] in ''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]]'', originally intended to be only a minor role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clark|first1=Meredith|title=Q&amp;A: David Cross on 'Arrested Development,' Cutoff Shorts and Overpowering the Grid |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/q-a-david-cross-on-arrested-development-cutoff-shorts-and-overpowering-the-grid-20120822|website=[[Rolling Stone]] |accessdate=21 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also played smaller roles on programs such as ''[[Just Shoot Me!]]'', ''[[The Drew Carey Show]]'', ''[[NewsRadio]]'', ''[[Strangers with Candy]]'','' [[Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job]]'', and ''[[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]]''. From October 2005, Cross regularly appeared on Comedy Central's ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' as [[Stephen Colbert (character)|Stephen Colbert]]'s nemesis Russ Lieber, a fictional liberal radio talk show host from [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]], [[Wisconsin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last1= Evans| first1= Bradford| title=Why ‘The Colbert Report’ Should Use Correspondents More Often|url=http://splitsider.com/2014/02/why-the-colbert-report-should-use-correspondents-more-often/|website=[[Splitsider]]|accessdate=21 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cross developed an animated series for Comedy Central called ''[[Freak Show (TV series)|Freak Show]]'', which co-starred [[H. Jon Benjamin]] and was cancelled due to low ratings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Comedy Gods David Cross and Jon Benjamin Made A Cartoon!! Comedy Central’s FREAK SHOW!!|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/30294|website=[[Ain't It Cool News]]|accessdate=21 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has appeared several times on ''[[Wonder Showzen]]''.

Cross teamed up with ''Mr. Show'' director and producer [[Troy Miller]] and Odenkirk to produce a feature film ''[[Run Ronnie Run]]'', based on one of their ''Mr. Show'' characters. The film satirized the [[reality television]] craze, and featured cameos from many stars; however, Odenkirk got into conflict with the studio [[New Line Cinema]], and they then released it [[direct-to-video]]. In 1994 and again in 1999, Cross was a guest voice actor on [[Joe Frank]]'s radio show, featured in the episodes "The Last Run", "A Hearing", "The O.J. Chronicles", and "Jam". In 2013, he returned, making an appearance in an episode of Frank's radio show, entitled "A Conversation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Joe Frank: A Conversation| publisher= KCRW.com| work=UnFictional| url=http://www.kcrw.com/etc/programs/uf/uf130125joe_frank_a_conversa | accessdate= 3 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Cross provided voices for a Marine in ''[[Halo 2]]'' and a store clerk named [[List of characters in Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas#Zero|Zero]] in ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Joe Frank: A Conversation|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/samuel-l-jackson-james-woods-lead-san-andreas-all-star-cast/1100-6111344/|work=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=21 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also the voice of the "Happy-Time Harry" doll and Bert Banana in ''Aqua Teen Hunger Force'' (although the part was credited as Sir Willups Brightslymoore). Cross has made guest appearances in ''[[Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!]]''. He directed the music video for [[The Black Keys]]' song "[[10 A.M. Automatic]]," a spoof of [[public-access television]]. ''[[Paste Magazine]]'' ranked it number 24 on their list of the 50 Best Music Videos of the Decade (2000–2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/blogs/lists/2009/11/apologies-to-kanye-but-while.html?p=6|title=The 50 Best Music Videos of the Decade 2000–2009)|work=[[Paste Magazine]]|publisher=Paste Media Group| first= Steve| last= Labate| date= 2009-11-09|accessdate=21 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cross contributes to ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'' magazine, writing a column, ''My America''. In 2005, he contributed to the [[United Nations Children's Fund|UNICEF]] benefit song "[[Do They Know It's Hallowe'en?]]" and appeared in one of [[PETA]]'s "I'd Rather Go Naked Than Wear Fur" campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first= Bruna |last= Nessif| url= http://www.eonline.com/news/422046/blast-from-the-past-funnyman-david-cross-wears-his-own-fur-in-never-nude-peta-ad| title= Blast from the Past: Funnyman David Cross Wears His Own Fur in Never Nude PETA Ad| website= EOnline.com| date= 22 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Beastie Boys]]' 2006 concert film ''[[Awesome; I Fuckin' Shot That!]]'', Cross portrays Nathaniel Hörnblowér in the fictional segment "A Day in the Life of Nathaniel Hörnblowér." In ''[[I'm Not There]]'', Cross portrays [[Allen Ginsberg]]. Both [[Bill Lawrence (producer)|Bill Lawrence]] and [[Zach Braff]] of the TV series ''[[Scrubs (TV show)|Scrubs]]'' were eager to have Cross make a cameo appearance on the series as [[Tobias Fünke]], but due to the series' cancellation, the plan never came to fruition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/categories/scrubs/|title=Zach Braff on Scrubs, Fletch and Being Goofy| author= Mischalova|date=Sep 6, 2006|publisher=The Hollywood Gossip.com|quote=The one person I want right now is David Cross.

He portrayed [[Ian Hawke]] in ''[[Alvin and the Chipmunks (film)|Alvin and the Chipmunks]]'', ''[[Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel]]'', and ''[[Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last1= Carlson| first1= Eric| title= David Cross Clarifies Rant Against 'Alvin and The Chipmunks: Chipwrecked' Producer| url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/david-cross-alvin-chipmunks-chipwrecked-movie-producer-280950| website= [[The Hollywood Reporter]] |accessdate=21 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and voiced [[List of Kung Fu Panda characters#Master Crane|Crane]] in the [[Kung Fu Panda (franchise)|''Kung Fu Panda'' film franchise]].

Cross's directorial debut film ''[[Hits (film)|Hits]]'' premiered at the [[2014 Sundance Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sundance 2014: World Cinema Dramatic Competition|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/sundance-2014-world-cinema-dramatic-competition|accessdate=January 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Hits – Director David Cross|url=http://filmmakermagazine.com/82832-hits-director-david-cross/|accessdate=January 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of selling the film rights  to distributors, Cross instead opted to sell the movie over [[Bit Torrent]] through their "bundles" program,&lt;ref name=Vergebundle&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kastrenakes|first1=Jacob|title=David Cross' new movie will be the first feature film distributed in a BitTorrent Bundle| url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/7/7508239/david-cross-movie-hits-bittorrent-bundle-kickstarter-pay-what-you-want|website=The Verge|accessdate=8 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which BitTorrent launched to help "legitimize" the platform.&lt;ref name=Vergebundle/&gt; According to ''[[The Verge]]'', it was the first feature film to be distributed in such a format.&lt;ref name=Vergebundle/&gt;  At the same time, Cross launched a [[Kickstarter]] campaign for the movie's general release which would then distribute the movie using a [[pay what you want]] methodology.&lt;ref name=Vergebundle/&gt;

In April 2015, episodes were ordered for a new sketch comedy show starring Cross and Odenkirk called ''[[W/ Bob &amp; David]]''.&lt;ref name="with"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/02/bob-odenkirk-david-cross-netflix_n_6994374.html |title=Bob Odenkirk &amp; David Cross Are Reuniting For A Netflix Series |last=Whitney |first=Erin |date=April 2, 2015 |website=[[The Huffington Post]] |publisher=[[Arianna Huffington]] |access-date=April 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It premiered in November 2015 on [[Netflix]]. Cross and Odenkirk write, star in, and produce the show.

On the January 10, 2016, broadcast of the National Public Radio-syndicated quiz show ''[[Ask Me Another (radio)|Ask Me Another]]'', Cross appeared as a celebrity guest and performed well enough that at the audience's request the show's producers took the unusual step of allowing him to advance to the show's final, championship round; he then won that round and became that episode's overall champion, winning a prize package that included a pair of denim cutoff shorts that he himself had autographed.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Cross provided the lead character's "white voice" in the [[science fiction film|science fiction]] [[comedy film]] ''[[Sorry to Bother You (film)|Sorry to Bother You]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2017/06/tessa-thompson-lakeith-stanfield-steven-yeun-movie-sorry-to-bother-you-1202113786/|title=Tessa Thompson, Lakeith Stanfield, Steven Yeun To Star In ‘Sorry To Bother You’|last=Busch|first=Anita|work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date= June 15, 2017|access-date=May 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was released in theaters on July 6, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/watch-lakeith-stanfield-in-wild-sorry-to-bother-you-trailer-w520411|title=Watch Lakeith Stanfield Make Millions With 'White Voice' in Wild 'Sorry to Bother You' Trailer|last=Blistein|first=Jon|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date= May 17, 2018|access-date=May 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences==
Cross has said his comedic influences include [[Bill Hicks]],&lt;ref&gt;Cross, David. In {{cite web|url=http://www.simonguildford.com/?page=2 |title=Does Anybody Remember Laughter? |first=Simon |last=Guildford |publisher=SimonGuildford.com |date=June 21, 2007 |quote=I was definitely influenced by Bill Hicks. Well, maybe less 'influenced' than 'inspired by'. When I first met him, I was doing stuff that I do now, so maybe I wasn’t directly influenced by him. But he was certainly inspiring. |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6OgS7Q5Ln?url=http://www.simonguildford.com/does-anybody-remember-laughter |archivedate=2014-04-08 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andy Kaufman]],&lt;ref name=netplaces /&gt; ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'',&lt;ref name=netplaces /&gt; [[Lou Costello]],&lt;ref name=netplaces /&gt;  [[Steven Wright]],&lt;ref name=netplaces /&gt;  [[Richard Pryor]],&lt;ref name=netplaces /&gt; and [[Lenny Bruce]].&lt;ref name=netplaces&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.netplaces.com/comedy-writing/lets-get-sketchy/profile-in-comedy-david-cross.htm | title = Profile in Comedy: David Cross – Comedy Writing| publisher=NetPlaces.com| date= n.d.| archivedate=April 7, 2011|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110407012456/http://www.netplaces.com/comedy-writing/lets-get-sketchy/profile-in-comedy-david-cross.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
In October 2005, Cross was sued by Nashville club owner Thomas Weber, who accused Cross of taping him without permission for ''[[Shut Up You Fucking Baby]]'' and ''[[Let America Laugh]]'' in violation of Weber's privacy rights. In April 2006, the case against Cross himself was dismissed and the case proceeded with Warner Music, Subpop Records, WEA Corporation, and the Alternative Distribution Alliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.mediabistro.com/fishbowlny/lawsuit-against-david-cross-warner-music-dismissed_b3024|title=Lawsuit Against David Cross, Warner Music Dismissed|author=Dylan|date=Aug 21, 2006|publisher=[[Mediabistro.com]]| accessdate= Nov 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nashvillestandup.com/thomas-weber-exit-in-dude-sues-david-cross/|title=Thomas Weber (Exit-In dude) sues David Cross|last=Riden|first=Chad|date=October 12, 2005| website=nashvillestandup.com|accessdate=Nov 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2012 interview with ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine, Cross revealed that he had snorted a small amount of [[cocaine]] at the 2009 White House Correspondents' Dinner. Cross said, "It wasn’t like I got high...It was just about being able to say that I did it, that I did cocaine in the same room as the president."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/david-cross-cocaine-white-house-293785 |title=David Cross Admits to Snorting Cocaine at the White House Correspondents Dinner |first=Erin |last=Carlson |newspaper=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=February 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 18, 2018, Cross tweeted a photo of himself wearing sacred Latter Day Saint (Mormon) undergarments.  The tweet was meant to promote his show at Kingsbury Hall in Salt Lake City, Utah.  He faced criticism from LDS Church members who claim the photo was offensive to their religion and asked that the show be cancelled.  Ruth V. Watkins, President of the University of Utah where Kingsbury Hall is located released the following statement: “The University of Utah condemns bigotry and religious intolerance in any form. The offensive use of sacred religious imagery in a tweet by David Cross promoting his performance at Kingsbury Hall was in opposition to the university’s values of respect and inclusivity.  The use of the imagery was deeply offensive. At the same time, the First Amendment protects such speech, and the university cannot and will not censor content of those coming to campus. We acknowledge the free speech rights of individuals and entities who rent university facilities—even those with whom we disagree. By doing so, we protect the free speech rights of all.”

===Criticisms and feuds===

====Larry the Cable Guy====
In April 2005, Cross criticized stand-up comedian Larry the Cable Guy in a ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' interview, saying, "It's a lot of [[homophobia|anti-gay]], [[racism|racist]] humor—which people like in America—all couched in 'I'm telling it like it is.' He's in the right place at the right time for that gee-shucks, proud-to-be-a-[[redneck]], I'm-just-a-straight-shooter-multimillionaire-in-cutoff-[[flannel]]-selling-[[ringtone|ring-tones]] act. That's where we are as a nation now. We're in a state of vague American values and anti-[[intellectual]] pride."

In response, Larry devoted a chapter in his book ''GIT-R-DONE'' to Cross and the "[[political correctness|PC]] [[left-wing politics|left]]", claiming that Cross had "screwed with my fans, it was time for me to say something". Larry claimed that ''Rolling Stone'' was baiting comedians to attack him, and they turned to Cross only after [[Lewis Black]] refused (as Larry and Lewis are good friends&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ullman|first=Ethan|title=Interview with comedian Lewis Black|url=http://www.albanystudentpress.org/interview-with-comedian-lewis-black-1.1278668#.Ue81B23lfms|accessdate=24 July 2013|newspaper=[[Albany Student Press]]|date=24 March 2010|quote=And we totally don't agree on politics, but he's a friend of mine.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203170028/http://www.albanystudentpress.org/interview-with-comedian-lewis-black-1.1278668#.Ue81B23lfms|archivedate=3 February 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Cross responded with ''An Open Letter to Larry the Cable Guy'' posted on his website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first= David| last= Cross| work=The Bob and Davider| archivedate=14 October 2009| publisher= BobandDavid.com| date= October 2, 2007| title= An Open Letter to Larry The Cable Guy| url= http://www.bobanddavid.com/2007/10/an_open_letter_to_larry_the_ca.html| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091014092745/http://www.bobanddavid.com/2007/10/an_open_letter_to_larry_the_ca.html| deadurl= yes| accessdate= March 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to mock Larry in his stand-up, satirizing ''[[Blue Collar TV]]'' during a guest appearance on ''[[Wonder Showzen]]''. In December 2005, he ended his performance on Comedy Central's ''Last Laugh '05'' by mockingly yelling Larry's catchphrase, "GIT-R-DONE!", to the audience as he left the stage. He pokes fun at Larry's comedy in ''Freak Show'' with a character called "Danny the Plumber Guy".

====James Lipton====
Cross has criticized ''[[Inside the Actors Studio]]'' host James Lipton on a ''Mr. Show'' sketch and in his stand-up performance ''The Pride Is Back'', calling him "pretentious."&lt;ref&gt;Cross, David. ''The Pride Is Back'', track: "James Lipton"&lt;/ref&gt; Lipton, who thought that Cross's impression of him was not good-natured, would later appear alongside Cross in ''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]]'', in the recurring role of Prison Warden Stefan Gentiles. During filming, Cross was impressed with Lipton's acting and comedic ability, and the two became good friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.premiumhollywood.com/2007/05/24/a-couple-of-questions-withjames-lipton/ |title= A Couple of Questions with…James Lipton |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On one commentary track for season four of ''Mr. Show'', Cross discussed the encounter, complimenting Lipton for his professionalism and performance, saying that he liked Lipton personally but still "didn't care for" ''Inside The Actors Studio''.

====Alvin and the Chipmunks====
Responding to critics of his decision to appear in the critically panned, but commercially successful, ''Alvin and the Chipmunks'', Cross noted that the film paid for a summer home,&lt;ref name=netburn&gt;{{cite news| last= Netburn| first= Deborah| url= http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jan/03/entertainment/et-webcross3 |title=Comedian defends his kid-flick role|newspaper=Los Angeles Times| date=3 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more than "all my other projects combined: book, TV show, the two pilots, ''[[Year One (film)|Year One]]'', yeah."&lt;ref name=sicha&gt;{{cite news| last= Sicha| first=Choire| url= http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-ca-conversation14-2009jun14,0,4296916,full.story |title= It's full speed ahead for David Cross|newspaper=Los Angeles Times| date=14 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he has admitted to taking the role primarily for the money, he has said that he does not regret doing so or consider it to be "selling out" as he has nothing against entertainment designed for children to enjoy that does not send a bad message.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1pNO9OM2MA |title= Amplified: David Cross Defends 'Chipmunks' |publisher=YouTube |date=2010-05-31 |accessdate=2013-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cross reprised his ''Chipmunks'' role in the film's two sequels, ''[[Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel]]'' and ''[[Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked]]''. In 2011, Cross said the third film was "the most unpleasant experience I've ever had in my professional life."&lt;ref name=Toro&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/david-cross-calls-chip-wrecked-the-most-unpleasant-experience-of-his-career# |title=David Cross Calls 'Chip-Wrecked' 'The Most Unpleasant Experience' Of His Career|first=Gabe |last=Toro |publisher=[[Indiewire|Indiewire.com]]|date=December 14, 2011|accessdate=January 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that this was due to clashes with one particular producer, clarifying later that it was not [[Janice Karman]] or [[Ross Bagdasarian, Jr.]]&lt;ref name=Toro/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2012/01/12/chipwrecked-producer-responds|title='Chipwrecked' producer responds to David Cross' statements and Facebook apology|first= Aly |last=Semigran|date=January 12, 2012| work=Entertainment Weekly|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110004645/http://insidemovies.ew.com/2012/01/12/chipwrecked-producer-responds/|archivedate=2013-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scott Stapp====

Cross has been critical of several [[pop music]] acts in his standup comedy, notably [[Creed (band)|Creed]] and its lead singer, [[Scott Stapp]]. On his 2004 album ''It's Not Funny'', Cross referred to Creed as "the third-worst band in history”, and maligned the group's pop sensibilities for being too ubiquitous, suggesting that Stapp hung around "10th grade girls' locker rooms" to find inspiration for his song lyrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last= Riedel| first= David| url= http://www.cbsnews.com/news/david-cross-five-things-to-know-about-him/ |title=David Cross: Five things to know about him|publisher= [[CBS News]]| date=August 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cross then relates an anecdote about Stapp being a last-minute replacement for another celebrity at a taping of ''[[Celebrity Poker Showdown]]'' in 2003. Cross became concerned that a confrontation would take place since he had "said the most awful shit about that guy [Stapp] on stage and in print."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ctTiP7GfSI |title= David Cross - Hidden Track (Scott Stapp) |publisher= YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cross said that as the taping was preparing to commence, he approached Stapp and extended his hand, introducing himself, and that Stapp shook his hand and sarcastically intoned, "Thanks for the words”, to which Cross replied, "Well, you know..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last= Modell| first= Josh| url= http://www.avclub.com/article/david-cross-67239 |title=David Cross |work= [[The A.V.

==Personal life==
Cross was raised [[Judaism|Jewish]] and later became an [[Atheism|atheist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.avclub.com/content/node/22961 |title=Interview: David Cross|work= [[The A.V.

In August 2011, after four years of dating, Cross became engaged to [[Amber Tamblyn]]. They married in 2012.&lt;ref name="us-married"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/amber-tamblyn-29-weds-david-cross-48-2012710 |title=Exclusive: Amber Tamblyn, 29, Weds David Cross, 48|work=[[Us Weekly]] |date=October 7, 2012 |accessdate= October 26, 2016|archivedate= March 3, 2016 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160303192012/http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/amber-tamblyn-29-weds-david-cross-48-2012710| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On February 21, 2017, Tamblyn announced that she and Cross had recently had a daughter, whose name she jokingly&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Juneau|first1=Jen|title=Not Crying Over Spilled (Breast) Milk!

On September 26, 2013, [[Kickstarter]] co-founder Yancey Strickler revealed that Cross was the first investor in the [[crowdfunding]] platform.
