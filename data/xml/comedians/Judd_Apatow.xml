When Apatow was twelve years old, his parents divorced. Robert went to live with his maternal grandparents, and Mia went to live with her mother. As a child, Apatow lived mainly with his father, and visited his mother on weekends. Apatow's mother spent a summer working at a comedy club, which is where Judd was first exposed to live [[stand-up comedy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Judd Apatow 30-year career timeline: from stand-up comedy to his "Knocked Up" spin-off|date=October 19, 2011|url=http://www.ifc.com/fix/2011/10/judd-apatow-career-timeline|publisher=IFC.com|accessdate=November 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===1985–2003: Stand-up, early film and television work===
Apatow began performing stand-up comedy at age seventeen, during his senior year of high school.&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt; In the September 1985 issue of ''Laugh Factory Magazine'', he is listed as an Associate Editor. After graduating from high school in 1985, he moved to Los Angeles and enrolled in the screenwriting program at [[University of Southern California]].&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cinema.usc.edu/alumni/notable.cfm|title=Sampling of Notable USC Alumni Working in Cinema/Television/Interactive|publisher=USC School of Cinematic Arts|accessdate=December 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While at USC, he organized and hosted a number of on-campus "Comedy Night" events, featuring headliners such as ''Saturday Night Live'' performer [[Kevin Nealon]]. Apatow introduced the acts at these events with short standup routines of his own. He also began volunteering at (and later producing) benefit concerts for HBO's [[Comic Relief (charity)|Comic Relief]] and performing and seeing standup at [[the Improv]] in Hollywood.&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt; He dropped out of college during his second year and later moved into an apartment with comedian [[Adam Sandler]], whom he met at the Improv.&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt; He competed in the Johnnie Walker Comedy Search in 1989 directed by ''Saturday Night Live'' short film producer [[Neal Marshad]].&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;{{cite news|last=Abramowitz|first=Rachel|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-ca-apatow13may13,1,1056915.story|title=The king of Geeks|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=May 13, 2007|accessdate=June 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly thereafter, Apatow was introduced by manager Jimmy Miller to [[Garry Shandling]] which resulted in Apatow being hired as a writer for the [[Grammy Awards]] that year, which Shandling hosted.&lt;ref name="Daily Variety"&gt;{{cite news|last=Newman|first=Melinda|title=Man most likely to inspire|work=[[Daily Variety]]|date=October 29, 2012|accessdate=November 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, Apatow appeared on [[Home Box Office|HBO's]] ''15th Annual Young Comedians Special''&lt;ref name="wild"&gt;{{cite news|last=Michaels|first=Chad|title=Judd Apatow Interview|publisher=Wild About Movies|date=May 23, 2007|url=http://www.wildaboutmovies.com/interviews/Judd-Apatow-Interview.php|accessdate=June 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and shortly afterwards went on to co-create and executive produce ''[[The Ben Stiller Show]]'' for [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]. Apatow had met Stiller outside of an [[Elvis Costello]] concert in 1990, and they became friends. Despite critical acclaim and an [[Emmy Award]] for Apatow and the rest of the writing staff, Fox canceled the show in 1993.&lt;ref name="Vanity Fair"&gt;{{cite news|last=Marcus |first=Bennett|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/online/daily/2012/11/judd-apatow-ben-stiller-show-comedy |title=

Apatow went on to join HBO's ''[[The Larry Sanders Show]]'' in 1993 as a writer and consulting producer, and he later served as a co-executive producer and director of an episode during the show's final season in 1998. He credits Shandling as his mentor for influencing him to write comedy that is more character-driven.&lt;ref name="latimes"/&gt; Apatow earned six [[Emmy]] nominations for his work on Larry Sanders. During this same time, he worked as a consulting producer and staff writer for the animated show ''[[The Critic]]'', starring [[Jon Lovitz]].&lt;ref name="IFC"&gt;{{cite news|last=Locker|first=Melissa|url=http://www.ifc.com/fix/2010/12/12-days-of-judd-apatow-day-5-t|title=12 Days of Judd Apatow: Day 5 "The Critic"|work=IFC|date=December 21, 2010|accessdate=November 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, Apatow co-wrote (with Steve Brill) the feature film ''[[Heavyweights]]''. Around the same time, Apatow was hired to produce and do an uncredited re-write of the script for the movie ''[[The Cable Guy]]'', which was released in 1996 to mixed reviews.&lt;ref name="variety"&gt;{{cite news|last=Thompson|first=Anne|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117964732.html?categoryid=2508&amp;cs=1|title=Hot Apatow new king of comedy|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=May 11, 2007|accessdate=June 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was during the pre-production of the film that Apatow met his future wife, actress [[Leslie Mann]].&lt;ref name=actors/&gt; Apatow did uncredited re-writes on two other [[Jim Carrey]] films: ''[[Liar, Liar]]'' and ''[[Bruce Almighty]]''.&lt;ref name="E!

However, the film was never made.&lt;ref name="variety"/&gt; Apatow did uncredited rewrites of the [[Adam Sandler]] films ''[[Happy Gilmore]]'' and  ''[[The Wedding Singer]]''.&lt;ref name="variety"/&gt; He was also featured in four tracks on Sandler's 1996 comedy album "[[What the Hell Happened to Me?]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Eduardo Rivadavia (review)|title=What the Hell Happened to Me? - Adam Sandler|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/what-the-hell-happened-to-me-mw0000179861|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, Apatow created ''Sick in the Head'', a multi-camera sitcom pilot starring [[David Krumholtz]] as a psychiatrist on his first day on the job, [[Amy Poehler]] as a suicidal patient, and [[Kevin Corrigan]] as Krumholtz's slacker roommate.&lt;ref name="Splitsider"&gt;{{cite news|last=Evans|first=Bradford|url=http://splitsider.com/2011/05/the-lost-projects-of-judd-apatow|title=The Lost Projects of Judd Apatow|work=Splitsider|date=May 12, 2011|accessdate=November 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show was not picked up by Fox, which freed up Apatow to serve as an executive producer of the award-winning series ''[[Freaks and Geeks]]'', which debuted in 1999. He also wrote and directed several episodes of the series. After its cancellation, Apatow was the executive producer and creator of the series ''[[Undeclared]]'', which reused [[Seth Rogen]] in the main cast and other ''Freaks and Geeks'' cast members in recurring roles. Although both shows were quickly canceled, ''[[USA Today]]'' media critic Susan Wloszczyna called the shows "two of the most acclaimed TV series to ever last only one season."&lt;ref name="usatoday"&gt;{{cite news|last=Wloszczyna|first=Susan|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2007-05-06-judd-apatow_N.htm|title=For Apatow, opportunity knocks|work=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=June 4, 2007|date=May 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Apatow created ''Julie'', a pilot of his that featured [[Jason Segel]], [[Kevin Hart (actor)|Kevin Hart]], [[Seth Rogen]], [[Phil Hendrie]], and [[Judge Reinhold]] (playing himself). The pilot was not picked up by Fox.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} In 2002, he co-wrote (with [[Brent Forrester]]) a Fox pilot titled ''Life on Parole'', starring [[David Herman]] as a dissatisfied [[parole officer]] whose roommate happens to be one of his parolees; it was not picked up. Apatow has screened and introduced them at "The Other Network", a festival of un-aired TV pilots produced by [[Un-Cabaret]].&lt;ref name="Splitsider"/&gt; He reunited with [[Jason Segel]] and [[Amy Poehler]] for the 2001 Fox sitcom pilot, ''North Hollywood''.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

===2004–2008: ''The 40-Year-Old Virgin'', ''Knocked Up'', and producing===
In 2004, Apatow [[film producer|produced]] the feature film comedy ''[[Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy]]'', starring [[Will Ferrell]] and directed by [[Adam McKay]].&lt;ref name=actors/&gt; The film was a box office success.

The film opened at number one at the box office and grossed more than $175 million globally.&lt;ref name="variety"/&gt; The comedy garnered numerous awards and nominations, including being named one of [[American Film Institute|AFI]]'s Top Movies of the Year, as well as taking home Best Comedy Movie at the 11th annual Critics' Choice Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AFI Announces Their Selection of 2005's Best Movies|publisher=About.com|date=August 18, 2006|url=http://movies.about.com/od/awards/a/afi12005121105.htm|accessdate=November 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The 40-Year-Old Virgin'' also earned Apatow a nomination for Best Original Screenplay from the [[Writers Guild of America]] and received four [[MTV Movie Award]] nominations, including a win for Carell for Best Comedic Performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Buckalew|first=Brett|title=No Longer a Feature Film ''Virgin''|publisher=Filmstew.com|date=August 18, 2006|url=http://www.filmstew.com/showArticle.aspx?ContentID=14646|accessdate=June 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His second film, the romantic comedy ''[[Knocked Up]]'', was released in June 2007 to wide critical acclaim. Apatow wrote the initial draft of the film on the set of ''[[Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby|Talladega Nights]]''.&lt;ref name="latimes"/&gt; The story concerns a slacker and a media personality (Rogen and Heigl, respectively) whose [[one-night stand]] results in an  unintended pregnancy. In addition to being a critical success, the film was also a commercial hit, continuing Apatow's newfound mainstream success.

In August 2007, Apatow produced the film ''[[Superbad (film)|Superbad]]'', which was written by [[Seth Rogen]] and his writing partner [[Evan Goldberg]]. A concept Rogen and Goldberg had created as teens, Apatow convinced Rogen to write the film as a vehicle for himself in 2000. Rogen and Goldberg finished writing the film, but were unable to find a studio interested in producing it. Apatow then enlisted Rogen and Goldberg to write ''[[Pineapple Express (film)|Pineapple Express]]'', a [[Drug culture|stoner]] action movie that he felt would be more commercial. After the success of ''Anchorman'' and ''The 40-Year-Old Virgin'', Apatow was still unable to sell both ''Superbad'' and ''Pineapple Express''; it was only after he produced the commercial hit ''[[Talladega Nights]]'' that [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]] decided to produce both.&lt;ref name="variety"/&gt;

At this point, Rogen was unable to play the lead for ''Superbad'', as he had grown too old to play the part of Seth. Subsequently, he was cast in a supporting role as a police officer and friend [[Jonah Hill]] took his role as the high school student. Apatow credits Rogen for influencing him to make his work more "outrageously dirty."&lt;ref name="latimes"/&gt;

In August 2007, ''Superbad'' opened at No. 1 in the box office to critical acclaim, taking in $33 million in its opening weekend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Coyle |first=Jake |title=How Did 'Superbad' Top the Box Office? |work=NewsOK |agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=August 21, 2007 |url=http://newsok.com/article/3107893}}&lt;/ref&gt; Industry insiders claimed Apatow was now a brand unto himself, creating movies geared toward older audiences, who would watch his movies even when the films delved into the teen genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dergarabedian|first=Paul|title=Paul D.

Apatow served as producer and co-writer along with director [[Jake Kasdan]] for the biopic spoof ''[[Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story|Walk Hard]]'' starring [[John C.

Apatow retracted his support for the movie, feeling it was not what he had initially envisioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brevet|first1=Brad|title=Judd Apatow Disowns ‘Drillbit Taylor’|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/movies/news/525670-judd_apatow_disowns_drillbit_taylor|website=[[ComingSoon.net]]|accessdate=July 29, 2016|date=March 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the rest of 2008, Apatow produced the comedy films ''[[Forgetting Sarah Marshall]]'' starring [[Jason Segel]] and [[Kristen Bell]]; ''[[Step Brothers (film)|Step Brothers]]'', which reunites ''Talladega Nights'' co-stars [[Will Ferrell]] and [[John C. Reilly]]; and ''[[Pineapple Express (film)|Pineapple Express]]'' starring Seth Rogen and [[James Franco]], both of whom originally starred on ''Freaks and Geeks''. In addition, he served as co-writer for the [[Adam Sandler]] comedy film ''[[You Don't Mess with the Zohan]]'', which Sandler and [[Robert Smigel]] also co-wrote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Leitch|first1=Will|last2=Grierson|first2=Tim|title=Every Judd Apatow Movie, Ranked From Worst to Best|url=http://www.vulture.com/2015/07/every-apatow-movie-ranked-from-worst-to-best.html|website=Vulture|publisher=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|accessdate=July 29, 2016|date=June 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He tries to keep a low budget on his projects and usually makes his movies about the work itself rather than using big stars. After his success in film, he hired the entire writing staff from ''Undeclared'' to write movies for [[Apatow Productions]].&lt;ref name="latimes"/&gt; He never fires writers and he keeps them on projects through all stages of productions, known colloquially as "the comedy wheel."&lt;ref name="latimes"/&gt; Apatow is not committed to any specific studio, but his projects are typically set up at [[Universal Pictures|Universal]] and [[Sony Pictures Entertainment|Sony]],&lt;ref name="latimes"/&gt; and in 2009 ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported that Universal had signed him to a 3 picture directing deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fleming|first=Michael|title=Universal embraces Judd Apatow|work=Variety|date=July 30, 2009|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118006715?refCatId=13|accessdate=December 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apatow once vowed to include a penis in every one of his movies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Branney|first=John|title=Is Hollywood A No-Members Club|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=August 26, 2008|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2008/aug/26/hasthefigleaffallen|accessdate=April 23, 2009|quote=In an attempt to rid America of its phallophobia, Judd Apatow once vowed to include a penis in every one of his movies. |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; He explained his position as, "I like movies that are, you know, uplifting and hopeful...and I like filth!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Walker|first=Tim|title=King of bromance: Judd Apatow|work=The Independent|date=August 19, 2009|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/king-of-bromance-judd-apatow-1773842.html|accessdate=November 14, 2010|quote=Says Apatow: "I like movies that are, you know, up-lifting and hopeful ... and I like filth."|location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Funny People 6807.jpg|thumb|left|Apatow (right) with [[Leslie Mann]] and [[Adam Sandler]] in Berlin (2009)]]
In 2009, Apatow served as producer for the biblical comedy film ''[[Year One (film)|Year one]]''; the film was not well received.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Year One (2009)|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/year_one/|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also released his third directorial feature on July 31 that same year, titled ''[[Funny People]]''. Apatow wrote the film, which starred [[Adam Sandler]] and [[Seth Rogen]] as a pair of standup comedians, one of whom has a terminal illness. Other co-stars included his wife [[Leslie Mann]] and [[Eric Bana]], who was a comedic actor in Australia before appearing in American films. The film contained more dramatic elements than Apatow's previous directorial efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1588439/20080531/story.jhtml|title=Adam Sandler To Star in Judd Apatow Movie About Stand-Up Comics|date=May 31, 2008|first=Shawn|last=Adler|publisher=MTV|accessdate=September 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the film was not financially successful (grossing $54 million domestically), the critical reception was primarily positive, with David Denby of [[New Yorker Magazine]] including the film on his top ten films of 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Denby|first=David|title=The Ten Best Films of 2009|work=The New Yorker|date=December 3, 2009|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/tny/2009/12/denby-top-films-2009.html|accessdate=December 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; calling ''[[Funny People]]'' "a serious comedy about a funny man's brush with death" and stating that the film "is Apatow's richest, most complicated movie yet—a summing up of his feelings about comedy and its relation to the rest of existence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Denby|first=David |title=Funny People Review|work=The New Yorker|date=August 3, 2009 |url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/cinema/2009/08/03/090803crci_cinema_denby|accessdate=December 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[New York Times]]'' critic [[A.O. Scott]], reflecting on summer films of 2009, opined that ''Funny People'' was "a movie about growing up, feeling sad, facing death—a long, serious film whose subject is the challenge of maturity. Which may be why, in the face of a softish opening weekend, various interpreters of box office data were quick to declare ''Funny People'' a flop.

In 2010, Apatow served as producer on the ''Forgetting Sarah Marshall'' spin-off ''[[Get Him to the Greek]]'' with [[Russell Brand]] reprising his role and [[Jonah Hill]] returning from the original film, albeit as a different character. Released by Universal, the film did well at the box office, grossing more than 60 million dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Get Him to the Greek|publisher=Box Office Mojo.com|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=gethimtothegreek.htm|accessdate=December 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Apatow produced the most successful R-rated female comedy of all time, ''[[Bridesmaids (2011 film)|Bridesmaids]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bridesmaids|publisher=Box Office Mojo.com|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=wiigapatow.htm|accessdate=December 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which received [[Oscar Award|Oscar]] nominations for Best Supporting Actress ([[Melissa McCarthy]]) and Best Original Screenplay ([[Annie Mumolo]] and [[Kristen Wiig]]), as well as two [[Golden Globe Award]] nominations and two [[Screen Actors Guild Award]] nominations. ''Bridesmaids'' also won a Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Comedy Movie, a [[People's Choice Award]] for Favorite Comedy Movie and was named one of AFI's Movies of the Year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bridesmaids|work=Rotten Tomatoes|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/bridesmaids_2011|accessdate=December 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, he produced ''[[Girls (TV series)|Girls]]'' after seeing [[Lena Dunham]]'s 2010 film ''[[Tiny Furniture]]''. In a January 2013 interview in [[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]], Apatow and Dunham discussed the creative process of working on the show, saying that "this type of show is an auteur's vision.

Earlier that year, Apatow produced Chris Gethard’s HBO comedy special Career Suicide, an hour and a half long monologue about Gethard’s experience with depression, therapy and search for fulfillment. The program was described as being able to “articulate intense and often ineffable emotion” while still remaining “brazenly candid...and packed with great jokes.” In a review for the A.V.

The special was recorded during the [[Just for Laughs]] comedy festival in [[Montreal]], Canada the previous July and released through Netflix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Holloway|first1=Daniel|title=Judd Apatow on Returning to Stand-Up Comedy After 25 Years|url=https://variety.com/2017/tv/features/judd-apatow-netflix-comedy-special-1202630291/|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=December 15, 2017|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apatow also had a cameo role in [[The Disaster Artist]] (2017), which chronicles the making of the film [[The Room (film)|The Room]] &lt;ref&gt;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/rambling-reporter/judd-apatow-name-checks-real-life-agent-disaster-artist-1062113&lt;/ref&gt;''[[The New Yorker]]'' critic [[Richard Brody]] felt the role was a "reminder" that Apatow should play a lead in one of his own films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brody|first1=Richard|authorlink1=Richard Brody|title=Why "The Room" Is A Better Movie Than James Franco's "The Disaster Artist"|url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/why-the-room-is-a-better-movie-than-james-francos-the-disaster-artist|website=[[The New Yorker]]|accessdate=December 15, 2017|date=December 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with documentarian Michael Bonfiglio, Apatow co-directed the documentary ''May It Last: A Portrait Of The Avett Brothers'', which chronicles the making of the [[The Avett Brothers|titular band's]] album ''[[True Sadness]]''. It aired on HBO in January 2018 and later won the SXSW Audience Award at the SXSW film festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Menconi|first1=David|title=The Avett Brothers’ documentary set to screen on HBO|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/entertainment/music-news-reviews/on-the-beat-blog/article172824341.html|website=[[The News &amp; Observer]]|accessdate=March 28, 2018|date=January 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sxsw.com/film/2017/sxsw-film-festival-audience-award-winner-may-last-portrait-avett-brothers-now-available-video/&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in 2018, he directed another HBO documentary, ''[[The Zen Diaries of Garry Shandling]]'', exploring the life and legacy of the then-recently deceased comedian [[Garry Shandling]], one of Apatow's idols and a close friend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gilbert|first1=Sophie|title=The Zen Diaries of Garry Shandling Is a Eulogy Worth Watching|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/03/the-zen-diaries-of-garry-shandling-review-hbo/556583/|website=[[The Atlantic]]|accessdate=March 28, 2018|date=March 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Debate===
In 2007 ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine noted that [former Apatow associate] [[Mike White (scriptwriter)|Mike White]] ... was "disenchanted" by Apatow's later films, "objecting to the treatment of women and gay men in Apatow's recent movies", saying of ''Knocked Up'': "At some point it starts feeling like comedy of the bullies, rather than the bullied."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2007/05/mike_white_calls_out_judd_apat.html |title=Mike White Calls Out Judd Apatow |work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |date=May 7, 2007 |accessdate=December 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a highly publicized ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' interview, lead actress [[Katherine Heigl]] admitted that though she enjoyed working with Apatow, she had a hard time enjoying ''Knocked Up'' herself, calling the movie "a little sexist", saying that the film "paints the women as shrews, as humorless and uptight". In response to accusations of sexism, Apatow told an interviewer that the characters in the film ''Knocked Up'' "are sexist at times... but it's really about immature people who are afraid of women and relationships and learn to grow up."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2007/12/marketing_genius_judd_apatow_t.html |title=Marketing Genius Judd Apatow Turns Katherine Heigl's 'Knocked Up' Slam into a Sales Pitch |work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |date=December 6, 2007 |accessdate=December 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kristen Wiig]], in a speech presenting Apatow with the Herb Sargent Award for Comedy Excellence in February 2012 said that he was an "incredible collaborator and supporter"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.laughspin.com/2012/02/20/watch-kristen-wiig-introduce-judd-apatow-and-then-watch-judd-apatows-comedy-award-acceptance-speech/ |title=Watch Kristen Wiig introduce Judd Apatow and Judd Apatow's comedy award speech|work=LaughSpin |date=February 12, 2012 |accessdate=December 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in a 2011 interview with ''[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]'', television actress and writer [[Lena Dunham]], who has collaborated often with Apatow said of his work, "''Knocked Up'' is really about love. ... His movies are about people trying to get closer to themselves. He's the perfect match for a story about being 25, because that's all 25-year-olds are interested in. The other problems they encounter—money issues, conflicts at work—don't matter."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elle.com/pop-culture/celebrities/comedys-unlikely-feminist-3 |title=Judd Apatow, Comedy's Unlikely Feminist |work=[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]] |date=October 27, 2011 |accessdate=December 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alyssa Rosenberg of ''[[ThinkProgress]]'' praised Apatow for his "wonderfully refreshing" approach to women and comedy, quoting Apatow as saying "I got bored of penises. I said, 'enough of that.' No, I just like immaturity, I like to show people struggle and try to figure out who they are. I'm a guy and so it leaned guy for a while. But one of the projects I'm most proud of is ''Freaks and Geeks'', which is about a woman in high school struggling to figure out which group she wants to belong to, so for me, it goes back and forth. ..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thinkprogress.org/alyssa/2012/04/09/459940/judd-apatow-is-the-cure-for-the-common-lee-aronsohn/?mobile=nc|title=Judd Apatow Is the Cure for the Common Lee Aronsohn |publisher=[[ThinkProgress]] |date=April 9, 2012 |accessdate=December 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apatow and his family live in [[Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt;

===Philanthropy===
Apatow's philanthropic work includes supporting the literacy organization [[826LA]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kellogg|first= Carolyn|title= 826LA adds Pee-wee Herman to Judd Apatow benefit | url= http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/jacketcopy/2012/05/826la-pee-wee-herman-judd-apatow-benefit.html |accessdate=December 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Bogart Pediatric Cancer Research Program, and Children's Cancer Research Center at Children's hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kay |first=Felix |title=Judd Apatow &amp; Leslie Mann Honored For Work For Kids |url=http://www.younghollywood.com/scene/judd-apatow-leslie-mann-honored-for-work-for-kids.html|accessdate=December 14, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121027052602/http://www.younghollywood.com/scene/judd-apatow-leslie-mann-honored-for-work-for-kids.html|archivedate=October 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He edited the book ''I Found This Funny'' published by [[McSweeneys]] to benefit 826LA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=McSweeney's Store|url=https://store.mcsweeneys.net/products/i-found-this-funny|accessdate=December 14, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105194343/https://store.mcsweeneys.net/products/i-found-this-funny|archivedate=November 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Apatow’s book, “Sick in the Head”, in which he interviews comedy icons such as Jerry Seinfeld and Jay Leno, benefitted the 826LA organization.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/olivia-wilde-paul-rudd-judd-724902&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.latimes.com/books/jacketcopy/la-ca-jc-judd-apatow-20150621-story.html&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Judd has also received several high profile awards for his advocacy and support of women in Hollywood, as well as victims of sexual assault. In 2015, he was honored by the Rape Treatment Foundation, who later released a statement on Apatow’s contributions, describing him as “a powerful voice for the truths about rape and an advocate for respectful treatment of victims.”&lt;ref&gt;http://therapefoundation.org/2016/04/the-rape-foundation-2015-annual-brunch/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Apatow was awarded the ACLU Bill of Rights Award, for being “an outspoken and tireless advocate on behalf of women in the arts.&lt;ref&gt;https://deadline.com/2017/11/aclu-southern-california-awards-judd-apatow-viola-davis-jane-fonda-gina-rodriguez-reginald-hudlin-dolores-huerta-1202201350/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allegations of hypocrisy===
Apatow has positioned himself at the forefront of the "#MeToo" and "#TimesUp" online movements, encouraging alleged victims to come forward while also heavily criticising people accused without [[due process]]. Apatow had strong words for people like [[Bill Cosby]] and those who gave Cosby a platform to continue to perform and speak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Business Insider|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/judd-apatow-blasts-bill-cosby-2015-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Judd Apatow blasts Centre in the Square for hosting Bill Cosby|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/judd-apatow-blasts-centre-in-the-square-for-hosting-bill-cosby-1.2884922|website=cbc.com|publisher=CBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been criticized, however, for staying quiet about people accused within his own circles, such as [[James Franco]] and his mentor [[Garry Shandling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Judd Apatow has been vocal against Bill Cosby.
