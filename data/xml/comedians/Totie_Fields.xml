'''Totie Fields''' (May 7, 1930 – August 2, 1978) was an [[United States|American]] [[comedian]].&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;{{cite news| title=Totie Fields eulogized for paving way for women| url=http://www.amanandamouse.com/blogspot/totie/totieEulogize.jpg| date=August 3, 1978| work=[[The Register-Guard|Eugene Register-Guard]]| accessdate=July 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

==Early life==
Fields was born '''Sophie Feldman''' in [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]], [[Connecticut]]. She started singing in [[Boston]] clubs while still in high school, taking the stage name of Totie Fields. The name "Totie" was a childhood nickname, a [[baby talk|baby-talk]] pronunciation of the name "Sophie".{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

==Career==
Fields gained fame during the 1960s and 1970s.  [[Ed Sullivan]] gave Fields her first big break when he booked her on his show after seeing her perform at the [[Copacabana (nightclub)|Copacabana]] in [[New York, New York|New York]].  She made multiple appearances on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', ''[[The Mike Douglas Show]]'', and ''[[The Merv Griffin Show]]'', as well as a fifth-season episode of ''[[Here's Lucy]]'' starring [[Lucille Ball]].

In 1972, Fields wrote a humorous diet book titled ''I Think I'll Start on Monday: The Official 8½ Oz. Mashed Potato Diet''.&lt;ref name="dietbook"&gt;Fields, Totie (1972). I Think I'll Start on Monday: The Official 8½ oz. Mashed Potato Diet. New York: Hawthorn Books, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health problems==
Fields was plagued with health problems the last two years of her life.

In April 1976, her left leg was [[amputation|amputated]] above the knee when surgery to remove a [[blood clot]] failed. This caused her to use a scooter for mobility. Fields' last television appearance before her surgery was in a rare straight dramatic guest-starring role on the CBS-TV drama series ''[[Medical Center (TV series)|Medical Center]]'', which aired on February 23, 1976. In that episode, "Life, Death, and Mrs. Armbruster", Fields played Phoebe Armbruster, a hospital janitor plagued by heart problems.

In June 1977  a much-thinner Fields starred in the [[Home Box Office]] special series ''[[Standing Room Only (TV series)|Standing Room Only]]'', beginning her show seated in a [[wheelchair]].&lt;ref&gt;''HBO Program Guide''&lt;/ref&gt;  As the audience welcomed her, she stood up, causing the cheering audience to stand with her.  Said Fields: "I've waited all my life to say this ... I weigh less than [[Elizabeth Taylor]]!"

While still recovering from the amputation, Fields suffered{{When|date=October 2009}} two [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]]s.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

In October 1977, Fields was diagnosed with [[breast cancer]] and her right breast was removed. However, Fields continued to perform, incorporating her health problems into her act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| date=August 3, 1978| title=Totie Fields Rotund Comic Was Entertainer of Year| work=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, this changed the tone of her humor. Actor [[Van Johnson]], who was a friend of Fields, was said to have remarked, "When Totie lost weight, she wasn't funny anymore."

Nevertheless, in 1978, during the last year of her life, Fields was voted "Entertainer of the Year" and "Female Comedy Star of the Year" by the American Guild of Variety Artists.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

===Death===
On August 2, 1978, Fields was scheduled to begin a two-week engagement at Las Vegas’ [[Sahara Hotel]] when, on the eve of the opening, she was stricken at home by a blood clot, suffering a fatal [[pulmonary embolism]]. She was rushed to nearby [[Sunrise Hospital &amp; Medical Center]], but was pronounced dead soon after.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news ||title=Totie Fields Dead. Comedienne was 48 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1978/08/03/archives/totie-fields-dead-comedienne-was-48-obese-raucousvoiced-nightclub.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=August 3, 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her ashes were interred in Las Vegas; after her husband George Johnston's death in January 1995, her remains were moved to the [[Mount Sinai Memorial Park Cemetery]] in [[Los Angeles]], to be interred together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Totie Fields| url=https://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=4515| publisher=[[Find a Grave]]| date=February 10, 1999| accessdate=July 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
