'''David Norris Brenner''' (February 4, 1936&amp;nbsp;– March 15, 2014) was an American stand-up comedian, actor and author. The most frequent guest on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' in the 1970s and 1980s, Brenner "was a pioneer of [[observational comedy]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2014/03/david-brenner-1936-2014.html| title=David Brenner: 1936-2014| first=Ryan| last=Bort| date=March 17, 2014| journal=[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Brenner was born to Jewish parents in 1936&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.howardstern.com/howard-on-air/howard-100-101/2005-02-04#gallery-17432 Happy birthday Brenner!] Howard Stern&lt;/ref&gt; and raised in poor areas of [[South Philadelphia|South]] and [[West Philadelphia|West]] [[Philadelphia]].&lt;ref name=hr/&gt; His father, Louis, was a [[vaudeville]] comedian, singer and dancer performing under the stage name of Lou Murphy, who gave up his career and a film contract, to please Brenner's grandfather, a rabbi, who objected to his working on the Sabbath.&lt;ref name=hr/&gt; Once he became successful, Brenner regularly sent his parents on cruises, and both of Brenner's parents would eventually die at advanced ages while on cruises aboard the [[Queen Elizabeth 2]], approximately two years apart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7-eG3sRrw0 |title=Interview with David Brenner: "Always Leave 'Em Laughing" |publisher=Reel Change Films |date=June 29, 2012 |accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After high school, Brenner spent two years in the U.S. Army, serving in the 101st Airborne and as a cryptographer of the 595th [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|Signal Corps]] in [[Böblingen]], Germany. After being discharged, he attended [[Temple University]], where he majored in mass communication and graduated with honors.&lt;ref name=hr/&gt;

==Career==
Brenner was a writer, director or producer of 115 television documentaries and headed the documentary units of [[Westinghouse Broadcasting]] and [[Metromedia]], winning nearly 30 awards including an [[Emmy]], before moving to comedy.&lt;ref name=hr/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.davidbrennersite.com/bio.html |title=The Brenner Accounting Blog |work=The Brenner Accounting Blog |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140316093017/http://www.davidbrennersite.com/bio.html |archivedate=March 16, 2014 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; His first paid gig was at [[The Improv]] in June 1969, and following that he frequently performed at clubs in [[Greenwich Village]].&lt;ref name=hr/&gt; After making his national television debut in 1971, on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'', he became the show's most frequent guest, with 158 appearances. He guest-hosted for [[Johnny Carson]] 75 times between 1975 and 1984, placing him fifth on the list of Carson's most frequent guest hosts. Brenner was ranked No. 53 on ''[[Comedy Central]] Presents: 100 Greatest Stand-Ups of All Time''. At one point, he had appeared more often on major TV talk shows than any other entertainer.&lt;ref&gt;The Book of Lists #2 p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote five books,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.amazon.com/David-Brenner/e/B001HMQS6A| title=Amazon.com: David Brenner: Books, Biography, Blog, Audiobooks, Kindle| publisher=| accessdate=February 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and starred in four [[HBO]] Specials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20797387,00.html| title=David Brenner Dies of Cancer at 78| journal=[[People (magazine)|People]]| agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brenner released the comedy album ''Excuse Me, Are You Reading That Paper?'' on [[MCA Records]] in 1983 (The title arose from a gag wherein a fellow passenger on a subway asked Brenner if he was reading a newspaper on which he was sitting. The punch line was Brenner saying he was, standing up, turning a page, and sitting down again.) Brenner also penned five books&lt;ref name=hr/&gt; including ''Soft Pretzels With Mustard'' (1983), ''Revenge is the Best Exercise'' (1984), ''Nobody Ever Sees You Eat Tuna Fish'' (1986), ''If God Wanted Us to Travel...'' (1990), and ''I Think There's a Terrorist in My Soup: How to Survive Personal and World Problems with Laughter—Seriously'' (2003) which was also released as two audiobooks.

Brenner was the star of the 1976 TV series ''[[Snip (TV series)|Snip]]'' (alternative title: ''Flip''), which was inspired by the film ''[[Shampoo (film)|Shampoo]]'' and set in a hair dressing salon.&lt;ref name=hr/&gt; The situation comedy was cancelled by NBC before it aired due to its inclusion in the supporting cast of what would have been [[List of situation comedies with LGBT characters|one of the first]] gay characters in an American situation comedy. He also played a charity ball auctioneer in the 1989 romantic comedy ''[[Worth Winning]]'' (with [[Mark Harmon]], [[Madeleine Stowe]], and [[Lesley Ann Warren]], who was also Brenner's co-star on ''Snip'').&lt;ref name=hr/&gt;

In 1986, [[King World Entertainment]] gave Brenner his own 30-minute syndicated [[late-night talk show]], ''[[Nightlife (TV series)|Nightlife]]'', in an attempt to compete with Carson, but it was cancelled after one season. The show premiered September 8, 1986, on 102 stations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1144&amp;dat=19861129&amp;id=gYMcAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=_WIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5351,2961830| title= And the latenight winner is...| newspaper=[[Pittsburgh Press]]| date=November 29, 1986| first=Lee| last=Winfrey| accessdate=March 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was touted as "[[Alternative comedy|alternative]]".&lt;ref name=b/&gt; Filmed in [[Manhattan]] and featuring a casually dressed Brenner,&lt;ref name=b/&gt; it was unique among the late night talk genre for not having a monologue.&lt;ref name=b&gt;{{cite news| url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1901&amp;dat=19860829&amp;id=QVQgAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=UtIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1495,8343291| title= Brenner Waking Up 'Nightlife' With Own Late Show| first=Michael E.| last=Hill| newspaper=The News-Journal| location=Daytona Beach| agency=[[Los Angeles Times–Washington Post News Service]]| date=August 29, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; It gave some comedians, such as [[Bobby Slayton]], their national television premieres.&lt;ref name="hollywoodreporter.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/david-brenner-dead-comedian-bobby-688892| title=David Brenner Dead: Comedian Bobby Slayton Remembers His Friend| first=Kimberly| last=Nordyke| newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter| date=March 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the ''Tonight Show'', Brenner also appeared on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', ''[[David Frost|The David Frost Show]]'', ''[[The Mike Douglas Show]]'', ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'' and the ''[[Late Show With David Letterman]]'', ''[[Real Time With Bill Maher]]'' and ''[[The Daily Show]]'' and was a frequent guest on ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]''.&lt;ref name=hr/&gt; In later years he appeared on both [[MSNBC]] and [[Fox News Channel]] shows commenting on current events.&lt;ref name=apobit/&gt; 

The [[Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia]] named Brenner their Person of the Year in 1984 and inducted him into their Hall of Fame in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Person of the Year Recipients: David Brenner |website=[[Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia]] |url=http://www.broadcastpioneers.com/davidbrenner.html |accessdate=October 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1994 to 1996, Brenner hosted a talk-radio program, taking over the timeslot of the long-running ''[[Larry King Show]]'' on the [[Mutual Broadcasting System]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-06-24/entertainment/ca-8138_1_talk-radio| title=Today's Talk-Radio Topic: The Future of Talk Radio| first=Claudia| last=Puig| work=[[Los Angeles Times]]| date=June 24, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.allaccess.com/net-news/archive/story/127831/david-brenner-dies-top-comedian-hosted-radio-show- |title=David Brenner Dies; Top Comedian Hosted Radio Show In '90s |work=All Access |date=March 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had earlier hosted a syndicated weekly radio show, ''David Brenner Live'', for three months in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yCQEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PT20&amp;lpg=PT20&amp;dq=%22david+brenner+live%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=9IY33GuRB-&amp;sig=3B0U5yYzhTJ_qfNsrJ2E28Oo45I&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=WGiBVJyEOISgyQT0iYG4DQ&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22david%20brenner%20live%22&amp;f=false| title=Radio: Featured Programming| journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]| date=August 31, 1985| accessdate=March 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1915&amp;dat=19851102&amp;id=CjdSAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=SzYNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1498,266783| title=David Brenner show on radio is dropped| date=November 2, 1985| newspaper=[[The Day (New London)|The Day]]| location=New London, Connecticut| accessdate=March 6, 2018| agency=Knight-Ridder News Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His friend, comedian [[Richard Lewis (comedian)|Richard Lewis]], described Brenner as "the king of hip, observational comedy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Comedian David Brenner dead at 78| url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2014-03-15/news/chi-comedian-david-brenner-dead-20140315_1_comedian-david-brenner-johnny-carson-documentaries| accessdate=March 16, 2014| newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]| date=March 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Brenner had three children—Cole, Slade and Wyatt.&lt;ref&gt;''David Brenner: Back with a Vengeance!'', 2000, HBO.&lt;/ref&gt; He and the mother of Cole, his first son, fought a custody battle for several years. Brenner finally won child custody in 1992. Because family courts would have regarded him as an absentee father if he were away from home more than 50 nights a year, Brenner substantially reduced the number of appearances in his stand-up comedy work, including performances on the ''Tonight Show'' in order to secure and maintain custody of his son.&lt;ref name=hr /&gt;&lt;ref name=apobit&gt;{{cite news| title=Comedian David Brenner, 'Tonight' favorite, dies| url=https://news.yahoo.com/comedian-david-brenner-tonight-favorite-dies-222814425.html| accessdate=March 16, 2014| agency=[[Associated Press]]| date=March 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Brenner married Elizabeth Slater of New York, the mother of his sons Slade and Wyatt, in the closing minutes of his ''David Brenner: Back with a Vengeance!'' HBO Special recorded in Las Vegas, on February 19, 2000. They divorced a little over a year later and also then fought two custody battles, both of which Brenner won. Brenner was engaged to [[Tai Babilonia]] in 2005, but they never married.&lt;ref name=hr /&gt;&lt;ref name=apobit /&gt; For a while in the 2000s, Brenner lived in [[Las Vegas]].&lt;ref name="hollywoodreporter.com" /&gt;

==Death==
Brenner died on March 15, 2014, at age 78 from [[pancreatic cancer]] at his [[Manhattan]] home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.tmz.com/2014/03/15/tonight-show-david-brenner-dead-dies-cancer/| title='Tonight Show' Legend David Brenner -- On Death Bed| work=[[TMZ]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://reviewjournal.com/columns-blogs/news/comedy-legend-david-brenner-dead-78| title=Comedy Legend David Brenner Dead At 78| first=Norm| last=Clarke| newspaper=[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]]| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140316033659/http://www.reviewjournal.com/columns-blogs/news/comedy-legend-david-brenner-dead-78| archivedate=March 16, 2014| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=usobit&gt;{{cite news| title=David Brenner, Comedian and Actor, Dies at the Age of 78| url=http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/david-brenner-comedian-and-actor-dies-at-the-age-of-78-2014153#ixzz2w9WhnlUv| accessdate=March 16, 2014| first=Stephanie| last=Webber| newspaper=[[Us Weekly]]| date=March 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
