==Early life==
McManus was born in [[Perth, Western Australia]], to John and Coralie McManus. McManus attended Orana Catholic Primary School before going through grades 8–12 at [[Corpus Christi College, Perth|Corpus Christi College]]. He acquired the nickname "Rove" as a child, from his sister.&lt;ref name="Enough Rope"&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/tv/enoughrope/transcripts/s879160.htm "Rove McManus"], ''Enough Rope ABC TV'', 9 June 2003. Retrieved 6 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performing career==

===Live comedy===
McManus is a long established exponent of stand up comedy, touring nationally and also appearing internationally at major events such as the 2010 Just For Laughs Festival in Montreal and as the host of the 2013 International Comedy Gala.

In 2005 and 2008 McManus undertook live stand-up comedy shows, touring Australian capital cities as well as [[Wellington]] and [[Auckland]] in New Zealand. During the tour he returned to Melbourne each Tuesday to film ''Rove Live''.

===Television===
McManus's first recorded television appearance was as a child, when he appeared in the ABC television series, 'Kaboodle' as 'Marty', in an episode called 'Marty Makes A Move'.&lt;ref name="Enough Rope" /&gt;

In 1997 McManus began hosting [[The Loft Live]], which was produced by [[RMIT University]]'s [[Student television station]] [[RMITV]], on the community television station, [[Channel 31 (Australia)|Channel 31]], where according to Rove he was given a budget of $50 per week. It was there where he met his now long-time co-host, [[Peter Helliar]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}  Rove then worked for [[Foxtel]] as a roving reporter on a show called ''In Fashion'' which was hosted by [[Hugh Jackman]]. He then took an offer from the [[Nine Network]] for ten late night episodes of his own variety show; ''[[Rove (TV series)|Rove]]'', in 1999, but Nine cancelled the series at the end of its run. In 2000, McManus was offered the opportunity to produce a new version of the ''Rove'' show for [[Network Ten]]. The resulting ''[[Rove (TV series)|Rove Live]]'' was almost identical to Nine's ''Rove''. ''Rove Live'' became a flagship show for Network Ten, and it was also broadcast on [[TV3 (New Zealand)|TV3]] in New Zealand. The show followed a variety show format and showcased weekly celebrity guests; comedy acts; variety segments; local and international comedians; and [[band (music)|live bands]].

During the [[Australian federal election, 2004|2004]] and [[Australian federal election, 2007|2007]] federal elections, McManus unsuccessfully campaigned to have the [[Prime Minister of Australia|Australian prime minister]], [[John Howard]], appear on his program. While Howard did not appear, then-opposition leaders [[Mark Latham]] appeared on the show in 2005 and [[Kevin Rudd]] in 2007. After being elected prime minister, Rudd appeared on the show again in 2008 and also on 28 June 2009.

When [[Bert Newton]] fell ill in early 2004, McManus was one of many guest presenters who hosted Newton's ''[[Good Morning Australia (1992–2005)|Good Morning Australia]]'' program. McManus hosted the episodes on 24 April and 12 October 2004. The following year, McManus and Newton co-hosted a Roving Enterprises television special ''Ten Seriously 40'', a look at the history of the Ten Network.

In 2004, McManus appeared in comedian [[John Safran]]'s TV show ''[[John Safran vs God]]'' in a segment in which Safran convinced the controversial UK Muslim cleric [[Omar Bakri Muhammad]] to put a [[fatwa]] on McManus. The fatwa was later taken off when Omar Bakri found out that the pictures showing McManus mocking Islam were falsified.

In November 2006, after his wife [[Belinda Emmett]] died after fighting breast cancer for eight years, McManus took indefinite leave and ''Rove Live'' did not screen its last two planned episodes of the year. At the time there were unfounded rumours circulating in the industry that he might quit television for good. He returned, however, in the competitive Sunday 8.30&amp;nbsp;pm timeslot on 1 April 2007 with a major format overhaul, including renaming the show to simply ''Rove''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,21343387-661,00.html |title = Rove back in harness |accessdate = 7 September 2007 |author = Darren Devlyn and Marcus Casey |date = 8 March 2007 |publisher = [[Herald Sun]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Rove'' scored its highest ever audience of 1.69 million viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=94668 |title = Kate Ritchie wins gold at Logies |accessdate = 7 September 2007 |date = 7 May 2007 |publisher = [[ninemsn]] |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070905120840/http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=94668 |archivedate = 5 September 2007 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2007, McManus made his debut as a game show host in the Australian version of the [[Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?|US game show]] ''[[Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?

On 2 May 2007, 25 July 2007, and 29 October 2008, McManus appeared as a guest on NBC's ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'' and as a result now has a regular spot on the show.&lt;ref name="Turning 40" /&gt; In 2011 he hosted a segment called "Rove Across America" on ''The Tonight Show''. Jay Leno and Ed McMahon also made a small pre-recorded appearance at the beginning of McManus' shows in Los Angeles giving him tips for the night's show.

On 23 December 2008, McManus made his debut as host on American television as the host of an [[American Broadcasting Company]] special ''The List''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2008/12/rove-to-host-american-special.html "Rove to host American special"], ''TV Tonight'', 17 December 2008. Retrieved 6 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the 2009 series finale of ''Rove'' shown on 15 November, following several weeks of rumours that the show was going to end, McManus confirmed live on the show that it would be ending with the 2009 finale. He said: "It's purely my decision. It's not one I've made lightly or flippantly. The timing was right to stop, stand back and see what happens next."

In May 2011, McManus relocated to Los Angeles, California, and landed a hosting role on a new talk show, ''[[Rove LA]]''. The show debuted on 19 September 2011, on [[FOX8]], with catch-up airings on [[The Comedy Channel]]. The show was subsequently picked up for a two-year run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://if.com.au/2011/08/31/article/Rove-LA-premieres-Monday-September-19th--on-Fox8/IIXYHTALFH.html|title=Rove LA premieres Monday September&amp;nbsp;19th on Fox8|work=if.com.au|date=31 August 2011|accessdate=29 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, McManus featured as a subject in the Australian version of the series ''[[Who Do You Think You Are? (Australian TV series)|Who Do You Think You Are?]]''.

McManus has also appeared as a 'Round table' guest on the [[E! Network]] late night talk show ''[[Chelsea Lately]]''. He has also made intermittent appearances on [[TV3 (New Zealand)|TV3]]'s satirical ''[[Pulp Sport]]'' series, usually performing menial tasks for the hosts, "Bill and Ben".

On 1 May 2014, McManus appeared on the American comedy show ''[[@midnight]]'' presented by [[Chris Hardwick]] on [[Comedy Central]]. He emerged as the winner being declared by Hardwick as having won the Internet and being the funniest person in the world for the next 23 and a half hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|user=Rove|author=Rove McManus|number=461974864669073408|date=1 May 2014|title=The adorable cat videos are on me, friends RT “@kimberleycooper: You won the internet @Rove!!!!
