'''Nancy Jean Cartwright''' (born October 25, 1957)&lt;ref name=Interview&gt;{{cite web|title=Archive of American Television&amp;nbsp;– Nancy Cartwright Inverview|url=http://emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/nancy-cartwright#|website=emmytvlegends.org|access-date=April 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an American actress, voice actress and comedian, known for her long-running role as [[Bart Simpson]] on the animated television series ''[[The Simpsons]]''. Cartwright also voices other characters for the show, including [[Nelson Muntz]], [[Ralph Wiggum]], [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Todd Flanders|Todd Flanders]], [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Kearney Zzyzwicz|Kearney]] and [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Database|Database]].

Cartwright was born in [[Dayton, Ohio]]. Cartwright moved to Hollywood in 1978 and trained alongside voice actor [[Daws Butler]]. Her first professional role was voicing Gloria in the animated series ''[[Richie Rich (1980 TV series)|Richie Rich]]'', which she followed with a starring role in the television movie ''[[Marian Rose White]]'' (1982) and her first feature film, ''[[Twilight Zone: The Movie]]'' (1983).

After continuing to search for acting work, in 1987, Cartwright auditioned for a role in [[The Simpsons shorts|a series of animated shorts]] about a [[dysfunctional family]] that was to appear on ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]''. Cartwright intended to audition for the role of [[Lisa Simpson]], the middle child; when she arrived at the audition, she found the role of Bart—Lisa's brother—to be more interesting. [[Matt Groening]], the series' creator, allowed her to audition for Bart and offered her the role on the spot. She voiced Bart for three seasons on ''The Tracey Ullman Show'', and in 1989, the shorts were spun off into a half-hour show called ''The Simpsons''. For her subsequent work as Bart, Cartwright received a [[Primetime Emmy Award]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance|Outstanding Voice-Over Performance]] in 1992 and an [[Annie Award]] for Best Voice Acting in the Field of Animation in 1995.

Besides ''The Simpsons'', Cartwright has also voiced numerous other animated characters, including Daffney Gillfin in ''[[The Snorks]]'', [[List of Kim Possible characters#Rufus|Rufus]] in ''[[Kim Possible]]'', [[Buttons and Mindy|Mindy]] in ''[[Animaniacs]]'', Pistol in ''[[Goof Troop]]'', Margo Sherman in ''[[The Critic]]'', Todd Daring in ''[[The Replacements (TV series)|The Replacements]]'', and Charles "Chuckie" Finster, Jr. in ''[[Rugrats]]'' and ''[[All Grown Up!]]'' (a role she assumed in 2002, following the retirement of [[Christine Cavanaugh]]). In 2000, she published her autobiography, ''[[My Life as a 10-Year-Old Boy]]'', and four years later, adapted it into a [[one-person show|one-woman play]]. In 2017, she wrote and produced the film ''[[In Search of Fellini]]''.

==Early life==
Cartwright was born in Dayton, Ohio,&lt;ref name="Little" /&gt; on October 25, 1957, the fourth of Frank and Miriam Cartwright's six children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nancycartwright.com/html/about/bio.html |title=Biography highlights |publisher=Nancycartwright.com |access-date=February 7, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511223935/http://www.nancycartwright.com/html/about/bio.html |archivedate=May 11, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She grew up in [[Kettering, Ohio]],&lt;ref name=Cincinatti /&gt; and discovered her talent for voices at an early age. While in the [[fourth grade]], she won a school-wide speech competition with her performance of [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s ''[[Just So Stories|How the Camel Got His Hump]]''.&lt;ref name="Eat my shorts"&gt;{{cite news |title=Nancy Cartwright: Eat my shorts |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/features/nancy-cartwright-eat-my-shorts-491916.html |date=May 24, 2005 |work=[[The Independent]] |access-date=February 6, 2009 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cartwright attended [[Fairmont High School (Ohio)|Fairmont West High School]], and participated in the school's theater and marching band. She regularly entered public speaking competitions, placing first in the "Humorous Interpretation" category at the National District Tournament two years running. The judges often suggested to her that she should perform cartoon voices. Cartwright graduated from high school in 1976 and accepted a scholarship from [[Ohio University]].&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright, pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt; She continued to compete in public speaking competitions; during her sophomore year, she placed fifth in the National Speech Tournament's exposition category with her speech "The Art of Animation".&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright, pp. 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, Cartwright landed a part-time job doing voice-overs for commercials on [[WING]] radio in Dayton.&lt;ref name=Cincinatti&gt;{{Cite web |title=Bart Simpson's secrets revealed |url=http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2000/12/18/tem_kiesewetter_bart.html |author=Kieswetter, John |work=[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]] |date=December 18, 2000 |access-date=February 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A representative from [[Warner Bros. Records]] visited WING and later sent Cartwright a list of contacts in the animation industry.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright, pp. 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt; One of these was [[Daws Butler]], known for voicing characters such as [[Huckleberry Hound]], [[Snagglepuss]], [[The Jetsons|Elroy Jetson]], [[Spike and Tyke (characters)|Spike the Bulldog]] and [[Yogi Bear]]. Cartwright called him, and left a message in a Cockney accent on his answering machine.&lt;ref name="Eat my shorts" /&gt; Butler immediately called her back and agreed to be her mentor. He mailed her a script and instructed her to send him a tape recording of herself reading it. Once he received the tape, Butler critiqued it and sent her notes. For the next year they continued in this way, completing a new script every few weeks. Cartwright described Butler as "absolutely amazing, always encouraging, always polite".&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cartwright returned to [[Ohio University]] for her sophomore year, but transferred to the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA) so she could be closer to Hollywood and Butler.&lt;ref name=Cincinatti /&gt; Her mother, Miriam, died late in the summer of 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Just don't call me Bart |work=[[Scotland on Sunday]] |date=November 19, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cartwright nearly changed her relocation plans but, on September 17, 1978, "joylessly" left for [[Westwood, Los Angeles]].&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright, pp. 16–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Early career===
[[File:Daws Butler (1976).jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Daws Butler]] was Cartwright's mentor and helped her become a voice actress.&lt;ref name="Edinburgh" /&gt;]]
While attending UCLA, which did not have a public speaking team,&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Cartwright continued training as a voice actress with Butler. She recalled, "every Sunday I'd take a 20-minute bus ride to his house in [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]] for a one-hour lesson and be there for four hours&amp;nbsp;... They had four sons, they didn't have a daughter and I kind of fitted in as the baby of the family."&lt;ref name="Edinburgh"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://edinburghnews.scotsman.com/thesimpsons/And-speaking-of-the-Simpsons.2554090.jp |title=And speaking of the Simpsons |date=August 12, 2004 |work=[[Edinburgh Evening News]] |access-date=February 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Butler introduced her to many of the voice actors and directors at [[Hanna-Barbera]]. After she met the director [[Gordon Hunt (director)|Gordon Hunt]], he asked her to audition for a recurring role as Gloria in ''[[Richie Rich (1980 TV series)|Richie Rich]]''. She received the part, and later worked with Hunt on several other projects. At the end of 1980, Cartwright signed with a talent agency and landed a lead role in a pilot for a [[sitcom]] called ''In Trouble''. Cartwright described the show as "forgettable, but it jump-started my on-camera career".&lt;ref name=p25&gt;Cartwright, pp. 23–25.&lt;/ref&gt; She graduated from UCLA in 1981 with a degree in theater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=12253984 |title=Cartwright: It's Bearable Being Bart's Likeness |access-date=July 26, 2007 |author=Terry Gross Interview on "Fresh Air" (Interview confirms transfer to UCLA) |date=July 26, 2007 |publisher=[[National Public Radio]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the summer, Cartwright worked with [[Jonathan Winters]] as part of an improvisation troupe at [[Kenyon College]] in [[Gambier, Ohio]].&lt;ref name=p25 /&gt;

Returning to [[Los Angeles]], Cartwright won the lead role in the television movie ''[[Marian Rose White]]''. [[Janet Maslin]], a critic for ''[[The New York Times]]'', described Cartwright as "a chubby, lumbering, slightly [[Strabismus|cross-eyed]] actress whose naturalness adds greatly to the film's impact".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0DE1D81138F93AA25752C0A964948260 |title=TV: 'Marian Rose White' in a mental institution |author=Maslin, Janet |authorlink=Janet Maslin |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=January 19, 1982 |access-date=February 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cartwright replied by sending Maslin a letter insisting she was not cross-eyed, and included a photograph.&lt;ref name="bartisagoodgirl"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Bart is a good girl at heart; the mischievous little boy, who brings his iconoclastic status to the big screen, is really a middle aged woman |work=[[Guelph Mercury]] |date=July 26, 2007 |author=New York Times News Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Cartwright auditioned for the role of Ethel, a girl who becomes trapped in a cartoon world in the third segment of ''[[Twilight Zone: The Movie]]''. She met with director [[Joe Dante]] and later described him as "a total cartoon buff, and once he took a look at my resume and noticed Daws Butler's name on it, we were off and running, sharing anecdotes about Daws and animation. After about twenty minutes, he said, 'considering your background, I don't see how I could cast anyone ''but'' you in this part!{{' "}}&lt;ref name="p27" /&gt; It was her first role in a feature film.&lt;ref name="p27"&gt;Cartwright, pp. 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt; The segment was based on ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'' television series episode "[[It's a Good Life (The Twilight Zone)|It's a Good Life]]", which was later parodied in ''The Simpsons'' episode "[[Treehouse of Horror II]]" (1992).&lt;ref&gt;Groening, Matt; [[Al Jean|Jean, Al]]; [[Mike Reiss|Reiss, Mike]]; [[Dan Castellaneta|Castellaneta, Dan]]; [[Jeff Martin (writer)|Martin, Jeff]]; [[Jim Reardon|Reardon, Jim]]. (2003). Commentary for "[[Treehouse of Horror II]]", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Third Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cartwright continued to do voice work for projects including ''[[Pound Puppies]]'', ''[[Popeye and Son]]'', ''[[Snorks]]'', ''[[My Little Pony (TV series)|My Little Pony]]'' and ''[[Saturday Supercade]]''.&lt;ref name=p28&gt;Cartwright, pp. 27–28.&lt;/ref&gt; She joined a "[[Dubbing (filmmaking)|loop group]]", and recorded vocals for characters in the background of films, although in most cases the sound was turned down so that very little of her voice was heard. She did minor voice-over work for several films, including ''[[The Clan of the Cave Bear (film)|The Clan of the Cave Bear]]'' (1986), ''[[Silverado (film)|Silverado]]'' (1985), ''[[Sixteen Candles]]'' (1984), ''[[Back to the Future Part II]]'' (1989), and ''[[The Color Purple (1985 film)|The Color Purple]]'' (1985).&lt;ref name=p29&gt;Cartwright, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Cartwright also voiced a shoe that was "dipped" in acid in ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' (1988), describing it as her first "off-screen death scene",&lt;ref name=p29 /&gt; and worked to correctly convey the emotion involved.&lt;ref name="My Boy" /&gt;

In 1985, she auditioned for a guest spot as Cynthia in ''[[Cheers]]''. The audition called for her to say her line and walk off the set. Cartwright decided to take a chance on being different and continued walking, leaving the building and returning home. The production crew was confused, but she received the part.&lt;ref name=p29 /&gt; In search of more training as an actress, Cartwright joined a class taught by Hollywood coach [[Milton Katselas]]. He recommended that Cartwright study ''[[La Strada]]'', a 1956 Italian film starring [[Giulietta Masina]] and directed by [[Federico Fellini]]. She began performing "every imaginable scene" from ''La Strada'' in her class and spent several months trying to secure the rights to produce a stage adaptation.&lt;ref name="p30" /&gt; She visited Italy with the intention of meeting Fellini and requesting his permission in person. Although they never met, Cartwright kept a journal of the trip and later wrote a one-woman play called ''In Search of Fellini'', partially based on her voyage.&lt;ref name="p30"&gt;Cartwright, pp. 30–33.&lt;/ref&gt; The play was co-written by Peter Kjenaas, and Cartwright won a [[Drama-Logue Award]] after performing it in Los Angeles in 1995. In a 1998 interview, she stated her intention to make it into a feature film,&lt;ref name="Logue"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Voicing her ambitions&amp;nbsp;— The Kettering native stretches her wings&amp;nbsp;— from the sounds of Bart Simpson to producing films |work=[[Dayton Daily News]] |author=Hopkins, Tom |date=April 27, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; which she succeeded in doing in 2017.&lt;ref name="nyt-fellini"/&gt;

Cartwright is best known for her role as [[Bart Simpson]] on the long-running animated television show ''[[The Simpsons]]''. On March 13, 1987, she auditioned for a series of animated shorts about a dysfunctional family that was to appear on ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]'', a sketch comedy program. Cartwright originally intended to audition for the role of [[Lisa Simpson]], the elder daughter. After arriving at the audition, she found that Lisa was simply described as the middle child and at the time did not have much personality. Cartwright became more interested in the role of Bart, described as "devious, underachieving, school-hating, irreverent, [and] clever".&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright, pp. 35–40&lt;/ref&gt; Creator [[Matt Groening]] let her try out for Bart and gave her the job on the spot.&lt;ref name="BBC News"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1017238.stm |title=Bart's voice tells all |access-date=February 5, 2009 |date=November 10, 2000 |publisher=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bart's voice came naturally to Cartwright, as she had previously used elements of it in ''My Little Pony'', ''Snorks'', and ''Pound Puppies''.&lt;ref name="My Boy" /&gt; Cartwright describes Bart's voice as easy to perform compared with other characters.&lt;ref name="My Boy" /&gt; The recording of the shorts was often primitive; the dialog was recorded on a portable tape deck in a makeshift studio above the bleachers on the set of ''The Tracey Ullman Show''. Cartwright, the only cast member to have been professionally trained in voice acting,{{sfn|Turner|2004|p=21}} described the sessions as "great fun".&lt;ref name="P43" /&gt; However, she wanted to appear in the live-action sketches and occasionally showed up for recording sessions early, hoping to be noticed by a producer.&lt;ref name="P43"&gt;Cartwright, pp. 43–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, the shorts were spun off into a half-hour show on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] called ''The Simpsons''. Bart quickly became the show's [[List of breakout characters|breakout personality]] and one of the most celebrated characters on television—his popularity in 1990 and 1991 was known as "Bartmania".{{sfn|Turner|2004|pp=120–121}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cartoon leads a revolt against apple-pie family&amp;nbsp;— Simpsons |date=July 8, 1990 |author=Cassidy, John |work=[[The Sunday Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,22062437-5009160,00.html |title=Simpsons set for big screen |access-date=February 7, 2009 |date=July 15, 2007 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE0D71F3AF93AA15757C0A966958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=4 |title=Cashing in on a Hot New Brand Name |author=Kleinfield, N.R. |access-date=February 7, 2009 |date=April 29, 1990 |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bart was described as "television's brightest new star" by Mike Boone of ''[[The Gazette (Montreal)|The Gazette]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bart Simpson was ray of hope in a year of generally drab television |date=December 30, 1990 |author=Boone, Mike |work=[[The Gazette (Montreal)|The Gazette]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was named 1990's "entertainer of the year" by ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,318928,00.html |title=1.

During the first season of ''The Simpsons'', Fox ordered Cartwright not to give interviews, because they did not want to publicize the fact that Bart was voiced by a woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bart Simpson's secret: he's a woman |author=Bark, Ed |date=July 15, 1990 |work=[[Ottawa Citizen]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cartwright's normal speaking voice is said to have "no obvious traces of Bart",&lt;ref name="My Boy"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/aug/02/broadcasting.edinburgh04 |title=That's my boy |author=Brockes, Emma |access-date=February 5, 2009 |date=August 2, 2004 |work=[[The Guardian]] |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and she believes her role is "the best acting job in the world"&lt;ref name="My Boy" /&gt; since she is rarely recognized in public.&lt;ref name="Eat my shorts" /&gt; When she is recognized and asked to perform Bart's voice in front of children, Cartwright refuses because it "freaks [them] out".&lt;ref name="My Boy" /&gt; Bart's catchphrase "Eat My Shorts" was an ad-lib by Cartwright in one of the original table readings, referring to an incident from her high school days. Once while performing, members of the Fairmont West High School marching band switched their chant from the usual "Fairmont West! Fairmont West!" to the irreverent "Eat my shorts!" Cartwright felt it appropriate for Bart, and improvised the line; it became a popular catchphrase on the show.&lt;ref name=Trivia&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1565538/20070725/story.jhtml |title='Simpsons' Trivia, From Swearing Lisa To 'Burns-Sexual' Smithers |access-date=July 29, 2007 |date=July 26, 2007 |author=Carroll, Larry |publisher=[[MTV]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071220140402/http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1565538/20070725/story.jhtml |archivedate=December 20, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Further career===
{{Quote box |width=30em |bgcolor=transparent |align=right |quote=It is quite a curiosity being a celebrity that nobody knows. I ask you, how many celebrities would you ''not'' recognize were they to walk down the street? [...] I can think of no one—besides my fellow cast members and me.

I must admit, sometimes I wish it were different. |salign=right |source=—Nancy Cartwright, ''My Life as a 10-Year-Old Boy''&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright, pp. 248–249.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In addition to her work on ''The Simpsons'', Cartwright has voiced many other characters on several animated series, including Chuckie Finster in ''[[Rugrats]]'' and ''[[All Grown Up!]]'', Margo Sherman in ''[[The Critic]]'', [[Buttons and Mindy|Mindy]] in ''[[Animaniacs]],'' and [[List of Kim Possible characters#Rufus|Rufus]] the [[naked mole-rat]] in ''[[Kim Possible]]''. For the role of Rufus, Cartwright researched mole-rats extensively, and became "a font of useless trivia".&lt;ref name="Behind"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Voice behind Bart Simpson also lends her animated talents to other TV shows |work=[[The San Diego Union-Tribune]] |author=Knutzen, Eirik |date=August 18, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was nominated for a [[Daytime Emmy Award]] for Outstanding Performer in an Animated Program in 2004 for her work on the show.&lt;ref name="Daffy" /&gt; In 2001, Cartwright took over the ''Rugrats'' role of Chuckie Finster when [[Christine Cavanaugh]] retired.&lt;ref name="Behind" /&gt; Cartwright describes Rufus and Chuckie as her two most difficult voices: "Rufus because my diaphragm gets a workout while trying to utilize the 18 vocal sounds a mole makes. Chuckie because&amp;nbsp;... he's an asthmatic with five personalities rolled into one—plus I have to do the voice the way [Cavanaugh] did it for 10 years."&lt;ref name="Behind" /&gt; Other television shows that have used her voice work include ''[[Galaxy High]],'' ''[[God, the Devil and Bob]],'' ''[[Goof Troop]],'' ''[[Mike, Lu &amp; Og]],'' ''[[The Replacements (TV series)|The Replacements]],'' ''[[Pinky and the Brain]]'' and ''Timberwolf''.&lt;ref name="Flash" /&gt; Cartwright has appeared on camera in numerous television shows and films, including ''[[Fame (1982 TV series)|Fame]]'', ''[[Empty Nest]]'', ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]'', ''[[Flesh and Blood (1985 film)|Flesh and Blood]]'', ''[[Godzilla (1998 film)|Godzilla]],'' and ''[[24 (season 6)|24]]''.&lt;ref name="Flash" /&gt;

In 2000, Cartwright published her autobiography, ''[[My Life as a 10-Year-Old Boy]]''.
