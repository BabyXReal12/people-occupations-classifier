'''Andrew Geoffrey Kaufman''' (January 17, 1949&amp;nbsp;– May 16, 1984)&lt;ref name="TSGDeathCert"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/kaufmandeath1.html|title=Certificate of Death, State of California: Andrew G.

While often called a comedian, Kaufman described himself instead as a "song and dance man".&lt;ref name="bizarre"&gt;{{cite web|date=December 23, 1999|last=Givens|first=Ron|title=Andy Kaufman recalled as bizarre, gifted|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&amp;dat=19991223&amp;id=FYkxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=nKMFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3763,5038742&amp;hl=en|publisher=''[[New York Daily News]]''; ''Reading Eagle''|accessdate=August 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He disdained telling jokes and engaging in comedy as it was traditionally understood, once saying in a rare introspective interview, "I am not a comic, I have never told a joke. ... The comedian's promise is that he will go out there and make you laugh with him... My only promise is that I will try to entertain you as best I can."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/person/37092/Andy-Kaufman/biography|first=Sandra|last=Brennan|title=Full Biography|work=[[The New York Times]]|quote=I am not a comic, I have never told a joke. ...

After working in small comedy clubs in the early 1970s, Kaufman came to the attention of a wider audience in 1975, when he was invited to perform portions of his act on the first season of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. His Foreign Man character was the basis of his performance as [[Latka Gravas]] on the hit television show [[Taxi (TV series)|''Taxi'']] from 1978 until 1983.&lt;ref name="nytimesobituary"&gt;{{cite news|date=May 18, 1984|last=Prial|first=Frank J.|title=ANDY KAUFMAN, A COMEDIAN KNOWN FOR UNORTHODOX SKITS|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/05/18/obituaries/andy-kaufman-a-comedian-known-for-unorthodox-skits.html|website=The New York Times|accessdate=July 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, he continued to tour comedy clubs and theaters in a series of unique performance art / comedy shows, sometimes appearing as himself and sometimes as obnoxiously rude [[lounge singer]] [[Tony Clifton]]. He was also a frequent guest on [[sketch comedy]] and [[late-night talk show]]s, particularly ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]''.&lt;ref name="beloved"/&gt; In 1982, Kaufman brought his [[professional wrestling]] [[Heel (professional wrestling)|villain]] act to Letterman's show by way of a staged encounter with [[Jerry Lawler|Jerry "The King" Lawler]] of the [[Continental Wrestling Association]] (although the fact that the altercation was planned in advance was not publicly disclosed for over a decade).

Kaufman died of lung cancer in 1984, at the age of 35.&lt;ref name="clifton"/&gt; Because pranks and elaborate ruses were major elements of his career, persistent rumors have circulated that Kaufman [[Faked death|faked his own death]] as a grand hoax.&lt;ref name="beloved"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=March 30, 1995|title=Tip-off|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1346&amp;dat=19950330&amp;id=P-RNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=If0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5605,6852532|publisher=''Lakeland Ledger''|accessdate=August 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continues to be respected for the variety of his characters, his uniquely counterintuitive approach to comedy, and his willingness to provoke negative and confused reactions from audiences.&lt;ref name="beloved"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=June 9, 1984|last=Handler|first=David|title=Kaufman Blazed New Trails|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1356&amp;dat=19840609&amp;id=qSgxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=GwYEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2505,4904519|publisher=''Ocala Star-Banner''|accessdate=August 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Kaufman was born on January 17, 1949, in New York City, the oldest of three children. His mother was Janice (née Bernstein), a homemaker and former fashion model, and his father was Stanley Kaufman, a jewelry salesman.&lt;ref name="funhousep6-10"&gt;Zehme. pp.6–10&lt;/ref&gt; Andy, along with his younger brother Michael and sister Carol, grew up in a middle-class [[Jews|Jewish]] family in [[Great Neck, New York|Great Neck]], [[Long Island]].&lt;ref name="funhousep12"&gt;{{cite book |last=Zehme |first=Bill |date=1999 |title=Lost in the Funhouse: The Life and Mind of Andy Kaufman |publisher=Delacorte Press |page=12 |isbn=9780385333719 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He began performing at children's birthday parties at age 9, playing records and showing cartoons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://andykaufman.jvlnet.com/realmotm.htm|title="The Real Man on the Moon Talks" by Kaufman's father|publisher=Andykaufman.jvlnet.com|accessdate=February 10, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111075409/http://andykaufman.jvlnet.com/realmotm.htm|archivedate= January 11, 2010 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kaufman spent much of his youth writing poetry and stories, including an unpublished novel, ''The Hollering Mangoo'', which he completed at age 16.&lt;ref name="funhousepp67-68"&gt;Zehme. pp. 67–68&lt;/ref&gt; Following a visit to his school from Nigerian musician [[Babatunde Olatunji]], Kaufman began playing the [[congas]].&lt;ref name="funhousep38-39"&gt;Zehme. pp. 38–39.&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating from [[John L. Miller Great Neck North High School|Great Neck North High School]] in 1967, Kaufman took a year off before enrolling at the now defunct two-year [[Grahm Junior College]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grahmjuniorcollege.org/alumni.htm |title=Grahm Junior College Alumni|website=Grahmjuniorcollege.org |date=2017-01-03 |accessdate=2017-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Boston,&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;{{cite web|date=December 30, 1979|title=Profile: Andy Kaufman|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1697&amp;dat=19791230&amp;id=fjAqAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=A0cEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6674,6067310|publisher=''Park City Daily News''|accessdate=August 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he studied television production and starred in his own campus television show, ''Uncle Andy's Fun House.''&lt;ref name="nytimesobituary"/&gt;

He began performing at coffee houses and developing his act, as well as writing a one-man play, ''Gosh'' (later renamed ''God'' and published in 2000).&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt; After graduating in 1971, he began performing stand-up comedy at various small clubs on the [[East coast of the United States|East Coast]].&lt;ref name="funhousep132-141"&gt;Zehme. pp.132–141&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cabaret"&gt;{{cite news|date=July 11, 1974|last=Shepard|first=Richard F.|title=Songs and a New Comedian Make Lively Cabaret|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/07/11/archives/songs-and-a-new-comedian-make-lively-cabaret.html|website=The New York Times|accessdate=July 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===Foreign Man and Mighty Mouse===
Kaufman first received major attention for his character Foreign Man, who spoke in a meek, high-pitched, heavy-accented voice and claimed to be from "Caspiar", a fictional island in the [[Caspian Sea]].&lt;ref name="cabaret"/&gt; It was as this character that Kaufman convinced the owner of the famed New York City comedy club [[The Improv]], [[Budd Friedman]], to allow him to perform on stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Improv Comedy Club History|url=http://improv.com/History}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="zoglin"&gt;{{cite book|date=2008|last=Zoglin|first=Richard|title=Comedy at the Edge: How Stand-up in the 1970s Changed America|url=http://www.abebooks.com/9781582346243/Comedy-Edge-Stand-up-1970s-Changed-1582346240/plp|isbn=1582346240|publisher=Bloomsbury USA|accessdate=August 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Foreign Man, Kaufman would appear on the stage of [[comedy club]]s, play a recording of the theme from the ''[[Mighty Mouse]]'' cartoon show while standing perfectly still, and [[lip sync|lip-sync]] only the line "Here I come to save the day" with great enthusiasm.&lt;ref name="cnn2012"/&gt; He would proceed to tell a few (purposely poor) jokes and conclude his act with a series of celebrity [[impersonator|impersonations]], with the comedy arising from the character's obvious ineptitude at impersonation. For example, in his fake accent Kaufman would say to the audience, "I would like to imitate [[Jimmy Carter|Meester Carter]], de president of de United States" and then, in exactly the same voice, say "Hello, I am Meester Carter, de president of de United States. T'ank you veddy much."
At some point in the performance, usually when the audience was conditioned to Foreign Man's inability to perform a single convincing impression, Foreign Man would announce, "And now I would like to imitate the [[Elvis Presley]]", turn around, take off his jacket, slick his hair back, and launch into a rousing, hip-shaking, excellent rendition of Presley singing one of his hit songs. Like Presley, he would take off his leather jacket during the song and throw it into the audience, but unlike Presley, Foreign Man would immediately ask for it to be returned. After the song's finale, he would take a simple bow and say in his Foreign Man voice, "T'ank you veddy much."{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Portions of Kaufman's Foreign Man act were broadcast in the first season of ''Saturday Night Live''. The Mighty Mouse number was featured in the October 11, 1975, premiere, while the joke-telling and celebrity impressions (including Elvis) were included in the November 8 broadcast that same year.&lt;ref name="snl-s1"&gt;''SNL: The Complete First Season, 1975–1976''. DVD recording.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latka===
{{Main|Latka Gravas}}
[[File:Akaufman1.jpg|thumb|210px|right|Kaufman's well-known Foreign Man persona was later adapted as the character Latka Gravas on ABC sitcom ''Taxi''. Though Kaufman's performances on ''Taxi'' were widely praised, even receiving two Golden Globe nominations, he was unhappy about being so closely identified with Latka.]]

Kaufman first used his Foreign Man character in nightclubs in the early 1970s, often to tell jokes incorrectly and do weak imitations of famous people before bursting into his Elvis Presley imitation. The character was then changed into Latka Gravas for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s sitcom ''[[Taxi (TV series)|Taxi]]'', appearing in 79 of 114 episodes in 1978-83.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} [[Bob Zmuda]] confirms this: "They basically were buying Andy's Foreign Man character for the ''Taxi'' character Latka."&lt;ref name="oral"&gt;[http://www.bluedonut.com/ak.htm "Andy Kaufman Oral History"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206215413/http://www.bluedonut.com/ak.htm |date=December 6, 2006 }}, interviews with Don Steinberg, originally published in short form in ''GQ Magazine'', December 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Kaufman's longtime manager [[George Shapiro]] encouraged him to take the gig.

Kaufman disliked sitcoms and was not happy with the idea of being in one, but Shapiro convinced him that it would quickly lead to stardom, which would earn him money he could then put into his own act. Kaufman agreed to appear in 14 episodes per season, and initially wanted four for Kaufman's alter ego [[Tony Clifton]]. After Kaufman deliberately sabotaged Clifton's appearance on the show, however, that part of his contract was dropped.&lt;ref name="clifton"&gt;{{cite web|date=May 23, 1984|last=Shales|first=Tom|title=Kaufman's many faces made him one of a kind|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&amp;dat=19840523&amp;id=gWoaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=QioEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7154,1748529&amp;hl=en|publisher=''[[The Milwaukee Journal]]''|accessdate=July 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His character was given [[multiple personality disorder]], which allowed Kaufman to randomly portray other characters. In one episode of ''Taxi'', Kaufman's character came down with a condition that made him act like Alex Reiger, the main character played by [[Judd Hirsch]]. Another such recurring character played by Kaufman was the womanizing Vic Ferrari.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0718495 ''Taxi'' (Season 3, Episode 20, "Latka the Playboy"], imdb.com; accessed January 28, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sam Simon]], who early in his career was a writer and later [[showrunner]] for ''Taxi'', stated in a 2013 interview on Marc Maron's [[WTF with Marc Maron|''WTF'' podcast]] that the story of Kaufman having been generally disruptive on the show was "a complete fiction" largely created by Zmuda. Simon maintained that Zmuda has a vested interest in promoting an out-of-control image of Kaufman. In the interview Simon stated that Kaufman was "completely professional" and that he "told you Tony Clifton was him", but he also conceded that Kaufman would have "loved" Zmuda's version of events.&lt;ref&gt;[[Maron, Marc]] (May 16, 2013). [http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episodes/episode_389_-_sam_simon "Episode 389&amp;nbsp;– Sam Simon"], WTFPod.com; accessed January 28, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kaufman was nominated for the [[Golden Globe Award]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor&amp;nbsp;– Series, Miniseries or Television Film|Best Supporting Actor in a Series, Limited Series, or Motion Picture Made For Television]] for ''Taxi'' in 1979 and 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Golden Globe Awards: Winners &amp; Nominees|url=http://www.goldenglobes.com/person/andy-kaufman|publisher=GoldenGlobes.com|accessdate=October 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tony Clifton===
{{refimprove section|date=January 2017}}
{{Main|Tony Clifton}}
Another well-known Kaufman character is Tony Clifton, an absurd, audience-abusing [[lounge singer]] who began opening for Kaufman at comedy clubs and eventually even performed concerts on his own around the country. Sometimes it was Kaufman performing as Clifton, sometimes it was his brother Michael or Zmuda. For a brief time, it was unclear to some that Clifton was not a real person. News programs interviewed Clifton as Kaufman's opening act, with the mood turning ugly whenever Kaufman's name came up. Kaufman, Clifton insisted, was attempting to ruin Clifton's "good name" in order to make money and become famous.

As a requirement for Kaufman's accepting the offer to star on ''Taxi'', he insisted that Clifton be hired for a guest role on the show as if he were a real person, not a character.&lt;ref name="clifton"/&gt; After throwing a tantrum on the set, Clifton was fired and escorted from the studio lot by security guards. Much to Kaufman's delight, this incident was reported in the local newspapers.&lt;ref name="standup"&gt;{{cite book|date=2009|last=Knoedelseder|first=William|title=I'm Dying Up Here: Heartbreak and High Times in Stand-up Comedy's Golden Era|isbn=9781586483173|publisher=''PublicAffairs''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Carnegie Hall show===
At the beginning of an April 1979 performance at New York's [[Carnegie Hall]], Kaufman invited his "grandmother" to watch the show from a chair he had placed at the side of the stage. At the end of the show, she stood up, took her mask off and revealed to the audience that she was actually comedian [[Robin Williams]] in disguise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=April 28, 1979|last=Maslin|first=Janet|title=Comedy: Andy Kaufman Fills Stage With Parade of Odd Characters|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/04/28/archives/comedy-andy-kaufman-fills-stage-with-parade-of-odd-characters.html|website=The New York Times|accessdate=July 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kaufman also had an elderly woman (Eleanor Cody Gould) pretend to have a heart attack and die on stage, at which point he reappeared on stage wearing a Native American [[headdress]] and performed a dance over her body, "reviving" her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shackett|first=Barbara|date=2013|title=Stranded in Montana; Dumped in Arizona|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jnL3GnL3HfQC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;lpg=PA81&amp;dq=eleanor+cody+gould+andy+kaufman#v=onepage&amp;q=eleanor%20cody%20gould%20andy%20kaufman&amp;f=false|publisher=''Dorrance Publishing''|isbn=9781434928559|accessdate=July 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="washingtonpost1979"&gt;{{cite web|date=July 1, 1979|last=Carter|first=Betsy|title=Hide-'n'-seek in Andy Kaufman's fun house|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/hide-n-seek-in-andy-kaufmans-fun-house/2014/10/06/e2e03928-4d93-11e4-8c24-487e92bc997b_story.html|website=The Washington Post|accessdate=July 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The performance is most famous for Kaufman's ending the show by actually taking the entire audience, in 24 buses, out for milk and cookies. He invited anyone interested to meet him on the [[Staten Island Ferry]] the next morning, where the show continued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=April 28, 1979|title=Comic Encore: Milk, Cookies For Audience|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2194&amp;dat=19790427&amp;id=Vr4yAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=IO4FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7011,1562422&amp;hl=en|publisher=''The Ottawa Citizen''|accessdate=July 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===TV specials===
The ''Taxi'' deal with [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] included giving Kaufman a television special/pilot. He came up with ''Andy's Funhouse'', based on an old routine he had developed while in junior college. The special was taped in 1977 but did not air until August 1979. It featured most of Andy's famous gags, including Foreign Man/Latka and his Elvis Presley impersonation, as well as a host of unique segments (including a special appearance by children's television character [[Howdy Doody]] and the "Has-been Corner").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=August 28, 1979|last=Maslin|first=Janet|title=TV: A 90‐Minute Special With Andy Kaufman|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/08/28/archives/tv-a-90minute-special-with-andy-kaufman.html|website=The New York Times|accessdate=July 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also a segment that included fake television screen static as part of the gag, which ABC executives were not comfortable with, fearing that viewers would mistake the static for broadcast problems and would change the channel—which was the comic element Kaufman wanted to present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=August 3, 1989|last=Wickstrom|first=Andy|title=Andy Kaufman Still Surprises in a 1977 Video|url=http://articles.philly.com/1989-08-03/entertainment/26147012_1_latka-gravas-andy-kaufman-foreigner|website=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]|accessdate=July 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Andy's Funhouse'' was written by Kaufman, Zmuda, and Mel Sherer, with music by Kaufman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=July 22, 2013|last=Elisberg|first=Robert J.|title=Pal Mel|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-j-elisberg/pal-mel_b_3319754.html|website=[[The Huffington Post]]|accessdate=July 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1980, Kaufman filmed a short segment for an ABC show called ''Buckshot.'' The segment was just over six minutes long and was called ''Uncle Andy's Funhouse''. It featured Kaufman as the host of a children's show for adults, complete with a [[peanut gallery]] and Tony Clifton puppet.&lt;ref name="uncleandy"&gt;{{cite web|date=July 18, 1980|last=Arnott|first=Susan L.|title=The Television Picture: What's Special...|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&amp;dat=19800718&amp;id=JiEqAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=rysEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6782,4112414&amp;hl=en|publisher=''The Milwaukee Journal''|accessdate=July 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, a show very similar to ''Andy's Funhouse'' and ''Uncle Andy's Funhouse'' was filmed for [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]'s [[Soundstage (TV series)|SoundStage]] program, called ''The Andy Kaufman Show''. It too featured a peanut gallery, and [[cold open|opened in the middle]] of an interview Kaufman is doing in which he is laughing hysterically. He then proceeds to thank the audience for watching and the credits roll.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===''Fridays'' incidents===
In 1981 Kaufman made three appearances on ''[[Fridays (ABC TV series)|Fridays]]'', a variety show on ABC that was similar to ''Saturday Night Live''. In his first appearance, during a sketch about four people out on a dinner date who excuse themselves to the restroom to smoke [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]], Kaufman broke character and refused to say his lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=February 24, 1981|last=Schwartz|first=Tony|title=Was 'Fight' on TV Real or Staged?

In response, cast member [[Michael Richards]] walked off camera and returned with a set of cue cards and dumped them on the table in front of Kaufman who responded by splashing Richards with water. Co-producer [[Jack Burns]] stormed onto the stage, leading to a brawl on camera before the show abruptly cut away to a commercial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|url=http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/544255131b|title=Andy Kaufman on Fridays from FridaysFan|publisher=Funnyordie.com|date=February 11, 2008|accessdate=February 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richards has claimed that this incident was a staged practical joke that was known only to him, associate producer Burns, and Kaufman,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/michael-richards-2 "Michael Richards 'Speaking Freely' transcript"]; recorded February 28, 2002 in Aspen, Colorado.

Kaufman appeared the following week in a videotaped apology to the home viewers. Later that year, Kaufman returned to host ''Fridays''. At one point in the show, he invited a ''[[Lawrence Welk Show]]'' gospel and standards singer, [[Kathie Sullivan]], on stage to sing a few gospel songs with him and announced that the two were engaged to be married, then talked to the audience about his newfound faith in Jesus (Kaufman was Jewish). That was also a hoax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-60822022.html|title=Kaufman Was My Hoax Fiance; The Taxi star pulled some of the funniest stunts on US TV, but his fake engagement fooled the world|last=Burton|first=Alex|date=February 25, 2000|work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]|accessdate= January 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, following a sketch about a drug-abusing pharmacist, Kaufman was supposed to introduce the band [[The Pretenders]]. Instead of introducing the band, he delivered a nervous speech about the harmfulness of drugs while the band stood behind him ready to play. After his speech, he informed the audience that he had talked for too long and had to go to a commercial.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Professional wrestling===
Inspired by the theatricality of ''[[kayfabe]]'', the staged nature of the sport, and his own tendency to form elaborate hoaxes, Kaufman began [[Intergender wrestling|wrestling women]] during his act and proclaimed himself "Inter-Gender Wrestling Champion of the World", taking on an aggressive and ridiculous personality based on the characters invented by professional wrestlers. He offered a $1,000 prize to any woman who could pin him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=December 21, 1979|last=Rosenberg|first=Howard|title=Corpus Christi Cosmetician Among Competitors: Woman-Wrestling Comic May Meet Match|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=861&amp;dat=19791221&amp;id=bsJRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=SmkDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6937,5869625&amp;hl=en|publisher=''The Victoria Advocate''|accessdate=August 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=December 26, 1979|title=Ms. Peckham eyes rematch with Kaufman|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2457&amp;dat=19791226&amp;id=HRBbAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=cU4NAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3846,4000677&amp;hl=en|publisher=''Bangor Daily News''|accessdate=August 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He employed performance artist [[Laurie Anderson]], a friend of his, in this act for a while.&lt;ref&gt;Laurie Anderson, ''Stories from the Nerve Bible'' (Perennial 1993)&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN, page(s) needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Kaufman initially approached the head of the [[World Wrestling Federation]], [[Vince McMahon Sr.]], about bringing his act to the New York wrestling territory.&lt;ref name="apter"&gt;{{cite web|date=October 21, 2015|last=Johnson|first=Vaughn|title=Bill Apter recounts legendary career in new book|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/the-squared-circle/Bill-Apter-recounts-legendary-career-in-new-book.html|website=The Philadelphia Inquirer|accessdate=July 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; McMahon dismissed Kaufman's idea as the elder McMahon was not about to bring "show business" into his Pro Wrestling society.&lt;ref name="apter"/&gt; Kaufman had by then developed a friendship with wrestling reporter/photographer Bill Apter.&lt;ref name="apter"/&gt; After many discussions about Kaufman's desire to be in the pro wrestling business, Apter called Memphis wrestling icon [[Jerry Lawler|Jerry "The King" Lawler]] and introduced him to Kaufman by telephone.&lt;ref name="apter"/&gt;

Kaufman finally stepped into the ring (in the [[Continental Wrestling Association|Memphis wrestling circuit]]) with a man—Lawler himself.&lt;ref name="cnn2012"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/04/07/us/kaufman-lawler-wrestling-match/|title=The Great Ruse: The comedic genius who rocked wrestling|first=Wayne|last=Drash|publisher=CNN|date=April 7, 2012|accessdate=April 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kaufman taunted the residents of Memphis by playing "videos showing residents how to use soap" and proclaiming the city to be "the nation's [[redneck]] capital".&lt;ref name="cnn2012"/&gt; The ongoing Lawler-Kaufman [[feud (professional wrestling)|feud]], which often featured [[Jimmy Hart]] and other [[heel (professional wrestling)|heels]] in Kaufman's corner, included a number of staged "[[List of professional wrestling terms#W|works]]", such as a broken neck for Kaufman as a result of Lawler's [[piledriver (professional wrestling)|piledriver]] and a famous on-air fight on a 1982 episode of ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmHCx8lCl8Y|title=kaufman-lawler|publisher=[[YouTube]]|date=2012-03-24|accessdate=2017-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=July 30, 1982|title=Andy Kaufman in New Fray with Wrestler on TV Show|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/30/arts/andy-kaufman-in-new-fray-with-wrestler-on-tv-show.html|website=The New York Times|accessdate=July 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For some time after that first match, Kaufman appeared wearing a neck brace,&lt;ref name="cnn2012"/&gt; insisting that his injuries were much worse than they really were. Kaufman would continue to defend the Inter-Gender Championship in the [[Mid-South Coliseum]] and offered an extra prize, other than the $1,000: that if he were pinned, the woman who pinned him would get to marry him and that Kaufman would also shave his head.&lt;ref name="klfeud2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p5KMZe8n0o|title=The Kaufman Lawler Feud: Chapter 2&amp;nbsp;– The Fourth One|date=January 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually it was revealed that the feud and wrestling matches were staged works,&lt;ref&gt;Collins, Scott (November 15, 2013). [http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/showtracker/la-et-st-jerry-lawler-why-his-andy-kaufman-wrestling-match-resonated-20131115-story.html "Jerry Lawler: Why his Andy Kaufman wrestling match still resonates"]. ''Los Angeles Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; and that Kaufman and Lawler were friends. This was not disclosed until more than 10 years after Kaufman's death, when the Emmy-nominated documentary ''A Comedy Salute to Andy Kaufman'' aired on [[NBC]] in 1995. [[Jim Carrey]], who revealed the secret, later went on to play Kaufman in the [[1999 in film|1999 film]] ''[[Man on the Moon (film)|Man on the Moon]].'' In a 1997 interview with the ''Memphis Flyer'', Lawler said he had improvised during their first match and the ''Letterman'' incident.

Although officials at St. Francis Hospital stated that Kaufman's neck injuries were real, in his 2002 biography ''It's Good to Be the King ... Sometimes'', Lawler detailed how they came up with the [[List of professional wrestling terms#A|angle]] and kept it quiet. Even though Kaufman's injury was legitimate, the pair exaggerated it. He also said that Kaufman's furious tirade and performance on ''Letterman'' was Kaufman's own idea, including when Lawler slapped Kaufman out of his chair. Promoter [[Jerry Jarrett]] later recalled that for two years, he would mail Kaufman payments comparable to what other main-event wrestlers were getting at the time, but Kaufman never deposited the checks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.f4wonline.com/component/content/article/27559-sept-24-2012-observer-newsletter-huge-story-on-history-of-jerry-lawler-in-memphis-biggest-matches-and-angles-plus-all-the-news-from-the-past-week-night-of-champions-and-more "(Title unknown)"], Wrestling Observer Figure Four Online; accessed January 28, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kaufman appeared in the 1983 film ''[[My Breakfast with Blassie]]'' with professional wrestling personality [[Freddie Blassie|"Classy" Freddie Blassie]]. The film was a parody of the art film ''[[My Dinner with Andre]].'' Lynne Margulies, sister of the film's director, [[Johnny Legend]], appears in it, and became romantically involved with Kaufman.

In 2002, Kaufman became a playable character in the video game ''[[Legends of Wrestling II]]'' and a standard character in 2004's ''[[Showdown: Legends of Wrestling]]''. In 2008, [[Jakks Pacific]] produced for their WWE Classic Superstars toy line an action figure two-pack of Kaufman and Lawler, as well as a separate figures release for each of them.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Appearances===
Although Kaufman made a name for himself as a guest on [[NBC]]'s ''Saturday Night Live'', his first prime-time appearances were several guest spots as the "Foreign Man" on the [[Dick Van Dyke]] variety show ''Van Dyke and Company'' in 1976.&lt;ref name="vandyke"&gt;{{cite web|date=September 20, 1976|last=Sharbutt|first=Jay|title=Van Dyke springs hour of lunacy|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2199&amp;dat=19760920&amp;id=4rYrAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=A-YFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6644,3134911|publisher=''Lawrence Journal-World''|accessdate=August 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He appeared four times on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson|The Tonight Show]]'' in 1976–78, and three times on ''[[The Midnight Special (TV series)|The Midnight Special]]'' in 1972, 1977, and 1981.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Kaufman appeared on ''[[The Dating Game]]'' in 1978, in character as Foreign Man, and cried when the bachelorette chose Bachelor #1, protesting that he had answered all the questions correctly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Andy Kaufman en The Dating Game (1978) (Subtitulado)|date=2016-04-08|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUUZNGbpc84|accessdate=2017-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His ''SNL'' appearances started with the [[Saturday Night Live (season 1)|first show, on October 11, 1975]]. He made 16 ''SNL'' appearances in all, doing routines from his comedy act, such as the Mighty Mouse singalong, Foreign Man, and the Elvis impersonation. After he angered the audience with his female-wrestling routine, Kaufman in January 1983 made a pretaped appearance (his 16th) asking the audience if he should ever appear on the show again, saying he would honor their decision. ''[[Saturday Night Live|SNL]]'' ran a phone vote, and 195,544 people voted to "Dump Andy" while 169,186 people voted to "Keep Andy".&lt;ref name="passion_tally"&gt;{{cite video|people=Alan Graham (producer)|date=February 21, 2008|title=The Passion of Andy Kaufman|url=http://www.stickam.com/subcin|format=[[SWF]]|medium=Archive footage|publisher=Subterranean Cinema|accessdate=March 20, 2008|time=2:20:00|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005174736/http://www.stickam.com/subcin|archivedate=October 5, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the ''SNL'' episode with the phone poll, many of the cast members stated their admiration for Kaufman's work. After [[Eddie Murphy]] read both numbers, he said, "Now, Andy Kaufman is a friend of mine. Keep that in mind when you call. I don't want to have to punch nobody in America in the face", and [[Mary Gross]] read the Dump Andy phone number at a rate so fast that audiences were unable to catch it. The final tally was read by [[Gary Kroeger]] to a cheering audience. As the credits rolled, announcer [[Don Pardo]] said, "This is Don Pardo saying, 'I voted for Andy Kaufman.'"&lt;ref name="passion"&gt;{{cite video|people=Alan Graham (producer)|date=February 21, 2008|title=The Passion of Andy Kaufman|url=http://www.stickam.com/subcin|format=[[SWF]]|medium=Archive footage|publisher=Subterranean Cinema|accessdate=March 20, 2008|time=2:10:55–2:20:33|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005174736/http://www.stickam.com/subcin|archivedate=October 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kaufman made a number of appearances on the daytime edition of ''[[The David Letterman Show]]'' in 1980, and 11 appearances on ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'' in 1982-83.

[[Laurie Anderson]] worked alongside Kaufman for a time in the 1970s, acting as a sort of "straight man" in a number of his [[Manhattan]] and [[Coney Island]] performances. One of these performances included getting on a ride that people stand in and get spun around. After everyone was strapped in, Kaufman would start saying how he did not want to be on the ride in a panicked tone and eventually cry. Anderson later described these performances in her 1995 album, ''[[The Ugly One with the Jewels]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=January 2012|last=Stern|first=Amanda|title=Laurie Anderson|url=http://www.believermag.com/issues/201201/?read=interview_anderson|publisher=''The Believer''|accessdate=July 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kaufman never married.

==Illness and death==
{{refimprove section|date=January 2017}}
At [[Thanksgiving]] dinner on [[Long Island]] in November 1983, several family members openly expressed worry about Kaufman's persistent [[coughing]]. He claimed that he had been coughing for nearly a month, visited his doctor, and been told that nothing was wrong. When he returned to Los Angeles, he consulted another physician, then checked himself into [[Cedars-Sinai Medical Center]] for a series of medical tests. A few days later, he was diagnosed with [[Large-cell lung carcinoma|large-cell carcinoma]], an extremely rare type of lung cancer.

After audiences were shocked by his gaunt appearance during January 1984 performances, Kaufman acknowledged that he had an unspecified illness which he hoped to cure with [[natural medicine]], including a diet of all fruits and vegetables, among other measures. Kaufman received palliative [[radiotherapy]], but by then the cancer had spread from his lungs to his brain. His final public appearance was at the premiere of ''My Breakfast With Blassie'' in March 1984, where he appeared thin and had a partially shaved head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=June 4, 1984|last=Wolmuth|first=Roger|title=Andy Kaufman 1949–1984|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20087990,00.html|publisher=''People''|accessdate=October 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, he and Lynne Margulies flew to [[Baguio]], Philippines, where as a last resort, Kaufman received treatments of a pseudoscientific procedure called [[psychic surgery]].

==Death-hoax rumors==
Kaufman often spoke of [[Faked death|faking his own death]] as a grand hoax, with rumors persisting, often fueled by sporadic appearances of Kaufman's character Tony Clifton at comedy clubs after his death.&lt;ref name=CNNdeathhoax&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/11/14/showbiz/andy-kaufman-alive-or-not/index.html|title=Andy Kaufman's brother says he is victim of hoax|first=Wayne|last=Drash|publisher=CNN|date=November 15, 2013|accessdate=June 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Clifton" performed a year after Kaufman's death at [[The Comedy Store]] benefit in Kaufman's honor, with members of his entourage in attendance, and during the 1990s made several appearances at Los Angeles nightclubs. [[Jim Carrey]], who portrayed Kaufman in ''Man on the Moon'', stated on the NBC special ''Comedy Salute to Andy Kaufman'' that the person doing the Clifton character was [[Bob Zmuda]]. Kaufman's official website states that his death was not a hoax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://andykaufman.jvlnet.com/final.htm|title=The Last Days of Andy Kaufman|publisher=Andykaufman.jvlnet.com|accessdate=September 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, responding to rumors following the appearance of an actress who claimed to be Kaufman's daughter and that he was still alive, [[Los Angeles County Coroner]]'s office re-released Kaufman's death certificate to confirm he was indeed deceased and buried at [[Beth David Cemetery]].&lt;ref name="TSGDeathCert"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autopsyfiles.org/reports/deathcert/kaufman,%20andy_dc.pdf|format=PDF|title=Certificate of Death: Andrew G.

In 2014, Zmuda and Lynne Margulies, Kaufman's girlfriend at the time of his death, coauthored ''Andy Kaufman: The Truth, Finally'', a book claiming that Kaufman's death was indeed a prank, and that he would soon be revealing himself, as his upper limit on the "prank" was 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2014/09/28/why-andy-kaufman-might-still-be-alive|title=Friend: Andy Kaufman is still alive|accessdate=October 5, 2014|author=Getlen, Larry|work=New York Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comedian [[Richard Lewis (comedian)|Richard Lewis]] in ''A Comedy Salute to Andy Kaufman'' said of him: "No one has ever done what Andy did, and did it as well, and no one will ever. Because he did it first. So did [[Buster Keaton]], so did Andy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|type=TV production|title=A Comedy Salute to Andy Kaufman|airdate=March 29, 1995|publisher=NBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carl Reiner]] recalled his distinction in the comedy world: &lt;blockquote&gt;Did Andy influence comedy? No. Because nobody's doing what he did. Jim Carrey was influenced—not to do what Andy did, but to follow his own drummer. I think Andy did that for a lot of people. Follow your own drumbeat. You didn't have to go up there and say 'take my wife, please.' You could do anything that struck you as entertaining.
