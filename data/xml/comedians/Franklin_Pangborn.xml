'''Franklin Pangborn''' (January 23, 1889 – July 20, 1958) was an American comedic character actor. Pangborn was famous for [[Bit part|small]], but memorable roles, with a comic flair. He appeared in many [[Preston Sturges]] movies as well as the [[W. C. Fields]] films ''[[International House (1933 film)|International House]]'', ''[[The Bank Dick]]'', and ''[[Never Give a Sucker an Even Break]]''. For his contributions to motion pictures, Pangborn received a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 1500 [[Vine Street]] on February 8, 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.walkoffame.com/franklin-pangborn|title=Franklin Pangborn {{!}} Hollywood Walk of Fame|website=www.walkoffame.com|access-date=2016-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/franklin-pangborn/|title=Franklin Pangborn|website=latimes.com|access-date=2016-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pangborn was born in [[Newark, New Jersey]].

==Career==
In the early 1930s, Pangborn worked in short subjects for [[Mack Sennett]], [[Hal Roach]], [[Universal Pictures]], [[Columbia Pictures]], and [[Pathé Exchange]], almost always in [[Supporting actor|support]] of the [[Leading actor|leading players]]. (He played a befuddled photographer opposite [[George McFarland|"Spanky" McFarland]] in the ''[[Our Gang]]'' [[short subject]] ''[[Wild Poses]]'', for example.) He also appeared in scores of feature films in small roles, [[Cameo appearance|cameos]], and in recurring [[Visual gag|gags]] of various types.

One of those character actors who always played essentially the same character no matter the situation, Pangborn portrayed a prissy type of person, [[Politeness|polite]], elegant, and highly [[Energy|energetic]], often officious, fastidious, somewhat nervous, prone to becoming flustered but essentially upbeat, and with an immediately recognizable high-speed patter-type speech pattern.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} He typically played an officious desk clerk in a hotel, a self-important musician, a fastidious [[Head Waiter|headwaiter]], an enthusiastic [[Birdwatching|birdwatcher]], and the like, and was usually put in a situation of frustration or was comedically flustered by someone else's topsy-turvy antics.

Pangborn's screen character, which might be described at times as prissy or flighty, was often considered a [[LGBT stereotypes|gay stereotype]], although such a topic was too sensitive in his day to be discussed overtly in the dialogue. A rare exception occurred in ''[[International House (1933 film)|International House]]'', which was filmed before the [[Production Code|Hays Office]] fully censored filmmaking, and was notable for several risqué references (by 1933 standards). In one scene, Professor Quail, played by [[W. C. Fields]], has just landed his [[autogyro]] on the roof of the titular hotel in the Chinese city of [[Wuhu]], but he does not know where he is. Pangborn plays the [[hotel manager]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt; 
Professor Quail: Hey! Where am I?

Woman: Wu-Hu.

Professor Quail: Woo-Hoo to you sweetheart! Hey Charlie! where am I?

Pangborn: WU-HU!

(Fields then removes the flower from his lapel)

Professor Quail: Don't let the posy fool you!
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Pangborn was an effective [[Comedic foil|foil]] for many major comedians, including Fields, [[Harold Lloyd]], [[Olsen and Johnson]], and [[The Ritz Brothers]]. He appeared regularly in comedies (including several directed by [[Preston Sturges]]) and [[Musical film|musicals]] of the 1940s. When movie roles became scarce, he worked in television, including ''[[The Red Skelton Show]]'' (in which he played a [[Murder]]ous [[Banditry|bandit]]) and a ''[[This Is Your Life]]'' tribute to his old boss, [[Mack Sennett]]. Pangborn was briefly the announcer on [[Jack Paar]]'s ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' in 1957, but was fired after the first few weeks for a lack of "spontaneous enthusiasm" and replaced by [[Hugh Downs]]. 

Pangborn's final public performance came as a supporting player in ''[[The Red Skelton Show]]'' episode for April 22, 1958.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/download/Red_Skelton_FranklinPangbornGuest/red03FranklinPangborn_512kb.mp4 Franklin Pangborn's last performance], on ''The Red Skelton Show'', April 22, 1958&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Pangborn lived in [[Laguna Beach, California|Laguna Beach]], California in a house with his mother and his "occasional boyfriend" according to William Mann in ''Behind the Screen''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Behind the Screen: How Gays and Lesbians Shaped Hollywood, 1910–1969 | first=William J. | last=Mann | authorlink=William J. Mann | page=133 | publisher=Viking | date= October 11, 2001 | ISBN=978-0-670-03017-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died on July 20, 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Obituary – Franklin Pangborn| date= July 23, 1958|work= [[Los Angeles Times]] |page=C12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
