'''Mark Russell''' (born August 23, 1932), is an American [[political satirist]] and [[comedian]] best known for his [[parody music]], which he performs while accompanying himself on piano.

==Early life==
Mark Russell was born Mark Ruslander (he changed his name for stage purposes) and grew up in [[Buffalo, New York]], where he graduated from [[Canisius High School]]. After high school, his family moved briefly to Florida, then to Washington, D.C., where he enrolled at [[George Washington University]], but stayed for only a month. He then joined the [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]].&lt;ref name=CSM_Sweeney_19800410&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=December 21, 2008|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/1980/0410/041051.html|date=April 10, 1980|title=Mark Russell Star-spangled satirist|first=Louise |last=Sweeney|work=Christian Science Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Russell is known for his series of [[PBS]] specials, aired live at least four times a year between 1975 and 2004. His comedy specials were a mix of political stand-up comedy covering current events and musical parodies, in which he accompanied himself on his trademark American flag themed piano. Russell's song parodies use melodies from old standards with new humorous lyrics pertinent to the subject matter. For example, in 1990, following the execution of the Romanian dictator [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]], Russell did a parody song on his show to the tune of "Chattanooga Choo-Choo". ("Pardon me, boys / Are you the cats who shot Ceauşescu? / You made my day / The way you blew him away.") Russell himself admits that most of his jokes and songs are very topical and have "a shelf life shorter than cottage cheese".{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

While Russell's humor is known for skewering [[United States Democratic Party|Democrats]] and [[United States Republican Party|Republicans]] alike, his humorous tirades have also poked fun at [[Third party (politics)|third party]], [[Independent (politician)|independent]] politicians and other prominent political (and sometimes non-political) figures.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

Russell has often been asked the question, "Do you have any writers?" His standard response is "Oh, yes. I have 535 writers. 100 in the [[United States Senate|Senate]] and 435 in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]!" When asked if his views on current events are too caustic, Russell replies, "I follow the old newsman's adage. As they say, 'I don't make the news. I just report it.' And in my case, I don't even make the jokes. I just report them as they masquerade as news."{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

For several years, on the Sunday before [[Labor Day]], Russell has made an annual appearance on the [[NBC]] news program ''[[Meet the Press]]'', which was hosted from 1991–2008 by [[Tim Russert]], also a Canisius High graduate.

Beginning in the early 1960s, he was a regular entertainer at the [[Shoreham Hotel]] in Washington, D.C..{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} He gained national recognition with a series of comedy albums during the [[Watergate scandal]]{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} and did his first public television show in 1975. From 1979 to 1984, he was a semi-regular host on the reality TV show, ''[[Real People]]''.

In 1994, Russell found himself unexpectedly allied with the rap group [[2 Live Crew]], when the group was sued for copyright infringement for their parody of the song "[[Oh, Pretty Woman]]". The case went to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], where Russell and the members of 2 Live Crew argued that song parodies were protected under [[fair use]]. The Supreme Court agreed, and ruled in favor of Russell and 2 Live Crew (''[[Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.]]'').{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

In 2010, Russell announced his retirement from public performances and made his last public performance in July 2010 in [[Chautauqua, New York]]. He continues to write political humor for various venues.&lt;ref name=Russell_Website_Retirement&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=October 25, 2011
|url=http://www.markrussell.net/index.php/component/content/article/9-uncategorised/71-a-note|title=A Note from Mark|work=markrussell.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2013, Russell began to tour and perform publicly again. His final performance was October 30, 2016, at the [[Carolina Theatre of Greensboro|Carolina Theatre]] in [[Greensboro, North Carolina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.greensboro.com/go_triad/mark-russell-to-perform-his-last-show-right-here-in/article_7efc70f4-dbd7-51f6-846e-f0fb97b80ac9.html|title=Mark Russell to perform his last show, right here in Greensboro|last=DeCwikiel-Kane|first=Dawn|work=[[News &amp; Record]]|date=October 27, 2016|accessdate=October 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular media==
Russell was portrayed by [[Mark McKinney]] in a 1996 episode of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/cast/mark-mckinney-14786/impersonation/mark-russell-90121 NBC]&lt;/ref&gt;

Russell was parodied in an episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]'' (season three's "[[Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington]]"), in which a character modeled on him sings songs including "The Deficit Rag" and "The Trading Gap Shuffle".

In the ''[[NewsRadio]]'' episode "The Public Domain" (1997), [[Phil Hartman]]'s character Bill McNeill is inspired by Russell to start a career as a singing political comedian.&lt;ref&gt;[https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0660234/plotsummary?ref_=m_tt_stry_pl]&lt;/ref&gt;

An electronic version of the patriotic standard "[[Yankee Doodle]]" was used in the opening animated sequence for Russell's PBS specials that aired from 1975 to 2004, while a [[Dixieland]] arrangement of the song "[[Happy Days Are Here Again]]" was used for his entrance and as the closing theme.

He is mentioned in ''[[The King of Queens]]'' episode, "Tank Heaven".

==Awards==
In 2003 Russell was the recipient of the Buffalo Broadcasters Hall of Fame Buffalo Bob Award which is awarded annually to a Buffalo native who has achieved success in broadcasting outside of the Niagara Frontier area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buffalohistoryworks.com/broadcasters/hof_2004.asp|title=Buffalo Broadcasting Hall of Fame Inductees|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151009054520/http://www.buffalohistoryworks.com/broadcasters/hof_2004.asp|archivedate=2015-10-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
