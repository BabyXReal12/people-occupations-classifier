==Personal life==

Her family is Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/arts/article/live_from_hillel_its_laraine_20030124/|title=Live From Hillel—It’s Laraine! - Arts|work=Jewish Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is the youngest of four children and a twin (brother Paul).

Newman took her first [[Improvisational theatre]] classes when she was 15. After finishing high school she auditioned for four acting schools in England including [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]], [[London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art]] and [[Bristol Old Vic]]. She was not accepted after the second round of auditions for all four schools, so she went to Paris to study [[mime]] with [[Marcel Marceau]] for a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earwolf.com/episode/snl-reunion//|title=SNL Reunion|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She is a founding member of [[The Groundlings]] and is best known for being an original cast member on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', appearing on the show from its inception in 1975 through 1980. She originated the characters of Sheri the Valley Girl and [[Coneheads|Connie Conehead]], among others:

" ...my favorite character that I created at ''Saturday Night Live'', which, I think, only pleased me and no one else, was [[Lina Wertmuller]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xfinity.comcast.net/blogs/tv/2009/06/06/snls-laraine-newman-where-is-she-now/|title=SNL’s Laraine Newman: Where Is She Now?|author=Comcast Interactive Media|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During her five years on ''SNL'' she became a close friend of co-star [[Gilda Radner]] (although there was also a degree of rivalry between them).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2002/09/snl200209|title=It's Saturday Night!|author=Tom Shales and James Andrew Miller|work=Vanity Fair}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by her own account, she was unhappy for much of her time with the show&amp;mdash;she disliked living in New York.
