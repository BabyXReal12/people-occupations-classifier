'''Richard Fulcher''' (born November 18, 1968) is an American comedian and author based in the United Kingdom. He is best known for his roles in the British comedy series ''[[The Mighty Boosh]]'' and as Edward Sheath in the American series ''[[Jon Benjamin Has a Van]]''. He also makes appearances in [[Noel Fielding]]'s more recent show, ''[[Noel Fielding's Luxury Comedy]]''. His other appearances include ''[[Snuff Box (TV series)|Snuff Box]]'' alongside [[Matt Berry]] and ''[[Unnatural Acts (TV series)|Unnatural Acts]]'' with [[Julian Barratt]] and Fielding of ''The Mighty Boosh''.

==Early life==
Fulcher was born in Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URqUgz6zYv0&amp;feature=related |title=Carpool Rich Fulcher |publisher=YouTube |date=November 9, 2010 |accessdate=August 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[St. Albans School (Washington, DC)|St. Albans School]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], and then studied as a lawyer (earning a degree in government from [[Dartmouth College]]) but after graduating pursued a career in comedy instead.  He took to improvised comedy at the [[ImprovOlympic]] in [[Chicago]], where he was one of the early members of the [[Upright Citizens Brigade]].

Beginning in late 1992 in Chicago, Rich began working on a new long-form improvisational comedy concept – a completely improvised university lecture that would become known as Modern Problems In Science. After several months of rehearsing, Fulcher, Dick Costolo and Phil Granchi launched the show at Chicago's Annoyance Theater under the direction of Tom Keevers. The show played at the Annoyance for more than a year, after which the group took the show to the 1994 [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]]. The show became an underground hit and placed Fulcher firmly on British comedic soil. The show later toured at comedy festivals in Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, Canada and Singapore, with a run at the Bloomsbury Theatre in London. Fulcher and the group performed the show at the '95 and '96 Edinburgh Fringe, after which time the show was made into a six-part television series for the Paramount Channel UK.

==''The Mighty Boosh''==
Fulcher has played many types of characters but is perhaps best known for playing dull-witted, comic goons. He is probably most famous for his portrayal of [[Bob Fossil]] in ''[[The Mighty Boosh]]'' stage, radio and television shows, as well as playing many other characters, including the [[List of minor characters from The Mighty Boosh#Ape of Death|Ape of Death]] and [[List of recurring characters from The Mighty Boosh#Lester Corncrake|Lester Corncrake]]. He is also the only writer to provide additional material for the TV series apart from the major writers [[Noel Fielding]] and [[Julian Barratt]]. Fulcher has a variety of running gags on ''The Mighty Boosh'': he often plays very short characters, performing them on his knees, and when he plays various [[cockney]] characters he can be heard muttering, "I'm a cockney, I'm a cockney..." His ''Boosh'' characters often die horribly, being grated or otherwise murdered, and as this happens Fulcher will sometimes say, "A little to the left!" It was also in ''The Mighty Boosh'' that he met [[Matt Berry]], who played Dixon Bainbridge. In the documentary ''A Journey Through Time and Space'' he was said to be the only person who plays a "watered down version of himself". Fulcher claims that after portraying 'Tommy Nooka' people came up to him in the street and demanded that he 'do Tommy'.

==''Snuff Box''==
Rich Fulcher was a star and major writer for the [[BBC Three]] sketch show ''[[Snuff Box]]'', along with [[Matt Berry]], whom he met on the set of ''[[The Mighty Boosh]]''. Berry plays the High Executioner to the King of England and Fulcher his assistant. He also plays other minor characters in the series. ''Snuff Box'' was only aired once on BBC Three (Feb – April 2006) and was released on DVD in the UK in June 2008.

==''Tiny Acts of Rebellion''==
In 2009, Rich authored the book ''Tiny Acts of Rebellion'' published by Michael O'Mara Books Ltd in the UK (and in the US in 2010) and illustrated by [[Mr Bingo|Mr. Bingo]]. He has made several publicity appearances in promotion of the book at book signings in Europe and the US, as well as on Episode 51 of the radio show/podcast ''[[Comedy Death-Ray Radio]]''. Tiny Acts was also adapted into a stage show which sold out at the Edinburgh Fringe and its Soho Theatre run. It co-starred [[Arnab Chanda]] and was directed by [http://deansbomb.tumblr.com/ Harry Deansway]
