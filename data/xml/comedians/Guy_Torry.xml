'''Robert "Guy" Torry''' (born January 12, 1969) is an American [[actor]] and [[comedian]]. He is the younger brother of actor and comedian [[Joe Torry]].

==Early life==
Guy Torry was born in Fort Ord Military Base in California, where his father was stationed.  He moved to St. Louis at about 5 years of age.  He attended [[Southeast Missouri State University]] where fellow comedian and St. Louisan [[Cedric the Entertainer]] attended. While attending college, Torry developed his talent for comedy. After college, Guy eventually took his talents to [[Hollywood]], where he took up comedy and acting.

==Career==
Guy Torry began his acting career around the age of 17. He made minor appearances on shows such as ''[[Martin (TV series)|Martin]]''. In 1997, he became a regular cast member of [[UPN]]'s short-lived sitcom ''[[Good News (TV series)|Good News]]''. He eventually started touring all around the world doing stand-up comedy, with numerous sold-out events and standing ovations. He appeared on ''Def Jam Comedy'', which was another successful comedy show that featured his brother Joe as one of the hosts, as well as appearances on [[Comedy Central]] and ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]''. Also, he created and hosted a very successful weekly comedy show called ''Phat Tuesdays'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tribute.ca/people/guy-torry/7551/ "Guy Torry Bio", Tribute.ca.]&lt;/ref&gt; at one of America's most famous comedy hubs "The Comedy Store." ''Phat Tuesdays'' formed in 1995 and lasted for 10 years. Guy Torry was also an original member of the ''Kings of Comedy'' in 1998, where he hosted for the first year. He could not continue the second year due to a starring role he landed on the UPN action-drama ''[[The Strip (U.S. TV series)|The Strip]]''. He also wrote for other television series such as ''Martin'' and ''[[Moesha]]'' among others. He started breaking into films in the mid-1990s and since then has had parts in many films, including ''[[Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood]]'', ''[[Life (1999 film)|Life]]'', and ''[[Trippin' (film)|Trippin']]''. His most notable role was as a convict named Lamont in ''[[American History X]]'', who helped turn a young [[Nazi-skinhead]]'s life around while in [[prison]], and had a small part in the 2001 film ''Pearl Harbor'', playing a sailor assigned to the {{USS|Arizona|BB-39|6}}. In 2003 Torry's brother founded a film production company called MO Films, and Guy is slated to be an actor, writer, and producer of various projects from the company. He also works on ''The Tony Scott Morning Show'' along with host [[Tony Scott]] and Tammy Holland.

===Charity work===
His brother founded the Giving Back the Love Foundation in 1996 and ever since then Guy has been an avid supporter of the program.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0868956/bio Biography at IMDb.]&lt;/ref&gt; This foundation gives back to his hometown community (St. Louis) through youth and community programs. He also donated his time and sometimes money to other charity foundations of celebrity athletes such as: NFL Football players [[Terrell Owens]], [[Marshall Faulk]], Torrey and Terrence Holt, [[Ronald Curry]], [[Andre Johnson]], Ray Lewis, NBA Basketball players [[Shaquille O'Neal]], Jimmy Jackson, [[Magic Johnson]], [[Tarence Kinsey]], Chris Weber, The NBA Entertainment League, and several other charities, including the Celebrity Cat Walk, Shoes For Africa,and the LA Union Rescue Mission for Thanksgiving and Christmas.
