'''David Khari Webber Chappelle''' ({{IPAc-en|ʃ|ə|ˈ|p|ɛ|l}}; born August 24, 1973) is an American stand-up comedian, actor, writer, and producer. After beginning his film career in 1993 as Ahchoo in [[Mel Brooks]]' ''[[Robin Hood: Men in Tights]]'', he landed supporting roles in box office hits including ''[[The Nutty Professor (1996 film)|The Nutty Professor]]'', ''[[Con Air]]'', ''[[You've Got Mail]]'', ''[[Blue Streak (film)|Blue Streak]]'' and ''[[Undercover Brother]]''. His first lead role was in the 1998 comedy film ''[[Half Baked]]'', which he co-wrote with [[Neal Brennan]]. Chappelle also starred in the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] TV series ''[[Buddies (TV series)|Buddies]]''. His comedy focuses on racism, relationship problems, social problems, politics, current events, and pop culture.

In 2003, Chappelle became more widely known for his [[sketch comedy]] television series, ''[[Chappelle's Show]]'', also co-written with Brennan, which ran until his retirement from the show two years later. After leaving the show, Chappelle returned to performing stand-up comedy across the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sonicawareness.net/post/60640495538/show-recap-dave-chappelle-flight-of-the-conchords|title=Show Recap Dave Chappelle and Flight of the Conchords|publisher=Sonicawareness.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 he signed a $20 million-per-release comedy-special deal with Netflix, which has released four of his specials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/dave-chappelle-netflix-stand-up-special-fourth-the-bird-revelation-1202647930/|title=Dave Chappelle to Drop Two Netflix Specials on New Year’s Eve|first=Joe|last=Otterson|date=22 December 2017|website=Variety.com|accessdate=29 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2006, Chappelle was called the "comic genius of America" by ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]''&lt;ref name="esquire"/&gt; and, in 2013, "the best" by a ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' writer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/list/1532254/chappelles-show-10-best-musical-sketches|title= Chappelle's Show: 10 Best Musical Sketches|publisher=''Billboard''}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked him No. 9 in their "50 Best Stand Up Comics of All Time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/lists/50-best-stand-up-comics-of-all-time-w464199/mort-sahl-w464257|title=50 Best Stand-Up Comics of All Time|first=Matthew|last=Love|date=14 February 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chappelle was awarded an [[69th Primetime Emmy Awards|Emmy Award]] for his guest appearance on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' In 2017.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/2017-emmy-award-winners/|title= 2017 Emmy Award Winners|publisher=''Rotten Tomatoes''}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received a [[60th Annual Grammy Awards|Grammy Award]] for his [[Netflix]]  specials ''The Age of Spin &amp; Deep in the Heart of Texas''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jan/28/grammy-awards-2018-the-full-list-of-winners|title=Grammys awards 2018: full list of winners|date=29 January 2018|work=The Guardian|accessdate=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
David Khari Webber Chappelle was born in [[Washington, D.C.]] on August 24, 1973,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Obituaries: Henry T.

Chappelle]], a former president of [[Allen University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thestate.com/news/local/article130740989.html|title=Comedian Dave Chappelle given keys to city|work=thestate|access-date=2017-03-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chappelle grew up in [[Silver Spring, Maryland]], and attended [[Woodlin Elementary School]].&lt;ref name="InsideActorsStudio"/&gt; His parents were politically active, and family house visitors included [[Pete Seeger]] and [[Johnny Hartman]].&lt;ref name=esquire/&gt; The latter predicted Chappelle would be a comedian and, around this time, Chappelle's comic inspiration came from [[Eddie Murphy]] and [[Richard Pryor]]. After his parents separated, Chappelle stayed in Washington with his mother while spending summers with his father in [[Ohio]]. In 1991, he graduated from Washington's [[Duke Ellington School of the Arts]], where he studied [[theatre arts]].&lt;ref name="InsideActorsStudio"/&gt;

== Career ==

=== Early career ===
Chappelle moved to [[New York City]] to pursue a career as a comedian. He performed at [[Harlem]]'s famed [[Apollo Theater]] in front of the infamous "Amateur Night" audience, but he was [[booing|boo]]ed off stage. Chappelle described the experience as the moment that gave him the courage to continue his show business aspirations.&lt;ref name="InsideActorsStudio"/&gt; He quickly made a name for himself on the New York comedy circuit, even performing in the city's parks.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} In 1992, he won critical and popular acclaim for his television appearance in Russell Simmons' Def Comedy Jam on HBO. It was his appearance on this show that allowed his popularity to really begin rising, eventually allowing him to become a regular guest on late-night television shows such as Politically Incorrect, The Late Show With David Letterman, The Howard Stern Show, and Late Night With Conan O'Brien. [[Whoopi Goldberg]] even nicknamed him "The Kid".&lt;ref name="esquire"/&gt; At 19, he made his film debut as "Ahchoo" in [[Mel Brooks]]' ''[[Robin Hood: Men in Tights]]''. He also appeared on [[Star Search]] three times but lost over competing comedian [[Lester Barrie]]; Dave later joked about the irony of him ultimately becoming more successful than Barrie. The same year, Chappelle was offered the role of Benjamin Buford "Bubba" Blue in ''[[Forrest Gump]]''.  Concerned the character was demeaning and the movie would bomb, he turned down the part.&lt;ref name="ajc2007"&gt;Staff report (August 23, 2007).

''[[Rolling Stone]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

He attracted the attention of TV network executives and developed numerous [[television pilot|pilot]]s but none were picked up for development into a series.&lt;ref name="InsideActorsStudio"/&gt;&lt;ref name=freedom&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/10/19/60II/main650149.shtml|title = Chappelle: 'An Act of Freedom'|work=[[60 Minutes II]] |publisher=[[CBS News]]|author=Leung, Rebecca|date=December 29, 2004|accessdate = 2007-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, he made a guest appearance on an episode of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s popular [[situation comedy|sitcom]] ''[[Home Improvement (TV series)|Home Improvement]]''. The storyline had Chappelle and real-life friend and comedian [[Jim Breuer]] ask [[Tim Taylor (fictional character)|Tim Taylor]] for advice on their girlfriends.&lt;ref name="latimes1995"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-04-16/news/tv-55110_1_abc-sitcom|title=Boys Will Be 'Buddies': ABC Sitcom Explores the Relationship and the Differences Between Best Friends|work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |author=Kleid, Beth| date=1995-04-16|accessdate=2013-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The characters' single outing in the episode proved so popular that ABC decided to give them their own [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] sitcom titled ''[[Buddies (TV series)|Buddies]]''. However, after taping a pilot episode, Jim Breuer was fired and replaced with actor [[Christopher Gartin]]. ''Buddies'' premiered in March 1996 to disappointing [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] and the show was canceled after only five episodes out of 13 that had been produced.

After the failure of ''Buddies'', Chappelle starred in another pilot. According to Chappelle, the network was uncomfortable with the [[African-American]] cast and wanted [[White American|white]] actors added.&lt;ref name="varietyhontz"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/1998/tv/news/tv-s-race-card-1117478261/|title=TV’s race card|publisher=''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''|author=Hontz, Jenny|date=1998-07-08|accessdate=2013-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chappelle resisted and subsequently accused the network of racism. Shortly afterwards, Chappelle's father died and returning to Ohio, he considered leaving the entertainment business.&lt;ref name="InsideActorsStudio"/&gt;&lt;ref name=freedom/&gt;

He later appeared as a nightclub comedian ("''women be shopping!''") in the 1996 comedy ''[[The Nutty Professor (1996 film)|The Nutty Professor]]'' starring [[Eddie Murphy]], one of his major comedic influences.  The movie grossed nearly $129 million on a budget of $54 million.&lt;ref name="boxofficenutty"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=nuttyprofessor.htm|title=The Nutty Professor (1996)|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had a minor role in 1997's ''[[Con Air]]'' which made $26 million after production costs.&lt;ref name="boxofficecon"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=conair.htm|title=Con Air (1997)|publisher=Box Office Mojo}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of 1998, he did a stand-up performance for [[HBO]] Comedy Half-Hour. That same year, he appeared in "Pilots and Pens Lost," a 1998 episode of ''[[The Larry Sanders Show]]'''s sixth season, in which he and the executives of the show's unnamed [[television network]] satirized the treatment that scriptwriters and show creators were subjected to, as well as the executives' knee-jerk tendencies toward [[Ethnic stereotype|racial stereotypes]].&lt;ref name="ifclarry"&gt;[http://www.ifc.com/shows/the-larry-sanders-show/episodes/season-6/pilots-and-pens-lost "Season 6, Episode 4: Pilots and Pens Lost"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107232154/http://www.ifc.com/shows/the-larry-sanders-show/episodes/season-6/pilots-and-pens-lost |date=2014-01-07 }}.

He and [[Neal Brennan]] co-wrote the 1998 [[cult film|cult]] [[stoner film]] ''[[Half Baked]]'', Chappelle's first starring role, about a group of [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]]-smoking friends trying to get their other friend out of jail.  It made money at the box office and remains a classic so-called "stoner" film, a genre that includes the "Cheech and Chong" films as well as more recent fare like [[Judd Apatow]]'s ''[[Pineapple Express (film)|Pineapple Express]]''.&lt;ref name="ewstoner"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0,,20483133_20362224_20445193,00.html|title=Stoner Flicks: 20 'High-Rated' Faves|newspaper=[[Entertainment Weekly]] | first1=Whitney|last1=Pastorek|first2=Jeff|last2=Labrecque|date=April 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mjcommovies"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marijuana.com/news/2013/05/top-10-marijuana-movies-from-up-in-smoke-to-half-baked-hollywood-loves-pot-flicks/ |title=Top 10 Marijuana Movies: From "Up In Smoke" to "Half Baked" Hollywood Loves Pot Flicks |publisher=Marijuana.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606214454/http://www.marijuana.com/news/2013/05/top-10-marijuana-movies-from-up-in-smoke-to-half-baked-hollywood-loves-pot-flicks/ |archivedate=June 6, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1998, Chappelle appeared as [[Tom Hanks]]' character's friend and confidant in ''[[You've Got Mail]]''. The $65 million movie made $115 million at the box office.&lt;ref name="boxofficemail"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=youvegotmail.htm|title=You've Got Mail|publisher=Box Office Mojo}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, he appeared in the [[Martin Lawrence]] film ''[[Blue Streak (film)|Blue Streak]]'', which made $117 million at the box office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=bluestreak.htm|title=Blue Streak (1999)|publisher=Box Office Mojo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Chappelle recorded his first hour-long [[HBO]] special, ''Dave Chappelle: Killin' Them Softly'', in [[Washington, DC]]. He followed this up with an appearance as "Conspiracy Brother" in the 2002 racial satire ''[[Undercover Brother]]''.&lt;ref name=NYTF&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/person/12383/Dave-Chappelle/filmography|title=Dave Chappelle: Filmography|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2003–2006: ''Chappelle's Show'' ===
{{main|Chappelle's Show}}
[[File:DaveChappelle.jpg|alt=Dave Chappelle in 2003.|thumb|right|Chappelle in 2003]]
In 2003, Chappelle debuted his own weekly [[sketch comedy]] show on [[Comedy Central]] called ''[[Chappelle's Show]]''.  The show parodied many aspects of American culture, including [[Ethnic stereotype|racial stereotypes]], politics and [[popular culture|pop culture]].  Along with comedy skits, the show also featured musical performances by mostly [[hip-hop music|hip-hop]] and [[soul (music)|soul]] artists. He promoted the work of other black comedians as well, most notably Paul Mooney and the late [[Charlie Murphy]].&lt;ref name=Als/&gt;

Due to the show's popularity, Comedy Central's new parent company [[Viacom]]&lt;ref name=esquire/&gt; reportedly offered Chappelle a $55 million contract (giving Chappelle a share of DVD sales) to continue production of ''Chappelle's Show'' for two more years, while allowing him to do side projects.  Chappelle has said that sketches are not his favorite form of comedy,&lt;ref name=esquire/&gt; and that the show's format was somewhat like [[short film]]s.

In June 2004, based on the popularity of the "[[Rick James]]" sketch, it was announced that Chappelle was in talks to portray James in a [[biopic]] from [[Paramount Pictures]], also owned by Viacom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1488300/06102004/story.jhtml|title = Dave Chappelle Is Rick James, Bitch!|publisher= [[MTV News]]|first = Alyssa|last = Rashbaum|date=June 10, 2004|accessdate = 2007-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; James' estate disagreed with the proposed comical tone of the film and put a halt to the talks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117955707.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1|title = Turner to script singer James's biopic|publisher= [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|first = Michael|last = Fleming|date=December 13, 2006|accessdate = 2007-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That same month, Chappelle recorded his second comedy special, this time airing on [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]], ''Dave Chappelle: For What It's Worth'', at [[San Francisco]]'s [[The Fillmore|Fillmore Auditorium]], where his idols, including [[Lenny Bruce]], [[George Carlin]], [[Richard Pryor]], and [[Robin Williams]], had performed.

==== Season 3 problems ====
In a June 2004 stand-up performance in [[Sacramento, California]], Chappelle walked off the stage after berating his audience for constantly shouting "I'm [[Rick James]], bitch!" which had become a [[catchphrase]] from his popular "Rick James" sketch. After a few minutes, Chappelle returned and resumed by saying, "The show is ruining my life." He stated that he disliked working "20 hours a day" and that the popularity of the show was making it difficult for him to continue his stand-up career, which was "the most important thing" to him.  He told the audience:

{{quote|You know why my show is good? Because the network officials say you're not smart enough to get what I'm doing, and every day I fight for you. I tell them how smart you are. Turns out, I was wrong. You people are stupid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Dave Chappelle lets rude crowd have it, sticks up for Cosby's comment|newspaper= [[Sacramento Bee]]|first = Jim|last = Carnes|date=June 18, 2004|accessdate = 2007-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Season 3 was scheduled to begin airing on May 31, 2005, but earlier in May, Chappelle stunned fans and the entertainment industry when he abruptly left during production and took a trip to South Africa.&lt;ref name="esquire"/&gt; Chappelle said that he was unhappy with the direction the show had taken, and expressed in an interview with ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' his need for reflection in the face of tremendous stress:

Immediately following Chappelle's departure, tabloids speculated that Chappelle's exit was driven by drug addiction or a mental health issue, rather than the ethical and personal concerns as Chappelle stated.&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt;

Chappelle's decision to quit the show meant walking away from his $50 million contract with Comedy Central,&lt;ref name=Als/&gt; and a rift with longtime collaborator [[Neal Brennan]].&lt;ref name=esquire/&gt;

Chappelle was interviewed for ''[[Inside the Actors Studio]]'' on December 18, 2005, at [[Pace University]]'s [[Michael Schimmel Center for the Arts]].  The show premiered on February 12, 2006.&lt;ref name="InsideActorsStudio" /&gt; Four days earlier, he had introduced the musical tribute to [[Sly Stone]] at the [[48th Annual Grammy Awards]].&lt;ref name=esquire/&gt;

Chappelle said on ''Inside the Actors Studio'' that the death of his father seven years prior influenced his decision to go to South Africa. By throwing himself into his work, he had not taken a chance to mourn his father's death. He also said the rumors that he was in drug or psychiatric treatment only persuaded him to stay in South Africa.&lt;ref name="InsideActorsStudio"/&gt; He said,

{{quote|I would go to work on the show and I felt awful every day, that's not the way it was. ... I felt like some kind of prostitute or something.

[[File:Dave Chappelle (cropped).jpg|alt=Dave Chappelle in October 2007.|thumb|left|Chappelle in October 2007]]
Chappelle said that he felt some of his sketches were "socially irresponsible".&lt;ref name="oprah"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oprah.com/oprahshow/Chappelles-Story/5|title=Chappelle's Story: Dave's Moral Dilemma|publisher=''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insidecable.blogsome.com/2006/07/07/dave-chappelle-on-360-tonight/ |title=Transcript: Interview With Dave Chappelle, July 7, 2006 |publisher=[[CNN]]|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061029205225/http://insidecable.blogsome.com/2006/07/07/dave-chappelle-on-360-tonight/ |archivedate=2006-10-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He singled out the "[[pixie]] sketch" in which pixies appear to people and encourage them to reinforce stereotypes of their races.  In the sketch, Chappelle is wearing [[blackface]] and is dressed as a character in a [[minstrel show]].&lt;ref name="fears"/&gt; According to Chappelle, during the filming of the sketch, a white crew member was laughing in a way that made him feel uncomfortable and made him question himself.&lt;ref name="oprah"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN"/&gt; Chappelle said, "It was the first time I felt that someone was not laughing with me but laughing at me."&lt;ref name="oprah"/&gt;

During these interviews, Chappelle did not rule out returning to ''Chappelle's Show'' to "finish what we started," but promised that he would not return without changes to the production, such as a better working environment.  He desired to donate half of the DVD sales to charity.&lt;ref name="oprah" /&gt; Chappelle expressed disdain at the possibility of his material from the unfinished third season being aired, saying that to do so would be "a bully move," and that he would not return to the show if Comedy Central were to air the unfinished material.&lt;ref name="CNN" /&gt; On July 9, 2006, Comedy Central aired the first episode of ''[[Chappelle's Show: The Lost Episodes]]''. After the DVD release, Chappelle was interviewed by [[Anderson Cooper]] on CNN and reiterated he would not return to ''[[Chappelle's Show]]''. An uncensored DVD release of the episodes was made available on July 25.

The show still plays in syndication on several television networks, despite the relatively small number of episodes compared to most American syndicated television programs.&lt;ref name="Wisniewski2009" /&gt;

In April 2007, Chappelle set a stand-up endurance record at the [[Laugh Factory]] Sunset Strip comedy club, beating comedian [[Dane Cook]]'s record of three hours and 50 minutes.  In December of the same year, Chappelle broke his own record with a time of six hours and 12 minutes.

Chappelle again appeared on ''Inside the Actors Studio'' and, in celebration of the show's 200th episode, he humorously interviewed the show's usual host, [[James Lipton]].  The episode aired on November 11, 2008.  He appeared again on ''Inside the Actors Studio'' in 2013, for its 250th episode.

In August 2011, Chappelle appeared at Comedy Jam in San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://humormillmag.com/dave-chappelle-chris-tucker-katt-williams-comedy-show-a-huge-success/|title=Dave Chappelle, Chris Tucker, Katt Williams Comedy Show A Huge Success!|date=2011-08-15|work=The Humor Mill|access-date=2017-03-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a stop in Hartford, Chappelle walked off the stage due to heckling from the crowd that lasted throughout his entire performance. The heckling was so raucous that it drowned out Chappelle's voice over the PA system and included chants of "White Power", a line used in a ''Chappelle's Show'' episode that was viewed as wildly inappropriate and out-of-context by other audience members who later wrote about the event.&lt;ref name="usatoday"&gt;Oldenburg, Ann (August 30, 2013).

The main results are that the linguistic features typically associated with the ethnic group in question are strengthened and exaggerated in order for the viewers to determine the characters’ ethnic origin more easily, and that the characters are often displayed as racial stereotypes.

One interpretation of this analogy is that Chappelle was placed in the position of a pawn serving entertainment executives to deliver irresponsible racial humor to white audiences, and the executives manipulated him into staying at ''Chappelle's Show'' through contractual maneuvers and deception.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vulture.com/2018/01/dave-chappelle-pimp-story-bird-revelation-close-read.html|title=A Close Read of the Pimp Story Dave Chappelle Tells in The Bird Revelation|last=Schilling|first=Dave|work=Vulture|access-date=2018-06-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/NetflixBestOf/comments/7o7192/discussion_what_is_the_meaning_of_the_bird/|title=r/NetflixBestOf - [DISCUSSION] What is the Meaning of the Bird Revelation story?|website=reddit|language=en|access-date=2018-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The comparison to prostitution here perhaps serves as an indication of Chappelle's desire to gain more control and autonomy over his comedy and delivering his perspective on race.

In April 2013, [[Charlie Sheen]] appeared on [[Conan (talk show)|Conan O'Brien's talk show]] and claimed that in 2011 he had laughed so hard while watching a ''Chappelle's Show'' episode that he experienced a ruptured [[hernia]], and was rushed to a hospital.&lt;ref name="huffingtonsheen"&gt;{{cite news|title=Charlie Sheen Blames Dave Chappelle, Testosterone Cream For 2010 Meltdown On 'Conan'|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/12/charlie-sheen-blames-dave-chappelle-meltdown_n_3070968.html|website=''Huffington Post'' | date= April 12, 2013 |access-date=March 27, 2014|author=&lt;!--Staff writer, not named--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2013, Chappelle's impersonation of [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] from ''Chappelle's Show'' was selected by the singer as the cover art for his single "[[Breakfast Can Wait]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://music-mix.ew.com/2013/08/19/prince-dave-chappelle/ |title=Dave Chappelle and Prince, together at last! (Sort of)|newspaper=Entertainment Weekly|date= |accessdate=2013-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influences ==
In his interview with ''[[Inside the Actors Studio]]'' host [[James Lipton]], he said that his biggest influences in comedy are [[Richard Pryor]], [[Eddie Murphy]], [[Chris Rock]], [[Paul Mooney (comedian)|Paul Mooney]], [[Roy Chubby Brown|Roy "Chubby" Brown]] and [[Mel Blanc]].&lt;ref name="InsideActorsStudio"/&gt;

When asked about his earliest influence on comedy, Chappelle said:

{{quote|You know who was a big influence on me that is really weird is [[Bugs Bunny]], that's just weird. If you watch a lot of the stuff I do, you can almost see the influence in it, because these animators would animate these performances that were off the hook, And the guy that, the guy that did the voices was Mel Blanc. This guy was like some kind of savant or genius or something, But they had some kind of real big comedic influence on me, like I liked those cartoons, I think that was my first real big comedy influence, was a rabbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://youtube.com/watch?v=jCFMhrmKUV8 |title=Dave Chappelle's Comedy Influenced By Bugs Bunny (2006) |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=2015-07-03 |accessdate=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

When asked about the biggest influence on him in comedy, Chappelle spoke of Richard Pryor:

{{quote|What a precedent he set. Not just as a comic, but as a dude. The fact that someone was able to open themselves wide-open like that. It's so hard to talk in front of people or to open yourself up to your closest friends. But to open yourself up for everybody: I freebase, I beat my women, I shot my car. And nobody's mad at Richard for that. They understand. Somehow they just understand. And when I was going through this thing this year, that is the example I would think to myself that gave me the courage to just go back on the stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://youtube.com/watch?v=Vfw3lRZRPjs |title=Dave Chappelle - Richard Pryor Influence |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=2015-12-03 |accessdate=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Personal life ==
Chappelle married Elaine Mendoza Erfe in 2001.&lt;ref name="esquire"/&gt; They live with their two sons&lt;ref name="fears"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7773670/site/newsweek/ |title=Fears of a Clown |publisher=[[Newsweek]] |first=Devin |last=Gordon |date=May 16, 2005 |accessdate=2007-03-20 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205143048/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7773670/site/newsweek/ |archivedate=2007-02-05 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/content/node/22774 |title=The sixth man |work=[[The A.V.

Chappelle told Yellow Springs' residents in September 2006, "Turns out you don't need $50 million to live around these parts, just a nice smile and a kind way about you. You guys are the best neighbors ever. That's why I came back and that's why I'm staying."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2006-09-11-chappelle-ohio_x.htm|title = Chappelle plans to stay in Ohio town|agency=Associated Press |work=[[USA Today]] |date=September 11, 2006|access-date=March 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chappelle converted to [[Islam]] in 1998. He told ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' in May 2005, "I don't normally talk about my religion publicly because I don't want people to associate me and my flaws with this beautiful thing. And I believe it is beautiful if you learn it the right way."&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Van Boom, Daniel (January 23, 2014).

''[[Daily Mail]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Chappelle appears in a video explaining the religious backstory of the [[Zamzam Well|Well of Zamzam]] in Mecca.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=West Dawn Media|title=Muslim Dave Chappelle talks Islamic beliefs|date=2017-05-25|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlpgjWst9cE|access-date=2018-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
