'''Daniel Lawrence Whitney''' (born February 17, 1963), known professionally by his [[stage name]] '''Larry the Cable Guy''', is an [[United States|American]] stand-up comedian, actor, producer, country music artist and former radio personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/person/357943/Larry-the-Cable-Guy/biography |title=Larry the Cable Guy |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=June 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was one of the members of the [[Blue Collar Comedy Tour]], a comedy troupe which included [[Bill Engvall]], [[Ron White]], and [[Jeff Foxworthy]] (with whom he has starred on ''[[Blue Collar TV]]'').

Larry the Cable Guy has released seven comedy albums, of which three have been certified [[gold album|gold]] by the [[RIAA]] for shipments of 500,000 copies and in addition has starred in three Blue Collar Comedy Tour–related films, as well as in ''[[Larry the Cable Guy: Health Inspector]]'', ''[[Delta Farce]]'', and ''[[Witless Protection]]'', as well as voicing [[Mater (Cars)|Mater]] in the [[Cars (franchise)|''Cars'' franchise]]. Whitney's catchphrase "Git-R-Done!" is also the title of his book.

On January 26, 2010, the TV channel [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History]] announced that it was ordering a series starring Whitney called ''[[Only in America with Larry the Cable Guy]]'', in which he would explore the country and immerse himself in different lifestyles, jobs, and hobbies.&lt;ref name="Reuters"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/01/27/us-history-idUSTRE60Q0PB20100127 |title=History orders Larry the Cable Guy series |agency=[[Reuters]]  |date=January 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first episode of the series aired on February 8, 2011.&lt;ref name="History Channel"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/shows/only-in-america-with-larry-the-cable-guy/episodes/ |title=Only in America with Larry the Cable Guy – episodes| publisher=[[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series finale aired August 28, 2013.

==Early life==

==Career==

===Radio career===
Whitney started his career in radio in the early 1990s when he made regular radio appearances on the nationally syndicated program, ''[[Ron and Ron|The Ron and Ron Show]]'', as well as other radio shows such as "The Bob and Tom show" ''The Chris Baker Show'' on [[KDGE]] and [[KEZO]]'s ''[[The Todd and Tyler Show]]'' in [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]], Nebraska, as well as the ''Kirk, [[Mark_Ondayko|Mark]], and [[R._Edward_Lopez|Lopez]]'' morning show on [[WIYY]] in [[Baltimore]], Maryland. He was also a frequent guest on ''[[The Johnny Dare Morning Show]]'' on 98.9/[[KQRC]], [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]]. 

He also appeared on [[WJRR]] in [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], Florida. He was brought to [[New England]] on ''Greg and the Morning Buzz'' on [[WHEB]] 100.3 and [[WGIR-FM]] 101.1 in [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire|Portsmouth]] and [[Manchester, New Hampshire|Manchester]], New Hampshire, respectively, doing two commentaries a week.

===Stand-up career===
[[File:Larry the Cable Guy at Resch Center.jpg|thumb|Larry the Cable Guy in performance at the Resch Center in Green Bay in 2015]]
Initially performing stand-up under his real name with limited success, he became famous after developing the Cable Guy character, a personality that he now maintains throughout his stage act. The Cable Guy character has a stereotypical [[redneck]] appearance and a thick Southern accent, recounts stories about his "family", and uses, among other common expressions, his own [[catchphrase]] "Git-R-Done!".

He says in interviews and in his autobiographical book ''GIT-R-DONE'' that he deliberately "turns on" the accent both on and off stage, because he may forget it if he kept his normal accent intact.&lt;ref name="deadfrog"&gt;[http://www.dead-frog.com/blog/entry/an_interview_with_larry_the_cable_guy/ An Interview with Larry the Cable Guy], Dead-Frog.com, June 15, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; He uses catchphrase humor, including "Lord, I apologize, and be with the starvin' Pygmies in New Guinea. Amen" after telling  jokes of questionable taste; and, "I don't care who ya are, that's funny right there" after jokes that evoke raucous laughter.

His first two comedy albums, ''Lord, I Apologize'' (2001) and ''The Right to Bare Arms'' (2005), have both been [[RIAA certification|certified]] [[gold album|gold]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]]. A third album, ''Morning Constitutions'', and its accompanying TV special were released in 2007.

===Other work===

Whitney was [[Roast (comedy)|roasted]] in a [[The Comedy Central Roast of Larry the Cable Guy|Comedy Central special]] on March 15, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comedycentral.com/press/press_releases/2009/010709_roastannouncement_larry.jhtml |title=Comedy Central To Rip More Than Flannel Sleeves – Network To Roast Larry The Cable Guy |publisher=Comedycentral.com |date=May 26, 2011 |accessdate=June 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 8, 2011, the première of his newest travelogue series, ''Only in America with Larry the Cable Guy'', was broadcast on the [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]].

==Personal life==
Whitney resides in [[Lincoln, Nebraska]], on a {{convert|180|acre|adj=on}} farm. On July 3, 2005, he married his wife, Cara. They have two children together: a son named Wyatt (born August 2, 2006) and a daughter named Reagan (born October 29, 2007). His hometown of [[Pawnee City, Nebraska]] has a street named after him. Whitney also donated money to buy new theatrical equipment for the local high school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jeff Korbelik / Gzo |url=http://journalstar.com/entertainment/arts-and-culture/article_6815bb36-4c79-53b5-a5a1-ac6fca22b290.html |title=Larry the Cable Guy still has hometown pride |publisher=Journalstar.com |date=July 3, 2009 |accessdate=June 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whitney is an avid [[Nebraska Cornhuskers football]] fan. His signature camouflage hat has the [[University of Nebraska-Lincoln]] nickname "HUSKERS" emblazoned on it which can be seen in the 2007 film ''[[Delta Farce]]''. He is also frequently seen with a gold Nebraska "N"  on a chain around his neck. On October 1, 2016, in his luxury suite at [[Memorial Stadium (Lincoln)|Memorial Stadium]] during the Nebraska vs. Illinois football game, Whitney was challenged to an arm wrestling match by an [[United States Army|Army]] veteran and [[Nebraska Army National Guard]] member, John O’Connell, who lost the match in less than one minute with his arm ([[humerus]]) broken by Whitney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Ernst | first = Douglas | title = Larry the Cable Guy breaks Army vet’s humerus while arm wrestling: ‘I’m retiring from arm wrestling after this’ | url = https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/oct/7/larry-the-cable-guy-uses-old-man-strength-breaks-a/ | newspaper = [[Washington Times]] | date = October 7, 2016 | access-date = January 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Huff | first = Steve | title = Arm-Wrestling Larry the Cable Guy | url = https://www.maxim.com/maxim-man/larry-the-cable-guy-arm-wrestling-2016-10 | work = [[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]] | date = October 8, 2016 | access-date = January 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Matteson | first = Cory | title = Larry the Cable Guy recounts arm wrestling that went awry | url = https://journalstar.com/entertainment/concerts/larry-the-cable-guy-recounts-arm-wrestling-that-went-awry/article_f0213363-5d64-53da-9d45-bf06746f79ef.html | newspaper = [[Lincoln Journal Star|Journal Star]] | location = [[Lincoln, Nebraska]] | date = March 30, 2017 | access-date = January 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whitney is also an avid [[REO Speedwagon]] fan. In 2013, he appeared with the group including a benefit concert in Bloomington, Illinois for tornado disaster relief,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.charlotteobserver.com/entertainment/music-news-reviews/article169764257.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--   briefly appearing with them on stage during one of their concerts at the [[CenturyLink Center Omaha|Centurylink Center Arena]] in Omaha, Nebraska. --&gt;

In September 2010, Whitney donated $5 million to the [[Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children]] in [[Orlando, Florida]]. The gift was for further development of the International Hip Dysplasia Institute at the Orlando hospital. After Dr. Chad Price at Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children helped cure their son, Wyatt, of his [[Hip dysplasia (human)|dysplasia]] when he was an infant, Whitney and his wife, Cara, made private donations to the hospital and Whitney raised money through appearances on ''[[Family Feud]]'' and ''[[Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?]]''. 

The hospital opened a new wing called the "Wyatt Whitney Wing" in May 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Gary.
