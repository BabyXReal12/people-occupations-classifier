'''James Christopher Gaffigan''' (born July 7, 1966) is an American stand-up comedian, actor, writer, and producer. He was raised in [[Chesterton, Indiana]]. His material is often about fatherhood, observations, laziness, and food. He is also regarded as a "clean" comic, using little profanity in his routines. He has had several successful comedy specials, including ''[[Jim Gaffigan: Mr. Universe|Mr. Universe]],'' ''Obsessed'', and ''Cinco,'' all three of which received Grammy nominations.  His memoir, ''Dad Is Fat'' (2013) and his most recent book, ''Food: A Love Story'' (2014), are both published by [[Crown Publishers]]. He co-created and starred in a [[TV Land]] television series based on his life called ''[[The Jim Gaffigan Show]]''.

He collaborates extensively with his wife, actress [[Jeannie Gaffigan]],&lt;ref name= NYTwedding&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/27/style/weddings-celebrations-jeannie-noth-jim-gaffigan.html | title= WEDDINGS/CELEBRATIONS; Jeannie Noth, Jim Gaffigan| date= July 27, 2003 | access-date= July 17, 2016| work= The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; and together they have five children. They are [[Catholic Church in the United States|Catholic]], a topic that comes up in his comedy, and live in [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]].

==Early life==
Gaffigan was born on July 7, 1966&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| date= July 1, 2013| title= Celeb birthdays for the week of July 7–13| agency= Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Elgin, Illinois,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chicagotribune.com/redeye/redeye-jim-gaffigan-perform-northerly-island-aug-6-20150803-story.html&lt;/ref&gt; the son of Marsha Mitchell and Michael A. Gaffigan.&lt;ref name= NYTwedding /&gt; He is the youngest of six children and often jokes about growing up in a large family.&lt;ref name=spin/&gt; His father, a banker, was the first in his family to attend college,&lt;ref name=stern/&gt; and he encouraged his children to seek careers that promised job security.&lt;ref name=steinberg&gt;{{cite news| last= Steinberg| first= Don| date= March 15, 2013| url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324128504578348662667932172 | title= The King of (Clean) Comedy| work= [[Wall Street Journal]] |volume= 261| number=61| pages=D1–D2 | access-date= July 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, at about the age of five, Jim announced that when he grew up, he wanted to be an "actress."&lt;ref name=suewhite&gt;{{cite news| last= White| first= Sue |date= December 20, 2011| url=  http://www.mlive.com/entertainment/saginaw/index.ssf/2011/12/inner_voice_is_the_secret_of_j.html |title= Inner voice is the secret of Jim Gaffigan's comedy, coming soon to Mount Pleasant| website= MLive.com | access-date= July 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a teenager, Jim watched ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.&lt;ref name=stern/&gt;  He attended [[La Lumiere School]] in [[La Porte, Indiana]], where he starred on the school's [[football]] team. He attended [[Purdue University]] for one year, where he was a member of the [[Phi Gamma Delta]] Fraternity, then transferred to [[Georgetown University]]'s [[McDonough School of Business]], where he graduated in 1988&lt;ref name=UTSanD&gt;{{cite web| url=http://articles.redeyechicago.com/2013-04-18/entertainment/38653726_1_chicago-theatre-deep-dish-pizza-northwest-indiana |title=Versatile comic Jim Gaffigan adds 'author' to his resume |website=RedEyeChicago.com |date=April 18, 2013 |accessdate=August 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a degree in Finance.&lt;ref name=steinberg/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jim Gaffigan: Biography| url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0300712/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm|website=IMDB.com| publisher= Internet Movie Database| accessdate= March 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played [[College football|varsity football]] at Georgetown and Purdue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet| user= jimgaffigan| number= 610861763089797120 | title= RT @HisAndHers Throwback to the days @JimGaffigan played college football for @georgetownhoyas | author= Gaffigan, Jim| date= June 16, 2015| access-date= July 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxsports.com/college-football/story/comedian-jim-gaffigan-was-once-a-football-walk-on-at-a-big-ten-school-081616|title=Comedian Jim Gaffigan once walked-on to a Big Ten football team|first=Aaron|last=Torres|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Stand-up===
[[File:JimGaffiganMay2008.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Gaffigan performing in May 2009]]
After graduating, Gaffigan moved to New York to pursue comedy,&lt;ref name=UTSanD /&gt; a move that was inspired by his admiration for [[David Letterman]].&lt;ref name=bigbreak/&gt; He found a job in advertising,&lt;ref name=steinberg/&gt; and he would work during the day and take acting classes at night.&lt;ref name=spin/&gt;&lt;ref name=bigbreak/&gt;  However, his career began in earnest when a friend from the class dared him to take a [[stand-up comedy|stand-up]] seminar that required a live set at the end.&lt;ref name=spin&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laughspin.com/2005/11/28/jim-gaffigan/ |title=Jim Gaffigan |website=Laugh Spin |date=November 28, 2005 |accessdate=January 20, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202203300/http://www.laughspin.com/2005/11/28/jim-gaffigan/ |archivedate=February 2, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= suewhite/&gt;  He fell in love with stand-up,&lt;ref name=spin/&gt; and began to play comedy clubs nightly—after his evening acting classes—until the wee hours of the morning.&lt;ref name=bigbreak&gt;{{cite news| date= July 19, 2015| url= https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=424403663 |title= From Adman To Stand-Up: Jim Gaffigan's Transition Took A Few Good Naps| work=My Big Break| publisher= NPR | access-date= July 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was often found sleeping on the job; his boss had to wake him up to fire him.&lt;ref name=bigbreak/&gt;  For the first seven years of his career, he tried various styles, ranging from angry comedy to impressions and voices.&lt;ref name=steinberg/&gt;  Also, live comedy was in decline following its peak of the 1980s, further affected by the increased popularity of [[cable television]].&lt;ref name=spin/&gt;  However, after a successful stand-up routine on ''[[The Late Show with David Letterman]]'', his career took off.&lt;ref name=bigbreak/&gt;

Gaffigan's style is largely [[Observational comedy|observational]], and his principal topics relate to laziness, eating, and parenthood.  He is famous for his [[Hot Pocket]] routine, which was inspired by a commercial he saw that he mistook for a ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' sketch.&lt;ref name=suewhite/&gt;  Also, during his routines, he will sometimes use a high-pitched voice and—in the third-person—deliver negative feedback on his own performance, such as after making a diarrhea joke in his 2012 special "Mr. Universe" using the voice and saying "Really, He's using diarrhea jokes?"&lt;ref name=stevens/&gt; He calls that voice his "connection with the audience."&lt;ref name=suewhite/&gt; In an interview with the ''[[Duluth News-Tribune]]'', he explained that the voice was developed over time, beginning as a teenager when he would disarm people by talking for them in their presence.&lt;ref name=bellamy/&gt;  He also used it as a way to fend off hecklers earlier in his career, when he says that comedy clubs were more combative.&lt;ref name=bellamy/&gt; He cursed early in his career, and he added cursing to his comedy album ''Doing My Time'', at the request of his label, in the hopes of drawing more teenagers.&lt;ref name=Schmidt&gt;{{cite news| last= Schmidt| first= Alex |date= April 26, 2014| url= http://www.pastemagazine.com/blogs/lists/2014/04/the-10-trials-of-jim-gaffigan.html |title= The 10 Trials of Jim Gaffigan| work=[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]| access-date=July 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he has largely removed profanity from his routine, as he feels that his subject matter doesn't lend itself to cursing and that it reduced the effort he put into crafting his jokes.&lt;ref name=Schmidt/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last= Brouk| first= Tim |date= September 6, 2007| title= Jim Gaffigan returns to his old stomping grounds, Purdue| work= [[Journal and Courier]]| url= | pages=1, 2D| access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jim has appeared at the "[[Just for Laughs]]" comedy festival in [[Montreal|Montreal, Quebec]] numerous times.

In 2004 Gaffigan's stand up material was featured in [[Comedy Central]]'s animated series ''Shorties Watchin' Shortie.'' October 2005, he filmed a live [[Comedy Central]] special that aired for the following January,&lt;ref name=spin/&gt; and became the comedy album/DVD ''[[Beyond the Pale (Jim Gaffigan album)|Beyond the Pale]]''.  The routine consisted primarily of material regarding food and American eating habits, and the comedian unknowingly predicted a future menu item at [[Dunkin Donuts]]—the 'glazed donut breakfast sandwich'—while commenting on the future of America's eating habits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Jim Gaffigan Predicted The Dunkin' Donuts Donut Sandwich | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/10/jim-gaffigan-predicted-dunkin-donut-sandwich_n_3574729.html#slide=1208178 |website=The Huffington Post |date=July 10, 2013 |accessdate=January 29, 2014 |first=Katla |last=McGlynn}}&lt;/ref&gt; His 2009 album ''[[King Baby (Jim Gaffigan album)|King Baby]]'' was also a television special filmed in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], [[Texas]], at the end of his "The Sexy Tour". Comedy Central released ''King Baby'' on DVD. In a March 2009 interview on ''[[Anytime with Bob Kushell]]'', Gaffigan defended his naming of the tour, stating that he thought it would be funny that parents would be unsure about whether to bring their teenage children to the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | title = Anytime with Bob Kushell feat. Jim Gaffigan | series = Anytime with Bob Kushell |air-date= March 24, 2009 | season = 2 | number = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four years later, on March 14, 2013, Gaffigan was named the "King of Clean" by the ''Wall Street Journal''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887324128504578348662667932172 |title= Jim Gaffigan Is the King of (Clean) Comedy| website=WSJ.com| date=March 14, 2013| accessdate=January 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 25, 2012, Gaffigan taped a one-hour stand-up special—''[[Jim Gaffigan: Mr. Universe|Mr. Universe]]''—at the [[Warner Theatre (Washington, D.C.)|Warner Theater]] in [[Washington, D.C.]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://jimgaffigan.com/appearances.shtml |title=Tour Dates |website=JimGaffigan.com |date= |accessdate=July 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was nominated for a Grammy.&lt;ref name=steinberg/&gt; He announced that, based on the business model used by [[Louis C.K.]]'s ''[[Live at the Beacon Theater]]'', the stand-up would be available online through his website for $5, with 20% of the total proceeds going to the [[Bob Woodruff|Bob Woodruff Foundation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Potts |first=Kimberly |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/02/15/us-jimgaffigan-idUSTRE81E21B20120215 |title=Louis C.K. inspires Jim Gaffigan to distribute own special |website=Reuters.com |date=February 15, 2012 |accessdate=July 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; an organization that provides support to military veterans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=John Carucci |agency=Associated Press |title=Comedian Jim Gaffigan Supports Veterans Through Woodruff Foundation |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/11/jim-gaffigan-woodruff-foundation_n_1418051.html |newspaper=Huffington Post |date=June 11, 2012 |access-date=January 29, 2015 }}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite news |author=Randi Kaye |author2=Troy Bentley |title=Randi Kaye speaks to comedian, Jim Gaffigan, who's supporting veterans' foundation with $5 stand-up special. |url=http://newsroom.blogs.cnn.com/2012/05/22/randi-kaye-speaks-to-comedian-jim-gaffigan-whos-supporting-veterans-foundation-with-5-stand-up-special/ |newspaper=CNN |date=May 22, 2012 |access-date=January 29, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2012, he was among the top-ten grossing comics in the US, according to Pollstar.&lt;ref name=steinberg/&gt;

Gaffigan filmed his 2014 comedy special titled ''[[Jim Gaffigan: Obsessed]]'' at [[Boston]]'s [[Wilbur Theater]] on January 18, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwcomedy/article/Comedy-Central-to-Premeire-New-Stand-Up-Special-JIM-GAFFIGAN-OBSESSED-427-20140407#.U3Da6q1dU8w | title= Comedy Central to premiere new standup special Jim Gaffigan: Obsessed, 4/27 |website=comedyworld.com |accessdate= May 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Obsessed'' premiered on [[Comedy Central]] on April 27 becoming the most watched stand-up comedy special of the year for the network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2014/04/30/jim-gaffigan-obsessed-is-comedy-centrals-most-watched-stand-up-special-since-april-2013/259277/ | title= Jim Gaffigan Obsessed is Comedy Centrals Most Watched Standup Special Since April 2013 |website= TVbythenumbers.com |accessdate= May 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The accompanying album, also titled ''Obsessed'', debuted at number 11 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and number 1 on the Billboard Comedy Album charts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/chart-alert/6084705/billboard-200-grateful-dead-jim-gaffigan-pixies |title=Chart Moves: Grateful Dead Notch Highest-Charting Album Since 1987, Jim Gaffigan's Stand-Up Sales Sizzle |website=Billboard.com |accessdate= May 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2015 saw him embark on a headlining tour, culminating in a winter show at [[Madison Square Garden]].&lt;ref name=stern/&gt;

Gaffigan has performed stand-up to support charitable causes as well. In 2002, he was part of a [[United Service Organization]] event at [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=3419 |title=GTMO Troops Get Comic Relief Courtesy Of 'Comedy Central' |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=September 10, 2002 |website=Navy.mil |publisher=United States Navy |accessdate=January 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaffigan performed at the 2013 [[Stand Up for Heroes]] charity event benefitting the [[Bob Woodruff Foundation]] alongside fellow stand-up comedians [[Jerry Seinfeld]], [[Bill Cosby]] and [[Jon Stewart]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bobwoodrufffoundation.org/stand-up-for-heroes-2013-raises-a-record-breaking-5-million/ |title=Stand Up for Heroes 2013 Raises a Record Breaking 5 Million |website=bobwoodrufffoundation.org |accessdate= May 13, 2014}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite news |author=Korina Lopez |title=Springsteen, Waters, comics honor veterans at benefit |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2013/11/07/springsteen-waters-comics-honor-veterans-at-stand-up-for-heroes-benefit/3465625/ |newspaper=USA Today |date=November 7, 2013 |access-date=January 29, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gaffigan also performed at the 2013 [[CNN Heroes]] event, which celebrates everyday heroes doing extraordinary work around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cnnpressroom.blogs.cnn.com/2013/11/07/celebrity-lineup-announced-for-2013-cnn-heroes-an-all-star-tribute/ |title=Celebrity Lineup Announced for 2013 CNN Heroes All Star Tribute |website= CNN.com |accessdate=May 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In May 2014, Gaffigan performed at the [[Make It Right Foundation|Make It Right]] Gala, an organization founded by [[Brad Pitt]], which builds sustainable homes and buildings for communities in need.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.people.com/article/brad-pitt-sandra-bullock-make-it-right-new-orleans-gala |title= Inside Brad Pitt's Star-Studded Party in New Orleans |website= [[People (magazine)|People]] |accessdate=June 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 26, 2015, he performed at the Festival of families, a Catholic event held in [[Philadelphia]]. Gaffigan was the only comedian on the bill at the festival, and the event was visited by [[Pope Francis]]. The event had more than one million attendees.

As of June 2016, Gaffigan was the most popular comic on all of [[Pandora.com]] with over 647 million spins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://theinterrobang.com/pandora-launches-new-comedy-features-celebrates-5-years-comedy-content| title= Guess Who Is the Most Played Comedian On Pandora |first= Bill |last= Tressler |date= June 21, 2016  | website= TheInterrobang.com | access-date= July 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, he embarked on his [[Fully Dressed Tour]], performing in the United States, Canada and the UK.

====Influences====
Gaffigan credits [[David Letterman]] and [[Bill Murray]] as influences, and he has asserted that [[Richard Pryor]] was the greatest stand-up comedian ever.&lt;ref name=stern/&gt; His comedy mentor was [[Dave Attell]], who he asserted was the only person who thought he was funny in his early stand-up years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/news/jim-gaffigan-biography-interview|title=Stand-Up Guy Jim Gaffigan on His New TV Land Show (INTERVIEW)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the episode of ''[[Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee]]'' which featured Gaffigan, he admitted that the show's host [[Jerry Seinfeld]] was a big influence for him.

====Reception====
Gaffigan is widely noted for being an [[everyman]] and a clean comic,&lt;ref name=steinberg/&gt;&lt;ref name=bellamy2/&gt; and signature routines regard [[Hot Pockets]],&lt;ref name=steinberg /&gt;&lt;ref name=wait/&gt;&lt;ref name=bellamy2&gt;{{cite news|title=Everyone's in on the joke at Gaffigan show|url=http://www.duluthnewstribune.com/features/ae/2338054-everyones-joke-gaffigan-show|language=en|last=Bellamy|first=Jimmy|date=July 27, 2013|publisher=Duluth News-Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; cake, and [[bacon]].&lt;ref name=stevens/&gt;  His tendency to avoid profanity has drawn mixed responses from audiences and critics.  One critic compared him to ''Full House''-era [[Bob Saget]] (who starred in the 1990s family show), which Gaffigan took as an insult.&lt;ref name=Schmidt/&gt;  However, Hampton Stevens in ''[[The Atlantic]]'' wrote that the comic champions "a vital element to standup that [[Lenny Bruce|[Lenny] Bruce]] had taken away—the indispensable, but apparently forgotten idea that comedians have no obligation to be provocative, topical, socially conscious, or anything else but funny."&lt;ref name=stevens&gt;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stevens|first1=Hampton|title=The Radical Averageness of Jim Gaffigan's Stand-Up lo|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2012/04/the-radical-averageness-of-jim-gaffigans-stand-up-comedy/255819/|website=The Atlantic|date=April 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to meeting his wife, actress Jeannie Noth, Gaffigan largely wrote alone.  However, while working on his first show, ''Welcome to New York'', he was overwhelmed and asked for input from her (then his friend). Although initially hesitant to have a collaborator, as their relationship grew, so did Noth's ability to write material for him.  Once they married, she left behind her work with her youth theater project (Shakespeare on the Playground) to devote herself to raising their expanding brood, and after a joke she wrote drew big laughs at a show, she and Jim began to collaborate more.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}  She gradually transferred into the position of Jim's chief co-writer, and they are now full writing partners.
