Colbert originally studied to be a dramatic actor, but became interested in [[improvisational theatre]] while attending [[Northwestern University]], where he met [[The Second City|Second City]] director [[Del Close]]. Colbert first performed professionally as an [[understudy]] for [[Steve Carell]] at [[Second City Chicago]], where his troupe mates included [[Paul Dinello]] and [[Amy Sedaris]], comedians with whom he developed the sketch comedy series, ''[[Exit 57]]''. He wrote and performed on the short-lived ''[[The Dana Carvey Show|Dana Carvey Show]]'' before collaborating with Sedaris and Dinello again on the cult television series ''[[Strangers with Candy]]''. He gained attention for his role on the latter as closeted gay history teacher [[Chuck Noblet]].

Colbert's work as a correspondent on Comedy Central's news-parody series ''[[The Daily Show]]'' gained him wide recognition. In 2005, he left ''The Daily Show'' to host ''The Colbert Report''. Following ''The Daily Show''{{'}}s news-parody concept, ''The Colbert Report'' was a parody of personality-driven political opinion shows including ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]'', in which he portrayed a [[Stephen Colbert (character)|caricatured version]] of [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] [[Pundit|political pundits]].  The series became one of Comedy Central's highest-rated series, earning Colbert an invitation to perform as featured entertainer [[Stephen Colbert at the 2006 White House Correspondents' Association Dinner|at the White House Correspondents' Association Dinner in 2006]]. After ending ''The Colbert Report'', he was hired in 2015 to succeed retiring [[David Letterman]] as host of the [[Late Show (CBS TV series)|''Late Show'']] on CBS. He hosted the [[69th Primetime Emmy Awards]] in September 2017.

Colbert has won nine [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s, two [[Grammy Award]]s, and two [[Peabody Awards]]. Colbert was named one of [[Time 100|''Time''{{'}}s 100 Most Influential People]] in 2006 and 2012.&lt;ref name="time100"&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1975813_1975838_1976306,00.html|title = Stephen Colbert&amp;nbsp;– The 2006 TIME 100&amp;nbsp;– TIME|author = Brian Williams|work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date = May 8, 2006|access-date = July 25, 2012|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120724022225/http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0%2C28804%2C1975813_1975838_1976306%2C00.html|archivedate = July 24, 2012|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="time100-1"&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2111975_2111976_2111953,00.html |title = Stephen Colbert&amp;nbsp;– 2012 TIME 100: The Most Influential People in the World&amp;nbsp;– TIME |author = Garry Trudeau |work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date = April 16, 2012 |access-date = July 25, 2012 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120725101401/http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0%2C28804%2C2111975_2111976_2111953%2C00.html |archivedate = July 25, 2012 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Colbert's book, ''[[I Am America (And So Can You!)]]'', listed #1 on [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]] in 2007.

His father, [[James William Colbert Jr.]], was an [[immunology|immunologist]] and medical school dean at [[Yale University]], [[Saint Louis University]], and finally at the [[Medical University of South Carolina]], where he served as vice president for academic affairs.

In interviews, Colbert has described his parents as devout people who also strongly valued intellectualism and taught their children that it was possible to question the church and still be Catholic.&lt;ref name=TimeOut&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeout.com/newyork/DetailsAr.do?file=hotseat/506/506.hotseat.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060820014908/http://www.timeout.com/newyork/DetailsAr.do?file=hotseat%2F506%2F506.hotseat.html |archivedate=August 20, 2006 |title=Joyce Words |first=David |last=Cote |work=[[Time Out New York]] |date=June 9, 2005 |access-date=July 30, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }} Via the [[Internet Archive]].&lt;/ref&gt; The emphasis his family placed on intelligence and his observation of negative stereotypes of Southerners led Colbert to train himself to suppress his [[Southern American English|Southern accent]] while he was still quite young.

As a child, he observed that Southerners were often depicted as being less intelligent than other characters on scripted television; to avoid that stereotype, he taught himself to imitate [[General American|the speech]] of American [[news presenter|news anchors]].&lt;ref name="freshair1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4464017|title=A Fake Newsman's Fake Newsman: Stephen Colbert|first=Terry|last=Gross|authorlink=Terry Gross|work=[[Fresh Air]]|publisher=[[NPR]]|date=January 24, 2005|access-date=July 11, 2007|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701141740/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4464017|archivedate=July 1, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="60minutes"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/04/27/60minutes/main1553506.shtml|title=The Colbert Report: Morley Safer Profiles Comedy Central's 'Fake' Newsman|first=Morley|last=Safer|authorlink=Morley Safer|work=[[60 Minutes]]|date=August 13, 2006|access-date=August 15, 2006|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060820141728/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/04/27/60minutes/main1553506.shtml|archivedate=August 20, 2006|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Colbert sometimes comedically claims his surname is French, he is of 15/16ths Irish ancestry (one of his paternal great-great-grandmothers was of German and English descent).&lt;ref&gt;Smolenyak, Megan. {{cite news|url=http://irishamerica.com/2015/01/stephen-colbert-one-last-report-its-genealogical|title=Stephen Colbert: One Last Report (It's Genealogical)|work=Irish America Magazine|access-date=March 26, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317031748/http://irishamerica.com/2015/01/stephen-colbert-one-last-report-its-genealogical/|archivedate=March 17, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gatesref"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gagnon|first=Geoffrey|title=Top of Mind: Extended Q &amp; A with Henry Louis Gates Jr.|work=Boston|year=2010|url=http://www.bostonmagazine.com/articles/skipgates/page2|access-date=February 4, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229050129/http://www.bostonmagazine.com/articles/skipgates/page2|archivedate=February 29, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of his ancestors emigrated from Ireland to North America in the 19th century before and during the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]].&lt;ref name="Faces"&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wnet/facesofamerica/profiles/stephen-colbert/11/ "Faces of America: Stephen Colbert"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100310164800/http://www.pbs.org/wnet/facesofamerica/profiles/stephen-colbert/11/ |date=March 10, 2010 }}, PBS, ''[[Faces of America (PBS series)|Faces of America]]'' series, with Professor [[Henry Louis Gates|Henry Louis Gates, Jr.]] (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pedigree"&gt;[http://colbert.ancestortree.net/pedigree.php "Pedigree of Stephen Colbert"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170214231610/http://colbert.ancestortree.net/pedigree.php |date=February 14, 2017 }}, AncestorTree.net; retrieved August 29, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, his surname was pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|oʊ|l|b|ər|t}} {{respell|KOHL|bərt}} in English; Stephen Colbert's father, James, wanted to pronounce the name {{IPAc-en|k|oʊ|l|ˈ|b|ɛər}} {{respell|kohl|BAIR|'}}, but maintained the {{IPA|/ˈkoʊlbərt/}} pronunciation out of respect for his own father. He offered his children the option to pronounce the name whichever way they preferred.&lt;ref name="charlestonian"/&gt; Stephen started using {{IPA|/koʊlˈbɛər/}} later in life when he transferred to [[Northwestern University]], taking advantage of the opportunity to reinvent himself in a new place where no one knew him.&lt;ref name="dowd"/&gt; Stephen's brother Edward, an intellectual property attorney, retained {{IPA|/ˈkoʊlbərt/}}; this was shown in a February 12, 2009, appearance on ''The Colbert Report'', when his youngest brother asked him, "{{IPA|/ˈkoʊlbərt/}} or {{IPA|/koʊlˈbɛər/}}?" Ed responded "{{IPA|/ˈkoʊlbərt/}}", to which Stephen jokingly replied, "See you in Hell".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cc.com/video-clips/f0688o/the-colbert-report-obama-poster-debate---david-ross-and-ed-colbert|title=Obama Poster Debate&amp;nbsp;– David Ross and Ed Colbert|publisher=[[The Colbert Report]]|date=February 12, 2009|access-date=February 15, 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150914000441/http://www.cc.com/video-clips/f0688o/the-colbert-report-obama-poster-debate---david-ross-and-ed-colbert|archivedate=September 14, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 11, 1974, when Colbert was ten years old, his father and two closest brothers (by age), Peter and Paul, died in the crash of [[Eastern Air Lines Flight 212]] while it was attempting to land in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/stephen-colbert-bio-2015-9/#colbert-was-raised-catholic-to-this-day-he-is-a-dedicated-churchgoer-3|title=How Stephen Colbert endured tragedy and became one of the greatest political satirists of our time|work=Business Insider|access-date=2017-10-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were en route to enroll the two boys at [[Canterbury School (Connecticut)|Canterbury School]] in [[New Milford, Connecticut]].&lt;ref name=25questions/&gt;&lt;ref name="obit"&gt;{{cite news|title=Obituaries|work=The Washington Post|date=September 14, 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lorna Colbert relocated the family downtown to the more urban environment of East Bay Street in [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]]. Colbert found the transition difficult and did not easily make friends in his new neighborhood.&lt;ref name="charlestonian"/&gt; Colbert later described himself during this time as detached, lacking a sense of importance regarding the things with which other children concerned themselves.&lt;ref name="60minutes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ign"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2003/08/11/an-interview-with-stephen-colbert|title=An Interview with Stephen Colbert|first=Ken|last=P.|publisher=IGN|date=August 11, 2003|access-date=July 22, 2006|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140105202148/http://www.ign.com/articles/2003/08/11/an-interview-with-stephen-colbert|archivedate=January 5, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the lack of a significant theater community at Hampden–Sydney, Colbert's interest in acting escalated during this time. After two years, he transferred in 1984 to [[Northwestern University]] as a theater major to study performance, emboldened by the realization that he loved performing, even when no one was coming to shows.&lt;ref name=ign/&gt; He graduated from Northwestern's [[Northwestern University School of Communication|School of Communication]] in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-05-05/news/ct-talk-small-talk-0506-20110505_1_honorary-degree-baby-names-laura-wattenberg|title=Stephen Colbert to receive honorary degree from Northwestern University|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=May 5, 2011|access-date=November 29, 2015|author=Manker, Rob|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208160833/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-05-05/news/ct-talk-small-talk-0506-20110505_1_honorary-degree-baby-names-laura-wattenberg|archivedate=December 8, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career in comedy==
[[File:Time 100 Stephen Colbert and wife.jpg|thumb|Stephen Colbert and his wife Evelyn McGee-Colbert at the 2006 [[Time 100]]]]
While at Northwestern, Colbert studied with the intent of becoming a dramatic actor; mostly he performed in experimental plays and was uninterested in comedy. He began performing improvisation while in college, both in the campus improv team No Fun Mud Piranhas&lt;ref name="northwestern-magazine"&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.northwestern.edu/magazine/winter2010/feature/the-real-stephen-colbert.html|title = The Real Stephen Colbert|work = Northwestern Magazine|access-date = May 1, 2011|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110303031537/http://www.northwestern.edu/magazine/winter2010/feature/the-real-stephen-colbert.html|archivedate = March 3, 2011|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at the [[Annoyance Theatre]] in Chicago as a part of [[Del Close]]'s [[IO Theater|ImprovOlympic]] at a time when the project was focused on competitive, long-form [[improvisation]], rather than improvisational comedy. "I wasn't gonna do [[The Second City|Second City]]", Colbert later recalled, "because those Annoyance people looked down on Second City because they thought it wasn't pure improv&amp;nbsp;– there was a slightly snobby, mystical quality to the Annoyance people".&lt;ref name="avclub"/&gt; After Colbert graduated in 1986, however, he was in need of a job.  A friend who was employed at Second City's box office offered him work answering phones and selling souvenirs.&lt;ref name="ign"/&gt; Colbert accepted and discovered that Second City employees were entitled to take classes at their training center for free.&lt;ref name="avclub"/&gt; Despite his earlier aversion to the comedy group, he signed up for improvisation classes and enjoyed the experience greatly.

Shortly thereafter, he was hired to perform with Second City's touring company, initially as an understudy for [[Steve Carell]]. It was there he met [[Amy Sedaris]] and [[Paul Dinello]], with whom he often collaborated later in his career. By their retelling, the three comedians did not get along at first&amp;nbsp;– Dinello thought Colbert was uptight, pretentious and cold, while Colbert thought of Dinello as "an illiterate thug"&lt;ref name="wiggingout"&gt;{{cite news|title = Wigging Out|first = Darel|last = Jevens|work = [[Chicago Sun-Times]]|date = April 27, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– but the trio became close friends while touring together, discovering that they shared a similar comic sensibility.&lt;ref name="ign"/&gt;

When Sedaris and Dinello were offered the opportunity to create a television series for [[HBO Downtown Productions]], Colbert left The Second City and relocated to New York to work with them on the sketch comedy show ''[[Exit 57]]''.&lt;ref name="ign"/&gt; The series debuted on [[Comedy Central]] in 1995 and aired through 1996. Although it lasted for only 12 episodes, the show received favorable reviews&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Critic's Corner|first = Matt|last = Roush|work = [[USA Today]]|date = August 18, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = The new skitcoms: Sketches of pain|first = David|last = Lipsky|work = Rolling Stone|date = January 21, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was nominated for five [[CableACE Award]]s in 1995, in categories including best writing, performance, and comedy series.&lt;ref name="ccbio"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/the_daily_show/news_team/correspondents/stephen_colbert.jhtml|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20051026174626/http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/the_daily_show/news_team/correspondents/stephen_colbert.jhtml|archivedate = October 26, 2005|title = Biography of Stephen Colbert at ''The Daily Show'' official website|publisher = [[Comedy Central]]|access-date = July 22, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the cancelation of ''Exit 57'', Colbert worked for six months as a cast member and writer on ''[[The Dana Carvey Show]]'', alongside former Second City castmate Steve Carell, and also [[Robert Smigel]], [[Charlie Kaufman]], [[Louis C.K.]], and [[Dino Stamatopoulos]], among others. The series, described by one reviewer as "[[kamikaze]] satire" in "borderline-questionable taste", had sponsors pull out after its first episode aired and was cancelled after seven episodes.&lt;ref name="saloncarvey"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.salon.com/09/reviews/carvey1.html|title = Dana Carvey bites the hand that feeds him|first = Joyce|last = Millman|work = [[Salon (website)|Salon]]|date = February 15, 1996|access-date = November 25, 2006|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061125183623/http://www.salon.com/09/reviews/carvey1.html &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt;|archivedate = November 25, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colbert then worked briefly as a freelance writer for ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' with Robert Smigel. Smigel brought his animated sketch, ''[[The Ambiguously Gay Duo]]'', to ''SNL'' from ''The Dana Carvey Show''; Colbert provided the voice of Ace on both series, opposite Steve Carell as Gary. Needing money, he also worked as a script consultant for [[VH1]] and [[MTV]], before taking a job filming humorous correspondent segments for ''[[Good Morning America]]''.&lt;ref name="ign"/&gt; Only two of the segments he proposed were ever produced and only one aired, but the job led his agent to refer him to ''[[The Daily Show]]'s'' then-producer, [[Madeline Smithberg]], who hired Colbert on a trial basis in 1997.&lt;ref name="mediabistro"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.mediabistro.com/articles/cache/a238.asp|title = So What Do You Do, Stephen Colbert?|first = Jacqueline|last = Schneider|publisher = Mediabistro.com|date = May 6, 2003|access-date = July 22, 2006|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061029204435/https://mediabistro.com/articles/cache/a238.asp|archivedate = October 29, 2006|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Television career==
===''Strangers with Candy''===
{{main|Strangers with Candy}}
During the same period, Colbert worked again with Sedaris and Dinello to develop a new comedy series for Comedy Central, ''[[Strangers with Candy]]''. Comedy Central picked up the series in 1998 after Colbert had already begun working on ''The Daily Show''. As a result, he accepted a reduced role, filming only around 20 ''Daily Show'' segments a year while he worked on the new series.&lt;ref name="ign"/&gt;

''Strangers with Candy'' was conceived of as a parody of [[after school special]]s, following the life of [[List of Strangers with Candy characters#Geraldine "Jerri" Antonia Blank|Jerri Blank]], a 46-year-old [[High school dropouts|dropout]] who returns to finish high school after 32 years of life on the street. Most noted by critics for its use of offensive humor, it concluded each episode by delivering to the audience a skewed, politically incorrect moral lesson.&lt;ref name="tvgswc"&gt;{{cite web|title = Review&amp;nbsp;– Strangers With Candy|first = Ken|last = Fox|work = [[TV Guide]]|url = http://movies.tvguide.com/strangers-candy/review/281396|access-date = July 11, 2007|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120402234730/http://movies.tvguide.com/strangers-candy/review/281396|archivedate = April 2, 2012|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colbert served as a main writer alongside Sedaris and Dinello, and portrayed Jerri's strict but uninformed history teacher, [[List of Strangers with Candy characters#Mr. Charles "Chuck" Noblet|Chuck Noblet]], seen throughout the series dispensing inaccurate information to his classes. Colbert has likened this to the character he played on ''The Daily Show'' and later ''The Colbert Report'', claiming that he has a very specific niche in portraying "poorly informed, high-status idiot" characters.&lt;ref name="25questions"/&gt; Another running joke throughout the series was that Noblet, a [[closeted]] homosexual, was having a "secret" affair with fellow teacher [[List of Strangers with Candy characters#Geoffrey Jellineck|Geoffrey Jellineck]], despite the fact that their relationship was apparent to everyone around them. This obliviousness also appears in Colbert's ''Daily Show'' and ''Colbert Report'' character.

Thirty episodes of ''Strangers with Candy'' were made, which aired on Comedy Central in 1999 and 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.esquire.com/entertainment/tv/interviews/a33697/amy-sedaris-paul-dinello-strangers-with-candy-interview/|title=Amy Sedaris and Paul Dinello on Why 'Strangers with Candy' Should Never Come Back|date=2015-03-17|work=Esquire|access-date=2018-01-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though its ratings were not remarkable during its initial run, it has been characterized as a cult show with a small but dedicated audience.&lt;ref name="ewswc"&gt;{{cite news|title = 50 Best TV Shows on DVD|first = Mandi|last = Bierly|work = [[Entertainment Weekly]]|date = November 26, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colbert reprised his role for a [[Strangers with Candy (film)|film adaptation]], which premiered at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] in 2005 and had a limited release in 2006.

===''The Daily Show''===
{{main|The Daily Show}}
Colbert joined the cast of Comedy Central's parody-news series ''The Daily Show'' in 1997, when the show was in its second season. Originally one of four [[correspondent]]s who filmed segments from remote locations in the style of network news field reporters, Colbert was referred to as "the new guy" on-air for his first two years on the show, during which time [[Craig Kilborn]] served as host. When Kilborn left the show prior to the 1999 season, [[Jon Stewart]] took over hosting duties, also serving as a writer and co-executive producer. From this point, the series gradually began to take on a more political tone and increase in popularity, particularly in the latter part of the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 U.S. presidential election]] season. The roles of the show's correspondents were expanded to include more in-studio segments and international reports, which were almost always done in the studio with the aid of a [[Chroma key|greenscreen]].&lt;ref name="ign"/&gt;

Unlike Stewart, who essentially hosted ''The Daily Show'' as himself,&lt;ref name="baldego"&gt;{{cite news|title = The American Bald Ego|first = James|last = Poniewozik|work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date = November 6, 2005|access-date = October 30, 2006|url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1126747,00.html|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070106223348/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C1126747%2C00.html|archivedate = January 6, 2007|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colbert developed a [[Stephen Colbert (character)|correspondent character]] for his pieces on the series. Colbert has described his correspondent character as "a fool who has spent a lot of his life playing not the fool&amp;nbsp;– one who is able to cover it at least well enough to deal with the subjects that he deals with".&lt;ref name="ign"/&gt; Colbert was frequently pitted against knowledgeable interview subjects, or against Stewart in scripted exchanges, with the resultant dialogue demonstrating the character's lack of knowledge of whatever subject he is discussing.&lt;ref name="steinberg"&gt;Steinberg, Jacques (October 12, 2005).

Colbert commonly hosted "[[This Week in God]]", a report on topics in the news pertaining to religion, presented with the help of the "God Machine". Colbert filed reports from the floor of the [[Democratic National Convention]] and the [[Republican National Convention]] as a part of ''The Daily Show's'' award-winning coverage of the 2000 and [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 U.S. Presidential elections]]; many from the latter were included as part of their ''[[The Daily Show: Indecision 2004]]'' DVD release. Other pieces that have been named as his signature segments include "Grouse Hunting in Shropshire", in which he reported on the "gayness" of British aristocracy, his mock lionization of a smoking-rights activist and apparent chain-smoker, and his cameo appearances during his faux campaign for President.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolph, Ileane (July 27, 2015).

After Colbert left the show, [[Rob Corddry]] took over "This Week in God" segments, although a recorded sample of Colbert's voice is still used as the sound effect for the God Machine.

It was later developed by Stewart's [[Busboy Productions]] and pitched to [[Comedy Central]], which [[green-light]]ed the program; Comedy Central had already been searching for a way to extend the successful ''Daily Show'' franchise beyond a half-hour.&lt;ref name="medialife"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.medialifemagazine.com/the-wit-and-sense-of-colbert-report/|title = The wit and sense of 'Colbert Report'|publisher = Media Life|first = Toni|last = Fitzgerald|date = October 20, 2005|access-date = July 11, 2007|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130607105808/http://www.medialifemagazine.com/the-wit-and-sense-of-colbert-report/|archivedate = June 7, 2013|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series opened to strong ratings, averaging 1.2&amp;nbsp;million viewers nightly during its first week on the air.

Much of Colbert's personal life was reflected in his character on ''The Colbert Report''. With the extended exposure of the character on the show, he often referenced his interest in and knowledge of Catholicism, science fiction, and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', as well as using real facts to create his character's history. His alternate persona was also raised in [[South Carolina]], is the youngest of 11 siblings and is married.&lt;ref name="Colbertnation"&gt;{{cite web|last=Gordon|first=Avery|title=Stephen's bio from Colbertnation.com|url=http://www.colbertnation.com/cn/stephens-bio.php|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080325224351/http://www.colbertnation.com/cn/stephens-bio.php|archivedate=March 25, 2008|publisher = [[Comedy Central]]|access-date =June 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actual Colbert's career history in acting and comedy, however, was often downplayed or even denied outright, and he frequently referred to having attended [[Dartmouth College]] (which was at the forefront of the conservative campus movement in the 1980s) rather than his actual alma mater, Northwestern. In July 2012, Colbert added two years to his contract with Comedy Central, extending the run of ''The Colbert Report'' until the end of 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/25/stewart-and-colbert-extend-comedy-central-contracts/ |title=Stewart and Colbert Extend Comedy Central Contracts |work=The New York Times |first=Bill |last=Carter |date=July 25, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120726013145/http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/25/stewart-and-colbert-extend-comedy-central-contracts/ |archivedate=July 26, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under his fictional persona in ''The Colbert Report'', Colbert dropped hints of a potential presidential run throughout 2007, with speculation intensifying following the release of his book, ''I Am America (And So Can You!)'', which was rumored to be a sign that he was indeed testing the waters for a future bid for the White House. On October 16, 2007, he announced his candidacy on his show, stating his intention to run both on the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] platforms, but only as a "[[favorite son]]" in his native South Carolina.&lt;ref name="Presidential bid"&gt;{{cite news|url = http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hFzxF7XLwi7Il2DVEE6la0NVo--gD8SB07VO0|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071019004644/http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hFzxF7XLwi7Il2DVEE6la0NVo--gD8SB07VO0|archivedate = October 19, 2007|title = Colbert Announces Presidential Pursuit|agency = Associated Press|date = October 17, 2007|access-date =October 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later abandoned plans to run as a Republican due to the $35,000 fee required to file for the South Carolina primary;&lt;ref name="dysfunction"&gt;Starr, Michael (October 18, 2007).

After announcing his presidential ticket, he asked his viewers to cast their votes by donating to [[Donorschoose.org]], an online charity connecting individuals to classrooms in need.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://gawker.com/313049/stephen-colbert-thanks-craig-newmark-for-killing-the-american-newspaper |title=Stephen Colbert thanks Craig Newmark for killing the American newspaper |publisher=Gawker |date=October 19, 2007 |access-date=January 29, 2015 |author=Faulkner, Tim |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303220833/http://gawker.com/313049/stephen-colbert-thanks-craig-newmark-for-killing-the-american-newspaper |archivedate=March 3, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colbert teamed up with [[Donorschoose.org]] again in 2008 by asking supporters of [[Barack Obama]] and [[Hillary Clinton]] to do the same. As a lead-up to the Pennsylvania primary, he created a "straw poll that makes a difference" by which people could donate to Pennsylvania classroom projects in honor of their favorite candidate.&lt;ref name="children"&gt;{{cite web|title = Children's Drawings|date = April 8, 2008|url = http://www.cc.com/video-clips/g0ke6u/the-colbert-report-children-s-drawings|postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170214183448/http://www.cc.com/video-clips/g0ke6u/the-colbert-report-children-s-drawings|archivedate = February 14, 2017|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 1, 2007, the South Carolina Democratic Party executive council voted 13–3 to refuse Colbert's application onto the ballot.

Though Colbert's real-life presidential campaign had ended, [[Marvel Comics]] editor-in-chief [[Joe Quesada]] established in an interview on ''The Colbert Report'' that Colbert's campaign was still going strong in the fictional [[Marvel Universe]], citing the cover art of a then-recent issue of ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' which featured a Colbert campaign billboard in the background. Background appearances of Colbert campaign ads continued to appear in Marvel Comics publications, as late as August 2008's ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' No. 5 (which also features a [[cameo appearance|cameo]] of an alien [[Skrull]] posing as Colbert). In October 2008, Colbert made an extended 8-page appearance webslinging with Spider-Man in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' issue No. 573.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Los Angeles Times|title=Stephen Colbert is a swinger for Marvel|date=September 29, 2008|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/herocomplex/2008/09/stephen-colbert.html|first=Geoff|last=Boucher|access-date=April 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colbert voiced the president of the U.S. in the 2009 film ''[[Monsters vs. Aliens]]''.

[[File:Operation Iraqi Stephen DVIDS178745.jpg|thumb|Stephen Colbert greets troops and civilians at [[Al Faw Palace]] at [[Camp Victory]] in Baghdad, Iraq, June 5, as part of his "Operation Iraqi Stephen: Going Commando" tour]]

Stephen Colbert arrived in [[Baghdad, Iraq]], on June 5, 2009, to film a week of shows called "Operation Iraqi Stephen: [[Going Commando]]" sponsored by the [[USO]] (United Service Organizations).&lt;ref name="USOIraq"&gt;{{cite news |title=Bob Hope's Spirit, but No Cheesecake |author=Alessandra Stanley |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/12/arts/television/12watch.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=June 11, 2009 |access-date=August 27, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215094416/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/12/arts/television/12watch.html |archivedate=February 15, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Colbert had a suit tailored for him in the [[Army Combat Uniform]] pattern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Colbert Goes Commando in Iraq |author=Lee Farran |url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=7781207&amp;page=1 |work=ABC News |date=June 8, 2009 |access-date=August 27, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110618063149/http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=7781207&amp;page=1 |archivedate=June 18, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the first episode (which featured a cameo appearance from U.S. president [[Barack Obama]]), Colbert had his hair cropped in a military style to show his solidarity with the troops.

===2010 Congressional testimony===
On September 24, 2010, Colbert testified in character before the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, Citizenship, and Border Security.

On September 16, 2010, Stewart and Colbert announced competing rallies on the Washington, D.C., Mall on October 30, 2010, Stewart's "''Rally to Restore Sanity''", and Colbert's "''March to Keep Fear Alive''". Both were eventually merged into the [[Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear]].

===Super PAC and President of the United States of South Carolina===
{{main|Colbert Super PAC}}
{{See also|South Carolina Republican primary, 2012}}

In May 2011, Colbert filed a request with the [[Federal Election Commission]] (FEC) asking for a media exemption for coverage of his [[political action committee]], ColbertPAC, on ''The Colbert Report''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Knott|first=Alex|title=Stephen Colbert Files FEC Request for Colbert PAC|type=video|url=http://www.rollcall.com/news/Stephen-Colbert-PAC-FEC-video-205563-1.html|newspaper=Roll Call|date=May 12, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514180956/http://www.rollcall.com/news/Stephen-Colbert-PAC-FEC-video-205563-1.html|archivedate=May 14, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Vogel|first=Kenneth P.|title=Stephen Colbert at the FEC?

In June 2011, during a public meeting, the [[Federal Election Commission|FEC]] voted 5–1 to grant ''The Colbert Report'' a limited media exemption. The exemption allows unlimited donations of airtime and show resources to promote the Colbert Super PAC without requiring disclosure to the FEC, but only for ads appearing on ''The Colbert Report''. Following the hearing, Colbert formally filed paperwork for the creation of his [[Super PAC]] with the FEC secretary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Shear| first = Michael| title = Colbert Gets Permission to Form Super-PAC| url = http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/30/colbert-gets-permission-to-form-super-pac/| work = The New York Times| date = June 30, 2011| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110701035828/http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/30/colbert-gets-permission-to-form-super-pac/| archivedate = July 1, 2011| df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 2012 New Hampshire primary, a poll for the subsequent South Carolina primary taken by Public Policy Polling (of 1,112 likely GOP voters, Jan 5–7, 2012) was reported to place Colbert at 5%, one point ahead of Jon Huntsman polling at 4%, in spite of the fact that Colbert was not on the ballot. This poll showed Colbert to be closely behind Rick Perry's 7% and Ron Paul's 8% (with Romney at 27%, Gingrich 23% and Santorum at 18%). On the January 11 episode of ''The Colbert Report'', Colbert asked his audience if he should run for President in South Carolina, to which he received strong applause. He then stated that he would be making a "Major Announcement" during the next day's show. On January 12, Colbert started his show by discussing his role in the Presidential campaign, then addressed the law preventing him from being a Presidential candidate while running his Super PAC. With the help of his lawyer Trevor Potter, he then signed over control of his Super PAC to Jon Stewart, with the organization title then being referred to as "The Definitely Not Coordinating With Stephen Colbert Super PAC".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.colbertsuperpac.com/ |title= Under New Management! |publisher= Colbert Super PAC |access-date= May 2, 2012 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120430074528/http://www.colbertsuperpac.com/ |archivedate= April 30, 2012 |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately after this legal block was out of the way, Colbert announced, "I am forming an exploratory committee to lay the groundwork for my possible candidacy for the President of the United States of South Carolina. I'm doin' it!" He reiterated in the interview portion of that show that "I'm still in the exploratory phase" of his Presidential campaign.

On the January 16, 2012, episode, Colbert satirically encouraged his viewers to vote for [[Herman Cain]] in the South Carolina primary. As Cain was still on the ballot, despite having recently dropped out of the race, Colbert announced that he would consider any votes cast for Cain to be in direct support of his own possible candidacy.

==Other work==
Colbert is co-author of the satirical text-and-picture novel ''[[Wigfield|Wigfield: The Can Do Town That Just May Not]]'', which was published in 2003 by [[Hyperion (publisher)|Hyperion Books]]. The novel was a collaboration between Colbert, [[Amy Sedaris]], and [[Paul Dinello]], and tells the story of a small town threatened by the impending destruction of a massive dam. The narrative is presented as a series of fictional interviews with the town's residents, accompanied by photos. The three authors toured performing an adaptation of ''Wigfield'' on stage the same year the book was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = 'Daily Show' meets Second City in 'Wigfield' tour|first = Nina|last = Metz|work = Chicago Tribune|date = April 27, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/article/wigfield-stars-amy-sedaris-stephen-colbert-and-paul-dinello-at-nycs-jane-street-may-9-17-com-113082|title=Wigfield Stars Amy Sedaris, Stephen Colbert and Paul Dinello at NYC's Jane Street, May 9–17 {{!}} Playbill|website=Playbill|language=en|access-date=2018-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He voiced the characters of Reducto and Phil Ken Sebben in the [[Adult Swim]]'s ''[[Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law]]'', but left the show in 2005 to work on ''The Colbert Report''. His characters were both killed, though he returned to voice Phil for the series finale. Colbert also has provided voices for Cartoon Network's ''[[The Venture Bros.]]'', Comedy Central's ''[[Crank Yankers]]'', and ''[[American Dad!]]'', and for Canadian animated comedy series ''[[The Wrong Coast]]''.

[[File:Stephen Colbert 4 by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|right|Colbert at the launch of his show's book, ''[[I Am America (And So Can You!)]]'']]
Colbert filled in for Sam Seder on the second episode of ''[[The Majority Report]]'' on [[Air America Radio]], and has also done reports for ''[[The Al Franken Show]]''. He appeared on a track on ''[[Wig in a Box]]'', a tribute album for ''[[Hedwig and the Angry Inch (musical)|Hedwig and the Angry Inch]]''. Colbert read the part of [[Leopold Bloom]] in ''Bloomsday on Broadway XXIV: Love Literature Language Lust: Leopold's Women Bloom'' on June 16, 2005, at Symphony Space in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://beta.prx.org/stories/5018|title=Bloomsday on Broadway XXIV - Leopold's Women Bloom|date=August 24, 2009|access-date=May 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He appeared in a series of TV commercials for [[General Motors]], as a not-too-bright investigator searching for the elusive (and non-existent in real life) "[[GM Goodwrench|Mr. Goodwrench]]". He also portrayed the letter Z in ''[[Sesame Street]]: All-Star Alphabet'', a 2005 video release.

Colbert is a producer of ''[[The 1 Second Film]]'', the world's largest nonprofit collaborative art film. His video request that [[IMDb]] list his credit for ''The 1 Second Film'' ("it is as valid as most of my credits") enabled thousands of the film's producers to be listed in the massive movie database until they were removed in early 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.the1secondfilm.com/blog/nirvan/why_did_imdb_remove_thousands_our_producers |title=Why did IMDb remove thousands of our producers? {{!}} The 1 Second Film |author=Mullick, Nirvan |date=February 5, 2007 |access-date=August 5, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719014331/http://www.the1secondfilm.com/blog/nirvan/why_did_imdb_remove_thousands_our_producers |archivedate=July 19, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colbert has released one book associated with ''The Colbert Report'', ''[[I Am America (And So Can You!)]]''. It was released on October 7, 2007, by [[Hachette Book Group USA|Grand Central Publishing]]. Grand Central Publishing is the successor to Warner Books, which published ''[[America (The Book)]]'', written by ''The Daily Show'' staff.

===COLBERT Treadmill===
{{Main|Treadmill with Vibration Isolation Stabilization}}
{{Wikinews|Comedian Stephen Colbert wins NASA space station name contest}}
In 2009, NASA engineered a new treadmill for the [[International Space Station]]. It was brought to the ISS by the [[Space Shuttle Discovery|Space Shuttle ''Discovery'']] during the STS-128 mission in August 2009. The complex machine is now used eight hours daily by astronauts and cosmonauts aboard the space station in order to maintain their muscle mass and bone density while spending long periods of time in a zero-gravity environment. While engineers at NASA were constructing this treadmill, it was simply called T-2 for more than two years. However, on April 14, 2009, NASA renamed it the "Combined Operational Load-Bearing External Resistance Treadmill", or COLBERT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/behindscenes/colberttreadmill.html|title=NASA&amp;nbsp;– COLBERT Ready for Serious Exercise|publisher=Nasa.gov|date=October 23, 2010|access-date=July 16, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604060728/http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/behindscenes/colberttreadmill.html|archivedate=June 4, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; NASA named the treadmill after Colbert,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29841715/|title=Oops: Colbert wins space station name contest – Technology &amp; science – Space – Human spaceflight|publisher=MSNBC|date=March 23, 2009|access-date=July 16, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604044323/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29841715/|archivedate=June 4, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; who took an interest during the Node 3 naming census for the ISS module, [[Tranquility (ISS module)|''Tranquility'']].

Colbert urged his followers to post the name "Colbert", which upon completion of the census received the most entries totaling 230,539, some 40,000 votes more than the second-place choice, Serenity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cc.com/video-clips/l9p0ah/the-colbert-report-space-module--colbert---name-nasa-s-node-3-after-stephen|title=Name the NASA Module After Stephen|publisher=colbertnation.com|date=March 3, 2008|access-date=March 4, 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170214181941/http://www.cc.com/video-clips/l9p0ah/the-colbert-report-space-module--colbert---name-nasa-s-node-3-after-stephen|archivedate=February 14, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The COLBERT is expected to last the life of the ISS and will have seen about 38,000 miles of running when the Space Station is retired in 2020 but was also built with 150,000-mile lifespan if needed till 2028 or longer. Colbert realized he was the recipient of an extremely rare honor when astronaut [[Suni Williams]] came on ''The Colbert Report'' to announce that NASA had named the treadmill after him. Despite being a [[backronym]], the COLBERT is the only piece of NASA-engineered equipment in space that is named after a living human being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/externalflash/name_ISS/index.html|title=Help NASA Name Node 3!|publisher=Nasa.gov|date=January 30, 2009|access-date=July 16, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110703150517/http://www.nasa.gov/externalflash/name_ISS/index.html|archivedate=July 3, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
