In Episode 4.3 of the MTV show ''[[Punk'd]]'', which aired on March 20, 2005, Braff was filmed yelling at a teenaged actor. He unwittingly appeared on the show at the behest of his ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]'' co-star, [[Donald Faison]], who pranked Braff by having an actor spray-paint Braff's new [[Porsche]] with fake paint. Braff pursued and caught the teen actor and tried to punch him in the stomach; this was edited out of the episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Van Luling|first1=Todd|title=The Wild And Sometimes Frightening World Of ‘Punk’d’|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/punkd_us_5873e3bce4b099cdb0fed2d4|website=Huffington Post|accessdate=10 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hollywood.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywood.com/news/tv/3553284/zach-braff-busted-beating-up-teen-on-punk-d?page=all |title=Zach Braff Busted Beating Up Teen on 'Punk'd' |date=September 14, 2006 |accessdate=September 26, 2014 |publisher=Hollywood.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029030729/http://www.hollywood.com/news/tv/3553284/zach-braff-busted-beating-up-teen-on-punk-d?page=all |archivedate=October 29, 2014 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ktdm5/i_ama_zach_braff/c2n22qh|title=I AMA Zach Braff. • /r/IAmA|website=reddit|access-date=2016-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2008, Braff earned his pilot's license flying a [[Cirrus SR20]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bestlifeonline.com/cms/publish/leisure/Zach-Braff-s-love-of-flying.php |title=Zach Braff's love of flying|publisher=Bestlifeonline.com |accessdate=April 5, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100206034639/http://bestlifeonline.com/cms/publish/leisure/Zach-Braff-s-love-of-flying.php|archivedate=February 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political views==
Braff, a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], endorsed [[Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2012|the re-election campaign]] of [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]].&lt;ref name="lvrj"&gt;{{cite news|work=Las Vegas Review Journal|first=Laura|last=Myers|title='Scrubs' stars hit Las Vegas to register voters|date=July 28, 2012|accessdate=July 31, 2012|url=http://www.lvrj.com/news/-scrubs-stars-hit-vegas-to-register-voters-164157116.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He has accused [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] politicians of lying, saying "What is frustrating is the lying. I know every politician spins the truth a little, but when you happen to know the facts and you see [[Paul Ryan]]'s speech you are like 'Wait a minute. So much of that is not true."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/washington-whispers/2012/09/06/zach-braff-fed-up-with-republican-lies|title=Zach Braff Fed Up With Republican 'Lies'|last=Fox|first=Lauren|date=2012|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
