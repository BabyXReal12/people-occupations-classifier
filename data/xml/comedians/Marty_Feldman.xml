He was the first [[Saturn Award]] winner for [[Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for his role in ''[[Young Frankenstein]]''.

== Early life ==
Feldman was born on 8 July 1934 in the [[East End of London]], the son of Jewish immigrants from [[Kiev]], [[Ukraine]], Cecilia (née Crook) and Myer Feldman, a gown manufacturer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/2002/08/04/2002-08-04_movie_memory_marty_feldman_1.html |title=Movie Memory: Marty Feldman 1977 |newspaper=New York Daily News |date=4 August 2002 |accessdate=30 August 2009 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;{{cite book| url=http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/59533 |title=Feldman, Martin Alan [Marty] (1934–1982), comedian and scriptwriter |first=Barry |last=Took |work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |date=September 2004 |isbn=978-0-19-861412-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; He recalled his childhood as "solitary".&lt;ref name="six"&gt;{{cite web |title=Marty Feldman: Six Degrees of Separation |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b009pgsc |work=[[BBC Two]] |date=13 August 2011 |accessdate=18 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feldman suffered from [[thyroid]] disease and developed [[Graves' ophthalmopathy]], causing his eyes to [[exophthalmos|protrude]] and become [[strabismus|misaligned]]. A childhood injury, a car crash, a boating accident, and reconstructive eye surgery may also have contributed to his appearance.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/03/070301081947.htm|title=Why Graves' Disease Attacks The Eyes: Study Uncovers Clues|website=Sciencedaily.com|accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/event/article-3295203/Marty-Feldman-looks-comic-equipment-right-packaging-job.html|title=Marty Feldman: My looks are my comic equipment|website=Dailymail.co.uk|accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="amc.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5n5KnItC9YEC&amp;lpg=PA105&amp;ots=0mJY6IpQk_&amp;dq=marty+feldman+eyes+surgery&amp;pg=PA105#v=onepage&amp;q=marty+feldman+eyes+surgery&amp;f=false|title=The Encyclopedia of Endocrine Diseases and Disorders|first1=William A.|last1=Petit|first2=William|last2=Petit|first3=Christine A.|last3=Adamec|date=5 July 2018|publisher=Infobase Publishing|accessdate=5 July 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.thyroid.ca/e3c.php |title=Archived copy |access-date=2 May 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170809130354/http://www.thyroid.ca/e3c.php |archive-date=9 August 2017 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theofficialmartyfeldman.com/main/news/the-unorthodox-comedian-marty-feldman/|title=The Unorthodox Comedian - The Official Marty Feldman website!|date=4 January 2016|website=Theofficialmartyfeldman.com|accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="six" /&gt; Leaving school at 15, he worked at the [[Dreamland Margate|Dreamland]] [[funfair]] in [[Margate]],&lt;ref name="six" /&gt; but had dreams of a career as a jazz trumpeter, and performed in the first group in which tenor saxophonist [[Tubby Hayes]] was a member.&lt;ref name="Chilton"&gt;{{cite news |first=Martin |last=Chilton |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bookreviews/8894915/Marty-Feldman-The-Biography-Of-A-Comedy-Legend-by-Robert-Ross-review.html |title=Marty Feldman – The Biography Of A Comedy Legend by Robert Ross: review |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=17 November 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151119071340/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bookreviews/8894915/Marty-Feldman-The-Biography-Of-A-Comedy-Legend-by-Robert-Ross-review.html |archivedate=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feldman joked that he was "the world's worst [[trumpet]] player."&lt;ref name="Chilton" /&gt; By the age of 20 he had decided to pursue a career as a [[comedian]].

== Early career ==
Although his early performing career was undistinguished, he became part of a comedy act—Morris, Marty, and Mitch—that made its first television appearance on the BBC series ''Showcase'' in April 1955.&lt;ref name="Oliver" /&gt; Later in the decade, Feldman worked on the scripts for ''[[Educating Archie]]'' in both its radio and television incarnations with [[Chesney and Wolfe|Ronald Chesney]] and, later, Ronald Wolfe.

In 1954, Feldman first met [[Barry Took]] while both were working as performers, and with Took he  eventually formed an enduring writing partnership which lasted until 1974.&lt;ref name="Oliver" /&gt; They wrote a few episodes of  ''[[The Army Game]]'' (1960) and the bulk of ''[[Bootsie and Snudge]]'' (1960–62), both situation comedies made by [[Granada Television]] for the ITV network. For BBC radio they wrote ''[[Round the Horne]]'' (1964–67), their best-remembered comedy series, which starred [[Kenneth Horne]] and [[Kenneth Williams]].&lt;ref name="six" /&gt; (The last season of ''Round the Horne'' in 1968 was written by others.) This work placed Feldman and Took "in the front rank of comedy writers," according to [[Denis Norden]].&lt;ref name="six" /&gt;

Feldman then became the chief writer and script editor on ''[[The Frost Report]]'' (1966–67). He co-wrote the much-shown "[[Class sketch|Class]]" sketch with John Law, in which [[John Cleese]], [[Ronnie Barker]], and [[Ronnie Corbett]] faced the audience, with their descending order of height, suggesting their relative social status as upper class (Cleese), middle class (Barker), and working class (Corbett).&lt;ref name="six" /&gt;

The television [[sketch comedy]] series ''[[At Last the 1948 Show]]'' raised Feldman's profile as a performer. The other three participants, (future [[Monty Python|Pythons]], [[Graham Chapman]] and John Cleese, and future [[The Goodies|Goody]], [[Tim Brooke-Taylor]]) needed a fourth cast member and had Feldman in mind.&lt;ref name="six" /&gt; In a sketch on 1 March 1967, Feldman's character harassed a patient shop assistant (played by Cleese) regarding a series of fictitious books, achieving success with ''Ethel the Aardvark Goes Quantity Surveying''. His character in ''At Last the 1948 Show'' was often called Mr Pest, according to John Cleese.&lt;ref&gt;[[BBC Radio 2]] programme ''East End Boys'', 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Feldman was co-author, along with Cleese, Chapman, and Brooke-Taylor of the [[Four Yorkshiremen sketch|"Four Yorkshiremen" sketch]], which was written for ''At Last the 1948 Show''.&lt;ref name="six" /&gt;

Feldman was given his own series on the [[BBC]] called ''[[Marty (TV series)|Marty]]'' in 1968;&lt;ref name="six" /&gt; it featured Brooke-Taylor, [[John Junkin]], and [[Roland MacLeod]], with Cleese as one of the writers.&lt;ref name="six" /&gt; Feldman won two [[BAFTA]] awards. The second series in 1969 was renamed ''It's Marty'' (the second title being retained for the DVD of the show)

== After 1970 ==
[[File:Marty Feldman 1972.JPG|thumb|250px|Promotional photo for ''[[The Marty Feldman Comedy Machine]]'', 1972]]
In 1971, Feldman gave evidence in favour of the defendants in the [[OZ (magazine)#UK obscenity trial and appeal|''OZ'' trial]].&lt;ref name="six" /&gt; He would not swear on the Bible, choosing instead to affirm.&lt;ref name="six" /&gt; Throughout his testimony, he mocked the judge after it was implied that he had no religion because he was not Christian.&lt;ref name="six" /&gt; By this time, ''[[The Marty Feldman Comedy Machine]]'' (1971–1972) was in preparation, a TV series co-produced by [[Associated Television]] (ATV) and the [[American Broadcasting Company]] which was produced at ATV's [[BBC Elstree Centre|Elstree Studios]], near London. This show lasted for one season.&lt;!-- See talk. --&gt;

In 1974, [[Dennis Main Wilson]] produced a short BBC sketch series for Feldman titled ''Marty Back Together Again''&amp;nbsp;— a reference to reports about the star's health&amp;nbsp;— but it never captured the impact of the earlier series. The ''Marty'' series proved popular enough with an international audience (the first series won the Golden Rose Award at Montreux) to launch a film career. His first feature role was in ''Every Home Should Have One'' (1970).&lt;ref name="six" /&gt; Feldman spent time in [[Soho]] [[jazz]] clubs, as he found a parallel between "riffing" in a comedy partnership and the improvisation of jazz.&lt;ref name="six" /&gt;

On film, in [[Mel Brooks]]' ''[[Young Frankenstein]]'' (1974), he was Igor (pronounced "EYE-gore", a comic response to Wilder's claim that "it's pronounced FRONK-EN-SCHTEEN"). Many lines in ''Young Frankenstein'' were improvised. [[Gene Wilder]] says he had Feldman in mind when he wrote the part.&lt;ref name="six" /&gt; At one point, Dr Frankenstein (Wilder) scolds Igor with the phrase, "Damn your eyes!" Feldman turns to the camera, points to his misaligned eyes with a grin and says, "Too late!"

Feldman's performances on American television included ''[[The Dean Martin Show]]''.

In 1976, Feldman ventured into [[Cinema of Italy|Italian cinema]], starring with [[Barbara Bouchet]] in ''40 gradi all'ombra del lenzuolo'' ''([[Sex with a Smile]]''), a [[sex comedy]]. He appeared in ''[[The Adventure of Sherlock Holmes' Smarter Brother]]'' and Brooks' ''[[Silent Movie]]'', as well as directing and starring in ''[[The Last Remake of Beau Geste]]''. He guest-starred in the "Arabian Nights" episode of ''[[The Muppet Show]]'' with several ''[[Sesame Street]]'' characters, especially [[Cookie Monster]] with whom he shared a playful cameo comparing their eyes side by side.

During the course of his career, Feldman recorded one [[LP record]], ''I Feel a Song Going Off'' (1969), re-released as ''The Crazy World of Marty Feldman''. The songs were written by [[Denis King]], John Junkin, and Bill Solly (a writer for [[Max Bygraves]] and ''[[The Two Ronnies]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.thekettering.co.uk/?p=53 |title=Marty - The Whowrotewhat Wotnot (series 1) |journal=The Kettering |issue=4 |date= |accessdate=30 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was re-released as a [[Compact disc|CD]] in 2007.

== Personal life ==
Feldman was married to Lauretta Sullivan (29 September 1935&amp;nbsp;– 12 March 2010) from January 1959 until his death in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nndb.com/people/623/000043494/ |title=Marty Feldman |website=[[NNDB]] |access-date=18 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She died, aged 74, in [[Studio City, Los Angeles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/latimes/obituary.aspx?pid=141834867 |title=Lauretta Sullivan Feldman |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=15 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feldman's peers have reported, in a number of biographies, that he was highly attractive to women in spite of his unconventional facial appearance.&lt;ref name="Ross2011"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qne_BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT252 |title=Marty Feldman: The Biography of a Comedy Legend |date=25 October 2011 |publisher=Titan Books |isbn=978-0-85768-602-2 |page=252 |first=Robert |last=Ross}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His younger sister, Pamela,&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt; who no longer uses her family name, lives in the Tereken district of the Belgian town of [[Sint-Niklaas]].{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Politically, Marty Feldman has been described as an "avowed [[socialism|socialist]]"&lt;ref name=current/&gt; telling one interviewer "I'm a socialist by conviction, if not by lifestyle"&lt;ref&gt;"Feldman has 'ideal equipment'", ''The Pittsburgh Press'', January 11, 1976&lt;/ref&gt; and another "I'm a socialist from way back, but in order to pay my back taxes I have to live in America to earn enough money to pay the back tax I owe to the socialist government that I voted in."&lt;ref name="six"/&gt; He joked later that when a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] cabinet minister said to him "Of course you vote Labour," Feldman replied, "No, I don't, because I'm a socialist!"&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=9j04CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT535&amp;lpg=PT535&amp;dq=%22I%27m+a+socialist%22+marty+feldman&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Qc_gIUsae3&amp;sig=-4E07OZBPWyJzUZiXtF-QgHYJAA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiR_eX3hITPAhUJJR4KHYXUCnkQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22I'm%20a%20socialist%22%20marty%20feldman&amp;f=false Marty Feldman: The Biography of a Comedy Legend]'' by Robert Ross, chapter 15, footnote 17&lt;/ref&gt; However, he generally did not seriously discuss politics in public. An exception was when during a promotional tour for ''The Last Remake of Beau Geste'' he denounced [[Anita Bryant]]'s campaign against [[homosexuality]].&lt;ref name=current&gt;[http://jewishcurrents.org/marty-feldman-versus-the-suits-42434 "Marty Feldman versus the Suits]" by Mike Kuhlenbeck, ''Jewish Currents'', June 29, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death ==
Feldman died from a heart attack in a hotel room in [[Mexico City]] on 2 December 1982 at age 48, during the making of the film ''[[Yellowbeard]]''. On the DVD commentary of ''Young Frankenstein,'' Mel Brooks cites factors that may have contributed to Feldman's death: "He smoked sometimes half a carton (5 packs) of cigarettes daily, drank copious amounts of black coffee, and ate a diet rich in eggs and dairy products."{{cn|date=March 2018}}
