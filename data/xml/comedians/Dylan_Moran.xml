'''Dylan William Moran''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɔər|ən}}; born 3 November 1971)&lt;ref name="Meath County Council"&gt;{{cite web|author=Meath County Council |url=http://www.meath.ie/Tourism/DiscoverBoyneValley/FamousMeathPeople/DylanMoran/|title="Dylan Moran Comedian/Actor"}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[Irish people|Irish]] comedian, writer, actor, filmmaker and artist. He is best known for his [[observational comedy]], the television sitcom ''[[Black Books]]'' (in which he starred and co-wrote) and his work with [[Simon Pegg]] in ''[[Shaun of the Dead]]'' and ''[[Run Fatboy Run]]''. He appeared as one of the two lead characters in the Irish [[black comedy]] titled ''[[A Film with Me in It]]'' in 2008.

Moran's most recent film is ''[[Calvary (2014 film)|Calvary]]'', an Irish black comedy drama film written and directed by [[John Michael McDonagh]]. Moran is a regular performer at national and international comedy festivals including the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]], [[Just for Laughs]] Montreal Comedy Festival, the [[Melbourne International Comedy Festival]] and the [[Kilkenny Comedy Festival]]. In 2007, Moran was voted the 17th greatest stand-up comic on [[Channel 4]]'s 100 Greatest Stand-Ups and again in the updated 2010 list as the 14th greatest stand-up comic. He lives in [[Edinburgh]] with his wife, Elaine, and two children.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Moran was born in [[Navan]], [[County Meath]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]].&lt;ref name="Meath County Council"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=IMDB |url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0602836/|title="Dylan Moran IMDB"}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The Irish Times |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/blogs/generationemigration/2013/12/04/irishman-abroad-episode-13-dylan-moran/|title="‘Irishman Abroad’ episode 13: Dylan Moran"}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=HotPress Magazine |url=http://www.hotpress.com/features/interviews/Did-You-Hear-The-One-About-The-Irishman-Who---/392489.html|title="Did You Hear The One About The Irishman Who was born in Navan"}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[St. Patrick's Classical School]], where he experimented early on with standup, with fellow comics [[Tommy Tiernan]] and [[Hector Ó hEochagáin]], and left at age 16&lt;ref name="Maxwell Times"&gt;{{cite news|first=Dominic|last=Maxwell|title= Bye bye Bernard|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/whats_on/listings/article706708.ece|work=[[The Times]]|date=22 April 2006|accessdate=26 July 2007 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; with his [[Irish Leaving Certificate|Leaving Certificate]]. After leaving school, it has been said that Moran spent four years unemployed "drinking and writing bad poetry".&lt;ref name="Kelner BBC"&gt;{{cite news|first= Martin|last= Kelner|title= People have told me I'm grumpy|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bradford/stage/2005/06/dylan_moran_interview.shtml|work=BBC Bradford and West Yorkshire|date=June 2005|accessdate=26 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; At one point, Moran worked as a florist but quit after a week because he hated the job.&lt;ref name="Kelner BBC"/&gt;

===Career===

Dylan Moran came to comedy at age 20 after watching [[Ardal O'Hanlon]] and other comedians perform at Dublin's [[International Comedy Cellar|Comedy Cellar]], a small fifty-seater comedy club with no microphone in the basement of The International Bar on South Wicklow Street. He began his stand up there in 1992 and, although nervous, got a good reception.&lt;ref name="Maxwell Times"/&gt; In 1993, he won the [[So You Think You're Funny]] award at the [[Edinburgh Festival]]. He went on to become the youngest person to win the [[Perrier Comedy Award]] in 1996 at the Edinburgh Festival at age 24.&lt;ref name="Kelner BBC"/&gt; ''Gurgling For Money'' was Moran's first major one man stand up UK tour in 1997. He went on to perform at many other festivals including the [[Hay Festival]], [[Just for laughs|Montreal comedy festival]], Vancouver Comedy Festival and the Edinburgh Festival. Between 1995 and 1997 Moran wrote a weekly column for ''[[The Irish Times]]''.

Moran won his first major television role in 1998 playing Ian Lyons in the [[BBC 2]] sitcom ''[[How Do You Want Me?]]'', with [[Charlotte Coleman]].&lt;ref name="Maxwell Times"/&gt; He went on to appear in a small role in the 1999 movie ''[[Notting Hill (film)|Notting Hill]]'' as Rufus the thief. In 2000, ''[[Black Books]]'' was launched on [[Channel 4]]. The sitcom, about a depressed, bitter, alcoholic, chain-smoking, and misanthropic book shop owner, [[Bernard Black]], was based on a dream Moran had in the mid eighties during a weekend away in Limerick{{Citation needed|reason=No current citation to confirm this, and in an article on the Channel 4 website Moran is quoted as saying "I don’t remember where the idea came from"|date=August 2018}}. It was brought into existence with the aid of co-writer and fellow Irishman [[Graham Linehan]], and producers Mark Buckley and Albert Kenny of Kenley Studios. The second series was televised in 2002, and the third, which aired in 2004, was greeted with great enthusiasm by critics and fans alike.&lt;ref name="Maxwell Times"/&gt; In the same year Moran appeared in his first major film role playing David in the horror comedy, ''[[Shaun of the Dead]]''.

Moran toured his new shows ''Monster I'' and ''Monster II'' in 2004, including performances in New York and [[Milan]], as well as a tour across Britain and Ireland, culminating in a week-long run at London's [[Palace Theatre, London|Palace Theatre]], before two shows at Dublin's [[Vicar Street]], and finally an appearance at the [[Hay Festival]]. The tour was described by ''The Times'' as a "masterclass of comic charisma: swinging from topic to topic in a manner seemingly spontaneous but actually tightly organised".&lt;ref name="Maxwell Times"/&gt;

A live DVD of the ''Monster II'' tour, filmed on 28 May at Dublin's Vicar Street, was released that year, as Moran's first live stand-up DVD. After a successful run in [[New York City]] in 2004 as part of the British/Irish Comedy Invasion (including performances by top British and Irish comedians such as [[Eddie Izzard]], fellow ''Black Books'' star [[Bill Bailey]] and Irish comedian [[Tommy Tiernan]]) Moran returned to New York for a month-long run at the Village Theatre. He then performed a two-week London [[West End of London|West End]] run at the [[Wyndham's Theatre]], 1–13 November 2004.

His third major tour, ''Like, Totally'', opened at the [[Buxton Opera House]] on 3 May 2005,&lt;ref name="Maxwell Times"/&gt; and as with his previous tours the stand-up routine was accompanied by projected cartoons drawn by Moran. A DVD of the tour was released in December 2005. Moran appeared as the character of Gordon in the comedy film ''[[Run Fatboy Run]]'', released in September 2007 which cast Moran as the best friend to Dennis (''[[Shaun of the Dead]]'' co-star [[Simon Pegg]]), having played an adversary to Pegg's character in ''Shaun of the Dead''.

In June 2008, Moran appeared with [[Ardal O'Hanlon]] and [[Tommy Tiernan]] at the [[Echo Arena]] in 'The Three Fellas',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Anderson, Vicky|title=LIVERPOOL COMEDY FESTIVAL: The Three Fellas, Liverpool Echo Arena|url=http://www.liverpooldailypost.co.uk/liverpool-life-features/liverpool-arts/2008/06/16/liverpool-comedy-festival-the-three-fellas-liverpool-echo-arena-64375-21080016/|work=Liverpool Daily Post|date=16 June 2008|accessdate=5 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; a one-off comedy event, part of the city's 'European Capital of Culture 2008' celebrations. Between October and December 2008, Moran embarked on a new UK tour entitled ''What It Is'', starting at the [[Grand Opera House (York)|Grand Opera House]] in [[York]], and ending at [[Oxford]]'s New Theatre. Other notable venues include [[Colston Hall]] at [[Bristol]], [[Nottingham]]'s [[Nottingham Royal Concert Hall|Royal Concert Hall]], the [[Waterfront Hall]] Auditorium in [[Belfast]] and the Corran Halls in [[Oban]]. The tour was extended into 2009 and has now been released on DVD.

A compilation DVD of highlights from Moran's three previous stand up shows was made available in November 2010 called ''Dylan Moran: Aim Low''.

''Yeah, Yeah'', a stand-up tour of [[Scandinavia]], [[the Baltic states]], United States, Australia, [[New Zealand]], Ireland and the UK began in April 2011.

In 2012, Moran performed shows in Russia (following two sold-out performances in neighbouring Estonia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=DELFI |url=http://publik.delfi.ee/news/mitmesugust/black-booksi-staari-dylan-morani-etteaste-on-kui-naerutav-hingepeegel.d?id=64232565 |title="Black Booksi" staari Dylan Morani etteaste on kui naerutav hingepeegel - Publik |publisher=Publik.delfi.ee |date= |accessdate=3 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;).  The show's promoters indicated that they believed it to be the first time an Irish stand-up had performed live in a Russian venue; his routine referenced Russia's new law banning "homosexual propaganda" and jailed oil tycoon [[Mikhail Khodorkovsky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-17771847|title=Irish comedian Dylan Moran 'makes history' in Russia|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|date=19 April 2012|accessdate=19 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moran has written a pilot for ABC about "news media and conflict, war zones and cable news". ABC has however, decided not to go ahead with the show but may possibly sell it to another network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Graeme Virtue |url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/apr/05/dylan-moran-calvary-john-michael-mcdonagh |title=Dylan Moran: 'A lot of what's on TV now is filler' &amp;#124; Stage |publisher=The Guardian |date=5 April 2014 |accessdate=3 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2015, Moran took his latest stand-up show, "Off The Hook", to South Africa for the first time, performing three sold-out shows at the country's National Arts Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jennifer |url=http://bookslive.co.za/blog/2015/03/17/2015-national-arts-festival-line-up-announced-including-dylan-moran-of-black-books/ |title=2015 National Arts Festival Line-up Announced: Including Dylan Moran of Black Books |publisher=Books Live |date=5 April 2014 |accessdate=17 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Awards and commendations===
At the Edinburgh Festival Fringe he has won the 'So You Think You're Funny? Award' in 1993, and the [[Perrier Award]] in 1996, but later dismissed the latter as "a load of media rubbish," stating [[Bill Bailey]] deserved it more.

A popular poll commissioned by Channel 4 ranked him the 14th Greatest Comedy Stand-up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= 100 Greatest Comedy Comedy Stand-ups|url= http://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-100-greatest-stand-ups/articles/greatest-stand-ups-of-all-time|work= [[Channel4.com]]|date= n.d.|accessdate= 26 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moran was declared "the greatest comedian, living or dead" by the French newspaper ''[[Le Monde]]'' in July 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Le Monde, Issue 37954-2375a 29 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt; He has also twice won the [[BAFTA]] TV Award for Best Situation Comedy, both for ''[[Black Books]]''.
