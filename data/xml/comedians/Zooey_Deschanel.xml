==Early life==
Deschanel was born in [[Los Angeles, California]].&lt;ref name=tvg&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tvguide.com/celebrities/zooey-deschanel/179908/ | title=Zooey Deschanel | publisher= [[TV Guide|TVGuide.com]] | accessdate= November 9, 2015| archivedate= September 6, 2015 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150906054322/http://www.tvguide.com/celebrities/zooey-deschanel/179908/}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is the younger daughter of cinematographer and director [[Caleb Deschanel]] and actress [[Mary Jo Deschanel]] (née Weir). Her paternal grandfather was [[French people|French]], from [[Oullins]], [[Rhône (department)|Rhône]]; she also has [[Swiss people|Swiss]], [[Dutch people|Dutch]], [[English people|English]], [[Irish people|Irish]], and other [[French people|French]] ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Powell| first=Kimberly| url=http://genealogy.about.com/b/2011/11/01/ancestors-emily-deschanel.htm |title=Interesting Ancestors of Emily &amp; Zooey Deschanel |publisher=Genealogy.about.com |accessdate=October 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lat"&gt;{{cite news| last=Olsen |first=Mark |url=http://articles.latimes.com/print/2003/feb/16/entertainment/ca-olsen16 |title=A scene stealer steps off the sidelines |work=Los Angeles Times |date=February 16, 2003 |accessdate=December 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was named after [[Zooey Glass]], the male protagonist of [[J.

Deschanel lived in Los Angeles, but spent much of her childhood traveling because her father shot films on location; she later said that she "hated all the traveling ... I'm really happy now that I had the experience, but at the time I was just so miserable to have to leave my friends in Los Angeles and go to places where they didn't have any food I liked or things I was used to."&lt;ref name="globe"&gt;{{cite news| last=O'Hearn |first=Amber |title=From A to Zooey |work=Boston Globe |date=February 23, 2003 |url=http://www.fedge.net/~zdeschanel/articles/bostonglobe-2-23-03.html |accessdate=December 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; She attended [[Crossroads School (Santa Monica, California)|Crossroads]], a private preparatory school in Santa Monica, where she befriended future co-stars [[Jake Gyllenhaal]] and [[Kate Hudson]].&lt;ref name="nite"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nerdist"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nerdist Podcast 97: Zooey Deschanel |publisher=Nerdist |year=2011 |url=http://www.nerdist.com/2011/06/nerdist-podcast-97-zooey-deschanel/ |accessdate=February 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She sang throughout high school, planning to pursue a career in musical theatre and attending [[French Woods Festival of the Performing Arts]].&lt;ref name="lat"/&gt; She attended [[Northwestern University]] for nine months before dropping out to pursue acting.&lt;ref name="globe"/&gt;

==Acting career==
===1999–2002: Early acting credits===
Deschanel had a guest appearance on the television series ''[[Veronica's Closet]]'' in 1998 and made her film debut in [[Lawrence Kasdan]]'s comedy ''[[Mumford (film)|Mumford]]'' (1999), revolving around the neurotic residents in a small town and co-starring [[Hope Davis]], [[Jason Lee (actor)|Jason Lee]], [[Alfre Woodard]] and [[Mary McDonnell]]. Also in 1999, she appeared (non-singing) in the music video for [[The Offspring]]'s single "[[She's Got Issues]]". Deschanel co-starred in [[Cameron Crowe]]'s semi-autobiographical ''[[Almost Famous]]'' (2000), where she played Anita Miller, the rebellious older sister of a teenage journalist. Despite a modest box office response, the film received critical praise,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/almost_famous/ |title=Almost Famous&amp;nbsp;— Movie Reviews, Trailers, Pictures&amp;nbsp;— Rotten Tomatoes |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes&lt;! |accessdate=July 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; winning the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy|Golden Globe Award for Best Film – Musical or Comedy]]. Deschanel appeared in the independent drama ''[[Manic (2001 film)|Manic]]'' (2001), as the love interest of a troubled teen ([[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]]). The film was screened at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] and received a limited theatrical release. ''[[The New York Times]]'' found Deschanel to be "particularly spontaneous, unaffected and emotionally direct" in her role.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9501E6D8173DF936A15757C0A9659C8B63|title=Movie Review - 'Manic'|last=Kehr|first=Dave|date=April 25, 2003|website=nytimes.com|language=en|access-date=April 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following early notice, Deschanel took on supporting parts in four feature films released throughout 2002: [[Big Trouble (2002 film)|''Big Trouble'']], ''[[The New Guy]]'', ''[[The Good Girl]]'', and ''[[Abandon (2002 film)|Abandon]]''. In the comedy ''Big Trouble'', with [[Tim Allen]] and [[Rene Russo]], she played the daughter of a devoted and reluctant woman, and in the teen comedy ''The New Guy'', starred as a guitar player in a band. Deschanel portrayed a cynical, plain-spoken young woman working in a [[big-box store]] in the black dramedy ''The Good Girl'', opposite [[Jennifer Aniston]] and [[Jake Gyllenhaal]]. The psychological thriller ''Abandon'' saw her play the roommate of a woman involved in her boyfriend's disappearance. Deschanel also made a one-episode appearance in ''[[Frasier]]'', as an out-of-control young woman. ''The New York Times'' reported that Deschanel was "one of Hollywood's most sought-after young stars",&lt;ref name="nite"/&gt; in 2002, and the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote in early 2003 that Deschanel had become a recognizable [[typecasting (acting)|type]], due to "her deadpan, sardonic and scene-stealing [film] performances" as the protagonist's best friend.&lt;ref name="lat"/&gt; Deschanel objected to her typecasting, arguing, "A lot of these roles are just a formula idea of somebody's best friend, and it's like, I don't even have that many friends. In high school, I stayed home all the time, so I don't know how I'm everybody's best friend now."&lt;ref name="lat"/&gt;

===2003–2010: Breakthrough===
Deschanel obtained her first leading film role debut in the independent drama ''[[All the Real Girls]]'' (2003) as Noel, a sexually curious 18-year-old [[virgin]] who has a life-changing romance with an aimless 22-year-old. The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival and was an arthouse success. Her performance received wide critical acclaim,&lt;ref name="lat"/&gt; and ''Variety'' remarked: "Performances are all credible and naturalistic, but standing out from the rest is Deschanel’s work, which evinces an impressively direct connection to her character’s emotions. The actress does a wonderful job presenting a young woman who is trying, with varying degrees of success, to give voice to all sorts of things she has never felt or expressed before".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2003/film/reviews/all-the-real-girls-1200543799/|title=All the Real Girls|first=Todd|last=McCarthy|date=January 29, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; She received an [[Independent Spirit Award]] nomination for [[Independent Spirit Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2004 Best Female Lead: Zooey Deschanel - Actor - All the Real Girls |url=http://www.spiritawards.com/history-results |publisher=Spirit Awards |accessdate=April 29, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212000547/http://www.spiritawards.com/history-results |archivedate=December 12, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2003, Deschanel starred opposite [[Will Ferrell]] in the Christmas comedy ''[[Elf (film)|Elf]]'' as a deadpan department store worker and the love interest of a man raised by Santa's elves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Schwartz |first=Missy |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1225341,00.html |title=''Talledega Nights'' is a return to the top for Will Ferrell1 &amp;#124; Movies |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=August 18, 2006 |accessdate=July 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewers found the film to be a "spirited, good natured family comedy", as part of an overall positive critical response,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/elf/|title=Elf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and budgeted at US$33 million, ''Elf'' made US$220.4 million worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=elf.htm|title=Elf (2003) - Box Office Mojo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She also had a recurring role in four episodes of the [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] television series ''[[Weeds (TV series)|Weeds]]'' from 2006 to 2007 where she played Kat, [[Andy Botwin]]'s quirky ex-girlfriend. In September 2006, it was announced that Deschanel had signed on to play 1960s singer [[Janis Joplin]] in the film ''The Gospel According to Janis'', to be co-written and directed by [[Penelope Spheeris]].&lt;ref name="jan"&gt;{{cite web | author=Fleming, Michael | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117950313.html?categoryid=10&amp;cs=1&amp;query=%22zooey+deschanel%22+AND+%22janis%22 | title=Wheels turning on Spheeris' Joplin bio: Deschanel takes 'Janis' role | work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=September 18, 2006 | accessdate=December 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was scheduled to begin shooting in 2006, but was then postponed indefinitely;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Adler, Shawn |url=http://www.vh1.com/movies/news/articles/1554985/20070319/story.jhtml |title=Zooey Deschanel Says Janis Joplin Biopic Is 'On Hold'&amp;nbsp;— For Now |publisher=MTV News |accessdate=March 20, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070526023837/http://www.vh1.com/movies/news/articles/1554985/20070319/story.jhtml |archivedate=May 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it was then resurrected again, with a planned release date of 2012, before being cancelled altogether in 2011. Deschanel expressed frustration with the cancellation, saying she had spent three years working on imitating Joplin's scratchy singing voice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zooey Deschanel's 'Janis Joplin project' scrapped|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/movies/news/a344911/zooey-deschanels-janis-joplin-project-scrapped.html#~oCPiXxYF0v6mTI|work=Digital Spy|accessdate=April 29, 2014|author=Tara Fowler |date=October 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Deschanel appeared in two children's films: ''[[Bridge to Terabithia (2007 film)|Bridge to Terabithia]]'', in which she played a quirky music teacher, and the animated film ''[[Surf's Up (film)|Surf's Up]]'', voicing a penguin. She took on the brief role of Dorothy Evans in the [[revisionist Western]] ''[[The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford]]'' and starred in the [[B movie|B]] comedy ''[[Flakes (film)|Flakes]]'', which was released in only one theater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=flakes.htm|title=Flakes (2007) - Box Office Mojo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deschanel starred as DG in the [[Syfy|Syfy Channel]] miniseries ''[[Tin Man (miniseries)|Tin Man]]'', a re-imagined science fiction version of ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]''.
