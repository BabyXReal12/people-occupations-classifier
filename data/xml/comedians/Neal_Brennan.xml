Brennan's older brother [[Kevin Brennan (comedian)|Kevin]] became a comedian and writer who started doing [[stand-up comedy]] while Neal was still in [[high school]].&lt;ref name=CHICAGONOW1/&gt; Neal attended Kevin's performances at [[The Improv]] in [[New York City]] on weekends,&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; where he would meet comedians such as [[Ray Romano]], [[Dave Attell]], [[Mike Royce]] and [[David Juskow]].&lt;ref name=CAREER/&gt;&lt;ref name=ALIVE/&gt; Brennan said in an interview with [[IFC (U.S. TV channel)|Independent Film Channel]] (IFC) that, after watching his brother do stand-up, he realized it was possible to make a living in comedy.&lt;ref name=IFC/&gt;

In 1997, Brennan and Chappelle collaborated for the first time on the screenplay for the film ''[[Half Baked]]''.&lt;ref name=CAREER/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT2&gt;{{cite news|title=A Comic Who Won't Hold Back; Nothing Is Out of Bounds For Dave Chappelle's Show|first=Lola|last=Ogunnaike|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/18/arts/a-comic-who-won-t-hold-back-nothing-is-out-of-bounds-for-dave-chappelle-s-show.html?pagewanted=3&amp;src=pm|newspaper=New York Times|date=February 18, 2004|accessdate=April 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was released in January 1998 and starred Chappelle, [[Jim Breuer]], [[Harland Williams]] and [[Guillermo Díaz (actor)|Guillermo Díaz]].&lt;ref name=CAREER/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT3&gt;{{cite news|title=Half Baked (1998) FILM REVIEW; Marijuana Moments, Many of Them|first=Lola|last=Ogunnaike|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B02E0D91738F934A25752C0A96E958260|newspaper=New York Times|date=January 18, 1998|accessdate=April 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Half Baked'' was a commercial failure and received mainly negative reviews but has become a cult classic.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;&lt;ref name=BUZZBIN&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buzzbinmagazine.com/home/2011/07/18/taking-the-leap-with-neal-brennan/|title=Taking the Leap with Neal Brennan|last=Flannigan|first=W.|date=July 18, 2011|work=buzzbinmagazine.com|accessdate=April 20, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509074949/http://www.buzzbinmagazine.com/home/2011/07/18/taking-the-leap-with-neal-brennan/|archivedate=May 9, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=VARIETY&gt;{{cite news|title=Half Baked|first=Brendan|last=Kelly|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117436781?refcatid=31|newspaper=Variety|date=January 19, 1998|accessdate=April 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2006 interview, Brennan referred to the period of the film's release as "probably the worst year of my life, creatively and personally."&lt;ref name=CAREER/&gt; In an interview that same year on ''[[Inside the Actor's Studio]]'', Chappelle recounted how he and Brennan lost touch with each other after the release of ''Half Baked'', saying that it was "like leaving a crime scene".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Dave Chappelle|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84NjYRTHpfU| accessdate=April 20, 2012|series=Inside the Actors Studio|airdate=February 12, 2006|time=55:00}}&lt;/ref&gt;
