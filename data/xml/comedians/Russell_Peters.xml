==Career==
Peters began performing in Toronto in 1989. He has since gone on to perform in several countries worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mohr|first=Jay|title=Mohr Stories 87: Russell Peters|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/mohr-stories-fakemustache.com/id448795390|work=Mohr Stories|publisher=Fake Mustache Studios|accessdate=8 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, Peters met American comedian [[George Carlin]], one of his biggest influences, who advised him to get on stage whenever and wherever possible. Peters said he "took that advice to heart, and I think that's the reason I am where I am now."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.russellpeters.com/Press/Russell-Peters---10-Comics-to-Watch_4 Russell Peters - 10 Comics to Watch] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403034823/http://russellpeters.com/Press/Russell-Peters---10-Comics-to-Watch_4 |date=2013-04-03 }} RussellPeters.com. Accessed on March 25, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, 15 years later, he hosted one of Carlin's last shows before Carlin's death the following year.&lt;ref name="peters"/&gt;

Peters credits his 2004 performance on the Canadian TV comedy show ''[[Comedy Now!]]'', which was uploaded onto [[YouTube]] and became [[viral video|viral]], as the turning point in his career. While the initial video upload featured his entire 45-minute performance, YouTube users subsequently uploaded segments of the performance in which Peters focused on individual cultural groups. According to Peters, those segments made their way to the "targeted" cultural groups and were well received by them. The video and its viral nature was referred to by Peters on his performance, ''Outsourced''; when the audience cheered when he referred to earlier jokes, he exclaimed, "Look at you, you filthy downloaders!"&lt;ref name="Russell Peters: Outsourced Aired on COMEDYP&amp;nbsp;— Ark TV Transcript"&gt;{{cite web|title=Russell Peters: Outsourced Aired on COMEDYP&amp;nbsp;— Ark TV Transcript|url=http://tv.ark.com/transcript/russell_peters__outsourced/6732/COMEDYP/Saturday_December_19_2009/140807/|website=tv.ark.com|accessdate=1 September 2015|ref=Russell Peters: Outsourced Aired on COMEDYP&amp;nbsp;— Ark TV Transcript|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160111234057/http://tv.ark.com/transcript/russell_peters__outsourced/6732/COMEDYP/Saturday_December_19_2009/140807/|archive-date=11 January 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comedic style==
Peters's stand-up performances feature [[observational comedy]], using humour to highlight racial, ethnic, class and cultural stereotypes. He often refers to his own experiences growing up in an Anglo-Indian family, and impersonates the accents of various ethnic groups to poke fun at them. As he told an audience in San Francisco, "I don't make the stereotypes, I just see them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Piccalo|first=Gina|title=No joke&amp;nbsp;— Russell Peters is a famous comedian|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/apr/16/entertainment/la-et--russell-peters-20100416|accessdate=29 January 2012|newspaper=LA Times|date=16 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2006 interview with ''[[The National (CBC)|The National]],'' Peters observed that he did not intend to put down or offend different races and cultures, but tried to "raise them up through humour".&lt;ref&gt;Clifton Joseph, "Russell Peters Interview on CBC The National, May 30th 2006"&lt;/ref&gt;

Peters is widely known for his punchline, "Somebody gonna get a hurt real bad." It ends a joke he tells about his childhood with a traditional Indian father, who used corporal punishment on his sons. Another punchline he uses is "Be a man! Do the right thing!", which relates to a story of a Chinese man trying to get him to pay more for an item at a shop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nguyen|first=An|title=Defying Stereotypes and Breaking All Laws of Decency, Russell Peters Lets It All Hang Out|url=http://culturemagazine.ca/culture/defying_stereotypes_and_breaking_all_laws_of_decency_russell_peters_lets_it_all_hang_out.html|accessdate=29 January 2012|newspaper=(Cult)ure magazine|date=19 May 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111115223351/http://culturemagazine.ca/culture/defying_stereotypes_and_breaking_all_laws_of_decency_russell_peters_lets_it_all_hang_out.html|archivedate=15 November 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When interviewer [[Larry King]] asked Peters, "Is there such a thing as too taboo?", Peters replied, "I don't talk about religion because I think people are a little weird about religion, especially nowadays, and I'm more of a science guy than I am a beliefs guy. I'm more into facts than I am into beliefs."&lt;ref&gt;''Larry King Now'',  Ora TV https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kunZO5i2JnA (1:30)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ora.tv/larrykingnow/2014/8/6/lknpetersrussell004-0_5yhqhlfpfu7y|title=Russell Peters: I Don’t Talk About Religion|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In an interview with ''Al Jazeera'', Peters said he "refuses" to talk about religion.&lt;ref&gt;''Al Jazeera'' English: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKXxiccJx9c (3:30)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/17/russell-peters-avoids-religion-in-his-comedy-act/|title=Russell Peters avoids religion in his comedy act|first=The Washington Times|last=http://www.washingtontimes.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
