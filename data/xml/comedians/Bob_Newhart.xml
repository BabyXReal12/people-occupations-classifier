'''George Robert Newhart''' (born September 5, 1929) is an American [[stand-up comedy|stand-up comedian]] and [[actor]], noted for his [[deadpan]] and slightly [[stammering]] delivery. Newhart came to prominence in 1960 when his album of comedic [[monologues]], ''[[The Button-Down Mind of Bob Newhart]]'', became a worldwide bestseller and reached number one on the ''Billboard'' pop album chart; it remains the 20th-best selling comedy album in history.&lt;ref&gt;Manilla, Ben. "[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=17561805 'Button-Down Mind' Changed Modern Comedy]", October 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The follow-up album, ''The Button-Down Mind Strikes Back!'', was also a success, and the two albums held the ''Billboard'' number one and number two spots simultaneously.&lt;ref name=autobio&gt;{{cite book |last =Newhart|first =Bob|title =I Shouldn't Even Be Doing This!|publisher =Hyperion|year=2006|location =New York|isbn =1-4013-0246-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newhart later went into acting, starring as Chicago psychologist Dr. Robert Hartley in ''[[The Bob Newhart Show]]'' during the 1970s and then as Vermont innkeeper Dick Loudon on the [[1980s in television|1980s]] series ''[[Newhart]]''. He also had two short-lived sitcoms in the 1990s titled ''[[Bob (TV series)|Bob]]'' and ''[[George and Leo]]''. Newhart also appeared in film roles such as [[Major Major Major Major|Major Major]] in ''[[Catch-22 (film)|Catch-22]]'' and Papa Elf in ''[[Elf (movie)|Elf]]''. He provided the voice of Bernard in the [[The Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney]] animated films ''[[The Rescuers]]'' and ''[[The Rescuers Down Under]]''. In 2004, he played the library head [[List of characters in The Librarian franchise#Judson (Bob Newhart)|Judson]] in ''[[The Librarian (franchise)|The Librarian]]'', a character which continued in 2014 to the TV series ''[[The Librarians (2014 TV series)|The Librarians]]''. In 2013, Newhart made his first of five guest appearances on ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]'' as Professor Proton, for which he received his first [[Primetime Emmy Award]] on September 15, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bob Newhart finally gets his Emmy Award|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/sep/16/bob-newhart-finally-gets-his-emmy-award/|publisher=Washington Times|accessdate=September 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Newhart was born on September 5, 1929 at West Suburban Hospital in [[Oak Park, Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cookcountyclerk.com/sweethomecookcounty/documents/2007sweethome.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=May 29, 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160528132937/http://www.cookcountyclerk.com/sweethomecookcounty/documents/2007sweethome.pdf |archivedate=May 28, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents were George David Newhart (1899–1986), a part-owner of a plumbing and heating-supply business, and Julia Pauline (''née'' Burns; 1901–1991), a housewife. His mother was of [[Irish people|Irish]] descent and his father was of [[English people|English]], Irish, and [[German people|German]] ancestry.&lt;ref name="autobio" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.naplesnews.com/entertainment/celebrity/review-comedian-bob-newhart-tickles-naples-funnybone-299df21e-4b6d-012d-e053-0100007fab55-365643521.html|title=Comedian Bob Newhart tickles Naples' funnybone|publisher=|accessdate=April 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of his grandmothers was from [[St. Catharines]], Ontario, Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Misunderstanding Thorold, feeling good about St. Catharines |author= Herod, Doug |url= http://www.stcatharinesstandard.ca/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=2211240 |archive-url= https://archive.is/20120910110235/http://www.stcatharinesstandard.ca/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=2211240 |dead-url= yes |archive-date= September 10, 2012 |newspaper= St Catharines Standard |date= December 8, 2009 |accessdate= April 6, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Newhart has three sisters: Virginia, Mary Joan (a nun, who taught at the all-girls Carmel High School in [[Mundelein, Illinois]]), and Pauline.

Newhart was educated at [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] schools in the Chicago area, including St. Catherine of Siena grammar school in Oak Park, and attended [[St. Ignatius College Prep]] (high school), graduating in 1947. He then enrolled at [[Loyola University of Chicago]] from which he graduated in 1952 with a bachelor's degree in business management.

Newhart was drafted into the [[United States Army]] and served in the United States during the [[Korean War]] as a personnel manager until being discharged in 1954. Newhart briefly attended [[Loyola University Chicago School of Law]], but did not complete a degree, in part, he says, because he was asked to behave unethically during an internship.&lt;ref name=autobio/&gt;

==Career==
After the war, Newhart worked for [[USG Corporation|United States Gypsum]] as an accountant. He later said that his motto, "That's close enough" and his habit of adjusting [[petty cash]] imbalances with his own money shows he did not have the temperament to be an accountant.&lt;ref name=autobio/&gt; He also said he was a clerk in the [[unemployment benefits|unemployment office]] who made $55 a week, but who quit upon learning unemployment benefits were $45 a week and he "only had to come in to the office one day a week to collect it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/database/newhart_b.html|title= Interview with Bob Newhart | publisher= PBS|work= [[American Masters]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comedy career beginnings===
In 1958, Newhart became an advertising [[copywriter]] for Fred A. Niles, a major independent film and television producer in Chicago.&lt;ref name="MargaretMick2011"&gt;{{cite book | author1=Margaret Hicks | author2=Mick Napier | title=Chicago Comedy: A Fairly Serious History | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8GB83XHjwh0C&amp;pg=PA66 | accessdate=November 24, 2012 | date=May 2, 2011 | publisher=The History Press | isbn=978-1-60949-211-3 | page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; There, he and a co-worker entertained each other with long telephone calls about absurd scenarios, which they later recorded and sent to radio stations as audition tapes. When his co-worker ended his participation, Newhart continued the recordings alone, developing this type of routine. 

Dan Sorkin, a [[disc jockey]] at a radio station who later became the announcer-sidekick on Newhart's NBC series, introduced Newhart to the head of talent at [[Warner Bros. Records]]. The label signed him in 1959, only a year after it was formed, based solely on those recordings. Newhart expanded his material into a [[stand-up comedy|stand-up routine]], which he began to perform at nightclubs.&lt;ref name=autobio/&gt;

===Albums===
Newhart became famous mostly on the strength of his audio releases, in which he played a solo "[[double act|straight man]]". Newhart's routine was to portray one end of a conversation (usually a phone call), playing the comedic straight man and implying what the other person was saying.

His 1960 comedy album, ''The Button-Down Mind of Bob Newhart'', was the first comedy album to make number one on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' charts.&lt;ref name=parade&gt;{{cite news | title = In Step With: Bob Newhart | publisher = Parade Magazine | date = July 17, 2005 | url = http://www.parade.com/articles/editions/2005/edition_07-17-2005/in_step_with_0 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070315020844/http://www.parade.com/articles/editions/2005/edition_07-17-2005/in_step_with_0 | archivedate = March 15, 2007 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The album received the [[Grammy Awards of 1961|1961 Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]]. The album peaked at number two in the [[UK Albums Chart]].&lt;ref name="British Hit Singles &amp; Albums"&gt;{{cite book

Newhart told a 2005 interviewer for [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]'s ''[[American Masters]]'' that his favorite stand-up routine is "[[Abraham Lincoln|Abe Lincoln]] vs. [[Madison Avenue]]", which appears on this album. In the routine, a slick promoter has to deal with the reluctance of the eccentric President to agree to efforts to boost his image. The routine was suggested to Newhart by Chicago TV director and future comedian [[Bill Daily]], who was Newhart's castmate on the 1970s ''The Bob Newhart Show'' for CBS. Newhart became known for using an intentional stammer, in service to his unique combination of politeness and disbelief at what he was supposedly hearing. Newhart has used the delivery throughout his career.

The follow-up album, ''The Button-Down Mind Strikes Back'', was released six months later and won [[Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album|Best Comedy Performance - Spoken Word]] that same year. Subsequent comedy albums include ''Behind the Button-Down Mind of Bob Newhart'' (1961), ''The Button-Down Mind on TV'' (1962), ''Bob Newhart Faces Bob Newhart'' (1964), ''The Windmills Are Weakening'' (1965), ''This Is It'' (1967), ''Best of Bob Newhart'' (1971), and ''Very Funny Bob Newhart'' (1973). Years later, he released ''Bob Newhart Off the Record'' (1992), ''The Button-Down Concert'' (1997), and ''Something Like This'' (2001), an anthology of his 1960s Warner Bros. albums.

On December 10, 2015, it was revealed by publicist and comedy album collector Jeff Abraham that a "lost" Newhart track from 1965 about [[Paul Revere]] existed on a one-of-a-kind acetate, which he owns.  The track made its world premiere on episode 163 of the ''Comedy on Vinyl'' [[podcast]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theinterrobang.com/199318-2/ |title=Lost Bob Newhart Routine Airs Publicly for the First Time |date=December 10, 2015 |website=The Interrobang |access-date=December 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television===
Newhart's success in stand-up led to his own short-lived [[NBC]] [[variety show]] in 1961, ''[[The Bob Newhart Show (1961 TV series)|The Bob Newhart Show]]''. The show lasted only a single season, but it earned Newhart a [[Primetime Emmy Award]] nomination and a [[Peabody Award]]. The Peabody Board cited him as:
{{Cquote|a person whose gentle satire and wry and irreverent wit waft a breath of fresh and bracing air through the stale and stuffy electronic corridors. A merry marauder, who looks less like St. George than a choirboy, Newhart has wounded, if not slain, many of the dragons that stalk our society. In a troubled and apprehensive world, Newhart has proved once again that laughter is the best medicine.}}

In the mid-1960s, Newhart appeared on ''[[The Dean Martin Show]]'' 24 times, and on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' eight times.&lt;ref name=autobio/&gt; He appeared in a 1963 episode of ''[[List of The Alfred Hitchcock Hour episodes|The Alfred Hitchcock Hour]]'', "How to Get Rid of Your Wife", and on ''[[The Judy Garland Show]]''. Newhart guest-hosted ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' 87 times, and hosted ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' twice, 15 years apart (1980 and 1995).

In addition to stand-up comedy, Newhart became a dedicated character actor. This led to other series such as: ''[[Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre]]'', ''[[Captain Nice]]'', two episodes of ''Insight'', and ''[[It's Garry Shandling's Show]]''. He reprised his role as Dr. Bob Hartley on ''[[Murphy Brown]]'', and appeared as himself on ''[[The Simpsons]]'', and as a retired forensic pathologist on ''[[NCIS (TV series)|NCIS]]''.

Newhart guest-starred on three episodes of ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'', for which he was nominated for a [[Primetime Emmy Award]],&lt;ref name=autobio/&gt; as well as on ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'' and a role on ''[[NCIS (TV series)|NCIS]]'' as [[Ducky Mallard|Ducky]]'s mentor and predecessor, who was discovered to have [[Alzheimer's disease]]. In 2013, he also appeared on ''[[Committed (2005 TV series)|Committed]]'' and appeared in an episode of the sixth season of ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]'', for which he was awarded a [[Primetime Emmy Award]], and subsequent episodes in its seventh, ninth, and eleventh seasons, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='The Big Bang Theory' Season 6: Bob Newhart to Play Professor Proton |website= TVLine|url=http://tvline.com/2013/03/21/the-big-bang-theory-season-6-cast-bob-newhart-professor-proton/|accessdate=March 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Films===
Although he is primarily a television star, Newhart has been in a number of popular films, beginning with the 1962 war story ''[[Hell Is for Heroes (film)|Hell Is for Heroes]]''. In 1968, Newhart played an annoying software specialist in the film ''[[Hot Millions]]''.  His films have ranged from 1970's [[Alan Jay Lerner]] musical ''[[On a Clear Day You Can See Forever]]'', the 1971 [[Norman Lear]] comedy ''[[Cold Turkey (film)|Cold Turkey]]'', the [[Mike Nichols]]-directed war satire ''[[Catch-22 (film)|Catch 22]]'', the Walt Disney animated feature ''[[The Rescuers]]'' in 1977 and with its 1990 sequel ''[[The Rescuers Down Under]]'', and the [[Will Ferrell]] holiday comedy ''[[Elf (film)|Elf]]'' (2003).

Newhart played the President of the United States in the comedy, ''[[First Family (film)|First Family]]'' (1980). He appeared as a beleaguered school principal in ''[[In &amp; Out (film)|In &amp; Out]]'' (1997). He made a [[cameo appearance]] as a sadistic but appreciative CEO at the end of the comedy ''[[Horrible Bosses]]'' (2011).

==Sitcoms==

===''The Bob Newhart Show''===
[[File:Newhart show cast 1977.JPG|thumb|right|Standing, from left: Howard Borden, Carol Kester, Jerry Robinson, seated: Newhart and Emily Hartley]]
Newhart's most notable exposure on television came from two long-running programs that centered on him. In 1972, soon after Newhart guest-starred on ''[[The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour]]'', he was approached by his agent and his managers, producer [[Grant Tinker]], and actress [[Mary Tyler Moore]] (the husband/wife team who founded [[MTM Enterprises]]), to work on a pilot series called ''[[The Bob Newhart Show]]'', to be written by Davis and Music. He was very interested in the starring role of dry psychologist Bob Hartley, with [[Suzanne Pleshette]] playing his wry, loving wife, Emily, and [[Bill Daily]] as neighbor and friend Howard Borden.

''The Bob Newhart Show'' faced heavy competition from the beginning, launching at the same time as the popular shows ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', ''[[Maude (TV series)|Maude]]'', ''[[Sanford And Son]]'', and ''[[The Waltons]]''. Nevertheless, it was an immediate hit. The show eventually referenced what made Newhart's name in the first place. Apart from the first few episodes, it used an opening-credits sequence featuring Newhart answering a telephone in his office. According to co-star [[Marcia Wallace]], the entire cast got along well, and Newhart became close friends with both Wallace and co-star Suzanne Pleshette.

The cast also included Marcia Wallace as Bob's wisecracking, man-chasing receptionist, Carol Kester; [[Peter Bonerz]] as amiable orthodontist Jerry Robinson; [[Jack Riley (actor)|Jack Riley]] as Elliot Carlin, the most misanthropic of Hartley's patients; character actor and voice artist, [[John Fiedler]] as milquetoast Emil Petersen; and Pat Finley as Bob's sister, Ellen Hartley, a love interest for Howard Borden. Future ''Newhart'' regular [[Tom Poston]] had a briefly recurring role as Cliff "Peeper" Murdock, veteran stage actor [[Barnard Hughes]] appeared as Bob's father for three episodes spread over two seasons, and [[Martha Scott]] appeared in several episodes as Bob's mother.

By 1977, the show's ratings were declining and Newhart wanted to end it, but was under contract to do one more season. The show's writers tried to rework the sitcom by adding a pregnancy, but Newhart objected: "I told the creators I didn't want any children, because I didn't want it to be a show about 'How stupid Daddy is, but we love him so much, let's get him out of the trouble he's gotten himself into'." Nevertheless, the staff wrote an episode that they hoped would change Newhart's mind. Newhart read the script and he agreed it was very funny. He then asked, "Who are you going to get to play Bob?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.televisionheaven.co.uk/newhart1.htm |title=The Bob Newhart Show &amp;#124; A Television Heaven Review |publisher=Televisionheaven.co.uk |date=September 5, 1929 |accessdate=December 11, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105210744/http://www.televisionheaven.co.uk/newhart1.htm |archivedate=January 5, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Coincidentally, Newhart's wife gave birth to their daughter Jenny late in the year, which caused him to miss several episodes.

In the last episode of the fifth season, not only was Bob's wife, Emily, pregnant, but his receptionist, Carol, was, too. In the first show of the sixth season, Bob revealed his dream of the pregnancies and that neither Emily nor Carol was really pregnant.

Marcia Wallace spoke of Newhart's amiable nature on set: "He's very low key, and he didn't want to cause trouble. I had a dog by the name of Maggie that I used to bring to the set. And whenever there was a line that Bob didn't like—he didn't want to complain too much—so, he'd go over, get down on his hands and knees, and repeat the line to the dog, which invariably yawned; and he'd say, 'See, I told you it's not funny!'" Wallace has also commented on the show's lack of Emmy recognition: "People think we were nominated for many an Emmy, people presume we won Emmys, all of us, and certainly Bob, and certainly the show. Nope, never!"

Newhart discontinued the series in 1978 after six seasons and 142 episodes. Wallace said of its ending, "It was much crying and sobbing. It was so sad. We really did get along. We really had great times together." Of Newhart's other long-running sitcom, ''[[Newhart]]'', Wallace said, "But some of the other great comedic talents who had a brilliant show, when they tried to do it twice, it didn't always work. And that's what... but like Bob, as far as I'm concerned, Bob is like the Fred Astaire of comics. He just makes it look so easy, and he's not as in-your-face as some might be. And so, you just kind of take it for granted, how extraordinarily funny and how he wears well." She was later reunited with Newhart twice, once in a reprise of her role as Carol on ''Murphy Brown'' in 1994, and on an episode of Newhart's short-lived sitcom, ''George &amp; Leo'', in 1997.

===''Newhart''===
[[File:Bob Newhart crop.jpg|thumb|left|Newhart at the 1987 Emmy Awards]]
By 1982, Newhart was interested in a new [[sitcom]]. After he had discussions with [[Barry Kemp (TV producer)|Barry Kemp]] and [[Columbia Broadcasting System|CBS]], the show ''[[Newhart]]'' was created, in which Newhart played [[Vermont]] innkeeper and TV talk show host Dick Loudon.  [[Mary Frann]] was cast as his wife, Joanna.  Jennifer Holmes was originally cast as Leslie Vanderkellen, but left after former daytime soap star [[Julia Duffy]] joined the cast as Dick's inn maid and spoiled rich girl, Stephanie Vanderkellen.  [[Peter Scolari]] (who had been a fan of Newhart's since he was 17) was also cast as Dick's [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]] TV producer, Michael Harris, in six of the eight seasons. Character actor [[Tom Poston]] played the role of handyman George Utley, earning three Primetime Emmy Award nominations as Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series in 1984, 1986, and 1987. Like ''The Bob Newhart Show'', ''Newhart'' was an immediate hit, and again, like the show before it, it was also nominated for Primetime Emmy Awards, but failed to win any. During the time Newhart was working on the show, in 1985, his smoking habit finally caught up to him, and he was taken to the emergency room for secondary [[polycythemia]]. The doctors ordered him to stop smoking.

In 1987, ratings began to drop. ''Newhart'' ended in 1990 after eight seasons and 182 episodes. The last episode ended with a scene in which Newhart wakes up in bed with Suzanne Pleshette, who had played Emily, his wife from ''The Bob Newhart Show''. He realizes (in a satire of a famous plot element in the television series ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'' a few years earlier) that the entire eight-year ''Newhart'' series had been a single nightmare of Dr. Bob Hartley's, which Emily attributes to eating Japanese food before he went to bed. Recalling Mary Frann's buxom figure and proclivity for wearing sweaters, Bob closes the segment and the series by telling Emily, "You really should wear more sweaters" before the typical closing notes of the old ''Bob Newhart Show'' theme played over the fadeout. The twist ending was later chosen by ''[[TV Guide]]'' as the best finale in television history.

===Other TV series===

In 1992, Newhart returned to television with a series called ''[[Bob (TV series)|Bob]]'', about a [[cartoonist]]. An ensemble cast included [[Lisa Kudrow]], but the show did not develop a strong audience and was cancelled shortly after the start of its second season, despite good critical reviews. (On ''The Tonight Show'' following the cancellation, Newhart joked he had now done shows called ''The Bob Newhart Show'', ''Newhart'' and ''Bob'' so his next show was going to be called ''The''.)

In 1997, Newhart returned again with ''George &amp; Leo'' on CBS with [[Judd Hirsch]] and [[Jason Bateman]] (Newhart's first name being George); the show was cancelled during its first season.

In 1995, a 65-year-old Newhart was approached by the [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] cable network to appear in the first comedy special in his 35-year career. His special ''Off The Record'' consisted of him performing material from his first and second albums in front of a live audience in Pasadena, California. In 2003, Newhart guest-starred on three episodes of ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'' in a rare dramatic role that earned him an Primetime Emmy Award nomination, his first in nearly 20 years. In 2005, he began a recurring role in ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'' as Morty, the on-again/off-again boyfriend of Sophie ([[Lesley Ann Warren]]), Susan Mayer's ([[Teri Hatcher]]) mother. In 2009, he received another Primetime Emmy nomination for reprising his role as Judson in ''[[The Librarian: Curse of the Judas Chalice]]''.

On August 27, 2006, at the [[58th Primetime Emmy Awards]], hosted by [[Conan O'Brien]], Newhart was placed in a supposedly airtight glass prison that contained three hours of air. If the Emmys went over the time of three hours, he would die. This gag was an acknowledgment of the common frustration that award shows usually run on past their allotted time (which is usually three hours). Newhart "survived" his containment to help O'Brien present the award for Outstanding Comedy Series (which went to ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]'').

During an episode of ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'', Newhart made a comedic cameo with members of ABC's show ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'' lampooning an alternate ending to the series finale. In 2011, Newhart appeared in a small but pivotal role as a doctor in Lifetime's anthology film on breast cancer ''Five'', and in 2013, he made a guest appearance on ''The Big Bang Theory ''as the aged Professor Proton (Arthur Jeffries), a former science TV show host turned children's party entertainer, for which he won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/bob-newhart Bob Newhart | Television Academy]. Emmys.com. Retrieved on April 12, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; It marked the first Emmy in Newhart's entire career. At that year's Emmy ceremony, Newhart appeared as a presenter with ''Big Bang Theory'' star [[Jim Parsons]] and received an unexpected standing ovation.

On December 19, 2014, Newhart made a surprise appearance on the final episode of ''[[The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson]]'', where he was revealed to be the person inside Secretariat, Ferguson's on-set pantomime horse. The show then ended with a scene parodying the ''Newhart'' series finale, with Ferguson and [[Drew Carey]] reprising their roles from ''[[The Drew Carey Show]]''. In June 2015, Newhart appeared on another series finale, the final episode of ''[[Hot in Cleveland]]'' playing the father-in-law of Joy Scroggs ([[Jane Leeves]]). It marked a reunion with one time co-star [[Betty White]] who had been a cast member during the second season of ''[[Bob (TV series)|Bob]]'' 23 years earlier. The finale ends with their characters getting married.

==Personal comedic style==
Newhart is known for his [[deadpan]] delivery and a slight [[Stuttering|stammer]] which he incorporated early on into the persona around which he built a successful career.&lt;ref name=autobio/&gt; On his TV shows, although he got his share of funny lines, he worked often in the [[Jack Benny]] tradition of being the "straight man" while the sometimes rather bizarre cast members surrounding him got the laughs. Newhart, however, has stated that "I was not influenced by Jack Benny" in terms of his style or persona, and cites [[George Gobel]] and the comedy team of [[Bob and Ray]] as his initial writing and performance inspirations.&lt;ref name="Thorn"&gt;Thorn, Jesse. (May 16, 2012) [http://www.avclub.com/articles/bob-newhart-talks-about-standup-sitcoms-and-why-he,75185/ Bob Newhart talks about stand-up, sitcoms, and why he stays busy · Interview · The A.V. Club]. Avclub.com. Retrieved on April 12, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Several of his routines involve hearing one-half of a conversation as he speaks to someone over the phone. In a bit called "King Kong", a rookie security guard at the [[Empire State Building]] seeks guidance as to how to deal with an ape that is "between 18 and 19 stories high, depending on whether there's a [[Thirteenth floor|13th floor]] or not." He assures his boss he has looked in the guards' manual "under 'ape' and 'ape's toes'." Other famous routines include "The Driving Instructor", "The Mrs. Grace L. Ferguson Airline (and Storm Door Company)", "Introducing Tobacco to Civilization", "Abe Lincoln vs. Madison Avenue", "Defusing a Bomb" (in which an uneasy police chief tries to walk a new and nervous patrolman through defusing a live shell discovered on a beach), "The Retirement Party", "Ledge Psychology", "The Krushchev Landing Rehearsal", and "A Friend With a Dog."

In a 2012 podcast interview with [[Marc Maron]], comedian [[Shelley Berman]] accused Newhart of plagiarizing his improvisational telephone routine style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episodes/episode_332_-_shelley_berman|title=Episode 332 - Shelley Berman|work=WTF with Marc Maron Podcast}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in interviews both years before and after Berman's comments, Newhart has never taken credit for originating the telephone concept, which he has noted was done earlier by Berman and -- predating Berman -- [[Nichols and May]], [[George Jessel (actor)|George Jessel]] (in his well-known sketch "Hello Mama"), and in the 1913 recording "[[Cohen on the Telephone]]".  The technique would later also be used by [[Lily Tomlin]], [[Ellen DeGeneres]], and many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Martel|first=Ned|title=For Bob Newhart, Dean of Deadpan, the Laughs Go On|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/12/arts/television/12bob.html?_r=0|newspaper=New York Times|date=April 12, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thorn"/&gt;

==Writings==
On September 20, 2006, Hyperion Books released Newhart's first book, ''I Shouldn't Even Be Doing This''. The book is primarily a memoir, but features comic bits by Newhart, as well. Transcripts of many of Newhart's classic routines are woven in with the rest of the text. As actor [[David Hyde Pierce]] notes, "The only difference between Bob Newhart on stage and Bob Newhart offstage &amp;ndash; is that there is no stage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/tv/la-et-newhart19sep19,1,1987080.story?coll=la-entnews-tv | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Matthew | last=DeBord | date=September 19, 2006 | title=Bob Newhart is cool.

The statue depicts Dr. Hartley sitting in his therapy practice chair with a pencil held between his hands, and a patients' sofa next to him. After an initial temporary installation in front of 430 North Michigan Avenue, the building used for exterior establishing shots of Hartley's office, the bronze set is now permanently located in the sculpture park in front of Chicago's [[Navy Pier]] entertainment complex. Visitors routinely sit on the couch and pose for photographs as Bob's patients.

==Personal life==
Newhart was introduced by [[Buddy Hackett]] to Virginia "Ginnie" Quinn, the daughter of character actor [[Bill Quinn]].&lt;ref name=autobio/&gt; They were married on January 12, 1963. The couple have four children (Robert, Timothy, Jennifer, and Courtney), and ten grandchildren.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; They are Roman Catholic and raised their children as such.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adherents.com/people/pn/Bob_Newhart.html|title=The religion of Bob Newhart, comedian, sitcom actor|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a member of the Good Shepherd Parish and the Catholic Motion Picture Guild in [[Beverly Hills, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goodshepherdbh.org/a-city-on-a-hill/our-history/|title=Our History|work=Church of the Good Shepherd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newhart's best friend was comedian [[Don Rickles]], who nicknamed him "Charlie Everybody" for his [[everyman]] persona.

In 1985, Newhart was rushed to the emergency room, suffering from secondary polycythemia, after years of heavy smoking. He made a recovery, several weeks after, and has since quit smoking.&lt;ref name=autobio/&gt;

In 1995, Newhart was one of several investors who bought a [[radio station]] in [[Santa Barbara, California]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC-YB/1996/B-AL-MT-BC-YB-1996.pdf [[Broadcasting &amp; Cable|Broadcasting &amp; Cable Yearbook]] 1996 page B-58 - retrieved 5/2/2018]&lt;/ref&gt;  The station played [[adult standards]] and its [[call sign|call letter]]s ended in Newhart's initials, [[AM 1290]] KZ'''BN'''.  In 2005, Newhart's group sold the station.  It is now [[KZSB]], the radio voice of ''The [[Santa Barbara News-Press]]''.

Newhart was an early home-computer hobbyist, purchasing the [[Commodore PET]] after its 1977 introduction. He wrote in 2001, "Later, I moved up to the 64 KB model and thought that was silly because it was more memory than I would ever possibly need."&lt;ref name="colker20010809"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/aug/09/news/tt-32244 | title=Happy Birthday PC! | work=Los Angeles Times | date=August 9, 2001 | accessdate=January 9, 2015 | author=Colker, David}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newhart sold his [[Wallace Neff]]-designed [[Bel Air, Los Angeles|Bel Air]] mansion to Canadian Robert Quigg in May 2016 for $14.5&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/realestate/hot-property/la-fi-hp-top-sales-20160528-snap-story.html |title=Funnyman Bob Newhart exits Bel-Air with $14.5-million deal, and other top sales |date=May 2016 |newspaper=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;
