In November 2009, Mo'Nique said, "I own the rights to [[Hattie McDaniel]]'s life story, and I can't wait to tell that story because that woman was absolutely amazing. She had to stand up to the adversity of black and white [society] at a time when we really weren't accepted. Mr. Lee Daniels is going to direct it, of course, and I'm going to be Miss Hattie McDaniel. I really hope I can do that woman justice."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Ben|last2=Walters|author2-link=|title=Comic Mo'Nique takes dramatic turn in "Precious"|magazine=The Hollywood Reporter / Reuters|date=2009-11-15|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE5AF0LV20091116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It mainly aired on these stations that had a local lineup because some Radio One stations did not carry it due to their contracts with Michael Baisden. The show lasted until March 18, 2009 when Mo'Nique decided to leave to "further her career in television, film, and comedy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.radio-online.com/cgi-bin/$rol.exe/headline_id=n19041 |title=Syndicated Personality Mo'Nique to End ''Mo'Nique Show'' |publisher=Radio Online |accessdate=March 24, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090317214021/http://news.radio-online.com/cgi-bin/%24rol.exe/headline_id%3Dn19041 |archivedate=March 17, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
[[File:82nd Academy Awards, Mo'Nique and Sidney Hicks.jpg|right|thumb|Mo'Nique and husband Sidney Hicks attending the [[82nd Academy Awards]]]]
Mo'Nique was briefly engaged to accountant Kenny Mung.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1355/is_21_102/ai_94161427|publisher = JET Magazine|date = November 11, 2002|title = Actress and comedienne Mo'Nique of the Parkers talks about her: career new book `Skinny Women are Evil' new fiance|last = Yarbrough | first = Marti}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1997 to 2001, she was married to Mark Jackson. They have a son named Shalon Jackson.

Mo'Nique gave birth to twin sons Jonathan and David Hicks in October 2005, two months early.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,1115775,00.html|title=Mo'Nique a New Mom Again – of Twins|work=PEOPLE.com|accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, she married their father Sidney Hicks. In a ''[[New York Times]]'' profile, she mentions that she and Hicks have an [[open marriage]]:

{{quote|We have an agreement that we'll always be honest, and if sex happens with another person, that's not a {{sic|deal break|er|hide=y}} for us, that's not something where we'll have to say, 'Oh God, we've got to go to divorce court because you cheated on me.' Because we don't cheat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9407E3D6103EF936A3575BC0A9619C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=2|title=Luckily, There's Plenty of Her for Everybody|last=Lee|first=Felicia R.|date=2007-08-05|publisher=''New York Times''|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

She repeated this view later on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' when she said that, in her prior marriages, she was constantly searching for "that extra oomph".&lt;ref name= Oprah&gt;Sheri Salata (Producer). (Jan 28, 2008). ''The Oprah Winfrey Show''. Chicago: Harpo Productions, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Mo'Nique explained, 

&lt;blockquote&gt;When I said I had an open marriage, people automatically jumped to sex. They automatically went there. But I've been best friends with my husband since we were 14 years old. When we say open, we're very honest. There are no secrets. Oftentimes you have people that are married, but they're strangers, and we refuse to be those people.&lt;ref name= Oprahweb&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080131132627/http://www2.oprah.com/tows/slide/200801/20080128/slide_20080128_350_206.jhtml | archivedate = 2008-01-31| url= http://www2.oprah.com/tows/slide/200801/20080128/slide_20080128_350_206.jhtml|publisher= Oprah.com|title = Mo'Nique on her open marriage.|accessdate= January 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

She concluded, "I've had to sneak and I've had to lie, and I don't want to do that any more. But my husband is so awesome and so fine and so—oh, girl...No other man can compare".&lt;ref name=Oprahweb/&gt;
