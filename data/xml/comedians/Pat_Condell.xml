'''Patrick Condell''' (born 23 November 1949)&lt;ref name="time-out-london" /&gt; is a writer, polemicist, and former [[stand-up comedy|stand-up comedian]]. In his early career he wrote and performed in [[alternative comedy]] shows during the 1980s and 1990s in London, winning the [[Time Out Comedy Awards|Time Out Comedy Award]] in 1991. He was also formerly a regular panelist on [[BBC Radio 1]]'s ''Loose Talk'' programme.

In early 2007 he began uploading on to the [[internet]] short filmed [[monologue]] [[polemic]]s primarily about religious authority, [[authoritarianism]] in government and [[left-wing politics]], and the societal effects of [[Muslim]] immigration into Europe, which have featured on the front pages of websites such as [[YouTube]] and [[LiveLeak]]. They have also been published on DVD, and also as a book of video transcripts. As of June 2017 Condell's YouTube channel has over a third of a million subscribers, with over 70 million views.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/patcondell/about|title=Pat Condell|last=|first=|date=|website=YouTube|access-date=26 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Condell was born in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]&lt;ref name="Pat_Condell_20100817_video"&gt;{{cite video |people=Pat Condell |date=17 August 2010 |title=An Irish joke |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZmxMlSTETo |publisher=YouTube |time=1:08 |quote=I was born in Ireland |accessdate=20 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and raised in England as a [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]].&lt;ref name="time-out-london"&gt;{{cite web |last=Hay |first=Malcolm |title=Pat Condell: interview |publisher=Time Out London |date=3 November 2006 |url=http://www.timeout.com/london/comedy/pat-condell-interview |accessdate=20 August 2010|quote=Condell’s 56. He was born an [[Irish Catholic]] but educated in [[Church of England]] schools.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His father was a [[Problem gambling|compulsive gambler]] working in a betting shop until he was sent to prison for stealing money; he then died of [[leukaemia]].&lt;ref name="time-out-london" /&gt; The Condell family in consequence was impoverished, moving repeatedly from home to home.

He was educated in several different Church of England schools in [[South London]]; saying of this time: "I found myself segregated in assembly and shunted into another room while everyone said their morning prayers. The whole pantomime seemed hollow to me even then. Once you become aware of the gulf between what people profess to believe and how they actually behave, it’s hard to take any of it seriously."&lt;ref name="time-out-london"/&gt;

Condell left school at 16, his first job being a dish-washer in the revolving restaurant on top of the Post Office Tower, now known as the [[BT Tower]] in London, for five shillings an hour.&lt;ref name="patcondell9" /&gt;  He became a [[vegetarian]] in 1976 after watching a deer being butchered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Comedy==
Condell performed [[alternative comedy]] shows during the 1980s and 1990s in the United Kingdom.  His first performance on stage was at the age of 32 in a [[sketch comedy|comedy sketch]] called ''Mountbatten’s Plimsoll''.&lt;ref name="comedy-and-me" /&gt;&lt;ref name="time-out-london" /&gt; He also wrote poetry and appeared in the ''Poetry Olympics'' at the [[Young Vic Theatre]] in 1982,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which led to a job writing weekly poems for the ''[[Time Out (company)|Time Out]]'' magazine. Condell was described at the time as "a manic gimlet-eyed, crop-haired poet" in  ''Drama: The Quarterly Theatre Review book''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Drama: The Quarterly Theatre Review |year=1981 |publisher=British Theatre Association  |isbn= |page=34 |oclc= 297266816 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He then performed on the London alternative comedy circuit for several years (originally under the name Eddie Zibin).&lt;ref name="comedy-and-me"&gt;{{cite web

| title = Comedy and Me
| publisher =patcondell.net

| accessdate =11 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also performed at the Tunnel Club, next to the [[Blackwall Tunnel]], where he describes  the audience as a "nightmare;" bottles and glasses were thrown at him, and one person attempted to cut the [[microphone]] lead with a pair of garden shears. Condell was a performer at [[The Comedy Store, London|The Comedy Store]] in the Cutting Edge team,&lt;ref name="time-out-london" /&gt; with whom he performed at the [[Edinburgh Fringe]] in 1991.&lt;ref name="glasgowshow"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://special.lib.gla.ac.uk/sta/search/detaile.cfm?EID=23884 | title = STA Catalogue&amp;nbsp;– Event Details | accessdate = 16 March 2009 | publisher = [[University of Glasgow]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1991 to 1994 Condell was a regular panellist on BBC Radio 1's "Loose Talk." &lt;ref name="telegraphcensor" /&gt; During the mid-1990s, he was performing over 200 times a year. Due to the late nights and regular travelling he decided to start writing for other comedians, while still doing the occasional performance.&lt;ref name="time-out-london" /&gt; In 1991 he performed comedy sketches at [[Duke of York's Theatre]], which were released onto VHS as ''Barf Bites Back!'' (1991).&lt;ref name="barfbite"&gt;{{cite web

Condell's 1996 play ''Barry Sorts It Out'' was given a negative review in the ''[[Financial Times]]'', which described it as "a sordid East End comedy" which "repeats ''ad nauseam'' the same gag."  The reviewer concluded that it is "a play with all the bite of a set of joke-shop fangs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

His 2006 stand-up show ''Faith Hope and Sanity'', subtitled "A Few Jokes About Religion Before It Kills Us All," was a platform for his comedy and atheist beliefs. "This is the first time I’ve set out to write a show in order to say something, rather than just as a vehicle for stand-up" he said of the show.&lt;ref name="time-out-london" /&gt; He performed the show at London’s [[Etcetera Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

''Chortle'' concluded that "Condell is still going through the motions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Politics===
In April 2010, Pat Condell urged his viewers to vote "for freedom" and said that a "vote for any of the three main parties" would be a wasted vote in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 general election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krybvOx-8Dk|title=Vote small, think big|first=Pat|last=Condell|date=24 April 2010|time=1:19 and 6:38|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=6 August 2010|quote=Personally, I'll be voting for the UK Independence Party ... a vote for any of the three main parties is ... a wasted vote}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same day [[United Kingdom Independence Party]] (UKIP) said that Condell "urges voters to shun the three old parties and vote UKIP".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukip.org/content/video-zone/1572-vote-small-think-big-says-pat-condell|title=Vote small, think big says Pat Condell|date=25 April 2010|publisher=[[UK Independence Party]]|accessdate=25 April 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100429000727/http://www.ukip.org/content/video-zone/1572-vote-small-think-big-says-pat-condell|archive-date=29 April 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LTKzg1K7Es|title=Hello angry atheists|first=Pat|last=Condell|date=3 May 2010|time=01:30|quote=some people ... missed the point of the video, which was to encourage people to vote for someone who actually shares their values|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=6 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a video titled "Vote small, think big", uploaded a fortnight before the 2010 UK general elections, and on his website, Pat Condell expressed support for the policies of the UK Independence Party.&lt;ref name="patcondell9"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patcondell.net/faqs/ |title=FAQ |publisher=Patcondell.net |date=27 February 2008 |accessdate=13 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ukip.org/content/video-zone/1572-vote-small-think-big-says-pat-condell |title=Vote small, think big says Pat Condell – UK Independence Party |publisher=Ukip.org |date=25 April 2010 |accessdate=13 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225031225/http://www.ukip.org/content/video-zone/1572-vote-small-think-big-says-pat-condell |archive-date=25 February 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Atheism===
Richard Dawkins, author of ''[[The God Delusion]]'', said of Condell that "Pat Condell is unique. Nobody can match his extraordinary blend of suavity and savagery. With his articulate intelligence he runs rings around the religious [[wingnut (politics)|wingnuts]] that are the targets of his merciless humour. Thank goodness he is on our side".&lt;ref name="dawkinsdvd" /&gt; In 2008, Dawkins's website released a collection of Condell's monologues on DVD, titled ''Pat Condell: Anthology''.&lt;ref name="dawkinsdvd"&gt;{{Cite web

In 2007 he was criticised by Christian author [[Dinesh D'Souza]] on ''[[AOL]] News'', who said "If the televangelists are guilty of producing some simple-minded, self-righteous Christians, then the atheist authors are guilty of producing self-congratulatory buffoons like Condell."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===''No Mosque at Ground Zero''===
{{See also|Park51}}
Condell has been resolute and outspoken in his opposition to the development of [[Park51]], near the site of 11 September 2001 [[September 11, 2001 attacks|World Trade Center attack]], in lower Manhattan. On 4 June 2010, he released a video titled "No Mosque at Ground Zero", in which he said that it was representative of Islamic triumphalism and that the United States would soon be on the verge of Islamization and have its freedoms trimmed, as Europe has.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| accessdate =13 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video has attracted 6 million views since it was uploaded. Speaking on why he believes the Mosque is offensive, Pat Condell stated:

:"To describe it as they have as a tribute to the victims is beyond bad taste, and shows a profound contempt for those who died. It would be hard to find a more provocative gesture short of standing on their graves and burning the American flag. Yet how typical of Islam, with its own hair trigger sensitivity to the slightest imagined insult, to do something so arrogant and insensitive."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| accessdate =13 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Condell cast some doubt over the funding of the community centre, and claimed that Islam would have been banned in the civilised world if it wasn't for the fact it was a religion. He compared the system of Sharia and the Muslims who endorse it to [[Nazi Germany]]. The video was among the top 10 most discussed YouTube videos of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2010/12/21/angry-redheads-rant-is-most-discussed-youtube-video-of-2010-620678/|title=Angry redhead’s rant is most discussed YouTube video of 2010|publisher=[[Metro.co.uk]]|accessdate=10 February 2018|date=21 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Trouble with Islam'' reaction===
[[File:The trouble with Islam.ogv|thumb|right|250px|''The Trouble with Islam'']]
{{see also|Counter-jihad}}

Condell also received criticism after links to his monologue titled ''The Trouble with Islam'', were circulated to commissioners in the California city of [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]]'s Peace and Justice Commission. Condell said in the video that Islam is "a religion of war", that "Muslim women in Britain who cover their faces are mentally ill", though in some parts of the world women have no choice but to cover their face, as they are "governed...by primitive pigs whose only achievement in life is to be born with a penis in one hand and a [[Qur'an]] in the other". Commissioner Elliot Cohen described Condell's comments as "insulting, degenerating and racist".&lt;ref name="chortle1"&gt;{{cite web
| title = Comic in US 'hate speech' row
| publisher =Chortle

| accessdate =22 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Condell then accused Cohen of being "motivated by his own narrow personal and political agenda which has nothing to do with [Condell] or the video clip". The video was initially sent to them by fellow Peace and Justice Commissioner Jonathan Wornick, who said it "tries to expose intolerance in the [[Muslim world]]", such as "the intolerance of [[Islamism|radical Islamists]] who say if you insult Allah, you should have your head cut off".&lt;ref name="berekely2"&gt;{{cite web

===YouTube censorship===
{{See also|Criticism of Google#YouTube}}
Condell's video ''Welcome to Saudi Britain'' was removed by YouTube early in October 2008, but reinstated shortly after. In it Condell criticises Britain's sanctioning of a [[Sharia]] court, and refers to the entire country of [[Saudi Arabia]] as "mentally ill" for [[Women's rights in Saudi Arabia|its abuse of women]].&lt;ref name="telegraphcensor" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rdcensor" /&gt;

A YouTube spokesman said "YouTube has clear policies that prohibit inappropriate content on the site, such as pornography, gratuitous violence or hate speech.... If users repeatedly break these rules we disable their accounts." The [[National Secular Society]] was among the complainants to YouTube, saying "as usual, he (Condell) does not mince his words, but he is not saying anything that is untrue. His main thrust is one of outrage on behalf of those Muslim women who will suffer because they are forced to have their marital problems solved in a male-dominated Sharia court."&lt;ref name="telegraphcensor"&gt;{{cite web

| accessdate =16 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after, YouTube reversed their earlier decision saying "Upon further review of the context of Pat Condell's comments, we've reinstated it." [[Richard Dawkins]] applauded the reversal, saying "I congratulate YouTube on an excellent decision. Pat Condell is hard-hitting, but always quietly reasonable in tone."&lt;ref name="rdcensor"&gt;{{cite web
