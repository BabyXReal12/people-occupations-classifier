'''Bruce Ian McCulloch''' (born May 12, 1961) is a Canadian actor, comedian, writer, musician and film director. McCulloch is best known for his work as a member of ''[[The Kids in the Hall]]'', a popular Canadian comedy troupe, and as a writer for ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. McCulloch has also appeared on series such as ''[[Twitch City]]'' and ''[[Gilmore Girls]]''. He directed the films ''[[Dog Park (film)|Dog Park]]'', ''[[Stealing Harvard]]'' and ''[[Superstar (1999 film)|Superstar]]''.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9802E1D81231F93BA35753C1A96F958260|title=Superstar (1999) FILM REVIEW; The Things She'll Do For Fame and a Date|first=Anita|last=Gates|date=October 8, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has also written and directed the romantic comedy ''Comeback Season'' which toured film festivals before its release on DVD in 2007. He was the writer of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Carpoolers]]''.

== Early life ==
McCulloch was born in [[Edmonton]], Alberta. He attended Strathcona Composite High School in Edmonton and competed in both track-and-field and swimming, winning two individual provincial titles. McCulloch is a graduate of [[Mount Royal College]] located in [[Calgary]], Alberta.

== Career ==

=== The Kids in the Hall ===
As a member of ''[[The Kids in the Hall]]'' comedy troupe, McCulloch frequently wrote surreal monologues, films and songs. He also directed several of the filmed sketches. Memorable characters included the Flying Pig, Cabbage Head, talkative schoolchild Gavin, pop starlet Tammy, secretary Kathie, and grumpy middle-aged man Gordon.

McCulloch appeared in ''The Kids in the Hall'' movie ''[[Brain Candy]]'', released in 1996. McCulloch drew controversy with his Cancer Boy character, introduced on the series' final episode, in which he plays a dying young cancer patient using wheelchair who relates otherwise depressing news, in monotone,  with a cheerful smile, and even releases a hit single entitled "Whistle When You're Low." [[Paramount Pictures]] fought to edit out the offending scenes{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}, yet they were still kept in. Among other characters, McCulloch also appeared as Grivo, a depressed rock star.

He co-wrote, starred in, and was executive producer of the Kids in the Hall 2010 reunion project ''[[Death Comes to Town]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xtra.ca/public/National/Nothing_is_sacred_in_new_Kids_in_the_Hall_series-8055.aspx "Nothing is sacred in new Kids in the Hall series"]. ''[[Xtra!]]'', December 28, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Music ===
McCulloch has released two albums: 1995’s ''[[Shame-Based Man]]'' produced by [[Bob Wiseman]], (praised by [[Allmusic]] as the "most remarkable of comedy albums: one that bears (frequent) repeated listenings”)&lt;ref&gt;{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r240429/review|pure_url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2002's ''[[Drunk Baby Project]]''.

McCulloch also directed the music video for the [[Tragically Hip]]'s song "[[My Music at Work]]," for which he won the award of "[[List of MuchMusic Video Award winners for Best Director|Best Director]]" at the 2000 [[MuchMusic Video Awards]]. McCulloch was close friends with Tragically Hip frontman [[Gord Downie]]. The video shares much in common with many ''The Kids in the Hall'' sketches, including its office setting, camera angles, and some thematic elements.  McCulloch also starred in and co-directed the music video for 1997's "Make You Mad" by Canadian band The Odds.

=== Movies ===
McCulloch played Fred Wright in the 1987 TV mini-series ''[[Anne of Avonlea (1987 film)|Anne of Avonlea]]''. He also had a role in the 1999 comedy film ''[[Dick (film)|Dick]]''.

McCulloch also co-wrote and had a bit part in ''Superman's 50th Anniversary: A Celebration of the Man of Steel'' (1988). In the [[CBS]] prime-time special, (also featuring [[Dana Carvey]], [[Al Franken]], [[Jan Hooks]], and others) he played a patron of a store that, among other things, sold counterfeit [[Kryptonite]]. He also played a Canadian Mounted Police Officer in the movie, Super Troopers 2.

===Television===
He also played the judge in "To Kill a Chupacabraj" in Season 3 of ''[[Workaholics]]'', Father Marsala in season 4 of ''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]]'', and Tobin on ''[[Gilmore Girls]]''. He created and stars in the sitcom ''[[Young Drunk Punk]]'', which debuted in 2015, and wrote and plays a small part in the 2018 web series ''[[This Blows]]''.
