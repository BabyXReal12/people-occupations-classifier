'''Tim Moore''' (December 9, 1887 – December 13, 1958) was an American vaudevillian and comic actor of the first half of the 20th century. He gained his greatest recognition in the starring role of George "Kingfish" Stevens in the [[CBS]] TV's ''[[Amos 'n' Andy#Television|The Amos 'n' Andy Show]]''. He proudly stated, "I've made it a point never to tell a joke on stage that I couldn't tell in front of my mother."&lt;ref name="Married"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Oqw7AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=6SkMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3178,18595996&amp;dq=tim+moore&amp;hl=en|title=Played Best Theatres Of The World|author=Johnson, Lillian|date=February 22, 1941|publisher=The Afro-American|accessdate=October 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Early years===
Moore was born '''Harry Roscoe Moore''' in [[Rock Island, Illinois]], one of 13 children of Harry and Cynthia Moore.&lt;ref name="Married"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-4gDh277r_J4/TZzPaV_bmvI/AAAAAAAABD0/ozhyDH9GXM0/s1600/Picture+1345.jpg|title=Photo of Tim Moore with his parents and six of his seven brothers|date=August 13, 1995|publisher=Rock Island Argus|accessdate=June 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was a night watchman at a brewery. Tim Moore dropped out of grammar school to work at odd jobs in town and even danced for pennies in the streets with his friend, Romeo Washburn.&lt;ref name=Library/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tim"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blackpast.org/?q=aah/moore-tim-1888-1958|title=Tim Moore|publisher=BlackPast.org|accessdate=October 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1898, Moore and Washburn went into [[vaudeville]] in an act called "Cora Miskel and Her Gold Dust Twins." It was booked by agents and travelled through the United States and even Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://black-face.com/Tim-Moore.htm|title=Tim Moore|publisher=Black-face.com|accessdate=September 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yodaslair.com/dumboozle/tmoore/golddust.html|title=Tim Moore: The Gold Dust Twins|publisher=Yoda'sLair.com|accessdate=November 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fultonhistory.com/Process%20small/Newspapers/New%20York%20NY%20Clipper%201853%20-%201924/New%20York%20NY%20Clipper%201904-1905.pdf/New%20York%20NY%20Clipper%201904-1905%20-%200133.pdf|title=New York City-(Brooklyn)-Fulton Street Theater|date=April 2, 1904|publisher=The New York Clipper|accessdate=June 12, 2011}} ([[PDF]])&lt;/ref&gt; By 1904, the act had performed with the [[Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus|Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fultonhistory.com/Process%20Small/Newspapers/New%20York%20NY%20Clipper%201853%20-%201924/New%20York%20NY%20Clipper%201904-1905.pdf/New%20York%20NY%20Clipper%201904-1905%20-%200817.pdf#xml=http://www.fultonhistory.com/dtSearch/dtisapi6.dll?cmd=getpdfhits&amp;u=fffffffff50ceeeb&amp;DocId=11210787&amp;Index=Z%3a%2fFulton%20Historical&amp;HitCount=2&amp;hits=13bf+13c0+&amp;SearchForm=C%3a%5cinetpub%5cwwwroot%5cFulton%5fNew%5fform%2ehtml&amp;.pdf|title=Vaudeville and Minstrel|date=October 22, 1904|publisher=The New York Clipper|accessdate=June 12, 2011}} ([[PDF]])&lt;/ref&gt;  As Moore and Washburn grew older, the act became less effective and Miss Miskel sent them back to their parents in Rock Island. Shortly after this, Moore joined the medicine show of "Doctor Mick" (Charles S. Mick), who sold a patented [[quackery|quack]] remedy called ''Pru-ri-ta''. Doctor Mick travelled through the Midwestern states, with songs and dances provided by Moore and four [[Kickapoo people|Kickapoo]] Indians.&lt;ref name=Library/&gt;&lt;ref name="Yoda"/&gt; The young man also worked in a carnival [[sideshow]] and gave guided tours as a "native" tour guide in Hawaii.&lt;ref name=Library/&gt;

===Boxing and vaudeville years===

Moore left Doctor Mick, first to become a [[stableboy]] and later a jockey.

Subsequently, he went on tour as one of the stars of producer Edward E. Daley's "black and white musical comedy sensation", ''Rarin' to Go'', for three seasons on the Columbia Burlesque Wheel (1925, 1926 and 1927 editions).

===Broadway comedian===
In June 1925, Tim Moore made his Broadway debut as the star of ''Lucky Sambo'' (based on "Aces and Queens'). However, the show closed after only a few performances. He was a success in burlesque in the mid 1920s with the hit show ''Rarin' to Go'', followed by a return to vaudeville in 1927 with ''The Southland Revue''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=95BXAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=f0QNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2871,1601721&amp;dq=tim+moore&amp;hl=en|title=Rarin' To Go|publisher=The Toledo News-Bee|date=6 September 1926|accessdate=21 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moore wrote all of his own material and also did some writing for other performers; a Moore skit called, ''Not a Fit Night for Man nor Beast'', was bought by [[W.C. Fields]].&lt;ref name=Library/&gt;&lt;ref name="Registry"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Harlem"/&gt; He also did some writing for the radio show of the [[Two Black Crows]] comedy team.

In 1928, Moore took time off from his vaudeville bookings to try his luck once more on the Great White Way – [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]].

===Television stardom===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:AmosAndy.jpg|left|250px|thumb|[[Alvin Childress]], Tim Moore, and [[Spencer Williams]] in a CBS publicity shot for the program, 1951.]] --&gt;
In 1950, Moore was recommended by his old vaudeville friend, [[Flournoy Miller]], for the role of George "Kingfish" Stevens, a role which was voiced on radio by white actor [[Freeman Gosden]].&lt;ref name="Harlem"/&gt;  He was called out of retirement by the [[Columbia Broadcasting System]] to star in a new television adaptation of ''[[Amos 'n' Andy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=jncxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Yn0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3569,1199892&amp;dq=freeman+gosden&amp;hl=en|title=Amos And Andy Name Subs For Television Roles|date=June 18, 1951|publisher=St. Petersburg Times|accessdate=October 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZCNWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=u-IDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6812,6572779&amp;dq=spencer+williams&amp;hl=en|title=Radio's Veteran Comics Smash Hit on Television|date=April 14, 1954|publisher=Eugene Register-Guard|accessdate=March 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the radio series had developed in prior years, the scheming but henpecked Kingfish had become the central focus of most of the plots. In the television version, Moore played the character more broadly, with louder and more forceful delivery and a distinctive Georgia drawl, exaggerated for comic effect. Moore's Kingfish dominated the calmer and soft-spoken "Amos 'n' Andy" characters. Early in his career, Moore had developed a "con-man" routine he used for many years while in vaudeville; re-working some aspects of his old act produced the television character Kingfish.&lt;ref name="Harlem"/&gt;

Moore was very popular in the show and for the first time in his career became a national celebrity as well as the first African American to win stardom on television. When leaving a train in Albuquerque to buy some Native American pottery, the proprietor recognized him immediately, saying, "You, you Kingfish." This was the first time it happened in Moore's 52 years in show business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=4ccKAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=hU8DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3384,3553696&amp;dq=tim+moore&amp;hl=en|title=The Lyons Den|author=Lyons, Leonard|date=August 11, 1951|publisher=St. Petersburg Times|accessdate=October 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show aired on prime-time TV from June 1951 to June 1953. Although quite popular, the series was eventually canceled due to complaints about ethnic stereotyping. Shortly after the television show left the air, there were plans to turn it into a vaudeville act in August 1953, with Moore, Williams, and Childress playing the same characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=i3ZGAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=fuUMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2121,173955&amp;dq=spencer+williams&amp;hl=en|title='Amos 'n' Andy' Set for Vaude|date=August 4, 1953|publisher=Baltimore Afro-American|accessdate=April 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is not known if this was ever realized. After the series was canceled, it was shown in [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] until 1966 when increasing condemnation and pressure from the NAACP persuaded the show's owners (CBS, which still owns the copyrights) to withdraw it from further exhibition.  It was resurrected in the early days of home videotape through [[public domain video dealers]] who had acquired episodes from collectors of used 16mm TV prints, although the copyright was never in the public domain. Illegally produced copies continue to be sold over the internet.  The series itself would not be seen on a regular basis again until independent network Rejoice TV began re-airing episodes in 2012.

Many of the episodes revolved around Moore's Kingfish character, supported by [[Ernestine Wade]] as his level-headed, emotionally strong wife Sapphire, and [[Amanda Randolph]] as his openly aggressive mother-in-law, without the participation of Amos or Andy. These Kingfish-only episodes were originally produced as a spinoff series, ''[[The Adventures of Kingfish]]'', which made its debut on CBS on January 4, 1955 but lasted only a few episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SrIDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA60&amp;dq=tim+moore+intitle:jet&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=7XKyTPS8AZnLngfyw9nuBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwATgU#v=onepage&amp;q=tim%20moore%20intitle%3Ajet&amp;f=false|title=New 'Kingfish' Series To Make TV Debut Jan. 4|date=January 6, 1955|publisher=Jet|accessdate=October 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uV2gZKvQwR0C&amp;pg=PT223&amp;dq=ernestine+wade&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3fUzTf3zMMSp8Aa0vJD3CA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CFgQ6AEwCTgo#v=onepage&amp;q=ernestine%20wade&amp;f=false|title=Make 'Em Laugh: The Funny Business of America|editor-last=Kantor|editor-first=Michael|editor2-last=Maslon|editor2-first=Lawrence|year=2008|publisher=Twelve|pages=384|isbn=978-0-446-50531-4|accessdate=March 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When the ''Amos 'n' Andy'' half-hours went into syndication, the ''Adventures of Kingfish'' shows were added to the syndicated package under the ''Amos 'n' Andy'' series title.

In 1956, Moore and his fellow cast mates [[Spencer Williams (actor)|Spencer Williams]], [[Alvin Childress]] and [[Lillian Randolph]] with her choir, tried a tour of personal appearances as "The TV Stars of ''Amos 'n' Andy''".  The tour was halted by [[CBS]], who viewed this as infringing on their exclusivity.&lt;ref name="Tragedy"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4uK_KEF-KT8C&amp;pg=PA66&amp;dq=all+about+amos+'n'+andy&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=2FShTKjXEdP_nQfR7L2IBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=all%20about%20amos%20'n'%20andy&amp;f=false|title=The Tragedy of Amos 'n' Andy|author=Clayton, Edward T.|date=October 1961|publisher=Ebony|accessdate=September 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moore, and fellow cast members Williams, Childress and Lee, were able to perform for one night in 1957 in [[Windsor, Ontario]], since legal action had not been taken against them in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=BSM_AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=2k8MAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3663,3973138&amp;dq=spencer+williams&amp;hl=en|title=The Theatre and its People|author=Gardiner, John|date=June 25, 1957|publisher=The Windsor Daily Star|accessdate=March 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moore married his last wife Vivian Cravens (1912–1988) eight months after Benzonia's death; they had been performing as a comedy team for some time before marrying in 1957.&lt;ref name="Obit"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=

My wife protects them and every time we talk about it, we get into an argument. The argument got a little loud and the next thing I knew, the big boy (his stepson Hubbard) jumped out of his chair.  I ran upstairs and got out my old pistol.  I didn't want to hit anybody."&lt;ref name="Gun"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EbgDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA60&amp;dq=tim+moore+intitle:jet&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=V5XaTN_ICMqdnAe17s3eAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=tim%20moore%20intitle%3Ajet&amp;f=false|title=TV Kingfish and His Sapphire in Real-Life Domestic Brawl|date=January 16, 1958|publisher=Jet|accessdate=November 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the police arrived at the home, Moore, pistol still in his belt, told them, "I'm the old Kingfish, boys. I'm the one you want. I fired that shot. I didn't want to hit anyone, although I could have. Anyway, you should have seen the in-laws scatter when I fired that gun."&lt;ref name="Beef"/&gt; The shot Moore fired hit the china cabinet; he was arrested and charged with assault with a deadly weapon, with police calling him the "funniest prisoner in police history."&lt;ref name="Gun"/&gt; Moore was initially ordered held on $1,000 bond; the judge changed his mind and released Moore on his own recognizance.&lt;ref name="Beef"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/thedailymirror/2008/01/paul-coates-8.html|title=The Daily Mirror|date=January 29, 2008|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=December 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tim and his wife reconciled, with Vivian's pleading for the charges to be dropped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NbcDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA16&amp;dq=tim+moore&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=MJTaTJKqLIqfnAet3vzvBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=tim%20moore&amp;f=false|title=Kingfish Dismissal Plea Denied, 2 Make Up|date=January 30, 1958|publisher=Jet|accessdate=November 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sitcomsonline.com/photopost/showphoto.php/photo/65703/size/big/cat/792|title=Kingfish Arrested On Assault Charge|date=January 1958|publisher=Associated Press|accessdate=November 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moore entered a not guilty plea before the case went to trial on March 24.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FLcDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA60&amp;dq=tim+moore+intitle:jet&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=V5XaTN_ICMqdnAe17s3eAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=tim%20moore%20intitle%3Ajet&amp;f=false|title=Kingfish Pleads Not Guilty In Gun Fracas|date=February 27, 1958|publisher=Jet|accessdate=November 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He received a $100 fine and a year's probation as his sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cbcDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA62&amp;dq=tim+moore+intitle:jet&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=QJbaTO2qCsWOnwe40Z36Ag&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwCTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=tim%20moore%20intitle%3Ajet&amp;f=false|title=Kingfish Fined $100 For Roast Beef Fracas|date=April 10, 1958|publisher=Jet|accessdate=November 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the story broke, local television personality and columnist [[Paul Coates]] invited Tim Moore to appear on his [[KTTV]] television show; Moore explained the situation in two guest appearances. Coates was promptly taken to task for Moore's appearances on his show by Stanley Robertson, a journalist for the African-American newspaper, the ''[[Los Angeles Sentinel]]'', calling Moore "disgraceful" and labeling the two shows with Moore as "television's darkest hour." Coates replied to his critic in his January 29, 1958 ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' column, calling Moore "a pretty wonderful, sincere man" and saying he strongly resented Robertson's attack on him.&lt;ref name="Beef"/&gt;

Because of the "Roast Beef Scandal," Moore was once more in demand and even received a testimonial tribute dinner from the [[Friars Club of Beverly Hills]], and appearing on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' with [[Jack Paar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FLgDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA30&amp;dq=tim+moore+intitle:jet&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=7XKyTPS8AZnLngfyw9nuBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwADgU#v=onepage&amp;q=tim%20moore%20intitle%3Ajet&amp;f=false|title=Words Of The Week|date=January 23, 1958|publisher=Jet|accessdate=October 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The publicity also won him an extended performance engagement at the legendary [[Mocambo (nightclub)|Mocambo]] nightclub.&lt;ref name="Tim"/&gt;

===Death and legacy===
Moore died at age 71 on December 13, 1958 of [[pulmonary tuberculosis]] in Los Angeles, four days after his birthday.  There was no money to pay for his hospital care or for his funeral, Moore having received his final $65.00 residual payment from ''Amos 'n' Andy'' in January 1958.  At one time, Moore had made $700 per week.&lt;ref name="Married"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fEEDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA60&amp;dq=tim+moore+intitle:jet&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=_GyyTPaUGIyJnQeOreH7BQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=tim%20moore%20intitle%3Ajet&amp;f=false|title=Critically Ill, Kingfish Tells Wife Of Fears, Disappointments|date=December 18, 1958|publisher=Jet|accessdate=October 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=csMlAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=MfUFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=877%2C7527195|title=Kingfish Succumbs|date=December 16, 1958|publisher=Baltimore Afro-American|accessdate=November 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
