'''Nawaal Akram''' is a Qatari [[comedian]], model, athlete and disability rights campaigner. She was diagnosed with [[Duchenne muscular dystrophy]] at the age of six, and was forcefully removed from education against her wishes at the age of 10 by the school . she became [[wheelchair]]-bound at age of 12 . She has since founded Muscular Dystrophy Qatar to raise awareness of the condition, and was named one of [[BBC]]'s ''[[100 Women (BBC)|100 Women]]'' programme in 2017.

==Career==
Born in [[Doha]], [[Qatar]] to [[Pakistani]] parents,&lt;ref name=stero/&gt;&lt;ref name="happy"/&gt; Nawaal Akram is one of six children to Mohammed and Saima Akram. &lt;ref name="tribune"/&gt; At the age of six, she was diagnosed with [[Duchenne muscular dystrophy]], and was [[wheelchair]]-bound by the age of 12 after falling and breaking her leg.&lt;ref name="happy"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nangiana|first1=Umer|title="I love to make people happy"|url=http://www.gulf-times.com/story/432759/I-love-to-make-people-happy|accessdate=3 November 2017|work=Gulf Times|date=28 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her condition led to Akram being bullied by other children, which was ignored by the teachers in her school. Akram was then removed from her school, as they did not want to take responsibility for a physically disabled child. Her parents threatened to sue the school but withdrew as it would have affected the education of her siblings who were studying there. Applications to other schools followed, but these were rejected on the basis of her condition or nationality. Special schools were contacted, but she was rejected from those as she did not have a [[Mental disability (disambiguation)|mental disability]]. Akram eventually tried [[home school|homeschooling]], but this was ineffective as it used part-time tutors.&lt;ref name="love"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Perera|first1=Umanga|title=Nawaal Akram: Breaking stereotypes and changing narratives on disability|url=http://www.iloveqatar.net/news/content/nawaal-akram-breaking-stereotypes-and-changing-narratives-disability|publisher=I Love Qatar|accessdate=3 November 2017|date=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the lack of access to education, she began to feel [[depression (mood)|depressed]]. Akram started to work at Mada, a non-project disability organisation in Qatar. While there, she learnt about how [[social media]] can be used to promote ideas.&lt;ref name=stero&gt;{{cite news|last1=Scott|first1=Victoria|title=Qatar teen with muscular dystrophy breaks down stereotypes, one at a time|url=https://dohanews.co/qatar-teen-with-muscular-dystrophy-breaks-down-stereotypes-one-at-a-time/|accessdate=3 November 2017|work=Doha News|date=16 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

She has since performed stand up comedy as a [[comedian]] with Stand Up Comedy Qatar (SUCQ), the country's first and only collective of stand up comedians, that was started in November 2010.&lt;ref name="sucq"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Savodnik|first1=Peter|title="Yes, There Are Comedians in Qatar"|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/27/magazine/yes-there-are-comedians-in-qatar.html|accessdate=6 June 2018|work=New York Times|date=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Akram also works a [[Model (person)|model]]. 

Akram took up the [[Paralympic]] sport [[Boccia]], and expanded her social media presence including her [[YouTube]] channel "Nawaal's Adventures". In 2016, she founded the organisation Muscular Dystrophy Qatar to raise awareness of the condition within the country.&lt;ref name="love"/&gt; She was named one of [[BBC]]'s ''[[100 Women (BBC)|100 Women]]'' programme, signifying her as one of the most influential and inspiration women of the year.&lt;ref name="tribune"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kiel Lumanglas|first1=Marson|title=Qatar's Girl Conquers the World|url=http://www.qatar-tribune.com/PrintNews.aspx?id=89502|accessdate=3 November 2017|work=Qatar Tribune|date=11 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
