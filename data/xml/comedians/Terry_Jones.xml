'''Terence Graham Parry Jones''' (born 1 February 1942) is a Welsh actor, writer, comedian, screenwriter and film director.

He was a member of the [[Monty Python]] comedy troupe.

== Early life ==
Jones was born in the seaside town of [[Colwyn Bay]], on the north coast of [[Wales]]. The family home was named ''Bodchwil''. His father was stationed with the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] in [[India]]. When Jones was four-and-a-half, the family moved to [[Surrey]] in [[England]].&lt;ref name=life&gt;{{cite web|last=Bevan |first=Nathan |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/showbiz-and-lifestyle/arts-in-wales/2011/03/05/the-life-and-times-of-monty-python-s-terry-jones-91466-28274298/ |title=The life and times of Monty Python's Terry Jones by Nathan Bevan, Western Mail at |publisher=Walesonline.co.uk |date=5 March 2011 |accessdate=1 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jones attended primary school at Esher COE school and later attended the [[Royal Grammar School, Guildford|Royal Grammar School]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rgs-guildford.co.uk/page_viewer.asp?page=Terry+Jones&amp;pid=355 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091130215156/http://www.rgs-guildford.co.uk/page_viewer.asp?page=Terry+Jones&amp;pid=355 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=30 November 2009 |title=Distinguished Old Guildfordians – Terry Jones |work=Royal Grammar School, Guildford Website |accessdate=9 February 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Guildford]], where he was school captain in the 1960–61 academic year. He read English at [[St Edmund Hall, Oxford]], but "strayed into history".&lt;ref name="english"&gt;Roger Wilmut, From Fringe to Flying Circus, London, 1980, p.38; {{cite web|url=http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/474/474005p1.html|work=IGN|title=An interview with Terry Jones|accessdate=29 June 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713004743/http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/474/474005p1.html|archivedate=13 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}. He became interested in the medieval period through reading Chaucer as part of his English degree.{{dead link|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated with a 2.1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxfordtoday.ox.ac.uk/2009-10/v22n2/06.shtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620231547/http://www.oxfordtoday.ox.ac.uk/2009-10/v22n2/06.shtml |dead-url=yes |archive-date=20 June 2010 |title="A Python's progress", Volume 22 Number 2, Hilary 2010 at |publisher=Oxfordtoday.ox.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=1 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; While there, he performed comedy with future Monty Python castmate [[Michael Palin]] in [[the Oxford Revue]].

== Career history ==

=== Before Python and early Python ===
Jones appeared in ''[[Twice a Fortnight]]'' with [[Michael Palin]], [[Graeme Garden]], [[Bill Oddie]] and [[Jonathan Lynn]], as well as the television series ''[[The Complete and Utter History of Britain]]'' (1969). He appeared in ''[[Do Not Adjust Your Set]]'' (1967–69) with Palin, [[Eric Idle]] and [[David Jason]]. He wrote for ''[[The Frost Report]]'' and several other [[David Frost]] programmes on British television. Along with Palin, he wrote lyrics for the 1968 Barry Booth album "Diversions".

Early on, Jones was interested in devising a fresh format for the Python TV shows, and it was largely he who developed the stream-of-consciousness style which abandoned punchlines and encouraged the fluid movement of one sketch into another, allowing the troupe's conceptual humour the space to "breathe". Jones took a keen interest in the direction of the show. As demonstrated in many of his sketches with Palin, Jones was interested in making comedy that was visually impressive, feeling that interesting settings augmented, rather than distracted from, the humour. His methods encouraged many future television comedians to break away from conventional studio-bound shooting styles, as demonstrated by shows such as ''[[Green Wing]]'', ''[[Little Britain]]'' and ''[[The League of Gentlemen]]''.

Of Jones' contributions as a performer, his depictions of middle-aged women are among the most memorable. His humour, in collaboration with Palin, tends to be conceptual in nature. A typical Palin/Jones sketch draws its humour from the absurdity of the scenario. For example, in the "Summarise Proust Competition", Jones plays a cheesy game show host who gives contestants 15 seconds to condense [[Marcel Proust]]'s lengthy work ''[[In Search of Lost Time|À la recherche du temps perdu]]''. Jones was also noted for his gifts as a [[Charlie Chaplin|Chaplinesque]] physical comedian. His performance in the "Undressing in Public" sketch, for instance, is done in total silence.

=== Directorial work ===
Jones co-directed ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]'' with [[Terry Gilliam]], and was sole director on two further Monty Python movies, ''[[Monty Python's Life of Brian|Life of Brian]]'' and ''[[Monty Python's The Meaning of Life]]''. As a film director, Jones finally gained fuller control of the projects and devised a visual style that complemented the humour. His later films include ''[[Erik the Viking]]'' (1989) and ''[[The Wind in the Willows (1996 film)|The Wind in the Willows]]'' (1996). In 2008, Jones wrote the libretto for and directed the opera ''Evil Machines''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Martin | first = Francesca | title = Ex-Python's opera rings the changes | newspaper=The Guardian | location = London | url = https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/jan/16/theatre3 | date = 16 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, he was commissioned to direct and write the libretto for another opera, entitled ''The Doctor's Tale''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Williams | first = Holly | title = Heads Up: Operashots | newspaper=The Independent | location = London | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/classical/features/heads-up-operashots-2226603.html | date = 27 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the commentary track of the 2004 "2 Disc Special Edition" DVD for the film ''Monty Python's The Meaning of Life'', Terry Jones stated that to his knowledge Ireland had at the time banned four movies, three of which he had directed: ''The Meaning of Life'', ''Monty Python's Life of Brian'' and ''[[Personal Services]]''.

Jones directed the 2015 comedy film ''[[Absolutely Anything]]'', about a disillusioned schoolteacher who is given the chance to do anything he wishes by a group of aliens watching from space.&lt;ref&gt;Gioia, Michael.

It was shot in [[London]] during a 6-week shoot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://filmdoctor.co.uk/2015/04/15/in-conversation-terry-jones-director-absolutely-anything-monty-python-and-the-holy-grail-life-of-brian-wind-in-the-willows/|title=In Conversation: Terry Jones (Director – Absolutely Anything, Monty Python and the Holy Grail, Life of Brian, Wind in the Willows)|work=Film Doctor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Writer ===

Jones has written many books and screenplays, including comic works and more serious writing on medieval history.

==== Comedy ====
Jones co-wrote ''[[Ripping Yarns]]'' with Palin. He has also written numerous works for children, including ''Fantastic Stories'', ''The Beast with a Thousand Teeth'', and a collection of comic verse called ''The Curse of the Vampire's Socks''.

Jones was also the co-creator (with [[Gavin Scott]]) of the [[animated]] TV series ''[[Blazing Dragons]]'' (1996–1998), which parodied the [[King Arthur|Arthurian]] legends and [[Middle Ages]] periods. Reversing a common story convention, the series' [[protagonists]] are [[anthropomorphic]] [[dragons]] beset by evil humans.

==== Screenplays ====
Jones wrote the screenplay for ''[[Labyrinth (film)|Labyrinth]]'' (1986), although his draft went through several rewrites and several other writers before being filmed; consequently, much of the finished film wasn't actually written by Jones.

==== History ====
Jones has written books and presented television documentaries on [[Middle Ages|medieval]] and [[Classical antiquity|ancient history]].

His first book was ''Chaucer's Knight: The Portrait of a Medieval Mercenary'' (1980), which offers an alternative take on [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Knight's Tale]]''. Chaucer's knight is often interpreted as a paragon of Christian virtue, but Jones asserts that if one studies historical accounts of the battles the knight claims he was involved in, he can be interpreted as a typical [[mercenary]] and a potentially cold-blooded killer. He also co-wrote ''Who Murdered Chaucer?'' (2003) in which he argues that Chaucer was close to King Richard the Second and that after Richard was deposed Chaucer was persecuted to death by [[Thomas Arundel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/nov/15/classics.highereducation|title=Review: Who Murdered Chaucer?|last=Myerson|first=Jonathan|date=15 November 2003|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jones's TV series also frequently challenge popular views of history. For example, ''[[Terry Jones' Medieval Lives]]'' (2004; for which he received a 2004 [[Emmy]] nomination for "Outstanding Writing for Nonfiction Programming") argues that the Middle Ages was a more sophisticated period than is popularly thought, and ''[[Terry Jones' Barbarians]]'' (2006) presents the cultural achievements of peoples conquered by the [[Roman Empire]] in a more positive light than Roman historians typically have, while criticising the Romans as the true "barbarians" who exploited and destroyed higher civilisations.

==== Anti–Iraq War writing ====
He wrote numerous editorials for ''[[The Guardian]], [[The Daily Telegraph]]'' and ''[[The Observer]]'' condemning the [[Iraq War]]. Many of these editorials were published in a paperback collection titled ''Terry Jones's War on the War on Terror''.

In November 2011 his book ''[[Evil Machines]]'' was launched by the online publishing house Unbound at the Adam Street Club in London. It was the first book to be published by a [[crowdfunding]] website dedicated solely to books{{cn|date=July 2018}}. Jones provided significant support to Unbound as they developed their publishing concept. In February 2018, Jones released his latest book ''The Tyrant and the Squire'', also with Unbound.

==== Poetry ====
He is also a member of the [[Poetry Society]], and his poems have appeared in ''[[Poetry Review]]''.

=== Working with musicians ===
Jones has performed with the [[The Carnival Band (folk group)|Carnival Band]] and appears on their 2007 CD ''Ringing the Changes'' (Park Records PRKCD98).

In January 2008, the Teatro São Luiz, in [[Lisbon]], Portugal, premiered ''Evil Machines'' – a musical play, written by Jones (based on his book) and with original music by [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] composer Luis Tinoco. Jones was invited by the Teatro São Luiz to write and direct the play, after a very successful run of ''Contos Fantásticos'', a short play based on Jones' Fantastic Stories, also with music by Luis Tinoco.

In January 2012, it was announced that Jones was working with songwriter/producer [[Jim Steinman]] on a heavy metal version of ''[[The Nutcracker]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Website featuring Canadian doctor, Monty Python pal blends humour, health advice |date=19 January 2012 |work=ca.news.yahoo.com |url=http://ca.news.yahoo.com/website-featuring-canadian-doctor-monty-python-pal-blends-215901908.html |accessdate=23 January 2012}}{{dead link|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== As performer ===
Apart from a cameo in [[Terry Gilliam]]'s ''[[Jabberwocky (film)|Jabberwocky]]'' and a memorable minor role as a drunken vicar in BBC sitcom ''[[The Young Ones (TV series)|The Young Ones]]'', Jones has rarely appeared in work outside his own projects. From 2009 to 2011, however, he provided narration for ''[[The Legend of Dick and Dom]]'', a [[CBBC]] fantasy series set in the Middle Ages. He also appears in two [[French language|French]] films by [[Albert Dupontel]]: ''[[The Creator (film)|Le Créateur]]'' (1999) and ''[[Enfermés dehors]]'' (2006).

In 2009 Jones took part in the [[BBC Wales]] programme ''[[Coming Home (UK TV series)|Coming Home]]'' about his Welsh family history.

On 2 October 2016 Jones received a standing ovation at the [[BAFTA Cymru]] Awards when he received a Lifetime Achievement award for his outstanding contribution to television and film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/culture/video/2016/oct/03/monty-python-star-terry-jones-and-son-tearful-at-bafta-ceremony-video|title=Monty Python star Terry Jones and son tearful at Bafta ceremony – video|first=Source:|last=Bafta|date=3 October 2016|publisher=|via=www.theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/av/uk-wales-37537212/bafta-cymru-award-an-honour-for-terry-jones-says-son|title=Bafta award an 'honour' for Terry Jones|date=3 October 2016|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Jones married Alison Telfer in 1970, and they have two children together, Sally (born in 1974), and Bill (born in 1976). Jones left her for Anna Söderström, and their daughter Siri was born in early September 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/celebritynews/6239693/Monty-Python-star-Terry-Jones-introduces-baby-Siri.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=Monty Python star Terry Jones introduces baby Siri | first=Anita | last=Singh | date=28 September 2009 | accessdate=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Jones was diagnosed with [[primary progressive aphasia]], a form of [[frontotemporal dementia]] that impairs the ability to speak and communicate. By September 2016, he was no longer able to give interviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

== Political views ==
Jones has published a number of articles on political and social commentary, principally in newspapers ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', ''[[The Guardian]]'', ''[[The Independent]]'', and ''[[The Observer]]''. Many of these articles criticised the [[War on Terror]], belittling it as "declaring war on an abstract noun" and comparing it to attempting to "annihilate mockery".&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Terry. [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1364012/Why-grammar-is-the-first-casualty-of-war.html "Why grammar is the first casualty of war"] ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' 1 December 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2014, Jones was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to ''[[The Guardian]]'' expressing their hope that Scotland would vote to remain part of the United Kingdom in September's [[Scottish independence referendum, 2014|referendum on that issue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/aug/07/celebrities-open-letter-scotland-independence-full-text |title=Celebrities' open letter to Scotland – full text and list of signatories |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=7 August 2014 |accessdate=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
