'''Robert George "Bob" Schimmel''' (January 16, 1950 – September 3, 2010) was an American comedian who was known for his controversial [[blue comedy]].&lt;ref name="nytobit"&gt;Wilson, Eric (September 4, 2010). [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/05/arts/television/05schimmel.html Robert Schimmel, 60, Provocative Comic, Dies.] ''[[New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; While the extremely profane nature of his act limited his commercial appeal, he had a reputation as a "comic's comic" due to his relentless touring, comedy albums and frequent appearances on [[HBO]] and ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]''. Schimmel is number 76 on the 2004 program Comedy Central Presents: 100 Greatest Stand-Ups Of All Time.&lt;ref name="loughlin2007"&gt;Loughlin, Sean (November 22, 2007) Casino Scene. ''[[Press of Atlantic City]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==
Schimmel was born in the [[Bronx]], New York City, the son of Betty and Otto Schimmel, [[Jew]]ish survivors of the [[Holocaust]].&lt;ref name="bickley1999"&gt;Bickley, Tami (October 8, 1999). [http://www.jewishaz.com/jewishnews/991008/comic.shtml "Behind the act, comic says he's 'just a regular guy'."] ''Jewish News of Greater Phoenix''  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814035914/http://www.jewishaz.com/jewishnews/991008/comic.shtml |date=August 14, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was voted class clown during high school and was in the [[United States Air Force]] for one year during the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name="beggy2002"&gt;Beggy &amp; Stoughton (November 16, 2002). [https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/access/239841751.html?dids=239841751:239841751&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Nov+16%2C+2002&amp;author=CAROL+BEGGY+%26+STEPHANIE+STOUGHTON&amp;pub=Boston+Globe&amp;desc=LETTING+FLY+SOME+JOKES%3B+CHAMPIONING+CHILDREN%3B+HERE%27S+TO+TENNIS%27S+BUD&amp;pqatl=google Letting fly some jokes; championing children; here's to tennis's bud.] ''[[Boston Globe]]''&lt;/ref&gt; A resident of [[Scottsdale, Arizona]], his career began when, at the urging of his sister, he performed at a [[comedy club]]'s open-mic night. A club owner in Los Angeles offered to make him a regular, but when Schimmel moved there he found that the club had burned down.&lt;ref name="blowen1998"&gt;Blowen, Michael (October 23, 1998). "Schimmel gets jokes the hard way." ''[[Boston Globe]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Undaunted, and with some help from [[Rodney Dangerfield]], who invited him to perform on his ''HBO Young Comedians Special'', Schimmel began making a name for himself.&lt;ref name="vaughan1999"&gt;Vaughan, Robin (November 5, 1999). Comedy; "Schimmel's a regular, stand-up guy." ''[[Boston Herald]]''&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote material for ''[[In Living Color]]'' and for comedians such as [[Yakov Smirnoff]] and [[Jimmie Walker]].&lt;ref name="brownfield1998a"&gt;Brownfield, Paul (October 13, 1998). Risque Business; "Comic Robert Schimmel, in Brea This Week, Is Happy Being Blue." ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Schimmel married his first wife, Vicki, in 1977, and they had four children together. Their son Derek died from cancer at the age of 11.&lt;ref name="beasley2010"&gt;Deena Beasley (September 5, 2010). [http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory?id=11564787 "U.S. Comedian Robert Schimmel Dies After Car Accident"] ''[[ABC News/Entertainment]]'', [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100908051622/http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory?id=11564787 |date=September 8, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Schimmel later divorced and remarried, having two sons with his second wife, Melissa.

==Comedic style==
Schimmel cited [[Lenny Bruce]] as his all-time comedy hero.&lt;ref name="rusnak1998"&gt;Rusnak, Jeff (August 27, 1998). Blue comic doesn't need Clinton gags. ''[[South Florida Sun-Sentinel]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Schimmel incorporated many aspects of his personal life into his act, even his cancer and the death of his son. In one signature bit, Schimmel joked about making obscene suggestions to a lady from the [[Make-a-Wish Foundation]].&lt;ref name="brownfield1998b"&gt;Brownfield, Paul (October 28, 1998). A Comedian's Life (Expletives Deleted); Comedy: There's a reason why Robert Schimmel doesn't have a sitcom. ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; His act was described as raunchy and sexually explicit, which he claimed as the reason he never appeared on network television.&lt;ref name="parks2001"&gt;Parks, Steve (January 26, 2001). Bald Humor / Robert Schimmel, a stand-up guy, fights cancer with chemo and comedy. ''[[New York Newsday]]''&lt;/ref&gt; He said his inappropriate comments on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'' and ''[[The Hollywood Squares]]'' caused him to be removed, though he later returned to O'Brien's show.&lt;ref name="board2009"&gt;Board, Josh (January 17, 2009). [http://www.sandiegoreader.com/weblogs/daily-crasher/2009/jan/17/angel-at-the-fence----the-comedy-of-robert-schimme/ Angel at the Fence – The Comedy of Robert Schimmel.] ''[[San Diego Reader]]''&lt;/ref&gt; However, his edgy style made him a hit on ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]''.

==Personal life==
As an adult, Schimmel suffered from cancer and had one of his testicles removed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jewishjournal.com/theater/article/robert_schimmel_cancer_through_a_lens_comedic_20080924/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, Schimmel suffered a heart attack. In June 2000, he was diagnosed with [[non-Hodgkin's lymphoma]]. His treatments included [[chemotherapy]] and required long stays in the hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/05/arts/television/05schimmel.html | work=The New York Times | title=Robert Schimmel, Provocative Comedian, Dies at 60 | first=Eric | last=Wilson | date=September 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schimmel was arrested in [[Calabasas, California]] on May 2, 2009 as a result of an alleged confrontation between himself and his wife Melissa. The district attorney eventually declined to press charges, citing insufficient evidence.&lt;ref name="moore2009"&gt;Moore, Tina (May 2, 2009).

[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/entertainment/2009164076_apuspeopleschimmel.html "Comedian Schimmel won't face assault charges in L.A."] ''[[Seattle Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

During an interview on ''The Howard Stern Show'' on January 28, 2010, Schimmel announced that he developed [[cirrhosis]] as a result of a [[hepatitis C]] infection from a [[blood transfusion]] that he received while in the Air Force. His cirrhosis had progressed to the point that he was working to be added to the waiting list for a donated liver.&lt;ref name="nytobit" /&gt;

==Death==
On August 26, 2010 in Scottsdale, Arizona. Schimmel was a passenger in a car driven by his 19-year-old daughter Aliyah. After veering off the road to avoid hitting another vehicle, the car flipped onto its side and came to a stop in the shoulder of the [[Arizona State Route 101|Loop 101]] freeway.&lt;ref name="young2010"&gt;Young, John (August 28, 2010).
