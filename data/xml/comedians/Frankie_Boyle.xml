== Career ==

=== Television ===

==== ''Mock the Week'' (2005–2009) ====
{{Main|Mock the Week}}
Boyle was a regular on the BBC panel show ''[[Mock the Week]]'' from its first episode on 5 June 2005 until 17 September 2009. A show in which the panel comment humorously on various news stories from the [[Media of the United Kingdom|British media]], ''Mock the Week'' is hosted by [[Dara Ó Briain]], who in an episode of ''Live at the Apollo'' referred to Boyle as "the dark heart of ''Mock the Week''."&lt;ref name="boyletimesonline"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/stage/comedy/article5037516.ece |title=Is Frankie Boyle the UK's most shocking comic? |publisher=Times Online |date=1 November 2008 |accessdate=28 May 2015 | location=London | first=Stephen | last=Dalton | deadurl=yes | archivedate=15 June 2011 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110615134953/http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/stage/comedy/article5037516.ece}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is known for his [[black comedy|morbid sense of humour]], which plays on negative images of celebrities, politicians, and society (particularly his home country of Scotland). On 2 October 2009, Boyle announced via the ''Mock the Week''{{'}}s Facebook fan page that he was leaving the show to concentrate on other projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/north_east/8287297.stm |title=Boyle leaves Mock The Week panel, BBC, 2 October 2009 |publisher=BBC News |date=2 October 2009 |accessdate=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boyle has since criticised both the show's production team and the [[BBC Trust]]. He claims that the show did not cover enough major news stories, and was too restrictive on his risqué comedy act because the producers and the BBC Trust were afraid of "frightening the horses".&lt;ref name="MSN"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Frankie Boyle slams Mock The Week |url=http://tv.uk.msn.com/news/articles.aspx?cp-documentid=150480748&amp;GT1=61503 |work=uk.msn |date=27 October 2009 |accessdate=1 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is seen in archive footage of ''Mock the Week'' on the 2009 Christmas Special, which aired on 22 December 2009, as a series of "Best Bits and Festive Clips", in a compilation celebrating the show's 100th episode on 5 July 2012 as well as in archive footage on the 2012 Christmas Special, which aired on 27 December 2012.

==== ''Frankie Boyle's Tramadol Nights'' (2010) ====
{{Main|Frankie Boyle's Tramadol Nights}}
In October 2009, Boyle piloted a sketch and stand-up show for [[Channel 4]], entitled ''Deal with This, Retards'' to be produced by RDF Scotland subsidiary the [[Comedy Unit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Parker |first=Robin |url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/news/broadcasters/bbc/boyle-quits-mock-the-week/5006386.article |title=Broadcast Now, 2 October 2009 |publisher=Broadcastnow.co.uk |date=2 October 2009 |accessdate=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boyle mentioned on ''[[Friday Night with Jonathan Ross]]'' that the original title of the show had been dropped, due to its offensive nature, and been renamed ''[[Frankie Boyle's Tramadol Nights|Tramadol Nights]]'' and aired from the end of November 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/showbiz/news/a259760/frankie-boyle-dismisses-comedy-controversy.html|title=Frankie Boyle dismisses comedy controversy|author=Mayer Nissim|publisher=Digital Spy|accessdate=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; An official page launched via Channel 4's official website, which confirmed that the show's full name is ''Frankie Boyle's Tramadol Nights'' and the series was made up of six episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/programmes/frankie-boyles-tramadol-nights |title=Frankie Boyle's Tramadol Nights |publisher=Channel 4 |date=29 December 2010 |accessdate=16 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boyle caused controversy on the show with his comments about [[Katie Price]] and [[Dwight Yorke]]'s disabled son Harvey.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0028/46729/obb179.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''Frankie Boyle's Rehabilitation Programme'' pilot (2011) ====

On 21 August 2011, it was revealed that Channel 4 had given Boyle permission to record a pilot for a topical talk show in October of that year, which would be called ''Frankie Boyle's Rehabilitation Programme'' (despite the controversy surrounding ''Frankie Boyle's Tramadol Nights''). Channel 4 head of comedy Shane Allen told the press that "it's very much like ''[[Parkinson (TV series)|Parkinson]]'' or ''[[Wogan]]'', but with paedo jokes" and that the show would feature Frankie "in a studio, riffing off the audience a bit with some people challenging what he says".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/aug/21/frankie-boyle-pilot-channel-4 |title=Channel 4 line up return for Frankie Boyle |publisher=The Guardian |date=21 August 2011 |accessdate=17 June 2012 |location=London |first=Patrick |last=Foster}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''The Boyle Variety Performance'' (2012) ====
''The Boyle Variety Performance'' was broadcast on 19 August 2012 and featured Boyle with guests [[Rob Delaney (comedian)|Rob Delaney]], [[Nick Helm]], [[Katherine Ryan]] and [[Tom Stade]]. A few days after the show was broadcast, Boyle attracted criticism after he posted jokes on Twitter about the [[2012 Summer Paralympics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/aug/31/frankie-boyle-paralympics-twitter-jokes?newsfeed=true |title=Frankie Boyle Paralympics Twitter jokes prove last straw for Channel 4 |publisher=The Guardian |date=30 August 2012 |accessdate=1 September 2012 |location=London |first=Josh |last=Halliday}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''Gasping'' (2014) ====
In 2014, Frankie Boyle starred in the short comedy film ''Gasping'' for BBC Scotland, written by [[Greg Hemphill]]. The title refers to an expression in [[Scottish English]], communicative of an irresistible compulsion to do something, such as smoke a cigarette; or, as here, to drink alcohol. The short feature, an at-times-farcical but generally deadpan treatment of a man's attempted recovery from alcoholism.

==== ''Frankie Boyle's Autopsy Series'' (2014–2016) ====
''Frankie Boyle's Referendum Autopsy'' was released on 28 September 2014, and ''Frankie Boyle's Election Autopsy'' was released on 17 May 2015, through [[BBC iPlayer]]. Featuring guests Katherine Ryan and [[Sara Pascoe]], Boyle dissected the [[Scottish independence referendum]], 2014 and [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|general election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/may/20/frankie-boyle-bbc-election-autopsy-comedy-iplayer|title=Frankie Boyle’s Election Autopsy is too hot for TV – so much the better|last=Logan|first=Brian|date=20 May 2015|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|accessdate=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Frankie Boyle's American Autopsy'' dissected the buildup and fallout of the United States presidential election, tackling topics such as feminism, entertainment, propaganda, and guns. Special guests include Sara Pascoe, Katherine Ryan, [[Michelle Wolf]], Desiree Burch, and [[Richard Osman]].

==== ''Frankie Boyle's New World Order'' (2017) ====
A show similar to his BBC iPlayer exclusive "autopsy" shows, Boyle returned to TV on [[BBC Two]], with this ''[[Frankie Boyle's New World Order]]'', which follows a very similar structure to the aforementioned programmes, where Frankie makes two statements, and discusses them with his guests. The difference is that the studio audience do not vote on if they agree with that statement. The show premiered on 8 June 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2017-05-25/bbc2-to-broadcast-new-frankie-boyle-satirical-show-right-after-general-election-polls-close|title=Frankie Boyle' new BBC political comedy to air right after UK Election 2017 polls close|last=Dowell|first=Ben|date=25 May 2017|work=[[Radio Times]]|accessdate=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A sitcom set in a small regional theatre starring [[David Mitchell (comedian)|David Mitchell]] as a happy-go-lucky writer with writer's block written by Frankie Boyle and Steven Dick, broadcast on [[BBC Radio 4]] on 5 June 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/radio/blocked/ | title=Blocked |publisher=British Comedy Guide |accessdate=11 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Live shows ===
In October 2007 Boyle embarked on a stand-up tour of Britain, playing over 100 dates and enjoying a sold-out run that was extended through until December 2008. Boyle said that he planned to quit stand-up before he turned 40, had written his final tour and plans to do more television work after this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2009/07/02/9213/boyle%3A_im_quitting_stand-up |title=Boyle: I'm Quitting Stand up |publisher=Chortle.co.uk |date= |accessdate=26 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boyle performed the tour, entitled ''I Would Happily Punch Every One of You in the Face'' between March and December 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ticketmaster.co.uk/Frankie-Boyle-Live-tickets/artist/953249?CAMEFROM=CFC_UK_EV0542_WEBLINK |title=Frankie Boyle Live Tickets |publisher=Ticketmaster |date= |accessdate=7 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Deleted image removed:  [[File:FrankieBoyleLiveDVD.jpg|thumb|upright|Cover of his live DVD]] --&gt;

On 21 November 2011, at a "Meet the Comedians" session in the [[Apple Store]], [[Regent Street]] with [[Jimmy Carr]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/meet-comedians-jimmy-carr/id484003108 |title=iTunes – Podcasts – Meet the Comedians: Jimmy Carr and Frankie Boyle by Events at the Apple Store |publisher=Itunes.apple.com |date=28 November 2011 |accessdate=16 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boyle announced he was doing another tour entitled ''The Last Days of Sodom'', despite intending ''I Would Happily Punch Every One of You in the Face'' to be his final one. He mentioned the tour will not be as long as its predecessor. His website has stated it will run from July to December 2012 with more dates to be added.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frankieboyle.com/tourdates.html |title=Frankie Boyle |publisher=Frankie Boyle |date= |accessdate=16 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tickets went on sale in December 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ticketmaster.co.uk/Frankie-Boyle-Live-tickets/artist/33779 |title=Frankie Boyle Live Tickets 2012|publisher=Ticketmaster |date= |accessdate=9 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== DVD releases ===
On 10 November 2008, Boyle's first DVD was released,&lt;ref name="boyletimesonline" /&gt; featuring a sell-out stand-up performance given at London's [[Hackney Empire]] and some additional material, including a documentary about the tour, entitled ''Fuck You Scotland'', and some sketches from the [[BBC Three]] comedy ''[[Rush Hour (UK TV series)|Rush Hour]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media notes |title=Frankie Boyle Live DVD |titlelink= |year= |others=Brian Klein |publisher=[[Channel 4]] |location= |id= |language= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The DVD was described by WhatDVD.net as "certainly not one to watch with your grandparents – not unless they are pretty open-minded!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lianne |url=http://www.whatdvd.net/frankie-boyle-live-dvd-review-122.html |title=Frankie Boyle Live DVD Review |publisher=WhatDVD.net |date=13 November 2008 |accessdate=7 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boyle has also featured in three DVD compilations of material from ''[[Mock the Week]]''. The compilations, entitled ''Too Hot for TV'', include material deemed too offensive for broadcast on TV and uncut versions of several full episodes. Boyle's second live DVD, ''If I Could Reach Out Through Your TV and Strangle You I Would'', was released on 15 November 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.play.com/DVD/DVD/4-/12041662/Frankie-Boyle-Live-2-I-Would-Happily-Punch-Every-One-Of-You-In-The-Face/Product.html |title=''Play.com'' – Frankie Boyle Live 2 |publisher=Play.com |date= |accessdate=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Podcast ===
On 16 July 2009, Boyle's first podcast was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&amp;friendId=114749422&amp;blogId=500565493 |title=Frankie's Podcast |publisher=MySpace |date=16 July 2009 |accessdate=30 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archivedate=6 November 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106081646/http://www.myspace.com/frankieboylelive/blog/500565493}}&lt;/ref&gt; Entitled ''Mock the Week Musings'', the podcast is a recording of Boyle testing the material he has written for ''Mock the Week'' to a London audience. Boyle comments on his material throughout and often informs the audience that certain jokes are not going into the show due to their reaction (or lack thereof), and the podcast carries an explicit content warning. The recording includes some audience interaction, with Boyle offering to test some of his new "put-downs" on the crowd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast | url=https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=323684930 | title=Mock The Week Musings | website=[[iTunes]] | publisher=BBC | host=Frankie Boyle | date=16 July 2009 | accessdate =24 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2013 and 2015, Boyle, along with Canadian comedian [[Glenn Wool]] hosted a number of editions of a podcast known as Freestyle, which involved Boyle and Wool speaking about topical and controversial news stories, including [[Madeleine McCann]], [[Bill Cosby]], and obscure takes on popular culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast | title=Freestyle |url=http://frankieboyle.podbean.com/ |}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Comic book ===
In September 2010, Boyle began publishing his comic strip ''Rex Royd'' in the launch issue of ''[[CLiNT]]'' magazine, co-written with comedian Jim Muir and with artwork by Michael Dowling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=37302 |title=CLINT WEEK: COMEDIAN FRANKIE BOYLE ROCKS "REX ROYD" |publisher=CBR |date=2 March 2012 |accessdate=12 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story follows a [[Lex Luthor]]-style newspaper magnate with a super-villain alter-ego. Initially, the strip ran for first four issues of ''CLiNT''. The strip resumed again in November 2011, until the final issue in August 2013, when publisher [[Titan Magazines|Titan]] announced that ''CLiNT'' was ending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=47315 |title=Comicbookresources.com |publisher=Comicbookresources.com |date=14 August 2013 |accessdate=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other appearances ===
Boyle appeared as himself in the video game ''[[Grand Theft Auto: The Lost and Damned]]'' (2009), in a stand-up routine at Liberty City's Split Sides Comedy Club. He appeared on Real Radio Wales's weekly comedy show ''Comedy Nighthorse'' on 19 October 2011. Boyle writes satire and opinion pieces for the British newspaper [[The Guardian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/profile/frankie-boyle|title=Frankie Boyle|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
Boyle has regularly been involved in public controversies due to the acerbic nature of his humour.

=== Rebecca Adlington ===
Boyle managed to attract criticism in August 2008 when complaints were received about comments he made regarding British Olympic swimmer [[Rebecca Adlington]] on ''Mock the Week'', saying that she "looks like someone who's looking at themselves in the back of a [[spoon]]". The BBC ruled that the jokes were indeed "humiliating" and "risked offending the audience", while also calling Boyle "a brilliant member of the team".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8314495.stm |title='Mock' rapped over swimmer jibes |publisher=BBC |date=19 October 2009 |accessdate=14 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, Adlington's agent said that simply admitting mistakes was not enough, saying: "By giving Frankie Boyle a rebuke they fail to discourage others from doing the same."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8337421.stm |title=Swimmer queries Mock show ruling |publisher=BBC |date=2 November 2009 |accessdate=14 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adlington later went on to comment on this issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/8575567/Rebecca-Adlington-Im-over-the-Frankie-Boyle-spoon-jibe.html |title=Rebecca Adlington: I'm over the Frankie Boyle spoon jibe |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=14 June 2011 |accessdate=20 October 2011 |location=London |first=Anita |last=Singh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Queen ===
In October 2008, during [[The Russell Brand Show prank telephone calls row|''The Russell Brand Show'' prank telephone calls row]], Boyle found himself in the midst of a scandal when the BBC broadcast a ''Mock the Week'' repeat in which he made a joke about [[Elizabeth II|the Queen]]. Whilst pretending to be the Queen in the "Scenes We'd Like To See" segment of ''Mock The Week'', Boyle said "I am now so old, my pussy is haunted". This caused many to complain about the state that the BBC had come to, with [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MP [[David Davies (Welsh politician)|David Davies]] calling the joke a "disgracefully foul comment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rashid Razaq |url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23580712-corporation-attacked-for-offensive-joke-about-the-queen.do |title=Corporation attacked for offensive joke about the Queen |publisher=ThisIsLondon.co.uk |date=31 October 2008 |accessdate=14 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boyle was eventually cleared of any misconduct by the BBC Trust, although they called the comment "sexist and ageist".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Tara Conlan |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/oct/19/frankie-boyle-mock-the-week |title=Frankie Boyle's 'sexist' joke about Queen cleared by BBC Trust |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=19 October 2009 |accessdate=14 December 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Down's syndrome ===
In a performance on his 2010 tour, Boyle interrupted a "long, seemingly semi-improvised skit" about [[Down syndrome]] by challenging a woman in the front row who seemed uncomfortable with the material.&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt; The audience member explained that her five-year-old daughter had the condition and strongly criticised Boyle's portrayal of people with Down syndrome.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{Cite news  | last = Walker | first = Peter | title = Frankie Boyle meets his match in mother of a child with Down syndrome | newspaper = The Guardian | publisher = Guardian News and Media Limited | date = 8 April 2010  | url = https://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/apr/08/frankie-boyle-downs-syndrome  | accessdate =12 April 2010 | location=London | postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

=== Palestine and Israel ===
In April 2010, the [[BBC Trust]]'s Editorial Standards Committee apologised for a joke made by Boyle on [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]] panel show ''[[Political Animal (radio show)|Political Animal]]'' in which he likened the situation in [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] to "a cake being punched to pieces by a very angry [[Jewish|Jew]]". Boyle also made another joke where he said that he had "been studying Israeli Army martial arts. I now know 16 ways to kick a Palestinian woman in the back".&lt;ref name="palestinerow"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8650254.stm |title=BBC apologises for Frankie Boyle joke |publisher=BBC |date=28 April 2010 |accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Boyle published a letter in which he criticised the Trust's "cowardly rebuke of my jokes about Palestine" and reprinted the jokes in question. He then criticised the BBC for not broadcasting a humanitarian appeal during the 2008–2009 [[Gaza War (2008–09)|Gaza War]], saying that it was "tragic for such a great institution but it is now cravenly afraid of giving offence and vulnerable to any kind of well drilled lobbying." Boyle then said that the situation in Palestine "seems to be, in essence, apartheid", concluding that he had reached this position after watching a documentary about life in Palestine that he said had driven him to tears.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news  | last = Boyle | first = Frankie | author-link =   | title = Frankie Boyle letter about BBC in full  | newspaper = The Telegraph  | date = 1 May 2010  | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/7660232/Frankie-Boyle-letter-about-BBC-in-full.html  | accessdate =1 May 2010 | location=London  | postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, Boyle accused BBC television producers of "editing out" comments he made on ''New World Order'' about [[2018 Gaza border protests| Palestinian deaths on the Gaza border]] and his joke about "Israel being an Apartheid state”.&lt;ref name="newworldediting"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/frankie-boyle-new-world-order-antisemitism-bbc-1.464439 |title=Frankie Boyle claims 'Apartheid' Israel jokes were cut from BBC show |publisher=The Jewish Chronichle|date=22 May 2018 |accessdate=28 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Harvey Price ===
In December 2010, both [[Katie Price]] (a.k.a. Jordan) and [[Peter Andre]] were said to have been left "absolutely disgusted and sickened" by a joke that was made on ''[[Frankie Boyle's Tramadol Nights]]'' about Price's heavily disabled son, Harvey. On the show, Boyle said: "Apparently Jordan and Peter Andre are fighting each other over custody of Harvey. Well eventually one of them will lose ... and have to keep him." Then he added: "I have a theory that Jordan married a cage fighter ([[Alex Reid (fighter)|Alex Reid]]) because she needed someone strong enough to stop Harvey from fucking her."&lt;ref name="pricejoke"&gt;{{Cite news|author=Christian Tobin |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/showbiz/news/a292233/price-andre-sickened-by-frankie-boyle-joke.html |title=Price, Andre "sickened" by Frankie Boyle joke |publisher=[[DigitalSpy]] |date=9 December 2010 |accessdate=3 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andre's representative also responded to the comments made by Boyle and said "We're all disgusted by these comments. Peter is angry and very upset at Harvey being mocked in this way. Children, especially a disabled youngster, should be off-limits." Both confirmed that they had sought legal action and wrote a complaint to Channel 4 regarding Boyle's jokes with Price saying: "To bully this unbelievably brave child is despicable; to broadcast it is to show a complete and utter lack of judgement. I have asked my lawyers to write to Channel 4."&lt;ref name="pricejoke" /&gt; [[Ofcom]] confirmed that Price issued a complaint and accordingly launched an investigation into the programme.&lt;ref name="tramadolinvestigated"&gt;{{Cite news|author=John Plunkett |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/dec/10/frankie-boyle-katie-price |title=Frankie Boyle's Katie Price joke sparks Ofcom investigation |publisher=The Guardian |date=10 December 2010 |accessdate=3 January 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2011, Ofcom ruled Channel 4 had breached broadcasting rules by transmitting the material in question but did not require the network to broadcast an apology saying that it was an "erroneous decision on a matter of editorial judgment on the broadcaster's part". Price criticised the decision not to require a broadcast apology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/showbiz/article-23938327-ofcom-slams-frankie-boyle-jokes-about-katie-prices-disabled-son-harvey.do |title=Ofcom slams Frankie Boyle 'jokes' about Katie Price's disabled son Harvey |publisher=Thisislondon.co.uk |date=4 April 2011 |accessdate=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boyle discussed the material onstage at a charity gig some months later, saying that the joke was intended to highlight how Price exploited her son, and that he felt the two aspects of Price's media profile, "her disabled son and her sexuality", did not belong together. He rejected comments that the joke may have led to playground bullying, saying that "I find it hard to believe there are kids at that school who would like to slag Harvey, but can't think of an angle."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2011/03/22/13005/frankie_boyle_stands_firm_over_harvey_gag |title=Chortle.co.uk |publisher=Chortle.co.uk |date=22 March 2011 |accessdate=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Allegations of racism and  consequent libel action ===
In July 2011, the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' published an article strongly criticizing Boyle which alleged he had been forced to quit ''Mock the Week'' and described him as a "racist comedian". Boyle, in response, sued the ''Mirror'' for libel. In October 2012, a jury found in his favour, ordering the ''Mirror'' to pay him £54,650 in damages, all of which he donated to charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Halliday|first=Josh|title=Frankie Boyle wins more than £50,000 libel damages from Daily Mirror|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/22/frankie-boyle-libel-damages-daily-mirror|accessdate=23 October 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=22 October 2012|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Give It Up for Comic Relief'' ===
On 6 March 2013, Boyle caused controversy when he was invited to perform at [[Russell Brand]]'s [[BBC Three]] fundraiser ''Give It Up for Comic Relief'' at [[Wembley Arena]]. He made a series of jokes about Comic Relief itself, [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]], [[Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge]], [[Oscar Pistorius]], [[Pope Benedict XVI]] and the [[Jimmy Savile sexual abuse scandal]].&lt;ref name="Independent"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/i-wish-the-queen-had-died-offensive-frankie-boyle-jokes-cut-from-bbc-comic-relief-broadcast-8524030.html|title='I wish the Queen had died': Offensive Frankie Boyle jokes cut from BBC Comic Relief broadcast|work=[[The Independent]]|date=7 March 2013|accessdate=8 April 2013|location=London|first=Daisy|last=Wyatt}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was deemed so distasteful that his entire six-minute performance was cut out of the broadcast version of the 3.5-hour show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/03/07/frankie-boyle-russell-brand-give-it-up-for-comic-relief-_n_2826899.html | title=Frankie Boyle Axed From Russell Brand's 'Give It Up For Comic Relief' Show On BBC Three Over 'Disgusting' Jokes | work=[[The Huffington Post]] | date=7 March 2013 | accessdate=9 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013, Boyle supported [[Shaker Aamer]], the last UK resident being held at [[Guantanamo Bay]], by going on a [[hunger strike]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-23389757|title=Frankie Boyle hunger strike in support of Shaker Aamer|work=BBC News|date=20 July 2013|accessdate=20 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boyle is a supporter of the Glasgow-based [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] Football Club.

Boyle's comedy influences include [[Billy Connolly|Sir Billy Connolly]], [[Bill Hicks]] and [[Spike Milligan]]. The fellow Scottish shock comedian [[Jerry Sadowitz]] is often cited as an influence on Boyle, although Boyle himself has discounted this.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

Boyle is a supporter of [[Scottish independence]]. When asked "How do you feel about independence?" Frankie replied with "Yes, I think we should be independent. What have we got to lose? A Tory government? I'm looking forward to the vote just because it will be a novelty for Scottish people to fill in official forms while still in possession of their own belt and shoelaces. And imagine what Scotland's annual Independence Day celebrations will look like; the fucking D-Day Landings."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theskinny.co.uk/comedy/features/306416-what_offends_frankie_boyle|title=What Offends Frankie Boyle?|work=The Skinny|date=4 December 2013|accessdate=22 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
