'''Goldie Jeanne Hawn''' (born November 21, 1945) is an American actress, producer, and occasional singer.&lt;ref name="biography.com"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.biography.com/people/goldie-hawn-9331873 | title=Goldie Hawn Biography: Actress (1945–) | publisher= [[Biography.com]] ([[FYI (TV channel)|FYI]] / [[A&amp;E Networks]]) | accessdate= February 8, 2016| archivedate = December 24, 2015| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20151224115853/http://www.biography.com/people/goldie-hawn-9331873 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Biography.com citation also verifies full name Goldie Jeanne Hawn--&gt; She rose to fame on the [[NBC]] sketch comedy program ''[[Rowan &amp; Martin's Laugh-In]]'' (1968–70) before going on to receive the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] and the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Motion Picture|Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for her performance in ''[[Cactus Flower (film)|Cactus Flower]]'' (1969).

Hawn maintained [[bankable star]] status for more than three decades while appearing in films such as ''[[There's a Girl in My Soup]]'' (1970), ''[[Butterflies Are Free]]'' (1972), ''[[The Sugarland Express]]'' (1974), ''[[Shampoo (film)|Shampoo]]'' (1975), ''[[Foul Play (1978 film)|Foul Play]]'' (1978), ''[[Seems Like Old Times (film)|Seems Like Old Times]]'' (1980), and ''[[Private Benjamin (1980 film)|Private Benjamin]]'' (1980), for which she was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] for playing the title role.

Hawn's later work includes starring roles in the films ''[[Overboard (1987 film)|Overboard]]'' (1987), ''[[Bird on a Wire (film)|Bird on a Wire]]'' (1990), ''[[Death Becomes Her]]'' (1992), ''[[Housesitter]]'' (1992), ''[[The First Wives Club]]'' (1996), ''The Out of Towners'' (1999) and ''[[The Banger Sisters]]'' (2002). After a fifteen-year hiatus from film acting, Hawn made her comeback in ''[[Snatched (2017 film)|Snatched]]'' (2017). She is the mother of actors [[Oliver Hudson]], [[Kate Hudson]], and [[Wyatt Russell]], and has been in a relationship with actor [[Kurt Russell]] since 1983. In 2003, she founded The Hawn Foundation, which helps underprivileged children.

==Early life==
Hawn was born in [[Washington, D.C.]],&lt;ref name="biography.com"/&gt; the daughter of Laura (née Steinhoff; November 27, 1913 – November 27, 1993), a jewelry shop/dance school owner, and Edward Rutledge Hawn&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/10/obituaries/edward-rutledge-hawn-73-leader-of-godfrey-orchestra.html|title=Edward Rutledge Hawn, 73, Leader of Godfrey Orchestra|publisher=NYTimes.com|date=1982-06-10|accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=filmref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/94/Goldie-Hawn.html|title=Goldie Hawn Biography|publisher=FilmReference.com|accessdate=February 8, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018193930/http://www.filmreference.com/film/94/Goldie-Hawn.html|archivedate= October 18, 2015|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; (September 28, 1908 – June 7, 1982), a band musician who played at major events in Washington. She was named after her mother's aunt.&lt;ref name=actors&gt;Stated in Hawn interview on ''[[Inside the Actors Studio]]'', 2008&lt;/ref&gt; She has one sister, entertainment publicist Patti Hawn (born March 24, 1938); their brother, Edward Jr. (born February 10, 1937) died as an infant shortly before Patti was conceived.

Her father was a [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] of [[Germany|German]] and [[English people|English]] descent. Her mother was [[Jews|Jewish]], the daughter of emigrants from [[History of the Jews in Hungary|Hungary]].&lt;ref name="BBCinterview"&gt;{{cite video|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01cvpz1|first=Goldie|last=Hawn|title=Woman's Hour|publisher=[[BBC Radio]]|date=March 6, 2012|accessdate=March 6, 2012|time=10:17|quote=I'm Jewish....I've studied Buddhism.

Hawn began taking ballet and tap dance lessons at the age of three and danced in the corps de ballet of the [[Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo]] production of ''[[The Nutcracker]]'' in 1955. She made her stage debut in 1964, playing Juliet in a Virginia Shakespeare Festival production of ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"'Romeo and Juliet' Performance a Hit," ''Daily Press'' (Newport News, Virginia), August 18, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1964, she ran and taught in a ballet school, having dropped out of [[American University]] where she was majoring in drama. In 1964, Hawn made her professional dancing debut in a production of ''[[Can-Can (musical)|Can-Can]]'' at the Texas Pavilion of the [[1964 New York World's Fair|New York World's Fair]]. She began working as a professional dancer a year later and appeared as a [[go-go dancer]] in New York City&lt;ref name="actors"/&gt; and at the Peppermint Box in New Jersey.&lt;ref name= interviewmag2017/&gt;

==Career==
===1960s===
[[File:Goldie Hawn - 1970.jpg|thumb|Publicity photo for ''[[Cactus Flower (film)|Cactus Flower]]'' (1969)]]
Hawn moved to California to dance in a show at a theater across from Disneyland.&lt;ref name=interviewmag2017/&gt; Hawn began her acting career as a cast member of the short-lived [[CBS]] situation comedy ''[[Good Morning, World]]'' during the 1967–68 television season, her role being that of the girlfriend of a radio disc jockey, with a stereotypical "[[dumb blonde]]" personality.&lt;ref name=actors/&gt;

Her next role, which brought her to international attention, was as one of the regular cast members on the 1968–1973 [[sketch comedy]] show, ''[[Rowan &amp; Martin's Laugh-In]]''. On the show, she would often break out into high-pitched giggles in the middle of a joke, and deliver a polished performance a moment after. Noted equally for her chipper attitude as for her [[bikini]] and painted body, Hawn was seen as something of a 1960s [[It girl|"It" girl]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | last=Heyman | first=Marshall | date=May 17, 2017 | title=Solid Goldie: Goldie Hawn Is Back and Better Than Ever | work=[[Harper's Bazaar]] | url=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/features/a9661481/goldie-hawn-interview/ | access-date=March 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her ''Laugh-In'' persona was parlayed into three popular film appearances in the late 1960s and early 1970s: ''[[Cactus Flower (film)|Cactus Flower]]'', ''[[There's a Girl in My Soup]]'', and ''[[Butterflies Are Free]]''. Hawn had made her feature film debut in a bit role as a giggling dancer in the 1968 film ''[[The One and Only, Genuine, Original Family Band]]'', in which she was billed as "Goldie Jeanne", but in her first major film role, in ''Cactus Flower'' (1969), she won an [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] as [[Walter Matthau]]'s suicidal fiancée.

===1970s===
[[File:Goldie Hawn Carl Reiner Laugh In 1970.JPG|thumb|left|uprignt|With [[Carl Reiner]] on ''Rowan &amp; Martin's Laugh-In'', 1970]]
After Hawn's Academy Award win, her film career took off. She starred in a string of above average and successful comedies starting with ''[[There's a Girl in My Soup]]'' (1970), ''[[$ (film)|$]]'' (1971), and ''[[Butterflies Are Free]]'' (1972). She continued proving herself in the dramatic league with the 1974 satirical dramas ''[[The Girl from Petrovka]]'' and ''[[The Sugarland Express]]'', and ''[[Shampoo (film)|Shampoo]]'' in 1975. She also hosted two television specials: ''Pure Goldie'' in 1971 and ''The Goldie Hawn Special'' in 1978. The latter was a sort of comeback for Hawn, who had been out of the spotlight for two years since the 1976 release of ''[[The Duchess and the Dirtwater Fox]]'', while she was focusing on her marriage and the birth of her son.

On the special she performed show tunes and comedy bits alongside comic legend [[George Burns]], teen matinee idol [[Shaun Cassidy]], television star [[John Ritter]] (during his days on ''[[Three's Company]]''), and even the [[Harlem Globetrotters]] joined her for a montage. The special later went on to be nominated for a primetime Emmy. Four months later the film ''[[Foul Play (1978 film)|Foul Play]]'' (with [[Chevy Chase]]), was released and became a box office smash, reviving Hawn's film career. The plot centered around an innocent woman in San Francisco who becomes mixed up in an assassination plot.

Hawn's next film, [[Mario Monicelli]]'s ''[[Lovers and Liars]]'' (1979), was a [[box office bomb]]. In 1972 Hawn recorded and released a solo country LP for [[Warner Brothers]], titled ''Goldie''. It was recorded with the help of [[Dolly Parton]] and [[Buck Owens]]. [[AllMusic]] gives the album a favorable review, calling it a "sweetly endearing country-tinged middle of the road pop record".&lt;ref name="amg_record_review"&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r574832/review|pure_url=yes}}|title=Goldie: Review|last=Mason|first=Stewart|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=November 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s===
Hawn's popularity continued into the 1980s, starting with another primetime variety special alongside actress and singer [[Liza Minnelli]], ''Goldie and Liza Together'' (1980), which was nominated for four [[Emmy Award]]s. In the same year, Hawn took the lead role in ''[[Private Benjamin (1980 film)|Private Benjamin]]'', a comedy she co-produced with her friend [[Nancy Meyers]], who co-wrote the script. Meyers recalls Hawn's reaction when she first described the idea for the story:
{{quote|It was like watching the greatest audience I've ever seen. She laughed and then she got real emotional and her eyes would fill up with tears. She loved the image of herself in an Army uniform and she loved what the movie had to say.&lt;ref&gt;Schneck, Dale. "Friendship with Goldie Hawn led to 'Private Benjamin'", ''The Morning Call'' (Allentown, PA), Nov. 5, 1980&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''Private Benjamin'', also stars [[Eileen Brennan]] and [[Armand Assante]], and garnered Hawn her second [[Academy Award]] nomination, this time for Best Actress.&lt;ref name=actors/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TPS7pbioI4|title=Private Benjamin - 1980 Trailer|first=|last=|date=August 2, 2016|publisher=|accessdate=July 28, 2017|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hawn's box office success continued with comedies like ''[[Seems Like Old Times (film)|Seems Like Old Times]]'' (1980), written by [[Neil Simon]], ''[[Protocol (film)|Protocol]]'' (1984), co-written by Nancy Meyers, and ''[[Wildcats (film)|Wildcats]]'' (1986)&amp;nbsp;— Hawn also served as executive producer on the latter two&amp;nbsp;— and dramas like ''[[Best Friends (1982 film)|Best Friends]]'' (1982) and ''[[Swing Shift (film)|Swing Shift]]'' (1984).

[[File:Goldie Hawn.jpg|thumb|upright|Hawn at the [[Grand Hôtel (Stockholm)|Grand Hôtel]] in Stockholm 1981]]

At the age of thirty-nine, Hawn posed for the cover of ''[[Playboy]]''{{'s}} January 1985 issue, in which she was the subject of the [[Playboy#The Playboy Interview|Playboy Interview]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/e1/9a/df/e19adf43dd7d22fdebfabec460d88d6f.jpg Hawn on the cover of Playboy magazine], January 1985&lt;/ref&gt; Her last film of the 1980s was opposite partner [[Kurt Russell]], for the third time, in the comedy ''[[Overboard (1987 film)|Overboard]]'' (1987).

===1990s===
In 1990 she starred in the action comedy ''[[Bird on a Wire (film)|Bird on a Wire]]'', a critically panned but commercially successful picture that paired Hawn with [[Mel Gibson]]. Hawn had mixed success in the early 1990s, with the thriller ''[[Deceived]]'' (1991), the drama ''[[CrissCross]]'' and opposite [[Bruce Willis]] and [[Meryl Streep]] in ''[[Death Becomes Her]]'' (both 1992). Earlier that year, she starred in ''[[Housesitter (film)|Housesitter]]'', a screwball comedy with [[Steve Martin]], which was a commercial success.

Hawn was absent from the screen for four years while caring for her mother who died of cancer in 1994.&lt;ref name=actors/&gt; Hawn made her entry back into film as producer of the satirical comedy ''[[Something to Talk About (film)|Something to Talk About]]'' starring [[Julia Roberts]] and [[Dennis Quaid]], as well as making her directorial debut in the television film ''Hope'' (1997) starring [[Christine Lahti]] and [[Jena Malone]].&lt;ref name=actors/&gt;
[[File:Goldie Hawn cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Hawn in 1989]]
Hawn returned to the screen again in 1996 as the aging, alcoholic actress Elise Elliot in the financially and critically successful ''[[The First Wives Club]]'', opposite [[Bette Midler]] and [[Diane Keaton]], with whom she covered the [[Lesley Gore]] hit "[[You Don't Own Me]]" for the film's soundtrack. Hawn also performed a [[cover version]] of the [[The Beatles|Beatles]]' song, "[[A Hard Day's Night (song)|A Hard Day's Night]]", on [[George Martin]]'s 1998 album, ''[[In My Life (George Martin album)|In My Life]]''.

She continued her tenure in the 1990s with Woody Allen's musical ''[[Everyone Says I Love You]]'' (1996) and reuniting with Steve Martin for the comedy ''[[The Out-of-Towners (1999 film)|The Out-of-Towners]]'' (1999), a remake of the [[The Out-of-Towners (1970 film)|1970 Neil Simon hit]]. The film was critically panned and was not successful at the box office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Out-Of-Towners (1999)|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1087047-outoftowners|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=July 29, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110424181435/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1087047-outoftowners|archivedate=April 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Out-of-Towners|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=out-of-towners.htm|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]|accessdate=July 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, Hawn, along with her co-stars from ''The First Wives Club'', [[Diane Keaton]] and [[Bette Midler]], were recipients of the [[Crystal Award|Women in Film Crystal Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wif.org/past-recipients|title=Past Recipients|publisher=wif.org|accessdate=May 9, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110630083646/http://wif.org/past-recipients|archivedate=June 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, she was awarded [[Hasty Pudding Woman of the Year]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/1999/02.18/pudding.html|work= [[Harvard Gazette]]|title= The Pudding &amp; the Pot|publisher=President and Fellows of Harvard College|date=February 18, 1999|accessdate=March 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000s===

In 2001 Hawn was reunited with former co-stars [[Warren Beatty]] (her co-star in ''[[$ (film)|$]]'' and ''[[Shampoo (film)|Shampoo]]'') and [[Diane Keaton]] for the comedy ''[[Town &amp; Country (film)|Town &amp; Country]]'', a critical and financial fiasco. Budgeted at an estimated US$90&amp;nbsp;million, the film opened to little notice and grossed only $7&amp;nbsp;million in its North American theatrical release.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/town_and_country/ Review of ''Town &amp; Country''], Rotten Tomatoes&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, she starred in ''[[The Banger Sisters]]'', opposite [[Susan Sarandon]] and [[Geoffrey Rush]], her last live action film for fifteen years. In 2005 Hawn's autobiography, ''[[A Lotus Grows in the Mud]]'', was published.

===2010s===
In 2013, Hawn guest-starred, along with [[Gordon Ramsay]], in an episode of ''[[Phineas and Ferb]]'', in which she provided the voice of neighbor Peggy McGee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exclusive: Hawn Gets Animated For 'Phineas &amp; Ferb'|date=September 12, 2013|publisher=''[[Entertainment Tonight]]''|url=http://www.etonline.com/tv/138353_Exclusive_Clip_Goldie_Hawn_Guests_as_Peggy_McGee_on_Phineas_and_Ferb/|accessdate=April 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Goldie Hawn to voice character on 'Phineas and Ferb'|date=September 12, 2013|publisher=United Press International|url=http://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/TV/2013/09/12/Goldie-Hawn-to-voice-character-on-Phineas-and-Ferb/35341379038452/|accessdate=April 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Hawn has studied meditation. In a 2012 interview, she stated, "I don't think of myself as a Buddhist. I was born Jewish, and I consider that my religion." She also stated, "It's not the idea of a particular religion that's important; it's the development of a spiritual life."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prevention.com/mind-body/emotional-health/goldie-hawn-happiness-and-meditation-tips?page=2 Goldie Hawn happiness and meditation tips], Prevention&lt;/ref&gt;

Hawn is a supporter of the [[LGBT community]].
