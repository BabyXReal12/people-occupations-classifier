'''Colin Andrew Mochrie''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɒ|k|r|i}}; born November 30, 1957) is a Scottish-born Canadian actor and [[Improvisational theatre|improvisational]] [[Comedy|comedian]], most famous for his appearances on the [[Whose Line Is It Anyway? (UK TV series)|British]] and [[Whose Line Is It Anyway? (U.S. TV series)|US]] versions of television improvisation show ''Whose Line Is It Anyway?''

==Early life==
Colin Mochrie was born in [[Kilmarnock]], [[Scotland]], the oldest of three children. His father was an airline maintenance executive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/13/Colin-Mochrie.html|title=Colin Mochrie Biography (1957-)|website=www.filmreference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was shy as a child, stating that neighbours would have commented that he "watched way too much television."&lt;ref name="santa"&gt;{{cite news|first=Bridget|last=Byrne|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WDwVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=bAgEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6694,4786788|title=Comedian keeps track of Santa|work=[[Ocala Star-Banner]]|date=December 24, 2000|page=7D}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964, his family moved to a French neighbourhood just outside [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], and five years later moved again to [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]].&lt;ref name="towncrier"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mytowncrier.ca/arts/funnyman-mochrie-shy-guy-at-heart/|first=Lorianna|last=De Giorgio|title=Funnyman Mochrie shy guy at heart|work=Town Crier Online|publisher=Multimedia Nova Corporation|date=February 23, 2006|accessdate=March 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mochrie attended [[Killarney Secondary School]], where he was a self-proclaimed loner who wanted to become a [[marine biologist]].&lt;ref name="mockery"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2005/nov/25/colin-doesnt-make-mockery-of-lv-comedy/|title=Colin doesn't make mockery of LV comedy|first=Jerry|last=Fink|work=[[Las Vegas Sun]]|date=November 25, 2005|accessdate=March 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was persuaded by a friend to try out for a play titled ''The Death and Life of Sneaky Fitch'' where Mochrie played the role of the undertaker.&lt;ref name=santa/&gt; He was hooked when he got his first laugh, which paved the way for a career in entertainment.&lt;ref name=mockery/&gt; After graduating from high school, where he was [[valedictorian]],&lt;ref name="comedycouch"&gt;{{cite web|first=Guy|last=MacPherson|url=http://www.comedycouch.com/interviews/cmochrie2.htm|title=Colin Mochrie Interview|publisher=The Comedy Couch|date=November 27, 2007|accessdate=July 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mochrie attended the [[Studio 58]] theatre school in Vancouver for four years, where he discovered the art of improvisational comedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Bridget|last=Byrne|title=Improv crew popping up|work=[[San Antonio Express-News]]|page=4F|date=December 22, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===Improvisational beginnings===
Upon graduation from Studio 58, Mochrie found his first line of work as a member of the Vancouver TheatreSports League.&lt;ref name=mockery/&gt; He started working with the group in 1980. Fame was slow to start, as Mochrie "literally had to pull people out of McDonald's to come see the shows."&lt;ref name=comedycouch/&gt; Mochrie originally had parts in plays while working for the group, though after a time working for the TheatreSports League became a full-time job for Mochrie.&lt;ref name=comedycouch/&gt; He met fellow improvisor [[Ryan Stiles]] during this time. He was visiting a mutual friend in [[New Zealand]] when Stiles was doing comedy at Punchlines. After the two met, Stiles and Mochrie began working at TheatreSports together.&lt;ref name=comedycouch/&gt; Though it has been stated that the two met while members of [[The Second City]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Serena|last=Markstrom|title=Improv troupe rolls with it and rocks the house|work=[[Eugene Register-Guard]]|page=14|date=June 15, 2007|accessdate=July 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; the pair were already close friends, according to both Mochrie and Susan Trimbee, the former manager of The Second City Toronto (1985-1988).&lt;ref name=comedycouch/&gt;

Following [[Expo '86]], Mochrie ended his tenure with the Vancouver TheatreSports League and moved to [[Toronto]]. Once there, Mochrie auditioned for The Second City comedy troupe, where Stiles was working.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newhampshire.com/article.aspx?headline=Colin+Mochrie%2C+Brad+Sherwood+head+for+Capitol+Center&amp;articleid=2526|title=Colin Mochrie, Brad Sherwood head for Capitol Center|date=November 13, 2008|work=[[New Hampshire Union Leader]]|accessdate=July 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began performing with the Second City National Touring Company where he met [[Debra McGrath]], who was the director of the company at the time.&lt;ref name=mockery/&gt; The two were married in 1989 and had a child, Kinley, in 1990.

Mochrie worked for The Second City for three years, co-writing and starring in three productions and directing three seasons of their national touring company. As a member of the touring company, he performed in many skits, including one where he and two others are at a bar, and they help him to rewrite an anecdote from his youth involving his father taking him to a [[baseball]] game; and a five-minute version of a [[James Bond]] movie, complete with Mochrie in a downhill ski chase and parachuting off a cliff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Henry|last=Mietkiewicz|title= Second City Hits A New Plateau|work=[[Toronto Star]]|date=June 7, 1989|page=B2|accessdate=August 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1988–1998===
Upon finishing his stint with Second City in 1988, Mochrie's career was quiet for a while as he spent some time with his new wife and child. In 1989, he auditioned for the new British [[Channel 4]] improv show ''[[Whose Line Is It Anyway? (UK TV series)|Whose Line Is It Anyway?]]'', but did not make the cut.&lt;ref name=branswell&gt;{{cite news|first=Helen|last=Branswell|title=Toronto Comic Becomes British Celeb|work=Toronto Star|page=B4|date=August 25, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mochrie has stated that the audition was a good learning experience because while improv is about setting other people up to be funny, auditions should be about giving yourself the chance to stand out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rosscarey.com/2011/07/28/episode-40-featuring-colin-mochrie/ |title=Episode 40: Featuring Colin Mochrie « Conversations with Ross |publisher=Rosscarey.com |date=July 28, 2011 |accessdate=November 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He moved to [[Los Angeles]] the following year, and again auditioned for ''Whose Line'', this time making the cut and was asked to fly to London. He appeared on one episode and was again let go.&lt;ref name=hollywood&gt;{{cite news|first=Rob|last=Salem|title=Beating Hollywood at its own game|page=E1|date=August 9, 1998|work=Toronto Star|accessdate=November 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third time he auditioned, he earned a regular spot on the show. He spent seven years as a regular on ''Whose Line Is It Anyway?'' and remained a cast member until the show's end in 1998.

After the British version of the show ended its run, Mochrie joined the [[United States|American]] version of ''Whose Line'' hosted by [[Drew Carey]] on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. He was brought on alongside [[Ryan Stiles]], who was also a regular member of the UK cast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ABC charts new series strategy|first=Rob|last=Salem|work=Toronto Star|date=July 19, 1998|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mochrie appeared on every episode from its debut in August 1998 to its finale in 2006. He noted his favourite games as "Scenes From a Hat", where he would have to act out scenes based on suggestions by audience members, and "Whose Line" where he and Stiles would act out a scene and have to add in lines written on pieces of paper.&lt;ref name=northernstars&gt;{{cite news|title=Who is Colin Mochrie Anyway?|first=Peggy|last=Hill|work=Northern Stars Magazine|date=August 27, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; He felt that his weak spots were the musical segments and the "Hoedown" game, which he said was the only time during the show when he felt total fear. Mochrie, who cannot sing, usually [[spoken word|spoke]] his lines instead of singing them.&lt;ref name=northernstars/&gt;

His co-stars on the show would frequently mock him for being Canadian and for his receding hairline, though this did not come until later as very early on in the UK version, Mochrie still had a fairly full head of hair. Instead, the bald jokes were done at the expense of the UK host, [[Clive Anderson]]. In the American version, he would often perform the female role in certain frequently-performed skits, such as "Whose Line" and "Two Line Vocabulary".  In the few times he played the man in the scene, the producers were making further fun of his baldness (e.g. Colin was [[Samson]], and Ryan was his girlfriend, and Samson had lost all his strength because Ryan had cut off his hair). While initially the co-anchor in the beginning, he would be cast as the anchor in the "Weird Newscasters" segment (the position had previously been played by Greg Proops and Brad Sherwood), wherein he would frequently begin by announcing himself with a fictitiously humorous name (e.g. Jose Canyousee) and continue with a fake news report that ended in an unexpected and pun-laden segue. Colin also excelled at the game, "Newsflash" where he would go in front of a Green Screen, pretend to be a News Reporter, and try to guess what was happening. At one point, the Newsflash was of himself. 

According to his agent Jeff Andrews, during the airing of ''Whose Line'' Mochrie was better known in Canada as a "commercial king", performing as characters such the Detergent Crusader for Sunlight detergent.&lt;ref name=branswell/&gt; In March 2005, a [[Nabisco]] advertising campaign starred Mochrie as the "Snack Fairy", in which he wears a [[ballet tutu]] over ordinary slacks and a shirt. At the end of each commercial, he declares "Snack happy!" and waves his scepter while sporting a smile.

Mochrie remained active elsewhere during his tenure as a ''Whose Line'' member. In early 1994, he played the role of [[Characters of The Brady Bunch#Mike Brady|Mike Brady]] in a musical version of ''[[The Brady Bunch]]'', directed by fellow Second City member Bruce Pirrie. In the production, Mochrie plays the character as caffeine-fuelled, jittery, and neurotic, an exaggeration of the Mike Brady television character, who often had a coffee in his hand on the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Jamie|last=Tennant|title=Here's the story of a play named Brady|work=[[The Hamilton Spectator]]|date=February 3, 1994|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly before his move to the US version of ''Whose Line'' in 1998, Mochrie starred in ''[[Supertown Challenge]]'' as the host of game shows, which the show spoofed. He also appeared in several episodes of the Canadian improvisational comedy series ''[[Improv Heaven and Hell]]''.

===1999–present===
In an interview, it was revealed that in 1999 Mochrie worked on the [[Miloš Forman]] film ''[[Man on the Moon (film)|Man on the Moon]]'', but his scenes were deleted from the final movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sbindependent.org/node/192|title=An Interview with...Colin Mochrie|first=Ian|last=Rice|work=[[Stony Brook Independent]]|date=March 2, 2005|accessdate=September 2, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100914103252/http://www.sbindependent.org/node/192|archivedate=September 14, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Mochrie starred in the Canadian comedy series ''[[Blackfly (TV series)|Blackfly]]''. He appeared in ''[[22 Minutes|This Hour Has 22 Minutes]]'' on [[CBC Television]] from 2001 through 2003, and on the [[WB Television Network]] series ''[[Drew Carey's Green Screen Show]]'' in 2004. Mochrie starred in ''[[Getting Along Famously]]'' in 2006. He was a guest star in three episodes of ''[[The Drew Carey Show]]'': "She's Gotta Have It" (1999), "[[Drew Live]]" (1999), and "[[Drew Live II]]" (2000).  He also appeared on [[Nickelodeon]]'s ''[[Figure It Out]]'' as a celebrity guest panelist; in one segment of the show, he was [[Slime (You Can't Do That on Television)#Slime|slimed]].  He had a [[One-liner joke|one-liner]] in the "[[Bad Hare Day]]" episode of ''[[Goosebumps (TV series)|Goosebumps]]'', and he made special guest appearances in several episodes of ''[[The Red Green Show]]''.

Since 2002, Mochrie and ''Whose Line'' co-star [[Brad Sherwood]] have intermittently toured North America as a two-man stage show called "An Evening with Colin and Brad," playing primarily in small theatre venues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colinandbradshow.com/|title=An Evening with Colin and Brad|website=www.colinandbradshow.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; A DVD of their performances, "Colin &amp; Brad: Two Man Group" was released on March 8, 2011.

In 2003, Mochrie, [[Leslie Nielsen]], [[Wayne Gretzky]], and [[Roy Halladay]] appeared in print and television advertisements to encourage people to visit [[Toronto]] after the [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome|SARS]] outbreak that struck the city.

In May 2004, he hosted a [[wikt:tongue-in-cheek|tongue-in-cheek]] guide to surviving animal attacks on [[Animal Planet]] known as ''Wild Survival Guide''. He has done a commercial supporting [[Habitat For Humanity]]. He appeared briefly in a commercial for Buckley's Cough Syrup, and he was featured in a commercial for [[New York Fries]], manning a [[steamroller]]. He appeared on ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'' as the [[superhero]] Overly Sensitive Man (inspired from ''Whose Line'').

By 2004, Mochrie was appearing in so many media spots that a new Canadian television series, ''[[Corner Gas]]'', made light of it by having him do a [[cameo appearance]] in the tenth episode. In 2005, Mochrie appeared in "Burnt Toast", a series of eight comedic mini-operas, each depicting a different stage of a romantic relationship in a contemporary setting, produced by Canada's [[Rhombus Media]]. He also appeared in an episode of ''[[The Surreal Gourmet]]''.

Along with [[Rosie O'Donnell]], Mochrie hosts a video introduction to a tour of the bakery in the Pacific Wharf area of [[Disney California Adventure Park]].  In the video, he helps explain how [[sourdough bread]] is made.  On December 25, 2005, the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] premièred the TV movie ''The Magical Gathering''. Mochrie starred in this, and his daughter Kinley co-starred as Mochrie's character at a younger age.  In February 2007, he made a guest appearance as a priest in the seventh episode of ''[[Little Mosque on the Prairie]]'', a Canadian television comedy series.

On March 28, 2007, Mochrie and his ''Whose Line'' costar [[Brad Sherwood]] hosted part of the [[Press Correspondents' Dinner with the President]]. At that event, Sherwood and Mochrie featured Deputy [[White House Chief of Staff]] [[Karl Rove]] [[rapping]].  Rove's only line was "MC Rove". On August 29, 2007, it was announced that Mochrie would host the Canadian version of the game show ''[[Are You Smarter Than a Canadian 5th Grader?|Are You Smarter Than A 5th Grader?]]''. The first of five episodes aired on October 25, 2007. As a result, Mochrie became the fifth member of the American ''Whose Line?'' cast to become a game show host, after colleagues Brad Sherwood (''[[The Dating Game]]'' and ''[[The Big Moment]]''), [[Greg Proops]] (''[[VS. (game show)|VS.]]'', ''[[Head Games (game show)|Head Games]]'' and ''Rendez-View''), [[Wayne Brady]] (''[[Don't Forget the Lyrics!]] and [[Let's Make A Deal]]''), and Drew Carey (''[[Power of 10 (U.S. game show)|Power of 10]]'' and ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]'').

{{Wikinews|Comedian Colin Mochrie to host Canadian "5th Grader" game show}}
Mochrie hosted the only season, consisting of five episodes, of [[Are You Smarter than a Canadian 5th Grader?]], which began airing on October 25, 2007.

In 2010, he acted in the forthcoming Canadian television sitcom ''[[She's the Mayor]]'', scheduled to debut in 2011.&lt;ref name="hamilton"&gt;[http://www.thespec.com/article/753892 "She's the Mayor finds laughs in Hamilton"]. ''[[Hamilton Spectator]]'', April 16, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 19, 2010, Mochrie starred as the divorce lawyer working on the case of Spinner and Emma in ''[[Degrassi Takes Manhattan]]''.

The image of Mochrie's face is used extensively in [[Animutation]], a style of [[Macromedia Flash|Flash]] animation. [[Neil Cicierega]], the father of Animutation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rempel|first=Shauna|title=Copy, paste, animate; Pop culture crudely skewered in animutation Most shorts mash up celebrity faces, Japanese songs|newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]|date=August 26, 2006|page=H3}}&lt;/ref&gt; would place Mochrie in almost every Animutation he made, making the inclusion of him in Animutation somewhat of a [[running gag]]. Mochrie is aware of his status among Animutation artists and fans, having been quoted, "It was very odd when I first saw the animutations. Obviously, the animators are more than a little crazy, but I am very proud of my standing in the animutation arena and hope that some day I can make millions off of it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://colinmochrie.com/askcolin2.cfm |title=Ask Colin Mochrie |work=Colinmochrie.com |publisher=J.

In 2011, Mochrie appeared as a regular cast member on ''[[Drew Carey's Improv-A-Ganza]]'' on [[Game Show Network|GSN]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mipasthiewyebut|first=Keith|title=Charlie Sheen's Improntu Improv with Drew Carey|url=http://www.etonline.com/tv/109254_Charlie_Sheen_s_Impromptu_Improv_with_Drew_Carey/index.html|work=ET HD|accessdate=June 4, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110402044954/http://www.etonline.com/tv/109254_Charlie_Sheen_s_Impromptu_Improv_with_Drew_Carey/index.html|archivedate=April 2, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Mochrie starred in the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] improv comedy series ''[[Trust Us with Your Life]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About this show: Trust us with your life|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/showatch/trust-us-with-your-life/|publisher=The Futon Critic|accessdate=July 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mochrie returned for the [[The CW|CW network]]'s revival of ''Whose Line Is It Anyway?'' in the summer of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ng|first=Philiana|title='Whose Line Is It Anyway?' Being Revived by The CW|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/line-is-being-revived-by-425622#|accessdate=March 1, 2013|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=March 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mochrie had a recurring role in the short-lived television comedy series [[Working the Engels]].

In 2017 Colin Mochrie made a cameo appearance complete with his trademark dry humour, as Ralph Fellows a hotel detective in an episode (11/3) of the Canadian detective TV series [[Murdoch Mysteries]].

==Personal life==
Mochrie lives with his wife, Canadian actress [[Debra McGrath]], in [[Toronto]]. The two have been married since 8 January 1989 and together, they have a daughter, Kinley Mochrie (b. 3 September 1990 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada). In 2017, Mochrie, with his daughter's permission, revealed that she was [[transgender]] on [[Twitter]] and used the social media platform to express his support and love for her.&lt;ref name="ny-jan2017"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Kate Feldman|title=‘Whose Line Is It Anyway’ star Colin Mochrie defends transgender daughter online|publisher=New York Daily News|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/line-star-colin-mochrie-defends-transgender-daughter-article-1.2947244|accessdate=January 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jackontheweb2017"&gt;{{cite news|title='Whose Line' Star Colin Mochrie, Opens Up About Transgender Daughter|url=http://jackontheweb.cbslocal.com/2017/01/18/whose-line-star-colin-mochrie-opens-up-about-transgender-daughter/|accessdate=29 May 2017|date=January 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/colin-kinley-mochrie-transition-1.4021271|title=How the rule of improv helped Colin Mochrie support transgender daughter {{!}} CBC News|work=CBC|access-date=2018-02-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
