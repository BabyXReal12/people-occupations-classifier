'''ZaSu Pitts''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|eɪ|z|uː|_|ˈ|p|ɪ|t|s}};&lt;ref name=CandyHits/&gt; born '''Eliza Susan Pitts''';&lt;ref name=Salemson/&gt; January 3, 1894 – June 7, 1963){{efn|Pitts' year of birth is difficult to pinpoint. Kansas did not keep birth records prior to 1911. Many sources, including ''Halliwell's Filmgoer's Companion'', give 1898 as the year; her obituary in the ''New York Times'' gives 1900, which also appears on her headstone; Pitts biographer Stumpf gives 1894&lt;ref name=Stumpf/&gt; and ''Notable American Women'' points out that the 1900 US Census gives her age as six years old.&lt;ref name=Salemson/&gt;}} was an American actress who starred in many [[silent film|silent]] [[drama film|dramas]], including [[Erich von Stroheim]]'s epic silent film ''[[Greed (film)|Greed]]'', and comedies, transitioning successfully to mostly comedy films with the advent of [[sound film]]s.

==Early life==
Eliza Susan Pitts was born in [[Parsons, Kansas]], to Rulandus and Nelly (née Shay) Pitts; she was the third of four children. Her father, who had lost a leg while serving in the [[76th New York Volunteer Infantry|76th New York Infantry]] in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], had settled the family in [[Kansas]] by the time ZaSu was born.&lt;ref name=76NY/&gt;

The names of her father's sisters, Eliza and Susan, were purportedly the basis for the nickname "ZaSu", i.e., to satisfy competing family interests. She later adopted the nickname professionally and legally. It has been (incorrectly) spelled as Zazu Pitts in some film credits and news articles.  Although the name is commonly mispronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|z|æ|z|uː}} {{respell|ZAZ|oo}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|z|eɪ|s|uː}} {{respell|ZAY|soo}}, or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|z|eɪ|z|uː}} {{respell|ZAY|zoo}}, in her 1963 book ''Candy Hits'' (p.&amp;nbsp;15), Pitts herself gives the correct pronunciation as "Say Zoo" {{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|eɪ|z|uː}}, recounting that [[Mary Pickford]] had predicted, "[M]any will mispronounce it", and adding, "How right [she] was."

In 1903, when she was nine years old, her family moved to [[Santa Cruz, California]], to seek a warmer climate and better job opportunities. Her childhood home at 208 Lincoln Street still stands. She attended [[Santa Cruz High School]], where she participated in school theatricals.&lt;ref name="lib"/&gt;

==Career==
[[File:Zasu Pitts Who's Who on the Screen.jpg|thumb|left|200px|upright|c. 1920]]
Pitts made her stage debut in 1914–15 doing school and local community theater in Santa Cruz.  Going to Los Angeles in 1916, at the age of 22, she spent many months seeking work as a film extra.  Finally, she was discovered for substantive roles in films by screenwriter [[Frances Marion]], who cast Pitts as an orphaned slavey (child of work) in the [[silent film]], ''[[A Little Princess (1917 film)|A Little Princess]]'' (1917), starring Pickford.

Pitts' popularity grew following a series of Universal one-reeler comedies and earned her first feature-length lead in [[King Vidor]]'s ''Better Times'' (1919).  The following year, she married her first husband, [[Tom Gallery]], with whom she was paired in several films, including ''Heart of Twenty'' (1920), ''Bright Eyes'' (1921), ''Patsy'' (1921), and ''A Daughter of Luxury'' (1922).  In 1924, the actress, now a reputable comedy farceuse, was given the greatest tragic role of her career in [[Erich von Stroheim]]'s {{frac|9|1|2}}-hour epic ''[[Greed (film)|Greed]]'' (1924).  The surprise casting initially shocked Hollywood, but showed that Pitts could draw tears with her doleful demeanor as well as laughs.  Having been extensively edited prior to release—the final theatrical cut ran just over two hours—the movie failed initially at the box office, but has since been restored to over four hours and is considered one of the [[List of films considered the best|greatest films ever made]].&lt;ref&gt;Koszarski, Richard (1983). [https://books.google.com/books?id=7V4_UVsU6VcC&amp;pg=PA168 ''Von: The Life and Films of Erich Von Stroheim'']. Hal Leonard Corporation. p. 168. {{ISBN|0879109548}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klepper, Robert K. (2005). [https://books.google.com/books?id=4ymSCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA286 ''Silent Films, 1877-1996: A Critical Guide to 646 Movies'']. McFarland. p. 286. {{ISBN|0786421649}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Based on her performance, von Stroheim labeled Pitts "the greatest dramatic actress".  He also featured her in his films ''The Honeymoon'' (1928), ''[[The Wedding March (1928 film)|The Wedding March]]'' (1928), ''[[War Nurse]]'' (1930) and ''Walking Down Broadway'', released as ''[[Hello, Sister!]]'' (1933).

[[File:Better Times 1919.jpg|thumb|[[David Butler (director)|David Butler]] and ZaSu Pitts look lovingly at each other while [[Jack McDonald (actor)|Jack McDonald]] glares in a scene still for the 1919 silent drama ''Better Times''.]]
Pitts enjoyed her greatest fame in the early 1930s, often starring in [[B movies]] and comedy short films, teamed with [[Thelma Todd]].{{efn|Todd and she are listed by ''Variety'' as the top two actors in number of film roles in the early 1930s (pre-1933).&lt;ref name=Variety/&gt;}} She played secondary parts in many films. Her [[stock character|stock persona]] (a fretful, flustered, worried [[spinster]]) made her instantly recognizable and was often imitated in cartoons and other films. She starred in a number of [[Hal Roach]] short films and features, and co-starred in a series of feature-length comedies with [[Slim Summerville]]. Switching between comedy short films and features, by the advent of sound, she was relegated to comedy roles. A bitter disappointment was when she was replaced in the classic war drama ''[[All Quiet on the Western Front (1930 film)|All Quiet on the Western Front]]'' (1930) by [[Beryl Mercer]] after her initial appearance in previews drew unintentional laughs, despite her intense performance. She had viewers rolling in the aisles in ''[[Finn and Hattie]]'' (1931), ''[[The Guardsman]]'' (1931), ''[[Blondie of the Follies]]'' (1932), ''[[Sing and Like It]]'' (1934), and ''[[Ruggles of Red Gap]]'' (1935). In 1936 and 1937 she portrayed [[Hildegarde Withers]] in two movies, succeeding [[Edna May Oliver]] as the spinster sleuth, but they were not well received.&lt;ref name=Palmer2013/&gt;

In the 1940s, she found work in radio, trading banter with [[Bing Crosby]], [[Al Jolson]], [[W.C. Fields]], and [[Rudy Vallee]], among others. Pitts' activities on radio included playing Miss Mamie Wayne on the soap opera ''[[Big Sister (radio)|Big Sister]]''.&lt;ref name=Stumpf/&gt; She appeared several times on the earliest ''[[Fibber McGee and Molly]]'' show, playing a dizzy dame constantly looking for a husband.

In 1944, Pitts tackled Broadway, making her debut in the mystery, ''[[Ramshackle Inn]]''. The play, written expressly for her, did well, and she took the show on the road in later years. Postwar films continued to give Pitts the chance to play comic snoops and flighty relatives in such fare as ''[[Life with Father (film)|Life with Father]]'' (1947), but in the 1950s, she started focusing on television. This culminated in her best-known series role, playing [[second banana]] to [[Gale Storm]] on [[CBS]]'s ''[[The Gale Storm Show]]'' ([[1956 in television|1956]]) (also known as ''Oh, Susannah'') in the role of Elvira Nugent ("Nugie"), the shipboard [[beautician]]. In 1961, Pitts was cast opposite [[Earle Hodgins]] in the episode "Lonesome's Gal" on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] sitcom, ''[[Guestward, Ho!]]'', set on a [[dude ranch]] in [[New Mexico]]. In 1962, Pitts appeared in an episode of CBS's ''[[Perry Mason (TV series)|Perry Mason]]'', "The Case of the Absent Artist". Her final role was as Gertie, the switchboard operator in the [[Stanley Kramer]] comedy epic ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' (1963).

==Personal life==
{{moresources|section|date=July 2017}}
[[File:ZaSu Pitts in Ruggles of Red Gap trailer.jpg|thumb|left|Zasu Pitts in 1935]]
Pitts was married to actor Thomas Sarsfield Gallery from 1920 to 1933. Gallery became a Los Angeles boxing promoter and later a TV executive. The couple had two children: Ann Gallery (born 1922)&lt;!-- still alive?? --&gt; and Donald Michael "Sonny" Gallery (né Marvin Carville La Marr),&lt;!-- still alive?? --&gt; whom they adopted and renamed after the 1926 death of his mother (and Pitts' friend), silent film actress [[Barbara La Marr]]. In 1933, she married John Edward "Eddie" Woodall, with whom she remained until her death.

She was a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], and became active in the party.&lt;ref name=Stumpf/&gt;

Declining health dominated Pitts' later years, particularly after she was diagnosed with cancer in the mid-1950s. She continued to work, appearing on TV and making brief appearances in ''[[The Thrill of It All (film)|The Thrill of It All]]'' (1963) and ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]''. She died June 7, 1963, aged 69, in Hollywood and was interred at [[Holy Cross Cemetery, Culver City]].&lt;ref name=Stumpf/&gt; Pitts wrote a book of candy recipes, ''Candy Hits by ZaSu Pitts'', which was published posthumously in 1963.

==Legacy==
ZaSu Pitts was inducted to the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] on February 8, 1960 for her contribution to motion pictures.&lt;ref name=hwof/&gt; Her star is on the south side of the 6500 block of Hollywood Boulevard.&lt;ref name=LATstar/&gt;

In 1994, she was honored with her image on a [[List of people on stamps of the United States|United States postage stamp]] along with luminaries such as [[Rudolph Valentino]], [[Clara Bow]] and [[Charlie Chaplin]] as part of The Silent Screen Stars stamp set, designed by caricaturist [[Al Hirschfeld]].&lt;ref name="lib"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Arago/&gt; In [[Parsons, Kansas]], there is a star tile at the entrance to the Parsons Theatre to commemorate her.&lt;ref name=KSpedia/&gt;

In the film ''[[Never Give a Sucker an Even Break]]'', [[W.C. Fields]] asks his niece, played by [[Gloria Jean]], "Don't you want to go to school? You wanna be dumb like ZaSu Pitts?"    Gloria Jean replied "She only acts like that in pictures.  I like her".&lt;ref name="Neibaur2010" /&gt;

Actress [[Mae Questel]], who performed character voices in [[Max Fleischer]]'s [[Popeye the Sailor]] and Betty Boop cartoons, reportedly based the fluttering utterances of [[Olive Oyl]] on Pitts.&lt;ref name=Eagan2010/&gt;
