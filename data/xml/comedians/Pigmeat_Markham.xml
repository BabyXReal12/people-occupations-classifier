'''Dewey "Pigmeat" Markham''' (April 18, 1904 – December 13, 1981)&lt;ref name="allmusic"&gt;{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p195/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=Pigmeat Markham Biography |accessdate=2008-02-03 |last=Deming |first=Mark |work=[[AllMusic]] |publisher=[[All Media Guide]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; was an American entertainer.&lt;ref name="registry"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aaregistry.org/historic_events/view/pigmeat-markham-comedian-extraordinaire|title= Pigmeat Markham, Comedian Extraordinaire.|accessdate=2010-05-10|year= 2005|work=The African American Registry}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though best known as a comedian, Markham was also a singer, dancer, and actor.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; His nickname came from a stage routine, in which he declared himself to be "Sweet Poppa Pigmeat". He was sometimes credited in films as '''David "Pigmeat" Markham''' or  '''Pigmeat "Alamo" Markham'''.

==Early life and career==
[[File:Mr. Smith Goes Ghost poster.jpg|thumb|left|Poster for the 1940 film ''Mr. Smith Goes Ghost'']]

He was born in the community of [[Hayti, Durham, North Carolina]].&lt;ref name="registry"/&gt; His family was the most prominent on their street, which came to be called (and later officially named) Markham Street in the [[Hayti District]]. Markham began his career in traveling music and [[American burlesque|burlesque]] shows. For a time he was a member of [[Bessie Smith]]'s Traveling Revue in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.phillipscollection.org/education/exploring-The%20North.pdf |title= Primary Source 45 |accessdate= 2008-01-20 |format = PDF |work= Jacob Lawrence and The Migration Series |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080228052639/http://www.phillipscollection.org/education/exploring-The%20North.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = February 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, he claimed he originated the ''Truckin' ''dance which became nationally popular at the start of the 1930s. In the 1940s he started making film appearances. In 1964 he recorded "[[Open the Door, Richard]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p195/discography|pure_url=yes}}|title=allmusic ((( Pigmeat Markham &gt; Discography &gt; Main Albums )))|publisher=www.allmusic.com|accessdate=2008-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Markham was a familiar act at New York's famed [[Apollo Theater]] where he wore [[blackface]] makeup and huge painted white lips, despite complaints the vaudeville tradition was degrading. He probably played at the Apollo more frequently than any other performer.&lt;ref name=fox&gt;{{cite book |last= Fox |first= Ted |title= Showtime at the Apollo |publisher= Da Capo |year= 1983 |isbn= 9780030605338|pages = 94}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Starting in the 1950s Pigmeat Markham began appearing on television, making multiple appearances on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thewoodlawncemetery.org/africanamerican.html |title= African American Legacy of The Woodlawn Cemetery |accessdate= 2008-01-20 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080104091819/http://www.thewoodlawncemetery.org/africanamerican.html |archivedate= January 4, 2008 |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His boisterous, indecorous "heyeah (here) come da judge" [[schtick]], which made a mockery of formal courtroom etiquette, became his signature routine. Markham would sit at an elevated judge's bench (often in a black graduation cap-and-gown, to look more impressive), and deal with a series of comic miscreants.  He would often deliver his "judgments", as well as express frustration with the accused, by leaning over the bench and smacking the accused with an inflated bladder-balloon. He had hit comedy recordings in the 1960s on [[Chess Records]], and saw his routine's entry line become a [[catchphrase]] on the ''[[Rowan &amp; Martin's Laugh-In]]'' [[NBC]] television show, as did his phrase "Look that up in your [[Funk and Wagnalls]]".

Markham's most famous routine was "discovered" by the general public only after [[Sammy Davis, Jr.]] had performed it as a guest on the March 25, 1968 episode of ''Laugh-In''. Due to the years of racial segregation in the entertainment world, he was not widely known by white audiences, and had almost exclusively performed on the "[[chitlin' circuit]]" of vaudeville, theatres, and night clubs&lt;ref name="allmusic"/&gt; and appeared in several [[Race movie|race film]]s, including [[William D. Alexander]]'s 1949 revue film ''[[Burlesque in Harlem]]'', which documented the chitlin' circuit.

The phenomenal ripple effect of Davis's version of "the judge" led to Markham's opportunity to perform his signature Judge character himself as a ''Laugh-In'' regular during the 1968–69 television season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.aliciapatterson.org/APF0302/Watkins/Watkins.html |title= Black Humor: On The Real Side |accessdate= 2008-01-20 |last= Watkins |first= Mel |year= 1979 |work= APF Reporter Vol. 3 #2 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080119215936/http://www.aliciapatterson.org/APF0302/Watkins/Watkins.html |archivedate= January 19, 2008 |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Archie Campbell]] later adapted Markham's routine, performing as "Justus O'Peace," on the [[American country music|country]] version of ''Laugh-In'', ''[[Hee Haw]]'', which borrowed heavily from the [[minstrel show]] tradition.

Thanks to his ''Heyeah come da judge'' routine, which originally was accompanied by music with a [[funk]]y beat, Pigmeat Markham is regarded as a forerunner of [[rapping|rap]].&lt;ref name=rap&gt;{{cite news|last=Jones|first=Alistair|title=Reasons rhyme for a history under raps|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/arts/books/reasons-rhyme-for-a-history-under-raps/story-e6frg8nf-1226011610605|accessdate=November 3, 2012|newspaper=www.theaustralian.com.au|date=February 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His song "[[Here Comes the Judge (Pigmeat Markham song)|Here Comes the Judge]]" peaked at number 19 on the ''[[Billboard Hot 100|Billboard]]''&lt;ref name=md&gt;(click on "Read More" once at the site) {{ cite web |url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=pigmeat markham|chart=all}} |author=Mark Deming |title=Pigmeat Markham at Billboard.com |publisher=All Music Guide |accessdate=December 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other charts in 1968. He published an autobiography, ''Here Come the Judge!'', in the wake of his ''Laugh-In'' success.

==Death==
[[File:Dewey Markham Crypt 12-2008.jpg|thumb|The crypt of Dewey Markham in [[Woodlawn Cemetery (Bronx)|Woodlawn Cemetery]], [[The Bronx]] [[New York (state)|New York]]]]

Markham died of a stroke at [[Montefiore Medical Center]] in [[the Bronx]] at the age of 77.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news |author=C.
