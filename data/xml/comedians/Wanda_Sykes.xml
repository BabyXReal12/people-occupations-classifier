In 2004, ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' named Sykes as one of the 25 funniest people in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Best of the Rest|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,600311_2,00.html|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=March 19, 2004|accessdate=December 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is also known for her role as Barb Baran on [[CBS]]' ''[[The New Adventures of Old Christine]]'' (2006–10) and for appearances on [[HBO]]'s ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'' (2001–11).

==Early life==
Born in [[Portsmouth, Virginia]],&lt;ref name= rising&gt;Belcher, Walt (August 17, 2001). "Wanda Sykes' Star is Rising". ''The Tampa Tribune''. p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Sykes' family moved to [[Maryland]] when she was in third grade.&lt;ref&gt;Bonko, Larry (January 6, 2005). "Wild, blue Wanda". ''The Virginian-Pilot'' (Norfolk, Virginia). p. E9.&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother, Marion Louise (née Peoples), worked as a banker, and her father, Harry Ellsworth Sykes, was a [[Colonel (United States)|U.S. Army colonel]] employed at [[the Pentagon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/20/arts/television/wanda-sykes-finds-ancestors-thanks-to-henry-louis-gates-jr.html | work=The New York Times | first=Felicia R. | last=Lee | title=Wanda Sykes Finds Ancestors Thanks to Henry Louis Gates Jr | date=March 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sykes' family history was researched for an episode of the 2012 PBS genealogy program ''Finding Your Roots With [[Henry Louis Gates Jr.]]'' Her ancestry was traced back to a 1683 court case involving her paternal ninth great-grandmother Elizabeth Banks, a free white woman and indentured servant, who gave birth to a biracial child, Mary Banks, fathered by a slave, who inherited her mother's free status. According to historian [[Ira Berlin]], a specialist in the history of American slavery, the Sykes family history is "the only such case that I know of in which it is possible to trace a black family rooted in freedom from the late 17th century to the present."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/20/arts/television/wanda-sykes-finds-ancestors-thanks-to-henry-louis-gates-jr.html |title=Family Tree’s Startling Roots |date=March 19, 2012 |work=The New York Times |first=Felicia R. |last=Lee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The couple also became parents on April 27, 2009, when Alex gave birth to a pair of fraternal twins, daughter Olivia Lou and son Lucas Claude.&lt;ref name= people&gt;{{cite news |author=Julie Jordan |url= http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20278746,00.html |title= Wanda Sykes Becomes Mom of Twins! |work=People |date=May 13, 2009 |accessdate= May 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sykes only came out to her conservative mother Marion and father Harry when she was 40, who both initially had difficulty accepting her homosexuality. They declined to attend her wedding with Alex, which led to a brief period of estrangement; they have since reconciled with Sykes and are now proud grandparents to the couple's children.&lt;ref name=express&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/showbiz/439668/Wanda-Sykes-fell-out-with-parents-after-coming-out|title=Wanda Sykes fell out with parents after 'coming out'|work=Express|date=October 28, 2013|accessdate=July 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a September 19, 2011, appearance on ''[[The Ellen DeGeneres Show]]'', Sykes announced that she had been diagnosed earlier in the year with [[ductal carcinoma in situ]] (DCIS). Although DCIS is a non-invasive "stage zero breast cancer", Sykes had elected to have a bilateral [[mastectomy]] in order to lower her chances of getting breast cancer.&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, Stephen M. [http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20531010,00.html?xid=rss-topheadlines "Wanda Sykes: I Had a Double Mastectomy"]. ''[[People (magazine)|People]]''. September 23, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Sykes splits time living in both Los Angeles and [[Media, Pennsylvania]], a suburb of Philadelphia.&lt;ref&gt;"Molly Eichel, "Wanda Sykes loves the small-town life of Media", ''Philadelphia Daily News'', May 1, 2013." [http://www.philly.com/philly/entertainment/celebrities/20130501_Wanda_Sykes_loves_the_small-town_life_of_Media.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Activism===
Sykes publicly expressed being devastated when California voters passed state [[Proposition 8]]. She said: "with the legislation that they passed, I can’t sit by and just watch. I just can’t do it."&lt;ref name=advocate2&gt;{{cite news|first1=Christopher|last1=Lisotta|first2=Corey|last2=Scholibo|url=http://www.advocate.com/news_detail_ektid66219.asp|title=Wanda Sykes Comes Out Amid Passing of Prop. 8|work=The Advocate|date=November 15, 2008|accessdate=November 17, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105194121/http://www2.advocate.com/news_detail_ektid66219.asp|archivedate=January 5, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Sarah Warn|title=Wanda Sykes Comes Out as Gay and Married|url=http://www.afterellen.com/people/2008/11/wanda-sykes-comes-out|date=November 15, 2008|accessdate=November 22, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203200016/http://www.afterellen.com/people/2008/11/wanda-sykes-comes-out|archivedate=December 3, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has continued to be active in [[same-sex marriage]] issues hosting events and emceeing fundraisers.

She has been an outspoken supporter of [[Detroit]]'s [[Ruth Ellis Center]] after the organization's staff sent Sykes a letter asking her to visit during her 2010 tour's stop in Detroit.&lt;ref name="btl710"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.pridesource.com/article.html?article=42165 | title=Wanda Sykes visits Ruth Ellis Center | work=[[Between the Lines (newspaper)|Between the Lines]] | date=July 8, 2010 | accessdate=August 1, 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131025020937/http://www.pridesource.com/article.html?article=42165 | archivedate=October 25, 2013 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hour912"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.hourdetroit.com/Hour-Detroit/September-2012/No-Laughing-Matter/ | title=Q&amp;A: Wanda Sykes, Ruth Ellis Center Fundraiser Host | author=Mercer, Monica | journal=Hour Detroit |date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="advocate1012"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.advocate.com/youth/2012/10/04/invaluable-lgbt-youth-center-detroit-has-friend-wanda | title=Detroit's Invaluable LGBT Youth Center Has a Friend in Wanda | work=[[The Advocate]] | date=October 4, 2012 | accessdate=August 1, 2013 | author=Broverman, Neal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
