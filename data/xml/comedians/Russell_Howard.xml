==Early life==
Russell was born to Dave and Ninette Howard. He has two younger siblings, twins [[Kerry Howard|Kerry]] and Daniel (born 1982).&lt;ref name="Russell Howard warming up for Good News series 4"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/stage/article5516562.ece | title=Relative Values: Russell Howard and his mother, Ninette |work=The Times |location=UK |date=18 January 2009 | accessdate=8 December 2009|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daniel has epilepsy, to which Howard sometimes refers during his act.

Howard attended [[Perins School]] in [[New Alresford]] and [[Alton College]], both in [[Hampshire]]. He later studied economics at the [[University of the West of England]] in Bristol.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/11-bristol-celebrities-go-school-17024 Where did these 11 Bristol celebrities go to school?]",''Bristol Post'', 2 April 2017 (Accessed 4th April 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Q &amp; A: Comedian Russell Howard|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/you/article-2129376/Q-amp-A-Comedian-Russell-Howard.html|date=14 April 2012|publisher=[[Daily Mail]]|last=Wilson|first=Benji}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===TV and radio work===
In 2004 he was commissioned by [[BBC Radio 1]] to write, sing and perform on the comedy series ''The Milk Run''. Howard has also appeared on the shows ''[[Banter (radio show)|Banter]]'' (hosted by [[Andrew Collins (broadcaster)|Andrew Collins]]) and ''[[Political Animal (radio)|Political Animal]]'' for [[BBC Radio 4]].&lt;ref name=radiohoward&gt;{{cite magazine |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105010705/http://www.national-student.co.uk/pages/magazine/comedy/russell_howard.html |archive-date=5 January 2009 |url=http://www.national-student.co.uk/pages/magazine/comedy/russell_howard.html |title=Russell Howard Interview '06 |work=The National Student Magazine |date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 2010, Howard was a regular panellist on ''Mock the Week''. He has also appeared on ''[[8 Out of 10 Cats]]'', ''[[Would I Lie To You? (TV series)|Would I Lie To You?]]'', ''[[Live at the Apollo (TV series)|Live at the Apollo]]'', ''[[The Secret Policeman's Ball 2008]]'', ''[[Law of the Playground]]'' and ''[[Never Mind the Buzzcocks]]'' ([[List of Never Mind the Buzzcocks episodes|Series 18, Episode 2 and Series 20, Episode 4]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Never Mind the Buzzcocks (a Guests &amp; Air Dates Guide)|url=http://epguides.com/NeverMindtheBuzzcocks/|website=epguides.com|accessdate=30 January 2016|date=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was one of several comedians picked as the best comedy talent from the [[2005 Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] that recorded 10–15-minute spots for the 'Edinburgh and Beyond' show which was aired on [[Paramount Comedy 1]] in the autumn of 2006. The show was filmed at The [[Bloomsbury Theatre]]. From 2009, he took over as compère of this show from [[Al Murray]].&lt;ref name=newcompere&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comedycentral.co.uk/shows/edinburgh-and-beyond |title=Edinburgh And Beyond |work=Comedy Central |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090805164613/http://www.comedycentral.co.uk/shows/edinburgh-and-beyond |archive-date=5 August 2009 |quote=For this latest series, starting Saturday July 25th 2009 Al Murray the Pub Landlord has sadly stepped down as your host and compere. But the good news is that he has been replaced by ''Mock The Week'' star Russell Howard, with his own brand of award-winning comedy.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From November 2006 to July 2008, Russell co-hosted ''[[The Russell Howard Show]]'' on [[BBC 6 Music]] with fellow comedian [[Jon Richardson (entertainer)|Jon Richardson]] in a Sunday morning slot previously hosted by [[Russell Brand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Russell Howard Show|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/6music/shows/russell_howard/|website=BBC 6 Music|accessdate=30 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2006/11_november/02/howard.shtml "Russell Howard presents new show for 6 Music"] – BBC Press Release, 2 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The show continued to air, without Howard, until March 2010. He has since explained that his main reason for leaving the show was that he finds radio "really restrictive" and "I gorge off the audience as a performer, but you can't gauge a reaction on the radio."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.surreymirror.co.uk/Star-interview-Comedian-Russell-Howard-sold-Dorking-Crawley/story-12667330-detail/story.html|title=Star interview: Comedian Russell Howard sold out at Dorking and Crawley|work=Surrey Mirror|date=5 November 2008|access-date=30 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russell was commissioned to make a comedy show called ''[[Russell Howard's Good News]]'', aimed at under-25s, for [[BBC Three]]. The first episode aired on 22 October 2009 and the show ran for seven episodes as well as a "best of" show and a Christmas Special. It went on to become BBC Three's highest ever rating entertainment series.&lt;ref name=sportrelief&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportrelief.com/whats-on/challenges/cycle/meet-the-team/russell-howard|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100214023516/http://www.sportrelief.com/whats-on/challenges/cycle/meet-the-team/russell-howard|archivedate=14 February 2010|title=Russell Howard|publisher=Sport Relief|accessdate=17 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Good News For Russell|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2009/08/29/9516|work=Chortle|date=29 August 2009|access-date=30 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the show, he gave his take on the week's major news stories, as well as giving attention to some of the more light-hearted stories of the week. Two more series of the show were commissioned, with the second series starting on 25 March 2010.&lt;ref name=goodnews23&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2010/02/16/10525/ | title=Russell Howard's very good news |work=Chortle |date=16 February 2010 | accessdate=17 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A seventh series began on 27 September 2012 on BBC Three. Series 8 began on 25 April 2013 on BBC Three, and series 9 started broadcast in its new home on [[BBC Two]] in October 2014.

In November 2013 Howard made a surprise appearance in the North East market town [[Barnard Castle]] to preview his latest tour show, Wonderbox.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/NEWS/10705789.Comedian_Russell_Howard_confirms_intimate_Barnard_Castle_gig/|title=Comedian Russell Howard confirms intimate Barnard Castle gig|website=The Northern Echo|access-date=2017-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2015 to 2016, Howard presented a show called ''[[Chris Ramsey's Stand Up Central|Russell Howard's Stand Up Central]]'' which broadcasts on [[Comedy Central (UK and Ireland)|Comedy Central]]. However, in 2017 due to tour commitments, Howard was unable to present the show's third series and was replaced by [[Chris Ramsey (comedian)|Chris Ramsey]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/news/2573/chris_ramsey_stand_up_central/&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 he appeared on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon]]'' where he performed some stand-up.

In December 2015, Howard made his acting debut in BBC Two's hour-long comedy-drama ''[[A Gert Lush Christmas]]'', which he also co-wrote. In the film, Howard played Dan Colman, who takes his girlfriend to meet his family in Bristol for Christmas. The film also co-starred Howard's sister Kerry, who played Dan's sister Julie. On 10 March 2016, Howard appeared on the BBC 1 panel show ''Room 101''.

In March 2016 Howard attacked Conservative MP [[Philip Davies]] on his BBC show calling him an "arsehole", "windbag", "wanker" and a "toad-faced hypocrite", accusing the MP of filibustering (talking out a bill). Davies complained on the grounds of "inaccuracy" and "misrepresentation" and the BBC was forced to publish in the Clarifications and Corrections section of the BBC website stating "Davies did not personally use up all the time available for the debate and that almost three hours remained after he sat down". Howard was also found to have misrepresented Davies' views on the disabled and the BBC noted "that the programme did not fully represent his comments, which were, that it would be in the best interests of disabled people, and others, to be allowed to offer to work for less than the minimum wage, if the alternative were no employment at all". The broadcaster also agreed not to air the episode again due to their misrepresentation of Davies' position.&lt;ref&gt;http://uk.businessinsider.com/tory-philip-davies-furious-bbc-russell-howard-toad-faced-hypocrite-2016-9.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[BBC Trust]] later rejected a further escalation of the complaint by Davies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sweney|first=Mark|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/sep/29/tory-mp-complaint-russell-howard-bbc-trust-philip-davies|title=Tory MP's complaint about Russell Howard jibes rejected by BBC Trust|work=The Guardian|date=29 September 2016|accessdate=29 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in October 2016, Howard presented a travel documentary series for Comedy Central called ''[[Russell Howard &amp; Mum: USA Road Trip]]'' which involved him and his mother Ninette travelling through America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.comedy.co.uk/videos/11803/russell_howard_mum_us_road_trip/ |title=Russell Howard &amp; Mum: US Road Trip |first=|last=|publisher=British Comedy Guide}}&lt;/ref&gt;
