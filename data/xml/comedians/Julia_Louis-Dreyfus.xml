==Early life==
Louis-Dreyfus was born in [[New York City]]. Her American-born mother, Judith (née LeFever), was a writer and [[special needs education|special needs]] tutor,&lt;ref name="actors"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Julia Louis-Dreyfus|series=[[Inside the Actors Studio]]|first=James (host)|last=Lipton|network=[[Bravo (U.S. TV network)|Bravo]]|date=June 4, 2007|season=13|number=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and her French-born father, [[Gérard Louis-Dreyfus]], chaired Louis Dreyfus Energy Services.

She is a great-great-granddaughter of [[Léopold Louis-Dreyfus]], who in 1851 founded the [[Louis Dreyfus Group]], a French commodities and shipping conglomerate, which members of her family control into the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gerard Louis Dreyfus Executive Biography |publisher=[[Louis Dreyfus Group]] |url=http://www.louisdreyfus.com/content.cfm?page=execbios.cfm&amp;gbus=8 |date=October 28, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025194715/http://www.louisdreyfus.com/content.cfm?page=execbios.cfm&amp;gbus=8 |archivedate=October 25, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her paternal grandfather, [[Pierre Louis-Dreyfus]], was president of the Louis Dreyfus Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Louis Dreyfus Dead at 102 |url=http://www.tradewinds.no/drycargo/article574101.ece |accessdate=June 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pierre was from an [[History of the Jews in Alsace|Alsatian Jewish]] family;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/beb450a27e/judd-apatow-s-all-star-video-part-2|title=Judd Apatow's All-Star Video Part 2|work=Funny Or Die}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Buried by the Times: The Holocaust And America's Most Important Newspaper'', Laurel Leff, Cambridge University Press, March 2005, page 81&lt;/ref&gt; he remained in France during [[World War II]], fighting as a [[cavalry]] officer and later in the [[French Resistance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=TVtropolis |url=http://www.canada.com/tvtropolis/story.html?id=1375fbf0-e748-4bfc-9729-d2b6e065bec7 |title=Julia Louis-Dreyfus&amp;nbsp;— Seinfeld |publisher=Canada.com |date=June 1, 2006 |accessdate=September 1, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090301103839/http://www2.canada.com/tvtropolis/story.html?id=1375fbf0-e748-4bfc-9729-d2b6e065bec7 |archivedate=March 1, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her paternal grandmother was born in America, to parents from Brazil (of German descent) and Mexico; during the 1940s, she moved Julia's father to America from France.&lt;ref name="Gérard Louis-Dreyfus &amp; family"&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/finance/lists/10/2004/LIR.jhtml?passListId=10&amp;passYear=2004&amp;passListType=Person&amp;uniqueId=DDGH&amp;datatype=Person Gérard Louis-Dreyfus &amp; family] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716081805/http://www.forbes.com/finance/lists/10/2004/LIR.jhtml?passListId=10&amp;passYear=2004&amp;passListType=Person&amp;uniqueId=DDGH&amp;datatype=Person |date=July 16, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The History of Foreign Investment in the United States, 1914–1945'', Harvard University Press, 2004, By Mira Wilkins, page 479&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, one year after Louis-Dreyfus's birth, her parents divorced. After relocating to [[Washington, D.C.]], when Julia was eight, her mother married L. Thompson Bowles, Dean of the [[George Washington University School of Medicine|George Washington University Medical School]].&lt;ref name="actors"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.regenerx.com/wt/page/bod_bowles Regenerex.com Board of Directors] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303202133/http://www.regenerx.com/wt/page/bod_bowles |date=March 3, 2016 }} at RegenerX web site&lt;/ref&gt; During her childhood, her mother occasionally took her to [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] church services.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/8977345/ Del Rio News Herald: "Why My Kids Never Watched Seinfeld" by Dotson Rader] August 16, 1998 › Page 50 |''" "And my mother's very funny. There's a lot of funny in my family. There was also a strong sense of what is right and what is wrong. It didn't come from a church. Although my mother took me to a Unitarian church on occasion, my values came from my family."''&lt;/ref&gt;

Louis-Dreyfus spent her childhood in several states and countries, in connection with her stepfather's work with [[Project HOPE (USA)|Project HOPE]], including [[Vietnam]], [[Colombia]], and [[Tunisia]].&lt;ref&gt;Rochlin, Margy.

==Career==
===1982–89: Early work and ''Saturday Night Live''===
[[File:The Golden Jubilee (1982).jpg|thumb|Louis-Dreyfus as a part of The Practical Theatre Company's "Golden 50th Anniversary Jubilee" in 1982, alongside cast mates [[Brad Hall]], [[Gary Kroeger]] and Paul Barrosse]]

As part of her comedic training, Louis-Dreyfus appeared in [[The Second City]], one of Chicago's best-known improvisational theatre groups whose alumni include [[Alan Arkin]], [[Steve Carell]], [[Stephen Colbert]], [[Tina Fey]], [[Amy Poehler]], [[Shelley Long]], [[John Belushi]], [[Dan Aykroyd]], [[Bill Murray]], [[John Candy]], [[Chris Farley]], [[Bob Odenkirk]] and many, many others who went on to become successful comedians and pop culture icons. It was her performance with [[The Practical Theatre Company]] at their "Golden 50th Anniversary Jubilee" that led to her being asked to join the cast of [[NBC]]'s ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' at the age of 21.

Louis-Dreyfus was subsequently made into a cast member on ''Saturday Night Live'' from 1982 to 1985, becoming the youngest female cast member in the history of the program at that time.&lt;ref name="actors"/&gt; During her time on ''SNL'', she appeared alongside several actors who would later rise to prominence, such as [[Eddie Murphy]], [[Jim Belushi]], [[Billy Crystal]], and [[Martin Short]]. It was during her third and final year on ''SNL'' that she met writer [[Larry David]] during his only year on the show,&lt;ref name="Fresh Air"&gt;{{cite web |title=Fresh Air with Terry Gross, May 3, 2012: Interview with Julia Louis-Dreyfus; Interview with Steven Moffat; Review of the film "The Avengers." |date=May 3, 2012 |url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/fresh-air-with-terry-gross-may-3-2012-interview-with-julia-louis-dreyfus-interview-with-steven-moffat-review-of-the-film-the-avengers/oclc/958462148 |website=Fresh Air with Terry Gross

Following her 1985 departure from ''SNL'', Louis-Dreyfus appeared in several films, including the [[Woody Allen]]-directed ''[[Hannah and Her Sisters]]'' (1986); ''[[Soul Man (film)|Soul Man]]'' (1986), starring [[C. Thomas Howell]]; and ''[[National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation]]'' (1989), in which she starred alongside fellow ''SNL'' alum [[Chevy Chase]]. In 1987, Louis-Dreyfus appeared in the NBC sitcom pilot ''The Art of Being Nick'', an intended spin-off from ''[[Family Ties]]'' starring [[Scott Valentine (actor)|Scott Valentine]]. When the pilot did not make it to series, Louis-Dreyfus was retained by producer [[Gary David Goldberg]] for a role on his new sitcom ''[[Day by Day (TV series)|Day by Day]]'', as the sarcastic and materialistic neighbor, Eileen Swift. Premiering in early 1988, ''Day by Day'' aired for two seasons on NBC before being cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aoltv.com/2008/05/08/short-lived-shows-day-by-day-video/ "Short-Lived Shows: Day By Day – VIDEO"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016155552/http://www.aoltv.com/2008/05/08/short-lived-shows-day-by-day-video/ |date=October 16, 2015 }} May 8, 2008, AOL TV&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990–98: The ''Seinfeld'' years===
[[File:Julia Louis-Dreyfus (2078586922).jpg|thumb|upright|left|Louis-Dreyfus at the [[47th Primetime Emmy Awards|47th Emmy Awards ceremony]] in September 1995]]
In the early 1990s, Louis-Dreyfus became famous for the role of [[Elaine Benes]] on NBC's ''[[Seinfeld]]''. She played the role for nine seasons, appearing in all but three episodes.&lt;ref name="actors"/&gt; One of the episodes that she did not appear in was the inaugural pilot episode, "[[The Seinfeld Chronicles]]", because her character was not initially intended to be a part of the series. It was only after the first episode that [[NBC]] executives felt the show was too male-centric, and demanded that creators [[Jerry Seinfeld]] and [[Larry David]] add a woman to the cast. It was revealed in the commentary on the DVD package that the addition of a female character was the condition for commissioning the show. Louis-Dreyfus won the role over several other actresses who would also eventually enjoy their own TV success, including [[Patricia Heaton]], [[Rosie O'Donnell]] and [[Megan Mullally]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://au.askmen.com/entertainment/special_feature_150/164_special_feature.html "5 Things You Didn't Know: Seinfeld"] Askmen.com&lt;/ref&gt;

On the "Notes About Nothing" featurette on the [[DVD]] package, Seinfeld says that Louis-Dreyfus' ability to eat a peanut [[M&amp;M's|M&amp;M]] without breaking the peanut aptly describes the actress: "She cracks you up without breaking your nuts."

Her performance on the series was met with critical acclaim, and she was a regular winner and nominee at television award shows throughout the 1990s. Her performance earned her two [[Golden Globe Award]] nominations, winning once in 1994, nine [[Screen Actors Guild Award]] nominations, winning one in 1995 and two in both 1997 and 1998, and seven [[American Comedy Awards]], winning five times in 1993, 1994, 1995, 1997 and 1998. In 1996, she received the [[Primetime Emmy Award]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/julia-louis-dreyfus Julia Louis-Dreyfus Emmy Nominated]. Emmys.com.&lt;/ref&gt; for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series, an award she was nominated for on seven occasions from 1992 to 1998. After receiving the award, Louis-Dreyfus claimed the win was a "shocker", and that after being in both positions, it was "much better to win than to lose."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.people.com/people/julia_louis-dreyfus/biography Bio] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304061010/http://www.people.com/people/julia_louis-dreyfus/biography |date=March 4, 2016 }} Celebrity Central/Top 25 Celebs, ''People''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, Seinfeld decided to end the series after nine seasons. The [[The Finale (Seinfeld)|series finale]] aired on May 14 and was one of the most watched TV events in history, with over 76 million people tuning in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/16/arts/rating-for-seinfeld-finale-grazed-super-bowl-country.html | work=The New York Times | first=Bill | last=Carter | title=Rating for 'Seinfeld' Finale Grazed Super Bowl Country | date=May 16, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During her time on ''Seinfeld'' she appeared in several films, including ''[[Fathers' Day (1997 film)|Fathers' Day]]'', opposite [[Robin Williams]] and [[Billy Crystal]], and [[Woody Allen]]'s Oscar-nominated ''[[Deconstructing Harry]]''.

===1999–2004: After ''Seinfeld''===
Following a voice role in the successful [[Disney]] [[Pixar]]'s ''[[A Bug's Life]]'', Louis-Dreyfus lent her voice as [[Snake (The Simpsons)|Snake]]'s girlfriend Gloria in ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[A Hunka Hunka Burns in Love]]". In 2001, she made several special guest appearances on ''Seinfeld'' co-creator [[Larry David]]'s show ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'', playing herself fictionally trying to break the "curse" by planning to star in a show in which she would play an actress affected by a ''Seinfeld''-like curse.

After several years away from a regular TV job, Louis-Dreyfus began a new single-camera sitcom, ''[[Watching Ellie]]'', which premiered on NBC in February 2002. The series was created by husband [[Brad Hall]], and co-starred [[Steve Carell]] and Louis-Dreyfus' half-sister [[Lauren Bowles]]. The initial premise of the show was to present viewers with a "slice of life" from the goings-on and happenings of the life of Ellie Riggs, a Southern California jazz singer. The first season included a 22-minute countdown kept digitally in the lower left-hand corner of the screen, which many critics panned, claiming it was useless and "did nothing for the show."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117917072 | work=Variety | first=Phil | last=Gallo | title=Watching Ellie | date=February 23, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, the show received mixed reviews, but debuted strongly with over 16 million viewers tuning in for the series premiere, and maintained an average audience of about 10 million viewers per week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/2002/2002-05-28-year-end-chart.htm|title=How did your favorite show rate?|work=[[USA Today]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the series returned for a second season in the spring of 2003, it suffered a decline in viewership, averaging around eight million viewers per week. The show had undergone a drastic stylistic change between production of seasons one and two. The first season was filmed in the single-camera format, but the second season was presented as a traditional multicamera sitcom filmed in front of a live studio audience.&lt;ref name=op&gt;[http://old.post-gazette.com/tv/20030414owen0414fnp4.asp "TV Review: NBC's retooled 'Ellie' vastly more watchable"] April 14, 2003, ''Post Gazette''&lt;/ref&gt; With dwindling viewership and failing to retain the numbers from its ''[[Frasier]]'' lead-in, the series was cancelled by NBC in May 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.seattlepi.com/ae/tv/article/NBC-s-fall-lineup-is-looking-a-lot-like-its-1114511.php | work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer | first1=Melanie | last1=Mcfarland | title=NBC's fall lineup is looking a lot like its current one | date=November 5, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following NBC's cancellation of ''Watching Ellie'', the media began circulating rumors of a so-called "[[Seinfeld curse]]", which claimed that none of the former ''Seinfeld'' actors could ever achieve success again in the television industry.

===Health===
On September 28, 2017, Louis-Dreyfus announced on [[Twitter]] her diagnosis of [[breast cancer]] – a diagnosis she received one day after receiving a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series]] for her role in ''Veep''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Arnowitz|first1=Leora|title=Julia Louis-Dreyfus reveals she has breast cancer|url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/09/28/julia-louis-dreyfus-reveals-has-breast-cancer.html|website=foxnews.com|publisher=Fox News|accessdate=September 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her announcement on Twitter, she stated: "One in 8 women get breast cancer. Today, I'm the one. The good news is that I have the most glorious group of supportive and caring family and friends, and fantastic insurance through my union. The bad news is that not all women are so lucky, so let's fight all cancers and make universal healthcare a reality."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2017/09/28/entertainment/julia-louis-dreyfus-cancer/index.html|title=Julia Louis-Dreyfus has breast cancer|last=CNN|first=Lisa Respers France|publisher=CNN|access-date=September 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
