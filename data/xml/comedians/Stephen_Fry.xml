==Early life and education==

Fry was born in [[Hampstead]], [[London]] on 24 August 1957&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/ww/9780199540884.013.16544|title=Fry, Stephen John, (born 24 Aug. 1957), writer, actor, comedian|journal=[[Who's Who(UK)|Who's Who]]|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; to Marianne Eve Fry (née Newman) and Alan John Fry, a British physicist and inventor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/71/Stephen-Fry.html|title=Stephen Fry profile|publisher=Filmreference.com|accessdate=4 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/comedy/all-or-nothingness-20100625-z9dy.html|title=All or nothing for Stephen Fry|first=Stephanie|last=Bunbury|date=26 June 2010|work=Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="whothink"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/familyhistory/get_started/wdytya_s2_celeb_gallery_03.shtml|title="Who Do You Think You Are?", Series Two: Celebrity Gallery}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fry's father is English, and his paternal grandmother had roots in [[Kent]] and [[Cheshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/stephen-fry-discovers-that-he-too-is-just-another-ruddy-peasant-1.30906|title=Stephen Fry discovers that he too is 'just another ruddy peasant'|date=26 January 2006|work=Herald Scotland}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whodoyouthinkyouaremagazine.com/episode/stephen-fry|title=Stephen Fry|first=Matt|last=Elton|date=29 June 2009|work=Who Do You Think You Are? Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fry family originates in [[Dorset]], at [[Shillingstone]] and [[Blandford]]; in the early 1800s, Samuel Fry (second son of James Fry, of Shillingstone and Blandford) settled in Surrey, with his descendants residing in Middlesex.&lt;ref&gt;Visitation of England and Wales vol. 20, 1919, ed. Frederick Arthur Crisp, pp 41–44, 'Fry of Finchley, co. Middlesex' pedigree&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Stephen Fry at Norcat (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|Fry at rehearsals for student production of ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' at [[Norfolk College of Arts and Technology]], 1975]]
Fry's mother is [[British Jews|Jewish]], but he was not brought up in a religious family.&lt;ref name=guard5&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/jun/05/religion.hayfestival2005|title=I saw hate in a graveyard – Stephen Fry|first=David|last=Smith|work=The Observer|date=5 June 2005|accessdate=7 June 2013|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; His maternal grandparents, Martin and Rosa Neumann,&lt;ref name=whothink/&gt; were [[History of the Jews in Hungary|Hungarian Jews]], who emigrated from [[Šurany]] (now Slovakia) to Britain in 1927. Rosa Neumann's parents, who originally lived in [[Vienna]], were sent to a concentration camp in [[Riga, Latvia]], where they were murdered by the [[Nazi]]s.&lt;ref name=whothink/&gt;&lt;ref name=guard5/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Hamilton|first=Alan|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article507549.ece|title=Candles light heart of darkness|newspaper=The Times|accessdate=4 February 2009|location=London|date=28 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother's aunt and cousins were sent to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] and [[Stutthof concentration camp|Stutthof]] and never seen again.&lt;ref name=whothink/&gt;

Fry grew up in the village of [[Booton, Norfolk|Booton]] near [[Reepham, Norfolk]], having moved from [[Chesham]], Buckinghamshire, at an early age. He has an elder brother, Roger, and a younger sister, Joanna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2009/jun/04/stephen-fry-hugh-laurie-television|title=A bout of Fry v Laurie|first=Stuart|last=Jeffries|date=4 June 2009|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fry briefly attended Cawston Primary School in [[Cawston, Norfolk]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cawstonparish.info/Web%20Sites%20&amp;%20Books%20About%20Cawston.htm|title=Cawston Parish in Norfolk|publisher=Cawstonparish.info|accessdate=4 February 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725062633/http://www.cawstonparish.info/Web%20Sites%20%26%20Books%20About%20Cawston.htm|archivedate=25 July 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; before going on to [[Stouts Hill]] Preparatory School in [[Uley]], Gloucestershire, at the age of seven, and then to [[Uppingham School]], [[Rutland]], where he joined Fircroft house, and was described as a "near-asthmatic genius".&lt;ref&gt;''Fry and Laurie Reunited'', 2010 ([[Gold (UK TV channel)|Gold]])&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--He never attended Gresham's School in Holt. He has said this himself in his book 'Stephen Fry in America', as well as even coming to this article himself to remove that information. --&gt; He was expelled from Uppingham when he was 15 and subsequently from [[Paston College#Paston School|the Paston School]].

At 17, after leaving [[College of West Anglia|Norfolk College of Arts and Technology]], Fry absconded with a credit card stolen from a family friend.&lt;ref name="Moab"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fry|first=Stephen|title=Moab Is My Washpot&amp;nbsp;– An Autobiography|publisher=[[Hutchinson (publisher)|Hutchinson]]|location=London|year=1997|pages=305–335|isbn=0-09-180161-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had taken a coat when leaving a pub, planning to spend the night sleeping rough, but had then discovered the card in a pocket.&lt;ref name=Grylls/&gt; He was arrested in [[Swindon]], and, as a result, spent three months in [[HM Prison Ashfield|Pucklechurch Prison]] on [[Remand (detention)|remand]]. While Fry was in Pucklechurch, his mother had cut out the crossword from every copy of ''[[The Times]]'' since he had been away, something which Fry said was "a wonderful act of kindness". Fry later stated that these crosswords were the only thing that got him through the ordeal.&lt;ref name="Moab"/&gt;

Following his release, he resumed his education at [[City College Norwich]], promising administrators that he would study rigorously to sit the [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] entrance exams. He scored well enough to gain a scholarship to [[Queens' College, Cambridge]]. At Cambridge, Fry joined the [[Footlights]], appeared on ''[[University Challenge]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ukgameshows.com/ukgs/University_Challenge |title=University Challenge page at UK Game Shows}}&lt;/ref&gt; and read for a degree in [[English literature]], graduating with [[upper second-class honours]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://humanism.org.uk/about/our-people/distinguished-supporters/stephen-fry/|title=Stephen Fry.

====Comedy====
[[File:Stephen Fry Book Signing.jpg|thumb|upright|Fry signing autographs at the [[Apple Store]], [[Regent Street]], London, on 3 February 2009]]
Fry's career in television began with the 1982 broadcasting of ''[[The Cellar Tapes]]'', the 1981 Cambridge Footlights Revue which was written by Fry, [[Hugh Laurie]], [[Emma Thompson]] and [[Tony Slattery]]. The revue caught the attention of [[Granada Television]], who, keen to replicate the success of the BBC's ''[[Not the Nine O'Clock News]]'', hired Fry, Laurie and Thompson to star alongside [[Ben Elton]] in ''[[There's Nothing to Worry About!]]''. A second series, retitled ''[[Alfresco (TV series)|Alfresco]]'', was broadcast in 1983, and a third in 1984; it established Fry and Laurie's reputation as a comedy double act. In 1983, the BBC offered Fry, Laurie and Thompson their own show, which became ''[[The Crystal Cube]]'', a mixture of science fiction and [[mockumentary]] that was cancelled after the first episode. Undeterred, Fry and Laurie appeared in an episode of ''[[The Young Ones (TV series)|The Young Ones]]'' in 1984, and Fry also appeared in Ben Elton's 1985 ''[[Happy Families (1985 TV series)|Happy Families]]'' series. In 1986 and 1987 Fry and Laurie performed sketches on the LWT/Channel 4 show ''[[Saturday Live (UK TV series)|Saturday Live]]''.

Forgiving Fry and Laurie for ''The Crystal Cube'', the BBC commissioned, in 1986, a sketch show that was to become ''[[A Bit of Fry &amp; Laurie]]''. The programme ran for 26 episodes spanning four series between 1986 and 1995, and was very successful. During this time, Fry starred in ''[[Blackadder II]]'' as Lord Melchett, made a guest appearance in ''[[Blackadder#Series 3: Blackadder the Third|Blackadder the Third]]'' as [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|the Duke of Wellington]], then returned to a starring role in ''[[Blackadder Goes Forth]]'', as General Melchett. In a 1988 television special, ''[[Blackadder's Christmas Carol]]'', he played the roles of Lord Melchett and Lord Frondo. Between 1990 and 1993, Fry starred as [[Jeeves]] (alongside Hugh Laurie's [[Bertie Wooster]]) in ''[[Jeeves and Wooster]]'', 23 hour-long adaptations of [[P. G. Wodehouse]]'s novels and short stories.

Towards the end of 2003, Fry starred alongside [[John Bird (actor)|John Bird]] in the television adaptation of ''[[Absolute Power (comedy)|Absolute Power]]'', previously a radio series on BBC Radio 4. In 2010, Fry took part in a Christmas series of short films called ''Little Crackers''. His short was based on a story from his childhood at school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sky1.sky.com/Little-Crackers-Stephen-Fry-About|title=Stephen Fry – Little Crackers|publisher=Sky1.sky.com|accessdate=22 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He appeared as the Christian God in 2011's ''[[Holy Flying Circus]]''. In January 2016 it was announced that Fry would be appearing as the character "Cuddly Dick" in Series 3 of the ''[[Sky One]]'' family comedy ''[[Yonderland]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2016-01-25/stephen-fry-joins-cast-of-sky-comedy-yonderland-as-cuddly-dick | title=Stephen Fry joins cast of Sky comedy Yonderland… as Cuddly Dick | work=[[Radio Times]] | date=25 January 2016 | accessdate=25 January 2016 | author=Dowell, Ben}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Fry had a lead role in the American sitcom ''[[The Great Indoors (TV series)|The Great Indoors]]''. He portrayed an outdoor magazine publisher helping to ease his best worldly reporter ([[Joel McHale]]) into a desk job.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2016/03/stephen-fry-cast-the-great0indoors-cbs-comedy-pilot-1201720843/|title=Stephen Fry To Co-Star In CBS Comedy Pilot ‘The Great Indoors’|first=Nellie|last=Andreeva|date=15 March 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show was cancelled after one season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/the-great-indoors-canceled-cbs-1202425547/|title=‘The Great Indoors’ Canceled After One Season at CBS|first=Joe|last=Otterson|date=13 May 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Drama====
Fry has appeared in a number of BBC adaptations of plays and books, including a 1992 adaptation of the Simon Gray play ''[[The Common Pursuit]]'' (he had previously appeared in the West End stage production); a 1998 [[Malcolm Bradbury]] adaptation of the [[Mark Tavener]] novel ''[[In the Red (novel)|In the Red]]'', taking the part of the Controller of [[BBC Radio 2]]; and in 2000 in the role of Professor Bellgrove in the BBC serial ''[[Gormenghast (TV serial)|Gormenghast]]'', which was adapted from the first two novels of [[Mervyn Peake]]'s ''[[Gormenghast (series)|Gormenghast]]'' series. In 2011, Fry portrayed Professor Mildeye in the BBC adaptation of Mary Norton's 1952 novel ''[[The Borrowers]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Stephen Fry and Victoria Wood to star in The Borrowers |last= Frost|first= Vicky |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/jun/18/the-borrowers-christmas-bbc |newspaper=The Guardian |date=17 June 2011 |accessdate=26 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film===
Having made his film début in the 1985 film ''[[The Good Father]]'', Fry had a brief appearance in ''[[A Fish Called Wanda]]'' (in which he is knocked out by [[Kevin Kline]], who is posing as an airport security man), and then appeared as the eponymous Peter in [[Kenneth Branagh]]'s ''[[Peter's Friends]]'' in 1992. In the 1994 romantic comedy film [[I.Q. (film)|''I.Q.'']], he played the role of James Moreland. Portraying [[Oscar Wilde]] (of whom he had been an ardent admirer since the age of 13) in the 1997 film ''[[Wilde (film)|Wilde]]'', he fulfilled to critical acclaim a role that he has said he was "born to play". It also earned him a nomination for Best Actor – Drama in the [[56th Golden Globe Awards#Best Actor – Drama|1998 Golden Globe Award]]. A year later, Fry starred in [[David Yates]]' small independent film ''[[The Tichborne Claimant (film)|The Tichborne Claimant]]'', and in 2001 he played the detective in [[Robert Altman]]'s period costume drama, ''[[Gosford Park]]''.

Fry's distinctive voice has been featured in a number of video games, including an appearance as Reaver, an amoral supporting character in [[Lionhead Studios]] games ''[[Fable II]]'' and ''[[Fable III]]'', and as the narrator of the ''[[LittleBigPlanet]]'' series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.us.playstation.com/2010/05/10/littlebigplanet-2-for-ps3-officially-announced-for-winter-2010/#comment-401630|title=LittleBigPlanet 2 for PS3 Officially Announced for Winter 2010! – PlayStation Blog|publisher=Blog.us.playstation.com|date=10 May 2010|accessdate=14 June 2010}} He is also voiced in [[PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale]], a crossover fighting game, as the same character in LittleBigPlanet for Sackboy's story in the game.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3173855|title=Stephen Fry Lending British Charm to Little Big Planet PSP: News from 1UP.com|publisher=1UP.com|date=21 April 2009|accessdate=21 April 2008}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also narrated the first four ''[[Harry Potter]]'' games: ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game)|Philosopher's Stone]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (video game)|Chamber of Secrets]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game)|Prisoner of Azkaban]]'', and ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (video game)|Goblet of Fire]]''.

===Advertising===
Fry has appeared in numerous advertisements – either on-screen or in voice-over – starting with an appearance as "Count Ivan Skavinsky Skavar" in a 1982 advert for [[Whitbread]] [[bitter (beer)|Best Bitter]]. Fry has said, in his memoirs, that after receiving his payment for this work – £25,000 – he has never subsequently experienced "what one could call serious money troubles".{{sfn|Fry|2010|pp=234–237}} He has since appeared in adverts for products and companies such as [[Marks and Spencer]], [[Twinings]], [[Kenco]], [[Vauxhall]], [[Honda]], [[Direct Line]], [[Calpol]], [[Heineken]], [[Alliance &amp; Leicester]] (a series of adverts which also featured Hugh Laurie), [[After Eights]], [[List of Cadbury products#Trebor|Trebor]], Panama cigars, [[Virgin Media]] and [[Orange Mobile]].

===Literature===
Since the publication of his first novel, ''[[The Liar (novel)|The Liar]]'' ([[#CITEREFFry1991|1991]]), Fry has written three further novels, several non-fiction works and three volumes of autobiography. ''[[Making History (novel)|Making History]]'' ([[#CITEREFFry1996|1996]]) is partly set in an alternative universe in which [[Adolf Hitler]]'s father is made infertile and his replacement proves a rather more effective Führer. The book won the [[Sidewise Award for Alternate History]]. ''[[The Hippopotamus]]'' ([[#CITEREFFry1994|1994]]) is about Edward (Ted/Tedward) Wallace and his stay at his old friend Lord Logan's country manor in Norfolk. ''[[The Hippopotamus (film)|The Hippopotamus]]'' was later adapted into a 2017 film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/hippopotamus-962931|title=‘The Hippopotamus’: Film Review - Palm Springs 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Stars' Tennis Balls]]'' ([[#CITEREFFry2000b|2000]]) is a modern retelling of ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo]]''. Fry's book ''[[The Ode Less Travelled: Unlocking the Poet Within]]'' is a guide to writing poetry.

When writing a book review for ''[[Tatler (1901)|Tatler]]'', Fry wrote under a pen name, Williver Hendry, editor of ''A Most Peculiar Friendship: The Correspondence of Lord Alfred Douglas and Jack Dempsey'', a field close to his heart as an Oscar Wilde enthusiast. Once a columnist in ''[[The Listener (magazine)|The Listener]]'' and ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', he now writes a weekly technology column in the Saturday edition of ''[[The Guardian]]''. His blog attracted more than 300,000 visitors in its first two weeks.&lt;ref name="Stephen Fry I Give Up" /&gt;

In May 2009, Fry unveiled ''[[The Dongle of Donald Trefusis]]'', an audiobook series following Donald Trefusis (a fictional character from Fry's novel ''The Liar'' and from the BBC Radio 4 series ''[[Loose Ends (radio)|Loose Ends]]''), set over 12 episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stephenfry.com/dongle/|title=The New Adventures of Mr Stephen Fry – The Dongle of Donald Trefusis – Episode 3 now available|publisher=Stephenfry.com|accessdate=25 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; After its release, it reached No. 1 on the [[UK Album Chart]] list. Ultimately however only three episodes were released, the rest with the note 'exact release date pending'. Fry's use of the word "[[wikt:luvvy|luvvie]]" (spelled "lovie" by Fry), in ''The Guardian'' on 2 April 1988, is given by the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' as the earliest recorded use of the word as a humorous synonym for "actor".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/00298007 |title=Luvvie, n |work=Oxford English Dictionary |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=1 March 2008 |accessdate=25 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629021537/http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/00298007 |archivedate=29 June 2011 }} (requires subscription)&lt;/ref&gt;

Fry was, at one time, slated to adapt ''[[A Confederacy of Dunces]]'' by John Kennedy Toole for the big screen.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} On December 1, 2015, Baidarka Boy, an imprint of Brooklyn Bridge University Press, released ''A Cornucopia of Dunderheads'', a parody of Toole's ''Dunces.''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Cornucopia-Dunderheads-CONFEDERACY-Foreword-Franz-Heinrich/dp/0692572376/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1530743308&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=a+cornucopia+of+dunderheads&lt;/ref&gt; The purported author of this parody is John Kennedy Toole Jr., who claims to be Toole's illegitimate son.

===Football===
In August 2010, Fry joined the board of directors at [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City Football Club]]. A lifelong fan of "the Canaries" and a regular visitor to [[Carrow Road]], he said, on being appointed, "Truly this is one of the most exciting days of my life, and I am as proud and pleased as I could be."&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-norfolk-10968940|work=BBC News|title=Stephen Fry joins Norwich City board|date=13 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fry stepped down from his Board position in January 2016, to take up a new position as "Norwich City Ambassador".&lt;ref name="resi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edp24.co.uk/sport/norwich-city/stephen_fry_steps_down_from_norwich_city_board_as_delia_s_nephew_joins_1_4384262|title=Stephen Fry steps down from Norwich City board as Delia’s nephew joins|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fry said, "My five years in the role have been an honour and a privilege beyond almost anything I can remember. I wish I could take credit for ushering the club up from League One to the Premiership during that time on the Board. Actually, I’m going to. It was all me. It can’t have been a coincidence ... But now I’m so happy to relinquish my seat on the board to Thomas Smith and to engage as fully as I can in the role of ambassador for Norwich City. We have so much to be proud of, both on and off the pitch, and I hope to welcome many new fans to the greatest club of all. On the Ball, City!"&lt;ref name="resi"/&gt; In February 2014, Fry became the honorary president of [[Proud Canaries]], a new club for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Proud Canaries LGBT group supported by Stephen Fry|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-norfolk-26316210|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|accessdate=23 February 2014|date=23 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|There has been a history, let's face it, in Poland of a right-wing Catholicism which has been deeply disturbing for those of us who know a little history, and remember which side of the border [[Auschwitz]] was on and know the stories, and know much of the [[anti-semitism|anti-semitic]], and [[homophobia|homophobic]] and [[nationalism|nationalistic]] elements in countries like Poland.}}
The remark prompted a complaint from the [[Polish Embassy in London]], an editorial in ''[[The Economist]]'' and criticism from British Jewish historian [[David Cesarani]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/world/europe/displayStory.cfm?story_id=14635055|title=Europe.view: Unoccupied Britain|work=[[The Economist]]|accessdate=17 October 2009|date=15 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=David |last=Ceserani|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/oct/12/stephen-fry-auschwitz-poland|title=Stephen Fry's Auschwitz blunder|work=The Guardian |date=13 October 2009|accessdate=17 October 2009| location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Day|first= Matthew|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/poland/6274395/Stephen-Fry-provokes-Polish-fury-over-Auschwitz-remark.html|title=Stephen Fry provokes Polish fury over Auschwitz remark|publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]]|accessdate=9 October 2009| location=London| date=8 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/politics/domestic_politics/complaints+fry+aposslanderedapos+poland+over+auschwitz/3377697|title=Complaints: Fry 'slandered' Poland over Auschwitz|publisher=[[Channel 4]]|accessdate=9 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fry has since posted an apology in a six-page post on his personal blog, in which he stated:{{Quote|I offer no excuse. I seemed to imply that the Polish people had been responsible for the most infamous of all the death factories of the [[Third Reich]]. I didn't even really at the time notice the import of what I had said, so gave myself no opportunity instantly to retract the statement. It was a rubbishy, cheap and offensive remark that I have been regretting ever since. I take this opportunity to apologise now. I said a stupid, thoughtless and fatuous thing. It detracted from and devalued my argument, such as it was, and it outraged and offended a large group of people for no very good reason. I am sorry in all directions, and all the more sorry because it is no one's fault but my own, which always makes it so much worse.&lt;ref name="stephenfry.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stephenfry.com/2009/10/19/poles-politeness-and-politics-in-the-age-of-twitter/|title=Poles, Politeness and Politics in the age of Twitter|accessdate=19 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Health===
Fry has [[bipolar disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/stephen-fry-my-battle-with-mental-illness-416386.html "Stephen Fry: My battle with mental illness" The Independent 17 September 2006] Retrieved 23 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt; His first diagnosis was [[cyclothymia]], which he refers to as "bipolar lite".&lt;ref name="latenightlive"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZb5YbtvYhw|title=Craig Ferguson 2/23/10B Late Late show Stephen Fry PT1|publisher=[[The Late Late Show (Ireland)|The Late Late Show]] via Youtube|date=23 February 2010|accessdate=14 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="twitterpost"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/stephenfry/status/1332661172|title=Cyclothymic upswings are dangerously expensive.

He is involved with the mental health charity [[Stand to Reason (charity)|Stand to Reason]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reception with Stephen Fry |url=http://www.standtoreason.org.uk/news?id=23 |publisher=Standtoreason.org |accessdate=7 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110207005725/http://www.standtoreason.org.uk/news?id=23 |archivedate=7 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is president of [[Mind (charity)|Mind]].&lt;ref name="mind" /&gt; In 2013, he revealed that, in the previous year, he had started taking medication for the first time, in an attempt to control his condition.&lt;ref name="Grylls" /&gt; In 2018, alongside [[Nadiya Hussain]] and [[Olly Alexander]], Fry was part of [[Sport Relief]]'s attempt to raise awareness of mental health. &lt;ref name="fryreliefnads"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2018/03/24/nadiya-hussain-stephen-fry-reveal-mental-health-battles-moving-sport-relief-film-7412661/|title=Nadiya Hussain and Stephen Fry reveal their mental health battles in moving Sport Relief film|publisher=Metro|date=24 March 2018|accessdate=24 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, while appearing in the West End ''[[Cell Mates (play)|Cell Mates]]'', Fry suffered an [[mental breakdown|acute episode of mental illness]] and walked out of the production, causing its early closure and incurring the displeasure of co-star [[Rik Mayall]] and playwright [[Simon Gray]].&lt;ref name=life&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06tgzp3 |title=BBC Two – A Life on Screen |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=4 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fry went missing for several days and contemplated suicide. He later said that he would have killed himself if he had not had "the option of disappearing".&lt;ref name=life/&gt; He abandoned the idea and left the United Kingdom by ferry, eventually resurfacing in Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/5202066.stm|title=Comedian Fry reveals suicide bid|publisher=BBC News|date=21 July 2006|accessdate=4 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fry has attempted suicide on a number of occasions, most recently in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/jun/05/stephen-fry-attempted-suicide-bipolar|title=Stephen Fry: recent attempted suicide a 'close-run thing'|author=David Batty|work=The Guardian|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with [[Richard Herring]] in 2013, Fry revealed that he had attempted suicide the previous year while filming abroad. He said that he took a "huge number of pills and a huge [amount] of vodka" and had to be brought back to the UK to be "looked after".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-22782913|title=Stephen Fry reveals he attempted suicide in 2012|work=BBC News|accessdate=6 June 2013|date=6 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2008 Fry broke his arm while filming ''[[Last Chance to See (TV series)|Last Chance to See]]'' in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7196783.stm|title=Fry breaks arm filming in Brazil|publisher=BBC|date=18 January 2008|accessdate=18 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; While climbing aboard a boat, he slipped between it and the dock, and, stopping himself from falling into the water, his body weight snapped his right [[humerus]]. The resulting vulnerability to his [[radial nerve]]&amp;nbsp;– which affects use of the arm&amp;nbsp;– was not diagnosed until he saw a consultant in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stephenfry.com/podcasts/|title=Stephen Fry's Podgrams: Episode 1, Broken Arm|publisher=Stephenfry.com|accessdate=4 February 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080822173101/http://stephenfry.com/podcasts/|archivedate=22 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Appearing on the BBC's ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]'' in 2009, Fry had lost a significant amount of weight, and explained that he had shed a total of {{convert|6|st|lb kg}}, attributing the weight loss to doing a lot of walking while listening to downloaded [[audiobook]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.topgear.com/uk/videos/stephen-fry-in-our-reasonably-priced-car|title=Stephen Fry is a Star in a Reasonably Priced Car, part 1/2 (Series 13, Episode 2)|author=Top Gear|work=BBC Top Gear}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fry is between {{convert|6|ft|4|in|m}} and {{convert|6|ft|5|in|m}} in height.&lt;ref&gt;QI Season 7, Episode 10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;QI Season 4 ep. 11 of 13&lt;/ref&gt; Fry has stated that he is allergic to champagne&lt;ref&gt;QI Series C/3, Episode 10&lt;/ref&gt; and [[bumble bee]] stings.&lt;ref&gt;QI Series C/3, Episode 7&lt;/ref&gt; Fry has [[prosopagnosia]], or face blindness.&lt;ref name="Seighart"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sieghart|first1=Mary Ann|title=Who Are You Again?|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07hj65h|website=[[BBC Radio 4]]|date=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hepworth"&gt;{{ cite news |title=Who are you again?

In February 2018, Fry announced via a video that he had had an operation to treat [[prostate cancer]], involving the [[prostatectomy|removal of that organ]] and 11 adjacent lymph nodes, and he was recovering from the surgery. He described the cancer as aggressive and said that early intervention had saved his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Khomani|first=Nadia|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/feb/23/stephen-fry-has-prostate-cancer|title=Stephen Fry has prostate cancer|work=The Guardian|date=23 February 2018|accessdate=23 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCNEWS23"&gt;{{cite news|title=Stephen Fry recovering from prostate cancer surgery|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-43171297|date=23 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views on religion===
Fry has repeatedly expressed opposition to [[organised religion]], and has identified himself as an [[atheism|atheist]] and [[humanism|humanist]], while declaring some sympathy for the [[List of Greek gods|ancient Greek belief in capricious gods]]. In his first autobiography he described how he once considered ordination to the Anglican priesthood, but came to the conclusion that he "couldn't believe in God, because [he] was fundamentally [[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenic]] in [his] outlook."&lt;ref name="Fry"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fry|first=Stephen|title=Moab is my washpot|publisher=Arrow books|year=2004 |origyear=1997|page=382|isbn=978-0-09-945704-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has stated that religion can have positive effects: "Sometimes belief means credulity, sometimes an expression of faith and hope which even the most sceptical atheist such as myself cannot but find inspiring."&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Fry, ''Spectator'' Lecture at the Royal Geographical Society, reprinted as "Would I live in America? In a heartbeat", ''The Spectator'', 9 May 2009, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, ''[[The Guardian]]'' published a letter from Fry addressing his younger self, explaining how his future is soon to unfold, reflecting on the positive progression towards [[homosexuality|gay]] acceptance and openness around him, and yet not everywhere, while warning on how "the cruel, hypocritical and loveless hand of religion and [[Moral absolutism|absolutism]] has fallen on the world once more."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Stephen |last=Fry|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/apr/30/stephen-fry-letter-gay-rights|title='The Guardian': Stephen Fry's letter to himself: Dearest absurd child|work=The Guardian |accessdate=10 May 2009|location=London|date=30 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, he and [[Christopher Hitchens]] participated in an "[[Intelligence Squared]]" debate in which they argued against [[Ann Widdecombe]] and Archbishop [[John Onaiyekan]], who supported the view that the Catholic Church was a force for good. Fry and Hitchens argued that the church did more harm than good. Fry attacked the Catholic Church's teachings on sexuality and denounced its wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://archive.catholicherald.co.uk/article/23rd-october-2009/1/atheist-duo-convince-crowd-that-the-church-is-not-|title=Atheist duo convince crowd that the Church is not a force for good|first=Ed |last=West|work=The Catholic Herald|accessdate=18 February 2012|location=London|date=23 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Fry was made a Distinguished Supporter of the [[British Humanist Association]], stating: "it is essential to nail one's colours to the mast as a humanist."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stephen Fry: "it is essential to nail one's colours to the mast as a humanist".|publisher=British Humanist Association|url=https://humanism.org.uk/2010/02/04/news-447/|date=10 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, Fry joined 54 other public figures in signing an open letter published in ''[[The Guardian]]'' stating their opposition to [[Pope Benedict XVI's visit to the United Kingdom]] being a state visit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/15/harsh-judgments-on-pope-religion|title=Letters: Harsh judgments on the pope and religion|work=The Guardian|accessdate=16 September 2010|location=London|date=15 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 February 2011, Fry was presented with the [[Lifetime Achievement Award in Cultural Humanism]] by the Humanist Chaplaincy at [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://harvardhumanist.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=148:hch-presents-stephen-fry&amp;catid=6:latest-news&amp;Itemid=38 |title=Letters: HCH Presents Stephen Fry |work=Humanist Chaplaincy at Harvard |accessdate=27 January 2011 |location=Cambridge, MA |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110226101954/http://harvardhumanist.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=148%3Ahch-presents-stephen-fry&amp;catid=6%3Alatest-news&amp;Itemid=38 |archivedate=26 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theageofblasphemy.wordpress.com/2011/01/24/395/|title=Stepehn (sic) Fry Wins Outstanding Lifetime Achievement Award in Cultural Humanism|work=The Age of Blasphemy blog|date=24 January 2011|accessdate=15 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When interviewed in 2015 by veteran Irish broadcaster [[Gay Byrne]], Fry was asked what he would say if he came face-to-face with God. Fry said: "Bone cancer in children, what's that about? How dare you? How dare you create a world where there is such misery that's not our fault? It's utterly, utterly evil.  Why should I respect a capricious, mean-minded, stupid God who creates a world which is so full of injustice and pain?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2015/01/30/atheist-stephen-fry-delivers-stunning-answer-when-asked-what-he-would-say-if-he-came-face-to-face-with-god_n_6581710.html?1422648370|title=Atheist Stephen Fry Delivers Incredible Answer When Asked What He Would Say If He Met God|work=The Huffington Post UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within days, the video was viewed over five million times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/stephen-fry-responds-to-the-meaning-of-life-controversy-1.2093869|title=Stephen Fry responds to The Meaning of Life controversy|author=Rosin Agnew|date=6 February 2015|work=Irishtimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fry later stated he did not refer to any specific religion, and said: "I said quite a few things that were angry at this supposed God. I was merely saying things that [[Bertrand Russell]] and many finer heads of the mind have said for many thousands of years, going all the way back to the Greeks."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/stephen-fry-responds-to-christian-backlash-after-confronting-god-with-bone-cancer-in-children-whats-that-about-10027984.html|title=Stephen Fry responds to Christian backlash after confronting God with 'How dare you create a world in which there is such misery that is not our fault?

===Business===
In 2008, Fry formed SamFry Ltd, with long-term collaborator Andrew Sampson to produce and fund new material and manage his official website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stephenfry.com/misc/about-us/|title=About|publisher=Stephenfry.com|accessdate=4 February 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206235654/http://www.stephenfry.com/misc/about-us|archivedate=6 February 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fry is the co-owner, with Gina Carter and [[Sandi Toksvig]], of Sprout Pictures, an independent film and television company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sproutpictures.com/|title=Sprout Pictures is an independent Film and Television production company owned by Gina Carter and Stephen Fry.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
