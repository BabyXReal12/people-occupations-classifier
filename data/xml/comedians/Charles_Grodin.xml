'''Charles Grodin''' (born April 21, 1935) is an American actor, comedian, author, and former television talk show host. Grodin began his acting career in the 1960s appearing in [[TV serial]]s including ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]''. He had a small part as an [[obstetrician]] in [[Roman Polanski]]'s ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]'' in 1968. In the 1970s he moved into film acting, including playing the lead in ''[[The Heartbreak Kid (1972 film)|The Heartbreak Kid]]'' (1972) and supporting roles in ''[[Catch-22 (film)|Catch-22]]'' (1970) and ''[[Heaven Can Wait (1978 film)|Heaven Can Wait]]'' (1978). He became a familiar face as a supporting actor in many Hollywood comedies of the era, including ''[[Real Life (1979 film)|Real Life]]'' (1979), ''[[Seems Like Old Times (film)|Seems Like Old Times]]'' (1980), ''[[The Incredible Shrinking Woman]]'' (1981), ''[[The Great Muppet Caper]]'' (1981), ''[[The Woman in Red (1984 film)|The Woman in Red]]'' (1984), ''[[The Lonely Guy]]'' (1984), ''[[Ishtar (film)|Ishtar]]'' (1987), ''[[The Couch Trip]]'' (1988), ''[[Taking Care of Business (film)|Taking Care of Business]]'' (1990), and ''[[Dave (film)|Dave]]'' (1993). 

He is perhaps best known for his appearances on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' and ''[[Late Show (CBS TV series)|The Late Show]]'', for co-starring alongside [[Robert De Niro]] in the classic action comedy ''[[Midnight Run]]'' (1988), and for his role as George Newton in the 1990s [[Ivan Reitman]]-produced comedy [[Media franchise|franchise]] ''[[Beethoven (film)|Beethoven]]''.

Grodin has won several acting awards, including [[American Comedy Award|American Comedy Award for Funniest Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture]] for ''Dave'', Best Actor at the 1988 [[Valladolid International Film Festival]] for ''Midnight Run''. He was nominated for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy]] for ''The Heartbreak Kid'' in 1972. He also shared a 1978 [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Variety, Music or Comedy Program]] for his work on ''The Paul Simon Special''.

In the mid-1990s, Grodin retired from acting to become a talk show host on [[CNBC]] and in 2000 a political commentator for ''[[60 Minutes II]]''. He has written several autobiographical and acting related works, including 1990's ''It Would Be So Nice If You Weren't Here: My Journey Through Show Business'' and 1994's ''We're Ready for You, Mr. Grodin''. However, he has recently returned to acting.

==Early life==
Grodin was born in [[Pittsburgh]], Pennsylvania, to [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] [[Jews and Judaism in the United States|Jewish]] parents,&lt;ref name=foundas&gt;{{cite news |last=Foundas |first=Scott |url=http://www.laweekly.com/2007-05-03/film-tv/don-t-call-it-a-comeback/ |title=Don't Call It a Comeback |work=[[LA Weekly]] |date=2 May 2007 |accessdate=2014-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pine&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/24412/the-heartfelt-kid/| title=The heartfelt kid| last=Pine| first=Dan| work=Jewish News Weekly | publisher=jweekly.com |date=26 November 2004 |accessdate=2014-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lena (née Singer), who worked in the family store and volunteered for disabled veterans, and Theodore I. Grodin, who sold wholesale supplies.&lt;ref name="filmref"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/83/Charles-Grodin.html |title=Charles Grodin Biography (1935–) |publisher=Filmreference.com |accessdate=2013-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; His maternal grandfather was an immigrant from [[Russia]] who "came from a long line of [[rabbi]]s" and moved to [[Pittsburgh]] at the turn of the 20th century. Grodin has an older brother, Jack.&lt;ref name=vancheri&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/ae/books/humanitarian-always-has-been-charles-grodins-main-role-338525/ |title=Humanitarian always has been Charles Grodin's main role |work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] |publisher=Post-gazette.com |date=19 April 2009 |first=Barbara |last=Vancheri  |accessdate=2013-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grodin attended the [[University of Miami]] but left without graduating to pursue acting.&lt;ref name=pitt&gt;{{cite news| title=Playhouse provided training ground for Grodin| url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_YA0AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=7pYEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6893,2056534&amp;dq=charles-grodin+university+of+miami&amp;hl=en| last=Grodin| first=Charls| date=5 September 1989| work=[[Pittsburgh Press]]| accessdate=2014-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Early career-1950s/1960s===
Grodin's film debut was an uncredited bit part in [[Disney]]'s 1954 film ''[[20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1954 film)|20,000 Leagues Under the Sea]]''.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} A student of [[Lee Strasberg]] and [[Uta Hagen]], he made his Broadway debut in a production of ''[[Tchin-Tchin]]'', opposite [[Anthony Quinn]].&lt;ref name=Brennan&gt;{{cite web |last=Brennan |first=Sandra |title=Charles Grodin Information Biography |url=http://www.allrovi.com/name/charles-grodin-p28942 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111023104549/http://www.allrovi.com/name/charles-grodin-p28942 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=23 October 2011 |publisher=All Rovi.com |accessdate=18 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965, he became an assistant to director [[Gene Saks]] and appeared on several television series including ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]''.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Grodin had a small  but pivotal part playing an [[obstetrician]] in the 1968 horror film, ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]''. In 1964, he played Matt Stevens on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] soap opera ''[[the Young Marrieds]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=TV Guide Guide to TV|year=2004|publisher=Barnes and Noble|isbn=0-7607-5634-1|page=716}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the late 1960s, he also co-wrote and directed ''Hooray! It's a Glorious Day...and All That'', a Broadway play, and directed ''[[Lovers and Other Strangers]]'' and ''[[Thieves (play)|Thieves]]'', also on Broadway.&lt;ref name=ibdb&gt;{{Cite web| title=Thieves| url=http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=3325| publisher=Internet Broadway Database| accessdate=2014-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also directed [[Simon and Garfunkel]]'s television special ''Songs of America'' in 1969.  However, he turned down the part of Benjamin Braddock in ''[[The Graduate]]'' because of the low salary offered by producer [[Lawrence Turman]], although Turman assured him that the part would make him a star, as it ultimately did for [[Dustin Hoffman]].

===1970s and 1980s film work===
After a supporting role in the 1970 comedy film ''[[Catch-22 (film)|Catch-22]]'', Grodin gained recognition as a comedy actor when he played the lead role in the 1972 film ''[[The Heartbreak Kid (1972 film)|The Heartbreak Kid]]''. Grodin subsequently appeared in several  films during the decade, including ''[[11 Harrowhouse]]'' in 1974, the 1976 version of ''[[King Kong (1976 film)|King Kong]]'' and the hit 1978 comedy ''[[Heaven Can Wait (1978 film)|Heaven Can Wait]]''. During the 1970s, he also frequently appeared on Broadway and was involved in producing several plays.

In 1981, he landed in a role in ''[[The Great Muppet Caper]]'' playing Nicky Holiday, a jewel thief who falls in love with [[Miss Piggy]]. He also appeared that same year opposite Lily Tomlin in ''[[The Incredible Shrinking Woman]]''. His 1980s roles included [[Neil Simon]]'s ''[[Seems Like Old Times (film)|Seems Like Old Times]]'' (opposite [[Chevy Chase]] and [[Goldie Hawn]]) and 1988's well-reviewed comedy ''[[Midnight Run]]'', a [[buddy movie]] co-starring [[Robert De Niro]]. Grodin also appeared in the 1986 CBS mini-series sendup ''[[Fresno (TV miniseries)|Fresno]]'', playing the evil son of a raisin matriarch ([[Carol Burnett]]).

His Hollywood film roles of the 1980s usually saw him cast as uptight, bland and world-weary [[White-collar worker|white collar]] professionals, such as a psychiatrist having a nervous breakdown (''[[The Couch Trip]]''), a health conscious accountant (''Midnight Run''), an ineffectual advertising executive (''[[Taking Care of Business (film)|Taking Care of Business]]''), and a lonely, socially awkward nerd (''[[The Lonely Guy]]''). He was cast against this type as a scheming CIA agent in ''[[Ishtar (film)|Ishtar]]''.

Commenting on his work with regard to ''Ishtar'', Hal Hinson in the Washington Post observed:  "Grodin has a one-of-a-kind quality on the screen, a sort of inspired spinelessness. And with his cat-burglar rhythms – he seems to play all his scenes as if someone were asleep in the next room – he's become a very sly scene-stealer."&lt;ref name=Hinson-05-15-1987&gt;{{cite news| last=Hinson| first=Hal| title=Ishtar| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/ishtarpg13hinson_a0c971.htm| accessdate=18 October 2011| newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]| date=15 May 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sandra Brennan at Rovi noted that: "Whereas many funnymen have been popular for their ability to overreact and mug their way around everyday obstacles, Grodin belonged, from the beginning, to the [[Bob Newhart]] school of wry comedy that values understatement and subtlety."&lt;ref name="Brennan"/&gt;

Aside from his film work, he was a frequent presence on television. In 1977, Grodin hosted an episode of the [[NBC]] sketch show, ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', where the entire episode revolved around his forgetting that the show was live, and he proceeded to wreck sketches because of his failure to prepare accordingly.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} His many talk show appearances from the 1970s to the present have often included confrontational and mock angry segments. At one time [[Johnny Carson]] "banned" him from ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' appearances after taking offense at things Grodin had said. The NBC network would receive angry letters from viewers who didn't understand the joke, that he was playing a persona, trying to be as different from typical talk show guests as possible. His appearances on ''[[Late Night With David Letterman]]'' would sometimes erupt into shouting and name-calling, but Letterman always enjoyed Grodin's segments.

===1990s and recent return to acting===
Grodin's career took a turn in 1992, when he played the nervous family man George Newton in the kids' comedy ''[[Beethoven (film)|Beethoven]]'', opposite [[Bonnie Hunt]]. The film was a box-office hit, and he reprised the role in the 1993 sequel, ''[[Beethoven's 2nd (film)|Beethoven's 2nd]]''. After a supporting role in the acclaimed [[Ivan Reitman]] comedy ''[[Dave (film)|Dave]]'', Grodin took a lead role in ''[[My Summer Story|It Runs in the Family]]'' (a.k.a. ''My Summer Story''), which received a limited theatrical release in 1994. That same year also saw the much-delayed release of ''[[Clifford (film)|Clifford]]'', in which Grodin portrayed the frustrated uncle opposite [[Martin Short]]'s title role. After a 12-year-long hiatus from film, Grodin returned to acting in the [[Zach Braff]] comedy ''[[The Ex (2006 film)|The Ex]]'' (2006).&lt;ref name=ex&gt;{{cite web| title=The Ex| url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0458364/| publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]| accessdate=2014-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Charlesgrodin.jpg|thumb|Grodin at the Book Expo 2007 at the Javits Center, New York City]]
Grodin made more frequent acting appearances in the 2010s. After guest starring on television shows such as ''[[The Michael J. Fox Show]]'' and starring in a recurring role on ''[[Louie (U.S. TV series)|Louie]]'', Grodin had several supporting roles in films, including [[Barry Levinson]]'s ''[[The Humbling (film)|The Humbling]]'' and [[Noah Baumbach]]'s ''[[While We're Young (film)|While We're Young]]''.

=== Talk show host ===
From 1995 to 1998, Grodin hosted his own issues-oriented talk show, ''[[The Charles Grodin Show]]'', on [[CNBC]] and, starting in 2000, became a political commentator for ''[[60 Minutes II]]''. In 2004, Grodin wrote ''The Right Kind of People'', an [[Off-Broadway]] play about [[cooperative|co-op]] boards in certain buildings in [[Manhattan]]. Grodin's commentaries continue to be heard on New York City radio station [[WCBS (AM)|WCBS]] and other affiliates of the [[CBS Radio Network]], as well as on the [[CBS Radio Network]]'s ''[[CBS News Weekend Roundup|Weekend Roundup]]''.

=== Author ===
He is also a best-selling{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} author; his works include ''It Would Be So Nice If You Weren't Here'', ''Just When I Thought I'd Heard Everything: Humorous Observations on Life in America'' and ''How I Get Through Life''. His book, ''If I Only Knew Then...Learning from Our Mistakes'' was released in November 2007 by [[Springboard Press]]. It is a collection of essays from his famous friends (and friends of friends), with all author proceeds going to the [[Help USA]] charity. His book ''How I Got To Be Whoever It Is I Am'' came out in April 2009.

==Personal life==
Grodin has two children: daughter Marion (a comedian), from his marriage to Julie Ferguson, and son, Nicholas, from his marriage to Elissa Durwood.&lt;ref name=strauss&gt;{{cite news|last=Strauss |first=Robert |url=http://articles.philly.com/1997-01-27/entertainment/25559933_1_charles-grodin-grodin-show-cnbc/2 |title=Getting Serious Charles Grodin, Veteran Of Many Flaky Film Roles, Is Using His Cable Talk Show To Speak Out About Important Social Issues. ``this Is Thrilling To Me,'&amp;#39; He Says| work=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]] |publisher=Articles.philly.com |date=27 January 1997|accessdate=2014-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=glassman&gt;{{cite news| first=Marvin| last=Glassman| url=http://www.sun-sentinel.com/florida-jewish-journal/news/miami-dade-county-news/fl-jjdc-grodin-0130-20130130,0,3030905.story |title=Comedienne stars in 'Growing up Grodin' |work=[[Sun-Sentinel]] |date=30 January 2013 |accessdate=2014-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gothamcomedyclub.com/comedian.cfm?id=454 Charles Grodin]; Gotham Comedy Club.
