==Early life==
Dennis was born in [[Garston, Liverpool|Garston]], [[Liverpool]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/liverpool-entertainment/echo-entertainment/2010/02/08/comic-les-dennis-takes-the-cast-from-disney-s-high-school-musical-2-stage-show-to-meet-schoolchildren-at-liverpool-charity-kind-s-seed-centre-100252-25783984/ |title=Liverpool Echo.co.uk – Entertainment – ECHO Entertainment News – Comic Les Dennis takes the cast from Disney’s High School Musical 2 stage show to meet schoolchildren at Liverpool charity KIND's SEED Centre |publisher=liverpoolecho.co.uk |accessdate=13 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His father worked in a [[bookmaker|betting shop]] after serving in the [[Royal Navy]] during [[World War II]], and was listed as a football player on the books of [[Liverpool F.C.]] (but did not play for the first team).&lt;ref name="Rice"&gt;{{cite news|first=Jimmy |last=Rice |title=CELEBRITY KOP CLUB: LES DENNIS |publisher= |url=http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/news/archivedirs/news/2007/jan/4/N154565070104-1350.htm |pages= |accessdate=2 November 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080524040511/http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/news/archivedirs/news/2007/jan/4/N154565070104-1350.htm |archivedate=24 May 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother worked in a factory. For a while, he lived in [[Speke]] and attended the Stockton Wood and Joseph Williams primary schools, and [[Calderstones School|Quarry Bank High School]] after passing the [[Eleven plus exam|11-plus]], by which time his family had moved to [[Childwall]].&lt;ref name=Mustgoon&gt;{{cite book|year=2008|author=Les Dennis|isbn=978-0-7528-9096-8|title=Must The Show Go On?|publisher=Orion}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had a Saturday job in men's clothing store Burton's while still at school, and started in entertainment as a [[stand-up comedian]] in [[working men's club]]s.

==Career==

===Early work and ''Family Fortunes''===
As a comedian Dennis worked the [[North West England|North West]] social and working men's clubs. He was given his earliest opportunities by Liverpool-based husband and wife theatrical agents Stuart and Dorene Gillespie (who had themselves been a successful variety act) and whom Dennis in his autobiography credits with discovering him. His debut radio broadcast was in 1971 on Stuart's BBC Radio Merseyside series ''Variety Time'' (the programmes were taped in front of a live audience in Merseyside clubs). In 1974, he won ''[[New Faces]]'', an [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] talent show and appeared on numerous light-entertainment shows. Dennis almost became the first contestant ever to score the maximum 120 points on ''New Faces''; but had to settle for 119 when [[Tony Hatch]] gave him 9 out of 10 in his final mark, drawing derision from the rest of the panel that included [[Arthur Askey]].

In 1982, he joined as one of the team on ''[[Russ Abbot's Madhouse]]'' and ''[[The Russ Abbot Show]]'' before forming a comedy partnership with fellow impressionist [[Dustin Gee]], which in turn led to a series of their own, ''The Laughter Show''. Following Gee's sudden and unexpected death on 3 January 1986, Dennis carried on ''The Laughter Show'' as a solo performer and became the third host of ''[[Family Fortunes]]'' for a fifteen-year run from 1987 to 2002. It was at a recording of an episode of Family Fortunes in 1997 that Les Dennis was surprised by the ''[[This Is Your Life (UK TV series)|This Is Your Life]]'' team, with host [[Michael Aspel]] coming onto the set just at the conclusion of one episode to present Les with the "big red book" and to say "This is your life" to a shocked Dennis. Aspel had arranged for the ''Family Fortunes'' buzzer to keep sounding at the end of the episode where Dennis usually says goodbye to the viewers, and to have the words "Les Dennis Tonight..." appear on the ''Family Fortunes'' big studio screen, much to the bewilderment of Dennis, who realised what was happening only when he turned around and saw Michael Aspel walking onto the set.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOjW31ymfAQ&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theatre===
His theatre work included Amos Hart in ''[[Chicago (musical)|Chicago]]'', Bill Snibson in ''[[Me and My Girl]]'' in the West End.

He starred with [[Christopher Cazenove]] and [[John Duttine]] in a national tour of ''[['Art']]'' and as Norman Bartholomew in [[Anthony Shaffer (writer)|Anthony Shaffer]]'s dark comedy ''[[Murderer]]'' at London's [[Menier Chocolate Factory]]. He also starred in a hit season in ''Neville's Island'' at [[Birmingham Repertory Theatre]].

He appeared in the role of Mr Fulton in "[[High School Musical 2]]" in a UK tour from late August 2009 to February 2010. He had also made an appearance on two episodes of ''[[Bang Bang, It's Reeves and Mortimer]]'' in The Club sketch, where he played himself. He also took part in a [[VHS|video]]-only special of ''[[Shooting Stars (TV series)|Shooting Stars]]'' in 1993, where [[Vic Reeves]] introduced him pronouncing his name as if it were French saying "Les Dennis, the French [[fire engine]]". He toured in [[Hairspray (musical)|''Hairspray'']] as Wilbur Turnblad alongside [[Michael Ball (singer)|Michael Ball]], [[Brian Conley]] and [[Michael Starke (actor)|Michael Starke]] – who alternated the role of Edna Turnblad. In 2012 he starred in the touring production of ''[[Legally Blonde (musical)|Legally Blonde The Musical]]'' playing the role of Professor Callahan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legallyblondethemusical.co.uk/tour/cast/les-dennis/ |title=Les Dennis &amp;#124; Legally Blonde Tour |publisher=Legallyblondethemusical.co.uk |date=30 January 2012 |accessdate=12 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512004520/http://www.legallyblondethemusical.co.uk/tour/cast/les-dennis/ |archivedate=12 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
