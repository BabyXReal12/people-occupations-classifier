'''Nicholas Offerman''' (born June 26, 1970) is an American actor, writer, comedian, and woodworker who is known for his role as [[Ron Swanson]] in the [[NBC]] sitcom ''[[Parks and Recreation]]'', for which he received the [[Television Critics Association Awards|Television Critics Association Award]] for Individual Achievement in Comedy. Offerman is also known for his role in ''[[The Founder]]'', in which he portrays [[Dick McDonald]], one of the brothers who developed the fast food chain [[McDonald's]]. His first major television role since the end of ''Parks and Recreation'' was as Karl Weathers in the [[FX (TV channel)|FX]] series [[Fargo (season 2)|''Fargo'']], for which he received a [[Critics' Choice Television Award]] nomination for [[Critics' Choice Television Award for Best Supporting Actor in a Movie/Miniseries|Best Supporting Actor in a Movie/Miniseries]].

==Early life==
Offerman was born in [[Joliet, Illinois]] and grew up in [[Minooka, Illinois]].&lt;ref name="MRyan" /&gt; He is the son of Cathy (''née'' Roberts), a nurse, and Ric Offerman, who taught social studies at a junior high school in nearby [[Channahon, Illinois|Channahon]].&lt;ref&gt;"Local News", ''[[The Herald-News]]'' (Joliet), November 30, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1997-10-19/features/9710190341_1_big-party-show-eyes|title=Cast party: When NBC's "ER" drew a large national audience... – Chicago Tribune|first=|date=October 19, 1997|website=|publisher=Articles.chicagotribune.com|access-date=2014-01-02|author=Ken O'Brien|accessdatetp=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Offerman was raised [[Catholic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rock &amp;#039;n Roll Ghost |url=http://rocknrollghost.com/2011/05/19/tv-interview-nick-offerman-parks-and-recreation-nbc |title=TV Interview: Nick Offerman – Parks and Recreation (NBC) |publisher=Rocknrollghost.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/tv/blog/2010/02/_one_of_the_sec.html |title=Nick Offerman, deadpan man – Viewer Discretion |publisher=Boston.com |date=February 24, 2010 |accessdate=2014-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received a [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] degree from the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]] in 1993.&lt;ref name="MRyan" /&gt; That year, he and a group of fellow students co-founded the [[Defiant Theatre]], a Chicago-based theatre company.&lt;ref name="MRyan" /&gt;

==Career==

===Acting===
Offerman lived in Chicago in the mid-1990s, where he participated with theatre companies such as [[Steppenwolf Theatre Company|Steppenwolf]], [[Goodman Theatre|Goodman]], and Wisdom Bridge. At Steppenwolf, he also worked as a [[fight choreographer]] and [[carpenter (theatre)|master carpenter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Erik|last=Adams|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/showrunner-michael-schur-on-building-parks-and-rec,81611/2/ |title=Showrunner Michael Schur on building Parks And Recreation's fourth season (Part 4 of 5) &amp;#124; TV &amp;#124; The Walkthrough |publisher=The A.V. Club |date=June 21, 2012 |accessdate=September 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, Offerman became acquainted with [[Amy Poehler]], who was heavily involved with the Chicago [[improvisational theatre|improv comedy]] scene.&lt;ref name="MRyan"&gt;{{Cite news |first=Maureen|last=Ryan |title=Nick Offerman serves up solid comedy on "Parks and Recreation" |work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|url=http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/2009/09/parks-and-recreation-nick-offerman.html |date=September 23, 2009|accessdate=October 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, he married ''[[Will &amp; Grace]]'' actress [[Megan Mullally]] and has also appeared on her talk show, ''[[The Megan Mullally Show]]''. At the same time, he began appearing on television: as a plumber on ''Will &amp; Grace'' during its fourth season's [[Thanksgiving]] episode, on ''[[The King of Queens]]'', in three episodes of ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'', and in an episode of ''[[The West Wing]]''. Prior to ''Parks and Recreation'', his most prominent role was as factory worker and [[List of George Lopez characters#Benny Lopez|Benny Lopez]]'s love interest Randy McGee on ''[[George Lopez (TV series)|George Lopez]]''. He appeared twice on ''[[Gilmore Girls]]'', in 2003's "The Festival of Living Art" and 2005's "Always a Godmother, Never a God". Offerman played would-be assassin of [[Wild Bill Hickok]], Tom Mason, in an early episode of the [[HBO]] series ''[[Deadwood (TV series)|Deadwood]]'' and in the third-season episode of ''[[Monk (TV series)|Monk]]'', "Mr. Monk and the Election" as a helper for the campaign of Natalie Teeger.  In 2007, Offerman co-starred in the [[Comedy Central]] series ''[[American Body Shop]]''.

[[File:Parks and Recreation Full Cast 2012.jpg|thumb|right|Offerman with the cast of Parks and Recreation in 2012]]
In 2009, ''The Office'' producers [[Michael Schur]] and [[Greg Daniels]] offered Offerman a regular supporting role in their [[NBC]] sitcom ''[[Parks and Recreation]]'': that of [[Ron Swanson]], the deadpan, government-hating head of a city parks department and boss of [[Amy Poehler]]'s character [[Leslie Knope]].&lt;ref name="MRyan" /&gt; ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' magazine declared Offerman "''Parks and Recreation&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''s secret weapon", and said he regularly stole scenes and "has a gift for understated physical comedy."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Weiner |first=Jonah |title=You Really Should Be Watching ''Parks and Recreation'' |date=December 2, 2009 |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2237077/ |accessdate=2009-12-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wBivRRNP?url=http://www.slate.com/id/2237077/ |archivedate=February 2, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The role weaves antagonism and political philosophy with humanity, while the intense [[libertarian]] philosophy the character lives out is often played off against the equally intense liberalism and 'do-gooder' mentality of Poehler's character.  Offerman said that supporting parts such as that of ''Parks and Recreation'' are his ideal roles, and that he draws particular inspiration from Reverend [[Jim Ignatowski]], the character played by [[Christopher Lloyd]] in the sitcom ''[[Taxi (TV series)|Taxi]]''.&lt;ref name="MRyan" /&gt;

Offerman has also been featured in the [[Adult Swim]] series ''[[Childrens Hospital (TV Series)|Childrens Hospital]]'' with [[Rob Corddry]] and [[Rob Huebel]]. He is the voice of Axe Cop in the animated series of the [[Axe Cop (TV series)|same name]] that premiered on July 27, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://screencrush.com/fox-axe-cop-cast-premiere-date/ |title=FOX RELEASES 'AXE COP' VOICE CAST, SETS SATURDAY ANIMATION DOMINATION HD PREMIERE |last=Fitzpatrick |first=Kevin |date=January 8, 2013 |website=ScreenCrush |publisher= |accessdate=May 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, Offerman portrayed [[Johnny Cool]] in the "Boston" episode of [[Derek Waters]]' ''[[Drunk History]]'' on [[Comedy Central]].

Offerman has appeared in films, such as ''[[November (2004 film)|November]]'' (2004), ''[[Cursed (2005 film)|Cursed]]'' (2005), ''[[Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous]]'' (2005), ''[[Sin City (film)|Sin City]]'' (2005), ''[[The Men Who Stare at Goats (film)|The Men Who Stare at Goats]]'' (2009) and ''[[The Kings of Summer]]'' (2013). He also appeared in the 2006 film ''[[Wristcutters: A Love Story]]'' as a cop who attempts to arrest [[Shannyn Sossamon]]'s character, Mikal. 2012 saw him in two film roles, as ''[[21 Jump Street (film)|21 Jump Street]]'''s Deputy Chief Hardy and in ''[[Casa de Mi Padre]]'' as DEA Agent Parker. He reprised his role as Deputy Chief Hardy in ''[[22 Jump Street]]'' two years later. Additionally, he starred in and produced an independent film, ''[[Somebody Up There Likes Me (2012 film)|Somebody Up There Likes Me]]'' (2012), shot in Austin, Texas. He appeared in the 2013 comedy ''[[We're the Millers]]'', which starred [[Jason Sudeikis]] and [[Jennifer Aniston]], and voiced MetalBeard in ''[[The Lego Movie]]''. Offerman conceived of and starred in punk band [[FIDLAR]]'s 2013 video for their song "Cocaine".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/earshot/how-punk-band-fidlar-recruited-592622|title=How Punk Band FIDLAR Recruited 'Parks and Rec' Star Nick Offerman for NSFW Video (Q&amp;A)|publisher=hollywoodreporter.com|accessdate=November 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Offerman also played an alcoholic college guidance counselor in ''[[Believe Me (film)|Believe Me]]'' (2014). Offerman played the [[Recurring character|recurring role]] Karl Weathers in the second season of ''[[Fargo (TV series)|Fargo]] '' (2015). Offerman voiced Grandpa Mike alongside wife Megan Mullally who voiced Grandma Linda in ''[[Hotel Transylvania 2]]'' (2015). He portrayed the first establisher of McDonald's, [[Dick McDonald]], in ''[[The Founder]]'' (2016).

===Woodworking===
In addition to acting, Offerman is also a professional boat builder and has a side business as a wood craftsman. Offerman makes furniture and other wooden structures such as canoes and boats at his woodshop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.offermanwoodshop.com/|title=Offerman Woodshop|publisher=offermanwoodshop.com|accessdate=September 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also released an instructional DVD in 2008 titled ''Fine Woodstrip Canoe Building with Nick Offerman'', shot by [[Jimmy DiResta]]. Diresta's pay for shooting the DVD was a canoe, the second Offerman has built.&lt;ref name="aoh"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adamcarolla.com/AHBlog/2011/01/14/ace-on-the-house-premier/ |title=Ace on the House Premier |date=January 14, 2011 |publisher=adamcarolla.com |accessdate=September 6, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120701044616/http://www.adamcarolla.com/AHBlog/2011/01/14/ace-on-the-house-premier/ |archivedate=July 1, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
[[File:Nick Offerman and Megan Mullally Nude (12165557835).jpg|thumb|right|Mullally and Offerman at the 2014 [[Sundance Film Festival]]]]
Offerman married actress [[Megan Mullally]] on September 20, 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fox|first=Jesse David|title=The History of Nick Offerman and Megan Mullally's Awesome Marriage|url=http://www.vulture.com/2013/03/history-of-offerman-and-mullallys-marriage.html|publisher=Vulture|accessdate=March 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They met while acting in ''The Berlin Circle'',&lt;ref name=Huff1&gt;{{cite web|title=Nick Offerman Talks Costarring With Wife Megan Mullally|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/29/nick-offerman_n_3355578.html|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=March 31, 2014|date=May 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; a play produced by the Evidence Room Theatre Company, and married after dating for 18 months. While they were dating, Offerman appeared in a guest role on Mullally's sitcom, ''[[Will &amp; Grace]]'', in a 2001 [[Thanksgiving]] episode. He later guest starred in a different role in a 2017 episode. Mullally later had a recurring role on ''[[Parks and Recreation]]'' as [[Ron Swanson]]'s second former wife, Tammy 2. The couple have also appeared together in films such as ''[[The Kings of Summer]]'' and ''[[Smashed (film)|Smashed]]'', as well as performing voice work together in ''[[Hotel Transylvania 2]]''. 

Offerman and Mullally did a live comedy tour in 2016, the theme of which was their sex life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Marah|last=Eakin|url=https://www.avclub.com/nick-offerman-on-middle-aged-sex-and-what-people-get-wr-1798251166|title=Nick Offerman on middle-aged sex and what people get wrong about Ron Swanson|publisher=[[The A.V.

On whether he is a [[libertarian]] like his character Ron Swanson, Offerman has stated, "While I admire the philosophy of the libertarian mindset, I think it's proven to be ineffectual in actual governance. So no, I'm not. I'm a free-thinking American."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=GQ|title=Nick Offerman Goes Undercover on Twitter, YouTube, and Reddit {{!}} Actually Me {{!}} GQ|date=2017-06-28|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhSMPu97fSE|accessdate=2017-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
