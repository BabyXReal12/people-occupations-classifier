'''Ronald Balfour Corbett''', [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (4 December 1930&amp;nbsp;– 31 March 2016) was a Scottish stand-up comedian, actor, writer, and broadcaster, best known for his long association with [[Ronnie Barker]] in the BBC television comedy sketch show ''[[The Two Ronnies]]''. He achieved prominence in [[David Frost]]'s 1960s satirical comedy programme ''[[The Frost Report]]'' (with Barker) and subsequently starred in&lt;!-- First series overlaps with TFR. --&gt; sitcoms such as ''[[No – That's Me Over Here!]]'', ''[[Now Look Here]]'', and ''[[Sorry! (TV series)|Sorry!]]''

==Early life==
Corbett was born in [[Edinburgh, Scotland]], the son of William Balfour Corbett (1898–1974), a master baker, and his London-born wife Annie Elizabeth Corbett (''née'' Main; 1900–1991).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/features/3633106/Family-detective.html |title=Family detective |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=23 June 2007 |first=Nick |last=Barratt |accessdate=12 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had a brother about six years younger, and a sister about ten years younger.&lt;ref name="DIDiscs RC"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Desert Island Discs with Ronnie Corbett |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/factual/desertislanddiscs_20071021.shtml |series=Desert Island Discs |serieslink=Desert Island Discs |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]] |airdate=21 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corbett was educated at [[James Gillespie's High School]] and the [[Royal High School (Edinburgh)|Royal High School]] in the city, but did not attend university.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-35934024| title = Ronnie Corbett, best known for The Two Ronnie, dies aged 85 |date = 31 March 2016 | accessdate = 31 March 2016 | publisher = BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; After leaving school, he decided he wanted to be an actor while performing in amateur theatricals at a church youth club.&lt;ref name=itv&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.itv.com/news/2016-03-31/its-goodnight-from-him-a-look-back-at-ronnie-corbetts-life/ | publisher = [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] | title = It's goodnight from him: A look back at Ronnie Corbett's life | date = 31 March 2016 | accessdate = 31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His first job, however, was with the [[Ministry of Agriculture]].&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;

Corbett served his compulsory [[national service]] with the [[Royal Air Force]], during which he was the shortest commissioned officer in the British Forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/8217498/The-One-Ronnie-BBC-One-A-timeline-of-Ronnie-Corbetts-career.html|title=The One Ronnie, BBC One: A timeline of Ronnie Corbett's career|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=21 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A former [[Aircraftman|aircraftman 2nd class]], he was [[commissioned officer|commissioned]] into the secretarial branch of the RAF as a [[pilot officer]] (national service) on 25 May 1950. He received the [[service number]] 2446942.&lt;ref name="LG 4 July 1950"&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=38960|date=4 July 1950|page=3454 |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; He transferred to the reserve (national service list) on 28 October 1951, thereby ending his period of active service.&lt;ref name="LG 2 November 1951"&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=39376|date=2 November 1951|pages=5782–5783 |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was promoted to [[flying officer]] on 6 September 1952.&lt;ref name="LG 16 October 1953"&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=39990|date=16 October 1953|page=5574 |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Following national service, Corbett moved to London to start his acting career.&lt;ref name=guardobit/&gt; At {{convert|5|ft|1|in|m|abbr=on}} tall, Corbett was suited to playing roles younger than his years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0179196/bio|title=Ronnie Corbett|publisher=IMDb|access-date=1 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; References to his height frequently cropped up in his self-deprecating humour. In one of his earliest stage appearances, he was billed as "Ronald Corbett" at [[Cromer]] in ''Take it Easy'' in 1956, with [[Graham Stark]].&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; He appeared in ''[[Crackerjack (TV series)|Crackerjack]]'' as a regular in its early days, one episode with [[Winifred Atwell]]. He had a walk-on in an early episode of the 1960s series ''[[The Saint (TV series)|The Saint]]'' (as "Ronald Corbett") and appeared in films including ''[[You're Only Young Twice (film)|You're Only Young Twice]]'' (1952), ''[[Rockets Galore!]]'' (1957), ''[[Casino Royale (1967 film)|Casino Royale]]'' (1967), ''[[Some Will, Some Won't]]'' (1970) and the film version of the [[farce]] ''[[No Sex Please, We're British (film)|No Sex Please, We're British]]'' (1973).

Corbett starred in the first London production of the musical ''[[The Boys from Syracuse]]'' (as Dromio of Syracuse) in 1963 at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]], alongside [[Bob Monkhouse]].&lt;ref&gt;London Cast Recording. The Boys from Syracuse. Decca Record Company Limited, 1963. LK 4564.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965 he was in cabaret at ''Winston's'', [[Danny La Rue]]'s [[Mayfair]] [[nightclub]]. [[David Frost]] saw him and asked him to appear in ''[[The Frost Report]]''. Corbett was in the West End, playing Will Scarlett in [[Lionel Bart]]'s Robin Hood musical ''[[Twang!!]]''. It failed, leaving Corbett free to accept.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Corbett|Corbett]], pp. 5–7&lt;/ref&gt; It was while working at Danny La Rue's nightclub that Corbett met Anne Hart, who he was to marry that year. The marriage lasted 49 years, until he died.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;

=== With David Frost ===
Corbett first worked with [[Ronnie Barker]] in ''The Frost Report'' (1966–67). The writers and cast were mostly [[Oxbridge]] graduates from the [[Footlights]] tradition. Corbett said he and Barker were drawn together as two [[Grammar schools in the United Kingdom|grammar school]] boys who had not gone to university. The show was a mixture of satirical monologues, sketches and music. Corbett and Barker were beginning to be thought of as a pair.

They appeared with [[John Cleese]] in one of the most repeated comedy sketches in British television: the ''[[Class sketch]]''. Corbett's height provided a key cue for both the visual humour and satirical value of the sketch, as he "looked up" to both Cleese and Barker's characters, and he got the [[punch line|pay-off line]]: "I get a pain in the back of my neck."&lt;ref name = BBC&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/thefrostreport/ |title=BBC&amp;nbsp;– Comedy&amp;nbsp;– The Frost Report |publisher=BBC |accessdate=21 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Continuing under Frost, Corbett starred in ''[[No – That's Me Over Here!]]'', a sitcom written by ''Frost Report'' writers [[Barry Cryer]], [[Graham Chapman]] and [[Eric Idle]] ([[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] 1967–70). Cryer and Chapman wrote two follow-ups: ''[[Now Look Here]]'' ([[BBC]] 1971–73) and ''The Prince of Denmark'' (BBC 1974). Corbett also appeared in ''Frost on Sunday'' (ITV 1968) and hosted ''The Corbett Follies'' (ITV 1969).&lt;ref name=guardobit/&gt;

He was a subject of the television programme ''[[This Is Your Life (UK TV series)|This Is Your Life]]'' in April 1970 when he was surprised by [[Eamonn Andrews]] while appearing on the ''Frost on Sunday'' programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bigredbook.info/ronnie_corbett.html |title=Ronnie CORBETT (1930-2015)
 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=bigredbook.info |publisher= |access-date=19 September 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''The Two Ronnies'' ===
Corbett's [[BBC]] television comedy show with Ronnie Barker, ''[[The Two Ronnies]]'', ran from 1971 to 1987. Barker and Corbett performed sketches and musical numbers. Corbett presented a monologue. Sitting in a large easy chair (emphasising his small size), and usually wearing a [[Lyle &amp; Scott]] golfing V-neck sweater, he would stretch telling a simple joke over several minutes, often allowing himself to appear to lose his train of thought.&lt;ref name=guardobit/&gt;

===Later work===
Corbett's best-known role away from ''The Two Ronnies'' was as the 40-something Timothy Lumsden, dominated by his mother, in the sitcom ''[[Sorry! (TV series)|Sorry!]]'' (1981–88).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/2016/03/31/ronnie-corbett-a-fine-comic-and-an-entertainment-treasure/ | work = The Daily Telegraph | accessdate = 31 March 2016 | date = 31 March 2016 | title = Ronnie Corbett: A fine comic and an entertainment treasure | first = Michael | last = Hogan}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, he appeared on the première of the short-lived BBC game show ''[[Full Swing (game show)|Full Swing]]'', hosted by [[Jimmy Tarbuck]].&lt;ref name=guardobit&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/mar/31/ronnie-corbett-obituary | work = The Guardian | title = Ronnie Corbett obituary | first = Stuart | last = Jeffries | accessdate = 31 March 2016 | date = 31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corbett played Reggie Sea Lions in the film ''[[Fierce Creatures]]'' (1997), written by his former ''Frost Report'' colleague John Cleese.&lt;ref name=guardobit/&gt;

Corbett hosted the game show ''[[Small Talk (UK game show)|Small Talk]]'' and played minor parts occasionally since its end – such as Griselda in a television production of ''[[Cinderella]]'' in 2000, and reviving his armchair monologue routines for a weekly appearance in a stand-up show hosted by [[Ben Elton]]. In 2003, he appeared in advertisements for the [[Sky+]] [[digital television]] service alongside [[Alice Cooper]]. The premise was a running gag about their being happy housemates. In December 2004, Corbett appeared on the BBC news quiz ''[[Have I Got News for You]]''.

In 2005, Corbett teamed up again with Ronnie Barker for ''[[The Two Ronnies Sketchbook]]'', comedy sketches from their original series with newly recorded linking material. Also in March 2005, Corbett appeared with comedian [[Peter Kay]] in the music video for the number one single "[[Is This the Way to Amarillo]]?" to raise money for ''[[Comic Relief]]''. Corbett is remembered for accidentally falling on the treadmill that was out of shot in the [[Chroma key|green screen]] video; however, he found the fall funny when played back, and it was kept in the final version. He performed in ''[[Children's Party at the Palace]]'' as Mr Tibbs, the [[Elizabeth II|Queen]]'s butler.

In 2006, Corbett played a hyper-realised version of himself in ''[[Extras (TV series)|Extras]]'', caught taking drugs at the [[BAFTA Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://metro.co.uk/2016/03/31/his-best-moment-ever-do-you-remember-ronnie-corbetts-epic-cameo-in-extras-5786707/ | title = His best moment ever? Do you remember Ronnie Corbett's epic cameo in Extras? | first = Duncan | last = Lindsay | date =31 March 2016 | accessdate =31 March 2016 | work = Metro}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also starred as himself in ''[[Little Britain Abroad]]'', in which [[Bubbles DeVere]] tried successfully to seduce him. He opened the centre in [[Cromer]], Norfolk, named after [[Henry Blogg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.edp24.co.uk/news/ronnie_corbett_dies_aged_85_1_4477965 | work = Eastern Daily Press | date = 31 March 2015 | accessdate = 31 March 2015 | title = Ronnie Corbett dies aged 85}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corbett was the "castaway" in the [[BBC Radio 4]] show ''[[Desert Island Discs]]'' on 21 October 2007. He featured as a Slitheen in a ''[[Sarah Jane Adventures]]'' episode for [[Red Nose Day]] 2009. He had a television interview about his life on 7 November 2009 for ''[[Piers Morgan's Life Stories]]''.

In February 2010, Corbett was in the [[John Landis]] thriller comedy ''[[Burke &amp; Hare (2010 film)|Burke &amp; Hare]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/18964|title=John Landis' 'Burke &amp; Hare' Goes Behind Cameras!|publisher=Bloody-disgusting.com|date=4 February 2010|accessdate=26 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2010 he was a panellist in the [[BBC 1]] comedy show ''[[Would I Lie to You? (TV series)|Would I Lie to You?]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p009dc0t | title = Did Ronnie Corbett Really Want Four Candles? | date = 13 August 2010| accessdate = 31 March 2016|publisher = BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same month, he was the star of the [[Good Food|Good Food HD]] programme ''[[Ronnie Corbett's Supper Club]]'' with [[Rob Brydon]] and [[Steve Speirs]]. The show's premise was that the main guest of the programme must choose a meal as if it were their last, and Corbett would cook it for him/her and his other guest, while they chatted about the guest's past and their current/future projects. In December of the same year he starred in a one-off special, ''[[The One Ronnie]]''.

From 2010, Corbett starred in the [[BBC Radio 4]] sitcom ''[[When The Dog Dies]]''.&lt;ref name=dog&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2010/may/03/when-dog-dies-ronnie-corbett | title = When The Dog Dies | work = The Guardian | date = 3 May 2010 | accessdate = 31 March 2016|first = Elisabeth | last = Maloney}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series reunited him with Ian Davidson and Peter Vincent, the writers of ''Sorry!''&lt;ref name=dog/&gt; The series returned to BBC Radio Four for another three series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0435c85 | title = When the Dog Dies | publisher = BBC Radio 4 | accessdate = 31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Already an [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] (OBE), Corbett was promoted to [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE) in the [[2012 New Year Honours]] for services to entertainment and charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=60009|date=31 December 2011|page=7 |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Honour for Corbett|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-16364855|work=BBC News|date=31 December 2011|accessdate=4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
On 30 May 1966, Corbett married actress and dancer Anne Hart; they had two daughters, actresses Emma and Sophie Corbett. Their first child, Andrew, had a heart defect and died at six weeks old at [[St Thomas' Hospital]], London.&lt;ref name = "DIDiscs RC" /&gt;

Corbett lived in [[Shirley, London]] for many years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.croydonguardian.co.uk/news/14395356.Goodnight_from_him__Croydon_comedy_legend_Ronnie_Corbett_dies_aged_85/&lt;/ref&gt; He also had a home in [[Gullane]], to the east of Edinburgh in Scotland. He was a [[beekeeper]] and kept hives at his second home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Corbett was a golfer and appeared in celebrity and [[pro–am]] events; in 2009, he made a documentary with [[Colin Montgomerie]] in which they played at [[Gleneagles Hotel|Gleneagles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://programmes.stv.tv/made-in-scotland/presenters/105170-ronnie-corbett-golf/ |title=Ronnie Corbett: golf |publisher=programmes.stv.tv |accessdate=21 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090820201348/http://programmes.stv.tv/made-in-scotland/presenters/105170-ronnie-corbett-golf |archivedate=20 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A keen cricket fan, Corbett was also a president of the cricketing charity the [[Lord's Taverners]] (1982 and 1987).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lordstaverners.org/past-presidents-1980-1989.htm |title=The Lord's Taverners |publisher=lordstaverners.org |accessdate=21 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100330042113/http://www.lordstaverners.org/past-presidents-1980-1989.htm |archivedate=30 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He supported his local [[association football|football]] club, [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace FC]], as well as his hometown club, [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Heart of Midlothian FC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Comedian Ronnie Corbett launches Welsh Premier League |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/19258982 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=14 August 2012 |accessdate=12 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along side his family, his great niece Holly and Rachel Corbett regularly joined him at his second home to look after his bees.

In mid-2014, Corbett attended a party at [[10 Downing Street]] hosted by Conservative Prime Minister [[David Cameron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/2014/07/accept-it-embrace-it-conservatives-arent-cool/|title=Accept it, embrace it: Conservatives aren’t cool|date=5 July 2014|work=[[The Spectator]]|accessdate=2 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2014, Corbett was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to ''[[The Guardian]]'' expressing their hope that Scotland would vote to remain part of the United Kingdom in September's [[Scottish independence referendum, 2014|referendum on that issue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/aug/07/celebrities-open-letter-scotland-independence-full-text |title=Celebrities' open letter to Scotland – full text and list of signatories |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=7 August 2014 |accessdate=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
