==Early life==
Ritch Shydner was born in the small town of [[Pennsville Township, New Jersey|Pennsville]], [[New Jersey]]. He studied [[business]] and [[sociology]] at [[Gettysburg College]]. At Gettysburg College he and sidekick, Camillo "Mad-Dog" Melchiorre, wrote, produced and starred in comedy skits for parents' weekends and fraternity events. Carmen "Honest-Abe" Volpecelli and Pluto "Fenderhead" Dombrosky also contributed to their nearly-famous Used Car Salesman skit. After graduation, Shydner was a substitute teacher in Pennsville, and managed a band. He began to work for a [[congressman]], which sparked his interest in law school. As a student at [[George Mason University]] in [[Fairfax, Virginia]], he decided to become a stand-up comedian. He began writing, and sent material to ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' magazine, and ''[[National Lampoon (magazine)|National Lampoon]]'' but found little success. Shortly thereafter, Shydner started performing stand-up comedy.

In the mid-1970s, Shydner went to open mic nights at local coffeehouses, and began opening for bands in [[Washington, D.C.]] and [[New York City]]. In 1982, he brought his act to [[Los Angeles]]. Slowly he started getting called in to audition for casting directors. Shydner studied acting for about four years, and landed a regular role on ''[[Married... with Children]].''

==Career==
As a stand-up comedian, Shydner appeared on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'', ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'' and ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'' numerous times.

Shydner was featured in the 2010 documentary ''[[I Am Comic]]'', in which he traveled around the country interviewing various comedians, a process that ultimately led to his return to stand-up by going on the stage again after 13 years of retirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117943373?refcatid=31|date=August 22, 2010|title=I Am Comic|author=Harvey, Dennis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an actor, Shydner played [[Al Bundy]]'s co-worker and friend Luke Ventura on ''[[Married... with Children]]'' and made guest appearances on other TV shows such as ''[[Designing Women]]'', ''[[Roseanne (TV series)|Roseanne]]'' and ''[[Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist]]''. His film roles include ''[[Beverly Hills Cop II]]'' and ''[[Roxanne (film)|Roxanne]]''.&lt;ref name="LT"/&gt;

Shydner was a staff writer on such sitcoms as ''[[Roseanne (TV series)|Roseanne]], [[The Jeff Foxworthy Show]]'' and ''[[Titus (TV series)|Titus]]''. He also wrote scripts for the sitcom ''[[Becker (TV series)|Becker]]''. Additionally, he wrote for singers [[Kenny Rogers (country singer)|Kenny Rogers]] and [[Pam Tillis]], as well as [[ventriloquist]] [[David Strassman]].
  
Shydner's influences are [[Art Carney]], [[Lenny Bruce]], [[Red Skelton]] and [[George Carlin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ritch Shyder|url=http://www.pattersonandassociates.com/bios/Ritch_Shydner/|publisher=Patterson and Associates}}&lt;/ref&gt;
