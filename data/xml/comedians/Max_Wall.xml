'''Max Wall''' (12 March 1908 &amp;ndash; 21 May 1990) was an English comedian and actor, whose performing career covered [[music hall]], theatre, films and television.&lt;ref name=bfi&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b9efee33a|title=Max Wall|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Wall was born '''Maxwell George Lorimer''', son of the successful [[music-hall]] entertainer [[Jack Lorimer|Jack (Jock) Lorimer]], a [[Scotland|Scottish]] comedy actor from [[Forfar]], known for his songs and dancing, and his wife Stella (born Maud Clara Mitchison). He was born near [[the Oval]], at 37 Glenshaw Mansions, [[Brixton Road]], [[London]] SW9. In 1916, during a [[World War I]] air raid, Max and his elder brother Alex were saved from death by a cast iron bed frame, but his younger brother Bunty and their Aunt Betty, who was looking after them, were killed by a bomb dropped from a [[Germany|German]] [[Zeppelin]] which also destroyed their house.&lt;ref name=maxwallsociety&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maxwallsociety.org/page3.html|title=Max's Life Page 1|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Max and Alex went to live with their father and his family, whilst their mother went to live with Harry Wallace, whom she had met on tour. When their father died of [[tuberculosis]] in 1920, aged 37, their mother married Harry Wallace, and they all moved to a pub in [[Essex]].&lt;ref&gt;An Audience with Max Wall - BBC Radio 4 - first broadcast 3 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Early career===
Wall auditioned for a part with a touring theatre company, and made his stage début at the age of 14 as Jack in ''[[Mother Goose]]'' with a travelling [[pantomime]] company in [[Devon]] and [[Cornwall]] featuring [[Pantomime dame|George Lacey]]. In 1925 he was a speciality dancer in the [[London Revue]] at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum]].  He became determined not to rely on his father's name, so abbreviated Maxwell to Max, and his stepfather's name Wallace, to Wall.&lt;ref name=voices&gt;{{cite web|url=http://voices-of-variety.com/max-wall/ |title=Max Wall |publisher=Voices of Variety |date= |accessdate=27 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is best remembered for his ludicrously attired and hilariously strutting ''Professor Wallofski''. [[John Cleese]] has acknowledged Wall's influence on his own "[[Ministry of Silly Walks]]" sketch for ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-05-23/news/mn-33_1_max-wall|title=Max Wall; British Dancer-Comedian Gained Fame in Beckett Plays|first1=From|last1=Staff|first2=Wire|last2=Reports|date=23 May 1990|publisher=|via=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; After appearing in many [[Musical theatre|musical]]s and stage comedies in the 1930s, Wall's career went into decline, and he was reduced to working in obscure [[nightclub]]s. He then joined the [[Royal Air Force]] during [[World War II]] and served for three years until he was invalided out in 1943.&lt;ref name=voices/&gt;

Wall married dancer Marion Pola and the couple had five children. In an interview with the family in the mid-1950s, ''[[Tit-Bits]]'' magazine wrote: "The kind of private jokes you find in all the nicest families flourish with the Walls. After Max and his wife, Marion, had their first son, Michael, it seemed kind of natural to make a corner in names beginning with ‘M’, and there are now Melvyn (aged nine), Martin (nearly five) and the four-month-old twins Meredith and Maxine. ... In the same way, because the Walls, like other couples married during the war, were eventually thrilled when they found a house with four walls of their own, they decided to call it just that, only Martin arrived and made it ‘Five Walls’."&lt;ref name=voices/&gt;

In 1955 Wall left Marion and became involved with Jennifer Chimes, that year's [[Miss Great Britain]], who was 26 years his junior and married with children. The couple married in 1956, but the following year Wall collapsed on stage and suffered a [[nervous breakdown]]. Jennifer left him, and although there were reconciliations, he divorced Jennifer for desertion in 1962.&lt;ref name=voices/&gt;

===Re-emergence===
Wall re-emerged during the 1950s when producers and directors rediscovered his comic talents, along with the expressive power of his tragic clown face and the distinctive sad falling cadences of his voice. He secured television appearances and, having attracted [[Samuel Beckett]]'s attention, he won parts in ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'' in 1979 and ''[[Krapp's Last Tape]]'' in 1984.&lt;ref name=page3&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maxwallsociety.org/page3c.html|title=Max's Life Page 4|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966 he appeared as Père Ubu in [[Alfred Jarry|Jarry's]] ''[[Ubu Roi]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npg.org.uk/support/individual/face-to-face/my-favourite-portrait/my-favourite-portrait-by-bill-paterson.php|title=National Portrait Gallery - My Favourite Portrait by Bill Paterson|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1972 he toured with [[Mott the Hoople]] on their "Rock n' Roll Circus Tour", gaining a new audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mottthehoople.com/main/?page_id=103|title=MTH Timeline|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His straight acting gained him this review in 1974: "Max Wall makes [[Laurence Olivier|Olivier]] look like an amateur in ''The Entertainer'' at Greenwich Theatre...".&lt;ref&gt;''The Guardian'', 27 November 1974&lt;/ref&gt;

He also appeared in ''[[Crossroads (soap opera)|Crossroads]]'' (as Walter Soper, 1982 to 1983), ''[[Coronation Street]]'' (as Harry Payne, 1978) and what was then ''[[Emmerdale|Emmerdale Farm]]'' (as Arthur Braithwaite, 1978).&lt;ref name=bfi/&gt; He played ex-con Ernie Dodds in ''[[Minder (TV series)|Minder]]'' in 1982, with [[George Cole (actor)|George Cole]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b744ba705|title=Birdman of Wormwood Scrubs (1982)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later work===
Wall played one of the inventors in the 1968 film ''[[Chitty Chitty Bang Bang]]'' and in 1977 he was seen as King Bruno the Questionable in [[Terry Gilliam]]'s film ''[[Jabberwocky (film)|Jabberwocky]]''.&lt;ref name=bfi/&gt; In the 1970s and 80s, Wall occasionally performed a one-man stage show, ''Aspects of Max Wall'', in which he recaptured the humour of old-time [[music hall]] theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6eede21f|title=Aspects of Max Wall (1975)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 April 1977, Wall's version of [[Ian Dury]]'s song "England's Glory" (which featured in Dury's stage show ''[[Apples (album)|Apples]]'') was issued on [[Stiff Records]] (BUY 12), backed with "Dream Tobacco" and given away with the album ''[[Hits Greatest Stiffs]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stiff-records.com/docs/stiff_discography.xls Stiff Records Catalogue] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716143556/http://www.stiff-records.com/docs/stiff_discography.xls |date=16 July 2011 }} Retrieved 6 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Wall also appeared onstage with Dury at the [[Hammersmith Odeon]] in 1978, but was poorly received, and said "They only want the walk".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Between 1982 and 1984 he appeared as Tombs in the [[BBC Two]] adaptation of ''[[Jane (comic strip)|Jane]]'' based on the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' comic-strip character and filmed with similar "comic-strip frames".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/541765327c81d|title=Jane (1982)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second series his place in the castlist was upgraded to second, after [[Glynis Barber]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b730a6350|title=Jane in the Desert (1984)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His last film appearance was in 1989 in the 12-minute film ''[[A Fear of Silence]]'', a dark tale of a man who drives a stranger to a confession of murder by answering only "yes" or "no" to his questions; those two words, repeated, were his only dialogue.  The film won a gold award in the ''[[New York International Independent Film and Video Festival|New York Film and TV Festival]]''.&lt;ref name=page3/&gt;

==Death==
[[File:MaxWallGrave.jpeg|thumb|upright|Wall's grave in Highgate Cemetery.]]
On the afternoon of 20 May 1990 Wall fell at [[Simpson's-in-the-Strand]] in [[central London]], fracturing his skull. He was conveyed by ambulance to [[Westminster Hospital]] in an unconscious state, but never regained consciousness, and died there early in the next morning, at the age of 82. His body was buried at [[Highgate Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/may/23/max-wall-dies-comedian-clown|title=Master-clown Max Wall dies - archive, 23 May 1990|first=John|last=Ezard|date=23 May 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/9379|title=Max Wall (1908 - 1990) - Find A Grave Memorial|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wall was survived by four sons, Michael, Melvyn, Martin and Meredith, and a daughter, Maxine.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;
