''Wetpaint'' Dec. 29, 2014] Retrieved 11-8-2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Film===
Goldberg's first major screen role was in the [[Billy Crystal]] film ''[[Mr. Saturday Night]]'' (1992). His career-making role was arguably that of the tough, wise-cracking [[infantryman]] Mellish in [[Steven Spielberg]]'s 1998 film ''[[Saving Private Ryan]]''. While he played a lead character in ''[[The Hebrew Hammer]]'', Goldberg has mostly been cast in supporting roles.

Notable roles include Jerry, the [[undead]] servant to [[Christopher Walken]]'s [[Gabriel|Angel Gabriel]] in the supernatural thriller ''[[The Prophecy]]''. Goldberg has also worked with preeminent voice artists like [[Dan Castellaneta]] and [[Charlie Adler]], his vocal performances in ''[[Babe: Pig in the City]]'' and cartoons like ''[[Eek! The Cat]]''. Goldberg often portrays stereotypically Jewish characters (most notably in ''[[Dazed and Confused (film)|Dazed and Confused]]'', ''[[The Hebrew Hammer]]'' and in the TV series ''[[Entourage (U.S. TV series)|Entourage]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.matchflick.com/column/1146|title=ADAM GOLDBERG: Mixed Blessings|website=Matchflick.com|accessdate=2013-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goldberg appeared extensively in the [[Flaming Lips]] documentary ''[[The Fearless Freaks]]'', and had a supporting role in ''[[Christmas on Mars]]'', a science fiction film written and directed by Lips frontman [[Wayne Coyne]]. In 1999, he appeared in the [[Sixpence None The Richer]] music video "[[There She Goes (The La's song)|There She Goes]]".

Goldberg wrote, produced, directed and edited the features ''Scotch and Milk'' and ''[[I Love Your Work]]'', as well as multiple television projects, notably including the philosophical travelogue ''Running with the Bulls'' for [[Independent Film Channel|IFC]].

===Music===
A guitarist and songwriter, Goldberg composed and arranged the music to the ''I Love Your Work'' and ''Running with the Bulls'' and provided a song for the ''Hebrew Hammer'' soundtrack. He is known to travel with a cheap acoustic guitar, as can be seen in ''Running with the Bulls''. Goldberg has released rock and jazz albums, including ''Changes,'' with Latin jazz percussionist Phil Maturano.

He plays in a group named LANDy. LANDy's debut album, ''Eros and Omissions'', was released on June 23, 2009. Flaming Lips drummer [[Steven Drozd]], with whom Goldberg collaborated on the score for ''I Love Your Work'', performed on the record. Earlimart's Aaron Espinoza is credited as having done the final mix as well as having engineered many of the more recent songs.&lt;ref name="WiredReview"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/underwire/2009/06/gear-fetish-energizes-landys-eros-and-omissions-space-pop/ |title=Gear Fetish Energizes Landy's Eros and Omissions Space Pop|accessdate=2011-02-28|last=Thill|first=Scott|date=June 25, 2009|work=[[Wired (website)|Wired]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 7, 2011, Goldberg performed as lead singer with his group The Goldberg Sisters, performing "Shush" on ''[[The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson]]''.

=== Television ===
In 1995, Goldberg appeared in a signature wise-cracking role as delivery boy Leo in the television comedy ''[[Double Rush]]''. Goldberg then appeared in a three-episode arc in the second season of ''[[Friends]]'' (1996)  as [[Chandler Bing|Chandler's]] crazy roommate Eddie. He appeared some years later in a nine-episode arc in season two of the ''Friends'' spinoff show ''[[Joey (TV series)|Joey]]'' as Jimmy, [[Joey Tribbiani]]'s best friend from high school. He also appeared as a main character in the short-lived 2005 [[Fox Network|Fox]] series ''[[Head Cases]]''.

Goldberg appeared in the short-lived ensemble cop show ''[[The Unusuals]]'', playing a detective in New York City with [[brain cancer]] who refuses treatment because of his dislike of doctors. His character was stated as being "sarcastic" and Goldberg had been described as "one of the better reasons to watch".&lt;ref name="NJReview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nj.com/entertainment/tv/index.ssf/2009/04/the_unusuals_oneman_band_the_m.html|title=NJ.com Unusuals Review|accessdate=2011-02-28|last=Sepinwall|first=Alan|date=April 22, 2009|newspaper=[[The Star-Ledger]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently appeared in the short-lived ensemble cop show ''[[NYC 22]].''

Goldberg played the role of Dave Marks, a struggling comedian and [[Jim Gaffigan|Jim Gaffigan's]] best friend, for two seasons on the [[TV Land]] sitcom ''[[The Jim Gaffigan Show]]''.

In 2017 Goldberg joined the cast of [[NBC]]'s ''[[Taken (TV series)|Taken]]'' as a regular cast member during the show's second season. He portrays Kilroy, an accomplished computer hacker.
