'''Ted Knight''' (December 7, 1923 – August 26, 1986) was an American actor and voice artist well known for playing the [[Comedy|comedic]] roles of [[Ted Baxter]] in ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'', Henry Rush in ''[[Too Close for Comfort]]'', and Judge Elihu Smails in ''[[Caddyshack]]''.

== Early years ==
Knight was born '''Tadeusz Wladyslaw Konopka''' in the [[Terryville, Connecticut|Terryville]] section of Plymouth in [[Litchfield County, Connecticut|Litchfield County]], [[Connecticut]], to [[Polish-American]] parents, Sophia (Kavaleski) and Charles Walter Konopka, a bartender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6mFmAAAAMAAJ|title=Newsmakers|first=Peter M.|last=Gareffa|date=1 January 1987|publisher=Gale Research|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knight dropped out of [[high school]] to enlist in the [[United States Army]] in [[World War II]]. He was a member of A Company, 296th Combat Engineer Battalion, earning five [[Service star|battle stars]] while serving in the [[European Theatre of World War II|European Theatre]].&lt;ref name="battlestars"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.billjerome.com/tedknight/hisdeath/bp_860827_we.html | title = Terryville Recalls Favorite Son Fondly | last = Paradis | first = John | publisher = ''The Bristol Press'' | date = 1986-08-27 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081204134424/http://www.billjerome.com/tedknight/hisdeath/bp_860827_we.html | archivedate = 2008-12-04 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Remembering Connecticut’s Ted Knight of 'The Mary Tyler Moore Show,'" Philip R. Devlin, Durham-Middlefield Patch, December 14, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
During the postwar years, Knight studied acting in [[Hartford, Connecticut]]. He became proficient with puppets and ventriloquism, which led to steady work as a television kiddie-show host at [[WJAR|WJAR-TV]] in [[Providence, Rhode Island]], from 1950 to 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pbn.com/WJAR-TV-marks-60th-birthday-tonight,43515 | title= WJAR Turns 60 | publisher= Providence Business News 10 July 2009| accessdate= 8 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billjerome.com/tedknight/misc/pj_550223_we.html |title=WJAR's Ted Knight |publisher=Providence Journal 23 February 1955 |accessdate=8 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205113512/http://www.billjerome.com/tedknight/misc/pj_550223_we.html |archivedate=February 5, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955, he left Providence for [[Albany, New York]], where he landed a job at station WROW-TV (now [[WTEN]]), hosting ''The Early Show,'' featuring MGM movies; and a kids’ variety show, playing a "[[Gabby Hayes]]" type character named "Windy Knight".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.film.com/celebrities/ted-knight/biography/14671061|title=Movies News - MTV|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a radio announcer for sister station [[WROW]] radio. He left the station in 1957 after receiving advice from station manager (and future [[Capital Cities Communications|Capital Cities]] Chairman) [[Thomas Murphy (broadcasting)|Thomas Murphy]] that he should take his talents to [[Hollywood]].

Knight spent most of the 1950s and 1960s doing commercial voice-overs and playing minor television and movie roles.
He had a small part playing a police officer seen guarding the room where Norman Bates, now in custody, sat wrapped in a blanket at the end of [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' (1960).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://movies.nytimes.com/person/38822/Ted-Knight | work=The New York Times | first=Dave | last=Kehr | accessdate=May 25, 2010 | title=Movies: AboutTed Knight}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also guest starred on the [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] [[television series]] ''[[Sea Hunt]]'' with [[Lloyd Bridges]], during the 1961 season in the episode titled "The Defector". In the 1962-1963 season, he appeared as "Haskell" in the short-lived drama and situation comedy ''[[The New Loretta Young Show]]'' on CBS. He played Phil Sterling on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[soap opera]] ''[[The Young Marrieds]]'' in the early 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=TV Guide Guide to TV|year=2004|publisher=Barnes and Nobel|isbn=0-7607-5634-1|pages=716}}&lt;/ref&gt; He appeared frequently in television shows such as ''[[The Invaders]]'', ''[[Highway Patrol (U.S. TV series)|Highway Patrol]]'', ''[[How to Marry a Millionaire (TV series)|How to Marry a Millionaire]]'', ''[[Peter Gunn]]'', ''The Outer Limits'' episode ''[[The Invisible Enemy (The Outer Limits)|The Invisible Enemy]]'', ''[[Bourbon Street Beat]]'', ''[[The Donna Reed Show]]'' (in the episode "April Fool" on April 1, 1959), ''[[Pete and Gladys]]'', ''[[The Eleventh Hour (1962 TV series)|The Eleventh Hour]]'', ''[[Bonanza]]'', ''[[The Man and the Challenge]]'', ''[[Combat!]]'', ''[[McHale's Navy]]'' (including one episode as boy Admiral "Go Go" Granger), ''[[Get Smart]]'', ''[[The Lieutenant]]'', ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'', ''[[Gunsmoke]]'' (as Mr. Rabb, esq.) and ''[[The Wild Wild West]].'' His final movie role was in the golf comedy ''[[Caddyshack]]'', where he played Judge Elihu Smails, who is fed up with the shenanigans of Al Czervik, a guest at his golf club (played by [[Rodney Dangerfield]]).

[[File:Ted and georgette Mary Tyler Moore Show.JPG|thumb|left|Ted Knight and [[Georgia Engel]] on ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'']]
Knight's distinctive speaking voice brought him work as an announcer, notably as narrator of most of [[Filmation]] studio's [[superhero]] cartoons as well as voice of incidental characters.  He was narrator of the first season of the ''[[Super Friends]]'', while other animated television series featuring his work included the voices of the opening narrator and team leader Commander Jonathan Kidd in ''[[Fantastic Voyage (TV series)|Fantastic Voyage]]''.

=== ''The Mary Tyler Moore Show'' ===
His role as the vain and untalented WJM newscaster [[Ted Baxter]] on ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'' brought Knight widespread recognition and his greatest success. He received six [[Emmy Award]] nominations for the role, winning the Emmy for "Outstanding Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role in Comedy" in 1973 and 1976.
=== Notable television appearances ===
Ted Knight was the special guest star on the first episode of ''[[The Bobby Vinton Show]]'' in September of 1975. Vinton highlighted Knight's Polish heritage and the two sang a duet of Vinton's hit [[My Melody of Love]] in Polish. Knight was also featured in a production number featuring his own record "I'm In Love With Barbara Walters" showcasing his singing talent.

In 1975, Knight recorded an album of mostly novelty songs, "Hi Guys", on the Ranwood label (which was co-founded by [[Lawrence Welk]] and re-released many of his earlier albums).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Ted-Knight-Hi-Guys/master/757961|title=Ted Knight - Hi Guys|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title track, in which Knight tries to get out of various embarrassing situations by using his signature "Hi, Guy!" line, received some play on the [[Dr. Demento]] show.

Knight used some of this character's style for regional commercials. In the Cleveland area during the early to late 1970s, a newsman simply known as "Ted" would provide news of the events at a local shopping center known as Southgate USA, often finishing the 60-second spot with a comedic flair, including wearing a jacket that resembled his blue "WJM" blazer. The spots were produced by UAB Productions for Southgate USA. UAB Productions was the local production arm of [[United Artists Broadcasting]], which owned [[WUAB-TV]] in the Cleveland area at that time. Knight also returned to Albany to do some hilarious promo spots for his former employer, WTEN's local news show.

After ''The Mary Tyler Moore Show''{{'}}s run, Knight guest-starred in "Mr. Dennis Steps Out," the October 26, 1977, episode of the situation comedy ''[[Busting Loose (TV series)|Busting Loose]]'', as Roger Dennis, the owner of an [[escort service]] in [[New York City]]. This episode was spun off into its own show, ''[[The Ted Knight Show (1978 TV series)|The Ted Knight Show]]'', giving Knight his first starring role. ''The Ted Knight Show'' was a disappointment, lasting for only six episodes in the spring of 1978.

Knight appeared in a few episodes of ''[[The Love Boat]]'', including one episode as a rival cruise captain, Captain Gunner Nordquist, versus ''Mary Tyler Moore Show'' co-star [[Gavin MacLeod]]'s [[Captain Stubing|Captain Merrill Stubing]]. This was broadcast in March 1982 as Season 5, Episodes 24 and 25, of ''The Love Boat,'' whose segments were titled "Pride of the Pacific," "The Viking's Son," "Separate Vacations," "The Experiment," and "Getting to Know You."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/the-love-boat-1982/episode-24-season-5/pride-of-the-pacific-the-vikings-son-separate-vacations-the-experiment-getting-to-know-you/100488|title=The Love Boat|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Too Close for Comfort'' ===
Knight landed the lead role as the kind, curmudgeonly cartoonist Henry Rush in the series ''[[Too Close for Comfort]]'' in 1980. During scenes in which Henry draws in his bedroom, Knight used his earlier acquired ventriloquism talents for comical conversations with a hand-puppet version of his comic book's main character "Cosmic Cow." Throughout the run of the series, Knight would wear [[sweatshirts]] from various colleges and universities, which were often sent to him by students who were fans of the show.  The show was cancelled by ABC after three seasons, but was revived in first-run syndication in 1984 and proved to still be popular. In 1986, the show became ''The Ted Knight Show'' and saw Henry Rush retire from cartooning and become part owner of a weekly newspaper. The new format allowed the show to remain a hit, and a second season had been planned until his health had become a factor.

== Personal life ==
In 1948, he married Dorothy Smith, and the couple had three children: Ted Jr., Elyse, and Eric.

In January 1985, Knight was awarded a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] for his contributions to the television industry. It is located at 6673 [[Hollywood Boulevard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walkoffame.com/ted-knight|title=Ted Knight - Hollywood Walk of Fame|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death ==
A few months after the end of the ''Mary Tyler Moore Show'' in 1977, Knight was diagnosed with [[cancer]] for which he received various forms of treatment over several years. In 1985, the cancer returned as [[colon cancer]] which, despite rigorous treatment, eventually began to spread to his [[Urinary bladder|bladder]] and throughout his lower [[Human gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal tract]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/27/obituaries/ted-knight-winner-of-2-emmy-awards-for-television-series.html Wilborn Hampton, "Ted Knight, Winner of 2 Emmy Awards For Television Series". ''New York Times'' obituary, August 27, 1986] Retrieved 2011-11-26.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ted Knight grave at Forest Lawn Cemetery in Glendale, California.JPG|thumb|Ted Knight's grave]]
Knight continued to work, even after having surgery to remove a tumor from his urinary tract. However, he experienced complications from the surgery and was advised not to resume work on ''Too Close For Comfort'' until he recovered. Knight's condition continued to worsen and he died on August 26, 1986, at the age of 62.

Knight was interred in the [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale)|Forest Lawn Memorial Park]] in [[Glendale, California]]. His grave marker bears the name ''Theodore C. Konopka'' (and, at the bottom, the words "Bye Guy", a reference to his Ted Baxter [[catchphrase]] "Hi, guy!")

His hometown of Terryville, Connecticut, dedicated the bridge on Canal Street over the [[Pequabuck River]] in his memory. There is a bronze plaque bearing his likeness on the bridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jean |last=Reid |coauthors= |title=Plymouth Dedicates Ted Knight Bridge |url=http://www.billjerome.com/tedknight/hisdeath/wr_870409_th.html |work=[[Republican-American|Waterbury Republican]] |publisher= |date=1987-04-09 |accessdate=2012-05-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130730104930/http://www.billjerome.com/tedknight/hisdeath/wr_870409_th.html |archivedate=2013-07-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
