'''Ralph Duren May''' (February 17, 1972 – October 6, 2017) was an American stand-up comedian and actor, known for his extensive touring and comedy specials on [[Netflix]] and other outlets.

==Early life==
May was born on February 17, 1972, in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/06/obituaries/ralphie-may-brash-comedian-is-dead-at-45.html|title=Ralphie May, 45, Comedian ‘Who Happens to Be Fat,’ Dies|date=6 October 2017|publisher=New York Times|author=Genzlinger, Neil|access-date=October 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and raised in [[Clarksville, Arkansas]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.arkansasmatters.com/news/local-news/comedian-and-clarksville-native-ralphie-may-dead-at-45/829071703|title=Comedian and Clarksville Native, Ralphie May Dead at 45 |date=October 6, 2017|publisher=Arkansas Matters|access-date=October 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the youngest of 4 children.

When he was 16, 42 of his bones were broken in an [[Traffic collision|automobile accident]] while a passenger in a vehicle. At 17, he won a contest to open for [[Sam Kinison]], whom he considered his idol.&lt;ref name="obesity"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2004-05-07/entertainment/0405050977_1_fat-people-weight-opening|title=Ralphie May Succeeds On Stage, But Not By Throwing His Weight Around|last=Rusnak|first=Jeff|publisher=''[[Sun-Sentinel]]''|date=May 7, 2004|access-date=October 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kinison suggested that May move to [[Houston]] to further develop his comedy routine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/entry/ralphie-may-dead-dies-45_us_59d7ecf3e4b0f6eed3505977 |publisher=Huffington Post |title=Ralphie May Dead--Dies 45|date=October 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; May graduated from the [[High School for the Performing and Visual Arts]]. He then moved to [[Los Angeles]] to pursue a career in the entertainment industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/comedian-ralphie-dies-45/story?id=50335884|title=Comedian Ralphie May dies at 45|publisher=ABC|date=October 6, 2017|access-date=October 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In 2003, May was chosen to participate in the first season of ''[[Last Comic Standing#Season 1: Summer 2003|Last Comic Standing]]''. He finished in second place in the competition, with [[Dat Phan]] winning first place. Afterwards, May appeared in comedy shows, such as ''[[The Wayne Brady Show]]'' and ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]''. In 2005, he was the only white comedian on ''The Big Black Comedy Show'', which also featured [[Mo'Nique]], Rodman, and Vince Morris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cc.com/comedians/ralphie-may |title=Ralphie May|publisher=[[Comedy Central]]|accessdate=February 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, May released his first comedy album ''Just Correct''. He later recorded four [[Comedy Central]] specials titled ''Girth of a Nation'' (2006), ''Prime Cut'' (2007),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/420981/Ralphie-May-Prime-Cut/overview Ralphie May: Prime Cut (2007)].

==Personal life==
On July 3, 2005, May married comedian Lahna Turner. The couple had two children: daughter April June May&lt;ref&gt;[http://celebritybabies.people.com/2007/09/17/comedians-ralph/ Comedians Ralphie May and Lahna Turner are new parents] celebritybabies.people.com. September 17, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="heavy.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://heavy.com/entertainment/2017/10/ralphie-may-wife-lahna-turner-comedian-kids-age-dead/|title=Lahna Turner, Ralphie May’s Wife: 5 Fast Facts You Need to Know|website= heavy.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and son August James May.&lt;ref&gt;[http://celebritybabies.people.com/2009/06/26/ralphie-may-welcomes-son-august-james-may/ Ralphie May welcomes a son] celebritybabies.people.com. June 26, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="heavy.com"/&gt; The couple filed for divorce in October 2015 and sought physical and joint custody of their children, but the divorce was never finalized.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tmz.com/2015/10/16/ralphie-may-divorce/ Ralphie May's wife Lahna Turner files divorce] tmz.com&lt;/ref&gt;

May struggled with [[obesity]] throughout his life. His weight increased to {{convert|800|lb|kg}}, following a car accident at age 16.&lt;ref name="obesity" /&gt; He participated on VH1's [[Celebrity Fit Club (U.S. TV series)|Celebrity Fit Club]] and had [[gastric bypass surgery]] in 2004, which lowered his weight by {{convert|350|lb|kg}}.&lt;ref name="obesity" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fit"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tampabay.com/features/performingarts/for-comic-ralphie-may-health-scare-in-tampa-was-life-changing-experience/1204896|title=For comic Ralphie May, health scare in Tampa was life-changing experience|last=Cridlin|first=Jay|publisher=''[[Tampa Bay Times]]''|date=December 5, 2011|accessdate=October 6, 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171007055801/http://www.tampabay.com/features/performingarts/for-comic-ralphie-may-health-scare-in-tampa-was-life-changing-experience/1204896|archivedate=October 7, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a bout with [[viral pneumonia]] on a cruise in October 2011, May lost 40 pounds.&lt;ref name="fit" /&gt;

In November 2011, he suffered a nearly-fatal [[pulmonary embolism]] after contracting serious pneumonia on a cruise ship, where a [[Thrombus|blood clot]] from his leg became lodged in an [[artery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://radiotvtalk.blog.ajc.com/2012/03/14/ralphie-may-almost-died-in-november-of-a-pulmonary-embolism/|title=Ralphie May almost died in November 2011 of a pulmonary embolism|last=Ho|first=Rodney|publisher=AJC|date=October 6, 2017|accessdate=October 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

May discussed his grandmother in a number of interviews and credited her with helping take care of him and his siblings as they were growing up. Speaking to the ''[[Arkansas Times]]'' in 2012, May said, "Thank goodness for my grandmother, she was a hell of a woman. She was really beneficial, she kept us in a stature way above our means and made sure we were taken care of as far as clean clothes and shoes." His [[Facebook]] bio also references his grandmother. "When I was a kid, my grandmother taught me how to crochet and how to quilt, and that's kind of how I do an act. I have one-liners, I have dirty jokes, but I also have long stories that are 10 or 20 minutes long and the laughs come every eight seconds. It's a different set. And it's a different life than most people have led."

In an interview with the ''Arkansas Times'' in 2012, he discussed growing up in Clarksville, shedding light on some of the hardships he faced. He shared, "It was a hard life growing up. It was a similar story to a lot of people in Arkansas. My mom was a florist. I'm the youngest of four. My father and mother hated each other, and they took it out on us. She'd sue him for not paying child support, then he didn't pay, and that ended up costing us a lot..."

In 2013, May and his wife Turner started a podcast together called ''Perfect 10.''

His memoir, ''This Might Get a Little Heavy'', was published in December 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shanley|first1=Patrick|title=Comedian Ralphie May to Pen Humorous Memoir|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/comedian-ralphie-may-pen-humorous-789373|website=Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=21 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
On October 6, 2017, May went into cardiac arrest. May had been battling [[pneumonia]] for several weeks and had cancelled previous shows over the last month, his publicist Stacey Pokluda confirmed following his death. He was 45 years old and is survived by his estranged wife and two children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tmz.com/2017/10/06/ralphie-may-dead/|title=Comedian Ralphie May Dead at 45 of Cardiac Arrest|website=tmz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nemetz|first1=Dave|title=Ralphie May, Stand-Up Comic and 'Last Comic Standing' Finalist, Dead at 45|url=https://www.yahoo.com/tv/ralphie-may-stand-comic-last-212328518.html|website=Yahoo News|accessdate=October 7, 2017|date=October 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later published that hours before his death, May was scheduled to do a meet-and-greet after his final performance at Harrah's in Las Vegas around midnight, but May had already shown signs of his deteriorating condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=|first1=|title=RALPHIE MAY FRAIL AND PALE At Final Meet-and-Greet|url=https://www.tmz.com/2017/10/10/ralphie-may-looked-frail-dead-heart-attack/|website=tmz.com|accessdate=October 11, 2017|date=October 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
