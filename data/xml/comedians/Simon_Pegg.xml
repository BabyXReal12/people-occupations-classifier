Pegg moved to [[Stratford-upon-Avon|Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire]] when he was 16 and studied English Literature and Theatre at [[Stratford-upon-Avon College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stratford.ac.uk/AbouttheCollege/Alumni/SimonPegg.aspx|title=Simon Pegg profile|publisher=Stratford-upon-Avon College: About the College" Alumni|accessdate=23 January 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513125612/http://www.stratford.ac.uk/AbouttheCollege/Alumni/SimonPegg.aspx|archivedate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from the [[University of Bristol]] in 1991 with a BA in Theatre, Film, and Television,&lt;ref name=independent1 /&gt; titling his undergraduate thesis "A [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[Marxist literary criticism|overview]] of popular 1970s cinema and [[cultural hegemony|hegemonic]] discourses".&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt; While there, he performed as a member of a comedy troupe called David Icke and the Orphans of Jesus, alongside [[David Walliams]], [[Dominik Diamond]], and [[Jason Bradbury]].&lt;ref name="autobio"/&gt;

Pegg's early appearances in TV series and films include ''[[Asylum (1996 TV series)|Asylum]]'', ''Six Pairs of Pants'', ''[[Faith in the Future]]'', ''[[Big Train]]'' and ''[[Hippies (TV comedy)|Hippies]]''. Between 1998 and 2004, Pegg was regularly featured on [[BBC Radio 4]]'s ''[[The 99p Challenge]]''. Pegg's other credits include appearances in the World War II [[mini-series]] ''[[Band of Brothers (TV miniseries)|Band of Brothers]]''; the television comedies ''[[Black Books]]'', ''[[Brass Eye]]'' and ''[[I'm Alan Partridge]]''; and the films ''[[The Parole Officer]]'', ''[[24 Hour Party People]]'', and ''[[Guest House Paradiso]]''. He played various roles during the tour of [[Steve Coogan]]'s 1998 live stage show  ''The Man Who Thinks He's It''.&lt;ref name="autobio" /&gt;
[[File:SimonPeggApr09.jpg|upright|thumb|right|Pegg at a [[premiere]] for ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'' in April 2009]]

In 1999, he created and co-wrote the [[Channel 4]] sitcom ''[[Spaced]]'' with [[Jessica Hynes|Jessica Stevenson]]. The series was directed by [[Edgar Wright]], with whom Pegg and Stevenson had previously worked on ''Asylum'', and Pegg wrote the character of Mike Watt specifically for his friend [[Nick Frost]].&lt;ref name="autobio" /&gt; For his performance in this series, Pegg was nominated for a [[British Comedy Awards|British Comedy Award]] as Best Male Comedy Newcomer.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/523406.stm |title=Entertainment &amp;#124; Royle flush in comedy shortlist |publisher=BBC News |date=17 November 1999 |accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The experience of making a ''Spaced'' fantasy sequence featuring [[zombie (fictional)|zombies]] led to Pegg and Wright co-writing the "romantic zombie comedy" film ''[[Shaun of the Dead]]'', released in April 2004, in which Pegg also starred.&lt;ref name="autobio" /&gt; At [[George A. Romero]]'s invitation, Pegg and Wright made cameo appearances in Romero's zombie film, ''[[Land of the Dead]]''.&lt;ref name="autobio" /&gt; In 2004, Pegg starred in a spin-off of the television show ''[[Danger! 50,000 Volts!]]'' called ''Danger! 50,000 Zombies!'', in which he played a zombie hunter named Dr. Fell.

He played [[mutant]] [[bounty hunter]] Johnny Alpha, the [[Strontium Dog]], in a series of [[Big Finish Productions]] [[radio drama|audio play]]s based on the character from British comic ''[[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]]''. Pegg also appeared in Big Finish Productions' ''[[Doctor Who]]'' audio story ''[[Invaders from Mars (Doctor Who audio)|Invaders From Mars]]'' as Don Chaney, and appeared in the ''Doctor Who'' television series, playing [[List of Doctor Who villains#Editor|the Editor]] in the 2005 episode "[[The Long Game]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Simon Pegg plays The Editor (Press release)|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2005/05_may/04/who.shtml|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=31 July 2016|date=4 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also narrated the first series of the "[[making-of]]" documentary series ''[[Doctor Who Confidential]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Do you think Doctor Who Confidential should have been cancelled?|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2011-09-28/do-you-think-doctor-who-confidential-should-have-been-cancelled|work=[[Radio Times]]|accessdate=31 July 2016|date=28 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon completion of ''Shaun of the Dead'', Pegg was questioned as to whether he would be abandoning the British film industry for Hollywood, and he replied, "It's not like we're going to go away and do, I don't know, Mission: Impossible III", picking the title of an imaginary [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]]. When the film ''[[Mission: Impossible III]]'' was subsequently made, Pegg appeared in it as [[Benji Dunn]], an [[Impossible Missions Force|IMF]] technician who assists [[Tom Cruise]]'s character [[Ethan Hunt]].&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt; He reprised the role in the sequel films ''[[Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol]]'' (2011),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/2010/07/18/simon-pegg-returns-for-mission-impossible-4|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120910162832/http://www.slashfilm.com/2010/07/18/simon-pegg-returns-for-mission-impossible-4|dead-url=yes|archive-date=10 September 2012|title=Simon Pegg Returns for Mission: Impossible 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation]]'' (2015), and ''[[Mission: Impossible – Fallout]]'' (2018).

In 2006, he played Gus in ''[[Big Nothing]]'' alongside [[David Schwimmer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bradshaw|first1=Peter|title=Big Nothing|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/dec/01/comedy1|accessdate=31 July 2016|date=1 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, Pegg and Wright completed their second film, ''[[Hot Fuzz]]'', released in February 2007. The film is a police-action movie homage and also stars Nick Frost, in which Pegg plays Nicholas Angel, a London policeman transferred to rural Sandford, a fictional village where grisly events take place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chilton|first1=Martin|title=Hot Fuzz, review|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/filmreviews/11099304/Hot-Fuzz-review.html|accessdate=31 July 2016|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Pegg starred in ''[[The Good Night]]'' (directed by [[Jake Paltrow]]) and ''[[Run Fatboy Run]]'' directed by David Schwimmer and co-starring [[Thandie Newton]] and [[Hank Azaria]]. In 2008, he wrote the dialogue for an English language re-release of the cult 2006 animated Norwegian film, ''[[Free Jimmy]]''. Pegg received screenwriting credit for this, and Pegg also voiced one of the main characters in the English-language version, which has an international range of actors including [[Woody Harrelson]].

Pegg co-wrote the script for a film called ''[[Paul (film)|Paul]]'', about two young men who encounter a comedic [[extraterrestrial alien]] during a road trip across the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/fame/article.html?in_article_id=130146&amp;in_page_id=7&amp;in_a_source=|accessdate=26 May 2009|date=31 March 2008|work=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]|title=Pegg set for road trip flick}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfx.co.uk/2009/04/01/simon_pegg_exclusive|work=[[SFX (magazine)|SFX]]|accessdate=26 May 2009|date=1 April 2009|title=Simon Pegg Exclusive|first=Nick|last=Setchfield}}&lt;/ref&gt; The completed script appeared on the 2008 "Brit List", a film-industry-compiled survey of the best unproduced British screenplays, inspired by the American [[Black List (survey)|Black List]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Thomas, Archie|title=Brit List brings scripts to light|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117993429.html?categoryid=2523&amp;cs=1|work=Variety|date=3 October 2008|accessdate=9 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In those films and in ''Spaced'', Pegg typically plays the leading hero while Frost plays the sidekick. However ''Paul'' reverses this dynamic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.justpressplay.net/movies/movie-news/2006-simon-pegg-and-nick-frost-do-america.html|title=Simon Pegg and Nick Frost Do America| publisher=JustPressPlay.net| accessdate=3 January 2011|date=20 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was later produced, and was released in 2011.

Pegg played engineer [[Montgomery Scott|Montgomery "Scotty" Scott]] in ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'', the eleventh film in the [[Star Trek (film franchise)|''Star Trek'' film series]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117973913.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1|title=Simon Pegg to play Scotty in 'Star Trek'|work=Variety|accessdate=11 October 2007|date=12 October 2007|first=Tatiana|last=Siegel}}&lt;/ref&gt; released 8 May 2009. He reprised the role in the 2013 film ''[[Star Trek Into Darkness]]'' and ''[[Star Trek Beyond]]'' (2016), also co-writing the latter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/may/09/star-trek-into-darkness-review|title=Star Trek Into Darkness – review|last1=Bradshaw |first1=Peter |authorlink=Peter Bradshaw|date= 9 May 2013 |website=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=10 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Ruchinka|last1=Upadhyaya|title=Simon Pegg teases the 'idea of the Federation', calls Star Trek Beyond a 'social commentary'|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/simon-pegg-teases-idea-federation-calls-star-trek-beyond-social-commentary-1571806|website=[[International Business Times]]|accessdate=31 July 2016|date=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 he appeared as [[Burke and Hare|William Burke]] in ''[[Burke and Hare (2010 film)|Burke and Hare]]'', a film directed by [[John Landis]] about two Ulstermen who were notorious murderers and bodysnatchers in early 19th-century [[Edinburgh]]. His likeness was also used for the character of Wee Hughie in the comic book series ''[[The Boys (comic book)|The Boys]]''; while this was done without Pegg's permission, he quickly became a fan of the title, and even wrote the introduction to the first bound volume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ennis|first=Garth|authorlink=Garth Ennis|title=The Boys Volume One: The Name of the Game (Introduction)| publisher=[[Dynamite Entertainment]]|series=The Boys|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He voiced [[Reepicheep]], the heroic mouse in ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader|Chronicles of Narnia: Voyage of the Dawn Treader]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.narniaweb.com/2010/06/simon-pegg-replaces-bill-nighy-as-the-voice-of-reepicheep|title=Simon Pegg Replaces Bill Nighy as the Voice of Reepicheep}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pegg and Wright completed the ''[[Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy]]'' (the first two films being ''[[Shaun of the Dead]]'' and ''[[Hot Fuzz]]'') with their 2013 film ''[[The World's End (film)|The World's End]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7642129.stm|title=Interview with Simon Pegg|accessdate=1 October 2008|publisher=BBC|date=1 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pegg is close friends with [[Coldplay]] lead singer [[Chris Martin]]: Pegg appears as a violin-playing [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]] impersonator in Coldplay's 2010 single "[[Christmas Lights (song)|Christmas Lights]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=12 Great Coldplay Songs You Probably Don't Know|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/12-great-coldplay-songs-you-probably-dont-know-20140820|agency=Rolling Stone|date=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with [[Jonny Buckland]], Pegg is godfather to Apple, daughter of Chris Martin and [[Gwyneth Paltrow]].&lt;ref name=DailyMail1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/article/martin%20paltrow%20name%20pegg%20as%20godfather_1043099|title=Chris Martin&amp;nbsp;– Martin + Paltrow Name Pegg As Godfather|publisher=Contactmusic.com|date=9 September 2007|accessdate=3 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In return, Martin is godfather to Pegg's daughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://coldplay.com/newsdetail.php?id=660|title=Simon Pegg Q&amp;A: "If I don't get recognised, I say I'm in Coldplay"|publisher=Coldplay.com|date=29 October 2010|accessdate=3 January 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110717154333/http://coldplay.com/newsdetail.php?id=660|archivedate=17 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pegg is also godfather to Joe, the son of actor and friend [[Martin Freeman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://crazyformartinfreeman.blogspot.co.uk/2013/07/rough-transcript-from-hitchhikers-guide.html|title=The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Q&amp;A|publisher=blogspot.co.uk|accessdate=13 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pegg's parents and sister briefly appeared in ''[[Spaced]]'', while his mother appeared in both ''[[Shaun of the Dead]]'' and ''[[Hot Fuzz]]''.

In a July 2018 interview with ''[[The Guardian]]'', Pegg opened up about his battle with [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] and [[alcoholism]], and how [[Rehabilitation counseling|rehabilitation]] helped him recover from the latter. He stated: "When I watch [''[[Mission: Impossible III]]''], I can see where I was then, which was fairly lost, and unhappy, and an alcoholic [...] I’m not ashamed of what happened. And I think if anyone finds any relationship to it, then it might motivate them to get well. But I am not proud of it either — I don’t think it’s cool, like I was Mr. Rock ’n’ Roll, blackout and all that s---. It wasn’t, it was just terrible."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.msn.com/en-us/movies/celebrity/simon-pegg-on-battling-alcoholism-depression-it-owned-me/ar-AAzMY1c|title=Simon Pegg on Battling Alcoholism, Depression: "It Owned Me"|website=www.msn.com|language=en-US|access-date=11 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
