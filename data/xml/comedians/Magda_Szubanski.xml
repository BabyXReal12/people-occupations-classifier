==Career==
===Television===
[[File:Sharon Strzelecki (7879439094).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sharon Strzelecki]] is one of Szubanski's most developed characters]]
In 1985, while performing in a [[University of Melbourne]] Law Revue of ''Too Cool for Sandals'', with Michael Veitch and [[Tom Gleisner]], Szubanski was talent-spotted by producers from the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] (ABC), who convinced her to join up with some other university friends in creating a television sketch comedy show, ''[[The D-Generation]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Magda Szubanski (Mondo Things: Cheat Notes, episode 30)|url=http://www.abc.net.au/thingo/txt/s1204560.htm|work=Mondo Things|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]]|accessdate=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Szubanski was part of the team that created the television sketch comedy ''[[Fast Forward (TV series)|Fast Forward]]'' for the [[Seven Network]], in which she played various characters, including Pixie-Anne Wheatley, Chenille from the Institute de Beauté, Wee Mary MacGregor, [[Joan Kirner]], Michelle Grogan and other characters. The character of Lynne Postlethwaite was first performed on the ABC's ''The D-Generation''. It was originally written by John Allsop and Andrew Knight, but from ''Fast Forward'' on Szubanski co-wrote the sketches, and created and co-wrote her characters.

In 1995, she and friends Gina Riley and Jane Turner wrote, performed and produced the first all-female Australian sketch comedy television program; ''Big Girl's Blouse''. When Riley and Turner developed the sketch-characters they had created into the sitcom ''[[Kath &amp; Kim (Australian TV series)|Kath &amp; Kim]]'', Szubanski joined them to play [[Sharon Strzelecki]], a character she had previously created herself.

Her character Sharon "pashed" (Australian slang for vigorous kissing) and "married" Australian cricketing legend Shane Warne. She also "pashed" the late Australian actor Heath Ledger on the red carpet at the AFI awards in 2006 while in the role of Sharon, acting as an assistant stage manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-3285393/Viral-video-late-actor-Heath-Ledger-kissing-squealing-comedian-Magda-Szubanski-red-carpet-resurfaces.html|title=Viral video of Heath Ledger kissing Magda Szubanski resurfaces|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, Szubanski created, wrote, co-produced and starred as Margaret O'Halloran in the ''[[Dogwoman]]'' series of TV films, a detective style show based on the idea an expert "dog-whisperer" who, by treating problem dogs, inadvertently stumbles upon and solves human crimes.

In 2006, she hosted a five-part series on the [[Nine Network]], called ''[[Magda's Funny Bits]]'', which showed "never-before-seen" footage of some of her most famous characters from the comedy show ''Fast Forward''. Branded as "no frills", it attracted insufficient ratings and did not continue. She had a similar short-lived result as host of the [[Network Ten]] clip show ''[[The Spearman Experiment]]'' in 2009.

In 2009, she appeared on ''[[Who Do You Think You Are? (Australian TV series)|Who Do You Think You Are?]]'' where she explored her father's Polish Resistance activities as well as the story of her shell-shocked Irish grandfather and her sculptor ancestor Luigi Isepponi who assisted in making the [[Death mask]] for William Burke, half of the duo Burke and Hare, notorious grave robbers and serial killers.

On 3 September, Szubanski will appear as Jemina Davies-Smythe on ''[[Neighbours]]'' where she will officiate the wedding of characters [[Aaron Brennan]] and [[David Tanaka]], the first gay wedding on Australian television.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nova969.com.au/entertainment/magda-szubanski-has-joined-cast-neighbours&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film===
Szubanski starred in the 1995 film ''[[Babe (film)|Babe]]'' as Esme Hoggett. She reprised her role in the 1998 sequel, ''[[Babe: Pig in the City]]''. She then teamed up again with director/producer George Miller to voice the role of Miss Viola in the animated films ''[[Happy Feet]]'' and ''[[Happy Feet Two]]''.

In 2007, she had a minor role as Mrs. Lonsdale, the housemaid in ''[[The Golden Compass (film)|The Golden Compass]]'' to [[Lyra Belacqua]].

===Author===
In 2015, Szubanski released her award-winning memoir ''Reckoning''. In 2016 Magda’s memoir Reckoning won several awards and beat some of Australia’s top literary authors to win the TBA&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theaustralian.com.au/arts/books/nsw-premiers-literary-awards-szubanski-beats-grenville/news-story/0efbf5cb511d4ac827793798fae96eee|title=Subscribe to The Australian {{!}} Newspaper home delivery, website, iPad, iPhone &amp; Android apps|website=www.theaustralian.com.au|language=en|access-date=2018-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;''. Reckoning'' also won the $40,000 Douglas Stewart Prize for Nonfiction,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/arts/books/nsw-premiers-literary-awards-szubanski-beats-grenville/news-story/0efbf5cb511d4ac827793798fae96eee|title=Subscribe {{!}} theaustralian|website=www.theaustralian.com.au|access-date=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Book of the Year" and "Biography of the Year" at the Australian Book Industry Awards.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;

While the book is nominally an autobiography, it is in large part about her father Zbigniew Szubanski, who was an assassin working for the Polish Resistance during World War 2. ''Reckoning'' deals with the themes of intergenerational trauma, the possible genetic inheritance of traumatic memory and Szubanski's struggles with her own sexuality in the shadow of this legacy.

Reviewer Peter craven in ''The Australian'' said it would "dazzle every kind of reader" and described it as "a riveting, overwhelmingly poignant autobiography by a woman of genius. It is a book about how someone might live with the idea of killing the thing they love. It is a story of love and death and redemption and a daughter's love for her father. It is an extraordinary hymn to the tragic heroism at the heart of ordinary life and the soaring moral scrutiny of womankind. Every library should have it, every school should teach it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/arts/review/magda-szubanskis-memoir-reveals-a-woman-of-substance/news-story/023cf36199ab61155a4f96e631f693f1|title=A woman of substance|date=2 October 2015|access-date=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Ferguson in ''The Sydney Morning Herald'' wrote, "This is documentary writing of the highest order and Szubanski has given life to an incredible war story…Reckoning, this tale of war and suburbia, sexuality and comedy, is likely to be the most popular Australian book of the year. Anyone who doesn't adore Magda Szubanski the clown will be awed by Szubanski the A-grade non-fiction writer. Let's hope the books keep on coming."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/books/m17booksrev2-20151008-gk4e1o.html|title=Book review: In Reckoning,  Magda Szubanski pays homage to her assassin dad|last=Ferguson|first=Richard|date=16 October 2015|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en-US|access-date=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Academy Award Winner and friend Geoffrey Rush launched her book and wrote in ''The Guardian:'' "I was absorbed in preparing for King Lear when I read the book. The classical stature of that particular father-daughter relationship didn't go unnoticed. Magda grew up in the shadow of a difficult reckoning — the summation, the questioning, the Elizabethan sense of settling the bill with one's parents. As she phrases it: her father needed to forget— she needed to remember. The only way forward was back. Her book riffs a major life in a reflective minor key. I've got lost in Joyce's Dublin, Woolf's Bloomsbury, the Bronte Sisters' Yorkshire moors. Now I'm enthralled with Magda Szubanski's Croydon, Australia's own collective sub-conscious suburb, the architecture of which she deftly anoints as Bauhaus's "bastard child"…Reckoning is really a non-fiction novel – and its invitation into Magda's story is infectious."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/oct/15/in-praise-of-magda-szubanski-kath-and-kims-class-clown-and|title=The chameleon comedian who charmed a country: Geoffrey Rush on Magda Szubanski|last=Rush|first=Geoffrey|date=14 October 2015|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Premier's Award judges described ''Reckoning'' as 'warm, clear, wise, funny and deeply intelligent. The amplitude of Szubanski's writing is particularly impressive. Her voice has a light surety, while constantly giving narrative and moral weight to the larger themes of grief, family, migration and finding one's place in the world'."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/books/magda-szubanskis-memoir-reckoning-finds-its-place-in-the-world-of-winners-20160518-goyd8h.html|title=Magda Szubanski's memoir Reckoning finds its place in the world of winners|last=Wyndham|first=Susan|date=20 May 2016|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en-US|access-date=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Musical theatre===
In 2007, Szubanski ventured into musical comedy, taking on the role of William Barfee in the Melbourne Theatre Company production of the hit Broadway musical ''[[The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee]]''. ''Variety'' described her performance as "sensationally good."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2006/legit/reviews/the-25th-annual-putnam-county-spelling-bee-2-1200518790/|title=Review: 'The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee'|last=Kemp|first=Peter H.|date=5 February 2006|newspaper=Variety|language=en-US|access-date=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Australian Stage'' said, "Magda Szubanski as the Eric Cartman-esque William Barfee steals the show."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.australianstage.com.au/reviews/sydney/the-25th-annual-putnam-county-spelling-bee-460.html|title=The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee|website=www.australianstage.com.au|access-date=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, she again participated in some gender-blind casting, taking on the role of pint-sized gangster Big Jule in a major stage production of ''[[Guys and Dolls]]''.

In 2010, she appeared in the first Indigenous Musical film ''[[Bran Nue Dae]]'' as Roadhouse Betty alongside Geoffrey Rush, Ernie Dingo, Missy Higgins and Deborah Mailman. The film was directed by Rachel Perkins, daughter of the Aboriginal activist [[Charles Perkins (Aboriginal activist)|Charlie Perkins]].

In 2012, she again teamed with Rush to appear in the Stephen Sondheim musical ''A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum''.

==Other projects==
In 2004, Szubanski advertised the airline [[Jetstar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Magda has 'it' - People - www.theage.com.au|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/05/30/1085855441271.html|accessdate=26 October 2017|work=www.theage.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Szubanski became a spokesperson for the dieting company [[Jenny Craig]] in November 2008.&lt;ref name="BTJenny"&gt;{{cite news|last=Park|first=Nicky|title=Weight no longer a joke for Magda Szubanski|url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/news/entertainment/weight-no-longer-a-joke-for-magda-szubanski/2008/12/23/1229998517442.html|accessdate=11 March 2014|newspaper=[[Brisbane Times]]|agency=[[Australian Associated Press|AAP]]|date=24 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Szubanski joined Jenny Craig weighing 110&amp;nbsp;kg and had been diagnosed with [[sleep apnoea]].&lt;ref name="BTJenny"/&gt; By July 2009, she had lost 36&amp;nbsp;kg to weigh 85&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Browne|first=Rachel|title=The risks and rewards of celebrity slimmers|url=http://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/diet-and-fitness/the-risks-and-rewards-of-celebrity-slimmers-20091031-hqq6.html|accessdate=11 March 2014|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=1 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; She later regained weight, then was dropped as a spokesperson for Jenny Craig. However, subsequent weight loss led to her being re-signed as their spokesperson. She was later again dropped from Jenny Craig. She was also featured in commercials for Telstra in 2014.

== Charity and activism ==
In her late teens, Szubanski volunteered as a worker in a Women's Refuge in Melbourne's North West region. She eventually became a paid worker.

She is Patron of ''Twenty/10.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who We Are - Patron Magda Szubanski - Twenty10 Inc GLCS NSW|url=http://www.twenty10.org.au/we-are-twenty10/|website=Twenty10 inc GLCS NSW}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey]], Szubanski was interviewed on several TV shows advocating for a "Yes" result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Moran|first1=Rob|title=Magda Szubanski in tears on The Project over marriage equality vote|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/tv-and-radio/magda-szubanski-in-tears-on-the-project-over-marriage-equality-vote-20170823-gy2vih.html|accessdate=24 October 2017|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=24 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
