==Career==
Cullen entered into the public eye in 1987 as a member of musical comedy group [[Corky and the Juice Pigs]]. Corky and the Juice Pigs toured the world, winning awards at the [[Edinburgh Fringe]] &amp; performing at [[Just for Laughs]] in Montreal eight times. The group was also featured on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox's]] ''[[MADtv]]''. They released two comedy albums. The group broke up in 1998, after ten years together.

Following the breakup, Cullen began performing solo, often accompanied by musician [[Dylan Goodhue]]. He wrote and mounted his own one-man show called ''Wood, Cheese and Children'' which went on to become a special in CTV's ''[[Comedy Now!]]'' series and was nominated for a [[Gemini Award]]. Also in 1998, he was in a sketch comedy show in England called ''[[Unnatural Acts (1998 TV Series)|Unnatural Acts]]''.

Cullen has appeared frequently on Canadian television, including [[CBC Television|CBC]]'s ''[[Royal Canadian Air Farce]]'', CTV's ''[[The Associates (Canadian TV series)|The Associates]]'', and [[The Comedy Network]]'s ''Patti'' and ''[[Liocracy]]''.
