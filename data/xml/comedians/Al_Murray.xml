'''Alastair James Hay Murray''' (born 10 May 1968), is an [[England|English]] [[comedian]] and [[TV personality]].

He was listed in ''[[The Observer]]'' as one of the 50 funniest acts in British comedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,11710,1101525,00.html |title=The A-Z of laughter |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=[[Guardian Unlimited]] |accessdate=27 December 2006 |location=London |date=7 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, he was voted the 16th greatest stand-up comic on [[Channel 4]]'s 100 Greatest Stand-Ups.

==Early life and family background==
Murray was born at 44 High Street South, [[Stewkley]], [[Buckinghamshire]], only son of [[Lieutenant Colonel|Lieut-Col.]] Ingram Bernard Hay Murray (a great-great-great-great-grandson of [[John Murray, 3rd Duke of Atholl|John, 3rd Duke of Atholl]], who married [[Charlotte Murray, Duchess of Atholl|Charlotte, Baroness Strange]]), by his wife Juliet Anne Thackeray, ''née'' Ritchie (a great-great-granddaughter of the celebrated novelist [[William Makepeace Thackeray]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/comedy/3663518/Prime-time-gentlemen-please.html |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |title=Prime time gentlemen, please |first=Dominic |last=Cavendish |date=3 March 2007 |accessdate=23 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
His grandfather, the [[Ambassador|former British ambassador]] [[Ralph Murray|Sir Ralph Murray]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/comics/a/604/al_murray |title=Al Murray's Biography |work=[[Chortle (website)|Chortle]] |accessdate=27 December 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070107210356/http://www.chortle.co.uk/comics/a/604/al_murray |archivedate=7 January 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; was from [[Scottish people|Scottish]] aristocracy and married into the Kuenberg family, [[Imperial Count]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thepeerage.com/p2254.htm#i22531 |title=Mauricette Vladimira Marie Reichsgräfin Kuenburg |work=The Peerage.com |date= |accessdate=15 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. His patrilineal great-great-grandfather, [[George Murray (bishop of Rochester)|Dr George Murray]], was [[Bishop of Rochester]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Burke's Peerage}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Edward Leigh|Sir Edward Leigh MP]] is his third cousin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Burke's Peerage |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al Murray is in [[Remainder (law)|remainder]] both to [[Peerage of England|English]] and [[Peerage of Scotland|Scottish]] [[hereditary peerage|peerage titles]], including the [[Baron Strange|barony of Strange]] and the [[Duke of Atholl|dukedom of Atholl]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.debretts.com/shop/peerage-and-baronetage-2015.html |title=Debrett's Peerage &amp; Baronetage |year=2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151113164040/http://www.debretts.com/shop/peerage-and-baronetage-2015.html |archivedate=13 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Murray was educated at [[Bedford School]], where he was head boy,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.lovebedford.co.uk/towncentreguide/history-of-bedford.php |title=Harpurs Trust |work=BedfordBID}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[St Edmund Hall, Oxford]], where he read [[History|Modern History]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.seh.ox.ac.uk/about-college/comedy-writers |title=Comedy Writers |work=St Edmund Hall}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] he performed in the comedy group the [[The Oxford Revue|Oxford Revue]], in a show directed by [[Stewart Lee]], later an Honorary Fellow of St Edmund Hall.&lt;ref name="multiple"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/profiles/al_murray.shtml |title=Al Murray |publisher=BBC |work=BBC Comedy |accessdate=27 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life and campaigning==
[[File:Twitter Joke Trial 1.jpg|thumb|Murray (left) with [[Twitter Joke Trial|Paul Chambers]] (centre) and [[Stephen Fry]] (right) outside the [[Royal Courts of Justice]] in London on 27 June 2012]]

Murray married Amber Hargreaves in 2002. The couple, who have two daughters, Scarlett and Willow, separated in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Irvine |first=Chris |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/3170833/Pub-Landlord-Al-Murray-breaks-up-with-wife.html |title=Al Murray breaks up with wife |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=10 October 2008 |accessdate=15 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murray is a keen [[cricket]] fan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lordstaverners.org/members/middlesex |title=Middlesex |work=Lords Taverners.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was invited to attend a farewell lunch for the [[England cricket team]] before their departure for the [[2013–14 Ashes series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lords.org/news/2013/october/long-room-goodbye-for-englands-ashes-squad/ |title=Long Room goodbye for England's Ashes squad |work=Lords.org |date=24 October 2013 |accessdate=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Murray, together with [[Stephen Fry]], supported [[Twitter Joke Trial|Paul Chambers]]' High Court appeals after Chambers had been arrested for contravening the [[Communications Act 2003]] when a joke [[Twitter|tweet]] was regarded by police as "menacing" and a terrorist threat. An appeal against Chambers' conviction was successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Robin Hood Airport tweet bomb joke man wins case|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-19009344|accessdate=9 September 2012|work=[[BBC News Online]] |date=27 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2014, Murray was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to ''[[The Guardian]]'' expressing their hope that Scotland would vote to remain part of the United Kingdom in September's [[Scottish independence referendum, 2014|referendum on that issue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/aug/07/celebrities-open-letter-scotland-independence-full-text |title=Celebrities' open letter to Scotland – full text and list of signatories |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=7 August 2014 |accessdate=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Murray was awarded an [[honorary degree]] (Hon MA) by the [[University of Bedfordshire]] in 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beds.ac.uk/news/2014/november/honorand-al-murray-praises-university-of-bedfordshire-diversity |title=Honorand Al Murray praises University of Bedfordshire diversity |work=University of Bedfordshire |date=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an honorary Doctor of Social Science (PhD) by the [[University of Wolverhampton]] in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wlv.ac.uk/about-us/news-and-events/latest-news/2017/september-2017/honour-for-comedian-al-murray.php |title=Honour for comedian Al Murray |work=University of wolverhampton |date=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career in entertainment==
Murray started out touring with fellow comedians including [[Harry Hill]] and [[Frank Skinner]]. He won the [[Perrier Award]] at the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] in 1999, after being nominated in 1996, 1997 and 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://perriercomedyawards.com/past.htm |title=Perrier Comedy Awards  |accessdate=27 December 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711140401/http://perriercomedyawards.com/past.htm |archivedate=11 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He started out with an act that involved sound-effect impressions, including guns, animals and a car boot. With this act he supported [[Jim Tavaré]] in Leeds in Winter 1992.

In 1994–95, he was the drummer in the band Evangelista,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; the house band at Stewart Lee's and Simon Munnery's experimental [[Cluub Zarathustra]] in London.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Evangelista were Pat Reid (vocals), Martin Ellis (guitar), Paul Ewart (bass) and Al Murray (drums). Reid and Ellis were at school together in Crosby, Liverpool. Reid was at Oxford with Murray. The line up included different bass players of which Paul Ewart was the longest lasting.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Film maker]] Martin Pickles made a short film about the band in 2002. At this time the lead singer Reid described Murray as "he's still not a household name, but anyone who's into comedy knows who Al Murray is".&lt;ref&gt;Fall Apart: The Evangelista Story (2002), at 1.40. http://www.gmfilm.co.uk/fall_apart.html{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} This comment lead to great audience amusement when the film was screened at Pickles' 45th birthday in London in 2013. Half of the band can be seen in a video by Pickles: https://vimeo.com/77492045 Pickles also produced an Evangelista CD in 2003 featuring Murray. Contrary to the film the press release claimed the band was active 1992-1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Pub Landlord===
Murray's character is an English [[pub]]lican with [[Conservatism in the United Kingdom|conservative]] values and an animosity towards [[Germans]] and the [[French people|French]]; he will challenge the audience to name any [[List of sovereign states|country in the world]] before producing some plausible instance of [[United Kingdom|Britain]] bettering it. The character has a great love for the British 1970s [[rock band]] [[Queen (band)|Queen]], often getting musician(s) on his show to perform one of Queen's tunes in their own style.

The character first appeared in 1994 during the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, in the show "Pub Internationale", with [[Harry Hill]]&lt;ref name="multiple"/&gt; and Matthew Bradstock-Smith (who played "Little Alan" as well as the keyboards in Hill's Edinburgh, radio and TV shows). The show featured the "Pub Band", with Murray playing drums and compering. After trying out a character deemed not to have worked, at the opening show Murray suggested saying that the compere had not made it to the show and that the barman in the venue, the Pleasance Cabaret Bar, had offered to fill in. At the [[Edinburgh Festival]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://edinburghfestival.list.co.uk/event/408504-al-murray-the-pub-landlords-summer-saloon/ |title=Al Murray - The Pub Landlord's Summer Saloon |work=edinburghfestival.list.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murray came up with "The Pub Landlord".&lt;ref&gt;[[Stewart Lee]] discusses whether all of Murray's audience realise the character is satirical in his book {{cite book|title=How I Escaped My Certain Fate |url=http://www.faber.co.uk/catalog/how-i-escaped-my-certain-fate/9780571254804 |publisher=Faber &amp; Faber |location=London |year=2010 |pages=293–294 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029202728/http://www.faber.co.uk/catalog/how-i-escaped-my-certain-fate/9780571254804 |archivedate=29 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Murray made his first television appearances on ''[[Harry Hill (TV series)|Harry Hill]]'' in 1997 playing Harry's big brother Alan ("If it's too hard, I can't understand it!"), and subsequently featured in a short film, ''Pub Fiction.'' He made a brief appearance as the Pub Landlord in Series 2, Episode 6 of [[Lee and Herring]]'s ''[[This Morning with Richard Not Judy]]''. Murray's Pub Landlord theatre show, ''My Gaff, My Rules'' was [[short-list]]ed for an [[Laurence Olivier Award|Olivier Award]] in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://theenvelope.latimes.com/extras/lostmind/year/2001/2001_2002lo.htm |title=2001-2002 26th Laurence Olivier Awards |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=27 December 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061017162031/http://theenvelope.latimes.com/extras/lostmind/year/2001/2001_2002lo.htm |archivedate=17 October 2006 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pub Landlord is central focus of the television series ''[[Time Gentlemen Please]]'', as well as a number of other television appearances, including the ''An Audience with...'' strand. Subsequent theatre tours were: ''...And A Glass of White Wine for the Lady'' (another [[catchphrase]]) and ''Giving it Both Barrels''.

The Pub Landlord has hosted several television programmes including ''[[Fact Hunt]]'', named after the fictional quiz machine of the same name from ''[[Time Gentlemen Please]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2005/03/19/316/pints_mean_prizes |title=Pints mean prizes |work=Chortle |accessdate=12 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[BBC One]] show ''[[Live at the Apollo (TV series)|Live at the Apollo]]'' and [[UKTV]] channel [[Dave (TV channel)|Dave]]'s ''[[Al Murray's Compete for the Meat|Compete for the Meat]]'', which is co-hosted by [[Zöe Salmon]], with voice-overs from [[Jim Rosenthal]]. His [[chat show]] ''[[Al Murray's Happy Hour]]'' began airing 13 January 2007 on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,14934-2498641_3,00.html |title=When Harry met Murray |work=[[Times Online]] |accessdate=7 January 2007 |location=London |first=Philippe |last=Naughton |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show has won a [http://www.britishcomedyawards.com/past-winners/2007.aspx British Comedy Award] for "Best New Entertainment Comedy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The British Comedy Awards Past Winners|url=http://www.britishcomedyawards.com/past-winners/2007.aspx|website=The British Comedy Awards|accessdate=26 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murray was the headliner of a July 2009 episode of ''[[Michael McIntyre's Comedy Roadshow]]'', filmed at the [[Brighton Dome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00lpkb7 |title=Michael McIntyre's Comedy Roadshow |work=BBC One |date=6 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From January 2006, the Pub Landlord filled in for [[Tim Lovejoy]] on [[Virgin Radio]] on Sunday afternoons, broadcasting his final show on 24 December 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.virginradio.co.uk/djs_shows/djs/murray.html |title=Al Murray: Time Gentlemen Please |work=Virgin Radio |accessdate=12 February 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208093623/http://www.virginradio.co.uk/djs_shows/djs/murray.html |archivedate=8 February 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pub Landlord has written four books: ''The Pub Landlord's Book Of British Common Sense, The Pub Landlord's Think Yourself British, The Pub Landlord's Great British Quiz Book'', and ''Let's Re-Great Britain''.

===Other work===
As a teenager, Murray was a drummer in the "big band" at Bedford School,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/oct/28/homes1 |title=What would you save if your house was burning down? |first=Laura |last=Potter |date=28 October 2007 |newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also played [[percussion]] in the Bedfordshire County Youth Orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fbym.org.uk/ensembles/youth-orchestra/ |title=County Youth Orchestra |work=Friends of Bedfordshire Youth Music}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played drums on the music for "The Pub Landlord"  television series and during an appearance on "Happy Hour" by [[Phil Collins]] they performed a [[duet]].

In the series he drove around in a restored [[Willys MB|Willys Jeep]], and interviewed survivors from both sides of the war. In the episode about [[Operation Market Garden]] he parachuted, together with veterans, from an aircraft, to commemorate the battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/entertainment/filmandtv/s/233/233019_landlord_pulls_in_stars.html |title=Landlord pulls in stars |newspaper=[[Manchester Evening News]] |accessdate=12 February 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070125202648/http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/entertainment/filmandtv/s/233/233019_landlord_pulls_in_stars.html |archivedate=25 January 2007 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2005/07/13/777/putting_the_al_in_altitude |title=Putting the Al in altitude |work=Chortle |accessdate=12 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
