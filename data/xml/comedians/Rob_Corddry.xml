'''Robert William Corddry''' (born February 4, 1971) is an American actor and comedian. He is known for his work as a [[correspondent]] on ''[[The Daily Show|The Daily Show with Jon Stewart]]'' (2002–2006) and for his starring role in the comedy film ''[[Hot Tub Time Machine]]'' and supporting roles in comedy films such as ''[[Blades of Glory]]'', ''[[The Heartbreak Kid (2007 film)|The Heartbreak Kid]]'', ''[[Semi-Pro]]'', ''[[Harold &amp; Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay]]'', ''[[What Happens in Vegas]]'', ''[[Warm Bodies (film)|Warm Bodies]]'', ''[[Pain &amp; Gain]]'', ''[[The Way, Way Back]]'', ''[[In a World...]]'', ''[[Sex Tape (film)|Sex Tape]]'', ''[[Office Christmas Party]]'', ''[[How to Be a Latin Lover]]'', and ''[[Dog Days (2018 film)|Dog Days]]''. He is also the creator and star of the [[Adult Swim]] comedy series ''[[Childrens Hospital]]'' and won his first and second [[Primetime Emmy Award|Emmy Awards]] in September 2012 and September 2013. Corddry currently co-stars in the [[HBO]] series ''[[Ballers]]''.

==Early life==
Corddry was born and raised in [[Weymouth, Massachusetts]]. He is the son of Robin (née Sullivan) and Steven Corddry, who was a [[Massachusetts Port Authority]] official.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/magazine/articles/2005/05/01/a_bald_liar/ | work=The Boston Globe | first=Paul | last=Rogers | title=A Bald Liar | date=May 1, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umassmag.com/Fall_2005/Class_Clown_940.html UMass Magazine Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120528062958/http://www.umassmag.com/Fall_2005/Class_Clown_940.html |date=May 28, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the older brother of actor [[Nate Corddry]]. He has a younger sister, Laura Corddry, who is an administrator at [[Southern New Hampshire University]]. Corddry and his brother are both [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scouts]] from Troop 19, located in Weymouth.&lt;ref name="cordddryeagle"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/mar/25/entertainment/la-et-performance25-2010mar25|title=The Performance: Rob Corddry|last=Ordoña|first=Michael|date=March 25, 2010|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=2010-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="corddreagle2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gothamist.com/2010/03/25/rob_cordry_actor.php|title=Rob Corddry, Hot Tub Time Machine|last=Del Signore|first=John|date=March 25, 2010|publisher=Gothamist|accessdate=2010-08-15|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100709051231/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/25/rob_cordry_actor.php|archivedate=July 9, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating from Weymouth North High School (1989), Corddry went to the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]] (1989–93). According to an interview in the UMass Amherst [[alumnus|alumni]] magazine, Corddry initially planned to major in journalism, but he stuck with it for just two days. English became his official major. By his second year, he focused much of his attention on Drama classes and plays including ''[[Torch Song Trilogy]]'', ''[[And Then There Were None|Ten Little Indians]]'', ''[[Cat on a Hot Tin Roof]]'', ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', and ''[[Reckless (play)|Reckless]]''. While at UMass, Corddry pledged the Theta Chapter of [[Theta Chi]] fraternity.

In January 1994, Corddry moved to New York City. His early paying jobs included working as a security guard at [[The Metropolitan Museum of Art]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | title = Anytime with Bob Kushell feat. Rob Corddry | series = [[Anytime with Bob Kushell]] | airdate = 2009-02-12 | season = 1 | number = 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and handing out menus for a [[Mexican cuisine|Mexican]] restaurant. He eventually landed acting jobs, including a year-long tour with the [[National Shakespeare Conservatory|National Shakespeare Company]]. He trained in [[Improvisational theatre|improv]] at the [[Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre]] in New York City, performing regularly as a member of the [[sketch comedy]] group "The Naked Babies" (with [[John Ross Bowie]], [[Brian Huskey]], and [[Seth Morris]]); and he spent two years with the sketch comedy group "Third Rail Comedy". Corddry's first notable television appearances were on [[Comedy Central]]'s ''[[Upright Citizens Brigade]]'' (1998–2000).

==''The Daily Show''==
In Spring 2002, he accepted an audition for ''[[The Daily Show]]''. His pieces for ''The Daily Show'' frequently included references to [[Boston, Massachusetts]], which he considers to be his hometown. On October 4, 2005, his younger brother [[Nate Corddry]] made his first appearance as a ''Daily Show'' [[journalist|correspondent]]. On January 12, 2006, Corddry's wife Sandra appeared with him on a ''Daily Show'' segment; they welcomed their first child, daughter Sloane Sullivan Corddry, on July 3, 2006. On February 9, 2006 Corddry hosted an episode of ''The Daily Show'' due to the absence of [[Jon Stewart]] (jokingly because the show's regular host was "[[Plastic surgery|in the shop]]", but in fact because of the birth of Stewart's second child).{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

On August 15, 2006, Corddry said "I've got like a week and a half left, all bets are off", and then on August 21, 2006, Stewart remarked that Corddry's last day on ''The Daily Show'' would be August 24, 2006. Corddry appeared throughout the week, once filing a report from inside a toilet bowl supposedly on board an aircraft transporting [[John Mark Karr]], and another dressed up in a [[1970s in fashion|1970s fashion]]; Stewart remarked, "It's his last week, and really, we're trying to come up with terrible things for him to have to do."

During that last show on August 24, Corddry aired a self-produced [[tribute]] to his four years on the show, going out, as Stewart said, with a "[[Toilet humour|poop joke]]".

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Stewart: That was a very fitting tribute, Rob. We're gonna miss you on the show.
Corddry: Why thank you, Jon. But wherever I go and whatever I do, there'll always be a part of me here.
Stewart: Wow...that's a really sweet thing to say.
Corddry: No no no, I'm not kidding. It's in the second floor men's room, actually. That's what you get for not giving me a proper send off.
Stewart: You're really gonna go out on a poop joke?
Corddry: I have to stay true to myself, Jon.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Corddry cites Stewart as a profound influence on his comedy, crediting Stewart for teaching him how to focus on an idea in order to find the humor in it, and says that his ''The Daily Show'' pedigree earned him the clout to make ''Childrens Hospital''.&lt;ref&gt;Corddry, Rob (July 27, 2015). "Goodbye, and Goodnight". ''[[TV Guide]]''. p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the projects Corddry worked on after leaving ''The Daily Show'' was ''[[The Winner (TV series)|The Winner]]'', a 2007 TV series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tvsquad.com/category/the-daily-show|title=Television News, Reviews and TV Show Recaps |work=[[The Huffington Post]]|accessdate=February 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corddry has since made appearances on the show, both as a guest and as a correspondent. He was a guest on Jon Stewart's final episode.

==Film roles==
Corddry's played the title character in ''[[Blackballed: The Bobby Dukes Story]]'' (2004) and Mac, [[Ben Stiller]]'s character's best friend in ''[[The Heartbreak Kid (2007 film)|The Heartbreak Kid]]''. He has also made appearances in ''[[Old School (film)|Old School]]'' (2003, credited as Robert Corddry), ''[[Blades of Glory]]'', ''[[Semi-Pro]]'', ''[[I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry]]'', ''[[Failure to Launch]]'' and ''[[The Ten]]''.

He starred as the main character in the [[Fox Broadcasting Network|Fox]] mid-season comedy ''[[The Winner (TV series)|The Winner]]'' from March 4, 2007 until the series' cancellation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/devwatch.aspx?id=winner|title=Shows A-Z - TheFutonCritic.com - The Web's Best Television Resource|work=thefutoncritic.com|accessdate=February 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He described the show to Stuff Magazine as "sort of like a fucked-up ''[[The Wonder Years|Wonder Years]]''."

Corddry has appeared in a ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'' episode entitled "The Seder" as a sex offender who moves into [[Larry David]]'s neighborhood. He also appeared in two episodes of Fox's ''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]]'' as Moses Taylor, an actor who plays "Frank Wrench", an obsessively by-the-books detective on a [[show-within-a-show|fictional television series]] ''Wrench''. Corddry has also done some voice work as Gordon the animated [[Devil]] on [[Cartoon Network]]'s ''Weighty Decisions'' (alongside fellow ''Daily Show'' correspondent [[Ed Helms]]). He also appeared in a commercial for Cartoon Network's ''[[Ed, Edd n Eddy]]'' series. He also appeared in a Cartoon Network promotional ad in 2001 as an anger management therapist to the Townsville Villains of the cartoon series Powerpuff Girls.

Corddry played an important role in proliferating [[Justin Halpern]]'s Twitter account ''[[Shit My Dad Says]]''. An early enthusiast of the quotes made by Halpern's father, Rob tweeted a link to Shit My Dad Says which "jump-started" the phenomenon, helping expose Halpern's Twitter feed to a larger audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1990838,00.html|title=Justin Halpern, Author of Sh*t My Dad Says|last=Webley|first=Kayla|date=May 21, 2010|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate=June 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corddry also has starred in three commercials for the [[Holiday Inn]] in both 2010 and 2011. He appeared in three episodes of ''[[Community (TV series)|Community]]'' playing a lawyer, Alan Connor, an old acquaintance of Jeff Winger, who is also a lawyer.

In August 2011, Corddry appeared on episode 29 of the podcast ''Back to Work'', distributed by the 5by5 podcast network, where he was interviewed by Merlin Mann about his writing and acting career.

In 2012, Corddry began a recurring role on the third season of ''[[Happy Endings (TV series)|Happy Endings]]'', playing "The Car Czar", Jane's new boss at the car dealership.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tvline.com/2012/08/09/happy-endings-rob-corddry/ Happy Endings Casts Rob Corddry in Season 3 – TVLine&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; He also had a recurring role on the short-lived FOX series ''[[Ben and Kate]]'', as Buddy, the boorish owner of the bar where Kate and BJ work, also BJ's on-and-off boyfriend.

As recently as October 2013, Rob appeared again as a recurring guest on ''The Jason Ellis Show''. A talk show featured exclusively on SiriusXm Satellite Radio, Corddry accepted an invitation to host his own show airing on the soon to be launched "Jason Ellis Channel".

Since 2015, he has starred in the [[HBO]] comedy-drama series ''[[Ballers]]''.
