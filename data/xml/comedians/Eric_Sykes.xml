'''Eric Sykes''', [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (4 May 1923 – 4 July 2012) was an English radio, stage, television and film writer, comedian, actor, and director whose performing career spanned more than 50 years. He frequently wrote for and/or performed with many other leading comedy performers and writers of the period, including [[Tony Hancock]], [[Spike Milligan]], [[Tommy Cooper]], [[Peter Sellers]], [[John Antrobus]], and [[Johnny Speight]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/1058088/ |title=Sykes, Eric (1923 – 2012) |publisher=BFI Screenonline}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sykes first came to prominence through his many radio credits as a writer and actor in the 1950s, most notably through his collaboration on ''[[The Goon Show]]'' scripts. He became a TV star in his own right in the early 1960s when he appeared with [[Hattie Jacques]] in several popular [[BBC]] comedy television series.

==Early life==
Sykes was born 4 May 1923&lt;ref name=Birth&gt;{{cite web|title=Birthday's today|url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/archive/2011-5-4.html |work=The Telegraph|accessdate=26 April 2014|date=4 May 2011|quote=Mr Eric Sykes, comedian and writer, 88 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Oldham]], Lancashire; his mother died three weeks after his birth. He was the second child of his parents' marriage; his older brother (by two years) was named Vernon. Sykes's father was a labourer in a [[cotton mill]] and a former [[British Army|army]] [[sergeant]]. When Sykes was two, his father remarried and he gained a [[half-brother]] named John.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sykes|first=Eric|title=If I Don't Write It, Nobody Else Will|year=2005|publisher=Fourth Estate|isbn=0-00-717784-4|pages=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sykes was educated at Ward Street Central School in [[Oldham]]. He joined the [[Royal Air Force]] during the [[Second World War]], qualifying as a wireless operator with the rank of [[leading aircraftman]].

== Career ==
Sykes's entertainment career began during the [[Second World War]] while serving in a [[Ultra|Special Liaison Unit]], when he met and worked with then [[Flight Lieutenant]] [[Bill Fraser]]. Sykes also collaborated with fellow RAF servicemen [[Denis Norden]] and Ron Rich in the production of troop entertainment shows. Whilst preparing for one of these shows in 1945, Sykes, accompanied by Norden and Rich, went to a nearby prison camp in search of stage lighting; the camp turned out to be the [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp]], which had recently been liberated by the Allies. Sykes, Norden and Rich organised a food collection amongst their comrades to feed the starving camp inmates.&lt;ref name=belsen&gt;{{cite news|title=How Denis Norden stumbled upon concentration camp horror|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-33230122|accessdate=8 September 2015|work=BBC News|date=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the war ended Sykes decided to try his luck in London, arriving in the middle of the [[Winter of 1946–1947 in the United Kingdom|coldest winter in living memory (1946–47)]]. He rented lodgings, expecting to find work quickly, but by the end of the first week he was cold, hungry, and penniless. The turning point in his life and career came on the Friday night of his first week in London: he had a chance meeting in the street with Bill Fraser, who was by now featuring in a comedy at the [[Playhouse Theatre]]. Fraser took the impoverished Sykes to the theatre, offered him food and drink, and then asked if Sykes would like to write for him. Sykes began providing scripts for both Fraser and [[Frankie Howerd]] and soon found himself in demand as a comedy writer. Forming a partnership with [[Sid Colin]], he worked on the [[BBC]] radio ventriloquism show ''[[Educating Archie]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Archie Andrews goes under the hammer|url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/newsstory.php/10449/archie-andrews-goes-under-the-hammer|accessdate=24 February 2011|newspaper=[[The Stage]]|date=15 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; which began in 1950, and also ''[[Variety Bandbox]]''. Working on ''Educating Archie'' led to him meeting [[Hattie Jacques]] for the first time.

=== 1950s ===
Sykes had begun to write for television as early as 1948,&lt;ref name="televisionheaven1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.televisionheaven.co.uk/ericsykes.htm |publisher=Television Heaven |title=TV Greats: Eric Sykes}}&lt;/ref&gt; but from the early 1950s Sykes began to make an ultimately successful transition from radio to TV, writing a number of series episodes and one-off shows for the BBC. His credits in this period include ''The Howerd Crowd'' (1952), ''Frankie Howerd's Korean Party'', ''Nuts in May'', and ''The Frankie Howerd Show'', as well as ''The Big Man'' (1954) starring [[Fred Emney]] and [[Edwin Styles]]. Sykes also made his first screen appearance at this time in the army film comedy ''[[Orders Are Orders]]'' (1954), which also featured [[Sid James]], Tony Hancock, Peter Sellers, Bill Fraser, and [[Donald Pleasence]].

Sykes's small office above a grocer's shop at 130 [[Uxbridge Road]], [[Shepherd's Bush]], was shared from around 1953 by Spike Milligan. (Sykes and Milligan later jointly formed [[Associated London Scripts]] (ALS) with [[Galton and Simpson|Ray Galton and Alan Simpson]], a writers' agency which lasted for well over a decade until being effectively dissolved in 1967). Late in 1954, Sykes began collaborating with Spike Milligan on scripts for ''The Goon Show'', easing Milligan's workload. Their first collaborative script was for a ''Goon Show'' special called ''Archie in Goonland'', a crossover between ''The Goon Show'' and ''Educating Archie''. The special was broadcast in June 1954 and featured the regular Goon Show cast ([[Harry Secombe]] was then appearing in both)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Carpenter, Humphrey |title=Spike Milligan: The Biography |publisher=Hodder &amp; Stoughton |year=2003 |page=155 |isbn=0-340-82611-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; plus [[Peter Brough]], his [[Ventriloquism#Ventriloquist Dummies|dummy]] [[Archie Andrews (puppet)|Archie Andrews]] and Hattie Jacques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thegoonshow.co.uk/goonography/series4.html |title=Wilmut's Goonography: Goon Shows – 4th Series |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724085710/http://www.thegoonshow.co.uk/goonography/series4.html |archivedate=24 July 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not a success, however, and neither recording nor the script has survived. Sykes and Milligan are credited as the co-writers of all but the first six of the 26 episodes in Series 5 (1954–55)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thegoonshow.co.uk/goonography/series5.html |title=Wilmut's Goonography: Goon Shows – 5th Series |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724085613/http://www.thegoonshow.co.uk/goonography/series5.html |archivedate=24 July 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and three episodes of Series 6 (1955–56); Sykes also wrote a 15-minute Goon Show Christmas special, ''The Missing Christmas Parcel'', broadcast during the [[Children's Hour]] on 8 December 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thegoonshow.co.uk/goonography/series6.html |title=Wilmut's Goonography: Goon Shows – 6th Series |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103152524/http://www.thegoonshow.co.uk/goonography/series6.html |archivedate=3 January 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955, Sykes wrote and performed in a BBC Christmas spectacular, a spoof pantomime called ''Pantomania'', which featured many well-known BBC personalities of the era; it was directed by [[Ernest Maxin]], who went on to produce some of the most famous comedy routines for [[Morecambe &amp; Wise]]. That same year Sykes signed a contract as scriptwriter and variety show presenter for the newly formed independent television company [[Associated Television|ATV]], while continuing to write and perform for the BBC.&lt;ref name="televisionheaven1"/&gt;

In 1956, Sykes performed, wrote scripts, and acted as script editor for the pioneering [[Associated-Rediffusion|Rediffusion]] TV comedy ''[[The Idiot Weekly, Price 2d]]'', the first attempt to translate the humour of the Goons to television. It starred Peter Sellers, with Sykes, [[Kenneth Connor]], and [[Valentine Dyall]]. During this year he also made his second film appearance, playing a minor role in the [[Max Bygraves]] film ''[[Charley Moon]]'', which also featured Bill Fraser, [[Peter Jones (actor)|Peter Jones]], [[Dennis Price]], and (as a child) [[Jane Asher]]. During 1956–57, Sykes also wrote for and performed in ''[[The Tony Hancock Show]]'', where he again worked with Hattie Jacques.

His next venture for the BBC was a one-hour special, ''Sykes Directs a Dress Rehearsal'', playing a harassed director in a fictional TV studio rehearsal room, just before going live to air. Later that year he wrote and appeared in another all-star spectacular called ''Opening Night'' which celebrated the opening of the 1956 National Radio Show at [[Earl's Court]]. In 1957, he created ''Closing Night'', which closed the 1957 show.

By this time Sykes had developed hearing problems; he subsequently lost most of his hearing, but learned to lip-read and watch other performers say their lines to get his cues. In 1957, he wrote and appeared in an edition of ''Val Parnell's Saturday Spectacular'', the first of two shows in this series that he wrote for Peter Sellers. The first went out under the title of ''Eric Sykes Presents Peter Sellers'', and the second, in 1958, was called ''The Peter Sellers Show''.

In 1959, Sykes wrote and directed the one-off BBC special ''Gala Opening'', with a cast that included [[Stanley Unwin (comedian)|'Professor' Stanley Unwin]] and Hattie Jacques,&lt;ref name="televisionheaven1"/&gt; and played a small supporting role in the [[Tommy Steele]] film ''[[Tommy the Toreador]]''.

=== 1960s ===
At the turn of the decade Eric Sykes and his old friend and colleague [[Hattie Jacques]] co-starred in a new 30-minute BBC TV sitcom, ''[[Sykes and a...]]'', which Sykes created in collaboration with writer [[Johnny Speight]], who had worked with him earlier in the 1950s on the two Tony Hancock series for ITV. The original concept for the new series had Eric living in suburbia with his wife, with simple plots centring on everyday problems, but Sykes soon realised that by changing the house-mate from wife to sister it offered more scope for storylines and allowed either or both to become romantically entangled with other people.&lt;ref name="memorabletv1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.memorabletv.com/halloffame/ericsykes.htm |title=Memorable TV: Eric Sykes |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090925161226/http://www.memorabletv.com/halloffame/ericsykes.htm |archivedate=25 September 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the revised concept, Sykes played a version of his established stage persona, a bumbling, work-shy, accident-prone bachelor called Eric Sykes, who lives at 24 Sebastopol Terrace, [[East Acton]], with his unmarried twin sister Harriet, played by Jacques. The other regular cast members were [[Deryck Guyler]] as local constable Wilfred "Corky" Turnbull and [[Richard Wattis]] as their snobbish, busybody neighbour Charles Brown. Wattis left the show after series 3 and his departure was explained by having Mr Brown emigrating to Australia. Other guests included [[Hugh Lloyd]], [[John Bluthal]], [[Leo McKern]], and [[Arthur Mullard]].

The first series (five episodes, all written by Johnny Speight) premiered on 29 January 1960 and were an immediate hit, establishing 'Eric and Hat' as one of Britain's most popular and enduring comedy partnerships. The second series of six episodes (written from storylines suggested by Speight) were mostly written by Sykes, although he co-wrote one episode each with [[John Antrobus]] and Spike Milligan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.televisionheaven.co.uk/sykes.htm |title=Television Heaven:Sykes and A... |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100104192343/http://www.televisionheaven.co.uk/sykes.htm |archivedate=4 January 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; All subsequent episodes were written solely by Sykes.&lt;ref name="memorabletv1"/&gt;

Nine short seasons of ''Sykes and A...'' were made between 1960 and 1965, ranging between six and nine episodes each, plus a short 1962 special in the BBC's annual ''[[Christmas Night with the Stars]]'' programme, now [[Wiping|lost]]. Twenty-five of the original fifty-nine episodes have survived in the BBC archives. It was during this series that Sykes introduced one of his best known creations, the wordless slapstick routine ''The Plank'', which originally appeared in Episode 2, Series 7 of ''Sykes And A...'', first broadcast on 3 March 1964 under that title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGDUBSMfVMI |title=Sykes and A Plank}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1961 Sykes co-starred with [[Warren Mitchell]] in ''Clicquot et Fils'', a one-off, 30-minute comedy written by Associated London Scripts colleagues Ray Galton and Alan Simpson. This was the premiere episode of a new BBC series ''[[Comedy Playhouse]]'', which became an important proving ground for many successful TV comedy series.

In 1962, Sykes played his first starring film role, being a travelling salesman in the comedy ''[[Village of Daughters]]'', set in an Italian village, but featuring a mostly British cast including [[John Le Mesurier]] (who was at that time married to Hattie Jacques), and [[Roger Delgado]]. This was followed by a supporting role in the [[MGM-British Studios|MGM British]] comedy, ''[[Kill or Cure (1962 film)|Kill or Cure]]'', starring [[Terry-Thomas]] with a cast of British comedy stalwarts including one of the first film appearances by [[Ronnie Barker]]. Both films were made by the same writer-director team behind the popular [[Margaret Rutherford]] ''[[Miss Marple]]'' film, ''[[Murder She Said]]''.

During 1965, Sykes made what proved to be the final series of ''Sykes and A...'' and appearing in three major films. He had a small role in ''[[Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines]]'', joining an all-star cast of British and American TV and film luminaries. The spy spoof ''[[The Liquidator (1965 film)|The Liquidator]]'' was directed by [[Jack Cardiff]] and starred [[Rod Taylor]] with Sykes in a secondary role. His third film of that year was the [[Boulting brothers]]' ''[[Rotten to the Core (film)|Rotten to the Core]]'' starring [[Anton Rodgers]] (who replaced Peter Sellers) with Sykes. Sykes had a minor film role in another spy comedy ''[[The Spy with a Cold Nose]]'' (1966), written by Galton and Simpson.

In 1967, Sykes expanded one of his routines into a 45-minute wordless colour short, ''[[The Plank (1967 film)|The Plank]]'' which features, among others, Sykes, [[Tommy Cooper]], [[Jimmy Edwards]], [[Graham Stark]], Hattie Jacques, and future ''[[The Goodies|Goodies]]'' star [[Bill Oddie]]. (The film was [[The Plank (1979 film)|later remade]] for [[Thames Television]] in 1978.) Also in 1967, Sykes and his old friend Jimmy Edwards started touring with the theatrical farce ''[[Big Bad Mouse]]'' which, while keeping more or less to a script, gave them rein to [[ad lib]] and address the audience. They would return to the production on and off until 1975, touring the UK twice and also taking the show abroad, including to Australia.

Returning to television, Sykes and Jacques appeared in the 1967 special ''Sykes Versus ITV'' with Tommy Cooper and [[Ronnie Brody]]. In 1968, he had a supporting role in an Anglo-American film co-production, the [[Edward Dmytryk]] western ''[[Shalako (film)|Shalako]]'', starring [[Sean Connery]] and [[Brigitte Bardot]].

In 1969, Sykes co-starred with Spike Milligan in the ill-fated television sit-com ''[[Curry and Chips]]'', a satire on racial prejudice created and written by Johnny Speight and made for [[London Weekend Television]]. Milligan, who had grown up in [[British India]], played Kevin O'Grady, a half-Pakistani half-Irish man who comes to work in a British factory and ends up boarding with his ineffectual foreman Arthur Blenkinsop (Sykes), who has to regularly defend Kevin against his racist workmates. The supporting cast included pop singer turned actor [[Kenny Lynch]], [[Geoffrey Hughes]], [[Norman Rossington]], [[Sam Kydd]], Jerrold Wells, and Fanny Carby as Arthur and Kevin's landlady. The series provoked a storm of complaints about its liberal use of racist epithets and bad language (although Sykes refused to swear, as he did throughout his career). It was cancelled on the instruction of the [[Independent Broadcasting Authority]] after a series of six episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.televisionheaven.co.uk/curry.htm |title=Television Heaven: Curry &amp; Chips |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5gekwdLo4?url=http://www.televisionheaven.co.uk/curry.htm |archivedate=10 May 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sykes also made another minor film appearance in 1969 in the comedy ''[[Monte Carlo or Bust!]]'', which was also titled as ''Those Daring Young Men in Their Jaunty Jalopies''.

=== 1970s ===
In 1970, Sykes returned to BBC television with a guest appearance in an episode of ''[[Till Death Us Do Part]]''. This was followed in 1971 by a six-episode series, ''[[Sykes and a Big, Big Show]]'', for the BBC and a special, ''Sykes: With the Lid Off'', for [[Thames Television]].

In 1972, seven years after the cancellation of ''Sykes and A...'', the BBC revived the series under the title ''[[Sykes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.televisionheaven.co.uk/sykes.htm |title=Television Heaven: Sykes and A.../Sykes |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100104192343/http://www.televisionheaven.co.uk/sykes.htm |archivedate=4 January 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sixty-eight colour episodes of ''Sykes'' were made between 1972 and 1979;&lt;ref name="televisionheaven1"/&gt; forty-three of the shows were re-workings of scripts from the 1960s series, which had been recorded in [[monochrome]]. These included a remake of the 1960s episode ''Sykes and a Stranger'', guest-starring Peter Sellers as the stranger, Tommy Grando, in what was to be Sellers’s final TV part. During the 1970s, Sykes and [[Jimmy Edwards]] took part in a performance of ''[[Big Bad Mouse]]'' entertaining Rhodesian troops for [[Ian Smith]], the Prime Minister of [[Rhodesia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Margolis|first=Jonathan|url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/eric-sykes-actor-and-writer-who-overcame-adversity-to-become-a-leading-figure-of-british-comedy-7912538.html|title= Eric Sykes: Actor and writer who overcame adversity to become a leading figure of British comedy |date= 5 July 2012 |work= The Independent |accessdate=21 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Slide|first=Anthony|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=j8xgDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT213|title=Wake Up At The Back There: It's Jimmy Edwards|location=Albany, Georgia, USA|publisher=BearManor Media|year=2018|page=213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, Sykes had a small role as a police sergeant in the [[Douglas Hickox]] thriller ''[[Theatre of Blood]]''.

In 1977, Sykes wrote and starred in another television special, ''Eric Sykes Shows a Few of Our Favourite Things''. He also wrote the script for the 1977 [[Yorkshire Television]] adaptation of ''[[Charley's Aunt]]'' and appeared in the role of Brassett.

The third version of ''[[The Plank (1979 film)|The Plank]]'' was made in 1979 for [[Thames Television|Thames TV]] as a half-hour TV special.

Sykes was the subject of [[Thames Television]]'s ''[[This Is Your Life (UK TV series)|This Is Your Life]]'', broadcast on 25 December 1979.

=== 1980s ===
Sykes wrote and appeared in two [[Thames Television]] specials broadcast during 1980 – ''The Likes of Sykes'' and ''[[Rhubarb Rhubarb]]''. The latter special, a remake of his 1969 short film ''Rhubarb'' which Sykes also directed, featured many of his old friends including Jimmy Edwards, Bob Todd, Charlie Drake, Bill Fraser, [[Roy Kinnear]], [[Beryl Reid]], and [[Norman Rossington]]. It was his last screen appearance with Hattie Jacques. The film employed an idea drawn from the British showbiz tradition in which extras used the word "rhubarb" to simulate low-level background dialogue, which had also been a running joke in ''The Goon Show''. In 1981, Sykes wrote, directed, and starred in the offbeat comedy ''[[If You Go Down in the Woods Today]]'' for Thames, with a cast including Roy Kinnear, [[Fulton Mackay]], and [[George Sewell]].

During 1982, Sykes played the Chief Constable in the slapstick police comedy film ''[[The Boys in Blue]]'', which starred the comedy duo [[Cannon and Ball]], with [[Jon Pertwee]]. For Thames TV that year, he also appeared in and wrote ''The Eric Sykes 1990 Show'' with Tommy Cooper and [[Dandy Nichols]] and ''[[It's Your Move (1982 film)|It's Your Move]]'', a wordless slapstick comedy depicting the travails of a couple ([[Richard Briers]] and [[Sylvia Syms]]) moving into a new home, who hire an accident-prone firm of house removers, headed by Sykes. It featured an all-star cast including Tommy Cooper, [[Bernard Cribbins]], Jimmy Edwards, [[Irene Handl]], [[Bob Todd]], and [[Andrew Sachs]]. Sykes produced one further silent movie for Thames in 1988, ''Mr. H. Is Late'', set at a funeral. In 1984, Sykes played the Genie in the children's film ''[[Gabrielle and the Doodleman]]'', which also featured [[Windsor Davies]] (who would also appear with Sykes in the BBC's ''Gormenghast'' in 2000), Bob Todd, [[Lynsey de Paul]], and [[Gareth Hunt]].

In 1985, he played the [[Mad Hatter]] in the [[ITV Anglia|Anglia Television]] serial adaptation of ''[[Alice in Wonderland]]'', joining an all-star cast that included [[Michael Bentine]], [[Leslie Crowther]], and [[Leonard Rossiter]], and he also had an uncredited role (as an arcade attendant) in the [[Julien Temple]] film musical ''[[Absolute Beginners (film)|Absolute Beginners]]'' (1986) which stars [[Patsy Kensit]].
