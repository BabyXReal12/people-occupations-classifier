'''Loretta Mary Aiken''' (March 19, 1894 – May 23, 1975), known by her stage name '''Jackie''' "'''Moms'''" '''Mabley''', was an American standup [[comedian]]. A veteran of the [[Chitlin' Circuit]] of African-American vaudeville, she later appeared on the ''[[Ed Sullivan Show]]'' and ''[[The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour]]''.&lt;ref name=apobit/&gt;

==Early years==
Loretta Mary Aiken was born in [[Brevard, North Carolina]] on March 19, 1894&lt;ref&gt;{{Year: 1900; Census Place: Brevard, Transylvania, North Carolina; Roll: 1219; Page: 5A; Enumeration District: 0112; FHL microfilm: 1241219; Year: 1910; Census Place: Brevard, Transylvania, North Carolina; Roll: T624_1134; Page: 7A; Enumeration District: 0156; FHL microfilm: 1375147.}}&lt;/ref&gt; to James Aiken and Mary Smith, who married on May 21, 1891, in [[Transylvania County, North Carolina]].&lt;ref&gt;"North Carolina, Marriages, 1759–1979", index, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/F8GW-KPX : accessed November 21, 2013), James Aiken and Mary Smith, May 21, 1891.&lt;/ref&gt; Loretta was one of 16 children.&lt;ref name="NYT87"&gt;Leslie Bennetts, [https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/09/theater/theater-the-pain-behind-the-laughter-of-moms-mabley.html "THEATER; The Pain Behind The Laughter of Moms Mabley"], ''The New York Times'', August 9, 1987; retrieved November 18,2013.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Her father owned and operated several successful businesses, while her mother kept house and took in boarders. While working as a volunteer fireman in 1909, her father died when a fire engine exploded. Loretta was 15 years old at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=104110166|title=James P. "Jim" Aiken (1861-1909)|website=www.findagrave.com|access-date=2017-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT87"/&gt; In 1910, her mother took over their primary business, a general store. She was killed after being run over by a truck while returning home from church on Christmas Day.&lt;ref name="NYT87"/&gt;

By age 14, Loretta had been raped twice (at age 11, by an elderly black man, and age 13, by a white sheriff) and had two children who were given up for adoption.&lt;ref name=writersalmanac&gt;{{cite web|title=Profile|url=http://writersalmanac.publicradio.org/index.php?date=2012/03/19|work=The Writer's Almanac|accessdate=March 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hush, Honey: An Anthology of African American Women's Humor|last=Dance|first=Daryl Cumber|authorlink=Daryl Cumber Dance|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|year=1998|isbn=|location=New York|page=637}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

At the encouragement of her grandmother, Loretta ran away to [[Cleveland|Cleveland, Ohio]], joining a traveling [[vaudeville]]-style [[minstrel show]] starring [[Butterbeans and Susie]], where she sang and entertained.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kliph Nesteroff|title=Moms Mabley - Agitation in Moderation|url=http://blog.wfmu.org/freeform/2007/08/moms-mabley---a.html|work=WFMU's Beware of the Blog|publisher=WFMU-New York|date=August 26, 2007|accessdate=2008-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Loretta Aiken took her stage name, Jackie Mabley, from an early boyfriend, commenting to ''[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]'' in a 1970s interview that he had taken so much from her, it was the least she could do to take his name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Moms Mabley: She Finally Makes the Movies|work=[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]|page=88|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LN4DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA88|quote=But instead of making a name for Loretta Aiken during this time, Moms was taking a name from a man named Jack Mabley. 'Jack was my first boyfriend,' Moms says... 'He took a lot off me and the least I could do was take his name.'|date=April 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later she became known as "Moms" because she was indeed a "Mom" to many other comedians on the circuit in the 1950s and 1960s.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

She came out as a [[lesbian]] at the age of twenty-seven, becoming one of the first openly gay comedians.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Stern. ''Queers in History: The Comprehensive Encyclopedia of Historical'', pg. 295.&lt;!-- publisher, ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1920s and 1930s she appeared in androgynous clothing (as she did in the film version of ''[[The Emperor Jones (1933 film)|The Emperor Jones]]'' with [[Paul Robeson]]) and recorded several of her early "lesbian stand-up" routines.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

Mabley was one of the most successful entertainers of the [[Chitlin' circuit]], another name for [[Theatre Owners Booking Association|T.O.B.A.]], or Theater Owners Booking Association. T.O.B.A., sometimes called the "Tough On Black Asses Circuit", was the segregated organization for which Mabley performed until the organization dissolved during the [[Great Depression]]. Despite Mabley's popularity, wages for black women in show business were meager.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Nonetheless, she persisted for more than sixty years. At the height of her career, she was earning US$10,000 a week at [[Harlem]]'s [[Apollo Theater]]. She made her New York City debut at [[Connie's Inn]] in Harlem.&lt;ref name=eb&gt;{{cite web|title=Moms Mabley|url=http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-9399767|work=Encyclopædia Britannica's Guide to Black History|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.|year=2009|accessdate=2008-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 1960s, she became known to a wider white audience, playing [[Carnegie Hall]] in 1962,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/tv/article/Whoopi-Goldberg-Presents-Moms-Mabley-review-4986351.php|title='Whoopi Goldberg Presents Moms Mabley' review|last=Wiegand|first=David|date=November 15, 2013|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|accessdate=September 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and making a number of mainstream TV appearances, particularly her multiple appearances on ''[[The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour]]'' when that CBS show was number one on television in the late 1960s, which introduced her to a whole new [[Baby Boomer|Boomer]] audience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pics-celeb.com/2010/01/moms-mabley-loretta-mary-aiken-jackie.html Jackie Mabley], pics-celeb.com; retrieved 2010-10-30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0726931|title="The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson" Episode|date=January 21, 1972|work=IMDb|accessdate=February 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Mabley was billed as "The Funniest Woman in the World". She tackled topics too edgy for most mainstream comics of the time, including [[racism]]. One of her regular themes was a romantic interest in handsome young men rather than old "washed-up geezers", and she got away with it courtesy of her stage persona, where she appeared as a toothless, bedraggled woman in a house dress and floppy hat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE3DD1F30F93AA3575BC0A961948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all|title=The Pain Behind The Laughter of Moms Mabley|author=Leslie Bennets|work=The New York Times|date=August 9, 1987|accessdate=2009-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Alden Reimonenq|title=The Harlem Renaissance|url=http://www.glbtq.com/literature/harlem_renaissance.html|work=glbtq Encyclopedia|date=October 9, 2007|accessdate=2008-01-22|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080102095452/http://www.glbtq.com/literature/harlem_renaissance.html|archivedate=January 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

She also added the occasional satirical song to her jokes, and her (completely serious and melancholy) [[cover version]] of "[[Abraham, Martin and John]]" hit #35 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] on July 19, 1969. At 75 years old, Mabley became the oldest living person ever to have a US Top 40 hit ([[Louis Armstrong]], who would have been 86 when "[[What a Wonderful World]]" became a hit in 1988, is the oldest overall, although Armstrong was younger than Mabley when the record was made).{{cn|date=February 2018}}

==Personal life==
Mabley had six children: Bonnie, Christine, Charles, and Yvonne Ailey,&lt;ref name=eb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=M.Cordell Thompson|title=Moms Mabley Leaves $½ Million Estate|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aLEDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA59&amp;dq=Moms+Mabley&amp;as_brr=1&amp;ei=nqd4SdjcKoj-lQS76aQu|work=Jet|date=July 24, 1975|accessdate=2008-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and two given up for adoption when she was a teenager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=|chapter=Moms Mabley Biography|url=http://www.bookrags.com/biography/mabley-moms-1897-1975-sjpc-03|title=St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture|publisher=Thomson Gale|year=2009|accessdate=2009-02-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091016090241/http://www.bookrags.com/biography/mabley-moms-1897-1975-sjpc-03|archivedate=2009-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; She died from heart failure in [[White Plains, New York]] on May 23, 1975.&lt;ref name=apobit&gt;{{cite news|title=Moms Mabley Dies at 77|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=mTRIAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=8gANAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1019,3361364&amp;dq=moms+mabley+died&amp;hl=en|newspaper=[[Associated Press]]|date=May 23, 1975|accessdate=2013-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is interred at [[Ferncliff Cemetery]], [[Hartsdale, New York]].

==Legacy==
Mabley was the inspiration for the character of Grandma Klump in ''[[The Nutty Professor (1996 film)|The Nutty Professor]]''. She is the subject of ''[[Whoopi Goldberg]] Presents Moms Mabley'', a [[documentary film]] which first aired on [[HBO]] on November 18, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/17/arts/television/whoopi-goldbergs-documentary-on-moms-mabley.html?smid=tw-share&amp;_r=0 "The Comedy Pioneer in the Floppy Hat"], ''The New York Times'', November 17, 2013.&lt;br&gt;It is reviewed by Emily Nussbaum in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', November 25, 2013, pp. 128-29.&lt;/ref&gt; 

This documentary was nominated for two [[Creative Arts Emmy Award]]s at the [[66th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards|66th ceremony]] held on August 16, 2014, at the [[Nokia Theatre L.A. Live|Nokia Theatre]] in [[Downtown Los Angeles]]: Outstanding Documentary or Nonfiction Special and [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Narrator|Outstanding Narrator]] for Whoopi Goldberg. In 2015, she was named by Equality Forum as one of their 31 Icons of the 2015 [[LGBT History Month]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Malcolm Lazin|url=http://www.advocate.com/commentary/2015/08/20/op-ed-here-are-31-icons-2015s-gay-history-month|title=Op-ed: Here Are the 31 Icons of 2015's Gay History Month|publisher=Advocate.com|date=August 20, 2015|accessdate=2015-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mabley was featured during the "HerStory" video tribute to notable women on [[U2]]'s tour in 2017 for the 30th anniversary of ''[[The Joshua Tree]]'' during a performance of "Ultraviolet (Light My Way)"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.u2songs.com/news/updated_the_women_of_ultra_violet_light_my_way|title=u2songs - The Women of Ultra Violet: Light My (Mysterious) Ways: Leg 1 -|first=Initial design &amp; architecture by Carl Uebelhart.
