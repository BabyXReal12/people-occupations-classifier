'''Martin Paul Sargent''' (born August 18, 1975) is an American television personality and was co-host of the This WEEK in FUN podcast with Sarah Lane.  He is most well known from his time as a Segment Producer on [[TechTV]]'s ''[[The Screen Savers]]'' and later as the host of his own late night [[talk show]] ''[[Unscrewed with Martin Sargent]]''.

==Early life==
Sargent studied [[History]] and [[English studies|English]] at the [[University of London]], [[Cornell University]] and [[Syracuse University]].

==Career==
Sargent's first job after school was as an editor at PC/Computing magazine.&lt;ref name="About WD"&gt;[http://revision3.com/index.php?show=webdrifter&amp;showpage=about About Web Drifter-Martin Sargent]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, Sargent joined the [[ZDTV]] (later [[TechTV]]) [[television program|TV show]] ''[[Call For Help]]'' as the show's "Resident Craft Professional" and substitute co-host.  In 2001, he moved from ''Call For Help'' to another TechTV show, ''[[The Screen Savers]]'', and became known first as "The Twisted Lister", for producing and presenting odd, "twisted" top-five lists on the show, and later for another segment, "Site of the Night", in which he presented strange [[website]]s.

Sargent left ''The Screen Savers'' in April 2003, to host his own show, ''[[Unscrewed with Martin Sargent]]'', anchoring a newly introduced late-night programming block.

On March 25, 2004, [[Comcast]]'s [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4]] gaming channel announced a merger with TechTV.  This move became hugely controversial among loyal fans of TechTV.  Around May 6, G4 announced the [[Termination (employment)|termination]] of 250 employees from the [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] office by July 10, 2004, allowing approximately 80 to 100 employees to transition to G4's main office in [[Los Angeles, California]] if they agreed to relocate there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://leoville.com/blog/index.php/TLR/comments/comcast_fires_techtv_staff/ Comcast Fires TechTV Staff]&lt;/ref&gt;  Sargent chose to stay with G4 and moved to Los Angeles.

Six months later, on November 11, 2004, [[G4TechTV]] canceled ''Unscrewed'' and [[Termination of employment|terminated]] Sargent, along with many other former co-workers from TechTV.&lt;ref&gt;[http://alexalbrecht.typepad.com/alex/g4techtv/index.html Alex Albrecht's blog about the terminations]&lt;/ref&gt;

Exactly one year after his termination, Sargent launched ''[[Infected by Martin Sargent|Infected]]'', a comedy [[podcast]] distributed by the internet production company [[Revision3]]. Infected was hosted by Sargent and "The Gator" (portrayed by co-writer [[Jay Speiden]], who died in December 2016&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/martinsargent/posts/10157994469655171 Martin Sargent's Facebook post about the death of Jay Speiden]&lt;/ref&gt;), produced by [[Joey Rabier]], and was structured as a conversation between co-hosts and producer, with fake "commercials" for various real and fictional products as well as occasional guest callers. Recurring callers included inventor Alex Chiu as well as the fictional characters Johnny O'Banion (portrayed by co-writer/producer [[Stewart Engesser]]), a Hollywood reporter and former [[Loni Anderson]] paramour, and karate master Rickey Kang (also played by Spieden).  O'Banion and Kang were recurring characters on ''[[Infected by Martin Sargent|Infected]]'', and Rabier acted as a production assistant on the show and also appeared as his "intern" character for selected skits.  The podcast was originally available in audio-only format, then offered an alternative video version consisting of a montage of still photographs relating to the topic discussed and taken at the recording session.  The video version has since been offered in full-motion video.  Infected was canceled in December 2007, after 50 episodes.

Sargent hosted ''Web Drifter''&lt;ref&gt;[http://revision3.com/webdrifter/ Web Drifter website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070103001645/http://revision3.com/webdrifter |date=2007-01-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Internet Superstar on Revision3 and ''Why Today Sucked'', on GoTV Network's "Laugh Riot" channel, available for video-enabled cell phones on the Sprint network.  ''Web Drifter'' began as a pilot originally pitched to [[Comedy Central]], but it was picked up by Revision3 after the cable network passed on the show.&lt;ref name="About WD"/&gt;

On January 30, 2008, the Revision3 website released the first episode of Martin Sargent's new show, ''Internet Superstar''.

As of October 27, 2008 he was made redundant as part of Revision3 layoffs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|user=martinsargent|author=Martin Sargent|number=977886209|date=27 October 2008|title=Sad day Revision3. Internet Superstar canceled, cleaned out my desk. Thank you all for watching. Hope you enjoyed it 1/10 as much as I did.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has reappeared on Revision3 show 'The Digg Reel' twice since he was laid off, once as acting co-host alongside [[Kevin Rose]] while regular host Andrew Bancroft was on vacation. In this appearance he expressed mock-anger that, as part of promotions within the show, other cancelled show '[[Pixel Perfect]]' has been revived, unlike his own shows. He appeared once more on The Digg Reel's 100th episode, in which he jokingly stated that he secretly lived within the walls of the Revision3 building, resulting from his supposed inability to get another job.

Starting February 12, 2009, he and Sarah Lane appeared together in a Podcast on [[Leo Laporte]]'s [[TWiT.tv]] network called ''This Week in Fun''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sarahlane.com/blog/category/this-week-in-fun |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130202101824/http://www.sarahlane.com/blog/category/this-week-in-fun |archivedate=2013-02-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The show aired for just shy of a year before going on hiatus in January 2010, following Martin's employment at [[Goodby, Silverstein &amp; Partners]] in [[San Francisco]].  The show was left on good terms with the TWiT network, though they have made no solid plans of returning to production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sarahlane.com/blog/2010/1/21/this-week-in-fun-hibernatin.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100223003733/http://www.sarahlane.com/blog/2010/1/21/this-week-in-fun-hibernatin.html |archivedate=2010-02-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2009, Martin and long-time associate Molly McDonald became engaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|user=martinsargent|author=Martin Sargent|number=6119661171|date=27 November 2009|title=No, unlike the fact that onions will prevent swine flu, this is not an Internet rumor! @molzy and I are betrothed!}}&lt;/ref&gt;
