During the early years of television comedy from 1950 to 1957, he co-wrote and acted on ''[[Caesar's Hour]]'' and  ''[[Your Show of Shows]]'', starring [[Sid Caesar]]. In the 1960s, Reiner was best known as the creator, producer, writer, and actor on ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]''.&lt;ref name=LuckyLife&gt;Van Dyke, Dick (2012), ''My Lucky Life In and Out of Show Business: A Memoir'', Three Rivers Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=official&gt;Waldron, Vince (1994).

Reiner formed a [[Double act|comedy duo]] with [[Mel Brooks]] in "[[2000 Year Old Man]]" and acted in films such as ''[[The Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Coming]]'' (1966) and the ''[[Ocean's Trilogy]]'' (2001–2007). Reiner has won nine [[Emmy Award]]s&lt;ref name="Awards Search - Television Academy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/awards/nominations/award-search?search_api_views_fulltext=carl+reiner&amp;submit=Search&amp;search_api_views_fulltext_1=&amp;search_api_views_fulltext_3=&amp;search_api_views_fulltext_2=&amp;search_api_views_fulltext_4=&amp;field_nominations_year=1949-01-01+00%3A00%3A00&amp;field_nominations_year_1=2014-01-01+00%3A00%3A00&amp;field_nomination_category=All|title=Awards Search - Television Academy|date=2014-08-16|accessdate=2014-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one [[Grammy Award]] during his career. He is the father of actor and director [[Rob Reiner]], author [[Annie Reiner]], and grandfather to [[Tracy Reiner]].

==Early life==
Reiner was born in [[The Bronx, New York]] on March 20, 1922, the son of Irving (1886–1966), a watchmaker, and Bessie (''née'' Mathias) Reiner (1880–1968).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/78/Carl-Reiner.html|title=Carl Reiner Biography (1922-)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents were [[Jews|Jewish]] immigrants; his father was from [[First Austrian Republic|Austria]] and his mother was from [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]].&lt;ref name="jta"&gt;{{cite news|first=Tugend |last=Tom |date=June 15, 2008 |url=http://www.jta.org/news/article/2008/06/15/108983/carlrobreiner06152008 |work=The Jewish Telegraphic Agency |title=Reiners honored by Israeli film fest |accessdate=July 21, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120924102500/http://www.jta.org/news/article/2008/06/15/108983/carlrobreiner06152008 |archivedate=September 24, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; His older brother Charlie (1918-2001) served in the 9th Division's 37th Infantry at 11 major [[World War II]] battles and had his ashes buried at [[Arlington National Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSwE5vuNjCU |last=Reiner |first=Carl |subjectlink=Carl Reiner |interviewer=[[Norm Macdonald]] |title=Norm Macdonald Live|date=June 3, 2014 |accessdate=June 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2001/film/news/ed-mcmahon-heads-for-times-square-1117797777/|title=Ed McMahon heads for Times Square|date=2001-04-25|accessdate=2013-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; At age 16, Charlie read in the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' about a free dramatic workshop being put on by the [[Works Progress Administration]] and told Carl about it. His uncle Harry Mathias was the first entertainer in his family.&lt;ref&gt;Lynda Gorov (2013) [http://www.momentmag.com/funnyman-carl-reiner/ Funnyman Carl Reiner] Moment Magazine&lt;/ref&gt; He had been working as a machinist repairing sewing machines. He credits Charlie with changing his career plans.&lt;ref&gt;Susan King, ''Los Angeles Times'', Feb 27, (2001) pg. F.5&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military service===
In 1943, Reiner was drafted into the [[United States Army Air Forces|Army Air Forces]] and served during World War II, eventually achieving the rank of [[corporal]]. He initially trained to be a radio operator, but after spending three months in the hospital recovering from [[pneumonia]], he was sent to [[Georgetown University]] for ten months to train as a French interpreter. During language training, he had his first experience as a director, putting on a [[Molière]] play entirely in French. In 1944, after completing language training, he was sent to [[Hawaii]] to work as a [[teleprinter]] operator.  The night before he was to ship out for an unknown assignment, he attended a production of [[Hamlet]] by the [[Special Services (entertainment)|Special Services]] entertainment unit. Following an audition for actor and [[Major]] [[Maurice Evans (actor)|Maurice Evans]], he was transferred to the Special Services. Reiner performed around the Pacific theater, entertaining troops in Hawaii, [[Guam]], [[Saipan]], [[Tinian]], and [[Iwo Jima]] for the next two years. In 1946, he was discharged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |url=https://memory.loc.gov/diglib/vhp/bib/loc.natlib.afc2001001.76156 |last=Reiner |first=Carl |subjectlink=Carl Reiner |interviewer=Bernie Cook |title=Carl Reiner Collection (AFC/2001/001/76156), Veterans History Project, American Folklife Center, Library of Congress|date=October 26, 2011 |accessdate=April 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Reiner performed in several [[Broadway theatre|Broadway musical]]s (including ''[[Inside U.S.A.]]'' and ''[[Alive and Kicking (musical)|Alive and Kicking]]'') and had the lead role in ''[[Call Me Mister]]''. In 1950, he was cast by Max Leibman in [[Sid Caesar]]'s ''[[Your Show of Shows]]'', appearing on air in skits while also working alongside writers, such as [[Mel Brooks]] and [[Neil Simon]]. Reiner also worked on ''[[Caesar's Hour]]'' with Brooks, Simon, [[Larry Gelbart]], [[Mel Tolkin]], Mike Stewart, [[Aaron Ruben]], Sheldon Keller, and Gary Belkin.

Starting in 1960, Reiner teamed with Brooks as a [[Double act|comedy duo]] on ''[[The Steve Allen Show]]''. Their performances on television and stage included Reiner playing the straight man in ''[[2000 Year Old Man]]''. Eventually, the routine expanded into a series of 5 comedy albums and a 1975 animated television special, with the last album in the series winning a [[Grammy Award]] for Spoken Comedy Album.&lt;ref&gt;video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI7wDpBRqjo "The 2000 Year Old Man - Created and Performed by Mel Brooks and Carl Reiner"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=41st Annual Grammy Awards winners|url=http://www.grammy.com/nominees/search?artist=&amp;title=The+2000+Year+Old+Man&amp;year=1998|publisher=National Academy of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences, Inc|accessdate=April 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The act gave Brooks "an identity as a comic performer for the first time," said Reiner.&lt;ref name=Nachman&gt;Nachman, Gerald. ''Seriously Funny:  The Rebel Comedians of the 1950s and 1960s'', Knopf Doubleday (2003) p. 474&lt;/ref&gt; Brooks's biographer, William Holtzman, called their 12-minute act "an ingenious jazz improvisation&amp;nbsp;...",&lt;ref name=Nachman/&gt; while [[Gerald Nachman]] described Reiner's part in guiding the act:
{{quote|The routine relies totally on the team's mental agility and chemistry. It's almost heresy to imagine Brooks performing it with any other straight man. Reiner was a solid straight man to Caesar, but with Brooks he is the second-banana supreme...guiding his partner's churning comic mind.&lt;ref name=Nachman/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DmA81BI6oc|title=2000 Year Old Man Mel Brooks Carl Reiner Hollywood Palace 1966|first=|last=iCandy TV|date=April 24, 2015|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Goldie Hawn Carl Reiner Laugh In 1970.JPG|thumb|left|Reiner with [[Goldie Hawn]] on the set of ''[[Rowan &amp; Martin's Laugh-In]]'' on January 16, 1970]]
In 1959, Reiner developed a television pilot titled ''Head of the Family'', based on his own personal and professional life. However, the network did not like Reiner in the lead role for unknown reasons. In 1961, it was recast and re-titled ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]'' and became an iconic series, making stars of his lead actors [[Dick Van Dyke]] and [[Mary Tyler Moore]]. In addition to writing many of the episodes, Reiner occasionally appeared as temperamental show host Alan Brady. The series ran from 1961 to 1966. In 1966, Reiner co-starred in ''[[The Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Coming]]''.

On ''The Dick Van Dyke Show'', he began his directing career. After the series ended its run, his first film feature was an adaptation of [[Joseph Stein]]'s play ''[[Enter Laughing]]'' (1967), which, in turn, was based on Reiner's semi-autobiographical 1958 novel of the same name. Balancing directing, producing, writing, and acting, Reiner has worked on a wide range of films and television programs. Films from his early directing career included ''[[Where's Poppa?]]'' (1970), ''[[Oh, God! (film)|Oh, God!]]'' (1977), and ''[[The Jerk (film)|The Jerk]]'' (1979).

In one of his memoirs, he writes, "Of all the films I have directed, only ''Where's Poppa?'' is universally acknowledged as a cult classic. A cult classic, as you may know, is a film that was seen by a small minority of the world's film goers, who insist it is one of the greatest, most daring, and innovative moving pictures ever made. Whenever two or more cult members meet, they will quote dialogue from the classic and agree that 'the film was ahead of its time.' To be designated a genuine cult classic, it is of primary importance that the film fail to earn back the cost of making, marketing, and distributing it. ''Where’s Poppa?'' was made in 1969 for a little over $1 million. According to the last distribution statements I saw, it will not break even until it earns another $650,000."&lt;ref&gt;Carl Reiner, ''My Anecdotal Life'' (New York: St. Martin's, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Carl Reiner-1976.jpg|thumb|right|Reiner in 1976]]
Reiner had a large role in the early career of [[Steve Martin]], by directing and co-writing four films for the comedian: ''The Jerk'' in 1979, ''[[Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid]]'' in 1982, ''[[The Man with Two Brains]]'' in 1983, and ''[[All of Me (1984 film)|All of Me]]'' in 1984. Reiner also appeared in both ''The Jerk'' and ''Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid''.

[[File:Carl Reiner.jpg|thumb|left|Reiner at the 41st Emmy Awards on September 17, 1989]]
In 1989, he directed ''[[Bert Rigby, You're a Fool]]''. In 1990, he narrated the Grimm children's story "The Musicians of Bremen" (music by Bernard Rogers) for a CD of classical music for children. In 2000, Reiner was honored with the [[Mark Twain Prize for American Humor]]. A year later, he portrayed Saul Bloom in [[Steven Soderbergh]]'s remake of ''[[Ocean's Eleven (2001 film)|Ocean's Eleven]]'', and later reprised the role in ''[[Ocean's Twelve]]'' (2004) and ''[[Ocean's Thirteen]]'' (2007). From 2004 to 2005, Reiner voiced Sarmoti in ''[[Father of the Pride]]''.

Reiner is the author of several books, including his 2004 memoir ''My Anecdotal Life: A Memoir'' and novels, such as his 2006 novel ''NNNNN: A Novel''. In ''American Film'', he expressed his philosophy on writing comedy: "You have to imagine yourself as not somebody very special, but somebody very ordinary. If you imagine yourself as somebody really normal and if it makes you laugh, it's going to make everybody laugh. If you think of yourself as something very special, you'll end up a pedant and a bore. If you start thinking about what's funny, you won't be funny, actually. It's like walking. How do you walk? If you start thinking about it, you'll trip."

In May 2009, he guest-starred as a clinic patient on the [[Both Sides Now (House)|season finale]] of ''[[House (TV series)|House]]''. Reiner also voiced [[Santa Claus|Santa]] in ''[[Merry Madagascar]]'' and reprised his role in the ''[[The Penguins of Madagascar|Penguins of Madagascar]]'' episode "The All Nighter Before Christmas." In December 2009, he guest-starred as a television producer on ''[[Two and a Half Men]]''.

In June 2010, Reiner guest starred in ''Hot in Cleveland'' as Elka Ostrovsky's date and reprised the role in July. He also made appearances in ''[[The Cleveland Show]]'' as Murray and wrote the story for the episode "[[Your Show of Shows (The Cleveland Show)|Your Show of Shows]]", named after the program that started his career. In October 2013 and January 2014, Reiner reprised his role on ''Two and a Half Men''.

==Personal life==
On December 24, 1943, Reiner married singer [[Estelle Reiner|Estelle Lebost]]. The two were married 64 years until her death in 2008. At the time of the marriage, Reiner was 21 and she was 29. Estelle delivered the line "I'll have what she's having" in the deli scene of their son [[Rob Reiner|Rob]]'s 1989 film ''[[When Harry Met Sally]]''.&lt;ref name=james/&gt; She died on October 25, 2008, at age 94.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-me-reiner29-2008oct29-story.html|title=Estelle Reiner dies at 94; singer-actress had cameo in son's film 'When Harry Met Sally'|first=Los Angeles|last=Times|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
