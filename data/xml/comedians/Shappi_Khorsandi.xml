In 2010, the university awarded her an honorary doctorate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.winchester.ac.uk/newsandevents/Pages/ComedianShappiKhorsanditobehonouredbytheUniversityofWinchester.aspx|title=Comedian Shappi Khorsandi to be honoured by the University of Winchester|publisher= The University of Winchester|date=5 October 2010|accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Khorsandi appeared with her son on ''[[Big Star's Little Star]]''.  Also in 2016, along with numerous other celebrities, Khorsandi toured the UK to support [[Jeremy Corbyn]]'s bid to become [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]].&lt;ref name="jc4pmtour"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jc4pmtour.com/|title=#JC4PM|publisher=jc4pmtour|date=28 July 2015|accessdate=15 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite news |last=Wilkinson|first=Michael|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/Jeremy_Corbyn/12134051/Celebrities-to-tour-Britain-in-Jeremy-Corbyn-For-Prime-Minister-musical-show.html|title=Celebrities to tour Britain in 'Jeremy Corbyn For Prime Minister' musical show|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=1 February 2016|accessdate=15 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''A Beginner's Guide to Acting English''==
The book describes the way in which Khorsandi experienced England as a young girl. The narrative begins with her attending nursery school, The Kings' International Nursery School, with her brother, Peyvand. Throughout the book, she explains the ways in which the Persian language differs from English: "They called me ‘poppet’. Iranians said 'jaan' or 'azizam'." She also expresses pride in how her father took English classes and was praised for his affinity with the written word, though she also felt he was able to be more humorous in [[Persian language|Persian]].

Other themes include her experiences with English food and customs, the war between Iran and Iraq, and the hostilities that she and her family encounter—she notes, for example, having been referred to as a terrorist.
