'''Pamela Helen Stephenson, Lady Connolly'''&lt;!-- do not add "PhD" or even "Dr.", academic titles are not included in Wikipedia intros! ;-) --&gt; (born 4 December 1949) is a New Zealand-born Australian. She is a [[psychologist]], writer and performer who is now a resident in both the United Kingdom and United States. She is best known for her work as an actress and comedian during the 1980s. She has written several books, which include a biography of her husband Sir [[Billy Connolly]], and presented a psychology-based interview show called ''[[Shrink Rap (TV series)|Shrink Rap]]'' on British television.

== Early life ==
{{Section-stub|date=September 2016}}

== Comedy and acting ==
Stephenson had begun acting on television by 1972. She starred during 1973–74 as Julie King in the Australian TV series ''[[Ryan (TV series)|Ryan]]''. After numerous television and film appearances, including as Josephine in the 1977 [[ABC Television|ABC]] production of [[Malcolm Williamson]]'s [[opera]] ''[[The Violins of Saint-Jacques]]'', and Wendy in the 1977 New Avengers episode The angels of death. She had another recurring role as Iris Reade in the UK series ''Funny Man'' (1981). She made a TV comedy sketch show pilot, "Stephenson's Rocket", which was not taken up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Roberts |first=J.F. |date=2012 |title=The True History of the Black Adder |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_ft0EWWSRdEC |location=Britain |publisher=Arrow books |page=90 |isbn=978 0 09956 416 4 |accessdate=8 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among her first appearances in the UK, she joined the live on-stage team at ''[[The Comic Strip]]'' led by [[Rik Mayall]], [[Peter Richardson (British director)|Peter Richardson]] and [[Alexei Sayle]] at the [[Raymond Revuebar]] in Soho. This was not a happy experience, according to an interview she gave in 2014: 'Doing stand-up was like a war with everyone playing this game of "I can be funnier than you". You had to come in like a boxer with lots of chutzpah and try to scare the pants off people. I remember envying Rik and the other boys for being guys, because ''The Comic Strip'' was really hard: I was one of the few women doing it and the audience sounded like they were out for blood, so the boys would take their trousers down on stage and other stuff that I couldn’t possibly do.'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2670610/Billy-joking-dashed-hospital-Pamela-Stephenson-tells-day-thought-husband-Billy-Connelly-die.html "Pamela Stephenson tells of the day she thought her husband Billy Connolly, might die"]. ''Mail Online'', 27 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Probably her most widely recognized television role was in the classic 1980s UK comedy television [[sketch comedy|sketch show]] ''[[Not The Nine O'Clock News]]'', alongside [[Rowan Atkinson]], [[Mel Smith]] and [[Griff Rhys Jones]] (1979–82). Her parodies included [[Kate Bush]] in a song called "Oh England, My Leotard" (referencing "[[Lionheart (Kate Bush album)|Oh England My Lionheart]]"), and [[Olivia Newton-John]] in a song called "Typical bloody typical" (referencing "[[Physical (Olivia Newton-John song)|Physical]]"). She also had a small part in three episodes of the British TV police drama series ''[[The Professionals (TV series)|The Professionals]]''. Her personal contribution as a comedian added to the success of ''Not the Nine O'Clock News'', and led to a collaboration with comedy and satire writers [[Mike Lepine (author)|Mike Lepine]] and [[Mark Leigh]]. This spawned a book, ''How To Be A Complete Bitch'', and a board game. In 1982–83, she starred in the [[West End theatre|West End]] production of [[Joseph Papp]]'s version of ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Theatre Record'', 19 May 1982 to 2 June 1982, p. 278&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shane, Emma. [http://www.qsulis.demon.co.uk/Website_Louise_Gold/The_Pirates_Of_Penzance_Stage.htm ''The Pirates of Penzance'']. Louise Gold website, accessed 13 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

She also featured in the American comedy sketch show ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (SNL) (1984–85) making her the first female SNL cast member born outside North America. Her characters on the show included Angela Bradleigh (''[[Weekend Update]]'' commentator) and celebrity impersonations of [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] (in a fake commercial parodying the singer's "[[Lucky Star (Madonna song)|Lucky Star]]" music video), [[Billy Idol]], [[Debby Douillard]], [[Peggy Ashcroft]], [[Joan Collins]] and [[Cyndi Lauper]].

Stephenson acted in a number of films, including ''[[Private Collection (film)|Private Collection]]'' (1972), ''[[Stand Up, Virgin Soldiers]]'' (1977), ''[[The Comeback (1978 film)|The Comeback]]'' (1978), [[Mel Brooks]]'s ''[[History of the World, Part 1]]'' (1981), ''[[Superman III]]'' (1983), ''[[Bloodbath at the House of Death]]'' (1983), ''[[Finders Keepers (1984 film)|Finders Keepers]]'' (1984), ''[[Scandalous (film)|Scandalous]]'' (1984), ''[[Those Dear Departed|Ghosts Can Do It]]'' (1987), and ''[[Les Patterson Saves the World]]'' (1987).

== Other media appearances ==
In 1993, Stephenson hosted the Australian lifestyle programme ''[[Sex (TV series)|Sex]]''.

In December 2010, Stephenson competed in the eighth series of the BBC1 television show ''[[Strictly Come Dancing]]'', consistently winning praise.

She then reached the final along with [[Matt Baker (television personality)|Matt Baker]] and [[Kara Tointon]].

In late 2004, she sold her house in [[Hollywood]] and spent a year on a sailing cruise around the South Pacific Ocean, following the path of [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] and [[Fanny Vandegrift|Fanny Stevenson]].

Her travels were documented in her book ''Treasure Islands''. The boat she bought was renamed "''Takapuna''" after her birthplace.

A year later, she went on another voyage to discover the fate of an ancestor, a sailing captain who had disappeared in the South Seas. The voyage was the subject of a documentary for Australian television, ''Murder or Mutiny''.
