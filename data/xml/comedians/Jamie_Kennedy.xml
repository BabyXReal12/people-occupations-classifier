'''James Harvey "Jamie" Kennedy''' (born May 25, 1970) is an American stand-up comedian, television producer, screenwriter, and actor, He is best known for playing Randy Meeks in the ''[[Scream (franchise)|Scream]]'' franchise and playing various characters in ''[[The Jamie Kennedy Experiment]]'' on [[The WB]].

==Early life==
Kennedy was born in [[Upper Darby Township, Pennsylvania|Upper Darby Township]], a suburb of [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]. Kennedy was raised [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailytargum.com/2.4987/kennedy-does-stand-up-1.1516586 Kennedy does stand-up] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610161956/http://www.dailytargum.com/2.4987/kennedy-does-stand-up-1.1516586 |date=2011-06-10 }} Dailytargum.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mensmagazineonline.com/jamie_kennedy.asp Jamie Kennedy: Man-Child In The Promised Land | Mens Magazine Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509143758/http://www.mensmagazineonline.com/jamie_kennedy.asp |date=2008-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/news/article.cfm?c_id=6&amp;objectid=10395428|title=A quick word with Jamie Kennedy|publisher=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=August 13, 2006|accessdate=September 9, 2010|first=Rebecca|last=Barry}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended and graduated from [[Monsignor Bonner High School]] in 1988. After high school, Kennedy began his career as a [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]] extra. Meanwhile, he worked on voice impersonations.

==Career==
When Kennedy first arrived in [[Los Angeles]], he became a professional [[Hollywood]] extra. During his first night in L.A., he was reading a [[Joan Rivers]] [[autobiography]] in a diner when the waiter explained to him that he had been in a dozen movies as an extra. Kennedy asked, "If you've been in so many movies, why are you a waiter?" The waiter responded, "I have to keep my day job."{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

After a few years of struggling, Kennedy was unable to find an agent and worked as a host at [[Red Lobster (restaurant)|Red Lobster]]. He auditioned for over 80 commercials and could not book one. He then took a job as a [[telemarketer]], and learned that he had a talent in selling things. Kennedy then thought that if he could sell anything, "why not sell myself?", becoming his own agent.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

Kennedy created a false persona, screen agent "Marty Power", to attract the attention of real agents and managers over the phone, who would later book his performances. He came to prominence in the late 1990s for playing Randy Meeks in the [[Scream (film series)|''Scream'' film series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/interviews/3333303/interview-jamie-kennedy-talks-buddy-hutchins-tremors-5/ |title=Jamie Kennedy Talks ‘Buddy Hutchins’ and ‘Tremors 5′ |publisher=BloodyDisgusting.com |date=2010-04-27 |accessdate=2012-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; His lead role as Tim Avery in ''[[Son of the Mask]]'' earned him a [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actor|Golden Raspberry Award nomination for Worst Actor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://razzies.com/forum/topic668_page1.html |title=2005 RAZZIE Nominees &amp; "Winners" |publisher=Razzies.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120228195941/http://www.razzies.com/forum/topic668_page1.html |archive-date=2012-02-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kennedy formed a production company called Wannabe Producers, alongside Josh Etting,{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} through which he has produced the shows ''[[The Jamie Kennedy Experiment]]'', ''[[Blowin' Up]]'', ''[[The Starlet]]'', and ''[[Living with Fran]]'' created by [[David Garrett (screen writer)|David Garrett]]. Following ''[[Malibu's Most Wanted]]'', in which he both wrote and starred, Kennedy co-wrote the [[MTV]] show ''[[Blowin' Up]]'' (2006) featuring his friend [[Stu Stone]].

Kennedy lent his voice to the videogame ''[[ESPN NFL 2K5]]'' as a celebrity adversary with his own football team, the Upper Darby [[Cheesesteak]]s.  He is also unlockable as a free agent tight end in season mode. His stint as [[Activision]]'s emcee at [[E3 (Electronic Entertainment Expo)|E3]] 2007, however, drew much criticism not only for his ignorance of the industry, but also for performing drunk as he insulted the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sliwinski |first=Alexander |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2007/07/19/watch-activision-alienate-E3-audience-with-jamie-kennedy/ |title=Watch Activision alienate E3 audience with Jamie Kennedy |publisher=Joystiq |date=2007-07-19 |accessdate=2012-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While working on his film ''Malibu's Most Wanted'', Kennedy wrote an autobiography entitled, ''Wannabe: A Hollywood Experiment''. The book chronicles his life in Hollywood as he attempts to become a star. It gives background on his life and family, and quickly dives into his adventures. It tells of such things as Kennedy's living conditions in the Hollywood slums, his dilapidated car, and his kidney issues.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

A performer of [[stand-up comedy]], he is also known for his sketch performances on his television reality show, ''[[The Jamie Kennedy Experiment]]'', which became the [[Warner Brothers Network|WB Network]]'s highest-ranking new show in 2002, but which was cancelled in April 2004 due to falling viewership.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.www.unewsonline.com/media/storage/paper953/news/2006/12/07/Entertainment/Jamie.Kennedy.Yuks.It.Up.Tonight.At.Slu-2527534.shtml Jamie Kennedy review]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Jizzy Entertainment released ''[[Unwashed: The Stand-Up Special]].'' In 2008, Kennedy released the documentary ''[[Heckler (film)|Heckler]],'' about the plight of stand-up comics versus their often-aggressive audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lvrj.com/neon/36992894.html |title=Interview with Kennedy about Heckling |publisher=Lvrj.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, he appeared in ''[[Criminal Minds]]'' as a cannibal satanist serial killer.

From 2008-2010, Kennedy played psychology professor Eli James in the [[CBS]] drama ''[[Ghost Whisperer]]''. From 2009-2013, he was in the TV series, ''[[The Cleveland Show]]'', playing Roberta Tubbs' boyfriend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://industry.visitcalifornia.com/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Press_Releases2&amp;TEMPLATE=/CM/ContentDisplay.cfm&amp;CONTENTID=11439 |title=California's new winter tourism ad to star Jamie Kennedy, Arnold Schwarzenegger |publisher=Industry.visitcalifornia.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081026174212/http://industry.visitcalifornia.com/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Press_Releases2 |archivedate=2008-10-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also stars in the [[Nicktoon]] ''[[Fanboy &amp; Chum Chum]]'' as Kyle, an insecure boy wizard who loathes the fun-loving Fanboy and Chum Chum, but who secretly yearns for their friendship. In April 2010, sources reported that Kennedy would very likely return to the [[Scream (film series)|''Scream'' franchise]] to star in the [[Scream 4|fourth installment]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/19819 |title=Jamie Kennedy, Cinephile, Returning in 'Scream IV' |publisher=Bloody-disgusting.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, according to [[Scream (film series)|''Scream'']] screenwriter [[Kevin Williamson (screenwriter)|Kevin Williamson]], plans were never made for him to rejoin the franchise, attributing the misinformation to a fabrication by Kennedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/37189/jamie-kennedy-not-back-scream-4 |title=Jamie Kennedy NOT Back for Scream 4! |publisher=[[Dread Central]]|date=2010-04-27 |accessdate=2012-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 31, 2012 Kennedy hosted and produced ''[[First Night 2013 with Jamie Kennedy]]'', a [[New Year's Eve]] television special widely considered [[List of television shows considered the worst|one of the worst shows of all time]]. His film ''[[Lost &amp; Found in Armenia]]'', in which he plays an American tourist who ends up in an Armenian village, accused of being a Turkish spy, later opened to select theatres on June 7, 2013.
