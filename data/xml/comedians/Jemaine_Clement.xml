'''Jemaine Clement''' (born 10 January 1974) is a New Zealand singer, comedian, musician, actor, voice actor, director, and writer. With [[Bret McKenzie]], as the comedy duo [[Flight of the Conchords]], he has released several albums and created comedy series for both BBC and HBO. 

He has had featured parts in films such as ''[[Gentlemen Broncos]]'' (2009), ''[[Rio (2011 film)|Rio]]'' (2011), ''[[Men in Black 3]]'' (2012) and ''[[Moana (2016 film)|Moana]]'' (2016). In 2014, he made his feature film directorial debut with the [[Comedy horror|horror comedy]] [[mockumentary]] ''[[What We Do in the Shadows]]'', which he wrote, starred in and directed with [[Taika Waititi]]. He currently portrays Oliver Bird on the [[FX (TV channel)|FX]] series [[Legion (TV series)|Legion]] (2017–).

==Early life==
Jemaine Clement was born on 10 January 1974 in [[Masterton]], New Zealand, and was raised by his [[Māori people|Māori]] mother&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/jemaine-clement,34769/ |title=Interview: Jemaine Clement |date =30 October 2009 |accessdate=30 October 2009 |publisher=[[The A.V. Club]] |last=O'Neal |first=Sean |quote=I'm part Maori. My mum's Maori, and she raised me. }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Wairarapa]] region. He attended [[Makoura College]] in Masterton.  After graduation, he moved to New Zealand's capital [[Wellington]], where he studied drama and film at [[Victoria University of Wellington]]. There he met [[Taika Waititi]] (a.k.a. Taika Cohen) with whom he went on to form [[So You're a Man]] and [[The Humourbeasts]]. In 2004, the Humourbeasts toured New Zealand in a stage show titled ''The Untold Tales of Maui'',&lt;ref name="maui"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/CU0409/S00121.htm |title=Humourbeasts 'Tales Of Maui" Comes to ChCh |publisher=Scoop.co.nz |date=17 September 2004 |accessdate=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; a rework of the traditional Maori legends of [[Māui (Māori mythology)|Māui]]. The duo received New Zealand's highest comedy honour, the [[Billy T Award]].

==Career==

===Music===
Clement and [[Bret McKenzie]] formed [[Flight of the Conchords]] while at Victoria University. They have toured internationally and released four CDs: ''Folk the World Tour'' in 2002, ''The Distant Future'' EP in 2007 (winner of 2008 Grammy for Best Comedy  Album),  ''Flight of the Conchords'' in 2008 and ''I Told You I Was Freaky'' in 2009. In 2005 the Conchords produced ''[[Flight of the Conchords (radio series)|Flight of the Conchords]]'', a six-part comedy radio programme on [[BBC Radio 2]]. They appeared on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'', the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' and ''[[The Late Late Show (CBS TV series)|The Late Late Show]]''. After appearing in 2005 on [[Home Box Office|HBO]]'s ''[[One Night Stand (US TV series)|One Night Stand]]'', the Conchords were offered their own 12-part HBO series ''[[Flight of the Conchords (TV series)|Flight of the Conchords]]'', which was based on their earlier BBC radio series of the same name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/20279 |title=BD Rumor Confirmed: Jemaine Clement Becomes 'Yaz' in 'Men in Black III' |publisher=Bloody-disgusting.com |date= |accessdate=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its first season ran from June to September 2007, and was renewed for a second season, which aired on HBO in the US from January to March 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calgaryherald.com/entertainment/Flight+Conchords+defy+struggling+story/1231180/story.html |title=Story – Entertainment |publisher=Calgary Herald |date= |accessdate=25 May 2010 |df= }}{{dead link|date=May 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In December 2009, the Conchords announced the show would not have a third season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://flightoftheconchords.co.nz/2009/12/december-10th/ |title=10 December |publisher=Flight of the Conchords |date= |accessdate=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film and television===
Clement has appeared in several feature films. His debut was in the [[kung fu]] comedy ''[[Tongan Ninja]]'', directed by New Zealander [[Jason Stutter]]. He has worked with Stutter on two more movies to date: the low budget ghost comedy ''Diagnosis Death'' and the drama ''Predicament'', based on the book by late New Zealand novelist [[Ronald Hugh Morrieson]]. He was also the voice of Swayzak in the [[Toonami]] Shockwave game "Trapped in Hyperspace". Clement also has a role in American comedy ''[[Gentlemen Broncos]]'', directed by ''[[Napoleon Dynamite]]''{{'}}s [[Jared Hess]]. This role landed him a nomination for the [[Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Male]]. Though ''Gentlemen Broncos'' was almost universally panned by critics, some&lt;ref name="avclub"&gt;{{cite web|author=Nathan Rabin|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/gentlemen-broncos,41650/|title=I Watched This On Purpose: Gentlemen Broncos|publisher=avclub.com|date=1 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; singled out Clement's performance for praise. In 2010, he voiced Jerry in ''[[Despicable Me]]'' and appeared in the film ''[[Dinner for Schmucks]]''. In 2011, he voiced Nigel in ''[[Rio (2011 film)|Rio]]'', and in 2012 he appeared as the primary antagonist Boris the Animal in ''[[Men in Black 3]]''. In 2012, Jemaine co-wrote, co-directed, and starred in a vampire mockumentary titled ''[[What We Do in the Shadows]]'' with [[Taika Waititi]]. It premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on 19 January 2014. He also reprised his role as Nigel in ''[[Rio 2]]''.

Clement has starred in television commercials internationally and provided [[voiceover]]s for many others in New Zealand.  On 5 February 2006, [[Outback Steakhouse]] began running a series of television commercials starring Clement during [[Super Bowl XL]] in which Clement pretends to be Australian and feigns an Australian accent. One of the long-running gags of ''Flight of the Conchords'' is the [[Australia-New Zealand relations|traditional rivalry between New Zealand and Australia]] and the differences between their accents. The campaign ended in July 2006.

Clement has been involved in award-winning radio work.  In 1999, Clement was a Radio Awards Winner as writer for ''Trashed'', for [[Channel Z (New Zealand radio station)|Channel Z]], Wellington.&lt;ref name="radioawards1999"&gt;{{cite web|author=Thomas C Hokenson |url=http://radiostationworld.com/locations/new_zealand/radio-awards_1999.asp |title=1999 New England Radio Awards Finalists |publisher=Radiostationworld.com |date=24 April 1999 |accessdate=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, he was given a Special Radio Awards Commendation for ''The Sunglass Store''.&lt;ref name="radioawards2000"&gt;{{cite web|author=Thomas C Hokenson|url=http://radiostationworld.com/locations/new_zealand/radio-awards_2000.asp |title=2000 New Zealand Radio Awards Finalists |publisher=Radiostationworld.com |date= |accessdate=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides his television work on ''Flight of the Conchords'', Clement was a writer and cast member of the television shows ''Skitz'' and ''Tellylaughs'' in New Zealand.&lt;ref name=skitz&gt;{{cite web|title=Skitz |url=http://www.gibson.co.nz/skitz/skitzworld/paddedroom/paddedroom.html |website=gibson.co.nz |publisher=Gibson Group |accessdate=23 July 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225113043/http://www.gibson.co.nz/skitz/skitzworld/paddedroom/paddedroom.html |archivedate=25 February 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tellylaughs&gt;{{cite web|title=Tellylaughs|url=http://www.gibson.co.nz/Television/Comedy/Tellylaughs/TellylaughsCast.html|website=gibson.co.nz|publisher=Gibson Group|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clement, with fellow Conchord member [[Bret McKenzie]], guest starred as a pair of camp counselors in "[[Elementary School Musical (The Simpsons)|Elementary School Musical]]", the season premiere of the [[The Simpsons (season 22)|22nd]] season of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', which aired on 26 September 2010.&lt;ref name="Simpsons"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Gleeful over Glee: Cory Monteith to appear on The Simpsons|author=Strachan, Alex|url=http://www.canada.com/Gleeful+over+Glee+Cory+Monteith+appear+Simpsons/3350970/story.html|publisher=[[Canada.com]]|date=2 August 2010|accessdate=2 August 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111028000202/http://www2.canada.com/gleeful+over+glee+cory+monteith+appear+simpsons/3350970/story.html|archivedate=28 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clement also played the role of a prisoner in a Russian [[gulag]] in the 2014 film ''[[Muppets Most Wanted]]'', a sequel to ''[[The Muppets (film)|The Muppets]]'' (2011).

Clement was featured as one of 2008's "100 Sexiest People" in a special edition of the Australian magazine ''[[Who (magazine)|Who]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/19584 |title=Will Smith Pondering Return in 'Men in Black III' |publisher=Bloody-disgusting.com |date= |accessdate=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fellow Conchord member McKenzie appeared on the same list.

In 2015, Clement voiced a horse in two [[DirecTV]] commercials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Liviu Marica]]|url=http://dailycommercials.com/directv-hannah-davis-riding-her-horse |title=DIRECTV: Hannah Davis Riding Her Horse |publisher=Daily Commercials|date= |accessdate=12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, he voiced a "mind-reading [[fart]]"&lt;ref name=mind&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/07/31/jemaine-clement-rick-and-morty-clip|title=Jemaine Clement voices a 'mind-reading fart' in exclusive ''Rick and Morty'' clip|last=Collis|first=Clark|date=July 30, 2015|work=[[Entertainment Tonight]]|accessdate=September 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; on an episode of the [[Adult Swim]] animated series ''[[Rick and Morty]]'', where he performed the song "Goodbye Moonmen".&lt;ref name=moonmen&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/listen-goodbye-moonmen-rick-and-morty-its-entirety-223518|title=Listen to "Goodbye Moonmen" from ''Rick And Morty'' in its entirety|last=Dean|first=Rob|date=August 7, 2015|work=[[The A.V. Club]]|accessdate=September 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clement also starred in the independent film, ''[[People Places Things]]'', which received positive reviews.

In 2016, Clement lent his voice to Tamatoa, a giant [[coconut crab]], in the [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney animated film]] ''[[Moana (2016 film)|Moana]]'', both in English, and the [[Māori language|Māori]] dub. He based the character's voice on that of [[David Bowie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ew.com/movies/2016/12/20/jemaine-clement-moana-clip/|title=Jemaine Clement gets crabby in musical Moana clip|last=Lawrence|first=Derek|date=December 20, 2016|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=December 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
  
In 2017, Clement played Oliver Bird in the FX TV series ''[[Legion (TV series)|Legion]]''. He also played Sauron in ''[[The Lego Batman Movie]]''.

==Personal life==
In August 2008, Clement married his longtime girlfriend, theatre actress and playwright Miranda Manasiadis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/586546/Sorry-ladies-the-Conchord-has-flown-pics|title=Sorry ladies, the Conchord has flown|date=18 August 2008|accessdate=28 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their son Sophocles Iraia Clement was born in October 2008 in New York City.&lt;ref name="Jemaine Clement Welcomes Son Sophocles Iraia"&gt;{{cite web|author=Scott Wolf, on Scott Wolf Spent Wife's Labor Sobering Up |url=http://celebrity-babies.com/2008/11/04/jemaine-clement-sophocles/ |title=Jemaine Clement Welcomes Son Sophocles Iraia |publisher=Celebrity-babies.com |date=29 March 2010 |accessdate=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
