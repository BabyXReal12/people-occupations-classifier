He has also starred in the films ''[[Cabin Boy (film)|Cabin Boy]]'', ''[[There's Something About Mary]]'', ''[[Scary Movie 2]]'', and ''[[Groundhog Day (film)|Groundhog Day]]''.

==Early life==
Elliott was born in [[New York City]], and is the youngest of five children of Lee (née Peppers), a model and TV director, and [[Bob Elliott (comedian)|Bob Elliott]], who was part of the successful comedy team [[Bob and Ray]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/60/Chris-Elliott.html|title=Chris Elliott Biography|publisher=Filmreference.com|accessdate=March 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brooks.govoffice2.com/index.asp?Type=B_BASIC&amp;SEC=%7B6FD8DCED-2C4D-493E-BFCE-FE09340BA711%7D|title=Brooks Maine – Pilley House Donation – Bangor Daily News Article|publisher=Brooks.govoffice2.com|date=June 3, 2005|accessdate=March 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.nytimes.com/query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage-9E0DEEDD1F3AF93AA15757C0A9649D8B63.html|title=Paid Notice: Deaths ELLIOTT, LEE K|date=April 29, 2012|publisher=|accessdate=October 25, 2017|via=query.nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up on the [[Upper East Side]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Koepp|first=Stephen|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20088901,00.html|title=Off-the-Wall Comedy Lands Chris Elliott on TV, and His Dad, Bob (of Bob and Ray), Is Hooked Too|publisher=[[People.com]]|accessdate=March 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended the [[Eugene O'Neill Theater Center|National Theater Institute at the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center]] in the spring of 1979.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

==Career==
Elliott became known in the mid-to-late 1980s, when he was a writer and performer on ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'', playing an assortment of recurring quirky, oddball characters. His characters on the show included:

* "The Regulator Guy": a parody of ''[[The Terminator]]'' films. The Regulator Guy spoke with a vaguely Germanic accent and claimed to be "from the future". The Regulator Guy segments were usually pre-taped and presented by Letterman as the trailer for an upcoming television series. The font used for the title was similar to the font used for the then-popular American television series ''[[The Equalizer]]''. Chris in fact appeared on an episode of [[The Equalizer]] playing a peeping Tom mildly assaulted by the Equalizer. In the Regulator Guy's only live, on-stage appearance, Elliott, carried by wires, "flew" over the audience via [[jet pack]] onto the ''Late Night'' set. The "jet pack" prop appeared to malfunction, which the Regulator Guy then blamed for ruining his dramatic appearance.
* "The Fugitive Guy": a parody of the TV series ''[[The Fugitive (TV series)|The Fugitive]]''
* "The Panicky Guy": Elliott would pretend to be an audience member, who panics and runs from the studio at the slightest threat of danger (similar to doomed characters in disaster movies). Once in the hallway he would be run over and crushed by an advancing floor waxer, with his hands raised in terror. In one variation, he played a German Panicky Guy in Lederhosen, who was run over by a hand dolly full of cheese wheels.
* "The Guy Under the Seats": a short character-comedy bit followed by Elliott as himself (living under the seats, that is) who eventually becomes angry at Letterman and threatens him with some metaphorically articulated comeuppance in the future and always closing with the line "But until that day, I'm gonna be right here, making your life...a living hell."
* "The Conspiracy Guy": During staged audience "question and answer" sessions with Dave, Elliott would approach the microphone and begin accusing Letterman of various plots and schemes, after which "security" would wrestle Elliott to the ground and drag him out of the studio while Elliott yelled threats to Dave.
* "Marlon Brando": a parody of Brando, whom Elliott portrays as a semi-deranged man who performs a "banana dance" to the tune of [[Alley Cat (song)|"Alley Cat"]].
* "Chris Elliott, Jr.": a spoof of talk-show host [[Morton Downey, Jr.]]
* "A Television Miracle": During one ''Late Night'' special focused on short films, Elliott was the star of a short about himself, alluding that he was actually an animatronic being that was created for the TV show.  The "miracle" was the behind-the-scenes work needed to bring his character to life and others.

In 1986 Elliott starred in the Cinemax special ''FDR: A One Man Show'', a spoof comedy about the life and times of the president. He looked and sounded nothing like the man; he portrayed events from Roosevelt's life that never happened, such as a Japanese bombing of the [[White House]], and his crossing the Potomac in a rowboat. By the end of the show, he had performed [[Gallagher (comedian)|Gallagher's]] shtick of smashing watermelons and other soft fruits on stage.

[[File:Chris Elliott at the 41st Emmy Awards.jpg|thumb|left|Chris Elliott at the [[41st Primetime Emmy Awards|41st Emmy Awards]] in 1989]]

Many of Elliott's early film roles were as a supporting actor in non-[[Comedy film|comedies]] such as [[Michael Mann (director)|Michael Mann]]'s ''[[Manhunter (film)|Manhunter]]'' and [[James Cameron]]'s ''[[The Abyss]]''.

In 1990, Elliott created and starred in his own sitcom, which was called ''[[Get a Life (TV series)|Get a Life]]'', about a 30-year-old paperboy named Chris Peterson who lived at home with his parents. Elliott's real-life father, [[Bob Elliott (comedian)|Bob Elliott]], appeared in the show as Chris' father.  The January 1999 issue of ''[[TV Guide]]'' called the "Zoo Animals on Wheels" episode the 19th funniest TV moment of all time.

In 1993, Elliott teamed up with producer [[Brad Hall (producer)|Brad Hall]] and directed a series of critically acclaimed short films that Elliott showed when appearing on ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]''.

Elliott became a cast member of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in 1994. Also that year, Elliott starred in his first movie—entitled ''[[Cabin Boy]]''—which also featured a short appearance by Elliott's old boss, [[David Letterman]], and was produced by [[Tim Burton]]. He was nominated for a [[Razzie Award]] as Worst New Star.

In 2007 Elliott again began appearing on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' with fellow former Letterman writer Gerard Mulligan. On average, these bits appeared once per month.

His other television credits include the chowder taster on ''Throwdown with Bobby Flay'', airdate 09/02/09, and the voice of [[Dogbert]] on the short-run show ''[[Dilbert (TV series)|Dilbert]]'' for [[UPN]]. He played a [[serial killer]] in the series ''[[Third Watch]]'' in episodes 5, "The Hunter, Hunted," and 6, "Greatest Detectives in the World" from season six. He played the role of Peter in the last three seasons of ''[[Everybody Loves Raymond]]'' and a role in a semi-autobiographical sitcom pilot for [[CBS]], entitled ''You've Reached the Elliotts'', playing a man who tries to balance a modest show business career with his home life. As of 2009, Elliott has played the estranged father of ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]'' character Lily Aldrin, whose relationship has strengthened as the show has progressed. As well as multiple appearances on ''[[The King of Queens]]'', Elliott made guest appearances on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman|Late Show]]'', ''[[That '70s Show]]'' episode "2000 Light Years From Home", and ''[[According to Jim]]''.
Since February 3, 2011, Elliott has starred in the [[Adult Swim]] series ''[[Eagleheart (TV series)|Eagleheart]]'', produced by [[Conan O'Brien]]'s production company, [[Conaco]].

In 2015, he had a guest role on an episode of NBC's ''Law and Order: Special Victims Unit'' and began a starring role as Roland Schitt in ''[[Schitt's Creek]]''.

Elliott was also in an ''[[Avocados from Mexico]]'' commercial in February 2018.

==Author==
Elliott has written three books spoofing history or pseudo-history. ''[[Daddy's Boy: A Son's Shocking Account of Life with a Famous Father]]'' is a comedic fictionalized biography about growing up with his famous father, spoofing [[Christina Crawford]]'s ''[[Mommie Dearest]]''. ''[[The Shroud of the Thwacker]]'' is a historical novel about Elliott's investigation of a [[serial killer]] in 1882 New York City, spoofing London's infamous [[Jack the Ripper]] case. ''[[Into Hot Air]]'' tells the story of Chris climbing [[Mount Everest]] with a group of celebrities tagging along to underwrite the trek as he investigates his Uncle Percy's failed Everest expedition.

==Personal life==
Elliott has been married to Paula Niedert since 1986. Niedert worked as a talent coordinator on ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'' when they met. They have two daughters: [[Abby Elliott|Abby]] and Bridey. Abby was a cast member of ''Saturday Night Live'' from 2008 until 2012, making her the first ''SNL'' cast member to be the child of a past cast member. His father [[Bob Elliott (comedian)|Bob Elliott]], of the popular comedy duo [[Bob &amp; Ray]], co-starred on a ''SNL'' Christmas episode in the [[History of Saturday Night Live (1975–1980)#1978–1979 season|1978–1979]] (fourth) season,&lt;ref name="HR1"&gt;{{Cite news|title='SNL' taps Abby Elliott, Michaela Watkins|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=November 12, 2008|author=Andreeva, Nellie}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT1"&gt;{{Cite news|title=A Professionally Funny Family|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/29/magazine/29Elliott-t.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 24, 2009|author=Zuckerman, Ed}}&lt;/ref&gt; making for three generations of Elliotts on ''SNL''.
