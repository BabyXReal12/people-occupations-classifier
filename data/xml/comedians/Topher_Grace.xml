Grace grew up in [[Darien, Connecticut]], where actress [[Kate Bosworth]] was a middle-school friend; and actress [[Chloë Sevigny]]&amp;mdash;who later appeared with him in high school stage plays&amp;mdash;was sometimes his [[Babysitting|babysitter]].&lt;ref name=usatoday12-21-04&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2004-12-21-topher-grace_x.htm?POE=LIFISVA|work=[[USA Today]]|title=The personification of Grace|first1=William|last1=Keck|date=December 21, 2004|accessdate=May 25, 2010|archivedate=January 19, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150119013618/http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/people/2004-12-21-topher-grace_x.htm|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Grace was cast as [[Eric Forman]] on Fox's ''[[That '70s Show]]'', which debuted in 1998. He played the role until season 7. His character was written out and replaced with a new character named Randy Pearson ([[Josh Meyers (actor)|Josh Meyers]]). Grace made a brief [[guest appearance]] in [[That '70s Finale|the final episode]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywood.com/news/tv/3467005/ashton-kutcher-and-topher-grace-to-return-to-that-70s-show?page=all|title=Ashton Kutcher and Topher Grace to Return to ‘'That '70s Show'’?|work=Hollywood.com|accessdate=May 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://splitsider.com/2011/03/10-sitcoms-that-lost-their-lead-actors-and-kept-going|title=10 Sitcoms that Lost Their Lead Actors and Kept Going| work=Splitsider|accessdate=May 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grace played a [[University-preparatory school|prep school]] student who uses marijuana and introduces his girlfriend to [[Cocaine#Basic|freebasing]] in director [[Steven Soderbergh]]'s 2000 film ''[[Traffic (2000 film)|Traffic]]'', as well as having uncredited [[Cameo appearance|cameos]] as himself in Soderbergh's ''[[Ocean's Eleven (2001 film)|Ocean's Eleven]]'' and its 2004 sequel, ''[[Ocean's Twelve]]''. "The joke is that you're supposed to play the worst version of yourself and I don't think too many people are comfortable with that. I never thought for a second that people were really going to think that's what I was like. I think that people will know that I was faking it in those movies", he told ''Flaunt'' magazine in 2007.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

He planned to cameo in ''[[Ocean's Thirteen]]''. However, due to his role in ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'', he had to abandon these plans. As Grace said, "I was doing reshoots on ''Spider-Man 3''. I was bummed. I actually talked to Steven Soderbergh about that and we had a thing and then I couldn’t do it."&lt;ref&gt;Topel, Fred (April 22, 2007).
