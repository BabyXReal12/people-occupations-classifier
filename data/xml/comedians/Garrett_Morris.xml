'''Garrett Morris''' (born February 1, 1937) is an [[United States|American]] [[comedian]], [[actor]], and [[singer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/1158160-Garrett-Morris|title=Garrett Morris|website=Discogs|language=en|access-date=2018-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was part of the original cast of the [[sketch comedy]] program ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', appearing from 1975 to 1980. Morris also had a role as Junior "Uncle Junior" King on the sitcom ''[[The Jamie Foxx Show]]'', which aired from 1996–2001. Morris had a starring role as Earl Washington on the [[CBS]] sitcom ''[[2 Broke Girls]]'', from 2011–2017. He was also known for his role in the sitcom ''[[Martin (TV series)|Martin]]'' as Stan Winters, from 1992–1995, and the movie “Cooleyhigh”.

==Early life and career==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=October 2016}}
Morris was born on February 1, 1937 in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]]. A church-choir singer from his youth, he trained at the [[Juilliard School of Music]] and graduated from [[Dillard University]] in 1958. Early in his career, he performed with [[The Belafonte Folk Singers]]. He performed in a number of [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[musical theater|musicals]], including ''[[Hallelujah, Baby!]]'' and ''[[Ain't Supposed to Die a Natural Death]]''. In 1965, he worked alongside [[Amiri Baraka]], [[Sun Ra]], [[Albert Ayler]] and [[Sonia Sanchez]] at the [[Black Arts Movement|Black Arts Repertory Theatre/School]] in [[Harlem]]; during this period, the theater was frequently raided and surveilled by the [[New York City Police Department]] and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/my-snl-testimonials-from-cast-members-who-lived-it/?print=1|title=My ‘SNL’: Testimonials From Cast Members Who Lived It|first=Matt|last=Patches|date=21 August 2014|website=Grantland.com|accessdate=17 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://omeka.wustl.edu/omeka/exhibits/show/fbeyes/theatreschool|title=Black Arts Repertory Theatre/School · F.B. Eyes Digital Archive: FBI Files on African American Authors and Literary Institutions Obtained Through the U.S. Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) · WUSTL Digital Gateway Image Collections &amp; Exhibitions|website=Omeka.wustl.edu|accessdate=17 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had a small role as a police sergeant in ''[[The Anderson Tapes]]'' (1971) and was a cast member in the short lived CBS sitcom, ''[[Roll Out]].  ''He also appeared as a high school teacher in the 1975 film ''[[Cooley High]]''.

Morris also lived in [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]], where he worked as a postal carrier.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

==''Saturday Night Live''==
Morris has appeared in numerous television shows and movies since the early 1970s, but is best known as one of the original cast members of [[NBC]]'s ''Saturday Night Live''. Periodically on ''SNL'' he sang classical music: once a [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] [[aria]] when guest-host [[Walter Matthau]] designated him as a "musical guest...in place of the usual crap", and once a [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]] ''[[lied]]'' while the titles on the screen purported to express his colleagues' displeasure at having to accommodate a misguided request by him. In February 1977, he sang Tchaikovsky's ''[[None but the Lonely Heart (Tchaikovsky)|Nur wer die Sehnsucht kennt]]'' barefoot in colorful Caribbean dress while subtitles explained he had just returned from Jamaica where he had picked up a girl by claiming to be [[Harry Belafonte]].

One of Morris's best known characters on ''SNL'' was the Dominican baseball player Chico Escuela. Chico spoke only limited and halting English, so the joke centered on his responding to almost any question with his catch phrase: "Baseball... been berra berra good... to me." Another recurring bit, used in the [[newscast]] segment "[[Weekend Update]]", involved Morris being presented as "President of the New York School for the [[hard of hearing|Hard of Hearing]]" and assisting the newscaster by shouting the main headlines, in a parody of the then-common practice of providing [[sign language]] interpretation in an inset on the screen as an aid to the [[deaf]] viewer. According to the book ''Saturday Night: A Backstage History of Saturday Night Live'', Morris was frequently unhappy during his tenure on ''SNL'' from 1975–1980, and expressed the opinion that he was usually [[Typecasting (acting)|typecast]] in stereotypical roles.&lt;ref name=Backstage/&gt;

[[African-American]] performers who have followed Morris on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' have at times been publicly concerned with experiencing the same fate Morris did. [[Eddie Murphy]], for example, told ''[[TV Guide]]'' in the early 1980s that ''SNL'' producer [[Jean Doumanian]] "had tried to Garrett Morris me."      &lt;ref name=Backstage&gt;Hill and Weingrad, Hill, Doug, and Jeff Weingrad.

==Later life and career==
In 1976, Morris appeared in the movie ''[[Car Wash (film)|Car Wash]]'', playing the role of Slide the bookmaker. In 1983 and 1984, Morris appeared in five episodes of ''[[The Jeffersons]]'', playing a character named Jimmy. He starred in the [[1984 in film|1984]] film ''[[The Census Taker]]'', a [[1984 in film|1984]] [[black comedy]] directed by Bruce R. Cook.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/86893/The-Census-Taker/details|title=The Census Taker (1984)|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=24 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pbp1"&gt;{{cite news|url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=N_QiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Fs0FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1339,1505753|title=Things Are Beginning To Look 'Berry Good' For Garrett Morris|author=Bob Michals|publisher=''[[The Palm Beach Post]]''|date=January 3, 1985|accessdate=May 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1985, he appeared in [[Larry Cohen]]'s [[science fiction]] [[horror film]] ''[[The Stuff]]'', playing cookie magnate "Chocolate Chip Charlie", a parody of [[Famous Amos]]. That year he also guested on ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'' as "Lafayette Duquesne". In 1986, Morris began playing a regular occasional character, "Arnold 'Sporty' James," on the NBC cop drama ''[[Hunter (1984 U.S. TV series)|Hunter]]'', starring [[Fred Dryer]] and [[Stepfanie Kramer]]. Morris appeared in [[Married... with Children]] as Russ, one of Al's poker Buddies, in "The Poker Game", in a 1987 season 1 episode and again in 3rd Season episode "Requiem for a Dead Barber". Garrett Morris continually appeared as "Sporty" on "Hunter" through 1989. He also appeared in the 1992 horror comedy ''[[Severed Ties (film)|Severed Ties]]'' starring [[Oliver Reed]].

In 1994, he was "shot by a would-be mugger," whom he "attempted to fight off," but has made a recovery, as he discussed on the January 14, 2016 episode of [[Marc Maron]]'s podcast, [[WTF with Marc Maron|WTF]]. In a radio interview, he mentioned that the robber who shot him was eventually convicted and incarcerated. In prison, inmates who happened to be fans of Morris teamed up and beat up the robber, in revenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1994-02-25/news/1994056077_1_garrett-morris-laraine-newman-gilda-radner|title=Comedian Garrett Morris shot in Los Angeles holdup attempt|website=Articles.baltimoresun.com|accessdate=17 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the shooting, Morris was starring on ''[[Martin (television)|Martin]]'' as Martin's first boss, Stan Winters. Morris' shooting rendered him temporarily unable to continue in the role; he was written out of the show by having the character become a national [[fugitive]]. The scene where he is about to undergo [[plastic surgery]] was shot on the hospital bed Morris occupied while recuperating from the 1994 assault. He made a final appearance as Stan during the show's third season, walking with a cane due to Morris' real injuries, but Stan's reason was that he had crashed his car during a police chase.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

Morris also had regular roles on ''[[Diff'rent Strokes]]'', ''[[The Jeffersons]]'', ''[[Hill Street Blues]]'', ''[[227 (TV series)|227]]'', and ''[[Roc (TV series)|Roc]]''. He also appeared in an episode of ''[[Who's the Boss]]'', "Sam's Car" (1989), playing the role of Officer Audette. He was a regular cast member on ''[[The Jamie Foxx Show]]'', playing Jamie's uncle, Junior King, for the show's entire run.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

In 1998, Morris appeared as himself in the fourth episode of the fifth season of the TV series, ''[[Space Ghost Coast to Coast]]''. In 2002, Morris made a cameo appearance on an episode of ''Saturday Night Live'' hosted by [[Brittany Murphy]]. In 2006, Morris reprised his role as "Headmaster of the New York School for the Hard of Hearing" in a cameo on the TV series ''[[Family Guy]]'', in the episode "[[Barely Legal (Family Guy)|Barely Legal]]". As of 2006, he continues to perform regularly in films. He also operates and is the host of his own comedy club, The Downtown Comedy Club in downtown Los Angeles. On February 9, 2007, [[Los Angeles]] mayor [[Antonio Villaraigosa]] honored Garrett Morris for his work and contributions to the black community. He declared February 9, 2007 Garrett Morris Day and named The Downtown Comedy Club the official club of Los Angeles. In August 2008, Morris played the role of Reverend Pratt in the family comedy drama film, ''[[The Longshots]]'', starring [[Ice Cube]] and [[Keke Palmer]].

In 2009, Morris appeared in two TV commercials for the [[Nintendo DS]]—one featuring ''[[Mario Kart DS]]'', and the other featuring ''[[Brain Age: Train Your Brain in Minutes a Day!]]''. In 2010, Morris appeared in a television commercial for Miller Lite. The national commercial, titled "PopPop," features Morris alongside actors [[Stacey Dash]] and [[Jason Weaver]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wpgc.cbslocal.com/2010/03/31/new-miller-lite-beer-commercial-starring-garrett-morris-jason-weaver-and-stacey-dash/|title=New Miller Lite Beer Commercial Starring Garrett Morris, Jason Weaver...and Stacey Dash!|date=31 March 2010|website=Wpgc.cbslocal.com|accessdate=17 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commercial takes a light-hearted look at a family relationship with Morris playing the grandfather, PopPop, and Weaver as his grandson. {{as of|2010|alt=Since summer 2010}}, Morris has appeared in an ad for Orbit gum in the United States.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} &lt;!-- Forum is not reliable source - removed http://friendsoftom.com/forum/index.php/topic,7014.msg157073.html?PHPSESSID=la85gqfmtp7rku7vtb1oavd7p7#msg157073 --&gt; In 2011, Morris had a cameo role as a Catholic priest on the episode "Three Boys" on the Showtime series ''[[Shameless (U.S. TV series)|Shameless]]''. He was cast as Earl in the [[CBS]] comedy ''[[2 Broke Girls]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deadline.com/2011/03/scott-porter-to-star-in-cws-hart-of-dixie/|title=Scott Porter To Star In CW's 'Hart Of Dixie', More Actors Board Pilots|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|work=Deadline.com|publisher=Mail.com Media Corp.|accessdate=July 1, 2011|date=March 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which premiered on September 19, 2011. Although during the second season he faced a lawsuit from the Global Agency accusing him of not paying 10% of his income from the show as agreed. However, a rep from the show clearly stated that he has not actually failed to do so.&lt;ref name=cbspremieres&gt;{{cite web|last=Seidman|first=Robert|title=CBS Announces Fall 2011 Premiere Dates|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2011/06/29/cbs-announces-fall-2011-premiere-dates/96883/|work=TV By the Numbers|date=June 29, 2011|accessdate=July 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2015, Morris appeared in a cameo in ''[[Ant-Man (film)|Ant-Man]]'', referencing an old SNL sketch where he played the character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comicbook.com/2015/07/18/ant-mans-most-overlooked-cameo-ant-man-himself/|title=Ant-Man's Most Overlooked Cameo: Ant-Man Himself|author=Russ Burlingame|work=Comicbook.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 11, 2016, Morris and his family appeared on the ABC's game show ''[[Celebrity Family Feud]]'', playing against [[Alfonso Ribeiro]] and Ribeiro's friends.{{cn|date=January 2018}} In 2018, Morris appeared in the NBC show ''[[This Is Us (TV series)|This Is Us]]''.
