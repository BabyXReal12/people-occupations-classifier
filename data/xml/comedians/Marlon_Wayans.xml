'''Marlon Lamont Wayans'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Marlon Wayans: 25 Things You Don't Know About Me | work= usmagazine.com | url=http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/marlon-wayans-25-things-you-dont-know-about-me--2014194 |accessdate=April 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (July 23, 1972) is an American actor, comedian, screenwriter, and film producer, beginning with his role as a pedestrian in ''[[I'm Gonna Git You Sucka]]'' in 1988. He frequently collaborates with his brother [[Shawn Wayans]], as he was on [[The WB]] sitcom ''[[The Wayans Bros.]]'' and in the comedic films ''[[Scary Movie]]'', ''[[Scary Movie 2]]'', ''[[White Chicks]]'', ''[[Little Man (2006 film)|Little Man]]'', and ''[[Dance Flick]]''. However, Wayans had a dramatic role in [[Darren Aronofsky]]'s critically acclaimed ''[[Requiem for a Dream]]'', which saw his departure from the usual comedies.

In 2009, he appeared in ''[[G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra]]''. In 2013, he had a leading role in ''[[A Haunted House]]'' and co-starred in ''[[The Heat (film)|The Heat]]''.

Marlon has partnered with former [[Funny or Die]] [[co-founder]] Randy Adams to create ''[[What the Funny]]'', an online destination for urban comedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/marlon-wayans-launching-urban-funny-574363 |title=Marlon Wayans Launching Urban Funny or Die|publisher=Hollywoodreporter.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whatthefunny.com |title=What The Funny |publisher=What The Funny |date= |accessdate=2014-04-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140402085812/http://www.whatthefunny.com/ |archivedate=April 2, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Marlon created the comedy competition television show, ''[[Funniest Wins]]'', which aired on TBS in June - August 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laughspin.com/2014/05/30/marlon-wayans-tbs-series-funniest-wins-unveils-comedian-competitors/|title=Marlon Wayans’ TBS series ‘Funniest Wins’ unveils comedian competitors|publisher=laughspin.com|date=|accessdate=2014-05-30|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140602085941/http://www.laughspin.com/2014/05/30/marlon-wayans-tbs-series-funniest-wins-unveils-comedian-competitors/|archivedate=June 2, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2014, Marlon and his brothers have been traveling the U.S. with "The Wayans Brothers Tour".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goodblacknews.org/2014/07/21/the-wayans-brothers-kick-off-brand-new-comedy-tour-in-u-s/|title=The Wayans Brothers Kick Off Brand-New Comedy Tour in U.S.|publisher=goodblacknews.org |date= |accessdate=2014-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Wayans wrote, produced and starred in ''[[Fifty Shades of Black]]''. The film is a parody of the 2015 erotic romantic drama film ''[[Fifty Shades of Grey (film)|Fifty Shades of Grey]]''. In 2017, [[NBC]] gave him his own sitcom, ''[[Marlon (TV series)|Marlon]]'', for a 10-episode run. In September 2017, ''Marlon'' got renewed for a second season by [[NBC]], set to premiere in 2018.

==Early life==
Wayans was born in [[New York City]], the son of Elvira Alethia (Green), a homemaker and social worker, and Howell Stouten Wayans, a supermarket manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/weta/finding-your-roots/blog/keenen-ivory-wayans-interactive-family-tree/|title=Keenen Ivory Wayans' Interactive Family Tree - Finding Your Roots - PBS|publisher=|accessdate=November 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His family was involved religiously with [[Jehovah's Witnesses]].&lt;ref&gt;Stein, Joel. (September 11, 2000) [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,997920,00.html Marlon Wayans]. TIME. Retrieved on 2012-04-08.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stated on ''[[Finding Your Roots]]'', January 19, 2016, PBS&lt;/ref&gt; Wayans was raised in the [[public housing|housing projects]] of New York City, the youngest of ten siblings. He is the brother of [[Nadia Wayans|Nadia]], [[Shawn Wayans|Shawn]], [[Keenen Ivory Wayans|Keenen Ivory]], [[Damon Wayans|Damon, Sr.]], [[Dwayne Wayans|Dwayne]], and [[Kim Wayans|Kim]]. Wayans went to [[Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music &amp; Art and Performing Arts]] in New York City, the school made famous in ''[[Fame (1980 film)|Fame]]''. After completing high school, he attended [[Howard University]] in [[Washington, D.C.]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/marlon-wayans-17191548 |title=Marlon Wayans |publisher=Biography.com |date= |accessdate=2016-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Marlon appeared with his siblings on ''[[In Living Color]]'' between 1992 and 1993. From 1995 until 1999, Wayans co-starred in the WB sitcom ''[[The Wayans Bros.]]'' with brother [[Shawn Wayans]]. Wayans was originally considered for the role of [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] in the 1992 film ''[[Batman Returns]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Rabin, Nathan. (February 25, 1998) [http://www.avclub.com/content/node/23240 Marlon Wayans]. The A.V. Club. Retrieved on 2012-04-08.&lt;/ref&gt; however it was felt that the film featured too many characters, so the character was omitted from that film. He was then formally signed for the role in the 1995 sequel ''[[Batman Forever]]'' to play opposite [[Billy Dee Williams]] as [[Two-Face]], but the mid-production change in directors from [[Tim Burton]] to [[Joel Schumacher]] would result in both parts being recast and Wayans being paid out (Williams was not yet signed on, but he received a penalty fee as his contract for ''Batman'' allowed him the option of reprise), for which he still receives some royalty payments to this day. He was replaced by [[Chris O'Donnell]]. He produced the first two films of the ''[[Scary Movie]]'' series, in which he and Shawn were credited writers and co-stars. Those films were released in 2000 and 2001. In 2000 he appeared as Tyrone C. Love in ''[[Requiem for a Dream]]'' and as Snails in ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons (film)|Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]''. That same year he and his brother Shawn hosted the 2000 MTV [[Video Music Awards]]. Wayans produced the [[Nickelodeon]] [[cartoon series]] ''[[Thugaboo]]''.  In 2017, ''[[NBC]]'' gave him his own sitcom, ''[[Marlon (TV series)|Marlon]]'', for a 10-episode run. In September 2017, ''Marlon'' got renewed for a second season by ''[[NBC]]'', set to premiere in 2018.

==Personal life==
Wayans was formerly in a long-term relationship with Angelica Zachary. The two are now divorced. They have two children: Shawn Howell Wayans (born 2002) and Amai Zackary Wayans (born 2000). 

Wayans is a fan of the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] and the [[New York Knicks]]. Wayans was close friends with rapper [[Tupac Shakur]] until his death in 1996.
