==Early life==
Korman, who was of Russian [[Jewish]] descent,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewish-theatre.com/visitor/article_display.aspx?articleID=469 All About Jewish Theatre] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101217210101/http://jewish-theatre.com/visitor/article_display.aspx?articleID=469 |date=2010-12-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was born in [[Chicago]], Illinois, the son of Ellen ([[married and maiden names|née]] Blecher) and Cyril Raymond Korman, a salesman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/62/Harvey-Korman.html|title=Harvey Korman Biography (1927–)|work=filmreference.com|accessdate=26 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ukref1"&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title=Harvey Korman|pages=|publisher=Telegraph|date=2008-06-03|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/2071350/Harvey-Korman.html|accessdate=2008-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served in the [[United States Navy]] during World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2008-05-29-korman-obit_N.htm?csp=34 |title=Carol Burnett Show' veteran Harvey Korman dies at 81 | date=2008-05-29 |work=[[USA Today]] | first=Jim | last=Cheng  |accessdate=2008-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being discharged, he studied at the [[The Theatre School at DePaul University|Goodman School of Drama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boston.com/ae/tv/articles/2008/05/29/carol_burnett_star_harvey_korman_dies_at_81/?page=2 |title=Carol Burnett' star Harvey Korman dies at 81 | date=2008-05-29 |publisher=[[Boston Globe]] | author=Bob Thomas  |accessdate=2008-05-29}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of the [[Peninsula Players]] summer theater program during the 1950, 1957, and 1958 seasons.&lt;ref&gt;Peninsula Players 65th Anniversary Program, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Early years===
Korman's first television role was as a head waiter in ''The Donna Reed Show'' episode, "Decisions, Decisions, Decisions". He appeared as a comically exasperated public relations man in a January 1961 episode of the [[CBS]] drama ''[[Route 66 (TV series)|Route 66]]''. He was seen on numerous television programs after that, including the role of Blake in the 1964 episode "Who Chopped Down the Cherry Tree?" on the [[NBC]] [[medical drama]] ''[[The Eleventh Hour (1962 TV series)|The Eleventh Hour]]'' and a bartender in the 1962 ''[[Perry Mason (TV series)|Perry Mason]]'' episode, "The Case of the Unsuitable Uncle."  He frequently appeared as a supporting player on ''[[The Danny Kaye Show]]'' from 1963 through 1967. He was cast three times, including the role of Dr. Allison in "Who Needs Glasses?" (1962), on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[The Donna Reed Show]]''. He also guest-starred on ''[[Dennis the Menace (1959 TV series)|Dennis the Menace]]'' and on the NBC modern western series ''[[Empire (1962 TV series)|Empire]]''.
 
From 1964 to 1966, he appeared three times in consecutive years on the CBS comedy ''[[The Munsters]]'' starring [[Fred Gwynne]] and [[Yvonne De Carlo]]. During the 1965–1966 season, Korman made regular appearances on ABC's ''[[The Flintstones]]'' as [[The Great Gazoo]] in its final season on network television.

===''The Carol Burnett Show''===

With the 1967 debut of  ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]'', Korman saw his greatest fame. He was nominated for six [[Emmy Award]]s for his decade of work on The Burnett Show and won four times – in 1969, 1971 (for "Outstanding Achievement" by a performer in music or variety), 1972, and 1974. He was also nominated for four [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]]s for the series, winning that award in 1975.

===Other work===

While appearing on ''The Carol Burnett Show'', Korman gained further fame by appearing as the villainous Hedley Lamarr in the 1974 film ''[[Blazing Saddles]]''. He also starred in ''[[High Anxiety]]'' (1977) as Dr. Charles Montague. In 1978 he appeared in the CBS ''[[Star Wars Holiday Special]]'' providing "comedy" in three of the special's variety segments: a cantina skit with [[Bea Arthur]] where he plays a barfly who drinks through a hole in the top of his head, another as Chef Gormaanda, a four-armed parody of [[Julia Child]], and one as a malfunctioning Amorphian android in an instruction video. In 1980 he played Captain Blythe in the [[Walt Disney]] comedy, ''[[Herbie Goes Bananas]]''. In 1981 he played Count de Monet in ''[[History of the World, Part 1]]''. In later years he did voice work for the [[The Flintstones (film)|live-action film ''The Flintstones'']] as well as for the animated ''[[The Secret of NIMH 2: Timmy to the Rescue]]''. He also starred in the short-lived Mel Brooks TV series ''[[The Nutt House]]'', and in his final Mel Brooks film, as the zany Dr. Seward, in ''[[Dracula: Dead and Loving It]]''.

He also reunited with fellow ''Carol Burnett Show'' alumnus [[Tim Conway]], making a guest appearance on Conway{{'}}s 1980–1981 comedy-variety series ''[[The Tim Conway Show (1980 TV series)|The Tim Conway Show]]''. The two later toured the U.S. reprising skits from the show as well as performing new material. A DVD of new comedy sketches by Korman and Conway, ''Together Again'', was released in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Conway-Harvey-Korman-Together-Again/dp/B001DR9NB6|title=Amazon.com: Tim Conway Harvey Korman Together Again DVD: Tim Conway, Harvey Korman, Louise DuArt, Pasquale Murena: Movies &amp; TV|work=amazon.com|accessdate=26 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Korman and Conway had been jointly inducted into the [[Television Hall of Fame]] in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/awards/hall-of-fame-honorees|title=Television Hall of Fame Honorees: Complete List}}&lt;/ref&gt;
