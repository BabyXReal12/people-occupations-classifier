'''Ryan Lee Stiles''' (born April 22, 1959) is a Canadian-American [[actor]], [[comedian]], [[Television producer|producer]] and [[Television director|director]] whose work is often associated with [[improvisational comedy]]. He is best known for his career and co-production work on the [[Whose Line Is It Anyway? (U.S. TV series)|American]] and [[Whose Line Is It Anyway? (UK TV series)|British]] versions of ''Whose Line Is It Anyway?'' and the role of [[Lewis Kiniski]] on ''[[The Drew Carey Show]]''. He played [[Herb Melnick#Herb Melnick|Herb Melnick]] on the [[CBS]] comedy ''[[Two and a Half Men]]'' and was a performer on the show ''[[Drew Carey's Improv-A-Ganza]]''.

==Early life and career==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=September 2013}}
The youngest of five children, Ryan Stiles was born in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], to Canadian parents, Irene and Sonny Stiles. He grew up with his mother, a homemaker, and his father, a supervisor at a Vancouver-based Canadian [[fish processing]] plant. When he was 10, his family moved to [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]]. Ryan Stiles attended R.C. Palmer Junior Secondary School and Richmond Senior Secondary in [[Richmond, British Columbia]]. Although he was a good student, Stiles has admitted that "being a high-school senior gave [him] too much freedom." He got so carried away with his flexible schedule that at age 17, he quit school a few months shy of graduation.

Despite his parents' objections, he was able to support himself doing [[Stand-up comedy|stand-up]] routines at clubs near his home in Vancouver. He helped Rich Elwood start Punchlines Comedy Club. During this time he was the head writer of ''[[Don Harron|The Don Harron Show]]'' on [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] and the host of ''Comedy College'' on [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]. Ryan was a regular improv performer with the Vancouver Theatresports League and Punchline's "No Name Player" before joining the [[The Second City|Second City]] comedy ensemble at [[Expo 86]]. He continued with Second City in [[Toronto]] and later in [[Los Angeles]].

==''Whose Line Is It Anyway?'' and ''The Drew Carey Show''==
By 1989, Stiles had gained the attention of the producers of the British improvisational comedy show ''[[Whose Line Is It Anyway? (UK TV series)|Whose Line Is It Anyway?]]''. Stiles was a regular on the show until its end in 1998. His performance on the program earned him both critical praise and a devoted fan following in the United Kingdom. In 1995, Stiles was asked by American comic [[Drew Carey]] to be a regular on his comedy ''The Drew Carey Show''. Stiles played Drew's erudite but underachieving best friend, Lewis Kiniski.

In 1998, Carey successfully lobbied ABC to get an [[Whose Line Is It Anyway? (U.S. TV series)|American version of ''Whose Line Is It Anyway?'']] produced. Following the final season of the British version in 1998, the American version premiered, with both Stiles and Carey credited as executive producers. Stiles and [[Colin Mochrie]] were the only two performers to appear in every episode of the US version, although [[Wayne Brady]] also became a regular near the beginning of the second season. The series was produced until 2006. Stiles received a nomination for a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program]] in 2002 for his work on the show.

Though he never appeared in the series, Stiles (along with Kaitlin Olson) performed in the taping of the unaired pilot episode of ''[[Drew Carey's Green Screen Show]]'', which involved improv games similar to ''Whose Line?'' games played in front of a massive green screen. Animation was later added to the improv footage.

Stiles returned as performer and executive producer for the revival of ''Whose Line Is It Anyway?'' in the summer of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ng|first=Philiana|title='Whose Line Is It Anyway?'

==Other television and film work==
{{more citations needed|section|date=November 2017}}
Stiles appeared in the 1991 film ''[[Hot Shots!]]'' as Mailman Farnham, and also starred in the 1993 sequel ''[[Hot Shots! Part Deux]]'', as marine Rabinowitz. He portrayed recurring character Dr. Herb Melnick on ''[[Two and a Half Men]]'' from 2004 until the show's end in 2015. He made short guest appearances on ''[[Murphy Brown]]'', ''[[Mad About You]]'', ''[[Mad TV]]'', and ''[[Dharma &amp; Greg]]''. In July 2008, he was a guest star on ''[[Reno 911!]]'' as Sergeant Clift, an acting coach.

During the [[1994 Major League Baseball strike]], Stiles appeared in several commercials for [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], hanging out in an empty ballpark, doing things such as playing the organ and attempting to do the wave alone. The commercials ended with the line: "Play ball. Please."

In 2005, Stiles appeared in the [[mockumentary]] ''Conker: Celebrity Squirrel'' produced for the promotion of the [[Xbox]] video game ''[[Conker: Live &amp; Reloaded]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ia-nqTV0Hs|title=Conker: Celebrity Squirrel|date=November 9, 2006|accessdate=December 26, 2015|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; This role led to gamers voting to induct him into the 2015 class of the DK Vine Hall of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoowcvGIYmw|title=DK Vine Hall of Fame 2015 (Part Five)|date=August 10, 2015|accessdate=December 26, 2015|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Charity work ==
Stiles has been a frequent fund raiser for children with burn injuries, raising over $500,000 for the Burned Children Recovery Center since 2009, helping the foundation to recover from the "economy crash of 2008."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.burnedchildrenrecovery.org/ryan-stiles-fundraising|title=Burned Children Recovery Foundation|work=Burned Children Recovery Foundation|accessdate=December 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
In 1981, Stiles met Patricia McDonald at Punchlines where she was a waitress. They married in 1988. They have three children: Sam, Mackenzie, and Claire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.canada.com/nanaimodailynews/story.html?id=b5eb0f39-779d-4a18-a402-eefe2d224d6f |title = Iconic actor likes to stay close to home |last = Spalding |first = Derek |work = [[Nanaimo Daily News]] |publisher = [[CanWest]] |date = May 8, 2008 |accessdate = 2012-06-22 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140326053415/http://www.canada.com/nanaimodailynews/story.html?id=b5eb0f39-779d-4a18-a402-eefe2d224d6f |archivedate = March 26, 2014 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; When not working, he lives at his home on [[Lake Samish]], outside [[Bellingham, Washington]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Saint|last= Bryan|title= Ryan Stiles, back home again|url= http://www.king5.com/sharedcontent/northwest/eveningmagazine/stories/NW_032306EMryanstilesKC.547e80d4.html|work= Evening Magazine|publisher= [[KING-TV]]|location= [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]]|date= 2006-03-24|accessdate=2008-07-27 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080526023650/http://www.king5.com/sharedcontent/northwest/eveningmagazine/stories/NW_032306EMryanstilesKC.547e80d4.html |archivedate = 2008-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he has opened the Upfront Theatre, a small theatre dedicated to live [[Improvisational theatre|improv comedy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Ian|last= Chant|title= Shooting From the Hip&amp;nbsp;– Upfront Theatre Improv mixes it up|url= http://www.whatsup-magazine.com/index.php?navarea=Archives&amp;storyid=382|publisher= ''What's Up'' magazine|location= [[Bellingham, Washington]]|date=June 2006|accessdate=2008-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stiles holds dual American-Canadian citizenship.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}
