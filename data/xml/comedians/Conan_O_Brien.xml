'''Conan Christopher O'Brien''' (born April 18, 1963) is an American television host, comedian, writer, and producer. He is best known for hosting several [[late-night talk show]]s; since 2010, he has hosted ''[[Conan (talk show)|Conan]]'' on the cable channel [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]]. O'Brien was born in [[Brookline, Massachusetts|Brookline]], [[Massachusetts]], and was raised in an [[Irish Catholic]] family. He served as president of ''[[The Harvard Lampoon]]'' while attending [[Harvard University]], and was a writer for the sketch comedy series ''[[Not Necessarily the News]]''.

After writing for several comedy shows in Los Angeles, he joined the writing staff of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. O'Brien was a writer and producer for ''[[The Simpsons]]'' for two seasons until he was commissioned by [[NBC]] to take over [[David Letterman]]'s position as host of ''[[Late Night (NBC)|Late Night]]'' in 1993. A virtual unknown to the public, O'Brien's initial ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien|Late Night]]'' tenure received unfavorable reviews and remained on a multiweek renewal cycle during its early years. The show generally improved over time and was highly regarded by the time of his departure in 2009. Afterwards, O'Brien relocated from New York to Los Angeles to host his own incarnation of ''[[The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien|The Tonight Show]]'' for seven months until network politics prompted a [[2010 Tonight Show conflict|host change]] in 2010.

Known for his spontaneous hosting style, which has been characterized as "awkward, self-deprecating humor", O'Brien's late-night programs combine the "lewd and wacky with more elegant, narrative-driven short films (remotes)".&lt;ref name="NewYorkT"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/24/magazine/24Conan-t.html?pagewanted=all|title= Heeeere's . . .

With the retirement of [[David Letterman]] on May 20, 2015, O'Brien became the longest-working&lt;!-- TENURE a fixed period of time during which a person holds a job or position --&gt; of all current late-night talk show hosts in the United States, at 22 years.&lt;ref name="letterman retirement"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etonline.com/tv/164753_conan_o_brien_uncomfortable_with_david_letterman_leaving_late_show/|author=Raphael Chestang|title=Conan O'Brien 'Uncomfortable' With David Letterman Leaving 'Late Show'|date=May 18, 2015|accessdate=May 25, 2015|publisher=[[Entertainment Tonight]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
O'Brien was born on April 18, 1963 in [[Brookline, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name="tvg" /&gt; His father, Thomas Francis O'Brien, is a physician, [[epidemiology|epidemiologist]], and professor of medicine at [[Harvard Medical School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=May 9, 2008|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/42/Conan-O-Brien.html|title=Conan O'Brien Biography (1963–)|publisher=Film Reference}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=May 9, 2008|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~battle/celeb/obrien.htm|title=Conan Christopher O'Brien|publisher=Ancestry}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="actors"&gt;Stated on ''[[Inside the Actors Studio]]'', 2009&lt;/ref&gt; His mother, Ruth O'Brien (née Reardon), is a retired attorney and former partner at the Boston firm [[Ropes &amp; Gray]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=January 23, 2010|url=http://www.law.stanford.edu/library/womenslegalhistory/papers/ObrienR-Peddie97.pdf|title=Ruth Reardon O'Brien 1931–|publisher=Stanford.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geni.com/people/Ruth-Reardon-O-Brien/6000000013451612707|title=Ruth Reardon O'Brien|website=geni_family_tree}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Brien has three brothers and two sisters.

O'Brien attended [[Brookline High School]], where he served as the [[managing editor]] of the [[student newspaper|school newspaper]], ''[[The Sagamore (Brookline High School)|The Sagamore]]''.&lt;ref name=actors/&gt; In his second year, O'Brien was an intern for [[Congressman]] [[Robert Drinan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=qQWy40hzNKc&amp;t=0m45s|title="Rehearsal Scraps: Andy Ruins Conan's First Real Human Moment In 15 Years – CONAN on TBS"|link=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in his senior year, he won the [[National Council of Teachers of English]] writing contest with his short story, "To Bury the Living".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Extra Credit: Starting Out with Style|work=The Boston Globe| date= December 3, 1980|last=Coons| first= Phyllis}}&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating as [[valedictorian]] in 1981, he entered [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=May 11, 2008| url= http://www.boston.com/news/globe/living/articles/2003/11/06/monet_goes_to_vegas_kerry_goes_out_on_the_town/| title= Monet goes to Vegas; Kerry goes out on the town| work= Boston Globe| date= November 6, 2003|last= Beggy |first= Carol}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Harvard, O'Brien lived in [[Holworthy Hall]] during his first year&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| accessdate= May 11, 2008| url= http://www.fdo.fas.harvard.edu/icb/icb.do?keyword=k3806&amp;pageid=icb.page101294| title= Harvard College Freshman Dean's Office| publisher= [[Harvard College]]| deadurl= yes| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130731162551/http://www.fdo.fas.harvard.edu/icb/icb.do?keyword=k3806&amp;pageid=icb.page101294| archivedate= July 31, 2013| df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mather House (Harvard University)|Mather House]] during his three upper-class years.

==Career==

===''Saturday Night Live'' (1987–1991)===
[[File:Conan O'Brien - Simpsons (cropped).jpg|right|thumb|O'Brien in the offices of the writers of ''The Simpsons'', 1992]]

O'Brien moved to Los Angeles after graduation to join the writing staff of [[Home Box Office|HBO]]'s ''[[Not Necessarily the News]]''.&lt;ref name="avclub"&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=May 11, 2008|url=http://www.avclub.com/content/node/52144|title=Conan O'Brien|publisher=[[The A.V. Club]]|date=August 30, 2006|author=Rabin, Nathan}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a writer on the short-lived ''[[The Wilton North Report]]''.&lt;ref name="avclub" /&gt; He spent two years with that show and performed regularly with [[improvisation]]al groups, including [[The Groundlings]]. In January 1988, ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'''s executive producer, [[Lorne Michaels]], hired O'Brien as a writer. During his three years on ''Saturday Night Live (SNL)'', he wrote such recurring sketches as "Mr.&amp;nbsp;Short-Term memory" and "The Girl Watchers"; the latter was first performed by [[Tom Hanks]] and [[Jon Lovitz]].&lt;ref name="speakerbio"&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=May 11, 2008|url=http://www.greatertalent.com/speakers/speakers.php?speakerid=235|title=Host of Late Night With Conan O'Brien|publisher=Greater Talent Network |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080418032637/http://www.greatertalent.com/speakers/speakers.php?speakerid=235 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = April 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Brien also co-wrote the sketch "Nude Beach" with [[Robert Smigel]], in which the word "penis" was said or sung at least 42 times. While on a writers' strike from ''Saturday Night Live'' following the 1987–88 season, O'Brien put on an [[improvisational comedy]] revue in Chicago with fellow ''SNL'' writers [[Bob Odenkirk]] and Robert Smigel called ''[[Happy Happy Good Show]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Laugh Lines The Bits and Pieces That Get Comics into the Act|work=Chicago Tribune|date=June 24, 1988|author=Boulware, Hugh}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Live, From Chicago, It's...|work=Chicago Tribune|date=July 29, 1988|author=Bommer, Lawrence}}&lt;/ref&gt; While living in Chicago, O'Brien briefly roomed with [[Jeff Garlin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Jeff Garlin interview|series=[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]|airdate=2007-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, O'Brien and his fellow ''SNL'' writers received an [[Emmy Award]] for Outstanding Writing in a Comedy or Variety Series.

O'Brien, like many ''SNL'' writers, occasionally appeared as an extra in sketches; his most notable appearance was as a doorman in a sketch in which [[Tom Hanks]] was inducted into the SNL "[[Five-Timers Club]]" for hosting his fifth episode. O'Brien returned to host the show in 2001 during its 26th season. O'Brien and [[Robert Smigel]] wrote the television pilot for ''[[Lookwell]]'' starring [[Adam West]], which aired on NBC in 1991. The pilot never went to series, but it became a [[cult hit]]. It was later screened at ''The Other Network'', a festival of unaired TV pilots produced by [[Un-Cabaret]]; it featured an extended interview with O'Brien and was rerun in 2002 on the [[Trio (TV network)|Trio]] network.

Things changed for O'Brien in 1991, when in quick succession, an engagement fell through; ''Lookwell'' was not picked up; and, burned out, he quit ''Saturday Night Live''.&lt;ref name=nymag2/&gt; "I told Lorne Michaels I couldn't come back to work and I just needed to do something else," O'Brien recalled. "I had no plan whatsoever. I was literally in this big transition phase in my life where I decided, I'll just walk around New York City, and an idea will come to me."&lt;ref name=ortved1&gt;Ortved, 2009. p. 160–161&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mike Reiss]] and [[Al Jean]], then dual [[showrunner]]s of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', called O'Brien and offered him a job. The series was notorious in the writing community at the time; O'Brien recalls "everyone wanted to be on that show, but they never hired."&lt;ref name="ortved1" /&gt; O'Brien was one of the first hires after the show's original crew. With the help of old Groundlings friend [[Lisa Kudrow]], O'Brien purchased an apartment in [[Beverly Hills]].&lt;ref name=nymag2/&gt;&lt;ref name=ortved3&gt;Ortved, 2009. p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; He and Kudrow became involved as well, and Kudrow believed he should begin performing rather than writing. O'Brien disagreed, feeling that Kudrow was being overly flattering and that asserting he was happy as a writer. In his speech given at Class Day at Harvard in 2000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=May 11, 2008|url=http://thecrimson.harvard.edu/article.aspx?ref=101192|title=O'Brien Returns to Harvard|publisher=[[Harvard Crimson]]|date=June 8, 2000|author=Volonnino, Michael R.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060915195620/http://www.thecrimson.harvard.edu/article.aspx?ref=101192|archivedate=September 15, 2006|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Brien credited ''The Simpsons'' with saving him, a reference to the career slump he was experiencing prior to his being hired for the show.&lt;ref name="commencement"&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=May 11, 2008|url=http://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=692946|title=Conan O'Brien's Commencement Speech for the Harvard Class of 2000|publisher=[[everything2]]|date=August 8, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Simpsons'' (1991–1993)===
{{quote box|align=right|width=30em|quote=I was very nervous when I started. They showed me into this office and told me to start writing down some ideas. They left me alone in that office. I left after five minutes to go get a cup of coffee. I heard a crash. I walked back to the office, and there was a hole in the window and a dead bird on the floor. Literally, in my first ten minutes at ''The Simpsons'', a bird had flown through the glass of my window, hit the far wall, broken its neck, and fallen dead on the floor. [[George Meyer]] came in and looked at it, and said, "Man, this is some kind of weird omen."|source=— O'Brien on his first moments at ''The Simpsons''&lt;ref name="ortved1" /&gt;}}

From 1991 to 1993, O'Brien was a writer and producer for ''The Simpsons''. When O'Brien first arrived at the Fox lot, they temporarily gave him writer [[Jeff Martin (writer)|Jeff Martin]]'s office. O'Brien was nervous and self-conscious, feeling that he would embarrass himself in front of what he regarded as an intimidating collection of writers.&lt;ref name="ortved1" /&gt; O'Brien would pitch characters in their voices as he thought that was the norm until Reiss informed him that no one did such.&lt;ref name=ortved2&gt;Ortved, 2009. p. 162&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="O'Brien"&gt;O'Brien, Conan. (2003). Commentary for "[[Marge vs. the Monorail]]", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Fourth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt; He fit in quickly, commanding control of the room frequently; [[Josh Weinstein]] called it a "ten-hour Conan show, nonstop".&lt;ref name="ortved1" /&gt; According to John Ortved, one of his fellow writers ventured that if Conan hadn't left to do ''Late Night'', he was a shoo-in to take over as showrunner on ''The Simpsons''.&lt;ref name="ortved1" /&gt;

When not contributing to others' scripts, O'Brien managed to craft what are regarded as some of the series' most memorable and finest episodes: "[[Marge vs. the Monorail]]" and "[[Homer Goes to College]]".&lt;ref name="ortved1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EWsimp"&gt;[http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,417748~3~0~25bestand1,00.html The Family Dynamic] ''EW.com''. Retrieved on February 13, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, critics, fans and even those who worked on the show agree that its sensibilities changed following "Marge vs. the Monorail."&lt;ref name="ortved4" /&gt; The show was initially a highly realistic family sitcom; after O'Brien's debut, the show took a rapid shift in the direction of the surreal.&lt;ref name=ortved4&gt;Ortved, 2009. p. 164&lt;/ref&gt; Along with those episodes, he has sole writing credits on "[[New Kid on the Block]]" and "[[Treehouse of Horror IV]]", on which he wrote the episode [[Treehouse of Horror IV#Production|wraparounds]]. [[Wallace Wolodarsky]] described a "room character" Conan put on for the writers: "Conan used to do this thing called the Nervous Writer that involved him opening a can of [[Diet Coke]] and then nervously pitching a joke. He would spray Diet Coke all over himself, and that was always a source of endless amusement among us."&lt;ref name="ortved2" /&gt; Occasionally, fellow writers from the show would stop by O'Brien's Beverly Hills apartment.&lt;ref name="ortved3" /&gt;

Meanwhile, ''Late Night'' host [[David Letterman]] was preparing to leave, prompting executive producer Lorne Michaels to search for a new host. Michaels approached O'Brien to produce; then-agent [[Gavin Polone]] stressed that O'Brien wanted to perform, rather than produce.&lt;ref name="ortved4" /&gt; He arranged with Michaels that O'Brien would do a test audition on the stage of ''[[The Tonight Show]]''. [[Jason Alexander]] and [[Mimi Rogers]] were the guests, and the audience was composed of ''Simpsons'' writers.&lt;ref name=ortved5&gt;Ortved, 2009. p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; Wolodarksky recalled the experience: "Seeing this friend of yours, this guy that you worked with, walk out from behind that curtain and deliver a monologue was like something you could only dream up that you couldn’t ever imagine actually happening."&lt;ref name="ortved5" /&gt; The performance was beamed by satellite to New York, where Lorne Michaels and NBC executives watched. O'Brien was picked as the new host of ''Late Night'' on April 26, 1993.&lt;ref name="NewYorkT" /&gt; As the writers headed to the voice record for "Homer Goes to College", O'Brien received a phone call from Polone informing him of the decision. "He was passed out facedown into this horrible shag carpet. He was just quiet and comatose down there on that carpet," recalled postproduction supervisor Michael Mendel. "I remember looking at him and saying, 'Wow. Your life is about to change, in a really dramatic way.'"&lt;ref name=ortved6&gt;Ortved, 2009. p. 166-167&lt;/ref&gt;

Fox, however, would not let O'Brien out of his contract.

===''Late Night'' (1993–2009)===
{{Main|Late Night with Conan O'Brien}}
''Late Night with Conan O'Brien'', originating from Studio 6A at [[30 Rockefeller Plaza]] in New York City, premiered September 13, 1993 to unfavorable reviews from contemporary critics. This reception was not completely unsurprising; O'Brien wrote a self-deprecating ''[[The New York Times]]'' piece titled "O'Brien Flops!" on the day of the show's premiere.&lt;ref name="nyt1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/ref/opinion/17opclassic_conan.html|title= O'Brien Flops!|author=Conan O'Brien|date=September 13, 1993|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=December 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics attacked O'Brien: [[Tom Shales]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' suggested that "the host resume his previous identity, Conan O'Blivion."&lt;ref name="NewYorkT" /&gt;&lt;ref name="shales1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Go Gently into That Good Night, Already!|author=[[Tom Shales]]|date=October 19, 1993|publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]''|url=http://nbckicks.tripod.com/gently.html|accessdate=August 27, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130411201729/http://nbckicks.tripod.com/gently.html|archivedate=April 11, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, critics viewed O'Brien as nervous and fidgety on-camera, and that he was "too smart, too East Coast, too sophisticated, too young and even too tall to be successful."&lt;ref name="NewYorkT" /&gt; The show was constantly at risk for cancellation; at one low point in 1994, NBC threatened to put him on a week-to-week contract. Executives were anxious to replace him with [[Greg Kinnear]], who followed O'Brien with ''[[Later (talk show)|Later]]'' at 1:30&amp;nbsp;am.&lt;ref name="NewYorkT" /&gt; Interns filled empty seats in the audience while affiliates began to inquire about replacement hosts.&lt;ref name="nymag1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/arts/features/14575/index3.html|title=Conan on the Couch|author=David Bianculli|date=September 26, 2005|publisher=''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]''|accessdate=December 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="shales2"&gt;{{cite news|title=So I Was Wrong… Late Night's Late Riser|author=[[Tom Shales]]|date=June 18, 1996|publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]''|accessdate=August 27, 2013|url=http://nbckicks.tripod.com/riser.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010094505/http://nbckicks.tripod.com/riser.html|archivedate=October 10, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one installment after a short stretch of reruns, sidekick [[Andy Richter]] described his vacation activities as follows: "I sat back and reminded myself what it's like to be unemployed."

Things would improve slowly. Banter between O'Brien and Richter improved, and sketches grew in popularity ("If They Mated", "Desk Drive", "In the Year 2000").&lt;ref name="shales2" /&gt; A reliable staple involved a TV screen, lowered behind O'Brien's desk and displaying a still photo of news figure. The lips and voice of these characters – frequently a party-crazed hillbilly interpretation of [[Bill Clinton]] – were supplied by writing partner [[Robert Smigel]].&lt;ref name="shales2" /&gt; A turning point was David Letterman's February 1994 appearance. "It was a morale boost," said O'Brien.

O'Brien's audience, largely young and male (a coveted demographic), grew steadily and the show began to best competitors in the ratings, which it would continue to do for 15 seasons.&lt;ref name="NewYorkT" /&gt; In the early days of the Internet, fans launched unofficial websites, compiling precise summaries of each episode.&lt;ref name="tvguide"&gt;{{cite news|title=Who'd Have Thought?

{{As of|2005|10}}, ''Late Night with Conan O'Brien'' had for eleven years consistently attracted an audience averaging about 2.5&amp;nbsp;million viewers.&lt;ref name="nymag1" /&gt; The apotheosis of the ''Late Night'' remotes centered on the realization in 2006 that O'Brien bore a striking resemblance to the then female president of [[Finland]], [[Tarja Halonen]].

On February 20, 2009, NBC aired the last episode of ''Late Night with Conan O'Brien''. The show consisted of a compilation of previous ''Late Night'' clips and included a surprise appearance by former sidekick [[Andy Richter]].

On Thursday, January 7, 2010, NBC executive Jeff Zucker met with Jay Leno and Conan O'Brien to discuss how to get Leno out of prime time, where his ratings were lackluster, and back into late night, where O'Brien's ratings had collapsed before Leno's prime time series began.

[[File:Im With Coco.jpg|upright|thumb|A poster created by [[Mike Mitchell (artist)|Mike Mitchell]] during the [[2010 Tonight Show conflict]] displaying his "Coco" nickname]]
Conan acquired the nickname "'''Coco'''" after its use in the first "Twitter Tracker" sketch during the second episode of his ''Tonight Show'' run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tonightshowwithconanobrien.com/video/clips/twitter-tracker-060209/1116881/ |title=Twitter Tracker, 2 June 2009 |accessdate=January 21, 2010 |publisher=tonightshowwithconanobrien.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090706084046/http://www.tonightshowwithconanobrien.com/video/clips/twitter-tracker-060209/1116881/ |archivedate=July 6, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Guest [[Tom Hanks]] used the nickname during his subsequent interview, even getting the audience to chant it. In reaction to the [[moniker]], Conan remarked to Hanks in jest, "If that catches on, I'll sue you."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tonightshowwithconanobrien.com/video/clips/tom-hanks-interview-pt-1-060209/1116835/ |title=Tom Hanks Interview Pt. 1, 2 June 2009 |accessdate=January 21, 2010 |publisher=tonightshowwithconanobrien.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813001001/http://www.tonightshowwithconanobrien.com/video/clips/tom-hanks-interview-pt-1-060209/1116835/ |archivedate=August 13, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tonightshowwithconanobrien.com/video/clips/tom-hanks-interview-pt-2-060209/1116734/ |title=Tom Hanks Interview Pt. 2, 2 June 2009 |accessdate=January 21, 2010 |publisher=tonightshowwithconanobrien.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813024814/http://www.tonightshowwithconanobrien.com/video/clips/tom-hanks-interview-pt-2-060209/1116734/ |archivedate=August 13, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a March 23, 2011 interview with [[WWE]] [[WWE World Heavyweight Championship|Champion]] [[The Miz]] on ''[[Conan (talk show)|Conan]]'', The Miz dubbed Conan '''"The Ginja Ninja"''', a reference to Conan's [[red hair]] and the fact that he came back fighting to get his new late-night talk show. A week later, "Team Ginja Ninja" T-shirts were available on TeamCoco.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://teamcoco.com/content/look-out-ginja-ninja-t-shirts-are-here|title = Look Out!

On ''Late Night,'' O'Brien became known for his active and [[Ad libitum|spontaneous]] hosting style,&lt;ref name=actors/&gt; which has been characterized as "awkward, self-deprecating humor".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2009/06/02/awkward_self_deprecating_humor_makes_a_r_1 |title=Awkward, Self-Deprecating Humor Makes A Return As Conan O'Brien Debuts in LA |publisher=Starpulse.com |date=June 2, 2009 |accessdate=February 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
[[File:O'Brien, Conan (with Elizabeth Ann Powel).jpg|thumb|upright|O'Brien with his wife Liza in 2007]]
O'Brien met Elizabeth Ann 'Liza' Powel in 2000, when she appeared on ''Late Night with Conan O'Brien'' in an advertising skit&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/8841769|title=Conan meets Liza Powel at Foote, Cone &amp; Belding|publisher=Vimeo|accessdate=June 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; involving [[Draftfcb|Foote, Cone &amp; Belding]], where she worked as senior copywriter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=May 11, 2008|url=https://www.eonline.com/uberblog/b51057_Conans_Baby_OBrien.html | archive-date  =2009-02-17 | deadurl = yes | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090217032247/http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/b51057_Conans_Baby_OBrien.html |title=Conan's Baby O'Brien|publisher=[[E!

On a 2009 episode of ''[[Inside the Actors Studio]]'', he stated that ancestors from both sides of his family moved to America from Ireland starting in the 1850s, subsequently marrying only other Irish Catholics, and that his lineage is thus 100% Irish Catholic.&lt;ref name=actors/&gt;

He has been a staunch [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] since casting his first vote for President in 1984 for [[Walter Mondale]]. He considers himself a [[centrism|moderate]] on the political spectrum.&lt;ref name=actors/&gt; O'Brien's longtime friend and former dormmate in Mather House at Harvard is Father Paul B. O' Brien, with whom he founded ''Labels Are For Jars'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=May 11, 2008|url=http://www.labelsareforjars.org|title=Labels are for Jars|publisher=Labels are for Jars}}&lt;/ref&gt; an antihunger organization based in [[Lawrence, Massachusetts]], and helped open the ''Cor Unum'' meal center in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Betances, Yadira, [https://archive.is/20120728164524/http://www.eagletribune.com/punews/local_story_271093855 "One year, 100,000 meals; Cor Unum reaches milestone feeding the hungry"], ''The Eagle-Tribune'', Lawrence, Massachusetts, September 28, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The two are not related.

In January 2008, after his show was put on hold for two months owing to the [[2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike|strike by the Writers Guild of America]], he reemerged on late-night TV sporting a [[beard]], which guest [[Tom Brokaw]] described as making him look like "a draft dodger from the Civil War." After leaving ''[[The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien]]'' on January 22, 2010, O'Brien again grew a beard, which he kept until May 2, 2011, when it was partially shaved on the set of his [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] talk show, ''[[Conan (talk show)|Conan]]'', by [[Will Ferrell]] with battery-operated clippers (and completely shaved off-screen by a professional barber).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2011-05-04|url=http://teamcoco.com/content/watch-conans-beard-get-shaved-real-during-commercial-break|title=Watch Conan's Beard Get Shaved For Real During The Commercial Break|publisher=TeamCoco.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event was dubbed on the show as "Beardpocalypse", and included a contest for fan-submitted artwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2011-05-04|url=http://teamcoco.com/content/slideshow-best-beardpocalypse-photoshop-contest-so-far?photo=8561|title=The Best of the Beardpocalypse Photoshop Contest|publisher=TeamCoco.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Brien purchased a $10.5-million mansion in [[Brentwood, Los Angeles, California]], to prepare for his move there in 2009 from New York City to host ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' at [[Universal Studios Hollywood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=May 11, 2008|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/sfgate/detail?blogid=7&amp;entry_id=23616|title=O'Brien Spends Big in L.A.|work=San Francisco Chronicle | first=Karen | last=Reardanz | date=January 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of a long-running gag, he brought his 1992 [[Ford Taurus SHO]] with him to California, showcasing it on both the inaugural episodes of ''The Tonight Show'' and ''Conan''.

On June 12, 2011, O'Brien gave a commencement address to the class of 2011 at [[Dartmouth College]].

On October 21, 2011, O'Brien was ordained as a minister by the [[Universal Life Church Monastery]],&lt;ref name="obrien"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ulc.org/2011/10/universal-life-church-monastery-minister-conan-obrien-to-perform-gay-wedding/|title = Universal Life Church Monastery Minister Conan O'Brien to Perform Gay Wedding|publisher = Universal Life Church Monastery|date = October 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="obrien2"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.themonastery.org/|title = Video of Conan O'Brien Getting Ordained – Universal Life Church Monastery|accessdate = February 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; allowing him to perform a same-sex marriage while back in New York, then one of the few states in the US where gay marriage was legal, to tape a week's worth of shows. The wedding, between a member of O'Brien's staff and his partner, was held on the stage of the [[Beacon Theatre (New York City)|Beacon Theatre]] on November 3, 2011, and broadcast on ''Conan''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/11/04/conan-obrien-gay-wedding_n_1075414.html Conan O'Brien Officiates Gay Wedding Of Scott Cronick And David Gorshein On Air (VIDEO)], ''Huffington Post'', November 4, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Victim of stalking===
Starting in September 2006, O'Brien was [[Stalking|stalked]] by Father David Ajemian of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston|Archdiocese of Boston]], who, despite multiple warnings to stop, sent O'Brien letters signed as "your priest stalker" and came into contact with O'Brien's parents. O'Brien and Ajemian had attended [[Harvard University]] at the same time. Frustrated that he had been denied a spot in the ''Late Night'' audience, Ajemian sent a letter to O'Brien stating that he flew to New York "in the dimming hope that you might finally acknowledge me." He stated in another letter, "Is this the way you treat your most dangerous fans??? You owe me big time, pal." In another letter, Ajemian seemed to make a death threat, saying, "Remember [[Frank Costello]] once dodged a bullet in your building and so can you."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/08/arts/08conan.html|title=Priest Jailed in Stalking of Conan O’Brien|last=Lambert|first=Bruce|date=2007-11-08|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-09-27|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ajemian then tried to forcefully enter a taping of ''Late Night'' but was caught and arrested. He was previously warned by the NBC security team to stay away from the studio. After a psychological evaluation, he was deemed fit to stand trial. He was bailed out of jail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://news.aol.com/entertainment/television/tv-news-story/ar/_a/conans-alleged-priest-stalker-in-court/20071108070609990001|title = Conan's Alleged 'Priest Stalker' in Court}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was then reported missing by his father on November 10, 2007. He was found and underwent evaluation at a hospital. He was again found fit to stand trial on April 4, 2008. On April 8, Ajemian pleaded guilty to stalking, stating that he "never meant to cause anxiety or to upset anyone." He was ordered to pay a $95 court charge and to sign a two-year [[restraining order]] barring him from coming near O'Brien.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://news.aol.com/entertainment/story/_a/conan-obrien-stalker-pleads-guilty/n20080408181909990014|title = Conan Stalker Pleads Guilty}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 11, 2008, Ajemian checked himself out of his treatment at a hospital against the wishes of his bishop, [[Seán Patrick O'Malley]]. Cardinal O'Malley then released a statement saying that, because he violated his bishop's wishes, Ajemian [[Defrocking|could no longer serve as a priest]] in the Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/09/12/david-ajemian-conans-prie_n_125918.html|title = Conan O'Brien's Stalker Checks Out of Treatment|work = Huffington Post|date = September 12, 2008|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080915032034/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/09/12/david-ajemian-conans-prie_n_125918.html|archivedate = September 15, 2008|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2010/11/19/priest-in-conan-obrien-stalker-case-arrested-again/|title=Priest in Conan O’Brien stalker case arrested again|date=2010-11-19|work=New York Post|access-date=2017-09-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2010, Ajemian was charged with harassing the TV host Anthony Everett while violating a restraining order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/11/19/david-ajemian-conan-obrie_n_785912.html|title = David Ajemian, Conan O'Brien's Stalker Priest, Arrested AGAIN|work = Huffington Post|date = November 19, 2010|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101124035530/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/11/19/david-ajemian-conan-obrie_n_785912.html|archivedate = November 24, 2010|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
