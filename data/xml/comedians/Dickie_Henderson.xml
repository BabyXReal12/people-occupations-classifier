==Early years==
His father, Dick Henderson (1891–1958), was a [[music hall]] comedian and singer famous for his short, rotund appearance, bowler hat and beautiful singing voice. He was well known for making the original British recording of the popular song "[[Tiptoe Through the Tulips]]".&lt;ref name=timesobit&gt;{{cite web|url=https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/alt.obituaries/OoPHRRBBa2I|title=Google Groups|website=groups.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; His two daughters Winifred and Teresa known as "the Henderson Twins", were also performers in the style of the [[Andrews Sisters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=WvI6DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT124&amp;lpg=PT124&amp;dq=dickie+henderson+%22Tiptoe+Through+the+Tulips%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bZkNl2J5Vb&amp;sig=kQGKY9UmjP8GocXyyT_7fmjryyQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0a|title=High Buildings, Low Morals: Another Sideways Look at Twentieth Century London|first=Rob|last=Baker|date=15 October 2017|publisher=Amberley Publishing Limited|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Henderson was privately educated in both [[Hollywood]], when his father was touring in vaudeville, and Britain, at [[St Joseph's College, Upper Norwood|St Joseph's College, Beulah Hill, London]].&lt;ref name=timesobit/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.allmovie.com/artist/dickie-henderson-p198689|title=Dickie Henderson - Biography, Movie Highlights and Photos - AllMovie|website=AllMovie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In America, Henderson broke into show business, aged 10, when he was offered a role as the son of [[Clive Brook]] and [[Diana Wynyard]] in the [[Frank Lloyd]] film version of [[Noël Coward]]'s play, ''[[Cavalcade (1933 film)|Cavalcade]]'' (1933).&lt;ref name=bfi&gt;{{cite web|url=http://explore.bfi.org.uk/4ce2b9f46d9c9|title=Dickie Henderson|work=BFI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was also in the running for the part of David Copperfield in [[George Cukor]]'s [[David Copperfield (1935 film)|film of the same name]], but his father insisted that he decline the part and return to Britain, because he felt Hollywood was not the place for a young boy.
