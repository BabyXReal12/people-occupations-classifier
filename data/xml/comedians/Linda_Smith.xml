A tribute show of the same name was aired on BBC Radio 4 on 10 November 2006. Smith's sell-out stage show ''Wrap Up Warm'' has been available on CD since November 2006.

Linda Smith was working on a third series of ''A Brief History of Timewasting'' before she became incapacitated by her illness. As a tribute the online radio station [[BBC 7]] ran the previous two series, the first all on one day.
