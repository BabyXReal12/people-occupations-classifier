Journal of Psychology 41:2, pp. 23-25&lt;/ref&gt; The series then gained a strong cult following.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.us/tv/freaks-and-geeks/182832/freaks-and-geeks-the-enduring-legacy-of-a-short-lived-show|title=Freaks and Geeks: The Enduring Legacy of a Short-Lived Show|work=Den of Geek|first=Chris|last=Longo|date=September 2, 2013|accessdate=November 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2009 to 2010, Starr was a series regular on the [[Starz]] sitcom, ''[[Party Down]]'', portraying Roman DeBeers. The series was cancelled after two seasons and there was discussions of adapting the series into film, but it never came to fruition.&lt;ref name="nicoletti1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.movieline.com/2012/01/19/martin-starr-on-his-sundance-premiere-save-the-date-and-the-party-down-movie-theres-nothing-official/|title=Martin Starr on His Sundance Premiere ''Save the Date'' and the ''Party Down'' Movie: 'There's Nothing Official'|work=Movieline|first=Karen|last=Nicoletti|date=January 19, 2012|accessdate=February 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2011, he has co-starred on the [[Adult Swim]] television series ''[[NTSF:SD:SUV::]]'', in which he plays Sam Stern.
