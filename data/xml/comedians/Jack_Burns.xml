[[File:Avery Schreiber and Jack Burns 1966.jpg|thumb|[[Avery Schreiber]] and Jack Burns (1966) ]]
'''John Francis Burns''' (born November 15, 1933) is an [[United States|American]] [[comedian]], [[actor]], [[Voice acting|voice actor]], [[writer]] and [[Television producer|producer]].  During the 1960s, he was part of two [[stand-up comedy]] partnerships, first with [[George Carlin]] and later [[Avery Schreiber]].  By the 1970s, he had transitioned to working behind the camera, as a writer and producer on such comedy series as ''[[The Muppet Show]]'' and ''[[Hee Haw]]''.  He also had many roles as a voice actor.

==Biography==
Burns began his comedy career in 1959, when he partnered with [[George Carlin]]; both were working for radio station [[KMNY|KXOL]] in [[Fort Worth, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.texasradiohalloffame.com/georgecarlin.html |publisher=Texas Radio Hall of Fame| title=George Carlin |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013075010/http://texasradiohalloffame.com/georgecarlin.html |archivedate=October 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After successful performances at a Fort Worth [[Beat Generation|beat]] coffeehouse, The Cellar, Burns and Carlin headed for California in February 1960 and continued to work together for two more years. An album containing some of their material was released in 1963, titled ''[[Burns and Carlin at the Playboy Club Tonight]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/09/the-best-of-george-carlin-ranking-every-album.html |title=The Best of George Carlin: Ranking Every Album| last=Kozak| first=Oktay Ege| date=September 7, 2017| work=[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]| access-date=2017-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Longer lasting was a later teaming with [[Avery Schreiber]], whom he met when they were both members of [[The Second City]], a live comedy and improv troupe based in Chicago. Burns and Schreiber were best known for a series of routines in which Burns played a talkative [[taxicab]] passenger, with Schreiber as the driver.&lt;ref name=obit1&gt;{{cite news |first=Dennis |last= McLellan |title=Avery Schreiber, 66.

In 1973, ABC gave them a summer variety series, "The Burns and Schreiber Comedy Hour." |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=January 9, 2002 |accessdate=2008-04-26 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the first half of the 1965-1966 season of ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'', in an attempt to replace the [[Don Knotts|Don Knotts']] [[Barney Fife]] character after Knotts left the show, Burns was cast as [[Warren Ferguson]], a dedicated but inept deputy [[sheriff]]. His character was not popular, and was dropped after eleven appearances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.journalnow.com/news/ask_sam/ask-sam-why-did-don-knotts-leave-the-andy-griffith/article_38e4a00a-c279-567e-a17d-2c39347e5ea4.html| title=Ask SAM: Why did Don Knotts leave 'The Andy Griffith Show'?| last=Clodfelter| first=Tim| date=July 5, 2017| work=[[Winston-Salem Journal]]| access-date=2017-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, he was cast as 'Candy Butcher' in ''[[The Night They Raided Minsky's]]''.

In 1971, he was cast as Mr. Kelly in ''[[The Partridge Family ]]'' episode "Dora, Dora, Dora", (S2/Ep1).

Burns voiced Harry Boyle's (Tom Bosley) fanatically reactionary neighbor, Ralph Kane, in the short-lived syndicated primetime cartoon ''[[Wait Till Your Father Gets Home]]''. The series was a forerunner of [[adult animation]] comedies.

Burns was the head writer for the first season of ''[[Hee Haw]]'' and ''[[The Muppet Show]]''. Schreiber appeared on an episode with ''The Muppet Show'' during that first season. Burns also co-wrote ''[[The Muppet Movie]]'' (with [[Jerry Juhl]], his successor as head writer of ''The Muppet Show''.)

He hosted a 1977 episode of [[NBC]]'s ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', the first to carry this title (the show was initially called ''NBC's Saturday Night''), after [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s'' [[Saturday Night Live with Howard Cosell]]'' - a different program - was canceled.

In the early 1980s, Burns became a writer, announcer and sometimes-performer on the ABC sketch comedy series ''[[Fridays (TV series)|Fridays]]''. He and comedian [[Michael Richards]] were involved in [[Andy Kaufman#Fridays incidents|a staged on-air]] fight with [[Andy Kaufman]], later re-created in the Kaufman biopic ''[[Man on the Moon (film)|Man on the Moon]]''.

He teamed with [[Lorenzo Music]] to provide the voices for a pair of [[crash test dummy|crash test dummies]] respectively named Vince and Larry in a series of [[United States Department of Transportation]] [[public service announcement]]s that promoted the use of [[seat belt]]s. Distributed by the [[Ad Council]], the [[advertising campaign]] ran from 1985 to 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Lorraine |last=Mirabella |url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/business/bs-bz-interview-joel-machak-20100730,0,2055928,full.story |title=Annapolis ad man one of the brains behind the Crash Test Dummies |newspaper=[[The Baltimore Sun]] |date=2010-07-30 |accessdate=2014-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, Burns starred in the cartoon-series ''[[Animaniacs]]'', as the voice of [[Sid the Squid]], giving the character a raspy, [[Daffy Duck]] kind of voice. Schreiber also appeared on the show, as Beanie the Bison.

Burns was a guest voice in the a 1999 episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', "[[Beyond Blunderdome]]".
