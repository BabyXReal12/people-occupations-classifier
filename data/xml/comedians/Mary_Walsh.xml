'''Mary Cynthia Walsh''' {{postnom|CM}} &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://isn.net/iode/awards.html|title=Six individuals received a University of Prince Edward Island Doctor of Laws Degrees, honoris causa in May 2003.|publisher=Lake of Shining Awards|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121035540/http://www.isn.net/iode/awards.html|archivedate=2008-11-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (born May 13, 1952) is a Canadian [[actress]], [[comedian]] and [[social activist]].&lt;ref name=canenc&gt;[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/mary-walsh/ "Mary Walsh"]. ''[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]'', January 1, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==  Early life ==
Walsh was born in [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], the daughter of Mary and Leo Walsh, a merchant marine turned firefighter on commercial vessels. She's the 7th of 8 children. She is also of Irish ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/whodoyouthinkyouare/stories/ext_mary.php |title=Who Do You Think You Are? |work=Cbc.ca |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090331114451/http://www.cbc.ca/whodoyouthinkyouare/stories/ext_mary.php |archivedate=March 31, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Walsh studied [[theatre]] in [[Toronto]] at [[Ryerson University]] but dropped out to work with the [[CODCO]] comedy troupe on a series of stage shows, which eventually evolved into a sketch comedy series.&lt;ref name=early&gt;{{cite web|title=Mary Walsh: Warrior princess - Everything Zoomer - Boomers with Zip|url=http://www.everythingzoomer.com/mary-walsh-warrior-princess/|website=Everything Zoomer - Boomers with Zip|accessdate=17 October 2016|date=1 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''CODCO'' series ran from 1987 to 1992 on [[CBC Television]].

===This Hour Has 22 Minutes===
In 1992, she began to work with former co-star [[Rick Mercer]] and former ''CODCO'' co-stars [[Cathy Jones]] and [[Greg Thomey]] to create a new television series called ''[[This Hour Has 22 Minutes]]''.&lt;ref name=early /&gt; The show would be a parody of the nightly news and would poke fun at Canadian and international politics. ''22 Minutes'' received strong ratings during its earlier seasons and Walsh's character Marg Delahunty became famous for buttonholing politicians and submitting them to satirical interviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mary Walsh resurrects Marg to bring change to Ottawa|url=https://ca.news.yahoo.com/blogs/canada-politics/mary-walsh-resurrects-marg-to-bring-change-to-134904937.html|website=ca.news.yahoo.com|accessdate=17 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually Marg Delahunty would recite a scripted piece intended to humiliate the politician, often by providing criticism and "grandmotherly" advice. Sometimes Marg appeared as "Marg, Princess Warrior", a parody of the title character of ''[[Xena: Warrior Princess]]'' portrayed by [[Lucy Lawless]]. Walsh is also noted for her comical segment chronicling the [[Canadian Auto Workers| Canadian Auto Workers Union]]'s tense blockade of the [[Volvo Halifax Assembly]] plant in 1998. In 2007 she revived Marg Delahunty for the [[Royal Canadian Air Farce]]'s 300th episode, filmed in Toronto in March. On October 24, 2011, Walsh was once again in the spotlight as she reprised the role of Marg Delahunty conducting an ambush interview of Toronto Mayor [[Rob Ford]] at his home. Ford's reaction and alleged verbal abuse directed at 911 operator made national headlines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/article/1076717--ford-admits-using-f-word-denies-insulting-911-operator?bn=1|title=Ford admits using f-word, denies insulting a 911 operator |work=Toronto Star | date=October 27, 2011|first1=Brendan|last1=Kennedy|first2=David|last2=Rider}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Walsh's other television work included the short-run [[sitcom]]s ''[[Dooley Gardens]]'' in 1999, ''[[Hatching, Matching and Dispatching]]''&lt;ref name=early /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HATCHING, MATCHING &amp; DISPATCHING PREMIERES JAN. 6 ON CBC|url=http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/hatching-matching-dispatching-premieres-jan-6-on-cbc-571675.htm|website=marketwired.com|accessdate=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and she had a guest starring role as Miranda Cahill on the CBC television series, ''[[Republic of Doyle]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jake Doyle's last ride: Social media reacts|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/jake-doyle-s-last-ride-social-media-reacts-to-republic-of-doyle-finale-1.2869261|website=CBC News|accessdate=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She created the CBC program ''[[Mary Walsh: Open Book]]'', a talk show about books and literature, in 2003.&lt;ref name=early /&gt;

===Directing===
Walsh made her feature directorial debut with the 2007 movie ''[[Young Triffie]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=YOUNG TRIFFIE'S BEEN MADE AWAY WITH - Telefilm Canada|url=https://www.telefilm.ca/en/catalogues/production/young-triffie-s-been-made-away|website=www.telefilm.ca|accessdate=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the first Newfoundlander in six years to have a film in general release across Canada.

===Other work===

Walsh herself did not go nude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/tv/story/2007/12/15/walsh-nudity-shoot.html |title=Nude St. John's waterfront TV shoot attracts 50 |work=CBC News |date=December 15, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071216235923/http://www.cbc.ca/arts/tv/story/2007/12/15/walsh-nudity-shoot.html |archivedate=December 16, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
