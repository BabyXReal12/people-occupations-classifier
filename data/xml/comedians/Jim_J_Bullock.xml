'''James Jackson Bullock''' (born February 9, 1955), sometimes credited as '''Jm J. Bullock''', is an American [[actor]] and [[comedian]] of [[theatre|stage]], [[television program|television]] and [[film|motion pictures]].

==Early life==
Bullock was born in [[Casper, Wyoming]], and raised in [[Odessa, Texas]] (although  he is listed as an alumnus of [[Natrona County High School]] ([[Casper, Wyoming]]), and was raised in a [[Southern Baptist Convention|Southern Baptist]] home.&lt;ref name=desert_sun_20110123/&gt; As a youth, Bullock planned to study to become an evangelical Christian minister.&lt;ref name=desert_sun_20110123/&gt; He received a music scholarship to attend [[Oklahoma Baptist University]] in [[Shawnee, Oklahoma]], but left school without graduating.&lt;ref name=advocate_19990720&gt;{{Cite web | url= | work=[[The Advocate]] | first=Bohdan | last=Zachary | title=The Comeback Kidder | date=July 20, 1999 | accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Bullock became a notable entertainment figure in the 1980s when he co-starred on the [[Situation comedy|sitcom]] ''[[Too Close for Comfort]]'' as Monroe Ficus (credited as "Jm J. Bullock") and was a regular "square" on [[John Davidson (entertainer)|John Davidson]]'s updated version of ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'' (1986–1989), also substituting for Davidson as host on occasion.&lt;ref name="av140615"&gt;{{cite news |first1=Marah |last1=Eakin |first2=John |last2=Teti |first3=Erik |last3=Adams |work=[[The A.V. Club]] |title=Bonus round stars: 9 celebrities who found their greatest fame on game shows |url=http://www.avclub.com/article/bonus-round-stars-9-celebrities-who-found-their-gr-205592 |date=June 16, 2014 |accessdate=June 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also appeared as a semi-regular on ''[[Battlestars (game show)|Battlestars]]''. He later became a semi-regular on ''[[ALF (TV series)|ALF]]'' (from 1989 to 1990) as Neal Tanner. He guest-hosted a special episode of ''[[Double Dare (Nickelodeon game show)|Super Sloppy Double Dare]]'' in 1989 where host [[Marc Summers]] and announcer [[Harvey (announcer)|Harvey]] played against each other. The game ended with both Summers and Harvey playing the Obstacle Course and winning all eight prizes for their respective civilian teammates. Stage assistants Robin Marrella and Dave Shikiar guest-announced that episode.

After ''ALF'' went off the air, Bullock remained active with [[theatre]], [[television]], and [[film]] work. He briefly hosted a syndicated [[talk show]] with ex-[[televangelist]] [[Tammy Faye Messner]]. The ''Jim J. and Tammy Faye Show'' debuted in 1996, but Messner exited the program a few months later following a cancer diagnosis. Bullock continued with new co-host, Ann Abernathy, and the show became ''The Jim J. and Ann Show'' until it was canceled.

Bullock was the voice of ''[[Queer Duck]]'' in the animated series of cartoons of the same name which have appeared on both the [[internet]] and the cable TV network [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]]. In 2000, Bullock was a regular panelist on the revival of ''[[I've Got a Secret]]''. He also performed on the national tour of the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production ''[[Hairspray (musical)|Hairspray]]'' as Wilbur Turnblad, a role he took to the Broadway stage starting September 18, 2007. Some of his other noteworthy roles include the pilled-up narcoleptic Prince [[Valium]] in the 1987 [[Mel Brooks]] movie ''[[Spaceballs]]'', and the "Not-Quite-Out-of-the-Closet" character in the date montage at the beginning of 2001's ''[[Kissing Jessica Stein]]''. From 2004 to 2007, he had a recurring role as Mr. Monroe, a teacher at the fictional James K. Polk Middle School on the [[Nickelodeon]] live action sitcom ''[[Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide]]''.

==Personal life==
In 1985, while ''Too Close For Comfort'' was being retooled as ''The Ted Knight Show'', Bullock learned that he was [[HIV]] positive. In a 1985 appearance on the game show ''[[Body Language (game show)|Body Language]]'', host [[Tom Kennedy (television presenter)|Tom Kennedy]] described him as looking "like you're in the pink of health and all of that," to which a flustered Bullock responded "I'm, I'm...no, I'm about to die, actually. But let's not talk about that now, OK? Fabulous." Kennedy then remarked that "If you've got about four days left in you, we'll make it till Thursday," and Bullock replied, "I've got four days, yeah."{{cn|date=January 2017}}

In 1996, Bullock's partner of six years, John Casey, died from [[AIDS]]-related complications.&lt;ref name=desert_sun_20110123/&gt;&lt;ref name=advocate_19990720/&gt;  Bullock is a longtime survivor of the virus and, as of 2011, was still healthy due in part to [[antiretroviral drug]]s.&lt;ref name=desert_sun_20110123/&gt;&lt;ref name=usatoday_20010606&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/health/spotlight/2001-06-06-bullock-aids.htm | work=[[USA Today]] | first=Mike | last=Falcon | title=Jim J. Bullock reflects on AIDS anniversary | date=June 6, 2001 | accessdate=January 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 17, 1999, Bullock was arrested outside a bar in [[West Hollywood, California]], for possession of [[crystal meth]], and was sentenced to probation.&lt;ref name=advocate_19990720/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20131630,00.html|title=Too Close for Comfort: 1980-1985|publisher=People.com|accessdate=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
