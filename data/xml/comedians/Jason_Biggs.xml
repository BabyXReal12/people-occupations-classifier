==Early life==
Biggs was born in the Pompton Plains section of [[Pequannock Township, New Jersey]]. His mother, Angela (née Zocco), is a nurse, and his father, Gary Louis Biggs, is a shipping company manager.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmreference.com/film/20/Jason-Biggs.html "Jason Biggs Biography (1978–)"].

He grew up in [[Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey|Hasbrouck Heights]] and attended [[Hasbrouck Heights High School]],&lt;ref&gt;McKinley, Jesse.

Accessed March 3, 2008. "Unlike that character, Mr. Biggs was proving to be a pretty normal teenager, playing high school tennis and holding a series of menial jobs (flower delivery boy, sandwich maker, guitarist in think big, food and beverage manager at the Sherman theatre, kitchen staff at a hospital). In 1996, he graduated from Hasbrouck Heights High School and started at [[New York University]], where he enrolled in the College of Arts and Sciences."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teenhollywood.com/d/4484/1038/jason-biggs-is-hot.html "Jason Biggs is Hot"].

==Career==
[[Image:JasonBiggs06TIFF.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Biggs at the [[2006 Toronto International Film Festival|Toronto International Film Festival]] in September 2006]]
Biggs began acting at the age of five. In 1991, he made his television debut in the short lived [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] series ''[[Drexell's Class]]''. In 1988, he received his [[Screen Actors Guild]] card for appearing in a TV commercial for [[Pathmark]]. He later recalled in a 2015 interview in ''[[TV Guide]]'', "I remember I had to eat a doughnut in one of the shots. Over and over again. Awesome."&lt;ref&gt;Moynihan, Rob (January 19, 2015). "How I Got My [[Screen Actors Guild|SAG]]-[[AFTRA]] Card", ''[[TV Guide]]''. p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

When Biggs was 12, he starred in a one-off [[HBO]] special, ''The Fotis Sevastakis Story'', but due to licensing arguments, it was never aired. That same year, Biggs debuted on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in ''[[Conversations with My Father]]'' with [[Judd Hirsch]].&lt;ref&gt;Biggs, Jason (August 1, 2012). [http://www.backstage.com/advice-for-actors/standing-ovation/jason-biggs-on-judd-hirsch-in-conversations-with-my-father/ "Jason Biggs on Judd Hirsch in 'Conversations With My Father'"]. ''[[Backstage (magazine)|Backstage]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; He then starred in the daytime [[soap opera]], ''[[As the World Turns]]'', for which he was nominated for the Daytime [[Emmy Award]] for Best Younger Actor.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Biggs attended [[New York University]] briefly from 1996–1997, but soon afterwards, he returned to pursue acting. And so he would be seen again in another short lived television series, 1997's ''Camp Stories''. He then starred in ''[[American Pie (film)|American Pie]]'', which went on to become an international hit that has spawned three [[sequel]]s (also starring Biggs) and four spinoffs (that did not star Biggs). After that, Biggs accepted starring roles in movies such as ''[[Loser (film)|Loser]]'' in 2000, and others. In 2001, Biggs starred in the comedy ''[[Saving Silverman]]''. He appeared in the 2002 Broadway production of ''[[The Graduate]]'' as Benjamin Braddock alongside  [[Kathleen Turner]] and [[Alicia Silverstone]]. In 2003, Biggs appeared as Jerry Falk in the [[Woody Allen]] romantic comedy ''[[Anything Else]]''. In the 2004–2005 season Biggs portrayed an [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jew]] in Daniel Goldfarb's comedy, ''Modern Orthodox'', staged at Dodger Stages theater in [[New York City]]. In 2006, Biggs was seen in the [[MTV]] [[reality show]] ''[[Blowin' Up]]'' with [[Jamie Kennedy]] and [[Stu Stone]] which led to his participation in a hip-hop recording with Bay Area rapper [[E-40]]. Biggs returned to the stage in the fall of 2008 in [[Howard Korder]]'s ''Boys' Life'' at New York City's [[Second Stage Theatre]].

Biggs has appeared in several other films, including ''[[Texas Rangers (film)|Texas Rangers]]'' and ''[[Over Her Dead Body]]''. In 2010, Biggs made his literary debut by contributing "Scratch-and-Sniff," a poem about growing up in New Jersey, to the anthology ''What's Your Exit? A Literary Detour through New Jersey'' (Word Riot Press, 2010), alongside writers such as [[Joyce Carol Oates]], [[Tom Perrotta]], [[Robert Pinsky]], [[Gerald Stern]], and [[J. Robert Lennon]]. In 2012, he contributed to the anthology, ''Oy! Only Six? Why Not More: Six-Word Memoirs on Jewish Life.'' His contribution, "This is a Roman nose, OK?", was both ironic and prescient: Biggs is not Jewish and the editor of the anthology is [[Larry Smith (editor)|Larry Smith]], creator of ''[[Six-Word Memoirs]]'', who a year later would be the basis for Bigg's ''[[Orange Is the New Black]]'' character Larry Bloom. He departed the series in February 2015 after two seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/02/20/jason-biggs-not-returning-orange-new-black-season-3 |title=Jason Biggs not returning for Orange Is the New Black season 3|newspaper=''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''|date=February 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Biggs is sometimes cast as an explicitly or implicitly [[Judaism|Jewish]] character, as he was in ''American Pie'', ''[[Saving Silverman]]'', ''[[Anything Else]], ''and ''[[Orange Is the New Black|Orange is the New Black]]''.
