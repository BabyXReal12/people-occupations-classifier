'''Noel Fielding''' (born 21 May 1973) is an English [[comedian]], [[writer]], [[actor]], [[artist]], [[musician]] and [[television presenter]]. He is known for being part of [[The Mighty Boosh]] comedy troupe alongside comedy partner [[Julian Barratt]].

Born and raised in London, Fielding was educated at [[Croydon College|Croydon School of Art]] and [[Buckinghamshire New University|Buckinghamshire Chilterns University College]] (now Buckinghamshire New University). During the late 1990s he became a stand-up comedian, through which he met Barratt, with whom he established the Mighty Boosh. Together, the pair produced a 2001 radio series, ''[[The Boosh (radio series)|The Boosh]]'', for [[BBC Radio London]]. This was followed by a television series, ''[[The Mighty Boosh (TV series)|The Mighty Boosh]]'', producing three series for [[BBC 3]] from 2004 to 2007. The show generated a [[cult following|cult fan following]] and won a variety of awards.

During the 2000s, he also had smaller roles in a number of comedy shows for [[Channel 4]] including ''[[Nathan Barley]]'', ''[[The IT Crowd]]'', ''[[AD/BC: A Rock Opera]]'' and ''[[Garth Marenghi's Darkplace]]''. After ''The Mighty Boosh'', he wrote and starred in two series of a solo show for Channel 4, ''[[Noel Fielding's Luxury Comedy]]'', between 2012 and 2014. He also moved into other television avenues, appearing as himself; from 2009 to 2015, he appeared as a team captain on the [[BBC Two]] music/comedy panel show ''[[Never Mind the Buzzcocks]]'', and since 2017 has co-presented ''[[The Great British Bake Off]]'' with [[Sandi Toksvig]].

Aside from his comedic and television work, Fielding has also exhibited his paintings in London. He is the founder of the band [[Loose Tapestries]], formed with [[Kasabian]]'s [[Sergio Pizzorno]]. He has also starred as a guest in [[Richard Ayoade]]'s "Travel Man" series.

== Career ==

=== Stand-up comedy ===
Fielding performed regularly as a [[stand-up comedian]] during the late 1990s, and appeared repeatedly on the television stand-up showcase [[Lee Mack]]'s ''Gas''.  His highly animated stand-up routine included surreal stories, physical comedy, characters, and songs, much like his later work in ''The Mighty Boosh''.

In 2010, Fielding was to perform a solo tour across the country. It was cancelled, however, so he could concentrate on writing ''The Mighty Boosh'' film with Julian Barratt and creating an album. Fielding announced via [[Twitter]] that he was too busy to do the tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2009/11/12/9942/noel_fielding_cancels_tour|title=Noel Fielding cancels tour|author=Powder Blue Internet Business Solutions|work=chortle.co.uk|accessdate=24 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2015, Fielding told the Guardian that the film was something he talked about writing with Barratt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/apr/13/noel-fielding-on-going-solo-and-the-mighty-boosh-id-love-to-do-a-film|title=Noel Fielding on going solo and The Mighty Boosh: 'I'd love to do a film'|first=Oliver|last=Milman|date=12 April 2015|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The album was released in June 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2016/06/08/25042/noel_fieldings_album_released|title=Noel Fielding's album released : News 2016 : Chortle : The UK Comedy Guide|first=Powder Blue Internet Business|last=Solutions|website=www.chortle.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Fielding took part in ''[[Channel 4's Comedy Gala]]'', a [[Benefit concert|benefit show]] held in aid of [[Great Ormond Street Hospital|Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital]] and filmed live at the [[The O2 Arena (London)|O2 Arena]] in London on 30 March. He took part of the same event in 2014 as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thevelvetonion.com/2014/04/22/noel-fielding-added-to-comedy-gala/|title=Noel Fielding Added To Comedy Gala|date=22 April 2014|work=The Velvet Onion|accessdate=13 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''The Mighty Boosh'' ===
{{Main|The Mighty Boosh}}

[[File:Noel Fielding.jpg|thumb|right|Fielding in 2006]]
Fielding is best known for playing the role of Vince Noir, a childlike eccentric, opposite [[Julian Barratt]] ([[Howard Moon]]) in the cult comedy series ''The Mighty Boosh''.

Fielding met Barratt when he was performing a gig. Impressed by Fielding's skill, Barratt offered him a place to perform, and the two went on to form a partnership. Barratt and Fielding are said to have compared their relationship to a marriage; the character of Vince Noir is a kind, somewhat naive and loyal friend to the self-centred, neurotic and ambitious Howard Moon. Vince can talk to animals, earning him the nickname "[[Mowgli]] in [[Bell-bottoms|Flares]]". Vince is vibrant and flamboyant, contrasting with his friend Howard, who is more like a "geography teacher from [[Leeds]]".

As well as Noir, Fielding plays various supporting characters in the Mighty Boosh, including: [[Tony Harrison (Mighty Boosh)|Tony Harrison]], a small pink [[head]] with tentacles and member of the shaman council; [[The Hitcher (character)|The Hitcher]], a [[cockney]] hitch-hiker with a [[polo mint]] for an eye; The Moon; Spider Dijon, a bongoist in Rudi's band; and [[Old Gregg]], a hermaphroditic merman obsessed with [[Baileys Irish Cream]] and [[watercolor painting|watercolours]].

''The Mighty Boosh'' has won the Shockwaves NME Best TV Award three times: in 2007, 2008, and 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nme.com/news/music/mighty-wah-1352051|title=The Mighty Boosh wins Best TV show at Shockwaves NME Awards - NME|date=1 March 2007|work=NME|accessdate=13 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Television ===
Outside his work on ''The Mighty Boosh'', Fielding has also had bit parts in many of [[Channel 4]]'s somewhat off-beat comedy programmes, including ''[[Nathan Barley]]'', ''[[The IT Crowd]]'', ''[[AD/BC: A Rock Opera]]'' and ''[[Garth Marenghi's Darkplace]]'', more often than not appearing alongside [[Julian Barratt]]. He also appeared in 1998 sketch show ''[[Unnatural Acts (1998 TV Series)|Unnatural Acts]]''. In February 2007, Fielding appeared on ''[[Never Mind the Buzzcocks]]'' as a panellist, before going on to become a permanent team captain. Fielding also made a short appearance in the film ''[[Plunkett &amp; Macleane]]'' as a bystander to [[Robert Carlyle]]'s scuffle in a brothel. Fielding appeared on ''The [[Charlotte Church]] Show'' as a special guest.

[[File:BB28712@THE MIGHTY BOOSH.jpg|thumb|left|Fielding on the set of ''The Mighty Boosh'' television series]]

At [[Bill Bailey]]'s request, Fielding stood in as a team captain for three episodes during Season 21 of ''Never Mind the Buzzcocks''. He also achieved a record for the highest team score ever on the show. When Bailey returned, presenter [[Simon Amstell]] made various jokes about Fielding's departure. In 2009, Bailey left the show and Fielding became one of the regular team captains. According to [[Neil Gaiman]]'s [[blog]], Fielding was scheduled to appear in the film ''[[Stardust (2007 film)|Stardust]]'', but had to drop out due to ill health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://journal.neilgaiman.com/2006/09/stardust-news.html|title=Stardust news...|website=journal.neilgaiman.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also participated twice with [[Russell Brand]] in 2006 and 2007 on the annual quiz show ''[[The Big Fat Quiz of the Year]]''. He participated again in 2010, 2013 and 2017 with [[Richard Ayoade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2010/10/29/12026/noel_fieldings_new_show |title=Noel Fielding's new show : News 2010 : Chortle : The UK Comedy Guide |publisher=Chortle |date=29 October 2010 |accessdate=13 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/big_fat_quiz_of_the_year/episodes/1/8/ |title=The Big Fat Quiz of the Year – Episode 1.8.

In 2008, Fielding appeared with comic partner Julian Barratt on ''[[Transmission (TV series)|Transmission]]''. As usual, he wore a somewhat flamboyant attire, this time featuring [[High-heeled footwear#Men and heels|Cuban heels]] and [[polka dot]] trousers.

In 2009, he helped host ''[[Comic Relief]] Does [[Top of the Pops]]'' with [[Reggie Yates]] and [[Fearne Cotton]].

Fielding played the role of "Marcus" in the series 3 of ''[[How Not to Live Your Life]]'', which was broadcast in November 2010.

In 2011, he took part of Catherine Tate's TV movie ''Laughing at the Noughties'' in which he and other British comedians discussed the comedy highlights of the noughties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4wb1AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA557&amp;lpg=PA557&amp;dq=Noel+Fielding+took+part+in+Channel+4's+Comedy+Gala&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=En6RByYXIr&amp;sig=B1XWTU-hnh6tp-ukj8qEWFspR5s&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Noel%20Fielding%20took%20part%20in%20Channel%204's%20Comedy%20Gala&amp;f=false|title=Doctor Who-Guide 2/3|last=Googelberg|first=Compiled from Wikipedia pages and published by Dr|publisher=Lulu.com|year=|isbn=9781291079807|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fielding produced his first solo series for the Channel 4 network's [[E4 (channel)|E4]] channel in 2011,&lt;ref name="e4.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e4.com/blog/e4-blog/post/cwdcyqqdpcaifhrfbxogoo/view.e4 |title=Noel Fielding joins E4 – E4 blog |publisher=E4.com |date=29 October 2010 |accessdate=13 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123150704/http://www.e4.com/blog/e4-blog/post/cwdcyqqdpcaifhrfbxogoo/view.e4 |archivedate=23 November 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; as the broadcaster invests an additional £5 million in its comedy budget following the cancellation of reality show ''[[Big Brother (TV series)|Big Brother]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/tv-radio/heard-the-one-about-channel-4-2119328.html | location=London | work=The Independent | title=Heard the one about Channel 4? | date=29 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fielding said of the project, tentatively titled ''Noel Fielding: Boopus'': "I want to make something in the spirit of [[Spike Milligan]] or [[Kenny Everett#The Kenny Everett Television Show (BBC 1981–1988)|the Kenny Everett Show]] but using modern techniques. Blending filmed comedy with animation. Television needs a madman! I want the show to be psychedelic and beautiful but have charm and personality. If [[Salvador Dalí|Dalí]] made a show hopefully it would look like this."&lt;ref name="e4.com" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/oct/29/the-inbetweeners-specials?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487 | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=John | last=Plunkett | title=The Inbetweeners to return for two specials | date=29 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show has since been renamed ''[[Noel Fielding's Luxury Comedy]]'' and began broadcasting on Channel 4's E4 channel on 26 January 2012. It contained many aspects of animation composed with live action. A video shown to a select audience of C4 staff, producers, writers, performers and journalists showed the Boosh star as a stingray, discussing the recording of albums. Similar to the Mighty Boosh, in Luxury Comedy Fielding plays a wide array of characters including an optimistic lion, a chocolate finger, a deranged clown, a New York cop, a music producer stingray, and a futuristic Don Quixote called Fantasy Man. {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Fielding performed a dance to "[[Wuthering Heights]]" by [[Kate Bush]] for ''[[Let's Dance for Comic Relief]]'' reaching the finale. He has also appeared in a Kate Bush video for the remix version of "[[Deeper Understanding]]".

In March 2017 it was revealed that Fielding would co-host the upcoming series of ''[[The Great British Bake Off]]'' alongside [[Sandi Toksvig]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/great-british-bake-off-207-hosts-judges-noel-fielding-to-co-host-the-new-channel-4-series-a7633946.html|title=Noel Fielding to co-host Great British Bake Off on Channel 4|date=16 March 2017|work=The Independent|accessdate=13 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fielding appeared as a contestant on Series 4 of the [[Dave (TV channel)|Dave]] comedy panel game ''[[Taskmaster (TV series)|Taskmaster]]'' in 2017, hosted by [[Greg Davies]] and [[Alex Horne]]: he was the overall series winner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/uk/tv/taskmaster/44706/taskmaster-one-of-tvs-funniest-most-unexpected-comedies|title=Taskmaster: one of TV's funniest, most unexpected comedies|work=Den of Geek|accessdate=13 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.express.co.uk/life-style/life/892756/Taskmaster-Bake-Off-Noel-Fielding-Greg-Davies-Alex-Horne-Channel-Dave|title=Taskmaster: Greg Davies and Alex Horne give insight into the quirky show's success|last=Stephenson|first=David|date=17 December 2017|work=Express.co.uk|accessdate=13 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned for a Taskmaster: Champion of Champions series in December, in which he came fourth.

In January 2018, he was a panellist on ''[[QI]]'' alongside Russel Brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/qi/episodes/15/12/|title=QI Series O, Episode 12 - The Occult - British Comedy Guide|last=Guide|first=British Comedy|website=British Comedy Guide|accessdate=13 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Radio ===
Fielding starred in the 2001 ''[[The Mighty Boosh (Radio series)|Mighty Boosh radio series]]'' as Vince Noir and other characters. It was broadcast on [[BBC London 94.9|BBC London Live]]. He also appeared on ''[[Russell Brand|The Russell Brand Show]]'' on [[BBC Radio 2]] on 26 May 2007 and 13 October 2007, and Team Disgusting's show on Life fm as a co-host for one episode, along with fellow Team Disgusting members Melvis and Birdy.

In November 2007, Fielding starred in five episodes of [[BBC Radio 2]] show ''[[Vic Reeves' House Arrest]]'' as a local vagrant who knocks on Reeves' door once a week to ask for work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/comedy/vicreeves.shtml|title=BBC – Radio 2 Comedy – Vic Reeves' House Arrest|first=|last=BBC|website=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; His character is often given seemingly pointless tasks, such as building a galleon out of sausages, and is paid in small change.

=== Music ===
{{BLP unsourced section|date=May 2013}}
Fielding has appeared in several music videos, including [[Mint Royale]]'s "Blue Song", alongside [[Julian Barratt]], [[Nick Frost]] and [[Michael Smiley]]. He also made a brief appearance in the video for [[Razorlight]]'s "[[In the Morning (Razorlight song)|In the Morning]]". He appeared in music videos for the [[Robots in Disguise]] songs "Girl" (alongside [[Chris Corner]] who was, at the time, boyfriend to [[Sue Denim (musician)|Sue Denim]]), "The Tears", and "Turn It Up". In 2009, Noel was involved in the [[Kasabian]] video "Vlad the Impaler", in which he plays the titular character, and he's referenced in "La Fée Verte" (his friend [[Sergio Pizzorno]] said "The line, 'I met Dalí in the street.' Dalí is Noel Fielding. And he is the modern-day Dalí"). Fielding also makes a brief appearance as Vlad in the video for another Kasabian song, "[[Re-Wired]]", riding a five-seater bicycle with the band, and appears as a patient in a psychiatric hospital in "You're In Love With a Psycho", in which he re-enacts the broken mirror routine from the Marx Brothers film ''[[Duck Soup (1933 film)|''Duck Soup'']]'' with Pizzorno and Tom Meighan. He has also appeared in Kate Bush's music video "Deeper Understanding" as a means of thanks for the ''Let's Dance for Comic Relief'' performance.

Fielding is friends with the members of Razorlight, and involved them in the "[[The Priest and the Beast|Priest and the Beast]]" episode of ''The Mighty Boosh''. Fielding lent his voice to the [[Midfield General]] song "Midfielding". Fielding also sometimes plays bass live for Robots in Disguise. Furthermore, he has been known to DJ, often playing at [[Barfly (club)|The Barfly]] in London with the rest of [[The Mighty Boosh]] or with his DJ collective known as Team Disgusting, made up of six women and the Rev (formerly of [[Towers of London (band)|Towers of London]]). Lately, he has been DJing with [[Dave Brown (comedian)|Dave Brown]], who plays [[List of recurring characters from The Mighty Boosh#Bollo|Bollo]] in ''The Mighty Boosh'', under the DJing phenomenon, the Doctor and the Pencil, who first appeared in the Boosh episode "The Chokes".

Fielding is half of ''[[Loose Tapestries]]'', a comedy music partnership with [[Kasabian]]'s [[Sergio Pizzorno]], set up to create music for ''[[Noel Fielding's Luxury Comedy]]''.

He held his first exhibition, entitled ''Psychedelic Dreams of the Jelly Fox'', at Maison Bertaux, a patisserie in [[Greek Street]], [[Soho]] in early 2008. He claimed that he was inspired by [[Henri Rousseau]], [[René Magritte]], [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Roy Lichtenstein]], and [[Dexter Dalwood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hooliganartdealer.com/hooliganartdealer/Noel_Fielding.html | publisher=The Guardian | accessdate=27 June 2010 | title=Noel Fielding's life of Bryan }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has stated that he has been heavily influenced by the works of [[Salvador Dalí]]. A second exhibition entitled "Bryan Ferry vs the Jelly Fox" took place at Maison Bertaux, from 5 July 2010 through to 5 January 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2010/jun/27/noel-fielding-maison-bertaux-ferry | publisher=Hooligan Art Dealer | accessdate=1 January 2016 | title=Noel Fielding – Artist }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 September 2011, Fielding received honorary master's degrees from Buckinghamshire New University for his ongoing interest in the graphics area and support for many art organisations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://bucks.ac.uk/content/newsroom/2011/noelfielding | publisher=Bucks New University | accessdate=10 September 2010 | title=Mighty Boosh stars back at university to receive honorary master's degrees | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150911055600/http://bucks.ac.uk/content/newsroom/2011/noelfielding | archivedate=11 September 2015 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In October 2011, Fielding released an art book called 'Scribblings of a Madcap Shambleton', which he produced alongside with ''The Mighty Boosh'' cast member, [[Dave Brown (comedian)|Dave Brown]]. It features many of his old and new paintings, drawings and photography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/interactive/2011/nov/18/noel-fielding-the-scribblings-of-a-madcap-shambleton | publisher=The Guardian | accessdate=18 November 2011 | title=Noel Fielding: The Scribblings of a Madcap Shambleton }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fielding's video installation of 'The Jelly Fox' was shown at the Saatchi Gallery, and in 2012 he created a unique piece inspired by The Beatles for Liverpool Love at the Museum of Liverpool. In March 2015, his exhibition 'He Wore Dreams Around Unkind Faces' was shown at the Royal Albert Hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.royalalberthall.com/about-the-hall/news/2015/march/the-mighty-brush-behind-the-scenes-at-noel-fieldings-new-exhibition | accessdate=1 February 2016 | title=The Mighty Brush: Behind the scenes at Noel Fielding's new exhibition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fielding was educated at [[Croydon College|Croydon School of Art]] in [[South London]] then studied for a BA in Graphic Design and Advertising at [[Buckinghamshire Chilterns University College]] (now [[Buckinghamshire New University]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jones|first=Sam|title=He's a Mick Jagger of comedy ... sweet but unbelievably mischievous and naughty, like a very cheeky puppy|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/dec/14/comedy.arts|date=14 December 2007|accessdate=18 October 2014|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[High Wycombe]], where he lived with friends and future collaborators [[Dave Brown (comedian)|Dave Brown]] and [[Nigel Coan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Man Who Brings Noel's Dreams to Life|url=http://thevelvetonion.com/2012/01/23/the-man-who-brings-noels-dreams-to-life/|publisher=The Velvet Onion|accessdate=28 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Well-known TV stars to be among honorary graduates at Buckinghamshire New University|url=http://bucks.ac.uk/content/newsroom/2011/tvgraduates#.VDHTHSldVnI|accessdate=5 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006113026/http://bucks.ac.uk/content/newsroom/2011/tvgraduates#.VDHTHSldVnI|archivedate=6 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fielding has also shared a flat in Edinburgh with comedians [[Lee Mack]], [[Julian Barratt]] and [[Simon Evans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/info/press/news/an-interview-with-noel-fielding|title=An interview with Noel Fielding – Channel 4 – Info – Press|website=www.channel4.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, a ''Sunday Times'' article revealed that Fielding had [[hepatitis]] during his art college years and later revealed he was helped through this by friend and collaborator Nigel Coan. This forced him not to drink for six months which got him into the habit of not drinking for a couple of years. "I used to be able to enjoy myself with just nothing. I'd stay up till four in the morning, with everyone else being drunk. Just make a bit of effort and you can get used to it."&lt;ref name="Sunday Times" /&gt;

He was named one of ''[[GQ]]''{{'}}s 50 best dressed British men in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=50 Best Dressed Men in Britain 2015 |url=http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/style/articles/2015-01/05/best-dressed-men-2015/ |work=GQ |date=5 January 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150107145128/http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/style/articles/2015-01/05/best-dressed-men-2015 |archivedate=7 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
