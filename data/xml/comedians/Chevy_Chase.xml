'''Cornelius Crane "Chevy" Chase''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|tʃ|ɛ|v|i}}; born October 8, 1943) is an American actor, comedian and writer.

Born into a prominent [[New York (state)|New York]] family, Chase worked a variety of jobs before moving into comedy and began acting with ''[[National Lampoon (magazine)|National Lampoon]]''. He became a key cast member in the first season of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', where his recurring ''[[Weekend Update]]'' segment soon became a staple of the show. As both a performer and writer, he earned three [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s out of five nominations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chevy Chase|url=http://www.emmys.com/bios/chevy-chase|publisher=Emmys.com|access-date=June 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chase had his first leading film role in the comedy ''[[Foul Play (1978 film)|Foul Play]]'' (1978), earning two [[Golden Globe Award]] nominations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Golden Globe Awards for 'Chevy Chase'|url=http://www.goldenglobes.com/person/chevy-chase|publisher=Goldenglobes.com|access-date=June 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is further known for his portrayals of [[National Lampoon's Vacation (film series)|Clark Griswold]] in five ''[[National Lampoon's Vacation (film series)|National Lampoon's Vacation]]'' films and Irwin "Fletch" Fletcher in both ''[[Fletch (film)|Fletch]]'' (1985) and ''[[Fletch Lives]]'' (1989). Other prominent titles include ''[[Caddyshack]]'' (1980), ''[[Seems Like Old Times (film)|Seems Like Old Times]]'' (1980), ''[[Spies Like Us]]'' (1985), ''[[Three Amigos]]'' (1986), ''[[Memoirs of an Invisible Man (film)|Memoirs of an Invisible Man]]'' (1992), ''[[Orange County (film)|Orange County]]'' (2002) and ''[[Hot Tub Time Machine]]'' (2010). He has hosted the [[Academy Awards]] twice ([[59th Academy Awards|1987]] and [[60th Academy Awards|1988]]) and briefly had his own late-night talk show, ''[[The Chevy Chase Show]]'' (1993). He played the character [[List of Community characters#Pierce Hawthorne|Pierce Hawthorne]] on the [[NBC]] comedy series ''[[Community (TV series)|Community]]'' from 2009 to 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uproxx.com/tv/2012/11/chevy-chase-is-leaving-community/|title=Chevy Chase is leaving "Community"|work=Uproxx.com|last=Guerrero|first=Danger|date=November 21, 2012|access-date=November 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deadline.com/2012/11/chevy-chase-leaving-nbcs-community/|title=Chevy Chase Leaving NBC's "Community"|work=Deadline.com|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|date=November 21, 2012|access-date=November 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
=== Family ===
Cornelius Crane Chase was born on October 8, 1943&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chevy Chase biography|url=http://www.biography.com/people/chevy-chase-9542517|publisher=Biography.com|access-date=October 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Lower Manhattan|Lower Manhattan, New York]], and grew up in [[Woodstock, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/arts/tv/profiles/48252/|title=Is Chevy Chase a Potential Successor to Johnny Carson?&amp;nbsp;— New York Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Edward Tinsley "Ned" Chase, was a prominent Manhattan book editor and magazine writer. His mother, Cathalene Parker (''née'' Browning), was a [[Pianist|concert pianist]] and [[Libretto|librettist]] whose own father [[Rear admiral (United States)|Admiral]] [[Miles Browning]] served as Rear Admiral [[Raymond A. Spruance]]'s Chief of Staff on the aircraft carrier [[USS Enterprise (CV-6)|USS ''Enterprise'' (CV-6)]] at the [[Battle of Midway]] in [[World War II]]. Cathalene was adopted as a child by her stepfather, [[Cornelius Vanderbilt Crane]], heir to [[Crane Co.|The Crane Company]], and took the name Cathalene Crane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1962/07/11/archives/explorers-survivor-omitted.html | work=The New York Times | title=Explorer's Survivor Omitted | date=July 11, 1962}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chase's paternal grandfather was artist and illustrator [[Edward Leigh Chase]], and his great-uncle was painter and teacher [[Frank Swift Chase]]. His maternal grandmother, Cathalene, was an opera singer who performed several times at [[Carnegie Hall]].&lt;ref name="BurginHoltz2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Martha Burgin|author2=Maureen Holtz|title=Robert Allerton: the private man &amp; the public gifts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eWgmAQAAMAAJ|year=2009|publisher=The News-Gazette|page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chase was named for his adoptive grandfather [[Cornelius Vanderbilt Crane]], while the nickname "Chevy" was bestowed by his grandmother, derived from the medieval English ''[[The Ballad of Chevy Chase|Ballad of Chevy Chase]]''. As a descendant of the Scottish [[Clan Douglas]], the name seemed appropriate to her.&lt;ref name="I'm Chevy Chase...and You're Not" /&gt; He is a 14th-generation New Yorker, and was listed in the ''[[Social Register]]'' at an early age. His mother's ancestors arrived in Manhattan starting in 1624&amp;nbsp;— among his ancestors are New York City mayors [[Stephanus Van Cortlandt]] and [[John Johnstone (mayor)|John Johnstone]]; the Dutch [[Schuyler family]], through his ancestor Gertrude Schuyler, the wife of Stephanus Van Cortlandt; [[John Morin Scott]], General of the New York Militia during the [[American Revolution]]; [[Anne Hutchinson]], dissident [[Puritans|Puritan]] preacher and [[Alternative medicine|healer]]; and ''[[Mayflower]]'' passengers and signers of the [[Mayflower Compact]] from England, [[John Howland]],&lt;ref&gt;Cornelius Crane "Chevy" Chase, Edward Tinsley "Ned" Chase, Edward Leigh Chase, Charles Dennison Chase, Henry Seymour Chase, Jarvis Brown Chase, Paul Chase m. Betty Kinnicutt, John Kinnicutt m. Hannah Gorham, Jabez Gorham, Jr., Jabez Gorham, Sr., John Gorham m. Desire Howland, daughter of John Howland &amp; Elizabeth Tilley.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Pilgrim colonist leader and spiritual elder of the [[Plymouth Colony]], [[William Brewster (Mayflower passenger)|William Brewster]]. According to his brother John:

{{cquote|[Chevy] once told me that people who defined themselves in terms of their ancestry were like potatoes—the best parts of them were underground. He disdained the pretension of my mother's side of the family, as embodied by her mother, Cattie.&lt;ref name="I'm Chevy Chase...and You're Not" /&gt;}}

As a child, Chase vacationed at [[Castle Hill (Ipswich, Massachusetts)|Castle Hill]], the Cranes' summer estate in [[Ipswich, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name="LLC1993"&gt;{{cite book|author=New York Media, LLC|title=New York Magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zCYAAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA32|date=August 23, 1993|publisher=New York Media, LLC|page=32|issn=0028-7369}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chase's parents divorced when he was four; his father remarried into the [[Folgers]] coffee family, and his mother remarried twice. He has stated that he grew up in an [[upper middle class]] environment and that his adoptive maternal grandfather did not bequeath any assets to Chase's mother when he died.&lt;ref name="stern918"&gt;Chase, Chevy, interview on ''Howard Stern Show'', Sirius Satellite Radio, September 18, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2007 biography, Chase stated that he was physically and psychologically [[child abuse|abused]] as a child by his mother and stepfather, John Cederquist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2007/04/24/us-chase-biography-idUSN2333396920070424|title=Chevy Chase says in book he was beaten by mother|publisher=Reuters |date=April 24, 2007|access-date=August 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both his parents died in 2005.

=== Education and music ===
Chase was educated at [[Riverdale Country School]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jarvis |first=Jeff |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20085892,00.html |title=Chevy Chase's New High: Fatherhood |publisher=People.com |date= |access-date=2015-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  an [[independent school|independent]] day school in the [[Riverdale, Bronx|Riverdale]] neighborhood of New York City, before being expelled. He ultimately graduated from the [[Stockbridge School]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=M9oVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ARMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2217,6446264&amp;dq=stockbridge+school&amp;hl=en|title=The Milwaukee Sentinel&amp;nbsp;— Google News Archive Search}}&lt;/ref&gt; an independent boarding school in the town of [[Stockbridge, Massachusetts|Stockbridge]], [[Massachusetts]]. He then attended [[Haverford College]] during the 1962–1963 term, where he was noted for [[slapstick]] comedy and an absurd sense of physical humor (including his signature pratfalls and "sticking forks into his orifices"&lt;ref name="biconews.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biconews.com/2003/10/28/prankly-speaking/ |title=biconews.com |publisher=biconews.com |date=October 28, 2003 |access-date=2015-02-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150421202900/http://www.biconews.com/2003/10/28/prankly-speaking/ |archivedate=April 21, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;). During a 2009 interview on the ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]]'' show, he ostensibly verified the oft-publicized [[urban legend]] that he was [[Expulsion (education)|expelled]] for harboring a cow in his fourth floor room,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.haverford.edu/haverblog/2009/10/08/happy-birthday-chevy-about-that-cow/ |title=blogs.haverford.edu |publisher=blogs.haverford.edu |date= |access-date=2015-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; although his former roommate David Felson asserted in a 2003 interview that Chase left for academic reasons.&lt;ref name="biconews.com" /&gt; Chase transferred to [[Bard College]] in [[Annandale-on-Hudson, New York]], where he studied a [[Pre-medical|pre-med curriculum]] and graduated in 1967 with a Bachelor of Arts in English.

Chase did not enter [[medical school]], which meant he would be subject to [[Conscription in the United States#Vietnam War|the military draft]]. Chase was not drafted; when he appeared in January 1989 as the first guest of the just-launched [[The Pat Sajak Show|late-night ''Pat Sajak Show'']], he said he had convinced his draft board he deserved a [[Selective Service System#Classifications|4-F classification]] by "falsely claiming, among other things, that he had homosexual tendencies".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/11/arts/review-television-late-night-chitchat-additions-pat-sajak-and-arsenio-hall.html?pagewanted=print Late-Night Chitchat Additions: Pat Sajak and Arsenio Hall], a January 11, 1989 review from ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Chase played drums with the college band The Leather Canary, headed by school friends [[Walter Becker]] and [[Donald Fagen]]. Chase has called the group "a bad [[jazz]] band"; Becker and Fagen later founded the successful group [[Steely Dan]]. Chase has [[absolute pitch]].&lt;ref name="I'm Chevy Chase...and You're Not"&gt;Fruchter, Rena. ''I'm Chevy Chase...and You're Not''. Virgin Books, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; He played drums and keyboards for a rock band called [[Chamaeleon Church]], which recorded one album for [[MGM Records]] before disbanding in 1969. To give the album a more soft-rock sound, producer [[Alan Lorber]] made several alterations in the mixing, including the muting of Chase's bass drum, and Chase was reportedly incensed when he heard the final mix.&lt;ref&gt;Joynson, Vernon (1995).

London: Borderline Books. See entry on Chamaeleon Church.&lt;/ref&gt; Before fame, Chase worked as a cab driver, truck driver, motorcycle messenger, construction worker, waiter, busboy, fruit picker, produce manager in a supermarket, audio engineer, salesman in a wine store, and theater usher.

==Career==
=== Early career ===
Chase was a member of an early underground comedy ensemble called ''Channel One'' which he co-founded in 1967. He also wrote a one-page spoof on ''[[Mission: Impossible]]'' for ''[[Mad (magazine)|MAD]]'' magazine in 1970 and was a writer for the short-lived ''[[Smothers Brothers]]'' TV show comeback in the spring of 1975. Chase made the move to comedy as a full-time career by 1973, when he became a cast member of ''[[The National Lampoon Radio Hour]]'', a syndicated satirical radio series. The ''Lampoon Radio Hour'' also featured [[John Belushi]], [[Gilda Radner]], [[Bill Murray]], and [[Brian Doyle-Murray]], all of whom later became "Not-Ready-For-Prime Time Players" on ''NBC Saturday Night'' (later retitled ''NBC's Saturday Night'' and finally ''Saturday Night Live''). Chase and Belushi also appeared in National Lampoon's [[off-Broadway]] revue ''[[Lemmings (National Lampoon)|Lemmings]]'', a sketch and musical send-up of popular [[youth culture]] (in which Chase also played the drums and piano during the musical numbers). He appeared in the theatrical release ''[[The Groove Tube]]'' which was directed by another co-founder of ''Channel One'', [[Ken Shapiro]], featuring several ''Channel One'' sketches.

=== ''Saturday Night Live'' ===
[[Image:Chevy Chase 1976.jpg|thumb|Chevy Chase at the private party after the premiere of the movie ''[[A Star Is Born (1976 film)|A Star is Born]]'', December 1976]]
Chase was one of the original cast members of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (''SNL''), [[NBC]]'s late-night comedy television show, beginning in October 1975. During the first season, he introduced every show except two with, "Live from New York, it's ''Saturday Night!''" The remark was often preceded by a [[wikt:Special:Search/pratfall|pratfall]], known as "The Fall of the Week". Chase became known for his skill at [[physical comedy]]. In one [[sketch comedy|comedy sketch]], he mimicked a real-life incident in which President [[Gerald Ford]] accidentally tripped while disembarking from [[Air Force One]] in [[Salzburg]], [[Austria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chase's physical stunts led to at least one self-injury.

Chase was the original anchor for the ''[[Weekend Update]]'' segment of ''SNL'', and his catchphrase introduction, "I'm Chevy Chase... and you're not" became well known. His trademark conclusion, "Good night, and have a pleasant tomorrow" was later resurrected by [[Jane Curtin]] and [[Tina Fey]]. Chase also wrote comedy material for ''Weekend Update.'' For example, he wrote and performed "The News for the Hard of Hearing". In this skit, Chase would read the top story of the day, aided by [[Garrett Morris]], who would repeat the story by loudly shouting it. Chase claimed that his version of ''Weekend Update'' would later be the inspiration for other [[news satire]] shows such as ''[[The Daily Show]]'' and ''[[The Colbert Report]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aoltv.com/2007/04/16/a-delusional-chevy-chase-says-he-created-the-daily-show/|title=A delusional Chevy Chase says he created The Daily Show|website=AOL TV|first=Joel|last=Keller|date=April 16, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518094259/http://www.aoltv.com/2007/04/16/a-delusional-chevy-chase-says-he-created-the-daily-show/|archivedate=May 18, 2015|quote=[...] asked what he thought of Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert, [Chase] took credit for their success.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; a short-lived late-night talk-show produced by Chase and broadcast by [[Fox Broadcasting Company]].)

Chase also performed in other skits on ''SNL'' including a recurring role as the [[Land Shark (Saturday Night Live)|Land Shark]], a parody of the blockbuster movie ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]''. His racially charged "word association" skit opposite [[Richard Pryor]] from ''SNL's'' first season is frequently cited by television critics as one of the funniest (and most daring) skits in the show's history.

Chase was committed contractually to ''SNL'' for only one year as a writer, and became a cast member during rehearsals just before the show's premiere.  He received two [[Emmy Award]]s and a [[Golden Globe Award]] for his comedy writing and live comic acting on the show.  In ''[[Rolling Stone]]''&amp;apos;s February 2015 appraisal of all 141 ''SNL'' cast members to date, Chase was ranked tenth in overall importance.  "Strange as it sounds, Chase might be the most ''under''-rated ''SNL'' player," they wrote.  "It took him only one season to define the franchise&amp;nbsp;... without that [[deadpan]] arrogance, the whole ''SNL'' style of humor would fall flat."&lt;ref&gt;''Rolling Stone'', issue 1229, February 26, 2015, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1975 ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine cover story, which called him "The funniest man in America", NBC executives referred to Chase as "The first real potential successor to [[Johnny Carson]]" and claimed he would begin guest-hosting ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' within six months of the article. Chase dismissed chatter that he could be the next Carson by telling ''New York'', "I'd never be tied down for five years interviewing TV personalities." In fact, Chase did not even appear on the program until May 4, 1977, when he was promoting a prime time special for NBC.

Chase acknowledged [[Ernie Kovacs]]' influence on his work in ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Chevy Chase, "The Unique Comedy of Ernie Kovacs," TV Guide, April 9, 1977, p. 39–40.&lt;/ref&gt; and he thanked Kovacs during his acceptance speech for his Emmy Award.&lt;ref&gt;Hofer, Stephen F.(2006). ''TV Guide: the official collector's guide'', Bangzoom Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Chase spoke of Kovacs' influence on his work in an appearance in the 1982 documentary called ''Ernie Kovacs: Television's Original Genius''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083898/|title=Ernie Kovacs: Television's Original Genius|date=November 17, 1982|publisher=Internet Movie Database}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Leaving ''SNL'' ====
In late 1976, in the middle of the second season, Chase became the first member of the original cast to leave the show.  While he landed starring roles in several films on the strength of his ''SNL'' notoriety, he asserted that the principal reason for his departure was his girlfriend Jacqueline Carlin's reluctance to move to New York.&lt;ref name="snl20050220"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Live From New York: The First 5 Years of Saturday Night Live | series =Saturday Night Live |network=NBC |airdate=February 20, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chase moved to Los Angeles, married Carlin, and was replaced by [[Bill Murray]], although he made a few appearances on the show during the second season.

Chase later hosted ''SNL'' eight times through 1997. He appeared on the show's 25th anniversary special in 1999, and was interviewed for a 2005 NBC special on the first five years of ''SNL''. Later appearances included a ''Caddyshack'' skit featuring Bill Murray, a 1997 episode with guest host [[Chris Farley]], as the Land Shark in a Weekend Update segment in 2001, another Weekend Update segment in 2007, and in Justin Timberlake's monologue in 2013 as a member of the [[List of Saturday Night Live guests#Five-Timers Club|Five-Timers Club]], where he was reunited with his ''Three Amigos'' co-stars [[Steve Martin]] and [[Martin Short]].  He also participated in the 40th anniversary special in February 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McCoy |first=Terrence |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/02/17/chevy-chase-after-saturday-night-live-too-mean-to-succeed/?hpid=z5 |title='&amp;#39;Chevy Chase, Too Mean To Succeed'&amp;#39; Washington Post 2015-02-17 |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date= |access-date=2015-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Film ===
[[Image:Chevy Chase 1980.jpg|thumb|Chevy Chase at the premiere of the movie ''[[Seems Like Old Times (film)|Seems Like Old Times]]'', December 10, 1980]]
Chase's early film roles included ''[[Tunnel Vision (1976 film)|Tunnel Vision]]'', the box office hit ''[[Foul Play (1978 film)|Foul Play]]'', and ''[[Oh! Heavenly Dog]]''. The role of Eric 'Otter' Stratton in ''[[Animal House|National Lampoon's Animal House]]'' was originally written with Chase in mind, but he turned the role down to work on ''Foul Play''.&lt;ref name="stern918" /&gt; The role went to [[Tim Matheson]] instead. Chase said in an interview that he chose to do ''Foul Play'' so he could do "real acting" for the first time in his career instead of just doing "schtick".&lt;ref name="Live From New York"&gt;Shales, Tom. ''Live From New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live''. Back Bay Books, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Chase followed ''Foul Play'' with the successful [[Harold Ramis]] comedy ''[[Caddyshack]]'', in 1980. That same year, he also reunited with ''Foul Play'' co-star [[Goldie Hawn]] for [[Neil Simon]]'s ''[[Seems Like Old Times (film)|Seems Like Old Times]]'' and released a self-titled record album, co-produced by Chase and Tom Scott, with novelty and cover versions of songs by [[Randy Newman]], [[Barry White]], [[Bob Marley]], [[the Beatles]], [[Donna Summer]], [[Tennessee Ernie Ford]], [[The Troggs]], and [[The Sugarhill Gang]].

Chase narrowly escaped death by [[electrocution]] during the filming of ''[[Modern Problems]]'' in 1980. During a sequence in which Chase's character wears "landing lights" as he dreams that he is an airplane, the lights malfunctioned and electrical current passed through Chase's arm, back, and neck muscles. The [[near-death experience]] caused Chase to experience a period of deep [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], as his marriage to Jacqueline had ended just prior to the start of filming. Chase continued his film career in 1983's ''[[National Lampoon's Vacation]]'', directed by Ramis and written by [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]]. He married Jayni Luke in 1982, and in 1985, he starred in ''[[Fletch (film)|Fletch]]'', the first of two films based on [[Gregory Mcdonald]]'s ''[[Fletch (novel)|Fletch]]'' books. Chase joined ''SNL'' veterans [[Steve Martin]] and [[Martin Short]] in the Lorne Michaels-produced comedy ''Three Amigos'' in 1986, declaring in an interview that making ''Three Amigos'' was the most fun he had making a film. The trio hosted ''SNL'' that year, the only time the show has had three hosts on one show.

At the height of his career in the late 1980s, Chase earned around US$7&amp;nbsp;million per film and was a highly visible celebrity. He appeared alongside [[Paul Simon]], one of his best friends, in Simon's 1986 second video for "[[You Can Call Me Al]]", in which he lip-syncs all of Simon's lyrics. Chase hosted the [[Academy Awards]] in 1987 and 1988, signing on to the proceedings in 1988 with the opener, "Good evening, Hollywood phonies!" Chase filmed a sequel to ''Vacation'', 1985's ''[[National Lampoon's European Vacation]]'' and then a third, ''[[National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation]]'', in 1989, which, thanks to its holiday theme, has become one of his more durable films, airing on [[NBC]] every December. He played saxophone onstage at Simon's free concert at the Great Lawn in [[Central Park]] in the summer of 1991. Later in 1991, he helped record and appeared in the music video "[[Voices That Care]]" to entertain and support U.S. troops involved in [[Gulf War|Operation Desert Storm]], and supported the [[International Committee of the Red Cross|International Red Cross]].

==== Later work ====
[[File:Gerald Ford and Chevy Chase.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Gerald Ford]] with Chase before the Conference on Humor and the Presidency held at the Gerald R. Ford Museum in 1986]]
Chase's career took a downturn in the early 1990s. Chase had three consecutive film flops&amp;nbsp;— 1991's [[Golden Raspberry Awards|Razzie award]]-nominated ''[[Nothing but Trouble (1991 film)|Nothing but Trouble]]'', 1992's ''[[Memoirs of an Invisible Man (film)|Memoirs of an Invisible Man]]'', and 1994's ''[[Cops &amp; Robbersons]]''. The three releases had a combined gross of $34&amp;nbsp;million in the United States. Even the durable ''Vacation'' series ground to a halt, following 1997's ''[[Vegas Vacation]]'' installment. Some of the more recent movies starring Chase (e.g., ''Vacuums'', ''[[Our Italian Husband|Rent-a-Husband]]'', ''Goose!'') have not been widely released in the United States. He returned to mainstream movie-making in 2006, co-starring with [[Tim Allen]] and [[Courteney Cox]] in the comedy ''[[Zoom (2006 film)|Zoom]]'', though it was both a critical and commercial failure.

In September 1993, Chase hosted ''[[The Chevy Chase Show]]'', a weeknight talk show, for the [[Fox Broadcasting Company]]. Though it had high commercial expectations, the show was cancelled by Fox after only five weeks. Chase later appeared in a commercial for [[Doritos]], airing during the [[Super Bowl]], in which he made humorous reference to the show's failure.

Chase was [[Hasty Pudding Theatricals|Hasty Pudding's]] 1993 Man of the Year, and received a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] in 1994. After having starred with [[Farrah Fawcett]] in the relatively successful ''[[Man of the House (1995 film)|Man of the House]]'' in 1995, he received [[The Harvard Lampoon]]'s Lifetime Achievement Award in 1996.

In 1998, a Golden Palm Star on the [[Palm Springs, California]], [[Palm Springs Walk of Stars|Walk of Stars]] was dedicated to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palmspringswalkofstars.com/web-storage/Stars/Stars%20dedicated%20by%20date.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013165655/http://www.palmspringswalkofstars.com/web-storage/Stars/Stars%20dedicated%20by%20date.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-10-13 |title=Palm Springs Walk of Stars by date dedicated |format=PDF |date= |access-date=2015-02-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was [[Roast (comedy)|roasted]] by the [[New York Friars Club]] for a [[Comedy Central]] television special in 2002. This roast was noted for being unusually vitriolic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Virginia Heffernan|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2074752/|title=Chevy Chase, humiliated again|publisher=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|date=December 2, 2002 |access-date=October 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only cast members of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'s'' [[Saturday Night Live (season 1)|first season]] who appeared at the roast were [[Laraine Newman]] (one of the actors on the show), [[Al Franken]], a bit player and writer on the show and eventually a [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]], and [[Paul Shaffer]] (a band leader on SNL in the 1970s and the host of the roast).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=DiGiacomo | first=Frank | date=October 7, 2002 | title=The Decline of Roman’s Empire | work=[[New York Observer]] | url=http://observer.com/2002/10/the-decline-of-romans-empire/ | access-date=September 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Chase was the keynote speaker at [[Princeton University]]'s Class Day, part of commencement activities.

On March 20, 2012, Dan Aykroyd announced through his Facebook page that he is working with Chase on a script for a new comedy that would star the two actors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chitwood|first1=Adam|title=Dan Aykroyd and Chevy Chase Are Writing a New Comedy Script|url=http://collider.com/dan-aykroyd-chevy-chase-new-comedy-movie/|access-date=June 19, 2015|work=Collider|date=March 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Chase reprised his role as Clark Griswold in the fifth ''Vacation'' installment, simply titled ''[[Vacation (2015 film)|Vacation]]''. Unlike the previous four films in which Clark is the main [[protagonist]], he only has a brief though pivotal cameo appearance. In spite of largely negative critical reception, the film itself has proven to be a financial success grossing over $104&amp;nbsp;million worldwide, making it the highest grossing entry to date.

=== Return to television ===
Chase [[Guest appearance|guest-star]]red as an [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] murder suspect in "[[Law &amp; Order (season 17)#ep378|In Vino Veritas]]", the November 3, 2006 episode of ''[[Law &amp; Order]]''. He also guest-starred in the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] drama series ''[[Brothers &amp; Sisters (2006 TV series)|Brothers &amp; Sisters]]'' in two episodes as a former love interest of [[Sally Field]]'s character. Chase appeared in a prominent recurring role as villainous software magnate [[Fulcrum (Chuck)|Ted Roark]] on the NBC spy-comedy ''[[Chuck (TV series)|Chuck]]''. In 2009, Chase and [[Dan Aykroyd]] provided voices for the ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode "[[Spies Reminiscent of Us]]".

Chase starred in the [[NBC]] sitcom ''[[Community (TV series)|Community]]'', as aging moist-towelette tycoon Pierce Hawthorne, starting in 2009. However, Chase left the show in 2012 after completing the majority of the episodes of Season 4. He returned for a cameo appearance in the Season 5 premiere. Though he had sometimes been involved in public disputes with creator [[Dan Harmon]] over the direction of the show, the role was nevertheless his most prominent in many years.

In 2010, he appeared in the film ''[[Hot Tub Time Machine]]'', as well as a short online film featuring the Griswold Family, and in the ''[[Funny or Die]]'' original comedy sketch "[[Presidential Reunion]]", where he played President Ford alongside other current and former ''SNL'' president impersonators.

==== Television commercials ====
Chase has appeared in a number of television commercials, including [[Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group|Dollar Rent-a-Car]] (1996), [[Doritos]] (1996), [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]] (1999), a series of commercials for [[AAMI]] Insurance (Australia, 1999),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AAMI Insurance TV commercial|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FM15f9b94r8|website=YouTube|access-date=January 12, 2016|ref=AAMI Insurance}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AAMI TV commercial|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j78w3diSKT8|website=YouTube|access-date=January 12, 2016|ref=AAMI insuarnce}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AAMI TV commercial|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pI_UEsxRlr0|website=YouTube|access-date=January 12, 2016|ref=AAMI Insurance}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aflac]] (2003), [[Cola Turka]] (2003), [[T-Mobile]] (2009) and [[Chase Bank|Chase Manhattan Bank]] (2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000331/otherworks|title=Chevy Chase&amp;nbsp;— Other works|work=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==

Chevy married Susan Hewitt on February 23, 1973, in [[New York City]]. They [[divorce]]d three years later, on February 1, 1976. His second marriage to Jacqueline Carlin was formalized on December 4, 1976. They divorced on November 14, 1980. He married his third and current wife, Jayni Luke, on June 19, 1982, in [[Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles]].

In 1986, Chase was admitted to the [[Betty Ford Center|Betty Ford Clinic]] for treatment of an addiction to prescription [[Analgesic|painkillers]]. His use of these drugs began after he experienced ongoing [[back pain]] related to the pratfalls he took during his ''Saturday Night Live'' appearances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/12/us/chevy-chase-being-treated-for-addiction-to-painkillers.html |newspaper=The New York Times | date=October 12, 1986 | title= Chevy Chase Being Treated For Addiction to Painkillers |access-date=August 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, he said that his drug abuse had been "low level".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.esquire.com/features/what-ive-learned/chevy-chase-interview-1010 |work=Esquire | title= Chevy Chase: What I've Learned  |date=September 23, 2010 |access-date=August 31, 2013| author=Fussman, Cal}}&lt;/ref&gt; He entered [[Minnesota]]'s [[Hazelden Foundation|Hazelden Clinic]] in September 2016 for treatment of an [[Alcohol abuse|alcohol-related issue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/06/entertainment/chevy-chase-rehab/index.html|title=Chevy Chase enters rehab|first=Lisa Respers France|last=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chase is an active [[environmentalism|environmentalist]], [[fundraising|charity fundraiser]], and [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]]. He raised money for [[Bill Clinton]] in the 1990s and [[John Kerry]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 Presidential Election]]. Following the 2004 elections, Chase criticized President [[George W. Bush]] during a speech at a [[People for the American Way]] benefit at the [[John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts]], referring to the President as an "uneducated, real lying schmuck" and a "dumb fuck". &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A3216-2004Dec15.html |title=It's the F-Time Show With Chevy Chase |publisher=washingtonpost.com |date=December 16, 2004 |access-date=August 8, 2011 |first=Richard |last=Leiby}}&lt;/ref&gt;
