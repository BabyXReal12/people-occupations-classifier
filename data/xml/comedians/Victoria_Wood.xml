'''Victoria Wood''', {{postnominals|country=GBR|size=100%|CBE}} (19 May 1953&amp;nbsp;– 20 April 2016) was an English comedian, actress, singer and songwriter, screenwriter, producer and director. Wood wrote and starred in dozens of sketches, plays, musicals, films and sitcoms over several decades, and her live comedy act was interspersed with her own compositions, which she performed on the piano. Much of her humour was grounded in everyday life and included references to quintessentially "British" activities, attitudes and products. She was noted for her skills in observing culture and in satirising social classes.&lt;ref name="Brandwood"&gt;{{cite book |last = Brandwood |first = Neil |title= Victoria Wood&amp;nbsp;– The Biography |edition = 1st |year = 2002 |publisher = Boxtree |location = London |isbn = 1-85227-982-6}}

Wood started her career in 1974 by appearing on the [[Associated Television|ATV]] talent show ''[[New Faces]]''. She established herself as a comedy star in the 1980s, winning a [[British Academy Television Award for Best Entertainment Performance|BAFTA TV Award]] in 1986 for the sketch series ''[[Victoria Wood as Seen on TV]]'' (1985–87), and became one of Britain's most popular stand-up comics,&lt;ref name="Brandwood" /&gt; winning a second BAFTA for ''[[An Audience with...|An Audience with Victoria Wood]]'' (1988). In the 1990s she wrote and co-starred in the television film ''[[Pat and Margaret]]'' (1994) and the sitcom ''[[Dinnerladies (TV series)|Dinnerladies]]'' (1998–2000).&lt;ref name="thecustard.tv"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thecustard.tv/shows/dinnerladies.html |title=The custard.tv guide to... dinnerladies |accessdate=2007-09-17 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410065003/http://www.thecustard.tv/shows/dinnerladies.html |archivedate=10 April 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; She won two more [[BAFTA TV Awards]], including [[British Academy Television Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]], for her 2006 [[ITV1]] television film, ''[[Housewife, 49]]''.&lt;ref name="Brandwood" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Screenonline" /&gt; Her frequent long-term collaborators included [[Julie Walters]], [[Celia Imrie]], [[Duncan Preston]], and  [[Anne Reid]].&lt;ref name="Brandwood" /&gt; In 2006, Wood came tenth in [[ITV (TV Network)|ITV]]'s poll of the British public's [[TV's 50 Greatest Stars|50 Greatest TV Stars]].

==Early years==

Victoria Wood was the youngest child of Stanley Wood, an insurance salesman, who also wrote songs for his company's Christmas parties,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Iley |first=Chrissy |date=12 June 2011 |title=Victoria Wood interview: 'I fear being my mother'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/theatre/actors/victoria-wood-interview-i-fear-being-my-mother/ |newspaper=The Telegraph |location= |access-date=20 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Nellie Wood (née Mape).&lt;ref&gt;[https://discoveryourancestors.co.uk/articles/a-comedy-heroine-descended-from-a-ww1-hero-6/]&lt;/ref&gt; She had three siblings: a brother, [[Chris Foote Wood|Chris]], and two sisters, Penny and Rosalind.&lt;ref name="Whetstone"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thejournal.co.uk/news/north-east-news/victoria-woods-supermum-4584918|title=Victoria Wood's supermum|last=Whetstone|first=David|date=11 February 2006|work=[[The Journal (newspaper)|The Journal]]|accessdate=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wood was born in [[Prestwich]] and brought up in [[Bury, Greater Manchester|Bury]] - both then in [[Lancashire]]. She was educated at Fairfield County Primary school&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Holland |first=Daniel |date=20 April 2016|title=Comedian Victoria Wood dies, aged 62, after cancer battle |url=http://www.theboltonnews.co.uk/news/14440140.Comedian_Victoria_Wood_dies__aged_62__after_cancer_battle/|newspaper=Bolton News|accessdate=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Bury Grammar School (Girls)|Bury Grammar School for Girls]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.manchester2002-uk.com/celebs/broadcasters4.html |title= Manchester Stars &amp; Celebrities of Television &amp; Film |work= Papillon Graphics' Virtual Encyclopedia &amp; Guide to Greater Manchester |publisher=manchester2002-uk.com |accessdate=22 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where she immediately found herself out of her depth. She recalled in an interview for ''[[Desert Island Discs]]'' in 2007:

{{quote| I was always top of the class, and when I went to [[grammar school]] I could not deal with everyone being as clever... I went under. I was a mess, a bit of a misfit. I didn't have any friends, let alone try to be funny...I didn't do any work, didn't have clean clothes and didn't wash. If I didn't have any money I'd steal from people, and if I hadn't done my homework I'd steal someone else's. I was envious of all the groups: the horsey group, the girls who went out with boys, the clever ones. Looking back, I feel really sorry for that little girl.&lt;ref name="Mail"&gt;{{cite news |last=Hoyle |first=Antonia |date=22 December 2007|title=Victoria Wood: The childhood misery that turned me into a funny girl|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-504241/Victoria-Wood-The-childhood-misery-turned-funny-girl.html|newspaper= Daily Mail|accessdate=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Wood developed [[eating disorder]]s, but in 1968, her father gave her a piano for her 15th birthday.&lt;ref name="Mail"/&gt; She later said of this unhappy time "The good thing about being isolated is you get a good look at what goes on. I was reading, writing and working at the piano all the time. I was doing a lot of other things that helped me to perform".&lt;ref name="Mail"/&gt; Later that year she joined the Rochdale Youth Theatre Workshop, where she felt she was "in the right place and knew what I was doing" and she made an impression with her comic skill and skill in writing.&lt;ref name="Mail"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/obituaries/2016/04/20/victoria-wood---obituary/|title=Victoria Wood –&amp;nbsp;obituary|publisher=|accessdate=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She went on to study drama at the [[University of Birmingham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/68405f22-a1f7-11e0-b485-00144feabdc0.html |title=The Inventory: Victoria Wood|date=2 July 2011|work=[[Financial Times]]|accessdate=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===1970s===
Wood began her show business career while an undergraduate, appearing on the TV talent show ''[[New Faces]]'' in 1974.&lt;ref name="Whetstone"/&gt; It led to an appearance in a sketch show featuring the series' winners ''[[The Summer Show]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/488970|title=BFI Film &amp; TV Database on The Summer Show|publisher=BFI|date=29 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further break came as a novelty act on the [[BBC]]'s consumer affairs programme ''[[That's Life!]]'' in 1976. She met long-term collaborator [[Julie Walters]] in the early 1970s when Wood applied for [[Manchester Polytechnic]],&lt;ref name = "WD ITV DFM"/&gt; and coincidentally met again when they appeared in the same theatre revue ''[[In at the Death]]'' in 1978 (for which Wood wrote a brief sketch). Its success led to the commissioning of Wood's first play ''[[Talent (1978 play)|Talent]]'' (in 1978), starring Hazel Clyne (in a role originally written for Walters), for which Wood won an award for the Most Promising New Writer. [[Peter Eckersley (TV producer)|Peter Eckersley]], the head of drama at [[ITV Granada|Granada Television]], saw ''Talent'' and invited Wood to create a television adaptation. This time Julie Walters took the lead role, while Wood reprised her stage role.&lt;ref name="Brandwood" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last =Duguid |first =Mark |title = Talent (1979) |work = Screenonline.org.uk |publisher =British Film Institute |date =July 2003 |url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/1241050/index.html |accessdate = 18 October 2007  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980–88===
The success of the television version of ''Talent'' led to Wood writing the follow-up, ''[[Nearly a Happy Ending]]''. Shortly afterwards she wrote a third play for Granada, ''[[Happy Since I Met You]]'', again with Walters alongside [[Duncan Preston]] as the male lead. In 1980, she wrote and starred in the stage play ''[[Good Fun]]''.&lt;ref name="Brandwood" /&gt;

Recognising her talent, Eckersley offered Wood a sketch show, although she was unsure of the project; she only agreed to go ahead if Walters received equal billing. Eckersley came up with an obvious title - ''[[Wood and Walters]]'',&lt;ref name = "WD ITV DFM"&gt;[[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] 50: ''What Did ITV Do For Me?'', interview with Victoria Wood (September 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; and the pilot episode was recorded. It led to a full series, featuring Duncan Preston and a supporting cast. In the period between the completion of the pilot and the shooting of the series, Eckersley died. Wood credited him with giving her her first big break, and felt that ''Wood and Walters'' suffered due to his death.&lt;ref name = "WD ITV DFM"/&gt; She was not impressed by Brian Armstrong, his fill-in, and was of the opinion that he hired unsuitable supporting actors.&lt;ref name="Brandwood"/&gt;

Wood appeared as a presenter in [[Yorkshire Television]]'s 1984 schools television programme for hearing-impaired children, ''Insight'', in a remake of the series originally presented by [[Derek Griffiths]]. In 1982 and 1983 she appeared as a panellist on BBC Radio 4's ''[[Just a Minute]]''.

In October 1983 Wood performed her first solo stand up show, ''Lucky Bag'' in a five-week run at the King's Head Theatre in Islington. The show transferred to the Ambassadors Theatre for a twelve night run in February 1984. ''Lucky Bag'' went on a short UK tour in November and December 1984 and was also released as a live album recorded at the Edinburgh Festival in 1983.&lt;ref name="Brandwood"/&gt;

Wood left Granada in 1984 for the BBC, who promised her more creative control over projects. Later that year, her sketch show ''[[Victoria Wood as Seen on TV]]'' went into production. Wood chose the actors: her friend Julie Walters once again starred, as did Duncan Preston. Wood's friend [[Celia Imrie]] and [[Susie Blake]] and [[Patricia Routledge]] were in the cast. ''As Seen on TV'' had the ''[[Acorn Antiques]]'' sketch, a parody of a low-budget soap opera, ''[[Crossroads (soap opera)|Crossroads]]'', and rumoured to be named after an antiques shop in her birthplace. ''Acorn Antiques'' is remembered for characters such as "Mrs Overall" (played by Walters), the deliberately bad camera angles and wobbling sets, and Celia Imrie's sarcastic tone as "Miss Babs". Wood's most popular comic song,&lt;ref name="Brandwood" /&gt; "The Ballad of Barry and Freda (Let's Do It)", originated in this show. It tells the story of Freda (a woman eager for sex) and Barry (an introverted man terrified of sex), and makes clever use of allusions to a multitude of risqué activities while avoiding all taboo words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Wood |first=Victoria
 |title=The Ballad of Barry and Freda (Let's do it!) |publisher=prestel.co.uk |url=http://www2.prestel.co.uk/cello/BarryAndFreda.htm |accessdate=27 August 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070909162400/http://www2.prestel.co.uk/cello/BarryAndFreda.htm |archivedate=9 September 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; A second series of ''[[Victoria Wood as Seen on TV]]'' was made in 1986, followed by a one-off 'special' in 1987.

In October 1987 Wood went on the road with her one-woman show. The tour included a sell out run at the London Palladium and had a second leg in April 1988. The end of 1988 saw the release of her second live performance ''Victoria Wood Live'' recorded at the Brighton Dome.&lt;ref name="Brandwood"/&gt;

In 1988 she appeared in the [[BAFTA]]-winning ''[[An Audience with...|An Audience with Victoria Wood]]'' for [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]. At the time of recording the show she was six months pregnant.

===1989–99===
During this period Wood moved away from the sketch show format and into more self-contained works, often with a bittersweet flavour. ''[[Victoria Wood (1989 TV series)|Victoria Wood]]'' (six parts, 1989) featured Wood in several individual stories such as "We'd Quite Like To Apologise", set in an airport departure lounge, and "Over to Pam", set around a fictional talk show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/1241016/index.html |title=Victoria Wood (1989)| work = Screenonline.org.uk |publisher= British Film Institute |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1990 Wood went on a 60-date tour of the United Kingdom which was followed by a ten-week run at the Strand Theatre in London titled ''Victoria Wood Up West''. Wood took the show on the road again during March 1991 where it was recorded at the [[Mayflower Theatre]] in Southampton, and later released as ''Victoria Wood Sold Out'' in 1991.&lt;ref name="Brandwood"/&gt;

She briefly returned to sketches for the 1992 Christmas Day special ''[[Victoria Wood's All Day Breakfast]]''.

In March 1993 Wood began a seven-month tour of the UK. The 104-date tour broke box office records, including 15 sell out shows at London's Royal Albert Hall, and played to residencies in Sheffield, Birmingham, Plymouth, Bristol, Nottingham, Manchester, Leicester, Liverpool, Bournemouth, Oxford, Southampton, Newcastle, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Leeds and Hull.&lt;ref&gt;Tour dates listed in 1993 and 1994 Tour Programmes.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brandwood"/&gt;

The television film ''[[Pat and Margaret]]'' (1994), starring Wood and Julie Walters as long-lost sisters with very different lifestyles, continued her return to stand-alone plays with a poignant undercurrent to the comedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last =Duguid |first =Mark |title =Pat and Margaret (1994) |work = Screenonline.org.uk |publisher = British Film Institute |date =July 2003 |url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/1246899/index.html |accessdate =18 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994 Wood starred in the one-off BBC 80-minute programme based on her 1993/94 stage show ''Victoria Wood: Live in Your Own Home''. The special featured stand-up routines, character monologues and songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-17625869.html|title=Television: Behave yourself Parky!|last=Young|first=Graham|date=24 March 2000|work=[[Birmingham Evening Mail]]|accessdate=20 April 2016}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; A shortened (48 minutes) version was released on DVD.

Wood set out on a 68-date tour of the UK in May 1996 which played at venues in Leicester, Sheffield, Ipswich, Blackpool, Bradford, Newcastle, Bournemouth, Brighton, Nottingham, Oxford, Southend, Manchester and Cambridge. The tour culminated with another 15 sell out shows at London's Royal Albert Hall in the autumn. The tour recommenced in April 1997 in Liverpool and then travelled to Australia and New Zealand during the Summer. It was later released as ''Victoria Wood Live 1997''.&lt;ref name="Brandwood"/&gt;

In October 1997 Wood released a compilation of 14 of her songs titled ''Victoria Wood, Real Life The Songs''.&lt;ref name="Brandwood"/&gt;

Her first sitcom ''[[Dinnerladies (TV series)|Dinnerladies]]'' (1998), continued her now established milieu of mostly female, mostly middle-aged characters depicted vividly and amusingly, but with a counterpoint of sadder themes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===2000–05===
December 2000 saw the Christmas sketch show special ''[[Victoria Wood with All the Trimmings]]'', featuring her regular troupe of actors as well as a string of special guest stars including [[Hugh Laurie]], [[Angela Rippon]], [[Bob Monkhouse]], [[Bill Paterson (actor)|Bill Paterson]], [[Delia Smith]] and [[Roger Moore]].

2001 saw Wood embark on her last ever stand up tour. The tour was titled ''Victoria Wood At It Again'' but was postponed slightly by Wood having to have an emergency hysterectomy shortly before the tour was due to begin. She re-wrote the entire first half of the show and incorporated the operation into her act. The 62-date tour included twelve nights at the Royal Albert Hall and had a further 23 dates in 2002.&lt;ref name="Brandwood"/&gt;

During this period Wood tended to move away from comedy to focus on drama. She continued to produce one-off specials including ''Victoria Wood's Sketch Show Story'' (2002) and ''Victoria Wood's Big Fat Documentary'' (2005).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title =Victoria Wood's Sketch Show Story |publisher =Simply Stephanie Beacham |year =2007 |url =http://simplystephaniebeacham.com/SketchShow/sketchshowstory.html |archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20060321165013/http://simplystephaniebeacham.com/SketchShow/sketchshowstory.html |dead-url =yes |archive-date =21 March 2006 |accessdate =18 October 2007 |df =dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title =Victoria Wood's Big Fat Documentary |publisher =weightlossresources.co.uk |year =2004 |url=http://www.weightlossresources.co.uk/diet/bigfatdocumentary.htm |accessdate =18 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wood wrote her first musical, ''[[Acorn Antiques: The Musical!]]'', which opened in 2005 at the [[Haymarket Theatre|Theatre Royal, Haymarket]], London, for a limited period, directed by [[Trevor Nunn]]. It starred several of the original cast, with [[Sally Ann Triplett]] playing Miss Berta (played in the series by Wood). Wood played Julie Walters' character Mrs Overall for matinee performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last =Caroline |first =Briggs |title =Mrs Overall Sings Onto The Stage | publisher =BBC News |date =2 December 2004 |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/4062051.stm |accessdate = 28 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2006–10===
Wood wrote the one-off [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] serious drama ''[[Housewife, 49]]'' (2006), an adaptation of the diaries of [[Nella Last]], and played the eponymous role of an introverted middle-aged character who discovers new confidence and friendships in Lancashire during the [[Second World War]]. ''Housewife, 49'' was critically acclaimed, and Wood won [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]]s for both her acting and writing for this drama&amp;nbsp;– a rare double.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title =Victoria Wood Scoops BAFTA Double |publisher =BBC News |date =20 May 2007 |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6670797.stm |accessdate = 18 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film also starred [[Stephanie Cole]] and David Threlfall as well as, in a small role, [[Sue Wallace]] with whom Wood had worked before and studied alongside at Birmingham.

In November 2006, Wood directed a revival production of ''Acorn Antiques: The Musical!'' with a new cast. The musical opened at [[the Lowry]] in [[City of Salford|Salford]] in December and toured the United Kingdom from January to July 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title =Acorn Antiques: The Musical! |publisher =The Stage |date =28 August 2007 |url =http://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/review.php/15334/acorn-antiques-the-musical- |accessdate =18 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2007, she appeared as herself in a series of advertisements featuring famous people working for the supermarket chain [[Asda]]. They featured Wood working in the bakery and introduced a catchphrase&amp;nbsp;– "there's no place like ASDA".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title =A Touch of Class? |work = Ad Breakdown |publisher =BBC News |date =2 May 2007 |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/6592007.stm |accessdate = 18 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wood was the subject of an episode of ''[[The South Bank Show]]'' in March 2007, and is the only woman to be the subject of two ''South Bank'' programmes (the previous occasion was in September 1996).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title =The South Bank Show |publisher =epguides.com |date =2 May 2007 |url = http://epguides.com/SouthBankShow/ |accessdate = 18 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wood appeared in a three-part travel documentary on [[BBC One]] called ''[[Victoria's Empire]]'', in which she travelled around the world in search of the history, cultural impact and customs the [[British Empire]] placed on the parts of the world it ruled. She departed Victoria Station, London, for [[Calcutta]], Hong Kong and [[Borneo]] in the first programme. In programme two she visited [[Ghana]], [[Jamaica]] and [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] and in the final programme, [[New Zealand]], Australia and [[Zambia]], finishing at the [[Victoria Falls]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news&lt;!--|title=A book, also called ''Victoria's Empire'', was released to accompany the series in the same year.--&gt; |last =Mangan |first =Lucy |title =The Weekend's TV: Victoria's Empire |publisher =The Guardian |date =30 April 2007 |url = https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/apr/30/tvandradio.comment |accessdate = 18 October 2007 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a tribute to Wood, the British television station [[UKTV Gold]] celebrated her work with a weekend marathon of programmes between 3 and 4 November 2007 featuring programmes such as ''Victoria Wood Live'' and ''[[Dinnerladies]]'' and ''Victoria Wood as Seen on TV''&amp;nbsp;– its first screening on British television since 1995.

Wood returned to stand-up comedy with a special performance for the celebratory show ''Happy Birthday BAFTA'' on 28 October 2007, alongside other household names. The programme was transmitted on [[ITV1]] on Wednesday 7 November 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=BAFTA Heritage |url=http://www.bafta.org/heritage/features/happy-birthday-bafta,165,BA.html |title=''Happy Birthday BAFTA'' |accessdate= 15 December 2013 |date=8 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Boxing Day 2007 she appeared as "Nana" in the Granada dramatisation of [[Noel Streatfeild]]'s novel ''[[Ballet Shoes (film)|Ballet Shoes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last =Hemley |first =Matthew |title =Wood to star in a BBC1 adaptation of Ballet Shoes |publisher =[[The Stage]] |date =20 July 2007 |url = http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/newsstory.php/17473/wood-to-star-in-a-bbc1-adaptation-of-ballet |accessdate = 18 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2007, when a guest on the radio programme ''[[Desert Island Discs]]'', Wood said she was about to make her first foray into film, writing a script described as a contemporary comedy about a middle-aged person. On Thursday, 12 June 2008, Wood was a member of the celebrity guest panel on the series ''[[The Apprentice: You're Fired!]]'' on BBC Two. In June 2009, she appeared as a panellist on the first two episodes of a series of ''[[I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue]]''.

Wood returned to television comedy for a one-off Christmas sketch-show special, her first in nine years, ''[[Victoria Wood's Mid Life Christmas]]'', transmitted on BBC One at 21:00 on Christmas Eve 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last =Brown |first =Mark |title =BBC One Christmas special for Victoria Wood |publisher =Seen It |date =17 September 2009 |url = http://www.seenit.co.uk/bbc-one-christmas-special-for-victoria-wood/094152/ |accessdate = 19 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It reunited Wood with Julie Walters in ''Lark Pies to Cranchesterford'', a spoof of BBC period dramas ''[[Lark Rise to Candleford]]'', ''[[Little Dorrit]]'' and ''[[Cranford (TV series)|Cranford]]''; a spoof documentary, ''Beyond the Marigolds'', following ''[[Acorn Antiques]]'' star Bo Beaumont (Walters); highlights from the ''Mid Life Olympics 2009'' with Wood as the commentator; parodies of personal injury advertisements; and a reprise of Wood's most famous song "The Ballad of Barry and Freda" ("Let's Do It"), performed as a musical number with tap-dancers and a band. ''Victoria Wood: Seen On TV'', a 90-minute documentary looking back on her career, was broadcast on BBC Two on 21 December, whilst a behind-the-scenes special programme about ''Midlife Christmas'', ''Victoria Wood: What Larks!'', was broadcast on BBC One on 30 December.

===2011–15===
On New Year's Day 2011 Wood appeared in a BBC drama ''[[Eric and Ernie]]'' as [[Eric Morecambe]]'s mother, Sadie Bartholomew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title =Victoria Wood tells all about Eric and Ernie | publisher =BBC News |date =30 December 2010 |url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-11768311 |accessdate = 22 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the 2011 [[Manchester International Festival]], Wood wrote and directed ''[[That Day We Sang]]'', a musical set in 1969 with [[flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]] to 1929. It tells the story of a middle-aged couple who find love after meeting on a TV programme about a choir they both sang in 40 years previously. Although the characters are imaginary, the choir sang with the [[Hallé Orchestra]] in Manchester's [[Free Trade Hall]] on a record that sold more than a million copies. Apart from the pieces on the 1929 recording ([[Henry Purcell|Purcell's]] "[[Nymphs and Shepherds]]" and the Evening Benediction from ''[[Hänsel und Gretel (opera)|Hansel and Gretel]]'') the score for the musical was written by Wood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/s/1405472_remembering_manchester_childrens_choir |first= Lydia |last= Warren |title=Remembering Manchester Children's Choir
