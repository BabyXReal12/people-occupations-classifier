'''Brian Joseph Regan''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|iː|ɡ|ən}}) (born June 2, 1958) is an American [[stand-up comedian]] who uses [[observational comedy|observational]], [[sarcasm|sarcastic]], and [[self-deprecation|self-deprecating]] humor. His performances are clean as he refrains from [[profanity]] and [[off-color humor]]. Regan's material typically covers everyday events, such as shipping a package with [[United Parcel Service|UPS]], mortgages, and visits to the [[optometrist]]. While he does not define himself as youth-oriented, Regan makes frequent references to childhood, including little league baseball, grade school spelling bees, and science projects. Body language and facial expressions make his stand-up act atypically physical.  His clean, off-center humor has been praised by critics and contemporaries alike and Regan enjoys a fan base that crosses age groups.{{citation needed (lead)|date=February 2015}}

==Early life==
Regan was born in [[Miami, Florida]], and was raised in [[Westchester, Florida]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2010-01-21/entertainment/sfl-comedy-festival-south-beach-012110_1_fillmore-miami-beach-brian-regan-south-beach-comedy-festival|title=Miami native Brian Regan joins lineup at South Beach Comedy Festival|work=tribunedigital-sunsentinel}}&lt;/ref&gt; with seven brothers and sisters. He attended Christopher Columbus High School. He is of [[Irish people|Irish]] descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elkharttruth.com/living/2014/10/11/Q-A-Comedian-Brian-Regan-talks-humor-and-his-upcoming-show-in-South-Bend.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20141213110625/http://www.elkharttruth.com/living/2014/10/11/Q-A-Comedian-Brian-Regan-talks-humor-and-his-upcoming-show-in-South-Bend.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2014-12-13|title=Q&amp;A: Comedian Brian Regan talks humor and his upcoming show in South Bend|work=Elkhart Truth}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regan was always a fan of [[Steve Martin]], The [[Smothers Brothers]] and [[Johnny Carson]]. Though he attended [[Heidelberg College]] in Ohio with plans of being an accountant, a football coach there encouraged him to consider theater and communications. He played wide receiver on the football team at Heidelberg.  During his last semester in 1980, Regan dropped out of school to pursue stand-up comedy (he eventually finished his degree in 1997). Brian's brother, [[Dennis Regan]], also makes his living as a stand-up comedian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comedians.about.com/od/currentcomedians/p/brianregan.htm|title=Brian Regan (Stand-up Comedian) Biography|author=Patrick Bromley|work=About.com Entertainment}}&lt;/ref&gt;
