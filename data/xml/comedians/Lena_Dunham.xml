==Career==
===2000s: Oberlin College and early works===
While a student at Oberlin College, Dunham produced several independent short films and uploaded them to [[YouTube]]. Many of her early films dealt with themes of sexual enlightenment and were produced in a [[mumblecore]] filmmaking style, a dialog-heavy style in which young people talk about their personal relationships.

In 2009, Dunham created the ''[[Index Magazine]]'' web series, ''[[Delusional Downtown Divas]]'', which satirized the New York City art scene. The production was unpaid, so Dunham and her friends "pooled their money from babysitting and art-assistant gigs and borrowed some camera gear."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Yuan |first=Jada |url=http://nymag.com/arts/art/features/58305/ |title=Almost Famous |work=New York |date=August 16, 2009 |accessdate=March 28, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402131636/http://nymag.com/arts/art/features/58305/ |archivedate=April 2, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Tiny Furniture}}
[[File:Lena Dunham (cropped).jpg|thumb|Dunham in 2010|278x278px|left]]Dunham had a career breakthrough with her semiautobiographic 2010 feature film ''[[Tiny Furniture]]''; the film won Best Narrative Feature at [[South by Southwest|South by Southwest Music and Media Conference]], and subsequently screened at such festivals as [[Maryland Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.marieclaire.com/career-money/advice/tips/lena-dunham |title=Lena Dunham Profile – Filmmaker |last=Maura |first=Sophie |date= |website=Marieclaire.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100917110644/http://www.marieclaire.com/career-money/advice/tips/lena-dunham |archive-date=September 17, 2010 |dead-url=yes |access-date=February 8, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dunham plays the lead role of Aura.&lt;ref name="NewYorker-TinyFurniture-2010" /&gt; [[Laurie Simmons]] (Lena Dunham's real-life mother) plays Aura's mother, and Lena's real-life sister Grace plays Aura's on-screen sister.

The success of ''Tiny Furniture'' earned Dunham a blind script deal at [[HBO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/girls-star-lena-dunham-her-410179/|title=The Rise of Lena Dunham: From the NYC Art Scene to Hollywood Lightning Rod|date=January 9, 2013|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate=March 28, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150412123148/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/girls-star-lena-dunham-her-410179/|archivedate=April 12, 2015|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The network set Dunham up with veteran show runner [[Jennifer Konner]]. Konner told [[New York (magazine)|Vulture]]'s Jada Yuan that she got involved with Dunham because she was an obsessive ''Tiny Furniture'' fan:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I got a copy of ''Tiny Furniture'' from [HBO president] [[Sue Naegle]]. Actually, [''[[New Girl]]'' creator] [[Liz Meriwether]] told me about it and said, 'Oh, there's this great movie. This girl, she's 23, she wrote, directed, and starred in it; she's in her underwear the whole time.' And I was like, 'I really don't want to see that.' And then she was like, 'Oh, trust me, it's great.' So Sue gave it to me just because she had it...I used to, like, give out copies of the movie. But I'd just broken up with my writing partner and couldn't be less interested in the idea of supervising anybody. I really was like, "I'm going to find my voice, and be on my own." And then they called me and they were like, 'Oh, the ''Tiny Furniture'' girl is doing a show, do you want to supervise her?' And I was like, 'Yes! One million percent. Sign me up. Totally on board.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vulture.com/2012/05/girls-jenni-konner-interview.html|title=Girls Producer Jenni Konner on the Critics, Judd Apatow, and Loving Lena Dunham|date=May 14, 2012|work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|accessdate=March 28, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402163410/http://www.vulture.com/2012/05/girls-jenni-konner-interview.html|archivedate=April 2, 2015|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

"I emailed her and told her I thought it was great," Apatow told ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''. "It turned out she was in the middle of negotiating a deal to develop a show for HBO and that her partner was Jenni Konner, whom I had worked with on ''[[Undeclared]]'' and a bunch of other projects.

The first season premiered on HBO on April 15, 2012, and received critical acclaim. ''[[The New York Times]]'' applauded the series, writing that "''Girls'' may be the [[millennial generation]]'s rebuttal to ''[[Sex and the City]]'', but the first season was at times as cruelly insightful and bleakly funny as ''[[Louie (U.S. TV series)|Louie]]'' on FX or ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'' on HBO."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/11/arts/television/lena-dunhams-girls-returns-to-hbo.html "The Edges Are Still Sharp in Brooklyn"].

==== Controversy ====

Upon release, ''Girls'' was met with criticism regarding the all-[[White people|white]] main cast in the otherwise culturally diverse setting of New York City (the only black actors in the pilot were a homeless man and a taxi driver, and the only Asian actress had the sole trait of being good at [[Photoshop]]).&lt;ref name="Fox"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2012/04/18/criticism-hbo-girls-for-being-about-white-girls-money-whining-justified |title=Criticism of HBO's 'Girls' for being about 'white girls, money, whining' justified? |last=McKay |first=Hollie |date=April 18, 2012 |publisher=[[FoxNews.com]] |accessdate=April 18, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419142927/http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2012/04/18/criticism-hbo-girls-for-being-about-white-girls-money-whining-justified/ |archivedate=April 19, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HP"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/16/girls-reviews-backlash-hbo-show_n_1429328.html |title='Girls' Reviews: New HBO Show And Lena Dunham Face Backlash On Racism And More |last=Makarechi |first=Kia |date=April 16, 2012 |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |accessdate=April 18, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419010428/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/16/girls-reviews-backlash-hbo-show_n_1429328.html |archivedate=April 19, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Agreeing that there is a lack of racial diversity on ''Girls'', a comment from ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' argued that the issue is the industry as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/maureen-ryan/girls-hbo-racist_b_1451931.html |title='HBO's 'Girls' Isn't Racist, Television Is Racist (And Sexist) |last=Ryan III |first=Maureen |date=April 25, 2012 |publisher=Huffington Post |accessdate=March 23, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150605123417/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/maureen-ryan/girls-hbo-racist_b_1451931.html |archivedate=June 5, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lesley Arfin, a writer for the show, responded sarcastically to the controversy with the tweeted comment about a movie that highlights an African-American girl's rise from incestuous sexual abuse while living in Harlem: "What really bothered me most about ''[[Precious (film)|Precious]]'' was that there was no representation of ME."

Dunham spoke publicly about the issues on several occasions. In an interview with [[IndieWire]], she said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I am a half-Jew, half-[[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|WASP]], and I wrote two Jews and two WASPs. Something I wanted to avoid was tokenism in casting. If I had one of the four girls, if, for example, she was African-American, I feel like — not that the experience of an African-American girl and a white girl are drastically different, but there has to be specificity to that experience [that] I wasn't able to speak to. I really wrote the show from a gut-level place, and each character was a piece of me or based on someone close to me. And only later did I realize that it was four white girls. As much as I can say it was an accident, it was only later as the criticism came out, I thought, 'I hear this and I want to respond to it.' And this is a hard issue to speak to because all I want to do is sound sensitive and not say anything that will horrify anyone or make them feel more isolated, but I did write something that was super-specific to my experience, and I always want to avoid rendering an experience I can't speak to accurately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/shadowandact/2c060de0-993b-11e1-bcc4-123138165f92 |title=Lena Dunham Addresses "Girls" Diversity Criticism &amp; Why I Just Don't Care... &amp;#124; Shadow and Act |date= |publisher=Blogs.indiewire.com |accessdate=January 23, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131013205833/http://blogs.indiewire.com/shadowandact/2c060de0-993b-11e1-bcc4-123138165f92 |archivedate=October 13, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In September 2016, Dunham criticized [[NFL]] player [[Odell Beckham Jr.]] for his interactions with her at the [[Met Gala]]. Dunham said, "I was sitting next to Odell Beckham Jr., and it was so amazing because it was like he looked at me and he determined I was not the shape of a woman by his standards. He was like, 'That's a marshmallow. That's a child. That's a dog.' It wasn't mean — he just seemed confused. The vibe was very much like, 'Do I want to f--- it? Is it wearing a … yep, it's wearing a tuxedo. I'm going to go back to my cell phone." She added, "It was like we were forced to be together, and he literally was scrolling Instagram rather than have to look at a woman in a bow tie. I was like, 'This should be called the Metropolitan Museum of Getting Rejected by Athletes'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Williams |first1=Alex |title=Odell Beckham Jr. Responds to the Lena Dunham Dust-Up: ‘I Have to Learn More About the Situation’ |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/08/fashion/odell-beckham-jr-lena-dunham-met-gala-response.html |website=New York Times |publisher=New York Times |accessdate=June 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dunham later apologized for her characterization of his interactions and thoughts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kelly |first1=Seth |title=Lena Dunham Pens Apology to Odell Beckham Jr. After Met Gala Comments Backlash |url=https://variety.com/2016/digital/news/lena-dunham-apology-odell-beckham-jr-amy-schumer-lenny-letter-1201851866/ |website=Variety |accessdate=June 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2016, Dunham declared on a podcast that she wished she'd had an [[abortion]], explaining that she wanted to better understand women who have. The comment was widely condemned as insensitive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://motto.time.com/4608364/lena-dunham-wish-abortion-comments/?xid=time_socialflow_facebook "Lena Dunham Said She Wishes She Had an Abortion"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161222151840/http://motto.time.com/4608364/lena-dunham-wish-abortion-comments/?xid=time_socialflow_facebook |date=December 22, 2016 }}, ''Us Weekly'', December 20, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/biz/news/lena-dunham-abortion-controversy-1201946387/ |title=Lena Dunham Faces Backlash for Saying She Wishes She'd Had an Abortion |website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |first=Arya |last=Roshanian |date=December 20, 2016 |accessdate=December 23, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161223171503/http://variety.com/2016/biz/news/lena-dunham-abortion-controversy-1201946387/ |archivedate=December 23, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dunham later issued a lengthy apology on her [[Instagram]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gibson |first1=Caitlin |title=Lena Dunham gave a very Lena Dunham apology for her controversial comment on abortion |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2016/12/21/lena-dunham-gave-a-very-lena-dunham-apology-for-her-controversial-comment-on-abortion/ |website=[[Washington Post]] |date=December 21, 2016 |accessdate=December 22, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161223140501/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2016/12/21/lena-dunham-gave-a-very-lena-dunham-apology-for-her-controversial-comment-on-abortion/ |archivedate=December 23, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/lena-dunham-apologizes-distasteful-joke-abortion-958213 |title=Lena Dunham Apologizes for "Distasteful Joke" About Abortion |website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |first=Meena |last=Jang |date=December 20, 2016 |accessdate=December 23, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161222213910/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/lena-dunham-apologizes-distasteful-joke-abortion-958213 |archivedate=December 22, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2017, Dunham briefly defended ''Girls'' writer [[Murray Miller]], whom actress [[Aurora Perrineau]] had accused of sexually assaulting her in 2012 when she was seventeen. Dunham responded to the accusations by saying "While our first instinct is to listen to every woman's story, our insider knowledge of Murray's situation makes us confident that sadly this accusation is one of the 3% of assault cases that are misreported every year."&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-42042852 |title=Lena Dunham sorry for comment on writer accused of sexual assault |date=November 19, 2017 |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; After an immediate backlash, Dunham apologized for that statement, saying that it was "absolutely the wrong time to come forward with such a statement" and that "every woman who comes forward deserves to be heard, fully and completely, and our relationship to the accused should not be part of the calculation anyone makes when examining her case."&lt;ref name=BBC /&gt; Dunham was described as a "[[hipster racist]]" for her defense of Miller, as Perrineau is of mixed race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=D'Zurilla | first=Christie | date=20 November 2017 | title=Lena Dunham accused of 'hipster racism' after she initially defended 'Girls' writer | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-lena-dunham-accused-of-hipster-racism-1511203068-htmlstory.html | access-date=25 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Mahdawi | first=Arwa | date=25 November 2017 | title=Is Lena Dunham's 'hipster racism' just old-fashioned prejudice? | work=[[The Guardian]] | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/25/hipster-racism-lena-dunham-prejudice | access-date=25 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In 2012, Dunham began dating [[Jack Antonoff]], the lead guitarist of the band [[Fun (band)|Fun]] and the founder of [[Bleachers (band)|Bleachers]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/girls-lena-dunham-is-dating-funs-jack-antonoff-201259 "Girls' Lena Dunham Is Dating Fun.'s Jack Antonoff"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140219165829/http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/girls-lena-dunham-is-dating-funs-jack-antonoff-201259 |date=February 19, 2014 }}, ''Us Weekly'', September 5, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eonline.com/news/904908/lena-dunham-and-jack-antonoff-break-up-after-five-years&lt;/ref&gt; Dunham and Antonoff remained together until December 2017; they subsequently announced that the separation was "amicable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/904908/lena-dunham-and-jack-antonoff-break-up-after-five-years|title=Lena Dunham and Jack Antonoff Break Up After Five Years|date=January 8, 2018|first=McKenna|last=Aiello|publisher=[[E!]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jensen|first1=Erin|title=Lena Dunham, Jack Antonoff break up after spending more than five years together|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2018/01/09/lena-dunham-jack-antonoff-break-up-after-being-together-more-than-spenmoreding-than-five-yea/1015954001/|accessdate=January 9, 2018|work=[[USA Today]]|date=January 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dunham was diagnosed with [[obsessive compulsive disorder]] as a child, and continues to take a low dose of an [[antidepressant]] to relieve her [[Anxiety disorder|anxiety]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Suval |first=Lauren |url=http://psychcentral.com/blog/archives/2013/04/28/obsessive-compulsive-disorder-in-the-media |title=Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder in the Media |publisher=Psychcentral.com |accessdate=May 13, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511222605/http://psychcentral.com/blog/archives/2013/04/28/obsessive-compulsive-disorder-in-the-media/ |archivedate=May 11, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/14/magazine/lena-dunham.html |title=Lena Dunham Is Not Done Confessing |work=The New York Times |date=September 10, 2014 |first=Meghan |last=Daum |accessdate=September 10, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140911013405/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/14/magazine/lena-dunham.html |archivedate=September 11, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2018, Dunham wrote an essay for ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' about her decision to have a [[hysterectomy]] due to [[endometriosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vogue.com/article/lena-dunham-hysterectomy-vogue-march-2018-issue|title=In Her Own Words: Lena Dunham on Her Decision to Have a Hysterectomy at 31|publisher=Vogue|first=Lena|last=Dunham|date=February 14, 2018|accessdate=April 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political activities==
In fall of 2012, Dunham appeared in a video advertisement promoting President Barack Obama's re-election, delivering a monologue, which, according to a blog quoted in ''[[The Atlantic]]'', tried to "get the youth vote by comparing voting for the first time to having sex for the first time".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Franke-Ruta |first1=Garance |title=Lena Dunham's New Obama Ad—As Controversial As Everything She Does? |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/10/lena-dunhams-new-obama-ad-as-controversial-as-everything-she-does/264139 |work=The Atlantic |accessdate=February 15, 2015 |date=October 25, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150209035250/http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/10/lena-dunhams-new-obama-ad-as-controversial-as-everything-she-does/264139/ |archivedate=February 9, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fox News]] reported criticism from [[Media Research Center]]'s Lauren Thompson, public relations professional [[Ronn Torossian]], and media trainer Louise Pennell, which labeled the advertisement as tasteless, inappropriate, and a ploy to lure the younger female vote. It included a comment from Steve Hall of Ad Rants saying that "not everyone was so offended." A friend of Dunham said the actress was not paid for her performance on the spot, and Dunham defended the ad by tweeting "The video may be light but the message is serious: vote for women's rights."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Critics blast Obama campaign for new ad that likens voting for Barack Obama to a young woman losing her virginity |date=October 25, 2012 |publisher=Fox News Channel |url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2012/10/26/girls-creator-lena-dunham-compares-voting-to-barack-obama-to-losing-virginity |accessdate=October 28, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121027200054/http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2012/10/26/girls-creator-lena-dunham-compares-voting-to-barack-obama-to-losing-virginity/ |archivedate=October 27, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Nation,'' Ari Melber wrote "the ad's style is vintage Lena: edgy and informed, controversial but achingly self-aware, sexually proud and affirmatively feminist."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenation.com/blog/170843/obama-campaign-launches-sexy-lena-dunham-ad-your-first-time], ''The Nation''.
