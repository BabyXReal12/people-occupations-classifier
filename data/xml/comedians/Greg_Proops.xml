==Career==

===Improv comedy===
{{Refimprove|date=December 2017}}
After college, he joined an improv group with [[Mike McShane]]. Both Proops and McShane impressed producers [[Dan Patterson]] and [[Mark Leveson]], who put them on their show, ''[[Whose Line Is It Anyway? (UK TV series)|Whose Line Is It Anyway?]]''. He frequently instigated jokes concerning various [[idiosyncrasy|idiosyncrasies]] and differences between [[British English]] and [[American English]], and would frequently banter with [[Clive Anderson]] on these matters (among others). He lived in London for four years when he was doing the show and lists McShane, [[Richard Vranch]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-smartest-man-in-the-world/id401055309/ |title=iTunes - podcasts - The Smartest Man in the World - "Legends" |publisher=itunes.apple.com |date=2012-03-23 |accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Colin Mochrie]] among his best friends. After the show ended, he was recalled for the [[Whose Line Is It Anyway? (U.S. TV series)|American version]] and was a regular "fourth contestant".

Proops also appeared in every episode of the short-lived ''[[Drew Carey's Green Screen Show]]'', where the performers would play improv games (some of which were taken from the show's main influence ''Whose Line Is It Anyway?'') in front of a massive green screen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whose-line.com/greenscreen/ |title=Drew Carey's Green Screen Show |publisher=Whose-line.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, animators would draw on the background and other props. In April 2011, ''[[Drew Carey's Improv-A-Ganza]]'' premiered on [[Game Show Network|GSN]] featuring Proops along with other frequent guests from ''[[Whose Line Is It Anyway? (UK TV series)|Whose Line is it Anyway?]]'' In July 2012, Proops appeared in ABC's improvisation show, ''[[Trust Us with Your Life]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2012/tv/reviews/trust-us-with-your-life-1117947868/|title=Trust Us With Your Life|last=Lowry|first=Brian|date=2012-07-09|work=Variety|access-date=2017-12-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
