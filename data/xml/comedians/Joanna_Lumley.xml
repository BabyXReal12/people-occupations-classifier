Lumley appeared in an early episode of the ''[[Bruce Forsyth]] Show'' in 1966.

Hers was the voice behind the iconic [[Simple Skincare|Simple skincare]] commercial in which robotic arms sprayed and perfumed a pristine white lily. The commercial entitled 'Gilding the Lily' was created by art director Colin Underhay and copywriter Alex Pearl.

And from 2005 to 2006 she appeared in adverts for [[insurance]] brokers [[Privilege (insurance company)|Privilege]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pearlman|first=Julia|url=http://www.brandrepublic.com/news/521801/Female-consumers-turned-off-tabloid-fodder-endorsing-brands/?DCMP=ILC-SEARCH|title=Female consumers turned off by 'tabloid fodder' endorsing brands|work=Brand Republic News|date=13 October 2005|accessdate=21 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brandrepublic.com/bulletin/dmdailybulletin/article/543679/privilege-insurance-seeks-direct-shop-back-tv-drive|title=Privilege Insurance seeks direct shop to back TV drive|work=Brand Republic News|date=1 March 2006|accessdate=21 October 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130610003817/http://www.brandrepublic.com/bulletin/dmdailybulletin/article/543679/privilege-insurance-seeks-direct-shop-back-tv-drive/|archivedate=10 June 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lumley has also appeared on the last run of [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s ''[[Parkinson (TV series)|Parkinson]]'' as a guest, on 27 October 2007, discussing the subject of young girls across the UK and how they need to behave better if they hope to be successful. She was asked to write the introduction to a re-edition in November 2007 of the book called ''The Magic Key To Charm'' written by the pioneering female journalist [[Eileen Ascroft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/showbiz/news/a78627/joanna-lumley-wants-girls-to-behave-better.html|title= Joanna Lumley wants girls to behave better|date=27 October 2007|first=Daniel|last=Kilkelly|work=Digital Spy}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a book of tips to women, first written by Ascroft in 1938 about how to be glamorous. "I thought it was absolutely enchanting, it's how young women were told how to behave in the old days and I think it might be just coming back for a bit of a revival", she explained in the interview.&lt;blockquote&gt;"Because, I have to say I adore our young ones and I think we have got some of the prettiest and loveliest girls in the world but I think sometimes the behaviour gets a bit bad and I think the girls let themselves down. They are so pretty and so lovely but they should behave better, I think, then they will be more successful."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1999 she appeared in the [[Comic Relief]] ''Doctor Who'' parody ''[[The Curse of Fatal Death]]'' as the final incarnation of the Doctor.&lt;ref&gt;

In 2009 she portrayed a rock star, believed to be dead for 35 years, but more predominantly, her twin, in the "Counter Culture Blues" episode of the British television mystery series ''[[Lewis (TV series)|Lewis]]'' (known in the U.S. as ''Inspector Lewis'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Leigh | last = Holmwood | title = TV ratings: Joanna Lumley in Lewis watched by 6 million | date = 14 April 2009 | publisher = Guardian News and Media Limited | url = https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/apr/14/lewis-joanna-lumley | work = The Guardian |location=London | accessdate =17 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Lumley appeared in ''Uptown Downstairs Abbey'', the [[Comic Relief#2011 event|Comic Relief]] parody of the critically acclaimed historical television dramas ''[[Downton Abbey]]'' and ''[[Upstairs, Downstairs (1971 TV series)|Upstairs Downstairs]]''. Playing herself and the character of Mrs. Danvers, she starred alongside others including Jennifer Saunders, [[Kim Cattrall]], [[Victoria Wood]], [[Harry Enfield]], [[Patrick Barlow]], [[Dale Winton]], [[Olivia Colman]] and [[Tim Vine]].

In recent years, Lumley has worked extensively with ITV, and in 2010 Lumley was executive producer and presenter of ''Joanna Lumley's Nile'', where she journeyed up the [[River Nile]] from sea to source in [[Rwanda]], for ITV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.tigeraspect.co.uk/?p=3916#more-3916 | title = Joanna Lumley's Nile | accessdate = 17 January 2012 | date = 12 April 2010 | work = Tiger Aspect Productions | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110803080437/http://www.tigeraspect.co.uk/?p=3916#more-3916 | archive-date = 3 August 2011 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was broadcast in four parts on ITV beginning on 12 April 2010, and repeated in June 2013.

==Activism==
Lumley is best known for her support for [[Gurkha]]s, the [[Tibetan independence movement|exiled Tibetan people and government]], the [[Kondha]] indigenous people of India and the Prospect Burma charity, which offers grants to Burmese students, for whom she broadcast a BBC Radio 4 charity appeal in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prospectburma.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=39&amp;Itemid=2|title=Home - Prospect Burma|work=prospectburma.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father was a commanding officer of a troop of Gurkhas who fought in [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="The Daily Telegraph"/&gt;

===Gurkha Justice Campaign===
[[File:Guka Joanna Lumley 1.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Lumley with [[David Cameron]], [[Bob Russell (UK politician)|Bob Russell]] and the Liberal Democrat leader, [[Nick Clegg]], celebrating the Gurkha vote against the government]]
{{Main article|Gurkha Justice Campaign}}
In 2008, Lumley became the public face of a campaign to provide all [[Nepalese people|Nepalese origin]] [[Gurkha]] veterans who served in the [[British Army]] before 1997 the right to settle in Britain. Those serving after 1997 had already been granted permission, but the UK Government has not extended the offer to all of the Gurkhas, who are natives of Nepal. On 20 November 2008, Lumley led a large all-party group including Gurkhas starting from [[Parliament Square]] to [[10 Downing Street]] with a petition signed by 250,000 people. She supports the [[Gurkha Justice Campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gurkhajustice.org.uk/about_us.html "About the Gurkha Justice Campaign: Campaign Organisers"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131001173054/http://gurkhajustice.org.uk/about_us.html |date=1 October 2013 }} Gurkha Justice web site&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 April 2009, she stated that she was "ashamed" of the UK administration's decision to affix five criteria to the Gurkhas' right to settle in the UK. With the support of both Opposition parties and Labour rebel MPs on 29 April 2009, a Liberal Democrat motion that all Gurkhas be offered an equal right of residence was passed, allowing Gurkhas who served before 1997 residence in the UK and access to housing, social security and healthcare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8014265.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Fury over Gurkha settlement plan | date=24 April 2009 | accessdate=27 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8019745.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Lib Dems challenge Gurkha ruling | date=26 April 2009 | accessdate=27 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8023882.stm|title=BBC 'Brown defeated over Gurkha rules'|accessdate=29 April 2009 | date=29 April 2009 | publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the Government defeat, the [[Minister of State for Borders and Immigration|Minister for Immigration]] [[Phil Woolas]] announced that a further review would be completed by the middle of July.

On 5 May 2009, Lumley said that she had received private assurances of support from "a senior member of the [[British Royal Family|Royal Family]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8034131.stm|title= No 10 denies Lumley 'Gurkha snub'|publisher= BBC News|date= 5 May 2009|accessdate=23 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and attended a meeting with [[British Prime Minister]] [[Gordon Brown]] at [[10 Downing Street]] the following day. Afterwards, she described the meeting as "extremely positive", and praised Mr Brown, saying, "I trust him. I rely on him. And I know that he has now taken this matter into his own hands and so today is a very good day."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8036036.stm|title= Lumley 'trusts' Brown on Gurkhas|publisher= BBC News|date= 6 May 2009|accessdate=23 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, on the day following the meeting with Brown, five Gurkha veterans who had applied for residency in the United Kingdom received letters telling them that their appeals had been rejected – many saw this as a betrayal, despite the fact that for the letters to have been received the day after the meeting they might have been sent before it (and certainly after the 29 April Commons vote). Lumley confronted [[Phil Woolas]] at the BBC Westminster studios about the issue and, after pursuing him around the studio, the pair held an impromptu press conference in which Woolas agreed to accept Gurkha Justice Campaign input in developing new guidelines by July while giving sympathetic treatment to Gurkhas not meeting the then current immigration guidelines before the development of new guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8037181.stm|title= Lumley in public clash on Gurkhas|publisher= BBC News|date= 7 May 2009|accessdate=23 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a [[Home Affairs Select Committee|Commons Home Affairs Committee]] meeting in which talks were held between campaigners, the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] and the [[Home Office]] on 19 May, [[Gordon Brown]] announced to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] on 20 May that the [[Home Secretary]] [[Jacqui Smith]] would make a statement on the issue the following day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/defence/5360033/Gurkhas-in-Britain-a-timeline-of-their-campaign-to-stay.html|title= Gurkhas in Britain: a timeline of their campaign to stay|work= The Daily Telegraph|date= 21 May 2009|accessdate=23 May 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ms Smith subsequently announced that all Gurkha veterans who had served four years or more in the British Army before 1997 would be allowed to settle in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8060607.stm|title= Gurkhas win right to settle in UK|publisher= BBC News|date= 21 May 2009|accessdate=23 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of her campaigning skills, there were calls for Joanna Lumley to stand as a [[Member of Parliament (UK)|Member of Parliament]] at the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|forthcoming general election]]. However, she has dismissed the suggestion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/opinion/columnists/lindy-mcdowell/lindy-mcdowell-how-joanna--lumley--is-leading-the-charge-14312324.html|work= The Belfast Telegraph|first= Lindy|last= McDowell|title= How Joanna Lumley is leading the charge|date= 23 May 2009|accessdate=23 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; During an appearance on ''[[Friday Night with Jonathan Ross]]'' on 29 May, she reiterated that she had no desire to run for election to the House of Commons.

In July 2009, Lumley went on a visit to Nepal. Upon her arrival at [[Tribhuvan International Airport]], she was greeted by crowds of Gurkha supporters. Lumley said in a statement, "I feel so humbled by the fact I'm going to meet so many ex-Gurkhas and their families, and see where they are and how they live."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8169319.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Lumley mobbed by crowds in Nepal | date=26 July 2009 | accessdate=27 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there, Lumley was hailed 'Daughter of Nepal' by the crowds of fans at the airport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8169641.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Lumley greeted as 'daughter of Nepal' | date=26 July 2009 | accessdate=27 March 2010 | first=Joanna | last=Jolly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Work for Survival International===
{{Main article|Survival International}}
Lumley has long been a supporter of [[Survival International]] and the cause of indigenous rights, and narrated Survival's documentary, ''Mine: story of a sacred mountain''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1433152/|title=Mine: Story of a Sacred Mountain|date=1 April 2009|publisher=|via=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.survivalinternational.org/news/4604|title=London protesters vow to stop British mine and destruction of tribe in India|first=Survival|last=International|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film tells the story of the remote [[Kondha|Dongria Kondha]] tribe in India and their battle to stop a vast [[bauxite]] mine from destroying their land and way of life. In defence of the Dongria, she has said, &lt;blockquote&gt;"It greatly disturbs me that a British company will be responsible for the destruction of these wonderful people. I urge the public to support the Dongria, who simply want to be allowed to live in peace. Unlike so many of India's rural poor, the Dongria actually live very well in the Niyamgiri hills, and it's a terrible irony that what [[Vedanta Resources|Vedanta]] is proposing to do in the name of 'development' will actually destroy this completely self-sufficient people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.survivalinternational.org/news/4403|title=Joanna Lumley narrates new film about remote tribe|first=Survival|last=International|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Lumley also contributed her writing for the book ''We Are One: A Celebration of Tribal Peoples'', released in October 2009 with profits going in support of Survival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.survivalinternational.org/weareone|title=We Are One|first=Survival|last=International|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A collection of photographs, statements from tribal people and essays from international authors, the book explores the richness of the cultures of [[indigenous peoples]] around the world and the risks to their existence. In her essay for the book, Lumley speaks of the Dongria way of life and the threats they face in the name of corporate interests, and calls for action to stop such decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=We are One: A Celebration of Tribal Peoples |last=Eede |first=Joanna |publisher=Quadrille Publishing |year=2009 |isbn=1-84400-729-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lumley supports charities including [[Suffolk]] Family Carers, [[Child Rescue Nepal]] and [[Kids for Kids]]. She has been a [[vegetarian]] for 40 years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2009/aug/31/joanna-lumley-interview | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Joanna Lumley: 'I don't make a very good goddess' | first=Laura | last=Barton | date=31 August 2009 | accessdate=27 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;. She has donated books to [[Book Aid International]]. She is patron of the [[Born Free Foundation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bornfree.org.uk/who-we-work-with/celebrity-supporters/joanna-lumley-obe/|title=Joanna Lumley|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and passionate about the [[Free Tibet Campaign|Free Tibet]] campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freetibet.org/news-media/pr/joanna-lumley-join-huge-london-demonstrations-support-tibet|title=Joanna Lumley to join huge London demonstrations in support of Tibet - Free Tibet|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other charities supported include [[Mind (charity)|Mind]], [[ActionAid]], [[SANE (charity)|SANE]], Kidasha (formerly CWS) which works on behalf of children in Nepal, and the [[Spike Milligan]] statue memorial fund, based in [[Finchley]], north London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.looktothestars.org/celebrity/590-joanna-lumley |title=Joanna Lumley's Charity Work, Events and Causes |work=Looktothestars.org |accessdate=21 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, Lumley became a Patron of the Finchley Society.

From 2012 to 2016, Lumley supported the now-defunct proposals for a pedestrian "[[Garden Bridge]]" across the [[River Thames|Thames]] in London, in collaboration with the designer [[Thomas Heatherwick]] and former [[Mayor of London]] [[Boris Johnson]]. The proposals foundered at a cost of over £40 million of public money.&lt;ref name="OCeallaigh"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/ultratravel/the-next-big-thing/10120636/A-Garden-Bridge-across-the-Thames.html|title=A 'Garden Bridge' across the Thames|last=O'Ceallaigh|first=John|date=14 June 2013|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=31 July 2013|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/may/24/joanna-lumley-role-boris-johnson-thames-garden-bridge-london-thomas-heatherwick|title=How Joanna Lumley charmed 'dear Boris' to back her garden bridge dream|last=Townsend|first=Mark|date=23 May 2015|work=The Guardian|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/13/why-is-londons-garden-bridge-worth-as-much-as-five-lancashire-museums-ask-joanna-lumley|title=Why is London's Garden Bridge worth as much as five Lancashire museums?

In May 2009 she supported the [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green Party]] during the [[European Parliament election, 2009 (United Kingdom)|2009 European Elections]] campaign. For Lumley, the work of Green MEPs in the [[European Parliament]] in pursuing human rights and animal rights made the Green Party "the obvious choice" and urged UK voters "to cast a positive vote for a better future by voting Green in the European Elections."&lt;ref name='Independent_09-05-28'&gt;{{cite news | first = Nigel | last = Morris | title = Lumley goes Green in European elections | date = 28 May 2009 | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/lumley-goes-green-in-european-elections-1691811.html | work = The Independent |location=London | accessdate =17 January 2012 | quote = "I urge you to cast a positive vote for a better future by voting Green in the European elections"}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lumley also appeared in literature to support changing the British electoral system from [[first-past-the-post]] to [[Instant-runoff voting|alternative vote]] for electing Members of Parliament to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] in the [[United Kingdom Alternative Vote referendum, 2011|Alternative Vote referendum]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-12950712 | title= Benjamin Zephaniah 'airbrushed from Yes to AV leaflets' | publisher=BBC News | date=3 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 she donated [[pound sterling|£]]1,000 to [[Caroline Lucas]]'s campaign to become the first [[Green Party (UK)|Green]] MP during the 2010 General Election campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Simon Hattenstone |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2010/apr/03/joanna-lumley-interview |title=Joanna Lumley: 'I'm a happy person. But injustice I loathe' |work=The Guardian |accessdate=21 October 2012 |date=3 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lumley was one of several celebrities who endorsed the parliamentary candidacy of the [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green Party]]'s [[Caroline Lucas]] at the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|2015 general election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/apr/24/celebrities-sign-statement-support-caroline-lucas-not-green-party | title= Celebrities sign statement of support for Caroline Lucas – but not the Greens | work=The Guardian | location=London | first=Jessica | last=Elgot | date=24 April 2015 | accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2015, Lumley backed children's fairytales app "GivingTales" in aid of UNICEF together with other celebrities including [[Roger Moore]], [[Stephen Fry]],  [[Ewan McGregor]], [[Joan Collins]], [[Michael Caine]], [[David Walliams]], [[Charlotte Rampling]], [[Paul McKenna]] and [[Michael Ball (singer)|Michael Ball]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Roger Moore backs children's fairytales app in aid of Unicef|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jun/18/roger-moore-childrens-app-unicef-givingtales|work=The Guardian|location=London|date=18 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
