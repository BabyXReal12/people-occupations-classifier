From 2007 to 2010 he starred in the double BAFTA winning series ''[[Gavin &amp; Stacey]]'' as main character [[List of Gavin &amp; Stacey characters#Gavin Shipman|Gavin Shipman]], a kind-hearted young man who meets up with a girl he meets through their work phone calls and falls in love with her. The programme ran for three series with a Christmas special and received widespread critical acclaim.

==Work with James Corden==
{{Main|Horne &amp; Corden|Lesbian Vampire Killers}}
Since working on the BBC sitcom ''[[Gavin &amp; Stacey]]'', he has collaborated a number of times with its co-creator [[James Corden]]&lt;ref name="interview"/&gt;

Horne and Corden presented the ''Big Brother'' spin-off show ''[[Big Brother's Big Mouth]]''&lt;ref name="bbbm"/&gt; as guests in 2007 and were then regulars for the run covering [[E4 (channel)|E4]]'s ''[[Big Brother: Celebrity Hijack]]''

Together they presented the [[NME]] Shockwaves Awards&lt;ref name="blog"/&gt; in 2008 and a section of [[Comic Relief]] in March 2009.

In 2008 Horne and Corden toured the UK with a stand-up show in preparation for their BBC [[sketch show]] ''[[Horne &amp; Corden]]''.&lt;ref name="h&amp;amp;c"/&gt; The first episode was broadcast on show of 10 March 2009 on [[BBC Three]]. It was presented in front of a live audience, in a style reminiscent of ''[[Morecambe and Wise]]'' or ''[[The Two Ronnies]]''. A variety of pre-filmed sketches and live performances were included.

2009 also saw the release of ''[[Lesbian Vampire Killers]]'', a comedy horror film. Reviews of the film were largely negative.&lt;ref name="bbc200309"/&gt; It holds a 29% approval rating on review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] with an average score of 4/10.&lt;ref name="rotten"/&gt; James Christopher of ''[[The Times]]'' described it as "profoundly awful", stating that it is an "instantly forgettable lads' mag farce" and an "appalling waste of a perfectly decent title".&lt;ref name="james"/&gt; Allan Hunter of the ''[[Daily Express]]'' called it "badly written and hastily executed" and "takes all the easy options of bad taste, bosoms and body fluids".&lt;ref name="hunter"/&gt; Anthony Quin writing in ''[[The Independent]]'' gave the film 1 star out of 5, describing it as woeful and stating that Horne and Corden had "overstretched their appeal" and looked in danger of becoming today's [[Hale and Pace]].&lt;ref name="quinn"/&gt; [[Peter Bradshaw]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' described the film as "mostly pretty awful, but there are one or two crass laughs".&lt;ref name="bradshaw"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/mar/19/lesbian-vampire-killers-film-review Lesbian Vampire Killers], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 2009-03-20. Retrieved on 2009-03-21&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'', however, gave it a positive review; ''Sun'' reviewer the Sneak gave ''Lesbian Vampire Killers'' a rating of 3 out of 5, saying that "other reviewers will undoubtedly say that ''LVK'' is another British comic flop but the Sneak won't be driving that stake into its heart".&lt;ref name="sun190309"/&gt; Similarly, Nicholas Yanes of Scifipulse.net found it to be "a great [[B film]]" worth becoming a cult classic.&lt;ref name="scifi"/&gt; Whilst on the comedy panel show ''The King is Dead'' in September 2010, Corden commented that watching the film would be too harsh a punishment for prisoners being held at [[Guantanamo Bay]] and that it was "a pile of shit".&lt;ref name="king"/&gt;

Horne appeared alongside Corden in the CGI film ''[[Planet 51]]'', with a minor part voicing a soldier, Vesklin.

==Personal life==
Horne is a fan of [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur FC]], and is often seen at [[White Hart Lane]].
