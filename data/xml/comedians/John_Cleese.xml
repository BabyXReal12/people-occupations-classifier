'''John Marwood Cleese''' ({{IPAc-en|k|l|iː|z}}; born 27 October 1939) is an English actor, voice actor, comedian, screenwriter, and producer. He achieved success at the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] and as a scriptwriter and performer on ''[[The Frost Report]]''. In the late 1960s, he co-founded [[Monty Python]], the comedy troupe responsible for the [[sketch show]] ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'' and the four Monty Python films: ''[[And Now for Something Completely Different]]'', ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]'', ''[[Monty Python's Life of Brian|Life of Brian]]'' and ''[[Monty Python's The Meaning of Life|The Meaning of Life]]''.

In the mid-1970s, Cleese and his first wife, [[Connie Booth]], co-wrote and starred in the British sitcom ''[[Fawlty Towers]]'', with Cleese receiving the 1980 [[British Academy Television Award for Best Entertainment Performance|BAFTA for Best Entertainment Performance]]. Later, he co-starred with [[Kevin Kline]], [[Jamie Lee Curtis]], and former Python colleague [[Michael Palin]] in ''[[A Fish Called Wanda]]'' and ''[[Fierce Creatures]]'', both of which he also wrote. He also starred in ''[[Clockwise (film)|Clockwise]]'' and has appeared in many other films, including two ''[[James Bond (film series)|James Bond]]'' films as R and [[Q (James Bond)|Q]], two ''[[Harry Potter (film series)|Harry Potter]]'' films, and the last three ''[[Shrek (franchise)|Shrek]]'' films.

With ''[[Yes Minister]]'' writer [[Antony Jay]], he co-founded [[Video Arts]], a production company making entertaining training films. In 1976, Cleese co-founded ''[[The Secret Policeman's Ball]]'' benefit shows to raise funds for the human rights organisation [[Amnesty International]].

== Early life ==
Cleese was born in [[Weston-super-Mare]], Somerset, the only child of Reginald Francis Cleese (1893–1972), an insurance salesman, and his wife Muriel Evelyn (''née'' Cross; 1899–2000).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/20/John-Cleese.html |title=John Cleese Biography (1939–) |publisher=Filmreference.com |accessdate=14 June 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100204051924/http://www.filmreference.com/film/20/John-Cleese.html |archivedate=4 February 2010 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; His family's surname was originally Cheese, but his father had thought it was embarrassing and changed it when he enlisted in the [[British Army|Army]] during the [[First World War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Stadlen |first=Matthew |title=John Cleese says: 'I’ve finally found true love – in a fish and three cats’ |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/relationships/11157618/John-Cleese-says-Ive-finally-found-true-love-in-a-fish-and-three-cats.html |accessdate=11 November 2015 |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=13 October 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151105021521/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/relationships/11157618/John-Cleese-says-Ive-finally-found-true-love-in-a-fish-and-three-cats.html |archivedate=5 November 2015 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a child, Cleese supported [[Bristol City Football Club|Bristol City FC]] and [[Somerset County Cricket Club]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Raphael |first1=Amy |title=Ross and Brand were astoundingly tasteless |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2008/nov/29/john-cleese-interview |accessdate=23 November 2014 |work=The Guardian |date=29 November 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129084524/http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2008/nov/29/john-cleese-interview |archivedate=29 November 2014 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Bristol Funny List: 50 of the city's funniest men and women |url=https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/bristol-funny-list-50-citys-1582 |publisher=Bristol Live |accessdate=17 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cleese was educated at St Peter's Preparatory School, where he received a prize for [[English studies|English]] and did well at [[cricket (sport)|cricket]] and [[boxing]]. When he was 13, he was awarded an [[exhibition (scholarship)|exhibition]] at [[Clifton College]], an [[English public school]] in Bristol. He was already more than 6&amp;nbsp;feet (1.83&amp;nbsp;m) tall by then.

Cleese allegedly defaced the school grounds, as a prank, by painting footprints to suggest that the statue of [[Field Marshal]] [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|Earl Haig]] had got down from his plinth and gone to the toilet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sandiegomag.com/media/San-Diego-Magazine/March-2006/Silly-Walks-and-Dead-Parrots/ |title=San Diego Magazine, Silly Walks and Dead Parrots |publisher=Sandiegomag.com |accessdate=14 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928021220/http://www.sandiegomag.com/media/San-Diego-Magazine/March-2006/Silly-Walks-and-Dead-Parrots/ |archivedate=28 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cleese played cricket in the First XI and did well academically, passing 8 [[GCE Ordinary Level|O-Levels]] and 3 [[GCE Advanced Level|A-Levels]] in mathematics, physics, and chemistry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=John Cleese |url=http://www.cardinalfang.net/biographies/cleese_biog.html |publisher=Cardinal Fang's Python Site |accessdate=7 May 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723052835/http://www.cardinalfang.net/biographies/cleese_biog.html |archivedate=23 July 2011 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=John Cleese |url=http://www.leadingauthorities.com/agent/john-cleese.aspx |publisher=Leading Authorities |accessdate=7 May 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100910042226/http://www.leadingauthorities.com/Agent/John-Cleese.aspx |archivedate=10 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his autobiography ''So, Anyway'', he says that discovering, aged 17, he had not been made a house prefect by his housemaster affected his outlook: "It was not fair and therefore it was unworthy of my respect...

He could not go straight to [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], as the ending of [[conscription in the United Kingdom|National Service]] meant there were twice the usual number of applicants for places, so he returned to his prep school for two years&lt;ref name="fringe"&gt;''From Fringe to Flying Circus''&amp;nbsp;– 'Celebrating a Unique Generation of Comedy 1960–1980'&amp;nbsp;– Roger Wilmut, Eyre Methuen Ltd, 1980, {{ISBN|0-413-46950-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; to teach science, English, geography, history, and Latin&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailyllama.com/news/1999/llama090.html |title=John Cleese to Spend Five Years Tour As Professor at Cornell University |work=Daily Llama |date=18 January 1999 |accessdate=4 April 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326105229/http://www.dailyllama.com/news/1999/llama090.html |archivedate=26 March 2012 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; (he drew on his Latin teaching experience later for a scene in ''[[Life of Brian]]'', in which he corrects Brian's badly written Latin graffiti).&lt;ref&gt;Life of Brian commentary by Terry Jones, Terry Gilliam and Eric Idle&lt;/ref&gt; He then took up a place he had won at [[Downing College, Cambridge]], to read Law. He also joined the [[Footlights|Cambridge Footlights]]. He recalled that he went to the [[Cambridge Guildhall]], where each university society had a stall, and went up to the Footlights stall where he was asked if he could sing or dance. He replied "no" as he was not allowed to sing at his school because he was so bad, and if there was anything worse than his singing, it was his dancing. He was then asked "Well, what do you do?" to which he replied, "I make people laugh."&lt;ref name="fringe" /&gt;

At the Footlights theatrical club, he spent a lot of time with [[Tim Brooke-Taylor]] and [[Bill Oddie]] and met his future writing partner [[Graham Chapman]].&lt;ref name="fringe" /&gt; Cleese wrote extra material for the 1961 Footlights Revue ''I Thought I Saw It Move'',&lt;ref name="fringe" /&gt;&lt;ref name="footlights"&gt;''Footlights!''&amp;nbsp;– 'A Hundred Years of Cambridge Comedy'&amp;nbsp;– Robert Hewison, Methuen London Ltd, 1983, {{ISBN|0-413-51150-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and was Registrar for the Footlights Club during 1962. He was also in the cast of the 1962 Footlights Revue ''Double Take!''&lt;ref name="fringe" /&gt;&lt;ref name="footlights" /&gt; Cleese graduated from Cambridge in 1963 with a [[2:1]]. Despite his successes on ''[[The Frost Report]]'', his father would send him cuttings from ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' offering management jobs in places like [[Marks and Spencer]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Sunday Times]], 16 October 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
=== Pre-Python ===
Cleese was a scriptwriter, as well as a cast member, for the 1963 [[Cambridge Footlights Revue|Footlights Revue]] ''A Clump of Plinths''.&lt;ref name="fringe" /&gt;&lt;ref name="footlights" /&gt; The revue was so successful at the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] that it was renamed ''[[Cambridge Footlights Revue|Cambridge Circus]]'' and taken to the [[West End Theatre|West End]] in London and then on a tour of New Zealand and Broadway, with the cast also appearing in some of the revue's sketches on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' in October 1964.&lt;ref name="fringe" /&gt;

After ''Cambridge Circus'', Cleese briefly stayed in America, performing [[Broadway theatre|on]] and [[off-Broadway]]. While performing in the musical ''[[Half a Sixpence]]'',&lt;ref name="fringe" /&gt; Cleese met future Python [[Terry Gilliam]], as well as American actress Connie Booth, whom he married on 20 February 1968.&lt;ref name="fringe" /&gt; At their wedding at a Unitarian Church in Manhattan, the couple attempted to ensure an absence of any theistic language. "The only moment of disappointment," Cleese recalled, "came at the very end of the service when I discovered that I'd failed to excise one particular mention of the word 'God.'"&lt;ref&gt;Cleese, John (2014). New York: Crown Archetype, p. 318.&lt;/ref&gt; Later Booth would become a writing partner.

He was soon offered work as a writer with [[BBC Radio]], where he worked on several programmes, most notably as a sketch writer for ''[[Dick Emery|The Dick Emery Show]]''. The success of the Footlights Revue led to the recording of a short series of half-hour radio programmes, called ''[[I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again]]'', which were so popular that the BBC commissioned a regular series with the same title that ran from 1965 to 1974. Cleese returned to Britain and joined the cast.&lt;ref name="fringe" /&gt; In many episodes, he is credited as "John Otto Cleese" (according to Jem Roberts, this may have been due to the embarrassment of his actual middle name Marwood).&lt;ref&gt;P70, The Authorised History of I'm Sorry I Haven't A Clue; Jem Roberts {{ISBN|978-1-84809-132-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1965, Cleese and Chapman began writing on ''The Frost Report''. The writing staff chosen for ''The Frost Report'' consisted of a number of writers and performers who would go on to make names for themselves in comedy. They included co-performers from ''I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again'' and future [[The Goodies|Goodies]] [[Bill Oddie]] and [[Tim Brooke-Taylor]], and also [[Frank Muir]], [[Barry Cryer]], [[Marty Feldman]], [[Ronnie Barker]], [[Ronnie Corbett]], [[Dick Vosburgh]] and future Python members [[Eric Idle]], [[Terry Jones]], and [[Michael Palin]]. While working on ''The Frost Report'', the future Pythons developed the writing styles that would make their collaboration significant. Cleese's and Chapman's sketches often involved authority figures, some of whom were performed by Cleese, while Jones and Palin were both infatuated with filmed scenes that opened with idyllic countryside panoramas. Idle was one of those charged with writing [[David Frost]]'s monologue. During this period Cleese met and befriended influential British comedian [[Peter Cook]].

It was as a performer on ''The Frost Report'' that Cleese achieved his breakthrough on British television as a comedy actor, appearing as the tall, patrician figure in the classic ''[[class sketch]]'', contrasting comically in a line-up with the shorter, ''middle class'' [[Ronnie Barker]] and the even shorter, ''working class'' [[Ronnie Corbett]]. This series was so popular that in 1966 Cleese and Chapman were invited to work as writers and performers with Brooke-Taylor and Feldman on ''[[At Last the 1948 Show]]'',&lt;ref name="fringe" /&gt; during which time the ''[[Four Yorkshiremen sketch]]'' was written by all four writers/performers (the Four Yorkshiremen sketch is now better known as a [[Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl|Monty Python sketch]]).&lt;ref name="BrightRoss2001"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Morris Bright |author2=Robert Ross |title=Fawlty Towers: fully booked |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AH-FAAAAIAAJ |accessdate=29 September 2010 |year=2001 |publisher=BBC |isbn=978-0-563-53439-6 |page=60 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130607064408/http://books.google.com/books?id=AH-FAAAAIAAJ |archivedate=7 June 2013 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cleese and Chapman also wrote episodes for the first series of ''[[Doctor in the House (TV series)|Doctor in the House]]'' (and later Cleese wrote six episodes of ''[[Doctor at Large (TV series)|Doctor at Large]]'' on his own in 1971). These series were successful, and in 1969 Cleese and Chapman were offered their very own series. However, owing to Chapman's alcoholism, Cleese found himself bearing an increasing workload in the partnership and was, therefore, unenthusiastic about doing a series with just the two of them. He had found working with Palin on ''The Frost Report'' an enjoyable experience and invited him to join the series. Palin had previously been working on ''[[Do Not Adjust Your Set]]'' with Idle and Jones, with Terry Gilliam creating the animations. The four of them had, on the back of the success of ''Do Not Adjust Your Set'', been offered a series for [[Thames Television]], which they were waiting to begin when Cleese's offer arrived. Palin agreed to work with Cleese and Chapman in the meantime, bringing with him Gilliam, Jones, and Idle.

=== Monty Python ===
''Monty Python's Flying Circus'' ran for four seasons from October 1969 to December 1974 on [[BBC Television]], though Cleese quit the show after the third. Cleese's two primary characterisations were as a sophisticated and a stressed-out loony. He portrayed the former as a series of announcers, TV show hosts, and government officials (for example, "[[The Ministry of Silly Walks]]"). The latter is perhaps best represented in the "[[Cheese Shop Sketch|Cheese Shop]]" and by Cleese's [[Mr Praline]] character, the man with a [[Dead Parrot sketch|dead Norwegian Blue parrot]] and a menagerie of other animals all named "Eric". He was also known for his working class "Sergeant Major" character, who worked as a Police Sergeant, Roman Centurion, etc. He is also seen as the opening announcer with the now famous line "And now for something completely different", although in its premiere in the sketch "Man with Three Buttocks", the phrase was spoken by Eric Idle.

==== Partnership with Graham Chapman ====
Along with Gilliam's animations, Cleese's work with Graham Chapman provided Python with its darkest and angriest moments, and many of his characters display the seething suppressed rage that later characterised his portrayal of [[Basil Fawlty]].

Unlike Palin and Jones, Cleese and Chapman wrote together in the same room; Cleese claims that their writing partnership involved Cleese doing most of the work, while Chapman sat back, not speaking for long periods before suddenly coming out with an idea that often elevated the sketch to a new level. A classic example of this is the "[[Dead Parrot sketch]]", envisaged by Cleese as a satire on poor customer service, which was originally to have involved a broken toaster and later a broken car (this version was actually performed and broadcast on the pre-Python special ''[[How to Irritate People]]''). It was Chapman's suggestion to change the faulty item into a dead parrot, and he also suggested that the parrot be specifically a "Norwegian Blue", giving the sketch a [[Surrealism|surreal]] air which made it far more memorable.

Their humour often involved [[Everyman|ordinary people]] in ordinary situations behaving absurdly for no obvious reason. Like Chapman, Cleese's [[Deadpan|poker face]], clipped middle class accent, and intimidating height allowed him to appear convincingly as a variety of authority figures, such as policemen, detectives, Nazi officers or government officials—which he would then proceed to undermine. Most famously, in the "[[Ministry of Silly Walks]]" sketch (actually written by Palin and Jones), Cleese exploits his stature as the crane-legged civil servant performing a grotesquely elaborate walk to his office.

Chapman and Cleese also specialised in sketches where two characters would conduct highly articulate arguments over completely arbitrary subjects, such as in the "cheese shop", the "dead parrot" sketch and "[[Argument Clinic]]", where Cleese plays a stone-faced bureaucrat employed to sit behind a desk and engage people in pointless, trivial bickering. All of these roles were opposite Palin (who Cleese often claims is his favourite Python to work with)—the comic contrast between the towering Cleese's crazed aggression and the shorter Palin's shuffling inoffensiveness is a common feature in the series. Occasionally, the typical Cleese–Palin dynamic is reversed, as in "[[Fish Licence]]", wherein Palin plays the bureaucrat with whom Cleese is trying to work.

Though the programme lasted four series, by the start of series 3, Cleese was growing tired of dealing with Chapman's alcoholism. He felt, too, that the show's scripts had declined in quality. For these reasons, he became restless and decided to move on. Though he stayed for the third series, he officially left the group before the fourth season. Despite this, he remained friendly with the group, and all six began writing ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]''; Cleese received a credit on three episodes of the fourth series which used material from these sessions, though he was officially unconnected with the fourth series. Cleese returned to the troupe to co-write and co-star in the Monty Python films ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]'', ''[[Monty Python's Life of Brian]]'' and ''[[Monty Python's The Meaning of Life]]'', and participated in various live performances over the years.

=== Post-Python activities ===
From 1970 to 1973, Cleese served as [[rector of the University of St Andrews]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://foi.st-andrews.ac.uk/doc.jsp?id=295 |title=List of Rectors of University of St. Andrews |accessdate=18 August 2013 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050114000125/http://foi.st-andrews.ac.uk/doc.jsp?id=295 |archivedate=14 January 2005 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His election proved a milestone for the university, revolutionising and modernising the post. For instance, the rector was traditionally entitled to appoint an "Assessor", a deputy to sit in his place at important meetings in his absence. Cleese changed this into a position for a student, elected across campus by the student body, resulting in direct access and representation for the student body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=John Cleese Biography |url=http://www.cardinalfang.net/biographies/cleese_biog.html |publisher=Cardinal fang |accessdate=8 October 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009130013/http://www.cardinalfang.net/biographies/cleese_biog.html |archivedate=9 October 2011 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around this time, Cleese worked with comedian [[Les Dawson]] on his sketch/stand-up show ''[[Sez Les]]''. The differences between the two physically (the tall, lean Cleese and the short, stout Dawson) and socially (the public school, and then Cambridge-educated Cleese and the working class, self-educated [[Manchester|Mancunian]] Dawson) were marked, but both worked well together from series 8 onwards until the series ended in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Andy Lowe |url=http://www.bubblegun.com/features/cleese.html |title=30 Things You Genuinely Never Knew About John Cleese |publisher=Bubblegun.com |accessdate=4 April 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422113142/http://www.bubblegun.com/features/cleese.html |archivedate=22 April 2012 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/correspondents/2008/01/15/6271/why_well_never_know_the_real_les_dawson |title=Why we'll never know the real Les Dawson : Correspondents 2008 : Chortle : The UK Comedy Guide |publisher=Chortle |date=15 January 2008 |accessdate=4 April 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111105025011/http://chortle.co.uk/correspondents/2008/01/15/6271/why_well_never_know_the_real_les_dawson |archivedate=5 November 2011 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''Fawlty Towers'' ====
{{Main|Fawlty Towers}}
Cleese achieved greater prominence in the United Kingdom as the neurotic hotel manager [[Basil Fawlty]] in ''Fawlty Towers'', which he co-wrote with his wife [[Connie Booth]]. The series won three [[BAFTA]] awards when produced and in 2000, it topped the [[British Film Institute]]'s list of the [[100 Greatest British Television Programmes]]. The series also featured [[Prunella Scales]] as Basil's acerbic wife [[Sybil Fawlty|Sybil]], [[Andrew Sachs]] as the much abused Spanish waiter Manuel ("...&amp;nbsp;he's from [[Barcelona]]"), and Booth as waitress Polly, the series' voice of sanity. Cleese based Basil Fawlty on a real person, [[Donald Sinclair (hotel owner)|Donald Sinclair]], whom he had encountered in 1970 while the Monty Python team were staying at the Gleneagles Hotel in [[Torquay]] while filming inserts for their television series. Reportedly, Cleese was inspired by Sinclair's mantra, "I could run this hotel just fine if it weren't for the guests." He later described Sinclair as "the most wonderfully rude man I have ever met," although Sinclair's widow has said her husband was totally misrepresented in the series. During the Pythons' stay, Sinclair allegedly threw Idle's briefcase out of the hotel "in case it contained a bomb," complained about Gilliam's "American" table manners, and threw a bus timetable at another guest after they dared to ask the time of the next bus to town.

The first series was screened from 19 September 1975 on [[BBC Two|BBC 2]], initially to poor reviews,&lt;ref name="Malmo"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Milmo |first1=Cahal |title=Life after Polly: Connie Booth (a case of Fawlty memory syndrome) |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/life-after-polly-connie-booth-a-case-of-fawlty-memory-syndrome-450289.html |accessdate=8 October 2015 |work=Independent |date=25 May 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502123852/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/life-after-polly-connie-booth-a-case-of-fawlty-memory-syndrome-450289.html |archivedate=2 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; but gained momentum when repeated on [[BBC One|BBC 1]] the following year. Despite this, a second series did not air until 1979, by which time Cleese's marriage to Booth had ended, but they revived their collaboration for the second series. ''Fawlty Towers'' consisted of only twelve episodes; Cleese and Booth both maintain that this was to avoid compromising the quality of the series.

In December 1977, Cleese appeared as a guest star on ''[[The Muppet Show]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Garlen |first1=Jennifer C. |last2=Graham |first2=Anissa M. |title=Kermit Culture: Critical Perspectives on Jim Henson's Muppets |year=2009 |publisher=McFarland &amp; Company |isbn=0-7864-4259-X |page=218}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cleese was a fan of the show and co-wrote much of the episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.muppetcentral.com/guides/episodes/tms/season2/47_cleese.shtml |title=John Cleese&amp;nbsp;– Episode 47 |accessdate=20 December 2008 |publisher=Muppet Central |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081229022312/http://www.muppetcentral.com/guides/episodes/tms/season2/47_cleese.shtml |archivedate=29 December 2008 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Cleese also made a cameo appearance in their 1981 film ''[[The Great Muppet Caper]]''.

Cleese won the ''[[TV Times]]'' award for Funniest Man on TV&amp;nbsp;– 1978–79.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.savemeaticket.com/event/theatre/entertainment/john-cleese-tickets |title=John Cleese |publisher=Save me a ticket |accessdate=12 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110409230952/http://www.savemeaticket.com/event/theatre/entertainment/john-cleese-tickets |archivedate=9 April 2011 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1980s and 1990s ===
During the 1980s and 1990s, Cleese focused on film, though he did work with [[Peter Cook]] in his one-off TV special ''Peter Cook and Co.'' in 1980. In the same year, Cleese played [[Petruchio]], in [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'' in the [[BBC Television Shakespeare]] series. In 1981 he starred with [[Sean Connery]] and Michael Palin in the [[Terry Gilliam]]-directed ''[[Time Bandits]]'' as [[Robin Hood]]. He also participated in ''[[Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl]]'' (1982) and starred in ''[[The Secret Policeman's Ball (1979)|The Secret Policeman's Ball]]'' for [[Amnesty International]]. In 1985, Cleese had a small dramatic role as a sheriff in ''[[Silverado (film)|Silverado]]'', which had an all-star cast that included [[Kevin Kline]], with whom he would star in ''[[A Fish Called Wanda]]'' three years later. In 1986, he starred in ''[[Clockwise (film)|Clockwise]]'' as an uptight school headmaster obsessed with punctuality and constantly getting into trouble during a journey to speak at the [[Headmasters' Conference]].

[[File:John Cleese at 1989 Oscars.jpg|thumb|upright|Cleese at the 1989 [[Academy Award]]s]]Timed with the 1987 UK elections, he appeared in a video promoting [[proportional representation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.topix.com/forum/world/canada/TCCS4ILPTT6OD8FVD |title=YouTube&amp;nbsp;– John Cleese Explains Proportional Representation for Canada &amp; Ontario changes Coming |publisher=Topix |accessdate=14 June 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307222316/http://www.topix.com/forum/world/canada/TCCS4ILPTT6OD8FVD |archivedate=7 March 2012 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, he wrote and starred in ''[[A Fish Called Wanda]]'' as the lead, Archie Leach, along with [[Jamie Lee Curtis]], [[Kevin Kline]], and Michael Palin. ''Wanda'' was a commercial and critical success, and Cleese was nominated for an [[Academy Award]] for his script. [[Cynthia Cleese]] starred as Leach's daughter.

Graham Chapman was diagnosed with [[Esophageal cancer|throat cancer]] in 1989; Cleese, Michael Palin, Peter Cook, and Chapman's partner [[David Sherlock]], witnessed Chapman's death. Chapman's death occurred a day before the 20th anniversary of the first broadcast of ''Flying Circus'', with Jones commenting, "the worst case of party-pooping in all history." Cleese's eulogy at Chapman's memorial service—in which he "became the first person ever at a British memorial service to say 'fuck'"—has since become legendary.&lt;ref&gt;Cleese continued to openly say the word, most notably reported in an interview hosted by Robert Klein, in which Cleese remarked that Chapman is "stone-fucking-dead!"[http://www.cardinalfang.net/misc/chapman_memorial.html Memorial eulogy by John Cleese for Graham Chapman] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120801025612/http://www.cardinalfang.net/misc/chapman_memorial.html |date=1 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cleese would later play a supporting role in [[Kenneth Branagh]]'s adaptation of ''[[Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (film)|Mary Shelley's Frankenstein]]'' alongside Branagh himself and [[Robert De Niro]]. He also produced and acted in a number of successful business training films, including ''[[Meetings, Bloody Meetings]],'' and ''[[More Bloody Meetings]]''. These were produced by his company [[Video Arts]].

With [[Robin Skynner]], the [[Group analysis|group analyst]] and [[Family therapy|family therapist]], Cleese wrote two books on relationships: ''[[Families and How to Survive Them]]'', and ''[[Life and How to Survive It]]''. The books are presented as a dialogue between Skynner and Cleese.

In 1996, Cleese [[List of people who have declined a British honour|declined the British honour of]] Commander of the [[Order of the British Empire]] (CBE). The follow-up to ''A Fish Called Wanda'', ''[[Fierce Creatures]]''—which again starred Cleese alongside Kevin Kline, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Michael Palin—was also released that year, but was greeted with mixed reception by critics and audiences. Cleese has since often stated that making the second film had been a mistake. When asked by his friend, director and restaurant critic [[Michael Winner]], what he would do differently if he could live his life again, Cleese responded, "I wouldn't have married [[Alyce Faye Eichelberger]] and I wouldn't have made ''Fierce Creatures''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/food_and_drink/eating_out/winners_dinners/article4275153.ece |title=Restaurant review: Michael Winner at Villa Principe Leopoldo, Switzerland |work=The Sunday Times |location=UK |date=6 July 2008 |accessdate=3 August 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202234740/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/food_and_drink/eating_out/winners_dinners/article4275153.ece |archivedate=2 December 2008 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, Cleese appeared in the [[James Bond]] film, ''[[The World Is Not Enough]]'' as [[Q (James Bond)|Q's]] assistant, referred to by Bond as "R". In 2002, when Cleese reprised his role in ''[[Die Another Day]]'', the character was promoted, making Cleese the new quartermaster (Q) of [[MI6]]. In 2004, Cleese was featured as Q in the video game ''[[James Bond 007: Everything or Nothing]]'', featuring his likeness and voice. Cleese did not appear in the subsequent Bond films, ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]'', ''[[Quantum of Solace]]'' and ''[[Skyfall]]''; in the latter film, [[Ben Whishaw]] was cast in the role of Q.

=== 2000s and 2010s ===
Cleese is Provost's Visiting Professor at [[Cornell University]], after having been [[Andrew D. White]] Professor-at-Large from 1999 to 2006. He makes occasional well-received appearances on the Cornell campus.

In 2001, Cleese was cast in the comedy ''[[Rat Race (film)|Rat Race]]'' as the eccentric hotel owner Donald P. Sinclair, the name of the [[Torquay]] hotel owner on whom he had based the character of Basil Fawlty. In 2002, Cleese made a cameo appearance in the film ''[[The Adventures of Pluto Nash]]'' in which he played "James", a computerised chauffeur of a hover car stolen by the title character (played by [[Eddie Murphy]]). The vehicle is subsequently destroyed in a chase, leaving the chauffeur stranded in a remote place on the moon. In 2003, Cleese appeared as Lyle Finster on the US sitcom ''[[Will &amp; Grace]]''. His character's daughter, Lorraine, was played by [[Minnie Driver]]. In the series, Lyle Finster briefly marries [[Karen Walker (Will &amp; Grace)|Karen Walker]] ([[Megan Mullally]]). In 2004, Cleese was credited as co-writer of a [[DC Comics]] [[graphic novel]] titled ''[[Superman: True Brit]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cowsill |first=Alan |last2=Dolan |first2=Hannah, ed. |chapter=2000s |title=DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle |publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-7566-6742-9 |page=315 |quote=Comedy legend John Cleese joined forces with artist John Byrne, inker Mark Farmer and writer Kim Johnson for a unique take on the Superman story.

From 10 November to 9 December 2005, Cleese toured New Zealand with his stage show, ''John Cleese—His Life, Times and Current Medical Problems''. Cleese described it as "a [[one-man show]] with several people in it, which pushes the envelope of acceptable behaviour in new and disgusting ways." The show was developed in New York City with [[William Goldman]] and includes Cleese's daughter Camilla as a writer and actor (the shows were directed by Australian [[Bille Brown]]). His assistant of many years, Garry Scott-Irvine, also appeared and was listed as a co-producer. The show then played in universities in California and [[Arizona]] from 10 January to 25 March 2006 under the title "Seven Ways to Skin an Ocelot".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/97589.html |title=John Cleese Brings Seven Ways to Skin an Ocelot to U.S. |work=Playbill |accessdate=14 June 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011212747/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/97589.html |archivedate=11 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; His voice can be downloaded for directional guidance purposes as a downloadable option on some personal [[Global Positioning System|GPS]]-navigation device models by company [[TomTom]].

In a 2005 poll of comedians and comedy insiders, ''The Comedians' Comedian'', Cleese was voted second only to [[Peter Cook]]. Also in 2005, a long-standing piece of Internet humour, "The Revocation of Independence of the United States", was wrongly attributed to Cleese. In 2006, Cleese hosted a television special of football's greatest kicks, goals, saves, bloopers, plays, and penalties, as well as football's influence on culture (including the famous Monty Python sketch "Philosophy Football"), featuring interviews with pop culture icons [[David A. Stewart|Dave Stewart]], [[Dennis Hopper]], and [[Henry Kissinger]], as well as eminent footballers including [[Pelé]], [[Mia Hamm]], and [[Thierry Henry]]. ''The Art of Soccer with John Cleese''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bfsent.com/item_detail.asp?number=30895 |title=Art of Soccer, The With John Cleese |publisher=Bfsent.com |accessdate=14 June 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707231506/http://www.bfsent.com/item_detail.asp?number=30895 |archivedate=7 July 2011 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; was released in North America on DVD in January 2009 by BFS Entertainment &amp; Multimedia. Also in 2006, Cleese released the song "[[Don't Mention the World Cup]]".

Cleese lent his voice to the [[BioWare]] video game ''[[Jade Empire]]''. His role was that of an "outlander" named Sir Roderick Ponce von Fontlebottom the Magnificent Bastard, stranded in the Imperial City of the Jade Empire. His character is essentially a British [[colonialism|colonialist]] stereotype who refers to the people of the Jade Empire as "savages in need of enlightenment". His armour has the design of a fork stuck in a piece of cheese. He also had a cameo appearance in the computer game ''[[Starship Titanic]]'' as "The Bomb" (credited as "Kim Bread"), designed by [[Douglas Adams]].

In 2007, Cleese appeared in ads for [[Titleist]] as a golf course designer named "Ian MacCallister", who represents "Golf Designers Against Distance". Also in 2007, he started filming the sequel to ''[[The Pink Panther (2006 film)|The Pink Panther]]'', titled ''[[The Pink Panther 2]]'', with [[Steve Martin]] and [[Aishwarya Rai]]. On 27 September 2007, Cleese announced he was to produce a series of video podcasts called HEADCAST. Cleese released the first episode of this series in April 2008 on his own website, headcast.co.uk.

Cleese collaborated with [[Los Angeles Guitar Quartet]] member [[William Kanengiser]] in 2008 on the text to the performance piece "The Ingenious Gentleman of La Mancha". Cleese, as narrator, and the LAGQ premiered the work in [[Santa Barbara County, California|Santa Barbara]]. 2008 also saw reports of Cleese working on a musical version of ''A Fish Called Wanda'' with his daughter Camilla.

At the end of March 2009, Cleese published his first article as 'Contributing Editor' to ''[[The Spectator]]'': "The real reason I had to join ''The Spectator''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/i//the-magazine/features/3472446/the-real-reason-i-had-to-join-the-spectator.thtml |title=The real reason I had to join |work=The Spectator |location=UK |date=25 March 2009 |accessdate=14 June 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090330060944/http://www.spectator.co.uk/i/the-magazine/features/3472446/the-real-reason-i-had-to-join-the-spectator.thtml |archivedate=30 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cleese has also hosted comedy galas at the [[Montreal]] [[Just for Laughs]] comedy festival in 2006, and again in 2009. Towards the end of 2009 and into 2010, Cleese appeared in a series of television adverts for the Norwegian electric goods shop chain, [[Elkjøp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dagbladet.no/2009/09/23/kjendis/tv/tv_og_medier/reklame/elkjop/8259273/ |title=John Cleese i Elkjøp-reklame |last=Ottosen |first=Peder |publisher=Kjendis.no |accessdate=17 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2010 it was announced that Cleese would be playing Jasper in the video game ''[[Fable III]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Brudvig |first=Erik |url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/107/1076735p1.html |title=GDC 10: Designing Fable III&amp;nbsp;– Xbox 360 Preview at IGN |publisher=Xbox360.ign.com |date=11 March 2010 |accessdate=14 June 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100419055442/http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/107/1076735p1.html |archivedate=19 April 2010 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 and 2010, Cleese toured [[Scandinavia]] and the US with his Alimony Tour Year One and Year Two. In May 2010, it was announced that this tour would extend to the UK (his first tour in the UK), set for May 2011. The show is dubbed the "Alimony Tour" in reference to the financial implications of Cleese's divorce. The UK tour started in [[Cambridge]] on 3 May, visiting [[Birmingham]], [[Nottingham]], [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]], [[York]], Liverpool, [[Leeds]], Glasgow, [[Edinburgh]], [[Oxford]], Bristol and [[Bath (England)|Bath]] (the Alimony Tour DVD was recorded on 2 July, the final Bath date).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/bristol/hi/people_and_places/arts_and_culture/newsid_8695000/8695560.stm |title=BBC&amp;nbsp;– Ex-Python John Cleese goes on first UK tour, aged 71 |publisher=BBC News |date=20 May 2010 |accessdate=14 June 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100523042254/http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/bristol/hi/people_and_places/arts_and_culture/newsid_8695000/8695560.stm |archivedate=23 May 2010 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 2011 John took his Alimony Tour to South Africa.

In May 2012 he did a week run of shows in [[Dubai]] in the [[United Arab Emirates]]. Entitled 'An Evening with John Cleese' he was at the Madinat Theatre, Souk Madinat Jumeirah.

In 2012, Cleese was cast in ''Hunting Elephants'', an upcoming [[heist film|heist]] comedy by [[Israelis|Israeli]] filmmaker Reshef Levi. Cleese had to quit just prior to filming due to heart trouble and was replaced by [[Patrick Stewart]].&lt;ref name="he1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haaretz.com/culture/british-actor-john-cleese-to-appear-in-israeli-heist-comedy-1.431056 |title=British actor John Cleese to appear in Israeli heist comedy |last=Anderman |first=Irit |date=17 May 2012 |work=[[Haaretz]] |accessdate=17 May 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120701122914/http://www.haaretz.com/culture/british-actor-john-cleese-to-appear-in-israeli-heist-comedy-1.431056 |archivedate=1 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="he2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/cannes-john-cleese-hunting-elephants-325570 |title=Cannes 2012: John Cleese Joins Israeli Comedy 'Hunting Elephants' |last=Roxborough |first=Scott |date=16 May 2012 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |accessdate=17 May 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120520053817/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/cannes-john-cleese-hunting-elephants-325570 |archivedate=20 May 2012 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="he3"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4266862,00.html |title=Cleese replaced by Stewart |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121120150628/http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4266862,00.html |archivedate=20 November 2012 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between September and October 2013, Cleese embarked on his first ever cross-Canada comedy tour.

=== Admiration for black humour ===
In his ''Alimony Tour'' Cleese explained the origin of his fondness for black humour, the only thing that he inherited from his mother. Examples of it are the [[Dead Parrot sketch]], "[[The Kipper and the Corpse]]" episode of ''Fawlty Towers'', his clip for the 1992 BBC2 mockumentary "A Question of Taste", the [[Undertakers sketch]], the [[Mr Creosote]] character in ''The Meaning of Life'', and [[Dead Parrot sketch#Further uses|his eulogy]] at Graham Chapman's memorial service.

Cleese blamed his mother, who lived to the age of 101, for his problems in relationships with women, saying: "It cannot be a coincidence that I spent such a large part of my life in some form of therapy and that the vast majority of the problems I was dealing with involved relationships with women."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.express.co.uk/life-style/life/516788/I-blame-my-mother-for-my-fawlty-love-life-says-John-Cleese |title=I blame my mother for my fawlty love life, says John Cleese |work=Daily Express}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Politics ==
A long-running supporter of the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Connolly |first1=Nancy |title=Actor, comedian and former Bath resident John Cleese lends his weight (and height) to Bath Lib Dems |url=http://www.bathchronicle.co.uk/Actor-comedian-Bath-resident-John-Cleese-lends/story-26438995-detail/story.html |accessdate=8 October 2015 |work=Bath Chronicle |date=4 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151012044453/http://www.bathchronicle.co.uk/Actor-comedian-Bath-resident-John-Cleese-lends/story-26438995-detail/story.html |archivedate=12 October 2015 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; having previously been a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour party]] voter, Cleese switched to the [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|SDP]] after their formation in 1981, and during the [[United Kingdom general election, 1987|1987 general election]], Cleese recorded a nine-minute party political broadcast for the [[SDP–Liberal Alliance]], which spoke about the similarities and failures of the other two parties in a more humorous tone than standard political broadcasts. Cleese has since appeared in broadcasts for the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997 general election]] and narrating a radio election broadcast for the party during the [[United Kingdom general election, 2001|2001 general election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/vote2001/hi/english/newsid_1361000/1361458.stm |title=Lib Dems plan warmer homes |publisher=BBC News |date=31 May 2001 |accessdate=21 July 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219210901/http://news.bbc.co.uk/vote2001/hi/english/newsid_1361000/1361458.stm |archivedate=19 December 2008 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Cleese expressed support for [[Barack Obama]] and his [[Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2008|presidential candidacy]], offering his services as a speech writer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2008-04-09/news/17895834_1_monty-python-obama-s-campaign-speechwriter |title='Monty Python' icon John Cleese stumps to be Barack Obama's speechwriter |work=Daily News |location=New York |date=9 April 2008 |accessdate=14 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was an outspoken critic of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Vice-Presidential candidate [[Sarah Palin]], saying that "Michael Palin is no longer the funniest Palin".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=John |last1=Cleese |url=http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/b63785_John_Cleese__Sarah_Palin_Funnier_Than_Michael_Palin.html |title=John Cleese: Sarah Palin Funnier Than Michael Palin |first2=Erik |last2=Pedersen |publisher=E! |date=14 October 2008 |accessdate=14 June 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616180442/http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/b63785_John_Cleese__Sarah_Palin_Funnier_Than_Michael_Palin.html |archivedate=16 June 2010 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, he wrote a satirical poem about [[Fox News]] commentator [[Sean Hannity]] for ''[[Countdown with Keith Olbermann]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailykos.com/story/2008/10/8/21536/7048 "John Cleese Destroys Sean Hannity with Poetry"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091112180552/http://www.dailykos.com/story/2008/10/8/21536/7048 |date=12 November 2009 }} Daily Kos.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Cleese declared his appreciation for Britain's coalition government between the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] and Liberal Democrats, saying: "I think what's happening at the moment is rather interesting. The Coalition has made everything a little more courteous and a little more flexible. I think it was quite good that the Liberal Democrats had to compromise a bit with the Tories." He also criticised the previous [[New Labour|Labour]] government, commenting: "Although my inclinations are slightly [[Centre-left politics|left-of-centre]], I was terribly disappointed with the last Labour government. [[Gordon Brown]] lacked emotional intelligence and was never a leader." Cleese also declared his support for [[proportional representation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/8279180/David-Cameron-impresses-John-Cleese-with-his-good-manners.html |title=David Cameron impresses John Cleese with his good manners |work=The Daily Telegraph |first=Tim |last=Walker |date=25 January 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160624175146/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/8279180/David-Cameron-impresses-John-Cleese-with-his-good-manners.html |archivedate=24 June 2016 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, Cleese revealed that he had declined a [[life peerage]] for political services in 1999. Outgoing leader of the Liberal Democrats [[Paddy Ashdown]] had put forward the suggestion shortly before stepping down, with the idea that Cleese would take the party whip and sit as a working peer, but the actor quipped that he "realised this involved being in England in the winter and I thought that was too much of a price to pay."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nikkhah |first=Roya |title=Lord Cleese of Fawlty Towers: Why John Cleese declined a peerage |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/8455538/Lord-Cleese-of-Fawlty-Towers-Why-John-Cleese-declined-a-peerage.html |work=[[The Sunday Telegraph]] |date=17 April 2011 |accessdate=17 April 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110420075708/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/8455538/Lord-Cleese-of-Fawlty-Towers-Why-John-Cleese-declined-a-peerage.html |archivedate=20 April 2011 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' in 2014, Cleese expressed political interest with regard to the [[UK Independence Party]], saying that although he was in doubt as to whether he was prepared to vote for it, he was attracted to its challenge to the established political order and the radicalism of its policies with regard to the United Kingdom's membership of the [[European Union]]. He expressed support for immigration, but also concern about the integration of immigrants into British culture.&lt;ref name="stadlen"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/relationships/11157618/John-Cleese-says-Ive-finally-found-true-love-in-a-fish-and-three-cats.html |title=John Cleese says: 'I’ve finally found true love – in a fish and three cats’ |work=The Daily Telegraph |first=Matthew |last=Stadlen |date=13 October 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151105021521/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/relationships/11157618/John-Cleese-says-Ive-finally-found-true-love-in-a-fish-and-three-cats.html |archivedate=5 November 2015 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Talking to ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' in 2015, Cleese expressed a critical view on what he saw as a [[plutocracy]] that was unhealthily developing control of the governance of the [[First World]]'s societies, stating that he had reached a point when he "saw that our existence here is absolutely hopeless. I see the rich have got a stranglehold on us. If somebody had said that to me when I was 20, I would have regarded him as a [[Loony left|left-wing loony]]."&lt;ref name="spiegel.de" /&gt;

In 2016, Cleese publicly supported [[Brexit]] and the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union in the [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|referendum]] on the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Saul |first=Heather |title=Brexit: The famous figures celebrating the EU referendum result |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/brexit-the-famous-figures-celebrating-the-eu-referendum-result-a7102511.html |work=The Independent |date=25 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, two years later he announced that he was leaving the UK to relocate in the Caribbean island of [[Nevis]] partly over frustration over Brexit, including "dreadful lies" by the right concerning investment in public services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/celebrity-news/john-cleese-set-to-move-to-the-caribbean-over-disappointment-with-uk-a3884261.html|title=John Cleese set to move to the Caribbean over 'disappointment' with UK|newspaper=[[London Evening Standard]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During then-Republican nominee [[Donald Trump]]'s run for the US Presidency in 2016, Cleese described Trump as "a narcissist, with no attention span, who doesn't have clear ideas about anything and makes it all up as he goes along".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/news/donald-trump-narcissist-with-no-attention-span-says-john-cleese-35120288.html |title=Donald Trump narcissist with no attention span, says John Cleese |work=The Belfast Telegraph |date=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had previously described the leadership of the Republican Party as "the most cynical, most disgracefully immoral people I've ever come across in a Western civilisation".&lt;ref name="stadlen" /&gt;

== Anti-smoking campaign ==
In 1992, the UK Health Education Authority (subsequently the Health Development Agency, now merged into the [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]]) recruited Cleese — an ex-smoker — to star in a series of anti-smoking [[public service announcements]] (PSAs) on British television, which took the form of sketches rife with morbid humor about smoking and were designed to encourage adult smokers to quit.&lt;ref name="McVeyStapleton"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McVey |first1=Dominic |last2=Stapleton |first2=John |title=Can anti-smoking television advertising affect smoking behaviour? controlled trial of the Health Education Authority for England's anti-smoking TV campaign |journal=Tob Control |date=September 2000 |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=273-82 |doi=10.1136/tc.9.3.273 |pmid=10982571 |url=http://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/9/3/273 |accessdate=11 June 2018 |pmc=1748378}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a controlled study of regions of central and northern England, one region received no intervention, the PSAs were broadcast in two regions, and one region received both the PSAs plus locally-organised anti-tobacco campaigning.&lt;ref name="McVeyStapleton" /&gt; The study found that smokers in regions where the PSAs were broadcast were about half again as likely to have quit at the 18-month follow-up point as those who did not see them, irrespective of the local anti-tobacco campaign.&lt;ref name="McVeyStapleton" /&gt;

== Personal life ==
Cleese met [[Connie Booth]] in the US and they married in 1968.&lt;ref name="Malmo" /&gt; In 1971, Booth gave birth to Cynthia Cleese, their only child. With Booth, Cleese wrote the scripts for and co-starred in both series of ''Fawlty Towers'', even though the two were actually divorced before the second series was finished and aired. Cleese and Booth are said to have remained close friends since. Cleese has two grandchildren, Evan and Olivia, through his eldest daughter's marriage to [[Ed Solomon]].

Cleese married American actress [[Barbara Trentham]] in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nndb.com/people/124/000024052/ |title=John Cleese |publisher=Nndb.com |accessdate=14 June 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100623072003/http://www.nndb.com/people/124/000024052/ |archivedate=23 June 2010 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their daughter Camilla, Cleese's second child, was born in 1984. He and Trentham divorced in 1990. During this time, Cleese moved to [[Los Angeles]].

In 1992, he married American psychotherapist [[Alyce Faye Eichelberger]]. They divorced in 2008. The divorce settlement left Eichelberger with [[pound sterling|£]]12&amp;nbsp;million in finance and assets, including £600,000 a year for seven years. Cleese said, "What I find so unfair is that if we both died today, her children would get much more than mine ... I got off lightly. Think what I'd have had to pay Alyce if she had contributed anything to the relationship – such as children, or a conversation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/celebritynews/6043628/John-Cleese-in-12-million-divorce-settlement.html |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |title=John Cleese in £12&amp;nbsp;million divorce settlement |first=Andrew |last=Pierce |date=18 August 2009 |accessdate=6 May 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100407190653/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/celebritynews/6043628/John-Cleese-in-12-million-divorce-settlement.html |archivedate=7 April 2010 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2015, in an interview with ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', he was asked if he was religious. Cleese stated that he didn't think much of organised religion and said he was not committed to "anything except the vague feeling that there is something more going on than the materialist reductionist people think".&lt;ref name="spiegel.de"&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/spiegel-interview-with-john-cleese-a-1026293.html SPIEGEL Interview with John Cleese: 'Satire Makes People Think'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150526064531/http://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/spiegel-interview-with-john-cleese-a-1026293.html |date=26 May 2015 }}.

The project had been partly funded by Cleese's donation of the proceeds from the London premier of ''Fierce Creatures''.&lt;ref name=PBS_InTheWild /&gt;&lt;ref name=1998ScienceDaily&gt;{{cite web |title=Four More Lemurs To Be Released into Madagascar Jungle This Fall |work=Science Daily |publisher=Duke University |date=12 October 1998 |url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/1998/10/981012073550.htm |accessdate=28 December 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vKScRzZ5?url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/1998/10/981012073550.htm |archivedate=29 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cleese is quoted as saying, "I adore lemurs. They're extremely gentle, well-mannered, pretty and yet great fun&amp;nbsp;... I should have married one."&lt;ref name=2002DailyLlama /&gt;

The [[Bemaraha woolly lemur]] (''Avahi cleesei''), also known as Cleese's woolly lemur, is native to western Madagascar. The scientist who discovered the species named it after Cleese, mainly because of Cleese's fondness for lemurs and his efforts at protecting and preserving them. The species was first discovered in 1990 by a team of scientists from [[University of Zurich|Zurich University]] led by Urs Thalmann, but was not formally described as a species until 11 November 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Endangered lemurs get Fawlty name |date=11 November 2005 |publisher=BBC |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4427160.stm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100204075908/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4427160.stm |archivedate=4 February 2010 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* There is a municipal rubbish heap of {{convert|45|m}} in altitude that has been named Mt Cleese at the [[Awapuni, Palmerston North|Awapuni]] landfill just outside [[Palmerston North]] after he dubbed the city "suicide capital of New Zealand" after a stay there in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,21767448-1702,00.html Funnyman Cleese rubbishes NZ city] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010130657/http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,21767448-1702,00.html |date=10 October 2007 }}.

* The post-hardcore rock band [[I Set My Friends on Fire]] has a song on their ''[[You Can't Spell Slaughter Without Laughter]]'' album titled "Reese's Pieces, I Don't Know Who John Cleese Is?".
