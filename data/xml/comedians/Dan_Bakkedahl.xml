Dan went on to perform at the [[The Second City|Second City]] mainstage, eventually writing ''Doors Open on the Right'', [[The Second City|Second City]]’s 90th [[revue]]. In [[Chicago]], he is often noted for having left the Second City mainstage due to artistic differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last =Lara|first =Roland|title =Chicago Smart-Ass Makes Good|publisher =chicagoist.com|url =http://chicagoist.com/2005/09/20/chicago_smartass_makes_good.php|accessdate =2008-07-09|deadurl =yes|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20091104141500/http://chicagoist.com/2005/09/20/chicago_smartass_makes_good.php|archivedate =2009-11-04|df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After leaving ''The Daily Show'' in 2007, he has since moved to [[Los Angeles]] and went on to have supporting roles in the films such as ''[[Observe and Report]]'', ''[[The Heat (film)|The Heat]]'', and ''[[This Is 40]]''. He also appeared in the ''Snake 'N Bacon'' animated special on [[Adult Swim]], which aired on May 10, 2009. In early 2010, he co-starred in the comedy pilot ''Our Show'' on [[NBC]].

From 2010 through 2011, Bakkedahl appeared in a series of commercials for [[T-Mobile]] cellular phones, where he plays a human likeness of [[AT&amp;T]]'s 3G network.
