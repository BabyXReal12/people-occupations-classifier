'''Teri Ann Garr''' is a retired American actress, singer, dancer and voice artist.

She is perhaps best known for appearing in comedy films, including ''[[Young Frankenstein]]'' (1974), ''[[Mr. Mom]]'' (1983) and ''[[Tootsie]]'' (1982) which earned her a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for her role Sandra "Sandy" Lester.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1983|title=The 55th Academy Awards {{!}} 1983|work=Oscars.org {{!}} Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|access-date=2018-04-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her quick banter led to Garr being a regular guest on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' and [[David Letterman]]'s late night talk shows. She also appeared on television as [[List of Friends characters#Phoebe Abbott|Phoebe Abbott]] in three episodes of the sitcom ''[[Friends]]'' (1997–98).

[[File:TeriGarr HectorElizondo.jpg|thumb|right|Garr and [[Hector Elizondo]] on the set of ''[[Perfect Alibi (1995 film)|Perfect Alibi]]'' with director [[Kevin Meyer]]]] 

Garr began as a background [[Go-go dancing|go go dancer]] in uncredited roles in youth-oriented films and TV shows choreographed by Winters,&lt;ref name="imdb winters"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0935916|title=David Winters biodata|website=IMDb.com|publisher=Internet Movie Database|access-date=September 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; including ''[[Pajama Party (film)|Pajama Party]]'' (a [[beach party film]]), the ''[[T.A.M.I.

When asked in a magazine interview about how she landed jobs in so many Presley films, Garr answered, "One of the dancers in the road show of ''[[West Side Story]]'' ([[David Winters (choreographer)|David Winters]]) started to choreograph movies, and whatever job he got, I was one of the girls he'd hire. So he was chosen to do ''Viva Las Vegas''. That was my first movie."&lt;ref name="winters archive2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.davidwinters.net/archives2.htm|date=2004|title=Talkin' 'bout my g-g-g-generation|website=David Winters.net|access-date=April 7, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040302004146/http://www.davidwinters.net/archives2.htm|archivedate=March 2, 2004|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her first speaking role in a motion picture was a brief appearance as a [[damsel in distress]] in the [[The Monkees|Monkees]] film ''[[Head (film)|Head]]'' (1968), written by [[Jack Nicholson]]. She landed her first significant motion picture role in [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s ''[[The Conversation]]'' (1974). Her career breakthrough came in the [[Mel Brooks]] comedy ''[[Young Frankenstein]]'' (also 1974) as Inga.&lt;ref name="imdb"/&gt;

Garr was nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for her supporting role as [[Dustin Hoffman]]'s character's actress friend in ''[[Tootsie]]'' (1982).&lt;ref name="imdb"&gt;{{IMDb name|414|Teri Garr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She often appeared on television. She began as a go-go dancer on several musical [[variety show]]s, along with friend [[Toni Basil]], such as ''[[Shindig!]]'' and ''[[Hullabaloo (TV series)|Hullabaloo]]''. In 1966 Garr made one appearance on ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' (episode 7, uncredited).

In 1968, she was featured as secretary Roberta Lincoln in the ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' episode "[[Assignment: Earth]]", designed as a [[Backdoor pilots|backdoor pilot]] episode for a new series which was not commissioned. In the early 1970s, she was a regular cast member on ''[[The Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour]]'', dancing and acting in comedy sketches.&lt;ref name="imdb"/&gt;

==Personal life==
[[File:Teri Garr at the AIDS Project Los Angeles (APLA) benefit cropped.jpg|thumb|Garr at the [[AIDS Project Los Angeles]] (APLA) benefit, September 1990]]
Garr's daughter, Molly O'Neil, was born in November 1993. Garr married contractor John O'Neil on the day their adopted daughter was born. Garr and O'Neil divorced in 1996.&lt;ref name="imdb"/&gt;

===Health===
In October 2002, Garr publicly confirmed that she had been diagnosed with [[multiple sclerosis]].&lt;ref name="multiplesclerosis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/SHOWBIZ/News/10/08/teri.garr.ms|title=Teri Garr reveals she has multiple sclerosis|date=October 9, 2002|accessdate=June 5, 2007|work=CNN|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AGWfZ8xB?url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/SHOWBIZ/News/10/08/teri.garr.ms|archivedate=August 28, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After years of uncertainty and secrecy surrounding her diagnosis, Garr explained her reasons for deciding to go public: "I'm telling my story for the first time so I can help people. I can help people know they aren't alone and tell them there are reasons to be optimistic because, today, treatment options are available."&lt;ref name="multiplesclerosis"/&gt;

In interviews, she has commented that she first started noticing symptoms while in New York filming ''[[Tootsie]]''. After disclosing her condition, she became a National Ambassador for the [[National Multiple Sclerosis Society]] and National Chair for the Society's Women Against MS program (WAMS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news-medical.net/?id=1021|title=Actress Teri Garr named as multiple sclerosis national chairwoman|accessdate=June 5, 2007|date=April 29, 2004|work=News-Medical.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2005, Garr was honored as the society's Ambassador of the Year. This honor had been given only four times since the society was founded.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

''Closer'' reported in 2015 that she credited her positive attitude and support of her family as helping her fight the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.closerweekly.com/posts/exclusive-teri-garr-battles-multiple-sclerosis-stays-positive-67607|title=Teri Garr Battles Multiple Sclerosis With a Positive Outlook With the Help of Her Family|work=Closer Weekly|date=August 23, 2015|accessdate=December 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Garr suffered a ruptured [[brain aneurysm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Michelle|last=Tan|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20005817,00.html|title=Teri Garr Recovering from Brain Aneurysm|accessdate=June 5, 2007|work=People|date=January 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; After therapy, she regained speech and motor skills, and, in 2008 appeared on ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' to promote ''[[Expired]]'', a 2007 film in which she played a set of twins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=David Letterman-Teri Garr-June-19-2008|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYq5fk69dIY|publisher=Youtube|accessdate=7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
