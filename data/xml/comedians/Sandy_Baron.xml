'''Sandy Baron''' (born '''Sanford Irving Beresofsky'''; May 5, 1936 – January 21, 2001) was an American [[comedian]] who performed on stage, in films, and on television.

==Early life==
Sanford Beresofsky was born in Brooklyn, New York, grew up in the [[Brownsville, Brooklyn|Brownsville]] neighborhood and graduated from [[Thomas Jefferson High School (Brooklyn)|Thomas Jefferson High School]] in [[East New York, Brooklyn|East New York]]; and while he was a student at [[Brooklyn College]], to which he received a scholarship, changed his name to Sandy Baron—taking his inspiration from the nearby Barron's Bookstore.&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Is Anyone Here from Brooklyn? |first=Frank |last=Bisogno |year=1990 |publisher=Fradon Publishing |asin=B0006EV8V0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He started his career working in the [[Catskill Mountains]] resorts when they were synonymous with the "[[Borscht Belt]]" brand of [[Jewish]] humor on which Baron made his mark. He then moved on to the [[Compass Players]] Improv Comedy group in the late 1950s.

==Career==
He made his [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] debut in ''[[Tchin-Tchin]]'' in 1962. He also appeared in many other Broadway plays, hits as well as flops, including ''Autoro Ui'', ''Generations'' and ''Lenny'' (Los Angeles production); replacing [[Cliff Gorman]] in the lead role of [[Lenny Bruce]] on Broadway.

In 1964, he established a reputation for himself as part of ''[[That Was The Week That Was]]'' and as the opening act for [[Steve Lawrence]] and [[Eydie Gorme]] at the [[Copacabana (nightclub)|Copacabana]] in New York City. In the 1966-1967 season, Baron co-starred with [[Will Hutchins]] in the [[NBC]] [[sitcom]] ''[[Hey, Landlord]]'' about an apartment complex in [[Manhattan, New York|Manhattan]]. In the 1970s, he made regular appearances on talk shows such as ''[[The Mike Douglas Show]]'' and ''[[The Merv Griffin Show]]'', and multiple guest appearances on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]''.  Sandy was also co-host of ''The Della Reese Show'' and hosted a number of television talk shows including ''A.M. New York'' and ''Mid-Morning LA''. In addition, he was the host of the pilot for ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'' and often appeared as a celebrity contestant on this and other games shows.

He acted in many television programs, including a notable recurring role in ''[[Seinfeld]]'' as Jack Klompus, starred in ''[[Law &amp; Order]]'', and as [[Grandpa (The Munsters)|Grandpa]] in a 1996 TV-movie revival of ''[[The Munsters' Scary Little Christmas]]''.  His appearances in feature films included ''[[Sweet November (1968 film)|Sweet November]]'' (1968), ''[[Targets]]'' (1968), ''[[If It's Tuesday, This Must Be Belgium]]'' (1969), ''[[The Out-of-Towners (1970 film)|The Out-of-Towners]]'' (1970), ''[[Birdy (film)|Birdy]]'' (1984), and others. Along with several of his contemporaries, Baron played himself in the opening scene of Woody Allen's ''[[Broadway Danny Rose]]'' (1984); he also narrated this film.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/29/arts/sandy-baron-64-veteran-comic-who-antagonized-morty-seinfeld.html |title=Sandy Baron, 64, Veteran Comic Who Antagonized Morty Seinfeld |first=Lawrence |last=Van Gelder |authorlink=Lawrence Van Gelder |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=29 January 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baron wrote music, too, starting out at the [[Brill Building]] in New York with 1961 songs such as "Flying Blue Angels" and [[Adam Wade (singer)|Adam Wade]]'s "The Writing on The Wall", and later co-writing [[Lou Rawls]]' hit "A Natural Man" with [[Bobby Hebb]] ("[[Sunny (Bobby Hebb song)|Sunny]]") in 1971. Sandy wrote and recorded a number of comedy albums, including ''The Race Race'' and ''God Save the Queens'' co-written with Reverend James R. McGraw, editor/writer of [[Dick Gregory]]'s books.

Throughout his career, he opened for [[Neil Diamond]], [[The Fifth Dimension]], [[Bobby Vinton]], [[Anthony Newley]], [[Diana Ross]], and others.

==Personal life and death==
He was married to model/actress Geraldine Baron, writer/activist Mary Jo Webster Baron, and writer/screenwriter Stephanie Ericsson;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pr.harpercollins.com/author/microsite/about.aspx?authorid=2908 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20150414003303/http://pr.harpercollins.com/author/microsite/about.aspx?authorid=2908 |archivedate=2015-04-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; all ending in divorce.
