'''Richard Franklin Lennox Thomas Pryor''' (December 1, 1940&amp;nbsp;– December 10, 2005) was an American stand-up comedian, actor, and social critic. Pryor was known for uncompromising examinations of racism and topical contemporary issues, which employed vulgarities and profanity, as well as [[racial epithets]]. He reached a broad audience with his trenchant observations and storytelling style{{cn|date=February 2018}}, and is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential stand-up comedians of all time. 

Pryor's body of work includes the concert movies and recordings: ''[[Live &amp; Smokin'|Richard Pryor: Live &amp; Smokin']]'' (1971), ''[[That Nigger's Crazy]]'' (1974), ''[[...Is It Something I Said?]]'' (1975), ''[[Bicentennial Nigger]]'' (1976), ''[[Richard Pryor: Live in Concert]]'' (1979), ''[[Richard Pryor: Live on the Sunset Strip]]'' (1982), and ''[[Richard Pryor: Here and Now]]'' (1983). As an actor, he starred mainly in comedies such as ''[[Silver Streak (film)|Silver Streak]]'' (1976), but occasionally in dramas, such as [[Paul Schrader]]'s ''[[Blue Collar (film)|Blue Collar]]'' (1978), or action films, such as ''[[Superman III]]'' (1983). He collaborated on many projects with actor [[Gene Wilder]]. Another frequent collaborator was actor/comedian/writer [[Paul Mooney (comedian)|Paul Mooney]].

Pryor won an [[Emmy Award]] (1973) and five [[Grammy Award]]s (1974, 1975, 1976, 1981, and 1982). In 1974, he also won two American Academy of Humor awards and the [[Writers Guild of America Award]]. The first-ever [[Kennedy Center]] [[Mark Twain Prize for American Humor]] was presented to him in 1998. He was listed at number one on [[Comedy Central]]'s list of all-time greatest stand-up comedians.&lt;ref name=cc&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.voxmagazine.com/stories/2004/09/30/why-chappelle-is-the-man/ |title=Why Chappelle is the man |work=[[Columbia Missourian|Vox Magazine]] |date=September 30, 2004 |access-date=September 1, 2016 |quote=Pryor was voted No. 1 in Comedy Central's ''100 Greatest Stand-Ups of All Time'' in April. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914220958/http://archive.voxmagazine.com/stories/2004/09/30/why-chappelle-is-the-man/ |archivedate=September 14, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked him first on its list of the 50 best stand-up comics of all time.&lt;ref name = "RS"&gt;[https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/lists/50-best-stand-up-comics-of-all-time-w464199 The 50 Best Stand-up Comics of All Time].

==Early life==
Born on December 1, 1940 in [[Peoria, Illinois]], Richard Franklin Lennox Thomas Pryor grew up in the brothel run by his grandmother, Marie Carter, where his alcoholic mother, Gertrude L. (née Thomas), was a prostitute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/tv/richard_the_great_FmHiNQqrDQ08jcRI576TUI |title=Richard the Great |work=[[New York Post]] |accessdate=June 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, LeRoy "Buck Carter" Pryor (June 7, 1915&amp;nbsp;– September 27, 1968), was a former boxer and [[Hustling|hustler]].&lt;ref name="official"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://richardpryor.com/biography.php|website=RichardPryor.com|title= Richard Pryor's official biography}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Gertrude abandoned him when he was ten, Pryor was raised primarily by Marie,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.richardpryor.com/0/4113/0/1240D1271/ |title=Richard Pryor website |publisher=Richardpryor.com |accessdate=June 17, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100523025200/http://www.richardpryor.com/0/4113/0/1240D1271 |archivedate=May 23, 2010 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; a tall, violent woman who would beat him for any of his eccentricities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nndb.com/people/342/000022276/ |title=Richard Pryor |publisher=Nndb.com |accessdate=June 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pryor was one of four children raised in his grandmother's brothel. He was sexually abused at age seven,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|author=Jones, Steve|url= https://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2005-12-10-richard-pryor-obit_x.htm |title=Comedian Richard Pryor dies at 65|work=[[USA Today]]|date= December 10, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and expelled from school at the age of fourteen.&lt;ref name="New Yorker"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1999/09/13/a-pryor-love|title=A Pryor Love|author=[[Hilton Als|Als, Hilton]]|date=September 13, 1999|work=[[The New Yorker]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in Peoria, he became a [[Freemason]] at a local lodge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freemasonry.bcy.ca/biography/pryor_r/pryor_r.html |title=Richard Pryor|website= GLBCY|accessdate= October 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pryor served in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] from 1958 to 1960, but spent virtually the entire stint in an army prison. According to a 1999 profile about Pryor in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', Pryor was incarcerated for an incident that occurred while he was stationed in [[West Germany]]. Angered that a white soldier was overly amused at the racially charged scenes of [[Douglas Sirk]]'s film ''[[Imitation of Life (1959 film)|Imitation of Life]]'', Pryor and several other black soldiers beat and stabbed him, although not fatally.&lt;ref name="New Yorker"/&gt;

==Relationships and children==
Pryor was married seven times to five women:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="New Yorker" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
#Patricia Price, whom he married in 1960 and divorced the following year
#Shelley Bonus, whom he married in 1967 and divorced in 1969
#Deborah McGuire, whom he married on September 22, 1977; they divorced the following year.
#Jennifer Lee, whom he married in August 1981. They divorced in October 1982, but later remarried on June 29, 2001, and remained married until Pryor's death.
#Flynn Belaine, whom he married in October 1986. They were divorced in July 1987, but later remarried on April 1, 1990. They divorced again in July 1991.

Pryor also had relationships with actresses [[Pam Grier]] and [[Margot Kidder]].&lt;ref name=Rabin&gt;{{cite news|author=Rabin, Nathan Rabin| url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/random-roles-margot-kidder,24554/ |title=Random Roles: Margot Kidder (interview)|work=[[The A.V.

Pryor had seven children with six different women:

== Career ==
===1960s===
[[File:Richard Pryor 1969.JPG|thumb|Publicity photo of Pryor for one of his [[Mister Kelly's]] appearances, 1968–1969]]
In 1963, Pryor moved to New York City and began performing regularly in clubs alongside performers such as [[Bob Dylan]] and [[Woody Allen]]. On one of his first nights, he opened for singer and pianist [[Nina Simone]] at New York's [[Village Gate]]. Simone recalls Pryor's bout of [[performance anxiety]]:

{{quote|He shook like he had malaria, he was so nervous. I couldn't bear to watch him shiver, so I put my arms around him there in the dark and rocked him like a baby until he calmed down. The next night was the same, and the next, and I rocked him each time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=[[Nina Simone|Simone, Nina]] &amp; Cleary, Stephen |date=1991|title=[[I Put a Spell on You (book)|I Put a Spell on You: The Autobiography of Nina Simone]]|publisher=[[Pantheon Books]] |location=New York City|pages=70–71|isbn=978-0-679-41068-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Inspired by Bill Cosby, Pryor began as a [[middlebrow]] comic, with material far less controversial than what was to come. Soon, he began appearing regularly on television [[variety shows]], such as ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', ''[[The Merv Griffin Show]]'', and ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]''. His popularity led to success as a comic in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]]. The first five tracks on the 2005 compilation CD ''[[Evolution/Revolution: The Early Years (1966–1974)]]'', recorded in 1966 and 1967, capture Pryor in this period.

In September 1967, Pryor had what he described in his autobiography ''[[Pryor Convictions]]'' (1995) as an "[[Epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]]". He walked onto the stage at the [[Aladdin, Las Vegas|Aladdin Hotel]] in Las Vegas (with [[Dean Martin]] in the audience), looked at the sold-out crowd, exclaimed over the microphone, "What the fuck am I doing here!?", and walked off the stage. Afterward, Pryor began working profanity into his act, including the word "[[nigger]]". His first comedy recording, the eponymous 1968 debut release on the [[Reprise Records|Dove/Reprise]] label, captures this particular period, tracking the evolution of Pryor's routine. Around this time, his parents died—his mother in 1967 and his father in 1968.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;[http://www.bestcomedyonline.net/comedian-biographies/richard-pryor-personal-life "Richard Pryor-Personal Life"] Retrieved August 25, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, Pryor moved to [[Berkeley, California]], where he immersed himself in the [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] and rubbed elbows with the likes of [[Huey P. Newton]] and [[Ishmael Reed]].{{cn|date=February 2018}}

===1970s===
In the 1970s, Pryor wrote for such television shows as ''[[Sanford and Son]]'', ''[[The Flip Wilson Show]]'', and a 1973 [[Lily Tomlin]] special, for which he shared an [[Emmy Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/richard-pryor |title=Richard Pryor Emmy Winner |work=Television Academy}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, Pryor tried to break into mainstream television. He also appeared in several popular films, including ''[[Lady Sings the Blues (film)|Lady Sings the Blues]]'' (1972), ''[[The Mack]]'' (1973), ''[[Uptown Saturday Night]]'' (1974), ''[[Silver Streak (film)|Silver Streak]]'' (1976), ''[[Car Wash (film)|Car Wash]]'' (1976), ''[[Bingo Long Traveling All-Stars &amp; Motor Kings]]'' (1976), ''[[Which Way Is Up?]]'' (1977), ''[[Greased Lightning]]'' (1977), ''[[Blue Collar (film)|Blue Collar]]'' (1978), ''[[The Muppet Movie]]'' (1979).

Pryor signed with the comedy-oriented independent record label [[Laff Records]] in 1970, and in 1971 recorded his second album, ''Craps (After Hours)''. Two years later, the relatively unknown comedian appeared in the documentary ''[[Wattstax]]'' (1972), wherein he riffed on the tragic-comic absurdities of [[race relations]] in [[Watts, Los Angeles|Watts]] and the nation. Not long afterward, Pryor sought a deal with a larger label, and he signed with [[Stax Records]] in 1973.

When his third, breakthrough album, ''[[That Nigger's Crazy]]'' (1974), was released, Laff, which claimed ownership of Pryor's recording rights, almost succeeded in getting an injunction to prevent the album from being sold. Negotiations led to Pryor's release from his Laff contract. In return for this concession, Laff was enabled to release previously unissued material, recorded between 1968 and 1973, at will. ''That Nigger's Crazy'' was a commercial and critical success; it was eventually certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=UCQEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA5&amp;lpg=PA5&amp;dq=that+nigger's+crazy+RIAA+Gold&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PgkZ-6WDZs&amp;sig=wxKBEmpo3wnh2-UKdlKRTaWH4a0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiB7ITTuYHKAhXE1B4KHYXCDFsQ6AEIJzAF#v=onepage&amp;q=that%20nigger's%20crazy%20RIAA%20Gold&amp;f=false Paul Green, "Richie Sets Multiplantium Record: Boston Has RIAA Top Debut Album," ''Billboard'', November 15, 1986.]&lt;/ref&gt; and won the [[Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album]] at the [[Grammy Awards of 1975|1975 Grammy Awards]].

During the legal battle, Stax briefly closed its doors. At this time, Pryor returned to [[Reprise Records|Reprise]]/[[Warner Bros. Records]], which re-released ''That Nigger's Crazy'', immediately after ''[[...Is It Something I Said?]]'', his first album with his new label. Like ''That Nigger's Crazy'', the album was a hit with both critics and fans; it was eventually certified platinum by the RIAA and won the Grammy Award for Best Comedy Recording at the 1976 Grammy Awards.

Pryor's release ''[[Bicentennial Nigger]]'' (1976) continued his streak of success. It became his third consecutive gold album, and he collected his third consecutive Grammy for Best Comedy Recording for the album in 1977. With every successful album Pryor recorded for Warner (or later, his concert films and his 1980 [[Freebase (chemistry)|freebasing]] accident), Laff quickly published an album of older material to capitalize on Pryor's growing fame—a practice they continued until 1983. The covers of Laff albums tied in thematically with Pryor movies, such as ''Are You Serious?'' for ''[[Silver Streak (film)|Silver Streak]]'' (1976), ''The Wizard of Comedy'' for his appearance in ''[[The Wiz (film)|The Wiz]]'' (1978), and ''Insane'' for ''[[Stir Crazy (film)|Stir Crazy]]'' (1980).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://biography.yourdictionary.com/richard-pryor |title=Richard Pryor Fast Facts |last= |first= |date= |website=Yourdictionary |access-date=July 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Alan Alda Lily Tomlin Richard Pryor 1973.jpg|thumb|180px|Pryor also performed in the [[Lily Tomlin]] specials. He is seen here with Tomlin and [[Alan Alda]] in Tomlin's 1973 special.]]

Pryor co-wrote ''[[Blazing Saddles]]'' (1974), directed by [[Mel Brooks]] and starring [[Gene Wilder]]. Pryor was to play the lead role of Bart, but the film's production studio would not insure him, and Mel Brooks chose [[Cleavon Little]], instead. Before his horribly damaging 1980 freebasing incident, Pryor was about to start filming Mel Brooks' ''[[History of the World, Part I]]'' (1981), but was replaced at the last minute by [[Gregory Hines]].{{cn|date=February 2018}} Pryor was also originally considered for the role of Billy Ray Valentine on ''[[Trading Places]]'' (1983), before [[Eddie Murphy]] won the part.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

In 1975, Pryor was a guest host on the [[Saturday Night Live (season 1)|first season]] of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' and the first black person to host the show. Pryor took longtime girlfriend, actress-talk show host Kathrine McKee (sister of [[Lonette McKee]]), with him to New York, and she made a brief guest appearance with Pryor on ''SNL''. He participated in the "word association" skit with [[Chevy Chase]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://snltranscripts.jt.org/75/75ginterview.phtml |title=SNL Transcripts: Richard Pryor: 12/13/75: Racist Word Association Interview |publisher=Snltranscripts.jt.org |accessdate=June 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He would later do his own variety show,''[[The Richard Pryor Show]]'', which premiered on [[NBC]] in 1977. The show was cancelled after only four episodes probably because television audiences did not respond well to his show's controversial subject matter, and Pryor was unwilling to alter his material for network censors. During the short-lived series, [[Black president in popular culture (United States)|he portrayed the first black]] President of the United States, spoofed the ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' [[Mos Eisley Cantina|cantina]], took on gun violence, and in another skit, used costumes and visual distortion to appear nude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Silverman, David S. |date=2007|title=You Can't Air That: Four Cases of Controversy and Censorship in American Television Programming|location= Syracuse, NY|publisher=Syracuse University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, at the height of his success, Pryor visited Africa. Upon returning to the United States, Pryor swore he would never use the word "[[nigger]]" in his stand-up comedy routine again.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/15/opinion/the-nwordand-richard-pryor.html|title=The N-word and Richard Pryor|date=2005-12-15|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-12-20|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|JZCS5I80X-8|The word 'Nigger'&amp;nbsp;– Richard Pryor &amp; George Carlin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s===
[[File:Richard Pryor (1986) (cropped)-2.jpg|thumb|right|Pryor in February 1986]]
On the late evening of June 9, 1980, during the making of the film ''[[Stir Crazy (film)|Stir Crazy]]'', and after days of [[Free base|freebasing]] [[cocaine]], Pryor poured 151-proof [[rum]] all over himself and lit himself on fire. While ablaze, he ran down Parthenia Street from his [[Los Angeles]] home, until being subdued by police. He was taken to a hospital, where he was treated for second- and third-degree burns covering more than half of his body. Pryor spent six weeks in recovery at the Grossman Burn Center at [[Sherman Oaks Hospital]]. His daughter, [[Rain Pryor|Rain]], stated that the incident happened as a result of a bout of drug-induced [[psychosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Interview with Rain Pryor|date= November 6, 2006|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]| page =76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pryor incorporated a description of the incident into his comedy show ''[[Richard Pryor: Live on the Sunset Strip]]'' (1982). He joked that the event was caused by dunking a cookie into a glass of low-fat and [[pasteurization|pasteurized]] milk, causing an explosion. At the end of the bit, he poked fun at people who told jokes about it by waving a lit match and saying, "What's that? Richard Pryor running down the street."

After his "final performance", Pryor did not stay away from stand-up comedy long. Within a year, he filmed and released a new concert film and accompanying album, ''[[Richard Pryor: Here and Now]]'' (1983), which he directed himself. He also wrote and directed a fictionalized account of his life, ''[[Jo Jo Dancer, Your Life Is Calling]]'' (1986), which revolved around the 1980 freebasing incident.

In 1983, Pryor signed a five-year contract with [[Columbia Pictures]] for $40&amp;nbsp;million and he started his own production company, [[Indigo Productions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |agency=[[Associated Press]] |title=Richard Pryor Ouster of Blacks Criticized |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/17/movies/richard-pryor-ouster-of-blacks-criticized.html |quote=Mr. Pryor announced in May that he had signed a five-year, $40&amp;nbsp;million production deal with Columbia Pictures and promised to open up opportunities for minorities at his Indigo Productions. … |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date= December 17, 1983 |accessdate=2015-09-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCobit"&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Staff writer]] |date=December 10, 2005| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4517714.stm |title=Comedian Richard Pryor Dead at 65&amp;nbsp;– Groundbreaking Black U.S. Comedian Richard Pryor Has Died after Almost 20 Years with Multiple Sclerosis|work= [[BBC News]]|accessdate= January 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Softer, more formulaic films followed, including ''[[Superman III]]'' (1983), which earned Pryor $4&amp;nbsp;million; ''[[Brewster's Millions (1985 film)|Brewster's Millions]]'' (1985), ''[[Moving (1988 film)|Moving]]'' (1988), and ''[[See No Evil, Hear No Evil]]'' (1989). The only film project from this period that recalled his rough roots was Pryor's semiautobiographic debut as a writer-director, ''[[Jo Jo Dancer, Your Life Is Calling]]'' (1986), which was not a major success.

Despite a reputation for constantly using profanity on and off camera, Pryor briefly hosted a children's show on [[CBS]] called ''[[Pryor's Place]]'' (1984). Like ''[[Sesame Street]]'', ''Pryor's Place'' featured a cast of puppets, hanging out and having fun in a surprisingly friendly inner-city environment along with several children and characters portrayed by Pryor himself. However, ''Pryor's Place'' frequently dealt with more sobering issues than ''Sesame Street''. It was cancelled shortly after its debut, despite the efforts of famed puppeteers [[Sid and Marty Krofft]] and a theme song by [[Ray Parker, Jr.]] of "[[Ghostbusters (song)|Ghostbusters]]" (1984) fame.

Pryor co-hosted the [[Academy Awards]] twice and was nominated for an Emmy for a guest role on the television series ''[[Chicago Hope]]''. Network censors had warned Pryor about his profanity for the Academy Awards, and after a slip early in the program, a five-second delay was instituted when returning from a commercial break. Pryor is also one of only three ''Saturday Night Live'' hosts to be subjected to a rare five-second delay for his 1975 appearance (along with [[Sam Kinison]] in 1986 and [[Andrew Dice Clay]] in 1990).{{cn|date=February 2018}}

Pryor developed a reputation for being demanding and disrespectful on film sets, and for making selfish and difficult requests. In his autobiography ''Kiss Me Like a Stranger'', co-star Gene Wilder says that Pryor was frequently late to the set during filming of ''Stir Crazy'', and that he demanded, among other things, a helicopter to fly him to and from set because he was the star. Pryor was also accused of using allegations of on-set racism to force the hand of film producers into giving him more money:

&lt;blockquote&gt;One day during our lunch hour in the last week of filming, the [[craft service]] man handed out slices of watermelon to each of us. Richard, the whole camera crew, and I sat together in a big sound studio eating a number of watermelon slices, talking and joking. As a gag, some members of the crew used a piece of watermelon as a Frisbee, and tossed it back and forth to each other. One piece of watermelon landed at Richard's feet. He got up and went home. Filming stopped. The next day, Richard announced that he knew very well what the significance of watermelon was. He said that he was quitting show business and would not return to this film. The day after that, Richard walked in, all smiles. I wasn't privy to all the negotiations that went on between Columbia and Richard's lawyers, but the camera operator who had thrown that errant piece of watermelon had been fired that day. I assume now that Richard was using drugs during ''Stir Crazy''.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|date=March 1, 2005 |publisher=St. Martin's Press |title=Kiss Me Like a Stranger: My Search for Love and Art|isbn=978-0-312-33706-3|url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/993706.Kiss_Me_Like_A_Stranger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He appeared in ''[[Harlem Nights]]'' (1989), a comedy-drama crime film starring three generations of black comedians (Pryor, Eddie Murphy, and [[Redd Foxx]]).

===1990s and 2000s===
In his later years starting in the early to mid-1990s, Pryor used a power-operated [[mobility scooter]] due to multiple sclerosis (MS, which he said stood for "More Shit").{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} He appears on the scooter in his last film appearance, a small role in [[David Lynch]]'s ''[[Lost Highway (film)|Lost Highway]]'' (1997) playing an auto-repair garage manager named Arnie.

[[Rhino Records]] remastered all of Pryor's Reprise and WB albums for inclusion in the box set ''[[...And It's Deep Too! The Complete Warner Bros. Recordings (1968–1992)|...And It's Deep Too! The Complete Warner Bros. Recordings]]'' (2000).

In early 2000, Pryor appeared in the cold open of ''[[The Norm Show]]'' in the episode entitled "Norm vs. The Boxer". He played an elderly man in a wheelchair who lost the rights to in-home nursing when he kept attacking the nurses before attacking Norm himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Norm Show&amp;nbsp;– Norm vs. the Boxer |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0662160/ |publisher=Internet Movie Database |accessdate=August 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Pryor and his wife/manager, Jennifer Lee Pryor, won legal rights to all the Laff material, which amounted to almost 40 hours of reel-to-reel analog tape. After going through the tapes and getting Richard's blessing, Jennifer Lee Pryor gave Rhino Records access to the tapes in 2004. These tapes, including the entire ''Craps'' album, form the basis of the February 1, 2005, double-CD release ''[[Evolution/Revolution: The Early Years (1966–1974)]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=CD Universe|url=http://www.cduniverse.com/search/xx/music/pid/6817862/a/evolution%2Frevolution%3A+the+early+years+%281966-1974%29.htm|title=Richard Pryor – Evolution/Revolution: The Early Years (1966–1974) CD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health==
In November 1977, after many years of heavy smoking and drinking, Pryor suffered a mild heart attack. He recovered and resumed performing by January the following year. He was diagnosed with [[multiple sclerosis]] in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://richardpryor.com/biography.php |title=The Official Biography of Richard Pryor |publisher=Indigo, Inc. |accessdate=May 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, Pryor suffered a second heart attack while in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-03-23/news/mn-756_1_heart-attack|title=Richard Pryor Suffers a Minor Heart Attack in Australia|last=Writer|first=From a Times Staff|date=1990-03-23|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-06-20|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; He underwent triple [[heart bypass]] surgery in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1991-06-01/news/9106010694_1_richard-pryor-mcelwaine-cracking-jokes|title=Richard Pryor Cracking Jokes After Triple Bypass|work=tribunedigital-orlandosentinel|access-date=2017-06-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2004, his sister said he had lost his voice as result of his multiple sclerosis. However, on January 9, 2005, Pryor's wife, Jennifer Lee, rebutted this statement in a post on Pryor's official website, citing Richard as saying: "I'm sick of hearing this shit about me not talking... not true... I have good days, bad days... but I still am a talkin' motherfucker!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.richardpryor.com |title=Richard Pryor |publisher=Richard Pryor |accessdate=June 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===

On December 10, 2005, nine days after his 65th birthday, Pryor suffered a heart attack in Los Angeles. He was taken to a local hospital after his wife's attempts to resuscitate him failed. He was pronounced dead at 7:58&amp;nbsp;am [[Pacific Time Zone|PST]]. His widow Jennifer was quoted as saying, "At the end, there was a smile on his face."&lt;ref name="BBCobit" /&gt; He was [[cremation|cremated]], and his ashes were given to his family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=LWtqCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT486&amp;lpg=PT486&amp;dq=richard+pryor+cremated#v=onepage&amp;q=richard%20pryor%20cremated&amp;f=false|title=Where Are They Buried?: How Did They Die?

== Legacy ==
[[Jerry Seinfeld]] called Pryor "the [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]] of our profession"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Morton, Bruce |url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/12/21/morton.thosewelost/index.html |title=Those We Lost|work=[[CNN]]|accessdate=January 11, 2010|date=December 21, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bob Newhart]] heralded Pryor as "the seminal comedian of the last 50 years".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/database/newhart_b.html |work=PBS American Masters |title= Bob Newhart}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dave Chappelle]] said of Pryor, "You know those, like, evolution charts of man? He was the dude walking upright. Richard was the highest evolution of comedy."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite episode| title = Dave Chappelle| episodelink = Inside the Actors Studio| series = Inside the Actors Studio| serieslink = Inside the Actors Studio| network = [[Bravo (US TV channel)|Bravo]]| airdate = 2006-02-12| season = 12| number = 10}}&lt;/ref&gt; This legacy can be attributed, in part, to the unusual degree of intimacy Pryor brought to bear on his comedy. As [[Bill Cosby]] reportedly once said, "Richard Pryor drew the line between comedy and tragedy as thin as one could possibly paint it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=O'Benson |first=Tambay |title=Richard Pryor Retrospective at BAMcinématek, Brooklyn (10 Days, 20 Films, All in 35&amp;nbsp;mm) |url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/shadowandact/richard-pryor-retrospective-at-bamcinematek-brooklyn-10-days-20-films-all-in-35mm |work=Indiewire |accessdate=December 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Awards and honors===
In 1998, Pryor won the first [[Mark Twain Prize for American Humor]] from the [[John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts]]. According to former Kennedy Center President Lawrence J. Wilker, Pryor was selected as the first recipient of the Prize because 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
as a stand-up comic, writer, and actor, he struck a chord, and a nerve, with America, forcing it to look at large social questions of race and the more tragicomic aspects of the human condition. Though uncompromising in his wit, Pryor, like [[Mark Twain|Twain]], projects a generosity of spirit that unites us. They were both trenchant social critics who spoke the truth, however outrageous.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2004, Pryor was voted number one on [[Comedy Central]]'s list of the 100 Greatest Stand-ups of All Time.&lt;ref name=cc/&gt; In a 2005 British poll to find "The Comedian's Comedian", Pryor was voted the 10th-greatest comedy act ever by fellow comedians and comedy insiders.

Pryor was posthumously awarded the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Richard Pryor to Get Posthumous Grammy Award |date=January 11, 2006 |work=Voice of America |url=http://voanews.com/english/archive/2006-01/Richard-Pryor-to-Get-Posthumous-Grammy-Award.cfm |accessdate=January 4, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913185314/http://voanews.com/english/archive/2006-01/Richard-Pryor-to-Get-Posthumous-Grammy-Award.cfm |archivedate=September 13, 2008 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The animal rights organization [[PETA]] gives out an award in Pryor's name to people who have done outstanding work to alleviate animal suffering. Pryor was active in animal rights and was deeply concerned about the plight of elephants in circuses and zoos.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Artist Preston Jackson created a life-sized bronze statue in dedication to the beloved comedian and named it "Richard Pryor: More than Just a Comedian". It was placed at the corner of State and Washington Streets in downtown Peoria, on May 1, 2015, close to the neighborhood in which he grew up with his mother. The unveiling was held Sunday, May 3, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news |date=May 1, 2015 |title=Long effort to honor Peoria-born comedian Richard Pryor culminates in Sunday unveiling |author=Leslie Renken|work= Peoria Journal Star |url=http://m.pjstar.com/article/20150429/NEWS/150428947 |accessdate=May 1, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A television documentary, ''[[Richard Pryor: I Ain't Dead Yet|Richard Pryor: I Ain't Dead Yet, #*%$#@]]!!'' (2003) consisted of archival footage of Pryor's performances and testimonials from fellow comedians, including [[Dave Chappelle]], [[Denis Leary]], [[Chris Rock]], and [[Wanda Sykes]], on Pryor's influence on comedy.

On December 19, 2005, [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]] aired a Pryor special, titled ''[[The Funniest Man Dead or Alive]]''.
