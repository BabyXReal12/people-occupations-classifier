'''Julie Doucet''' (born December 31, 1965)&lt;ref name=autobio&gt;[http://www.juliedoucet.net/html/bio.html Julie Doucet's biography at her website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090805162952/http://www.juliedoucet.net/html/bio.html |date=2009-08-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[underground comix|underground]] [[cartoonist]] and artist, best known for her autobiographical works such as ''[[Dirty Plotte]]'' and ''My New York Diary''. Her work is concerned with such topics as "[[sexual intercourse|sex]], [[violence]], [[menstruation]] and [[gender|male/female issues]]."&lt;ref name=onset /&gt;

==Biography==

===Early career===

Doucet was born in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]].  She was educated first at an all-girls Catholic school, then studied fine arts at [[Cégep du Vieux Montréal]] (a junior college) and afterwards at the [[Université du Québec à Montréal]].&lt;ref name=autobio /&gt; Her university degree was in [[printmaking|printing arts]].&lt;ref name=autobio /&gt;  She began cartooning in 1987. She was published in small-press comics and self-published her own comic called ''[[Dirty Plotte]]''.  She used the photocopied [[zine]] to record "her day to day life, her dreams, angsts, [and] fantasies."&lt;ref name=autobio /&gt;  It was only when she was published in ''[[Weirdo (magazine)|Weirdo]]'',&lt;ref name=weirdo26&gt;[http://www.comics.org/details.lasso?id=46772 Weirdo #26 at the GCD]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Crumb]]'s magazine, that she began to attract critical attention.&lt;ref name=onset&gt;[[Mark Shainblum|Shainblum, Mark]]: "Canada's Alternative Comic Creators Stand Up For Themselves", ''Onset'', volume 1 issue 4 (page25)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comic works===

Doucet began being published by [[Drawn &amp; Quarterly]] in January 1991 in a regular sized comic series also named ''Dirty Plotte''.&lt;ref name=plottegcd&gt;[http://www.comics.org/series.lasso?SeriesID=13917 ''Dirty Plotte'' (Drawn &amp; Quarterly) at the GCD]&lt;/ref&gt;  Shortly thereafter, she moved to [[New York City|New York]]. Although she moved to [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]] the following year, her experiences in New York formed the basis of the critically acclaimed ''My New York Diary'' (many stories of which were taken from ''Dirty Plotte''). She moved from Seattle to [[Berlin]] in 1995, before finally returning to Montreal in 1998.&lt;ref name=autobio /&gt;  While in Berlin, she had a book named ''Ciboire de criss'' published by [[L'Association]] in Paris, her first book in French.&lt;ref name=autobio /&gt; Once back in Montreal, she released the twelfth and final issue of ''Dirty Plotte'' before beginning a brief hiatus from comics.

She returned to the field in 2000 with ''The Madame Paul Affair'', a slice-of-life look at contemporary Montreal which was originally serialized in ''[[ici (magazine)|Ici-Montreal]]'', a local alternative weekly. At the same time, she was branching out into more experimental territory, culminating with the 2001 release of ''Long Time Relationship'', a collection of prints and engravings. In 2004, Doucet also published in French an illustrated diary (''Journal'') chronicling about a year of her life and, in 2006, an [[autobiography]] made from a [[collage]] of words cut from magazines and newspapers (''J comme Je'').  Also in spring of 2006 she had her first solo print show, named ''en souvenir du Melek'', at the galerie B-312 in Montreal.&lt;ref name=b312&gt;[http://www.galerieb-312.qc.ca/html/expo_jdoucet.html Art show introduction at galerie B-312 by Jean-Emile Verdier] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706200516/http://www.galerieb-312.qc.ca/html/expo_jdoucet.html |date=2011-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2007, Drawn &amp; Quarterly published ''365 Days: A Diary by Julie Doucet'', in which she chronicled her life for a year, starting in late 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |publisher=Pop Matters |url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/365-days-a-diary-by-julie-doucet/ |title=365 Days: A Diary by Julie Doucet |first=Brian |last=Bethel |date=25 March 2008 |accessdate=30 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-comic works===

She remains a fixture in the Montreal arts community, but in an interview in the June 22, 2006, edition of the ''[[Montreal Mirror]]'', she declared that she had retired from long-form comics.&lt;ref name=mirror&gt;[http://www.montrealmirror.com/2006/062206/cover_art.html Interview in the Montreal Mirror, June 22, 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080810223933/http://www.montrealmirror.com/2006/062206/cover_art.html |date=August 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She also said "...it's quite a lot of work, and not that much money. I went to a newspaper to propose a comic strip because I only had to draw a small page and it would be out the next week. For once it was regular pay and good money."&lt;ref name=mirror /&gt;

{{cquote|I quit comics because I got completely sick of it. I was drawing comics all the time and didn't have the time or energy to do anything else. That got to me in the end. I never made enough money from comics to be able to take a break and do something else. Now I just can't stand comics.&lt;ref name=drama&gt;"A Good Life: The Julie Doucet Interview" by Dan Nadel, published in ''[[The Drama]]'', issue no. 7 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{cquote|. . . I wish my work would be recognized by a larger crowd of people as more art than be stuck with the cartoonist label for the rest of my life. That's what's killing me about a lot of those comics guys. [[Dan Clowes]] is mostly a writer, a great artist, and has tried different things, But a lot of those guys, their drawing style never changes—the content neither—and it seems it never will. I just don't understand that, how you can spend fifty years of your artist life doing the same thing over and over again.&lt;ref name=drama /&gt;}}

She had a book of poetry published by [[L’Oie de Cravan]] in 2006, ''À l’école de l’amour''.&lt;ref name=walrus&gt;[http://www.walrusmagazine.com/articles/2008.02-online-exclusive-julie-doucet-interview Interview with Doucet at ''The Walrus'' magazine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513053835/http://www.walrusmagazine.com/articles/2008.02-online-exclusive-julie-doucet-interview/ |date=2008-05-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her current artwork consists of linocuts, collage and papier-mache sculptures.&lt;ref name=dandqbio&gt;[http://www.drawnandquarterly.com/artBio.php?artist=a3dff7dd52e65a Biography at Drawn and Quarterly]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Doucet designed the cover for the [[Penguin Classics]] Deluxe Edition of [[Louisa May Alcott]]'s ''[[Little Women]]''.&lt;ref name=penguin&gt;[http://us.penguingroup.com/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9780143105015,00.html?strSrchSql=doucet/Little_Women_Louisa_May_Alcott# Little Women at Penguin]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and honours==

In 1991, ''Dirty Plotte'' was nominated for best new series and Doucet won the [[Harvey Awards|Harvey Award]] for "[[List of Harvey Award winners#Best New Talent|Best New Talent]]".&lt;ref name=harvey&gt;[http://www.harveyawards.org/awards_1991win.html Harvey Award Winners 1991] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101109200822/http://www.harveyawards.org/awards_1991win.html |date=2010-11-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=awardslist&gt;[http://www.hahnlibrary.net/comics/awards/harvey91.php 1991 Harvey Awards list at Comic Book Awards Almanac]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1999, when ''[[The Comics Journal]]'' made a list of the top 100 comics of all time, she was on several of the short-lists and ''Dirty Plotte'' ranked 96th.&lt;ref name=comicsjournal100&gt;[http://tcj.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=74&amp;Itemid=70 Short-lists for Comics Journal 100]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, her book ''My New York Diary'' won the Firecracker award for best graphic novel.&lt;ref name=firecracker&gt;[http://www.readersread.com/awards/firecracker.htm Firecracker Award winners]&lt;/ref&gt;  Doucet's book ''365 Days: A Diary'' was nominated for best book award at the 2009 [[Doug Wright Awards]].&lt;ref name=wright&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/arts/books/story/2008/06/03/cartooning-awards.html CBC on the 2008 Doug Wright Awards]&lt;/ref&gt;
