'''John Lewis Hart''' (February 18, 1931&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; April 7, 2007) was an [[United States|American]] [[cartoonist]] noted as the creator of the [[comic strips]] ''[[B.C. (comic)|B.C.]]'' and ''[[Wizard of Id]]''. [[Brant Parker]] co-produced and illustrated ''[[Wizard of Id]]''. Hart was recognized with several awards, including the Swedish [[Adamson Award]] and five from the [[National Cartoonists Society]]. In his later years, he sparked controversy by incorporating overtly [[Christianity|Christian]] themes and messages into the strips.&lt;ref name="postGazette"&gt;{{cite news|last= Bernstein|first= Adam |title= Obituary: Johnny Hart|publisher = The Washington Post |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/07099/776387-122.stm | date=April 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hart was referred to as "the most widely read Christian of our time," over [[C. S. Lewis]], [[Frank Peretti]], and [[Billy Graham]], by [[Chuck Colson]] in a ''Breakpoint'' column.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christiancomicsinternational.org/quote_americas.html "Comics Quotes &amp; Facts from The Americas (South &amp; North)" citing "BreakPoint with Chuck Colson," July 1999]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Born in [[Endicott, New York]], Hart's first published work was in ''[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]'' while he served in [[Korean War|Korea]] as an enlisted member of the [[United States Air Force]]. Returning in 1953, he published cartoons in ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'', ''[[Collier's Weekly]]'' and other magazines. His pre-cartooning employment included working in a barbecue restaurant and sign painting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cartoonician.com/the-johnny-hart-interview/ ''The Johnny Hart Interview'', 1995]&lt;/ref&gt; Hart's biggest success, ''B.C.'', was created in 1957 and began appearing in national daily [[newspaper]]s on February 17, 1958.&lt;ref name="Lambiek"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lambiek Comiclopedia|title=Johnny Hart|url=http://www.lambiek.net/artists/h/hart.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hart also co-created and wrote the comic strip ''The Wizard of Id'', drawn by [[Brant Parker]], which has been distributed since November 9, 1964.&lt;ref name="Lambiek"/&gt;

{{wikinews|Johnny Hart of "B.C." fame passes away}}Hart died of a stroke on April 7, 2007. According to his wife, he was working at his drawing table at the time of his death.&lt;ref name="Hart death report"&gt;{{cite news|title = Johnny Hart Dies at 76|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/09/nyregion/09HartObit.html

===Religious convictions===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:BC Hart turtle.gif|thumb|260px|A late-era ''B.C.'' strip by Johnny Hart]] --&gt;
Hart was raised in a casually religious family, and he attended [[Christianity|Christian]] Sunday School regularly. Although his formal education ended with high school, he was fascinated by the [[Bible]] from a young age.&lt;ref name="PTM"&gt;{{cite web
 |title=At the Hart of B.C. 
 |url=http://www.ptm.org/JulHartofBC.htm 
 |publisher=Plain Truth Ministries 
 |deadurl=yes

 |archivedate=2004-06-19 
 |df= 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1984 there was a distinguishable shift in Hart's spirituality, and Hart and wife Bobby began attending a congregation of the [[Presbyterian Church (USA)|Presbyterian Church]] in [[Nineveh, New York]]. Hart attributed his religious awakening to a father-son team of contractors who installed a satellite dish at his home.&lt;ref name="PTM"/&gt; 
Hart's increasingly deep religious faith, and the staunch theological and political [[conservatism]] that accompanied it, came to be the source of considerable controversy in the later years of his life. In a 1999 interview with ''[[The Washington Post]]'', for example, he stated that "[[Jew]]s and [[Muslim]]s who don't accept Jesus will burn in Hell" and that "[[homosexuality]] is the handiwork of [[Satan]]."&lt;ref name="LATimes-obit"&gt;{{cite news

The lion's share of controversy, however, came from Hart's increasing tendency to incorporate his religious and political themes and ideals into his comic strips, especially ''B.C.'' Some newspapers refused to print strips with overtly religious themes or, as with the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', moved them to the religious section of the newspaper.&lt;ref name="CC"&gt;{{cite news

===Controversial strips===
Two strips in particular were controversial. The ''B.C.'' strip for April 15, 2001, which was [[Easter]], portrayed a Jewish [[Menorah (Temple)|menorah]] with seven candles progressively burning out as the strip captions ran the words of [[Jesus Christ]]. At the end, the outer arms of the candelabra broke away, leaving a [[Christian cross]], with the final panel portraying the opened and [[Death and resurrection of Jesus|empty tomb of Christ]].&lt;ref name="WashingtonPost2003"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/456685601.html?FMT=ABS&amp;date=Nov+21%2C+2003 |title=Cartoon Raises a Stink: Some See Slur Against Islam in a 'B.C.' Outhouse Strip |author=Gene Weingarten |publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|date=November 21, 2003|accessdate=2007-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics including the [[Anti-Defamation League]] and the [[American Jewish Committee]] argued that Hart's strip portrayed [[replacement theology]], that is, the conception of Christianity as supplanting [[Judaism]]. Hart offered an apology "if I have offended any readers," but still thought the strip could increase "religious awareness" and claimed that he had meant the strip to be a tribute to both religions.&lt;ref name="CC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="USAToday"&gt;{{cite news|title='B.C.' cartoonist Johnny Hart dies at 76|last=USA Today|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2007-04-08-johnny-hart-obit_N.htm | date=April 9, 2007 | accessdate=May 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite news|title='B.C.' cartoonist Johnny Hart dies |last=CNN.com |url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/04/08/obit.hart.ap/index.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070412184336/http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/04/08/obit.hart.ap/index.html |archivedate=April 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another ''B.C.'' strip, which ran November 10, 2003, showed an outhouse with a traditional [[crescent]], which a character entered with a vertical graphic "SLAM", only to ask, "Is it just me, or does it stink in here?" Critics including the [[Council on American-Islamic Relations]] claimed that the combination of the vertical bar and the "SLAM", as well as the crescent moons both in the sky and on the outhouse, made the strip a slur on [[Islam]]. Hart denied that it was anything but an outhouse joke.&lt;ref name="WashingtonPost2003"/&gt;

==Personal life==
Hart was an active member of his local community&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; the area of [[Greater Binghamton]] in [[Broome County, New York]], which shares a common abbreviation of "B.C." Hart donated B.C.-based drawings and logos free of charge to  many entities and organizations found in the Broome County area, including logos for:
* [[B.C. Transit]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; Caveman on Wheel
* [http://www.gobroomecounty.com/parks Broome County Parks]&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; Dinosaur
* [http://www.gobroomecounty.com/senior/mow Broome County Meals on Wheels]&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; Caveman on Wheel with Food

* [http://www.stic-cil.org/ Southern Tier Independence Center]&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; Caveman in stone wheelchair stuck in cave doorway, "Wiley" character navigating a landscape full of holes
 
Hart's involvement with the B.C. Open dated back to the early 1970s, and characters from ''B.C.'' were used extensively in advertising and marketing materials for the event, including the winner's trophy which was a bronzed version of a hapless ''B.C.'' Caveman golfing, a light-hearted trophy when compared to many others, leading it to have earned the designation of being "voted by the players on Tour as the best trophy on Tour; the one that they would love to have."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Additionally, Hart contributed original panels of ''B.C.'' strips for charity auctions with the [[Binghamton, New York]]-based PBS affiliate, [[WSKG-TV]]. He also provided album cover art for the 1999 album ''Still Fresh'' by the world-famous jazz vocal group [[The Four Freshmen]], and his strips for B.C. were the inspiration for the mascot of [[University of California at Irvine|UC Irvine]], the anteater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Tribute==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:MGG051407.gif|thumb|300px|A May 14, 2007 ''[[Mother Goose &amp; Grimm]]'' cartoon paying tribute to Hart.]] --&gt;
Hart was memorialized in a May 14, 2007, strip of the comic strip ''[[Mother Goose &amp; Grimm]]''. In the June 20, 2007, ''Blondie'' strip, the last panel shows Mr. Dithers saying, "Boy oh boy, that Johnny Hart sure knew his stuff, didn't he?"  [[Bruce Tinsley]] honored Hart in his ''[[Mallard Fillmore]]'' strip of July 10, 2007.
[[Image:Mallard fillmore BC tribute.jpg|thumb|300px|A July 10, 2007 ''[[Mallard Fillmore]]'' tribute.]]

There was also a tribute in ''[[The Wizard of Id]]'' strip. In the February 14, 2008, strip, two peasant women are talking. One who has just bought some flowers says: "How come you don't celebrate Valentine's Day?" and the other answers: "My Hart isn't in it this year."

==Awards==
With the release of ''Wizard of Id'' in 1964, Hart became one of only four cartoonists to have two comic strips appearing in over 1000 papers each. He won numerous awards for his work, including the [[National Cartoonists Society]]'s Reuben award for ''B.C.'' in 1968 and ''Wizard of Id'' in 1984.
