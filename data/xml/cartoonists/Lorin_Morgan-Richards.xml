'''Lorin Morgan-Richards''' (born 16 February 1975) is an American author and illustrator,&lt;ref name="americymru1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americymru.net/profiles/blogs/an-interview-with-lorin |title=An Interview with Lorin Morgan-Richards |publisher=AmeriCymru |date=2010-08-25 |accessdate=2014-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; primarily of [[children's literature]]. He was also the publisher of [[Celtic Family Magazine]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walesartsreview.org/the-welsh-in-america/ |title=The Welsh in America |publisher=Wales Art Review |date=2013-02-27 |accessdate=2014-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and founder of the [[Los Angeles St. David's Day Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.welshicons.org.uk/news/welsh-singing-sensation-meinir-gwilym-makes-her-american-debut-in-hollywood/ |title=Welsh Singing Sensation Meinir Gwilym Makes her American Debut in Hollywood |publisher=Welsh Icon News |date=2014-01-12 |accessdate=2014-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/showbiz/381087/Richard-Burton-honorured-with-a-star-on-Hollywood-Walk-of-Fame |title=Richard Burton honored with a star on Hollywood Walk of Fame |publisher=Express |date=2013-03-01 |accessdate=2014-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailypost.co.uk/news/north-wales-news/st-davids-day-wales-around-6758228/ |title=St David's Day: Wales Around the World |publisher=Daily Post |date=2014-02-28 |accessdate=2014-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carmarthenjournal.co.uk/Carmarthenshire-Hollywood/story-20445486-detail/story.html |title=From Carmarthenshire to Hollywood |publisher=Carmarthen Journal |date=2014-01-15 |accessdate=2014-08-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140319001217/http://www.carmarthenjournal.co.uk/Carmarthenshire-Hollywood/story-20445486-detail/story.html |archivedate=19 March 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is known for founding the Los Angeles St. David's Day Festival, one of the largest Welsh festivals of its kind in the United States, and founding the most widely distributed print publication based in the United States about Celtic cultures and interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://isleofman.isle-news.com/archives/acclaimed-local-portrait-artist-features-in-us-magazine/25302/ |title=Acclaimed local portrait artist features in US magazine |publisher=Isle News |date=2014-02-20 |accessdate=2014-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 he won the Eisteddfod Honorary Recognition for Bardic Achievements.

Morgan-Richards was born in [[Beebetown, Ohio]] and is of [[Welsh people|Welsh]], [[Swiss]] ([[Amish]]) and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] descent.&lt;ref name="issuu1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://issuu.com/jamesmichaelmcdonough/docs/irish_a_e_for_digital |title=Celts in California |publisher=Irish Arts &amp; Entertainment |date=2014-07-01 |accessdate=2014-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Richards was raised in an old converted school house in [[Beebetown, Ohio]]. His mother (a student of fine art) taught him the basics of drawing and music composition on the family pump organ. Richards also credited his imagination on the plentiful books his family owned, creative isolation, and the sheer number of animals they took care of, many of which he incorporated into his early drawings and writings.&lt;ref name="issuu1"/&gt;

Richards interest in [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] and [[American frontier|American Western]] history began in childhood. “I remember my first book as a child was ''The Indians Knew'' by [[Tillie S. Pine]], an early reader from 1965 explaining the cultural ways and historical resourcefulness of Native Americans and how they are applied in the sciences today.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.british-weekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/lrbw032616.pdf |title=Welsh in the Old West: More than you thought |publisher=British Weekly |date=2016-03-26 |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Richards entered second grade, he was diagnosed with a form of [[dyslexia]] that required tutoring through the ninth grade. By his early teens, he was reading and became inspired by [[Edward Lear]], [[L. Frank Baum]], [[Roald Dahl]], and [[Lewis Carroll]]; helping him overcome his reading disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://steamkat.com/feature-dark-letter-days-by-lorin-morgan-richards/ |title=Interview with Lorin Morgan-Richards |publisher=SteamKat.com |date=2016-04-09 |accessdate=2016-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richards Great Uncle was [[Elliott D. Canonge]] who worked with the [[Comanche]] and [[Inuit]]. On his mother’s side, Richards ancestor was the 19th-century Welsh-American poet Robert Dennison Morgan.&lt;ref&gt;''Poems of Life'', by Robert Dennison Morgan, Columbus, OH: New Franklin Printing Co. VG. 1914&lt;/ref&gt; Robert's father (Richards direct ancestor) John Morgan left the [[Tredegar]] area of Wales and emigrated to southern Ohio in the early part of the 1800s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Descendants_of_John_Morgan_and_Mary.html?id=nBWOMQEACAAJ&amp;hl=en |title=The Descendants of John Morgan and Mary Shaw - Lorin Morgan-Richards, Karen M. Richards - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date=2016-12-06 |accessdate=2017-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theater==
[[File:Still photo from NYC Premiere of 'An Occurrence Remembered' directed by Lorin Morgan-Richards, 2001.jpg|thumb|Still photo from NYC Premiere of ''An Occurrence Remembered'' directed by Lorin Morgan-Richards, 2001]]Between 1993-2003, Richards received an [[Associate degree|AA Degree]] in [[Liberal Arts]] at [[Cuyahoga Community College]] and credited their [[Anthropology]] Professor Mark Lewine as a mentor. During this time, Richards also achieved minor success in producing music projects containing modern dance and theater, and befriended and collaborated with artist [[Textbeak]]. "I first attended Tri-C Western campus where my focus was on Liberal Arts. At the time, I kept a journal of random thoughts, doodles, and lyrics and used the filter of music as my art. So, the bulk of my classes were in this field of study. I made connections with other artists who shared similar passions, and we were all eager to form various projects of expression. I moved to [[Lakewood, Ohio|Lakewood]] to be closer to the performance spaces and switched to Tri-C Metro where I was awakened out of my shell by an Anthropology teacher named Dr. Mark Lewine.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cacho |first=Daniela |url=http://www.cccvoice.com/2018/02/26/one-of-many-tri-c-alumni-contains-a-creator-of-childrens-literature/ |title=One of many Tri-C Alumni Contains a Creator of Children’s Literature – The Voice |publisher=Cccvoice.com |date=2015-02-13 |accessdate=2018-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, Richards solo album ''ENKI'' and subsequent live production were based on [[Zecharia Sitchin]]'s book ''[[The Twelfth Planet]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Scene Magazine, 2000 Scene Magazine Music Awards, Erick Trickey, published April 27, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Last Sigh Magazine, Enki, by Tek, published May 28, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Cleveland Free Times, The Power of ENKI, by Laura DeMarco, Published November 17–23, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; The show premiered in [[Cleveland, Ohio]] under the choreography of Michael Medcalf. Native American musical act Shouting Mountain opened the evening. In 2001, Richards followed the success of ''ENKI'' with the production of ''An Occurrence Remembered'', influenced by the metaphysical war writings of [[Ambrose Bierce]]. The performance premiered in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;Civil War Times Illustrated, December 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ambrosebierce.org/journal4zaffino.html Ambrose Bierce Journal]&lt;/ref&gt; Richards reflects on the performance: "Rehearsals were underway when 9-11 happened and I recall we continued only for our own therapy of the situation, knowing theater-goers were not going out. It was a tremendous performance, but it financially broke me."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Golwg360, January 21, 2016, Welsh language newspaper.&lt;/ref&gt;

Richards calls his synth music "Dark Electronic Storytelling" as it is conceptually based on written works and is meant for dramatic performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.darktwincities.com/reviews.php?review=60 |title=Reviews |publisher=Darktwincities.Com |date=2008-10-04 |accessdate=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Richards announced on social media in June of 2018 that he was re-releasing previous albums and upcoming tracks under the new moniker ''Elder Moon''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/LMorganRichards/status/1007344454926135296/?taken-by=LMorganRichards_&amp;hl=en|title=Lorin Morgan-Richards - Elder Moon • Jun 14, 2018 at 12:30pm UTC|website=Twitter|language=en|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing career==
In 2002, Richards moved to [[Los Angeles]] to start over where he refocused his artistic direction into writing and illustrating, which he said: "did not need the expenses of my past but only a pen and paper."&lt;ref&gt;Gothic Beauty Magazine, Issue 31, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; While his novel ''[[Me’ma and the Great Mountain]]'' (2012) began drafts as early as 2002, it was ''[[Simon Snootle and Other Small Stories]]'' that became his first book release in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/simon-snootle-and-other-small-stories-book Dread Central]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Disdeinen.net, October 13, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year Richards delivered four new releases including his second book of short stories in ''[[A Boy Born from Mold and Other Delectable Morsels]]''.

Richards conceptualized most of ''[[The Goodbye Family]]'' characters in 2009 during a trip to the UK and France with his wife, although they were mentioned before this in his western novel ''Me’ma and the Great Mountain''. Richards explains "I took a diary on the trip in order to write my second novel ''The Goodbye Family''.[[File:Orphie Goodbye Family Lorin Morgan-Richards.jpg|thumb|Orphie from ''The Goodbye Family'' by Lorin Morgan-Richards]]  
       
The Goodbye family consisted of undertakers Otis and Pyridine, their daughter Orphie and her pet tarantula Dorian. Orphie was first seen atop the [[Notre Dame Cathedral]] with gargoyles, Otis was trying to board a train at customs with a shrunken head, Pyridine was sewing a limb back together in [[Cardiff]], and Dorian was capturing a fairy to eat. Following these illustrations, a cat Ouiji was unveiled and Orphie is said to have a brother named Kepla, but he is hardly ever seen and it is unclear if he even exists."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://steamkat.com/goodbyeanniversary-2/ |title=An Interview with Lorin Morgan-Richards |publisher=SteamKat! |date=2016-11-28 |accessdate=2017-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Between 2009 and 2013, Richards was bookbinding his limited edition versions of each title with runs equaling 50 to 400. These collectible books were typically [[Oversewn binding|oversewn]] by hand with a faux leather hard backing and linen pages inside. In an interview he states:

"Having seen what is being printed by majors these days with poor quality paper, I wanted to provide the reader with a book that carries more value near the same price and that can last for generations. Nothing would be more inspiring to me than to know my books are treasured like an heirloom."

Stylistically, Richards prefers a pencil and ink approach to his illustrations, and his writing often has elements of dark satire.&lt;ref name="americymru1"/&gt;

In 2015 Richards began two weekly cartoons on Steamkat, a comic strip site, ''The Goodbye Family'' and ''The Noodle Rut''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://steamkat.com/ |title=Home |publisher=SteamKat! |date= |accessdate=2017-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richards won the 2016 Official Tasty Nugget award for his illustrated story ''Sad Lost Doll''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tastynuggets.com/morgan-richards |title=Tasty Nuggets Banjo's Hollywood |publisher=Tasty Nuggets |date=2016-11-01 |accessdate=2016-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Marcil d'Hirson Garron.jpg|thumb|''Homeless child studies under the moonlight'' by Marcil d'Hirson Garron]]

===Marcil d’Hirson Garron===
In February 2018, artwork started daily on social media under the name Marcil d’Hirson Garron, with the artist coining their style as [[Imperfectualism]] (art that cannot be easily replicated by machine). Likewise, Garron adopted the label [[Imperfectualism|Imperfectualist]] (an artist that looks to slow automation through their art). The artwork is free of precision and appears as minimalistic inked line drawings, however detail is seen  hidden between the lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/LMorganRichards/status/979004878239408128/?taken-by=LMorganRichards_&amp;hl=en|title=Instagram post by Lorin Morgan-Richards - Homeless child studies under the moonlight By Marcil d'Hirson Garron • Mar 28, 2018 at 7:38am UTC|website=Instagram|language=en|access-date=2018-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Links point to an association between Richards and Garron. Garron was first mentioned in Richards series ''[[The Goodbye Family]]'' as  Orphie’s favorite artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BgjHPp8nUAT/?taken-by=marcildgarron_&amp;hl=en|title=Instagram post by Marcil d’Hirson Garron • Mar 20, 2018 at 4:02am UTC|website=Instagram|language=en|access-date=2018-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, Marcil d’Hirson Garron is an [[anagram]] of Lorin Morgan-Richards.

==A Raven Above Press==
A Raven Above Press was founded in 2009 by Richards with a focus on printing his illustrated stories and promoting other authors and illustrators of Celtic and Native American origin. The press also became a catalyst for producing cultural events and art exhibits. Notably, the [[Los Angeles St. David's Day Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walesworldwide.org/2014/02/welsh-artists-to-descend-on-hollywood-this-coming-st-davids-day/ |title=Welsh artists to descend on Hollywood this coming St David’s Day |publisher=Wales World Wide |date=2014-02-10 |accessdate=2014-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 1, 2013, [[Celtic Family Magazine]] hit the newsstands with a release party in Cardiff, Wales.&lt;ref name="issuu1"/&gt; Richards was the founder and publisher of Celtic Family Magazine from its inception in 2013 to its hiatus in 2017.

The logo for A Raven Above Press displays a [[raven]] atop a bending [[Cupressus sempervirens|cypress tree]]. Model [[Wednesday Mourning]] has appeared in the main ad for A Raven Above Press,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aravenabovepress.org/products/a-raven-above-press-t-shirt ]{{dead link|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Morgan-Richards daughter Berlin in her traditional Welsh dress.

Richards would produce a book for every Welsh event he curated through A Raven Above Press. Outside of including his own illustration, these books often had American and Welsh artists depict the subject matter. Notable artists involved were Jen Delyth, [[Ruth Jên]], [[Siobhan Owen]], [[Monica Richards]], [[Nichola and Sarah Hope]], and [[Nathan Wyburn]] to name a few. The following is a list of these books: 
* &lt;small&gt;''A Welsh Alphabet'' by Lorin Morgan-Richards and Peter Anthony Freeman (2010) in conjunction with the 2011 West Coast Eisteddfod.&lt;/small&gt;
* &lt;small&gt;''The Children’s Voice: A Definitive Collection of Welsh Nursery Rhymes'' by Peter Anthony Freeman (2012) in conjunction with the 2012 Los Angeles St. David’s Day Festival.&lt;/small&gt;
* &lt;small&gt;''The Age of Saints'' by Peter Anthony Freeman (2013) in conjunction with the 2013 Los Angeles St. David’s Day Festival.&lt;/small&gt;
* &lt;small&gt;''Welsh in the Old West'' by Lorin Morgan-Richards (2015) created for but released after the 2014 Los Angeles St. David’s Day Festival.&lt;/small&gt;

===Native American Involvement===
[[File:Lorin Morgan-Richards speaking at Bringing the Circle Together.jpg|thumb|Lorin Morgan-Richards speaking at Bringing the Circle Together]] Richards speaking on the history books he read in grade school: "Usually the pictures told much more about American history than the text. I remembered seeing at a very early age a glowing photo of Custer and a few pages after (of) an elderly man, who looked like my own grandfather, lying dead in the snow. He was alone, and without care. I later found out his name was Miniconjou chief [[Spotted Elk]] (Bigfoot) and he was part of the [[massacre at Wounded Knee]]. That photo has always stuck with me. I knew something was not right, and the text which was alongside it was not giving the full story."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

Richards received a [[Bachelor Degree|BA Degree]] in Anthropology at [[California State University, Los Angeles]], where he focused on cultural studies (specifically [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas]]). To help pay for school, Richards worked at an art gallery in [[Westwood, California|Westwood]] and later at the [[Southwest Museum of the American Indian]] store where he assisted setting up gallery shows including works by [[Russell Means]].  On February 11, 2008, Richards met [[Dennis Banks]] and was in support of [[American Indian Movement|The Longest Walk 2]] starting on Alcatraz Island.  Around this time, Richards attended a conference in [[Cleveland, Ohio]] on [[Native American mascot controversy|Native mascots]] hosted by brothers [[Vernon Bellecourt]] and [[Clyde Bellecourt]], and also credits hearing [[John Trudell]] speak at his university as influential to his life.

Richards volunteered at Haramokngna American Indian Cultural Center in the [[Angeles National Forest]], where he researched and wrote about the Indigenous plants and their uses amongst the local tribes of Southern California. Botanist author Frank Acuna and [[Tataviam]] tribal leader Rudy Ortega Sr. were vital in this process and its use by the center for a trail guide.

====Bringing the Circle Together====
{{Main|Bringing the Circle Together}}
[[File:Western children's author Lorin Morgan-Richards with his daughter Berlin.jpg|thumb|Lorin Morgan-Richards with his daughter Berlin]] Between 2008 and 2012, Richards partnered with [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] and Indigenous groups in Los Angeles to establish ''[[Bringing the Circle Together]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://feministmagazine.org/2009/03/mar-18-on-fm/ |title=Mar 18 on FM: Women’s Month, Bridge City &amp; So.

The series offered a central gathering place to screen documentaries by and about Indigenous people while providing historical narratives with guest speakers, and art and cultural demonstrations. Special guests included [[Makana (musician)|Makana]], [[Saginaw Grant]], [[Douglas Miles]], [[Blase Bonpane]], among others.

The film series in partnership with AIM Santa Barbara held a community birthday celebration at Nahui Ohlin in Los Angeles for [[Leonard Peltier]] on September 12, 2009, with an update on his status and how the public could get involved to petition his release. Richards spoke to a reporter: "This is all grassroots. Everyone's voice counts. The time is now because Barack Obama, our president, had said it's not the president that actually makes the change, it's going to be our pressure upon the president that will make the change."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://la.indymedia.org/news/2009/09/230316.php |title=Rally for Leonard Peltier : LA IMC |publisher=La.indymedia.org |date= |accessdate=2017-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event was followed in December by a screening of ''Warrior: The Life of Leonard Peltier'' with discussion afterward by Ben Carnes, members of AIM Santa Barbara, as well as friends and family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.janm.org/events/2009/12/ |title=Events &amp;#124; Japanese American National Museum |publisher=Janm.org |date= |accessdate=2017-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

History was made at the film series on February 25, 2010, at the screening of ''Lost Nation: The Ioway'' when representatives of the [[Ioway|Southern Ioway]] and [[Ioway|Northern Ioway]] tribes gathered with [[Tongva people|Tongva]] leaders, making it the first time a meeting took place between Southern California and Midwestern Native American Nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iowaymovie.com/news.htm |title="Lost Nation: The Ioway" - News |publisher=Iowaymovie.com |date= |accessdate=2017-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sacandfoxnation-nsn.gov/sites/sfnation/uploads/documents/News12/july/july_finished_2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Richards published a free journal entitled ''Bringing the Circle Together Magazine'' featuring interviews with contemporary Native American leaders [[Joanne Shenandoah]], [[Greg Grey Cloud]], and [[L. Frank]].

===Celtic Involvement===
[[File:Author and illustrator Lorin Morgan-Richards in Old Town San Diego (33520541991).jpg|thumb|Author and illustrator Lorin Morgan-Richards]]Richards became heavily involved in the Welsh-American community after the untimely closure of the [[Welsh Presbyterian Church (Los Angeles)|Welsh Presbyterian Church]] in December 2012. Before this, Richards had helped coordinate an [[Eisteddfod]] at Barnsdall Art Park in 2011. Feeling a need to fill the void of losing the church as a cultural center, Richards founded the [[Los Angeles St. David's Day Festival]], an annual event taking place on or around March 1 celebrating Wales. The first festival took place on March 1, 2013. Singer and harpist [[Siobhan Owen]] headlined the large-scale event. In conjunction with the festival, Richards began producing [[Celtic Family Magazine]], a nationally distributed print and digital publication on Celtic interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Barton |first=Cath |url=http://www.walesartsreview.org/the-welsh-in-america/ |title=The Welsh in America |publisher=Wales Arts Review |date= |accessdate=2017-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 2015, Richards invited members of the community to form the Welsh League of Southern California which took on the responsibility of the festival and other events in the area. Celtic Family Magazine announced its hiatus in 2017 due to increased production costs.

Richards has since refocused his energy into writing and illustrating full-time.

==Words and phrases coined==
Several words and phrases coined or adopted by Richards have passed into English usage:[[File:Down_West_by_Lorin_Morgan-Richards.jpg|thumb|right|''Down West'' by Lorin Morgan-Richards]]
* '''''Down West''''', a type of the subgenre of [[Weird West]] depicting macabre western humor as seen in his series ''[[The Goodbye Family]]''. The term is also from Richards cartoon collection of the same name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newswhistle.com/the-dreaded-summons-our-qa-with-author-lorin-morgan-richards/ |title=The Dreaded Summons – Our Q&amp;A with Author Lorin Morgan-Richards |publisher=NewsWhistle |date=2017-11-28 |accessdate=2018-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''''Bratniks''''', as a pejorative social [[epithet]] referring to [[Generation Z]] for their quick access to technology and knowledge. Richards playfully explains: "While the beatniks had ''[[On the Road]]'' the Bratniks have ‘On the Phone’. The ironic twist is that neighboring generations can easily be sucked into Generation Z like a black hole – making it very hard to differentiate what time and place you originated. Considering, maybe it’s not so bad after all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://steamkat.com/generatonz-2-2/ |title=Generation Z Gets a New Moniker |publisher=SteamKat! |date= |accessdate=2018-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===As Marcil d’Hirson Garron===
* '''''[[Imperfectualism]]''''': (is) art that cannot be easily replicated by machine. An imperfectualist looks to slow automation through their art. As coined by Marcil d’Hirson Garron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tweet by Lorin Morgan-Richards |url= https://twitter.com/LMorganRichards/status/974737315443568640 |website=Twitter |publisher= |date=2018-03-16 |accessdate=2018-03-16 |quote=Imperfectualism: (is) art that cannot be easily replicated by machine.
