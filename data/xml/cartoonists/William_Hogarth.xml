'''William Hogarth''' [[FRSA]] ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|oʊ|g|ɑr|θ}}; 10 November 1697 – 26 October 1764) was an English painter, [[Printmaking|printmaker]], pictorial [[satire|satirist]], [[Social criticism|social critic]], and editorial [[cartoonist]]. His work ranged from [[Realism (visual arts)|realistic]] portraiture to [[comic strip]]-like series of pictures called "modern moral subjects",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dummies.com/education/art-appreciation/the-rococo-influence-in-british-art/|title=The Rococo Influence in British Art – dummies|work=dummies|access-date=2017-06-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps best known being his moral series ''[[A Harlot's Progress]]'', ''[[A Rake's Progress]]'' and ''[[Marriage A-la-Mode (Hogarth)|Marriage A-la-Mode]]''.  Knowledge of his work is so pervasive that satirical political illustrations in this style are often referred to as "Hogarthian".&lt;ref&gt;According to Elizabeth Einberg, "by the time he died in October 1764 he had left so indelible a mark on the history of British painting that the term 'Hogarthian' remains instantly comprehensible even today as a valid description of a wry, satirical perception of the human condition." See the exhibition catalog, ''Hogarth the Painter'', London: Tate Gallery, 1997, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hogarth was born in London to a lower middle-class family. In his youth he took up an apprenticeship where he specialised in engraving. His father underwent periods of mixed fortune, and was at one time imprisoned in lieu of outstanding debts; an event that is thought to have informed William's paintings and prints with a hard edge.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Paulson, ''Hogarth, vol. 1: The 'Modern Moral Subject', 1697–1732'' (New Brunswick 1991), pp. 26–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

Influenced by French and Italian painting and engraving,&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederick Antal]], ''Hogarth and His Place in European Art'' (London 1962); Robin Simon, ''Hogarth, France and British Art: The rise of the arts in eighteenth-century Britain'' (London 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; Hogarth's works are mostly satirical caricatures, sometimes bawdily sexual,&lt;ref&gt;Bernd W. Krysmanski, ''Hogarth's Hidden Parts: Satiric Allusion, Erotic Wit, Blasphemous Bawdiness and Dark Humour in Eighteenth-Century English Art'' (Hildesheim, Zurich and New York: Georg Olms 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; mostly of the first rank of realistic portraiture. They became widely popular and mass-produced via prints in his lifetime, and he was by far the most significant English artist of his generation.

==Early life==
[[File:William Hogarth by Roubiliac, 1741, National Portrait Gallery, London.JPG|thumb|upright|''William Hogarth'' by [[Roubiliac]], 1741, National Portrait Gallery, London]]
William Hogarth was born at Bartholomew Close in London to Richard Hogarth, a poor [[Latin]] school teacher and textbook writer, and Anne Gibbons. In his youth he was apprenticed to the engraver Ellis Gamble in [[Leicester Fields]], where he learned to engrave [[trade card]]s and similar products.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/term_details.aspx?bioId=6193 Ellis Gamble Biographical Details]. The British Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. H. K. Wright. [https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2ulEAQAAMAAJ&amp;rdid=book-2ulEAQAAMAAJ&amp;rdot=1 The Journal of the Ex Libris Society, Volume 3] (A &amp; C. Black, Plymouth, 1894)&lt;/ref&gt;

Young Hogarth also took a lively interest in the street life of the metropolis and the London fairs, and amused himself by sketching the characters he saw.  Around the same time, his father, who had opened an unsuccessful Latin-speaking [[coffee house]] at [[St John's Gate]], was [[debtor prison|imprisoned for debt]] in [[Fleet Prison]] for five years. Hogarth never spoke of his father's imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Paulson, ''Hogarth'', vol. 1 (New Brunswick 1991), pp. 26–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hogarth became a member of the [[Rose and Crown Club]], with [[Peter Tillemans]], [[George Vertue]], [[Michael Dahl]], and other artists and connoisseurs.&lt;ref&gt;Coombs, Katherine, 'Lens [Laus] family (per. c. 1650–1779), artists' in ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'' (Oxford University Press, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

{{See also|List of works by William Hogarth}}

By April 1720, Hogarth was an [[engraver]] in his own right, at first engraving coats of arms, shop bills, and designing plates for booksellers.

In 1727, he was hired by Joshua Morris, a tapestry worker, to prepare a design for the ''Element of Earth''. Morris heard that he was "an engraver, and no painter", and consequently declined the work when completed. Hogarth accordingly sued him for the money in the [[Westminster Hall#Westminster Hall|Westminster Court]], where the case was decided in his favour on 28 May 1728. In 1757 he was appointed [[Serjeant Painter]] to the King.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Paulson, ''Hogarth'', vol. 3 (New Brunswick 1993), pp. 213–216.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early works===
[[File:HogarthWanstead.jpg|thumb|280px|left|''[[The Assembly at Wanstead House]]''. [[Richard Child, 1st Earl Tylney|Earl Tylney]] and family in foreground]]
Early satirical works included an ''[[Emblematical Print on the South Sea Scheme]]'' (c.1721, published 1724), about the disastrous stock market crash of 1720 known as the [[South Sea Bubble]], in which many English people lost a great deal of money. In the bottom left corner, he shows [[Protestant]], [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], and [[Jewish]] figures gambling, while in the middle there is a huge machine, like a merry-go-round, which people are boarding. At the top is a goat, written below which is "Who'l Ride". The people are scattered around the picture with a sense of disorder, while the progress of the well dressed people towards the ride in the middle shows the foolishness of the crowd in buying stock in the [[South Sea Company]], which spent more time issuing stock than anything else.&lt;ref&gt;See Ronald Paulson, ''Hogarth's Graphic Works'' (3rd edition, London 1989), no. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other early works include ''The Lottery'' (1724); ''The Mystery of Masonry brought to Light by the Gormogons'' (1724);  ''[[A Just View of the British Stage]]'' (1724); some book illustrations; and the small print ''Masquerades and Operas'' (1724). The latter is a satire on contemporary follies, such as the [[masquerade ball|masquerades]] of the Swiss impresario [[John James Heidegger]], the popular Italian [[Opera|opera singers]], [[John Rich (producer)|John Rich]]'s pantomimes at [[Lincoln's Inn Fields]], and the exaggerated popularity of [[Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington|Lord Burlington]]'s protégé, the architect and painter [[William Kent]]. He continued that theme in 1727, with the ''Large Masquerade Ticket''. In 1726 Hogarth prepared twelve large engravings for [[Samuel Butler (1612–1680)|Samuel Butler]]'s ''[[Hudibras]]''. 
[[File:William Hogarth - Self-Portrait - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Self-Portrait'' by Hogarth, ca. 1735, [[Yale Center for British Art]].]] These he himself valued highly, and they are among his best book illustrations.

In the following years he turned his attention to the production of small "[[Conversation piece (paintings)|conversation piece]]s" (i.e., groups in oil of full-length portraits from {{convert|12|to|15|in}} high). Among his efforts in oil between 1728 and 1732 were ''The Fountaine Family'' (c.1730), ''The Assembly at Wanstead House'', ''The House of Commons examining Bambridge'', and several pictures of the chief actors in [[John Gay]]'s popular ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Paulson, ''Hogarth'', vol. 1, pp. 172–185, 206–215.&lt;/ref&gt; One of his real low-life and real-life subjects was [[Sarah Malcolm]] whom he sketched two days before her execution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/exhibition/hogarth/hogarth-room-guide-room-8 Sarah Malcolm], The Hogarth Room, The Tate, retrieved 7 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Hogarth's masterpieces of this period is the depiction of an amateur performance by children of [[John Dryden]]'s ''The Indian Emperor, or The Conquest of Mexico'' (1732–1735) at the home of [[John Conduitt]], master of the mint, in [[Hanover Square, London|St George's Street, Hanover Square]].&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Paulson, ''Hogarth'', vol. 2 (New Brunswick 1992), pp. 1–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hogarth's other works in the 1730s include ''A Midnight Modern Conversation'' (1733), ''Southwark Fair'' (1733), ''The Sleeping Congregation'' (1736), ''Before'' and ''After'' (1736), ''Scholars at a Lecture'' (1736), ''The Company of Undertakers (Consultation of Quacks)'' (1736), ''[[The Distrest Poet]]'' (1736), ''[[The Four Times of the Day]]'' (1738), and ''[[Strolling Actresses Dressing in a Barn]]'' (1738). He might also have printed ''Burlington Gate'' (1731), evoked by [[Alexander Pope]]'s Epistle to [[Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington|Lord Burlington]], and defending Lord Chandos, who is therein satirized. This print gave great offence, and was suppressed. However, modern authorities such as Ronald Paulson no longer attribute it to Hogarth.&lt;ref&gt;See Paulson, ''Hogarth's Graphic Works'', p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moralizing art===

====Harlot's and Rake's Progresses====
[[File:The Rake's Progress 8.jpg|thumb|''[[A Rake's Progress]]'', Plate 8, 1735, and retouched by Hogarth in 1763 by adding the Britannia emblem&lt;ref&gt;[[#JBN1833|J. B. Nichols, 1833]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=2xIEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA192&amp;hl=en p.192] "PLATE VIII. ... Britannia 1763"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#JBN1833|J. B. Nichols, 1833]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=2xIEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA193&amp;hl=en p.193] "Retouched by the Author, 1763"&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In 1731 Hogarth completed the earliest of his series of moral works, a body of work that led to significant recognition. The collection of six scenes was entitled ''[[A Harlot's Progress]]'' and appeared first as paintings (now lost)&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Einberg, ''William Hogarth: A Complete Catalogue of the Paintings'' (New Haven and London: Yale University Press 2016), nos. 21–26.&lt;/ref&gt; before being published as engravings.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Paulson, ''Hogarth's Graphic Works'', 3rd edition (London: The Print Room 1989), nos. 121–126.&lt;/ref&gt; ''A Harlot's Progress'' depicts the fate of a country girl who begins prostituting&amp;nbsp;– the six scenes are chronological, starting with a meeting with a bawd and ending with a funeral ceremony that follows the character's death from venereal disease.&lt;ref&gt;Cruickshank, Dan (2010). ''London's Sinful Secret: The Bawdy History and Very Public Passions of London's Georgian Age''. Macmillan. pp. 19–20. {{ISBN|1429919566}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The inaugural series was an immediate success and was followed in 1733–1735 by the sequel ''[[A Rake's Progress]]''.&lt;ref&gt;For the paintings, see Einberg, ''William Hogarth: A Complete Catalogue of the Paintings'', nos. 74–81. For the engravings, see Paulson, ''Hogarth's Graphic Works'', 3rd edition, nos. 132–139.&lt;/ref&gt; The second instalment consisted of eight pictures that depicted the reckless life of Tom Rakewell, the son of a rich merchant, who spends all of his money on luxurious living, services from prostitutes, and gambling&amp;nbsp;– the character's life ultimately ends in [[Bethlem Royal Hospital]]. The original paintings of ''A Harlot's Progress'' were destroyed in the fire at [[Fonthill Abbey|Fonthill House]] in 1755; the oil paintings of ''A Rake's Progress'' (1733–34) are displayed in the gallery room at [[Sir John Soane's Museum]], London, UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Rake's Progress|url=http://www.soane.org/collections_legacy/the_soane_hogarths/rakes_progress|work=Sir John Soane's Museum|publisher=Sir John Soane's Museum|accessdate=13 December 2013|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the success of ''A Harlot's Progress'' and ''A Rake's Progress'' resulted in numerous pirated reproductions by unscrupulous printsellers, Hogarth lobbied in parliament for greater legal control over the reproduction of his and other artists' work. The result was the [[Engraving Copyright Act 1734|Engravers’ Copyright Act]] (known as ‘Hogarth's Act’), which became law on 25 June 1735 and was the first copyright law to deal with visual works as well as the first to recognize the authorial rights of an individual artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Verhoogt|first1=Robert|title=Art in Reproduction: Nineteenth-century Prints After Lawrence Alma-tadema, Jozef Israels and Ary Scheffer|date=2007|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|location=Amsterdam|isbn=9053569138|pages=15–16|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jSDnRo7YrWwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Marriage à-la-mode====
[[Image:Marriage A-la-Mode 2, The Tête à Tête - William Hogarth.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Marriage à-la-mode (Hogarth)|Marriage à-la-mode]]'', ''[[Marriage à-la-mode: 2. The Tête à Tête|Shortly After the Marriage]]'' (scene two of six).]]
[[File:Marriage A-la-Mode 4, The Toilette - William Hogarth.jpg|thumbnail|''Marriage à-la-mode'', ''[[Marriage à-la-mode: 4. The Toilette|After the old Earl's funeral]]'' (scene four of six)]]

In 1743–1745, Hogarth painted the six pictures of ''[[Marriage à-la-mode (Hogarth)|Marriage à-la-mode]]'' ([[National Gallery, London]]),&lt;ref&gt;Judy Egerton, ''Hogarth's 'Marriage A-la-Mode' '', London: The National Gallery 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; a pointed skewering of upper-class 18th-century society. This moralistic warning shows the miserable tragedy of an ill-considered marriage for money. This is regarded by many as his finest project and may be among his best-planned story serials.

Marital ethics were the topic of much debate in 18th-century Britain. The many marriages of convenience and their attendant unhappiness came in for particular criticism, with a variety of authors taking the view that love was a much sounder basis for marriage. Hogarth here painted a satire – a genre that by definition has a moral point to convey – of a conventional marriage within the English upper class. All the paintings were engraved and the series achieved wide circulation in print form. The series, which is set in a Classical interior, shows the story of the fashionable marriage of Viscount Squanderfield, the son of bankrupt Earl Squander, to the daughter of a wealthy but miserly city merchant, starting with the signing of a marriage contract at the Earl's mansion and ending with the murder of the son by his wife's lover and the suicide of the daughter after her lover is hanged at [[Tyburn, London|Tyburn]] for murdering her husband.

[[William Makepeace Thackeray]] wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;This famous set of pictures contains the most important and highly wrought of the Hogarth comedies. The care and method with which the moral grounds of these pictures are laid is as remarkable as the wit and skill of the observing and dexterous artist. He has to describe the negotiations for a marriage pending between the daughter of a rich citizen Alderman and young Lord Viscount Squanderfield, the dissipated son of a gouty old Earl ... The dismal end is known. My lord draws upon the counselor, who kills him, and is apprehended while endeavouring to escape. My lady goes back perforce to the Alderman of the City, and faints upon reading Counsellor Silvertongue's dying speech at Tyburn (place of execution in old London), where the counselor has been 'executed for sending his lordship out of the world. Moral: don’t listen to evil silver-tongued counselors; don't marry a man for his rank, or a woman for her money; don't frequent foolish auctions and masquerade balls unknown to your husband; don't have wicked companions abroad and neglect your wife, otherwise you will be run through the body, and ruin will ensue, and disgrace, and Tyburn.&lt;ref&gt;Thackeray, William Makepeace, ''The English Humourists of the Eighteenth Century''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
{{Clear}}

====Industry and Idleness====
[[Image:William Hogarth - Industry and Idleness, Plate 1; The Fellow 'Prentices at their Looms.png|thumb|right|''Industry and Idleness'' Plate 1, The Fellow 'Prentices at their Looms]]
In the twelve prints of ''[[Industry and Idleness]]'' (1747)&lt;ref&gt;Paulson, ''Hogarth's Graphic Works'', 3rd edition, nos. 168–179.&lt;/ref&gt; Hogarth shows the progression in the lives of two apprentices, one of whom is dedicated and hard working, while the other, who is idle, commits crime and is eventually executed. This shows the work ethic of [[Protestantism|Protestant]] England, where those who worked hard were rewarded, such as the industrious apprentice who becomes [[Sheriff of London|Sheriff]] (plate 8), [[Alderman]] (plate 10), and finally the [[Sheriffs of the City of London|Lord Mayor]] of London in the last plate in the series. The idle apprentice, who begins "at play in the church yard" (plate 3), holes up "in a Garrett with a Common Prostitute" after turning [[highwayman]] (plate 7) and "executed at Tyburn" (plate 11). The idle apprentice is sent to the [[gallows]] by the industrious apprentice himself. For each plate, there is at least one passage from the Bible at the bottom, most from the [[Book of Proverbs]], such as for the first plate of "Industry and Idleness, shown here, "Proverbs Ch:10 Ver:4  The hand of the diligent maketh rich."

====Beer Street and Gin Lane====
[[Image:GinLane.jpg|''[[Gin Lane]]''|thumb]]

Later prints of significance include his pictorial warning of the consequences of alcoholism in [[Beer Street and Gin Lane|''Beer Street'' and ''Gin Lane'']] (1751).&lt;ref&gt;Paulson, ''Hogarth's Graphic Works'', 3rd edition, nos. 185–186.&lt;/ref&gt; Hogarth engraved ''Beer Street'' to show a happy city drinking the 'good' beverage, English [[beer]], in contrast to ''Gin Lane'', in which the effects of drinking gin are shown – as a more potent liquor, gin caused more problems for society.&lt;ref&gt;See Mark Hallett, ''The Spectacle of Difference'' (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1999), pp.198–222.&lt;/ref&gt; People are shown as healthy, happy and prosperous in ''Beer Street'', while in ''Gin Lane'' they are scrawny, lazy and careless. The woman at the front of ''Gin Lane'', who lets her baby fall to its death, echoes the tale of Judith Dufour, who strangled her baby so she could sell its clothes for gin money.&lt;ref&gt;See [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/11202643/Hogarth-the-father-of-the-modern-cartoon.html "Hogarth, the father of the modern cartoon", ''The Telegraph'', 13 May 2015.]&lt;/ref&gt; The prints were published in support of the [[Gin Act 1751]].

Hogarth's friend, the magistrate [[Henry Fielding]], may have enlisted Hogarth to help with propaganda for the Gin Act: ''Beer Street'' and ''Gin Lane'' were issued shortly after his work ''An Enquiry into the Causes of the Late Increase of Robbers, and Related Writings'', and addressed the same issues.&lt;ref&gt;See [https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pd/w/william_hogarth,_beer_street.aspx "William Hogarth, Beer Street and Gin Lane, two prints", British Museum.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151031115252/http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pd/w/william_hogarth,_beer_street.aspx |date=31 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Four Stages of Cruelty====
Other prints were his outcry against inhumanity in ''[[The Four Stages of Cruelty]]'' (published 21 February 1751),&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Paulson, ''Hogarth's Graphic Works'', 3rd edition (London: The Print Room 1989), nos. 168–179.&lt;/ref&gt; in which Hogarth depicts the cruel treatment of animals which he saw around him and suggests what will happen to people who carry on in this manner. In the first picture there are scenes of torture of dogs, cats and other animals. The second shows one of the characters from the first painting, Tom Nero, has now become a coach driver, and his cruelty to his horse has caused it to break its leg. In the third painting Tom is shown as a murderer, with the woman he killed lying on the ground, while in the fourth, titled ''Reward of Cruelty'', the murderer is shown being dissected by scientists after his execution.  The method of execution, and the dissection, reflect the 1752 [[Act of Parliament]] allowing for the dissection of executed criminals who had been convicted for murder.

===Portraits===
[[File:William Hogarth - David Garrick as Richard III - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[David Garrick]] as Richard III, 1745]]
[[File:Hogarth, William - Portrait of a Man - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Portrait of a Man, 1741]]

Hogarth was also a popular [[portrait painter]]. In 1745 he painted actor [[David Garrick]] as [[Richard III (play)|Richard III]],&lt;ref&gt;Einberg, ''William Hogarth: A Complete Catalogue of the Paintings'', no. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; for which he was paid £200, "which was more", he wrote, "than any English artist ever received for a single portrait." In 1746 a sketch of [[Simon Fraser, 11th Lord Lovat]], afterwards beheaded on Tower Hill, had an exceptional success.&lt;ref&gt;Paulson, ''Hogarth's Graphic Works'', 3rd edition, no. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1740&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, Ellis. (1994) ''Painting in Britain 1530–1790''. 5th edn. New Haven and London: [[Yale University Press]], p. 175. {{ISBN|0300058330}}&lt;/ref&gt; he created a truthful, vivid full-length portrait of his friend, the philanthropic [[Thomas Coram|Captain Coram]] for the [[Thomas Coram Foundation for Children]], now in the [[Foundling Museum]],&lt;ref&gt;Einberg, ''William Hogarth: A Complete Catalogue of the Paintings'', no. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; and his unfinished oil sketch of a young fishwoman, entitled ''[[The Shrimp Girl]]'' ([[National Gallery, London]]),&lt;ref&gt;Einberg, ''William Hogarth: A Complete Catalogue of the Paintings'', no. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; may be called masterpieces of [[British painting]]. There are also portraits of his wife and his two sisters, and of many other people, among them Bishop [[Benjamin Hoadly|Hoadly]] and Bishop [[Thomas Herring|Herring]].

===Historical subjects===
For a long period of his life, Hogarth tried to achieve the status of [[history painter]], but had no great success in this field.

====Biblical scenes====
Examples of his history pictures are ''The Pool of Bethesda'' and ''The Good Samaritan'', executed in 1736–1737 for [[St Bartholomew's Hospital]];&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Einberg, ''William Hogarth: A Complete Catalogue of the Paintings'' (New Haven and London: Yale University Press 2016), nos. 90–91.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Moses brought before Pharaoh's Daughter'', painted for the [[Foundling Hospital]] (1747, formerly at the [[Thomas Coram Foundation for Children]], now in the [[Foundling Museum]]);&lt;ref&gt;Einberg, ''William Hogarth: A Complete Catalogue of the Paintings'', no. 198.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Paul before Felix'' (1748) at [[Lincoln's Inn]];&lt;ref&gt;Einberg, ''William Hogarth: A Complete Catalogue of the Paintings'', no. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; and his altarpiece for [[St. Mary Redcliffe]], [[Bristol]] (1755–56).&lt;ref&gt;Einberg, ''William Hogarth: A Complete Catalogue of the Paintings'', no. 222.&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Gate of Calais====
''[[The Gate of Calais]]'' (1748; now in [[Tate Britain]]) was produced soon after his return from a visit to France.&lt;ref&gt;Einberg, ''William Hogarth: A Complete Catalogue of the Paintings'', no. 201.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Horace Walpole]] wrote that Hogarth had run a great risk to go there since the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|peace of Aix-la-Chapelle]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;he went to France, and was so imprudent as to be taking a sketch of the drawbridge at [[Calais]]. He was seized and carried to the governor, where he was forced to prove his vocation by producing several [[caricatures]] of the French; particularly a scene of the shore, with an immense piece of beef landing for the ''Lion d'argent'', the English inn at Calais, and several hungry friars following it. They were much diverted with his drawings, and dismissed him.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Back home, he immediately executed a painting of the subject in which he unkindly represented his enemies, the [[French people|Frenchmen]], as cringing, emaciated and superstitious people, while an enormous sirloin of beef arrives, destined for the English inn as a symbol of British prosperity and superiority. He claimed to have painted himself into the picture in the left corner sketching the gate, with a "soldier's hand upon my shoulder", running him in.&lt;ref&gt;[[#JBN1833|J. B. Nichols, 1833]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=nwgIAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=%22William+Hogarth%22&amp;as_brr=1&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1#PPA63,M1 p.63] "in one corner introduced my own portrait"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other later works===

Notable Hogarth engravings in the 1740s include ''[[The Enraged Musician]]'' (1741), the six prints of ''[[Marriage à-la-mode (Hogarth)|Marriage à-la-mode]]'' (1745; executed by French artists under Hogarth's inspection), and ''The Stage Coach or The Country Inn Yard'' (1747).&lt;ref&gt;Paulson, ''Hogarth's Graphic Works'', 3rd edition, nos. 152, 158–163, 167.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1745 Hogarth painted a self-portrait with his pug dog [[Trump (dog)|Trump]] (now also in [[Tate Britain]]), which shows him as a learned artist supported by volumes of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], [[John Milton|Milton]] and [[Jonathan Swift|Swift]].&lt;ref&gt;Einberg, ''William Hogarth: A Complete Catalogue of the Paintings'', no. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1749, he represented the somewhat disorderly English troops on their ''[[March of the Guards to Finchley]]'' (formerly located in [[Thomas Coram Foundation for Children]], now [[Foundling Museum]]).&lt;ref&gt;Einberg, ''William Hogarth: A Complete Catalogue of the Paintings'', no. 207.&lt;/ref&gt;

Others works included his ingenious ''[[Satire on False Perspective]]'' (1754);&lt;ref&gt;Paulson, ''Hogarth's Graphic Works'', 3rd edition, no. 232.&lt;/ref&gt; his satire on canvassing in his ''[[Humours of an Election|Election]]'' series (1755–1758; now in [[Sir John Soane's Museum]]);&lt;ref&gt;Einberg, ''William Hogarth: A Complete Catalogue of the Paintings'', nos. 214–217.&lt;/ref&gt; his ridicule of the English passion for [[cockfighting]] in ''The Cockpit'' (1759); his attack on [[Methodism]] in ''[[Credulity, Superstition, and Fanaticism]]'' (1762); his political anti-war satire in ''The Times'', plate I (1762); and his pessimistic view of all things in ''Tailpiece, or The Bathos'' (1764).&lt;ref&gt;Paulson, ''Hogarth's Graphic Works'', 3rd edition, nos. 206, 210a, 211, 216.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writing===
[[File:Analysis of Beauty Plate 1 by William Hogarth.jpg|thumb|''[[The Analysis of Beauty]]'' plate 1 (1753)]]
Hogarth wrote and published his ideas of artistic design in his book ''[[The Analysis of Beauty]]'' (1753).&lt;ref&gt;William Hogarth, ''The Analysis of Beauty'' (1753), ed. Ronald Paulson (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1997 {{ISBN|978-0-300-07346-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it, he professes to define the principles of beauty and grace which he, a real child of [[Rococo]], saw realized in serpentine lines (the [[Line of Beauty]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/r/rococo|title=Rococo – Art Term {{!}} Tate|last=Tate|work=Tate|access-date=2017-06-23|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; By some of Hogarth's adherents, the book was praised as a fine deliverance upon aesthetics; by his enemies and rivals, its obscurities and minor errors were made the subject of endless ridicule and caricature.&lt;ref&gt;Timbs, John (1881). [https://books.google.com/books?id=gF5JAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA57&amp;dq= ''Anecdote Lives of William Hogarth, Sir Joshua Reynolds, Thomas Gainsborough, Henry Fuseli, Sir Thomas Lawrence, and J.M.W. Turner'']. R. Bentley. pp. 57–58.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Painter and engraver of modern moral subjects===
Hogarth lived in an age when artwork became increasingly commercialized, being viewed in shop windows, [[tavern]]s, and public buildings, and sold in [[old master print|printshop]]s. Old hierarchies broke down, and new forms began to flourish: the [[ballad opera]], the [[bourgeois tragedy]], and especially, a new form of [[fiction]] called the [[novel]] with which authors such as [[Henry Fielding]] had great success. Therefore, by that time, Hogarth hit on a new idea: "painting and engraving modern moral subjects ... to treat my subjects as a dramatic writer; my picture was my stage", as he himself remarked in his manuscript notes.

He drew from the highly moralizing [[Protestant]] tradition of Dutch [[genre painting]], and the very vigorous satirical traditions of the English [[broadsheet]] and other types of popular print. In England the fine arts had little comedy in them before Hogarth. His prints were expensive, and remained so until early 19th-century reprints brought them to a wider audience.

===Parodic borrowings from Old Masters===
When analysing the work of the artist as a whole, [[Ronald Paulson]] says, "In ''[[A Harlot's Progress]]'', every single plate but one is based on [[Albrecht Dürer|Dürer]]'s images of the story of the [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Virgin]] and the story of the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]]." In other works, he parodies [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s [[The Last Supper (Leonardo)|Last Supper]]. According to Paulson, Hogarth is subverting the religious establishment and the orthodox belief in an immanent [[God]] who intervenes in the lives of people and produces [[miracle]]s. Indeed, Hogarth was a [[Deist]], a believer in a God who created the universe but takes no direct hand in the lives of his creations. Thus, as a "comic history painter", he often poked fun at the old-fashioned, "beaten" subjects of religious art in his paintings and prints. Hogarth also rejected [[Anthony Ashley Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury|Lord Shaftesbury]]'s then-current ideal of the [[Art in ancient Greece#Classical|classical Greek]] male in favour of the living, breathing female. He said, "Who but a bigot, even to the [[antiques]], will say that he has not seen faces and necks, hands and arms in living women, that even the Grecian [[Venus (goddess)|Venus]] doth but coarsely imitate."

==Personal life==

On 23 March 1729 Hogarth married Jane Thornhill, daughter of artist Sir [[James Thornhill]].

Hogarth was initiated as a [[Freemason]] before 1728 in the Lodge at the Hand and Apple Tree Tavern, Little Queen Street, and later belonged to the Carrier Stone Lodge and the Grand Stewards' Lodge; the latter still possesses the 'Hogarth Jewel' which Hogarth designed for the Lodge's Master to wear.&lt;ref&gt;See references in [http://www.freemasons-freemasonry.com/beresiner11.html this biography].&lt;/ref&gt; Today the original is in storage and a replica is worn by the Master of the Lodge. Freemasonry was a theme in some of Hogarth's work, most notably 'Night', the fourth in the quartet of paintings (later released as engravings) collectively entitled the ''[[Four Times of the Day]]''.

His main home was in Leicester Square (then known as Leicester Fields), but he bought a country retreat in [[Chiswick]] in 1749, the house now known as [[Hogarth's House]] and preserved as a museum, and spent time there for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hounslow.info/arts-culture/historic-houses-museums/hogarth-house/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180123103341/http://www.hounslow.info/arts-culture/historic-houses-museums/hogarth-house/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2018-01-23|title=Hogarth’s House {{!}} Hounslow.info|date=2018-01-23|access-date=2018-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.camdennewjournal.co.uk/031005/n031005_24.htm |title=Camden New Journal |author=Joel Taylor |work=camdennewjournal.co.uk |date=11 March 2005 |accessdate=21 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Hogarths had no children, although they fostered foundling children. He was a founding Governor of the [[Foundling Hospital]].

Among his friends and acquaintances were many English artists and satirists of the period, such as [[Francis Hayman]], [[Henry Fielding]], and [[Laurence Sterne]].

==Death==
[[File:William Hogarth's tomb.jpg|thumb|upright|Tomb of William and Jane Hogarth]]

Hogarth died in London on 26 October 1764 and was buried at [[St. Nicholas Church, Chiswick]], London. His friend, actor [[David Garrick]], composed the following inscription for his tombstone:

:''Farewell great Painter of Mankind''
:''Who reach'd the noblest point of Art''
:''Whose pictur'd Morals charm the Mind''
:''And through the Eye correct the Heart.''

:''If Genius fire thee, Reader, stay,''
:''If Nature touch thee, drop a Tear:''
:''If neither move thee, turn away,''
:''For Hogarth's honour'd dust lies here.''

==Influence and reputation==
Hogarth's works were a direct influence on [[John Collier (caricaturist)|John Collier]], who was known as the "Lancashire Hogarth".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Hignett|first=Tim|publisher=George Kelsall Publishing|year=1991|title=Milnrow &amp; Newhey: A Lancashire Legacy|isbn=0-946571-19-8|location=[[Littleborough, Greater Manchester|Littleborough]]|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spread of Hogarth's prints throughout Europe, together with the depiction of popular scenes from his prints in faked Hogarth prints, influenced Continental book illustration through the 18th and early 19th centuries, especially in Germany and France. He also influenced many caricaturists of the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries. Hogarth's influence lives on today as artists continue to draw inspiration from his work.

Hogarth's paintings and prints have provided the subject matter for several other works. For example, [[Gavin Gordon (composer)|Gavin Gordon]]'s 1935 ballet ''[[The Rake's Progress (ballet)|The Rake's Progress]]'', to choreography by [[Ninette de Valois]], was based directly on Hogarth's series of paintings of that title. [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s 1951 [[opera]] ''[[The Rake's Progress]]'', with libretto by [[W. H. Auden]], was less literally inspired by the same series. Hogarth's engravings also inspired the [[BBC radio]] play ''The Midnight House'' by Jonathan Hall, based on the [[M. R. James]] ghost story "[[The Mezzotint]]" and first broadcast on [[BBC Radio 4]] in 2006.

[[Russell Banks]]' short story "Indisposed" is a fictional account of Hogarth's infidelity as told from the viewpoint of his wife, Jane. Hogarth was the lead character in [[Nick Dear]]'s play ''[[The Art of Success]]'', whilst he is played by [[Toby Jones]] in the 2006 television film ''[[A Harlot's Progress (film)|A Harlot's Progress]]''.

[[Hogarth's House]] in [[Chiswick]], west London, is now a museum; it abuts one of London's best known [[road junction]]s – the [[Hogarth Roundabout]]. In 2014 both Hogarth's House and the Foundling Museum held special exhibitions to mark the 250th anniversary of his death.
