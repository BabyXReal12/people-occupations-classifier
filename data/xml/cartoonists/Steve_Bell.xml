'''Steven Bell''' (born 26 February 1951) is an English political [[cartoonist]], whose work appears in ''[[The Guardian]]'' and other publications. He is known for his [[left-wing]] views.

==Early life==
Born in [[Walthamstow]], [[London]], and raised in [[Slough]], Bell moved to [[North Yorkshire]] with his family in 1968, where he trained as an artist at the [[Teesside College of Art]]. He graduated in film-making and art from the [[University of Leeds]] in 1974 and trained as an art teacher at St Luke's College, Exeter (now [[St Luke's Campus]] at the [[University of Exeter]]) in 1975. He taught art for one year in [[Birmingham]] before becoming a freelance cartoonist in 1977. His [[comic strip]] ''Maggie's Farm'' appeared in the London [[listings magazine]] ''[[Time Out (company)|Time Out]]'' from 1979 and later in ''[[City Limits (London magazine)|City Limits]]'', and ''Lord God Almighty'' appeared in ''[[Leveller magazine|The Leveller]]'' in the 1970s. In 1980 he contributed a cartoon interpretation of the lyrics to ''Ivan Meets G.I. Joe'' to the inner lyric bag of [[the Clash]]'s triple album ''[[Sandinista!]]''

==Cartoonist==
Steve Bell is probably best known for the daily strip called ''[[If... (comic)|If...]]'', which has appeared in ''The Guardian'' newspaper since 1981, and since the mid-1990s he has also been that newspaper's principal editorial cartoonist.

Collections of his [[cartoon]]s have been published, and he has also illustrated original books in collaboration with authors. He has made short animated films with [[Bob Godfrey]], including a short series of animated cartoons for [[Channel 4]] television in 1999 to mark the 20th anniversary of Margaret Thatcher's rise to power, entitled ''Margaret Thatcher – Where Am I Now?'' He has appeared in a radio programme about the life of 18th century caricaturist [[James Gillray]]. Earlier in his career he wrote and drew the [[Gremlins (comic strip)|''Gremlins'']] comic strip for the [[British comics|British comic]] ''[[Jackpot (comic)|Jackpot]]''.

Bell's parodies include [[Goya]]'s ''[[The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters]]'' (in an editorial cartoon about the [[UK Independence Party]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/cartoons/stevebell/0,7371,1234690,00.html|title=09.06.04: Robert Kilroy-Silk and the UKIP - Cartoons - guardian.co.uk|website=www.theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;); [[William Hogarth]]'s ''[[The Gate of Calais]]'' about the ban on UK meat exports following outbreaks of [[foot-and-mouth disease]] and bovine [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy|BSE]]; and – before the 2005 General Election when it briefly seemed as if the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] might seriously threaten [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] – [[J. M. W. Turner]]'s ''[[The Fighting Temeraire]]'', in which a chirpy [[Charles Kennedy]] as [[tug-boat]] towed a grotesque and dilapidated [[Tony Blair]] to be broken up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/cartoons/stevebell/0,7371,1470547,00.html|title=26.04.05: Tony Blair and Iraq - Cartoons - guardian.co.uk|website=www.theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the death of [[Margaret Thatcher]], for his cartoon the next day, 9 April 2013, Bell adapted [[:File:DVinfernoUbertiAddressesDante m.jpg|an illustration]] by [[Gustave Doré]] of [[Farinata degli Uberti|Farinata]] in [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'', giving Thatcher the speech bubble "Why is this pit still open??" with reference to the closure of coal mines after the [[UK miners' strike (1984–1985)|miners' strike of 1984–85]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cartoon/2013/apr/08/margaret-thatcher-death-steve-bell-cartoon|title=Steve Bell on Margaret Thatcher's death – cartoon|first=Steve|last=Bell|publisher=|via=www.theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bell's cartoons regularly feature grotesque caricatures, and have sometimes caused controversy as well as receiving critical acclaim. During the [[Operation Pillar of Defense|November 2012 Israel/Gaza conflict]] ''The Guardian'' published a cartoon by Bell showing the Israeli Prime Minister, [[Benjamin Netanyahu]], as a puppeteer controlling [[William Hague]] and [[Tony Blair]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cartoon/2012/nov/15/israel-gaza "Steve Bell on Tony Blair and William Hague's role in Israel-Gaza clash – cartoon"], ''The Guardian'' (website), 15 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dave Rich]], blogging for the [[Community Security Trust]], said that the illustration was comparable to those featured in Nazi and other antisemitic publications.&lt;ref&gt;Dave Rich [http://blog.thecst.org.uk/?p=3931 "Jews, puppets and the Guardian"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121129203536/http://blog.thecst.org.uk/?p=3931 |date=29 November 2012 }}, Community Security Trust *(blog), 16 November 2012,&lt;/ref&gt; While Bell defended his cartoon,&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Lipman [http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/91862/steve-bell-defends-guardian-cartoon "Steve Bell defends Guardian cartoon"], ''The Jewish Chronicle'', 22 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt; the newspaper's readers' editor Chris Elliott concluded in an article on 25 November: "While journalists and cartoonists should be free to express an opinion that Netanyahu is opportunistic and manipulative, in my view they should not use the language – including the visual language – of antisemitic stereotypes."&lt;ref&gt;Chris Elliott [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/nov/25/accusations-of-antisemitism-political-cartoon "Open door: The readers' editor on… accusations of antisemitism against a political cartoon"], ''The Guardian'', 25 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The UK's [[Press Complaints Commission]] PCC received 22 complaints, but ruled on 19 December that it was unable to take the matter further.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Lipman [http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/94664/pcc-rules-no-breach-over-steve-bell-gaza-cartoon "PCC rules no breach over Steve Bell Gaza cartoon",] ''The Jewish Chronicle'', 19 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In the run-up to the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015]], there was outrage on [[Twitter]] over an ''If...'' cartoon strip depicting [[Scottish National Party]] (SNP) leader [[Nicola Sturgeon]] as refusing to compromise on their "core demand" for  "incest and Scottish folk dancing". Numerous tweets branded Bell as racist, while others said that it was no more outrageous than his cartoons mocking other politicians.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Sommers [http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2015/03/09/snp-steve-bell-if-guardian_n_6831028.html "SNP Guardian Cartoon By Steve Bell Branded 'Racist' In Social Media Outrage"], ''The Huffington Post'', 11 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; There were over 300 complaints made to ''The Guardian'' and nearly 1,000 comments under the online cartoon, mostly negative. The wording referred to a quotation attributed to Sir [[Arnold Bax]], who said a Scottish friend had told him "You should make a point of trying every experience once, excepting incest and folk dancing".&lt;ref name="Elliott 2015"&gt;{{cite web | last=Elliott | first=Chris | title=I may not always agree with Steve Bell, but I defend his right to draw | website=the Guardian | date=15 Mar 2015 | url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/mar/15/cartoonist-steve-bell-defend-right-to-draw | accessdate=30 Sep 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Scottish independence referendum, 2014]], Bell's cartoon strip depicted Sturgeon's "Yes" campaigning as promising "No Noness ... and Yes Yesness; Nationalism, Socialism: together they go so well!!"&lt;ref name="Bell 2014"&gt;{{cite web | last=Bell | first=Steve | title=Steve Bell's If ... on Nicola Sturgeon's new Scotland | website=the Guardian | date=13 November 2014 | url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cartoon/2014/nov/13/steve-bells-if-nicola-sturgeon-scotland | accessdate=30 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
