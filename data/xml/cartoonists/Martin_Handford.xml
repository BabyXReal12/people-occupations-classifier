'''Martin Handford''' (born 27 September 1956)&lt;ref name=Scholastic&gt;[http://clubs-kids.scholastic.co.uk/clubs_content/2168 "Interview with Martin Handford"], [[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic]] Book Club. Retrieved 7 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Children's Books and Their Creators. p. 668.&lt;/ref&gt; is an English children's [[author]] and [[illustrator]] who gained worldwide fame in the mid-1980s with his ''[[Where's Wally?]]'' creation (known as ''Where's Waldo?'' in North America).

==Early life==
Born in Hampstead, London, Handford was a solitary child, born to divorced parents. He began drawing crowds when he was 4 or 5 years old, and later as a child, making stick figures on paper.&lt;ref name=EW/&gt; After school, when most other children he knew would go out and play games, he would draw pictures instead.&lt;ref name=EW/&gt; His inspiration to draw such figures came from classic films and the toy soldiers he played with during that era.

As an adult, Handford worked for three years in an insurance office (Crusader Insurance Company) to pay for his degree at art college. He studied art at UCA ([[University for the Creative Arts]]) formerly KIAD (Kent Institute of Art and Design) in Maidstone, Kent. After graduating, Martin worked as a freelance illustrator specialising in drawing crowd scenes for numerous clients.&lt;ref name=Scholastic/&gt;

==Career==
Martin Handford created the album cover for [[The Vapors]]' 1981 album ''[[Magnets (album)|Magnets]]''. The cover features an assassination scene which forms the shape of an eye.

In 1986, Handford was asked by his art director at Walker Books to draw a character with peculiar features so that his pictures of crowds had a focal point. After much thinking, he came up with the idea of "Wally", a world traveller and time travel aficionado who always dresses in red and white.&lt;ref name=EW&gt;[http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,318859_2,00.html "Up Against the Waldo"], by Cyndi Stivers, 14 December 1990, ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''. Retrieved 8 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Wally is joined on most of his travels by his friend, Wenda, who wears clothes with the same colours as Wally's, and by an evil character named Odlaw (Waldo spelled backwards) who dresses in yellow and black.

Handford became a minor celebrity with the success of ''Where's Wally?''. The ''Where's Wally?'' trademark sold in 28 different countries. Beginning in 1987, Handford produced a total of seven "classic" ''Where's Wally?'' books, but his character was branched out into other products, such as [[notebook]]s, [[pillow]]s, [[poster]]s, [[video game]]s and many others. There was even a syndicated comic strip as well as an animated TV series.

Handford has gained the reputation of being a methodical and diligent worker: sometimes it would take him up to eight weeks to draw one two-page sketch "Wally" and the characters surrounding him.&lt;ref name=Scholastic/&gt; The drawings are drawn to the same scale as in the books and each 2-page spread usually contains about 300 to 500 figures, with Wally often being the last character drawn into the crowd. &lt;ref name=Independent/&gt;

The ''Where's Wally?'' books were published in the UK by [[Walker Books]] and in the US under the title ''Where's Waldo?'' first by [[Little, Brown and Company]] before being taken on by [[Candlewick Press]] (Walker Books' American subsidiary publishing company). The first four titles were originally printed in Italy, but later reprinted in China.

A film based on the ''Where's Wally?'' series of books was planned for filming in 2005 by [[Nickelodeon Movies]] but was cancelled due to a management change at [[Paramount Pictures]].

In 2007, Handford sold the rights to ''Where's Wally?'' to the [[Entertainment Rights|Entertainment Rights Group]], the world's biggest independent owner of children's brands.&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/jan/22/6 "Where's Wally founder tracks down a fortune"], Fiona Walsh, ''[[The Guardian]]'', 22 January 2007. Retrieved 7 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; He is said to have made £2.5m in this sale. &lt;ref name=Independent/&gt;

The style of art executed by Handford is probably the most famous example of "[[Wimmelbilderbuch]]" drawings, originally popularised by [[Hieronymus Bosch]], [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder]] and [[Hans Jürgen Press]].

== Personal life ==

According to his publishers Handford is a shy, creative genius who is very dedicated to his work and has no interest in publicity. He listens to the [[Bee Gees]], [[the Clash]] or old ''[[The Phil Silvers Show|Sergeant Bilko]]'' tapes while he works.  &lt;ref name=Independent&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/wheres-the-brains-behind-wally-6261459.html "Where's the brains behind Wally?"], Paul Bignell, ''[[The Independent]]'', 13 November 2011. Retrieved 24 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;
