He is the creator of the [[Nickelodeon]] television series ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' (1999{{ndash}}), which he has also directed, produced, and written. It has gone on to become one of the [[List of longest-running United States television series|longest-running American television series]] as well as the highest-rated show ever to air on Nickelodeon.

Born in [[Lawton, Oklahoma]] and raised in [[Anaheim, California]], Hillenburg became fascinated with the ocean as a child and developed an interest in art. He started his professional career in 1984, instructing marine biology, at the [[Ocean Institute|Orange County Marine Institute]], where he wrote ''The Intertidal Zone'', an informative comic book about [[tide pool|tide-pool]] animals, which he used to educate his students. In 1989, two years after leaving teaching, Hillenburg enrolled at the [[California Institute of the Arts]] to pursue a career in animation. He was later offered a job on the Nickelodeon animated television series ''[[Rocko's Modern Life]]'' (1993{{ndash}}1996) after his success with short films ''The Green Beret'' and ''Wormholes'' (both 1992), which he made while studying animation.

In 1994, Hillenburg began developing ''The Intertidal Zone'' characters and concepts for what became ''SpongeBob SquarePants''. The show premiered in 1999 and has aired since then. He also directed ''[[The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie]]'' (2004), which he originally intended to be the [[series finale]]. However, Nickelodeon wanted to produce more episodes, so Hillenburg resigned as the [[showrunner]]. He went back to making short films, with ''Hollywood Blvd., USA'' (2013). In 2015, ''[[The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water]]'' premiered; the sequel to the 2004 film, it marked Hillenburg's return to the show, after he co-wrote the story.

Besides his two [[Emmy Award]]s and six [[Annie Award]]s for ''SpongeBob SquarePants'', Hillenburg has also received other recognition, such as an accolade from [[Heal the Bay]] for his efforts on elevating marine life awareness, and the [[National Cartoonists Society Division Awards#Television Animation Award|Television Animation Award]] from the [[National Cartoonists Society]]. Despite this, he has been involved in public controversies, including one that centered on speculation over the [[SpongeBob SquarePants (character)|SpongeBob]] character's intended sexual orientation, and a lawsuit that was filed against him. Hillenburg has been diagnosed with [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS) in 2017, but stated he would continue to work on his show.

An illustration that he drew in third grade, depicting "a bunch of army men{{nbsp}}... kissing and hugging instead of fighting", brought him the first praise for his artwork, when his teacher commended it.&lt;ref name="Big Pop Fun"/&gt; "Of course, this is 1970{{nbsp}}... She liked it because, I mean, obviously that was in the middle of [the [[Vietnam War]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. She was, I would imagine, not a hundred percent for the war like a lot of people then. ...{{nbsp}}I had no idea about the implications, really, because I just thought it was a funny idea. I remember that still, that moment when she said, 'oh my gosh, look at that'", Hillenburg elaborated.&lt;ref name="Big Pop Fun"/&gt; It was then he knew he "had some [creative] skill".&lt;ref name="Big Pop Fun"/&gt; He asserts that his artistry came from his mother's side, despite his father being a draftsman, noting that his maternal grandmother was "really, really gifted" and a "great painter".&lt;ref name="Big Pop Fun"/&gt;

In the 1970s, someone took Hillenburg to the [[International Tournée of Animation]] at the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]]. He was "knocked out" by the foreign animated films, including Dutch animator [[Paul Driessen (animator)|Paul Driessen]]'s ''[[The Killing of an Egg]]'' (1977). "That was the film that I thought was uniquely strange and that lodged itself in my head early on," he recounted.&lt;ref name="WP Interview"/&gt;

Hillenburg explained that "anything goes" in experimental animation. Although this allowed him to explore alternatives to conventional methods of filmmaking, he still ventured to employ his own style, which he called "an industry style"; he preferred to [[traditional animation|traditionally animate]] his films (where each [[Film frame|frame]] is drawn by hand) rather than, for instance, make cartoons "out of sand by filming piles of sand changing".&lt;ref name="Big Pop Fun"/&gt; Hillenburg has at least one other short film that he made as an animation student but its title is unspecified.&lt;ref name="WP Interview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Makin' Toons"/&gt;

===''Rocko's Modern Life''===
Hillenburg's first professional job in the animation business was as a [[animation director|director]]&lt;ref name="Makin' Toons"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Origin of SpongeBob SquarePants" /&gt; on ''[[Rocko's Modern Life]]'' (1993{{ndash}}1996),&lt;ref name="Lenburg, p. 140"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Makin' Toons"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Banks, p. 9"/&gt; [[Nickelodeon]]'s first in-house cartoon production.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Neuwirth|2003|pp=252–253}}&lt;/ref&gt; He "ended up finding work in the industry and got a job" at the television network after he met the show's creator, [[Joe Murray (animator)|Joe Murray]],&lt;ref name="PGF News"/&gt; at the 1992 Ottawa International Animation Festival,&lt;ref name="WP Interview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Makin' Toons"/&gt; where ''Wormholes'' and Murray's ''My Dog Zero'' were both in competition.&lt;ref name=OIAF/&gt; Murray, who was looking for people to direct ''Rocko's Modern Life'' at the time,&lt;ref name="Makin' Toons"/&gt; saw Hillenburg's film and offered him a directorial role on the television series.&lt;ref name="Big Pop Fun"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Makin' Toons"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Origin of SpongeBob SquarePants" /&gt; He "[had] friends that [gave him] a hard time about [the offer]. ... but doors opened when [he] stepped into the animation world," so he accepted it.&lt;ref name="Makin' Toons"/&gt; He "was planning on being a [[starving artist]]": "[I spent] several thousand dollars to make a film and [realized] I may not make it back{{mdash}}I had loans out. Fortunately, Joe Murray saw my film{{nbsp}}.. and he took a huge chance," Hillenburg related.&lt;ref name="WP Interview"/&gt;

Hillenburg worked closely with Murray&lt;ref name="Abbey, p. 124"&gt;{{harvnb|Abbey|2004|p=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; on ''Rocko's Modern Life'' for its whole run on the air.&lt;ref name="Current Biography"/&gt; Aside from directing, he also produced, wrote for some episodes, and served as the executive story editor.&lt;ref name="Lenburg, p. 140"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Current Biography"/&gt; In 1995,&lt;ref name="Current Biography"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Abbey, p. 124"/&gt; during the show's fourth and final season,&lt;ref name="For young viewers"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shattuck|first1=Kathryn|title=For Young Viewers; For This Scientist, Children Are Like, er, Sponges|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/29/tv/for-young-viewers-for-this-scientist-children-are-like-er-sponges.html|work=The New York Times|accessdate=January 22, 2017|date=July 29, 2001|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202014215/http://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/29/tv/for-young-viewers-for-this-scientist-children-are-like-er-sponges.html|archivedate=February 2, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was promoted to [[creative director]], where he helped oversee pre- and post-production.&lt;ref name="Lenburg, p. 140"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Current Biography"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Abbey, p. 124"/&gt; Working on the series enabled him to repay his loans.&lt;ref name="PGF Interview"/&gt; He later related that he "learned a great deal about writing and producing animation for TV" from his stint on ''Rocko's Modern Life''.&lt;ref name="harvard"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2004/11/19/sponge-creator-talks-bob-whats-the/?print=1|title='Sponge' Creator Talks Bob|accessdate=July 19, 2011|last=Moss|first=Alexandra B.|work=The Harvard Crimson|date=November 19, 2004|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121007150523/http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2004/11/19/sponge-creator-talks-bob-whats-the/?print=1|archivedate=October 7, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''SpongeBob SquarePants''===
{{Main article|SpongeBob SquarePants}}

====Creation====
Some evidence shows that the idea for ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' dates back to 1986, during Hillenburg's time at the Orange County Marine Institute.&lt;ref name="HeintjesHA"/&gt; He indicated that [[children's television series]] such as ''[[Mighty Mouse: The New Adventures|The New Adventures of Mighty Mouse]]'' (1987{{ndash}}1988) and ''[[Pee-wee's Playhouse]]'' (1986{{ndash}}1991) "sparked something in [him]." He continued, "I don't know if this is true for everybody else, but it always seems like, for me, I'll start thinking about something and it takes about ten years to actually have it happen, or have someone else believe in it... It took me a few years to get [''SpongeBob SquarePants''] together."&lt;ref name="Makin' Toons"/&gt;

During the production of ''Rocko's Modern Life'', [[Martin Olson]], one of the writers, read ''The Intertidal Zone'' and encouraged Hillenburg to create a television series with a similar concept. At that point, he had not even considered creating his own series:&lt;ref name="Big Pop Fun"/&gt; "After watching Joe [Murray] tear his hair out a lot, dealing with all the problems that came up, I thought I would never want to produce a show of my own."&lt;ref name="Abbey, p. 124"/&gt; However, he realized that if he ever did, this would be the best approach:&lt;ref name="Big Pop Fun"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Origin of SpongeBob SquarePants"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Banks, p. 10"&gt;{{harvnb|Banks|2004|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; "For all those years it seemed like I was doing these two totally separate things. I wondered what it all meant. I didn't see a synthesis. It was great when [my two interests] all came together in [a show]. I felt relieved that I hadn't wasted a lot of time doing something that I then abandoned to do something else. It has been pretty rewarding," Hillenburg said in 2002.&lt;ref name="Current Biography"/&gt; He claimed that he finally decided to create a series as he was driving to the beach on the [[Interstate 10 in California#Santa Monica Freeway|Santa Monica Freeway]] one day.&lt;ref name="Abbey, p. 124"/&gt;

As he was developing the show's concept, Hillenburg remembered his teaching experience at the Orange County Marine Institute and how mesmerized children were by tide-pool animals, including [[crab]]s, [[octopus]]es, [[starfish]], and [[sponge]]s.&lt;ref name="Lenburg, p. 140"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Current Biography"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Abbey, p. 124"/&gt; It came to him that the series should take place underwater, with a focus on those creatures: "I wanted to create a small town underwater where the characters were more like us than like fish. They have fire. They take walks. They drive. They have pets and holidays."&lt;ref name="Abbey, p. 124"/&gt; It suited what Hillenburg liked for a show, "something that was fantastic but believable."&lt;ref name="Abbey, p. 124"/&gt; He also wanted his series to stand out from most popular cartoons of the time exemplified by [[Buddy film|buddy comedies]] such as ''[[The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show]]'' (1991{{ndash}}1995). As a result, he decided to focus on one main character: the weirdest sea creature that he could think of. This led him to the sponge:&lt;ref name="Big Pop Fun"/&gt; "I wanted to do a show about a character that was an innocent, and so I focused on a sea sponge because it's a funny animal, a strange one."&lt;ref name="For young viewers"/&gt; In 1994,&lt;ref name="WalkervViacom"/&gt; Hillenburg began to further develop some characters from ''The Intertidal Zone'',&lt;ref name="Big Pop Fun"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WalkervViacom"/&gt; including Bob the Sponge.&lt;ref name="Big Pop Fun"/&gt;

Bob the Sponge is the comic's "announcer".&lt;ref name="Big Pop Fun"/&gt; He resembles an actual sea sponge, and at first Hillenburg continued this design&lt;ref name="Big Pop Fun"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Makin' Toons"&gt;{{harvnb|Neuwirth|2003|pp=50–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Origin of SpongeBob SquarePants"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Banks, p.31"&gt;{{harvnb|Banks|2004|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; because it "was the correct thing to do biologically as a marine-science teacher."&lt;ref name="Abbey, p. 124"/&gt; In determining the new character's personality, he drew inspiration from innocent, childlike figures that he enjoyed, such as [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[Laurel and Hardy]], [[Jerry Lewis]], and [[Pee-wee Herman]].&lt;ref name="HeintjesHA"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heintjes|first=Tom|url=http://cartoonician.com/the-oral-history-of-spongebob-squarepants/|title=The Oral History of SpongeBob SquarePants|magazine=Hogan's Alley|issue=17|publisher=Bull Moose Publishing|accessdate=August 28, 2015|date=September 21, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150831044034/http://cartoonician.com/the-oral-history-of-spongebob-squarepants/|archivedate=August 31, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Big Pop Fun"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Makin' Toons"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Banks pg. 30"&gt;{{harvnb|Banks|2004|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then considered modeling the character after a [[Sponge (material)|kitchen sponge]], and realized that this idea would match the character's square personality perfectly:&lt;ref name="Big Pop Fun"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Makin' Toons"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Origin of SpongeBob SquarePants"/&gt; "[I]t looked so funny.

In 1997, while [[Pitch (filmmaking)|pitching]] the cartoon to executives at Nickelodeon, Hillenburg donned a Hawaiian shirt, brought along an "underwater [[Vivarium|terrarium]] with models of the characters", and played Hawaiian music to set the theme.

Despite its widespread popularity, ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' has been involved in public controversies.

According to his colleagues, Hillenburg is "a perfectionist workaholic".&lt;ref name="Soaking in success"/&gt; He is also known for his private nature. Julia Pistor, co-producer of ''The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie'', noted that Hillenburg is "very shy". She went on to say, "He doesn't want people to know about his life or family. He's just a really funny, down-to-earth guy with a dry sense of humor who puts his family first and keeps us on our toes in keeping our corporate integrity."&lt;ref name="Soaking in success"/&gt; Hillenburg said about himself, "I make animation because I like to draw and create things.

In March 2017, Hillenburg disclosed that he was diagnosed with [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS), a terminal illness that affects and causes the [[Neurodegeneration|death of neurons]] that control the brain and the spinal cord. He released a statement to the ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine after his diagnosis, in which he said that he would continue to work on ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' "for as long as [he is] able."

Cartoonist [[Troy Walker]], in 2007, sued Hillenburg, whom he claimed stole the idea for the SpongeBob SquarePants character from his 1991 [[comic strip]], ''Bob Spongee, the Unemployed Sponge'', and the eponymous homemade doll.&lt;ref name="Gerstman"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gerstman|first=Bruce|title=Fairfield man claims rights to SpongeBob|url=http://www.eastbaytimes.com/2007/03/10/fairfield-man-claims-rights-to-spongebob/|newspaper=East Bay Times|publisher=Digital First Media|accessdate=January 12, 2014|date=March 10, 2007|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160912033541/http://www.eastbaytimes.com/2007/03/10/fairfield-man-claims-rights-to-spongebob/|archivedate=September 12, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ABC"&gt;{{cite news|author=Staff writer(s); no by-line. |title=Man Claims He Created Original SpongeBob |url=http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/entertainment&amp;id=5110744 |agency=Associated Press |via=ABC |accessdate=January 12, 2014 |date=March 10, 2007 |location=San Francisco, California |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140112115628/http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news%2Fentertainment&amp;id=5110744 |archivedate=January 12, 2014 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ContraCostaWalker"&gt;{{cite news|author=Staff writer(s); no by-line.|title=Man Sues for $1.6 Billion Over Rights to Sponge Bob Square Pants|url=http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2007/03/13/77690.htm|newspaper=Contra Costa Times|publisher=Digital First Media|via=''Insurance Journal'', Merchants Insurance Group|date=March 13, 2007|accessdate=January 12, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140112123956/http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2007/03/13/77690.htm|archivedate=January 12, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his original concept, Walker drew a face on a kitchen sponge and attached googly eyes.&lt;ref name="Gerstman"/&gt; He produced approximately 1,000 of the "drawn-on" dolls.&lt;ref name="WalkervViacom"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gerstman"/&gt; Walker then placed those models in clear plastic bags that included the comic strip, and sold them at flea markets in the San Francisco Bay Area in 1992.&lt;ref name="WalkervViacom"/&gt; He also placed an advertisement in the ''[[Oakland Tribune]]'',&lt;ref name="WalkervViacom"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gerstman"/&gt; selling fewer than 20 dolls.&lt;ref name="WalkervViacom"/&gt; After learning about ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' in 2002, Walker concluded, "It obviously fell into the hands of one of the producers of the show. It's a clear pattern of duplication."&lt;ref name="Gerstman"/&gt; He did not register the comic strip with the [[United States Copyright Office|U.S. Copyright Office]] until 2003.&lt;ref name="WalkervViacom"/&gt;

Walker also filed the lawsuit against Nickelodeon, [[Paramount Pictures]] (the [[Film distributor|distributor]] of ''The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie''), and [[Viacom]] (their [[parent company]]) in a [[United States district court|U.S. district court]] in San Francisco. He demanded $1.6 billion in damages, alleging that Hillenburg used his idea without his permission. Walker added in his complaint, "It is more than ironic that two working class sponges are named Bob. Both characters are unemployed. Both characters live in a house concept,"&lt;ref name="Gerstman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ABC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ContraCostaWalker"/&gt; referring to "[[Help Wanted (SpongeBob SquarePants)|Help Wanted]]" (the pilot episode of ''SpongeBob SquarePants'') which, he supposed, "represents an obvious continuum from the last scene of the Bob Spongee comic strip."&lt;ref name="WalkervViacom"/&gt; In a public statement, Viacom said that they believed Walker's claim was "baseless".&lt;ref name="Gerstman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ABC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ContraCostaWalker"/&gt; A settlement conference, filed on May{{nbsp}}13, 2008, was conducted at the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California|Northern District Federal Court]] in San Francisco.
