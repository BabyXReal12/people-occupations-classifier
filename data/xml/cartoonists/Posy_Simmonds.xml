'''Rosemary Elizabeth''' "'''Posy'''" '''Simmonds''' [[MBE]] (born 9 August 1945) is a British newspaper [[cartoonist]] and writer and illustrator of [[Children's literature|children's books]]. She is best known for her long association with ''[[The Guardian]]'', for which she has drawn the series ''[[Gemma Bovery]]'' (2000) and ''[[Tamara Drewe]]'' (2005–06), both later published as books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paulgravett.com/index.php/articles/article/posy_simmonds/|title=Paul Gravett interviewing Posy Simmonds|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her style gently satirises the [[Social structure of Britain#20th century|English middle classes]] and in particular those of a literary bent. Both of the published books feature a "doomed heroine", much in the style of the 18th- and 19th-century [[Gothic novel|gothic romantic novel]], to which they often allude, but with an ironic, modernist slant.

==Career==
Posy Simmonds was born in [[Berkshire]] and educated at [[Queen Anne's School]], [[Caversham, Berkshire|Caversham]]. She studied at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] before returning to London to attend [[Central School of Art &amp; Design]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/2045620.stm |title=BBC News, June 2002 |publisher=BBC News |date=14 June 2002 |accessdate=5 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; She started her newspaper career drawing a daily cartoon, "Bear", for ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' in 1969. She contributed humorous illustrations to ''[[The Times]]'' from 1968 to 1970. She also contributed to ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'', and a satirical cartoon to [[Tariq Ali]]'s ''[[The Black Dwarf (newspaper)|Black Dwarf]]'' magazine. She moved to ''The Guardian'' as an illustrator in 1972.

In May 1977 she started drawing a weekly comic strip for ''The Guardian'', initially titled ''The Silent Three of St Botolph's'' as a tribute to the 1950s strip ''[[The Silent Three]]'' by [[Evelyn Flinders]]. It began as a silly parody of girls' adventure stories making satirical comments about contemporary life. The strip soon focused on three 1950s schoolfriends in their later, middle-class and nearly middle-aged lives: Wendy Weber, a former nurse married to [[polytechnic (United Kingdom)|polytechnic]] sociology lecturer George with a large brood of children; Jo Heep, married to whisky salesman Edmund with two rebellious teenagers; and Trish Wright, married to philandering advertising executive Stanhope and with a young baby. The strip, which was latterly untitled and usually known just as "Posy", ran until the late 1980s. It was collected into a number of books: ''Mrs Weber's Diary'', ''Pick of Posy'', ''Very Posy'' and ''Pure Posy'', and one original book featuring the same characters, ''True Love''. Her later cartoons for ''The Guardian'' and ''[[The Spectator]]'' were collected as ''Mustn't Grumble'' in 1993.

In 1981, Simmonds was named Cartoonist of the Year&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/2045620.stm |title=Simmonds's satirical touch |publisher=BBC News |date=14 June 2002 |accessdate=5 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[British Press Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pressawards.org.uk/page-view.php?pagename=1980-1989-Winners|title=Press Awards Winners 1980 - 1989|accessdate=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982 and 1983 she contributed a regular full-page strip to ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'' in America. In 1987 Simmonds turned her hand to writing, as well as illustrating, children's books. ''Fred'', the story of a cat with a secret life, was later filmed as ''Famous Fred'' and nominated for the [[Academy Award for Animated Short Film]] and several [[BAFTA]]s. Her other children's books include ''Lulu and the Flying Babies'', ''The Chocolate Wedding'' and ''Lavender''.

In the late 1990s Posy returned to the pages of ''The Guardian'' with ''[[Gemma Bovery]]'', which reworked the story of [[Gustave Flaubert]]'s ''[[Madame Bovary]]'' into a satirical tale of English expatriates in France. It was published as a graphic novel in 1999 and was made into a feature film, directed by [[Anne Fontaine]] in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Posy Simmonds lecture|url=https://thefalmouthschoolofart.wordpress.com/2015/03/02/posy-simmonds-lecture-wednesday-4-march-5pm/|date=2 March 2015|author=The Falmouth School of Art|accessdate=10 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Literary Life'' appeared in ''The Guardian'''s "Review" section on Saturdays from November 2002 until December 2004. One collected edition of ''Literary Life'' cartoons has been published.

Posy's 2005-6 ''Guardian'' series, ''[[Tamara Drewe]]'', made its début in the Review section on 17 September 2005, in the first Saturday paper after the ''Guardian'''s relaunch in the [[Berliner (format)|Berliner format]]. It ended, with episode 109 and an epilogue, on 2 December 2006 and was published as a book in 2007. In 2010 the story was adapted as a [[Tamara Drewe (film)|feature film of the same name]], directed by [[Stephen Frears]] from a screenplay by [[Moira Buffini]], starring [[Gemma Arterton]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotsman.com/news/interview-posy-simmonds-cartoonist-1-477855 "Interview: Posy Simmonds, cartoonist"], ''The Scotsman'', 4 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

She drew the illustrations for the opening titles of the [[BBC]]'s 2007 production of [[Elizabeth Gaskell]]'s ''[[Cranford (2007 TV series)|Cranford]]'', and for ''Midsummer Nights'', a volume of opera-related short stories by prominent writers published in 2009 to mark the 75th anniversary of the [[Glyndebourne Festival Opera|Glyndebourne Opera Festival]]. She was made a [[Member of the Order of the British Empire]] in 2002 for services to the newspaper industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/2045620.stm "Simmonds's satirical touch"], ''BBC News'', 14 June 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; After being nominated already in 2001 for ''Gemma Bovery'', Simmonds won the 2009 [[Prix de la critique]] of the French [[Association des Critiques et des journalistes de Bande Dessinée|Association of comics critics and journalists]] for ''Tamara Drewe''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acbd.fr/laureat-2009.html |title=Lauréat 2009 |accessdate=19 March 2009 |date=December 2008 |publisher=[[Association des Critiques et des journalistes de Bande Dessinée|ACBD]] |language=French |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090622155751/http://www.acbd.fr/laureat-2009.html |archivedate=22 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
