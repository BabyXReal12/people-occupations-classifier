{{Anime and manga}}
{{nihongo |'''Osamu Tezuka'''|手塚 治虫, {{lang|en|born}} 手塚 治|Tezuka Osamu | {{birth date|1928|11|3|df = y}} – 9 February 1989|lead=yes}} was a Japanese [[manga artist]], [[cartoonist]], [[animator]], and [[film producer]]. Born in [[Osaka Prefecture]], his prolific output, pioneering techniques, and innovative redefinitions of genres earned him such titles as "the father of [[manga]]", "the godfather of manga" and "the god of manga." Additionally, he is often considered the Japanese equivalent to [[Walt Disney]], who served as a major inspiration during Tezuka's formative years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Tezuka Osamu Monogatari | year = 1992 | publisher = Tezuka Productions}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tezuka began what was known as the manga revolution in Japan with his ''[[Shin Takarajima|New Treasure Island]]'' published in 1947. His legendary output would spawn some of the most influential, successful, and well received manga series including ''[[Astro Boy]]'', ''[[Kimba the White Lion]]'', ''[[Black Jack (manga)|Black Jack]]'', and ''[[Phoenix (manga)|Phoenix]]'', all of which won several awards.

Tezuka died of [[stomach cancer]] in 1989. His death had an immediate impact on the Japanese public and other cartoonists. A museum was constructed in [[Takarazuka, Hyōgo|Takarazuka]] dedicated to his memory and life works, and Tezuka received many posthumous awards. Several animations were in production at the time of his death along with the final chapters of ''Phoenix,'' which were never released.

==Biography==
===Early life (1928–1945)===
Tezuka was the eldest of three children in [[Toyonaka, Osaka|Toyonaka City]], [[Osaka Prefecture|Osaka]].{{Sfn | Patten | 2004 | p = 145}}&lt;ref name="Otaku Encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite book | last = Galbraith | first=Patrick W.|title=[[The Otaku Encyclopedia: An Insider's Guide to the Subculture of Cool Japan]] |publisher = Kodansha International|year=2009|pages=220–21|isbn = 978-4-7700-3101-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; His nickname was ''gashagasha-atama'' (''gashagasha'' is slang for messy, ''atama'' means head). Later in life, he gave his mother credit for inspiring confidence and creativity through her stories. She frequently took him to the [[Takarazuka Grand Theater|Takarazuka Theatre]], which often headlined the [[Takarazuka Revue]], an all-female musical theater troupe. Their romantic musicals aimed at a female audience, had a large influence of Tezuka's later works, including his costume designs. Not only that, but the large, sparkling eyes also had an influence on Tezuka's art style.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legacy.com/news/celebrity-deaths/article/osamu-tezuka-god-of-manga] {{dead link|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has said that he has a profound "spirit of nostalgia" for Takarazuka.&lt;ref name="Gravett p.77"&gt;{{cite book| last =Gravett | first = Paul|authorlink=Paul Gravett|year=2004|title= [[Manga: 60 Years of Japanese Comics]]|publisher=Harper Design|isbn = 1-85669-391-0 | page= 77}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Tezuka was young, his father showed him Disney films; he became obsessed with the films and began to replicate them. He also became a Disney movie buff, seeing the films multiple times in a row, most famously seeing [[Bambi]] more than 80 times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2007/08/19/books/book-reviews/osamu-tezuka-fighting-for-peace-with-the-mighty-atom/#.WeJp3VtSy2w|title=Osamu Tezuka: Fighting for peace with the Mighty Atom|date= August 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tezuka started to draw comics around his second year of elementary school, drawing so much that his mother would have to erase pages in his notebook in order to keep up with his output. Tezuka was also inspired by works by Tagawa Hosui and Umino Junzo.&lt;ref name="tezukaosamu.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tezukaosamu.net/en/about/1930.html|title=1930s：History：ABOUT TEZUKA OSAMU：TezukaOsamu.net(EN)|website=Tezukaosamu.net|accessdate=22 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around his fifth year he found a bug named "[[Ground beetle|Osamushi]]". It so resembled his name that he adopted "Osamushi" as his pen name.&lt;ref name="tezukaosamu.net"/&gt; He continued to develop his manga skills throughout his school career. During this period he created his first adept amateur works.&lt;ref name="tezukaosamu.net"/&gt; During high school in 1944, Tezuka was drafted to work for a factory, supporting the Japanese war effort during [[World War II]]; he simultaneously continued writing manga. In 1945, Tezuka was accepted into [[Osaka University]] and began studying medicine. During this time, he also began publishing his first professional works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tezukaosamu.net/en/about/1940.html|title=1940s：History：ABOUT TEZUKA OSAMU：TezukaOsamu.net(EN)|website=Tezukaosamu.net|accessdate=22 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Publishing career and early success (1946–1952)===
[[File:Tezuka_Osamu.JPG|230px|thumb|right|thumbtime=2|Tezuka in 1952]]
Tezuka came to the realization that he could use manga as a means of helping to convince people to care for the world. After World War II, at age 17, he published his first piece of work: ''[[Diary of Ma-chan]]''. Tezuka began talks with fellow manga artist Shichima Sakai, who had pitched Tezuka a manga based around the famous story ''[[Treasure Island]]''. Sakai promised Tezuka a publishing spot from [[Ikuei Shuppan]] if he would work on the manga. Tezuka finished the manga, only loosely basing it on the original work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcj.com/tezuka-osamu-outwits-the-phantom-blot-the-case-of-new-treasure-island-contd/2/|title=Tezuka Osamu Outwits the Phantom Blot: The Case of New Treasure Island cont’d - The Comics Journal - Page 2|website=Tcj.com|accessdate=22 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Shin Takarajima]]'' (''New Treasure Island'') was published and became an overnight success which began the golden age of manga, a craze comparable to [[American comic book]]s at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/article4723984.ece | work=The Times | location=London | title= Osamu Tezuka the master of mighty manga | first=Dominic | last=Wells | date = 2008-09-13 | accessdate= 2010-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951, Tezuka joined a group known as Tokyo Children Manga Association consisting of other manga artists such as Baba Noboru, Ota Jiro, Furusawa Hideo, Fukui Eiichi, Irie Shigeru, and Negishi Komichi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tezukaosamu.net/en/about/1950.html|title=1950s：History：ABOUT TEZUKA OSAMU：TezukaOsamu.net(EN)|website=Tezukaosamu.net|accessdate=22 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the success of ''New Treasure Island,'' Tezuka traveled to [[Tokyo]] in search of a publisher for more of his work. After visiting [[Kobunsha]] Tezuka was turned down. However, publisher [[Shinseikaku]] agreed to purchase ''The Strange Voyage of Dr. Tiger'' and [[Domei Shuppansha]] would purchase ''The Mysterious Dr. Koronko''. Whilst continuing his study in medical school Tezuka published his first masterpieces: a trilogy of science fiction epics called ''[[Lost World (manga)|Lost World]]'', ''[[Metropolis (manga)|Metropolis]]'' and ''[[Next World (manga)|Next World]]''.

Soon after Tezuka published his first major success ''Jungle Emperor Leo'', it was serialized in ''[[Manga Shonen]]'' from 1950 to 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tezukaosamu.net/en/manga/186.html|title=Jungle Emperor Leo : Manga : TezukaOsamu.net(EN)|website=Tezukaosamu.net|accessdate=22 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951 Tezuka graduated from the Osaka School of Medicine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tezukaosamu.net/en/about/1950.html|title=1950s：History：ABOUT TEZUKA OSAMU：TezukaOsamu.net(EN)|website=Tezukaosamu.net|accessdate=22 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and published ''[[Ambassador Atom]]'', the first appearance of the Astro Boy character.

===''Astro Boy'', national fame and early animation (1952–1960)===

[[File:Astro Boy-08.jpg|150px|thumb|left|thumbtime=2|''Tetsuwan Atom'' Cover Volume No. 8]]
By 1952, Ambassador Atom proved to be only a mild success in Japan; however, one particular character became extremely popular with young boys: a humanoid robot named Atom.{{Sfn | Schodt | 2007 | p =4}} Tezuka received several letters from many young boys.{{Sfn | Schodt | 2007 | p=20}}Expecting success with a series based around Atom, Tezuka's producer suggested that he be given human emotions.{{Sfn | Schodt | 2007 | p=21}} One day while working at a hospital Tezuka was punched in the face by a frustrated American G.I. This encounter gave Tezuka the idea to create Atom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apjjf.org/-Yuki-Tanaka/3412/article.html|title=War and Peace in the Art of Tezuka Osamu: The humanism of his epic manga−− - The Asia-Pacific Journal: Japan Focus|website=Apjjf.org|accessdate=22 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 4, 1952, ''Tetsuwan Atom'' began serialization in ''Weekly Shonen Magazine''. The character Atom and his adventures became an instant phenomenon in Japan.

Due to the success of ''Tetsuwan Atom'', in 1953 Tezuka published the first [[Shōjo manga|shōjo]] manga ''[[Ribon no Kishi]]'' (''Princess Knight''), serialized in ''[[Shojo Club]]'' from 1953 to 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tezukaosamu.net/en/manga/559.html|title=Princess Knight [Shojo Club &lt;Girl's Comic&gt;] : Manga : TezukaOsamu.net(EN)|website=Tezukaosamu.net|accessdate=22 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954 Tezuka first published what he would consider his life's work, ''Phoenix'', which originally appeared in ''Mushi Production Commercial Firm''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tezukaosamu.net/en/manga/403.html|title=The Phoenix (Chapter of Dawn)[COM Magazine] : Manga : TezukaOsamu.net(EN)|website=Tezukaosamu.net|accessdate=22 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958 Tezuka was asked by [[Toei Animation]] if his manga ''[[Son-Goku The Monkey]]'' could be adapted into an animation. It was widely reported that Tezuka worked as a director on the film, though Tezuka himself denied working on it.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} He was only involved in its promotion, which later sparked his interest in the animation industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.awn.com/mag/issue1.5/articles/patten1.5.html|title=A Capsule History of Anime|website=Awn.com|accessdate=22 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was released as ''[[Alakazam the Great]]'' in 1960.

===Production Career (1961-1989)===
In 1961, Tezuka entered the animation industry in Japan by founding the production company [[Mushi Productions]] as a rivalry with Toei Animation. He first began innovating the industry with the broadcast of the animated version of ''[[Astro Boy (1963 TV series)|Astro Boy]]'' in 1963; this series would create the first successful model for animation production in Japan and would also be the first Japanese animation dubbed into English for an American audience. Other series were subsequently translated to animation, including ''Jungle Emperor'', the first Japanese animated series produced in full color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/6233/kimba-boxed-set/|title=Kimba Boxed Set|website=DVD Talk|accessdate=22 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967, in response to the magazine Garo and the [[gekiga]], Tezuka created the magazine [[COM (manga magazine)|COM]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://neuviemeart.citebd.org/spip.php?article239|title=garo, magazine rebelle|website=Neuviemeart.citebd.org|accessdate=22 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tezuka stepped down as acting director in 1968 to found a new animation studio, [[Tezuka Productions]], and continued experimenting with animation late into his life. In 1973, Mushi Productions collapsed financially and the fallout would produce several influential animation production studios including [[Sunrise (company)|Sunrise]].

=== Death and legacy ===
Tezuka died of [[stomach cancer]] on 9 February 1989 in Tokyo.&lt;ref name="Patten2004"&gt;{{Harvnb | Patten | 2004 | p = 198}}&lt;/ref&gt; His last words were: "I'm begging you, let me work!", spoken to a nurse who had tried to take away his drawing equipment.&lt;ref name="hinotori"&gt;Takayuki Matsutani (date unknown). [[Viz Media]]'s English language release of the ''Hi no Tori'' manga. In an afterword written by Takayuki Matsutani, president of Mushi Productions.&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of [[Takarazuka, Hyōgo]], where Tezuka grew up, opened a museum in his memory.&lt;ref name="Otaku Encyclopedia" /&gt; Stamps were issued in his honor in 1997. Also, beginning in 2003, the Japanese toy company [[Kaiyodo]] began manufacturing a series of figurines of Tezuka's creations, including Princess Knight, Unico, the Phoenix, Dororo, Marvelous Melmo, Ambassador Magma, and many others. To date, three series of the figurines have been released.

His legacy has continued to be honored among manga artists and animators. Artists such as [[Akira Toriyama]] (''[[Dr. Slump]]'' and ''[[Dragon Ball]]'')&lt;ref name="SJ interview"&gt;{{cite web |title=''Shonen Jump'' interview |url=http://www.myfavoritegames.com/dragonball-z/Info/Interviews/Interviews-AkiraToriyama.htm |work= My favorite games | accessdate =2013-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; have cited Tezuka as inspiration for their works.

From 2003 to 2009, [[Naoki Urasawa]] and Takashi Nagasaki adapted an arc of ''Astro Boy'' into the murder mystery series ''[[Pluto (manga)|Pluto]]''.&lt;ref name="Pluto"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/house-of-1000-manga/2012-09-13 | work = Jason Thompson's House of 1000 Manga | title = Pluto|date = 2012-09-13 | publisher = [[Anime News Network]]|accessdate = 2014-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tezuka was a personal friend (and apparent artistic influence) of Brazilian comic book artist [[Mauricio de Sousa]]. In 2012, Maurício published a two-issue story arc in the ''[[Monica Teen]]'' comic book featuring some of Tezuka's main characters, such as Astro Boy, Black Jack, Sapphire, and Kimba, joining Monica and her friends in an adventure in the [[Amazon rainforest]] against a smuggling organization chopping down hundreds of trees. This was the first time that [[Tezuka Productions]] has allowed overseas artists to use Tezuka's characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Ari | last = Hirayama | url = http://ajw.asahi.com/article/cool_japan/AJ201202010008 | title = Brazilian cartoonist to publish manga with Osamu Tezuka | work = [[Asahi Shimbun]] | date = February 1, 2012 | accessdate = February 28, 2012 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130729085553/http://ajw.asahi.com/article/cool_japan/AJ201202010008 | archivedate = July 29, 2013 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Tezuka is a descendent of [[Hattori Hanzō]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution-url = http://tezukaosamu.net/en/museum/permanent_1.html | publisher = Tezuka | title = Osamu Permanent Exhibition | contribution = Birth | accessdate = 2011-10-18}}.&lt;/ref&gt; a famous ninja and samurai who faithfully served [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] during the [[Sengoku period]] in Japan. His son [[Makoto Tezuka]] became a film and anime director.&lt;ref name="Osamu Tezuka Biography"&gt;{{IMDb name |856804| section =bio}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tezuka guided many well-known manga artists such as [[Shotaro Ishinomori]] and [[Go Nagai]].

Tezuka enjoyed bug-collecting, entomology, Walt Disney, baseball, and licensed the "grown up" version of his character Kimba the White Lion as the logo for the [[Seibu Lions]] of the [[Nippon Professional Baseball|Nippon Professional Baseball League]].&lt;ref name="Osamu Tezuka Biography" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution-url = http://jhockey.wordpress.com/2008/10/18/the-four-lions-asia-series/ | title = Japan, Hockey, Baseball, &amp;c | contribution = The Four Lions of Asia | accessdate = 2011-09-22}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Tezuka met Walt Disney in person at the [[1964 New York World's Fair]]. In a 1986 entry in his personal diary, Tezuka stated that Disney wanted to hire him for a potential science fiction project. Tezuka was a fan of [[Superman]] and was made honorary chairman of the Superman Fan Club in Japan.&lt;ref name="About Osamu Tezuka"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tezukaosamu.net/en/about/1980.html|title=About Tezuka Osamu|work=www.tezukaosamu.net|accessdate=2015-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959 Tezuka married Etsuko Okada at a Takarazuka Hotel.

As a child, Tezuka's arms swelled up and he became ill. He was treated and cured by a doctor, which made him want to be a doctor. At a crossing point, he asked his mother whether he should look into doing manga full-time or whether he should become a doctor. At the time, being a manga author was not a particularly rewarding job. The answer his mother gave was: "You should work doing the thing you like most of all." Tezuka decided to devote himself to manga creation on a full-time basis. He graduated from Osaka University and obtained his medical degree, but he would later use his medical and scientific knowledge to enrich his sci-fi manga, such as ''[[Black Jack (manga)|Black Jack]]''.&lt;ref name="TezukaStory" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hanabatake"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hanabatake.com/research/tezuka.htm#_ednref11|title=Tezuka: God of Comics|last=Santiago|first=Ardith|publisher=Hanabatake|accessdate=2007-07-18|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070716014936/http://www.hanabatake.com/research/tezuka.htm#_ednref11|archivedate=2007-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tezuka was [[agnostic]], and was buried in a Buddhist cemetery in Tokyo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Astro Boy Essays: Osamu Tezuka, Mighty Atom, and the Manga/Anime Revolution|year=2007|publisher = Stone Bridge Press |isbn= 978-1-93333054-9| page= 141| first = Frederik L | last = Schodt| quote= His family was associated with a Zen Buddhist sect, and Tezuka is buried in a Tokyo Buddhist cemetery, but his views on religion were actually quite agnostic and as flexible as his views on politics.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
His complete oeuvre includes over 700 volumes with more than 150,000 pages.&lt;ref name = "Wired"&gt;{{cite web | last = Katayama | first = Lisa | title =Museum Show Spotlights Artistry of Manga God Osamu Tezuka | work =[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] | date = 2007-05-31 | url = https://www.wired.com/culture/culturereviews/news/2007/05/astroboy | accessdate = 2007-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TezukaStory"&gt;{{cite web | title = The Story of Tezuka, Osamu | publisher = Tezuka Osamu @ World | url = http://en-f.tezuka.co.jp/osamu/story/ | accessdate = 2007-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; A complete list of his works can be found on the Tezuka Osamu Manga Museum website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tezukaosamu.net/en/manga/index.html|title=Manga : TezukaOsamu.net(EN)|website=Tezukaosamu.net|access-date=2016-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tezuka's creations include ''[[Astro Boy]]'' (''Mighty Atom'' in Japan), ''[[Black Jack (manga)|Black Jack]]'', ''[[Princess Knight]]'', ''[[Phoenix (manga)|Phoenix]]'' (''Hi no Tori'' in Japan), ''[[Kimba the White Lion]]'' (''Jungle Emperor'' in Japan), ''[[Unico]]'', ''[[Message to Adolf]]'', ''[[The Amazing 3]]'' and ''[[Buddha (manga)|Buddha]]''. His "life's work" was ''[[Phoenix (manga)|Phoenix]]''—a story of life and death that he began in the 1950s and continued until his death.{{Sfn | Patten | 2004 | p = 199}}

In January 1965, Tezuka received a letter from American film director [[Stanley Kubrick]], who had watched ''[[Astro Boy]]'' and wanted to invite Tezuka to be the art director of his next movie, ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' (1968). Although flattered by Kubrick's invitation, Tezuka could not afford to leave his studio for a year to live in England, so he had to turn it down. Although he could not work on it, he loved the film, and would play its soundtrack at maximum volume in his studio to keep him awake during long nights of work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Osamu Star Annals: 1960s | work =Tezuka Osamu @ World | publisher = Tezuka Productions | url = http://en.tezuka.co.jp/osamu/annals/1960.html | accessdate = 2007-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Tezuka Osamu | publisher = Japan Zone | url = http://www.japan-zone.com/modern/tezuka_osamu.shtml | accessdate = 2007-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style==
Tezuka is known for his imaginative stories and stylized Japanese adaptations of western literature. Tezuka's "cinematic" page layouts was influenced by [[Milt Gross]]' early graphic novel ''[[He Done Her Wrong]].'' He read this book as child, and its style characterized many manga artists who followed in Tezuka's footsteps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = A Yiddishe Manga: The Creative Roots of Japan's God of Comics | publisher = Wix | work = Innovative Research in Japanese Studies | url = http://media.wix.com/ugd/aa7d16_761fb1e8c44a48a6b42f22e3bb8d1b23.pdf | format = [[Portable document format|PDF]] | accessdate = 2014-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work, like that of other manga creators, was sometimes gritty and violent.

Tezuka headed the animation production studio [[Mushi Production]] ("Bug Production"), which pioneered TV animation in Japan.&lt;ref name = foster&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.clas.ufl.edu/users/jmurphy/JPT3500file/JPT.Projectfile/Jpt/Mickey.html |title=Osamu Tezuka, Animation Pioneer |accessdate=2008-02-08 |last= Foster |first = Melanie | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071024152609/http://www.clas.ufl.edu/users/jmurphy/JPT3500file/JPT.Projectfile/Jpt/Mickey.html  |archivedate = 2007-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He invented the distinctive "large eyes" style of [[anime|Japanese animation]],{{Sfn | Patten | 2004 | p = 144}} drawing inspiration from Western cartoons and animated films of the time such as ''[[Betty Boop]]'', ''[[Mickey Mouse]],'' and other [[Walt Disney|Disney]] movies.

==Museum==
[[File:Osamu Tezuka Museum.jpg|thumb|left|The Osamu Tezuka Manga Museum]]
{{nihongo|The Osamu Tezuka Manga Museum|宝塚市立手塚治虫記念館||lit. "Takarazuka City Tezuka Osamu Memorial Hall"}}, located in the city of [[Takarazuka, Hyōgo]] Prefecture, was inaugurated on April 25, 1994, and has three floors (15069.47&amp;nbsp;ft²). In the basement there is an "Animation Workshop" in which visitors can make their own animation, and a mockup of the city of Takarazuka and a replica of the table where Osamu Tezuka worked.

Outside of the building's entrance, there are imitations of the hands and feet of several characters from Tezuka (as in a true walk of fame) and on the inside, the entry hall, a replica of [[Princess Knight]]'s furniture. On the same floor is a permanent exhibition of manga and a room for the display of anime. The exhibition is divided into two parts: Osamu Tezuka and the city of Takarazuka and Osamu Tezuka, the author.

The second floor contains, along with several exhibitions, a manga library with five hundred works of Tezuka (some foreign editions are also present), a video library, and a lounge with decor inspired by ''Kimba the White Lion''.

There is also a glass sculpture that represents the planet Earth and is based on a book written by Tezuka in his childhood called "Our Earth of Glass."
