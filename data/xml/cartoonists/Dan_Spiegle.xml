'''Dan Spiegle''' (December 10, 1920  &amp;ndash; January 28, 2017) was an American [[comics artist]] and [[cartoonist]] best known for comics based on movie and television characters across a variety of companies including [[Dell Comics]], [[DC Comics]], and [[Marvel Comics]].

==Biography==

===Early life and career===
Dan Spiegle was born in [[Cosmopolis, Washington]] in 1920,&lt;ref&gt;Spiegle, in {{cite book|first=John|last= Coates|title= Dan Spiegle: A Life In Comic Art|year= 2013|location= Raleigh, North Carolina|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|page= 13|isbn = 978-1605490496}} [[John Jackson Miller|Miller, John Jackson]], lists December 10 in {{cite web |url=http://cbgxtra.com/knowledge-base/for-your-reference/comics-industry-birthdays |title=Comics Industry Birthdays |work=[[Comics Buyer's Guide]] |date=June 10, 2005 |location=Iola, Wisconsin |accessdate=December 12, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5trAbNQWw?url=http://cbgxtra.com/knowledge-base/for-your-reference/comics-industry-birthdays |archivedate=October 30, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and raised there and in [[Honolulu]], Hawaii, and northern California.&lt;ref name=graphic /&gt; After high school, Spiegle "found myself in the [[United States Navy|Navy]]", where he worked on the base newspaper and on insignias for airplanes.&lt;ref name=graphic /&gt; Following his discharge in 1946, Spiegle enrolled at the [[Chouinard Art Institute]] of Los Angeles on the [[G.I. Bill]].&lt;ref name=graphic /&gt;

Spiegle began his professional cartoonist career in 1949 drawing the [[comic strip]] ''[[Hopalong Cassidy]]''&lt;ref name="Lambiek"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.lambiek.net/artists/s/spiegle_d.htm|title= Dan Spiegle|date= July 7, 2013|publisher= [[Lambiek|Lambiek Comiclopedia]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160304105950/https://www.lambiek.net/artists/s/spiegle_d.htm|archivedate= March 4, 2016|deadurl= no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the [[Times Mirror Company|Mirror Enterprises Syndicate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= Hoffmann|first1= Frank|last2= Ramirez|first2= Beulah B.|title= Arts and Entertainment Fads (Encyclopedia of Fads, Volume I)|publisher= [[Routledge]]|date= 1990|location= Abingdon-on-Thames, United Kingdom|pages= 149–150|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=_tR1owszUR0C&amp;pg=PA149|isbn= 978-0866568814}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to draw this strip after it was bought out by [[King Features]] in 1951, until it was canceled in 1955.&lt;ref name="Lambiek" /&gt;

===Dell and Gold Key Comics===
His earliest confirmed work in [[comic books]] is [[penciler|penciling]] and [[inker|inking]] a one-page advertisement for [[Wheaties]] cereal, "Preacher Roe Sparks in Pitching Duel", in ''[[Walt Disney's Comics and Stories]]'' #144 ([[cover-date]]d Sept. 1952).&lt;ref name=gcd&gt;[http://www.comics.org/credit/name/Dan%20Spiegle/sort/chrono/ Dan Spiegle] at the [[Grand Comics Database]].&lt;/ref&gt; His first story in the medium was the 16-page [[Annie Oakley]] [[Western (genre)|Western]] story "The Bushwacker", by an unknown writer, in [[Dell Comics]]' ''Annie Oakley and Tagg'' #7 (June 1956).&lt;ref name=gcd /&gt; Through the remainder of the decade he drew primarily Western stories for such Dell titles as ''[[Four Color]]'', ''[[Rex Allen]]'', ''Queen of the West [[Dale Evans]]'', and others, as well as that publisher's ''Four Color'' feature "[[Spin and Marty]]", based on the segment from the [[The Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney]] TV program ''[[The Mickey Mouse Club]]''. In 1959, he started drawing ''Four Color'' stories for such [[Brand licensing|licensed]] TV series features ''[[Colt .45 (TV series)|Colt .45]]'', ''[[Maverick (TV series)|Maverick]]'', ''[[The Rifleman]]'', ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]'', and ''[[Lawman (TV series)|Lawman]]'', later adding the ''Maverick'' and ''Lawman'' spinoff comic books, among others. He soon expanded to drawing ''Four Color'' features of TV series ranging from ''[[The Untouchables (1959 TV series)|The Untouchables]]'' to ''[[Sea Hunt]]''.&lt;ref name=gcd /&gt;

Spiegle began work on ''Maverick'' comics before any publicity photographs of series star [[James Garner]] were available, so he met the actor on the set and the resultant drawings of Garner in the subsequent comics are eerily exact. In 1972, Spiegle explained in an interview:
{{quote|I would say my favorite was ''Maverick'', which ran about three years — fairly successful, considering the run of other western strips published then. I was assigned this strip even before they had stills available for the show, so I was sent down to Warner Bros. to see it in production — where I met [[James Garner]], which is perhaps the reason I enjoyed it so much. Having met the star, I was extra careful to make the drawings I did look as parallel to the real person as possible. I put my all into that strip, having fun all the way.&lt;ref name=graphic&gt;{{cite news|first= Dan | last = Gheno | url =http://www.dangheno.net/dsinterview.htm | title = An Interview with Dan Spiegle| publisher =  ''Graphic Story World'' via DanGheno.net | year =1972 | archivedate = July 23, 2011 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110723073940/http://www.dangheno.net/dsinterview.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Spiegle continued on these titles as licensor [[Western Publishing Company]] moved away from its business partner Dell to publish comics itself under its [[Gold Key Comics]] imprint. Through the 1960s, Spiegle worked on ''[[Space Family Robinson]]'' which made its debut three years before TV's ''[[Lost in Space]]'', ''[[The Green Hornet (TV series)|The Green Hornet]]'', and ''[[The Invaders]]'', as well as such titles as ''[[Korak, Son of Tarzan]]'', ''[[Brothers of the Spear]]'', and many of Gold Key's mystery/occult titles.&lt;ref name=gcd /&gt; In 1966, at the height of popularity of the [[James Bond]] film series, Spiegle provided naturalistic backgrounds and human characters while [[funny animal]] artist [[Paul Murry]] drew [[Mickey Mouse]] and [[Goofy]] for the short-lived ''Mickey Mouse Super Secret Agent''. As comic book historian [[Scott Shaw (artist)|Scott Shaw]] notes, "What's even weirder about these stories is that in them, none of the 'real' human characters seem to notice anything remotely unusual about occupying space with a three-foot-tall talking cartoon mouse!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oddball-comics.com/article.php?story=archiveshaw-04-03&amp;query=mickey%2Bmouse|title= ''Walt Disney Mickey Mouse (Super Secret Agent)''|first= Scott|last= Shaw|authorlink= Scott Shaw (artist)|date= April 2, 2003|publisher= Oddball Comics|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20030423000228/http://www.comicbookresources.com/columns/oddball/index.cgi?date=2003-04-03|archivedate= April 23, 2003|deadurl= yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spiegle and writer [[Donald F. Glut]] co-created the [[Doctor Spektor]] character in ''Mystery Comics Digest'' #5 (July 1972).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.toonopedia.com/spektor.htm |title=Doctor Spektor |first=Don |last=Markstein |date=2007 |publisher=[[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6cYejQCYV?url=http://www.toonopedia.com/spektor.htm |archivedate=October 26, 2015 |deadurl=no |df=mdy-all |quote=Dr. Adam Spektor, a researcher of the supernatural, was introduced in ''Mystery Comics Digest'' #5 (July, 1972)...The story was written by Don Glut...and drawn by Dan Spiegle. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Spiegle drew the comic book adaptation of the 1979 [[Walt Disney Pictures]] feature film ''[[The Black Hole]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Arnold|first= Mark|authorlink= Mark Arnold (historian)|title= Adapting Disney's ''The Black Hole''|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 89|pages= 55–58|publisher= TwoMorrows Publishing|date= July 2016|location= Raleigh, North Carolina}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later comics career===
In addition to his naturalistic work adapting live-action television, Spiegle also handled more cartoony material such as Gold Key's [[Saturday-morning TV animation]] title, ''[[Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!|Hanna-Barbera Scooby-Doo... Where Are You!]]'', starting with issue #16 (Feb. 1973). Five issues later marked his first teaming with writer [[Mark Evanier]], with whom he would continue to the final Gold Key issue, #30 (Feb. 1975).&lt;ref name= gcd /&gt; The two worked on the character again from 1977 to 1979 when [[Marvel Comics]] licensed the property, doing all nine issues of ''Scooby-Doo'', and reprised their team-up in 1996 when [[Archie Comics]] acquired the Scooby-Doo license.&lt;ref name=gcd  /&gt;

Spiegle later moved to [[DC Comics]] and worked on many of their features, such as ''[[Unknown Soldier (DC Comics)|Unknown Soldier]]'', ''Tomahawk'', ''[[Jonah Hex]]'', and ''[[Teen Titans]] Spotlight'' until the early 1990s.  His most notable work was the "[[Nemesis (DC Comics)|Nemesis]]" backup series in ''[[The Brave and the Bold]]'' with writer [[Cary Burkett]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Trumbull|first = John|title = Nemesis Balancing the Scales|journal= Back Issue!|issue = 64|pages = 69–75|publisher = TwoMorrows Publishing|date = May 2013|location= Raleigh, North Carolina}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on ''[[Blackhawk (DC Comics)|Blackhawk]]'' with Mark Evanier.  He and writer [[Bob Rozakis]] created the character [[Mister E]] in ''[[Secrets of Haunted House]]'' #31 (Dec. 1980).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Manning|first= Matthew K.|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1980s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher= [[Dorling Kindersley]]|date= 2010|location= London, United Kingdom|isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9|page= 189|quote= In the last feature of its thirty-first issue, a story by writer Bob Rozakis and artist Dan Spiegle, a new monster hunter named Mister E was introduced.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the character [[Crossfire (Eclipse Comics)|Crossfire]] was created by  [[Mark Evanier]] and [[Will Meugniot]] in ''[[DNAgents]]'' published by [[Eclipse Comics]], Spiegle penciled and inked every issue of the comic book ''Crossfire'', as well as ''Crossfire and Rainbow'', and ''Whodunnit?'', which featured Crossfire. Evanier and Spiegle also did all five issues of ''[[Hollywood Superstars]]'' for Marvel's [[Epic Comics]] imprint.

Spiegle provided the art for ''[[Indiana Jones (comics)|Indiana Jones: Thunder in the Orien]]t'' (1993–1994) and ''[[Indiana Jones and the Spear of Destiny]]'' (1995), published by [[Dark Horse Comics]].&lt;ref name= gcd /&gt; He drew ''[[Nintendo Power]]'' magazine's "Nester's Adventures" feature (formerly ''Howard &amp; Nester'') in its later stages until it was discontinued in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.nintendojo.com/features/specials/comic-relief|title= Comic Relief|first= Andrew|last= Hsieh|date= January 20, 2011|publisher= NintendoDojo|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160221132556/http://www.nintendojo.com/features/specials/comic-relief|archivedate= February 21, 2016|deadurl= no|df=mdy-all|quote= Nintendo showed off just how well-connected it was by having Inkpot Award-winning Dan Spiegle (with a long list of distinguished credits) draw NP‘s beloved mascot.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1990s he drew the short-lived revival of the [[comic strip]] ''[[Terry and the Pirates (comic strip)|Terry and the Pirates]]''&lt;ref name="Lambiek" /&gt; after [[Brothers Hildebrandt|Tim and Greg Hildebrandt]] left. Spiegle worked with the [[Bank Street College of Education]] as an illustrator of a number of "Bank Street Classic Tales" published in ''[[Boys' Life]]'' magazine, Bible stories for the [[American Bible Society]],&lt;ref&gt;Coates p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2008 he teamed up with Evanier again for a new ''Crossfire'' story, drawing the character's portion of the cover of, and the eight-page story "Too Rich to Be Guilty" in About Comics' fancifully numbered ''Many Happy Returns'' #2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Gcdb issue|id= 860848|title= ''Many Happy Returns'' #2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; With no cover date on it or on another work that year &amp;mdash; pages 3 to 20 of "Ragin' Abe Simpson and the Flying Hellfish in: War is Smelly" in [[Bongo Comics Group]]'s licensed TV title ''[[List of The Simpsons comics|Simpsons Comics]]'' #144&lt;ref name= gcd /&gt; &amp;mdash; it is difficult to ascertain which was his last published comics work but it is likely the ''[[Graphic Classics]]'' adaptation of [[Clarence E. Mulford]]'s "Hold Up", penned by Tim Lasiuta, published in March 2011.

Spiegle died on January 28, 2017 at the age of 96.&lt;ref name=death&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.bleedingcool.com/2017/01/30/blackhawk-crossfire-artist-dan-spiegle-passes-away-age-96/ | title=Blackhawk And Crossfire Artist Dan Spiegle Passes Away At Age 96|first= Dan |last=Wickline |date=January 30, 2017 |accessdate=January 30, 2017| publisher=[[BleedingCool.com]]| archivedate=January 30, 2017| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170130214718/https://www.bleedingcool.com/2017/01/30/blackhawk-crossfire-artist-dan-spiegle-passes-away-age-96/|deadurl=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.coastalview.com/obituaries/dan-spiegle/article_18bb42d8-e98a-11e6-b15b-7bdc1cbce8cd.html|title= Dan Spiegle|date= February 2, 2017|publisher= CoastalView.com|archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/6qdaHTUJp?url=http://www.coastalview.com/obituaries/dan-spiegle/article_18bb42d8-e98a-11e6-b15b-7bdc1cbce8cd.html|archivedate= May 22, 2017|deadurl= no|df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
