[[File:Mushadhannah52453.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Hannah and Ad Carter's ''Mush Stebbins and His Sister'' (May 24, 1953). In 1950, the title of ''Just Kids'' changed to ''Mush Stebbins and His Sister''.]]
'''August Daniel Carter''' (1895â€“1957) was an American [[comic strip]] cartoonist who created the long-running ''Just Kids'' strip. He was known as '''Ad Carter''', the signature he used on his strips.

Born in [[Baltimore|Baltimore, Maryland]], Carter was 11 years old when his mother died, a situation which led him into the work force as a youth.&lt;ref name=lam&gt;[http://www.lambiek.net/artists/c/carter_a.htm Lambiek]&lt;/ref&gt; While employed as a ''[[Brooklyn Eagle]]'' reporter, he met the cartoonist [[Clare Briggs]], who encouraged him to submit a comic strip to a syndicate. In 1916, Carter drew ''Our Friend Mush'', a strip about a gang of kids.&lt;ref name=lam/&gt;

==''Just Kids''==
In 1922, Carter was hired by [[William Randolph Hearst]] to create similar kid characters for a new strip, ''Just Kids''. It was launched as a daily July 23, 1923, with the [[Sunday strip]] following during the next month. Later that decade, Carter began another strip, ''Nicodemus O'Malley'', which also featured kids as the main characters. In 1950, the title of ''Just Kids'' changed to ''Mush Stebbins and His Sister''.&lt;ref name=lam/&gt;&lt;ref name=strip/&gt; Comics historian [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia|Don Markstein]] described the ''Just Kids'' gang:
:Mush Stebbins continued as part of an ensemble cast... Other regulars included Mush's pals, Fatso Dolan and Pat Chan, the latter adding a touch of racial diversity back before diversity was cool. The group functioned as a kid gang operating in and around a small town called Barnsville, sort of like the later Archie and his pals, but younger, did in Riverdale... His specific source of inspiration was ''Reg'lar Fellers'', by [[Gene Byrnes]], of which ''Just Kids'' was a blatant copy. This was part of the same trend as Tillie Jones's similarity to [[Winnie Winkle]] and Annie Rooney's to that other Annie. When a comic proved popular for another syndicate, Hearst usually wanted his own version of it. ''Just Kids'' even looked like ''Reg'lar Fellers'', as Carter imitated Byrnes' art style as well as his character set-up, especially in the early days. But while the imitation was never as popular as the original, it still carved out its own place in the public consciousness. In addition to pins, dolls, games and other merchandised products, it was the subject of a coloring book in 1928 and a 16-page comic book reprint in 1932. Starting in 1934, it was the subject of at least a half-dozen [[Big Little Book series|Big Little Books]]. In the late '30s, as modern-style comic books rose to prominence, [[Dell Comics]] put it in the back pages of several of its comic strip reprints.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toonopedia.com/justkids.htm ''Just Kids''] at [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]]. [https://www.webcitation.org/6WpyhxyC1?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftoonopedia.com%2Fjustkids.htm Archived] from the original on March 6, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books==
''The Adventures of Just Kids'' was published by Saalfield in 1934. ''Just Kids and Deep-Sea Dan'' was a 1940 Big Little Book published by Whitman.

An offshoot of the [[National Safety Council]], the ''Just Kids'' Safety Club had 413,743 boys and girls as members.

Carter was married twice.  With his first wife Kathleen, he had two children, a daughter Eileen and a son Wallace. His second wife, Hannah Carter, worked with him on his later strips in the 1950s. Carter died in New York in 1957.&lt;ref name=strip&gt;[http://strippersguide.blogspot.com/2006/03/long-slow-demise-of-just-kids.html Stripper's Guide]&lt;/ref&gt;
