'''Scott Adams''' (born June 8, 1957) is the creator of the ''[[Dilbert]]'' [[comic strip]] and the author of several nonfiction works of satire, commentary, and business.

His ''Dilbert'' series came to national prominence through the downsizing period in 1990s America and was then distributed worldwide. Adams worked in various roles at big businesses before he became a full-time cartoonist in 1995. He writes in a [[satire|satirical]], often [[sarcasm|sarcastic]], way about the social and psychological landscape of [[white-collar worker]]s in modern business [[corporation]]s.

==Early life==
Scott Raymond Adams was born in 1957 in [[Windham, New York]], the son of Paul and Virginia (née Vining) Adams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=Ancestry |url=http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nygreen2/obituaries_from_the_windham_journal_february_2011.htm |title=Virginia Adams obituary |accessdate=January 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Adams |first=Scott |trans-title=Dilbert's future: how to prosper in the XXI Century thanks to stupidity |title=El Futuro de Dilbert: Como Prosperar en el Siglo XXI Gracias a la Esupidez |date=1999 |publisher=Ediciones Granica |isbn=978-84-7577615-6 |page=5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bwF30SmhkGAC&amp;pg=PR5#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=July 21, 2016 |language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is of half-German descent,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Adams |first=Scott |url=http://blog.dilbert.com/post/140800778006/lets-talk-about-hitler |title=Let's Talk About Hitler |accessdate=March 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he also has English, Irish, Welsh, Scottish, Dutch, and "a small amount" of American Indian ancestry.&lt;ref name= "Blog post"&gt;{{cite web |last=Adams |first=Scott |url=http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2007/07/immigration.html |title=Immigration |accessdate=November 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Twitter"&gt;{{cite web |last=Adams |first=Scott |work=Twitter |url=https://twitter.com/scottadamssays/status/752621060210561024 |title=I'm part Native American |accessdate=November 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "YouTube"&gt;{{cite web |last=Adams |first=Scott |work=You tube |publisher=Google |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJCJpmUAy0s#t=76m55s |title=Joe Rogan Experience No. 874 |accessdate=November 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a fan of the ''[[Peanuts]]'' comics while growing up, and he started drawing his own comics at age six.&lt;ref name= "2.0"&gt;{{cite book |last=Adams |first=Scott |title=Dilbert 2.0: 20 years of Dilbert |year=2008 |publisher=Andrews McMeel |location=Jamaica City |isbn=0-7407-7735-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He won a drawing competition at age 11.&lt;ref name="2.0" /&gt; 

Adams graduated [[valedictorian]] at [[Windham-Ashland-Jewett Central School]] in 1975 in a class of 39. He remained in the area and received a BA in economics from [[Hartwick College]] in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.dilbert.com/about |title=About Scott Adams |work=Dilbert |access-date= June 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He moved to California a few months after his graduation.&lt;ref name= "2.0" /&gt;

==Career==
===Office worker===
Adams worked closely with telecommunications engineers at [[Crocker National Bank]] in San Francisco between 1979 and 1986. Upon joining the organization, he entered a management training program after being held at gunpoint twice in four months as a [[Bank teller|teller]].&lt;ref name="2.0"/&gt; Over the years, his positions included management trainee, [[Programmer|computer programmer]], budget analyst, commercial lender, product manager, and supervisor.&lt;ref name="2.0"/&gt; He earned an [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] in economics and management from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Scott Adams MBA 86 |publisher=[[Haas School of Business]] |url=http://ewmba.haas.berkeley.edu/community/alumni/profiles/adams_scott.html | access-date=October 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adams created ''Dilbert'' during this period; the name came from ex-boss Mike Goodwin. Dogbert, originally named Dildog, was loosely based on his family's deceased pet beagle Lucy.&lt;ref name="2.0"/&gt; Submissions to various publications of both ''Dilbert'' and non-''Dilbert'' comic panels failed to win publication. These included ''[[The New Yorker]]'' and ''[[Playboy]]''. However, an inspirational letter from a fan persuaded Adams to keep trying.&lt;ref name="2.0"/&gt;

He worked at [[Pacific Bell]] between 1986 and June 1995; the personalities he encountered there became the inspiration for many of his ''Dilbert'' characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=André |last=Spicer |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/nov/23/from-inboxing-to-thought-showers-how-business-bullshit-took-over |title=From inboxing to thought showers: how business bullshit took over |newspaper=The Guardian |date=November 23, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Adams first published ''Dilbert'' with [[United Media]] in 1989, while still employed at Pacific Bell. He had to draw his cartoons at 4&amp;nbsp;a.m. in order to work a full day at the company. His first paycheck for ''Dilbert'' was a monthly royalty check of $368.62.&lt;ref name="2.0"/&gt; Gradually, ''Dilbert'' became more popular, and was published by 100 newspapers in 1991 and 400 by 1994. Adams attributes his success to his idea of including his e-mail address in the panels, thus facilitating feedback from readers.&lt;ref name="2.0"/&gt;

===Full-time cartoonist===
Adams's success grew, and he became a full-time cartoonist with ''Dilbert'' in 800 newspapers. In 1996, ''[[The Dilbert Principle]]'' was released, his first business book.&lt;ref name="2.0"/&gt;

[[Logitech]] CEO [[Pierluigi Zappacosta]] invited Adams to impersonate a management consultant, which he did wearing a wig and false mustache. He tricked Logitech managers into adopting a [[mission statement]] that Adams described as "so impossibly complicated that it has no real content whatsoever".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www7.mercurycenter.com/archives/dilbert/mission_index.html |title=Mission: Impertinent |date=November 16, 1997 |accessdate=April 14, 2014 |work=San Jose Mercury News |first=Tia |last=O'Brien |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000817044342/http://www7.mercurycenter.com/archives/dilbert/mission_index.html |archivedate=August 17, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year, he won the [[National Cartoonists Society]]'s Reuben Award for Outstanding Cartoonist of the Year and Best Newspaper Comic Strip of 1997, the most prestigious awards in the field.&lt;ref name="2.0" /&gt;

In 1998, ''Dilbert'' began as a TV series, but was canceled in 2000. By 2000, the comic was in 2,000 newspapers in 57 countries and 19 languages.&lt;ref name="2.0"/&gt;

{{quotation| Finally, I got the call. "You're number one." I still haven't popped the champagne. I just raise the bar for what would be the right moment, and tell myself how tasty it will be if I ever accomplish something special in my work. Apparently the thing inside me that makes me work so hard is the same thing that keeps me unsatisfied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2007/06/champagne-momen.html |title=The Dilbert Blog |accessdate=March 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Adams was a fan of the science fiction TV series ''[[Babylon 5]]'', and he appeared in the season 4 episode "[[Moments of Transition]]" as a character named "Mr. Adams" who hires former head of security [[Michael Garibaldi]] to locate his megalomaniacal dog and cat.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|517671|Moments of Transition}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also had a cameo in "[[NewsRadio season 3#Review|Review]]", a third-season episode of the TV series ''[[NewsRadio]]'', in which Matthew Brock (played by [[Andy Dick]]) becomes an obsessed ''Dilbert'' fan. Adams is credited as "Guy in line behind Dave and Joe in first scene".&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|660220|Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adams is the CEO of Scott Adams Foods, Inc., makers of the [[Dilberito]] and Protein Chef, and a co-owner of Stacey's Café in [[Pleasanton, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About Us |url=http://www.eatatstaceys.com/staceys-cafe/about-us.php |publisher=eatatstaceys.com |accessdate=January 7, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304215947/http://www.eatatstaceys.com/staceys-cafe/about-us.php |archivedate=March 4, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Adams is a member of the [[International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences]] and a former member of [[Mensa International|Mensa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Adams |first=Scott |title=Famous People Lists |work=Dilbert Blog |date=September 29, 2008 |access-date=June 12, 2010 |url=http://www.dilbert.com/blog/entry/famous_people_lists/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, Adams has had two notable health problems. Since late 2004, he has suffered from a reemergence of [[focal dystonia]], which has affected his ability to draw for lengthy periods on paper,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/05/09/AR2005050901066.html |title=Scott Adams, Drawing the Line |date=May 10, 2005 |access-date=January 28, 2008 |work=The Washington Post |first=Samantha |last=Sordyl}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it causes no real problem now that he draws the comic on a [[graphics tablet]]. He also suffered from [[spasmodic dysphonia]], a condition that causes the [[vocal cords]] to behave in an abnormal manner. He recovered from this condition temporarily, but in July 2008 underwent surgery to reroute the nerve connections to his vocal cords.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/cartoonlounge/2008/10/scott-adams-dilbert.html |work=The New Yorker |title=An Interview with the "Dilbert" Cartoonist Scott Adams |date=October 29, 2008 |access-date=October 29, 2008 |author=Zachary Kanin}}&lt;/ref&gt; The operation was successful, and Adams' voice is now completely functional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title='Dilbert' creator recovers from rare disorder |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/15446515/ns/health-health_care/t/dilbert-creator-recovers-rare-disorder |publisher=MSNBC |access-date=January 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adams is a [[Vegetarianism|vegetarian]] and trained as a [[Hypnosis|hypnotist]].&lt;ref&gt;Mentioned in ''Dilbert: A Treasury of Sunday Strips''&lt;/ref&gt; He credits his own success to [[Affirmations (New Age)|affirmations]], including ''Dilbert''{{'}}s success and achieving a ninety-fourth percentile on a difficult qualification exam for business school, among other unlikely events. He states that the affirmations give him focus.&lt;ref&gt;Mentioned in ''The Dilbert Future''&lt;/ref&gt; He has described a method which he has used that he says gave him success. He pictured in his mind what he wanted, and wrote it down 15 times a day on a piece of paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/wealth/2012/04/12/can-you-get-rich-by-visualizing-yourself-rich/ |title=Can You Get Rich by Visualizing Yourself Rich? |author=Robert Frank |work=The Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In addition to his cartoon work, he has written two books on religion, ''God's Debris'' (2001), and ''The Religion War'' (2004). ''God's Debris'' lays out a theory of [[Pandeism]], in which God blows itself up to see what will happen, which becomes the cause of our universe.&lt;ref&gt;Knujon Mapson, "A Brief History of Pandeism," ''Pandeism: An Anthology'' (2017), p. 31-32.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Adams married Shelly Miles in 2006. She has two children named Savannah and Justin Miles. In a February 2014 blog posting he revealed that he is no longer married.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dilbert.com/blog/entry/whats_the_goal_with_robots_read_news |title=What's the Goal with Robots Read News? |access-date=February 18, 2014 |author=Scott Adams |date=February 18, 2014 |work=The Scott Adams Blog|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140224111845/http://dilbert.com/blog/entry/whats_the_goal_with_robots_read_news |archivedate=February 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kristina Basham, a model and baker, is Adams' girlfriend with whom he lives. She has two daughters, and is vice president of [[WhenHub]].&lt;ref name="How Donald Trump Hypnotized Scott Adams"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Winter |first1=Caroline |title=How Donald Trump Hypnotized Scott Adams |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-03-22/how-dilbert-s-scott-adams-got-hypnotized-by-trump |publisher=Bloomberg L.P. |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170326101433/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-03-22/how-dilbert-s-scott-adams-got-hypnotized-by-trump |archivedate=March 26, 2017 |date=March 22, 2017 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adams has often commented on political matters. Despite this, in 2016 he wrote on his blog "I don't vote and I am not a member of a political party."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.dilbert.com/post/141605245101/whos-afraid-of-donald-trump |title=Who's Afraid of Donald Trump? |date=March 24, 2016 |author=Scott Adams |work=Scott Adams' Blog |access-date=March 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, he suggested that [[Michael Bloomberg]] would make a good presidential candidate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2007/05/bloomberg_for_p.html |title=Bloomberg for President? |access-date=February 14, 2011 |author=Scott Adams |date=May 16, 2007 |work=The Dilbert Blog|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070519070724/http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2007/05/bloomberg_for_p.html |archivedate=May 19, 2007|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the 2008 presidential election he said, "On social issues, I lean [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian]], minus the crazy stuff",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/09/16/dilbert.economy/index.html |publisher=CNN |title=Commentary: Dilbert guy's economic poll on McCain, Obama&amp;nbsp;— CNN |date=September 16, 2008 |access-date=May 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but said in December 2011 that, if he were president, he would do whatever [[Bill Clinton]] advised him to do because that "would lead to policies that are a sensible middle ground".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dilbert.com/blog/entry/the_persuasive_candidate |title=The Persuasive Candidate |access-date=December 6, 2011 |author=Scott Adams |date=December 5, 2011 |work=The Dilbert Blog|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120108034509/http://dilbert.com/blog/entry/the_persuasive_candidate|archive-date=January 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a blog post from September 2017, Adams considers himself to be "left of [[Bernie Sanders|Bernie [Sanders]]], but with a preference for plans that can work."&lt;ref name="leftsanders"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.dilbert.com/post/165585434916/how-a-silicon-valley-investor-does-leadership |title=How a Silicon Valley Investor Does Leadership |work=Scott Adams' Blog |date=September 21, 2017 |access-date=October 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 17, 2012, he wrote "while I don't agree with [[Mitt Romney|Romney]]'s positions on most topics, I'm endorsing him for president".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.dilbert.com/2012/10/17/firing-offense/ |title=Firing Offense |access-date=January 10, 2018 |author=Scott Adams |date=October 17, 2012 |work=The Dilbert Blog|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018111032/http://dilbert.com/blog/entry/firing_offense|archive-date=October 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2016 United States presidential election===
In 2015, although Adams stated that he would not endorse a candidate for the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 elections]], he repeatedly praised [[Donald Trump]]'s persuasion skills, especially on his blog,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.dilbert.com/post/139541975641/the-trump-master-persuader-index-and-reading-list |title=The Trump Master Persuader Index and Reading List}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55NxKENplG4 |title=Dilbert Creator Scott Adams on Donald Trump's "Linguistic Kill Shots"}}&lt;/ref&gt; extensively detailing what he called Trump's "talent stack".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Trump Talent Stack |url=http://blog.dilbert.com/post/153775344216/the-trump-talent-stack |website=blog.dilbert.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Adams' talent stack actually refers not to talent, but rather to skill; moreover, the talents/skills are not ordered, and so they are not a stack, but rather a set: thus, a ''talent stack'' is actually what is commonly known as a ''[[skill set]]''.)

Adams correctly predicted Trump would win the Republican nomination and the general election;&lt;ref name="trump"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Suebsaeng|first1=Asawin|title='Dilbert' Creator on How Trump Is Like The Founding Fathers &amp; Jesus|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/09/14/dilbert-creator-on-how-trump-is-like-the-founding-fathers-jesus.html|website=The Daily Beast|date=September 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the 2016 election campaign's final weeks, except for a temporary reversal in early October, Adams repeatedly said Trump would win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The era of women|url=http://blog.dilbert.com/post/151737656851/the-era-of-women|website=Scott Adams' Blog|date=October 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The bully party|url=http://blog.dilbert.com/post/152293480726/the-bully-party|website=Scott Adams' Blog|date=October 25, 2016|quote=Today I put Trump's odds of winning in a landslide back to 98%.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The persuasion scorecard|url=http://blog.dilbert.com/post/152644376081/the-persuasion-scorecard-update-one-week-out |website=Scott Adams' Blog|date=November 2, 2016|quote=I predict Trump wins in a landslide}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=I don't want a government job|url=http://blog.dilbert.com/post/152811465446/i-dont-want-a-government-job|website=Scott Adams' Blog|date=November 6, 2016|quote=On election day, should Trump win as I predict, I ask for Trump supporters to stay cool when the predictable riots erupt.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Adams has shared on his blog and elsewhere that men may feel emasculated by the nomination of a female candidate for president. Of the [[2016 Democratic National Convention]], he said the following: "If you're an undecided voter, and male, you're seeing something different. You're seeing a celebration that your role in society is permanently diminished. And it's happening in an impressive venue that was, in all likelihood, designed and built mostly by men."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.dilbert.com/post/148050318231/selling-past-the-close|title=Selling Past the Close – Scott Adams' Blog|access-date=September 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Adams said that he temporarily endorsed Hillary Clinton purely out of fear for his own life, stating he had received direct and indirect death threats.&lt;ref name="persuasion"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.dilbert.com/post/147247313346/when-persuasion-turns-deadly|title=When Persuasion Turns Deadly}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late September, however, Adams officially switched his endorsement from Clinton to Trump. Among his primary reasons for the switch were his respect for Trump's persuasion skills over Clinton's, Clinton's proposal to raise the [[inheritance tax]] to 65%, and his concerns over Clinton's health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.dilbert.com/post/150919416661/why-i-switched-my-endorsement-from-clinton-to|title=Why I Switched My Endorsement from Clinton to Trump|work=Scott Adams' Blog|date=September 25, 2016|access-date=September 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adams states that writing about Donald Trump ended his speaking career and reduced his income by about 40%.&lt;ref name="persuasion" /&gt;
