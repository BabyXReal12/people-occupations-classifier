'''Murray Olderman''' (born March 27, 1922) is an American sports cartoonist and writer.&lt;ref name=Horgan&gt;Horgan, Richard. [http://www.mediabistro.com/articles/details.asp?aID=12102&amp;c=mbennf "SO WHAT DO YOU DO, MURRAY OLDERMAN, ICONIC SPORTS JOURNALIST AND CARTOONIST?,"] ''Media Bistro'' (May 21, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; His artwork often accompanied the sports stories he authored. His art also has been used by the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] and hung above the Hall of Fame busts. Recently, the Hall of Fame made all of the artwork digital so it must be accessed by visitors to the hall through electronic kiosks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.profootballhof.com/story/2005/1/1/607/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150407045813/http://www.profootballhof.com/story/2005/1/1/607/ |archivedate=2015-04-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Olderman aspired to be a sportswriter at an early age. When he was in his teens, he wrote sports columns for a county weekly.&lt;ref name=Horgan/&gt; He practiced drawing cartoons through trial and error. One of his drawings was first published in ''[[Columbia Missourian|The Columbia Missourian]]'' during his junior year at the [[University of Missouri]].&lt;ref name=Horgan/&gt; Olderman graduated from [[University of Missouri]] with a [[Bachelor of Journalism|B.J.]] degree, [[Stanford University]] with a [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] in humanities, and [[Northwestern University]]'s [[Medill School of Journalism]] with a master's degree in journalism.&lt;ref name=Horgan/&gt;

==Career==
Olderman was hired by the [[The McClatchy Company|McClatchy Newspapers]] of Sacramento as a sports cartoonist.&lt;ref name=Horgan/&gt;

Olderman's work appeared in 750 daily newspapers for the greater part of 35 years. His columns and cartoons were distributed by the [[Newspaper Enterprise Association]] (NEA), a Scripps-Howard syndicate.&lt;ref name=Horgan /&gt; Olderman's employment with the NEA began in 1952; he became its sports editor in 1964; executive editor in 1968; and a contributing editor in 1971. Although he "retired" in 1987, he was active until the news service was overtaken by a larger corporation.

Olderman is the founder of the [[Jim Thorpe Trophy]], for the National Football League’s Most Valuable Player, and distributed by the Newspaper Enterprise Association.&lt;ref name=Horgan /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishsports.net/biopages/MurrayOlderman.htm Olderman bio], Jewish Sports.net. Accessed Aug. 25, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; He also founded the NEA All-Pro team in 1954, which ran through 1992.&lt;ref name=Horgan /&gt; It was considered the "Player's All-Pro team", since Olderman would poll NFL players to compile the team.

== Awards ==
Olderman received the [[National Cartoonist Society]] Sports Cartoon Award for 1974 and 1978.  He received the [[Pro Football Writers Association]] [[Dick McCann Memorial Award]] in 1979, which is considered to be the writer's wing of the Pro Football Hall of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dick McCann Memorial Award]]&lt;/ref&gt; Olderman was inducted into the [[National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association]] [[NSSA Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] in 1993. In 1997 he was inducted to the [[International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame]]. He was inducted into the Northwestern University Medill Hall of Achievement for 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.northwestern.edu/newscenter/stories/2014/04/medill-inducts-six-alumni-into-hall-of-achievement.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Olderman is a longtime resident of [[Rancho Mirage, California]].
