'''Kim Deitch''' (born May 21, 1944&lt;ref name = WhosWho /&gt; in [[Los Angeles]])&lt;ref name=Apex&gt;Donahue, Don and Susan Goodrick, editors. Deitch bio, ''The Apex Treasuet of Underground Comics'' (Apex Novelties, 1974), p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[People of the United States|American]] [[cartoonist]] who was an important figure in the [[underground comix]] movement of the 1960s, remaining active in the decades that followed with a variety of books and comics, sometimes using the pseudonym '''Fowlton Means'''.

Much of Kim Deitch's work deals with the animation industry and characters from the world of cartoons.&lt;ref name=lam&gt;[http://www.lambiek.net/artists/d/deitch.htm Kim Deitch] at the [[Lambiek Comiclopedia]]. Retrieved on November 12, 2013. [https://web.archive.org/web/20150907063815/https://www.lambiek.net/artists/d/deitch.htm Archived] from the original on September 7, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; His best-known character is a mysterious cat named Waldo, who appears variously as a famous cartoon character of the 1930s, as an actual character in the "reality" of the strips, as the hallucination of a hopeless alcoholic surnamed Mishkin (a victim of the [[The Boulevard of Broken Dreams (comics)|Boulevard of Broken Dreams]]), as the demonic reincarnation of [[Judas Iscariot]]; and who, occasionally, is claimed to have overcome Deitch and written the comics himself. Waldo's appearance is reminiscent of such black cat characters as [[Felix the Cat]], [[Julius the Cat]], and [[Krazy Kat]].

The son of illustrator and [[animator]] [[Gene Deitch]], Kim Deitch has sometimes worked with his brothers [[Simon Deitch]] and Seth Deitch.&lt;ref name=lam /&gt;

== Biography ==
Deitch's influences include [[Winsor McCay]], [[Chester Gould]], [[Jack Cole (artist)|Jack Cole]], and [[Will Eisner]]; he attended the [[Pratt Institute]].&lt;ref name=WhosWho&gt;{{cite web|authorlink=Jerry Bails |last=Bails |first=Jerry |author2=Hames Ware |title=Kim Deitch |url=http://www.bailsprojects.com/(S(pz0nis55gdcxtz45absq5f55))/bio.aspx?Name=DEITCH%2c+KIM |work=Who's Who of American Comic Books 1928-1999 |accessdate=November 12, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905081043/http://www.bailsprojects.com/%28S%28pz0nis55gdcxtz45absq5f55%29%29/bio.aspx?Name=DEITCH%2C%2BKIM |archivedate=September  5, 2015 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before deciding to become a professional cartoonist, Deitch worked odd jobs and did manual labor, including with the [[merchant marine]]. Searching for a path, he at one point joined the  [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]; at another point he became devotee of [[Hatha yoga]].&lt;ref name=Apex /&gt;

Deitch regularly contributed comical, psychedelia-tinged comic strips (featuring the flower child "Sunshine Girl" and "The India Rubber Man") to New York City's premier underground newspaper, the ''[[East Village Other]]'', beginning in 1967. He joined [[Bhob Stewart]] as an editor of EVO's all-comics spin-off, ''[[Gothic Blimp Works]]'', in 1969. During this period, he lived with fellow cartoonist [[Spain Rodriguez]] in a sixth-floor walk-up apartment in New York's [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]].&lt;ref name=Apex /&gt;

Deitch was also a publisher, as co-founder of the [[Cartoonists Co-Op Press]], a publishing venture by Deitch, [[Jay Lynch]], [[Bill Griffith]], Jerry Lane, [[Willy Murphy]], [[Diane Noomin]], and [[Art Spiegelman]] that operated in 1973–1974.

Deitch's ''[[The Boulevard of Broken Dreams (comics)|The Boulevard of Broken Dreams]]'' was chosen by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine in 2005 as one of the 100 best English-language graphic novels ever written.&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://entertainment.time.com/2005/10/16/all-time-100-novels/slide/times-list-of-the-100-best-novels/#all |title=Time's List of the 100 Best Novels (1923–2005) |last=Kelly |first=James |author2=Lev Grossman |author3=Richard Lacayo |date=October 16, 2005 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the [[Museum of Comic and Cartoon Art]] featured a retrospective exhibition of his work.&lt;ref&gt;Beck, Jerry.

== Personal life ==
From his first marriage, to cartoonist and author [[Trina Robbins]], Deitch has a daughter, Casey.&lt;ref name=comicsthroughtime&gt;Murphyao, Amanda, in {{cite book| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=hnuQBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA548&amp;lpg=PA548&amp;dq=gene+deitch+kim+simon&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=G4VvqCmh4V&amp;sig=aKIlOLeYpfHYcbUN-wo8wrcrcsY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwA2oVChMIvOyN7vj6yAIVzDY-Ch2Qkgga#v=onepage&amp;q=gene%20deitch%20kim%20simon&amp;f=false | title=Comics through Time: A History of Icons, Idols, and Ideas | chapter=Deitch, Kim (1944- ) | first=M. Keith, ed.|last= Booker| publisher=Greenwood |year=2014 | isbn = 978-0313397509}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Through most of the 1970s, Deitch was in an 11-year relationship with animator [[Sally Cruikshank]].&lt;ref name=DeitchTCJ /&gt;&lt;ref name = WhosWho /&gt; He met Pam Butler in 1994 and they subsequently married.&lt;ref name=comicsthroughtime /&gt;

==Awards==
Deitch won the 2003 [[Eisner Award]] for Best Single Issue/Story for ''The Stuff of Dreams'' (Fantagraphics)&lt;ref name="Eisners2003" /&gt; and in 2008 he was awarded an [[Inkpot Award]]. In 2014, he was nominated for the [[Ignatz Award]] for Outstanding Graphic Novel for ''The Amazing, Enlightening and Absolutely True Adventures of Katherine Whaley''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Canva|first1=Michael|title=SMALL PRESS EXPO: Here are your nominees for the 2014 SPX Ignatz Awards…|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/comic-riffs/wp/2014/08/18/small-press-expo-here-are-your-nominees-for-the-2014-spx-ignatz-awards/|website=The Washington Post|accessdate=18 August 2014|date=August 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
