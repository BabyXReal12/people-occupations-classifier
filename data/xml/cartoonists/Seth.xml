'''Seth''' is the [[pen name]] of '''Gregory Gallant''' (born September 16, 1962), a Canadian [[cartoonist]] best known for his series ''[[Palookaville (comics)|Palookaville]]'' and his mock-[[Autobiographical comics|autobiographical graphic novel]] ''[[It's a Good Life, If You Don't Weaken]]'' (1996).

Seth draws in a style influenced by the classic cartoonists of ''[[The New Yorker]]''.  His work is highly nostalgic, especially for the early-to-mid-20th Century period, and of [[Southern Ontario]].  His work also shows a great depth and breadth of knowledge of the history of [[comics]] and [[cartooning]].

==Personal life==

Seth was born Gregory Gallant in [[Clinton, Ontario|Clinton]], [[Ontario]], Canada.&lt;ref name="BookslutInterview2004" /&gt;  He attended the [[Ontario College of Art]] in [[Toronto]].{{sfn|Thalheimer|2010|p=560}}  As of 2004, he lives in [[Guelph]], Ontario, with his wife Tania.&lt;ref name="BookslutInterview2004" /&gt;

==Career==

Seth, then living in Toronto, first drew attention to his work in 1985 when he took over art duties from the [[Hernandez brothers]] for ''[[Mister X (Vortex)|Mister X]]'' from Toronto publisher [[Vortex Comics]].  In April 1991 he launched his own comic book, ''[[Palookaville (comics)|Palookaville]]'', with Montreal publisher [[Drawn and Quarterly]].  By this time, Seth's artwork had evolved to a style inspired by ''[[The New Yorker]]'' cartoons of the 1930s and 1940s.{{sfn|Bongco|2000|p=199}}
&lt;!-- Seth's first published comics work was providing the artwork to the [[Vortex Comics]] series ''[[Mister X (Vortex)|Mister X]]'', shortly after [[Los Bros Hernandez]] left.  He left after issue #13, and went into illustration for a few years.  In 1990, he began his own series, ''[[Palookaville (comics)|Palooka-ville]]'', which was one of the first series to be published by [[Montréal]], Canada-based [[Drawn and Quarterly]].  It became part of a miniature boom in non-[[genre]] [[alternative comics]] from Canada in the 1990s. Seth, [[Chester Brown]], and [[Joe Matt]] not only also began their own semi-[[autobiographical comics|autobiographical]] series at the same time, but were friends and sometimes depicted each other in their stories. ''Palooka-Ville'' began as a low-key chronicle of the artist's daily life but moved on to longer and more ambitious stories, including what was later collected as the [[graphic novel]] ''[[It's a Good Life, If You Don't Weaken]]''. --&gt;

He is also a magazine illustrator and book designer, perhaps best known for his work designing the [[The Complete Peanuts|complete collection]] of [[Charles M. Schulz]]'s classic [[comic strip]] ''[[Peanuts]]''. The books, released by [[Fantagraphics Books]] in 25 separate volumes (so far) combine Seth's signature aesthetic with Schulz's minimalistic comic creation. Similarly, he is designing the ''Collected [[Doug Wright (cartoonist)|Doug Wright]]'', and the [[John Stanley (comics)|John Stanley]] Library.

Seth's illustration work includes [[:File:Aimee Mann - Lost in Space.jpg|the cover artwork]] for [[Aimee Mann]]'s album ''[[Lost in Space (album)|Lost in Space]]'' (2001) and the jacket and French flaps for the [[Penguin Classics]] ''Portable [[Dorothy Parker]]'' (2006).{{sfn|Thalheimer|2010|p=561}}

''[[Clyde Fans]]'', the story of two brothers whose trade in electric [[fan (mechanical)|fan]]s suffers and eventually goes out of business from the failure to adapt to the rise of [[air conditioning]], was serialized in ''Palooka-ville''. Seth's short graphic novel ''[[Wimbledon Green]]'', about an eccentric comic-book collector, was published in November 2005.

==Graphic novels==
From September 2006 to March 25, 2007, Seth serialized a graphic novel titled ''[[George Sprott (1894–1975)]]'', for [[New York Times Magazine#The Funny Pages|the Funny Pages]] section of ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sequential.spiltink.org/?p=1263 |title=Sequential &amp;#124; Canadian Comics News &amp; Culture |publisher=Sequential.spiltink.org |date= |accessdate=2012-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Selections from ''George Sprott'' were featured in ''Best American Comics 2009''. In the liner notes of that publication, Seth announced he was expanding ''Sprott'' into a book, filling in gaps that were cut to meet the restraints given by ''NYTM''.  The book was published by Drawn &amp; Quarterly in May 2009.&lt;ref name=DQ&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drawnandquarterly.com/artBio.php?artist=a3dff7dd55a576 |title=Drawn and quarterly |publisher=Drawn and quarterly |date= |accessdate=2012-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seth's affection for early- and mid-20th century [[popular culture]] and his relative disdain for pop culture since then is a recurrent theme in his work, both in terms of the characters (who are often nostalgic for the period) and his artistic style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bryan Miller |url=http://www.bookslut.com/features/2004_06_002650.php |title=An Interview with Seth |publisher=Bookslut |date= |accessdate=2012-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although, as a teenager, he was a vocal fan of mainstream superhero comics; he even had a couple of [[Comic book letter column|fan letters]] published.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

Seth's artwork has landed on the cover of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' three times, which he said was a professional milestone he was happy to achieve.&lt;ref name=parkerinterview&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dorothyparker.com/portable02.html |title=Dorothy Parker Society |publisher=Dorothyparker.com |date=2006-03-15 |accessdate=2012-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seth will be collaborated with children's novelist [[Lemony Snicket]] in his ongoing series ''All the Wrong Questions'', starting with Book One: ''[[Who Could That Be at This Hour?]]'' released October 23, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacbee.com/2012/02/08/4249066/new-lemony-snicket-series-begins.html Sacbee.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211031820/http://www.sacbee.com/2012/02/08/4249066/new-lemony-snicket-series-begins.html |date=2012-02-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Model buildings==
[[Image:Seth Dominion Models.jpg|thumb|Seth's Dominion models on display at the [[Confederation Centre of the Arts]] in [[Charlottetown]], [[Prince Edward Island]]]] A selection of Seth's original models (studies for his fictional city, Dominion) was included in an exhibition at the [[Phoenix Art Museum]] from April 21 through August 19, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://phxart.org/exhibition/exhibitionuninked.aspx Phxart.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080311133950/http://phxart.org/exhibition/exhibitionuninked.aspx |date=March 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a collaboration between the [[Kitchener-Waterloo Art Gallery]], Seth, and RENDER, one of the buildings from Seth's Dominion City project has been re-built as a walk-in theatre in KW|AG's Eastman Gallery

Seth is the subject of the 2014 documentary film ''[[Seth's Dominion]]'', which received the grand prize for best animated feature at the [[Ottawa International Animation Film Festival]].&lt;ref name=Brownstein&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.montrealgazette.com/entertainment/life+Seth+animated/10273884/story.html|title=The life of Seth, animated|last=Brownstein|first=Bill|date=9 October 2014|work=[[Montreal Gazette]]|accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
