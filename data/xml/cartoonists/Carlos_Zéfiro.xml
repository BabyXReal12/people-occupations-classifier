== Biography ==

Alcides Aguiar Caminha was born in [[São Cristóvão]], [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]]. He was a public employee and lived most time of his life in Anchieta, a neighborhood in the suburbs of Rio de Janeiro. As a secondary job, he drew pornographic comics, signed with the pseudonym Carlos Zéfiro. His small publications became famous and popular in Brazil, circulating in the underground scene during 1950 to 1980.

While popular, Zefiro's pornographic comics sold more than 30,000 numbers at once. His publications were known as "catechisms" and were sold illegally. Getting the "catechisms" was not easy. The newsstand owner (jornaleiro in Portuguese) used to sell it only to known consumers. Places attended only by men, like barbershops, were also points of distribution. It was common for boys to borrow the comics from their friends at school. After being read, the books were generally discarded.

It is estimated that Zéfiro created more than 800 different titles. His production was independent and never linked to publishers, except when it represented an illegal activity. Zéfiro drew at his home in Rio de Janeiro, and close friends printed and distributed the "catechisms" over the country, sometimes going abroad to cities in [[Uruguay]] and [[Argentina]]. The plots of the stories were always [[Erotic comics|erotic adventures]], sometimes incestuous, in different scenarios.

With the exception of a few friends, no one knew the real identity of Zéfiro. He was married to Maria Mont Serrat and had five children. He was a public employee and feared legal action against his pornographic comics, which could result in the loss of his government job. He worked, most of the time, as an expert in fingerprinting identification, at the Department of Immigration in Rio de Janeiro. He also lived for a few years in [[Brasília]] during the 1970s.

Caminha feared legal action because of Article 207 of the Federal Law 1711, 1952, which provides punishment to the employee involved in "public incontinence and scandalous". For the society of the time, Zéfiro's pornographic magazines were pure scandal.

[[Emílio Garrastazu Médici]] was the president of Brazil in 1970. That year, on June 10, a military search to find who was responsible for the "catechisms" resulted in the arrest of Hélio Brandão, found with more than 50,000 magazines in Rio de Janeiro. Brandão was the main illegal editor of Zéfiro and had been in jail for three days. After that, he broke his partnership with Caminha, who was not arrested because nobody could prove he was, in fact, Zéfiro. 

Interest in Zéfiro's work declined in the 1970s, when magazines with photos of explicit sex were sold freely on Brazilian newsstands.

===Catechisms===

The origin of the term "catechism" is controversial. In the 1970s, it was said that the author was a former seminarian. This version was powered by the anonymity of Zéfiro, which allowed different interpretations. For some, the term would have occurred spontaneously. Just as the religious books used in catechesis, the pornographic drawings of Zéfiro also helped thousands of young boys to discover sexuality. For others, the name had to do with the habit of newsstand owner to hide the magazines in other publications, sometimes religious. Another version says that the term may be the adaptation to Portuguese of the [[Tijuana Bibles]], erotic comics sold illegally in the [[United States]] between 1930 and 1950, another version affirms that its inspiration were [[Romance comics]] of the publisher Mexican-Brazilian Editormex&lt;ref name="tijuana"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://extra.globo.com/lazer/materias/2010/11/08/raros-quadrinhos-eroticos-americanos-dos-anos-1930-50-ganham-caixa-de-luxo-em-portugues-922967543.asp|title=Raros quadrinhos eróticos americanos dos anos 1930 a 50 ganham caixa de luxo em português|author=Tom Leão|date=November 8, 2010|journal=[[Extra (newspaper)|Extra]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[photo comics]] pornography from [[Sweden]].&lt;ref name="trilha"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.universohq.com/noticias/conheca-mais-detalhes-sobre-o-album-na-trilha-do-prazer/|title=Conheça mais detalhes sobre o álbum Na Trilha do Prazer|author=Marcelo Naranjo|date=July 18, 2003|website=Universo HQ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Real identity===

Just a few months before Caminha's death, on July 5, in Rio de Janeiro, Zéfiro's identity was revealed. As he feared legal action against his work, his real name, Alcides Caminha, never came up until November 1991, when a report about Zéfiro was published in the Brazilian version of ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine. The report was signed by Brazilian journalist Juca Kfouri, who was the managing editor of the magazine in Brazil.&lt;ref name="ota"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Costa d'Assunção Barros |first1=Otacílio |title=Carlos Zéfiro |url=http://www.ota.com.br/zefiro.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Songwriting===

Caminha was also a writer of [[samba]] lyrics, and had as a music partner the Brazilian samba singer [[Nelson Cavaquinho]]. They met in Tiradentes Square, in downtown Rio de Janeiro, a place where sambists used to get together. Caminha and Cavaquinho were partners in the composition of at least two songs: ''Notícia'' and ''A Flor e o Espinho''.&lt;ref name="primeira"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oglobo.globo.com/blogs/Gibizada/posts/2007/04/19/a-primeira-vez-de-carlos-zefiro-55246.asp|title=A primeira vez de Carlos Zéfiro|author=Telio Navega|date=April 19, 2007|journal=[[O Globo]]|acessodata=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''A Flor e o Espinho'' represents a controversial matter. The sambist [[Guilherme de Brito]], who also wrote the lyric for the music, said in an interview to Brazilian newspaper ''[[Folha de S.Paulo]]'' that Caminha had only paid Cavaquinho to sign the composition. De Brito told the same version of the story to Flávio Moreira da Costa, author of a book about Cavaquinho. ''A Flor e o Espinho'' was recorded several times, one of them by the famous Brazilian singer and actress [[Elizeth Cardoso]], in 1965. The official record of the Brazilian Union of Composers shows the name of Caminha among the authors of the lyric.

===Tributes===

After the death of Caminha, Zéfiro's work began to be prized as nostalgia, and original editions of his books fetch high prices at auctions. Caminha was honored at events like the first Biennial International Comics Festival, in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. He received the award [[Troféu HQ Mix]], for the importance of his work.

In 1996, Zéfiro's work also illustrated the cover of the CD ''Barulinho Bom'', by the Brazilian [[Música popular brasileira|MPB]] singer [[Marisa Monte]]. In August 1999, in Anchieta, a neighborhood where Caminha lived, a cultural center named Carlos Zéfiro was opened, with a show of [[Marisa Monte]] with Velha Guarda da Portela, a traditional Brazilian samba group. The cultural center had many other shows and workshops, but was closed in 2008.

In 2007, Brazilian journalists Lucas Frasão and Marcio Orsolini began to investigate Caminha's life. After a year, they finished the first version of Zéfiro's biography, which is still being written. Zéfiro was the theme of another three books, published before his death: ''O Quadrinho Erótico de Carlos Zéfiro'', by journalist and cartoonist Otacílio D'Assunção (first editor of the Brazilian version of [[Mad magazine]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://g1.globo.com/Noticias/PopArte/0,,MUL799126-7084,00-OTA+DEIXA+A+MAD+BRASILEIRA+E+PROMETE+LEILOAR+COLECAO+PARTICULAR.html Ota deixa a 'MAD' brasileira e promete leiloar coleção particular]&lt;/ref&gt; ''A Arte Sacana de Carlos Zéfiro'' and ''Os Alunos Sacanas de Carlos Zéfiro'', by Joaquim Marinho.
