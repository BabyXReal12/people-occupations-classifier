'''Rosalind "Roz" Chast''' (born November 26, 1954)&lt;ref&gt;Chast, Roz. ''Can't We Talk About Something More Pleasant?'' (Bloomsbury, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[United States|American]] [[cartoonist]] and a staff cartoonist&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Contributors: Roz Chast|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/bios/roz_chast/search?contributorName=roz%20chast|accessdate=22 November 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111209024058/http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/bios/roz_chast/search?contributorName=roz%20chast|archivedate=9 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; for ''[[The New Yorker]]''. Since 1978, she has published more than 800 cartoons in ''The New Yorker''. She also publishes cartoons in ''[[Scientific American]]'' and the ''[[Harvard Business Review]]''. 

In recognition of her work, [[Comics Alliance]] listed Chast as one of twelve women cartoonists deserving of lifetime achievement recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comicsalliance.com/women-lifetime-achievement-awards/|title=A Life's Work: 12 Women Who Deserve Lifetime Achievement Recognition|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160801110216/http://comicsalliance.com/women-lifetime-achievement-awards/|archivedate=2016-08-01|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2016-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2017, she received the Alumni Award for Artistic Achievement at the Rhode Island School of Design Commencement ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Roz Chast Accepts Alumni Award|url=http://www.our.risd.edu/post/160844480369/roz-chast-accepts-alumni-award|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170722040956/http://our.risd.edu/post/160844480369/roz-chast-accepts-alumni-award|dead-url=yes|archive-date=July 22, 2017|accessdate=8 September 2017|work=Our RISD|date=May 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Chast grew up in the [[Flatbush, Brooklyn|Flatbush]] section of [[Brooklyn]], the only child of George Chast, a high school French and Spanish teacher who subscribed to ''The New Yorker,'' and Elizabeth, an assistant principal in an elementary school. Her Jewish parents were children during the [[Great Depression]], and she has spoken about their extreme frugality.&lt;ref name="Fresh Air 2014"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fresh Air with Terry Gross, December 30, 2014: Interview with Roz Chast; Interview with Louis C.K.|date=December 30, 2014|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/fresh-air-with-terry-gross-december-30-2014-interview-with-roz-chast-interview-with-louis-ck/oclc/958462415|website=Fresh Air with Terry Gross|publisher=National Public Radio (U.S.) WHYY, Inc.|quote= ''[at 20:51]'' My parents were born in 1912. They grew up in the Depression, or graduated from college into the Depression. They kept notebooks where they kept track of every nickel that they spent. And these habits of frugality, from having grown up so poor, to having graduating in the Depression, never left them. They were frugal, they were very careful about money, they used everything up. I remember, my mother would take slivers of soap and put them in a washcloth, and then sew this little soap bag out of the slivers of soap. She made a bathrobe out of towels that she sewed together.}} [http://39ea54ff11b298f9bcaa-1b99eba380497722926169d6da8b098e.r2.cf5.rackcdn.com/2014/FA20141230.mp3 Audio (MP3)]&lt;/ref&gt; She graduated from [[Midwood High School]] in Brooklyn, and attended [[Kirkland College]] (which later merged with [[Hamilton College (New York)|Hamilton College]]). She studied at the [[Rhode Island School of Design]] and received a BFA in painting in 1977. She also holds honorary doctorates from [[Pratt Institute]] and [[Dartmouth College]], and is a member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].

==Career==
Chast's subjects often deal with domestic and family life. In a 2006 interview with comedian [[Steve Martin]] for [[the New Yorker Festival]], Chast revealed that she enjoys drawing interior scenes — often involving lamps and accentuated wall paper — to serve as the backdrop for her comics. Her comics reflect a "conspiracy of inanimate objects", an expression she credits to her mother.

Her first ''New Yorker'' cartoon showed a small collection of "Little Things"—strangely-named, oddly-shaped small objects such as "chent", "spak", and "tiv". Chast's drawing style shuns conventional craft in her figure drawing, perspective, shading, etc.; this approach is similar to that of several other female cartoonists, notably [[Aline Kominsky-Crumb]] and [[Lynda Barry]]. A significant part of the humor in Chast's cartoons appears in the background and the corners of the frames.

Her ''New Yorker'' cartoons began as small black-and-white panels, but increasingly used more color and her work often appears over several pages. Her first cover for ''The New Yorker'' was on August 4, 1986, showing a lecturer in a white coat pointing to a family tree of ice cream.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rozchast.com/cartoons_newyorker.shtml Roz Chast website &gt; Cartoons &gt; New Yorker covers]&lt;/ref&gt;

She has written or illustrated more than a dozen books, including ''Unscientific Americans'', ''Parallel Universes'', ''Mondo Boxo'', ''Proof of Life on Earth'', ''The Four Elements'' and ''The Party After You Left: Collected Cartoons 1995–2003'' (Bloomsbury, 2004). In 2006, ''Theories of Everything: Selected Collected and Health-Inspected Cartoons, 1978–2006'' was published, collecting most of her cartoons from ''The New Yorker'' and other periodicals. One characteristic of her books is that the "author photo" is always a cartoon she draws of, presumably, herself. The title page, including the [[Library of Congress]] cataloging information, is also hand-lettered by Chast.

Her book ''[[Can't We Talk About Something More Pleasant?]]'' is a graphic memoir, combining cartoons, text, and photographs to tell the story of an only child helping her elderly parents navigate the end of their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kakutani |first=Michiko |date=5 May 2014 |title=Confronting the Inevitable, Graphically : A Memoir by Roz Chast, in Words and Cartoons |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/06/books/a-memoir-by-roz-chast-in-words-and-cartoons.html |newspaper=[[New York Times]] &gt; Books of The Times |location=[[New York City|New York]] |access-date=6 October 2016 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20151001063158/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/06/books/a-memoir-by-roz-chast-in-words-and-cartoons.html | archivedate=1 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She is represented by the Danese/Corey gallery in Chelsea, New York City.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.danesecorey.com/artists/roz-chast Roz Chast at Danese Corey]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
She lives in [[Ridgefield, Connecticut]] with her husband, humor writer [[Bill Franzen]]. They have two children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Werris |first1=Wendy |title=Telling It Like It Is: Roz Chast |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/authors/profiles/article/61923-telling-it-like-it-is-roz-chast.html |website=PW |publisher=[[Publishers Weekly]] |accessdate=6 October 2016 |date=Apr 18, 2014 | quote=''A version of this article appeared in the 04/21/2014 issue of Publishers Weekly under the headline: Telling It Like It Is: Roz Chast''}}&lt;/ref&gt;
