'''William Boyd''' "'''Bill'''" '''Watterson II''' (born July 5, 1958) is a former American cartoonist and the author of the [[comic strip]] ''[[Calvin and Hobbes]]'', which was [[Print syndication|syndicated]] from 1985 to 1995. Watterson stopped drawing ''Calvin and Hobbes'' at the end of 1995 with a short statement to newspaper editors and his readers that he felt he had achieved all he could in the medium. Watterson is known for his negative views on licensing and comic syndication, his efforts to expand and elevate the newspaper comic as an art-form, and his move back into [[Private sphere|private life]] after he stopped drawing ''Calvin and Hobbes''. Watterson was born in [[Washington, D.C.]] and grew up in [[Chagrin Falls]], [[Ohio]], whose suburban [[Midwestern United States]] setting was part of the inspiration for ''Calvin and Hobbes''.

==Early life==
Bill Watterson was born in [[Washington, D.C.]], the United States, where his father James G. Watterson (1932–2016) worked as a [[patent attorney]]. The family relocated to [[Chagrin Falls]], [[Ohio]] in 1965 when Watterson was six because his mother Kathryn wanted to be closer to her family and felt that the small town was a good place to raise children.

Watterson drew his first cartoon at age eight, and spent much time in childhood [[social isolation|alone]], drawing and cartooning. This continued through his school years,&lt;ref name="short biography"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://ignatz.brinkster.net/cbillbio.html | title= A Short Biography of Bill Watterson | year= 2002 | accessdate= September 1, 2009 | first= Tim | last= Hulsizer | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090416091717/http://ignatz.brinkster.net/cbillbio.html | archivedate= April 16, 2009 | df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; during which time he discovered comic strips such as ''[[Pogo (comics)|Pogo]]'', ''[[Krazy Kat]]'', and [[Charles M. Schulz|Charles Schulz]]' ''[[Peanuts]]'' which subsequently inspired and influenced his desire to become a professional cartoonist.&lt;ref&gt;Watterson, Bill (1995). ''The Calvin &amp; Hobbes Tenth Anniversary Book'', p. 17. Andrews McMeel, Kansas City, Missouri. {{ISBN|0-7407-7794-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On one occasion when he was in fourth grade, he wrote a letter to Charles Schulz, who responded — to Watterson's surprise — making a big impression on him at the time. His parents encouraged him in his artistic pursuits. Later, they recalled him as a "conservative child" — imaginative, but "not in a fantasy way", and certainly nothing like the character of Calvin that he later created.&lt;ref&gt;Gene Williams (August 30, 1987), [http://ignatz.brinkster.net/calterego.html "Calvin's Other Alter Ego"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522191711/http://ignatz.brinkster.net/calterego.html |date=May 22, 2013 }}, ''Cleveland Plain Dealer''.&lt;/ref&gt; Watterson found avenues for his cartooning talents throughout primary and secondary school, creating high school-themed super hero comics with his friends and contributing cartoons and art to the school newspaper and yearbook.&lt;ref name=martell&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q6wHaqIDzDEC |title=Looking for Calvin and Hobbes: The Unconventional Story of Bill Watterson and His Revolutionary Comic Strip |last=Martell |first=Nevin |date=2009-10-05 |publisher=A&amp;C Black |isbn=9780826429841 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|20–3}}

From 1976 to 1980, Watterson attended [[Kenyon College]] and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in [[political science]]. He had already decided upon a career in cartooning, but he felt that his studies would help him move into editorial cartooning. While at college, he continued to develop his art skills; during his [[sophomore]] year, he painted [[Michelangelo]]'s ''[[Creation of Adam]]'' on the ceiling of his dorm room.&lt;ref&gt;Bill Watterson (May 20, 1990), [http://ignatz.brinkster.net/cglimpsed.html "Some Thoughts on the Real World by One Who Glimpsed It and Fled"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130708132258/http://ignatz.brinkster.net/cglimpsed.html |date=July 8, 2013 }}, ''Kenyon College Commencement Speech''&lt;/ref&gt; He also contributed cartoons to the college newspaper, some of which included the original "Spaceman Spiff" cartoons.{{efn|Many of these early cartoons are archived online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Rare Bill Watterson Art|url= http://ignatz.brinkster.net/cbillart.html | publisher = Ignatz |accessdate= June 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Later, when Watterson was creating names for the characters in his comic strip, he decided upon Calvin (after the Protestant reformer [[John Calvin]]) and Hobbes (after the social philosopher [[Thomas Hobbes]]), allegedly as a "tip of the hat" to the [[political science]] department at Kenyon. In ''The Complete Calvin and Hobbes'', Watterson stated that Calvin is named for "a 16th-century theologian who believed in [[predestination]]," and Hobbes for "a 17th-century philosopher with a dim view of human nature."

Watterson wrote a brief, tongue-in-cheek autobiography in the late 1980s.&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://ignatz.brinkster.net/cautobio.html| title=The Brief Tongue-in-Cheek Autobiography of Bill Watterson| author=Bill Watterson| accessdate=May 18, 2008| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705120756/http://ignatz.brinkster.net/cautobio.html| archivedate=July 5, 2008| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Early work===
Watterson was inspired by the work of ''[[Cincinnati Enquirer]]'' [[political cartoonist]] [[Jim Borgman]], a 1976 graduate of Kenyon College, who currently draws ''[[Zits (comic strip)|Zits]]'', and decided to try to follow the same career path as Borgman, who in turn offered support and encouragement to the aspiring artist. Watterson graduated in 1980 and was hired on a trial basis at the ''[[Cincinnati Post]]'', a competing paper of the ''Enquirer''. Watterson quickly discovered that the job was full of unexpected challenges which prevented him from performing his duties to the standards set for him.  Not the least of these challenges was his unfamiliarity with the Cincinnati political scene, as he had never resided in or near the city, having grown up in the [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]] area and attending college in central Ohio. The ''Post'' abruptly fired Watterson before his contract was up.&lt;ref name = "honk"&gt;{{Citation | url = http://home3.inet.tele.dk/stadil/interw.htm | publisher = Tele | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060218193101/http://home3.inet.tele.dk/stadil/interw.htm | archivedate =February 18, 2006 | title= Bill Watterson, the creator of Calvin and Hobbes on cartooning, syndicates, Garfield, Charles Schulz, and editors | newspaper = Honk Magazine | issue = 2 | year = 1987 | accessdate = March 17, 2006 | first = Andrew | last = Christie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He then joined a small advertising agency and worked there for four years as a designer, creating grocery advertisements while also working on his own projects, including development of his own cartoon strip and contributions to ''Target: The Political Cartoon Quarterly''.&lt;ref name= "groc"&gt;{{Cite book | title = The Complete Calvin and Hobbes | chapter = Introduction| page = 491 | volume = 1 | publisher=Andrew McMeel | author-link = Bill Watterson | isbn = 0-7407-4847-5 | year = 2005 | first =Bill | last = Watterson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a freelance artist, Watterson has drawn other works for various merchandise, including album art for his brother's band, calendars, clothing graphics, educational books, magazine covers, posters, and post cards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The various other works drawn by Watterson.|url=http://www.platypuscomix.net/otherpeople/watterson.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Calvin and Hobbes'' and rise to success===
Watterson has said that he works for personal fulfillment. As he told the graduating class of 1990 at Kenyon College, "It's surprising how hard we'll work when the work is done just for ourselves." ''Calvin and Hobbes'' was first published on November 18, 1985. In ''Calvin and Hobbes Tenth Anniversary Book'', he wrote&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Watterson| first = Bill|title = Calvin and Hobbes Tenth Anniversary Book| publisher = Andrews and McMeel| year = 1995|page = 21| isbn = 0-8362-0438-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; that his influences included [[Charles M. Schulz|Charles Schulz]]'s ''[[Peanuts]]'', [[Walt Kelly]]'s ''[[Pogo (comics)|Pogo]]'', and [[George Herriman]]'s ''[[Krazy Kat]]''. Watterson wrote the introduction to the first volume of ''The Komplete Kolor Krazy Kat''. Watterson's style also reflects the influence of [[Winsor McCay]]'s ''[[Little Nemo|Little Nemo in Slumberland]]''.&lt;ref name="bob"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zompist.com/bob8.html
| title=Winsor McCay: Little Nemo; Dreams of the Rarebit Fiend| publisher=Bob's Comics Reviews|date=November 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="incr"&gt;{{Cite book| url=http://ignatz.brinkster.net/cslumberland.html| title=The Best of Little Nemo in Slumberland| chapter=An Incredible Ride To the End: An appreciation by Bill Watterson| page=195| publisher=Stewart, Tabori, &amp; Chang| accessdate=March 17, 2006| isbn=1-55670-647-2| year=1987| author=Winsor McCay, Richard Marschall| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051125034527/http://ignatz.brinkster.net/cslumberland.html| archivedate=November 25, 2005| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like many artists, Watterson incorporated elements of his life, interests, beliefs, and values into his work—for example, his hobby as a cyclist,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last = Watterson| first = Bill|title = Calvin and Hobbes Tenth Anniversary Book| publisher = Andrews and McMeel| year = 1995|page = 173|isbn = 0-8362-0438-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; memories of his own father's speeches about "building character", and his views on merchandising and corporations. Watterson's cat Sprite very much inspired the personality and physical features of [[Hobbes (Calvin and Hobbes)|Hobbes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Watterson| first = Bill|title = Calvin and Hobbes Tenth Anniversary Book| publisher = Andrews and McMeel
|year = 1995|page = 22|isbn = 0-8362-0438-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Watterson spent much of his career trying to change the climate of newspaper comics. He believed that the artistic value of comics was being undermined, and that the space which they occupied in newspapers continually decreased, subject to arbitrary whims of shortsighted publishers. Furthermore, he opined that art should not be judged by the medium for which it is created (i.e., there is no [[High culture|"high" art]] or [[Low culture|"low" art]]—just art).&lt;ref name="tenthanniversary"&gt;{{Cite book| title=The Calvin and Hobbes Tenth Anniversary Book| author=Bill Watterson
| year=1995| page=208| publisher=Andrews McMeel| isbn=0-8362-0438-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fight against merchandising his characters===
For years, Watterson battled against pressure from publishers to merchandise his work, something that he felt would cheapen his comic.&lt;ref name="cheapcomic"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://hobbes.ncsa.uiuc.edu/comics.html | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060210115506/http://hobbes.ncsa.uiuc.edu/comics.html | archivedate=February 10, 2006| title=The Cheapening of the Comics| author=Bill Watterson| work=Festival of Cartoon Art, Ohio State University| date=October 27, 1989| accessdate=March 17, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He refused to merchandise his creations on the grounds that displaying ''Calvin and Hobbes'' images on commercially sold mugs, stickers, and T-shirts would devalue the characters and their personalities. Watterson said that Universal kept putting pressure on him and said that he had signed his contract without fully perusing it because, as a new artist, he was happy to find a syndicate willing to give him a chance (two syndicates had denied Watterson). He added that the contract was so one-sided that, if Universal really wanted to, they could license his characters against his will, and could even fire him but continue ''Calvin and Hobbes'' with a new artist. Watterson's position eventually won out and he was able to renegotiate his contract so that he would receive all rights to his work, but later added that the licensing fight exhausted him and contributed to the need for a nine-month sabbatical in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Watterson| first = Bill|title = Calvin and Hobbes Tenth Anniversary Book| publisher = Andrews and McMeel| year = 1995|page = 10|isbn = 0-8362-0438-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Watterson's efforts, many unofficial knockoffs have been found, including items that depict Calvin and Hobbes consuming alcohol or Calvin urinating on a logo. Watterson has said, "Only thieves and vandals have made money on ''Calvin and Hobbes'' merchandise."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Watterson| first = Bill|title = Calvin and Hobbes Tenth Anniversary Book| publisher = Andrews and McMeel| year = 1995|page = 12|isbn = 0-8362-0438-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are some very rare official T-shirts, posters and a teaching dictionary that exist and are authorized.

===Changing the format of the Sunday strip===
Watterson was critical of the prevailing format for the [[Sunday strip|Sunday comic strip]] that was in place when he began drawing (and still is, to varying degrees). The typical layout consists of three rows with eight total squares, which take up half a page if published with its normal size. Some newspapers are restricted with space for their Sunday features and reduce the size of the strip. One of the more common ways is to cut out the top two panels, which Watterson believed forced him to waste the space on throwaway jokes that did not always fit the strip. While he was set to return from his first sabbatical, Watterson discussed with his syndicate a new format for ''Calvin and Hobbes'' that would enable him to use his space more efficiently and would almost require the papers to publish it as a half-page. Universal agreed that they would sell the strip as the half-page and nothing else, which garnered anger from papers and criticism for Watterson from both editors and some of his fellow cartoonists (whom he described as "unnecessarily hot tempered"). Eventually, Universal compromised and agreed to offer papers a choice between the full half-page or a reduced-sized version to alleviate concerns about the size issue. Watterson conceded that this caused him to lose space in many papers, but he said that, in the end, it was a benefit because he felt that he was giving the papers' readers a better strip for their money and editors were free not to run ''Calvin and Hobbes'' at their own risk. He added that he was not going to apologize for drawing a popular feature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book
|last = Watterson| first = Bill| title = Calvin and Hobbes Tenth Anniversary Book| publisher = Andrews and McMeel| year = 1995| page = 14| isbn = 0-8362-0438-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===End of ''Calvin and Hobbes''===
Watterson announced the end of ''Calvin and Hobbes'' on November 9, 1995, with the following letter to newspaper editors:

{{bquote|
Dear Reader:&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I will be stopping ''Calvin and Hobbes'' at the end of the year. This was not a recent or an easy decision, and I leave with some sadness. My interests have shifted, however, and I believe I've done what I can do within the constraints of daily deadlines and small panels. I am eager to work at a more thoughtful pace, with fewer artistic compromises. I have not yet decided on future projects, but my relationship with Universal Press Syndicate will continue.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
That so many newspapers would carry ''Calvin and Hobbes'' is an honor I'll long be proud of, and I've greatly appreciated your support and indulgence over the last decade. Drawing this comic strip has been a privilege and a pleasure, and I thank you for giving me the opportunity.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Sincerely,&lt;br/&gt;
Bill Watterson}}

The last strip of ''Calvin and Hobbes'' was published on December 31, 1995.

==After ''Calvin and Hobbes''==
Since the conclusion of ''Calvin and Hobbes'', Watterson has taken up painting, at one point drawing landscapes of the woods with his father. He has kept away from the public eye and has given no indication of resuming the strip, creating new works based on the strip's characters, or embarking on new commercial projects, though he has published several ''Calvin and Hobbes'' anthologies. He does not sign autographs or license his characters, staying true to his stated principles. In previous years, Watterson was known to sneak autographed copies of his books onto the shelves of the Fireside Bookshop, a family-owned bookstore in his hometown of [[Chagrin Falls]], [[Ohio]]. He ended this practice after discovering that some of the autographed books were being sold online for high prices.&lt;ref name="2005 AP story"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.projo.com/yourlife/content/projo_20051024_calhobbes.885b8c7.html | title = Calvin and Hobbes creator stays out of view, even at debut of collected strips | date=October 24, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Watterson rarely gives interviews or makes public appearances. His lengthiest interviews include the cover story in ''The Comics Journal'' No. 127 in February 1989,&lt;ref name="The Comics Journal No. 127, February 1989"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.tcj.com/the-comics-journal-no-127-february-1989/ | title = The Comics Journal No. 127, February 1989: Featuring an interview with Bill Watterson; an essay by Ralph Steadman; the Brad Holland sketchbook|publisher=Tcj.com | date=November 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; an interview that appeared in a 1987 issue of ''[[Honk (magazine)|Honk Magazine]]'',&lt;ref name="honk"/&gt; and one in a 2015 Watterson exhibition catalogue.&lt;ref name="wp111"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/comic-riffs/wp/2015/03/10/read-heres-an-excerpt-from-bill-wattersons-rare-new-calvin-and-hobbes-interview/|title=Read: Here’s an excerpt from Bill Watterson’s rare new ‘Calvin and Hobbes’ interview|last=Cavna|first=Michael|date=March 10, 2015|work=Washington Post|accessdate=October 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 21, 1999, a short piece was published in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', written by Watterson to mark the forthcoming retirement of iconic ''[[Peanuts]]'' creator Charles Schulz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/dec/21/news/cl-45937|title=Drawn Into a Dark but Gentle World|last=Watterson|first=Bill|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=December 21, 1999|accessdate=December 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years that followed the end of ''Calvin and Hobbes'', many attempts were made to locate Watterson in his hometown of Chagrin Falls. Both ''[[The Plain Dealer]]'' and the ''[[Cleveland Scene]]'' sent reporters in 1998 and 2003, respectively, but were unable to locate him.

In 2004, Watterson and his wife Melissa bought a home in the Cleveland suburb of [[Cleveland Heights, Ohio]]. In 2005, they completed the move from their home in Chagrin Falls to their new residence.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://ignatz.brinkster.net/ctigerstrikes.html | first = Neely | last = Tucker | contribution = The Tiger Strikes Again | title = The Washington Post | date = October 4, 2005 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070814014701/http://ignatz.brinkster.net/ctigerstrikes.html | archivedate = August 14, 2007 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://ignatz.brinkster.net/cprivacy.html | first = Joe | last = Milicia | title = ''Calvin and Hobbes'' Creator Keeps Privacy | publisher = Associated Press | date = October 22, 2005 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110607004646/http://ignatz.brinkster.net/cprivacy.html | archivedate = June 7, 2011 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In or around 2003, [[Gene Weingarten]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' sent Watterson the first edition of the ''[[Barnaby (comic strip)|Barnaby]]'' book as an incentive, hoping to land an interview. Weingarten passed the book to Watterson's parents, along with a message, and declared that he would wait in his hotel for as long as it took Watterson to contact him. Watterson's editor Lee Salem called the next day to tell Weingarten that the cartoonist would not be coming.&lt;ref name=martell/&gt;{{rp|6}}

In October 2005, Watterson answered 15 questions submitted by readers.&lt;ref name="faniv"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.andrewsmcmeel.com/books/comics-and-humor/calvinandhobbes/pw_watterson.html| title=Fans From Around the World Interview Bill Watterson| publisher=Andrews McMeel| date=October 4, 2005| accessdate=March 17, 2006 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170405173424/http://www.andrewsmcmeel.com/books/comics-and-humor/calvinandhobbes/pw_watterson.html | archivedate=April 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2007, he wrote a review of ''Schulz and Peanuts'' in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', a biography of Charles Schulz.&lt;ref name="wsj"&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/public/article/SB119214690326956694.html| title=The Grief That Made 'Peanuts' Good| author=Bill Watterson| publisher=Wall Street Journal| date=October 12, 2007| accessdate=August 27, 2008| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150424105925/http://www.wsj.com/public/article/SB119214690326956694.html| archivedate=April 24, 2015| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2010, Watterson was interviewed by ''[[The Plain Dealer]]'' on the 15th anniversary of the end of ''Calvin and Hobbes''. Explaining his decision to discontinue the strip, he said,

This isn't as hard to understand as people try to make it. By the end of ten years, I'd said pretty much everything I had come there to say. It's always better to leave the party early. If I had rolled along with the strip's popularity and repeated myself for another five, ten, or twenty years, the people now "grieving" for ''Calvin and Hobbes'' would be wishing me dead and cursing newspapers for running tedious, ancient strips like mine instead of acquiring fresher, livelier talent. And I'd be agreeing with them. I think some of the reason ''Calvin and Hobbes'' still finds an audience today is because I chose not to run the wheels off it. I've never regretted stopping when I did.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cleveland.com/living/index.ssf/2010/02/bill_watterson_creator_of_belo.html|title=Bill Watterson, creator of beloved 'Calvin and Hobbes' comic strip looks back with no regrets|author=John Campanelli|newspaper=[[The Plain Dealer]]|date=February 1, 2010|accessdate=February 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 2008, he provided a foreword for the first book collection of [[Richard Thompson (cartoonist)|Richard Thompson]]'s ''[[Cul de Sac (comic strip)|Cul de Sac]]'' comic strip. In April 2011, a representative for [[Andrews McMeel]] received a package from a "William Watterson in Cleveland Heights, Ohio" which contained a 6″ × 8″ oil-on-board painting of ''[[Cul de Sac (comic strip)|Cul de Sac]]'' character Petey Otterloop, done by Watterson for the ''Team Cul de Sac'' fundraising project for [[Parkinson's disease]] in honor of Richard Thompson who was diagnosed in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://richardspooralmanac.blogspot.com/2009/07/some-news.html|title=Cul de Sac: Some News|last=Thompson|first=Richard|date=July 16, 2009|website=Cul de Sac|publisher=|access-date=2016-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Watterson's syndicate has since become [[Universal Uclick]], and they said that the painting was the first new artwork of his that the syndicate has seen since ''Calvin and Hobbes'' ended in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/comic-riffs/post/this-just-in-first-new-art-from-calvin-and-hobbes-creator-in-16-years-syndicate-says/2011/04/22/AF7l7NQE_blog.html|title=THIS JUST IN: First new art from ‘Calvin and Hobbes’ creator in 16 years, syndicate says|first=Michael|last=Cavna|date=April 22, 2011|work=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2013, the magazine ''[[Mental Floss]]'' published an interview with Watterson, only the second since the strip ended. Watterson again confirmed that he would not be revisiting ''Calvin and Hobbes'', and that he was satisfied with his decision. He also gave his opinion on the changes in the comic book industry and where it would be headed in the future:

Personally, I like paper and ink better than glowing pixels, but to each his own. Obviously the role of comics is changing very fast. On the one hand, I don't think comics have ever been more widely accepted or taken as seriously as they are now. On the other hand, the mass media is disintegrating, and audiences are atomizing. I suspect comics will have less widespread cultural impact and make a lot less money. I'm old enough to find all this unsettling, but the world moves on. All the new media will inevitably change the look, function, and maybe even the purpose of comics, but comics are vibrant and versatile, so I think they'll continue to find relevance one way or another. But they definitely won't be the same as what I grew up with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/53216/mental-floss-exclusive-our-interview-bill-watterson |title=Mental Floss Exclusive: Our Interview with Bill Watterson! |date=October 17, 2013|publisher=[[Mental Floss]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 2013 the documentary ''[[Dear Mr. Watterson]]'', exploring the cultural impact of ''Calvin and Hobbes'', was released.

On February 26, 2014, Watterson published his first cartoon since the end of ''Calvin and Hobbes'': a poster for the documentary ''[[Stripped (film)|Stripped]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gardner |first=Alan |url=http://dailycartoonist.com/index.php/2014/02/26/bill-watterson-provides-poster-art-for-stripped-documentary/ |title=Bill Watterson provides poster art for Stripped documentary The Daily Cartoonist |publisher=Dailycartoonist.com |date=February 26, 2014 |accessdate=June 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cohen|first=Nicole|title='Calvin &amp; Hobbes' Creator Pens His First Public Comic In 18 Years|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2014/02/27/283437272/calvin-hobbes-creator-pens-his-first-public-comic-in-18-years|work=NPR|accessdate=February 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Watterson co-authored ''The Art of Richard Thompson'' with Washington Post cartoonist [[Nick Galifianakis (cartoonist)|Nick Galifianakis]] and David Apatoff.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|asin=1449447953 |title=The Art of Richard Thompson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2014, three strips of ''[[Pearls Before Swine (comics)|Pearls Before Swine]]'' (published June 4, June 5, and June 6, 2014) featured guest illustrations by Watterson after mutual friend [[Nick Galifianakis (cartoonist)|Nick Galifianakis]] connected him and cartoonist [[Stephan Pastis]], who communicated via e-mail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Leopold |first=Todd |url=https://www.cnn.com/2014/06/08/showbiz/celebrity-news-gossip/watterson-pastis-calvin-hobbes-pearls-before-swine/index.html |title=How 'Calvin and Hobbes' met 'Pearls Before Swine' |publisher=CNN.com |date=June 8, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pastis likened this unexpected collaboration to getting "a glimpse of Bigfoot".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stephanpastis.wordpress.com/2014/06/07/ever-wished-that-calvin-and-hobbes-creator-bill-watterson-would-return-to-the-comics-page-well-he-just-did/ |title=Ever Wished That Calvin and Hobbes Creator Bill Watterson Would Return to the Comics Page?

It seemed like a perfect convergence", Watterson told the ''Washington Post''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/comic-riffs/wp/2014/06/26/this-just-in-bill-wattersons-pearls-before-swine-art-for-parkinsons-to-be-auctioned-in-august/ |title=THIS JUST IN: Bill Watterson’s ‘Pearls Before Swine’ art for Parkinson’s to be auctioned in August.; The Washington Post |publisher=The Washington Post |date=June 26, 2014 |accessdate=July 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The day that Stephan Pastis returned to his own strip, he paid tribute to Watterson by alluding to the final [[Calvin and Hobbes]] strip from December 31, 1995.

On November 5, 2014, a poster was unveiled, drawn by Watterson for the 2015 [[Angoulême International Comics Festival]] where he was awarded the Grand Prix in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.20minutes.fr/culture/1474575-20141105-createur-calvin-hobbes-devoile-affiche-festival-angouleme|title=Le créateur de Calvin et Hobbes dévoile son affiche pour le festival d’Angoulême|publisher=20 Minutes|date=November 5, 2014|accessdate=November 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 1, 2016 for [[April Fools' Day]], [[Berkeley Breathed]] posted on Facebook that Watterson had signed "the franchise over to my 'administration'". He then posted a comic with Calvin, Hobbes, and Opus all featured. The comic is signed by Watterson, though it remains to be seen how involved he actually was.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/berkeleybreathed/photos/a.114529165244512.10815.108793262484769/1169777789719639/?type=3&amp;theater|title=Calvin and Hobbes signed over to Berkeley Breathed=20 Minutes|date=April 1, 2016|accessdate=April 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Breathed posted another "Calvin County" strip featuring Calvin and Hobbes, also "signed" by Watterson on April 1, 2017, along with a fake ''[[The New York Times]]'' story ostensibly detailing the "merger" of the two strips.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.berkeleybreathed.com/calvin-county-watterson-breathed-mashup-the-time-warneraol-merger-of-the-comic-world|title=Calvin County: Watterson - Breathed Mash-up: The Time Warner/AOL Merger of the Comic World|last=Derkins|first=Susie|date=April 1, 2017|publisher=BERKELEY BREATHED|accessdate=April 1, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170404050114/http://www.berkeleybreathed.com/calvin-county-watterson-breathed-mashup-the-time-warneraol-merger-of-the-comic-world|archive-date=April 4, 2017|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Berkeley Breathed included Hobbes in a November 27, 2017 strip as a stand in for the character Steve Dallas.

===Exhibitions===
In 2001, [[Billy Ireland Cartoon Library &amp; Museum]] at [[Ohio State University]] mounted an exhibition of Watterson's [[Sunday strip]]s. He chose thirty-six of his favorites, displaying them with both the original drawing and the colored finished product, with most pieces featuring personal annotations. Watterson also wrote an accompanying essay that served as the foreword for the exhibit, called "Calvin and Hobbes: Sunday Pages 1985–1995". which opened on September 10, 2001. It was taken down in January 2002.  The accompanying published catalog had the same title.&lt;ref name="Calvin and Hobbes: Sunday Pages"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.andrewsmcmeel.com/books/detail?sku=9780740721359|title=Calvin and Hobbes: Sunday pages 1985-1995|publisher=Andrew Mcmeel|access-date=October 3, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170606055203/http://www.andrewsmcmeel.com/books/detail?sku=9780740721359|archive-date=June 6, 2017|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From March 22 to August 3, 2014, Watterson exhibited again at the Billy Ireland Cartoon Library &amp; Museum at Ohio State University.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = OSU cartoons | title = Exploring Calvin &amp; Hobbes | url = http://cartoons.osu.edu/events/exploring-calvin-and-hobbes/}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  In conjunction with this exhibition, Watterson also participated in an interview with the school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | date = March 20, 2014 | type = blog | contribution-url = http://library.osu.edu/blogs/cartoons/2014/03/20/new-interview-calvin-hobbes-creator-bill-watterson-and-cul-de-sac-creator-richard-thompson-talk-libraries-comics-and-the-creative-process-with-ohio-state/ | title = Cartoons | publisher = OSU Library | contribution = New interview: Calvin &amp; Hobbes creator Bill Watterson &amp; Cul de Sac creator Richard Thompson talk libraries, comics &amp; the creative process with Ohio State}}.&lt;/ref&gt; An exhibition catalog named ''Exploring Calvin and Hobbes'' was released with the exhibit. The book contained a lengthy interview with Bill Watterson, conducted by Jenny Robb, the curator of the museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/comic-riffs/wp/2015/03/09/bill-watterson-talks-this-is-why-you-must-read-the-new-exploring-calvin-and-hobbes-book/ |title=Bill Watterson talks: This is why you must read the new ‘Exploring Calvin and Hobbes’ book |last1=Cavna |first1=Michael |last2= |first2= |date=March 9, 2015 |website=The Washington Post |publisher=The Washington Post|access-date=May 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and honors==
Watterson was awarded the [[National Cartoonists Society]]'s Reuben Award in both 1986 and 1988.&lt;ref name="reub"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.reuben.org/reuben.html | title = Reuben Award Winners 1946–Present | publisher = National Cartoonist Society | accessdate = October 31, 2010 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120420080045/http://www.reuben.org/reuben.html | archivedate = April 20, 2012 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Watterson's second Reuben win made him the youngest cartoonist to be so honored, and only the sixth person to win twice, following [[Milton Caniff]], [[Charles Schulz]], [[Dik Browne]], [[Chester Gould]], and [[Jeff MacNelly]].  ([[Gary Larson]] is the only cartoonist to win a second Reuben since Watterson.)  In 2014, Watterson was awarded the Grand Prix at the [[Angoulême International Comics Festival]] for his body of work, becoming just the fourth non-European cartoonist to be so honored in the first 41 years of the event.
