'''Robert Dennis Crumb''' ({{IPAc-en|k|r|ʌ|m}}; born August 30, 1943) is an American cartoonist and musician who often signs his work '''R.&amp;nbsp;Crumb'''.  His work displays a nostalgia for [[Folklore of the United States|American folk culture]] of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and satire of contemporary American culture.

Crumb is a prolific artist and contributed to many of the seminal works of the [[underground comix]] movement in the 1960s, including being a founder of the first successful [[underground comix]] publication, ''[[Zap Comix]]'', contributing to all 16 issues. He was additionally contributing to the ''[[East Village Other]]'' and many other publications, including a variety of one-off and anthology comics. During this time, inspired by psychedelics and cartoons from the 1920s and 1930s, he introduced a wide variety of characters that became extremely popular, including [[Counterculture of the 1960s|countercultural]] icons [[Fritz the Cat]] and [[Mr. Natural (comics)|Mr. Natural]], and the images from his ''[[Keep on Truckin' (comics)|Keep on Truckin']]'' strip. Sexual themes abounded in all these projects, often shading into ''[[scatology|scatological]]'' and pornographic comics. In the mid-1970s, he contributed to the ''[[Arcade (comics magazine)|Arcade]]'' anthology; following the decline of the underground, he moved towards biographical and autobiographical subjects while refining his drawing style, a heavily [[Hatching|crosshatched]] pen-and-ink style inspired by late 19th- and early 20th-century cartooning. Much of his work appeared in a magazine he founded, ''[[Weirdo (comics)|Weirdo]]'' (1981–1993), which was one of the most prominent publications of the [[alternative comics]] era. As his career progressed, his comic work became more autobiographical.

In 1991, Crumb was inducted into the comic book industry's [[List of Eisner Award winners#The Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame|Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame]]. He is married to cartoonist [[Aline Kominsky-Crumb]], with whom he has frequently collaborated. Their daughter [[Sophie Crumb]] has also followed a cartooning career.

==Early life (1943–1966)==

Robert Crumb was born on August 30, 1943, in [[Philadelphia]] to a Catholic household{{sfn|Duncan|Smith|2013|p=158}} of English and [[Scottish people|Scottish]] ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;Crumb, Robert ''Crumb Family Comics''. Last Gasp, 1998. {{ISBN|0-86719-427-8}}, where he discusses his ancestry at length in a hand-written essay.&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Charles&amp;nbsp;V. Crumb, authored the book ''Training People Effectively'',{{sfn|Duncan|Smith|2013|p=158}} and was a Combat Illustrator for 20 years in the [[United States Marine Corps]].{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}  His mother Beatrice was a housewife who reportedly [[Substance abuse|abused]] diet pills and [[Substituted amphetamine|amphetamines]]. Charles and Beatrice's marriage was unhappy and the children were frequent witnesses to their parents' arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Crumb, Maxon|first1=edited by Maxon Crumb ; |title=Crumb Family Comics|date=1998|publisher=Last Gasp|location=San Francisco, Calif.|isbn=0867194278|pages=105, 129}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The couple had four other children: sons [[Charles Crumb|Charles]] Junior (1942–92) and [[Maxon Crumb|Maxon]] (b.&amp;nbsp;1944), both of whom suffered from mental illness; and daughters Carol (b.&amp;nbsp;1940) and Sandra (1946-1998).{{sfnm|1a1=Duncan|1a2=Smith|1y=2013|1p=158|2a1=Goldstein|2y=2013|2p=517}}&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Still-in-the-shadows-an-artist-in-his-own-right-2487551.php#page-3&lt;/ref&gt;  The family moved to [[Milford, Delaware]], when Crumb was twelve; there he was an average student whose teachers strongly discouraged him from cartooning.{{sfn|Maremaa|2004|p=29}}

Inspired by the works of [[Walt Kelly]], [[Fleischer Studios|Fleischer Brothers]] animation, and others, Crumb and his brothers drew their own comics.{{sfn|Duncan|Smith|2013|p=158}}  Crumb's cartooning developed as his older brother Charles pushed him and provided him with constant critical feedback on his work.  In 1958 the brothers self-published three issues of ''Foo'' in imitation of [[Harvey Kurtzman]]'s satirical ''[[Humbug (magazine)|Humbug]]'' and ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]''.  They sold them door-to-door with little success, souring the young Crumb on the comic-book business.{{sfn|Maremaa|2004|pp=29–30}}  At fifteen, Crumb became obsessed with collecting jazz and blues records from the 1920s to the 1940s.{{sfn|Duncan|Smith|2013|p=158}}  At age 16, he abandoned the Catholic faith.{{sfn|Goldstein|2013|p=517}}

==Career==

===Early work (1962–1966)===

Crumb's father gave him $40 when he left home after high school.{{sfn|Goldstein|2013|p=517}}  His first job, in 1962, was drawing novelty greeting cards for [[American Greetings]]{{sfn|Duncan|Smith|2013|p=159}} in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]].  He stayed with the company for four years, producing hundreds of cards for the company's Hi-Brow line; his superiors had him draw in a cuter style that was to leave a footprint on his work throughout his career.{{sfn|Maremaa|2004|p=30}}  In Cleveland he met a group of young [[bohemians]] such as [[Buzzy Linhart]], [[Liz Johnston]], and [[Harvey Pekar]]. Dissatisfied with greeting card work, he tried to sell cartoons to comic book companies, who showed little interest in his work.  In 1965, cartoonist [[Harvey Kurtzman]] printed some of Crumb's work in the humor magazine he edited, ''[[Help! (magazine)|Help!]]''.  Crumb moved to New York, intending to work with Kurtzman, but ''Help!'' ceased publication shortly after.  Crumb briefly illustrated bubblegum cards for [[Topps]] before returning to Cleveland and American Greetings.{{sfn|Duncan|Smith|2013|p=159}}

Crumb married Dana Morgan in 1964.  Nearly destitute, the couple traveled in Europe, during which Crumb continued to produce work for Kurtzman and American Greetings, and Dana stole food.{{sfn|Burgess|2000}}  The relationship was unstable as Crumb frequently went his own way, and he was not close to his son Jesse (b.&amp;nbsp;1965).{{sfn|Goldstein|2013|p=518}}
[[File:Fritz the Cat front cover.jpg|thumb|Front cover of ''Fritz the Cat''.]]
In 1965 and 1966 Crumb had a number of [[Fritz the Cat]] strips published in the men's magazine ''[[Cavalier (magazine)|Cavalier]]''.  Fritz had appeared in Crumb's work as early as the late 1950s; he was to become a hipster, scam artist, and bohemian until Crumb abandoned the character in 1969.{{sfn|Maremaa|2004|p=30}}

Crumb was becoming increasingly uncomfortable with his job and marriage when in June 1965 he began taking [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]], a [[psychedelic drug]] that was then still legal.  He had both good and [[bad trip]]s.  One bad trip left him in a muddled state for half a year, during which for a time he left Dana; the state ended when the two took a strong dose of the drug together in April 1966.{{sfn|Holm|2005|pp=46–47}}  Crumb created a number of his best-known characters during his years of LSD use, including [[Mr. Natural (comics)|Mr. Natural]], [[Angelfood McSpade]], and the [[Snoid]].{{sfn|Holm|2005|p=47}}

===''Zap'' and {{not a typo|underground comix}} (1967–1979)===

In January 1967 Crumb came across two friends in a bar who were about to leave for San Francisco; Crumb was interested in the work of San Francisco-based psychedelic poster artists, and on a whim asked if he could join them.{{sfn|Holm|2005|p=47}}  There, he contributed upbeat LSD-inspired countercultural work to [[Underground press|underground newspapers]].  The work was popular, and Crumb was flooded with requests, including to illustrate a full issue of [[Philadelphia]]'s ''[[Yarrowstalks]]''.{{sfn|Holm|2005|pp=47–48}}

Independent publisher [[Don Donahue]] invited Crumb to make a comic book; Crumb drew up two issues of ''[[Zap Comix]]'', and Donahue published the first{{sfn|Holm|2005|pp=47–48}} in February 1968 under the publisher name [[Apex Novelties]].  Crumb had difficulty at first finding retailers who would stock it, and at first his wife took to selling the first run herself out of a baby carriage.{{sfn|Harvey|1996|p=195}}

Crumb met cartoonist [[S. Clay Wilson]], an art school graduate who saw himself as a rebel against middle-class American values and whose comics were violent and grotesque.  Wilson's attitude inspired Crumb to give up the idea of the cartoonist-as-entertainer and to focus on comics as open, uncensored self-expression; in particular, his work soon became sexually explicit, as in the pornographic ''Snatch'' he and Wilson produced late in 1968.{{sfn|Harvey|1996|p=195}}

The second issue of ''Zap'' appeared in June with contributions from Wilson and poster artists [[Victor Moscoso]] and [[Rick Griffin]].  In December, Donahue published the still-unreleased issue as {{No.}}0 and a new third issue with [[Gilbert Shelton]] joining the roster of regulars.{{sfn|Harvey|1996|p=195}} ''Zap'' was financially successful, and developed a market for underground comix.

Crumb was a prolific cartoonist in the late 1960s and early 1970s; at his peak point of output he produced 320 pages over two years.{{sfn|Goldstein|2013|p=517}}  He produced much of his best-known work then,{{sfn|Duncan|Smith|2013|p=160}} including his ''[[Keep on Truckin' (comics)|Keep on Truckin']]'' strip, and strips featuring characters such as the bohemian [[Fritz the Cat]], spiritual guru [[Mr. Natural (comics)|Mr. Natural]], and oversexed African-American stereotype [[Angelfood McSpade]].&lt;ref&gt;Dowd, Douglas B.; Hignite, Todd (2006). ''Strips, Toons, And Bluesies: Essays In Comics And Culture''. New York: Princeton Architectural Press, pp. 76–79. {{ISBN|978-1-56898-621-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, he launched a series of solo titles, including ''Despair'', ''Uneeda'' (both published by Print Mint in 1969), ''Big Ass Comics'', ''R. Crumb's Comics and Stories'', ''Motor City Comics'' (all published by [[Rip Off Press]] in 1969), ''Home Grown Funnies'' ([[Kitchen Sink Press]], 1971) and ''Hytone Comix'' ([[Apex Novelties]], 1971), in addition to founding the pornographic anthologies ''Jiz'' and ''Snatch'' (both Apex Novelties, 1969).&lt;ref name="Sabin-92"&gt;Sabin, Roger (1996).

===''Weirdo'' (1980–1993)===

While meditating in 1980 Crumb conceived of a magazine with a [[Low culture|lowbrow]] aesthetic inspired by [[punk zine]]s, ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'', and men's magazines of the 1940s and 1950s.{{sfn|Holm|2005|p=83}}  From 1981 Crumb edited the first eight issues of the twenty-eight issue run of ''[[Weirdo (comics)|Weirdo]]'', published by [[Last Gasp]];{{sfn|Holm|2005|p=82}} his contributions and tastes determined the contents of the later issues as well, edited by [[Peter Bagge]] until {{No.}}16, and Aline for the remainder of the run.{{sfn|Holm|2005|p=83}}  The magazine featured cartoonists new and old, and had a mixed response; [[Art Spiegelman]], who co-edited the slicker ''[[Raw (magazine)|Raw]]'', called it a "piece of shit", and Crumb's [[Photonovel#Fumetti|fumetti]] was so unpopular that it has never appeared in Crumb collections.{{sfn|Holm|2005|pp=83–85}}

===Later life (1994–present)===
The Crumbs moved into a house in southeastern France in 1991, which is said to have been financed by the sale of six Crumb sketchbooks.{{sfn|Holm|2005|p=xx}}  The [[Terry Zwigoff]]-directed ''[[Crumb (film)|Crumb]]'' documentary appeared in 1994{{sfn|Holm|2005|p=97}}—a project on which Zwigoff had been working since 1985.{{sfn|Holm|2005|p=82}} The film won several major critical accolades.

From 1987 to 2005 [[Fantagraphics Books]] published the seventeen-volume ''[[The Complete Crumb Comics|Complete Crumb Comics]]''{{sfn|Holm|2005|p=85}} and ten volumes of sketches.  Crumb (as "R. Crumb") contributes regularly to ''[[Mineshaft (magazine)|Mineshaft]]'' magazine, which, since 2009, has been serializing "Excerpts From R. Crumb's Dream Diary".&lt;ref name="Mineshaft Magazine Homepage"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mineshaftmagazine.com/index.html |title=Update |first=Gioia |last=Palmieri |publisher=Mineshaft Magazine |accessdate=December 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, after four years of work, Crumb produced ''[[The Book of Genesis (comics)|The Book of Genesis]]'', an unabridged illustrated [[graphic novel]] version of the biblical [[Book of Genesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Graphic Books Best-Seller List |first=George Gene |last=Gustines |authorlink=George Gustines |url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/10/23/graphic-books-best-seller-list-12/?scp=2&amp;sq=Genesis%20Crumb&amp;st=cse |format=book review |agency= |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |publisher= |isbn= |issn= |oclc= |doi= |id= |date=October 23, 2009 |accessdate=October 27, 2009 |quote= |ref=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2009/10/18/arts/20091018-SALK_index.html?ref=design |title=R.

In January 2015, Crumb was asked to submit a cartoon to the left-wing magazine ''[[Libération]]'' as a tribute for the [[Charlie Hebdo shooting]]. He sent a drawing titled "A Cowardly Cartoonist," depicting an illustration of the backside of Crumb's friend Mohamid Bakshi, while referencing the prophet [[Muhammad]], founder of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://observer.com/2015/01/legendary-cartoonist-robert-crumb-on-the-massacre-in-paris "Legendary Cartoonist Robert Crumb on the Massacre in Paris,"] ''New York Observer'' (10 January 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2015/01/12/a-kind-of-sleaze/ "A Kind of Sleaze" ''The Paris Review'' 12 January 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Professional collaborations===
A friend of comic book writer [[Harvey Pekar]], Crumb illustrated over 30 stories of Pekar's in the award-winning comic book series ''[[American Splendor]]'', primarily in the first eight issues (1976-1983).&lt;ref&gt;McArdle, Terence. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/12/AR2010071202413.html "Harvey Pekar dead: American Splendor comic writer was 70"] ''Washington Post''. July 13, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Crumb collaborates with his wife, [[Aline Kominsky-Crumb]], on many strips and comics, including ''[[Dirty Laundry Comics]]'', ''[[Self-Loathing Comics]]'', and work published in ''[[The New Yorker]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Jonathan.

Crumb's work also appeared in ''Nasty Tales'', a 1970s British underground comic. The publishers were acquitted in a celebrated 1972 obscenity trial at the [[Old Bailey]] in London; the first such case involving a comic. Giving evidence at the trial, one of the defendants said of Crumb: "He is the most outstanding, certainly the most interesting, artist to appear from the underground, and this (Dirty Dog) is [[François Rabelais|Rabelaisian]] satire of a very high order. He is using coarseness quite deliberately in order to get across a view of social hypocrisy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.funtopia.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/friends/nastytalestrial2.htm |title=Nasty Tales Trial 2 |publisher=funtopia.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk |date=February 9, 1973 |accessdate=January 14, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008023623/http://www.funtopia.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/friends/nastytalestrial2.htm |archivedate=October 8, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"International Times" journal, {{no.|147}}, February 9, 1973, {{p.|17|20}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, Crumb allowed his artwork to be used as pictorial rubber stamp designs by [[Top Drawer Rubber Stamp Company]], a collaboration between cartoonist [[Art Spiegelman]], publisher [[Françoise Mouly]]. and people living at [[Quarry Hill Creative Center]] in [[Rochester, Vermont]]. R. Crumb's imagery proved to be some of the most popular designs produced by this avant-garde pictorial stamp company.&lt;ref&gt;"Rubberstampmadness" magazine.&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

In the 1980s and 1990s, Crumb illustrated a number of writer [[Charles Bukowski]] stories, including the collection ''[[The Captain Is Out to Lunch and the Sailors Have Taken Over the Ship]]'' and the story "[[Bring Me Your Love (short story)|Bring Me Your Love]]."&lt;ref&gt;Popova, Maria.

In 1984-5 Crumb produced a series of illustrations for the tenth anniversary edition of [[Edward Abbey]]'s environmental themed novel ''[[The Monkey Wrench Gang]]'', published in 1985 by Dream Garden Press of Salt Lake City. Many of these illustrations also appeared in a 1987 Monkey Wrench Gang calendar, and remain available on T-shirts.

Crumb's collaboration with [[David Zane Mairowitz]], the illustrated, part-comic biography and bibliography ''[[Introducing Kafka]]'' (1993), a.k.a. ''Kafka for Beginners'', is one of his less sexual- and satire-oriented, comparably highbrow works. It is well-known and favorably received, and due to its popularity was republished as ''R. Crumb's Kafka''.

A theatrical production based on his work was produced at [[Duke University]] in the early 1990s. Directed by Johnny Simons, and co-starring [[Avner Eisenberg]] and [[Nicholas de Wolff]], the development of the play was supervised by Crumb, who also served as set designer, drawing larger-than-life representations of some of his most famous characters all over the floors and walls of the set.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

===Musical projects===

Crumb has frequently drawn comics about his musical interests in [[blues]], [[Country music|country]], [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]], [[cajun]], French [[Bal-musette]], [[jazz]], [[big band]] and [[swing music]] from the 1920s and 1930s, and they also heavily influenced the soundtrack choices for his band mate Zwigoff's 1994 ''Crumb'' documentary.  In 2006, he prepared, compiled and illustrated the book ''R. Crumb's Heroes of Blues, Jazz &amp; Country'', with accompanying CD, which derived from three series of [[trading card]]s originally published in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2006/oct/08/music Danny Baker, "What a feast of Crumbs", ''The Observer'', 8 October 2006]. Retrieved December 17, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Crumb was the leader of the band [[R. Crumb &amp; His Cheap Suit Serenaders]], for which he sang lead vocals, wrote several songs and played banjo and other instruments. Crumb often plays mandolin with [[Eden and John's East River String Band]] and has drawn three covers for them: 2009's ''Drunken Barrel House Blues'', 2008's ''Some Cold Rainy Day'', and 2011's ''Be Kind To A Man When He's Down'' on which he plays [[mandolin]]. With Dominique Cravic, he founded "Les Primitifs du Futur"—a French-style band based on ''[[Bal-musette|musette]]''&amp;nbsp;/ folk, jazz and blues—and played on its 2000 album ''World Musette''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allmusic.com/album/world-musette-r861093 World Musette – Les Primitifs du Futur : Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards : AllMusic&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; He also provided the [[cover art]] for this and other albums.

Crumb has released CDs anthologizing old original performances gleaned from collectible [[Gramophone record#78 rpm disc developments|78-rpm]] [[Gramophone record|phonograph record]]s.  His ''That's What I Call Sweet Music'' was released in 1999 and ''Hot Women: Women Singers from the Torrid Regions'' in 2009.  Crumb drew the cover art for these CDs as well.

In 2013, Crumb played mandolin with the [[Eden and John's East River String Band]] on their album ''Take A Look at That Baby'' and also took part in the accompanying [[music video]].

===Album covers===

[[File:Cheapthrills.jpeg|thumb|Crumb cover artwork for the 1968 [[Big Brother and the Holding Company]] album ''[[Cheap Thrills (Big Brother and the Holding Company album)|Cheap Thrills]]''.]]

Crumb has illustrated many album covers, including most prominently ''[[Cheap Thrills (Big Brother and the Holding Company album)|Cheap Thrills]]'' by [[Big Brother and the Holding Company]] and the [[compilation album]] ''[[The Music Never Stopped: Roots of the Grateful Dead]]''.

Between 1974 and 1984, Crumb drew at least 17 album covers for Yazoo Records/Blue Goose Records, including those of the Cheap Suit Serenaders.  He also created the revised logo and record label designs of Blue Goose Records that were used from 1974 onward.

In 1992 and 1993, Robert Crumb was involved in a project by Dutch formation [[The Beau Hunks]] and provided the cover art for both their albums ''The Beau Hunks play the original Laurel &amp; Hardy music'' 1 and 2. He also illustrated the albums' booklets.

In 2009, Crumb drew the artwork for a 10-CD anthology of French traditional music compiled by [[Guillaume Veillet]] for [[Frémeaux &amp; Associés]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fremeaux.com/index.php?page=shop.product_details&amp;category_id=128&amp;flypage=shop.flypage&amp;product_id=1149&amp;option=com_virtuemart&amp;Itemid=0 |title=World music France : une anthologie des musiques traditionnelles Enregistrements realises entre 1900 et 2009 (10 cds) – Frémeaux &amp; Associés éditeur , La Librairie Sonore |publisher=Fremeaux.com |date= |accessdate=January 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, he created three artworks for Christopher King's ''Aimer Et Perdre: To Love And To Lose Songs, 1917–1934''&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tompkinssquare.com/archives/197 Aimer et Perdre : To Love &amp; To Lose Songs, 1917–1934 « tompkinssquare.com&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and, in 2011, he once again played mandolin on an Eden and John's East River String Band album (''Be Kind to a Man When He's Down'') for which he also created the album cover artwork.

== Style ==

As told by Crumb in his [[Crumb (film)|biographical film]], his artwork was very conventional and traditional in the beginning. His earlier work shows this more restrained style. In Crumb's own words, it was a lengthy drug trip on [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] that "left him fuzzy for two months" and led to him adopting the surrealistic, [[psychedelic art|psychedelic]] style for which he has become known.

Crumb has been acclaimed for his attention to detail and satirical edge, but has also generated a significant amount of controversy for his graphic and very disturbing portrayals of sexuality and psychology. There exists a feminist backlash against his comics because they became more "violently misogynistic, as he graphically poured what were essentially his masturbatory fantasies onto the printed page.  Women were raped, dismembered, mutilated, and murdered, sometimes all at once."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.popmatters.com/feature/no-girls-allowed-crumb-and-the-comix-counterculture/ No Girls Allowed - Crumb and the Comix Counterculture]", ''PopMatters''&lt;/ref&gt;

A peer in the underground comics field, [[Victor Moscoso]], commented about his first impression of Crumb's work, in the mid-1960s, before meeting Crumb in person: "I couldn't tell if it was an old man drawing young, or a young man drawing old."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcj.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=267&amp;Itemid=48 ''The Comics Journal'' #246]&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Crumb's cartooning style has drawn on the work of cartoon artists from earlier generations, including [[Billy DeBeck]] ([[Barney Google and Snuffy Smith|Barney Google]]), [[C. E. Brock]] (an old story book illustrator), [[Gene Ahern]]'s comic strips, [[Basil Wolverton]] ([[Powerhouse Pepper]]), [[George Baker (cartoonist)|George Baker]] ([[Sad Sack]]), [[Ub Iwerks]]'s characters for animation, [[Friz Freleng|Isadore Freleng]]'s drawings for the early [[Merrie Melodies]] and [[Looney Tunes]] of the 1930s, [[Sidney Smith (cartoonist)|Sidney Smith]] (''[[The Gumps]]''), [[Rube Goldberg]], [[E. C. Segar]] ([[Popeye]]) and [[Bud Fisher]] ([[Mutt and Jeff]]). Crumb has cited [[Carl Barks]], who illustrated Disney's "Donald Duck" comic books and [[John Stanley (cartoonist)|John Stanley]] ([[Little Lulu]]) as formative influences on his narrative approach, as well as [[Harvey Kurtzman]] of [[Mad (magazine)|Mad]] Magazine fame.

Crumb has also cited his extensive LSD use as a factor that led him to develop his unique style.&lt;ref&gt;The R. Crumb Coffee Table Art Book'' at p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT08&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/05/arts/design/05crum.html Mr. Natural Goes to the Museum], September 5, 2008, [[The New York Times]]&lt;/ref&gt;

After issues 0 and 1 of Zap, Crumb began working with others, of whom the first was [[S. Clay Wilson]].  Crumb said, about when he first saw Wilson's work "The content was something like I'd never seen before,&amp;nbsp;... a nightmare vision of hell-on-earth&amp;nbsp;..."  And "Suddenly my own work seemed insipid&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref&gt;''The Art of S. Clay Wilson'', Ten Speed Press, 2006, p. vii.&lt;/ref&gt;

Crumb remains a prominent figure, as both artist and influence, within the [[alternative comics]] milieu.  He is hailed as a genius by such comic book talents as [[Jaime Hernandez]], [[Daniel Clowes]], and [[Chris Ware]].  In the fall of 2008, the [[Institute of Contemporary Art, Philadelphia|Institute of Contemporary Art]] in [[Philadelphia]] hosted a major exhibition of his work, which was favorably reviewed in ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;ref name="NYT08"/&gt; and in ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philly.com/philly/entertainment/music/20080831_Out_from_underground.html Out from underground], August 31, 2008, ''Philadelphia Inquirer''&lt;/ref&gt;

With [[Jack Kirby]], [[Will Eisner]], [[Harvey Kurtzman]], [[Gary Panter]], and [[Chris Ware]], Crumb was among the artists honored in the exhibition "Masters of American Comics" at the [[Jewish Museum (Manhattan)|Jewish Museum]] in New York City, from September 16, 2006 to January 28, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thejewishmuseum.org/exhibitions/Comics |title=Exhibitions: Masters of American Comics |publisher=The Jewish Museum |date= |accessdate=August 10, 2010 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tDGL3Ci7?url=http://www.thejewishmuseum.org/exhibitions/Comics |archivedate=October 3, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}. .&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kimmelman, Michael.

In 2017, Crumb's original cover art for the 1969 "[[Fritz the Cat]]" collection published by Ballantine sold at auction for $717,000, the highest sale price to that point for any piece of American cartoon art.&lt;ref&gt;[[Milton Griepp|Griepp, Milton]], [https://icv2.com/articles/news/view/37554/new-record-price-american-comic-art "NEW RECORD PRICE FOR AMERICAN COMIC ART: Robert Crumb's Fritz the Cat,"] ICv2 (May 19, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the media ==

In addition to numerous brief television reports, there are at least three television or theatrical documentaries dedicated to Crumb.

* Prior to the 1972 release of the film version of ''[[Fritz the Cat (film)|Fritz the Cat]]'', Austrian journalist Georg Stefan Troller ([[:de:Georg Stefan Troller]]) interviewed Crumb for a thirty-minute documentary entitled ''Comics und Katerideen'' on Crumb's life and art{{spaced ndash}}which he describes as "the epitome of contemporary white North America's popular art"{{spaced ndash}}as an episode of his ''Personenbeschreibung'' (literally "Person's description") documentary-format broadcast on the German TV network [[ZDF]]. The documentary also includes a "making-of" look at the [then?] forthcoming ''Fritz'' movie, featuring production background interviews with [[Ralph Bakshi]]. By the mid-to-late 2000s, it could still be seen on rotation as part of the ''Personenbeschreibung'' series on the ZDF-owned digital specialty channel ''ZDFdokukanal'' (in 2009 replaced by the new channel [[ZDFneo]]).
* ''The Confessions of Robert Crumb'' (1987)
* ''[[Crumb (film)|Crumb]]'' (1994), a documentary film by [[Terry Zwigoff]]

In the 2003 movie ''[[American Splendor (film)|American Splendor]]'', Crumb was portrayed by [[James Urbaniak]]. Crumb's wife Aline was quoted as saying she hated the interpretation and never would have married Robert if he was like that.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

In 2006, Crumb brought legal action against [[Amazon.com]] after their Web site used a version of his widely recognizable "Keep on Truckin'" character.  The case was expected to be settled out of court.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Underground rap artist [[Aesop Rock]] mentions Crumb several times in his lyrics, including in the songs "Catacomb Kids" from the album ''[[None Shall Pass]]'' and "Nickel Plated Pockets" from his EP "[[Daylight]]".

''R. Crumb's Sex Obsessions'', a collection of his most personally revealing sexually-oriented drawings and comic strips, was released by [[Taschen|TASCHEN publishing]] in November 2007.  In August 2011, following concerns about his safety, Crumb cancelled plans to visit the Graphic 2011 festival in Sydney, Australia after a tabloid labeled him a "self-confessed sex pervert" in an article headlined "Cult genius or filthy weirdo?".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jrBi3_IndAeM5NHwBfytMNcFebBw?docId=CNG.90a0ab9652c589f1e90438beda86c9ea.211 AFP: Graphic artist Crumb cancels Australia visit&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/art-and-design/a-toxic-turn-and-safety-fears-soured-cartoonist-on-visit-20110809-1ikyn.html#ixzz1b78CHsZv |title=A toxic turn and safety fears soured cartoonist on visit |publisher=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=August 10, 2011 |accessdate=October 18, 2011 |author=Fulton, Adam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Crumb appeared in five episodes of ''[http://www.eastriverstringband.com/radioshow/?p=358 John's Old Time Radio Show]'' talking about old music, sex, aliens and [[Bigfoot]]. He also played 78-rpm records from his record room in southern France. He has appeared on the show and recorded at least fourteen one-hour podcasts.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}
