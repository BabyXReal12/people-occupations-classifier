'''Jack Ralph Cole''' (December 14, 1914&amp;nbsp;– August 13, 1958)&lt;ref&gt;Spiegelman and Kidd (2001) give Cole's birth and death dates as "December 1914" and Wednesday, Aug 13, 1958; that death date also appears in Cole's suicide note to Hugh Hefner and in an Aug 14, 1958, ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' news report, both reprinted in the book. The [http://www.lambiek.net/artists/c/cole.htm Jack Cole entry] at the [[Lambiek Comiclopedia]] gives his birth date as December 14, 1914.&lt;/ref&gt; was an American [[cartoonist]] best known for creating the comedic [[superhero]] [[Plastic Man]], and his cartoons for ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine.

==Biography==

===Early life and career===
[[File:PoliceComics24.jpg|thumb|''Police Comics'' No. 24 (Nov. 1943). Cover art by Jack Cole]]
Born in [[New Castle, Pennsylvania|New Castle]], [[Pennsylvania]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawrencecountymemoirs.com/lcmpages/811/artist-cartoonist-jack-cole-new-castle-pa|title=Lawrence County Memoirs: Artist/Cartoonist Jack Cole - New Castle PA|website=www.lawrencecountymemoirs.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cole—the third of six children of a [[dry goods]]-store owner and amateur-entertainer father and a former [[elementary school]]-teacher mother—was untrained in art except for the [[Landon School of Illustration and Cartooning]] [[correspondence course]]. At age 17, he bicycled solo cross-country to Los Angeles, California and back. Cole recounted this adventure in an early self-illustrated professional sale "A Boy and His Bike" (which has often been cited as appearing in ''[[Boys' Life]]'' magazine, but in fact the source of this article is unknown, but speculated to have likely appeared in Cole's hometown newspaper). Back home, Cole took a job at American Can and continued to draw at night.

In 1936, having married childhood sweetheart Dorothy Mahoney soon after graduating [[High school (North America)|high school]], Cole moved with his wife to [[New York City]]'s [[Greenwich Village]]. After spending a year attempting to break in as a [[magazine]]/[[newspaper]] illustrator, Cole began drawing for the studio of the [[Harry "A" Chesler]], one of the first comic-book "packagers" who supplied outsourced stories to publishers entering the new medium. There, Cole drew such features as "TNT Todd of the FBI" and "Little Dynamite" for [[Centaur Publications]] comics such as ''Funny Pages'' and ''Keen Detective Funnies''. He produced such additional features as "King Kole's Kourt" (under the [[pseudonym]] Geo. Nagle), "Officer Clancy", and "Peewee Throttle" (under the pseudonym Ralph Johns), and "Ima Slooth."

===Golden Age of Comic Books===
{{refimprove|section, except for one footnote,|date= April 2014}}
[[Lev Gleason Publications]] hired Cole in 1939 to edit ''Silver Streak Comics'', where one of his first tasks was to revamp the newly created [[superhero]] [[Daredevil (Golden Age)|Daredevil]]. Other characters created or worked on by the prolific tyro include [[Archie Comics|MLJ]]'s The Comet in ''[[Pep Comics]]''—who in short order became the first superhero to be killed—and his replacement, the Hangman.

After becoming an editor at Lev Gleason and revamping [[Jack Binder (comics)|Jack Binder]]'s original [[Golden Age of comic books|Golden Age]] [[Daredevil (Golden Age)|Daredevil]] in 1940, Cole was hired at [[Quality Comics]]. He worked with [[Will Eisner]], assisting on the writer-artist's signature hero [[The Spirit]]—a masked crime-fighter created for a weekly syndicated newspaper Sunday supplement and reprinted in Quality Comics. At the behest of Quality publisher [[Everett "Busy" Arnold]], Cole later created his own satiric, Spirit-style hero, [[Midnight (DC Comics)|Midnight]], for ''Smash Comics'' No. 18 (Jan. 1941). Midnight, the alter ego of [[radio]] announcer Dave Clark, wore a similar [[Fedora (hat)|fedora]] hat and domino mask, and partnered with a talking [[monkey]]—questionably in place of the Spirit's young [[African-American]] sidekick, [[Ebony White]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toonopedia.com/midnight.htm|title=Don Markstein's Toonopedia: Midnight|first=Donald D.|last=Markstein|website=www.toonopedia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; During Eisner's [[World War II]] [[military service]], Cole and [[Lou Fine]] were the primary ''Spirit'' ghost artists; their stories were reprinted in [[DC Comics]]' hardcover collections ''The Spirit Archives'' Vols. 5 to 9 (2001–2003), spanning July 1942&amp;nbsp;– Dec. 1944. In addition, Cole continued to draw one and two-page filler pieces, sometimes under the pseudonym Ralph Johns, and a memorable autobiographical appearance in "Inki," which appeared in ''[[Crack Comics]]'' #34.&lt;ref&gt;''Crack Comics'' No. 34 (Quality Comics, Autumn 1944).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plastic Man===
{{main article|Plastic Man}}
[[File:JackColeMagArt01.jpg|thumb|left|190px|Sample of Cole's original art for ''[[Humorama]]'']]
Cole created Plastic Man for a backup feature in Quality's ''[[Police Comics]]'' #1 (Aug. 1941). While [[Timely Comics]]' quickly forgotten Flexo the Rubber Man had preceded "Plas" as comics' first stretching hero, Cole's character became an immediate hit, and ''Police Comics''{{'}} lead feature with issue #5. As well, Cole's offbeat humor, combined with Plastic Man's ability to take any shape, gave the cartoonist opportunities to experiment with text and graphics in groundbreaking manner—helping to define the medium's visual vocabulary{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}, and making the idiosyncratic character one of the few to endure from the Golden Age to modern times. Plastic Man gained his own title in 1943.

By the decade's end, however, Cole's feature was being created entirely by anonymous ghost writers and artists—including [[Alex Kotzky]]{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} and [[John Spranger]]{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}—despite Cole's name being bannered. One last stint by Cole himself in 1949 and 1950 could not save the title. ''Plastic Man'' was cancelled in 1956 after several years of reprinting the Cole material, and new stories by others.

Additionally, Cole and writer Joe Millard created the lighthearted feature "The Barker", starring [[carnival barker]] Carnie Callhan. Introduced in ''National Comics'' #42 (May, 1944), the feature spun off into a 15-issue comic of its own (Autumn 1946 - Dec. 1949)&lt;ref&gt;[http://toonopedia.com/barker.htm "The Barker"] at [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]].  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6b6cHdl9u?url=http://toonopedia.com/barker.htm |date=August 27, 2015 }} from the original on August 27, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Playboy''===
{{refimprove|section, except for one quote with two footnotes for it, |date= April 2014}}
Cole's career by that time had taken on another dimension. In 1954, after having drawn slightly risqué, single-panel "[[good girl art]]" cartoons for magazines, using the pen name "Jake", Cole became a cartoon illustrator for ''Playboy''. Under his own name, he produced full-page, watercolored gag cartoons of beautiful but dim girls and rich but equally dim old men. Cole's art first appeared in the fifth issue; he would have at least one piece published in ''Playboy'' each month for the rest of his life.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} So popular was his work that the second item of merchandise ever licensed by Playboy (after cufflinks with the famous rabbit-head logo) was a cocktail-napkin set, "Females by Cole", featuring his cartoons.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Cole biographer [[Art Spiegelman]] said, "Cole's goddesses were estrogen soufflés who mesmerized the ineffectual saps who lusted after them."&lt;ref&gt;Chun (2004), p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spiegelman and Kidd (2001), p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Betsy and Me''===
{{main article|Betsy and Me}}
In 1958, Cole created his own daily newspaper [[comic strip]], ''Betsy and Me'', which he sold to the [[Chicago Sun-Times Syndicate]].&lt;ref name=toonopedia&gt;[http://toonopedia.com/betsynme.htm ''Betsy and Me''] at [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]].  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6b6ZBrhVh?url=http://toonopedia.com/betsynme.htm |date=August 27, 2015 }} from the original on August 27, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The strip began on May 26 and chronicled the domestic adventures of nebbishy Chester Tibbet as narrator, his wife Betsy, and their 5-year-old genius son, Farley.&lt;ref name=toonopedia /&gt; For it, Cole utilized "a simplified style," historian [[Ron Goulart]] wrote, "reminiscent of the drawing in the [[United Productions of America|UPA]] animated cartoons."&lt;ref name=hogans-goulart&gt;{{cite news | url = http://cartoonician.com/jack-and-betsy-and-me/ | title = Jack and Betsy and Me | authorlink= Ron Goulart | first = Ron | last= Goulart | work = Hogan's Alley | publisher= Bull Moose Publishing | date=May 18, 2012 | accessdate= 2013-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Betsy and Me'' ran for two-and-a-half months before Cole's self-inflicted death; his last daily was published on September 6 and his last Sunday on September 14. In the final Cole daily, Betsy and Chester are seen signing up for a brand-new tract house in Sunken Hills.&lt;ref name=hogans-goulart /&gt; The syndicate hire advertising artist Dwight Parks, who had been trying to sell his own strip about a philosophical hobo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Apeldoorn|first=Ger|journal=Hogan's Alley| title= [Title needed] |date=January 2010|issue=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--The last Sunday by Parks was dated December 21, 1958.&lt;ref&gt;''Betsy and Me", December 21, 1958, reprinted at {{cite web|last=Apeldoorn|first=Ger|title=The Fabuleous Fifties|url=http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lBp6zXnn7nQ/UrtM46JJznI/AAAAAAABJOE/IJgi10xSK2c/s1600/Betsy-and-Me-1958-12-21.jpg}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

===Cole's death===
Cole killed himself on August 13, 1958. [[R. C. Harvey]] described it as "one of the most baffling events in the history of cartooning".&lt;ref&gt;R. C. Harvey (2007), p. xx–xxi&lt;/ref&gt; Cole was living at 703 Silver Lake Road in [[Cary, Illinois|Cary]], [[Illinois]], about 40 miles northwest of [[Chicago]], and told his wife at about two in the afternoon that he was picking up the mail and the newspapers. Driving his Chevrolet station wagon to Dave Donner's Sport Shop in nearby [[Crystal Lake, Illinois|Crystal Lake]], he purchased a [[.22LR|.22]] caliber, [[single-shot]] [[Marlin Firearms|Marlin]] [[rifle]]. He phoned a neighbor between 5:15 and 5:30&amp;nbsp;pm to say what he was doing, and for the neighbor to tell Dorothy. Parked on a gravel road west of the intersection of Illinois Routes 176 and 14, Cole was found by three boys at approximately 6&amp;nbsp;pm, shot in the head but still alive. A McHenry County sheriff's deputy arrived and called for an ambulance ten minutes later. Cole died at nearby Woodstock Hospital at 6:45&amp;nbsp;pm

That morning, he had mailed two suicide notes, one to Dorothy (who at a [[coroner]]'s [[inquest]] testified that he had given his reasons) and one to his friend and boss, ''Playboy'' editor-publisher [[Hugh Hefner]]. The letter to his wife was never made public and the reasons for Cole's suicide have remained unknown. Dorothy never again spoke with her late husband's family nor with Hefner, and remarried approximately a year later.

==Legacy==
Cole was posthumously inducted into the comic book industry's [[List of Harvey Award winners#The Jack Kirby Hall of Fame|Jack Kirby Hall of Fame]] in 1991&lt;ref name="ha"/&gt; and the [[List of Eisner Award winners#The Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame|Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame]] in 1999.&lt;ref name="ea"/&gt;

Cole's story "Murder, Morphine and Me", which he illustrated and possibly wrote&lt;ref&gt;Spiegelman and Kidd (2001), p. 91, do not specify who wrote the uncredited story; the [http://comics.org/details.lasso?id=255419#2 Grand Comics Database entry for the issue] cites it as possibly written by Cole.&lt;/ref&gt; for publisher [[Magazine Village]]'s ''[[True Crime Comics]]'' No. 2 (May 1947), became a centerpiece of psychiatrist Dr. [[Fredric Wertham]]'s crusade against violent comic books. Wertham, author of the influential study ''[[Seduction of the Innocent]]'', cited a particular panel of the story's dope-dealing narrator about to be stabbed in the eye with a [[hypodermic needle]] as an example of the "injury-to-the-eye" motif.&lt;ref&gt;Chun (2004), p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, writer-artist [[Art Spiegelman]] and artist [[Chip Kidd]] collaborated on a Cole biography,&lt;ref&gt;Spiegelman and Kidd (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; a portion of which had been published in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' magazine in 1999.
