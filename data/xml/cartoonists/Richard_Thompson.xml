[[File:Colorculdesac.jpg|right|thumb|460px|Richard Thompson's ''Cul de Sac'' (October 7, 2007)]]
'''Richard Church Thompson''' (October 8, 1957 – July 27, 2016) was an American illustrator and [[cartoonist]] best known for his syndicated comic strip ''[[Cul de Sac (comic strip)|Cul de Sac]]'' and the illustrated poem "[[Richard's Poor Almanac|Make the Pie Higher]]". He was given the Reuben Award for Outstanding Cartoonist of the Year for 2010.

==''Cul de Sac''==
In 1982 Thompson began working at the ''Washington Post'', and he was the newspaper's unofficial staff artist by 1985. Thompson provided illustrations for [[Joel Achenbach]]'s ''Washington Post'' column and [[Gene Weingarten]]'s column in ''The Washington Post Magazine''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tcj.com/richard-thompson-1957-2016/|title=Richard Thompson, 1957–2016|last=|first=|date=August 4, 2016|website=www.tcj.com|publisher=The Comics Journal|access-date=2016-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The weekly, watercolored incarnation of his comic ''Cul de Sac'' launched in ''The Washington Post Magazine'' on February 14, 2004. The strip focuses on a four-year-old girl, Alice Otterloop, and her daily life at [[preschool]] and at home. It was published in more than 70 newspapers by the fall of 2007. It was distributed nationally as both a daily and Sunday strip by [[Universal Press Syndicate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.comicsreporter.com/index.php/resources/interviews/12135/|title=A Short Interview With Richard Thompson|last=|first=|date=January 26, 2008|website=www.comicsreporter.com|publisher=|access-date=2016-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first book collection of ''Cul de Sac'' strips, published in 2008 by Andrews McMeel, includes the pre-syndication ''Washington Post'' strips in color, as well as a foreword by [[Bill Watterson]], who praised Thompson's work:

{{quote|I thought the best newspaper comic strips were long gone, and I've never been happier to be wrong. Richard Thompson's ''Cul de Sac'' has it all—intelligence, gentle humor, a delightful way with words, and, most surprising of all, wonderful, wonderful drawings.

''Cul de Sac'''s whimsical take on the world and playful sense of language somehow gets funnier the more times you read it. Four-year-old Alice and her Blisshaven Preschool classmates will ring true to any parent. Doing projects in a cloud of glue and glitter, the little kids manage to reinterpret an otherwise incomprehensible world via their meandering, nonstop chatter. But I think my favorite character is Alice's older brother, Petey. A haunted, controlling milquetoast, he's surely one of the most neurotic kids to appear in comics. These children and their struggles are presented affectionately, and one of the things I like best about ''Cul de Sac'' is its natural warmth. ''Cul de Sac'' avoids both mawkishness and cynicism and instead finds genuine charm in its loopy appreciation of small events. Very few strips can hit this subtle note.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Watterson |first=Bill |authorlink1=Bill Watterson |editor-last=Thompson |editor-first=Richard |title=Cul de Sac |location=Kansas City |publisher=Andrews McMeel |date=2008 |page=6 |chapter=Foreword |isbn=978-0-7407-7651-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Childrenatplay.jpg|right|thumb|250px]]
In 2009, Andrews McMeel published a second ''Cul de Sac'' collection, ''Children at Play'', featuring a foreword by [[Mo Willems]].

==''Richard's Poor Almanac''==
Thompson's cartoon series ''[[Richard's Poor Almanac]]'' appeared weekly (usually on Saturdays) in the ''Washington Post'' Style section. A compendium of his ''Richard's Poor Almanac'' cartoons was published by Emmis Books in 2005.

The ''Richard's Poor Almanac'' cartoon published the week of [[George W. Bush]]'s first inauguration included a mock inaugural poem, "Make the Pie Higher," composed of some of Bush's more incoherent quotations, or "[[Bushisms]]". When "Make the Pie Higher" was leaked onto the Internet, it spread rapidly and was eventually dissected and analyzed on [[Snopes.com]], which did a lengthy review of its origins. The poem has been set to music at least five times in various styles, including Irish and choral music.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/politics/bush/piehigher.asp|title=Make the Pie Higher!|last=Mikkelson|first=David|date=21 July 2008|website=www.snopes.com|publisher=Snopes.com|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Illustrations==
Thompson's illustrations have appeared in ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'', ''[[The New Yorker]]'', ''[[Air &amp; Space|Air &amp; Space/Smithsonian]]'', ''[[National Geographic Society#National Geographic Magazine|National Geographic]]'' and ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]''.

In 2004, Thompson illustrated [[Francis Heaney]]'s ''[[Holy Tango of Literature]]''. In 2010, he wrote and illustrated "Barney Google and the Bigfoot Style", the foreword for Craig Yoe's ''[[IDW Publishing|Barney Google: Gambling, Horse Races &amp; High-Toned Women]]'' (Yoe Books/IDW, 2010).

In 2010, the Pixar director [[Pete Docter]] hired Thompson to work on character sketches and development for his upcoming movie ''[[Inside Out (2015 film)|Inside Out]]''.&lt;ref name="pixar"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/comic-riffs/wp/2015/01/09/the-art-of-richard-thompson-why-pixar-filmmaker-pete-docter-up-tapped-the-cul-de-sac-creators-gifts/|title=The Art of Richard Thompson: Why Pixar filmmaker Pete Docter ('Up') tapped the 'Cul de Sac' creator's gifts|publisher=The Washington Post|date=January 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the [[Billy Ireland Cartoon Library &amp; Museum]] at Ohio State University hosted an exhibition of Thompson's work: "The Irresistible Force Meets the Immovable Object: A Richard Thompson Retrospective".&lt;ref name="OSU"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://library.osu.edu/blogs/cartoons/2014/03/20/new-interview-calvin-hobbes-creator-bill-watterson-and-cul-de-sac-creator-richard-thompson-talk-libraries-comics-and-the-creative-process-with-ohio-state/|title=Calvin &amp; Hobbes creator Bill Watterson and Cul de Sac creator Richard Thompson talk libraries, comics, and the creative process with Ohio State;|work=Ohio State University Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

Thompson was a long-time resident of [[Arlington, Virginia]].

On July 16, 2009, Thompson announced that he had been diagnosed with [[Parkinson's disease]], a problem he described as "a pain in the fundament", which slowed him down but did not affect his drawing hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://richardspooralmanac.blogspot.com/2009/07/some-news.html|title=Cul de Sac: Some News|last=Thompson|first=Richard|date=July 16, 2009|website=Cul de Sac|publisher=|access-date=2016-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stephan Pastis]], creator of ''[[Pearls Before Swine (comic strip)|Pearls Before Swine]]'', described Thompson as "probably the most talented all-around syndicated cartoonist working today" and praised the courage and optimism he showed in revealing his illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://stephanpastis.wordpress.com/2009/07/18/some-news-about-courage/|title=Some News About Courage|last=Pastis|first=Stephan|date=July 18, 2009|website=Pearls Before Swine|publisher=|access-date=2016-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The children's book illustrator [[Stacy Curtis]] became the inker of ''Cul de Sac'' on March 26, 2012;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.comicsreporter.com/index.php/stacy_curtis_joins_richard_thompson_on_cul_de_sac/|title=Stacy Curtis Joins Richard Thompson On Cul De Sac|last=|first=|date=March 26, 2012|website=www.comicsreporter.com|publisher=|access-date=2016-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; but by August the effects of Parkinson's were progressing, and Thompson announced that he would be ending ''Cul de Sac'': "Parkinson's disease is horribly selfish and demanding. A daily comic strip is too and I can only deal with one at a time. So it was a long, gradual, sudden decision."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/comic-riffs/post/richard-thompson-ends-cul-de-sac-comic/2012/08/17/06a7fda6-e819-11e1-a3d2-2a05679928ef_blog.html |title=Breaking: Cul de Sac|date=August 17, 2012|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|access-date=2016-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the book ''Team Cul de Sac: Cartoonists Draw the Line at Parkinson's'' was published. It was created by his close friend Chris Sparks to honor Richard. It features the work of [[Bill Watterson]] and other cartoonists, who rallied together to raise money to benefit [[The Michael J. Fox Foundation|Team Fox]], the fundraising arm of the Michael J. Fox Foundation that is working to find a cure for Parkinson's disease.

In 2014, Watterson, [[Nick Galifianakis (cartoonist)|Nick Galifianakis]] and David Apatoff published a collection of Thompson's artwork and illustrations: ''The Art of Richard Thompson''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Art-Richard-Thompson-Bill-Watterson/dp/1449447953/ |title=Book: The Art of Richard Thompson}}&lt;/ref&gt; A short documentary of the same name,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.g-v-i.com/portfolio/the-art-of-richard-thompson/|title=Film: The Art of Richard Thompson}}&lt;/ref&gt; profiling Thompson and his work, was also produced that year, directed by Bob Burnett.

In June 2016 Encore Stage &amp; Studios in Arlington, Virginia, premiered the play ''Cul de Sac'' by Amy Thompson — Richard's wife — based on his comic strip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encorestageva.org/2015/05/19/cul-de-sac/|title=Encore Stage &amp; Studio presents 'Cul de Sac'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thompson died on July 27, 2016, from complications of Parkinson's disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/comic-riffs/wp/2016/07/27/richard-thompson-acclaimed-cul-de-sac-creator-and-post-contributor-dies-at-58/ |title=Richard Thompson, acclaimed 'Cul de Sac' creator and Post contributor, dies at 58 |publisher=[[The Washington Post]] |access-date=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
