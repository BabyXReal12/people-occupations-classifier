'''James Grover Thurber''' (December 8, 1894 – November 2, 1961) was an American [[cartoonist]], author, [[humorist]], journalist, playwright, and celebrated [[wit]]. He was best known for his [[gag cartoon|cartoons]] and short stories published mainly in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' magazine, such as "The Catbird Seat", and collected in his numerous books. He was one of the most popular humorists of his time, as he celebrated the comic frustrations and eccentricities of ordinary people. He wrote the Broadway comedy ''[[The Male Animal]]'' in collaboration with his college friend [[Elliott Nugent]]; it was later adapted into a film starring [[Henry Fonda]] and [[Olivia de Havilland]]. His short story "[[The Secret Life of Walter Mitty]]" has been adapted for film twice, once [[The Secret Life of Walter Mitty (1947 film)|in 1947]] and again [[The Secret Life of Walter Mitty (2013 film)|in 2013]].

==Life==
Thurber was born in [[Columbus, Ohio]], to Charles L. Thurber and Mary Agnes "Mame" (née Fisher) Thurber on December 8, 1894. Both of his parents greatly influenced his work. His father was a sporadically employed clerk and minor politician who dreamed of being a lawyer or an actor. Thurber described his mother as a "born comedian" and "one of the finest comic talents I think I have ever known." She was a practical joker and, on one occasion, pretended to be crippled and attended a faith healer revival, only to jump up and proclaim herself healed.&lt;ref name="Authors"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/thurber.htm |title=James Thurber |website=Books and Writers ''(kirjasto.sci.fi)'' |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060819141311/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/thurber.htm |archivedate=August 19, 2006 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Thurber was seven years old, he and one of his brothers were playing a [[Shooting an apple off one's child's head#William Tell|game of William Tell]], when his brother shot James in the eye with an arrow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/why-is-there-a-street-in-falls-church-va-named-after-james-thurber/2018/04/07/98d14084-3903-11e8-9c0a-85d477d9a226_story.html|title=Perspective {{!}} Why is there a street in Falls Church, Va., named after James Thurber?|last=Kelly|first=John|date=2018-04-07|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-05-17|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; He lost that eye, and the injury later caused him to become almost entirely blind. He was unable to participate in sports and other activities in his childhood because of this injury, but he developed a creative mind which he used to express himself in writings.&lt;ref name="Authors"/&gt; Neurologist [[Vilayanur S. Ramachandran|V .S. Ramachandran]] suggests that Thurber's imagination may be partly explained by [[Charles Bonnet syndrome]], a neurological condition which causes complex visual hallucinations in people who have suffered some level of visual loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=85–7|title=Phantoms in the Brain|author=[[V.S. Ramachandran]]| publisher = HarperCollins | year = 1988 |author2=[[Sandra Blakeslee]]|title-link=Phantoms in the Brain}}&lt;/ref&gt; (This was the basis for the piece "The Admiral on the Wheel".)

From 1913 to 1918, Thurber attended [[Ohio State University]] where he was a member of the [[Phi Kappa Psi]] fraternity. He never graduated from the university because his poor eyesight prevented him from taking a mandatory [[Reserve Officers' Training Corps]] (ROTC) course.&lt;ref name="House"&gt;{{cite web|author=Thurber House|title=James Thurber|url=http://www.thurberhouse.org/james/james.html|accessdate=2007-10-14|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012130424/http://thurberhouse.org/james/james.html |archivedate=2007-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995 he was posthumously awarded a degree.&lt;ref name="House2"&gt;{{cite web|author=Thurber House |title=James Thurber: His Life &amp; Times |url=http://www.thurberhouse.org/james/life_2.html |accessdate=2007-10-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060114100742/http://www.thurberhouse.org/james/life_2.html |archivedate=January 14, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:James Thurber House.jpg|thumb|right|Thurber's house in [[Columbus, Ohio]]]]
From 1918 to 1920, Thurber worked as a code clerk for the [[United States Department of State]], first in Washington, D.C. and then at the [[Embassy of the United States, Paris|embassy in Paris]]. On returning to Columbus, he began his career as a reporter for ''[[The Columbus Dispatch]]'' from 1921 to 1924. During part of this time, he reviewed books, films, and plays in a weekly column called "Credos and Curios", a title that was given to a posthumous collection of his work. Thurber returned to Paris during this period, where he wrote for the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' and other newspapers.&lt;ref name="House2"/&gt;

===Move to New York===
In 1925, Thurber moved to [[Greenwich Village]] in New York City, getting a job as a reporter for the ''[[New York Post|New York Evening Post]]''. He joined the staff of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' in 1927 as an editor, with the help of [[E.B. White]], his friend and fellow ''New Yorker'' contributor. His career as a cartoonist began in 1930 after White found some of Thurber's drawings in a trash can and submitted them for publication; White inked-in some of these earlier drawings to make them reproduce better for the magazine, and years later expressed deep regret that he had done such a thing. Thurber contributed both his writings and his drawings to ''The New Yorker'' until the 1950s.

===Marriage and family===
Thurber married Althea Adams in 1922, but the marriage was troubled and ended in divorce in May 1935.&lt;ref name="Authors"/&gt; They lived in [[Fairfield County, Connecticut]], with their daughter Rosemary (b. 1931).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1975/03/12/archives/a-window-into-thurbers-secret-life.html ''A Window Into Thurber's Secret Life''], The New York Times, 12 March 1975&lt;/ref&gt; He married Helen Wismer (1902–1986) in June 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Helen Thurber Is Dead at 84; Edited Writings of Husband|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/26/obituaries/helen-thurber-is-dead-at-84-edited-writings-of-husband.html|website=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
Thurber's behavior became erratic and unpredictable in his last year. At a party hosted by [[Noël Coward]], Thurber was taken back to the [[Algonquin Hotel]] at six in the morning. Thurber was stricken with a blood clot on the brain on October 4, 1961, and underwent emergency surgery, drifting in and out of consciousness. The operation was initially successful, but Thurber died a few weeks later, on November 2, aged 66, due to complications from pneumonia. The doctors said his brain was [[Senescence|senescent]] from several small strokes and hardening of the arteries. His last words, aside from the repeated word "God", were "God bless... God damn", according to his wife, Helen.&lt;ref name="Bernstein 501"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bernstein|first=Burton|authorlink=Burton Bernstein|title=Thurber|publisher=[[Dodd, Mead &amp; Company]]|year=1975|location=New York|page=501|isbn=978-0-396-07027-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aKrZAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy and honors==
* Established in 1997, the annual [[Thurber Prize for American Humor|Thurber Prize]] honors outstanding examples of American humor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/life_and_entertainment/2009/10/06/thurber_prize.html | title=Frazier first to win Thurber Prize twice | publisher=''The Columbus Dispatch'' | date=October 5, 2009 | author=Grossberg, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2008, [[The Library of America]] selected Thurber's story, "A Sort of Genius", first published in ''The New Yorker'', for inclusion in its two-century retrospective of American True Crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.loa.org/books/289-true-crime-an-american-anthology | title=True Crime: An American Anthology | publisher=Library of America}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Two of his residences have been listed on the U.S. [[National Register of Historic Places]]: his childhood [[Thurber House]] in Ohio and the [[Sanford-Curtis-Thurber House]] in [[Fairfield County, Connecticut]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nationalregisterofhistoricplaces.com/ct/fairfield/state5.html | title=CONNECTICUT - Fairfield County | publisher=National Register of Historic Places}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nationalregisterofhistoricplaces.com/oh/franklin/state6.html | title=OHIO - Franklin County | publisher=National Register of Historic Places}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Uniquely among major American literary figures, he became equally well known for his simple, surrealistic drawings and cartoons. Both his skills were helped along by the support of, and collaboration with, fellow ''New Yorker'' staff member [[E. B. White]], who insisted that Thurber's sketches could stand on their own as artistic expressions. Thurber drew six covers and numerous classic illustrations for ''The New Yorker''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://writersalmanac.org/note/dec-8-2015-birthday-james-thurber/ | title=Dec. 8, 2015: birthday: James Thurber | publisher=The Writer’s Almanac}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writer===
The last twenty years of Thurber's life were filled with material and professional success in spite of his handicap. He published at least fourteen more books, including ''The Thurber Carnival'' (1945), ''Thurber Country'' (1953), and the extremely popular account of the life of the ''New Yorker'' editor [[Harold Ross]], ''The Years with Ross'' (1959). A number of his short stories were made into movies, including "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" (1947). Many of his short stories are humorous fictional memoirs from his life, but he also wrote darker material, such as "The Whip-Poor-Will", a story of madness and murder. His best-known short stories are "The Dog That Bit People" and [http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1933/07/08/my-life-and-hard-times-i-the-night-the-bed-fell "The Night the Bed Fell"]; they can be found in ''My Life and Hard Times'', which was his "break-out" book. Among his other classics are ''[[The Secret Life of Walter Mitty]]'', ''[[The Catbird Seat]]'', ''[[A Couple of Hamburgers]]'', ''The Greatest Man in the World'', ''If [[Ulysses S. Grant|Grant]] Had Been Drinking at [[Appomattox Court House National Historical Park|Appomattox]]''. ''The Middle-Aged Man on the Flying Trapeze'' has several short stories with a tense undercurrent of marital discord. The book was published the year of his divorce and remarriage.
{{anchor|look it up}}His 1941 story "You Could Look It Up",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/satevepost/james_thurber.pdf "You Could Look It Up"], ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'', April 5, 1941, pp. 9–11, 114, 116&lt;/ref&gt; about a three-foot adult being brought in to take a walk in a baseball game, is said to have inspired [[Bill Veeck]]'s stunt with [[Eddie Gaedel]] with the [[Saint Louis Browns|St. Louis Browns]] in 1951. Veeck claimed an older provenance for the stunt, but was certainly aware of the Thurber story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Veeck|first=Bill|authorlink=Bill Veeck|author2=Ed Linn|title="A Can of Beer, a Slice of Cake—and Thou, Eddie Gaedel", from ''Veeck – As In Wreck: The Autobiography of Bill Veeck''|publisher=[[The University of Chicago Press]]|year=1962|location=Chicago, IL|pages=11–23|url=http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/852180.html|isbn=978-0-226-85218-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to his other fiction, Thurber wrote over seventy-five [[fable]]s, some of which were first published in "The New Yorker" (1939), then collected in ''[[Fables for Our Time and Famous Poems Illustrated|Fables for Our Time &amp; Famous Poems Illustrated]]'' (1940) and ''Further Fables for Our Time'' (1956). These were short stories that featured anthropomorphic animals (e.g. ''The Little Girl and the Wolf'', his version of ''[[Little Red Riding Hood]]'') as main characters, and ended with a moral as a tagline. An exception to this format was his most famous fable, ''[[The Unicorn in the Garden]]'', which featured an all-human cast except for the unicorn, which doesn't speak. Thurber's fables were [[satire|satirical]], and the morals served as [[Punch line|punchline]]s as well as advice to the reader, demonstrating "the complexity of life by depicting the world as an uncertain, precarious place, where few reliable guidelines exist."&lt;ref&gt;[http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/chq/summary/v009/9.2.maharg.html "The Modern Fable: James Thurber's Social Criticisms"], by Ruth A. Maharg, ''[[Children's Literature Association Quarterly]]'', Volume 9, Number 2, Summer 1984, pp. 72-73.&lt;/ref&gt;

His stories also included several book-length fairy tales, such as ''[[The White Deer]]'' (1945), ''[[The 13 Clocks]]'' (1950) and ''[[The Wonderful O]]'' (1957). The latter was one of several of Thurber's works illustrated by [[Marc Simont]]. Thurber's prose for ''The New Yorker'' and other venues included numerous humorous essays. A favorite subject, especially toward the end of his life, was the English language. Pieces on this subject included "The Spreading 'You Know'," which decried the overuse of that pair of words in conversation, "The New Vocabularianism", "What Do You Mean It ''Was'' Brillig?", and many others. His short pieces – whether stories, essays or something in between – were referred to as "casuals" by Thurber and the staff of ''The New Yorker''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sorel|first=Edward|title=The Business of Being Funny|work=The New York Times|publisher=Time Inc.|date=1989-11-05|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE5D9113CF936A35752C1A96F948260|accessdate=2007-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thurber wrote a biographical memoir about the founder/publisher of ''The New Yorker'', [[Harold Ross]], entitled ''The Years with Ross'' (1958). He wrote a five-part ''New Yorker'' series, between 1947 and 1948, examining in depth the radio soap opera phenomenon, based on near-constant listening and researching over the same period. Leaving nearly no element of these programs unexamined, including their writers, producers, sponsors, performers, and listeners alike, Thurber republished the series in his anthology, ''The Beast in Me and Other Animals'' (1948), under the section title "Soapland." The series was one of the first to examine such a pop-culture phenomenon in depth.

===Cartoonist===
While Thurber drew his cartoons in the usual fashion in the 1920s and 1930s, his failing eyesight later required changes. He drew them on very large sheets of paper using a thick black crayon (or on black paper using white chalk, from which they were photographed and the colors reversed for publication). Regardless of method, his cartoons became as noted as his writings; they possessed an eerie, wobbly feel that seems to mirror his idiosyncratic view on life. He once wrote that people said it looked like he drew them under water. [[Dorothy Parker]], a contemporary and friend of Thurber, referred to his cartoons as having the "semblance of unbaked cookies". The last drawing Thurber completed was a self-portrait in yellow crayon on black paper, which was featured as the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine on July 9, 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Time Magazine Cover: James Thurber – July 9, 1951|work=Time Archive: 1923 to the Present|publisher=Time Inc.|date=1951-07-09|url=http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19510709,00.html|accessdate=2007-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same drawing was used for the dust jacket of ''The Thurber Album'' ([[1952 in literature|1952]]).

===Adaptations===
*Thurber teamed with college schoolmate (and actor/director) [[Elliott Nugent]] to write ''[[The Male Animal]],'' a comic drama that became a major Broadway hit in 1939. The play was adapted as a film by the same name in 1942, starring [[Henry Fonda]], [[Olivia de Havilland]] and [[Jack Carson]].
*In 1947 his short story "[[The Secret Life of Walter Mitty]]", was loosely adapted as a [[The Secret Life of Walter Mitty (1947 film)|film by the same name]]. [[Danny Kaye]] played the title character.
*In 1951 [[United Productions of America]] announced an animated feature to be based on Thurber's work, titled ''Men, Women and Dogs''.&lt;ref name="Priceless"&gt;{{cite news|title=Priceless Gift of Laughter|work=Time Archive: 1923 to the Present|publisher=Time Inc.|date=1951-07-09|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,806164-1,00.html|accessdate=2007-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only part of the ambitious project that was eventually released was the UPA cartoon ''[[The Unicorn in the Garden]]'' (1953).&lt;ref name="Unicorn"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Unicorn in the Garden|work=The Big Cartoon Database|url=http://www.bcdb.com/cartoon/725-Unicorn_In_The_Garden.html|accessdate=2007-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1960, Thurber fulfilled a long-standing desire to be on the professional stage and played himself in 88 performances of the revue ''[[A Thurber Carnival]]'' (which echoes the title of his 1945 book, ''The Thurber Carnival''). It was based on a selection of Thurber's stories and cartoon captions. Thurber appeared in the sketch "File and Forget". The sketch consists of Thurber dictating a series of letters in a vain attempt to keep one of his publishers from sending him books he did not order, and the escalating confusion of the replies.&lt;ref name="Bernstein 477"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bernstein|first=Burton|authorlink=Burton Bernstein|title=Thurber|publisher=[[Dodd, Mead &amp; Company]]|year=1975|location=New York|page=477|isbn=978-0-396-07027-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aKrZAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thurber won a special [[Tony Award]] for the adapted script of the ''Carnival''.&lt;ref name="IBDB"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Thurber Carnival|work=Internet Broadway Database|publisher=The Broadway League|url=http://www.ibdb.com/production.asp?ID=2101|accessdate=2008-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1961, "The Secret Life of James Thurber" aired on ''[[The DuPont Show with June Allyson]]''. [[Adolphe Menjou]] appeared in the program as Fitch, and [[Orson Bean]] and [[Sue Randall]] portrayed John and Ellen Monroe.
*In 1969-70, a full series based on Thurber's writings and life, entitled ''[[My World and Welcome to It]],'' was broadcast on [[NBC]]. It starred [[William Windom (actor)|William Windom]] as the Thurber figure. Featuring animated portions in addition to live actors, the show won a 1970 [[Emmy Award]] as the year's best comedy series. Windom won an Emmy as well. He went on to perform Thurber material in a one-man stage show.
*In 1972 another film adaptation, ''[[The War Between Men and Women]]'', starring [[Jack Lemmon]], concludes with an animated version of Thurber's classic anti-war work "The Last Flower".
*In 2013, a new [[The Secret Life of Walter Mitty (2013 film)|adaptation]] of ''[[The Secret Life of Walter Mitty]]'', starring [[Ben Stiller]] as the title character.

==Popular culture==
*Beginning during his own father's terminal illness, television broadcaster [[Keith Olbermann]] read excerpts from Thurber's short stories during the closing segment of his [[MSNBC]] program ''[[Countdown with Keith Olbermann]]'' on Fridays, which he called "Fridays with Thurber."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/41201964 |title=Olbermann signs off msnbc - Entertainment - Television - TODAY.com |publisher=Today.msnbc.msn.com |accessdate=2012-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*On an episode of [[Norm Macdonald]]'s video podcast, ''Norm Macdonald Live'', Norm tells a story in which comedian [[Larry Miller (comedian)|Larry Miller]] acknowledges that his biggest influence in comedy was Thurber.
