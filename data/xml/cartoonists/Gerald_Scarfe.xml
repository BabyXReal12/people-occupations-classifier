'''Gerald Anthony Scarfe''', [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]], [[Royal Designers for Industry|RDI]] (born 1 June 1936) is an English [[cartoonist]] and [[illustrator]]. He has worked as [[editorial cartoonist]] for ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]'' and illustrator for ''[[The New Yorker]]''.

His other work includes graphics for rock group [[Pink Floyd]], particularly on their 1979 album ''[[The Wall]]'', its [[Pink Floyd—The Wall|1982 film adaption]], and tour ([[The Wall Tour|1980-81]]), as well as the music video for "[[Welcome to the Machine]]".&lt;ref&gt;John Walker. (1987) [http://www.artdesigncafe.com/Gerald-Scarfe-Pink-Floyd-The-Wall-Walker-1987 "Gerald Scarfe &amp; Pink Floyd"]. In ''Cross-Overs: Art into Pop, Pop into Art''/''artdesigncafe''. Retrieved 31 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=floydianslip&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.floydianslip.com/pink-floyd/interviews/gerald-scarfe.php|title=Interview with Floydian Slip radio program|accessdate=8 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Scarfe was the production designer on the [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] animated feature ''[[Hercules (1997 film)|Hercules]]'' (1997). Scarfe also provided the opening titles for ''[[Yes Minister]]'' and ''[[Yes, Prime Minister]]''.

==Early life==
Scarfe was born in [[St John's Wood]], London.&lt;ref&gt;GRO Register of Births: SEP 1936 1a 774 HAMPSTEAD, Gerald A. Scarfe, mmn = Gardner&lt;/ref&gt; As Scarfe was severely asthmatic as a child, he spent many of his early years bed-ridden, so drawing became a means of entertainment as well as a creative outlet. It has been speculated{{bywhom|date=December 2017}} that the grotesque and diseased images that often characterise his work are a result of these experiences. He has himself stated that the irreverence apparent in much of his work can be traced back to "dodgy treatments" and a reliance on what he feels were incompetent doctors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Kevin|last=Perry|title=Gerald Scarfe feature interview and profile|url=http://kevinegperry.com/2007/02/27/gerald-scarfe-interview|publisher=[[The Beaver]]|date=27 February 2007|accessdate=29 September 2010|location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 14 and now living in Hampstead, he decided it would be easy to cycle to Bayswater and visit the cartoonist [[Ronald Searle]].  He went several times but never rang the doorbell. It would be many years later that he would actually meet Ronald Searle. He went to [[Saint Martin's School of Art]] (now part of the [[University of the Arts London]]) in [[Holborn]], London.&lt;ref name=horn&gt;Maurice Horn (1983). [https://books.google.com/books?id=nvHVAAAAMAAJ ''The World Encyclopedia of Cartoons''], Volume 4. London: Chelsea House Publishers. {{ISBN|9780877543992}}. p. 495. Accessed August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; He also went to the [[London College of Communication|London College of Printing]] and East Ham Technical College (became [[Newham College of Further Education]]).{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

==Career==

===Early work===
After briefly working in advertising, a profession he grew to dislike intensely, Scarfe's early [[caricature]]s of public figures were published in satirical magazine ''[[Private Eye]]'' throughout the 1960s and 1970s. Beginning in 1960, he produced illustrations for ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'', ''[[The Evening Standard]]'' and ''[[The Daily Sketch]]''. ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' magazine assigned Scarfe to cover the 1964 US Presidential election. He continued to work for ''The Sunday Times'' for two years, also producing several cover illustrations for ''Time'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Souter|first1=Nick|last2=Souter|first2=Tessa|title=The Illustration Handbook: A guide to the world's greatest illustrators|year=2012|publisher=Oceana|isbn=978-1-84573-473-2|page =307}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1960s he took a job at the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' following a [[Dutch auction]] for his services with the ''[[Daily Express]]''. His decision to work for the ''Daily Mail'' led to his estrangement from fellow cartoonist [[Ralph Steadman]], alongside whom he had studied art at East Ham Technical College. Soon after, Steadman was commissioned to illustrate Scarfe and "produced an image that was half saint and half Superman, but with a disconnected heart".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.cartoons.ac.uk/artists/ralphsteadman/biography|title=Ralph Steadman|type=biography|series=British Cartoon Archive|publisher=University of Kent}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Scarfe spent only one year working for the ''Daily Mail'', during which time he was sent to provide illustrations from the [[Vietnam War]].

===Pink Floyd and Roger Waters===
Scarfe was approached to work with [[Pink Floyd]] after [[Roger Waters]] and [[Nick Mason]] both saw his animated [[BBC]] film ''A Long Drawn Out Trip''. Pink Floyd's 1974 programme for their tour in the UK and US, in the form of a comic, included a centre-spread caricature of the band.&lt;ref name="MM"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Omnibus| isbn = 0711941092| last1 = Miles| first1 = Barry| last2 = Mabbett| first2 = Andy| title = Pink Floyd - The Visual Documentary| location = London| date = 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scarfe later produced a set of animated short clips used on the 1977 ''[[In the Flesh (1977 Pink Floyd 'Animals' tour)|In The Flesh]]'' tour, including a full-length music video for the song ''[[Welcome to the Machine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.rogerwaters.org/22/scarfeint.html|title=A Long Drawn-Out Trip: An Interview with Gerald Scarfe|first=Michael|last=Simone|journal=REG Magazine|issue=22}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scarfe also drew the illustrations for their 1979 album ''[[The Wall]]'' and provided animation for the subsequent [[The Wall Tour (1980-1981)|1980-1981 concert tour in support of that album]].&lt;ref name="MM" /&gt; In 1982, he worked on the [[Pink Floyd—The Wall|film version of ''The Wall'']], although he and Roger Waters fell out with director [[Alan Parker]] during the latter stages of editing.&lt;ref name="Mabbett3"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Omnibus| isbn = 9781849383707| last = Mabbett| first = Andy| title = Pink Floyd - The Music and the Mystery| location = London| date = 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well as the artwork, Scarfe contributed 15 minutes' worth of elaborate animation to the film, including a sequence depicting [[The Blitz|the German bombing campaign over England during World War II]], set to the song "[[Goodbye Blue Sky]]". Some of the animated footage was not original to the film, having been produced for and used in the 1980-81 concert tour, as well as being featured in the 1979 [[music video]] for "[[Another Brick in the Wall|Another Brick in the Wall: Part 2]]".{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

Scarfe continued to work with Roger Waters after the latter left Pink Floyd, creating the graphics and animation for Waters' solo album ''[[The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking]]'' (1984) and its supporting tour.&lt;ref name="Mabbett3" /&gt; Scarfe was also involved in subsequent theatrical adaptations of ''The Wall'', including [[The Wall Concert in Berlin]] (1990),&lt;ref name="Mabbett3" /&gt; and Waters' worldwide [[The Wall Live (2010-2013)]] tour, where his animations were projected on a vast scale. Scarfe's collaboration with Waters was marked in 2008 by the release of a signed limited-edition eight-print series, "Scarfe on the Wall", which contained a monograph book with an extended new interview with Scarfe and was signed by Roger Waters. Early editions of "Scarfe on The Wall" (by date of pre-order, not issue number) came with an additional print giving a total of nine in the set - making these the rarest and most valuable sets. In 2010, Scarfe's book ''The Making of Pink Floyd: The Wall'' was published, detailing the artist's work with Pink Floyd and Roger Waters from 1974-2010. The book contains contributions from Floyd members Roger Waters, Nick Mason, and [[David Gilmour]], as well as director of the film, Alan Parker.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

===''The Fall And Rise Of Reginald Perrin''===
He designed the 'Grot' logo for the BBC TV series '[[The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin]]'

===''Yes Minister''===
He provided caricatures of [[Paul Eddington]], Sir [[Nigel Hawthorne]] and [[Derek Fowlds]] (as their respective characters) for the opening and closing sequences of ''[[Yes Minister]]'' and ''[[Yes, Prime Minister]]''. {{When|date=June 2014}} {{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

===''Hercules''===
Scarfe was approached to work on the 1997 [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] film ''[[Hercules (1997 film)|Hercules]]'' by [[Ron Clements]] and [[John Musker]], longtime fans who had risen to prominence within Disney following the success of ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 movie)|The Little Mermaid]]''. Scarfe worked as a conceptual character artist, designing almost all of the characters and then supervising the 900 Disney artists charged with adapting his designs for the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Membery|first1=York|title=Political drawing-room|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/187b3638-54d6-11e0-96f3-00144feab49a.html|accessdate=24 July 2016|work=Financial Times|date=25 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Postage stamps===
The [[Royal Mail]] used Scarfe's artwork for a set of five [[Commemorative stamp|commemorative postage stamps]], issued on 23 April 1998. Honoring British comedians, the stamps feature Scarfe caricatures of [[Tommy Cooper]], [[Eric Morecambe]], [[Joyce Grenfell]], [[Les Dawson]] and [[Peter Cook]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=The laugh post!|newspaper=[[Daily Record (Scotland)]]|date=2 March 1998|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-60569181.html|accessdate=25 January 2014}}{{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/82259.stm|title=Comic genius is licked|date=23 April 1998|publisher=BBC|work=News.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=26 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Millennium Dome sculpture===
He was invited to create a sculpture for the [[Millennium Dome]], which was entitled "Self Portrait". The Dome's chief executive PY Gerbeau said "it mirrors what we like — and what we don't — about our nation".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/in_depth/uk/2000/dome_tour/portrait.stm|publisher=BBC|newspaper=News|title=Tour the Dome|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theatre/stage design===
Scarfe has designed sets for a number of operatic productions, including an adaptation of [[Roald Dahl]]'s ''[[Fantastic Mr Fox]]''. Following a chance meeting at a [[BBC]] prom he worked with [[Peter Hall (theatre director)|Peter Hall]] on his version of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart's]] ''[[The Magic Flute]]'', which drew critical acclaim. He is lined up to provide animation for ''[[Jim Steinman]]'s [[Bat Out of Hell]]'', a stage show featuring Steinman's music.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jimsteinman.blogspot.com|first=Jim|last=Steinman|title=Entry incorrectly dated 20 July, 06:603PM; it was actually posted on 20 October 2006}}.&lt;!--blog written by Jim Steinman, talking about his own stage show.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Scarfe designed the sets and costumes for the English National Opera's 1988 production of ''[[Orpheus in the Underworld]]''; among the costumes Scarfe designed were those of the characters Orpheus, Eurydice, and the Gods of Mount Olympus. He also produced all the costume and scenery designs for the 2002 [[Christopher Hampson]] production of ''[[The Nutcracker]]'', for the [[English National Ballet]]. {{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

===Heroes and Villains===
In 2003 Scarfe collaborated with the [[National Portrait Gallery (London)|National Portrait Gallery]] and [[BBC Four]] to make caricatures of a number of famous Britons, to depict (along with guest commentary) their heroic and villainous attributes.  Amongst the over 30 portraits he depicted included caricatures of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], [[Winston Churchill]], [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]], [[Pete Best]], [[Richard Branson]], [[Adam Smith]], [[William Blake]], [[The Beatles]], [[Agatha Christie]] and [[Diana, Princess of Wales]]. In 2009, he also created a caricature of [[James May]] out of [[Lego]] which was shown in episode 5 of [[James May's Toy Stories#Lego (Episode 5)|James May's Toy Stories]].  Scarfe and [[Jane Asher]] also appeared in the episode. {{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

===Netanyahu cartoon===
In its edition of 27 January 2013 (Britain's [[Holocaust Memorial Day (UK)|Holocaust Memorial Day]]), London's ''[[The Sunday Times|Sunday Times]]'' published a cartoon by Scarfe depicting Israel's Prime Minister [[Binyamin Netanyahu|Benjamin Netanyahu]] paving a wall with the blood and bodies of [[Palestinians]], captioned "Israeli elections—will cementing peace continue?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title='Sunday Times' mocks Holocaust with Israel cartoon|author=JPost.com staff|newspaper=The Jerusalem Post|date=27 January 2013|url=http://www.jpost.com/Headlines/Article.aspx?id=301129|accessdate=26 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cartoon's timing and content was criticised by groups including the [[European Jewish Congress]] and the [[Board of Deputies of British Jews]], with accusations of [[antisemitism]] leveled against Scarfe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.jta.org/news/article/2013/01/27/3117916/offensive-anti-israel-cartoon-in-londons-sunday-times-called-blood-libel |title=Offensive anti-Israel cartoon in London’s Sunday Times called blood libel |publisher=JTA |date=7 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130131005541/http://www.jta.org/news/article/2013/01/27/3117916/offensive-anti-israel-cartoon-in-londons-sunday-times-called-blood-libel |archivedate=31 January 2013 |df=dmy }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4337679,00.html|title=Cartoon continues to stir controversy|publisher=ynetnews|accessdate=7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unaware the cartoon would appear on Holocaust Memorial Day,&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Lipman [http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/101023/scarfe-regrets-timing-sunday-times-netanyahu-cartoon "Scarfe "regrets timing" of Sunday Times Netanyahu cartoon"], ''The Jewish Chronicle'', 28 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Scarfe argued that the cartoon was clearly aimed specifically at Netanyahu and his policies, and were in response to his election, rather than being related to Holocaust Memorial Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/jewish-world-news/four-reasons-why-u-k-cartoon-of-netanyahu-isn-t-anti-semitic-in-any-way.premium-1.496880|title=Four reasons why UK cartoon of Netanyahu isn't anti-semitic in any way|newspaper=Ha’aretz|first=Anshel|last=Pfeffer}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/outcry-over-uk-papers-cartoon-showing-bloody-israeli-oppression|title=Outcry over UK paper's cartoon showing bloody Israeli oppression|newspaper=The Times of Israel}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The newspaper's proprietor, [[Rupert Murdoch]], apologised for the cartoon on [[Twitter]], and acting editor [[Martin Ivens]] promised to be more vigilant in future.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-21239917 "Rupert Murdoch apologises over Gerald Scarfe cartoon"], BBC News, 29 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The cartoon was published in the Israeli newspaper ''[[Haaretz]]'', where [[Anshel Pfeffer]] discusses the cartoon in great detail, giving four reasons why, in his opinion, the cartoon is not antisemitic.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Gardner and Anshel Pfeffer [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jan/29/is-the-sunday-times-cartoon-antisemitic "Is the Sunday Times cartoon antisemitic?"], ''The Guardian'', 29 January 2013. The citation featured a reprint of the ''Haaretz'' article by Pfeffer, which is only available via subscription on the original site.&lt;/ref&gt; Writer [[Howard Jacobson]] claimed the cartoon was not antisemitic.&lt;ref&gt;Howard Jacobson.

===''Recycled Radio''===
Since June 2013, Scarfe has presented a programme on [[BBC Radio 4]] called ''Recycled Radio'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/jun/01/next-weeks-radio|title=Next week's radio: from Recycled Radio to 5 Live's Big Day Out|first=David|last=Hepworth|work=The Guardian|date=1 June 2013|accessdate=18 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is described as "the chopped-up, looped-up, sped-up world...where old programmes are reused to explore a series of weighty subjects".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04f23qy|title=Recycled Radio|publisher=BBC Radio 4|accessdate=18 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bristol Charity Auction 

In Oct 2013, Scarfe donated his time to decorate one of the large Wallace &amp; Gromit statues to be auctioned for the Bristol hospital charity https://www.bbc.com/news/av/entertainment-arts-24394027/gromit-statue-auction-raises-23m-for-bristol-hospita that was featured live on the BBC. His contribution finally ending up being sold to an internet bidder from Miami Florida where the statue was exported into a private collection, ultimately topping all estimates on value with a bid second highest only to the Pixar statue contribution.
